It started to rain and we were allowed inside with the dog. (Unusual for a Spanish restaurant). Beautiful swimming pool. Short walk (5 minutes) to the beach in a beautiful bay along shops, supermarkets and restaurants. We managed to drive up the Montgó with an electric bicycle!"
90564,2846821,3,MClari,12/06/2023,"The location of the campsite is good. What we did not like, that on the day of arrival we asked if there was a reservation in the same plot and they told me no, in order to have some flexibility at check out, since the camping was at 60%. But the last day, at the reception, they did not send us to leave because there was a reservation. What a coincidence!!"
90564,2786137,5,myichaliyna,25/05/2023,"Amazing camping! Very well kept, trees all around, large and flat pitches, lovely receptionist. Price is fair for what you get: 58 euros for 2 nights, 2 ppl with camper and car."

90564,2381656,5,Diekmann,18/09/2022,"Sanitary staff very clean nice. Pitches large and with lots of shade. The ground dusty earth with a lot of stones in the lower area. Bring sturdy pegs and a heavy hammer. At the weekend many permanent campers, so a lot of children screaming. But otherwise very quiet. Negative: the space for dogs right next to the pool in the north. Lots of dog poo! We'd love to come back!!!"
90564,2286286,1,befa69,22/08/2022,"Unacceptable! Monday, August 22, I call the campsite at 6 p.m. to find out if we can camp overnight in a van. No problem for the receptionist, she invites us to come and introduce ourselves at the reception. We take the road and arrive at 7 p.m. Arrived on site we go to the reception and after one of their employees saw us arrived and whispered something in the ear of the receptionist, the rules suddenly changed and they no longer accept visitors for less than 10 nights because supposedly too difficult to control! August 20 is a joke! Judgment to the facies hello! Haughty gaze not even a little goodbye, to flee."

90564,1204753,1,jap76,18/05/2021,"Camping 'resort' which means that it is full of bungalows and seasonal plots, very few AC or other means of camping. We arrived on Friday at 10:05 p.m., in May, low season, because on Sunday at 1 p.m. they tell me that I pay € 10 more or I have to go, it is already past 12.

90593,677079,5,Buntereise,05/09/2019,"Great place of power. Total peace, right on the lake. Was alone there. With my Bulli 3.5 t I could easily drive to the water. Although there is no shade, but thanks to the pleasant water no problem for me. If you are looking for peace is right here, from time to time I felt like on Mars. No man no animal far and wide."

90612,2658383,1,FFICUS,10/04/2023,"Well-prepared area, but it is a shame that the municipality invests in a space as welcoming as this, so that groups of rude young people throw stones at the motorhomes that come to enjoy the area and the town. I do not understand how the City Council, after this type of investment, allows this type of action."

At 3 in the morning a group of children making a hookah next to the car, my husband shows up because of the noise they are making and they start throwing stones at us at the front windows. It would be necessary to put video surveillance cameras at least so they deter this type of individual."
90612,2636997,5,IBakkenI,03/04/2023,"Very nice space with the possibility of emptying and refilling. There is also free electricity for 12 cars on the site. Shop 150 meters away. There is a dog kennel on site. This is a free space, so you cannot sit and expect it to be completely quiet at all times of the day. I heard the first train at 07:10 this morning, and there were people sitting and playing cards throughout the evening. They must be allowed to do this :)"
90612,2635143,3,guillemc89,02/04/2023,It's good that it's free and it has to deposit black and gray water. I would not sleep here again at least on the weekend. In the park next door there were people making noise until 3am...
90612,2624973,3,Josucho,26/03/2023,Car area with everything. Children's and dog park right next door. Perfect for 1 night. Somewhat noisy due to having the train track next to it and a sports area with youth day and night.

90612,2485411,3,Abril20,06/11/2022,Uneven and lighted gravel area next to the sports area. Free water and potty services. The potty emptying place lacks hygiene and the lid. There is no light; it is broken and not working. Pipican with agility games in front of him. Area next to the town and the train tracks.

The faucets cannot be adapted to almost any hose and the two, sewage and clean water, are very close together, in addition to the fact that sewage does not have a lid and all this can cause infections."
90612,2149519,4,anaislrns,31/07/2022,"Noisy until 11 p.m., the train passes by air. But from that hour, we were quiet. Water and electricity is present on the air as well as garbage cans. Nice view of Montserrat."

90612,1979665,5,MontseFortuny,15/06/2022,Clean and tidy area. Quiet. On foot you have all means of transport and medical area. Commercial area and old town 3 minutes. Impeccable.

90612,1835106,4,GJW,18/04/2022,The parking lot itself is not very nice but the view is overlooking Montserrat and a safe place to park your camper. There is also a nice playground for children with picnic tables! and on the other side also a skating rink. You walk straight into the village. The people are friendly. Empty dirty water/toilet and refill water. We stayed there for two nights and slept well.

90612,724721,1,legcat,18/10/2019,We intended to spend the night but we go to another place .... many people ... bad pints ...
90612,714537,3,decano1980,06/10/2019,Very flirty area with gray and black emptying. It is right behind a dog park so it was difficult for me to find it at night. The site is very well peeeero is right next to the train track so if you are a shallow sleeper you will wake up for sure! Abundant traffic and concentration of tuned cars on Sunday morning (I don't know if it will be very usual or it was only this day). Tables and benches nearby and games for children.
90612,661509,2,sodeuxde,26/08/2019,"Water but no tap, and near the dog play park. Not very reassuring. And little room behind the playground. Not recommended. Or just to empty the greywater"

90612,537491,5,AndamosMochileando,03/07/2019,Good place to clear gray and black waters. You can also fill the white water tank. It can also be used to fill out cheap gasoline for explosion / bonito

90612,411350,2,Onfire,02/12/2018,To park very well. There are routes to make the area. To sleep badly At least one Saturday there were people making dumb and high music. We had to go somewhere else to sleep.

90612,378765,3,DreamerD42,21/09/2018,Good to spend the night. The area is not signposted. It can be emptied but it does not crack water from the faucets. Parking spaces not delimited and with slight slope. There are not many train passes so do not bother too much
90612,377882,2,gilpau,20/09/2018,It is very well equipped and protected from the street. It has a fountain next to and a picnic table area. The problem is that it has the train track just next to it and the first hour the train wakes up

Unfortunately a little spoiled by this ban from 10 p.m. to 10 a.m. ... we didn't feel comfortable as soon as there were walkers passing in front of us, the guardia rural passed around 7 p.m. without telling us anything but in looking at the vehicle for several minutes ... in short, that's perfect, except for this point! To know why it is forbidden? Perhaps a natural area, so be very careful with your waste, do not make noises, do not take out tables + chairs, etc."

No dolphins in the morning, but the fishermen raising their traps. See also the Guardia Civil at 9:30 which has just passed without stopping. It must be said that we had not released table / chairs or other. Can be scattered around several vehicles."

Previously, on a beach I asked a local policeman to see if there was a problem sleeping with the van and roof up. He said no, as long as we didn't make noise or take things out like in a camping, no problem. So when arriving and being this busy place we were a few meters before parked next to some houses with the beach next to it. Very good, very quiet and beautiful sunset."

But there is a disco (or whatever) on the beach opposite, the wind blows towards us, result: we have to speak out loud so it's going strong. We hear nothing: neither the sea, nor the birds, nor the road ... nothing but this music and this DJ who screams in his microphone."
90680,540880,5,Garyvalou,06/07/2019,Perfect !!! Wonderful !!! We stayed a week without problems with the police. In fact there are several (3/4) possible locations for DC 6m max. Saw dolphins almost every day. Beautiful place so preserve the pick up your garbage !!!!!

90680,398583,5,yapagare,24/10/2018,"Idyllic, maybe it's one of the top 10 places I've slept in, spectacular views. you have to keep several things in mind, take care of large vehicles, keep an eye on the road before you go, and keep an eye on the site since it only fits one? the site seems to be set so that only one is alone, now it is amazing to sleep there!"
90680,395229,4,craigjames,18/10/2018,"Stayed a night, really peaceful but just so much rubbish, 4 stars for location, but people need to pick up litter, not sure if you can swim, as there’s lots of pipes feeding into the sea from factory’s so we didn’t risk it.

90681,2853767,3,JosCiel,14/06/2023,"Incredibly beautiful picnic area, but we think it is not suitable for longer vehicles (we are 7 meters tall ourselves) because then you have to stand crosswise and occupy 3 or 4 parking spaces. On the grassy area on the right-hand side when you arrive there is a sign saying 'No Acampar'. For those two reasons we drove on again. Toilets were also not (yet) open..."
90681,2614069,5,AsturVanFamily,18/03/2023,Large area to park and spend the night. In low season they do not usually say nothing to remove a chair during the day. It has a large esplanade with wooden tables and chairs. Spectacular views of the Eo estuary.

90681,2288296,4,pitufaT5,23/08/2022,"I have spent a very good night with 3 or 4 other campers. The only noise you will hear will be that of the waves, also with beautiful views."

90681,1962297,4,moetje,09/06/2022,A great place! Some expect too much from municipalities! Remember that we are in a Canping Car and that this type of vehicle is generally equipped with toilets and showers!! So no need to use public toilets!!!

90692,2198239,3,flototoro,08/08/2022,"Parking overlooking a picnic area on the edge of a stream, at the start of a great hike around the remains of the iron mines. There is a boarding house for dogs next door, so a lot of barking including in the middle of the night… Despite the garbage cans, the site is very dirty, whether in the parking area or on the hike. Public toilet a little further down the road, towards a playground."
90692,2190524,3,carlgns,07/08/2022,Perfect place if it weren't for the dogs barking in the middle of the night.
90692,2096944,3,damizaa,20/07/2022,Superb place at the edge of a small torrent and above a short hike possible around the remains of an iron mine. A downside for a dog or even two who yelped for a good end of the night…
90692,1946156,4,quizmaster,04/06/2022,"Nice place to spend the night. Clean and ok. As previous users did, we bought a nice bottle of eco-cidre in the sidreria ola. The only problem was a dog barking in the middle of the night going on for hours… even with earplugs it was disturbing. Otherwise I would have rated the place 5/5."

90692,862344,4,Unai02,12/07/2020,Next to the Ola cider house. Quiet and safe. We were able to take a bottle of cider and take it in the motorhomes. There is a bike path to the border.
90694,3258393,4,Bastienvozelle,04/09/2023,"Beautiful beach, location of your choice (in September) bar and restaurant on site however swimming pool for a fee! Be careful, some locations are very sandy. Very reasonable price €26 per night with electricity."
90694,3213549,2,belenplaza,25/08/2023,"Very expensive for what it is, the pools, beach, etc. are worth it, but the pitches are very badly marked (the one they gave us was occupied) and looking for an available one we left the motorhome stuck, the pitches are pure sand and quite dirty."
90694,3196727,1,bert198,21/08/2023,"This more than a campsite is a shanty town. We arrived with a reservation, they gave us a plot that was already occupied and the receptionists told us to find our lives and to find an empty one and to get in. After an hour wandering around and without any solution from the campsite, we left. Another issue is a lot of cars going around the campsite driven by children"
90694,3125469,3,Camper_damah,11/08/2023,"The campsite is huge, there are a lot of people. and above all the dirty bathrooms with little maintenance. the beach is the best it has, it is beautiful. The pool area is good, spacious and with plenty of shade. supermarket, bar, buffet, burger, churreria, clothing store, ice cream parlor... if it weren't for the dirt, it would be much better"
90694,3114449,1,rossa,10/08/2023,"Huge and dirty campsite. We found the Pitch dirty with rubbish, as if no one had noticed the dirt for weeks. More like a busy city street than a campsite, where cars come and go all day long. Decent services. The saddest thing is the dirt on the beach, without care and full of rubbish. We escaped after one night"
90694,3111884,4,CaravelaPortuguesa,10/08/2023,"Large campin with a private beach with an extensive stretch of sand, the access is inclined and with a slope, but it's good. Large pool, a pity it's only from midday. There is a supermarket inside the park and several cafes. A negative point is that the plots for motorhomes are small and have few bathrooms. At rush hour there is a queue for the shower."

The negative point is that the pool, despite being very large and with an area for children, was a bit dirty. For the rest, a mandatory stop to spend a few days!"
90694,2970363,1,sergiomoron,16/07/2023,"Reading the previous comments to say that all the reason in the world, a lawless city, we rarely come to this area but it is not adapted for motorhomes, nor is the camping or the area very expensive, no matter how you look at it, this area is not for motorhomes"
90694,2970080,1,Mardecristi79,15/07/2023,"We have been coming for many years, but what we have seen this year is sad, it seems like 3,000 homes, a lot of riffraff has gotten in, loud music in the pool, noise and people yelling until 1 in the morning at the earliest and cars It also circulates until 1 o'clock, it has a good and very large pool, but there are more people, the premium plots they have for motorhomes are very abandoned,"
90694,2927137,4,liberty123,05/07/2023,"camping with many plots, be careful that some have a lot of sand, there is no paper in the bathrooms. clean facilities. In 5 minutes walking you arrive at a beautiful beach and not crowded. great pool. good food in restaurants, some things a bit expensive"
90694,2922129,1,carlos110978,04/07/2023,"This is not suitable for large motorhomes. We took plot C premium. It was very difficult for us to settle in one, but the worst thing is to leave since the caravans are installed as they please without anyone telling them anything. All very dirty. It is like a ""village"" without law. Kids driving cars, teenagers smoking joints everywhere. If you want tranquility this is not your campsite."
90694,2911371,1,turrutucutu,01/07/2023,"Premium plot. Full of weeds. Pitches without shade. Very dirty bathrooms and continuous power cuts. Few sinks and flooded. A large influx of very disrespectful people, smoking joints in common areas like the pool, carrying speakers, driving at high speed, taking many people in the car. In short, a very bad ""premium"" experience. Not recommended for families."
90694,2908343,2,pepita972,30/06/2023,"Very large and very popular campsite, the pitches are average with lots of vis-à-vis. 50 euros for a camping car and 2 people with electricity. Very noisy."

Everything perfect, except for cleaning, really dirty bathrooms and sinks, they have several modules and half of them were closed, little daily cleaning, at 8:00 p.m. there was no paper and the state of the bathrooms was insane until the next day. What will it be in summer?"
90694,2805549,4,Tamlac,31/05/2023,"Frankly, good surprise, Price for 2 nights 36 euros, motorhome 2 adults and a dog with EdF, we extended 2 nights and the 10 euros per night, superb swimming pool and access to the nearby sea, be careful a lot of pitches on sand but also on slab and in this quiet period. water on each plot.

This bridge has been completed. It is not too suitable for motorhomes. Gray only at the start. Plots with a lot of sand (my friend got stuck). That said, with the pool and the beach it has, they don't need to take care of details to fill."
90694,2653767,1,Elcristo88,09/04/2023,"The pools, the entertainment and everything very, very good and the staff are great, but what a pity the sand plots. 3 times my partner's motorhome got stuck, so the first day we arrived lost with the traffic jams, it was impossible to park it because it was just going to step on the sand, they have prepared to remove it but it's a bitch, it fell apart and the lower beam of the chassis bent"
90694,2638838,3,Europa2023,04/04/2023,"Unkept places. If you like large mass camping you should definitely go here, everything is there. Bathrooms are old and toilets not clean. Beautifully situated by the sea."

90694,2590380,4,die2,25/02/2023,When we on 10.2. arrived here only a few places were occupied. Costs 12 euros including everything in the off-season. Showers were always clean. Poor WLAN on the concrete CP. Restaurante open daily fresh bread in the supermarket. Good basic range and super nice staff On the weekends the locals come and it can get louder. We spent very quiet days here.

90694,2416375,5,flocasaro,01/10/2022,Great camping. Very large pitches with water and electricity at each place. Beautiful beach of fine sand. It's great to hang out during this time. In the summer I have some doubts as it is certainly very crowded.

90694,2213497,1,raulalonso,10/08/2022,"Huge campsite with too many people for the services it offers. The sandy pitches, the services and toilet areas are super crowded during peak hours. Maintenance leaves a lot to be desired. The noise until very late and the guards do not take action. Very sandy pitches with poor conditions for motorhomes. The only virtue is the beach, which is fantastic. We won't be back."

Various camping alternatives, perfect toilets in maintenance and cleaning. The staff very willing to serve you and various restaurants and a well-stocked supermarket to have what you need. Highly recommended especially to enjoy with family. Direct access to the beach which is very comfortable."
90694,2087494,1,lal0u,17/07/2022,"We do not recommend this campsite. Pitches are very dirty. We had a site with dog droppings, cigarette butts and other rubbish.... a small and sandy site. The toilets are really not great, the showers are old and broken for some. Only positive point: close to the sea."
90694,2069593,1,jagomsah,13/07/2022,"They gave us an occupied plot, the sand in the squares is very loose (just like on the beach!) and the front wheel of the ACV sank,..... they don't answer the phone and when they arrive, they tell you no they have shovel and they call my insurance to get out. I'm not going back anywhere near!!!!"
90694,2041260,1,jlrz,05/07/2022,"Not recommended... Sanitary facilities are broken and always dirty! Restaurant sells ready-made pizzas as if they were fresh... and the Spanish long-term campers have the feeling that your place is a playground... and as if that wasn't enough, we paid 49 euros for one night for two in a van. Once and never again!!!"

The staff is super nice, but the price was updated to 8 euros which I've found a bit overpriced. Besides, the grey water dumping area is completely way from the place to fill up water and dispose the toilet. Was also difficult to access far a larger van which I would understand if this wasn't a place built for, guess what, vans!"
90694,1955382,5,omp1910,07/06/2022,Stayed from 05/19 to 05/21 / We paid €16.50 for the first night and €24.50 for the second (including electricity). Perfect for a campsite with a pool. The best and special are the huge pitches under pine trees. Each pitch has its own rubbish bin and you can hang up your hammock. Super quiet at night. Perfect as a stop between Seville and Portugal.
90694,1953772,3,flow111,06/06/2022,"The place is very big and very crowded in the main session. Many families. The beach was ok. The sanitary facilities were ok, but could have been cleaner. WiFi was only available at the reception. Okay for one night, otherwise we missed the feel-good factor. We also found €24.50 (2 people + camper) too expensive for one night. (That was the price of the side session)"
90694,1931274,3,mcFlyby,30/05/2022,Clean bathrooms with sockets for driers. Very kid friendly so not our thing. Restaurant and bar okay. Washing machines not great. Beach access very steep and beach not as nice as the pictures look. Pitches spacious but sandy and litter not collected enough. We stayed one night €24.50 expensive we felt
90694,1919309,3,Stefan_Berlin,26/05/2022,"... since you don't have more characters available, here's my continuation: actually. a great place if it wasn't for the noise at night. Somehow the place has established itself as a party mile for the locals. Boxes are dragged over - spotlights are installed and the thumping of the bass can be heard across almost the entire square. Despite pleas (also from Spaniards to their compatriots) there was no mercy."
90694,1919299,3,Stefan_Berlin,26/05/2022,"actually a great place - huge - from the pitches near the coast to the reception it is almost 1000 meters. Place is not directly on the sea, but has direct beach access. About 150 meters path through the dunes. Occupancy at 20% at the end of May. Very nice pitches under umbrella pines - in the pre-season you can choose your pitch (also use the premium pitches, for the same price)"
90694,1896489,4,DieterundKatrin,17/05/2022,"Great in the early season. Cheap (14€ for campers and 2 adults per night), very empty, big pools and great beach. Good for relaxing after Seville sightseeing on the way to Portugal"

By settling on an isolated pitch without shade, we were able to take advantage of the calm of the environment while tasting the advantages of a campsite with all options. Huge swimming pool nice in this season. Relatively clean toilets. Friendly and professional staff. Direct access to the beach."
90694,1809654,5,OxidoR.M.,07/04/2022,"A good campsite to spend a few days, it has a restaurant, a supermarket, a very good swimming pool although it was closed now, the toilets are clean, the concrete pitches are almost all for small motorhomes, but most of them are dirt and uneven. access to the beach is up a fairly steep slope, but it is worth going."
90694,1809098,3,Hugues02,07/04/2022,"Muddy ground after a rain. Impossible to walk there. Concrete pitches are not suitable for large motorhomes. The others mostly unstabilized. Shade frame too low. Presence of 200 schoolchildren 200 more expected on the weekend, so formidable nights to be expected. Beware of potholes on the access to the campsite. Didn't stay. Very friendly welcome in French."
90694,1796088,5,baedl,26/03/2022,"I've known him for years and I absolutely recommend it. 4* campsite is located in the middle of a huge nature reserve with a great, endless sandy beach. €14.50 (1 person, dog, electricity 6A), from the 3rd day €11.62 in the off-/early season. Free, stable WiFi everywhere. Pure peace... space is not even 5% full at the end of March. Mostly sandy soils, but there are some concrete ones."
90694,1779513,3,FritzFitz,10/03/2022,"Great beach where you can walk for a long time or ride a bike. Toilets clean, toilet paper available, nice staff, two people dog electricity caravan with car for 7 nights 104 €. There is sand everywhere on the campsite, a huge mess in the caravan and everywhere!!! Furthermore, the place is right next to a military area, can be very noisy."
90694,1779035,2,delacotte,10/03/2022,Looks good but announced 14€ but charge 23€ for everything no rest
90694,1778296,3,freeman1612,09/03/2022,"Huge space, so you can choose a nice place to be super secluded, especially in the off-season - options: open sandy parking space, space in the coniferous forest or concrete space. Beach is beautiful and directly accessible. Supermarket is very good. Sanitary facilities just OK for the price."
90694,1775509,1,Bugpachren,06/03/2022,"We went for just the services, gray water, chemical toilet and clean water. It is not 6€ but 10 that we paid. a feeling of having been robbed. Drinking water same pipe as for cleaning chemical toilets, it's disgusting. A quick overview of the place... not very neat and old. No other places in the region and we refuse to empty our waters in nature like some."
90694,1773078,5,Tina229,04/03/2022,"Out of season a perfect place. Wide paths and large squares. The restaurant and the camping shop are open. And to top it all off, a huge beautiful sandy beach."
90694,1772671,3,Haemmi,04/03/2022,"Huge camping site with all services, near the beach. Very good to start hikes and bike tours through the pine woods. Very quiet and empty now (off season). Facilities are clean. Some rubbish on a few spots. The overfilled rubbish containers have been emptied finally. WiFi is available, but of poor quality."
90694,1772284,5,JAS21ONTOUR,03/03/2022,We planned to stay for four nights and eventually left after 15!  Great place to relax and unwind and we had lovely days out exploring the surrounding national park on our mountain bikes.  Reception/bar staff all speak excellent English.

No hot water in the toilets, the washing machines are not maintained even when they are dirty. The emptying of the toilet is done in an old toilet with an inconvenient hose."

Washing machines perfectly okay and clean. We'll definitely be back when the pool is open. it looks incredibly good! 2 adults plus child plus motorhome only 16 €! Top price

90694,1674084,3,juanpe.vert1g0,01/11/2021,"Campig only for the off-season, hell in summer. If you stand outside the concrete part, it is very important to pay attention to the soil of the plot, since some are sand traps, and you get stuck easily."
90694,1659046,4,acinipo,23/10/2021,"We have stayed 3 days and 3 nights, and the services are very clean, we were in the middle of the campsite and the beach is quite far, and the cars do not go at 10 and they get quite dusty otherwise everything is fine, the staff are very correct and friendly, van, dog, two people without electricity € 15 per day, in low season it is very affordable."
90694,1648713,4,mapicalat,17/10/2021,"In October there are pitches to choose from. The beach is nearby, and from there you can see the area. We use it to spend the night, because it is near the Acebuche, from where buses leave, visit Doñana National Park. The clean toilets and laundry area."

The beach is beautiful, the pool very nice, full mini market ... I come back as soon as possible .."
90694,1607704,3,RaoulKLEIN,25/09/2021,Arrived in September there are plenty of places. The pitches are rather small and well shaded. I think that in the middle of the season we have to be slightly on top of each other. beach access and friendly. the natural park is approximately 20 km away.
90694,1606825,5,antotejas,25/09/2021,"For us the best campsite in the province. The pools are a joy, especially for children. In the pool restaurant you eat super well. The modern and clean bathrooms are cleaned non-stop. There are facilities to bathe babies. Perhaps in season it can be somewhat crowded, but outside of it it is a highly recommended place."
90694,1604970,4,Babuneta,24/09/2021,"Ok for us because we negotiate low season price € 15 / night (in principle they asked us € 22 / night for a van for 2 people without electricity at the end of September, expensive) and very quiet at this time. Most sandy camping area but with shade. Renovated ok bathrooms. Pool very well: lawn, children's area, bar. Access to the beach with its own parking. Good location to visit the beaches of Doñana"
90694,1515218,1,jancablemanhymerc524sl,26/08/2021,"Overcrowded camping in August. Covid masks shone by their absence. Queues in the bathrooms all day, pitches with butts and uncomfortable due to sandy, car racking at all hours..dirty beach and full containers..I don't think we will return"
90694,1504468,2,ilundu,23/08/2021,"Very large but expensive campsite. Most pitches are sandy and you get caught easily. The first plot that they gave us fatal, they had to take us out and at the entrance they had not told us anything about what the plots were like. The pitches are full of cigarette butts (although this is not entirely the responsibility of the campsite ... Let's see if we get more awareness)"
90694,1406123,4,Ivil,04/08/2021,"Very good facilities. Constant cleaning, huge pool, many activities direct access to the beach. They ask for the technical sheet to buy the homologation."

90694,1384315,4,Elvis18,30/07/2021,"The camping facilities are good, the pitches are spacious and the bathrooms clean. The problem is the people, it seems like a redneck camp where everyone honks: Dario eat er zangüi !! Maribé! where is the towel? Dario and Maribé were 12 inches from the speakers. A shame because the camping is great, I advise to come out of season or after a zombie apocalypse."
90694,1341556,2,dawsonmg,19/07/2021,"It has many sandy pitches with low awnings. We get hooked. In addition, the staff (or at least the one who attended us) did not inform us of almost anything and was overwhelmed by the influx. They have a single dryer for the entire campsite, there are no clotheslines ... Of course: beautiful beach, large pool and several food options and super in the same enclosure."
90694,1327602,1,jcguerreroes,15/07/2021,Attention! They do not allow sleeping in a van if it is not approved as a home van. I've gone and had to turn around.

In high season and in the cheapest area, per adult (€ 8.50) and van (€ 10) you should pay € 18.50 but they charge you € 31.50 because it is the minimum per pitch! Wow, they penalize you for traveling alone !!! Obviously, I have not passed the entrance!"
90694,1300086,4,Puytri,06/07/2021,Good ubication. The beach is great and the pools very good. The bathrooms were spotless with people cleaning continuously. The weekend can be a bit crowded and the issue of filling water for motorhomes has not been well resolved.
90694,1291979,3,NilsausdemNorden,02/07/2021,"One of the largest squares in southern Spain. Stayed there in May, so in the low season, for two relaxing nights. In the main season it has to be like being in a big city. Sanitary facilities are getting old but ok. The pool was loved by our kids. The playgrounds too, but they urgently need maintenance."
90694,1288622,3,germand,01/07/2021,"Nice place to enjoy nature, swimming pools and the beach. It has a chiringuito, ice cream parlor and a market that has the basics. The pitches are good, but be careful as some are very soft sand and there is a risk of stagnation. Very unkempt and dirty bathrooms and showers. There are washers and dryers for € 3. The music of some neighbors is very loud."

Good resort campsite, with all that this entails, good pool facilities and bar, restaurant and beach bar, direct access to the beach, a fairly complete supermarket, in high season it is overcrowded and the bathrooms are not always as clean as they should be, it is very large , from the reception to the beach there is 1 kilometer, many landlines, many types of bulgalows, if you want a resort, it is very good.

90694,967789,4,JrRamone,15/08/2020,"Camping of 10, access to the beach a bit steep. The worst thing is that the plots are made of beach sand and you get stuck (they take it out with a tractor). It is best to park parallel to the plot."

Granxa do Xesto is the parking lot of the park, but it remains separate among the trees, not visible from the road. It's called Parking a Selva Negra and, after leaving the first parking lot on the right, there is a more hidden area at the back. We spent the evening and the night there, peacefully. From the top you can see all of Santiago, including the cathedral."

I recommend."

Package of 10 € for 2 4 € the adult 3 € (child) 3 € (child) Showers with unlimited access. The only downside is that the beautiful beach is 1km and you have to walk along the road without sidewalk on the first 300 meters. Otherwise it was 4 stars?

90875,442097,2,helenedaniel,20/03/2019,One night is ok. But apart from the beach nothing. So in winter. To the merit of existing. Disadvantages if you want to leave early in the morning impossible gate locked. Must wait 8:30 or 9h depending on the arrival of the owners. Fortunately a German who stayed there had a key and opened us.

90875,426914,5,ascot32,05/02/2019,"I often come to this park camper. The team is nice and very helpful. When I read the review on the drain, I am outraged. This camper park is located by the sea and I know that he needs to install a special dewatering infrastructure and would like to prefer this service to his customers. Only 10 euros you have everything for free. To criticize is therefore not very intelligent"
90875,426893,1,gfenn05,05/02/2019,We looked at the place because we wanted to stop here for a few days on the way back. When we asked if we could empty the toilet you were immediately unfriendly and said that costs 6 EUR which was a bit too expensive. So you shed potential customers. We will stop on another nice pitch on the way back.

By cons: - No wifi as indicated, - Very limited privacy for toilets and showers (simple curtains to close the 2 showers by building, we see the pants lowered on the feet under the doors from outside), - Attention at the price.

90875,415331,2,Bayimages,22/12/2018,Friendly new place that has potential to be good. Sadly won’t be back as it’s noisy with dogs and roosters and road. The toilet/shower facilities are locked between 19:00 and 09:00 which is crazy.  Never before have I been to a paid site where they lock them.  Also very cramped in the showers with no where to hang clothes which means you have to get dressed and undressed in the wash area.  Needs a re think on layout and the locking of facilities.

90973,3076291,4,Mariafurgoneta,04/08/2023,"Very nice, green and quiet campsite, close to the town of A Fonsagrada (and without the crowds of other campsites). Two people spent one night in a camper (without electricity) for €20. Several nearby routes to walk between forests and waterfalls. The owner is very friendly and knows the area well. Simple showers with hot water."

Good way pilgrims."
90973,1545922,1,BenEnsminger,04/09/2021,Very very unfriendly owner accused me of trying to ripping him money of! Absolutely disgraceful behaviour I have never experienced such a bad campsite! To expensive for bad sanitary! I absolutely CANT recommend this campsite
90973,1426437,1,IkerCruz,09/08/2021,"Bad access, and a little disorganized the campsite. We had to leave, because due to the poor organization the AC could not fit in the assigned plot, having to go backwards to the entrance of the campsite."
90973,1289100,4,joselui,01/07/2021,"Family camping in an incredible environment! I loved it! Located in A Fonsagrada at 1000 m high. Almost 30 degrees by day and 10 at night. Mountain climate. Full nature and this supposes everything good and sometimes insects etc but nature is what it has .. Nice family and close treatment. If you go in a hurry and city rhythms, this is not your campsite."

We left, because it is like being in the house of terror, everything abandoned, a shame, because a fonsagrada does not deserve a campsite like that"

90976,990215,1,edupes,22/08/2020,Quiet place but this morning the foresters woke me up and told me that it is forbidden to spend the night outside the town that behind the health center there is a clearing and there it can be done legally. I have not been fined because apparently before there was a signal that someone has started.

90976,339371,5,LauraMarcDusk,17/08/2018,Very good location for spending a night with a van. We travel with a Peugeot Partner and it is a quiet and very comfortable area since you have a natural source and a sink. Very recommendable

91023,3086214,4,Gigie31,06/08/2023,"Huge picnic area by the river, in the shade with stone tables and barbecues. Out of politeness we asked the guinguette if we could sleep in their parking lot. We parked at the entrance to be away from the noise but despite the music, which was not loud, the place is calm and peaceful. We had a cocktail, very good and not expensive (compared to France!)."

At night around 11 p.m., 3 cars came spinning, but then they were silent until 5:30 a.m. in the morning they left also spinning, that's why I put 3 stars, otherwise I would put 5. The bathrooms are fine and there is hydro-alcoholic gel"

91033,1568706,3,MireiaLucia,11/09/2021,Land parking quite noisy as it is a bottle and spinning area. We spent the night and had no problem. The police passed by and evicted the young people who were making a racket but they didn't tell us anything.
91033,1484655,4,Petitbonhomme,19/08/2021,"We parked here to visit the city and the castle, about a 15 min walk, pedestrian center 5 min. Perfect and Flat. But we didn't sleep there"
91033,1429272,3,DavidRubioQuereda,09/08/2021,"Flat place, with a lot of room. There are no services, but you are almost in the center. Nearby supermarket and bars. It is free all day. During the day there are usually ""gorillas"". At night some noise especially on weekends because it is a ""bottle"" area. For one night and seeing the city and then going to the sanctuary of penha is fine."
91033,993276,3,Clawrence,23/08/2020,Very flat and close to the center. We were good. A bit noisy and a lot of movement at night. Maybe the one behind the castle is better. There are no services.
91033,789140,1,Mmmoustic,01/03/2020,Good for sightseeing but very noisy at night on Saturday! To be avoided at night.

91040,3038290,5,mathildepetit63,29/07/2023,Quiet night with some barking noises in the distance during the night but 0 problem! We were able to chat with the farmer from the field next door and parking for the night is ok but of course you have to respect the place and leave it clean despite the rubbish already there. The dogs were with the mr so this is normal and 0 concern. Spot to advise and super convenient with the highway!
91040,2965936,4,flolaborde,15/07/2023,we spent a cool night in the shade of the trees in the morning. secluded and very quiet place. ideal for a stopover not far from the motorway. the place is clean and quiet.
91040,2783999,4,abebess,25/05/2023,Very good quiet night. Not too far from the highway. Flawless
91040,2663440,5,BonnieVan,12/04/2023,"Very good night in the forest. The road to get there is passable although very dusty. The spot is perfect, isolated and secure to let the children play. I recommend"
91040,2450268,4,Sach-a,18/10/2022,"Nice place to stay, no one there and quiet night!"
91040,2433526,4,maximusjstn,09/10/2022,"Handy spot for one night. Access by slightly sandy and stony path but at 20 km/h it passes quietly. In the middle of a large plain, possibility of finding shade easily, several spots available so as not to stick to others if necessary. Actually a little dirty in places. A local runs his greyhounds on the road morning and evening. Nothing more seen!"
91040,2273307,5,TamiMannhardt,20/08/2022,"Path only sandy at the beginning, later driving at 20km/h otherwise a bit jerky. Otherwise great view, beautiful sunset and you have the entire forest to yourself (except for a few cyclists in the morning). At night possibly windy and a bit cool, otherwise quiet. We didn't notice any prostitutes and the dogs mentioned only came by with their owner in the morning."
91040,1859363,4,universalsv2003,29/04/2022,"Deserted and quiet place for 1 night. Most of it is completely covered with tall grass, which is very disturbing when it rains."
91040,1758645,3,mosche3000,17/02/2022,"Hi. The place is totally beautiful, sunset, idyllic grove, quiet great nature. Also easy to reach for larger vehicles (we are traveling with a Sprinter, long wheelbase). The only problem: In the evening we noticed that 3 huge dogs were doing their rounds and barking at us. After 5 minutes they were gone again...had a strange feeling and drove away."
91040,984481,3,PaulNolles,20/08/2020,Okay for one night. Lots of flies.
91040,769989,4,Reisedude,18/01/2020,"Very nice place in a small forest. However, the access was very soft and there is a risk of getting stuck through the sand. It went well, but in winter it was rather unsuitable for large and heavy vehicles."
91040,591300,2,LeoManon,01/08/2019,"Nice place but be careful, probably a spot has prostitutes (condoms and wipes en masse at one place)"
91040,582567,4,Tely22,29/07/2019,Nice place to stay for the night. But Lots of toilet paper all over the ground unfortunately.
91040,484335,5,flyaway19,14/05/2019,"Brilliant! The only ones there were. It was very windy in the evening, but the next morning calm. The sat nav has taken us too long a route, there is also a shorter one from the road we took on the way back. Both ways and the pitch were great with our camper to drive (3.2 m high and 7.8 m long)"
91040,465882,3,pedrotransit,23/04/2019,"I have only gone to eat and rest and although I did not find the exact place, I found another one in the same group of trees but in another lane, maybe a500m. Easy access for camper, for motorhome perhaps more difficult but I would say that it enters without problem ... To day of today neither a tree with processionary, that I go with the podenqui!"

91040,339182,2,MattCC,17/08/2018,Warning it is a very windy place and not obvious access. Rather reserved for fighter in van rather than the owners of large camper with caravan. The last 2 kms are sandy with a fairly damaged path. It would also be good to pick up his trash when leaving ...
91040,328958,3,mela56,12/08/2018,"Correct place and isolated for one night and the ombr, by against a lot of rubbish on the ground, it's a shame!"
91040,328053,4,cecilequadra,11/08/2018,Indeed nice place although very busy when we passed. 1 camper and 2 vans arrived after us ... however we found traces of a fire is not a genius idea at this place.

91100,2630662,5,ep1c.adv.23,30/03/2023,"Great site, 15 minute walk into Benidorm. Paid €24.50 a night with no electric. Restaurants food was ok, cheap drinks and great customer service. Clean facilities, large pool and very large pitches. Few wifi in the restaurant."
91100,2545427,1,Krouge,07/01/2023,Much too expensive moreover the restaurant is not a restaurant but a canteen
91100,2528730,4,zitta79,26/12/2022,"Excellent location, by bike you can reach the seafront in an instant. Nice and clean campsite. The only downside is the non-existent Wi-Fi. In practice, the Wi-Fi is paid for but the receptionist advised me not to pay for it because it doesn't work well."
91100,2487736,3,Vandiamo,08/11/2022,"€29.60 Inc elec 2 people 1 camper 1 night quite expensive for out of season. Pleasant enough site, pool looked nice but didn’t use or any services. Great bike tracks from the site & all around Benidorm. This is the 2nd site where frustratingly the staff had to plug & unplug us for electricity and we had to wait 30mins when leaving for this to happen. Not ideal. We walked to the mirador in 30 mins"
91100,2269682,3,javeasteve5,19/08/2022,"Possibly better out of season but the F’ing & Blinding Drug dealing Brit’s in August(Not Motorhomers) spoil the bar/restaurant area.  Lots of shade, dated toilet blocks with feral kids in evenings playing/damaging them. Staff very good, helpful, friendly. Lots of kids entertainment, not a lot for adults. Electric good, powered air con with no problem. Good supermarket with fresh milk."
91100,2073412,5,Colbecks97,14/07/2022,"This is our second visit great location, friendly staff, it is a ten minute walk to the ‘strip’ if your looking for old town Benidorm is a 30min leisurely stroll. A must visit if passing through, lots of spaces available on our row."
91100,2020350,2,j.m.felice,29/06/2022,"In itself a beautiful campsite with a great pool area. Currently, however, with a major construction site in the middle of the square and without warning. As a result, considerable noise and dust pollution during the day. 7.00 a.m. wake up by excavator and vibrating plate. Therefore only conditionally recommended at the moment."
91100,1969542,3,LauryAgudo,12/06/2022,"Camping to visit Benidorm of what there is of situation for the place well although it has a good walk for all beach or center. Weekends are crazy, it fills up and the pool and the services do not provide for so many clientele. During the week it is a little more bearable but queues for showers and bathrooms."
91100,1887187,1,Qnapper,13/05/2022,"Woman in reception stated no dogs, that fine I said as we only have a cat that does not leave van. NO NO she says then no pets a all!!!!! - be aware. When to next site 2km away and no problem."

The beach (as well as the center) is 22 minutes on foot according to google maps and is also correct .. is therefore very doable."
91100,1775482,4,KaetMat31,06/03/2022,"very correct location for an integral motorhome. Clean toilets, hot water Ok. Close to shops, the beach with a little walk but very secure. Many English and Dutch residents, good family stay with children aged 6 and 12. I only put 4 stars because of the noise of heavy traffic at 6am for the pitches at the bottom of the campsite."
91100,1707227,4,MinNou,09/12/2021,"Nice camping. The bread from the mini-market is always freshly baked and crunchy. Camp-side is clean and so are the showers. A plus is the heater in the bathroom/toilettes. It's just a short bike ride to the beach. We've paid 40€ with ADAC card for 2nights and 2people in a van, electricity included."

91100,1583254,5,racingsant,16/09/2021,"Great Camping, a very good pool, the pitches are medium in size, perhaps the only negative point is that the bathrooms may need a reform, but they are kept clean which is the important thing."
91100,1531709,4,Suricatobike,30/08/2021,"Correct camping, good pool and well-maintained facilities, one downside is that the pitches have dirt floors and the motorhome stains a lot, the center is a bit far but Acualandia is very good to walk, the staff are very attentive. I recommend it."
91100,1463462,4,ktm4tiempos,15/08/2021,"Recommended, large pitches, clean toilets, friendly camping staff, no pets for me, perfect and the only negative a lot of uncontrolled child activity if you are one of those who like to go to bed early."
91100,1437886,2,ViajarEnRuta,11/08/2021,"Good campsite to visit Benidorm with correct facilities, somewhat dated but clean showers and bathrooms. I give it 2 stars because the Covid measures seemed terrible to me, a pool with a lot of capacity at some hours of the day and games queuing without a mask, if you want to think that Covid does not exist, Benihorror is the place. The center and the beach about 20/30 min. Without Covid 4 stars."

91100,967854,4,Perci,15/08/2020,The only reason we are giving it a 4 is because we thought it was a bit expensive. It is in a good location with a bunch of restaurants and a día close by. We were 3 in a sprinter van and it was 50€ with electricity. The place has a restaurant and grocery store inside the complex and the the bathrooms and showers were clean. When you pick a spot don’t try not have someone behind you because you will hear everything.

I never advise against

91100,333754,5,ikerlee,14/08/2018,"Very good camping, very well priced and all services!"
91100,311173,5,tanteAnneke,02/08/2018,"Beautiful, clean and ideal for a few days to relax and visit Benidorm. The pool is lovely and fresh bread is baked in the shop all day long. Large pitches, most with shade cloth. Sanitary is clean. Arrived on 30/7 without reservation, and 67 places free, where we could choose one ourselves. We will definitely go back!"
91108,2976876,5,buri2,17/07/2023,We spent two nights of absolute tranquility. There is a fountain and a trash can. Many possibilities for walks. The only point against it is that it is a little uneven. Better to go up coming from Orozko. A bit steep at first but no problems with AC. I would repeat.
91108,2949570,5,domiheyLA,11/07/2023,"Good place to spend a night and go for a hike or bike ride. During the week little traffic. During the night very quiet, only a few horses and maybe cows around. Notice: The acces road from the east seems to be restricted for the public despite Google navigating through it. Also it is quite steep and heavy gravel, so not ideal for big vans."
91108,2154423,5,albertulo,01/08/2022,"There are no bathrooms or garbage container. I put it because others have written that there is, but they have been confused. Amazing place."
91108,1571936,4,BrandonDeniz,12/09/2021,"An incredible place without hesitation. The night we were there (Friday) the foresters passed by on 3 occasions. They never told us anything but we waited until late to go to sleep just in case. The 2-hour climb to the Atxular eye is highly recommended, be careful on the way, little signposted. During the day of Saturday we met a lot of people on picnics and several ranchers, but all of them were very cool."
91108,1284924,5,demium,29/06/2021,Beautiful picnic area where there are several places to park. Equipped with two bathrooms for public use. Very quiet area where we could rest and be connected with nature. From there you can visit a waterfall or the Otzarreta beech forest.
91108,1156352,5,Bluesvaner,23/03/2021,Nice and quiet place. The parking area is on a slight incline. The source is ferruginous water. Be careful that it is within the Gorbea Natural Park with what it entails
91108,1081935,5,Meradlar,04/10/2020,Wonderful place to spend the night! The way up is quite steep and with the rain it slides a bit but it is worth it! We have been totally alone and the place is beautiful!
91108,1063225,5,KeyserSoze,21/09/2020,"Super calm, only ""disturbed"" in the morning by 2 cows. Tables, barbecue and a fountain !! top !!"
91108,1038914,5,Irenesarahiro,10/09/2020,"Beautiful place with good views. in the company of cows. On September 1, we and 2 motorhomes slept."
91108,1011636,5,nosesimexpliko,29/08/2020,"The way to get there is steep but paved and in very good condition. Several places to park (10 approx). Lawn area with tables, benches, fountain and for BBQ."
91108,1004749,4,perdudaaa,26/08/2020,Beautiful area to camp or spend the night. It has a fountain and many tables and benches to eat. Very calm. Access slope of about 4km very steep.
91108,1004113,5,Sofiarfer,26/08/2020,"Impressive site, absolute tranquility .... Very steep to climb but you get there well, all paved"
91108,995462,4,riftero,23/08/2020,"Perfect place, with many picnic tables, barbecues and fountain, with 10 or 12 parking spaces. Nobody bothers you, it is not a path of passage, only the shepherd who goes to see his cows and end. To access it, the concrete track is in perfect condition, although at first a bit steep."
91108,974754,4,Partnercamper,17/08/2020,"Magnificent place to spend the night away from urban centers, to put a but, being the weekend when we sleep we coincide with people doing bivouac who made some noise but nothing important. You wake up with horses next to the van."
91108,813965,4,moterillo1,01/06/2020,"Good site, the concrete track is in good condition and the slope is not very steep. The only downside, the people who keep going about everything, take out an awning, tables, chairs ... and use it as a camping site. In a short time they will ban vans and motorhomes."
91137,3056096,5,bikerboy72,01/08/2023,great for a quiet night
91137,1784792,4,HarissonFord,16/03/2022,"Water tap not working, quiet place by the water. We hear the cars pass on the road that runs alongside. Very good for a one night stopover."
91137,1653988,5,gemacalero,20/10/2021,"Perfect to spend the day, not the night. Slope site. Three walking tours. Lovely place for kids"

91137,595432,4,Mariajgg81,03/08/2019,Very quiet place! Very nice. There is little place to park but there are usually not many people seen. We are August and there were not many people.
91137,450543,4,Fritzy,07/04/2019,Has everything you need. You can hear the street a little bit. Clean toilets.
91137,364558,4,sosso55,04/09/2018,"5 places seems a little exaggerated, I would say 2 places, nice for a lunch break at noon, tables, water, barbecue."
91137,333032,3,IreneSoler,14/08/2018,Parking with inclination. complicated to find the space to put straight the van / carabana.
91152,3122474,4,raphymonoski,11/08/2023,"nice spot to admire the sunset, it was magnificent, on the other hand to sleep there is more complicated, there are generators which run all night at the level of the restaurant, too bad because the place is perfect. surely that during the high season,... So we didn't stay, we left around 10 p.m., to look for another place..."
91152,2272555,5,lenaelle,20/08/2022,Superb place to spend the night. Calm and awakening surrounded by goats. Our most beautiful night in Mallorca!
91152,2147080,4,GiulioVignati,30/07/2022,"Isolated and very quiet spot at night, when the bar is closed and very few cars pass. Cool in summer and with a beautiful view of the mountains. Poor internet / telephone reception, slight to significant slope. At night near the bar annoying noise of an engine (from the cold room?). Dirt terrain with very little dust."
91152,1981094,5,kikiya,16/06/2022,"Very well! Yes, some cars and motorcycles passed by at the last minute but it was very quiet… at 6 o'clock several cars passed by. The generator is heard at first but then nothing is heard. A different site. We were alone."
91152,1962356,5,lavaninade,09/06/2022,"Best sunset ever !! Night very quiet, we were park in front of the bar and the view with the mountains were amazing !"
91152,1837048,5,MonicaMallorca,19/04/2022,Place with spectacular views! And full of goats! It's worth spending the night!

91152,1727190,5,Campingfreek,05/01/2022,"Spent two nights here in January in the Sprinter due to the nocturnal peace and seclusion. A little busier towards sunset, then total silence. Please keep the area clean!"
91152,1670112,4,VinceetMumu,30/10/2021,Great view. Magnificent starry night. No more passage from sunset. Unfortunately the generator in the cafe went off at 7 p.m. for regular hour cycles throughout the night.
91152,1620637,5,Iris.0404,01/10/2021,"Great sunset and sunrise, every now and then a car came by, but all in all very quiet, to be recommended!"

91155,3203795,5,VladimirKorostylev,23/08/2023,"Very calm, clean campsite, large plots, BBQ"
91155,3062548,3,grisrapi,02/08/2023,Campsite with a good location as a starting point when visiting Alt Berguedà. The services it offers are ok but it needs more cleaning and more maintenance! The toilets have a constant presence of insects (warning to those who are easily frightened). The plots are mostly shaded and wide. The pool is great for summer days. You sleep very peacefully and the atmosphere is very pleasant.
91155,2928414,4,Bonbonnette,06/07/2023,"Very nice campsite. Shaded, spacious and relatively flat plot. Very calm, very clean toilets... Very good reception, speaks French, small flat the price 43€ for one night in July in van, 2 pers and electricity. We recommend."
91155,2927029,4,BenTubben,05/07/2023,"Beautiful terraced campsite with spacious pitches and up-to-date sanitary facilities. From the campsite you can make excellent walks, for example to Vallcebre (recommendation). Only very disappointing that the network connection is very bad and the wifi too."
91155,2870212,4,FelixIzquierdo,19/06/2023,"Very cozy campsite, spacious and shady pitches, very clean services. The guys at the reception are super friendly and helpful. They have a swimming pool for adults and another for children. They also have laundry service and barbecues. Ideal place to start beautiful excursions through its beautiful forests. The best, the tranquility that there is. We will definitely be back."
91155,2733981,3,SPIZA,08/05/2023,"Tiny but well-kept campsite. If it catches us on the way we would stop again, you need the vehicle if you want to go to see the places of interest near the campsite."
91155,2493216,5,Gonzale,13/11/2022,"Very nice campsite, large pitch, very clean sanitary facilities, hot water. Friendly welcome, offers bread. Network okay. we paid €23.32 per night (pitch, van, 2 people)"
91155,2397534,2,PhilippVP,23/09/2022,"We wanted to stay one night, we were offered the place right on the street, next to the watchdog. Then we drove on. But the natural environment looks very inviting."
91155,2389267,5,LienGiel0801,20/09/2022,What a wonderful helpful owner! Excellent sanitary facilities. Breathtaking view! Peace and space.

91162,2467946,5,NARUBYlife,29/10/2022,Great place to park for the day right by the beach. Wild and beautiful beach. Can't park overnight.
91162,1247384,3,sansun26,10/06/2021,"The beautiful site, but it is not accessible, they have put chains. But you can stay in the parking lot on the beach which is beautiful too"
91162,1074934,4,masoze,29/09/2020,This place is located in the nature park and there it is not allowed to stay overnight in the camper all year round! Sometimes you are lucky if you don't get caught for a few days during the autumn-winter months. We stand on the official pitch in Agua Amarga at night and drive here during the day. That's right .......... staying here would be more environmentally friendly!
91162,1060163,1,lenases,20/09/2020,"Impossible to pass chain on !!!! There are few options without a fine right now in the black ones, what a shame"
91162,1025129,1,laiafontane,04/09/2020,"It cannot be accessed, there is a chain that prevents it, the parking lot before perfect for sleeping"
91162,795963,4,berqil,16/03/2020,"I arrived yesterday because many other beaches were closed. Policia was there and raised the red flag, but said nothing to the campers. During Corona-crisis one of the last beaches I think."
91162,483492,4,angorodri,13/05/2019,"It's the place that we like the most, but lately, especially on weekends, the coastal police take a turn at sunset warning of the prohibition to park between sunset and sunrise, we do not understand that law but they send"
91162,434751,3,myothercarisaStuka,28/02/2019,They are also kicking vans off now in February.  seems like a purge all down the damn coast. i stayed 1 night though and it is lovely.

91196,2213746,3,AgustinDominguezMartin,11/08/2022,"Stop to eat, ideal with children in the park, otherwise uncomfortable, you leave the vehicle on the other side of the road, tables almost abandoned without trimming the grass... Too bad!"
91196,1216821,1,ItahisaHernandez,25/05/2021,It is not good for sleeping. It's a parking lot next to the road ... I don't even understand what makes this place marked here.
91196,910621,1,crisjaca,29/07/2020,"We did not read the comments and yes, nothing recommended."
91196,891771,1,broke100,23/07/2020,"Between the road and the train track, noisy, you have to get across occupying several places and the whole environment is very neglected. Nothing recommended or to stop en route."
91196,544254,3,nib4ac,08/07/2019,"The car parks are in line for vehicles, the motorhomes have no choice but to park transversely. In addition, parking is on the edge of a road with continuous traffic of vehicles. I do not recommend it for sleeping and if you go with children, be careful when crossing."
91207,2081533,3,nicoboss64,16/07/2022,"Quiet but not phew, it helps out"
91207,461257,1,arianeuh,20/04/2019,"For the wilderness it's missed, it's a place of wood cutting. Pebbles atmosphere and dead wood. Do not go to the point gps given you will end up on the bed of the river carpet huge pebbles, totally impractical. Better to park in the clearing on the right just before. It helps for one night, but nothing good."
91207,350946,5,fremafamily,24/08/2018,River bed which at the moment we are there is dry. The place is very calm and pleasant.

91209,766918,3,DieRoadies,10/01/2020,"In daylight we saw that there is also a driveway from the other side :-D very quiet at night, in winter you are alone here. From 9 a.m. some cars drive down the street."
91209,766683,2,DieRoadies,09/01/2020,We almost got stuck in the gravel on the rather steep driveway. Would recommend all-wheel drive or would rather not dare
