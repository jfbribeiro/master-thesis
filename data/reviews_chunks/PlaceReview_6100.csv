78268,2239027,4,123lil,14/08/2022,"Good place to spend the night. You can park next to the river or closer to the road. Even if you have the road next to it at night it is very quiet and the area is wide since the caravans can fit in battery. Good access to climbing areas. No services, no litter bins."
78268,344878,1,jphfage,20/08/2018,"Forced to park on the side of the road, no direct access to the river, damage"
78318,2907074,5,MRG10,30/06/2023,Perfect parking for one night! In the town there is a bakery and a bar. Very nice local people! You can hear the bells but they don't bother you too much.
78318,611499,4,30051962,09/08/2019,Very nice lots of places to park with big Cc. Very easy to access. Village very nice to visit including a municipal pool. I know where to stop for next time
78318,257370,2,Martori,22/05/2018,Only the hours in the field are heard but they do not bother.
78329,2633282,5,Viajandoconduna,01/04/2023,"Quiet, safe and level site. It is next to the entrance of the urbanization, so there is a 24-hour security checkpoint. When we arrived they came to have a look. We slept next to a motorhome on the asphalt area and a few meters behind another two motorhomes on the dirt area."
78329,1968273,1,FabriceFreeman,11/06/2022,There is no more 48 degree water in June!! Here is hell not to come!
78329,755524,4,mogulig,21/12/2019,"Straight ahead on the street, past the parking lots to the barrier: there asked the security guard: no problem, we are allowed to stand in the parking lot. Found a reasonably sheltered place there and slept well. It is quiet, very few cars drive along here. We also felt very safe. Thanks a lot!"
78329,405538,4,rogerlepoidevin,07/11/2018,"Had a very quiet night in early Oct. Checked with the security guard at the entrance to the island resort if it was OK to stay there, to which he said yes, fine. I would recommend always checking with him before staying. Superb views over the very low lake and towards the mountains."
78374,660131,3,Emaborsa,26/08/2019,"We stayed for the night, there is a part in the shadow and the night with less illumination. We put also a tend. The night a lot of cars and some airplains, but in the van it was ok."
78374,636577,3,denisroc,17/08/2019,"Pleasant parking but the road next door is very busy, we slept without any problem for people who have the light sleep it is worth going elsewhere .attention the car park is full of.voitures the day, but we still manage to extricate ourselves Convenient to visit Lisbon there is a bus stop (711)."
78408,3292061,5,Mcrb,13/09/2023,"Super clean, and a safe option to visit Lisbon from there, by train 35 minutes. We will repeat!!"
78408,3285582,3,titine6,11/09/2023,"I won't stay there for a week, expensive for the site. electricity, shower, draining. ccar Parke on concrete without trees."
78408,3263058,4,AnaOrtega,05/09/2023,A good campsite. In September €15.50 for an AC. To get to Lisbon 18 minutes (or bus) walk to the train and then 40 minutes to the Villa Poland station. Very comfortable and you leave the AC safely. Good bathrooms and services. Super nice staff
78408,3255886,4,Rheinfelder,04/09/2023,"Feel free to settle in this place. You feel safe and the staff is very friendly. There is hot water in the showers and the supply and disposal is also good. The place is probably currently under renovation. There are small drawbacks in the toilets/showers in general, they are a bit old. We would come again."
78408,3229475,4,susisanne64,28/08/2023,"Very good price, very quiet, a star deduction because the toilets and showers were not up to date. Otherwise everything ok"
78408,3207997,5,Brebionvincent,23/08/2023,"we really liked this campsite, it is perfect for visiting Lisbon, the toilets are very clean, the staff is very helpful and speaks French, we slept very well, the campsite is very safe, we strongly recommend it even with children. ..."
78408,3205689,5,Pierluigi71,23/08/2023,"Excellent solution to visit Lisbon. With 20 minutes by train you are in the city and leave the camper safely. The toilets and showers are clean, there are two lanes for loading and unloading and the receptionists are helpful and polite. You sleep well at night and there is also surveillance at the entrance."
78408,3122433,1,CabirolJulien,11/08/2023,"an experience not to be repeated... every night we had to move the trailer, the motorbike and finally the camping car at 27€, it was never going to work (knowing that no one had told us how to wear it). It's not a campsite that's worth it's 27€ being on an area in full sun I understand why there was no one there...."
78408,3083670,3,Cocoboheme74,05/08/2023,"The toilets and services are of high quality, the town is close but with a nice hill to climb. the price is a little high, motorhomes are parked on a disused tennis court while beautiful free shaded pitches are dedicated to caravans."
78408,3041980,2,Vanneszilla,29/07/2023,"to be taken for a motorhome area and not a campsite! in a van with 1 small tent, the van ends up on a pseudo parking lot in full sun and the tent at the other end on dirt and on a slope..."
78408,3013518,5,Poutchouc,24/07/2023,"Very good welcome, very professional. Very well kept. Very clean toilets. Toilet paper. Secure at night. Nice view of the Tagus. Pitches for large Motorhomes. Tennis and Paddle included. Possible access to the adjoining swimming pool (but paying). We spent a very good night there. 10 mins walk from Vila Franca. Can be used as a base to visit Lisbon by taking the train (1/2h). I recommend"
78408,2854388,4,gbrlam,14/06/2023,Very good campsite and very friendly agents
78408,2729350,4,lnbagal,06/05/2023,"safe and very secure campsite, maintained, clean sanitary facilities. But we are placed on an old disused site (holes, stones) and in full sun with all the CCs side by side while there are beautiful shaded places and the campsite is empty... too bad! luckily the price is reasonable. a van 2 people 12€"
78408,2727611,1,mcms1,06/05/2023,I will tell you to run away!!! We are parked in a parking lot!!!! Pitches in the shade are for caravans and Ccars in a car park in full sun!!!! While the campsite is empty!!!!!!! The photo of the Ccar in the shade is not current Now it's caravan pitches.
78408,2700390,5,AgnePet,27/04/2023,"for us this place was really good and we stayed here for one week.shady, a lot of place to play with the dog, drinking water, so you dont need to buy at supermarket, yes, facilities are not super new, but its clean and I think its the most important..Its guarded 24/7. Also they give you all information what to visit around, you get schedules of trains and buses."
78408,2691024,5,Taniablunlm,23/04/2023,"very nice place, quiet, all the facilities for motorhome and caravans, near the super and the city.  the staff is very helpful and nice people's. we whose in this place five nights."
78408,2613274,2,Laurencelefeuvre,17/03/2023,"very nice welcome but very long to register the prices do not correspond to what is sent by email!!! you can't choose your pitch even with 2 CCs in the park, we had to leave the trailer in one place and the car in another!! clean but aging sanitary facilities we will move on next time"
78408,2557169,5,DanielleBee,21/01/2023,Looked nice but closed until Feb 5th or shortly after. Friendly staff
78408,2418637,1,sonjaHerrmann,02/10/2022,"Too expensive for the bad condition of the sanitary facilities. Reception extremely slow at check-in and therefore long waiting time. You stand crooked and across a meadow with many other campers extremely close together! You are assigned a seat and you MUST accept the seat, no matter how crooked you are. I would rather stand in a parking lot than there one night!"
78408,2381405,1,LetsVanIt,18/09/2022,"15€ van +2 adults, but it is not a camping, you park on an old tennis area and there are old (i think abandoned) motorhomes and caravans parked around. Hot water in shower but moldy curtains."
78408,2357115,4,Rolwe,10/09/2022,Good morning! The place is clearly getting old. The price is now 17.30 euros for a van for 2 people and 1 dog. But for 1-2 nights it is fine. The welcome very warm. Hot water is obligatory. You can also enjoy the sunset and sunrise here in a very quiet location
78408,2298138,1,lehouille,25/08/2022,"We were changed location twice because everyone has their place, we don't mix caravan and van. The caravans have beautiful pitches in the shade but not the others (while the campsite is empty). We are told that the tent could not be with the van and we question the fact that we paid for the tent. Behind a beautiful reception, the sanitary facilities are dilapidated and the price expensive."
78408,2268389,4,TamiMannhardt,19/08/2022,"The prices are a bit dated, but not nearly as high as elsewhere. The sanitary facilities are somewhat in line with the prices, but not terrible. The location in the village is not perfect, but everything is within walking distance within 10-12 minutes."
78408,2241324,3,oelderanne,15/08/2022,"Not a nice place if you want to spend a lot of time in the camp, but very well located for a trip to Lisbon. 20 minutes by train, less than €3 each way. Motorway, train, airport are quite noisy, even at night. I didn't have any mosquitoes, the sanitary facilities were really ok. I paid €12.08 for a car, one person, with electricity. WiFi not available. I would still come back"
78408,2148873,3,kuhnybert,31/07/2022,"Mosquitoes, in the hundreds, is probably due to the irrigation of the meadow. Autobahn is audible. Sanitary amazingly good for Portugal. WiFi registration does not work with a German number. Mobile homes should be on the old tennis court, I was able to persuade the nice lady. In the evening more WoMos came, of course they parked in the forest."
78408,2094582,1,bossanova,19/07/2022,"I booked for my son, who was to arrive by plane and myself one night. the flight being canceled I asked for reimbursement. But the payment (not received) said no because I had entered the park, I would have accepted cancellation fees, but we ended up calling the police. delirious experience faced with an obtuse vision of things that is really not the image of the Portugal that I love."
78408,2092942,3,Yomismas,19/07/2022,"In the middle of the city. Very nice reception, but the place... Practically empty. Acceptable bathrooms with hot water. Just as old-fashioned as everywhere else. €10.60 van and 1 person. Does its job."
78408,2089659,1,SyFri,18/07/2022,"A very friendly waiter but no WiFi, no money back if you continue driving, shaded area only after explicit reference to the dog. Loud from the nearby road. Instead of visiting recommendations, 40-page set of rules on how I have to keep myself on the square and in the city!!!! Not recommended!!!!"
78408,1996250,3,nadben,20/06/2022,"Women's toilets very good, toilet paper Men's toilets correct Pitches good"
78408,1955407,4,TheRedLightning,07/06/2022,"If you just set you expectations towards a carpark vs a campsite, this place is decent. There’s functional toilets, showers are free and have plenty of hot water. There’s a gym and swimming pool connected to the site that you can use for a small fee (2.70€ for the gym). It’s a beautiful entrance, however the actual campsite lacks a bit in cosyness. It looks a bit worn down and the vans/campers are parked at an old tennis court. There’s also quite some old campers/tents on the place that looks like they’ve been there for forever. However, it’s quiet and friendly check in staff. Just don’t expect a super awesome campsite."
78408,1940014,1,rocketlanser,02/06/2022,"The campground is a disaster. 15€ per night, 1 camper, 2ppl, no electricity.1 of 5 toilets working, other shited or destroyed. No paper, shower destroyed. Parking lot on an abondonded tennis yard.

No money back, manager not available, no offer to look around before ckeck in."
78408,1939979,1,Jasmin_h,02/06/2022,"Unfriendly reception, wrong price list, toilets hardly usable. We stayed here to catch the train to Lisbon, a 30 minute walk to the train station and then another 30 minute drive. Have continued. Too bad you can't give 0 stars."
78408,1939973,1,camel209876,02/06/2022,"The toilets and showers are a disaster, not nearly the same as the pictures. A part of the campsite is a parking lot."
78408,1876232,2,KaSiLo,07/05/2022,"I don't even know what to say about this place. It's kinda weird here, haven't seen anything like it before. Everything very old but the showers are warm. The staff at reception are also very nice. The train connection is good, but next time I would like to live a little more centrally. Pay for 2 people and camper incl. electricity €25 for 2 nights."
78408,1857580,2,BabsundTatz,28/04/2022,"Good location for visiting the city, but the campsite is old and partly dirty. We paid €11.50 for a van with 2 people, electricity costs extra. Check-out is possible from 8 a.m. in the morning."
78408,1842904,2,Chicane22,21/04/2022,"Not easy to access, TV not possible, beautiful view, flat ground on a former tennis court, clean sanitary facilities. Well located, 20 minutes to reach the train station to visit Lisbon, very quiet."
78408,1817671,1,JensJacob,12/04/2022,"Not nice. And not practical either. A former campground on which a sports field has been converted into a Womo pitch. The highway is very audible, there are only a few electricity connections. Lots of old mobile homes and tents. Sewage and toilet disposal are also not functional. There is a washing machine but no dryer. It's a shame that Lisbon does so little for campers."
78408,1811750,3,surcouf35,09/04/2022,"Very well received at the reception by a lady speaking French. Convenient to go to Lisbon, the train station is 25 minutes away on foot, take the direction of LISBOA SANTA APOLONIA. After 35 minutes you arrive in LISBON and you can immediately visit the ALFAMA district. And for the rest, it's up to you."
78408,1808852,1,martinpats,06/04/2022,"Worthless camping, strange camping guests look more like bums, dirty campers, caravans, it seems Russia. Environment also very sad. Get out of here."
78408,1789545,1,biquet5155,20/03/2022,"Disaster. a sketch to plug in after a slalom to park. Men's toilets in ruins, women's toilets renovated, but palace drafts and low water flow. No hot water for dishes. Shanty town campsite by unpleasant year-round residents, who monitor our comings and goings and remove the hose d water inlet to prevent us from using the washing machine. To flee"
78408,1775346,3,deekhof,06/03/2022,very simple campsite. excellent reception at the reception. Access to the campsite via guarded gate. with day and night surveillance. we were on an old tennis court .. nice flat surface with a very nice view. we stayed here for 3 nights to visit Lisbon.
78408,1707089,3,Lauravenard,09/12/2021,Small municipal campsite very good to help out overnight. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Close to the motorway so convenient to the way we go down to the south or if you want to go to LISBON. The cleanliness of the sanitary block leaves much to be desired. There is a washing machine and a dryer available to all but we were unable to use it because it is constantly busy with people who live year round at the campsite.
78408,1701047,4,j9tt9,01/12/2021,"We were here to visit Lisbon. Great for that. The campsite is not particularly nice and is getting old, but everything is clean and tidy. Paid 17 € for two nights (2 people, van, electricity). To Lisbon you walk 15 minutes to the train station and then take the train for 2.25 25 minutes, even until late in the evening. Ps: Unfortunately, WiFi does not work."
78408,1677612,3,DebbyCtH,04/11/2021,We are here for one night in transit. And that's totally okay. Everything is outdated but neat. With a little more attention this could be a really nice campground. This does not seem the most ideal campsite for very long campers
78408,1633757,4,Asturianos,08/10/2021,"The receptionist very friendly with directions. Outdated facilities. The camping is municipal and the prices are cheap, we paid 8 euros for 2 people and the motorhome. Electricity costs € 1."
78408,1590160,4,Joffrik,18/09/2021,In itself a great campsite for your visit to lisbon. Sanitary facilities are outdated but are well cleaned. Train station about 25 min walk.
78408,1540510,5,kaalisan,02/09/2021,"Super cordial staff, monitored around the clock by a security guard, old but still clean sanitary facilities, friendly permanent campers. Fitness studio (€ 2.70) in the swimming pool 10m from the campsite. Good connection to Lisbon, last train leaves at 0:15."
78408,964911,2,ggjp,15/08/2020,"I just called. Contrary to what is said previously, the campsite is closed to all foreigners or not. Of course because of COVID."

78408,788462,2,anatife,29/02/2020,"I will take the few advantages and not forget the disadvantages .. I think, in addition to the evacuation of our waters. The question of price has nothing to do with it. What does not work must be repaired ... at the sanitary level ... Good, failing other choices ..."

78408,729143,3,caphilouis,24/10/2019,"Surcanned certe but the welcome is irreproachable, they take the time to explain in French all transport to and in Lisbon the sites to see and there is a cover that includes all the explanations that were provided do not seek the drain wastewater there is none, for me it corresponds to the price per night or € 7.50 per night for 2 people a cc and electricity, the washing machine is made available free of charge"
78408,722485,2,THRene,15/10/2019,Noise with the road next door and the dogs of the permanent inhabitants of the land. Warm water for showers and cold for the dishes. Used tennis court as place for campers. Not pleasant.

78408,676361,4,Samipa,04/09/2019,"A fantastic place for a multi-day visit to Lisbon, in terms of value for money! It's a simple place, but it offers everything. We paid 11 € for the Womo, two adults, two children under three years old. Per visit of Lisbon 9-, for the train for all. And showered, washed for free and recovered. The only drawback are the many dog owners who can not train their dogs so that they do not bark in a tour. Until late at night and annoying as groundless! I experience so far only in Portugal so extreme."

Washing machine available but often used so be sure you were two, with a big tent, electricity and the car for 4nights, 54th. To go to Lisbon it is good 15min of market until the railway station and 30min of train. 4.50 roundtrip / person 50centies l green card the first time. (the metro in Lisbon 1.50). The municipal pool is 2.25 / person for 2 hours. Plan on short shorts for men, a one-piece swimsuit for women, as well as a hat and flip-flops. Regarding nights, plan mosquito shelter or mosquito nets parxe that is damn attack. And if possible settle in the back, behind the trees, and not with the view of the river, which incidentally gives on the highway that must be said is extremely noisy. A dog from neighboring houses is having fun too in the morning. Or invest in earplugs. So there are some disadvantages but the campsite is a great address and very welcoming employees"

78450,1122018,4,karl07,18/12/2020,"Large space for several vans. Very good lake views, sunny and easy access."
78450,1030204,4,terrorhead69,06/09/2020,Very quiet but next to the road. coverage and swamp water within seconds
78450,629358,2,Namustrus,15/08/2019,"The site is beautiful, the only bad thing is that it is next to a road and cars pass very fast. Around 2:00, 3 cars arrived to set up tents apart from cars that come to skid and disturb. Around 7:00 a car came screaming and skidding like crazy, only to wake up the vans that were there. I don't think we'll come back ..."
78450,595034,3,vedyo,03/08/2019,The place is spacious and with the lake next to it. The only drawbacks are that it is next to the road and that there is not a shadow.
78450,533634,5,Laietta,30/06/2019,"A highly recommended site with this heat, many places to refresh humans and animals! From Saturday to Sunday less traffic."
78450,328333,4,JJunior,12/08/2018,"Good place to spend the night by the lake, we stayed one night next to another motorhome. Esplanade of record with a lot of site and easy access to the lake. A bit of noise from vehicles in the early morning when having the road right next to you."
78450,272895,4,lasarastark,22/06/2018,"Nice and comfortable place to spend the night, without services. Very spacious. The only downside is that there is a lot of traffic on the road from early in the morning and it is quite audible if you have to have it open."
78463,2757866,3,stfandso,17/05/2023,"Just by the side of the road (not very busy). We continued on the path to get away from the road (be careful, no possibility of turning around, we started back in reverse once last night)."

78490,3208020,2,Giuseppe64camperista,23/08/2023,"Nice staff, sufficient restaurant. Full of permanent campers and few tourists. Shameful toilets. Sea within walking distance. It's fine for a stopover"
78490,3156112,1,Xisco12,15/08/2023,"I will not return to this place. First they tell me that we can stay later than the check-out time (12:00) and when I go to pay in the afternoon the nice gentleman tells me that he charges me one more night for being later than 12:00, that this is like hotels. I have felt cheated, ripped off, and sorely disappointed in this place."
78490,2965150,4,Nanorran,14/07/2023,"Good campsite to spend a few days. Services in perfect condition. Friendly owners and price according to what they offer. I mean, it can be repeated."
78490,2944772,5,FamilleRossi,10/07/2023,"We're so glad we found this place !
Large space with shade, trees everywhere. 
Family camping, very nice staff. 
Playground for kids, a bar, restaurant, mini market on site, everything you need.
No swimmig pool but a direct access to a unique, natural beach.
Quiet and clean. Highly recommended."
78490,2941585,2,bertialdo,09/07/2023,the site is unobtrusive and very dusty.we asked to stay until evening but with the campsite 50/100 busy we were asked for the full rate.....
78490,2897994,5,dolores53,27/06/2023,very pleasant campsite all the services for motorhomes on the side of the entrance to the campsite beautiful beach at the end of the campsite chemical toilets also in the campsite plot with clean sanitary shade cloth The owner speaks French we paid 30 euros for a cc and 2 people and electricity does not take the Acsi card
78490,2846506,5,luiscamper,12/06/2023,"Small, quiet campsite, with the basics, lots of shade, very clean bathrooms, friendly staff, there are pitches of various sizes"
78490,2706643,1,mr.benji,29/04/2023,"It was closed in May, today on April 29th. however, we cannot say more. didn't make a nice impression from the outside hopefully closed for renovation"
78490,2410429,4,Barnsprto,28/09/2022,Campsite not very beautiful in appearance but it is at the foot of a superb beach you have to stop there for at least one night to enjoy a walk on the beach the next day. The manager speaks French and the toilets are very clean.
78490,2350308,1,loddaallemann,07/09/2022,0 stars ! Pitches narrow and covered with tire killer curbs. Washed out topsoil and EVERYTHING dusty and dirty. Plumbing stinks just like they say. Senior unfriendly and ridiculously expensive 39.50 a night with electricity.
78490,2279643,1,park4nightDaida,21/08/2022,"Dirty!!! the plots were a disaster, the bathrooms were very dirty and smelled terrible, the truth is that I will not return."
78490,2177106,3,Sebsassy,05/08/2022,"Perfect place for those who don't want to stay in a big impersonal campsite, we stayed here for 3 nights with our campervan and paid €100 without electricity."
78490,2155788,3,Robeli,01/08/2022,"Very nice treatment. Very small plots. There are hot water showers and others with cold water. There is no possibility of regulating them. There is not much order with the cars, people park where they want. price quite good"
78490,2089943,4,thecaddycarlcrew,18/07/2022,"Very nice campsite with direct access to the beach. Within walking distance is also the place where you can go shopping and eat. Sanitary facilities were fine, but they and our little camper were plagued by ants."
78490,2040144,4,BerndRudde,05/07/2022,"Completely OK! New, good sanitary facilities, the rest is a completely normal campsite, no more, no less. The beach is directly accessible, and everyone should decide for themselves whether they like the place. We didn't like it, but it was okay for transit."
78490,1928115,1,Alainlevan,29/05/2022,Camping that is seedy. Just opposite an abandoned house squatted by more than dubious people. We turned around.
78490,1919814,4,miasehler,27/05/2022,"Located right next to the mile-long beach, very nice. Newly renovated toilets and showers, clean and fresh. Small restaurant and small shop. we paid 30 euros / night / 2 pers. Recommended!"
78490,1905186,5,sagrariojlc,21/05/2022,"Good camping and very familiar. Clean both bathrooms and all services. Very friendly all the staff. We were in the month of May, super quiet to relax."
78490,1800940,3,DoubleDiamonds,30/03/2022,Arrived to be told this site is closed until May!
78490,1727992,4,Aliens,06/01/2022,"Camping both for Camper but also with Bungalow, very nice. Present all the services but would need more bathrooms, because those present are together with the showers, and if one is taking a shower, you have to wait to go to the bathroom. We spent two nights there and we enjoyed it very much. Nearby there are nice restaurants where you can eat well, and other services. Recommended."
78490,1667633,3,vanhomi,29/10/2021,The green campsite is between the road and the sea. He has direct access to the beach at the end of the square. The partially covered plots are not separated from each other and are of different sizes. The subsurface is natural. The sanitary facilities are ok. We didn't stay here because the place seemed neglected to us.
78490,1614462,2,IrisBelle,28/09/2021,"The places are sometimes way too small, I couldn't even get in with my VWT4. You stand under a cloth against the sun, but that also means that your solar panel does nothing. In addition, my bus was full of ants for days and I also heard this from the neighbors. You are also pretty close to the sea."
78490,1587336,5,hrunehru,17/09/2021,"Clean, nice and close to the beach. One of the best campsites in Spain"
78490,1577101,5,IsabelGavira,14/09/2021,"Very happy! a campsite with direct access to the beach. Beautiful beach of fine sand with dunes, long and wide. amazing sea water. few mosquitoes. plot size very well. shadow. the campsite is clean and well maintained. the bar has good food. the toilets are clean. in the supermarket there is fresh bread in the morning. we will be back for sure!"
78490,1565206,4,lulu_malaga,10/09/2021,"We spent two nights there. Typical camping, quite clean and very quiet and familiar. Close to a good beach. Good service and good prices in restaurant and shop. good prices in September and specials. we had a very nice time there. quite shady. few men's bathrooms. definitely recommended overall! Thank you :)"
78490,1447972,3,Chema-ar84,13/08/2021,"Old but clean facilities, very good situation if you want to enjoy the beach, there is a walkway that leads directly, it remains that the plots are small and we were invaded by ants."
78490,1439343,2,lotail,11/08/2021,"A little on top of each other clean sanitary, pay attention to the price (one night two people with electricity 36.50 €) he speaks French very well at the reception"
78490,1437584,3,FONT84,11/08/2021,"Very nice owner, clean sanitary. With direct access to the sea, which is really very convenient. On the other hand, ant invasion and we think of sand flea because full of small red buttons on the body. We paid 50 € / night for 3 adults and 1 child with electricity, a bit expensive for my taste considering the services of the campsite."
78490,1279907,3,tmorcilloj,27/06/2021,"Very good location, right on the beach. The toilets very good, new. The small plots, and with beach sand, you have to be careful not to put it in the motorhome. One night two adults and the car 31 euros, a bit expensive for the services it offers. Light is included in that price. The bad thing for us is that you don't have the facility to visit anything, we don't bring bikes, and the campsite is in the middle of nowhere. The access road is a shabby dirt road, and you see even a busy shack, cause a little respect. In any case the beach is worth it."
78490,1240773,5,thetonioproject,06/06/2021,Perfect 20 € / night at the moment :) very clean and personal nice
78490,1196782,5,MaligaTourBelgique,14/05/2021,"Really top camping! Shaded pitches, direct access to the beach, very clean sanitary facilities, close to the city! Very nice owner! We highly recommend!"

78490,1003881,2,elaindonan,26/08/2020,"Most of the pitches are sandy. The beach pitches area is too small for motorhomes over 7m, there are some large pitches but you can hardly maneuver. In the showers you cannot regulate the temperature of the water, in fact it was cold. Too expensive to spend a night 5 people and a motorhome, € 58. Very comfortable to go to the beach."
78490,992992,5,s.orias,22/08/2020,"Peaceful camping. Very friendly staff, large pitches for motorhomes. shade the pitches and the facilities although old quite good."

78490,473348,4,aro31,02/05/2019,Sanitary very clean. Playful air for kids. Well protected by tarpaulins in mid-season so even nice at night. Beach access directly from the campsite.

78508,2480497,3,rachaelmharri,03/11/2022,Not a picturesque spot but very quiet. All we could hear was the sound of the sea.  A bit of movement around 8am but just people working.
78508,1539142,2,AaronT,02/09/2021,"It is very close to the port. Industrial estate, a lot of noise from 5 in the morning."
78508,1523552,4,lormarnidito,28/08/2021,"Very large parking lot with a lot of space next to the sea. Perfect if you arrive late to the port to sleep, it is a few km away. We walked downtown to have dinner and the next day to visit it."
78508,1397027,2,Master29,03/08/2021,Quiet and flat ideal for catching the ferry in the morning or staying overnight if the ferry arrives at night
78508,786565,3,jppaint,25/02/2020,"Self-service parking 10 'walk from the historic center. It is clean, with the locations marked on the floor. It is true that it is not a beautiful seaside, but it is reserved for us and checked by the police several times a day."
78508,384549,1,negrodelwasap,29/09/2018,"An inhospitable place, deplorable and without a doubt the worst thing that exists on the island. Not recommended."
78510,2575279,2,SimonSarahSumo,12/02/2023,"Probably fine to stay but we didn't like it and moved on to the monastery at Santa Ana. Very public and noisy, not for us."
78510,2558255,4,Lauravd,22/01/2023,"We slept on Saturday night and we were calm, I imagine that since it was Saturday the city council vehicles did not go out or come in, the center is close"

78510,2449374,4,CandGVanlife,17/10/2022,Plenty of spaces. Not quiet on a Friday night but no problems. Good access to town. OK for a night.
78510,1802437,5,Maetthy,31/03/2022,Simple place to stay in a large car park (buses and cars). We spent a quiet night here in March.
78510,1757998,4,bikebabe,17/02/2022,"Spent a quiet night here, no refuse lorries but it was a Sunday morning. There is also a Civil Guard office alongside, which made it feel more secure, saw several Civil Guard cars coming in and out. Three coaches also arrived and parked overnight. I'd stay here again."
78510,1700265,3,javolo65,29/11/2021,"It is a parking lot, no more. Shared with the other cars. To visit the city very good. Opposite there is a municipal vehicle depot, so I suppose it will increase the noise from the parking itself."
78510,1182010,2,NOC,30/04/2021,Very good to visit the city but to spend the night too noise.We were on Wednesday and at dawn buses also start to leave next to alado the cleaning vehicles are collected etc.
78510,258016,3,pexatino,23/05/2018,"Bitumen parking, good for visiting the city, quiet at night, wine merchants nearby"
78519,3278730,1,sofi70,09/09/2023,"I put one star because it is not possible to put less, the site is not maintained at all at this point it is making fun of travelers, the reception was empty when we arrived, the people present did not say hello and pretend we weren't there, the swimming pool: pfff, we fled before discovering the showers. But we saw the neighbor's mandarin orchards...!!!"
78519,3248894,5,rayez,02/09/2023,"Great, calm, and friendly camping space. Recommend for its alternative feel! Toilets & bathrooms are OK."

78519,3230339,5,eddyaudrey,28/08/2023,"Perfect place where there is everything for the van and the motorhomes as well as the caravans, People from the very welcoming association, speak French, we will not hesitate to come back because the place is very reassuring. Settled between the clementine trees, we were fine"
78519,3200990,5,barougier,22/08/2023,"Very quiet and pleasant place, with swimming pool, hot shower, real pitches, water and electricity close to each of them. Plus a string of games for children. In short, all the comfort of a real campsite, but much quieter. Our only regret is not having had more contact with the people behind this project. We would have liked to know more."
78519,3200828,4,flym,22/08/2023,"Atypical place managed by an association. The spaces are generous. Hot showers and toilets, swimming pool, barbecue available. Simple and pleasant place where we spent 2 nights."

78519,3131977,4,crotocs33,12/08/2023,"Surprising hippie place at first glance. But toilets, showers ok, electricity and water on each site and even a swimming pool! Could use a bit more amenities but otherwise cool."
78519,3118132,4,lauraargemi,10/08/2023,It is an association that costs €5 to sign up and you have all the services. It was good for us to be able to shower. We have not spent any night but it seems quiet.
78519,2726503,1,IrisRupp,05/05/2023,"Friendly welcome. The thistles are a plague. On the recommendation of the operator, the water should not be drunk, i.e. not in the water tank. If you like chicken poop on your mat in the morning... Conversation only possible in French."
78519,2720884,5,Juli77D,03/05/2023,"Very nice, large places under orange trees, 2 showers and a somewhat unusual toilet, which we found great. Very nice, helpful people. Here you can relax and enjoy peace and quiet."

It's basic but clean! At four, we paid 8€ + 5€ to join the association (valid for 1 month). We enjoyed the location between the orange trees."
78519,2630635,5,lolo1989,30/03/2023,We unfortunately closed for a week because the pit let us down. Problem solved and we are waiting for you

And when we arrived there, it was closed, with just a message on the fence explaining that it was closed for construction. It would be nice to put a note of information on the answering machine to avoid us moving around unnecessarily."
78519,2600706,5,claudi2000,06/03/2023,"If you are looking for a quiet, spacious place away from the crowded campsites, this is the place for you. A large orange grove about 10 minutes by bike from Fuseta and Moncarapacho invites you to relax. Sanitary system in order, disposal as well."
78519,2600686,4,Relax2000,06/03/2023,"Peaceful, spacious pitch. The operators (mainly French) are friendly and helpful and go about their business during the day. Unfortunately, there is only one common toilet and 2 showers for men and women. Washing clothes for 3 € possible. Everything very simple but clean. Anyone who can handle that is in good hands here."
78519,2587143,4,ChrisRabe,22/02/2023,"Easily accessible, green idyll near the town and the beach, shower/toilet clean. Various non-natural sources of noise: cars, scooters, nearby roads, agricultural machinery, construction work by residents, occasional music. Leash obligation for guest dogs. 7.5 t I advise against this place, peace seekers at the moment too. Otherwise peaceful, relaxed atmosphere, mostly French."

78519,2485968,2,cornedita,07/11/2022,"A place 15 minutes by bike to Fuseta. A friendly welcome on a natural site. Parking space with a view of community life with various trailers. 3 points deduction for dog shit, which is spread over the square and unfortunately also on the paths. Sanitary very simple but clean. Attractively priced."
78519,2451646,3,Billy87,19/10/2022,"Had a nice stay. Felt very safe here as a young woman traveling alone. Very nice, relaxed hospitable people who live here. However, the sanitary facilities are neglected and not really clean. Super nice all the animals but you have to be careful not to stand in the chicken shit, not really pleasant."
78519,2414094,5,nzgoddess,30/09/2022,There is no smell and the pool is clean and a wonderful way to cool off. A very nice group of French people live here and gave us a warm welcome.

78519,2404271,1,T5ViNi,26/09/2022,"We arrived and left straight away. The reception was nice and the lady showed us everything. However, the smell in this place was unbearable for us, which is why we drove back after 5 minutes (although we had already paid). 8min away is a campsite which was cleaner and tidier and priced even cheaper. We would not recommend this place!"
78519,2340328,5,AnaBanana,05/09/2022,"We feel safe in this small very ""Roots"" campsite. There are still real toilets, as well as very clean and comfortable showers. Good surprise for the very reasonable price. Animals (cats, dogs, chickens) circulate freely so if that bothers you this is not for you. A few mosquitoes but very reasonable."
78519,2273605,5,AchimMenzel,20/08/2022,"We really enjoyed the small paradise with many animals and permanent guests! Please keep in mind that this is NOT a campsite. For an unbeatable price, we were allowed to visit a community in which cleanliness is taken care of on our own responsibility! Before you drive onto the site, announce yourself at the gate (bell/telephone)."
78519,2254418,4,JJ55,17/08/2022,"No campsite! Accordingly, it is also created: two showers, a toilet and the possibility to do laundry (3 €). It's like a little hippie village. We felt very comfortable between cats, dogs and chickens. Were able to buy 6 eggs for €2."

78519,2046235,5,huntlosen,07/07/2022,"The place is a very good alternative to the very crowded and noisy campsite in Fuseta. It is quiet, has a lot of space and is run by very nice people who live here as a club. Very good drinking water without chlorine, a nice little pool, unfortunately only one toilet, but everything was very clean. They helped us with everything we needed, even fixed our fridge"
78519,1921050,5,samsarabim,27/05/2022,"A beautiful place! Membership fee for the association is valid for one month. Showers, toilets (everything simple but clean), water, electricity etc. in the price per night including standing room under the orange trees, you wake up like in paradise. Complimentary veggies from the community garden, eggs, made us feel very welcome. If you are tired of overcrowded tourist campsites: this is the perfect place."
78519,1901370,1,dermanuel089,19/05/2022,"We went because of the good reviews. What we found was an unkempt and neglected place. There is one (1) physical loo and two showers. Residents do the cleaning themselves. Cost €5 Membership fee €8 per night/van. Compared to ""normal"" places overpriced for zero performance. Everything on our pitch was full of Hünerkacke, so we fled."
78519,1896297,5,LinaScherz,17/05/2022,"What an oasis! We were able to switch off for 2 days surrounded by nature and relax in the beautiful pool. In our own vegetable garden we could harvest our own lettuce and buy eggs from the chickens (6pcs=2€). The place is pure idyll, super quiet and the people incredibly nice and relaxed. Paid €8/night with our van and €5 club fee. Washing costs 3 €, clothes lines available."
78519,1869378,5,iriskeim,04/05/2022,"Five stars - unfortunately no more! Wanted to stay 1 night, there were 3. Quiet place, dear people, an oasis! If we didn't want to see more we would have stayed!"
78519,1854073,5,nyyls,26/04/2022,"No problems to reach with a normal Van.
We really liked the place and the people there. It has a nice community spirit and the chicken roaming around really made this place in nature feel good to be at. Shower is nice, spacious and hot, just check if someone is washing dishes before you go (same heater).
Would definitely come again."
78519,1837636,3,MecdOPO,19/04/2022,Nice place and warm welcome. But then be careful access at the end of a very narrow path for motorhomes rather area reserved for those who wish to land at least 1 week otherwise hassle to enter and exit each time
78519,1812568,5,parkmann,09/04/2022,"Great, cozy place in the middle of orange trees. Equipment is simple, but very clean and everything works well. We paid 21€ for 2 nights with our T5 Van incl. electricity and warm shower. We had sufficient space and everyone was so nice. Also there is a nice, alternative bar. We‘ll be back for sure!"
78519,1794517,5,cigogne7,25/03/2022,"hello, I inform you that given the current crisis and the rising prices we are forced to increase the services so small 5 plus 3 and large 10 plus 3 and we apologize for this inconvenience cegonha7"
78519,1760957,5,Hendriekje,20/02/2022,3A great place. You either feel at home or you don't. There is no middle ground. A relaxed atmosphere between the mandarin trees. Live and let live. You become a member of the association for 5 euros per month for 2 people. Spending the night costs 7 all in or 12 if you really need a lot of space. This is right for us
78519,1747395,3,crigbee1,04/02/2022,This campsite is expensive for what it is compared to other places. We only satiated one night which worked out at 17 euros for one night. The space was a reasonable size. It is a comfortable walk into Fuseta. Didn’t use the facilities so cannot comment on those. Very tight entry lane make sure your wing mirrors are pushed in.
78519,1747279,4,marysecassarino,04/02/2022,"Very nice land in the middle of an orange grove. We spent a week there. Spacious pitch with 10A electricity, gray water drain, water. Showers and washbasin are spartan, but that doesn't matter much in view of the friendliness of the place. The new manager is very nice and Pat is always there to help. We will be happy to come back for a third time."
78519,1701977,5,ylang-ylang,02/12/2021,"If there is a place where the traveler / nomad can rest, it is in the middle of the orange grove. It is an agricultural land laid out in a friendly manner. The concept is nice in order to create mutual aid links between travelers. Participating in the association is also getting involved. We liked the calm, the ambient kindness. And especially the people there, characters with a big heart."
78519,1684122,2,lepareurPatrice,10/11/2021,"Place run by a president of this association who takes advantage of collecting 12 € per day with electricity, water and emptying on site. to go to the showers zippered door very hard to open ...! Spartan crockery area held on pallets. to have a drain pipe in our place you do your best to repack several ends. happy that there are members who welcome and clean ....!"
78519,1635768,3,janfe,09/10/2021,"It is not a farm but an agricultural land developed by a French. The boss is an association all by himself, no credit card of course. there are lots of places at 7 euros but you have to aim, otherwise bingo! it's 10.12 or 15 € plus membership in the association ... we are at 20 €. there is indeed a toilet and 2 DIY showers (hot water, non-adjustable ice water)."
78519,1632823,4,AdiRapaport,08/10/2021,"We loved the place and stayed longer then planned. friendly people, very quiet and basic facilities. the pool was great for the kids."

78519,1455260,5,Kanou64,14/08/2021,"Very nice, peaceful place with adequate amenities. You have to join the association to be able to stay there, but for a small fee. In addition, the association has a cantina which offers excellent local meals!"
78519,1404524,5,marietpaulo,04/08/2021,"Great place, peaceful. We stayed there for 2 nights, and left with a bit of a heavy heart.

78519,1343291,5,geeois,20/07/2021,"Little piece of heaven! Each van has its own small plot delimited by orange trees and other vegetables that serve the community. You can borrow the bikes, take a dip in the swimming pool or taste the owner's local cuisine. IN SHORT, a mandatory step !!!"
78519,1187326,5,Kutter2,07/05/2021,Pleasant atmosphere that's why we stayed longer than planned. French management. The larger plots are shaded by orange trees and have electricity and water connections.
78519,1142999,5,lolo1989,26/02/2021,"We have been at the camp for a few months and to respond to previous messages, it is true that there were some concerns this winter but which are all resolved today. This person took advantage of the association (loan of the garage, tools, help with car insurance, etc.) without any thanks. For us little paradise on earth"
78519,1137584,1,Ancely,15/02/2021,"Wifi failure for 15 days. Always the presence of rats (side henhouse). The best part is the relationship that has been very strained with the Boss who, depending on his mood, sends you shit. We also witnessed a public feud with a member who was kicked out of the field. It's over, we won't come back to it. As a reminder: Membership 50 € / year, 7 € or 12 € / day in cash, without invoice."
78519,1137582,1,Ancely,15/02/2021,"We stayed at the end of December 2020 We have known this land for 3 years. But this time it was catastrophic from every point of view. For the price, we do not find it anymore. The installations are just DIY that lasts. Problem with the shower not working when the toilet flush is used. Pierced toilet drain pipe flowing onto the main aisle."
78519,1101264,2,AmaniMichael,21/10/2020,"We arrived in heavy rain with empty reception,no water, no electricity but we had to pay full amount. People were friendly but we didn't feel welcome and wont come back."

78519,1086291,1,Störti01,08/10/2020,The reception was nice. You cannot use both showers at the same time because one of them has cold water. Toilets are plum toilets or dry toilets.
78519,1067601,5,aeny,24/09/2020,"The place is just beautiful. We only wanted to stay one night, but we feel so comfortable here that we stayed 4 nights. The surroundings are not exactly great, but still ... the beach is not far away and you can just relax on the square. Total recommendation !!"
78519,1046906,5,MarinaKl,13/09/2020,"A wonderful place, enough shade, a relaxed atmosphere and even a small pool. All sanitary facilities are kept simple but clean and have received immediate help because I had a small damage to the bus. Bicycles included, washing machine € 3 for one hour"

78519,963875,5,danielsky,14/08/2020,Really nice rustic campsite. Friendly and relaxed ppl who runs it. Not busy at all which makes it ideal to enjoy quite time. Pool is big enough and there are all other facilities available including hot showers and swings for kids. It’s great alternative to busy and crowded campsite like the one in Fuseta.
78519,962140,4,juliebritneytiti,14/08/2020,"Really great. I would have loved to stay there longer. Roots and simple, calm (unless you sit next to the hens) and pleasant.

78519,710429,2,AVengaAltay,01/10/2019,I do not understand the enthusiasm of people.  There is 1 toilet for the entire campsite.  There is enough hot water for 2 people.  The rest are washed with cold water.  The pool is a faded swamp :(. Only the price of 12 € somehow saves the situation.

78519,697790,4,lenny67,20/09/2019,Have spent a few nights here and will stay at least 5 more. it's small beautiful area in the middle of farmers land. the inflight to Faro's airport are straight above your head but nothing that disturb if you are not very sensitive. The road are not so far away so you can hear the traffic but also that no problem if you are not very sensitive. Toilet and shower are very clean and fresh.Love it❤️
78519,685287,5,JuMaHa,10/09/2019,"A quiet place, which is run by a club very informal. On site there is next to a normal (very clean) toilet with flushing and two toilets without flushing (outhouse).

Wake up to the rooster crowing around the trucks. Too bad, we could not have access to the pool which was green. By cons, we were lunch at the ""cantina"" restaurant of the same association offering good products and it was a delight and cheap. (reservation required of the meal the day before)"

78519,495130,4,Valentin60,28/05/2019,Place at the top. We wanted to have a quiet day and a night rest and we found all that in this place. Warm welcome and all smiles. A land where it is good to have a drink and even a pool to cool off. And in addition you can buy good fresh eggs. I highly recommend.
78519,494488,5,Benjamin.Henry,27/05/2019,"Pleasant discovery in a place full of serenity, good mood. An excellent welcome, very clean place and very well laid out in adequacy with the environment.

78519,426634,1,louf31,04/02/2019,"10 minutes from the beach .... yes with a car, the same for the shops. In short, a field summarily landscaped in the middle of an orange grove at the end of life. The Algarve is transformed more and more into parking operated by ex sixty eightards wanting to maximize profit.On love or not."
78519,393675,5,Bougy56,15/10/2018,We had an unforgettable week on this site. We come several times a year in Algarve and this address will be a must step. Patrick and Pilou know how to receive the members and the formula they propose makes you feel at home. Hurry the next visit!
78519,393181,5,Philbarca,14/10/2018,At this moment we are here is the top! On the other hand the owners are not Eric and Corinne but Patrick and pilou adorable people. Do not hesitate it's great

78519,383773,5,flodel,28/09/2018,"What else to say that tranquility is at the end of this path. This association puts at your disposal a car to do your shopping. While showers and toilets are spartan but are clean. A pool for cooling that is well maintained. The owner is a Breton who is very kind and friendly. We also thank Eric and Corine who welcomed us before the arrival of the owner. If you are looking for luxury for 6,50 € location and 2 people with electricity go your way and do not criticize it the advantage of existing. In addition you can make a washing machine for 2 €. Membership is € 5 whether you stay 1 or 15 days. We stayed 8 days. We will come back for sure."
78519,381103,3,RuthPaulandMavis,24/09/2018,"We stayed for one night on 16 Sept. Lovely site, but I was expecting better things having read all the previous rave reviews. It’s a very pleasant place but the shade wasn’t enough to keep the van cool in the September sun. We also found it difficult because the grounds were covered in thorns which made their way into the van and then into our feet! Not the fault of the owners, but didn’t make a comfortable stay. That said, for the price it is perfectly acceptable and the added luxury of a small, clean and well maintained pool was a real treat for such a cheap stop over."

78519,365110,5,gmil78,05/09/2018,Friendly welcome and very natural setting for this campsite where we spent a quiet and relaxing night under the orange trees. The operation in association is original and offers interesting services for long stays. Functional but atypical equipment. Very attractive rates.
78519,364680,5,MichelLily,04/09/2018,"Only positive! We had planned to stay 2 nights, we will stay 2 weeks.

We stayed there only one night. Maniacs go your way the terrain is very dusty. Beware that the area is not too victim of its success there was a lot of French this weekend, almost a little too much for us looking for a quiet secluded corner."

As you have probably already read on previous comments this place is beautiful and in addition it is orchestrated by a hand master by Patrick (the president of the association) and his wife Pilou. 2 people who welcome you as at home? after a brief explanation of the association (5 € compulsory membership), here we are on our location under the orange trees (5 € location 1,5 € water + electricity). Our neighbors are camping-caravans, caravans (pay attention to large size path is quite tight) ... you have at your disposal 2 showers with hot and cold water, a toilet, a corner for the dishes, a machine to wash, a pool very well maintained and a wonderful Portuguese canteen (typical, traditional and so welcoming!) held by members of the association (a few kilometers).

Difficult access: we hardly reached the spot with a VW California not 4x4. Aldough the place was amazing, we won’t try to get there again as it was too difficult."
78556,490253,4,AlexVanLifersT3,22/05/2019,"Place ""quiet"" during the week, it is a port with many curves and you have to be careful if you see buses since the road is narrow they can block you and crash, once you get to the road in our case we clean the land from heavy stones and We ride with all terrain tires, if you go by car or van and you have no experience on the way you may not climb as the road has gravel and loses some traction, at night you hear some boat engines and in the mornings some motorbikes Route. If you follow the path, the road continues to climb although the track is even worse but it is more isolated from noise."

Going further and taking the right at the split I progressed about a km then had to turn back because it was too much for my little Berlingo."
78556,427988,3,pordini,10/02/2019,"Okay spot but quite sloped and very, very close to the road. Sunday morning motorcyclists  making this a less than ideal place. Good for a coffee break."

This spot is beautiful and there are multiple vans. I had an okay night, but unfortunately a very uncomfortable morning (hopefully a one-off). Is this a pick-up place?

Recommendable!"

78592,1375319,5,AleMagaCat,28/07/2021,We had a quiet weekday night in July. The music from the chiringuito does not bother and at night few people pass. There is no price to wake up to the sound of the waves. The chiringuito bathrooms open at 10am

78601,2355085,5,francifu,09/09/2022,A quiet and peaceful place. the wind can be strong and raise red earth but the peace is incredible! ideal for a peaceful night. Bumpy road but viable even without a 4x4. to be avoided on days of abnormal wind.
78601,2060546,2,KimberlyEngels,11/07/2022,The place is a bit scary especially at night. The drive to the place is very hard and not good for big vans or campers. Close to the sea and the pools are easily accessible. But a no no for me to sleep

78601,1122834,5,PercyR,21/12/2020,Super great place to sleep even for several days. A little spooky at night next to the abandoned hotel but the natural pools down by the water all make up for it. You can swim there if the waves are not too high. But watch out for the sea urchins when bathing!
78601,1118748,4,Hestiacampervan,01/12/2020,"Incredible and privileged place. Access is somewhat complicated, recommended 4x4, if not, with another vehicle you can gradually get there. Follow the path of the gps in satellite view, since the proposed route is confusing and we have had to turn around and come by another way. I recommend going around the Montaña Roja urbanization side. We have been alone, there is a giant esplanade with incredible views, watch out for the wind. Being next to the abandoned hotel is very exciting. We have not gone down to the charcones because it was very windy and rough, but it has easy access to bathe on a good day. Very quiet place to disconnect."

78623,518249,5,RubenCerler,17/06/2019,"It is not a place to spend the night. There is a shop to buy groceries, wash the motorhome and fill and empty tanks. ""alberhd"" is not a place to spend the night;) It is not fair the qualification you give it, as it leads to confusion. It is a totally safe place during the opening hours of the station, but it has no space prepared for the night. Perfect to refuel and continue travel."
78623,518154,1,alberhd,16/06/2019,"Insecure, not advisable, history of attempted robbery at the gas station, there are no cameras where caravans are parked, in this area opt for camping for safety"

78652,412285,1,Gillies,06/12/2018,It didn’t feel right stopping here. We we greeted my multiple locals with very strange and uninviting looks. The olive trees have rubbish and empty beer bottles everywhere around them - felt like we were on someone’s property. Judge for yourself but we would recommend just heading on to the next stop.

78803,1142905,3,rvanvugt,26/02/2021,"Due to the small, steep and eroded gravelroad down to this spot, it is only suitable for vans in the size of a VW Bus. Any bigger vehicle will have problems getting here. Mine is such bigger campervan, so I did not drive down the road. The spot as such is lovely with great views over the lake, for a day trip nice but for an overnight stay not my choice."
78803,1136000,5,JesseK,08/02/2021,"Amazing spot! Barely people, and a beautiful view of the lake. Still a clean location, let's keep it that way! :)"

You can find a way more beautiful spot following the path down not on the map at this point, but advanced driving skills and maybe a 4x4 is required."
78803,698411,4,DiscoBalls,20/09/2019,"Lovely place, no access to the beach with vehicles as the recent flooding has opened up cracks in the path... i didn't fancy driving over it anyway...."
78803,392033,5,Eulenspiegel,12/10/2018,Very nice place directly at the boarder of the lake. We drive the stony lane until it's end. There is a second spot with incredible panorama view.  There is a little bit more distance to the restaurant at the end of the asphalt road. The only disadvantage: a lot of flys. Spent 2 relaxed days. Thank you Park4Night!
78803,371356,4,Mikedaisy,12/09/2018,There is parking at the restaurant carpark without any problems. No need for a 4x4 as there is a tarmac road from the main road to the restaurant larger enough for big RVs. Remember to fish in andalucia you do need a license heavy fine if you don't have one.
78814,2831459,5,ebbi1012,08/06/2023,"We were directly opposite on a large gravel lot, which is separated from the road by a small wall. We were there with children, there are 2 nice playgrounds in the village, which can be reached in 3 minutes on foot."
78814,2813266,5,mariaundjens,02/06/2023,A very nice and quiet parking lot (in the evening and at night). On May 26th we were all alone here on the gravel square in a quiet and level corner. There are also good and level asphalt pitches along the road. The place was ideal for our evening visit to the monastery. The monastery closes at 7 p.m. Santa Cruz de la Seros is a very pretty little town and well worth a visit.
78814,2769466,4,laspescadillasviajeras,20/05/2023,Right in front there is another parking lot that is much more level. The town is small but very charming. It is a good alternative to not staying in the car park above that is prohibited. There are fountains in the village and containers nearby.

78906,687369,3,northernraider,12/09/2019,Nice spot for peace and quiet. like everyone else I'm the only van here
78906,582489,4,lvalente,29/07/2019,"I do not give 5 stars because it has no services .. ideal place for climbing, Ferrata, btt, canoeing and hiking ..."
78906,517723,4,theroverlanders,16/06/2019,"Great spot, as per the other reviews we were there by ourselves. My partner used the showers but they were cold. Barely saw another person the whole time we were there, peaceful at night. Nice access to walk across the dam."
78906,490450,5,ahk,23/05/2019,The place is great and has a beautiful environment - and yet we were all alone here!
78906,464716,4,Tedward,23/04/2019,"Stayed here for two nights and found it to be a really great place. Easy access and level parking - Three spaces as you arrive, but plenty of other spaces.  Just one toilet was open, no lock!  I used the shower which was super hot - in fact too hot!                We cycled around the reservoir (route 18) which took about 4 hours (37k) but be warned - it’s rough, often very steep, it has steps and ends up a very narrow path on a crumbling steep bank! So bad we turned back and took the road..,"
78906,453858,4,Louise71,13/04/2019,"Super spot! On the edge of the lake. Sanitary facilities nearby, but we did not use, shower 0.50 cts 10 minutes. Restaurant. Peach. For all types of motorhomes. In nature. Quiet night without problems."
78906,396130,5,Continuum,20/10/2018,"Really great parking place, very clean toilets and showers. The showers are 50c for 10 minutes of water (very hot too!). Flat parking spaces and the chance to walk or cycle down to a large reservoir, very pretty! Very quiet here in October, no other vans!"
78906,264169,5,bynouze,05/06/2018,"Superb area, amazing that there is no more people to be there. The dam is exceptional (there is a point of view in height), the restaurant next door is very good, showers and WC top (there is one on the four which was doomed and 50 cents are used to trigger the water timer hot but not to unlock the door !!). There are indeed 3 large spaces planned especially for motorhomes but there are many other possible places!"

78908,2108372,5,vstrxd,22/07/2022,"Perfect for spending the night, if you have dogs, those of the locals will come to see you (they are very nice). Very quiet, little traffic, shade, unfortunately very little water because of the drought. Watch out for your trash!"

78921,3153296,4,Coniglio,15/08/2023,"Perfect campsite to spend a few days with the family. Not too small, not too big but with everything you need. Please note that it is 30 minutes from the center of lloret del mar."
78921,3098292,4,olpodama,08/08/2023,"We came with the family. The children really enjoyed the pools and slides. The animation instructors are very friendly. The plots are good, and most have shade. Good atmosphere and pleasant treatment by the staff."
78921,2757994,3,Piaeh,17/05/2023,"The advantage of the place is definitely the location. The spaces are very narrow for larger vehicles and the sanitary facilities are ""okay"". Open, with a roof over it."
78921,2319724,4,DarkVater,30/08/2022,"Nice place, clean and friendly. dogs free. A little further way to the beach. Went illegally to Boatella beach with our small dogs, but that wasn't a problem and according to the locals, nobody checked there anyway. What I don't like is the advance payment. So better extend it."
78921,2276107,2,Linux4ever,20/08/2022,"Well located campsite with a good swimming pool. Too expensive for what it really is. A plot for two adults, a girl and 3 dogs €81 for a single day at the end of August. The sloping and dirty pitches, the old and poorly maintained toilets. They charge you like a first-class Resort but it doesn't even reach a third-class one. All the camping staff super attentive and very friendly, it is the best thing about camping"
78921,2092724,4,family,19/07/2022,"clean campsite, watch out for tree branches for large motorhomes. Dia and Consum 5 minutes walk. And 15 minutes from the beach on foot."
78921,1807176,1,NancySen,05/04/2022,Only giving 1 star as the place was closed. travelling in April so perhaps it only opens for the summer months?
78921,1355295,4,Remolin,23/07/2021,Good camping near the city and with all services.
78921,1166586,2,Alfredarroba,04/04/2021,"Large pitches, also inclined. not even with the chocks it was equal. two washers and a dryer for the entire resort. the dryer didn't work. at the bar 3.5 euros a bottle of water. passable services. just a wavering point from the chemical toilet. and the water was not working. no water to fill AC. no water to drain. for everything else fine."
78921,618507,4,mike2939,11/08/2019,Very good camping super home The places are correct for campers of 7m40 Sanitary clean and various water point in front of the aisles Store DIA 50 meters And hot bread all day next to the reception

78939,1151169,5,Albertlopez,13/03/2021,"Nice place to spend the day and go on excursions. No overnight stay. The access has narrow sections but it is done well, just watch the branches of the trees on the margins that brush. Some park guards told us to park in the lower parking lot for maneuverability issues. 100% recommendable. Let's take care of the environment !!!"
78939,829166,5,marcofurgo,19/06/2020,"We have spent the night, there were several AC with children camping roll. I do not know if it is prohibited but I did not see any type of cartel that prohibits it, camping is not allowed."
78939,826614,1,Bitxejos,16/06/2020,Overnight prohibited. They put fines taking your license plate because it is a natural park and it is prohibited. There is a lot of control day and night by forest guards and rural agents. They even control with drones. Trying to sleep if you don't want to be fined is not advisable.
78939,819215,5,Niletearan,08/06/2020,"Perfect night! We spent the night from Friday to Saturday, when we got back from the excursion we had a note in the van that warned that we could not sleep with the written registration. Tip: arrive at the last minute so that the foresters do not pass"

78939,497990,5,arracuu,31/05/2019,"Really fabulous site! I have been completely alone all night long. In the middle of nature, frogs, birds, flat land covered with grass, possibility of several routes perfectly indicated. I especially recommend climbing up to the summit of Montcau.

The two stars are because of the animals that live in the village and that come up with mobiles and speakers to make noise.

78962,681742,4,St.Paulianer,08/09/2019,"Very quiet nice campsite. The sanitary facilities below the restaurant are great. The woman who explains everything is nice and the place has an access to the lake, however, directly at a marina and only through an investor man gets into the water. For a night anyway nice.

As a campsite there are no infrastructures to be so called, WC away from the parking lot, no AC maintenance place. Space dedicated to the restaurant, where I only drank one coffee and paid 3.80 euros. To spend the night in park closed 23 euros. Very expensive for what it offers."

In the sanitary facilities I recommend the directly below the restaurant, the further back are not really well maintained. The restaurant we tried directly. It is an absolutely upscale restaurant with great quality, great wine, great service - but at a very high price for campers and Portuguese standards. So first of all, look at the map."
