8695,3269768,4,detleffs6768,07/09/2023,"Very nice place, partly in the shade, large swimming pool, not deep, enough for swimming because it is very big! Fitness and sports offers, mini market with everything you need! Restaurant to eat on site or take away! A few minutes walk to the beach! It's about 5 minutes by bike to the town. There are various supermarkets and shops there! We would come again!"
8695,3244036,5,lilou08200,31/08/2023,"We spent 3 nights there, choice of location. Calm. A large swimming pool and direct beach access. Sanitary facilities always clean. Near center."
8695,3231358,5,lalietfred,28/08/2023,"Very large campsite with a large swimming pool and access to the beach, empuria is next door and it is easy to get there by bike or on foot. Two snacks and a small grocery store. Different plot surfaces that change the price per night"
8695,3170209,4,sebrakoto,17/08/2023,Large campsite various pitch of different size close to empuriabrava and on the right side of town. Various sizes of more or less large pitches. Lots of sanitary facilities and grocery store restaurant etc. superb pool great at the opening for swimming after it's too crowded. The only problem are the super loud talking residents.
8695,3158667,4,Socamron,16/08/2023,We spent 3 nights there and were always satisfied with the campsite and the services. Close to the beach and the town centre. Only downside we had to change location each time (without normal reservation).
8695,2974829,5,Daniello,16/07/2023,Campsite ideally located near the beach and empuria. All services on site to recommend. ACSI

8695,2872327,4,lina83,19/06/2023,"Excellent campsite, everything is fine. It would deserve 5/5 if there were a few more trees and greenery on the motorhome pitch side."
8695,2801869,5,christel1975,30/05/2023,"Great campsite, very large place, dog friendly, nice swimming pool, fitness, shop, bar, immediately (almost) after the beach, our stay of normally 2 nights has become 8 nights"

8695,2767334,4,Nelf13,20/05/2023,"we came at the same time last year, that's not bad. not far from the beach, clean toilet and shower, snack bar play area playroom cold 60m swimming pool and gym a bit expensive but very good we will come back"
8695,2742003,3,dombest,11/05/2023,Very nice campsite outside July August or it must be unlivable???? on the other hand relatively expensive for short stays 35 euros 1 bedroom 2 pers 1 dog large plot. Three stars only because the management of pitches is already very complicated with half so imagine in high season. And finally theft of a step and trash container during a walk....
8695,2740196,4,lennertb,10/05/2023,"Neat campsite, solid price, but you do have everything you need. Only the WiFi is still to be paid extra. Nice big pool, relatively close to beach. Big pitches. A 20 minute walk from the city center where you have some nice restaurants."
8695,2731431,4,MatejCabejsek,07/05/2023,"the reception woman was interesting. On the other hand toilets pretty clean, shower aswell. Nice camp"

8695,2641322,4,Samdero,05/04/2023,Beautifully maintained campsite. Close to beach and town.
8695,2433366,4,MMCfamily,09/10/2022,"If mosquitoes bite you, this is not your campsite! It is close to the aiguamolls so it is normal but it is exaggerated... Especially in the 70m2 plots that are closer to the water and there is more vegetation, which is good because in summer there is more shade. The best facilities and all the services it offers, out of season €26 per night 2pers AC. 5' from the beach on foot and 20' from Empuriabrava."
8695,2410735,4,tatianaba,29/09/2022,"We have spent one night and it was great. At this time of year, a plot of 70 square meters, campervan and 2 people €27. It has all the services, very clean. Close to the town and with a bike path at the door. Quiet"
8695,2364066,5,maydasilva,12/09/2022,One of the best campings I have visited. Pets are allowed. Everything is clean. Quite in evenings. Swimming pools are huge so is never too crowded. Staff is very kind in general. Great services.
8695,2354422,5,DavyvdHeuvel,09/09/2022,Well-maintained campsite. Some sanitary buildings are somewhat outdated. Very nice cycling distance from the center of Emporiabrava. And within walking distance of the beach. Stay away from the spots along the water!!! Lots of mosquitoes!!!
8695,2332267,3,tmmvv91,02/09/2022,"Very large CP with all accessories. Unfortunately, we had a lot of mosquitoes and the sanitary facilities smelled a bit musty. In addition, from our point of view, it is designed somewhat unlovingly. The location is very good both for the beach and for a visit to Empuriabrava. The city is very touristy, the beach with very fine sand and clear water. There is also a beach bar right on the beach."
8695,2329096,4,kmaluck,01/09/2022,"The place is very nice, but also very noisy. We stayed 1 night from 8/21 to 8/22. there."
8695,2304357,5,Ninou312,26/08/2022,"We really liked this campsite. The pool is really nice, clean and big. The beach is at the end of the campsite and the sanitary facilities are good. All services for CC"
8695,2040122,5,retomoesch,05/07/2022,"Super nice campsite with everything that has already been described, off-season almost €50 for a 120sqm pitch. The only negative thing about the dog beach is 2 km on foot."
8695,2006780,3,k4pde,24/06/2022,"Good Camping, something negative the little shade in the whole camping. Very large swimming pool, beach a few meters away and visiting Empuriabrava at a 10-minute walk."
8695,1970454,5,samuelixx,12/06/2022,"Nice campsite, friendliness, cleanliness and comfort. Very beautiful beach and sea in front. Nothing is missing from the swimming pool either. Pitches towards the sea with little shade."
8695,1923834,4,stemag,28/05/2022,"comfortable large campsite, superb huge swimming pool very pleasant as expected small flat not much shade on the pitches and no separation"
8695,1899732,3,MurielEric40,19/05/2022,"Large comfortable campsite, beautiful swimming pool. On the other hand pitches not delimited by hedges .. suddenly a lot of promiscuity"
8695,1880345,5,jpvd63,09/05/2022,"Passage for two nights. Good welcome, possibility to choose your pitch after visiting the campsite. The prices of the pitches are different depending on the surface. Beautiful swimming pool, nice games for children (indoors and outdoors) and a well-stocked small supermarket. €28 per night for a van, two adults and two children during the April holidays."
8695,1864745,4,Davidal86,01/05/2022,"Perfect campsite to spend a few days. Correct equipment. If you go with children it is perfect as it has a mini club (playroom with monitors), a heated pool and several sports areas. To put a downside is that the Wi-Fi has to be paid separately."
8695,1858681,5,Kodiak47,28/04/2022,"Super campsite with several pitch sizes. Water and electricity directly on the site terminal. Numerous sanitary facilities with toilet cassette emptying, special room for bathing babies, etc. Everything is very clean and cleaned several times a day. Large 60x15 swimming pool + paddling pool. A restaurant + a snack bar, minimarket, laundromat, gym, etc, etc… in short, the best for a campsite by the sea."
8695,1846762,5,BeritPaschek,22/04/2022,"Great campsite just a stone's throw from the beach. We were here in the early season (Easter). You have to pay for the WLAN, a week costs €15, but it works perfectly. The old sanitary facilities are completely okay. €36 for 2 adults and 2 children."
8695,1819816,5,vijobi,13/04/2022,Super nice reception. Nice big pitches. Short way to the beach. Small supermarket and bistro available. Good cycle routes to the port and shops. Nice and quiet location.
8695,1502557,5,cocofifi31,23/08/2021,"Super campsite very clean, friendly welcome to book before"
8695,1497478,4,Pepineta21,22/08/2021,"Good location, the plots can be improved in terms of grass, the size is very good, we put a van and a motorhome and even so, we had room. The pool and the other facilities of 10. A lot of cleaning in bathrooms, showers and sinks. A success."
8695,1456232,4,frado24,14/08/2021,Very nice campsite with water point at each pitches and several places to empty the cassettes. Very quiet despite the crowds

8695,1353839,4,leavanaart,23/07/2021,"Very clean and beautiful campsite with fitness studio, pool, restaurant, lounge and lots of opportunities for children (soccer field, basketball court, table tennis, billiards, climbing playground, 1 additional playground directly at the restaurant, entertainment all day long with a mini club. Very friendly staff in a good mood. Price in high season for 2 people. 80sqm parking space € 55 / night."
8695,1300397,4,Urroztarra85,06/07/2021,"Very good facilities and access to the beach. € 34 2 people and a small Camper 1 night. It has many and varied plots, although we requested a small one for our Camper and as there were no vacancies they located us in a corner that could be quite improved, without shade. We would have paid for a bigger one with better conditions. Very cool and large pool. Recommendable."
8695,1279741,5,ceizca,27/06/2021,"Highly recommended, excellent location 15 min from the center of Empuriabrava on foot. There are plots of all kinds according to need. The pool a 10. The correct services. We have been to Sant Joan bridge, it was busy and did not feel overwhelmed by people. I think it lacks a little more shadow. We will repeat."
8695,1210384,5,midel62,22/05/2021,"Accessible to large campsites because, all amenities, everything else is said"
8695,999838,5,esterzgz,24/08/2020,"The best pool, we have hardly stepped on the beach, A large but close place, very nice and friendly people, we have been very comfortable. We will be back."
8695,758165,5,Teckel1973,28/12/2019,"Large campsite. Dog beach nearby. Supermarket including camping items on site. Catering, pool, supply and disposal, showers toilet available. Not for me, because it is very busy and everything is close together."
8695,705586,5,heikiki,27/09/2019,Was just there. So no sound from loud and dusty! Of course I am 30 years young and do not need a nap. So for a campsite really great! The toilets smell a bit sunniest really top top. As it is in the high season I do not know. But definitely something going on. The store must also be financed. At the end of September a retiree but all very friendly!
8695,672843,4,aussi,02/09/2019,Yes it is Dusty but it has not rained for a long time the swimming pool is great you have to go early or late if you want to swim properly. The washing machines are the best and cleanest I have ever seen on a camping. The beach is a boat show on the weekend with a lot of noise!
8695,597890,2,Sterntaler,04/08/2019,"LOUD! DUSTY! CROWDED! That's the way to describe it ... We've been coming to the square for many years. Unfortunately, it gets worse every year ... The rest periods are not respected at all! Even after 24 hours driving cars and there is noise in the square. There is zero control for nocturnal disturbance. Neighbors who are noisy until well into the early morning are not warned. In general, it is a place without rules ... The snack disposed of at night at 00.30 o'clock his glass bottles in a glass container ... The pool is very nice and big, unfortunately it is too small for the crowds. You ""stand"" in the water, swimming is not possible. There are now many bungalows. Space for large campers Nausea! We had extra specified our vehicle dimensions at the time of the reservation, to determine then on the spot that the place is much too small. Alternative- None! A problem is the audience, there are streets full of Dutch! Accordingly, the nocturnal noise and the behavior of the young people. Shame about the formerly nice CP. We will not come back after 6 years ...."
8695,509985,5,soga,09/06/2019,"One of the best campsites we have visited. For this season the price is € 22 on a not very large plot but plenty for the van and a tent. A quiet place in this season. I imagine that in high season it will be more crazy. It has everything, swimming pools, gym, supermarket, restaurant ... the bathrooms are good and clean."
8695,451760,4,pdupuis,10/04/2019,"25 euros for a motorhome, 2 adults with electricity in early April, sports class every day, small supermarket with bakery, very close to the center, well secured, quiet, old but clean health, tiny shower, huge pool unheated , very little shade"
8695,370497,1,Roa023,11/09/2018,"I do not advise it! We came from France of tranquility, we arrived and the girl at the reception charged us twice, luckily I realized. Very fair plots and many people with lots of noise and sardine smell. Horrible!!! I do not come back to this campsite anymore."
8695,365970,4,chplo490,06/09/2018,"Very good campsite. Night at 26 €, low season rate, for 2 on medium size location. Sanitary well maintained, superb pool and gym. Excellent value for money, to recommend."
8695,296109,5,vincent3888,21/07/2018,"Camping very nice and very clean. The pool is beautiful and heated. For 4 adults with van, we paid € 57.50 in high season. It may seem expensive but the price / quality ratio is much better than other campsites we tried. Sandy beach at 5 min walk."
8695,250477,5,dajodel,10/05/2018,"Perfect camping with family. Very clean, calm. We will come back!"
8695,241819,4,yeswevan,27/04/2018,"24 € per night for a pitch, 2 adults, 1 baby and 1 child in April, electricity included. Very clean campsite, big swimming pool, games for children. only small downside, the campsite lacks a bit of heat like all the great camping people do not talk much"
8695,197601,5,freddu13,25/09/2017,"Very good camping, many activities possible around, beach 200 m, downtown 10 minutes walk with bike path all along, clean and very large and natural camping, 2 restaurants and a snack gym, pool food etc. .. A recommend, it deserves its four stars, quality report correct."
8695,130733,1,bus1,24/04/2017,"We went to this campsite for several years where everything was great. Last year we went back for a week in a bungalow. Unfortunately, we found ourselves next to Spanish holidaymakers who ruined our week due to night noise and constantly barking dogs. We went to the front desk to complain. We made an offer for a week 2017 and we replied that we had to go back there, because we had caused these problems and it's not our fault so we do not advise you not"".................."

8695,76128,4,riton78180,09/06/2016,"We spent 2 months in campervan € 480 all inclusive, not agree with the comments on the restoration. That's not true, it's not as good as the Macdo"

8695,14339,5,emily,30/04/2014,"Excellent campsite, recommended"
8695,7509,2,robinsonpascal,05/08/2013,"I am on vacation from 31/07 to 15/08/2013, counting 41 € the motorhome location with 2 people and a child of 20 months. The access to the sea is not really ""direct"", more the grid of the campsite closes at 19h after it is necessary to make a bigger turn to return. The cleanliness is very good despite the non respect of some people unfortunately. Large and small pool for adults but a little overloaded when it is hot. Open from 9h to 19h. a little disappointed with the small shop of the campsite especially compared to the photos of the site (no baby department, no diapers, etc ....) small enough so little choice. Big disappointment at the different small ""restaurants"" of the campsite! It's a little ""tricatel"" on the plate. Even if we are camping, we can do much better .... Increase the price of 1 or 2 € and offer good quality! To go in town, it is necessary to do between 2 and 3 km on foot so not easy to refuel without the car. In town, there is a kind of large area at the entrance of the gallery but again the baby section (for eating) is very very small, for nappies no problem on the other hand."
8695,4863,5,mataxel,20/05/2013,"Spent one night in the middle of our trip, excellent cleanliness, direct access to the sea on foot, and bike path nearby. All services in the campsite, paid 26 € for a van, a location of 55 m2, 2 adults and 2 children"

8724,3255431,1,nicolas29300,03/09/2023,"Unacceptable!!! In the campsite there is a plot with tents and mobile homes for teenagers on vacation. They are disrespectful: noise, loud music, making faces at you, yelling, coming and going"
8724,3180795,2,vinnydu74,19/08/2023,the places.de camping car for a 7.5 m are quite large but difficult to access the entrance is not wide at all pay attention to the mirror which does not fold the place for a 7.5 m camper is the xl a 82.82 € per night expensive anyway
8724,3048844,2,MAGH,30/07/2023,"Average and more expensive than others. Electricity 9 euros a day. We were near several summer camps and the bathrooms and showers at specific times were busy and overcrowded, having to wait to use them. It's good that it's next to the beach, and along the beach you can walk to the town along a wooden path without going around it, but little else."
8724,3040376,1,coporado,29/07/2023,"unbelievable what is happening here. There are two tented camps on site and the youngsters act as if they are the only guests. It looks like a mess, loud music and bawling until late at night. The campsite does nothing. Also cold water in the showers. Only the location is good. Too bad and then also expensive. We won't be back!!!"
8724,2917499,4,TielleDias,03/07/2023,"Good camping. In front of the sea, easy access to the beach. Easy access to nearby beaches. Close to supermarkets and shopping area. Excellent camping staff, all very kind. To improve, it could offer water supply close to the plot, so as not to have to move the motorhome to one of the recharge points."
8724,2889959,4,Marisaleo,25/06/2023,"We have been very quiet and close to the beach, all good, we are thinking of returning."

8724,2731111,1,Post-T3,07/05/2023,"unfortunately massively overpriced for the performance offered. VW Bus 2 people, no electricity 46 euros in the pre-season. No hot water to wash dishes, in the shower only reasonably warm after a very long time. Very long ways to the toilet. Not recommended."
8724,2697002,3,petralaaa,25/04/2023,Camping site directly on the beach. Shops in the immediate vicinity. Restaurant unfortunately absolutely not to be recommended. Toilets and showers / were okay. Unfortunately there are no toilet brushes. Okay for a stopover.
8724,2662887,2,Schrippenbravia,11/04/2023,"As already described by others. Short distances to the beach, Aldi, Lidl, Decathlon and the town center. Negative the hygienic conditions in the bathroom and toilet area. No toilet brushes!!! Unclean and dirty. We're definitely not coming back."
8724,2351754,1,celineresine,08/09/2022,"Just help out for one night. Pitches glued to each other, directly opposite. View of the garbage cans on either side... We were lucky, the summer camp side of the young groups leave in the afternoon with loud music. Limited sanitary facilities. In short, except for the direct access to the beach, nothing to please."
8724,2284061,2,floundinesontour,22/08/2022,"Too expensive! 1 night (VW T3, electricity, 2 people) €73.32 (€62 + €10 electricity), too few showers, if someone next flushes the toilet, the water in the shower gets hot. no toilet paper, no toilet brushes. You can't regulate the water temperature at the washing-up points for the dishes, it's set too hot. 40€ would be ok but for this price we would have expected a lot more. Not recommended!"
8724,2275668,1,Laetitiamtrg,20/08/2022,"Come for its location on the very beautiful beach of oro and the access to the cami de ronda magnificent but! 36e per night including 10e for electricity (1 van, 2 adults and electricity), undersized, dilapidated and dirty sanitary facilities. Huge youth camps in the campsite: lots of noise!"
8724,2251764,1,andy71,16/08/2022,"We stayed from mid-August 2022, and 22 years ago. Unfortunately nothing new and everything stayed the same. Very nice and large campsite with direct access to the beach. Unfortunately minus points for the cleanliness of toilets and showers. Not a single toilet brush."
8724,2244818,1,kreos,15/08/2022,"€65/night for a motorhome and 2 adults for the service offered: old and dirty sanitary facilities, pitch without shade: it is better to flee."
8724,2190464,2,jurosevic,07/08/2022,"We have spent 7 days here and would not come again. Here are positive and negative things:

positive: shady pitches, baby washroom and location (directly on the beach)

negative: VERY BAD organisation, dust is everywhere, aprox. waiting time for shower is 20 minutes, too many too loud young people, not so clean facilities, playground full of garbage."
8724,2076705,4,dikkedirk,15/07/2022,Location campsite fantastic. We walked from our place through the gate directly onto the beach. Toilet block are clean. But expensive. About €50 per night
8724,2013850,5,ebbinho,26/06/2022,"Nice campsite with direct access to the beach. There is a small supermarket and a great restaurant. The campsite and the sanitary facilities are very well maintained and clean. It can sometimes get noisy at night, but the place is definitely suitable for families. There is even an extra washroom for babies. The place is relatively expensive at 45 € / night without electricity. We would still come back anytime."
8724,1966001,3,SPIZA,11/06/2022,"The campsite is fine, simple and small but fine. It does not have a pool but it is on the beach. Moderately small and asymmetric pitches, although they allowed us (3 vans) to park in an unparked area near a power outlet. The toilets were very good and there is a small store on the campsite and it is close to supermarkets."
8724,1896599,2,sl907,17/05/2022,"partially shaded campsite right by the sea. That was the positive point. You could save the rest. Dirty showers and toilets, everything is getting old. Poorly accessible supply and disposal for fresh and gray water. Very friendly staff except for a few. But - absolutely overpriced pitches. Early May for XL space 40 EUR - two weeks later 56 EUR."
8724,1591808,1,JoyceFred,19/09/2021,"The dirty campsite main sanitary block closed, you have to go to the other end of the campsite without information on arrival. noisy at night in the square next door, young people passing by, talking loudly, public cleaning at 3am and vehicles moving around when the road seems closed during the day. 2 vans spent the night there, do the same do not disgrace this campsite !!!"
8724,1588852,5,lauraFdzPrz,18/09/2021,"Very good camping. We spent 2 nights with AC approx 30 euros / night 3 people) electricity 7 euros apart. Wide sites, trees, direct access to the beach, clean facilities and safety and respect for the hours of night rest are ensured. Night watchman. We ate in the restaurant and everything was great (nachos and black rice). We leave very happy, we would return!"
8724,1496968,1,Robydeieso,22/08/2021,"We paid 61 euros (2 adults and 2 girls), expensive for what it offers. Dirty bathrooms. presence of a holiday village for young people inside the campsite so a lot of confusion and wake up at 7 in the morning with loud music. not recommended. only positive side is the direct access to the beach, crystal clear sea."
8724,1466300,4,frogim45,16/08/2021,"Campsite with direct access to the sea. Beware of shaded areas under the pines because there is a high risk of sap on the blinds! The star less is due to the lack of friendliness of the staff, too bad! I recommend all the same thanks to the affordable price in high season and ideal geographical location. We should come back to it."
8724,1432783,4,frederic1967,10/08/2021,Very good campsite with direct access to the beach washing machine and dryer sanitary cleaning regularly 41 euros in August with services close to shops. I recommend.
8724,1359353,4,Edusil,24/07/2021,"Unbeatable location, direct access to the beach. Simple camping, good price for the area. Shaded and well-kept plot. The only negative point is the young people partying who made the bathroom impractical. The next morning there was vomit, feces and used tampons thrown around the bathroom. But during the day clean bathrooms and quiet environment (the young people were located in another area)."
8724,1340242,5,beatruchu,19/07/2021,"Beautiful camping! Right on the beach with private access. Very very well equipped, the campsite is huge and there was a laundry area with a washing machine and dryer for a fee of € 4 and € 3 respectively. Great showers too ☺️"
8724,1338347,4,curroriginal,18/07/2021,Good camping. Correct services Very nice staff. Shaded and exit to the beach. I recommend it.
8724,1323450,3,Maike2504,14/07/2021,"Nice campsite with direct access to the beach, sanitary facilities were good, fair price, staff speaks a little bad English, we had to request our preferred place right by the sea despite a reservation, but was then accepted. The big drawback are the party groups which roar along the beach until 5 a.m. and there is no supermarket within walking distance unless you want to haul."
8724,966428,4,ttel,15/08/2020,I don't know what kind of campsite people go to but it's a very nice campsite and on the beach itself. very very well priced: van 2 people 36 € night

8724,599724,1,mariina,05/08/2019,"The only good thing I can say is that they close at 11pm. The price was very high € 36, and on the plot we were, there was a tree and there were two huge rats. I'm sorry but I don't recommend it"
8724,575591,2,chusrocoso,25/07/2019,"Camping in front of the beach, services well, attention not very good, we were given the plot with a dog feeder full of food scraps and did not even deign to remove it ... The van brushed with branches, I asked if it was the only way to enter the plot and affirmed, then we discovered that there were 3 roads through which we did not open grazed ... The plot said with shadow and it was really scarce ..."
8724,518150,1,Argfra,16/06/2019,"Near a beach and nothing around, no pool, noisy, with permanent camping inside, young, big, ugly toilets, washing cars, 5 euros, expensive! A éviter"

8724,48607,3,Moon63,13/08/2015,"Camping by the sea and downtown. Shops Aldi, Decathlon and others at 500 m. No water or evacuation on plot (very constraining). Only 2 shower blocks. (You have to like queuing ...) Population very disparate but very quiet despite the groups of young people because camping is very strict on the noise (But if possible avoid being on the side of Dutch and German holiday clubs) . No swimming pool but a beach of big sand with a translucent sea (Attention with children because at 3 m we do not have any foot)"
8724,14386,2,fredyg42,01/05/2014,"Bad. 30 € the night. Sanitary clean. But nothing for motorhomes, no emptying for the full of water. Beach pebbles not great for children."
8803,3289932,5,ElyC.M,12/09/2023,"Spectacular area, you pay 4 euros for 24 hours. close to beaches and promenade. They don't let dogs on the beaches."
8803,3279947,5,Paichi,10/09/2023,"Great place at this time. In summer it is chaos, there are too many people. Clean beaches, routes. The area has few spaces, but the parking meets the need for parking. Pay the €4 because we are quite invasive when occupying the parking lot, which is also for cars, so we make a profit. Please, those of you who travel with children, remember that it is not a playground, there are parks, we want peace of mind"
8803,3271944,5,josebene,08/09/2023,"Beautiful town, very clean and parking for 10. You pay €4 per day but perfect"

Public parking for cars and of course this fantastic area for motorhomes that has made us repeat for the second year in its surf school. Quiet, with sea views, with all services. The town is very beautiful, ideal for walking around. Its very nice people. The shops within walking distance. Delighted to repeat one more year."
8803,3245458,5,mica2021,01/09/2023,Area very close to the sea and the beautiful town of Tapia. Services and walks on the beach. The parking meter didn't work so Nadia charged us nothing. recommendable
8803,3211277,3,AnaOrtega,24/08/2023,Good area at the foot of a beautiful beach that we motorhomes like a lot. This beach at low tide becomes four. Tapia has a salt pool in an old cetarea The squares are too narrow... If you like cider and good food at a great price La Cubierta
8803,3202625,4,Adone93,23/08/2023,"Convenient, close to the beaches and the picturesque center of Tapia"
8803,3201063,4,JoseCarlos81,22/08/2023,"As said in other comments the location is excellent for the beaches and the town, but the spaces are small and long motorhomes may have problems finding a suitable site."

8803,3182857,3,ETRVSCOS,19/08/2023,"Unbeatable location... but I give it 3 stars in terms of narrow and short spaces... the parking meter never works, the clean water tap takes forever, the limitations between plots are a bit doubtful. and they put any type of vehicle (cars with a mattress).. so three years that we make a stop in Tapía always the same."
8803,3177139,5,Teresagrau,18/08/2023,"good night . My baby lost a blanket doll that sleeps with him walking through the motorhome parking area. We went crazy and looked for him and there was no way to find if anyone saw him please get in touch, it is not worth it if the baby sleeps with him since he was born. thank you"
8803,3151177,4,TximistMTB,15/08/2023,"The area is very good. Next to the beach and close to the town. As stated in a previous comment, it is not that the spaces are small, what happens is that people park badly. Before it was a car park but now it is an area for motorhomes. The spaces are those delimited BY THE WHITE STRIPES"
8803,3148731,4,Mirpe,14/08/2023,"Site well located, next to the beach and 10 meters from the port. On the other hand, very small parking spaces for motorhomes."
8803,3140935,4,elturito,13/08/2023,"Was only there to empty the toilet and get water. You can't clean the toilet singet because there is no water tap for flushing or refilling at the drain, but luxury problems.,. After all, you can have water for free and empty the toilet."
8803,3131754,3,Javi.CaVa,12/08/2023,"The only good thing is the situation, everything else is bad. The holes are for cars, impossible to level even with wedges, if you don't arrive early in the morning there is no hole. People park as they can. The town is very pretty, worth the visit."
8803,3130417,4,moraida,12/08/2023,"Good place, clean, central and quiet. Squares a little small and very crowded in the middle of August"

8803,3113045,4,sergiodmal01,10/08/2023,"I have read that the squares are narrow, but it is not like that. It was an old converted car park, and the motorhome spaces cover 2 car spaces (from white line to white line). Few people pay attention to the white lines and they park next to each other and do not respect the spaces."
8803,3111405,4,sonyapipi,09/08/2023,Quite narrow and short spaces. Very well located for the beach and downtown.
8803,3100312,4,La_Bicha_III,08/08/2023,"It is a quiet parking lot and one that sleeps well, plus the fact that it is close to the beach and the historic center. The only problem is that the spaces are a bit small. In addition, you have to pay about €4 for 24 hours."
8803,3097507,4,JAVI1966,07/08/2023,"Parking for motorhomes maximum 72 hours (price 4e/24h). Capacity for around 60 motorhomes, although it can be less as the spaces are not very large. We arrived on August 7 at 3pm and there were still some free spaces. Located about 200 meters from the two beautiful beaches of Tapia de Casariego and the path that takes us to the small port of the town, bordering the sea. It's worth it especially for the location."
8803,3092893,4,northcraftervan,07/08/2023,"Paved parking with a slight incline, a step away from the beach and a walk from the town. Good atmosphere in the port area."
8803,3065703,4,Luporelmundo,02/08/2023,"Well located, a step away from the beach and a walk from the town. We were comfortable spending the night. Do not miss some rations in the port at sunset. The worst: Squares somewhat uneven and VERY narrow."
8803,3057657,4,Mado6,01/08/2023,"Ideally located to enjoy the beach Lots of people, narrow and short place. For 4 € we are quiet, calm at night. On the other hand village no interest."
8803,3052068,1,Niculescus,31/07/2023,"That they charge you for a site that is not level, the large motorhomes almost do not fit and that you cannot get tables or chairs a bit ugly there are much better places nearby (Serantes beach)"
8803,3050975,4,CarmenIgne,31/07/2023,Area with services (we do not use them). Well located facing the sea. From there you can make a path that borders the beautiful coast. It has a saltwater pool on the edge of the sea. Small town. The area is a bit noisy but it is understandable in this day and age.
8803,3040944,4,Escalam,29/07/2023,"First of all, I would like to thank Tapia de Casariego for the area, the places are very fair if you stand within the marked lines, most of us sit leaving a plate unoccupied and naturally a lot of space is lost, to empty the greys, you have to walk a lot on the sidewalk and we don't see the two signs, otherwise it's perfect, close to the beach and the town."
8803,3039485,5,oinotna,29/07/2023,"Beautiful place, next to some spectacular beaches, you have to wear wedges, uneven plots. I have to write a bad review, which is that the sewage drain does not have its own tap. Otherwise you rest very well and very quiet. RECOMMENDABLE."
8803,3036757,5,martirucky,28/07/2023,"Great place to sleep, next to the town and several beaches, we spent a great night, you have to have money changed, we will repeat without a doubt"
8803,3034646,5,BeayAsier,28/07/2023,"A beautiful place, large area and good location, perfect for going to the beach. The only thing that is a bit uneven, but it can be put on. Thanks to the town hall!"
8803,2955842,4,andiundmaeggi,12/07/2023,"Place is clean, water and trash cans available. The view and the beach are very worthwhile. Space costs 4 euros (vending machine). There are toilets and public showers on the beach. Several other campers."
8803,2950977,3,Worth,11/07/2023,"Nice location and good disposal and supply. Since it was apparently once a car parking lot, the plots are only suitable for short campers. Two plots are now 1 mobile home parking space. With a length of more than 5 meters you have to drive over the curb at the back."
8803,2938205,4,Romanini,08/07/2023,it only lacks electricity to be outstanding.
8803,2928112,5,txemalr,05/07/2023,"Very well located area near the town and beaches, spectacular sunset, quiet place, thank you very much Tapia for this area, the inclination that some complain about goes through squares, there are some that do not need wedges."
8803,2919179,3,Supein25,03/07/2023,"The best thing about it is its proximity to the beach and the town. Gas station nearby, discharge of black and gray water. With unevenness in many areas, but we spent a quiet night."
8803,2909737,5,Vchinea,01/07/2023,great place ample parking areas and in a privileged location next to the beach and two minutes from town
8803,2893250,5,Luverto,26/06/2023,"The situation of the area is perfect. A few meters from the main beach of Tapia. To the center of the town and to the port area you can walk in a pleasant walk. Unloading of gray, black and water loading. Some users do not get the 4 euro ticket. Then the city council will toughen the conditions and miss us. For us a great weekend."
8803,2873467,5,PipaFucina,20/06/2023,"Marvelous. Thank you very much to the town hall. The machine to pay only accepts coins, they are 4 euros. The Civil Guard comes by from time to time to check that everything is fine. Security and tranquility. The area is beautiful."

8803,2850160,4,gongovan,13/06/2023,"Area without light, with emptying of grays and blacks. Close to the beaches and the town, which is beautiful to walk. 4 eur/24 hours, an adequate price, it is good to use these types of areas that the municipalities offer for us. It is slightly inclined, very quiet at least on this date (June 12) We will return."
8803,2847918,2,michajung,12/06/2023,"Former car parking lot converted to WoMo space. Spaces are therefore very short, medium and longer mobiles are better across. Space lit as bright as day at night, therefore devaluation. Disposal not particularly good for starting. Otherwise close to the village and beach."
8803,2844061,4,cfeickens,11/06/2023,"Great place to stand!! Neat… and wonderfully close to the beach which is very clean and quiet. Just a pity about the dogs and their noise, they should be better trained."
8803,2821355,3,lutz448,05/06/2023,"It is certainly a good parking space if the vehicle is no longer than 6.50 meters and even that is borderline. A car parking lot was probably converted here, but the spaces were not enlarged. We drove on with our 8.50 meter mobile to Puerto do Vega, the parking lot there at the port is ideal for larger campers (it is also signposted for campers)."
8803,2800147,4,park4nightrenaandjohn,29/05/2023,"We spent a lovely night here. A bit sloped so we had to chock. The surrounding beaches and town are fab. A great spot for a night or two. Would recommend. People, of course, ignore the rules about camping behaviour which is a pity. The council is great to provide this service for €4."
8803,2721764,5,Isartk,04/05/2023,"very beautiful environment, several beaches in front but beware dangerous for children. charming village nearby. quiet at night."
8803,2675814,5,Fofobolson,16/04/2023,Area that is very good. It has a cost of €4 and has emptying services and a tap to load water. Next to the beach and close to the town center. It is necessary to put chocks on the motorhome due to the unevenness.
8803,2616437,5,AsturVanFamily,19/03/2023,"The area is great, close to the town and in front of the beach. It has emptying of gray and black waters. Also for water filling. The €4 rate seems appropriate to me, even though it was out of service. The spaces are small, although for larger Motorhomes they can manage by parking backwards and occupying the grass with the rear. 100% recommendable."
8803,2604487,5,brunogino,10/03/2023,"Thanks to the community for this great and cheap place with a very good view! However, the plots are much too short for the majority of today's mobile homes! Maybe it could be improved again?"
8803,2590144,5,Vido76,25/02/2023,Amazing views ! We feel safe! Near downtown! Thank you to the municipality for this beautiful place! The 4 euros are justified!
8803,2570791,4,MURERJO,07/02/2023,"Very well placed area with a superb view of the ocean. No electricity or gray water drain but possibility of soon black water, clean water filling. Price of €4 for 24 hours, nothing to complain about except a big thank you to the municipality for this initiative."

8803,2530256,1,Chema54,27/12/2022,"The area is good for being in a place close to a beach and all the services of the town. Against it, it has that the parking spaces are inclined and that they are rather small compared to their length. It has water and gray and black water can be discharged, with respect to gray water it is badly designed, a small grate and the water runs down the street with the problem of odors and discomfort."
8803,2508755,4,carlgns,29/11/2022,Very good location. Perfect to know Tapia and its beaches
8803,2506146,5,Alt_J,26/11/2022,Close to the center and the beach with many free spaces. Very calm.

8803,2473646,3,nachokbl,31/10/2022,"The facilities are correct and the location is good, near the town and the beach. The problem comes from the fact that, being so big, there is always someone who does not respect the rest of the other users and arrives at night, leaves the engine running for almost 1 hour and starts chatting outside the car. Or those who start the car 1 hour before leaving... If we all did the same, no one would rest."
8803,2452712,3,annaworley,20/10/2022,A nice view but we were woken early by council workers strimming the grass right up against the van - we had deliberately parked on a pitch that had already been cut along with 8 or 9 other vans. We asked where we should move to and he pointed to the road! Had no opportunity to use water or waste which was disappointing but other than that a peaceful night in a beautiful area.
8803,2418078,5,Sin.deentrega,02/10/2022,good motorhome area. thank you very much to the town hall
8803,2387604,3,LottieTVB,20/09/2022,"We didn’t stay night as had already stayed free down road. But clearly marked parking bays, no electricity, but water and waste and rubbish bins. Great location for port, beach and restaurants in this lovely town"
8803,2383266,4,JAGOBO,18/09/2022,"Nice area, but with a slight slope. Close to the beach and downtown. Large motorhomes can be a problem when parking. Due to the slope, the gray water discharge area is not very well designed."
8803,2375394,5,Gueko,15/09/2022,"A great area, in a nice, clean, quiet place, close to the promenade along the coast and the town. Thanks to the council for this site"
8803,2340158,4,jisjis,04/09/2022,Area with correct services. It should be indicated how the squares are (between the white lines) because it is not something intuitive.
8803,2331067,4,Didacanis,02/09/2022,"Thanks to the town hall for having such an area, with many squares, services, close to the town and close to the beach. Too bad that many behave as if they were in a campsite."
8803,2321076,5,Lusanfer,30/08/2022,"Thank you very much Tapia for this area. It would be necessary to put the sign of not taking out tables and chairs, etc., a little bigger, because it seems that some do not see it well. We are that way."
8803,2319850,5,RichardG.,30/08/2022,"Thanks to the Town Hall of Tapia, with places like this it is a pleasure to travel in AC. Ideal to be able to visit the beautiful town and go to the beautiful beach in one step. Area for enough AC emptied of blacks and grays (a little badly located, but no more) and two water taps."
8803,2315627,5,ocebelamax,28/08/2022,"a big thank you...very nice location...beach 100m away, very beautiful and perfect for taking small waves..we attended a surfing competition...4 € per night...charming town to visit in bike..."

8803,2287088,5,bodysalta,22/08/2022,"What a wonderful site, the best I've seen apart from the French sites obviously. All coastal areas should learn, instead of prohibiting so much they should do as here, regulate it by charging a fair fee for it. To put a but it must be said that the places are somewhat fair"
8803,2266178,5,Ele6,19/08/2022,"Quiet place, we spent 2 nights. Next to the beach and near the center. Beautiful boardwalk. Next to the area there is a huge grassy field to release the dog."
8803,2262027,3,sindias,18/08/2022,"I give it a three because the places are a bit rare, but the location is magnificent and very quiet. The squares are between white lines but that does not put it anywhere and generates confusion. Thanks to Tapia, we will be back. They charge 4 euros per day"

8803,2245004,5,belarmino,15/08/2022,Very good place to spend the night. Right next to the beach. It is worth paying the 4 euros. Very spacious and quiet place with all the services. Too bad they don't let you take out a chair or a table. It would be good
8803,2232641,3,park4nightYHN,13/08/2022,"Area in a location very close to the beach and the town, with a very pleasant promenade that connects with the oldest part of the town and its port. The seats are tight for the large ACs and you get so close that you barely have room to open the door. The emptying area queues in summer. Otherwise, it is ideal to spend a few days in this beautiful area."
8803,2229893,2,Nippers,13/08/2022,Is it so difficult to understand that you have to put the motorhome between the two white lines? There is one as long as I park that I can't even open the doors! It's amazing…one gets up early for another to come at two and put it next to you that you can't even open the windows!
8803,2229451,4,bravelittleduplo,13/08/2022,Nice place to visit the city and spend the night. Remember not to park on the grass outside of the designated area in the morning a nice policeman cane and asked us to move
8803,2223606,5,sabimenendez,12/08/2022,"The location, unbeatable. Next to the beach and a short walk from town. According to what they informed me, it's a car park converted for ac's, that's why the spaces are so narrow. For this they have painted the seats white, one yes and one no, so that each ac uses 2 car seats. If we park in the middle of the 2 it will be easier to maneuver. please, without setting up the stall."
8803,2217404,5,Rderemoto,11/08/2022,"Thank you municipality of Tapia de Casariego. This area is a gift to acs. Clean comfort, central, spacious. With emptying and filling very comfortable and clean. The beach... right here. The views of the infinite sea. A living and moving area. thank you town of tapia de casariego. Restaurants gas station ice cream parlors and shops. friendly tourist town"
8803,2214893,3,alteo,11/08/2022,We spent the night the pitches are really small in length since we have a 7 m camper Some of the places are sloping after the water services are there! Too bad even tap for clean water and cassettes. Otherwise quiet in the evening and nice view
8803,2207133,5,ivannoe1980,09/08/2022,"Great area, the town is beautiful and with a lot of atmosphere, the Area is great with all the services and next to the town and the beach, for €4 it is more than good."
8803,2198748,5,Saseali,08/08/2022,"Area with sea views, if you find a good spot and arrive early. if you arrive late you look a bit black to park because at this time of year it gets crowded. ideal for windsurfing, the walk that goes to the town is very beautiful and has a natural pool."
8803,2184470,4,cjaragon78,06/08/2022,Very well. We stayed one night. Next to the beach and very close to the natural pool. A very nice walk from the port. It is a very nice town
8803,2171394,4,kokorito,04/08/2022,"Very comfortable area to go to the beach and Tapia. The plots are just wide enough for motorhomes, whoever made them must have thought of cars, not AC. For the rest it is fine."
8803,2167439,3,vanasturias,03/08/2022,the squares are small. for the rest the views are good
8803,2164459,4,Rekalde,02/08/2022,"Motorhome parking for €4, 24 hours, 100 meters from the beach and 5 minutes from the port (bars and restaurants), thanks to the Tapia town hall for providing us with this place."
8803,2154078,5,Fanuchi,31/07/2022,"situation next to the beach, with all the services and the town a step away"
8803,2153881,5,oguiri,31/07/2022,"Comfortable and well located to enjoy this great town. Even so, I think that the council should repair numerous tiles and it would not hurt to clean the grass area a bit in the squares towards the sea. dirty broken lid"
8803,2152874,2,lumoco,31/07/2022,"Only conditionally suitable for long mobile homes, formerly car parking lot. Often not possible to overhang at the back. Parking between 2 white lines is often misunderstood. You can be parked. EVERYTHING FORBIDDEN = uncomfortable, uninviting. (Unfortunately, photos can no longer be attached). Very nice town and beach. Price/performance is OK"
8803,2147722,5,Abogaya,30/07/2022,The parking meter works now. €4 24 hours eye only coins. Max. 48 hours. Great area to visit the town and spend the night.
8803,2142678,5,autocaramarcos,29/07/2022,"good place to visit a beautiful town, thanks Tapia"
8803,2141501,5,Les4loups,29/07/2022,"Superb area (location, services, panorama) to spend the night and visit the magnificent village of tiapa, enjoy its bars, restaurants, walkway. Very beautiful village and nice welcome, thank you to the city!"
8803,2133551,5,ottaviano,27/07/2022,"An amazing view, water and drain and a beach below 20 meters and a nice dip in the ocean. At 500 m. the small port of the town with small bars and restaurants. Delightful location."
8803,2132572,5,siggimueller,27/07/2022,"The parking lot is excellent for RVs. Fresh water, old water and toilet emptying, what more could you want for €4.00. Thanks to the town hall who made this possible, also to the police who do their rounds, thank you very much. The beaches are very good, including the nudist beach 6 km away. Many campers don't know how to park... the white line up to the other white line is the parking space... Visually, these are two parking spaces. We always like to come back to this place :-)"
8803,2127213,4,camidalella,26/07/2022,"Magnificent location next to town and facing cliffs and sandy beaches. It must have been an old car park due to the narrowness of the spaces, but they have been doubled and are now very wide although somewhat short. Anyway, it's very worth it."
8803,2121732,4,ManuMartinez81,25/07/2022,"good zone. somewhat inclined. We were there yesterday, July 24, and although there were many people, it was fine. AC you have to park between the white lines that delimit two spaces, the camper in the individual ones. Regulated parking does not work, so in the mornings the municipal police come by to collect approximately €4/day. you can and should put chocks. 8 minutes from the port."
8803,2107310,4,JoneFernandez,22/07/2022,"Well located area, near the town and beach. From today the local police will collect, since the machine has not worked for a long time. They want to change the system, they have also told us that the car park is from white to white, not the middle one that leaves the spaces narrower. But not knowing it we are all in the narrow square. Let's see if when they change the system they specify it well."
8803,2104941,2,Sandalias,22/07/2022,"Well located, nothing more. Who designed the spaces has no idea, they are the width of the vehicle and the access roads will barely be 4 meters, impossible maneuvers without risking scratching the motorhome. I prayed all night that they wouldn't park in front of me or next to me so I could leave in the morning."
8803,2098249,3,Maite1978,20/07/2022,"The town is close to the car park and the cliff is impressive. However, a place not recommended in high season. Absolutely crowded in July and August."
8803,2094296,4,Loreaq,19/07/2022,"We love this fishing village and we appreciate that they make us a motorhome area to be able to visit it, the squares are quite uneven and you have to do a bit of tetris to get high. The sewage cover is broken, the faucets work properly."
8803,2082952,3,274,17/07/2022,Quiet place to spend a night and visit Tapia. Very small seats. The parking meter did not work.
8803,2076685,3,dikkedirk,15/07/2022,Nice place in nice area. Close to the beach and town. When we were there the terminal was not working but otherwise not expensive
8803,2075714,4,ETRVSCOS,15/07/2022,Super cool area near the wonderful beach and near the town... the bad thing is when it comes to filling clean water since the pressure with which the water comes out is minimal and you eternalize yourself and in the end the AC accumulates...
8803,2069647,4,caroste1,13/07/2022,very very small places. the parking meter still down tonight. very beautiful beaches
8803,2068333,5,Milyunarutas,13/07/2022,"Very quiet area with many squares, very close to the town center and the beach. €4/day but we couldn't pay because the parking meter didn't work."

8803,2052713,5,pendant,09/07/2022,"Great location, just a few steps from the beach with shower and toilet, also close to town, V/E easily accessible, places a little tight but sufficient capacity. Very quiet at night. Parking machine was on 8.7. still defective, therefore free of charge. Absolute recommendation!"
8803,2051656,4,ferargu91,08/07/2022,"Very spacious plots, very beautiful sunset, next to the beach and near the center of town. The parking meter still doesn't work. The gardens are very neglected."
8803,2038364,5,Nathalie2018,04/07/2022,"Very quiet area, sea views. Many parking spaces. The parking meter is not working today. Excellent! It is worth coming and visiting the town, a 10!!"
8803,2028261,5,JAVIKOMEN,01/07/2022,"A great place... well located... and well cared for... as the rest say... a 10 for the Tapia town hall... that's nice... let's take care of it among all and keep it up... PS. Today we have not been able to pay for the night, the parking meter is still not working..."
8803,2016912,5,simancas13101,27/06/2022,"The first congratulations and thanks to the town hall. A 2 min walk from the town center, excellent access to the beach. You see the sea! Free in June, with services, flat. Not a but. The beautiful town, near a natural saltwater pool. Walk along the edge of the sea to the center of the town. A 10. Spectacular sunset without fear of being fined. Thanks to Tapia de Casariego."
8803,2003110,4,Minsche,23/06/2022,"Good, quiet, free and also clean parking space near the beach. It's also not far to the village. We stood here two nights. Water/sewage also free. Beautiful is different, but totally good for surfing/going to the beach."
8803,1985372,4,Fredyzaragoza,17/06/2022,"Excellent parking area. The spaces for motorhomes are a bit short, but very wide since they are marked to park BETWEEN THE WHITE LINES, that is, twice as many as those for cars. Even so, there are always those who think they are more important than anyone else and instead of unhooking the trailer, they park in line occupying two spaces."
8803,1985011,5,WaabsDogs,17/06/2022,"Great place, unfortunately limited to 48 hours. Small supermarket and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Great sea view. Parking meter out of service, but I would like to pay 4€. Service station free of charge. Thanks again to the community."
8803,1970902,4,melaniehardman,12/06/2022,"Great location, flat. Service area clean. Do the walk along the costal path to the port area. The only reason it’s not a 5 is the totally over the top lighting in the park for overnight. Completely unnecessary."
8803,1962575,4,tamgobar,09/06/2022,"Good area, with some unevenness. Today, June 9, 2022, the parking meter is disconnected, even if it were paid, it is not excessive since it would be €4. It is worth visiting the town, along the beach promenade you can reach it in a few minutes. nice views"
8803,1943764,5,Blacky54,03/06/2022,Very nice spacious pitch. There is a well laid out coastal path to curve into the central harbour.

8803,1905953,5,Paichi,21/05/2022,"Great place, many places even better to wear chocks because they are not completely level. There are services. You have to pay 4 euros for 24 hours, the machine does not give change. little beach next door, highly recommended coastal walk. town one step away"
8803,1896764,5,correard,17/05/2022,A great location. The beach just below is wonderful with the emerald-colored ocean. Also the walk to the port and lighthouse. With two-pieces of two euros a day a gift.
8803,1888510,5,NJM,14/05/2022,"An area at 4 euros is not common and we had a view of the sea. A pastry shop 200 m away offers excellent cakes and pastries in the morning, there is bread at the service station. I recommend."
8803,1872223,5,anne.saive220262,05/05/2022,"Great place close to beach and town. Nice view of the coast. Well defined places. €4 for 24 hours, water and garbage included. Thank you to the municipality for this area."

8803,1821295,3,CINZIAontheROAD,14/04/2022,"Very popular area and meeting point for surfers. Parking in medium / high slope very close. Small pitches. Poor view, you can barely see the beach. Convenient for visiting the country and for spending a night in safety and tranquility. Trash cans and really poorly designed loading / unloading area; very sloping, narrow and with a water source not very close."
8803,1796143,5,topeton,26/03/2022,"Highly recommended municipal motorhome area. Spacious, located a few meters from the town center, in the elevated part of the beach area and with a view of the sea. Very easy access, very quiet and well lit at night. It has a cost of €4 which is adequate for maintenance and lighting. Thanks to the Town Hall of Tapia for this area."
8803,1781982,4,Chcol89,13/03/2022,"The places are not well defined and sloping but everyone finds their place, too bad there are recurring nauseating odors. Take advantage of the walk along the seafront and come back through the city center where you will find an excellent pastry shop, Yum."
8803,1780102,5,Phyle,11/03/2022,"An exceptional place! Beautiful walks to do on the seaside. Price of 4 € for 24 hours. Full of water, gray and black water drain. I recommend 100%"

The walk from the beaches to the port is recommended. Gray and black download and font for filling. A 10 for only 4 euros. Thank you very much Tapia de Casariego"

The town of Tapia de Casariego is very pretty and worth seeing. The town has several beaches and a saltwater pool in the summer season. Totally recommended."
8803,1704489,4,alvarop,06/12/2021,"Good location, somewhat steep but acceptable. When draining gray water, you have to put the wheel in the grid because otherwise you are inclined and it does not fall ..."

8803,1670121,4,openend2020,30/10/2021,"Nice and quiet location. Parking bays are actually a bit short, but you can park backwards with the ""overhang"" over the meadow. Nice panoramic path to the harbor and on the other side along the coast. Beach very popular with surfers. The beach showers were still in use, toilets closed. It's a shame that you are not allowed to show any camping behavior despite the parking fee of € 4.00."
8803,1667774,4,MarioFdz,29/10/2021,"Very good location near the beach and views of the sea, although the squares are a bit small for Ac of 7 meters or more, they are also somewhat narrow although when we were there there were not many people with which it was not a problem."
8803,1650963,5,Quicolas,18/10/2021,"Area and parking with services very well located to discover one of the most beautiful towns in the Cantabrian Sea. Get lost in its streets and wander aimlessly, the surprises await you around the corner. Cool and a lot"

8803,1579059,5,JuliaLiAr,14/09/2021,"Excellent area with very good views. lovely town. Be careful, an anti-motorhome neighbor is taking photos and bothering. He took a photo of us recharging water (without authorization!) and focusing on the drain grate that someone had made a mess at night .... take care of the area so that it continues to exist!"

8803,1546488,5,EstebanEtxebarria,04/09/2021,"One of the best areas I've been to. the location next to the beach, with a walk to the port passing through natural pools. the plots are wide since they are from white line to white line. 4 euros are paid at the entrance machine for 24 hours. The truth is that I liked it and it motivates you to stay another day."
8803,1537188,4,massimotossini,01/09/2021,Good area close to the sea and the town. Behind the beach there is a space with a lawn where you can take your dog. The country is very close and nice. The restaurant also deserves the terrace.
8803,1535365,3,jsda,31/08/2021,"Excellent location, everything close, beach, natural pool of the sea (beautiful) port nearby. Parkimeter does not work, parking is prohibited from 11 pm on Wednesday to 5 pm on Friday 9/3/21."
8803,1534210,5,mariviytxus,31/08/2021,We liked. It is the end of August and there is plenty of parking space.

8803,1530960,3,Cirlis,30/08/2021,Good area to visit Tapia and its beach. It is usually quite full so it is not advisable to go very late.
8803,1521670,4,mickemazda,28/08/2021,"Unbeatable location. Next to the town, beach and promenade. Cheap, only 4 euros 24h with free emptying, filling and unloading of the toilet. Disadvantages: -Some squares are small for cars over 7m. -Powerful light of spotlights at night."
8803,1521456,5,richartsbi,27/08/2021,"Unbeatable location, quiet place near the sea, and you can walk to town. At night all very quiet many motorhomes and camper, we made friends with some boys and we were having a beer. Great place and safe"
8803,1521270,2,augustopontes,27/08/2021,"very short area, 7 m motorhomes. can't maneuver."
8803,1518187,4,filipedesigner,27/08/2021,The site has an excellent location. The maintenance area is a little poorly maintained. Space for the motorhome is short. Longer motorhomes or those with supports at the back may have difficulty finding a seat. The payment machine display did not work properly.
8803,1515515,5,pabibadel,26/08/2021,"Beautiful area well placed with all services (be careful, very thin tap nozzle!), Close to the beach and the center. Parking lot full, we even made improvised space for a motorhome (3 motorhomes on two pitches). Not too much noise, quiet night."
8803,1509511,4,eriknoa,25/08/2021,"The area is fine, the bad thing is that large cars do not fit, they have made a motorhome area without looking at the measurements. In any case, it is advisable to visit the town, which has a very nice walk on the side facing the cliffs. The town itself is not worth much, but it is worth taking a walk"
8803,1508770,5,KeberlynFigueira,24/08/2021,Perfect place for a walk on the cliffs. You can surf. Price 4 euros for 24 hours. It has for free water drainage.
8803,1508319,4,FuenteCamacho,24/08/2021,"Great area, with good views and all services. The pitches are white stripe to white stripe (2 car sites), there are some sites that are difficult to maneuver large ACs. Please, those of the vans, cars, etc., who do not relieve themselves in the street, there are portable toilets, they are forbidding us to be in some places due to this problem."
8803,1495646,4,cuyaya,22/08/2021,"A stone's throw from the beaches. Easy access to the water discharge area. Rate of € 4 / day is reasonable for being in such a beautiful area. However, I confirm that the squares are poorly designed: very narrow for ACs - you have to leave a gap between one and the other."
8803,1481352,3,amorettos,19/08/2021,"Thanks to the city council, although it must be said that the squares are car-sized and the larger or more spacious motorhomes are very confined. Sometimes it is impossible not to occupy part of another square if you want to leave space for the one next to it to open the door. Otherwise, a quiet and beautiful place to spend the night."
8803,1477545,4,ilviha,18/08/2021,"area very close to the center ideal to visit the town whose main attraction is the port. A lot of space without problem to park, we go in a 740 motorhome. The only drawback is when it comes to filling the water tank there is very little pressure so there are long queues it is very uncomfortable for me. otherwise. .... thank you very much to the City Council."
8803,1471107,5,MC4333,17/08/2021,"Thanks to the city council for preparing an area how it is for us. € 4 for 24 hours is much less than what others charge for parking for hours. The squares are fairly long, but they are wide, since they go from white to white. The beach at 100 meters"
8803,1471054,4,jairijou,17/08/2021,"Good place to stop and spend the night (48h max). A lot of space (60 places, I think), but somewhat narrow pitches, and only an area for gray and black water. People are respectful: despite the fact that there were many of us, we had a quiet night. The surroundings are very beautiful and worth a visit. I think you have to pay € 4.50, although when we were there the parking meter did not work."
8803,1468821,4,alvanee,17/08/2021,"A very well located area, 2 minutes from the beach and very close to the center of town on foot. The price is € 4 / 24h but we stayed the night and the payment machine was out of service so we couldn't pay. The squares go from one white stripe to the other from what we have been told, so they are really spacious. We had a quiet night."
8803,1467050,5,marimbula,16/08/2021,"We have been two super good days, quiet to sleep, close to the beach, a nice walk until we reach the port along the coast. Quite cheap 4 euros 24 hours we will repeat for putting something bad a little tight to maneuver large motorhomes"
8803,1466766,4,tonipf,16/08/2021,"Thanks to the city council for making this area so beautiful. A fantastic setting. I hope they order the parking lot as clearly as possible. They usually park cars and we have 7 meter vehicles we are forced to leave or, as I have seen, have to argue with the users of the cars. It shouldn't lead to this. Cheer up the enterprising mayors! Thank you."
8803,1464021,5,paularogers,16/08/2021,"Right near the beach, very busy but spots free by mid morning. €4 - 24hrs parking, water, grey & black water deposits I think is a bargain ! Grassy area for your dogs to do their business ( please pick up after your dog ) Nice walk into town with good restaurants right next to harbour"
8803,1463679,4,davibea,16/08/2021,"Beautiful town, area with all very stacked and with AC of 7.4 meters you have a hard time parking, the squares are tiny. Correct filling and unloading services. The price is not bad, € 4. Good location with beach and boardwalk across the street."
8803,1455966,3,kizibleta,14/08/2021,You can hear the next door snoring. Very stacked. The fact that they charge for parking in a parking lot with hardly any means has a crime.

The only drawback is that the squares are very tight, most of them leave an empty space in the middle and are small in length. The town is beautiful, with a lot of atmosphere in the port area."
8803,1434022,5,cuevi,10/08/2021,Stupendous We fit perfectly with 7.43; although we have had to search a bit to invade as little as possible. Very large plots. Very close to the beach and the town. And for only 4 euros.

8803,1417527,4,AlejandroVelasco,07/08/2021,"Area with an unbeatable location, cheap for the area in which it is. He only has one problem and that is that the sites are very, very fair. And please respect the rules since we will charge places like this for not doing it, there were motorhomes with tables and chairs outside and others on the grass area for not putting some chocks, or because they were miserable or lazy. PLEASE RESPECT !!"
8803,1416986,5,Misterlois,07/08/2021,Very well located area in front of the beach and with the town next to it. The seats are small for large AC you have to look a bit to be able to enter us with AC 7.40 we luckily got. In the morning there are more sites. Otherwise it is a fantastic area !!

The spaces are a bit short in length, although they have been doubled in width so that there is separation between the vehicles, that is, each space is from one white line to the next. The machine was out of service and there is a policeman charging that the weekend has not been"
8803,1412569,3,bea7seas,06/08/2021,"The area has a great location by the sea and many parking spaces. € 4 for 24 hours, to be paid in a machine. I give it a 3 because the seats are very short and close together, it always appears and because there is only one area for emptying and filling for so much AC, tap with little pressure and far away. We waited more than 30 min for our turn ... put more taps and emptying areas since they charge for it."
8803,1406822,3,jinete_desconocido,05/08/2021,"Very well located, next to the beach and very close to the town. I give it a 3 because the taps for cleaning potty and filling water are together and next to the chemical toilet and people use them interchangeably. There is little dysentery for what I have seen ... the one to fill waters is the one with a thread !!"
8803,1403832,4,MSIAC,04/08/2021,"This is the third time we go. for our activity of 7.40 somewhat short due to the overhang, but it always makes up for the ride with the bikes to the center of town. a 220 outlet is missed. but the price is quite consistent with the service provided."
8803,1402806,4,Joricod,04/08/2021,Parking lots are a bit short. But very well located and with delivery and emptying services. €4
8803,1397842,3,perichs,03/08/2021,"Thank you very much to the town hall of tapia de casariego, all very well, an excellent location and the town is very beautiful and you eat very well. very nice people"
8803,1378106,5,Mireia13,29/07/2021,"The area is very good. There are many squares, somewhat fair but no one parked next to us and we were very calm. The parking meter did not work, a policeman came and we paid him the € 4. The Tapia promenade is beautiful. About 9:30 pm we went to see the sunset and what a wonder !!!"
8803,1376479,3,Barajita,28/07/2021,"Good place to enjoy the magnificent town of tapia. The area is small and the squares are very fair but the place is very safe and quiet, next to the sea. I wish all the towns had areas at least like this."
8803,1370652,5,Tucha,27/07/2021,Excellent place to park and stay overnight. I order for 24h: €4 includes evictions and water filling. The parking meter is out of order and therefore the charge is made by a police officer from the Civil Guard. There is no difficulty in parking. Quite wide places. Congratulations to Tapia's ayuntamiento.
8803,1368854,4,JJunior,26/07/2021,Very short places for motorhome. Long motorhomes go far ahead or completely invade the back seat. Ticket machine does not work and the police go through the area to collect the €4.
8803,1368378,4,jobro,26/07/2021,Large area but short location this evening I cannot put the coins in the coin mechanism
8803,1361618,4,Sandracaravana,25/07/2021,Quiet place next to the beach Somewhat short places for long motorhomes but worth it Thanks to Tapia
8803,1360920,2,Kamaron,25/07/2021,"Very short spaces, with which people park without respecting the delimitation of the spaces since the rear of the motorhomes do not fit. Canned sardines have more interpersonal space than here."
8803,1356170,4,Tonioga,23/07/2021,"Very well located area. Correct emptying and filling services. Watch out for the AC drain pipe if it's low, it hits the curb. Thanks to the people of Tapia for this area. We will be back"
8803,1355135,4,ndavila,23/07/2021,"With everything you need, a bit of unevenness, they have expanded the squares, a very good location, good views, a beach next to it, a natural pool and the walk that takes you to the center of town. They are 4 euros per night, you get the ticket at the machine."
8803,1352712,5,Jsanch22,22/07/2021,"Spectacular motorhome area, it has water filling and emptying, it has a parking meter but it was out of service, it is very illuminated at night and very well located, in addition the town is very beautiful and taking a walk along the cliffs you reach a spectacular natural saltwater pool"
8803,1341604,4,Ainhowi,19/07/2021,"A large car park and highly recommended to visit Tapia de Casariego, a beautiful town."
8803,1340658,5,VillaG,19/07/2021,Extraordinary ac area with the beach and the town next to it.
8803,1335233,4,silval,18/07/2021,"It is usually quite full, squares not very big but with excellent views. As improvements, the gray emptying area should be more centered and the GC or someone else should control that the use is the one that has been defined since there are cars occupying places and also who is camping."
8803,1323161,4,raulmr51,14/07/2021,"An area very well located next to the town, by the way one of the most beautiful coastal towns in Asturias, with a beautiful beach surrounded by green areas, the price is four euros and you have a very comfortable water change service, thanks to Tapia for this area."
8803,1321922,4,Lunilla,13/07/2021,"Parking a little steep, but it makes up for it. Close to the beach and nothing from the center of town which is beautiful."
8803,1319504,4,aponz,13/07/2021,"Very well located area but with a slope, two minutes from the center, the services very well, although there are people who used them, sleep and are not able to pay a paltry 4 euros. thanks to the City Council for the initiative."
8803,1286418,5,FrancoiseFitamant,30/06/2021,Nice area. Very close to the beach and the village. Services ok. Slight inclination. Well-defined spaces. Quiet night. price 4 euros. Provide parts (no payment by card).
8803,1285346,5,conchiti,29/06/2021,"Right by the sea, beautiful. we slept very well. the lovely town. the squares are a bit inclined, you need chocks. has to recharge water and throw away the gray ones. it cost us 4 euros a night"
8803,1279467,5,Mdd001,26/06/2021,"Very calm and quiet. Sea views and breathtaking sunset. Although you only have to pay 4 euros for 24 hours (in a machine at the entrance of the car park), as there is no barrier or anyone controlling it, I think that many motorhomes make use of the facilities and spend the night without paying anything. Of shame."
8803,1277781,5,viajespipa,26/06/2021,Very nice port to sleep very quiet
8803,1275598,5,criscebral,25/06/2021,Very calm and quiet to sleep. We were about 10 AC and there was plenty of space. Sea views and a beautiful sunset. Perfect for sleeping and taking a walk next to the beach
8803,1265644,5,Abodita,20/06/2021,"Parking for AC and van. Good location, next to the town and 1 minute from the beach."
8803,1240237,4,Aidasita,06/06/2021,"Tranquility to spend the night in the beautiful town of Tapia de Casiego. A few meters from the beach and the town center. There is a machine to get a ticket of € 4 for 24 hours. It is forbidden to take out tables, chairs, etc. It is a tad inclined but nothing exaggerated. There are containers, fountain and sewage drain."
8803,1213897,4,hugogabarrigitano,23/05/2021,"A little inclined, quiet place and close to the beach. Thank you Casariego wall for this area."
8803,1193179,4,taty21,11/05/2021,Good place to spend the night. Payment machine: € 4 A little inclined; You can see the sea from the parking lot; Filling and drainage services; Nice town and beautiful beach;
8803,1173713,3,currodanaonboard,14/04/2021,"Very good site. Next to the beach and the town. Tapia is a beautiful place. The squares are very very fair. It is not possible to complete the existing squares, very close together and very short. There were no problems because there were hardly any people besides the payment machine did not work so it came out round. The air made us leave earlier than expected but if the weather is good and your car is not very big, you will be luxurious."
8803,1173193,5,MikySpinningAsturiano,13/04/2021,"Today the machine was out of service, I don't know how long it will take to repair it."
8803,1169440,4,magair,06/04/2021,They have expanded the width of the squares so as not to hit the neighbor with the door but they are still very short. 4 euros 24 hours with low pressure filling tap. There are quite a few places but it fills up quickly. Next to the beach and the spectacular town. It would be necessary to improve the length of the squares and a reservation system since the place is not reserved when you pay for it so it is better not to move
8803,1149335,5,aradav,09/03/2021,"We were there this weekend and we really enjoyed the visit to Tapia. The area is paved, somewhat sloping, but with places for many caravans and less than 200 meters from the beach. Thanks to the City Council for this area. We will definitely return when it is time to bathe."
8803,1115155,2,Frankiti,14/11/2020,"It is not an area whatever is said, it is a car park where they have put a tap and a sewer to drain the water, a normal motorhome does not fit, and if it is full when you open your door you get into the neighbor's. As I read we settle for anything"
8803,1088162,4,Afbs,10/10/2020,Good area with the beach next to it. I think that the city council would have to invest the parking money to make the parking spaces flatter and bigger at least loopholes for the overhang.
8803,1083172,4,Jonypere,05/10/2020,"Next to the beach, with all services. It depends on where you park, you can see the sunset from the car. Awesome. The 4 stars are because the places are very fair. If the marks are respected, it would not be possible to be 2 AC together. We were in August, and it was almost full"
8803,1074914,3,Jabas8,29/09/2020,"We pass to empty and fill. The place is impressive indeed. The complicated gray cast, a neighbor in the area told us that part of the water was coming down the street."
8803,1054173,3,enriquesendra,17/09/2020,"First, many thanks to the city council for the site. But the squares are narrow, short and with some incline. The emptying of grays in a bus parking space, filling with water elsewhere and emptying of blacks without a tap to clean. The intention is appreciated but you have to ask and get advice."
8803,1050112,4,CandL,15/09/2020,Great location and clean. Attention payment by credit card impossible at the terminal. We spent the night in peace.
8803,1042063,3,alunjenk,11/09/2020,Very noisy extremely small spaces which slope
8803,1037193,5,KKF,09/09/2020,I love the place.
8803,1036739,5,Xaria,09/09/2020,"Impressive views, thank you very much to the city council for this area, they would have to learn many city councils of Spain, food and super friendly people."
8803,1035315,3,johntiernan,08/09/2020,Quite small spaces but everyone managed whilst we were there. €4 for 24 hours parking with all emptying and filling facilities. Very good beach just across the road down some steps. Beach bar with toilets overlooking the beach. Nice town too.
8803,1027560,4,CrisRodAri,05/09/2020,Very well located and with basic services. Quite a few places but very fair.
8803,1023208,4,MSOUTO,03/09/2020,"The area is very well located, the beach nearby and the town as well. Very fair parking spaces for motorhomes but these days are very few, so it can be maneuvered perfectly. You have to get a parking ticket 4 euros 24 hours. Filling and emptying of water."
8803,1011942,4,Armando1,29/08/2020,Very fair squares and narrow places it looks like a car park with all services. The good thing that it is in the town and that the City Council gives us the possibility of being there in a good place although the area can be improved a great initiative of this council
8803,1004670,5,Bluejasp,26/08/2020,"We have spent 24 hours. Great site. The area fulfills its function. The town, views and beaches are great."
8803,997815,4,blor,24/08/2020,"Overcrowded especially when using the AC services area. It is true that the squares are excessively narrow for the ACs, but leaving one between ACs is perfectly practicable. yes, they fit half of ACS. That parking lot is designed for cars or the one who designed it for AC Areas did not know about their motorhomes."
8803,990765,4,hymercamp,22/08/2020,"very well located area next to the beach and in the town somewhat small squares for large AC, quiet"
8803,989559,3,Reclusiarch,21/08/2020,"Not a bad place. Tiny parking spots, good enough for one night and carry on. It does have fresh water."
8803,981061,4,Puma1945,19/08/2020,"We liked it a lot because of its proximity to the beach, having services and being easily accessible. The main problem is the size of the seats, which forces large ACs to occupy two seats. But it is very good."
8803,974963,4,willvy,17/08/2020,Overcrowded area of motorhomes with the usual noise problem. Somewhat uneven but feasible to correct with chocks.
8803,959624,4,VanLoverT6,13/08/2020,Area very close to the beach and the town. € 4 / day. Water filling and emptying area. Somewhat small places but a very good place.
8803,947538,4,ims,10/08/2020,"Very good place and next to everything: beach, town, ... On the beach there is a free toilet with showers that comes in handy for those of us who have a van. Narrow squares but a good place to visit the town"
8803,944328,5,Txekio,09/08/2020,"As the colleagues say, all the squares are uneven but with chocks solved. Great place to spend a couple of days and enjoy this town. Very quiet for the night"

8803,921591,4,RIKILINO,02/08/2020,"I was there, but just passing through, a very beautiful area, with a beach with a very nice walk. I did not get to pay since it was going to be a couple of hours."
8803,915554,4,Peio2014,31/07/2020,"Winged parking of the beach and the town. Change of waters and source. Beautiful beaches and town. 4 euros a night we do not know very well because, given the limited resources available, there is no shade."
8803,902027,4,wuisin,26/07/2020,"Very well located area, next to the town beach and the promenade that reaches the port, with beautiful views. The area has water services and water change. The worst thing is that the parking areas are small and narrow, a problem for long drives. Price of € 4 24 hours."
8803,895942,4,JuanraMobyDick,24/07/2020,"Thank you very much to the council of Tapia for this very well located area, although the squares are short and narrow; Still, I repeat ... thank you very much."
8803,895275,4,Aroat3,24/07/2020,"Very well located in front of the beach and with a walk along the coast to the port, small and with many bars and a good atmosphere. 4 € / day"
8803,883820,2,Amayajubileta,20/07/2020,"Good, good area. Sloping, short and narrow squares. But hey they do their job."
8803,880243,4,msa80,19/07/2020,"Very good location, near the town and all services and the beach down a hill. It has a lovely walk to walk to the harbor. The car parks are small and somewhat inclined so you use one if and one not. Emptying and filling could be improved because the taps are in the same place."
8803,878392,3,nissmanboy,18/07/2020,"Area as described before small, but it does its job. As of today it is quite full but there is some gap, it can be improved but for 4 euros with filling and emptying, which is wanted. It is not on the beach but in 3 minutes you are and the town is beautiful."
8803,873281,3,gemma575,16/07/2020,Area with small plots ... and being on the beach ... nothing ... if you don't parachute ...
8803,871722,5,Egosurf,15/07/2020,Great area for € 4 / 24h. Only the machine works with coins. Beautiful town that is reached by a walk from the area. There is a beach next to it with several beach bars. We dined at the port .... At 7/15/2020 it was less than half the occupancy
8803,868872,3,Aurrutia,14/07/2020,Precious site. The downside is that the squares are a little inclined and narrow. The gray drain is tilted and the grid is small and it is difficult to empty it completely
8803,867106,5,ruterochinchetera,13/07/2020,Fabulous area with incredible views. At night you sleep listening to the waves break. The beach is great for swimming.
8803,865969,4,beyta81,13/07/2020,Large area very close to the beach ... large number of places! Filling and emptying both black and gray! I wish all the municipalities of Asturias had this initiative! They know how to take advantage of tourist resources not like on the Asturian west coast!

8803,785587,4,Escarabello,23/02/2020,"Very well located and quiet area, somewhat uneven but nothing that is not solved with a chock. When we went yesterday the payment machine was put out of service, perhaps it is only paid in season, I do not know."

8803,781836,5,DPRuta,17/02/2020,"Clean area, superbly located. the last two times we were (not summer) there was no more to pay. With municipalities that love us we always consume in the area."

8803,578521,4,19SY69,27/07/2019,"Small places and close together, so very suitable for vans. Larger campers stand out because of this. Despite the high occupancy very quiet. In the morning there is a bakery with fresh bread. The toilet bowl is very dirty and the tap has no thread. Plek is close to various beaches and shops are within walking distance."
8803,578507,5,mickpamg,27/07/2019,"Excellent aire €4 parking fee per day, services are free.  Overlooks a lovely beach, short walk to town.  We enjoyed a very quiet evening, but its very popular."
8803,565979,5,carcueza,21/07/2019,very good area. easy emptying and filling. € 4 price for. maintenance. very narrow spaces pro parks yes and no and so there is no problem. Very close beach and highly recommended to go with children (very short)
8803,560962,3,Monan,18/07/2019,It seems more a camping than a parking. And when you go to empty you find a Portuguese cleaning the ac. Regrettable!
8803,560129,3,nala81,18/07/2019,"Close to the beach, beautiful walks, small parking spaces. Few people at the moment so it's going"

8803,508187,4,Coquillette4X4,08/06/2019,Very well ! Very good idea of the municipality to provide such a place. And that should give ideas to others.
8803,503737,5,Daglan,04/06/2019,Perfect area to go to the beach and visit the area. Only comment that some car parks are somewhat short with which the long motorhomes can have problems.
8803,463057,3,macamen13,21/04/2019,Thursday festive and we did not have to pay. Services and proximity to the town and the beach

8803,413208,4,pepinfitu,09/12/2018,"We spent one night and the parking is not bad, for 4 € it has a large squares and it is a quiet place, where nobody comes to bother you. As it is next to the beach we spent a night of air and it was quite noticeable."
8803,398985,4,Bigben974,25/10/2018,There was room perpendicular to the planned places. 4 € / day is good! Small flat think to bring a tip of reduced size (compared to French faucets). It was a hassle to fill up with water. I want to thank the Swedish couple who kindly lent us their pipe to get us out of this mess.
8803,386936,5,knaussudwind,03/10/2018,Great Parking. We with car and caravan. We have spent the night and spent money in the town. Quiet. Recommendable.
8803,380019,5,luanco84,23/09/2018,"Very quiet and close to the beach, hopefully all the municipalities had an area like this for € 4 a day."
8803,379964,5,Tebi_design,23/09/2018,"Very good area to sleep. There are no noises, there are many spaces to park and close you have where to buy and the beach too. to see if other municipalities follow the example."

8803,374152,4,abas,15/09/2018,Totally in agreement with the previous comment we would like for € 4 I had this in many villages to enjoy them even though the space could be improved and at the same time contribute. But taking out the tiket.
8803,370724,4,johng,11/09/2018,"Actually it's not free, it's 4€ per 24 hours. And parking is limited to 48 hours. As others note spots are very small."
8803,357682,4,jorgeb,28/08/2018,Area located near the beach and within the town. Very narrow and short seats. Very quiet to sleep. Passes baker in the morning.
8803,352750,4,AnaOrtega,25/08/2018,"The Area is perfectly embedded next to a beautiful beach and next to the town. There are no views to the sea. Welcome the initiative, hopefully learn from it many towns in Spain. The only problem is that the squares are narrow and short, it was not difficult to have done something wider, so many people occupy two seats. When it is full it will be difficult to maneuver."
8803,350161,3,FMFO,23/08/2018,"The area would not be bad but the seats are too narrow and the parking lot remains unusable for half. we eventually parked on the lawn nearby, but outside the parking area. near the beaches and the town center."
8803,328214,5,choquito,12/08/2018,Personally I love the area and I love the town.
8803,328182,5,FerReyes,12/08/2018,"The truth, I do not understand how you can catalog badly a quiet place, silent to sleep, overlooking the sea, with water and emptying, with wide streets, nearby beach with green areas, showers, changing rooms, What is a little inclined? take it clear !!! this Asturies and being almost on the cliff overlooking the sea ... It is a joy site."
8803,314202,2,tinou.didine,04/08/2018,It is a motorhome parking lot the long vehicles can not get back to back car truck arranged everyone can put on the locations very tight location we just have enough to open the camper door to get out I find it abusing
8803,313848,1,campero,04/08/2018,The baker's thing in the morning from eight thirty to nine pitando nonstop is for ....... better callo ....
8803,306975,2,gon943,30/07/2018,"I have nothing against paying in an area but that this well done is important. Almost impossible to level the vehicle, neither with air suspension nor levelers. Small stripes for vehicles over 5.40 meters long vehicles put the cantilever in the neighbor's line. In the village (on this day) it parks much better and free. Free loading and unloading services."
8803,306128,2,Miguelete,29/07/2018,"The place is good, but has no limits for motor homes, and nothing prevents parking to other types of vehicles. Charging for this seems excessive."
8803,305970,4,XanMartinez,29/07/2018,Nice site Pretty influx in season ... A step away from the town and the beach.
8803,299881,4,akawana,24/07/2018,Quiet and very beautiful place. The beach near and the beautiful promenade.

8803,255098,4,Biard,18/05/2018,"Friendly, calm. Certainly small location, stick to each other. Stroll in front of sea, nice and small seaside village. To discover."

8803,226636,1,Tornjak,09/03/2018,"Accessible to all types of camper, of course, but this area was designed by an illuminated who has never seen this kind of vehicle. Tiny pitches, sloping and on each other just usable by vans. On the other hand, the view facing the ocean is pleasant. The place is stabilized, lit and close to the village. 4 € / 24h, actually it's all worth it!"
8803,226298,3,alaindeloin33,07/03/2018,There are 100 parking spaces cars but not 100 places for motorhomes. The squares are 2.30 m wide and 5 m long.

8803,204128,4,markhadley,18/10/2017,"4 Euros for 24 hours. water and waste services. Ideal MH parking, super location for town and beach. There is a free area across the road intended for cars."

8803,170644,3,pakorrer,10/08/2017,Good area € 4 day. centric for town and beach. It only has one drawback (my point of view) small squares and with inclination.
8803,170494,4,tim38,10/08/2017,"Close to a beautiful beach in a residential area, quiet and clean. Paid parking, free services."
8803,166018,4,Merchan,05/08/2017,"Good area near the town and a stone's throw from the beach, although the squares are a bit narrow. The baker stops by in the morning. It's €4 24 hours."

8803,142691,2,miticoarpege,12/06/2017,"I do not understand much enthusiasm for a simple paid park, even if inexpensive. It is not on the sea, indeed to access it you have to cross the road. It is all in slope in two directions and it is difficult to stabilize the camper. Just behind it there are houses with dogs that bark continuously. I've been there one night and I'm not going back. Two stars just because you can drain and water"
8803,136832,5,JMiguel,23/05/2017,"An unbeatable place, next to the beach. Fishing town with a lot of atmosphere in summer and Easter."

On the promenade next to the beach there are bathrooms, I suppose with services. I also suppose that in summer it will be saturated."

8803,27093,4,jackblueberry,28/09/2014,"2 nights on the road to Compostela, very quiet and the walk to the port by the path laid out by the sea is to be done."
8803,18171,3,Luc,12/07/2014,"All free is good. The service area is good. But as too often the pitches are materialized for cars then the motorhomes are cramped, The ground is steep and the holds forbidden by the regulation which prohibits the ""camping behavior""!"
8840,3281976,4,RJ,10/09/2023,"We found this area pleasant and quiet, for a price with electricity of €14.70. Very smiling campsite staff. Parking on grass is flat. the services are somewhat outdated, but they do the job..."
8840,3262177,3,LestoRunner,05/09/2023,Quiet and clean place with all services. The sea 500 meters away. The only negative point is that there isn't a bar or entertainment venue nearby.
8840,3202118,4,Jzeus,22/08/2023,"Area with all services, €10 without light, with light €15. The receptionist let us go to the beach through the campsite when going with children. If there isn't that one to go to the beach, the path is short, almost the same as for the campsite."

8840,3061393,3,sespunes,02/08/2023,"Quite flat area, belonging to the campsite that is just ahead. There is no option to use the services of the campsite. About 20 places without delimiting. The bad thing is not that you pay €10, but that for this price the emptying and filling facilities are deplorable. So much so that we leave without filling."
8840,2821899,1,Dicke_Peter,05/06/2023,"only a parking space on a meadow for 10 €. The toilets opposite on the campsite may not be used, although they are the same provider. If you want a toilet, you have to go to the campsite opposite for €25 a night."

8840,2277162,3,mariuca,21/08/2022,"The very pleasant environment, beautiful walking routes, Luanco very close walking, very good restaurants nearby. The only unbearable thing is the noise all day from the motocross circuit. it's hell"
8840,2271622,1,bekampervan,20/08/2022,"I would not go back! There are more places to sleep and without paying! at night, as it is a parking lot where there are cars, there was a bottle and at 8 in the morning you can leave since the noise of the motorcycles is a horror, there is a circuit right next to it, the only good thing is the access to the campsite and that it has lawn and you can take out the awning and the tables."
8840,2247149,2,Ruizfrederick,16/08/2022,"Dream place until the motorcycles woke us up in the morning, it seems that there is a cross circuit next to it. what a noise!!! Electricity only for 8 motorhomes."
8840,2232773,2,HotelRodinhas,13/08/2022,"Little recommended. Area for AC, in the parking lot of the campsite. Places not delimited, some have more sites and others less. You can not use camping services, bathrooms or bar-shop (you have to go around the outside of the campsite). Excessive price for what it offers."

8840,2215999,3,hectorom21,11/08/2022,"area without more, with drains and water. 600m from the beach. We really didn't like the beach (a lot of decomposing seaweed, rock...) a cool green area next to the beach with a parking area that I've seen where several motorhomes have slept, perhaps a good alternative."
8840,2198958,1,ElisaFalchini,08/08/2022,Yesterday (07/08) unfortunately there was blaring music on the nearby beach which went on all night and prevented us from sleeping: we escaped in the middle of the night! S It seems that the music will repeat for all nights this week until 08/15.

8840,2164218,2,covita,02/08/2022,"area outside the campsite that belongs to the campsite parking. They charge 10 euros and separate electricity for 5 euros plus I asked the girl at the campsite who checks you out, since I have a campervan and I don't have a bathroom, if we could use the ones at the campsite even if we paid something more and she refused... ..you won't think I'm going to pee in a bottle... but come on they'll know that's why I give you two ⭐⭐"
8840,2142021,4,bdepablo,29/07/2022,"Very comfortable grass area and good services. Next to the beach, the town is not much and it is far away. Ideal if you want to remove awning and tables. 10 euros without light."

We arrived on Thursday and the campsite only opens on Friday around 3:30 p.m. Suddenly no water, no electricity and no laundry and on Friday at the beginning of the afternoon we decamped for lack of satisfactory service. We wonder why there is a person at the reception when she cannot intervene. Weird ! Otherwise the area is nice."
8840,1736320,5,Rasjahcor,18/01/2022,"After kicking all the spots in the area and seeing that there was no fence or sign, we got into it. We called the campsite phone and a very kind girl told us that we could spend the night in the area for free, without having access to services and at our own risk since the campsite is closed. Night alone and calm a ten and very grateful! The best option around here."

The great area: you have a few minutes on foot to Bañugués beach, there are recreational areas, a walking path and the recommended La Ponderosa restaurant. Important: Dogs are allowed. The only downside: to go down to the beach you cannot cross the campsite, not even to go to the supermarket, you have to go around the facilities. Something strange being the area of the same campsite."
8840,1434415,2,vicenpito,10/08/2021,"They treat us like second-class customers, they have not let us go down to the beach through the campsite, they have forced us to go around it. It says that there is wifi, but it is not true. The campsites still do not see the business of the ac, a shame ..."

8840,995805,4,ElviraLara,23/08/2020,Parking in front of the campsite. We paid 10 euros to be able to spend the night and camp but without electricity. There is an option with electricity for 15 euros. We were calm and we were able to camp without a problem but 10 euros seems a bit expensive just for staying overnight.
8840,985897,4,IMF,20/08/2020,"Very spacious, grass floor, about 200 meters from the beach and next to several restaurants (one of them camping, with a very basic supermarket) for € 15 with electricity and water changes, something close to the road and you can hear cars, better go to the back of the area, it is a field of the camping itself in which you have to register, but if you can access the restaurant and the supermarket by going around the back of the camping that gives access to the beach, with wifi, when comping you cannot access to use their facilities, you can take out tables and chairs and put the awning."

I think we should be able to sleep there."
8840,687976,4,mitch83,12/09/2019,Great place. The person who talks about bridge at 3.5 m is wrong place (he is in Candas). By cons no height limited here. See Faro de Penas 7 km.

I think something expensive with light, but it is one of the few in Asturias. Let's see if the municipalities begin to Europeanize with the areas of motor homes."

8915,2952080,4,Josler,11/07/2023,We slept here three nights since the location is perfect since it's next to the lovely beach. It's impossible to find a spot in daytime! Hard to find a flat spot but manageable. The shower at the beach didn't work at all the time we were here. Gets very noisy in the morning. Would recommend though!

Too bad we had to leave our pitch at 1am because of a music festival organized by the pool next door. the ""music"" was unbearable. Otherwise for 3 € it is a very good value for money."

9269,2803508,4,eagleroad,30/05/2023,"Good motorhome area. A recommendation for parking: Arrive during the day because the places ""at the top"" require maneuvering and you have a risk of rubbing under the motorhome. Otherwise, at night, park ""down"" towards the Douro and do the maneuver the next day. Have a good stay !"

At least on the weekend. Recommended."

Although there are several roads and bridges around, quiet night without aggressive noise. The only downside for me is that the places are not very wide so we are not stuck to each other.

In the night a lot of barking dogs, in the early morning traffic. It is good for 1 night. It has room for 30 with electricity, 3 euros. But there were 52 campers, downstairs without power. It is not clear whether this will be tolerated."

9269,1805297,5,Volkeryuma,03/04/2022,"A special place with a wonderful view of the Douro River due to the terraced layout of the pitches on the hillside. Everything is there that you need as a mobile home owner, except for the sanitary facilities. It only costs €3 (regardless of whether you use electricity or not). The pitches on the slope take a bit of getting used to due to the continuous floor grid and the inclined plane."

9269,1765107,5,lauranuman,24/02/2022,"Great parking! All parking spots have their own electricity and water supply. If you don’t need electricity, you can better park down at the river and use the service area of this parking free of charge. Good thing about paying 3€ a night: you are assured of your spot when you come back after a day away and you’re further away from the stray dogs that live next to the river."

Swimming pool right next to it (5 € adult 3 € -15 years old). 2 full service areas accessible free of charge. No worries about traffic noise and let's ignore the bad luck of the people who come to chat in the car park.
9269,1325059,5,DanielAlegria,14/07/2021,"Excellent park for overnight stays. very good location. next to the river, swimming pool and close to the city. A good bike path that passes by. It is a pity that some caravanists carry out the disposal of dirty water in the parking place, which causes it to run off through the runoff that runs through all the parking lots (lack of civility)."
9269,1293745,5,carmenmuc,03/07/2021,"Fantastic place! Fantastic view of the Douro and Sandemann opposite. Small green strips in front of the parking spaces, where you can sit nicely in the shade of the trees. We liked it so much that we stayed longer than planned. The disposal was a bit inconvenient for us because we have a floor outlet. We then disposed of it at the next place. € 3 with electricity is great! And it was quiet too. Although there are no wet rooms, I give 5 stars for this view and green strip! Cheaper and better (legally) on the Douro should be difficult"

There is the paid space around 3 euros the night, including electricity, own water and supply. The fee has to be paid at the bar. Yellow house at the swimming pool. The seats are good, but not suitable for people sensitive to noise. Through the swimming pool is already a noise level, it is often played loud music. You also get traffic through the bridges. View of the Douro is available. Below the pitch is still a large meadow. Motorhomes are still tolerated there. But everything is full at the weekend. This area is also suitable for larger vehicles.

Ideally located for further exploring of the Douro valley by train, boat or bus."
9269,399862,3,fbouz,27/10/2018,"It's very good at the facilities level. But we will not stay because of the smells, I have a nose too sensitive, I know, and more at that time everyone burns his plants and other, the lack of wind, the encaissement of the valley and the smell of gas oil, will be right of my objectivity."
9269,399100,5,cassidje,26/10/2018,A very practical and cheap motorhome area. We took the train to Pinhao ...
9269,397559,5,DKKLS,22/10/2018,"Wonderful place for three euros, electricity water and garbage. For some services are free, a shame not want to pay three euros a day or everything is down the same scream, the good spirit camper is lost and know how to live. Area worth the trip, we stayed for three nights"
9269,394648,5,SHORTYGEORGE,17/10/2018,"Well laid out aire, but very popular. We arrived at about 17:00 and there were only two places left from the 30 or so available. Parking costs €3, but you get free electricity. There is plenty of additional parking next to the aire, and two dedicated service points inside the aire for use by non ‘residents’. But free hook up decided it for us! Great view of the river Douro too. It was a bit noisy from the nearby bus parking, and the parking slots are very close to each other."
9269,391924,4,jnad,12/10/2018,"Free service air so top for draining and refilling water, but beware, we touched the 2 times because it is sloping. We were then sleeping in a large field just down the area where we were a dozen camper. Flat ground in front of the Douro where we could leave the tables without worries."

9269,380808,5,megandian,23/09/2018,"We booked in for 1 night and stayed for 4. Everything is so handy. We took the train (10 mins walk) up the Douro Valley and got off at Tua where there is a good restaurant. Caught the train back 2 hours later. Also took the Inter Regional train to Porto, a 2 hour trip, right into the central station at Sao Bento and the heart of the old city. Highly recommend."

Can highly recommend ‘Sus’ restaurant in the old train sheds, 3 mins walk from the parking area - for a special dinner treat. Well built and convenient, but having the waste water channels directly beneath you isn’t ideal, but at the same time didn’t really bother us. The pool is lovely and great if you’re there in summer. Make sure you cross the footbridge for panoramic views of the Douro."
9269,348186,5,jerovega7,22/08/2018,"After my last visit, two years ago, I still think that one of the best areas I have visited, with filling and emptying services, without moving the motorhome. You only need a minimum of maintenance, since for the light you need a key, for the water it would also be interesting the same system, so no people will be installed outside the camp or use the water to wash."
9269,334009,5,Jeandab22,14/08/2018,"Service area as we would like to find in France. Parking, water, electricity (16A), emptying all wastewater for 3 euros. Thank you to the municipality."

9269,311575,4,Monique29460,02/08/2018,"The parking is free, only the electrical connection is paid 3h for 24h. It is relatively noisy, a lot of passage day and night. A pedestrian path gives access to the city where there are many shops and restaurants. For a day and a night, it's fine. The swimming pool at the end of the car park allows you to cool down (4 euros for the adult entrance). The places are well defined and sufficiently large."

It is on the outskirts of the town but you can walk. It is prepared for ac and others. We saw a tourist boat that goes by the river, but due to the bad weather that we had, we did not have the opportunity to go up. So we can not say how much the return is worth."

Train and Bus station 5 min walk away. Tourist river cruises in season. Some fantastic cycling if you don't mind some hills. Only downside is early morning noise from local workers congregating close behind the MoHo parking. Always felt safe though.

It is next to the center, it is the good thing that it has."
9359,1514875,1,hecpat,26/08/2021,Very poorly enabled area. They park many vehicles that make it very difficult to maneuver if you go with AC. We didn't even try to test the tap.
9359,1504759,3,Albalo,24/08/2021,"Very small area at the foot of Tui, paved, in a garden area and next to a not very busy road. We stayed one night, we were passing through but the next day we visited Tui, very beautiful. The drain for water is difficult to see especially if it is at night but it is on the lawn next to a bush. There is also a fountain and a picnic table."
9359,1460359,3,Aliciagarebo,15/08/2021,"We have slept here and without problems, it is true that it is small, but I thank the city council that we have an area to fill and empty both gray and black and free. The black hole is a pipe hole that is exposed. Do not confuse it with the sewers next to it."
9359,1437039,1,leopoldoalvarez,10/08/2021,"Inappropriate place, very shabby services, fits 4 or 5 cars, but there is a supermarket on the sidewalk, and many customers park in the area. Much hype with ""ancient capital of the kingdom of Galicia"", but they could not have enabled a worse place."
9359,1415289,2,willyfognomada,06/08/2021,"Small 3-seater area, the services are barely visible, but it has gray castings (a grid on the ground), blacks (a hatch next to the grass) and a fountain-type tap a few meters away. To sleep a lot of road noise, although green areas with picnic tables / chairs. It is close to the center, very nice Tui."
9359,1377684,2,ezuelia,29/07/2021,"We do not use the water intake or the drains, therefore I do not know its state, but it is a good place to stop and visit the very interesting town of Tuy."
9359,1348412,1,javacasm,21/07/2021,"There is no service, nor water, to change the water. not worth stopping."
9359,1335136,3,sevorane,18/07/2021,"The area itself is small, only three spaces, although you could also park online in a couple of other places. The toilet, indeed there is a hole with a pipe on one side, but we have to fill and empty and it is appreciated. The center of town 10 minutes walk, and a commercial area 3 by car where you can park your car well."
9359,1290703,3,eonate,02/07/2021,"It is a functional area. What is shameful is that there are companions of this world who empty the black in a sewer destined for the gray. And also leave traces of feces and paper on the rack. There is a hole 5 m from the sewer, which is intended for black women. Then we complain that they don't like us in many places. Let's take care of the areas and the environment."
9359,1266762,3,Paul_and_friends,20/06/2021,"Little privacy, but still a nice picnic area with 3 parking spaces reserved for Womos. There is a well for drinking water but no disposal. Actually, this place should only be marked as a parking lot."
9359,1156181,5,lescampingscoeurs,23/03/2021,"Very functional area, everything works at 22.03 small precision, the large grid in the middle is for gray water. the toilet cassette is on the edge of the sidewalk, see photo !!! thank you to the municipality"

9359,1001601,4,ndavila,25/08/2020,"It fulfills its function. You can spend the night 48 hours maximum, parking for vehicles is prohibited. Picnic table and small garden. Fountain with push button drinking water. Grid to drain gray water and a hole on one side to drain black water. Nice views."
9359,971996,1,Kutxi,17/08/2020,"There is a panel that clearly says that parking is prohibited. The only tap there is, surely it is used to clean the cassettes, so I do not recommend carrying water here"
9359,969212,3,LaPitufina,16/08/2020,"It is a small area for few places. We parked there to visit the city. We use the services of the area, to load and unload without problems."
9359,955674,2,blor,12/08/2020,"Very noisy from the people who gather in the adjacent one. yes, in 5 minutes you are in the center. Unhelpful AC services."
9359,943169,1,Catalina19,09/08/2020,"good area to download and fill. black are discharged into a small uncovered sewer, gray into a sewer, and water is taken from the threaded fountain. not a good area to spend the night, very small and on the road."
9359,751738,3,aldipa,09/12/2019,"The tap already has a thread, the area is quite small and small. I just unload and load. For unloading of dirty ones and it is good to know that the sewer is small."

9359,706521,3,grek,27/09/2019,Small space in picturesque place. Water drainage impractical. Near the center. And about two streets from the Tui bridge. I practice for a night on the way to Portugal.
9359,672673,2,euproctus,01/09/2019,"Poor services, emptying is a hole next to a square. water from a fountain and near the village"

9359,531605,2,condormac,28/06/2019,They fit 6 motorhomes well parked. very basic services. With a little electrical tape you can hook a hose. When we arrived there were 2 badly parked and we had to stay a bit lower on the bridge. It's quiet. A person lives under the bridge. At first we got pissed but do not mess with anyone.
9359,468594,3,Metzi,26/04/2019,Disposal not clarified. Fresh water tank but available. Pitch for 3 small mobile
9359,459200,1,okcorral,19/04/2019,The access is very difficult for a large ac. Very complicated maneuvers. The water is a source of those of the whole life and the draining of black a sewage system. I do not recommend it.
9359,450470,1,delfsupertramp,07/04/2019,Access possible. two buses block the road because there is a supermarket next to cheap products. it must be very noisy it does not dream at all
9359,393607,1,Angelet,14/10/2018,"Only for an emergency, you have to enter the ass, no more than 5 or 6 Acs, no thread to catch water, empty in the middle of the street and with aim to not run the gray water and black without a lid or anything uffff"
9359,323928,3,joshi_es,09/08/2018,"The area is small. But enough to fill and empty waters. A small park for picnics is not bad at all. It is next to the road, but not very noisy. Some comments in this area are negative, but it is not so bad. I think the area is correct. Right now we are 7 vehicles."
9359,321452,1,anaisma,08/08/2018,"A very small area, a single entrance and exit which makes the maneuvers difficult. Only 3 places, but they get more. Ideal for a short stop, it is next to the road, although it decreases the traffic at night, not suitable for light dreams. Near the historic center, beautiful, walk along the river and at the end crossing a bridge, Valença a Portuguese village surrounded by walls."
9359,313654,3,Javicamo,04/08/2018,"It is well located and next to supermarket. To improve the infrastructure. The emptying of blacks is third world and the water intake needs an adapter that is not the one normally used. They should put a universal tap. The emptying of grays is a culvert on the ground and you have to have aim so that it is not saved from the outside. Although it is a municipal initiative that is appreciated, needs improvements. The night very quiet."
9359,283147,5,Manu_gbm,08/07/2018,He sleeps well
9359,264085,3,montez,05/06/2018,"The tap has no thread, it has to be cut, and the place to empty the cassette is not marked, it is covered with a slab of stone. But pulling on the head, it has all the services."

9359,208654,3,Claudeliliane,02/11/2017,Near the road but not very noisy
9359,207971,2,laluisa,31/10/2017,"Area for emptying and little else, fountain without tap and the emptying of WC is a shabby hole in the ground and if you fit 3 cars it is a miracle, since you park buses, trucks, cars ..."
9359,205029,1,missa33,22/10/2017,Very small area. Forbidden at +3.5 tons.
9359,189799,2,centrodelsur,04/09/2017,Thanks to the city council for putting it. We only use it for parking to walk around the city and buy at the adjacent supermarket. It's small and it's not clean
9359,178793,3,Kikemer,18/08/2017,"Drained poti, gray and water filled pjo large thread"
9359,178790,2,Kikemer,18/08/2017,"We did not sleep there but we went to refill water, and empty it. Refill water: the tap is wide-mouthed, with a push button. Empty gray: correct. I leave photo. Drained black: not signposted, is to pour the poti into the sewer directly. I leave a photo so you can find it easy"
9359,175815,4,momar,15/08/2017,"Noisy area during the day. Very small, better to get in the ass. Only three official sites, but can sleep up to 7 or 8 motorhomes. Better to arrive early because as the afternoon progresses it is completed. The tap has no thread but behind it there is a lid on which there is another tap with a thread underneath. Gray drain in the middle of the entrance."
9359,157669,1,steve.perre,24/07/2017,"Air to avoid, preferred the parking down the river more pleasant"
9359,149529,3,manuraid,09/07/2017,"I do not agree the least with what you put on the area. First thank the City Council of Tuy to have this type of initiatives. And then, the area is true that it is for three ac's. But it has spectacular views, chairs and picnic tables next to the lawn. You can walk to the village, just 200m. It has to download and it is true that the tap is a push button and it has no thread but I have mounted my adapter and my hose and I have recharged it in a plis. And it is also a bit noisy for the day since it is next to a main road. But at night you hear three or four passing cars."
9359,147251,2,Roberrr,01/07/2017,Basic area. good location to visit old town. to be close to the road is noisy and only has space for 3 cars. But thank the city of Tui this space to park.
9359,132654,4,luchin,02/05/2017,"It can be loaded and unloaded, the water tap has no thread and is a push button. Biena location To know the city of Tui."
9359,132568,5,LoretoIsmael,02/05/2017,Can be loaded and unloaded. Good for spending the night.
9359,128712,3,anapsi77,17/04/2017,"Basic area, the biggest difficulty is the tap that is without thread and width and push button. We put water with a bicycle camera. If there is a specific place for blacks, it is a hole in the ground next to the grass, not the grid of the grays. It is very close to the historic center."
9359,98848,2,santi1976,22/08/2016,Not a bad place to spend a night. Thank the people for this space. It is important to arrive early to get a spot.

9359,87439,2,willvy,31/07/2016,The site is an old curve in a road. The facilities are minimal.
9359,61147,3,F.L.Ortiz,18/12/2015,"Sitio tranquilo y seguro. At pocos minutos del centro urbano, del Casco Histórico and zona de tapeo. Cerca of the antigua aduana y del centenario puente internacional that a Tui con Valença do Minho (Portugal). El vaciado de grises, toilets and toilets of drinking water no está señalizado y es deficiente. Muy cerca del paseo fluvial. *** Quiet and safe site. A few minutes from the city center, the historic and tapas. Near the old customs house and the centenary international bridge that links Tui with Valença do Minho (Portugal). Drainage of gray water, WC and filling of drinking water are not marked out and in poor condition. Very close to the river."

9359,16973,2,Luc,18/06/2014,"3 places materialized on the ground, otherwise 6 or 7 possible. very noisy because near the road, and ban on holds, chairs, tables etc .. good for eating, not good for sleeping."
9385,3282675,3,rk12,10/09/2023,"campsite with all facilities, terrace with music performance and bar, located next to a main road, which you can hear well. not expensive for what it is"
9385,3236285,2,CDRE,29/08/2023,"Not terrible, no pitch it's a mess, they let us register and enter in mid August when there was no real place, another motorhome at and the kindness to squeeze together so that we could park between it and a tent. The toilets are dirty and in very poor condition, the swimming pool is very dirty. But there is no choice in this area so we stayed there anyway."
9385,3222404,2,amandina14mara,26/08/2023,"To spend one night is fine, but not more than that, at least in high season. Very dirty bathrooms and there is literally no organization when it comes to campervan spaces. However, it is very close to the beach."
9385,3177821,2,titi6464,19/08/2023,"Okay, nothing good except the welcome at the reception, go your way"
9385,3177610,3,terraverde4x4,18/08/2023,"Reasonably priced park. With acceptable shadows and toilets. Close to the beach. Good service. The caravan supply store has many items at normal market prices, without being inflated. I advise you not to stay too close to the road, southeast side of the park, due to traffic noise at night. The pool looks big but I didn't get to try it."
9385,3173509,3,gwada0184,18/08/2023,"It's a bit casual… you have to find your place.. the plots are not delimited, in short, you find yourself surrounded by car tents.. a lot of dust. the reception staff are pleasant and speak French, lack of smile at the restaurant. Supermarket very limited in products. Restaurant outside. He helps out for 2/3 days to sleep."
9385,3173460,1,marila,18/08/2023,"campsite with anarchic investments, anarchic electricity connections, dirty toilets. good proximity to the sea."

9385,3127069,2,samiot,12/08/2023,"Campsite not great. I don't think he has any idea of the remaining places. Everyone poses as they feel. The electricity terminals are very far from certain locations and it is necessary to open the boxes to connect them. In the end, no one opened up to me. No lighting at night!"
9385,3111758,3,famdamgo,10/08/2023,Somewhat wild campsite everything but good with all the services and lively quite full in August but they did me the favor of letting me spend the night
9385,3096363,3,jraveiro,07/08/2023,"Park with plenty of space, has a Wing of good size. The toilets could have at least soap to wash your hands. They should try to organize more space for Caravans, AC and tents."
9385,3076127,1,MartinJacques,04/08/2023,"a little disappointed in relation to the price because sanitary facilities are not terrible, swimming pool is payable in addition and staff are not very smiling, but it helps out"
9385,3073706,2,tomdisco2,04/08/2023,"Sometimes I can't understand what some give 5 stars for, a place without any charm, fine dust constantly blowing into every crack. Sanitary facilities are ok. Pool is there and good, but that's it"
9385,3039081,4,kellysito,29/07/2023,"Old park but in good condition overall. Note that to take a shower, you first have to press a button corresponding to the shower cabin outside, and we have water for 7 minutes. Camping would be better organized by parcels, and not everything in bulk as it is at the moment."
9385,3038034,3,VeravdDungen,29/07/2023,choose your own place. this may cause close neighbors no problem for us. not much shade. 10 minutes walk beach. swimming pool not in. at least first day yes and second day no. showers have a piss jet. 7 minutes of hot water by pressing the button. red soft ground. a lot of dust due to drought now. stayed fine for 4 nights. plumbing is a bit old.
9385,3031466,3,DASIVABEATRICE,27/07/2023,"nice campsite, but there is no defined place so we get on as we can. the trees are not maintained. lots of dead branches. we paid 25 euros per night with electricity, 2 adults and a small dog. very functional to fill and empty the CC."
9385,2971974,4,dasafru,16/07/2023,"camping well located, good pool and it is clean. points against little shade and somewhat old infrastructure."
9385,2953331,4,U.Do,12/07/2023,"Top price-performance ratio (21.50 euros without electricity), shady right on the street, too loud because of the manhole cover, look for a place inside. Beach 1km, no problem with dogs on the beach. Once the Benagil cave in 12km, mobile homes up to 6m can park in the parking lot before 8am, otherwise it will be too full. Kayak 30 euros (rent at the very bottom, only there 1.5 hours instead of 1!), awesome at 8:30 a.m., too crowded after that"
9385,2902317,2,caravanarodriguez,28/06/2023,"It is small and cozy, the food in the restaurant is delicious. But there is not enough light for a motorhome, they only give 10 amps and the power went out all night, which made the fridge not work well. Otherwise the bathrooms are acceptable."
9385,2871974,3,TrundleOn,19/06/2023,"Could be a 5-star campsite if the disgusting services were improved and the old dilapidated caravans removed.  Staff are pleasant, well organised and professional. Grounds for motorhomes are spacious, easy to access, quite flat and surrounded by pine. Great access to town. Fabulois onsite camping shop. Clean up the services and be the best that you can be."
9385,2863638,2,fpan,17/06/2023,"campsite with very little shade and maintenance at the level of the possible pitches. it is very big but you have to turn for a long time to find a place that is more or less drinkable. no hot water in the toilets. points: the friendly welcome and the large free swimming pool (5€ from July 1st), possibility of booking a visit of the coast and the caves by boat which is really worth it."
9385,2827957,5,SolarJoe,07/06/2023,"We really liked the campsite. There was still a lot left. We had a large space to ourselves (free choice of space, no defined plots) Sanitary facilities were clean. Reception friendly. Great value for money, with one of the cheapest pitches in the Algarve. Beach 10 minutes away. From here you can do many activities such as a boat tour through the caves."
9385,2824164,2,Haddock4485,05/06/2023,"Dilapidated campsite one day out of two cold showers at the bottom of the campsite. None worked. Places poorly marked out. Wifi unstable, but close to town and beaches. The road below the campsite is very noisy. Its price is a little high for the services offered. 17 € electricity included. The toilets are very clean though."
9385,2772801,3,rheos,21/05/2023,"Sanitary older, clean but unfortunately partly defective. Overall, maintenance seems to be of little importance. But there are always enough functioning showers etc. Currently only about 1/3 full and lots of great places. Extremely cheap: 11 € 2 pers. Bus. At that price, of course, there is no money left for repairs. The road on the north side is very noisy in the evenings due to posers (cars and motorbikes)."
9385,2760458,3,joelponpon,18/05/2023,correct campsite old facilities but maintained. €16 Camping car 2 pax 1 dog electricity. Long reception and departure formalities. Pretty beach with visit to the caves by boat for 25 €. pitches not delimited everyone places themselves where they want hence the difficulties to leave.
9385,2758676,3,Chris032512,18/05/2023,"Huge campsite with little shade, placement to choose but not easy to find a flat spot that is not in full sun. Very busy road at the bottom, prefer the top at the bottom of the campsite (but the water in the toilets is cold there, hot water in the block towards the entrance). Swimming pool closed, grocery store closed. Beach and town 10/15 minutes walk. Inexpensive so good value for money for me"
9385,2752418,1,FranzFranke,15/05/2023,One star only for free seating and good WiFi. Regarding the previous complaints: Back to the 80s!! Danger of sandstorm in gusts of wind. It seems that building new bungalows/mobile homes is more important than investing in the infrastructure of the facilities and the site.
9385,2742565,4,bengi69,11/05/2023,"Friendly campsite, 10min. Walk to the beach. Test showers first, some work, others only work with cold water. Otherwise clean."
9385,2722179,4,VanlifersOnTour,04/05/2023,"Campsite 10 minutes from the center and the beach, dented pitches and some in the shade (not easy to find a comfortable spot), sanitary facilities okay (shower time limited to 7 minutes for women) Swimming pool currently closed. Very good value for money."
9385,2720847,3,ZairaundFrank,03/05/2023,"Nice place with older but clean sanitary facilities. Unfortunately, the free choice of space without divisions tempts some to occupy oversized areas without really needing them. Spectacular cuisine in the restaurant, from Portuguese down-to-earth to steak on a hot stone."

9385,2684801,4,MiriamCrivelli,21/04/2023,"Good cheap campsite, €15.50 a day with an ACSI card. Some toilet blocks are very old, others a little better but clean enough. Less than 10 minutes on foot you will find the sea with a long beach. Very quiet campsite. Super recommended the 1 hour boat trip, you will see amazing caves and crystal clear water."
9385,2655843,5,DD9QE,09/04/2023,"Despite all the negative reviews, the place is always good for a stopover or for a few days of relaxation. Anyone who takes a look will find a suitable place here. Find this casual standing, definitely better than being forced into narrow plots. In addition, the place is also very cheap for the great location.. so if you don't like the place, keep going!"
9385,2649579,2,coockie57,08/04/2023,"Large campsite. The campsite would have a lot of potential if it were better equipped. Everyone places themselves, with some chaotic and sloppy results. Plumbing deserves a solid refresh."
9385,2630746,3,Wastl95,30/03/2023,"Were standing here out of necessity because we had to have something repaired at Camping Technik Algarve. But the place was great and cheap. Plant however getting old and not the nicest, also many mosquitoes. You can walk to the beach in 10-15 minutes."
9385,2614144,5,MelInAVan,18/03/2023,"I stayed here for 2 nights. Very good campsite: correct sanitary facilities, lukewarm shower, location with a little shade. Within walking distance of the town center and the beach."
9385,2600647,3,samrobinson499,06/03/2023,"Good location and a very big site. Choose your own place is a bit of a lottery, especially to be near the EHU. Sanitary is a bit tired and showers not super warm but adequate, lovely town with nice bars and good beaches. Staff friendly and helpful"
9385,2594323,3,kat47,28/02/2023,"I put 3 for the location, at the motorhome parking level, the big bazaar, everyone gets on and takes the space they want, too bad for the others, reception, some people speak French I thank them but as they change, The bazaar, for the locations I reported it."
9385,2588153,5,PenJ,23/02/2023,"This site never fails to please. It has all the motorhome amenities, plenty of parking on uneven, sandy ground and shade if you want it. The shower block is cleaned regularly and there is plenty of hot water. A large open air pool, tasty, well priced food in the restaurant, a camping shop and friendly, English speaking staff. Pingo Doce is a short walk away as is the beach, what's not to like."

9385,2570529,3,familieHommes,06/02/2023,"on this campsite you can choose your own spot on different fields. very difficult with the trees, potholes and other long campers that take up a lot of space. 17.50 for our camper (7 meters) with two adults and 2 small children is reasonable. plumbing is old, shower is cold .. but luckily the plumbing is clean. Reception very friendly"
9385,2562846,2,Jojohexe,28/01/2023,Difficult to find a nice place because many campers occupy two to three places. Sanitary facilities old and not particularly clean. but to the beach and promenade are only about 10 minutes beautiful beach walk and coastal walk possible.

9385,2543778,2,PEcamperlife,06/01/2023,"There is always something 'nonsensical' about rules when we drive past here (in front of the camper shop) Now we wanted to empty the toilet and refill water; dare they ask 10 euros for it. A campsite rather, Canelas can do this for five. Then stood on the beach (no service) next to a nice beach tent with delicious food"
9385,2533956,1,Sedine,30/12/2022,"One star because the lady at the reception was nice. Toilets and showers old and smelly. Hardly possible to find a clean toilet. Garbage can in it, the toilet seat is missing, dirty. Free choice of place: hardly possible to find a suitable place because clotheslines are stretched over 3 places Access to the stream is too far away, Or furrows are scratched into the ground so that nobody comes close."
9385,2508273,5,AngieLu,28/11/2022,"I was in November almost 3 weeks in this place. The sanitary facilities are a bit old, but have always been super clean. The course's subsoil is red sand and there are many ruts through the terrain, which somewhat restricts the free choice of course. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Beach and shopping within walking distance. Saturday is market day in town."
9385,2497613,4,mikschak,16/11/2022,"Price performance is great. In November €11.5 per night without electricity and super fast WiFi. No plots, you stand where you want - sometimes between trees. Sanitary facilities (House 1) super clean, but getting a bit old. 15 minute walk to the beach which is quite nice. The place looks as if it were a tourist spot in the season, quite built up and not nice."
9385,2494486,4,turtur944,13/11/2022,"Super campsite (in November) for transit. The place is not nice but the campsite is good. For all types of vans/mobile homes/tents/caravans, but also suitable for giant ships!"

9385,2403147,3,pierren,25/09/2022,great place to take a tour of the coast by boat 10 people beautiful 1h30 is worth it. Super organic restaurant Marie and Oli's an excellent cataplana and a very warm welcome .... beautiful campsite swimming pool
9385,2387666,2,yvanick,20/09/2022,"Very very noisy between the buildings and the busy road impossible to sleep. Pitches are free under the eucalyptus, in September no problem. Very old but clean toilets. Pleasant staff speaking French, correct price."

9385,2376093,3,Zigotto34,16/09/2022,Well located for visiting and going to the beach. A LIDL to do these races not too far. €16 per night with electricity and ASCI card. Everyone chooses this place. Black and gray water drain station OK. Superb swimming pool. Provide wedges and a good length for an extension cord. Sanitary clean but old. Good overall.
9385,2374431,4,papou47,15/09/2022,"It is necessary to locate its location and ask at the reception the opening of the electricity terminal of the area, taken two pins, like many in Portugal"
9385,2363236,2,MafaldaAraujo,12/09/2022,"Very confusing campsite, poorly informed and unfriendly or helpful staff. Poorly organized space and poorly delimited spaces for each user."
9385,2317741,3,BraisOtero,29/08/2022,"a campsite crowded with people, it is not delimited, not very level, and the bathrooms... leave something to be desired, little toilet for so many people. The good thing is that it is close to the leisure area to take a walk at night, and the rest schedule is well respected"
9385,2311424,3,GemmaSS,28/08/2022,"We spent one night with our camper as we were looking for showers and washing machines and a bit of calm. We find a campsite with unlimited pitches, uneven and with few shades. The pool in the afternoon fills up quickly, it is quite small for the number of people it houses, especially the ""lawn"" area. It went well for us to spend that night with these services that we wanted."
9385,2273549,3,Chryst-Phil42,20/08/2022,"well located, close to the beach, restaurant, minimarket and very good motorhome service. but beware of the price... location price price per person electricity price swimming pool price... payment at the exit!"
9385,2272745,1,AnnaComarriu,20/08/2022,"Disastrous! The worst campsite we have ever been to. There is very poor organization, places are not defined and there are people who occupy 2 to 4 places. Most of the squares are uneven. The only thing we wanted was a hot shower and on top of that we had to take a shower with cold water....and to check out in the morning, more than 1 hour in line. We leave here very disappointed and pissed off."
9385,2217248,1,FamillePen07,11/08/2022,"Dusty place, cold shower, 37th for 3 adults and 2 children, EDF does not work! Location at our choice so I'll leave it to you to be a mess, swimming pool paying 4th per person, no soap in the toilet, the only positive point is that it is about 500m from the beach. I do not recommend. Very noisy."
9385,2196873,1,scje01,08/08/2022,The worst caming we have ever used. Checkout over an hour - horror. Sanitary facilities dirty and outdated. Surroundings sandy and extremely noisy.
9385,2196665,2,milena1996,08/08/2022,"We spent one night at this campsite and were very dissatisfied with the overall service! Long waiting times at check-out (more than 1 hour!), Electricity cannot be installed and uninstalled by yourself, we had to ask three times to install the electricity. The sanitary facilities are very old and in a desolate condition in terms of cleanliness. Absolutely not recommended!"
9385,2176327,3,DavidCanon,04/08/2022,"positive: availability, price and relatively close to the beach and the promenade with bars and shops. Negative: camping wherever you want without limitation between plots, slope of the terrain. old but ok bathrooms"
9385,2153905,4,Die4Wuerfel,31/07/2022,"We stay a total of 5 nights. Positive: nice big pool, close to the beach (1km and a really great beach, bars and restaurants), restaurant on site has good quality food for the price, lots of space and no fixed plots, nice helpful staff. Negative: Sanitary is getting old, but was cleaned regularly. Place is very sloping in some places, the red sand is everywhere and a bit louder from the street to the center on weekends, few children (as a play partner for our children)"

Pedestrian access door for greater proximity to the beach. 1 bar and 1 restaurant, with some dishes and various drinks. Medium bathrooms (you have to take paper and the hot water has to be activated outside the showers). Sink without hot water, which is not noticeable at least 1."
9385,2081084,4,PTis,16/07/2022,"The good: we arrived at midnight and they let us in anyway. Then they were not strict at all in the departure time. Very nice pool! The bad: it does not have lighting at night, the toilets have no paper and they do not notify you, the terrain is a bit uneven. Still, our experience was positive."
9385,2073566,5,Roadtrip123456,14/07/2022,"Large campsite, always has space, very uncomplicated, clean, great pool."
9385,2067394,1,onthegowithflow,13/07/2022,"Very expensive for what it is. We paid €23.25 for 1 night. The campsite does not look maintained. No clearly marked places and the pitches are extremely uneven. When you enter a camping site, you have to watch out for sometimes extreme potholes. The showers are not maintained. You also pay extra for swimming pool use. There is a motorhome technology shop, which is great!"
9385,2041517,2,Joost08,05/07/2022,"Old campsite, they mainly invest in cottages but the toilet blocks have not been maintained for years. The concept of free parking is very appealing but it is a very sandy, dirty field. We won't be back."
9385,1984643,4,S.Wegner,17/06/2022,"We stood here at night and explored the coast during the day. Pool is good but only open until 7pm. Shower 7 minutes, why even longer? And if so, press the button again. Plumbing is old but clean. At night there were always loud noises, not from the street (?). VW Bus, 2 people without electricity 16€/night."
9385,1978785,5,retirement,15/06/2022,"Last here 20 years ago and was a bit put of by the negative comments, but it was exactly as expected, fantastic pool, loads of space, clean, only a 7 minute shower but can be pressed a second time as I did.  I cant see why people moan, it even has 2 placed where you can clean your van. Perfect"
9385,1972077,4,laurentjuliette,12/06/2022,"Pleasant campsite, lots of room when we were there, nice open swimming pool, nice restaurant, we ate well there for a fair price. Their sangrias are amazing!! Health !"
9385,1946773,4,parkfornight1302,04/06/2022,"Although the campsite is dated and in some neglected areas, the facilities are clean. It is convenient for its proximity to the town and for making a base for visiting the wonderful beaches in the surrounding area. 3 large supermarkets within 1 km, the pedestrian promenade at 900 meters, wonderful with bars, shops and restaurants."

9385,1880829,4,Kerseboom,10/05/2022,A great place to empty and replenish everything. We found the beach a bit disappointing and a pity that the pool was not in use.
9385,1865740,3,44800,02/05/2022,"For a Frenchman, no numbered pitches seems odd. Most shower mixers are broken. You risk a burn or an icy shower. However price controlled."

9385,1758130,4,chrislene,17/02/2022,"Decent campsite apart from the unmarked pitches. A word of advice: do not take paid wifi at reception, it is free at the bar restaurant offering different dishes every day, good and cheap."

9385,1747343,4,gino85,04/02/2022,"Beautiful campsite but sanitary facilities a bit outdated. Free place to land. Very reasonably priced restaurant. Accessories for camper vans and repairs at the top. Please note that the ACSI card costs more if you do not have animals. For us, motorhome, two adults and electricity with ACSI costs €16.00 and without ACSI €14.50 per night. After threat from the police, we have to refund the difference."
9385,1741266,3,BunnyW,25/01/2022,"Helpful, welcoming staff. Well organised site. Washing up facilities clean but in need of modernising and no hot water.

9385,1733181,1,hellebia,13/01/2022,"Has nothing to do with the space itself, but somehow it does. Were customers at the camping shop. We stood there for 2-3 hours because we had problems with the water and repaired there to save us another trip. Were asked 5 times by the old man at the front desk when we were finally going to leave. Even though we were standing in the parking lot by the shop. Something unfriendly !!"

9385,1722359,3,AlanJulia,01/01/2022,Very very dated. In need of a complete refurb. The shower/toilet  blocks are just about fit for purpose. As usual lots of long termers taking up the best spots. Can’t say much more about it really. I would think twice about returning although it is better than Camping Canelas just up the road!

It shows that the campsite is old but for what we are looking for that we travel in AC it is more than enough, the campsite is huge, it has a lot of points of light and water everywhere, the bathrooms are old but in our case not need.

There is a very nice campsite with a better price 5 minutes away"

Better than being told to vacate the beach carpark in Pera at dawn by the GNR with 10mins notice. (was told). Couple of the shower blocks have been re-tiled but hot showers can be a bit hit and miss. Lots of shade and as the long term guests had left there was plenty of space.

The biggest problem is the stench, it gives you a headache even if you don't suffer from headaches, I don't know if it's because of the landfill you see before arriving or something else.

9427,2351925,3,Patouz,08/09/2022,Nice location by the sea. Very expensive campsite for the services offered (dirty sanitary facilities). Rude landlady. The nearby village is very pretty.
9427,2328408,4,macrieeric,01/09/2022,"we won't talk about camping but about help from CC with toilets, showers, toilets and sinks, it's enough but it would be perfect if the cleaning was done early in the morning after noon! otherwise great location on the seafront, very nice view, near the village 10 mins walk along the beach and on the other side a nice walk along the coast on foot or by bike, afterwards, you can't do everything have!"
9427,2300200,4,Pobolefa,25/08/2022,"Unique camping, different, you are at home. 10 meters from the beach, good treatment. with restaurant. You ask for some tapas and they bring them to your table in the carabana, cold beer... very good!!! no frills but correct !!!"

9427,1890364,1,Grunyis,14/05/2022,"We arrived and the owner said that we could park next to a car or in a plot next to the road (which would be very quiet). If we parked in front of the other car, we couldn't leave until everyone had left since they park one after the other. We parked by the road. One of the worst nights with the car. Cars all night, splashed stones… €25, a robbery."

The owner speaks French very well and was super accommodating. Be careful, the town located further away is lively even out of season and we heard the music until midnight...but after that no more noise, just the lapping of the sea."
9427,1855057,4,Cezarion,26/04/2022,"20 euros per night, with sanitary facilities and electricity. Few choices in the area, this is the only place we found. We are not very demanding, but the place seemed very good to us. Aperitif on the port and meal facing the sea. A refay"

The owner is very nice, speaks French. 10 minutes walk from the village, also perfect for the practice of Wing surfing and running (we were parked in front of a magnificent coastal path on which we were able to do our jogging). The village is also very pretty. A great find away from the crowds."
9427,1849039,3,martom40,23/04/2022,"Practical, sanitary facilities clean and in good condition, possibility of loading with clean water. The managers are welcoming and speak very good French. However, the place is not extraordinary, on the edge of a noisy road and overlooking a beach that is not extremely clean. On the other hand we could not have a pitch with a sea view, we would have had to book."

It has a great 4 seats, practically on the same beach. however the rest of the squares are really bad. has no gray service, a big flaw. black women have to be released in the bathroom and only at night. it hardly has services and has no shade. really the only good thing is its location next to the beach."

9427,591884,4,perichs,02/08/2019,"More than a campsite it can be said that it is an area of caravans, motorhomes and camper. It has toilets and showers, they are renovated. The best is the site because it is in front of the beach, and very close to the town of the port of the jungle. And the worst part is that you are very close to each other caravan, motorhome or camper. If we compare it with areas, it is expensive, it has no more."

All the grass is dead and no maintenance has been done for a long time, looks unsociable. The 'permanent residents' give you the feeling of being an intruder. The shop only sells unhealthy junk. The catering is fine. When we were there, it was probably understaffed that once."

One of the drawbacks that has bothered us the most, going with a dog, the loose dogs shitting and pissing in the rest of the plots and that neither their owners nor anyone from the campsite said anything, the rules are to be complied with The rest of us have our dogs controlled in our plot without disturbing the rest"

On Sunday (November 24th) we were woken up around 6 a.m. by setting up the market stalls. We were able to buy fresh fruit and vegetables next door.

Better to get as far as possible from the streets and the entrance: arriving at night, we were the only motorhome with just a few cars around. In the morning when the alarm clock the car park was full and we were surrounded by cars (and still no camper). On leaving, I saw that side arenas, there were some cars, I do not know if we can spend the night but it would be calmer and clearer = to see if possible the next passage. Pretty quiet town with a beautiful heritage."

Height limit is set overnight, this is 2.2 m. Open during the day and also passable with larger vehicles. For a whole day you pay about 9 euros. Beach showers, restroom, picnic tables and cafes nearby"
9898,2811543,1,SimoneEvelyne,02/06/2023,"The place is now closed, from June till september it is not possible and allowed to stay here with your campervan."
9898,2791045,5,lierniac,27/05/2023,"Nice place in front of the beach, with tables in the shade and two fountains next to it. There are two bars also in the parking lot where you can eat or have a drink."
9898,2766121,5,hannah339,20/05/2023,Super nice pitch. Directly at the sea. There is a water point and in the café you can kindly ask for the key to the toilets. There were about 20 other campers on site! Great to recommend
9898,2765359,5,LAreatza,19/05/2023,"We have been coming here for 20 years thanks to the Mendexa City Council! Lately there are unpleasant practices such as the occupation of several places, people showering outside the vehicles, taking tables and chairs outside, etc. This is not going to get us banned from this site, as is happening in many places, and we cannot come. Please! Let's respect! This is not a campsite!"
9898,2765228,5,Gotxi,19/05/2023,"Please!! If we want to keep this place, respect it: Don't occupy more than one square, don't take out the mahi, etc"

9898,2736982,4,Jujocamp,09/05/2023,"Parking just in front of the beach and 10min walk from the city center, close to a bar which closes at 1am. Barrier at 2.20m open on 8/05/23"
9898,2724977,4,famake,05/05/2023,"The portico being up, we spent a quiet night there. Very tight but normal location because not intended for vans and even less for cc. Toilets closed. Drinking water at the fountain. thank you city"
9898,2705458,5,Medy8,29/04/2023,"Great spot! Effectively barrier at 2.2m but open at the moment, parking directly on the beach, night to the sound of the waves, the top!"
9898,2690560,4,DannySteph,23/04/2023,"Parking lot with a wonderful view of the beach. We weren't there overnight, but it might be possible. There is a height limit, but it is open at the moment. We stood there with our 6 m camper for a walk. There are a few parking spaces for larger campers in the rear area. Also a small cafe is right in front of the beach."
9898,2674182,3,HeinMueckEU,16/04/2023,"Not suitable for over 6m. There are 2-3 places that are a little longer. Lots of locals park here, so please don't park across (it probably won't work anyway because it's too crowded). The 2.2m height barrier is probably between 01.10. and 31.05. open. The sign at the entrance to the car park says that this is the time without service (lifeguard). The barrier is on 16.04. at least not always open."
9898,2667721,4,retraite2019,13/04/2023,"Arrived in the evening in the rain, we slept well at this location around a few other vans. Some car comings and goings at first, but the night went well. Facing this beach, we took advantage the next day of the landscape of a stormy sea."
9898,2662797,4,busguy0815,11/04/2023,No season in April yet. Beach booth open until 9pm. Height limit still pushed to the side. Lots of rental cars here. Seems to be tolerated. But certainly not for long with the rush.
9898,2658872,5,jeremyalr,10/04/2023,I spent two nights there no problem :)
9898,2653828,5,andreaf772,09/04/2023,"Out of season there is no problem parking, it is free and there is room. Surely in summer it is more complicated. We have spent the night and it is incredible. Waking up in the morning with the beach in front of you is priceless. We recommend it 100%"
9898,2650462,4,Airin2012,08/04/2023,Good to spend one night. During the day it is a very crowded and lively beach. Difficult to find a space. There was a height gauge but it was open. At night it was filled with vans and motorhomes but by mid-morning they were just cars. The police passed several times and said nothing.
9898,2639849,5,AlbertixPuskas,04/04/2023,Beautiful site. Quiet and close to Lekeitio for a nice walk. Flat... perfect for sleeping listening to the sea.
9898,2622964,5,busmervan,24/03/2023,"Its beach is a spectacle, we slept very peacefully with the sound of the waves, the Police passed by several times and it was perfect, everyone in their cars and fires without camping, a good surfing atmosphere"
9898,2618214,5,xfarre66,21/03/2023,Very nice place on the beach. In previous reviews it puts height limited to 2.2m but in March without problems. The town is reached by walking in 15 minutes. Very quiet site.
9898,2614480,5,xfarre66,18/03/2023,Perfect place in front of the beach and next to the town. Very quiet in March. The height barrier is not active. I guess they play it in summer.
9898,2614036,5,WLMHoogendoorn,18/03/2023,"Beautiful spot on the stand. Enough space, even for longer campers. The height restriction was not there yet. Water available at the picnic benches. Toilets are still closed, but you can use them at the harbor. Quiet at night, lively during the day. Walking path to the island is nice, bare feet are recommended, then you have more grip!"
9898,2582833,5,Le_Fouts,19/02/2023,"great spot! Effectively barrier at 2.2m but open at the moment, parking directly on the beach, night to the sound of the waves, the top!"
9898,2545332,5,anazzz,07/01/2023,"We loved this place, we went in low season since we have been told that in high season it is impossible to park. there is a fountain just behind the parking lot. The town with the supermarkets is very close on foot and the people are charming. The only bad thing for my taste is that the sun does not shine because you have the mountain right behind you, so if you go with solar panels, the battery will run out a few days."
9898,2544402,5,LidiaDePradenaMelero,06/01/2023,"The spectacular site, I recommend it but out of season there is a height limit of 2.20."
9898,2524844,5,Laiabogunya,19/12/2022,"Beautiful place, very quiet! Next to the beach. We have been very satisfaced. Out of season there is no height limit. The town is beautiful and the people are very friendly. If you can, come!!"
9898,2503616,4,Japanner,23/11/2022,"2.2m barrier is gone during winter season. Plenty of free spaces. Police drove by in the evening without any problems. Local youth chills until around 22:00, very quite at night."
9898,2495589,5,Clem1393,14/11/2022,Superb quiet spot with magnificent views. Water fountain. Only downside the toilets closed in winter.
9898,2490662,4,clo65,11/11/2022,"Quiet spot with a beautiful view, only negative point no toilet out of season."
9898,2466556,4,TatiBG,28/10/2022,"We went in a good season because there was no prohibition for vehicles longer than 6 m. We arrived at night and there were free areas to park. The place to stay for several nights is very good, it is very quiet at night, it has a very cozy beach bar and the beach is beautiful. The distance to the center on foot is 20 min."
9898,2465455,5,StefanT5,27/10/2022,Nice place. Water from the well is drinkable. Toilets belonged to the bar on the beach and can be used when visiting. €2.5 a beer
9898,2465295,4,dorisorbrian,27/10/2022,"Toilets are shut in October. Wonderful location, perfect for a swim and walk out to the island. Be careful- the walkway can be very slippery! Some noise at night- seemed to be motorbikes going up and down the road- it leads nowhere, so who knows why."
9898,2464852,5,jeromefalc,27/10/2022,"Just a stop for the morning, but superb place facing a magnificent beach to sleep there. Do not hesitate to climb the peninsula for a beautiful view."
9898,2462626,5,lialrn,26/10/2022,"Wonderful place in the off-season. You can stand right on the beach, with a bit of luck even in the front row. It is very quiet, you only hear the sound of the sea. The barriers are open. The police are there regularly, but leave all WoMos where they are. There are two faucets by the picnic tables in the back, but no showers. At low tide you can explore the island on foot."
9898,2460345,5,sigiloue,24/10/2022,Stayed 1 night in converted kangoo. Free. Bins. Toilets locked. Couldn’t find any showers. Beautiful views! Quiet. Felt safe. Police come regularly.
9898,2455294,4,5nafu,21/10/2022,"in the low season the barrier is open, no height limit. 8m length were just not a problem. Police check regularly, mobile homes are left outside the spaces for the handicapped. When the weather is nice, the parking lot is often visited by locals and is then very narrow."
9898,2439002,5,JohannaChris,12/10/2022,Great view of the beautiful beach. Ideal for overnight and very quiet!
9898,2435362,5,AngelMarvera,10/10/2022,"Incredible parking in front of the sea, with restrooms, picnic area with drinking fountain, a beach bar with good food, you can see San Nicolás Island or go for tapas in Lequeito. The height limit is removed in low season as well as the Residents' R car park. My motorhome is almost 8m and 3.30m high and without any problem. Enjoy this beautiful place and always keep the spaces clean✌️"

9898,2196118,1,pfloresbb,08/08/2022,"Many limitations throughout the town, we have a van that is more than 5 long and more than 2.5 high, so it has been impossible to park in any of the car parks. So, after wasting time we have been left without seeing Lequeitio"

9898,1901600,5,Slyou33,20/05/2022,"Do not arrive too late and arm yourself with a little patience while waiting for a car to leave. But it's worth it. Public toilets closed. Shower on the beach not functional on this date. The night was calm, with the sound of the sea and a top view in the early morning."
9898,1875094,5,ClaraContreras,07/05/2022,"Out of season it is a luxury, right on the beach with a quiet picnic area, free and with no height limit. The places are not very big for motorhomes. There are restaurants around but without public services."

9898,1859393,5,jauloix,29/04/2022,"Small parking lot but with room to park. Pay attention to the size of the motorhome: we 6m was just right. Sea view, very pleasant. Barrier open Out of season, the police make rounds but say nothing. Great place."
9898,1836961,5,Mostapha,19/04/2022,"Easter 2022, we slept two nights, no problem, the bathrooms are closed, there are picnic areas, a very nice beach, about 500m away there is a children's playground, someone comes across and empties the pot there and it smells like it stinks."

9898,1811206,4,crespojsanz,08/04/2022,"Quiet parking, perhaps because we arrived out of season, there is a pub next door that is probably open in summer and crowds the area, disturbing the tranquility. Beautiful views of the mountains and the sea"
9898,1799626,5,katistoff,29/03/2022,Nice place and nice view. We also stood here at night 03/22 with 4 other campers without any problems. It wasn't noisy either (Monday to Tuesday). Showers and toilets are closed but the water dispensers work.

9898,1571962,3,ainarius,12/09/2021,"Very good place but only for the day. At the entrance there is a sign that says it is forbidden from 01:00 to 06:00, but as we saw more people we stayed. However at 00:50 the police came to tell us that we had to go."
9898,1528940,3,siofram,29/08/2021,"Arrived late and got a great spot next to the picnic tables at the end. Water taps at picnic tables perfect for cooking. Gorgeous beach, nice restaurants and nice atmosphere during the day. Only downside is that it is quite noisy at night- we were there on Saturday so extra loud.

9898,909646,5,eballano,29/07/2020,Magnificent place. Right in front of the sea. We arrive at 8pm (when the time is over) and it is quite quiet. You can stay parked until 1am and from 6am. They have dinner and breakfast very well in both beach bars. Paddle surf rental. From a walkway at low tide you reach a small island 100 m away. Highly recommended !!

9920,2642246,4,carlosfraguasa,05/04/2023,Very central parking but it is not possible to stay overnight. There are bouncers that help you park. To sleep it is best to go next to the river.
9920,2525977,2,robell,21/12/2022,"The area has been revamped and there is a further grass and walkway separating the narrow road from the river. Our MH is 7.2m and we just managed to squeeze in a space but the overhang at the back almost entirely blocked the walkway, so we left as we felt uneasy about it all. Also, if someone had parked opposite we would never have got out in the morning. Only suitable for vans of 5m I reckon."

10075,3030969,5,lloydh,27/07/2023,We arrived just after 8pm and the shop was shut so we couldn’t get connected to the electric which was a nuisance but not the end of the world. It was quiet and situated close to the motorway which was perfect for us on our route through Portugal spain and France

10075,2837118,3,MarianneA1,09/06/2023,"excellent CP, but the town itself (1.5 km walk) is not worth it. Almost everything is closed or half-decayed."

As it was cold, we packed up and left."
10075,2534112,4,LisaRe1228,30/12/2022,Good place for an overnight stop just after the border. Unfortunately we only had 3G which wasn't enough for our work so we had to keep driving. Remember to register your car for electronic tolls on Portugal's motorways.

The night was very quiet despite the proximity to the motorway. The highlight is the general store across the street that operates the parking space. Electricity must also be registered here."
10075,1018029,4,F.Miranda,31/08/2020,"Very quiet at night, good option low cost, to spend at least one night. Very safe, Portugal is much more safe than Spain. Try to stay here in the first Saturday of the month, because the little village transforms into a typical huge outdoor market, very nice. The train station is very beautiful in this city. The parking is ok. To eat we went to the restaurant “Stop Tir” very nice. Good one day stop!"

You have a parking area next to it with some unevenness but it can be corrected with the chocks. The first Saturday of every month, except in August, which is the 15th, a great market is set up worthy of seeing, with great offers of clothes, food and objects. If you come, you repeat."

Last year, the water was included in the 5 euros. Now you have to pay two euros even for a minimal supplement of full. On the other hand, as I saw it doing during my visit, taking five or six buckets of the same drinking water at the rinsing point of the cassettes to wash his camper is allowed. Anyway, given the attitude of the owners of this area, we must avoid leaving more money in his store on the other side of the road."
10075,117304,3,twowheels,31/12/2016,Ok for a one night stopover but 3 € for 4amp electricity isn't worth paying!

10114,1517792,2,kiquee,27/08/2021,"There are only 4 seats and you have to occupy the sidewalk to avoid leaving the lane. The floor of the water change area is made of permeable concrete and it only has a small manhole in the center, so if you want the water to fall directly, you have to leave the motorhome occupying one of the lanes. And the water taps are push-button and not adequate, since they are very attached to the wall."
10114,1489755,4,fwf83,21/08/2021,"We stood in this place with our campervan from Saturday to Sunday. With us only a handful of other campers and viiiiiiele (50?) Empty parking spaces.

However, it is also not a candidate for “Beautiful Living” - appropriately good."
10114,1466463,4,DaniAmigo,16/08/2021,"Fairly acceptable area. The train passes nearby but it does not cause much disturbance. At night there are no noises that prevent you from sleeping. Few spaces for AC but there are many totally empty car spaces. I don't know if parking is allowed in them.

10114,413335,5,Inakicm,10/12/2018,"If you are going to know Oviedo, it is one of the best areas. It is very well connected by train commutes to five minutes walking. Being close to the sports facilities you have the possibility to access the heated pool, gym, tennis court, paddle tennis, all year round for 3.5 € / day. There are 1 aa scarce 500 m to run through forest and make mountain bike. There is a large homemade cider house with a terrace and really interesting prices Casa Fran. In the access to the enclosure there are security cameras. Truly amazing"

10114,122677,3,xuandelaxata,12/03/2017,A good place to unload the waters for all those who live nearby.
10114,118330,3,RVQ,14/01/2017,Almost opposite the entrance there is a typical Asturian restaurant (llagar) where they make very good cider and dinner very well with reasonable prices. It's called Casa Fran. It has no sign on the facade. In summer it has a terrace. recommendable

10130,3138154,1,Dalonsju,13/08/2023,We stopped for water and the truth is that it did not invite anyone else to stay. The neighborhood a little left and the little green area that there was was full of condoms.
10130,3106955,3,park4nightcgarcor,09/08/2023,Thank you for helping us on our way ..easy access. Not highly recommended for sleeping. Few seats and a lot of train and highway noise!
10130,3070581,4,familycamperaventureros,03/08/2023,"We have had stops to fill and empty water and it has been phenomenal, thanks to the city council for this service and more city councils could do the same."
10130,2922048,4,jiadradan,04/07/2023,"Located in Avda de Asturias. Parking with services. Something uneven. With noise from FEVE and highway. Enough to sleep. Thanks to the City Council for this space. To put a hit, better move it to a less noisy place."
10130,2810429,3,EnyluPastor,01/06/2023,"Well, what was said in the description. 6 seats quite uneven. Of services, well to dry. The place chosen by the consistory quite bad. Feve and highway pass by. First of the trains around 7.10 and the last one around 22.40. Since Mieres is drenched in a fairly closed valley, the heat is immense. City center 5 minutes. Eye. My car with a ball hits the bottom going in and out."
10130,2644471,4,ibane,06/04/2023,good place to download and load water. thanks to Mieres for the services

10130,2294288,3,acampostru,24/08/2022,"Small area, but still, close to the center, quick access to shops, restaurants and bars, the area is in a noisy area, train tracks and highways, when we were there the entire area was under construction, everything needs to be improved. Thanks."
10130,2273894,3,SergioRP,20/08/2022,"Thanks to the Town Hall for the area. Even so, as they say, close to the highway and right next to the train tracks (I don't know if it happens at night, but when it does, the van shakes). Leaving Picos de Europa is a brutal contrast, and not for the better… empty/fill, visit Mieres and another place."
10130,2227608,2,Nosstromo5311,13/08/2022,Location could not be worse because of the highway and the train track. Too noisy although close to the center. Somewhat inclined with few seats. Still thanks for the area.
10130,2193262,3,Pulgarina,07/08/2022,"Very central area, with services. to sleep noisy Even so, thank the City Council for initiatives like this"
10130,2181064,1,JRM26,05/08/2022,"Disappointment. Mieres deserves a better area, for its people and its history! Area of 5 spaces, all sloping, a lot of noise from traffic and the nearby train, isolated location, and mediocre emptying/filling… still grateful to the city council, I insist it deserves a better area, it seems like a fix and nothing more!!!"
10130,2103537,4,ReneMartinez,21/07/2022,"Most of the squares with a bit of an incline, very central, right next to the train track. 7 seats. Loading and unloading of water All very simple but useful. Thank you Mieres."

10130,2059696,1,Aria.Luna,11/07/2022,"Very noisy, train track and highway right next to it, the only good thing is that it is central."
10130,2017266,3,mollotuttoevadoavivereincamper,28/06/2022,The town is nice and you can fill up with water and drain the toilet. No nautical and no gray water (cassette only). Few places to stop. Impossible to sleep due to the highway above and the train passing next to it (see last photo). Thanks anyway to the community for their good will.
10130,1990389,3,PACMAN825,19/06/2022,As a transit place it is fine. There is filling and emptying of water. At this time it is more of a motorhome parking lot than a place to spend the night. We spent the night with one more camper. Close to train and highway. It's not the quietest thing in the world but for the unexpected it's fine
10130,1895689,3,Jabalira,17/05/2022,"Free service area, we only use it for it back to León. Adjacent area of works and the fence they put left little space for the water discharge site. To sleep it must be a noisy place, since the Feve passes by."
10130,1836845,4,paularos,19/04/2022,"Very easy to get to, it is not the quietest place in the world, but if there is a downpour like it has happened to us... more than enough. with filling and emptying services."

10130,1815625,3,EOI,11/04/2022,"Thanks to the municipality of Mieres for the area, but if what they want is for us to stay and spend in the city and surroundings, they would have to find us a larger parking lot for our home vehicles and for us to rest. Noisy."
10130,1791503,3,luismi-izq,22/03/2022,"Poor but works well for water change. It has a good cider house on the corner. Access is correct even for large caravans, the only bad thing is the last stretch of road."
10130,1776534,3,ogt,07/03/2022,it's nice that the place exist. just that. very noisy
10130,1703889,3,david_ads,05/12/2021,"It is appreciated that they enable spaces for Ac and with services... the bad thing is the highway, that you hear the cars and the train we do not know about. Then we had bad luck that they started trimming the trees with a chainsaw (on a Sunday)"
10130,1506844,3,ibanolga,24/08/2021,Ideal to discharge black and gray water and fill with water .. sleep the truth q no. Anyway Thanks to the City Council of meires For enabling such a place ..
10130,1465595,3,cifus,16/08/2021,"Thanks to the council of Mieres, for enabling a place to empty, fill, park and sleep. We have an AC of 7.30 with a ball, and since it has a bit of a speed bump we hit to get in and out. We don't even think about it to sleep because we have a little girl and she's stuck to the train tracks and then the highway."
10130,1391451,4,LaCaravanista,01/08/2021,"Free and clean filling and emptying services. Area next to the highway. Nice town to take a walk and have good cider and eat in the Plaza de Requejo. We recommend Mercado de la Plaza de Abastos on Sundays. Many bars to have a drink. Good drinks are served in the Rodapié, in the Plaza del Ayto. Municipality with many possibilities of hiking trails. Go to the Tourist Office."
10130,1338680,3,sofines,18/07/2021,"Near the highway for loading and unloading, the scarce and sloping parking spaces, so we have slept in the dirt parking lot behind that is flatter. You can hear the traffic of cars a bit but if you are not a gourmand you can rest well."
10130,1277733,3,jorgeaz84,26/06/2021,"Ugly place and attached to the highway, it is necessary to sleep with earplugs. Even so, it is a good stop en route and with good filling and emptying services."
10130,1276170,5,neumoultra,25/06/2021,"I put five stars because everything that is a place for us is good, it is not the best place to sleep but in the absence of bread, they are good cakes, the town one more to walk and have a drink or eat a good fabada in the town hall like we have done"
10130,1237564,3,mafo111,05/06/2021,"Good area to visit the town of Mieres, good area to spend the night somewhat noisy next to the highway but good with ear plugs without problems the only defect that I put is that it is a little inclined but good without more. Also comment that we had a wonderful meal of a good stew at La Llera restaurant .... impressive."
10130,1204603,4,marsuma7,18/05/2021,"The place is ugly, but with easy access from the highway. Fairly level squares although not perfect. The service area is one of the best I have seen. Thanks to the city council for the good maintenance."
10130,1203571,4,HooLee,17/05/2021,"For loading and unloading the location is very good, next to the highway, clean area, good water pressure and level squares. To spend the night it is not the most ideal, because being next to the road and the train tracks there is a lot of noise, but for the rest it is very good."
10130,1004143,5,CampervanT5,26/08/2020,"In general, people's scores are very low but I give it 5 stars because it is super fast to access from the highway to be able to empty and refill. Obviously you won't sleep there, but the city doesn't have anything special to spend the night either. Water outlet with good pressure and everything super clean. Those who rate 2-3 stars really haven't been to the coastal areas these summer days ..."
10130,971618,2,carlosmpino,16/08/2020,"Good for loading and unloading, nothing more ... very noisy and ugly, between the train tracks and the highway. The area is appreciated, but the choice of the enclave was not at all successful, I'm afraid."
10130,940155,2,manumari,08/08/2020,Noisy
10130,940143,2,willvy,08/08/2020,Area very close to the highway and the train tracks. Lots of noises and somewhat uneven area but with the possibility of using chocks.
10130,926163,3,Mamenaminaya,03/08/2020,"Perfect for loading / unloading services, but the noise of the train makes it impossible for us to stay the night. The tracks are attached to the area."
10130,899087,3,Burgaillo,26/07/2020,"Free filling and emptying area. The train passes by, loud and small. To empty it is perfect but little else."
10130,883800,4,Juanmavan,20/07/2020,Free emptying and filling of water. I did not get to sleep since I was only passing through.
10130,874562,3,urdaburu,17/07/2020,Very urban and noisy area. We couldn't find a place.
10130,850947,4,sanfermen,05/07/2020,"Free water and emptying. Chocks are not necessary, and although the train makes noise during the day, it does not work at night. We slept very well."
10130,526155,3,angelbcn,23/06/2019,Horrifying. It is appreciated that areas for motorhomes are made but the one who devised the location of this insurance that in life has been asleep in a CA. Àrea under the highway with much noise and the rather ugly environment.
10130,459120,4,Nievesherne,19/04/2019,"Good site for emptying and loading of water for free. But not recommended for overnight, right next to the highway."
10130,418807,3,ukelele,01/01/2019,Enough to make a night. Very close to the highway and the train tracks
10130,219181,3,Queixas,17/01/2018,Noisy at night due to the proximity of the highway and the railway line. Congratulations to the Council of Mieres for having an area.
10130,114992,2,cgmacher,26/11/2016,"small place zww. busy street (Avenida Asturias) and railway area - approx. GPS-Pos. 43.25161, -5.78033"
10130,63145,3,maciusutu,31/01/2016,"Perfect area to load and empty for the location you have to the A-66. On the contrary, not very recommendable for the overnight stay due to the approach to the highway. But a 10 to the municipality of Mieres."
10130,13436,2,kookoo,11/04/2014,"Area for 6 motorhomes, with tap and emptying area. It is attached to the highway so there is a lot of noise"
10130,7153,2,lobito33,30/07/2013,Under the highway and along the railway line. Not want to test but can be a bit noisy at night.
10144,3286730,5,Babieka,11/09/2023,"Area in a strategic place, 50m away. from the spectacular beach, with that and the super friendly attention of Gustavo and Rocio (owners) there are plenty of comments. 100% recommended, don't even hesitate, go for it if you find a free place. There must be a reason?"
10144,3285074,5,LACAMPERAUI,11/09/2023,Motorhome area with all the services and with incredible views of the Cíes Islands. The beach is very beautiful and has several restaurants and beach bars to have some good cocktails and snacks. Gustavo (the owner) is a very nice guy who did not hesitate in recommending places to go to eat or to know how to get around the area. Next summer we will repeat yes or yes.
10144,3273785,5,Fran_46,08/09/2023,"I would give it 10 stars, we arrived from Seville late at night and even so they treated us very kindly, explained everything very well and recommended the plot that best suited our motorhome, clean toilets, a super quiet place, and spectacular views, if we have the opportunity we will be back!! Thank you so much."
10144,3199281,3,mark213,22/08/2023,Good. But the area above is uneven. And the garbage has to be crossed the road.
10144,3177790,3,windalo,19/08/2023,"If you manage to get sites on the lower plots I guess that will be great, because there is direct access to a wonderful beach. If you stay in the upper plot, the plots are uneven (I suppose they will improve), but I put 3 stars because the pack of dogs at night was horrible, and roosters."
10144,3167555,4,garcheto,17/08/2023,"We were very comfortable in the upper area, the services and plots with electricity are in the lower area about 50m away, they no longer have a laundry service, 2 bathrooms and showers, a sink and barbecues."
10144,3165254,4,vividores,17/08/2023,"Everything is very perfect until you get to the services. I'll explain there are two parking lots, one near the beach, as it says, with all the services except hot water, and another at the top that only has water filling and emptying For the rest, grays go to the baker 2 times a day and the fishmonger 1 with super fresh and local products."
10144,3159210,5,BlackSunlight,16/08/2023,Excellent area to spend a few days near the beach. With all services. 2 bathrooms and 2 showers. The baker comes by twice a day.
10144,3115007,4,flenillon,10/08/2023,"Private campsite perfectly located on the edge of the beach. Don't expect luxury but everything is functional, the pitches are tight but that's fine. It is a pleasant area where we stayed 3 nights to enjoy this fine sand."
10144,3095177,4,aketza,07/08/2023,"Good area to sleep, quiet, two steps from the beach and close to a beach bar that serves Mexican food, good mojitos, and cars nearby. Bakery and fishmonger service in the area. Very friendly treatment"
10144,3061709,5,felixrasero,02/08/2023,Very cool area with spectacular views of a very beautiful beach in front of the Islands only one but the showers and bathrooms are together and sometimes it is a bit complicated but otherwise highly recommended
10144,3043762,4,ClaudiaCamper,30/07/2023,"The war zone is parked! Directly al mare, super packed? When the bath is complete, boil it for 1€ for 5 minutes"
10144,3032981,5,jarmoso,28/07/2023,"After many years touring the peninsula from south to north, this little corner was the great discovery. A luxury to have these types of areas. The owners are passionate about this world, demonstrating their passion in every corner, in every detail for the comfort of the client. Unique place, with a spectacular beach. Let's take care of these spaces. Long live Gustavo and Rocío!"
10144,3018234,1,Mari59,25/07/2023,"A very comfortable area. The charming owners. Light and water in the square and deposit to empty gray water. The entrance is a bit confusing, but no problem. €15/day and 5 light. A 20"" walk to Portonovo. Praia da Pragueira with exit from the Area. Very quiet. The baker passes 2 times a day and the fishmonger 1. RECOMMENDED"
10144,3012437,5,JoaoBastos,24/07/2023,Privileged area and very welcoming staff. Spectacular beach right in front
10144,2998241,3,Abrah,21/07/2023,"Ideal location, hoses to fill without moving the motorhome and you can even empty it with a deposit that they lend you, a luxury. Defects: the bathrooms/showers together and two alone, the common areas neglected, with tall grass, broken lighting, accumulation of scrap in some area and that there are three people attending the area; they could do better with the billing they have daily."
10144,2997023,4,kiki_joseph,21/07/2023,"The perfect area, perfect beach access, just down some stairs. The place is great, and the owner is super friendly, he allowed us to stay the next day until 4:00 p.m. The only problem is the showers and bathrooms, which are together and people accumulate, so you have to wait a long time: if you don't have a toilet in the car, it's a bit of a pain, because they are occupied by the showers."
10144,2989610,5,marijoSanfelix,19/07/2023,We went to spend one night with our van and we stayed for three days. Next to a beautiful beach. The owners very friendly. Thank you!!
10144,2987140,5,Maestrina,19/07/2023,"I loved the site! Plots with sea views, direct access to a quiet and very beautiful beach. The baker passes twice a day and a fishmonger also comes. The bathrooms are immaculate and with all kinds of cleaning products at the door. It has a grill, sinks and various hoses and places to empty the chemical toilet. Very close beach bars The owner has been very kind."
10144,2960302,5,ritxi666,13/07/2023,"Three fantastic nights, highly recommended place, thanks for the attention"
10144,2946754,4,patval974,10/07/2023,Great place. there are all services and parking in good space is for 24 hours but possible more at discretion. The baker comes around 10am. The beach is just behind with beautiful coves and sand. At 200 m chiringuito and restaurant.
10144,2946215,5,guantxu,10/07/2023,"If you like nature, having the beach at your doorstep and if the crowing of the roosters reminds you of the town, this is your area."
10144,2931903,4,InaMarDav,07/07/2023,"The site is phenomenal, level plots, on the beach. Very calm. With filling and emptying of water, all services. Showers with 1 euro coins."

10144,2884204,5,Zappy56,23/06/2023,We spent an afternoon and night there on June 21st. Superb space to park your motorhome. We had a pitch facing the beach under the trees. Peaceful and super clean place. Impeccable sanitary and shower. Very kind owners
10144,2884109,5,RAlex1310,23/06/2023,"great pitch. many shady places. Somewhat hidden driveway, but you can tell by the large MAN WOMO. friendly owner, plumbing perfectly fine. direct beach access. dogs allowed"
10144,2870648,4,FRANDOM02,19/06/2023,A place you shouldn't miss if you like a little wild sites. Installations a little spartan but very clean. The owners are very friendly and attentive I highly recommend
10144,2819713,3,bpjeuz,04/06/2023,"To enter the area, do not enter the paved road. Take the dirt road 50 meters ahead. With an 8.50 meter motorhome with 1 trailer of 4.50 meters, it's a hassle. To get out, very steep hill. I had to do it twice: the motorhome alone, then the trailer hitched to the quad. for smaller motorhomes and without a trailer, very pleasant place..."
10144,2806391,5,lutz448,31/05/2023,"We drive a vehicle 8.50 meters long and 3.50 meters high, weigh about 6 tons and drove the gravel road to the parking space without any problems. The entrance to the main street was open and a sign read: Reception points the way. You will be rewarded with a great sea view. Direct access to the beach. The place is functional and well-kept. The owner is friendly."
10144,2777665,5,MarinaAb,23/05/2023,Superb area where you can park for 10€ (1€ for a 5min hot shower). Everything is clean and well maintained. The view of the beach is sublime. We even had the right to a sunset. I highly recommend.
10144,2777506,1,ReinerReisdorf,23/05/2023,"If you didn't get to the parking space through the narrow streets, it's probably only for vans. But even from a distance it didn't look inviting."
10144,2777364,5,comun187,22/05/2023,"Super recommended area on the beach, shadows, super friendly owners, very quiet place"
10144,2773250,5,MeryDi,21/05/2023,Very quiet and well-kept area with all the services. Unbeatable location and they are shade. The friendly and helpful owners. Recommended 100%. We go to her several times a year and will continue to do so.

10144,2747069,5,Skyman99,13/05/2023,"Ignore comments about only 24hr stay. This wonderful place is open full time. You can stay as long as you wish. It is wrong that there are reviews saying different. You have a very good beach almost to yourself, we saw dolphins every day."
10144,2744019,5,Twixt,12/05/2023,"On site on 10/05 we really appreciated this space, clean, well organized. Very warm welcome from the owner. This area is located at the edge of the beach which ensures a magnificent landscape and a night lulled to the sound of the waves! What more !!! Maybe to be able to come back to it, which we will do as soon as possible."
10144,2741497,5,conserlians,11/05/2023,"One of the best areas I've been to. On the beach with all services. There is a neighbor daughter of your PM who tries to make your life miserable. The xunta de Galicia, Aguas de Galicia and Costas also try it. I liked the owner, he is an excellent person and very kind. totally recommended"
10144,2688869,5,Buslopez,22/04/2023,"Very quiet, on the beach itself and magnificent views, recommended one hundred x one hundred."
10144,2674427,5,CrisR.,16/04/2023,"It is a fantastic area, mostly level plots, with sinks, barbecue and two complete toilets with showers for a fee of €1/5 min, super clean. The baker passes around 10 in the morning and the owners are charming. You can only stay 24 hours. (and it is not the decision of the owners but of the Xunta, a shame that from the Xunta they try to end the private areas)"
10144,2661525,5,gustavo-fsco.,11/04/2023,"Passage or transit motorhome area. Place on the beach, magnificent views. It has toilets and showers. The baker passes by daily and also the fishwife. barbecues"
10144,2661310,5,churrifurgo,11/04/2023,"We were camped for two days at Easter and it was very good, spacious spaces, direct access to the beach, spacious bathrooms, hot shower for €1/5'"
10144,2656238,4,koalaiadan,10/04/2023,"We spent 4 days in this holy week. Acceptable pitches, spectacular views, and a peaceful environment with the sound of the sea in the background day and night. The bathrooms and showers are appreciated (although it would not be bad if it had a couple more showers :) as well as the sinks. If I had the option of having electricity, we would give it 5 stars without hesitation."
10144,2654929,4,annruu,09/04/2023,"We spent one night this Easter and it was very good, the terrain is good and the views are very cool. Direct access to the beach."
10144,2630836,4,Laurencelefeuvre,30/03/2023,very beautiful pitches with a very beautiful view access is a bit difficult with a trailer the showers are large and clean (1 euros) no trash can and no electricity no washing machine owner speaks a little French very nice weathervanes
10144,2629724,4,Charlie0604,29/03/2023,"Beautiful place, a hop to the beach & sea. You fall asleep to the sound of waves. Great showers! Place a bit uneven, you need wedges. Lawn is being made new, that's good too. Nice owner. Electricity would still be great :)"
10144,2611897,5,isagu,16/03/2023,"Very good attention, recommended on the beach"
10144,2585736,3,BlancaBM,21/02/2023,Great views and friendly staff. It has emptying of gray and black and filled with water. Plots more or less flat. There are also toilets and showers (1€).
10144,2581567,5,fabiennedufaud,18/02/2023,great area very friendly very nice quiet beautiful view of the sea very nice owners to recommend
10144,2552528,4,womoulmi,15/01/2023,"We were almost alone, so we had a seat in the first row with a direct view of the sea and lots of waves! €10 for one night with electricity is a fair price. Washing machine 3€, dryer 4€. The direct driveway is still very improvised…."
10144,2434754,5,JanL.,10/10/2022,"Dream location, some pitches with a direct view of the beach. Do not park too close to the trees as the pigeons fill everything up. 2x shower, toilet and sink - very clean. Beginning of October 10€ per night 5€ electricity. You have to have enough 1€ coins for shower (1), washing machine (3) and dryer (4). Bars and restaurants all closed on September 30th, but in the next bay (10min, nudist beach) a bar open."
10144,2405271,5,Anamallegue,26/09/2022,All perfect. They are very friendly and have all the services. The site is beautiful.
10144,2398858,4,klauscamper,24/09/2022,"on the beach, the entrance a bit winding, the correct, friendly, gloomy services."
10144,2395553,5,Tattersp,23/09/2022,"Third time here. Still fantastic. Very busy at weekends but during the week much quieter. Right on the beach which allows dogs. Nearby supermarket and a lovely beach bar. They have built a new entrance which is easier to access the site from the road, just look out for the black water signpost. Will definitely be back."
10144,2348314,5,moi2220,07/09/2022,"The best place I've been on vacation. The area in terms of facilities, not reservation and entrance is 3.5 or 4 stars. But the site is unbeatable, the bestial beach (one of the quietest in the area), the proximity to it, the walking routes along a path born from the area, beach bars and kindness of owners."
10144,2314785,4,hgrtatin,28/08/2022,"with little space but the beach and the services are 10, the excellent location, the idea of family showers is very good, bakery and fishmonger service Those responsible are very kind"
10144,2304234,4,anamei,26/08/2022,We could not stay because there was not space. The location is very good but campers are very packed on August…
10144,2297786,5,blor,25/08/2022,"One of the best of the areas we have been. Friendliness, cleanliness, order, beach at the door, beach bars in the surroundings, baker, fishmonger. Thank you Gustavo, I think it's the name of the man who greets us, because of the lumbago cream he gave us."
10144,2297622,5,anidoc,25/08/2022,"Gustavo not only found us a place but also saved the space for us while we went to dinner in Sanxenxo, the deal is 10. Very clean bathrooms with showers (only 2). There are quite a few places but it seems that it is usually very full."
10144,2295138,4,Patxo22,24/08/2022,"The location has a 5. Other aspects are disappointing: the boy does not guarantee you a place but tells you to go around 12 and wait ""because someone always leaves"" (they leave until 3:00 p.m.). There are 2 bathrooms in which the shower and the toilet are next to each other, so if there are 2 people taking a shower, the toilets cannot be used. Depending on which plot you get, the pigeons leave the awning and the roof full of shit."
10144,2293693,4,Mowflow,24/08/2022,"beautiful campsite, there are 2 rooms each with a toilet and shower, all very well maintained. Pitches are directly on the sea, out of the gate below and you are on the beach. Small supermarket 20 mins walk away. Various restaurants less than 5 minutes away. The only negative is that there are pigeons in the trees, which soil the car, camping chairs, etc. with their droppings."
10144,2290489,4,Carmengh,23/08/2022,"The man who runs it very friendly, the great location near the beach. The only bad thing is where the poti is emptied, it does not seem like a suitable place, it is very close to the plots"
10144,2289155,4,joanes,23/08/2022,It's fine but not to make rockets either. There is not much space but a magnificent beach at the foot of AC. The price is fair. The owner does not know when and who is going to leave to give you a plot. Upon arrival he told us that people would come out and we spent more than two hours waiting for a place to be made and that we called in advance. I give it 4 stars because the location next to the beach is amazing
10144,2264352,5,Multivag,18/08/2022,Very good place with access to the beach. We arrived a little late and the man found us a space without any problem. Very friendly. Huge shower with bath. The bad thing is that it is one euro 5 minutes of hot water but the system works very well.
10144,2254477,5,jule20,17/08/2022,"Very nice parking space for mobile homes. Nice owner who speaks very good English and explains and shows everything. Showers and toilets are always very clean and are cleaned several times, but sometimes the waiting time is a bit longer. Parking space directly on the beautiful white sandy beach. Unfortunately, there are also a lot of pigeons in the trees that can an**** you. We paid €15 per night without electricity."
10144,2240201,5,gonzalopulido,15/08/2022,"great area next to the beach, spectacular views, the owners are very friendly and are aware of everything, super clean shower toilet and family format, they should learn in other places, you can shower with your family and take advantage of the water, entrance access a little complicated, it is a dirt road that leaves the general, very quiet area, recommended."
10144,2236009,5,lacampana,14/08/2022,"We came for one night and four of us stayed, an area of 10 with everything mentioned above, I would only make one improvement, I would need to have two more bathrooms separate from the showers since it depends on what time it is, it is a bit complicated to go to the toilet since there is a long queue for the showers."
10144,2193746,3,mogonzale,07/08/2022,You can only use the shower if you spend the night there
10144,2143464,5,chusos399,29/07/2022,"Best AC area where we have been. Initially we came for one night but seeing the surroundings and access to the private beach we changed the route and stayed 3 nights. Better services than in many campsites. Constant bathroom cleaning. Baker and fishmonger daily. Beach bars very close. Bathrooms, washing machines, emptying, filling... we hope to be able to return on future trips."
10144,2141988,2,ReneMartinez,29/07/2022,"There are so many fixed and crowded that impossible for itinerants who want 1 or 2 nights. Call first, very bad entrance. It has the sea next to it, a pity not being able to stay even one night."
10144,2138596,5,lolostralien,28/07/2022,"We wanted to spend only 3 nights there, we stayed there for 9. The place is quiet, directly by the sea. The welcome is very pleasant. 5 stars for cleaning the toilets, ultra clean! We will return !"
10144,2100167,5,elrairelu,20/07/2022,"To say of this area... well, it is perfect, a paradise, incredible views, all services, electricity, emptying, filling, showers, washing machine, barbecues, shadows, garden, Pragueira beach... spectacular... the owners as the family, spectacular, very good atmosphere for families, there are bars, restaurants, furancho, in the surroundings. Goes the baker and fishmonger. At 800m supermarket and takeaway."
10144,2086547,1,FamilieGeiger,17/07/2022,Absolute disaster. The place was so full. The operator squeezes everyone tightly together and makes space where none would be. Terrible !
10144,2079451,5,IsabelPortas,16/07/2022,"It is a fabulous site with a spectacular setting. A paradise. The area is very good, it has all the services and at night you rest fabulously with the sound of the sea. The baker comes twice a day. The owners are very nice. I recommend it 100%"
10144,2078593,5,AyAOurense,16/07/2022,"Almost unbeatable area at the foot of the beach with plenty of shade; beach bars, restaurants... we recommend you visit one of the ""furanchos"" that are in the area, a 10-minute walk away. Clean facilities, impeccable toilets. Charming owners. 100% recommendable"
10144,2071991,4,jorgeGr600,14/07/2022,"A place very close to the sea and with many shadows. It looks more like a campsite than a common area. It is recommended to order a cod pie from the baker, it is delicious. I say the camping thing for the stay of each user…. They seem long-term. Otherwise very friendly and wonderful beach."
10144,2071591,5,JaviRT46,14/07/2022,"Good area for price, for the attention of the people who run it and the services it provides. If you like the beach, luxury, it seems that you are on a private beach. I give it 5 stars, although it hardly deserves it, because of the fair plots and bathrooms and emptying of gray and black water that could be improved. For the rest, for this price in high season €15 + €5 electricity, little more can be asked for."
10144,2064889,5,SipsParritta,12/07/2022,Brutal !!! Very good place with all services.
10144,2062543,5,AndreAraujo,11/07/2022,"Excellent option to spend a few days. Right by the beach, with all services and energy. Value of 15€ 5€ for energy. Bathrooms always clean and baths at €1 for 5 minutes of water. Very friendly and attentive owners. Good spaces for larger motorhomes."
10144,2055725,5,AlYMo,10/07/2022,"100x100 Recommendable Expectacular, for its facilities, for the services they offer, for the attention of the owners, proximity to the beach, distribution of daily bread, fish several days a week."
10144,2055360,5,isagu,10/07/2022,"Very well located area on the beach, lots of shade, large plots, clean facilities, the baker comes by every morning with bread and pastries, very attentive owners"
10144,2051431,5,MartaBidaia,08/07/2022,"It is a great area and very well taken care of. The bathrooms are cleaned several times a day. A van comes with bread and rolls twice a day. At the foot of the beach. With shadows. BBQ, free loading and unloading and cold shower too. I heat it at €1.50 for 5 minutes. Beach bars nearby. €15 without electricity in TA. I think with electricity it's 5€ more. You can pay by card."
10144,2022240,5,Dorothea2022,29/06/2022,"Wonderful place, we felt super comfortable! Great sea view"
10144,1995233,5,britneygears,20/06/2022,"Great little spot! Sea views, meters from the beach, facilities clean and practical, and we saw dolphins! Bought Albariño from the hosts which we’ve not tried yet. Bread van at 10am for a warm loaf €1. Nice meal from friendly restaurant a few mins walk along the pretty beach. Nobody really speaks English but we got by just fine :) Photos don’t do it justice."
10144,1992163,5,Iteuri,19/06/2022,Outstanding place. Very close to the water
10144,1991001,5,Tlm01,19/06/2022,Perfect. A few meters from the beach. The manager is very friendly. all services for a reasonable price. The delivery of bread in the morning is a real plus. thank you

10144,1984521,5,conserlians,17/06/2022,"a perfect area. beach a few meters away, barbecue, bathrooms, washing machines. I go summer and winter. Gustavo, (owner) a great person. Now with the extension it has been incredible."
10144,1973760,5,wauzibande,13/06/2022,"One of the most beautiful places we have seen in Spain. The approach is a bit steep and therefore exciting, beware of oncoming traffic, the place rewards you with a great view and a beautiful beach. Simply to enjoy. It is quiet, there are toilets, washing-up facilities and a washing machine. The plots are large enough that you can even put a chair and table outside. If we could give more stars we would. ?"
10144,1961162,5,sergio1709,09/06/2022,"A camping area that many campsites would like to have, very quiet, the beach about 30 meters away with direct access to it and a very cheap price. I give it 10 stars in rating"
10144,1959920,5,wouterenchloe,08/06/2022,"We really enjoyed our nights there. Right on the sea, beautiful! Hot shower for 1 euro (5 min). Furthermore, all facilities available. Getting there was all right for us! Friendly owners."
10144,1958120,3,janvan75,08/06/2022,"small beautifully situated, Google sends over a very bad road 2 showers for roughly 40 campers, 1 euros for a 5 minute shower. had bad weather I quickly left. a parking space is just as comfortable"
10144,1937378,4,Mickey3701,01/06/2022,"Another example of a private area that offers almost the same services as a campsite with a prime location, but at a much more affordable price. Too bad, the equipment and the decor lack a bit of warmth."
10144,1929232,5,laurafcarballo,29/05/2022,"A great area, with all the services (toilets, hot showers for €1, sinks...) and very friendly staff. It is on the beach and with a path for hiking along the coast. We will come back for sure. If you are lucky that there are not many people, there are wooded areas for the hottest days."
10144,1910697,5,Shaun1,23/05/2022,Very nice place on the beach under trees. Sanitary facilities modern and clean. The baker comes by at 10:30 a.m. :-)
10144,1877020,4,Rita__Duarte,08/05/2022,"amazing place with sea water front, grass all around, private access to the beach. services a bit old, but worthy."

10144,1841712,5,walsch,20/04/2022,"unfortunately there are no 7 stars to be awarded here... just fantastic. friendly owners, everything very clean, no noise...you only hear the waves that lull you to sleep"
10144,1824668,5,CHOLIMA,15/04/2022,"Fantastic area, on the first level you are above the sea, here we are and we will stay until Sunday. highly recommended"

10144,1809874,5,PerlaBedford,07/04/2022,"Welcome to Paradise! With their incredible hospitality, Rocio and Gustavo have managed to create a place of longing right on the Atlantic coast. Breathtaking views of the Atlantic including dolphins, direct access to Playa Pragueira, great value for money, electricity, fresh water, gray and black water, gas service, grill station, bakery, fish car, security"
10144,1808843,4,RicardoGarcia,06/04/2022,"Incredible site, beautiful views, the place a bit abandoned, but to spend a night, unloading and loading water is not bad."
10144,1802610,4,sylinou,01/04/2022,An extraordinary view of the ocean. The woman who welcomes us is of a kindness that we would like to find everywhere. The entrance is cramped and very sloping. We have an 8m and a trailer that did it except that we put the car back on the trailer only after being reassembled.
10144,1784898,5,medoingthings,16/03/2022,"We spent two nights here. Nice operator, rather minimal knowledge of English, but no problem. Beautiful view and sunset, short access to the beach, great with kids. Two clean toilets (but no soap) with a large shower, cleaned daily. We were lucky and watched dolphins from the campsite. Clear recommendation!"
10144,1779136,5,FlynLoh,10/03/2022,Amazing campsite at the beach. Every morning the local baker drives in so you can buy bread for 1 euro. Great sunsets!
10144,1772566,5,arkaitzito,03/03/2022,"Very good to go with children, next to the beach, with the right services to spend a couple of days. the people who run it are very friendly. the entrance gives rise to doubts (it looks narrow and you have to enter in the opposite direction) but any motorhome passes without problems."
10144,1767354,4,xunpugnodieuro,27/02/2022,"Spent 1 night here, position overlooking the sea but the places with a view are very few. 10 € without electricity, including loading and unloading. Huge showers 1 € / 5min. There was some mud, it could be better maintained. Direct access to the beach. Stupendous."
10144,1749466,5,Crohuir,06/02/2022,"beautiful site, €10 without electricity, €15 with electric. Lovely owner, amazing location right on the beach. Perfect no frills site"
10144,1735703,5,IsabelBonninCosta,17/01/2022,A perfect place. All kinds of services. The baker has brought fresh bread at 9.30am! Spectacular beach views! I recommend it 100%
10144,1700956,5,RotecGo,01/12/2021,"Great place, direct access to the sea and also great campers in the off-season. We were even able to collect and enjoy mussels"
10144,1692135,5,Bulma80,18/11/2021,On the beach. We sleep listening to the sea. That is wonderful. Very good area with all services. Hot water showers for € 1 / 5min. € 10 without electricity in low season. Baker passes around 10am. Very friendly owners.
10144,1683593,5,openend2020,09/11/2021,"Everything is so great, as already described several times. Nature lovers are right here, hiking trails directly from the square. Terraced with sun and shade places. Equipment simple, but very clean. However, it only has 2 toilets and showers, each toilet and shower in the same room. That could be tight with full occupancy. We would come back."
10144,1666774,5,distlerei,28/10/2021,The following goodies to supplement our comment: a small baker's cart comes by every day at around 10 a.m. and a fish truck at least on Tuesday and Thursday around 12 p.m. :)) It couldn't be better!
10144,1665476,5,distlerei,28/10/2021,"If you don't want to stand free, but still close to the sea, you've come to the right place. Space on 3 levels, great beach, which belongs to you almost alone in October, direct access (gate is closed at night). For those who are sensitive to noise: dog barking for hours at times at night, which can be quite annoying, and loud surf. Unfortunately we didn't see any dolphins, would come again anyway!"
10144,1642843,5,larsahlberg,13/10/2021,"Perfect pitch, close to a wonderful beach. And about 8 minutes walking distance to good restaurant. Would easily go here again."
10144,1604477,5,Titosdeparla,24/09/2021,"A good place to spend a few days quiet, on these dates there is no problem to go down with the dogs to the beach. The owner is very friendly. Very recommendable site."
10144,1559036,5,MarisaFF,08/09/2021,"All the services of a campsite with enough places. If you go with a small van like us, you have plenty of room on the pitches. I recommend if you can get on the pitches below, with views and shade almost all day. Direct access to the beach. I recommend the Prado Bello beach bar, with a good menu, views and live music. 15 euros, 20 with light and showers at 1 euro, dogs are allowed."
10144,1555417,5,diego278,07/09/2021,"At the foot of the beach, it has large squares with electricity although it is usually quite full. It has toilets and hot showers. Dishwasher, washing machine and dryer sinks. Also barbecue area. The area is very quiet and has direct access to the beach with magnificent views!"
10144,1538334,4,blor,01/09/2021,Good place to spend a few days at the beach. Restaurant nearby. Baker in the morning. Luckily you can take a plot with shade.

10144,1507257,4,05kar,24/08/2021,"Quiet but overcrowded area. Of course, they are very attentive and they look for a hole until something free is left. The emptying and filling area in the middle of the two streets it has. The beach of 10. White sand. Rocks at low tide to look for octopus or spider crabs. A beach bar and a hotel nearby. There is no dumpster. It is out on the road. Narrow access for badly parked cars"
10144,1506101,5,Javilaura,24/08/2021,"Highly recommended area, quiet, with a spectacular beach and very attentive and friendly owners. Barbecue, showers, washing machine, sinks, and everything very clean, we will return for sure. TOP area"
10144,1477660,5,origuiyu,18/08/2021,Thanks for letting us stay one night.
10144,1463606,5,Lunila,15/08/2021,"Area at the foot of the beach (full of seaweed the days we were there), the very friendly owner temporarily placed us until there was a gap the next day. The baker and fishmonger pass by, he rests very well, we sleep until 10 o'clock because not a fly was heard. Access a bit complicated because it is through a very narrow forbidden direction and if a car goes up you have to make maneuvers to be able to pass."
10144,1447988,5,Correcaminosmickmick,13/08/2021,"Spectacular area and practically on the same beach. It allows dogs, has a toilet and hot water showers € 1 five minutes, and also outdoor showers.

The camp is dedicated to kids so if you want some place quiet, this will not be it, sadly even until late night. The beach is not bad but smells terribly. Also for the whole camp, you have only two shared toilets which are a shower as well. That means very long wait nearly all the time. Overall feel of the place was bad for us. Price was 15€."

I do not put 5 stars because some places are uneven and you have to put the chocks on supplements to level. The other reason for the four stars is garbage, which must be left in a container outside the area, in the parking lot of the beach and is at least 300m away. Otherwise very advisable."

10144,184264,3,alxndrschob,24/08/2017,"Would be a really nice place, but there are no toiletts at all!! 10€ for the night with electricity and water isn't much, and the beach is also great. For the day there is a toilett at thr beach 200m away, but this one closes for the night. Owner is really friendly and the vibe is good here. With toiletts definetly five stars and a longer stay."
10144,182981,4,GranCapitan,23/08/2017,Good place to be a few quiet days practically walking to the beach and listening to the sea. The access is somewhat narrow but without problems.

Camping and stairs on several levels facing the sea, and there is water, electricity and draining black and gray water virtually at all levels. Ability to refuel without moving the camper, the pipe is quite long. There is also BBQ, washing machine, and sinks for the dishes. By cons there is no Wc, no shower, but motorhome we are autonomous. Two bakers in the morning 8:30 for croissants and another around 11am. For the price, I will confirm his tomorrow, we spend our third and last night, and here we pay when we leave."

10144,156437,5,pepaypaco,23/07/2017,"Totally recommendable, the owners majusimos near of portonovo, it admits pets, the beach to the edge is listened from the Ac, also it passes the fish besides the baker"
10144,152139,5,rociero,15/07/2017,"Perfect to relax beach very close and impressive treatment of 10 but should put at the entrance of the road the FULL sign when it is to avoid the descent that is a little complex, Thank you"
10144,144038,1,miticoarpege,18/06/2017,"This is not a rest area, but a real small campsite where the manager makes several campers stuck in an absurd way, I have counted more than 60. Many believe I spend the holidays here still, the confusion is so great. The wc discharges are among the campers and not in a special area and those who are parked nearby are affected. Overall I found it quite dirty"
10144,140450,5,Cesarvalle,04/06/2017,"Spectacular motorhome parking, with spaces delimited enough to take out chairs and awning. It is located on the beach, fabulous views.

Perfect area for beach plan and beach bar. It has electricity, water and emptying. It costs the same with electricity as without it. Washing machine 3 euro. There are no toilets. Neither closed showers, there are 2 outdoors. In general, there are quite a few squares shaded by trees."
10144,86643,1,ruaix,29/07/2016,"EYE, if you go in summer you will not be able to leave until September. They are on top of each other, to access the street is already narrow, but in addition people park on both sides. Someone would have to ban this area!"
10144,83390,4,NikoBerrocal,20/07/2016,"Highly recommended site. Next to the Pragueira beach. €10 per night, and no departure time the next day. All the services.

10144,40093,5,flo74000,28/06/2015,"On the edge of the beach, this area is surely the best in Spain. Welcome with explanation from the owner (who is always available on the site), relatively flat and delimited pitches, barbecue available, possibility of washing up, very quiet. Nothing to complain about, not even the price (8 euros without electricity, 10 € with). Lots of people, get there early."
10144,21193,5,WIND,06/08/2014,"Great motorhome area, exceptional beach."
10160,3266942,5,Ricondo,07/09/2023,"We slept well at night. You can hear the waves of the sea and it is very quiet. Emptying gray and black water is free, but filling water requires a fee. Ask at the beach bar for tokens."
10160,3245479,3,overlandingcouple,01/09/2023,"Good place in itself, with water station etc. and very close to the beach. RV to RV. We stayed one night. There were strange people walking around in the evenings and during the day, and to be honest they didn't feel safe at all. There are also many dogs (males) that run around freely and are not wanted."
10160,3245057,4,j0nasw,01/09/2023,"The parking lot is ok, camper to camper. But the location is very nice, you can reach the sea in just a few steps and the restaurant right by the parking lot is also very good."
10160,3205643,4,RomeroLoewinho,23/08/2023,"Very close to a great beach. Service point suburb. We felt safe. Mobile home to mobile home, you have to like it. Showers and a nice restaurant in the immediate vicinity."
10160,3202296,5,Gurutz,22/08/2023,"Great place to spend a couple of days. It has plenty of space in the back for caravans. It has services, shower and toilets. They are free, but with cold water. It is next to the beach and a bicycle path. We met a lot of people in August, we saw people set up in camping mode. At 8:30 in the morning a van arrives to sell bread, curasanas and bars. This place is highly recommended."
10160,3170714,3,BertoCaceres,17/08/2023,"We came with our 7.5m long AC with the intention of simply staying one night and in the end we stayed for two, but more than the service area it was the beach, which is simply spectacular (nothing to envy to those in Tarifa) . The area is ok, but people think it's a campground and it's not. The AC should park in the center and leave the sides for vans."
10160,3167933,4,kkaos,17/08/2023,"Good area. We were comfortable, it is very quiet even though it is full. Go at a good time to find a place, it fills up fast. The bathroom has no light and the chain does not work."
10160,3167404,4,NahikariPotxi,17/08/2023,"We spent 2 wonderful days there, it feels like a campsite, you can take your things out and stay... the girls' bathroom is closed, but it's fine, next to the beach, warm shower, salty bread. but if it has a downside, we were bitten by mosquitoes as the sun went down, so be careful. Since we haven't filled it with water or it has to be drained, I can't give my opinion"
10160,3148891,4,thebearinthevan,14/08/2023,"Directly at the sea. unfortunately the toi is without light and not in good shape. you should come early, very crowded place. but for a free safe night, great."
10160,3141687,5,Pbarreiro,14/08/2023,Very quiet place to sleep. The best thing is that in the morning a van comes to sell bread and pastries at a very good price and everything is very tasty.
10160,3141004,5,NOAI,13/08/2023,"Perfect place to stop. Town with several bars, restaurants, mini-supermarkets. In the morning, if the sea is good, the fishermen enter with the boats directly to the beach where they later sell the fish in a beach bar. Baker-pastry chef around 8:30 AM in the camper. The beach next door, with showers and toilets. Water-Electricity you have to buy a token in the bar ""o duna""."
10160,3137239,5,albablca,13/08/2023,"We spent a very good night, very quiet. We slept accompanied by many other vans and AC. Very nice views and public bathrooms next to some beach showers. At 9 in the morning a van with pastries and bread passes by!"

10160,3104491,4,carlosrgg,08/08/2023,Correct site with services. Full in August. Very installed caravans. We had to go.
10160,3100506,4,Lenustium,08/08/2023,Nice place to stand! With a toilet it was almost a luxury if the flush worked well. But it is enough and you can go to the toilet there.
10160,3097304,4,Albium,07/08/2023,"Wonderful. Lots of caravans and vans, good atmosphere. When the sun begins to go down, some type of mosquito repellent is very necessary because it is infested. Very quiet town. With a couple of bars that close at 9:00 p.m. and a small shop with basic products. Beach bar, at the end of the parking lot; Very friendly staff and cheap homemade food. Beautiful beach. Very rough sea."
10160,3060137,4,viajeroaustriaco,01/08/2023,"Great place, very safe with many other campers. Toilet & showers available."
10160,3028108,3,sueandray,27/07/2023,"Good location next to beautiful beach but very windy. Lots of vans appear to have camped there for some time around the sides - but there were still spaces in the middle. Baker arrives with fresh bread and pastries at 08.30 and hoots loudly on arrival. Lots of dog barking at night by both local and van dogs, although quiet apart from that. Great location for some but not really what we were after."
10160,3023464,5,TasiS,26/07/2023,perfect place! right on the beach and the beach is beautiful! There are public toilets and in addition very clean toilets in the beach bar. Beach showers are also available. was the most beautiful parking lot I've been to so far!
10160,3018381,4,gafiloupio,25/07/2023,Nice area close to the beach however some people take this place for a campsite ….. it will not last the good ones will pay for the bad ….. too bad. Place to keep!!
10160,3015908,4,clarita,24/07/2023,"Second year that we return to this site, this time it seemed like a camp, people take out absolutely everything as if it were a campsite. they park as they want little empathy towards others occupying two places. the town is very small, nice beach. I hope people are responsible and respectful"
10160,2996077,5,estelledge,21/07/2023,"Everything as described, perfect"
10160,2985045,5,LeMi26,18/07/2023,"Great parking space with direct access to the sea, toilets etc. The tourist shop right up the street by the toilets is highly recommended! Nice people. Great area. Great food! Didn't pay €25 for a 3-course menu for 2 including drinks! Was one of our favorites traveling from Germany down the north coast of Spain and then to the west coast of Portugal. The place is highly recommended!!!"
10160,2981793,4,koalaiadan,18/07/2023,"We stopped for one night. A very windy area. Many motorhomes were breaking the rules (badly parked occupying several places, awnings deployed and tables and chairs outside, etc.) please let's take care of these sites so that they are not eliminated. With showers and bathrooms at the exit of the beach. Free emptying of gray and black, to refill water you need some tokens that are given in shops"
10160,2964830,3,guayoneta,14/07/2023,"The beautiful beach. It was very crowded and all the motorhomes that parked on the left side of the car park, the one closest to the dunes, broke the rules, parking in a row instead of in a row, so they occupied two spaces per motorhome, very disrespectful. Unloading of gray and wc. A little dirty"
10160,2946024,5,zerodfault,10/07/2023,"Amazing spot. Very quiet nice and nice spot. Beach views and dirt parking spots. Plenty of space to open the awning and put some chairs. There’s a cafe 1 min away on the beach. Low prices, nice space, great Wifi. Will come again!"

10160,2938785,4,kike1815,08/07/2023,"very wide ac area. Suitable for all types of AC and/or vans. The services are paid and you have to buy the chips in a local business. We didn't go up anymore because we were loaded and we don't need them. The beach is very close and accessible, beautiful sunset and at night we were calm. some loud music at noon and in the evening"
10160,2926324,4,Marycoei,05/07/2023,"Beautiful location and close to the beach, but come already stocked and unloaded. The service area leaves a lot to be desired, to fill it with clean water, even after buying the jetton it stopped working before completing the 100 liters. Impossible to wash the toilet cassette due to lack of adequate water, good only for emptying gray water. Service area a bit dirty and unkempt."
10160,2925570,5,Quicolas,05/07/2023,"Fantastic location next to the beach, a very lively place with people from all over Europe. pretty cool"

10160,2902991,5,nathalia22,28/06/2023,"Excellent area! We feel very safe here. The beach is beautiful, just across the parking lot. The cars are away from the motorhomes, so they don't interfere with anything. We had silent nights and the terrain is linear. To fill the water tank, it is necessary to buy jettons in the surrounding stores. We saw that the beach item shop, right behind the houses, also sells them. I recommend the place."
10160,2901140,4,pantoufledtc,28/06/2023,Large car park with a lot of places but often full. Friendly spirit and nice people. Showers toilets and nice beach restaurant. Depending on where you parked you see the sea from the parking lot

Thanks to the municipality."

10160,2665885,4,joelmiguel,12/04/2023,"excellent place with a very quiet night to the sound of the sea. Location looks like it stopped in the 80's, but very good for sleeping and beach. I recommend"
10160,2665646,3,vinckje,12/04/2023,"Arrived on April 11. You are actually on a parking lot, almost in the backyard of the residents. Their laundry hangs there, their car is parked there. This is not worthy of a motorhome for me. Complete disorder where everyone does their own thing. Tokens available for a fee in local shops. We did have a quiet night."
10160,2664789,4,Martybhoy,12/04/2023,12/4/23 yes it’s busy and that includes some lifers but live and let live. It’s free and right beside the beach. Would imagine it could get manic at high season. Stayed one night 20 MH’s at this time.
10160,2664623,4,munoki,12/04/2023,"The area meets decent conditions, quiet, on the beach. Free, you only pay for water €2.5/100l, something to thank the City Council for. Even so, there are people who, after spending a whole weekend or more, take the water from the showers, even letting go of the head, ignoring the @ s vecin@s and the one in charge of the bathrooms. We are not able to pay €2.5 in gratitude to the City Council for this place? Bad we go, not like that."
10160,2663248,5,MarcoCristovao,12/04/2023,WING very good! Very friendly people! Very calm ! perfect wing to rest

10160,2654290,5,cristena,09/04/2023,Brilliant! We slept one night and it was very quiet! It has beach showers and toilets. There is a little boy next door that costs €0.90 for coffee!
10160,2647914,5,txampe,07/04/2023,"Quiet area at least during Easter, it seems that there were some motorhomes and caravans settled. There are showers and beach toilets. The filling water was paid for and we did not use it. Perfect for a couple of days"
10160,2644744,1,mexi2000,06/04/2023,"Wow. In April 2023 an El Dorado of German cosiness. Please be careful not to trip over umbrellas, deck chairs, dream catchers, solar panels, satellite dishes, anteroom rugs, garden gnomes and similar equipment. Ashamed of others and just leave quickly..."

Didn't like it did stop the night as we had driven along way and it was quite at night but just not for me"
10160,2622750,5,nhamza,24/03/2023,"Excellent area with well organized space. We tested the restaurants in the village but we highly recommend the Marisqueira Xávega Da Costa. Excellent welcome, discreet and efficient service, peaceful restaurant of high culinary quality. Be careful, it offers terrible local meats and fish too! Treat yourself."
10160,2620039,4,denmo,22/03/2023,"Place with sea view possible. Fill and empty everything. A good restaurant where the Portuguese also come to eat. Walk towards the toilets, turn right, after the roundabout left at the back of the street. Delicious menu of the day for euro 11.50. incl coffee with liqueur. A Perola de Oceano!."
10160,2614096,4,samrobinson499,18/03/2023,"Nice little seaside town with a very big motorbike area, toilets were open and was a very peaceful night next to the waves"
10160,2610296,2,Sham90,15/03/2023,"Parking is pretty well done, but big negative point, there is no network. In addition, it is not very quiet, vehicles pass and dogs bark late at night and early in the morning. There was even a scooter that passed, honking its horn all along the motorhome parking lot."
10160,2587725,4,RossiSimona,23/02/2023,Free camper area with parking right on the beach. Unfortunately a few weeks ago the load was not working. I hope it works now. Quiet night. Thank you

10160,2582907,1,MoustacheTour,19/02/2023,"We were looking forward to this place, but we were very disappointed. It is very crowded, some cars have already made themselves at home, it stinks of excrement and there is dog excrement everywhere. Cars are constantly driving by, engines are running or a dog is barking. And you don't have a view either, you have to walk to the beach and it stinks there too."
10160,2575468,1,varrager,12/02/2023,"First you pay, then the water doesn't work and you don't get your money back"

10160,2553664,4,OzeanienArt-on-Tour,17/01/2023,"We have been there 3 times this winter, but only briefly. Is very empty there this winter. I found it quite disturbing that recently many cars etc. are speeding through from the new beach restaurant. Children and animals wouldn't stand a chance, so be careful! Otherwise it is a small, cute village with very nice residents. On Sundays you can get delicious chicken in the little shop."
10160,2550252,2,fan4womo,12/01/2023,"Well, I found the place nice during the day, but at night, or in storms and rain, it would be too scary for me there. A German Morelo Palace is there regularly and you could talk a bit. All around there are also a lot of ancient mobile home sweethearts that probably don't go too far anymore. The driveway to the square is quite a steep, long ramp!"
10160,2537179,5,Motorhomemom,01/01/2023,"The best place.
Quiet and peaceful.All services work.
Large beach,bike paths along the woods.And walking decks between town and the ocean."

10160,2523818,5,Timovandewiel,18/12/2022,Very good spot next to the see. Near by a cheap bar. Skatepark and playing area for kids. I would recommend this place a lot! At night it’s quit!
10160,2503680,5,mollotuttoevadoavivereincamper,23/11/2022,"Large parking lot with loading and unloading for campers 100m from the ocean. Peaceful, clean and quiet at night. Highly recommended. Also at the chiringuito next door (Bar de Praia) very kind staff, ocean view and menu at 12 euros (drinks and dessert included) really top."
10160,2499772,5,Larifari22,19/11/2022,"We stood here 3 nights. Although it was relatively busy, it was very quiet and pleasant. There is water for €2.50. At the front of the beach there are toilets and a beach shower. There is also a beach bar that offers great things at reasonable prices. The view of the sea from there is great. In the morning at 9am there is a baker who sells delicious baked goods. Only to be recommended."
10160,2497733,5,oiliv,17/11/2022,"Wonderful place. However, very poor reception on the cell phone."
10160,2496387,5,Cneel,15/11/2022,"Top spot. Everything motorhome needs. Excellent sani station. Coins for water for sale in local shop. Baker comes by in the morning. Tasty affordable restaurants. It doesn't get any better. At the coordinates we came to the wrong entrance, which makes it seem that you can't get on it. Just drive around the block."
10160,2488504,5,frintropergrill,09/11/2022,"Top parking space, we don't need and want more. Everything already said. I don't have a dog and I haven't seen any dog poo"
10160,2487902,5,Antichrist,08/11/2022,Parking space for one or more nights completely OK free of charge. Small shops about 3 minutes away on foot. Great bar with super delicious tosta mista right on the beach.
10160,2480056,5,aweylands,03/11/2022,"Beautiful and free place, right on the sea and very quiet. Offers supply and disposal, as well as free toilets and outdoor showers. We had a very comfortable night. It would be absolutely amazing if there were places like this every 50 kilometers :-)"
10160,2479976,5,FredFlintsone,03/11/2022,"Few campers in early November. We spent a quiet night here. The new beach cafe on the beach has a fantastic view, unfortunately the kitchen was already closed. The nice young man made us some toasts that were delicious. We would come again."
10160,2455307,5,phil10101010,21/10/2022,"Super nice place right by the sea. The PP is free, only water costs, you need a chip that you have to get in the nearby kiosk. Unfortunately completely overcrowded in October by long-term parkers who take up far too much space. About 1/3 of the PP on the beach are blocked for Womo with height restrictions."
10160,2445331,3,Ruby81,15/10/2022,"It's ok to stay overnight. For the stay, however, it is not even enough for breakfast. We have a dog ourselves, but everything was full of dog waste, which is not so nice. Pity ! The beach is very close and wide."
10160,2444330,4,Lesaintbernard,15/10/2022,Multiple parking lots but unfortunately a small village full of dirt... The waste at the entrance is everywhere but otherwise close to the nice beach. Ideal for a night or two on a stopover.
10160,2443911,4,JennyClaudia,14/10/2022,The pitch itself is ok. and really very close to the beach. The city is not well maintained. it is more of a fishing village and it smells accordingly. Dog poop is really everywhere. we stayed one night. not relevant for us but you really don't have a network here. For a night and a walk TOP
10160,2438365,4,lifri,11/10/2022,Beautiful free space right by the sea behind the dunes. Slightly rancid toilets. Lots of mosquitoes in the evening.
10160,2427614,5,MalinaMalinowy,06/10/2022,A great place. Peace and quiet and a beautiful beach right next to the parking lot. There is also a bar. It is a pity that half of the car park is separated for passenger cars because it is empty and for motorhomes all spaces are taken. Without electricity. There is a service.
10160,2426155,3,Luc1112,06/10/2022,"Large parking extra for CC. Directly on the beach with somewhat dirty toilets but clean outdoor showers. Two stars deducted because the internet is very bad here and some campers spread out as if they own the place. Furthermore, a disgusting stench comes from a nearby factory every now and then. We are only staying here as an emergency night"

And here is my request: Dear dog owners, please take the legacies of your dogs with you. The one at the entrance to the beach was badly soiled with it this morning. It is not surprising that the residents are angry and ban dogs."

10160,2327431,4,maary0207,01/09/2022,A beautiful place. In the high season it is worth getting there early as the place fills up quickly. Some campers spend their whole vacation there and therefore take up a lot of space.
10160,2320625,4,bateauenmer,30/08/2022,very good small pleasant village very quiet
10160,2300665,4,mariquillaterremoto,25/08/2022,"Ample parking near the beach. You can't see the sea but it is a few meters away. There are filling and electricity services, but they cost €2.50. Emptying is free. There are outside toilets and showers. The baker passes at 9. There is a beach bar nearby and soccer fields and a children's park. We ate at a small restaurant bar called “Perola” about 200 meters away, highly recommended!"
10160,2299337,4,JanEdinger,25/08/2022,Beautiful place right on the sea with an inviting promenade made of wooden walkways and a new Xiringuito next door (we didn't test it). Beach showers and public toilets available. A bit noisy due to the vehicles and dogs making noise from early morning. We didn't fill up the water. Unfortunately very unreliable cell phone reception.
10160,2291765,3,parknight1731,23/08/2022,Nice area because near the sea. On the other hand a lot of passage because car parking at the end. Too bad also that some motorhomes take 2 places.
10160,2291438,2,r.kappauf,23/08/2022,"The pitch is mainly occupied by the Portuguese during the season, who rudely indicate that they are the ""lords"". It's teeming with dogs and their legacies, even on the beach. From time to time at night a bestial stench wafts over from the nearby cellulose factory. In preseason it was tolerable and the pecking order wasn't that clear."

10160,1823757,5,DiscoveryVan,15/04/2022,Nice place. Beach a few meters away with village. In the morning the baker goes by with the van. It was the most hustle and bustle of the day rest area we could find. People / children screaming and dogs off the leash. But this is not the fault of the rest area but of human incivility. For the rest everything is ok .. water at € 2.50 per token to be taken at bars and other shops.
10160,1822534,5,biquet5155,14/04/2022,It is rare to find a free parking area at the edge of the ocean. there are pitches for long camper vans. Direct access to the beaches. Nickel services. Very quiet at night at this time. Well lighted. Enjoyed. Intermarche in Lavos. Nice little restaurants. Thank you to this municipality.
10160,1803963,4,klr40,02/04/2022,"A nice place for a few nights. We found it very good that we had the opportunity to get our chairs and table out here, as this is often not possible with free parking spaces. In general there was a comfortable and pleasant climate. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because a bit of green space would be nice. But it's free, so it's great."
10160,1783106,4,MoriHH,14/03/2022,"We stayed here for two nights as we had an appointment. Some permanent campers, supply and disposal available, but water, both for the toilet and fresh water, only with chips that have to be bought in the cafes in the area. super awkward. Otherwise quiet location right on the sea. A baker comes in the morning. Here you stand safe and free of charge."

I had bought a coin, it was refunded to me, thank you. but I left today because I had no more water. so be careful if you want to stop over: bring water. on the other hand for the drains no problem. thank you to this small municipality for this park I will come back."
10160,1746345,5,AlesjaPetkau,02/02/2022,Stayed 2 nights here. A beautiful beach with friendly villagers. There is a small playground for children and a small skater park. Highly recommended.

10160,1725460,5,OzeanienArt-on-Tour,04/01/2022,"I wanted to stay away from the crowds of the Algarve and stayed here for a while. It is a very special place here on a great beach with so many different walks. And so we keep coming back! The water thing doesn't always work, patience is required. I'll be back, a great place if not too crowded."
10160,1711625,5,calle5621,17/12/2021,"Great pitch! We were there in December. The bread trolley comes every day (except Mondays) at 9 a.m. Delicious rolls and very, very fair prices. The sea and the beach can be reached within a few minutes on foot. I can recommend the place with a clear conscience. Unfortunately, toilets and showers were already closed - but it wasn't a problem for us."
10160,1709890,5,jff,14/12/2021,"You don't want to advertise so that this great place is not occupied by permanent campers like many others. But it's perfect here! Right on the sea, extremely quiet and everything clean and undamaged! Access also for large vehicles and even a few spaces for caravan teams."
10160,1708244,4,anissabou,11/12/2021,"Very good spot, except that the internet connection is very bad. Me who had to work is missed haha. The beach is great, it's quite peaceful at this time of year."
10160,1702184,3,Philip,03/12/2021,"The location is very good, close to the sea, quiet and with services. But one has the impression of living in a kennel… The motorhome operators are full of dogs, the inhabitants too and all this gets excited and barks continuously."
10160,1695645,5,Lauravenard,22/11/2021,"Excellent night on this free motorhome tune. Two different parking spaces, namely one for large vehicles and one for vehicles of less than 2.20m (barrier). It is calm, flat and there is an area for gray water available. Very close to the beach, ideal for surfing. You can also fill your tanks with water, but you have to go and buy tokens in the shops, something we haven't done. We recommend !"
10160,1694601,4,ToInfinityAndBeyond,21/11/2021,"Great service and parking area right by the beach. There are many parking spots (but it was almost full in mid November), just on the edge of the little village, really quiet at this time of the year. We stayed overnight and it was just really peaceful. We didn't use the services, but for the fresh water you need to buy a token at some store, so opening hours could be an issue."
10160,1690410,4,MarioFdz,16/11/2021,"We stopped to do services and we could not refill since the water works with jetrones. Even so, I found the place very pleasant with very spacious parking spaces and next to an immense beach, if I returned to the area I would not hesitate to stay for several days"
10160,1686055,5,povilas393,12/11/2021,Very good spot to stay for couple days. I can understand why some people camping here for weeks. You have everything you need here. Also very quiet during day and night.
10160,1683924,3,bluesman42,10/11/2021,Nice spot with the beach 2 minutes away and beautiful small waves for surfers. Free drain. For water we will see later. The barking of the dogs rocked me and replaced my morning alarm clock
10160,1682235,5,tedventure,08/11/2021,"Nice quiet place where you can safely stay for a few nights. Quiet village (because of the late season, in the summer it is busier here). Enough camper spots. Also for small campers. We stood with a sea view. Toilet and shower next to it. Beach is a 5 minute walk. Recommended!"

10160,1557329,4,Angelitesa,07/09/2021,"It can be improved and one of the ways would be that there are personnel who camp and have no consideration or respect for such a beautiful place, it would be a lot to ask that they be clean and respectful, just that way it would be perfect. Thank you Lavos beach."
10160,1540547,5,columpetas,02/09/2021,"Perfect for sleeping and spending the day on the beach, along the beach promenade the fishermen sell freshly caught fish. There are showers, toilets, all emptying, filling, etc. services. It's nice to go to places like that, where they do love us. There is a clearance to enter the town. but in the first line we have the area and the town 2 min walking. RECOMMENDABLE"

10160,1466905,3,Jac0569,16/08/2021,"Good proximity to the beach. Unfortunately, it's pretty dirty. So much plastic on the beach and the garbage is rarely picked up. Furthermore, the cars are racing here as if there is no tomorrow. Dangerous for children who run around between the Womos."

10160,1267645,5,msbird,21/06/2021,"For me one of the best places by the sea in Portugal. Sure, dogs everywhere, but it's the same everywhere on the Iberian Peninsula ... Thank you very much to the community! Unfortunately, there are also those ""overnight guests in the car"" who see nature as their toilet. Shame on you! Because of people like you, we campers are hardly allowed to stand anywhere anymore."
10160,1261125,4,Sneeuwwitje,17/06/2021,Beautifully close to beach! Showers and toilets available as well as waste water drainage and clean supply. Clean water costs a bit of money. Even a baker comes by to sell bread in the morning! Very nice place!!

10160,1082405,4,LecomteKristof,05/10/2020,"Quiet place close to the sea. 30 places, but almost all of them were full (even low season). It is a pity that one of the residents of the adjacent houses found it necessary to let his dog bark all night. Parking close to the sea means enjoying the sound of the waves instead of the howling of the dogs."

Enjoyed a couple of drinks at the Cafe Dune, incidentally that is one of the outlets for the water supply tokens.  On a down side it seems that there are those that want to set it up as their own personal camp site and not leave."

But instead of having 100 liters there are about 70 and to make the cassette it is better to provide a can of water because the flow is really minimal from minimal. Other than that the area and very calm with the sound of the waves

10160,758931,3,RackhamderRote,29/12/2019,"This car park would be ideal if there weren't all these dogs barking at all hours (local, stray or traveler dogs)! Not to mention their droppings everywhere, in the streets, on the beach or in the dunes, sometimes placed under the eyes of their masters. A little respect for people and places would be welcome here."

10160,727109,4,Pinking,21/10/2019,"Location right on the beach was great, pitches ok - many campers seem to be here for longer. The baked goods from the bakery are delicious, great service. When it comes to dogs, the ghosts are different - you have to like it or leave it. However, we are appalled that right next to us at the booth a dog has done his big business and the owner did not care."
10160,715958,5,ShaunCCurtis,08/10/2019,"Two nights, views of the sea, quiet, Shop, excellent bread van every morning but Monday.  A little scruffy, but then most places are these days.

A few stray dogs but no problem also cats but also no problem. Looking like there could be a charge in the near future but that will maybe stop all the empty local campers from parking for weeks and blocking up this site. Looking forward to our next visit here to see the changes
10160,683658,5,RJK,09/09/2019,"Although not all pitches are equally beautiful: Such a free space directly on the beautiful sandy beach with cold showers toilet (9-19 o'clock) supply and disposal, garbage bins and enough peace many places would be good. Super!!"

Small supermarket but maybe come stocked up. Spotted a hairdresser for the girls and I did read at the local community centre you can get a shower for a donation. It’s by the church. Highly recommended. A few dogs about but they are from the local houses."

What a sad mentality to think you are allowed on a parking lot. Of course, they are French again and again. A good example of how to flout the spirit of the camping car. Gentlemen go to the campsite rather than pollute us."

You can make a beautiful route to the wonderful beach of Ursa, but it is an advanced level route. During the day there is a lot of movement and I do not recommend it. There are no services."

After that its quiet, unless its windy and rainy, in which case insert the ear-plugs. Still, nice to say that you've spent the night at the most western point of mainland Europe!"

10187,397323,3,Yeva_,22/10/2018,Good place to park up and explore the coastal walks and hikes to the the dramatic coves. But even at the end of October on a Monday it’s full of coaches of tourists and very very busy! We were going to stay the night but can’t stand all the people round the van anymore so are heading along the coast. Have been here since 10am and it’s been busy all day. Might be better to sleep here in the evening but the coaches will be back in the morning.

10187,382525,5,asad,26/09/2018,As soon as all cars with crowds are gone (after sunset) this is a nice and quiet place to stay! Wonderful if you can wake up with the view of the sea! Only edition: no camping behavior!
10187,342641,4,dagarkin,19/08/2018,"We slept in the asphalt parking lot under the lighthouse because the wind was buzzing on the esplanade and it was better. Even so on the esplanade there was an AC next to the restaurant, which was closed. There is a tourist office that at opening hours I think it has toilet but we do not use it. In this place we sleep three vans and some AC. Towards cold mogollon so we could not enjoy the scenery. I do not know if it was because of the persecutions but if I noticed a lot of car traffic at high hours of local people who went to the lighthouse ... it was the same for other shooting stars. In the morning at 8 the tourists start arriving. For the rest it is a place to remember."

I stayed one night, another RV joined me. Very windy, but quiet and silent. First bus comes at 8h. Arrive late afternoon cause on days with good weather, the parking will be full. The later you arrive, the bigger the chance for a space. No problem coming here with a bigger RV, mine is 7,5m. Beautiful view and nice walkings around. GNR passed early evening but made no comment, just looked and continued their trip."

Do you know that this is the westernmost cape of Europe? A photo at the foot of the column is needed, right? If it's clear, the view is ... grandiose!"
10187,102454,3,Schanet12,03/09/2016,"Nice location, but curious until 2 am that slam their doors and it starts again at 6am. Dust collectors are more discreet. Wind and thick mist, once raised, the view is beautiful. A bus from Sintra, climbs up there."

The parking is not stabilized but the beautiful sea view is reserved for guests of the restaurant, so park on the squares (flat) at the entrance of the cape, near the lighthouse (no sea view). The toilets are those of the Tourist Office, it will be necessary to queue and pay € 0.50 to use them."

The place is very well decorated, the swimming pool very pleasant and without supplement. There was no noise, either in the afternoon or at night. This place is just perfect for resting and recharging. Note that the pizzas offered by the managers are very good. Stunning sunset in the olive trees and stars all over the sky tonight. We took full eyes! We would have liked to have stayed longer. By far the best campsite we have done in Portugal…"

We did not look at the sign that prohibits parking in a small area, at 9 a door was knocking on a lady so we would move (fair). We moved the fire a few meters and that's it. At night, very windy. There is a bathroom but with a schedule."

Ca 200 m before small hike to dinosaur tracks, quite nice, but more beautiful and extensive seen in Italy / Rovereto.

I am alone, a young man came to make me dust to impress his beauty. It's 23:30, I'm going to sleep there. Too bad the restaurant is closed at 21h this Sunday evening, like the others around."

10528,3093641,4,AntonioM.V.,07/08/2023,"Ideal for overnight. We rested on Saturday night, the first week of August and we were only 4 campers. very quiet and perfect services. For €3 paying by APP you have all the services included. It would only need some shade to be able to be there during the day, we will have to wait for the trees to grow."
10528,2912405,5,45Cesar,01/07/2023,"It is all very new, a very quiet place, many services such as showers with hot water and toilets, (they would need some hangers), paella pans for barbecue if the authorities allow it, light points (although they are not yet in service, but soon they will be), emptied of gray water and filled with clean water, all very flat and accessible, some shade would be missing, but the trees will grow."
10528,2883143,4,MiquelLo,23/06/2023,"Magnificent area. Clean and well maintained showers and toilets. Two gray water emptying areas. very wide If you come during the week or out of season, you can take out the table and chairs and have lunch/dinner outside. Only, as the rules say, you can't do it if there are a lot of people. I don't give it 5 stars, because there is still no electricity. The pavement is earth/compacted gravel. I don't know how it will be if it rains. Thank you Benagéber!"
10528,2737337,5,rickimarke,09/05/2023,"Very nice and well-kept place. during the week it was absolutely quiet. Hot showers and clean toilets and all for only 3 euros. If you don't want to pay with the app, you can pay easily and without language skills at the city administration, which is less than 5 minutes away."
10528,2690084,5,vicenteleal,23/04/2023,"Very quiet area with a spectacular area, nearby swamp and rough routes through the town hall through the area, very clean showers and toilets, surely on long weekends and holidays it will be quite crowded but now total tranquility"
10528,2659890,2,jlhg1978,10/04/2023,"The place is fantastic, putting it to good use. There were cars, tents, caravans and motorhomes with open awnings (removing places for more colleagues who were arriving and leaving), chairs and tables and other mounted items, ropes with hanging clothes, It looked more like a campground to some. Then we'll complain when we can't go"
10528,2651821,4,MarilinaRibas,08/04/2023,"We have slept one night. It was full of motorhomes, campers, cars and up to three tents in the barbecue area. Very noisy, too many people. It looked like a campsite, chairs and tables, clothes hanging, we didn't like it but it was late and we stayed."
10528,2640672,5,Poessl600L,05/04/2023,"nice place, has everything you need (no electricity, is probably in preparation). Sanitary facilities clean. There were 5 other caravans there, so there was enough space today. Dogs barking lightly at night. Nothing for shade parkers - the place is exposed to the sun all day long. Was one night as a stopover, relaxing."

10528,2584193,3,stampanti,20/02/2023,"great place to stay, toilets and showers available. Gray and black water dump. no electricity yet, but that is in the making. spacious and good flat terrain. Put your shoes inside because there are foxes walking around your camper at night. Only downside is the barking of the dogs from the Village."

10528,2505143,4,feliperrutas,25/11/2022,"Payment through the app is easy for people who are used to it, for the rest there is the option to pay at the town hall. Worst of all, the night we spent there the light bulbs in the bathrooms were missing (I suppose foreign friends) and the water in the the showers, coming from solar thermal and because it was cloudy for several days, it did not reach an ideal temperature. Electricity not yet available."
10528,2471044,5,Mompe,30/10/2022,An area with everything you need to spend the night with toilets and hot water showers and barbecues. The showers need some hangers or benches to put clothes
10528,2462559,5,Ranchoneta,26/10/2022,"Very well conditioned. It costs €3. There will always be someone who complains (dogs bark, bells ring or the rooster crows). Impeccable toilets and showers, with hot water. Pay by application (if you don't know, pay at the town hall). Very well located, covered. Water loading/unloading (only electricity is missing, but the installation is already done). Grills, children's games, hiking and biking trails."
10528,2417393,5,DavidParker,02/10/2022,"Very quiet site, quite level, very wide, the town is small and does not have much to see. There are some dogs that bark for a little while, but immediately shut up or put on earplugs. Thank you Benageberg. I didn't make up my mind to pay the €2 in the app, I'm sorry, I've sent an email to the town hall."
10528,2399514,5,Lotus63,24/09/2022,"Yesterday afternoon, after a nice trip through the area, we drove past this fantastic motorhome again and everything was emptied and filled, including a shower. Everything looked neat and as far as the sanitary facilities are concerned, it is the intention that when you use it you leave it clean again!!! This also applies to the toilet, so flush it well until it is empty! Together this is a small effort."
10528,2291880,1,coletademelilla,23/08/2022,"bad, bad and bad after 20 km along a narrow and dangerous road we find a desolate esplanade used for rubble in full sun without shadows and terragal it is true that it has showers and toilets but there is no one who stays, it looks dirty and insecure we turned around and another 20 km to Utiel, too bad that they deceive us like that"
10528,2213607,1,sergiorimor,10/08/2022,"the area is fine, and from what you see, it will be better (construction) the only negative is the pool bar, there is no more unpleasant person to serve, not to mention that we spent almost 2 hours waiting for the food to be served. As for the small supermarket, everything was great and the service was successful, the barbecues in the area were good, but above all, do not go to the pool bar! It's the worst you can find!"
10528,2046955,5,bertuscb,07/07/2022,"Very good area next to a small town with lovely people, a bar with a great menu and a charming owner, the area has everything but current, excursions and viewing of wild animals a 10, application payment of €3 through application."

The only drawback is that the bar and the small shop do not have fixed hours. The townspeople are open and welcoming. I have been several times and I will repeat for sure. A 10 to the town of Benageber."

With black and gray drainage area, filled with water, toilets, showers and picnic area, it lacks light (a shame). From 1July you pay € 3 for parking (from the application, you will have the info when you arrive), it is worth it. In the middle of summer there were only 4 of us, the town next door. quiet area day and night. Perfect to see the sickles of Turia and Chorros de Barchell.

10529,3086743,1,park4ju,06/08/2023,"By far the worst night! Owner speaks only in his Spanish patois and makes no effort. Night hunting around until 2 am, dogs howling, gunshots… a set that is not worth 20€!!! Even if the view is pretty if you go to the top of the campsite. A swimming pool which is in fact a pond.. in short, we strongly advise against it!!!"

We have spent two wonderful days and are looking forward to more...the children have really enjoyed feeding the animals and being in contact with nature, the charming owner and the very clean services.

The electricity available is not for powering motorhomes but only for charging cell phones and the like, so there are reports of going down. The pool in my opinion should have more filters. Mr. Antonio very helpful. I will go back there."

Unfortunately no electricity, but we were alone in the middle of the animals and somehow it had charm even if everything is a bit rustic. 15€ probably a bit too expensive, but the experience was somehow worth it."
10529,1696159,4,brezenpapst,23/11/2021,"Lovingly laid out space in the middle of donkeys, peacocks, goats and cattle (well-kept). Everything is very ecological and sustainable, a small swimming pond, electricity only through solar (no electricity at night), waste separation.

Not sure if this is legal?"

Big problem was the lack of shade which made the stay impossible due to the high temperatures.

Partially shaded place. With bar, pedal boat rental. And the place is spectacular, with intense green and waterfalls ... I did not expect to find something like that. Of course, a lot of people when the heat hits."
10612,535639,5,SofiaEsz,01/07/2019,"It’s an absolutely wonderful place but camping is strictly forbidden. It’s okay to stay for the day, bit an overnight stay can result in 500 EUR penalty – at least for tents. We pitched the tent next to the van to enjoy the night sky and were and got a strict warning by the park security in the morning. There’s probably less issue with a camper van, but watch out for signs (and do not use a tent :) The area is an absolute treat! Beautiful trails and riverside."

Frankly it is great, however when camping because you must not take the wrong route to get there … and avoid going there on weekends because everyone comes to picnic at the nearby sanctuary and for once park n no matter how it is even more difficult to access it in CC."

It is worth visiting both the mountain and going down to the city by cable car (at half the price for being at the campsite). 2 adults and two children (9 and 3 years old) for two nights without electricity has not reached €25. The best of Portugal so far."
10675,3069705,5,nitxu,03/08/2023,Beautiful campsite in a unique environment. They have a pool and bar. Access to a good walk through the mountains and a discount on the cable car that takes you down to the city. We planned to stay one night and finally it was two. Highly recommended.

There was even a large camper. The bread service. Guimaraēs can be done by cable car or car, unless you like cycling. We definitely recommend this campsite. Admittedly perhaps a bit dated, but everything so clean and tidy."
10675,2648414,5,Marcoblau,08/04/2023,great site. Hard access. Note that Google maps takes you along a 2 m wide path if you come from Guimaraes. Heed the signs. Book before as it has little space for large caravans. Great receptionist. Old bathrooms but they do their job. They give you a discount for the cable car and for 4 you get the camping almost free. Don't miss the sun tracks from above

Arriving in the afternoon and watching the sunset from the viewpoints between gigantic granite rocks and walking back to your van is an unforgettable experience.

(Waze which will go shortest) Personally for the descent I put via Michelin caravan option ... cable car to go down to guimares, restaurant also next to the sanctuary (10 minutes walk from the campsite) we chose merinda and it is very good, as well as dan josé ... for guimarès next to the palace and castle you have mumadonna a typical Portuguese canteen at the top .... really nice nothing to say I advise for the stopover and visit of Guimarès"

It's not quite level. Next to the Civil Guard barracks, which has a camera focused on the street where the entrance is and you must also take something from the car park. A bit dirty and run down."
11101,1728503,5,vanandapram,07/01/2022,Stayed 2 nights. The spot is very quiet at night and an easy walk to the beautiful little town. A must is the croquettes at the Parador Hotel.

In our case on 10/15/21 no one came to charge us and we were there from 6:00 p.m. on 10/15 to 4:00 p.m. the next day coinciding with the weekend, I imagine that out of season they do not charge.

11101,1599196,3,ChispiVan,22/09/2021,"The parking itself is very good, level, quiet and very close to everything, the reason for giving it 3 stars is because the town is small and looks fairly fast, and I think it is very bad that you have to pay 6 euros yes or yes as a cheaper option (even if you are 30 minutes). The own controller of the blue zone confirmed to me that we were a group not very well seen here, there each one ..."

11361,3142352,3,Esmorga5,14/08/2023,We stayed one night and it was fine. Car noises can be heard from a nearby road but we didn't have any problems. Some areas of the parking lot need shims to level but in general fine.

11361,2977960,1,chausson032014,17/07/2023,"We parked for a few hours during the day while we explored the beautiful city. Decided against an overnight stay as the site not nice at all. Uneven,  potholed, muddy and fly infested."

11361,2825376,4,Dutchess1,06/06/2023,There are potholes but they cause no great problem. During the day it is busy with cars. Arrived late in the morning and slept really well with 12 other motorhomes. Felt safe as most of the cars parked are people working in the city. We did leave before 09.00 as the carpark was filling up.
11361,2783228,1,CarGar,24/05/2023,very noisy and unsafe

Better parking is found in the evening than in the morning, which is full of cars. There are always more motorhomes and it is very close to the center passing through the Roman bridge or through the exhibition center. Mercadona and Lidl next door."
11361,2745614,1,tonigoyi,13/05/2023,a place that is very bad with huge potholes. I do not recommend
11361,2738365,5,swangdao,10/05/2023,"The site is great. Next to the old town, very quiet and with a great sense of security since it is in sight. There is also a Lidl and a Mercadona nearby."
11361,2720754,2,jpranoux,03/05/2023,"We fled this location because it seems very risky to engage with a motorhome at the risk of being blocked or hitting other vehicles, especially VL. There were a few vans, but we didn't see a place to keep our CC which is only 6.80 m."
11361,2699704,1,Lbequet,26/04/2023,Our solar panel also got stolen during the night. Great location but better to avoid this spot.

11361,2459263,4,Monteanu,24/10/2022,"Ideal for visiting the city. Quiet place, perhaps some noise due to the proximity of the road. Going under the road, you can walk in 5 minutes to the Roman bridge, the best way to get to the city."

11361,2393942,3,danfjr1300,22/09/2022,5/5/22 Got lucky knowing how to park backwards my 7.80m and with shade. Narrow access and risk of being blocked by cars. Still have major holes in the road. Not recommended even if it means going a little further from the centre.

11361,2159462,3,Superchani,02/08/2022,It is not a very nice area to spend the night but it is central and quiet. Under the bridge better and there is also less light.

11361,2080671,1,Carlosb1,16/07/2022,"What the city council has done in collusion with the university with this area is an absolute attack not only for the motorhomes that we park there but for the inhabitants of this city in general. By benefiting the campsite, they have committed an environmental attack of enormous proportions, eliminating one of the greenest and coolest areas of the city."
11361,2052999,1,Campero6d2,09/07/2022,"We have found it closed with a fence from the local police, we assume that due to an event"

It is not difficult to find a flat place to spend the night, we slept on a Tuesday, maybe on the weekend it will be more complicated. Mind you, no service, not even a container. The city council of Salamanca can copy a little of that of Zamora or León...."
11361,1949339,1,tonigoyi,05/06/2022,A pity such a beautiful city that they do not want us from the motorhomes. the place under the bridge is indecency there is not even a garbage container. Due to the comments of some colleagues they have no intention of solving it now or in the future.
11361,1948311,4,CoraGarra,05/06/2022,"Good location for visiting the city center, the Plaza Mayor, the Cathedral and the University. This location is successful there are a lot of cars parking there. We were there on a Saturday night and there was no noise at night."

We were parked there as in the photo on the football field side, but another CC other than a van could not have gotten into it. Check before committing!"
11361,1917024,5,ManuAngyy29,26/05/2022,"I recommend it, it was the best place to visit Salamanca. Everything is at hand! In fact, if you are looking for a quiet place that is filled with people with motorhomes, this is your place."
11361,1910521,3,Mmmoustic,23/05/2022,"Close to the city center but on weekdays, the car park is full at 9am with cars at the risk of getting stuck. Noise late at night with the passages on the bridge. Nice riverside."
11361,1901988,3,Alanouille,20/05/2022,The car park was full at the beginning of May around 7 p.m. so we parked in the car park opposite next to the lidl and the mercadona and we stayed there for one night without incident. If you stay there just one night to visit Salamanca don't bother going down to the parking lot under the bridge because it quickly becomes full with cars and for large vehicles I think it can become difficult to get out.
11361,1900704,3,SigridPokorny,19/05/2022,"Looked good but when I was there there were only Spanish cars there, presumably on the sports field. I didn't want to spend the night there alone and went back to the other small PP nearby, which is always full and you usually have to wait for a spot."
11361,1888811,4,mamakunz,14/05/2022,The parking lot is always quite full. You have to rank something. The walk into town is perfect for a day tour.

11361,1876251,3,mikacox,07/05/2022,"Perfect parking to access the beautiful city of Salamanca. On the other hand we did not decide to sleep there because this place is under a bridge very frequented by cars. It also serves as a car park so a lot of comings and goings. Parking not very flat, with holes and puddles"
11361,1875111,5,Loreyvi,07/05/2022,"We have been three nights (Wednesday, Thursday and Friday) and we have been very comfortable. The ground is dirt, it is not paved and it has some potholes, but there are areas that are quite level. We have not heard noises or been disturbed and we have always slept surrounded by other motorhomes (on Friday there were 13). The best time to park is around 8:00 p.m. because that is when the cars leave."
11361,1842530,2,M73,21/04/2022,"Unpaved parking, irregular surface and if it rains with a lot of water accumulation. During the week it is used by workers in the area, when you wake up you are literally surrounded by cars. There are 4-5 ""squares"" on one side that if the free catches are fine. That if ... unbeatable location to visit the city."
11361,1833145,2,Rbkixu,18/04/2022,Tonight at 4 in the morning we have felt 5 blows in the motorhome. We have woken up suddenly and we have seen how another motorhome has started and left. Shortly after we heard another hit. We have called the police and they have come in 5 min. They have not stopped spinning throughout the night which is greatly appreciated. The parking is very well located but it does not give me security.

In addition, there are places under the bridge, so it is a good option to have shade. the only thing is the noise of the cars... but there is not much traffic."

11361,189637,4,centrodelsur,04/09/2017,Central parking without any type of service but close to the center and the bike path. A little noisy but bearable. We spent a very quiet night
11361,187967,4,momar,30/08/2017,"The ban was put in place because some branches fell from the trees on the day of the storm, which was very windy. We sleep well"
11361,187690,1,Cristt,30/08/2017,They have put a fence to not pass. There were cars but we do not know where there was another entrance.
11361,183900,3,familiayanezsantana,24/08/2017,Great to visit the city but it seems that people do not understand that it is not a campsite to put tables etc. it's a shame.
11361,183337,4,lylygreg,23/08/2017,"Quick access to the historic city center via the Roman bridge, a city worth the detour, we slept under the bridge, no problem, lots of joggers evening and morning. Very good for visiting and good for sleeping."
11361,183069,1,pat_cend,23/08/2017,We only used this parking lot to visit the city during the day. At night the place is not the most reassuring
11361,180202,4,elneno,19/08/2017,Quiet place and close to the center. We slept yesterday and it was almost full even under the bridge. It is nice to be there during the day for the shade.
11361,177198,3,bobdeniro,16/08/2017,Very ok to spend one night there no more.

11361,172739,3,paddyjwyatt,12/08/2017,"A good place to park for one night. We parked late and walked into the old town (20min) for a look around and dinner. It is close to a road but not that busy/loud. No facilities to speak of, however in the morning the sprinklers for the field came on and we managed to have a cheeky 'shower' in them."
11361,172597,5,IrinaEtMaxfontlaroute,12/08/2017,Great free parking right next to the city center. We spent a quiet night in the shade under the bridge and after a short tour of the city (which is very beautiful by the way) before hitting the road again. A supermarket (mercadona) is right next to Lidl 3 minutes walk.
11361,168888,4,prnjanuario,08/08/2017,Good place near to city center.

11361,151649,3,nathou86,14/07/2017,"Parking a little noisy, certainly, because close to the water, a park, a stadium and the city center, we spent a night and a day there... very well located for shopping (Lidl all close) and to visit Salamanca, a magnificent city with its lively pedestrian streets. No service (water, electricity)"
11361,148105,4,jeffcoicoi,05/07/2017,"Great to spend a night there. Arriving in the early evening, a tour of the city and its lively pedestrian streets is a treat."
11361,147691,4,Araneivan,03/07/2017,Parking well located for a walk to the center. He sleeps wonderfully. You have Lidl and Mercadona next door.
11361,146299,3,Sylvain21,28/06/2017,Very good free place for those who want to visit the city center. 15 minutes walk from Plaza Mayor. No amenities on site.
11361,131956,4,matachin,30/04/2017,Ideal for visiting the center of Salamanca. It has no services but it is free and very close to the historic center. To spend the night is a bit scary.
11361,115650,4,karine85,08/12/2016,"Parking very good, next to the river, not dirty at all as has been said in other comments. 5 minutes from the city which is beautiful day and night."
11361,112348,3,Icarias,30/10/2016,"Good option to spend the night surrounded by other ACs, nearby historic center."

11361,98942,2,Loka2015,23/08/2016,"Convenient parking for visiting Salamanca but noisy and dirty, trash lying around, an area worthy of the name would be welcome."
11361,98919,2,timath,23/08/2016,"Parking close to the center but a little too dirty, noisy and very tight (horn, flashing lights, party people,...) only deserves 2 stars"

11361,90629,3,manouchou,07/08/2016,"For parking in the city center it's pretty cool, there's a water point in the park, a super nice snack bar at the end of the park too. But then totally crowded (it’s August 7th when I say that) even though we arrived late around 10 p.m. We went under the bridge and in the end, it was good since we were in the shade in the morning. A little dirty but nothing more and no worries."

11361,60600,4,daniel67,02/12/2015,"The service area is located below the road, but the area was squatted by young people in vans. We preferred to sit in the parking lot in front of the Lidl, where ultimately around ten of us spent the night. Quiet, close to the historic center and a nice view of it, free, without service but you can't have everything"
11361,53144,4,dom.boutin,31/08/2015,"A stone's throw from the historic city center, cycle path a few meters away, rather very good for spending a night, lack of cleanliness but inherent to this type of place unfortunately."
11361,52750,1,2q2l,28/08/2015,"Travelers nearby, dirty and noisy place, we spent our second night in a campsite..."
11361,51450,3,marco6673,22/08/2015,"Not very welcoming, nor reassuring but ultimately harms peace and above all allows you to visit this superb city."
11361,51012,3,MARCO78,21/08/2015,Not a pleasant but worry-free night. A little noisy but a stone's throw from the heart of the city. Perfect for going out in the evening. Wake up among the joggers and their cars.
11361,43158,4,484olivier,21/07/2015,We're just stopping by for the day. Ideal place to visit the city. Recommended for a night without problem. Very easy also for free parking.
11361,27068,1,manegre@sfr.fr,28/09/2014,The parking lot is noisy and dirty. We preferred to park opposite in the parking lot near LIDL
11412,3199621,5,Harry_Bosch,22/08/2023,"The perfect place to rest and disconnect. We went to bed surrounded by cows and horses and we woke up just the same, on the shore of the reservoir. There is a small picnic area with tables and barbecues. If you bring a dog you have to be aware because there are shepherd dogs in the area."
11412,1957195,5,Davizyyo,07/06/2022,Splendid place!!! Surrounded by nature. Fenced recreational area (for horses and cows) with tables and barbecues.
11412,1953207,4,Andrea-Dinis,06/06/2022,"The site is beautiful, you can see the entire swamp, the green mountains and the meadows with the cows and horses. Despite the fact that the picnic area looked well-kept and the grass was freshly cut, we couldn't stay because there are quite a few mastiffs guarding the herds and when we brought dogs we didn't want to take any risks as one of them came running as soon as we arrived. Super skinny looking for us to feed him"
11412,1831193,5,ivanr1979,17/04/2022,"idyllic place, the pity that it is usually windy"
11412,1826266,5,Lachaume,16/04/2022,"Perfect for spending the day and night. Some hiking, cows and horses. Walkers and picnickers all very nice. Leave the area as clean as you find it."
11412,1502229,5,serparene,23/08/2021,"Perfect for sleeping. It is quite windy but there are very good views. The entrance is very easy and there are quite flat places. Be careful with the dogs, there are cattle and mastiffs but without problems."
11412,1071562,5,Juanangarcia,27/09/2020,"Idyllic place, a raisin of place, quiet and relaxing. The place is a little inclined but it is not a problem because the rest of the landscape and tranquility makes up for it. That if, when he says it was windy for a long time"
11412,1036271,5,furo_livewild,09/09/2020,If you are looking to totally disconnect this is the place! Absolute tranquility ... animals grazing day and night (a horse comes to greet you). Path to walk and sign forbidden to swim in the reservoir (a shame).
11412,1016528,5,tamagani,31/08/2020,"The reservoir was super empty and it was very cold for summer but the setting is beautiful. Dozens of cows mooing around at all hours, yes. Road at the narrow end where only one car fits but hey, there are some sidings"
11412,929473,5,Jotadiaga,04/08/2020,Very good site. Surrounding non-territorial cows and horses. In nature.

11412,745739,1,the_p_adventure,22/11/2019,"A lot of wind, a lot of wind, woke up to 2 hours impossible to return to sleep so the wind was strong. it made a lot of noise, the camper was shaken in all directions for hours."
11412,745652,3,the_p_adventure,21/11/2019,"The view is superb, but the gravel visible in the photos is the road. You have to park on the grass. Possibly 1 gravel spot along the road, see on Google Maps!"
11412,712445,5,apibericos,04/10/2019,Super nice and quiet town of Cantabria. Full of cattle. You can buy artisan honey and eggs in the house next to the church. I recommend
11412,657033,5,sam1881,24/08/2019,08/15/2019 Quiet and lonely place near a lake-swamp. Narrow road.

11412,393737,3,samsimillia,15/10/2018,"Beautiful location but quite a drive off the main road on windy mountain roads. High up so not the place to go when windy, like I did!"
11412,267399,5,NaoIR,12/06/2018,"Definitely was worth getting lost and finding ourselves in this place. We had a bit of bad weather, but even like that its gorgeous!! Surrounded by cows, horses and foxes :D"
11412,197148,5,AnaDisi,24/09/2017,"Awesome visits! fantastic place, we arrived at night and the curves and climb we went thinking if we chose the place wrong, but not at all ... x the morning we woke up with unbeatable views and surrounded by cows! We had a great time. Barbecue area and fenced picnic area so that cows do not enter. Highly recommended We're happy!"
11412,189386,4,Polaser,03/09/2017,Nice place to do some hiking and eat quietly in the recreational area
11412,185633,4,who,26/08/2017,It's worth getting out of the way to discover a place like this. Quiet night and bathroom in the reservoir.
11412,175061,5,hal9k,14/08/2017,Paradisiacal place to spend the night.
11412,170574,4,Marble,10/08/2017,The spectacular site but we woke up surrounded by more than a hundred cows!

11431,3240210,4,suset,30/08/2023,"Good place to spend the night, next to the river shared with cars that seem to not like our presence very much because they park anyway. It would be appreciated if we kept these areas cleaner so that they continue to exist."
11431,3226947,5,RocioMG,27/08/2023,"perfect, spacious area to spend the night and visit the town. Totally level. Many thanks to the council, they have a town worth visiting. All types of housing vehicles can access."
11431,3211261,4,Camperlodgy,24/08/2023,"Many thanks to the Valderrobres City Council for putting an AC area right next to the old town and not like others who put it on the outskirts. The only problem is that the cars do not respect and fill the parking lot. Service for filling water and emptying gray and black. And with the river next to it. Although the townspeople don't bathe, we do cool off with our dog."
11431,3175095,1,urdaburu,18/08/2023,emptying of black totally clogged space occupied by cars a pity
11431,3155474,3,Silviaflix,15/08/2023,"The place is fine, but the cars have taken over the area and you can barely empty it, you have to maneuver and enter from behind. In the best of cases."
11431,3077164,5,Orca_ma,04/08/2023,Thanks to the town of Valderrobres for the area. The only problem is that the cars do not respect the indication of AC and occupy most of the places. Very quiet night and one step away from everything
11431,3069124,5,YasminaAznar,03/08/2023,a spectacular site has water and to throw away the gray water
11431,3027467,5,lololaeti,27/07/2023,"5 stars because free space by the river with all services (except electricity). Relatively flat and shaded car park at the foot of the village. I don't have a review on this one yet as we are about to visit it but from here it looks pretty. I recommend this area, we spent a very pleasant night there."
11431,2993678,5,Luksemburg,20/07/2023,"Great place to visit the town, which is worth it, and also sleep. It is somewhat inclined and it may get crowded with visitors, but there is a place to collect water and release gray water and it is free. Nearby there are supermarkets and laundry."
11431,2984663,3,gio1965,18/07/2023,"Very dusty parking close to the town, shops and river. No shade, Fresh water and waste disposal available, but cars park very close making it difficult to get in or out, however ideal for visiting Valderrobres"
11431,2981920,3,Supein25,18/07/2023,"It is used to spend the night. Drinking water, gray and black. The best, that it is close to visit the town, the worst, that the cars enter without control. At night he gave them to come to listen to music, but luckily it was only for a while."
11431,2963430,4,raquelnaia,14/07/2023,"Area very well located to see the town, with some slope to go down but without problems, in the morning now in summer it gives some shade if you park in the area next to the river. They park cars and trucks, even covering the entrance or exit area to empty and making you have to maneuver, in the morning there is a lot of movement."
11431,2878871,4,lunaalonso05,21/06/2023,We have spent one night and it has been quite quiet on these dates. You have for dirty water and load some clean. It is very well located and has no unevenness. We recommend it 100%
11431,2839199,3,Paquimaat,10/06/2023,"Great for the situation. The bad thing is the smells of urine. At night there is a lot of movement, since it is shared with cars."
11431,2834256,4,AlbaGomGom,08/06/2023,It has no shade and is used as a car park. But overall it's very good
11431,2821468,3,Nataliavg,05/06/2023,"Good place to park in front of the river! But car access should be controlled, since there are many who do not respect this area for campers. Impossible to empty gray water, car badly parked!"
11431,2800990,4,HPM1961,29/05/2023,"We liked it here very much, it's a nice place and a nice place, thank you very much for this place, but I have to say that the disposal and cars parked there are true! Therefore 4 stars"
11431,2768442,1,SiempreNosotros,20/05/2023,"Thanks to the people for their willingness, but it would be ideal for someone to control access, since cars invade the area, not allowing parking or emptying water and boxing in large vehicles. The ACs are prohibited from parking and staying overnight in many places inviting us to leave. Therefore, where there are authorized places, you should be encouraged not to park cars. Thank you!"
11431,2751118,2,Lunila,15/05/2023,"It is an area and car parking at the same time with a lot of movement all day. very noisy. The emptying area was occupied by a car, so we couldn't use it. It is appreciated that there is an area but its operation is not clear to some."

11431,2742039,5,vod80,11/05/2023,"Great little spot for a visit to the old town. Long, steep slope out so you need to keep up the momentum!"
11431,2730020,3,jossean2006,07/05/2023,"Thanks to the town hall for the motorhome parking. There are things that can be improved. What is embarrassing is that there are people who think they are in a campsite, they take out awnings, tables, chairs, occupy several places and then we will pay just for sinners."
11431,2714974,5,ekwere,01/05/2023,"A busy parking spot, however very quiet at night. We had a great nights sleep and enjoyed the local area. A really lovely spot to stay."
11431,2713500,3,mrtxll1987,01/05/2023,"Very well located area but not exclusive to motorhomes, so there are many spaces occupied by cars and which even prevent the loading and unloading of water. As it was completely full, we went to the Castle parking lot."
11431,2705126,3,globetrotteraka1966,29/04/2023,Fairly busy cp where buses and trucks are also allowed. Night was quiet and if you have room you can stand with a view of the river.
11431,2693585,4,DarkCatLyon,24/04/2023,"Great views, but a lot of buses coming and going during the day. It is worth walking through the town, there are supermarkets nearby and we had a good night."
11431,2692450,4,trastorno,24/04/2023,"Good area. Good filling and emptying service. When we were, it was not crowded and we were calm. Good views of the town and a beautiful town. Let's take care of these places. Thanks to the town hall."
11431,2684307,3,Krambambuli,20/04/2023,"the SP is totally full of Womos and buses. Nothing of the charm of a few years ago. A pity. In addition, the completely outdated bright headlights..."
11431,2677769,4,AndreGriffi,17/04/2023,"Quiet area but very crowded. And they park cars and some buses. We spent one night and slept well. There is not much noise. Of course, there is a spotlight illuminating all night which is annoying. The town is beautiful. I recommend going to Elias's bar for dinner. Good wine and typical dishes. The lord is a good man."
11431,2670331,4,berlialo,14/04/2023,"The area is very good. In the center of town, with views of the castle and next to the river. It is flat and has a loading and unloading point. The only drawback is that they park the cars and take up space for the motorhomes."
11431,2664008,5,Angelpal,12/04/2023,"Everything was perfect, the first day we had to leave, it was full."
11431,2656002,3,CarlesCorbella,09/04/2023,Well located but a bit chaotic. Impossible to park at Easter. We went to the Sports Zone and very well.
11431,2650252,5,txustxika,08/04/2023,"Good site. However, if it is known that it is only for parking, why are awnings and chairs still being removed? We fit less and in the end it will close like in other places. Thank the city council for their effort. It would be great if the signage were clearer about sharing the space with cars. There are more and more of us and having more parking lots in the municipality, the area could be better delimited."
11431,2649213,4,supertrump,08/04/2023,"good place to park, with services and close to the town. For me, containers are missing and seeing the success of the parking lot, they should put another area upstairs. these days it looked like a campground. I wish all towns had an area like this."
11431,2647068,5,xanisu,07/04/2023,"Excellent place, excellent town. A 10 for the town hall for allowing us to park and enjoy this site next to the river. Awesome visit to the castle, lots of places to eat and drink. We will be back! Let's take care of all places like this."
11431,2642717,5,merit19642022,06/04/2023,"Perfect place, next to the river and in front of the town. Very calm. It is worth visiting the town, beautiful. The castle very well restored, magnificent views."

11431,1212074,3,josex2,23/05/2021,"Places are not delimited. It is a car park shared with cars and according to the signal at the entrance also trucks, luckily these no longer sell. Lots of movement during the day to be shared with cars, but at night it is quiet. Thanks also to the people for the service."
11431,1211653,4,Clawrence,22/05/2021,"It fills up very fast, there is a lot of movement of cars and noise."
11431,1210187,5,Legoneta,22/05/2021,"The spectacular site, very quiet and spacious. We arrived and there were about 30 motorhomes. And plenty of room. The welcoming town, highly recommended"
11431,1201120,2,marcguille,16/05/2021,Good for the emptying of water and water load. Now it is a car park not an AC area proper. Incomprehensible that the city council left its effort halfway.
11431,1191352,5,Latoni,10/05/2021,"I recommend it 100 for 100, next to Del Río, well located to visit the town that is beautiful and taste its cuisine, we ate tapas at the Maestrazgo bar and a super good variety of tapas and the owner gave us to try mushroom snouts and spectacular Buahhhh ."
11431,1179744,4,amporio,25/04/2021,Good site
11431,1167485,4,VanDame,05/04/2021,"Good area to visit Valderrobres. Next to the river. But as they have already mentioned, it is a shared parking lot with cars and it is a little difficult to find a place or maneuver because it gets quite full. There are no reserved or delimited places for AC"
11431,1165706,3,Lunila,03/04/2021,"The place is not bad, next to the river, a little noisy because of the nearby bridge. The problem, as they say, is that it is shared with cars and there were many, many more than motorhomes, even poorly parked which made it difficult to maneuver. The filling and emptying area is good, but we were almost unable to access it due to a poorly parked car. A shame because the site is good, they should reserve spaces for cars."
11431,1158983,4,fernandoter,27/03/2021,"The area is very good, but ... even though it has an AC zone there are many cars parked. Today, which is a normal Saturday, I have gone and there was no room for cars. Maybe the city council should paint the AC squares. The town is very beautiful, a pity that you cannot visit the castle or the church inside."
11431,1158625,5,josevg5,27/03/2021,Perfect for spending the night. Highly recommended. Shops and historic center next door. Thanks to the people of Valderrobles
11431,1152514,5,vanacardo,16/03/2021,"Very quiet parking to spend the night, next to the river and with views of the old town. Cars and caravans/camper coexist. There is water and for emptying gray. There is no bathroom. Gas station near the exit of town. Thank you Valderrobre for preparing this space!"
11431,1152224,5,lacarabela,15/03/2021,"Recommended, quiet area to spend the night, gray and black water emptied and filled, close to the river and the old town,"
11431,1148649,4,alexwein,08/03/2021,Large area and well located.
11431,1137471,3,tyrion62,14/02/2021,A very nice town the area is fine but they let cars park and it hurts us
11431,1112195,3,Yugular,04/11/2020,"The area is luxurious, very well located and with good filling and emptying facilities, but I give it three stars because it allows many cars, trucks, and even the Post Office van to park there and even makes access to the filling area difficult. and emptied. Some of the people walk their dog there, and then you find their pee on the wheel. Thanks to the people of Valderrobres."
11431,1111457,4,lmcorchetr,02/11/2020,Good ubication. There are no toilets.
11431,1109591,5,videovan,30/10/2020,Easy place to come with big camper
11431,1101093,5,Posala,21/10/2020,Superb area of location and services. And free! Valderobres is a beauty and not to be missed. Recommended 100%
11431,1098261,5,gostinnet,18/10/2020,"We had a perfect night, you can abide, you have no place, but above there is another parking lot. great and 100% advisable"
11431,1093420,3,tyrion,14/10/2020,The place right next to the river is idyllic. A few meters from a super eroski city and a day. Despite all the brown water drainage was completely clogged
11431,1091638,4,soquete,12/10/2020,"Shared area with vehicles, I arrived on 10/10 at 19:00 and I had to wait for someone to leave."
11431,1091539,4,tyrion,12/10/2020,"The ideal place next to the river and the medieval bridge. It does not have many places and the water area is located horizontally and not in battery, it can make it difficult to access qyan there are many vehicles. I highly recommend the guided tour that you can book at 649686311 or at the place you will find on the same main square as you enter through the stone bridge door. Visits at 10.30, 12, 16.30 and 18"
11431,1084685,3,clarey,07/10/2020,Beautiful town to see but aire is more of a general car park and busy with lots of cars coming & going - plus church bells.. Handy to see the town & supermarkets close by but for overnight I’d prefer somewhere quieter of which there are plenty of places nearby.
11431,1084442,5,AndreaKaz,07/10/2020,Perfect situation to visit the town of Valderrobres. Nice views from the river. Peaceful place.
11431,1080666,3,chanobas,03/10/2020,"It could be very good if it were really a motorhome area. But it is a car park where you can park motorhomes and spend the night. There are more cars than motorhomes. The filling and emptying area is in poor condition although it does its job. The spectacular site: next to the river and next to the bridge to enter the town of Valderrobres. But yes, in October we had trouble finding a place, I don't want to imagine in August ... The town, beautiful."
11431,1076247,3,Sissi22,30/09/2020,"Stop for the visit and lunch. Thank you to the municipality, but public parking is not always large and noisy during the day. At night it may be quiet, located along the Rio. Nice site to visit"
11431,1073749,3,JRM64,28/09/2020,Well located area. The problem is that it is shared with cars and you don't always find a place. Cars even park on the sides of the gray dump area so we couldn't unload. I think the City Council should be more severe to facilitate tourism in AC.
11431,1069555,3,LaLola_en_ruta,25/09/2020,"We have arrived early to take a place. Shared with cars, there is little space left. A Dutch camper has parked preventing emptying grays."
11431,1050772,5,Ceus2008,15/09/2020,"Magnificent place next to the Matarraña river, medieval old town, restaurants and bars just a step away. highly recommended. Guided tour of the town highly recommended, visit to the castle and church. Porticoed drinking area, very beautiful, beautiful town, one of the most beautiful in Spain. Thanks to the people of Valderrobres for this area of AC"
11431,1038344,4,beni340,10/09/2020,"Very nice town, and a parking lot very close to the beach. Unfortunately, cars or motorhomes park in the water fill / release area and make this task more difficult."
11431,1025328,4,Carbosueca,04/09/2020,"Very large parking lot, on land and shared with other vehicles. Fairly correct emptying and filling services. The downside is that the town's bell tower marks all the rooms at all hours, even at night. Nice town to visit."
11431,1021403,5,jlac,02/09/2020,"Phenomenal, in the center of Valderobres with all services"
11431,1012969,3,Barajalvarez,29/08/2020,"Area in a good area, but shared with cars and with soil with loose stones. It depends on the arrival time, it is difficult to find a place due to all the cars there are. The correct emptying / filling zone, but it would be appreciated to adjust the entrance a little to avoid the 'step'."
11431,1009266,5,Esther2018,28/08/2020,"Perfect area, next to the river and cool night. I advise doing the guided tour of the town. Pretty village. Gray and black emptying services and water."
11431,1008820,5,TeresaRojas,28/08/2020,"Excellent place to spend the night. Next to the historic center and the river, good services. Thanks to the magnificent town of Valderrobres for offering this service and also for free"
11431,1007253,4,CarmeJust,27/08/2020,"As a perfect A / C area, in the historic center, touching the river and leisure and shopping areas next door, but nevertheless very quiet, the only downside is that many cars are parked and this favors that at night bottles are made nearby and starting the engines continuously."
11431,1002326,5,MaiLi84,25/08/2020,"At the very entrance of the old town. Next to the river. It's pretty good, the only thing is that it fills up easily. The town is beautiful and the people are very nice. Good prices. Highly recommended."
11431,994429,4,cmlaura,23/08/2020,"It is appreciated that there is an area with free services in the area, because there is no more. To change perfect waters and touching the river, with a small green area. But it is shared with cars and it is super crowded in summer and is a bit cramped."
11431,966862,5,uxa,15/08/2020,"Located in an excellent place, near the town, the river and the health center. Quiet, flat terrain. If you arrive late, more difficult to park because they also park cars."
11431,918252,5,vilanova,01/08/2020,Parking next to the river and very close to the historic center. Highly recommended
11431,915177,5,AliciaGris73,31/07/2020,"Perfect. River next door, delighted children. Free water change, supermarket next door, BEAUTIFUL town."
11431,900551,4,euproctus,26/07/2020,"Large and flat, they parked quite a few cars in the evening. fill clean and empty gray and black. The village highly recommended"
11431,896398,5,juanreus,25/07/2020,We walked a perfect night very calm. 5 minutes is the very nice town. Aldo are the super. The only thing that I did not like is that they park a lot of cars and depending on what time you come you can not find a place .. For everything else perfect ...
11431,895855,5,samana,24/07/2020,"A 10 for this town that supports motorhomes. Ideal location, which invites you to go to town for a drink, dinner ... Supermarket 5 minutes away, which opens at 9:00."
11431,885853,5,rodrigo,21/07/2020,"All services, although it is almost impossible to empty gray water. calm and cool night. Very good town and restaurants."
11431,827289,4,losrastas,17/06/2020,"Ideal area to know Valderrobres and surroundings. We have been several days and great, thanks to the Ayto de Valderrobres. The only downside is the emptying of grays that park cars and you can not download."
11431,825032,5,JoseTeruel,14/06/2020,"Highly recommended area, close to the Old Town and shopping stores. Next to the Health Center. Very entertaining for children by the river. It is mandatory to bring mosquitoes and insecticides for the sunset."
11431,790203,5,furgo_negreta,03/03/2020,We spent 2 very quiet nights accompanied by other vans and caravans. Very calm. Supermarket very close. A good stop to visit the Mararraña. I recommend it. We will repeat.
11431,777392,5,RPBonaparte,07/02/2020,Highly recommended. Right next to the bridge to enter to visit the town. Very calm.
11431,776255,4,Rosie1955,04/02/2020,"A central Aire, close to a small supermarket and two bakeries. Looking a little shabby at the moment due to the winter floods from a nearby river but it has what you need for one or two nights. The town is interesting with the castle and bridge lit up in the evening. Be sure to watch out for the small blackcap birds and the bats flying around in the early evening. Would use again."
11431,775564,5,malamujer,02/02/2020,Very quiet place to spend the night and very close to the center
11431,775272,4,Gemmacomas79,02/02/2020,Pretty flat esplanade by the river overlooking the old town. Tonight we were about 18-20 vehicles. Quiet place to spend the night. Very pretty town
11431,774896,2,laurent84,01/02/2020,"Parking in town by the river, beautiful view of the castle and the old town, convenient for shopping. But next to a road and especially an iron bridge, noise"
11431,767346,4,Familiadecampistas,11/01/2020,"The area is wide, not delimited and is shared with all types of vehicles. Next to the River, near supermarkets and there is a path that takes you to the historical case."
11431,752858,3,viajandoennuestrafurgo,12/12/2019,"It is very close to the historic center, not being far from the same town you hear the noise of cars / trucks. It is shared with cars, which use it as parking (to take into account if it is weekend or according to season) we still have a good night. For those who travel by van, there is no WC."
11431,744127,4,graci,17/11/2019,"For me, the best one I found in the area of the Mataraña, is simple, water intake and discharge of gray and black waters, we spent two nights accompanied by several more motorhomes, thanks to the town hall of Valderrobres"
11431,739972,5,7g7g,08/11/2019,This is a beautiful place and the facilities are the easiest to use and fresh water and toilet rinse well away from each other. right on the river and plenty of space. only one other motorhome
11431,736018,2,josex2,01/11/2019,"The job was to leave, it was full of cars and cars. There was no place, the cars did not let out the AC's. We will try to try another weekend other than a bridge."
11431,732474,4,garaziazkue,28/10/2019,"The site is frankly good, level and very spacious. The town is past the bridge. We don't notice any bad smells or noises. Recommendable."
11431,723512,3,ducamora,17/10/2019,Free parking with services for gray and black water. Located next to the river and the center of town. Ideal to visit. The only downside was the bad smell there was. It was still worth it.
11431,692981,3,CanyonS,16/09/2019,"Well located to visit the town, although somewhat noisy and uncomfortable since it is a parking lot where there are many cars."
11431,690692,4,Monan,14/09/2019,"During the week it's fine. It's true that the road is close and it's a bit noisy, but we've slept well. Btt routes recommended."
11431,609800,1,ellypuente,08/08/2019,"I don't consider it an area, it's a parking lot, where you can sleep, we didn't do it, I didn't like them at all"

11431,589642,4,Rulipi,01/08/2019,"Perfect location, with all services, to put a but it could be land."
11431,529554,3,padraigl,26/06/2019,"This is basically a sand/grass/dirt carpark beside the river which gets very full at weekends. There is no shade and as its surrounded by walls, some trees and river bamboo, there is no cool winds in warm weather. Saying all that we had no mosquitos so we were very warm and happy.

There are services but people could not get their motorhomes in to use them over the weekend as they were blocked by cars. 
We went to use the services when we were leaving, but a car drove in and parked on the front of the ramp as I was about to drive on. Only I was going slow she would have hit me. I got out to tell the woman that I just wanted to do the services but she ignored me and left the car there. We had to leave without doing the services as we could not get in the other side and there is a raised concrete edge on the outside also stopping motorhomes.

I get the feeling that the locals don't like motorhomes in this carpark.

The town is lovely and the weekend had a ""romantic festival"" which was great to see and be part of.

We walked to Beceite and back, a 14.5km round trip. Its a lovely walk on dirt road, cliff walk, river crossings and dirt track into Beceite."
11431,527752,4,El_monta,25/06/2019,"Good example to follow for many municipalities. A good place to park with level ground, emptying service. 2 minutes walk from the tourist part of Valderrobres. Negative things: it has no shade and it is close to the main road, but it does not bother much the noise, in fact you hear more the noise of birds and frogies of the river :)"
11431,513063,3,LaPeque,12/06/2019,Perfect area to visit the village or spend quiet night. It has its drainage area and free filling. Close to supermarkets and restaurants.
11431,505495,5,WanderWebb,06/06/2019,Nice little area and really close to the wonderful old town. Bells continue to chime throughout the night but this is no problem for us.

11431,458472,4,Cfuenmar,18/04/2019,"Well located for the visit and quiet to sleep. But it is a chaos to park, it is a mixed parking for Trucks, Cars and Motorhomes. A zone delimited for us would be the most practical, some of us carry vehicles of more than 7m and it is difficult to maneuver. As a colleague says, sometimes they cover the emptying. For the rest all perfect, nice town and with shops just next to the area."
11431,445412,5,rochider,27/03/2019,Good place to visit the canyons next to the river and 100 meters from the bridge the only bad thing is that they also park cars and cover the drainage services

We spent one night with the van and we were very calm, there would be about 15 motorhomes and vans. The only downside is that the ground was muddy in some areas and there were puddles."
11431,406641,4,biancathevan,11/11/2018,Great place on the border of both the old and new part of the City. Just few minutes away is the supermarket and cafes. There are no public restrooms but some bushes nearby. We spend a very quiet night together with 8 other vans.

In general quite well."

11431,376306,3,Adamas31,17/09/2018,"Nice and free, with all services, thank you the municipality, but it remains, too, parking. For the municipality, thank you for reviewing the access to the service area, the border is really too high and presence of risk for motorhomes. Thank you again for the effort made to receive us."
11431,341576,5,hectorso,18/08/2018,"You can stay overnight (caravans included), so great. It's next to the river, so I guess it would have been enough mosquitoes (we slept with everything closed, so as not to risk it)"

Feed wild wild vultures that is above Valderrobres, but to go do not be guided by google because the route is not good.

11461,3256216,2,Jeromeverite17,04/09/2023,In his juice. the interest is just the access to the metro 500m away which takes you to the center of Valencia in 20 minutes. The sanitary facilities are old and average in cleaning. Small pitches.
11461,3239729,5,HarmonyOle,30/08/2023,"Great place to stay to visit the city of Valencia! Quite simple and practical...but that's all it takes for such a visit to the city!

11461,3123012,4,mpiva,11/08/2023,"Excellent value for money. The metro at 300 meters is really convenient, so even if it's far from València, it's worth it. Got a small pitch with no electricity, ok for us. Toilets and showers ok without too many pretensions. At the reception a very helpful and kind girl explains everything to you. They also make you tickets for the metro and the main attractions of the city."

Hot shower with pressure, great pool, nice location, friendly staff, close to Valencia, amazing restaurant (the best tapas I've eaten to date!) The pitch without electricity for 15 euros for two people!"
11461,3095244,2,tallmantrv,07/08/2023,"Dirty looking place, pay for water, very small places. im sure that if you ask 25 eur, create bigger plots and put a tap on the plot you can make more money as a camperpark being."
11461,3093774,4,Alcebral,07/08/2023,It fulfilled our objective of visiting Valencia. The pool gave us life with the heat that it was. The facilities could be improved but we feel comfortable to visit the city.
11461,3087515,3,lnf,06/08/2023,"Unattractive environment, fairly narrow pitches with little shade, decent sanitary facilities but reasonable price. Very practical for visiting Valence, leaving the CC in a safe place: the metro is a five-minute walk away."
11461,3077998,4,nathanluke33,04/08/2023,Good for €15 a night for camper 2 adults. Pitch quite a walk from toilets although clean but not very many. Very close plots but good for a safe place to leave van
11461,3064887,2,AVIVA50,02/08/2023,"In Favor: The price per day, a lot of shade, level plots, security and tranquility. The washing machines work very well. Against: WIFI very low speed. Bad TV reception. Bathrooms and showers, dirty very dirty. Staff, zero friendliness. Mini supermarket and bar, outrageously high prices. Pool, dirty and without Lifeguard Pets, they accept them, there is nowhere for them."
11461,3055191,1,Skyshield,01/08/2023,"The place is passable, not something to get excited about, they sell it to you as an exclusive place and the only good thing about it is the pool, which is nothing special either, it is not very clean and also, since it is shallow, it is too hot for this time of year... in addition to not having surveillance... What I liked the least were the very cocky ways of the staff and that they made us change places."
11461,3053274,4,Jesuscurado,31/07/2023,"all good to be able to visit Valencia. The attention at reception is excellent but the services are a little left out of the hand of God, they are fine but they are very noticeable over time with little maintenance..."

11461,2999660,3,samsa,21/07/2023,"It seemed magnificent to us when it was inaugurated, but the years have passed and they have wanted to cover too much with the same or less means than at the beginning. The common spaces are totally insufficient, the bar offers a basic service at excessive prices for scant portions, the plots do not offer shade and reservations well in advance do not offer any advantage."
11461,2991018,5,ristral77,20/07/2023,"The best area by far in all of Valencia. Good access, cleanliness, good communication with the city, good facilities, exquisite treatment of its workers and its directors, the bar offers you attention and good food.

Inside pool. Top cleaning and courtesy"
11461,2928011,5,Beatriz13,05/07/2023,"everything perfect and super friendly staff!! they have everything. We buy the metro tickets, tickets to the oceanografic and they explain how to get there. you can reserve bread and croissants the day before and at 8:30 you can pick it up. the water is warm. The only pro that I would put is that it rained with hail and we were at the bottom and the ground was puddled until the next day."
11461,2924298,4,AntoSFT,04/07/2023,Good location for visiting the city! Right pitches. Children's pool and to cool off. Welcoming staff. Bathrooms to improve.

11461,2916233,4,DesLegg,02/07/2023,"An excellent secure place to park if visiting Valencia with great Metro connections into city.
If you want a bigger plot book a double it is reasonable cost.

Noise from local dogs can be a problem.
Restaurant good but don't be seduced by the Paella."

Potable water possible to refill 0,50 euro for 40 liter, no potable water for free . The place is clean , the receptionists are very kind and helpful . For visiting Valencia is ok , if you don’t mind to spend almost 1 hour way to the city . Metro are usually one or two per hour . The place is quite during night ."
11461,2833242,3,Wpacolo,08/06/2023,"This Camper Zone is on the ACSI WEB, but they really do not accept it, since they do not respect the price of the ACSI WEB. It is more expensive and they charge you separately for electricity. Mr. Bar is good... and for a drink too. Fair cleaning bathrooms/toillet, very small for the people there. Good to visit Valencia, metro very close."
11461,2815417,5,jfrost,03/06/2023,"Love this place, visited many times, ideal location. Reception always very helpful. Toilets / showers are kept clean with plenty of hot water.

Pool is refreshing when open. We will be back again soon."
11461,2810727,4,Gudulin101,01/06/2023,"Very quiet place, hot showers in large and comfortable bathrooms. Sink for washing dirty dishes, paid washing machine and paid drinking water. Good food, not excellent. The only flaw, to go to the city you have to take the subway and it's 30 minutes away, they didn't let us get on because we had a dog and they hadn't warned us at reception that a muzzle would be needed"
11461,2809851,5,nzvan,01/06/2023,Awesome place and great value
11461,2802111,5,LCQR98,30/05/2023,A very good stop near Valencia with all the necessary services + laundry and snack. Do not hesitate for a second to stop there. See you soon on the road Christophe&Nathalie

Dirty drain area..... 4 people only parking without anything else, except for a fee, 19 euros per night 12.00/ 12.00.. Showers, they told me for free... but I didn't look at the conditions... Anyway, I try elsewhere sometimes even if the site can be nice, the first impression is very important"
11461,2786221,4,myichaliyna,25/05/2023,"Perfect camping to visit Valencia. Convenient connection by metro. It have all you need for visiting the city. We left our caravan there for 3 nights, noting happend, noting was stolen. Paid total of 76 euros for 5 nights. Fair price."

11461,2757209,4,vanhula,17/05/2023,"Good location for visiting Valencia! Only 300m away is the tram station, which takes 25 minutes to get to the center. With 17 euros per night (Acsi Card) also totally fair. You try very hard. But only 4 stars because the charm is a bit lacking and you can't walk the dog well. But that's fine for a couple of days, because the city is highly recommended!"
11461,2753305,2,Pablo007,16/05/2023,"Quiet site but very dirty toilets, no hot water on morning of departure, day we arrived a Dutch chap had a bike stolen so security is bad and chap on reception not very welcoming ideal for going to Valencia but whole surrounding area and site dirty"

11461,2732293,4,Martybhoy,07/05/2023,We paid extra because impossible to get level on the cheaper plots. Nice place just a bit far out from the city. They sell tickets for buss at reception.
11461,2727549,5,ivocato,06/05/2023,"Without a doubt, the best thing is the restaurant! Water 50 liters for €0.50. You can choose plots with or without electricity. The great deal sells you tickets to Valencia and they explain everything to you."
11461,2723240,5,Eugenio61,04/05/2023,Best Camping to visit Valencia city :) 100% recommended
11461,2723208,3,BecksnBarry,04/05/2023,"A very useful site for visiting Valencia as the metro is only a 5 minute walk away. You can buy tickets at reception - very helpful. Toilets and showers ok, good WiFi and a nice little bar/restaurant on site. Pitches were cramped - but then again only €13… Biggest problem was the noise, resident kids kicking balls against bins til 10pm right outside the van. Not a relaxing site - but practical."
11461,2718041,3,GandT,02/05/2023,"Cannot get that excited about the site.  Located in a scruffy little area near a tram stop. Really does need a big clean up around  the place gives such a bad impression. Our pitch was used as a cut through footpath by others so no point in us paying extra, even though discussed with site staff nothing was done about it. Disagree with aqua policy. Next time we will find an alternative."
11461,2716910,3,Fer1972,02/05/2023,"We stayed 2 nights and they charged us €18 per night for the plot with electricity. The pitches are just right for the motorhome and a table. It has the convenience that you can buy the 10 metro ticket there for €18, it is a little more expensive than at the ticket offices, but the only thing is that if you have extra trips, they will refund the money for those you have not used and for the payment of the card."
11461,2715602,5,indigovan,02/05/2023,"This square is ideal for visiting Valencia. Everything a camper's heart desires is available. At the reception you get all the information and the tickets for the metro, which can be reached in 5 minutes. The facilities are kept simple, but always clean and hygienic. All this at a price of 13 euros without electricity is unbeatable. #indigo_van"
11461,2714772,4,anettes,01/05/2023,Perfect for a stay to visit Valencia. metro station close by. Restaurant and bar on site. not pretty but practical..
11461,2713437,5,VicMc,01/05/2023,Totally recommendable both for visiting Valencia and for making a stop along the way and being able to tune up the vehicle and rest as it is close to the AP7.
11461,2703743,5,Hymersnobs,28/04/2023,"I was truly impressed by this site, the basics are done well, clean showers etc, it has good WiFi, a bar with draught beer and good food. it's only 5minute walk from metro which gives you access to ValenciaHistoricCentre. However what really pleased me was the willingness to help, from the getgo it seems your satisfaction is their highest priority. Buy your metro/tourist tickets at reception too"

11461,2695941,2,Titilochrist,25/04/2023,We had a not very pleasant night. Dog barking all night long. The welcome is friendly and the proximity to the metro is great. The toilets are clean. Too bad for the sleepless night due to the dogs.
11461,2695274,4,Hanse.Bulli,25/04/2023,Really highly recommended. We stayed here for one night. Great for exploring the city on the metro. One star off as there are few showers and toilets for the amount of people. But everything very clean. There is no hot water at the sinks to wash dishes.
11461,2694843,5,inmalabrador,25/04/2023,"Super camper park! It is ideal to visit Valencia! You have the metro next door that takes you to the city center, we went on a scooter that we took in the caravan but you can also go by bike. Carlos is very kind and explains what you need. We have spent one night but we would have stayed a couple more nights if we didn't have to leave. We'll be back for sure."
11461,2693686,3,laurafer,24/04/2023,"Area with all services, easily accessible and next to the highway exit. Metro next door to go to Valencia. Acceptable bathrooms. Friendly staff help you with what they can. Silent and calm nights. One BUT, the clean water hose next to the toilet is why we saw several ACS use it to clean the poti. They should watch that."
11461,2686298,1,KuhMuh,21/04/2023,sadly had a very bad experience with a staff member after an honest misunderstanding. ruined our stay there. WC is very clean.
11461,2685576,4,maxgent,21/04/2023,"Very convenient place to visit Valencia and its surroundings. Spaces a bit small, services not scaled to the number of guests, not very clean. Friendliness at the reception. We also toured the València countryside with the scooter, including the Sagunto area."
11461,2684255,5,costa-willy,20/04/2023,"Excellent rest area, comfortable pitches, friendliness, hot shower included in the price, very clean toilets. Definitely going back"

11461,2679148,4,maviperdomo,18/04/2023,Good place if you want to visit Valencia. Subway a few blocks away. Good services. I recommend it
11461,2672075,3,faye123,15/04/2023,"Good location for visiting Valencia. €15 for 2 ppl without elec. 5 mins to the metro (tickets from reception) spaces are close together. Showers included - only 3 per gender which isn’t enough for the amount of people here so the cleanliness suffers. toilets smelt horrendous. One bay for grey water, filling up etc. 40 minute queue during the morning. 50c for water so make sure you have change."
11461,2671253,5,Bilou36,15/04/2023,We stayed there for two days... A little in its original condition but with very decent sanitary facilities. A very friendly and professional welcome. Very well placed because five minutes from the metro station. If you have bikes: it's only happiness. You can take them on the metro and then visit the city because Valencia has an extremely dense and well-made network of cycle paths
11461,2670686,4,felibea,14/04/2023,"Good place to spend a few days, clean and very good attention. To put a hitch, the gravel floor that is quite dirty and the pirate cook who seems to not like to work."
11461,2666371,5,fermejuto,13/04/2023,Very good place to stay with all the comforts and services.... Excellent food and very friendly service. Truly recommended.
11461,2663839,5,moustaches31,12/04/2023,"Very good for camping car, delimited, flat and stabilized pitch. We paid €18 for a 2-person car with 4amp. Please note that the prices are different depending on the vehicle, trailer, number of people, electrical power and time of year. Emptying and filling are free for residents, you can fill the pot with water"
11461,2660208,4,BTS1980,10/04/2023,Recommended and with many services. The employees are very friendly and willing to help you with any problem. we will be back
11461,2652425,5,Lorena83,09/04/2023,"Clean, good rest. It's nice to find sites like this."
11461,2643457,4,AngieLu,06/04/2023,"In mid-March I was in this place for three days because I met friends there. I wouldn't have gone there without this reason, because at 15 euros it would be too expensive for the services offered. However, it was good that I could stand in front of the actual pitch, as it was a bit more pleasant there and not in plots without greenery around it like in the courtyard."
11461,2638076,5,Hycamp,03/04/2023,"Very friendly and helpful staff. Important for dog owners, dogs must be in a transport box on the metro to Valencia. However, the lady from the reception got us a dog taxi. Up to the old town 35 €, that's perfectly fine."
11461,2634456,1,Rossicristina,01/04/2023,"Arrived around 10pm, pitch cannot be called, they made us park in a square at the entrance and stop, there's no electricity... and water far away near the reception, say it first, right? I was wrong not to ask. Paying 15 euros to park seems like a lot to me."
11461,2633074,5,ali_mit_a,01/04/2023,"A super pitch to visit Valencia. At this time of year it worked spontaneously (without electricity) for us. The metro is close by and if you have one, you should definitely take your bike with you. The front desk was very friendly and everything was explained very well. We also got the metro tickets directly there. It was very quiet at night and the toilets and showers are clean."
11461,2631356,4,mherrm,30/03/2023,"Great pitch to visit Valencia. Small deduction, since there are only 3 showers per gender for the large pitch. Otherwise in the low season tiptop, for 13 euros per night without electricity."
11461,2626997,4,LorraineundManuel,27/03/2023,"€17 on the weekend during the Fallas, during the week you only pay €13 without electricity. Perfect connection to Valencia. Showers could be cleaner but are huge."
11461,2625776,5,Cachorrita,26/03/2023,2 perfect nights. all services included. showers with real hot water!! Carlos receives you charming !!!
11461,2625456,4,JenniferRuiz,26/03/2023,"I recommend it for people in ♿. Low price per night, bar, small market store, complete toilets (washbasin, shower and WC) including adapted ones, washing machines, sinks, services for caravans, children's playground and also for exercise. The best thing was the treatment of Carlos, the receptionist, who was super friendly and we will repeat without a doubt. Pitch without electricity, minicaravan and 2 adults for €13"
11461,2624633,3,steve746,26/03/2023,Excellent to visit Valencia. Shower and toilet block could do with updating although hot compared to last year the cleanliness was rather disappointing. All other facilities OK.
11461,2624361,5,Tvc,25/03/2023,"Good camping to visit Valencia, especially because of the close metro connection. 13 euro a night for a small spot without elektricity, clean and hot showers. A bit larger than we like, but ideal for a city camping!"
11461,2622927,4,Biscuits,24/03/2023,"Excellent place. Shame not all plots have electricity, that would have made 5 stars. Good size pitches. Nice bar, pleasant service, great showers. We’ll be back to test the metro to town next time."
11461,2617863,5,RM73,20/03/2023,"Very good place. top staff, some spoke French. With the metro, ideal for visiting Valencia and my family who live around. We were supposed to stay 3 days, we stayed the week. Many thanks to all the staff and the lady in the restaurant"
11461,2617835,4,FamilieSchlenkerbein,20/03/2023,"Very good pitch for visiting Valencia. Sanitary rooms are clean. The food is regional and super delicious! Reception is multilingual, has lots of information and is incredibly helpful. Info for dog owners: Dogs are only allowed on the train in boxes up to a certain size. Alternative is a dog friendly taxi. Reception helps there too. We'd love to come back!"

11461,2603248,3,Gopvan,08/03/2023,"Recommended area. Very correct services and level plots. A good option to go to the center of Valencia, since there is a metro stop a 4-minute walk away that takes you and you arrive in 20 minutes. Reception explains everything very well. The only reason it receives 3 stars is because the price is somewhat high (€20 per night-plot+current 6a and to refill water you have to pay 50cent x 40l)."
11461,2603073,4,OmiPetra,08/03/2023,"Good place to explore Valencia, train stations 800m away, supply and disposal is ok, small snack bar is available, food is ok for the small appetite, price-performance could be better,"
11461,2600915,3,Reinhard190854,06/03/2023,"I had to pay €25.00 per night for a small pitch (36a) without electricity! So be careful with the prices! Otherwise okay, access to the metro Valencia only five minutes away. Front desk friendly, English speaking, no German. Seats are assigned."
11461,2600873,5,CharlotteRob,06/03/2023,"We stayed for 2 nights without electricity €15 per night. Reception open until 10pm which is great if like us you're arriving late.

The site is quite big, the pitches spacious enough. The facilities are clean.

The staff were really helpful with information on the metro and how to get into Valencia. Given the price no complaints."
11461,2598198,5,Pik24,04/03/2023,Top service. Places aren't really private but the location and price makes up for it
11461,2597506,4,FredFlintsone,03/03/2023,"Friendly welcome, super organized campsite. Despite the many guests, the sanitary facilities were always clean. shower is hot The train connection to the city is great. Tickets are available at the reception. We got the last place - unfortunately it was very small and sloping."
11461,2597459,5,ValetJb,03/03/2023,"Very practical cc area, metro 300 m away and possibility of taking your bike on the metro to visit the city of Valencia. At the reception, Carlos welcomes you with good humor. Everything is super organized. The information is clear and available in French. Showers comfortable and hot. Please note that reservations are recommended even on weekdays out of season. I highly recommend this place"
11461,2597403,5,padraigl,03/03/2023,"Fantastic camper park with fantastic people at reception. Very good hot showers with good wifi. 
€34 for 2 nights

but the main message.....
if you take the train to valencia you must wave it down at the station or it will pass. Also on the way back you must press the button 'b' at the door for train to stop at station or it will continue to betera. The stations with the dot you have to do this."
11461,2597375,5,Basoline,03/03/2023,A very complete camper park. Gravel/gravel surface. Fairly flat. Good Wi-Fi. This place is very well taken care of. Possibility to park camper in closed area. Paella seems to be good from the restaurant (other visitors have told us). Tram stop Valencia around the corner. Service of campsite high. I would come back! Recommended. No comments.
11461,2596822,1,Ratenfaenger,03/03/2023,"Disappointed for our second visit. 1st time everything was perfect our place well reserved. this time no reserved place with a cc of 8.5m (specified when booking) we offer to choose from a few unsuitable places that are too small. After discussion we were able to find a place (where the tv did not pass, difficult with a child). We shortened our stay with them."
11461,2593776,5,dankoap,28/02/2023,"We have been on the Andalucia bridge. Upon arrival we were attended by a very friendly girl and the rest of the days Carlos. Carlos explained to us how to use the card and where to get off the metro to visit the city of Valencia. Very nice and friendly. The trips you don't use will refund your money. The area and the staff are great. The metro stop is super close, 5 minutes walk. We will return for sure."
11461,2592353,4,Txinguis,26/02/2023,We have spent 2 nights in this camperpark. All the services. To go to the center you can go on the subway and in the campong they sell vouchers with several trips that you can later return the ones that are left over.
11461,2583794,4,montanja,19/02/2023,"Perfect for your visit to Valencia. In February it was one of the few places that still had availability (at 16:00, only without electricity). The services are really nice as are the people working there. Only downside was that the toilets/shower were far away for us and that the WiFi didn’t work sometimes. We paid 13€ per night, it was 30minutes by metro to Valencia (1,80€ per ride)."
11461,2580554,4,BriJoVan,17/02/2023,"Very clean, very friendly, well organized and perfectly geared towards campers. You can also buy & swap Spanish gas bottles, and a necessary Spanish gas attachment can also be purchased here - there are even the necessary German adapter pieces for the gas connection! The service is just great. However, the plots were a bit too close together for us. Otherwise GREAT!"
11461,2578769,3,monilion,15/02/2023,"Very good heated sanitary facilities with large showers like a campsite. We paid €28 per night for a comfort pitch with electricity booked online €1 for 80l of water. A little expensive, does not match the description"

Showers and toilets clean, hot water. Catering on site, paella to order for the evening (9.5€ per person). We paid €30.4 for a CC, 2 adults, 4 Amp. (5% ACSI discount) two nights."
11461,2574972,3,Golonko,11/02/2023,"I don't know why it is not classified as a campsite in park4night. The only difference I suppose will be the price for Ac. In any case, it is very far from Valencia. On the other hand, it is ugly that they charge for water to fill the AC."
11461,2574393,3,pepepepone,11/02/2023,"A good area, to visit Valencia, it's fine, quiet, friendly workers and they explain well how to move around Valencia, with a video and personally if you have any questions, meters nearby, everything was cleaned and 5 very quiet nights, we'll be back, thanks to everyone staff ."
11461,2574063,1,ccdonctoi,11/02/2023,"too expensive for what it is, moreover they pass it off as private individuals. I immediately point out that this is indeed a campsite and that the price indicated does not correspond at all to what is written on their site. so if you're French run away from me now"
11461,2574017,4,PlanTravels,10/02/2023,Great site with all the facilities we needed. friendly staff and helpful. we had problems with WiFi for two days but they let us move to another pitch which solved our problem.
11461,2573116,4,sougmi,09/02/2023,Area well located for visiting Valence but far enough from everything if you have no means of transport. Metro station 5 mins. walk. Relatively well maintained area even if the toilets are starting to age but are clean. 50ct for 40L of water. Small convenience store with delivery of bread on order even in this period. Friendly staff.
11461,2571760,5,Störti01,08/02/2023,"A good place for two days with everything you need. Unfortunately it rained too much so we couldn't visit Valencia. But we'd love to come back to catch up. The showers were big and clean. Very friendly people at the reception. Even though we didn't have a reservation, we got a seat."
11461,2571362,5,4WTravel,07/02/2023,very nice place. Professional operators. Only about 300 meters from the metro station. Ideal for visiting Valencia. Small restaurant.

11461,2557539,5,hhollstegge,22/01/2023,"Top! Value for money unbeatable! Friendliness of the staff, cleanliness of the sanitary facilities, etc. too. The metro runs at longer intervals, about every half hour. A tourist ticket for 12, 24 or 72 hours is worthwhile if you also want to be mobile in Valencia by bus. You also get 2 tapas and 2 drinks for free in certain restaurants."
11461,2557255,4,roozbeh,21/01/2023,Everything was ok. Toilets could be renewed. Good connection to the city. Wifi is very Good.

11461,2551284,4,MarKer,14/01/2023,"Great facility. Good service. Ticket sales for the metro. Great explanatory video about visiting Valencia. Water costs extra. Restaurant too small for so many pitches. Probably the safest option for visiting Valencia, reading reviews of other places."
11461,2548863,2,LoloMimilSoso,11/01/2023,Okay. It's just a parking lot with a convenience store. Very difficult to access for drainage and water (paid) Only 3 female showers for 78 pitches. Obligation to take 2 pitches for caravan & car. That is 26€ per night instead of the 13€ planned. No reduction for a second night. 52€ for 2 nights it hurts! Noisy dog all night.
11461,2548128,5,Chantal33,10/01/2023,"Great for visiting Valencia. Metro 5 minutes walk and then 20 minutes to reach the city center.

11461,2543642,4,marielcaramel,06/01/2023,"Friendly staff. Well organized. 
Heavily fluctuating and unreliable WiFi and LTE. Showers ok. Good service station. 
Depending on your pitch, don't expect to sleep longer than until 8, because that's were the first campers drive to the service station, to which they need to drive across the whole campsite."

Possibility to purchase tickets for the metro and oceanographic. Cons: 30' by metro to reach the center of Valencia and there are 2/3 trips every hour. Paid water load (50 cents/40 litres). Not brand new services.
11461,2529269,1,BostjanKoren,27/12/2022,"Hello, I don't know where the 5 stars came from! Maybe because you have to pay 60e for the stay in advance!, or because the fuses are only 4A, or maybe because they have 3 showers for the entire camp!, 3 toilets, 3x urinals, maybe because  because the wifi is free, but it doesn't work! The only girl at the reception deserves 5, and at the end, the water for the paychecks smells of chlorine!"

Spaces are narrow and cramped, no major issue and you can pay more for larger pitch. WiFi in our pitch was low quality, unable to stream Netflix.  Restaurant prices were a bit high. 50c for water refill which should really be included in price."
11461,2498177,4,MarkJager,17/11/2022,"The loading and unloading area is very inconvenient. Standing in line with 4 other campers is normal, since everyone has to get off before 12 o'clock. Spots are narrow. Sanitary clean, wonderful showers, washing and drying works perfectly. 24 euros per night (with 3 kids) is very expensive."

11461,2452980,4,Goerch,20/10/2022,"Very good parking space with all the necessary supplies. The tram is just around the corner, however, the transport connection could run longer. Safe storage is guaranteed here. Tickets for the train are available at the reception."

Only the slightly longer way into the city bothered us a bit, since there are only a few trains, especially at night. Important: Press “Stop” at the stop so that the train also stops. Unfortunately, we drove past the bus stop once."

The nice team from the campsite organized a taxi driver for us, who took us and our dog to the center and picked us up again at night (one way around 35 euros)."

11461,2270012,5,Hartzatxo,19/08/2022,"Highly recommended area, to stay and take advantage of visiting Valencia, the metro is a nuisance since from the area to the connection of the seminari metro station there is not much frequency, from seminari to Valencia it goes much better and the return is the same, until Seminari-Ceu well and then it depends on whether you get to cooking well since there is little frequency"
11461,2268509,5,majico71,19/08/2022,"We stayed two nights, we took the opportunity to spend a day in Valencia visiting the Oceanographic, you can get tickets in the same area.

To go to Valencia we took the 2 buses and metro that they have put in place as a substitute (€12 and a little) and it took us 2 hours to get there and 2 hours to return. To go to the oceanographic, the same campsite was in charge of reserving the taxi the day before, €32 to go and Uber to return €34."

Right now the subway was under construction and it complicates the connection with the city by public transport. Little shade, but to go out in the morning and return in the afternoon to rest from being a tourist is great."

11461,2166540,3,Wouter1313,03/08/2022,"We came here by chance as there is a pool during the heat. This is why we stayed 2 nights. The spots are very narrow, I didn't have a meter of space next to the camper because I couldn't move far enough due to a tree on the other side. And for a price of € 22,- including electricity, 6amp, you can expect that the drinking water is free, but unfortunately. Gave a ghetto feel."

Nice and helpful owners.
11461,1771313,2,Acei81,02/03/2022,2 stars for the price without electricity because the pitches are small and with low trees and slopes worse than a tin of sardines When we arrived we were placed in 29B but 29A takes up the whole place 1st come 1st served CQFD 1 night in the parking lot (not worse) not reported 0.50€ for 40L of water dogs barking at night I do not recommend or just for 1 night

The bathrooms are very good, it just happens that when more than one person bathes, the hot water comes and goes. The sinks are very good, the only thing there is that people are not very clean because they leave food dirty on their plates and they don't want to wash there anymore... apart from that everything is excellent!"
11461,1764855,2,CarolinaGimenez,24/02/2022,"We went last weekend as we had a performance in Paterna and we booked it to spend the night for sure. At 10:30 p.m. they close the fence and you can no longer access it with the motorhome (but you can walk) since they do not give you a key. How were we going to come back later than that time, we had to leave and we couldn't sleep there, despite having already paid. I'll let you know in case someone else has the same thing happen."
11461,1764583,5,TinaLintz,24/02/2022,"We stayed one night and all services are operational. Showers with hot water, what a luxury! WiFi very good, spaces large enough. Small minus in my opinion: the lack of vegetation. Thank you !"

Don’t know what the guy before me was whining about, but we stayed there the same day and the toilets were clean. Yes, paying for drinking water is a bit odd. We paid €0,50 which is supposed to be 40 litres, but we managed to fill up our entire 75l tank."

11461,1696982,4,ChallengerRM,24/11/2021,"A well-arranged camper place with all the trimmings. An English speaking receptionist, an extensive map of Valencia including a video explaining the metro. The sanitary building is spacious and the showers are really lovely. Only the garbage dump... Gadverdamme!! So filthy it gives you nightmares. For the money you pay per night, this is extremely bad."
11461,1693423,4,kristinaEH,19/11/2021,The plots are spacious and it is very good to visit the city of Valencia. The toilets need updating but the water was great. The attention at the bar was very nice. It should be known in advance when it is high season because prices vary. And the week of November 8-25 it was. Strange. on
11461,1686764,4,teeneeweenee,12/11/2021,"Nice and helpful staff, 5 minutes by foot to the metro (about 30 minutes to the city center) Sanitary facilities in order, clean. Unfortunately, there is space on the street, a bit noisy here, but okay. Good WiFi everywhere. Very good value for money"

11461,1668971,5,Miguelo68,30/10/2021,"A very complete campsite, with good facilities and very friendly staff. With nearby metro stop to visit Valencia. At the same reception they sell tickets for the metro and the different attractions that you can find in the city of Valencia."

Very friendly staff and next to a Metro stop to go to Valencia. But it is advisable to book online before going, because when they fill up you stay out"

11461,1658715,5,nollis,23/10/2021,Stayed here for 2 nights. We can only recommend the pitch ... great with pool ... restaurant very tasty. 2 minutes to the metro direction València (30 minutes). Very nice staff. Showers and toilets are okay. We will be back.
11461,1657567,4,MF1,23/10/2021,€12 without electricity (further from showers and kitchen but nicer part of site) short walk to metro to visit Valencia but other than that nothing in this area to do there are no nice walks as roads too busy

They sell you the ticket card at the reception. The stay, motorhome and six people € 27 the simple plot with light per night Very quiet on these dates and that it was complete"
11461,1638658,3,chispeantes,11/10/2021,"Many plots are very uneven, at least the ones at the entrance. There are others, the ones closest to reception that are fine. In the bar they have very good breakfasts of toast with tomato. To fill the AC the drinking water costs 50 cents the 40L. We would repeat because it still seems the best in the area. Oh, and the direct metro to Valencia is 5 min next door."
11461,1635736,3,pasdebols,09/10/2021,"Arriving today we paid for a week, and we already regret it. deplorable sanitary facilities shower with curtains, barking dogs, small location on top of each other. constant passage of vehicles, CC all day. nothing ideal."
11461,1634080,4,Sven1972,09/10/2021,Ideal parking space for a tour to Valencia. We stood here for € 17 per day including electricity for 2 days. The way to the metro is not far and it takes about 30 minutes to get to Plaça d'Espanya. Tickets for the metro are available at reception.

11461,1604369,4,schnickers2000,24/09/2021,"Quite tidy, even spaces, clean showers, toilets and pool. We are still testing the metro, paella and bread service, there are metro tickets available at the square. Unfortunately, the places are not as specified 9x4.5 m but smaller. You have to park a trailer in another parking lot or you pay € 5 extra. Otherwise great for 15 € including 4A electricity and quite quiet when all the mobile homes are parked."
11461,1600787,5,EyadR,22/09/2021,"I can recommend the pitch. Were there at the end of September and was only half full. Very quiet at night, toilet and shower clean. All services included (except for power connection). The pool is definitely a highlight for this parking space, which guests can use for free. Valencia can be easily reached by metro in 35 minutes for 5 euros there and back."
11461,1596425,5,TobiasProebster,21/09/2021,"Super nice staff and great location to take the metro to Valencia. In the off-season almost all seats were free, so there was plenty of space. Clear recommendation :)"
11461,1579580,2,mariepierrel,15/09/2021,Very friendly welcome. Attention rather camping than area of motorhome !!!! in the elec part you may find yourself glued to each other and a lot of back and forth until late at night. maintenance of sanitary facilities with cold water for the dishes. correct pool. We met 3 other couples there and we were all of the same opinion. We will not be going back
11461,1576718,4,Sareta24,14/09/2021,We have spent one night and the truth is that the treatment we have received is 10
11461,1557412,5,noguerol13,07/09/2021,"Incredible place ... we spent 3 nights we could see the fallas, the treatment of the staff of 10 the girls at the reception and the one at the bar super friendly, they got us the subway tickets to go to Valencia there are routes to do by bike everything very well I recommend it plots with light and very cheap it has a pool and all the great services cleaning everything"
11461,1508258,5,Fco.Aparicio,24/08/2021,"A perfect area for its location and train stop. All services, ideal for visiting the city of Valencia. Quite a lot of shade, medium pitches with light ... there are also those without light. Pool to cool off. Some users are unaware of the start time of silence that begins at 23:00."
11461,1499529,2,juan0815,22/08/2021,"Cheap price and easy access to the city. However, there were a few showers that weren't really clean. You have to pay extra to fill up with water and there is a constant change of vehicles in the front area of the square, which really affects sleep. In addition, my friend's adilettes were stolen."
11461,1499179,4,Nelma,22/08/2021,"Very well-kept area, clean but with few shadows. Close to a metro station that takes you to the center of Valencia in 35m, very attentive and pleasant staff."
11461,1485632,3,BuenasPeluso,20/08/2021,Pool: quite cloudy the water and has some bugs and plastics. Location: more than 1 hour by metro to the City of Arts and Sciences and the metro runs every 40 minutes. 40 liters of drinking water cost € 0.50. Pitches with little shade and stone floor. Peaceful camping. Good value for money.
11461,1480053,3,Txangoneti,19/08/2021,"A pleasant campsite for € 14 on a small pitch and without electricity. Depending on the van, comment that some of the small ones have some slope. The deal is very good. There are works between two metro stops, which means that you have to take the bus and it takes a long time to get to Valencia (it took me 1h 30min each way), that is why I give it 3 stars right now"
11461,1478034,4,jenandpaul,18/08/2021,"A very simple site, all you need for a short or long stay. Bathroon facilities are tired but functional with ample hot water. The shop has most things to get you buy and the bar restaurant is very good. The staff/owners are 2nd to none, friendly and attentive, always with a smile."
11461,1456029,4,Tritxe,14/08/2021,"Area with pool and bar, nearby metro stops, the bad thing is that the metro is on a section with construction work and you have to change to a bus and it takes a little longer than usual, the rest is very comfortable to visit the city. The girl at the reception was a charm, she took me the tickets for the Oceanografic and also the subway card. You can camp, people have advances on."
11461,1455792,2,ViajarEnRuta,14/08/2021,"We paid for 3 nights with good expectations for the comments and the few alternatives to visit Valencia but I get almost nothing positive except the reception and the pool. Poor cleaning, for example the same papers and dirt in the showers at night as in the middle of the morning and scale inside the cups. Only 3 showers per bathroom for so many people. Archaic sinks and showers. I will not come back."
11461,1439086,5,jc33,11/08/2021,"Excellent stay in this area which also serves as a campsite. Very friendly welcome by a young girl who speaks French. Showers, toilets, swimming pool ... everything is nickel. Correct locations. Access to Valence by bus and metro or by road in 20 minutes."

11461,1358232,4,ferlojo,24/07/2021,"Good area to visit Valencia, since despite being far away if it is well connected, good service, quiet and clean place, what I did not like was the pool hours in the middle of summer (8:00 p.m.)"
11461,1358199,4,Isaclau,24/07/2021,"Area far from the city but possibility of taking the subway 5 minutes from the area, very good service, it is seen that it was a campsite and they have renovated it for motorhomes, swimming pool with closing time at 8:00 p.m., ideal for visiting Valencia, all services, bar and shop although the person in charge of both is not very pleasant."
11461,1349524,5,aixaboomer,22/07/2021,All great would return for sure. A super correct deal
11461,1342827,5,Manu88,20/07/2021,"Very organized, calm and good atmosphere. Super friendly and attentive workers. The paella from the bar of 10 !! The pool was great, although for me it closed too early in the heat. If I have missed some grass, and an area to exercise. In general to repeat."
11461,1339695,2,Mahissitan,19/07/2021,"We stayed here for 2 nights to visit Valencia. First of all: the idea of taking the metro into the city is good, but it rarely runs and after about 11 p.m. it doesn't run at all. We stayed here for a weekend so it was very busy and noisy. The sanitary facilities are pretty dirty and rotten."
11461,1336130,5,jonanna,18/07/2021,Great place for little money (€ 12). Sanitary facilities in order and with washing machines. There is a restaurant and pool.

11461,1323341,3,Ruud60,14/07/2021,"We have stayed for 2 nights, in the 3 days we stayed the bathrooms were not cleaned, lot of noise from people, because the parking lots are very narrow and next to each other, use of the metro to Valencia is highly recommended."

11461,1303277,4,TheAdVANturousThree,07/07/2021,"Very nice service, staff: inside speak very good English and are very helpful. Sanitary facilities clean and tidy, washing machine and dryer for a fee. Pool area also neat and clean. The parking spaces without a power connection are further away from the reception, unfortunately the WiFi reception is significantly weaker here."
11461,1300567,5,lilmonsta,06/07/2021,"Great place with a pool. With metro nearby to visit Valencia. Without light € 12 24h. Bathrooms, showers, sinks, pool, bar ... Perfect. The treatment of the staff very very good. You can buy tickets for oceanografic and science etc ... and even for the metro. The only one but is the rooster that crows from 5:30 in the morning"
11461,1300293,5,bier59,06/07/2021,"Perfect choice to visit Valencia. Great reception, you get a city map, maps for the metro which is only 5 minutes away and which takes you to the center in 25 minutes. A very nice bar and a very clean nice pool. Highly Recommended."
11461,1297190,4,rubiavaska,04/07/2021,"Excellent choice, € 12 without electricity and a fairly large plot with no one around and with electricity in the parking lot. Small but useful pool. Shop-Bar with the basics. A great find to spend a very hot day and night."
11461,1293597,5,Qnapper,03/07/2021,Well for the price (€12) a night with WiFi that really works well and hot water as in really hot what’s not to like. The staff are really helpful and kind. We do not use EHU so parked in the area for none EHU and it’s great with or without shade. They supply tram tickets into Valencia and paper guides etc etc. There is a cafe/bar/shop on site if you need it. We will come back.
11461,1288746,3,ilviha,01/07/2021,"The intention was to see the city of arts and sciences and we have done it but it is further away than we thought: take the subway, make a change and walk 2 and a half km until arriving, on a pleasant road, perfect bathrooms, willing and pleasant staff Very small plots, so much so that the table could miraculously fit mosquitoes. There is nothing around to walk around. The pool is fine but the water is a bit dirty."
11461,1281248,5,LeoErik,27/06/2021,"Excellent area for ACV, CV and shops. plots with and without elect. There is a wilderness area where it is like wild camping. We went with CV. The truth is a discovery, we will surely return. The only downside is that there is no water connection on the plots. Since when you go with a caravan, you have to load water with carafes or go to the loading and unloading area of the motorhomes."

The staff is very friendly and helpful, overall the campsite is well organized and you get (via QR codes) good instructions on how to get to Valencia by metro, an overview of the restaurant menu, etc. WiFi also on the pitch, pool, smaller Fitness park and really nicely done up! :)"
11461,1230314,4,Chan043,01/06/2021,"Good place to stay when visiting the city. Safe and secure. When you have bikes, take a bike rode to the city and return by metro with your bike. Takes 16 km to get there. Enjoy cycling Jardin del Turia.
Friendly staff and good atmosphere! 4 in stead of 5 stars because of the distance."
11461,1209004,4,LaLola_en_ruta,21/05/2021,Very friendly at reception. Add that the metro to Valencia only runs between one and three times an hour.

Ideal for visiting Valencia, (20min by metro from the center), with a stop 5min from the camper park, very friendly staff, they advise you recommend places, they sell you metro tickets and everything at a fair and reasonable price. More camper parks like this please .."
11461,1208772,4,shollak,21/05/2021,"Great place if you come to visit Valencia. Metro within walking distance. Make sure you don't miss the last metro on the way back. Also important to press the stop button: the metro only stops at this stop when you press the button (this almost went wrong with us :)) The places are not really inspiring with little shade and privacy, but we only came for the city is fine. Staff could speak English well and were friendly. Shower and toilet were clean"
11461,1204825,5,slv90,18/05/2021,"Love it!!! Good zone. Close to take the metro. The camper price is very good, if you stay 4 days give more discount. I love atmosphere. There bar price is very good. The super friendly waitress and reception there are two a woman on holidays and a man from work, they are nice and super nice. I RECOMMEND IT!!!"
11461,1204227,5,Frida19,17/05/2021,"Very nice place and the operators are super nice! We received a lot of helpful tips for Valencia. The metro to Valencia is a 5-minute walk away, tickets are also available at reception. We felt very comfortable, thank you very much!"
11461,1200183,5,TurboDs,15/05/2021,Stayed here in February. Good location for exploring the city. Price for a city parking space is reasonable. great supply and disposal. Sanitary outdated but clean.

He provided us with all information about Valencia and was very personable as well as the other staff. The sanitary facilities were clean. It was quiet at night. Something was going on during the day. 14 euros a night without electricity.
11461,1162414,2,schueri,01/04/2021,"The place is losing service. 15 euro for a measly parking space with 4 amp. Electricity ... the showers are neglected badly. The restaurant is closed on Tuesdays. It's a shame, but it's no longer worth the price."

11461,1148802,5,EnR,08/03/2021,A super stop to remember and come back to! Owners are very helpful and kind. We had very cosy spots with our friends. The restaurant serves good food. The showers are not the newest but the very hot stream of water without having to push anything totally made up for it. Laundry detergent that actually smells good! Metro around the corner for visiting Valencia. We would definitely come back here for a few days in the city!
11461,1134177,5,carlosll,31/01/2021,"Excellent place to stay indefinitely. We will go again. Perfect facilities. Welcoming and caring owners, that alone is worth going to."

11461,1098397,4,drlbradley,19/10/2020,"This is a very pleasant stop if you would like to visit Valencia. The metro station is very close. We didn’t want to use the metro and so we biked to Valencia. The staff are super friendly and really make you feel welcome. Nothing is too much trouble. Services are ok, showers so powerful that you get a free massage! It’s not somewhere that we would stop for longer than 2 nights but for visiting the city it’s perfect. Also, the barking dogs up the road need sorting out. Go and speak to your neighbours because they spoil an otherwise quiet stay."
11461,1095997,5,miguelmlajara,17/10/2020,"Very good area to visit Valencia. It has all the services, filling and emptying, electricity, sinks, showers, toilets, bar and pool. With a nearby metro stop that leaves you in the center of Valencia in 30 minutes. Garden area where you can also take tables and chairs. We were very comfortable for two days. Great attention from the reception where they provide you with tickets for the metro and give you information to visit the city. Clean showers with hot water. If you visit Valencia do not hesitate to stay here."
11461,1095163,4,gargoneta,16/10/2020,"The place is very nice, quiet, well priced, the toilets could be better so I don't give it 5 stars, close to the highway, full of services since it offers nearby metro lines to get to Valencia, a small bar , swimming pool, good water change services, you can even get drinking water for very little money. They close the barriers at 10pm and we did not know if we were going to arrive at that time and the receptionist told us that if we did not arrive she would fix it so that we did not sleep on the street, so we were very grateful for the attention of the camping staff"

Everything clean and well ordered, there is nothing in the surroundings but you can go to Bétera which is 3 km away and there is everything. EYE when you come back by metro from Valencia, there are two lines 1, one reaches the end (Bétera) but the other ends a few stops earlier and therefore does not reach the campsite."
11461,797507,5,family04,27/03/2020,"18-20 / 01/2020. Great place, warm welcome in several languages. Many services even in January, including sale of empty gas cylinder + Spanish regulator, which is a boon given the difficulty in obtaining gas when you do not have a Spanish cylinder. Clean and heated toilets. I recommend, especially when reading the comments on the other spots around Valencia."

11461,790185,4,mobilseinzu2,03/03/2020,Quiet place. Good starting point for visiting Valencia. This is also possible with a bit of skill with the bike. Restaurant not recommended.
11461,786688,4,Saruki3,25/02/2020,We were one night to empty and fill our car. The attention is great and the site has a children's park and a metro stop 400 meters away to visit Valencia (we buy tickets at the reception because the stop is a stop). Around there are only roads and little else. Clean bathrooms and hot showers without additional cost.
11461,785544,5,Sebastien0601,23/02/2020,Very pleasant welcome in French. Pitch with electricity. Paying clean water: 50ct for 40 liters. Washing machine and dryer on site. Restaurants offering good paela. Metro 400 meters. You can buy a card after the reception of the area. It takes 30 minutes to reach the center. I highly recommend to visit Valencia.
11461,784100,3,aneth01,21/02/2020,"Pleasant campsite in winter. Welcome in French. Quiet in the countryside but in 30 minutes with the metro, 5 minutes on foot, you are in the center of Valence. Correct space for a CC of 7m50. All the advertised services are present. Price 17 € / night with electricity 6 Amp. Showers / toilets a little outdated but clean. If full camping is not sufficient. A welcome drink is offered. We will come back ?"

11461,776337,3,jammumad,04/02/2020,Good for one night and visit Valencia.
11461,773631,2,noel84,28/01/2020,"Well, no, I won't be coming back. The welcome however was very warm and in French. The setting is far from magical but clean. The presence of the metro next to it allows you to get to Valence in 30 minutes. However, don't let yourself be trapped by the restaurant. Cold paella and barely cooked rice. Reception and service more than unpleasant. Bad image for Valence where paella is part of the heritage. So the area yes the restaurant no."
11461,772448,5,Domi38,25/01/2020,"Very good area, clean shower, unlimited hot water damage to water you need pieces of 50 Cts for 40 l I will come back and I recommend it"

Small nice camping restaurant that offers groceries, bread (don't be fat, there isn't something for everyone!), Tapas and homemade paella on Tuesdays and Fridays. Considering the price of the night (17 € with electricity), damage to pay 0.50 € / 40 l of water. Metro to Valence at 200m and tickets on sale at reception."
11461,767834,3,martou64,12/01/2020,Very good but the prices fluctuate a lot pitch without electricity 12 euros with 17 euros with trailer on double plot 27 euros on single plot 22 euros warm welcome

11461,763779,3,jlred1978,04/01/2020,"Friendly staff and always available. Poor bathrooms and showers and were not clean. In the area of non-electricity they do not allow you to book and you have to move to the shower or the bathroom, which in summer can be done but in winter with young children it is complicated. In addition our last night was moved as our plot partners were dedicated to making noise from 7 in the morning."
11461,758880,4,VanessaPatrick,29/12/2019,"Nice place for 1 night with electricity. You stand like in a sardine can in the (park) squares with 6 amps of electricity, the squares without electricity are very nice, green and spacious. Toilets clean on arrival, no more in the evening, there are only 3! Staff is super friendly, explains everything very well. Great connection to Valencia with drr metro for 1.50 pp In winter nothing for longer."
11461,758105,4,Pagal4711,28/12/2019,"Very friendly staff, everything u need is there, perfect to stop over n to visit Valencia, train station is very close by in walking distance n takes 25min to reach center.

11461,755102,3,Motorhome.life.l.l.c,19/12/2019,Stayed 2 nights. Great location. Hot showers. But both nights we woke up to the dogs next door barking.
11461,754270,4,Triumphfan,16/12/2019,Great site
11461,753595,4,mariemart,14/12/2019,"Complies with what is described. Roads all around but advantage of a top Mediterranean garden that we have dogs, just the right size"
11461,752673,4,Helton,11/12/2019,Good site with all facilities (water €.50 for 40l). Handy for the metro but access not at all pedestrian friendly and bordering on dangerous at night. Same applies if you try and walk to Betera itself (we gave up due to constant speeding traffic on small road with no pavement). Note after 5pm only one tram every hour from Valencia.
11461,751692,5,Lunila,08/12/2019,"Very well equipped with all services, clean bathrooms, showers with unlimited hot water, washing machines, sinks with hot water. Afternoon bar and pool in summer. Paid drinking water. The subway nearby but half an hour to downtown. Very kind."
11461,750994,4,Pecasmor,07/12/2019,"Great place, clean toilets with all the services, we called en route because we were late and they waited for us to arrive and on top of that they gave us some very good welcome drinks of Sangria, free of grays and blacks free and filled 50 cents 40 liters"
11461,749742,3,womimcwom,03/12/2019,"Good place for a visit to Valencia (about 25 minutes by metro), 17 €. There is everything you need, but not in the best condition. Sanitary in the years, pool also. Environment not nice, you feel no urge to go for a walk there. Reception very friendly, lots of good information, also about a very good homepage. Conclusion: good place for visiting Valencia, but not more."
11461,748258,5,TheUglyCamper,29/11/2019,Brilliant place to stay if visiting Valencia. Great value for money - especially as this place has a pool! The staff are really friendly and helpful and the showers are hot and not on a push button. The metro is only a short walk and the bar was great for when we got back in the evening. Would definitely go back.
11461,743530,4,theroverlanders,15/11/2019,"It is a good place to leave your motorhome safely whilst you explore Valencia. Short walk to metro (buy tickets at reception as there is no machine at the station), metro runs every 25 mins or so. Showers are hot, good bar area, little shop and restaurant. Have to pay 50cents for drinkable water (this allows you 40 litres)"
11461,741550,5,nbarr17,11/11/2019,If you go to Valencia you have to stay here! Best customer service I’ve experienced in Europe with excellent amenities. Don’t pass this up. It is extremely safe as well. Short walk to the metro takes you right into old town Valencia.
11461,741513,4,Ettore2019,11/11/2019,Campingcar with excellent value for money. Without electricity € 54 for 4 nights. Metro stop nearby. Silent area and I perceive security. Very friendly staff. By bike it takes 50 minutes to arrive in the historic center of Valencia.

11461,737337,3,Rcc,03/11/2019,"All as described, the perfect reception, as it is the lighting and access from the subway that there are no lights or sidewalk or shoulder, and the prices of the store / bar (a chupa chup € 1)"
11461,727511,5,Ricky63,22/10/2019,"Super nice pitch with all the trimmings. Conveniently near the highway. Mega nice lady at the reception. Rarely met someone who loves his job so much! Top place, highly recommended!"
11461,725072,5,bassmeulders,19/10/2019,"Definitely 5 starts. For only 12 euros you get a perfectly nice parking spot, many amenities like showers, water, breakfast, bar, swimming pool. We stayed 2 nights but could also have been 5 nights for us. Great price/quality value, definitely recommend if you stay nearby Valencia. It's a bit of a trip to Valencia, but so chill to stay at this place. Would go again!"
11461,724573,5,fran61,18/10/2019,"Great place, great hospitality, great service, 5 minutes from the metro that arrives downtown. I'm coming back to Valencia for sure, I'll be back here"
11461,711589,5,Brettandpaige,03/10/2019,We absolutely loved it here. The staff were very friendly and happy to help with anything you need. Sorted us with metro cards to get into the city (the station is a 5 min walk) and even planned a route for us to see as much of the city as we could in the one day we had here. Could not recommend enough. If I come back to València I will be staying here for sure!
11461,702337,4,poersch,23/09/2019,"Very big place, everything is there. 2.5 km from and to the highway. From the place very well organized to take the train to Valencia. 5 min walk then 25 min by train. Perfect."

11461,681326,5,boblepongette,08/09/2019,Home very smiling and professional (speaks French). 15 euros per night with all services including non-drinking water. For drinking water 0.50 cts 40 liters. The locations are right but enough to get out table and chairs. We did not like the bar except the waiter who is very friendly. Mainly frozen dishes prepared by a cook who blows annoyance.
11461,680343,3,campagnes,07/09/2019,"Aire very well, a lot of people, but beware the restaurant bar generates noise, discussions, the circulation of vehicles late at night"
11461,676912,4,svensvans,04/09/2019,"A very nice, rather modern pitch with pretty much all amenities. As a welcome there is a glass of sangria per person on the house and the tapas are also delicious! In the morning there is a baguette service from 8:30. The pool is large and pleasantly warm (26 degrees at our time). The staff are super friendly, helpful and speak many languages. Wifi works very well in the squares along the reception. Playground for children and fitness equipment park available. There are places with 4 or 6 ampers. The pitches directly at the front desk are rather narrow. But there are still further parking spaces directly behind the driveway, which offer more space. Metro is easy to reach and goes directly to the city center to Valencia (about 25min). Anytime again, but one point deduction for the rather narrow shelves."
11461,669785,5,masanjiro,31/08/2019,"Very well connected with the city, correct bathrooms, welcome sangria. Price of a motorhome and 6 adults € 16 without electricity."

Attention against the subway line that gives access to CamperPark the last is at 22h! !"
11461,612898,1,FrauMumu,09/08/2019,"Location is not really good. In the evening you can not go to Valencia by metro. we were forced to eat at the campsite. Paella Special, which was too expensive. 45 € for two people for a ""snack-restaurant-level"". Sanitary facilities dirty. Pool is also overrated."
11461,610654,4,berthoh,08/08/2019,Definitely comfortable. Too bad the metro does not serve until late
11461,603848,4,leclaret,06/08/2019,"Good clean and well maintained campervan, friendly staff nice pool, not very big place, sanitary niquel, the problem comes from people who respect nothing, disrespectful noisy and too many vehicles coming in and out until 22:30."

An employee who worked in the restaurant in the evening was so loud (talking and singing) that we had to ask you to be quieter, it was annoying. The toilets were not very inviting, it would have to be cleaned more often. The pool was nice. All in all, for one night for the price ok but you should not expect too much."

11461,498316,4,padraigl,31/05/2019,"Rang to see if they offer services only, which they do.
The service area is not so easy to manoeuvre into. I had to back in to empty and then drive in to fill the fresh water. Not great if there are people waiting. Its clean and well kept.

It's €3 to empty the black WC and grey waste, paid at reception. They take cash or card.
The grey drain is a normal ground drain. 
The black WC has a drain at ground level and another a meter high under a cover, just under the black WC tap. I found the black WC ground drain easier and with less splashing.
The fresh water tap at the opposite side has a coin meter. €0.50 for 40 litres and it only takes €0.50. 

Overall it a nice compact site. There seems to be an outside area, just in the first gate and a courtyard area in the second gate. There is also an area for what looks like long term storage. 
The pitches look small. The toilets were very clean. There was a swimming pool which is a bonus as there was not much shade. 
The receptionist was very friendly and spoke many languages."
11461,498085,5,Gluecksverbreiter,31/05/2019,"5 minutes walk to the metro, in 20 minutes in the center of Valencia (10th ticket costs 18 € to buy at the reception). Nice campsite, clean sanitary facilities, hot showers, playground and pool available. Super friendly reception, loved it. Completely satisfied, for 15 € the night the hammer. We felt very comfortable. For a scheduled two days stay was a week. Top!"
11461,489817,4,ninallnk,22/05/2019,Nice little family pitch to see Valencia. With the Metrokarte (18 €) you are in 20 minutes in the city. Sanitary facilities are okay and clean. Very small plots.
11461,480062,3,Leofreund,09/05/2019,Except for the economically dimensioned pitches (in addition to our normal wide Wohnmobik the camping table only fits lengthwise) everything is right here. And over € 15.00 for two people you can not complain verily. Conclusion: highly recommended for a visit to Valencia.
11461,477024,1,pallars,05/05/2019,"They sell that they have a pool, but closed in mid-April with plenty of heat. The best, to go by train to Valencia, otherwise very fair."

11461,442393,3,cp,20/03/2019,"In my opinion, it is an area and not a campsite. The places are narrow and sometimes badly placed. We do not let you choose your place so we can have surprises (against the local trash for example). Dear for the benefits. At this price with Acsi we have a real campsite in El saler. The positive It is the proximity of the metro to 300 m. If I come back to Valencia I get to camp. Given the reviews we were disappointed."

11461,440185,4,The.Wicksy.Wanderers,15/03/2019,A lovely campsite with all the necessary facilities. Excellent night's sleep. My only issue is that you have to pay to top up the  fresh water in your motorhome (50c for 40l but it cost us 2€ to fill up a 100l tank!?!). You shouldn't have to pay for water when you have already paid 18€ to camp there.
11461,439222,2,jenka,12/03/2019,"This can't be the same place as the reviews: it's an expensive aire, the facilities are desperate for an upgrade, the water was cold. A few positives: good location to get the metro in to Valencia and easy access from the A7. Sorry for the negative post."

11461,417709,2,havevanwilltravel,30/12/2018,"I’m a bit baffled by all the positive comments to be honest. You get what you pay for. The worst of parking-lot layouts, sometimes-hot shower, not enough powered sites, miles from town, on a half-hourly train for which you can’t buy tickets at the local stop so to be legal you have to 1) wait half an hour 2) go one stop and 3) get off to buy a ticket 4) wait another half an hour.  The manager and bar etc are all very friendly but doesn’t make up for the overall bad things of location  and averageness of facilities."

Proximity to the metro (stop) and possibility of acquiring a bonus of 10 trips at the reception.

11461,414359,2,rufach,15/12/2018,"Value for money is good. Complaint complaint. The negative part is that we have been 2 nights, and 2 there are people who think that you are alone in the middle of the forest, people without any respect for your right to be silent at 11:23 p.m. ... at 01h ... and in the morning at 06h ... at 07h ...

Great location and the staff were extremely friendly and gave us all the information we needed to visit the city, including a map highlighting where to go, and selling us the metro ticket which we sold back to them at the end of the day as there were unused journeys on it. The showers were excellent and the tapas  in the restaurant was first class. The only downside was that our pitch was a bit small, but would definitely call again."

Level site lit until late and locked during the night. Some road noise and dog barking from the surrounding area. Great access to Valencia on the tube 300mtrs away running approx every 30 min.
11461,118271,2,Joal29,13/01/2017,"Area too expensive €17 without filling water, you have to add €1.5. Located in a depressing area. Too bad because Valencia is very pretty. We personally didn't like it."

11461,99731,4,kaftaba,25/08/2016,"Top motorhome area, the staff is very pleasant, the proximity to the metro is a plus for visiting Valance. In the evening when they come home, the children can enjoy the swimming pool (8 p.m., I think) and for adults, the unmissable little restaurant which makes a simply breathtaking paella, the toilets are clean and the showers are very pleasant. Speed for wifi is ridiculous."

11461,84108,2,ruterocampero,22/07/2016,"After returning this year, unfortunately, I am very disappointed. This year they almost doubled the price per day and the one who runs the bar this year is a (clever) since he charged me €2.5 for a glass of white wine.....in great features good for one day......for more days I don't see it..........I have many doubts if I will return. all the best"
11461,82551,5,guizzo,17/07/2016,"Great place to stop to visit Valencia, metro station 5 minutes walk away. Great welcome, clean bathrooms and there is also a wonderful swimming pool to relax in. The small, almost family-run bar-restaurant is excellent... Very good paella... I recommend it. If I were to return to Valencia I would stop again. We stayed for three days at the end of June: 2 adults and two children under twelve at the daily rate of 27 euros."
11461,82377,3,pascal77,17/07/2016,"Location very good. Nice and clean swimming pool. Sanitary facilities and showers Ok. Very friendly welcome. Price €12 pitch, electricity €3 4 Amps or €5 6 Amps. For water filling paying €0.50 per 100 liters. To sleep, the dogs in the surrounding houses bark every night, bring ""earplugs"" without forgetting the mosquitoes for those who attract them. Other than that, superb! Not far from Valencia."
11461,81625,4,julieta5,14/07/2016,I advise! Very good park with just one small drawback - drinking water is not included in the price. Metro 500 m and ideal for visiting Valencia.
11461,80533,4,br61,09/07/2016,Same as the previous comment with a little extra the very friendly welcome with a little welcome aperitif all accompanied by an explanation in French on how to get to town with the little accent that goes well thank you.

11461,63226,4,Courgettelady,03/02/2016,This was brilliant for us. A bargain of €12 per night with no electricity (we have a new solar panel we wanted to put to the test). Facilities were great. Loads of hot water in the showers and an on site restaurant/bar. 5 minutes walk to the metro station and about a 30 minutes journey into the city. Ideal.
11461,61725,5,zelter,29/12/2015,"Excellent, nothing to say, just a little extra for the metro. Do not go towards the psychiatric hospital, you have to leave it on the right hand side and go straight down, pass next to the white house at the crossroads and on the left you can see the stop - Very welcome between the 2015 holidays -"
11461,61430,5,Galle88,26/12/2015,"Fantastic site, good facilities, very clean and with an unbeatable staff treatment. Highly recommended I would only put one hit and it is completely foreign to them. The valencia metro does not accept pets if they are not small and with transport. Our peludete weighs 21 kgs and always accompanies us. So we left because we could not use the subway to go to Valencia. When we have left to learn, in France we have been in museums with our hairy companion."
11461,60766,5,pistatxeta,07/12/2015,"Highly recommended to stop in Valencia and visit the city. 10' from the subway (incredible but it gets there), showers with hot water (no need to buy extra tokens), reception service, bar, a small store with the essentials, sinks with hot water (nice now in December) , draining water, washing machine service. 2 adults and 1 child for €15/night 4A."

From €6 to €12 + €3 for electricity, with swimming pool, restaurant and services (WiFi included). Metro to Valencia 350 m with tickets available at reception which would close at 10pm but with the intercom it is always open. Perfect for visiting Valencia or for staying more than a month like I'm doing."
11461,55921,5,routard06,24/09/2015,"Camping without any charm of course but everything is new, everything is clean. The staff is available and friendly. The pluses, the swimming pool and the kitchen which is a real treat and not expensive for French people and finally the plus plus the metro nearby. The cheapest 6 euros, the most 12 € without electricity. Metro tickets are sold at reception. This place starts to get known attention in season."
11461,49013,4,jcsandravictor,14/08/2015,Great place with a warm welcome. We only stayed there one day but it was super nice with good tapas at the little restaurant. The welcome swimming pool after the road. Don't hesitate to stop there.

11461,45520,3,romulus92,02/08/2015,"Reasonable campsite, (€16 for four, didn't check it's 8) arrival 10 p.m., it seems reception 24 hours a day. On the other hand, given the time, no power on the site, generator not tolerated by the neighborhood, otherwise we were able to take advantage of the shower at will, small pleasant swimming pool for two or three swims and children, not sure about cleanliness"
11461,44235,5,cocogagayoushka,26/07/2015,Area with swimming pool at a reasonable price. I recommend
11461,43601,4,benancia,23/07/2015,"Great welcome at this campsite, what a team. We are in a van in the low cost zone where for 6 euros per night we can enjoy all the services: unbeatable: extra swimming pool. The only downsides: the lack of shade and access to Valencia (a metro every half hour). To recommend."
11461,39855,4,JaviCobo,25/06/2015,"Excellent, comfortable pitches, clean toilets and under construction. Very enjoyed a swim after spending the day at the Valencia pool. The metro station is one stop. Places are available for €6 in the entrance area, we were downstairs near the pool and services: three people and electricity €17 per day. // Excellent, comfortable plazas, clean and functional services. Is a person to take a bath in the swimming pool after spending the day in Valencia. The metro station is one step away. There are plazas from 6 € in the entrance area, our prices are lower than the services and the swimming pool: very people and electricity 17 € per day."
11461,38803,4,MorGwen,10/06/2015,Perfect for visiting Valencia
11461,32882,2,JcQ35,04/04/2015,"The only interest is the proximity to Valencia with the metro 300 m away and the secure Excessive price, €17 (with 6 amp electricity). That is 1 € more than a “Luxury category” campsite with “camping check” or “Acsi” example: Marjal in Crevillent. Correct welcome and comfort."
11461,29323,3,282828,20/11/2014,"Well maintained but noisy, dogs barking even at night near the area."

11461,19408,5,robinsonpascal,23/07/2014,"We're there for now and it's perfect. All services for a motorhome and two adults, €15. Swimming pool at good temperature, small bar on site. The only thing missing is shade and a small store for everyday products like bread, milk etc.... but apart from that for visiting Valencia it's great (pascal: Belgium). Friendly staff and the lady at the bar speaks French. The metro is really close and drops you off near the center of Valencia. A must-see aquarium, superb as well as all the architecture of the place. Metro card and Valencia map available at reception."
11461,17821,5,Tenete,06/07/2014,"Fantastic place, without a doubt the best to visit Valencia. Close to the A7 highway, next to a metro stop, and in the countryside, but 25 minutes from the center, with the metro. Very nice and attentive staff, always available. Emptying and loading water, wi-fi included, swimming pool, bar, picnic area, petanque... It's like a campsite, but the price is cheap (€12 per night), from CamperPark. 100% recommended."
