104655,1172512,5,Kutter2,12/04/2021,Great spot for a mobile. Very quiet with a view of the valley.
104662,1148154,2,Gmc91,07/03/2021,"Closed with a chain, I will visit comares and go back down"
104662,421009,1,loulousurf,07/01/2019,Magnificent view but unfortunately closed by a chain and padlock (see photo on 07/01/2018).
104662,406086,4,barou,09/11/2018,Perfect for the night even if windy. Superb view on the valley with the sea in the distance in the background ...
104669,3215499,4,Attila077,25/08/2023,"Huge parking, free and silent at night but chaotic and dusty during the day, they are doing some building work. Literally 200 meters from the sea, Malvarosa beach, there are no services. Watch out for unauthorized parking!"
104669,2843022,3,gretawgn,11/06/2023,"A very broken driveway, we had to drive very very slowly onto the square. The place was otherwise relatively good, but a lot of broken cars on site, so we didn't stay overnight."
104669,2652270,1,AAAlexandra,09/04/2023,"Extremely noisy place. many drunk young people screaming at night with loud car stereo during early hours. Unreliable car guards. It was not a pleasant night. In the morning, other young people circulating among the cars, talking loudly, others shouting."
104669,2588644,1,gottago,23/02/2023,Not a good experience. beggars and scammers wanting tips to watch the parking lot. ine even knocking on our motorhome window at 21:30 at night. We tried all 3 places along this area thinking our experience was just isolated. It wasn't. everyone else with these comments are right. save yourself some disappointment.
104669,2571326,4,Ledodo,07/02/2023,"Parking not very glamorous, but free and opposite the post of the guardia civil. Bus 19 which is 100m away serves the city center for 1.50 €"
104669,2556343,1,Parknightcojo,20/01/2023,"Not to be recommended. As soon as we entered, a sinister man made signs for us to park, but given his behavior we told him that we had taken the wrong parking lot, he asked us for money, food, which we refused and left. There's mafia… he's gone back to other weird cars!"
104669,2488190,1,ArjenvandenEnd,09/11/2022,"no shower, no toilet. not even on the beach, (probably due to the time of year)"
104669,2421418,2,newsvenni,03/10/2022,"Unfortunately we didn't have a good experience here. The car park itself offers plenty of space and we found a good spot right away. However, when we wanted to get something out of the car after the beach, a strange man came towards us who asked for weed and offered us to look after the car. When we refused, he became very aggressive, so we went."
104669,2375561,1,elenandthevan,16/09/2022,It's not a good place. There are many thefts.
104669,2297783,3,zazin,25/08/2022,Very good for sleeping thank you
104669,2104652,1,Noeliacatalaa,22/07/2022,"dangerous, lots of people forcing and trying to steal cars or car interiors"
104669,2001742,1,sammyt8832,22/06/2022,"Do not recommend! Parked here for a few hours in the middle of the day and got our window smashed in, bags taken out of the van and ransacked and cash stolen, the university down the road would be a much safer location :)"
104669,2001149,1,luca1233901,22/06/2022,Do not park here!!!! We were here for a few hours midday and came back and we had been broken into. Even though there is a police station there they do not monitor the car park so just avoid it!!
104669,1950573,2,AndreFritz,05/06/2022,Were there 2 nights. Showering is possible on the beach / toilet only accessible when the beach bar is open. Dubious guys want money for the night very aggressively watch out!!! Once an attempt was made to break into our house at night. Not recommended in my opinion.
104669,1855969,4,NahikariPotxi,27/04/2022,"We slept in our minivan on 4/14/2022, we arrived at dusk and we paid € 1 for these ""gorrillas"", we went to dinner and went back to sleep. We had a lot of noise from the young people who made the bottle, a kind of brass band in the morning but normal for Holy Thursday. There is no service if the bars are close to the top, as beach services were closed in April. Recommended"
104669,1823805,2,twinssoud_art,15/04/2022,"good place near the beach and with shade but some holes although the bad thing is the ""gorrillas"" that ask you for money to take care of the van and take advantage of it. What I did is say yes, then when I come back and that's it, but it's not a place to sleep, we continue along the route."
104669,1789414,3,LandRoutes,20/03/2022,"Great parking surrounded with bus and tram stops. The EMT ""BONOcard"" can be bought from nearby tobacco shop, 10 zone A trips to city center for 8€   2€ for the card. Metro (Tram lines) 4 & 6, or bus lines 19, 93 within 100mt walk.

""Guardians"" ask for 10€ to park. DO NOT GIVE MORE THAN THE LOCALS, 1€. This is undeveloped public property. They are just beggars. A few coins then leave for the day."
104669,1783956,2,gartenfeeling,15/03/2022,"The ""gorilla"" got 2 €, basta! Good place for sightseeing. Unfortunately, dogs are not allowed on the bus or tram."
104669,1756645,1,dirkprd,15/02/2022,"Immediately upon arrival, a pushy and seedy figure comes and hangs around the camper. I didn't have a good feeling at all and after half an hour I drove on to the quieter neighborhood in Natzaret."
104669,1651384,1,Chris66440,18/10/2021,"to flee, they ask you for money 30 euros then 10 ... ect ... to ""watch"" your motorhome. beautiful image for a beautiful city, where the people are lovely."
104669,1646121,1,DennisClark,15/10/2021,"After we had spent an hour here and had chosen the parking lot as a place for further city activities, a dubious guy came up to us and wanted to sell us drugs first and then collect a ""tip"" for taking care of our car. Stay away from this place!"
104669,1541226,1,Tomad,02/09/2021,Eye dangerous site they steal you.
104669,1310467,2,jeromemarconnet,10/07/2021,"Large parking lot but particularly filthy, and hardly arrived, racked up by a suspicious individual promising to watch us ""all night"" ... in short, we did not stay."
104669,1201963,3,DanielMorales,16/05/2021,Quite large parking. 2 very quiet nights. Very close to the beach. There are gorillas that you give them 1 euro and you get out of trouble.
104669,1200618,1,Frida19,16/05/2021,"Wanted to use the square as a starting point for our city visit (only during the day, no overnight stay). At the entrance, a couple of dubious guys come and want to collect 20 euros, but ""they take care of the car"". Would have been willing to give a few euros, but then he got gruff and said we should pay immediately. No thanks. Scammers. Bad feeling, have left the place."
104669,1196825,4,Tschamilla,14/05/2021,"Large parking lot 2 minutes from the beach. 40 min to the Oceanografic on foot. Tram stop on site and showers and toilets on the beach (open at 10 a.m., shower not tested). A group of young guys stop you and charge you a few euros. In return, they ""keep an eye"" on the car. During the night a young couple checked individual cars to see if they were open. Ours wasn't touched."
104669,1185995,3,greatdreamlikebreak,05/05/2021,Great place. We stood there for a total of 6 nights. We felt totally safe next to the police station (Guardia Civil). 12 minutes by bike to the old town. 2 minutes walk to the beautiful sandy beach. Also suitable for very large mobile homes.
104669,1171782,5,olfkipet,10/04/2021,The police told us to go to a campsite but after a little discussion we spent 2 nights there in a quiet problem.
104669,1064265,3,pox1211,22/09/2020,"We have been 3 nights and without any problem, although the area looks quite ""bad"". We left a bucket of water outside (between the van and the wall, and they took it away) The last night the police came, very nice, and they told us that it was a bad area, that we were careful to leave the van since there were very given to appropriating what is foreign ""."
104669,948933,2,kathilein934,10/08/2020,"Perfect to see the city, as the tram leaves right next to it (45 minutes to the city center). You also go 2min. to the beach. However, the parking lot itself hardly offers any shade and is very littered. Therefore only recommended for visiting Valencia, but not for cozy camping."
104669,793697,4,vallaroundtheworld,10/03/2020,"Super parking with other motorhomes. We spent two nights there unfortunately we fell victim to the Fallas, the Valencia festival, where many young people partyed all night in the parking lot ... otherwise I recommend"
104669,792712,1,Elmarmota,08/03/2020,Really a weird nasty place. Groups everywhere are drinking at night and intrusive beggars and broken people during the day.
104669,786632,4,Vanvan33127,25/02/2020,"Just I would add, beach and tram 2 steps away?"
104669,778693,4,isaway,10/02/2020,"Very practical, close to the tram to go to the center, and to the beach to enjoy it, right under the nose of the Guardia civil. By cons avoid Saturday evening, it is extremely noisy, people come to party but otherwise top"
104669,768389,4,renstd,14/01/2020,"Super P for sightseeing. Traffic noise during the day, quiet at night until the first tram goes. The police station behind provides security. Beautiful beach in 3 minutes"
104669,761910,4,Marx4,01/01/2020,"Descampado next to the promenade of Malvarrosa beach. There are gorrillas (I disgust them) who live in old houses that face the land, but the place seems safe (there is also a police center). I gave the euro to the gorilla that approached me (although it goes against my religion) and everything went well. We leave the motorhome all day and then spend a quiet night."
104669,759714,4,bubus2,30/12/2019,"We went there on December 30, 2019, good parking, toilet and closed shower (can it be for winter?), Quiet night, no worries, I recommend"
104669,756263,4,baladeur74,23/12/2019,"Always the same, accessible and free, no service but all amenities at 100 m. Nearby shops, small inexpensive restaurants in the Cabanial district"
104669,747165,3,holaleslolo,25/11/2019,It is a little noisy but especially on the weekend there were plenty of young people who drank with music in the background
104669,746087,3,surfingal,23/11/2019,"Parked here for the day whilst we visited the city, a long walk in. Guardia Seville station behind you. Three other vans arrived for the day. Didn't  stop the night but saw no issues other than road noise."
104669,742917,5,katharinadorothea,14/11/2019,"Great for a day in Valencia. Did not stay overnight, but perfectly fine during the day. A man wanted to brief us (we ignored him), then he came to us and asked for money, gave him 1 euro. A police officer stood next to the parking lot and we asked him if it was safe here - he said yes and he would not mind if we were standing here."
104669,716583,1,kikou78,08/10/2019,"I arrived around 19:30 on the parking lot in front of the police offices. Seeing the comings and goings I went to see the policeman on duty asking him if there were no problems, and there I was surprised by his response ""there are people who may come to see you for the money ""5mn after I had the right to an altercation with an individual for 3 €."
104669,697593,4,Moerphi,20/09/2019,Very good places to spend a night and go to the beach. Showers and toilets available. Seems to be safe. Little bit dirty though.
104669,576161,4,valerie.65,26/07/2019,We have just returned from a great night on the beach and visit the city tram and bus next door we were alone and no problem
104669,525380,1,Jules13,23/06/2019,There are no showers and disgusting toilets. The parking lot is full of trash.  Big party all night in the parking lot with loud music. In the morning they left their trash every where and a dump truck was dumping some disgusting water all over. DO NOT CAMP HERE!
104669,518762,3,Sergi66,17/06/2019,"A relatively quiet and seamless place to spend the night, a bit of car traffic."
104669,425479,2,mytinyschool,29/01/2019,"Convenient parking to visit Valencia. But big problem with the aggressive gorillo because we did not want to pay. He threatened us and he annoyed several people during our visit. But the guardia is right in front of us and recommended we sit on the side of the car park because their camera allows them to take a look at the vehicles. Finally, we stayed for several days because we had to fly and had no problem?"
104669,425158,1,So-En-Vadrouille,27/01/2019,I went there but I left for another place. Not felt safe.
104669,424120,1,Papygeo,23/01/2019,"To flee one of the pseudo guards is aggressive, I gave the room for the day and the next morning he returned to the charge, he wanted the room to have supposedly watched the truck during the night, I I refused, he threatened to puncture the tires if he saw me at the Belgian motorhome next door who refused to give the room for the day, they drummed on his truck around one in the morning, there were children who were sleeping inside. This person would live right in front, a means like any other to make money."
104669,405338,3,baladeur74,06/11/2018,I came 3 years ago and the place is still there a Martinique improvised guardian you give what you want but it is not very official otherwise the place is quiet with traffic all around
104673,3236161,5,AnnaBel35,29/08/2023,"Great spot, very quiet, magnificent view, flat. No services."
104673,3235949,5,j0nasw,29/08/2023,Very nice place. There was a lot of space and the view is breathtaking. The toilets are also very good. The only point is that it can be very windy.
104673,3184571,5,jerome6769,20/08/2023,Thank you to the municipality for the welcome! More or less flat land. Quiet night despite the occupation of the premises. Magnificent view of the lighthouse and the ocean. If you take the road to the left out of the lighthouse and you walk along the ocean: santuario de nossa senhora (a little unusual monument) and further Profesco restaurant. Welcome and quality of fish and seafood guaranteed.
104673,3156348,5,alkebel,15/08/2023,"We slept next to the Lighthouse but on the ground, the site is spectacular."
104673,3151112,5,Annaroby2016,15/08/2023,"Top place to enjoy the sunset and have a peaceful night with the sound of the ocean in the background. Being the only road to the lighthouse, it is quite busy from early in the morning. Super recommended"
104673,3143213,5,gastonlecombi,14/08/2023,"Super quiet spot, little passage where you can spend the night serenely with other van lifers. Of course, no amenities, etc., but a breathtaking view, especially at sunset. Waking up to the sound of the waves. I recommend!!"
104673,3128176,5,santagrapa,12/08/2023,Quiet night. With bathrooms.
104673,3124723,5,LaRamonettadeBlan,11/08/2023,"The sunset is spectacular. You can spend the night without problem, there are bathrooms and a couple of stalls or kiosks. People arrive, take their photo on the cliff and leave. At night it is quiet with a few AC and campers."
104673,3119470,5,RaphetClea74,11/08/2023,"Great location, a bit crowded at the end of the day for the sunset. Peaceful night without any noise!"
104673,3103505,5,Leonie35410,08/08/2023,180 degree ocean view Quiet place to sleep Only negative point Lots of wind
104673,3097920,3,MatPoupart,07/08/2023,A little disappointed with this spot. Nice sunset but lots of people to spend all night (Sunday evening): noisy tourists and fishermen. Rather park at the entrance near the lighthouse or continue on the coastal path to find a quiet corner.
104673,3087530,4,Fovemove,06/08/2023,Nice spot at the bottom of the lighthouse. Very nice landscape!
104673,3080821,5,marionagispert,05/08/2023,Super quiet night. We were 4 AC spending the night. I recommend it.
104673,3071900,5,sergisampons,03/08/2023,"Super spot. 1 night there with the sky covered but a very calm night, with a little wind but fine. The best place to sleep in Peniche. Highly recommended."
104673,3058528,5,termikina,01/08/2023,"Excellent place, flat, very safe and with spectacular views, the best place in Peniche to spend the night and be able to explore the entire cliff."
104673,3018404,5,gafiloupio,25/07/2023,"5 stars for the site, too bad a little temporary but seen extra without services but that is not a problem because there is the Intermarché"
104673,3011704,5,parkoamelo,24/07/2023,Very good spot to watch the sunset and had a quiet night here. A lot of people passing by tho bc of the view. Also a lot more places than 4
104673,3006109,4,Rowercrow,23/07/2023,"Good place to spend a night, very well leveled. With constant passage of cars during the day and some at night"
104673,3004521,4,indina,22/07/2023,"We spent the night here, wonderful sunset. Good site. The baker comes by in the morning."
104673,2980261,5,gaelle027,17/07/2023,Very good for the night. Magnificent view of the sea and sunset.
104673,2933773,4,kike1815,07/07/2023,"We slept here on 07/04/2023. A very quiet night, zero noise. There are several places to get into the ground at the foot of the cliffs, but seeing this perfectly flat esplanade we decided to watch the sunset at the foot of the cliff and then park to sleep on this esplanade"
104673,2912516,4,Guyonaarts,01/07/2023,"nice place to enjoy the view. Not overnight, maybe."
104673,2904198,5,Jayne8130,29/06/2023,Quiet place with beautiful sunset over the Island. Gorgeous coastline but the town was a big disappointment so just enjoy a glass in your motorhome
104673,2878906,5,thakim,21/06/2023,"The sunset here was so amazing, bring a bottle of wine and enjoy! No bathrooms, they are under repair. Nice area for nature walks along the coast. Small trash cans available. There was a snack stand when we arrived but he left around 7pm I think. Definitely recommend"
104673,2876258,3,Pete4263,21/06/2023,"In itself a really cool parking lot for one night. However, the night was characterized by constant noise from cars and car doors. Lots of anglers have used this parking lot to get back to their cars, sometimes by 4 a.m. There was really no thought of sleep."
104673,2866302,5,takgoya,18/06/2023,"There are two areas to park and spend the night. One before the lighthouse (more sheltered) where 4 or 5 motorhomes can fit, or once the lighthouse has passed with more delimited parking lots. We slept before the lighthouse alone and without any problem, a quiet night, zero noise. Its coincides good weather, magnificent sunset."
104673,2838171,3,eastfrisian1,10/06/2023,"Basically nice, but the public toilets are locked. In addition, the road is very busy at night. Traffic until 3 a.m., and then again at 6 a.m. Not really a quiet night."
104673,2826977,5,angeliquemotter,06/06/2023,Nice and quiet place with beautiful view. Fine for half a day and night.
104673,2825383,5,paulenkarlijn,06/06/2023,"Beautiful spot to watch the sunset, very quiet at night. Stayed here for one night. Felt safe."
104673,2790294,5,orianexmd,27/05/2023,"Great spot to spend the night. During the day they are a lot of cars passing by, but at night it's very quiet. Beautiful spot to watch the sunset"
104673,2781832,4,patmar30,24/05/2023,Beautiful sunset and calm night in the small parking lot in front of the lighthouse. A few other motorhomes around. No service but nothing but the scenery.
104673,2779759,4,tiffanySB,23/05/2023,Nice and clean place to sleep Unfortunately no toilets open
104673,2777852,4,Jkbsc,23/05/2023,"Great place over the coast. Some traffic until about 10 a.m., then very quiet. The toilets were closed (May 23) which unfortunately leads to people in the immediate area disposing of themselves rather than finding an alternative a little further away."
104673,2736609,5,Romy1306,09/05/2023,"Great spot to spend the day and night 
Toilets opened 24 h
Super views to the islands 
Bins and recycling facilities"
104673,2716805,5,Anaettony,02/05/2023,Facing the ocean and the sunset. Great spot. Calme. Spacious.
104673,2711849,5,frank1974,01/05/2023,"great spot to spend the night and enjoy sunrise/sunset. from here, you can hike along the coast to the town and supertubos beach"
104673,2700685,4,savannahjjames,27/04/2023,We had a great night here last night. There were 3 other campers parked up too. Felt safe. There were public toilets. Was windy but we didn’t mind. Had no problems at all. Lovely view too.
104673,2693421,4,Philip02,24/04/2023,Wonderful view especially sunset. Peaceful night.
104673,2683116,5,przezyciepl,20/04/2023,"Everything ok, quiet and peaceful"
104673,2670026,4,ThomasB86,14/04/2023,great vantage point for the sunset but very windy! toilets clean and open 24/24 just young people on motorcycles who came around 3 4 times and then left
104673,2634471,5,sunlightdelight,01/04/2023,Great spot but watch out on a stormy day. Sort of leveled. Scetchy public toilet. Stunning views
104673,2629502,4,Furgoneto,29/03/2023,"Esplanades before or after the lighthouse, depending on the wind (it can be strong). Area behind the lighthouse there are toilets open during the day and garbage containers. Great views (Berlangas Islands) and walks along cliffs, sunset. Let's take care to be well received."
104673,2624657,3,Chcol89,26/03/2023,"We went behind the lighthouse and had a very good night, there were 6 of us, no ban reported. Toilets available, low 4G, trash cans. And people all day. A good GR to do all along the cliffs."
104673,2609310,4,ISALU7,14/03/2023,A great and peaceful night. Advised
104673,2603684,4,lagertha89,09/03/2023,"You can park at the lighthouse or drive a bit further to the Miradouro (not for “heavy” vehicles). Busy during the day, but only campers for the night (5-6 vehicles in total). Strong streetlights are on from 7pm. Police car drove around in the morning, without stopping. Toilets are clean, with paper and soap. Beautiful rocks and waves. It’s windy!"
104673,2583574,5,theauroravan,19/02/2023,Good spot to spend a night. Restrooms are clean. After sunset almost no cars. The lighthouse has a red light and isn’t  bright at all.
104673,2574327,3,up4new,11/02/2023,"Flat and quiet parking space apart from the wind and the waves. However, not entirely legal. I think the parking lot is in the Nature 2000 area where staying overnight is forbidden, even though you can park here during the day. Therefore only 3 instead of 5 stars"
104673,2555677,4,DiDU26,19/01/2023,"Good spot in the wind, west of the wastewater treatment plant which is a hundred meters away and which smells of the entire south coast thanks to the strong winds... Very good internet coverage for teleworking..."
104673,2542884,3,egoman,05/01/2023,"In January I was alone here, only young people with rattling machines came and drove up and down. Didn't feel safe."
104673,2528691,5,Vanderfolk,26/12/2022,"Lots of traffic during the day but absolutely quiet at night. You only hear the waves beating against the rocks. Toilets were open, even with soap and paper. Stood here with four other campers."
104673,2503905,5,justineetsam,23/11/2022,A lot of space and just at the foot of the lighthouse it's great

104673,2370948,3,Ingemalaga,14/09/2022,"Good place to stop to see the cliffs and eat. But it doesn't seem recommended for sleeping because it's not level, there are odors from a nearby sewage treatment plant and there are a couple of trucks with people living there. Just to stop and take a walk."
104673,2370159,5,domnath,14/09/2022,We parked just a little further towards the sea Ideal for one night
104673,2364886,1,Rahel5657,12/09/2022,"As a day parking ok. At night we were attacked by mosquitoes (killed 50-100 mosquitoes in the campervan and were still totally bitten!) and finally permanent car traffic until 6 am. In the morning when there was a breeze there was a smell of faeces, I suspect from the neighboring sewage treatment plant. NEVER AGAIN!"

104673,2354198,4,LesBiscaLove,09/09/2022,Place with beautiful view and flat. A bit of passage until late evening but relatively calm. On the other hand we had an invasion of mosquitoes which did not give us a good night's sleep.
104673,2332758,4,LisaCl,02/09/2022,"Very nice place next to the lighthouse and with a view of the island and a beautiful rock formation.

Very nice view facing the sunset. A bit noisy in the evening as there were several people staying for the evening. Perfect for a one night stopover."

104673,1979201,3,Ligama,15/06/2022,"The sunset is magnificent but to sleep there is not the best. Mosquitoes have entered my truck by the dozen, people have arrived all night, the restaurant bar is closed because it is collapsing and the toilets are also closed. There is no shortage of parking spaces around this city, it remains a magical city but far from being maintained, it's a shame."

104673,1486151,4,davins4night,20/08/2021,We were a bit scared by the new law but we arrived and saw more motorhomes staying overnight and we were calmer. The only bad thing that there was a lot of car traffic otherwise everything great.

There are bathrooms, a little neglected but clean. I don't give it 5 because it is a very visited place and we woke up surrounded by people who observed us while we had breakfast ☺️"
104673,996968,4,Rufaca,23/08/2020,"Great views to watch the sunset and sunrise. Too bad about the north wind, from which the lighthouse could not protect us, we woke up a couple of times. Floor without inclination, perfect."

We saw them from above and from other comments it is seen that they leave a key for it, but we did not want to argue."
104679,2302216,4,Apnea12,25/08/2022,Great view. very quiet for sleeping. Convenient for walking along the coast.

 scratches were worth it. Also a friendly parks person came by and all he did was say Hi. We werent camped out and we had the dogs on leads, maybe that helped?"
104712,407312,4,Troopydelic,14/11/2018,"Arrived at sunset from the north, it's a nice costal dirt road in the natural park of the peninsula. You need proper tires, a narrow vehicle and probably 4x4. I don't think it's authorized to camp here, maybe it's ok during off season. I just spent one night on my way south anyway."

There are no signs that say it ia forbidden to park over night. Due to the cliffs on both sides not too windy. There is a beach restaurant with showers and toilets that were opened up around 9:00."

We arrived at night and you couldn't see anything, but they have fenced off the site and we couldn't find a way to access the table area with the van, you could only walk. Maybe if you leave when there is natural light you will see some way to enter."
104744,651462,4,30051962,22/08/2019,"Great .... to park a lot of places, they have mesh .. ,,, I think following flights (granite benches) they must be sturdy to bite them.

A shopkeeper nearby advised us against it, as cars and campers with foreign license plates are regularly broken into at night. We drove 5 minutes to Belem because the parking lot there is safe and free. There we could easily park our car for 5 days."
104937,2299493,1,LasVanistas,25/08/2022,"NOT RECOMMENDED ! Located between the port, a highway, the airport and rails, it is extremely noisy. The icing on the cake is a nearby nightclub with a broom of cars and loud revelers all night long (until 6:30). We hear the bad music from the box. When we wake up, a guy prowls around with a knife, staring at us insistently. Run away !!"
104937,2252338,2,TinTeuf,16/08/2022,"parking very close to the center and public transport, but beware of theft the motorhome next door was robbed in the evening when there was a dog in front !!!"
104937,2244721,1,darkmatter27,15/08/2022,"Convenient and level parking near the center. m unfortunately it is isolated and as you can see from the photo after 4/5 hours in broad daylight we found it open and what was there was stolen. in short, it is not recommended to leave the camper unattended."
104937,2148793,4,lawido,31/07/2022,"Perfect parking lot to go partying in Lisbon, the Schicki micki club next door is loud, but you don't have to worry about being broken into by all the snots, there are so many Porsches around with more in them than in the camper :) Had a quiet one night, very convenient"
104937,2144593,2,marieparrocel,30/07/2022,"we parked for the day and spent the night. there were other vans, we had a good night. noisy place, there is a nightclub not far away. but central to visit."
104937,2118852,4,cleachpn,24/07/2022,"We parked in a parking lot shortly before this one which is not listed. But which is relatively the same, except that ours was not yet full around 10:30. Lots of places, we paid 6€ a day. Right on the edge of a busy road and a coveted cycle path. Very good for visiting Lisbon, 15 min walk from Commerce Square."
104937,1786605,4,Lappage,18/03/2022,"Stayed here for 2 nights, it costs €3 per day (9:00am - 7:00pm) and then free overnight. Good place to stay, you can use the nearby electric scooters to get into Lisbon centre in 5 minutes. Good place to park to explore the city. Can be noisy due to local night clubs but it didn't bother me. There were 3 or 4 other vans here when I stayed. No services nearby"
104937,733890,2,mattdbk,30/10/2019,I arrive also in 13T unfortunately the parking is paying and for the moment I am parked on the zebra for want of more space
104937,444790,3,RomalaBarbara,26/03/2019,"The place during the week is actually pretty good. A bit noisy during the weekend but nothing too crazy. In any case, I suggest you be careful during the day, as they broke in today breaking a glass, this was during the day, with lots of people passing by constantly. So even if it feels safe it’s better to be careful."
104937,420544,4,dobigeon,05/01/2019,Really practical
104950,3009873,1,Alozanom,23/07/2023,"I have deviated from the route, expressly, to see the town and spend the night there. ALL the motorhome spaces were occupied by vehicles that were in the pool and/or in the Paddel Club. So I had to go. Very poorly managed."
104950,3000196,5,pirupunk,22/07/2023,"A perfect place to take a swim and cool off, there is also good shade and a pool bar right next door... And to top it all off, a walk through the town can be a great explosion of art..."

104950,2868823,2,adrian1981,18/06/2023,"We arrived on a Sunday and we see that a fountain and drain for buses without service. We ask at the bar about the bathroom and the showers and they tell us that not until 7 pm and that the showers ""maybe, it's just that today is complicated, I'll explain later"". Faced with so much mystery, we went to Camarasa."
104950,2843197,4,Albert-PM,11/06/2023,"Good place in the center, next to the pool and bar. The artistic murals in the village are worth visiting. There is no water yet... I guess because of the drought, it would be nice to put it at a modest price and avoid misuse."
104950,2825752,4,Bea17,06/06/2023,"The village is definitely worth a visit on its own, art on every wall and facade Beautiful! Services were out of order. We didn't spend the night there."

104950,2763818,2,mapa,19/05/2023,In accordance with the previous comment next to a school it's a shame that there are no services
104950,2718120,4,MontseRuben,02/05/2023,"We spent a very quiet night. The problem is that the water filling is out of service, we suppose as a result of the restrictions due to the drought. It would be nice to have an option with a symbolic price to prevent misuse of water, but not to cut it because a few liters of water are essential to make life in the motorhome. The town is worth it!"

Despite being a dead-end street, there is a lot of movement of people who go to play Padel, football... there is a bar right next door and clean water service that works perfectly. The village has left us speechless and it will surely become an annual stop to enjoy the new paintings! You must visit Penelles!"

104950,2582897,3,ivanroga,19/02/2023,"The place is good, if the people who make a bottle in the park next door let you sleep. If you are lucky that they do not have a bottle night, you sleep great, enabled to change gray and black water, and refill water."
104950,2563204,5,ulinawer,29/01/2023,"Very quiet area with space for 4 AC. It has to fill and empty water. Right next door there is a children's park, picnic area, barbecues, a bar and the municipal summer pool. 100% recommended"

104950,2475381,5,silvia71cat,31/10/2022,"We had a very quiet night. there was a motorhome meeting but they were placed apart so as not to occupy any space in the area.

However, we found sleep difficult with teenagers hanging out in the carpark metres from the car, playing loud music.

The good: in the middle of August it gives the shade in the morning in the level parking area. The bad: the train tracks pass right across the road. Oh, I don't know if it will be usual, but the people who are at Pic-Nic are too heavy to see without going away as soon as they see you pick up. In the whole morning they asked me about three times."
105080,612589,2,JB3C,09/08/2019,Indeed beautiful place but the camper parking has become forbidden.
105080,577184,1,fredelap,26/07/2019,Prohibition on camping car
105080,539569,3,simanyu,05/07/2019,"If you get good site you have the van quite level and with shade until 15. At night bottle and some train, difficult to sleep of the pull."
105080,530926,4,BopBop,27/06/2019,"Nice corner with a beautiful view of the sea. Indeed, the trains all night it can I really think to prevent sleep."
105080,487614,1,missalhera,19/05/2019,"Horrible! a group of young people came to squat the parking lot until 3am by grinding with megaphones. The other 2 van that were with me left in the early evening and I should have done the same. Worse, the next day they left all their rubbish and a Spanish came 'to heckle me' because the people who are traveling do that, 'for him, impossible that a Spaniard did, well let's see, a shame because the Creek is very pretty otherwise."
105080,427099,2,greglolo,06/02/2019,Nice day but a full night before the trains and car that passes all the time
105102,3216824,5,fabienfer,25/08/2023,sublime no noise and no one on the horizon possibility of swimming below and exceptional fishing
105102,2619859,5,Mellllllllii,22/03/2023,Top ! Just super nice place and tranquility
105102,2266179,5,charlyp.,19/08/2022,ideal spot! perfect for family breathtaking view. the colors at sunset are just as magical as in the morning when you wake up. tranquility and simplicity. it was perfect !
105102,2258144,5,benyto34720,17/08/2022,"Great spot! I recommend for the calm and the beauty of the place (several corners to land, easy to access) Follow airport (coming from teruel) by the road and a few hundred meters on the left, take the path straight until the stone house and always straight ahead. Possibility to swim and fish!"
105102,1879881,4,enricYmaria,09/05/2022,"Spectacular site, with NOTHING but tranquility (for better and for worse) without a doubt, a place that I will repeat, except in Summer due to the lack of shade"
105102,1691621,5,KatrienMichielsen,17/11/2021,"Not easy to find, but worth the struggle. Not sure if my care enjoyed the road.. a lot of loose rocks. Great spot for the night, swim, the silence !!"
105102,1414706,5,Toy24NL,06/08/2021,Incredible!!! We were alone on this spot; swimming in the pond. Breathtaking sunset
105102,1322460,5,amandinebdavis,14/07/2021,"An extraordinary view and very quick access to the lake. Indeed not easy to find, you have to take one of the paths perpendicular to the airport and not follow the GPS which takes you to the other side of the lake."
105102,1225675,5,jayscamper,30/05/2021,Amazing place!!!
105102,1208747,5,shollak,21/05/2021,"What a wonderful peaceful place. We were with a camper van and went off-road well, a bit bumpy but not a difficult road. Good flat spot with some shade. You walk down the hill for a dip in clear blue water."
105102,1196388,5,greg9114,14/05/2021,Superb very quiet place away from it all. We spent the night and no passage. We will return.
105102,1172513,5,Bremach,12/04/2021,Fantastically beautiful. Everything fits.
105102,855528,5,Marco3008,08/07/2020,Really very nice and calm
105102,659754,5,charlotteaurore,25/08/2019,"Beautiful spot very calm, we were alone. swimming possible. some fishermen next door but not disturbing. watch out for the gps location that does not indicate the right side of the lake, take a left when you arrive in front of ""the church"" (the GPS shows on the right)"
105103,1778392,1,silvaresende,09/03/2022,very uneven
105103,1684784,2,SamLoveSteph,11/11/2021,"If you want to spend a night alone in front of a splendid view, stop by! But take into account the traffic, the barking of the dogs, the church which rings every night and not once but twice and every half hour and the crowing of the roosters. To this add a significant slope! Water available But what wouldn't we do to enjoy the sun rising over the Douro?"
105107,1563755,1,Reixel,10/09/2021,"The road is not in disuse, it is a widely used National ..."
105107,1372528,1,bicicletera,27/07/2021,No charm and next to a road. Much better the hermitage;)
105150,389544,5,GiandJo,07/10/2018,Super quiet for the night.
105155,2006678,2,ManuelaundRudolf,24/06/2022,"Very few pitches for RVs. Very uneven terrain, difficult even with enough wedges. Otherwise occupied by permanent campers. Overall makes a very unkempt impression. Not recommended for one night just ok car wash was clean and in good condition."
105155,1890172,1,JEAC,14/05/2022,"The image when you arrive is exceptional. Once inside, it is a slum area. Plots none flat. All full of garbage, bones and cigarette butts. It is full of shacks throughout the year, in low season they are only open on weekends. Better to sleep at gas station. Very unfriendly."
105155,1468503,4,Ginesvw,16/08/2021,"Unbeatable treatment at reception, somewhat irregular pitches, quite shady, little updated bathrooms, for space, but clean. Entreteinment activities. Highly recommended."
105155,1363800,4,familyinroad,25/07/2021,We stayed the afternoon of Saturday and Sunday until 18 and we paid 29.10 for two adults and two children with a motorhome. The plots are very irregular and you almost have to open the gaps. To spend a quiet weekend is not bad.
105155,533907,3,marhil,30/06/2019,"The camping the pool and the bar very nice, but it is not very comfortable for the motorhomes. The plots are not very level and it is difficult to move along the roads through the low branch."
105157,873206,3,Xacg,16/07/2020,"Although the parking lot says that it is exclusive, clients spent the night accompanied by many trucks that did not go to the restaurant"
105172,2440401,3,laspescadillasviajeras,13/10/2022,"Stop en route, the site is not bad, the highway is close but nothing is heard. From the same car park there is a section of the green. The house next door has a black dog on the loose and he's been up most of the night barking around the van and from his kennel."
105172,1836231,3,Macsea,18/04/2022,Good place to do a part of the Greenway. quiet night You can barely hear the highway. There are some picnic tables.
105172,878393,4,marevuelto,18/07/2020,"Good place near the highway but quiet, without people, there are three tables with benches, there is no fountain."
105172,418431,4,tonil,31/12/2018,Perfect for the section of tunnels and mills of the vv
105178,3159472,5,raquelrrss,16/08/2023,A quiet and easily accessible car park. Near the village

105178,2017419,4,voyvoyvoy,28/06/2022,Quiet place with a beautiful view. We parked at the end of the street so there is no traffic. There were a few other vans so feels safe. Not completely flat but good enough :)
105178,1694163,5,ktuluu7,20/11/2021,"Very quiet and free, with a chemical toilet next door on the same street. Not all the street is level, but space is easily found. 10 minutes walk from the town center."
105178,449047,5,Bonnie70,04/04/2019,Be sure to park here and not anywhere in Valldemossa where there are blue lines. Those lines mean you must get a ticket and pay or you will get a 40 euro parking ticket. Sadly that happened to us!
105178,389748,4,Iloveknots,08/10/2018,It also has public toilets and a supermarket.
105189,3107365,3,traven.pl,09/08/2023,not stay at night only park for walk. Diety place and saw a Police a few times
105189,3077419,4,LucieGMCC,04/08/2023,Very nice view of the ocean perfect for one night but indeed very dirty pity. And a lot of car comings and goings despite the dead end
105189,3019099,3,ChristineCaza,25/07/2023,Nice spot for a picnic facing the ocean. A little windy but quiet because on a dead end. Beautiful panorama. Some rubbish that removes the 4th star

105189,2202633,2,jul64990,09/08/2022,Very easy access on track. The place is dirty... What a pity it spoils the fun. We spent a quiet afternoon and night there. The beach is accessible by very pretty little paths at low tide and we were the only ones there! No amenities for motorhomes.
105189,2030604,4,BobLeeSwagg01,02/07/2022,Perfect for the early afternoon. Sea view and sound of the waves.
105189,2010866,4,latribudu31,26/06/2022,"a very beautiful place we spent 1 night, a lot of passages in the morning and a lot of walkers and runners. a gentleman kindly came to tell us that we were not welcome"
105189,1823176,5,cofranmain,15/04/2022,"Beautiful place to spend the night. Some traffic early in the morning from people going shellfishing when the tide goes out, but no problem with them. The police came by first thing in the morning and they didn't tell us anything."

105189,1559678,3,pit0888,08/09/2021,Very beautiful view. The place is not very clean and on the side of the road even if it is not very busy.
105189,1273612,3,epsab,24/06/2021,"We spent a very quiet night there until the arrival, in the morning, of the cars of the fishermen on foot A police car came and went, did not stop Very good spot for one night"
105189,1092095,3,karmannbrothers,13/10/2020,"The place is absolutely fine, at low tide you can climb down the cliff and walk between the rocks. Beautiful sunset and calm night :)"

105189,744144,5,suissemoi,17/11/2019,"Maxxx, even a street lamp that does not work. great sea view"
105189,733080,1,bikesonworldtour,29/10/2019,"Sometimes I wonder who sets such ugly places here. Perhaps suitable as a last resort in the summer, but unacceptable in the off-season."

105189,645334,3,InaIndriya64,20/08/2019,Quiet place well eccentric but very dirty! No convenience
105189,642466,4,Traficnous,19/08/2019,"Beautiful place overlooking the ocean with the rocking waves to sleep, it's perfect. Only downside: there is passage during the day and a lot of waste on the side of the road but for one or nights, it's ok."

105189,411870,5,Cacelma,04/12/2018,"Spot very nice and flat, no service. Some (discreet) surfers prepare themselves in this impasse before going to the water. Quiet night cradled by the sound of (strong!) Waves. I recommend this place!"
105198,2140178,4,pascalgorin,29/07/2022,"Quiet and shaded car park next to a sanctuary, 14km from Aveiro. No noise at night but we were woken up in the morning by the bells and a few vehicles passing by."
