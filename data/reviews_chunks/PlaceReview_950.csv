22756,218374,3,pechugaspot,10/01/2018,Quiet
22756,63000,1,voyageur18,28/01/2016,I spent the night in the parking lot of the cemetery in front of the zoo. The police pass without turning around. No service and it's just good for a night of passage
22763,2846341,1,pelego,12/06/2023,"It's not comfortable, we didn't even stay, we left because we were against a wall, we showered and left by the way, when we entered there were 3 of us and a puppy. Don't ask us mouse how many we were and when we left they charged us for the puppy and one more. Awful"
22763,2557447,4,begur,22/01/2023,"We're ""not meat, not fish"" on this place! 28 € in December, a van, 2 people without electricity without internet Sanitary rooms outdated but clean Hot water without limit Almost directly on the beach 99.99% long-term campers Train station within walking distance Trains didn't bother us any more than other campers Can you do it for one night if you absolutely want to go to this area"
22763,2316846,5,adriuss,29/08/2022,"We have slept great! the atmosphere totally of Spanish people, 50 meters from the beach and the correct facilities !!"
22763,2226144,1,anaisarandia,12/08/2022,I would even give zero stars. It is that horrible. HORROR!!! Don’t go there. It’s millions of kids screaming everywhere all day and all night. We drove our van to the parking just because it was IMPOSSIBLE to sleep. So we payed 43 euro for 1 night and didn’t even sleep there. What a nightmare.
22763,2202010,3,KriyaVan,09/08/2022,"Nice reception, nice campsite (by the sea, with direct access to the beach). The gate closes at 01:00 AM, approximately 45 minutes from Barcelona. 90% are Spanish long-term campers with their children, quasi ""locals"", therefore louder, but very friendly. 100€ for 2 nights (2 people + van + tent)"
22763,2123797,1,Kunath1996,25/07/2022,"So for 43 € one night with the mobile home is a disaster, there is a nice reception and a good briefing, but since 99% only Spanish long-term campers live here with small children, there is no peace even shortly before midnight (children scream consistently rumm) really a pity that no consideration is taken here"
22763,1055851,1,vikynga,18/09/2020,"Fatal! There are only 4 small pitches for motorhomes, the pigeons perch right on top and leave you the beautiful motorhome ... it is expensive for what it is, old and on top of that you cannot discharge the gray water of which we were warned just as we were leaving, after having told us that it could. Very unhappy with this site"
22763,812458,1,jordi_284,30/05/2020,"Bungalows camping all year round, with the national road on one side and the train on the other. Everything and that I slept well and I have even been able to take a nap. The profile of people residing in the campsite leaves much to be desired. For motorhomes and caravans there are only 4 unique pitches, the rest are owner's bungalows."
22763,566265,1,paphio222,21/07/2019,"46 € for a van, an adult, 2 children and electricity. Rates of the coast either but the state of the campsite and the services could at least stick."
22763,401048,5,ouradvantour,29/10/2018,Beautiful large sandy parking lot right on the sea. End of October: Public toilets at a nearby bar Tottanua - a visit to the bar is worth it! Beach showers and taps are available. The train goes right behind the parking lot and is a bit loud - otherwise everything was great!
22763,292688,5,gtouille,18/07/2018,"Camping at the foot of the beaches, very family atmosphere, small pitches with vis-à-vis but all shaded. 1 van without electricity with 1 adult and 1 child for 26 euros at the end of July. After the hustle and bustle of Barcelona, ​​this is what you need for 1 night"
22763,285288,3,VANgabond,10/07/2018,"I pay 39 EUR for one night, two pers."
22763,51102,3,catchaie,21/08/2015,Very good for one night or more with direct access to the beach with a key at the reception a bit expensive but the rates of the coast! No service for motorhomes.
22787,2520713,1,josee02,13/12/2022,a little word under the wiper in the morning .... vc is a hospital center car park and not a motorhome
22787,1696460,3,annaizqui,23/11/2021,"It should be borne in mind that it is an esplanade that in the evening there is no one but in the morning it is a parking lot and it fills with cars and people. Very quiet until 6:30 in the morning, then there is a lot of noise with cars and people."
22787,1686673,4,Benetille2012,12/11/2021,"Very good spot compared to the motorhome area in the city center. In the end we took advantage of the area to empty the black and gray water as well as fill the drinking water but once back in the cc to spend the night there, the explosions of firecrackers and the ill-famed atmosphere convinced us to come to this car park right next to the hospital, much quieter!"
22787,1130283,3,lakorne,13/01/2021,"Large car park next to the hospital, fairly quiet, slightly sloping .. access pl nikel, close to all shops, possibility of walking there. next to the path to walk the dogs without passage."
22787,868023,2,Deivy81,14/07/2020,"It is an esplanade without more. You can spend the night, it is a quiet place next to the hospital, it is for a stop on the way and continue."
22787,750009,4,nonacharlotte,04/12/2019,"At the edge of the road near the hospital. good for big carriers or with trailers too. Good for a short overnight stop to visit the city, 1km600 from the center."
22787,745221,4,philnath04,20/11/2019,"We spent 2 nights here, quiet. Close to shops. In the morning on weekdays, many cars park for hospital visits but the car park is very big (the one in the ground) and that is not a problem."
22787,736218,3,losdegargallo,02/11/2019,"We spent a night here very quiet and safe, in the morning we moved to the area to visit the city, highly recommended if you go with children the visit with tourist train"
22787,231849,1,agueda,01/04/2018,"It is the hospital parking lot, we have stayed overnight and in the morning hospital staff has passed by and indicated that we could not be there."
22787,224405,3,rvanvugt,24/02/2018,A big parking suitable for a night. Noisy due to mainroad within 100m but acceptable. Also an acceptable walk into town. Okay so far.
22787,224007,4,phillyc,22/02/2018,Stayed for one night and left early the next morning. It’s quiet during the night but busy in the morning. It’s a hospital over flowing parking lot. Very close to supermarkets and shops.
22787,213418,5,nowhitebits,03/12/2017,"... We stayed at this location while visiting the village attractions and then overnight. It is a convenient stopping place for large vehicles just off the A92 Autovía, however, unaffected by it’s proximity. It is within walking distance of local commerce (Lidl, bars, restaurants and other shops) as well as the historic buildings and Troglodyte Village area. We did not suffer from any forms of noise pollution or feelings of distress because of the slightly remote location. This parking place is suitable for dog owners. While the alternative suggested village parking area was very definitely not to our liking at the time of our visit. The only slight downside to this location is in selecting a perfectly level parking place..."
22787,67539,1,rodrigo,05/04/2016,"Too far from the city, although it is close to the hospital .."
22853,3249648,3,oah,02/09/2023,"There's no other way to put it, but €40 for one night and one person sleeping in the car (in September) is EXPENSIVE - but it's probably that expensive everywhere here..."
22853,3210386,4,JaumeBausa,24/08/2023,"We booked by email and we had no problem. We arrived, they gave us our assigned place. The truth is that above all you pay for the location and access to the three coves they have. The campsite is big, very big but the organization is quite good. We didn't even go to the pool, since with the coves there we didn't even feel like it. High price, but they are the ones in the area."
22853,3193161,1,JosepVR,21/08/2023,"A disaster, after making a reservation more than a week ago and receiving confirmation of the reservation, we arrived and they tell us that everything is full and that we don't have a place. We show them the confirmation email and their response is that they can't do anything."
22853,3191767,5,DonCmpr,21/08/2023,"Wonderfully located, most spots with sea view and are shaded by big old trees. Animation for kids, three nice beaches (small pebble), small pool area but sufficient. Only the restaurant is just serving deep frozen stuff.  Wifi constantly disconnects and asks to put the password. We'd come again.
50 Eur / night for 2ppl 2 kids"
22853,3183537,5,sizone,19/08/2023,"Me and my girlfriend were doing a road trip on the costa brava and it was simply the BEST camping we have ever done! We remember: the swimming pool with the sea view, the clean and recent sanitary facilities, the pitches in the shade (where we guess a sea view on almost all!), access to the sea in less than 10min on foot with a return by free little train managed by the campsite! 6 nights = 320€ in August!"
22853,3123101,5,IunaGarnier,11/08/2023,"Great campsite perched on the mountain, a bird's eye view of the sea from almost every pitch. 3 beaches accessible from the campsite. Small beach restaurants. A beautiful swimming pool (rather crowded in summer). Friendly animations. A convenience store that helps out well. 8 times we come, do not hesitate if you want to have a good holiday."
22853,3033098,5,CDW1,28/07/2023,"We stayed here for 2 nights (2 adults, €150) on the expensive side but got a place with a super nice view of the sea. We thought this was a really good campsite! The way to the sea is steep downhill."
22853,3015807,2,JenniferPineau,24/07/2023,"Correct reception, but unfortunately we arrived without booking and they made us pay for a camper place while we were in a small VW bus because there was no other place. Campsite too big, location too tight and above all too expensive for what it is (65€/night). I do not recommend for nomadic holidaymakers..."
22853,2982094,5,nathdam,18/07/2023,"We stayed there for 2 nights, it is a very pleasant campsite. We chose the sea view pitch for 3€ more or 55€32/night with electricity included. You need to have good legs because it is very steep. We have a paddle and 10min from the beach by the stairs. Otherwise a small train also accompanies you as close as possible to the beach. A nice stay for us"
22853,2946250,5,Traf74,10/07/2023,Campsite very well located in the pine forest. Direct access to several beautiful coves and coastal path of 3/4 hour to go to Tossa de Mar. Professional and very friendly welcome from the whole team. The toilets are always clean. The swimming pool with sea view is a real plus! We strongly recommend it.
22853,2827287,2,Ilselotte,06/06/2023,"Left again after one night. The tent sites may be very nicely crooked on the terraces, but the RV sites are much less beautiful. Directly next to our place there was a street within the complex, which was also highly frequented by guests of the hotel complex and construction vehicles. Very loud. Washrooms clean, but wide and very steep ways there."
22853,2700426,3,ParkFlo66,27/04/2023,"Nice campsite, sometimes with a sea view. The campsite is large, some pitches are very ""parking"", others larger and under the trees, while others are more intimate but reserved for tents. We spent one night at the end of April, and even out of season the price is too high for the season I think (42€ for 2 people and a small caravan)."
22853,2697359,4,morganech,26/04/2023,"Pleasant campsite with all amenities. Depending on its location, it can be quite far from the toilet blocks. Lots of ups and downs. It is better to be in good physical shape. Surrounded by beautiful beaches and located 3 km from Tossa De Mar."
22853,2631156,3,UweDrees,30/03/2023,"Approached place on 03/29/23. You have to report to the barrier via an intercom. Place is completely empty. Only for mobile homes there is a place near the reception. But they charge €64 for one night or €108 for two nights! Supermarket is open, restaurant is closed. Sanitary facilities are in need of repair. Shower is sufficient and hot. Quiet atmosphere."
22853,2441666,5,thorsten2022,13/10/2022,"Nice places, friendly, a bit long distances, expensive for 5 people 46eur for one night. Open until the end of October"
22853,2438764,4,agnes246,12/10/2022,"Beautiful campsite, beautiful view, clean, beach below."
22853,2437726,3,K.MichaelMayer,11/10/2022,"landscape very beautiful. Space not suitable for large mobile homes. Since everything is divided into terraces, which can only be reached via relatively narrow paths. Offer in October very clear. Everything already closed. supermarket and restaurant. small range of goods in reception. Shower and sanitary in order."
22853,2385152,4,KatjaLenz,19/09/2022,"We were here at the end of September last year when a lot of things were already closed. This year again but at the beginning of September, because we liked it so much. This time there was even a Spanish evening with paella and flamenco Great view, great beaches and water. The back bar on the beach is super good too. The people at the reception were also very nice."
22853,2369711,3,lolozen77,14/09/2022,"Beautiful campsite, too bad for a ☆☆☆☆ in the morning maintains green spaces at 8:30 am hello the grace morning, mini-market which opens at 5:30 pm 37€ per night for a cc two. people, restaurant closed on weekdays in mid-September, what"
22853,2362437,4,GILetKTY,11/09/2022,"Atypical campsite with a beautiful view, 23€ for 1 CC and two people is correct for September. I thought it was a nice place"
22853,2323104,4,MTcamper,30/08/2022,"Super nice campsite. Sanitary facilities are ok. It also depends on who was in there before you. Very nice beaches, but felt 100m deeper. There is a shuttle that takes you back up, but it's often full. WiFi costs extra, which is a shame for a campsite like this. Nevertheless we would come again."
22853,2315772,4,camparavan17,28/08/2022,"Very good camping in general! Clean bathrooms and showers! Barbecue at its points, you cannot barbecue on the same plot! night, August 27, 28, 29. Check-in at 2:00 p.m., check-out at 12:00 p.m."
22853,2299944,4,sbauci,25/08/2022,"Beautiful place, the only known not very accessible to campers. apart from the high pitches, the others require complex maneuvers. nevertheless recommended, surrounded by nature really a campsite in harmony with it."
22853,2099748,4,lolote46,20/07/2022,"very nice clean and pleasant campsite, great on the other hand for people who don't want to walk there are climbs and steps but there is a free train available to go up and down a lot of people in this July season a great view price for a camping car and 3 adults and two children 67euro"
22853,2094171,4,Larada,19/07/2022,"Great location with access to gorgeous beaches. We really appreciated the shuttle service to the beach. There is a deduction for the sanitary facilities, which were not clean at our time or were not cleaned enough. And that Wifi costs extra. From my point of view, these two things are to be expected from a 4-star campsite and the price."
22853,2084275,4,jlnavarro,17/07/2022,Excellent location next to 4 coves. Campsite in the middle of a fairly steep slope.
22853,2070032,4,mindiypelusa,13/07/2022,"Very well located, close to the coves on foot, good services such as swimming pool, showers, bathrooms... I don't give it 5 stars because of the slightly high price, for one night €50 we took the camper and we didn't need electricity..."
22853,2005287,4,Lauracali,24/06/2022,"The campsite is huge and the facilities are quite good, it has 4 beaches that you walk down to and they are very good. We got an uneven plot, but most of them are level. Important: you have to book in high season, it gets very crowded, especially fire pitches."
22853,1996734,5,Zenosek,21/06/2022,"Probably one of the most beautiful campsites I've been to in Spain. Place is on the mountain Places are distributed on routes. Mainly tent sites and mobile homes, but also many caravan sites. Unfortunately only a few in the shade. Sanitary facilities clean. A beautiful beach is located in the bay and can be reached on foot downhill (in the high season a bus runs to the beach every 30 minutes. There is a pool but it is quite small, don't forget your entry bracelet. Tossa de Mar can be reached on foot via a hiking trail or by bus Hour to reach.Last return 19:50."
22853,1977178,5,erstahl,14/06/2022,Very nice campsite with a gorgeous bathing bay (3 bays in total in the immediate vicinity) over a whole mountain slope in the middle of nature. Nice pool area and good supermarket. Sanitary facilities very clean and attractive. Standing right at the entrance in a very generous shady place.
22853,1947907,3,ipulledthepin,05/06/2022,"The good things - huge pitches and the beach access. Can only give it 3 stars because everything feels like a rip off - expensive pitches, WiFi is not free even in bar area and the shop is nearly 50% more expensive than off site. Wish I’d read the reviews about the pitches near the road - cars were driving round the site until nearly 4am, guests were noisy chatting and singing"
22853,1880362,4,jpvd63,09/05/2022,A little corner of paradise if you are lucky enough to have a pitch at the bottom of the campsite facing the sea (access only to vans). Very clean and pleasant toilets. You actually have to stall on many locations.
22853,1873687,5,olivakk,06/05/2022,"We spent one night there - pleasant welcome, spacious and comfortable location despite a slope to be corrected! In any case, level of top services, top sanitary facilities, pleasant beach access despite a good descent! Nice family place. A good address to keep at a fair price of around €40 for a Cc and 2 adults, a child and a baby."
22853,1815524,5,Entdeckerin,11/04/2022,"Very nice staff, great views and great beaches. I was only one night so I can't judge the area, but at first glance very inviting to go hiking. I found the campsite very comfortable and nicely integrated with nature. I also thought the washrooms were great, but I can only compare them to a few German campsites. 40 for one person, van and dog"
22853,1678550,5,MagCros,05/11/2021,"Closed on November 2. We spent one night there on October 30, it was very nice, nice campsite hanging on the cliff. Well adjusted. Small beach at the bottom of the mountain. Note that the town of Tossa is a bit far away."
22853,1677488,3,sultimulti,04/11/2021,Camping closed
22853,1663952,4,JerVil1,26/10/2021,"Quiet campsite in the off season, superb location on private coves. sanitary facilities worthy of a 4 *, affordable price."
22853,1644042,4,alexihle,14/10/2021,"Beautiful location, with access to awesome beaches. But every Restaurant is closed due to off-season. Also pitches close to the roads are not recommended. There are also apartments on the premises, which are accessed with cars and motorcycles day and night. This is a bit disturbing to the otherwise quiet atmosphere."
22853,1588969,4,Ueberlandfahrer,18/09/2021,"A great place with a great view, just not in front of the reception on the top left of the squares, as ALL the cars in the settlement drive past there, stop or turn around. Good beach, good sanitary facilities…. We will be back."
22853,1549252,2,Oihaniii,05/09/2021,"The location of the campsite exceptional. However, very bad management. We would not recommend this campsite to people who are looking for a night for the van. They offered us 3 pitches (one did not fit the van and the other 2 were on a slope and on a curve) They offered us another plot that to our surprise was occupied. Literally 2h walking around in search of a decent plot"
22853,1537810,5,Waeggerli,01/09/2021,"Great campsite that deserves its 4 stars. Very large, great sanitary facilities and clean. Washing machine and tumbler. 3 beaches within walking distance, 2 by shuttle. Stayed 2 nights, 31.08-02.09. Camper, 2 pers. and electricity € 36. Highly recommended"
22853,1519772,5,manri,27/08/2021,"We have been 4 days and we liked it, it has a shuttle service to the beach, an SUV that takes you up and down continuously"
22853,1487892,3,lemonevil,20/08/2021,The best without a doubt the location. Cool coves. The price € 55 per night with electricity (they did not give the option to not use electricity). The normal facilities and circulating with the van inside to enter or exit was not the most comfortable.
22853,1469299,4,vanvuuren,17/08/2021,"Really a great camping site. We felt very safe and enjoyed every day. Toilettes and showers are ok and clean. There is a restaurant (really good food) a supermarket, BBQ and lots of shady pitches. As the site is located on a hill, there are stairs and walk ways to get to the three main beaches. A walk through the forrest to Tossa de Mar was our highlight and concluded a very nice stay."
22853,1322919,3,Saragarsan,14/07/2021,"I give it 3 stars for the location, it has access to very beautiful and quiet coves, the plot we were on was the best, quiet and overlooking the sea. Regarding the facilities: they are fair, they need some other repair and more cleaning. The staff does not know much ... to the bar better not to go, slow and not very competent service."
22853,1302059,4,PaulaFerrer,06/07/2021,"Huge campsite with access to 3 coves. To go to Tossa there is an option by bus that costs € 2.20 (leaving the campsite, go up to the top and wait in front of a small pond that is on the right, about 15 minutes on foot from the reception). Peaceful camping. With supermarket. It would improve the cleanliness of the bathrooms."
22853,1270971,4,MariellaRuijsch,22/06/2021,"Lovely terraced campsite with beautiful views. Beach accessible by stairs. Tossa via a path through the forest at 3 km, but a steep climb through hilly area. Restaurant and supermarket were still closed. Camper pitches were of normal size, but sharp bends and steep roads to reach the pitch. Sanitary clean and in good condition. Electricity 15 amps."
22853,868316,2,franc.reyes,14/07/2020,"It was one of my best options to go camping in Tossa, I have been going for quite some time. I say it was because since they have changed owners they have gone backwards. This weekend that we went the camping was very neglected closed men's room they enabled a single and shared bathroom"
22853,862077,1,prietillo,11/07/2020,"Bad experience. It does not comply with the sanitary measures that are currently required. Lack of personnel, closed bathrooms and those that have been left open are mixed and quite dirty. We were surprised that the chemical toilet tank is located in the same bathroom, next to the toilets. Abandoned campsite, small pitches and slopes. Those with sea views, some without shade and more expensive than others. I do not recommend it."

22853,859124,2,mokka6789,10/07/2020,"Note: Price for 1 night, electricity and 2 people in a camper van € 34"
22853,859118,2,mokka6789,10/07/2020,"Beaches and sea super nice. Sanitary facilities rather moderate, partially closed. In addition, we only had facilities for women that were used by both genders because of the closed men's bathroom facilities. Restaurant closes its kitchen at 9:00 p.m. according to German standards, if you are used to Spanish you should keep this in mind ;-) Pool area nice. Paths to the beach partly not cleared of the undergrowth, at night we were surprised by a wild boar at our place (we had been allocated a place at the bottom towards the beach). Summary: Sea / beach great, sanitary facilities and well-kept campground so-so, we would come back, but take a place in the upper rows (sometimes even sea view). Attention: large motorhomes and caravans are only possible in the upper places because of the narrow streets!"
22853,857277,1,cucopatinas,09/07/2020,They do not allow motorhomes. Only fixed people !!!! Amazing.
22853,772993,5,Albert_Challenger,27/01/2020,"We were at the end of September, a campsite located in a very cool place"
22853,707999,3,JoseArkadio,29/09/2019,"Beautiful area. Very good sights. Nice swimming pool.
Only few bathrooms, and many steps to take to reach them (Beach the same). Beware of that. And during night impossible to achieve becouse of wild pig running around the tents. It can be dangerous but mostly looking for garbage. After 9pm was seen every night.
40e/3 persons/1 night - low season.
Car you can park sometimes far from your pitch."
22853,707199,5,MaRa812,28/09/2019,"Very nice campsite with a beautiful view! Toilet and shower were clean, we spent one night there (2 people and car) and paid 36 €."
22853,706915,4,Rony1729,28/09/2019,"Superb camping, quite expensive but with beautiful beaches and benefits ... Worth a visit."
22853,697870,5,Gustavulli,20/09/2019,Extremely clean place with beautiful individual pitches. Best CP Supermarket we have seen in all our travels. We recommend. Dream beach with crystal clear water.
22853,677592,3,Blackietopper,05/09/2019,"Stayed 2 nights on 4/9/19. €31 each night  with electric and water. We didn’t pre book - at the moment it would cost €36 a night if booking online!  The previous owners sold the site to Sea Green a French company in January 2019 so there are a few administrating problems!  Very clean toilets and lovely big shower cubicles. We went to reception on arrival and told we could choose where we wanted to park. The spaces are big and very well shaded. There is a nice pool, bar and restaurant on site but the beach bars are sub contracted out. The staff at these were not very well informed of the free shuttle service back to the site which was a big issue if you don’t know where to get it from!  We walked back up which was very very steep. Not a good site for people with mobility issues. Other than that it was very safe and secure. Taxi into Tossa town which is not at all like Benidorm was €13 each way. Standard fare set by the Spanish government. Great place to relax."
22853,570639,3,AntonioMG,23/07/2019,"Camping about 5 km from Tossa de Mar. Very large, with different areas, pool and access to coves. Jeep service to access beaches, restaurant, supermarket (has practically everything). Old bathrooms and dishwashers but cared for. Regular cleaning of these. Very friendly staff: we changed location because they gave us a very small one and there were no problems. Expensive like the whole Costa Brava in summer. € 110 for two nights without electricity Van + 2 adults + 2 girls"
22853,545655,5,prettylatina,09/07/2019,"Very nice campsite. In July 2019: 31 € for the Bulli and two people, without electricity. We had a great view of the bay but a pretty small plot. The sanitary facilities are clean and well maintained. There is beach access and a shuttle service that goes up and down. A restarant, supermarket and ATM are also there."
22853,542499,5,Tsopir,07/07/2019,Beautiful campsite with three creeks exclusive to the campsite. Any comfort 4 * very good reception and calm. We spent 2 nights in a truck set up for 70 euros. We recomend it!
22853,522024,4,marina72,20/06/2019,"Super friendly, everything you need with supermarket / restaurant / bar. Nice views and not too busy at this time. Very calm"
22853,518159,3,Argfra,16/06/2019,"Beautiful coves that are accessed by roads in great slope. Beautiful pool Small plots, difficult with large campers, noisy, normal bathrooms, restaurant closes 9h30pm. The noise ruins everything, reception not very good"
22853,496231,5,pschmoor,29/05/2019,"Super camping, very clean, impeccable health, very friendly welcome ... small downside: sloping movements .... but the plots are flat. Path to Tossa to do, a little steep just at the beginning, with beautiful panoramas and arrival above the castle"
22853,493666,4,nass73,26/05/2019,"A very beautiful campsite a nice view. 21 € with reduction camping-cariste card. 2 people and a dog. We must leave the site for 12h, while on others it was 17h, only downside."
22853,490553,4,carterondelamusse,23/05/2019,"Huge campsite in the pines with beautiful locations with sea views for some locations, close sea but down stairs many steps, beautiful beaches, impeccable toilets, washing machines, dish trays etc .., great pool, supermarket good price € 20 (May 20, 2019)"
22853,459007,5,nathalou44,19/04/2019,A great campsite at this time of the year because it must be full in the summer given the number of locations. We stayed 4 nights so we found it good. Direct beach access. Sanitary impeccable. Forest trail to go tossa with beautiful view. Friendly and welcoming staff. Correct restaurant. a mini market with everything you need and fresh bread in the morning. We will come back next year for sure
22853,418040,1,Jeffcath,30/12/2018,Closed at this time. Very disappointed because very crappy road.
22853,401231,3,Gladysontour,30/10/2018,We paid €26 for one night no electric-think they just needed the money as it closes on 1/11/18. View was spectacular - good shop on site but shabby toilets and showers. It will be packed in the summer and over run with mosquitoes-steep walk to the beach so choose your pitch wisely!
22853,382771,5,LaMereDenis,26/09/2018,"2 nights in early July. Clean and comfortable, quiet and well placed (the sea is at the foot after a descent of several dozen steps however, it's worth a look)! We enjoyed this campsite"
22853,378248,5,camillou33,20/09/2018,"Camping very well, price 20.50 € per night for a motorhome and a person, friendly staff, swimming pool, supermercado, bar all that to drain on leaving, electricity etc ... paradisiac beaches at the bottom of the campsite. Only flat center of Tossa 3 km walk (hiking trail) or car or bike."
22853,374680,4,matemyla,16/09/2018,Beautiful campsite very well located. beautiful view of the creek. clean with any benefit. very calm. Van location to choose from with views of the creek. Very nice home.
22853,371507,5,leoisien,12/09/2018,"Superb camping, spacious sanitary and very maintained, wild coves, the top: grilled fish on the beach restaurant! We will come back, and for the slackers access beach with a 2 motorized wheels ... otherwise on foot it is quite physical .."
22853,300355,5,machoute2,25/07/2018,"Nice camping. No noise. Choice of location on arrival. I did not have a reservation. Sanitary very clean. Access to the beach. Bus for Tossa de Mar. Price: 28 € 50 for the camper, 9 € 50 per adult and about 7 € for children, plus tourist tax of 0,50 € per day and per person."
22853,299683,1,arthur13,24/07/2018,"We did not like it. Too many climbs and descents inside the campsite, walking on foot are tiring, poor location and expensive in season"
22853,294120,5,RBGELX,20/07/2018,"We were passing and we stayed 2 nights, the views from our spectacular plot, accepted the acsi, and the coves are also very nice."
22853,269991,5,T4ontheroad,17/06/2018,This is a nice campsite in a fantastic location. One of the beautiful bays is nudist beach.
22853,268133,4,paulinehouz,13/06/2018,"We stayed for one night, the campsite is very big and has a great view of the sea. There is a pool, mini market, restaurant and direct access to the beach. But the price is expensive, we paid in the off season 29,65 € plus 0,50 € stay tax per person for a location with electricity."
22853,264592,4,denech17,06/06/2018,"Beautiful campsite with friendly reception. Very nice view, and beautiful beaches. Paid 27 euros a night in low season and without electricity. Expensive."
22853,254805,5,advanturelovers.de,18/05/2018,"Despite the size of one of the most beautiful campgrounds ever. Tent sites are even more beautiful with a view of the sea. Otherwise everything available. Even its own large supermarket also open on Sundays. Only drawback. Internet is very expensive. Internet 1h for 2 €, 24h for 6 €. Nice hike to Tossa de Mar. The four sandy beaches are great. Greetings Advanturelovers.de"
22853,250185,4,Francky33,10/05/2018,Always so nice! Excellent welcome but € 27 off season it starts to be high ... everyone does not have the Acsi card
22853,235340,5,eric3301,10/04/2018,"Very well placed for lovers of cycling (mountain bike or road). Beach nearby however watch out for the climb to come back. Outside period 19 € electricity included with the ACSI card. Clean campsite at this time and nice. Home really nice, in high season, I think it must be madness."
22853,194763,5,UlliStremmel,17/09/2017,"Well equipped campsite on the most beautiful corner of the Costa Brava. Terraces above the sea, 4 beautiful sandy pebble beaches 5 min walk away."
22853,193618,4,silviacacabelos,14/09/2017,"We spent one night in this campsite, two adults and one van: € 26.45 in September. Cheap and quiet place, pets allowed and most importantly, there is barbecue (you have to bring grill). The downside is that it is all in cost."
22853,68116,5,Francky33,10/04/2016,Camping nice and quiet in this season (it must be very different in August ...) stabilized sites for motorhomes with sea views for some. Sanitary clean
22854,1158128,1,JaviS.Adamuz,26/03/2021,"As of today, it is still closed, only for visits to the Monastery of El Paular."

22854,732819,3,ealonsoa75,28/10/2019,"Without services, parking of the Monastery, very well located to start hiking trails and walk to the town of Rascafria. The paste is that it is saturated as a rule. Some monastery workers told me that parking will soon be regulated. At night it is very quiet to spend the night."
22854,508428,5,locosporlasalsa,08/06/2019,Perfect quiet place and hopefully you have shade during the day. during the day it gets up to the perfect place to spend the night to know the town walking 2km and make routes all perfect

22854,363158,3,Jmrsantin,02/09/2018,Eye Close at 8pm and open at 11. Rascafria at 20min walking. The very recommended clips and the route to the purgatory waterfall very interesting

22854,110240,4,robertoph,16/10/2016,"The Paular is a wonderful place. Do not miss the guided tour of the monastery. Also visit the Giner de los Rios arboretum and the walk through the Finnish forest. remember that it is a parking lot, not a campig. be discreet to let us stay overnight."
22855,3089154,4,nidia1888,06/08/2023,"Free if you only go to sleep at night. We arrived around 9 p.m. and it was practically empty, we left at 10, and we were not charged anything. Overnight stays allowed, 5 euros per camper or motorhome if it is to spend the day. Fairly flat dirt parking, has a bench and picnic table. Few shadows, views of the swamp."
22855,2862312,3,Marta_GS,17/06/2023,"Wide and flat esplanade, it has 3 tables and two garbage cans. We have arrived on Friday (09/16/2023) at 9:00 p.m., we have left on Saturday at 9:00 a.m. and the man from the parking lot has let us leave without paying. On the sign it says that parking is paid on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. They put a piece of paper on our windshield wipers warning us that if we did not pay before 12:00 p.m. they could fine us."
22855,2847498,4,cuevadefernando,12/06/2023,"Good access for any size vehicle, paying on weekends and holidays. Without services, overnight stays allowed."

22855,2564376,5,giselaCutanda,30/01/2023,"I have come to see him, who was passing through... next to the town. There are routes. I have not seen that sign that you have to pay nor have I seen a sign prohibiting overnight stays."
22855,2549907,5,Israman,12/01/2023,"We spent here the night of 12/28/22. It's a perfect place, free on weekdays. It has garbage cans. One step away from the small town of Lozoya. A good strategic point with good views."
22855,2504625,1,Depaula,24/11/2022,"Great place, flat, sandy floor, spacious and with good views. The churrería at 100m, be careful! at this time it is only open on weekends."

22855,2228494,1,androidedelio,13/08/2022,these days it is paid
22855,1926749,4,efren123,29/05/2022,"hello, very good, the area is spectacular, the parking is very good with views of the reservoir, then you have good routes, the only bad thing is that you cannot swim."
22855,1906884,3,crespojsanz,22/05/2022,"If you go after 7pm they don't charge you for the night, but in the morning they come to your van to tell you that you have to pay 6 euros for the day and the following night if you want to stay. They only charge on weekends, the parking lot has enough space but very few tables. The good thing is that it is surrounded by bars and shops to buy, the routes in the area are not very varied and you do not have access to the lake"
22855,1734250,4,reyi,15/01/2022,"We have spent the night from Friday to Saturday, other times there was a person at the entrance charging, today they do not charge anyone. I guess they will charge again with good weather"
22855,1732947,4,jesushortal,12/01/2022,"Well located and, today, we have not been charged. We have only stopped to take a walk, shop at the supermarket, and eat (very well, in the sun at Restaurante Fernando)"

22855,1586008,5,rositapawa,17/09/2021,"Nice place to sleep. It costs € 6 but we arrived when the girl was gone and in the morning since we were not going to stay she told us that it was not necessary to pay. Very kind. Right opposite there is a churrería that is great to go in the morning if you fancy having churros and porras for breakfast. True, the issue of the townspeople who go at night to drink bottles but away from the tables is worth it."
22855,1578928,1,okcorral,14/09/2021,"We had been coming here for more than two years and we loved it, now, in addition to charging € 6 for parking, the town's catetitos give them to make a bottle ALL NIGHT. What a pity of place ..."
22855,1527304,3,ClarayAlberto,29/08/2021,"Perfect place to sleep at the entrance of the town and do routes, this time when I went you had to pay, I went and looked for another place, but if you don't mind paying it is a flat, quiet space close to nature"
22855,1520619,4,azuvivi,27/08/2021,"Now they charge on weekends and holidays. in the specific sign that it is allowed to spend the night, we have been here before the summer and it was free."

22855,1441102,1,ofrios,11/08/2021,"They charge €6 to motorhomes for dirt parking and without services, it seems excessive to me."
22855,1296339,3,bobyrame,04/07/2021,It was € 6 motorhome payment. for the day it is very well located although it does not have services. garbage and drinking fountain nearby. the night MASSIVE BOTTLES !!! IMPOSSIBLE TO SLEEP. A PENALTY THAT IS NOT CONTROLLED.
22855,1226138,4,ALIRDAJI,30/05/2021,"Good parking, very good for a walk bordering the swamp, although the day we were there there were a lot of pollen and mosquitoes. I advise that to sleep not to park where the tables and benches are, to park right in front. It was Saturday and until 3 in the morning we had kids talking and at 8 in the morning others not so kids again. Still, it's worth it."
22855,1214195,5,yolytortola,23/05/2021,"Very good place, large parking, no noise and very well connected, we will definitely return"
22855,1203821,5,Alejan_86,17/05/2021,"Area enabled for motorhomes, located next to the town and in a very beautiful natural environment. Some garbage containers are missing, although outside there is a specific organic one for compost generation, which I think is a very good initiative."
22855,1190649,3,Palayo,09/05/2021,"They have changed and that parking lot is no longer allowed access to motorhomes, they have enabled a plot next to them for them, they indicate that in the near future it will be paid. There is a nearby restaurant that has outdoor facilities, the music can be heard a lot, but with the restrictions it closes and afterwards you can sleep peacefully."
22855,1185841,4,taniacamarillo,05/05/2021,"In this parking lot they did not leave motorhomes because they had enabled the one next to grass, we have been on the bridge very quiet, on Sunday we were a lot, like 30, the truth is that very well, the location is ideal, between the town and the swamp and It's free. The churros at the kiosk are very good, I recommend them!"

The place is beautiful with hiking and bike routes for children. I recommend buying churros for breakfast. thanks to the mayor."
22855,1183024,1,family599,01/05/2021,"In this parking lot (the free land one) they have put up a sign forbidden motorhomes, they refer you to the one next to the closed lawn. Maybe it's because it's a holiday (May bridge), I don't know."
22855,1174228,5,balooui,15/04/2021,Charming place. Close to the town with beautiful views. Bike path with a very nice route that leaves from the same esplanade. Very spacious. The weekend before Easter we were about 30 motorhomes. Churrería next door. Garbage at the entrance to the parking lot. It also has a water source.
22855,1162269,4,ccp82,31/03/2021,"The site is amazing, on Easter Wednesday they very kindly moved us to another location in the town to leave that parking for cars very understandable since many cars were waiting, the super affectionate woman from the supermarket and Serna bar highly recommended"

22855,1143440,4,Iber,27/02/2021,"It's a shame it doesn't have loading and emptying. I would have given it five stars. It is a magnificent place, the town too. From now on I'm going to put the spending I make in these places to see if it reaches the city councils and they see what we spend, and so they treat us better. €60 between groceries, beers, churros and dinner at El Rincón del Paulino restaurant."
22855,1137940,5,bdepablo,16/02/2021,"Very comfortable parking to walk around the reservoir, visit the town and shop in a small nearby supermarket. It is spacious and with some picnic area. There are playgrounds nearby."
22855,1135988,5,AlexyMontse,08/02/2021,"We arrived on a Sunday at noon and there were quite a few cars and vans/ACs. At night it was just us, we slept very peacefully with the sound of running water. Level, with bins, benches. The only downside is that if it rains it's all mud."

22855,1055833,5,Tui,18/09/2020,"It has a water source. Containers (yellow and organic). Trash cans in the same area and some tables but there is hardly any shade. The only bad thing is that people hardly use the trash cans and everything goes on the floor in the table area. Otherwise I agree: good area, next to bars and shops, and quite flat."
22855,868520,1,Tximo,14/07/2020,"Well located and with plenty of space, but at night there were people partying. We had a bad night."

22855,725894,5,ArcaDream,20/10/2019,We spent a night with no problem and no noise. There is no service but there are bars right in front and paths leave from the parking lot to walk and ride a bike through the reservoir
22855,672741,1,natbee,02/09/2019,"It is a vacant parking lot without shadows where you can park. The views overlook the part of the swamp where the treatment plant is, without any charm, and so the smell is not very pleasant. I recommend going to the other side of the swamp in Pinilla del Valle, near with better services and views."
22855,89118,1,pompom78,04/08/2016,"On August 3rd, we passed our way because car park occupied by fairgrounds"

22873,3259440,1,NCDMOUNTAIN,04/09/2023,"Too many bottles everywhere... after that, at 7:30 the gardeners with the vandalized ones in the park and, of course, the traffic on the street. hahaha, we haven't had any luck, but you won't see us here again. A pity that the city council does not take care of it."
22873,3247049,2,pabloykathy,01/09/2023,"First when cars arrived occupying a car space, then the ITV truck came and they made us park in front of it, of all the extension that is here they have bridges, you have to put it right here?? and now you want to empty and fill it and you can't either unfortunate!! I give it two stars for how well we ate at the restaurant below 7 camiños! €11 already bursting…"
22873,2883594,3,cosmea5,23/06/2023,"Was able to empty and refill water here. Thanks to the city for the free service. You can cycle or walk to the lake, but then you would have to park somewhere else, as only limited parking is allowed here despite the marked parking area."
22873,2526175,3,Arto2018,22/12/2022,"The pictures of the water/lake are totally misleading, that doesn't exist here. The parking lot is on the side of the road and is therefore not quiet but very centrally located."
22873,2192049,3,camperrinos,07/08/2022,Very small area. It does not allow the stop to rest. We didn't have the faucet adapter and we couldn't fill it. Otherwise well.

There is parking available for the night and a few meters away is the local police, a very quiet area. At about 4 'in Camper is the river beach to have a good time on hot days.

It’s in the same spot as in the grays, it has toilet paint right next to the gray grille but it’s barely noticeable. We put a flange on the grid itself so we could lift it more easily and unload the blacks without a hitch. Wide road without problems for parking and maneuvering and easy access."

You can easily get to Lisbon by taxi (26€ to the city centre) or by ferry (taxi 6€+ferry 2€ pp). You should choose a parking space in the middle, then you won't hear anything from the street noise. Perfect for a trip to Lisbon."

Aircraft noise and traffic noise do not seriously disturb. 10min to the bus that goes straight to Lisbon. Or alternatively to the ferry that translates to Lisbon.

22875,2804433,4,tassietravelers,30/05/2023,Great park - just a little bit pricey. We used Uber (about €4-5) to the ferry at Trafaria and across to Belém and into Lisbon. Perfect. Good laundromat nearby - shame that the laundry at the campsite being renovated. We had dinner in the cafe one night and enjoyed it.
22875,2800983,2,Anniesway,29/05/2023,"We were on the edge of the campsite, actually on the main street. So noisy. Old sanitary facilities, but reasonably clean. Not a campsite to stay for a long time, but good for a visit to Lisbon. Plumbing really needs to be replaced, price / quality is not ok"

With ANWB camping card 10% discount, so we paid 72.25 euros for 3 nights plus electricity for a 5.99 meter camper. WIFI is fine but do they turn it off when the reception is closed!!??

But Friday evening 3 rows behind the street you could only hear BOOM, boom, boom from a discotheque on the other side of the street until midnight... Sanitary facilities not so great, but warm showers ;-) A lot of permanent campers at the places near the beach. Small, narrow streets (trees). The little supermarket is great."
22875,2698812,4,chregu83,26/04/2023,Ideal for visiting Lisbon. With UBER to the ferry and back again. Everything available. We were able to choose our place ourselves in April. Approx. Euro 20.- for a van and two people without electricity.

That said, the CC area is along the street and therefore very noisy. and they are invaded by processionary caterpillars which they try to eradicate. So be careful, especially for the dog, since the campsite is planted with pines..."

Very old bathrooms that look like something out of a horror movie. Dry, rude and unfriendly employees. To stop for 1 day and that's it. The buses for Lisbon and Trafaria do not keep timetables. Rent a car service in Almada, 6km away (Herzt). Until there, a taxi costs about €7."
22875,2172348,5,henry2110,04/08/2022,"Nice place with shady spots right on the Costa da Caparica. Friendly staff. Supermarket and restaurant on the square. We were there in August, when the highest price level applies. We have with 2 pers. paid €25.9 per night with campervan without electricity. If you want to go to Lisbon by bus or train, you should find out about the timetables beforehand. It's sometimes complicated."
22875,2127669,5,Bibiche013,26/07/2022,"Pleasant and perfect campsite for visiting Lisbon. Possibility to get there by ferry, bus or Uber at a lower cost. We paid 33€ per night at 4 including electricity. We did not use the common areas."
22875,2081282,4,Raulchiri,16/07/2022,a modest but very cozy campsite. impressive beaches and a large park to enjoy with children or pets
22875,1919830,2,gp38,27/05/2022,"Very average campsite but at a very high price for the services. Tiny showers, very old. You have to choose your shower carefully because half of them are unusable. And, as more and more, the CCs are parked on area-type pitches, without shade and without a reduction in price, without necessarily the advantage of being on stabilized ground. Prefer the Cascais campsite just as close to Lisbon."
22875,1911341,3,mariu2021,24/05/2022,"Very large campsite, with the central part occupied by permanent residents. Services under sized compared to the amount of people, old and not particularly clean but acceptable. I would say the only alternative to the campsite in Lisbon from which it is about 40 minutes away either by public transport or by ferry. € 30 camper two people electricity and a dog, a little high price for the services offered."
22875,1901933,1,zenruffinen,20/05/2022,"Sanitary facilities dilapidated and in poor condition. We are asked 12 euros to wash and dry clothes, a price never seen before and we do not even receive detergent. Apparently there are no more. The machines are not marked to know which washes and which dries."
22875,1899397,2,reisefreak1,19/05/2022,"Positive: Proximity to the long beach, Sani older, but clean, sufficiently large pitches Negative: many permanent camper caravans that are neglected when the residents are absent. Some cars park wildly on parcels, although they are not permitted. The biggest annoyance for us was the wrong information about the way to Lisbon, as it was far too long and time-consuming."
22875,1898877,4,fjoigneau,18/05/2022,"To go to Lisbon, an Uber is 17€ so easier than the bus. Otherwise, quite small location and no complaints about the cleanliness of the toilets Hot shower Direct access to the beach via a gate with a walk for several kms, ideal for jogging"

People have moved and complained but nothing happens. We want our money back and move out tomorrow. So angry and sooo tired… Can’t recommend this place.

22875,1816156,5,Saschke,11/04/2022,"We were there for almost 2 weeks. We paid €13 per night for 2 people and a camper with ADAC in the off-season. Toilets very clean, especially in the back part of the square where we were standing, where you can hardly hear the street. Beach access is open during the day. The place is very well monitored and you feel completely safe. We will come back."
22875,1814147,1,gretchen1501,10/04/2022,"A good way to visit Lisbon. Unfortunately, there are few alternatives to the campsite and this is also extremely exploited here. Sanitary facilities and pitches are carelessly and very poorly maintained. In general, one has the feeling that a pleasant stay for the customer is not a priority here. But the prices are more expensive than some other 5-star campsites."
22875,1787381,4,jorgeyrut,19/03/2022,29 euros in low season 2 people and 2 dogs. Close to the road although it does not bother. nice walk to the beach. Generally good.

22875,1733549,5,AndreaRalfMo,13/01/2022,"Very nice CP. Bus is within walking distance. However, we tended to use Uber. The CP is clean. Showers warm and toilets are constantly cleaned. We paid 22 € with electricity. The only disadvantage is, unfortunately, that there is only cold water to wash the dishes. But you can rule that."
22875,1728146,4,Ladoum,06/01/2022,"In January camping casi empty, the beach is 5 minutes on foot and the walk along the beach is most pleasant. Clean sanitary facilities, wifi in some places of the campsite. Small supermarket nearby. Join Lisboa by bus (stop near the campsite) and ferry to Belem. Efficient reception. Covid test compulsory at the entrance, they sell the test for € 2.75."
22875,1712554,2,tesszaldua,19/12/2021,"We went with a car with a rigid tent on the roof (they always charge us as a van or motorhome) and we arrived at night. A security one signed a paper where it said that we were going with a car and a separate tent (more expensive) and that the next day the reception would make it good for us. Even knowing that it was not like that, they made us pay 22 euros because the boy from the night before had done the wrong part. After discussing it, he tells us that they do not make alterations and that it cannot be changed and that we have to ask for the money by email, that he cannot give it to us."

Otherwise, beautiful beaches 5 minutes away. Negative points: OBITUR campsite therefore expensive even in September, excessive electricity supplement of 4 EUR, fortunately we could do without ... Some noise pollution also due to air traffic."

It has a bar and supermarket with the basics. A few meters from the campsite there is a supermarket. Quiet at night.

We were able to visit Lisbon thanks to the bus as well as Sintra with the train in addition. We have € 42.5 for 3 adults (adult from 11 years old) and 1 child with electricity. It just lacks a swimming pool and I put 5 stars.
22875,1374065,3,armindyoga,28/07/2021,"The price isn’t right. Make sure to ask how much it will cost you to stay here before registration.

22875,230446,1,decarreaux,28/03/2018,Camping very expensive for the proposed service € 24.10 for a motorhome two people and a dog. Moreover despite the ASCI sign we are told at the reception that they do not take this card (mouais ...). The sites are overgrown with grass and the sites not overlooking the boulevard are inaccessible with a large motorhome because impossible to maneuver in narrow alleys

22875,197678,3,sylser,25/09/2017,Ideal campsite to enjoy the wide sandy beach of Costa Caparica. To go to Lisbon just board the ferry for a few euros (crossing 1/4 of an hour).
22875,189909,4,mocha,04/09/2017,"We spent a night there and great. Clean beds, hot water, supermarket, good atmosphere ... it has many places for Camper and AC, although not all with shade, there are plots that are in full sun and planes usually pass frequently, but the noise is bearable. To visit Lisbon you can take the bus or the ferry from Trafaria like us (it does not reach € 3 round trip) .Recommendable!"

22881,3122579,3,GeorgeSoff,11/08/2023,We paid €22 for a mini-plot (small van). The correct facilities (clean bathrooms but little pressure in the shower).
22881,2936231,4,ul.schmid,08/07/2023,"Beautiful and spacious place. Nice and clean wet rooms. Sand courts really problematic when it rains. The price of 44 euros for 2 people and 1 bus is at the upper limit. Attention, check the bill carefully in the restaurant, there were 10.40 euros too much on the bill, which was refunded after a great deal of discussion. The food was excellent."
22881,2904536,3,Orienteur,29/06/2023,"Not as idyllic as advertised. Certainly with access to the corn beach under a busy road. Expensive compared to other sites. The restaurant is expensive compared to other small restaurants in the country, and to top it off the menu is accessible by scanning a QR Code. As if you never did without your smartphone. In short, for one night it is acceptable but not enough to invite you to stay."
22881,2866566,4,Maktedelic,18/06/2023,"The madness! Campsite directly on the white sandy beach. Sanitary facilities are cleaned once a day at midnight. There is even toilet paper and warm water. You have to bring your own soap. Restaurant with sea view (cheap menu for campsite guests; rather mediocre food, but great service) When we were there, there was a power outage for two days. Diesel generator was set up quickly."

22881,2776781,3,lhartwig,22/05/2023,The place is a better pitch. The places are very tight. The street above the square can be heard loudly. Only Spanish was spoken at reception. The price of 25€ for 2 people + 1 van was collected without explanation. This could not be derived from the price list. Only the beach is a highlight. The pitches directly on the beach are extremely narrow and can only be reached via a ramp.
22881,2766661,5,ja50n0,20/05/2023,"Nice campsite, yes the seafront pitches are a little untidy, but the view is what you pay for. The cafe/bar/restaurant is really nice, we paid £29 for a 4 course meal with 2 beers for 2 people, great value. There is very little road noise at night, the showers can be a little cold if you use them at the wrong time of day, but they're fairly clean as are the toilets and there are plenty of them."

The pitches were a bit worn when we were there, and the loos had seen better days but it’s a good spot. Quick walk down some steps to the beach. Dolphins around 6pm if you’re lucky. Nice walks to the light house or into the hills for a back route to Muros. Suggest the lower strip"

They charged us €38 ""for a pack"" of two people with a camper that includes electricity and a car (two services that we did not want). We asked why they don't charge us only what we need (as in any campsite) and they told us not to pay attention to the broken down prices. Surreal. Expensive cafeteria. Small portions for the price.

22881,2079029,2,Costablanca,16/07/2022,Very small plots so you are camping too close to the other neighbors. A price too expensive for what they offer you in this campsite.

Electricity is not provided, but a little tip: If you park at number one and your cable drum is long enough, you can use the socket (stucco) on the terrace of the restaurant, works on everyone. There is nothing to drain gray water and black water. But the view is worth it on everyone."

Half of the places are not accessible because of tree branches too low (risk of scratches or other damage ...). We are packed like sardines.

Downside of the place is that the see weed is unpredictable and could cause dodgy beaches. Overall ok place and make sure you have cash money!"

22885,2577858,3,PabloMejuto,14/02/2023,"It's good that there is a Camper area and that's why I give 3 stars. I do not give 5 because to go up to the emptying area there is a curb as if you were going up on the sidewalk, they have not made a recess or ramp and it is difficult to go up in addition to the blow that you get into the vehicle both when going up and down The water tap does not have threaded and no screwed-in hose quick connector"

There is only one tap Which does not have a normal threaded fitting so will have to use a bucket . No actual designated bays but plenty of space. Warning market stalls come to this town on the 5th and 20th of each month, and we were asked by the market traders to move as they wanted to set up their stalls. This might be a temporary thing as the town square is being dug up where  the rest of the stalls normally set up. There is a pleasant riverside walk.

Large car parks are not indicated as such either. But it is a nice place to be and enjoy. When passing the highway nearby there is a continuous background noise.

everything you need.

and a great stop as my wife is,walking g the Camino Engles.....better than a dirt park up at Hodpital de Bruma..."

22920,2543575,3,DaisyAndOlaf,06/01/2023,The location is very nice. But it has not been easy to access the narrow roads and many curves in addition to passing under 5 bridges. The parking lot is small but we spent the night alone and in peace. The truth is that we do not use the services since the black water discharge has the same clean water intake to fill. Otherwise the park is fine next to a lake with a walk
22920,2514337,5,sabbronza,06/12/2022,"The best equipped free parking area I've ever seen. Spotless bathrooms (and toilet paper) free showers available (no hot water), picnic area with barbecue and tables, children's play area, waste water discharge and even a slow food restaurant which if we had stayed we would have certainly tried!!!! 30 minutes from A Coruña in a super well-kept and green setting."

22920,2258665,5,EugeniaV,18/08/2022,"A beautiful place, perfect to spend a day with the family, the reservoir is lake-like and there is a path to take a walk. Many pilgrims pass through to Santiago. The only thing they are doing is a swimming pool and before 8am they have started with construction machinery and concrete mixer, but hey, it will be enjoyed next summer. It has many tables and a park. We liked the place a lot, yes, it is not easy to get there"

The place seems to be close to the main road, but is 20 minutes away through minor roads. We were just passing through so didn't stay, when we arrived around 21:00 there were still a lot of cars parked, so we parked on the elevation a bit further."
22920,2076413,5,FrancescoN.,15/07/2022,"Free parking very quiet and isolated with loading / unloading in the middle of nature. There are tables, free outdoor showers and toilets with toilet paper. There is a non-swimming pond, many mosquitoes in the evening. A stop for those who make the Camino de Santiago. 4 or 5 stalls in all suitable for even large campers. It is better to arrive in the evening because the Spaniards park their cars during the day."
22920,2050035,4,mike41,08/07/2022,"Superb place, very frequented by the Spaniards. Too bad there is no sign at the place of the emptying area, because the cars park there. Nice walk around the lake."

22920,863507,1,ruterochinchetera,12/07/2020,Terrible area. The motorhome pitches occupied by cars that go to the picnic area to make barbecues with the reggueton on full blast annoying everyone. Lots of rabble and drugs. Night party in the area until dawn and it has been impossible to sleep. Much insecurity to spend the night. Access to get there by very narrow roads does not fit Campervan and car together. Very difficult access. It is not worth spending the night here.

If you come from Santiago on the old road, it is highly recommended to go first to the Town Hall of Abegondo and from there look for the route to the reservoir. We went straight with Google Maps and ended up with the AC on a dirt road."

22920,280927,4,Masterlorob,05/07/2018,Nice place. It was raining heavily and we were happy to have a roof to cook. Unfortunately we had teenagers who disturbed us at night. They drove around in the big meadow with their car and their scooter. But certainly an exception here.
22920,246748,3,Toucanos,05/05/2018,Great location but a pity nothing was calculated to receive motorhomes; the services are present but difficult and there are no places to place themselves properly; in short we are never happy but it's really a shame.

22920,189457,2,AmandaRS,03/09/2017,There is a plague of mosquitoes at night so we had to go to spend the night somewhere else. In a moment that we left the door of the open AC they got close to about 20 or 30 of them that left us (especially my daughter) full of bites. A shame

After leaving the door open for only a few minutes (and with the light off inside) we ended up with dozens of mosquitoes in the camper. Suffice to say that what should have been a night of rest in a quiet place quickly turned into a nightmare ... In addition the toilets were closed and there was a big dog barking in the property directly opposite ... Too bad because otherwise, it is a very beautiful place. In short, good to make a stopover during the day but unless you are regulars of the Camargue do not think to spend the night ..."

22923,1934413,5,LuisLopezZeppe,31/05/2022,"Cool. Many sites would already like to have these services. Ideal if you go to Malpica or Caión, as was my case, since in A Coruña, except for payment, there is not much decent. You cannot spend the night (there is no space and traffic noise) but it gives you the essential service of filling and emptying gray and black water. chap!! and thanks to the town hall ☺️"
22923,1924042,4,SarahUK,28/05/2022,"We stopped here to rest and eat. There are picnic tables, BBQ stands and a bin. The area is under shade, so a pleasant place to stop. Next to a main road so not somewhere I'd choose to stop for a night. Area looks rarely used, so as another has noted, water might be stale. This area might be better listed as a picnic area - the signs don't indicate motorhome / campervan services - picnic only."

There is a larger carpark beside the restaurant on the drive in with more space if this is full. There were 4 motorhomes here when we arrived. It's not an Aire it's just a normal carpark so the parking is tight.
There is some shade and it got cool at night in early September.

We had 3 quiet nights and only had a single mosquito in the van which was quickly sorted. We were expecting more as there is a stagnant stream in front and we would have moved on if there had been as we react badly to them.

The Termas Chavasqueira free thermal pool is 5 minutes walk towards Ourense which is a must do/try activity. The Millennium and Roman bridges are 15/20 minutes walk away. Do the circuit of the Millennium bridge (you will know what I mean when you see it) for the views and to get a workout.
We did not get out the bikes but we're told there is a 15km circuit using both sides of the river.
Mercadona is a 25 minute walk away."

All warning is little."

22940,3272629,4,LinceNomada,08/09/2023,"A relatively quiet place. We have the cafeteria next door and since it is the only one in town, you can imagine the traffic of cars. The positive part that I see is the river and the showers to take a good bath. I have moved to Quiroga, which I like better, it is quieter and I have supermarkets and shops and a very nice walk along the banks of the Quiroga River"
22940,3196263,4,Serxan,21/08/2023,The place is beautiful. Better to spend the night in the picnic area below. With tables on the river walk. The area is difficult to park in the emptying zone. There is a tree and if cars park in front.

22940,2190895,4,eliseric,07/08/2022,3 or 4 places for camping car and plenty of other places next to it. Calm. Children's games just in front. River with small beach and shower just below. Restaurant. Sorting bins further up the road. Washing up faucet but it didn't work. Other faucets but not very convenient. Only real negative point: no toilets.

A pity that it only has 3 seats. Be careful with leaving at ""rush hour"" to the bathroom or restaurant, since cars are placed on both sides of the street and you cannot maneuver. I did not like using the same tap for poti and clean."

A couple of things: the cars park in front of the boxes reserved for AC and the unloading area, making maneuvering difficult. The second is that there is no separate tap to clean the toilet, this forces the filling tap to be disinfected before loading. In any case, thanks for this area."

The next day the town hall set up barriers to avoid wild parking. If a spot is full, go further. Those who act irresponsibly and disrespectfully cause these already few places to close"

I am amazed that such a small town has such an amazing place, apart from everything said, it also has a sink for not spend water from the car (other municipalities should take note) the only ""bad"" is that it only has 3 seats, although tonight came a fourth motorhome and proved to be a superior being as it stayed overnight until 11:00 the next morning in the water drainage zone. I don't give it 5 stars because the charging tap is the same as the poty's"

Tables and chairs in the nearby picnic area. A bar open in the evenings a few meters down the road with a riverside terrace. A stone’s throw from the river where you can sit or promenade. We weren’t bothered by road noise at all - I think reports of it being noisy are a bit harsh. Would happily stay again.

It is in the same town with all the services that it provides. The town has a lot of charm, with a very beautiful church and castle, and if you go into the streets you can see beautiful areas.

The town has its charm. I give it 4 stars because it seems to me that more places can be enabled in the same area. Thank you Castro Caldelas."
22942,2133348,3,Fran21,27/07/2022,Ideal site for unloading and loading water. Also to park and visit the town. We don't spend the night
22942,2096651,5,amainar,20/07/2022,Quiet and safe location in the same town. The town is beautiful and its surroundings are full of forests. There is a very nice route to the As Taboas recreational area where you can take a dip in the free pool and have a drink at the Chiringuito. A 10. Very good Castro Calderas.
22942,2096410,5,mimoss76,20/07/2022,"Quiet, all the services available and for free"
22942,2082921,3,tecnoceci,17/07/2022,"The area is fine but I do not recommend it at all if you go on weekends or parties because as the air goes in the direction of the area, from 1 at night the noise of the music from the disco/pub/terrace arrives and people shouting. Impossible to sleep."
22942,2054863,5,ramonruizd,09/07/2022,"A very cool town, alone in the motorhome area, very comfortable"
22942,1936252,1,AndreaKr,01/06/2022,"When filling up with water, suddenly a lot of dirt got into the filter and a worm about 20cm long. Luckily I had put the filter between the WoMo and my hose. Otherwise I would have wondered for the next few years why the water in the WoMo tasted like rotten worms"
22942,1933074,4,jonaskesh,31/05/2022,"area with minimal services, next to the town and quiet. Good place to stop. No shade though."
22942,1881662,5,silviapenachao,10/05/2022,thanks to the town hall for setting up an area for motorhomes and all the necessary services. Quiet area. Next to the town. Pichi area and park for children. There is no shade but you couldn't ask for more. Thank you.
22942,1851601,3,FerdiVan21,25/04/2022,A great place to stay. But wedges are needed because the parking areas are not level. There is a park next to the parking lot. Disposal and fresh water are free. The place is ok for an overnight stay. Thanks to the community
22942,1844445,4,pepedetui,21/04/2022,It is good to have places to stop and equipped with services but they could have it a little better since it is located in a town to visit and make a center to visit other nearby places and gives the feeling of being somewhat forgotten.
22942,1791014,5,CocoyGordy,21/03/2022,"Thank the council for the motorhome parking. Near the town, quiet place to sleep and spend the day there. Area with tables and trees, a park. Visiting the castle is worth it."

22942,1704160,4,jorconde,06/12/2021,"Pleasant area even though the services are not clearly visible, the WC if you don't look closely you won't notice, it is emptied on the road with white letters painted on the ground. do not download outside that area. let's be civic sometimes it may not be visible because of the leaves. comfortable place to visit one of the most beautiful villages in Spain."
22942,1580017,2,hipolito,15/09/2021,"It is not well leveled. To fill the water, the pressure of the hose is so low that you throw yourself away. So as if there was no service. The alleys around the castle are very beautiful but be careful especially if you travel with a dog because near the pharmacy there are two loose mastiffs walking through the town at their ease that practically threw us out of there since they were going to get ours. The people who saw it very uncivil without helping us or telling the owner to tie them up (despite both wearing a collar and greeting the neighbors between persecution and persecution of us, coincidentally no one knew who they were from ...) and that We were going with a baby. The visit awaited us."
22942,1570394,4,Bikerhd,12/09/2021,"Area very close to the town, not many motorhomes fit, it is easy to access and maneuver, it has services but I did not use them, there is a fountain and tables with benches, and right next to it a wooded area also with tables and benches and plenty of shade, only accessible on foot,"

22942,1326347,4,scsport,15/07/2021,"Quiet area, with picnic tables and playground. Very close to the town, where you can visit some things, such as its castle. The water loading area, a bit confusing, since a hatch has to be raised from the ground"
22942,1312892,4,uxa,11/07/2021,Quiet place to sleep. Picnic tables and emptying and filling services. The town is beautiful and its castle. I do not put 5 stars because the ground is not level and the children's area is broken and quite scarce.

22942,1157951,3,MicSimo,26/03/2021,"Very nice and quiet area in front of the children's park, 5 Min from the city castle even if when we were there it was closed for covid, too bad. The negative things however are that it is a bit sloping, the clean water comes out at low pressure but above all the toilet drain is a hole in the road so it makes it a bit difficult to clean it after it has been used."
22942,1144242,4,lescampingscoeurs,28/02/2021,"Very quiet area, close to the village center, castle, church. A little lady told us this morning: 'it is the most beautiful village in Spain !!!'"

22942,1120001,3,s-a-l-v-a,07/12/2020,"The area is not completely flat, but it is fine, to fill water the tap does not have a thread, and for sewage, in theory there is a cover on the ground but it cannot be opened."
22942,1090153,3,matachin,11/10/2020,5 minutes from the center of town. Well leveled. Thanks to the City Council for this area as there is no other in the area. to go to the village go up the stairs. Castle tickets 2 euros. Stunning views !! The faucet has no screw !! hence the three stars. with the wedges it levels perfectly.
22942,1048033,3,natimp,14/09/2020,"Sewage clogged, it only has 1 tap and of the 4 streetlights in the park, only 2 light up. It stays quiet, but needs maintenance of basic services."
22942,1037490,4,Hoodma,09/09/2020,"Very interesting area to spend a day, a town very close up stairs. The town is worth it, entrance to the Castle for 2 euros adults, children up to 10 years free. Very friendly people and charming place. One downside is that there is only one tap ... with what that implies. Thanks to the city council."

22942,963004,4,anpi,14/08/2020,"There are hardly any areas in the area so many thanks to the City Council for this beautiful area. the squares are quite spacious, that is why two places fit three motorhomes. A few meters away there are three supermarkets, a butcher, a fishmonger and several bars. The castle is worth it, only € 2. All VERY RECOMMENDED."
22942,961731,2,salolimu,14/08/2020,"Many people and few places. The parking markings are not respected, and if you are careless they leave you locked in or you cannot even open the doors."
22942,955895,4,satuco,12/08/2020,There is a threaded faucet next to the playground

22942,838903,4,jafaga,27/06/2020,Area with all services although the gray one is a very fine grid and the black one a hole in the ground to cover. We have been two days with a car and a karavana with wheels. It has no shade so if the sun hits you can get too hot.
22942,824167,5,maurocubela,14/06/2020,"Ideal. very well structured and next to the center with access by stairs. the town is small, but charming (narrow streets and a castle dominating the town). Full of cafes, and we just chose the one with the messy owner. perfect for spending a night with AC. large and somewhat uneven squares. Thanks to the city councils for these initiatives and to allow knowing Galicia."
22942,764140,5,salonbur,04/01/2020,"Free area, emptying and filling without problems. Today there is no one. Highly recommended, eating area and playground."
22942,751374,4,mpestana,08/12/2019,"We spent a quiet night. It was filled with vans, motor homes and a caravan. Near the town and with all the services for filling and water change."

22942,736899,4,Hugo_on_tour,02/11/2019,Very nice caravan parking at the edge of the village. Everything within walking distance. Water available.
22942,711542,4,convistasalmundoac,03/10/2019,"Eye, danger, danger someone has emptied the toilet in the trapdoor for clean water. The area is fine, very quiet at night, next to the town and everything is correct."
22942,678332,3,hwg,06/09/2019,"In itself a quiet place, however, there was in the evening a lot of children's noise from a playground within earshot, possibly from a school or kindergarten?"
22942,676300,4,padraigl,04/09/2019,"This Aire is a small carpark under the town dedicated to motorhomes with 8 parking spaces. The parking is not level and is lit up at night. There is no shade and not even a cooling breeze when we were there on 3rd September. So it got very hot in the motorhome 38 degrees. Night time got cool to sleep. We did have a mosquito in the van that we got rid of pretty quickly.
There is a childrens play area, concrete picnic benches and water fountain. To get to the town you go up the steps. In the morning about 7am a rooster across the road will wake you. Also there are bird bangers in the distance fields 24 hours a day. There is also a picnic area in the trees below the carpark with lots of small flies for company.

There are full services excluding electricity with no signage.
The grey waste is a normal ground drain with the grate missing and is just a large pipe in the ground.
The black WC drain is in the ground beside the grey drain with a small heavy cover that cannot be removed. I got out my toolbox and still could not remove it. The people who stayed before us put their black WC waste down the grey drain. It seems to be set up that way as it's just a bare drain pipe that suits the cassette. There is only 1 tap for fresh water and to clean the cassette. 
The fresh water tap is NOT screw-on and you need a rubber connection to push up on the tap, see picture. The pressure is weak and it's also a stiff push button.
There is a large bin in the carpark.

There are plenty of walks around the rolling hills and woods. We completed a lovely 15km walk, mainly in woodlands in 4hr30 with the only caveat of 100's of annoying small flies in the woods. They get in your ears, nose, mouth and eyes but do not bite.

There are plenty of cafe/restaurants in the town. There is even a castle that was closed when we visited. Fresh bread is widely available but no fresh milk in the town so bring plenty."
22942,619081,4,Pilarpartner,11/08/2019,Quiet place to spend a night. There is a fountain and the center of town is next door.
22942,594649,4,miguelmlajara,03/08/2019,"Excellent area to spend the night if you visit the Sil area. It has black and gray emptying and water filling services. We tried the shortbread Buca, and if you stop here you must try it."
22942,587709,4,thomasbreton35,31/07/2019,"Very quiet, easy access to 2 steps from the city center. All services. Rather flat. However early awakening by dogs and roosters who sing at sunrise. Do not arrive too late because places are expensive."

22942,538143,3,amicalement,04/07/2019,"Nothing to say about the parking spaces and the situation of the site but a pity that the emptying area is as badly conceived: a single tap without thread, for the evacuation of waste water, it is necessary to aim just!"
22942,529886,3,Perdi2xelmundo,26/06/2019,"The area is fine but unfortunately the lid to empty black could not be opened, it was stuck. And the tap to fill water did not have to be screwed, and it had to be tightening, so, impossible to refill water. I do not understand how an area for motorhomes can have these failures. Apart from this, do not leave this town without buying a shortbread in O Forno. It is very good !!"
22942,517543,5,CuniOrge,16/06/2019,"Perfect, except that the squares are not level. Easy access, services, quiet and, climbing some stairs, you are in the center of town. The town is not bad. It is like a huge viewpoint and has a small historical center, but beautiful. Warning, the bakery on the main street, a robbery: € 2.50 a normal dumpling!"
22942,444238,4,Polillos,24/03/2019,Great .. The light of a nearby park ... a little complicated the emptying .. the rest great .... a staircase and you are in the center of the beautiful town.

22942,438080,5,anaygua,09/03/2019,"Overnight 4/3/19. Very quiet area next to a park. If you come back from the village at night, a flashlight is recommended to go down the stairs.

22942,395928,4,Angelet,19/10/2018,"We visit it in passing to eat in the city, located in the lower part of the town but you go up some stairs. On Thursday there is a market and they make octopus in the streets to eat inside the bars. The octopus is off in the mouth, buenisimo !!!!!"
22942,307514,3,pamesto,30/07/2018,"Good location a few meters from the town. Maintenance is missing: there is no connection to plug mangera, the sewage is badly indicated and the day we were the papelerras to overflow with shit."
22942,269150,3,n0e,15/06/2018,"Wide and well located site for a very interesting visit. But the water tap is a source, without any thread or adapter that is worth to load water. There is a gray water trench but there is no indication for sewage: an overflowing pit?"

22942,217703,5,agiz3,05/01/2018,"We have been a few weeks ago. Comfortable one step from the town, bars and shops. Well lit at night, gave us security although the area is very quiet and in itself. If it is cold at night, in the morning the tap will be frozen, so I recommend loading water from day to winter. The parking spaces have a slight slope."

Playground, picnic tables, large plots, water and black water station (almost exclusive, since it is always intended for two campers)... The site is very well maintained and has a beautiful view of the mountains. Top!"
22944,2913959,1,capitanpanceta,02/07/2023,"The bad thing about this area is that there is no possibility of emptying the grays and people come to empty them on the ground because in Viveiro there is a rock concert and there are more than 200 AC and the emptying of grays is practically impossible. There is a sign here that says that it is a natural park and that it indicates dumping of grays and there is no such place, they have the wrong sign. A focus of infections, I will not return again."

This morning together with an employee of the municipality we prepared the hookup for the water which was not good before! There is NO drain on the ground, there is only one in the column, so you have to use a basin to drain the water."

To improve the water filling taps, too wide and without thread; It can be filled from an alternative source but a lot of hose has to be flushed.

22954,2743797,2,Lusanfer,12/05/2023,"Very disappointing area, very neglected. The environment is good, the recreational area and the pool when it is open, but now the area dedicated to the cars is not maintained at all."
22954,2723275,3,KateMead,04/05/2023,"it's true in early May it is somewhat abandoned and the ground has been made uneven by wild boar, but the services do work and are accessible. its quiet, the view is pretty good and the area is stunning. lovely circular walk from the parking space.... so to be able to stay overnight in this area... could be worse. maybe if more people stayed again, they would smarten it up again?"
22954,2513909,2,JMigAlz,05/12/2022,Totally neglected area.
22954,2044447,2,BarAldan,06/07/2022,A very nice view. Area very well in 2018. Now the area is not maintained and is used as a dump for dirt trucks which also break up the ground. To forget too bad.
22954,1944731,5,Jaimerg,04/06/2022,"Excellent site, surrounded by nature and good complementary facilities, including a swimming pool in the summer. The nearby restaurant is great. Thanks to the Illano City Council"
22954,1754027,5,PelayoAlvarez,12/02/2022,Highly recommended area with everything you need to spend a few quiet days in the middle of nature. The pool that is next to the area looks to be beastly! Thanks to the town hall and the people of Illano for this area.
22954,1671236,5,RAKELPIKO78,31/10/2021,"Area with excellent views, all services except electricity. Countless hiking trails in the area. We didn't go to the restaurant next door, but because of the cars in the parking lot... I don't think it was bad. We will return without a doubt."
22954,1639279,5,Kerowynn,11/10/2021,"Thank you for sharing. The restaurant closed on October 10, we were alone apart from a few walkers. Very peaceful, some quite sporty hikes to do (lots of elevation gain), a nice view, and functional and clean services. What happiness."
22954,1538618,5,viano13,01/09/2021,"AC area with fountain. There are fabulous municipal swimming pools (€ 2), with a picnic area and BBQ. The bar / restaurant with atmosphere! Very nice views and very quiet area. Ideal for families!"
22954,1482666,5,Mardano,19/08/2021,"The area has good views. and a restaurant where the menu is scary because of the quantity. I didn't ask for canes, so they couldn't charge me separately, but just for the amount of food they herded I would have gladly paid for them. The area falls out of hand for me to come regularly but I would return. Municipal swimming pool without prohibition of access to outsiders in Covid era"
22954,1471505,1,Toroblanco,17/08/2021,"The only thing the area has are views. The restaurant leaves a lot to be desired, something with great expectations come to less, the food is not bad but we asked for the € 10 menu and they charged us € 4 extra for two canes without warning, for not entering the menu, even if we had asked no other drink. The least is to say it before. Thanks for the area but you won't see us around here again."
22954,1467004,5,Daglan,16/08/2021,"Beautiful views, beware that it is two kilometers before the town and it is easy to pass, the area sign is not well seen. The restaurant and the swimming pool are closed on Mondays."
22954,1455562,5,InigoFS,14/08/2021,"Highly recommended. As always, people with tables and chairs outside the AC, even with the barbecue, with tables and free-use barbecues a few meters away. Shameful."
22954,1408035,5,nouveauvoyageurinconnu,05/08/2021,"A magical spot, the view is superb and the almost flat land with a pool and a super plentiful restaurant. the top"

22954,1364942,5,cimadevilla2020,25/07/2021,"Excellent site and environment, well cared for, the pool near super cheap price, with drinking water, flat land without the need for a wedge."
22954,1264854,5,franjgr,19/06/2021,"For my perfect taste, a motorhome area, a recreational area, a restaurant where you can eat very well, a soccer field, children's games, a swimming pool in summer and a starting point for hiking routes. The only negative point, the road to get to Illano is third world, but that can no longer be solved by the city council"
22954,1208286,5,hastaluegoanda,20/05/2021,"Great views, level and very quiet, the pity is that everything is still closed, but recommended for the summer and with the pool open"

22954,1162322,5,Dubardo,31/03/2021,"Spectacular place. Possibility of loading and unloading. Beautiful views, environment with wide possibilities for sports, hiking, playground, restaurant with very friendly staff and good quality. Night of the 29th and 30th in the company of several vans. The Suspension Bridge Route is highly recommended."
22954,1118695,5,yoemilio,01/12/2020,"A 10 for Illano. Let's see if other municipalities take note. Not only for our collective but also for the inhabitants themselves. Lovely place for parties, gatherings, celebrations, picnic. In short Great! He does not lack anything! Every self-respecting town deserves such an area!"
22954,873124,3,park4night6694,16/07/2020,"Bad siti ideal for the 3 ac party, the place is beautiful but it is spoiled by all those people, drinks and something else, music to everything it gives and the police have no idea."

22954,712015,4,jojohinz,03/10/2019,"Nice, quiet parking space. We were at the end of September for 2 nights and completely alone. A toilet was open but the flush was broken."
22954,613018,5,RoadcarOtto,09/08/2019,Great pitch with beautiful views. The tickets for the swimming pool have to be bought in the bar and there are toilets behind the swimming pool.
22954,425944,5,travelbug2018,01/02/2019,Came across just driving along this road stunning route.  off season so here all by ourselves.  lovely setting and peaceful. water and waste emptying available but toilets closed off season. perfect  base for hiking round the area.

22955,3247647,1,lolaida,01/09/2023,"Wasted area, it's a shame that we don't get more out of it by having that Trial center next door with bathrooms, cafeteria, bungalow... and everything was closed. We spent a night alone. You can hear dogs barking, people passing by, truck traffic and an ambulance that came to unload water with the music blaring at dawn. The seats are inclined and do not allow chocks to be removed. We left very disappointed."
22955,3184477,1,AET66,20/08/2023,"Nice town but the area is badly located! Still, thanks to the municipality for the initiative."
22955,2874144,5,Joserram,20/06/2023,"Magnificent site in the middle of Nature, the area has all the services and comfort in the squares. Comfortable and problem-free loading and unloading area. The area of the stay is flat and very clean with diagonal parking spaces. Hiking trails. In the parking lot in front (Trial circuit area) there is current in the poles."
22955,2740983,4,Foska,11/05/2023,It is a very quiet place with beautiful views. We parked in the parking area of the trial area until we realized by looking at the maps that the area was in front on the grassy area next to the river rail. Although the emptying and filling area is in the parking lot. There is a light socket in the trial area but we only use it to charge mobile phones faster.
22955,2734122,5,Oskii13,08/05/2023,"It has everything in a quiet place and a beautiful setting. We stayed 2 nights and it was super good, the second one plugged in the light, which was also free. Near the river. The town is very cool too."

22955,2460984,5,DaniiFernandez,25/10/2022,"We had a great night and a very quiet place. It is next to a trial motorcycle circuit that is very cool. The views are beautiful and the place is very well kept. It has a power outlet and gray water drain, although I don't know if they work because we didn't test it. People in the town are very nice. I would repeat without a doubt."
22955,2344704,5,RaquelVolkova,06/09/2022,"Excellent service area. The black and gray water drain is located on the right wall as you enter. It is not signposted so if you do not know it, it is difficult to find it. To fill the water we went right in front of the grassy area where you will find some taps on the ground and thus avoid filling the clean water from the same place where the poti is cleaned."
22955,2292855,5,RamFerTo,24/08/2022,"We have spent the night of 08/22 in the most absolute calm and solitude. Total peace, only interrupted by the sound of the river. It is a perfect area to disconnect and rest (as long as there are no trial tests). It has all the services working perfectly, a playground in front and a fabulous setting between mountains. Thanks to the municipality of Igüeña for providing us with these services."
22955,2265546,5,Kitty_goda,19/08/2022,"We spent the night here, it's a very quiet place. Black water can be emptied."
22955,1950330,5,Dalakker,05/06/2022,"We stood here two very quiet nights. There is free drinking water and the possibility of disposing of gray water and emptying the toilet cassette. You should call for electricity but we didn't need it. The pitches are on the river side! We e-biked to Colinas del Campo de Martin Moro Tolado, a beautiful old village. Pobladura has a small pub."
22955,1764387,5,femke22,24/02/2022,Super parking space to stay overnight. We spent a quiet night there. Large spacious places
22955,1638153,4,khorne,11/10/2021,"This is a large site next to a motocross site.   During the day there is some noise from the motorcycles and also cars in the shared car park, but this is not a problem.   On a night there are few people around but it is very noisy with barking dogs.  Barking dogs seem to be a national problem in Spain and in this village there are several sets who take turns during the night.   But the dogs are far enough away that we could sleep ok.   There black and grey emptying is good but there is only one tap which people use having just handled the black water, so it needs a good clean each time."
22955,1204313,3,patryjavi,17/05/2021,"The area and the basic services it has is appreciated. They are on the wall to the right as you enter, it is not indicated anywhere. I do not understand why the car cannot be fitted, if it is a safety element in the end. There is a hiking trail next door."
22955,1171060,3,Rapera86,09/04/2021,"Quiet place to spend a night, several booths with water and electricity with padlock, but the rest with open doors. The only bad thing that they do not allow to put chocks and it has a slight slope"

22955,1118259,4,Burgaillo,28/11/2020,"Contrary to what they say, electricity has a padlock and is not accessible. Slightly inclined squares but a good place for a night pass."
22955,1108978,4,kentnhobbs,29/10/2020,"Nice place to stop, not hugely interesting but great for a night stop. The water wasn’t working at this time, sure it was an anomaly though."
22955,1092747,3,KodyBilbo,13/10/2020,"Quiet and free place between mountains. There are several buildings for the Trial, but there are no good indications of what each thing is. We arrived at night and we were looking for the toilets from hut to hut until confirming that they were closed, we suppose because of Covid. Some photos that have been added may be misleading, there are no panoramic views."

22980,3196259,5,llserrano,21/08/2023,"Free electricity, dirty cleaning services and WC. Also refills water but the same hose as to clean the WC. Perfect to start mountain routes"
22980,3104246,3,carsanlo,08/08/2023,Good area but uneven and used by cars going to the pilgrim hospital or the interpretation center. They should put up an exclusivity sign for motorhomes if they don't want them to park in the center.
22980,3100659,4,PakitoCalvo,08/08/2023,"Quiet area at the foot of the Sierra de Aizkorri. All free water loading and unloading services.

Thanks to the City Council for keeping this area operational."

22980,3003976,5,karpets,22/07/2023,"A cool site. Few places. Although it is at a height, there is an elevator that takes you down to the bottom. Need for wedges because it has some slope. Surrounded by green."
22980,2984567,4,Albert-PM,18/07/2023,"Good area, quiet, uneven, with the services described now there is a hospital for pilgrims on the Camino de Sant Jaume next to it.

22980,2535765,4,rollanderic,31/12/2022,"Thank you to the municipality for this very nice area, electricity, water, black and gray drainage. The village is lower, and the icing on the cake is a lift next to the area to descend quickly. and the TV works really well for one or more nights."
22980,2507131,4,fsbalma,27/11/2022,"Area very well connected to the town center by elevator. The car park has an inclination so you will need wedges to park, it also has an area for filling water and emptying gray water. In the immediate vicinity many routes to discover."

22980,1505838,4,sofi-a,24/08/2021,"The place is very good to spend the night and spend a pleasant day near routes ... the only thing is the overcrowding, also because of the bad conscience of the people ... we are 4 AC with our camper that is of great volume in the small squares and the camper, even tourism (they sleep inside with everything outside) in the big squares ... For the rest, thanks to the town of Zegama for this area"

22980,1440048,5,onti,11/08/2021,There are four places enabled for motorhomes and five for vans or cars. It’s a bit fair for motorhomes and it’s steep. There are no toilets in the area but there are public toilets in the village. Electricity is free. There is a coin machine but it didn't work. It is next to a green area ideal for resting and eating. We really liked it!
22980,1431700,4,mariagalan,09/08/2021,"Very good area, super quiet. for filling and emptying and with a shady park next to it. You can also do the zegama trail route, it is beautiful. With an elevator, you reach the center of town in no time. with the hose, we sleep level."
22980,1420139,3,bruno0704,07/08/2021,Only for small camper vans or vans. Narrow and very steep access road. The locations correspond to those of a car park. We had to maneuver several times to get out and ended up going to a parking lot in town.
22980,1387183,3,calichy,31/07/2021,Quiet place. We have eaten. We planned to stay overnight but it has a lot to do. Anyway very nice place to eat. Thanks to the city council.
22980,1329445,5,Aeren,16/07/2021,Very nice area. The following Monday no one can be parked due to a concert. Starting point for many hiking trails.
22980,1305694,2,RikarNoodles,08/07/2021,"An area too steep, impossible to level even with chocks. It is more like a parking lot where you can wait if someone is draining than a place to spend the night. we had to go to one of the streets of the town, much flatter than the area itself."
22980,1283040,3,laspescadillasviajeras,28/06/2021,Very steep area almost impossible to sleep. The other services in perfect condition and clean. Very small area with few places. Maneuvering if the area is full is quite difficult depending on the length of your vehicle.
22980,1281909,3,laspescadillasviajeras,27/06/2021,It has a lot of inclination. Otherwise a beautiful area with clean and perfect services.
22980,1272349,5,LaFurgui,23/06/2021,"AC area perfect for spending the night, seeing the village and enjoying the mountains. No services, only garbage collection and water area. It is very quiet and very beautiful. The lift takes you to the center of town in 2min. The tourist office is in the car park itself (dmc-dmg from 10am to 2pm). From there there are very well signposted hiking trails. Small area for children 1min. Perfect."
22980,1269886,5,ruta21,22/06/2021,"Very quiet and clean place. We have spent the night. Electric socket available for a fee. Of course, parking with a lot of slope still and put chocks. Thanks to the Zegama city council for these facilities."
22980,1257346,3,lasarastark,15/06/2021,"We do not stay because without chocks it is impossible to be too inclined. a shame because the area is very beautiful. only the last photo is current, now there is an interpretation center in the countryside and it is no longer as ""natural"" as seen in the first photos"
22980,1255149,4,Carlos_Dulce,14/06/2021,"Quiet area with water and free dumps, however you need to use wedges because it has some inclination. Elevator to go to the village right in front of the area."
22980,1203040,5,JulenHDM,16/05/2021,A very cool area from which to climb the Aizkorri.
22980,1181754,3,edgarquiroule,29/04/2021,A building has been built so there is no longer a view. The places are sloping and the wedges are not enough to be straight. It is very quiet and there is a green area with benches just behind.
22980,1169045,3,tania22,06/04/2021,"We have been Saturday Sunday and Monday. Very quiet area, super friendly townspeople. There is no electricity because people take the tokens to other sites so the city council has it disabled. Otherwise great."
22980,1162152,5,gudatxori,31/03/2021,"Great place. In the quiet outside the village, but at the same time the possibility to go down to the village by lift (and supermarket). There are many hiking trails. Few and narrow squares, yes."
22980,1158392,4,sunnybird,27/03/2021,The location is beautiful. Fairly flat and we were alone. But at the end of the day we were between 10 campers while there is room for 4. Then not as it should be found.
22980,1132603,5,fragoclever,23/01/2021,"Good AC, quiet place for about 11 motorhomes, mandatory use of chocks. It is located next to a beautiful wood museum (€ 1 entry). Good access to the town, by elevator. Zegama is worth a visit."
22980,1124905,5,rosbarsou,28/12/2020,Quiet place with an elevator to go down to the town. A good place to start routes. The first photo is outdated. Now there is a building in front like in the last photo.
22980,1114198,3,richywhl,10/11/2020,"Bit disappointed, went for the relaxing view shown in first picture, but a building is now there! The other side has large leylandii trees growing so it feels rather enclosed. Facilities ok but I think a token is needed for the electric. Didn’t stay, moved on, as we wanted a view. Thanks to the town for the facility though."
22980,1100324,4,nuketown,20/10/2020,"Perfect for sleeping after the climb to the aizkorri (it is 15 min from the parking lot of the climb) during the night we were 7 motorhomes so it has more space than what the place marks, next to a quiet park and also with the beginning of routes from there, to get to pay attention to the traffic signs that mark the area perfectly. Very good views."
22980,1098959,4,Regina65,19/10/2020,Actually a great place that would get one more star. The problem is that the locals wash their cars at the supply and disposal station and don't see the need to make room.
22980,1096533,3,Neku,17/10/2020,Very quiet. Many hiking trails start from there. Elevator to go to town.
22980,1060149,5,Ducatovanfym,20/09/2020,"Place with all services, emptying of gray and black water (a hatch next to the source) and filled with water with a hose. Everything quite new, it depends on where the GPS sends you there is a very steep and quite narrow slope that is a cut street, you have to go around it and you get there without complications. We put wedges to level."
22980,988853,5,sazy79,21/08/2020,Perfect parking!
22980,953726,4,isiseric,12/08/2020,Comfortable and quiet place lighting at night there are no bathrooms but there is water and electricity. it is next to a cemetery
22980,947541,4,xemita,10/08/2020,The car parks are sloping. there is light connection that worked for us without plugging in. Perfect place to visit Zegama and go hiking in the area

22980,934962,4,goossens59@gmail.com,07/08/2020,"Walk next to the park, water and electricity. Be careful, the bell tower rings even at night."
22980,919395,5,grandourse,01/08/2020,Good place to plug in. There's a clean toilet located 5min walk into town. Busy on a Saturday night. There's also some trail running tracks right next to the park.
22980,914276,5,hmorillo,31/07/2020,Very pleasant with the possibility of discharging water and filling. A very large and clean picnic area next to the parking area. A bit inclined but highly recommended. It has the possibility of an electrical outlet.
22980,890051,4,GemmaMQ,22/07/2020,"Good area of ACs, with loading and unloading of gray and black water. The access a bit inclined, but we with a 7m AC climbed well. The parking lot is inclined, but with falcas it can be leveled without problem. Very beautiful environment. Very very calm. We liked a lot. With possibilities of routes on foot and by bike. H"
22980,873345,4,ParkStar,16/07/2020,Thanks to the Zegama city council. Excellent environment and walking routes that start from the adjacent meadow. You go down to town by elevator. We have had a wonderful lunch at Ostatu Zegama. The squares a little inclined and we have AC footwear
22980,800496,3,fred.voyage,03/05/2020,"Many thanks to the community for setting up the place. Stand there in transit last night. Unfortunately, however, both the squares and the disposal station are with a steep gradient. It is difficult to empty the gray water tank and the fresh water tank full. When parking my 7.4m mobile was too long for the marked places and even at the highest level of the wedges my mobile was still very sloping. Since nobody else was there, I stood across and just got the mobile at the highest level. It was quiet at night except for a few dogs. There is now a building behind the parking spaces on the meadow (old photos)."
22980,781871,4,jasogui,17/02/2020,Very good area with water and electricity. In a quiet place and origin of many routes. Slightly inclined.
22980,780856,5,jlabeille,15/02/2020,"Nice place in a small place. Although we were absolutely out of season, the space in the evening filled up with lots of motorhomes. In the evening you have a great view of the small town."
22980,768291,4,MinTerrier,13/01/2020,Good for 1 or 2 nights
22980,716531,4,adrianamns,08/10/2019,"The site is small, and in what was the pretty grass esplanade they have built a building, so now the parking lot is embedded between buildings and loses charm. There is electricity paying € 3 for a card that can be purchased in the village, in an inn. There is only one Eroski (small supermarket), beautiful surroundings."
22980,713527,3,Iker1979,05/10/2019,"At date 5_10_2019, they are under construction in front, there is no light, if there is discharge and filling, quiet place to sleep"
22980,700710,3,JuanyAinhoa,22/09/2019,"Currently under construction. The grays are not completely emptied by tilting the ground, a hose for everything. Thanks anyway to the city of Zegama ....."

22980,668233,4,Genedan,30/08/2019,Beautiful site and very quiet. Park next to which routes to walk. Only four places and when we were two occupied by works. It seems they are expanding. There is a supermarket and shops nearby. Water loading and unloading. The electricity very expensive.
22980,621957,5,isabelgaror,12/08/2019,Recommendable!! A quiet place and a beautiful landscape.
22980,605945,4,Viajeros3,07/08/2019,"Very good area and very complete, extremely quiet, only missing seats, 4 are few."
22980,480005,4,DaPads19,09/05/2019,Lovely parking area just above the town and right next door to the interpretation centre for the park. Very quiet overnight. You can walk straight from the parking into the hills. And there's loads of trail running routes too. There's only four bays so it may get busy during the summer. Access via a steep road with a sharp bend. However HGVs (refuse truck) made it up here no problem.
22980,475499,5,elmundoconpeques,04/05/2019,"Quiet area at the foot of the Sierra de Aizkorri. Next to the interpretation center. Many info of the area that really worth it. All free water loading and unloading services. We corrected the partner, yes there are garbage containers in the area itself."
22980,469009,2,lanegrita,27/04/2019,"To buy the chips for electricity, at the tourist office right there but close at 2pm you have to go down to the bar Txanton village 3 € 2 hours, there are no containers for garbage and those that are 50 meters away are closed with key for the neighbors."
22980,468457,2,lanegrita,26/04/2019,"Free charge and download service, on the other hand electricity seems expensive 3 € 2 hours"
22980,449232,4,anaygua,05/04/2019,"(30/3/19) Ideal environment for hiking. The access to the village through the elevator is very comfortable. Slanted seats, with chocks solved. Loading and unloading of water without problems. Thank you very much to the town hall."
22980,412966,3,Vely,09/12/2018,"Very nice environment, if you like hiking there are very cool routes. Empty gray and black. The light cost us 3 euros 2 hours and we took chips at the tourist office right next. Necessary chocks. Passage for elevator that goes down to the village."
22980,403254,5,ElJose,02/11/2018,"Everything ok, the only thing a little inclined. Thanks to the municipality of Zegama."

22980,368058,3,pansorena,08/09/2018,A good place to visit the town and the surroundings. The area has enough to carry out the services of the motorhome and overnight.
22980,338127,4,rocinante,16/08/2018,"area with all services. It has a hose, but you can change it for yours, for, clean waters. fair but sufficient spaces. Lovely setting and the elevator for the purchase is a point. they are emptied gray and black without problems. the place of everything is perfectly seen. squares in solvable slope with chocks that for that they are."
22980,311808,4,miguelfranco2,02/08/2018,These places are very much appreciated. Big chocks are necessary. Ideal if you like to run and walk through the bush.
22980,303544,3,padraigl,27/07/2018,"The 4 spaces are not level. We used our chokes and still not level but ok for shower drain and sleeping. They are also very close together. It suits the smaller van really.
The satnav might try to send you up a narrow road but just follow the signs.

The services are on a hill. The grey did not empty fully. There is one tap with a hose attached that is sitting on the toilet grate. We drink our fresh tank water and are fastidious about cleanliness. Because if our fresh water tank is contaminated, we are sick and the tank will need to be cleaned. Yes we wipe everything down and of course we don't have to take the water from here but when it advertised as a service area this would be close to a 2 star just for that reason. 

Saying all that if like us, you are into the walking this is a perfect area. You could also try Onati/Arantzazu across the valley.
We completed PR GI 3009 in 5.30hrs. Just follow the signs. It's similar to number 10 on map from tourist office. It's a fantastic walk. It's mainly in forest. Bring a stick as some of the track in the last part is full of nettles. 

There is a dog that barks late into the evening and the church bell ringing every hour but we slept well as we are used to these noises from our town.

The town had plenty of cafe/bars. Supermarket is 2mins down the lift. It's not a vibrant town, more sleepy.

There are people walking their dogs and not picking up the poo. The grass had loads of dog poo."
22980,301812,2,Webkayaker,26/07/2018,"The indications of google maps are wrong and lead to a point without exit, eye! Squares in slope, few and narrow. Nice environment and information center with very friendly staff. Meritorious initiative."

22980,284366,3,Fran4,09/07/2018,"Area next to the Natural Park, with beautiful views of the mountains. There are only 4 places for motor homes, the rest are for cars. The squares are quite inclined. It is next to the cemetery. You can not empty gray water, from the information center next to it, they told us that you can not empty the gray or black, just fill water."

In my opinion places are too big, since it is an area for motorhomes and not a campsite to take out tables, awnings, chairs, have gatherings bothering others, etc. (Then we complain, but a few unpresentable splatter us all). Thank you Grau / Grado."

23029,2755679,2,ManilaTao,16/05/2023,The only reason to go there is having kids AND an ACSI Card. Then it’s 23€/Night and your family has a good time. Otherwise don’t go there. We booked a standard spot online and got the difference from the ACSI price back. But I guess it was pure luck. We met a couple of people who where forced to take a Comfort Spot even the standard Spots were 1/3 full. „A group is coming“ is what they tell.
23029,2755083,3,schnabelewopski,16/05/2023,"Important: it is primarily not a campsite, but a bungalow park with a few pitches. The standard pitches are a bit off the beaten path and overpriced without ACSI (€45 per night with a child). Positive: sanitary facilities clean and a great swimming pool and extensive children's program. Conclusion: to be recommended with children and ACSI, otherwise rather not."
23029,2729038,2,janoderso,06/05/2023,"Place nice but too expensive. Very unequal treatment. Most people are told that there are only comfort pitches (108€/2 nights!), then others come and get a standard pitch. Half of these were free after several people at the reception said there weren't any more. ACSI only works with standard. Nice pool for children, nice entertainment but quality does not correspond to the enormously high price in NS."

In the end the restaurant was closed and opened for the season 4 days later, the laundry was under construction! We were with a baby and we had nothing to eat in the evening, so we left to look for a laundromat for the baby's clothes. And I'm not talking to you about the pet friendly at 6€ a day you surprise me?. In short, with a van and a dog for 2 nights, how much did it cost us? 102€!!! It was our little luxury for the evening of my 40th birthday, as much to say that it didn't make us that happy..."
23029,2620303,3,Lebensglück,22/03/2023,"All the necessary utilities are available, the site is mostly set up with rental accommodation. Very nice and friendly reception. Very clean and heated sanitary facilities. Well suited for children."

23029,2516233,5,secret03,08/12/2022,"A very nice resort. There are 3 pools, two of which are covered. All are warm. There is a game room with billiards etc. There is also a great gym. The pitches are good and the sanitary building is clean. You can also wash. The staff are friendly and helpful."
23029,2485809,5,JLPicard,06/11/2022,Camping and bungalow park with swimming pool. The pitches are at ground level and free to choose in November. Ideal starting point for visiting the north beach of Nazare. The sanitary facilities are clean and up to standard. Reception speaks several languages and is very friendly. Ideal for children because of the many games and sports. Main street is a bit noisy.
23029,2421805,4,anniedid,03/10/2022,please note this campsite closes from 5 to 16 oct 2022 for an event at their place.. we enjoyed 2 days 25 euros / day on a comfort pitch with acsi cc and elec 2 pers. if standard pitch = along a busy road €20.

23029,2133932,4,anywaypul,28/07/2022,"Paradise for children! Outdoor and aquatic slides, covered swimming pool, another heated one, a room with consoles… in short, fun! It is therefore more expensive (80e a night for the upper pitch - very wide and well placed). Very busy in summer remember to book."
23029,2080663,4,MarcisYSira,16/07/2022,"The campsite is very good. the pools are very good, especially the ones that have hot water when it's cold outside. fails in that it does not have a store and that the lifeguards are often absent from their site, if there is a dangerous situation there would be no one to watch"
23029,2074199,5,charlyexposito,14/07/2022,"Camping with many facilities and activities focused on children. All the time they have activities, normal park mats and water parks at their disposal. The campsite itself is very good with toilets and showers nearby, the plots are good and surrounded by pine trees so they usually have shade, all of them with electricity and water. High price but we knew where we were going"
23029,2055165,5,Maleka1412,09/07/2022,"It is a very spacious campsite, with bungalows, glamping and pitches for caravans. They have two types of pitches for caravans, but all with electricity, water, bathrooms / showers nearby. The best thing is their approach for children. Several swimming pools, facilities and events designed for them. The only thing too strict are the meal times: from 8:30 to 10:30 for breakfast, 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. for lunch and from 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. for dinner."
23029,2049537,2,xwp1971,08/07/2022,"This is a resort with lots of facilities, especially for children. Horrible area for motorhomes. Right next to busy road, noise night and day. Very clean, but you would expect that at that price. Nazaré is a great village and beach. Best food we have had in Portugal."
23029,1997882,5,Coufrey,21/06/2022,"Well-appointed campsite with lots of activities for young and old. The indoor swimming pool is a real asset, as well as the swimming pool containers, fitness room and fun zone. Van location large and slightly out of the way, clean sanitary facilities."
23029,1933817,5,Crafter2014,31/05/2022,A very nice area with indoor and outdoor pool with water slide. Perfect for children. There are not many parking spaces. 12 pitches that are a bit bigger and 15 smaller ones that are 5 € cheaper. We paid 34€ with 2 adults 1 child for a large place.
23029,1871337,4,Stiff,05/05/2022,"First of all, it should be said that this is an outdoor resort that offers campsites and not a camping resort. Accordingly, the parking spaces are housed on site. The standard pitches are right on the busy main road. The sanitary facilities are good. There are several pools (also covered), playgrounds, lounges, a gym and restaurant."

23029,1631256,3,InesVicencio,07/10/2021,"Although it has good facilities, it has little to do with a campsite. The only area available to stay was along a road with a lot of noise."
23029,1608667,4,Ibarra,26/09/2021,"Probably one of the best in Portugal to go with the family. Everything is correct, including the quality / price ratio. There is a bus that stops you at the door and goes down to Nazaré."

With the ACSI card € 18 for 2 people, van and electric motorbike, but you are no longer in the campsite but away on the side of the very busy road. Number of places limited. Very disappointed !!!!"
23029,1583099,5,fmorice,16/09/2021,"Very good campsite with a very pleasant welcome in French. Pleasant pitches with very clean sanitary facilities reserved for camper van pitches. beautiful facilities, swimming pools, gym, games room, wellness area, bus leaving the campsite."
23029,1558726,2,Popppotz,08/09/2021,"The campsite is now called OHAI. A proud price of 58 € for what is on offer. The parking space was large and with water and electricity, but the sanitary facilities were outdated. There is a lot on offer for children (pool, supervision, playhouse), fitness room available and ok. But the price-performance ratio is simply not right. After Nazare approx. 40 minutes on foot"
23029,1529333,4,ANTERO,29/08/2021,"Ideal for families, somewhat high price if you only come to spend the night, for us who spent the whole day at the correct price since we made use of all its facilities (playground, gym, swimming pools, restaurant and children's activity areas) somewhat narrow parking spaces for a large volume camper."
23029,1437545,3,Culogordo,11/08/2021,"Good: very good treatment, very clean and new bathrooms, swimming pool. Ideal for the little ones.

There is also a reading and TV room and next to a pool table with drinks machine, nicely decorated. Here and there could be something rehabilitated. Nazaré is easy to reach. Overall a good campsite."

It’s a Volkswagen caddy, short model, everywhere we been they been counting it as a car, but here we had to pay as if it was a caravan!!! We had to pay for electricity and everything even though we don’t need it. If we would have said we had a tent it would have been cheaper even though we take less space than a car and a tent. Other than that is nice and clean but really, 33 € for two persons and a car in September, not worth it."
23029,661282,4,Radiio2,26/08/2019,"Large and shaded plots. They allow you to choose the plot if the one you like is free and each plot has its electricity point. It has a large pool and a children's pool, both are good. The only downside, the bathrooms. No lid on the water and complicated showers to graduate hot water. The mouth of water filling is fat. Good atmosphere in general, friendly staff and everything ok."

23029,495085,3,rol54,28/05/2019,"A bit expensive compared to the benefits. Good for one night, May 12th, but a lot of time spent at the front desk that was overflowing, and having chosen a location, wanted us to change because it was supposedly booked. By cons unconscious barbecuing with flames in the evening, under the pines, with plenty of needles on the ground, without the guards or staff say nothing."
23029,485683,2,Gretchen,16/05/2019,"Unfortunately, I can not entirely agree with the consistently good comments. The place is ok for a visit from Nazare. We explored the viewpoint and the city by ebike, it is very mountainous. The pool was not available due to renovation. Toilets and showers were partly broken. The playground is a disaster (there are nails out). Reception friendly."

There are different sized pitches, power with the three-pin blue plugs - no adapter needed The wash house is clean, no toilet paper, showers with pressure switch, temperature could not be adjusted. Maybe we did not get it, turn on the pressure switch did not work. To Nazaré it is two km along the road. Dogs are allowed, you need the ID card (vaccination card) the information was now occupied for a very long time in January, at nine o'clock was still someone there. Departure is until twelve which is also very fair."

We were woken up at 5 in the morning by a group of guys who came by for the evening ... Maybe we were just unlucky. Planes that go by quite noisy all the time. No service."

The view is very beautiful on the small village of Olivella, which is accessible on foot from the car park for a very pleasant visit to this peaceful village. Very clean toilets in the village and fountain. It is also possible to take a very nice hike around Olivella: ""el castel bel""."
23044,1919599,3,Sjany,27/05/2022,"Flat site, with plenty of shade. The ruins are really not worth it: two dilapidated houses with a fence around them and a lot of dog poo around them. The place itself smells quite like urine. The bushes are frequently used for 'a big message'. A lot of waste. We did not sleep there, no view and the stench stopped us."
23044,1914672,5,angeljo,25/05/2022,"I slept there one weekend night, in low season (May). Very quiet place, limited parking spaces. Shade in the morning. Very quiet place, only a car passed by on the forest track. Perfect for bike or walking routes. In the middle of the Garraf natural park. A few kilometers from the Buddhist monastery."
23044,1849992,5,SPIZA,24/04/2022,"Flat parking with plenty and sun depends on the time. The site is great with 11 spaces, close to the road but very quiet. Close to routes that can be done on foot or by bike... it has no services but the site is very good and clean. Let's keep taking care of it!"

23044,1315214,4,Gigins,11/07/2021,"Night with mini camper. Very quiet place, I only coincided with another van that was also spending the night. there is village lighting so I felt safe. the residents of the town also park a car. There are no services, no bins, and no gray water is the only negative."
23044,1117120,3,guenxmuerfel,22/11/2020,"Quite nice place! super remote, there was noone there when i spent the night there. Its quite far in the park, so you need to drive a while on these super steep roads, the access road has many potholes, but easy to avoid. The ruins nearby are not of special interest, and no view of the surrounding area"
23044,892604,5,Devin,23/07/2020,"Very quiet and beautiful place, clean and also relatively easy to reach (just narrow and partly on gravel roads) many cyclists come by but that doesn't bother us and sometimes a car."

23044,747926,3,floraandthenoviceexplorers,28/11/2019,"In a small camper the roads were ok, big pot holes. Off the beaten track, quiet but local authorities did drive past to check but we weren’t disturbed or moved on."
23044,733616,3,Franziki93,30/10/2019,"In advance: the journey was at night! The first kilometers over the mountain were good, as the road was paved (but 15% slope / serpentine) PS Weak Vans and longer WoMo's than 7.4m should avoid the climb !! .. After crossing the village was the ""road"" rather a motorcross track :-D with our ""normal"" van (Knaus Boxstar 630) barely beaten bar - tympani preprogrammed! The place itself was quite good, they just stood. Unfortunately it was a bit dirty and garbage was lying around. The return trip was a bit more relaxed during the day .. and the view was amazing! It was worth it!"

23044,501859,4,arracuu,02/06/2019,"The place is ideal. Fully isolated, no noise of any type nor light and surrounded by nature. I've had a great night. Of course, it is well hidden, the path to access is gravel and has many holes. Even so, the views from the road that they have of the Mediterranean Sea and the entire natural area of El Garraf are amazing."
23044,481455,5,Maevita,11/05/2019,"I stayed there two nights. I tried both roads, I have a Kangoo. From Sitges, the road that doesn’t go through the monastery is much shorter but indeed the last kilometer is really bumpy and you have to put first gear a few times to get over the pot holes.. the other one is longer but probably more manageable with a bigger camper van. It’s a good test to check if everything is tied up in your van ;)  the place is lovely. Thursday was really quiet, one other van next to me. Friday night a group of people arrived at 2:30am and left at 3:30 (?!) waking me up both times.. other than that. It was awesome!"
23044,442748,3,Goueno22,21/03/2019,Location very difficult to access. ONLY THE TRACK no road .. very winding and lots of bumps !! We left the step of the van! By cons to isolate several days it's ok ... but for a night too bad to go .. And van and van max 6ml not for motorhomes!
23044,433987,3,PeackockMonkeyballs,26/02/2019,Indeed very isolated and beautiful walks but what a long and terrible road to get there!

23044,366483,5,FloVwT5,06/09/2018,The words wilderness is well deserved. Flat ground on gravel. Very quiet places. I advocate the arrival and return by the Buddhist shrine the road and really well. I wanted to go back to the other side and it was long and very rough hairpin before arriving at a bridge under the highway (or a camper where a large van will not pass). I recommend
23044,221181,4,nicolasd44,02/02/2018,Small parking rather for small van. Access is via an unpaved forest road and not flat. Access not simple for a 5.40 m with bicycles. Privilege access by the Buddhist monastery the track will be less long. It is not possible to sleep at the private property monastery and farm parking except weekend.
23044,213050,4,marcosalvatravels,29/11/2017,Perfect for a night and for visit the park!

I recommend. swimming is a must."
23057,3052226,4,elenalens,31/07/2023,Very quiet place. No traffic. Just a pity that the toilets are still closed. The bar/restaurant is also very nicely located. You can eat and drink very cheaply. (3€ for 2 summersby) very friendly people too!
23057,2806241,5,Reiziger14,31/05/2023,"Wonderfully quiet, I had 2x 2 neighbors. Toilet block closed. There are a lot of ants, but if you don't sit on the floor you will hopefully not be bothered by them. For 3G/4G you have to walk 100m. You can swim in the lake. GNR drove by and said nothing. I would definitely come back here!"

I drove a little but further to the left and saw a spot under the restaurant. it was perfect for me and my cats! the only thing you hear is the birds."
23057,2612425,5,ker22,17/03/2023,"Great place, but be careful the water in the toilet is not drinkable, it is even loaded, do not put it in the reserve big risk for the pumps just good for rinsing the cassettes."
23057,2593269,5,Schneckenknaus,27/02/2023,"This car park (!] directly at the reservoir is wonderfully quiet and there is also a toilet house, garbage disposal anyway. The Mondina restaurant with very friendly, English-speaking service offers good regional cuisine. However, some block 'their' place here when they drive away. Please behave yourselves, dear campers, also in this CAR PARK."
23057,2585518,4,ChrisRabe,21/02/2023,"I like the place. When it rains there are big puddles. hiking trails. Please stop camping and keep it clean; Garbage cans on the side of the road! Weekend, Friday to Sunday, there was a lot going on locally: partying at the lake, cars driving back and forth, some barbecuing! Very quiet during the week. Toilet and cold shower opposite the restaurant, which is rustic and offers regional cuisine."
23057,2584206,5,wilmarja,20/02/2023,"Beautiful location on the lake. Peace! Starry sky! Behind the toilet block on the ladies side is a waste hole! The toilet block is clean, shower only cold water!"
23057,2574319,4,fvela,11/02/2023,Nice parking lot facing the lake. Very quiet day and night. Not much network. Filled with CC and impossible to take a walk in nature because everything is fenced. But go for one night.
23057,2558762,3,OzeanienArt-on-Tour,23/01/2023,"Actually a wonderful, quiet place, except on weekends, when it can quickly resemble a campsite :-( .. plastic carpet, awning, chairs, tables.. Especially disgusting: If you don't want to or can't use your own toilet, then please , go up the few meters.. there is a toilet opposite the restaurant!I escaped yesterday!"
23057,2535772,4,Klausagda,31/12/2022,"With the lake now full, it is a very quiet place, especially at night, with a beautiful view and many opportunities for walking. The nearby restaurant offers very good Alentejo cuisine with large portions at reasonable prices, nice operators. And with a window seat you could also guard your car downstairs yourself..."
23057,2510885,5,NicoleHedera,02/12/2022,Nice beautiful spot. Its restaurant near by
23057,2421315,2,SarahBeccsi,03/10/2022,"We drove back after 10 minutes. Hardly any water in the lake, no shady places and an awful lot of mosquitoes that made sitting outside unbearable. However, if you are looking for absolute peace, this is the place for you. Were the only ones at the lake and far and wide nobody was to be seen."

23057,2339084,3,3iTruck,04/09/2022,"Simple parking by the lake. Easy access in heavy weight (12T - 10M). Unfortunately the water level is very low at the moment. For small vehicles or those who are not shy, the “pain nature” spot above is more welcoming but there is a very big rut on the way."

The sanitary building was open and maintained. Not much going on in the area but a good choice for one night"
23057,2214900,4,McDreamy2022,11/08/2022,"Nice quiet spot. We have an old campervan so the roads to there are a bit too bumpy, just drive slower and look out for bumps. Don’t spill your coffee! ;) haha. It is a water purification plant though. The photos don’t show that in the same lake/ river at this spot there is that plant. I tried to add photos to this but didn’t work :) It’s safe here though! No mosquitoes! Restaurant opens at 12:00pm"
23057,1974299,3,amg1976,13/06/2022,"Stayed for one night, very quiet and peaceful. Went for a swim in the morning.

23057,1838409,5,Rasputin108,19/04/2022,"Super nice place in the middle of nature with access to a beautiful hiking trail. Cell phone network down on the pitch very bad, a few meters up the mountain or along the lake it gets better again. Campers have been coming here regularly for years because they really appreciate the place."
23057,1817119,5,MarinoRottier,12/04/2022,Wonderfully quiet place! Nice view of the lake. Also happy with the (free) hot shower and the toilets :)

23057,1794522,5,worldvan2020,25/03/2022,"Very nice quiet place on the lake with garbage cans and a café nearby, but the latter was closed. Cell phone reception is almost zero, 2G-3G with luck. We had a mobile LTE router with us and it didn't have a stable network either, so it was borderline for working in the van."
23057,1792699,5,Seegurke3000,23/03/2022,"Nice, very quiet place on the lake with clean toilets and showers with warm water (!!!) a bit further up. There is also a restaurant/cafe with good coffee and phenomenal homemade cakes. High recommendation from our side!"

23057,1131466,4,petyametya,18/01/2021,"So far the absolute best spot we've to stay for several nights - if you are looking for a serene landscape. There were about 6-8 vans spread well out, with a view over the lake. Possible to wander the paths around the water. It's super quiet, some motorsport going on on occasion, but not too much. Internet is bad though :("
23057,1077942,4,wir-leben-mobil,01/10/2020,Relatively quiet parking lot with a view over the reservoir. The sanitary facilities were closed in September 2020. Garbage bins are right on the square.

23057,793656,4,jlabeille,10/03/2020,Very nice spacious place on the dam. There is a small restaurant upstairs and a few places spread over the area where there are mobile homes everywhere. At the bottom of the water you can stand directly on the meadow. Very quiet night here.
23057,790698,5,RVFreedom,04/03/2020,Still the lovely peaceful place i remember 10 years ago although much busier then. Unfortunately the selfish  practice of putting chairs out to reserve a space still happens. If people want to do that go on a payed campsite you have no right to a space here. Move it you loose it is the rule.
23057,781993,5,robinreems,17/02/2020,Love this place :) this time we even went to the restaurant (we’re both vegans so we never go out to eat) and they made the loveliest vegan dish for us. The people over there are so sweet the kids speak English very well.

Lovely place *rant incoming* aside from the few obnoxious motorhomes who idle their engines, play loud music and generally act like they are the only ones who exist. Let's keep places like this motorhome friendly by being a bit more aware."

23057,766709,3,AnneTheke,09/01/2020,"Space very quiet, unfortunately the reservoir looked a bit sad (Jan. 2020). Restaurant within easy walking distance, food was good, owner very friendly, we only looked at the sanitary building, so no assessment. To relax and for a quiet night completely fine."
23057,752888,5,wicklow86,12/12/2019,"Great for a night, lovely view. Free toilets and shower opposite the restaurant. Shoes needed in shower as floor gets muddy otherwise great - temperature control and proper shower head."

You can stand at the top of the restaurant (there are also the toilets) or down at the ""lake"" (the temporarily contains little water) Quiet, sheltered and clean. The other nature / environment is quite nice but there are more impressive spots."
23057,738503,4,Mikalisa,04/11/2019,"Super quiet place, there is a restaurant and hot showers nearby (washed every morning). We were not lucky because when we arrived there was fog and we left early the next day. According to a regular met in the morning the place is great!"

23057,491531,3,Barcobird,24/05/2019,"Basically a piece of waste land that the motorhomes have decided to park on and it's tolerated. Overlooking the lake it's a very calm, peaceful and tranquil spot where you can enjoy walks, fishing or just sunbathe on the sunbed. There is a restaurant/bar about 100 meters away and opposite this is a toilet block with showers. The downside, midges and flies are in abundance and are very irritable."

The toilets were very clean and had toilet paper, hand towels and soap. The restaurant was nice with cheap beer but their internet is not great and there is hardly any service in the area. There’s recycling and bins also and a tap for water. It’s very secluded but with many campers on the weekend. There are some walks round the hillside and the lake by the dam. Stayed 3 nights."

A few meters further down the lake, some campers and vans spend the night. But it is also enough space for everyone. The night was quiet and the starry sky was gigantic. There are some mosquitoes (in the shower they are waiting for bare skin), which is quite normal on a lake. We were disturbed by the strong sewage treatment plant / slurry smell in the morning, which could hardly be ignored. That's why we left quickly. Otherwise it is by the sanitary facilities almost a free campsite."

23135,3188592,3,BenjaminGeorges,20/08/2023,Municipal campsite of Coimbra. Arrive at the beginning of the afternoon in season to benefit from a shady pitch. Paying swimming pool but preferential price for the campsite. To visit the city by bike is complicated because there is not really a dedicated track. So the bus remains at 1.70€ but random times. We used the VTC Bolt via Google Map to get around. Less than 5€/4pers. to reach the center!

In short, I recommend the campsite!"
23135,2131954,3,homegus,27/07/2022,"Campsite near Coimbra. There is a bus stop in front to go to the center, although I recommend uber from 3 people. Bus €1.60 and Uber about €4 without waiting. The campsite itself does not have anything more than services with very spacious showers, yes, the paper has to be taken outside at the entrance door to the block (I had a hard time finding it), there is no hand soap and a single socket for a hairdryer in the block. There is a swimming pool that belongs to a gym for which you have to pay an extra €3 to enjoy it if you are at the campsite. For all this I only give it three stars since the price seems expensive for what it is and they charge you separately for the pool. We are going by car with 3 adults and 2 girls (from 12 they are considered an adult) with electricity it costs €37 per day. It is true that it is high season but for this price I understand that the pool should not be charged (€15 for an afternoon in the pool). Another thing is that the Wi-Fi does not reach the plots, only in the reception and bar that are next door. Which for me with 3 teenagers is a small problem. I recommend it to visit Coimbra and be calm with the car but for the same price if you don't spend the night you can park elsewhere, visit the city and go elsewhere."

23135,497660,5,marcelo1402,30/05/2019,"Great place. People friendly. Supermarket walk distance. A little expensive. We have paid 23 euros for 2 people, one rv larger than 6m and electricity"
23135,491371,3,Paxy,24/05/2019,"Partial opening of the campsite so the sites are almost fully exploited, it was necessary to open a new area without sanitary. The city is not very close but possibility to take a bus. The road borders the campsite so a little noise. A little expensive for the benefit."
23135,466890,3,Tebi_design,24/04/2019,"A little away from the center. The plots are not marked and each one parks where you see. If you take the van to the center, as it was my case, when you return your plot may be busy and have to find a new place. Bathrooms and showers clean and in good condition"

23135,374580,5,mauricio-brasil,15/09/2018,"Very spacious and well maintained. Lots of power boxes. It only needs a demarcation of the vacancies, because the users park anyway. In the water supply there is no hose, take your hose. The bathrooms are large and the taps handy, without the hassle of having to keep pressing the button at all times."
23135,356676,4,Tierras_Insolitas,27/08/2018,"The campsite is a bit far from the city, but there are buses to get there. The bathrooms are very good and the plots are large. A van and two people € 17 in August."

23135,219851,4,romainL,22/01/2018,"For our part, very friendly welcome, bus actually very few. In the off-season, pleasant camping, depending on where we park, we hear very little road. Sanitary means (the water flows everywhere except on oneself) but very hot water."
23135,206175,2,jazfiend,26/10/2017,Not very sexy because overhanging fast tracks a little sound. Home cold and especially buses leaving near the camp are infrequent (every 60 or 90 minutes). Did not fit our expectations for Coimbra. We have left.
23135,179281,4,Queixas,18/08/2017,"Good camping with everything you need. 22 euros 2 people, AC and electricity .. You can go by bike to Coimbra, the return is uphill. 1 hour walking .."
23135,178019,3,BD,17/08/2017,"Camping almost empty last night. So location to choose. 23 euros for 3 with the reduction map of the book of campsites in Portugal. Place behind the batch of sanitary 2, we do not hear the road which does not seem to be the case on the other side ... We can leave the campsite from 7am (need anyone to disconnect electricity). So if you book the university visit the day before (which is preferable) for 9am, it's playable before the crowd! For us it was 10am not knowing. Friendly welcome. Sanitary ok"
23135,170359,3,palmera,10/08/2017,"Nice camping but not worth 4 stars indeed. The first day we had free access to the pool after it was 3 euros per person. Ask the front desk for bus schedules, infrequent but very convenient, morning bread in the cafeteria."
23135,162005,3,jpaml,31/07/2017,"Camping a bit expensive for my taste 2 adults, 2 teenagers, large motorhome. Electricity 31.75 € wc without paper, dish tray without hot water"

23135,147812,5,mimilat34,03/07/2017,Camping corect on the terrace. The trees are too young to provide sufficient shade in case of heat wave. Well for a stopover in the university city when the parking of the swimming pool of Combria is crowded which is often the case in season.
23135,140883,2,marinier59,05/06/2017,"Camping 4 * it deserves only 2 as my rating. No more locks at the doors of showers, questionable maintenance, no papers with toilets. Bus 38 in front of € 1.60 for the center. yellow bus at 12 € always in front of the campsite but 15 stops without interest. Supermarket Pingo Doce at 100 meters and fuel station next to Jumbo (Auchan) .The least expensive of Portugal and with gpl. To see absolutely the university the chapel and the Joanina library, the velha and the student districts"
23135,138413,3,Vickkk,27/05/2017,"Beautiful spaces but not delimited. Really too close to the road: road traffic sustained a few tens of meters. A bit expensive: 22 € for a vehicle and electricity and 2 people. The shower is very ""noisy"". Nice home. Well placed to visit the Conimbriga site."

23135,99055,3,javrive,23/08/2016,Good camping to visit Coimbra. Little shade and the pool is paid separately. It is recommended to ask for a taxi to take you to the center. It has a supermarket next door.
23135,92396,2,galixma,10/08/2016,A small pool quite noisy because close to the roads a few km from the city center a bus certainly takes us we opted for bikes! camping in more.

Few shadows and places not always flat (camping in stages). sanitary space and clean and sufficient in number, perfect for a prolonged halt on Coimbra."
23135,67131,4,Christiantardieu,02/04/2016,"Mr. Tardieu: a stay of a few days, a very friendly welcome, a very well organized campground, bus services for downtown very well. Grocery, bar, water, electricity, showers, WC, nothing to say I recommend it."

23149,3286794,2,elsaancillo,11/09/2023,"a true experience, you don't know if you are in a campsite or entering a shanty town or Fabela, especially the tent area, there are about 40% of campsites that live there in a commune in certain conditions... we have been through a night and used the shower service and nothing to complain about hot water, good pressure at night it depends on the area you are in, you don't end up being calm"

23149,3269271,2,fabiorozza,07/09/2023,"Old campsite with poor services in relation to the price paid (36 euros/night for 2 adults and 2 children aged 11). The location is not even that far from the city center, but there is a bus stop in front. The bathrooms are old, only the shower has hot water. The settled neighborhood is in very poor condition. I wouldn't go back."
23149,3268260,1,amni,07/09/2023,"If to see rocks and cliffs in the sea or see the crowded tourist town that you cannot even walk around in peace, it is necessary to sleep in a dive, I recommend that you pass by, we wanted to stay several days but we opted for one day and xk It was late, otherwise we wouldn't have been there for a day, not dirty, next thing and don't think about taking a shower with hot water because there isn't any, horrible"
23149,3258848,1,Luisetesteban,04/09/2023,"Well located for visiting the rocky coast, but the facilities are horrible and outdated. The price is expensive for what it offers"
23149,3256701,4,Danielvera,04/09/2023,"We were there two nights. The location is really ideal for visiting the beautiful rocky coast and the city of Lagos. We were totally surprised. Sanitary facilities are outdated, but not dirty. The people are very nice and it's cheap. 17€ two people and T5"
23149,3250337,3,MulderMalaga,02/09/2023,"Although close to the beach and the center (20 minutes walk), the campsite is poor, with small pitches, everything very old, average showers. Dirty and poorly maintained bathrooms. For what it offers it is expensive 26 euros. Everything catastrophic. I also recommend the alternative."
23149,3237614,2,susgott,30/08/2023,"Location is good, the rest is catastrophic. No soap or toilet paper in the toilets, and you even pay for WiFi. The overnight stay with electricity costs 19 €/night, for the service offered a cheek. If you have another alternative, you should take it."
23149,3228288,2,pippoburchi,28/08/2023,"Chaotic campsite. Pitches attached to each other with almost no privacy. If passing through ok, but I don't recommend staying more than one night"
23149,3201362,2,JessicaAmbrosi,22/08/2023,"poorly maintained campsite despite the cost for one night/two people in a Van about €17. cash only. surely people have lived there for a long time but they do not create disturbance. the bathrooms, albeit with hot water, are dirty but accessible. it's fine to spend a night as it is close to the town center."
23149,3200969,1,TereAlbiach,22/08/2023,"We wasted all morning, the unpleasant receptionists kept us waiting from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., without telling us if we could enter or not, and I give one star for the site."
23149,3187476,3,himbeerwald,20/08/2023,"We were there before 1 p.m. and got a reasonable place for a larger campervan (6.80, 19 € 2 adults). At night it was quiet and cool. Further back by the tents it takes some getting used to. But you are very close to beautiful beaches and right in the old town. Perfect for us for one night."
23149,3180202,5,IvanLol15,19/08/2023,The campsite follows these times: 09:00 - 23:00
23149,3159526,2,Aezeiza,16/08/2023,"The only good thing about this campsite is the location. The facilities are very old rather than dirty, they are not maintained at all."
23149,3151926,3,jennyalvaro,15/08/2023,"Camping near the beach and walking distance from lakes. Clean showers but unmarked pitches. A Camper, 2 people and electricity 19.50 euros per night. You have to get there early because then there is no room. A place without more but to spend a night it is fine"
23149,3148430,2,stefanodt,14/08/2023,"Two stars because it has the bare minimum and is in the centre, otherwise it is a poorly maintained place, dirty toilets and inefficient reception."
23149,3146107,3,itasvolleyforever,14/08/2023,Simple but clean campsite. 5 minutes walk from Praia Dona Ana and the center of Lagos. Paid 18€ per night with the camper and two people. There is a small bar on the campsite. All services nearby. All right!
23149,3137918,3,Thorwald1963,13/08/2023,"After the bad reviews we were curious what to expect. But it wasn't bad. The problem in Portugal is that there is hardly any investment, you can see that in all the facilities here. Vacationers and dropouts close together. The location is great, the beach or the old town are just a few minutes' walk away."
23149,3131834,3,CamillaGara,12/08/2023,"from previous reviews we thought we were going to find it a total disaster, however we were fine. yes, some bathrooms were dirty, but for a night or two it's perfect. the showers are large and free, both hot and cold, it is very close to the historic center of lagos, really nice, and equally close to praia dona ana, so approved!"

23149,3101133,1,JOSEANTONIO78,08/08/2023,"Disastrous, old, bathrooms stinking of piss, the toilets without lids, litter bins full. I think they only get cleaned once a day from what I see. the old facilities very left. Unpainted walls for years. You enter and if you find something free you stay, no indication from the staff. We went in, saw what was there and left. It's not even useful for spending the night."
23149,3070306,1,968702448,03/08/2023,"It occurred to us to go in, the owner told us to try to park in two places, one very small that we could not fit in and the other in a plot that was occupied by some chairs and a table with a very bad appearance next to an abandoned caravan, nowhere moment he accompanied us to show us the plots. The image is of total abandonment, it's like the three thousand homes but camping, I wouldn't go back"
23149,3066848,1,Catootje,03/08/2023,"Well… As described, good to visit the old town. And that is definitely recommended! But the campsite is really to cry. Within the walls and high-rise buildings around it. Feels like a prison area. Toilets and showers are so old it's just very filthy. I'm really used to it and you won't hear me complaining easily, but we won't come here anymore."
23149,3048983,3,giulytoby,31/07/2023,optimal camping for a night or two to visit the center of lagos and surroundings. just don't be too pretentious and settle for service in the area. water and supplies included in the price
23149,3047705,5,Sarimar2023,30/07/2023,"We really liked the campsite. The showers were very warm and really clean! Emptying the chemical toilet, draining gray water and filling up with fresh water worked great (thanks to the hose). Shady places, good location in town (200m to the nearest supermarket, restaurant right on the square) and within walking distance to various bathing bays. We would come back!"

23149,3009084,3,Camperlifevan,23/07/2023,Very central to visit Lagos and the beaches. Price relatively okay. Some (not proper) people have their permanent residence there. Seems weird.
23149,2993220,3,feschm,20/07/2023,"The place is not nice, but the sanitary is clean. Quite good as a place to stay to explore Lagos and really nice beaches. You shouldn't expect more. Cheap in high season."
23149,2964938,1,Rapidina,14/07/2023,"I put a star to be able to give my opinion, because it does not deserve any. The manager was not at the reception, we entered and he came to meet us and without saying a word or asking, making gestures to us, he threw us out in a bad way. We didn't care at all because the campsite looks dirty, abandoned, dusty, with caravans full of dirt as if they have been living there for many years"
23149,2956473,4,Smau2k,13/07/2023,"The structure appears rather dilapidated, even the services and common areas have repairs and finishes done ""as best they can"", but above all everything is perfectly clean and the strengths are 2: the price, €17 for a van and two adults, it's the location, perfect for the beaches and especially the town centre, all on the doorstep, which bumps a 3 into a 4!"
23149,2953192,5,SABBAT23,12/07/2023,"A place of a special kind. Relaxed, diverse togetherness under old, large-grown eucalyptus trees. A small oasis behind protective walls of tourist town."
23149,2947847,3,JasnaSijak,10/07/2023,"Campsite with a good location for getting around the city. Fair showers and kitchen utensils washing area, I've only seen mixed showers, then there are also those for men / women. Dusty driveways, ditto the pitches. There are tall buildings around. We spent only one night here, it was peaceful."
23149,2934914,4,charlottehelena29,07/07/2023,"Perfect place to stay when visiting Lagos. Town and beaches very accessible by foot. Clean facilities, hot showers.

23149,2933334,5,martina1308,07/07/2023,"It is not as most comments say, the facilities are a bit old but everything is clean, the showers and bathrooms are very clean. The best thing is that it is well located very close to the center. We are 4 and for €28 a night we were able to recharge light and water, and empty the black water tank."

23149,2919257,2,Troglodita,03/07/2023,"Very expensive for what it offers. We went in one night because we needed to recharge the battery. All very poorly maintained and dirty. There are people who usually live there, so it looked like the type of shops and accumulation of things, it was full of junk and dirt. Although the caravan area there are more people passing through and the truth is that we did not have a bad feeling during the night, but I would not repeat it."
23149,2916290,2,FaEli,02/07/2023,"8.5m in 27/6/2023 out 28/6/2023. €21.5 per night with electricity. There are a few well-marked pitches. If they are busy, you park where you can. Gray water discharge is impossible for long motorhomes. Deplorable reception staff. Expensive for what it offers and how it offers it. A little kindness and cooperation towards paying guests would be the minimum. Close to beaches."
23149,2900711,5,geisi92,28/06/2023,Best campsite! Central! near the beach! Very clean sanitary facilities. Friendly staff and a certain flair on this place. I love it and it's my 3rd year in a row. (A bit like coming home).
23149,2897471,3,chiaraciaffoni,27/06/2023,"Very close to both the center and the beaches, this allows you to move on foot. The campsite is not maintained and the toilet facilities are not the best but it's ok to spend a night. We paid €19.50 for a two-person van and electricity. I give three stars because we had a quiet night and we very much appreciated being able to visit Lagos on foot. Paid wifi we did not use."
23149,2896655,3,HaraldSchell,27/06/2023,"On the whole, the campsite is ok, but some of the residents there are very noisy overnight and everything is getting old. Although fine and fairly clean. The pitches are messed up. You are super close to the city center, which is of course a big advantage. Good English, no idea why it is different in the description."
23149,2895616,1,JFdjim,26/06/2023,Very noisy campsite.
23149,2887721,4,lalamelville,24/06/2023,"Stayed 2 nights here and despite the negative comments, we felt it was safe and clean enough. Sure the toilets and showers are dated, but we found them clean and fine. The staff were always on the premise and we even saw them running down people to make sure they were guests at the site. this made us feel safe leaving the van there all day. don’t expect 5 star amenities but rather a great spot!"
23149,2877916,2,Chuska2022,21/06/2023,"Tatty, old, dirty and expensive. The only thing going for it is the location if you want to be close to the center of Lagos."
23149,2876967,4,nacris77,21/06/2023,"Parking well located, simple but sufficient for a stopover to discover the city and its magnificent cliffs. The market in the city center is uninteresting and the visit to the slave museum is not worth the detour."

23149,2863978,5,jocegege02,17/06/2023,Campsite located near the town center and the beach. Very nice home. We feel very good there. I recommend
23149,2861616,3,jerryledge,16/06/2023,The place is very well located. 19€ for a camper with electricity. Not the cleanest but its ok for a night.
23149,2851602,4,RixtenFedde,13/06/2023,"Great camping, close to everything. Enough showers and toilets, old but really clean. Large spots, you can choose. We paid 17€ for a van and 2 persons (high season price from 01/06). Minus 1 star for the reception, not really friendly and didn’t open on time. Maybe just a bad day?"
23149,2840518,4,manugarri,10/06/2023,"showers were pretty clean, and water was the right temperature. excellent location."
23149,2838214,3,NIDIonTour,10/06/2023,"Pitch in the middle of Lagos! Free choice of pitches, sometimes a little difficult to drive on. We didn't want to stay there at first because of the negative reviews, but would have regretted it. There are definitely no homeless people living there, rather dropouts. Old but clean sanitary facilities. And the location is unique. We would stay there again anytime. Stayed for one night in early May."
23149,2837576,4,Bilgolaj,09/06/2023,"Lots of negative comments about this place, but it is fine, yes it’s a bit of a shanti town, yes it’s a bit run down, but everything works and it’s a great location"
23149,2833999,1,moralesga,08/06/2023,"An unbeatable area, it would be a 7-star, now the services do not exist, the state of the facilities is unpleasant and appalling"
23149,2833806,4,veedeepee,08/06/2023,Nice place. (Especially downstairs after the entrance.) Idk a bit run down but if you look through it it's doable. Had expected worse given all the reviews but it was better than expected.
23149,2832871,2,fstiegler,08/06/2023,"The campsite has a top location: 10 minutes walk to the historic center, 5 minutes to the nearest beach (through the former football stadium). Negative: the place has the charm of Lost Place or abandoned premises. Totally run down. No toilet seats and toilet paper, long-term campers resemble slum dwellings. barbed wire enclosure. We actually wanted to stay here longer."
23149,2831782,5,HazelGale,08/06/2023,Brilliant 5 day /night stay ❤️felt so save❤️❤️ ok it hasn't got the materialistic gimmicks but what is has got is character and charm ☺️

23149,2816788,5,JoshBriggs,03/06/2023,"Giving this 5 stars due to the poor star rating. We had a lovely site under a tree, incredible location with great access to the old town and some of the nicest beaches you’ll ever see. All the amenities worked and were very clean. For its price it is well worth it. Nothing beats a hot shower when they are few and far between and the showers were great!"
23149,2816787,5,DaisyTour2023,03/06/2023,We had very low expectations from the reviews but were surprised with how clean and great the campsite was. Everything was so clean and the staff were super helpful. This place was close to EVERYTHING!!! Old town a few minutes walk and the best beaches were about five minutes walk! Couldn’t recommend more for staying in Lagos!
23149,2808899,2,Sergis,01/06/2023,"Bah, it has the merit of existing, and can help out but not terrible, everything is old and very moderately clean. On the other hand very well located and alone in Lagos, it is what makes its strength, otherwise it would be empty or almost."

23149,2791266,1,IrisRupp,27/05/2023,The only plus is the proximity to the center.
23149,2791030,1,SueWinter,27/05/2023,The only thing it has going for it is the location. Looks like a shanty town. Motorhomes parked haphazardly and packed in. Overlooked by an apartment block. Eventually found a spot but when I got out of the van it smelled of poo. We didn't stay.
23149,2776392,1,Truschner,22/05/2023,"Very large area, warm welcome but be careful... I sank slightly in the sand overnight, although I thought the belay spot was perfect before. No chance of getting out the next morning. Got towing assistance from the site at no cost"
23149,2765743,1,Poppsi,20/05/2023,"Anyone who wants to spend their vacation surrounded by a wall with barbed wire has found their dream spot here. Never seen such a unkempt and run down campsite. Yes, it is the only one in Lagos...but there is a campsite in Luz (16 minutes from Lagos) that is really nice and the price is also okay (31€ per night for 2 people campers)."
23149,2763779,2,iamorazio,19/05/2023,"The camping itself is nice. The facilities are old, in bad condition and they don't care about that. Things are broken, most of the toilet seat are missing and when they ''repair'' something it looks like a 5Y old child did it."
23149,2762920,2,TomasainoS,19/05/2023,"€14.80 one night, without electricity. Dirty place, without apparent order, abandoned caravans, it looked like a ghetto, people who looked like they were taking drugs. We stayed because we didn't have another. we won't be back."
23149,2753812,3,sannesimons,16/05/2023,"Fine for a visit to Lagos. Close to the beach, you can roll into the center by bike (back is a bit of a climb). The campsite has shady spots. There is litter and 2 toilet blocks are outdated and dirty. There is a third, which is more difficult to find. Walk a little up and turn right, it's in the back. When you're down, it's busy early with campers emptying and leaving."
23149,2751591,4,Bamboujos,15/05/2023,"Bad impression on arrival, you have to find a place on the left near the old football field. The toilets are dilapidated but very clean for 14€ for two with electricity it's very correct. very close to the center and the beaches. The building next door is a beautiful hotel with direct access to the beach and we are 5 minutes from a site that is really worth a visit: Ponta da piedade, a must see"
23149,2750475,1,SimoeGino,15/05/2023,"Old, run down, neglected campsite. The structures are dilapidated and decadent, even if they are not dirty, but since construction I think they have never done maintenance. The area is cluttered and filthy! I give one star because I paid 14€ per night for 2 people with Van and electricity, cheap, and comfortable in the center of Lagos and the beaches."
23149,2748130,4,ReinerReisdorf,14/05/2023,"Only place to stay in Lagos. Friendly welcome. Quite tight with our 8 meter Womo. We don't need plumbing and supply and disposal was easy to use. The so beautiful old town and the harbor only 10 minutes walk. That makes up for it! Paid 17 euros with 3 people and a dog, without electricity."
23149,2746633,2,AndreasWiegmann,13/05/2023,"drove up, turned a lap and immediately drove down again. just the first impression was enough. looks dirty and tight and something of uncomfortable. Washrooms were not entered at all"
23149,2743539,4,RasselbandeBPS,12/05/2023,"The campsite is in a great location, 5 minutes from downtown Lagos with numerous bars and restaurants. The upstairs toilets and showers are old but still clean. I got a good spot on the lower level, there was shade and the spot was bordered by greenery. I find the price-performance ratio very good in the great location and would come again!"
23149,2736772,4,GiddyGirl,09/05/2023,"A great campsite near all amenities. Clean facilities, friendly site with a hippy vibe and reasonable. Dogs welcome. plentydog friendly beaches within 10- 15 mins recommended. Love it!"
23149,2733059,4,jmchaubourg,08/05/2023,"Do not let yourself be impressed by the arrival and the environment, but this campsite located in the center of Lagos, welcomes you with kindness and even if the facilities are aging, everything is very clean and that is the most important thing."
23149,2732092,3,tambi47,07/05/2023,"The bad impression I had when I arrived was quickly dissipated. The sanitary facilities are dilapidated but as clean as in other campsites with a higher price per night. Friendly atmosphere, close to the center and the beaches."
23149,2731834,5,fub66,07/05/2023,surprising at first sight but a nice mix with a precarious population that lives there all year round. clean toilets. Ideal for a walking tour of Lagos which is very pleasant and walks on coastal paths with exceptional views and beautiful coves for swimming. We spent 2 quiet nights there.
23149,2728659,3,tsigan,06/05/2023,Excellent location and low cost. Plenty of shade. Toilets and shower areas are dire. We used our motorhome ones. But the location is the big plus and so worth it to just walk into town
23149,2728375,2,cmanton,06/05/2023,Well located to visit the center and the beaches but very little care. Valid for one night but very old.
23149,2724211,1,Schweden10,05/05/2023,Good place to explore the Lagos. Area otherwise dingy and partly very dirty. It's a shame that there isn't more joy and interest in the whole thing. Reception speaks English but there was never a porter present. Everyone could enter the place who wanted.
23149,2721137,4,chrislb29,04/05/2023,Very very dilapidated but so close to the beaches and the center. Attractive price 15 euros with electricity.
23149,2720089,4,bails51,03/05/2023,"Facilities were a bit old and not a place to stay for a long time but for the cost and proximity to the walks, beaches and old town very much recommended.
I'd recommend one of the first pitches on the right as you drive in. Seems a bit hectic at the top."
23149,2718043,4,syljo53,02/05/2023,for me a very very good campsite. certainly in its own juice but the reception is quite suitable and they speak French. the showers and toilets not luxurious but cleaned daily and adequate. I felt very very well there. In addition it is quiet and very well located for all the walks to do. I recommend without hesitation except for people accustomed to great cleanliness
23149,2716706,2,DiegoVWt6,02/05/2023,"It cost us €11.50 per night, without electricity. The power outlet is far away. Needs a coat of paint, would look better."
23149,2712615,4,natanael29,01/05/2023,"A good place to spend a night or two, the campsite is not luxurious but has the basics. It is a quiet and very central place in the city of Lagos, I recommend it."
23149,2709415,3,Romy1306,30/04/2023,A rather tired campsite !! All the facilities worked fine and were adequate for our needs.  Anarchy regarding the pitches and at the top it’s complete chaos with who parks where !!! In the middle of the town so very convenient indeed but as there is no competition in Lagos then it can stay the way it is rather than improve its pitches.
23149,2704618,1,Schel,28/04/2023,"Wanted to visit Lagos today and stay at the campsite. What we saw shocked me a bit. I have accepted that campers are not wanted in Portugal, but something dirty and run down surpasses everything that has come before. It's a pity, because the campers also bring money to the country."
23149,2704154,1,jlacacho,28/04/2023,"I don't give it even one star. It's been a long time since I've seen a campsite as bad, dirty and neglected as this one. Really, do not bother or go near. Terrible"
23149,2699638,2,aoberson,26/04/2023,"It's a pity that for such a touristy city, the campsite is borderline ""slum city"" but for a night's stay it's just the job, the price is right, the reception not great"
23149,2696065,4,Christian37800,25/04/2023,Very good value for money. for two people: €12 without electricity / €14.5 with. free but relatively small pitches. very clean sanitary facilities and CC services included. staff do not speak French but English. to recommend.
23149,2695865,5,threeasabird,25/04/2023,We were not sure what to expect given the low rating on here but we really enjoyed this campsite. It’s in a perfect location to go into Lagos
23149,2689978,5,lebronjames2306,23/04/2023,"Great central square. Nearby there is a skate park including a playground for the children. Magnificent beaches nearby, Praia de Dona Ana is only 400 meters away. Short way to the old town. We feel that we are in good hands as a family."
23149,2684986,5,sverabe,21/04/2023,"After all the comments, we didn't even want to come with our 2 children. We can't do anything with all the negatives. The staff is very nice, the place is old, so are the sanitary facilities but they are very clean, and the location can't be beat! We have extended and would come again!"
23149,2684984,1,eijaapp,21/04/2023,"Good location. That is the only positive thing. Dirty facilities, cold water, horrible toilets."
23149,2684022,2,fredyber,20/04/2023,"spent 2 quiet nights but the campsite is miserable, very very dilapidated. On the other hand, well located for visiting Lagos and the surrounding area. The staff is very lax, 2 hours to get the connections while they are going around in circles in the office. They only speak English. In short, I didn't like it at all, draining into the gutter on the grid and no water for the black water. Disappointed!!!"
23149,2682580,2,vanhula,20/04/2023,"The only reason to stay here is the location. Otherwise there is nothing nice on the pitch. But due to a lack of alternatives and only for one night, we made it through. 13 euros for van, 2 people and a dog WITHOUT electricity is also so semi for this ""place""."
23149,2674690,4,iftjourney,16/04/2023,A friendly relaxed stopover and a great location to explore Lagos. Simple dated services but they do the job. Would return
23149,2669808,4,WallWall,14/04/2023,"Wonderful alternative, especially further back. Shower very warm. Attention dog owners, there are cats. :-)"
23149,2668941,3,hilger,14/04/2023,Very rustic campsite in the middle of the city. Everything is there but very run down. near the beach and cliffs
23149,2664059,3,silvio135,12/04/2023,"For lack of alternatives, we spent two nights here to visit Lagos. The toilets and sinks are fine. The location very central. I would not recommend the place for families because there are homeless people living in this place. We paid €12.50 per night."
23149,2663898,2,JamesRollier,12/04/2023,"Bad, poor hygiene, dusty location, freelance installation, reception staff not concerned and whose joviality must emerge from a miracle. In short, one night and stop."
23149,2661021,3,iparrorratz,11/04/2023,"A very basic campsite, the facilities a bit old and neglected. Close to the center and a good option to spend a night."
23149,2659659,1,coockie57,10/04/2023,"The campsite is located near the beautiful cliffs and beaches at Lagos (walking distance). That's a big advantage. And with that the most important thing is said. For the rest, confirmation of the other critical comments. How unfortunate. Good for one night."
23149,2657494,4,Klunkertusse,10/04/2023,"We stood here 10 days and loved it. Lush trees and free choice of space. You have to like it. Don't be put off by the somewhat ramshackle charm. The nights are quiet. Many dropouts with tents. Hot showers for free. Washing machine 4€ and clothesline. Cheap bars and restaurants all around, 10 minutes to the beach and old town. What more do you want?"
23149,2647070,3,peterpeh,07/04/2023,"Well located pitch close to the old town and the beach. However quite loud street noise. Sanitary completely run down. Reception speaks English. Price ok (12 €). We stayed 1 night, ok for that."
23149,2646928,2,Aniatxu,07/04/2023,"No one at reception. Dirty showers and no hot water. The neglected campsite, and someone had emptied their dirty water in a plot. The man who came to collect the garbage was very kind, that's why I don't give it 1 star."
23149,2646031,4,myhanna,07/04/2023,"Price and performance are just right here. The place is kept very simple, but you have everything you need. Electricity, toilets and showers and an unbeatable location in the middle of town and close to the beach. We paid €15.50 for a motorhome with 2 people and 2 dogs."
23149,2640358,4,aisido,05/04/2023,"Just what is necessary, a base camp for 2/3 days. battle baths and showers. very reasonable price, in line with the quality. Perfect for us, very centrally located, spacious pitches, very friendly guy with a beard at reception, calm atmosphere at this time, I guess summer will be another story. recommended if you are passing through"
23149,2637276,1,driveaday,03/04/2023,"If you want to experience the feeling of Woodstock, you have to go here. Here you will find enough ""dropouts"" including animals. In addition, dirty and unkempt facilities. There is currently no electricity. And the electricity would be the only pro argument. Simple pitches with outdated sanitary facilities are certainly not a problem - but dirty and unkempt pitches? That doesn't have to be the case in this beautiful country."
23149,2631795,3,StefanLaura,31/03/2023,"€15 per night including electricity. Sanitary facilities outdated, only cleaned once in 2 days, it was dirty. Happy plumbing in camper. Within walking distance of the pleasant center."
23149,2630743,4,Wastl95,30/03/2023,"Pragmatic place to stand in Lagos. The facilities are dated and unfortunately not that clean, but the place is really cheap and it's easy to get to the beach or the entrance to the Punta da Piedade Walk along the coast."
23149,2622824,4,KlaBrig,24/03/2023,"Great central location. Everything you need is available. The staff is friendly and of course speaks English. Visually, the outer walls and the outdated infrastructure do not invite spoiled German tourists. But it is Portugal, not a rich country. But clean. Reasonable price for this location. Recommendation for nostalgics"
23149,2618966,4,JanLehtonen,21/03/2023,"Cleaning efficient, yards raked of leaves.
Of course, when it's old, it's not quite at today's level.
We liked it and the price-quality ratio was right.
Camper + 2 person 11.50e/night (no electricity).
Easy access to the beach and downtown.
A peaceful nights we spend."
23149,2614100,4,duchdid,18/03/2023,"awesome location. beaches and nice little town with pedestrian bars, restaurants, shops 2 steps away on foot. Old campsite, not very well maintained and not always very clean, small pitches quickly filled BUT friendly staff who speak English. forget WiFi. location, location, location. Great."
23149,2612030,4,PLG56680,16/03/2023,"Super well placed ... center of Lagos 10 min walk. Ponta da Piedade 20 min walk. Walk from the tip to Lagos, or from the tip to Porto de Mos on foot. 14 euros per day without electricity with a dog, 2.50/day for electricity. the campsite is very rustic...deserves a big renovation...but when it is done, and given the location, the prices will increase"
23149,2608633,4,Excalibur157,13/03/2023,Camping almost directly in town. Everything easy to reach. Good starting point for boat and hiking tours. Camping fulfills its purpose. Something all mixed up but ok.
23149,2607615,3,ZimmermannE.,12/03/2023,"Very well located.. you can walk to everything. Hot showers are available. It's all very old, but for the price you can't say anything."
23149,2606792,4,clausthomsen,12/03/2023,The campsite is perfectly located within walking distance of both the beach and town. Very friendly service and cleaning several times a day. Those of you who are not satisfied with the service buildings can use what you have in the camper.
23149,2604113,4,Fafa4425,09/03/2023,"Basic campsite with pitches under tall trees. Quiet and possible to walk to the beach and the city center. Clean toilets. Not finding possible locations in the city, it suited us"

it looks worse than it is.

but it's better than trying to fit in at Lidl or Pingo Dolce..."
23149,2587554,3,Van4life64,22/02/2023,"Very friendly welcome. The price of 14€ with electricity is reasonable. The toilets are clean. Very basic campsite which could be improved on several aspects but which does the job: quiet night, hot shower, 6A electricity, toilets, washing machine, water drain and toilet. For one or two nights near the center and the beaches, it's great!"
23149,2587060,1,dorsetian,22/02/2023,Drove in and straight out. Looked more like a shanty town. Overcrowded and very scruffy. There can be no reason to keep the only town centre camp looking like this apart from the fact there is no competition. We moved to the Orbitur camp which needs a bus ride into town but is at least habitable.
23149,2584516,2,Sunshine04,20/02/2023,"The place is neglected and a lot is damaged. But everything still works. Suitable for a few nights, but not for a vacation!"

23149,2580929,2,nandjgocamping,17/02/2023,Very well situated for a visit to Lagos. Owner is friendly and efficient. Parking is a free for all so is very untidy. Access to ehu points not possible for all. Sanitary facilities old but clean. Price is fair for the location and facilities. For us it was OK for one night but we wouldn't stay longer.

23149,2570237,3,awalber,06/02/2023,We cannot understand the negative reviews at all. We feel very comfortable here. Only the entrance area could use some tidying up and sweeping. Otherwise everything ok. Clean and hot showers. We'll definitely stay a few more days
23149,2566251,2,reisender06,02/02/2023,"Not nice. Dark, old and unkempt. The plus point is the location to the old town and the great Praias. Paid 11.50 euros without electricity."
23149,2564958,4,KatlinJohanson,31/01/2023,Wanted to leave as soon as we arrived but gave it a chance and ended up staying for almost two weeks. Bathrooms are cleaned twice a day except on Sundays. The people living in the tents with dogs are really nice and polite.

OK it's not expensive, 12.5€ for one night for 1 van, 1 person and 1 dog electricity, but it's still too expensive, even if it helps"
23149,2532212,2,Gezeitenstrom,29/12/2022,"good location clean showers. Space should not have been renovated for 100 years, operators are estimated to be of a similar age. Even the guests are adjusting with their rusted cars. Quite entertaining and you automatically keep your distance. However, 15 euros is a bit too expensive for this show."
23149,2528975,4,bk1967,26/12/2022,Ideal location for walking to Lagos old town and Ponta da Piedade. We didn't use the sanitary facilities. Don't understand the many negative comments. The place is better than any large city car park where you would stand tightly packed. Here are large trees that provide shade.
23149,2524945,4,RotecGo,20/12/2022,"The only option in Lagos, sanitary facilities outdated but clean, a few permanent guests. The first impression is worse than what it is then. Close to town and beach. In 200m a Spar with washing machines."

23149,2508627,1,giulieluca,29/11/2022,Only available unfortunately. Old and dirty bathrooms and it's not even that cheap. Few columns for electricity and distant. Good location to reach the town on foot in ten minutes.

The water in the showers is very hot, it's nice! People live year-round, kind and courteous. Very calm night. There are acorns falling on the roof at this time, it may come as a surprise. I was apprehensive in view of certain opinions, in the end I would come back!"

The younger one can speak English well, the older gentleman not so much, but you can make yourself understood. The location is great and I really recommend it. We were also able to sleep well and there was no noise at night (Saturday-Monday)"
23149,2506918,4,bluesman42,27/11/2022,"2nd time coming here. Cool campsite, but there will always be complainers accustomed to 5 stars. €24 for 48 hours of parking 5 minutes from old Lagos and the beaches. Water, drainage, sanitary, electricity, all included. Try to find a better place to park your 7 meters in town. I'll be back"
23149,2503328,2,ams1111,23/11/2022,Two stars for location. Close to the nice beach and the cozy old town. The campsite has most of it. Free shower. But don't have high expectations. Everything is old and worn. And there are MANY old wagons with a lot of scrap and rubbish outside. Many strange personalities actually live in these sheds. It is strange that the campsite allows this. Very devastating impression of the place.
23149,2502363,2,B.Niebroek,21/11/2022,"The only good thing about this campsite is the location, you can walk to the old town, beach and shops close by. The campsite is run down, neglected. The places, the sanitary should be completely renewed. Cars drove through the gate until late because it was still open. and when the gate finally closed, it was still noisy. The night porter did not appear."

Check out at 1 p.m. Paid €11.50 for 1 night for 2 adults and 1 camper without electricity. We would come again.
23149,2500599,2,mugje023,20/11/2022,the stars are for the location because it is top notch. the campsite itself is dirty and very outdated. lots of weird drunk people and the receptionist is very grumpy
23149,2499021,4,BrigitteMorgenstern,18/11/2022,"Were here for 10 days, then €12.75 per night. A bit old but OK. Is very central to town and beaches."
23149,2498031,2,catre37,17/11/2022,"Dilapidated campsite from reception to pitches and sanitary facilities. Dirty, moldy trailers that haven't moved in a long time. it is the only place to stop in Lagos apart from the parking prohibited at night for motorhomes for the most part. only positive point if we disregard the state, the toilets are cleaned. What contempt for motorhomes in Lagos!"
23149,2497495,3,cyrilLmrr,16/11/2022,"Really..:: very spartan. The premises, the toilets, the pitches... but not expensive, the minimum is there and very very well placed. 5 min from the historic center and 5 min from the promenade towards the Ponta da Pietade. For one night…it's ok."
23149,2492559,2,turtur944,12/11/2022,"Maximum 1-2 star standard, sanitary facilities stink, are dark and very outdated, like the entire place. Location is ok if you want to walk to the very nice beaches or to town. It was borderline for one night. checkout until 1 p.m. that might be good for one or the other."
23149,2490428,4,karoe611,11/11/2022,"Great location, a few minutes walk to the city center, to beautiful sandy beaches, the great Lagos Zoo is nearby. Great cycling routes to the Ponta da Piedade. There is a great, inexpensive local restaurant right next to the campsite, and across the street is a delicious burger shop, also with vegan burgers."
23149,2487816,4,TomaszSoplica,08/11/2022,The standard is not very high but its cheap. Location is great. No toilet paper or seats in the stalls. Great for a night or two if you want to stay in the center of Lagos.
23149,2483717,4,blacas,05/11/2022,"Super campsite to visit the old town and the port 5 mins walk and with all amenities. The sanitary facilities are a bit dated but they are clean and there are some everywhere. Personally I recommend. For the price it is quite adequate because of the location and the services. Icing on the cake, excellent restaurant at the entrance to the car park"
23149,2459088,3,monicapark,23/10/2022,"In three with the light we paid 18 euros! Of course the campsite is a bit dated but in a good location, 10 minutes from the center and the small streets! Hot water without problems!"
23149,2458183,1,Mangos,23/10/2022,"Worst campsite we have ever come to. Dirty and smelly toilets and showers. Everything came down. That they still ask for money. plague of flies! We left after 2 hours, although we had already paid for one night, but we didn't care."
23149,2452225,2,Schnitti1959,19/10/2022,Good location but showing its age. Fine for one night.
23149,2440156,1,willspinetti,12/10/2022,Friendly welcome. Good location. Poor cleaning of the bathrooms. Apparently many residents live in tents. The places are not demarcated and people misuse two spaces making it difficult to find a good place. I only stayed because it was late to get on the road and it was the only place allowed to sleep.
23149,2438168,1,toldi,11/10/2022,"There is only one thing, keep going. The square conveys an asocial milieu. Many ancient campers are standing around. Maybe from permanent campers. Disastrous toilets. We're moving on to a more pleasant place."
23149,2436470,2,SENTIER25,10/10/2022,Really to troubleshoot.
23149,2433147,4,larsylinn,09/10/2022,Great campsite. The location is perfect! Close to the beach and the center. We paid 11.50 per night without electricity. Sanitary could be better but doable for 2/3 nights
23149,2427859,3,jaye,06/10/2022,"Okay for one night, free choice of space, would recommend parking as close to the entrance as possible, the further you drive to the site, the crazier people camp there (some apparently permanently)"
23149,2408029,1,SteFranZoe,27/09/2022,"The place was awful. The sanitary facilities were not clean and they smelled extremely. The tiles in the showers are already falling off the walls. It's all extremely old. The places themselves are ok, but there are some mobile homes there that have been there for a very long time and creepy characters live in them. Some of the pitches are too small and you half stand on them with your neighbors."
23149,2385651,1,Wetzsulvoye,19/09/2022,"Flagrant lack of hygiene and maintenance from the reception to the toilets, not to mention the many dilapidated pitches occupied year-round in extremely precarious conditions. Only the proximity of the city and the beach is appreciable in this campsite."
23149,2383465,4,ea5bwr,18/09/2022,"Only place in Lagos, apart from the motorhome area next to the soccer field and in front of the Police. However, its location is perfect. The plots are not delimited, so some users use more space than they should. Shims necessary for leveling in some areas. I saw the toilets cleaned 2 days in a row. Nice reception staff."
23149,2381272,2,LuisS.,17/09/2022,"Camping of motorhomes, camper and tents. One night in a motorhome €17.50, €2.50 with electricity. The facilities are quite improvable, outdated, without limiting the plots. Settlement of fixed campers throughout the facility, some not pleasing to the eye. The only campsite in the area, that's why it is saved."
23149,2378235,3,alinebeaupain,16/09/2022,"Perfect for spending a night. Ideally located. The mr at the reception speaks French. Sanitary clean, but smelly. All the same, be careful to close your vehicle properly because security leaves something to be desired."
23149,2363098,1,charlitos,11/09/2022,"I honestly don't know where to start…just don't go! We have lasted 5 minutes inside and we have left, total lack of control in plots, people sleeping on the ground, without shops, caravans that have been there for years without opening, dirty, expensive, lots of crap everywhere, the camping area I think they have sleeping there for months is a shame as it is open! I see it totally unhealthy"
23149,2361116,4,nicelnic123,11/09/2022,"All in all good place.Perfect location for beautiful beaches,5 mins walk to nearest and 20 to furthest,Spar 100m away,bars and restaurants next door.Free choice of pitches,some reckless then of course stand across 3 pitches..lots of sinks , large showers and many toilets. But unpleasant smells and could be cleaner. 19€ the night all inclusive :)"
23149,2350174,4,SonnItaly,07/09/2022,"Campsite in an excellent location for the city of Lagos, about 5/10 min walk. Also great for beaches. 5 minutes the closest. Near market. Older campsite but fully functional. Hot showers included. Friendly and helpful staff."
23149,2340318,1,IVECODAILY1991,05/09/2022,"Place with a good location to visit the student beach and others, but very dirty, unhealthy bathrooms, the reception smells of sweat, you have to find the place yourself (they don't keep track of whether or not they have more space). Paid showers (wear flip flops seems not cleaned daily and possibility of fungus)."
23149,2340027,1,Ferdl99,04/09/2022,"I (male) was told the place was full. When my girlfriend went back to the reception 2 minutes later and asked, there was suddenly a seat available. I find it cheeky! In itself the site is in a good location for visiting Lagos and the pitches are good. But the sanitary facilities are neglected and smelly, and only some of the showers are warm."
23149,2338718,4,miundleni,04/09/2022,"The campsite is okay! Not nearly as catastrophic as some describe it, but not a brilliant performance either. Yes, the toilets stink, the facility is showing its age and the floor is dusty. But the atmosphere is relaxed, people are nice and we felt safe. Paid €16.50 with a van (2 people) and without electricity and thought the price was okay :)"
23149,2330115,1,wilal,01/09/2022,"Wanted to spend the night here, but after walking around the campsite, looking for a place, we quickly left. It looked dirty, there was trash everywhere. It stunk. caravans. tents, everything was criss-cross. We were not happy about it."
23149,2325091,4,angi0223,31/08/2022,"Campsite is very central, the facility is a bit over the years. Otherwise had a very good stay."
23149,2323239,1,parknight1731,30/08/2022,"no delimited places so a little crowded, rubbish everywhere, gutted trash cans, dirty toilets. Home not friendly, a wifi charged 3 euros per day and which does not work. Unfortunately the only possible spot to see Lagos and the beaches since the parking of motorhomes is prohibited everywhere"
23149,2322806,3,MarikaS.,30/08/2022,"good location but noisy due to music in the bars. sandy soil everywhere, everything dusty. Otherwise for a night in to explore lagos"
23149,2313760,2,oscargz,28/08/2022,Well located and acceptable bathrooms/showers. There are no plots and people park crowded together.
23149,2307466,5,cliziaborgo,27/08/2022,"the campsite is in a great location in the center and close to the beaches. with a camper and two parsons with electricity we paid € 19 per night. hot showers, clean bathrooms. recommended!"
23149,2304546,3,AmbraB,26/08/2022,"you have to be a bit open in view to come to this campsite but it is in the center of Lagos and close to the most beautiful beaches. Old but very clean toilets, hot showers. There are few places you have to be lucky. very polite and friendly staff. Being in the center there is everything you need within walking distance."
23149,2290230,5,Chille22,23/08/2022,"excellent place to spend one or several nights! very demanded, always full, in a week it is the 2nd time we are here and without a doubt I do not recommend another one here in lagos! close to beaches supermarkets etc, WC could be cleaner and showers only cold water, otherwise everything perfect! The reception guys, a 10 for them!"
23149,2262699,4,p4nmanu,18/08/2022,"The campsite does not look very inviting. In the end, however, everything went well. Very good location in town. Arrival in the high season recommended only from the afternoon. We paid €19 for one night (campervan, 2 people, electricity)."
23149,2261862,4,lianeandsven42,18/08/2022,Very close to the old town of Lagos as well as the famous Roman bridge and Ponta da Piedade. You can easily walk there. The toilets and showers are clean as well. It’s all just a little bit old but totally fine for a few nights. You should come early as the camping ground is not that big.
23149,2261307,3,baprazerea,18/08/2022,"Nice place in the center of Lagos. This space provide water for the cars, and showers. They don’t have a good spaces with trees but more open spaces that come the sun all the time .."
23149,2252094,3,claratomschi,16/08/2022,the campsite is okay for spending a night or two in lagos. the sanitary facilities stink. in the high season it is very crowded. also a little noisy. electricity is expensive.
23149,2249639,1,BATAHOLA,16/08/2022,"Appalling. The plots without good delimitation. All very seedy, as if it were a hippy plan, and I think that plan would be better. I don't know how it can be classified as camping. The streets are very narrow. The rubber to fill plugged in the sink, the almost non-existent services, and on top of that queue to enter, because the only good thing is the situation. The reception closes at 5, and you can check out until 4…"
23149,2240980,5,Fabulous51,15/08/2022,"Well located campsite with beautiful beaches and close to the city center. The toilets are clean, there is a bar, it is quiet. We stayed 3 days to enjoy Lagos."
23149,2232912,3,FloreDelou,14/08/2022,Aire a bit rough. Expensive for the services offered. Everyone does what they can. Close to beach and town center on foot. Only spot in Lagos so we take. Nice the concept of subsidizing the local football club.
23149,2195170,4,LJanson,08/08/2022,Were skeptical because the place is not rated well. Great location for going into town. It takes 5 minutes. Really perfect. Old sanitary facilities but clean. That is and more important as new. The price is already expensive (19 including electricity / night) but really ok for 1 or 2 nights.
23149,2193397,3,AS095,07/08/2022,Stayed 1 night here. The women's toilets were fairly clean. Men's toilets turned out to be filthy. No toilet paper available. Showers were fine. Someone almost parked his car against our camper so we couldn't sit outside. Center within walking distance.
23149,2170811,1,park4nightrebew111,04/08/2022,"Simple, no toilet seat, toilets smelly and not clean, little shade, wifi costs 6€ and doesn't work, close to the city center, costs for camper van including electricity 57€ for 3 nights."
23149,2169205,1,Bartolino1606,03/08/2022,"We canceled again, which worked very well. On the one hand, the conditions were catastrophic, dirty, and there was no real parking space for our mobile home. Despite that, it was ok. We are traveling with a small child and it is not suitable for that. The barbed wire on the high walls was a deterrent. It would be a shame Top €19/night was not worth it. It should have some comfort and atmosphere"
23149,2162612,4,KriyaVan,02/08/2022,"Spent 2 nights (38€ for 2 people + van) here, very close to the city. The 1st night was pretty quiet & the 2nd there were people playing music  (louder, but acceptable), chill vibes, hot water, nice facilities (but no toilet paper though) + electricity"
23149,2156711,4,sarahdawes,01/08/2022,perfectly fine for 1 night in the area to be able to walk to the beaches and into town very easily. showers and toilets were clean. electric also great. getting a shady spot sometimes challenging as some longer term campers take two spots. overal perfect for a stay in lagos.
23149,2145785,1,RosaCarvalho,30/07/2022,"I do not recommend. Dirty park and without the minimum conditions. We went in, we were there for 1h and we left again. We ended up looking for another park to spend the night."
23149,2139743,4,henry2110,29/07/2022,Very good location. Town and beach are within walking distance. Price ok too. We paid with 2 people. and campers for 2 days 33€. Sanitary facilities are not the newest but sufficient. Place overall clean and tidy.
23149,2139667,3,mariemauro,29/07/2022,"Three stars for the location: very close to the beach and the center, both within walking distance, and next to the bus stop and supermarket. A bit dated campsite, bathrooms not always tidy."
23149,2093442,4,chelina237,19/07/2022,"Stayed 2 nights and find the campsite outdated but perfectly adequate! Sanitary facilities ok. Great location - 15 mins walk to Ponte da Piedade, town & beach! :) very helpful staff!"

23149,2084960,2,quentinricard,17/07/2022,"spend a night here because it is impossible to 'bivouac' around the city because the police distribute almonds of 120 euros with a vengeance, the campsite is really dirty, I am not drawing you a picture but it is better to avoid go to the toilet down there, 16 euro per night for a not flat location and stick one on top of the other."
23149,2081790,4,Jona-E,16/07/2022,"Good camping, close to the center, you can walk in a few minutes and good atmosphere. A bit dated but everything worked perfectly and was clean. Quite cheap price, 2 nights with van 2 people electricity €38 I don't understand the complaints of some, if you are looking for luxury you have to go somewhere else and pay much more."
23149,2075234,5,Antscha,15/07/2022,"For us the best campsite!! Were on the road for 3 weeks and came back again after a week. Alternatively, pleasant people, close to the beach and downtown. Would always come back."

23149,2060063,5,HannahMercedesL319,11/07/2022,Very nice campsite. Great location. The plumbing is like everywhere in Portugal. Run down but clean. There is a very cozy atmosphere at the campsite! We recommend it.
23149,2016814,2,ChrisNoor,27/06/2022,"only  camping site in the region, so  not really  a choice. it is very  simple.  location in town  is good.  there  is no  view, staff not very helpful  or friendly,  sanitair ok but  not  well  kept. not worth  the 23 euro's so we left the next Day.
graat pizza around the corner."

The sanitary facilities are old, but OK. Not a place to stay, but a good stopover as it is walking distance to town or to a nearby beach. €16.50/night (2 people and a T6 without electricity)"
23149,1992237,4,BerndRudde,19/06/2022,"Not nearly as bad as often mentioned! A bit run down but clean and perfect for visiting the city! In addition, with €16.50 (2 people plus camper) very cheap!"

23149,1974159,3,park4nightBAD,13/06/2022,"It depends what you expect. My rating: location 5/5 stars, sanitary facilities 1/5 stars, value for money 4/5 stars (€16.50 for 1 night in the T6 with 2 people), suitability for families: 1/5 stars. Yes, of course, a lot would have to be invested here to upgrade the place. I would definitely not do family camping here. It's ok for 1 night."
23149,1971920,1,FamilieGeiger,12/06/2022,"Despite the bad reviews, we wanted to give the place a chance because the location is really great. But no. It's really a shame and beyond sad the state this place is in. It belongs completely renewed…. Pity"

And if your problem is the people working here don’t speak your language then I’m sorry but you are in their country so why should they. People working behind the reception were sound no problems atall with this place"
23149,1965982,2,SallysCamping,11/06/2022,run down place. Dusty. Sanitary facilities old but clean. Ok for 1-2 nights to visit Lagos. downtown very close.

23149,1960586,4,Karlchen_Camper,09/06/2022,"despite the many negative reviews, we headed for this place. The place is better than most comments suggest, but of course not a star campsite. It's always a question of your own requirements. We are looking for places to legally spend the night with our mini camper. Toilet and shower are still important to us. All this was fulfilled here at a reasonable price (14€)."
23149,1957517,3,geclo,07/06/2022,"Better than what the comments suggested Decent welcome Old-fashioned but clean sanitary facilities Prefer pitches at the bottom and in the middle, at the top a little gloomy Very quiet night €19 A 2-person van with electricity Interesting location for visiting the center"
23149,1953951,4,hendrikpeekel,06/06/2022,"Basically better than the reviews mostly left here! Highly recommended as a short stopover. The surrounding beaches can be easily reached from here. Also perfectly located for an evening visit to the city center! The sanitary facilities were better than expected. Showers are great, toilets ok. Ambiance can be expanded, so a small deduction."
23149,1953160,1,dandre,06/06/2022,very unpleasant reception make no effort for the French language and if you are not happy you can leave otherwise poorly maintained campsite
23149,1941966,1,cyladel,03/06/2022,"Ah yes, apart from the fact that this one is very close to the city center there is nothing attractive, a fairly high price, no limitation of plots, more than old-fashioned sanitary facilities, dust everywhere. Good for one night but it's really the maximum."
23149,1932427,1,paabloviedo,30/05/2022,"He scored it with a star for putting something and for the good location it has. Now from there to call this site ""camping"" is enough. Lousy facilities. The bathrooms are scary to enter. I do not recommend it."

Unfortunately, the staff is very rude and they didn't want to open the electricity box for us... The location alone is worth going there. In about 10 minutes directly to the beautiful Algarve. There are also many delicious restaurants nearby"
23149,1922720,3,bryanrimondi,27/05/2022,"excellent price for the location (13 € for two adults, a dog and a van) near the center and near the lighthouse, halfway between both. the campsite is divided into three terraces, use the services of the middle terrace which are the ""best"" of all. those on the first terrace have no hot water from the showers. all in all for one night you can definitely do it."

23149,1894621,4,gvweber,16/05/2022,"We paid €11.50 per night for 2 people without electricity. We were also quite satisfied, for the price you shouldn't expect too much. The toilets weren't that good, but the showers were great. The receptionist is very friendly and accommodating."
23149,1888094,2,liliane32,13/05/2022,"Friendly welcome. On the other hand, the state of the campsite is more than mediocre. Stinky toilets. Nauseous odors at times But we are on vacation and therefore passing through. When there are people who live year-round, do we have the right to complain? Positive points the proximity of the city, the beaches. Nice walk by bike or on foot on the heights with viewpoints. Peaceful night."

Reception very friendly and professional; Sanitary old but well maintained. V/E also ok. Bad: some neglected looking caravans, a large ruined building next to the site. For 1-2 nights ok."
23149,1880023,3,Symba01,09/05/2022,Has the merit of existing. Very average reception. General impression of dilapidation. Very old but clean toilets. Close to town and the road to Ponta de Piedade. The two nights we stayed were quiet.
23149,1874209,1,french_driver,07/05/2022,"Unfriendly at the reception, space getting old, we didn't even use the sanitary facilities (dirty & broken). Should be seen more as a parking lot, unfortunately there is no competition in the corner. Were only there one night."
23149,1872805,4,mightymaik,06/05/2022,Absolutely fine for 1-2 days. Washing facilities are clean. Advantage: 10 minutes walk to the beach and 15 minutes to the old town. Therefore 4 stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️
23149,1870322,4,catetphiphi50,04/05/2022,we appreciated this campsite with regard to its proximity to the city center and the superb beaches with regard to its price. at ease with people who live in tents to each their own means to live as decently as possible without bringing criticism
23149,1869836,3,arno252,04/05/2022,"Positives: not far from the beach and the city center, quiet at night even with lots of people. Negative points: clean water filling with the same tap as the cassette, wifi 3€ for a single device and very slow, dilapidated showers, limited reception."
23149,1863754,4,JPeterH,01/05/2022,Yes the place is older. But the facilities are ok and clean. Well the old hotel ruin disturbs. But the location is central. It doesn't get any better than that. Old town near POI near. And for van 5.40 without electricity with all services it 35€ for 4 nights. So great
23149,1843800,4,Josla,21/04/2022,"Large pitches on firm sand, separated by trees and bushes. Quiet in the upper area. Looks a bit neglected, but the sanitary facilities are very clean and space is only 600 m from the center of the old town and 300 m from a great beach Alternative to visit Lagos."
23149,1835169,4,camu9192,18/04/2022,"Well, lower your expectations a bit - great location"
23149,1829179,1,MathieuEniovala,16/04/2022,Only campsite on Lagos. Dirty. I do not recommend at all..
23149,1818100,1,michaelmichael,12/04/2022,visited this place just for a look.Very untidy rubbish festival going on.Lots of vans under old tarpaulin sheets.Builders vans and what looked like abandoned vehicles about.Not pleasant at all but there's a big lack of parking in Lagos..Stay elsewhere outside the town if possible .
23149,1817433,4,connorontour,12/04/2022,"A very centrally located campsite. Not a beauty, but not as bad as the comments here would suggest. We have extended the stay."
23149,1813095,2,Lotterleben,10/04/2022,Very strange...... there are many long-term campers and tents that are well past their prime. At three in the morning drunken fights. Some of the living space is scattered around the long-term residents…. We didn't feel comfortable. We didn't test the sanitary facilities. The only plus is the proximity to the city.
23149,1811162,2,Mssmaris,08/04/2022,"Place has really seen the best of days. People seem to live there in tents aswell and the road is very busy, along the campsite. Someone on the site started screaming and yelling on the site at night (prob drunk?) so felt awkward.. the one main wonderful thing is that it is very very close to town and the gorgeous beaches."
23149,1804759,3,surcouf35,03/04/2022,"We stayed there for two nights, perfect for visiting the city and its surroundings on foot. We paid for two 14 euros per day with electricity, hot showers included in the price, so even if at first glance the place is not engaging, the toilets are very well maintained. The people at the reception friendly, and we slept very well."
23149,1802933,4,unbekannter,01/04/2022,"is not the ""most glamorous"" place, but close to town and beach. The showers and toilets are clean and hot. 3 people, 1 bus, 1 tent with electricity for 21 euros. The price for the location is great, if you only want 5 star places, you should go somewhere else."
23149,1795894,4,oldman65xxl,26/03/2022,"Don't be put off, the place is fine. The wash house upstairs is the better one. Friendly staff. Close to the old town. This invites you to stroll through the streets. Lots of cafes and restaurants. A hike by the sea along the beaches from Praia da Batata to the Ponte da Piedade is also interesting and very beautiful. The trees should be severely cut back. WLAN, with 3, - too expensive."
23149,1786446,3,KNAUSi_2,18/03/2022,It's true: the place needs to be renovated. but: hot water in the showers and very close to town. it's cheap too. reasonably good seats upstairs.
23149,1784430,1,jesusvillar,15/03/2022,"we were there yesterday at noon and the receptionist was very rude and not at all cooperative, when we asked him if there was room he told us that we would look and when we asked him about the price he told us there are the brochures with which we left and went to park next to the station buses for 3 euros all day and to sleep to the stadium which is quieter"
23149,1780833,3,fayJamart,12/03/2022,We were worried after reading the bad reviews but it was absolutely fine. The toilets are a bit old and we didn't have a shower but it's very near the old town. We found a good spot for our campervan looking out over the football field and it was very comfortable and quiet. If you're hoping to go out for a drink in town in the evening then it's a perfect spot. staff were kind and easy going!
23149,1759011,1,kenandjane,18/02/2022,"Avoid, avoid, avoid! Dreadful, dirty, scruffy and unkempt! Two very sullen guys at reception that took everything they had to even greet us, let alone offer local information. Find an alternative, would be my advice!"
23149,1758054,3,mirtheandfou,17/02/2022,"The reviews make you think that this is a dilapidated refugee camp. Undoubtedly not the most luxurious campsite, but for €11.50 per night for 2 people and a camper without electricity in the middle of the city it was more than fine. Sanitary old but clean. Remarkably quiet at the moment. We stayed 4 nights."
23149,1750222,2,PhilippeetFrancoise,07/02/2022,"at first glance it's scary, old-fashioned campsite with permanent residents who live in tents, outdated motorhomes and caravans in ruins that gives a bad image of the campsite. the sanitary facilities are also outdated. Average staff, average price, for average services. only the location is OK."
23149,1747262,2,Barbaradu35,04/02/2022,"Honestly, only stop at this campsite if you really need to take a hot shower... For the rest, we have the feeling that the equipment has been there since 1980! Too bad because the location is pretty good"
23149,1744431,1,skoolie_and,30/01/2022,"We paid €20.50 for our large bus, 2 dogs and two people with electricity. Relatively expensive, but the campsite has the flair of a homeless shelter. 10€ a night would be fair..."
23149,1742099,4,albjaeger,27/01/2022,"Perfect location in the middle of the city and yet quiet; getting old but clean; no rubbish, the sanitary facilities are clean; everything available nearby (Spar shop)"
23149,1739808,4,Annemarie85,23/01/2022,"Location is great, close to both the beach and the city centre. Facilities are old, but clean. Many “permanent guests” which gives the place a special vibe, but all the people we talked to were very friendly. Spacious for a campsite in the city centre, with lots of trees."
23149,1728667,3,huanag,07/01/2022,"1 camper, 2 adults + electricity 16 eur/ night. Washmashine 4 eur. Internet costs extra. Some of the showers have mold, toilet has no paper or soap. Its pretty nice atmosphere though, not as ”stiff” as an ordinary campsite."
23149,1721459,3,saskiaisabella,31/12/2021,"Honestly friends, it's perfectly fine for the money. The toilets were really awful and we didn't use them, but the showers, sinks and sinks were very clean. Campsite with sand / earth and the parking bays with bushes somewhat hidden from view. It was an experience to be able to sleep peacefully without GNR. 10 minutes walk to the center. Animals allowed."
23149,1715716,3,Vingaardvanlife,25/12/2021,"for the price it was pretty nice.
facilities are ok. we parked on up the hill, and there is some nasty stones that we had to drive over to get in on the pitch, but otherwise everything was good. we actually had really low expectations after reading the reviews here, and were positive surprised. nice owners, ok toilet(smells a bit, but clean), nice vibe on the site, and perfect location :)"
23149,1710453,4,SietskeIm,15/12/2021,"Great location to visit the city centre and very decent price; €11,50 for 2 adults without electricity."
23149,1708163,4,MitMichel,11/12/2021,"I fully agree with the previous entry, except that we only had to pay 12 euros per night for the mobile home, 2 people and electricity. Once you've got used to it, the space is pretty good."
23149,1707880,3,openend2020,10/12/2021,"The sanitary facilities are old, but they were always clean. We used the back ones on the 2nd level. The first shower on the right was also ok there. Environment not nice, but calm. Great location: 10 minutes on foot to the city, hike along the spectacular rocky coast to the lighthouse directly from the square. Shops (Spar) 5 minutes away in the direction of the city. 2 people including electricity 14 euros"
23149,1706390,1,pedroparejo,08/12/2021,"It is not worth what you pay, you do not use the facilities because of dirty and neglected. I do not advise it, before paying you have to see it because they do not return the money."
23149,1700308,4,WillemijnSiebbeles,29/11/2021,"Great campsite with friendly people. Spacious places and super located. A bit old indeed, but no problem! Very good stay here!"
23149,1696069,5,peaktravelling,22/11/2021,"Despite all the negative comments, we have been fine here. Facilities are not the latest no. It smells musty when you shower. Also very friendly staff, good English speaking at the reception. There is a restaurant around the corner. And the best location to walk into town and walk onto the beach! Would take the top, back field, there was enough space, you stand quietly and there was a good atmosphere."
23149,1695121,3,ruggedroadtrips,21/11/2021,Nice staff with good English and the location and the price are great! But the campsite is getting on in years and the sanitary facilities don't look so great anymore. There is also no soap and no toilet paper. I looked at the showers from afar and decided to take a shower at the next campsite tomorrow.
23149,1679824,3,SaraNeha,06/11/2021,"In the end we did not sleep in why it did not stop raining, but we entered and saw that it was very small and with many trees. It is in the center of town and next to the routes to the lighthouse. very good location"
23149,1677245,2,marekp2310,04/11/2021,"Dirty place, too expensive for its services. The only benefit is the location in the city centre."
23149,1675771,2,Mue2020,03/11/2021,"Great location, but the place itself is old and crumbling. The sanitary facilities are cleaned and immediately afterwards it smells fresh, but after a short time the old smell comes back because everything is damp and old. It drips in when it rains. The ceiling is suspiciously dark. I didn't shower here. Everything rancid. No warm water for washing up. No recommendation."
23149,1673254,1,pillowsontheroad,01/11/2021,"Ok, the beaches are spectacular and close to the camping but the surrounding real estate, holiday appartements and hotels are a disgrace. The camping itself is completely worn down and the owners don’t seem to care. Stay away from this place."
23149,1671714,3,baydreamer,31/10/2021,"Worn down camping, gave it 3 stars due to the location! Short walk to the old town! I have seen  many parking lots that has been more tidy!"
23149,1665247,4,Geefeconomie,27/10/2021,"We were hesitant to go here (especially with the kids), but decided to give it a change! And we didn’t regret. Perfect location. But also on the campground it was fine: warm showers, lot of shade, enough space to get water and empty our toilet, we felt save. We stayed 3 quiet nights. 2 adults, 2 kids (5&2yo), 1 dog, without electricity: €16 per night."
23149,1663708,2,RyanHoppe,26/10/2021,"""Interesting"" place, with outdated infrastructure. Sockets on the opposite side of the path, black water disposal here, gray water disposal in another place and where you can get fresh water I never called out. But a big advantage is the proximity to the beach and the center. In addition, the place is safe. 10/24/21 to 10/26/21"
23149,1656433,2,Rafa58,22/10/2021,"More than camping, it seems like an area with the right to take tables and an awning, the showers without hot water, the best is central to visit the town, the cliffs and beaches."
23149,1656006,4,DebbyCtH,21/10/2021,"This campsite has a perfect location. Close to the beach and town. The campsite is old and not very well maintained. But the price of € 13 per night is in balance with what you get. Sanitary is clean and reasonable. We had a nice pitch with shade almost all day. Don't expect luxury, but a place where you can safely leave your camper"
23149,1655364,3,Horst0815,21/10/2021,"Location perfect. Sufficient for a couple of nights. Not far to the beach, port, supermarket (Spar), center. Various restaurants and bars in the immediate vicinity. Various boat tours at the harbor possible (with us 15eur per person to the caves and grottos). Hop on hop off day ticket for 5eur, 9 stops are approached every hour, always on time."
23149,1643370,5,wildparker,13/10/2021,Camping like 30 years ago. Nice!
23149,1632607,1,waldo98,08/10/2021,We entered and left a little surprised by the poor condition of the very neglected and dirty campsite. There seem to be people living there. It's a shame because the situation is unbeatable.
23149,1626717,3,lyceo38,04/10/2021,"Campsite well located in the heart of the city, large, well-defined and more pleasant spaces towards the entrance to the campsite (a little gloomy environment above), dilapidated sanitary facilities, especially those at the bottom. Correct for one step."
23149,1624970,5,tieskeheijl,03/10/2021,"Well located campsite, everything within walking distance. nice spacious places with shade. sanitary outdated but chrome. with hot water. we will come back for sure"
23149,1623016,2,philbo942,02/10/2021,"Very good location, but narrow paths especially for large mobile homes. Old sanitary facilities and space generally not that comfortable."
23149,1621129,4,flosspops,01/10/2021,"Great site but the facilities  are old & tired but clean with good hot showers & washing machine and cheap bar .5 mins walk to town & beach with great restaurants , shops and bars  we would definitely return ."
23149,1613564,5,FlummiM,28/09/2021,Pretty nice camping. Close to beaches and the city. Good and clean bathroom. Good price. Possibilty to stay under trees. Best place to stay in that area.
23149,1594293,3,satekip,20/09/2021,"Great place. We stayed here mainly for electricity, water replenishment and chemical toilet. That's all possible. Paid €19.00 for the camper + electricity. Close to the centre! Furthermore, the toilet / shower areas were not very clean, but hot water. Fine, also because there are few places. In Lagos are where you can park for free."
23149,1583072,3,RolfGrotegut,16/09/2021,"The location is perfect, you can quickly walk to the city and the sea. The parking spaces partly under trees, everything simple but good. The wash houses are horrible, but everything works somehow."
23149,1582117,4,klaus14513,16/09/2021,"The place is certainly not comparable to a great CP in Austria but it has everything you need, the city center 10 minutes on foot and several beaches between 5 and 15 minutes and that in one of the top locations in Lagos for 22 € with electricity. The places are shady and the shower time is unlimited, you don't get sick, don't worry. And yes, there is poverty here too."
23149,1579139,4,matou3185,14/09/2021,"Very quiet campsite, sanitary facilities, but very clean Large and shaded site Few people in this season Very well placed for hiking towards Ponda de Peidade or for visiting the city of Lagos Correct price 16.50 for a 7 m cc, without electricity"
23149,1572604,2,goutny,12/09/2021,Bof a little creepy preferred The places at the start otherwise good for the location
23149,1571800,4,Drelen,12/09/2021,"I do not understand comments about parking anywhere.  RV sites are clearly defined with logs, trees and bushes.  Easy to maneuver except at entrance.  Well run with 1300 checkout time.  Easy walk or bike ride to marina and old town."
23149,1560643,2,VanessaAlvarado,08/09/2021,"Excellent location, but quite improvable facilities. It gives a feeling that you have lived through better times. Old bathrooms, without toilet paper and the odd little bug. Good hot water with pressure. The center is within walking distance and the beach is the same. If they took care of it a little more it would be great."
23149,1560555,2,EM15,08/09/2021,"In the absence of options, it is necessary to confirm, negative notes: it is an old, dingy campsite, very dirty bathrooms and with a bad smell. Positive notes: central. One night motorhome two people and dog € 18"
23149,1536987,3,micheledeblasio,01/09/2021,"A fairly chaotic campsite, everyone is free to park wherever they want, obsolete but fairly clean services and tight maneuvering areas, all of which would need an energetic renovation. No, because the whole place is quiet, restaurants, supermarket, beaches and the city are very close, the owners are kind and tolerant. Euro 19 per day, The services are free. Highly recommended"
23149,1511712,3,gombar,25/08/2021,"Have..the best location !! You have to understand that it is not a business as such but rather it is a way to pay for the local soccer team ... a little neglected and with people living there ... we have gone to other more Pro and put up with every hustler ... and here we have been several times and zero problems is more, super quiet."
23149,1511535,1,sergijaneiro,25/08/2021,"The only good thing is the location. There are no defined plots, it looks like a shanty town. Little to add to the rest of the comments"
23149,1504314,1,Alain2169,23/08/2021,"Camping to flee, a real squat !! Dirty, unsanitary, nothing definite as a location. We took the tour in a motorhome and we left !! A shame.."
23149,1491565,1,kecorahe,21/08/2021,A fraud. Dirty and unsafe. They should not allow activity
23149,1488258,3,cabarryac,20/08/2021,"Well, what everyone says, very neglected, it seems at times a refugee camp since there are people who live there on their plot but being in the center, next to the area of bars and others is fine, there were families, young people and of all kinds, a good mix, if you are looking to leave the motorhome and go out into the city it is the best since you are in the center of the city."
23149,1487070,4,espositoassunta3,20/08/2021,"I leave 4 stars because for me it had everything I needed! Comfortable camping in the center, with the camper we had a great time the price is right and the bathrooms on the side of the campers were spotless !!! Obviously I have seen better campsites but also more expensive so if you are with a camper I absolutely recommend it!"
23149,1465228,1,JesuliTrafic,16/08/2021,"An absolute dirt unreformed campsite since it was inaugurated, services of pain, showers of pain and facilities of pain and pain where you stop in pure and hard land if there is a little air dust everywhere at night a Camper 2 people without light 16 ; 50, there are much more decent motorhome areas for less price that is not recommended."
23149,1464426,1,Zubel,16/08/2021,An absolute disaster. Old. No maintenance. The toilets would not pass a sanitary inspection. Lack of general hygiene.
23149,1463539,2,juanini,15/08/2021,"Everything can not have. And here we have a good location to walk to beaches and town, super etc. There is an absence of organization. Anarchy begins when you ask the receptionist who says you are looking for life. Two-seater vans. Tents in caravan areas. For the rest, I do not see so bad the area of toilets and sinks. 2 people, motorhome with light, € 19"
23149,1461680,1,irisova,15/08/2021,"As in the comments before: bordered by barbed wire fence, only a little shadow in front, the rest very shabby. Almost no privacy protection. The sanitary facilities are very shabby and we don't have high standards. Loud dog barking at night and noise from other guests, campsite owners tolerate that. The only advantage: close to the center."
23149,1457996,4,Mas518,14/08/2021,Camping in the center of Lagos 5 minutes from the beach. Economic.
23149,1449937,2,sansini,13/08/2021,"Great location near the center of Lagos, ok camping area with various shady areas, unfortunately dirty and old toilets and showers."
23149,1447793,3,neki9,12/08/2021,It is close to the beach. The pitches are not a big deal but hey is fine. The showers have not been able to put hot water. For a place of passage is fine. Economical for 19 euros 2 people and the motorhome with light included
23149,1433897,3,KaliforniaGorri,10/08/2021,"It stands out for its location, as it is excellent for both the town of Lagos and the nearby beaches. Economic price (19 euros, two adults, a camper and an elect). The toilets and showers were disgusting. The plots cast a lot of shade, but you can’t get nails into the ground."
23149,1431813,4,MikeLeBlue,10/08/2021,Old-fashioned camping the way we like them. Very friendly where everyone says hello. Good atmosphere. Ideally located in the center of Lagos. Close to magnificent unpaved beaches. Bar and cafeteria on site. Places in the shade under the eucalyptus trees. Price 19 € van 2 adults electricity. I highly recommend this step.
23149,1415651,3,bikefire,06/08/2021,"It is an old campsite, including the facilities, but it is located in the center of the city and that in Portugal is complicated. You have all the services and the beach is about 700 meters on one side and about 450 on the other steeper. The center and all the restaurants, bars, market, port, etc ... is about 5 minutes walking quietly. Good location but stay 2 days maximum."
23149,1410681,4,casper96,05/08/2021,Very calm and central to Lagos. A bit expensive but enables you to have a full day and enjoy Lagos.
23149,1397843,2,johnmcnroe,03/08/2021,"Very good location, close to beaches, but that's all. Expensive for what is offered, we felt like in a prison (barbed wire over the fences), old buildings and not refurbished or well maintained, ugly place in general. There are shadows, though."
23149,1387789,3,Marivivi,31/07/2021,Very good located a step away from beautiful beaches near the center on foot and the Marina area. It is a bit left. The location is great but could do with a little maintenance. Quite alternative atmosphere.
23149,1386978,4,Nicole553,31/07/2021,"Nice but basic campsite! A bit smaller and older but always clean! The beach and town are within walking distance, ideal. The cheapest campsite in Lagos! :)"
23149,1386227,4,meikegh,31/07/2021,"Super good location! The beaches and the city center can be reached on foot in 5 to 10 minutes. The place and the sanitary facilities were old, but very clean. You can tell that it has not been invested in the space for a long time, but if you don't mind, you will feel good :)"
23149,1372779,3,sinnickyquemas,27/07/2021,"It is a campsite to help local soccer children, it is not a district business. Clean toilets and showers too, but old and poorly maintained. Reception and goal correct treatment. There are some other characters that live in the campsite and you can see them walking but they are harmless (hahaha). I slept great and it is also downtown in 5 ', it is very well located"

The best location: beaches 5 min, ponta da piedade 20 and the center next door also walking, taking into account that you can not park almost anywhere on the coast in the Algarve with the motorhome is the only option :("
23149,1324820,3,JYE19,14/07/2021,Well located campsite near the center and 5 'from the beach. The treatment of the staff was correct. Old but clean toilets and showers. Pleasant smell of eucalyptus. It has a backyard air as a previous comment says. Too bad they don't invest a little bit in maintaining it. I would go back without a doubt.
23149,1312626,4,lucyanne,10/07/2021,"Reasonabley priced, slightly small camping spots but we just about managed with our van. Toilets and showers were very clean but no loo roll or loo seats!

23149,1292794,3,PaulaOR,03/07/2021,"Large pitches with plenty of trees for shade. It is true that it is a bit outdated and somewhat expensive for what it is, yes, in the center of the city. The location is unbeatable. Ponta da Piedade 10-15 min by bike. Price of one night for AC and two adults with electricity € 19."

The places would be nice, but the whole area is neglected. There is a lot of trash from the trees in the square. There are also old, rotten caravans standing around. The price is okay."
23149,1248656,2,JUANCANARIAS,11/06/2021,"Charity camping for the children's soccer team. Good service, good location and little noise, but neglected, trees should be pruned, leaves and weeds cleaned and removed and circulation areas fixed."

This camping is good. €13/night for a van, 2 people and a dog. 5 minutes walking to the city center, clean and warm showers, enough shadow on the parking spots.

We stayed 3 days and we would defenitely come back!"
23149,1120521,1,Urkrass,10/12/2020,"Right now it's no wonder a lot of people are avoiding the place. Just sad and bleak. The sanitary facilities are at the level of an Indian trucker rest stop. Wasn't cleaned in the 20 hours of our stay, the streaks in the toilet were always the same ... How can you run down a place with a good location?"
23149,1116229,1,UlrikeSolbach,19/11/2020,The location is excellent ... but that's about it. I don't use the toilet or shower ... I just park my van here ... very shabby. the reception staff was very friendly.

The toilets and bathrooms, between disgusting and abandoned. Anti-Covid 0 measures (there is no soap), garbage everywhere, and people living in a mix between tents and shacks."

It is right next to the town and next to the most beautiful beaches of Lagos, you can walk to Punta de Piedad (30 min) and there is good vibes. We do not use the common bathrooms so we cannot comment. Relationship location, comfort, price 5 points. I have to say that we were lucky to have a huge plot"

When I asked about the stadium parking lot, someone from the City Council answered me and I asked him about the Trindade campsite and he told me that it was already closed and that they were going to demolish it, but when we passed we saw that it is still open. But it looked so bad that we didn't stay there. The only good thing about it is the location"
23149,1006422,2,JuJuliana,27/08/2020,"Two stars just because it has some good spaces for motorhomes with shade and the location .. otherwise it looks like a trash can, scrap metal, cleaning or candle, zero finishes and lack of paper organization between reception and concierge."

The campsite offers a map with the center. There is a walk to do along the coast (100 m from the campsite). It is the heart of the chicken. hallucinating"
23149,754339,3,Tinglan,17/12/2019,"We stayed here 3 + 2 nights. As said before, quite a few people are living permanently here, which makes the camping a bit like a nomad camp. But we stayed both times at the lowest level, and so did 5-10 more ”normal” campers, and we found it OK. Our camper is 7,35 and no problem to park. The toilets and showers were both a disaster, so we didn’t use them. The area around them looked like city dump but we avoided that area. The campsite has someone in the reception 7-23 and that felt good. We had no problems and felt safe and took advantage of the positive thing: the short distance to the beautiful town. We also found the beautiful beach was very close: just walk across the parking/football ground adjacent to the camping, take the stairs up and pass the hotel(?) area and you will find it - don’t miss!"

Which surely explains the price. Far too many negative opinions that could prevent the stop. It is true that it is outdated, atypical by its attendance but frankly for one night, nothing to say. If you are used to luxury go your way."

The place itself is on the whole well maintained and the people are friendly and outgoing. The background noise is just as expected at a place in the center, it did not bother us.

The first day with two vans and the second completely alone. Some car at night but without major incident. I'm sure there's more trouble in town. Even the Civil Guard passed. No problem. There is a fountain with a good amount of water and complete silence at night.
23248,2419657,3,JPGomez,03/10/2022,"Quiet place but during the night a lot of movement of cars and that it is the end of the road, some doing the donkey with the car, and the music. (It was Saturday night)"

Bathrooms closed, I understand that due to covid. Hardly any water comes out of the fountain and even with an adapter I couldn't load water, the spout is oval."
23248,1130497,5,anaygua,14/01/2021,"It was our reference car park this Christmas, we moved around the area and every two days we slept there. About 3 km from the town but it is a very pleasant walk even at night. From there you can go to El Hornillo on foot, there is a good climb but the views make up for it. In the town you can stock up on everything and there are routes to do on foot or by bike. Everything is very clean, there are containers"
