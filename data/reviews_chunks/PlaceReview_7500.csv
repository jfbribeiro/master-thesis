101125,2449024,4,Canela91,17/10/2022,"Spectacular place, quiet, with the sound of the birds. To stop or spend the night."
101125,2435606,5,charini72,10/10/2022,Really beautiful. We stopped for lunch and the spectacular views. Very very quiet. We will repeat for sure.
101125,2384140,1,RVAR7007,18/09/2022,"The description of the location (quiet by the river...) really appealed to us. When we were there with our campervan, the road gave way to a dirt road covered with deep, vehicle-endangering potholes, which was restricted by fences on the right and left and finally gave way to a sandy dead-end road, it was impossible to think of continuing."
101125,1859173,5,Simjoe,29/04/2022,"Peace and quiet on a beautiful, almost untouched arm of the river, birds singing when you wake up. And after that: picking up rubbish from the predecessors. Completely incomprehensible why you have to leave your leftovers here. Somewhat difficult approach but possible in dry conditions without 4-wheel drive."
101125,1296221,3,basuneta,04/07/2021,Quiet place and the river helps to rest fresh but the terrain has a lot of unevenness. You have to choose shadow or flat. Many flies
101125,1259075,4,ManolazoTurbo,16/06/2021,"Quiet place, a bit of garbage but it was very good. acceptable road, no need for 4x4"
101125,1156309,5,AliGV,23/03/2021,"Beautiful place, very beautiful sunset through the eucalyptus trees. Ample space for several vans. Quiet. We woke up surrounded by sheep, great. Of course, a dirt road and narrow, but easy. We have found remains as if someone had made a bottle there, the only ugly aspect."
101125,415876,2,schroemand,25/12/2018,"Location ""quiet"" but not easy to access. You have to find the road that goes under the highway and then walk along several properties. Very quiet location at the edge of the water, but it looks like a 4x4 area. access is via a poor road. Nice night without being bothered"
101133,3274588,5,AE22,08/09/2023,"The best place on our visit to the island. Absolute tranquility at night, a joy. At the foot of the cove. During the day it is crazy."
101133,3245467,5,CorsarioCM,01/09/2023,"Good place, in the late afternoon there are no cars, only campers, quiet and with quite a few flat areas, the entrance is a little rocky but fine, there is a tree that provides shade with views of the sea, the next day it is very full of cars . At the entrance to the coves there are garbage containers."
101133,3222196,4,furgo_negreta,26/08/2023,Very calm. I recommend going late in the afternoon when the cars have already left and standing at the bottom. Inclined parking.
101133,3152321,5,Kikamper,15/08/2023,"Very quiet esplanade to spend the night, surrounded by vegetation and very close to the beach. In the morning it is full of bathers."
101133,3078233,5,Margarita_zaly,04/08/2023,Beautiful place. We spent an amazing night there with incredible views of the coves. Tip if you don't want to stay all day. It's better to leave early in the morning. Then a lot of cars come and it is impossible to leave. A family of stray cats lives nearby if you bring food for them. They will be very happy.
101133,2856861,5,AlexMAB,15/06/2023,"Good place to spend the night, without noise or cars at night, in the morning people park to go to the coves that are nearby. Perfect place"
101133,2838689,5,Gamarreta,10/06/2023,Super spot! Free parking between two beautiful coves. To spend the day and the night
101133,2828400,4,AlicheetJK,07/06/2023,"A very pleasant place with a sea view, there are places however where there are a lot of PQ !! Please throw your PQ in the trash if you still want to enjoy Van spots!! But the place is great"
101133,2774483,4,LostontheRoute,22/05/2023,"close to the beach. In high season gets full pretty quickly in the morning and it's easy to get locked in by other cars (especially with large vans/RV). We preferred parking a bit up the road, there are spots close to the road"
101133,2661383,4,Shibainu,11/04/2023,"Top place, compared to other bays for the time of year very little going on. Great for dog owners. View to Portas Vells if you stand in the back corner."
101133,2605810,4,steini1972,11/03/2023,"Parking lot with a great view! Access narrow, no garbage cans."
101133,2210768,2,Crystobal91,10/08/2022,"Parking spaces without more, near Mago bed (naturist). Good location but no services. Only Palamós to make a stop for a swim"
101133,1826676,3,Nicorow,16/04/2022,"Beautiful view, 2 min walk from a small beach with restaurant and departure for walks. Flat terrain. A car with young people stayed until late but without disturbing us. On the other hand, the immediate surroundings of the site served as toilets for a lot of people... Good for one night provided you stay in the motorhome (allows you to enjoy the view and the beach)"
101133,1817706,4,Tweiset,12/04/2022,"Good pitch for the night. Beautiful bay. But nothing more. Route not recommended with large campers. Honestly, if you're in Mallorca with a big camper, go back."
101133,1621130,4,jonastei,01/10/2021,"Great place to stay. First night we had some other campers together. Second night by ourselves and some cars would park there for few hours during the night so it didn’t feel so safe. Nice views, plenty of space to park and near to the beach Playa del Mago - naturist."
101133,1385465,5,gemmacallo,31/07/2021,Parking that is easy to reach even with large campers. sea View. a few meters below there are two beaches. in the evening it was just us and another camper. few cars in the morning. advised!
101133,1178332,4,anyeles77,23/04/2021,Quiet and beautiful .. esplanade with few views but next door is the capital ...
101133,437009,4,The.Wicksy.Wanderers,06/03/2019,Beautiful place. We parked further down the hill for the day.
101133,368137,2,kevaso,08/09/2018,I do not necessarily recommend ...
101141,3274141,1,POLICIA_LOCAL,08/09/2023,"We inform you that the regulations in Sant Josep do not allow camping or spending the night outside of the authorized campsites. The claim is up to 750 euros, please respect local regulations."
101141,2080429,1,Ana177,16/07/2022,Place very frequented in the evening by the local youth. Insecure.
101141,1213002,2,vansully,23/05/2021,The truth that the parking area as such does not provide much security for the area in which it is located. We were quite unlucky as there was a lot of movement of people and noise at night. The only thing we liked is that next to it there is a cliff with great views where you can watch the sunset.
101141,1133935,5,Dijarvo,30/01/2021,Perfect thank you :)
101141,1056066,1,victorcardona,18/09/2020,"The coordinates are not correct, it takes you down a stony path with no exit. The correct site is next door."
101141,911675,4,areusa,30/07/2020,"We arrived through the link of vicalu and perfect. All the way asphalt road. We arrived at night, there were already 2 ACs and a van parked. You could hear a car arriving and leaving I don't know if to fish, young people with a bottle, otherwise super silent. That if, not a shadow we spend a lot of heat."
101145,2572584,1,cebron,09/02/2023,Not suitable for CC
101145,2519811,1,davidlasnavas,11/12/2022,"Parking for cars or small vans, poor access, places not valid for motorhomes, many trees with low branches that scratch the motorhome"
101145,2503719,1,adriaontour,23/11/2022,"Normal free car park. Narrow and steep. At least parked up during the week, no chance of space. Maximum for Bullis and small vans. Also driveway steep. Not recommendable."
101145,2428877,1,chaplinpedroyyo,07/10/2022,"Parking very steep, with small and narrow spaces. By height it is not good either because you drag the branches of the trees when maneuvering. we don't stay"
101145,2270452,2,zulezule,19/08/2022,It did not give us security. There was an atmosphere of young people and others. Very lopsided. We went somewhere else to sleep.
101145,2135150,4,LliureTxango,28/07/2022,"Close to the old town and next to the swimming pool. We spent one night and slept very peacefully, the cleaners go by early in the morning and the movement of people coming to the bar at night, but it calms down by 12.00. Plenty of shade and pool toilets available. A place to return to!!"
101145,2099446,5,Emilio88,20/07/2022,"We did not sleep here, we went to the Guadiloba reservoir (highly recommended) to sleep near but outside of Caceres. Here we parked to see Cáceres about 12 minutes walk from the center and to take a bath and a shower in the pool (great idea). Tree shaded area in general."
101145,1899340,3,alessandromaria6180,18/05/2022,"Good for small jigs far from the old town about 15 min on foot at the top left out of the parking lot at the place statue on horseback left again then after a small garden again to the left. On the other hand, the old town listed by UNESCO is breathtaking and not to be missed. Difficult to spend the night noisy small and sloping places"
101145,1812960,2,Patruski,10/04/2022,"By day to visit the center is great. but at night don't even try it, at least on the weekend, they have a bottle and there is a lot of noise. We had to go to a more secluded residential area."
101145,1703790,4,misskuki,05/12/2021,"Good parking lot for exploring the old town on foot. Now in December it is pretty empty and despite the trees there is room to maneuver. Our car is only 6m long but 3m high. We didn't stay the night here, no idea whether that would be possible. Despite the central location, it is very quiet!"
101145,1703400,2,Prosk,05/12/2021,This was on a Saturday. There were people making a bouillon and the atmosphere was not good enough to spend the night. it did not give security.
101145,1697205,3,yoyasa,24/11/2021,"Normal parking, it does not have an AC parking area, it is very busy but at night it is very quiet and you are 10 minutes walk from the historic center. No service."
101145,1592044,3,Piquituerto,19/09/2021,Parking full of tree branches without pruning and with badly parked cars. You can get into a mousetrap.
101145,1579263,4,lagusa,15/09/2021,"Near a beautiful park with an area of fountain dogs and a great variety of birds, it closes at night but you can enter on foot, the National Police passed by, we told them we went because the AC area was full and without problem we spent a very quiet night at the shade of trees, near the historic center (walking 15min) and the municipal swimming pool (2 € fee)."
101145,1568822,3,MireiaLucia,11/09/2021,Parking very close to the center quite narrow and without services. On weekends a bit noisy at night.
101145,1532475,4,elipink,30/08/2021,"We slept here on a Friday night because of the comments that there is a lot of noise in the trailer park. We had no problem, very quiet place with trees. The car parks are small, if you have a very large motorhome you may not enter the car parks. It also has an arch to enter but it is quite high. It is 10 minutes from the Plaza Mayor on foot"
101145,1448756,4,Franvito,13/08/2021,"We stayed one night, a fairly quiet place and near the center (about 10 min walk) there is usually enough space. It does not have any type of services, it is only car parking"
101145,1421459,3,valles2013,08/08/2021,"Wooded area, super quiet. We spent Saturday night with no problem."
101145,1390367,2,IsabelRomeroLopez,01/08/2021,It is sloping and no toilets or bakery. It is a parking lot for cars. The municipal swimming pool is right next door.
101145,1385767,3,Ruilobos,31/07/2021,We park only during the day to get to know the city. At 10 minutes from the center. Recommendable.
101145,1359204,3,timourrou,24/07/2021,Shaded car park 10 minutes walk from the city center. Ideal for a visit to the historic center during the day
101145,1182018,4,lkwlkwlkw,30/04/2021,Fab spot very close to the city centre. Gets very crowded during the week. We slept there on Sunday night almost alone and Monday morning we were surrounded! We also had to take up 2 spots in our 6m van because it’s quite tight. However it’s super close to the beautiful old town of Caceres and (despite them being closed at the moment) there are toilets and a cafe nearby. Plus a stunning park just next door. It was a great stop for 1 night and no one fussed about us being there.
101145,983942,4,martaaraque,20/08/2020,"Very good. We came very hot and we went to the municipal swimming pool that is next to the parking lot, very friendly and well priced. They are open from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Then we went to the center of Caceres at 15 minutes walking. I recommend it"
101145,943179,4,naitxu87,09/08/2020,"Very quiet and with many trees, it is very good to spend the night."
101145,929153,4,IanBritten,04/08/2020,Very close to the center and very quiet. It is full of trees.
101145,875823,3,timward2000,17/07/2020,"Excellent place in a beautiful park and right next to the pool. However, a local police man has just stopped to tell me that camping is not allowed here"
101145,867592,5,namaste_mundura,14/07/2020,"A 10 place to spend the night. Shade, tranquility, municipal swimming pools (€ 2 adult, € 1.5 child) and one kilometer from the Plaza Mayor."
101145,787410,3,Amorvaz,27/02/2020,Very quiet parking at night and relatively close to downtown walking. Large areas in case you carry a dog. For the full day.
101145,695610,2,atxuriondo,18/09/2019,"The area seems very nice, but avoid Friday and Saturday nights. Young people get together to drink with very loud music in cars. We had to go at 1:30 in the morning to another place."
101145,688137,4,foodycamper,12/09/2019,"Very comfortable to visit the city, easy access and easy parking. We went on Saturday and there was some hustle and bustle with young people making bottles but highly recommended."
101145,656631,3,Tanruz,24/08/2019,Quiet and shady parking near the busy city center.
101145,648837,5,racribeiro,21/08/2019,"A great place to park. Very near to the center, wide spaces, near to the municipal swimming pool (2€ per adult)"
101145,632454,5,Fatim,16/08/2019,"We spent a quiet night. A walk from the historic center. There was only one more Camper. We were park and pool, recommended."
101145,624054,4,Tatitxu,13/08/2019,"We have spent a quiet and cool night here. The park and the pool with its restaurant are next door. In the morning, the cafeteria (with its toilet) was closed almost at ten, on a Tuesday, so we had to walk 5-10 'to find an open cafeteria, and we reached a pedestrian street with the cafeteria El gran café, recommendable . Good breakfasts and cheap."
101145,479528,4,Frangel,08/05/2019,"It is a free parking, the best place to visit the historic center, quiet, with shade, only for camper vans for the length of the squares."
101145,445792,5,carlosblay,28/03/2019,"I live in Cáceres and, as an alternative to the municipal motorhome area, I would recommend this place. It is quiet, safe, very large, relatively cool in summer, and a step away from the city center."
101145,390266,4,USCFoot3,09/10/2018,"Location not too noisy despite the avenue above. No toilet and water due to the closure of the pool. Indicate instead ""5 quail José Luis Catallo"" to the GPS. Parking for Van and camper short, otherwise obligation to park across several places. Free and shaded parking to serve the park next door. Playground outside the car park between the buildings."
101145,373874,3,Piolin,15/09/2018,"Staggered parking, with a few trees. We have spent a very quiet night. There is no service. The Prince's Park is very good for a walk, it is quite large and very well maintained. We spent the night of September 15 and there was a lot of free space, there was no other Camper or motorhome, but there were parked cars. I suppose in summer it will be more difficult."
101151,3186383,3,VictorAlija,20/08/2023,"From the photos I expected something more striking. The very clayey soil, added to the summer heat is a constant dusting. During the day very hot, at night too cold. In general, there were almost no people. I think it is an ideal destination for spring or autumn. In summer it is better to let it go."
101151,2820529,4,doelaida,04/06/2023,"Very quiet place I was for 3 days (weekend) few people, trees for shade, town nearby to buy and camping nearby as well. The bad, many bugs, and people making illegal bonfires."
101151,2750090,5,Anasfamily,14/05/2023,Just a pity the very loud music that spoils this place of calm and freedom
101151,2600115,5,Wunderkinder,05/03/2023,"A very beautiful and super quiet place. We stood here easily and very happily. The lake is beautiful, I'm sure even more beautiful when it's full. Sunset and sunrise is beautiful. An absolute highlight is the Cornyn, the hike is 14km and we had to do it with the kids. We hardly ever slept. Shop beforehand or you'll have to drive a long time."
101151,2564549,5,pandorahora,30/01/2023,amazing spot. super chill and quiet. no services. but a close enough water point (marked on park4night). there's a nice mountain bike loop that can be done around the lake.
101151,2552178,5,bergmoewen,15/01/2023,"This place turned out to be a true oasis of well-being for us! Absolute peace and beautiful view. police controlled. We didn't stand by the water, we stayed upstairs. No problem."
101151,2194076,4,aap033,07/08/2022,Spectacular tranquility and views of the swamp. There are no services but it is very clean. It's up to us to keep it that way.
101151,1887635,4,rvanvugt,13/05/2022,"It's prohibited to stay directly at the waterfront, at least during the night. The area directly at the street is very convenient, almost flat and has shades from the high tree. Quiet during day and night, though one does hear every single car passing by and every now and then a barking dog from the campsite. Clean and cosy with nice walks around and alongside the lake."
101151,1798985,4,Rockenaufsocken,28/03/2022,"Quiet nights spent with no problems. The water level is very low at the moment, so you don't stand directly on the shore."
101151,1759428,5,LeBary,18/02/2022,"Good place to sleep. A place is lower towards the lake but is not straight. FYI, the lake is very low at the moment like all the others in the region, due to the drought."
101151,1726356,5,Van_Benson,05/01/2022,Very nice and quiet place to stand. Please just stand above and respect nature.
101151,1240785,5,thetonioproject,06/06/2021,Nice spot but do not go exactly to this spot but 500 meters further on the beach :) do not go if it is raining the land can turn to mud
101151,1185183,5,TheDude67,04/05/2021,Fantastic safe parking with loads of shade.
101151,1117741,5,chiensanslaisse,26/11/2020,Very good spot I spent 3 nights there without any worries in a calm environment by the lake thank you
101151,777299,1,pipwat,07/02/2020,"Moved on by civil guards Friday 7th February 2020. There were many spots and it was very quiet, so it was a surprise. There’s a paying campsite on the same road 300 metres away, therefore they are probably more strict because of this."
101151,774137,5,Lesnik,30/01/2020,"Great place for game parking. We drove deeper. It's best to stay on the visible path and position the car. Besides where is flat, the bottom is also soft."
101151,770167,5,WhattheHeck.Travels,19/01/2020,"Awesome spot! We arrived in the dark so just parked up above the eventually spot.  Google sends you to this spot where you can stand. But you can also drive a little lower to the lake, which gives you a stunning place to stay! There is space for several vans, no services."
101151,751964,1,CasitaNL,09/12/2019,Prohibition to stay overnight
101151,747662,5,thomas4203,27/11/2019,Quiet place overlooking the lake. We stayed the night at 3 trucks without worries. Several focus for fire already in place
101151,710868,5,upupa_van,02/10/2019,Very nice place and very quiet!
101151,673763,5,Clarence24,02/09/2019,Fabulous spot! Clean quiet and fantastic peaceful views across the lake. Also a great little cheap n cheerful bar 5 mins walk up the road.
101151,422525,5,LaLata,14/01/2019,"A beautiful place, we stayed inside the circle of trees, overlooking the marsh. A very quiet night With a van you can park closer to the lake. I do not recommend it on rainy days, there were wheel marks sunk in the ground."
101168,2329989,5,campervc,01/09/2022,We have been many times and great. No noise and very close to the bathing area. The bad thing is that they have taken away our drinking water source.
101168,1532016,5,panadero16,30/08/2021,We stayed the night from Friday to Saturday and very quiet spent the night
101168,1211738,4,Fadcd,22/05/2021,"Next to the climbing routes, and with a very practical fountain!"
101168,823887,2,Elsacoal,14/06/2020,"Climbers meet with music and party until the early hours of the morning, nothing quiet."
101168,680450,1,Sparrow73,07/09/2019,"Very loud, people making bottles with loud music until many times. Nothing recommended"
101168,623088,1,pesta,12/08/2019,"Much traffic of people, noise of people with the music playing in the cars."
101168,599264,1,eleal,04/08/2019,"Big bottle, night cars and lots of mosquitoes"
101168,521199,4,Albertgalka,19/06/2019,Great spot to pass the night. There is fresh water pomp. Very near to a climbing zone.
101175,1864952,3,JavierCebrian,02/05/2022,"They have put up a sign, it only authorizes parking for cars. We asked a policeman and he told us that they would fine us, it depends on the technical file. He told us that we could park without any problem in the parallel street that is just below the car park."
101175,1721099,1,Antrope,31/12/2021,"We tried to spend the night but the access was sealed by the local police, we don't know if it was because they were painting the areas for the market on the esplanade (every Thursday), some workers told us the next day or they left it cut off forever. We parked in a nearby street and spent the night quietly but in this place it was not possible."
101175,1494114,1,toniluma,21/08/2021,When we went there was not a single motorhome. We do not stay. Various cars. If there were several people with cars and chairs in the parking lot
101175,758345,3,Chrisleda,28/12/2019,"Very good parking for a large vehicle with trailer, we spent one night, a little noise but appreciable anyway. Thank you for sharing"
101175,433111,1,arianeuh,24/02/2019,"I do not see how this parking is secure. No barriers, no cameras. Just a huge, dismal parking lot with trucks and a few vans."
101175,425223,5,Donjavier,28/01/2019,Excellent place. We spent 3 nights prior to leaving the AC at the airport. We black them in the public bathroom and leave everything very clean. The gray at a gas station 600 meters. We went to the center door of the sun by metro that is 200 meters. Very good place Very sure.
101175,418025,4,virginiaher,30/12/2018,Perfect

We were received very pleasantly and the lady of the house speaks a little English. Bar and restaurant were closed but very well maintained sanitary facilities were open. Beautiful antique villages such as Valverde and Villanueva de la Vera are worth visiting.
101217,2410254,4,Tommy_Wrangler,28/09/2022,"Very pleasant campsite. The equipment is a bit old, but clean and tidy. The reception staff is super friendly and so is the night watchman.

101217,1137862,5,NewBartolita,15/02/2021,"We have spent 3 days of luxury, an area for AC with soil and cleaning of the branches of the trees that scare us so much, clean bathrooms, clean sinks and complied with Covid standards, personal and good attention and being a campsite on this date we were 2 camper and an AC, we have room and if they treat us well, then more visits will have. Near the throat, near routes, about 600 from the center of town, although several things closed, but it was worth € 23 car, 2 people and electricity.

101217,681645,3,sergi_ac,08/09/2019,"Few services for the price they have. It has many shadows, almost the entire campsite is covered with trees and this makes it very cool even with heat. Beware of high motorhomes because the trees are not very tall and you have to drive inside very carefully not to hit."
101225,1660048,5,SaraPorto,24/10/2021,"Very quiet place to sleep, at night almost no cars pass. If any noise bothers you to sleep, this is not your place, the turbines make some noise but very relaxing to our ears."

101345,2109897,2,kikepul,23/07/2022,"Uncomfortable place to sleep, the neighbors are not very keen on the work and call the Civil Guard, I left there with a €200 fine for being poorly parked (the overhang entered the lawn a little) and for being less than 200 meters from the coast. I certainly don't recommend it at all. Just as they fined me, they fined the other 4 cars and vans that were there. Very profitable on the weekend"
101345,1817547,1,SmartGirl,12/04/2022,"Very crowded place, at night the kids of the town go to drink and have a party. I spent one night here and my solar panel was stolen. I do not recommend this area for vandalism."

Noisy at night, by the kids."
101345,1011527,4,caravaning2000,29/08/2020,We have spent the night here several motorhomes and campers and they have not told us anything. At the beginning of the night there were some cohavales outside talking but around 12:30 pm to 1:00 pm they left. Very quiet area. We don't get anything out of the AC. You can pecn but not camp. The space is limited because it is really a car park but you can park your ass and put it that protrudes through the lawn area and thus not disturb or occupy several places.
101345,561903,1,PayMi,19/07/2019,"This super full of bathers cars. The neighbors protest and call the police, who invites us to leave. Very nasty"

101368,2883543,4,hydrophil,23/06/2023,"Very beautiful and secluded. But as I just said, quite a tedious and washed-out dirt road! (see new photo).. Plus little space and very uneven! About 4 reasonably straight places at the moment"
101368,2879146,5,enbuscadelsol,21/06/2023,"Very complicated access after the rains this winter, but the place is worth it, 100% disconnection. Part of the beach is nudist. The floor is somewhat uneven, we had no problem in low season. Hiking trail nearby."
101368,2124568,3,MarisolEdrosa,26/07/2022,"Great views of the sunset, somewhat complicated access if your vehicle is low but it can be reached.

101368,1698184,4,mikal83,26/11/2021,We parked here for 2 nights in mid september. Theres a steepish mud drive down to hit via a narrow lane BUT our Relay campervan made it easy. Only 1 or 2 flattish spots amongst parking for 10 vans all told. Popular with local surfers but very quite at night. Located at the eastern end of the beach which is nudist!
101368,1637960,1,L.Sim,10/10/2021,Nature reserve. The path behind the concrete block is also very sandy. we got stuck with the inner van and could only be freed by very nice Spaniards. Better on the parking lots nearby ...
101368,1540244,2,letarmo74,02/09/2021,Watch out for young Spaniards who threaten to report to the police when nobody is disturbed. Very bad mentality in 2021 ... This was not the case at the beginning of 2000 ... Too bad for tourism.
101368,974324,5,Aliocha38,17/08/2020,"A magnificent place, a few surfers' van, respectful and calm. The only inconvenience: the dogs which make poop everywhere, the dunes are literally riddled with it. The dogs from the trucks next door piss on our van, run over the meal while we eat ... I understand that we want to travel with our dog, but frankly for the others next door, it is not pleasant"
101407,2846761,4,IngeLarsenOnTour,12/06/2023,We parked here during the day when we visit Madrid. Easy with the metro. Afterward ww spend the night here. The gas station is 24 my open. Fine place. Toilets at the gas station

101443,3243918,1,mierdacia,31/08/2023,"Not recommended, it is next to a youth party area. A lot of noise, better to go to the engineering school which is next door and the area is quieter."

101468,2313629,2,Summerinthecity,28/08/2022,"The campsite is very nice, well-kept and clean, but also the most expensive of our previous trip to Spain. Motorhome, 2 adults with dog for €78.92. It is annoying or outrageous that, despite full mobile reception (4G Vodafone, LTE Telekom), mobile Internet is apparently blocked in order to force the purchase of WiFi."

101468,1916505,3,dafnos,26/05/2022,"facilities first class, close to the beach, nice shaded, spacious pitches.  BUT although dogs allowed, they are not allowed anywhere in the bar/restaurant area. Wind was relentless, didn’t even get the chairs out, camp rules state not to leave pets unsupervised, so we ended up sitting in the van as there is nowhere else to go! Next Campsite 200 yds further down allows dogs in the bar area."

There is even a helpful camping shop nearby. We would love to come back here."
101468,1659672,5,JPAARemyGigi21,24/10/2021,Excellent purpose built camping ground with first class facilities well maintained and kept clean throughout the day and night. Mostly flat pitches with view or shaded by trees. It is so good that it kind of spoils you for other sites. A minor drawback is that the site is a little isolated. The stated distances to the beach and local village are less than what they actually are. Important if hot!
101468,1656497,5,tobster1596,22/10/2021,"Fair prices, nice staff, close to the beach. There are rolls in the supermarket at the campsite."

You can hear the waves breaking at night. Only spent the night there."

But I think it is a good place, there is enough space and you are better here to the lagoons than at the upper car park which offers very little space where you would have to come really late evening or early but not to take the space away from the hikers . There are always bays for parking along the entire route of the main road. Such a beautiful hike."

101837,2397728,1,ReinhardKrix,23/09/2022,The sanitary facilities are absolutely disgusting. The fact that the place is super cheap and the employees are nice does not improve the assessment.

101849,1658353,5,Amarelo,23/10/2021,"Spot easily accessible, several proposals for parking the vehicle (choice of sunrise or sunset). The higher you go, the more wind there is. Nice view over the valley. Slightly cracked, we took some wipes and waste lying around."
101849,775351,3,bricolo40,02/02/2020,"Phew ... we're there ... a bit of a pain to show and we're in Jumper. But what a view and what a calm. Supper place, we stay for a picnic and a little walk. To do."

101861,2682883,4,Birdycamper,20/04/2023,"Very quiet night overall, the toilets clean, on the other hand behind the mill there is a lot of rubbish on the ground. I don't understand why when there are trash cans everywhere. What is certain are not motorhomes, we respect the environment and nature."
101861,2653566,5,hongx,09/04/2023,"We spent a very quiet night here, close to the center and a supermarket downstairs. Public bath open 24 hours. The only problem is that it is a parking lot and there is no shade, it can get hot in summer."
101861,2609309,5,janvan75,14/03/2023,"nice place, nice view, nice toilet block, there is also a block with four water taps, unknown whether this is drinking water.. had a quiet night here. the mill is beautiful. don't forget to tip the miller"
101861,2606474,4,ScottCSchank,12/03/2023,"Doing the N2 from Faro to Chaves. Stopped here on the first night. Enormous lot with only a half dozen motorhomes. Very, very clean. It was Saturday night, so the biker club played some music, but it was NOT very loud (and we were right next to the building). No services, but we knew that. Perfectly suitable place to spend the night. Intermarché 200m away."
101861,2557515,3,bkb,22/01/2023,"Large cobblestone and sand car park on the fairground, next to the mill. No services (emptying and non-potable water at Intermarché just below). No traffic at night, but the bikers from the nearby club had the engines roaring like crazy until late at night). Nice little town to visit."
101861,2556590,5,mjtaylor66,21/01/2023,"Great stop over to visit the town of Catso Verde. This is flat gound if you parl towards the back mear the windmill

There is a public toilet and wash basin in the car park, and if you look over the bank an intermarche with black waste and grey waste - the water there is NON POTABLE so not for drinking 
Thank you to the council for this opportunity,"

101861,2504346,5,Thierrycarron,24/11/2022,"We spent 2 days here it was perfect and pleasant. The 2 nights without noise. The small town is quiet and pleasant, the people are very friendly. Parked near the mill it is flat and calmer. I recommend this area."
101861,2497299,5,furgotina,16/11/2022,"We spent a very quiet night. In the morning we realized that at the end, on the slope facing the intermarche, which is below, there are some electricity outlet boxes, we didn't test them, but they are there."
101861,2489368,5,loopylinda,10/11/2022,"Great place to stopover. lovely bars and restaurants withing very short walking distance, also Intermarche supermarket. Toilets too. Close to the road but didn't hear any traffic during the night."
101861,2403825,5,JohnSteele,26/09/2022,Brilliant place to park up. We parked by the windmill so we had the view of the town one side and overlooked the intermarche the other side. There were vans parked in the intermarche that looked fine but up here we had the views.  10 mins walk into town. 2 mins walk down some steps for the supermarket. Toilets here which we didn't use. Had a good quiet nights sleep. Would recommend
101861,2311328,5,margarita13,27/08/2022,"We tried to go to the inter, but the machines really make a lot of noise. We came to the fairground next to the windmill. We spent the night with no problem, super quiet. Just be careful if there will be no market the next day"
101861,2159510,5,fmir,02/08/2022,"For a night. Optimal. The space at the end of the parking lot, near the mill, is preferred."
101861,1857262,5,Rgbrown3,28/04/2022,"Peaceful night next to the windmill, which was operating. The windmill keeper looked at us a bit funny when we arrived but told us we were welcome to stay when I spoke to him - well worth staying just to see the mill in action! We used the services at the intermarche, but this is the place to stop over without question. Take other's advice and drive to the quiet end of the big carpark."
101861,1821669,4,jolouv,14/04/2022,"Beautiful, large parking lot on the edge of the town. Free and close to an intermarche. Free water and clean toilets. If you drive to the end you have a nice view over the area."

101861,1774727,4,currini,05/03/2022,"The place is very good, it is true that you have to get away from the trucks that leave around 6 in the morning and make noise."
101861,1770744,4,yoyobam,02/03/2022,"The place is magnificent and near the center it is necessary to privilege the upper part next to the mill, it is flatter. We were unlucky we arrived on Mardi Gras evening and a techno party was organized in what must be a youth center to the left of the mill we had to leave the place at two o'clock in the morning to find a quieter place to sleep."
101861,1764132,5,redadoree,23/02/2022,Did our washing and shopping at Intermarche then found this 600m away. With 7 others in February. Several places to eat and drink nearby. Didn't disturb us. We did a walk of places of interest round the town. You can go in the windmill nearby. No services except bins and toilets. Very quiet although trucks nearby leave around 6am so park away from them if light sleeper. Thank you town.

101861,1691582,4,te.tummers,17/11/2021,"Nice place to spend the night, also a pleasant village to visit. The location is a market area with a public toilet, but there are still campers who have to empty the chemical toilet in the public toilet, especially if it is 50 mtr. there is also a service place at the intermarché, shameful!!"
101861,1680467,4,NathalieDefour,06/11/2021,Really nice place in the center of a pleasant village. Water at the bottom of the parking lot behind the mill.

seems like the water at service point is not portable? there are taps in the car park but no information as to portable or not."
101861,1644627,1,mikanaud,14/10/2021,There are free services at intermarché the village is very pretty. I put a star because I do not advise anyone to come. I felt stared like who's this stranger we're looking at you we're not saying hello. it's my 2nd day in portugal hello welcome ....
101861,1632254,5,CarlosArsenio,08/10/2021,Normal car park that serves as a place for holding municipal fairs. Very quiet at night. Some movement during the day but everything is normal. Pay attention to the calendar of municipal fairs. It may be closed for the fairs.

101861,937722,5,DavidLF,07/08/2020,Well worth getting here early not for parking as their is loads available but to enjoy the cafes and walk the small streets. My kind of Portugal Town worth retiring in. Also at the Infermache down the road is free grey and black water emptying and fresh water refill even with outside washing machines all next to a great supermarket
101861,844584,5,hymer4family,02/07/2020,"Simple location, close to the center and with supermarket very close.  I recommend."

101861,794011,5,geoffthefridge,11/03/2020,What a beautiful spot. Very peaceful overnight just the occasional dog barking in the distance. There is a clock with bells but didn’t hear it at night. Overlooking the countryside with Intermarche just below us with free Aire plus laundry.
101861,791666,5,TranceFormation,06/03/2020,"Superb location, beautiful view of the valleys dotted with Liège oak. Water and draining during intermarking. Nice little restaurant O Bombeiro at the entrance to the city."
101861,783872,4,jacknight,21/02/2020,"Indeed large area. Even though I haven't seen a cc logo, I think day / night stop is allowed. Note: the main entrance is the ""exit""! So bypass the parking lot to see the entrance. Prefer the top of the space behind the windmill: magnificent view of the village (especially at night) and the surroundings. You go down a few steps and you are at the Intermarché! And good little restaurant opposite the ""exit"" on the other side of the street. Guaranteed tranquility but indeed no shade."
101861,781360,3,orenoque,16/02/2020,Drain gray and black water and free water (report non-potable) at the Intermarché next to the self-service laundromat. Opposite the parking lot.

However, in my opinion, this does not justify the high price of almost 200 euros for three nights (2 people and mobile home). The pool could also be a good bit bigger."
101867,3011362,5,Vlaamsecamper,24/07/2023,"beautiful, neat campsite with many Dutch-speaking people on the campsite. very neat sanitary facilities this is really worth 5 stars, cleaned several times a day, reception very helpful. and nicely located. half an hour's walk to the start of the city, 10 minutes' walk to the promenade and the beach where there are also food and beverage outlets, a winner"
101867,2986060,4,WolliMeyer,19/07/2023,"The place was clean and the sanitary facilities were great and included in the price. We paid 85 euros for 2 adults and 3 children in the high season. But only good for us as a stopover, because we didn't like the area at all. Typical hotel buildings from the 80/90s and vacant buildings. ""Hundeklo"" directly behind the square.

101879,3008626,5,LaureS31,23/07/2023,We found this car park next to a pleasant beach and would have liked to spend the night there but we had already booked a campsite because of comments about the height... There is indeed a barrier at 2.20m on the car park closest to the beach but it is possible to access spaces a little further. Parking is free from 7 p.m. to 9 a.m. I believe

101879,2453122,5,ifarre,20/10/2022,"In front of Saturraran beach. The barrier was open when we went. I suspect that you will not be able to park AC in the summer. But in October we had no problem, we were about 3 AC and 3 campers. Good for visiting the town, a walk takes you along the sea side to there in about 10'. We were very good."
101879,2419328,5,unibabe,02/10/2022,"A lot more than 8 pitches available near this gorgeous beach. No height barrier and no charge at present so there were about a dozen campers with us. No facilities available. There were a couple of cars that came in late revving engines etc, but soon left. It’s a short walk along the coast path into Ondarroa, which is worth a promenade to see its bridges, church & old street. A lively place when we visited."
101879,2394994,2,sebule,22/09/2022,"So, according to the signs, the places at the entrance are also subject to a fee (10€/24h to be paid with a totally bad, dubious app ""arinpark""). Spaces are very narrow and at the entrance of the car park (ALL people walk and drive past the space - not particularly quiet). But the stand is close and beautiful. The police checked the other places this afternoon and probably distributed tickets."

Who can think of putting an area there? As a place it is good but there is plenty of bar or places. They could put it inside the car park."

102000,2062662,3,VANCanarios,11/07/2022,"Parking very quiet to sleep but without services. Incredible views. We recommend that you follow the signs to Playa de los Nogales, do not use Google Maps because it takes you down some complicated path!"
102000,1397025,2,Master29,03/08/2021,"A very quiet parking to spend the night without services, if it is clear you can see a spectacular sunrise"
102000,1161677,5,AntonioSimba,31/03/2021,Wonderful night watching the moon rise and in the morning at del Sol. Los Nogales beach is beautiful!
102000,1139869,5,CampervanTim,20/02/2021,A great spot next to a big and nice beach. Good for surfing. Very quiet. The walk down to the beach is long with a lot of steps but very charming
102000,1117314,1,VianofamilyUster,23/11/2020,"Dreadful! How the waves thunder against the island and the sun wakes up in the morning, disgusting! More about this on insta at Heliklopter8610"
102000,756465,5,zbynekvavros,24/12/2019,Parking lot with water tap. 10 minutes walk from quite hidden beach with outdoor showers. Park near the the small wall to avoid falling rocks!
102000,736794,5,bluevibes,02/11/2019,"Beautiful spot! very quiet, only the tourists passing by in the morning. You have to walk down the stairs to access the beach."
102000,414713,5,kubakrukar,17/12/2018,"Beautiful spot. For access, I recommend taking the LP-1 till Puntallana and taking the LP-102 from there (there are signs to the beach later on). This is the least steep and the widest road (totally fine for our Ducato). There is a water tap available directly on the car park - in the corner, next to the garbage bin (left to the stairs). There are also showers on the beach. Keep in mind the beach is a good 5-10min walk down the stairs. I would avoid parking directly under the rock wall - there were rocks that have just fallen from it. We were alone at night but the place is popular during the day."
102019,2713366,2,11071958,01/05/2023,Free water at pump number 8 with the corkscrew hose
102019,432371,4,Didiruca06,23/02/2019,"Perfect to fill the water tank, does not come out with much pressure so to fill large tanks with patience, large and very complete gas station even with fruit stop outside."
102024,2361019,3,mome7,11/09/2022,Good place to visit the center and also to catch the boat the next morning. He sleeps well with some car traffic without more. It has no services. Local police about 100M.
102024,1821194,3,IvanGP,14/04/2022,Dirt parking close to the center. You can visit the city on foot from here. It is a noisy place due to traffic. There are no services.
102024,1705931,1,jasebri,08/12/2021,There is a bottle area very close. I have not slept.
102024,1584813,5,alimagp,17/09/2021,Central location and close to everything. Good for catching the boat or if you just got off at night. The police are 2 blocks away and that also gives you security
102026,2004586,5,NicoMontenegro,23/06/2022,"There is water, it costs €1 and you can empty the water, thanks."
102026,652229,4,laetiroad,22/08/2019,Good reception we can clean the water ect super
102040,1230179,4,AlbaGRF,01/06/2021,"Area with tables, shade and water fountain, perfect to stop to eat and stretch your legs. It also has a park for girls and boys! The only but ... it does not have bathrooms when the beach bar / restaurant is closed."
102040,862231,1,Yuanyu,12/07/2020,"Don't even think about going to the bar. Expensive, bad, and off-the-shelf products. In the park there are tables, good shade and very quiet, you can park perfectly."
102074,2841367,3,labeaga,11/06/2023,We spent the night there. Very quiet The train is nearby but they don't pass at night
