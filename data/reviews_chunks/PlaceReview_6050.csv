77283,2810355,5,Worth,01/06/2023,"We really liked the campsite, the reception was very friendly and even in different languages. In the complex there are also numerous bungalows in partially car-free zones, which are really beautifully laid out with well-kept lawns and exotic trees. The sanitary area is cleaned well until the evening. The price with the Acsi Card was great in the off-season."
77283,2803232,5,Sylvainravaud,30/05/2023,"if I could put 6 stars ... top reception, speaks French and for 100th for three nights for 3 and a van. swimming pool with slides for children."
77283,2780167,5,carnavalfamily,23/05/2023,"Clean sanitary facilities with PQ, ideal swimming pool for children (closes early), hot showers, wifi and electricity included. We spent 3 nights for around 90€ (2 adults and 2 children in a van)"
77283,2737330,5,garnessandrine,09/05/2023,"very nice service, large swimming pool and 2 paddling pools with games and slides. beach just in front and for sports enthusiasts the possibility of cycling on one side or the other off the road. we were there at the beginning of May and we are 55 years old, at a low price of 22 € per night."
77283,2712493,4,happyholiday2022,01/05/2023,"Very nice facility, many rules. Nice for kids, great pool area. Sanitary clean, is cleaned a lot. We paid an exaggerated price due to the long weekend. 46€ per night, it's not worth it! Beach directly about 300m, beautiful beach"
77283,2698107,4,ResiundOli,26/04/2023,"Great place. Everything very clean. There is a lot for children: playground, children's toilets, children's pool and baby bath. Otherwise there are many rules. Opening hours of the swimming pool are completely stupid. Till 17 o clock."
77283,2668284,4,gaizkabar,13/04/2023,"Nice campsite. Neat and well-kept facilities. Beautiful piste area, 2 minutes from the beach and 15 minutes from the village. In Holy Week two adults, one small child and AC 30€. The train passes by quite often, but at least for us the noise was not a problem. Lots of dust in the plots and little shade. When coming to Ackin pass through the tunnel of the train station otherwise it is impossible to get there"
77283,2664684,5,HarryKlein,12/04/2023,"Very clean and quiet, the railway line may be a bit annoying With ADAC or Acsi card 20.50 EU all inclusive - 2 people Very attractive pool area and inviting beach Gray water disposal and fresh water available in the parking lot, toilets in the sanitary facilities, laundry and restoration and shopping on the site and (Lidl) 2km away Very friendly and uncomplicated service"
77283,2399575,5,Mr.Ti,24/09/2022,"We can not understand the partly negative reviews. Value for money is great here. Great campsite. Calm. Very clean. Sanitary facilities are regularly cleaned several times a day. Swimming pool was great. Tennis, football, fitness field, indoor play hall available. Sea five minutes away, with showers and toilets. Great with kids. We heard little or nothing from the train."
77283,2385466,4,JRM64,19/09/2022,"The camoung is very well located. Close to the beach, restaurants... Etc. They gave us a small plot for a 7.5 meter AC. We had to go to reception to complain and the next day they changed our pitch. Good attention but they give priority to the caravan or bungalow public, what to those of us who go in a motorhome. The campsite restaurant is also no gem."
77283,2355877,4,foye,09/09/2022,Beautiful campsite 50m from the beach and a good 1/2 hour from the town center on foot. A beautiful swimming pool and all services on site. Only downside: the frequent passage of the train.
77283,2241617,4,danivr7,15/08/2022,"Very good campsite. All services. Plots of various sizes, I was in the master and I had half a plot left over. Cross the street and there is the beach, very clean and without crowds. Calafell is a 10-minute walk along the promenade. very careful, has security and surveillance. The supermarket has almost everything."
77283,2064827,1,K-SNIGHT,12/07/2022,I find that the prices are excessive for a CC 2 adults 2 children 80 € per night the principle of camping because it is to pay less for the stay in addition it no longer takes the asci card I strongly advise against
77283,2034613,4,Mullaghroe,03/07/2022,"Just arrived after 3 tranquil nights in Caspe. We can manage 2 nights here just for the proximity of the beach and large, clean service facilities. Probably suits families better than 2, 60  adults. I hope the train service doesn't run through the night."
77283,2016531,4,Mirennn,27/06/2022,"Seasonal camping, usually open from Easter to October, about 6 months, closed in winter. There are different types of bungalows, the camping area is good, there are many residents (no problem), family atmosphere. If the campsite is full, the pool is too small for so many people. Good location next to the beach and the promenade. The services clean them often."
77283,1925745,2,Margotescargot,28/05/2022,"Very beautiful and well maintained campsite as far as the gîtes are concerned but far from being the same thing on the camper side, we were disappointed, if you want tranquility I do not recommend because the train runs every 20 minutes and even at night ."

77283,1755689,3,PatrickNykamp,14/02/2022,"The place made a very good impression, but is closed until April 8th for renovations. Too bad, we would have liked to have stayed."

77283,1512988,4,Buffon,25/08/2021,"A very correct site. Updated and clean bathrooms, pool with slides. Miniclub. Big pitches and lovely people."
77283,1349911,4,mariaeibar,22/07/2021,"Freaking out with previous comments. It is expensive high season Ac 2adults 2children less 4 years 67 €. Swimming pool ok with umbrellas, we have gone with baby without shade problem. The only thing that slides the floor. Animation ok. Miniclub from 6a. Penalty that minors are not admitted. You cross and there is the beach. Showers and toilets ok and they are not old. Most shaded pitches (some not) Pedestrian bungalow area in front."

77283,1268832,4,papylemn,21/06/2021,"Just a detail to access the campsite with a motorhome, specify it well with your GPS, otherwise follow the station to pass under the railway line otherwise the height of the passages 2m20 to 2m50 !!!"
77283,1268822,4,papylemn,21/06/2021,"After reading the previous comments I said to myself what kind of mess I got myself into? After 7 days and 7 nights including a weekend I must not be in the same place large 70m2 pitches, silence at 24h, great block restaurant sanitary constantly refreshed and yet invasion of premises for the weekend but they are at home! We will come back"
77283,1214469,1,navy77,24/05/2021,"Continued ... finally, the rotten ghetto is watched by security guards, a militia, which keeps watch at every corner of the aisle after 10:30 p.m.! especially when there are French people !!! for the locals with their locations all year round it is the great tolerance !!! TV at full blast all the time and dog barking but must above all say nothing !!! if you want a successful vacation, look elsewhere !!!"
77283,1214468,1,navy77,24/05/2021,"to flee ! ghetto 3/4 occupied by locals who confuse camping and social housing. bbq competition in the middle of the aisle, fire safety not respected, maximum promiscuity, pitches to the nearest cm, only concrete, a gross pool without pediluve, forced to go out twice a day because some people confuse the pool with their toilet ... beware of 7m CCs because concrete aisles at right angles"
77283,1037035,5,ELDISCOVERO,09/09/2020,"My wife I stayed here for one night. I do not understand the previous comments, because really if I could have put more than 5 stars I would have done it. the pool is excellent, the entertainment is top notch the sanitary facilities extremely clean, it is very quiet and the welcome is perfect. we paid 19 € for one night and a pitch and we will surely go back on the way back"
77283,1003847,1,iker09,26/08/2020,"The price of the campsite is expensive for what it offers, small pitches, old toilets, a small pool and it seems that you were going to cook there. The owner or the one who runs this campsite is rude. There are many and better alternatives in the area."
77283,566899,2,graniia,21/07/2019,"Small plots with sink in the streets that smells like pipes, small pool and cramped. We didn't like it very much."
77283,310582,1,monster17,01/08/2018,"A refugee camp at 67 € / night. Run away ! No grass, no bush, no fence, tents touching each other, screaming tv, horde of wild children, alley serving as gutters, excrement of animals. 30 years of camping I have never seen such a mess, tomorrow I run away at the first hour and I stick you photos of this slum?"

77298,1151497,3,Piolin,14/03/2021,"The place is very spacious with many tables and barbecues, at least a couple of fountains and a chemical toilet. Ample parking but a little inclined so it is necessary to wedge the van. Only at the top can the terrain be a little more level."
77298,256847,3,thedinguedu17,21/05/2018,"Drinking water, toilets, tables, barbecue, and plenty of room for tents. small flat there is the passage on the road, and the parking lot in the middle of the night."

77339,3022838,5,Rayo-Relampago,26/07/2023,"Spectacular place to sleep, with a sandy beach next to it and rocks in case you don't want sand. There are plenty of small parking lots along the road, so you can choose the one you like best"
77339,2634847,4,ElectroBaer,02/04/2023,"(VW T5, 03/27/23) Nice place with lots of parking space, but unfortunately very crowded with large to huge mobile homes, some of which also set up a lot outside. There are a few smaller parking spaces further back, it was more relaxed there, but unfortunately the network there was not good."
77339,2571172,5,mandyzuber,07/02/2023,"Don't come, it's too crowded!!!"
77339,2537991,5,Tobiga,02/01/2023,"Super spot right on the sea stayed here for 2 nights, the police drove by twice a day and just looked. Sman always has a really nice afterglow and a great sunrise in the evening"
77339,2530495,5,JamesAshby,28/12/2022,Nice park up with lovely views. Plenty of space all the way along the road with no restrictions. Stayed a few nights - night one we were only van in our bit until late. Cars and boats arrived at about 4am and were v noisy. Was also loads of litter - we filled a whole black sack up. Please pick up after yourselves :( Moved after night one and much better - right on the beach - tidier and quieter.
77339,2524447,5,TinaKidney,19/12/2022,"brilliant place to stay. I can see why some people would not be comfortable.  we drove off the road opposite side to the see, and with a few stones, we levelled nicely and had a great night sleep and woke to  beautiful magical morning.
would definitely stay again."
77339,2524006,1,livingPacolife,18/12/2022,We didn’t like this P4N (or surrounding places).  About 200 UFO type of campers all packed together. Where we parked at 4:00 and  6:00 people came past us with boats and jetski’s so no good night sleep. It all depends what you are looking for in a spot but this wasn’t for us.
77339,2353881,5,ldanes,09/09/2022,"All along the road there are plenty of places facing the sea to park, many other vans were there at the same time as us. On the side of the road but you don't hear it much, it's perfect!"
77339,2274009,4,Alcacp,20/08/2022,"We made a technical stop to eat at this place. there were many more caravans, where they were camping without problem. Beach very close, good place to spend a day."

77339,1566803,5,eilisenda,10/09/2021,"We have spent a very comfortable night. Views of Tabarca and the sunrise. Stone coast with what are great crabeater and goggles. Be careful with sleeping in the extreme car parks where it is forbidden to spend the night, there if they are fined, many ACs along the way, there is room and if you do not exceed at night they do not tell you anything. We will be back!"
77339,1522223,2,Rolotrip,28/08/2021,The location sent us to a parking lot for the trailers to unload the boats / motorcycles. Very prohibited to park there. We arrived at night and did not see the signal. The police pass a lot and from 7 am there is a lot of hustle and bustle with trailers and boats. We look forward to the fine for sure.

Several small beaches or great ""rocks"" for swimming and snorkeling. Caution, do not sit too far away from the vehicle at night or when ventilating.

77339,1112517,5,Quiquovan,05/11/2020,"We stayed several nights, not exactly in this place that gives the coordinates, but next to it. The whole stretch has many spaces where to stop with the camper. There were so many. Right on the sea, very calm and beautiful."

77399,296583,3,Rond58,22/07/2018,A very nice quiet spot as described. Clean open toilets as the parking is attached to the cemetery. This morning we view the castle which is free to enter. The surrounding hills make an ideal ambience.  Sadly the access angles may be a challenge for vehicles with a long rear overhang. Otherwise perfect.

77527,3187236,5,RafaBS,20/08/2023,"5 stars, because, make no mistake, it is not a resort, it does not have water on the plot... but, they are very large, perfect for large motorhomes, impeccable cleanliness, the treatment of the staff is very correct. You have to walk a little to the beach, which is great. To come back, . Thank you"
77527,3160766,4,Frankzu,16/08/2023,Very large campsite. We found a place without a reservation. Shaded pitch with towels. Clean bathrooms. Lots of services. You can hear the trains go by and play. The nearby beach is not beautiful.
77527,3029517,5,Rico28480,27/07/2023,"Very “family” campsite, the toilets are cleaned every day, a beautiful supervised swimming pool, beach 500 m away, the best for the price!

77527,3022563,3,Felix_Hendrix,26/07/2023,"33 € for two people. without electricity with a small car. Okay for a night (or two) but otherwise nothing special. The beach is within walking distance, loud and honking trains often pass by and that until late in the evening."
77527,2935426,3,IKERMAN,08/07/2023,"Basic camping, a lot of noise, children screaming running late at night, adults leaving the bar the same way without respecting that there are people sleeping. train track stuck and beeping, very old bathrooms, beach far away. You can enter facilities by paying a ticket to use swimming pools, etc. the people of the campsite pay for some facilities. which is impossible to bathe in the pool of the amount of people"
77527,2868618,5,lavud,18/06/2023,Perfect for a stopover.
77527,2825498,4,Fernandorit,06/06/2023,"Camping with the basics, very normal, good value for money. The beach is just a few meters away but you have to go outside the campsite. Quiet family we used it on the way and it was great for us."

77527,2760825,4,PuschelBenny,18/05/2023,A very nicely situated campsite. Price/performance ratio very good. We are now paying €21 for 24 hours for a 2-person camper including electricity and a dog in the off-season. Quiet apart from the passing trains and pigeons. There are still enough free places. It is worth staying 2-3 nights. We'd love to come back.
77527,2693380,2,IrisVar83,24/04/2023,Very quiet in general but a lot of noise because of the train which passes every quarter of an hour. The toilets are a bit outdated… and then the price: €34 for 1 night with electricity! The restaurant is really not great… the prawns were still frozen. Access to the beach is quite far.

77555,518372,1,regardsuk,17/06/2019,"Although the site is in a great location and the nearby beach beautiful our visit was ruined by the unfriendliness of the seasonal campers on the site. We made the mistake of pitching next to the children’s playground which as the evening went on , became more popular with the children of the seasonal campers who visit each weekend. The adults / parents gathered in the tents away from the playground whilst the children played music, played on the swings , screamed at each other , wrestled, kicked the football against the wire fence. To begin with okay it’s a playground, at 12.30 at night not acceptable. We asked them to be quiet several times and they did eventually leave the playground. The next morning we packed up to leave as some of the fathers stood close by with their hands on hips trying to look threatening. Very intimidating. It’s a shame the parents weren’t around the night before to control the behaviour of their children. The camp staff were not interested in our displeasure. Also had a problem buying items from the shop using. Bank card. Because it didn’t show in their bank straight away a member of staff came to our van and demanded that we pay again in cash. We tried to explain it may take several days as it was international transfer and it was weekend. But she would not accept this, we therefore had to give her €21 in cash. Very bad experience"

During the day there were some local people walking their dogs but at night it was very quiet. Lots of space to park but not very flat in all places Not too much shade however but the weather was perfect when we were there, not to hot/cold"

77685,2473946,2,Fredyzaragoza,31/10/2022,"The parking spaces are narrow (they are for cars) so the motorhome stands out. In addition there is inclination forward, you have to put chocks.

The tap for rinsing the cassette is the same as for drinking water!!! and impossible to connect. On a slope, not wide enough, part of the vehicle is on the rolling part of the road and the grid to drain gray water 10 cm wide. Avoid. I put a star because zero does not exist"
77685,2308703,1,jlpc,27/08/2022,"It is an insufficiently wide line car park but on a quiet, slightly sloping street. I could not load clean water because of the unusual internal thread of the faucet. Good for black and you have to aim very well so that the grays fall into the narrow grid."
77685,2249022,1,MC4333,16/08/2022,"Completely agree with the opinions. Thanks, but it's not the site."
77685,2069009,1,Lebousky,13/07/2022,Fatal…..the worst thing I have found so far…::it is only valid for emptying because it is not valid for filling…..female thread for which you do not have an accessory and a mouth large enough to be able to put the butterfly coupling… not even with zip ties and duct tape… whoever designed it HAS NO IDEA.

77685,1484460,2,MC4333,19/08/2021,"Thanks for the intention, but there really are places in Burela that could be better. To drink water and empty well, but to spend the night I do not see it."
77685,1451932,1,juana1974,13/08/2021,"It gives the impression that motorhomes are not welcome in Burela. The area as such does not exist. It is a street where to park the motorhome, little more .. A shame. 10 minutes away, in San Cebrian, a spectacular area."

77685,618451,2,Naju,11/08/2019,Parking on the street parallel to the main street ... with a filling tap ... not far from the town but downhill ... then you have to climb hehehe.
77685,614857,3,ABASMM,10/08/2019,Parking on the street marked only allowed AC. Very well signposted (you have to enter the town where Hospital indicates). Gray water emptying is allowed and there is water intake.
77685,606895,3,Naezba,07/08/2019,"It is an online car park in a quiet street, it has no containers nearby, the source has a rough female, which makes it difficult to connect to fill water, there is space to throw gray and black water ... it is not a bad place to spend a night , is near the port, and if you stop or miss the restaurant de la lonxa ... all delicious ..."
77685,556940,4,Edelwdavid,16/07/2019,It is very good for black and gray discharge. The paste is at the time of filling. It is necessary to have a male thread coupling set since the tap is female thread. I could not say how many inches.

77698,1519254,3,magamiguel,27/08/2021,"Narrow access in 6 km and a half like all the roads from here. If someone comes from the front, it is very complicated with a motorhome. The last meters to access the parking lot are in poor condition. I left it 300 m. before. Walking access to the best and most spectacular ravine to the left of the door that appears in the photo. On the way you go to Ciutadella in 13 km."

You can park, and pecnotar, but in Spain it is illegal to camp on the street .. knowing the laws you will have no problems .."

The operator is super nice and explains everything about the place. The night's sleep is unique. Very nice view over the valleys and mountains to the sea and Denia. In the village of bakers, vegetables and butchers etc. we will be back."
77704,1765638,4,fredletaz,25/02/2022,Despite a somewhat narrow access (it's okay with a 7m50 trailer) a great discovery this pretty campsite set back from the coast with a superb view of the valley. Warm welcome with good advice for walks and visits. Frequented by many hikers calm and setting. Small but clean and heated sanitary facilities. If you have a big cc we will give you a suitable plot.

There are only two stars because, contrary to all information, there is no possibility of disposing of vehicles with fixed tank installations. Neither gray water nor sewage tank disposal is possible. In fact, when asked by reception, we were asked to dump our wastewater directly into nature. (Which of course we refused)"

Ideal for going up to Núria with the zip from Queralbs or hiking in the area. Queralbs a small but charming town; the church of Sant Jaume is very cool.

AC and campers arriving at late at night, screaming, entering the parking lot faster than normal, excrement and papers. There is a bit of civility lacking in the roadsters.

77716,3277590,1,quimrs,09/09/2023,"The real price ends up being double that of the web. They charge €11 per system for ""management fees"" whether you book on the web or register at reception. They did not want to give us the bill despite having paid, claiming that they gave it when you leave the campsite. Lots of swimming pools and entertainment but fair service facilities"
77716,3101855,3,SimonMacDonald,08/08/2023,Expensive site with lots of mosquitoes due to the damp/humid conditions. The pitches were nice but unable to enjoy outside as the mosquitoes were so bad. Toilets clean and useable. Site restaurant and bar seemed like the only place to eat and drink in the area. Friendly staff and good food/beer. Maybe more aimed for people wanting to see the nature reserve.
77716,3024844,4,valoufr,26/07/2023,Fair price in high season. The slides are quite nice and well supervised. During our visit they were laying a synthetic lawn all around. Rather narrow camper pitch. Lots of people in summer so if you want a small peaceful campsite this is not the one to choose. Far from the beach if you want to walk there.
77716,2915822,1,northcraftervan,02/07/2023,"If you don't go to bungalows, they don't bother to give you many explanations about the campsite, there were thousands of mosquitoes, the bathrooms were very dirty full of dead mosquitoes on the floor and the WC was horrible!! We went by van 2 adults + 1 child + dog 3 nights €140 very expensive for what it is, to go to the beach there is a very comfortable bike ride but it is far away, the pools are fine but with the number of bungalows there are, I suppose that in the middle of summer they will be very crowded The floor of the pool is another horror to walk barefoot. The person who designed it must be a fakir. In short, I would never go back, from 1 to 10 I give it a 2"
77716,2754357,5,bulli103,16/05/2023,"25 degrees the sun is shining, mobile home all inclusive and swimming pool for 2 people 18 euros...you can't complain about that...but if you arrive in the August heat including crowds and of course let yourself be ripped off, it's your own fault.... there is another way.."
77716,2696872,3,Lothschuetz,25/04/2023,"It is currently being remodeled. The sanitary facilities are renewed and clean. The pitches are quite large and separated by hedges. Each seat has a brick sink and clothesline. We only paid €17.20 for two people with a small van. Besides us there are only two other campers here. Absolutely okay in the off-season. Beaches, the Ebro estuary and the nautical port are within easy cycling distance."
77716,2036088,1,Zebra131,04/07/2022,"Aging, dirty and poorly maintained campsite. 40€ per night is way too expensive. We totally advise against it. PLEASE NOTE: the reception closes at 8 p.m."

77716,1863516,3,Marinamp81,01/05/2022,"Camping Cap Fun but not at all like the franchise, certainly being renovated because the campsite is a bit in its own juice! The restaurant is horrible, poor quality food but on the other hand nothing to say about the Home and the staff they are all adorable! It's a shame because the location is exceptional, really magnificent and perfect for bike rides and the beach! Hoping that Cap Fun improves the standard of the campsite a little!"

I agree with the rules but I recommend a change of them if the campsite is half empty for a little more money (I do not say free) can offer something else !! no car services, dirty bathrooms and normal pool, little empathy la xica de rc"
77716,1454087,3,JORDI2EURA,14/08/2021,"I confirm all comments of narrowness of plots and streets. As for the services for motorhomes these do not exist, you have to ask and wait for an employee to attend to you by opening a sewer and removing a hose from a warehouse. That's why it's best to go to Sant Jaume. The pool, normal."
77716,1443982,2,dmarin8,12/08/2021,"Camping without more. Cheap, fair pitches, with many activities. Silence and covid rules are not respected. Near the mouth and very wide beaches with a lot of space and few people."
77716,1426366,2,Anna_Ra,09/08/2021,"On a positive point it is cheap. But the pitches are very close together, silence is not respected, and also the reception is chaos. We did not have cash and therefore they did not want us / they could make the entry and exit card with the car, we could not rent bikes ... We were there for a few hours, but in the end we left. I do not recommend it if you are looking for tranquility."
77716,1304514,2,Calanoa,07/07/2021,"The plots are attached to each other and there is no privacy or space. The hour of silence is not respected. Compliance with anti-covid measures is not controlled. The pools very good, with slides for the children. It also has a soccer field and they let you have the ball. As a positive point they let us go out later and use the pool until we left after eating."
77716,1281827,2,laalqueria,27/06/2021,"First expensive. More than € 30 night for 2 people. If the services are good, they are paid. Filling with water: you have to look for an employee who takes you to a point of the facilities and refills with a hose that could not fit more dirt. Gray cast: next to the hose, they lift a sewer trap. Emptying of blacks: in bathrooms, very clean. Restaurant: good menu, excellent service"
77716,1278418,4,Davidal86,26/06/2021,"Camping with all services, swimming pool with slides, perfect for children. The only downside is the treatment between workers, there was no good vibes between those at the reception, a shame since the customer is the one who loses."

77716,1153381,1,Tusky,18/03/2021,"Too bad the owner is not nice to deal with, she is always angry with everyone. Before this there are other campsites where just seeing you are already with a smile on their lips, where the toilets are clean, the pool clean, such as eucalyptus or the tancada. He is losing customers year after year, a real shame. Each year the stay is shortened."

Not really quite as the nearby living dogs bark all night long."

The cars that stop at night are young people smoking and taking drugs because there is a disco right next door. I would not stay the night because sleeping near drunk and drugged youth is not a good idea. To see the sunset is fine."
77763,2387450,3,MarieKate2022,20/09/2022,Free parking along the entire promenade. Up to 5 meters WoMo no problem. Longer WoMo could - like us - stand across overnight. Parking just off the named bar was actually screepy. A young man had walked past us noticeably often (acted as if he was jogging past) and was always looking at the WoMo. He then whistled in a strange way. Are then parked near Mc Donalds

The issue is that it is used for parking motorhomes in general, that is, people from the town who have one leave it there and it takes up space for travelers like us who are passing through. the service area is new and very good. Opposite there is a covered shed where, if you come with children, you can play ball or go rollerblading."

The negative point is that some vehicles of young people appeared with the music in high volume, even so they were only for a short time. The road to get there is pretty good."
77805,1022490,4,Su.susa,03/09/2020,The way up is long but the views of the city and surrounding towns are very cool. No shadow that the wind blows
77805,973187,4,marionleon,17/08/2020,"Magnificent view, place full of history. The road is bumpy, but it passes by going slowly. On the other hand, if you want to spend a quiet night, go your way! It's a gathering place for revelers who stayed until 4 a.m. on a Sunday night."
77805,882731,4,Denduck,20/07/2020,"Splendid view, only for motorhomes and vans who are not afraid to climb up there, because yes it climbs hard for 7 km on a road, say tired."
77805,860020,5,billes,11/07/2020,"Incredible views, the road to climb quite bumpy. the impressive fort. the very quiet night to sleep"
77805,776198,4,Reubennz,04/02/2020,"Very beautiful location - road is bumpy, but handled fine in our campervan. Some other cars appear and go during the night. Now, the directions with Google are bloody insane unless you direct it to avoid the walking tracks. Basically, take the Camino de San Cristobal road and you'll be fine."
77805,750179,4,wherearejandb,05/12/2019,"Gorgeous views! We stayed one night on 16NOV19 and had a nice time. The mountain is a popular spot (especially on the weekend, which is when we were there) for trail runners, cyclists, photographers, and the occasional misfits, so you won’t have a whole lot of privacy or quiet (even into the wee hours of the morning). But in our opinion, the view and the abandoned fort next to the parking more than make up for it. A word of caution: do not use Google maps for routing, as this will take you through Casco Antiguo and along walking trails that are decidedly not roads. Join the road on Carr. De Artica and follow it all the way up."
77805,730708,4,Daviddu33,26/10/2019,"Magical place overlooking Pamplona. Frequented by night owls, lovers. Presence of a bin. Road slightly damaged. Climb on the heights about 1 km after the houses."
77805,383580,4,Barouville,28/09/2018,"Nice location, very little room flat, but hey we get there. Very hectic place all night, between the soldiers in maneuver, the visitors of sunset, the deliverymen of bins, the lovers, the party-goers ... Better to sleep in center town, at least we know what to expect If access is not a problem, heavy goods vehicles pass without problems."
77805,333082,5,krissmith,14/08/2018,"The road to go up is patched and some potholes but frankly it is done. At the top the view is beautiful and clear. there is a lot of room to move up and down the explanatory panel, but also a little less place behind the antennas but again it does. otherwise a lot of people at night to see the view. Fort Tour is to be done too. Thank you for this beautiful night."
77805,267082,2,mioulotte01,11/06/2018,"So yes the view is superb 360 degrees, but that's it. Road very difficult access classic camper like us, the platform is relatively small, at worst we can put under the pylons but hey if you want to sleep must have the holds and not fear the wind."
77822,1692711,1,Luna45,18/11/2021,"The park is spectacular, but it is not a place to spend the night. Right at the entrance of the road there is a sign that prohibits sleeping and camping and if you still continue entering, a few meters away it reminds us again that it is a natural park and is prohibited."
77822,1164999,5,astralissomnium,03/04/2021,Precious! Perfect for staying there longer and enjoying nature. but we were in April h at night it was too cold with the wind for dinner outside. The last few meters with the car are like entering paradise in spring with all the flowers.

77822,522553,5,sackaufzack,20/06/2019,"If I could give 6 dying, this place deserves it. The parking attendant went in the evening around 21 o'clock and waved me nicely. The next morning, when I was 10, I came up the street and he looked grumpy. The night was spectacular and the views terrific. If you are near go there !!"
77822,439308,3,Andiman,12/03/2019,"After two nights a parking attendant came and told us that it is forbidden to stay here, the place is terrific. We parked 300m in front of the cottage."
77822,427840,4,reggiethevan,09/02/2019,"Amazing views and an almost too quiet night spent here. We loved the morning fog- very spectacular. As the directions suggest, continue along the road for about 500m even after your gps has told you you’ve arrived. You’ll be too low down on a road to have arrived so carry on until you get to a road to your right which is a curvy bend, almost completely back on itself. The track changes terrain at this point but it’s certainly doable. Wind your way through the pines till you’re up the top and you can see a rotunda hut. Not a lot of flat space up there but do your best because the morning views are worth it!"
77822,399795,5,ju073,27/10/2018,Viewpoint next to an observation hut. Nice view of the Sierra de las Nieves and El Borgo. The road leading to it is a road in good condition.
77849,2863125,1,jonatanpardo,17/06/2023,"This campsite is not for motorhomes. They only have 3 rotation plots. It has low trees and very complicated turns for large motorhomes. I do not recommend plot C26 and surroundings behind the restaurant because there is an annoying fan that works 24 hours. We prefer other types of campsites. It cost us €72 with ACSI, 2 nights with 2 adults and 3 girls."

77903,2548491,3,JamesAshby,10/01/2023,A fine place to stop over for a night to empty and fill for free. Lots of room and plenty of other vans when we were there. Around a 15 minute walk into the town where there's a Spar if needed. We had a car turn up around 1am and sit with its engine running which woke us and is always a bit unnerving but moved on after around half hour. Other than that no problems. Quite a bit of litter though :(

Before that I was the only one at the lake for 2 days. I picked up rubbish that I saw today came from the locals. Still good if everyone collects a little. For dog owners: avoid the place with the pine trees at the moment.

77906,791950,3,ABusAndBeyond,06/03/2020,It was super quiet and lovely location. Pick your spots wisely though as there’s broken glass around. When we arrived someone in a car was there and they took a dump right out in the open. Gross bum wiped tissues are in some areas. I’m told a lot of wild camp spots in Spain can be like this. We did clear the area we camped in up and there are big bins near the entrance. Wish others were more considerate. It was quiet though and pretty when it’s clean.
77906,786690,4,pticlod,25/02/2020,"Very good place to preserve. we arrived on a sunny sunday late afternoon and it was full of people. but from 8 p.m. we were alone, and the place relatively clean. very little waste considering the number of people who were present."

We were 6/8 camtars, caravans and ludos. no worries with the police, we asked the lady at the sanctuary bar who told us there was no problem. big negative point in the middle of that ... the wind ...

78099,1225753,4,boscox,30/05/2021,"Very quiet place to spend the night, we just did it on the esplanade where the birdwatching booth is. For putting some paste the esplanade is not regular but you can adjust it and leave it very level."
78099,733692,4,fidelecastor,30/10/2019,Flat space a little near the road but very little traffic at night. Lots of hiking around.
78099,732633,5,PeterLefty,28/10/2019,"I arrived by bicycle. I camped in a tent. Water, tables, but stuck to the road. The head of the enclosure a charm."
78099,451086,5,eglantine95,08/04/2019,"The entrance to the parking lot is located between the guides office on the left and the small canal on the right, beautiful place to see the heron, the Sultane hen, the crecerelette falcon, at the church, stayed for 2 nights without problem"
78099,392492,4,Inmac,13/10/2018,A good place to spend the night. In our case we went from Mérida to Madrid. The people of the interpretation center very nice. The toilets available very clean. Opposite the pool bar. Illuminated area at night and very close to the town. Some traffic on the road but bearable. It seems that the city council is considering putting an area here for Ac.
78099,390424,5,Linasb,09/10/2018,"Perfect place to park and spend the night. It has very clean bathrooms and the girl who works in the center facilitates everything with her kindness. Garbage container, near the town and sell some delicious cheeses. Let's continue respecting where they let us be. Thank you"
78099,271055,4,BobL,19/06/2018,"Stayed here for 3 nights and absolutely no problems. THE woman in the Information Centre couldn't have been nicer and allowed us to have buckets of water from the hosepipe to fill our tanks. The toilets are open when the Centre is open.
We took our motorhome to the various hides which allowed us to stay all day.
Obviously road noise as adjacent to main road but no loutish behaviour. Fishing creek"
78163,2622560,4,Cruizer76,24/03/2023,"All alone from 6 p.m. Enough space for parking. Access a bit bumpy. Think always feasible for rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive. For front-wheel drive vehicles, it may be difficult on the way back due to the incline and gravel."
78163,2452013,5,Travelcrazynl,19/10/2022,euh... Wow the hike is fantastic.  Great easy walk around but with spectacular views. parking is flat and the road is easily doable also for a 1985 ducato hymer
78163,1749711,5,lavieenrogeta,07/02/2022,"Absolute calm. A spectacular site. Of course, as has already been said, it is cold. Do not leave garbage, please."
78163,1722355,5,rufach,01/01/2022,"We slept there on the nights of December 30th and 31st, January 1st and 2nd. We alone, in absolute silence, and with cold, is a very cold place. In winter we recommend this place, during the day there is movement, but it is very quiet at night, we do not know if in summer as well. Nice walking routes around the area. Highly recommended in winter if you want to stay quiet. Respect the environment ..."
78163,1675228,5,Carivan,02/11/2021,"Parking with many places to visit the wonderful aqueduct. People spend the day there with cars, they take out tables and chairs. Very family friendly, and very quiet at night."
78163,1314077,4,pauestfer,11/07/2021,"Good shade for parking. overnight without problems. nice route, but no source"
78163,1279983,4,OlgaJad,27/06/2021,A very nice place with super quiet shade but very dirty. Let's see if we learn how to collect and carry our garbage. Nature must be taken care of.
78163,1179848,4,JuanMncd,26/04/2021,Very good site is missing that people are not so dirty.
78163,1117150,4,TeamGG,23/11/2020,"If you like wild parking this is for you. Although we are 8mtrs long, 2.3mtrs wide and 3mtrs high and we made it through, it is very narrow and there are some water ditches and small walls on sides of track that make it very tricky. Surface bumpy, stoney. Not for the nervous driver. But easy access to the tunnels and viaduct. Very quiet night. Please take your rubbish away with you."
78163,1062451,4,pik3aquer,21/09/2020,"Nice to walk to the aqueduct the next day. Superb ride! Quiet night, nice setting, however. Nice and quiet car park (after 4km of track he could!) However a lot of PQ after a few meters. The adjoining walk is really magnificent with the crossing of a Roman aqueduct and tunnels in the rock."
78163,828448,5,Jose-Pepe,18/06/2020,"Fantastic place to spend the day and night. Very quiet, surrounded by a lot of green, with a couple of hiking trails and an aqueduct to visit nearby. It is reached by a dirt road that is worth doing. We spend the night alone but during the day many people to do the routes. We were very comfortable. We recommend it. Flat place. Let's keep nature in its order."
78163,735665,1,salolimu,01/11/2019,"We turned around because when 1km is left it is very steep, narrow and the road that becomes a road ends."
78163,721584,4,peremerito,14/10/2019,Very quiet place
78163,705886,5,peremerito,27/09/2019,"Ideal place to spend a night in the middle of nature, without services"
78163,666080,4,stifmacuin,29/08/2019,"We arrived late to see the cut rock aqueduct, it became dark and we stayed there. Plain and quiet place with the shade of the pine forest in the morning, no sign of prohibition, there is a nearby stream so there are countless mosquitoes."
78198,1832259,2,AnaErandio,17/04/2022,"We spent the night of Holy Thursday without incident, alone and quiet. Beforehand, we ate pintxos in various taverns in the old town. Good Friday morning we buy bread and drink coffee. The fountain at the beginning of the street where the parking is located is very useful."
78198,1827092,1,LaBichoVan,16/04/2022,"Eye! strange people around. some gypsies who had previously been watching us have been approaching our van when we were leaving. As we have realized we have returned and they have already gone the other way, watching us at all times. very very rare as much as we have gone."
78198,1569177,1,mofotraveller,11/09/2021,"Terrible experience. We arrived Saturday night, quite late. In the town there was quite a nightlife. This area looked quiet. But once parked, when we were half asleep, a group of kids came and started shaking the car. What a scare we went through. We left there instantly with a heart attack"
78198,1514829,4,nerinasacristan,26/08/2021,"All right. We have spent one night here, and very quiet. It is a flat area, without many people, and with a fountain to fill water. He did the show for us."
78198,1124301,3,The_Nomadic_Chalet,27/12/2020,"The place is dirty but you can park quietly. We had young people coming out of their sports class until 10pm afterwards, just background sound of the highway but nothing disturbing."
78198,449235,3,anaygua,05/04/2019,"(3/31/19) Very quiet area to spend the night, covered swimming pools just next door, has a supermarket nearby and the center of town at 5 min walk. It is a good place to start the visit to Urbasa."

78198,415730,5,macrostigma2B,24/12/2018,Calm
78198,294108,1,robinboo75,20/07/2018,It's like parking in the street without more
78198,277368,2,Lude,29/06/2018,"It is a parking lot. It seems a quiet place, but we have not stayed, since it is a street in front of the private houses."
78198,266183,2,pompaspompaelo,10/06/2018,"It is a parking area, it is not an area or place for future area, it has no installation for emptying, if it is true that there is a source, it is a quiet area and has nearby covered pools."
78198,256757,5,goterika,21/05/2018,"We have already done some kdd in this car park and very well, it is in the same town and as a starting point to go up to visit the Urbasa natural park."
78207,1565811,4,alexmika49,10/09/2021,"Intermarche car park with water and free emptying for cash on site, a laundromat. Avoid going through the city narrow passage for motorhome, quiet night ... Plus a magnificent view ..."
