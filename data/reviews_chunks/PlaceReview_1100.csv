I would repeat without hesitation."
24908,3120179,5,AnnaMoclo,11/08/2023,"We stayed in the eucalyptus forest area, the whole next morning the air conditioning smelled of eucalyptus, for that alone it deserves 5 stars. The place is very quiet and beautiful, we arrived late and the gambling dens did not bother us, we had dinner at the Antolín de Navia cider house, a 10 Just remember that it is not a camping area, there were many campers with tables, chairs and clothes lines, it is not good."

Next to a lake, a beach (dogs are prohibited), a park for children and several beach bars, cars pass by until 12:00-1:00 in the morning because of these.

24908,3010793,2,indina,24/07/2023,"The place is very good but a family of about 30 arrived and they looked like a mess, so we went to the one that is a little earlier. It has beach bars and is among eucalyptus trees."
24908,2991650,5,zucche,20/07/2023,"Very beautiful place. We pull into the trees before the car park at the end, which is quieter and has plenty of space. We stayed two nights very quiet, it is close to the beach, and a good walk around. And at night we went to the pasodoble bar, which has good music and cider! 5G Vodafone to work perfect"
24908,2962658,3,marzar,14/07/2023,Car park was currently closed due to white lining.  We didn't stop but it looks like they are possibly putting in dedicated spaces for motorhomes but not entirely sure.  Plenty of available parking in the surrounding area.
24908,2949465,5,malucars,11/07/2023,"Excellent place, beach 100 meters away, restaurants 40 meters away and playground 50 meters away, ideal with children, talk to the local police and if chairs, awning tables, etc. are not taken out, you can stay overnight"

24908,2243490,5,Jcri,15/08/2022,Good place to spend the day and night. Several beach bars and bathrooms during daytime. About 4 beach showers and 2 sources of drinking water. I liked the beach but bathing is complicated in this area because it is very exposed. Before reaching the beach bars on the right hand side there is a eucalyptus grove where there are several Furgos roll camping and it seems that there are no problems. Trash bins. a 10
24908,2220753,4,uprootedvan,12/08/2022,"Nice space but it had minimal 4G so we left. If you're not reliant on having phone signal, great spot!"

24908,1667663,5,ViztorRivas,29/10/2021,"Highly recommended out of season! I was staying one night with my van and no problem. You can park practically on the beach, just a few meters from the sea, and there are plenty of places. Next door there are 2 or 3 beach bars, which is cool to be able to have a drink or dinner. Also, as I have gone at the end of October, they closed early and there was no annoying noise, only the waves of the sea"

24908,1368826,1,JJunior,26/07/2021,We went to spend the afternoon on the beach and around 6pm the police invited us to leave if we did not want to be fined. A shame as we will not be returning to this site.

24908,1346772,4,africabicho,21/07/2021,"I spent a night with my van among the trees that are just before reaching the beach bars. The place is very beautiful, there were 2 other vans staying overnight. The police passed by a couple of times and they didn't even look at us. The only bad thing is that the beach bar has a lot of atmosphere and cars do not stop passing continuously until quite late. Otherwise very good place to spend the night"
24908,1239883,4,Quicolas,06/06/2021,Beautiful area next to the beach. It is a pity that there are always many cars and the squares are small. There are several trails to the town and a walk along the river. Cool

24908,563244,3,Aquadrathalbe,19/07/2019,"Beautiful place but only in the low season or better in winter, if you have a mobile. A van or bulli is great, but if you're bigger than a car parking lot, you should not drive in the street."
24908,558707,4,Magtou,17/07/2019,Perfect for picnic there are swings and games for children. You can shower ... you can sleep but not wild enough for my taste

24908,330859,4,d.l.t,13/08/2018,"Perfect place to arrive late in the afternoon to park without problems and enjoy the beach, either in the afternoon or the next morning. The days of a lot of sun seems to fill up a lot. It has showers on the beach and toilets, which are closed at night, and picnic"
24908,327472,1,danymh,11/08/2018,"Super narrow, for the day full of cars, once inside, very difficult to turn around, if you see cars on the sides before entering, better not to get into"

24932,1554586,4,lluisrp78,06/09/2021,"Camping very close to the town of Rupit where you can access it through a path that leaves from the same campsite and about 5-10 min walk. Simple camping, without great luxuries, but correct, clean and with the necessary services. We stayed one night with AC on a plot surrounded by trees and the children had a great time, especially in the pool. The swings should be renewed due to their age."
24932,1454543,3,chlomkell,14/08/2021,"Very pricey, €47.50 for myself only and my dog, plus van. Its the most expensive campsite I've ever been to. However, it's super peaceful and beautiful. Up in the mountains with fresh bread and nice clean facitilies. Nice for a treat!"

We spent 6 nights here in total peace. A typical bar with a good restaurant is integrated into the camping area. Somo beach can be easily reached in 20 minutes on foot. We'd love to come back."
24943,3223331,4,albertoyjennifer,27/08/2023,"Quiet area. Nice location, and flat terrain. Enough places. A couple of bathrooms with outdoor showers, if they had been interior I would have given it 5 stars. Sinks with uncomfortable faucets. The boy who received us was quite nice."
24943,3197383,4,ScottCSchank,22/08/2023,"Perfectly adequate site. Not much here, but we knew that going in (and don’t need more). Two clean bathrooms and areas to walk the dogs. Safe, clean, and orderly. The price is right."

Use of the washing machine on the campsite is ok, but not the washrooms. With the bike you are in 10 minutes on the beach. With the ferry, on which you can take your bikes with you (€10 pp return) you can get to Santander. Good value for money."

24943,3021056,4,JCPORFIRIO,25/07/2023,"For a modern and paid area, it is regrettable that, of the 66 places(?), few have electricity points nearby and only one access point for water and flushing, far from the places with electricity, which makes it uncomfortable for more than a couple of nights. Otherwise, everything works as expected."
24943,3019320,5,vivicampers,25/07/2023,"Good quiet place, with two bathrooms, and outdoor showers to give you water on very hot days, 11 euros a night without electricity, the best thing is the guy who runs it, a certain Carlos, a very attentive, friendly person, you can take out tables and chairs, a spacious plot"

24943,2871690,4,Home79,19/06/2023,"Signing up at the machine is a bit tricky. No languages selectable. Places up to 8m ok, but a bit too narrow, but quite flat. Good access protected by roller shutter. Good supply and disposal. The monastery bell rings at 8 a.m. Road traffic unremarkable. Very quiet at night. Good place to visit Santander. The best way is to take the ferry (10€ with a bike, there and back) from Somo (approx. 2km)"

24943,2706811,1,familybusroad,29/04/2023,Arrival at 6:00 p.m. Has 2 vehicles. The area was deserted. Only 3 motorhomes on site. We ask the person on site if we can sleep there. His answer is no. Because too long. 12m.and 10m. No worries we can get to the bottom. And we leave tomorrow morning. The person told us that we had to pay 4 places for 1 vehicle. Be 44th. Out of the question.
24943,2706791,1,LesRootards,29/04/2023,"Access denied or else I am asked to pay 3 spaces to put the truck in length since we are long. while the air is empty ..... it does not matter, we found free by the sea ...."
24943,2689674,1,columpetas,23/04/2023,"The area is fine, but it is very far from the beach, forget about taking the fridge, material, etc. on foot. Apart from a campsite, next to it there is a cattle farm, with its smells. There are places closer to the beach WITHOUT USE to put this area"
24943,2651710,4,Inmalaca,08/04/2023,"Good area, very well leveled plots, bike path to tour the area. A very big drawback!! It's the showers (they're outside, that's not a problem) because the jet of cold, frozen water (there's no hot water) splits you in half... Suitable only for the very brave... they should be repaired, a shame. Either way we are thankful for the area."
24943,2526426,1,RayH.,22/12/2022,On arrival today everything was closed off with red and white ribbons and a sign closed. Too bad because the motorhome looked fine otherwise.

the restaurant at the campsite next door serves epic burgers."
24943,2341993,1,JanMx,05/09/2022,The operators are really only out to make money. Price board in Spanish only and the prices taped over. The machine also only in Spanish. For emptying the toilet 5 €. This is rip off! The faucet sprays in all directions. Catastrophe!

24943,2324014,4,Serflorido,31/08/2022,"Quiet site, I used the water services but not the showers as the water was cold. Somewhat far from Somo to walk, by car it's next door. From Somo you can then go by lancha (boat) to Santander to visit it for €5.50."
24943,2296692,4,Alcazarteam,24/08/2022,"Quiet place, a short walk of about 20 minutes to the beach (something more if you want to go to the prop with the dog). Electricity only in the first seats (about 12-18 in total). The showers are outdoors and with COLD water. The bathrooms were not particularly clean. Emptying and filling of water in good condition and comfortable. There was quite a good vibe."
24943,2291068,4,greenpeli,23/08/2022,"Quiet place, with water, filling and emptying. Electricity in some places (charged separately). Friendly staff."
24943,2267969,1,Carlosb1,19/08/2022,We did not like anything. away from everything. Expensive for the services it offers. Mosquitoes galore. Unhygienic facilities. very fair plots. Loading and unloading difficult to put the connector in the faucet. we will not repeat
24943,2246883,3,AnnaAigner95,16/08/2022,The place itself was great but the mosquitoes bit us all night. There were so many we didn't sleep.

24943,2091587,4,albagorgui,18/07/2022,"Good area, quite level, for €10 you have a change of water, both black and clean water. It is also guarded. quite correct"
24943,2090186,2,javolo65,18/07/2022,"Narrow plots. You take out the awning if you have no one next to you. The owner must have thought about the comfort of those who are inside and not about putting as many as possible. But profits rule. It is somewhat far from everything, although you can walk to the important things (beach, supermarket, pier...). The services (showers and wc) poorly planned. Two huge toilets and outdoor showers with cold water. Better than nothing, it is… but very improvable, too."
24943,2087575,2,vanpeluda,18/07/2022,"We would have liked to stay for a day, but it is too far from the town and the beach, in addition, in the middle of a heat wave, a little shade would be appreciated. We wanted to unload, you have to pay €4, we decided to go to another area that caught us on the way and we didn't have to pay."
24943,2039009,3,LindaT81,05/07/2022,"Very simple but neat. Friendly welcome. At night, the site is closed and vehicles cannot enter or exit from 11 p.m. to 9 p.m. Toilets & outdoor shower, clean. Do not cook outside. Waste water tank drain. 10-15 min. walk from the sea. In the evening cozy camping sounds from the campsite next door, not disturbing. Night/morning very quiet. Nice for a night in transit."
24943,2009999,1,Costablanca,25/06/2022,"More than an area, it is a motorhome parking because the plots are too narrow. If you have a motorhome next to your plot you cannot remove the awning. Too far from Santander and there is no public transport to go to the ferry that crosses to Santander. Not recommended if you don't have a motorcycle to get around."
24943,1893844,2,mimisl,16/05/2022,"We did not stay, there are no showers, nothing for children. A shame!!"
24943,1889828,4,Krux,14/05/2022,Good area. The only thing I didn't like is that you have to leave at 1:00 p.m. after having paid 10 euros just to spend the night. It should be 24 hours for that price.
24943,1829744,4,tobiandlaura,17/04/2022,We stayed here for two nights. Have paid €26 with electricity. Nice way to walk to the beach. All clean

24943,1761244,1,Xebiyista,20/02/2022,It was our 2nd visit. We went to eat at the restaurant and stay for one night and found it closed without notice or reason. We parked the car in the parking lot of the rest. closed and we went to eat in town. Upon returning we found that the owner of the campsite decided to annoy us by leaving his vehicle in front of our AC so that we could not leave. We had to look for him all over the campsite. We won't be back.
24943,1688042,4,Lanagomaestu,13/11/2021,"It is a normal motorhome area, with light, the bathrooms a tad fair, but they do service, nearby is the campsite with a restaurant, with good service and good food, night light 13 euros, the town of Somo is 15 min walk"

24943,1528015,1,cpatarro,29/08/2021,Customer service is not good (they are very edgy). They force you to park face-to-face and you can't take out tables or chairs. There is a sink where you can't wash dishes either. The services are basic. It is a good alternative to visit Santander (that's what saves them).
24943,1524996,5,Ibarra,28/08/2021,"Site near Somo with place and quiet € 10 / night. There is a drain and a bathroom. In addition, the restaurant at the campsite is highly recommended. Food of 10 and attitude of the staff of 11."

The showers have been canceled. The plots are large but there are hardly any shadows, it has water filling and emptying. The best thing is the hamburger that is 140m at the entrance of the campsite that is right next door, a deal of 10 and the best hamburgers to date."

It has a source and drains. € 10 night. Optional separate light"
24943,1419334,3,fonymiri,07/08/2021,"A good idea is the area attached to the campsite, similar to what there is in some places outside of Spain, it would be nice if you could use some service of the campsite, such as showers etc."
24943,1407559,3,viajeramolona,05/08/2021,"Well located area to visit the town of Somo 15 min walk. From there you can take a small boat that goes to Santander, it leaves every 30 min.

Until 23.30 you can leave with the vehicle, they will save the square for you by putting a cone on your plot. From 23.30 to 09.00 the barrier is lowered, and regarding services, enough, it has 2 large bathrooms, showers closed due to covid, I understand, change of water, two places although due to covid you can only empty or fill a vehicle.

During the first week of August the Arenal Sound is celebrated, a musical festival next to the Arenal beach. In the week of the 15th the celebrations of the Grao, neighborhood of Burriana are celebrated. The protective nature of the population of Burriana has conserved this place and the rest of the population of the urban speculation. It is very advisable as a zone of passage, since the police does not allow camping, park with motorhome or go for a long period of time. Example of the protective nature of its people, is the elimination of the campsite located on the sandy beach and its unique and solitary three-storey hotel."
25014,3281498,3,babaradammann,10/09/2023,"Otherwise a nice place, we were lucky and were right by the sea. It's a shame the showers are very old. They could be renewed. Only had one jet of water when showering. Price ok, everything included. 24€ per day."
25014,3213503,2,JensenPadalecki,25/08/2023,"A very basic campsite. The pool is very small and like a boiling pot, a very expensive supermarket and bar, very old bathrooms and services, garbage placed in a place that is difficult to access. Pitches of many sizes, most shaded. It faces the beach but the beach is full of stones and is very small. Music until late, lots of parties... animation all day, little quiet."

The place is quite old, but still okay for us. At the entrance to the square you have to drive over a level crossing with a larger ""hubbel"". We drove very slowly with our big one (8.20 m) and didn't touch down. ant alert"
25014,2938567,2,Dennis_Emma,08/07/2023,"In itself it is a nice place for families. However, the sanitary facilities are very outdated and not super clean. There are many families there, who are also very noisy. When we wanted to swim in the sea, we were completely cut open and had to leave the water bleeding. We then left the place without staying overnight. We're definitely not coming back."

Unfortunately, this campsite is plagued by a thieves guild, which means that burglary is the rule rather than the exception. the response to this is (too) laconic. Facilities are clean. Showers unfortunately not of this time. yet a place for us to avoid for the time being."

25014,2151741,2,grayster2,31/07/2022,"Interesting site. Not what I would call rustic. All plots have electric and there are full facilities including swimming pool. A large number of plots house very long term units, using plastic, sheds, electrical appliances, items of furniture, and other materials, so that it resembled more of a shanty town than a campsite. Incredibly busy and constant music, as well as a large number of people."

25014,2010465,4,enda_c,25/06/2022,Good spot by the beach. Very busy right now with families and other campers. Pool is good but crowded as well. Showers a little weird. Beach is nice but stoney. Entrance is a little confusing as it looks like a one-way road but drive through and park by reception and they'll open the gate for you. WiFi is pretty poor in the location. Good for one or two nights.

The price includes electricity, water and disposal, as well as the showers, everything was very clean. The huts exude a somewhat ramshackle charm. It's a shame that some ""German"" big ships believe that it is their place."
25014,1096052,5,digitaldesignnomad,17/10/2020,"Very nice place! We stood right by the sea, two meters from the sandy beach. For swimming you should go to the beach 30 meters further, because there are fewer stones in the water and no sea urchins. The sanitary facilities and the unloading station were clean and the staff quite friendly. Washing machines are available and cost four euros. We paid 15 euros / night for a mobile home, two people and a dog (second week of October), which is cheap for the location. It was just a shame that there were no shops nearby."

Knowing that the prices have been multiplied by 3 by the owner, but the services have not changed and the sanitary facilities really leave something to be desired! dishes in cold water. the noise of the train at 5.30 am ... the ants ....... the beach at the campsite you cannot swim because there is no background"

I stop there, I saw a good amount of campsites over this past year across several European countries, but there, for 19 € per night, it makes me want to cry !!!"

25017,281830,1,javeasteve5,06/07/2018,"Live near here and really surprised to see it recommended. In summer it may be okay for camper van as parking spaces are for cars and it is rammed, so much so they park on hill leading to parking. Motorhomes, would not recommend arriving until after dark. In winter different story although the steepness of some parts would still cause concern, I use 1st gear in a car. If you do take chance be warned in summer you may not be able to turn around due to cars parked both sides of road.  It is known locally as Barraca but on Google Earth as Playa del Portitxol."
25017,221860,4,2165Wilfried,07/02/2018,"Very nice place to spend the night. No service. Beware the road is very sloping to access it and to leave you need a very powerful engine because slopes to 20%. In the rain impossible to go up because the tires slip. Beware the 130 hp of my Fiat Ducato were barely enough in 1st to go up my camper to the road, so be careful."

Better for campers and small motorhomes. The grass that surrounds the parking lot, next to the path that runs parallel to the Ebro River, is full of excrement, therefore we could not open the side windows because the smell was nauseating.

Well located for visiting the area. Clean bathrooms and nice environment. We come with 3 children and between the pool and the animations they did not want to go. The only downside would be the laundry room. The regular washer cleans and the dryer needs 2 cycles.

Parking very dirty (leftover cod market ground) where people come to empty their dirt at the bottom. Noisy at night (dogs barking and factory off that rings every 20 seconds!). This is not at all the best area we are made of.
25149,205661,2,skamax33,24/10/2017,"The area is big, but very dirty and noisy during the day because of the road and the bus station nearby."

25157,2653727,5,terrystravel,09/04/2023,"Very convenient parking with a beautiful view, for lunch and visiting the city. It is not allowed to spend the night there, there is a prohibition sign."
25157,1470725,5,AlmaVanlifeCamper,17/08/2021,Quiet place but it must be taken into account that it is not possible to enter or exit between 22:00 and 10:00. Be careful with the wind because it tends to blow strong and moves the van a lot. There are no water services but nearby there are bars at a good price for breakfast or lunch.
25157,1441070,4,Henrrubi,11/08/2021,Good place to park with beautiful views of the sea. The parking lot is paved and we have not needed the shoes. Quite a few free parking spaces in the middle of August.
25157,1412360,3,JenniferPille,06/08/2021,Fantastic location but the noise from the youngsters has to be taken into account!
25157,1321850,4,usoba,13/07/2021,"The local police came around 10pm with a tow truck, we asked them directly if they could sleep and they said yes, only that they were going to close with the fences. Some kids in a car have been sent out, we understand that it will be because you can not leave or enter during the night. No problem."
25157,1230466,5,Catavantour,01/06/2021,Dream spot we slept for 3 days. But there are the young people of the city who are celebrating.
25157,1212490,1,soniaeg9,23/05/2021,Horrible! Impossible to sleep. macro bottle of groups of young people with loud music in cars making a big party and the police without showing up.
25157,1212114,1,MIC72,23/05/2021,"Fatal, what has been mounted say botellon is little. Sale of drugs, music to all host, roar of car and motorcycle engine. Police did not show up until 4 hours after it all started when there were already fights starting. He scattered them, all running and when they left a few returned to continue the party making less noise but with music. And no more patrols have happened again."

25157,693493,1,ChrisnRay,16/09/2019,"Wonderful spot to park for the night with amazing views over Roses bay. However, the local car driving youths of a certain cultural group do not want you there. We tolerated the continuous driving up and down blaring out music between 9 pm and 3.30am. We refused to be intimidated when they parked beside the van and we stayed after they left but I strongly recommend that this spot is avoided where possible. A good indication of their intent is the fact that they have painted the words ‘no campers’ on the wall and floor themselves!"
25157,678854,2,zazin,06/09/2019,Watch out for the police almond and go past and halfway through
25157,673463,4,pffiedler,02/09/2019,Really nice view from this parking. Access to the sea can be done on foot in a few minutes. Only downside for the evening because it turns a lot at the bottom of the car park with the same passages of cars. With our 2 small children we preferred to leave.
25157,639736,5,dianamartin,18/08/2019,"Parking of the ascent to the Castell de la Trinitat. Magnificent views, level ground and wc during opening hours of the castle. In high season many campers and small ac. We would have loved to stay more nights."

25157,564498,4,gambiermatthieu,20/07/2019,Actually very beautiful view of the bay. We had a meal break and it is very pleasant. Our neighbors have confirmed that for the night you have to stay on the edge of the car park because young people come late or very early (in their case 8am with music).

25157,425768,5,KittandPit,30/01/2019,We spent a few days here without any problems. The police often look over and check if everything is OK. The views of the sea and the sunrise and sunset are fantastic.
25157,398816,3,Havand,25/10/2018,"Good and quiet in the off-season. In the evening some locals in their cars, maybe for a joint or with a girlfriend. So, no problem at all."
25157,396329,3,silman85,20/10/2018,Pretty pitch with a view of the city and the sea. We were there on Friday night and during the whole night there were guys in the car with very loud music. To check if the situation is the same in the week.

25157,300901,3,viejo_barbas,25/07/2018,"A seemingly quiet place with good views, we had been warned that it is a place that cars and couples go to smoke a few ""cigarillos"" something that we do not care but we played the subnormales who played the music at full volume and shouting awakenings and joderos, We were 3 BC and some Germans ended up going, we put up with it, we just had bad luck."
25157,288200,3,celinetpv,14/07/2018,"Nice view ! But put yourself at the beginning of the parking to not be close to the locals who also come to admire the view by moped car etc ... all night long. The police passed while we were eating, she checked and a little bothered locals next to us (for half an hour) but left us alone. They are ironed at night without firing us. There are toilets that open at 17h until 22h."

And one down the water with trash cans, great views of the sea, direct hiking trail and across the street a huge parking paved with a great view of Roses. No supply and disposal. Right on the lighthouse, so very bright at night. Located on the main street, so in the high season very noisy. Many hikers and tourists on the way. Otherwise mega nice !!!"
25157,207652,3,zaina,30/10/2017,"Thanks to momsss64.On is of course this spot accessible to all vehicles. Nevertheless you need a means of locomotion other than the motorhome, it's better if you want to stay one night. Good road people."

You can go to the town by walking or cycling (on the road or the walk with care because there are pieces in which the walk is narrow and many people circulate). Approximately 5-6 motorhomes can be parked. It is just below the castle and next to the lighthouse

25165,2892751,3,jf11,25/06/2023,"Very correct campsite but I only give 3 stars because the restaurant is pathetic and unworthy of the campsite. We ate this afternoon a paella ordered 2 days ago, very bad experience, I have never eaten such a bad paella, very few toppings straight from the box, even the unpleasant rice, the price is still 19 € per person! Industrial ice cream for desert, total for 6 people with a few beers €165! A shame ! A real tourist trap, avoid this place."

Perfect for exploring the city, but the restaurant on the campsite is good too. Had the gambas this place is famous for. €6 per gamba was steep but also delicious."
25165,2734270,4,mr.benji,08/05/2023,"nice place, with a sea view a little more expensive then 31.80 including tourist tax. Otherwise from €14. not far from the old port with its restaurants and the historic center, as well as the beaches 10 minutes walk.

Hike started directly at the square to Cala de Palafrugell (unfortunately organized the way back yourself, since buses were very difficult or not possible). Beautiful days spent."

25165,2333273,5,schmidtisontour,02/09/2022,Super nice pitch! Almost all plots have sea views. Only the upper ones are recommended for WoMo! It's too narrow and steep at the bottom... the gastro is quite expensive but the view is very nice!
25165,2315752,4,bimbaraner,28/08/2022,Camping divided into two parts: the oldest with more charm and close to the sea and the coves but on the other hand smaller plots and complicated access for large ACs. Clean amenities but perhaps could use updating. The other part with larger plots and where the pool is. Overall happy with the stay. Price somewhat excessive... I suppose that the situation makes them raise the price
25165,2307812,2,Mikkko,27/08/2022,"The location is hilly, you need to plan a bike to go to the beach quickly (even if the return is all uphill ...). Large and clean services, hot water always available. The pitches, in some areas, are poorly organized and the boundaries are not understood. The most ""serious"" problem is the presence of ants! 65 euros per day for 3 with a small dog is too much, but aligned with the area."
25165,2305973,3,krys92120,26/08/2022,"super nice campsite, the campsite side where the reception is located is great for the view, we had a pitch with a sea view! cove at the bottom of the campsite, sandy beach not even 10min walk away. the showers and toilets were always clean. in the other part of the campsite there are two swimming pools, a soccer field. enough to please the children only downside the restaurant closes early, no evenings offered"
25165,2205289,2,Mricur,09/08/2022,"Very expensive campsite in high season. We found the jacks magnificent and for snorkelling these are a treat. Too bad that access to the beach is reserved for the person who has the location on the sea side and therefore not open to everyone. Otherwise nice location, shower in its own juice, clean pool but too much chlorine."
25165,2200068,2,gruissannaise,08/08/2022,"expensive camping for one night for two people, electricity and a dog. the restaurant at 9 p.m. it closes the kitchens. 9:45 p.m., they no longer serve coffee. 10 p.m. they turn off the lights on the terrace close the umbrellas. I feel like they fired you. Noisy campsite. We had no choice"

25165,2047033,4,Orion11,07/07/2022,"Very pleasant stay, nice view, location in espaliers (I was in the sea side part). Reasonable price compared to other campsites in the area. Paid 29€/day with electricity for 1 van +1 person. Possibilities of hiking along the coastal path or swimming in the various small surrounding coves. Friendly and smiling staff."
25165,1973139,5,AlessioCanepa,13/06/2022,"Huge campsite divided into three parts, with pitches ranging from € 20 to € 35 (with sea view). Great, large and shady pitches from € 20. Clean bathrooms. Electricity and water for a fee. Both the center of Palamos and the beautiful Cala Fosca beach are a 15 minute walk away."
25165,1951072,5,joke64,06/06/2022,"This campsite consists of 3 parts and associated prices, 20, 30 and 35 (with sea view) euros. Sanitary is sober and clean. Restaurant is available in the park. Cove with pebble and rocks are close by. For a deposit of 5 euros you can borrow a key to walk the short route to these bays. Sandy beach is about 10 minutes by bike. Good wifi for 5 euros for 3 days"
25165,1925691,4,Margotescargot,28/05/2022,"Pleasant campsite very close to the sea and the coastal path. The only downside, only one small swimming pool open from 10 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. in May. The pitches are very good around 16 euros with electricity for one cc and two adults."
25165,1819516,5,geraallday,13/04/2022,"We were pleasantly surprised. The place was very empty at that time, we had a pitch with a sea view. Sanitary facilities very clean. Supermarket had pre-ordered fresh baguette. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Palamos can be reached on foot in 20 minutes. A great hiking trail with hikes to beautiful bays right outside the door."
25165,1600779,4,schnickers2000,22/09/2021,"Including electricity € 18 for campers & 2 people, absolutely clean sanitary facilities. from Friday to Sunday € 3 surcharge, rather incomprehensible, as you have to reckon with more guests, full and dirtier bathrooms on the weekend and it is definitely louder. You would have to be compensated for that! The places are big, spacious, shady and you can choose the place yourself, especially in the back of the place."
25165,1317697,3,Patrushh,12/07/2021,"The camping was not bad. The large plots the only thing that the light sockets if you do not have a reel, it will be very difficult to plug in because they are quite far away. And the bathrooms ... leave a lot to be desired. The showers full of mosquitoes and ants. There is a 10 or 15 minute walk to the beach because the one that the campsite says that you have direct access is not a beach."
25165,1308354,5,bili3,09/07/2021,Delighted with the camping. We prefer the most remote area where the access to the beach is not very close but we have a very quiet pool next to it. Very large pitches and some with a lot of shade (others in the sun). Spotless bathrooms and showers. Supermarket to get out of trouble at the campsite. Perfect location to start part of the Camí de Ronda route from here.
25165,1224338,5,idairamiraga,29/05/2021,"Camping quality / price very well. At least on these dates they are not overcrowded. The departure is at 2:00 p.m. and they have left us quietly until 4:30 p.m. that we have since it was not full. The Pisces closed, only the Jacuzzi open, but it fills up with all the children and parents. The coves a few minutes away, but it is not worth the € 5 deposit to go down (x if you lose it) since it can be accessed perfectly from the outside. The toilets and showers were pretty clean, at least these days. It cost us € 17 for two people and the camper, we have chosen the cheapest part of plots since it is much better to access with caravans and campers, and because the other, although it is more expensive due to the views that overlook the beach, only You have them in the plots that are on the edge, the rest are much smaller and without views. There is a bar and a supermarket. Friendly staff."

25165,996723,5,MAKIMTHY,23/08/2020,Quiet campsite and clean site with sea view. Access to a private cove. Large swimming pool in another part of the campsite.
25165,862924,3,Bibijc,12/07/2020,"Nice view of the pink part on the sea side but if you stay for several days and you want to empty the gray water or fill up with water, you will have to move your CC to go to the other part of the campsite and maneuver to be planned. The dedicated CC locations will certainly be more accessible for large CCs. Clean sanitary facilities, rather quiet if you don't consider the animals."
25165,837177,4,danpir81,26/06/2020,"Clean, shaded and quiet campsite at this period, out of town and from the beach except by bike we stayed 2 days 56 € for 2 without electricity"
25165,820753,4,Reicheling,10/06/2020,"A quiet campsite, perhaps still due to the situation of the covid. Some comments state that the photos do not correspond. But they are from the campsite since it is divided into two, an older part and a newer part. Perhaps the prices could be improved. For access to the beach they give a key with a deposit of € 5 to return. Clean services and friendly staff."
25165,671067,3,Didiruca06,01/09/2019,"Camping Palamos, Large plots with shadow and full of ants. 2 pools, although one is held on September 1, the other one did not like green water. Incivica and poorly educated people, awful showers. There are campsites with fewer stars that are much better than this."
25165,557490,2,AntonioMG,16/07/2019,"We spent two nights on our route along the Costa Brava. We chose it for the good opinions in this application and because it is 1st category (apparently). We choose badly where to place ourselves in the multitude of places: uncivil people, noise from the road, plagued by ants, some cat spinning around to eat ... And regarding the cleanliness of the bathrooms and showers, I do not think so. There is a small supermarket and a couple of coves that can be accessed with a key that you get at reception. With regard to the price, I personally see it expensive for what they offer even considering that it is a holiday period."
25165,523104,4,jf11,21/06/2019,"Very good campsite for me, 16,50 € right now! What more ? Near the calas and a nice walk on the walkway. If you have an electric bike, I recommend you take the bike path to Callela de Palafrugel, this resort is really beautiful!"
25165,368822,4,Moewe,09/09/2018,"Quiet, small campsite in close proximity to the sea. The rocky beach is great for snorkeling and relaxing. Sanitary facilities clean, hot water available at all times. Annoying, however, were the pigeons, who like to set up their camp in the trees of the CP and vollkacken the Womos. Probably not all plots are affected."
25165,362632,5,jormer,02/09/2018,"The camping is Palamós and the photos are not corresponding, very large plots, with swimming pools, barbecues, correct bathrooms and the perfect staff. The price € 12 low season, cheaper than the area and with many more services."
25165,331399,5,CarlosM,13/08/2018,"The photographs are not from the Palamos campsite, the location itself. I already warned the administrators of the page of the mistake, but the change was not made. Camping Palamos excellent camping."

25165,328992,1,pessoa1969,12/08/2018,They ask us 50 eu. For using what until recently was a motorhome area within the campsite. And they tell us that in the low season they will be 25 eu. By night shame. in less than a year it has risen almost 100%.

25165,242180,2,freddy31,28/04/2018,"We have just spent one night, and for us it will be the only one because the noise of the nearby road is unbearable. It is true that the location offers an extra view but I think that in the second part of the campsite it must be less noisy.

For 17 € days, because they have the sense of the trade (the area of ​​the motorhomes with 12 € is with 300 m) we could take advantage of the swimming pool (50 m) and all the equipments such as the toilets, trade , emptying and filling water. The beach of Fosca (that of the city) is 10 minutes (dog not allowed) and that of Castell where dogs are accepted 35 minutes. Outside these beaches, it is a rocky coast with a walkway overlooking magnificent views."

Very good price services."
25165,75147,4,CHICOU,30/05/2016,"I went with my camper, it cost me $ 8 a night, and the location was very good. What to avoid with a motorhome is to go on the party next to the reception. The other part is very well adapted for motorhomes and we have easy access to the services of the campsite (toilets, showers ...). Possible access to a water pipe (1 € for 10 minutes). On the other hand, it is a little out of the city, the beach is dangerous and impractical. After in the city, and towards San Antoni there are many places and car parks where you can park. After it is true that for 8 € it's very good, and you can have all the services of the campsite."

Some security guys approached us to tell us that we should put the caravan on battery but talking with them they reasoned that it would be better as we had it, it was the first day of vacation and we put our motorhome looking at the sea we started in luxury !!"
25175,988721,5,warsdesign,21/08/2020,Unfortunately monitored by GNR and nature protection local authorities. We were told that it was forbidden to spend the night.

25175,752699,2,Ayesha,11/12/2019,Smelly place. Destroyed BBQ. It's such a shame people treat nature this way. On the plus side it is by the beach and in low season you're likely to be on your own. The road to it is dirt and a bit bumpy but not too bad.
25175,689132,3,Michel2272,13/09/2019,Place has a lot of flies because people shit and pis in the area. Bring a bucket or toilet and empty it the special place at intermarche sines. More and more places are already shutting down or are forbidden to stay at night because of this. Van life will end to exist like this in Europe if you people keep doing this.

Immense beach, natural area and dunes all around. The road to get is a bit bumpy but worth it. If you like nature is the right place! GNR passes once a day, they are friendly and helpful. The ocean, the beach, the sunsets and your camper, you do not need anything else!"

Otherwise you stand like in a garden with lots of trees. SAT reception was possible. The pool was clean and big enough for a swim. We paid €24 for 2 people with electricity. A little overpriced.

25203,3130240,4,sunlightdelight,12/08/2023,Been in March and then very quiet. Almost deserted area. Great place to sleep and the campsite has a kind of bar restaurant. Will be crazy in the summer. I think. Unfortunately it is not possible to use more. This is nature reserve. Beach is a little further but public
25203,3124687,4,LaRamonettadeBlan,11/08/2023,The facilities are old but it is a quiet place and the views of the lake are beautiful. the beach is about 15 minutes away and is beautiful. In the lake there were many flamingos. In the restaurant it is simple and you need to be patient... but the food is good. at night there are mosquitoes where there is light but they do not bite much.
25203,3121051,1,Sabdav13,11/08/2023,"Total disappointment. Unpleasant welcome, we were not given a plan to locate ourselves and locate our location. Dilapidated toilets. Electricity jumping constantly. 30 euros a night for that! Inadmissible. Just nice view of the lagoon."

Too bad we didn't sleep all night because sewage water with a nauseating smell came out of a drain. The campsite didn't fix it urgently and denied us a discount for the hellish night (the minimum!). Misunderstanding can happen, but it's dishonest to charge for such a service"

25203,2872180,5,Chaso3,19/06/2023,Friendly welcome. Free placement under the pines. Cheap. Campsite and clean toilets. Great for 1 or 2 nights. Quiet apart from the dogs in the distance barking all night but waking up with a view of the flamingos :)
25203,2863993,2,JPeterH,17/06/2023,"Large place, any choice, many trees highly recommended. Relatively flat. View of the bay. Disadvantages: Current Max 2 Ah so worthless, included in the price cannot be deselected. No washing machines available, place is fenced off with barbed wire. Possibly because of a nature reserve. Swimming not possible! Otherwise a bit dated and worn. But not for a few more days."

25203,2827587,3,veedeepee,07/06/2023,It has what a campsite should have. Through the large fence around it (which we think can fit a door). Can't you go to the adjacent water. Half of the campsite is fully built for regular guests.

You have free choice of place which gave us a super nice shady spot. The beach and the beach bar are fantastic and can be reached on foot in just 12-15 minutes, but the stay is definitely worth it to enjoy the sunset on the beach!"

25310,1149267,4,jugrillo,09/03/2021,"An area with gray and black water services is unpaved, you can park and spend the night and there is shade from trees we do not spend the night but it seems a quiet area, it is on the outskirts of town but there is a polygon next to it, there is to visit some mines and today you have to make an appointment."
25310,1145262,2,goribf6,02/03/2021,"As a positive point is that you are practically in the field and as a negative that the cleaning tap does not allow you to fill water with the hose, and it is from the push-button taps."
25310,1119969,4,luifer,07/12/2020,"We have been alone but we were comfortable, the tap to fill the water does not have a lever. You can also spend the night in the mine that has good parking"
25310,1118544,2,blor,30/11/2020,Excessively narrow with an earthy soil that gets muddy when it rains. Perhaps it should have a paved entrance and exit service area.
25310,1085832,4,fran_free,08/10/2020,Essential area in the Villuercas (there is only one more in Deleitosa and without emptying or filling) shadows and quiet town. Great for the town. Without eleectricity.
25310,1017006,3,bouyoco,31/08/2020,A place with a free water change in this area is appreciated. It is a bit narrow but can be used. Somewhat complicated parking for large motorhomes due to the presence of trees. I spent a quiet night.
25310,977218,4,jesus_asturias,18/08/2020,"Near the road, without having to deviate almost anything, an area with trees and fields. It has gray and black water to fill and empty. I have not stayed overnight."
25310,794676,5,JORDI2EURA,12/03/2020,"The place is full of grass and it is a bit difficult to see which is the best place to park but there is good water and all amenities are working well. Most important is a visit to the old phosphorite mine, guided by very friendly staff, who goes through the old galleries. If you want to make this visit you can also park and spend the night in the parking of the interpretation center, well lit."
25310,759972,2,laspescadillasviajeras,30/12/2019,Gray and black empty canine to Guadalupe and fill the water tanks. We also take the opportunity to eat. Bravo for the initiative to the town hall and their neighbors would like to have that detail with our tourism
25310,476551,2,pusyneta,05/05/2019,"For emptying gray, black and water recharge fulfills its function."
25310,448116,2,rafaydana,02/04/2019,"Although it fulfills its function (with skill and care we have managed to fill water and empty gray and black), the area is poorly designed (narrow and small) and in a muddy area that is very difficult to square to enter it. Despite this we have been able to use it for what we thank. We want you to fix it and fulfill its function"
25310,435785,1,wina5859,03/03/2019,Not suitable to stay
25310,411037,3,Toyotomi,30/11/2018,"It is to be appreciated the existence of the area, among other things it is free and it is good to empty and recharge when you go en route through the area. The problem is that it is in a muddy area, and the platform is too narrow to access if you can not do it in front (for mud and water). At least provides service, if the next area was well equipped sure would be a point of interest for motorhomes that travel through the Geopark Villuercas-Ibores."
25310,334946,2,SunRoller,15/08/2018,"It is always appreciated the fact of having a site with services, but when we were not convinced the place. The ground is dirt and bumpy on the ground, and it was also completely solitary. The best is the visit to the mine of the Costanaza which is 500 meters away. The visit was very pleasant and enjoyable, thanks to the guide Pedro."
25310,279798,3,willvy,03/07/2018,"The area is a place where they herd a flock of sheep. Where I parked there was no moñiga. The place is very quiet and you can see that they want to improve it because there are canalizations made. The best thing is that at 500 meters there is the interpretation center of the fossil mine ""Costanaza"" that is worth visiting, lasts about 2 hours and is very interesting. Do not hesitate to go, it's worth it."
25310,249019,1,gilles1310,08/05/2018,"Weird, dirty area, the ground clearance and the overhang of my motorhome were incompatible with access. Path smashed and pebbles salient. Moreover, it did not inspire us. We went up to La Estrella."
25310,245055,5,CapitanClick,02/05/2018,"BEST IMPOSSIBLE HEAR! Clean, operational and with a green space with shade to spend the afternoon and night. A little from the town walking and a very quiet place. So much so that at 4am to about 500mtrs they put the music to the top in a car and a storm stopped that returned the kids home. Great if you're on the road. The town is not expensive and has some mines to visit."
25310,230761,4,sevorane,29/03/2018,"Grass area, with many trees. It has to empty black and gray water and fill water. The town is less than five minutes walk away, and is very well located posts or walking to see the mine of Logrosan. No problems to spend the night, very quiet area."
25310,139870,4,cabocop,01/06/2017,Good shadow There was a lot of large animal excrement. We were alone and very calm.
25310,101283,3,sabedra,29/08/2016,"The area is located at the exit of the village just after the roundabout, right, direction Cañamero, restaurant nearby, the last two photos are news, taken on August 28, 2016, typical village, nearby you can visit the Constanza mines of the nineteenth century and the museum (very interesting visit)."
25310,54010,1,papounou,06/09/2015,"We stayed there on 6/09/15 and the area has nothing to do with the pictures. It is a rather gloomy place in the middle of a disused area. But as there is not much in the corner, we will be satisfied."
25310,44276,5,Batalayus,27/07/2015,Very quiet area and well located in the Guadalupe region.
25313,3214824,4,Cyrille85200,25/08/2023,Very good parking place. I recommend the os castrejos restaurant. Very good traditional dish.
25313,3170780,3,bgaraialde,18/08/2023,Sand parking located next to the Eiffel bridge and close to the city on foot. Parking is shared with cars and parking spaces are not delimited. This produces chaos that can result in difficulties getting out of the car park. There are no services of any kind. A bit noisy at night due to parties. Free and you can stay overnight
25313,3121460,1,edwige56,11/08/2023,Could have been good for parking but like everyone else it's parked no matter how you get stuck!! Forced to reverse in reverse!! Do not go there you will be blocked see last photo

25313,2711272,2,dragonqueen,30/04/2023,"Good, central, quiet place without service with a good view of the Eiffel Bridge and Rio Lima. Unfortunately, the cable car to the Santuário de Santa Luzia is not in operation at the moment. If the ascent is too strenuous for you, you can drive up with the mobile home and park for a short time at the top. It's worth a visit."
25313,2694702,4,surfjah99,24/04/2023,"common parking but a nice view of the bridge. a lot of parking spots. there were only two more with us. few minutes from the center, really good option to visit."

25313,2619969,3,spoony03,22/03/2023,Large car park with plenty of spaces and quite close to the center. there are also many holes that have filled with rainwater making parking difficult. we stayed there for a few hours to visit and buy Berlin Bolos at Natario.
25313,2540917,3,chantaldante,04/01/2023,Large dented car park without services but too close to the bridge and the railway and close to the marina where you can take a nice walk. We spent a night a little restless given the noise.
25313,2509526,1,egoman,30/11/2022,The course consists of huge water holes. I kept going!
25313,2477741,3,HotelRodinhas,01/11/2022,Easy to get there. Sleeping is not comfortable. It is next to the highway and very close to the train. A pity that Viana does not enable a space for AC.
25313,2334151,3,LosCano,03/09/2022,We left the AC to go for a walk around the city but we didn't spend the night. Close to the center and a very pleasant walk once you pass the bridge. It gives a little bad feeling but we had no problems.
25313,2332833,5,PR46,02/09/2022,Excellent park to stay overnight and take a walk through the city.
25313,2224031,5,aureliav,12/08/2022,"We only parked there to visit the city. We arrived at 2:00 p.m., the place was quite full, but we still got a place. Many other mobile homes."
25313,2214611,2,30051962,11/08/2022,Convenient for taking a break and visiting the city. Large car park next to the Eiffel bridge. But the place remains noisy from passing cars and the train. Bring caps for the night.

25313,1940922,4,CHUSDA,02/06/2022,"Central location, no services. As the browser gives confusing data and to avoid entering a loop, once you reach the water you must follow “local transit” and in 10 meters another sign indicates “tourist car” and in another 10 meters you can see the esplanade on the right to park. SEE PHOTOS OF THE POSTERS"
25313,1936627,5,Luka40CC,01/06/2022,"Big place, lots of deep puddles when it rains. Close to town with river and harbor views. no service"

25313,1697878,5,Norfri,25/11/2021,"This is the second time I've been here, dirt floor but flat. Several AC to stay overnight here. Sometimes the train passes and makes noise. It is 1 km from the historic centre."
25313,1672787,4,Quicolas,01/11/2021,Wide central and flat. Puddles in winter because it is dirt. Very practical with everything one step away. Cool
25313,1638935,2,Lndngo,11/10/2021,"Plenty of space for parking, right on the water. Since it is next to a bridge where not only cars drive over it, but also trains, it is quite loud. In the morning the parking lot fills up so there are a lot of people there. The advantage of this parking lot is that there is a skate park right next to it. Now comes the highlight: 3 minutes from the parking lot is a pizzeria called ""beira rio"" there is free WiFi."
25313,983561,2,lbokel,20/08/2020,Quite loud. The train cannot be ignored.

25313,525069,2,Dwarfland,22/06/2019,"We arrived on a Saturday and at first it seemed fine. Lots of space alongside the river, easy walk to town. However, in early evening a group of youths in cars arrived and began racing round the car park. Highly dangerous- handbrake turns, wheelspins, churning clouds of dust, being cheered on by their friends. We saw the occupants of a number of motorhomes examining their paintwork and windscreens- it looked like they’d been chipped by gravel. The driving was so dangerous we were worried about a collision so decided to leave at 7pm. Avoid on a weekend !"
25313,523882,4,Cayvse,21/06/2019,Parking is easy to find and very central. Nice view of the water and the bridge. We spent one night here.

25313,423095,3,Sarumr,17/01/2019,"Some noise from the cars passing by the bridge, especially the train, but we slept well. Good location, you have a walk next to the center and 5 minutes walk. It is very close to the elevator to the monastery of Santa Luzia, recommended 100%, has incredible views. We were 4 caravans and our van."

25323,3129697,4,msanfol,12/08/2023,A great place to spend the night and in front of the beach. I give it 4 stars because it was the only place during our trip where a camper was playing music and talking loudly outside the camper until the wee hours. It has a beach bar nearby so I guess it calls for the party.

Perfect for vans and small motorhomes. You have to park in battle so it's fair if you have a large motorhome. Gorgeous beach! Protected site with pretty preserved dunes. Thank you for respecting this place :)
25323,2197689,5,Minotavrvs,08/08/2022,"Surroundings of 10. Huge beach, with clean waters and estuary. Wide picnic area. Faucets and showers. Few parking spaces for large ACs since they protrude from the car park except in some places. If people park well, there would be more parking spaces. Ideal to do the Fuciño do Porco route (prior reservation is needed) since you can only park ACs in the first parking lot (and it's disgusting). Quiet."

In the beach bar, you can eat great, very good products, and the owner and the rest of the staff are always very pleasant. The beautiful beach and great to go with children. For vehicles over 6 meters I do not see it. you stand out for sure because it's on drums."
25323,1892352,5,Sandris22,15/05/2022,"The place is beautiful, right in front of the beach (with showers) we spent a very quiet night with other vans, the streetlights do not go out at night, the restaurant does not open until 12. Highly recommended."
25323,1677197,5,vanandapram,04/11/2021,Although next to the road it is very quiet this time of year. Just us and a few die hard swimmers during the day. Restaurant closed now fir the season. Great walk up the hill and out to the point. I would say parking would be difficult in the summer months but great now in October / November
25323,1583587,5,silvia_23,16/09/2021,Really cool beach - perfect for surfers!

25323,1515614,4,ega_85,26/08/2021,"A good place to enjoy a picnic with a beach bar, tables, toilets and showers. In summer it is better to go late in the afternoon to park, when people are leaving the beach."
25323,1508809,5,izarrago,24/08/2021,"Very good site, quiet and safe, many people camp without becoming saturated. It has bathrooms, and a beach bar next to it (it's nothing to write home about but it gets you out of a hurry). The only but is that there are streetlights on throughout the night, otherwise great"

25323,1357671,4,javivi67,24/07/2021,Quiet and ideal area to do the Fociño do Porco route. I pass the civil guard and no inconvenience. You have to be very careful when entering and leaving because the road is narrow.Blue flag beach.
25323,1355155,3,ndavila,23/07/2021,"Battery parking, not suitable Ac of more than 6m, without services. Picnic area in front and perfect to go to the beach, and Monte do Fuciño. If you park next to the beach bar there will be noise until 12-1 in the morning, then a quiet night. To get in and out better first or last hour, then complicated with the cars that go to the beach, the road is not very wide."
25323,1312803,2,CalliCamper,11/07/2021,"The food in the restaurant is really very good. But it wasn't a quiet night. Car traffic, music, conversations the whole (!) Night. The atmosphere was never frightening, but sleep was still out of the question. Maybe it's quieter a little further out, but near the restaurant / kiosk I don't recommend standing at night, especially with kids."
25323,1255621,5,nuskag,14/06/2021,"Parking a step away from the beach, with picnic areas. Quiet area at this time (mid-June). It is a battery parking, so very large ACs will not be able to park, since they protrude towards the road."
25323,1248013,5,brasjorge,11/06/2021,"Superb beach with the small flowing river. Very good restaurant with toilets. There is also water with beach showers but the public toilets are closed, we were told at the restaurant that they open in July. It's pretty quiet here."
25323,1151701,5,Christian1991,14/03/2021,"We slept from Saturday to Sunday. Since it was winter and with the perimeter closure of Galicia we parked horizontally. In summer if you go in Ac of more than 6.5 m it can be difficult to park in battery that is how the parking is distributed. Very quiet, no noise. Perfect location for surfers and lovers of walking routes"
25323,1147831,5,losperrilos242,06/03/2021,"Quiet place, ideal for walking to the “Cova da Doncela” and the “Fuciño do Porco” route. We stayed one night."

25323,993700,5,Setecentos,23/08/2020,"We slept on several occasions, always quiet but more crowded in summer and on weekends. Pine forest, toilets, fountain, showers on the beach, picnic tables, a beach bar ... Great place. There are longer and shorter parking spaces, for large AC you have to pay attention to those where the wall is further back or the road is invaded when parking."

25323,732260,2,nacotoy,28/10/2019,"Nice location actually, especially in season. We left because a car came to be placed at about ten meters, while there are 200 m of stabilized locations and materialized, the individual driving our back to us, but always to turn to observe us. We preferred to leave the place and position ourselves a few km"
25323,670711,5,Suso72,31/08/2019,"Very good place to spend the night. The beach is nearby and is very good, it is worth not letting us be with our pets, only in the early morning and at night. Large motorhomes stand out a bit, but somewhere else they fit in well. 100% recommended"
25323,663287,3,ripi,27/08/2019,For large motorhomes there is little room they stand out a lot. Better talk to the restaurant and park inside your parking lot. from there you can walk the route of the fuciño do porco. A walk at the edge of the sea by walkways quite entertaining and without difficulty.
25323,642441,5,lolivan,19/08/2019,"Spectacular everything. A site 10, we did not want to leave, we spent the night on August 19, 2019. Super quiet, clean bathrooms, beach bar, Olaya Preciosa, leveled .. has it all."

25323,263333,4,stuartandsandra,03/06/2018,"Ps we are  9m long, twin tag, some of the bays have no wall at the back so we were able to reverse in and overhang, can’t believe we are the only ones here. I only gave 4 stars because there is no purpose built waste for the toilet cassette.  But as I said it is wonderful. Beach, trees, boarded walk ways, restaurant,"
25323,263326,4,stuartandsandra,03/06/2018,"Amazing, beach, trees, dogs allowed on the beach before 10.00am and after 9.00pm May-September, just need to read the signs. Had a nice meal and a good bottle of wine, pushed the boat out 50euros and had their fish special, could have spent much less."
25323,224955,5,mistert,27/02/2018,"Site highly recommended. We have spent the weekend there and at night, although a car passes, it is very quiet during these dates. The beach is very beautiful, and as they say there is a picnic area. The only downside is that in summer you can not go with a dog to the beach, only from 9 o'clock at night. Out of season you can go at any time without any problem."
25323,200613,5,rvanvugt,06/10/2017,"Lovely place, very quiet during the night and good acces to the beach, perfect. Just the roads to this place are a bit tricky: steep and partially very narrow. My campervan is 7,5m long and has 4,5t, I was happy that I just managed to get there and lucky to find a beautiful spot for one night. The parkings are too short for my van, but as there were no other vans, I could use 3 places. Showers are great for filling up some water and clean your feet after the early morning beachwalk... lovely!"

We managed to pass between all that was lying around, mower, pipes, games, chairs... we were tired so stayed but when I saw the showers I really regretted it.

We change plots and it's better but here there is no calm, it's 1 in the morning and they don't let us rest. The showers are great but the toilets smell terrible, they tell us the river is here Just when we go, we're sorry to say that there are rats… in short, for one day it's okay, but no more."

25558,434672,4,alisonkingy,28/02/2019,Castro Verde is a pretty town and well kept. The Basilica is worth a visit and the tiled interior repays a close inspection. The campsite is well kept with good facilities in a quiet area. There are sloping areas and further downhill there are level places. The receptionist was incredibly informative and helpful. There is an Intermarche with laundromat just before the turning from the main road entering from the north west.

Without shadow. On the beach there is a shower that (we believe) does not close at night. There are also bathrooms, we don't know if they close. Emptying and filling of waters available. Not bad for spending the night."
25562,3170937,4,mdjpinto,18/08/2023,Nice quiet area. Good system to collect gray and black waters. Good pressure on Clean water makes fast filling up. The only downside is it is a bit dusty due to be located next to a dirt road.

Water and drains ok. The shower is at the end of the beach, external with cold water. It's not ideal in the evening because it's 100m from the parking lot and there's always a strong wind."

From 10 p.m. everything is quiet, thank you ! :) finally a beach where dogs are forbidden, even in the off-season. Please stick to it! it would also be nice if you didn't take up three potential parking spaces with your camping furniture. At the back, people stand 10cm apart and the front is blocked."

25562,2784927,4,Reiziger14,25/05/2023,"A quiet place to stand for a night. The toilets are closed at the moment. You do not have a sea view from the camper, you are standing on the river, behind it are the dunes and the sea. Via the jetty you walk to a village (I didn't do it myself, but it is possible). At 19:00 the baker comes. There is a stray cat that is happy if you give fresh water. When parking, take each other into account, make room."

25562,2744577,5,Wildapple,12/05/2023,"Super pitch just a few steps from the beach and sea. Supply and disposal without problems. It was very little during the day and night, but we didn't notice much of it. Perfect for a walk along the beach to let the wind blow in your face and enjoy the peace and quiet. Around 7:00 p.m. the baker drove by. We stood with about 12 other campers."
25562,2742467,5,Alt-Family,11/05/2023,"lovely place for a 15 camper. Just today, signs were put up forbidding campers to park outside the designated fence."
25562,2740742,5,schnabelewopski,11/05/2023,"A place that is rarely found in Portugal. Free, right by the sea. We got the last free parking space, but four campers were easily parked in the large car park next door."
25562,2726492,3,Floetenkoenich,05/05/2023,Arriving here just before sunset on a Friday in early May is quite sobering. The place was completely blocked. An uncomfortable place with no atmosphere. I didn't stay

25562,2716099,5,Biuchyftv,02/05/2023,"We spent a very quiet night, the place is in a privileged situation. Views of the beach and a dream sunset. Taking into account that we are in May, it must be emphasized that we only found one or two free places and we believe that they had just come out and we were ""lucky"". It makes us think that the place may be full and that there are campers who spend a long time without moving."
25562,2713787,4,OLC,01/05/2023,"Great spot to spend the night and wake up by the sea. The site was full when we arrived but we camped in the parking lot. The toilets were closed and clearly in high season it would be difficult to take dogs on the beach. But for us, it was a perfect one night stop!"
25562,2698803,4,chregu83,26/04/2023,Right on a lagoon. Parking space was full but there is a large parking lot next to it (almost better). V/E available. Beachbar was open in April. Dogs barking like everywhere.
25562,2692100,4,Gellis,23/04/2023,"Super nice place! However: Many campers with dogs, some of whom simply open the door and let the animals out so that they can run around freely and go everywhere. Among other things, we saw 2 dogs barking alone in the vehicle for hours. Sandy/muddy ground which may present an obstacle in the rain. Small kiosk with toilets and cold beach shower available"
25562,2691255,4,Charlie0604,23/04/2023,"A beautiful place by the sea where you can walk for hours. Dogs are not really allowed, but there were several on the road. Baker comes in the evening. Supply and disposal good. Only gives a deduction because a dog in the neighborhood barks all the time at night, which is annoying. Although I am a dog owner myself. Too bad, poor animal must stay outside at night, doesn't seem to like it either."
25562,2688784,5,louiseandfrank,22/04/2023,"great place for longer visits, it's quite and at the beach, fun surf spot. as well there is a stray cat ( we can't him BB king) he is super gentle so loves pets. please take good care of him."
25562,2670783,4,jo1986,14/04/2023,"perfect, beautiful place, space and free services! the bread and pastries sold by the street vendor are super good! too bad there is not a mini mercado or other nearby for shopping, it would have been more than perfect!"
25562,2664007,5,silvio135,12/04/2023,"A very nice free place right by the sea, we spent two very quiet nights here. It can get a little windy at times. The kiosk is open again and on request you will receive the key to the toilet. In 20 minutes you can walk over the jetty to the neighboring village with a restaurant."
25562,2647974,4,txampe,07/04/2023,"Perfect place, on the beach in the ria-marismas area, spectacular views. free water and waste of gray and black, a bar and beach bar. place for about 12 motorhomes but there are people who camp and save the sites, overcrowding because of these and little room for itinerants in this case there is car parking next to the night. beach baths in season and cold shower"
25562,2641374,5,ali_mit_a,05/04/2023,"A great place of this small community! Thank you very much! We spent a wonderfully quiet night (apart from the raging sea, which of course you have to like). You stand right on the river and look at the dunes, as close to nature as possible and all legally. A big highlight of our trip in Portugal, where standing freely is only possible to a very limited extent. Recommendation!"

Quiet little village, long sandy beach, great view. Supply and disposal. Everything is free. 50 m to the beach. It doesn't get any better than that."
25562,2596452,4,camperjac,02/03/2023,"beautiful, what a coast to walk along and then the sunset. water and drainage okay, garbage cans available. just a pity sand surface, if it rains you should not stand here chance that you get stuck in soft ground."
25562,2595169,5,Womo-Cacher,01/03/2023,A wonderful place with V/E and a direct view of nature. Wonderful as a starting point for hikes or bike tours. We spent a quiet night there and would love to come back.

25562,2591704,5,markusundandrea,26/02/2023,"A really nice place where you can stay for 3-4 days. Very quiet and with a beautiful beach. When it rains heavily it gets muddy, but the sun also dries up quickly. We have felt very comfortable here."
25562,2588372,3,ElVeterano,23/02/2023,"Great spot for a night or 2, but a little windy in February when we were there. We took the last place but another camper parked up in the parking by the river later with no problem. All services working. Fantastic sunset and great beach."

it is a  great motorhome stop, beautiful location and very quiet."
25562,2559719,4,javeasteve5,24/01/2023,"Spent one night in car park, aire churned up with deep ruts in middle. Quiet, relaxed as no commerce open. Two MH’s had dogs which ran around on grass river bank. Services working, some lighting and only sound was waves breaking."

25562,2505618,5,jellybeanneen,26/11/2022,"Beautiful spot, very quiet and lovely beach. It is sandy so with heavy rain it could be an issue for heavy vans. We had no issues though, free services all working. Stayed 2 nights."
25562,2499286,4,Kikitravels,18/11/2022,Lovely location however we did visit on a day where it was constantly raining so the ground was a bit messy. You can walk along the beach/boardwalk and services are available for free. I’m sure it would be much nicer on a sunny day. It was fairly quiet overnight.

25562,2489930,5,RV1988,10/11/2022,"super good place, near the beach. stayed here for 3 nights. think the toilets are only open in summer when the beach is busier. otherwise the shower is a cold one, near beach. if it rains it can get a bit muddy, but you have all the camper facilities and it's free"

Attention: if you use GPS guidance to get here chose the longer path with better “normal” road; the short path proposed by the GPS takes you through narrow roads, definitely not good for longer or wider motorhomes."
25562,2422873,5,platoon64,04/10/2022,Very nice place but a lot of people at this time. Free and no water to drain. Quiet brief I recommend.

The beach is beautiful, and very close, it has a cold shower and toilet. But don't go on Sundays, as you might not get a spot anywhere. Really crowded and the small vehicles are circulating from one side to the other looking for a place to stop."

However, there was sooooo much going on here on Sundays that we had to drive on. He also didn't promise us because it's in the last corner and there's a lot of rubbish. Inviting is different...but the beach was very clean and the water was clear and beautiful. So for a stopover completely ok"
25562,2033748,5,MartaeGianchi,03/07/2022,"The parking area dedicated to campers is not very large, but it is very convenient because it has unloading and loading right next to it.

25562,1941420,4,Migou,03/06/2022,paradise for those who love the beach sun and surf very beautiful panorama beware of the very very big waves at the edge
25562,1921580,4,kimberlysaddei,27/05/2022,"It still remains a parking lot and not a campsite folks!! And if other campers come, you can retract your awning. A bit of respect... Exactly because of you, so many campers don't like it. Otherwise the place would be nice but beware sometimes motorbikes or cars drive too fast here."
25562,1901422,5,BaerchenUrmel,19/05/2022,"A beautiful free space directly behind the dune, the beach is just 100 meters away. Gray water disposal has been released again since today. There should be more of these places, thank you."
25562,1898549,5,macglove,18/05/2022,The grey water dump can’t be used currently due to repairs of the pavement. Black and fresh water is fine. Can someone please make a note for others when grey water is restored? Thanks to the locals for being able to stay overnight at this beautiful place (beyond the service station) (:
25562,1897420,4,chachaaure,18/05/2022,Super free spot with all services (except electricity). We arrived there around 5pm and took the last spot but there is a parking lot right next to it which was almost empty. The beach is beautiful but woken up at 3am by motorcycle skids and screaming.

25562,1894086,4,Bastix,16/05/2022,"Beautiful place. Perfect to stay a couple of quiet nights with good sleep.

Only some super SELFISH campers from Netherlands behave like the king of the world and occupied more than one slot by seating there!! They didn't have any intention to give us the place when we arrived even its full. Shame on them!!!

Fortunately, thanks to a French couple who moved their car aside to give us a spot."
25562,1888069,4,HotelBravo,13/05/2022,"Very nice beach and the place to park is ok. However, if only larger caravans are here, I would estimate the pitch to be a maximum of 12. I don't have space there either with my car, but as an exception I was able to park next door. Toilets are still closed."
25562,1851898,4,sun1,25/04/2022,A great place to stay a night or so next to a big beach no problems.
25562,1845923,4,FaxePoessl,22/04/2022,The place is perfectly fine for one night. A little off the road but still plenty going on.
25562,1810610,4,cassandraboeuf,08/04/2022,"Small car park by the sea with clean water and the possibility of emptying waste water. Toilets closed during this period. Beach shower only, no hot water. Very quiet, very clean, perfect for spending the night (can be windy)"
25562,1808324,5,biquet5155,06/04/2022,"A magnificent site. Rustic but functional area. Water and drains ok. Calm and at night lulled by the sound of the ocean. Unfortunately in March, a lot of rain and wind. Beautiful walks to do. Boulanger comes by every evening at 7 p.m. and we hear him. Thank you to this municipality."
25562,1807731,5,AMR86,05/04/2022,"Nice place, but only for people who are looking for relaxation. Baker drives past the car park honking his horn and when you stand outside you can buy bread from your car."
25562,1806216,4,hdavis248,04/04/2022,"Unfortunately the area was full (not actually full but big motorhomes taking up the space of 2 or 3). Instead we parked along the front of the beach parking area. Really good baker's van at 7pm. Loss of 1 star just because the grey water was overflowing and the water tap was a push button one (don't forget to turn the main stopcock on, to the left of the emptying facilities to work the taps!)"
25562,1795225,3,camlrs,25/03/2022,No adapter to take drinking water from the tap... shame otherwise nice free parking near the beach with river flowing into the sea. It must be crowded in summer
25562,1793450,5,Gilles1383,24/03/2022,"Spot on the sea and very pleasant area, absolute rest lulled by the sound of the waves, services ok, great in the off season. Thank you for welcoming us to this beautiful place."

25562,1785995,4,shellt69,17/03/2022,"Nice place to stay by the beach but pretty busy in March. 
Baker at 7pm was very useful! Public toilets and beach bar all closed up unfortunately.
Facilities very basic and you need to open the 'agua' box to flick the isolation switch to the left to get the taps to work but easy enough. 
Would recommend for a quiet night."
25562,1781045,5,Leoniemichelle,12/03/2022,The baker comes punctually at 7:00 p.m. We spent a very quiet night here and felt very comfortable. You can go for a nice run.
25562,1779774,4,TinaWrighty,11/03/2022,"Nice pitch with access to the sea. Unfortunately, we missed the baker who came by around 7 p.m. Watch out for the funny horn! :-)"
25562,1776168,4,Lumpitz,07/03/2022,"Now something about the water topic. there is a main tap to the left of the water point in the masonry (red lever). You have turned off the main tap because a tap is leaking and is otherwise constantly losing water. So please close the lever again! There is also a shower on the left before the bridge and everything is free, so everything is great here and there is nothing to complain about except to say THANK YOU!"
25562,1775171,2,swatch,06/03/2022,"No water, no toilets, no showers. what is the point of having a CC car park if nothing is open or functional?.. The place is very beautiful however"
25562,1774292,3,Rberg,05/03/2022,right now there is no water at all. When it rains a lot of dirt due to sandy parking space.
25562,1773462,5,DeReizigers,04/03/2022,"Very nice place to stay. Unfortunately, a big storm when we were there and therefore not able to enjoy the area enough. At 19.00 the baker passes by, honking loudly, as soon as he stops you can buy bread, cookies, etc. We slept very peacefully."
25562,1764282,5,carmonavitor,24/02/2022,"very large flat parking, gray water drain and water filling."
25562,1762480,4,hilded,21/02/2022,Nice and good place along a lagoon. Bins to sort available. Please use the indicated camperparking. Honking car is the baker.
25562,1756844,4,Kerbside,15/02/2022,"Large area, quiet and peaceful. Beach is a stones through away. Grey and black water disposal but fresh water tap is not designed to attach a water hose as there are no threads on the spigot. Ok to fill up bottles though."

25562,1727517,5,luanccp,06/01/2022,Very quiet place. You can sleep listening to the sound of the sea.
25562,1722384,5,VanFather,01/01/2022,"Super peaceful place with beautiful beach, great sunset view from the cliffs and the services you need. Toilets are closed for the winter.
Stayed five nights without any issues. Highly recommended"
25562,1715874,5,NatashaBOK,26/12/2021,Beautiful location with water filling and disposal. Would have loved to surf at the beach but during this time the waves are not beginner friendly. Stayed 2 nights. You may notice a local car that has a hilarious clown-like horn in the evenings and ATV riders but no one bothers you. Felt safe.
25562,1714056,5,MaryundFlo,22/12/2021,Perfect place with the possibility to fill up with water and to dispose of waste water. Very flat and lots of space. In just a few steps you can reach an ingenious beach. We will definitely be back.
25562,1704401,5,PaulinaOnTour,06/12/2021,Super pitch. View of the lagoon and after 100 meters you are on a great beach! Totally quiet and residential area you don't notice at all.
25562,1696883,4,Rasjahcor,24/11/2021,"I don't give it 5 stars because the drinking water tap is impossible to plug in with any adapter and because the parking lot is partially flooded, which does not give much security. For the rest it is a quiet, beautiful and lonely place at this time of year. Thanks to the city council for thinking about the group!"
25562,1696535,3,caropaulovan,23/11/2021,"Unfortunately nothing for us as we sleep in the roof tent. It's nice to have ""solid walls"" around you. What you unfortunately cannot see in the pictures: right next to a street / housing estate."
25562,1676112,4,EmielEefje,03/11/2021,Nice place. The ground is a bit less due to a lot of rainfall. Also really great. Almost right on the sea. Can blow hard.

25562,1522896,2,SabineMary,28/08/2021,"Especially with the uncertainty about Portugal's current handling of free standing, the place is great: you are expressly allowed to stand, there is water, a small, cute cafe in front and the toilet. That's why we stopped by here on the way back: unfortunately the gnat infestation was so exhausting that I wanted to write this here. It stops next to a stagnant body of water ..."

25562,1203629,4,anf21,17/05/2021,"Very well suited for camping cars and vans - it is allowed to stay there. You don’t get a direct view on the ocean but it’s only a 2min walk to the beach. Parking is next to some houses, very little traffic but still a lively area. Good spot, nothing amazing but nothing bad either."

The baker drives to the square every evening and you can order bread for the next day. The fishmonger comes every Saturday. The local people tell you when the water rises higher. Then you can use the parking lot until the place is dry again.

25562,959006,4,Dael85,13/08/2020,"Last year we had a large free space to park, but this year the parking lot has shrunk ... there are still free services, beautiful tranquility, the beach 2 steps away, and room for a good dozen of motorhomes. Very nice stage !!"
25562,942472,3,hmachuka,09/08/2020,"Area in a nice place but in August it was crowded. We were able to sleep next to it because there is a lot of room apart. Restrooms 150m away, on the beach. Somewhat noisy. To spend one night in high season."
25562,941459,1,josemileo,08/08/2020,"Better not go, unfortunate road. When you get there it is a real village of motorhomes it is a shame for the sector. Places like this must be closed or denounce the landlines"
25562,926180,3,petriple,03/08/2020,A place without charm on the beach with the possibility of throwing black and gray water and drinking clean water.

A star deduction because it is often very loud and busy during the day: not only cars arriving and departing non-stop but quads, scooters, motocross machines one lap after the other with a howling engine turn ... sometimes a noise like in a circus, but luckily at night. So a nice place but during the day you get no rest and on the meadow everything is full of droppings."
25562,767127,5,steso,10/01/2020,Beautiful free parking lot with supply and disposal protected from the wind behind a bay. Toilets were closed.
25562,766046,3,AnneTheke,08/01/2020,"It was ok for one night. The surf was very loud, but you stand at the booth to get something out of the water. Nevertheless, I found it a bit scary there, the place behind us (3 WoMos in January) did not inspire confidence around the time. And there were free-range dogs, but they kept their distance. Toilets were locked, probably due to the time of year."
25562,754357,5,DavidDP,17/12/2019,"It is best to approach this Aire by going first to the village of São Pedro da Cadeira and then down to the coast. Otherwise, particularly if coming from the north, you may find yourself on narrow dirt roads with few passing places and tight turns."
25562,739238,5,wittgenstein,06/11/2019,"In November we slept alone in the area. total tranquility The bathrooms are closed, the key is in the beach kiosk that is next to the walkway. At this time there are hardly any mosquitoes."

25562,515607,5,E.Borges,14/06/2019,"Ample space to park, ground but level. Download and reload service totally free. Showers and toilets running. Although the parking lots are next to a river that is a protected area, there is a bridge to access a large beach, although there are areas forbidden to the bathroom because of their danger. Beware of mosquitoes."
25562,487629,4,MrTIW,19/05/2019,"Stayed here two nights, the first night which was a Friday was peaceful but the second night there was some noise from the local bar/cafe, nothing major though!

Unfortunately, the ground was quite wet due to rain, so we did not want to be able to stand in the river on the peninsula. Pretty much garbage. This but thank God not on the beach. We found the dogs as sympathetic, had owners. We did not meet others"
25562,358621,5,jackcld,29/08/2018,We camped overnight with 5 people one camper van and two tents! A little bit windy and some strange dogs running around but otherwise an excellent spot close to the beach!!!

25562,261717,4,padraigl,31/05/2018,Parking on scrubland beside an estuary. You have to cross a foot bridge to get to the beach. There is some soft sand on parts of the drive in. If you arrive late do not take a chance. A nice 35min cliff walk to Cambelas for small shop and bread. The local cafe was not open. The water currents are very strong for swimming. The fresh water tap has wrong connection. It's on the black water tap.
25562,257599,5,melodiejulian,22/05/2018,Really nice spot! great beach! quiet. we were only 3 vehicules to spend the night. You even have a cold shower near the wooden bridge behind the bar.

25562,186486,4,jerovega7,28/08/2017,"Very quiet place, a meadow with a lot of space. With all the services of emptying and filling, near village, with 20 houses, where to buy fruit and fish. Beach guarded and very wide. It is curious that some comments are more fixed on the dog poop found, than in the trash left by the people who pass by here. In spite of everything, very calm, especially at dawn."
25562,184578,4,Naty65,25/08/2017,"Quiet place and with enough space, the only complaint is that there are many cows of dogs left loose and this is the result, you can empty and catch water."

25562,173790,4,Huracan,13/08/2017,"There is plenty of space, some areas somewhat dirty by the same users, protected from the wind. The big problem of this and other areas, is the amount of dog droppings there are. We woke up in the morning and were surrounded by dog ​​droppings, there is no respect or education, no matter where the country is."
25562,172414,5,laetip,12/08/2017,"Ideal for large camper, families with children and animals. Large supervised beach. Beach volley nets. Thank you to the municipality of Torres Vedras for this free and very practical supply area."

Be careful not to park near the lagoon if there is a risk of rain because the river brings the waters of the nearby hills and floods the ground. Better stay on top near the parking lot. Free services available, thank you to the municipality."

The next town can be easily reached via the wooden footbridge in the dunes. Toilet/shower in the aqua park next door, quite far away, but free to use and clean. The beach bar is great. 2 nights/1 van/2 people (no electricity) = €24."

Beach 1 min away Town with bars, market, shops, restaurants 5 min away by bike along the promenade Very friendly staff I don't give it 5 stars because of a bit of neglect in the maintenance. So everything, surely, we will repeat."
25564,3247608,4,RiaA,01/09/2023,Excellent place with extremely helpful staff that seem to speak multiple languages. Directly beside the beach. Only four stars because the toilets and showers are only accessible once the waterpark closes. Would definitely recommend if in the area. We had dinner in the Mare Restaurant and Gin bar in the nearby town and it was 10/10. Only a 20 minute walk along the boardwalk into the town.
25564,3246211,5,arratie,01/09/2023,"The Ac is great. Direct access to the beach, paying 4.50/person aquapark, 1 small building with cafes, sofa, TV, table football... The best without a doubt 1 VERY EDUCATED guy, Miguel, who spoke perfect Spanish. He alone already deserves the 5 stars . *The toilets and showers can only be used once the park closes, that would be the only drawback. Costa Nova is 8 kilometers away. Aveiro 20 minutes by car."
25564,3229687,5,ricardogotcha,28/08/2023,"I arrived late however, I was well received where they let me in without doing the Checkin and the next morning I would do it without problems. It was great because I was already tired from the trip and I really wanted to stay overnight to rest. The park is huge, in excellent condition, with access to the beach, with an extra-chargeable pool and super quiet."
25564,3226431,3,Pacrima,27/08/2023,"Expensive area for what it offers... bathing only from 6 pm to 10 am, unless you pay €4.50 for admission to the aquapark. And when you enter at 6:00 p.m. you can imagine how dirty it is... it also only has 3 showers per changing room for the number of people it hosts... and if you pay the €4.50 it costs you as much as a campsite... please, kind treatment, beach bar"
25564,3220405,5,windalo,26/08/2023,"Spectacular, next to the beach with a movie sunset, a beach bar, a water park for 4.5 Euros (we didn't get into it), an area for children, another for teenagers... the only thing, avoid being placed next to the entrance because there is a lot of noise from people parking their cars in the morning."

25564,3208838,4,oswaldo245,24/08/2023,uncomplicated. Camper to camper in August.
25564,3200370,5,IIS_4,22/08/2023,Ideal. For a little more euros you have access to the slides and the area even has activities for children. Next to the beach and slides. Ideal!
25564,3181673,4,LMV17,19/08/2023,"As the other comments say, it is a very good area for children. Very friendly Spanish-speaking staff. the Aquaplash is not bad and the minigolf is fun. Beach next door with a beach bar to watch the sunset. the only downside is that if you don't pay the entrance fee for the pool, €4.5 from 5 years old, you can't enter the toilets...no shower or WC from 10-18h there is no easy possibility to use a bike"
25564,3170818,5,Burbulin,18/08/2023,"Better area than many camping, in front of a spectacular, wild beach with a beach bar. The Area has: a pool area with Aquapark-style slides (€4.5), minigolf, swings and a green area. Right next to it there is a free parking lot where you can spend the night, but for the price of the area (€12 high season, €9 low)... To put a downside, you can only shower after 6:00 p.m. if you don't access the pool."
25564,3164357,5,MamenZ,17/08/2023,"We have loved the area, next to an infinite beach of fine sand, good facilities, ideal if you go with children, good price and good service, we were so comfortable that we did not want to leave, we wrote down in the agenda that sooner rather than later we will return."
25564,3153324,5,Hippielina,15/08/2023,"So far the best campsite we have found in Portugal. Super friendly with swimming pool and slide tower (salt water). You can surf, fly, horseback ride and it has a children's program at 7pm. Fresh rolls are delivered to the car early. We only wanted to stay one night but ended up staying a week. The beach is great and very very quiet even in high season. We will be back!"
25564,3152699,5,adria640prestige,15/08/2023,"We were going there for 1 night and we stayed 3 nights to visit Aveiro and Agueda. Parking flat, quiet and close to the beach. Very welcoming and friendly. The small park (swimming pool) next to it allows you to have a good time."

25564,3124790,4,LaRamonettadeBlan,11/08/2023,"It is a quiet place to spend the night. There is a small water park popular with foreigners whose entrance must be paid for apart from the parking lot, although it is the same establishment. Next door there is another very popular free parking lot where you can also spend the night. The beach bar is great, with live music and a good atmosphere. The beach is beautiful. It has sinks and a couple of cold showers."
25564,3120914,5,SonyGasteiz,11/08/2023,"Area with fantastic location. Very friendly, with all the services. It even has animation in the pool area. Clean filling and emptying. It has some must-have products for sale. They even bring you the bread to the plot. We'll be back. Thank you."
25564,3114317,5,PeterJasmin,10/08/2023,"A nice big pitch for €12 a night. We immediately felt comfortable. The beach is kilometers long and wide, beautiful white sandy beach.

25564,3104749,5,gorkaikutza,09/08/2023,"Very nice place, next to the beach, all services for 12 euros, and access to the pool for 4.5 euros per person."
25564,3096782,3,Pepa,07/08/2023,"A good place, but you can't shower unless the water park is already closed, since the toilets are inside (very clean) the sinks don't have water, the beach bar is very worth it, there are no shades, Precious beach"

25564,2935863,5,pan6ea,08/07/2023,"We really enjoyed our stay there. Arrived around 7pm and still could easily check in and got a nice place. The camping site is behind some dunes close to the sea and in the vicinity is a very nice and modern beach bar. Even though prices are a bit higher, we really enjoyed a drink at the beach. The toilets and showers were also very clean. 10/10 could recommend this place."
25564,2922526,5,Atargen,04/07/2023,"The place is extraordinary, wonderful and with all the necessary services. The owner Goreti very friendly and helpful.

25564,2807564,4,PipaFucina,01/06/2023,Very nice area next to an impressive beach and a beautiful beach bar with a fabulous sunset. Super flat and with a very comfortable emptying and filling service. The only drawback for summer is that there is not a shade.
25564,2799841,4,pepperdick,29/05/2023,"Great place right by the sea. Nice people who run the CP. Bread was brought to the place, what a service! 2 km from a village with some shops and restaurants. The shower was nice and warm, all with curtains which is a bit out of date."

25564,2791157,2,sonnybuddy,27/05/2023,The people who run it are very friendly- good luck to them but this isn't my idea of paradise. They won't accept credit cards - fair enough - but you can use it to measure the space between each vehicle.
25564,2791137,5,Macanni,27/05/2023,"Nice place, the management provided us with everything we needed"
25564,2790081,5,Marion70,27/05/2023,Very nice pitch. Very nice operator. At the beach bar you can sit in the sun and enjoy the sea. Highly recommended. We spent two nights here.
25564,2789020,5,Robinwomo,26/05/2023,"Very pleasant pitch behind the dunes. The two young operators of the place are very friendly and helpful. Small bar is right at the beach access, very pleasant to end the evening. Aveiro can easily be explored by bike from here."
25564,2787961,5,Yliana,26/05/2023,"Wonderful place to spend a few days, with a bike path next to the sea that leads to the town where there are provisions, cafes and restaurants. Right in front there is a bar to have cocktails. Very friendly reception. It has no shade, but next to it there is a water park that belongs to the same campsite. We spent 5 very pleasant days. RECOMMENDABLE."
25564,2777085,5,leopardventure,22/05/2023,"We have really loved it, they have treated us very well from the beginning. The area is very well close to the beach, its showers with hot water, sinks. Take a walk and find a hidden beach with its amazing bar."
25564,2761212,5,kingkalle,18/05/2023,"Our insider tip: endless beaches, a great beach bar and a charming hostess. Shower and toilet ok. we will always make a stop here when we are traveling in Portugal. Price/performance top."
25564,2738052,5,janoderso,10/05/2023,Great for the price. Great beach right in front of the door. Nice beach bar. Showers not pretty but big and good water pressure. Great bike ride to Aveiro. Nice atmosphere.
25564,2720909,5,lottar94,03/05/2023,We were very grateful that we got a place on the full weekend. On May 1st it got super empty again. Right on the beach and really nice operators
25564,2715276,3,pocketpunki,01/05/2023,"On the May bank holiday it has been crazy, there were a lot of people and they kept accepting more, in the end there were motorhomes anywhere. 4 showers and the water was not hot. Very old and worn facilities. It has almost no grass, just a small area with a lot of slope, the rest earth or sand, no shade. Cheap to go to the beach, but nothing special."
25564,2697177,5,Gellis,25/04/2023,"Very nice! For 9€ per night more than okay. Directly at the sea with an endless beach. Beautiful footbridge to the city with nice restaurants and very good laundry facilities in town (washing laundry on the CP is a bit complicated). The showers were warm, the toilets ok. Barbecue facilities, lawns, playground...Minigolf and slide park are currently being renovated. Unfortunately only cold water for rinsing."
25564,2688816,5,Rhithik,22/04/2023,Friendly owner. Beautiful beachfront location. We paid 9 euros without electricity. Nothing to complain about.
25564,2676315,5,juancosta,17/04/2023,"Ample place to park, quiet area for motorhomes. Very comfortable and clean loading and unloading area. We paid 9 euros without electricity. With elecidad it is 3 euros more."

25564,2663997,4,silvio135,12/04/2023,"We spent a quiet night here, the site is more of a pitch than a campsite. It is right by the sea and dunes protect it well from the wind. The toilets in the Aqua Park were okay, one day only one worked, which unfortunately was very dirty. The showers are nice and warm and you can order bread rolls. Really okay for €9."
25564,2655643,4,Karlithos,09/04/2023,"Very happy with the spaciousness of the venue and the number of services it has. Clean. The attention is good. The defect that I would give is that the toilets are missing their seat covers and the sinks were clogged, perhaps something specific??? Little vegetation, pebble floor, I would prefer something more natural, but we were very comfortable, the place is pleasant and very spacious and they take good care of you."
25564,2652928,5,VeraLis,09/04/2023,"100% recommendable. It has many places, in front of the beach, bathrooms, showers... we came at Easter, and well, it wasn't full, but this in summer has to be a little candy. Congratulations on this space. We have been very happy these days here."
25564,2649977,5,cheregp,08/04/2023,"We were in doubt whether to end here or in the campsites. We have made the right choice, next to the beach, many ACs but there is a lot of tranquility, the receptionist Goreti is charming and helpful, we came for 1 day but in the end we stayed for 3, moving with the AC to visit Aveiro. If you bring a bike it catches you at 7km costa nova, although with the AC you can park without problem too. highly recommended"
25564,2647903,4,txampe,07/04/2023,"Perfect motorhome area with all kinds of services for a low price, 9 euros without electricity and next to the beach. There is a tiny Aquapark that seems to be part of the area since the bathrooms in that area are used. It also has grills and mini golf... We give it 4 stars because we were near the entrance to the beach and you can hear the noise from the beach bar at night"
25564,2629215,4,Mijeanne,29/03/2023,Perfect even if the sanitary facilities are far from the motorhome parking lot. The Sevices are very practical and suitable for any type of motorhome. Access to the village is facilitated by a long wooden footbridge on the top of the dune.
25564,2627976,5,Steinbock56,28/03/2023,"Super location, prices as described, bread service, the possibility to use the showers and toilets is pointed out"

25564,2599328,4,KEPJG,05/03/2023,More of a Motorhome site than a parking. Next to a beautiful unspoilt sandy beach and very quiet. €9.00 All services but limited EHU (an extra €4). Welcoming owner. Washing machine plus drier also on site with washing lines provided. Next to small water park (closed). Easy walk into pretty town - lovely super at Kikito.
25564,2595904,5,maxmstrmann,02/03/2023,Great pitch right on a beautiful beach! I have worked from here and I can say that the reception is perfect. Was able to conduct video conferences without it jerking or anything.
25564,2591988,5,JDraaijer,26/02/2023,Beautiful place and fully equipped. Delicious by the sea! Playground and mini golf for the kids. Accessible for larger campers. Current is 6 amps.

25564,2582441,5,crash1710,18/02/2023,I have stopped here twice now as the beach is incredible at sunset and sunrise. The owners are very helpful and I loved having pastries hand delivered in the morning. No problem just turning up during the week although I’d imagine weekends are busy.
25564,2581710,5,Kaylie1990,18/02/2023,"Planned to stay 1 night but stayed 3. We only left to adhere to the schengen rule, otherwise would of stayed longer. Nice open space. Beach just over the sand dunes which the kids adored. Cafe/bar right next to the beach (not associated with the site) Huge beach with soft sand. Can hear the waves at night which was a plus for us. Really great value for money. Also right next to a water park (guessing is only open in high season) Couldn’t of asked for more. Thank you for a lovely stay"

25564,2561686,5,u3900256,27/01/2023,Nice place. Direct beach access. Bar with delicious drinks and a small selection of dishes. Bread service available. W-LAN incl. value for money very good
25564,2558727,5,Felozamans,23/01/2023,"In our opinion of Ana and Rafael de Vigo, this area is the essence of the old campsites in a natural environment 50 meters from the beach separated by a dune, the ground is sandy, it has a swimming pool that is charged separately with a water park for children, barbecues, and electricity and the owners are 10, we will repeat, well, we will repeat"
25564,2552943,5,Chd1,16/01/2023,"Very nice pitch, friendly owner and quiet.Nice beach. Would come back anytime. thanks"

25564,2540784,4,estiwi8,04/01/2023,"The stay is cheap 9 euros two people in a small van. The space is large, the only drawback is that the showers and the bathroom are an 8-minute walk from where you are staying, for the rest everything is perfect. The girl at the reception is very friendly and everything is correct."
25564,2538291,4,LoloMimilSoso,02/01/2023,"Welcoming lady, parking near the beach, you can hear the waves well. But no direct view of the beach. Clean parking with Electricity, water, shower, WC for 12€ per night. The only downside is that the shower + WC are much too far from the parking lot. At around 400m. Don't want to use them at night."

25564,2510693,5,doggoontour,02/12/2022,"The perfect place for us: all the basics like toilet, shower and VE available but no frills. Everything could be cleaner, but that doesn't bother us. The bays are big enough. The operators are totally friendly and helpful. The beach right behind the dunes is really beautiful! It's quiet, the people relaxed.. Book 2 nights directly, it won't stay at one anyway ;)"
25564,2508871,5,jdgraaf,29/11/2022,"A lot of comments about the hassle of using the toilet etc, but hey what a place and what a beach for 10€ per night. In summer it felt a bit like the ‘Burning man festival’ and had a great time. Small beach bar and via a wooden promenade acces to a bakery (2-3km). Dog beach and sunshine!!! And the toilet….. they have one at the beach bar as well :-)"
25564,2508313,4,cdulbecco,28/11/2022,a good place to spend a few days in Portugal. all services for 12 euros including electricity. The only problems are the bathrooms are 400 meters away. At night it gets complicated. also that the front parking is free so many people walk to the beach between the motorhomes

The space, the water, the electricity on the pitches, the emptying, the possibility of ordering breads, croissants. a bar by the sea with good music and a welcoming and friendly bartender. superb walks to do shopping accessible on foot.and the extreme kindness of the manager to whom I send my admiration.

25564,2367418,5,carlalopes,13/09/2022,"Park well located, close to the beach (falling asleep to the sound of the sea), walkway in the dunes good for walking. The changing rooms should provide more privacy in the shower area (uncomfortable to undress/dress). Good beach."

25564,2323404,3,u1277,31/08/2022,Good service and safe. Too dusty with the wind though. Unfortunately we didn't see the nebrnan car park when we arrived at night. That would have been much nicer.
25564,2316634,5,giada90,29/08/2022,"strategic position, near the beach, and a small water park with minigolf, which does not cause any disturbance. on the beach there is a bar and just behind a surf school. a walk on a footbridge leads to the town center. barbecue area and sinks for washing dishes / clothes. the only cons are the bathrooms, which are a bit far away because those in the water park are used."
25564,2314686,5,magalhetas,28/08/2022,simply spectacular I recommend
25564,2312953,5,simonlopez,28/08/2022,"Area with all services. During the water park season, the showers and bathrooms open from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 a.m., the rest of the year all day with free showers. Small water park and saltwater pools and beach 50 meters with a super beach bar. the village a km down the boardwalk.This is our third stay here in four months and we will certainly keep coming back."

It has restrooms open from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 a.m. Fairly calm and quiet at night. The people who run it are very friendly."
25564,2306974,5,Barambelitos,27/08/2022,"great for us. We arrived the first day and there was no electricity available, they put us on the waiting list and the next morning they came to tell us. the great Aquapark, and the miniature golf too, one day the weather was bad and they had a movie session for the kids (Free and they gave them popcorn and sweets). the huge plot, and the area is really very quiet. The environment is 10."
25564,2296425,4,frichera,24/08/2022,"The caravan area is not bad, especially for the water park. The area is large and they park motorhomes where they can, improvising. The services are somewhat improvable. The sinks are somewhat worn. The unloading area is large and comfortable, but the system for blacks is an open toilet, which is not very hygienic. The showers are free from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., they are the ones in the park"
25564,2292623,1,jeltijonas,23/08/2022,"Pros: right on the beach! Showers are a disaster, not to mention the toilets! For the entire campsite 1 men's toilet seat without toilet seat ... what can you say?! In addition, you are not “allowed” to go to the toilet during the day. We had one on board, but if you're traveling without a wet room, be aware of that!"
25564,2292488,1,tanquetus,23/08/2022,"the biggest chaos in the world, I arrived at 1am and the day ends at 4:00 p.m., there are no showers, only from 6:00 p.m., it took me a while to locate from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., a lot dust, the super arrogant reception manager, the young girls very well."
25564,2287905,5,VanPieron,23/08/2022,"Very friendly staff at the reception. We stayed 2 nights at the back of the dune, very quiet (place without electricity). Right next to a nice big beach."
25564,2279676,5,lejnala,21/08/2022,"Very nice people at the reception. Everything very organized and tidy. And the place is great too! There are warm showers which you can use after the outdoor pool is closed (7:00 p.m. - 10:00 a.m.), a social room, the possibility to do laundry, wash dishes and the sea is right next door. A wonderful place behind the dunes."
25564,2272478,5,Buhostudio,20/08/2022,Perfect for children with an aquapark. close to the beach and cheap with all services. super friendly staff. Shower hours between 18 and 10. I would go back for sure.

25564,2270718,3,waxy,20/08/2022,"The site is spectacular and very good but it has gotten out of hand. It's fine if you get one of the plots upstairs or in the corner, but if you get downstairs (like us) and they put you in the middle of a parking lot, the morning after the neighboring ACs left we looked like a mushroom. Paying €10 for that is not worth it. Better to park next door, which is the same and free. There is no electricity for everyone"
25564,2270175,4,PercyNoblemann,19/08/2022,"Very nice beach with outdoor pool, playground next door, entry 4 €. From 18.00-10.00 in the morning free entry for toilets & showers. Upper part of the site is sandy and there is no electricity. Shops about 10 minutes away by bike. Owners try hard & friendly but you shouldn't expect a 4* campsite. All in all a great place to stay for a few days with kids"
25564,2265588,4,Edgar13ch,19/08/2022,"Cost per day in August €10. The owners are very friendly but a little more control is lacking, cars sneak in to park, the water to refill the tank was hot, the use of bathrooms and showers has limited hours. They have very limited electricity."
25564,2265581,5,autobusero16,19/08/2022,Good place to enjoy and rest the sunsets are spectacular and the attention to us very good for me a ten
25564,2258767,4,Poipo76,18/08/2022,"Around this site there are 2 grass esplanades where you can spend the night without any problem. We entered this because of the theme of the pool and the children. But to go to the beach without hesitation I would stay out. The GNR passed by outside and didn't say anything, except if you parked next to the fence of the campsite. Very nice campsite staff. It has all the services. Of course, they allowed the place to be overcrowded. All a bit tight."
25564,2257890,5,vir4punto0,17/08/2022,Special place very close to the beach! Super friendly staff!! We will repeat!!! Do not forget to stop by the Xiringuito that is right at the entrance to the beach!

Very large and tidy area, place for barbecue, emptying and refilling water, super nice beach next door and on top of that, for putting the motorhome in you have a 50% discount in the slide park. The children had a great time, there was mini golf too. Very friendly and helpful staff. We will definitely return as soon as we can."

25564,2056734,5,AmyWH,10/07/2022,Great park for a family with children under 14 years. After travelling along way it was a welcomed find.  We don’t speak Portuguese and the staff had very limited English but the owners couldn’t have been more accommodating. Great find we will definitely re-visit.
25564,2054806,4,lolags,09/07/2022,Recommended place to spend the day on the beach. We came with a van and the place to park was an esplanade with dirt and rubble. Bathrooms are ok but can't be used from 10am to 6pm (if you don't pay for the pool). Very nice staff. The beach is great and you can get to the town on foot without any problem. €10 per night.

25564,1815709,5,Josla,11/04/2022,"The location right on the dunes is worth 5 stars, plus bread service to the mobile home, reasonable supply and disposal (drinking water). The very large space is still passable even after heavy rain, partly gravel, partly grass, even for very large mobile homes. Dog-friendly very nice operator, good for several days vacation."

The man at the front desk was very friendly and gave us good tips for activities and breakfast choices. The WiFi is great. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is the outdated sanitary facilities. We would definitely come again.

25564,1791019,5,ReinerWilkus,21/03/2022,"It couldn't be nicer! You feel welcome and just fine, although the place itself still has potential. Beach and landscape wonderful, the place Vaguera is unfortunately a pure vacation spot with little soul. Despite the negative points around it, the space and above all the hosts make it family."

It is more a campsite than an area elsewhere (motor homes, bungalows, reservations ...) the proximity of the beach and the installation of the footbridge over the dune in the background a unique and brilliant place in winter in good weather. We were lucky !"
25564,1726126,5,paologallo77,04/01/2022,Very nice area! Owners were very kind. Services all good and clean. If we travel again in this area we will pay a visit for sure.

25564,1708247,3,anissabou,11/12/2021,"The owners are very friendly & the beach is beautiful! On the other hand, the sanitary block is several minutes walk from the pitches and the first 3/4 days when I was there the showers and the toilets were not cleaned. I don't know how often it's done but it was dirty. On the other hand, the shower water is hot and it's super nice to have the beach 20 meters away."
25564,1704782,5,Darek69,06/12/2021,"For this time of year a wonderful place. Deserted beach, total tranquility. 100% nature. Very helpful and attentive owners. Complete facilities. Someone with a pet is not stressed as there is plenty of room to enjoy. We will be back."

I was originally going to explore more of the coast and try different places, but Daniel and Mélanie are just so god damn sympathetic and great hosts that I tossed the plan. They have everything I need, and I will be back again for sure as soon as I can. When you leave you are sad but you also have a smile on your face for all the good memories. I feel they genuinely care about their place and that they love meeting and talking to new people. They are also a great team. I was here with my daughter from Friday to Sunday. We just wanted to have a beach to throw a frisbee and the normal facilities. I love the atmosphere of this place, and if you want you can order bread that will be delivered to your door in the morning from these charming hosts. I will see you soon again. Just go there is what I am basically saying?"

25564,1675442,5,smithmul,02/11/2021,The road is indeed poorly informed on the GPS. You have to follow the signs for the small water park run by the owners of the area who are very helpful and friendly. They speak French. The pitches are simple but efficient and the direct access to a superb beach was a nice surprise. Inexpensive (€ 11.50 with electricity). One for the delivery of bread to the truck. Thank you
25564,1675056,5,sunflowernomads,02/11/2021,"Google maps sends you off the road down R. praia Nova. When driving from Costa Nova. Don’t take off down R. praia Nova, just keep going and you will get Vagasplash on your right hand side:)"
25564,1673788,5,moustash,01/11/2021,"An unexpected stay - came in the evening for a desperate hot shower (actually not €1, but €2.50 per person), but for the price of €5 for two of us, it was just as well to stay and enjoy the area for the evening and the next day for just €11.50 with electricity (€8.50 without) bargain!They're so lovely and welcoming, they gave us their 'best spot for surfers' right by the dunes next to the beach."
25564,1671309,5,Daniel_87,31/10/2021,"Super cheap, great location right behind the dunes. On the other side there is a nice beach and great waves. Employees are super nice and helpful, the bread service is great and cheap. In the evening a round of orders is made and in the morning the bread rolls are delivered directly to the mobile home. Highly recommended, we stayed for a second night straight away."
25564,1670795,5,irieman,31/10/2021,Everything your heart desires less than 100 meters from the beach. 15 min by foot to the city. Bread service in wind and weather. Raging waves included ... we love it.
25564,1670293,5,sunflowernomads,31/10/2021,"Vagasplash is the perfect place! I stayed here 26-28.10.21. I recommend this 100%! I felt truly welcome here. Daniel and Mélanie are such attentive and kind hosts. In general just very nice people. Good vibe and great service! Place for autocaravan with electricity for 11,50€. They also have bungalows. Bread ? delivery (with several options) to your van in the morning if you want. As a vegan I had the Bico and they were great! Other things I liked: Hot showers with good water pressure. Huge beach, cold beers, very good wi-fi. They have a very nice grill and dish washing area. Great pools and sunbathing area with water slides. A very cozy place. I will be back in a couple of weeks for sure! See you there!

PS: Don’t follow Google maps! They make you turn in R. Praia Nova. Just keep going and follow the map on Park4night or regular Maps!"

As for tranquility, we had some marchers next to us but they respected the hours of sleep, the rest of the area seemed calmer. As the only suggestion, I would improve the floor at least in the parking area so as not to bring so much dust inside."

25564,1424230,4,Reiseeuphorie,08/08/2021,"The place is a bit barren, but convinces with its location directly on the sandy beach and with beautiful jetties along the coast. The place is separated from the sea by a dune, so there is no direct view of the sea. When we arrived on Saturday at 5:00 p.m., only places without electricity were available. But we got an alternative power connection from the friendly staff."

The people who manage the log are very nice and attentive. Family atmosphere with children. As the previous comments say, very cheap: 10e the camper, 3e electricity, 4e the water park per person. The showers are inside the water park so between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. you cannot access it, that's the only downside"

The parking space directly behind the dunes is an advantage in windy conditions, but only if you don't need electricity. The Agua parc is small, but absolutely ok for € 3.50. That the showers of the swimming pool can only be used after 6:00 p.m. was not a problem for us."
25564,1386210,5,meikegh,31/07/2021,"Very nice, relaxed place with access to the beach. Carlos and the other employees are very friendly and helpful. We felt comfortable and would have stayed longer if the weather had cooperated :)"

In the morning they bring bread that you reserve the day before and a van also comes with the typical stuffed boliños. If you need something they will surely get it for you. We came for one night and spent three. I will repeat"

It has mini golf and a mini water park that is under maintenance right now, in summer they tell me that it also has a supermarket and more activities for children. They are SUPER friendly, to the point that I asked at the reception if they had ibuprofen and someone went to the pharmacy and brought me a box. They also ask everyone who wants to bring fresh bread or croissants for breakfast the next morning. Logically they charge it just like they charged me for ibuprofen but the fact that they provide that service precedes me fabulous. Carlos in particular is super friendly, he explains everything you need from both the area and the surroundings. We will repeat without a doubt."

There are squares with electricity paying an extra and others without electricity. Very level and cared for. There is an aquapark next door and it is 2-3km from the town.

The only downside, before nightfall, two cars came to drift, but they left after 15 or 20 minutes. I suppose that if there had been more motorhomes or campers, they would have left without further ado. Other than that, fully recommended."

You have to pay 1 euro for a shower, but for 12 minutes. You also need toilet paper. We wanted to have a bite to eat at 7 p.m., but it was a bit difficult because they closed at 8 p.m., but it was still allowed. For 1 night it's ok"

The campsite in general is very neglected. Located in a very noisy environment, surrounded by roads and highway. You have to pay €1 for the shower and because of this they should be cleaner, more cared for and with more space."
25652,2182904,1,Franciscofrade,06/08/2022,We've been on the road for 2 weeks and this was without a doubt the worst campsite we've been to. old and uncomfortable bathrooms. road noise all night. if you arrive at 7pm you can no longer use the pool the next morning. horrible price. 31 euros van and two adults. staff.....I didn't see anyone except the lady who charged us for the night.

We were no expecting this: simple but effective camping (services, reception, pub...), adjacent to a Motel and a water park wich has had its golden age probably in the late nineties. One can hear the cars on the road but other than that and the price, it was OK."
25652,2138571,2,dantas33,28/07/2022,"Pleasant campsite close to the highway. All services are correct. On the other hand the price is excessive for one night, an adult, a child and a van with electricity we paid 31€ per night! In addition, you still have to add 1€ for 15min of hot water in the shower and per person! We won't be going back there for sure!"

Very poor, old bathrooms, paperless toilet, toilet only, no cover. The shower is terrible, it is muffled and they charge you € 1 for 12 'of hot water. The day for 1 car with 2 adults and 2 children is € 43, and the pool is only enjoyed on the day of entry. If you want to stay after 12 noon, you pay a whole day more, and if you want to use the pool on the day of departure it is € 26 for 4 people, yes, the pool opens at 11.30."
25652,651240,2,mariedanner,22/08/2019,Camping a little old. The pool complex is not very popular even if it is really big. Price quite expensive for one night (40 euros) but there is not much choice in this corner. It goes for a stage.
25652,638306,2,vinilo,17/08/2019,"Leave a little to be desired. The campsite has lived its best for many years. The plots are very spacious but super depopulated with grass. The shower, you have to pay for hot water, bathrooms not very clean, no toilet paper. Very noisy in general because it is next to the road and the municipal pool (which falls within the price of the plot) and the pool is fine because there are quite a few pools and slides even though it is neglected"

One euro for showering you. the only good thing is the plots with shade and that in the price the pools enter. If you go with children it is ideal to spend a day of rest on the route. 26e the plot with right to the pool can be accepted. but only for that. WC and shower better in your own motorhome"

So please do not take out chairs, tables, awnings, do not put chocks and take the garbage if the bucket is full. If we are civic and only park, it will endure as a great place"
25671,2400487,4,Guillico,24/09/2022,9/22/22 The land belongs to the same owner as the one a little higher up and who closes in the afternoons.

So no chairs, tables, awnings or falcas, or the police come and we all load. It's not so hard to respect that, right?"

Easily accessible, the regular bus also comes, but pay attention to the sign P-bus that is already indicated at the bottom of the village.

Nice terrace on square with nice coffee. Beautiful walks can be made (sign with routes are on the square on the left.) The old houses at the top of the village are worth a walk Have a quiet night Separation of waste is possible in containers one floor higher There is a lot of drinking water at taps if you a number of bottles along.Waste water can you discharge above the wells in the parking lot though I do not know if that is the intention.Al in all good place though it is a normal parking area also for buses.Wij stood here alone, can in the summer I think it's busy."

25682,224048,4,rvanvugt,22/02/2018,"In the German and French description it says Trevelez is the highest village in Spain. This is not correct, the highest village is Valdelinares at an altitude of 1692m. Trevelez is at 1530m.

True is that Trevelez is recognised for their Jamón, which is indeed very delicious.

The parking is at the end and top of a steep street, easy accessible and good for a night staying here. Its a tarmacked parking without any attractions, just a simple parking. Nice walk down into town or going into the mountains. Quiet and no problems at all.

Attention: market on Wednesday, no parking possible till market is finished!"

I would give zero. 90% permanent campers, the space for us is at the back and maybe 2 football fields in size. The permanent campers walk their dogs there and they do their business there!

We are far from the city on foot and it is very steep. The only positive point of the campsite is the cleanliness of the toilets. In short, I do not recommend for campsites because."
