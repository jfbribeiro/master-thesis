18111,3275385,1,Carloscharlie,09/09/2023,nothing recommended. It's a shame because the area is impressive but it has been ruined by mass tourism. Horrible bathrooms and toilets.
18111,3170612,1,pirataclimb,17/08/2023,"dirty toilets and campers, campers and motorhomes in a corner, all full of kampoach type shops, it's a shame"
18111,3170510,1,Beron,17/08/2023,"I will never come back. They charge in advance, and they do not return the money if you leave before You are bursting the essence of campsites of a lifetime, turning it towards a posh and unfamiliar tourism, in addition to reserving the best places in the campsites for this service and end up belittling the usual camper and relegate him to third world places within the most idyllic campsites on the coast."
18111,3167020,1,Jime,17/08/2023,A shame those from kampaoh have acquired for the pijitos. The campers and others are not well received.
18111,3147134,4,icephoenix180,14/08/2023,"Almost all glamping but great location over the sea with access to two beaches. Alternative: pool. Most of the place is glamping, nice tents and small wooden huts, of different sizes. Prices vary greatly depending on the season and day of the week from <100€/night to > 200€/night and tent. Usually two night minimum, small supermarket. hardly any ""normal"" camping anymore."
18111,3136425,1,Isravanlife,13/08/2023,"Always full, it seems that they don't want to bring people in, only those who rent the Indian tents already installed and at exorbitant prices, after calling a lot and as we were passing by, we stopped to ask and outside there were about 8 campers waiting for a place, they didn't know if they would have, sorry."
18111,3091227,1,flobaz,06/08/2023,"Indeed all vans and motorhomes are out of places with sea view, away. Too bad because the place is magical."
18111,3080779,1,LaGalerna,05/08/2023,"Hopefully the glamping bubble will burst very soon... I understand that they will be making much more money in a very short time but that campsite was my paradise, which no longer exists for my own van or tent..."
18111,2947328,1,Robem,10/07/2023,"Disappointing... this is no longer what it used to be... Now it is intended for people who want to sleep in wooden tents at hotel prices. The essence of camping as such has disappeared, they only allow camping in a remote meadow, no views and next to the road at high prices... a pity"
18111,2887578,1,cambro,24/06/2023,As campground has practically ceased to exist it is a wigwam motel. A pity for those of us who enjoyed many years of it.
18111,2847078,1,besclaan,12/06/2023,"Arrived on June 12, 2023. Due to the placement of houses, you end up at the back of the campsite without a view, but more than 41 euros"
18111,2821118,1,mikelov,04/06/2023,"As a van / camper / caravan a disappointment. Kampaoh has acquired the campsite and has put up a bunch of tents overlooking the sea. For campers who do not want a tent already installed, only the back part remains, without sea views and further from the beach. outcast. A pity because last year, anarkia reigned and you located where you could, at this time, on the beach... a shit"
18111,2821030,1,coyotexx,04/06/2023,"Maybe there used to be no space for mobile homes. Pitch for WoMo is reminiscent of a football field without trees (shadow)! Priced for it too expensive 40E 2P u electricity! Beach only stones and on the way there a garbage accumulation! Only 1 toilet/shower house, long way there and not enough capacity for the number of places. Also not clean! Can not recommend the place because there are better and cheaper."
18111,2815798,1,wnolfiwomo,03/06/2023,"Was acquired by Kampaoh in 2023. All terraces, whose location was so praised, have been equipped with white-beige tents (like an army camp) since this year. For motorhomes only a part without a sea view remains at the very back. The emptying of the chemical toilet is far away from the mobile home area. Almost 40 € per night are taken from the unwanted guests for 2 people, mobile home and electricity with 5 amps (?!)."
18111,2815439,2,mowogra,03/06/2023,"Actually a great place. For mobile homes and campers, however, only pitches without a view in the furthest corner. The most beautiful places are prepared for glamping tents. Expensive and to be paid in advance. Electricity €5.50 per day and locked…."
18111,2815260,1,Condensator,03/06/2023,"Unfortunately, mobile homes are only allowed to stand in the ""rear"" part of the site. Here you can hardly see the sea anymore. The beautiful places (like in the photos) probably only for tents. We were immediately sent away from a nice place (although everything is free) The ""back"" place is nice but the expectation was to see the sea. For the parking space then too expensive 41 euros 2p + electricity."
18111,2813813,2,marcsharck,02/06/2023,Seems like from this year on the best places are for „glamping“ customers. Tents are set up with ocean view all over the place. Space for Campers / vans are all without ocean view. Based on the great reviews we were looking forward to this place but have been disappointed so far. 40€ per night is super expensive and they want to be paid in advance for whatever reason.
18111,2698678,3,mssm,26/04/2023,Currently closed.
18111,2465162,3,matthetmimi,27/10/2022,What a pity…. Privatized such a beautiful place and close it out of tourist season!!!!
18111,2424834,5,Friegelow,05/10/2022,"Super great place, free choice of seats, great view. Toilets and showers clean and tidy. A bay right on the square, a quieter bay for swimming (narrow way to get there) in front of the restaurant, a bit hidden. Washing machine and dryer also available. We paid 72.20 for 2 nights, 2 people with electricity, not cheap but we were happy to pay for the space."
18111,2398258,5,Chris9990,24/09/2022,"Best place on the north coast that we have come across. Lots of space with free seating. A little wilder with trees and greenery. Cozy with a great view of the sea, the sound of waves. Small supermarket. Bread must be ordered the day before. pool clean. Disposal & sanitary facilities etc. great. A small pebble beach can be reached directly from the pitch. Disadvantage: many lanterns with light at night."
18111,2374047,5,joellejunker,15/09/2022,Super nice campsite with lots of space and direct access to the sea. Great view directly from Platzt!
18111,2367096,5,ElNido,13/09/2022,"Very beautiful! One place more beautiful than the other with free choice. In September everyone will find one with a sea view! Sanitary super (showers a bit small), restaurant is ok, Pechon 10 minutes away by bike."
18111,2364075,5,eric33700,12/09/2022,"Very nice terraced campsite with free pitches. Very clean sanitary facilities, reception in French. A small well-stocked supermarket, a swimming pool and access to the sea on a cove with pebbles (shoes recommended). Very calm. Great campsite. Thank you for sharing"
18111,2354398,5,anairi,09/09/2022,Campsite on a hillside that ends at a beach. Beautiful views. Impeccable bathrooms and very good service from your staff.
18111,2348361,5,Wastl95,07/09/2022,"Beautiful campsite. The most beautiful one we've stood on so far (although I'm mostly wild and only rarely on campsites). You can choose the pitch freely, the space is laid out in terraces so that everyone can enjoy the sea view. Great sunset from the private beach. Good and clean sanitary facilities. Only the supermarket is a bit expensive, but you don't have to use it ;)"
18111,2335438,5,gabrielehelene,03/09/2022,A beautiful campsite with direct access to the beach. The places can be chosen freely and there are many beautiful corners and many places with sea views. The service is friendly and perfect. It's incredibly clean because they're constantly cleaning.
18111,2321130,5,onthegowithflow,30/08/2022,"Beautiful campsite by the sea. You have the freedom to choose a place yourself, many places with a beautiful view. Sanitary is very neat. Everything you need is available at the campsite. Camping is a bit more pricey than we are used to, but it is also worth it!"
18111,2299274,5,Carololek,25/08/2022,"Super nice campsite! Very large and lots of space, of course with terraces with a great view over the sea - or shady places on large meadows with old trees, something for everyone! Lots of sanitary - & washing stations - where cleaning is done all the time. With 2 beaches with exclusive access from the campsite - great! Unfortunately, a lot of rain in the area..."
18111,2296851,5,CecileFloVanLife,24/08/2022,Very good and large campsite! Magnificent view of the beach and direct access. 36€ for 2 people with Van and electricity. Swimming pool with sea view. Clean kind staff. We can only recommend
18111,2279328,4,RFRE,21/08/2022,Incredible location. free parking (not obvious because location not delimited) on the huge domain. pleasant swimming pool sanitary OK. convenient convenience store. 45€ for a van for 4 without electricity all the same.
18111,2273452,4,Syge,20/08/2022,"Large campsite, reasonable price, spectacular pitches, pleasant beaches at low tide, each trip builds your calves!"
18111,2249856,4,JAFFORD,16/08/2022,"Good place to spend the holidays, very nice, clean toilets and showers, it has a supermarket, to put something wrong you have to go early because they don't make reservations and there is a queue, we had to wait an hour and a half to get in, you have to be patient, it's free camping and pitches are not limited. Everything and so recommended 100%"
18111,2237209,1,adaymonic,14/08/2022,Very unfriendly staff
18111,2236475,4,gemmafont,14/08/2022,"Good campsite. They do not accept reservations, it is to arrive and look for a place. The plots are not marked, you search and take the site you need. The beach at the campsite has a spectacular sunset. The downside is that there are many slopes and to go to the bathroom or wash dishes, if you are down, it can be quite steep. The town is a short walk through a beautiful forest."
18111,2220057,4,broccardom,12/08/2022,"Extensive campsite on a very large hillside with free choice where they then come to connect and disconnect you by calling the reception. Very nice pools and very very clean bathrooms. It is connected to two beaches, one of pebbles and often with rough sea, the other with a path near the restaurant, which descends towards the river, much more peaceful and enchanting."
18111,2209133,5,scxllrd,10/08/2022,"Super campsite, 8.35€ per adult and 14.65€ for the place per day, it's more than fair. Impeccably clean sanitary facilities. Everyone chooses their place, I advise you to move to a beautiful place facing the ocean when it becomes available;) Supermarket on the campsite with fresh bread in the morning, helps out but remains quite expensive. 2 pebble beaches next to the unpopular campsite. I recommend !"
18111,2208912,5,bavaria1185,10/08/2022,"Super campsite free pitch, spectacular view, swimming pool with several clean toilets, cafeteria grocery store… really great even if in high season you have to be patient to enter but it's worth it."
18111,2201614,2,Buckel,09/08/2022,"It's high season! Very crowded, queuing to shower, all in all bustling. Great view for many places. Search for space hectic, as many people are looking at the same time. Everyone can take as much space as they need for their own camp, some people are ruthless. Bathrooms were cleaned several times :)! Beaches were just ok compared to the rest of the coast. Definitely great in the off-season!"
18111,2192101,4,malagaisa,07/08/2022,Very large camping site free. seats with a sea view are very popular. if you move away from the view you can have a large pitch but not much shade. disappointed with the swimming pool no deckchair to settle down and enjoy. both beaches are pebbly.
18111,2184914,4,doradruif,06/08/2022,Beautiful campsite if you arrive on time and put the camper/tent in such a way that no one can stand in front of you. Beach/pool and village within walking distance. Best campsite we have had in terms of possibilities and location.
18111,2178520,5,anoukieontheroad,05/08/2022,The location and especially the view (if you arrive on time and manage to get a spot) is fantastic! Friendly staff at the reception and clean sanitary facilities.
18111,2139413,1,picardsly,29/07/2022,arrived 8:30 p.m. no management of places it's just the mess to settle. very noisy in addition you pay for the tent whether it is 100m2 or 3 m2. if you have 2 tents you pay for 2. info that we did not have when we arrived (problem of communication with the person at the reception who spoke French). we will not be back. One of the people at the reception was not friendly. No negotiation
18111,2138633,4,SBranch,28/07/2022,"Our first night here. Toilets/showers are clean.  Free choice of pitch , a bit of an up and down drive to find a spot. Lovely swimming pool and beach ,  good security. Looking forward to visiting second beach tomorrow . Lovely visit but was a bit surprised by the €100 bill. 2 adults 2children ( classes as adults age 15 & 13) electricity and a separate charge for our van"
18111,2133473,5,reisenmituwe,27/07/2022,"Very beautiful! Spacious campsite, free choice of pitches. Some great sea views. Calm. New, clean sanitary facilities."
18111,2130512,5,ValentijnDeLille,27/07/2022,"Absolutely very nice location. Normally we visit motorhome parkings. But the view here is breathtaking. Services are also just good, clean and spacious."
18111,2126742,5,kloemi,26/07/2022,"Normally I like to be outdoors but I really liked this campsite. Super great pitches with breathtaking views, super clean and totally dedicated and friendly staff. A night with a van without electricity alone cost me €23, which I find perfectly acceptable for the high season."
18111,2107767,4,jotabelatz,22/07/2022,"Expensive, but with quality services. The only bad thing for me is that the plots are not delimited, you do not know very well where to put yourself, and when you return you may have a tiny space. Although the campsite is VERY large, most people concentrate on those with sea views. Overpriced supermarket. €31.35 Van for 2 adults, without electricity."
18111,2098958,5,Joerg1962,20/07/2022,Just happened to be here and visited the place on the spur of the moment. I have rarely seen such a fantastic place. Wow.
18111,2098409,4,julirka,20/07/2022,"A little factory, it comes and goes at all costs. Nice campsite for a break on the road, exceptional view and despite the crowd, relatively calm. On the other hand, very expensive, count 45€/night for a van, 2 adults and 2 children without electricity"
18111,2095154,5,kecorahe,19/07/2022,One of the best campsites we have seen. Tranquility and enclave to highlight. Wonderful views
18111,2067446,5,AnaKea,13/07/2022,"Beautiful place with two beaches (one at the river mouth and one at the open sea. Free choice of places and each place has something for itself. Even if you are not directly on the sea, you usually have a view and therefore more space and shade. Two pools, one of them for children .very clean sanitary facilities and good restaurant ."
18111,2059577,5,matian,11/07/2022,We love this place and would love to come back soon. There is everything you need plus a great view of the open sea and a wonderful sea surf at the front seats.
18111,2055034,5,Chris64240,09/07/2022,"Facing the ocean. Super campsite, huge, very clean, very welcoming, first come, first served. We spent 2 quiet nights there enjoying the beach"
18111,2050417,5,chello23,08/07/2022,I can only agree with the previous comments! Nicest campsite we have ever been to. Value for money. Absolute 10/10!
18111,2049702,5,NoeMar84,08/07/2022,A great place for motorhomes and campers. Near the sea. Beautiful views. Perfect to go with little ones. And everything very very clean.
18111,2041420,5,Ravelin727,05/07/2022,"There cant be many sites with better views than this one from many of the pitches, stunning. Very well landscaped and maintained site, if a bit hilly as it hugs the coastal hillside. The main toilet block is modern and spotlessly clean, with other blocks scattered around too. Not the cheapest of sites, and electricity hookup is only 5A, but we'd certainly return."
18111,2036402,5,Bienchen,04/07/2022,"Beautiful and lovingly landscaped place. From almost every pitch you have a magnificent view! The staff is very friendly and helpful, the sanitary facilities are super clean and very modern in the lower area. Well stocked supermarket. The beach is very nice, but rather pebbly. Less suitable for swimming. Very choppy waves."
18111,2022983,5,dadoncamillo,29/06/2022,"Great view, free choice of seats, clean sanitary facilities, hardly anything going on at the end of June, very quiet. own small beach and pool. Very nice and helpful. Very hilly. paid €36 for two with van and electricity at the end of June."
18111,2019751,5,angelgil,28/06/2022,"Friendly treatment, well-kept plots, common services (washbasins, bathrooms, showers, water change) very very clean and well-cared for. very nice location. It is a little more expensive than usual (36 €/day with electricity included) but it is worth it."
18111,1996175,5,SarahChrisW,20/06/2022,Fantastic campsite with spectacular sea view from many grassy pitches. Nice beaches and facilities are well-maintained. Restaurant tip: La Cambera in nearby town Pechón - great food!!
18111,1985473,5,JJCamper,17/06/2022,"Very nice view of the sea, nice pool, direct beach access and 2nd beach on the estuary. The staff is very friendly and the sanitary facilities are very clean. Nothing was going on at this travel time, we had the beach to ourselves. Since the place is very large, this can certainly be different in the high season."
18111,1984524,5,tatanamnam,17/06/2022,"We stayed here for 3 nights. It is very quiet and extremely clean. There was always someone cleaning something even though it was already spotless. The service is top. From the reception to the crew. We were missing the right adapter for electricity and were brought one free of charge within minutes. There is a store next to the reception, it has everything you need including fresh bread every morning. It’s best to reserve yours the day before. The lady at the store is the nicest person and her prices are more than fair. Comparable to groceries outside of the campsite. She even made the effort to bring stuff for us that she didn’t have, and didn’t charge us a penny extra and showed us the original receipt. One thing is, if you need wifi, it works best closest to the reception area. Otherwise, it is one of the nicest places we’ve been to. Will definitely come back!!"
18111,1980913,4,MZech,15/06/2022,"Very great view, nice pool. There is also a small beach bay. We paid about €35 per night with a mobile home and 2 small children (a bit more expensive). If you stay 3 nights, the fourth night is free. would come back"
18111,1957252,5,rolu,07/06/2022,"magnificent campsite that, at a low cost, offers spectacular views from the terraced pitches that allow everyone to see it. the greenery is well cared for as well as the toilets where cleaning is carried out several times throughout the day. very friendly and helpful staff. I advise !!!"
18111,1942188,5,Poppino,03/06/2022,"Great campsite! Everything you need for relaxation! Great restaurant and great pitches, free choice of space, sanitary facilities super clean! Open since June 1st. Terrace-shaped created with a fantastic view of the Atlantic"
18111,1895865,1,scottytheexplorer,17/05/2022,"Unfortunately closed, will probably be renovated as it looked."
18111,1895122,5,Javi13,16/05/2022,"It can be a bit expensive, but you pay for what you get: bathroom cleaning every 2 hours, flat pitches, endless shade, own beach, attentive and polite staff. Being built on terraces you always have a view, a really good restaurant. Impossible to have more. As soon as they open they have us there every weekend."
18111,1856625,1,guadamirmaffini,27/04/2022,Today it is closed and on Google it says open. Terrible service
18111,1821554,1,ZaphodBeebleBrox74,14/04/2022,"Unfortunately closed. Beautifully located campsite, what a pity."
18111,1589128,3,LauFerIru,18/09/2021,"We have spent the night on the 16th, free camping camping, good service. We were able to choose a plot. Gray and black water drainage service. Cost AC 2 p light = 34.55.- the dog does not pay, thank you for admitting pets. Clean place, rubbish bins do not have a recycling distinction, we trust that they have an internal recycling management since the environment they have is privileged and must be taken care of"
18111,1576177,5,familiekugelschreiberchen,13/09/2021,Incredibly beautiful campsite on the Atlantic! The places are large and some have a breathtaking view of the sea. Staff very nice. There is a small supermarket with the essentials at a fair price. There are good paths from the square to different beaches where everyone can enchant with their beauty :)
18111,1568898,5,maikellin,11/09/2021,Magnificent camping. 100% recommended stunning views. Fabulous price and place. With direct access to the beach we were 2 very quiet days. We had dinner at the camping restaurant and everything was very good. The next day when we left we went to breakfast and a rather unpleasant woman attended to us. It seemed like it wasn't his day ...
18111,1564487,5,Pegasus1905,10/09/2021,"Wonderful place with a perfect view of the sea, good facilities, clean, friendly. Also suitable for large mobiles."
18111,1545539,5,ULTREIA,04/09/2021,"Good camping with spectacular views, a good restaurant with 10 pizzas, and a very good rice, we will repeat."
18111,1535953,5,durendal1936,31/08/2021,"Great campsite with super views, nice beach and nice pool."
18111,1531821,5,nnnikooo,30/08/2021,"Really nice place with free choice of seats and enough places (during the week, according to the reception, there is always a place free). Sanitary facilities are also completely ok. 5 stars for the view, as almost all seats offer an unobstructed view of the sea! In addition, a beautiful beach, small shop ... The restaurant is a bit overpriced, quality but also really ok"
18111,1531572,4,RC45,30/08/2021,"If we were able to function without regulations, it would not be a problem if the plots are not delimited ,,. good facilities, well for AC ,. In short, good camping, better to avoid long bridges. cleanliness, a 10."
18111,1519157,5,josueps,27/08/2021,"Camping Las Arenas in El Pechón. Direct access to the beach with some stone and something rough at some point but at ease having it right there. An unsupervised beach where people also go with their dogs despite having an old forbidden sign. Great big pool to enjoy. Bar / restaurant and shop. Walks to walk by nature. Areas without parceling, you line where you want in many places with sea views. Very clean bathrooms. 30 th day 2 people and van without light. Free pets."
18111,1518643,5,iferrero,27/08/2021,"We confirm the rest of the comments. Price according to services and cleaning. Very beautiful Pedreru beach next door. Walk to the village. Huge campsite without bungalows or residents, very nice atmosphere."
18111,1514646,4,LaBichaneta,26/08/2021,"Huge campsite with almost all services, with beautiful views of the sea or forest area. Easy access filling and emptying. The cleaning of the bathrooms is almost continuous. It is not parceled out, but knowing how to position yourself and being civic, they neither bother you nor bother you. Discount if you are a health worker and report it by leaving your phone number at the entrance in case your help is needed."
18111,1511515,4,Azurmendi,25/08/2021,"Charming campsite, spectacular views, if you are looking for ideal tranquility. The cleaning is continuous and of 10. The only downside for me is that it is not parceled out, you place yourself where you can, others will find it an advantage. € 80 2 days in August, 2 people, caravan, car and electricity."
18111,1489900,2,EM15,21/08/2021,"In high season a chaos, if you are careless they camp you at the door of the motorhome, it is a pity that we are not able to function without rules. Campsite with the best views so far, it hurts that they don't park it up. The masks are not used in the bathrooms or in the sink area despite the Covid."
18111,1480624,5,WillyGavilan,19/08/2021,"Very large and spacious campsite. excellent services. Great water change area and there is usually no queue. multitude of pitches on several levels, with views of the sea or the groves. The restaurant has some very fresh fish, medium high price (It is not a camping price). Better to enter in the morning to take a good plot. In the afternoon you will also find a plot in high season. Your own beach."
18111,1478414,1,jardinetbcn,18/08/2021,"We have been on 08/17/21 and it is chaos, the supermarket triples prices, messy camping where you have to look for life to find a place, when you get it you must protect your area so that other campers do not invade you. Mostly young people wanting to party. The good thing is the pechon beach that is right next to it. The cachopo restaurant was good."
18111,1464833,5,coquerelfamily,16/08/2021,"Facing the ocean. Great campsite, huge, very clean, very welcoming, no booking necessary. first come are first served. We spent 2 quiet nights there and took advantage of the beach to surf."
18111,1449155,5,goyini,13/08/2021,"Beautiful campsite next to the sea, super clean bathrooms and showers with hot water, supermarket and swimming pool. 100% recommended without delimited pitches, you enter and settle wherever you want."
18111,1442166,5,Franducati,11/08/2021,"It's amazing. Full, but having no delimitation of the plots and it is so large you find a place that is cool for you. Bring theme for mosquitoes…."
18111,1441996,5,maria_ga1,11/08/2021,"We loved it, clean, big. The supermarket a bit expensive. spectacular views. Great to go with young children"
18111,1421133,5,pondersvan,08/08/2021,"Spectacular site, clean and maintained to the maximum, we had problems with the dryer and they fixed it. Free camping. Highly recommended for a couple nights."
18111,1420466,3,Nieps,07/08/2021,"You choose the plot you, we without vitas because we wanted to sleep flat. 2 nights, 2 adults, 1 child and electricity € 83 you pay for the views and cleaning, of course. Access to the chulisima stone beach. One downside, the staff moves in A quad that is very annoying if you are in a central plot because it happens very often and watch out if it rains a lot because the grass creates a muddy area that the van got stuck"
18111,1403428,4,Sergionoja,04/08/2021,"Highly recommended campsite, attention at the reception of 10. You can choose a plot with or without sea views. The bathrooms are spotless and the cleaning staff is constant. Flat and sloping areas. To put a downside, the noise of the waves crashing can be annoying if you are a light sleeper, but it is easily solved by putting yourself in a more remote plot. Very new swimming pool."
18111,1396241,5,kty31,02/08/2021,Exceptional campsite. In peaceful nature with a breathtaking view of the sea. Free choice of pitches. The sanitary facilities are spotlessly clean. Cleaning throughout the day. A very good memory.
18111,1370688,5,olayagm,27/07/2021,"The best campsite in a long time! It is not cheap but it is worth it. There are no plots, but it is very large. Pool and beach could not ask for more ... well yes, a little sun."

As it hits, many hills to move with the motorhome and there is no possibility of recycling garbage. Great rest."
18111,1347473,5,camper_308,21/07/2021,We went back to this spectacular campsite and without a doubt the cleaning etc is still very good
18111,1344689,5,Swiftz,20/07/2021,Huge parkland with large demarcation plots. Sea views to private stoney beach to surf. Restaurant not recommend but does have great views to Tina Major gorge down a steep path below. Toilet showers are spotless. Lovely field walk to nearest town Pechon and 4 restaurants. Loved it and we will be back.
18111,1341885,5,cowboy25,19/07/2021,Large campsite with always a lot of free spots. The first arrivals the best seats! But there is plenty to do.

18111,1314226,1,tsunamisport,11/07/2021,"€ 30 a night 2 people and a Camper, very expensive so that later they tell you that you have to leave before 12: 00h"
18111,1300725,2,nanedvr,06/07/2021,Mosquitoes riddled us and lots of flies! We had to change places and even get inside the motorhome ... that is if the views were impressive! A place to disconnect .... high price.
18111,1253568,5,camper_308,13/06/2021,"We spent this weekend here and my god what a place ... breathtaking views a campsite with cleaning services, attention, it does not have delimited pitches and some are narrow, a restaurant at the entrance not recommended, expensive and battle food. we pay for sleeper car and 2 adults without electricity 29.85 per night"
18111,1238403,2,karin7300,05/06/2021,"Great location. Unfortunately the pool was closed and the shop half empty, and sometimes closed during the stated opening hours. The worst was that on departure we had to pay more than €40 more than indicated in advance. The beach is beautiful."

18111,943075,4,jagomsah,09/08/2020,"Great !!!! Location, views, plots (widely distributed and untidy), staff at the campsite, supermarket and bathrooms. On the contrary, reception staff not friendly (better to put machines) and the unbounded plots makes in July / August somewhat complicated (people occupying a lot of space)"
18111,920999,3,Invisibles,02/08/2020,"Excellent location, direct access to the beach and beautiful wooded trails. A pity that the reception staff who attended us were not very pleasant and wanted to cut our electricity supply before departure. Only one member of staff made an effort to make things easier for us."
18111,905211,4,tafire,28/07/2020,"Good camping. the only thing that I see a little expensive. two adults 8 euros. child 7 euros. camper 14 total € 37 per night I see it excessive. That is if the short-haired woman from the super edge reception, with bad manners. since this to the public could have a better face. Otherwise well. At the end of everything there is a path that takes you to other beaches within a couple of kms on foot. it is very worth it. very very pretty."

18111,622533,1,pequenos,12/08/2019,"As already stated in a previous comment, the Reception does not limit the number of arrivals. So as there are no delimited plots, this in high season is chaos and space is not used. Come with our 7 m ac where we have managed to park it is at the entrance of the campsite ..... which is like parking on the street."
18111,588864,5,Marian2488,31/07/2019,"A campsite with incredible views, do you wear wherever you want and with easy access to the beach with beautiful caves? There are many slopes to move around the campsite but it is worth it"

Camping with beautiful view, installation and services correct, but quite expensive (60 € approx with a tent, a van, 3 children and 2 adults). To flee because one could accept the situation, except that there is no limitation of location, the campers pile up and at the reception they do not limit the numbers of arrivals. The horror! What ruin everything! Bad policy."

18112,3070963,4,MGViajar,03/08/2023,"Great place to spend a day at the beach. All the services, the AC plots are uneven but with chocks it is solved. Beach 200 meters away, you can hear the waves and feel the sea breeze. All services in good condition, the faucet is threaded and you have to bring the adapter, but it's not a problem. The pity is that they only leave 24 hours. Great site! Beach bar nearby."

Generous parking spaces for vehicles over 8m - however, the areas are sloping and only a few spaces can be used without leveling wedges. Sandy beach in a short distance. quiet at night. Illuminated. Water pressure low and usable with one trigger. The baker comes by in the morning. Many thanks to the community for this free space."

Guardia civil did a tour around the parking area tonight at about 7pm but they did not stop to talk. a few fishermen went down to the beach at dusk. just the sound of the wind and the waves to send you to sleep.

18112,2411518,5,TFourNight,29/09/2022,"Super nice pitch with a great beach. Beach shower was already switched off. Very quiet, since there was so little going on, we were able to stand at the actual car parking lot without wedges! Recommendation!"
18112,2410867,4,HeKl,29/09/2022,Nice place on the beach. Out of season toilet and beach cafe is closed. Cold water shower operating on the beach?. Ideal for walks along the coast or for surfing in the wild Atlantic. We enjoyed it very much.
18112,2407642,4,etienne,27/09/2022,"Very nice motorhome area, close to the magnificent beach. we spent 2 nights there without any problem. a big thank you to this municipality."
18112,2381451,4,cecilem33,18/09/2022,Easy access. There is a grass car park on the left just before arriving at the area with a view of the sea. Ideal for landing at night and surfing at dawn. Shower on the way to the beach and drinking water. Peaceful place mid September.
18112,2335907,5,mason2399,03/09/2022,"Great find, close to a surfers beach. Sadly dogs are not allowed on the beach."
18112,2331285,5,Didacanis,02/09/2022,"Idyllic beach, and the area with all the services, including that the baker stops by to be able to buy breakfast. The toilets are only open in the afternoon. Too bad you can't take out tables and chairs because the place supports you to do that. It would need to have a view of the sea to be perfect."
18112,2322799,5,jaimemesa,30/08/2022,"Very nice beach between mountains, to surf it works with the tide rising, from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. and around 7:00 p.m."

18112,2291230,5,aritxu,23/08/2022,"We have spent a couple of days although there is a sign prohibiting staying overnight for more than one night. On good days it fills up with cars to go to the beach, which is 200 meters away, but there is plenty of room. The car parks above are uneven, chocks are needed. To sleep a very quiet place and in the morning the baker passes by."
18112,2268731,4,oxi79,19/08/2022,Really nice place. Lots of space and nice location. Nice bar and great beach. services available. Only the uncompromising (compulsory leash as an alternative?) ban on dogs on the beach is annoying.
18112,2268237,5,Gregorianski2,19/08/2022,"Amazing! Plenty of space, calm and not overcrowded. Next to a wonderful surfing beach. We ended up here by chance and it's one of the best places we have slept in."

18112,2248707,5,vieuxjames,16/08/2022,I stopped there for emptying and refilling with clean water. The euro-relay terminal is functional. The push button lasts a long time with a good flow. There is room to manoeuvre.

18112,2169813,5,SilviaM333,03/08/2022,Great place. Accessible to all vehicles. The top of the car park is tilted but on the bottom no problem. We spent 1 quiet night there. The beach is 300m away and you can go surfing there. Many walk departures are possible. I recommend.

There is a bar a little higher. Be sure to dispose of food in garbage containers because animals such as foxes use open garbage cans. Please respect cleanliness and surroundings."
18112,2130643,5,SipsParritta,27/07/2022,A brutal natural scene. Good place to learn to surf. The most important thing: the baker comes around 10am

18112,1736193,5,Prorom,17/01/2022,"One of the best free courses in northern Spain. Location directly behind the fine sandy beach, well-known surf spot. Shops nearby, very quiet. Terrain slightly sloping, gravel. Unfortunately only 1 night allowed. We will be back!"
18112,1676827,5,povilas393,03/11/2021,Came here to visit Beach. Did not spend night because it is very sloping parking but probably you could have quite night sleep.
18112,1647138,4,viajantesontheroad,16/10/2021,"Quiet location close to the beach with access to water services. Shower on the beach. The only downside is the parking lot is a bit sloping, which does not prevent you from sleeping well, but to be specified."
18112,1645968,5,MuSchnu9,15/10/2021,"Parking lot with super ent and supply. And boards with hiking and shopping opportunities. Excellent! As a thank you to the community, we put the overflowing rubbish in and around the rubbish bins at the picnic tables into the garbage and glass containers available at the site. It's a shame that there are people who express their low appreciation for the beautiful nature and environment."
18112,1633025,4,madeesse,08/10/2021,Large parking lot where it is possible to stay 24 hours. Drainage and water available. Calm. Very good to go to the beach 300 meters away.
18112,1620128,5,Regina65,01/10/2021,"Very, very nice parking space with free supply and disposal. It is a pity that some are so inconsiderate and leave the camper running for hours to recharge the battery."
18112,1581839,5,aras1234,15/09/2021,"Excellent conditions and location, good demarcation of spaces, unfortunately a group of transformed cars, instead of occupying specific places to park, parked on the grass next to the garden tables, preventing others from using the tables and making the wrong use of the conditions"
18112,1572877,5,vsabel,12/09/2021,"Super quiet area, we arrived Friday afternoon, we did the night and beach the next day. Thanks to the Xove Council for having such an ASA. Criticism: Vans, foreign surfers Campers set up mini-camps, not very showy of course and other colleagues from AC take out tables and chairs to eat. That we limit more and more space depends on us. We will regret"
18112,1561589,5,Bikerhd,09/09/2021,"Large area with about 30 very spacious places, side slope, with wooden tables, free water refueling point and waste disposal. 200 m from the beach after a dune, very good area"
18112,1554752,5,cmcampervan,07/09/2021,"We arrived at night and we spent it and a little further on there is another parking lot that must be the one on the beach, we turned around and parked it was quite empty, the night was very quiet and pleasant"
18112,1554606,5,klauscamper,07/09/2021,Two decades stopping by this beach ... congratulations to the area ...
18112,1536476,5,MandyMarcus,01/09/2021,"5 stars or more. Very quiet place, with everything you need. Even if some places are sloping, it doesn't matter what you are offered for. Please do not do your business in nature or throw paper away. There are also ""separation toilets"" for small vans. If we continue to treat our environment in this way, these places will no longer exist. Portugal has already reacted !!"
18112,1494121,5,japawlik,21/08/2021,"Beautiful place. Amazing beach, amazing trails around. This camper park is very nice, with new service station, all free. Highly recommended."

18112,1480752,4,AmparoCCz,19/08/2021,Quiet overnight. Somewhat sloping ground parking. Toilets and outdoor showers at the beach entrance. Quiet surf beach and not very crowded. Services for ACs at the end of the parking lot.
18112,1480739,5,AmparoCCz,19/08/2021,The Area is 10. Easy to take water and change gray and black. Clean and spacious. Thanks to the Council of Xove !!!
18112,1465211,5,Miranda05,16/08/2021,"The place is great, by the beach and close to some trails. It's on an incline place.
The only thing that annoys me is the ignorance of some people who park on the grass despite many places available, only to take those few picnic tables that are for everyone to share. Respect the nature, respect others."
18112,1454826,5,Rafikis,14/08/2021,"The site is spectacular for a stopover, even to stay a couple of days. The beach is beautiful and the area is magnificent. Go provisioned because nearby there is only a beach bar. The only but is that the road from Viveiro is somewhat complicated ... for the return, we prefer to leave the town in the direction of Xove than to meet all the cars that came from Viveiro"
18112,1449247,5,Sthephany27,13/08/2021,"We spent a night with the van and everything was great, most of the squares are uneven, but the first ones are level. It has bathrooms nearby, but the hours are quite limited. many squares"
18112,1439637,5,Nines_9,11/08/2021,"Good area with free filling and emptying service (gray and black), garbage cans. It has tables with wooden benches and wastebaskets. 5 minutes walk from the beach, (with showers) along a path that leaves from the area. Very quiet night. I wish there were more areas like this, even with the unevenness."
18112,1419570,3,Daviperez,07/08/2021,Area with emptying and filling. It has a path that takes you to the beach. The squares are not level.
18112,1401788,5,dekapax,04/08/2021,"The area with all the services is a bit inclined but it can be worn full of vans who take out everything and tend their suits but do not say anything, so benches and stone tables must be allowed, a very close beach bar and fabulous beach"
18112,1377247,5,park4nightnoelia,29/07/2021,"Quiet place, very nice. You fall asleep with the noise of Del Mar. All services. Very good views."
18112,1366344,4,Kuffner,26/07/2021,"Very complete area with filling and emptying services. Some squares are very inclined. They all need chocks to level. The site and the beach are spectacular. In the morning the baker comes with different breads, buns and empanadas. Bad eye coverage (Orange)"
18112,1358932,5,Javi_Coyanza,24/07/2021,"Area in a pleasant natural environment. Very close to the beach. Last summer baker when he sees vegetables. Ideal beach and fabulous surroundings. The only drawback is the squares on a slope, some considerable. Thank City Council, City Hall and corporations for these initiatives."
18112,1340884,5,ViagensDaquiParaAli,19/07/2021,Great spot to go to the Esteiro beach and do some surfing. Nice and friendly surf bar with nice views just a few minutes by foot. Highly recommended.
18112,1336459,3,calichy,18/07/2021,Quiet area. With marked area for DHW. There are more places. Tables to eat. Very natural environment. Water drainage area. The only drawback is the unevenness. We did not spend the night. Beach two minutes walk.
18112,1305912,5,DominiqueLevallois,08/07/2021,A brand new area as we would like to find in France.
18112,1286820,5,smh654,30/06/2021,Nice camper night parking close to a beautiful beach (beach not visible from parking but 3-5 mi utes away by feet). Toilet at the beach (200 meters away from parking) available but only open from 13:00 to 20:00. There is also a bar nearby but we did not check it. Fresh water available and also picknick tables. Gray water dump station also available. most of the lots are slightly inclined.
18112,1264491,5,HippalLR,19/06/2021,"Wonderful place ! To preserve, be respectful"
18112,1256146,5,crepesauvage,15/06/2021,"Perfect place to spend one or more nights: shower, toilet (3 p.m. to 8 p.m. during the week, 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. on weekends), drinking water, ...). Beautiful surf spot at low and mid tide. Quiet and natural place. Small bar at the top of the beach open seasonally. No dark corner for now, to see in 4/5 years. Enjoy !"
18112,1254672,3,RamonKTF,14/06/2021,"The squares are very uneven in every way. I did not stay overnight. I was expecting something else more in line with the leveling needs of a motorhome. In my opinion, it does not deserve 5 or 4 stars"
18112,1252575,5,valia,13/06/2021,"Nice place, close to the beach great for surfing. Most of the parking spaces are leaning, so be prepared. Next to a road, but with no traffic, we felt very safe. The road leading from Viveiro is not the widest, so meeting a truck could cause a bit of a problem. No shops near (there is a bar next to the other prking, that is probably open in season), just nature."
18112,1227256,5,crispulgar,30/05/2021,"Good area next to a beautiful beach. Highly recommended! We were going from Xove and the navigator diverted us at one point to the left along a very narrow road where luckily we did not meet anyone, but it would have been very fat! We were also afraid of hitting a branch .... When we left we went the other way and nothing to see! Be careful with that!"
18112,1213020,5,Freigeist12,23/05/2021,"Great, very suitable for hiking and water sports."
18112,1182463,5,FuXerxes,30/04/2021,"We stood here for 3 nights very quietly and without any problems. You should be prepared for an incline, but no problem with drive-up wedges. Within 2 minutes you can reach a beach for surfing. The place is new and will be expanded further. We recommend."
18112,1154261,5,Catalega,20/03/2021,"I put five stars even though it is not level (in one sense of the square quite a lot, in the other not) because I believe that we must value the effort of the City Council of Xove in enabling such a large area and with good services. Two minutes if you arrive from the blue flag beach. Watch where the gps sends you, depending on how it gets you on asphalt roads, but roads."
18112,1087276,4,Pirovan,09/10/2020,"Very good place, near the beach with showers and a great place to surf. In October we were 5 vans."
18112,1069384,4,NahirAbrain,25/09/2020,"Good grassy esplanade to park. Quiet surf beach, nearby road with little traffic. At the end of September we were the only van. Showers and source of drinking water. There are bathrooms but with reduced hours, they only open in the afternoons during the week. Recommended although you cannot see the beach from the parking lot it is a few meters away."
18112,1058233,2,faurys93,19/09/2020,"We found the place sad, a large field without any particular charm compared to the places by the sea that we have had so far. We did not stay there (no view of the beach which, yes, is very pretty)."
18112,1046069,5,senshei81,13/09/2020,"Good grass parking, a little inclined but with chocks it is solved. It has no services, but there is a bar next door. We sleep alone. The huge beach is in front. Wooded area to be able to do a route. Access is easy and paved road"
18112,1032589,5,Laverao,07/09/2020,"There are 2 parking spaces, the one at the end is for cars and motorcycles. The first is that of vans and acs. At the beginning of September, I alone. Gc passes every morning, but they don't say anything. Very quiet and beautiful place. Surf beach."

18112,890681,3,Pitt.B.,23/07/2020,"A nice place to stand. Looks like a campsite, all other campers very considerate. Unfortunately we had the bad luck that local youths came to camp, who bawled and were loud until late at night (4 o'clock). So sleeping was hardly possible."
18112,786387,4,Hettie97,25/02/2020,"This is a lovely place, not near anything so nice to just enjoy the scenery. Clear blue water and eucalyptus trees everywhere. In winter there is quite a lot of fog and cloud here as it is in a valley  when it is sunny in the town just before! Toilets closed in winter. Tap and cold beach shower still on however"
18112,779583,5,Maggiethegreenvan,12/02/2020,"Magnificent place to stay. In Feb it was just me and one other van. a few people passed by for walks or checking the surf but it was so quite over all. spent 2 nights here, beach was unbelievable and they weather was amazing.

It is very safe, walking is 15 minutes from the cathedral and there is a bus (line 1) that takes you to the city center. Without a doubt, the safest and most comfortable car park in Santiago. It is not noisy, it is quiet and it has many services nearby (24 hour gas station with a supermarket for example)"

If not, go spend the night at the museum outside the city. It's free and you're calmer. Compostela is hell to go by motorhome. They don't let you park in the whole city and they fine you if you do.

Pool is open from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m. What I found disturbing were the barking dogs at night (not on the pitch, but in the surrounding area) as well as the planes landing from Madrid in the morning (the pitch is directly in the approach path)."

A stone's throw from La Coruña. 15/20 minutes from the seaside on foot, with café terraces facing La Coruña. Too bad that in the vicinity of the dogs (the evil of the century) yelp all night."
18175,2906316,4,domiheyLA,29/06/2023,"In principle this campsite deserves 5 stars. Unfortunately I have to deduct 1 star because of the above average amount of barking dogs during the night. If you are sensitive to noise like me, it is unbearable."
18175,2898399,5,Theurer-LutzAngelika,27/06/2023,Very nice for a place near the city. 12 km to A Coruna. Ideal for visiting the city. Very nice with the park atmosphere and the sculptures. Everything perfect all around.
18175,2824398,5,BduS,05/06/2023,"Spaciously set up as a landscape park with various statues. Not suitable for motorhomes >7.5m. Pitches are spacious, shaded and reasonably level. Sanitary facilities are good and clean. Air traffic is noticeable but did not bother us. There is a mini shop. The larger supermarket is about 800 meters away. The gray water is somewhat impractical due to its location. Cycling to A Coruña is fun and requires a good condition."
18175,2817626,5,PeterRueti,04/06/2023,"Very nice campsite. Park-like facility with some sculptures. Good restaurant. Nice personel. At night, the customary barking of dogs is annoying. Ear plugs help."

18175,1616383,5,Annaeae,29/09/2021,"Very comfortable site. Friendly staff. Super nice garden and greens. very nice place with nice staff, great green area with a few sculptures.

18175,1586481,1,Pegasus1905,17/09/2021,"Steep and narrow access and driveway. If you can do this with a motorhome that is longer than 7 m, you are a veritable world champion. One of three impossible places in the RV-hostile city of A Coruna."

What is missing is a children's park is for my two little ones;) We will spend two nights !!!!"

18175,708860,4,craigsteph1962,30/09/2019,Lovely spot that feels like you are in a forest. Very clean. Tight spaces with trees and posts so not the simplest to park in with a 7mt van and overhang. Quiet apart from village dogs barking every 10 minutes not good for light sleepers. NB is not 800 meters from centre of A Corona but quite near local town.
18175,653136,5,Nadstrip,23/08/2019,"Perfect: pleasant camping, good reception and French. Sanitary always clean, big pitches and nice pool!"
18175,644143,5,2che-Phil,19/08/2019,"Perfect. Large tree sites, all sanitary is topical and very clean. Access not easy to negotiate with a motorhome with a significant rear overhang, in which case, I will advise to access the campsite by going up the Avenue d'Est to the West."

18175,104849,3,valex51,12/09/2016,"Confirmation of previous comments but it should be noted that access is by a single lane very steep. For the exit impossible to gain momentum, very penalizing for the big motorhome and even more if vehicles with trailer. In addition, if another vehicle shows up in the downhill not obvious to restart without tiring the mechanics."
18175,82125,5,poupeyou,16/07/2016,"Very good reception, very clean campsite, services for refueling motorhomes, all local services, shaded pitches, super good restaurant at the entrance of the campsite, well located for the visit of the Coruna, I recommend."

18182,1464629,4,Beyotu,16/08/2021,"Nice place to spend the night, it has what you need: discharge of gray water and filled with clean water (the tap is pressure); flat terrain (leftover in the morning, sun in the afternoon); near the town and the natural pool, which is very well prepared, but not pet friendly. We went to have breakfast in the town square, where we had some delicious tomato toast in the CARPE DIEM bar."
18182,1277099,4,pericana,25/06/2021,"Quiet and recommended easy place to load water and unload the only downside is that the last section is not in the GPS and it can get you inside the town and complicate the arrival if you go by motorhome, follow the signs and pass the GPS when you arrive at the town"

18182,1152062,5,oviedo666,15/03/2021,"Highly recommended site. Quiet place, with tables, drained gray and black water and filled with free water. Shortly after we arrived, M.Jesús came, the town guide, told us that there was a company that brought pizzas to the area and the next day he made us a very pleasant tourist visit of the town. We were very pleasantly surprised, we will see its natural pool and its living nativity scene again."
18182,1118826,5,Peperojas,02/12/2020,Very good place to relax

18182,810965,5,Manucc,28/05/2020,"Easy access from the road that goes around the town, a leveled platform that facilitates the operation of loading and unloading water, a push-button tap that can give you some trouble loading water, thanks to Torre de don Miguel for this area."

18182,581734,4,Toyotomi,28/07/2019,Easy access platform for water change. You should have one outlet for filling the clean water and another for cleaning the toilet (there is only one). It is appreciated this well located area to visit the Sierra de Gata.
18182,523832,5,basata,21/06/2019,"The place is perfect. Man stands on grass between big poplars. The place marked here only the service station. The actual parking space is a bit higher, indicated in the map as a parking lot. So, watch out. Take care of the car and spend 80 meters uphill on the pretty parking space for Autocaravanas. We found it very nice here!"
18182,438495,5,Benitocasti,10/03/2019,"Comfortable, silent and well maintained. It has picnic tables. Strategic site to visit Sierra de Gata."

18182,130661,4,Josele2,24/04/2017,"Perfect area to empty and fill, very quiet for overnight and with plenty of space to park right next to the area or a little above the trees. Everything has a little inclination but putting the chocks solves the problem."
18182,116583,1,jupersan,24/12/2016,Very bad place just to empty and fill there are no spaces and the little that there is inclined
18182,115527,4,cgmacher,06/12/2016,The actual parking space (signposted) is but a few meters further north between the row of trees and opposite the row houses.

18182,82155,5,joaquinmorenoti,16/07/2016,"One of the areas that I visited this month of July 2016, from there we have traveled on our motorcycle throughout the region of Sierra de Gata, a very comfortable area with water and gray water collection and WC, about 300 meters there is one the best natural pools, where there are also very clean and free toilets, in addition the Chiringuito has Las Cañas at a Euro and serves some Burgers for 4.50 Euros. Also, in this place you can visit the famous Water Mills with Wheels Giants, the Town deserves a visit for its streets It has a typical architecture of this area worthy of note. I recommend this place we were great, we will return whenever we can to visit this area."

18196,3281585,3,josianesouchon,10/09/2023,"A large parking lot is a wasteland, a little sloping but which leaves a nice view of the sea. Nice walk to the tower to see the sunset. A Spar next to restaurants bars and beach across the street. some French CCs stay there for several weeks. Too bad they dump their gray water there thinking they'll make the plants grow. lamentable. 1 or 2 nights. No more."

Park upstairs so as not to take over the parking lot below and above all not to dirty or go around releasing liquids that there is a lot of this profile of ""caravanists"". Then we want them to respect us and we demand parking lots. Well, respect this one. Thank you"
18196,2976100,5,Traf74,17/07/2023,"One of our favorite spots! Located next to the sea, with a magnificent view and a great sunset! Night with air and calm.

18196,2627419,5,Ceej271,27/03/2023,"One of the best spots we've found in Spain, we parked right up the top, huge open space (enough to have our own little garden). So peaceful, nice climbs up the cliff to watch the magical sunset and 2mins walk from the beach! No signs prohibiting overnight, ignore comments about the police, the place is marked on Google as campervan parking and is used as such day and night."
18196,2616931,4,karyon,20/03/2023,"Super huge parking space. We didn't have any problems with the police, as some write. A quiet night. Right next to a small Spar convenience store, open even in the off-season. A few steps to the beach. It's a shame that there is no after-sales service. Only containers are here. A lot of the accommodation here is out of season, so you won't be alone here."

18196,2577336,5,Maetthy,14/02/2023,"If you love freedom, this is the place for you. You stand here on a large gravel site (with no facilities except for rubbish bins) overlooking the sea."
18196,2571862,1,Josesusi30,08/02/2023,The people don't respect anything. It seems like a police camp that doesn't do anything.
18196,2568845,1,Gilles71,05/02/2023,"The typical example of what not to do! A wasteland with an impressive amount of motorhomes! Trailer, car, deck chair, washing line... Everyone squats as much as possible without leaving room for the other! The coast is so beautiful, go your way!"

18196,2523381,4,dieffe,17/12/2022,The place is full today. The seats in the upper area have a fantastic view. Disposal is possible at the BP gas station 8 km away. The new pitch at Mercadona is even better: about 10 km. Please NEVER simply dispose of the gray water on site. There was already trouble yesterday!!!
18196,2519899,4,7g7g,11/12/2022,I have visited here for the past 5 years. today 80 vans. most staying a few days. sadly a few setting up home with outside areas even kennels! cleaner than previous years and entrance easier to access.

18196,2517161,1,simonauta,09/12/2022,"It is a great place to spend the day and spend the night (in summer there is no shade). Do not throw your garbage on the ground, there are containers! It is not allowed to use chocks or stabilizer bars, or throw gray or black water, or remove an awning, or remove chairs and tables, or use a kitchen on the street. It is not a campsite or a motorhome area with services, it is just a parking lot! Shame. they will shut it down for this"
18196,2516875,5,juanangelnavarro,08/12/2022,"Good place without any type of electricity, water, shower service, but beautiful views near the beach and supermarkets, you have to search a bit for a flat place if you do not want to put chocks"
18196,2513874,4,andreasliebe,05/12/2022,"Nice place with a great view of the bay and the sea. But you need wedges almost everywhere to stand up straight. There are currently around 40 mobile homes there. Couldn't find any litter and dirt except for dog poo from unwary owners. Lots of flies when there is little wind but the great view makes up for it. Separate waste bins for glass, plastic, paper and residual waste are available."
18196,2503970,5,Rosaliveros,23/11/2022,"I've only been walking along the boardwalk, and he's on it. There are many campervans (perhaps 20 or more) and room for many more. It looks very good, next to a super Spar, although it was closed at 7pm. At this time there are campers in a thousand places here, and there are no prohibition signs. A great pleasure, we just have to take care of the environment."

I spent 2 nights there feeling very good. I recommend without hesitation.

We felt really safe, few meters away there is a groceries shop.
Highly recommendable."

Huge car park but beach on the very narrow sandy part, and even more so in the evening when the sea rises! I dare not imagine in season or on weekends!!"
18196,2391026,4,jAPONEs,21/09/2022,"For me it is a paradise. I come every year and spend 8 or 10 days on these dates. I PARK, I DON'T CAMP. It is a privilege to be able to enjoy our mobile homes in this place, but the neighbors do not like to see us with awnings and tables outside. Please, in order to continue enjoying this place for a few more years, DO NOT CAMP. Thanks."
18196,2367047,5,viveloscolores,13/09/2022,"Great place in the month of September, quiet and on the beachfront. The beach is ideal for children since it does not cover for meters, crystal clear waters and ideal for snorkeling in some areas. Small supermarket right next door. It does not have showers but it does have to wash your feet and be able to get some water there. Great esplanade. Not camping! overnight without problems."
18196,2258747,5,Cartageneros,18/08/2022,"Good site if respected, near the beach and services. Refrain from being uncivil and respecting the rules, we will have this place year after year."

18196,2190900,3,TelleriaEli,07/08/2022,"3 stars for location. Pass the road and to the beach. The parking lot is very large. A supermarket next door. We visited the Bateria de Castillitos but it cannot be accessed by motorhome. You have to get there by car, on foot or by taxi. A pity that Cartagena does not exploit this place by adapting it with guided tours and services in conditions."
18196,2170776,1,choquito,04/08/2022,"Another year that I come and here every year the people are more unpresentable. Throwing gray water (to know what else, my guess is reflection), the smaller the caravan, the more deployment of means: awnings, chairs, tables, etc. and with two .... on the front line Really. They even make you want to call the Civil Guard yourself. No wonder the locals are up to their noses with people like that"
18196,2144652,5,Dams09300,30/07/2022,Large car park. Lots of motorhomes. Sloping floor depending on the places. Quiet night. Nice view.

18196,1851223,5,3pleL,24/04/2022,The big dirt parking lot is obviously popular with campers of all sizes. A friendly and safe atmosphere. Police came and told those who were camping (chairs out or using wedges) to stop as only parking is allowed. Great family climbing possibility up the hill. Rather expensive restaurant with mediocre food down the parking lot.
18196,1823154,5,nuria270,15/04/2022,"It is true that it is an open field, sloping in some parts, of land... but it is right on the beach, with a supermarket, restaurants, places to climb... ideal to come with children. Quiet at night. Free. What more could you want?"

18196,1762777,3,hdavis248,22/02/2022,"Large parking lot, dusty and hard to find a level place when busy. We stayed for 2 nights, some motorhome owners almost started a fight with another MoHo owner when he dared to park near them. Would ignore review before mine, user has only reviewed 3 spots in this area as 1 star, don't think Police would move you on from this parking place at all."
18196,1762029,1,gohome,21/02/2022,police made us leave. locals don’t want us here

18196,1749563,3,CINZIAontheROAD,07/02/2022,"Immense terraced area in clay. With the exception of the first row (view of the garbage bins), it is mandatory to level the vehicle. Restaurants and baskets nearby. Beautiful seafront. A bit of noise from restaurant customers and the unloading of the glass in the bins. I recommend parking further down the street, under the tower."

18196,1741078,2,S13,25/01/2022,"The view of the sea is nice, sunsets are great too. However, terrain is sloping and some people treat the place as their own private property. Quiet at night, but not so during the day."
18196,1740626,5,wideglide298,24/01/2022,"Super place very spacious. There is enough space for everyone, even with a trailer. Right next door is a top restaurant with good food. The course is sloping and wedges are very beneficial. What worries me is the disposal. I've seen people empty their toilets down a gully on the street. They opened a manhole cover and emptied their feces there. We have no understanding for that"
18196,1740290,2,EdGer,24/01/2022,"Terrible place! Too many XXL campers. Too many campers with entitlement to ""their"" place. Take up too much space for camping chairs, additional cars and trailers. Are aggressive if you want to get close to them and they can no longer see the sea. Too many egoists! We fled after one night."

Close to the beach, no noise and a SPAR at 200m."
18196,1584515,5,MatthieuG,16/09/2021,"One of our best place! Indeed there are a lot of camper vans (40 on weekends and around 20 during the week in September) we parked on the heights of the car park, in order to be a little out of the way. The parking lot is really big. The beach is beautiful and a stone's throw away. there is a SPAR, bars / restaurants and garbage cans. The seafront is landscaped and pleasant for strolling."

18196,1488439,4,christiancastro,20/08/2021,"The place is well attended, if you do it skillfully you can stand up straight without wedges. The fine sandy beach is not too big and is now very crowded in August, it is ideal for children because it goes very shallowly into the sea for a long time, the water is clear and pleasantly warm. At some point there will probably be a prohibition sign here too, because some campers do not know what is proper."
18196,1487638,1,choquito,20/08/2021,I am not going to say anything about the site because there is already a lot written but I am going to complain about how uncivil people are.

No wonder they don't love us
18196,1479224,5,Roggomufin,18/08/2021,"Wonder of the site. Parking without prohibitions, the beach across a small road, ideal for snorkelling. We were there about ten days ago and today, on the way back from our route, we repeat."

18196,73630,4,claudecpx,17/05/2016,"Nice pity that there are camper vans cupping for months. A French motorhome of 33, draining gray water in the parking lot and that's how we will be banned again. There is a manhole in the street next door and you can quietly empty your k7 and sewage in the evening around 2am. So make an effort of cleanliness and discretion."
18196,65201,3,chrisoverseas,11/03/2016,"Perfect for a short winter break. A lot of walking to do, and restaurants nearby. // Nice area for a short winter break. Plenty of walking and restaurants nearby."

18196,50626,3,gon943,19/08/2015,"I just arrived and we were to pass, at the moment one night, it is an esplanade with fat gravel and something dusty there is about 10 AC. the site is not bad, about 400 m. of the beach. There is no shadow There are chiringuitos and nearby restaurants and walk. Quiet site without crowds. It is advisable to leave the AC on the last esplanade farthest from the beach and leave the first to the locals. The ACs are seen from the promenade and the beach since they are at the top of the esplanade."
18196,48337,5,luthi,12/08/2015,"We arrived on 06/08/15, we are 12 and we are still so much we are fine there. Very good locations. There is a beautiful beach, a grocery store and even a toilet on the beach."

18197,3247731,5,Flokaka,01/09/2023,"Ideal for visiting the Bardenas, we arrived from Portugal at 10 p.m. The area is almost empty, 4 or 5 CC max. It will be great for spending the night. Large tarmac parking lot, long and wide spaces, my trailer does not protrude."

18197,2714919,4,Larrainenea,01/05/2023,"A very quiet place at the gates of the bardenas. we were at least 100 motorhomes. If it is a weekend it is convenient to go during the day, to be able to park well and put chocks on since there is a bit of a slope."
18197,2702122,4,lafamillebitou,27/04/2023,"Very quiet spot with the only company of small rabbits. We were alone. It remains a large car park without charm, but the view is beautiful and the night quiet."

18197,2611034,4,walsch,16/03/2023,"a bit lonely place, now in mid-March, but absolutely quiet. In strong winds it will be a bit difficult. Cellular is good."
18197,2606427,5,KikmasterStealth,12/03/2023,Lots of space. Much rest. Toilets/washrooms at the park entrance are currently open. Stayed 3 nights with great cycling and walking routes nearby.

Large parking, at night several cars parked without problems in the car area. I pass surveillance car when closing the park. It has rubbish but no emptying area. The park although expensive, beautiful and fun with children. Above there is a viewpoint to the Bardenas. Spectacular sunset."

18197,1847402,4,park4nignt,23/04/2022,"This car park is very large, it is possible to park in places not reserved for motorhomes. View of the snow-capped mountains. And no noise at night. To recommend."
18197,1824405,4,Yosv,15/04/2022,Plenty of room to park and if the camping area is full you can park in any other space. Slightly sloping terrain.
18197,1788835,4,Richardtkd,20/03/2022,"Free parking ideal for visiting the park. In addition, they have allocated the places closest to the access area, when normally they always put us in the most remote areas. You have to put shims, since it is a little uneven. It would be perfect if they offered a service (with its corresponding costs) such as emptying/filling or electricity. Arriving outside opening hours, you park without problem"
18197,1702300,3,Leonhymer,03/12/2021,You will need good shims to be level. Practice
18197,1672253,4,autocaravanlife,31/10/2021,"Perfect for sleeping and going to the park or going to the park and then sleeping. super quiet at night. Sloping terrain, with the chocks fixed. 10 spaces enabled for AC, but you can spend the night in the entire car park, there is plenty of space.

18197,1486243,3,arcachuchis,20/08/2021,"It is simply the Sendaviva car park, without services, but the expectation of the children to wake up and enter the park is worth everything."
18197,1481700,3,Colchoneta,19/08/2021,"Path parking, asphalted and suitable for a quiet night. Laterally uneven (parking on the hillside). There are about 10 places for ACs. It has no service. You can use the park's restrooms while the park is open. Good night after visiting the park. Arrive a couple of hours before the park opens or after it closes (9:00 p.m.)."
18197,1427035,3,Remolin,09/08/2021,"Parking for no other purpose than spending the night to visit the park. It has a lateral unevenness, which makes it necessary to use chocks. Quiet night"

18197,1413373,3,bg_alberto,06/08/2021,"It is not bad to spend the night if you go to the living path, although it is very uneven and you have to wear shoes. It would be great if they put for gray water, black water and drinking water."
18197,1384968,4,yes_224,31/07/2021,"Very convenient parking, especially once you have visited the park, being able to stay put is very practical. Just anticipate because there is no service. The Park is very nice and very varied. Be careful there can be a lot of wind"
18197,1373042,3,snaveau,28/07/2021,"Quiet during the day in July. 8 km trail with magnificent landscapes, some have done it in a motorhome, we did not dare for fear of damaging the vehicle."

18197,1087374,4,jgonsam,09/10/2020,"An ideal place to spend the night before or after seeing the park, the only thing that is quite uneven. If they put light sockets at a decent price, it would be the cane!"
18197,1015734,5,NaiSemgiKing,30/08/2020,A large parking lot to visit the living path ... perhaps there are no containers to serve so many motorhomes. We have been more than 50 on Friday night. Thank you
18197,998024,4,jabelatxu,24/08/2020,Very quiet place.
18197,789135,3,king3tris,01/03/2020,"We have enjoyed a very quiet night in the month of February. We decided on this location after seeing the saturation of the Arguedas motorhome parking, entry point to the Bardenas Reales."
18197,720981,4,Brilisad,14/10/2019,"Large parking without service, we slept very well in October because the motorhome area of the city was crowded and near the cemetery. We were three motorhomes in absolute calm."
18197,707119,4,beni340,28/09/2019,"Very good to see the living trail. At the entrance, reserved for the parking of coaches. Very spacious and easy places to park, tables and chairs left over. The bad side: the steep, the essentials."

18197,632851,5,mercigd,16/08/2019,"We arrived at night to visit the park the next day. We slept very quiet, without noise, very wide spaces. The park is fine to spend the day with the family. Don't miss the raptor and bobsleigh show. Expensive food. You can leave without problems for lunch in your car and you save a peak: an average of € 12 / pax the food menu ""junk"". They don't register bags or anything."
18197,611626,3,Mithos78,09/08/2019,"We slept peacefully, great to visit the park. Missing shadows and if they put some service as gray emptying or for WC, I think it would be a claim for those who travel with the house in tow. Surely having services and being next to many would end up entering the park."
18197,577935,4,RaulEspinosa,26/07/2019,"Ample parking, without services, very quiet allow the maximum overnight 48 hours. Idela to visit the park, open from 11 am to 11 pm in summer. Many activities and many animals, a stop for the little ones recommended."
18197,510258,3,stephanie62,10/06/2019,"Parking slightly sloping, recommended wedges. From the wind at the end of the day until the morning. But it allowed us to cool the camper (hot in the desert) and to sleep cool. We slept well, the wind did not bother us."

18209,3054712,4,nerenaranjito,31/07/2023,"We have spent a quiet night. At the back of the church (on the way to the cemetery) there is room for a van, it seemed more discreet than parking in front of the church."
18209,2858817,5,Nacheca,16/06/2023,"Very good area to spend the night. Flat land, next to a bar. Quiet and semi-shaded area. The church lights stay on at night, but it's far away, it's not annoying!"

18209,1464399,4,MelanieL31,16/08/2021,"We had a very good night's sleep in this very spacious parking lot, where picnics are allowed. We were also able to take out the solar shower.

The water is crystal clear. What rubbish on the floor is surely left by people who have no respect for anything or anyone. We picked them up anyway. I recommend this place! Compulsory pass. I recommend."
18210,3106732,5,jyepes1,09/08/2023,"So this quaint fishermen stop has: low traffic, amazing views, movie-like sunsets, 24/7 toilets (with power), shower (!) and an amazing old timey cafe/bar straight out of a novel (with WiFi)... let's not ruin this magical place!

oh yeah, it's infested with mosquitos at night there was some biker's noise but it's still 5/5 because it would be 6/5 without them"

18210,1249879,4,PinheiroEsteban,12/06/2021,"Very calm and very restful place. Indeed a little bit of wind but it's still very very correct! It's really worth the detour. Extraordinary view of the sunset! We put 4/5 instead of 5/5 because the toilets are beautiful from the outside but unfortunately just from the outside ... the insanitary interior, toilet door removed etc. I recommend !"
18210,845274,4,PauloMozBarbosa,02/07/2020,Quiet place with a beautiful view of the Ria de Aveiro. Right in front of Torreira (on the other side of the Ria).

18230,1193195,5,Frankieee,12/05/2021,"Perfect. Many places not directly facing the sea, but also some places nearer beach. Looks like Germans occupied it all over :)."
18230,1130699,2,masoze,15/01/2021,With a small vehicle you can even stand relatively quietly on the goat meadow in the off-season. The regular herb and plastic waste incineration is immensely disturbing!
18230,1034944,5,Nurieta22,08/09/2020,"Canine beach of Cobaticos. Ideal place to spend a few quiet days by the sea. It looks like a campsite because it has pitches, almost all taken over by AC and German long-stay caravans with dogs. The beach is very long with gravel and pebbles, when there is the east there are many waves and you can hear the sea a lot, but very pleasant."
18230,780211,3,pascorine,14/02/2020,"Posed facing the sea, we were lucky to see dolphins jump. It is beautiful, parked between the ruins and the sea so as not to crowd in the area on the left when you arrive. Spaniards in a caravan for the only neighbor."

Poisons in greenhouse when we were there. Beautiful view. On fracture line in earthquake area. We left (quietly) after one night. Only rubbish bin at entrance road to beach. Little caravan camp like feeling."

18333,3146653,5,wafl,14/08/2023,"Very great campsite with large pitches and lots of shade. Large pool, small shop and clean sanitary facilities. would we go again Also ideal for a longer period of time."
18333,3127543,5,itasvolleyforever,12/08/2023,"Cozy, new and very clean campsite. We spent two nights here with a motorhome. Large, flat and shaded pitches. Many services including the swimming pool, the restaurant and the supermarket. Located 500 meters from the beaches and 800 meters from the centre. Porto Covo is very pretty and there are beautiful walks. Highly recommended."
18333,3126611,3,juklian,12/08/2023,Very nice home. Pleasant for one night. cleanliness of the entire campsite
18333,3121152,3,GladJu34,11/08/2023,"Impeccable welcome, moderately clean sanitary facilities, beware it is noted ""baby bathroom"" but there is no bathtub for washing babies! 38th for 2 with electricity, pitches on top of each other! we got into a place out of spite stuck in every direction. We advise you to go and see on foot before paying!"
18333,3073169,5,Lupincito2022,04/08/2023,Large and very well-run site with a lively atmosphere and friendly staff. Facilities are constantly cleaned and properly maintained. Demarcated pitches cost 2 euros extra which we think was worth it - we were in section B which felt somewhat more peaceful than other parts. Lovely modern pool. The on-site restaurant is really excellent and good value for the quality. Beaches are nearby.
18333,3054721,4,M.VICTORIA,31/07/2023,"A very nice campsite. large plots, with swimming pool, restaurant. A very pleasant stay to get to know the area, enjoy its beaches and its gastronomy"
18333,3042719,3,Babsi28,29/07/2023,"Nice campsite near the beach. The sanitary facilities are modern and clean, but despite 15 showers in the evening there was a long wait. The beach can be reached in 10 minutes on foot. We were in area E, which was more like a tent camp and there was a lot of noise at night due to constant driving on the site despite the ban."
18333,3012439,4,Jujubebe33,24/07/2023,Beautiful campsite with well-kept grounds. We stood on the large campsite (D). Own parking bays on level C were no longer available. Sanitary facilities very clean and modern. 10 minute walk to the beach and town.
18333,3000059,4,lucaravan,22/07/2023,Very new toilets. Very important in each toilet disinfectant to clean the toilet before using it. Very clean toilets and showers. Only one space to empty dirty water for such a large campsite. Free camping area too far from everything and dark
18333,3000055,3,guayoneta,22/07/2023,"Pros: very careful and beautiful bungalow area, delimited plots and pool. Very close to the Porto Grande beach. Cons: Very expensive. The free camping area is abandoned. In high season it is overcrowded and there is only one shower module, so the queues in the afternoon are impressive and the pool is overcrowded. For the money paid, it is urgent that they put more bathrooms."
18333,2987366,5,vitorSimao,19/07/2023,only cons is the price. I paid €47 a day
18333,2963719,5,Jacksamlondon,14/07/2023,"Nice and organized place,  clean with all the facilities,  not much shadow,  but really recommended"
18333,2956484,4,Smau2k,13/07/2023,"Porto Covo is now super touristy and the place and the prices are aligned: the area is chosen before check-in, the one with a delimited pitch where we stayed costs more than the free one, €34 for 2 in a van, decidedly expensive if, in addition to excellent services, you do not take advantage of the extras including swimming pool with entertainment. Too bad it was impossible to get level in the now chosen place, slept badly."
18333,2953204,5,Girardet,12/07/2023,Very nice campsite located in a pretty little village with pretty beaches nearby. Very pleasant swimming pool and very warm welcome from the young girls. Free pitches at the back of the campsite with lots of shade. I recommend
18333,2923396,3,LaCiKaRu,04/07/2023,"Nice campsite. Pool area is great. A small playground is available. Beautiful beaches and the village are within easy walking distance. The areas E/D have nice shaded areas, but are uneven. The place is quite expensive. In the showers and the sinks (ladies) hair stuck everywhere."
18333,2919384,3,gazalia,03/07/2023,"Pool good- great beaches within walking distance, cute place with various restaurants and small shops. We were in area A-shadows, but full and dense. We had bad luck and a very selfish family behind us, which constantly played loud, terrible music (until evening). Dog barked all day until night. Leave earlier and money back was not possible. Very expensive! 2 adults 2K and camper 47 €"
18333,2890096,5,RoslonTour,25/06/2023,The cleanest and best sanitary facilities we have seen in Portugal. The shady places at A are very pleasant. Perfect location to beaches and town. Everything is well maintained and the staff is very friendly.
18333,2882469,3,elliotdayment,23/06/2023,"The pool outside space was great. They had a restaurant and food shop,  both seemed overpriced for a campsite and the lady in the shop was so grumpy. We stayed for x2 nights and had no issues.  Hard to get a spot with shade though.  Toilets and cleaning facilities pretty gross and unhygienic I tried to avoid when I could. Good for what it is but overpriced."
18333,2871809,5,serge77,19/06/2023,"5 stars because we can not put more ... beautiful organization, everything is clean and very practical."
18333,2852063,4,JOAOCDFREITAS,13/06/2023,"A luxury campsite with all the comforts, 5 minutes from the beach on foot. Price 2 nights, 1 tent, 3 people and 1 car €52. (Luxury is paid for!) Electricity included for all plots and access to the pool. Good barbecue area and washing and drying machines from €4.50. We will return without a doubt but in low season!!! I do not recommend in high season if you are looking for tranquility!"
18333,2844940,4,isabelllaaa,11/06/2023,"Nice facility, but pitches with free choice of space (D and E) not so nice, uneven and access a bit difficult. Sanitary facilities only half open. Pool available. Very very good restaurant!!! 5 stars for this alone"
18333,2838188,5,NIDIonTour,10/06/2023,"We give it a full 5 stars! We really liked it here and instead of 1 night we stayed 3. Magnificent beaches and nice village, absolutely quiet. Very clean sanitary facilities and hot showers. We were here in early May and the place was busy. Would stay there again anytime."
18333,2830613,5,coporado,07/06/2023,"Very good place with many places, a bit uneven, some sandy. Lots of toilets and showers. Beaches are fantastic, only the view of the industrial area of simes disturbed the picture. Highly recommended. With Acsi €21/€27 depending on the category"
18333,2829668,5,APE299,07/06/2023,"This is how a campsite should be. Super, after what we have experienced in Portugal so far"
18333,2821968,4,Almi12345,05/06/2023,Nice place with a large selection of different pitches. The facilities were clean. 10 min from the village and beaches. The only criticism is the shop. Opens in the morning from 9am and closed all day on Monday. You should order rolls in advance so you don't have to wait in line for too long.
18333,2819322,4,socoapc,04/06/2023,Very clean campsite with good signage. Very attentive staff. Very correct price €42 for 2 nights for 2 and 7 m motorhome with ACSI electricity
18333,2819115,3,TripleOne,04/06/2023,"Plant divided into different price categories, area with freely selectable places neglected (old access roads, view of non-renovated buildings) with 24 € for two people too expensive. Also other places with 28/30€ to truer. Current cannot be deselected in any category; not to accept."
18333,2816861,4,Mzelou,03/06/2023,"Good campsite, very good welcome and pleasant stay. Only downside the electricity does not really work and there are not enough functional outlets for everyone"
18333,2803612,5,SolarJoe,30/05/2023,"Offers everything you need and much more. We are very impressed by this place, actually only wanted to stay 1 night, which turned into 3 really great, many lonely beaches. Great price. Paid €21 with 2 adults. Come again. ACSI was somehow not accepted on the pitch because we were on the cheapest one anyway (in the Binienwald)."
18333,2800841,3,Puschl,29/05/2023,"Campsite maintained, sanitary good, central. Too bad the WiFi doesn't work at all. And I would have been happy to be able to choose, with or without electricity."
18333,2799228,4,joelponpon,29/05/2023,"Good welcome and good locations with 1 flower and 2 flower areas. €3 difference but not much difference. I do not put 5 stars because pitches not mown, very little busy mini-market with x2 x3 prices, rats, stray cats and stray dogs. Nice swimming pool. very good stay."
18333,2799205,4,park4night56570,29/05/2023,"Very nice space for undefined tents and vans, pleasant welcome, 21st car tent for 1 person, beach 10m's walk away."

18333,2784751,5,patmar30,25/05/2023,Large campsite with delimited places. Swimming pool and toilets very clean. Price €21 for 2 with a CC and electricity. Ideal for one or more nights. Beautiful beaches nearby. I recommend.
18333,2774222,5,BiancaVanlife2022,21/05/2023,25 euros for camper and 2 people with electricity. We chose section A. The campsite is well maintained and clean. Nice pool with enough sunbeds for this time of year. Sanitary large and clean with very hot shower. Washing machine I found pricey 5 euros. Supermarket only used for fresh bread. The village is attractive and under construction. 2 beautiful bays within walking distance
18333,2765480,4,Kristin11,19/05/2023,"Place good, parceled out, quiet. Shop not used because the opening times didn't match. Water for washing up cold, shower only lukewarm."
18333,2745769,3,FamZeybek,13/05/2023,"Positive: Proximity to the sea, plots in areas D and E offseason empty and therefore a lot of space, sanitary facilities ok, washing machines super Negative: Not enough selection in the Mercado, especially fruit and vegetables, reception not particularly friendly (except for the night porter)"
18333,2744722,3,Gunter-LL,12/05/2023,"A CP that is in the immediate vicinity of Porto Covo and the surrounding beaches, and therefore scores. The mercado only opens at 9.00 a.m., at 9.30 a.m. the bread and pastries were sold out, despite the long queue. The restaurant closed.....The sanitary facilities are clean, the water for cleaning the dishes was lukewarm to cold. 4 stars?"
18333,2740766,5,schnabelewopski,11/05/2023,"Well maintained campsite in a great location. Nice place and beautiful bays within 10 minutes walking distance. Very fair price (21€ motorhome, two adults, one child with ACSI). The pitches could be designed a little more lovingly, but that's complaining at a high level. Pool area great (so far the best on our trip through ESP and P) including a toddler pool."
18333,2740076,5,Reiziger14,10/05/2023,"Huge campsite, and I was in a very small spot, but it was ok. Well crooked. It's close together. Sanitary facilities and swimming pool are neat. There is a shop with a very limited range. Beautiful beaches, restaurants and a mini supermarket within walking distance. Wi-Fi available. There is currently no hot water in the dishes"
18333,2736103,5,GiddyGirl,09/05/2023,"great campsite. immaculate facilities 5 mins walk to village / many dramatic beaches. Big cliffs beware with dogs but cute village with a couple of bars, restaurants & shops. Very friendly locals. Great stay thanks."
18333,2733233,5,LCQR98,08/05/2023,"Just a perfect campsite. Nothing to say 500m from the beautiful coves of Porto Covo. 21€ ACSI beautiful pitches, top-of-the-line sanitary facilities + snack bar, swimming pool, beautifully appointed BBQ area, laundry (the product in the machine smells really good). We had a great time here. See you soon on the road, Christophe&Nathalie"

18333,2723177,3,kilkenny-fan,04/05/2023,"The place is actually really nice. Close to the beach, pool, everything looks fairly new. BUT: 22 euros for bike and small tent, same as the van next door. I find it really a bit much!!!!"
18333,2712584,3,Piaeh,01/05/2023,"We stood at the ""collection point"" at the back (more like a festival feeling), these weren't that nice. But the sanitary facilities are okay. The front - individual seats looked very nice but unfortunately all occupied."

18333,2693022,3,randal668416,24/04/2023,"Average place and too expensive for it. There are currently no toilets, showers or the possibility to wash dishes on the rear parking spaces. Reception so-so... Communication difficult because hardly any English was spoken. We drove on after one night."
18333,2684281,4,coockie57,20/04/2023,Great campsite. Clear and sufficiently large plots. Very neat sanitary facilities. Within walking distance of the coast. Recommended.
18333,2675764,5,Tara87,16/04/2023,A really nice campsite. Everything clean and well maintained. The sanitary facilities in particular are great. The pool was already open and totally beautiful. It is about 500 m to the beach. We would come again.
18333,2666729,3,karinfreke,13/04/2023,"Fine for 1 night. First of all, we are not fans of resort-like campsites, we quickly find it too massive. So is this one. You can choose from a small or spacious camping spot. We paid 25 e for a spacious spot in the preseason incl. acsi discount. fine showers. Wifi unfortunately bad (despite the fact that the campsite was half empty) But the area is beautiful, close to cliffs and various beaches."
18333,2658932,5,JusIna,10/04/2023,"Best campsite on our trip • very well-kept new facility • large sanitary facilities, are cleaned several times a day, always clean • beautiful pool area • small, fine mini market • we had a nice, quiet pitch on a meadow (2 flower category) • path to the beach or town in a few minutes walk • great stay"
18333,2641402,4,Domnque,05/04/2023,"Campsite with all amenities. shadow or sun. The place is worth it. A hike on the Fishermen's Trail, for example. Since 01.04. also is the pool open. Washing machine: can pay for it directly with a card or download an app and via Paypal. Then you will be notified when the laundry is done"

18333,2634421,1,mexi2000,01/04/2023,Unfortunately only one star. The greatest place is of no use if bungalows are rented out to groups of young people who riot all night and the administration cannot be reached. Never again!!!
18333,2629074,5,Europa2023,29/03/2023,All super clean. Friendly staff. Close to beautiful beaches. Nothing to note :)
18333,2628580,5,K.Keller,28/03/2023,"I would gladly give more stars if I could. It was the best campsite on our tour. We paid €18 with ASCI for a mobile home, 2 people, 2 dogs and electricity, for clean toilets and showers with hot water. The pitches are really big and separated by a hedge and it's totally quiet at night. The beach is a dream."

18333,2584900,5,dorsetian,20/02/2023,"Can't really give the site less than 5 stars as it has everything in abundance and is very clean. However it is a family friendly ""resort"" so not our normal choice. Facilities were great and it was ideal for a night to get a shower. Receptionist very helpful and friendly. Good value at 20 euros for camper and two people."

Very friendly staff. Walk to the sea about 5 minutes. Local restaurants are also now open. On the beach route there are also many opportunities to stand ""wildly"" directly on the beach. Dogs are also allowed here. Per night for 1 WOMO, 2 people and 1 dog from €19 to around €26. ACSI cards give a discount here"

18333,2564912,5,jackjill,31/01/2023,"We've just arrived and so far so good! It's a cut above the others, lovely facilities, extremely clean and spacious. I recommend without hesitation. We pay 20€ for 2 people, 2 dogs, a van, electricity, water   WiFi.   Not bad at all! Friendly staff."
18333,2564798,5,tehonu,31/01/2023,"Difficult to find better: for 18€ with a c.car and 2 people here is an ultra neat modern clean campsite in perfect condition with a top-notch welcome. Everything is available on foot within a radius of 500m: dream beaches (out of season!!) and the town center of a neat little resort (even a very good ice cream on the central square). For the ""beautiful season"" it will surely be necessary to book."

18333,2538640,2,ThomasKrebs,02/01/2023,"I found €20 in the low season without working WiFi for one person plus camper too expensive and drove on. I am now standing north of Sines on a huge CP, also without WiFi, but for €8.80. And there are no dogs barking in the area."
18333,2520356,4,garneleauftour,12/12/2022,In itself a nice place and 18 € for 2 people and a camper also really fine. But an additional €6 for a medium-sized dog (knee height) is really very expensive! €24 in total in the off-season is not a little. But otherwise everything clean and very nice!
18333,2515970,5,wagnersvanlife,08/12/2022,"Very nice quiet place. We were there at the end of November and it wasn't very busy. Top sanitary facilities. Walking distance to the place. Restaurant is very upscale, we had delicious and cheap food in town. Highly recommend, a bit hard to find."

18333,2478263,5,HelmutMeyer,02/11/2022,"Nice campsite with a very friendly welcome. The wash house is very modern and clean, large parking space with water and electricity. The parking fee of 18 euros/night in the off-season (including use of the pool) is very fair."
18333,2475805,5,happinessseller,01/11/2022,"Nov 1, 2022. Everything was perfect. The stuff was very friendly and helpful. They have even small grocery shop (works till 7pm) and restaurant (works till 10pm) on the territory. Highly recommend."

18333,2464263,5,FranziWeiss,27/10/2022,"October 12th: It was ""only"" a stopover, but you could have stayed longer. In itself a fairly large place, when we were there there was a lot of free space in the front part by the eucalyptus trees and our stay was very pleasant. Sanitary facilities so far the best we had seen (coming from the north), very modern, tidy & clean. 5-10min to the coast with great bays & to the place with bars"
18333,2447605,5,Gabriela4466,16/10/2022,Very nice campsite. There are 4 different prize categories depending on where you stand. Prices were between 18 - 32 €. You can choose whether you want a pitch in a free area or in plots. The ground could be made a little more level in the plots. Sanitary facilities are very clean. It is a very well-kept facility. The beach with great bays is about 5 minutes walk.
18333,2443209,5,SabineBrinker,14/10/2022,"Wonderful campsite, staff very nice and helpful. Everything very clean and well-kept. Nice pool area, pool bar, restaurant. Only the mini market is very expensive and has hardly any products. Short way to many beautiful bays."
18333,2442681,5,bettyluxe,14/10/2022,"We liked it very much, but we also booked an expensive gravel pitch. We wouldn't have liked it under the eucalyptus trees and many of the other pitches were very uneven. The sanitary facilities are clean, there is a tiny supermarket on the site and a restaurant, as well as a well-kept pool area. Beaches and restaurants are within easy walking or cycling distance"
18333,2442066,4,Taveirne,13/10/2022,"We spent 2 nights, a comfortable, nickel campsite 10m walk from the beach, the pitches at 20 euros are super good and spacious, I recommend"

The only ""disadvantage"": far to the (very modern and clean!) washrooms otherwise everything was very nice! Also the pool is very nice. The restaurant looks really stylish... can't comment on the prices or the food...walking distance to the beach & village (12min.)"
18333,2438368,5,lifri,11/10/2022,Very nice place (the plots in front). Walking distance to the sea. Very nice bay with a nice beach and a restaurant in the bay. Sufficient sanitary facilities for the place and very well maintained.

18333,2428663,5,kenayl,07/10/2022,"I don't understand the bad customer reviews. I was here in October and it was just gorgeous. dog friendly, beach stunning, the smell of the eucalyptus trees is great, clean sanitary facilities (better than in the picture). the place is even too chic and classy for me. the campsite is reminiscent of a Robinson Club."
18333,2412703,2,jf11,29/09/2022,"This campsite has 2 faces, the entrance, the swimming pool, the bungalow area, very clean and very well maintained with lawn and palm trees. Then you have the area for free pitch motorhomes which has been abandoned for a long time. No delimited place, slope everywhere, ground covered with eucalyptus bark and even broken branches! The toilet block shown on the plan and dedicated to this area is closed and falling into ruin! You just have 2 taps that work more or less for the whole area. With the ACSI card I paid €20, which normally corresponds to a real pitch in a very nice campsite! This is not the case at all! I must specify that during the entrance, the very friendly receptionist offered me places 2 or 3 flowers ??? !!!! much more comfortable! This campsite does not respect the spirit of the ACSI card!!! You are informed, I do not understand the many (too many ???) positive opinions."
18333,2371681,3,Laercio,14/09/2022,"I spent 13 nights here, it is a good camping with everything you need, but it is definitely overpriced at almost €50 night for what you get, the first 7 days I spent in a very step place much smaller than the one I paid, after that they moved me to a 3 flowers one that was more flat and very big, I stayed in the caravan zone with stones floor, the other not paved dirt zone is much more inclined."
18333,2368350,4,jamesiai,13/09/2022,"Pretty campsite. Nice staff. We chose the free plots area in quieter more shaded area of campsite amid tall trees. Pretty planting & small bungalows. Big pool-  a bit too busy for us as lots of kids still on holiday. Lovely village nearby with various shops, eateries, a supermarket with vegan options & gorgeous roof top bar. Near beach but sea was rough. Couple & camper van - 20 euros with ACSI."
18333,2344081,5,AndreAraujo,06/09/2022,"Excellent camping, with all the services and very close to the beaches and the center of the village. Good pool and large bathrooms. Worth the Price. We paid €61/night for plot A, in front of the pools for a 7.20m 6 person motorhome."
18333,2343665,4,aschnatt,06/09/2022,All in all a nice campsite with some large eucalyptus trees. There are different types of places.
18333,2341444,4,VanPieron,05/09/2022,"We stayed on a medium-sized pitch which was well defined. Plenty of space, clean, water and electricity available. Cold and unfriendly reception at the reception. Quite expensive for us because we did not use the sanitary facilities and the swimming pool. Beautiful beach within walking distance."
18333,2315733,5,Carcabana,28/08/2022,"It's not cheap but you pay for what it offers. A great campsite, clean, large pitches, very friendly staff, swimming pool... facilities of 10 in short."
18333,2261816,4,filipesousa84,18/08/2022,I just payed 6.50€ to empty my black and grey water and fill up my clean tanks. Expensive but no choices around.
18333,2243856,5,coroas,15/08/2022,"Beautiful campsite, great pool, great service. Close to beaches and town. It was very busy due to the holiday and we didn't use the restrooms as there was a line."
18333,2179874,4,FernandoNeto,05/08/2022,nice campsite very clean swimming pool super. negative point the price seems excessive to me and the mini market is really too small given the size of the campsite.
18333,2179850,3,loloh,05/08/2022,well located campsite near the beach and the village of Porto Covo. the camper pitches are large and very clean. the cleanliness of the toilets is random. a beautiful swimming pool
18333,2174656,5,Angelpal,04/08/2022,"Camping in perfect condition, clean and tidy with all the services for a motorhome. If I came back to this area I would happily repeat. We paid €36 per night / 2 adults with all services in high season."
18333,2173561,1,EvaLuna77,04/08/2022,"Not expensive, very expensive. 60 euros for the free camping area that is a dunghill. Pool bar menu where they hold you up for food that seems like a joke: gazpacho which is watermelon-colored water, guacamole from a phosphorescent green jar, … 4 people: 65 euros without dessert and with two soft drinks and water, 2 hamburgers, 1 chicken salad, gazpacho and guacamole. We will not return nor given away."
18333,2157338,4,soysergio1,01/08/2022,"A very clean campsite with lots of shade, the pool is ideal for babies and there is a shady lawn. It is close to the beach and the town, although it is a bit expensive."
18333,2154007,4,Markmetznbus,31/07/2022,"Nicely set up campsite. Tent, camper and holiday homes. In my Portugal top 3!  Camping pitches in the sun and shade under eucalyptus trees.  Spacious pitches with electricity.  Many very beautiful beaches in beautiful bays and a pittoresque village with the best (fish) restaurants are a 10-minute walk away.  Sanitary is absolutely sublime, but a bit of a walk from the shaded areas.  A top spot!"
18333,2142127,4,zolivermp63,29/07/2022,"Very comfortable campsite, beautiful pitches, clean toilets (regularly cleaned), pleasant swimming pool, close to magnificent beaches on foot, we even extended our stay, only downside: €50 per night 2 adults, 2 children (children over 10, counts as an adult)"
18333,2139703,4,mariemauro,29/07/2022,"Camping with swimming pool, restaurant, snack bar and small market. Toilets, laundry and showers always tidy and clean. Excellent location to reach the beach and the center. 35 / night, 2 adults, 1 camper pitch with electricity and water."
18333,2130764,4,brunabc14,27/07/2022,Nice spot! A lot of showers and clean toilets!
18333,2125639,4,LiliCamper,26/07/2022,"Large campsite, recent sanitary facilities, clean, two areas: one with pitches of 2 sizes to choose from, the other more shaded without delimitation. Electricity and sometimes water on the plots. Disadvantage: very expensive"
18333,2122737,5,caratortuga,25/07/2022,"Friendly staff, new and clean bathrooms and showers, the entire campsite very well cared for. We have been in the bottom part with a camper and there is enough shade between the eucalyptus trees. Pool and electricity included in the price. Very good experience."
18333,2100685,4,Damien8234,21/07/2022,Campsite more than correct compared to some comments. Free pitch 37 euros with camper van 2 children and electricity included. Swimming pool as new. Whimsical welcome. Very functional service area.
18333,2093115,4,Melala,19/07/2022,Very clean but a little expensive 46 euros van 2 adults and 2 children. Good location close to the beach
18333,2089516,2,Joost08,18/07/2022,"Small spots, lots of sand, grumpy staff. We won't be back"
18333,2068975,1,SusannaAmala,13/07/2022,"I confirm, also in my opinion, most of the reviews are from the owners of the campsite. the piece is really high for the service offered expensive, dirty, small and with little shade Not recommended very expensive, very dirty and very little shade ..... and WiFi ?????"
18333,2053947,1,GuiomarH,09/07/2022,"I suspect that several reviews are from the campsite itself. We just paid €30 for a small plot, two people in a Camper, with electricity. The bathrooms are new, but the bins are overflowing with waste, the first sinks are clogged, there is no toilet paper... Anyway, it's not what it seems... reception is friendly, but I recommend going in and checking if it fits to your expectations."
18333,2051926,5,Elenabusto,09/07/2022,"A clean, beautiful and well-kept campsite. You can choose between several types of plots, some very large. Fabulous services. Close to several beaches."

18333,2044334,5,orpsmotorhome104,06/07/2022,"Amazing space, excellent conditions, close to everything. We were supposed to stay 2 nights and ended up staying 4. I recommend it."
18333,2042150,4,JuliaH8,06/07/2022,"A very nice and clean campsite. Lots of toilets and showers and very well maintained pool area. The village is surprisingly beautiful, with many restaurants and shops. 1 star deduction because the restaurant on the pitch is too exclusive. You pay for a main course from 29€ and there are only 3 dishes to choose from. In our opinion, it does not belong on a family campsite."
18333,2042133,5,mireiamk,05/07/2022,"Very nice camping, eith good and clean facilities. Nice pool and friendly staff. Fully recommended!"
18333,2022055,5,JMF76,29/06/2022,"Very nice campsite, top sanitary facilities, top pool and very friendly staff. The bays and the beach are a dream. The small town of Porto Covo with its many shops and restaurants completes the positive result. Plenty of rest to relax and escape from everyday life."
18333,2020941,5,jbo777,29/06/2022,They let us in even as we were late and the reception was closed. Fair prices for a very nice and clean place. Lots of services and a nice big pool. All in all a pleasent surprise!
18333,2006313,4,jammumad,24/06/2022,"We were at the beginning of July for 3 days. Very clean, better pitches in zone A and C. Pool very good, bathrooms very clean. All services fine. Very close to the beaches, 12 min walk and the center of the town where you can eat very well in many places. I recommend it"
18333,1997618,5,lotta02,21/06/2022,"Very luxurious campsite! Very well equipped washhouses, loads of toilets and showers, nice BBQ areas, eucalyptus trees, pool & parasols, 10 min walk to village & beach, great sunsets! Nice staff, free wifi, 40€ for 2 nights, 2 people, campervan & electricity. Washing machine €4.50"
18333,1982677,3,JeanMichelDavid,16/06/2022,"Impeccable toilets, on the other hand the part reserved for tents, as often sand irregular ground access to water and toilets far enough lamentable compared to the rest of the campsite we see that there is no effort."
18333,1982672,4,remMacMiller,16/06/2022,"Everything clean/ modern, a real campsite. We liked it, depending on the pitch you pay more or less. The town is nice, the beach is within walking distance! The staff at the reception are sometimes a bit shy, but still nice! A real luxury for a few nights!"
18333,1976728,3,loppieontour,14/06/2022,"Nice campsite, quite chaotic at the reception. Places on the free section are not recommended. Other places and sanitary facilities are sufficient. Beach 500m walk"
18333,1970152,4,rodym,12/06/2022,"Beautiful complex. We had a large 3-flower motorhome fully equipped and a little shade to sit in. Very busy on weekends, pool overcrowded but beach within walking distance. Good thing we made a reservation. Great place."
18333,1967492,3,Steffi.und.Tobi,11/06/2022,"Space and sanitary facilities great and modern. Water for rinsing cold and chalky. Reception was friendly, but you first have to walk the course and choose a plot before you can drive in. Very cumbersome, especially with a small child. No indication of free WiFi or advance notice that prices increase every few days in June. Only one wash house is open"
18333,1925504,5,Miguelmmartins,28/05/2022,Very nice camping with very fair prices. Highly recommended.
18333,1924331,5,WNKonTRV,28/05/2022,"Super campsite, sanitary modern and clean, washing machine and dryer available. Swimming pool open although net should be closed in May. Great little coves nearby. We paid 21.5 EUR for 2 adults and 1 child, caravan. Highly Recommended!"
18333,1916676,5,Nely,26/05/2022,"Very good campsite, with good pitches, large and very clean toilets. totally recommended"
18333,1914514,5,bb.stefkovic,25/05/2022,"Very new-looking campsite. Everything was clean, nice, and very adapted for children (playground, showers, toilets, etc). There were few people at the moment, a very quiet place. Currently, the pool is only open on weekends. 10-15 minutes from the city center and the beach. I recommend, we were satisfied."
18333,1908420,4,Brestan,22/05/2022,"The young man at the reception gets 5 ******. So friendly and helpful. 20€/d campers incl. 2 people. and electricity. Everything as described before. Standing in the shady ""free zone"" -> great. A Saniblock was still out of order and the pool was still being worked on. Sanitary everything immaculate. Clear recommendation!!! How some people leave toilets and disposal facilities behind remains a mystery."
18333,1900878,3,PhoenixCologne,19/05/2022,"At first it should be 35,-€. When we wanted to drive again, the price was suddenly €23.50. Still not a bargain for the pre-season with the pool and mini-market closed and the rest of the day in the restaurant. Sanitary facilities were clean and sufficient."
18333,1896758,5,TeamT6,17/05/2022,"Very well maintained campsite, very modern and clean sanitary facilities. Several beautiful bays within walking distance (between 5-15 min easy). Currently (mid-May 22) the pool is unfortunately closed. Very elegant and accordingly high-priced restaurant. VW California + 2 people + electricity —> 23€ per night"
18333,1875006,5,dan07,07/05/2022,"Price defying all competition for the services (20 € with electricity for Ccar and 2 people) Open swimming pool, numerous and impeccable sanitary facilities. Possible choice shade or sun. Check in a bit long and bureaucratic..."

Rebooking was not possible due to the not very friendly staff! Totally inflexible! Restaurant on the square is top (first class)"
18333,1840205,5,park060520,20/04/2022,"Very clean place. A bit expensive for the low season (24€/night), but very clean and many toilets and showers."

18333,1810288,5,gretchen1501,08/04/2022,Clean and groomed. Nice personel! Prices more than reasonable. 2 people and a van from €16 per night. All right:)
18333,1809013,5,familyrideTV,07/04/2022,Excellent park to stop and have as a starting point for some bike rides or walking around Porto Covo. Super clean and organized. Staff 5*
18333,1767538,5,hapi05,27/02/2022,"Great service, everything is very spacious, very clean, we paid €19 per night including electricity. Gourmet restaurant on the campsite, unfortunately with associated prices ?. Would visit the place again at any time."
18333,1764811,4,Prorom,24/02/2022,"Well-groomed place with 3 categories. Premium (€20) on a new gravel pitch, meadow/sand or trees (€19), meadow/sand with eucalyptus trees (€18). Some places at the entrance with pretty flower beds. Most renovated in 2018/19. 5 mins to Praia Grande. Bread service. Chem. Toilet Ents. at the service area and 3x behind women's toilets. Restaurant expensive but good. Very good pizzeria Bella Vita in town."
18333,1764088,1,bangiverden,23/02/2022,Nice clean place but considering that restaurant and pool is closed it is seriously overpriced at 33 Euro for one night campervan with electricity
18333,1757650,4,Chrissis58,16/02/2022,very nice campsite. beautiful sanitary facilities. with a very good restaurant.
18333,1755623,4,opakeule,14/02/2022,like 2 years ago at our last stop here everything is fine. everything clean and in good condition. 18 € with dog and Acsi. 10% space occupied. Nice reception.
18333,1754645,4,Wooolfy,13/02/2022,"Very well maintained beautiful place and sanitary facilities. Currently only about 10% occupied. With ACSI 16.20 including electricity. Larger mobile homes would also find space here. You choose the place on foot beforehand, you are not allowed to curve around and search. The only disadvantage - you are not allowed to use the washing machines on Saturdays and Sundays and there is also a point deduction for the lack of waste separation"
18333,1745530,5,SkippyAU,01/02/2022,"Lovely site, walk into the pretty town. Excellent facilities, lots of showers/WC’s etc. Very nice pool and restaurant (not open Mon-Wed at the moment). Wifi and electricity work well. Some of the pitches might be a bit difficult for big rigs to access. €16.20 with ACSI discount for camper van and 2 adults"
18333,1711845,5,Porterricks,18/12/2021,"Very nice CP, well managed, clean. The way to the beach is easy to walk, not too far. The place offers little variety in winter, some restaurants and shops are closed. A small supermarket is good for the essentials."
18333,1700260,5,maria41,29/11/2021,"Fantastic facilities. Prices vary depending on plot chosen. Discount for ACSI Cards. Very hot water in the showers and taps. Our nearest Toilet/shower block is HUGE and Spotless. Plots are not totally flat. Definitely worth a stay to relax for a couple of days. Very good WiFi near the shower block by the chalets, if parked there."
18333,1677417,4,artfloriani,04/11/2021,The facilities are great and the space is amazing for a break after camping in the wild for a few nights. The hot shower was strong and the staff was very kind. I’m only rating 4 stars as I think 16eur for a night for one person was quite pricey.
18333,1673049,5,twiggy62,01/11/2021,"I stood in peace under the eucalyptus trees for 4 days. Good wifi, hardworking cleaning staff (even the top of the partition walls in the sanitary block were vacuumed and washed) and friendly people at the desk. The shop is not much for the beginning of November. Since the weather was bad all over Portugal, it wasn't too bad here. you can take walks along the beautiful rocky coast."
18333,1655153,2,audreycalys,21/10/2021,"18th depending on location, 6th the dog !!!!!! 25 toilets and 25 showers for women it must be the same for men to say the capacity of reception whereas 2 machines, I waited from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. to make a machine, swimming pool, bar, restaurant closed so I have nothing made my day. Just spent 30 th for a machine. Welcoming staff and clean place anyway."
18333,1651939,3,CatherineKenny,19/10/2021,Everything OK but why is the pool closed and shop almost out of stock of everything? ACSI book says open all year? And €6 per night for a dog seems unreasonable when they aren't using any facilities.
18333,1647393,5,Joao28,16/10/2021,"Very good, everything very clean and new. There is everything you need here. 100% recommendable. The staff is also very nice and helpful."
18333,1646935,5,najo,16/10/2021,"Paid 18€ a night for a numbered site, would be 16€ in the cheapest area, but that was quite far from everything and less nice. (Prices are the same with ore without power) 
Everything was clean and the receptionist was friendly.

The only thing I do not understand: Why is the pool already closed in October?"
18333,1645335,5,DebbyCtH,15/10/2021,"With the ASCI we paid €18 per night. Bus, 2 people and dog. We were on top of the hill in the old part. Lots of shade and free choice in looking for a place. The campsite is super neat, as are the sanitary facilities. Perfectly walking distance to the beaches and the small village."
18333,1638704,5,VanGaab,11/10/2021,€ 25 but they are paid with pleasure. All wonderful.
18333,1627222,5,riverjay,05/10/2021,"I endet up here involuntarily but was a good place for the night, quiet, good facilities, showers included. Lots of trees to give shade. I only paid 10,- for one person and my Opel Combo."
18333,1627131,4,Romanini,04/10/2021,"Good campsite, poorly signposted. Very friendly receptionist, speaks Spanish. Various types of pitches, we chose the highest area, behind the bungalows where we were very quiet. beach 10 minutes walk and town 20. The coast to Sines full of different beaches with parking."
18333,1621058,5,LLX2R,01/10/2021,Great camping. Very clean and spacious toilets.
18333,1610545,5,fitvegan,26/09/2021,Somewhat more expensive but worth it. Very clean toilets and showers. The perfect pool. Quiet atmosphere. Plot of adequate size.
18333,1606905,5,lobesoa,25/09/2021,"Very top campsite. Very careful environment. Very good, large and clean facilities. 2 people with van € 22 / night with electricity included. Quiet at night. The free camping area is the cheapest. It has a restaurant inside that looks good. It is recommended to make a prior reservation (they did not have a place the same day for dinner). VERY RECOMMENDED !!"
18333,1578487,5,SaraGraves,14/09/2021,"Nice, quiet, very clean. Staff was friendly and gave us good recommendations. The restaurant and mini market are closed on Tuesday and Wednesday and the pool was closed due to maintenance, we just walked 10 min to the village and had some lovely grilled fish about 5 min from the sea. 30€ for two people including electric. Most campervan plots are shaded by trees which is ideal. No complaints!"
18333,1523845,5,carolina34567,28/08/2021,"I couldn't recommend it more, very good indeed! Well-delimited space, bathrooms in condition, with many activities, restaurant with a chef who needs an appointment! Very good indeed, new park! We pay 32€ for Ac 2 people with all inclusive"
18333,1493403,5,yayo13,21/08/2021,"Very well-kept campsite, with very attentive facilities and staff."
18333,1462029,3,Mirennn,15/08/2021,"Expensive for what it is. A van and 2 people 37 euros. Small, glued plots separated by ropes, without privacy. Clean bathrooms. The pool is fine."
18333,1449441,1,threeinwood,13/08/2021,"One sanitary block for the whole campsite, unrestricted placement area for 45th for 3 with a van, expensive for what it is"
18333,1424805,1,wuilliaume,08/08/2021,Good but very overpriced. 50 euros the cheapest location… for a van with two adults and two children.
18333,1324286,5,AnaMadrid,14/07/2021,"We loved the campsite. everything new, large facilities, very clean. They asked us for a Covid vaccination certificate to register. 5 minutes walk from the beach. A beautiful cove. The town is small. It has a pedestrian promenade with shops and restaurants. They ask for a covid test to be able to eat inside, but at the tables outside there is no problem. Lovely staff."
18333,1286061,3,ALX667,29/06/2021,"Complicated registration. The campsite is more geared towards tents than motorhomes. The places are sandy and quite uneven. Wedges sink into the ground. Clean sanitary facilities. Unfortunately, the area lacks flair. There is another campsite in the village that cannot be found here or on the internet - it may be better."
18333,1282318,2,AlfonsoPineda,27/06/2021,"The campground is fine, facilities updated, and friendly staff. I only give two stars for the price. For one night, one person and one van, the price ranged from € 22 to € 25. It includes the light, but when I said that I did not need it, they told me that there was no possibility of not hiring it. It seems like a disproportionate price for a campsite in June."
18333,1233428,4,celiayjavier,03/06/2021,"The campsite is very good and very complete, everything new and clean, we were disappointed with the ground for motorhomes and tents, uneven and very dirty with dirt and leaves, there is a part with black gravel that is better but for one night we did not want to change. Everything else perfect"
18333,1233087,4,Rpmendonca,03/06/2021,"Full park, friendly staff and very well located. €24 for 2 adults and 1 child. Clean shower rooms. pool closed in May."
18333,1218336,4,Babsbarrino,25/05/2021,Place is not ready yet but they are working on it. Sanitary facilities are great. Price is also good we paid € 20 per night for 2 adults and 2 children. Pool only opens on June 1st.
18333,1211489,4,Pipok,22/05/2021,"We’ve just purchased our MH and this was our first stop for 2 nights so difficult for us to compare re rating etc however we can say it is open although the pool was closed which was disappointing. We did phone ahead to make sure they were open but they didn’t mention the pool closure. Cost €32pn for 3 adults & EHU but lovely size pitch. They are doing maintenance to parts of the camping area but no noise. I’m sure we’ll be back as Porto Covo is an easy walk, pretty & with very good restaurants."
18333,1205163,5,Rasjahcor,18/05/2021,"Camping well adapted to our vehicles with all services and a specific area for AC's and campers. In the restaurant you eat very well and the town is beautiful with beautiful coves and beaches. I also recommend the pizzas that they make in the village at the restaurant ""La dolce vitta""."
18333,1198017,5,Perdi2xelmundo,14/05/2021,Good camping. It has everything you could ask for for a pleasant stay with a motorhome and two adults. Well-kept and clean common places and services. A short walk from Porto Covo. € 18 with ACSI card.
18333,1188817,5,Luionwheels,08/05/2021,"Great area with clean facilities and a lot to offer like playground, barbecue area, wifi...."
18333,1183169,5,Jubarte,01/05/2021,"Park with excellent conditions, jackdaws, showers, dish washing area all 5 stars and always clean. Very welcoming and super careful with a lot of maintenance. A park to come back and stay for a few days. An example of a camping site in terms of infrastructure, cleanliness and hygiene care."
18333,1135743,4,eliwithdoggos,07/02/2021,Nice beach and clean sanitary facilities. But I was all alone no other campers. I guess it's to blame the price I paid 6 € per dog that means 12 € with 2 dogs + 18 € for me without electricity. 30 € a day well exaggerated! But the washing machine and dryer work great. € 4.50

18333,1003712,4,Jmsn,26/08/2020,"Park with good access to the beach and the center of Porto corvo. changing rooms always clean. the entrance to the pool should be thought out, because there are people spending all day in the pool, while the queue is increased, due to the covid there cannot be many people inside the enclosure. an area for cars and tents and caravans should also be thought of, it reaches a point that is super confused"

18333,970942,1,lurrikarak,16/08/2020,"Nice and modern campsite, but we have not felt comfortable at all. Queues to shower in a bathroom that was far away, the only area for rubbish in the entire campsite and also the only area for draining water. In addition, we could not enter the pool due to capacity and after 5 minutes there were many more people. Without a doubt, the worst campsite after two weeks in Portugal."
18333,938800,3,Pamela123,08/08/2020,"Nice camping, but very expensive. we had to wait to enter the swimming pool because of a strange corona rule were some people can stay there the whole day and others have to wait for a long time to enter.
the toilets/ showers were ok
there was no option to buy bread in the morning because apparently you had to make a reservation for the bread
for a campsite with this price we expected more"

However, the remaining places are very dusty, sometimes uneven and not okay for the price. The sanitary facilities are great, are often cleaned and are quite new. The location is ok, the beach is about 7 minutes on foot. The course presents itself as ""something finer"" and is glamping on the flag. We went back after one night but can recommend it."

18373,994889,4,LaraVSantorum,23/08/2020,"Spectacular site, very quiet, with the beach in front. Very busy day. Are there showers. There is a beach bar with bathrooms. The place is very dirty. Front-line seats fill up fast. The night we slept (August 2020) the entire parking lot was filled."

The police don't make a problem of us being here as long as the place is respected. It is cleaner than other times. The bad thing is that on weekends young people come to drink, play loud music and shout, without any respect. We called the Civil Guard and they passed us. We couldn't rest all night"

18373,858327,4,quiles11,10/07/2020,"Very good place to spend a night, we slept with 3 vans next to us, with views of a super beautiful landscape. The only bad thing is that there is a bar nearby and until it closes there is a bit of noise"
18373,852294,4,caparrosmarta,06/07/2020,"Ideal to spend the night for the views. We spent two nights, one of them some kids came to make a bottle at dawn and we had to move. A bit dirty (plastics, remains), which detracts from the incredible natural place that it is. We would still return for the night."

There are showers on the beach and a beach bar where they are very friendly. The beach is all stones, it only has sand at low tide, but it is very beautiful."
18373,791306,5,jgonsam,05/03/2020,"Perfect place to sleep or even spend a couple of days, next to the beach, and since it says that the maximum height is 2m there is nothing that limits that, I do not know why the signal but pass with my car 3 , 2m without any problem, the access is by a bridge a little narrow but it passes."
18373,739239,5,Neneriz,06/11/2019,Very quiet and spacious place to sleep. In winter the access road (20mts) deteriorates but is perfectly accessible. And on the beachfront

18373,668223,3,Ulrich65,30/08/2019,"Strange place: a little creepy at night in cloudy weather and low tide, then very nice the next morning with sun and high tide. On the other hand someone stole the radio antenna (Ford transit) during the night."

18373,560919,4,Galifardeu,18/07/2019,"The cove of the dícido in Mioño. Parking for free day and night, is shared with cars. Camping is not allowed so do not take chairs or tables to keep the parking for ac and campers. There's a prohibition sign. The Local Police passed in the afternoon and in the morning and did not comment on the prohibition, there was permissiveness. Surface quite flat, does not require chocks to level ac or camper. Although there is a sign of the height limit, you can have a good time crossing a bridge that is narrow and just enough for an ac. There is no water change zone. If there are showers but you can not use soap, there is a sign that prohibits it. There are two temporary polyclean washbasins and a bar in the same cove. It does not have electricity. There is no chest for cleaning chemical wc. Possible and improvised water source: a nearby shower with a raised button. Very quiet area. Large cove with beach and a natural waterfall in a corner of the cove. Green areas in front to walk to the old shipper of minerals and iron. The only downside is that if there is overcrowding of cars you have to wait for the parking lot to empty so you can leave with an ac. 10 seats approx. The best environment in the sea."

This time it is, again, something very positive, because I found a very calm park, I was welcomed and accompanied by the couple of owners, very helpful and friendly. Everything is neat and clean. One of the best indicators of the potential of a camping is when you sleep well, without noise, that is, without cars staying all night, dogs barking or roosters crowing. That's also why I'll be back for sure!"

It goes to the shoehorn with the cars of the residents. And the vegetation provided at the edge of the road: guaranteed scratch on the CC. We turned around for fear of being blocked the next day at the start. In van or small van it must pass."
18466,2328320,5,BillyBlueBus,01/09/2022,Perfect place with a view! We spent a quiet night here when visiting Barcelona. Locals walking their dogs in the morning are very friendly. Beware of the bores as they live in these areas and come in search for food at night. The path up the hill I believe leads to a viewpoint. Enjoy!

18466,2232658,3,clementhos,13/08/2022,Good but too many converted vehicles. Ok for 2 vehicles. We spent one night there with 4 vehicles: it's too narrow. Other converted vehicles had to turn back for lack of space.

Barcelona in 15 min by Intercity train at La Floresta, 2 km from the spot. calm and clean. a lamppost for the night. Popular place for locals to walk their dogs. Be careful, it's easy to find but these are paths with hairpin bends and not so easy to access. we had a 6m van, we didn't need more..."

18466,1857245,3,uligolou,28/04/2022,Unlikely place. Thanks for the first one who found and shared it. Night at the top. Thank you to motorhomes for not leaving their toilet paper in nature (eg in the path that goes down to the corner of the car park). By dint of places like this we will be banned by local residents and that would be completely normal.

18466,1748008,4,TimWeihmann,05/02/2022,A good spot for an afternoon nap. I didn't stay overnight here. The place was full of rubbish. One of the residents told me that it wasn't yesterday and was probably from a party. So I took pity on me and cleaned up the whole thing. You want to make a good impression :)

18466,1691422,5,JuanVillanuevaAlonso37,17/11/2021,"Ideal for vans I doubt that a motorhome would enter the road since in addition to being narrow the neighbors park on the sides of it. Great if you want to be in nature, spend two nights and felt very safe. In the town next to the station you have a supermarket and many fountains. Although it does not have services, it is highly recommended for people seeking tranquility."

18466,1623448,5,Le_Sko,03/10/2021,"Quiet and pleasant place. Awakened by the song of birds with a view of the scrubland. Indeed the place is rather suitable for vans, relatively flat terrain, and no problems with wild boars for us, but we had taken care not to put food outside (it may have helped) . A few locals turned around but nothing disturbing."
18466,1320423,5,AurelienP,13/07/2021,"Great quiet corner. 2 cars have turned around and locals walking their dogs.

18466,357130,5,piotepo,28/08/2018,Super site. Really very calm. Road a bit complicated because it goes up a lot but it's worth it because we are really quiet. we were able to visit barcelona thanks to the metro. Thank you so much for sharing.
18466,349280,5,Tiwanon,23/08/2018,"Very quiet place. We stayed there 2 nights in a row and were alone there. A few cars came back and we heard the wild boar pass below. As noted elsewhere, not recommended for large vehicles."
18466,323096,4,Max13,09/08/2018,Quiet place with beautiful views but with difficult access for large motorhomes: very narrow streets and with curves very closed in some places. It is important to collect garbage because the place is part of the Natural Park of Collserola.
18466,310987,4,wildearth,02/08/2018,"Is off the beaten track and is therefore quite quiet. From time to time, cars come up to turn or walkers with dogs. Further up is a lookout tower, which was closed at night. Our intention at this spot was also to visit Barcelona"
18466,282565,5,Benjifauxlongo,07/07/2018,"Nice view, quiet place, we saw that some nice walkers and 2-3 residents turn around (road to climb quite steep and narrow), recommended for small templates Exper or Combi style"
18466,255773,5,mackie,20/05/2018,"Beware, neighbors use this site to go around !! Leave room wide, are calling the police and putting fines. Maximum 2 vans !!"
18466,254032,4,kesca,16/05/2018,"Thank you for this spot, quiet and pleasant, do not expect a highway to access the mountain. We were 3 vans and there is room for the residents to turn around;)"
18466,238618,2,Manu89,19/04/2018,"At the top of a small urbanization with access by narrow lane of two senses, in Zig zag and closed turns, maybe with an AC it is more complicated to climb. The site is fine, but you do not have full tranquility, houses very close and at the end of the street many cars go up to give the change of direction for there is a site just for 1. Currently the views seem covered by vegetation."
18466,227336,4,vfrmania,13/03/2018,"Location actually discouraged large size, access is difficult enough if vehicles are parked badly. Place serving as a turn around residents, you must park to allow them. We had some U-turn in the evening and early morning, otherwise very quiet place, 2 steps from Barcelona. No services nearby."
18466,183924,1,philipetlou,24/08/2017,"Place for a motorhome only, dirty place, shame because pretty little corner of nature"
18466,155815,3,swap38,22/07/2017,"It is an area of ​​U-turn at the end of the impasse for the residents, so you have to stand without hindering the passage. Little shade but the night was calm. If I had a 4x4, I would have climbed the stone path because there is a flat and shaded area higher (but turn difficult)."
18466,146331,4,Remilesieur,28/06/2017,The place is magical but there are only two places maximum and very complicated access by truck. Impossible in a motorhome because the inhabitants park themselves by the roadside. We stayed one night and then left to sleep in the city the other night to be closer to the station but it was less good we must admit. Good road to all!
18466,132993,3,trafdromois,04/05/2017,"Access OK for van, difficult to turn around if there are already people. Great maximum 3 vans but nice and quiet corner."
18466,110402,4,laurita,18/10/2016,"We were able to find the site very easily thanks to the GPS coordinates of the application. Top frame and no boar is visiting us, missing only a corner of water and that people do not let drag waste and it would be perfect."
18466,83692,4,armaguidon,21/07/2016,"Super quiet place, for 2 or 3 vans. Some passages of locals who walk their dogs. On the other hand exposed full sun without shadow. It is not Barcelona that we see because we are on the other side of the hill."
18466,81257,3,ducloup@hotmail.fr,13/07/2016,"Space for 2 or 3 vehicles maximum. Very difficult access by camper (very narrow road). If a riparian's vehicle blocks your passage, it will be impossible to turn around and you will have to go down in reverse."

18466,76863,4,falkorr,14/06/2016,"3 nights spent worry free van. Indeed, there is only room for two or three. No wild boar, some walkers or young people. Good compromise to visit Barcelona (6 € round trip by train: 15 minutes)"
18466,68967,3,DuquesneY,16/04/2016,A bit noisy anyway in van (highway and planes).
18466,65630,4,colyziak,17/03/2016,"The rain prevented us from enjoying the beautiful view but allowed us to see the traces of boars that roamed during the night! Several vehicles have gone back, thinking of giving them space. Not recommended for large vehicles"
18466,55025,3,bergau17,15/09/2015,"The presentation is enticing, but it must relativize! In fact, it is a kind of racket at the end of a gravel road, 2 motorhomes maximum in yet it must be embarrassing for those who come to turn around here. It is not Barcelona that we see because we are behind the Tibidabo, but it is superb. Beautiful walks. Access OK for vans but really not recommended for motorhomes. We 6x2, 2x3 it went but just! Branches low and we hope not to cross anyone!"
18466,50615,5,sflat4b,19/08/2015,Location at the top with a great view but beware we had the visit of a wild boar that did not look bad at all. The kids in the truck were very happy to see that close.
18466,35735,3,kleindoeil,07/05/2015,"The pavement of the access road is good and lit at night, but narrow enough and if the cars of the local residents are not well parked, the passage with a large motorhome may be difficult. After a quiet night, we chose to stay near the school La Floresta, a little less quiet but easy to access and 5 minutes walk from the FGC train station."
18466,30727,3,chrysphy,21/01/2015,"Ideal for vans or van but not really recommended for motorhomes, we have a 7m profile not really easy to access the place. When parking 5 vehicles apart from stacking them, I do not see how, really quiet place."

18466,24700,5,Campeure,28/08/2014,"Superb, calm and relaxing, my husband and I enjoyed the walks in the forest, with the view overlooking the plain and behind the Tibidabo, just behind Barcelona! A big thank you for the information !!! It can be accessed with a motorhome or van of reasonable size, large size to avoid."

18474,432769,5,Lauti,23/02/2019,"Secluded place at the end of a cul-de-sac at the highest point of a range of hills. The highway rushes in the background. Directly below is a small historic church with some outbuildings. Everything is very picturesque and if you are alone you can certainly on the terrace his camping furniture set up and breakfast. Unfortunately we had to continue, but would have liked to stay longer."
18474,404753,3,Catashtroumph,05/11/2018,"Quiet spot ideal for a quiet night on the road, but you can hear the highway in the distance. By cons the small church next is cute. Off season top"

In the same restaurant, which also manages the parking lot, they informed us that between 8 in the evening and 10 in the morning, approximately, it was free, however during the rest of the day are €50. No services, but a nice and quiet place next to the beach."
18481,3160239,1,ocanaldovaza,16/08/2023,"very poor in terms of services, zero at all, that is worth it for the location and the desperation of finding a place to park, very difficult in this area, even the beach is not well cared for, it is worth it for being the beach where Salvador Dalí had his holiday home, 50€, at least we're quiet during the day and can sleep, the beach doesn't even have a shower, nothing but beautiful, in the end, the places don't know how to captivate tourism."
18481,3117376,1,PacoBuho,10/08/2023,"Today, August 10, they have closed the car park in the afternoon, we have arrived at 7:50 p.m. and a municipal police officer has informed us to turn around because it is closed."

To spend the day, there is a free car park next to the entrance to Cadaqués, next to 2 paid ones. The night here has been great."
18481,2950068,4,ivansantosm,11/07/2023,"Large area to park and spend the night, in July it didn't cost us anything, the only bad thing is the amount of mosquitoes there are."
18481,2911637,5,BrigitteGuirao,01/07/2023,PS Just ask users to look closely at the signals before posting comments with misinformation. In my case I was about to NOT come to Cadaqués. I have called the tourist office and they have confirmed this information. From 20:00 pm to 10:00 am ALLOWED and FREE. The car park is in the same cove as Casa Dalí.

A clear message that they don't want to see us in town, loud and clear. A pity that they covertly prohibit, instead of regulating our tourism. How few lights."
18481,2754494,1,wildcamper2,16/05/2023,Simple gravel place. Parking fees for cars €5 for mobile homes and vans €50. You probably don't want the camper drivers here.

Frankly the area is lovely but Camping Cars are not welcomed from April for the summer and the roads getting over the mountains are quite scary! Would not like to try in a big camping car.  Fine in a smaller Van.  The Town is beautiful but tiny so it has many visitors it doesn’t need Camping cars in season.
18481,2628229,5,GuenterSchabus,28/03/2023,The parking lot is easy to get to. The navigation system leads to a driving ban. A bypass road north of it leads to the destination.

18481,2492368,5,KMWodicke,12/11/2022,Large parking place between the mountains. There are many campers here and it is quiet at night. Next to Dali's house. Packing is free. Walking to the village is about 15 minutes up and down a steep mountain. Picturesque village with nice restaurants.
18481,2489670,4,Pantany2017,10/11/2022,"We spend a very quiet night, a family of wild boars prowl but do not attack, they are very used to people. The police came by in the morning but didn't say anything to anyone."
18481,2488163,4,RafaelMartinV,08/11/2022,"free parking out of season, no services, ideal when you are independent. Great for visiting Cadaqués and Dalí's house. Do not set up a table. Regular passage of the police. We eat very well at the small Xiringuito Can Juli. Walk to very beautiful little coves. Visit of wild boars even during the day. PS do not feed them or bother them, watch out for your dogs."
18481,2487110,5,Lunamon,08/11/2022,We arrived around 9pm and it was full of fires and super quiet. Super quiet and free night. Super respectful people and no noise.

18481,2483049,3,miekartz,05/11/2022,Lots of wind but free this time of year. Nice place near the sea! No facilities but a possibility to have a drink from Friday to Sunday
18481,2478788,3,forajidoooooo,02/11/2022,"I have read that they charge in the summer... as of today it is free. It is a good pro site without services, you have the beach very close to go at night, which is what I like the most about this site."

18481,2470088,5,delnic,29/10/2022,"Spacious and quiet place. Dish. close to Dali's house and the beach. Do not leave food or trash outside, wild pigs come at night!"
18481,2460996,4,Steph56500,25/10/2022,Parking by the sea. Right next to the Dali house. About ten minutes walk from Cadaques. Very quiet night. We also had the visit of wild pigs. No problem if left alone. A very good time spent at this place totally free at this time. My comment would not have been so complimentary if we had had to pay the 50 euros requested out of season.
18481,2436737,3,mobitravel,11/10/2022,Free off season! It is a large parking lot with a coming and going of RVs/vans. A public toilet would not be out of place since everyone does their needs around the parking lot. We were glad we had our own toilet in the camper. The town of Cadaqes is really great!! Recommended: the calamaris and sardines at the beach bar at the very front of the parking lot / beach.
18481,2422142,4,sensecap,04/10/2022,"Good free place with 2 beach bars next door and the cove of Portlligat, super cool. Despite the fact that it is a town where caravans and motorhomes are highly discriminated against, exceeding road legality by the city council."
18481,2401645,2,zntx,25/09/2022,DIRTY ! and noisy. Haven't slept well here.
18481,2394190,3,Bullas,22/09/2022,GRATUITOUS. They no longer charge €50. Out of season they are not charging admission thanks to the efforts of Juli (owner of the beach bar at the entrance).
18481,2384463,1,Eodrill,19/09/2022,50 euros per night without any service. Even the wild boars run away (after having us the garbage cans at 4am)! Negotiated at 25 euros for 2 nights but to be avoided. There is free parking 50 meters above.
18481,2369809,1,barjou,14/09/2022,"do not go ! Parking is very expensive! the prices are a bit at the head of the customer. at the beginning 30 euro then 25 euro... there is no shower, no WC, no electricity. last year it was not paying .. and now it is very expensive !!! to flee"
18481,2342515,1,Aurorerose,05/09/2022,"€50 for a zero-service dusty pitch! This is not serious. I told the person it was too expensive we haggled at 25€ We give 30€, wait for the 5€ change which does not arrive. We haggle again at 30€ for 2 nights. I have already come several times, but I will no longer be spending money in this town, neither in restaurants nor elsewhere. Shame..."
18481,2334548,1,RaquelCAT,03/09/2022,"50 euros/day for vans of any size and motorhome... A parking lot without services, dirty and dirt. Cadaqués is an IMPOSSIBLE place for us... They have their own abusive law. They call your attention even for parking a small van during the day. Of course, then the motorcycles park where they want, the boats leave them in the coves and there are no fords. A shame and abuse of power."
18481,2326152,1,cvsecar,31/08/2022,fatal! from the €10/24h per camper last year to wanting to STEAL €50. Madam mayor... the pot has gone. Not even the best campsites in Europe with all services charge this. And you intend to charge them for a piece of dusty land? It's a shame because the money that we planned to spend will be spent in a town that loves us and our money. Until never mrs mayor
18481,2318307,1,OsaPolar,29/08/2022,"50 euros is an abuse. We slept in the free parking upstairs next to the hermitage without any problem, there were several campers. It has a height limitation of 2 meters."
18481,2295355,3,northcraftervan,24/08/2022,"We have used it to visit Cadaqués, we have not spent the night, be careful why the parking below is €50/24h... right above it is the P4 in which we have been free. We asked the local police and they told us that this year, as the campsite was closed, they were being more permissive... that if we didn't take out tables, chairs, an awning... that there was no problem."
18481,2291055,1,albertocas,23/08/2022,"beware, they have raised the price to €50 per night, without services, a scam."

18481,2283876,1,Sollube,22/08/2022,"But have we gone crazy? €50 for a field full of dust, without shadows and without any service? There are cheaper places and with jacuzzi!!!"
18481,2248501,2,Celine2525,16/08/2022,"Well put ! But then 50€ is how to say tourist trap!! Suddenly people park along the road, understandable !! At the tourist office we were advised to return to the left side for easier and free parking! Otherwise beautiful Cadaques!!"
18481,2247567,5,JOJUSA,16/08/2022,"It's a pass but of course most of them put tables, chairs as if it were a campsite. Perhaps we should leave it as before at 10 euros and impose fines on those who use the environment correctly."
18481,2227244,1,Jose26an,13/08/2022,€50 without services. quite dirty land area.
18481,2197528,3,katamarano81,08/08/2022,"Early July €10 now €50, no service, no shade, too bad the site is beautiful"
18481,2180935,3,NilsetMath,05/08/2022,Parking without services at 50€. It hurts but it's the only spot where you can land for the night in Cadaqués. The city and the coves are super beautiful. You pay a lot for the spot but it's worth the detour if you want to discover Cadaqués!
18481,2164915,2,Asturcones,02/08/2022,"We were in July and they charged us €10 (acceptable price.) There is no shade and a lot of dust rises with the passage of other vehicles, (but now €50 is not even a campsite with services, let's go) in August the Kosto goes up, it's clear ."
18481,2155077,1,Ernes98,01/08/2022,"Neither I nor anyone consistent will go there paying 50 euros, but if everyone had had a minimum of decency when it came to not opening awnings, or in the case of many other vans, doing their business outside like a puppy, maybe this it wouldn't have happened It is the third place this summer that I find that we are ""prohibited"" from going with motorhomes. Those who peed outside, if they would go."
18481,2151825,1,lauraarisasancho,31/07/2022,"I hope that no one pays €50 to park, it is easier to put a sign where the entrance is banned than to put that ridiculous price."
18481,2148471,1,CANB,30/07/2022,"It is a shame about this town hall, for the theft of charging €50 to motorhomes. It does not deserve that we leave our money where we are not loved or respected."
18481,2143242,4,joelmiguel,29/07/2022,10eur per day with a quiet and peaceful night. excellent option to visit Port Ligat and Cadaquez!

18481,2121275,1,Carpvan12,25/07/2022,"The place was fine but we started paying for the week (the first day they charged us 10 euros at the bar, they kept 5 as management fees) the second day the person in charge charged us and he charged us 5 for being a small van, the third One day the police come and tell him that the mayor has ordered that the price be raised to 50 euros on the day we are given to understand that he does not want motorhomes there."
18481,2121005,1,JulenGarmendia,25/07/2022,"We spent 2 nights for €5. Overnight they changed the price to 50€...very expensive, there is no service. Next to 2 syringes. Town 20 minutes away.

They are really lovely! they don't do anything Cheer up!!"
18481,2108936,3,jordi_284,22/07/2022,"everyone with table and chairs outside and no problem, including open awnings. A lot of truckers pissing and shitting in the bushes, a disaster."

18481,2041490,2,David-P-49,05/07/2022,"I think that for 10€, the restaurant that collects the car park could at least give a discount on the price of the menu, especially to be in the dust, even if it's 300m from Casa Dali. The city is superb. *I confirm the presence of a family of wild pigs (2 adults 4 small), which is not aggressive."

Nice acquaintances with the neighbors. Speaking of neighbors: Wild boars often visit you and ask for food. But they were quite tame. Negative: the place is unfortunately very dirty due to the high level of tourism. Please take your rubbish back with you.

18481,1598248,3,SiraQuiroga,21/09/2021,"Quiet to spend the night, one of the few possible places in the area. For the rest, it is still a dirt parking lot with absolutely nothing, they even close the tap of the water tap (and there is no where to refuel in the area).

The chiringuito at the entrance manages the collection (in our case, 5 euros for a van), although a man passes first thing in the morning noting registration plates to collect.

A man in town hall bibs at the entrance charges regardless of what you are going to be. Unfortunately the only site enabled for motorhomes in the area, so you have to go through the hoop if you want to visit Cadaqués. Next to the Dalí house and about 15-20min. walking from town."

The only downside is that when there is a tramuntana, everything gets dusty. Very quiet at night. I don't give it 5 stars for the dusty floor, but in the area you can't ask for more."
18481,1365731,3,verito84,26/07/2021,"At the entrance there is a boy who charged us 10 euros to be able to spend the night with the van, little shade, tables and chairs can be taken out, there are two beach bars next to it, a beach that we did not like at all, dirty water, having those pieces Coves in Costa Brava is not worth it. We slept with a lot of vans and c. Apparently it is the only legal site nearby to pecnore."
18481,1360616,5,DavidRabasa,24/07/2021,"An excellent option in an area that is more than complicated to spend the night, even with the dust that the north wind raises, you feel like having a morning bath just like Salvador Dali did to get your inspiration."

We called the Local Police and they made it clear that it was forbidden to spend the night in the town hall and they advised us to go to this car park. € 10 to park in a dusty place without any service. Between 10pm and 0am more vans and acs were appearing en masse in the car park, all alerted by local police."

City center 15 minutes from Cadaques. Most in the evening the wild boars are out between the campsites because they are harmless to eat.

18481,1291869,5,cliffteam,02/07/2021,"We really stood here very comfortably. About 20 other campers stood around us. It makes sense to have a few wedges with you. The place is slightly sloping. In the evening the wild boars actually came by. The animals are quite interested in people and are not shy about them. At the stand you can rent kayaks, which is apparently very popular."
18481,1290126,4,Vercegentorix,02/07/2021,The site is very quiet. Too much dust is raised when air is blowing. the funny point was the appearance of a wild boar at dinner time. He walked around looking for scraps of food and left

They are € 5 for vans and € 10 for AC. We felt pretty safe, the atmosphere was very good. It is right next to the beach and two beach bars. Fun fact: there were wild boars."

18481,1265817,4,Kenny_castil,20/06/2021,"Large dirt campsite. There were wild boars in the late evening, as in Cadaqués town. Being low season they have not charged us for parking. The town of Cadaqués is a 20-minute walk away. In the parking there is a beach bar."

In fact, they have had to remove awnings, tables, etc., for having passed the municipal to give the touch. For things like that these types of places are lost."
18481,1251326,4,MayaJaviMarta,12/06/2021,"Next to the beach, dirt parking, restaurant open until 11:24 pm in summer. Very close to Cadaques. There are containers in the same parking lot, however you see garbage on the perimeter, I don't understand it. They will end up placing a sign forbidden to stay overnight."
18481,1246339,4,monburstner2020,10/06/2021,"Clean, quiet place, very close to Lligat beach where you can eat. It is 5 minutes from the house of S. Dali, 20 minutes on foot from the center of Cadaqués. We did not pay anything at the beginning of June but normally the price is 10 €. We were visited by a herd of goats and 3 harmless wild boars.

Later we began to hear screams and we saw a bigger wild boar, which was facing people and trying to enter the fires ... we lived it ourselves. Along with many other campers, we had to go find another place in Roses."
18481,1239391,5,davidalsinamercier,06/06/2021,"We pay € 5 with camper. Very good atmosphere, families and nice people. Perfect to go with dogs; They are not allowed on the beach but many people wear them and nobody says anything."
18481,1232727,4,Labarje,02/06/2021,"Ideal location to park and spend a night in Cadaques, very close to Dali's house. To get there, follow the P4 car park when entering Cadaques. A few wild boars can come and keep you company, and prowl around the garbage cans at night. To get to Cap de Creus. It is necessary to have a free authorization from the Guardia Civil de Cadaques to access and park in a motorhome under penalty of a heavy fine."
18481,1210005,1,luluigini,22/05/2021,"Really nice place and big parking lot. Unfortunately overcrowded with campers, loud, even more people due to a bar right on the parking lot. Unfortunately, everyone urinates and sits in the corners. Some wild boars ran around but were calm. Very windy and a mile-long, curvy stretch to reach the place but is definitely doable. The police came at around 11 p.m. and checked some mobile homes due to Covid 19 and the many people. We went on in the morning to have breakfast in a quieter place."

We didn't pay anything, it's low season, it doesn't have services."
18481,1083529,5,evamariaestrada,06/10/2020,"Perfect for spending the night, even taking out a table and chairs to eat while you sunbathe. At the tourist office they told us that they only charge if the beach bar right at the entrance is open (high season). There were many vans and AC and we slept without noise.

Comfortable to see the area without having to move the vehicle. We have met the wild boars that probably live long before the people around here. The only thing we see is that due to the influx there is and the number of vehicles that park, some municipal work toilets would be more than useful as well as necessary"

The only downside, the incivility of the people, at so many at night children shouting among the motorhomes, and the last straw when some wild boars appeared, they dedicated themselves to running after them, children and not so children as if they were the Sanfermines ... please, a little civility! They do not allow us to spend the night in the entire cap de creus, it is in one of the few places that can be done and if we continue like this it will last 2 days"

The car park is busy on sunny days for the beach but empties quickly around 7 p.m. offering places in front of the ocean. Very calm, cradled by the waves and the Nalu Quinta restaurant to the right of the parking lot towards Figueira is really good and nice for a sunset;)"

There are other Acs parked and staying overnight in the area. At 11:30 p.m. we moved to some nearby streets due to the noise of an engine running since 8:00 p.m. (probably from a fishing boat)

To occupy the motorhome spaces you have to go to the ""pool cafe"" which is relatively close, they give you a key.

18712,178603,5,SiraQuiroga,18/08/2017,"Perfect place to spend the night and to spend a couple of quiet days, right next to the pool (small but enough for the people who come, with grass and shade). Chiringuito with some portions. Especially super quiet night under a beautiful starry sky."
18712,126156,5,lambefire,09/04/2017,Parking next to the natural pool very quiet. Shaded area and with a source of drinking water perfect to use. Very good place to spend the night.
18763,3251272,5,gasoalhambra,02/09/2023,"It is very good at the back, it has an exit to the beach and we were with bicycles in Casares Costa Los Baños, well recommended, totally"
18763,3238941,4,yoguini,30/08/2023,"For a 4-star hotel, it doesn't seem excessively expensive in high season. Spacious plot, with electricity, water and gray outlet included and the same individual. First line of beach. Dark sand typical of the Malaga area. The spacious bathrooms remind me of those in a spa, it's true that they could have fewer relief problems... that takes them down a star. Beach bar area nearby, good bike ride and we will see the nightlife. I would spend at least 4/5 days here quietly. €42 per night on a large/deluxe plot"
18763,3100722,5,juanjo45,08/08/2023,"It is very quiet, it is on the beachfront. There is a rather small pool, there is an ice cream and potato kiosk. The town is great and the people at the campsite are very good. We will go again."
18763,3047134,3,erperi14,30/07/2023,"Camping on the beach, quite large pitches but with little shade, it is quite expensive 42 e for one night. The pool is ridiculous, too small for a campsite with 145 pitches. the hours are a bit strange, shop and bar close at 8 pm."
18763,2853728,5,chrirogater,14/06/2023,"Booked 7 nights. The beach is nice but the rest of the direct area boring and dirty (you dont notice on the camping). It is a 15-30 minuted walk along the beach and then there are many restaurants and stores for daily need. Large facilites, small pool. 

Hint: Check pitches with the camping website plus google satellite to see which pitch is shady, as some are quite new and have only small trees."
18763,2842418,5,FaEli,11/06/2023,"8.5m in 4/6/2023 out 8/6/2023. 34€ per night with electricity. Nice campsite with direct access to the beach (grey sand). Large pitches, equipped with electricity, water supply and gray water discharge (it is necessary to have a roll tank or bucket to use it). Excellent washing machines and bathrooms, even if some showers need to be rearranged. Narrow internal roads for long campers, but not problematic"
18763,2802406,4,Ambrogio90s,30/05/2023,Nice camp site in front of the beach. Unsure how the restaurant works as the timetable isn’t really respected maybe due to low season. Chirinquito right outside the camp site on the beach is a great alternative. Good services
18763,2792857,3,petervonfrosta,27/05/2023,For one night ok but not more. Very loud music from the own bar and bawling guests who drink until late at night like crazy. The only good thing is the close proximity to the sea. The pool stinks 100m upwind.
18763,2779289,5,lisabe29,23/05/2023,"Dream campsite in our eyes. We stood with a sea view, access to the beach directly from the campsite. Professional check in, there is a shop and a restaurant. Sanitary facilities very modern, well maintained and clean. showers very large. We felt very comfortable and were able to watch the beautiful sunrise! We would recommend it to everyone!"
18763,2772927,4,vanlife1409,21/05/2023,Nice campsite right near the beach. A bit noisy at night due to some club nearby.
18763,2753471,4,dana1991,16/05/2023,plus: * large pitches with lots of privacy and water point at every pitch * location right on the beach * swimming pool * modern and clean sanitary facilities * friendly staff minus: * loud live music at weekends * many permanent pitches making it seem to be a Gypsy Park * very many dogs that pee against the hedges and shit on the beach
18763,2751512,4,Anniesway,15/05/2023,"Great campsite if you want to spend a few days at the beach. The campsite is mainly filled by Englishmen with permanent pitches. Plumbing is ok, but could be cleaner."
18763,2741074,5,felix1412,11/05/2023,"WOW! This is a beautiful site, spacious pitches with water waste and ehu, toilets and showers are big and spotless, shop selling all necessities, bar/restaurant, pool and beach access, loving it!"
18763,2723463,5,Den_Twan,04/05/2023,Large and beautifully maintained campsite. Friendly at the reception and English speaking. Shop at the campsite with sandwiches. Places slightly inclined. Nice clean sanitary facilities. Beautiful swimming pool. Located on the A7 but not much affected by .. I definitely recommend this place
18763,2704879,5,Greenvale999,29/04/2023,"Fantastic site, picked a pitch right at the beach front very private. individual electrical point, water and grey waste. Excellent staff, shower/toilet block immaculate. Entertainment every weekend, amazing restaurant and bar, small pool and direct gates access to beach. Site very well maintained and def worth a visit. Long boardwalk along beach to all the bars and restaurants you will ever need."
18763,2699915,5,felinak,27/04/2023,"Nice place with direct access to the beach. If you're quick, you'll get a seat with a sea view. Good toilets and showers. The place is not very big, but you have everything you need. You can hear the street at night but we only stayed one night. 31€ for one night with electricity, great."
18763,2663968,4,familieBenkouri,12/04/2023,Sanitary facilities are clean and generously equipped. The place is small but cute. Direct access to the sea and a small pool. Kiosk with the essentials and friendly staff.
18763,2639395,3,Barnie2007,04/04/2023,"The best thing was that the place is right by the sea, otherwise the campsite leaves a rather careless impression. The pitches do not allow for any privacy and during the day you will hear music playing. Sanitary facilities were good and the staff nice therefore 3 stars"
18763,2561924,2,CaptainRichi,27/01/2023,"€5 to empty our toilets and fill up with water otherwise €34 for one night, tight as sardines"
18763,2561718,2,Beckydawson,27/01/2023,unfortunately had to park close to road and so noisy didn't sleep. also found checking in staff very rude
18763,2536519,5,GertAbby,01/01/2023,"Great campsite ! Beautiful large well-kept places. Everything in perfect order and shady in summer. Plus, right on the beach! The disadvantage is that there is not much to do in the area and that the restaurants have abysmal service in Manilva. But this beautiful campsite can't help that."
18763,2530196,5,sjmotorhome,27/12/2022,"Just spent a wonder 5 nights over Christmas here, such a great place a location. We was sorry to leave. Facilities are great, no complaints at all. We will try and hook longer next time. 5 stars"
18763,2489068,5,Dieter8888,09/11/2022,"I agree. The best place I've seen in Spain. It's worth the price. New sanitary facilities and restaurant, clean and more than adequate with us. One of the few places between the N340/A7 and the beach. Therefore a little noisy."
18763,2468886,1,MaPrts,29/10/2022,"Value for money is really a disaster. Parcels small, a lot of rubbish (cigarette butts, cans, paper...) Many older people with long-term stays very child-unfriendly, possessive and loud. The sanitary facilities are dirty and in need of renovation, for example. many clogged showers. Overall, despite the location as a family, there is no joy at all. No recommendation."
18763,2441501,3,Tomkt22,13/10/2022,Pleasant enough beach stopover. Quite pricey. Music in the bar & vibe too much like England on sea…
18763,2424309,4,lola2022,05/10/2022,"Positive: Large pitches with electricity and their own water V/E, direct access to the beach, beautiful beach (with small stones), beautiful beach promenade with restaurants within walking distance, nice service, fresh baguettes in the morning, good washing machines, Eroski nearby — Negative: large near the road, modern sanitary facilities, which are unfortunately in the basement and poorly ventilated (but mostly clean)"
18763,2405196,3,julielkmoore,26/09/2022,"One of the best camp sites we have visited in spain in terms of location, facilities, beach and pool. This is our 3rd time and we left a day early having paid for it as the noise from loud inconsiderate neighbour’s was incredible. This site needs a quiet time policy or if it has one, it needs to enforce the rules more, including kids going mad on bikes and scooters. Shame as it’s a nice site."
18763,2389641,4,yeahbuddy,20/09/2022,"Made a small stop here in the fall to fill up and drain water. - Plant small but nice - Sanitary facilities relatively nice. - Showers with a strong jet - Beach clean and huge - 8-ung for fresh water... You need your own hose, since there is only one water tap per plot. Staff experienced very friendly and helpful."
18763,2375940,5,IsabelCharra,16/09/2022,"Super recommended campsite. On the beachfront, with all the services and quite clean. Isaac, the bartender at the beach bar, is super friendly! To put some downside, it has few shadows."
18763,2375630,3,nievesconde,16/09/2022,"very short hose to refill water, you have to hit a lot or have a good hose. To dispose of gray water, you also need a hose, since it is a grid in a corner and we did not have a special hose for it, we had to eliminate it in buckets. We came here to be able to change waters and refill since we delivered the caravan at 9.30 am and it disappoints. Side road, lots of car noise."
18763,2188154,3,maiholsak,07/08/2022,"The place is ok. It is large and has good toilet and bathing facilities. Lovely close to the beach. The restaurant is terrible, it looks so nice but we had to go up and order ourselves as they wouldn't take orders at the tables and we got 2 pizzas that were definitely not made at the restaurant but rather bought in Lidl and thrown away in an oven. Ouch that was bad."
18763,2116205,5,mariemauro,24/07/2022,Direct access to the beach and swimming pool within the campsite. Spotless bathrooms and showers. Good room for maneuver. Large pitches with water and electricity. Restaurant inside.
18763,2106272,2,michaellas,22/07/2022,"The only thing I liked about this campsite was the friendly staff at the reception. The campsite was too small, no shade, one next to the other. Absolutely no privacy."
18763,2050059,4,CarolavdG,08/07/2022,"Basically a beautiful campsite with excellent sanitary facilities and directly on the beach. However, lack of maintenance. Water in the shower did not drain. Places are not cleaned sufficiently before the next guest arrives. Our place was next to garden waste full of plastic, paper etc. Lady at the reception was also very friendly. Campsite is located on a busy road where you can also hear the cars at night."
18763,2045417,2,bikefire,07/07/2022,"Small campsite for an AC 7.5m. Difficult maneuver and fair seats. Noise from rude tenants, also road noise. Access to the beach is good, it has a small pool, restaurant, bar. Underground but clean toilets and showers. Expensive, 3 people €92 x2 nights light included. Water on the plot, gray with a bucket, black in the same place and the same tap for everything."
18763,2010172,3,carlosutrera,25/06/2022,Close to the beach and with a swimming pool. Very calm. Small pitches to manoeuvre. Stone floor and not cleaned. Hardly any shade. Highway 50 meters with a lot of traffic. Bar closes at 23.00. Almost all customers are foreigners.
18763,1984032,3,SebiMercy,17/06/2022,"Right on the beach, €29 for 2 people with electricity. Very small plots and sanitary facilities, although clean but far away. Fine as a stopover."
18763,1982231,5,Crafter2014,16/06/2022,great place with everything you need.
18763,1939508,5,SaritaTamara,02/06/2022,"Finally a place where you can see the sea from the pitch and get there in a towel in 3 minutes. Generous sanitary area with baby and family bath. The slightly higher price is also worth it, but definitely within reason. We only wanted to stay one night, so we extended."
18763,1896323,4,ThunderAl,17/05/2022,"nice quiet campsite, but not very cheap (38€/night for 2 adults and a child). sanitary facilities well maintained and clean. small supermarket. playground available. nice pool that is a bit old. only separated from the sea by a beach promenade and a fence."
18763,1876695,3,marloucl66,08/05/2022,"Very expensive: 38€ for CC, 2 people +2 small dogs. Better to be English or Spanish...no drain. Lots of residents. Placed beside road, no place to walk around, night is short with vehicle noise. Departure before 12 noon whatever the time of arrival."
18763,1874692,4,HetzmannJean,07/05/2022,very good clean quiet campsite super clean toilets for washing dishes washing up etc beautiful places close to the sea The price is justified in relation to all the services
18763,1846349,3,reisefreak1,22/04/2022,"We were here 2 days; the system is really very comfortably equipped and ideal for those who spend the winter with a long waste water hose! Access to the well-kept beach, ideal for SUP, surfing, etc. The nearby motorway does not bother you. Disadvantages: high price (32€/2 people/day) and no central gray water disposal. I should dump my gray water in the gully at the entrance! Therefore 2 stars deduction."
18763,1806657,3,Leslobs3,04/04/2022,"Campsite located on the seafront, near the port with a beautiful marina. At 35€ for 1 van, 2 people and 1 dog, we only stayed one night"
18763,1784077,3,DrazenBilic,15/03/2022,We paid around 35€ for a night/motorhome 2/adults and 2/kids. Felt like camping in UK. Most of the guests are retired UK and Scandinavian people. Generally OK camp spot if your up for it.
18763,1775557,5,HindrekSepp,06/03/2022,very hard place. If you can get here. All the time full of bronze and completely understandable.
18763,1772270,1,EfratKimhi,03/03/2022,"They asked for 50 Euro per night on low season!!! 
We left"
18763,1752571,4,Tatie333,11/02/2022,"Very nice campsite, large pitch of around 70m2 with water, electricity, very clean sanitary waste water evacuation"
18763,1747116,1,Spitzbubi,04/02/2022,"Unfortunately no service for ""external"" only toilet disposal for 5 €, somehow unfriendly."
18763,1744456,4,Ralf0815,30/01/2022,"A very good site, clean modern toilet facilities, spacious pitches, right by the sea. Differs positively from the usual partially scruffy places in Spain! There are only compromises to be made in terms of the weather, mostly a permanent stormy wind, unfortunately...."
18763,1738451,4,Hubertistunterwegs,21/01/2022,"Huge campsite with a lot of camper vans - one bigger than the other. Almost fully booked. Sanitary rooms were clean. We had a parcel as near as possible to the beach being surrounded by the smaller vans. At the port from Manilva there are a few restaurants. Nothing special, but okay for a few nights."
18763,1732486,4,Brilisad,12/01/2022,"Pitches with hedges. Very clean sanitary facilities. On the edge of the beach, a well-maintained swimming pool (unfortunately a bit cold for us), with comfortable deckchairs in the sun. Very nice restaurant and bar we enjoyed Sangria and meals. Possibility to ride by bike or on foot on the seaside promenade. We will come back despite the background noise of the road"
18763,1729942,5,UweRommel,08/01/2022,"Great campsite, great sanitary facilities, direct access to the beach. For big ships, it gets tight with maneuvering."
18763,1727119,3,MariellaRuijsch,05/01/2022,Nice campsite right on the beach. Not big places but spacious enough. Sanitary is fine and clean. The village is 10 minutes away via a path along the beach and the harbor is 15 minutes away on foot. There are plenty of bars and restaurants on the harbour. Only downside is that the traffic from the road can be heard very well. Also an expensive campsite with 35 euros for 1 night.
18763,1692744,4,dominiquechevrete,19/11/2021,Great comfort water and electricity at each location near the beach and bike path excellent restaurant luxury sanitary facilities I will come back
18763,1658807,3,jeffsadventure,23/10/2021,"Nice and simple reception, well located. VE is only to be used at every parking space if you have meter-long hoses with you. Otherwise there is no disposal. Showers are actually modern, but urgently need maintenance (hot water is only partially possible and cleanliness is just okay)."
18763,1646059,1,nive,15/10/2021,Too bad do not like the French because camping near the beach dirty site and supposedly luxury site while we were on a tent site
18763,1625063,4,sjmotorhome,03/10/2021,"A fantastic site, well looked after. Everything was great, on the beach & lovely pool. Amazing showers etc. The only negative we had, so many young children & screaming & crying, also speed round on electric scooters. Not safe they need to stop that. If it was adults only I would of given 5 star."
18763,1608397,4,bomair57,25/09/2021,"A lot of quality, everything very structured, it is allowed, little noise, for those who seek tranquility it is a luxury, beach of 10. Perhaps some noise from the road, but nothing excessive. The exterior walk is wonderful. Something high in price, but it gives a plus that is not normally given. I will repeat."
18763,1568186,5,flosspops,11/09/2021,"Great site 2nd stay here ,everything you need absolutely spotless  , good size pitches , close to restaurants bars & shops great for bikes €31 for 2 p motorhome with dog ."
18763,1429875,1,vax69,09/08/2021,"Without reservation, in August you cannot enter this campsite. The only place in all of Spain that bounced me off without even offering me an alternative."
18763,1413345,4,Thork,06/08/2021,"Nice. In front of the beach. We spent 1 day, 3 people for 46€, pre-booked or we wouldn't have a seat."
18763,1372455,5,javipolvo,27/07/2021,"SPECTACULAR ... I HAVE NO WORDS. Incredible deal, large plots with light, wifi water and emptying of blacks on the plot, difficult to reserve because of how good it is, beach on the first line, nice and cozy town, very quiet and clean camping of 10"
18763,1332426,4,lolaytal,17/07/2021,"Very large plot delimited with hedges and with all services included in it. I do not put the 5 * because it is located next to a highway and there is a lot of noise during the day, at night you sleep well. Right on the beach. It is not cheap or expensive camping, the price seems fair to me for what I offer. Due to the pandemic there are limitations in some services. By the way, bread is bad"
18763,1227033,4,solrrak,30/05/2021,"Camping with good facilities, although very noisy, we have been two nights in May that should be quiet and they have had us all weekend with orchestras and performances at full volume were heard throughout the campsite, it is not camping if you are looking for tranquility."
18763,1137703,5,DonKubito,15/02/2021,"Probably the best camping / camper park in the area. Great services, helpful staff & prime location. Bit pricey though ;)"
18763,1136398,5,Isali_97,10/02/2021,"We stood on the square for five days in mid-January. The sanitary facilities were great - clean, spacious and chic. Friendly staff and lots of nice long-term campers (mainly English and a few German) We stood on one of the smaller places with a direct view of the sea. We liked it!"
18763,1131991,4,lebefitter,21/01/2021,"We got a special price 5 nights for 96 €. Without this offer we would not have visited the place as 32 € per night would be way too much. The guest wifi cannot be used, we received the VIP wifi free of charge. Sanitary facilities are showing their age, but clean. There is no gray water emptying. You can hear some street noise at night. Otherwise everything was great."
18763,1127612,3,HJHaerter,03/01/2021,"Was here a few days and paid 31 euros in 2020 and 32 euros from 2021. The showers are large and clean, but at 32 euros I expect that too. Unfortunately, the restaurant was also closed and I had to go to the marina to eat. Dogs are charged at 3 euros per day."
18763,1086779,2,JulianLove,09/10/2020,"We visited in 2017 and the site was clean and appeared to be well maintained. We are now here in 2020 and what a difference. Reception staff are rude, want vehicle insurance, why? This place is not cheap either at €31 per night with EHU. Lots of services advertised are not available or closed. Family toilets and showers, pool bar, restaurant etc. Free WiFi non existent. Untidy plots, many with dripping taps. The whole place now seems like it needs a lot of maintenance and staff training wouldn’t be a bad idea either!"
18763,1016381,1,famdamgo,31/08/2020,Good location good facilities but the requirements to enter too many ask you for vehicle insurance to be able to stay
18763,1016377,2,famdamgo,31/08/2020,"The price is not cheap, let's say the strict anti-Covid regulations are very good, but they require you to present the insurance of the vehicle with which you go, I do not know if it will be legal but it is nonsense and the security leaves much to be desired I do not recommend it"
18763,963044,4,soky,14/08/2020,"For the price it has, we expected something more, camping on a plot of earth and stones ... it fills everything with dust, it does not have recycling bins, the anti-Covid measures, well we have seen better ... The playground something dirty ... Otherwise the best bathrooms ... clean and spacious and the swimming pool I can't speak because we couldn't get in since they were all busy ... it looked good to be with children. with direct access to the beach."
18763,941630,5,ALIRDAJI,09/08/2020,"We were looking for tranquility and everything we wanted was this campsite, beach, swimming pool, nearby restaurants and a very long promenade. Very good camping, a lot of hygiene and everything within three steps. As for the price 1 motorhome and 2 adults € 39 per day, expensive or cheap ..... it met our expectations and we were satisfied."
18763,927616,5,antoniolomas,04/08/2020,"Very good place to spend a few nights narrow streets but enough to ac very large plots with water outlets, gray (take a hose to fill and empty), electricity, TV good shadows on the beach and pool with a poolside snack bar Good very new services and I liked a good restaurant, neither expensive nor cheap price € 38 per day two adults a child and motorhome."
18763,853957,1,jaimemsb,07/07/2020,"Very expensive campsite (€ 45 car + 2 adults + 2 children), since they do not give any extra services like others, although it says it is first class, it leaves a lot to be desired. There were dog poops on the plot. It does not have a gray discharge area, they tell you to throw it in a sewer near the black room. The black waters are at the exit of the campsite. They don't have yellow plastic bins to recycle or at least I didn't see them. Another campsite that has not adapted to motorhomes who do not want to use the facilities and charge us for them. In the days that I have been I have not used either the bathrooms or showers ..."
18763,836875,1,Anus,26/06/2020,"The squares are delimited by vegetation although in some places plants are missing. The squares are gravel, you can hear a lot of the noise of cars on the road, in summer children are noisy, and also some adults, they do not respect rest. The beach does not allow dogs, although it does admit people who throw trash on the ground. It is a campsite where most are caravans and camping tents."
18763,807294,5,jeangrindu,23/05/2020,Arrived at the campsite without appointment. very well received by the caretaker. we stayed 10 days. I recommend it. a bit far but to visit the southern region of Spain great.

18763,717624,4,Domitineo31,10/10/2019,"Quiet out of season except the 4 lanes, which fades at night, the site is well maintained, clean pool because less solicited mid-October. Modern sanitary facilities and super-clean, 31 euros camper + 2 people + a dog the night. I recommend for a step."
18763,567034,4,flo.odie,21/07/2019,"This campsite is very well equipped for motorhomes, there is direct access to the beach, sanitary are recent and clean, it is a pity that the pool is so small and the water little maintained."
18763,523145,3,paganx,21/06/2019,"Campsite totally overpriced in low season, stood by the road 37 euros per night for 2 adults and 1 child with van. The place was otherwise clean and well maintained. Sanitary super. Swimming on the beach for small children almost impossible, as it drops steeply. Small pool."
18763,482363,4,seelenverwandt,12/05/2019,"Everything was super clean, places nicely laid out, unfortunately a great many Brits, who behave in part as if there were only them"
18763,410634,5,vandiesel,28/11/2018,"Great campsite, definitely a brutish expat destination. Amazing hot showers with great shower pressure. Lots of family shower rooms, excellent baby bath facilities. Pitches clean, shaded. Direct accès to the beach. Pricey, but there is nothing else’ around. Paid €37 for one night with campervan, 2 kids, 2 adults and a dog. All services included in price."

18794,95545,5,Victor1,16/08/2016,"We spent the night in this fantastic place and this morning we received an environmental agent telling us that we had to fine because according to him, the campsite is less than one km away and that we already knew. The owner of the campsite reports all the mornings of the motorhomes and incidents that he considers appropriate and reports them. That campsite, less than a km away, is the Urbion campsite. I hope that environmental agent dedicates himself to denouncing all those who throw cans, plastics, papers, and all kinds of waste in this place and leave us quiet to those who respect nature and are only reported only for sleeping. Whoever wants to check the trash I mentioned just have to come and have a look. It's a shame and a nonsense about this whole thing. We're leaving here and of course I will not go to that campsite."
