103424,2488403,5,cb0210,09/11/2022,"Small spot perfect for a night, very quiet, flat land and a nice view when you wake up! We did not stay long but there are certainly beautiful walks to do!"
103424,1776016,5,Luna45,06/03/2022,"A very quiet place. Despite the animals nearby, they were not heard all night. The views from the car park may not be as impressive as other places, but I would definitely spend the night here again. If you go on a route, there are trails a few minutes away by car with very nice views. We did several from the Fuente de los 100 Caños."
103424,1709082,5,emilysummers,12/12/2021,"There is parking in front of the chapel, or drive just past it to the back and theres a large flat area as well. I swear I had the best sleep Ive had on my whole trip, super quiet and peaceful"
103424,1708216,4,BGdu86,11/12/2021,"Quiet corner, a few passages in the evening but quiet night"
103424,1667275,4,CapybaraBoomBoom,29/10/2021,"Surrounded by houses, and road / farming activity, but very calm at night. The place does feel safe, the chapel brings it a good aura, and I was not disturbed by anyone although quite a few locals passed by (in cars). It's actually quite nice. Everyone don't leave any slightest bit of your trash anywhere please come on let's be responsible !"
103424,1634237,5,MonicaTirado,09/10/2021,"Shaded level esplanade, next to a hermitage. He sleeps peacefully, no noise, nearby dogs do not bark at night. No service."
103424,1510908,5,Josesantiago,25/08/2021,"Level, quiet and safe."
103424,1117358,4,drlbradley,24/11/2020,A good sized level place to park. We did speak to the home owner opposite when we arrived and he said ok to sleep there. Loads of dogs barking when we got here but surprisingly they didn’t bark all night. A good spot if you’re in need of a safe sleeping place
103424,993115,2,EddyEddy,22/08/2020,"Postive points: Feels safe, there is morning shade and there are great cycling roads nearby. Negative points: Houses close by, barking dogs and loud party music. But maybe I was unlucky (Saturday night)."
103424,615692,5,isabel_juan,10/08/2019,"Quiet, between the chapel and the brotherhood house. Even a man came to take something from the brotherhood and said nothing to us. While there with the table and chairs watching a series outside the van having dinner, another camper arrived to pecnoct without problems. Perfect to spend the night before arriving in Granada. There are no faucets / water or bathrooms."
103424,395481,4,zdouli,18/10/2018,"Exact location, Hermitage San Isidro, on the parking lot. quiet and welcoming neighborhood."
103428,2621672,4,parkhymervan,24/03/2023,"It's a disposal station, nothing more. Water can be refilled."

103428,2573940,3,egoman,10/02/2023,"To me it looks like a supply/disposal with no parking facilities. In any case, no parking spaces are designated. No other Womo there, then I drove on."
103428,1866527,4,JuanPedroMunozAntolinos,02/05/2022,Good initiative. the only bad thing is having to spend the night in the normal street and with some inclination. Better to stay in the parking museum and Cultural Center.
103428,1718982,4,Orca_ma,29/12/2021,Two places for emptying and filling. Overnight along the street in front of the houses. A little busy in the mornings but we have spent the night without problems. Very pretty town. Thanks to the city council for thinking of us
103428,1716014,4,Robuga,26/12/2021,"It is not a motorhome area as such, there are two spaces enabled for filling and emptying. You have space on the same street to park and spend the night, but it is a street. and cars pass. There is also the option of spending the night in the parking lot of the Museum of the First Settlers. It is flat, well located in front of the museum and next to the center and it is where the coaches park."
103428,1704748,4,jcsgalvez,06/12/2021,"Emptying and filling services. You have to park along the street, which is very quiet at this time. Ideal for strolling through the town and visiting the Alcazaba and the Museum of First Settlers. Grateful to the Orce City Council."

103428,1096817,5,Nomada54,17/10/2020,"A visit to this beautiful town is highly recommended, both to its museums, as well as the one that can be done guided to the Alcazaba of the 7 towers, Casa de los Segura and Church. Good Segureño lamb to taste. Thank you Orce because with your area you facilitate this visit to motorhomes"
103428,968373,4,cortinass,16/08/2020,The area is for filling and emptying. To sleep there is nothing marked and you do it at the sunset of several houses without knowing if the owners feel good or not. Anyway thanks to the town hall for the service
103428,836975,4,Beasty442,26/06/2020,We visited this site on 06/24/2020. The service point was clean and working.

103428,778383,5,agulinaress,09/02/2020,"We have slept a night without problems, the museum guide has told us that you can sleep in the whole street, which is thought so. The town is beautiful, and it is worth the guided tour of the Alcazaba. Fully recommended"
103428,744396,5,pilbalmag,17/11/2019,"Perfect place to fill and empty, quiet to spend the night. We recommend the pizzas of the restaurant La wicker that also put them to take away."
103428,698930,5,Mercadergr,21/09/2019,"Magnify It is an area of Services for Motorhomes (download of Grays, zone for blacks and water intake to fill). There are two motorhomes and the truth is that on dates like now we have stayed tonight in the same service area. In the morning we parked right next to it (in the street) under some trees and a park and from there we moved walking to see the town."
103428,661845,5,miguelmlajara,27/08/2019,"Excellent service area. It is not an area but in the tourist office they told us that we could park in the whole street where it is located that is quite long, wide and quiet."
103428,562372,5,laprivi,19/07/2019,Perfect facilities Comfortable and clean. Thanks to the city of Orce for this area!
103428,493355,5,pazpipi,26/05/2019,"I do not know why people who have been in this area say it is not for sleeping. We have been this weekend and although there are only 2 places you can sleep, for the day we have moved x if someone needs to change water we have spoken with the staff of the city council that devised it and have missed that comment. They thought about it for that. yes there are only 2 places"
103428,491081,4,Vaja,23/05/2019,It is only for water change and filling. To park you have to do it on the street
103428,443651,5,dvznh,23/03/2019,Perfect site for loading and unloading. 2 positions to be able to do it simultaneously. We spend the night in the same street in a flat area without problem.
103428,430781,5,Anus,18/02/2019,"It is not a parking area, but a place to change water, gray and black, and fill the drinking water tank, all for free, it is perfectly clean and accessible, a 10 for the town hall"
103432,2210204,1,Nippers,10/08/2022,"Very cool area, but you have to park on the side of the road."
103432,1955293,1,pit,07/06/2022,Flat to park but it is at the edge of the main road!
103432,1740790,3,camper010010,24/01/2022,We have spent one night there. We were quiet to sleep. The bad thing is that the road is next to it and cars pass by. There is a recreational area right next door.
103440,3142704,5,JoPel,14/08/2023,"Excellent views. Very quiet. A bit windy and a good 4G connection for digital nomads.
Good spot for birdwatching. Lammergeiers, vultures, eagles falcons and more."
103440,2447175,4,freesoulvan,16/10/2022,"Spectacular views, a place to have a kit kat since on weekends there is a lot of movement of people who go to Balandrau. Be careful with the road that for vans and tourism you have to be careful with how stony it is."
103440,1232431,5,Madmartigan,02/06/2021,"Good views, little parking space, with tables and chairs."
103440,532720,5,Jacques1604,29/06/2019,Very nice place with great views. Some ground clearance is an advantage. In the morning it can happen that cows come to visit :)
103440,412347,1,CapuchaVerde,06/12/2018,There is parking for motorhomes and access is horrible.
103440,380643,4,Llopis,23/09/2018,"Beautiful views, but with little open ground and little shade"

103464,1695365,5,txampe,22/11/2021,"Spectacular site without any type of service enabled for motorhomes (saved by a fountain), it is only a natural space that those of us who like the mountains and tranquility value very much. Let's take care of these sites"
103464,1637714,4,RPB81,10/10/2021,"Very quiet place to spend the night even on a small road. Water fountain, tables and trash can. At night, yes, the bells of the cows are heard."
103464,1570766,5,Trinity42,12/09/2021,"Incredible site. Mountain area, with a very little traveled road. Barbecues, stone tables, and tons of wooded space to park. A quiet, well-kept environment, very open and the views of the best. We were this Saturday, September 11, 2021 ... passing the day, we will return to spend the night some weekend, for sure !!"
103464,1552028,5,rebvdv,06/09/2021,We spent the night there. Flat land and beautiful view of the mountain. There is a road nearby but it is very little used.
103464,1469776,5,vanGRsun,17/08/2021,View of the mountains. Calm and peaceful. Good access. Flat location. Possibility of making a bbq (several locations with grid). Departure of several hikes. Water fountain.
103464,1373664,5,SLLS,28/07/2021,"We spent the night. People in the area have informed us that people spend the night there on weekends and that in principle it is a safe area. There are tables, barbecues and water."
103464,1280002,5,Tierras_Insolitas,27/06/2021,We spent one night and very quiet to sleep. Although it is on the side of the road at night there is no vehicle traffic. The whole area is lawned and there are picnic tables.

103464,1168471,4,ArturoVitoria,05/04/2021,"A good place. Beautiful environment. Although on specific dates, too many people."
103464,1167486,5,POSTA,05/04/2021,"The place is well worth it, there are quite a few people."
103464,1161334,5,pastun,30/03/2021,Very handsome
103464,1053649,5,lannister62,17/09/2020,"At the edge of a road but with very little traffic. Several barbecues available, picnic tables. Relatively flat location, on the left a little further. We slept well, very quiet."
103464,936447,4,Trochitas,07/08/2020,"The nearby fountain was dry and some car movement until 1:30, rare for a Thursday. Otherwise perfect for sleeping and picnic area."
103464,879663,5,martiasi,19/07/2020,A quiet and suitable place for mountain outings.
103464,531447,5,alexbilbo,28/06/2019,Very nice area to spend the night. Very quiet and with very good views. Road very little traffic. possibility of routes through Mt. 4 camper in weekend of June.
103464,396201,5,spidy,20/10/2018,A good place to stop and rest. Near the Tologorri route. Recommendable.
103470,3247827,4,Pat4Camp,01/09/2023,"Great tip with the official building at the top of the parking lot! We stood for one night and had a good night. A bit noisy from the nearby drawbridge and car noise but hey, really close to the city!"
103470,2148662,5,lapassionita,31/07/2022,"A little tip... right in front of the school at the entrance there are two parking bays. Here you can also stand up straight with larger mobile homes and enjoy the view over Porto. Quiet, bright and it should be holidays :). nice again"
103470,2090734,1,cobra,18/07/2022,"Proven traffic, broken cars, I didn't stay there 3min and given the area below, you quickly understand. I advise against"
103470,2004677,1,Nedu,23/06/2022,We spent a few hours in Porto. We parked right at the spot in the photo in the morning. When we got back they had forced a window and turned everything upside down. They tried to take the television but they only managed to break the arm. We denounced and they told us that it was a transit area for drug sales. I have little desire to visit Porto in AC
103470,1719230,3,carlosarda19,29/12/2021,"My opinion is that it is not an ideal place to leave an AC with valuables ... Otherwise everything perfect, we went to the center and about 15.20 minutes walk. I would not spend the night here."
103470,1268623,3,kangoo1606,21/06/2021,"We parked in the parking lot just above. Very large and free, 20 minutes walk from the city center. Beautiful panorama. The trip is very pleasant, along the river. We take away two stars because: no 24 hour sanitary facilities nor showers / many people arriving in the morning from 8 am. PS: there are toilets and running water in the cemetery (open during the day)."
103470,856774,3,Milano1992,09/07/2020,"The parking lot is near the old town, so it was easy to reach on foot. The residential area by the parking lot looks a bit poor, there are no toilets or showers, so we decided not to stay there. Recommended for a nice evening in the old town."
103470,469641,1,stetro,27/04/2019,Broken window and robbed during daytime
103470,469481,1,AnneZwitschert,27/04/2019,Disc hit and stolen valuables when we were in town over the day.
103470,466345,4,MaudAlain,24/04/2019,We stayed there just the day. Very good for visiting Porto.
103470,447116,4,JojoA,31/03/2019,We stayed here for one night from Friday to Saturday. Many days come and go on Friday because of the school / sports center. Very calm on Saturday. The space is tight and the floor uneven. About twenty minutes from the attractions of Porto. There is a small laundry on this street. The only downside here is the amount of excrement on the floor.
103486,3147917,5,Lufesa,14/08/2023,"Very quiet at night, further on there are more spaces where there were several vans, but this one is flatter and right in front of a small beach. Please! Let's leave the places clean!"
103486,3144122,4,vwafrica,14/08/2023,"Great location! Sheltered from the wind, very quiet, a few joggers or walkers but very friendly. Close to a very beautiful little cove. Only downside as usual, cleanliness, it would be nice if people pick up their toilet paper!"
103486,2261523,5,alibrlt,18/08/2022,"We were a few vans, the view is magnificent and it's very quiet. We ate at Péniche (30mn walk)"
103486,2206842,5,AntoRld,09/08/2022,"A spot already taken, but by following the coastal path a little, we found another nice place, there were already quite a few Vans and everyone found their place while keeping a distance of privacy. Really I recommend"
103486,1791657,1,aleberre,22/03/2022,the entrance to the path is inaccessible.
103486,1742458,4,BexNMex,27/01/2022,"dirt track to access has lots of pot holes but is doable. some nice sheltered, mostly flat places, stayed 2 nights with no problems"
103486,1696032,5,ClaudiSara,22/11/2021,"Really nice, steep driveway for VW buses but not for campers. Quiet without anything. Really relaxed. (We stayed 1 night in T6)"
103486,1680424,5,Nadjaonadventure,06/11/2021,"Slept here last night among the bamboos on the side of the path. It was absolutely peaceful, sheltered from the wind and a good place to sleep in. Unfortunately, it is not possible to drive here with a normal camper via the first street. I therefore recommend driving here from the second path on the left. That went without any difficulties. In the bay in the picture there is no beach as I thought."
103486,1403599,5,martalandesa,04/08/2021,We spent two nights with the van and it was great
103486,1372332,5,hannakeller,27/07/2021,"Stony path down, space for 2-3 campers. But if you drive further up there are always indentations where you can stand. Nice bay and no problems with the police, the people who walked by were all very nice"
103486,957157,5,karlMADDOX,13/08/2020,"Very nice little place for 1 or 2 nights. Very quiet for our taste. Ambient noise: lapping water in the cove, seagulls and light breeze from the bamboo trees lining the parking space. Passable but sandy road therefore deteriorates quickly. No bar limiting the height"
103486,786918,4,WeeRoam,26/02/2020,"Superb small cove, no other vehicle, we are not completely sheltered from the wind but this is not a problem. In the morning, locals walk their dog on the way, maybe a little too busy to stay several nights. The road has been upgraded, it is rather easy to access. There is a small convenience store nearby."
103486,771637,3,ROGBEN,23/01/2020,Very nice and quiet corner. Attention not suitable for motorhomes road car with large holes
103489,3250824,5,AmaiaG,02/09/2023,We only stopped to rest in the afternoon. with the cool boy with the swings. picnic areas and also some covered ones. good site. road noise the only thing
103489,2821826,4,ruedines,05/06/2023,"We spent Friday night very well, yes there were groups of young people but they didn't bother. There were marks on the floor of the parking lot from skidding but the truth was we were fine."
103489,2324991,3,anidoc,31/08/2022,"We have stopped to eat. The place is fine, tables in the shade and two water points, but it is very dirty, the area with the tables is full of garbage."
103489,1943503,4,Yolanda23,03/06/2022,"area to rest and have a very pleasant picnic We have not spent the night Please pick up the garbage :(, with all the garbage that was there and everything on the ground"
103489,1717113,3,saba11,27/12/2021,"The place is fine. We have not stayed overnight. We just went to get water. There is a fountain next to the park, but it cannot be accessed by van. To fill bottles well. The second source we have not seen. There is lighting."
103489,1423916,4,Petites_nomades,08/08/2021,"Good place to stop to rest. Quiet place near the highway. Very spacious parking. Shaded picnic tables and playground for the kids. Containers and fountain. We only stopped to eat, we did not spend the night."
103489,1261873,5,shirisillum,18/06/2021,"We liked a lot. It had drinking water, a wastewater disposal area, and recycling bins. Silence and flat place. Very very good for Alpicat!"
103489,968405,2,AnaJon,16/08/2020,"Very comfortable and pleasant area near the highway, it has two fountains and one of them works. It has a small park for children and a picnic area. Nearby there are cinemas. The only but is that we spent the night on a Saturday and there were groups of young people gathered but it was not an inconvenience to sleep."
103489,941571,1,Txelluki,09/08/2020,Don’t come to this place on weekends because it’s the meeting point for bottlenecks and skidding.
103489,842197,3,fufufurgoneta,30/06/2020,"Picnic area with 4 tables in the shade and 6 without. Playground with 2 slides and swings. It was very dirty, I guess they hadn’t cleaned it up after St. John."
103489,666577,4,lispanico,29/08/2019,"We have stopped alone to eat. Quiet place, we have parked under a shade of a tree. There are 2 sources, one does not work the other does."
103489,576878,4,TiphFred,26/07/2019,"Pleasant stopping point with picnic tables, games for children and no water. Some tables are sheltered. No toilet."
103496,2745635,5,the-globetrotter,13/05/2023,Very large level square with many trees. We had a very quiet night. Perfect for transit.
103496,2621669,5,parkhymervan,24/03/2023,"Very quiet, lots of space, perfect for those passing through. The ground is relatively flat. The gravel is deep and every vehicle leaves correspondingly deep tracks. But it is not an impairment."
103496,2523723,5,mariousai,18/12/2022,"the cemetery parking is always an excellent solution. you don't disturb them and they don't disturb you :-) anyway... great flat space, super quiet. I slept like a baby! absolutely recommended."
103496,2505642,4,cycleretreats73,26/11/2022,"Our first night in a camper. This was a perfect stop lots of space and very quiet, stunning sky over the mountains. Yes it’s a gravel park but it’s a lovely spot, no facilities really but lots of lovely places to walk and very quiet."
103496,2379598,5,park4nigt38140,17/09/2022,Parking in the shade ideal for a snack
103496,1902953,4,ArthurColson,20/05/2022,"Very quiet parking outside the city, very well shaded. Be careful, we did not find water at the cemetery"
103496,1852417,4,rvanvugt,25/04/2022,"A perfect spot for one or two nights, quiet during the night and very few people during the day. Some noise of the main road and depending on the wind, also from the highway. The Via Verde de la Sierra de Baza passes by and is a lovely 55km long way to walk or bike. Trashbins at cementery. Bumpy gravelled area, sometimes used by local youth as drifting area. Acces by small road, no problems."
103496,1769159,5,schnurriburli,28/02/2022,"Huge, empty, usable summer and winter, without any restrictions. We spent a wind-protected, quiet night. Space available for every vehicle size."
103496,1627619,5,ChrisSamsDad,05/10/2021,"Easy access on tarmac Rd, lots of shade, we only stopped for a siesta and coffee, but would be a great quiet overnight place."

This is a naturist beach. So don't be surprised when you arrive and go for a walk. You may not even see the people as they are in the dunes usually. A very odd person will strip off in the carpark to walk to the beach.

103557,1654310,4,buzzlevanAE,20/10/2021,"Awesome ! We spent two nights in the parking lot with no worries. The police came by, but didn't tell us anything. You can go on foot to visit the small town and the port. Only negative point, there are no toilets nearby. In addition, the streetlights stay on all night."
103557,1636214,5,HalloIchReise,10/10/2021,"Very nice spot with a park right next to it. Police came by, said nothing, just sent away a camper who was not allowed to park. Highly recommended and you are never alone"

Otherwise very nice setting to stop. Parking space therefore good if a small van or motorhome does not require several places."
103557,1518214,4,deividpm4,27/08/2021,"Hi! We have spent the night on this site. We were a little scared by the comments we had read, but there has been no problem. Our van is 2.85 high and attracts attention. So it is advisable to sleep here and get up with these views."

103557,1371238,3,Barritos,27/07/2021,"Free parking with very few free spaces, since it is used by mundaka residents due to its proximity to the town. Good views if you take a place overlooking the sea and the hermitage of Santa Catalina. It is lit by streetlights all night."

103557,1233433,4,Ruben4050,03/06/2021,"We had a quiet night. In the morning people walk or run. At night some teenage noise until 11 or so. It is quite clear, you park under the streetlights. Great views: the sea, Isla de Izaro and the Ermita de Santa Catalina. Next to the Hermitage there is a green area with a bank and a little more towards the port a fountain (about 5 minutes from the parking lot)"

103559,2508618,3,Timboo200,29/11/2022,"nice spot, very quiet and on a beautiful reservoir. However, access via the small village is almost impossible for larger vans, as the streets are very narrow and curvy. Motorhomes don't stand a chance here and shouldn't even try. The path over the dam is also narrow but rather manageable, but vehicles weighing more than 2 tons are not allowed to pass it."
103559,2179754,4,Disco5,05/08/2022,"We stopped in early August. The water level did not allow to go as in the photo. We stayed in the second parking lot. Lots of people passing by in the evening and in the morning (locals for sports or walking the dog). The water does not invite swimming, too muddy."

The people of the area know him and they come to bathe. The difficulty of getting here is not tremendous but it is not easy either. And only Renault traffic type vans, not bigger. The swamp has a lot of mud when entering the water"
103559,1450667,5,kostja493,13/08/2021,Very beautiful place. Access only for normal vehicles with 4x4 and good ground clearance.

At the bottom there is a small parking lot for about 6 vehicles. in the evenings and at night you are relatively alone as very few dare to descend. The way back via the village of Abdet is much more relaxed. I can only recommend it."
103559,1374901,1,Schwinni,28/07/2021,"We are on the road with a T4 and are experienced drivers. The access really costs nerves and time. Super narrow, steep streets with oncoming traffic (but there is only room for one car on the street). We finally gave up and drove on."

103559,890038,1,Rororous4,22/07/2020,Already with a medium camper it is difficult to go through the town ... I do not want to imagine with a caravan. We could never get there since the impossible slopes before the end of the road are coming up with an impossible climb ...

103559,403227,1,dailyvanlife,02/11/2018,We are traveling for four months now and this was probably the worst spot so far. We are traveling in a van but the streets were very very narrow. There is almost no water and parking next to a bin. Definitely not recommend this spot to anyone!
103559,391389,5,Findbecca,11/10/2018,"A really beautiful place to stay. Thank you very much for sharing. Quite steep, tight and windy roads getting there. Definitely only suitable for a small camper van. We were joined by one other small campervan aside this were secluded and undisturbed. The views are incredible, right next to the reservoir. The only amenities are a big bin."

It happened to us that there was a wedding on a farm next door and we had music until 6 in the morning… but to visit the cave of the cat it is very, very close."
103753,2930576,4,marcaini,06/07/2023,The parking lot in the photos in which the shadow appears is closed. You cannot park in that area and in the other two the sun shines all the time. The cat's cave is less than 5 minutes away across the bridge. The water is cold cold but a quick dip can be taken.
103753,2916696,4,Tobi21,02/07/2023,"Parking space on a major road, but there is hardly any traffic at night. The parking lot costs 1€, has some flat areas and above all the small oasis by the cave is recommended! Super nice water."
103753,2779825,5,HEonTour,23/05/2023,"Top! Overnight accommodation is no problem. Silly quiet. For larger campers, it is wise to park on the upper terrain. The steep road down takes you to a second parking lot, but only for cars and camper vans. Unfortunately, the nearby cave cannot be visited from the inside, but the water nearby is great for a refreshing dip."
103753,2740575,5,TraficJam,11/05/2023,"We had a great night. Entrance for the parking is €1. In the evening the police came but didn't say anything. We went to the lower parking lot but I'm not sure how the going up will go. Swimming in the Cueva was very refreshing, I can recommend it!"
103753,2721737,5,senipan,04/05/2023,"for us 5 ** we slept below, 2 em floor, I strongly advise against the path is well burst, we managed to go up with our old motorhome, but with difficulty beautiful cave places and magnificent swimming point too. Be careful at night the dogs from the neighboring houses came to steal a shoe from me, 45 'to find it'--"
103753,2649535,4,Beeasm3,08/04/2023,"The site is beautiful and very easy to access by road. There are fences to enter the parking lot that are lowered 24 hours a day. Very important that to pass you have to pay €1 in cash. The car park has two areas, the first up just past the fences and the second, which is accessed from the right, which is flatter and more private, although large motorhomes may not be able to go down the slope."
103753,2557607,1,izanmalaga,22/01/2023,"They have put up some fences to charge for parking and a motorhome does not fit, they have made it super narrow. not recommendable"
103753,2534722,4,Zephyrus91,30/12/2022,"beautiful view, and relatively quiet at night despite the road next door. the police came once in the evening and once in the morning for security we did not go to see the cave because the bridge is broken, but there are a few stones lined up for the more adventurous ☺️"
103753,2177390,5,isabel_juan,05/08/2022,"good place to go down to see the cave and to spend the night. Free camping is prohibited, but it says nothing about staying overnight. At night it is empty and some campers or motorhomes remain. I recommend parking upstairs, because there is another one downstairs, but the slope is sandy and steep, a car hardly goes up. While we were there, the guard came, turned around and left. There are containers."
103753,2004896,4,FranciscoCarrico,23/06/2022,"Amazing spot, the lake/waterfall is really beautiful. 

Tends to get crowded on the weekend.

I've stayed on the lower part of the parking lot with an old caravan over 6m - the road down/up can be a bit scary but doable.

One * less because of the very loud strong winds during the evening (no ideia if it's an ""all year""  thing or just bad luck when I was there)"
103753,1979320,4,GeraDS,15/06/2022,"The place is spectacular, at least during the week. They have fixed the access through the broken bridge with a small walkway that can be seen in the photos"
103753,1830176,4,thevivavan,17/04/2022,"Good parking, now the access to the Cueva del Gato is closed because the bridge has broken, but you can cross the river on foot, the water is up to your ankles and that way you can access the Cave and see it."
103753,1827704,4,TravelInspire,16/04/2022,Amazing place! The park is ok but it can be crowded on weekends. Spent the night there with no issues although not so many flat places. To visit the Cueva del Gato you have to cross the river because the bridge is broken but it's really easy and worth the visit. Recommended to park in the upper area.
103753,1789300,3,Gregouille67,20/03/2022,"We didn't sleep but the cueva del gato is not accessible today, the bridge is destroyed / broken"
103753,1747061,4,Tom.clb,03/02/2022,"Excellent for spending the night as well as the day. This car park could be perfect but indeed the waste is everywhere while garbage cans are at the entrance. We picked up the toilet paper and waste lying around, it filled a 30 liter garbage bag. Keep the place clean, the nature spots where we are allowed are rare."
103753,1710308,5,DyliO,15/12/2021,"I recommend this site because there is a magnificent view of the mountains, very calm, right next to a waterfall and the del gato cellar, small downside people throw everything and anything on the hill it's really too bad to pollute like that ..."
103753,1639233,2,Paolosbird,11/10/2021,We got here and it was filthy.  Discarded toilet paper everywhere and very windy.  We carried on to Jimera de Libar and found a nice spot

103753,1399930,5,Patruski,03/08/2021,"Good place both to park during the day and go to the cat's cave as to spend the night. There is a boy at the entrance but he DID NOT CHARGE US ANYTHING. To the right of the car park there is a very steep slope that leads to another kind of car park (I do not recommend going down, the ascent is complicated) further down there is another esplanade but there are signs forbidden to park."
103753,1343097,5,davidsunliving,20/07/2021,Very quiet place. When we arrived there was a guy with a tent who charged one euro for parking. The next day he was gone. nice views and next to the Cueva del Gato.

103753,1239351,5,GreletNina,06/06/2021,We had a very good night with a view of the very quiet cave to sleep in. The bridge to access is broken but there are rocks installed to cross the river!
103753,1224815,5,Mariejahnne31,29/05/2021,"Perfect, I spent two nights at the top, I was parked in the parking lot next to the river, I can tell you it's the best"
103753,1091627,3,malu26,12/10/2020,"If you park at the bottom. The hotel owners complain to the Civil Guard. They were only supposed to identify us and not fined ... but we'll see. They asked all those who had stayed overnight because they could not spend the night 20 meters from the river bank, they told us. However it is parking area during the day. We are like criminals again."
103753,406908,4,FrenchKangoo,12/11/2018,The wooden bridge visible in photo 2 has been washed away by the flood so the cave is only accessible to experienced speleologists (river to cross).
103753,406907,4,FrenchKangoo,12/11/2018,"Stayed for 2 nights no worries. There are actually three floors of parking: one at the road level, a visible location taking the first right that goes down when you leave the road. Then a last one which is ""the real car park"" which goes on the left on a dirt road taking the direction of the second carpark. Beware the floods have ravaged the area. Avoid steep slopes because mud is everywhere on the roads."

103766,2397034,4,miriamsainza,23/09/2022,"quiet and flat site in the middle of nature, incredible views as there are several viewpoints in the area (sorry for the antennas). During the night a car approaches while we were the only one to rally at the paved roundabout, we could see marks on the ground but none of them matched us. We parked looking at the pine forest to protect ourselves from the sunrise first thing in the morning. recommendable"
103766,2384321,2,pat4life,18/09/2022,"We arrived at night to sleep, very nice place with a beautiful view of Bragança. However, a lot of comings and goings of several cars during the night (music, appointments, etc.) did not feel safe we preferred to leave"
103766,2382463,5,kiwimarjo,18/09/2022,Extraordinary view of the city of Bragança. Small terrace to rest and enjoy the view. Possibility to sleep. On the other hand a lot of cigarette butts and broken glasses. It's a shame not to respect the places....
103766,1865916,4,Obinch,02/05/2022,"Very good location to sleep when you want to visit Braganca. Belvedere a stone's throw away with a breathtaking view of the city. Lots of room, flat ground. The small downside is the proximity of many antennas, the advantage is that we pick up very well! A little dirty, please bury your droppings and PQ, take your garbage away..."
103766,1407095,4,Mathosder,05/08/2021,Very convenient after visiting Bragança. 7 minutes from the center. the view of the city at night is superb.

103771,1895922,5,eldelacajita,17/05/2022,"Fantastic place to get to know the Castañar de El Tiemblo and enjoy the song of the birds. We spent the night alone with another van. Three terraced car parks with level ground of compacted earth. Picnic area, garbage containers. The Civil Guard came by to look, they didn't say anything. There are fountains, we don't know if they are drinkable. Not for very large ACs. It is reached by a wide and quite good dirt track."
103771,739252,5,Tomasvm,06/11/2019,"From 18:00 they do not charge to park. Quiet, safe, level and in full nature. Access track in good condition even in the rainy season. The Castañar is amazing."
103777,1165078,4,DariushSeBalade,03/04/2021,Beautiful but there is no internet. Maybe a little too close to the road? I have the impression that the police are more present in this region than in Andalusia ...

103779,1141311,3,Aiborra,23/02/2021,Good place to stop during the day but I do not recommend it for the night We read in several comments on Google that it was a very common area for robberies and a neighbor confirmed it. It is also a cruising area so many cars pass by looking and it is not quiet
103779,1140651,4,JonathanBMX,22/02/2021,Stayed here for one night with out disturbance. It surely is a nice option for an overnight-stay.

103779,960470,4,titoJuli,14/08/2020,The site is great. With the size of the Covid19 restaurants have been closed but the good thing is that the police are more visible but before the robberies were frequent. There are showers every few meters and the beach is great.

Black, you must lift the small round lid of each plot, there is the drain and for that you need screwdrivers, test passed, but... and water to clean the poti? To recharge the water, the tapa is the square one next to the black one, one per plot, it is at the bottom and the first of the taps is covered with earth. In the second, if we find the outlet, without a handle, use a wrench to open the water and since we put the car close, the water that fell was filling the hole. To close it, make a hole with water, see how you hit the wrench, and then clean the poti. We do fill up but I only recommend it for emergencies or if you get bored and want a new experience."

103794,1864051,5,varkaleta,01/05/2022,"It is a perfect place to spend a peaceful night. With tables, fountain and very good views. Google Maps sends you on a shorter path that can't be climbed, choose the path that passes through the village."

Nobody passed or bordered us. Access not that easy, but follow signs “L’Ermita”. When you turn left from the towns main street it is indeed quite steep, but you don’t need 4x4. Any truck or buscamper can make it, but larger motorhomes will have trouble with this short steep road. Try it, worth the effort."

the town you have to go through is not made for big motorhomes. We were in a VW T25 which was fine. But I wouldn't recommend going if you are a big motorhome"

We had our doubts since at the entrance there is a sign that seems to say that you cannot stay overnight ... do not take it into account; We ask the townspeople and they can sleep without a problem.

Nearby water path."
