17363,110566,3,ratatouille37,19/10/2016,"Excellent parking for visiting the old town, but clearly forbidden at night to motorhomes, the police do rounds. Moreover access is difficult for large motorhomes, narrow streets and cars parked anyhow!"
17363,86042,3,Ravanastron,27/07/2016,Carefree night and quiet enough on the van parking.
17363,76668,3,Luc,12/06/2016,"Nice place near the Roman bridge, a small place behind the chapel can be spent the night quiet, I have not tested, in any case beautiful place."
17364,3264824,4,the_wal,06/09/2023,"Parked here only during the day to visit Aveiro. The place is ideal for that. We couldn't find any toilets, but there are plenty of public ones in the city"
17364,3240459,4,Elodizinha,31/08/2023,Free parking in the city center. Practical for leaving the campervan while you visit the city of Aveiro on foot.
17364,3186837,1,Pumba87,20/08/2023,"Of many places seen and used, this is the worst of them all!!! Scruffy, dirty, grimy, full of rubbish (and not even a bin), under an overpass with the smell of pee everywhere. We stopped for one night (only because we had no alternative) trying to put ourselves in the most decent place possible! The only positive note: the proximity to the city center"
17364,3173563,4,moa65,18/08/2023,"The park is very central, perfect for visiting the town. Despite being located under the freeway, we slept well. It's a pity that many small cars park in the motorhome area. Thank you to the people of Aveiro."
17364,3140147,3,oriolrue,13/08/2023,we were visiting the town and parked here for a couple of hours good shady place under the highway bridge at night I don't know
17364,3121911,3,Michoco1214,11/08/2023,"Full to the top, and mostly by small vehicles.. a pity that the exclusivity for AC and caravans is not respected.. otherwise, it is a very good place to park"
17364,3121827,4,sophie.l,11/08/2023,day parking indicated for motorhomes. very close to the canals for boat trips and the city in less than 10 minutes on foot. Paying toilets in the parking lot next door. very beautiful city. no service. flat. full sun. (we were not allowed to park in the shade of the bridge)
17364,3117412,4,L_Fabia,10/08/2023,"Great for visiting Aveiro, we found a seat at around 6:00 p.m. without any problems. But I wouldn't want to sleep here (ugly and noisy)"
17364,3111920,4,parkfornighttarbes65,10/08/2023,Perfect location to visit Aveiro 10 minutes from the center. Free we did not spend the night there but it seems to be possible.
17364,3081906,5,BrackeHedwig,05/08/2023,If you can't find a seat just wait. Cars leave regularly. Many places possible for parking a long mobile home. 7.5 meters no problem. Of course you have to be a bit lucky.
17364,3075924,3,stephane_cordar,04/08/2023,"Good for visiting. But no space in the designated parking lot, you have to go a little further because the cars also park. Right next to the canals and the entrance to the city"
17364,3044039,3,Mimouche,30/07/2023,"Great area well located for visiting Aveiro. However, the Tourist Office advised us not to stay there overnight for security reasons. Fortunately, because it allowed us to sleep in a great spot in Costa Nova near the beach!"
17364,3035492,1,MarcAg15,28/07/2023,"In principle it is an area for AC and there was everything except that. The place did not seem very safe either, we have parked near here without problem."
17364,3035397,4,Danielnomad,28/07/2023,5 min to old town. Free. Flat. Big parking but very very ugly place under big bridge.
17364,3011764,3,lauryz,24/07/2023,"Well located to park during the day and visit the town, but not to stay overnight (it gives a feeling of insecurity). To stay overnight, the one next to the bus terminal is better."
17364,3004715,3,Ayaris56,23/07/2023,Very good for parking 2 steps from the city center nickel. There are restrooms nearby along the canal (0.50 cents). Well signposted
17364,2976032,4,JavieloArroyo,17/07/2023,"Good place to sleep next to more Motorhomes, there are no services. Aveiro center very close."
17364,2969577,3,davsar69,15/07/2023,"Very convenient to easily visit Aveiro on foot. Possible to park a large camper>7m. Fulfills its role fully and for free. As they say: ""It's ugly, but it's practical!"" ;-)"
17364,2968260,1,Rubao_europa,15/07/2023,"Just a park to be able to go for a walk in the city, because other than that it's not good. There is no bathroom, it smells like urine, it is full of cars and it does not feel safe to stay overnight."
17364,2954889,2,febronio,12/07/2023,"Nothing extraordinary, really not the best but a tourist town and nothing free, we are happy with what we find."
17364,2953234,3,camafogr,12/07/2023,Well located and quiet.
17364,2941609,1,rakelllllll,09/07/2023,"It doesn't look good, we left because of the bad looks... abandoned caravans, highway up... WE DON'T TRUST"
17364,2938852,5,kike1815,08/07/2023,Parking with easy access for all types of ac and very comfortable for sightseeing. We did not stay to sleep but it does not seem highly recommended. More than anything because it is right under a highway
17364,2864470,3,Travelcrazynl,17/06/2023,"fine place near the centre. felt save. aveiro is an okay little tourist hub. the parking is flat and the noise from the road is okay. even shade possible from the highway, for those hot summer days. no services, expect a public toilet"
17364,2791094,3,Nikoulen,27/05/2023,Good for the day. Center 500 meters. ideally located but not for sleeping because of the highway which passes above you. very nice city.

17364,2673317,4,Anfrie,15/04/2023,"Great place to visit the city. Easily accessible from the motorway, free of charge and just under 10 minutes' walk from the old town."
17364,2646902,1,Tonir34,07/04/2023,"hello, bad experience, it is impossible to sleep, there is noise everywhere and you don't feel calm either with the fixed caravans that live there, I do not recommend"
17364,2630123,3,stefaneija,29/03/2023,"Note:  the  entrance  to  this  parking  is blocked completely caused of constuction works, for long time."
17364,2596467,2,MerelFlorence,02/03/2023,"We wanted to park here to visit the town. The place is especially for vans, but it didn’t feel very safe. We didn’t really trust the environment. Decided to leave again."
17364,2586112,3,CloharsC,21/02/2023,Great for visiting the city or starting a cycle tour along the canals then in the marshes. Highway and train noise. There is room for camping because all day at this time.
17364,2522815,3,Ivkofamily,16/12/2022,Effective for visiting the city. Noisy to sleep there.
17364,2491944,1,Sevenik,12/11/2022,"At the moment only Portuguese (stationary) campers and some nomads, I didn't feel safe leaving the camper here"
17364,2446574,3,Rolo1,16/10/2022,"It looks grim at first glance, but we had a good 2 nights here. You can hear the road but we slept well We did not find the water point. Short walking distance to the center. Salt pans also nearby. Emptying is free at the station. Standing there is difficult is often full."
17364,2428654,3,CamperliJuDo,07/10/2022,"Parking well placed for a visit to the city. Very noisy...the city is nothing romantic, construction everywhere, the gondolas work with an engine. Good by far but far from good. Long live Venice of Italy!"
17364,2414640,3,Joss44,30/09/2022,A little creepy at first glance but perfect for visiting the city. We have not slept there because the highway passes above.
17364,2378400,1,ablanc19,16/09/2022,"We went to park today to visit the salt flats and check out the site for the night and finally decided to go somewhere else. In addition, the highway passes over it and there is a continuous noise that is quite annoying. I do not recommend it."
17364,2369972,3,kevpot4night,14/09/2022,"Parking very close to the city center. Just passing through, we did not sleep there. Many places in the car park but it is very quickly filled due to its popularity and proximity to the city center (6min walk) some had taken out their table to eat on site, I find the place under the highway a little too noisy for that, but it's still doable"
17364,2366197,3,khris1166,12/09/2022,"parking in full sun, to stay for a while it works, it is not guarded, but it is close to the town, you can walk ... it has no service."
17364,2361652,4,100drine_T,11/09/2022,"perfect parking to visit the city of Aveiro. There is a fountain at the end of the car park, but it is not possible to fill its reservoir. Be careful, there is someone who comes to watch the parking lot and who asks questions if you stay too long."
17364,2323402,4,u1277,31/08/2022,Perfect for a stroll through town. We slept a little further near the beach.
17364,2282399,5,xavifv,22/08/2022,Peaceful place. Today I am spending the night and without problem. A lot of movement of motorhomes but we did not stay more than 10.
17364,2243374,2,charrok,15/08/2022,"I had previously slept there, before the virus, now it's not like before, since I currently don't like it at all, half-drugged beggars approach us at night and insistently ask us for money when we return from dinner around 11:30 p.m., there are fixed with bad appearance. The municipal chamber could close the enclosure, charge a small amount and it would be a 5* site for its location."
17364,2227825,2,MorenoFiorelli,13/08/2022,large parking lot near the center and the salt pans. there are Roma caravans that make noise until late with boys playing and shouting without a minimum of respect for the many crews present. you can't sleep!
17364,2222156,4,Vicente35,12/08/2022,Ideal parking to visit Aveiro on foot during the day. Only 10-15 min walk from the center. We went there with a stroller with no problem!
17364,2217573,1,onthegowithflow,11/08/2022,We rested for a while with the intention of eventually going into the city but it didn't feel good and safe enough to leave our camper here alone. Strange people hang out in and around the place. So we ran off again.
17364,2205509,2,autofamily2018,09/08/2022,"Very noisy place, only valid, to buy salt, in the nearby salt mine, and to visit by gondola (€12), you have to book."
17364,2191847,4,Family4Road,07/08/2022,"We have not stayed overnight. Suitable for parking during the day and visiting the city. From what I have read and seen, it is not entirely appropriate to spend the night in it."
17364,2154210,1,PelicansVoladors,01/08/2022,"Not recommended place since there are a number of people who are installed in vans and caravans which at one point came out screaming and running after each other, we left immediately."

17364,2142609,4,RutaCadiz,29/07/2022,"It's close to the center, there are people permanently installed there, they look bad, but they didn't give us any problems, we slept well, the police came by twice, I liked the place."
17364,2141927,1,Javisag,29/07/2022,"To visit Aveiro well, because it is close to the center. At night it's scary... the night we stayed we couldn't sleep until 4 o'clock. People from the caravans were hanging around with iron bars, screaming, hitting things... insecure. Not recommended at all if you appreciate your ac. Also motorcycle races on the upper highway until the wee hours."
17364,2118895,5,cleachpn,24/07/2022,"Very good parking, there are a lot of CC. Access by the small bridge can be complicated for very large vehicles but otherwise it is very good, five minutes from the city."
17364,2105461,3,elvi,22/07/2022,"great car park to visit the canals, it is a motorhome park but cars park here too, under the bridge there were old motorhomes with broken windows and children running, but on the opposite side there was a whole row of motorhomes where you can leave it quietly because always is there someone."
17364,2093913,1,Ch31u,19/07/2022,"It did not give us much confidence, at first we parked here, but we were not calm, there were children running between the cars and fighting with tools to till the field and we decided to take the van to the avenue that is next door, there without problem. We parked and went to see Aveiro."
17364,2072155,4,LaPepona,14/07/2022,"Great parking, at night places are always more crowded during the day. There is a shaded area under the bridge, and everything is level. There are a couple of fixed caravans with tables outside, it seems that the police don't bother. next to the center"
17364,2021287,4,paufp,29/06/2022,"We stayed 2 days and 2 nights very well. We went to the area 2 times and it was always packed. It is true that there are some installed caravans that give an appearance of insecurity but I did not see any suspicious behavior. at night you can hear the noise from the highway but it didn't wake us up. it is very close to the old area, with a small playground opposite, perfect for children to play."
17364,2018044,4,DUCATOVAN,28/06/2022,Very close to the city center and in summer with many cars and campers We have slept very well and it has not seemed dangerous as indicated in a comment but it is true that being so close to the road there is some noise but not very annoying
17364,2016328,3,Cesip,27/06/2022,to see Aveiro in luxury. Very noisy. under the bridge at night I don't know if it will be comfortable to sleep. the caravans of people who live there fan a bit of a bad feeling the truth

17364,1992762,3,ManuelaFigueiredo,19/06/2022,Great place to park and visit the city on foot or in the moliceiros.
17364,1855178,3,korrigan76,27/04/2022,"Location a stone's throw from the historic center with toilets and garbage cans, but noisy (under the highway), overcrowded with cars parking there and unwelcoming (a few caravans and vans of people who live there year-round). But with a negative a priori, I stayed several nights (putting myself on the side of the tourist CCs) and no worries. Location not pleasant, but quiet and close to the center"
17364,1830001,3,saragranda,17/04/2022,"Close to the center, ample parking and despite passing the road above, we slept well."
17364,1815771,1,FerdiVan21,11/04/2022,"We only parked there during the day to visit the city. Because we are traveling with a dog, we parked under the bridge (shadow). When we got back to the camper, two boys between the ages of 12-14 walked past the cars and kept looking into the cars. Apparently they live in the run-down trailers under the bridge. We had a bad feeling!"
17364,1814384,1,jpcath,10/04/2022,"parking very ugly and uncomfortable with noise. no benefit. approach the motorhome area provided for this purpose next to the ""Continente"" store where you have the services. 2 car parks available about 2 km from the city center"
17364,1780697,1,Homer17420,12/03/2022,Location certainly not far from the center of interest. But infamous. We did not stay there.
17364,1734138,1,IvanMoreno94,15/01/2022,"It was seeing it and leaving immediately, it gives you the feeling that they are going to rob you of what you have inside, we prefer to sleep in the parking lot of the station or Comparison point, this parking lot was empty, there were only caravans parked, destroyed with broken glass... and in the everything else very different."
17364,1715699,4,HanneJamina,25/12/2021,"Parking u derneath the bridge! Not the long strech next to the water. When arriving in the dark, you might miss it. Walking distance to the nice center"

17364,1680663,4,DiegoZapatero,07/11/2021,When I got to park there were several people there who did not give much confidence but since there were several motorhomes I left it there. When I returned there was no one there and it was quiet even though I had not stayed there.

17364,1609839,1,Papyducati,26/09/2021,Parking just for walking around town. Very practical I think you should avoid leaving your things lying around because people are prowling around the motorhomes. It is not glamorous.
17364,1601286,4,veronica1980,23/09/2021,"Very good location to visit the old area of Aveiro, we are two girls and we feel safe, if it is somewhat dirty, but it is great for a day"

17364,1012700,1,Misterlois,29/08/2020,More cars than motorhomes. It puts a clear sign of only motorhomes and they do not respect it. We have arrived and asked a car to please let us park and they told us that they were not moving. Then there is a gorilla who asks you € 5 to leave it there ... we do not recommend it. Finally we have not found a place for our nasturtium of 7.40 and we have had to go !!!! Very angry with the site that is reserved for our vehicles and it is not respected .....

17364,901527,4,Jesus188,26/07/2020,"Five minutes from this beautiful city. Although we did not have problems of site, the cars occupy places of AC. We did not spend the night, but the noise can be remarkable being very close to the highway. Recommendable."

The only evil is that it seems to me that they pour water near the fence for the 2 days I had here it was always full of water near the fence."
17364,783795,2,Anniedidier,21/02/2020,"Free parking, very good for visiting the city, but a bit noisy for the night, we spent a night with 30 other motorhomes. Little Venice of Portugal. To do, the boat trip (moliceiros) on the central canal, departure at 200 m."
17364,783166,4,panzaritas,19/02/2020,"Perfect for visiting Aveiro, two minutes walk from the Jardim do Rossio that is already the center, apparently safe because Aveiro is one of the safest cities in Portugal, we went in February and there would be about 10 Motorhomes and three or four caravans that live permanently there but do not bother. The only fault that you hear a lot of highway traffic but for the location it is also worth it is legal"

17364,759569,4,ferreiratrip,29/12/2019,"An excellent place to stop and visit the beautiful city of Aveiro. Seats are always few as it is shared with cars.

At the reception we kindly suggest the schedule and the city map with a cross where you are and the bus stop in town. A pipe: go down Puerta de Zamora and for the return sidewalk opposite Bus 34 or 23, ask the driver Villamayor Camping Ruta de la Plata and it will do it. Parking is very quiet despite the highway and all amenities (shower, dishes and toilets are old but very clean). Ability to empty black water between showers in a well equipped stone hut. Emptying gray water at the bottom of the car park, untreated water available. Novice of the camper, I have of course found charitable souls (59) for some kind advice on the road to Portugal."

17450,2600084,4,FranEP,05/03/2023,"What to say. It is a parking lot with somewhat narrow access. You have to maneuver well, especially large motorhomes. It has the great advantage of being very close to the historic center on foot to get to know the city. It transmits security because there is always movement and I have seen the National Police go by. It is true that during the day there is a lot of movement of cars and at night much less, even so something is heard. In my case it did not prevent me from resting. Right next to it there is a park to walk on the banks of the very beautiful Jerte river. I recommend this car park to visit Plasencia and spend the night. I adjusted my entry and exit times knowing the hours with the least volume of cars parked inside to disturb as little as possible and to maneuver better. I recommend it."

17450,1062554,4,pedixi,21/09/2020,Very central for the escalator to the town nice walks by the river and water available by the restaurant but need to carry to car park. Supermarket and shops very near
17450,1053392,3,Ismana,17/09/2020,Near the center. Much noise at night.
17450,1048113,3,AdolfoGabriel,14/09/2020,"It is very central and close to the river to spend the day, but it does not have any service"
17450,793250,5,JORDI2EURA,09/03/2020,"Very good parking, next to elevators and escalators that comfortably take you to the front door of the city, and close to a super day."
17450,785835,2,luismi-izq,24/02/2020,"Access a bit complicated for a large vehicle, and a lot of cars during the week. Better the other parking, although you have to walk 5 more minutes to go downtown"
17450,768556,4,katy47,14/01/2020,"The parking lot we went to was not downstairs but along the road opposite the bus station, moderately quiet but well located for visiting the magnificent cathedral, worth a visit, no service"
17450,716474,3,2205,08/10/2019,"No service on this car park. By cons the place is quiet with a nice view, depending on the location, on the park. About 15 minutes walk from the old town. For lovers of old stones do not miss the visit of the cathedral (4 € very widely justified). And of course lose yourself in the alleys of old Plasencia."
17450,708588,3,VicMc,29/09/2019,"We spent the night without problems, later there is another parking lot where we could see more motorhomes. By day it is full, at night there is more than enough room. It has not a shadow."
17450,689279,2,titoJuli,13/09/2019,It is closed for works Sep / 13/2019
17450,645524,4,shocki1988,20/08/2019,Recommendable. Next to a rain pool with many green areas. There is usually no noise. The entrance is a bit narrow for a caravan. During the day the parking lot is usually filled. Very close to the center to visit the historic area of the city. Supermarket next door.
17450,601453,4,celuwind,05/08/2019,"I stayed one night and whole day, perfect to visit the city, very large parking, good area next to the river where you can take a refreshing bath and then in the showers a good rinse, services and changing rooms very close, recommended!"
17450,598866,4,Pertxo,04/08/2019,"Urban parking without any service but very comfortable to spend the night. Be careful at the entrance, a little narrow, although it goes well. Quite empty at night when you arrive, but in the morning it is full so be careful if the AC is large due to the exit maneuvers"
17450,591554,4,jlb4087,01/08/2019,"No location for motorhomes, parking with place to choose. Just in front of the canal, the park and the trees, we forget the large car park behind."
17450,511847,5,MDWinsborrow,11/06/2019,"I only stayed for the day. However easy access and plenty of parking. The park adjacent is fantastic and caters for all kinds of sports. Head SW through the park to the restaurant and cross the waterway. A lift takes you up to the road and an external escalator climbs up to the old city. Amazing  facilities. I suspect when the town reaches 50° in the summer, everybody decends to this cool park."
17450,409262,1,Cracklos,21/11/2018,Too much racking of cars and trees infected with parrots. We last there 1h. Not recommended.
17450,407711,5,RitaRegalo,15/11/2018,"Parking great for overnight stay. You do not have any service. Although very busy you can rest. Access to the city is easy. We love the ""Parque de la Isla"" right next to the parking lot. It's beautiful in the fall and there's plenty of room for the dogs to walk around and play! Very good!"
17450,364087,3,Liko,03/09/2018,Park in common parking. The night was quiet. we arrived with temperature of 50 degrees stopping and going inside water!
17450,361364,3,gon943,01/09/2018,"We spent a quiet night in this parking lot, nearby to take a bath, shallow, the showers are near the kiosk (behind) next to the restaurant the Island which by the way is very expensive, there is a chiringuito about 5 minutes walk to the other parquing with more affordable prices, today we ate in this, better in the center, climbing escalators."
17450,354651,4,Brujillayfamilia,26/08/2018,"A good car park. Spacious and well taken care of. It does not have water discharge or loading services, although it is possible to stay overnight without problems. Very close to the natural pools with swimming area and the center of the city. The pools have outdoor cold water showers and changing rooms. Restaurant close to the bathroom area. Improvable canine area. Scarce shadow for AC."
17450,344332,4,Freesoul,20/08/2018,"Huge free parking in front of a park with the river Jerte, in which if it's hot you can bathe. Also grove with lawn and terraces to take something. We have stayed overnight and everything is very good. Although there are cars we have not noticed the noise. 10 min walk from the center."

17450,288774,4,martinul,14/07/2018,Very quiet to sleep. Ideal to visit the city because climbing a long escalators are in the historic center.
17450,271232,2,Calimero125,19/06/2018,"Large parking near the city center under video surveillance. Difficult access to large vehicles, we returned anyway with a convoy of 11.20 m. Quiet from 11am until 7am in the morning, after a lot of cars and it feels a little embarrassing. Beautiful park and swimming place to take the cool. We had a great night."
17450,223780,1,bato50,20/02/2018,"Difficult access for large vehicles, noisy until 1am, no convenience, not pleasant setting on a parking lot. Not worth the detour"
17450,207150,4,Josele2,29/10/2017,"We have slept here the two nights of this weekend and quiet like so many others we have spent here. Friday only us and Saturday with a camper.En the other parquin had three ac but that is noisy because of the traffic and has more inclinacion.Este It is very silent, we have slept here many weekends and we have never had any mishap.Vigilado with security cameras I recommend it"
17450,201055,2,RJ,07/10/2017,"Good for one night, but on a large parking lot. We were alone tonight, so we did not stay there."

17450,185322,4,clo6441,26/08/2017,Alright.
17450,172654,3,goizane,12/08/2017,"Perfect to know the town and take a dip in the natural pool next door. I do not recommend it to sleep, at least in summer, because it is a noisy area, people gathered, talking ..."
17450,147964,4,jaimemsb,04/07/2017,"Perfect site, with natural pool, showers, services, restaurants and nearby to visit Plasencia. The only drawback is that the seats are small, but if you go with a large vehicle you can go to the other parking lot that is 300m away."
17450,125259,2,willvy,04/04/2017,"It's all full of cars because it's part of a commercial area. There are no places for long vehicles, such as a caravan, and you have to take two contiguous free, a problem. So I opted to leave the one that appears farther north."
17450,115736,4,Julijimb,09/12/2016,"Great to know Plasencia, quiet. If you go with a dog right next to it, there is a park where you can let them go, there are also some natural pools."

17450,90309,4,bimesa,06/08/2016,Good place to visit the center with an elevator and escalators that take you there. Free river pool and very careful park.
17450,87385,4,charrok,31/07/2016,100% recommended site. Close to the center of the city and shops and bars. The best the river park right there. The only thing is that it is somewhat lonely during the winter months.
17450,78753,4,haytor,27/06/2016,"The perfect place for a warm stop in summer for the natural pools, very good the location to visit the old town, with an elevator that goes up so that it is a small walk. by day is a parking area that is usually filled."
17452,2598143,1,Perseo56,04/03/2023,I am from Alicante and I also live near this site. I don't know who would think of saying that this is a good place to spend the night. It's not at all safe and anyone who hasn't had anything happen to them has been very lucky. many homeless live around this place and steal everything they can. nothing recommended.
17452,2581225,4,A_Raf,17/02/2023,"Slept here one night on my vwt4, and then left it for the day, no issues, calm at night, gets crowded during the day."

17452,2306888,4,familiasobreruedas,26/08/2022,"We spent one night, I was doubtful because of the comments about robbery attempts, but we had no problems, I did not see the police go by, until 11 at night there were many people walking, but then the area was very lonely and dark. A couple of times cars passed by with loud music and they stayed there for a while Alado beach with a spider swing for the little ones"
17452,1985050,1,Saracabrera,17/06/2022,"In principle everything was ok, we stayed 2 nights, but the second night at 6 am, a guy forced the front door of the van and tried to rob us, thanks we caught him in the act and he escaped. We suspect it was the same guy who spent the day before begging us for food. And that the police frequently pass through the area. I do not recommend Alicante to caravanists, it is very insecure."
17452,1733494,4,lealdcke,13/01/2022,"Well placed to visit Alicante or go for a walk along the beach even if the road is close. Please note, no services at this time (January): the beach toilets are closed."
17452,1715492,5,Boxireist,25/12/2021,"Great spot, we stood all day. Certainly could have stayed the night, you only heard the road a bit and the trains that drive directly behind it. But you can walk nicely along the promende to the center (approx. 20 minutes)"
17452,1708014,5,O.A,11/12/2021,"Didn't stay but parked here to visit Alicante, ideal location"
17452,1687765,4,simonmultivant5,13/11/2021,"We stayed for one night at this parking spot. There were 5 more vans which stayed over night. There was no problem with police, other passers-by or thieves. The toilet next to the spot was closed, but about 300m to the right we found an opened public toilet. It wasn‘t noisy there too, we had a quiet and good night. (4 stars because of the area around - not that pretty)"
17452,1324956,1,sansonconan,14/07/2021,"Bad night parking, it smells a lot of piss and it's full of mosquitoes, we had to leave around 04:00 in the morning because we couldn't bear to be there."
17452,1170930,4,WonderfullyWildAdventure,09/04/2021,Great for visiting the city. Not many spaces so lucky if you get one. And water nearby is not drinkable
17452,1078263,3,adventuresapiens,02/10/2020,We park during the day. It seemed more or less safe.
17452,1065900,5,lostsunwhere,23/09/2020,"Very good parking, close to the center and facing the beach, we are 3.5 m high so looked like we can’t enter but if you go along the road (toward north) around 1km further is another entrance with no hight restriction. Few campers on side. We were told it’s free to stay but every 5 days you have to move at least 2 meters so they see that the car is not dropped. One elderly couple living here almost 10 years in a camper ? police pass by very often but never bothered. We make food outside and the drinking water fountain is 300m away. Grocery store and tapas bars just 3 minutes away. Palm trees everywhere, outdoor gym just few steps away. Basically paradise ? although be careful and don’t leave the windows open or the car unattended, there are some thief’s around and they don’t hesitate to enter the camper and steel the phone. Look after yourself xx always"
17452,921889,1,alexia1990,02/08/2020,"Preferably not overnight here. This morning they tried to get into our van. To another motorhome parked next door, if they have managed to enter and have been robbed. During the day it is quite safe, as the police frequently pass by along the beach promenade. But not at night."
17452,761644,4,Mo40,01/01/2020,"Friendly place, with a beautiful view. We were not disturbed by noise, good distance from the center. By cons no service in winter"
17452,721104,1,fizzghigg,14/10/2019,"The parking did not inspire confidence, and it smelled very strong. Noisy, in the city. We preferred to look further."
17452,563537,2,steffi_travel,19/07/2019,"Two people were standing in the parking lot, trying to get people into the parking lot. This was very suspicious to us, since they had no identifiers such as West etc. Because of that, turned around and left the place immediately. We can not say if something really happened, but we did not feel good!"
17452,537301,4,Frangel,03/07/2019,"Next to the sea, site with rocks for swimming or fishing, near restaurants and the beach promenade. On the beach there is water, where you wash feet."
17452,481448,5,Motorcraft21,11/05/2019,"Don’t be scared of 2.6m sign. I passed once again with 2.8m without problem. Also it could be done through the exit passage which is about 3,5m in height, if you are not afraid of police spoting you. Just keep in mind that the area is very busy until about 7PM, turn up after that and there will be plenty of free space."
17452,455963,1,perichs,15/04/2019,Restriction in height to 2.60. We with autoracavana could not enter by height.

17452,408234,5,Motorcraft21,17/11/2018,"A spot on parking, very close to the city center and Santa Barbara castle. Right at the end of the beach promenade. Area very clean and well kept. Despite of the nearby road and tram it is quiet too, day or night. It could get quite busy on weekdays during mornings and daytime, when many locals park their cars there and go to work. Much more space available starting from late afternoon and on Saturday it was rather empty. Stayed for 2 nights, really enjoed it."
17452,395637,4,MaeKris,19/10/2018,"Perfect for us. Not so far from the center, we spent the evening in the lively district of Santa Cruz at 15 minutes maximum. Beach toilets closed in this season day and night, we have been in the bar next to the train station. Maybe there are toilets available at the station elsewhere, to confirm."
17452,223535,5,AnjaIndie1,19/02/2018,"Great spot to park in the city. directly at the beach with playgrounds and water tubs, but no drinking water. 
it is very central, just a 20 minutes walk up to the Castillo Santa Barbara.
be careful with higher cars. the access to the parking place is limited for 2,60 due to a bridge you have to drive through. actually we did it with a car of 2,70, but it was close."
17452,221019,4,janicet,01/02/2018,Loved this simple parking spot by the beach. We actually stayed for 4 nights because we enjoyed Alicante town and the peaceful spot. Shame this coastline has so much debris washed up.
17452,220070,5,Idora,24/01/2018,Top for the night and the visit of the city.
17452,201416,5,masoru,09/10/2017,"Little height and little space but to sleep in a great van. It is difficult to access because the exit you find it suddenly and, if you pass, you have to go around to return. the chiringuito of the beach has a toilet that luckily we caught open at night. The place is quiet and pleasant, first line of the beach. Yes, mosquitoes."
17452,158185,5,freerider90,25/07/2017,"Super, we are entitled to round the police about every hour, water fountain to 100 m see map. We met a Frenchman who has been there for a month without any problem"

17456,2862644,5,zucche,17/06/2023,"Perfect parking. With shade, nature, park, picnic tables, park for dogs and children. It has a very good bar to drink and eat something. I stayed two nights alone, in the afternoon I went to visit Ávila 2km away and the police pass by, I slept peacefully. There is no height limit, but beware that it has low branches, just find the right spot. 5G Vodafone to work perfect."
17456,2855242,4,taborski,14/06/2023,"great, I have a cabover a little complicated to park with the low trees but I found a place. soon expansion of the parking lot without the trees and for the big ones it will be easier"

The SW bottom is recommended, next to the bicycle parking. Our big volume is 5.99m long and 2.66m high... we were very careful with the low branches.

17456,718304,4,Cheba,11/10/2019,"The parking lot next to the walls was occupied by the fairs, so we came to sleep here. Quiet though a bit secluded and lonely. As a resource for a perfect night"

It is also possible, from this point, to go up the river and can reach Alquezar in 45 min! You can also go to the village of Alquezar by road in 10 min, one of the most beautiful villages in Spain! It is also the start of a magnificent hike to discover the Footbridges of Alquezar! It is therefore an almost indispensable point of the region !!"

17530,345343,5,Chris33160,20/08/2018,Very nice campsite at the edge of Rio Vero ... 21 € for 2 with electricity. You have to find pitches to the entrance because there are very few toilets and showers for such a big campsite. the staff is very friendly.

17530,71741,4,managon,07/05/2016,Quiet campsite with access to the river vero. Near Alquezar but not in the same town. The bathrooms are old and there is no toilet paper but it is very clean and maintained. There are barbecue and picnic tables. Bar and shop. The staff is very attentive and kind. Large plots
17530,40229,3,pavelle,29/06/2015,"Quiet and shady campsite. Require to have a vehicle to join the start of hiking in Alquezard, a pretty village."
17570,3289682,3,Bliss365,12/09/2023,"Great campsite for exploring the city, very close to the sea. The bus stop to the city is on the main road (200 meters). The toilet block looks a bit Eastern Bloc. The costs are 15 euros per night for a camper with 2 people, including electricity."
17570,3289045,3,Ionegazta,12/09/2023,"The campsite is good, it is small and the pitches are large. Ours didn't have much shade. It's a shame it didn't have a pool. Mine stay of two nights. The bathrooms are very old, they could do with an arrangement... Two nights, two people and a Camper €25. Well priced."
17570,3287676,4,lilosa,12/09/2023,"very simple campsite, friendly welcome in French, clean toilets, bus at the entrance to the campsite for Porto in 20 minutes, supermarket nearby, laundry right next to the Lidl nearby, good value for money."
17570,3286293,4,Malaika17,11/09/2023,Good and above all cheap place. The showers are a bit spartan but ok. You can get to Ponte Luis in 30 minutes by bike (it's best to ride along the water because otherwise there's a lot of up and down)
17570,3284982,4,Joe_Monika,11/09/2023,"VERY nice reception and a place with shade. We initially pay for 2 days and can then stay for about 2 weeks, make a pilgrimage to the Way of St. James and then pay the reduced rate for this time - a really good offer. Showers and toilets reduced in Portuguese, but a safe, well-monitored place - ideal for us."
17570,3267926,3,marinaundandre,07/09/2023,"Minimum stay of 2 nights is correct. Because you can get to Porto cheaply and quickly with Uber, there is a good central station here. Bathrooms take some getting used to but are okay. What more could you want if you want to go into the city."
17570,3263997,3,j0nasw,06/09/2023,"The campsite is okay, the beach is a 5-minute walk away. You can also drive easily to Porto, Uber costs less than €10. However, the sanitary facilities are very old and partly broken. The staff is nice and helpful."
17570,3254679,1,Noukske3,03/09/2023,There were plenty of spots but we didn't make a reservation and said they were full
17570,3251374,5,latancheb,02/09/2023,"we spent 3 nights there close to the beach, convenient for visiting Porto. pleasant and multilingual staff. basic sanitary facilities but hot water and serviced every day. We were satisfied."
17570,3249313,2,hughJaynus,02/09/2023,"shower room has black mold everywhere and are not clean. cleaners use a weird bleach that is very strong and probably toxic. 
pitches are a reasonable size and staff are friendly. it feels safe and there is always someone on the front desk."
17570,3243485,5,slavkinvan,31/08/2023,"Very nice and helpful staff, big pitches, old but clean bathroom and showers. Direct bus from the camp to Porto Louis bridge, few minutes walk to a beautiful beach. Overall the campsite is a bit old but still convenient. Pay attention when navigating with Waze to take main roads and avoid too narrow alleys."
17570,3241120,3,riafrederickx,31/08/2023,"Book in advance by email and you will be warmly welcomed. The pitches are big enough. Conveniently located 200 m from the beach with bars and restaurants. We went to Porto by bike. 7 km along the coast, partly on cycle paths. Leave the bike on the other side of the Douro. Which is also a nice part to taste port. You can take the cable car over the bridge directly to the center"
17570,3232202,2,wyo95,28/08/2023,"Very cheap 9€ for 1 person with car and roof tent. Direct beach location. Unfortunately the bathroom is very dated and not clean. At least 2 days stay and you have to wait a long time to check in, you have to be patient here. WiFi is only available outside the parking lot, not on the campsite."
17570,3230160,4,touphi,28/08/2023,"book the day before by email. very warm welcome, in French! places us under a shadow! clean sanitary facilities, hot showers, quiet very early, everything is old fashioned but for €14 a day what more could you ask for! city center by Uber for 6€, 9€ on the way back (depending on the time)"
17570,3224928,3,m_irigo,27/08/2023,For the price they charge the campsite is not cheap. Large plots and clean services. But the people at the reception are real jerks...
17570,3223182,4,Fuchsloch,26/08/2023,"Not the friendliest at reception, but everything was clean and the pitches were big enough. Perfect for this price near Porto! We are for 7€ with UBER to Ponte Luis."
17570,3205978,5,Guidaa,23/08/2023,"Very friendly and helpful staff. Speak good English. You just have to be patient with their check-in system. Top location, old facilities but everything is clean. You should not expect a 5 star campsite for this money, then your stay will be great!"
17570,3205872,4,MIK3L,23/08/2023,"The friendliness of the staff, and the state of the showers and WC, will agree with the price. It does not come to 13 euros a day for 2 adults and two children with a van. For that price you can't ask for more."
17570,3201330,3,eliaure,22/08/2023,"The plus: the location near the beach, the direct bus (15) nearby for Porto, large well-defined pitches, hot water in the showers. The least: MUST book by email at least the day before, 2 nights minimum, unfriendly staff, dilapidated and poorly maintained sanitary facilities, little shade. 28€ for 2 nights with 2 adults in a van"
17570,3193444,3,LaKant33,21/08/2023,"Ideal location 50m from the beach with unbeatable value for money (€13.66 per night with 1 tent and 2 people). However, campsite in its own juice that deserves a good facelift. Toilets dating from the Soviet era but hot showers. Delimited plot. Forced to leave his car in the parking lot. We waited 45min before we could be seated. Staff not very pleasant."
17570,3186864,2,sarabara,20/08/2023,"City campsite. Large plots but with a lot of unevenness, old but clean bathrooms, that if there was a bathroom and a shower without a latch. The light jumps as soon as you plug something in. A 2-minute walk from the beach and 14 minutes from the center of Porto in Uber (€7)"
17570,3180455,1,TitiRafou,19/08/2023,Camping with obligation to book by email and minimum 2 nights. Home not very friendly. Very old and dirty toilets. The only positive point is the nearby beach and the ease of visiting the city (7€ for 4 people with an Uber)
17570,3176901,1,mariafcordero,18/08/2023,Very badly! We arrived with our confirmed reservation for 2 nights and upon arrival it was full. The man was very rude and told us that check-in ended at 7:00 p.m. and we arrived 10 minutes late. I really don't think that if we arrived at that time we would have our place.
17570,3173435,5,NicoGoub,18/08/2023,"Excellent value. €25 for 2 nights with a van, 2 adults and 2 teenagers aged 10 and 13, without electricity. beautiful beach nearby with restaurants. Sanitary not luxurious but clean and hot shower. nearby bus with direct line to the old bridge to visit Porto few services, no washing machine but priced accordingly."
17570,3173123,2,beajmr,18/08/2023,"Cold reception. Location ok. Very old toilets. There are no Germans, that's a sign! Positive point, nice restaurants 200 m on the beach, and bus 100 m which will take you to Porto in 20 minutes. Passage every 15 minutes."
17570,3155819,3,mariojsoares,15/08/2023,"This camping site is ok for the price. The camping site belongs to the public, and it needs a serious update in the infrastructure. The bathroom block is old, yes but clean. A lot of residents, but overall a good environment. To point out a very RUDE employee of the reception."
17570,3144282,4,campermollies,14/08/2023,"Perfect base to explore Porto. The sanitary facilities are outdated, but clean. You can easily (and cheaply) take a Bolt taxi from the campsite to the city. The campsite is super close to the beach, where there are also many nice restaurants. In the morning you walk to the delicious bakery on the corner for breakfast. The employees of the campsite are super helpful. 24 hour security. Only point of attention: email in advance and ensure confirmation. We had the feeling that otherwise they would not easily accept new campers. Below are reviews about low amps, we did have a place with 10. WiFi only behind reception."
17570,3140845,2,crocotrotter,13/08/2023,So yes the price is unbeatable to visit Porto (6€ by uber) and be close to the beach (well laid out and very pleasant) but you have to expect a more than unpleasant welcome...an organization from another time for place the people. The sanitary facilities are dilapidated although relatively clean... the 2A electricity is only used for the fridge... and certain parts of the campsite are abandoned.
17570,3129980,1,garreaucath,12/08/2023,"Very rude reception staff. Despite the reservation by email, makes us wait two hours in the parking lot without ever picking us up. Very poor organization. We went elsewhere. To flee !"
17570,3115506,3,LaurSan,10/08/2023,"Three stars just for its location! Convenient to visit Porto for 6€ with an Uber. Fairly spacious pitches but dilapidated sanitary facilities, some showers or toilets do not even close! This campsite lacks maintenance which is unfortunate because its location is very convenient. Reservation by email only."
17570,3111858,3,adria640prestige,10/08/2023,"Very mixed opinion. Reservation by email MANDATORY, then wait 1 hour in the car park before entering because their organization is just archaic. Once we got back, no choice of location, electricity max 2 A, and clean but very old sanitary facilities. 3 stars, for the price (fortunately) and the location."
17570,3108017,4,turtle19,09/08/2023,"Pleasant staff, for the reservation, no surprise it says so on the home page. 4 stars because just the sanitary facilities are clean but very old-fashioned and you can't choose your place. correct price for the place and ideal with ubert to visit Porto about 20 minutes away"
17570,3104547,1,SonyMar,08/08/2023,"Much better in all aspects. The way to enter is strange, only if you reserve by e-mail and after 2:00 p.m. Very old facilities with mediocre cleaning. The undefined plots and at least for us with a van they made us very tight. In favor only its location, it is very close to the beach and the bus stop with connection to the center of Porto."
17570,3098027,4,Andrea50,07/08/2023,"Excellent, book by email, take an Uber to the center and reception after 2:00 p.m. and be patient"
17570,3059544,5,marcealain,01/08/2023,"Excellent value for money, given the location! A word of advice, book by e.mail. The checking is long but the staff, although understaffed, is pleasant."
17570,3058008,3,jesusbarrera,01/08/2023,"It is a pity the state of abandonment that the campsite presents. Very old bathrooms without maintenance but very clean. The access system is lousy, you have to reserve by e-mail and check-in is not done until 2:00 p.m. even though the campsite is empty and the operators sit idly by. Perfect location to visit Porto, I recommend Uber leaves you at the San Luis bridge for only €7."
17570,3050956,5,ikaner,31/07/2023,"Perfect price quality. Hot water shower, clean, large spaces. Sinks may be a bit far from shaded areas. Some unevenness in plots. To go downtown Uber to Jardín Du Morro 6 to 6.50."
17570,3038237,2,valeratwin,29/07/2023,"old campsite, very old, but clean. You can't stay for one night, only for two or more, we had to pay for 2 days and live alone approximately 30 euros. does not have a visa, the staff did not go to the meeting. 150 meters to the ocean"
17570,3035077,4,barraultceline,28/07/2023,"Large pitches, including quite a few in the shade. There was still room for motorhomes even though we are in the middle of July. Allow time if no reservation. the price is worth it for the edge of the beach. The staff is friendly, you have to know how to talk to them. Took an uber to Porto."
17570,3028610,5,thibautdu81,27/07/2023,"Often full, it is better to arrive early at the campsite around 2 p.m. Nice campsite near Porto. We had a top location under the trees! We took a very reasonably priced uber to get to the center"
17570,3023329,5,victorAst,26/07/2023,"Cheap camping, €14 night. 300m. of the beach. Perfect 4G coverage. Very spacious plots and many of them with shade. Minimum stay of 2 nights"
17570,3021398,4,remii,26/07/2023,"There is shade (if you're lucky). There are enough sanitary facilities (even if downright outdated). There's the ocean and the cycle path... At 12 euros per night, near Porto, it's creamy!"
17570,3015452,3,van_madness,24/07/2023,"Very old place and in need of some renovation. Toilets clean but all toilets without glasses. The guide at the campsite was probably having a bad day, but we took it with humor. Perfect for a city trip to Porto. Best to order an Uber or Bolt."
17570,3014032,2,wholeofthemoon23,24/07/2023,"We stayed here for a couple nights to visit Porto. Food at the restaurant onsite was delicious and great value for €. However, check in took an hour & it felt unorganised. Sanitary facilities are cleaned daily, but no lids on the bins means there is an unpleasant aroma. Someone unfortunately let their dog defecate right in front of our door, which we then stepped on when coming home at night."
17570,3013946,3,JannesCordes,24/07/2023,Check-in takes about 1 hour. The place itself is ok. Very old. Electricity not entirely reliable toilet without toilet seat but better than no place at all. Definitely reserve in advance in summer
17570,3013109,3,lluuiiyy,24/07/2023,The old toilets are cleaned every day. The people at the reception are nice and willing to help. Good value for money.
17570,3012856,2,Babsi28,24/07/2023,"The check-in is always only possible at 2 p.m. and very unorganized. The pitches were fine, but what didn't work at all were the sanitary facilities. These are not only old but very dirty. In the 3 days we were there it wasn't even cleaned. The proximity to the city of Porto and the beach is positive."
17570,3010419,1,losKukus,23/07/2023,"the reception closes at 7:00 p.m. Check in from 2:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., the very narrow campsite for motorhomes of 590, shabby place to empty gray and black water, there is no paper in public services, electricity at 2A and we didn't even go and since there are no people at reception you can't complain. We don't come back."
17570,3002383,4,clarita,22/07/2023,"As the previous comments say, camping with old but functional facilities. It has the merit of having a bus stop, near the beach, supermarket. Ideal for us to leave the van and go quietly to Porto. The entire beach has a bike lane: fantastic to take a walk with the sea next to you. friendly staff"
17570,3001544,4,familyonwheels1234,22/07/2023,"Quiet site. Without swimming pool but with the sea at 200 m. Helpful staff. Very economical. Bathroom/shower facilities old but clean, hot water. We wrote an email 24 hours before and they reserved a place for us, minimum 2 nights. Ideal for visiting Porto. Bus stop (number 15) 50 m away, irregular frequency, takes 30 min; With the Moovit App you can organize yourself as it is very reliable. I recommend it!"
17570,2995446,3,lilydu33,21/07/2023,"Good for visiting Porto bus 15 at the corner of the street from the campsite for 1 € 90 takes you in 20 minutes in front of the Luis I bridge.... Very good reception in French... On the other hand if you take 10 amps, you will be on the side of the road which is very noisy during the day and also at night... Clean sanitary facilities with very hot water... Wifi only at the small café..."
17570,2993871,3,girox,20/07/2023,"The description in Italian is correct. The advice concerns public transport, line 15 is unreliable. We did the Andante card but we weren't able to use it, better to use the services of Bolt / Uber. It's really a pity that more is not invested in renovating this campsite, it could be better valued given the location. A little more kindness from the staff would not hurt"
17570,2991273,3,rems,20/07/2023,"Apart from an extremely unpleasant welcome by the receptionist and staff who have nothing to do with bothering you with a mower/brushcutter early in the day (by blowing up a windshield on the way), this campsite is very good. The sanitary facilities are from another age but still very clean. The price is very correct, i.e.: Van/tent/3 adults/3 children = 44€ per night. city 20min by bus"
17570,2980481,3,julgomo,18/07/2023,The location is perfect to visit Porto. Bolt or Uber for €5.5-€8 to go to the center. The facilities are very old and abandoned but its price is cheap €12.60 per night 1 camper and 2 adults. The staff a bit borderline and very grumpy.
17570,2976369,5,jok007,17/07/2023,"yes, toilets are pretty old and dirty, yes, some rules are strange, but I paid 43 euro for 3 nights for camper, 2 adults and 2 kids. Camping is just 5 minutes walk from the beach. For this price it is 5 stars. If I paid triple of it, I would give 3 stars"
17570,2967063,4,U.Do,15/07/2023,"Facilities old but all clean, unbeatable value for money from 17.50 euros. Some pitches with shade. Porto and beach in combination: great beach within walking distance, no problem with the dog on the beach. Booking 1-2 days in advance is an advantage and increases the success considerably, as many arrive and depart daily. We stayed 4 nights and enjoyed it."
17570,2960790,4,JanundAnja,14/07/2023,"We would have liked to give 3.5 stars. Basically fine, past its best, but a good location and absolutely fine for 2 nights at €28 for van and 2 people. And if the toilets are dirty, it's always the guests' fault! Our recommendation: Take the bike path (mainly and without inclines) along the coast to Porto by bike."
17570,2958258,5,sienenwarre,13/07/2023,"Price/quality fine. The two men at the reception are very friendly. We were allowed to choose where we wanted to stand. The plumbing is very old but in order. Always hot showers and two showers where you can regulate the temperature yourself. We took an Uber to Porto for 7 euros. For two nights with a 7-meter camper, 2 adults and two children and electricity, we paid 33 euros."
17570,2954017,3,TheMintBus,12/07/2023,"The location to Porto and the beach is positive. The staff is very friendly. Very lengthy check-in without reservation, although the campsite was almost empty. Reserved in advance, this might help you not having to wait forever in the parking lot to get in! Everything very unkempt, lawn very high, sanitary facilities old and moldy. Too bad, you could make so much out of this place."
17570,2940389,4,alexx0815,09/07/2023,"Unbeatable at the price! Yes, everything is a bit older and maybe not everything is perfect. But if you are passing through there is hardly anything better. I would definitely come back again!"
17570,2939498,3,JCPORFIRIO,08/07/2023,"Close to the sea, beach bars, restaurants and other services. A few minutes from Porto with our scooter. Some lots have 6 or 10 amp electricity for the same amount. Quiet at dawn, but less during the day/night (descending plane route and next to a busy road). Friendly and helpfull staff. Functional but basic facilities, run down and neglected. Economic stay."
17570,2939472,3,Bertafor2,08/07/2023,"Positive: quiet, Womo is safe, partly shady places, inexpensive, nice staff. Negative: toilets and showers old, dirty, partly moldy. Parcels unkempt, bus to Porto very irregular with long waiting times (better take Bolt, Uber or taxi) Spontaneous arrival not desired, only with prior reservation. Narrow tramlines on the square with high curbs."
17570,2936608,3,MIDz,08/07/2023,"The place is very far from the center, and public transportation is unreliable. Just a taxi. The place is quiet, but the toilet is dirty, especially in times of crisis when men commit their atrocities. This is because there are not enough toilets. Some of the staff do not speak a word of English."
17570,2923258,5,Mastaram,04/07/2023,"very nice, shady and good value.
must have reservation on the email. they don't accept without reservation for minimum stay of 2 nights."
17570,2915374,4,sergi68,02/07/2023,"The campsite is old, but for a couple of nights it's worth it... to see Porto, Uber €7.40 and it takes you to Porto... very old facilities, clean, and it has very good food to order and a good price, 1 chicken and large potatoes for 4, €11, l the beach 150 meters away, aaa and on July the 1st, eating with a jacket in the shade, the air is cool... camping in it"
17570,2904912,4,Fiore58,29/06/2023,All in all there is everything you need! You absolutely need to book via email otherwise you won't enter but the value for money is excellent considering that you have to stay 2 nights for around €33!! The only flaw is on the bus ... there are no timetables and you wait a lot !!
17570,2903114,4,gra_gp,29/06/2023,"The campsite is very good. Clean, shady sites. 2 adults, dog, 2 nights without electricity €26. The bus to the center takes 20-30min. Google maps doesn't work for the bus. Download the app, it is very reliable. Do not trust the schedules that appear on the official bus page, they do not coincide. You have to get off at the General Torres stop in the center of Porto."
17570,2902958,1,SylvieL56,28/06/2023,Old and dirty toilets. We are on top of each other. The electrical network seems to be faulty. The trash cans are overflowing! The icing on the cake payment only in cash and be careful check your bill.
17570,2896247,1,Lorenayedu,26/06/2023,"Camping super dejao, for not caring they don't even take care of cutting the grass in the plots, THERE IS NO STORE, THERE IS NO SWIMMING POOL... yes there is a lot of tranquility, the old xo clean bathrooms without a lock, the hot water showers with a lock, to get out of the step serves.. The bus stop 15 is a 2 'walk to visit Porto CENTER. old caravans abandoned there... Etc... NO WIFI only in the bar..."
17570,2894162,4,CamperlifeSundP,26/06/2023,"If you are looking for luxury, this is not the place for you, showers and toilets are more than rustic, with 2A electricity only the minimum is possible (no hair dryer, etc.) but the price-performance ratio is unbeatable! Ideal for a visit to Porto. Important: you MUST reserve, everyone without a reservation was rejected even though the place was not full."
17570,2890833,4,pepita972,25/06/2023,"Nice location, bathrooms are clean. On the other hand we could not make water. Close to Porto with Uber less than 10 euros. The self-service laundromat is over a kilometer away. The beach very close."
17570,2887189,4,leroy62,24/06/2023,I don't understand the last comment. We have just left the campsite after 2 nights there. The sanitary facilities look old indeed but they are clean and regularly cleaned. The shower water is hot. Ma only hot water for dishes only. The pitches are well marked out (watch out for lowered motorhomes because there is a small cobbled border to climb at each pitch. Close to the sea and the cycle path that leads to Porto. 10 meters from the bus stop that leads to Porto (1.90 euros / person and 30 min journey) Friendly staff who speaks French and English We paid 33 euros for 2 nights with electricity (2A only) Very secure (caretaker day and night).
17570,2884773,2,bobibouontheroad,23/06/2023,"The location of the campsite is the only positive point that gives it its interest. Apart from that, rather dirty sanitary facilities, pitches on top of each other and campsite not very well maintained. €50 in a tent for 2 nights without electricity in May."
17570,2882193,5,msbulli,22/06/2023,Great location for the beach and Porto. 20 minutes by bike along the beach to Porto old town. Bus right in front of the campsite. Price-performance top. Sanitary old but always very clean.
17570,2864169,5,gilou1957,17/06/2023,"very good, close to the bus to visit Porto,"
17570,2848146,1,Davidpe1984,12/06/2023,"Not recommended, we waited 30 minutes for an allocation and nothing happened. My girlfriend had to go to the toilet (luckily) and after that we decided to drive because of the lack of cleanliness!"
17570,2843739,1,RudolfERNST,11/06/2023,"Even if the campsite is half empty at 2 p.m., the boss allocates the pitch without responding to requests. If you're unlucky, you'll be standing to the left of the entrance gate and won't even be able to use the awning! The high, sharp-edged granite curbs are tire killers. Also, be careful not to scald the children under the much too hot shower. 10 A current partly available."
17570,2827733,4,schalkeontour,07/06/2023,"Great location, 2 minutes walk to the sea and 20 minutes by bus to Porto. Bus stop directly at the campsite, ride costs 2 € pp. Sanitary facilities clean and the staff nice and helpful. The only catch: only 2AP electricity, which is why the fuse blows quickly. Paid €17 per night for 2 people, Bulli + electricity, highly recommended. Possibly the day before mail with reservation."
17570,2806971,5,AWW91,31/05/2023,"Value for money. You can either take the bus directly to Porto (the bus stop is right next to the campsite) or you can cycle along the sea. Sanitary houses are getting old, but were very clean. Staff very friendly!!"
17570,2787027,5,hannah339,26/05/2023,Great for the price. I pay €8.75 per night for me and my dog on the bus. If you want luxury is wrong here. But for this price - you can't say anything!
17570,2785652,3,tassietravelers,25/05/2023,"Location and price very good for this campsite. So easy to get to Porto on the 15 bus, and the beach is a real treat. Parts of the campsite are quite nice, but we were in the overgrown area with a wrecked caravan next door, and a dead rat by the power box. If you can overlook that, book ahead (they were turning people away the day we arrived) and hope for one of the better kept pitches."
17570,2781606,5,Haderlump63,24/05/2023,"I like this campsite! I've been here for a week now and I feel really comfortable. The staff is super nice and I like the mischievous Portuguese humor! It is wonderful to cycle the 10 km along a cycle path along the sea to Porto, the bus line 15 to Porto stops right in front of the campsite. But please reserve in advance, one day in advance is enough."
17570,2773440,3,maxgent,21/05/2023,"The campsite is perfect for visiting Porto. Honest price. The problems are the long wait for check-in and the quality of services, very dated."
17570,2769020,5,gretawgn,20/05/2023,"Really a great place. We stayed here for 3 nights with two adults, electricity and a bus and paid €44. Sanitary facilities are fine. Owner really very nice."
17570,2768817,5,diekiri,20/05/2023,Great stay for two nights (at least). Shower and toilet available - not the newest but perfectly adequate. Great location on the beach and also if you want to go to downtown Lagos (Uber tip for €6).
17570,2763218,4,GabyRipoli,19/05/2023,"We paid €25 for two nights, two adults with a car and a tent on the roof. Without eleectricity. It is not allowed to pull the cable and leave it exposed. Only Motorhomes can use electricity. In any case, they charged our cell phones both nights at reception. A lot of wind, we had to change plots."
17570,2756797,4,FemBisonBlanc,17/05/2023,easy to access near the sea and shops along the beach. The campsite is dilapidated and noisy in the evening because there are people all year round. planes pass overhead. but for the price there is no doubt to have 2 nights with electricity 25 € and 45 minutes from Porto by bus < 2 € ... well you have to be patient here.
17570,2756423,4,Claue78,17/05/2023,"We recommend. Perfect spot to visit Porto. As already said: the place and the facilities are a bit old, but functional and clean. By bike it is about 9 km to Ponte Luiz I - along the Atlantic and the Douro (a recommended 'entry' to Porto). For the price (~45 euros, 2 people, 3 nights with electricity) and location, you can't ask for more in my opinion."
17570,2750319,3,janoderso,14/05/2023,"You should check in with a dose of serenity. The staff does their thing, no matter how many impatient campers want to get in quicker. Not cordial but honest + correct. Reasonably priced (€16 with electricity + 2 children). Lawn not perfectly mowed ;-) great bike ride along the beach to town. It's worth making a reservation then you don't have to stand in line (we observed)."
17570,2735595,1,Renesegura,09/05/2023,"We wanted to stay in the outdoor car park for one night, someone from the campsite agreed. An hour later another angry person told us to get out."
17570,2734036,4,Tartuff,08/05/2023,"It's not the prettiest of campsites, but really cheap and very well located 5min from the beach, 15-20min from the center of Porto, ~8Eur by Uber. Friendly staff, dated but functional and clean facilities. 2 nights minimum, remember to book or not arrive too late, they must refuse every evening in the world (early May)."
17570,2725157,5,Phill87,05/05/2023,"Cheap place, 25€ for 2 nights with electricity. Showers and toilets very old and rancid but clean and unlimited hot water. 3 minutes walk to the sea and 5 minutes to the supermarket. 7€ with the Uber to the center. We recommend the place!"

17570,2716138,3,biyogi,02/05/2023,"Very basic campsite, old facilities (bathrooms without toilet paper, you have to bring the paper). neglected parcels; very tall grass and short trees. It meets the value for money, they require 2 nights but we stayed for 1 and they only charged us 1 (motorhome 2 people and 1 dog €15). You pay what it is. Dogs over 10kg prohibited on public transport (UberPet for €10 to the center of Porto)."

17570,2710789,3,VerCort,30/04/2023,"Very simple campsite, a little olé olé... clean sanitary facilities, hot showers. Close to the beach and close to the bus stop for Porto. About 20-30 mins from the center of Porto. Pitch either quite close to each other, or quiet among annual pitches. In April it's quiet, the locals aren't there. Ideal for visiting Porto and above all not expensive."

Impeccable. The boss is olé olé.. He knows how to tell you that he is the chef and he is the one who places you.. Hot shower, address to remember. 2 nights mandatory"

17570,2699352,4,sonnybuddy,26/04/2023,"I mean it's alright - can't complain. Great location for cycling into Porto. You'll need your leveling blocks to get over the kerb onto the pitch, the electric hook up will just about keep the lights on and I've stayed in prisons with better showers."
17570,2697099,3,dfx1,25/04/2023,"Very old sanitary facilities, dingy. Rather noisy, even at night (but that probably depends on the location of the pitch). The sea with nice restaurants can be reached in 5 minutes. min. 2 nights. Good starting point for a visit to Porto; reachable with Uber in 20min for EUR 7."
17570,2694505,3,RaffaeleCicca,24/04/2023,"What to say!? It reflects the standard of Portugal. Campsites always 30 to 40 minutes away from the centers of interest. Outdated facilities even if clean enough. Weaknesses: only 2 Amps; strong point: stop on the outward journey with bus n. 15 to approx. 60 meters. I always return with the same bus but it stops at the terminus. along the sea, approx. 300 meters from the campsite, except for the driver"
17570,2694031,4,Roxymi,24/04/2023,Ideal place to park the motorhome to visit Porto. 23.50 euros 2 nights with electricity and dog. Very calm. The bus to Porto 100 meters away. THANKS. At 200 meters let's stay.

17570,2686942,4,eseceeme,22/04/2023,Great campsite to stay around Porto. Friendly staff. The girls in reception speak main European languages. Services a bit outdated but great value for money! The taxi to Porto around 12€. Walking distance to the beach with lots of bars.

17570,2676991,4,Martybhoy,17/04/2023,April '23.  Bottom line - this place is fantastic value for money !  and lets face it when you stay here it will be to visit the beautiful city of Porto. Yes the site especially the grass is unkempt and the facilities are not the newest but it's safe and secure for 11€ a night. Some people want perfection for the least amount of money. We would still stay because of the security and bus link alone
17570,2675496,5,MichelSimian,16/04/2023,"unbeatable value for money, top pitches with greenery, clean sanitary facilities, hot water, respectful welcome, bus to Porto center 100 m away, all that for 16.5€ for 2 nights (2 nights minimum), what more could you ask for!!"
17570,2669662,5,Cerisegolf,14/04/2023,"2 nights (minimum stay), 2 people and a van for €16.73. The correct staff. The facilities are very simple but functional and clean. The plots are spacious but are not mowed often. The bus to Porto (timetable at reception) takes 20 minutes. You can also walk along the coast (2h). In summary, a modest and comfortable option to get to know Porto, without any excess or serious deficiencies."
17570,2663455,5,MagsBere,12/04/2023,"Terrific little gem of a site.  Friendly welcome, Showers work well and the water is nice and hot.  Laundry sinks are very large.  Grassy pitches with or without electric and a variety of levels of that too.   Bus stop along the road for visiting Porto and the fares are not expensive. Secure site, so you feel your unit is safe while you’re out"

It is true that the bathrooms are very old, but they do their job and are usually always clean. When we return to Porto we will come back!"
17570,2648052,5,Hedvan,07/04/2023,"We loved our stay here. From the first contact via mail - professional and quick answers. Very friendly staff - all very helpful - 5 nights - yes the showers /sanitary bathrooms are outdated - but everything works - and nice that it’s not modern - sometimes the simplicity is the most beautiful. Here you find spring flowers in bloom, fruit trees and lots of green grass. Keep up the good work and don’t change anything. Amazing beaches 200 meters with sunsets that are mind blowing. Dogs are welcome. ? Thank you."
17570,2644709,4,TaylorAhlstrom,06/04/2023,Perfect place to stay to visit Porto. Not sure why so many ppl are saying it's old and dirty. The bathrooms are not luxurious but fine for a campsite and very clean. People were all super friendly and the beach right there is stunning. We paid €20 for two nights with van and electric. the bus does run to porto but it was very unreliable so we took Uber instead (about €7 each way). 100% recommend.
17570,2644455,1,philcat86,06/04/2023,"ideal campsite to stay for a few days while being about 20 minutes by bike from Porto, along the coast, without danger. we had left our bikes on the Praia side because Porto was very hilly.

17570,2636415,4,ThomasZ.,02/04/2023,"An addition to the other statements: depending on the wind and weather conditions, the place is in the approach path of the airport. Overflight altitude is still bearable. Very good cycling connection on marked paths along the coast and river to Porto (20km return)."
17570,2636385,5,exparkpert,02/04/2023,"Nice reception, good location. Yes, the sanitary facilities are getting old, but for the price (7€/night: caravan, 2 people and dog) you really can't complain. Have a nice stay."
17570,2619090,3,Anatole22,21/03/2023,Cheap camping. 10€50 per night with 3A electricity. Minimum 2 nights. Proximity to the seafront. The pitches are not very well maintained but when camping because this is not a problem. The toilets are basic but clean. Very good value for money. To go to Porto we had problems with line 15. We used UBER for our trips.
17570,2615716,5,Sham90,19/03/2023,"Good campsite which allows you to visit Porto without difficulty with the bus. The welcome is friendly, the toilets are clean and functional. Reading some of the reviews, I expected much worse. 10.54€ for a CC of 6m, 1 person for two nights, nothing to complain about."
17570,2612397,5,bella6644,17/03/2023,"Very, very friendly welcome in French. In this campsite they care a lot about our 4-legged friends. Camping is simple, but perfect.

17570,2609256,3,MariaG.,14/03/2023,"There is actually everything, but outdated. Showers are hot, maybe too hot for sensitive people. There are a few cats. The staff was friendly throughout. Bus 1.95 to Porto Pets 0.53 WoMo 6m 3.71 Tax 0.50. Low season March. Totally okay for a few days and great price. I would not stay 2 weeks. The beach promenade is very nice!"
17570,2601921,2,lavacaenruta,07/03/2023,"The campsite could be much better with some renovation, it's a shame because it has a lot of possibilities. Very calm. The attention of the man who was there when we arrived left a lot to be desired; It was 7:45 p.m. And he didn't let us in because he said it was closed and he made us park in the parking lot next to the entrance. We entered the next day and paid almost €21 for one night."
17570,2599768,1,Monesg,05/03/2023,"One star because the female employees were all very friendly. Except for the colleague with the longer hair, who reprimanded you immediately if something didn't go according to his rules. Best not to get in his way. Too bad the place would have potential due to its proximity to Porto. Unfortunately no working WiFi and the access roads for mobile homes are very narrow."
17570,2590443,4,leilathebuskingvan,25/02/2023,"Affordable and friendly campsite, nice people on reception who help you to hook up to their electric. Close to the beach, 15 bus into Porto just outside. Bathrooms a bit tired but the water is hot and facilities are all there.

17570,2581254,4,Trottie,17/02/2023,"Great price; nice that you can take the cheaper 2A rate. We were allowed to choose our own place and were then electrically connected by the correct and friendly managers. The campsite is far enough from the coast road not to hear it, but the sea with a beautiful beach is a few minutes' walk away, and you can cycle to Porto in no time. Sanitary is dated but clean. 4 bars 5G."

17570,2573509,4,laurentber,10/02/2023,we appreciated this campsite for its proximity to the beach 150m and to Porto 20 minutes by bike along the ocean and the Douro on a cycle path. certainly a little dated but hot shower clean sanitary all this for 14 euros 2 nights (minimum).. we were in a van for 2 people without electricity. in conclusion a good plan to visit this very pretty city of Porto.
17570,2560741,3,Ella-B.,26/01/2023,"The campsite is a few minutes' walk from the beach and the bus stop is also nearby. Take line 15 to the terminus, from here it is not far to the old town. The campsite is to say that it is a closed area with a few trees. Of course, the sanitary facilities leave a lot to be desired, but they are clean. Friendly operators"
17570,2558718,3,tehonu,23/01/2023,"Dilapidated and borderline dilapidated but fairly clean sanitary facilities. We will have to invest otherwise it will look like an abandoned camp.

Recommended for visiting Porto."

17570,2437097,3,cellojule,11/10/2022,Everything as described by predecessors. With me have the 2A? not even enough to operate the charger of my mobile home.
17570,2437071,5,MatthiasTeu,11/10/2022,Very cheap campsite! The sanitary facilities were typically Portuguese rustic but always clean. Hot water available! By scooter you can take a great way along the coast to Porto (~2.5€) and for the nightly way back you can take an Uber for about 10€. So far the best campsite in Portugal in terms of value for money.
17570,2436750,2,Sysyl,11/10/2022,"Messy, outdated but sanitary reasonably clean. Power is limited, not a problem for us but something to keep calculators because electric hob, kettle, etc. is not possible."

17570,2429646,4,BjoernBrenner,07/10/2022,We stayed 3 nights. The space is sufficient for a city trip. The bus (line 15) leaves every 30 minutes. The bus stop is right next to the campsite. The beach is 300m away. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The sanitary facilities are very old.
17570,2429644,4,Nataliexhaas,07/10/2022,"Perfect for a short stay! We spent three nights at the campsite. The toilets and showers are a bit old. The beach is in the immediate vicinity, the sunset is fantastic there. To get to the city you have to take bus number 15, unfortunately sometimes it didn't come. Possibly plan a little more time for booked things :)"

Downtown Porto can be reached within 30 minutes by line 15 (€1.90 each way) and the bus stop is right in front of the square. It is enough to look at Porto…"
17570,2427787,5,PierreNamen,06/10/2022,"Really basic campsite, cheap toilets, a little bit cramped spaces and a lot of cute stray cats. But it's a safe place to park in Porto and it is extremely cheap. we paid 8€ per night. You get what you pay for but I think it's a great fair deal!"

The restaurant on the square is awesome, very friendly waitresses (even if they hardly spoke English) and the food was great!"
17570,2422107,3,Tripower,04/10/2022,It is enough to visit the city. The place is apparently no longer maintained. The showers are ok. No toilet paper. You can get to the beach easily. A bus goes into town in front of the door. WiFi is only available near the reception.
17570,2419491,3,park4night15081954,02/10/2022,Not very warm welcome. A lot of waiting to register and waiting again to be placed… positive point we went by the cycle path which runs along the sea to visit Porto. We spent 2 nights there (obligatory) Obsolete but clean sanitary facilities and hot showers… Difficult to cross our pitch with a sidewalk that is much too high. Things to review….

A little dilapidated but for me very good"
17570,2410373,1,Moby67,28/09/2022,Terrible organisation led to the reception opening at 2pm and large queue waiting to be checked in and very stressed people. Waited for 3/4 hour and left and unwilling to wait for what looked like a very average site. Business around Porto allowing them to get away with this behaviour.

Good starting point for a visit to Porto. The bus to Porto stops almost directly at the site. Short walk to the beach, about 150m. There are several beach bars and restaurants. There is also a well-stocked supermarket about 500m away (beach promenade)."
17570,2402292,2,anmarmal,25/09/2022,"Very mixed reviews on this large campsite. Cramped pitches accessed by crossing a curb. Watch out for the tires! Very old toilets. No hot water in the sinks, washing-up tubs or laundry, but the showers are hot. Badly maintained land. Positive points: the bus stop next to the campsite to visit Porto and the friendliness of the staff."
17570,2401385,2,MandyLin,25/09/2022,"We can't quite understand the very positive reviews. The connection and the location to the sea is great, the showers were hot. The price is ok for that. However, there are also some points that should be worked on: in order to be able to drive onto the parcel, a high curb must be overcome; Long-term campers blast the neighbors with loud radios; extremely loud and constant dog barking (also at night); many cats that make themselves comfortable on their own garden chairs and also have their litter box on site; at moderate load the fuse blows and no more power is available; the groundskeeper is relatively unfriendly; the toilets are without toilet seat, you have to bring your own toilet paper; the disposal of the chemical toilet is special and was damn disgusting; There was no hose connected to fill the water, you have to have that and the appropriate adapter with you."
17570,2398873,4,aite,24/09/2022,"Very cheap, 2 nights, 2 people and van less than €25, price according to the facilities. Old but clean toilet/shower facilities. The worst thing is check in, it doesn't start until 2pm and it's poorly organized, it's better to arrive around 4-5pm and not wait! To go to Porto there is bus 15 that stops at the door. Beach a few meters from the campsite."
17570,2397155,3,Rosybazu,23/09/2022,"You have to come with all your patience, because they take it very calmly. We arrived at 2:15 p.m. we had 5 people in front of us and until 4:00 p.m. they did not give us the plot. The bathrooms and showers are from another era, although at first glance it seems that they are clean."

17570,2385987,2,Globebus74,19/09/2022,Home not terrible at all. If you arrive in the morning you must wait until 2:00 p.m. to check in. Noisy campsite and poor location. You must spend a minimum of 2 nights but it is a base for visiting Porto
17570,2382363,5,magdalenaliebmann,18/09/2022,"Nice campsite. Sanitary facilities are relatively old, but very clean. Great value for money. About 20 minutes from Porto by bus (line 15)."
17570,2381935,3,frankmann2,18/09/2022,"Everything negative has already been said and I can agree with that. The positive is the very nice staff that got us a taxi, which takes our dog. So we could easily look at Porto. The location to the beach and the promenade are perfect. Ideal for a trip by bike on the developed bike path on the coast."
17570,2380945,2,mawui79,17/09/2022,"The best thing is that it is very cheap, €15 a night for two people and a Camper. Very calm. Old and neglected facilities. Bad organization, to enter you have to go at 14 and queue. Then they take you to the plot and they connect you to the current, they only give you 2Amp, insufficient to connect, for example, a coffee maker. To go out with the caravan for a walk you have to leave €20 at reception.w"
17570,2377902,1,Sivi6573,16/09/2022,"Plagued with cats. Archaic and neglected bathrooms, although clean, but without paper. Curb on the plots. Total chaos at check-in and check-out. Unpatient staff. Planes fly by all the time (even at dawn). Very fair entry, you have to maneuver. Minimum 2 nights. 2 people, caravan and light €30/2 nights. The light can only with the fridge and one light, with more things the automatic jumps."
17570,2365134,1,RainerBrunken,12/09/2022,"Absolutely disappointed with this place. Rocked out, unkempt, sanitary facilities a disaster, the washing machine turns out to be a concrete scratch board from a bygone era. Sad."

17570,2289974,4,Pros-du-camping,23/08/2022,Excellent value for money to visit Porto. Attention cats in freedom therefore excrement not picked up. There is no more washing machine. Better to take an Uber than the taxi suggested at the reception and be dropped off at Pillar on the Nova de Gaia side then cross to Porto by the bridge.

17570,2205543,2,GuidoGianni,09/08/2022,Badly organized campsite. You must arrive at 2pm to check in and hope that there is a seat by queuing for 1 hour. There is the possibility to send an email to book but the email address is only visible at the reception! obligation to book at least 2 nights. Careless pitches and unpolite neighbors who turn on barbecues and nobody says anything. Positive point: the showers are hot!

17570,1945633,1,hoh_max,04/06/2022,"Very narrow pitches, showers and toilets so old and disgusting that you have to do this in the camper. The best is yet to come: minimum 2 nights and 1 night in LOW SEASON costs 38 euros for 2 adults and 2 children. One of the worst CPs here, although the standard here is already very low."
17570,1944641,2,BerndRudde,04/06/2022,"Two stars! Maximum! One for the price (29.20 without electricity for 2 people/2 nights/1 mobile home), the other for the good connection to the city (1.90//people/trip). The rest is in serious need of renovation! Just a classic compromise place!"
17570,1932936,3,Brestan,30/05/2022,"Professional reception. 17€/day including electricity for campers + 2 people. Sanitary outdated but clean. Toilets without glasses and paper. We were lucky enough to get a shadeless sandy area on the hottest day so far after the awning was broken, which turned out to be a highly frequented litter box. Advantages near the beach, bus to Porto, restaurant, infrastructure. Disadvantages Aircraft noise at night, barking, cats."
17570,1932182,1,JEOS,30/05/2022,"Not recommended! Sanitary is junk and the campsite is like a garbage dump. However, the staff was friendly, so one star."
17570,1931835,3,mailisest,30/05/2022,"Rudimentary campsite, friendly welcome, speaks French. Minimal but does the job. 2 nights minimum: 2 adults and a van €29.20"
17570,1927899,1,IsidreJL,29/05/2022,"They force you 2 days even if you are one. They charge you €1/person and day of tourist flush, the dible q in other campsites. You use electricity and they only give you 2 amps, totally insufficient. There are many booths covered by gray awnings of permanent inhabitants. Horrifying. The worst camping I have been in Portugal."
17570,1924415,2,emejota,28/05/2022,"Very shabby but well located. There are many ""permanent"" caravans. Minimum 2 days tbe in May. 17'50 € / day motorhome and 2 pax."
17570,1919183,3,proacecross,26/05/2022,Campsite well located for visiting Porto (bus 15 very close. Correct installation and sanitary facilities. Organizational problem for the outing (1 hour wait) no possibility of paying the day before and of being disconnected before having paid !!! 2 nights obligatory Correct price 33.86 with Van and 2 adults.
17570,1911923,4,Symba01,24/05/2022,Pleasant campsite. Very convenient to visit Porto with the number 15 bus practically at the door of the campsite. Very good adjoining restaurant (la casa Helena).
17570,1907293,2,MAGSII,22/05/2022,"As other commentators have said, old infrastructure with old tents from permanent campers. Reception impersonal. Access to disposal with a large vehicle very difficult. Current (2A) constantly fails. There are better places around. With the 15 bus to the old town is OK. Be careful on the way back. It only runs every hour and no arrival times are given."
17570,1907122,4,JpJac4947,22/05/2022,"Perfect for visiting Porto, beach 5' away and bus N 15 3' away on foot, then after 20' stop before the bridge, you cross on foot with a superb view of Porto and Gaïa. We are at the center. Clean, quiet and very secure campsite but not modern. 2 night minimum 18,€50 with electricity per night. In May 2022."
17570,1906945,2,MTheresMueller,22/05/2022,"Large campsite with very outdated infrastructure (sanitary facilities but very clean) and extremely complicated registration procedure, both for arrival and departure. Lots of stray cats. Bus number 15 to Porto just around the corner."
17570,1903290,3,Gradenecker,20/05/2022,"The campsite is a bit run down and the sanitary facilities are old but clean. There is only cold water for washing dishes, but I almost scalded myself in the shower. Dozens of cats live on the square and the gray tents of the long-term tenants are reminiscent of pictures from refugee camps. The location for sightseeing is very good and the bottom line is the price is right."
17570,1886850,3,reschima,13/05/2022,"Simple, clean campsite close to the beach. We took the bus into the city of Porto for €1.9 per person. Duration about 25 minutes. Staff friendly, sanitary facilities old but clean. Pitch large, but narrow driveway and paths on the site, we saw some campers who drove to signs or electrical boxes. Minimum stay 2 nights, 37€ with electricity."
17570,1880729,4,miketmarina,10/05/2022,"Difficult to access with a 12-meter coach, it's okay if there aren't too many people. Very friendly welcome."
17570,1880469,5,utzaki,09/05/2022,I was 100% satisfied and my expectations were far exceeded. What do some reviewers expect here for around 10 euros a night? Sanitary was clean. The continuously guarded gate gave me a good feeling of security. The plots are relatively large. The beautiful beach close. i would come back
17570,1870572,4,maslex1975,05/05/2022,"Great place, secure with gates. We lost 34 euros for 2 days. Hot shower and electricity. We didn't need more because we spent the whole day in Porto. Accessible by bicycle, electric scooter or bus that stops in front of the campsite"
17570,1865510,2,vickyt,02/05/2022,"Has all the basics you need for a couple of nights but looks like it hasn't been looked after for years. A sea of grey semi permanent tents and dirty buildings. Toilets and showers adequate but not worth more than the €12 per night. No washing machines. Close to Porto via bus and next to a nice beach with lots of cafes, restaurants and good cycle path."
17570,1864258,3,Didi686,01/05/2022,Good for visiting Porto and parking safely. Needs a refresh. Not really a place that makes you want to stay there for a long time
17570,1856544,3,Logusi,27/04/2022,"There's enough space... The lady at reception takes some getting used to, speaks English like a sergeant. Price for 2 people and bully for 2 days 22, -€, you can't say anything about that. Sanitary facilities functional, but nothing more. Beach 2min walk."
17570,1854162,1,french_driver,26/04/2022,"Minimum 2 N. The courses are bordered with stone curbs, which is not exactly good for the tyres. Current only for 2 amps. Neglected and pretty run down. Dirty sanitary facilities, that's how I imagine prison, showers and toilets. You shouldn't stay long. staff was friendly. We would not come back and cannot recommend it either."
17570,1853317,3,catetphiphi50,26/04/2022,for 12 euros it's just what you need because hot water only in the old sanitary showers locations not easy to access sidewalk height but the positive is the nearby bus to visit Porto and bike path to Villa de Gaia to do absolutely
17570,1850214,4,arno252,24/04/2022,Cheap campsite (1cc 2adults 2children electricity)/2days. 26€ Clean and hot showers. Beach nearby and Porto by Uber for 7€. I recommend!
17570,1848889,3,SlavCitro,23/04/2022,"convenient, close to the beach and the line 15 to Porto is very handy, however facilities are pretty run down and they have some weird rule that you have to pay at minimum 2 night stay."
17570,1848698,3,TravelThyme,23/04/2022,"Convenient. Close to the beach front with some very nice restaurants and a great board walk. 
The park really needs an update. Although the bathrooms are clean, they really need some maintenance and updating. There are some permanent caravans that needs maintenance and is an eyesore"
17570,1845890,4,FaxePoessl,22/04/2022,"Everything you need is there on the pitch. All facilities are old, but clean. Bus connection to the city, about 1km away. Cheap and guarded."
17570,1843208,5,sumace50,21/04/2022,Beautiful place close to the coast and its bars and restaurants and 30 minutes by bike from the historic center of Porto. Or else there is the bus right next to it…
17570,1843071,3,gajettelaiv,21/04/2022,"We paid 10.50€ per night (van, two people, no electricity, one dog). It was Easter weekend so it was quite noisy at times with lots of people and smoke from barbeques. Certainly not a relaxing place to stay and the staff seems fairly disorganized, but it had all we needed at a great price. 30 min by bike to Porto."
17570,1835711,3,arsame,18/04/2022,"Practical and functional to be able to visit the city of Porto without worrying about anything. The bus number 15 at the entrance of the campsite for €2 and in 20-25 minutes leaves you in Porto next to the Luis I bridge. It has a beautiful promenade with many restaurants nearby. Otherwise old and very basic facilities. The staff are correct but not friendly. €12.6 2 adults, van, taxes and electricity"
17570,1833068,5,Abuelo,18/04/2022,"Perfect campsite to see the city, taxi for €10 or Bus €2. There is a beautiful walk along the beaches in the area. I recommend it"

17570,1812560,5,Taminski,09/04/2022,"Super nice CP that allows all wishes. I asked for a spot a little further away as I had two cats with me. Anyone who has nothing against cats is welcome here. Approximately (counted) 10 live on the CP. Otherwise a good shower, but the water contains chlorine!! Pleasant, quiet CP, except for the planes. About 200m from the sea."
17570,1812136,3,jon74,09/04/2022,"very friendly and helpful campsite staff, it is true the comments that the toilets are old and only a shower and toilet center but clean and large, very hot water and the temperature cannot be regulated, the places are quite large, I let you think what want only one thing, €32 for two nights 2 people 2 cars 1 caravan."
17570,1807694,1,AnetaMichal,05/04/2022,"Unfortunately we can not give a note ZERO.  You will afraid to go to toilet or take a shower. Never see place so dull and unkempt. For more than 20€ for 2 persons in off season we can except more. Electricity second day is not working. Coming here you need to bring something to drive on, because the places are limited by granite edges more than 10 cm high ( or spare tyre set)"
17570,1804245,1,jlpetit,02/04/2022,arrived around 12 p.m. the manager forces us to take 2 days minimum and we are 2 motorhomes out of the question we only need to stay one night !! he offers me to pay 2 nights but if I want I can leave the next day is that that this campsite takes tourists for pigeons go your way there are 5 other more welcoming campsites nearby
17570,1803311,4,lr110ht,01/04/2022,"Super CP to visit Porto. By bike about 30 minutes. Can be done without any problems. The place itself, yes, a bit old and could use a little more care. But the sanitary facilities are clean and the showers are hot... All of that for about 18 euros for 2 nights without electricity. What more do you want."
17570,1795411,5,CINZIAontheROAD,26/03/2022,"Competitive price that makes you accept only 2 amperre of current and a not excellent unloading / loading area. Large grass pitches also flirtatious, adequate sanitation and many sources of water. Nice place and kind staff. If you have pets, they ask you for a passport and pay (very little). Convenient for the beach and clubs and markets a few steps from the bus stop to Porto."
17570,1787172,4,sarahtravellife,18/03/2022,"The campsite was really great, it was very busy but still quiet. The sanitary facilities were super clean, but already old. There is no WiFi. Draining the space for the water was a bit of a challenge, since English isn't really a language on the pitch. But luckily the nice gentleman showed us on foot where to go. We paid €18.60 for 2 nights without electricity, which is more than okay."
17570,1782962,4,KellyyMiguel,14/03/2022,"Good camping and very cheap, €11 per night motorhome and 2 people in March. The bathrooms are very clean, although they are old construction. It has a spectacular restaurant attached to the reception building but with access from outside the campsite. Very close to the beach and with a bus stop to Porto next to the campsite, line 15. Very quiet and very friendly staff."
17570,1781093,5,Jmrl,12/03/2022,My opinion !!! Extraordinary value for money... Outdated campsite but in cc what we ask c security to visit around here in this case Porto... You can drain and fill up with water... The plus. .. the beach nearby with cycle path and the bus to Porto at the exit of the land (15) thank you for existing... Obrigado

17570,1769196,5,daniyumpro,28/02/2022,"Good campsite to visit the centre of Porto, it is cheap and well located (we paid 18€ 2 days, 2 people).

17570,1758723,5,MarkenRuth,17/02/2022,"Very affordable for the facilities and distance to the old center of Porto or the beach. In February hot showers, free water and waste water supply. There is security for your motorhome or caravan: the gate is locked and you enter with your pass. Line 15 does take time so keep that in mind, you will come directly to the Douro while leaving your belongings safely behind."

17570,1724786,3,AlbaLopez,03/01/2022,Very quiet campsite. Near Porto and 5 minutes walk to the beach. Outdated but clean facilities. We stayed one night in fur but we were not advised that the minimum was 2 nights! Keep it in mind! It cost us 16eur for 2 adults and a child (they don't pay) in a van. Price for 2 nights.
17570,1709744,3,momoswildlife,14/12/2021,Practical to make a Porto excursion. Bus route 15 not far away. The beach can be reached in 200m. The sanitary facilities are quite old but functional. We stayed for 3 nights and paid 32 euros

17570,1695307,3,Rasjahcor,21/11/2021,Well located to visit Porto and a beautiful promenade next to it with atmosphere and beach bars. The men who wear it are super friendly and the price is very affordable. The facilities have seemed outdated and somewhat neglected. Some pitches quite uneven and require you to stay two nights. Difficult to get around the campsite with large AC's.
17570,1693766,4,Lauravenard,20/11/2021,"Very friendly campsite, very good value for money (16.10 per night with electricity and all services), friendly and welcoming staff! The sanitary facilities are clean and the shower water is hot (just be careful to respect the Covid rules in the sanitary facilities, the person in charge of hygiene is not friendly). The metro to go to Porto is 3km near the Fashion Outlet, you pay to order an Uber a 3e to get there or go there on foot (35min) it's very convenient."

17570,1690255,4,LesMartibert,15/11/2021,Great campsite! We were able to park where we wanted in the lawn path that was allocated to us. The sanitary facilities are quite old but clean and functional.

All for not even 18 € / 2 nights (without elec).

17570,1642747,4,svenvos86,13/10/2021,Great campsite to stay for a multi-day visit to Porto. Good and economical connection by bus or taxi to the city.

17570,1585093,4,Tigomgom,17/09/2021,"Not very pretty towards the back where there are old tents and caravans from the 80s. Apart from this the campsite is doing the service. A single point for emptying black water. Not found or empty gray water? Be careful if you have a hunter animal, there is a swarm of wild cats in the camp!"
17570,1584288,4,lucas4425,16/09/2021,Well equipped and inexpensive. I'm just missing the WiFi. Very convenient for visiting downtown Porto and the surrounding area.
17570,1581396,4,Joffrik,15/09/2021,Just a great campsite for your visit to Porto. Public transport is really 300 meters away.
17570,1576323,4,Anuskabelzu,13/09/2021,"Simple but comfortable camping in Vilanova de Gaia. The services are very outdated but clean. Very spacious pitches, not very level. It is very close to the bus stop that takes you to the center of Porto, great for not walking with the van around the city. If you take bikes, forget the bus and go to Porto for a beautiful tour !!! The only downside, minimum two nights, but for the price, it is worth it !!!"
17570,1571859,4,SuNaroundtheworld,12/09/2021,"Also in September there was a minimum stay of two nights, but only 16 euros without electricity. Sanitary facilities are getting old but clean.

17570,1569108,5,Charlymovil,11/09/2021,"Good place to see Porto, a bus 50 meters away that in half an hour leaves you 5 minutes walk from the Luis I bridge, with all services, electricity, water, emptying of gray and black water, they ask for the vaccination certificate to enter, They keep charging you for a minimum of 2 days, a little less than € 19 a day. What has been said to visit Porto is very good and safe."

The punctual bus every half hour with 1.9 euros takes you to the center in 15 minutes, 5 minutes walk from the bridge connecting with Porto. Very slow check-in procedures and they ask you for the green pass. Good accommodation!"

Dirty bathrooms and in bad need of updating. At 11 o'clock the showers close for you and don't open them again until the evening. And € 2 more per person and day of villa rate

A few years ago they set a minimum of 2 nights as a rule but at very low prices. We paid € 17 without electricity for 2 nights 2 people and a motorhome. Now they have doubled it and they charge you the same for every night you spend. It is half that of the Orbitur. Old and broken bathrooms and very neglected"

Better than €25/night just around the corner at Orbitur!"

Electricity is said to be 2 amps but it is not even 2 amps and so fuses are blowed up all times. Sanitary facilities are very aged, remembering 2nd WW military zones. Personel is so rude and have no idea about the city they are living in. The information they gave us about transportation to the city center was wrong."

Me 7.40m and maneuvered to not touch the rear. Otherwise quiet campsite, the person at the reception very nice and speaks good French. On the other hand the price is high, 29 € 60 per night (surely the proximity of the beach where you can not bathe too many rocks and dangerous). The toilets are good to renovate but functional and ""almost clean"". Very good service areas. Well one night."

Otherwise they only take 2 people. August 2020.

17570,852490,4,Benni201,06/07/2020,"Price / performance are okay. 16.30 € for 2 people and camper including electricity fit the location. The place is well suited for a visit to the city of Porto. As already described, the bus stop is right at the entrance to the CP. the bus runs every half hour. Buy an Andante 24 card from the bus driver (you can use all buses and the metro. Costs € 7) otherwise the space doesn't offer much, the sanitary facilities are very dated but always clean. The plots are big enough. With electricity, the places are divided into 2 amps and 10 amps. The 2A are closer to the sanitary facilities than the 10A. But didn't bother us. Yes you have to min. Stay 2 nights, it is funny, but that didn't bother us either because we spent the day of arrival on the beach (approx. 200m). Nice promenade with good cafes and restaurants."

And what is a plus for us, the ESS receptionists speak French."

- Dogs must me muzzled! Very unfriendly and not welcoming for dog-owners. We turned in the gates. 
About pets in general travelling with a dog is really impossible in Portugal. There are stray dogs and guard dogs barking and aggressive behaviour everywhere, and they are always aggressive to your pet when you are out walking."

Bus stop towards Porto 100m. The timetable for the bus is given by the staff. The plots are generously dimensioned and separated with curbs. To get to it you have to drive over these 8cm high edges. Not ideal for the tires. Well, you can remedy this with ramps. Not necessarily suitable for vehicles over 7m in length. There are 2 different power fuses, 2 + 10 amps, but you will be asked how much is needed. Otherwise you just have to know how to help. WIFI not available. It's also OK without that.

To read all the comments on the insecurity of the various parking lots in Porto, do not hesitate to go to this campsite for 2 nights minimum for € 22.44 electricity included. bus 100m to downtown Porto, € 1.90 per person. The reception of the campsite provides the bus timetables, the visit plan and the explanations in French. Really cool"
17570,750753,4,bm.aroundtheworld2,07/12/2019,"Very good camping quality price. Sanitary decrepit but clean, it is important! We spent 2 nights very quiet. Super convenient to visit Porto, which is a 40minutes bus with line 15 just outside the campsite. Welcoming staff. We paid 17 € for 2 nights, no electricity! Complicated to find a better deal!"
17570,743225,4,redalphababe,14/11/2019,"Great value campsite, you have to stay 2 nights min though.  Very helpful friendly staff.  Facilites clean.  Bus just outside for Porto and great position for walks around the beach and then around to the river bank.  Grass pitches were a little problematic only because there had been an unusual amount of rain so park motorhome with care. There are bars and restaurants along the beach and there is a supermarket a few minutes walk away."
17570,739716,3,fuz07,07/11/2019,Clean and secure vintage camping at a more than reasonable price of 22.40 euros for 2 nights with water and electricity. Friendly staff speaking english and a little french. Casa Helena Resto delicious and charming staff. Ideal for 1 visit of Porto thanks to the bus 15 serving the center.
17570,734722,2,marinajohanjena,31/10/2019,"Two stars because not expensive but not worth more than its price. 13 euros per night with electricity. A cold welcome and not goodbye, no laundry, beware if you have a dog or a baby requires an ID card. A yes even if you have a small dog, you will need a muzzle in the campsite. For the water supply, the tap is large, I did not have the mouthpiece"
17570,726911,4,serge77,21/10/2019,"Yes it is rustic in October, few people, about 10 euros for 2 camper. The bus is very close to Porto and even stop on the way back. 1.9 euros the trip"

17570,720894,4,laras,13/10/2019,Good camping to visit porto. we paid 25.08€ for 3 nights. unlimited hot water to shower. old showers but they work. 1.90€ by bus and 10€ by UBER to porto city. yes porto has a airport and yes the campsite is near the sea so you hear waves and planes. i dont understand the comments who hate about the noises. felt save night and day.
17570,720051,2,biene77,13/10/2019,"Somewhat older is unfortunately understated for these sanitary facilities. But the water of the showers is hot, it is cleaned regularly and at the low price in the low season you can not say anything. The bus connection is ok-better than to drive with the camper through the narrow streets of Porto."
17570,719936,5,Mdd001,12/10/2019,"Great to visit Porto with peace of mind. Bus stop at the door, both on the way out and on the way back (ignore applications that indicate otherwise). Camping with the necessary facilities, in operation and clean. Excellent value for money: at the beginning of October, 3 nights, 2 people and motorhome has cost 26.67 euros."
17570,717782,4,Relax2000,10/10/2019,"Small older campsite, especially sanitary facilities and toilet, but everything was clean. Friendly staff. Price performance ratio fits. Good to visit Porto by bus."
17570,715576,3,sophiep07,07/10/2019,"Good camping for a stage in Porto, bus to the city 100m, sanitary and showers very old but clean. Beach, shops and restaurants nearby. Attention if we like you have a small van without electrical outlet, they do not accept that you deploy an extension to your van, they want a catch directly on the vehicle."
17570,714435,3,denimar,06/10/2019,"A good place to stay, looks outdated and untidy but facilities are cared for and very clean. Very helpful staff. After October 1st price is 11.22 per night including tax. Great for visiting Porto by bus or bike. No washing machines. Would stay again."
17570,709801,2,amantares,01/10/2019,"I will try to explain my score. The site is fine, but I do not understand how for 220 seats you only have a single point of emptying gray and cassette so the queues can be desperate. Also force you to stay two nights? The services are large and clean but the toilet cups do not have lids so you have to sit on the porcelain that is very uncomfortable on the surface of the seat. Anyway, for my part I will not recommend"
17570,707414,3,voyage11,28/09/2019,A bit noisy (road and plane). Sanitary clean but outdated. Good reception in French. 2 nights minimum 37 euros 2 people 1 DC 6.5m electricity 10A (of which 8 € tax of stay !!!). Bus to Porto at 100m 1.90 € per person. Wifi only at the bar. Provide large fitting 30mm for water faucet.
17570,702951,4,Mx12,24/09/2019,"I will try to be objective, yes it is a little outdated but everything works unlike other much more expensive, they speak French, are helpful and kind, minimum 2 nights for 24 euros to 2, by cons, the small restaurant next door casa helena which does not look mine is just delicious with its Portuguese specialties for 8 euros only the price of the menu."
17570,698625,1,jackelberri,21/09/2019,We have not parked because the minimum stay is 2 nights and they also force the dogs (apart from being tied) to muzzle them.
17570,694186,4,himate,17/09/2019,We felt comfortable and had nothing to complain about. Showers older but clean and spacious. Staff was nice. Bus stop to Porto a few meters away. 2 minutes walk to the beach.
17570,692456,5,KUN71,15/09/2019,Camping highly recommended to know Porto. Old facilities but very clean. Free Wifi and very cheap. To go to the cantro pass the bus next to the campsite. It can also be reached along the coast by bike. Half an hour of pedaling all flat with beautiful views. Much is bike lane.
17570,692164,4,DoroHS,15/09/2019,"Camping Municipal, cheap, places are assigned, mostly flat and large plots, on request with electricity, very nice dedicated staff, old and clean toilets, for us it was optimal for 3 days Porto, bus stop to Porto about 100m from the campsite, am Take away delicious grilled chicken! Attention: on the narrow path to the beach (about 300m) there is a neighbor who occasionally rushes his dogs on pedestrians! Walk (at least in the dark) avoid! We felt comfortable here and will gladly come again!"
17570,688115,5,DenBart,12/09/2019,"Friendly staff, good location and great price. I was here for a few days and found the staff to be very nice and easy going.

Dog muzzle required but not the end of the world!"
17570,687792,1,oreni,12/09/2019,They asked us to put muzzle on our dog’s mouth!!!! What is this request? We will not come back here again!
17570,687484,1,oreni,12/09/2019,"I have been traveling in my caravan for 4 months now - this is my first bad review here! The experience with this place was terrible. First of all, they asked us to put mouth barrier to my dog (even tough he is completely not dangerous) This is such a rude thing to ask! I will not put it on him when he is in his home ! Moreover, the people at the reception was very unpleasant, it was mandatory to ask minimum two nights, the sanitary was very old and a bit dirty, and basically you can say this is an elderly campsite since there are many that live there. I will not recommend this place. And will definitely not come back again."
17570,684834,1,base0404,10/09/2019,Arrived 5 minutes after closing. Staff was unfriendly and refused to check us in. A bit more forthcoming would have been nice. We ended up going to the next.campsite down the road.
17570,683883,1,SonPol,09/09/2019,"I do not understand the positive comments here. It is the worst place I have stayed so far. The enrollment lasts forever. The person responsible for the allocation of the place can not be surpassed in rudeness. 2 amp fuse that permanently flies out. Sanitary facilities under all s .. Toilet paper or washing machines no indication. On top of all this, you have to stay at least 2 nights (or pay) and so no one has to leave before the barrier closes quickly after the entrance. So avoid it !!!"
17570,682978,4,epolauke,09/09/2019,"Very friendly and helpful staff. Located 500m from the sea, where we saw a beautiful sunset. There is a supermarket nearby. The Uber takes about 20 minutes (8 €) to the center of Porto. The sanitary facilities are old, but very clean. Have three third € 22 / night paid, so really cheap. Clientele rather 50+, but we still felt very comfortable."
17570,676601,5,JadaRoadies,04/09/2019,"Great place to stand safely in Porto. The place is very simple, but is enough to stay overnight. Showers and toilets old, but it gets cleaned every day. The beach is 2 minutes walk. By bike you can drive super on the coastal path to Porto, about 30 minutes. Wifi at the bar for free. Minimum stay two nights, with electricity about 34 €."
17570,674247,1,chantals,03/09/2019,"Speak French at the reception however it is mandatory to spend two days minimum and muzzle dogs of any size or breed even a dwarf poodle. It is inconceivable that my dogs live in these conditions. The campsite should eventually refuse the dogs it would be simpler and more honest rather than ask their master to muzzle, inadmissible"
17570,673104,4,magellan643,02/09/2019,"Good reception, sufficient location about 50 m2, near the beach and Porto by bus or faster by Uber or taxi. Sanitary a little aging. Price for a van, 2 people and electricity, taxes 17 €. Attention minimum 2 nights."
17570,669892,4,melissastr,31/08/2019,"Camping directly on the beach and great connection to Porto! Sanitary facilities outdated, toilets without glasses and rarely toilet paper. For 2 nights it was still great and with the beach anyway unbeatable price."
17570,669850,2,jacky451,31/08/2019,Modification of the comment left in 2014 following the photo of the campsite has deteriorated no improvement has been made we feel that it is a little abandoned at the service level a motorhome of 7 m is practically unfeasible against the price it has evolved well almost 20 € with electricity for 24 hours very expensive for the service that is offered it is really very difficult to drive in small alleys with a CampingCard of more than 7 m
17570,661475,1,Sarahluna,26/08/2019,"Refoulés at the entrance! Our typical Labrador bitch did not have a muzzle. They offered to lend us one but they were not the right size, so we had to look for another place to sleep. In this campsite, ALL DOGS WHATEVER THEIR JIG MUST BE MUSELED. Not cool if you too think that your 4-legged companion deserves to share your vacation."
17570,655611,2,mag79,24/08/2019,"French speaking reception staff, 300m bus line ideal for visiting porto but camping without interest (electricity did not support a hair dryer) and sanitary more than outdated, price level: very expensive (47 euros for 2 nights to 3 with a motorhome) and we are asked to stay 2 nights minimum."
17570,654556,4,karramarro,23/08/2019,"Simple camping, very clean and very practical to visit Porto. Bus (line 15) at the entrance to the campsite and the return leaves us on the beach 5 minutes from the campsite. The bus goes through the campsite again but is standing for 15 minutes on the beach."

The toilets are certainly old but clean. The nickel crockery. The welcome is cold but if we had to start again we would do it because once the paperwork is done, we're fine. Quiet campsite, well materialized pitches, paved driveways. Bar in the campsite. No laundry (only washing to avoid). And the beach (which we will do tomorrow morning) at the end of the street .. We recommend."
17570,644639,4,nicnac311,19/08/2019,"Small campsite with mostly friendly staff, a bit obscure check-in rites -> you will be sent away at noon, because the place is ""full"" (although obviously several places are free) and should come back 2 hours later then one of the already free seats to get!? A lot of Underwood completely neglected Dauercamper / Bruchbuden but overall still charming. The sanitary facilities are old but most clean only with a height of over 1.80 you look beyond the walls ... you have to stay at least 2 nights or pay! The bus ride to Porto (especially the return trip) is an absolute experience !! Saturday was a party with suckling pig and live music. On and around the kiosk there is free and above all really fast Wifi !!"

17570,484600,2,weyhercamper,15/05/2019,"Well, the place is quite good to visit Porto. The reception was very nice and you are also helpful with questions. Bus stop around the corner. But washrooms more than aged. The disposal is not easy to drive. The high curbs to the places are already tire killer. Current 2 or 10 amps."
17570,484265,2,plume83400,14/05/2019,"No top but convenient to visit Porto, the 2 people very nice restaurant"
17570,483107,2,air7,13/05/2019,"Very little value for money! The site is mostly for (Portuguese) permanent campers. Electricity is mainly only 2A (basic charging, no cooking...) for EUR 2.20. There is no degressive price option The sanitaire installation are in desperate condition and from the 70ties, with boiling hot showers, but clean. Porto is beautiful - but this (municipal...) site is a shame for the city."
17570,477902,4,Birdland,06/05/2019,"It's true camping a bit older but hot showers, and handy for visiting Porto with the bus. There are also hotels not too far 60 € minimum!"

Total and without electricity and without dog. 16.19 € per day. A little, a lot expensive. On the sites the sidewalk borders are high..We are surrounded by tents / caravans and mobile homes in tents .."
17570,472019,4,alinaribena,30/04/2019,"A bit scruffy around the edges with some dilapidated caravans, but we liked it here. Fellow campers were friendly and our pitch was a nice size, good bus links to visit Porto. One man on reception was mega grumpy but the others were friendly. On site takeaway restaurant. Gate locked at night, so it felt secure. I'm surprised that others are complaining so much"
17570,467282,3,ger3553,25/04/2019,"OK but nothing more. many caravans in poor condition with torn canopy. Large car camping pitches. Near the sea. Price of 11 euros / night, minimum 2 nights. electricity."
17570,466909,2,dieBonner,25/04/2019,The whole place with all facilities is very much in need of renovation. The laundry is 2 km away at Lidl and not on the square. You have to book and pay for at least 3 nights.
17570,465793,3,miriana,23/04/2019,"I confirm camping with honest fare, good reception, easy to reach Porto with bus number 15 in about half an hour with itinerary in the narrow and winding streets of the suburbs, old but working hot showers."

17570,448884,1,jean-louis,04/04/2019,"We wanted to stay one night and had to pay two. We were not warned, we had to read the regulation, abnormal. Home mediocre, sanitary to remake, we will quickly forget it."
17570,448879,1,fuseta,04/04/2019,"Skip your way.Two mandatory nights otherwise a night for the price of two. Sanitary stale. Difficult traffic in the campsite, wait three quarters of an hour for a place or to leave. To avoid."

17570,446640,1,Blabliblubb,30/03/2019,"When checking in we asked if we needed to pay for two nights, even if we stayed just a single one. The receptionist said we should pay the price for one night in the morning, but when we wanted to check out she tried to charge us for two nights. We ended up paying for one (8,36€) after 15 minutes of arguing. Facilities were clean but old, so the price for one night (two people/van/no electricity) seemed reasonable."

The campsite certainly does not look, but the place is quiet, the managers are very friendly and the showers are certainly outdated but so hot, instead of staying there, 1 night we have done 4. Off season for 4 night we paid € 28.40 which is more than adequate. Feel free to eat at the restaurant or take the take away next door. It's so good :) See you"
17570,394982,1,baudge,17/10/2018,"We wanted to stay overnight but could not. They did not accept our electrical connection inside the van (without external outlet), saying for security reasons. Minimum of 2 nights but low rate: 10 euros for 2 with van and electricity."

Bit scruffy around the edges but facilities were very clean and staff were very friendly. Local beach was just 2 minute walk away, easy cycle into Porto and bus stop just around the corner, bus was €1.90 each way. Everything we needed for our 3 night stay."
17570,376197,5,Barouville,17/09/2018,"When I see the comments, I am outraged ... There is in this campsite, a little old, an area at the bottom to empty the gray water and in the sanitary next door, a point to empty the chemical cassettes. Frankly this kind of comments from another world, has no place here. Just ask the managers of the campsite or search a little, everything is indicated."

17570,372911,4,gig34i,13/09/2018,Rustic and cheap camping. Friendly welcome with explanations for the Porto bus. It is true that the toilets date from the 50s and that it is poorly maintained although clean. Info the gray water and clean water fillings are done on a paved area in red at the bottom of the campsite south side near the multisport stadium.

The campsite is small and its facilities are outdated, the staff is charming and speaks French, the bathrooms are very clean at any time of the day ... and there is wifi at the bar! The beach - beautiful with bars and restaurants - is 3 minutes walk, perfect too! It is however required to sleep 2 nights minimum, but for 21.62 with electricity the 2 nights for 2 adults in camper (in this 09.09.2018), it is an excellent quality / price ratio; very popular campsite, almost full at this time too; I highly recommend!"
17570,368821,3,malou29200,09/09/2018,Most: the price and the proximity of porto (bike path or bus) beach 5 minutes walk home in French well the least sanitary unworthy of a campsite
17570,368378,4,ClemoO,08/09/2018,The minimum duration is two nights
17570,368375,4,ClemoO,08/09/2018,"Be careful when you arrive 2-3 km from the campsite, do not follow your GPS (Waze or other) because it takes you in small streets accessible only by car, follow the signs ""campismo""."
17570,368374,4,ClemoO,08/09/2018,"Ideal for enjoying the beach and especially visiting Porto, the bus is ideal for getting around, pitches and old sanitary facilities but does the trick especially for the price of camping about 20 euros for two nights, ready to take PT / FR. Driveways quite narrow but it goes!"
17570,366855,4,Kvist,07/09/2018,Really friendly staff and very welcoming. You can hear the sea ? Reasonable price and easy bus connection to Porto centre. Highly recommend this camp site over the much more expensive one from orbitur.

We will repeat!"
17570,357473,4,arkalira,28/08/2018,"We spent 2 nights. Very economical: 21.60 euros 2 people with ac and light. There are no shadows and the truth is that the sun punishes a lot. the services, although they work correctly, look somewhat outdated. Even so it compensates the price and the correct attention of the workers."

Friendly managers and speaking French. Bus to Porto 2 minutes from the campsite. it takes 35-40 minutes of bus to 1.90 € per person per trip always better than driving in Porto with his camper. In summary I recommend it for a visit to Porto.

17570,308865,2,advanturelovers.de,31/07/2018,"The low price is reflected in the sanitary facilities again. With the many tents of permanent campers you have refugee camp atmosphere.

17570,264016,3,4x4onroad,05/06/2018,"Good city campground with very simple equipment. Approximately 11 euros per night, but we had to min. book two nights. The bus for 1.85 euros to Porto leaves virtually directly before the exit and takes about 35 minutes to the final destination in Porto. The beach of Canedilo is worth a visit. Especially at low tide you have access to / under the excavated stones."

We could not do night for this reason. We tried to buy one around (veterinarians, pet stores, lidl, etc.) and we found nothing. In Jumbo they had a muzzle, but only for a small breed."

We stayed 4 nights, the garbage is in the middle of the campsite when the hot water is absent. This gentleman goes into the campsite and does not know you anymore. The icing on the cake is the best, we remained bogged down half wheel despite all the precautions we had taken. I go to the reception this gentleman was absent. She is a lady who was very annoyed. I asked to see the boss who was not reachable. It was 9 o'clock, we were told it was arriving at 1pm, we were waiting 4am and never saw this gentleman.

Attention to the big motorhome; Drain at the bottom of the campsite with very narrow paths. Payment: no CB, cash with no extra money to make you. To finish well you wipe the feet at the risk of making you maliciously resume by the ugly duckling."

Better atmosphere, cleaner sanitary, small supermarket to troubleshoot. otherwise supermarket very close even on foot. Bus to Porto closer to the campsite faster and cheaper. Certainly obliged to take 2 nights but motorhome 3,18 € / day, person 2,65 € / day, electricity if taken outside :-( 2,33 € / day for my part 2 times cheaper for 2 more times I will pray to the sun god and solar panels for electricity."

Positive: close to the beach, the bus stop (with the number 15 you go to Porto, the return bus is until 12), close to the bike path for running or cycling, very cheap price, quiet, level plots. Negative: bathrooms. Dirty. There is no hot water (or at least, of the three times, I didn't get it any of the time, nor did I get it in the remaining five showers). Yes, the staff is very friendly."

On the other hand, the welcome is very different depending on the person and the big downside is that the regulars are very noisy!

17570,80538,5,vicou,09/07/2016,"Very friendly, great welcome, simple campsite but you can find what you need there. Bus to Porto nearby and quiet at night despite the fact that we were there for the football semi-final where Portugal won!"
17570,72487,4,beatricebl,10/05/2016,"Very nice home. Good location. The bus is at the end of the street, convenient for visiting Porto. Too bad for us we had three rains with sunshine from time to time."
17570,65017,2,marie-claire,08/03/2016,"During the winter, let's say, I went there to do laundry. Unlike the presentation logo: No washing machine, no place to hang out the laundry. For electricity, take the biggest amperage because a single hair dryer makes everything break. Otherwise a friendly welcome, in French and in song from the usher."
17570,63011,3,roadmender,28/01/2016,"Campground near Porto located in a quiet area close to the ocean. Nothing to complain about the cleanliness of the sanitary facilities. On the other hand, we came with our small dogs: it is forbidden to leave them free even on our pitch with intensive policing. Slushy terrain so be careful when it rains the water evaporates poorly. Cats fighting at night and dogs barking in a nearby enclosure (not ours). Reception not very friendly but affordable prices approximately 2.5 for the location and 1.08 per person electricity in addition approximately 2.3"
17570,60678,5,roots56,05/12/2015,"Great, very quiet, very warm welcome while singing!) and above all we paid €4.77 for one night, 2 people and 1 campervan, free for dogs (vaccination certificate requested). 30 minutes by bus to go to the center of Porto at €1.80 per ticket.

17570,46209,4,christ141,04/08/2015,"Very nice campsite, recommended. And not expensive... Very close to the beach, bike path, bars, gray water drains, a little outdated but that's okay. Too bad no wifi. Bus a few meters away for Porto n°15, 30 minutes to get there. Worth seeing, extraordinary city. Combining Vila Nova de Gaia and Porto is great!"

Very friendly welcome with map of Porto and all possible details for a good visit to the city. The bus is 200 m from the campsite entrance and drops off in the town center. €1.80 per person per trip. The campsite is quiet, the toilets are perfect, the staff are smiling and very available. There is only one thing missing: a washing machine, an additional paid service of course."

17599,2731705,5,pafranck,07/05/2023,Superb place. A lot of room for motorhomes / vans. Many locals who come and go during the day but very pleasant. Watch out for the wind!

17599,2661077,4,andreas4bln,11/04/2023,"Nice and safe place above the beach with no service - fantastic sunsets included. Toilets were still closed, but small town with gastronomy - 2km walk on the beach to the right - accessible."

17599,2644870,5,suusaa,06/04/2023,"Really a great place. Also busy during the day during the week but if they put you vans well there is space. If necessary, further ahead on the road."
17599,2609185,5,theauroravan,14/03/2023,The spot is smaller than it used to be because part of the cliff broke off. So only 1/3 of the spots are left. Quiet. There are big holes on the way and also on the parking space. The ones on the parking space are filled with water after the rain. So be careful where you park.
17599,2592980,5,Kurt-Suender,27/02/2023,"Great place. Straight pitches, lots of beach and space. Very crowded on weekends. You should position yourself so that you don't take up 3-4 seats! After all, you are a guest here!"
17599,2525592,5,Santiago2022,21/12/2022,Nice parking between pine forest and ocean.
17599,2496383,2,Cneel,15/11/2022,"Nice place. In the afternoon fun with surfers present. Facilities closed. In the evening and night, despite extreme rain, a lot of traffic driving back and forth. Often the same ones, apparently looking. Our feeling was that there was a deal . Unpleasant for us. Left immediately the next day. Bit of a shame about the place. Wouldn't go back."
17599,2492313,5,mathelsmit,12/11/2022,"Nice place! There was a lot of water from the rain the past few days. The view is breathtaking. The facilities are closed. Quiet place, at night some traffic on and off. Lots of surfers and fishermen. Place recommended for 2-3 nights. Poltie thought it was no problem and came to enjoy the view. Definitely recommended!"
17599,2476091,4,Patrick1401,01/11/2022,"We stood here for one night. Overall very quiet, but cars come by every now and then at night and you wake up from them. But they are anglers who want to catch fish. Perfect for 1-2 nights!"
17599,2439188,5,FrancesV,12/10/2022,Lovely spot. Frequented by quite a few surfers. Quiet lovely sunset but mist back in the morning
17599,2420570,5,Gromo,03/10/2022,"NOT for vehicles over 3.5 t. At the beginning of the path to the square there is a sign banning heavy vehicles from entering. Have just been very kindly pointed out by the Gardia Civil that we are not allowed to be here, but camping is not a problem. Great place right behind the dunes and an incredibly great beach."
17599,2415280,5,karenwe,01/10/2022,"Stood here one night - worked out great. Unfortunately the bar was closed, possibly because the weather wasn't so good. But you can stand beautifully in the middle of the pine trees right by the sea"
17599,2414635,3,Joss44,30/09/2022,We stayed 2 nights parking 200m from the beach along the road. No services but it's quiet.

Beautiful long sandy beach. Wonderful beach shower. The GNR came by and checked the right one. Please take rubbish with you or throw it in the bucket. :-)"

17599,2338620,3,JanEdinger,04/09/2022,"Great place right by the sea, where you can stay for several days without any problems. All kinds of authorities pass by here (GNR and even the military), but nobody says anything. Unfortunately, however, far too much traffic and therefore noise for my taste, during the day and at night due to quite a few ""cruisers"" who drive across the entire parking lot and look for a quick number."
17599,2319298,5,surroundedbydetails,29/08/2022,Very nice spot for a night or two with some surf. Space for both big and small vehicals available and even though with a fair amount of neighbours around it’s a very nice vibe! There are a few more spots close by which is recommended to look at if you want to be a bit more alone.
17599,2313562,5,matildaurlaub,28/08/2022,"Relatively nice place, almost directly on the water, unfortunately quite full. On Sunday the locals arrived with tables, food and music and set up camp for the day in the forest. There are nicer places, but perfectly adequate for surfing and sleeping. And we definitely felt very safe!"
17599,2304277,5,anamei,26/08/2022,"Very good spot next to the beach and the forest. The beach is beautiful, there is a bar with toilets."

17599,2280082,5,MarieBabe,21/08/2022,"Great spot!! We slept to the sound of the waves. We arrived around 7 p.m., found a place easily and were able to enjoy the lounge bar with music and the setting sun. At 9 p.m., everything closes and the place becomes quiet. It is a very popular spot with locals and there was a crowd on the beach the next day at the end of the morning, so be careful, it is more difficult to find a place during the day."
17599,2272686,5,rayman016,20/08/2022,"Great quiet place for van and Cc whether it's day or night, good surf spot. The beach is beautiful."
17599,2245309,5,Isidris,15/08/2022,A great place to park your van. You can see the sea while you sleep. There are also restrooms open until 8:00 p.m. and a beach bar run by a very friendly family. There is also a beach shower. There are quite a few motorhomes and people camping but no noise at night. It is a surfer area with a good atmosphere.
17599,2245068,5,ange85310,15/08/2022,"an exceptional view, the spot is top the bar with the music very good atmosphere we spend the night, there are several camper vans so safe."
17599,2234462,5,pdevila,14/08/2022,"Fantastic place to spend one or two nights, quiet, with a spectacular sunset accompanied by good live music at the beach bar (on Saturday) and where they serve meals. There is a bathroom that is fine, and a very good atmosphere. Highly recommended."
17599,2194948,1,gluecklicht,08/08/2022,"could be a nice and practical place, but unfortunately there was a lot of disrespectful behavior.. it was reserved with camping tables (large) parking spaces and unfortunately it looked like camping for 85% of the campers. PLEASE, less selfishness and more respect!!! The world (and the parking lot) is not ours."
17599,2183632,4,Jacogc,06/08/2022,"Secluded and quiet site right at the entrance to the beach. Quite a lot of vans/ac but we got a seat on the front line (you only see the sea if you open the roof from the top as there is a sand wall right in front of it. There are rubbish bins, outdoor showers, toilets, lifeguards and bar with good service During the day, 2 rather suspicious people hanging around and watching the vans/ac."
17599,2165116,2,Iree,03/08/2022,"Super crowded in summer... Motorhomes totally occupying the best spots near the beach. I am surprised they are not yet banned.
free shower is a big plus.

*** Please use a shovel for your dog's and your own toilet.
And leave no toilet paper pleeease.
Leave the place cleaner than you found it ***"

17599,2028761,5,Aurelie1703,02/07/2022,"Great spot, a lot of wind but in the car park before the beach there is less. Near cycle path, several hiking trails/walks. We spent 2 nights in this wonderful place under the pines"

17599,1941992,4,PaulaPawsome,03/06/2022,"The square is a common place for 'cruising' in the homosexual scene, so the traffic here is quite high. In addition, many simply do their business in the forest - please take your stuff with you and take a bucket or something with you. We spent a very quiet night. Great view, great beach for surfing."

17599,1887736,4,Ragnar666,13/05/2022,"Super nice place. There is plenty of room to park. Unfortunately there are no toilets, that's the negative side of this spot, Garbage in the grass next to the parking lot, it's really a shame that people don't take care of such a place. Little privacy since there were still a lot of people, but the view is incredible and you really feel good there."
17599,1884432,4,Frida23.5.2020,11/05/2022,Great view. Sleep with the sound of the sea. Unfortunately a bit busy even at a late hour.

17599,1846987,3,sanubis,23/04/2022,"Beautiful sea view, rubbish bins available and a pine forest with a picnic area. However, in 15 years I have never seen so much car traffic in a beach parking lot. Up to 100 vehicles per hour, no one stays, just turn around and drive again. More traffic than on some Autobahns. What are they all doing there? Just look and drive again, strange and constant engine noise, too bad"
17599,1843163,4,Amirto,21/04/2022,If you are looking for a wild place but in the company of some campers not too close this is the right place! We parked our van near the beach where we could admire the ocean!

There is no lifeguard service, Surf point. The incredible environment: beach with dunes, bike path, pine forests and picnic areas. We only saw environmental agents controlling the area. Just one night but we will be back."
17599,1818341,5,SophieundMartin,13/04/2022,"Great parking lot with a great view of the sea. Only a few pitches with a direct sea view, but the rest of the parking lot is big enough. We stood here with several campers, but with enough space for privacy. Access was easy. We loved it here!"
17599,1800517,5,bamboobus,29/03/2022,Beautiful view of a wonderful beach. We stood here 2 quiet nights with other campers. The highlights were definitely the sunset and the starry sky.

17599,1739763,5,MelanievdBrink,23/01/2022,"Beautiful place, stayed 2 nights! Direct view of the sea from the parking space. During the weekend it can be quite busy with beachgoers and surfers during the day, but in the evenings it is quiet."
17599,1737248,4,Hardy59,19/01/2022,"Stunning view but not for light sleepers. Surf is very loud. If that bothers you, you should stand further back on the long course. Large mud in front and very restless. Movement in the form of cars arriving and leaving again until late at night."
17599,1720857,5,parknighteb,31/12/2021,"Amazing view, more campervans around you. Just a bit loud in the morning when the joggers visit but overall really nice"
17599,1717755,4,Britt_V,28/12/2021,"It's a nice spot, really close to the beach, with nice paths to walk on. We weren't able to park on the big parking space closest to the beach, beacause it was to wet for our van to go there. We ended up parking on the other spaces along the road that leads there. That's something to keep in mind when visiting after a lot of rainfall."

17599,1654006,4,Regina65,20/10/2021,"So I don't know when the photos are from, half of the parking lot was torn away from the sea. It's a great place as long as it doesn't rain. Is an unpaved sand parking lot, so a muddy place after the rain. Right by the sea and very quiet from 8 p.m."
17599,1556730,3,Charlymovil,07/09/2021,"Good place to spend a couple of days maximum since there is no service for ac. At night super quiet, we were with 5 ac / camper."

only toilet in the beach bar and only beach showers so would need your own facilities for longer than a couple of nights.  we loved it!"

17599,1066949,3,Rafabi,24/09/2020,"Very nice place, sea view but only with a pop-up roof on most of the places, as a small dune was raised. The toilets were never open when we were there (September, 7-10am), as was the bar. Cars drove in and out the whole evening, night and morning, which bothered us a lot as we were at the entrance of the parking lot and to the The sea, because otherwise all seats were already taken."
17599,1053389,5,ruivalente,17/09/2020,Quiet place with other caravans but with space to be far away. Very hospitable beach cafe with bathroom and outside shower. I recommend!

17599,956142,1,vreydap,12/08/2020,"Year after year it gets worse when it comes to the wild nature of the site. this year we were definitely disappointed. They raised a slope so that you can no longer see the sea sitting from your deck chair, and parking spaces have diminished.

On the other hand, we were there on August 14, 2023 so many people more during the day than at night. But no noise to sleep. Lots of places available.....if you like to be with people around!

The beautiful, quiet place, next to the river where we could put our feet, the children had a great time. Dirt road but easy to access. We will be back without a doubt."

17627,1589141,5,Elsa2,18/09/2021,Very nice place right by the stream. Quiet even on weekends at this time of year. You just stand on pebbles.
17627,1582080,3,KellySpit,15/09/2021,"Maybe we didn't have the same luck as everyone that day ... The parking lot was full in the best place, so we were close to the mini ""waterfall"" it was quite bright and very humid. The road is not very far higher. The pitches at the entrance are certainly much more pleasant."

17627,1469351,5,vieuxjames,17/08/2021,"It is the first car park in a series of nooks and crannies where you can land (the natural sites marked nearby). I arrived on the 15th morning a little before 9am, it was very crowded. Almost all the spaces were occupied. Then it is the comings and goings all day long between those who go to visit and those who come to bathe. Before returning for the night. But very pleasant and calm."

17627,1123847,4,benoitv,25/12/2020,"Be careful, the GPS point is not exactly the right one. First small path after the bridge. Do not hesitate to continue along the dirt road, it is drivable and there are several car parks which allow you to turn around if necessary. The spots farther from the start of the path are cleaner."

17627,1014275,4,PauLaUR,30/08/2020,"Very nice place. There are enough vans. The river runs through there, perfect for taking a dip. When we arrived there was a couple of AC and it was all very quiet. At night 4 more vans and two cars arrived. They all went together, they set up 3 tents ... We spent the night and in the morning we left soon, although it is very good to spend the day there."
17627,988049,5,DianeD,21/08/2020,"Very quiet spot, only a van (on the 1st spot with the small beach) when we arrived. Several locations, quite isolated from each other along the road. Later, 2 local vans passed by to land at the end of the path. Flat pitches."
17627,884501,4,bobdyVan,20/07/2020,"Spot near Alquezar, very nice, shaded and easy to access in traffic. If available, the first spot on the edge of the torrent is very cool, a little patch of sand. No noise far enough from the road. The water is very clear and clean! I recommend"
17627,794573,4,ste2fi,12/03/2020,Nice spot if you have animals because the road is far. Clean spot! I just stopped there to eat and I crossed paths with someone on foot.
17627,636801,4,victart,17/08/2019,"Following the path, beyond the limit of the last place to park you can enjoy an entrance to the river. Thanks to the architectural work of girls and boys you will find a pool where you can look for clay stones to give you a layer of mud and feel even younger."
17627,627659,3,kami-kaze,14/08/2019,Very busy place in the middle of August. and especially very noisy because close to the road. we were there at the San Lorenzo festivities and very noisy until late at night. accessible rather for little van
17627,615302,5,horitzons,10/08/2019,"Very good place, we slept on the river tonight, we were worried about some comment, but seeing that we were many sleeping there was something else. Great wake up with bathroom included!"

17627,602751,3,SaioataKai,06/08/2019,"Although the road is close it is a very quiet place. The river is very good for bathing. Pass the GC and fine all those who spend the night, saying that there are two campsites and we are obliged to use them because it is forbidden to spend the night outside them."

17627,499287,5,mbb0,01/06/2019,A very nice and quiet place. Easy access although from Google Maps the location is not exact. Take the junction of Buera and after the bridge the first dirt path. It's very close

17627,94170,3,gpukqrir,13/08/2016,"The setting is nice with the proximity of the river to cool off, even if the road is just across the river. Very dusty sand and be careful not to get stuck in the pebbles (that's what happened to us despite propulsion with twin wheels)"

17627,47744,4,Mcmojo64,10/08/2015,Excellent quiet place. Do not hesitate to advance 200 m further on the small path (pass through a bamboo path). A spot on the left on a grass / sand area with a magnificent view of Alquezar on the left is waiting for you.
17628,585201,1,elevacionbendicion,30/07/2019,"They have fined us. Idyllic place, spectacular views, one step away from the bank of the swamp. But ... At 8:00 AM the environmental guards passed and sanctioned us for overnight."
17628,474668,1,Luis7,03/05/2019,"The site is fine but there is a sign that prohibits the passage except authorized vehicles. We left just in case. There are many other places in the area with signs that prohibit camping (for them to park is camping), or directly do not allow overnight in a motor home. Even in some tiny town they do not let you park. It is clear that in Soria they do not want us."
17628,348821,5,cut,22/08/2018,"At the lake, right next to the yacht club. Do not hesitate to continue on the dirt road, there are dozens of spots available! Shadow, sun, and calm at the rendezvous. Beware of (many) mosquitoes in summer!"

Very quiet, pure nature, there are trees at the edge of the road but no problem with the motorhome. Influx of wild animals that will drink. Respect the space without litter and dog waste. Ideal to disconnect."
17628,238127,4,garysajames,18/04/2018,Arrived here 18th April.  Very nice spot but at the moment most of it is too soft for a van. I thought I had chosen a firm spot but sank up to the axles - in a small VW camper. Needed a tow out. So  check it out but be very careful of the ground conditions.
17628,236935,4,Alberto99,15/04/2018,"Entry a bit complicated due to the condition of the track. Otherwise quiet place to relax and with excellent views of the reservoir, there is no restriction to enter and park. There is no service"

17628,104207,4,quiquemonroy,10/09/2016,We went in September. A very nice and quiet place. It falls asleep phenomenally. There are no bathrooms. You have to follow the path that goes to the pier and go to the left a little before arriving. It is easy to see.
17633,3290424,5,frasum,12/09/2023,"The view and connection with line 58 are only surpassed by the super nice ladies at reception. People have found THEIR jobs here! Thank you very much for the explanation, nice welcome, uncomplicated instructions and a totally friendly farewell, which makes you forget the Swedish yapping Tölen at night and the street noises from 5 a.m. onwards. We recommend!"
17633,3289950,4,natandgil,12/09/2023,It’s true that the women at the reception deserve six stars!!! Monday at 10 a.m. we took the last place (without reservation) I can't imagine in high season! ) but you have to be patient and wait your turn otherwise!

17633,3250569,1,thirs89,02/09/2023,"No place to stay overnight at the beginning of September. The staff were very unclear and unhelpful to questions from the people queuing to be served. According to the employees, the parking lot next to the site could not be used for a day visit (max 2 meters height and daily police checks). As a result, only had a day visit to Bilbao and parked elsewhere."
17633,3249318,4,jarcelus,02/09/2023,"It fills up soon. If you do not have a reservation, arrive before 11 am. The check-in process is very slow, but those who attend are very friendly. There are few bathrooms and they require you to ask for a key. A 5-minute walk away you can take the bus, it doesn't run that often and it takes 20 minutes to get to the downtown area. It is not accessible by pedestrians because it is on the hill. Maximum 48 hours, counted from arrival."

17633,3224025,5,CarlosAveiro,27/08/2023,"excellent stay, with all services available and working well. the frequent connection (30 in 30 m) by bus (58) to the city is an added value that allows great freedom of action"
17633,3215449,4,oiac85,25/08/2023,Corresponds exactly to the description. We were lucky enough to be here at the Bilbao fiesta and the buses were there 24 hours a day... as well as fireworks!!
17633,3208143,5,familyperez18,23/08/2023,"Good views, quiet environment, great views of Bilbao. We liked it a lot."
17633,3202103,5,rpk128,22/08/2023,"Nice and helpful reception, if you stand in the first row you have a wonderful super view over Bilbao. Safe and well-kept complex. Bus to the city runs every 30 minutes (1.35€), unfortunately only until about 10pm. Uber to the city costs 20-30€. Pitch without electricity, 2 people, 17€"
17633,3201951,4,SimonHelleux,22/08/2023,Area very well located thanks to the bus that takes you to the city center. Correct pitch with individual water and electricity. Too bad you can only stay there for 48 hours. I recommend.
17633,3199320,5,nea0815,22/08/2023,a great place to see the city. came spontaneously and got a place. Bus stop 2 minutes walk into town
17633,3198119,4,JABUINPA,22/08/2023,"Large plots, impressive views of the city and a bus stop next door that runs every half hour, although it takes another half hour to reach the historic center. The girls at the reception are very kind, friendly and decisive. The only thing but they don't have showers, just a bathroom. At 200 meters there is a brewery with a huge terrace and a variety of dishes both to eat there and to take away."
17633,3198006,5,BelgianAussie,22/08/2023,"Good location , feels safe to leave vehicle. Bus 58 provided easy access in and out of city. Reservations not taken until September so we were advised to arrive between 10-12 to see what’s available. Every day, due to 48 hour max stay, lots leave so getting a place was easy. It looked full on the weekend but Monday night there were spaces left."
17633,3196990,5,frado78,22/08/2023,"Clean and quiet rest area on a hill above Bilbao. Toilets, no showers. Current and water loading and unloading. Bus stop just outside the campsite. We returned by taxi: from the Guggenheim to the rest area 10 euros. Very kind staff"
17633,3192724,4,PulpoDuck14,21/08/2023,"Very cool area! Impressive views, water and electricity on each plot, bathrooms without showers, a small market. Change of waters. Maximum 48h. I am not giving it 5 stars due to the lack of a shower (which is available for €6) and the 48-hour restriction."
17633,3191842,5,Stella74,21/08/2023,"25 € for 4 people without electricity (available, but not necessary for us). Perfect view and accessibility of the city, on foot or by bus. The only downside is that there are only 3 toilets and they cannot be locked. For the rest ladies very friendly and bread to order. We got there around 10:30 and were lucky they had room. We were lucky with the celebrations with beautiful fireworks."
17633,3180870,4,marilenatanci,19/08/2023,"Camper area for parking max 48h. There is electricity plus loading and unloading. Toilets but no shower. I recommend arriving early, even if there is a lot of camper turnover because you cannot park for more than 48 hours."
17633,3172298,1,bepprossi,18/08/2023,"if you are looking for an area to load / unload water, do not go here, they only provide this service for overnight stays! really regrettable...."
17633,3171864,4,KerstinBusch,18/08/2023,"Good place, very friendly service, toilets and a very good disposal station. The driveway is a bit steep. The city is very easy to get to, perfect for a visit. A shower would be nice, but unfortunately there isn't one."
17633,3171849,5,dennythecow,18/08/2023,"Super place, outstanding view. Nice staff. 25 minutes from the center by bus."
17633,3168975,5,CG1980,17/08/2023,"We spent two relaxing nights here and reserved in advance by email. Very quiet at night. A few meters below there is a bus stop from which you can reach the center every 30 minutes (journey time 30 minutes). Very nice view of Bilbao! For me the best place to stay in Bilbao! Toilets available, UNFORTUNATELY no showers!"
17633,3163601,5,RobertaBO,16/08/2023,"Great place, quiet and well done! Very full so spent first night in car park opposite with no problems. Book or arrive early in the morning."
17633,3163597,3,piervi,16/08/2023,"Unfortunately we found it busy. We had to give up because as soon as we parked in the city to go for a ride, we immediately saw two guys circling our camper. We were lucky to see them and stupid them not to wait. We went back up and goodbye Bilbao."
17633,3162119,5,jtw77,16/08/2023,"Super friendly reception (thanks to the blonde lady with the blue eyes), despite a lot of stress. When we asked for a reservation by e-mail, we were told to try our luck between 10 and 12. It worked! The Hostal Bilbao is a 15 minute walk and you can take a shower there. Only 1 toilet at the site, but water at every site. We are looking forward to the next time!"
17633,3151571,5,itsavansworld,15/08/2023,"Great place. Friendly welcome. Bus stop to the center every half hour nearby. TIP: buy a Barik pass in the center. Can be found at metro stops. That card (can be used for several people!) costs 3 euros once and you top it up per euro. For example, each bus ride to the center will be 0.33 euros instead of 1.35 euros and the cable car will be 0.60 instead of 4.50. You get your money out quickly!!"
17633,3150156,5,romano06,15/08/2023,"excellent parking, large place with water and electricity at each location. 17€ per night 4€ electricity. top drains. Max 2 nights. it is written full but you have to come early in the morning and wait for others to come out. excellent welcome, all services. bus down on the bend which takes you to the centre. Autonomía stop to go to the museum."
17633,3149390,4,VeroBroBl,15/08/2023,"There are few places for a city like Bilbao so it is advisable to book by email, even if there is a lot of coming and going in the morning. You can easily get to the center by bus. The pitches are very large, they would have more places for other campers, a chemical toilet and water loading/unloading, electricity, one bathroom only available for those who want to try their luck, no showers. €21 per night with two adults"
17633,3141244,1,LudoKarine69,14/08/2023,"no reservation possible, arrived at 9 p.m. - Park full, prices are quite high and not much shade... the car park opposite is fine... but... there is a generator: a dull and permanent noise and smells like a refinery!"
17633,3137456,5,OmerEisenstadt,13/08/2023,"This was our first parking with our motorhome after landing in Madrid and driving to Bilbao. A wonderful place to start the journey. Very recommended! Amazing views, clean and friendly staff!"
17633,3137102,5,vax69,13/08/2023,"Excellent rest area. They no longer accept reservations until September but if you have a little patience you can enter, there is a lot of turnover thanks to the fact that the stop is for a maximum of 48h."
17633,3135724,5,Jag6o6,13/08/2023,"Learn not to be difficult. Spacious pitches. Water and electricity on each pitch (optional). Clean toilets! A shower option is chargeable (and expensive, 6€, we did without). Otherwise the view is great. The bus passes next to the parking area. A guard is present. It's secure at night."
17633,3135550,1,Novatosx6,13/08/2023,"If you get a place, I'm sure the place is spectacular, but we were standing for an hour on the road that gives access and after more than an hour and having asked several times if we would have a place, they told all of us who were waiting that it was already full. Before going, we were calling by phone 3 hours before and there was no way that they would answer us."
17633,3131243,4,bia24,12/08/2023,"Area with exceptional view. In each pitch water and electricity. There is a lot of turnover, so it is easy to find a place. Convenient bus to get to the center."
17633,3127681,5,stephlaffi33,12/08/2023,"Get there early to get a seat, but it's worth it! The organization on arrival is... in short, you have to be patient. It's no use getting upset. But the pitches are spacious, the view of Bilbao incredible, access to Bilbao ultra easy with the 58 bus which passes next to the area (by the coin and a half). In short, it's worth getting up early to get there around 9 a.m. and wait there..."
17633,3125705,3,PIKEVESPA160,11/08/2023,"Area that in my opinion SOMETHING EXPENSIVE to be public and not have showers or sinks. It has a water and electricity connection (this is paid separately), in each square. As the Potty was being emptied next to the clean water intake, I witnessed while I was waiting for my turn, that a man put the water filling rubber IN HIS POTTY, well inside!!!!!, it is good for the views and for the communication."
17633,3117972,5,jean-christopheFigoni,10/08/2023,"An area at the top that offers a superb view day and night, it's a great light show. Super convenient with the bus and do not hesitate to go a little further 5 minutes higher is a local cafeteria with a very practical and pleasant shaded terrace."
17633,3113453,5,EvaCM85,10/08/2023,"We arrived yesterday (8/9/23) around 12 am, there were people waiting but we were able to park our motorhome. The girls who attended us were very kind and friendly, they even give you a map of the city so you can visit it. It would be great if they installed showers on site."
17633,3113191,1,davidemoretti73,10/08/2023,I had made a reservation through the site but at the time of my arrival they didn't accept me saying that I'm not on the list instead I had the confirmation email… impossible to find a place!! Not recommended for August it's all in the sun it's very hot
17633,3108553,5,cchacon86,09/08/2023,"Very good area, attentive staff. Large squares with incredible views. Good comunicated."
17633,3085352,5,MMMCLAM,06/08/2023,"Very good location, very well served by bus58 which passes every 30 min. We arrived without a reservation at 10:10. There were 4 motorhomes in front of us. We were able to have a place for 2 days. Really great. The organization / reservation of places should be improved so that it is really perfect but otherwise very very good"
17633,3084099,1,FJCALVOPOZO,05/08/2023,"Small area, insufficient for a city like Bilbao. It is on top of a hill, very far from the city (not bad milk). They didn't pick up our phone, and we found it full, and they don't let you put you in nearby places. Lost AC without knowing what to do and rolling haphazardly around the city. We left without being able to stop in the city. If you don't have a reservation, don't go. A big fail for the town hall."
17633,3083428,5,DavidPR89,05/08/2023,"Spectacular area, with incredible views of Bilbao! The only drawback is that it is a bit removed and the 58 bus passes every 30'. The fantastic services, the employees a 10, excluding the manager, who seems to be that customer service is not her thing... eskerrik disgust Bilbo!"
17633,3074031,4,jotseca,04/08/2023,Great views and having electricity and water on each plot is fantastic. Friendly staff and quiet place
17633,3072158,4,JasGruen,03/08/2023,"Nice view and cheap. Paid 25 euros for 2 adults, 2 children, our van and electricity. Toilets are available and you can dispose of everything and refill. Better bring your own hose, many flush their toilets with it. You can then take the bus to Bilbao."
17633,3069249,3,Lula2023,03/08/2023,"In itself very nice place. But unfortunately we didn't arrive until around 12:30 and didn't get a seat. However, there were still a lot of free parking spaces - probably reserved."
17633,3068686,3,Tatanka_Sr,03/08/2023,Very good view of the city and large plots. We arrived at 5:00 p.m. and they told us they were busy. The truth is that I was left with the doubt because several empty plots were noticeable.
17633,3060090,5,PapaCho,01/08/2023,"it's the best place to visit Bilbao. In high season arrive before noon. It would seem that reservations are possible but I cannot confirm it. The 58 bus is really perfect for getting down town. go to the terminus and you will be in the historic district. really nice and dynamic staff. if some comments speak of theft, it is sure the public car park next door."
17633,3054826,3,ErnestoJCA,01/08/2023,"The site has spectacular views of Bilvao, but you have to book well in advance, we arrived in the afternoon at about 8 o'clock and they told us at reception that everything was full from 1:00, a pity it looked good, we left for the area of motorhomes in sopelana as a second option, 18 min from there and great, a lot of space, quiet and with electricity."
17633,3050416,5,teatea,31/07/2023,"Go in the morning before 10-11 to find a place, paid €25 for one night with electricity."
17633,3044853,4,Lafamiliacrece,30/07/2023,Good place to visit the city.
17633,3044299,4,Josecar,30/07/2023,"Great area, with good views of Bilbao. Only 2 bathrooms, no shower, but very well prepared. Removed from the center, you have to get around by bus, which has a stop nearby. Next door there is a brewery where they serve food at a good price, and it is very good, although a lot of people usually go on weekends and you have to queue."
17633,3032377,4,maretxeur,28/07/2023,"A very good area, spacious squares, electricity and water in each plot, impressive views of Bilbao, the reception workers are super friendly and very competent, we will definitely return one"
17633,3026110,4,ducnaardezon,26/07/2023,Fine motorhome with a beautiful view. Bus stops nearby and takes you to the center of Bilbao. I made a reservation via email 2 days before arrival. you have to fill in a form and email it back.
17633,3024831,3,felipecampee,26/07/2023,"In the morning, the police cleared the space outside the official parking space and locked it. Our camper suddenly stood on the regular pitch... (The police must have towed our camper 100m away). The regular pitch seems to be fully booked from noon onwards. Ie arrive early."
17633,3022929,5,Maweiler,26/07/2023,"Beautiful parking space above the city with the option of gray water disposal and a toilet. No showers. We had a slightly sloping place but could be leveled with wedges. 2 people with a campervan €17/night was reasonable. In Bilbao itself, a number of vans were broken into, so we were very safe here. Definitely need to reserve. We were lucky we were the last ones to get a seat at 11 o'clock in the morning."
17633,3022709,4,VeroMojito,26/07/2023,21 € for 2 people. wonderful view especially at night. bus 58 at 5 mins for 1.75 per person. turn left on exit. Expensive shower: 6 €
17633,3022203,1,Derdeo,26/07/2023,"After several break-ins early in the evening amid the 60+ RVs that were staying in the parking lot in front of the full campsite, the parking lot was completely cleared by the police (friendly but firm) early in the morning! According to the police, no more overnight stays in the future!…..which seems to make sense in view of the various mobile home break-ins in Bilbao!"
17633,3019933,4,marielcaramel,25/07/2023,"Was full, but we spent the night at the parking lot. Seems to be tolerated to park there for the night. It was quiet at night, but the whole area had a very unpleasant smell in the late evening."

17633,3007062,4,Carriehome,23/07/2023,"Beautiful view! But a bit expensive, because it costs 17 euros plus 2 euros per person. Showers are paid (6 euros) in a nearby hostel. Little shade, but very windy, so it's good. There are toilets but the key is at reception. Comfortable bus, the last one to get on is at 10.40 pm. Electricity included and loading/unloading service."

17633,2994189,5,Zout49,20/07/2023,Great place to visit the city. We arrived on 7/19 around 10am and got room. I'm really starting over.
17633,2992074,4,jeroenvanrosmalen,20/07/2023,"The even places 2 to 20 also have first-class views of the city! 150 meters away is a very nice and spacious Basque restaurant: Cervecera Cobetas. Mainly local, simple, cheap dishes! Lasagne for 10 euros, very friendly staff! PS if you can't get a place anymore: in the public parking lot in front of it, 20-30 campers spend the night for free every night."
17633,2990085,4,lapequefamilia,20/07/2023,"Book in advance if you want to have a place. We arrived and it was full, they told us to come at 8 to see if we could get in, and we spent the night in the parking lot in front, limited to 1.95 meters but with a broken bar. The next day we went in. Perfect emptying and filling of water, they have hoses for filling and good areas of gray and black water."
17633,2989686,4,Gerda1999,19/07/2023,"Parking lot with great views over Bilbao and a good bus connection to the city (58, every 30 minutes). There is only 1 toilet for everyone / there are no showers. The price for electricity is 6 euros/ the parking lot is 17 euros."
17633,2985575,3,Baulina,19/07/2023,convenient place to spend the night. No shower only one toilet for the whole parking area. 17€ for a small Van. The plus is the bus that takes us downtown. fair.
17633,2983248,5,avasgon,18/07/2023,"Better with a reservation, but still, if you're lucky and get a place, it's well worth it!!! All services and very clean! And the best views!!!"

Drain/fill water and chemical toilet included, showers €6. Bus 58 takes you to the city, ATTENTION the last bus from the city to the parking lot is at 10.10pm. After that, only a taxi (from the Guggenheim we paid €8), by bus for 4 adults €6. Perfect, 7/17/23."
17633,2979786,5,tiitoran,17/07/2023,Great area. Super accessible even for large CCs. The only difficulty is to have a place: try to arrive at the end of the morning at the latest in the middle of summer I think. To go to Bilbao there is a bus or you can go there on foot (gugenheim 40 mins).
17633,2972256,5,alex.b33,16/07/2023,"nikel, well-maintained area. I recommend going to visit the old town. Beach possible at getxo by metro. Water, electricity and emptying possible. Only abuse the showers for 6 euros."

bit far from the city, 30 minutes walk on the way down, or bus 58 every 30 minutes. 
The person at the reception is very helpful !"
17633,2958049,5,haraldmaas,13/07/2023,"Fantastic view over the city. Nice big spots. Electricity and water at your spot. Bus to to city at the corner of the street takes you to the city. Runs every 30mins until 2230hrs.

Shame you can only stay 2 nights in this beautifull city."
17633,2953520,4,camperen21,12/07/2023,Seems like a really nice place but wonder until when it will be closed....which I understand from the previous review from July 11th. R&R
17633,2949908,5,3littlespirals,11/07/2023,"Warning! This place is closed for another week. You can stay at temporary parking space provided via BEC in the city it's located just behind BEC building. It's on park 4 night map as well. Water, electricity and wast dumping space provided and FREE."

17633,2934142,5,ClaudiaMercatali,07/07/2023,"Beautiful rest area, with views over the whole city of Bilbao. The whole city is lit up at night. Yes lighting, water and drainage but no shower."
17633,2931622,5,willphill,06/07/2023,"For what it is, its a perfect stayover. It overlooks Bilbao (amazing lights at night) and has a bus stop to the centre just outside of the entrance. Friendly staff and felt very safe. Fine for Motorhomes of all sizes (were were 8 meters, some were much larger..)"
17633,2927908,5,Maktedelic,05/07/2023,"The alternative place is insane. Send an email to the reservation mail and you will get the coordinates. The site is free, has toilets (Dixi) and urinals, free electricity and water and waste disposal. It's a bit noisy during the day as the highway goes by above, but it's free. Because of the BBK Festival, it has become a bit crowded since today. Many thanks to the city of Bilbao!"

17633,2915572,3,orly,02/07/2023,"The place is fact too.. don't torture yourselves up there! It is an impertinence. Your description must at least contain the addition that it is difficult to get up there with a larger WOMO, but you also have to come down again, and that with oncoming traffic, very adventurous..."

Otherwise you have to arrive by 10 a.m. at the latest. The square is ideally located to visit the city with the Guggenheim Museum (bus stop right in front of the square). Bread service at the reception, where you can also get the key to the toilet. V/E is ok, electricity is available on the pitch."
17633,2894532,1,sabimenendez,26/06/2023,"These days it is closed due to the logistics of the Tour de France, just like the San Mamés car park."

17633,2887137,4,Home79,24/06/2023,"Pitches up to max. 8m. Approach quite steep but doable. Also in the square area very steep access and exit to the upper level. Generous disposal - unfortunately at the toilet emptying there is a water hose that is used to flush toilets. As expected, some contemporaries also fill up with fresh water here. This should actually be done at the water taps on the pitches."
17633,2886930,3,joelponpon,24/06/2023,Area for a maximum duration of 48 hours. Very well located for visiting the city. Electricity and drinking water at each pitch. Too bad the employees pass the mower and the brushcutter from 08:00. 15€ all included. The girls at the reception are friendly and dedicated.
17633,2886400,5,elerdbeere,24/06/2023,"Great view! It is best to reserve in advance (at least 48 hours!)! Number 36 is the best! Otherwise the 30 numbers are all in the first row, best view! The bus leaves regularly in front of the parking space, very practical! If you haven't made a reservation, be there between 10-11 a.m. and you'll get a parking space!"
17633,2876215,5,ScottyJoeC,21/06/2023,Great views.  Bus stop very close.  Nice ladies and bread in the shop.

17633,2873475,4,schnorls,20/06/2023,"In general: Great Spot! Tidy, well organized. To be sure to get a spot, just write a mail in advance. Clearly marked places for every camper, enough space, water and electricity on every terrain. Well maintained. Great view on Bilbao and connected via Bus.
But in the evening/night a disgusting smell was all over the place for many hours. Hopefully that was just unlucky."
17633,2860197,5,Romu47,16/06/2023,Very clean and well located area with a magnificent view of Bilbao. Absolute calm. Full services. Reservations recommended as there are a lot of people.
17633,2855052,5,Apester2000,14/06/2023,"A little chaotic at the entrance but very quiet with sublime views over the city. You always had to get a key for the toilets. Since most of the neighbors were self contained, there was no queue for the toilet."
17633,2855045,4,JanineSantos,14/06/2023,"Beautiful campsite with a fantastic view over Bilbao. The ladies at the reception speak English but were very stressed at first. It's probably because we came without a reservation. Max. length of stay 2 days depending on when the arrival was. If it's a little quieter, you can get information at the reception on how to get to the city - bus line 58. Unfortunately no showers."
17633,2853945,5,BduS,14/06/2023,"Beautiful CP with super views of Bilbao. Terraced structure with reasonably spacious pitches that are not always level. All facilities are in good order and the sanitary facilities (only toilet) are clean. Good and friendly reception with lots of information. It's very crowded. Reservations recommended: min. 48 hours in advance via email. You can go to Bilbao on foot, by bike or by bus (20 minutes)."
17633,2851351,3,mrmoon80,13/06/2023,Parking area was full when we arrived at 14:00. We decided to park next to it on a regular parking area. Officially forbidden to park here with MH. We got robbed in an other public parking area. Bilbao government should consider extra guarded parking areas.
17633,2847477,5,Milisaracho,12/06/2023,Very complete. Beautiful views. Very friendly people! The best we went. You have to book by email. All those who arrived without a reservation did not have a place
17633,2847225,1,Anioucha,12/06/2023,Arrival 4 p.m. in June: full! We settled out of spite in the parking lot next door
17633,2846526,5,Costablanca,12/06/2023,"Great area to visit Bilbao, super wide squares, with water and electricity connection. Super friendly reception staff. Thanks to the Bilbao City Council for remembering those of us who came with a motorhome to see this beautiful city. It's a pity that you can only spend two days in Bilbao, well worth a week."
17633,2846458,2,jellys,12/06/2023,Arrived early at 12.00. Very busy lots of campers being turned away. You need to book by email 48hours in advance or no chance. This was not peak season. It looked like it was great and bus was very frequent.
17633,2837959,4,TomKral,10/06/2023,"Great reception, 2 ladies try very hard, be there before 11 a.m., otherwise it will be full! €15 including electricity. Toilet 7am-11pm, NO shower. Indescribable view over the city! Bus number 58 in front of the door (1.35€). Recommended for 1-2 days sightseeing."

17633,2818455,5,SimonF15,04/06/2023,"Really good value site overlooking Bilbao. All services included (water, power, waste etc.) Showers are available from a nearby associated hostel. The little shop in the site sells essentials. It’s very busy so book before if you can.  Although we turned up two days before our ferry and we’re able to get in. The staff were friendly and helpful - recommended."
17633,2812510,4,cfeickens,02/06/2023,Super nice and clean spot. The view is amazing and very easy to walk or get the bus to the musea or historical city center. The electricity and water on each spot are super easy. Besides that the city is gorgeous too. Really recommend this place.
17633,2811384,5,LesVentanousduVantana,02/06/2023,"Area very well located for a regional capital. Very warm welcome with a very methodical organization. It is essential to present yourself at the gate with the motorhome or converted van, otherwise you have to start the queue again. Area very well served by bus 58. Be careful, the tickets of this company are not the same as those of the tram!"
17633,2810657,5,Antide,01/06/2023,A ❤️ for campers - Thank you Bilbao. Beautifully located quiet place that is very well maintained. We have never been better in any city. And the ladies at the front desk are extremely friendly and helpful. Top.
17633,2809235,5,cage,01/06/2023,Good and cheap place to see Bilbao. We didn’t book in advance and had no issues arriving midday. Pretty tight but fine for one night. Pan available at the reception. The ladies at the reception are doing a great job.
17633,2800805,4,Knabsi,29/05/2023,"Lots of space and great views! Either reserve in advance or come early, otherwise everything is occupied. When making a reservation, say that you want to be in the first row, because you have the best view. Small minus as the toilets are not open 24 hours. But the view would be 6 out of 5 stars ;)"
17633,2785622,5,Heartracer,25/05/2023,"Super pitch. The price of €15 includes electricity and water. Toilets are open from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., keys are available at the entrance. As already described, the bus leaves every 20 minutes in front of the square. I would definitely recommend an online reservation (at least 48 hours in advance). Booking through the Bilbao Tourism website."

17633,2770837,5,Marion70,21/05/2023,"Great pitch to explore Bilbao. Bus stop for line 58 a little below the square or behind the public car park where many mobile homes also spent the night. If you want to stand here, be sure to book in advance. Requested by email, a registration form was returned, fill it out and the reservation was confirmed. Perfect. Very nice employees, everything was great."
17633,2766963,5,CBraams,20/05/2023,Great place. Extremely kindly helped by Eva and Mathias. But everyone is helpful. Everyone has their own power point and water can be filled and discharged. That for €15 per night! With bus 58 (goes every 20 minutes) you come to the old center for the bars with the best wine and tapas. A little further on is a hostel where you can shower and do your laundry for a fee. -shower €6 pp and laundry €4-
17633,2761619,5,JaviRoman,18/05/2023,Good place to rest with phenomenal views. Bus stop 100 meters away that takes you to the old part of Bilbao for €1.35. Highly recommended place.

17633,2750263,5,Northern_Fjells,14/05/2023,Great pitch with full service. Great views and only about 35 minutes into the city centre. Fees of €15 with water and electricity included is extremely cheap for such a big city.
17633,2736287,1,Burini,09/05/2023,We were not accepted as campers in a Fiat Doblo and sent back after waiting 20 minutes. The VW bus is of course a camper. Discriminatory
17633,2734249,4,vivi66,08/05/2023,I confirm the previous opinions beautiful car park with breathtaking views of Bilbao. Very safe to leave the motorhome when visiting the city. Bus nearby every 1/4 hour. A little disappointed the city is not very interesting.
17633,2733545,1,Calou1924,08/05/2023,"welcome not at all warm from the lady .. if you do not speak the language she does not care on the other hand those who speak it she makes big speeches ... the view bof which does not make you want to going to visit Bilbao, it's so ugly... The park is not well maintained... in short, go your way there is better further. . .."
17633,2733053,4,RuthandKoen,08/05/2023,"Didn't go completely smoothly, people pushing ahead while you run into the last spots. Disappointing from some campers. But ultimately fine with each own water point, electricity and gray and black water emptying. Camper is nicely inside the fences while you discover relaxed Bilbao."
17633,2724412,4,MarcosGD,05/05/2023,"Spectacular views. Level. I recommend going early, first thing in the morning, because it is always full. In April it cost us €15 per night with water and electricity. There are no showers but there are toilets. Maximum 2 nights"
17633,2723300,5,Hertha_b_grenzenlos,04/05/2023,"Arrived this morning - without a reservation. In the evening it was full. Super organized and great staff. When checking in, use the parking lot opposite the barrier and walk to the house. This avoids traffic jams when driving in, as there is little space. We didn't use the bus as we had a motorcycle with us. Shower and breakfast could be booked at a hostel for 5€"
17633,2721795,4,Isartk,04/05/2023,"well organized and quiet parking. descent on foot to the Guggenheim and downtown, beautiful walk along the river. return to the car park by bus, the stop of which is about 300m away."
17633,2721407,4,janomio,04/05/2023,"Beautiful view of Bilbao, very quiet and very friendly staff. For black water, an additional pipe should be provided because it is the same as that for clean water. Not very hygienic! Otherwise nothing to complain about."
17633,2719722,5,MaxDuquelu,03/05/2023,"Great place to stay and visit Bilbao. The bus 58 bring you to the old town in half an hour. Be sure to make a reservation, by mail, the place is almost always fully booked."

17633,2715408,2,beunaicheantoine,02/05/2023,ATTENTION thieves act on the parking lot waiting for access to the area. we have just paid for it. it's such a mess to get in that they take advantage of you leaving the vehicle for 2 minutes to steal what they find there. phone. satchel. etc lock your CCs. seems to happen frequently. otherwise yes the view is fantastic.

The lady on the phone told me that reservations can only be made by email and at least 48 hours in advance. She suggested that I be there by 10/10:30 the next day, which was not possible due to the distance."

The view of Bilbao is worth the trip"

Very clean toilets. Sorting bins nearby. Next to a large park and walking paths with free-roaming cows and horses. Bus 100m to the city center (1. 35€). Too bad we can't stay more than 2 days!
17633,2628617,4,iamdtl,28/03/2023,"perfect for a night near the city, bit of a walk to get into the city but good for hiking trails to the south.

Water re-fill, toilets, grey/black water drains for emptying.

Not 5star as toilets are annoyingly locked from 23:00 to 7:30 and there are no showers/washing-up sinks which you might expect for €12 in other places."
17633,2625979,5,the-globetrotter,26/03/2023,"Nice place with an outstanding view of Bilbao. There is no checkout time but always 24 hours after checkin.

17633,2614304,5,Amondsen,18/03/2023,"As a pitch top and with everything that the motor home owner needs. There is also WiFi at the reception. Bus into the city uncomplicated and a visit to the old town is also worthwhile. Tip: The driveway and curve to the upper part are a bit steep, vehicles with low ground clearance (e.g. water tanks or other substructures) tend to land. If necessary, therefore, reduce the load."
17633,2611901,5,Aviator,16/03/2023,"Simply great. Nothing to add to the 5* comments of the previous ones, and all for 15€! A real role model for every major city!"

17633,2609129,5,MarieG001,14/03/2023,"Fantastic place, exactly what everyone says. One warning though- we tried to take our dog on the bus into town. He is small, 5kg, and we sat him in a rucksack with just his head out. We were not allowed on the bus. We didn’t understand what the driver said except NO!  Is about 50min walk to Old Town. Had lovely time in Bilbao, great city."

17633,2588447,4,motogizzi,23/02/2023,Very nice pitch. Very nice lady at the reception. Bilbao can be reached on foot via stairs or small streets. We had our dog (small poodle) with us. Wanted to take a taxi on the way back. Both buses and taxis didn't want to take us!!!! Too bad. Not a dog friendly city.
17633,2586409,5,fschuetze,21/02/2023,Great place with a great view. You can stay for a maximum of 2 days. No dogs are allowed on the bus. So just take a taxi. Costs 12-14€ to the old town.

17633,2574579,4,AxelHutz,11/02/2023,Great view also or especially at night. By bus to the city every 20 minutes or on foot via the Camino de Santiago. Pretty quiet despite being close to town. Unfortunately no shower facility. Toilets very tidy but a bit complicated with key at reception. Perfect for the city trip!!
17633,2571531,5,WernerKlausberger,08/02/2023,"Wonderful place! Good view, very friendly staff, nothing more to say."
17633,2566735,4,polischka,02/02/2023,"great place. Friendly, Safe and Clean. However, the places were a bit muddy and the whole place smelled like gray water. This was probably related to previous rains. Absolutely nice people! Bus 1.35€ to the city center. Taxi to the Guggenheim about €14. I will come back! Thanks!"
17633,2562043,5,palmer3x,27/01/2023,"Great place to get to know the city, you can visit by bus line 58 100m from the campsite, the staff is totally cooperative and friendly, a small shop where they sell you bread and utensils for the Camper, a 24-hour coffee machine and vending inside, important Electricity and water included in the price on the plot itself."

17633,2547841,4,rogbi200,09/01/2023,"Great views over city, steep roads up to the Aire. Staffed reception access, needs registration, passport etc. my first pitch had dodgy power socket when I tested it and asked to change- staff member didn’t seemed concerned by faulty socket but she was helpful with bus routes etc. v lucky with bus both there and back, waited no more than 2 mins each way before bus arrived! Quiet but chilly night."

17633,2545356,1,gonzadriver,07/01/2023,"The services are correct, the area is great. We put one star because as soon as we got out of the van to check-in, they entered the van to steal our mobile phone. For the rest, the area is great, but you have to be careful because the city is what it has, many robberies. Surely they are waiting in the parking lot next door for anyone's mistake."
17633,2544468,4,usthree2021,06/01/2023,"Great view, friendly welcome. showers closed. Toilet keys must always be picked up at the entrance. Places all large, unfortunately muddy. It is best to choose a spot where the sun is shining! Nice little park around the corner - perfect for dog owners. Cycling up and down the mountain is a challenge! Bus only takes small dogs in backpacks."

17633,2538049,4,JoanCasas,02/01/2023,"A magnificent area, with beautiful views of Bilbao, especially on New Year's Eve. The area is very quiet and surrounded by green meadows. Bus stop very close. Electricity and water on each plot. Reception girls very friendly. They have bread and some other RV items. Pity about the bathrooms. There are only 3 toilets and you have to ask for the key. Even so, highly recommended area."
17633,2537834,4,toto125,02/01/2023,Superb area overlooking Bilbao Bus 58 takes you directly to the old town. Attention mandatory mask in transport. Too bad there are no showers. Parking 48 hours max. The person at the entrance very nice and speaks French
17633,2537401,4,maramariapi,01/01/2023,Amazing view over Bilbao. Unfortunately the hostel was closed for holidays so there were no showers and no breakfast option. Only four stars since the toilets were closed during the night anf one toilet seems not too much. Would still recommand it!

Magnificent view of the city. Quiet night. Bus 58 to go to the center (30mn to the terminus and after the bridge a very pretty old quarter) then 30mn on foot to the Guggenheim museum. A closer area would be great.
17633,2528676,1,Mockel,26/12/2022,"A good option for visiting Bilbao. Otherwise impossible. No shower, toilet only with key from reception. always only two nights in a row, whether full or empty!?"

17633,2516384,4,mariapa4182,08/12/2022,"The area is fine, the plots are spacious, the bus stop is practically at the door, but on rainy days like the ones I've had, the entire plot gets muddy. On the other hand, the bathroom hours are annoying , only from 8-23 and you have to go for the key every time you want to go, for me it is not comfortable, if it has bathrooms it has bathrooms without hours And like all areas far from the center"
17633,2514866,4,arcomanu,06/12/2022,"Quiet place with wonderful views and bus 150m from the door, bathrooms without showers until 23. Level pitches and although with some mud... they have a mesh that prevents you from getting stuck (at least in most places)"
17633,2513861,4,yannSaracchi,05/12/2022,"very well organized, electricity and drinking water on each spot, emptying on the route of the exit. only problem, we could not be straight because of the wet ground, we were stuck."
17633,2513122,4,LORENLOLES,04/12/2022,Very good area to spend 2 days in Bilbao. The only bad thing we have found is that after it has rained the squares are very muddy. There were spaces that could not be used and others with fallen trees
17633,2513083,5,mark213,04/12/2022,Good place to visit Bilbao.

17633,2509432,5,juansunder,30/11/2022,"area of 10 for everything. The lovely staff, they inform you of everything and help you at all times. the location is brutal the best views of Bilbao. You have the 58 bus every 20 minutes for €1.35 that leaves you in the center. we go a large area. To put a hitch, if they put 2/3 more WC and some showers it would already be Champions."
17633,2505430,4,celiwak,25/11/2022,A city stopover that does the job. Very nice home. Clean sanitary facilities and above all electrical terminals and water tap for each location. Park next door with picnic tables ideal for dogs. It's quite rare. Line 58 takes you to the city center in 20 minutes.
17633,2504050,2,MarjoleinVanDriessche,23/11/2022,"Very nice and well located motorhome with all the necessities. Now it is very quiet, and there are a lot of free places."
17633,2503994,5,Servandosaa,23/11/2022,"A place of Ac with all the necessary services. the bathrooms are only open until 11pm and you have to ask for a key. The rest is perfect, spacious spaces with a light connection, for only 15 euros, everything included. impressive views. a bit far from Bilbao but they tell us that there is a bus at the door."

17633,2503030,5,furgonetteando,22/11/2022,"Great area, €15 with electricity. Beautiful views and the bus stops at the door to go down to tour Bilbao. They explain everything great at the reception and they give you a map of the city. We will repeat without a doubt."
17633,2501046,5,Celia.,20/11/2022,"The best car park in Bilbao, we wanted to go to the football stadium because it was closer to the center, and it was closed. When you arrive they give you a map of Bilbao and they explain where to take the bus and what you need. We thought the bus ride would be longer, but not at all."
17633,2498548,5,Sweety33,17/11/2022,In this very quiet season .. services except shower .. magnificent view .. secure location .. very clean .. bread in the morning .. bus nearby to visit the city but mask compulsory and dogs prohibited .. be careful in Bilbao of thefts on the CCs..

17633,2496105,4,IrisKuiper93,15/11/2022,Beautiful view over the city. Pricey for the facilities there are (15 euros per night). There is a bus stop nearby that takes you to the center which was ideal. Popular and packed place. There is a toilet and a small shop. Safe place to stand.
17633,2495599,4,dmreina,14/11/2022,"Good site, large plots and fantastic views, it is far from the city, on a high mountain, but there is a bus, the 58. It has all the services, 15 euros a day. We have been great, totally recommended"

But we were able to park next door with our little Marco Polo and use the infrastructure. Very friendly staff. A good place for one night, unfortunately without showers and very few toilets."
17633,2484002,2,hekzeflekz,05/11/2022,"Nice view but that's about all. I think 15 euros for 24 hours is expensive for what there was. Toilet open from 7 to 11, not many toilets for how many places there were (1 man 1 woman 1 disabled), for which you had to go get the key again and again. Well friendly staff. But I might as well have parked in a free parking lot right now."
17633,2482536,5,Bajonska,04/11/2022,"Large site with great view. Water and power hookup at every pitch. Helpful, friendly staff. Good bus connection to town.

17633,2481432,2,Bulli4Dreams,04/11/2022,"Located on the Altamira hill with great views over Bilbao. Very quiet area (there is nothing) ... there are no showers (for a fee, € 5 at a hostel I didn't understand where) ... the 3 bathrooms (1 man, 1 woman, 1 disabled) closed from 21:30 at 7:00 and maybe more, by the time they might be more used. Of course the cost is low ... but it gets better ..."
17633,2480156,4,FredFlintsone,03/11/2022,"Super nice view. Great location for taking the bus into town. Adjacent park & a beer garden within walking distance. Star deduction: You can hear the street from the lower parking spaces, as the cars and campers accelerate very loudly up the path."
17633,2479652,5,JeremyTania,02/11/2022,"magnificent view of the city, with a beautiful park behind. A wonderful welcome. The parking lot was full but very quiet for sleeping. The city center very accessible by bus, 15 min."

17633,2470417,5,isayjavi2209,30/10/2022,"Extraordinary view and with all the services, totally recommendable and without a doubt I would repeat it, Bilbao one step away to get to know it."
17633,2468171,1,elerirj,29/10/2022,"1 toilet for a full site of people that they keep locked, huge queues, and they shut the toilets over night. Rude staff. For the price you might as well be in a campsite with access to basic facilities"
17633,2467850,5,Bob100,28/10/2022,"What a view especially at night over the whole of Bilbao.
Secure site with all facilities for €15

17633,2466502,5,skipper59,28/10/2022,"Very place, good reception, excellent starting point to visit the city. The downside is that it is better to book to be sure of having a place. Please note that the stay is limited to 2 days. We have been here for 2 days and the wind has been blowing hard at night, be careful with your satellite antennas and your skylights (altitude and acceleration effects linked to the profile of the terrain). With these precautions everything is perfect."
17633,2466023,5,tonigoyi,27/10/2022,"an exceptional site the only thing that is only two days but good to see bilbao. the super wonderful person who attended us divinely informs you of where you have to take the bus that is good to see in the surroundings. ten with ten, the only drawback I see is that you can only stay two days but they do it so that we can enjoy the site with more motorhomes. a site that I recommend"
17633,2465516,3,Isabel567,27/10/2022,"I give it 3 stars for the location. How far is it to the town. Still fine. The areas are spacious, there are bathrooms, two water recharge and discharge areas and it has incredible views of the city since it is very high and far away. You can take the bus to go down to the city but if you go to dinner you will have to return by taxi, from the old town about €13."
17633,2463081,5,Hasen,26/10/2022,Great to visit Bilbao. The bus takes you quickly to the city. Masks are still mandatory on the bus ;)
17633,2462673,3,martes40,26/10/2022,"Comfortable area located outside the city. Possibility to go to the city center on foot (big climb on the way back) or by bus. A little expensive but electricity, water on each pitch. 2 toilets for the entire area... Please note that it is not quiet at all: in front of a fairly busy road, next to a bar with boom boom music until late at night and on the other side dogs howling at death at night. .."
17633,2459876,4,Katka74,24/10/2022,"A place with a view of the city. Excellent bus connection. The downside is that the toilets are locked - the key must be asked at the reception, but only during opening hours. There is no shower in the building. Water and electricity on the plot, sink at the exit."
17633,2459533,1,SuusenHans,24/10/2022,"Called them 4 times, no answer. Mailed 2 times and they said we are welcome.
When we arrived at 10.00 am they told us there was no space anymore.... showed them the mail without any result. 
TERRIBLE ORGANISATION!!!!!!!!!!
Went for a parking place nearby, no problem."
17633,2458482,5,ademortier,23/10/2022,A magnificent view and all the services. Bus 58 to go downtown. Do not hesitate to go to the terminus. You will find the beautiful market and a nice walk there.

17633,2457104,4,thoka26,22/10/2022,"Very nice place in two floors, great view of the city. Unfortunately, the LTE reception here is miserable, no matter which provider, so if you want to work from the camper, you hardly have a chance here."

17633,2442142,5,theroadlesstraveleddutchies,13/10/2022,"Super cool place, with a beautiful view over the city! With the bus, which stops practically in front of the motorhome, you are in the city after a few stops. At a walking distance of 3.4 km, it is also doable as a walk. The pitches are generally quite flat, but there are also quite a few sloping pitches. Electricity and water are available on your own spot."
17633,2441570,5,Goerch,13/10/2022,Great view over the city. Everything given and easy to reach. Can only recommend

17633,2435327,5,CarolinHintz,10/10/2022,"Amazing view over Bilbao and good bus connection to the old city center. 
The reception is open between 8am-11pm, like the toilets (key at reception), no showers, electricity for each place! 
We recommend!"
17633,2434451,3,travlr,09/10/2022,"Nice view over Bilboa. Simple place with electricity, flat rate 15€. Unfortunately, toilets locked/not accessible overnight. City easily accessible by bus (mask requirement). Unfortunately, reception only speaks Spanish and is a bit taciturn."
17633,2424808,5,Friegelow,05/10/2022,"Great place with a perfect view! The two ladies at reception were very friendly. As already mentioned -> the place is terraced, so that you always look at the city. You can order a baguette for the morning. The key for the toilet is with the ladies in the cottage. The bus into town stops right in front of the road. We can only recommend this place."
17633,2423582,3,RichyG,04/10/2022,Very nice location. Terraced with great views of Bilbao. For the many pitches only one toilet for women and men (not lockable) but clean. Electricity included. Bus stop in front of the parking lot. bread service!
17633,2423115,4,L159,04/10/2022,great place we didn't reserve and were received very friendly (English & German spoken) Bus connections to the city every 20 minutes. We went to the museum by taxi: 13€ one way. At 5 p.m. there are still enough parking spaces available.
17633,2419552,4,Pepepoti,03/10/2022,"Quiet area and well located. It is elevated and with impressive views of Bilbao. WC services damaged during our visit and some more are missing, such as showers. Many squares and wide, being able to unfold awning and table with chairs. The price is not bad for what it is."
17633,2418948,1,gemahn,02/10/2022,"The reservation procedure is questionable and unfriendly. Requested in English, response in Spanish. Apparently fully booked 3 days before desired arrival. Then we just forgo the great view."
17633,2417383,5,bussweber,02/10/2022,"Cool place, reserve 48h before if you want to be sure of a seat. Dream view of Bilbao, which msn must not have seen, except for the Gugenheim Museum of course."
17633,2415367,4,Tripower,01/10/2022,Great place. Safe with a fantastic view of Bilbao. The bus goes right in front of the door. Cons: Only one toilet and no shower on site. Reserve the day before.
17633,2414673,5,solaf,30/09/2022,"Top view over Bilbao. 15 euros, fair price. Bus 58 takes you to Bilbao in 25 minutes. You should arrive before 12pm to get a seat. Extremely friendly uncomplicated reception. Everything perfect!"
17633,2412726,4,ceciliadieste,30/09/2022,"The view of Bilbao is spectacular and there is a bus that leaves you in the center. Water and electricity on the plot, very practical. The only con is that there weren't enough toilets for the amount of people. Very professional and clear staff. highly recommended"

17633,2406400,4,joseenrob,27/09/2022,"A spot without a reservation. We have tried to make a reservation twice, but many groups come at the end of September and then they do not reserve separate places shortly in advance. We were there around 10 am and got a nice spot on the outskirts with a beautiful view of Bilbao."
17633,2402773,5,ADAGIO29,25/09/2022,"So there, hats off. Who will beat this area with its fantastic view of Bilbao, its calm, the complete and well-maintained facilities? at each site (very large) its elect terminal. and a water tap. This all perfect for 15 euros elect. understood. Thank you and well done."
17633,2394196,4,ConorQ,22/09/2022,"Extraordinary view of the city, decent facilities and cheap price. Served as a decent starting point for us as we rented our van in Bilbao. Far away from the city and a very difficult walk home (although there was a bus too) so not idea for a city visit"
17633,2383593,5,micky57,18/09/2022,"not easy to get a place to book 48 hours in advance by email... so we came early in the morning. Great view,. bus to the city center very close. friendly welcome for us contrary to some comments. calm night."

It was ok for one night but I wouldn't come back here again."
17633,2378702,5,saladaresort,17/09/2022,"Incredible area with incredible views… 100% recommended, although a bit far from the city… Uber for €10 to the Arenal area because I took my dog and a bus stop 50 meters away. a 10"

Leaving to the left, bus stop number 58. €1.35. It leaves you both in the museum and in the part old Bilbao. you have to get off at the last stop"
17633,2376508,1,YackyX,16/09/2022,"Worst reception ever. I repeat, worst reception ever."
17633,2374065,5,J.koldo,15/09/2022,"Very well prepared area with exceptional views. Very quiet to sleep. In the parking lot next to this area you cannot park or spend the night in a motorhome or camper, it is prohibited. The local police impose fines and if you are from outside Spain, they charge you on the spot. For the all very good. It is advisable to book online."
17633,2373815,4,europatourdreen,15/09/2022,"Wonderful place to visit Bilbao! Stayed one night for only 15 euros. No showers, but toilet and other services. Friendly ladies! We were in the morning and luckily still had room, but come on time… then best chance. We walked to the Guggenheim museum, theme different every week. This time cars. Of course we ate pinxtos!"
17633,2371240,4,AnniePatrick,14/09/2022,"Impossible to stay in this area which looked very nice, the receptionist told us that we had to book 48 hours in advance at this time, mid September!! And if you can't reach her by phone, especially try email, it works better, I heard it said to someone on the phone!"
17633,2369910,3,axgmobil,14/09/2022,"Parking space at the top of the mountain, great view of the city, unfortunately the space was full when we arrived, but we were able to park in the adjacent parking lot with 20 other campers. The next morning we were able to move to the square. Only 3 toilets (m/f/disabled) you always have to get the key from the reception! A bit impractical! But clean. The 58 bus is a great way to get to the city!"
17633,2366213,4,Lucilayne,12/09/2022,"The place seemed nice, but it was fully book when we arrived, so I would recommend booking before going. it was a Mo day in mid Septmber, so I thought it wasn't necessary"

17633,2356155,5,carbajal,09/09/2022,"Recommended area, large plots, with power outlets in each plot. There is a bus service that runs at half and hour, you can take the bus both to the right and to the left of the exit of the area, it takes you to the Rivera market, in the center. The area costs €15 with electricity emptied and filled. The showers €5."
17633,2350149,3,A2Vince,07/09/2022,"Impossible to find the number to reserve before but arriving at 6:30 p.m. there was still room. The pitches are not large but for one night and at 15€ it's very good (electricity and water included). The view is great, however, streetlights on all night and a dog barking in a nearby farm."
17633,2348923,1,anniedid,07/09/2022,poor reception and the speech is not the same for each member of staff. we put ourselves in the adjacent car park.. many motorhomes.
17633,2343096,1,RalfRomy,05/09/2022,"Monday afternoon. According to the operator, everything is full. No helpful staff. Were not allowed to park in the adjacent parking lot. We were very disappointed and won't be coming to Bilbaos again."
17633,2342400,4,MC1960,05/09/2022,area on the heights of the city well served by bus 58 which takes you to Bilbao. There are always people to welcome you. Satellite TV ok. 15€ per night. We're a little stuck up but that's okay.
17633,2339785,5,Busero,04/09/2022,Spectacular. I recommend it.

17633,2335421,4,DavidDiezNieto,03/09/2022,"Highly recommended area, unbeatable quality price. somewhat complicated to get to, but with all the services, bathrooms (without showers and from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., asking for the key), electricity, water and gray and black water emptying area. Unbeatable views, you can see the entire city. The wifi only works near the reception. It is recommended to go with a reservation. Bus a few minutes and leaves you in the center"
17633,2335192,4,Abdel6433,03/09/2022,"Great place to spend some time. I stayed there for 2 nights, everything is available. Electricity, water, toilets, emptying of gray water and waste water. Finally, the view is magnificent in Bilbao"
17633,2335179,1,em4pantelic,03/09/2022,"On request they still had room for us, were friendly. When we said we were traveling in a big car with a built in bed, we were dismissed and rude. Would be a great location but really disappointing how it played out!"
17633,2333118,5,ManuCalvo,02/09/2022,"Good spaces and the possibility of filling with water and emptying gray and black water. Bathrooms with a key that you have to ask at reception, it does not have showers. In addition to the 58 you can also walk down to Basurto and take the tram to go to the Guggenheim. To go up it is necessary the 58, which can be taken in Autonomy, 13."
17633,2331275,5,Gaelle74,02/09/2022,Perfect for visiting Bilbao! Places large enough so we are not too stuck. Bus right next door every 30min. Just remember to book at least 48 hours in advance if you want to be sure to have a place.
17633,2329389,4,Pierbattista,01/09/2022,"Nice rest area, quiet, with a nice view over the city. Well served by public transport (bus n 58). It is essential, at least in high season, to book at least 48 hours in advance by sending the appropriate form. Otherwise you do not enter."
17633,2323071,5,KaneloAntonio,30/08/2022,Good area with all services including electricity for €15 with a spectacular view of Bilbao and very well connected to the center of Bilbao by bus 58 Recommended
17633,2321084,4,onthegowithflow,30/08/2022,"Good place to spend the night if you want to visit the city. Parking is not safe in the city, there are a lot of burglaries. So be smart and put your RV here on the secure site. Too bad there are no showers! Very friendly spoken by the lady who was there, got a good explanation about the bus. Bus stops less than 50m from the motorhome and costs €1.35."
17633,2307435,4,judithacha,27/08/2022,"Good area with large plots of grass, €15 with electricity included, well connected to get to know the city. right next to it there is a parking lot and they let you spend the night, we have also seen that they had a security guard."
17633,2303503,4,Alpenzauber78,26/08/2022,"Despite the lack of a reservation, we got a great seat on the second attempt. Is probably a bit dependent on the contact person. For 15 euros there is electricity and overnight stays on a spacious plot, a small shop on the square and a bus stop 5 minutes away. You rarely get it for 15 euros (camper, 2 adults, child, dog). We are totally satisfied. Great, clean pitch!"
17633,2299406,4,Evertrenske,25/08/2022,"Camper place is often full, you can book in advance!! There is no shower on the motorhome, only a tap and toilet. We had no reservation and eventually stood in the parking lot to the motorhome, free !! Was absolutely great."
17633,2297590,1,PedroRaul,25/08/2022,"The only good thing is the views of Bilbao.! The rest a 0! The treatment of the girl who attended us was a shame..!! Having free plots he did not let us enter and on top of bad manners ..!! It does not have showers, a simple bathroom of a construction hut and that's it...!! We stayed in the parking lot next door supposedly waiting for our turn to enter and they passed it through the lining... in the morning they passed as it arrived"
17633,2294181,1,Juaneti,24/08/2022,"€15 yes or yes, it doesn't matter if you park or if you're just going to unload. if you tell him that you just want to unload and then he won't let you park. Having paid €15!!"
17633,2293733,5,oxi79,24/08/2022,"Great pitch with an outstanding view (currently fireworks in the evening) on Bilbao. Downtown next to bus also within walking distance. Electricity and water directly on site. Due to high occupancy, an early arrival is recommended. At least 6 mobiles were turned away last night."
17633,2288151,1,katie49,23/08/2022,"we went yesterday and at the reception, we are told that it is complete when there were plenty of places. Very disappointed with the way we were greeted, very expeditious!"
17633,2284387,5,aurelappius,22/08/2022,"Great pitch with a fantastic view of the whole city from above. We arrived around noon and were given a seat without a reservation. (Arrival a bit chaotic) 15€ per night for a guarded pitch with toilets, electricity and water is really fair. It is important to know that you can stay a maximum of two nights. The bus runs regularly into town and back."
17633,2279239,2,Carlosb1,21/08/2022,Too far from Bilbao and impossible to return in the afternoon since the last bus is at 9. Difficult access with large cars
17633,2261866,4,Ridadena,18/08/2022,"Quiet area, with spectacular views of Bilbao. Possibility of reserving bread. Spacious pitches and with electricity. There are toilets, no showers. Very friendly staff."
17633,2258514,5,AnitadeKorver,17/08/2022,"Great place to visit the city, nice view indeed. You could even buy a baguette at the reception in the morning. Arriving on time is a must (at least in the high season when we were there). In case it is full, there is a large parking lot next to the parking where you can park for free, even there I would have felt safe, it looked like a village above Bilbao"
17633,2250479,3,lthibal,16/08/2022,"Arriving in the car park opposite the parking area, a Frenchman informs us that the campsite is full. We inquired nevertheless and we did not have the same return. Indeed certain people are refused whereas many sites were free. Night ok, some noise with barking dogs at night.2 night max, friendly people and great view of bilba"
17633,2247522,5,Berli.mendoza,16/08/2022,"An area with impressive views of the city of Bilbao, with services, electricity and good plots...!!"
17633,2245379,4,Alessandrobottani,15/08/2022,"Well managed camper area, a bit far from the center but. Well served by public transport, quiet location with little noise, in August it is better to book in advance. Very nice staff"
17633,2238418,1,latancheb,14/08/2022,"very complicated to get in, too bad because the view must be wonderful, especially at night. but the problem is that it seems that the Spaniards have priority segregation not normal. more room for the french but weird place for the locals."
17633,2234547,5,sgv4,14/08/2022,Perfect area. Water and electricity on the plots and quite wide. Bus stop close by. It is very good that you can make a reservation so you can enter at the time you want and have a place.
17633,2234054,4,LindiHB,14/08/2022,"Good parking space above Bilbao. Only toilets (clean!), no showers. No reservations possible - first comes first! Arrival therefore very stressful, because there is no real waiting area for parking. We were able to park on the street with our Bulli and were lucky and got a nice parking space with a view of the city. We then walked (4KM) down to the old town and up again in the evening. There is also a bus."
17633,2233599,5,sosobeubeu,14/08/2022,Area on the heights of Bilbao bus line 58 for 1.35€ which takes you directly to the city center. Very friendly staff and clean area. The night is 15€ water and electricity
17633,2226304,1,LlunaOnaRoc,13/08/2022,Without a reservation they didn't let us in!
17633,2218786,1,perichs,11/08/2022,"very badly we go to Bilbao, with four hours of travel and when we arrive although there is room they tell us that it is full that they are waiting for 8 ac. I think this should not be, now if they don't go because they have changed their minds, what? There is another area nearby and it is free and the train is next door. Thank you for not letting me in I will not visit you anymore"
17633,2215766,5,pambrundelphine,11/08/2022,"Superb, beautiful view and warm and friendly welcome. Very clean and pleasant place. Practicality of the shuttle every half hour. Alas return early, the last bus 58 is at 22:30. But next to the parking lot, a small restaurant that is worth a visit. Local atmosphere, tapas, plato combinado, cervesa... And Bilbao, of course, sublime."
17633,2212368,5,GiovanniLeone,10/08/2022,"Difficult to find a place but it is worth it. Do not go to the cervecera nearby, rude and inhospitable to foreigners."
17633,2211752,2,nat123216,10/08/2022,"the services are also paying the lady asked us 15th to fill in water, drained gray water and box despite the parking lot being full"
17633,2210120,1,titisevh,10/08/2022,"FATAL! We only came to discharge water and they didn't let us because they said they were full, when we saw that they had a lot of space. It is the only place in this area that there is to load and unload, what is the point of not allowing us to do it? In addition, the girl who attended us was unfriendly! Fatal, Fatal, Fatal! Never more! This site is nonsense!"
17633,2207251,4,AmumoMumo,10/08/2022,"Good space to spend a couple of nights. Magnificent views. Book 48 hours in advance by mail. If it is not done, they may not have places. They should improve WC, there is only one and with a key."
17633,2205302,4,Mbwa,09/08/2022,If you want to be sure to have a place it is better to book by email Payment is made on arrival with ID. Otherwise well placed area with bus 58 which takes you to Bilbao. Nice view and good location.
17633,2193767,3,AnitaFarlaine,07/08/2022,"I'm from Bilbao. The area is very remote, good views but it is on top of Mount Kobetamendi. I doubt that there is means of transport at night. Bilbao has a very good metro connection with nearby municipalities... It seems to me a somewhat complex way of visiting Bilbao."
17633,2190804,5,jmdesveaux,07/08/2022,"Magnificent view of Bilbao. Well located area with the 58 bus which takes you to the old town for 1.35 eur. Only downside, only one toilet with key that is collected at reception. Remember to book 48 hours in advance. Many were turned away when they arrived in the afternoon without a reservation. 15eur for 2 adults and a motorhome with electricity and water on site"
17633,2187010,5,Nige64,06/08/2022,Excellent for 2 day maximum stop over for visiting Bilbao. There is a bus stop out side which takes you into town for €1.30. There are limited toilet facilities but it is a campervan park not a camp site. Make sure you pre book as it is very busy
17633,2183308,5,vicenteleal,06/08/2022,"Perfect area to visit Bilbao, bus every half hour, very friendly reception, in August almost always full."
17633,2181636,2,icnt,05/08/2022,"Full area, we couldn't spend the night. We wanted to empty it and they told us that it is not allowed if you are not from Bilbao or if you spend the night of course! Anyway! We couldn't get in!"
17633,2180880,5,Tomtomdeuz,05/08/2022,"Perfect for visiting the city, bus line nearby. Spectacular site overlooking the city. In high season, you must book 48 hours in advance or show up early in the morning (9am). We managed to get a seat early."
17633,2180865,5,MartinFidel,05/08/2022,"Excellent staff, area, views of Bilbao. We walked to the stadium, museum, old town and…bus 58 back. Thank you Bilbao for your kindness and gastronomy."
17633,2179383,5,Elisopola,05/08/2022,"Camper area in a panoramic place! You can admire the whole city from above! € 15 for 24 h! Very comfortable pitches! Loading and unloading service! Very nice staff! At 200 meters there is a very nice restaurant. I think it's the only really safe place to visit the city! Nearby you have the bus stop, we travel by scooter."
17633,2171713,4,Ulisse84,04/08/2022,"Panoramic rest area over the city. There are all the services, including the bathrooms (without showers) open until 11pm. Check-in is a bit difficult because it is long by the operators, but you can enter if there is room even without a reservation. Obviously, it is better to arrive early in the morning because there is a lot of change. Bus 58 takes you comfortably downtown. Tickets (around € 1.50) can be purchased on the bus."
17633,2165189,2,HristoFabritsiov,03/08/2022,It's full. Difficult without reservation. Far to go on foot to Bilbao but there is a bus. Nice views from the top of the hill. Free parking right in front for small vans. I don't understand why they close the bathrooms after 11:00 p.m. and during the day too but they leave you the key. I understand that if I pay they have to give me all the services they offer 24 hours a day.
17633,2164168,1,VirginiaPhipps,02/08/2022,"Not allowed to use the services here unless you are staying the night. We arrived and wanted to empty our chemical toilet, however the worker said the municipality do not allow it."
17633,2159029,2,smclslmc,01/08/2022,"reception friendly. Despite the notice at the barrier, the space was full, asked and got a good seat. Bus 58 runs cheaply to and from the city. Flat surface with electricity and water. Next to the square there is free standing in the parking lot. The toilet is shared because nobody is paying attention. There is a toilet for women and men. With 70 seats plus neighbors, that means waiting. Unnecessarily, the toilet is locked between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m. Overall, at 15 euros, it's an expensive parking lot with no real added value."
17633,2157533,1,thierrymyriam,01/08/2022,please specify that the area is only accessible by reservation
17633,2157280,5,erikvanb,01/08/2022,Great place. Large spots. At the 1st of august 2022 at 17hours the space was not completely full yet. But you can be unlucky in high season.
17633,2154904,3,kafunek,01/08/2022,Great views of the city and large squares. Only 2 toilets that are open from 8:00-23:00 - key must be collected from reception.
17633,2153979,4,corpes4x4,31/07/2022,Effective place to visit Bilbao. Bus nearby to get off for a visit to Bilbao with very good views close by. It seems that there are also hiking trails that we didn't use. It's usually full. We were lucky to find a place and had a quiet night.
17633,2149795,4,MacGhisl,31/07/2022,Pleasant motorhome area with a view of Bilbao below
17633,2131704,4,jacastellano,27/07/2022,A spectacular place for both views and services and a very pleasant night connected to the center with bus 58. Highly recommended
17633,2119944,5,Noowanda,25/07/2022,"Good place to park cars, caravans and vans. You can choose the payment area for 15 euros and get hooked on the light and drain water. Or you can park outside without electricity without paying anything. Good place if you have a trailer of any kind. both inside and outside"

It is very well organized and not very flexible because it is always full. Registration 48 hours in advance is actually necessary, arrival should be by 12 noon. Toilets available, supply and disposal also."
17633,2049791,1,cicciocav,08/07/2022,"Alternatively, a caravan park has been temporarily opened in Kalea Carlos Ibañez, 2 at the Bilbao Exibition Center. Great for visiting Bilbao and staying overnight, free with electricity services. Guarded."
17633,2039689,5,Vilamajor1980,05/07/2022,"Perfect area to stay a few days and visit Bilbao. We stayed 2 nights. There were about 20 AC and Campers. We were there 10, 11 March 2022"
17633,2019927,5,clemR,28/06/2022,Parking area closed from 29/06/2022 at 12 noon until 22/07/2022 due to the Bilbao BBK live festival. Parking of campers during this period will be at the BEC (Bilbao Exhibition center) car park of almacenes (exterior) Free parking
17633,2017523,5,TinaMaren,28/06/2022,"Space is good, but closes on June 29th for a month due to a festival. But here is some information: Advance reservation makes sense, must be 48 hours in advance. Our dog (small) with a muzzle and bag was allowed on the bus. But it was probably one Exception! Back we took a taxi for 8 euros. Guggenheim is easy to reach by taxi for 8 euros - if the dog stays in the mobile home. Online purchase saves 2 euros."
17633,2008188,5,TomasLl,25/06/2022,"Safe place, good deal, and about 25 minutes by bus (1.35 euros) from the old town. Buses every 30 minutes until 22.40. It is appreciated to leave the camper in a safe place. Emptying of gray and black water, toilet and water load. Possibility to buy bread"
17633,2003861,3,helguilrec,23/06/2022,"Fair spot to spend the night. Not much shade but convenient if you want to visit Bilbao (15 minutes by bus). Small parcels, really close to neighbours. There's a huge and lovely park at a 2-minute walk distance."
17633,1995395,5,Mike_wood,20/06/2022,"Great spot to park up for a couple of nights. The view really makes this place, wonderful view over Bilbao. We emailed ahead to secure a site, would recommend to do that. Think you need to give 48 hour notice. Staff very friendly and helpful. Easy access into Bilbao via a bus that just stops down the road. Definitely would stay again"
17633,1994632,4,denech17,20/06/2022,"All right, all you need. Bilbao, not much to see."
17633,1988078,4,Bighairypict,18/06/2022,"Does what it says on the tin with no frills. Very busy on the Saturday we visited. Friendly folk in reception told us it was full but found space to squeeze us in. there were still pitches not claimed after reception closed so we moved to proper pitch with electric. Best to book ahead, I think.

handy wee shop for essentials in reception."
17633,1985837,3,Costablanca,17/06/2022,We planned to go at the end of the month and luckily I called to find out and they confirmed that they close the area on June 29 for a full month.
17633,1984791,4,Ginabi,17/06/2022,"Highly recommended for visiting Bilbao. Friendly reception, seats okay, could move because it was quite loud on the street (baby on board). Great view, we didn't use the sanitary facility. VE in disgusting condition. According to the staff, it was fully booked but there were still plenty of free places in the evening."
17633,1976888,3,ducas,14/06/2022,"Price is ok, but its hard to get a place if you come in the afternoon."
17633,1973970,5,travel2022jt,13/06/2022,Great place above the city. We were completely satisfied and stayed two nights. There is a toilet and a great bus connection directly into the city. The perfect place to stand relaxed in Bilbao!
17633,1973045,3,Tim95,13/06/2022,"Very nice place with a great view over Bilbao The places for the campers are staggered according to size, so it can be that you don't get a place despite free places This system is not necessarily followed consistently The employee on our arrival day was unfortunately very unfriendly. He didn't point us out of the system but wanted to send us away after paying because of the size"
17633,1971794,5,iele123,12/06/2022,"excellent stop, if you arrive in the morning you can find a place, in the afternoon you can not, you can book, but at least 48 hours before your arrival. I didn't book, but I stopped anyway. Bathrooms yes, shower no. € 15 per night. Convenient bus 58 for the city center."
17633,1970015,5,faucouit,12/06/2022,spacious and very well maintained area! easy access to Bilbao center by bus or even on foot for the bravest (lots of stairs) I recommend without reservation!
17633,1970013,4,mariu2021,12/06/2022,"Good size of the stall with electricity and water, decent clean keyed services, public transport 200m for the bus to downtown Bilbao, great views! The only problem is it is allowed to stay ONLY for 48 hours, no more! Motorhome two people one dog electricity € 15 per night."
17633,1959296,4,Brestan,08/06/2022,Friendly welcome. 15€/day including electricity for campers and 2 people. Everything as described. Bus connection 58 good every 20min. Get off at Calle Autonomia in front of Plazza Zabalburu and walk through beautiful Bilbao to the museum. There is a great restaurant 300m down the road to the south from the parking space. You don't need to order pizza or Indian via UberEats. Are you crazy? Recommendation for the place.
17633,1958570,5,kazimoto,08/06/2022,"A motorhome area with all services, close to a bus stop (58) which allows you to reach the historic city center, the Guggenheim museum quickly for 1.35€ ... nothing to say. The reception staff are welcoming and professional. We stayed there for 48 hours"
17633,1954303,5,DrAle,06/06/2022,"We arrived late at night, minutes from closing. The attention was very cordial, they explained everything we needed and the place that we had was great. A great view of the city at night and even better in the morning. Very neat service areas. It was absolutely packed, we were very lucky to find an available spot. Highly recommended."
17633,1954184,5,bulli44210,06/06/2022,Stunning ! An exceptional view of Bilbao for 15€ including electricity and wifi (ok the toilets are condemned!) but with the bus 5 min away you can't dream of a better city. In addition Bilbao is a very pleasant city. We had not reserved and at 2 p.m. we had a place without problem
17633,1954037,5,AlNev,06/06/2022,"Absolutely brilliant site, great views of Bilbao, 58 bus takes you to the old town in twenty minutes, friendly staff, what's not to like.."
17633,1947676,3,aileen108,05/06/2022,"Great view of Bilbao. There’s nowhere to pull in when you arrive to check in, so this creates a huge queue of campers on the road which is a hassle for locals and anyone returning to the site after a drive.Clean toilets but you’re required to get a key from reception which seems needless - they lock the toilets from 11pm - 8am which also seems unnecessary. Only place in Bilbao so book in advance."
17633,1943139,1,LaEternidad,03/06/2022,"I have given it a star, because I cannot give it less, very far from the city, poor attention, with very little desire to attend. They tell you that there is Wi-Fi but at the entrance you are in your motorhome or camper and the Wi-Fi does not reach you, all that for an incredible €15, a bad area, being the only one in the city, so they take advantage of it… good views…. If they give you the first one as I touch you like my back... you don't see anything"
17633,1941454,5,retirement,03/06/2022,"Fantastic, brill views, massive site, all pitches have electricity and water. Toilets available, place to empty toilet and grey waste, cheap, only 15 euros per vehicle, close yo number 58 bus stop, only 1. 35 euros to town, bus every 20 mins. Would stay again."
17633,1939590,5,JMula,02/06/2022,"Great place, just make sure to make a reservation (preferably 48h before). The high season is here and it may be hard to find a spot otherwise."
17633,1939579,1,guitart,02/06/2022,Arrived without booking at 3:30. But full by reservation. Need booking.
17633,1935487,4,zachariah273,31/05/2022,Decent aire with great views of the city but it is a good 45 minute walk to the Guggenheim etc. Toilets on site but you have to sign out a key which is excessively bureaucratic.
17633,1930215,5,Nmaccann,30/05/2022,Excellent site. Ignore the bad comments. Simply book ahead. Easy bus 58 access to centre. Well organised and very friendly staff. After a long day exploring Bilbao and the Guggenheim museum we returned on the bus and ordered an UberEats Indian meal delivery from Indian Town too and they delivered to this location. Brilliant and convenient.
17633,1928107,2,Zoran2021travel,29/05/2022,"The view is pretty much everything... No showers, no washrooms, how does this differ from a ""normal parking lot""? At least the price is ok."
17633,1925051,5,oliviavan8892,28/05/2022,Incredible view with friendly staff. They get super busy with the arriving boats to Ireland and the UK so be patient and compassionate with them. Bookings essential to guarantee a spot.
17633,1925049,4,cecea,28/05/2022,"The place deserves, € 18 all inclusive, the bathroom key system is cumbersome, you have to ask for it and then bring it back. To go to the city in front of the 58 passes to and from the center, very convenient."
17633,1922558,2,didougisou,27/05/2022,"It seemed good indeed, but they had 2 places left and it was reservations..!! It seemed, however, that there were more left! It's impossible to know if the next day, there are available, suddenly, Bilbao it will be for another time, despite the glowing comments, parking there does not seem so simple. In front of us Spaniards wishing to know the availability the next day and the same!"
17633,1916100,3,Axmoe,25/05/2022,"Everything has already been described: great view, a lot of patience from the staff, loud, constantly barking dogs at the farm above the square, goats with jingling bells and otherwise: great starting point for discovering Bilbao. The bus makes it possible."
17633,1910619,4,Polux64,23/05/2022,"Nice view, correct price with services except the shower. Good for visiting Bilbao. Nice staff a bit speedy.. Recommended for the city."
17633,1906252,4,hexen_haus,22/05/2022,Great for exploring the city. There is someone from reception on site 24 hours a day. Parking lot opposite has height restrictions (1.95m) and illegal overnight stays are controlled by local police. 1 star deduction for the partly unfriendly staff and the mass processing. Otherwise we would go back to the place. Great city
17633,1905471,4,JanyPit,21/05/2022,"Perfect for what it is: motorhome area to visit Bilbao. 15 euros per vehicle. Good atmosphere. Close staff. Very careful, including the bathroom, one only for men and one only for women, which also open with a key that you have to take at reception and return it after use...completely inoperative. The bus picks you up at the door of the area and leaves you in the old town in 20 min. I would return"
17633,1905271,5,BerndRudde,21/05/2022,"Simply great! Great views of Bilbao, quiet, toilet, bus to town! What more do you want! 10 out of 10!"
17633,1905021,5,mike41,21/05/2022,Very calm place. Spacious location. What's weird is finding caravans.
17633,1901237,4,ncl2020,19/05/2022,"Beautifully located terraced space outside Bilbao. Reservations definitely make sense in the high season. You will be sent back a PDF form that you have to fill out. From the terminus of line 58 in Bilbao you can take the tram in 5 stops to the Guggenheim Museum. Alternatively, about 40 minutes on foot through the old town."
17633,1898900,5,13Miranbeou,18/05/2022,", magnificent view on the shaded platform, flat location is vast, I recommend"
17633,1898422,2,skurl,18/05/2022,"Partly narrow places. At night stench and barking dogs. We didn't sleep well. You always have to get the toilet key from reception, a numerical code would be better.."
17633,1891497,4,Englandscamper,15/05/2022,"Stunning views over Bilbao - recommend booking in advance as does get full quick! We were also given a great front row spot because we booked. There are toilets that you can use til 11pm, electricity, water and waste. For showers we went to their hostel 5 min drive down the road. We got the bus into the centre which was €1.35 each way."
17633,1889445,5,mulasca,14/05/2022,"Excellent rest area, large partially shaded pitches. Staff courteous and helpful. C \ S included. 15 euros. 8 euros with uber for the city center."
17633,1888543,1,agnes2022,14/05/2022,"We arrived a bit late due to some traffic. We met unfriendly staff, even that we could see free spots we where told that the sight was full. So we had to drive on. The one star is for the view."
17633,1888135,3,kajlwr,13/05/2022,"Book 48 hours before your stay, or arrive before mid afternoon. Staff friendly and helpful but very busy, decent pitches and great view. Total pain to have to collect the key from the office to use the toilet. There is only one member of staff on duty and they are often on site and lock the office. Good bus route to Bilbao. They only allow 2 nights max; you have to check in again for a 2nd night."
17633,1881209,5,cazayousNathalie,10/05/2022,"Very good reception, location with superb view. Bus 58 to visit the city."
17633,1874808,5,Leslobs3,07/05/2022,"Beautiful area with magnificent views of Bilbao, surrounded by large green areas with cows, horses, goats. Well located for visiting Bilbao and its museum, by taking the bus. Very nice home. We will return"
17633,1870320,5,louisa1912,04/05/2022,magnificent area as much as the view of the city... bus or other compulsory means to go down to town because of the authors. very pleasant staff. electric terminal plus water practically at each location. very pleasant
17633,1865184,5,wario46,02/05/2022,good place to get to know Bilbao. bus next door that in 10 minutes you are in the center and spectacular views highly recommended
17633,1857196,4,franckstephanie,28/04/2022,All is said in previous reviews but it's all true! Really great area. I recommend !! Frank.
17633,1855532,3,ParkPriscilla,27/04/2022,"All really good. Location, cleanliness, infrastructure, etc. However, it is incomprehensible that the toilets are not available at night. Likewise the complicated key handling. Please think again!"
17633,1845840,5,TheGroody,22/04/2022,Great views and a 45 minute walk down the hill into town. Bus 58 brings you back up. Check in took ages so be prepared to que.
17633,1838503,5,hilger,19/04/2022,"I think the best pitch in Bilbao with a great view of the city. Great bus connection to get to the center, bread service."
17633,1838201,1,Carles84,19/04/2022,"Nefarious entrance staff, we arrived at 10:00 p.m. with a small child and when asked if they had a place, their response was: have you not seen the sign or what??? We made about 10 calls before going and none had an answer. When arriving and asking for another nearby place, his answer was also not appropriate for someone who works in customer service."
17633,1828770,4,milleralabama,16/04/2022,"Great area to visit Bilbao, very good views. with the bus stop next door and very cordial treatment. if I return to Bilbao I repeat area"
17633,1828157,4,Dakar755,16/04/2022,Excellent pitch for visiting Bilbao. Be sure to reserve in advance as it is very busy. Infrastructure in best condition. Bus to the center of Bilbao until around 23:00. quiet at night. We recommend.
17633,1821846,5,lechauve64,14/04/2022,"Magnificent view of Bilbao, friendly receptionist. 15 € water, electricity drain included. Deposit of bread. Bus 58 at the foot of the air that takes you to town"
17633,1819252,4,tobiandlaura,13/04/2022,We paid 30€ for 2 people for 2 nights. The toilets were ok but you had to go to reception to get a key. Wifi is also only available at the reception which is a bit impractical. At night some dogs barked which was a bit annoying. Definitely the best place to visit Bilbao.
17633,1817930,4,heribrecht,12/04/2022,"The place is heavily frequented. To be sure of a place, you should make a reservation."
17633,1817898,4,Atlantikkueste,12/04/2022,"Awesome view of Bilbao, fair price €15 pd for only a toilet house with a key at the reception. Water and electricity on site including service water/camping toilet disposal possible. Ideal bus connection to the center with line 58 for €1.35 per person If the 200m away Cervecera is open, it's great."
17633,1815583,5,chausson33,11/04/2022,What to say exceptional view of the city friendly welcoming staff ... for 15 euros including elec and services .... bus 58 to get to town .... perfect I recommend
17633,1812849,5,NinaLuz,10/04/2022,"Beautiful place, very nice reception. Safe and good to visit the city. So perfect. But the toilets can only be visited with a key, which you have to get at the reception 0700-2300. And you can use the showers in the hostel downstairs within a certain time. Walk very far! That disappointed me. Dog Friendly!"
17633,1811710,5,ourworldheritage,09/04/2022,"Easy to reach from the highway, spectacular view over Bilbao. Toilets are super clean, the two ladies managing the place are really friendly and give out a lot of information about the city. Bus stop nearby, very easy to access the city."
17633,1810081,5,karinafred,08/04/2022,"Very nice air with nice view of Bilbao. Hot bread in the morning at 1 euro if you book. Very nice staff. Ideal for a 48-hour break, the maximum allowed."
17633,1805452,5,Seb17001,03/04/2022,Incredible view of Bilbao and bus in front direct to the old town. Plenty of places this season. Be careful in the mud when it rains but there is no risk of getting bogged down.
17633,1805040,3,sinenomen,03/04/2022,good choice for visiting Bilbao. Check-in fast and uncomplicated. no showers and the toilet key always has to be picked up from reception which was annoying. good bus connection to the city without changing trains. maximum two nights allowed.
17633,1802716,5,Medley,01/04/2022,"Impeccable area, unobstructed view of Bilbao. Water and electricity on the site in the fixed price. 2 nights maximum, the second to be confirmed before 12 noon. Bus 58 for Bilbao, all information at reception."
17633,1801638,5,park4nightAP,31/03/2022,Superb view of the city of Bilbao. Clean and quiet parking area. Bus 58 to get to the old town is impeccable.
17633,1796101,4,Samhotrod,26/03/2022,"A good place to see the city. The bus stop is directly on site. Very friendly employees. The only flaw: for people without a toilet in the camper, there are only 2 on site, which are only open from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. We were very satisfied!"
17633,1792500,4,JessDen,23/03/2022,"Good place to visit the city of Bilbao. Bus line 58 goes to the city for €1.35 per person. Great view, all pitches with electricity. Toilets available, key must be picked up at the reception. No showers available."
17633,1787331,2,Citijo,19/03/2022,"Well maintained area, a little expensive because a toilet and you have to ask for the key at reception, 15€ with electricity plus 7.40€ bus for two people for me it is a closed car park."
17633,1786875,5,sergicanadell,18/03/2022,Spectacular area of Bilbao with incredible views of the city. €15 per day with all services. Bus stop 1 minute from the area ay qe take the 58. Very friendly at reception. See her in: VETTA FAMILY
17633,1779029,1,bestinima,10/03/2022,"You must return before 12 if you wish to extend a night. (We had booked a hotel in the center so that we didn't have to travel this route.) When the stay is extended to the second night, all the data will be recorded again. Going to the toilet is only possible after picking up the key. All in all too bureaucratic and inflexible. But what can you do...?"
17633,1778608,1,MartinCalvo,09/03/2022,Very good area at the height of the city with spectacular views. Far away with good TP connection.
17633,1777530,5,ThierryDesombre,08/03/2022,"An extraordinary view of the city if you go down to visit Bilbao by bike, plan an electric one because the ascent is steep Clean area without shower"
17633,1770848,4,Madbird,02/03/2022,"Very good area, well-kept and with a very nice staff. Beautiful views of Bilbao. To go to Bilbao you have to take bus 58, it is the only one but it costs €1.35 one way and the same amount for the return, a concert with the transport company would be great, so that the price of the area would be more adjusted. I would go back."
17633,1768240,5,yunakira,27/02/2022,"Spectacular views, quiet place with all services. You can be in the Area for a maximum of two days. Good location 20 minutes from downtown by motorcycle. We arrived at noon and next to the park we discovered by chance a very nice place to eat Cervecera Cobetas, recommended without a doubt."
17633,1759019,5,CARPAT,18/02/2022,"Very good place and almost the only one to visit Bilbao and very easy with the buses (be careful, no dogs on the buses) and possibility of hiking, the city could give the possibility of staying 72 hours would be a plus, internet at the reception,"
17633,1754954,5,Millaneando,13/02/2022,"Good views, absolutely quiet, the girl who attended us was a charm, by bus in a few minutes you are in the center. Good area to stay for one or two days since it costs €15 per day."
17633,1752742,5,MAGSII,11/02/2022,"As other guests have said. Nice reception, great view and a very clean place. Small disadvantage: maximum two nights. Value for money is top at €15.00. We can only recommend the place."

17633,1745984,4,mariececile94,02/02/2022,"very nice view of Bilbao, we were only 4 or 5 motorhomes, too bad we have to ask for the key at reception for the toilets, very restrictive and we did not use them, 15 euros just for water and electricity a bit expensive but it is the price of tranquility and we appreciated, bus 58 very convenient to visit Bilbao"
17633,1745690,5,HaMoSprinterVan,01/02/2022,"Guarded, great view over the city, you have everything you need, just no showers. Perfect for a trip to the city - walked the way down AND up. It was exhausting, but it was at least as much fun - the staircase district in Hamburg is a sh… compared to that"
17633,1745262,4,FranziBader,31/01/2022,"Super parking space with a large, adjoining park for sports or walking the dog. Attention: The bus into the city is not allowed for dogs. You can use the Bilbao Hostel to take a shower, it costs €4.50. Extremely expensive. If you come in the morning you can still have breakfast for the same money."
17633,1742697,5,Boults,28/01/2022,"Great location with stunning view of the city particularly at night. However you are still quite a way out of the city. We used the no 58 bus which was cheap as chips and ok until about 10 pm. 
Services good with water and EHU on the pitch.
Road to the campsite and a pitch at the front is not for the faint hearted with a fear of heights!
Would recommend"
17633,1741932,5,plukkieb,26/01/2022,Very nice place! Beautiful view over Bilbao. CP very neat and equipped with all facilities. There friendly staff. The bus stops (almost) in front of the door and in 20 minutes you are in the center. Cost for overnight stay eur 15 (incl electricity)
17633,1741674,4,sirralle,26/01/2022,Nice place with the most beautiful view .. the toilets are unfortunately only open when you pick up a key in the office ..

17633,1730473,5,Sammy.jun,09/01/2022,"Parking space above Bilbao. Very nice sight of the city. Very nice reception. It is advantageous if you speak Spanish. I got it done in broken English on both sides. There is a nearby bus stop that leaves the 58s every 30 minutes. And while you're here, you should also take a look at the city. It's worth it.

17633,1703924,2,carlasp,05/12/2021,"Cheap and with good views of Bilbao. Accessible by bus. For the rest, we did not like it, it is an area with a lot of wind and our van moved a lot at night. They only have a men's bathroom and a women's bathroom, and to use them you have to ask for the key at reception. Also they don't have showers. We would not repeat."
17633,1703399,4,AnnabelleD,05/12/2021,The view over Bilbao is just Wow! 15 € water electricity. The only negative point is that you have to ask for the keys to go to the toilet ... Significant wind resistance in the seats above.
17633,1703046,5,Hardy59,04/12/2021,"Wow! The view over Bilbao justifies the 15 €! Also very good for walkers. To the Guggenheim, a 50-minute walk along the river. Very nice. Then back to the CC and enjoy the view with a wine!"

17633,1672743,2,lagardeelodie,01/11/2021,"Clean area, very nice view, well located with bus to the city, fair price. Only problem, beware the showers are not on site and 4.50 € / person for 1 night you can do without. the toilets are closed at night from 11 pm to 8 am and during the day they must be collected from the difficult reception when it is urgent with children. For me this area is not suitable for the Van."

17633,1656937,5,distlerei,22/10/2021,There couldn't be a nicer parking space in the immediate vicinity of a big city :)) And then end the evening with a glass of wine and a view of the illuminated city under the full moon - what more does the camper's heart need? An absolutely quiet night and of course there was that at this place too :)

What I can't explain is how having only one bathroom they have it locked up and the key is not given to you after 11 pm (although there is someone at the reception 24/24. I don't understand it. After 11 pm you can't use it. the bathroom ... otherwise all good."
17633,1643304,5,hexle78,13/10/2021,Great place! Sufficiently large plots. Great for exploring the city with e-bikes. Friendly welcome. Quite quiet at night for the proximity of the big city. We recommend!
17633,1641953,4,wimwilting,13/10/2021,Beautiful panorama from the motorhome over Bilbao. You can easily take the bus which is 200m in front of the motorhome for 1.35 € per person to the city one way. From no 20 min. to Guchenheim Museum By bike it becomes a challenge. Key to toilet via the reception. Quiet neat motorhome. There are no showers and toilet is closed at night hence 4 points.
17633,1641520,5,parkviper,12/10/2021,"Top pitch! Staff very nice, 15 euros per night, electricity and water included. By bus in the city, perfect for visiting Bilbao city. Clean and calm."
17633,1638205,5,roseroma,11/10/2021,My favorite stop during the 10 days that we have traveled through Navarra and the Basque Country! Impressive views and the guy at the reception has explained us how to visit the center. Bus almost at the door. Only downside ... quite muddy on the plots.
17633,1633694,5,marcela0108,08/10/2021,Excellent spot!! great view. all services for $15.00. bus less than 5 min walk in 30 mins you're in town for 1.35....great customer service. very informative if ever in the area will definitely come back.
17633,1632003,3,flo1310,07/10/2021,"The view from the pitch is great. The bus is a great way to get into town. There are toilets but no showers. At night, however, the toilets are locked and the groundskeeper is not very cooperative. This service is 15 € too expensive."
17633,1622505,5,victoriapaton92,02/10/2021,"The truth is that one of the best places in Bilbao! IMPRESSIVE views of Bilbao, and a quiet, respectful place, and with all services. The only thing would be missing showers. For everything else, you have water, electricity, to empty waters, sinks. Highly recommended !!!!"
17633,1621699,5,Monne77,02/10/2021,"Highly recommended! beautiful rest area, quiet, safe, surrounded by greenery. breathtaking panorama. the city can be easily reached by bus nr 58 or by bike (electric for the ascent to return)"
17633,1620233,1,pfnbilb98,01/10/2021,"Our vehicle was apparently ""too small"" for the parking space and we had to stand in the outdoor parking lot in front of the parking space. There it was broken into (during the day, on the busy road) & robbed! When asked whether the guard could call the police, he was absolutely not cooperative because it was probably none of his business. All very suspicious, I would definitely not recommend it!"
17633,1616964,4,calimeric,29/09/2021,Super high location in Bilbao Nice and friendly city to visit (old town) The reception staff are very friendly and provide good advice I recommend as a stopover.

17633,1604631,4,Frida19,24/09/2021,"Simple pitch with a view of Bilbao. 15 Eur per night for a motorhome with electricity (there is no without electricity). Water right on the spot. Disposal gray and black. Plots comfortably large. No shower. WiFi ONLY works directly at the reception. No more WiFi reception at the place! 3 toilets (women, men, disabled people). You can only stay for a maximum of 48 hours (COVID?)"
17633,1600193,4,park4night2698,22/09/2021,"Great parking space for a city trip. The mobile home is safe (with a good view) and you can take a bus directly to the city center (very cheap). Price for motorhome / 2 adults / electricity / 1 night: 15 €. However, the sanitary facilities are not so great."
17633,1593939,4,Jennygoodey,20/09/2021,"Great night stop, only 1 ladies and 1 men's toilet up 2 flights of stairs , no showers, great views of Bilbao city, great park for picnics and walks"
17633,1589288,1,Beppo2016,18/09/2021,"It would be a great place with a great view if it weren't for the unfriendly groundskeeper. Although there were enough free places, we were simply ignored, why, that did not open up to us. We drove again disappointed, so we can only give one star."

17633,1588321,4,alecolaf,18/09/2021,"Spectacular view, spacious pitches, electricity and water in each pitch, a man and a woman bathroom, the only major flaw is the absence of showers. By bike (preferably electric), do not follow maps but at the exit turn left and then at the first fork on the right, passing in front of a bus stop, you will take a nice road that leads almost to the Guggenheim Museum."
17633,1587309,5,MartaPou,17/09/2021,"A 10 in all aspects ... the location, the views, the services, the transport until the center of the city .... The wide plots and without limitation neither of height nor of length"
17633,1587020,3,remy66,17/09/2021,"An area with services and an extraordinary view, of course, but with a welcome worthy of the Stalinist era. We do not say hello, we hardly speak and we spend 10 minutes to register each arrival by typing with 2 fingers ALL the information on the identity card (while you are paying) and to exit you have to ask 2 times even if we saw you!"
17633,1585148,5,domigranier,17/09/2021,"An area as we like them with large, clean, quiet pitches at a reasonable price and, as a bonus, a breathtaking view of Bilbao day and night. Access by bus (58) at the foot of the area. People from the south"
17633,1584758,5,bikefire,16/09/2021,"Area of 5 per location, services, comfort, attention ... Water and electricity in each plot and large to take out an awning, table, chairs ... It must be taken into account that to visit Bilbao it is advisable to use public transport, since the area is up and there is a certain distance plus the unevenness."

Too bad there are only toilets (get key at the entrance). For 1.35 one-way bus no. 58. If you stay longer, buy a Bilbo pass for € 3 (also valid for 2 people!) and load it up (5 or 10 euros). Your Bilbo pass gives a discount of 40 to 50 % on all types of transport in Bilbao."
17633,1568067,5,Ametllers,11/09/2021,Great area to visit the city. Spacious places with electricity and water each square. Bus 58 takes you down and up from the center. Be careful if you have big dogs ... they can't get on the bus. Our dog stayed in the motorhome (if it is a hot day they have a hard time).
17633,1567872,5,sergioeli,11/09/2021,It seems far but it has a bus stop next to it and it passes every 20 minutes and after so much walking it is nice to have dinner while you see Bilbao at night. Perfect
17633,1567423,5,felicia96,11/09/2021,"Perfect! Very friendly reception guy, worth € 15, we asked him if we could stay longer and there was no problem.

17633,1564354,4,mitodes,10/09/2021,"It is an area with spectacular views and very complete services. We knew it from other stays, but this time we couldn't park because it was full, as we were told at 18:30 it was already closed (one working day in low season, September 9!). The esplanade in front, which served as a “spillway”, continues with a 1.90m barrier."
17633,1557203,4,ivi1987,07/09/2021,"Good place to spend the night. Price € 15 per day, the price includes parking, electricity, recharging water and emptying sewage.

At around 7:00 pm they have closed the doors and have not let anyone else in (complete!) Bus 58 goes directly to the center (as you get off the parking lot, the big stop that curves to the right)"
17633,1540139,4,RebePierre,02/09/2021,"Very calm. we spent one night and rested. For, 15 euros it is worth not getting into the traffic and center of Bilbao. 20 minutes by bus from the center. the only bad thing is the reception worker, not very communicative and very slow."
17633,1535767,4,buenes,31/08/2021,"Great Area ... must improve the treatment in reception, showers and toilet ... The views are great ...!"

If you want to reserve, you cannot locate them by tf. and when you arrive if they have trouble at the reception even if you see a lot of free places they tell you that they are reserved. The reception system is very archaic. It's a shame because the area is wonderful."

17633,1499564,4,Manu1978,22/08/2021,"Excellent location with a panoramic view, do not call because either they do not answer or they tell you that there is no place but if you arrive between 10 and 11 you will find a place for sure. Only Spanish is spoken at the reception; they are quick but effective. Excellent connections with bus 58 which passes a few meters but line 28 a little below (you can reach it by stairs) is even more frequent"
17633,1499094,5,centrodelsur,22/08/2021,"Excellent area. Bus almost at the door. The management is a bit chaotic but there are many of us and we are very impatient. Thanks Bilbao, even at the top of a hill and far from the whole place is great."
17633,1496614,2,Kirstenundtorsten,22/08/2021,"Very unfriendly reception, staff only speaks Spanish, space is allocated, requests are not taken into account. The view of Bilbao is fantastic, unfortunately we were assigned a seat in the back row without a view, although some front seats were still free in the evening."
17633,1494367,3,Boalpe,21/08/2021,"Spectacular views. The zone is assigned to you. We were lucky and we were very well located, although I don't think there was a bad one. The bad thing about the place is that it has a toilet, which is not cleaned continuously. You have the bus practically at the door and it leaves you directly in the historic center and the journey takes about 25 min."
17633,1486537,4,perf89,20/08/2021,"Area with good views and good services but the staff is not very good. They tell you that everything is complete when it is not, you have to wait for them to check it because they go easy."
17633,1480622,3,Jorg3Arancon,19/08/2021,"The area is good, large grass squares, the horrible management, the phone is not taken, we managed to reserve via email, when we arrived in line (about 30 'we were until they attended us, there was only 3 AC in front ...), line to go out, you cannot pay at once, you have to pay for the night every day, lockable bathrooms to request, the area is fine but the reservation, entry and exit system should be greatly improved"
17633,1479952,1,mixquel,19/08/2021,"3 days after trying to contact them to find out if they had places available and we are still waiting for a response. Several WhatsApp, more than 10 calls and no answer. We went to the Area and it was full, so we went to the Zamudio Area for free and from 10. All services free, 100m from the train stop that leaves you in the center of Bilbao."
17633,1477370,1,joanicoAC,18/08/2021,"We are passing by, we needed to empty and we went to the area expressly and we were told that only those with a Vizcaya traffic permit can empty it."
17633,1477280,3,DeeKwa,18/08/2021,Good place to visit Bilbao. Because Spanish people are loud until late don t count on sleep early. Why not a higher rate? The toilets are closed from 24-07 hrs? So if you don t have a camper with chem toilet you will burst or make the campsite dirty. Just open the toilets and we can rate 5 out of 5!
17633,1463590,4,Lunila,15/08/2021,"The area is fine, the reservation system a bit messy, as we had confirmation by email and when we arrived nothing was known about our reservation. In the end they let us enter the last free square. Lockable services provided at reception. The breathtaking views of Bilbao, you can go by bus."
17633,1461116,2,markiemarkE14,15/08/2021,"It has an amazing view, Organisation was a shambles. We booked on line and received an confirmation email. When we arrived at 6pm it was full.  We waited 2 hours in adjacent public car park (height 1.95) where we could have stayed for free. Only 1 m/f toilet and you have to get key from reception (closes at 2200). They offer showers at the hostel (who run the site), but that is 15 min walk!"
17633,1457746,1,prietoyves,14/08/2021,"Extraordinary view of Bilbao, perfect area for visiting the city, the bus stop is a few meters away. staff present from 8 am to 11 pm, toilets and showers, we had paid 15 euros for the night."
17633,1457012,5,franblasco,14/08/2021,"Spectacular area with incredible views, good staff treatment and the correct facilities. Very close bus stop that leaves you right in the old part of the city. We will repeat for sure."

17633,1451806,4,pandorayprome,13/08/2021,"Do not waste time in other points, it has a bus stop 5 minutes away, it is not expensive, unbeatable views. I do not put 5 because there is only one bathroom (1 toilet and 1 sink) for men and one for women and the showers cost 4.5"
17633,1449814,5,mazpop,13/08/2021,"I confirm everything. I would add, for those who travel by bike, they need either an e-bike or a physicist like Pantani in its best days. Too much difference in altitude for us humans."
17633,1449604,2,pid26,13/08/2021,"Unfortunately, very, very unfriendly and inflexible people. The staff is more reminiscent of unmotivated parking attendants. When called, they simply hung up during the conversation. The tone is just disgusting. Not recommended, even if the view is outstanding."
17633,1448542,4,turquoisevan,13/08/2021,"The area is very good. It has good views of the city and a bus stop at the door, with quite large pitches although some without shade. It has a bathroom and to fill and empty waters. For € 4.5 more, you can shower at the hostel (10 'walk). The staff is not friendly at all, very poorly organized to enter and a long waiting time. They may tell you that there is no place and there is."
17633,1445506,3,Rosemerschnake,12/08/2021,"I could have put 5 like almost everyone, but no! A single person at the reception with 0 tension (39 minutes of waiting) and unwillingness because it is impossible to be side by side at 2 C. Because when one floor of the area is only full. half. At 3.10 p.m. he closes the gate and displays full, 5 places next to us remain free."

17633,1442543,5,bienmesabe,12/08/2021,"Extraordinary space to replenish and rest, they have a toilet, they do not have a shower, it is necessary to reserve (at least in August) 20 minutes from the center of Bilbao by bus (stop 100 m from the area) wonderful views of Bilbao (when booking you must request space with views :-))"
17633,1438110,4,hedwigr,11/08/2021,"Arrived on a weekday at 1 pm without reservation and still room. Pos: spacious pitches, nice view (on ugly city), . Negative: far from old town and guggenheim (5km), not really safe for cyclists in the city (little bike paths)"
17633,1433162,3,indiana65,10/08/2021,Good site and very cool views ... but the receptionists have the medal of sympathy for saying that they are unable to carry out any procedure other than charging ... I asked for a change of place for mobility and did not want when there was room to spare. ...

17633,1426275,1,calmatotal,08/08/2021,"They didn't pick up the phone to make sure they had places. When we did not get an answer, we went up and in very bad manners, he told us that they had no places. Which was not true, as it was visible to the naked eye that there were free places"
17633,1421005,5,JoseMiguelbetoret,08/08/2021,"Very good area. It is at the top of the mountain, with curves, but the access road has 2 lanes (the bus circulates perfectly). It has water and electricity in all the plots. € 15 per night. It is always full, book before. many caravans have been left out"
17633,1420926,4,Vido,08/08/2021,"Great area, with unbeatable views of the city. With public transport to the old town"

17633,1416787,5,FAMILLEALLAIN53,07/08/2021,Great view. Large pitches with water and electricity connections. Quiet for the night. Connection with the city center by bus 58 (one bus every 30 minutes - allow a good half an hour to reach Punte del Arenal) Toilets available but not used. Parking lot filled up very early despite the large number of spaces (we took one of the last available at 1pm) Top for € 15 a night.
17633,1415191,5,MymyDag,06/08/2021,"Nice view, good quality services. everything is clean and you are well received. go there with your eyes closed, you will not regret your 15 € (in cash). advice, contact them to book a little in advance: max 2 nights, from noon to noon"
17633,1413650,4,Reiseeuphorie,06/08/2021,A spontaneous overnight stay without a reservation was possible. We felt very safe and the place is very suitable for a city tour of Bilbao. Bus 58 currently runs every 30 minutes in the immediate vicinity of Platz directly to the city center. WiFi only works at the front desk. For the toilet you have to get the key at the reception.
17633,1413602,5,Primynet,06/08/2021,"Spectacular views, very close to Bilbao scepter, a bus brings you closer for less than € 2 and in less than 15m. There is also a huge park next door, perfect for letting the dogs go. Of course, to get a place you have to go in the morning or make a reservation, because if you can't, you can stay out. Next to it there is a free parking but the maximum height is 1.95."
17633,1412225,5,Eserrant,06/08/2021,"Beautiful views, very good facilities, a lot of tranquility. The price, 15 euros, is adequate for what they offer. Visiting the center of Bilbao is very easy from there, bus 58 and you get off at the last stop, which leaves you at the Ribera market. We arrived on a Thursday morning, with no capacity problems. On Friday at 10.00 when we left there was already a queue to get in. Busy weekend."
17633,1410881,4,Black_Mountain,05/08/2021,"In very crowded August, it is advisable to reserve, we did not do it and we entered with a miracle. Friendly staff but a bit slow in administrative management. Restaurant nearby to eat something, no noise, you can take out an awning and bbq."
17633,1406207,1,alvanee,04/08/2021,"We called in the morning to see if there was room to spend the night, they asked us what time we would arrive, we told them that at 6:00 p.m. and they told us that they reserved a place for us. We got there at 6pm and the staff don't know anything about the reservation and also say they never make reservations. We verified that we had called the correct phone number and that is when they call us liars. Treatment of the staff very bad."

17633,1387958,4,Depaula,31/07/2021,Perfect place to visit Bilbao. Bus to the center every 20 'on business days and every half hour on holidays. The stop 200 m. The best… the views of Bilbao.
17633,1383056,4,Kjoeps,30/07/2021,Nice place but don't go near the barrier. for unknown reasons there are always people who leave their engine running for fifteen minutes when they are waiting in front of the barrier and their wife is registering at the reception.
17633,1382620,4,JoseCanBoada,30/07/2021,"We have spent the night from June 29 to 30. There is no control at night, people talking loudly at midnight and children playing soccer. Regrettable"

17633,1347857,4,Fabico44,21/07/2021,Very nice view over Bilbao. Pitches on grass with water and electricity Very quiet. Access to the center of Bilbao by bus 58 in about 30 minutes. Return by taxi for 12 € last bus 10:30 pm a bit tight for a Spanish evening. To recommend.
17633,1334614,4,aldipa,17/07/2021,"Nothing to say, the squares are quite flat, with a light socket at the foot of the plot. Uuff amazing views of BILBAO, a bit far from the center but the bus line runs next door. The downloads and uploads very well with 5 downloads for if people move. Grass floor with net so you don't skid."
17633,1319016,4,Eduito,13/07/2021,The place is comfortable and has magnificent views of Bilbao. The only but is having to ask for the keys to the toilet at home. It is well connected to the center. Bus 58 is one step away.
17633,1314026,1,tothevanandback,11/07/2021,"It is true that the views are extraordinary and it is a quiet, pleasant and safe place to spend the night, however, the treatment of the staff is disastrous, very unpleasant! They didn't want to let us sleep with our reservation because it was a small van! of course we finally got it also they don't let you leave with your home vehicle while you're parked there !! you have to go by bus"
17633,1310593,3,nurisnuris,10/07/2021,"The area is spacious and pleasant, it has wonderful views of the city. We slept there very comfortably if it weren't for the fact that at 7.30 they started mowing the lawn and woke us up. Also the woman at the reception treated us as if we bothered her for checking in, definitely very unprofessional. Even so, we would repeat because the area is worth more than the lack of professionalism of its workers."
17633,1302592,2,vivable,07/07/2021,"Good place to visit the city. However, check in really slowly about 40 minutes waiting time for 3 campers. The night was rather modest because the whole place was lit almost with floodlights and in the morning the lawn was mowed to think about sleep no more."
17633,1301761,4,infante46,06/07/2021,"In general it is a good area, grass in nice plots, nice views, a bit off the beaten path but bus 58 next door. The welcome was not very warm but hey, it is not something decisive. I recommend it"
17633,1295872,1,travelandshare,04/07/2021,"I don't recommend it to anyone!  they are deceitful, they promised us a place and once we had paid for the place, he said he was not available and he did not return our money!  we left with a loss of 15 euros and no place to stay.  We called the police who told us they couldn't do anything! Revolting!  I'll never go near that place again"
17633,1285976,5,jaraeli19,29/06/2021,"Area with spectacular views of Bilbao, especially at dusk. Very friendly and attentive staff, level pitches with electricity and water connections (important to have a three-pin plug adapter, although they will leave it for you at reception x 20 euros deposit). Bus line (58) 100 meters to go downtown. Highly recommended"
17633,1282185,4,NilsausdemNorden,27/06/2021,"We were passing through here to enjoy the city. Yes, the sanitary facilities are open to a limited extent, but for the price a guarded area with a great view of the city. The staff was very friendly. There is a bus into town but we treated ourselves to a taxi / Uber for about 10 euros each. Should we stop again with the van at Bilbao we will know where we are"
17633,1276406,4,Ruud60,25/06/2021,"Fantastic view, arrived late at 17.15 payed one day 15 euro incl 230v, departure time next day before 17.15, so you have all day to visit Bilbao"
17633,1270808,1,SilverNelly,22/06/2021,"To start with something positive; the view is amazing! 
unfortunately I can not say the same about the staff. We arrived 5 min after closing and they were not able to check us in. She did leave the gate open though so luckily we could park our camper for the night. The toilet is only accessible during opening hours of the reception, and not even that because at 4.30 the guy already said it was cleaned so we couldn’t use it anymore. And that while he was very persuasive about the opening hours of the reception. As said, the view is great and the bus connection to the city as well. But you’re basically paying for an expensive parking lot with electricity."
17633,1270620,1,RosanneSchellekens,22/06/2021,Would not recommend!!! extremely unfriendly staff. dont expect more than just a very expensive parking lot (with a nice view). they open and close the entrance bar and the toilets at any time they want (even though they say its from 9.00 until 17.00) and if you have questions about anything they only say that 'they cannot help you because of the boss'.
17633,1260038,5,goof03wx,17/06/2021,"This place is amazing overview of the city  beautiful,
down to the city bus 58 every 20 mins and it's always on time
the staff on site are 
amazing 
friendly and so so helpful thanks to them.
I will return here 20 mins from the port and Safe
there's a park and it's wonderful
able to walk around if you have a dog he/she will love it
over all I'll give this place  10 out of 10"
17633,1251717,4,Alberto5,13/06/2021,Nice and quiet place but to enter the bathroom you have to ask for the key and on Sunday they have missed the schedule. at 9 o'clock the toilets are still closed when they had to be open at 8 o'clock.
17633,1245751,4,GuilleyNatalia,09/06/2021,"Spectacular views over Bilbao. Very safe and clean area. € 15 per day including electricity, water and disposal of gray and black water. After 5:00 p.m., the gatehouse is closed, enter the opposite lane and the next day you can pay. Bus stop 58 at 400 meters approx. that will take you downtown for € 1.35 / pers. in 30 '. Food store (LOLA) at 800m approx."
17633,1245723,2,pasquib,09/06/2021,Impossible internet connection. thus limiting your consultations for mobility. toilets closed at 5pm. i more. breathtaking views over Bilbo.

17633,1230820,4,JasminMeier,01/06/2021,"Great view of the city. In 50 minutes in the Guggenheim Museum, in 40 minutes in the center of Moyua Plaza on foot. The best thing to do is to take the stairs through the residential area, immediately to the left of the first bus stop, down into the city. Comfortable, spacious V / E. Taxi one way € 9.00"
17633,1224278,4,lkwlkwlkw,29/05/2021,"To be used as a service stop and safe place to visit Bilbao. No luxuries. For the cost you would usually expect showers and more efficient facilities (there is 1 bathroom men/1 women and to use you need to get a key from the reception which isn’t open 24/7). However given the many comments we saw regarding free spots in Bilbao that had been broken into, 15 euros felt fine for peace of mind. Bus goes from down the road (the one on the opposite side of the road not the first you come to when walking down) and takes about 15 mins."

17633,1203043,4,JulenHDM,16/05/2021,The area of 10 except for the issue of the bathrooms. They told us what time they closed. We went 45 min before closing them and they told us that since they had just been cleaned they would not open them until the next day ... anyway ... Very good views of Greater Bilbao
17633,1193618,5,thomassooon,12/05/2021,"Very nice view, especially at night. Currently absolutely empty because of Corona. I came late in the evening and the gate was closed, but then you can drive up the exit in the opposite direction! The next day I was able to pay. There is water, water disposal, electricity and toilets."

The staff was okay, but we had to ask for all information individually (bus, breakfast, toilets, etc.). There is electricity and water directly on the pitch."

17633,1114959,4,paulovelez,13/11/2020,Really good place. I paied 15e for my mobile home and 2 people. The view is stunning! We can see At. Bilbao stadium and all the city. really nice and polite workers. To be 5 stars its just missing showers.
17633,1109737,2,francou46,30/10/2020,"We did not have the pleasure of arriving at this area, so be careful of the road you take. One of our biggest scares, the road climbed very very hard and we had to go back down about 200m to be able to turn around, luckily helped by locals. So we fled Bilbao."
17633,1109052,4,manshivas,29/10/2020,"A bit pricey, but wonderful view of the city. Rather large pitches. Electricity and water supply for each place, clean and functional emptying area. Showers, and a bus stop right next door to go down to town."

17633,1092765,5,corbacho1,13/10/2020,Great clean and comfortable place do not forget the blue 16 amp plug if they do not sell them for € 20 the only inconvenient thing that there are no showers and that the services are closed from 23 to 8
17633,1086821,4,lizw58,09/10/2020,"Lovely clean site and fantastic city views, bit of an uphill drive but no problem for smallish van & trailer. Some noise from city below but not bad. Easy 30 min drive to ferry. Small shop selling basic stuff, pizza, beer, wine. Worth the  15€"
17633,1070908,5,JaviImbernon,26/09/2020,"The best RV park we've ever been to. Well maintained, with all the services and a super friendly and attentive staff. Spectacular views of Bilbao. It has very clean and well-kept toilets. They are continuously disinfecting everything, which is welcome in times of covid. € 15 for 24 hours, water and electricity included. You have to arrive before 11pm."
17633,1065005,5,jofred,22/09/2020,"We have been there since 6.30 p.m., there are few motorhomes, a French one among them (from 57), very welcome, I chose my location because we are 12 m with the trailer .... All for 15 € t water and electricity included"

17633,1037807,5,VanDame,09/09/2020,"A wonder of area. We came for one night and we stayed another night (theoretically the maximum allowed, 48 hours). The views are spectacular, the squares wide and pleasant. At 200m there is a grill (the brewery) but open only on weekends. Very well communicated with the old town (bus 58 that you can take practically at the door). € 15 per night, all pitches with water and electricity included in the price. Any drawbacks? Well, maybe an odor problem, which I don't know if it will be something specific. But an area without a doubt to repeat"

Services are only open from 7.30 am to 10.30 pm. and you have to ask for the key at the reception, which I don't understand (also with the COVID issue it is not a good idea for everyone to be touching the key). Water loading / unloading area very well. Spacious grass pitches. Some traffic at night."

17633,959918,5,andrearomera,13/08/2020,"One of the best motorhome areas I've been to. Very friendly staff. They accept campers and dogs. Maximum 2 nights. Very clean and large toilets, one for men and one for women, the pity is that there is no shower but one would fit perfectly in each sink. At 200 meters there is a bus stop that takes you to the old part of the city. The journey costs € 1.35 (only dogs with an approved carrier can be uploaded)"
17633,954029,5,AlberTitu,12/08/2020,"Tranquility, impressive views of Bilbao ... what more could you ask for. For € 15 you have your little plot, with water electricity ... and emptying services etc. Yes it is true that it is far but you have the bus that goes to the center every 30 minutes. We traveled 4 and a large dog and the same concierge of the area called us to a taxi that lets you take Dogs in it. And on the way back we called for him to come and pick us up and the same. The taxi cost us € 11 to the Guggenheim."

17633,931780,1,anaaicha,05/08/2020,"If you don't have a motorhome, don't bother coming, they won't accept you, I think you're going to pay the same so it seems silly that they don't let you."

17633,894732,1,janenjona,24/07/2020,"Unfortunately we weren't allowed to camp at this place because the ""employee of the campsite"" did say that we didn't had a campervan. We transformed our car Opel Zafira into a campervan. We did tell the man that we sleep in the car and we did show him the inside of the car.. but hé was a bit unfriendly."
17633,891912,5,Lilyviajera,23/07/2020,"Nice place to stay, 48h maximum. € 15 per night. Beautiful views. Bus every half hour to the center of Bilbao.

17633,865366,4,familiadieguez,13/07/2020,"Very nice views of the entire city, all services. But € 15 seems expensive to us and is very far from the city center."
17633,861197,5,silvia28035,11/07/2020,15 euros with water and electricity and very cool views of the city. At the door a bus passes that takes you down to the old town.
17633,858904,5,RVs,10/07/2020,Amazing views. € 15 night. In the squares below road noise. Various filling and emptying points. I miss some point of washer dryer near or in the same area but it is not something essential so I also give 5 * A few meters from the bus stop to the center that passes every 15-20min and costs € 1.35 trip
17633,844522,5,Penquins,01/07/2020,Great clean stop over ...Covid conteol
17633,841189,3,mothais,29/06/2020,"Closed area due to the Covid. We found a flat car park for 2 spaces a little further, at bus station 58, Masustegi Estrata. very calm night."

17633,787093,2,stengardarna,26/02/2020,"Ok it's a beautiful view over Bilbao, so it could be worth to stay only for that. But some things made us a bit uncomfortable:
- Big headlights like a football stadium on the whole parking. 
- Survelliance cameras everywhere in the area, every spot!
- Police cars came once in an hour patrolling the area.
This all made us feel a bit worried instead of feeling secure unfortunately."
17633,786826,4,Helton,26/02/2020,"Stunning views, friendly welcome, just a little too pricey for this type of stop. We walked into Bilbao, which took the same time as the return on the bus. Old Town interesting and refreshingly gritty, a whole street of goth paraphernalia!"
17633,786293,4,johng,25/02/2020,"Stayed here for 2 nights after arriving on the ferry. Site was well maintained, clean service area and toilets.  Great views and lovely and quiet by a nice park. The 2 attendant we spoke to were very helpful. You can only pay for 1 night at a time and maximum stay in 48 hours. Bus 58 takes you into town and takes about 45 mins cost €1.35."
17633,786039,2,metaliko,24/02/2020,"I put two stars because it seems to me that an area of these characteristics should have some more bathroom since it only has one for men and another for women, it also lacks a swing area for children, the area itself is well leveled, and You have water and electricity in each post. To get down to Bilbao downtown area safe use bus. Even some sinks are missing, given how big it is."
17633,784464,5,idoyasaenz,22/02/2020,"Spectacular, quiet area, with all services, you can stroll through the area, there are great marked routes and you can also get down to the center, both by bus and taking a walk if you do not mind walking ... we will return safe."
17633,784163,5,leonII,21/02/2020,"A room with an incredible view of the lights of Bilbao, that's what this spot allows you. A most pleasant welcome, nothing more to ask ... The direct bus also gives you access to the old town ... 2 steps from the Guggenheim Museum."
17633,783650,5,hbspc,20/02/2020,"Very good pitches, fresh water on pitches, very informative staff. 17 amps!, €15 per night, Local bus outside gate every 15 minutes, Fantastic views, Toilets okay, Would be great if drainage on pitches, as well as a good size toilet block and bar and restaurant was there, but i think theres one along the road"
17633,779859,4,Antaress,13/02/2020,"Very good views Very large spaces, with own water. The wifi did not connect. Away from the city center, but bus 58 almost at the door (in about 20 minutes you are in the center)"
17633,779339,4,pec66,12/02/2020,In this period we spent 3 nights. For 15 euros guarded parking with all WC services. Bus stop to visit Bilbao at 100m. Magnificent view of Bilbao.
17633,778663,3,15plus3,10/02/2020,"We were here from Saturday to Sunday. Space was moderately occupied. Attention: in order to draw water (at each parking space) you need a 1/2 ""connection of the usual 3/4"" which most have with them does not fit because no tap was installed. it would be nice if the individual places were better leveled. Although this is criticism at a high level, the city still charges € 15 / night."
17633,778281,5,AlonsoCina,09/02/2020,Really an ideal place. Great view of the city and bus in front of the gate. the second row of stands one floor up has the wonderful view.

17633,773879,3,Fluffshizzle,29/01/2020,"3 stars based on location. Just caught the 58 bus into Bilbao which was extremely convenient. Catch the bus to Bilbao from the bottom of the road, opposite side to motorhome Park. Ribera market is close to terminus and then about 5 stops on tram to Gugenheim (about 10 mins). Camping plot uneven and no showers but small shop selling basics su h as bread and some camping supplies."
17633,773130,5,ademortier,27/01/2020,"Great view. All services. Take the key to the toilet at reception. Bus 58 to the city. A word of advice, go to the end of the line. Friendly staff."

The bus is convenient to the city centre, but it is a slow 30 minute ride for €1.35pp.  Much safer than sitting in a car-park down town as we have done on previous trips.  Expensive at €15, so one star off.  Good staff.  This place is very busy even in October, think about booking ahead unless you can arrive in the AM.   The Guggenheim wasn’t worth the ticket, just take a couple of photos of the outside and call it done !"

17633,111287,5,sonilou47,24/10/2016,"Great view ! The area is very pleasant, the center is easy to access thanks to the n58 bus line. Parking in Bilbao costs €6 for 3 hours, so €15 for 24-hour parking + electricity + water + toilet + the view... It's perfect!! We'll come back."
17633,110093,3,Vito115,15/10/2016,"Secluded area from the city center, but the bus passes through the door of the area. It does not have a shower and only has a men's room and a women's room. But they were pretty good for what we've seen out there. It has very good views of Bilbao. And right next door there is a park with a very large sports area. We found 3 horses in the park of a nearby riding stable. Very good for walking the dog in the morning or going for a run."
17633,109948,4,MarliMarl,14/10/2016,"Great view, the guards speak English (one speaks French very well) and are super welcoming and helpful. Bus 58 a few meters from its terminus in the old town (1.25 euros). Spacious places and very good and clean services. Very good for visiting Bilbao."

There is a small reception with basic products and a pizza is possible. Very quiet and clean with spectacular views over Bilbao. Perfect for going with a dog, there is a park next door to take them for a walk. A great place to sleep without a doubt."
17633,99509,5,Loka2015,24/08/2016,"Very beautiful, very clean area. Secured by guard, bus 58 because far from Bilbao, all services, I recommend"
17633,99508,5,jcasabell,24/08/2016,Good services and good views. Lorenzo even accompanied us to a gas station. The worst thing is that it was short.

17633,74560,4,R_V_L,25/05/2016,"Rather expensive for a terraced car park but there was a lot of work going on in April to make it better. It's well staffed and, although you have to ask for a key, there are toilets. The port areas of Gexto and Portogalette, accessed east and west by underground, are more interesting than the city itself, with escalators, furniculars and a wonderful bridge - Viscaya - which is a UNESCO site."

17633,43539,5,dbfoe,23/07/2015,"Superb view of Bilbao. We had a lot of trouble finding it because Orange didn't want to operate in Spain. €15 for the vehicle with water, electricity, oil changes, a guard and bus 58 at the foot, that seems reasonable to me. Our large French cities should take example. And the view."
17633,38651,5,jacky40,08/06/2015,Very friendly welcome. well shaded location. we will come back.

17644,3196899,4,leZenroulotte,21/08/2023,"the place is really extraordinary, but the problem is the people who pass at midnight and speak very loudly without any respect (it's becoming a habit), especially in Spain. beautiful starry sky"
17644,3163626,5,tribulosvientos,16/08/2023,"Slightly sloping terrain, and people camp with everything, chairs, tables, tents... The reservoir is clean and there is a lot of beach area to be at your leisure, no problem for dogs. You can do water sports, right there they rent canoes. We did 2 nights without problem, the place is spectacular."
17644,2869634,4,Miranda1,19/06/2023,"had a wonderful quiet night and were alone here. during the day a number of people looking to cool down. 8 places may be a bit much because the terrain has a lot of bumps, so not every camper gets everywhere."
17644,2706517,2,Kartoffelsuppe,29/04/2023,"Very nice place, great view and perfect swimming opportunity. Total silence until 10:30 p.m. Then unfortunately a group of people with three cars came. We parked back and forth, unpacked tents, set them up and at 11:30 p.m. the feast began with loud conversations. A pity! Unfortunately we had to continue."

17644,1438655,5,ccarras,11/08/2021,Spectacular site. We spent the night on the shore of the lake with 4 other vans. During the day a lot of people go but around 19: 30-20: 00 it empties and we only stay in the vans to spend the night.
17644,1393515,4,tamarhill,02/08/2021,"Beautiful spot right by the lake with loads of space. Quite a few people swimming/picknicking when we got here around 5pm, but after 8pm they were gone. We stayed here for one night with 2 other vans. Police drove by in the morning without saying anything, probably more to enjoy a sunrise over the lake;-)"

17644,969905,4,Romerin,16/08/2020,"Perfect place to spend the night and the day. We were lucky that there was a group of 6-7 people or know, that they entertained us all night with super loud music, songs, voices, etc. the truth is that the kids had a lot of stamina, until 8am a detail on their part, note the irony. If not for that little detail, the site is worth it, we were unlucky."
17644,958192,5,nerealmu,13/08/2020,"Busy place during summer days (families and groups of friends), the water a little stagnant but the views are very beautiful. At dusk it is very quiet and you have the dim light of the nearby residence, with one of the most starry skies we have seen ... We were a little scared when at 22:00 7/8 cars appeared together, they were a group of families doing night kayaking!"
17644,941239,5,JoseAngelGarcia,08/08/2020,"Beautiful site on the shore of the tuff reservoir. There is shade from some trees but not too many. At night it is pure tranquility and by day the normal of a reservoir if you come in summer, there are people. To spend a perfect couple of days!"

17644,630016,5,taniafserna,15/08/2019,"We sleep alone in this beautiful area, ideal to spend the day bathing in the reservoir. We were going with a child and a dog and everything was great. At 10 am people started to go kayaking, but there was plenty of room. The truth is that to be August there was nothing crowded, a luxury!"
17644,563633,4,SPIZA,19/07/2019,Great place with views of the swamp and mountains ... good bathing area and relatively flat ground. There is no mobile coverage in the area. At the end of the road there is a campsite. Bins: No Wc: No Water: No

17698,3116394,5,mattmexico,10/08/2023,"Nice place. Next to a school, sports and pool complex. Can be a little noisy in the evening when youngsters hang out but nothing bad. One part of the place is uneven but not to bad neither. Was standing here for 5 nights. Nice village life with restaurants, bars, a grocery store and bank minuets away walking. Good for bigger rigs, I have 7mtr length."

17698,2990092,2,bobby29,20/07/2023,We arrived with high hopes … disappointed tbh.. it was a strange bad vibe. It’s grotty and tucked behind a sport centre (a ware house with basket ball court) the swimming area was all closed off and not very well kept. There was a sign up stating that if the services were closed it was because the youngsters of the village had vandalised their own sport centre and pool area. Which leads me on to the young lads loitering around in the car park. Banging and smashing things just trying to be intimidating
17698,2937524,4,MC4333,08/07/2023,Everything working correctly. Very calm. Perfect to get to know the area. Thanks Barzana.
17698,2739106,4,zwoiufftour,10/05/2023,Good for sleeping and doing services. We didn't find a swimming pool for the showers. Good as a starting point for hikes. Location is quiet but a bit depressing to stay. Nice village with a sidreria with daily menu.
17698,2701821,4,Cristina.L.B.,27/04/2023,"Free water service, emptying of gray and black water. There are several mixed plazas but it is very poorly leveled. The Senda del Oso is nearby and there are many services in the town (bars, shops, pharmacy,...)"
17698,2202254,4,Claradou,09/08/2022,Good place to spend the night. Next to the pool and pavilion. In summer there is a bathroom and shower service during pool hours from 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. for €3. All clean.
17698,2048819,4,laguneja,08/07/2022,"The area is where it always is, next to the pools and the pavilion. It has a cover because they also take advantage of the space to hold the livestock fair. If you have a license plate, you park outside and that's it. When there are fairs or an event is when they move the motorhomes to the parking lot on the outskirts. 300 meters further."
17698,1974807,3,anaman,13/06/2022,"They have put a metal cover and the ACs parking lot has been moved to the outskirts, right at the entrance to the Industrial Estate. The change of waters is still here, as from the beginning of the area."
17698,1734447,4,HooLee,15/01/2022,"Quiet night, with all services, in winter the water is cut off due to frost. Next to the river. During the fairs you can not park, at the exit of the town there is another car park that allows motorhomes to go."
17698,1651981,4,Josio,19/10/2021,"Very quiet but small area, few official and tourist-sized squares. When we were there, a kind of fences had been installed in front of us, I suppose to tie up the cattle during the fairs, which can make maneuvering at long tanks quite difficult, especially to access the filling and emptying area."
17698,1636875,5,carmengozalo,10/10/2021,quiet area next to town

We arrived at 8:30 pm on a Friday and it was quite crowded with people watching the sunset and at the beach bar. At 10 there was already a lot of space. Of course, if you want to move it has to be first or last of the day, it peta so much during the day that it is difficult for you to have room to maneuver. There are two other parkings on the beach, maybe easier in summer. The beach and the views from this spectacular parking."

17779,2215129,5,McDreamy2022,11/08/2022,"Only recommend! Such an amazing spot for free to stay at. Close to a market if you like to walk. That night there was a night market going on with a fair in town, looked so nice! But at the spot itself it was quiet and so amazing to sleep w to the waves. Woke up during sunrise. Tip: take a walk to Praia das Azenhas do Mar, 800m walk for the most amazing view and pictures of the town on a cliff, white houses, beach, beach restaurant down the cliff (take stairs) soooo beautiful! Go with sunrise! On the way there is a small cafe, opens at 12:00pm on the cliffs."

17779,451209,5,caspernl,09/04/2019,"Incredibly beautiful place, only a few people who come to enjoy the view in the evening and at night we were all alone. Still a restless night because it started to blow strongly at night, making a lot of noise and causing us to be in a shaking bus."
17779,283415,5,claudiadpn,08/07/2018,Super sunset. Quiet corner isolated from the road by the sea. Really top!
17779,169416,4,Mabu,09/08/2017,"Parking by the ocean, great view! Just off the road so a little noisy but not disturbing! No access to the beach and no service. 30 minutes from Lisbon, it's really good!"

17793,2433558,3,KKF,09/10/2022,"Quite an isolated area, between two warehouses shared with cars and next to the road. Just right for the night. The bar, the bakery, etc. It's gone because there's nothing around here. at 600mt. there is a supermarket at the Bon Area gas station. Good for the services and because it is quite level, depending on the square."
17793,1904964,5,lavero11,21/05/2022,We stayed here for one night on our way down south. Small area for 6 or 7 motorhomes. Nice installation for emptying and filling which works very well. Thank you to the municipality for everything.

17797,3226095,2,CristinaMena,27/08/2023,"I appreciate that the city council has enabled this place to spend a good night but the road passes next to it, it is a parking lot for trucks that also get up early to leave the road, there is a wood factory right there that if you park during the week as is my case, well all the noise, plus the other side is a walk very frequented by the townspeople so there is a constant coming and going of people."
17797,3092708,4,Sara1312,07/08/2023,"Calm and quiet area at the entrance of the town. It has a toilet, tools and a laundry room for bicycles. Few places but it is not overcrowded. We were two vans and there were only 3 more."
17797,3070480,5,isa1977,03/08/2023,"I have not spent the night, but we have visited it. We slept in Hontoria del Pinar. But I want to point out that it has a bakery with great bread. The traditional bar is great, don't miss it!"
17797,3022226,3,rulandovoy,26/07/2023,"Quiet place at the entrance of the town but at 8 o'clock a siren from the factory next door sounds, an infernal noise begins and the rest is over. During the night there is no problem. More than an AC area, it looks like a truck parking lot as there were several trailers parked."
17797,2739487,1,Littel,10/05/2023,It only works for emptying and filling because the noise from the factory is infernal. We planned to spend the night but we are going to find another place
17797,2713264,3,Minotavrvs,01/05/2023,"All services operational, so it is functional. They did not charge us for water refills. The site is horrible, we 100 recommend the Remunero de Revenga picnic area. It is an exceptional place, easy access, tables with picnic benches, playground, containers, with the start of hiking trails, necropolis, etc. Be sure to visit the nearby dinosaur footprints."
17797,2657980,4,BeaNds,10/04/2023,"Trucks are also parked there, but the place makes a nice impression. Right next door a scale for €1.50. Excellent!"

17797,2606731,4,Meaza,12/03/2023,"Motorhome area on the outskirts of Duruelo. We have been staying in this area several times and have never had a problem. The site is very quiet. It is a parking area for trucks. It has the part of the tank for sewage and a tap with drinking water. Right next to it there is an area to clean bicycles, with a hose and some tools."
17797,2574685,2,Janitxu89,11/02/2023,"We have not slept. We have evaluated the place and it is located in a polygon with more trucks... it does not impress completely safe, nor is it so wide. Other campers who valued the site have also marched. We go with a dog and the road is right next to it. Even so, in the area it is true that spending the night is difficult, so having something like this can be valued."
17797,2551880,3,Burgaillo,14/01/2023,"Simple area, with services and even has tools to fix bicycles. Close to the road but not noisy at night."
17797,2530483,4,hectorom21,28/12/2022,"Area on the outskirts of town but just 5 minutes walking. illuminated and with services. In addition, BTT routes depart from there and it has a bicycle maintenance point."
17797,2488120,5,DaviddeTudela,08/11/2022,"Good area since it is wide, away from the town but next to it and the services are free. The only negative is that they park trucks and cars and do not penalize them."
17797,2444465,3,ade63,15/10/2022,"perfect for technical stop, sleep and empty and fill water, town with supermarket and bakery (there are not many in the area) ideal to visit Castroviejo viewpoint, since upstairs you can not spend the night."
17797,2315781,5,critical69,28/08/2022,"Thanks to the town hall for having an area like this, the truth is that it is nice to be able to travel to places like this, the area is in good condition and level. Clean and neat."

17797,2122039,4,Eduardomsmf,25/07/2022,"Parking with all services, to fill water, empty gray and black water. They have many places for motorhomes and campers. It is close to the town and has many services (bakery, small supermarket, ATM). Behind the parking (100m) there is a large park with picnic areas and swings. We stayed two nights with no problem. The only downside is that it is in a polygon."
17797,1970264,4,Buniel,12/06/2022,"Right now everything is working, except the faucet to wash the poti; use the hose with which they wash the bikes. Litter bin: open and leave the vehicle one meter from the sidewalk, in addition, the gray water outlet is just placed in the casket. In summary, the site is very good for loading and unloading, as we have not spent the night we cannot comment on that."
17797,1953290,2,La_poderosa,06/06/2022,Area in the polygon. Note that the ordinance only allows motorhomes. The Civil Guard fined a caravan that was with us and kicked out one who was going to put up a roof tent.
17797,1939816,1,julenmauro,02/06/2022,It is an uncomfortable and unsafe polygon with a lot of noise. nor stop

17797,1905696,4,mentos68,21/05/2022,"Perfect place to spend the night, change the waters and make a route through the area that is beautiful. Despite being next to the road, we slept great."
17797,1901044,4,Jrpmarbella,19/05/2022,"You have to appreciate this unique place in the area for Motorhomes, it must be said that they have put an area for bicycle repair and washing that clogs the drain, specifically a trash can. however it is very good. Thank you"
17797,1842577,4,tmbngr,21/04/2022,"It sleeps well despite being next to the road. There is free water service and also a BTT point to clean and repair bicycles. Above all, keep in mind that it is next to a sawmill and in the morning there is noise. Little traffic during the night, we rested well. A very good access point to Castroviejo."
17797,1836854,5,LaBimboneta,19/04/2022,"Area with all services. Although it says that you have to pay €1, today the water is free. It also has to clean the bikes. Near the village. Although it is next to the road we slept perfectly."
17797,1744752,1,nice2seeu,31/01/2022,"We tried to refill water the day before yesterday, inserted the coin (1 €) and there was no water coming out from neither of the two tabs (the one for rinsing the black water tank and the one for refill). The lever for getting the coin back didn't work either. No sign, no one answering at the city council's phone. The area is a most bleak truck parking lot."
17797,1713793,5,Nostramo,21/12/2021,"Public and free area with correct water services, station with tools for bicycles and hose for washing. The nearby sawmill makes noise until seven thirty in the afternoon and for us it is not a major problem, there will be those who will bother you early in the morning that they start work as well as the trucks that park there in the morning."

17797,1612913,3,CalViudo,27/09/2021,"The services in the area are good and the squares are big. Next door is a truck parking lot, with the noise they represent early in the morning, and next to a sawmill, with constant noise throughout the day from 8 am to 7.30 pm. It looks like there is a car (Ford Fiesta red) that uses one of the reserved spaces as its daily parking lot while the rest of the parking lot is empty. The village is beautiful."
17797,1585545,4,KaiKroner,17/09/2021,"Large, level parking lot, which is also used by commercial trucks that start quite early and make a little noise. The supply and disposal is possible free of charge, although there is a coin slot on the column. There is also a service station for bicycles with pumps and tools."

17797,1528206,4,Vickyfer,29/08/2021,"I start with the drawbacks, few places, too close to the road and the cars can be heard at night; It is an area set up in a truck parking lot. Near the town, 200m. Free gray and black water, it has a place enabled to clean, repair bikes, even with tools; about 50m behind the pallet factory there is a picnic area with barbecues, tables and a playground."
17797,1513712,4,juole,26/08/2021,"The area is very complete. All well signposted and clean. It has quite a few leveled sites. It is true that there are trucks nearby, today they started to make air in the boilers at 7:00, but they have not accelerated or anything else to wait to be able to circulate. The wood factory starts working at 8:00, but it is not a very very annoying noise but it can wake you up."

17797,1298848,5,pausina,05/07/2021,"Good easy access area along the road next to trucks. Quiet. In summer you have to be careful especially at night on the surrounding roads with the deer and wild boar. A deer appeared to us and hit the front of the AC. In Duruelo, the AC was arranged for us by a mechanic who is at the entrance of the town so that we could continue the route. Recommendable."

I don't understand what people are looking for or want to give low scores. Much exquisite that a campsite does not pay and demands.

17797,908249,3,obae,29/07/2020,"Positive: the water tap works, although it takes a while to get out. You have to put in several euros to load the whole thing. It is next to the town. On the way to the swimming pools there is a picnic area with very wide swings. Negative: kids rampage at night and truck noise in the morning."

17797,788515,2,AdriTM,29/02/2020,"It is not a pretty place to stop, but it fulfills its function. The site is somewhat neglected. It allows filling of water with a machine that accepts coins (it seems that at least 50cents) and emptying of water. With € 1.50 we fill the water tank of the motorhome."
17797,735903,2,msanz,01/11/2019,The water and other service machine (1 euro) did not work.
17797,727480,1,sirukix,22/10/2019,"Negative comments but we arrived very fair and night already. It does not have the services it offers, the source of the water swallowed the euro and no drop of water, with which impossible to load, of the sewage waters more of the same.

It is one of the few places with the option of filling and emptying.Thanks Against -> dirty place, shared parking trucks, dark. For an initial cost of € 4, you should have better services."
17797,633582,2,Nippers,16/08/2019,"Recognize that it should not be considered as motorhome area, but you have to thank the town hall for having a place available to empty and fill. In addition, the signal puts service area for motorhome. Thank you. (We have taken the opportunity to make purchases in the supermarkets of ml town)."
17797,538828,1,carlos72,04/07/2019,"Unfortunate, a truck parking lot with an area sign. Noisy, dark and dirty. For me that the mayor has ""colao"" to the council."
17797,435527,2,cpvita,02/03/2019,Conditions of derisory use: indicate that you have to pay € 4 per night but you have to go to the town hall on day habil. And if I go on a Saturday or Sunday ??? Water and discharge of blacks upon payment ... at the town hall. Very noisy and next to the road. A pity the investment without thinking about who uses it

17797,376244,3,raultg,17/09/2018,"The site is great but I only give it three stars because sharing the site with the trucks does not have charm. Well for the matter of which we have the filling and emptying services (it seemed to me that the euro coins are already thrown directly into the service machine). In the end we did not spend the night there, we went up to the Castroviejo viewpoint, calmer and surrounded by nature."
17797,252922,2,MikelNazabal,13/05/2018,"Parking together with trucks, is not bad. It has discharge of grays, dirty and load of water within 5 € that there is to pay in the ayto. Not bad for a night pass."

Then we complain that they don't let us spend the night... Not to mention the incivility in general, One crosses the street to shit at my door when behind your vehicle you also have a dirt area...

For this reason the parking lot is full of vehicles."

Bins but no other services.
No signs to say there are any issues with staying overnight.
Loved the sound of the river and easy flat 1 mile walk to Cuenca. Great base for walking and cycling."
17886,1751538,3,J.A.Herrera,09/02/2022,"perfect and quiet place to spend the night, we arrived and there were three motorhomes and when we woke up there were at least 20. far from the center but very quiet to rest."
17886,1725275,1,pedbesa,04/01/2022,"Many people not respecting the minimum standards of education, releasing gray water, taking out tables, and cooking in the street. It is a parking for all types of vehicles. How to continue with these practices, I do not know how long it will take the city council to turn a blind eye."
17886,1703958,4,garmingr,05/12/2021,"Good place to spend the night, it does not have services but it is quiet with the background noise of the river waterfall, 20 minutes from the old town of Cuenca with a pleasant walk."
17886,1650800,4,IsabelaSun,18/10/2021,"Next to the river. For summer, artificial beach at 6 euros with a beach bar. Spaciousness and tranquility."
17886,1641812,3,farrucha,12/10/2021,"Every time we got there, there was a brutal organized case, as it has no way out, you have to go to the end, if you manage to get there, to turn around. It is true that it was the Pilar bridge and it was crowded but the cars that go to the restaurant, the vans and the AC are mixed. We managed to park and spent the night calm despite being full we did not have a scandal."
17886,1639835,1,sofines,11/10/2021,"I went this afternoon and ran away, it looked like a campsite in the 3000 homes, people with tables outside and people sitting on the floor, hippie chupipandi roll, drinking, the smell of pee and clínex on the floor, there would be 50 ac and vans, without a doubt a bad image for this world."
17886,1605877,4,xanabixu,25/09/2021,"We have been on Friday night and very quiet, there were several AC and vans totally free without services, wonderful walk along the riverbank, highly recommended,"

17886,1557515,5,maria1293,07/09/2021,"You can stay overnight. From what we have seen there is always a caravan and the atmosphere is very calm. It is next to the river and several climbing sectors. There is also an artificial beach reaching the bottom of the parking lot, but it costs € 6 to enter and the river can be accessed from many points for free. Highly recommended."
17886,1556709,5,MklMns,07/09/2021,Good place to sleep peacefully in Cuenca. You can walk to the old town through the Hoz del Jucar or go up to the castle. I think the bad smell they mention is from the septic tank located in the middle of the parking lot and surrounded by concrete bollards. With parking far away there should be no problem.
17886,1524002,3,JavierIzquierdo,28/08/2021,The site is fine as a parking lot. If you want to access the pool they are 6 euros. Too many cars for the day if it is a bath day. Dogs are not allowed in the pool or in the restaurant.
17886,1475050,4,jml-24560,18/08/2021,"Great place to spend the night, very quiet. In advice, the beach closing at 7 p.m. it is easier to park. Shaded site near a tarmac and flat river. Dead end. Rather reserved for van and small camper van."
17886,1431072,3,Elyeryi,09/08/2021,"Quiet place, at least during the week, the river very close and a municipal artificial beach next to it (€ 6 person). The only downside is that the guy from time to time smells bad. You can walk to the center of Cuenca but the truth is a curious walk"
17886,1403559,4,gabilandia,04/08/2021,The land parking of the beach / municipal swimming pool next to the river. Very quiet to sleep unless you catch a holiday at the pool bar that has the music on until 2 AM. You can ask before deciding to stay for the night. A little smelly by the river but bearable. Nearby on foot there is an ascent access to the tourist center of the city.
17886,1373195,4,Nucha,28/07/2021,"Quiet, spacious location by the river. It is a stopover for motorhomes along the lighted road that goes on and ends further on at the artificial beach. We parked in the afternoon and went to visit Cuenca, which is very close to this spot. When we got back to the caravan at night, it was almost full with other caravan drivers, so the company is guaranteed. Great spot!"

17886,1076228,1,rafaydana,30/09/2020,It's just a parking lot. Asphalted. No lighting at night. Away from the monumental area. A World Heritage city deserves a decent RV park.

In addition, they have confirmed that after Villalba, the Júcar has a lot of shit from farms, and it is not advisable to bathe. but business is business."
17886,961433,3,Serlia,14/08/2020,"We slept there several vans and AC's among other cars. We spent the night from Friday to Saturday and I suppose because it was Friday there was more movement. Cars coming and going, people shouting in the parking lot at many o'clock, I think I had never woken up so many times. Although at this time and within a city, I suppose it could be worse ..."
17886,955330,4,arkadian,12/08/2020,"Good place to spend the day or night, there is no prohibition, constant movement of motorhomes and campers during the nights. During the day it is very crowded (more on the weekend) by cars for the restaurant, the river and the pool (entrance € 6.

Several motorhomes overnight in spite of being between daily. Spectacular scenery. The police passed several times during the night, but did not put any problem. You can get there by walking or cycling to the old town of Cuenca if you like to walk."

17886,458587,2,Phv150602,18/04/2019,"It is a spectacular site if it were not because we spent the night there last year ... after a few months we received a fine of € 500 at home per denomination of income: environmental sanction, description of the debt: conservation of nature . The walk was full of caravans. We were two families together, parked side by side. Unjustifiably we receive the fine and our friends do not. I understand that we were the easy photo for being the first of the ride and that we were the only ones sanctioned that night. € 500 per night! Not bad.!"

17886,438021,3,javeasteve5,09/03/2019,"17 overnighters in March, very quiet, just constant running river sound. Allow 20 - 30 mins to get to centre of town as it’s a steep climb and 5 mins to bridge. In valley so temp was in minus until sun came over top of town.  Surrounded by tall trees so in summer views would be restricted but lots of shade."

At the end of the road, 100 m, beautiful beach-pool in natural site, with trees, toilets, a picnic area, a classic outdoor pool, large and small bath, a restaurant and a bar at the bottom that sells sandwiches.

17951,3104113,4,estelle.nadine,08/08/2023,"There is no shade but if you ventilate the vehicle it creates drafts and you don't suffer from the heat. There is only where you can put the TV antenna. For the WC faucet press the button hard do not use the drinking water faucet. The toilet plate is on the ground, it's written on it. Thank you to those who left used toilet paper with their poo buddy in the gray water grate."
17951,3045378,4,Jesusvalde77,30/07/2023,"No one parks in this area. It is only used to change the waters. They all go to the parking lot of the Las Norias Complex, which is just 500 meters away where there are many trees and shade. From here there is a step that takes you directly to the city to walk."

17951,2960969,5,FamiliaRomero,14/07/2023,"In reality, the area is regular, but it is next to a parking lot with trees where the town hall allows motorhome parking, which is very good. If we combine the two it is almost perfect. The area is quiet, it has all the services for free and you are close to the city so you can visit it. Of course, if you park in the parking lot you can't take out tables or anything."
17951,2930144,5,CarmenIgne,06/07/2023,"The score is combining this area for water change and replacement and to stay there is the Las Norias car park next to it with lots of shade and lots of space. This area is neat but lacks shade, the other has shade but no services. Combinadas is perfect for getting to know a beautiful city with a lot of greenery and a very nice environment to have tapas and enjoy"

17951,2606342,2,Burgaillo,11/03/2023,"It is an area because the motorhome of gray and black water can be emptied, but rather it is a very wide esplanade, with the road next to it and with noise. We went to sleep at the ferris wheel, much better there and full of motorhomes"

It would be appreciated if there was an electricity recharging point, although, in theory, the ALDI supermarket offers a schuko recharging point (it is not in the area, it is in another part of the city)."
17951,2503588,3,Xperience,23/11/2022,"Area only for loading and unloading. Lots of noise from cars and trucks. It can be seen that they are racing and skidding because of the marks on the ground. So to stay to sleep like no. I only use it to load water. To rest better, the Las Norias car park."
17951,2499914,3,EIV,19/11/2022,"The site is very good, but at night drifting, loud music, etc. with which people park a little further on. in a large parking lot, but it is not a motorhome area as such."

There are two water taps and it doesn't seem very clear which one is to rinse the Poti and which one to load water, so we didn't get clean water. The parking lot is very large, soulless and next to the road. Also on Sunday there is a market and they occupy the area. Better to spend the night in the nearby Las Norias car park."

Many thanks to the city council of Logroño!"

Very exposed, no shade and teenaged hanging around by paths. Motorbike speeded through, car doing doughnuts at 3am, but that was surrounding roads. Where are police at night? Services work. The carpark needs shade and police patrol to stop campers parking next door"

17951,1798292,4,ErJosete,27/03/2022,"It is an area where only the deposits are filled and emptied, to spend the night people go a little further on in the Las Norias parking lot. Be careful on Sunday they put the market, I say this because of the noise and the traffic of cars."
17951,1779854,4,bettyboop29700,11/03/2022,thank you city for the free services. we just did the services and slept in the pool parking lot 500 meters later
17951,1772166,3,PetenBev,03/03/2022,Not signposted but good dump and refill facilities. In a huge parking area. There were no other motorhomes and didn’t want to leave ours unattended so moved on. Would have considered using it for a night stop if there had been other vans.

17951,1704979,3,Remolin,06/12/2021,"In practice, it is used more as a filling and emptying area than for parking and spending the night, being for the first of its purposes excellent, but for the second it is a remote wasteland without any shade. Therefore, people prefer to park and spend the night in the parking lot of the swimming pools."
17951,1693233,5,chivirina,19/11/2021,"We have slept here 2 very quiet nights. To the center there is a 15-minute walk along a tree-lined promenade along the river.

Thanks to the city for the service."

17951,1683592,4,TonyandWendy,09/11/2021,"Good service area for filling and emptying. Far nicer to park 200m down the road in the tree lined car park near the municipal camp site (approx 150 spaces). No services but quiet, shaded and a little closer to the town (well worth a visit for the tapas with bells on lol). Fabulous market held on a Sunday so don't park on the 2 rows closest to the river."
17951,1672655,3,Saroushe78,01/11/2021,Good to empty the water to sleep it is better to go to the parking lot at 200 meters where there are plenty of camper and van but it is quiet
17951,1672115,3,Primpiratas,31/10/2021,"For perfect emptying. Opposite gas station with super. It is in the huge parking lot of sports facilities. But because of the comments we continued on to the Las Norias car park, which was full and gives more security."

17951,1612831,3,CalViudo,27/09/2021,"We were there on 18/09 and the venue in the area was occupied by the San Mateo Festival fair, so it could not be used. Luckily, there are other areas nearby. As stated in other comments, the place does not give security and it is more reasonable to spend the night the large parking lot which is about 150 meters."

It is not a good place to sleep, a street below there is a parking lot in which we are surrounded by other vans and AC. Without a doubt it is much better to go down to the other. Of course, if gray water has to be emptied, it has a suitable point for it."
17951,1545239,4,17mendi,04/09/2021,"Large parking lot to park and spend the night, the only thing is that it is a bit uneven, and some colleagues instead of parking correctly on battery park crossed occupying several places !!! Then we complain that they take away places to park !!!!"

We buy it at La Florida Restaurant, on the Elciego city council website it details where else you can buy it. Quiet place and feeling of security. There are 14 spaces for the pole, but there is more place to park if you don't need electricity."
17951,1481403,4,joanicoAC,19/08/2021,Good for Logroño to have an area to empty and fill. And an area with shade 100 meters where you can park and spend the night. If you can park on battery.

It is a great place and it is central. but it is a place to park and you can stay and sleep. It is not a camping site. Please no tables or chairs or awnings."
17951,789390,3,padraigl,01/03/2020,"This is a massive carpark with 3 dedicated motorhome spaces just inside the entrance beside the services.

There are 2 large lorry type motorhomes that seem to be parked permanently beside the services. They also seem to be plugged into electricity and water with pipes and cables disappearing into the path.

There are free services excluding electricity here.

The grey waste is a centre grid with good flow direction.

The black WC drain is at ground level under a large stainless steel cover with a handle. The drain is large with very little splashback. The cassette tap is a push button with weak pressure hence no splashback.

The fresh water tap is a medium screw-on connection with a 3/4 turn handle and excellent pressure. 

There is a large bin beside the services.

Pros:
Free parking.
Free full services excluding electricity.
Walking and bike paths.

Road noise.
No shade.

17951,684373,5,chisca,10/09/2019,Thank you !! LOGROÑO! A little far to visit the city !!!
17951,576678,5,AutoBeni,26/07/2019,Thanks to the city council for the services. But to visit Logroño we prefer to park closer to the center. This area is far away ...
17951,575102,3,JackieyNuca,25/07/2019,With services On the side of the road.
17951,573578,3,Naussy,24/07/2019,"The area as such to use the services and nothing else, located in the industrial estate, without shadow. We have slept nearby, in Las Norias Park accompanied by many ACs, with shade. Next you have the sports center that you can enter by paying € 16 day ticket. At night we were spent with the girls, there is a green area next to it and bike lanes to tire them at night, of impossible day! Very hot."
17951,541070,1,Sergioscar,06/07/2019,Set how the cockroaches run through the area of waste discharge and nearby
17951,536171,3,claudedeg,02/07/2019,Drainage area and free filling on an old parking lot on a roundabout so in the sun and noisy. It is better to spend the day and the night on the parking lot of the sports complex Las Norias which is shaded (free). 15 min walk to the super center city very large and very nice. Beautiful walks or bike rides
17951,528962,3,gsilva211,26/06/2019,"Nobody sleeps, poorly located but perfect services."
17951,504268,4,retraite86,04/06/2019,There is the carnival that settles down we did not stay
17951,448097,5,pello,02/04/2019,Many places
17951,438201,4,autochalet,09/03/2019,"Very noisy, three adapted seats but a huge lot where bottles are made, next to the road, it has all the services. It is a bit far from the center, we all sleep in the parking lot of the ferris wheels"
17951,436728,5,marionleon,05/03/2019,"Perfect for services. We slept on the other parking, under the trees and near the pool, it's more fun."
17951,433997,4,Inestosi,26/02/2019,We were on 25.02.2919 here except us two RVs. But we still felt safe. The road in the background is a bit noisy. To visit the city we drove 850 m to the Paseo de las Norias from there it is only a few minutes into the city.
17951,425060,4,zalaska,27/01/2019,"A complete service area with separate gray and black water drain, two taps to recharge in clean water. The places are delimited. The parking is huge. We were not disturbed by noise during the night, contrary to some comments. On the other hand, by going back we saw several tens of CC 800 meters further along the river so more calm"
17951,424644,1,inyaki0404,26/01/2019,Fatal for the night. Two young people with bikes giving gas plus botellón at the end of the parquin. We had to go to a wooded park located about 100m further on to rest and continue the trip. We have not changed waters.
17951,417270,2,AritzL.,29/12/2018,"To sleep poorly, at least on the weekend. The youth does not respect anything. He kept us awake until 3.30. for emptying and filling Ok."
17951,412110,2,vinny278,05/12/2018,"Here tonight(Wednesday) they are having drum practice outside. Started 2045 hrs! Hope it doesn’t go on too long!also cars seem to like parking facing you with their lights on you, when they are not racing around."
17951,411877,4,nocillastrip,04/12/2018,"I agree with the previous comments. Perfect area to download and load, but to sleep, the one next to it is better (trees, less traffic)."
17951,356120,5,camilo,27/08/2018,I did usual here and I went to the parking next to the swimming pools that is 15 minutes from the center by the iron bridge. my valuation is joint of both sites. very good tapeo by street laurel and san juan. Thanks Logroño.
17951,351489,4,dekapax,24/08/2018,"Far from the center but emptying grays and blacks and free water, we suppose that it is safe to drink since nothing indicates otherwise. To spend the night all the ACs go to the nearby parking lot because it has no trees. Thanks to the City Council for giving free benefits even if it's a tad far"
17951,282532,4,tomel33,07/07/2018,Service area very well done. 200 m from a large car park where to park and spend the night. Thank you to the Municipality of Logroño for the welcome.
17951,276465,3,lidiadelgadosan,28/06/2018,"Very large parking, so it is difficult to stay without a place, but at the same time there are seasons in which it is very soulless. I have spent the night here with 3 more AC. It is in front of a gas station. A motorbike did not stop going through the parking lot going around 2/3 of the night, although I suppose that will be something punctual."
17951,253204,3,JavierMajuelo,14/05/2018,Carry and download here. To spend the night looking for parking in Las Norias. All wooded. 600m further on. Urban bus shuttle to the center. Skate track. Bar inside facilities.
17951,228648,3,CapitanClick,20/03/2018,"Simple, with all the operational services and in front of the gas station. Being inside a gigantic outdoor parking is impossible to run out of place in the place, which on the other hand and in winter make it a somewhat soulless area."
17951,197031,3,catmovil,24/09/2017,September 21 is San Mateo. They put the fair and the circus right in the Area so do not go!
17951,155978,5,JoseyCharo,22/07/2017,Free area with all services All ok
17951,145510,2,killobermeo,25/06/2017,"Bad location, gives little security and no shade. Address to the campsite (500m) there is a wooded parking where you can spend the night and where there are more motorhomes"
17951,137043,5,Just.TM,24/05/2017,"In summer 2016. Free service area. With places to spend the night, but without shade."
17951,116662,3,Fy64,26/12/2016,Very large parking near the road. The only interest: the ability to drain and replenish water
17951,80593,4,leozamoraco,10/07/2016,"Good place for the night, quieter than a priori may seem. Gray water discharge and WC. Drinking water. A little away from the center. We spend 4 ACs."
17951,66443,4,aitorfg,27/03/2016,"It is a little away from the city center, quiet area and close wc"
17951,62200,3,pelware,04/01/2016,"Good free area for filling and emptying gray and black. The black ones are emptied next to the garbage container, where on the floor there is a metal lid. Good initiative on the part of this town."
17951,60157,3,luthy,19/11/2015,"Very large car park with water and garbage service, convenient place because close to the city and buses, nice view of the bridge. :-)"
17951,51591,5,ktm4tiempos,23/08/2015,Very comfortable to visit the city.
17963,3268863,3,dzone,07/09/2023,"The site is good, large, well-kept and quiet plots, but the price has gone up. €12 in September, without electricity seems high. So it happens, it is almost empty and therefore absolute tranquility. For those who don't know the place, it is fine for one day, there are just a couple of bars, a mini market, a non-usable micro beach, a nauseating smell, and tranquility, as much as you want."
17963,3254584,5,krisGodoy,03/09/2023,We went at the beginning of September and it was very very quiet. The receptionist is a very friendly man who explains the areas and some restaurants to eat at. Cheap quality price. clean bathrooms
17963,3236491,4,Enriqueb,30/08/2023,"spacious plots and very clean services, the downside is that the beach (which is attached to the area) is completely made of stones"
17963,3227359,5,Many46,27/08/2023,"near the beach and the bus stop, it also has a bike lane to chipiona. Very friendly and attentive owners."
17963,3212461,5,aolcoz,24/08/2023,"Ideal area to spend a few days. Showers very good, and water change service very good too. The staff very friendly."
17963,3206465,5,alexceuta,23/08/2023,"Recommended place to visit, San Lucar, every year we stay for a couple of days, to enjoy the gastronomy of the area, services as described."
17963,3163494,3,RITXALY,16/08/2023,"The good thing is that in five minutes you arrive at the bus stop that takes you to Sanlucar, the rest is normal, few sinks and bathrooms for all the people it welcomes. By the way, the beach next door is not worth many stones and rocks. Everyone goes baker the days except the holidays. Good to visit Sanlucar and little else."
17963,3145673,4,riviera2016,14/08/2023,"The area is very good and the owner tries to accommodate you so that you feel at home. The only thing that caught us on hot days and the beach until low tide is impractical and there was no way to cool off in the area and it became unsustainable, but highly recommended."
17963,3125877,2,TXUS86,12/08/2023,"Great good treatment, worth the lack of attention to pests, polgas, bugs, aphids etc, etc. The washing machines do not work well, the showers 5 minutes €1, the toilets you take the paper with you. The large plots depend on the area you choose. About €15 and the 20 with more space, separation of hedges, very quiet but without fumigating those hedges and the ground full of red ants, ladybugs, etc."
17963,3107841,5,maitebiain,09/08/2023,A very quiet place. It has all the services of a campsite being an area. Everything is very clean and the workers are very friendly. It is next to a beach bar and the beach and there is a bus stop to go to Sanlucar. Very good area! To repeat!
17963,3096868,5,LauraMoyaT,07/08/2023,"The perfect area, clean services, next to the beach and very attentive staff. Last year we were here and this year we returned. A perfect place to visit Sanlúcar and escape the Levante wind."
17963,3082749,1,Canarias_Viaja,05/08/2023,"We went in to ask and the receptionist told us that he didn't know if there were any free places, that we should go and see if there were any empty places. He gave us a very bad impression because of the little help he offered us. We went to the area next to it, very close."
17963,3064357,5,oscarvanlife,02/08/2023,"Exceptional, very spacious area with all services, showers €1/5min and washing machines €3-4. The nearby bus stop that takes you to the center of Sanlúcar. Only €12 /24hrs. We will definitely be back."
17963,3042996,5,rifterako57,30/07/2023,Perfect place to spend a few days at a good price €12/24h in high season. The beach a step away and the bus 2 minutes away that leaves you in the center of Sanlucar (approx €8 return by taxi). The facilities are quite good (shower 5mins/1€) but little shade. 100% recommended
17963,3039387,2,amrtrigano,29/07/2023,"AC parking has little. It seems like a campsite rather at the price of an AC area. If what you want is this, it is your perfect place. Many caravans and constant circulation of cars until late at night and even people outside without letting them rest. Hopefully you catch the beach with water, if you don't have to walk 200m to get your ankles wet. A disappointment."
17963,3038985,4,cintyapinilla,29/07/2023,"We spent a very quiet night, the area is very complete with everything you need: showers (for €1), toilets, washing machine, sink to wash clothes by hand, sink... The only downside is that there is no paper in the Never in the girls' bathroom, but in the boys' one... The beach is a bit seedy because it's the mouth of the river."
17963,2996840,1,LeeRH,21/07/2023,"Had planned a stop on the site for 1 night whilst passing through. Felt we were an inconvenience from the moment we were trying to check in, and given a list of electrical items we weren’t allowed to use. So we exited and are staying on a close by site."
17963,2985212,5,carevalo,18/07/2023,"We have been sleeping there yesterday and I have to admit that I have not found someone as kind as the owner Mr. Alfonso has provided us with everything we need, the facilities are very well cared for in detail with all the services. I am clear that if I have to go to sleep in the area I will repeat here! And he recommended us where to go to eat and fabulous he was not wrong with everything he told us! thank you"
17963,2967213,5,Elcanario,15/07/2023,"Great as always when I have visited this place, Alfonso every day has the best area I have seen in various places, and an extraordinary price with all services except electricity. I will repeat if I can again and especially with the good gastronomy of San Lucar de Barrameda."
17963,2911422,5,josenero,01/07/2023,Good place in a wonderful environment and with the good treatment of Alfonso who is a crack. Bus and taxi to Sanlucar. I will definitely be back.
17963,2911359,4,Falcon71,01/07/2023,well located. beach nearby. bus to san lucar 2 types of rates according to zone. Good services. recommendable. with time the shade will improve.
17963,2900869,5,RutaCadiz,28/06/2023,"Everything was perfect and very quiet, they gave us very good advice to eat in San Lucar, especially since one of us is celiac, beaches very close and good morning walks, we will certainly repeat soon."
17963,2876312,3,CarmenSan,21/06/2023,"The area is good and enjoys all the services, pitches delimited with hedges and grass for €20, €15 if you spend more than one night or gravel pitches for €10 per night. The downside is the amount of ants and flies there, perhaps they should spray. And in the morning on the beach the sea water is too far away to be able to take a bath, it is not possible until 2:00 p.m. There is a bus that goes to the town."
17963,2868704,2,Tonioga,18/06/2023,"We did not like it. At 50 meters and at high tide the sea arrives. That does not mean that there is a beach (what I understand by beach). In addition, silence is not respected, after 1:30 a.m. you can hear a lot of noise from other users. Until someone honked the horn to shut them up. The best is the Gaspar beach bar. The treatment of the staff very well. I miss enforcing the silence of the night. I will not come back."
17963,2853743,5,Juaida,14/06/2023,"We have spent some wonderful days in this place, everything is very clean, exquisite treatment, very good parking, a very quiet place near the greenway, 100% recommended"
17963,2833902,5,Montanerosviaje,08/06/2023,Very spacious gravel area for €10/night without electricity and if you want more privacy there is a slightly more expensive grassy area with hedges (€20 1N and €15 from 2N). Beach 5 minutes. Basic and sufficient services.
17963,2793623,5,franrokarim20,28/05/2023,"The area is fantastic. It has all the services and there are two areas, one of gravel with electricity that costs €13 a day and another of grass with a little more privacy that costs €18 a day. The beach is literally 5 minutes away and it is a super quiet place. It has a store nearby where you can make some emergency purchases and a beach bar on the beach. We will return without a doubt"
17963,2742526,5,ruip,11/05/2023,"Great spot to stay overnight.
The owner is super friendly and helpfull. 
For a fair price you get the services you need. 
Paid 10€   3€ for the rlectricity.
Recomend."
17963,2721004,3,x3camper,04/05/2023,"Quiet place, with large and cheap plots, the bad ones are the WCs that there are only two and they are very small and old, the showers are very good although they are paid, in the store they have fresh drinks and something else. Good access to the area."
17963,2716930,1,Marylene_49,02/05/2023,"Attention ⚠️ Before settling in.... ask for the price of the night. We paid 45 euros in cash for 3 nights without electricity on the grass, very narrow location .... without bill .... the rates do not correspond to Park 4 night ....."
17963,2704324,3,abeille79200,28/04/2023,"Close to the beach where it is not suitable for swimming. the grass plots are with electricity, the others on stony ground. The floor of the toilets is rotten, new toilets are under construction. the pitches are spacious. there are drying racks above a tunnel so no washing lines between the trees the owners are friendly"
17963,2685222,4,elrond22,21/04/2023,"Close to the beach and a very good beach bar. Level pitches. All right. You can go to the town by bus or taxi, to walk it is far. Regarding the parking area, it is true that there is an area of grass and trees but it does not offer it, the parking spaces are with stone floors and without trees."
17963,2677766,5,tonysan,17/04/2023,"Spectacular gravel area site. And grass, the owner is super friendly, with all the services. I recommend it. We will be back. Chiringuito open on the beach."
17963,2665070,1,NINICA,12/04/2023,"The part that he offered us was a true dry channel, having garden areas with grass, we arrived and left, by the way, the person who answered us on the phone was not very pleasant, I do not recommend it."
17963,2657253,4,Farruquito75,10/04/2023,"Easy access, on the beach. Very clean showers and toilets. The owner is very friendly, advising us what to visit and places to eat. Quiet place, where you can enjoy your stay. We will repeat"
17963,2647724,5,PAETNERTEPEE2015,07/04/2023,"A place where if there is no place they will look for it for you! The truth is that they are very flexible and where you have all the comforts. In addition to the beach 30 seconds away, and a dream sunset! In the area they have drinks to sell and gas for the stove (I think they also have a butane bottle). Laundry, shower €1/5 minutes, good facilities."

17963,2622986,5,DutchTravellingCouple,25/03/2023,"Great camper place, with a good price. 10 euros per night without electricity. Alphonso is very friendly and tries his best. Toilets and doches are okay! We will definitely come back here!"
17963,2616816,5,connielicht,20/03/2023,perfect for a short stopover! the showers are better than on some campsites. simple but clean and spacious. Groundsman very very friendly and helpful. well worth the 10 euros!
17963,2615782,5,BW300,19/03/2023,"Large pitches that also allow for some privacy. Quiet and clean. The beach is close but not very attractive. No grocery stores nearby, but baker comes in the morning. Unfortunately, you can smell the sewage pit from time to time. Nevertheless, a nice place that you can recommend."
17963,2610714,5,HelmutMeyer,15/03/2023,Straight parking space with supply and disposal. The operator was very friendly and spent a quiet night for 10 euros.
17963,2608116,1,Inad0707,13/03/2023,"The gravel part of the site was firmly in the hands of long-term campers. The beautiful part (demarcated lawns, see photos) was closed by the police. We drove back immediately."
17963,2607249,4,jcsgalvez,12/03/2023,"The pitches are spacious although there are no shades. It has all kinds of services: toilets, showers, laundry, small shop, drain and poti, running water... Electricity connection for a fee. The manager is helpful, efficient and friendly. It solves any doubt or incidence. To visit the centers of interest in Sanlucar you need a means of transport or a nearby bus. We will be back."

17963,2596103,5,Karranzano,02/03/2023,"I just called and they tell me that due to a complaint they have closed the area, how bad envy is. Cheer up Alfonso, that everything is solved as soon as possible and that we can once again enjoy the best area in the entire area."
17963,2593011,5,Maribelcl,27/02/2023,"My five stars go to you Alfonso. Good luck and may the envy of third parties, more specifically your neighbors by profession, make you even stronger, because those of us who have been there know that you are the heir of Spain. Looking forward to the opening in the next few days of that Area, in which I have had such good days and with very pleasant attention. Greetings and strength Alfonso."

17963,2589272,5,Jerppi,24/02/2023,"nice campsite but on the 24/2 local Police came and shut the place down. Very sad cause it's a nice place. Amazing showers! One of the best showers I've ever had in my life. And believe me, I've showerd alot.
But toilets..No!"
17963,2582195,5,Franky1962,18/02/2023,"Greatly enjoyed here. Reasonable price, electro only 3 amps but still enough. Nice and smooth managers and always friendly. Well set up. Clean laundry and shower facilities. And also a large covered drying area. Definitely come back."
17963,2555023,5,igoretas,18/01/2023,"Very quiet and cozy area, with all services. Alfonso, owner and manager is wonderful, super friendly, attentive and with excellent advice. Possibility of liquids for the potti, gas...baker at 9:30 A 5-minute walk from the bus stop 3 to the center of San Lúcar. The first time we were was in 2017, we have just been again and I have no doubt that we will be back."
17963,2549116,3,Almanat,11/01/2023,"Friendly men at the reception. Too many dogs on the site as well as in the area. Showers very good, but some of the campers have probably not heard of keeping them clean. The beach, very, very wide at low tide, so no water, but very narrow at high tide. We stayed 3 nights including electricity on the gravel site = €39. No infrastructure in winter."
17963,2523403,5,tonymaria,17/12/2022,Super Park near bus 20 minutes from the center on the beach
17963,2523223,3,Helton,17/12/2022,Three stars at best. Electricity almost unuseable at 3A. Showers pretty good. Nearby beach is shabby.

17963,2479691,5,mtalhao,02/11/2022,"Quite quiet place with shades, grassed area and all the services available. Although we opted for a pitched lawn, €20, the employee reduced it to €12 because we were not there for 24 hours. We appreciate the attention. Thank you and until next time. Too bad the electricity is limited to 700W. It wasn't even worth calling."
17963,2477682,4,Miguelbg,01/11/2022,"gravel plots €10 without electricity for 24 actual hours. the light €3 but it doesn't help much, little power. grass plots are worth €20 the first day, then €12, plus electricity. Showers €1. Large plots, Greenway next door to go to Chipiona. Beach right on the doorstep (not very good). Bus to Sanlúcar at 100 meters. Quiet place and recommended"

17963,2456214,3,canglez,22/10/2022,"We stayed one night (10-15-2022). I found it expensive €12 without electricity. 3rd electricity does not help much, no air, no hair dryer, not even the coffee maker. The area is remote from everything."
17963,2453168,3,Raffilka,20/10/2022,"You can choose whether you want to stand on gravel or on grass. If you decide on the parking space that can be seen in the pictures. This costs €20 for the first night, €12 for the second night plus an optional €3 for electricity. The operator of the place is very nice and the sanitary facilities are very clean. The beach is only 2min walk away. The campsite is quite remote from the village."

But well connected by bus or taxi (journey €8) Surely it is great for long stays. Nothing is missing, well a bar wouldn't be bad hehe. 100% recommended"

17963,2286619,2,JonArroyo,22/08/2022,"We were there August 10 - 13. They only have electricity for friends. It seems impossible but regular customers have it. Flat, stone squares. The bus to reach Sanlucar is close (200m) and in 10-15 minutes in the center. Taxi return at night between €7.5 - €9.5 (depending on the taxi driver)."
17963,2282361,3,aldipa,22/08/2022,"good area, quite flat, very close to the beach (beware beach that does not cover ANYTHING and a lot of rock, at every step be careful when stepping on not to charge a rock) Showers 5 minutes €1 and some plots do not have electricity. mostly gravel floor. Quiet and fairly quiet area."

Area that is an undercover campsite, full of Caravans. I do not recommend it."
17963,2184565,5,philcan,06/08/2022,"Very good area, tranquility, security and good location near the mouth of the Guadalquivir. Clean area, spacious pitches only a little shade is still missing but the trees are planted and will provide more shade in the future."

17963,2106658,1,Maverick494,22/07/2022,we have been treated very badly by a very unpleasant man and a motorhome area that is not prepared to carry air conditioning is a whole business they do not give any type of services a shame.

When asked kindly, he only asked if I could read that parking was forbidden everywhere. (He put up skewers with ""no parking"" on all free grass spaces. The toilets are a joke. Small, old and dirty. We drove again."
17963,1939733,2,pajaro88,02/06/2022,"Plots with grass no, some grass and most of the plot is land, the light hookup with very little power, does not accept credit card, only cash, toilet facilities, very precarious showers, emptying of gray one small grid on the ground, not cemented, the beach is not suitable for bathing, the bus to San Lucas is 500m away,"

But a zero patatero to the beach that is made of stones and at high tide there is not even a meter. And there was a sewage drain at the entrance to the beach that had an awful smell. Impossible to stop for a minute"

Service except electricity included, good restaurant on the beach, small supermarket nearby, value for money was okay for us."
17963,1826211,1,PauJimenez,16/04/2022,"We called by phone 5 minutes before arrival they did not make reservations and that there was room to spare. Upon arrival a man told us that it was full. Apart from the area with hedges and grass, about 30 seats, the rest is very neglected. Not worth it. Better to go to others nearby that are better cared for and the treatment is good."
17963,1817990,1,mtthssnpy,12/04/2022,We saw the photos with the green area and therefore drove there - when we got there the owner/employee assigned us a place behind his office - catastrophic - we paid 10 € - was still too much - shower container - waste disposal outside at the Commune definitely not recommended
17963,1802266,1,higinin,31/03/2022,"Manager a liar, he says they have wifi and it's not true, I try to put him in the office with the manager in front and there is no way and he keeps insisting no (laughing in my face), of course we left, later we found out that it is not a legal AC, has no papers."
17963,1769627,4,Vkal,28/02/2022,"We were lucky and were standing in the front area on one of the large plots with a meadow, separated by hedges. I wouldn't have wanted to stand close together on gravel in the back area. Therefore 4 stars. Maximum 2 stars on the back. All facilities are functional and in order."
17963,1764642,1,Chantal33,24/02/2022,"Do not trust the photos. Pitches on grass/hedges, although free, were refused to us. Parked in front of a wall at the back of the area, stuck with other cc's and a horrible smell of urine. We stayed one night because very tired. When paying for the 8th night he asks me for 11. I report. I point out the unbearable smell of urine, he laughs at me with a smile and replies: I know. Shame Flee"
17963,1748725,4,Mbwa,06/02/2022,"We have been there twice now. Always so great! As for electricity, for the Spaniards it is false! We arrived on a Saturday, a day when there are many Spaniards (WE) so there is no longer any possibility of electricity, the boss informed us and told us that from Monday we will have it. That's all, maybe avoid arriving on a Saturday! In the nearby surroundings you have very friendly tapas bar restaurants, the Triton is very relaxing (Asian-style garden). A beautiful place this area."
17963,1743944,4,Klamott,30/01/2022,"We were only going to stay one night, which has now turned into six. Nice place and nice operator as well as everything neat and clean. We can only recommend. One point deducted for insufficient electricity supply, but that should be dealt with quickly."
17963,1743114,2,Pierredu14,29/01/2022,very average reception... electricity only for Spaniards. to avoid....
17963,1739963,2,wernermueller,23/01/2022,"Really nice operators. But they don't have full control over the electricity. We found the edge pitches ok. price too. The beach, if you can call it that, can be neglected. With the bike no e bike in 15 minutes in sanlucar!"
17963,1735212,3,Xansa,16/01/2022,"Positive: large squares, grass area, good price €8 without electricity. Negative: it is far away, you take the toilet paper, the shower is paid, the bathrooms are few and small."

17963,1731484,5,mitacita,10/01/2022,"Peace of mind, respect for schedules, there are no children playing uncontrollably, after having to leave voluntarily by someone else next door, finally EVERYTHING ok thanks"
17963,1726029,5,Samuell,04/01/2022,"We were here for 3 days over New Year's Eve and thought it was great. For us, the grass part is nicer, everything is very neat, nice and very hard-working operators. I cannot understand the comments with the garbage in the area, even over the turn of the year they were cleaned there."
17963,1725738,5,Alain33440,04/01/2022,Very good value for money € 11 with 700 w electricity enough to recharge. on an old campsite with a gravel part and another on the grass. Pleasant welcome. there are certainly better but also more pathetic ...
17963,1724800,4,wnoethlichs,03/01/2022,simple SP but with everything you need. VE good WiFi. Current unfortunately only 3 ah max 700 watts. Wet area clean and well-kept. if you need tools that's no problem either. what's annoying is opening and closing the gate.
17963,1720478,4,AntonioRodriguez,30/12/2021,"We stayed 3 days at the beach bar next door. The only day that we had breakfast in the area, the owner, who does nothing but complain about all the users, turned on the sprinklers and wet my breakfast. Very maniac, he tells you the orientation of the caravan and the tables in a compulsory way, and that you do things that damage the lawn. at 8 in the morning he begins to prune the shrubs."
17963,1705821,2,Muchona71,07/12/2021,"The site is fine; But they arbitrarily discriminate against users or following criteria that are not explicit: they did not want to give us electricity on a grassy plot and they offered it to all the other motorhomes around. Without any explanation. They may not want children in those plots. Anyway, for the power they give ... they eat it with their bread"
17963,1705731,1,LucianaFabre,07/12/2021,"I think it is about time that you have a bit of judgment when evaluating sites that are not worth it with 3,4 or 5 stars. Those of us who travel like this are guided by the comments and go with the surprises that we find. This site, unless you are one of those who do not live outside, is not worth it. The beach and the accesses to it a real garbage dump, the precarious roads, a shame!"
17963,1705595,2,STEPPHENWOLF,07/12/2021,"Area with very basic facilities. Light limited to 700W, to charge batteries, refrigerator and lighting. Loading and unloading area can be greatly improved. Located in an uninteresting and unattractive quiet area. Bus at 100m that places you in Sanlucar in 20 '. Collaborating management."
17963,1700528,5,JoseIndalo,30/11/2021,"Nice, clean place. Ideal starting point for bike tours to Chipiona and / or Sanlucar. Gladly again!"
17963,1699704,5,danreg1329,28/11/2021,"Top camping car area. Large pitch on grass, quiet at night, friendly welcome. Possibility to wash your clothes. So we stayed there for 5 days ☺️. We will not hesitate to come back."
17963,1692674,5,raimontarr,18/11/2021,"Very that Very good. service and extraordinary attention. Great gift of people of the person in charge Alfonso. Flat and spacious pitches. Laundry, Showers and Sinks more than correct. Beach 50 meters away, as well as Bus to the center of San Lucar de Barrameda. Upon arrival you will find the door closed. It's just about pushing it and in the end there is the Office. Anyway, totally recommendable area"
17963,1687154,5,Mbwa,13/11/2021,"I do not understand the negative comments! (7 night stay) Area that looks like a campsite! Top pitches on grass and some surrounded by hedges. 8 or 9 euros plus 3 euros for electricity depending on the location chosen in November. Nothing to say so much about the welcome, cleanliness, calm etc. The very close beach, Sanlucar at about 5km, the green way at 700 m. So yes on the outside it's dirty like all of Spain! Dog excrement practically in front of the gate of the area, but who is responsible?"
17963,1684904,5,martine40,11/11/2021,We spent 15 days at this place. very large plots of lawn surrounded by very well maintained hedges. The manager is very helpful and always has a kind word. showers 50 cents for 3 minutes washing machine 3 euros. shame that once out of the area the spectacle is distressing ..... dirty a very good restaurant 500m away in a tropical garden. compulsory means of transport
17963,1683985,5,Mizdo,10/11/2021,"I do not understand the negative comments since the treatment could not be more friendly, the plots are large and level ... that the power is not excessive because it is enough for normal use, the paradisiacal environment to walk and communicated with the town by a bus . Anyway, to taste the colors and this color is to my liking"
17963,1670995,1,isibot,31/10/2021,"Not at all recommended! Zero welcoming, take it or leave it should be the slogan."
17963,1663948,3,Jufete,26/10/2021,"For € 8 a day and without electricity it is not bad, since if it were more expensive you would have to fix 2 showers of the four you have and the light does not have power even to plug in the microwave."
17963,1663904,4,jff,26/10/2021,"Well-kept place with everything you need (and a little more, such as washing machine and drinking water, for example), large parcels, nicely laid out. There is a star trigger for the nocturnal continuous barking of various dogs in the vicinity (not on the pitch). Earplugs and your own dogs that are as relaxed as possible are very valuable."
17963,1663128,4,Horst0815,26/10/2021,"Large, well-kept parking space near the beach. Washing machines and space to dry are available. Nice personel. Bus stop, cafe and bar nearby. Good for a bike trip to Sanlucar and / or Chipiona. Attention: Electricity only up to 3 Amphere."
17963,1661525,1,capem,25/10/2021,"Uneven gravel pitches. Those with crowded lawns. The hedgerows tell you that they cannot be reserved and when you arrive it turns out that for some it is possible, since more than half were reserved. The bathrooms are worth seeing. The receptionist without a mask. A disaster."
17963,1658143,1,LuEm,23/10/2021,"Large plots cost double, they do not accept reservations and when asking to install a plot with grass they tell us that they are already reserved. When we told them that they did not accept reservations, they tell us that it depends and that they will not let us when applying the policy of taking children, you cannot be on the lawn They offer to wait for us at 22.45 but they do not warn that they will put us on the plot without light and gravel."
17963,1651910,5,pollitoCamper,19/10/2021,Quiet area and very spacious pitches ... friendly staff ... We will repeat.
17963,1646068,5,p46ait,15/10/2021,A very quiet and relaxing place. You have the beach as you go out. Unbelievable beautiful sunrises and sunsets. The very good treatment of all the staff and very attentive. Clean bathrooms and showers at all times. We have been there for ten days and we have paid € 120 including electricity. The large and closed plot with hedges. Everything ok We will repeat without a doubt if we return to this area.
17963,1644276,4,Nuevosmun2,14/10/2021,"Good area. € 8 / 24h (counting from the time of entry). Spacious gravel pitches. Near a beach with a very beautiful sunset, although far from the center of Sanlúcar. Good emptying service and you already have a hose for filling, just turn on the tap and that's it! The fence is always closed. Open it and go to ""Office"". They only accept cash."
17963,1629405,5,Luli70,06/10/2021,Very quiet and nice. A very good deal. We have spent one night and we have felt very safe.
17963,1616688,4,trubieco,29/09/2021,"The area with grass, large plots, all services, shade, kindness and information, is perfect. The only one hits the environment with a lot of garbage"
17963,1601676,4,rimorsailer,23/09/2021,"The area is very wide, it has plots to choose from on Chinese, grass or surrounded by hedges. It has showers, toilets, sinks, a small library ... The baker comes in the mornings. The beach is next door and at this time it is very quiet. In general it is very good and Alfonso helps and informs about everything."
17963,1601621,4,MireilleCarriere,23/09/2021,"In September, a quiet, clean and well-equipped place for a low price. warm welcome. Direct access to the beach. the surroundings are unfortunately dirty."
17963,1594652,1,fernandezfrancoise,20/09/2021,"it could be good for 13 euros. but we the manager placed us on the grass at the entrance and in the night arrived families with kid dogs and the fiesta that goes with it until 3 am! the manager did not want us to move to another location because it was supposedly closed, but others arrived and we were able to take a seat, perhaps reserved for the Spaniards!"
17963,1594521,4,Frangel,20/09/2021,"He affirmed the good previous comments, adding that there is a beautiful greenway to walk or better bike or skateboard, to Chipiona that deserves the walk."
17963,1543210,4,clarikid,03/09/2021,"A cozy area with all services, very clean and the owner very nice, you can put yourself on a plot without delimiting or delimited are € 10-12 and € 3 of light. hot water € 0.5 \ 3 min or € 1/6 min. For me you can get things all right and it is one of the few areas in that part of Andalusia like this."
17963,1543023,5,labandolera,03/09/2021,"A fantastic place, 100 square meters of lawn, the beach 2 minutes walk, all services, buses to Sanlucar de Barrameda, bread and sweets and the best, ALFONSO, a helpful and polite man, AN AREA OF 10 FOR ONLY € 10 AL DIA, what more could you ask for?"
17963,1535053,4,javyalonso,31/08/2021,"Nice place and treatment to spend the day and be able to visit Sanlúcar, albeit in a hurry. The treatment was very pleasant although I agree that the services can be greatly improved. At night the leads of the light point to which we were connected jumped and it was 8 hours without electricity that you pay the same, also that it does not have enough power but we had been warned. I hope they improve."
17963,1516574,1,ellebri,26/08/2021,Too bad of area. I have not seen in my life a more badly run business in my life the owner Saborio noooo the following. It has an area of grass that does not want anyone to get in and if you get angry then it does not want to give light to anyone and the showers are the most seedy. And another thing the price of this area is not that they put here € 12 it has risen to € 18 in plot and € 12 in the Chinese. Super bad management
17963,1510903,1,eduarj,25/08/2021,PROS: - Spacious CONS: - Insufficient services: a prefab with 2wcs and pay showers. Water points only in the entrance area. Without shadow.
17963,1498605,2,Ana1304,22/08/2021,"It is a kind of camping for motorhomes. There are shady places. It is far from Sanlúcar, to go there is a bus very infrequently."
17963,1494127,2,BERKUT,21/08/2021,"The closest thing to the corral de la pacheca, I sincerely believe that what they want is an area but at the same time that it is a seedy campsite, noise, lack of toilets and showers since caravans need other services different from cars, they tell you that There are no free places with light that are those of the lawn and you see that more than half are free"
17963,1491628,3,carmengabigon,21/08/2021,"The manager is very cool, he tells us that there is no light; We see some AC connected… We ask that they change our plot for another that we see that they disconnect the electricity and they tell us again that there is no light. Of course, very quiet and a good location next to the beach, in the afternoon the tide goes down, the children have loved looking for crabs. The chiringuito next door regular and expensive. For one night it's fine."
17963,1482424,1,Alexander75,19/08/2021,"We haven't lasted even 10 minutes. Very dirty place and very very seedy facilities. In addition, the person in charge who attended us very edge, answers out of place. Is there shade? hahaha what is that? Do not put carpet that annoys the lawn (a super neglected lawn ...). When we asked him how to put us it seemed that it bothered him, it was difficult for him to answer ... The beach is very close."
17963,1482012,1,estelavs,19/08/2021,"The area is located at the end of a street in front of what should be the beach. The reality is that it is an ugly place, without a beach as such, only rocks and stones with a lot of mold and far away, the sea. We stayed 3-4 hours and decided to leave. When paying, they did not want to charge with a card and they did not have bizum, they did not accept transfers, but we had nothing else, so they had no choice if they wanted to charge the day. The area between Sanlúcar and Chipiona is all like that, it is not worth it if you are looking for a beach."
17963,1430283,5,viajandoconlapalmera,09/08/2021,We have been this weekend and we have been very happy with this area. Although we had a ball area because we arrived very late and on the weekend .... it is luxurious. you can take out everything that a motorhome can take out.
17963,1425500,2,soniagv,08/08/2021,"Plots with grass and light and other stone without light. Of light there are very few. The beach is close but it is dirty and full of moldy stones, as we arrived we left. The area is fine and quiet, but there is little to walk around."
17963,1417738,3,carlasp,07/08/2021,"Showers, toilets and sinks are very scarce. There is no shade at all. They do not allow card payments. There are plots with light and others without it, when we arrived there were only those without light, which do not have grass. Well located, very close to Sanlúcar."
17963,1417209,5,raquelcri,07/08/2021,"Perfectly located area to visit the area. Peculiar beach, due to the rise and fall of the tide. To put one downside, toilets and showers are missing, since the expansion they have made of the area makes them stay fair. Attentive and very pleasant staff."
17963,1403320,2,jonanna,04/08/2021,We hoped for more from the place. Most of the parking spaces are in the gravel and not on the meadow. Electricity is only available on the lawns. Only 4 showers (3 minutes 50 cents) and 2 toilets for all campers. Beach only 200m away.
17963,1401495,4,Mithos78,03/08/2021,"Alfonso and his nephew keep it clean, close to the beach and bars and a supermarket. Services, 2 pay showers (you have to queue for days with a lot of people), washing machines and a sink. Pitches with gravel without light and others with some grass with light for € 3 (3Amp), they didn't let us park on grass to water it but it filled up in the afternoon and they filled all the pitches, we ran out. Advance allowed"
17963,1399425,4,javiernicolas,03/08/2021,"Simple area, very friendly, clean, close to the beach and bars, restaurants and a supermarket. Services, showers, washing machine, sinks… plots with gravel and grass, electricity available in some for € 3 (7Amp), near the bus that leads to Sanlúcar and next to the greenway to go by bike to Chipiona. To improve, more shade. They let out awnings and chairs."
17963,1393453,1,marcguille,02/08/2021,"Do you want light? forget only in some and capped at 700 watts, that is to say, laughing. do you want to go in or out? Well, you get off, open the door, go in, stop, get off and close the door. emptying and filling? in the middle of everything. sewage? filthy. do you want to pay by card? either. And above paying. With all due respect ... 500 m away there is another great area with all services and cheaper"
17963,1386675,4,RICESTER,31/07/2021,"Good lawn space, few shades but nice and very close to the beach. Services, toilet, washing machine. Good option for quiet days."
17963,1374075,4,amaiagg,28/07/2021,"Spacious pitches, grassy area, clean showers. Very friendly staff. The bad is the beach, it is close but full of rocks and seaweed. The spectacular sunset. In the morning the baker comes, nice touch."
17963,1371926,4,toriogpr,27/07/2021,"Good area halfway between Sanlúcar and Chipiona to the latter you can walk by bike path and the first by the beach at low tide, plot with ""grass"" depending on the date tb has more parking in the back without grass, parking facilities good toilet. beach 20 meters. the good thing is that you pay for 24 hours from the moment you walk in, not per night."
17963,1369118,4,jennyjenn,27/07/2021,"We have spent one night the place is convenable for one night. But there are not many places in pesarelas. We are on the central level with little grass, it is not very private but it happens for one night. The shower is € 0.50 / 3mn and € 1 / 6mn. There is a super idea clothes rack! The guy who attended us very friendly and responsible too! ! The beach is less than 50m, there is a nice restaurant in front of the sea."
17963,1361405,1,AngelMarin,25/07/2021,"A big disappointment. The photos are far from reality. They put us in a secluded lot, without light and a lot of land. Silence is not respected at night, people screaming and children playing and shouting inside your plot. They don't accept credit cards, I don't know why ..... The person who attends you at the reception was unkind."
17963,1355158,4,VaneyAdan,23/07/2021,"Very good area, quiet, 50 meters from the beach. Filling and emptying services. Showers and toilets. Helpful staff. We recommend it"
17963,1349127,5,josepsantfeli,21/07/2021,Perfect place to spend a couple of nights and visit Sanlucar !!! perfect facilities and very clean! You can drain gray / black water and fill drinking water! The manager is very attentive and gives you good recommendations. If you are in the area it is a very good place.
17963,1346660,4,afg,21/07/2021,"Quiet place very close to the beach and close to a small shop to buy, very attentive, quite clean"
17963,1343872,5,Irayi,20/07/2021,Very good site. Very good facilities and also excellent treatment.
17963,1343273,4,chessy,20/07/2021,"Located next to a beach with very warm water and that you can take dogs. If we want electricity we have to book in advance as it is not always available. It has all the services, but showers are paid (0.50€ for 3 minutes, 1€ for 6 minutes)."
17963,1341980,3,LT35YaiOi,19/07/2021,"They made us pick up and move quite quickly, as soon as we got out of our camper in the morning for some works in the houses behind the enclosure. The place itself is not bad, it is quiet. € 12 night 2 adults (I saw it a bit excessive given that toilets and showers were in prefabricated modules and they were a bit ""like that"") otherwise the beach, almost impractical, if you go with a beach idea it is not a good place"
17963,1340341,4,koopah,19/07/2021,"The area is quite good, it has plenty of space and toilet services (paying showers €0.5/3min), as well as water loading/unloading. We paid €12/day for a van/Camper without electricity, 2 people. Area of grass and highly valued shade, in the background area of less crowded gravel, which was what we were looking for due to COVID. Beach and restaurant right next to it, for our taste quite ugly and with a lot of stones."
17963,1318964,5,Jmarin,13/07/2021,"Large, clean area with good services and very friendly staff. Nearby there is a highly recommended restaurant, El Triton, great value for money. We will repeat"
17963,1308643,4,Puytri,09/07/2021,The area is fine and the man who attended us was very kind in explaining where to go in Sanlúcar. The center is easily accessible by bus and walking along the beach if there is low tide. The beach bar is worth trying from breakfast to dinner. To go to the beach better in Sanlúcar
17963,1306726,1,caravaneros,08/07/2021,"Let's see, the place is beautiful, until you come back from the beach and see that they have allowed another motorhome to park so close that we cannot even open the trunk to get the bikes out of the garage, much less open the driver's door without rubbing the other motorhome. Is it really about putting more motorhomes? big mistake."
17963,1304791,4,NaikeMaria,08/07/2021,"Great RV area. High season 12 euros normal plot and 24 very cool individual plots. 2 services for washing dishes and 1 for clothes. Several showers 6 minutes 1 euro. It was very hot inside the shower ... We were very good, we slept better. The person who wears it lovely. Next to the beach where you can go at high tide, low tide to walk."
17963,1286914,5,dzone,30/06/2021,As always great place. a pleasure to come back here. And we will definitely be back.
17963,1285370,3,sigopa,29/06/2021,"Area with several zones: lawns and divisions by hedges, only grass and Chinese with recent trees that hardly give shade. Not all have electricity and some have little power for the refrigerator. They will have to improve. The beach is full of seaweed and pebbles with shells and when the tide goes out it looks like a mudflat. Better to move to go to other beaches, otherwise fine."
17963,1284472,5,albinaiamarc,29/06/2021,"We were one day on the road. Very friendly owners, large pitches with or without grass, with or without light. They allow to take out chairs, tables and awning. Beach next door, ideal for children. Bus stop to downtown Sanlucar at 15min, Do not leave without having dinner at Casa Gaspar, the chiringuito right next to it! the only bad thing, the road to get there ...."
17963,1283603,4,loretomey,28/06/2021,"Clean, quiet place, 24h € 10. Showers and toilets in very good condition. Super close to the beach. Magnificent sunset. To put a but, road to get there with potholes. Very good night."
17963,1263110,5,AliCaravan,19/06/2021,"Very good place, large, clean, Alfonso, is a crack, attention to 10. Plots with grass, quite large, beach bar 50 meters away with incredible sea views, and quite cheap."
17963,1257688,5,massis,16/06/2021,"Fantastic area, the attention of Alfonso, unbeatable. Thank you for your effort for the motorhome world"
17963,1257505,4,Acampa2,15/06/2021,"Good place to spend the night, the nearby beach is not very pretty. Showers, although they are paid, are very comfortable."
17963,1237522,4,BoniGranada,05/06/2021,Good destiny. Good indications from the Owner I recommend the place
17963,1234615,1,nagore76,03/06/2021,"We arrived around 8:40 p.m. and when we found the door closed and a sign warning that if we found it closed we would go through and close, we assumed that when we found said sign and by the time the reception would be closed, perhaps a mistake on our part, but That does not give the owner the right to shout at us and scold us like a madman when he sees us looking for a place to park. Due to this fact and because as soon as we enter the first thing we meet is with some caravanistas with music at full blast, we decide to leave without saying a single word. We seek to be treated well and politely and calmly, and we find neither one nor the other."
17963,1232476,4,JUANCANARIAS,02/06/2021,"I have spent two very quiet nights, in the middle of Sanlúcar de Barrameda and Chipiona, I recommend it."
17963,1231025,1,Jdramalho89,01/06/2021,"Starting with the poor reception by someone who sounded like he worked in the area. He almost called me a fool for continuing under the defined ranges. Poor management, some plots can be parked on grass, others do not make me change after having the campsite ready. The bathroom at 10.30 pm with cold water. Bad spelling. Low power And it failed later. The town is very poor too. I will not return"
17963,1227953,2,Aner,31/05/2021,"I don't understand people's comments. The bathrooms are VERY dirty, people are yelling, there are hardly any shadows and the surroundings are VERY ugly. The only good thing about it is that if you get to one of the individual plots, you can have a little privacy and that the beach is so ugly that there are few people in the first and last hours."
17963,1227343,4,Carloscalvoconde,30/05/2021,"Excellent and very strategic area, ideal for walking along the beach or by bike to Sanlúcar, the gastronomic route and also to visit the Pinar de la Algaida (all by bike). Towards the other side, the Via Verde that leaves us in Chipiona, then to Costa Ballena and from there again to Sanlúcar de Barrameda, a flipe. Gastronomic route in many places and for photography as well. The criticism for the dirt in gutters, containers and agricultural areas, also the Greenways very, very abandoned and with some motorcycles circulating despite the prohibition. You have to ask Alfonso, owner of the area, where to go to eat, sure enough! The Via Verde from Costa Ballena to Rota a disaster, two iron bridges cut due to lack of maintenance. A ten for the area and the surrounding towns, a zero for its rulers."
17963,1225226,5,sresderompon,29/05/2021,"Area with spacious plots, some of them with grass (not all) and with separations that leave you a very pleasant plot. I understand that if the plaza is from the downtown area it is not the same. The beach is 200 m away (it is not the most beautiful in the area), a good atmosphere and a beach bar next to it where you can eat well. They have showers, toilets and hair dryers. We have spent some very pleasant days."
17963,1218706,5,ynka2020,26/05/2021,"Spectacular area, all very clean, with all the services. The most friendly owner impossible. the beach is better to go to Sanlucar"
17963,1216345,5,javiermaricarmen,24/05/2021,"Great value for money, couldn't ask for more for € 10 a day, well cared for, helpful, 10 for € 10."
17963,1214405,4,cevigu,23/05/2021,"Satisfied with the stay, it is a very large area and you can find a place without problem. In addition to water, discharge point, etc., it has many services that are appreciated such as sink, toilet, showers, laundry ... Although not all the plots have electricity, only the grass plots have light points and it is not easy to do with one of them. They were attentive and kind to us."
17963,1211868,1,caravanista88,22/05/2021,"Nefarious management and attitude on the part of the manager, rest hours are not respected, there is no grass on all the plots and there are plots that occupy them with more space leaving the rest with tiny places ... certainly not recommended and we will never return! !"
17963,1203889,1,autocaravir,17/05/2021,"It is an area near the beach but there is no grass on all plots and therefore there is no electricity. Good pitches are generally easily occupied and cannot be reserved. There is a page where you can book but be careful because apparently they do not allow it in the area. As for the owner of the area, he did not behave with any kindness. We will not be back."
17963,1200632,2,Katzk,16/05/2021,"We passed and it was completely packed, the motorhomes were very close, and the full season of covid did not seem safe, too much confusion, we ended up not staying."
17963,1188116,4,ilsa90,08/05/2021,"Beautiful camping spot, beautiful large pitches with grass"
17963,1175114,4,karinchristian,17/04/2021,"Made very lovingly. Alfonso very nice. What he can't do anything for are the ever-yapping dogs all around, even at night. And without a bike, it is tedious to get to where. But otherwise very recommendable."
17963,1173590,5,JuanCumplido,14/04/2021,"Fantastic place, the owner, Alfonso, is a person who attends and cares that we are comfortable, the beach, ""our little corner"" just a few meters away, the bread is brought every morning, shops and bars where you eat well, to La vera, the bus to go to Sanlúcar, a few meters away, the truth is to take a few months at ease as many foreigners do."
17963,1172507,5,Silly2020,12/04/2021,"Price-performance ratio simply top! The parking space is large and the individual plots are nicely separated and large. You feel like you are in your own garden ;-) Ideal location to explore Sanlúcar and Chipiona by bike. Alfonso is absolutely uncomplicated, very nice and helpful."
17963,1171663,5,Costablanca,10/04/2021,"One of the best areas I have been in Spain. Grass floor, good services and very friendly attention from the owner and maintenance staff. If you bring a motorcycle, it is the ideal place to visit Sanlúcar, Chipiona, El Puerto de Santa María, Rota, and Jerez de la Frontera. Restaurants, Bars, and grocery store, very close. Beach a hundred meters from the area."
17963,1171649,5,aguvale,10/04/2021,"It is one of the best areas that I have visited, very large plots and with all services. Alfonso the owner is super friendly and informs you of everything you need. I totally recommend it."
17963,1167800,3,ferlojo,05/04/2021,"I have repeated on several occasions, and the truth is that it is good, points to improve would be that it accepted reservations and that the electricity was with more power and a little cheaper ..."
17963,1161783,2,SebaBenitez,31/03/2021,"I simply do not recommend it, an area in a wonderful place and that keeps it open, because there is no other type of maintenance; With hardly any points of light, services and signaling of plots (good bricks that are not seen and destroy the ground, be careful!) ..."
17963,1161763,1,Migueldelgado,31/03/2021,"The only good thing about it is the site. This Alfonso is very unpleasant and has no idea how to run this type of business. It is a shame that to take a plot you have to stand guard and run away so that it is not taken from you. Hygiene services are scarce and regular. To hallucinate, he emphasizes that you pay in cash so that the Junta de Andalucía does not take away the subsidy it has for COVID."
17963,1157360,5,AntonioBerjano,25/03/2021,A very good area to spend a few days. The area is very nice and improving in terms of grass areas. Bike lanes to get to Chipiona and San Lucar easily. The only thing was the beach that for us was not attractive but as I say by bike you can get where you want and easily.
17963,1155734,4,mara78,22/03/2021,"Good area, very friendly owner and great facilities"
17963,1154813,5,Himalaya13,21/03/2021,"What a great place this is! An authentic piece of Spanish coast without high buildings with plenty of life in nature. Close to a nice cycle path to Chipiona and you can also easily cycle to Sanlúcar. The pitches are spacious and green, a pleasure to stand. The large lawn is wonderfully spacious to stand on during the week, but if you like some privacy make sure you find another spot on the campsite before the weekend, because at the weekend the whole field fills up with partying Spaniards, each unused use the spot. Alfonso is very hospitable and will help you with whatever is needed. We will come back again for sure."
17963,1151714,5,oscar106,14/03/2021,"Quiet and comfortable, good service"

17963,1150471,5,Stephye,12/03/2021,Excellent sanitary pk at the top. everything is perfect. just a bit far from everything except the beach
17963,1148351,2,Regina65,07/03/2021,"The pitch itself deserves maybe 5 stars, very friendly staff, quite clean, reasonable price. However, the environment is not nice. Trash, ruins, poor yapping dogs and the beach is not pretty. If you want to run nicely with the dog, this is the wrong place. I didn't stay."
17963,1147965,5,vavagogo,07/03/2021,We stayed a couple of days. 2 steps from the sea and in an area that we liked very much. honest price and very nice place. kind owner and also his German assistant a character! 100% recommend.
17963,1143474,3,Ludisen,27/02/2021,"The area is great, although it is a meeting place for groups of motorhomes and they are quite noisy. Alfonso (the owner) a charm."
17963,1143288,4,PinaColadaLiebe,27/02/2021,"Large space with level parking spaces framed by hedges, which offer privacy; clean sanitary facilities in containers; Shower 3 min = € 0.50; Washing machine = € 3; covered clotheslines are great; Owner & fellow campers very friendly; The surroundings are not so nice, even if the natural beach is just around the corner; the place fills up at the weekend; 8 € / night including W-LAN, but without electricity"
17963,1132014,5,Ben.campervan,21/01/2021,Incredibly friendly owner. Spacious pitches and a nice shower. Good price.
17963,1131419,5,secret4freedom,18/01/2021,"We thought the place was great ... Very personable owner, large & hot showers, bread delivery to the place and everything was very uncomplicated. You can also buy chemicals for the toilet. We would come back in a heartbeat. Thanks.!"
17963,1129671,3,hwneumann,10/01/2021,"Really a pleasant place, enough space, a very friendly owner, the beach is just around the corner. The supply and disposal is okay, as are toilets and showers (50 cents / 3 minutes). Horsefoot is only the extremely weak power supply (3 EU / day). With only 4 amps, not even the lowest level of a small fan heater is possible, which is why you have to heat with gas around the clock these days. I am also shocked that at least half of the people here do not give a damn about any Corona protective measures, no masks, no distance (except for the owner, because he is exemplary), so I often have to flee from others."
17963,1129209,4,Casiaris,08/01/2021,"Great to rest, the beach next to it is made of stones. We were going to stay one day and we stayed 3. Alfonso very kind helped us in everything. And the very kind people, we had a mishap with the AC and right away a guy helped us. Price € 8 overnight with emptying and filling included. Light apart. Showers, 50 cents 3 minutes, my daughter and I long hair € 1 each took a shower. we recommend."

17963,1124665,5,Babichdek,28/12/2020,"A great Home services are top the price is very reasonable. Emptying cassette and gray water. Free water. Located next to the beach. Very large place 100 m2 with grass. We can help ourselves milk, coffee, wine and products for the Cc. Gas etc. Washing machine and a large covered clothes rack with clotheslines available Everything was perfect to recommend."

17963,1107757,5,Angelobusse,27/10/2020,"The location of this area, the state and the service it provides, is very close to being unbeatable. The manager apart from being a great and sociable person, cares about giving you information. The site is very quiet and transmits a lot of peace. My intention was one day and I stayed three; very possibly return. Located between Sanlucar and Chipiona, the two enclaves are interesting to see and enjoy their gastronomy. The documentation issue is already solved and is open."
17963,1105645,5,LYO1,25/10/2020,When we were there there were few people and you could choose a plot. We were in a fairly spacious one with grass and shrubs that gave privacy. It was the manager himself who recommended it to us and he was right. Very friendly and concerned that we have a good stay. He gave us good recommendations for the next few days. Very very clean toilets and showers. We will be back
17963,1096563,2,jtoledo37,17/10/2020,"We went yesterday and it was closed, he came out to explain, a shame we had to improvise and the Chipiona area was also closed. We were disappointed."

In the VIP area, the services are not worthy either, gray water, sink, bathrooms ... can be improved. Nor does the kindness of those responsible make it better."

17963,1071871,3,virlyeuca,27/09/2020,"More than a beach, it is a coastal area inaccessible for swimming. The pitches are fine but the place to empty, fill and clean could be much better."

17963,1007225,2,GeorgeSoff,27/08/2020,"The pitches are generous and we had one with grass, but very very few shades. The toilets are somewhat old brick huts and with the sun it was very hot. The showers were very new but the hot water could not be regulated (there was no option to cold, which with the heat it was doing would have been appreciated). In the morning there was hardly any water in the taps to load tanks, bathrooms etc ..."
17963,995485,3,guirehi,23/08/2020,"PROS: Large area, with some grass pitches (some not). Near the beach with warm water. Large pitches. A good chiringuito with take away food next to it. The door always open. Washing machine (but very small, € 3). You can do whatever you want on your plot. Although it has no shadows, we have not been hot in August, a very good breeze. CONS: The emptying and filling system is crappy and poorly located. The beach is very bad: At low tide you can't see the water and there is a scree in between. On the high seas there is almost no beach and it hits hard. The payment is in cash and if you do not have they send you ""to the center of Sanlúcar"" which is 5 km away. (without giving more details). It does not have a dryer although there is a clothesline and ropes. If you do not catch grass, you are in a rocky area. Sanlúcar is very far and it is not easy to park. Walking you have to go by road, although I think there is a bus stop nearby. The power of light is limited and if it is very full you do not catch, and if you catch very little power."
17963,985145,4,Dxt,20/08/2020,"We have had a great night, it has a beach where you can bathe and a beach bar for lunch or dinner. all perfect"
17963,984710,1,pintado080,20/08/2020,"It is not an ac area, it is a seedy campsite. The grass area is under reservation, if you are passing through, it is not for you. There is no shadow. There is no beach; at low tide there is a small strip of land, but everything is dirty by the mouth of sewers. How is it possible that this site has 4 stars?"
17963,984335,3,Colchoneta,20/08/2020,"Area that is ""between good and evil."" Large area, 50 meters from a beach where you have to go with booties because it is very stony at its entrance to the sea, and in which the water will never cover you despite walking and walking. It is an area that allows caravans, therefore there are long-term staff (hence what looks like a campsite). It does not have light power for everyone and if you are lucky enough to get hooked, you only have 3 amps or a maximum of 700w of hook (no vitro, no dryer, no iron ...). The stay is € 12 and the down payment to light € 3 more (day). They close the washing machine module at 20:00. It only has two dishwashing sinks and a laundry sink. As well as only 3 showers and 2 toilets. Little equipment for the capacity of the area. That's why ... between good and evil, because the grass in your fish tank is cool ... but the rest ..."
17963,981464,5,asiererci,19/08/2020,"Great with greenway to move to Chipiona and 5km to Dan Lucas de Barrameda. The beach 50 meters with mmuu hot water and a beach bar in front, so they say very cheap. we have not tested it. It's great."
17963,966328,4,Adri2020,15/08/2020,If you play grass well but much dust. Close to Chipiona and quiet. There is no paper in the toilet and the showers are paid per minute (€ 0.50 = 3min / € 1 = 6min).
17963,960316,5,Yoko77,13/08/2020,"Very well located between Sanlucar and Chipiona, it is easily accessed by bicycle. It has all the services, shower, toilet, filling, emptying ... personally I like the gravel area more because it has more space, the other area is more similar to camping pitches. Super friendly owner. The beach next door has a very nice beach bar and a bar where you can eat very good tapas."
17963,958199,4,elandresvk,13/08/2020,"Area to spend one or two nights with all services. It has very good pitches, all occupied by motorhomes that seemed to be fixed and others not so good for people passing through. Correct showers and toilets. You can walk to the beach, although it is not very good. It has a beach bar that is highly recommended. It takes 1 hour to walk to San Lucar"
17963,957643,2,guau,13/08/2020,"If it's your turn, boil well, if you don't have to park at the bottom and there is a lot of sand and dust. There is no electricity in that area. Bus to Sanlucar and bike path to Chipiona which is very good to go with children. We did not like the area, muddy beaches and it smells very bad of fecal waters. The beach is next door but it's awful for swimming. We left. You can go to that beach with dogs. The chiringuito is very good and you have a beautiful sunset. They do not accept payment cards, which makes me very angry because it gives me that they will declare what I tell you ..."
17963,957128,3,calichy,13/08/2020,"We were on a plot without electricity or grass on land, there were no other places left. Correct attention. I join the two previous comments. To go to Sanlucar we took a comfortable bus stop at 300 meters. 1.10 the way and leaves you in the same center. Advisable to take it. To spend a couple of days"
17963,953856,2,CristinaT.,12/08/2020,"There is a lot of difference between plots of grass with hedges and those with gravel, they have weeds, little privacy, in the area there is not much to see, labyrinths of streets with houses, a beach with rocky soil and it does not cover even if you go 500m, cloudy water. On the other hand it is cheap, it has showers, toilets, sinks, washing machines, and emptying and filling of tanks. To spend a couple of nights is fine."

Adequate services, change of waters, showers, washing machines, laundries, etc. A small inconvenience - that's why I score with 4 stars - we could not use electricity because it was very full and according to them, there was not enough for everyone. If it is true that he asked if electricity was a problem, which is not for us, but he should hire more for consumption in the summer. We have spent some very pleasant days, quiet and without noise. The supermarkets are removed (4 km) but there are restaurants next to the beach and a grocery store in the surroundings."

17963,768803,3,johnandkellie,15/01/2020,"Two people and RV is 8 euros with no power in low season. Cash only.  Plots are not 100sqm like noted, because many people park closer.  There is a fair amount of grass, but many sites have a fair amount of dirt. You can move to another place if someone moves.   Electricity is 2euros but it is “3A”, no cooking allowed, and it is 190-210volts, and no earth connection.  Electricity is not guarenteed, and you need permission first, you can ask again each day. They are always counting how many are used. 

If you unplug from this electricity then you must tell them right away if you don’t want to keep paying for it.  Telling them a little later is not ok. We thought we were helping them (and others) when we stopped using it, but we had to pay for more days electricity than we used. 

The beach really is 50m away. Very close. You can hear the waves sometimes from the RV site.  When it is high tide there is not enough beach to walk or enjoy.  At low tide (and medium tide) it is very far out and great for walking (and you can see the stone “tide fish traps” further up the beach).  There is also a bar/cafe past the fish traps.  Its not really a swimming beach.  

Pay on checkout.  When we paid they tried to charge us for 5 days, but we stayed 4 nights, less than 4 x24hrs. Perhaps it was an honest mistake, be careful. 

I dont think we met the mentioned friendly Alfonzo.  We met two other guys, who were not particularly friendly.  They do know some english and they get the job done though. 

There are 4 obvious cameras located near the gate and the sign on the gate say that the gate is   closed overnight, not sure about the hours. 

Great place to stay and cycle in to the two towns each side.  Also there is a bus to Sanlucas. 

We didnt use the bathrooms or showers.  The washing machine works ok if you dont overload it.  Its on the smaller side. They have a large (free) “drying room” instead of a dryer, and you can also hang your own rope if you find a suitable place. 

Fresh water was very good and with good pressure. Grey and wc facilities are top notch in my opinion.  The wifi is very fast at some times of the day, closer to reception.  Very slow (but works) after 4pm. Wifi didn’t by work for us at the gate end of the area."

17963,593975,4,Txipironera8912,02/08/2019,"The area is very cool, the area with large plots, pay showers. The surroundings quite dirty. A shame Very nice owners. Theme of noise at night .... It looks like a campsite and there are many children playing and screaming ... But I guess it will be normal. To see a preferable movie more tranquility."
17963,579125,2,meinlifestylebusiness,27/07/2019,"The environment is very dirty and the sea is not for swimming, as mainly low tide and mud. The place itself is pretty noisy and everywhere it smells like grill lighter. There are many families with caravans there who talk loudly about the whole place. For us that is absolutely nothing, even with two children, we leave the next day. Electricity is not available, sold out!"
17963,573388,5,McLouis535G,24/07/2019,"A great area, correct services and really friendly staff. The beach that is right next door is not worth much for bathing, very low tide that does not allow it. But at 2km there is the beach of Montijo, very good for swimming, but if the tide is very high there is no sand! I recommend going by bike, because the road to the beach has not a single shadow, and it's all on asphalt. Green way very comfortable to visit Chipiona. The worst of everything left in the area, garbage everywhere and a lot of dirt ... a real shame, the horrible image it gives! A ZERO for the City of Sanlúcar."
17963,563885,3,Doralaexploradora,20/07/2019,Perfect place to visit the area. Large plots and lawn area. Very friendly owners. Something noisy by the noch for my taste should be respected quiet time.
17963,558738,5,txap,17/07/2019,"Very good place, there are plots with hedges around that give a lot of privacy. Good showers A few meters from a small beach. 100% recommendable!!"
17963,555834,4,caroste1,15/07/2019,The surroundings are horrible but the parking has perfect camping car. it's blessed in a very complicated area for car campsites. we were so happy to find such a place between Seville and Cadiz
17963,555383,5,pamsa,15/07/2019,"Very good place to rest, disconnect, and enjoy the site. The beach is rocky, but it is perfect for running, as it has very hard sand. At 500 meters, there is a greenway, which is accessed without any danger, both cycling and running, almost to Rota, so you can practice sports perfectly. A totally recommendable area ...."
17963,551218,5,danigg,13/07/2019,"Good area, with plots with lawn and very nice staff. but it is the area in which it is located (very dirty streets and beach) the area itself is perfect but the surrounding areas are horrible"
17963,536330,5,Gorky13,02/07/2019,"Good area of Motorhomes, we went Four nights with a camper and very well. The plots are spacious with green area. Many are bounded by hedges. Prices as already mentioned 12 euros in high season we were + 3 euros of electricity that we only use a day, why do not we need more. Well prepared with bathrooms and the showers are with timer with time slots, but they are enough: with 1 € time of 6 minutes, To shower 4 to spare."
17963,534456,5,Sportman55,30/06/2019,"Area with very wide and beautiful squares, on grass or with grass fence. Very complete area with all the necessary services, next to the beach and near the center of Sanlúcar by bus (15min) where you eat very well. Alfonso very attentive at all times and helpful to our questions. Wifi a little slow but without problems with the power of electricity. We will repeat, we were 26 June"
17963,531889,2,JeffKLunn,28/06/2019,"This is to all intents and purposes a small basic campsite full of caravans and Spanish families which is great if that is what you want, if not look elsewhere. The owners Alfonso and Pedro seem genuinely helpful and pleased to see you, however if you want electric you need to be Spanish. We were told that none was available but ask tomorrow, asked tomorrow same answer but at each side of us a caravan and motorhome arrived a day later and were hooked up to the bollard in front of our pitch, when I questioned why I was told they had phoned and booked the electric..!! We left the next day as for 12 euros a night without electric we can do a lot better, plus basic toilets and showers (at extra cost) and WiFi that didn’t work added to noisy site made our minds up, you can come and make your mind up but we do not recommend."
17963,515397,5,saraflores04,14/06/2019,"We spent 2 very quiet nights, with a bar next door, gaspar house that eats very well. Alfonso very attentive and we oriented us very well on where to eat or dine in chipiona and in sanlucar."
17963,511184,5,Marengo,10/06/2019,"Nice place, owner Alfonso is a super friendly guy and very welcoming. Perfect to visit Sanlucar, close to the beach. Simple but clean facilities."

17963,473025,4,Laruski,01/05/2019,"Private caravan area near the sea (near access and possibility of green way to chipiona). They are parcels separated by hedges with a certain privacy (two cabins / AC per plot, with small garden for each one). 10 euros without electricity and separate shower! (Time dependent, for 50 cents decent shower). Noise: Dog barking, some car, and plane? Not much, but not some noise. For vans I would only go if you need services (potty, filling, emptying included in the price) and you fancy a good shower."
17963,469473,4,Rangie,27/04/2019,"Basic and simple, but nice !"

17963,466107,3,ikirmai77,24/04/2019,"Zerbitzu guziak dituen tokia. Pena da ingurua zikina eta utzia dagoela. San Lucarrea bus joan daiteke eta Chipionaruntz ""via verde"" ateratzen da bertatik. Very good area with all services. A shame the surroundings, should be taken care of more. There is a bus to San Lucar and greenway that connects with Chipiona."
17963,462778,4,join,21/04/2019,"Very good area, Alfonso the boss very attentive, very quiet, bathrooms, showers, washing machine, .. near the beach but not worth to bathe.The municipality of San Lucar has to clean the surroundings."
17963,455921,3,laurafer,15/04/2019,"The area is very correct, grass plots, some with privacy. Filling and emptying very comfortable. It has showers and sinks. The environment fails, you have to take the bus to the town and the beach on foot."
17963,453667,4,brammers,13/04/2019,"Lovely place on an old campsite. Spacious and clean with grassy, hedge delimited pitches. I didn't use the toilets or however the washing machine worked fine. The downside is that the immediate area is a little run down and the beach is littered with rubbish. Friendly managers."
17963,442730,5,Mizdo,21/03/2019,I put 5 stars because I can not 6. Fabulous area and Alfonso and daughter of 10. We will enjoy the place again
17963,441539,4,fendetestas,18/03/2019,Fantastic site We went for two nights and we stayed five. Very friendly staff and price 8 euros plus 2 for electricity
17963,437644,4,Vandiamo,08/03/2019,"Great site right by the beach. Well tended, laid out, decent sized pitches. All facilities including laundry & unique drying room (ie greenhouse!) we paid €10 inc elec. dogs barked but earplugs did the trick"
17963,436228,4,dey_mrw,04/03/2019,"We arrived on Saturday and left on Monday, € 16 you have all the services and the plots are very good, with grass and quite large to be an area. To put some stick is that they have restricted the light to 3 amps and in summer because you can not put the air. I have not even hired Luz because I have not needed it, the owner and worker very attentive and the place very quiet, 50m from the beach. If we return to the area, we will repeat for sure."
17963,431902,4,stellape,21/02/2019,"8 euros low season for large plot, electricity extra.  Peaceful. Clean. Friendly and helpful staff. Lovely 5k walk along beach to Sanlucar (or bus). shops, bars etc locally.  Excellent value. We have spent 10 days here."
17963,428644,2,fidelecastor,12/02/2019,"On the positive side: Alfonso is a very good host, his rates are very reasonable for a site by the sea, its location is spacious and the wifi is good. Negative side: The sea yes but not at any price: The street that leads to the land is equipped with a sewer in the open air that flows directly into the sea with more waste of building materials next to the beach. The surrounding houses are more like a slum with a majority of corrugated iron and dirt. In addition, the river Guadalquivir flows into the sea here. So how do you want to stay in this place and swim in a place like this? Our opinion is certainly influenced by the fact that we were just before in one of the most beautiful villages of Spain: Vejer de la Frontera where we had exactly opposite characteristics to this site (only 60 km from here)."
17963,423414,5,saimaggi,19/01/2019,"A place to repeat !!! Alfonso, the person in charge, is suuuuuuuper attentive !!! Many facilities!!! The only but, is that the power of La Luz is short ... but has some plots that would like to have the first category campsites! They have treated us super well !!! Thank you!!!!"
17963,416106,5,paulogato,26/12/2018,Very good to be with friends or rest has plenty of space
17963,415134,4,Hannelore40,20/12/2018,"Great place. Alfonso is a great guy. His employee of the weekend, Pepe is also a great boy. We have been there since the 14th and we came back to see friends, met last year, and to celebrate the 31st of the year with all the caravan campers present that night. Organized by Alfonso, very good evening guarantee."
17963,413842,2,vanlifebuilds,12/12/2018,You can not use the showers paying part. Only for clients ... The owners did not seem as friendly as other comments say
17963,397268,4,rauls,22/10/2018,"The area is very good. It has bathrooms and the showers are with money. But for 1 euro or less you have plenty. It is very spacious. He sleeps very quiet and without noise. The owner and the employees are very friendly. The only ""but"" you have is the issue of electricity, which only let you connect TV and things that consume little because they skip the light."
17963,397076,4,air7,22/10/2018,"Interesting place... - good for getting some rest passing through and having a quiet night, but...
The environment and the beach are not pretty. Electricity is limited to 3A - with electric cooking, heating etc prohibited. 3 simple showers (in total = 1EUR /6min), 2 toilets men, 2 toilets women, no lavatory with mirror, power outlet (shaving etc).
The places are spacious/nice, friendly reception!"

17963,382974,4,GuillBel,27/09/2018,"Area that nothing would have to envy to some camping, except the baths and the showers. The showers are paid, but with € 1 enough for a woman hair and everything. Very quiet, private plots and second line beach."
17963,378293,5,AlexanderJ,20/09/2018,Super nice place with a lot of passion from the owner. Clean toilets and showers. Great pitches on lawn.

17963,372000,4,betita82,12/09/2018,"We were going for one day and we stayed two. In the area it was very good. The beach next door is not beautiful but for children it is ideal. It's fine ... water with a pleasant temperature and no waves. It is true that the surroundings are dirty, but not the area. It has the lawn and the services that they offer clean and cared for. Alfonso, the person who takes it, tb very well, nice, attentive to the needs and recommending tb restaurants that we enjoyed a lot."
17963,360812,5,tripax,31/08/2018,"The best area in which we have been this vacation (zone Huelva / Zona Cadiz) Near the very quiet beach, lawn in the plots, spacious plots and Alfonso very attentive. A 10."
17963,359608,4,lluis7,30/08/2018,Large plots with lawn. Very quiet place with super friendly staff. Prices more than reasonable. Recommended with a remarkable height.
17963,336776,3,xavicapdevila,16/08/2018,"The plots are very well all with grass, the only light is not insured and the beach is made of stones"
17963,332147,5,maitaitxi,13/08/2018,"Without a doubt, the best area we've been to. The environment is beautiful and the attention of those in charge perfect. If we go back to Sanlucar we will not hesitate to come back here."
17963,328878,5,merchuka,12/08/2018,The area great but we did not stay because the beach is rocky marsh type
17963,324445,5,gaudinem,10/08/2018,"Superb motorhome area, Alfonso very nice and nice. Well located, well defined areas are green, shaded and all for a reasonable price, some areas should be an example."

17963,295853,1,mimijoni,21/07/2018,"We were going to go this August 8 days, but the owner told me he does not assure me that he has electricity, and in case he had it, I can not connect the dometic air. The worst thing is not that, it's that he said it in bad manners. We certainly will not go to this area, there are many more options."
17963,280406,3,sportvolley,04/07/2018,"Nice space for motorhomes. There are all the services. The owner is friendly and speaks a little French. There are delimited spaces with grass and hedges. The beach is near. The sea is warm, but it has wind and green algae. There is a bus line 3 which passes 500 m to the left of the campsite next to a small roundabout. It's not a 4 star but it's ok."
17963,278755,5,titomon,01/07/2018,"We just spent a nice weekend in this area, and we have been in luxury. An owner who treats you as if he knew you all your life, a square with grass, € 8 low season, 10 medium and 12 high, light separately. The showers are for a fee. The beach is just a step away from the rocks, but at 1km and a half of a walk to Chipiona you will arrive at a very cool beach. The tides and the sunset are incredible."
17963,267682,5,Porto4,13/06/2018,"Can we highly recommend. Although not the prettiest area, the pitch and Alfonso make up for it. Pitch, which is more like a campsite. Large plots, showers, WC, washing machine, Ver. And disposal, W-Lan. A few steps to the sea and everything else you need in less than 4 km distance. Prices unbeatable in the NS."
17963,258988,3,ronacasey,25/05/2018,Stayed 2 nights. Grass pitches which are unusual in Spain . Great welcome from Alfonso. Nice stop over. Bus into Sanlucar for good Tapas and shops .

17963,218386,2,mellish,10/01/2018,Best thing about this site was the good and free wifi connection.  Toilets and shower(pay for use) were dilapidated although functional as was the Chem toilet and waste water dump point.  2 supermarkets within walking distance but both had limited stock.  Beach was bad with lots of rubbish and no sand but oily mud.  Not good for dogs.  That said several units were overwintering here.

17963,204468,5,marokko,20/10/2017,"Great place, with lots of lawn, free WiFi, very friendly owner, close to the city and right on the beach, you can only swim at high tide, walking is very nice at low tide. The price is very good at 7 euros for a week of use. Electricity 2 euros per day."
17963,203209,3,IPalma,15/10/2017,So normal. € 8 without electricity. The good thing is that you can take a few small plots in which the children are perfect and controlled. The bad thing is that the Wifi did not reach where we were. The bathrooms very run down and the hot water runs out. Far from town. The beach is nice to walk around at low tide and you can only swim at high tide.
17963,202014,5,Martins,11/10/2017,15/8 Area with grassy overnight area. A luxury for the area.

17963,195984,4,Bauti,20/09/2017,We are in luxury for the treatment and for how well cared for it is. The bad thing is the beach and the public bus (with a cadence of almost 1 hour) although Alfonso very kindly invited us to go to town with his car hehehe.
17963,195933,5,antoniomiramiralles,20/09/2017,Perfect for the price and above all the kindness of the owner Alfonso who knows more where to eat than the Michelin guide I will return

17963,190048,5,txitowin,05/09/2017,"The caravan area with manicured grass is very good, the atmosphere exudes confidence, cameras recording and attentive staff. The facilities are basic but it is almost a campsite for €12 with electricity and wifi. They are making more new showers, the effort to improve is evident. They advise you well and offer to explain areas to visit."
17963,189607,1,aresyhera,03/09/2017,"The terrible treatment, even without getting very badly attended. They don't understand arriving at 11:30 PM.

17963,162387,4,centrodelsur,31/07/2017,"Great area, you have showers, toilets and the rest of the services. The charming owner, good knowledge of the environment and willing to help. When we arrived he asked us about our expectations (beach, gastronomy, etc.) and gave us perfect advice. Bus close to Sanlúcar center, return by taxi about 9 euros. The reason for not giving it 5 stars is because the nearby beach is horrible."
17963,160866,5,jalomur,30/07/2017,"Sanlucar de Barrameda. Large plots of well-kept lawns. Tranquillity. Bars nearby, Burn eat. Beach 50m away. At full tide you can swim, at low tide better for walking. Near Sanlúcar."
17963,140385,4,jeanot29260,03/06/2017,"Very warm welcome from Alphonso ☺. as a good professional, he is very often in the area, always listening to his customers, large surface area of plots, all grassy, 3A electricity (a little weak, but in this period, that's enough) toilets and showers a little outdated but clean."

Spacious and grassy pitches, rustic but clean and sufficient showers and toilets, a decent beach right next door facing Donana Park, the kindness of the boss Alfonso, the unbeatable price (wifi, electricity, 2 nights, €20): recommended ! possibility of taking the boat from Rota to Cadiz, or from Sanlucar to Donana Park."

17963,118398,5,Acgg,15/01/2017,Very good and cheap... €8 per vehicle...
17963,111563,4,fld,26/10/2016,Great place rustic installation but totally functional to recommend
17963,106447,5,joint56,21/09/2016,Small beach 50 m away (wait for high tide). Great welcome from Alfonso on clean and well-landscaped grounds. Close to shops. 3 days for 24 euros
17963,104291,5,pierrot35,10/09/2016,"Super friendly welcome in French. Although some installations may seem rustic, they work, which is the most important thing, and before being campervans, we are first and foremost “backpackers”. Thanks again for the welcome Alfonso. Area to recommend, do not hesitate to go to the end of the path to find the area."
17963,100476,4,cesarbracho,27/08/2016,"Good place Alfonso, the owner, the best, informs you about everything there is in the surroundings, everything is very quiet, very familiar, only that the beach is for the little ones because the low tide leaves a k of shore but very beautiful"
17963,96781,3,MAXOU199,18/08/2016,Nice place but nothing nearby. All services perfect for a stopover.
17963,92373,4,Siria26,10/08/2016,Good site! Large plots with grass. The owner is very very nice. The beach is very horizontal so when the tide goes out you have to walk a lot to swim but at high tide it is perfect. Beautiful sunsets from the beach bar right there
17963,90537,4,clemjenni,07/08/2016,"Arriving at 11 p.m., access was open and free to park. In the early morning meeting with Alfonso, the very kind and welcoming manager. 10 € per night instead of 12 € because we parked in the car park and not on a spot with grass. In the immediate vicinity of the beach. Family campervan area with shower and toilet, rustic but clean."
17963,85644,4,Marco95,26/07/2016,"Very nice grass camper area. Really warm welcome, basic but perfectly adequate toilets and showers and even a ""dishwashing"" area. The ocean is 50 m from the entrance. The price is very reasonable: - €8 in low season - €10 in mid season (we were there on 07/25!!!) - €12 in high season and €2 for electricity (5 amp) Only downside: a lot dogs around and inevitably barking."
17963,71431,4,benimark,05/05/2016,"Great spot stone throw from beach, nice & quiet, very good services & helpful friendly attendant, all services & reasonable price, good bar nearby"

17963,66330,4,jorgeb,26/03/2016,"Large grass plots. Very calm. Next to the beach, not suitable for bathing. Nearby there is a supermarket, bars and buses to go to Sanlucar. There is a bar where you can buy churros for breakfast."
17963,66038,5,promanito,23/03/2016,Very good site. The only downside is that not all plots have an electrical outlet.
17963,65440,5,Dreidi,14/03/2016,"We were here for four weeks. Actually it speaks for itself. Alfonso, the operator, has become a good friend to us. The place is well maintained and is centrally located between two typical Spanish towns. Thank you for the hospitality."
17963,61143,4,madder,18/12/2015,"Very quiet area with fairly large plots, with Wi-Fi and at a good price. Nearby greenway for bike routes. The beach is not too good for swimming."
17963,57319,4,gloombuster,11/10/2015,"A wonderful Camperstop with a very friendly owner who goes out of his way to be helpful. (Alfonso). Tapas bar, mini general store nearby. Great cycling on the Vias Verde nearby. Would definitely return. Good wifi and electrics."
17963,48436,4,cnfa,12/08/2015,Good place to stay one night. We paied 6 € for the night including wireless and eletricity. Lots of caravans where there at 11/08/2015.
17963,40805,3,amigos,05/07/2015,"The beach almost at our feet. Facilities on green grass (a luxury). Rather rudimentary sanitary facilities. But unbeatable price €15 in high season for a large demarcated place with electricity, services and wifi. We will come back."
17963,36974,3,Pinasho,18/05/2015,"Good place, the only thing is that to be able to go to a proper beach you have to go to the Chipiona part. One drawback is that the water in the showers is not hot because the water heaters are electric and are not enough."
17963,33083,4,pheclaf,06/04/2015,"Quiet parking (when the dogs are quiet) and friendly. The sanitary facilities are basic but very correct. Wireless. Beach and shops nearby, very warm welcome."

17963,30378,3,coulou,03/01/2015,"The pitches are spacious, 8 euros, location and services including wifi, but electricity in addition 2 euros for 5 amps. The only downside, the neighborhood dogs at night!"
18020,3288876,2,zntx,12/09/2023,Are we talking about the acorns that fall on the roof night and day? I won't tell you about the jumps with the noise it makes... I don't know how you cope with that.
18020,3284636,4,Wambitos,11/09/2023,"We spent the night here, it was dark and raining a lot so at first it didn't seem like the most exciting place, but when we saw all the Campers and motorhomes there were (about 20 in total) we decided to stay. Everything was great except for music that was heard until late at night and I don't know if it was a disco, terrace or something."
18020,3266939,5,Ricondo,07/09/2023,The parking lot is perfectly located to go up to the sanctuary.

18020,3166597,5,AinLa,17/08/2023,Highly recommended place to sleep. Parking with shadows and tables and chairs. Far from the city but perfect location to visit the sanctuary. At 50m is the funicular to go up. It costs €3 round trip and only €2 one way. There is also a bus that takes you to Braga if you want.
18020,3163637,5,Fovemove,16/08/2023,"Very good for the visit, and the surprise at the top of the park if you continue past the shrine. Too bad some take this area for a campsite by taking out their clothes to dry and their awnings."
18020,3157311,4,jguahe1,16/08/2023,"Good place to spend the night, crowded with cars during the day, after 7:00 p.m., at least in summer, only AC and campers, a fountain in the same parking lot, tables and picnic areas, yes, there is noise at nightfall but after midnight night became very quiet"
18020,3155799,4,jumiclea,15/08/2023,"Good parking for walking around Bom Jesus. The parking lot is big but there are a lot of cars. For motorhomes, it's hard to find a place on busy days. It is best to arrive after 6:00 p.m. to find space. The visit is worth the detour."
18020,3140383,4,jordiadrian,13/08/2023,Quiet place to sleep if you are in the area. Many motorhomes and plenty of shady spots. Perfect for visiting bom jesús do monte.

18020,3053138,5,Txivero,31/07/2023,"Good parking to start the visit to Bono Jesús. It has large trees, with shadows. It has wide squares, and the winged funicular. Although we decided to walk up and down. A beautiful site."
18020,3048936,5,alaznearteaga,31/07/2023,"Very quiet and perfect parking to spend the night. It has a source of drinking water and garbage, as well as a small bar that opens in the morning.

18020,2957920,4,alexkosi,13/07/2023,"Great for the Bom Jesus visit. We stayed one night here. The street next door was a bit noisy but perfectly fine for one night. The police drove by in the morning, but didn't stop."
18020,2936641,5,GasparAttila,08/07/2023,Very close to the funicular and the stairs as well. Great position for walking and running as well. Lot's of motorhome stayed here but it was calm and quiet.
18020,2909634,5,sabrinazota,30/06/2023,Good address. 100 meters from the bus stop nr. 2 that for 1.5 euros takes you to the city center. From the same place there are the stairs or funicular to go up to the sanctuary. Quiet place with many parked motorhomes.

18020,2852685,4,GERALDINEJF,14/06/2023,"Good parking to visit Bom Jesus, if you want to go back and forth by funicular, take the ticket for 3€ directly. We were hampered by almost non-stop traffic all night, which is why I'm deducting one star. Good 4G reception, TV accessible on the pitches closest to the road. Several bars and ice cream parlors at Bom Jesus."

18020,2635063,5,Beiit,02/04/2023,Well level parking in general. We came here after being in several empty sites that did not convey confidence and there were already several caravans here when we arrived. Road with a bit of traffic but it doesn't bother. At night there are cars from people in the area but everything is quiet.
18020,2634459,5,maria250993,01/04/2023,"Very quiet area to spend the night. When we arrived it was already around 11 at night and there were already caravans and vans parked to spend the night there, which in a way gives more peace of mind. It is next to a road but the truth is that not many cars passed at night, besides that they were hardly heard. I recommend it 100%"
18020,2620028,4,spoony03,22/03/2023,"Correct locations. lots of tall trees and therefore no TV. part of the car park is under construction so surely noise in the morning on weekdays in the coming days. it's also like a lot of car parks on the outskirts of cities, a meeting point until late at night. but no problem for us. Very well placed for the beautiful visit, the surprising funicular or the stairs."
18020,2606659,4,Tempete2983,12/03/2023,"Parking under the trees outside the city where we spent the night in peace.

The road is not a problem as little traffic after 8 p.m. Unfortunately a group of young Spaniards arrived at 2am to eat and chat noisily right next to our mobile home! Too bad and bad luck...
18020,2061676,4,dolarshibapits,11/07/2022,"It is a parking without services, there was a fountain but it did not work, at night it was very quiet, in the morning there was already more noise from cars because it is in the middle of two roads. The place is perfect to get up early and go up to Bom Jesus do mount, you have the funicular 2 minutes away that they let in with dogs, there is a beach bar in the parking lot."
18020,2038721,3,jld272,04/07/2022,Space to park but also accessible to cars. Very close to the road so a bit noisy at night. Nevertheless very convenient to take the funicular 5 minutes away or the steps for the bravest to visit the sanctuary.

18020,1505289,3,Laveloz,24/08/2021,"Good place to go early to the mountain. Picnic tables, okay, but all somewhat dirty and neglected.

18020,993175,4,Neboa,22/08/2020,"Very well located to be near the Bom Jesús. Clean, cobblestone floor, with lots of native trees. Toilets next door. We were there on a Saturday and some girls agreed to celebrate a farewell and they were with music and dancing, but one does not get married every day."
18020,968949,3,lebeche,16/08/2020,Good location and quiet to spend the night. Many campers around. BEWARE of parking near the kiosk because the owner starts to wake up early with the water hose. Unpleasant sir because you need to take more space for your terrace. It's not even worth paying for a coffee. Otherwise all right.
