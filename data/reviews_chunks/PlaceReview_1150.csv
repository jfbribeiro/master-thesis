25700,2830505,4,jlr974,07/06/2023,"Very quiet night. Free water and electricity. Emptying toilet cassettes impossible, the evacuation is clogged. 3 motorhomes only at the beginning of June, in a huge place, with pitches almost all on a slope."
25700,2782317,4,PakitoCalvo,24/05/2023,"The area is very wide and long, well lit, with all services including light, with some shade, the Town is very beautiful and cozy, and mainly safe.

25700,2611068,4,Northwind,16/03/2023,"As described, a large parking lot on the edge of a nice old town. On Thursdays there is a market and from 6 a.m. things are set up. (As of March 2023)."
25700,2609068,3,bkb,14/03/2023,"Large, slightly sloping car park (blocks required). Dilapidated service terminal, blocked black water drain, therefore unusable. Electric sockets available along the wall, but I have a doubt if they are for us. Nothing mentions it. It looks more like a hacking of electrical boxes intended for the market. Very small historic center quickly visited. Quiet night."
25700,2583665,4,fvela,19/02/2023,"Large parking lot almost flat and lighted. There are pitches below that look nicer, quieter. Very convenient WIFI access. Ideal after the Ãlvao park and towards the Peneda Gérés park. Thank you to the municipality for the free services. downside: works and cars from 7am, there are a lot of dogs barking, and the service area looks abandoned even if quite clean."
25700,2580062,5,gert.van.werven,16/02/2023,Can't really get any better. nice village and all amenities free. On Thursday there is a market and then you have to move to the back (Wednesday evening) because building starts from 06.00.
25700,2576287,4,javeasteve5,13/02/2023,"Spent one Sunday night here with two other vehicles. Flat, illuminated, quiet and electric. Town very quiet after having huge Sunday Lunch. Maybe different in summer looking at wheelie skid marks but we would use again without hesitation."
25700,2513851,5,ronin40693,05/12/2022,"perfect place to spend the night. all services, including electricity, free, very spacious, in the heart of town.

25700,1985428,3,VanessaMauro,17/06/2022,"Local Fair Space close to the center, with all services for motorhomes free of charge, including electricity, although not all outlets are working. With few trees. Pay attention to the fair's calendar, unfortunately I don't know. We slept for two nights in June/22 and unfortunately on those days the black water disposal service was barely clogged."
25700,1984359,4,Coke83m,17/06/2022,Stayed there for one night at the end of May. everything was free. Beautiful old town within walking distance. There was electricity in junction boxes in the wall. Toilet disposal was also clogged with us.
25700,1966821,4,Dalakker,11/06/2022,"We stayed here at the end of May. The place is quiet, free electricity, shops and restaurants nearby, the old center is small but beautiful! Unfortunately, the toilet drain was clogged again immediately, although a city employee had cleared it. This is probably a constant problem, hence 4 stars. But a well-meant thank you to the city!"
25700,1957108,4,Fuzikipt,07/06/2022,"Well located area, right in the center of the city.. with free electricity, but not all the sockets were working... with gray and black water dumping and drinking water available, but unfortunately the waste disposal site was clogged. black waters. I believe it was a one-off problem and that's why we gave it four stars."

25700,1740937,3,LeBary,25/01/2022,"Large car park with water and cassette service. Impossible to drain on January 25, 2022 because the system was clogged. The parking lot is not sunny in the morning which makes waking up gloomy."
25700,1736503,4,Anniedidier,18/01/2022,"Stopover for one night, large car park used on market days, so free electricity in each large box, gray water drain, water tap. Attention to date the cassette drain is clogged, we could not use it. Quiet and in town."

25700,1705680,3,Tacu,07/12/2021,"Good initiative from the municipality to create this area. During the day its used as a car parking and with such a huge parking area people just park in front blocking the access to any motorhome that needs to change water. We stayed for the night but could not find a point of electricity working either. 
Village is very nice and friendly! Its worth a visit!"
25700,1637902,4,GenyalCamper,10/10/2021,"Given our first experience, we decided to rest here, on our trip to Andalusia. Same opinion as in June. Very quiet, although it was dirtier than the previous time."
25700,1504589,1,juju34,23/08/2021,Thank you to the municipality free electricity large quiet space not far from the city all for water WC services
25700,1492306,3,matildeBotelho,21/08/2021,"We slept on 18/08, the space is big and calm. It has a dump site and clean water. The only problem was that we had to leave was agreed and we had to leave at 5:45 in the morning because a fair was going to be set up at ASA. There was no notice about the fair, we learned from a local there is a fair on the first Thursday of and the last of each month. This fair was special for immigrants"
25700,1354494,4,Overtrail,23/07/2021,"The park is large and easily accessible and has all the facilities. It's not particularly pretty, but it's right next to the historic center and the slope isn't too steep. We've seen previous comments regarding groups of people coming here at night to make noise, but we stayed overnight without any problem or inconvenience. Thanks to the municipality!"
25700,1268054,4,GenyalCamper,21/06/2021,"Very calm. As much as to sleep on the pull. Of course it was from Sunday to Monday and it was raining. By the way, no sign of roosters or dogs. Recommended visit by town."
25700,1248098,5,GerbenR,11/06/2021,"Quiet place to stand, in the evening some dogs that barked, nothing else."
25700,1027288,2,joanapacheco72,05/09/2020,It’s a good Motorhome park. But it looks also a place to do other things by the locals( drugs?) until midnight a lot of cars go there for one or two minutes and than go away. After that we had a good night sleep.   It was a Saturday night maybe in other week days is diferente. Good for services.
25700,967649,4,Nachtrag,15/08/2020,"A nice place with nice restaurants and bistros! Place very clean, unfortunately a few young rowdies on motorcycles and barking dogs in the night!"
25700,782983,1,Monharevie,19/02/2020,"Although it is a big open space, dogs barked all night and the Cockerels crowed also, I managed to doze off at about 12:30, to be woke up by guys in cars at the back of my CC talking and laughing at 01:30, I was lucky if I got 2 hours sleep. We did manage to fill up with water and empty the Grey waste. Could not empty toilet because it was broken. Will definitely not be back."
25700,725678,3,Bulli_Camper,20/10/2019,"Very large public parking (about 200 seats), partly slightly sloping location, but overall rather straight orientation. In October we had a quiet night here. Sunday morning, however, was built for a local party - so the pitch may not always be available. Okay for one night."
25700,625424,1,Ponyexpress66,13/08/2019,Not staying to sleep: barking cocks constantly drifting traces on parking (photo 3).
25700,548944,5,jlnb,11/07/2019,Nothing to say. Thank you for the plan
25700,539677,3,LRcompetition,05/07/2019,Convenient and big but you have to stand the cocks and dogs all night long
25700,503272,4,Ala027,03/06/2019,Quiet place. Electricity and water available. Gray water drain possible. Free.
25700,442632,1,Mounette68,21/03/2019,"No water, dog abboiment all night, roosters singing at night, and morning unpacking for the market. Woke up at 5am."
25700,422668,3,luckyweilerbach,15/01/2019,"Water was not turned off in mid-January. Electricity available at several sockets. Wednesday is market day, so no overnight stay from Tuesday to Wednesday."
25700,422281,1,Heuchma,13/01/2019,"We went there but not stayed. Very dirty, no water."
25700,216295,3,amainafou,28/12/2017,Most closed electrical boxes. Comings and goings of young people in cars at night. But nothing really bad!
25700,173721,2,Oaklet,13/08/2017,Just a huge parking. We arrived Saturday after - post market apocalypse.. Someone was clearing all the rubbish but would have taken her until next week.. most of the spots aren't flat and electricity wasn't open.. Didnt stay.
25700,157343,5,david.annie,24/07/2017,We are there we have filled it is impossible to empty they are in preparation of celebration thank you to the common for this place free attention do not follow GPS coordinates for entrance entry impossible in motorhome

25741,1161690,1,zukitruki,31/03/2021,At 22 o'clock an environmental agent came and informed us that it is not possible to spend the night here.
25741,1086330,4,Caracolillos,08/10/2020,"Quiet place, asphalted and right at the beginning of the routes by the river cacin, chives and the table of Fornes! It is accessed by dirt track but flat, without services"
25741,848588,4,juanlo77,04/07/2020,"Quiet place to spend the night. Without services, level, with access by dirt road in good condition although somewhat narrow. It is better to arrive at the last minute so that they do not evict you."
25741,506578,5,zone13,07/06/2019,Very nice place quiet night little corner at the water's edge nickel
25743,2917172,1,Javi13,02/07/2023,"The swamp saved him, fortunately it is still there... Kampaoh has taken over the campsite... tents, tents and tents ready, the posturing begins, friends. The restaurant… there were 4 tables with diners, they asked us to wait an hour because they were full. Once they started serving us, it only took 40 minutes to bring out the first dish, and another 30 for the second..."
25743,2460394,3,lebeausergio,24/10/2022,Campsite empty at this time of the year everything is closed. Good and large campsite without demarcated pitches. Almost no water in the artificial lake. the heat wave also passed through here. On the other hand 9€ the electrical connection. very very expensive
25743,2299536,1,noelievd,25/08/2022,Expensive and unpleasant campsite. We paid 39e for one night with electricity. Noisy all evening with a screening of a film for children.
25743,2273719,3,sylwia.sisi,20/08/2022,"The campsite is nicely located, large, bathrooms ok. In the restaurant chaos, waiting a long time and we got raw pork. The beach by the lake is huge, the water in the lake is cold. 44 euro for a campervan and 3 people is probably a bit too much for such a place."
25743,2193754,5,Jongu28,07/08/2022,"Refurbished and very top campsite! There are no plots, but there is always room for everyone. Awesome campsite staff. Ideal for bike rides, canoeing, paddle, ... .. We will return for sure"
25743,2141472,4,emilyse,29/07/2022,"beautiful cp with free choice of space in the forest. very good pool and great shop, it is also right on the lake, where you can rent pedal boats etc. for €10 an hour. there are activities for children. for 2 adults, a van without electricity we paid about 66€ for 2 nights. Unfortunately, there was a youth group there during our stay, which was very loud in the evenings."
25743,2072967,3,Cucaneta,14/07/2022,"It is in a pine forest with irregular and sloping ground. Very hot during the day. It is not parceled out, so you have to find a good spot, which is not easy, although it was not overcrowded. It has a swimming pool and access to the reservoir with bathing allowed. A little expensive, but it's 1st category. The bathrooms, impeccable. Activities every day."
25743,2038334,2,Javi13,04/07/2022,"Pros: Access to swamp with beach Cons: Expensive and poorly maintained. Emptying of black: shabby and dirty, a hole where everything will come out, you will not be able to hose down to clean. Emptying: gray a grid next to the road, it will end up in the surrounding shops. It is a pine forest, there are shadows but it is dry and dusty. It is a continuous slope. In tent you will sleep on edges. expensive restaurant."
25743,1964390,2,peoplecalled,10/06/2022,38€ for a van and 2 adults is just too expensive for the campsite. The showers are a disaster.
25743,1645523,1,saultrafic,15/10/2021,"A simple pine forest very uneven with very old toilets and showers in which there is only a hanger to hang clothes, the gray emptying area there is no way that everything does not fall out of the drain. I will not return, the reception It seems that you owe them something when you give the data."
25743,1489215,4,Amayita,20/08/2021,"There is no Wi-Fi, the light sockets are distributed far and you need a lot of cable or extension cords. It is free camping, you need chocks since it has a slope. It has very good shade, a swimming pool with a bar, a restaurant and a small shop with good bread. The playground is pretty seedy. A great direct access to the lake, with rentals of pedaló, padlesurf ... perfect for a couple of days"
25743,1384339,1,Neobzn,30/07/2021,"An ugly forest without plots and uneven to the last corner. The receptionist unfriendly and did not explain anything to us, no services, or anything. The bathrooms are cleaned first thing in the morning when they are most requested and calmly ... one hour of cleaning and they would not let you in. Very expensive for what it offers. 1 Camper van and 1 person € 20, 1 van and 2 people € 27. Terrible in my opinion."
25743,1363486,2,IBueno,25/07/2021,"Free camping camping, the place for grays for the AC very bad, there is no way to pour the water inside and they tell you to stay in the middle of the road, (it smells terrible). Clean showers and toilets but a trickle of water and very old. The pool is fine, but the water is very dirty. Good for the activities. They should check the category of the campsite ..."
25743,1267872,3,Kittypreto,21/06/2021,Free camping site. Very well located but without much else. It is difficult to choose a square to be level. There are many fixed campers that have great beach bars set up. Correct bathrooms. Without pretentions.
25743,1117403,3,01012000,24/11/2020,"We were this summer, expensive, diaphanous camping and difficult to find a flat area, correct services but I don't understand why the fountains are closed for consumption and when we asked where we could get water they told us that it was possible in the sinks. On the other hand there is much to see in the area and the activities especially that of the incredible stars. Dogs are welcome."
25743,1108573,3,cloud400d,28/10/2020,"Nothing special. We spent the night just to be able to use the shower and they were very small, with just a mini heater and nowhere to rest our clothes. Quite shabby to pay € 30 for two adults + 1 child + van"
25743,1090995,4,Katrintxo,12/10/2020,"Very expensive, it is not intended for motorhomes. The plots are not level, the gray and black water discharge areas are very bad."
25743,1056491,3,jessuss,18/09/2020,"It is the typical free camping site without defined pitches. It is not intended for motorhome users; sewage is dumped in a shabby hut and gray water near the reception next to the road for access to the campsite, which makes it difficult for other vehicles to pass while emptying into a bad access hatch. ACSI accepted € 20 Correct attention Clean bathrooms and new"
25743,969570,4,ellastica,16/08/2020,"It is difficult to find a level place, but it is found. Pine forest with lots of shade. Ideal for bathing, sunbathing by the lake and stargazing at night. Very friendly staff. Expensive supermarket"

25743,946555,1,erika9,10/08/2020,"A lousy campsite, super high prices, after posting online that if dogs are allowed, when we get there they tell us that our dog is not allowed."
25743,946439,3,maraguila,10/08/2020,"Free camping camping, places without limit. Beautiful environment but difficult for cars to camp. Very dirty chemical toilet and gray emptying with a very small drain. If you go with children, the lake is a lot of fun. Showers quite dirty and puddled, as they have access to the lake, I imagine that maintenance is more difficult."
25743,925041,1,Vaniac,03/08/2020,The owner of the campsite is dedicated to reporting any motorhome he sees in the area. Better if you choose another campsite.

25743,919152,3,sandralm8,01/08/2020,"Uneven camping, without marked plots, free camping. Very good for the little ones, swimming pool, swamp, summer cinema, games... Price about 43 per day for two adults and two children, a little expensive, but good for what they offer. Nice place."
25743,908504,2,eusbanger,29/07/2020,"Free camping, very uneven site. Very expensive and scarce supermarket. Filling and emptying of water poorly solved. If you are not going to take advantage of the lake, it is better to go to another campsite."
25743,901489,4,Sheilatore,26/07/2020,"It is difficult to find a relatively flat place, but by searching you will find it. expensive supermarket. Hot water is limited, you are awake in the morning or at night forget to shower with hot water. You have the reservoir next door, pedalos, kayaks and paddle surf boards are rented. It has many activities. On Saturday night there was one from the star workshop, highly recommended."
25743,888629,2,MonicaMM,22/07/2020,"The camping area is free camping within the pine forest, it is very uneven, so it is difficult to find a level area. Furthermore, being among pine trees, it is difficult to maneuver with large vehicles. Being free camping, you may find a tent at your door"
25743,879393,1,letes,18/07/2020,"It's very bad to give terrible service to motorhomers and, on top of that, report those who don't enter their campsite. Don't go, they don't deserve our money!"
25743,609362,4,acalahorra,08/08/2019,"Camping in the middle of nature, the plots are not divided and the terrain is a bit irregular, but in our case it was not a problem and that we were a van and a tent of six. The facilities could be better but there are worse places, most importantly, the bathrooms were clean but to a certain extent it is this aspect could improve significantly and is the reason why I do not score with a five. However, it is seen that the campsite is slowly reforming the bathrooms since there are some newer than others. The rest of common areas such as the pool, the supermarket, or the bar shows that they are years old but well maintained although things could also be improved. The reason that made me fall in love with the campsite was the direct exit to the lake and the tranquility that there was. The water was very clean and has a kind of grass to relax. Canoes and pedal boats are rented at an economical price of 8-10 euros / hour. And at night the lake's lawn is ideal for lying down and seeing the stars."
25743,538823,1,carlos72,04/07/2019,"Free camping without control. Fixed caravan camping, expensive and dirty. Swimming pool. exit to the reservoir full of motor boats with the shore impregnated with oil and gasoline. A shame"
25743,478453,4,GitaTuristica,07/05/2019,"Large area with many permanent campers. The remarks about the noise can be seen in the light of the party tents next to the caravan. During our stay in early May everything was still firmly mothballed. We had two idyllic quiet days and nights in the pine forest near the lake, around which is easy to wander. Staff very friendly, but linguistically little flexible. The restaurant was closed, the swimming pool as well, the mini-shop was opened on Wusch (no bread). There is a lot of emphasis on clean terrain and clean sanitary facilities. Pleasantly warm shower water in unfortunately unheated building. The ACSI price of 20 € is not necessarily adapted to the offer."
25743,350666,3,Danialy,23/08/2018,"It is a charming campsite, among pine trees and next to the lake. Free camping, we had to share light with another store with a power strip because there are no outlets for everyone. To put another stick is a very noisy camping, many young people partying with loud music and we saw no one calling attention."
25743,331465,2,MMTruck,13/08/2018,"Camping without a delimited location, sloping and careful there is no electricity for everyone. For camping because the place is far from ideal for a small van as we go but we had to search for a long ""flat"" location and where we could connect. Bcp of people and very noisy in this season. The bathrooms are very clean and the lake is nice."
25743,322339,3,gabriel66,08/08/2018,"Compliant with other reviews correct campsite, beware, there is no first come first served location, ideal for 1 night."
25743,294747,1,gon943,20/07/2018,"The manager of this campsite if instead of denouncing the motorhomes that do not enter his campsite, he will offer exclusive overnight services for ac. I would earn more, what we get is that we hate mafia camping and do not enter. We do not spend the night in the restaurant, but very bad, so as not to return."
25743,289253,4,Fernandofercu,15/07/2018,"Super camping in a pine forest and stuck to the reservoir. Free camping among pines, clean and complete services, well-maintained camping. Perfect out of high season. Negative: A single chemical toilet in the whole campsite and does not have correct regilla for gray water."
25743,280185,4,Benitomorales,04/07/2018,"Ideal to go with children, quiet and in the shade of the pines. Without plots. We paid 41 euros per night, 3 adults and 3 children with motorhome, we did not find it too expensive since the campsite offers all the services. The only downside is that there is no dryer for clothes, but with a rope you can hang clothes between the pines."
25743,277268,4,Jh_azzo_spotter,29/06/2018,"Shady and quiet campsite at the edge of a lake. Ideal for a stopover and enjoy the sanitary. Attention the payment CB is accepted from 40 €. 32 € for 1 night, 3 adults with electrical connection."

25775,2448829,4,LluisMaria,17/10/2022,"Very well, that's correct, the problem is that it's one of those areas where to get water, you need tokens, which you have to get from one of the collaborating establishments. Nearby you have a bar that gives you food services.. If you go to Uharte, don't miss going up to see the hermitage of ""San Miguel"""

Close to the village and the municipal swimming pool. It has the minimum equipment one needs, it was in May (drainage, water, electricity), a very reasonable parking price (5 € per night). Exit from the fairly tight area for large motorhomes. We recommend."

The trees have very low branches that scratch the motorhome, a little maintenance by the council would be nice, since this area is municipal. The sewage drain box is too close and close to the drinking water tap, so it is very easy for it to be contaminated when emptying the cassette."

25775,417781,5,Corcho,30/12/2018,"Perfect area, very quiet with pools, bar and a very original park for children nearby. Loading and unloading of water. Without light. Out of free season."

The area is worth € 5 day, electricity or water with € 2 card (they sell them in the town in different establishments) with the ticket of the area you can use the pool shower (2 people per ticket per day)"
25775,299553,3,annayoscar,24/07/2018,"This area cost us dearly, first € 5 / night, € 2 water, and then there is a municipal swimming pool ... € 7 adults € 4 children, in the end almost like camping. The place is very quiet and there is shade but it is not to repeat"
25775,294111,1,robinboo75,20/07/2018,There are only two photos that are from the area. there are no games for children no barbecue. I found the drainage area with two cars parked in the village. I do not have to go after anyone to get the car out so I can drain. I think the photos they put on are deceptive.
25775,287623,4,Aitzii,13/07/2018,"Payment area with shadows, it is worth it, includes the discount at the entrance of the pool or the entrance to the shower. The electricity and water tb is for a fee, the fountain is in the barbecue area of ​​the recreational area at 50 meters. Several routes for the beriain come from the same area. We will return."
25775,246243,3,Babass35,04/05/2018,Nice view for some places. No shops nearby. Behind bars of building. We did not find children's games. Very calm. A bit expensive because very out of the city center. Good for one night.
25775,174828,5,laurashu,14/08/2017,A lot of shadow With pool € 8 per head ... it's worth it to rest from the summer heat. Maximum 48 hours ... € 5 per day. Very good

25775,151232,1,Salvi-Juarez,13/07/2017,"The operation is confusing. You have to buy chips in establishments in the center of town, far from the area. It is not clear where the sewage must be emptied because there is no indication. There is only one water tap to fill the tank and to clean the toilet. We do not recommend it."
25775,147227,5,txorrota,01/07/2017,The payment of € 5 is from June to September. while the pools are open. The payment entitles you to shower in the pools. the rest of the year is free
25775,144700,3,miticoarpege,21/06/2017,"Today the area looks a little neglected, however, well usable. A bit noisy the pool. ATTENTION the column where you pay has become a beehive with the hidden bees inside, when you approach it come out and sting (2 bites me and 1 my wife), to pay has been a struggle."
25775,122372,4,kriss85,08/03/2017,"Very quiet, access up to 9.00 m., Longer? on a hiking trail outside the village. Free off season without services except emptying black and gray water outside the car park. Good plan."
25775,90284,5,momar,06/08/2016,Very nice and quiet area. I only counted about 15 places really. Wooded area. In summer you have to pay € 5 per night. The payment is in a parking meter at the door that only accepts coins. Light and water with chips apart.
25775,81218,5,oiertxo,13/07/2016,"A highly recommended area. With views of San Donato and San Miguel de Aralar, two mountains that can be climbed from the area (1000 m of desnibel). Next door, picnic area, municipal swimming pools, bar, etc. 5 euros night jun-spt. Water and electeicidad by chips to 2 euros that are bought in the town. The only downside is the price of the pools, 7 euros, but they are very good and few people. Very quiet."

25775,48743,5,Jarpote,13/08/2015,"Very good place to stop and even explore the area, the environment is great, and do not have to deviate almost from the highway. There are mountain routes that go up to the mountains, it is very quiet to sleep, near a stream, and with the swimming pool of the nearby town. A machine with a system of chips (2 euros the card, chips that have in the village but the head of the pool bar also has) allows you with a card one hour of light and water intake. Then there are 15 plots to park and stay."

25796,3280355,2,oliver1007,10/09/2023,Very very basic site. Full to the brim even after booking several days in advance. We got to the last site that had a pothole.
25796,3242566,3,Bine2299,31/08/2023,"Functional, nothing more! All around high-rise buildings with noise until night, next to a construction site that also made noise until 9:30 p.m. Clay court, which is currently partially closed due to large puddles. Hardly any shade. No WiFi, no trash cans (referred to outside). And the exit only worked with the help of a fellow camper. Too expensive for that."
25796,3214088,2,leballer,25/08/2023,"Good place, in a village not far from the beach. 27 euros (including electricity and 1 euro for the shower) Not much plumbing, 3 toilets and a shower, but it's enough. But: in the morning at 7 a dog starts barking incessantly. As soon as he stops, people start mowing with a noisy machine or something. Absolutely tedious, so sleeping longer than 7/8 is impossible!!!!"
25796,3164218,4,mars72,17/08/2023,We spent 4 nights pretty well except with the noise from the street and the smell of garbage cans. Otherwise the manager is very nice. Rather clean area if people did not leave anything on the ground. Convenient toilets but a refresh would be nice. Shower 1€ for 5 mins frozen water.
25796,3123372,4,Hartzatxo,11/08/2023,"Good area, with everything you need and also a step away from the beach, but it is true that I need a little investment and maintenance."
25796,3004792,3,LaLola_en_ruta,23/07/2023,"It needs a reform in general. Showers and toilets very neglected. In favor, beach nearby and being able to book on the web. As of today 100% occupancy."
25796,2915432,4,galvez,02/07/2023,"Camping is in the middle of town so plenty of places to explore, beach nearby access via underpass as train alongside.   A little tight entering as cars parked both sides of the street.  If you book online you get a gate code, if not then ring the number on the gate and you will be able to enter.  Very nice friendly reception.  Toilets and shower is clean and shower works well. 1 euro 5 mins."

Costs E15 without electricity; Shower E1/5min ; toilets available - both somewhat dated but functional. Beach close by - same as the bakery and resturants. Station within walking distance for a trip to Barcelona; costs E11, = for a return"
25796,2817356,4,AnaCillerod,03/06/2023,"Good place for location since it is close to the center and the beach. With clean services. Wi-Fi, sink, sink. The possibility of being able to pay by card would be missing."

25796,2725649,4,michelmarie25,05/05/2023,"Well located 50 meters from the beach, shops and restaurants. Next to the pedestrian street. Very good pitch, shaded. The manager lets you choose your pitch. A phone call when you arrive, the barrier opens, you settle in and pay 18€ per night with electricity and wifi. Very reasonably priced in this area."
25796,2719156,4,familyontheroad23,03/05/2023,"Perfect pitch for us. Super uncomplicated, we arrived super late and it was totally uncomplicated. Were there two nights, very quiet and the supply on site was great."
25796,2703877,4,carmonavitor,28/04/2023,"very good area with all services 18 euros with electricity is borderline expensive, the station nearby to visit Barcelona, the Friday market good and cheap, just lacks a little maintenance of the place for the owner."
25796,2699602,3,Breiden,26/04/2023,"Unfortunately, my MTB was stolen at 6:43 in the morning, chained behind the mobile home, and rolled out. Apparently the access code is known to the thief. Good surveillance videos and a police report put the thief behind bars 2 days later. Thank you Xavi the operator for his quick and competent help. Supposedly the code allocation was immediately improved. Otherwise all good. Good weekly market around the corner."

25796,2671747,4,park4night3672Ae,15/04/2023,"Good, relatively quiet pitch with all the necessary facilities. The beach is easily accessible through the underpass of the railway line. The 15€ for one night are ok."
25796,2627706,4,lalelu18,28/03/2023,"We stood here for 2 days for €36 including electricity. You get a code for the gate. The owner wasn't there, but we were able to pay because you could leave the money in an envelope in her office. It was mostly quiet except that there is currently a construction site in the parallel street and it got loud relatively early in the morning. WLAN and relatively clean toilets and showers (5min = 1€) were also available to us. Yesterday we took the train to Barcelona, which was very practical (round trip €11) because the train station is about 500m from the pitch and our camper could be parked securely on the pitch."
25796,2622808,3,anndreala8,24/03/2023,"It does not accept card or bizum payments, you have to pay in cash. The site is fine for €18 with electricity, although it says that it has a shower and you have to pay €1 for 5 minutes… in the area it is difficult to find something decent to sleep in, unless you sleep in a field."
25796,2617020,4,Basoline,20/03/2023,"Surprisingly green place in the nice Penida. Substrate hard sand with grass. Lots of shrubs and trees. Nice and quiet, close to restaurants and bars and the shopping street. Plumbing really needs an upgrade: clean but hopelessly worn. The owner has put a lot of effort into good service and is very helpful. Please note: Friday market until 2 pm so main road closed."
25796,2598209,3,MundH,04/03/2023,"Somewhat unkempt place (especially the sanitary facilities are miserable). But all the more friendly operator who also gives good restaurant recommendations. Uncomplicated check-in (telephone call to the site operator and receive a code - in English possible). really very quiet location, so that you can sleep well in the open roof of a VW bus. For one night ok."
25796,2590113,4,ChristelleExposito,25/02/2023,"nickel, 1wc, 1 shower, a washing machine if needed. Secure, 100m from the beach, perfect for a night or two. I recommend."
25796,2583805,4,montanja,19/02/2023,"Nice place to stay. We payed 15€ per night, no electricity. It was one of the few places open in the area. We whatsapped before to check availability. Area is not that interesting and there was a lot of noise going on outside during the day (buildings being build, cars). We stayed two nights and really liked the WiFi (I was able to work with it). Outdated toilet and shower but works."
25796,2577554,4,lotteo,14/02/2023,Quite expensive for what you get. Sanitary facilities clean but very basic. Very close to the beach. Friendly owner!
25796,2573535,3,fabiocat,10/02/2023,"It has everything you need for a parking area. In the village, 50 meters from the sea and the station. Silent. 1 shower cost 1 euro for 5 minutes, nice hot. Electricity included 18 euros."

25796,2548490,4,Kandy49,10/01/2023,"Everything is fine, bathroom is old but clean! The driveway, okay, is sometimes very narrow with the streets full of parked cars, but today there was even an 8m long tandem axle on the square. If you can drive. The place reminds me of old Spain. Regarding electricity: if you follow the instructions of the place and don't use any additional heaters, it works, our coffee machine has 1000 watts !!"
25796,2541671,4,Boesmobiel,04/01/2023,"Great place from where you can walk the beautiful promenade to Calella, and from where we took the train to Barcelona. 22 euros (2p) and more than an hour of beautiful tracks via the coast later you are in this very beautiful city. Owner not seen but excellent support by phone (and in English!)"

25796,2522824,4,simmi120,16/12/2022,"A bit narrow entrance for large motorhomes, as it is in a residential area, but managed with the help of the groundskeeper, very nice staff, great website. Sanitary facilities could be better but hot water showers, no toilet paper! 1 hour to Barcelona by train, cheap and reliable. Beach in 5 minutes walk. Open 365 days, with constant contact with landlord possible."

25796,2412247,4,Lagalo,29/09/2022,"Very good place, quiet and spacious, with the necessary amenities (gray and black water), shower and laundry. Very close to the beach and the center. We are from Argentina and would return to this site without a doubt."
25796,2368303,4,selinaohniinsta,13/09/2022,Not the idyllic place but ok and centrally located. The shower only worked when we hit it and the coin slipped down. You can register online via the website and receive the code for the gate. This means that you don't have to refer to the reception times.
25796,2360566,4,linus0208,11/09/2022,A rather small campsite or parking space near the beach. you are almost between houses and very central. you can definitely recommend the place if you have your own showers and toilets because they are not very clean. otherwise everything was fine.
25796,2346338,4,AntonioyAnna,06/09/2022,"Nice rest area, almost a campsite in the city center. Finally an area with a wi fi that works well and not fake, I didn't even have to ask for it! Excellent combination of the site with Google to search for shops etc ... For me, a foreigner, I would like a mobile phone with whats app to be able to call or text and book. Near the sea and the train, near the shopping street .... I recommend it!"

25796,2331729,5,zapatitos57,02/09/2022,"I recommend it if you want luxuries here you don't have them but you will find yourself at ease which is what I value. The owner is helpful and friendly, access is easy for vehicles 7m and more, some may have problems but not because of the size of the vehicle anymore that trucks over 7m arrive at the hotel opposite to unload, the center and the beach are two minutes' walk away. I spend seasons there and I keep going."
25796,2321379,5,XaviR,30/08/2022,"I am the owner of AreaPineda. this is an answer for TAJBORDER. Access to the area is good. motorhomes of more than 7mts arrive, have arrived and will arrive. Hadta 8.50m there is usually no problem every weekend I am in the area. The only day I'm not here is Sunday (and this has been the first in two months that I've had a party. It's not true that there's no one there all weekend)"
25796,2320935,2,AUTOCARAVIAJAND,30/08/2022,"Bad access for AC of 7 meters, difficult to find the site due to access restrictions. Dirty bathrooms in the barracks, it looks more like an abandoned wasteland than an area, the owner doesn't even show up on the weekend and less to clean. Payment in cash and in an envelope in an office mailbox. The people who put 5 * have not been to the Alicante Areas with swimming pools or in Foz or Isla Cristina, I do not understand anything"
25796,2311112,4,WanNj,27/08/2022,Well located area: close to the sea and the main street of pineda. The little extra: possibility of booking and quick response from the owner
25796,2234514,1,B564,14/08/2022,"For the price paid, which is €22 per night, I think the services leave a bit to be desired, the bathrooms and showers don't look very good and the parking lot seems abandoned and uncared for. It says the Wi-Fi antenna is broken. Just for being close to the beach, for me the price is not worth it."
25796,2175675,4,rmz85,04/08/2022,"Nice place. Beach and train nearby. Reasonable rates. Only downside, a bit long journey (1h15) with young children."
25796,2139478,4,annime,29/07/2022,"Nice place. Found fast. Not far from the beach and the train station. By train to Barcelona about 1 hour. Unfortunately a bit louder, since the garbage disposal comes every evening. 22€ the night."
25796,2076262,2,ParejaTravel,15/07/2022,"To get out of trouble is fine. Very cheap and has bathrooms, the shower costs 1 euro for 5 minutes and the water is warm and very good. the thing is that it is in the middle of the city and it gives a bit of a bad feeling but good. for one night it's not so bad"
25796,1996280,3,Ruud-J,20/06/2022,"super location, less than 200 meters from the beach. plumbing is very few, simple and dated. shower 5 minutes for €1.- right in the center between the hotels and apartments. friendly manager"
25796,1982568,5,alfonspardo,16/06/2022,"Very central and well connected area. The management is very professional and friendly. Proximity to the beach. Being so central makes it not so quiet, but you can't have everything. Sufficient services, it has a website for reservations and information"

25796,1913637,4,ieiashs,24/05/2022,"We had a quiet night on the weekend. We contacted by WhatsApp and through the web, all very simple. The location is very good: close to the beach and the center of Pineda. The facilities are a bit old and I don't put 4 stars because I think the landscaping is much better: bushes, grasses and reeds very abandoned."
25796,1912940,2,edouard1227,24/05/2022,"After calling many times on the phone, it was impossible to get someone for the entry code, so we left, I don't understand that there isn't a permanence between 12 p.m. and 4 p.m. so I wouldn't come back"
25796,1912373,4,bordesjp,24/05/2022,"so close to everything, a joy, apart from access to 7m motorhomes, quiet and yet in the middle of town, walking there, a dream, that it lasts as long as possible. a delight"
25796,1908328,4,satv13,22/05/2022,"Very well located area, very close to the beach and the center of Pineda. Pros: you can take out chairs and table, location, close to barcelona and very quiet. CONS: It is one for the leftover, the old bathrooms, and the area with many herbs not too well cared for. Anyway we were very comfortable and very calm."
25796,1875233,5,MittLivIHusbil,07/05/2022,"This was a really good place to stay for 8 days. Near supermercatos, the beach, restaurants and a very nice and serviceminded host. I never used the laundry, but the shower, and the gray/black water tray worked fine! As well as to fill my camper with water when I left. I really recommend this place! For the price of €14 /night without electricity."
25796,1845524,1,FranceCRETOIS,22/04/2022,We wanted to stop there for one night but the ground was partly covered with water. Shame....
25796,1830783,5,AntonioRodriguez,17/04/2022,"It is quite good, close to the beach and the center. From the outside it looks like a parking lot, but inside it has a lot of green and it's comfortable. Not even at parties do you hear much noise. Bathrooms a bit old."
25796,1828008,4,remimartine,16/04/2022,"We stayed there from April 12 to 15, 2022. The price is normally €17 but as this week is the Catalan school holidays the price goes up to €19 a day. Otherwise everything is said in the other comments. Except that it lacks a bit of maintenance... The owner is very nice and speaks French very well. A nice little restaurant bar La Ponderosa with tapas close to the area."
25796,1809619,5,FelixDess,07/04/2022,"Very nice oasis in town, the pitches are a good size, the sanitary facilities are simple but clean. The operator is very nice and gives tips for things to do. You can only open the gate with a code, which allows you to arrive after reception opening hours. The WiFi works well. Supermarkets are nearby, very convenient. The beach is 200 m away. We will be back :)"

25796,1753531,4,Titi64Daline,12/02/2022,Very nice caretaker who also speaks French. Area well located in town and close to the page and all shops. Not too noisy despite its location (to see in summer).

Electricity supply, toilets, shower, gray water, discharge station and fresh water. Great surroundings and a short hop to the beach. Access to the square was made difficult by several construction sites, had to drive a short distance against the one-way street."
25796,1751050,3,Sunshine04,09/02/2022,Location central. Fairly quiet at night. The surrounding streets are narrow. This is not easy with vehicles that are 2.40 m wide or more. The sanitary containers are clean but very old and VERY simple. WiFi is good. No height limit. electricity is weak. Quite ok for 1-2 nights.
25796,1746199,4,terroropi,02/02/2022,"stood 2 nights. For the fact that the place is quite in the city, the price for the night 14 + 3 € electricity is quite okay. Only 1 € for a shower is questionable. Hardly any hot water. But otherwise great. In and out with code. night completed. Fits around Barcelona."
25796,1739303,4,Saseali,23/01/2022,"Very well located area, it is in the town and close to the beach and the promenade, it is very quiet despite being in the center, the only downside is that the entrance is narrow due to parked cars."
25796,1737084,3,mapman,19/01/2022,"The place is basically OK... But for €17 and a shower fee of €1, I'm quickly over €20. For that I prefer to go to the ACSI place in town with much more comfort in the sanitary area. Also constant power outages as the whole place is only secured with 16A and the circuit breaker is not accessible. WiFi is free."
25796,1736560,4,CINZIAontheROAD,18/01/2022,"Excellent place. Professional owner, he has created websites for any need. Fairly large, well-kept grass stations. Only one sink, untested showers. Convenient and clean secluded unloading area. It is not possible to download with the nautical one. Ok if you have macerator. Location in the center of the town, close to the sea. Very shady place due to buildings around. Closed with gate."

Poor value for money, we have been in other nearby areas that for the same price the services were much better. Around are all tall buildings where people watch you from the balcony. Positive: very quiet at night."

We ate really well at ""Can Joseph"" which is located in the pedestrian street, they are extremely friendly and prepare homemade dishes for you. It's worth the detour."

25796,63887,5,Dr.S.Philipp,17/02/2016,5 stars. no less. kind guard and everything you need around. although being surrounded by old apartment buildings that looked somehow strange on first sight we always felt very save.
25796,62698,4,cedys,17/01/2016,"The best, super quiet and clean all amenities price: 10 euros/night, water k7 wifi (which works) hot showers, disabled area if electricity it's 3 euros in short great in winter, note the proximity to all shops ( pedestrian streets) and the beach, large market of the week on Friday morning, beach side, it's good."
25796,62121,5,jacquy,03/01/2016,"Very warm welcome, friendly, couple always with a smile, ideal for spending a few days, the only downside all these buildings around us otherwise nothing to complain about."

25796,61222,5,saloune,20/12/2015,"Bravo to this young couple who have a great welcome, the quiet location near the train station near the beach. For 10 euros round trip, you go to Barcelona by train. And you spend one night with electricity and shower for 13 euros. We will come back, so great"
25796,59039,5,jojomanaco,30/10/2015,"Area very well located, right in the city center, close to the beach and the train station and pedestrian streets, everything can be done on foot, very welcoming owners, they speak French very well, area being finished but already very good. 10 € + 3 € if you need electricity, it's very reasonable, we'll come back that way"

25796,55341,3,Tasman,18/09/2015,"Area very well located in the town and very close to the beach... But the services are scarce, they do not allow awnings or tables and chairs, there are no services except WiFi and water loading and unloading.. Quiet to rest. Price in September /2015, €10."
25796,55125,5,itineo,16/09/2015,"This area has the merit of having been created in a city center. Access is tricky because you are in the city center. But I settled in for several days with a 7.40 m integral and a van trailer (total length 13.5 m). Arrive by the seaside and not by the National Highway, it's much easier. Plus I was there during the Férial, so there were a lot of parked cars, but that's OK when you know the size of your equipment."
25796,54698,5,itineo,12/09/2015,"Passing on Pineda de Mar, we discovered this new area. We stayed several days as the welcome, the place is nice. Less than 100 m from the beach and the city center, you will not find better for miles around. The owner very friendly speaks French, it's a plus. In the evening you have the key to the Portal to return after 21 hours. For an area created, 1 month ago, there are still things to do but its owner is already gone. Come encourage him."
25796,54225,5,Mikel380,08/09/2015,"Hello, we were there on September 5 and 6, great tranquility, highly recommended, for walking, cycling, and being calm, a 10."

25796,47878,5,sanderic,10/08/2015,"Very practical area, right in the city center, water services, electricity (€3), drainage, sanitary facilities (wc and shower) wifi very soon. Barely 100 m from the beach. In the middle of buildings but quiet, on grass. Considering the areas in the region, super awesome. The only downside is that you have to cross the city center but with a 7 m long it's okay: €12 per night"
25796,45980,5,Akemola,04/08/2015,50 meters from the beach. Perfect!
25809,3230240,5,JavitoSan,28/08/2023,"beautiful, with a little river beach. quiet and easy to access. Try to squeeze in so as not to collapse the parking lot."
25809,3128897,5,VictorCaamano,12/08/2023,"Super nice beach, there were no signs of dogs but we saw a couple of dogs around, so we took him out on a leash and there was no problem, he bathed and everything! Two parking areas, one next to the beach bar and the other just behind the beach, with slightly worse access for cars (somewhat narrow) but we (5.70m) got into it without a problem. Pretty level."
25809,3016856,5,laponche,25/07/2023,"Great spot very quiet to spend the night. Owner of the bar very nice, he told us where to sit best. We have a 7m50 motorhome and were able to park without difficulty."
25809,2432815,5,rdunky,09/10/2022,"Excellent spot, very quiet in September, we were alone to sleep. During the day, a few fishermen come to park. Swimming in the very pleasant lake, clean water. A marked mountain bike circuit passes through the (ruta btt la Carballeda). Very interesting, we saw herds of deer. I recommend."

25809,1553423,5,Sue_,06/09/2021,"We arrived at night and accessed the camper without any problem. There was no one, a civil guard patrol passed but they didn't tell us anything. Very quiet night and beautiful sunrise. The site is spectacular. It was our first stop on the trip and we were delighted."
25809,1515910,5,celinelo96,26/08/2021,"Great site. It has a perfect beach to spend the day, a beach bar and a good parking area, the road to get here is very well paved but it is a little narrow for motorhomes, nothing impossible but worth mentioning. A very quiet and pleasant place"
25809,1499953,1,JuliePetit,22/08/2021,Bad idea in the middle of August ... if you are looking for calm this will not be there.

25809,656411,1,Cipomon,24/08/2019,"Access with motorhome a little difficult by terrain, stones, trees and turns. Access prohibited with dogs, according to posters (I don't know ordinance). The beach is small and looks like a swamp (muddy soil)."

25809,294668,4,anviaes,20/07/2018,You can park at the chiringuito or at the top but you have to enter another way. There is some shade. Near the highway to make a stop.

25841,3211288,4,TicosinCorte,24/08/2023,Perfect place to spend the night quiet and with more vans and AC. Without services and many flies and mosquitoes is the only bad thing. Arrive early or late because during the day there are many parked cars. The beach is fine but a bit difficult to take a bath because it is a rocky area.
25841,3122285,5,anderarzamendi,11/08/2023,"Very spacious and quiet. The beach is great. In the parking lot above there are showers, but this place is very nice."

25841,3107598,3,Mariankelesyajelandra,09/08/2023,"Spacious parking facing the sea. They are supposed to allow dogs, but at some entrance to the beach there is a sign that prohibits entry. We were on a cloudy day and not having many visitors, we were able to enter. The worst thing about the site is the number of flies, it is impossible to have a window open."
25841,3105890,5,traven.pl,09/08/2023,We spent a quiet night here. I recommend the place for campervans.
25841,3088530,3,MiguelMY,06/08/2023,"We had to go to the other parking lot to protect ourselves from the air that was making it, since all the AC was moving. We spent a day at the beach and moved late in the afternoon to the other parking lot next to the bar on the beach. Comment that the beach is not very good for bathing due to the amount of stones and algae, apart from the air it made. The same without air you sleep well."
25841,3084354,3,Rober_SR,05/08/2023,"Cobbled access not the best for AC, not great, 1km of narrow cobbled road. It parks well, it's quiet, although in the middle of the night some ""nice"" threw firecrackers at us from a car to wake us up and annoy us. We continued sleeping after they left The beach does not have services or lifeguards, but to take a quick dip, it works."
25841,3069113,5,RitxiAzzena,03/08/2023,A luxurious sunset. There are hardly any people. You can be with dogs and at night there is absolutely no one. 100% recommended!
25841,3019522,5,Paichi,25/07/2023,"The access is not very good, at least for where maps led us, 1 km of narrow cobbled road. It parks well, it is quiet to take a dip, eat and continue on the road. We did not stay to sleep, but it does not seem noisy unless there are external factors"
25841,3005936,5,worekcementu,23/07/2023,We had a nice quiet night. The beach is very nice. The perfect place for a walk at sunset. Toilets at the beach bar. And going further you can see an interesting coastline. In the town there is an old windmill and a lighthouse.
25841,2959417,4,kike1815,13/07/2023,"Very nice and quiet beachfront parking. We spent 1 night. No services. A spectacular sunset, both from the beach and from the parking lot itself. Difficult to bathe in the sea"
25841,2939503,4,Bertafor2,08/07/2023,"Beautiful place, quiet at night, beautiful beach, great sunset. There is no toilet, so please have one on board. Beach rather unsuitable for swimming, rather drive a little further north (Praia de Carreço), which is guarded and has a bar and toilet."

25841,2019250,5,Lemarelta,28/06/2022,beautiful place. The path is a bit narrow but very nice. It has recycling bins. The place is quiet and the Camino de Santiago runs through it.

25841,1620061,5,Andrea-Dinis,01/10/2021,"Spectacular. On the beach. Very quiet at this time of year. We were only 3 AC. Pretty flat. I imagine that in summer it is much busier. There is an eco-road that goes to Viana do Castelo (6 - 7 km.) It is all flat and goes along the entire coast, very beautiful."
25841,1611954,5,pinguinosadventures,27/09/2021,"Amazing location. Right on the beach,  very quiet, made use of the free outdoor showers. Was cold but useful for us. Other campers here but not busy and very respectful. Beach is beautiful possible to swim but to cold for us. Small cafe at the start of the road. Road is good cobbles with multiple wooden boardwalk access to the beach if you dont want to cross the sand. Travelling a couple in a T5"

However, people started coming to the beach so early in the morning and at 9.30 the place was absolutely packed, it was even difficult to reach the main road because of the amount of cars coming in the opposite direction (it was saturday!!)"

But it seems that in summer, with more ambientillo is a spectacular place to sleep. You are on the beach and there are many places to park."

25849,2741307,2,Rhithik,11/05/2023,Too expensive for what you get. Older campsite (being refurbished at the moment) with lots of shade in a forest. Had quiet nights. Swimming pool closed until mid-June (it is still a green dirty pool). There are several old caravans.
25849,2444445,4,KlausBirk,15/10/2022,Nice campsite if you don't have too high expectations. Facilities a bit dated but clean and working. The owner(?) was very friendly.
25849,2206533,5,MatBol,09/08/2022,A month with the camper. On Mondays there is a large market in fundao. excellent campsite with clean swimming pool and sanitary facilities.

Lively during the day and quiet at night, lots of French people, few tents, lots of vans and motorhomes. 17€ per night with water electricity and swimming pool access (2 adults/3 children)"
25849,1887449,1,corsicasard2021,13/05/2022,"Absolutely not worthy of a camping site, we were the only ones who stayed overnight, all the rest of the dilapidated caravans have not been used for a long time, but a few toilets available, not recommended."
25849,1766163,4,isa41,26/02/2022,certainly there are things to say we stayed there the restaurant it's new owners speak French we did not use the showers we use those of the cc nor the swimming pool because of our dog we never leave him alone but every time she is clean the boss looks boorish but when we know him he is nice we go back there willingly o cão campião do mundo
25849,1703124,2,oscar106,04/12/2021,"A shame, the toilets and showers are very dirty. The toilets have no lid to sit on, toilet bins are full. Quiet place, with the possibility of routes on foot or by bike from the door."
25849,1701386,2,Kentuckyken,01/12/2021,"Out of season this place looks like a disused old campsite. The attendant was pretty unhelpful and just wanted to get back to his sofa. Don’t know if it had waste or water, as wasn’t shown. It was ok for one night as there isn’t much choice in the area."
25849,1638077,3,F.Miranda,11/10/2021,"Ok the park is not new, but it is inside a very nice park with lots of trees, inside the mountain of Gardunha natural park. Lot’s of hike tracks marked from here, mountains bike tracks, very good park for children and the top of the cherry… the Paddel Tennis court! In summer the pool is nice, off summer the paddle is great. There is a squash court 5 min away (by car) inside the “Parque Desportivo”"
25849,1578366,2,PMesquita,14/09/2021,"A park with enormous potential but in very poor condition. Deplorable hygiene, very dirty changing rooms and showers, swimming pool with little care. Nice restaurant with good value for money."

Poor facilities, not clean. had a good week there."
25849,1385319,3,jordio,31/07/2021,"Sorry to say, apart from the swimming pool that is well treated, the camping places looks like a park for abandoned caravans. Very nice shades in all of the space. the bathrooms are small and nothing that deserves reference. good for one night since there aren't too many camp spots on the area."

25849,612456,4,speedraph,09/08/2019,"Small really cheap campsite (2 adults, 2 children, 1 motorhome with electricity = 15,70 €). Nice to stop a night on the road to France. Old sanitary but clean. Very nice home"
25849,597190,5,lesbeni,04/08/2019,"Camping very well. We stayed 1 night, time for a stop on our course. Very nice staff, very good value for money, 13 € per night for 2 people in camper, with water and electricity, swimming pool, nothing to say. well equipped for emptying and filling, super quiet and shaded, free space, bar and small restaurant. However we did not use the sanitary, but in the first visual, correct."
25849,563649,1,tatianuca,20/07/2019,"Apart from what is left of the campsite, and the gloomy appearance that the upper part has, with abandoned ""rulots"" and like a shack made with pallets, we had a bad experience with a naked man who was hanging around the bathrooms and we stayed looking to the point of having to move with the van to the entrance and spend the night in the parking lot of the bar. We will not return."
25849,518562,4,csm,17/06/2019,"We enjoyed the shade and tranquility of this small campsite. Too bad it is not better maintained (old), however the toilets were clean, there is hot water, easy emptying, beautiful pool, cheap."
25849,506840,4,Paxy,07/06/2019,"Camping with a large potential but poorly maintained in terms of green spaces. Quiet and relaxing, well shaded, it is well equipped with pool, restaurant (good quality). Wifi is not exploitable. A good step to regain strength."

25849,384807,1,Arianabg,29/09/2018,"Note that positive comments date back at least 1 month ago. At the moment, the dirt takes over. In the bathroom, the last cleaning note dates from July. Location has potential but is abandoned, disorganized. At the front desk the clerk was extremely clumsy. We only stayed one night because it was too late to look elsewhere."
25849,358229,3,Tanruz,29/08/2018,Quiet if you ask to bring in the dog. Satellite TV only works at the entrance.

25849,261715,3,Sergio12,31/05/2018,"Nice camping, but early in the season (May 3). A bit limited for 7m motorhomes, but very friendly welcome. As for the kings of the disgruntled Wifi, they have to go to the hotel!"
25849,145234,4,tine83,24/06/2017,"Home very friendly, the guard always ready to help, speaks English, his wife speaks French but is there that evening from 19h. Well shaded squares, clean and spacious bathrooms. Except near the swimming pool which is municipal and which some times welcomes people not very disciplined. Practical little restaurant bar in the campsite."
25849,120275,1,Tornjak,16/02/2017,"2017.02.16 - This shabby municipal campsite is actually cheap. It offers shameful and offbeat services in this country very attached to the quality of the welcome and the service! Badly exposed, perilous access very narrow and only one camper place where we have a satellite reception! Wifi: no one is able to communicate the right access codes! If you can, run away."

25892,3231130,4,krysreine,28/08/2023,We didn't spend the night here but perfect for visiting this pretty town. Very close to the city center via the park along the canal with its kinds of gondolas. There is indeed the possibility of renting bicycles. Very good for the day.
25892,3166641,4,MenfysVan,17/08/2023,"The site is very spacious to park motorhomes of any size. At this time there is a lot of free space. We coincided with 4 more motorhomes that spent the night there. The place is very quiet, but since there are buildings under construction, the works began at 8:00 a.m. with the noise typical of a construction site. Perfect location for a boat ride."

We went before to the one under the highway but we didn't like it. To spend the day in Aveiro it is the best option, but not to sleep simply because there are many cars going by and it will be noisy, we also saw that there was another free parking lot on the block."

Full sun, not a tree on the horizon, only buildings and building sites… full sun, inappropriate in the middle of summer. Can help out to visit because remains well located.

Now that I am accompanied, it is the best place to spend the night and get to know this beautiful town. The only problem there are are the trains that can disturb the most sensitive at night. A motorhome area in this city, please."
25892,773389,5,DrivingDeeDee,28/01/2020,Huge free gravel car park over the road from the canal. No views of the canal when parked up at the back though so not a picturesque spot. We just parked up for lunch and then went for a walk along the canal into the main centre but it was very touristy so decided to move on and not stay the night.

I stayed overnight and although I like to sleep in quieter places, as it is close to the train line and is also a busy place in terms of cars and people, the night was quiet and quite well spent, being the morning quite calm for the place. what is. It seemed safe to me from the reports I read here and I also found that it is quite safe to leave the campervan there when we are visiting. I can add that I had difficulty finding a restaurant that stood out from the middle and so decided to opt for one that had good value for money with the food presented and was well served in the ""restaurant helm master"", ate the ""cod Narcissus"" ;-)"

The facilities are very well maintained and have washing machines, dryers, a basketball court, ping-pong, picnic tables... even a fronton court! It also has access to the forest behind for a short walk. Friendly staff and prices as in the area. We didn't get to use the restaurant but it looked good."

Walking is far and with a steep slope, and parking in the town is very complicated - it fills up (August) to the brim. Either early morning or at night. I think it would have been better to spend the night in the parking lot (there are no signs that prohibit it)"
25943,1459373,5,Rafikis,15/08/2021,"Beautiful, well-kept campsite, pretty nice pitches, well-maintained toilets and a magnificent swimming pool. As buts, apart from the usual uphill slope (be careful, coming from Durango the GPS indicates a road with a 26% slope, caravans forbidden: DO NOT GO UP THERE; access is made after passing the town (narrow in some section) and the climb is important but it can be done, very well paved). To put some but: the supermarket is very very scarce, and it is very far from the town, so go supplied. Also, the dryer does not work (they should take more care of those details)."

But a sign as soon as you enter the track warns: no more than 2 meters in height and no more than 5 meters in length. So for both reasons we are left out. I would say not suitable for caravans. And ask to spend the night AND NOT CAMP There were 6 patrols organizing when we passed. If we don't respect first they will fine, then they will ban, and it would be a shame."

There are signs prohibiting camping, but no one paid attention to them... The only drawback is the people who turn a parking lot into an excessive camp. There was a car with a tent over it, two hammocks between trees and the whole structure of table and chairs with canopy. They weren't the only ones."

Around 9pm the civil guard passed but they did not stop. At 8am another patrol appeared and they bit us to tell us that this time it was passing (they saw us with the children), but that it was not allowed to stay overnight. Of about 10/13 campers that there were only they came to ours."

25945,853014,1,Marnamado,07/07/2020,"The allowed measure to enter the caravan length is 5.5 meters. It is signposted at the entrance to the beach. Our car is 7.5m, therefore we could no longer get off. So we continue in the same direction, barely 1km, until we reach HOTEL CANERO- restaurant and hostel. The owners have a free private parking where you can stay overnight, surrounded by green and under a bridge that does not disturb noise. When you get up in the morning you can go up to breakfast and take a walk on the beach that is just below the hotel."
25945,838302,5,Pataka,27/06/2020,"It is a wonderful site. The atmosphere is great, very calm. The beach is rocky but beautiful. A lot of surfer comes. It has toilets and showers and a very cozy beach bar. Also several trails to the surroundings for a good walk."

Beautiful peaceful location and no problems with guardia - never saw them but another camper we met said they had been in that morning before we arrived checking people’s papers but not saying anything about camping or not.

But at 4:45 in the morning we were awakened by the Civil Guard so that we could leave, they also asked us for a DNI for a possible fine ... I'll tell you what's coming. They protected themselves in the law of demarcation of coasts ... in the summer months I think it is better to avoid such sites."

- Beautiful and close to the water. 
- Even surface with gras

- Toilet only in main season

25945,340402,5,rubius,17/08/2018,"Special place. Very surfy beach, down a little narrow in a couple of curves. My car is 7.30 and it was fair. In August they have placed a yellow prohibition signal (for works) to vehicles over 5.50m. A real fudge, because as always, a local cacique, again discriminate against the campers. The Civil Guard is going to fine meter in hand. A shame"

Beware the civil guard goes frequently in the early morning to check that no vehicle (more than 5.5m seems it ...) spent the night. If you want to avoid taking the risk, large parking 5 minutes by car in counter height, very quiet"
25945,326006,4,lluis521,10/08/2018,"A lovely place, and quiet. But ATTENTION, this morning have appeared 3 cars of the Civil Guard with meter in hand measuring the length of the vehicles that were there. Anyone who exceeded 5 meters and a half was fine. Reason? a traffic signal in the entrance indicating the maximum length. And today I had to raise ... by the way, the bike carriers also count."

Access to the toilet, a lively snack bar in the evening (without noise nuisance for those who sleep), a small hut to rent boards! Access by a small road without height limitation and there does not seem to be any risk of control for those who wish to stay sleep! Super night for us!"
25945,311649,5,lalilaila,02/08/2018,"Beautiful place for sunrise. We have spent a night and a full day without problem. In the morning came the Civil Guard and called attention to some kids who were in tents, camper and buses nothing. In summer quiet bar, without excessive noise. There are bathrooms and showers. We traveled with a bitch and until the rescuers arrived we could be with her in the beach area, then they told us that on the beach you could not, but that in the part of the river you would turn a blind eye and so it was. A spectacular day without a doubt and a 100% recommended place. Beware of the beginning of the descent can rub the bass!"

If you follow the path along the river you will find fresh spring water and after 5 minutes come to a great bar/hotel that does good menu del dia for 13 euros. Small roads so nothing more than a medium sized camper, but otherwise a lovely spot!"

25945,183759,4,Hidae,24/08/2017,"Very nice place, next to the beach. At the entrance of the road says that camping is forbidden but there are many vans and motor homes overnight. In summer season there are beach bars, beach showers and 3 toilets, one of them open all night. Eye with approaching the sand with the vehicle, you can run aground! Better to get away from the wooded area, many mosquitoes and bugs at night"

There is a bit of a bad smell though so not sure we would stay overnight - that's not to say you couldn't as it looked very open for overnight stays. No signs to say otherwise.

In this park usually have food rolls which is good if you want to eat and drink at one hour late at night but it is convenient to park farther away so as not to have the noise of people who stop at night to eat. I liked the place."

The parking is cobbled, but when we arrived all the Ac were parked in the area of ​​land, outside the parking area."

25974,357584,1,pucky,28/08/2018,Just off the road to Lisbon so very very noisy. In addition it is probably a private property because it is the entrance of a field of sheep. The farmer went to 22:30 to see what was happening because the dogs were barking and the sheep were shaking. I advise against it.
25974,221708,5,Camash67,06/02/2018,"It is true that it is small, large vehicles go your way, but for a small motorhome or van it's great, small climb but our faithful C25 has managed to face it. While the road is right in front, but there is really little passage, plus we get full 4g, it's great! Thank you, it's cute as stopover."
25981,3283700,1,LaTitorra,11/09/2023,"Very ugly campsite, no shade. Very old sanitary blocks, not very clean (there is no toilet paper, hand soap or hand dryer). Pila to wash clothes drains at your feet, a marranada. Gym with pounding music and shouting from early in the morning. Don't be fooled by the good looks of the reception. I give it one star because leaving the campsite you have beautiful views."

Far from the center but the tour of the peninsula on foot is nice to visit (13kms)24€ 2 people/electricity. Friendly staff, clean toilets, hot showers. Small swimming pool and gym. The 2 stars because the parking for the CC is really not great."
25981,3232794,3,KSNK,29/08/2023,"We were only there one night. Staff was friendly, quick check in. We only used the shower and it was pleasantly warm. The place itself is far away from the action. You need a car to get to the beach and town, but it's cheap, cheaper than the other alternative, which isn't any better either."

However, they sold us a pitch with electricity for our motorhome, but our adapter does not plug into their socket. They told me that the Intermarché next door sold it, which is not the case. I asked them to lower our rate for the service we don't have, they wouldn't listen."

Suddenly we had to park it in front of the CP. still drove purely trailers on our place. Boss said trailer must go, or pay €17 for an extra seat. wanted to stay 3-4 days. left the next day. Others paid €12 + €5"
25981,2690237,1,EOHE44,23/04/2023,The staff is nice but the place is horrible the place is like a fort we need to pay for the dog and we can’t drink the water there. The camper vans are to close so you can’t really sleep and for 2adults 2kids is 30euros I don’t recommend it.

Unfortunately they didn't have any more for sale. lots of nice little houses to rent, for campers there are pitches in between - yes and there are walls but when you consider the location on the coast it doesn't matter because you are either by the sea or in the restaurants around."

Do not go to the snack bar, you will pay 10e for a bad pizza and you will suffer from diarrhea and a horrible stomach ache the next day. At the reception, they are very nice and the night costs 20e so not expensive. Convenient if you just want to take a good shower and have a nice walk nearby."

It's best not to take the shortest route to town suggested by Google Maps (at least not in the dark), but instead walk along the outside of the water into town, as it's not very safe. 20€/night for 2 people and a campervan"
25981,2125024,2,ybayba,26/07/2022,"Staff is nice but camping is no big deal to us. The place is beautiful, views of the cliffs, although from the other side it looks like an industrial estate."

For one or two nights of passage it is feasible."
25981,2101820,2,salvaje21,21/07/2022,Very simple campsite. Apparently refurbished but just had a face lift. Very friendly workers and snack bar with sea views. Pet friendly. 2 adults and camper: €20 (free electricity). It has an area to empty the dirty water tank and refill clean water.

It is not in a beach area. NOT RECOMMENDED AND MUCH LESS WITH CHILDREN. The walls have barbed wire and glass .... it gives a terrible image"

25981,1593787,2,Dan-el,20/09/2021,Expensive for what it offers. small plots and far from the beach. The camping is fine for a bungalow but not for us. We went to the camper park in Peniche

The plots are small, but there were not many people and we had the ones next to it free so ok"
25981,1114080,1,Lui3000,10/11/2020,"Worst campsite so far. The toilets and showers are very old, which doesn't bother us, but they are very dirty! I only went in once and actually not very sensitive otherwise. The pipes are broken too. Had expected something else. The parking spaces are not nice. If you don't want to park behind a wall, you stand on a street. Much too expensive for that."

The sanitary facilities are completely in order. Not up to date but very clean and functional. Always nice warm water for showering. As a camper, I don't need the luxury. Otherwise I can stay at home. 30 minutes on foot to the center. Supermarket 15 minutes. Bus terminal from Peniche in various directions (Obidos, Lisbon etc.) within 30 minutes walking distance. Well worth a visit for me again."

We went for a ride with the motorhome, and when we returned ... we had no place to plug. Very cold because of the wind."
25981,311997,3,olimago,02/08/2018,1 night with a van. 2 people with electricity The restaurant is very good and the staff very kind and helpful perfect. 15 € per night Who says better ...
25981,297311,4,EOI,22/07/2018,"Camping, small without big luxuries but all right, indoor pool (windy) € 15 two adults with motorhome, electricity and services included. Each adult at € 3.80 and € 1.90 child. (Cafeteria)"
25981,291440,2,TometVal,17/07/2018,Camping just fine for one night but no more. The cleanliness leaves something to be desired. The campsite is still under construction. Only advantage: the proximity of the city center (with bicycles). Indeed the price is not expensive 15 € per night 2 people a van and electricity but we have done other campsites at 10 € with services really top.
25981,288589,5,vahine,14/07/2018,"Top, great view of the ocean. Small but covered pool with sun lounger. Electricity in block so provide a good extension. We stayed at 4 for 2 night = $ 35 so good value for money. There is a Supermercado at 10 minutes walk"
25981,268571,2,Derfnam57,14/06/2018,"We spent a night in a camper, currently under construction once completed it can be quite a lot. We paid € 9 for 2 all inclusive. At this price, there is no need to complain. Location seaside, superb."
25981,260934,3,PBK,29/05/2018,"Camping with pool and spa. Old sanitary but hot water and quite clean. We saw worse. Snack to avoid ... Benefit in adequacy with the price. (22 € for 2 nights: 1 van, 2 pers, 1 dog with Elec In off season)."
25981,254902,3,Toucanos,18/05/2018,"This is my second visit and if last year we saw and heard work, this year it's the same, nothing has moved despite the presence of workers. The services for motorhomes are more than lousy! The toilets are clean no more (ass plastic cans like soap dish ...) against heated pool and SPA ... Everyone will find his account. In summary very well to visit Peniche by bike. Note anyway low rates (9 € for the night)"
25981,182634,3,vanontheroad,23/08/2017,Nice campground but maybe left a little bit going. Excellent price with all services included.
25981,153102,2,patrick41120,17/07/2017,"Camping dilapidated, awakened at 8am in the morning by the workers who ride wooden chalets, noise saw hammers and generator all day, power cut during the works, Wifi more than summary very slow untimely cuts every 5 minutes. No access to the sea, some camper areas look more like a dump. Supermarket Continent 1 km walk from 9h to 23h, locations facing the sea reduced to 4 motorhomes only by elbowing provided you find camper-drivers with civic sense and sharing. Shower and toilets dilapidated but clean, barbecue available, 19,20 € 1 camper, 2 people and 2 dogs, parking camper 2 people 15 € dogs, 2,10 € / dog"
25981,137324,2,Toucanos,25/05/2017,"After a day and a night spent on the spot, I remove 2 stars: the site reserved for motorhomes is squatted by locals who consider that they took their place and everything that goes with (table ... ), campers arrived later were placed in the middle of the site ... In short, apart from water accessible everywhere."
25981,137064,4,Toucanos,24/05/2017,"Actually under construction now; for now in low season, a sector for large motorhomes but the sites are half used by caravans all year round (?) very close to the cliff, superb above the ocean but in the campsite we can not see anything, we have to go out! But hey, for 8 € there is nothing to say, Wi-Fi, electricity, water at almost every location ... So, I put 1 star more"
25981,136733,4,didierluc,22/05/2017,Home of the campsite very nice simple camping for the price of 9 € per day with electricity a good example for motorhomes with a heated pool and covered a bit of wind certainly very quiet the night even with a building site not too noisy everything in the day he must work he has spent the night without problems you can come without worry Didier
25981,136056,4,mickdobrasil,19/05/2017,"Camping visited during the preparations for the great season: super home, dream location facing the north coast of the peninsula and a few pedal strokes downtown, comfortable, affordable, but work in progress ..."
25981,134341,5,ouette63,11/05/2017,"Well placed with ocean view, clean, sanitary a little old but not at all shaded. Supermarkets next door. 11,10 € for a van, 2 adults, a dog and edf. Very good for spring but must be hot in summer."
25981,125077,1,XJJG,03/04/2017,"Personally we returned to the campsite and emerged immediately ... cold place, lifeless and not pretty at all! a large car park with walls in full circles ... short not to our taste!"

25981,95385,4,sebontheroad,15/08/2016,"Camping friendly, good atmosphere, we place where we want, the electrical terminals are a bit difficult to find but are indicated on the entry plan. A lot of wind. Sanitary very clean, heated pool, bar with a beautiful view .. Very little shade but we fn # lol"
25981,93475,1,fetoa,12/08/2016,"Camping with plots for motorhome, at camping prices. Dirty, without shade, and no power plugs. You can already take a good extension cord, otherwise there is no way to plug it. Two adults and one child about € 20."
25981,92890,2,fano49,11/08/2016,"Rather noisy, car passage, location on the sea side on the grass and other locations on sand, sanitary clean no more if not two steps from the mall."
25981,82407,1,globetrottet,17/07/2016,It looks more like a bad supermarket parking surrounded by walls than a campsite! No interest...
25981,80722,5,laillerp,10/07/2016,"Very good, walking access to Peniche 20 minutes. Small fish restaurant nearby."
25981,54954,3,reliz46,15/09/2015,"Two nights spent at this campsite on September 14th and 15th. The setting is fantastic facing the sea, and the place is quieter. Sanitary a little outdated but for 9 € electricity and wifi included, do not ask too much."
25984,3286698,4,Janina2911,11/09/2023,"We came relatively spontaneously and got a place. Mid-September is still considered high season and is therefore very expensive at €32 (1 night, 2 adults, 1 van, no electricity). Places are very sloping, compensating wedges are absolutely necessary! Lots of youth groups = lots of noise. Otherwise there is a lot on offer for the money (gym, kiosk, bar, restaurant, sauna, children's playground etc). Steep path to the beach"
25984,3284682,4,tobiloiby,11/09/2023,Nice campsite! To reach the beach you have to walk about 15 minutes. The way back is a bit steep. The beach is very beautiful and ideal for surfers. The sanitary facilities were clean.
25984,3282969,3,CampiBoris,10/09/2023,"The incredible facilities, there is everything. The perfect stay, the tent plot well covered by trees. Bathrooms a little poorly distributed, but clean. Many people."
25984,3276399,5,SelinaSchaubeck,09/09/2023,Great view of the ocean and beach. Beach is 20mins down the stairs. Toilets and showers clean. Some pits are quite muddy and small. We arrived without a reservation and it was no problem to stay a night. All in all a very nice place and Zarautz beach is beautiful!
25984,3264916,4,penngann,06/09/2023,"surfer atmosphere, so quite nice. even if it is far from the beach, the descent via the steps is worth the detour. For the return, you can take bus line 3 (weekdays) or 2 on weekends, for barely 2 EUR. The station closest to the beach is at the train station."
25984,3256468,3,roganjosh,04/09/2023,"Great location and beautiful general area, just outside the town with a long but steep walk down to a great surfing beach! Good facilities with fresh pastries in the morning. Good hot showers. The downside is that the plots are muddy in the rain (our neighbours got stuck), and not level, there is no privacy and it is very noisy, felt a bit like a youth club at night, you can’t escape the people."
25984,3248741,3,bullihias,02/09/2023,"Since the pitches are quite muddy and crooked, it is very dirty, especially in the rain. Otherwise nice campsite with a nice location."
25984,3242078,3,malennaa,31/08/2023,If you are looking for a quiet place this is not your place. Lots of crowds of people with little space between plot and plot. It had been recommended to me but I expected much more
25984,3241967,4,Nini1711,31/08/2023,"High campsite, beautiful view of the ocean from the surrounding hiking trails, very well equipped. Plots correct in size but muddy, unfortunately not all of them have gravel. Good restaurant and pleasant staff."
25984,3235744,4,manuflus,29/08/2023,"€65 approx. two nights for VW T5 with two adults without electricity. Space for all types of vehicles. Several bathrooms depending on the area and quite spacious. Recreational areas with even a gym. The ""but"" is in the location. Good views depending on the plot that touches you but being on top of the mountain or you move the van or go down the beach access with many steps."
25984,3227349,2,SharkTravel,27/08/2023,"You have to be very lucky to get a spot with a good view. The pitches sink into the mud when it rains. Some have been raised with gravel. No idea why not just all of them. At €32 in a van for 2 people without electricity, the money should definitely be there. Disappointing."
25984,3210851,5,Nini11189,24/08/2023,Very nice campsite laid out in terraces. Sanitary facilities are cleaned several times a day. Cheap washing machines (4€). Ideal for children with a play area for the little ones and a playground/soccer field for older children. Therefore sometimes a bit louder depending on which place you have. Great sea views from many places. Great surf spot!
25984,3188346,5,lynchhagen,20/08/2023,"Hard to find a campsite with such a view. Supermarket not great but clean washrooms, launderette and a couple of restaurants. sufficient electric points. 400 odd steps down to beach.Takes about 15mins and another 15 to Zarutz centre.A bus goes back and forth every half hour."
25984,3142341,3,lesvoyageuses,14/08/2023,"very clean sanitary facilities, 4th washing machine, 4th dryer. supermarket, bar and restaurant. 33euros for a van without electricity for 2pers. for us too expensive for what it is. in addition disrespectful camper from 7:30 a.m. the mess: people talking loudly, slamming doors, screaming children, barking dog. apart from the view nothing exceptional."
25984,3136120,5,annettebruno,13/08/2023,"Very quiet, restaurant, supermarket, clean toilets. Wash/dry laundry for 8€. We paid 51€/night for 3 ad 1 eft with a camping car and electricity. You can go there only to shower 5€/p or fill up and empty your water 6€. Sporty beach access because 460 steps but magnificent view! Lots of waves, supervised beach. Beach along the golf course authorized for naturists."
25984,3068435,5,St0ninger,03/08/2023,Super nice place and very nice staff! Were there at short notice and got a great inexpensive place :) 500 steps to the beach ensure the daily sport balance! We would like to come again :)

25984,2996992,5,BelloBlanco,21/07/2023,"beautiful location! we called in the morning if there was still room. at that time the campsite was full, but they gave the tip to come around 12 o'clock because most of them had checked out by then. we did and we got a spot. everything is clean. walk down is beautiful. tip we have for the campsite; make some fences into a hedge, so that the places have a little more privacy."
25984,2950388,4,EspeJuls,11/07/2023,"An extraordinary stay, all the services are very clean and complete, the staff has an exquisite treatment and we will surely return to enjoy it for more days because we loved Zarauz. The road that goes to the beach, although it is a bit steep, is worth doing, there is a magnificent view of the Zarauz beach"
25984,2940662,3,CamperlifeSundP,09/07/2023,"Nice camping on the hill above Zarautz, but the stairs down and to the beach are godless ;) Sanitary facilities moderately clean, but the place is also very crowded. It's a pity that you only get the good pitches if you stay longer, otherwise you'll be standing on terraces below the pitch. Has potential but is carelessly made."
25984,2915600,4,Barajita,02/07/2023,"Camping with a very cool location, going up and down to the beach can be a bit expensive for some people, but in general very good. Camping with all the comforts!!!!"

25984,2881476,5,WB97,22/06/2023,Great place and despite the size very quiet and relaxed. Clean sanitary facilities and a small hiking trail to the beach (about 10 minutes). Very nice employees.
25984,2871526,5,Oldistar,19/06/2023,"Very nice site, some pitches with gravel - we had a site with a sea view in April 2023, but the grass was so soft from the rain that other campers had to help us to get back to the paved road; so be careful where you go. Sanitary very clean, with € 23.00 middle price range. Very nice hiking trails to the sea and a historic ore loading station."
25984,2870095,3,tovv,19/06/2023,Quite ok for an overnight stay. The sanitary facilities are clean and spacious. Unfortunately hooks are missing everywhere. The supermarket and the restaurant are careless and the products are not of high quality. The plots are available in many large. Power connections and water points everywhere. Your sauna is also ok. The prices for the service are very high. The view and the beach are really great

25984,2837195,4,SeraPhina2023,09/06/2023,"Fantastic location, great services. Very good spas. Physically challenging beach access with many steps. Some roads inside the park are very narrow, making it difficult to maneuver large motorhomes."
25984,2836878,3,CCElton,09/06/2023,"We stayed here in December 2022 and January 2023, both passing through. Very nice place. For transit fully ok. To go a little further to the beach if you are planning a longer summer holiday here. Sanitary facilities are cleaned regularly, but are very basic and could use renovation. Restaurant was good and operator very nice"
25984,2832086,4,Blutzivanlife,08/06/2023,"A beautiful place with large and modern sanitary facilities. The beach is a bit steep, but doable."

25984,2817169,5,jocelynh,03/06/2023,"Beautiful location, the pitches on the outside edge of the campsite have gorgeous views. Excellent facilities, everything you could want and all very clean. Only downside is the pitches are small, and it feels crowded and busy."
25984,2813583,5,Velta90,02/06/2023,"fantastic camping. unique location in the terrain. nice and clean. really recommended. fantastic vineyard in the immediate vicinity and a fantastically nice path down to the beach. we were going to surf. But hopeless to park a motorhome in the city so had to give up. we could take prams, dogs, boards and all other equipment down the stairs to surf. But that is the best. go down the stairs to surf. don't drive the car down."
25984,2791422,5,maschaontrack,27/05/2023,"Super location, you can see the sea almost everywhere. From the campsite a nice path towards the beach / sea / rocks. Dog Free! Sanitary okay. I was there in May and it was packed! How is that possible?? Full of surfers and campervans. Small spots. Good price/quality. I paid 13 € without electricity with a camper. Shop and kind of snack bar/restaurant. Reception also English speaking."
25984,2773897,5,pjirsak,21/05/2023,Great place to stay! Facilities are clean. Accept asci card in a low sesson. 23€/night. Lovely views from some of the pitches.

Not many clean water points. Sports equipment and games for children. Nice sea view for some location. Store with essentials, bread and croissants. I have a large CC (8.9 m) I was entitled to two places for 29.5 €. We will come back."
25984,2763878,4,RubenDom,19/05/2023,Camping with all the comforts. The plots are large and at an economic level it was acceptable. Perhaps we lacked being able to have a transport (bus) to Zarautz since there is quite a distance and a lot of unevenness. At reception they told us that the transport was only enabled in the summer months.
25984,2754472,4,sunlightdelight,16/05/2023,"Great campsite with fantastic views over the bay. Downside is very high and steep so beach was a challenge haha. Furthermore, the campsite is fine"
25984,2742524,3,ChrSchulze,11/05/2023,"On the mountain, only the seats at the front of the hedge enjoy the view. Sanitary is mostly clean, plots for large WoMos sufficient. Front desk is friendly. The restaurant isn't, it's a snack bar at best. Plus points are the camper supplies at the reception and the shop. The way to the beach is officially closed. However, if you want to go to town, it is better to take the road."

25984,2570787,3,eudaldbrunet,07/02/2023,We were able to shower for €3/person but the showers were open at the top and it was very cold
25984,2560999,5,VeniVidiBibi,26/01/2023,"Great winter stop. everything open , laundry, bar and restaurant, small shop.
showers and WC all clean 
Good motorhome service points.

only drawback,  its a long walk to anywhere , lovely walks , but it's a steep hill.

with Acsi cost us £20 P.N"
25984,2552947,5,Chd1,16/01/2023,A good place with friendly staff. Well located to visit San Sebastián.
25984,2551421,5,r.thormann,14/01/2023,"Everything fits, nice parking space, flat, good sanitary facilities and disposal options. The restaurant has the charm of a train station concourse, but the food is okay. 439 steps lead down to the beach and town, recommended excursion."
25984,2549859,5,ManniMaster,12/01/2023,Great place. Sanitary facilities clean. Pitches big enough. Great view. A few steps lead to the beach. I can only recommend!
25984,2547231,5,Schortinio,09/01/2023,"Really an excellent spot and the campsite has everything you could wish for. Many and sufficiently large pitches, some with breathtaking views of the bay and the city. Great walkway from the campsite down to the beach. 1A service facilities clean and well maintained. The restaurant has great local fish specialities. Simply a dream for January!"
25984,2544470,5,usthree2021,06/01/2023,"Clean, friendly, well equipped! Stairs down and up to Zarautz are a challenge, but the place and the beach are worth it. Reception until 9 p.m. We will definitely be back!"
25984,2542542,5,BIGPETEpretzen,05/01/2023,Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Beautiful location overlooking the sea and the beach. Clean sanitary facilities. Note: Trailers (e.g. for motorcycles) can easily be parked separately. Train connection to San Sebastián.
25984,2542438,5,LandyMuc,05/01/2023,Great sea view. Very friendly staff. Clean sanitary facilities with plenty of warm water (not always a matter of course everywhere)
25984,2531895,5,Mistel,29/12/2022,"Very friendly welcome, beautiful location, small shop, clean sanitary facilities - we'd love to come back!"
25984,2531586,5,BJB8586,28/12/2022,"tiptop. Clean, cheap, great view... definitely recommended!"
25984,2524693,5,Lominator,19/12/2022,- very friendly staff - very well-kept sanitary facilities - great value for money!
25984,2519932,4,JeanGuillemot,11/12/2022,"Quiet campsite, beautiful pitches, clean sanitary facilities. Nice view of the village of Zarautz. To recommend."
25984,2519001,5,larsGrewenig,11/12/2022,very nice and quiet campsite with a great viewpoint nearby. we paid €23.90 for two people in a camper without electricity.
25984,2517759,5,titofran,09/12/2022,"Good camping for the season of the year that we are, since many are closed, friendly and very clean services"
25984,2513356,5,waspo,05/12/2022,Nice and quiet in the off-season. With great views but a bit far from the beach. Probably quite crowded in high season. Priced at €31 already in the upper segment.
25984,2499457,5,LeonLuca,18/11/2022,"Great campsite! Paid 17€ for 1 van, 1 adult and electricity. (Nov 22) One of the few open all year round. Well maintained. There's even a free gym. We recommend!"
25984,2489111,5,JLPicard,09/11/2022,"Anyone who gets a parking space at the rear edge has a great view. The place is big and the staff is very friendly. The beach is accessible via a path, but a lot of stairs. Sanitary facilities clean and sufficient."
25984,2487884,5,Lumi17,08/11/2022,Really fantastic view. We got a spot on the edge overlooking the beach. Especially suitable for small motorhomes. Small spots but not bad. Lots of surfers so cozy but quiet at 10 o'clock. We enjoyed the walk down to the beach and of course back up again. Good to do.
25984,2470328,5,Damotra1992,30/10/2022,"Good campsite in Zarautz, it had a good plot with electricity connection for 36 euros, we took a 7 meter AC. The descent to the town is important for older people, or with little mobility. For the others, a bit of exercise after eating some good pintxos. No noise to sleep and quite clean and tidy. I would repeat without a doubt."
25984,2469686,5,KevClarc,29/10/2022,Great campsite with amazing views over the coast. We asked for a seaview however beware those pitches can be very windy.  Friendly reception good shop bar restaurant. Faculties modern clean plenty of hot water. about 15 min walk along the boardwalk into the lovely town yes there's 436 step down & up if it bothers you don't stay there!! Would use again. Went for 2 nights stayed 4
25984,2466568,4,TatiBG,28/10/2022,Campsite with a very good location. We paid €27 for one day (2 people current camper) It has good facilities and good workers.
25984,2464735,3,Hennaaa,27/10/2022,"Since we prefer quiet and contemplative CP, we decided to drive again after 1 night. It is really very well organized, clean, etc., but you are very close together (it feels like a slightly wider parking lot) + has no privacy screen (bushes, trees). Since it is terraced, you also have people directly behind you from behind. If you don't mind that, you're sure to have a good time here :)"
25984,2456240,5,Nici1979,22/10/2022,"Super pitch. Clean, quiet and well-kept. Great view. The only point is that you are a little out of the way."
25984,2455044,4,hannahdreiskaemper,21/10/2022,"Great location, right on the sea. Clean sanitary facilities. Very sympathetic owner."
25984,2454036,4,guyota,20/10/2022,"It is a very good compromise, not very far from San Sebastián. Only a few places have ocean view and the places are very small. The campground was very full but quiet enough for the crowds. There is a very basic little store, a nice playground for the little ones."
25984,2453384,5,travellingfinn,20/10/2022,Worth the price. You'll find all the services you need here and the sanitary facilities are clean. The minimarket does not have much to offer but the shops in city are within walking distance. Great exercise promised when visiting the beach downhill.
25984,2453069,5,sifrailke,20/10/2022,"Have been here for a few days (at spot 1M). This is by far the best place to look out over the beach and the sea and the outskirts of Zarautz. It is also next to the exit gate to walk to the beach - take note! Down is totally fine, but going up with some surfboards is tough haha."
25984,2451928,5,Niddaham,19/10/2022,already for the 2x time on the square. Pleasant atmosphere with views of the sea from some pitches. Sanitary always clean. Own restaurant being handed over to a new tenant. The way to the beach in Zarautz leads over 463 steps. The surfers take it in endurance runs to warm up. But not me. We recommend!
25984,2443656,4,ccbuchn,14/10/2022,Good campsite. Quite expensive 68€ for two nights two people. Walk to beach is long but worth it. Showers never got warm for us. Could’ve been a timing thing.
25984,2442940,4,cornedita,14/10/2022,"We asked at reception for a seat with a sea view and got it, even though it was pretty busy for the time of year. Perfect view and only 439 steps to the beach! Lots of surfers on the go, you can watch for hours. Sanitary facilities are cleaned regularly, large showers! A point deduction because the plots are very small, you sleep next door, so to speak."
25984,2440713,5,minisamglo,13/10/2022,"Campsite with all facilities, panoramic path with direct access to the beach, friendly staff even in case of excellent rain. The dryer."
25984,2432874,4,Archelon5,09/10/2022,"Frankly, I don't see the reception problem. Narrow pitches and we are well placed, which did not prevent the neighboring Belgian caravan from hooking us up with a finding. Zarautz, we like it or not. Me, I like with its stairs, its surfers and its beach."
25984,2431383,3,Zigotto34,08/10/2022,"Home far from friendly. Very nice campsite with a magnificent view. Small grocery store with bread. Correct location, but provide holds Electricity practically next door. Drain station OK. Nice restaurant with a menu at 12.50€ but not at the top at all. Attention to go to the beach it is worth 1000 steps there and back Sanitary clean with hot water. €25 or €20 ACSI card"
25984,2430660,3,scyoc,08/10/2022,"Small plots, very close to each other. The water didn't work and the showers didn't work either. The bathrooms are quite dirty for the price paid. The best thing is that the supermarket has a bakery and direct access to the beach ideal for surfers (steep slope and 400 steps)"
25984,2427581,4,lifri,06/10/2022,"Great location, lots of surfers and a correspondingly relaxed atmosphere. We liked it. The seats are really not that big, but it was enough for us (VW Bulli). The way to the beach is doable, way back a bit tiring."
25984,2418291,4,CarolinHintz,02/10/2022,"Large campsite at the top of the mountain, unbeatable views if you get a good spot. But there are also very narrow places with little sun. The way to the beach is long but of course with a wonderful panorama. But I wouldn't do that to myself every day and with a surfboard. Sanitary facilities new and clean!"
25984,2411735,3,kenayl,29/09/2022,"beautiful in itself. if you stay one night, you get a really small parking space (not bigger than the vehicle). you live about 20 cm away from your neighbors. Lots of young surfers. Volume okay but pitches are a bit dirty. Sanitary facilities and staff are great. Beach is beautiful and distance is short. OK for transit (open all year round) and for surfing."
25984,2409656,4,CamperHorschd,28/09/2022,Beautiful place above the bay of Zersaus. Very good sanitary facilities to spend a few nights. Unfortunately a bit small places.
25984,2405745,5,WinonaHammann,26/09/2022,"We'd love to come back, there's still something going on at the end of September, the view is beautiful, the beach is great, the sanitary facilities are clean, but there are a few very small pitches. We paid €38 (low season) per night (4 p. car tent without electricity). The many surfers run up and down the 500 steps every day, so it's quite a doable way to the beach, even if it requires some conditions."
25984,2373260,3,Rosie53,15/09/2022,"Campsite located high up. Magnificent view. But path and steps to get to the beach. Impeccable sanitary facilities, services for motorhomes (water, emptying, electricity). Friendly and competent staff. DEPLORABLE restaurant. Places are small, each square meter is optimized, promiscuity assured. Impersonal campsite. City without interest."
25984,2372355,3,wauwau,14/09/2022,"Very big and impersonal. The seats are also quite small and you stand quite close together. The location is quite nice. To get to the beach, however, you have to walk a few hundred steps! A solid place but nothing more."
25984,2367892,2,credo2012,13/09/2022,Places very small and unsuitable for larger Womos. Restaurant very dingy. Place today 13.9.22 totally overcrowded!
25984,2363750,4,bram001,12/09/2022,"Good camping with good facilities. Rather busy and packed, however with a nice vibe. Access to the beach with a 15 min walk. Bit pricy but its okay for the facilities. 37 euros for 2p a van and electricity."
25984,2359749,3,BartTheFoxx,11/09/2022,"Very large campsite where you are crammed together like sardines. Price on 10/9 is 35€ for 2 people with a campervan electricity. Plumbing is definitely OK, showers are very large."
25984,2348397,5,MrsVanny,07/09/2022,"Top campsite, super nice staff, beautiful beach with waves. Definitely recommended for water sports enthusiasts. Nice stairs also towards the sea. I say go for it!"
25984,2342465,2,MC1960,05/09/2022,Very large campsite. We are packed like sardines. The toilets are clean. Passing through campsite because not friendly. 33€ per night is expensive.
25984,2336553,4,WVT1973,03/09/2022,"Excellent campsite, stood here for 2 nights with camper bus incl. electricity €35 per night. Stairs to the beach is a must do!!"
25984,2336426,4,bordignondany,03/09/2022,It is a good campsite for visiting the region. With our van we were put in a very cool place with clean sanitary facilities outside the ⛺ with a view of the sea I recommend this campsite.
25984,2334289,4,kimsvito,03/09/2022,"Nice clean campsite. If you get a seat with a sea view, awesome! Small gym even available. What was unpleasant was that we were very strictly warned to be quiet around 0:30 (which we were). But apparently you are not allowed to stay in front of the bosom there after 12."
25984,2331811,4,eska81,02/09/2022,Good camping for those into surfing or trying to escape the bust of San Sebastian. Very nice bathrooms and staff are kind. Not that cheap though. Good for a one day stop.
25984,2318859,4,Pandemcamper,29/08/2022,"Great view. Nice area. Lots of young people, a bit noisy. But otherwise great"
25984,2299445,3,Evertrenske,25/08/2022,"You will be helped by very nice staff! However, the part of the campsite where we were located were many young people who played (loud) music. Glad the security stopped this from 00:00. The sink is not very clean. We thought it was a relatively expensive campsite. Beach on the other hand is completely worth the stairs! If you are looking for a surf cam with a friendly atmosphere, this is the perfect location."
25984,2298562,5,domileonie,25/08/2022,Super nice campsite! Clean sanitary facilities. Fair price 20€ per night for one person with camper without electricity. Great view and you are quite fast on the beach below. Will definitely be back.
25984,2272598,4,clairette95,20/08/2022,"3 great nights at this campsite. Very busy often full. But very good atmosphere. Good services, €26 for a tent pitch. Very pleasant staff. The plus: magnificent view of the beach and, on the other side, the hinterland."
25984,2262617,5,Ninachibb,18/08/2022,Super good care. They were full and they gave us info on other campsites. In the end we decided to take a shower for €3/pax and when we arrived with the things to pay they told us that a plot had just been released. Van 2pax €30/night (Light apart €5). The best views and sunset.
25984,2232035,3,lalom8,13/08/2022,Campsite with a youth hostel atmosphere in the middle of summer: lots of young people come to surf and party. Not very quiet at night and music during the day on the speakers of the campers… however in the morning it is very quiet ;-). Sanitary facilities are also strained in the face of all these young people. But the overall atmosphere is good-natured. The restaurant is ok
25984,2207217,5,msaez,10/08/2022,"In itself Zarautz and the Basque country do not disappoint. I fell in love with this campsite last year and we have returned. Clean, excellently well staffed, with a great restaurant and excellent service. good weather, dream views... in short... to repeat for many years."
25984,2195617,4,andretortt,08/08/2022,"Great camping with view on bay, bathrooms clean but could be better, and good Wi-Fi (not covering the whole camping). For surfing  you are right on the spot but you have 500 stairs to hike down/up the hill. Good leg workout!"
25984,2183022,5,nigsin,06/08/2022,"Very well organized CP with small restaurants and shop. The toilets are cleaned several times a day and are always clean (even in high season). Some of the places are a bit small, which could sometimes be a problem for large vehicles. The (surf) beach can be reached via stairs in about 10 minutes."
25984,2147906,5,benrem,30/07/2022,Great large campsite on the hill with a fantastic view of Zarautz Bay. Sanitary facilities are always clean and there are enough showers/toilets. Check-in was quick and uncomplicated. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the beach via steps. Everything perfect!
25984,2143047,5,tahira,29/07/2022,Large and quite crowded (in high season) campsite with new and extremely clean sanitary facilities!!! About 15 minutes to the beach with many steps. Leisure activities for children are large. Small grocery store with a good selection. 30€ for one night (2 people) in a small car without tent and electricity!
25984,2140588,5,samara85,29/07/2022,"Great camping, super good atmosphere and very quiet! Very cool that there is a WC for the little ones. The descent to the beach is very beautiful and although there are stairs, the little ones go down it well. We went for a walk and then we took a taxi for €10. Great Eduardo (taxi driver-google)!"
25984,2139575,5,AMorente,29/07/2022,"Very perfect place, impressive views, very clean services !!! Attentive camping staff, the supermarket has just the best to bring everything from outside (there is bread) the night €35 2 people and electricity. Flat pitches with little incline, they left us some small chocks for free! To go down to the beach there is a direct path, that is 500 steps... but it is worth it. Just downstairs there is a space where you can bathe with the dog."
25984,2134643,5,swedenhello,28/07/2022,Fantastic campsite. Great staff when we arrived. So polite and helpful. The view from the area its mindblowing. Toilets is perfect. Thank you for three wonderful days.
25984,2116235,3,Jizzlbee,24/07/2022,"Very full campsite, which allows an uncomplicated check-in. The sanitary facilities are great, the view is priceless - BUT: loud, crowded, cars are constantly driving up and down the square. You can't get any rest. Even just before midnight, pegs are still being hammered into the ground."
25984,2103782,3,HuhnundAuto,21/07/2022,"we didn't have electricity and so we stood between a lot of young people on Friday evening. There was no rest all night. this was really annoying as we were very tired. Accordingly, the sanitary facilities had the charm of a youth hostel, including cotton pads, leftover make-up... but the view from up there is really nice!"
25984,2103617,3,emilyse,21/07/2022,"Huge campsite (unfortunately very very full), about 450 steps to the beach & to the city, it takes about 20-30 min. Louder in the evenings, as there are many young people here. super nice employees who still accommodated us, although everything was actually full. Sanitary is fine, but often full due to the many campers"
25984,2096777,4,smorra,20/07/2022,Nice place but overcrowded so that we had to change places once in two days.
25984,2076761,3,Stephmoulig,15/07/2022,"Campsite offering a magnificent view of the ocean. Access to the beach difficult with young children. Friendly welcome and speaking French. Pitch large enough for a car with roof tent. Sanitary correct: aging furniture, but regular cleaning. Restaurant not tested on site because full, but possibility to take away the meal, which was good. Nice campsite but nothing more."
25984,2075769,4,Sophie2316,15/07/2022,"Busy campsite in high season. Arrived the same day and we had one of the last places. The situation is splendid at the top of the cliffs. Beach 10 minutes on foot but with a steep drop, more than 400 steps!! No stroller usable. Clean sanitary. Narrow location."
25984,2065874,5,scheina1605,12/07/2022,"Nice campsite with a fantastic view over the bay. Spent an easy night here. Very big, yet quiet. Sanitary facilities were OK."
25984,2059251,4,juju40530,11/07/2022,"very well located at the top of the cliff. long descent to go to the big beach of zarautz. but the pitches are very small, expensive (€37 without electricity) and no games for children. very lively in the evening. otherwise the sanitary facilities are clean (and note the sanitary facilities for children, great idea!). to do again in low season it must be more pleasant when it is not complete..."
25984,2057962,5,Spirou2,10/07/2022,Great place. You have to accept the almost 500 steps to the beach. But you will be rewarded with an amazing view. The place is top managed. The sanitary facilities are new.
25984,2052683,4,bethponsford,09/07/2022,lovely views of the beach. steep climb down but not too long. flat pitches of varying sizes. good facilities and nice bar/restaurant. prices seems a lot but you get a lot. we even used the gym that is free just get a card from reception. ended up two nights instead of one.
25984,2051576,4,Pratik,08/07/2022,"very nice campsite, a beautiful view of the ocean, a friendly welcome. new sanitary facilities and regular cleaning just the price 35€ but it seems to be the right price in July in the Spanish Basque country"
25984,2048340,5,Eurilja,07/07/2022,"Great campsite to stay too! Nice location and short walk to a great beach with great surfing. Friendly atmosphere, very well designed for families. Around 30€ per night for 2 people, a tent and electricity"
25984,2042107,5,JannelValenniels,05/07/2022,"Lovely hilltop site right by the sea, with well laid out motorhome pitches and full amenities. Pleasant dumping ground for dirty water and emptying chemical toilets, good sanitary facilities, very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Also to visit without reservation, not too expensive. Nice walking area, tough for cycling, unless you use an electric bicycle. Then do good. No negatives, so definitely recommended."
25984,2028686,4,Frau-Hort,01/07/2022,"We stayed 3 nights from 23.-26.6. A very well-kept campsite, with play facilities for the kids, a great view of the sea from almost everywhere. The walk to the beach is a workout with a great view. 3 nights 1 adult, 1 child, vwt4 and electricity 80€."
25984,2018897,4,elatribu,28/06/2022,"Night with van two adults and a baby for 30.40 euros without electricity. As excellent camping and services, but somewhat expensive if you only want to spend the night."
25984,2000428,3,vamospyrenees,22/06/2022,We spent a night in a van for two without electricity...33€! Too expensive for the service and our needs! If you are with children or come for the surf...it should be more profitable for you.
25984,1988015,4,pooya.en,18/06/2022,"Clean toilets and shower. Some pitches without shade (it gets hot and uncomfortable on sunny days). Way to the beach Descent by about 600 stairs and (an important point for surfing). Also important: every 3 or 4 places has a power distributor (without extension cable), so take a few meters at least 5m with you."
25984,1984249,4,arlenebaart,17/06/2022,"Great quiet campsite, but very small pitches and hut muttje. No privacy. Good atmosphere and nice view, receptionist could be a bit friendlier."
25984,1981327,5,Ursula1122,16/06/2022,"Great place. Clean toilet/showers. Restaurant/bar. As a solo traveler cost without electricity 15,80euro. Free Wi-Fi and Nice surfing place. A lot of surfers here."
25984,1975649,5,meikerik,14/06/2022,Beautiful campsite with beautiful views. Excellent sanitary facilities.
25984,1974257,5,natxoykeren,13/06/2022,"A great campsite! We have only been one night, because we were going back home, but we liked it a lot. One night, a van, two people and a dog, with electricity: €30.40. It has all the basic services: clean shower rooms, sinks, supermarket, there are restaurants, etc. The plots are level, there are some with sea views. From the campsite you can go down to the beach."
25984,1943722,2,gigasegeln,03/06/2022,"Sanitary facilities are clean, restaurant is okay. However, the pitches are extremely small, everything is tightly packed. Only the few pitches by the fence benefit from the generally beautiful location of the campsite. The way to town or to the beach is long and steep. Okay for one night."
25984,1940828,3,parkers12,02/06/2022,"Very nice place with a magnificent view, green overlooking the sea. In terms of location, it's really very tight against each other. intimacy not possible. The toilets are fine. Some places are not level. On the reception side it's not always great, we rush you because it's the factory, very difficult to choose your place. For the view, the M seats are good. Catering service a bit limited."
25984,1923779,5,AlexisMari,28/05/2022,"It is a fabulous Campín, with all the comforts, with panoramic views out of the ordinary. The staff is also very friendly. The plots are quite generous, most of them on grass, and with almost no slope. There is a path that goes to the beach with 600 steps, but beautiful, and others to a kind of ruins that are also very beautiful. There is a place to wash clothes both by machine and by hand, perfectly clean showers and bathrooms, and the accesses are also super cool."
25984,1911280,4,furgonetero94,23/05/2022,"€23 for a van, two people with a dog. Everything clean and neat, good atmosphere"

25984,1898609,4,MATURANO,18/05/2022,"very warm welcome, a place with a view of the sea, just magnificent, beautiful sunset, the 439 steps to go to the beach: original, reasonable price, to be redone"
25984,1862716,5,mudakonn,01/05/2022,"Staying here is expensive, but if you are together with children I recommend it as there is playground, football pitch, trampoline etc. Do not use the washing machine or dryer because they are poor quality. Washing machine leaves clothes too wet and dryer doesn’t dry properly (also other campers had problems with both machines). The view to the town is amazing, same goes with the sunsets."
25984,1860898,3,reggaesteph80,30/04/2022,"Very good Equipment in general and clean. But in my opinion to avoid in season and weekends, it's the factory … the Booking is too fast and difficult to really choose its location. Suddenly other people 2m from me and location not level and full of mud while there were plenty of other available and more intimate. Price 16.59 only with a van and electricity"
25984,1860528,5,Breiden,29/04/2022,"Very, very nice place: view of Zarautz and the sea and sunset. Place in very good condition, toilet and shower top. Beautiful MTB mountain tours possible. To the beach over 600 wooden steps and 100 meters in altitude in 15 minutes. Thank you Oskar!"
25984,1858315,5,Don-Carlo,28/04/2022,"A very nice campsite. Gastronomy is OK. The view is super good. The sanitary rooms are new and clean. However, you shouldn't have foot problems. The beach is 100 meters above sea level with 439 steps. The beach is very large and beautiful and above all very clean."
25984,1848096,5,ismaelguirado,23/04/2022,"Very good, very quiet. A long distance to go with small children to Zarautz. many stairs. but a very cool area, the mine is great..."
25984,1837010,4,ivanpastorh,19/04/2022,"The site is fine. The kitchen sinks were somewhat dirty, as were the showers, but passable. The price seemed a bit high, but it was Easter."
25984,1831670,5,Viictoriaventura,17/04/2022,"A camping trip. Super quiet, with stunning views and everything very clean! We would repeat without a doubt. I recommend an energy bar to climb the 439 stairs to go to the beach! Haha It's well worth going down."
25984,1819078,4,Jzeus,13/04/2022,"Very nice place, everything very clean and perfect treatment, except for the bar which is a bit borderline. The very beautiful town, to get there you have to go down 439 steps or take a taxi."
25984,1814390,4,tobiandlaura,10/04/2022,We (2) paid 56€ for 2 nights with a van. The location is good for visiting the city or hiking in the area. The sanitary facilities were very clean.
25984,1807530,5,Arist,05/04/2022,"Nice place, great view over the sea. Nice sanitary facilities. Friendly reception at the reception. 20 euros with ACSI card."
25984,1806633,4,CatT17,04/04/2022,"Lovely location, stunning views and the walk down to the beach/the town is beautiful (think there are 439 steps down/back up to the site) facilities onsite are clean, showers are good and brand new washing machines for laundry. On-site shop has tasty fresh bread and sell local wines (they helped us chose one which was helpful and kind). Pitches a little small but didn’t bother us. Would return!"
25984,1806608,4,bemo,04/04/2022,The price-performance ratio is great. Great view. Simple but clean showers and toilets. Very small pitches. It was great for 2 nights.
25984,1802359,3,KatieCampbell,31/03/2022,"Busy campsite with not much space between pitches. Lovely walk to the beach with lots of surfers on the big waves! Go to the bar on the right on the way in rather than the one in the campsite, the food is great and cheap with massive portions! Also delicious local wines."
25984,1800699,5,park4nightAP,30/03/2022,"An exceptional view, a very clean campsite and a pleasant welcome. We stayed 2 nights"
25984,1798045,5,monikatomas,27/03/2022,"This was the best camp on our monthly trip, when we will spend 1-2 nights in the camp!  Toilets and showers maximally clean. A cleaning lady often goes.  Quiet and peaceful camp.  The restaurant cooks late into the night.  Great satisfaction with everything! There are a lot of beautiful places in the area.  We recommend!"
25984,1795359,5,benjuandfam,25/03/2022,"Super nice campsite. We were introduced at 11 p.m. by the security staff. Super nice staff at the reception. Sanitary facilities absolutely clean. Beautiful sea view. Great with a dog (you can go for a nice walk) and children (nice playground, trampoline). Highly Recommended!"
25984,1793754,4,Van4life64,24/03/2022,"Very nice campsite with very clean sanitary facilities, hot showers, gray water and WC emptying and filling, superb view of the sea and Zarautz. very friendly welcome, clean and flat location, €28 with 6A electricity, hearty restaurant, mini-market, good value for money! Stairs take you to the beach and the city center (30 mins on foot, it goes down well on the way there and goes up well on the way back)"
25984,1791040,3,EmmasVan,21/03/2022,Nice reception. Great environment! Prices ok! Pitches too narrow! Fine for short stays.
25984,1781151,5,titidu64100,12/03/2022,"Campsite open out of season very clean. Beautiful pitches with an extraordinary view. Small flat, it's a bit far from the city center."
25984,1776800,4,Maxi599,07/03/2022,Everything that makes a good campsite is there! The location is spectacular but also very remote. For me unfortunately only practical for one night!
25984,1770612,5,petboarder,01/03/2022,"Nice and clean campsite. Friendly and helpful reception. Pitches partly grass, partly gravel and mostly straight, nothing that you can't get out with wedges. Magnificent view over the Bay of Zarautz. Value for money absolutely fine."
25984,1757076,4,Gopvan,15/02/2022,"We spent one night 2 people, camper and electricity €28. Campsite with great views, very clean facilities and WC. He would need to level some plots. For us, a mandatory stop whenever we visit Zarautz."
25984,1753852,5,Califurgo,12/02/2022,"European style campsite. We were lucky and got a plot facing the sea. Installations 10, bathroom for babies. Quiet camping at night"

25984,1711070,5,Buergit,16/12/2021,Very pleasant place with a great view. Friendly staff. We spent a very quiet night. Approx. € 24 for 2 people and a mobile home (in December)
25984,1702180,3,GijsenDoortje,03/12/2021,"Very expensive for the off season with 2 adults and 2 children! Namely €36,- per night...."
25984,1695260,5,FranzTirol,21/11/2021,Nice campsite ... open all year round. I advise.
25984,1694347,5,southboundandout,21/11/2021,Gran Camping Zarautz is a special place. The view is spectacular. They have 2 Bathroom buildings wich are clean and super hot showers. Good WiFi-reception at the pitches. They also have the offer if you stay 7 nights you only pay 6. Would stay there anytime again.
25984,1691839,4,caropaulovan,17/11/2021,"Everything works and reception was great. Unfortunately, most of the pitches are uneven and you are not allowed to stand across the plots. Shower was hot and TP was also available."
25984,1685050,5,steffiibiza,11/11/2021,"Great views of the beach and town. Very scenic walk down to the beach, up you’ll need 15-20 minutes, first over some steps (steep, but ok), then the ascend is slower. Toilets and showers very clean. Open all year, also the shop and restaurant/bar are open. Very nice atmosphere, there are other campers around, which is nice in the off season."
25984,1675495,5,anaveru12,03/11/2021,An incredible site with views. Luckily we arrived early and were able to choose a plot with flat terrain.
25984,1674047,5,SergeetValh,01/11/2021,"A spacious campsite, open all year round, with a magnificent view of the ocean ... what more could you ask for?"
25984,1667400,4,Chris64240,29/10/2021,Very well placed to enjoy the coast. The beach access path is not as painful as some comments describe it. Nothing to complain about except 27.60 l pitches for 2 with elec a bit expensive in this season but it's worth a look the vegetation makes that the sea view is limited but you just have to take the path to get some fantastic views.
25984,1667288,5,enaandmaraontour,29/10/2021,"You can easily take the train to San Sebastian, the staff is very friendly and helpful, the sanitary facilities are well maintained, the sea with an unbeatable sunset! were very satisfied, would come again anytime - 46 € 2 nights 2 people and van"
25984,1661445,4,KluisvanHuis,25/10/2021,"Amazing view from the top of the cliff. The facilities are very clean and well-organized. The people are friendly. The value for money is really good.(€22,50 per night for 2 persons). It is a 25 min hike down the cliff to the center of Zarautz."
25984,1657645,3,FloraJasmin,23/10/2021,"Nice campsite, nice location and great view. But the price solution is not quite right, relatively expensive. The way to surf to the sea takes about 10 minutes."
25984,1657015,3,Figo1984,22/10/2021,The view is spectaculare but the toilets/shower are dirty. The dishwash-room was beside the chemical toilet deposit and that smells… The way to the beach is steep but what a view!
25984,1652527,4,cinrichifurgo,19/10/2021,"We spend the night in a camper van, with all services about 27 euros. We asked for a plot with views and the truth was that it was a success to be able to wake up seeing the beach or having dinner with the views of the town; How bad, the bathrooms somewhat dirty"
25984,1648093,4,GhettoMaria,16/10/2021,We stayed 3 nights. Get a place with a sea view. The view was fantastic! Sanitary facilities were okay and sufficient. Dog was free. Checkout until 12 o'clock was also very pleasant.
25984,1643106,3,surfkate,13/10/2021,Only open camping offseason. Really crowded weekend. Staff were cleaning toilets shower area all the time but it was dirty due to the amount of people. Seems like a dreampkace for kids?
25984,1628370,5,BorgesFam,05/10/2021,"We really liked the camping. Great location with hiking trails to the beach. Everything was clean, all facilities working. We recommend!"
25984,1628339,1,LaPtiteJu,05/10/2021,"Passage in low season, over-armored campsite, one on top of the other, unfriendly welcome ... We won't be back! I advise against."
25984,1626605,4,Archelon5,04/10/2021,"Very well placed to enjoy the coast. The beach path is not as strenuous as some reviews describe it. Surfers do it with their board and it gives off hellish abs. 20 € acsi card, nothing to complain about except the locations not demarcated and the vegetation means that the sea view is limited but you just have to take the path to have fantastic views."
25984,1625755,2,bluelilly,04/10/2021,"Very busy (!) and expensive camping (25€ for 2 in a van without electricity). Pitches quite small and very close one to each other, forget about sea view. Also hard to understand the organisation, vehicles turning all around with the maps of campsite. The sanitary space was clean, however the water was just warm, I took the shower in 1 minute. Plus for baby toilets and localisation."
25984,1625556,4,banbus,04/10/2021,"Good service, nice staff. We had an awesome pitch with beautiful ocean view and we woke up with the sound of the waves. You do notice that the bar and shop facilities are mainly focussing on high season visitors."
25984,1618489,5,Merycamper22,30/09/2021,"Good camping. If you have a good plot, spectacular views of Zarautz. One night we were in a small, no view and so-so. Quite crowded but with a good plot, quiet. Walk to the beach, tired but beautiful, it is worth it. Continuously clean and comfortable bathrooms. We will be back !"
25984,1608972,4,ingolinoo,26/09/2021,"Nice campsite, clean sanitary facilities, small kiosk and a restaurant. There are 400 steps to the beach. Quite small pitches, everything a bit cramped."
25984,1607377,5,danmccabe102,25/09/2021,"Busy site but still nice and clean, good views of the bay and a 30 minute steep walk down to the beach. Bar, restaurant, shop and laundry all useful (€4 washer, €3 dryer). The other campsite down the road was closed. €25 for two in a campervan (no electric). Would stay again for location to the town."
25984,1599694,5,victormansi,22/09/2021,"Very good camping. Clean showers and sinks, pleasant treatment and large pitches. In September € 25 for two people and a van. We will repeat"
25984,1594718,5,moneschuler,20/09/2021,Very nice view of the upper seats. Well-kept sanitary facilities.
25984,1590461,2,waragi,19/09/2021,"A repeat of the previous review as all the points were raised, not much positive to say. Only thing that might save the day for a night or two is the amazing view from the hill outside the campsite. Parking in town itself is not easy for campers and the parking meters keep everyone busy for a long time trying to understand the parking system/zones."
25984,1570655,1,falajaltrips,12/09/2021,"Expensive, crowded camping, tiny pitches (ours was right on the path down to the beach). Continuous passage of people through the plot to charge their mobile in the plugs. Noise at night from groups until 3am. We had good opinions, I think we were unlucky. Unprofessional staff, very expensive store. Not worth it, few plots with good views."
25984,1568879,4,maikellin,11/09/2021,Good camping advisable. Fair price for the location and services. We stayed one night. When we returned from Galicia we went back to the campsite but there was no place for motorhomes. A pity because the surrounding campsites are all closed. Zarautz in September are still full.
25984,1564476,4,troete,10/09/2021,"22,50 for big van and 2 person, on Monday the low season starts and it will be 20. friendly, some sea view, I'm happy.  also the other camping talai mendi is currently closed so there weren't that many options.  good surf!"
25984,1560132,4,Scrud,08/09/2021,"Spacious pitches and services in good condition and they are constantly being cleaned, a little expensive pitches without electricity (€ 30 high season) but otherwise fine."
25984,1558482,2,Oscarescriba,08/09/2021,"Bad customer service, correct spaces and unprofessional staff, limited and basic services, the queue has been checkout for 20 minutes. The place is very good but it is a shame, because for these things that need to be improved we are not happy with the campsite. Excessive prices for the services and things they offer. We will not repeat and we prefer to pay the Eroski parking fine, which is free."
25984,1558235,3,joelcg13,08/09/2021,"I give it 3 stars for the staff, the infrastructure of the campsite is very good. It has several areas, there are areas where more characters are distributed and there is a lot of noise, but the area at the entrance to the viewpoint is quiet and the bathrooms and services are very good. The worst is the treatment of the camping workers, not one is saved, with the treasure they have, they should have a better treatment with the client."
25984,1557066,4,Jeloke,07/09/2021,"Great view of Zarautz, great sunrise and downer. 440 steps down into the village…. and just as many up again ... better to shower in the evening. Toilets and showers are spacious and constantly maintained. Small shop with fair prices on the square."
25984,1544805,4,Rouch12,04/09/2021,"Well, € 30 a night without light. If you shower and water ... the best are the views and the sunset. Quiet and familiar campsite"
25984,1528317,5,pilinas77,29/08/2021,100% recommended camping. Very clean everything and the covi measures very well. In 5 min the great beach. We spent one night and great
25984,1522985,4,kenna,28/08/2021,"Good pitches, very clean, very helpful and friendly staff, amazing views, we will be back."
25984,1511180,4,Risifu,25/08/2021,"Good camping. Unbeatable views with an interesting ""walk"" to the beach. Quite spacious pitches for motorhome. Correct services (loading and unloading of water), and quite clean toilets. Too bad that at night silence is not respected by some people."
25984,1502679,1,ristral77,23/08/2021,"The best views you can have. but the camping is terrible. the cars at full speed, the maintenance cars at rest hours making noise. He did not advise it at all if you want to rest, it is impossible. Young people screaming, loud music. it's simply the worst you can find"
25984,1484329,5,SteDanRhin,19/08/2021,"Excellent camping, we slept two nights in a van for two paying 60 euros, very well-kept and clean services, spectacular views, 15 minutes descent to the sea and the center of zarautz"

25984,1451888,5,Diegocali,13/08/2021,"All very good, the bathrooms need a face lift but they are clean. To go down to the beach there are 15 minutes of stairs, 437 steps. Very good atmosphere for families and surfers. Surfboards can be rented at the entrance."
25984,1451717,1,Xocasmadeira,13/08/2021,"Nice, clean, quiet, regular price. very attentive staff. buses to the center of Zarautz. recommended. we will be back."

25984,1382108,4,Rafikis,30/07/2021,It is still a campsite with spectacular views and the best walk to Zarautz. The bathrooms comply but could do with a facelift. Too many fixed.
25984,1374676,5,albarnipe,28/07/2021,Very cool. With views and access to the beach by stairs.
25984,1361348,3,SUNLIGloriayLuis,25/07/2021,"Very cool. Always dirty toilets, especially the one at the entrance, I think they are cleaned twice a day but there is no cleaning control at the door. Because of how expensive it is, it does not have a swimming pool, fair plots and when there are many people it is canned, at night there is usually a party for the campers, narrow streets and with parked cars, the reception only informs you about the beach, rest ... ."
25984,1355435,5,ismawell,23/07/2021,You can shower for € 2. very useful for campers !!
25984,1346137,3,FritzBoettcher,21/07/2021,"Space is big and full. Plumbing OK. Staff professional. The location is nice, but if you are not on the edge you have no view at all. Expensive."
25984,1332683,2,chovig,17/07/2021,"This campsite is nothing special. The plots are small, there is no view from the campsite, it’s a TERRIBLE walk to the beach, especially after a long surf. No real atmosphere. Toilets and showers are clean and it has a BBQ area."
25984,1325598,4,SteKohler,15/07/2021,"At the end of June it was no problem to get a seat with a view of the sea. If that is not possible, in my opinion it is not worth choosing this campsite. The way to the cliff is very long and difficult on foot. The sanitary facilities are rather old but clean. The WiFi coverage is rather bad. With the ACSI card you can stay here for 20 €."
25984,1321427,5,xcamp,13/07/2021,"Very quiet midweek atmosphere, somewhat busier weekend. In common areas such as bathrooms, showers or sinks there are some signs that after using it you slip and mark as dirty, immediately the cleaning staff disinfects it. I have not missed anything"
25984,1309853,2,ALX667,09/07/2021,Can of sardines !!! The view described is only possible with a lot of luck. WiFi coverage modest.
25984,1308816,5,lispanico,09/07/2021,"Good campsite with beautiful views of Zarautz beach and sunsets over the sea. Quiet, and in the middle of nature. New and clean bathrooms."

Sanitary facilities were very clean, free wifi works on the whole campsite, dogs are allowed and the staff was very friendly :) Nothing is missing here, the only small negative point - the way down to the beach. It's really worth it, especially for surfing;)"
25984,1290010,4,Lucagariglio,02/07/2021,"Clean, organized campsite, medium pitches very easy to maneuver with a 6 meter van. Clean bathroom, nice sea view on several pitches."
25984,1286298,2,Lanterfanters,30/06/2021,"Busy campsite with a great location and views. however the pitches were small which gives the campsite a crowded feel. facilities were in heavy use and dirty.

We were there for a stopover and paid 34 eur (AC, 2 adults, child) which we found too expensive for the value offered. Would go somewhere else next time."
25984,1282168,4,NilsausdemNorden,27/06/2021,"We were here for almost a week, mainly because of the surf spot, but the place is really nicely located. Mega view. Simple but good restaurant, playground for the children. It felt like 1000 steps to the beach but we loved it and even with the kids sometimes walked the path several times a day ... We'd love to come back."
25984,1277005,4,ggarzon,25/06/2021,"We did one night here, 29e 2 people without electricity. The views are spectacular! Highly recommended, down in the village is all blue zone. Very clean campsite, and very friendly. We had dinner at the restaurant and very good!"
25984,1268222,5,Marisa89,21/06/2021,"Super nice and well thought out campsite with everything you need ... WiFi, supermarket, postcards. The 10 minute walk to the beach is great!"
25984,1262612,4,ElPeterman,18/06/2021,"Good views. The pitches have a bit of unevenness, but without problems to use chocks. Good reception, they asked us preferences. A bit noisy the reception area with restaurant and shop. The bathrooms could be cleaner, but the showers are spacious with a hanger and shelf. It is from the town to 439 steps. Perfect for surfers."
25984,1245875,5,honigbiene,09/06/2021,Very cool campsite. Paid € 23 with electricity for one night and 2 people in the car. The way to the beach is long but also absolutely feasible with a surfboard. But you have a great view of the sunset in the evening.
25984,1245719,5,GORAN17,09/06/2021,"Great Zarautz campsite, it is very good, we have been for € 25 days electricity apart (€ 4.5) in mid season. pets free, spacious pitches. I definitely write it down as a favorite to come back"
25984,1239618,5,OMWFBTA,06/06/2021,"Really lovely people, ready to help. Spaces are tight but they will pick a spot for you based on the size of your van. My spot was sloping and I did not have levelers with me, at no cost I could borrow some of them. Nice relaxt atmosphere and the view is to die for! Bathrooms are really clean and spacious. I spend 2 nights and already can’t wait to come back."
25984,1198360,5,kenu,15/05/2021,Very nice and clean campsite with great views. highly recommended. the 440 stairs to the sea are a warm up and after the third time not bad anymore;)
25984,1192328,5,Bummelsachsen,11/05/2021,"Great campsite, one of the best. Very nice staff, they helped us organize the corona tests. The restaurant is good, the food tastes good. The view is very spectacular but the walk into the city is very exhausting. We'd love to come back"
25984,1189939,5,TenaciousThie,09/05/2021,"Great place. Fascinating sea views, very good facilities. The reception helped us with the organization of a PCR test, taxi and documents printing. The plots are rather small. We were allowed to put our 10m alcove across two parcels. Absolute recommendation!"
25984,1180920,4,tessirina,27/04/2021,"Had tons of space being here off season, but the spots are tight. Beautiful sea view and nice walk down the cliff stairs (490 stairs and really well kept). Beautiful views and the beach is great!  Nice vibe stayed 2 nights."
25984,1180799,5,ToKiBo,27/04/2021,Great view on the front seats. Sanitary facilities clean. Price reasonable.
25984,1180087,4,Openmindontheroad,26/04/2021,We had a space with a beautiful ocean view. We payed 23 for 2 people in a small campervan without electricity but you can pay more if you want that. Very peaceful camping but it's lost a Star because the bathrooms and showers were dirty!
25984,1162119,4,racerdaniel,31/03/2021,"We drove to the campsite without making a reservation, had a view of the sea, stairs down to the sea and up very exhausting but it is worth it. Warm showers were included in the price, two dogs had no extra costs. Washer 4 euros, dryer 3 euros, but the laundry was still slightly wet afterwards, although there was hardly anything inside. Restaurant, bar and small grocery store all also open at Covid time. It is possible to go into town by bike, but there are hardly any shops"

25984,1118875,4,dillydays,02/12/2020,"Stayed for 2 nights, 2 people in campervan €20 per night inc. electric and with club discount. Only a few other vans here but many permanent caravans. Staff very friendly and helpful. Restaurant is currently closed. Bathrooms desperately need updating as they have seen better days but lots of showers, toilets and indoor washing up areas. Beautiful views overlooking the ocean on one side or the ocean and village on the other. Set within some vineyards. Fairly spacious plots with some trees and grass. Area to empty water but water fill up is a standard tap so our connection would not work."

25984,1070312,5,CamperForThree,26/09/2020,"Very good attention on arrival, they recommended a plot where we did not get much wind to rest at night during the storm. Easy access gray water point and chemical bath for caravans. Perfectly clean and very spacious bathrooms, shower with hot water without any problem. Highly recommended! Beautiful views of the beach!"

I would repeat without a doubt."
25984,1055355,5,haizeajs,18/09/2020,"It is a super comfortable, quiet campsite, they take great care of cleaning the common areas and it has beautiful views. The only thing the thousands of steps to go down and up to the beach"
25984,1049074,5,vandreiv,14/09/2020,"Very very nice campsite! Super enjoyable. At the weekend it was extremely crowded, we arrived at noon and got one of the last parking spaces. On Monday everything was totally empty. There are a lot of surfers and mainly Spaniards. Everyone was relaxed and not that loud at night. There is a beautiful panoramic path with many steps to the beach. Back a bit tiring, but perfectly okay. Also the staff was friendly and helpful. They have a system in the toilets and showers because of corona: if you have used it, it is marked as ""dirty"" and you can see which ones have been disinfected by the staff. At night everything was dirty and sometimes during the day when it was used a lot. We paid € 52.75 for 2 nights and 2 people (one baby) on the bus without electricity."
25984,979381,2,paulabeade,19/08/2020,"Regular camping. Affordable price, € 28 for a pitch, two people, car and tent. Minimum services ... very basic. Bar and shop with few things. Super dirty toilets and showers, no one is cleaning, and it shows that no cleaning staff has passed through these services for a long time. To go to the beach there is a long way with spectacular views but the climb is very heavy and tiring, about 30 min. Correct pitches, although the area depends a little inclined. To go with friends, it is ideal, it is a youth campsite."
25984,949446,1,luigi_gijon,11/08/2020,"Total massification, small plot, beach? 35min walking downhill. So the climb to the campsite ......... Bathrooms with apology for covid19. It could barely be used under the rules of the campsite, nobody cleaning, at least in my instance. I will not come back."

25984,913225,4,hmorillo,30/07/2020,Camping very well located and with access to all kinds of vehicles. Care services. Good views from the vicinity. The price per night with a van is almost € 28 (like a motorhome) and since it is a van they put us on a fairly small plot.
25984,906066,3,Fordusha,28/07/2020,"28.5 for 1 night, but they charge your card for 2 nights in case you check out after 12.00 so be careful. Very crowded!!! Lots of lines to check in, to fill up.. Small spaces compared to other campsites. Hardly 2 metres between cars! Very mixed up crowd between screaming babies and smoking pot surfers. Nice bar, playground, bbq area. Walking to the beach is about 30 mins, not easy with kids. Stunning views on the walk. Cleaning done after each person."
25984,891863,5,kadrinahima,23/07/2020,"Very nice, very clean. The sanitary facilities are spacious and very clean. Best of all, you have a breathtaking view.

25984,719958,1,Schwarzertissi,13/10/2019,"What can I say ! So no one wants to go on holiday. At first I wanted to drive again, but I wanted to watch the spectacle for 20.80 € for an individual in the VW bus. If this place has one, then the friendly staff! Hardworking I do not know, because everything is pretty dirty, but friendly. WiFi was great and there was power. However, this place is far too small for so many people, the bathrooms dirty and the floor in the restaurant too. I have been on my 3 week journey through Spain on no worse, louder and with 400 steps, more distant from the Atlantic Ocean. Dreadful ! Continue to .... where you vacation with relaxation, service u cleanliness connects. A star for the WiFi and one reaches the Atlantic after a long march through garbage and people. My Dauercampern neighbors, who all those who did not want it for 5 hours sonicated with his blues and mexico music, we leave here almost unmentioned."

25984,713569,3,Kate767,05/10/2019,"A large campsite located on the hillside. We stood beautifully, right next to the surf camp. There was movement (arrival / departure of the surfers) but otherwise very quiet. There is everything the camper needs. In addition to gray water and fresh water, also a small supermarket. A bus drives the place from the place. The way to the beach is very difficult (about 300 steps). But very beautiful. The toilets at the surf camp are not nice. I ran over the toilet and the showers could use a coat of paint. Very old. Upstairs, they were a little better."
25984,710146,5,Legovogel,01/10/2019,Nice place to stay. Right on the top of the cliff next to the shore. Superb views over the ocean. Absolutely recommend the spot.
25984,709687,4,j0nes2k,01/10/2019,"This is a big camping ground that is probably used to serve a lot of young surfers in summer. Toilets and showers are okay-ish, but dirty. We had a place in the lower part of the camping ground at the end of September and had very much space. The walk to the beach is long, but perfect for surfing and especially beginners."
25984,699186,3,Tina09,21/09/2019,"Very nice site with beautiful views of Zarautz and Getaria. We really liked to rest there you could walk downtown for a stairway over 300. But it's worth it. dirty bathrooms and laundry rooms, and there is very limited."
25984,696550,1,VanWithKids,19/09/2019,"Fantastic location, but the dirtiest services I've ever seen. Showers, toilets, household cleaning area, all very dirty. Not recommended to go with children. It is a campsite for young people who want to surf and do not value hygiene. The plots are glued together. The store and the restaurant are worth it just to see them outside. I don't think we will come back."
25984,682383,2,Ndevrieze,08/09/2019,"Too crowded begin September. View to the ocean is limited for 30 little caravan or vans.No privacy, facilities are poor on hygiene. less facilities (showers, washing dishes) for crowd. Showers are not clean.
Campers are packed. Distance between is 2 meters. 2 stars for nice atmosphere by night (cubanista music). Ideal for young people and nice places for tents. Not advised for quite camping.."
25984,682376,2,TimDeleu,08/09/2019,Places are way too close together. Lots of noise at night. Hygiene in the sanitary blocks was poor.

The walk to the beach is beautiful xo there are 439 steps plus stretches of slope ..... downhill even xo the climb is hard and with children ....

For anyone who is reasonably well on foot, but easy to manage - and the view is worth it. The campsite has relatively small shelves, it felt quite cramped. We also did not have a place with a sea view, there are not that many and the place was fully booked. Sanitary facilities but very well maintained and staff very friendly."
25984,593920,2,khris82,02/08/2019,"Camping with all services, € 34 per night / 3 adults and camper. At night just behind the plot they left a large RATS nest and walked as if nothing, the next day they came to put poison."
25984,585389,4,teamfraf,30/07/2019,"All the amenities. Our location was quite big and we were on the top or the view is very beautiful. Quiet enough at night but it must depend on where we are in the campsite. Access to the beach no footpaths and stairs .. lots of stairs. But there are buses that also allow to go down to town and to the beach. We did not use them so no idea due rates. The kids loved the sea which has a lot of waves, a lot of surfing."

The place is well mixed with tents and campers. Many young people but also families with dogs. At 23:25, it is still quite loud. Accordingly, the place for all the peace search rather not recommended. The place is with 32 euros for 2 persons and WoMobil a bit steep."

Unfortunately we have been put away among the youngsters. There is a lot of noise around us. This does not fit with our way of camping, but unfortunately there is little else around. Specifically ask for a quiet 'family' place if you need it."

As for sanitary, they are very clean but poorly maintained because I made 4 showers before finding one that closes properly and whose coat rack, unique, was present. Too bad for a campsite in this category and relatively expensive. It seems that it was better for women! Finally, nothing or almost nothing to hang clothes. He loses a star because of it. One last detail that is important: the restaurant-bar was very noisy until midnight, at least at the weekend (it was a Friday night), which was embarrassing for us who sleep in the roof lift, so in canvas that lets in all the noises. If you come to the weekend, choose a distant place if possible."

26016,727125,4,padraigl,21/10/2019,"The free services are at the side of Intermarche supermarket across from the gas station.

There are full free services excluding electricity with signage. 
The service bay is on a slight slope so depending on the way you park will depend if you empty your grey waste tank fully. I had to reverse in to empty the grey waste and then drive in to fill the fresh water tank.

The grey waste is a small grid in the center and a long grid ground drain with good direction on the lower end of the slight slope. The small grid has no direction and is a bit pointless but the long grid will catch the waste water. 

The black WC drain is open with no cover. The drain is good and deep with good direction with very little splashback. The cassette tap is above the drain and is a 3/4 turn handle to control the pressure hence no splashback while cleaning out the cassette.

The fresh water tap is an xtra large screw-on connection with a 3/4 turn handle and excellent pressure.

There is a large bin in the carpark.

There is also an outdoor self service laundry beside the entrance with 2 washing machines (18kg = €8, 8kg = €4) and a dryer (18kg €2 for 20 minutes). It takes cash ONLY.

We did not spend the night here as we moved on close to the promenade."

We continued a little bit on a path following the rest area but be careful only passable in summer and go very slowly because the path is dented and the presence of an iron nozzle hidden under the grass which damaged the underbody of the van . But the sublime landscape is the key.

A lot of space, a neat and very clean place. We recommend it if you go with children and if not also because it is very quiet and peaceful. For € 10 a night that you leave in an envelope when you leave, all services including electricity. Hot water and showers also very clean. Thanks Pepiño for teaching us everything with so much affection."

The riding facilities are terrific.

26168,3233350,3,ainaruki,29/08/2023,"A strange campsite. It has good and bad things. We came because it is close to the beach and that beach allows dogs. There are not many that allow you to spend the day at ease with the dog. Of course, access is through a very steep slope and stairs. The beach is not much either, very big and lots of sand but the water is dark, choppy and with an undertow. About the campsite: very poorly defined plots, very sandy, the views of the sea have to be searched for and if you take the van out during the day they do not guarantee that they will save your spot. The staff is very friendly and the bathrooms are really new and clean (there is no paper), the water is warm and the shower is pleasant. It is true that it is also expensive for what it is and that they charge you to enter the pool morning and afternoon. Although having a dog you can't even enter. I don't know if we would repeat this place but there aren't many other options in this area."
26168,3211558,1,Nereban,24/08/2023,"I had never been asked to pay extra to enter a camping pool. 2.5 euros in the morning and another 2.5 in the afternoon, unacceptable, you already pay good money to stay on a sandy plot without any shade and with a very unattractive campsite. The only thing that is good is the supermarket and bar, but the rest is worth little for what they charge. I won't come back disappointing"
26168,3193745,1,OscardelNido,21/08/2023,"40 years visiting campsites, this being the worst of my life. Better slums I have seen. I will never return and I will never get tired of telling everyone. It does not deserve to have an opening license."

26168,3138831,4,bellotobrujo,13/08/2023,"The campsite is very good, the shower and toilet area is always very clean, the only drawback is that they don't put toilet paper. If we talk about the beach, it's another song, very bad access by a huge and very steep staircase, on the beach promenade you can't see the sea, there is practically nothing, no shops, bars, restaurants, supermarkets, etc. I will not return but not because of the campsite but because of the area where it is"
26168,3045074,4,MJero,30/07/2023,"Very good infrastructure. Bathroom new and very clean. For those who stay by the pool, it is too noisy to sleep, for those who are not at the party."

26168,2896509,1,trioMarfil,27/06/2023,"To say that 2 minutes after being at the campsite I already regretted it... I sum it up... I didn't leave because I had already been charged,,, lousy place, 0 activities, last June with 40 degrees with the pool closed, in a sand area with hardly any shadows and the beach far away and with a slope that makes you want to go there...and very expensive for what they offer you...I don't recommend it..."

Beaches within walking distance and beautiful, hardly any people at the beach, very wide and great, gently sloping sea. Small supermarket with fresh rolls on site.

Another building a little further is nice and clean with facilities for the chemical toilet. There is a supermarket, swimming pool (not open) and restaurant, there is WiFi but did not get any reception. I paid € 13.50 per night for 1 person with a camper, including electricity. However, a lot of noise until deep into the night."
26168,2616979,2,sezrelf,20/03/2023,Way too expensive for what it is.  Looks really worn out and needs some love and attention.  Facilities are good and clean to be fair but the rest of the site looks very run down.  €32 euros for one night with a dog.  There are much better sites around the area with more appropriate prices for the time of year
26168,2611392,3,geronimo83,16/03/2023,"Good welcome, old sanitary facilities in good condition and clean, but the price goes from 20.50€ to 28€ or 27% on March 15 for 2 people, vehicle and electricity which is much too expensive for the season, and for good reason, we were practically the only ones while other campsites are very full."

If you need power it is sometimes far away that you need a long cable but the friendly staff provided with an extension. Very clean location at the shower and toilet."

It is located very high with respect to the beach level, for the photos it seems that you have nothing else to cross, but you have to go down and climb a long staircase, so you think about it a lot before going down, and at the end you decide that you stay in the pool, which is not bad.

26189,3156512,4,cdiaz.casado,15/08/2023,"Camper area with an unbeatable location, from it you can reach all the beaches. The staff is very nice, the treatment is very close. A point to improve would be the bathrooms and showers, which are very small and get dirty easily. Check in/out times should also change as there isn't. You can be sleeping after midnight and a motorhome is parked next to you."
26189,3151251,5,AraleNoriMakina,15/08/2023,"An area that due to the situation to visit the area is very good, nice place and very friendly staff, the toilets/showers may need an update... but overall great."
26189,3147849,5,AngelRangel,14/08/2023,"Best overnight area in the area, incredible treatment by the staff, and the area is very quiet and clean, with bathrooms and showers included in the price, it also has a very nice area with chickens, ducks, and peacocks. It has a restaurant where you can eat a well-prepared home-cooked meal. I would repeat the experience a thousand times more, thank you very much for all the family."
26189,3127734,5,Pzhj,12/08/2023,I come every year. And both the deal is very good.
26189,3118889,5,Aroa90,11/08/2023,"We had reserved 2 nights and ended up extending the reservation to 4 nights. We have been very good in this area. The owner is very friendly, he gave us a lot of information about the surroundings and what to do. The area has everything you need and is very well located to go anywhere in Cabo de Gata. We would repeat without a doubt."
26189,3117115,4,Averz,10/08/2023,"Lovely campsite, however no drinking water, showers and toilets clean. But is not in walking distance to San Jose, it is about a 20/30 min difficult cycle on a very busy road! Would not advise unless willing to drive to places. Owner very nice and helpful!"
26189,3091473,5,martilori,06/08/2023,"A comfortable and lovely camper park, with a really kind and nice owner and his cute cat. It's 20 minutes drive from wonderful beaches. We have spent beautiful days of chill out with our tent. The only downside for us was that it's near a road, but we think that if you have a camper/van you won't be bothered.
When we'll be back in Cabo de Gata, of course we're going to visit this place again!!"
26189,3081895,5,vanconmate,05/08/2023,We were passing through for one night and the truth is that we really liked the service and the friendliness. The bathrooms are very well cared for and you can see the staff always cleaning and attentive. We recommend it 100%
26189,3079512,5,hamburguento,05/08/2023,"We were going to stay 3 days and we ended up staying 5. The place is perfect, there is no noise during the night. The owner is super friendly and helps you with whatever you need. It has a restaurant next door where you can eat very well. It does not have hours of entry at night, as long as you do not disturb when entering at night. Bathrooms that are constantly being cleaned and showers that are not paid for. Recommended 100/100."
26189,3070744,5,cabogatacamper,03/08/2023,"As a clarification to the two previous reviews, they are from the same vehicle, they have not understood our rates that are posted on the web. We live in an area with a shortage of water. We offer to fill small potable water tanks for drinking and cooking purposes only. And irrigation water to fill the large tank for showers and toilets. The single filling fee is €3, and the dirty filling and emptying fee is €6."
26189,3070048,1,IglesiasFatima,03/08/2023,for being honest and looking for the staff. We just wanted water refills. the water is not drinkable and they charge €6. it's crazy

26189,3023596,5,javibm5,26/07/2023,"Wonderful experience. As a constructive comment, the bathroom might be a bit dirty at times, but nothing to worry about. The guy at the reception is fantastic. We have stayed two nights to visit all the coves in the area, which are 15 minutes away. Family atmosphere and very quiet."
26189,3008048,5,viajespipa,23/07/2023,The great deal we arrived at 1 in the morning and immediately a great deal came out very grateful
26189,2998029,5,isabel1947campe,21/07/2023,"Simple but charming area, large plots with many trees. They take great care of the plants. The very friendly guy advised us where to locate us, informing us at what time there is more shade in some plots or in others. An oasis in the middle of the desert."
26189,2997972,5,LUCIA1999,21/07/2023,"Our obligatory stop whenever we come to Cabo de Gata, as always the treatment of the great staff and the good and cheap restaurant menu. The trees are bigger and give shade. We forgot the connector at home and the guy at the reception, very attentive at 11 at night, left us one so we could connect (they ask for a deposit or an ID when they leave something for you)."
26189,2997444,3,luciagp,21/07/2023,"They were kind and attentive. You have all the necessary services but if you do not go with a vehicle with an awning there is no shade. We had a very bad time, especially sleeping. Then we contracted electricity but in the plot where we were there was no socket and the extension cord did not reach so we could not use it. We discussed it and they did not offer us to return the money for the contracting of electricity."
26189,2984896,5,AmatistaC25,18/07/2023,"Great... A very human welcome, and a very pleasant stay. It is an oasis in the middle of the desert. Thank you very much Esteban and the family, it is a highly recommended site for all aspects."

26189,2932480,5,Rozucal,07/07/2023,"Extraordinary place where the illusion of the staff is reflected in the facilities and the service. Very close to the most emblematic places of Cabo de Gata where to spend the night and move from there. The facilities are very clean and pampered, The service is ten out of five. I'm sorry, I spoke to the person in charge and I didn't keep his name. Thank you very much for making us feel at home."
26189,2840061,5,Anai19,10/06/2023,"We stayed one night, a quiet place, well-kept, cheap, hot showers included in the price. The guy at the reception very friendly. To repeat."

The farm shows the devotion that the owner has for nature. 100 quality customer service unbeatable price. bar-restaurant next door. Close to San José A totally recommendable place :)
26189,2782055,1,cdulbecco,24/05/2023,Horrible place next to the greenhouses with a pungent smell of plastic and herbicides that lingered in our motorhome for hours. I don't understand the positive comments. The place seems abandoned. sadly there isn't much to choose from in the better area. we keep driving.
26189,2780260,5,swanamente,23/05/2023,"Value for money unbeatable. At 5€ per head you really can't say anything. More like a small private campsite. Attention to detail can be seen here. At one point or another, something could be done again with the sanitary facilities. Stayed a second night. It is a pity that wild birds are kept in an aviary and there is a lot of rubbish around the greenhouses outside."
26189,2747933,5,VecinoLand,14/05/2023,"Very good place and very well located to do a large part of the coast, very quiet place, very clean, all services are free, the guy who attends (Sebastian) when he told him that we had a dog, he advised us an area to feel calm and we had an area picnic for ourselves. very friendly staff. 100% recommended"

26189,2726250,5,xebri,05/05/2023,"Area very well located to visit the natural park of cabo de gata, you have everything at 20-30min. The area has all the necessary services (we did not use the showers, but they looked acceptable). We slept quite well despite having the road nearby (no noise at night). They also have a restaurant attached to the enclosure which completes the service. In general, they have been very kind :)"
26189,2720392,5,Sandy317,03/05/2023,"The campsite has everything you need to spend a couple of nights comfortably. Sebastián was very kind and recommended routes for the weekend as well as always being available for any questions. The squares are quite spacious, restaurant and snack for dogs.

26189,2695358,4,PatetCor,25/04/2023,"We spent 2 nights, nice area and the owner is really very nice and he advises us where we can visit the places around. You can order your breads and croissants the day before. And of course a small restaurant next door."
26189,2686661,5,Bilou36,21/04/2023,"In view of the comments we were skeptical... We were pleasantly surprised. Very friendly welcome and good advice. The pitches are a little small for large motorhomes, which is not our case. You can discover magnificent beaches by electric bike: dangerous to ride without a cycle path. We recommend for all the services offered: bread, restaurant..."
26189,2682230,5,riojaroa,19/04/2023,"Everything is perfect, a very good area at a more than reasonable price, the hosts are very friendly and have given us information about the places to visit in the park If we come back here we will definitely repeat"

Highly recommended and accessible to get to know the Cabo de Gata natural park"
26189,2654141,3,Amadver,09/04/2023,"The plots are good for two people, small if you are more. The bathrooms could be improved, very old facilities and a bad smell even though there is cleaning... shower with cold water. The guy at the reception very attentive and helpful. We would repeat without thinking if they change bathroom facilities."
26189,2653496,5,isabel1947campe,09/04/2023,"We have had a very good time, very nice facilities and super attentive staff. At rush hour the showers are overcrowded and the hot water runs out, the bathrooms get dirty quickly since it is a rural environment of gravel and earth and in general people are not supportive by wiping their feet when entering or using the available mop when leaving from the shower. The attendants clean constantly. We will repeat!"

The fact of having a restaurant next door and being able to reserve bread is a plus. Sebastián is a charm and is always available.

26189,2352645,2,Mostapha,08/09/2022,"Quiet area to sleep one night is fine, they have a restaurant bar to get by, we have not had a good experience, the first day the battery was clogged, after 5 minutes you could not shower or scrub, the next day there was no water, then it It solved the problem, the washing machine swallowed €3, they stayed there, they don't return the money, they don't add detergent or fabric softener either."
26189,2336652,3,franyrocio,03/09/2022,"the area is fine but the washer and dryer service is painful and the owner, knowing that they are not going well, tells you that he has passed the complaints to the washing machine company but does not return the money or put a warning sign or anything"
26189,2332150,4,Saanemma,02/09/2022,"Well maintained and clean rest area. Little shade, better not to park near the road because it is noisy.

They have a bar on the premises, pets are allowed (they even have pipican). Very nice staff, you can't ask for more for a camper park. It is very central to all the coves and beaches in the area (20min +-) We came for one night and in the end we stayed 3"
26189,2263794,3,itzicl,18/08/2022,"We found it very expensive for the little service it offers. The water went out a couple of times during the day and this prevented us from being able to wash or shower at night. Toilet services are scarce. It has a bar, chickens and a cat, we liked that a lot."
26189,2262726,3,maarinapages,18/08/2022,"The reception attitude could have been more pleasant... A little more maintenance is needed in the facilities (toilet). We had some motorhomes that made a lot of noise and occupied the entire area of chairs and tables in the area, even so there are beautiful corners, they have fields and roosters that crow in the morning, we liked that. They allow dogs and have a pipi-can area."
26189,2257199,4,van_anjito,17/08/2022,"Good price, very friendly and close staff. The only downside that I have seen has been the lack of cleanliness in the bathrooms and their scarcity, very small showers, only two sinks, and not even a stool to leave bathroom things or clean clothes... you have to leave it in the floor, which I didn't do... the bins full of toilet paper... it's the only thing... a little more general order would be better..."

26189,2197747,5,Ferroo,08/08/2022,"The idea was to stay a couple of nights and in the end they ended up being 5. A quiet place (although many vehicles pass by on the road in front with the consequent noise). It has a bar-restaurant, and the quality/price (of the food) is correct. You can buy butane, accessories and consumables for the AC. Interesting! If we return to Cabo de Gata, we will repeat."
26189,2190021,1,rosaeg,07/08/2022,"Motorhome area where you can put tents, caravans and cars without camping. During the day many flies especially if they put you in the plots that are close to the pipican, chicken coop and orchard with its corresponding pile of manure. I don't understand why they have forced me to settle on this plot when there are other free plots. Very little shade during the day."
26189,2179202,4,Asillero11,05/08/2022,A pretty good area. The receptionist very friendly. Bathrooms and sinks were fine. It is a quiet area.
26189,2169948,4,Ritaflow,03/08/2022,"We were last summer (2 vans) it was for one day and we decided to stay for 5. An area with all the services, with a restaurant (great food) and the attention of the owner of 10. Plan your trip and if it is summer, book remember that you are going to visit a natural park and that we must respect the environment, we cannot plant our vehicle where we want to spend the night."
26189,2153383,5,javisa75,31/07/2022,"We have been in the area for two nights and have decided to stay one more. It is very well located to get to know all of Cabo de Gata, a few kilometers from the towns and beaches in the area. The treatment is very nice, very comfortable with all the services. A restaurant bar where you can eat and/or have a drink. We totally recommend it."
26189,2150210,5,Maperonda,31/07/2022,"Quiet, beautiful place and a step away from the best beaches. Very attentive and friendly staff with a close treatment. It has a bar with a large terrace where you can even order bread for the next day. For the price you can not ask for more."
26189,2147009,2,rach65500,30/07/2022,"be careful interesting campsite with restaurant 20 m away, however surprise when you arrive with a trailer it makes you pay an extra €5 per day it is not stipulated anywhere which means that the stay goes from €18 with electricity to €23 per day"
26189,2118573,5,caravaning2000,24/07/2022,"Quiet and familiar place. The owners are very friendly and attentive. The pitches are large and allow tables and chairs to be brought out. You shower without any problem and they don't stop cleaning them, although being a dirt floor and stones outside as soon as you step on it gets stained when wet from the showers."
26189,2106562,2,LaPerlaNegra,22/07/2022,"Description too long to describe a paid parking lot in full sun. We paid, ate in the motorhome and continued our trip since it was quite unbearable to be there. It is a good place to spend the night and continue on the way. At least that's what it seemed to us, but not to make a stop along the way and spend the day there to rest. Perhaps at night it will perk up. We didn't like anything."
26189,2093261,5,user7777777,19/07/2022,"Perfect parking for caravans, campers and normal vehicles, it has all the comforts for campers and has an attention of 10, both the guy who attends the reception, chill out waiters who have in the facilities and the owners themselves. It is located at the foot of the road and 20-25 minutes from the best beaches in Cabo de Gata, totally recommended."
26189,2091692,4,josemanuelb.,19/07/2022,"Very quiet and pleasant area, perhaps the bathrooms sometimes lacked cleanliness but not because of them, but rather because the clients are very little respectful and we believe we have the right to pay for everything and the common areas must be respected."
26189,2089639,5,HamezParkin,18/07/2022,"Very nice place. I stayed here for 3 nights. Reasonable price with very friendly and helpful staff and good facilities. Abit out of the way from San Jose but very relaxing none the less. You can bike to San Jose in 30 minutes easy but the ride back is a mission. However, all part of the experience. Thankyou for the hospitality ✌️"

26189,1792873,5,Alexander1976,23/03/2022,"I do not agree with the previous comment, everything is included in the price (except the laundry). Very nice and well-kept green area, they treat you like a lifelong friend, they gave me eggs with a unique flavor."
26189,1774598,1,viveloscolores,05/03/2022,"It is not a nice place to be, discharging water and cooking are €5 and if you want to take a shower it is an additional €2.50 per person. I do not know if spending the night will not be paid but I do not see anything nice to be."
26189,1773493,4,Dorothea2022,04/03/2022,"The place is ok, it's a pity that you have to pay extra for disposal etc. But one of the few WiFi that works really well. owner is very nice"
26189,1760264,5,Jjl25075,19/02/2022,"very nice CC area, warm welcome, very clean sanitary facilities, and maintenance of the plantations at the top. close to very beautiful places to visit within a radius of 15km. very well designed service station. only downside is the noise of cars in the morning."
26189,1757349,5,JuanfranMurcia,16/02/2022,We have been very good. Trailer caravans are allowed. Good place to drop off the caravan and keep it safe and walk around Cabo de Gata with the car. I recommend it.
26189,1749392,5,SEBAS1999,06/02/2022,"Very well maintained area with all services very clean. very good treatment with the client, committed to caring for the environment and waste management, it is worth paying a little more, this paradise must be taken care of, we will repeat !!!"
26189,1740440,1,viajar24h,24/01/2022,emptying of water the most expensive place that comes my life. logically I will wait to empty somewhere else
26189,1736690,1,eutana,18/01/2022,"It seems amazing to me to pay €7 for draining and €3 more for water, they are abusing the good will of motorhome owners!! They are killing the goose that lays the golden eggs!!"
26189,1726059,2,garcade,04/01/2022,"€ 7 for changing waters !. Expensive, charism. Very unfriendly."
26189,1720194,4,BernhardKlein,30/12/2021,Nice not too big place with all comfort. Great starting point and to explore the Cabo de Gato National Park. Unfortunately there are no bike paths from there you have to use the road.
26189,1718007,5,titopaju,28/12/2021,"Spectacular area !!. Very good taste in all the details. All necessary services. The sewage area is very well thought out. Too bad it doesn't have a location closer to a beach. In any case, a good point to establish a night's rest and visit all of Cabo de Gata."
26189,1706139,4,Herbstkind,08/12/2021,"We only arrived after 7 p.m. in the evening. The reception was closed, but we could open the gate, drive in and pay in the morning. The sanitary facilities are not very clean. However, unlimited showers and hot water. Excellent! Sure, the location between the greenhouses is not ideal, but at least we are allowed to stand here and can dispose of everything."
26189,1705467,5,Baptiste8887,07/12/2021,"We come back often after several years in the region. We have our habits there because we are sure to be well and at ease there. For the laundry, great, the washing machine and dryer are professional quality and fast. The laundry is perfectly washed. The most is to have the visit of a chameleon in the varied and flowery vegetation, a magnificent encounter."
26189,1677879,3,ErvinSarkisov,04/11/2021,"An affordable area, for 13 you have parking, electricity and hot showers. Somewhat old services. There is a restaurant next door but it is only open in the summer. The owner was very friendly."
26189,1664003,4,tioking69,27/10/2021,Located near the highway and away from everything. Perfect for stopover on the way. Correct showers and toilets. Very attentive staff.
26189,1663416,1,Pegasus1905,26/10/2021,"Completely incomprehensible how you can stay here. In the midst of a sea of foil tunnels, huge mountains of rubbish all around, slums of the African harvest workers nearby, depressing and only something for those who reject reality."
26189,1654062,3,Karel001,20/10/2021,"The pitches are large and well equipped. But the toilets and showers are in poor shape and not clean, maybe because the sanitary is also used by people that don't even stay on the site.  Right next to a busy and noisy road. The owner seems cool although this can also be interpreted as uninterested."
26189,1624928,4,MariClaire,03/10/2021,Very well located to access different beaches and towns in the Natural Park. New and neat services. Price 10 euros two people. We will repeat!
26189,1621860,5,AiramH.,02/10/2021,"Very quiet, well priced. Luckily in low season there are not many people. Unique but the noise of the traffic but you forget it right away."
26189,1600011,5,tronkomovil,22/09/2021,"Definitely a great place to spend a few days and see the surroundings. For € 10 or € 13 (with electricity) you have all the services (toilet, showers, sinks, emptying / filling). All very clean and very helpful and friendly staff. Very quiet area and there are pitches with shade and laundry."
26189,1598301,5,Luniguel,21/09/2021,"Very good area, very quiet, with all services, the lovely reception girl. There are places with shade and without them. They have a restaurant with menus and breakfasts. They accept dogs. Brilliant!"
26189,1578484,5,Sareta24,14/09/2021,The truth is that it is very well located and with showers and laundry and the night has been very well priced.
26189,1569703,5,Arturete,11/09/2021,"An excellent location, between Cabo de Gata, San José, Los Escullos, the isleta del Moro, a short walk from those places. Tranquility, peace and good facilities. Restaurant with very good food, good service. Family care with great discretion, it is very good, I recommend it"
26189,1564545,5,auri294,10/09/2021,"We really liked the site, excellent treatment from Manuel and Noelia, we were lucky enough to be on Friday and Saturday that there was a performance in the restaurant, totally recommended"
26189,1558867,5,Bushtrece,08/09/2021,"Very comfortable and complete. You can choose with or without light. Manuel helps you with anything without problem. I recommend 100%. The restaurant is ok, a bit pricey but ok. Halfway to San José and Cabo de Gata. I will repeat"
26189,1557660,4,Pereira86,08/09/2021,"Clean area, overnight and services for only 10 euros (without electricity). Close to the road but with little noise at night."
26189,1555214,2,axarmango,07/09/2021,"We spent the night with AC on Sunday, September 5. It seemed little guarded to us. Poorly maintained toilets and showers, dirty and scarce for the number of users. Restaurant inside very nice and well attended."
26189,1549396,5,JaviAlvarez1066,05/09/2021,Great area. All services included. Spacious and well-maintained pitches. The owner is super friendly. The restaurant is very good (Saturday night there was a wonderful batukada show). The value for money of the Area is spectacular. The ideal location to enjoy Cabo de Gata. This summer I have come twice. And I will repeat
26189,1549221,5,rulelothay,05/09/2021,"Exceptional place, we arrived to spend the night and we have stayed a week. The owner is a very nice person and the place clean and cozy. All the employees of both the camper park and the restaurant are lovely people. The only problem, that people are very dirty and do not take care of what is not theirs ..."
26189,1533176,2,rocioalcaide80,31/08/2021,"We have not liked much, dirty plots with dog poop with its corresponding smell, it looks like abandoned and it has not been possible to sleep due to the noises of roosters since 2 in the morning."
26189,1524428,4,Ccardenas,28/08/2021,"Great, we arrived at noon without anyone at the reception but you choose a plot, we left the table, we left and then we paid without problem, we have spent 2 nights, € 10 plus 3 light a night, it has a restaurant with live music on Friday night ( maybe coincidence) showers included in the price. the wifi a bit crashed because all the pitches fill up in the afternoon (around 8pm)."
26189,1523286,5,Iloro,28/08/2021,"Spectacular and super complete area, for € 10 a day you have wifi, shower, sink to wash clothes and dishes, toilet, emptying and filling of water and charging the mobile. € 5 light (optional). In addition, the enclosure has a restaurant next door with breakfast, lunch and dinner. Live music depends on the day. Perfect location to move around Cabo de Gata. Very polite and friendly staff. We will be back!!!"
26189,1523160,5,maminadia,28/08/2021,"We spent 2 months last winter so well we were there and it will be a pleasure to go back, do not take into account some malicious fake comments by jealous people who work in a neighboring Camper Park, come and see for yourself the quality of this camper park"
26189,1521614,5,monfermat,28/08/2021,"Spectacular!!! The facilities, the common areas ... also a beach bar right there (although somewhat expensive for what it offers)"
26189,1520996,3,Moisesylaura,27/08/2021,We only spent one night and we found that the camper area is correct and has all the necessary services. To improve the internal organization and the toilets.
26189,1520837,5,paulikala,27/08/2021,"We came for one night and we have stayed 3 nights. Perfect for spending the day exploring the cape and getting to rest at night after a shower. Being able to take tables and chairs quietly on your plot with services in the bar and live music. A bit crowded in August (more campers than regulation pitches), although we did not mind because to get to the end of the day and rest was what we needed and we were looking for with our little ones. This last night a group of 4 ac of foreigners arrived who made a bit of a scandal until late, otherwise very friendly staff and with all services included. We have paid € 10 per night, two adults 3 children and our dog. The place is cared for and decorated with taste. We recommend it and as we have fallen in love with cabo de gata we will return without a doubt!"
26189,1514715,5,reisefee2801,26/08/2021,Very nice German-speaking operator. We stayed here 2 nights. The overnight stay with shower costs 10 € per night. Nice facility. Staff fulfills all requests. We slept very well and had a place in the shade. We will be back.
26189,1511029,1,eduarj,25/08/2021,"PROS: CONS: - The vans that only need basic services have them piled up in the corners in a third world way while the others (I understand that they pay more, take electricity, etc) have good plots. - Services are poorly maintained in high season."
26189,1493469,5,maikialba,21/08/2021,We have spent a night with the van and the truth is that very well. Clean services and very friendly treatment. Perfect site. We will repeat for sure!
26189,1483573,5,cresti13,19/08/2021,"Excellent, we have spent a week, the bathrooms can be improved somewhat at rush hour, but it is more the fault of those who use them, that on the part of the Area, there are some shady plots, a restaurant next door with performances on weekends, delighted with the treatment"
26189,1481344,1,ManuelOsuna,19/08/2021,We went to change waters. The guy who checked us in was very rude. If he just asked us for money and was bothered by us asking him anything. Very dirty bathrooms.
26189,1477543,5,Tranfullero,18/08/2021,"The best area in all of Almeria. The facilities, the restaurant with live music and the flea market on weekends, and above all its owner, a gentleman and very friendly !! Also the girl who served us a sun .. !! We went for one night and we were 5 with that I say it all."
26189,1470092,1,Cocobeloeildeclichy,17/08/2021,"In the middle of greenhouses, a dirty, cramped and ill-kept place. Rude staff. Frankly not nice. Ready to apply for your money but no human values, nothing in return. Ready to trim the smallest space to accommodate as many vehicles as possible to the detriment of customer privacy. Honestly, I have never seen a motorhome area like this. To avoid? No! To flee!"
26189,1446891,5,MarBarcelo,12/08/2021,"We came two years ago and we have repeated. It is the best place of all that you can find in Cabo de gata with a motorhome or van! Location, services, cleanliness, kindness and friendliness, restaurant, quiet place, perfect to spend a few days and explore the beaches. The pitches with enough space. Light, water, ice !!! You can not ask for more! Very economical! Recommended 100%"
26189,1446309,5,Fred2701,12/08/2021,"Hello, I'm there now and I can tell you that everything is perfect A very welcoming area made with taste and staff taking care of you very nice and clean sanitary facilities and a great restaurant there are even very pleasant areas to rest or eat your picnic I will come back and I will advise you I do not understand the opinion of memeloo"
26189,1436226,1,memeloo,10/08/2021,"It is not the first time that we are in this area, and the star is not for its condition, price or location, which is great. The star is because it has become a sleeper where you can. It is not a camper area, it is a pseudo camping for caravans or sleeper cars, which occupy half an area for days to the detriment of traveling camper or motorhomes. I think they have lost the line."
26189,1431402,5,d8105143,09/08/2021,"Great area, very friendly. The bathrooms in good condition. We tried the restaurant and we really liked it."
26189,1430109,1,ericetcoco,09/08/2021,"Poor welcome, € 18 for a Cc and its trailer and electricity € 5 for the car ☹ yesterday we took the trouble to call it was OK for 12 m ..."
26189,1426309,5,vcapir,08/08/2021,"A very cozy area and great staff! Right next to the area there is a restaurant, you eat quite well and the normal price! Maybe the showers should be a bit cleaner but we will still repeat! It has given us very good energy!"
26189,1426289,3,Jacobroder,08/08/2021,"We spent 2 nights and it gave us the feeling that it was a bit saturated. They have two areas, one with delimited plots and the other that is just a field, where they accommodate AC or camper as you arrive, so sometimes the space between them is not very wide. The toilet and shower area is not clean at all and it smells bad. The attention was good."
26189,1415487,5,caravaning2000,06/08/2021,"Great, very friendly owner, very easy to maneuver and clean. For € 10 you have the plot with space to take out a table and chairs, the water change and the showers. Also sinks for kitchen utensils and laundry sinks. It's worth staying, it's very quiet, and you couldn't hear the road from where I was once you got into the camper. We will repeat for sure."
26189,1408121,5,Miregambus,05/08/2021,"Area with all very correct services, good atmosphere and very attentive. Bar next door for breakfast etc. The only drawback is that it is far from beaches or towns for tourism. It is also highly recommended"
26189,1407292,4,rockietje,05/08/2021,"Nice stop in between. Very friendly welcome by the owner. Did his best to speak a few Dutch words but mostly spoke good English. It is best to come to this place on time, because it was quickly full and a lot of people have been sent away who have to look for a place to sleep elsewhere. Everything you need is there, but there is still some work to be done on the sanitary facilities, especially in terms of hygiene. During a pandemic you expect some extra measures or at least a clean toilet and shower"
26189,1403125,3,jonanna,04/08/2021,"Paid € 10 for a van for 2 people. Good place for a night in front of the Tarragona desert. The sanitary facilities are new, but very small and the cabins cannot be locked."
26189,1398990,4,Irayi,03/08/2021,We were a few days ago spending a couple of days. Good location and good services except toilet cleaning.
26189,1390912,4,Bruxina,01/08/2021,"Some pitches with shade. The town of San Jose 10 minutes away by car, you can park well there, it is a complicated national bike and a lot of traffic. The camper great and very good atmosphere, to improve the cleanliness of the bathrooms. Services included in the price, except electricity. The restaurant next door is very good and on weekends they have live music."
26189,1387579,4,FernandoF,31/07/2021,"Good place to sleep in Cabo de Gata, nice, quiet, with live music in the restaurant on Saturday evening and the guy who is in charge of organizing that very nice. The only problem is that the bathrooms are not very clean. We have been two nights and great."
26189,1382849,4,silviablanco,30/07/2021,We have been two days and everything is very good. Very quiet environment and very good treatment and attention from the owner. With good access to the beaches of Cabo de Gata.

26189,1365822,4,currogitano,26/07/2021,"Very good place to spend a few days, it has all the necessary facilities (only for € 10). We give it 4 stars for the lack of cleanliness in the toilets. We will be back soon"
26189,1360602,5,Tommy1962,24/07/2021,"Nice place, gladly come again."
26189,1355000,5,nafsi,23/07/2021,"Good place at a great price. 10 euros two people 3 euros for electricity. It has all the comforts, and the pitches are quite spacious. has drinking water to fill. sinks for washing dishes / clothes. Washing machine service at 3.50. Recommended to park away from the road, but at night it is quiet anyway."
26189,1352899,5,ValleCM,22/07/2021,"Good establishment with spacious pitches and shade! The only problem is that the toilets at the end of the day are not very clean, but the atmosphere is great!"
26189,1349036,4,Suki,21/07/2021,Great stay and unbeatable price (€ 10 2 people and vehicle) even in high season. The lovely owner. We have removed a star because the bathrooms and cleanliness can be improved
26189,1345721,5,pedroceberio,20/07/2021,"Unbeatable place to get to know the area. Close to beautiful beaches. Unbeatable treatment. € 10 overnight with all services included, shower without time limit. Without a doubt we will repeat."
26189,1345714,5,aitziirizibar,20/07/2021,"Exceptional! A clean, well-kept place, with very friendly staff, all basic services (toilet, shower, laundry) included in the price of the night. Clean showers with adjustable hot water. The restaurant next door looks very good although we did not try it. They have gluten free beer !! I recommend it 100%! It has been a great success to find it!"
26189,1344586,4,memeloo,20/07/2021,"Go on as usual. Good camper area in Cabo de Gata. In the center of everything, so if you are not very adventurous and do not want to complicate, € 10 per night and you have everything arranged. As of today there is no occupancy problem, there is always a parking space."
26189,1344123,5,Flautina,20/07/2021,Charming place with good service. Very well located. It goes in order of arrival but once there you can leave your plot taken if you plan to return. € 10 without light.
26189,1323787,5,DeividFernandez,14/07/2021,"The best camper park in all of Cabo de Gata, it is the cheapest with € 10 you have the right to spend the night, wifi, toilet and showers, they have a restaurant with good prices, it is very well cared for and the man is very friendly."
26189,1319757,4,ElMRN,13/07/2021,Nice place well located to discover Gata Park. The sanitary facilities could be a little better (the WC doors cannot be locked). The welcome can be done in French! :-)
26189,1318885,5,manelpm,12/07/2021,"Perfect to know the entire area of Cabo de Gata. Very clean everything, super friendly staff."
26189,1305456,5,sdky,08/07/2021,"We liked it a lot, quiet and very clean place, shower included in the price. Very friendly workers, they make you feel at home, we stayed two nights. We will repeat again."
26189,1286025,4,davidavila,29/06/2021,"Good location to visit Cabo de Gata. Enough space of the seats, it was quite full, which made the cleaning of the bathrooms better. Shower service and water change included. Friendly staff. Place with a busy hippie air. It has an attached restaurant. It is close to the road and because of the people it can be noisy if what you want is a quiet place."
26189,1285607,5,LauraSA,29/06/2021,"We have been one night. One of the best in the area, plenty of shadows, trees and flowers, spacious plot, free showers (without paying extra money and without time) and 3 in each bathroom. Large laundry room, orchard and very kind and friendly receptionist."
26189,1285165,2,delavegaRT,29/06/2021,"Hi everyone, we spent the weekend with a friendly welcome, flies infested with a shower and toilet, which was inconvenient and very small. and parcel ditto I do not recommend Christine and Robert"
26189,1279583,4,sey,26/06/2021,"Nice area, with all services. It is away from the beaches about 10 minutes. Attentive and friendly receptionist. The only negative thing I can say is that the bathrooms are not very clean as the day goes by, but I guess that is the fault of people who are not very careful."
26189,1276253,4,Autosusmabe,25/06/2021,We spent one night and everything was perfect.
26189,1267834,5,Ramona_,21/06/2021,We actually only wanted to stay one night. But we liked it so much that we stayed for two. all around an incredibly great pitch
26189,1259847,5,cricrigut,17/06/2021,"Super taken care of with every detail, flowers and colors. Gravel floor, very clean toilets and showers. Emptying, filling and drinking water. WiFi too! All for only € 10 without electricity or € 13 with. Highly recommended to eat or drink in the restaurant, very good value for money and super nice waiters. They also organize concerts, salsa classes, etc ... It looks like a campsite more than an AC!"

Nothing to do around though. And a bit noisy of the road close to it. Only go if you are planning to go to the beache in Cabo de G."
26189,1178303,2,nofrills,23/04/2021,Space and price okay. But you can't do anything here without a car.
26189,1178104,5,FranziPower,23/04/2021,Super nice host who speaks 7 languages. We were only there to take a shower but everything is very clean and makes a great impression. The tapas in the associated restaurant are highly recommended!
26189,1170731,2,deepbluesky12,09/04/2021,Reception not manned. Registration at the moment in the restaurant. 10 euros without electricity. with electricity 13 euros. Parking space directly on a busy street. The environment is like an environmental disaster. The area is littered with plastic waste. Stood overnight with three other vehicles. Sanitary rather run down. Toilet seats are missing. Ok as a stage place.
26189,1159645,5,elisepark,28/03/2021,"Shower-nickel toilets for the small price of 10 €. everything is comprix! spacious, friendly, warm place! manuel is very welcoming, he also speaks French and several languages and will be there to help you if needed :) top to have a quiet moment! the restaurant next door is just excellent and there are often concerts (flamenco ....) I highly recommend"
26189,1136734,4,DonKubito,12/02/2021,"Very nice place. Clean toilets and showers, good internet. Close to Cabo de Gata national park. The only downside is the surroundings. It is next to ugly plastic greenhouses and unfortunately it is the only place to walk your dog if you have one."
26189,1136709,5,vavagogo,11/02/2021,A very welcoming corner for pit stops that distracts attention from the constant presence of greenhouses
26189,1129221,5,batman11,08/01/2021,Nice parking space with everything you need. The restaurant next door can also be recommended.
26189,1128453,5,Baptiste8887,05/01/2021,"We had a pleasant and peaceful month's stay there, where we thoroughly explored the beautiful surrounding sites. All the services work well and the restaurant is a very tasty addition. Manuel speaks French well and does his best to provide information and help if necessary, but he also knows how to leave you alone. We will come back with pleasure and confidence."
26189,1125908,4,digitaldesignnomad,30/12/2020,"Very cool facility, the owner was super friendly and even spoke German. Everything is available what you need. We were able to take a chilli from the self-cultivation - great idea. It didn't bother us that the location was right on the street. The only thing that was a shame was that the one older woman in the restaurant next door (which is also part of the campground) was very unfriendly. Otherwise felt very comfortable."
26189,1119975,5,willy95,07/12/2020,Very nice area and well located to explore Gabo de gata. Warm welcome from Manuel who is always there to give you good advice and tips!

26189,1105768,5,arcpol,25/10/2020,"The Camper Park is great, it has everything: good service, quiet place, super friendly people.

26189,1058279,3,IsabelCharra,19/09/2020,"Spacious pitches, it is a pity that there is absolutely no shade. The toilets do not work with coins so you can wash yourself well. As for cleanliness ... they should improve. First thing in the morning it is a noisy area as it is close to the road so I recommend the pitches at the top. Otherwise, very friendly staff."
26189,1034867,2,pablo1996,08/09/2020,"Correct area, nice reception guy, noise from the proximity to the road, strong smell of pipes and dirty toilets. Good location to spend the night passing through to another place in Cabo de Gata."
26189,1033193,1,CarmenOrellana,07/09/2020,"We spent a quiet night, but the bathrooms were clogged, I showered with the water from the others on my ankles, it made me very disgusting. COVID issue there is no measure ... Very dirty toilet and bad smell. € 10 night and full deposit, you can't ask for more, but I don't think it will repeat itself due to poor hygiene conditions."

For using the showers (€ 2 / person), they were not exactly clean and the water from all the showers is communicated, without respecting the covid measures. With us, the attention of the responsible person was quite unpleasant."

26189,967990,3,Jflidaz,16/08/2020,"Good area, normal pitches, close to beaches. The bad thing is that there is uncontrolled entry and exit of motorhomes and the bar is expensive, 2 regular loaves of bread and 1 bag of ice € 4.80."

26189,912848,3,adriasabater,30/07/2020,"It is very well located. Near San Jose to access Mónsul or Genoveses. An excellent deal, since he guided us with maps of places where we could go. But at night it was quite crowded. And with only two toilets and two showers, it was quite chaotic. Also, people did not have precautions for the COVID issue, which is uncomfortable. But really for € 10 you can't ask for more. I would sleep there again."
26189,884447,3,dayo76,20/07/2020,"Well communicated and everything indicated above, however, COVID measures nothing. Staff without mask or partitions and little distance between plots."
26189,881383,4,patryhergo,19/07/2020,"Good place to spend a couple of nights, with all services, very quiet and very well located (10 minutes from San José and close to the best beaches in Cabo de Gata). The staff is very friendly. I do not give it 5 stars because the bathrooms and the sink area could be cleaner and cared for (in the showers there is not a shelf to put the products, the water runs out a lot ... Appearance somewhat left ... And in the sinks had ants ...) If they took care of these details it would be a place 10. I would repeat without hesitation: we were very comfortable."
26189,847430,4,memeloo,04/07/2020,"We have spent 3 nights. Fair enough place. Well located to visit San José, Mónsul or Genoveses. Mind you, if you go to these last two, have breakfast there.

26189,846074,5,Mendigosaurio,03/07/2020,"Very nice motorhome area. It has several trees that give a little shade. The pitches are large enough to open the awning and pull out various tables and chairs. There are several taps next to the pitches. Clean and paper toilets and showers.

26189,751347,3,thegatehouses,08/12/2019,"Stayed 28 Nov.  Can't fault this site for what it is and its facilities, and reasonably priced.  However, it is located in the giant plastic greenhouses that cover a vast area of Almeria - so no views, and scenery is a bit bleak on the way in.  The gentleman that runs the place was really welcoming and always availalbe."

26189,667822,1,Vaini,30/08/2019,"Busy place, bathrooms for the spindle of so many people somewhat neglected, fair but sufficient plots for what it is. In generating well. I do not like that of invoice, and the price of propane is not the one indicated by law. I liked the olive grove more and more calmly,"
26189,666287,4,veroialbert,29/08/2019,"We have been 4 nights. The value for money is very good (€ 10 night without electricity). Rest and silence at night too well. The showers and toilets are fine. It is very well located to visit the coves of the natural park, Almeria and Nijar."

I read that it is a clean place, the days we were in July, the cleaning shone by its absence in the bathrooms and showers. As they are, they should spend a little time cleaning the shower area and they don't, it floods and gets dirty easily. Baths, with doing them once a day is not enough."

The only downside is that there isn’t really anything happening in the area, good reason to come here and relax. Restaurant next door never got tried but food smelt enticing. Some local traffic noise, not much though. 10€ night or 13€ including electric. Very clean toilet, washing up area and separate space for larger vehicles. Usable WiFi included."

26189,422388,5,welikelife,13/01/2019,"I loved this place. The pitches are very spacious delimited by lines of pebbles and geraniums still in bloom this season, or succulents and cacti. There is gravel everywhere so no dust. Small trees everywhere. It's really very pretty. The gentleman at the front desk was lovely. He even suggested bringing croissants and bread. There is a washing machine 9 kg for 3.5 euros and a very large clothes rack. There is enough room for American motorhomes or heavy trucks. Price Seite: 13 euros, for water, electricity, wifi, emptying, bathrooms with hot showers. Faucet to refuel drinking water in front of the home on the sites, the water is not drinkable. Electric plug Europe, if you do not have it there is at the reception for 15 euros. Gas bottles on site. Exchange of books. Great place, I will come back. Bar restaurant next door. A little noise from the road but not annoying."

26189,66251,4,gatofurgo,25/03/2016,"Good place to spend the night near San José, with electricity and services. Wide and flat plots. The toilet and shower module is small for its capacity."
26189,62431,5,forment,09/01/2016,"We have been there for a week and very happy to stay there, the beaches in the region are great :-) Today, a Paella was organized by Manuel the nice owner, at 8 euros including wine and coffee, we would be wrong to deprive yourself :-) For those who like to stay a long time in this region, ask for their attractive monthly rate :-)"
26189,61841,4,paskhy,30/12/2015,"Well located area to visit the Cabo de Gata natural park. The facilities are well designed and the spaces are spacious. Price €10 with electricity included. Very friendly staff, especially the owner ""Manuel"" who is attentive to you so that you do not miss any detail. It has showers although they are scarce at times and also WiFi although it is limited. 100% recommended."

26189,49799,5,beyacos,17/08/2015,Great place to discover the Cabo de Gata park. With all the necessary services for an AC or van. The owners are super nice and willing to help with everything. Unbeatable price!!
26189,47802,5,apotos,10/08/2015,In an unbeatable location to discover the Cabo de Gata park. Magnificent facilities.
26198,3166443,1,SandArwen,17/08/2023,"This area is not suitable for motorhomes, since it is forbidden to pass with vehicles. Great place to spend the day in summer, it is the ""municipal pool"" of the town and free. Just across the river is a very quiet RV area with black and gray water exchange and great views. Access to the area is complicated because you cross the town but it can be done."
26198,2016048,1,Piolin,27/06/2022,"I only give it one star because since February 2022 the city council prohibits access to the river beach with a vehicle (I think it is a success, since the area is small and the passage of vehicles was narrow for two-way traffic). To be able to park, they have enabled a parking lot with a motorhome area on the other side of the river and a pedestrian walkway to access the beach."
26198,1631938,5,calle5621,07/10/2021,"Great pitch! It is worth being here for 1-2 days. Short distance to the town center. There are no disposal options for chemical toilets, sewage or top-up options for water. A rubbish bin is on site, but a normal fixed one, such as in a park. So not a big garbage can."
26198,1473836,5,DavidJaurrieta,17/08/2021,Highly recommended. quiet area and a very nice town.
26198,1438918,5,Isanch86,11/08/2021,"Beautiful and super quiet place next to the river, several parked vans and they do not put a problem to raise the roof. You sleep in luxury with the noise of the water. The man from the beach bar across the street is super majete."
26198,1380506,3,Franjlago,30/07/2021,"A parking lot without more. But quiet, with a very nice beach bar and a river to take a dip. The walk or dinner in Villafranca already finishes it off. a good choice. At least in the summer."
26198,1315816,5,jferfre,11/07/2021,"Extraordinary place. If it's hot, an ideal place to sleep. Villafranca deserves a visit. Buy jerky. Be careful with the GPS that can take you through very narrow streets. Better study it before"
26198,1313151,5,Kankamusa,11/07/2021,"Access is through the town's narrow streets so it is best to avoid busy hours. The place is very good, although I am worried that I have seen vans that even have an external shower, AC pierced to place windows facing the river or awnings and tables set up for 48 hours straight. Then we will be surprised when they prohibit overnight stays... but some forget that this is not a campsite."
26198,1296111,5,loscalleja,04/07/2021,"Quiet and peaceful... to sleep listening to the flow of the river water, while you contemplate the stars. For five or six motorhomes. It is right next to the river beach, a nice green meadow for dinner or breakfast. If you go to Villafranca, this place is ideal for your overnight stay."
26198,1250605,2,GuilleAlkala,12/06/2021,"It is a fairly small parking lot and is currently under construction, so the ground is full of dust and grit from construction sites. The beach is very small and without shade and they do not allow dogs :("
26198,1166824,5,susanaarevalogil,04/04/2021,"Exceptional place. Few places. I went all over town with a big AC. But once you're there, it's worth it. The town, a wonder."

26198,1095677,4,Pataka,16/10/2020,"A good place to spend the night. Maybe in summer it has more movement, it seems that there is a beach bar right in front, but when we stopped there was no one and it was very quiet. No services."
26198,1030138,4,xamascos,06/09/2020,Good place to spend the night or cool off in the river
26198,988044,4,Lolololez,21/08/2020,"Site for a rest stop with a beach bar. You have to look for an alternative arrival other than googlemaps, there are 2.5 Tn prohibitions in an entrance and a maximum length of 8 m. If you can access it, it is a nice town."
26198,970267,1,salolimu,16/08/2020,"We could not enter, many cars were parked badly and we had to back 100m along the side of the river, very narrow and a maximum 2.5t prohibited sign."

26198,629411,3,alvarus,15/08/2019,Beware of summer access with large ACs. It is popular bathing place and very narrow access is filled with parked cars.
26198,534741,5,Cancelashuji2,01/07/2019,"Perfect to sleep without problems, eye! Where to enter the town to get to this site can not be more than 8 meters and there is a maximum 2.5T site. You can not take dogs, we had problems! Some bored neighbor who called the police to get us out of there, kindly told us that there is a municipal ordinance forbidden dogs and no problem, and that there were people washing with shampoo in the river ... anyway! The problem is dogs!"

It's 11:00 p.m. right now and they ring every quarter and now they just hit 11 chimes no more and no less. I don't know if they will stop, but if you sleep in a van in the upstairs bed it becomes hell, and I was in the A/C area of La Puebla de Sanabria. Edit: from 0 to 8 they don't sound."

26232,603392,5,Enricxiku,06/08/2019,"Very beautiful place, with lots of shadows, beaches, places with unevenness or perfect for camping. Watch at the time of entry, it is hard to see the entrance and there are about 4 or 5 small roads At night if you put the light come mosquitoes, but with a little smoke they go easy. They are tiny mosquitoes. There was some human garbage and we picked it up, it would be nice if everyone did it !! :) 5/5"

26232,409811,5,Allna978,24/11/2018,"Beautiful spot overlooking a large pond surrounded by trees and reeds. Wake up early to listen to the birds and sheep while the sun rises, it's worth it! We spent the night here with a full moon and it was stunning. The turn off the main road is easily missed, and access down the road was a bit bumpy and boggy, but mostly fine. I'd highly recommend going to Fort Graca, it's really impressive with stunning views and interesting history."

26250,3039724,1,adrianrslp,29/07/2023,"The water tap does not work. Just the one with the button. The black drain does not go down, it is clogged and full of poop. In addition to what they have already said, the cars pass very close and fast. Bad location."
26250,3029235,3,Carlosz,27/07/2023,Acceptable place to load/empty. Located at the foot of a road with traffic. Threaded water tap. It is not worth spending the night and you have to be careful that the site is tight and the cars pass you by.
26250,2761824,4,JaviRoman,18/05/2023,Good place to fill/empty water. Nothing else. Street with a lot of traffic and very narrow parking lots. Everything very clean and taken care of.

26250,2671547,1,Lusanfer,15/04/2023,"It is a parking lot in the middle of the street, very narrow, the car goes a bit out of bounds and it is a street with traffic. We couldn't use the unloading area, a car was parked on top of it and there were many spaces all over the street. It seemed to me that it was done on purpose. Not a single car in the area. Why is it? There are places in Piedras Blancas for them to do something more attractive, but it is clear that they do not want to"
26250,2644745,3,trillonyotero,06/04/2023,good to visit the town.
26250,2631048,2,aurigia,30/03/2023,"It was very noisy, around 6 p.m. there was still a lot of traffic. We drove on."
26250,2488229,2,vanasturias,09/11/2022,It is not a comfortable place for cars or campers. a pity
26250,2451623,5,poesslp2,19/10/2022,"Everything is top notch here. Great place for supply and disposal. Enough space and not on the street. Normal parking lot. Easy to lead even for inexperienced drivers. WoMo is completely next to the road. We don't understand the negative criticism.

26250,2287110,1,bodysalta,22/08/2022,"An embarrassment of the site and the area, let them learn from Tapia de Casariego and stop prohibiting so much. I will not return to this area"
26250,2131833,1,damifurgo,27/07/2022,"The change of waters is to risk it since the cars do not pass slowly at any time and the motorhome protrudes from the enabled place. sleep worse It is appreciated to think about the emptying and loading of water, but a safer place, please, because in Salinas we are many and we leave a lot of dough"
26250,2048490,1,klauscamper,08/07/2022,embarrassing ouch worst searched site for salinas could not have.
26250,2045275,1,Laikalaserhome,06/07/2022,horrifying! only for water change and fast
26250,1999276,1,RCORTIJO,22/06/2022,I don't know how they don't drop their faces in shame. Dangerous. The AC goes out onto the road wide (which is illegal). Fast cars go by and it's a curve. ACCIDENT HAZARD. I park in one of the streets respecting the Traffic Law.
26250,1881376,2,asv84,10/05/2022,"To change waters it fulfills its function although the area is very narrow. To sleep, better find another place and if it is outside the council of Castrillón, better."
26250,1769755,1,PelayoAlvarez,01/03/2022,"Arrive, empty, fill and leave. Little else can be done here. The squares are ridiculous, and the traffic passes within cm of the motorhome. The caravanophobia of the Ayto de Castrillón is a shame."
26250,1736227,1,xuandeisla,18/01/2022,"I join the comments of the rest of my colleagues, a narrow place, traffic and no maintenance. currently no water"
26250,1574113,1,FRANGB,13/09/2021,"Exclusive area to fill and drain water. Impossible to sleep, cars pass continuously within 1 meter."
26250,1517773,1,PilarZambrano,27/08/2021,"We spent the night here because everything was busy. place to empty and fill. Do not let your children out can be very dangerous, cars go by so fast that even the motorhome moves. once again the human being leaves much to be desired ....."
26250,1514721,1,LaBichaneta,26/08/2021,"To stop, empty the potty, fill clean (that way) and run away. A pufo of site, on the edge of a road, without caring ... well. Thanks to the city council of Castrillón for providing this wonderful place (ironic mode ON)"
26250,1507211,4,mdjpinto,24/08/2021,"It was all full of black water waste everywhere like previously reported, so i cleaned it.  It’s next to a busy road so mind the traffic side when opening/closing your under the vehicle taps."
26250,1503469,1,Nachogui,23/08/2021,"An absolute shame the state in which the services of this area are located, which by the way, are located on the sidewalk of a residential area. Overflowing sewage pool and users emptying their pots into the clean water grid. An unbearable smell. Poor neighbors. Bad for the city council and very bad for the comrades who have left it like this."
26250,1482809,3,charunda,19/08/2021,"Ideal place to empty gray and fill water. Everything works perfect. But as a place to spend the night I don't see it, it is a street like any other and there is car traffic which can be dangerous, especially if you go with children, they cannot be outside playing like in other places."
26250,1465778,1,oscsrgl.29,16/08/2021,The sewage is broken
26250,1459886,1,jga,15/08/2021,"It is free, but I use the utility to change the water and only to sleep if there is no other alternative, it is a street with a lot of traffic, the width of the parking lot is that of a tourist vehicle so the cars protrude towards the street, the cars pass quite fast and it is difficult to turn with a car, since there are no roundabouts. Next to the area there is a low cost gas station."
26250,1454893,5,alexxandra22,14/08/2021,"This area of services for motorhomes has saved our lives, since the surrounding campsites would not let us drain water if we did not stay. We have used many, many motorhome drain systems over time and this is one of the best I have ever seen: it is FREE, everything works as it should, it is clean, it is comfortable to use and it has everything you need."
26250,1443884,5,Raulsant,12/08/2021,We are parked somewhere else and the local police came and made us all leave. The only place to spend the night is here.
26250,1385299,1,Miranda05,31/07/2021,Everything is already said. It is dangerous because of passing cars.
26250,1384140,2,Jayla,30/07/2021,"We spent one night and not to repeat, since the parking lot is on a street busy with cars, cars do not stop passing all night and feeling the movement of the AC every time they pass. A frightening night. The rest correct services."
26250,1382004,1,wili55,30/07/2021,"Shameful ... A street where cars go by very fast, cars do not fit in the square and the neighbors obviously complain ... ASTURIAS getting worse and worse. Both in Salinas and Sanjuan the police come at night, take the registration and the next day they report without warning. We had to move at 2 in the morning. They are archaic, they think we just get dirty and don't leave money ... Paso de cachopos!"
26250,1380539,1,Bullfrog,30/07/2021,"It is certainly not a motorhome area. It has for loading and unloading water, but the parking lot is a street (quite traveled by vehicles at considerable speed) where parked motorhomes invade part of the road. Far from the beach and any point of interest. The police refer you to park there under threat of a fine."

If it is not summer, you can spend the night in the meadows of the loloux street In summer, there is harassment x part of the municipalities, since it is a massive beach and the AC / vans, ""hinder"". I recommend to spend the night the parking of the beach of San Juan de Nieva in summer"

Bad to empty, bad to park and worse to sleep. Be careful with opening the door when you leave because you can be carried ahead. For that they do not put anything. I went twice of necessity. I hope not to go anymore."

I like it here because I would like to pay a little more. Finding nice places here is unfortunately something more difficult. Toilets also full OK if people aren't about to sow them. The loud children's entertainment in the evenings can be annoying but it was ok. Would come again!"

Supermercato closed, bread rolls can be ordered at reception. staff very friendly. We felt very comfortable and would love to come back! The sea: great swell, beautiful sandy beach. A few 100m through the village"
26251,2721953,3,Wesertaler,04/05/2023,"Nice place. Sanitary older but clean. 31 euros for 2 people and 2 dogs with electricity for transit is not reasonable. If you want to stand longer, certainly great as it has a large pool with slides and is quite spacious. Easy to explore the beach and town on foot."

The store only has the bare essentials at the moment, but that's enough. Buns can be pre-ordered. The restaurant has rather restrained charm. Beaches are within walking distance. Not a wildly romantic place like we have experienced several times in Portugal, but totally fine."

26251,2599919,5,Byummy2020,05/03/2023,We stayed here for 1 night without issue. The receptionist warned us to stay away from the far side of the campsite because younger people like to party and play loud music but it was not too bad. Bathroom and showers were ok. Hot water took time to heat up but good. Market and restaurant were closed so we walked into town. Services worked well. Not a bad campsite to stay for a night or two.
26251,2593768,3,AdelinoCosta,28/02/2023,"campsite, clean bathrooms, and place for water charges, in the low season I paid €20.50 per motorhome, 2 people and electricity"

26251,2055136,2,AngelikaSchmidt1972,09/07/2022,The place has been completely overcrowded with children and Portuguese grilling. In the washroom there were only 2 showers and that's not enough in the high season. It was extremely noisy and cramped.
26251,2044101,3,arlenebaart,06/07/2022,"We went here because we wanted to take a shower, but they were cold :( In another building the showers smelled really bad and the shower kept getting cold. There wasn't much choice in pitches (you choose this yourself), because very hilly In that respect too expensive, although there was of course the swimming pool and a good tennis court.The shop has little choice."
26251,1998680,4,sarahschu00,21/06/2022,I felt very good. The price was okay (18€ me and dog). The staff very nice and on the square there is a supermarket and restaurant. The pool is super nice and the sea really nice and close. Only to recommend.

Terrain mostly slightly uneven, but doable with wedges. Bread can be ordered. €20.25 for a 2-person van. More expensive than the average, but the location to the town AND the beach is what is often missed in Portugal. We stayed 3 nights."

26251,1557628,4,PauloGomes,07/09/2021,"I give 4 stars for location and excellent pool. As for the park, it is very untidy, with no defined spaces where everyone stays where they want. To complicate matters a little more, practically the entire park is on sloping terrain. To mitigate the bad points there are good shadows as a result of the park being inside a pine forest. Basic mini market, restaurant and social room."

26251,759444,4,esojcamper,29/12/2019,"The campsite is very nice. Set in a pine forest (Pinhal de Leiria), it is, in low season, completely empty, perhaps because it is relatively expensive. The distance to the town center is short and it is worth admiring the beach houses of the 60's. In summer it should be impossible to stay here, as it has hundreds of bungalows, certainly because it is in great demand."

The only interesting thing is the pool with slide for the kids. San Pedro de Moel is a beautiful town, but since the ocean pools closed it is not what it was, to spend a morning and little else."

26251,101811,3,laurent774,31/08/2016,"Nice campsite, free placement under the pines. Soil a little sandy on many sites, pay attention to the silting ... Price a little high but it is general to the campsites of the coast and at orbitur especially if one wants services at the height."

But there are also buses going up. But I don't want to have them as oncoming traffic with the Womo. Unfortunately, several cars blocked some Womo places. However, El Torcal is fantastic and well worth the drive."
26268,2557854,5,Kakoulilimilky,22/01/2023,"great parking to visit El Torcal (fairly easy 1.4km path or 2.7km mountain path type). access to the watchtower from the car park even for people with reduced mobility. paved access (a bus passes without worry). be careful on weekends it is crowded early in the morning, so it is better to arrive before 10:30 am. If the car park is full, a bus runs for 2€/person from the lower car park."

We didn't stay the night.

26279,2960136,2,anaissmad,13/07/2023,"Horror! Lots of noise, uncivil ""partners"", slamming doors, shouting, voices late at night. If you want rest don't go there. Even when it is already full, people continue to occupy the street or park behind you, preventing you from leaving. It's not the area's fault, but the people who don't have respect, beware that they are a minority but they are quite annoying. It's a shame this world is changing for the worse."

26279,2696820,2,Blacky22,25/04/2023,"Parking with few spaces and narrow. For a city like Huesca it falls short, apart from the location it is not very pretty. The area for cleaning and evacuating sewage is not very comfortable, since there is almost no space between the tap and the drain to clean comfortably.

There was also a group of bottle kids in the center of the area, so we left there."

26279,1720587,5,Bushis,30/12/2021,Free area with filling and emptying water service. Quiet area near the city center. Supermarket very close. It is necessary to bring a hose and an adapter to fill the water.
26279,1715602,5,Lemarelta,25/12/2021,"Perfect for free filling and emptying. There is a self-service laundry nearby. 1 inch faucet. Many thanks to the Huesca City Council but they could prohibit the passage of ALL pedestrians coming and going from the Hospital, the dog run or the Sports Center through the middle of the area. Some fellow Motorhomers empty the gray ones one meter from the grate, and flood part of the area."
26279,1694068,3,expediat,20/11/2021,"The site is quiet, but as long as you don't have an adapter for the 1-inch water connection, it won't charge. A pity, the logical thing is to put 1/2 or 3/4, but nobody has an inch. The rest very well, spaciousness in the squares and trees."
26279,1691867,4,RotecGo,17/11/2021,"In the evening everything was really full, beautiful city center and the Tuesday market in the parking lot next to it is without groceries. Very quiet night. Gladly again"
26279,1689416,4,Beltranejeros,14/11/2021,"Municipal area. Pros: quiet area, shaded, with water filling and emptying, close to the center and free. Cons: the arrangement of the trees prevents us from making good use of the space, I think it is too small. We have spent a good night, we arrived on a Friday afternoon, there was little room left. The next day there were activities in the adjoining sports area and cars were parked inside the area."
26279,1687995,5,lesfillesnomades,13/11/2021,Very good spot 15 'walk from the Tourist Office. In town but quiet at night and free services. thank you to the municipality. we feel safe there. be careful to arrive early enough because the place fills up quickly at the end of the day.
26279,1687455,5,policywin,13/11/2021,"Very good place to spend the night and day in Huesca, 1Km from the center and supermarkets nearby. The bad part, the area is small and AC is outside of it ..."

26279,1656522,3,ukina,22/10/2021,"Average area, we spent one night there and there was a lot of noise, poor distribution to park the cars because there are poorly distributed trees"
26279,1652712,4,pakorrer,19/10/2021,"We spent the night of Saturday, 10/16/2021. m Very quiet (all full)"
26279,1644832,3,Alanouille,14/10/2021,"Rather large place, under trees, the air is close to the city center. There is noise at night, traffic, and the streetlights stay on. Small clarification also on the filling of drinking water: a sufficiently large mouthpiece is needed .. Because even with a thief plug we did not succeed .. But otherwise nothing to report, it is a perfect air for a night of 'stage."
26279,1639744,1,serx85,11/10/2021,"Too small, and it is a mousetrap since some AC had occupied the water area and it was impossible to use them or maneuver to get out. A dozen ACs spent the night in the surrounding streets."
26279,1636837,3,jm85,10/10/2021,We arrived at 6.30pm and were lucky to have a location by the departure of a vehicle. Arriving early is the advice to remember. Close to town with all amenities. Gray water and black water emptying as well as clean water free. Thanks to the municipality. On the other hand a Saturday evening a little noisy by people without embarrassment
26279,1633760,1,davidauto33,08/10/2021,"We couldn't enjoy the area, it was more crowded with vehicles than allowed. On the 8th of October we went to another place. It is small for the affluence that the area has."
26279,1612803,5,CalViudo,27/09/2021,"Great location, 15 minutes walk from the center of Huesca. The services are free and very correct. It is usually very crowded and occupies unmarked places, which curiously are the ones with shade. At night, it is silent. Thanks to the town hall for this service."
26279,1607510,2,iseult,25/09/2021,It's a parking lot. 1 meter between each motorhome. You have to accept it. Good for sightseeing a 15 minute walk. We spent a very quiet night
26279,1603546,5,LisaCorrigan,24/09/2021,"A large site very close to town , with lots to see And do . full services available. little tricky to maneuver large vehicles but doable. traffic calms over night. we had a little problem and the police were super helpful and friendly.

26279,1602703,4,Mireia6,23/09/2021,Good place to spend the night. 15min walk from the center. Quiet place with a small park to walk the dogs.
26279,1596602,5,sendero,21/09/2021,"We must thank the Huesca City Council for providing us with this place to spend the night and change the waters. However the area is very poorly designed. It has many trees between the squares, which means that we can hardly maneuver to park. The water change is located in the entrance and exit path, which produces traffic jams. The area is very small for a city like this."
26279,1595878,5,Emma270674,20/09/2021,"Cannot fault it, we was in a shady spot.  Facilities would have been perfect but we noticed that a few people had a problem with the tap being big and we also couldn’t fit our hose on, so didn’t get any water but other than that thank you Huesca for providing us this lovely spot. Close to a supermarket, cafe, bars and a beautiful park.  Enjoyed visiting your city."
26279,1595292,4,Meigaleon,20/09/2021,Very busy and free area. About 10 'from the center

26279,1551820,4,Hermine56,06/09/2021,"Very clean area, with a supermarket and children's parks nearby. On the other hand, a lot of noise pollution (traffic, music, screaming young people)"
26279,1529825,1,jjuarez,30/08/2021,"In my opinion it is not the best place to spend the night if you need a minimum of tranquility to rest, there is enough light throughout the night, and the place is quite noisy both due to the continuous circulation of vehicles, as well as the thugs who pass by with their music at full volume. We have stayed here twice and there will not be a third because you leave here without having slept"
26279,1518646,4,VitoL,27/08/2021,"Technical stop to unload and load water, free services, perfect!"
26279,1489561,4,aldipa,20/08/2021,"Pretty flat, loading and unloading. lots of trees, very close to the center and very quiet. I think that for the city of Huesca it is too small. We arrived a little late and there was 1 square left among the trees. good in general"
26279,1489252,4,alirayo,20/08/2021,Very well located and comfortable
26279,1478866,1,ineye,18/08/2021,They have fined us because we were not homologated home vehicles. This comment is aimed at newbies like us. And we hope it will be of help to you. Do not park if you are not approved. Read the big sign at the entrance. There it says. Health.
26279,1473551,3,BoKKe,17/08/2021,A fair bit of squares. Filling and emptying of water. It is about 15 minutes from downtown walking. It is located between shady trees and several supermarkets nearby. Next door there is a campsite with swimming pools to spend the afternoon and take a proper shower for € 5 per person. Quiet at night although the area does not give much more.
26279,1469832,5,vegarian,17/08/2021,"The place is great for one night, although it is not the most beautiful in the world, but enough. Of course, if you arrive very late you can find everything full ... Very crowded!"

26279,1398625,5,txudens,03/08/2021,"Perfect for visiting Huesca, about 10-15 minutes from downtown. With shade, emptying service and in a very quiet area. Playgrounds and supermarket nearby."
26279,1396814,4,lolablanco,02/08/2021,"Good place to spend a night, close to the center and with shade. You have to arrive early because around 8/9 it was already full. Right next to it there is a calisthenics park and some kids were there until 1 o'clock but they didn't mess up much."
26279,1391299,5,brachychitum,01/08/2021,"I congratulate the Huesca city council for having a free area with services for motorhomes. Hopefully other municipalities would take it as an example. Very close to the city center, with shadows, in a quiet place and water loading and unloading services."

26279,1349539,4,Hoodma,22/07/2021,"It seems to be a parking lot with AC services, usable with two separate WC taps and clean water. Much tree with the possibility of shade. Walking to the center 15 min. Typical road noises. For one night it's fine."
26279,1349392,3,loky17,21/07/2021,"The only more shade because completely disparate locations between the trees, more those who arrive late want to police to park where everything hangs ..... not recommended for large vehicles"
26279,1347989,5,TheArtistR,21/07/2021,"Perfect area for campers and motorhomes. With parking in the shade and quite hollow. The Mercadona is a 3-minute walk away and is perfect for visiting the rest of Huesca. For one thing, it fills up fast. But if you go by van you can park and spend the night in the surrounding streets. With 4G coverage."

26279,1326212,4,Sanabria,15/07/2021,"Shaded area. We have only filled and emptied because it was full the two times we have passed. Mind you, the fill tap is 1 inch. In the San Jorge hardware store (5min) you have adapters in case someone needs."
26279,1317425,4,dti1985,12/07/2021,"Perfect area, shaded, emptied and filled. I would ask the city council to put speed bumps around it to avoid car races ... that's the only downside, otherwise I would give it 5 stars. You get to the center quickly"
26279,1316032,4,Manu88,12/07/2021,"Good shade, although you have to be careful with the branches that can touch. Wide emptying area. 20 minutes from the Cathedral on foot. We ordered some pizzas from ""La Giara"", they were brought to us very quickly and very tasty. At night a lot of movement, arrivals from other cities, and cars to be Sunday, especially cars backfiring .... I only see the downside of noise, the rest is fine."

26279,1276537,4,lexae,25/06/2021,Another consideration - the supply and disposal provided by the city / municipality is very commendable. This can of course also be used free of charge without staying overnight.
26279,1276528,1,lexae,25/06/2021,"Horrible - If you like being close to your neighbors 1.5 meters away, you've come to the right place. During our visit only 3 seats left, a lot of traffic noise around and whether the proximity to the restaurants makes up for it? Something for robust natures, we fled. To the delight of newcomers. It is probably shady."

26279,1125186,4,melinemoultipass,29/12/2020,"Free area, no particular charm but in town it is perfect for a stopover. It would be even better if we could have electricity. The water was cut off yesterday, I was able to fill it up 48 hours ago, but now only the tap for cleaning the cassette is still active."

The only downside, and that is not exclusive to this area, is the hobby of gardening services (machine blows leaves, lawnmower ...) or cleaning (sweeper) to start your journey always as close as possible to the areas of AC , that morning the sweeper going through the entire area full of AC ... obviously it has remained as dirty because it can not clean well ... 2h after empty area and full of leaves"

But, including 1 shower / toilet (together in 1 room) for 6 campers at that time, makes the experience less for us.

26290,2749879,5,FranceIndiaOnwheels,14/05/2023,Very nice views and facilities to spend the night and learn about wine making!
26290,2738492,4,przezyciepl,10/05/2023,Thank you for your hospitality. Beautiful vineyard! We unfortunately hit bottling time and it was quite noisy.
26290,2736535,5,aislaby,09/05/2023,So lovely we stayed 2 nights. Very peaceful with wonderful views. The wine tour is led by Bernardo who is great fun and we tasted many delicious wines in his home. Thank you to all of the family for making us welcome.
26290,2695298,4,Mutley952,25/04/2023,"The view is better than the other farm stay 1 km away.  There is no charge to stay even if you use electric and you don’t have to buy anything.  We did because we felt it rude not to given the cost of electricity.  Be aware there is no one there on Sunday so you can’t get the tour etc.  The view out over the valley was great, the single toilet and shower is a bit limiting with up to 5 vans."
26290,2686522,4,714greenie,21/04/2023,"Everything as described. However, the guided tour costs from €12.50 for the rather simple wine and olive oil tasting. This will not count towards any purchase of wine or oil. In this respect, the parking space is quite nice, but ultimately not very cheap."
26290,2685813,5,karinfreke,21/04/2023,"We just arrived in the Douro area and chose this location because of the positive reviews on Park4night. Idd a beautiful location, with a beautiful view over the grape vines. The interior of the farm is also beautiful, as if time has stood still for 50 years. Friendly staff, delicious wine, tranquility, recommended!"
26290,2684074,5,Elsonc,20/04/2023,"A beautiful location, with fantastic views of the vineyards.  Free to park, electric, wc and shower. Highly recommend the wine tour and tasting. The wines and olive oil are delicious and the tour very interesting, so nice to come across the traditional methods of wine making being used. Very friendly hosts, great to share the tour with fellow campers. Well worth a visit if you are in the area."
26290,2682228,5,robandasa,19/04/2023,"Incredible. What an amazing view, run by amazing people. Free, if you don't go for a wine tour and enjoy some of their amazing wines and olive oil, which is hugely recommended. The extra mile they go to is incredible."

26290,2568300,5,AlanEnRoute,04/02/2023,"What a wonderful and peaceful place! The owners of the wineyard are very welcoming and hearty people. Joseph, the senior of the family showed us the entire wineyard and he was so nice and kind that we felt as part of the family. We planned to stay one night which at the end became 4 nights. The wine (esp.Judith) and the olive oil can be strongly recommended!"

26290,2497538,4,Hollafuchs,16/11/2022,"It's a beautiful place - when you're at the top! The 19 km from Pinão on a narrow, narrow and steep road were a challenge for us with 4.5t and front-wheel drive in the rain. It is better for large vehicles to drive up from Peso da Régua."
26290,2497166,5,sheldoncopter,16/11/2022,On our arrival we've been welcomed warmly by Bernardo and had a wonderful calm and peaceful night.

26290,2425774,5,NirdiBesor,05/10/2022,"very nice and welcoming host
we stayed the night, there was a single toilet/shower so might be better to clear the tanks in advance 
but Bernardo was very nice and the wine tour and tasting were very informative and fun
we certainly enjoyed our stay and would recommend it for others

26290,2421628,5,rolandmartin,03/10/2022,"Just great, we can confirm all the positive reviews. The wine tasting with Edna was great, we tested the entire range and bought a few bottles. Pitch with a view and atmosphere fantastic?"

We had a tasting of their products - wine and oil - and visited the winery (thanks Edna!) Quiet night overlooking the vineyards. There is a very simple bathroom with shower available for travelers. The place is free but we suggest you buy their products!
26290,2301875,5,gattou,25/08/2022,Beautiful area. After the only regret is to have stopped the same day as some who confuse this place with a campsite. Too bad because it has a little cut the serenity of the place. Out of season it must be fabulous.
26290,2282174,5,ticam14,21/08/2022,a very nice step. very welcoming personal. the place is calm and pleasant. FYI only one shower possibility to take water. electricity available. we did not find a drain point. all this is free! you can visit the estate and buy wine if you want. which is recommended in my opinion!
26290,2275229,5,BuF,20/08/2022,"Highly recommended. A wonderful view and complete tranquility on this pitch. No one was there when we arrived, but we settled in first.

26290,2233973,5,fundament,14/08/2022,"Fantastic place! good level parkingspace, clean facilities and we met some great neighbors during our stay who lend us their e- bikes to get into the village! Edna gives good information about the vineyards and the wines they produce. u have to try their rose! The tasting costs around €16 and is well worth it (would recommend doing it later in the day, instead of 10 am:)) anyways, stay and enjoy!"
26290,2229411,5,Jean-Michel77,13/08/2022,"A night in a breathtaking panorama, overlooking the Douro vineyards. WC and a hot shower available, plus electricity. The owner is very nice, bike available for children. Only downside: the overwhelming heat of the region even at night"
26290,2172265,5,tom828,04/08/2022,We had a great overnight stay here after the wine tour. Edna took the time to tell us all about the process and the different types of wine they make here.

Thank you for such a great time!"

We had a great wine tour and tasting  with Daniel, where we got to know about the different methods of producing red, rose and white wine. Normally they arrange group tours in the afternoon, but as we were leaving before the afternoon Daniel arranged a tour for us at 10am, very kind."
26290,2017821,5,reich006,28/06/2022,"What a special place this is. Right within a beautiful wine yard, very quiet and good facilities.

26290,1790078,5,AliceBlanc,21/03/2022,"magnificent authentic place 4 generations have succeeded each other with a warm welcome. sinks, toilets, showers and washing machine, electrical connection at each pitch. To those who are surprised (see previous comments) to pay for the tasting, I would say that in view of everything that is available, a small participation seems justified to me, especially if you don't want to buy anything..."
26290,1789808,5,Kugelporsche,20/03/2022,"Incredibly warm welcome! First guided through areas for wine production (English), also discovered the Mercedes Benz classic car by Jose and then a wine tasting including their own olive oil! Perfect.

26290,1788813,4,Chris9422,20/03/2022,Do not follow the GPS indications to get there because it may guide you to a passable path for 4x4s only. Magnificent view and very warm welcome from Bernardo who gave us a tour of the vineyard and the cellar. Surprised however that the tasting is paying. More than satisfactory overall for this place which fully deserves the ratings given.
26290,1774708,5,lufizer,05/03/2022,"A great pitch in the vineyards. The place is free. There is electricity, toilet and a shower. The owner of the winery sometimes gives a simple tour of his production and is happy if you buy olive oil or wine from him. A really nice, family place"
26290,1769480,4,Veldhoen,28/02/2022,"Idk a beautiful spot. We arrived on Sunday, the owner came to welcome us later in the afternoon. The next morning we could taste and/or buy wine. We certainly did, a nice lady explained to us about the vineyard and types of grapes. A small minus: the shower was cold, brrrr."
26290,1756972,5,Sammydepammy,15/02/2022,"After driving a beautiful route on the N222, this final destination was like the icing on the well-known cake. We were warmly welcomed and we were given an interesting tour of the quinta, which is furnished as a museum. Stories about history were told by antique objects, including the suitcase of the grandfather of the elderly owner. In short, well worth a stopover. A hot shower and electricity for free. Of course we bought a couple of delicious bottles of wine and olive oil. For what belongs what, right?"
26290,1747463,5,sophlkartoffel,04/02/2022,"Super friendly people, we called just beforehand and it wasn't a problem at all, we were able to come right over.
