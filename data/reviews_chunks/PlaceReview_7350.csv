98866,1378013,5,VanDoleo,29/07/2021,"Ideal site. Tables to eat, river that borders the area for the dogs to cool off, garbage area, full of shadows. only drawback .. all this leads to flies, mosquitoes and other bugs that surround the environment .. but not everything was going to be great for humans"

98872,3250901,1,RonalddeLang,02/09/2023,"Unimmatical mistress. expensive camping after September 1 no restaurant, bar or shop open anymore. the full costs of the high season are still calculated. 1 night with 2 people and camper charged EU23.50. In short, not recommended after September 1."

98872,3022235,4,famdepryck,26/07/2023,"Very calm and quiet campsite, cheap, perfect with a camper. We were not bothered by mosquitoes, but apparently there are sometimes. Showers are a bit outdated and need an upgrade, otherwise 5/5."
98872,3010549,1,Anderetxu,23/07/2023,"Free CP, without defined plots, a buscarte la vida. It has an ideal stream to cool off. We didn't spend even one night, you couldn't stay with the huge amount of mosquitoes that were there, the campsite can't do anything about it."
98872,3001556,5,rommen8192,22/07/2023,"Beautiful and cozy campsite, kept simple, but everything you need is there. Free choice of seats, approx. 18 euros per night, 2 people including van."
98872,2778680,4,nicolise2206,23/05/2023,"Very quiet campsite, €18.80 for two adults, a van without electricity. The toilets are comfortable even if they are not very recent. Very good place to take a break from a long road trip."
98872,2723134,3,dunbriste,04/05/2023,"Visited this campsite after visiting the las Medulas. Sanitary facilities ok, place nice in itself with free choice where you want to stand without plots. The area to the river is currently cordoned off. It's rather a place without charm, hence only 3 stars."

Children's park a little old but fulfills its functions. Restaurant or Bar closed to June 15. Very clean years. Pleasant owners. The situation of the Camping is quite expensive the price. For one night it is fine. The river goes to the side of the campsite but it is not enough to bathe."

Also they do not take card payments. It feels a bit run down and like they’re doing me a favour by allowing me to stay, even though they charge the same as much better equipped sites. It Would not encourage return visits."

98979,3225300,4,trespeces,27/08/2023,"Good option to spend the night. We were there in mid-August. Quiet, just one more caravan and a visit from a car in the middle of the night (it was a Friday). The viewpoint generates tourist traffic until sunset, then it remains empty. Green and fresh environment."
98979,2767551,5,Kasku51,20/05/2023,"We have spent the night of Friday May 19 with a camper. Total silence. Since 8:30 p.m. that we arrived, no car has come. In the morning the first ones arrived after 10:00. The lookout has spectacular views. Too bad the day is cloudy."
98979,2729906,5,mccandlessvw,07/05/2023,"great place, expect other campers and locals who come here to watch the sunset. once dark this is the quietest place we've been in all of iberia. not even barking dogs in the background. a visit to the viewpoint is more than worth it. 5G range and a little lower along the road water points where the spring water runs out of the ground permanently."

98979,863663,2,viajeconosotros,12/07/2020,"The place itself is wonderful, but the people are very annoying. Very cool sunset, but precisely that is what causes a lot of movement of cars in the late afternoon, which now in July is at 22:00. In addition to seeing several who enter the parking lot in rally plan because they do not arrive in time to see it. At night, the same. Surely it is the ""riding school"" of the place."
98979,778399,4,osequer,09/02/2020,We have spent the afternoon checking this site and the truth is that we really like it. For the next outing we intend to spend the night. Tranquility and nature. Several hiking trails nearby.
98991,3248388,4,MathildeCC,02/09/2023,Easily accessible from the village. Quiet place and very good for the night. Distant road noise in the evening.
98991,2897150,4,Bombonesenruta,27/06/2023,"If you put the satellite view it is perfectly clear that the navigator puts you on a path when there is an asphalted alternative straight from the town. The place is a kind of flat fairground, with trees. If you are located in the southeast corner of the fence there is a hillside / pine forest that protects you from the morning sun. It has a water tap and is quiet, perfect for spending the night."
98991,2649659,1,Diego523,08/04/2023,We couldn't get there with the GPS directions. There is a picnic area just on the other side of town that was easy for us to get to and very comfortable.
98991,2398737,4,furgopug,24/09/2022,"It is not the most idyllic place where I have slept but it is very quiet and the police do not pass by, at night the views of the cathedral are beautiful and on a Saturday morning there is no noise. as you arrive in the upper right corner it gives shade in the morning."
98991,1819553,1,F.Clamouse,13/04/2022,"There is no/no longer a path to reach the pinned point. The hermitage of San Isidro is arrowed a little before but the path is quickly no longer indicated and leads to dead ends. Too bad, the photo made you want to but we fell back to another spot."
98991,1569886,5,Jehouligans,11/09/2021,"Beautiful place with a view of San Carlos del Valle. Especially beautiful at night when the cathedral is lit up in the distance! Lots of stars to see too. Next to it is the small domain of a chapel where you can take water (but can't be connected with a hose). Very quiet place, only a few walkers passed by in the morning. No further traffic."
98996,3038715,3,AliGl,29/07/2023,"we didn't find any parking and it is true that the streets are narrow (h2l3). However, pretty village and incredible natural swimming pool. I think that if you come during the day, it is possible to find parking and enjoy this place with free swimming"
98996,1090426,3,yeyevila,12/10/2020,"In the middle of the town, quiet but the bathrooms closed (covid issue). Site to be passing through."

98996,441954,1,Moira108,19/03/2019,This is on-street parking on a very narrow residential road. Only suitable for small vans. I had difficulty getting out again once I realised the situation as not only are the streets narrow but there are cars parked either side.
99101,2221564,4,Sonaea,12/08/2022,"Kind. Very crowded on weekends in high season. To go there by car you had to pay a small entrance fee, but you can also walk there, it's not far. There is a very strong current that people use to let themselves be carried from top to bottom with inflatable water toys. It's funny, but you have to be aware of your swimming skills at all times!"
99101,1647406,5,iobru,16/10/2021,"Great place to sleep parked next to the recreational area with a wonderful river to bathe in, or to bivouac inside the grove. There is no water source, it is the only thing. Parking for 2-3 vans maximum."
99101,861592,1,gatete,11/07/2020,Currently closed due to risk. we don't know why.
99123,2560654,5,Davidverde,26/01/2023,We stayed here for 2 nights. And both were really calm. Have slept well. It is better to use the spaces in the middle of the parking lot because there are many cars on the edge in the morning.
99123,1084868,5,Antoniops,07/10/2020,Great

99130,994049,2,Fernando.vnt,23/08/2020,"At first the place seemed perfect but it is a coming and going all night of kids with cars and motorcycles, in the morning from very early the same with dogs barking all the time. It has a water source inside the dog enclosure"
99130,838684,4,Mulesotes,27/06/2020,"We arrived at 12 at night as a stop to leave the next morning early for Playa de los Muertos. The parking lot was totally empty, very clean, with containers and a dog park. No noise all night. In addition, the Civil Guard passed a couple of times in the area, giving us more tranquility, although it is next to a new urbanization and gave a good vibe!"
99130,397137,3,TievieElzaa,22/10/2018,"Quiet night. Dog park and recycling spot next to parking, so people going and coming."

99138,691301,4,RJK,15/09/2019,"Top location over the great beaches with great views. Only the well-traveled road disturbs at night / morning something. No problems with police, there are hundreds of Womos on the many squares along the street."

99166,3076595,5,jorge_calvo4,04/08/2023,Initially we were going to spend the night next to the port (where the OLD GNR was located). We were the only ones there so we didn't feel very safe. We decided to move to this car park and without a doubt we made the right choice. We were with 3 other caravans and the noise from the cars hardly bothered. Good place to spend the night in Setubal
99166,3056547,5,cyprienbnst,01/08/2023,"Very good spot for the night, breathtaking view and few people. The wind blows a lot."

99166,1794164,4,alisha97,24/03/2022,"Great place, nice view. Perfect for one night. The fox is still there and more trusting than some dogs."
99166,1758103,2,SolineAccart,17/02/2022,"Very nice view, suitable for one night only, a lot of people at sunrise and sunset times, please do not overload this spot, there are only 5 or 6 places max for cars and we were alone here, before 3 other motorhomes came for the night... so there was no room for any cars... Please max 2 campers here... Thank you"
99166,1725964,5,cfriedag,04/01/2022,"The sunrise was just amazing! The clouds have stretched out over the sea and the sun appeared over them on the horizon. Of course there are no services here, but you should use this spot as an overnight stay to enjoy the sunrise from there in good weather."
99166,1644130,5,alma91,14/10/2021,"Mega beautiful view, especially in the morning at sunrise. Had no problems with the police. Only the fox is still hanging around there."
99166,1531366,3,fanchetgui,30/08/2021,"We arrived around 10 p.m. on this spot, a mountain road to access it. You should be careful ! Unbearable smell of urine, little traffic during the night so that's great, nice view when you wake up on the coast. To reach the beach the next day, a very strong smell of sulfur for at least 20 minutes."
99166,1517136,4,WernerundGisela,26/08/2021,If you continue a bit there will be a small other spot only for one camper. We used and enjoyed it! Take care though for your food and things there is an curious fox strolling around. Seems that he gets fed by the people since he isn't shy at all. Besides this is is super quiet from 9pm till 9 am!
99166,1378597,4,hollyandtom,29/07/2021,"This spot has an incredible view of the natural park however it is only a lay by so a lot of cars come and go during the day, so it’s not really for hanging out, only sleeping. It’s also extremely windy - we couldn’t sit outside the van because of it! But truly lovely place!"
99166,1284134,4,lauraandalexinavan,28/06/2021,"STUNNING views from this spot and surrounding, however we couldn't stay the night as extremely windy but would be lovely on a calmer day im sure"
99166,1192710,5,Perdi2xelmundo,11/05/2021,"A small but essential viewpoint from which you can see the entire Troia peninsula and the Sado river estuary. Winding road to get here, but well paved and signposted. No problem for 7.5 meter motorhomes."
99166,1129182,5,TouranLaPoderosa,08/01/2021,"Street spot but extremely calm. In the morning, an enchanting view of the Gulf of Setùbal. A little breezy."
99166,1103804,5,kiwionavan,24/10/2020,Quiet night at the viewpoint of the road with spectacular views both at sunset and at night with the lights of the boats and the moon and also early in the morning with the sunrise. Very little traffic all night. Only 2 cars parked and left after a while. Highly recommended. Top
99166,1093815,3,swch,14/10/2020,Beautiful view. The approach is not for beginners as it is quite steep down the cliff. Parking lot is very busy until sunset. At night it can get very very windy because it is a ridge. The spot is also a film location.
99166,1056344,5,Quieli,18/09/2020,"A great view. We were there alone one night. Unfortunately, there is paper hanging in the bushes. That's a shame. Otherwise really recommendable."
99166,946145,5,MarkusT,10/08/2020,"We had a beautiful night here all alone in our van with a fantastic view to the ocean. It was very windy during the night and because of that a little shakey, but we give it 5 stars anyway because of the view and peacefulness of that place."
99166,746726,5,joiedevivre,24/11/2019,Superb place and a very beautiful landscape. Next to the road not too busy at night. We were able to sleep peacefully.

99188,3057254,5,mexcar,01/08/2023,"Excellent place to spend a relaxed and quiet night. Hostel along the way with which we find walkers, surfers, Campers passing by, etc. The pool and the construction of hundreds of years stand out. Internet, showers, toilets all included by your donation at will as you can. Maybe the only thing - could be the smell of the animals, horses that are there, but it's not too noticeable either. Favorite!"
99188,3029975,5,deffromontfamily,27/07/2023,"A great place, small pool but super refreshing, enough even for children. Plenty of room, hot shower, super clean toilets. Only negative point is the highway and the train which are noisy at night and the neighbours' dog which barks all night and sometimes the owners' dog which answers it."
99188,3028140,5,Jomo2021,27/07/2023,"Fantastic place and people! Hugo gave us a really warm welcome. We stayed for three days and enjoyed the very relaxed atmosphere. There is a nice village nearby, beaches to swim in and surf at, horses to pet and a nice refreshing stone pool to cool down in. You could also order a meal from a local restaurant and have it delivered at the “camp site”. Our kids are already asking when we can return."

99188,2963225,5,wholeofthemoon23,14/07/2023,"A beautiful and very unique place to stay (stone pool!) that offers a really relaxing atmosphere. Not far from shops, places to eat and drink, and some lovely beaches (one is a 20 min walk or so). Hugo, Alex and Melinda were really welcoming and made us feel at home. We ended up staying here for 5 nights… you have to go and experience it for yourself to find out. Thanks guys, we’ll be back."
99188,2954270,5,annie.lb,12/07/2023,"Great place to recharge for a few nights with a very calming vibe! The small pool also made the stay so much more enjoyable. We ordered dinner from Sergios and got it delivered to the site, very good! Thanks to Hugo and Alex for hosting."

We will be back!"
99188,1650234,5,audreycalys,17/10/2021,"As for coffee, beer, water or a bottle of wine: 50 cts for coffee, 60 for beer, 5 for a bottle and everything in the box works with confidence. A place that is part museum, part flea market. Good advice for visits in the region ... stopping a night and a morning hanging out is not a waste of time but a moment out of time you put what you want in the box when leaving"
99188,1646129,5,Nousk2,15/10/2021,"Between the kindness of the welcome and the absolutely brilliant setting, we loved it !! In addition, the presence of 2 horses and sheep delighted my daughters! Thanks again"

99188,1504652,5,scottishcrafter,23/08/2021,We stayed here for 4 nights and loved it. Hugo and Alex are really welcoming and full of information of where to go and what to do in the area.

With our 6 meters plus Camper the Gate was a bit tight, but it worked. The adjacent hostel with all its facilities is defintely a plus. Shower and toilet were always clean. Kitchen and nice hangout areas are availble. The atmosphere was great. Fruit trees, sea view and beaches in 20mins walking distance round things up."

99188,1121144,5,adanyim,14/12/2020,"We went there for electricity because the sun wasn’t shining enough. When you arrive, despite the dogs, you can safely walk in the garden because there is no bell. We only spent one night there, but both Alex and Hugo were really nice. They were very helpful and in addition to the electrocity, we also got a lot of good advice for our trip."

99188,991007,5,Guts,22/08/2020,"After several weeks traveling by van, I can safely say that this is one of the best places you can stay on your trip. A wonderful atmosphere and immaculate facilities. 100% recommended."
99188,901799,5,ym58,26/07/2020,"What to add to what has already been said? Hugo's philosophy is simple and clear: exchange, freedom, volunteering ... located on the Caminho de Santiago (Camino de Santiago de Compostela), his family home, his mother, his aunt, his aide-de-camp Alex (South African ), its horses, its dogs, its cats, its dormitories, its kitchens, its bathrooms, its Land Rover ... all this universe is aimed at one goal: sharing! We parked our van for an evening in his garden and finally stayed there for 3 days! We took advantage like kings of its sunny terraces, its sunsets, its equipped kitchens, its impeccable bathrooms, its Internet, its relaxation room and all the decorative accessories that inhabit this place and bear witness to its childhood in village: bikes, diving suits, film cameras, LP's etc ... etc ... Hugo, unrepentant traveler (Africa) has been back in the fold for 4 years and he (re) found his way there!"
99188,897073,5,Camperlaulau,25/07/2020,"Really cool place with a relaxing atmosphere. The owners, Hugo and Alex, are very nice.

99188,760818,5,emilyld,31/12/2019,"We stayed here in a van, at the end of November. IT WAS SO NICE! Magical! We would really recommend it.

Lots of interesting features on the building - can’t wait to return!!"

99188,684591,5,cepibeca,10/09/2019,"A perfect place to spend the night, it is a pilgrim hostel where they let you park the van in an adjacent farm. You can use the common facilities (kitchens, showers, toilets, ..) The treatment of those responsible is exquisite. Very, highly recommended."
99188,679956,5,vivigeneva,07/09/2019,"Fantastic place. The owner very welcoming and friendly installed us in a small field and then visit his big house where he welcomes people who make the way to Compostela. Very nice house, beautiful decoration. Even small pool on the terrace. ?"
99188,673453,5,Nadanjo,02/09/2019,"Many thanks for sharing this wonderful place here in the app! Otherwise, I would not have found him. The people are so great and also the house. You can really relax unbelievably well there! Thank you! :)"

99189,1456945,3,Josepe14,14/08/2021,"We stayed to sleep on Thursday, the place was fine, but a lot of traffic of cars entering and leaving until 2.00 in the morning, some business had set up…. Until 6:00 a.m. quiet, then a lot of traffic of cars. For one night and incidentally it may be a good option, if it is from Monday to Wednesday… .."
99189,1164409,5,rafaydana,02/04/2021,"Quiet parking. Water fountain and small park for children. Slightly inclined that is solved with chocks. Nice municipality to visit. Sara, the Miss of Inf. And Tourism is super nice and helpful. It is recommended to visit the Plaza de Toros, San Andrés Church and the Fuensanta Sanctuary, where the parking is located. Try the typical sweet ""Argentinos"". Thank you"
99189,1015914,5,nemita,30/08/2020,We stayed to eat and rest for a while at the door. The trees gave us some shade. Inside they only allow passenger cars but there is a parking lot that has a lot of space. Some traffic due to the movement of cars coming and going but very pleasant to walk with the children around the enclosure.
99189,752495,2,terrydicks,10/12/2019,"I don't believe this is a valid p4n. No hint that is not ok to park, but your basically parking in the church car park which I think gives us a bad name. also very sloping. We moved on to the aire at ubeda"

99236,1751775,3,CINZIAontheROAD,10/02/2022,Large clayey area. At this time of year it is not very popular. Beach a stone's throw away with a wooden walkway for strolling. Baskets present. In addition to this nothingness ...

99294,2632626,5,JordiDS,31/03/2023,Very quiet place to rest and sleep right next to the town and next to a river. Payment area but for €4 you can stay 24 hours.

It is a 24-hour blue zone parking for €4, it puts a sign prohibiting motorhomes from 10 pm to 8 am, they told us that you could stay overnight at the end of the parking lot. Well leveled and with garbage cans. Highly recommended to comfortably visit Albarracín."

99298,3287784,2,martini666,12/09/2023,"Would not recommend. There is nothing in the village except 1 restaurant. People are not very friendly and although quiet, you would camp close around their houses, so we would feel too exposed. The toilets are for free when the restaurant ist open. It will get cold in the night."

There are small tables to eat with shade, drinking water and views of the town. Recommended site. Take another location than the one marked, I put it on the map-cerro de los molinos"

We did not stay. The level of non-respect of the sites is present everywhere in Spain. There is still a lot of awareness work to be done!
99320,2537925,5,jonatanpardo,02/01/2023,Ideal to visit the mills and go up in 5min walk. I do not recommend going by car because the road is narrow for 1 vehicle.

Unfortunately the spot is not as quiet as some write here, especially if you are a sensible sleeper as I am. Noise comes from the highway, the Railtrack, barking dogs and from the numerous cars showing up when it's getting dark. I stayed 2 nights but used my earplugs."

99491,1463102,1,Sheilagarber,15/08/2021,Nothing recommendable. Saturday night full of young people with a bottle. The road is not very good and the area is not very safe. We arrived and left. (We recommend the one next to the pool / picnic area)

99491,1295225,5,Imai,04/07/2021,"A quiet place with access to the river. Picnic area with tables nearby and plenty of shade. We did not bathe in the river, the access could be done well by a ramp where the canoes enter that was quite dirty and another access that was quite muddy. very quiet for the night. In the morning there were soon people walking with the dogs and accessing the canoes (without disturbing)"
99491,1129898,1,Bochita,11/01/2021,It can not be passed. We stayed at the entrance to eat. I see no problem staying overnight

99491,1037958,5,lau_lm,10/09/2020,"It is a bit secluded and lonely for the night, but the site is beautiful, with plenty of shade and picnic tables, next to the river bank. Families fishing and spending the day or neighbors strolling in the morning, but we were alone at night. A neighbor told us that ACs usually stop in a parking lot in town."
99491,1031822,5,PipiGo,07/09/2020,"A quiet place, with a picnic area and a path where you can take a walk (recommended if you go with a dog), overlooking the Douro River where you can take a dip! We spent the night well, without problems ☺️"

99491,935266,5,TeoGarcia,07/08/2020,Good access with caravan. Great views. And the bath in the Douro River is 100% recommended. A perfect place to disconnect. In the morning the people from the canoe club arrive.
99491,932192,4,meiguilla,05/08/2020,"We spent the night on a Tuesday and super quiet, we arrived at night at 11:00 p.m. and there was a group of guys doing kayaking, we asked and they indicated the perfect place and that we would not or would have any problem of being bothered by anyone. Recommendable."
99491,908700,4,badyegea,29/07/2020,An exquisite corner. Wonderful views along the river and very good shade. Obligatory stop of course.
99491,848568,4,Mayi6857,04/07/2020,"Good place to rest. Small land space with views of the river. When you reach the bridge, the last 60 m do not give you confidence to continue by the motorhome. Luckily, a very kind man advised us to continue. With 2 or 3 large vehicles the space is already full and there would be no space left for those arriving to use the canoe facility."
99491,605685,4,SEATRIP,07/08/2019,"Quiet, with access to the hiking path along the river (ideal with dog). Place very frequented by locals but we were alone to spend the night in August, leaving access to the launch and local kayak."

99491,461652,4,castha,21/04/2019,"Access is a bit difficult! for a large motorhome. The night was quiet (Saturday no trucks) At the edge of the Douro. It is the greenery, the calm of the river and birdsongs. Only happiness. No height bar."

The locals bring their own shower hose, nevertheless it is possible to squat under the tap and enjoy the hot water."
99492,434600,1,penny13,28/02/2019,These showers have no shower-heads. Talking locally it’s a facility for the locals who have no bathrooms and is solar powered. We are lucky to be able to view this lovely town and it’s mines all for free. Maybe use our own facilities ;)
99492,375186,4,roadtrip-moto.com,16/09/2018,Clean overall. Thank you very much for the place.
99496,2831470,4,WillSexton,08/06/2023,We stopped here for an incredibly quiet dip in the lake. Very tranquil
99496,2716748,4,ennynatz,02/05/2023,"Unfortunately we couldn't find the old bridge anymore, the water of the river was too high. The road suddenly stopped (as can be seen in the picture) and led into the water. The space was great for our dogs, no people came and the night was super quiet. The place is recommended."

99502,951474,4,Sergiowski,11/08/2020,"Just opposite there is a campsite as an alternative, but spend a good night there, shady trees and a quiet area. In the morning some traffic that can wake you up but at night there is not much. Very close to the center."

99504,3163635,2,bernyie,16/08/2023,"Park fenced and guarded by a security service: it is closed to the public from 10 p.m. until morning. The place is ideal for stretching your legs and admiring the view of the adjacent city but not for anything else. Parking at the entrance large enough for the size of the park, but on a slight slope, facing a factory and a noisy road."
99504,2640507,5,FurguiRoque,05/04/2023,"Area of pine forests, quiet, views of the border arches, we spent the night without problems 2 vw Californias, Once past the entrance gate it is a dirt road, Circular."

It's great here, this area is huge and with great night (and daytime I imagine) views. Take care of this site, be clean and civic"
99504,2535866,4,Tojoloto,31/12/2022,"It's not bad to spend the night, with the image of the town in the background. It is the best I have found in this town. The area is quite big. The cars of the road that passes nearby are heard."
99504,2077165,4,CynthiaRequena,15/07/2022,"It is just as you enter Arcos, entering through a power pole and a gate. There was no one else staying overnight. quiet place with many people walking or running. It is shady and further into the pine forests it is flatter and there are beautiful views of Arcos. There's no water"
99504,1797040,4,Ratapoil69,27/03/2022,"large pine forest frequented by joggers and, on weekends, by a few young revelers. Magnificent view of Arcos by day. No services. Access through a large gate on the right of a large electrical transformer."

99507,1295423,4,kayzin,04/07/2021,The gps will take you into Uncastillo through very small roads but you can also go around the town until the dust road along the lake. There’s just enough space for a small tent next to the water. You can hear the water pump. There was some passage of walkers in the morning but we’ve had a quiet night in a beautiful place.
99507,610721,1,jld272,08/08/2019,Road too narrow. Just for a car and again ...
99508,2679365,1,juliakmoore,18/04/2023,"beware P4N navigation - it tried to take us along a 'no entry' road. Ended up parking in a large nearby carpark, for a day visit. cant comment on listed location."

99508,2445938,4,5reisende,16/10/2022,"A really nice space for smaller vehicles with a great view. At night it is very quiet and the evening on the wall is fantastic. Mini campers are no problem, neither are smaller vans."
99508,2418050,4,wexs31,02/10/2022,"A lot of people in the evening do not hesitate to go higher, small places will be available. Very pleasant magnificent view morning and evening perfect to spend an evening. City to visit"
99508,2213730,4,Ferroo,11/08/2022,"Good place to park and visit the center. Of course, if you find a place, because it is very small. Even so, we have been lucky and with our AC we have entered, and parked without problem. Now, I repeat, we were lucky that the first space on the left was free and we parked there. I would not stay to sleep, it has all the earmarks of being a meeting place (and bottle) for young people."
99508,2207586,3,Combo4,10/08/2022,"We spent two nights. Seats 10 or 12. First good, second quite busy (couples, kids with cars and music...) Not a good place for weekends or holidays. You have a litter bin, a fountain 300 m away towards the bridge and a small wall that borders the viewpoint, perfect as a seat. The views are worth it and the proximity to the town is also worth it, a few minutes' walk. Assess pros and cons."
99508,2097653,1,Edithb10,20/07/2022,"Very very small parking lot, it is not a parking lot for vans. It is more convenient to stop in the large parking lot just before"
99508,2086270,4,eveparking,17/07/2022,Azarquiel Parking. Good parking to leave the caravan for a few hours and tour Toledo.
99508,2000053,2,Aurel2759,22/06/2022,"Very small parking lot on the cob, with cars it is already difficult to pass with the van, but impossible to park without encroaching on the passage. Also a lot of people squat their car at 00:30… we left"
99508,1998962,5,Mempasmal17,21/06/2022,"Superb view of the Alcazar. Very quiet at night. On the other hand, reserved for vans or vans of 5.5 max."
99508,1908368,4,alessandromaria6180,22/05/2022,"On entering the city on the left just before the bridge all the motorhomes were parked at the bottom of the car park near the river. You are just under the old town, small path to the left of the car park which joins Toledo by the old bridge. Perfect night. We advise you before visiting Toledo to spend the evening at the Puy du Fou with magnificent Spanish shows on the history of the City."
99508,1869875,4,txistufly,04/05/2022,"We were very lucky to get into the 6 meter camper, there is hardly a chance for that. Great for small vans, very good location, good five and quiet place. It doesn’t seem like a better option than sleeping there"
99508,1706411,4,Leonhymer,08/12/2021,Pretty seen but filled with cars and I don't think a vehicle over 5.50 goes through the seats without getting in the way.
99508,1652817,4,flixenchar,19/10/2021,"Very nice views from this spot. Not sure camping is permitted (but no sign stating that it isn’t permitted like at the big parking place near here). We stayed 1 night without problems, bit of noise from the road but ok. For small vans only, big campingcars will not fit."
99508,1304015,5,Julienvacher,07/07/2021,Beautiful place to spend a night. The view is superb.
99508,1103981,3,ezezaguna,24/10/2020,"A very nice place to spend the night, but from 1:00 to 6:30 in the morning there were people drinking and playing music in their cars. The views are magnificent, it is worth the noise at night."
99508,454544,3,nuquiviajera,14/04/2019,The place itself is great for parking the van and even for the night. Very close to the city and next to the river. We leave it parked there during the day to visit Toledo. When we returned in the afternoon to continue with our way we found the lock of the side door forced and a wheel of the same side punctured.
99508,408821,5,Pauet,19/11/2018,With our fur of 5m we were fine. The best views and the proximity to Toledo. Starting the visit entering the Alcantara bridge is very cool.
99508,400596,5,juliocabmer,28/10/2018,Good place to sleep Au that on foot of highway not much noise. Very nice views of the city
99515,2548351,3,timmerbackaj,10/01/2023,"We did spent day here. Not too much space, but we parked to the right side near the water tap. Good mobile connection and wonderful view."

99533,2601897,3,mevrKlaas,07/03/2023,"Good spot indeed, though for our 7 mtrs motor home a bit small. So we parked at the backside of the Lidl on the footpath, and in no-time were totally surrounded by cars: parents picking up kids, by the thousands. Traffic went on far into the night.  We moved to a more spacious -and quieter- parking space: 45 Carrer de Fontajou."
99533,2526745,3,rucola,23/12/2022,"Only for vans up to a maximum of 6 m, normal car parking bags. Nice area, close to kitchen gardens. A good 20 minute walk to the old town. Strange people hang around there. They tried to steal our bikes from the back of the carrier at night, but we noticed. During the day, admittedly in an inattentive moment, 2 mobile phones were stolen from us, so be careful. Otherwise really a good place."
99533,2292714,4,OsaPolar,23/08/2022,Quiet and shaded parking. Close to town and next to supermarkets and McDonald's. Little crowded. We had a quiet night.
99533,2063063,5,desirizos,12/07/2022,"Free parking and plenty of spaces, shaded and park behind. near La Devesa and ideal for getting to know the city of Gerona. We spent a night in the middle of July and it is very quiet. McDonald's and supermarket next door."

99533,1850903,3,howecamp,24/04/2022,"Great parking area. We parked outside Burger King, on the public carpark area, right next to a park. That BK closes at 11.30pm is even better. For cars or campervans, I think, although I did see a motorhome further down the carpark. Many lots."
99533,1657936,5,joaquincaballero,23/10/2021,A great place to sleep a night or two very quiet with supermarkets next door and fast food restaurants 100% recommended for a quick night since the motorhome area is 1 km from this car park and it would be convenient if we all use the car park. motorhomes which is free and there is also to fill and empty the waters
99533,1255317,1,SPQR56,14/06/2021,Please remove electricity symbol. AC batteries cannot be charged. It only serves to mislead.
99533,434459,1,Weilauto,28/02/2019,2 hours limit and a parking control. No way to stay longer than that... Maybe new
99546,1838958,4,Dr.Slump,19/04/2022,"Laxe, which is the town where the car park is, is a beautiful town, with a huge and clean beach. If the town is celebrating, as I have read in another comment, do not expect them to turn off the orchestra and music so you can sleep. The road passes nearby, it is not a motorway, it is a regional one. There are barbecues and benches nearby. The beach is very close."
99546,1423314,4,timeless_travelers,08/08/2021,"We parked here after seeing over 30 motorhomes and vans packed tightly in the popular beach parking. Not the most beautiful place to park, but flat and empty and a short walk to the main part of town.  There is a small walkway at the side of the football field that leads you directly to the beach. Water fountains and showers on the way there."

99546,630473,1,KemaoB,15/08/2019,"We had to flee the port's parking lot because of the brutal volume of the orchestra of the parties, they gave us 5 in the morning without being able to sleep ... when we finally got it, some funny person pounded the car giving us a big scare. In the morning we found that the windshield wipers had been lifted, luckily without seemingly breaking anything. I recommend avoiding this town."

99600,1581991,5,Marcopolo54,15/09/2021,"Superb view, absolute silence, and the possibility of being horizontal. A very good night on this site. Access requires a little ground clearance, and good traction in wet weather. U-turn without problem on the platform with our 8.20m. 4G access. Don't forget to take the dirt road on the left, just after the (nice) belvedere on the right."

99603,1794841,3,Tartaruga02,25/03/2022,"We fill and empty water for only €1. We were served by a very nice guy from the truck shop next door. The closest and ideal for those who spend the night in the area of Mazarrón, Isla Plana and La Azohia"

99603,1724363,3,Frochereisen,03/01/2022,"Quite noisy in the morning due to the neighboring factories. Considering that my tank is 30 liters, the price of 5 euros for filling it is downright cosmic for me."
99603,1709943,5,alp352,14/12/2021,"It was free, it is now 5 €, for all the services (night, water, toilet and gray water changes), not just for 100l of water as mentioned above. very convenient"

When we asked why there was no information about this (a sign for example) she got really pissed of and told us it was normal to come in and ask first. So we left without water and for sure we‘ll never come here again!
99603,1702127,1,Uschnak,03/12/2021,"There is no wifi here, only if you are standing directly at the gas station. A very rude person works there. You can spend the night here, it's a bit loud."
99603,1698878,4,VoyagerNCC74656,27/11/2021,"I like that every motorhome spot has their own fresh water tap, so you don‘t have to wait for half an hour when someone fills a huge tank. Easy to reach and maneuver, even with large vehicles."
99603,1698301,4,Ouryellowvan,26/11/2021,"Service area with loading and unloading, electricity is €5.35 for 24 hours and showers are €3.5 per person.

99603,1528318,5,Alfiococo,29/08/2021,"Parking for 9 motorhomes. Grays pouring in truck pressure machine that has sewer underneath. Sewage and clean filling in a shed next to it, you can see the white toilet where to put the pot and the hoses for the clean ones. I think you have to pay for electricity, I think 3 euros. The gas station has a cafeteria and a shop and is open 24 hours a day. The truth is very very good. Recommendable."

Empowers the customer to leave his passage to the showers/wc clean behind him. Well defined pitch on gravel and flat. Different sizes available.
99617,2828699,4,flaedi,07/06/2023,"Very nicely landscaped parking space with washing-up facilities, shower, toilet, gray water disposal and fresh water for €15/night. One star deduction because of the lack of cleanliness in the two shower stalls (green residues on both tubs that were not cleaned accordingly)."

99617,2801284,4,domiheyLA,30/05/2023,"The camping ground is very good (facilities clean, spaces well laid out, etc.) and the owners are very friendly. However there is unbearable noise during the night and in the morning (barking dogs, pigeons, irrigation system, workers nearby). No relaxation possible if you are sensitive to such noise."
99617,2797499,5,chrisandamber,29/05/2023,"Wonderful site! The host is very friendly. The main gate is beautiful and what a treat behind it! The area is very secluded and sites are good size. Accommodations are nice and clean  - toilets, showers, washing machines, drying racks and dryer available. A chicken greeted us at wake up and appreciated our compost scraps ;) I’m not sure the nearby town has much to offer but only 20 minutes outside of Lagos, this was a perfect spot for us."

99617,2754498,5,BduS,16/05/2023,"A well cared for CP. The pitches are terraced, well level and gravelled. Vary in size. Large campers (>8m) can park here. The sanitary facilities are clean but could be a bit more solid. There is a lovely veranda. Supermarket within walking distance. Cycling to Lagos = 15km but partly along the N125. On arrival, drive in a straight line via the ""R. 25 de Abril"" up high to avoid tight bends."
99617,2746745,5,Charenthe,13/05/2023,"Very comfortable place with generous and flowery pitches. In addition, the reception is very friendly. Very good location."

Top notch hospitality and service. Always dedicated, Alexandre takes great care of his residents. Sanitary block always very clean. Playground for children, washing machines, dryers available. Excellent atmosphere. Recommended campsite."
99617,2702278,5,Stv88,28/04/2023,beautiful and quiet place (in the distance towards roosters and dogs). each parking space has a connection to electricity and water. clean toilets and possibility to wash dirty laundry. there is also the company of a hen which is the place's mascot. we had a great time with our VW California and the space was sufficient.
99617,2663104,5,Douddawn,11/04/2023,"Many thanks to Alexandre for his welcome. He speaks French very well. Very well maintained place, trees, flowers, and even parakeets. Small visit of the hen at the end of the afternoon. In short, you can only have a good stay…"

The place is very nicely laid out, the operator is nice and there is a barbecue area and various other options. One star deduction because the place is far off the beaten path. Otherwise great"

Never mind, Alexandre guided us by phone until we arrived at the gate! Beautiful pitches, quiet, clean, impeccable sanitary facilities. In short, we loved it. THANKS."
99617,2590191,5,Henrythecrafter,25/02/2023,We called in advance and asked if it would be possible to just shower. The operator was very nice and said it was possible for €2 per person. Showers were very clean and the rest of the place is very well maintained.
99617,2549344,3,dorisjuergen,11/01/2023,"We knew the place from December (there was expansion work for large mobiles that made the place uneasy), now in early January the place costs 2 € more - but nothing has changed in the services! At night the place is quiet until around 7:00, then work starts in the neighboring company - at noon the boss and his family members work - quiet looks different!"
99617,2549055,3,fredletaz,11/01/2023,fairly eccentric area. location small narrow aisles tricky maneuvers. payment on arrival and only in cash or we come to knock on your door to claim your due. confidence reigns. many carists installed for the winter alone in the world. if you like peace and a bit of privacy go your way. showers and toilets ok
99617,2546932,3,doggoontour,08/01/2023,"Has everything you need, hygiene ok but could be better. We didn't feel particularly comfortable with the ""bourgeois flair"" with, for example, the various prohibition signs (do not use the bathroom for more than 15 minutes, otherwise you will be evicted). French was spoken almost exclusively, visitors (50+) kept to themselves, dogs only on a leash. Narrow paths, you have to maneuver a lot. It was just not for us"
99617,2536841,4,slyfry,01/01/2023,wonderful place for a stopover for the night! you do have to drive through a small and narrow town to get to it but otherwise great!

99617,2509646,4,Vanessa071988,30/11/2022,"Very nice place, quite narrow, but no problem with a van & there were also many large mobile homes there. Good supply and disposal. A point deduction because of the sanitary facilities, they are ok, but not the best. Super friendly owner. 13€ including all."
99617,2504068,4,B.Niebroek,24/11/2022,"nice quiet motorhome, friendly owner. shops and cafe / restaurant within walking distance. The places are quite narrow, it is tight to put a chair and table outside. There is no soap after using the toilet and a separate place for hand washing is missing when you do your hand washing at the washing-up area, you get comments from the people. This camper place is still under development."
99617,2503978,4,GerdaPfaff,23/11/2022,"The course was created with great attention to detail. Unfortunately, the pitches are so narrow that it is impossible to open the awning. Also, the place is quite far from everything. Almost nothing can be reached on foot. I still give 4 stars because it is very comfortable, clean and nicely laid out. If you don't care about the small flaws, you're in good hands here."
99617,2499834,5,marioZeuner,19/11/2022,"Super nice pitch for 13 euros including electricity and sanitary facilities. 4 euros for washing machine and 4 euros for dryer. Quiet and centrally located for many activities. Very quiet at night. The operator Alexander is awesome, always helpful."

This is one of the nicest places we have stayed and loved being part of the community here. Our one night stay turned into three and we would definitely return. Also, we are a 9 meter motorhome and no problems."
99617,2498313,5,Bajonska,17/11/2022,"Absolutely lovely. A well run, lovingly landscaped little gem. I spent three nights here and loved every second. Pitches with power and water, a friendly owner and a beautiful spot. Lagos you is easily accessible for 16 Euro via taxi app. Thank you Alex"
99617,2490683,4,Lunatica66,11/11/2022,"Area poorly indicated by the application, pay attention to the road signs, a very new area with all the services as an objection that if you go with a motorhome like us of 7.5 it is complicated to maneuver. One night €13. Very quiet stay."
99617,2484213,5,CarolinHintz,05/11/2022,"A great pitch! Only €13 for a well laid out site, all with running water and electricity, full bathrooms, super pressure showers, double sinks, washing machines (€4).

99617,2448874,4,Smithjim,17/10/2022,"Nice clean new site that the owner is enlarging. Small plots but ok but won’t take anything over 8.5 mtr, also the approach road is a little narrow through the village. Sanitation block small and mixed with only one separate wc.

So far everything is good, but the reason for our visit was actually only the sanitary facilities. These were ugly. The toilet was completely crapped up to the ceiling and the shower wasn't exactly clean either... It's better to stand somewhere in the parking lot and go to the toilet in a café..."

Very well maintained and clean, but as some have written, there is hardly any shade because the trees are still quite small. The only disadvantage: only two showers (also in combination with a toilet), so that it builds up a bit in the morning. Otherwise a great place, can only be recommended! We paid €13 with electricity"

99617,1882864,4,Masmoudi,11/05/2022,A very neat place. The price/performance ratio is really cheap. It could get tight there for larger motorhomes. Maybe there will be an improvement with the space expansion that is currently being built. This means that construction noise cannot be ruled out during the day.
99617,1872167,5,b3rny,05/05/2022,"A quiet place, for 13 euros all inclusive. Common areas with barbecue and trampoline and castle for children. Two showers, toilets and sinks. Simple access. A very good option."

99617,1817308,4,klr40,12/04/2022,The most well-kept facility we have ever been to. The reception was very friendly and spoke good English. The WiFi works well on the pitches in front. The chickens are a nice extra. The reason why it's not 5 stars is because the pitches are pretty narrow or there should be more trees between them. Value for money is just right. We would come back.

99617,1788926,4,marieinspiringexplorers,20/03/2022,"A great spot to spend the night when visiting the coast as wild camping is very regulated, we found it was the best option close to Lagos and Portimao for this price. Alexandre is really nice and speaks French. The only nuisance we had was a dog belonging to another camper barking for a while in the evening, other than that it was perfect. There are warm showers and everything is really clean."
99617,1779991,1,STARMCLOUIS,11/03/2022,"Site badly located far from everything, very difficult access for motorhomes of 7m, no hot water in the showers, no lighting in the blocks to do the dishes do not recommend especially for the price and emptying platform very difficult to access"

As soon as it arrived, your dog attacked a peaceful animal and behaved very aggressively. The driveway could be mastered well by very large campers. Recommend: Go to campsites and not parking spaces in the future"
99617,1730117,5,Elise72000,08/01/2022,"Mr LUFIZER, we also did not appreciate that your dog, not on a leash as provided for in the area instructions, attacks other motorhome dogs and if you want more space, go to campsites where the price is not the same (I came with a 12 meters and I was delighted) Thank you again to the Staff for this excellent New Year's Eve! :)"
99617,1730071,5,nellie24430,08/01/2022,A small paradise for a family motorhome area where the owners speaking several languages are always available and ready to help you. We always come back with great pleasure.
99617,1726315,3,lufizer,04/01/2022,We can't understand the top rating. 3 stars for the extremely friendly groundskeeper. We didn't like the rest at all. Small pitches laid out in terraces. Larger mobiles from 9 mtrs must already circle here at the entrance. The lower area of the square smells extremely of canal. Not a nice environment. Fire brigade from the operator on New Year's Eve despite many dogs from guests on site

99617,1712349,3,PaulinaOnTour,19/12/2021,"Actually great parking space. Still new, probably still little shade in summer because the trees are still small. What was really annoying, however, was the barking of dogs and several roosters that thought they had to sound the alarm from 3:00 o'clock ... don't forget your ear plugs. 2 washing machines but unfortunately no dryer"
99617,1710135,5,trmbakker,14/12/2021,"In a word, SUPER, beautiful and very neat motorhome. Very friendly and helpful owners. Neat and spacious shower and toilet. Price of €13.00 is more than worth it for all inclusive. We would definitely come back again."

99617,1597598,2,BNCToni,21/09/2021,"Actually, this place deserves 5 stars. Then why do we only give 2? The site is on a slope and the parking spaces are terraced. There is a supply and disposal area in the middle of the building. From there, the gray water is directed to a fallow plot and disposed of on the surface. This leads to the fact that it stinks in the lower seats. Both are not possible!"
99617,1590766,5,guillemnieto,19/09/2021,Very good place. Both the plots and the facilities in optimal condition. The attentive reception and good location to visit the beaches around Portimao or Lagos. The only downside we found was the barking of a neighborhood dog.
99617,1582085,5,Rotolandoperilmondo,16/09/2021,Perfect camper stop! possibility to drain / load water and take a shower without spending the night. Water load shower 10 euros

99617,1504419,5,ThierryGRAFF,23/08/2021,"BADSEVE a place where you can take out table and chairs do you find that small? Nine times out of ten on the camping areas because you can do without the salt without opening the cell door, you are not in a campsite where the prices are very different. Your ours is unfair compared to other users of this area."

Price per month 300 € with all the services (16 amps which does not cut out, city water at constant pressure, impeccable upkeep of the premises and above all real and frank helpfulness). For me, given the atmosphere, it's the best place to confine yourself."

We first thought of staying for 1-2 nights maximum before heading to a motor home park closer to Tavira/Faro, but we ended up staying for 44(!!) days!Alexandre and Vivaldo are keeping this place nice and clean. The toilets and shower are super fresh and have hot showers. The sink for dishes is fresh and clean, the pitch is clean and spacious, we put out our motorbikes + siting area and still felt spacious. The site is situated in a small village with two small grocery shops, 2-3 cafes and really nice hikes/ morning walks around the place. To alvor beach it was 10min with motorbikes (beautiful beach!!!) and you can find bigger grocery stores around there. Everyone at the site are very friendly sly and helpful. This place has a relaxing and calm vibe and we loved it! Would come back in a heartbeat! Thank you for everything!!"

The travelers we met there are wonderful, we had a lovely week, and we will be back!"
99617,1119729,4,butfun,06/12/2020,Alex was a friendly host and is clearly keen to make this new site a success.  Pitches were spacious enough with water points scattered around the site.  The free toilet and showers were an added bonus.  Washing machine payable at €4.  Fresh bread daily available if you preorder.  Shame there’s no easy walkable or cycling route back into Alvor.  Can cater for all size vehicles but if you’re over 8mtr long I suggest you contact in advance.
99617,1119561,5,dan13ll3,05/12/2020,"Campsite fantastic, so friendly and feel so safe. However there is a problem with barking dogs outside the campsite which is sad. Cockerel is not as annoying but he wakes too early. Haha"
99617,1119202,5,dmpcamper,04/12/2020,"Great place with a great owner. Just wanted to stay one night and have been here for 2.5 weeks. It is particularly great that the visitors help each other a lot here (e.g. with technical issues on the cars) and Alexandre, the owner, has many good contacts to the surrounding services. You have to get along with the dogs and the rooster. We use oropaks."
99617,1118602,5,mariustourdumonde,30/11/2020,There were even the thierry swiss ... in any case a great area or even social distancing between motorhomes is respected. Too bad it is not forbidden to morons.
99617,1118597,5,ThierryGRAFF,30/11/2020,"To answer Jerry and Margo if we don't want a rooster or a dog, we don't come to Portugal and the pancake party organized by a French family and in which you did not want to participate (there was not only French but also English, Portuguese, German, Austrian and Swedish) was in the open air and the distance was respected."
99617,1118596,5,familybusroad,30/11/2020,Jerry and Margo from the English were also kindly invited to eat a pancake too but they refused .. No worries .. I think you should have confined yourself to the woods if you don't want anyone around you. It's a shame because the mentality of motorhome operators is not exactly like that.
99617,1118595,5,familybusroad,30/11/2020,"To respond to jerry and Margo's comment. We celebrated the birthdays of 3 children from different families. Each person in the camper van area was invited to eat a pancake standing outside, keeping a distance. Because we have a logical conscience towards the owner and everyone."
99617,1118524,2,JerryandMargo,30/11/2020,Nice sized plots with services. Downside is a noisy builders yard behind with much daytime activity from early doors. Barking dogs & a 5 am cockerel wake up call. The majority of French here have seemingly been lucky enough to be covid vaccinated looking at tonight’s antics. 22 attending a pan cake party in very close proximity. Including the 2 owners. Hence we’re out of here tomorrow

The access may be surprising but if you do not enter by the 1st street going up into the village, by taking the next exit on the same roundabout, you can then reach the area without a right angle turn. Look at Google earth to fully understand."

Each plot also has to connect the light. It has no bathrooms yet but we went to another one with bathrooms and we didn't like anything, so we went back to spend a second night in this place. The door is usually closed, which is great for going with children or your pet. There is a telephone to call. Both nights we slept great."
