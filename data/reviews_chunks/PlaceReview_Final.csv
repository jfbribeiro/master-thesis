393519,2558919,3,IvanilTerribile,23/01/2023,"I was in this Disa Propane center the first week of January and I had 2 Italian gas cylinders. 1 they filled it for me and the second one they collected and disposed of, they told me that they filled all types of cylinders, the important thing is that they have not expired as a test. I have no interest in telling lies."
393519,2558770,1,Nikoliane,23/01/2023,"They only load Spanish cylinders, moreover if you want to buy one of theirs you have to make a contract and have a residence on the island … nice rip off"
393527,2549561,5,freeandeasyventures,11/01/2023,Huge washing machine in the center of ubeda. Good results and really close to the center with various shops
393556,2685799,4,rosaamarilla,21/04/2023,"We have parked in another very large field of dirt behind the caprabo, next to the central street... I don't know how to put it and that's why I say it on this site. It was the feast of Saint Christ... a blast of activities, concerts, etc. and the super quiet countryside...perfect."
393560,3032932,1,deMan71,28/07/2023,"within 10 minutes of parking, window broken and broken into."
393573,2767785,5,irewondo,20/05/2023,"It is very quiet, we stayed one night and we did not see a single person. in the middle of the very beautiful mountain"
393587,3286818,4,MarcelSmeets,11/09/2023,great place mirador with beautiful view very quiet no services. had a quiet night here
393603,3228196,4,BazzFamily,27/08/2023,accessible by heavy-weight 19t we spent a few days at la guardia no problem and in high season access 5 min to the crystal clear water beach on the other hand from day and night passage by car
393603,3033184,3,optrot,28/07/2023,"nice view, nice walks to the military domain. The beach is a 5 min walk away, with 2 restaurants, nice and friendly. Had a quiet night."
393603,2606556,3,Maetthy,12/03/2023,"The driveway is very narrow for the last few hundred meters to the square. Not recommended with large motorhomes over 7 meters. Despite a cul-de-sac to the restaurant and beach, there is some traffic at night. If you sleep well, you won't have any problems. The panorama with sunset is super nice."
393611,2560099,3,jette87,25/01/2023,"Large area, not quite straight and next to the road but ok for one night"
393614,2579635,1,Provon,16/02/2023,"NO GO!!! Super bad place, nothing gat clean and it was super expensive!!!"
393614,2558975,2,0range,23/01/2023,"despite washing program 2/hot water 45°, the washing water remains cold"
393661,2596631,1,mikelbv,03/03/2023,"It is full of caravans parked with no people inside. Parking lots on a road where cars do not stop passing at high speed, day and night. You can't rest, you move up to the motorhome at the speed at which they pass. I do not recommend it."
393695,3290196,5,acinipo-,12/09/2023,"I loved this place. I came for 2 days and I stayed for 5. The services always smell like glory. There is exquisite cleanliness and the treatment couldn't be better. Two wonderful people and everything you need in the town is still happening and the beach is relatively quiet. In short, I recommend it, I will return, and the rate now is €12."
393695,3254498,5,arantzi73,03/09/2023,Perfect place to sleep and to visit Chipiona
393695,3250425,4,Maribelcl,02/09/2023,"Good area to visit Chipiona and surroundings. At first you couldn't camp because they had another type of license, but it is now allowed, the only thing they don't let you do is have a barbecue and put a tarp on the ground to protect the grass. The only drawback I have is that it still doesn't have sinks and since there are only two of us traveling, we don't pay that extra. At 300 m. There is a local grill and fryer to pick up food."
393695,3209953,5,Dxt,24/08/2023,"Place near the center, 15 minutes walk, the beach in a super close line, the quiet and very cozy place, hot showers and bathrooms. The charming owner will certainly repeat soon, thank you very much for everything, we slept wonderfully"
393695,3194909,4,carlosutrera,21/08/2023,"Careful, clean, collected and guarded. The only problem I see is that it is far from practically everything. The beach takes about 10 minutes walking and is crowded. If you want to get to the downtown area, it takes about 30 or 40 minutes on foot. Nearby, you only have small neighborhood stores. And the owners run it wonderfully, but the only drawback is that, the place where it is located."
393695,3182075,1,francisco46Badajoz,19/08/2023,"!!! BEWARE! They do not admit unapproved campers but they do not notify it by phone, nor do they have it in writing, in theory it is Parking because they do not allow seats to be taken out according to their rules but then they do turn a blind eye. Well... when it comes to the approvals they also pass the hand to whomever they think since three days before some friends had spent the night there and they didn't ask them for anything... weird, weird."
393695,3176140,4,Semarri42,18/08/2023,"Very comfortable place with large plots and the staff is friendly, the door is always closed even though the reception is open. Everything is quite new and things have to be improved. When there are many campers, there is no light for all of them, which is inconvenient and that is why I do not give 5 stars. This I suppose will improve over time."
393695,3128039,1,Bruneteaufredo,12/08/2023,We arrived at 2 p.m. on August 9 No one present on site only reachable by phone When I called I was told that everything was full and we saw that there were more than 10 free pitches hard to believe ..... The person sent me an SMS following our call telling me that everything was booked still hard to believe....
393695,3121997,4,Canarias_Viaja,11/08/2023,"A very quiet and clean place, very well attended. €18 per day with electricity, services and hot shower. Possibility of washing machine. Very close to the center and the beach. We have been several days."
393695,3109116,1,Sara19802015,09/08/2023,We called to make a reservation..we arrived and they told us that we couldn't if the furniture is not approved in the papers.. we brought a mini Camper.. he left us out so be careful they only want Campers with a high purchasing power or motorhomes. nothing recommended better not go
393695,3097007,3,vivicampers,07/08/2023,"A quiet place, to visit Chipiona 5 minutes from the beach and 20 minutes walking to the center, 15 euros a night for a t4 two people, clean bathrooms and showers, we will repeat"
393695,3091566,5,marisa22,06/08/2023,"Magnificent area, both the owners and the worker are charming, we came for a few days and we have been here for almost two weeks and we continue to enjoy Chipiona and its people here."
393695,3084363,5,karineroule,05/08/2023,"Superb secure area. Clean toilets, caring managers despite the language barrier. Nice discovery for this small town I highly recommend."
393695,3067083,5,EliasRiquelme,03/08/2023,"Excellent site. very cosy. It has many sites, at the moment little shade but in a few years the best area for sure. 2 bathrooms with 2 showers each one unloading the toilet, a sink is needed. Excellent treatment, quiet and very clean. highly recommended."
393695,3041562,1,nereau,29/07/2023,"Although everything is fine, the price for a family of four is outrageous, it's laughing at one"
393695,3008295,3,jrfernandez,23/07/2023,"300m from the beach, one km from the center, although bars and atmosphere very close. Everything clean but only dis showers with little or no privacy, they don't have WiFi, if you want electricity you have to wait for others to leave. They don't let you put canvas on the ground so that the green comes out when it's a real dusty terrarium. Upon entering they give you paper indicating not to take anything as they are considered camping"
393695,3007194,5,IvanGallardo,23/07/2023,"It is located in a very good area, a quiet place without noise, clean and tidy, no mosquitoes, we were 2 people one night (€15), friendly staff. In the future it will be a great area if they continue like this. Beach and beach bars nearby, we'll be back!"
393695,2996704,5,novemberlilli,21/07/2023,"We (2 p.) paid €15/24h for our camper. Showers, toilets and washing machine (4€ per load) available. Place very well maintained! Friendly, helpful staff. We had no problem with mosquitoes. Didn't hear a rooster in 3 nights, and the barking of dogs was absolutely limited. Small trash can in the square, large one around the corner on the street. Awning etc. allowed!"
393695,2994983,1,freyasgard88,21/07/2023,€15 a night… but if we go with my two daughters €15 of supplement!!! I don't understand…..
393695,2981403,5,Jefekiki,18/07/2023,"Very good and very clean area close to everything, friendly owners and quiet nights, it is true that you can hear some barking and some rooster, but you are in the countryside, we want to be in the middle of nature and not hear anything, I say it for the comments that I have read, I recommend it without a doubt, I do not know what world some live in."
393695,2973293,5,VivaLaVidaEmAutocaravana,16/07/2023,"We really liked the park, super quiet, clean, people are very friendly. the changing rooms are clean, there is a washing machine and electricity. We were only going to stay one night and stayed two nights."
393695,2965900,4,myfriendstan1,15/07/2023,"We had a good night here, everything that you need with friendly owners. Short walk into town."
393695,2961695,4,marlaaa,14/07/2023,"In itself a great pitch with everything you need, but we had the worst night of our holiday here as we were completely stabbed, 1000 dogs barked and just before five the neighborhood roosters gave a concert."
393695,2943641,5,JMRIKO,09/07/2023,"Spectacular area, shops and bars nearby, everything very clean and nice owners where there are. They take care of their clients as if they had known you all your life, and they take care that the environment is the most pleasant. The location of 10. Recommended 100x100"
393695,2943495,4,jgon46,09/07/2023,"Super well located area. The charming owners. they enforce quiet hours. That there are also people who want to rest, even if they leave with children. Highly recommended."
393695,2943420,5,Josecarpeto,09/07/2023,"Area of 10! Good area, very close to the beach and 10 min walk from the center, lots of shops and bars around. Super clean bathrooms, coinless shower. Nice owners and they go out of their way to make you comfortable. Guaranteed rest, the owners make sure that the hours of silence are respected. 100% recommendable."
393695,2938636,5,oscar106,08/07/2023,"Well located, near the beach and surrounded by bars. This place is not shaded (young trees). There is not always possibility of electricity. Quiet residential area without noise. Of the three men's services, only 1 with a lid to sit on, the same as the women's. The price for two people is adequate. They do not allow barbecues. Too bad they don't allow you to add photos. We will be back."
393695,2937792,5,gedlam,08/07/2023,"We went for 1 night and stayed 3 days. Lovely place, everything very clean and well maintained. They take great care to make you feel comfortable. They are a lovely couple, super friendly and helpful. If we go down to Chipiona again, we will definitely come back here."
393695,2930195,4,Abrah,06/07/2023,"Area very close to the beach and 30 minutes walk from the center of Chipiona. Bathrooms with showers, correct, correct water change. The only drawback is little shade, for the moment, they are working on it and the price for a family of 4 like us is 30 euros. For the rest a 10. We will return"
393695,2911627,4,dnk3,01/07/2023,"Correct area, €15 a night for two people, all included, in Chiclana itself, very quiet, beach nearby."
393695,2909031,5,adventurero,30/06/2023,"I can say that I have spent some great days in this area of La Laguna. Clean, accessible, affordable and well located for the beach and relaxation. Highly recommended. The management a 10. I will return for sure. See you soon Felix and family."
393695,2899356,5,JoseFence,27/06/2023,"We were going for 2 days and we stayed 4, Felix the owner was super helpful, the toilets and other services were very well cared for, it is close to the beach and the city (a great location). We recommend it."
393695,2892535,5,AnaViesca,25/06/2023,"The site is very good. 15 euros a night for a van without electricity. 10 minutes walk from the beach and 20 from the center. very quiet and flat, toilets and showers are very clean."
393695,2890866,4,trnquilo,25/06/2023,"Good afternoon, I'm in the area and I personally don't think it's expensive. The services are fine for me. The only drawback is that they don't have sinks and one thing that is not their responsibility, but the Chipiona town hall, which, like all town halls, only thinks about collecting the showers on the Camaron beach, four stars are still not working because of the sinks. I reiterate"
393695,2889506,1,MiriamR.,25/06/2023,"seems very expensive!! You pay per person, since when in an area where you pay per person?"
393695,2883195,4,ASD2021,23/06/2023,"Very quiet area, wide pitches, good services, very friendly staff. Beach 200 m. Town center 20 minutes walk. Little shade for now as the trees are young."
393695,2870691,5,Soniamarbella,19/06/2023,"Very quiet area, spacious plots, very clean bathrooms, 5 minutes from a beautiful beach and the town very close, very good service at reception, we will be back"
393695,2870026,5,jur,19/06/2023,Super quiet area with all services. Both Ana and Félix and her niece are available to help you with whatever you need. The beach 500 meters away and the nerve center of Chipiona a 20-minute walk away. For us who like tranquility we will repeat for sure.
393695,2845305,1,corbacho1314,12/06/2023,"Very expensive for us who go with children and do not use showers other than the one in the car, it seems amazing to me, luck."
393695,2835012,2,Capitano1,09/06/2023,"Since it is only a parking lot, setting up chairs, tables and awning is forbidden, the place for 15€ per night without electricity is too expensive! The driveway is a bit adventurous, the plots rather unkempt. There are no rubbish bins on the entire square or in front of it."
393695,2831306,1,xuanga,08/06/2023,"In the end we are promoting these areas (camping) that end up being campsites, bathrooms, showers, etc. schedules and payment per person etc. like a campsite, when we only need to load and unload, to pay for these services, nothing else is needed, the campsites are there for the rest"
393695,2808292,5,Sorginbidaiaria,01/06/2023,"We spent a night there, new area very close to the beach, large plots, very clean, the town surprised us a lot, everything is within walking distance. It is appreciated that we have new areas. If we return to Chipiona we will return without a doubt."
393695,2771283,5,gestionarce,21/05/2023,"Very pretty town, beautiful beaches, ideal for cycling, the perfect place I wish they were all like that"
393695,2766522,5,Lapiki,20/05/2023,"I am spending this weekend in this place that, reading a previous comment, it seems that we are in another place! Quiet place, large plots, close to the sea and the town, super clean toilets... Oh, and it seems very logical to me that you pay per person, we all make use of the services offered. I hope it doesn't change. Luck!!"
393695,2754435,5,toparvaz,16/05/2023,"Perfect place to rest, bathe in the nearby beach, buy or have a drink in the many restaurants, ice cream parlors and shops on the avenue. a pleasant 2 kilometer walk to the center. The staff is very attentive, they help you or advise you. A 10 for them. The spacious plots although of land. The bathrooms are very very clean at all times."
393695,2737904,1,fabianmuniz,09/05/2023,"I am traveling with the family and I come from Puerto de Santa Maria. I have paid 28 euros for 4 people in a campsite, and here they ask me 30. They have never asked me for so much money in a motorhome area. Not even for Europe have I paid so much in August"
393695,2734143,5,ibainunez,08/05/2023,A deal of 10! and very new facilities and in perfect condition! We will repeat without a doubt
393695,2715301,5,Elliot.MAA,02/05/2023,"We have been this weekend and very well. It is a safe motorhome area, close to the beach, shops, bars and the town center. The workers are very friendly and regarding the price, my humble opinion, everyone at home does what they want. I have paid for it and would do it again if I wanted to spend a few days in that area."
393695,2704564,1,javier_svq,28/04/2023,"A pity that they are taken advantage of and abused, the one that is paid for children, I have not seen it in any motorhome area. Not even in Switzerland have I paid so dearly for 4 people"
393695,2674277,1,mclouis879,16/04/2023,camping prices I think they are wrong! I park in the one at the cheapest port and not so many drawbacks that if we go 2 than if we go 3 and so the price goes up we go 4 and the water lasts 3 or 4 days we shower and do everything in the car that matters to them that we are 2 like 4 I will never understand a crossed out place to go
393695,2664331,1,Jaime1984,12/04/2023,I wanted to book for the weekend in April. They ask me 30 euros per day. 2 adults and 2 children. Is the price of a campsite what they think they offer?
393695,2659019,3,mundutxikiak,10/04/2023,"Area with almost all the services, it does not have a place to clean the dishes etc. A bit chaotic in high season, they do not make reservations, nor do they keep track of how many places are occupied. It only has 2 stalls for electricity, so when we arrived we couldn't hire it because the area was full."
393695,2658271,3,quepereza,10/04/2023,"the beach is not close the town center is not close, at twelve you have to leave the plot the high season says it starts in April with those prices with four better a campsite"
393695,2653961,4,Abasnu,09/04/2023,"The area is very good, a quiet, clean, well-kept place, close to supermarkets, the beach, the city center, etc... They are just starting out and you can tell they want to do it right, they accept all kinds of advice, there is a sink for the dishes, to put a but The only thing is that I see that prices are going up for days and I don't really understand why..."
393695,2640804,4,Elmanolo,05/04/2023,"Quiet area with little noise. The owners are aware that the rules are followed (which seems good to me). Tables and chairs can be removed. Beach 4 minutes walk. Ideal to use the bike. Clean facilities. Only drawback, plots a little fair. Price from April 1 15 euros plus 5 days light"
393695,2640029,5,donnadieudany,04/04/2023,Close to the city centre. Very good welcome from the young owners. Very clean with large pitches
393695,2639301,5,Flipeando,04/04/2023,"I have spent 4 nights in this place, it is very beautiful, well maintained, the facilities are super clean. The plots are spacious, with grass, some have a light point, there is a water hose that reaches practically all the plots in case you do not want to move the car. It is very quiet. The beach is 500 meters away, the walk is pleasant. Bike lane, bus, bars, shops, I will definitely return."
393695,2639092,4,daniela2022,04/04/2023,"Very good place to visit Chipiona, very friendly and helpful owners, I can't give it 5 stars because you can't dry your hair, the automatic switch only has access to 1200w, electricity is €4 expensive for the watts they offer, they have to improve this point ."
393695,2638830,5,robandasa,04/04/2023,"If you're thinking of staying here, do it. Aside from Chipiona being a lovely local town, the owners of this site are the most helpful and friendly, very clean facilities, nice plot size. We stayed for 22 nights due to our dog being injured, and were glad we found this place to stay. They even offered us extra nights for free, but due to moving on we declined the offer. Thank you guys."

393695,2626812,5,mmanu28,27/03/2023,"Area with all the filling, emptying of gray and black services included at a good price. Also the showers are included in the €10. Very attentive staff, clean area, we spent 2 very quiet nights. A spectacular beach 5 minutes walk, bike lane next door and a greenway begins very close to walk or bike ride."
393695,2624955,5,MariayHeydar,26/03/2023,Brilliant. A 10 to spend a couple of days. All services and very friendly staff. Very affordable prices. Ideal.
393695,2621413,5,cled,23/03/2023,The owners are very personable and helpful. The place is well furnished and very clean and quiet. The pitches are generously dimensioned. We'd love to come back.

393695,2616701,5,Birgit1403,20/03/2023,"Quiet, well-kept complex on the outskirts, only about 500 meters from the beautiful beach. The parking spaces are spacious, toilets and showers very clean, supply and disposal easily accessible. Good starting point for bike tours and hikes. We just wanted to stay one night to rest... it turned into 3 ;)"

393695,2612440,1,Dr.DieterKlein,17/03/2023,Supply and final disposal is no longer possible.
393695,2612273,5,lorenaeloy,17/03/2023,"a 10 all new next to the sea and shops, spacious squares. thanks we will be back"
393695,2607350,5,isaterr,12/03/2023,"I give the area a 10. The owners are super friendly, the plots are flat, with grass, well defined and spacious. It has all the services and is very quiet. The beach is beautiful and is a 5-minute walk away and the town is 10 minutes away with a very nice walk. We will be back!"
393695,2607302,5,LaPirulicamper,12/03/2023,"Good place to escape, nice owners, a place that despite being close to everything is super quiet, the facilities are very well maintained. We will definitely return."
393695,2602923,5,euvalenzuela,08/03/2023,"We have been there for 9 days and everything was perfect, close to the beaches and the center, spacious plots and the couple who run it are always attentive to what you need, we will certainly return"
393695,2600327,5,ArturoArmario,06/03/2023,"A very quiet and well located area, 5 minutes from the beach and a short walk from the city center. Good electricity services, water, showers,... very clean, cared for and tastefully decorated. We liked it because the plots are delimited and it has space to set up a table and chairs and enjoy the good weather. The owners were very attentive to everything and very friendly. We are sure that we will repeat"
393695,2596705,4,setraschwarz,03/03/2023,"A real asset to Chipiona, clean space with big enough pitches. Central, quiet and clean. The place is worth its price. Un verdadero activo para Chipiona, espacio limpio con lanzamientos lo suficientemente grandes. Centrico, tranquilo y limpio. El lugar vale su precio."
393695,2596101,4,Palmeras,02/03/2023,"Spectacular parking, location very close to the beach and 10 minutes from downtown. Spacious and very quiet plots ideal for resting and disconnecting. Clean bathrooms and very friendly staff. To improve the issue of hot water, there is a lack of sink, washing kitchen utensils and electricity failure because the fridge does not work, being the failure of the electrical installation, not of the motorhome (verified in another area)."
393695,2595945,5,Reisefreak,02/03/2023,"Contrary to the claims of ""Femecamp"" there is indeed an official permit and the German-speaking employee is still employed there, only ill at the moment. Otherwise the place is very good, as often described, with committed operators who help wherever possible.

The employee who speaks German was taken advantage of by the couple and no longer works there. There is no permit! The electricity doesn't always work and the toilets are dirty. Be careful, they run the business illegally and take advantage of the employees!!"

393810,2696398,3,Hoopono,25/04/2023,"The machines wash very cleanly and quickly. However, I don't know why I have to pay a 25% surcharge as a penalty as a cash payer. The block was just populated with 2 inch cockroaches. Personally, I don't have a problem with that, and it doesn't really matter when it comes to washing."

393831,3202788,3,Anrhick,23/08/2023,"Very spacious place to leave the vehicle before going on the excursion. The bathrooms, water points and picnic tables are appreciated. Be careful if you go in the hottest months because there is nowhere to park in the shade."

Very quiet parking lot with no lights, but not disturbing, there is enough light from the street so that it is not in the dark. Nice starting point for hikes. Very good cell phone reception. Please to all who use the space, this is just a parking lot. Please no camping chairs, clothes dryers and other camping behavior. It would be a shame if this parking lot was closed to RVs."
393831,2651752,5,CLAUDIOCORTO,08/04/2023,We had a very good night. it is also a starting point for a beautiful hike without forgetting the very pleasant little town
393831,2645114,5,hakkieprakkie,06/04/2023,"Spent 1 night here. Quiet, great to have the public toilet around. Beautiful to start sunset/sunrise hike to castle. Indeed no sign that camping is forbidden."
393831,2642308,5,MartayEliseo,05/04/2023,"We spent 1 night here solely accompanied by an AC. Large dirt parking with bathroom and fountain. Next to a road with little traffic. It is the beginning of the route to Montgrí Castle. Very calm night, but at 8 o'clock cars began to arrive that came to do the route."
393831,2632823,5,joucali,01/04/2023,"We spent the night here and without a problem, we weren't the only ones, on top of that it has a sink and we went on a bike tour through the town and went down to the beach by the river in 20m with the bike"
393831,2584402,5,davidbiker,20/02/2023,We did not spend the night here but it seems an ideal place. Next to the town and just 50 meters from the path that goes up to Castell de Montgri (GR-92). It takes us about 40 minutes to go up to the castle. With children or people in poor shape it can take a little longer. There are other trails leaving from the same point (photo)
393840,2579734,3,crilerosi,16/02/2023,Difficult to find parking as there are a lot of locals but great water pressure
393849,2556184,3,Elvano,20/01/2023,Unfortunately the water pressure is very low. 25 liters took about 10 minutes.
393850,2633854,2,HeinMueckEU,01/04/2023,"Sure OK for a night in a pinch, but the noisy fast road, rail line, airport and location itself don't make this a favorite."
393900,2733035,3,RuthandKoen,08/05/2023,"Didn't sleep, but had breakfast. From here ideal for walking to Far de Cabajo, really beautiful. Sleeping will be noisy."
393900,2681717,2,gyzmo35,19/04/2023,"Good for visiting the pretty town out of season. The pitches are along the impasse, but this one is paved. Difficult to sleep at night with cars passing and returning, not to mention the constant hum of trawlers."
393900,2666008,3,LosMarin,13/04/2023,"It's fine when there are no cars, the motorhome is very much in the middle of the street and it's like a two-way street, beautiful views and walking along the bay."
393903,2595822,5,carthagotur,02/03/2023,Super nice and quiet place. We spent a peaceful night there. Charming small village. No services except water fountain in the village.
393904,2591793,4,Vaneton,26/02/2023,"Area under construction but can already be used, slight slope, very quiet place without noise, somewhat narrow streets to get to if you come across another car in the opposite direction, but little traffic, services not yet determined, promising site, thanks to the authorities for these spaces."
393904,2587351,4,Cebrun,22/02/2023,"A nice, quiet place on the outskirts. The place looks friendly unspectacular. The surrounding area invites you to go hiking. So far there is no V/E on site, the current construction work could have that as a goal, at least there will be a water connection soon."
393931,2937594,5,sepzz,08/07/2023,Beautiful view! Location is accessible. Just follow the only road that isn't closed down and you get there.

393931,2555419,5,VaniUndFeli,19/01/2023,"Great place for a night or even more. We experienced a great sunset and sunrise and were able to start a hike directly from there, really great for anyone who is looking for some peace, solitude and nature between the cities. At night everything is quiet and dark, during the day some athletes come by. The parking space below looks good too. Have come up well with 7m."
393942,2676862,3,Wildapple,17/04/2023,"The water runs out very slowly. If you want to fill the mobile home, you should plan some time. Canister or watering can required."

393945,2724077,1,GlobeAdventure,05/05/2023,"If we hadn't arrived so late, we wouldn't have stayed. Dog barking is incessant. Awful night. It's unbearable. We do not recommend at all."
393945,2649124,4,alemolina,08/04/2023,"To spend one night it is correct. The road does not make unbearable noise, now, yes, the dogs from the neighboring farms are constantly barking (day and night). Another thing, if you plan to visit the town and you have to go on foot, it is not far but if you have to climb a hill, what a ""cost""!!!"
393956,2706461,1,lovaandersson,29/04/2023,There is a prohibited sign for motorhome.
393957,2869773,4,lasbamarie,19/06/2023,"Pleasant night in the shade, alone. A few teenagers who meet in the evening nothing bad. On the other hand very dirty , the garbage cans accumulate . Tables available"

393957,2625086,3,MoritzFiege,26/03/2023,"Quiet place. There is a grill hut. The trees make the place appear very dark. We drove on, but staying the night doesn't seem to be a problem."
393957,2609876,5,reezeyy,14/03/2023,"Nice place, despite its proximity to the town, it is very quiet at night. Benches everywhere, shade from the trees and a BBQ shelter. 

A few youths until 9pm, but no issues."
393959,2628897,5,lalaandjavi,29/03/2023,"Drinking water right next to the road. It has a small  hose attached to it, we attached our hose to the little one. There is enough soace to park the van while filling water tank. Great pressure. Some locals filling water bottles"
393977,2664539,3,TitiLeejoice,12/04/2023,"Service area not free for water but it goes with the races I had 2 tokens. On the other hand, the central drain grid is clogged and the slope is bad, the water drains towards the car park. If you have the hose you can drain at the foot of the filling valve"
393977,2626600,2,emelyberkes,27/03/2023,"To be honest, I think buying 20 euros or 4 euros for water is pretty cheeky. Apart from that, draining the gray water doesn't work properly (overflows) The purchase was completely overpriced and the water is chlorinated"

It has garbage cans... A very good option to sleep on the way to Madrid or Cuenca
393984,2610204,2,saintamour,15/03/2023,"A great spot, shade thanks to the trees 2 positive stars for that. The edges of the car park are a real dump, it's despicable to be so dirty. The faucet does not work. And the gps point via google maps took us to the city center, to a roundabout and nothing more. (use Waze) minus 3 stars for this"
393984,2553318,5,Lulivan,16/01/2023,Nice and quiet place. Good place to rest

393992,3177851,4,sarahantho,19/08/2023,Quiet and pleasant view of the canal. We spent one night there. The center of Aveiro is 4min by bike. Be vigilant about the tide do not park too close to the low wall. The low wall is not high to pay attention to children.
393992,2882880,3,alainbarrere,23/06/2023,"Place at the marina with disused buildings. Very large land site, flat. Close to the city. We spent a quiet night there, noise from a few cars but not disturbing. Good place to go if you don't know where to sleep"
393996,3249661,5,road03,02/09/2023,Very good for parking for a day trip in Seville. Haven't stayed overnight but seems safe. 7€ for 24 hours if you ask the guard.
393996,2782719,5,dpluss,24/05/2023,Ideal parking for visiting Seville. I recommend..
393996,2748945,4,nuestrajurgo20,14/05/2023,"We spent one night there. good location, pharmacies nearby, supermarket 5' and the center is Seville 15'. We talked to the guy at the reception and he gave us the €7 24h pass. The toilets were closed on Sunday. There are bins but they are small, and at night there is a little noise from cars, ambulances, kids in the park next door (we stayed on a Saturday) but otherwise, very good."
393996,2719694,5,Gui.and.Barbie,03/05/2023,Very convenient for visiting the city. In the center. We spent the night there. Recent clean and guarded parking. €17.5 for 24 hours. Attention limited to 2.3 m. We passed with our van Adria 6m. Vtaiment ideal for crisscrossing Seville. Ask the guard before entering a 24 hour pass and it will only cost you 7€.
393996,2695890,4,hcarpio13,25/04/2023,"Perfect parking lot for sleeping. Very close to the center. There are two types of fee. Rate A charges you for normal parking up to €16.50 per day. The B if you are going to spend the night costs you 7 euros all day. To be able to take the B rate, you must request it from the entrance worker, if there is one, before entering the car park. We did not read it well and they charged us 17.50 for 24 hours."
393996,2669021,5,RitxiAzzena,14/04/2023,Deluxe. You have to ask for the bonk before entering the parking lot so that your stay is much cheaper. We slept very well and the bathrooms are in fair condition.
393996,2645246,5,idodavid,07/04/2023,We have spent two nights without problem and quiet. 15 min walk to the cathedral. It has bathrooms (although quite dirty). €16.5 per day.

394007,3068709,3,Manonpaillette,03/08/2023,Very nice location with a view and calm. Presence of tables and trash cans and even a swing. We had a visit from the fox all evening. Only big downside there is a lot of wind but good logic in an area surrounded by mills and wind turbines. Lots of toilet paper. Pick up your papers!!!
394007,3056257,4,T4P2,01/08/2023,"Very quiet and nice views, but it is very windy."
394007,2822123,5,katandgoretti,05/06/2023,"Stunning spot with 360 degree views. The last 200m is an easy gravel road that is not too steep. Many daytime visitors coming to see the ruins but we were the only ones overnight. Very quiet, no traffic noise, no airplanes, no dogs barking! Sunset, full moon rising and sunrise. Loved it."
394007,2599356,5,theauroravan,05/03/2023,"Great spot with a view. In the evening some folks come up to watch the sunset. There is a swing behind the hill. Also there is an antenna right next to it, so if you are sensitive to such things, be warned. Quiet at night even on the weekend."

394025,2750731,1,OakeyBoi,15/05/2023,We arrived to find the site has closed and is now a water sports centre.
394025,2689244,3,sisilapomme,22/04/2023,Difficult arrival at the Waze village misled us. We were looking for the campsite. Help brought by a resident who drove us there but the campsite was closed. We spent the night next to the entrance to the lake. No service. The next morning the manager of the campsite refused access to the emptying places even for a fee. Not nice . The area was very good apart from this inconvenience.
394025,2639405,3,Barnie2007,04/04/2023,"Actually a nice campsite on a great lake with a view of the mountains, but unfortunately we had to clean the beach of garbage and broken glass before swimming. The approach through the village is very narrow"
394025,2638970,5,naluc,04/04/2023,"TOP! on the edge of the lake, magnificent view, warm welcome, very clean sanitary facilities, on lawn with shade. for access, go through the industrial area after the Repsol gas station, towards Villamartin: dirt road, accessible with a 12-meter trailer. The city center is to be avoided at all costs because small narrow streets and full of one-way streets"
394025,2629318,5,Alexiskvk,29/03/2023,"great place, quiet. there is everything you need and the price is right. 20€ for two people with a campervan."
394025,2577112,2,hellebia,13/02/2023,"Opened normally. You pay 6€ per person and 8€ for a camper. We (2 people) paid €20 for one night. No hot water, noisy neighbors, sanitary facilities didn't smell good and the access through the village is quite narrow! We're not coming anymore."

394025,2567383,4,Vikingson,03/02/2023,"The location is worth five stars. Access is not necessarily comfortable via a dirt road. The GPS position given by Google is 36.8100 and -5.7399. The asking price is 6€ per person and 8€ for the vehicle without services. In fact, nothing is displayed. CAT stands for Tourist Activities Centre."

In spring my nose is 100% stuck here but the yellow flowers look great! A little garbage is lying around, but that didn't bother us."

394056,2796905,3,DCLJ,28/05/2023,All other spots were full around the city when we arrived at noon. This was a reasonable alternative. Very close to the city center. Payed 7€ for 4 hours.
394056,2754402,4,TheaDriessen,16/05/2023,Spacious and reasonably priced. Paid around €8 for 4 hours and could use toilets at train station.

Next to the road but only a few cars a day. We saw only one other van in the few days we stayed in May."
394062,2560607,3,stiltkin,26/01/2023,"We spent a night here, very quiet at night, except for a little noise from cars going to refuel. The shower costs €3, it is a small bathroom where the drain gets clogged, but they are clean and have hot water. The employee is very nice."
394062,2553944,5,ochopatas,17/01/2023,"Although it is next to the highway, there is not much noise since the area is behind the gas station. Clean showers and very hot water. The employee who served us was very friendly."

394065,2783564,3,Wallies82,25/05/2023,"Unfortunately we had some bad luck. First we sent the navigation system via the iPhone into the narrow streets of the city and thought this would be the place. Then at 7 a.m. many construction vehicles parked a few meters away and many loud pedestrians talked next to the vehicles. The view was great in the evening, but unfortunately it was quite noisy here overall."

394065,2680266,4,uwegarbers,18/04/2023,Here you can spend the night quite quietly. The nice town of Agamonte and its small harbor are within walking distance. The sunset is gigantic.
394065,2638175,5,aanaa_1992,03/04/2023,"A peaceful place. In the afternoon there are a lot of people walking around. I recommend the walk in the direction of Ayamonte, it is very beautiful. Better take into account the streetlights, we slept under one, so many mosquitoes arrived."

394101,2579876,4,ginette-royer,16/02/2023,parking very well facing the beach at the sea and very quiet restaurants very pleasant
394101,2573985,3,Basoline,10/02/2023,"Plenty of room. Big. Subsoil partly solid gravel and sand and bumpy. Due to strong wind in combination with high tide, parts of the car park are now under water. Reed along the back provides partial shelter. Restaurants directly opposite the parking lot. Please respect their facilities and at least have a drink. After all, you have your own sanitary facilities with you. Road along parking not busy. Environment boring."
394101,2565344,3,IluminaRopa,31/01/2023,Was too crowded and uncomfortable for us. When we arrived the police were just pointing out no camping behavior. We're moving on.
394101,2556280,1,beate11,20/01/2023,"A large part of the site is under water. Unfortunately, we found that some people emptied their cassettes in the reeds when it was dark. It would also be nice if campers not only used the toilets at Bar Hoyo19, but also spent money here would."
394101,2555456,5,garneleauftour,19/01/2023,Very nice place right on the beach. Very many campers but totally quiet and well maintained.
394120,3287770,5,ShadowST,12/09/2023,"We had a great night there, calm and cool. Be careful, the path is really hard! Ok small van, impossible camper van or large van. We met local people who didn't say anything"
394120,3255901,4,lunezi,04/09/2023,"Beautiful spot, tricky to reach but the unique feeling you get it worth the effort. Only 1 spot with a view, unless you don’t have a 4x4 or want to risk to get stuck. Shore covered with algae…"
394120,3206298,5,otks31,23/08/2023,Very hard to find but it's worth the detour to the water filled with algae unfortunately but beautiful place
394120,3184335,4,Sarikitraun,19/08/2023,"Spectacular place, but BEWARE! You have to be from Bilbao to go down to the beach. To get out of there I saw them and I wished them for a final ramp that there is sand. With Camper, with 4x4 I suppose without problems. See published photo of the ramp ?"
394120,3181046,4,lauraundtim,19/08/2023,"Totally beautiful place, access is very difficult... you can only turn back at the end. Don't drive all the way to the beach! The road is very broken - we slept in the car park above and had a comfortable night. No services - in the morning an empty beach. Other campers were also there."
394120,3169837,5,MonaandLena,17/08/2023,"Beautiful place! You can't quite get to the beach because the path is very broken. Nevertheless, the square in front of it is quiet, clean and you have a fantastic view. We would come again!"

394120,2817036,4,Sarah-Fabi,03/06/2023,We drove to just before the beach (VW California). We didn't dare the last stretch without a 4x4. Very nice view to the sea. Quiet location and a couple of nice people.
394120,2784203,5,SomOutdoors,25/05/2023,"Beach with several parking lots, on the sand only suitable for 4x4. Unsupervised beach so you can go with dogs. Crowded during the day, at least on these dates. The access road is narrow and can be difficult for vehicles over 6 meters long."
394120,2681137,5,Pascal1969,19/04/2023,Super quiet place and laughed from the wind.
394120,2637800,4,Jaime1977madrid,03/04/2023,Really nice place with 4x4. Clean and beautifull.
394120,2617759,5,cherique,20/03/2023,"We were here around New Years. It's a fantastic place, but really only accessible by 4x4. As stated in the description. Because otherwise the road is indeed 'impassable'… ;-)"
394120,2617606,1,karinbartels,20/03/2023,"The road has become impassable this winter, only accessible by 4x4. It was a disaster for our camper van, don't try!"
394120,2555595,5,GIGIUDEFENDER,19/01/2023,"Beautiful, it's worth it"
394121,3264780,4,lubrllt,06/09/2023,"We were unable to access the indicated location, too much sand. But you can park a little before or explore. Very quiet to sleep! A few mosquitoes but very nice spot"

394121,3103918,1,MERCHATA,08/08/2023,"Crowded place, even if you arrive early you will end up having a thousand neighbors, if you are looking for privacy and tranquility, depending on the time of year, this is not the ideal place."
394121,3006459,3,Loandkik,23/07/2023,It is no longer accessible…path too damaged….You have to stop earlier (oyster farmer car park) but lots of people… Be careful not to go too far at the risk of getting stuck in the sand: we helped a bogged down van. Otherwise at the foot of the lagoon…with the railway line and luxury villas in the background. Please leave the premises clean and keep your waste (toilet paper) with you.
394121,2952803,5,hxavwen,12/07/2023,"Beautiful place. 5 min walk to the beach if you drive all the way behind. We didn't stop earlier, but it would have been possible. The sandy hill was actually no problem for our van, even without a 4x4."
394121,2946407,5,L4urett4,10/07/2023,"A very nice, quiet place, which is reached after a not so easy journey. But this is also possible with 6M. Follow the path up to the right at the small sand hill and then further places open up. Direct access to the beach and sea."
394121,2945211,4,Lprs,10/07/2023,Very quiet and suggestive place for the night. It is not easy to find the way to get to the end of the marked point. You have to take a small road on the right and make a narrow and sandy internal path in the last stretch. One of the locals told us that you can't stay overnight but there is no prohibition sign and it seemed to us rather an excuse for not having campers in the area
394121,2914623,5,cynthitita,02/07/2023,"We stayed two nights in the area, we had a luxurious time, the first day the police visited us but they didn't say anything, it would be a regular round. There is a cat that we fed a couple of nights, I was sorry to leave her there, I would appreciate it if the campers would think of the animals and leave them some food, so they survive, thank you!"
394121,2903815,4,AR158,29/06/2023,"Beautiful place right on a ""lake"" which branches off from the sea. On the way (which is partly sandy) you have several options to stop. When we arrived there were already three campers on site. (Just after the sandy part of the trail) Perfect for 4 smaller vans. The walk to the sea took about 15 minutes from there, but there was a little crowded beach in front. 1 star deduction because of mosquitoes."
394121,2877328,5,HelblingReisen,21/06/2023,"Wonderful place to stay! We were there two nights. Access with large vehicles is a bit tedious because of the partially sandy route, but doable. We got through well with a length of 6m and without a 4x4. There were always friendly walkers with dogs who greeted us warmly."
394121,2849666,5,fluxkiks,13/06/2023,"We stopped a little before, there are several places where you can park. It's a great spot! Quiet and very beautiful. We had a good night. We heard oyster farms working at night but it wasn't too disturbing. In the morning a cat visited us!"
394121,2829813,5,FordE350Euro,07/06/2023,This was an epic place to pass a night and if we would have had the time we would have stayed longer. We were all alone surrounded by nature and with a full moon. The vieuws in the morning from our bed were breathtaking. It wasn't the easiest spot to get but it's worth the hassle. Take right before the sand hill and watch Google maps satellite! Go for it and don't stop or the sand will eat you!
394121,2782610,4,Elli1805,24/05/2023,"First of all, we were unfortunately here in the rain. The journey was over a long gravel road. At the end the trail is very sandy so not fun when it rains. We still spent one night here with two other campers. The sleeping place is very secluded and quiet. So you can do well."
394121,2745978,5,mariedelecluse,13/05/2023,"Very nice spot for the night. The view is great and very peaceful. We weren't quite alone. Google maps direction is ok, we stopped earlier because there is a lot of sand on the way to get to the indicated spot, we didn't take the risk of being stuck. No services. Preserve nature please."
394121,2699682,5,alsospe,26/04/2023,"Nice place with a great view, very quiet. We left early in the morning, on the way back we met a GNR car, no idea if the other campers were fined."
394121,2565135,5,jobweel,31/01/2023,Dirt road. First I walked the path or see if it would go. In the end a beautiful spot and fun test
394123,2692078,5,hekla60,23/04/2023,"Very small area (maximum 6 meters! Avoid longer vehicles as they will block the way to the rest) but with charm, free services and tranquility. Interesting route of the ancient olive trees. Many thanks to the Canet Lo Roig town hall."
394123,2679716,4,lesnews,18/04/2023,"area for motorhome maximum 6 m, the site is so small and narrow not easy to maneuver. This area is a pocket handkerchief in a slightly raised rectangle of 11mx20m you have 4 places plus the location for services. If the 4 places are occupied, you will not be able to enter to do the emptying unless you go up the steep slope in reverse"
394123,2676486,5,mariaviver,17/04/2023,"Very good site! Quiet, clean and cosy. We have spent a very good night, alone. We have bought bread and other things. I like it!"

394123,2612263,5,oblivion1234,17/03/2023,"Brand new- everything is there. So cool with wooden benches around the side you can sit or lay on and relax or eat, have coffee etc. Is soo quiet, especially at night! Beautiful view. A road in front of you but not many cars passes by. It was a little cold, cloudy when we were here so we decided to drive further inland otherwise we would have stayed several days."
394123,2604032,5,park4nightbuerstner,09/03/2023,"Beautiful, new pitch, illuminated, V/E and free water. Beautiful hikes to a hermitage and especially to the thousand-year-old olive trees. These trees are magnificent and just beautiful. Thank you to the community. We've been there twice and will definitely be back."

394165,2767665,5,URi2021,20/05/2023,This is the absolute insider tip! A friendly service man fills our German 11 kg aluminum bottle with his own adapter technology in no time at all. €21.90. Perfect.
394165,2756902,5,philruli,17/05/2023,Everything as already described. Glad to have filled our German gas bottles for an affordable price.

394165,2720479,4,guissem,03/05/2023,Convenient to do everything there but lacks a way to rinse the toilet cassette where it is emptied. And we would appreciate if the goalkeeper spoke something other than just Spanish.

394165,2664633,5,joan53,12/04/2023,everything has already been said but I would like to testify to the quality of this service station which offers all services to CCs including a laundromat! I wish there were many more places like this!

The managers were uncooperative and to get LPG we went to another distributor where they solved our problem and even sold us the adapter at a reasonable price."

Here u can get even your gas bottles from ur own country refilled. So yes,it is not the best place, but the service guy is super kind & u have all the services. & if u find something broken, just report to staff instead killing the place with bad reviews. Thank u Tarifa."
394165,2576180,2,blabliblaaaaaa,13/02/2023,"Only 2 stars because everything is on site. Have been there several times. Were rushed to pay when filling with water, just doesn't run faster. The gas station is dingy, as is the laundromat. Gaskets were moldy and dirty - no wonder the guy closes them after use. The vacuum cleaner is a waste of money-hole in the hose."
394165,2573739,5,Excalibur157,10/02/2023,Small gas station where you can do service. I filled up German gas bottles - the waiter had an adapter and showed me how to do it. Very nice and helpful staff.
394165,2572254,4,finniundjuliontour,09/02/2023,"If you fill up with gas or petrol, the complete service is free of charge.

Please note: the swimming pool is still under construction but given the rest, nothing to say!"

394167,2933326,5,22Bluey,07/07/2023,Thank you for a wonderful stay! Robert and co were very friendly & welcoming and our girls loved the animals. Beautiful and peaceful spot where we had shade. Bonus of having facilities too. Construction ongoing but it didn’t affect things for us-no early or late noise. Good luck with the building project and hope to see it finished one day!!
394167,2895817,5,peteer,26/06/2023,humorous welcome from the owner and a friend.  We felt comfortable and at home right away.  The animals are wonderful.  It's like a spa in nature

394167,2751981,1,triciaglover,15/05/2023,"I really wanted to be positive about your spot. However. Charging 20€ to park on a dirt track with building under construction with no view, is a bit expensive. I honestly think you should hold off hosting untill all your building plans are complete. Also access to your spot for anything over 6mtrs is tight."
394167,2687854,5,Leon.lange,22/04/2023,"We spent one night in this wonderful place. Everyone here is incredibly nice and always open to a good conversation. Although the small oasis is still under construction, we lacked nothing. The shower with a view of nature was a great experience. Particular attention is paid to the good use of the surrounding nature. I look forward to coming back again in the future!"
394167,2633256,5,Carry02ontour,01/04/2023,"Very hospitable people, quiet location, special place to spend a night or two :) We arrived here completely relaxed, enjoying the luxury of running water, a toilet and a sauna. It is best to call ahead to see if something is free."
394167,2607279,5,RagnarLua,12/03/2023,"Site under construction. It looks very good, it will have a pool, which can be quite a luxury. We stopped for lunch, a nap and very well, very quiet. We will be back!! One of the guys who manages it very friendly!"
394167,2602600,5,Jossep,08/03/2023,"We enjoyed two wonderful peaceful nights in this little paradise in the making. With fresh eggs from the chickens in the morning and a campfire in the evening with the people who lived & worked there at the moment. They work for board & lodging on the realization of an ecological paradise with swimming pool, dry toilet, vegetable garden. There is no opportunity to discharge toilet or waste water"
394167,2593921,5,samb92,28/02/2023,"It was an amazing place to stay, so much so we stayed for another night! 
It is still under construction, but you can still enjoy the amenities, like a super hot shower or relax in the sauna. 
This place is up and coming, it was a pleasure to see it on its journey. Next time we visit, we hope it's finished, and we can take a dip in the pool! 
A relaxing and quiet place to stay, highly recommend."

Prices from 4-6 euros and dryer 2 and 3 for 25 minutes. We have never had dryers that hot. 25 minutes was enough for the whole wash. Furthermore, you can easily park your mobile home in front of it."

394169,2650728,3,marikali,08/04/2023,Beautiful spot to stay during the day with the van. We slept there on Monday it wasn’t to noise but there is no much of privacy. No WC no toilet.

You can also go shopping there. Way to the city is 15 minutes walk through nice streets. The entrance to the car park is very narrow, caution is advised, but it is easily manageable with our van."
394179,2600496,1,lisabrr,06/03/2023,"Exchanged a Campingaz 907 bottle here. It seemed quite light to us, so we weighed it and it was actually over 1.3kg missing, which means it was only half full! The price of €17.70 is too much for that. Wouldn't recommend changing the gas bottle here."

394248,3242257,4,Fabviva,31/08/2023,"A place with spectacular views, super quiet. Small parking, three spaces maximum. When we went we were alone so we had the balcony available. Access is a little complicated due to the steep slopes, narrow road and when passing through the town there are very narrow steps. If your vehicle doesn't go well on long, steep slopes, don't risk it."

394277,2677023,4,Ithaki,17/04/2023,"We really liked it. The hosts Maria and Alvaro were very friendly and helpful. The view and the tranquility is great. Our WoMo has a length of 7.4 m and a width of 2.3 m. In order to get through the gate onto the property, you need a lot of driving skills with this size. We would stay there again anytime."
394277,2631541,5,Rasselbande4x4,31/03/2023,Very nice parking space with a lovely family. Great mountain views! Small playground for children and shady areas under the centuries-old olive trees. We felt totally comfortable and would love to come back. Extremely nice hosts!!
394277,2591037,5,daferner,25/02/2023,"Very cool place and very nice hosts!! They speak perfect english, so ist was easy to talk and to geht tips about the region. Sadly our Camper was a little low (space between ground and car) to come in. But they have been so friendly and helpful, that we would come back anytime!! You will have a nice time here! And i guess in short time they have fixed the entrance and you will easyly enter."
394277,2575637,5,officiallyold,12/02/2023,Absolutely faboulous place and super nice host family with a very friendly dog! Mountains around and the yard is a paradice with dogs (and i guess with kids too).  There is a separate toilet and shower for guests and you can use the terrace next to the house to cook and eat or just sit in the sun. Will definitely return on my next trip.
394280,2825525,3,montanja,06/06/2023,We didnt stay as the place didnt seem very suitable for a rooftop tent van. Your right under the balcony of some people living there. The views are OK but there’s quite a slope with no even options.
394280,2664992,5,susu278,12/04/2023,"The place was perfect for us, I think there would have been space for more than 2 campers. We spent 2 nights there in Holy Week with our VW bus and watched the Passion Play and the Easter procession. No infrastructure, far enough away from town that you can sleep when the locals are still partying! Slightly oblique."

394311,2575922,4,TaijaH,12/02/2023,There's wide and good shaped dirt road. Just make sure to turn left from the juction of abandoned houses. Other road gets super narrow and steep with slippery mud. We almost got stuck. We choosed not to drive up in the hill as there are another spots to park next to the road close to this spot. Here you can be all alone with beautiful views. We didn't see or hear anyone.
394328,3292303,5,vivigeneva,13/09/2023,"Place next to a basketball court which seems abandoned. Breathtaking view of the city. Possibility of going to town on foot in 10 minutes. There are two accesses. The first one indicated by the GPS is quite steep, there is another one a little further away, less steep. Calm assured."
394328,3129099,5,junss,12/08/2023,"We spent a pleasant night there. however, we initially landed on the grass next to the soccer field. but there was a lot of rubbish and a lot of bees. we moved next to the chapel on the bitumen. a few cars come to rest in the evening"
394328,3048879,5,gauliert,30/07/2023,Perfect spot on the heights of Toledo. Quiet for the night we saw no one. Access from above is actually easier. Exit from the bottom left of the sports field. Placed a little higher than the ground at the foot of a chapel on flat tar. The view is even better. Visit of Toledo by the bridge below. Be careful it climbs. We were in a van. Harder camping
394328,2771139,5,Vitvitvito,21/05/2023,"Perfect for its proximity to Toledo, yet feeling out of the hustle and bustle and quiet. Nice view. Really flat land that can accommodate several vehicles (4 or 5 max). Some passages of sportsmen and nice dog walkers in the morning. His grade point average could be better."
394328,2738570,4,JeanRenard,10/05/2023,"Possibility to park the camper around a fenced sports field. Can't beat the fantastic view of Toledo, especially at night when the sights are floodlit. Below the square are residential buildings, I felt safe. And just below (5 min.) is the old bridge to the city - perfect! Tip: Approach from above."
394328,2704301,4,carocach66,28/04/2023,Spot with breathtaking views of Toledo and 15 minutes from the center on foot. We stayed 2 nights. Too bad the site is not very clean...

The surroundings are dirty, toilet paper, cans, fast food packaging. A recurring image in Spain unfortunately. Access is from the top and not the bottom as the gps may indicate. A large CC will not pass!!!"
394328,2570877,5,vely03,07/02/2023,Very quiet place to sleep with a good view of the historic part of Toledo. We spent the night in the car and no one came. That if very cold in February. Otherwise great.
394328,2560683,5,amelieden,26/01/2023,"Quiet site, above the city. Which does not spoil the view. At night you can see the whole city lit up, it's beautiful. We are not far from the city center while being in a green place. My dog loves it! Tourist office 25 minutes on foot. Town 15 minutes away. Black spots: people who leave tissues everywhere!!! the aging hand court can be a Good spot!"

394339,2587862,4,Stuehring,23/02/2023,"The place is new and actually offers everything you need. The staff is very friendly and helpful. However, I have to deduct a star because at a price of 28 € per night I would have expected 5 degrees in winter that the sanitary facilities and showers would be heated. In addition, the pitches are so sloping that you can sleep on a ""slope"" even with ramps."

394471,3246824,3,Euytony,01/09/2023,"The staff was pleasant and polite, but the campsite was old, expensive, dark, with almost no lighting, and not very suitable for motorhomes. The few plots available were narrow, wide, yes, but with a lot of permanent settlement. I see it only if you want to park and visit Valencia with the bus that stops at the door. To go from AC no."

394471,3001672,3,ntrippinsx,22/07/2023,We arrived at 8pm after getting the ferry. No spaces available.. Only parking and we still had to pay €35 per night. The washing machine was also broken.. They did not want us to empty black water there
394471,2959218,2,labiche76,13/07/2023,Good for one night clean showers and toilets but you have to leave before noon otherwise you pay for a second night big downside mosquitoes ☹️
394471,2832308,1,caddyot,08/06/2023,Okay for 1 night to explore Valencia but no longer. Mosquitoes eat you up. Showers take some getting used to without a lock or hook to hang them up. Toilets are ok but without toilet paper.
394471,2816124,2,bemom,03/06/2023,"How judged.... complicated... it's the only place in the area with a reasonable price... But But... the motorhomes are on top of each other. But the problem is the 'Offer and demand. so profit is in order. On the other hand, at the roundabout 300 m from here, head for the beach, several motorhomes at the edge of the beach with plenty of places.. but no service may be the right solution"
394471,2778432,3,Fam.SchmiFa,23/05/2023,"Good location. Campsite with a lot of potential but Markel and staff distanced, inflexible and unfriendly as described. AcsiCard: -Parking spaces along a fence to the dog park or the street. -Per infant (2 years) 5 €/day extra!!! -(Full price although the pool area is being repaired.) Valencia with bus line 24 25 departs directly in front of the entrance, 10-15 minutes in the city, €1.50 per trip/adult."

394471,2706663,3,johanasoley,29/04/2023,"the place is very good. Although it says that it has 50 places, many are permanently occupied, leaving only a few available. When we checked-in, they kept our ID until we checked-out. Correct services. Close to the beach and lagoon, where there are paths to ride a bike. Bus stop to go to the Museum of arts and sciences and the center of Valencia."
394471,2665618,2,AneB,12/04/2023,"If it wasn't for the friendly front desk staff, we would have given it only one star. Expensive, old facilities and in poor condition, lots of mosquitos, lots of sand and dust, dry environment, permanent campers shouting, TV volume too loud. Txabolismoa El Saler near the town, but this too is outdated and with few services. A good way to approach Valencia by bike."
394471,2656924,4,DavidOShells,10/04/2023,"Correct, comfortable and functional campsite. Well located to visit Valencia and the Albufera. Good services for children. Maybe a little expensive, (37.50 2 adults, 2 children and AC)"

Ideal for combining a visit to Valencia by bus (you can even go there by bike), immense beaches and a walk in the Albufera. Book in season otherwise you will have to go your way!"
394471,2606347,1,ADI57,11/03/2023,"The place is absolutely not recommended. The only plus point is the friendly lady at the reception. Otherwise no soap, no toilet paper, no shelves in front of the showers and no Wifi."
394471,2600448,3,vQtShZoXX6J9nCF,06/03/2023,"Solid campsite as described in the other comments. Sometimes very narrow paths between the pitches, which were only just passable even with our small mobile home."

394471,2574294,2,MarieL41,11/02/2023,"Avoid! The toilets are clean, that's about the only advantage of this place: we are on the side of a very noisy road, power cut between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m. when it's still cold and no commercial gesture. We were there with the ACSI card, €15 per night but frankly zero. There is only one washing machine and the dryer runs for 1 hour, the clothes are not dry! Go your way!!"
394471,2565254,4,Jackschupp,31/01/2023,"Stayed here on 06/01/23 for 2 nights. A few slots kept free amongst the evidently fairly permanent residents. Quite closely spaced and very shady. Restaurant and supermarket on site but closed when we were there, although think the restaurant was only closed for 3 Kings and the weekend. Friendly and accommodating staff and a great location with the El Saler coastal cycle path close by."
394471,2559564,4,SabineKlause,24/01/2023,Really a good starting point to visit Valencia. Take the bus to Valencia almost right in front of the gate of the square for €1.50. Sanitary facilities are older and very clean when we visited.

394482,2633956,5,matteokn,01/04/2023,"Wonderful place. In front of this ""steep slope"" is a large turning area. Once you have passed the car test, you should reach this place without any problems :) Wonderful peace. Possibly not suitable for large mobile homes."

Even a separate machine for washing dog blankets, for example, so that this type of laundry does not have to be put in the other washing machines. Could easily park on the street."
394489,2556846,3,Ederest,21/01/2023,"It is the closest to visit the town, but the other car parks are better for spending the night. We stayed here for a couple of nights due to the rainy season and the danger of flooding in the other car parks that were next to the river. It is not very intimate since it is where everyone parks and next to the entrance of the town."

394495,2981478,5,didiyguru,18/07/2023,"Perfect place to spend the day at the beach, at night it is better to go to the other side of the road to a dirt parking lot with more vans, because this parking lot is empty."
394495,2969777,5,pan6ea,15/07/2023,Five star parking lot. Would recommend to park on the lower part of the lot close to the sea which is a bit quieter than the top part. There are two restaurants with decent prices and toilets nearby. Public restrooms open at 9am and showers on the beach at 11am.

394500,2652515,4,ManuelVte.,09/04/2023,"Keep in mind that it is a parking lot. It does not have any type of services, I say this because as I get up I see papers in the corners from spending the night. You have to bring the minimum to avoid dirtying the environment where we spend the night. It's bad for us like this. Otherwise it's level, there's plenty of space, it's pretty quiet, but it does get quite dusty because the ground is so dry."

Depending on the wind, one may hear the main road a bit. Locals pass by during the day. Do not enter when wet or rain, as it becomes easily muddy. A bit further down the gravel track you find some other spots too. Keep it clean!"

Seems quiet as not many cars drive up there, road has just been resurfaced so the access is great. Some rubbish and left overs from road work around the place. Didn’t stay the night and not sure if this would be permitted."

394683,3134162,5,Sadricone,13/08/2023,"We stayed overnight a little below the point because we arrived in the middle of the night and the 4x4 route was no longer so obvious. The path (gravel) was easy to drive up to our place, a little above the parking lot. A lift will definitely be needed later. There is one or two washouts.

394738,3189512,4,sarahella003,20/08/2023,"we slept here for two nights. no problems, except that there is no easy pipi spot around, but there are a few bars just down the street on the plaza. the place is quiet during the night."
394738,3170938,1,Azulazul,18/08/2023,"Disrespectful van drivers, brushing their teeth, hanging clothes on the railing, keep in mind that it is a parking lot surrounded by neighbors. They have already banned parking on the new promenade, some are going to get us banned from everything. You are one day and you leave, but with the apps for the neighbors it is one day after another of the same show."
394738,3144541,4,caro_lili,14/08/2023,"I confirm pleasant parking. Thirty places in the blue zone, free at night. Near the city, under the trees. rather for one night and a small vehicle."
394738,3125593,1,estebanav,11/08/2023,"On the third night, at 5am I was sleeping and a man opened the side door of the van for me, I got up furious and asked him what he was doing? and he didn't understand, he only spoke French, he pretended not to understand, when I tell him that I'm going to call “police” and I pick up my cell phone, he manages to hit me, I dodge him and he runs away. Result: broken mobile screen, poor security. Bad experience."
394738,3057138,5,KeiraMcCombie,01/08/2023,"Very beautiful park up, short walk to beach front and lots of shade from trees! A small walk from here there was outdoor live music. Such a fun and beautiful city! I couldn't recommend it more (not suitable for large motorhomes, a van as pictured is suitable max)"
394738,3053195,4,liamroot,31/07/2023,"We were traveling by car and slept in it there. The night was good, but the next morning we noticed how other people, who were also on the road with their vans and had been there for a few days, had an argument with the local residents. The police were also called, but nothing happened. Campers seem to be unpopular. (zone blue/green)"
394738,3031065,4,MathieuLlnn,27/07/2023,We were lucky there was a spot left in the parking lot at 2 p.m. Certainly it is small but very well placed and not expensive (until 2 p.m. the next day 3.50€)

394765,3288432,1,Barbgr,12/09/2023,"Unbearable. It was full of mosquitoes of all sizes but all equally murderous. It seems like it's a nighttime thing and it comforts you to think about the wonderful views you're going to have when you wake up, but the views aren't even wonderful and the mosquitoes are still even more furious."

Be careful not to get stuck in the sand, in some places there is a lot of sand, and not to get blocked in the parking lot by other cars."
394765,2723997,3,VWt420,05/05/2023,Great to stay for 1-2 days. Unfortunately a lot of rubbish in the parking lot. A few blocks away are bars that play loud music. Very nice beach!

Boardwalk that runs along the entire beach of Matalascañas. It would be appreciated if motorhomes did not empty the gray water in the parking lot.

The owners are very nice and friendly, always happy to help."
394771,2586617,5,mymyl,22/02/2023,Ideal for laundry and refueling. Do the laundry while Madame goes shopping at the Mercadona. WiFi code at the coin mechanism. You can park easily just behind 100m.

394778,2597982,4,sweety53639,04/03/2023,"great views of Lisbon and the bridge. It's best not to park in the middle when sleeping because that's where the fishermen meet, who play music and chat at 5:30 in the morning to get them in the mood. The place is big enough... or standing by the trees is also far enough away. the last 70 meters are very bumpy"
394807,3263955,5,SophCha,06/09/2023,"absolutely beautiful! 
we came up from the valley and it is a tough drive. the road from the lookout spot north from it is way better."
394807,3113568,5,blaclau,10/08/2023,"Spot just splendid. 360° aerial view, flat and accessible, very quiet. In summer the track is dusty so the van gets dusty too, but it's so worth it. No shade so in summer arrive at the end of the afternoon."
394810,3237859,5,pakuasukit,30/08/2023,"Extremely beautiful landscape, very spacious and flat pitch with a possibility for a shade. You have to be self sufficient and if that's what you're looking for then this is the place for you. The host couple were extremely friendly and welcoming. If the 15e sounds expensive, remember it is for a good cause. 
Escape the system.
Love from finland."

Whatever type of van you have, the thieves are specialised for robbing the vehicles as these are the only places you can park: in the city there is simply no free space.

The only complaint I would make is that they hold events from time to time in the bullring next door and it is hard to sleep. The beach is very close and the center is a short walk away, bars and supermarkets nearby."

Be careful of the water tap which diffuses on the sides when opened slightly and high flow when it is fully opened, which causes splashes when flushing the toilet for a small rinse."

Clean and new looking facilities that were ideal.  Looks like you could easily stop the night but we didn’t preferring more rural park ups.
394948,2653914,3,Caravanadominguera,09/04/2023,"It only has 5 spaces but you can park along the slopes or past the fence. Lots of kids playing soccer and moving around with the little motorcycles, but then they leave and it's quiet. A little dark, they could leave some light, but it's very good. There is a free loading and unloading area, they do not have a toilet tap to rinse the cassette. In the afternoon there is shade, from mñna the sun falls."
394948,2649253,5,ikerne77,08/04/2023,"Very quiet place, we spent one night, with a tap, drain..."

394948,2593058,3,Kim.S,27/02/2023,"There are 5, not 6 pitches. Garbage cans are behind the tennis court, as info for those who just throw it here. Many campers clean their chemical toilets with the drinking water tap and spread dangerous faecal germs because there is no tap to clean them. ugh! Behave! Also applies to the older generation and also to the French! And please don't piss in the flower bed anymore!"
394948,2566851,4,crigbee1,03/02/2023,"Brand new, nicely laid out and water available. Walked into the village, but no shops, restaurants and maybe one bar. Very noisy at night with the noise from the nearby road."
394948,2561822,5,patapi,27/01/2023,Small area fitted out for 6 vehicles Drainage gray water and cassette. Possibility to fill the water tank and all for free.

394952,2611197,4,protector,16/03/2023,"Slab access is not available. We stood next to the entrance to the picnic area. Dogs bark all around. Not loud, but when you go out for a walk with the dogs it intensifies and strains. If you have no strength and want to sleep, it will do. Certainly better than camping in Coin."
394952,2602921,4,BenjaminVa,08/03/2023,"We spent the first night at the location indicated (on the concrete slab): rather quiet, dogs barking quite far away but nothing unbearable. We had to park upstream (in front of the park entrance) on the second day, access to the concrete slab is now blocked, they have just planted trees."
394952,2575424,5,frjmb,12/02/2023,"Very quiet, several picnic tables, and ample parking in front. Despite being winter, the river that runs next to it is dry."

394962,2650573,3,psviteri,08/04/2023,We spent the night here because the mall area was full. no problem. 15 minutes walk from the center. somewhat noisy from traffic.
394962,2604784,4,hubreeve,10/03/2023,Large car park. Park in the middle so you don't get the noise from the gym and the loud music of young people's cars in the evening. Very quiet in the morning. 19 min walk from the cathedral or alcazhar which are really worth the visit.
394962,2583138,4,Perci123,19/02/2023,"We spent the night of 31/01, huge parking lot without service, were alone with a little noise from mopeds until 10:30 p.m. then quiet."

394999,2878855,5,JordanHollins,21/06/2023,"Access via a dirt track, easily accessible for any vehicle. Can be busy in the day, but quiet during the night, very windy due to its exposure but worth a stop! Great 360° views which show the vast landscape and sheer amount of wind turbines."
394999,2727095,5,padloks,06/05/2023,"Magnificent place the road is passable and very wide in some places the wind turbine blades have passed! And the view is breathtaking and beautiful walks are to be done on the plateau! In short, happiness! and the wind turbines are very quiet…. Unless I've gone deaf without realizing it!"
394999,2618506,1,MichelPoulain,21/03/2023,"I advise you not to spend there especially not at night, I woke up with headaches and dizziness, given the length of the track to access it I think it is of no interest, except for the view."
394999,2581415,4,Ederest,18/02/2023,"We spent one night in the place. The views were wonderful. Easy access, in the middle of nature and totally alone. We enjoyed the walks along the wind farm. The only drawback is that it was extremely windy."
394999,2578204,5,mtbBOSS,15/02/2023,"High exposed location with lots of wind due to the big fans... In the mornings no wind. The wind starts in the afternoon when the big fans get turned on. 

Lots of good bike trails in the area. Spent four days riding and have to go back there are so many trails.

The road up from Cadrete is fine for both bike and van.

Lots of locals visit the spot day and night. 

No services. Keep it clean."

395003,2598729,3,Ollie-land,04/03/2023,"We were there a few days ago. The water is not for drinking (not potable). There is an automatic place to wash the autocaravan and an employee suggested to pay for it (1 euro) to discharge the gray water as part of the washing procedure (it seems not official, but the infrastructure probably support it). There is 1 place there for a motorhome that is 3.1 meters height"
395003,2596829,1,jaro47,03/03/2023,"I have been here on March 3, 2023. It is not possible to discharge black water here. Probably not gray water either, unless it should be with staff permission and then in the cabins of the laundry department"
395003,2563654,1,Mirjam.Lawall,29/01/2023,"the employee said there is no drinking water and only very little water comes out, with a larger tank you stand there forever and block other cars that want to inflate their tires."

395019,2669868,5,OldAgeTr,14/04/2023,An immaculate service area easy dumping and good water pressure. 4 level parking places. Unfortunately the mobile phone signal is a very weak  3G signal only. So we had to move on after stopping for lunch because I needed the internet to sort out some things but will definitely come back and explore the town and surrounding area.
395019,2659730,4,hekla60,10/04/2023,Area with free services. Interesting hiking trails leave from the town. The area itself is not very charming but the initiative of the council is appreciated and we will return. Thank you Rossell!

395019,2586296,4,lizppzil,21/02/2023,"The water is now working.  The site has a slight slope but easily fixed by blocks. There is a good little supermarket 100m up the road.  There are the usual town noises: dogs and church bells were in the distance, and  traffic started about 7am but did not bother us. There are beautiful walks around the town and the roads to Vallebona and Bel are beautiful and very quiet."
395020,3104483,1,RUCLE,08/08/2023,"Cuevas de Almanzora does not want motorhomes to consume in its restaurants, supermarkets and gas stations. Total insecurity on the part of the urban police who discriminately fine motorhomes. Sultry. Mayor make you see it!!"

395027,2617181,5,dracaryslea,20/03/2023,"Breakfast with mountain panorama. When the park lady is there, the toilets are also open at the weekend and they are very clean. The place is just really beautiful, a small village with a free museum and not too many tourists. I stayed there for two nights."
395027,2562282,5,GassieAliaan,28/01/2023,"we had a very quiet night. Toilets can be used in the park, where a sign says closed between 22-08h. Both toilets had a 220V outlet that we used to charge our laptop and toothbrushes ;-)"

395143,2563271,5,EY660,29/01/2023,"From our point of view the best car park on the west side of Maspalomas. Quiet, close to nature and restaurants. The further down you park, the better. There is a company at the top of the street that can make some noise in the mornings"
395145,2640527,4,suusaa,05/04/2023,"A beautiful place by a castle on the largest granite rock on the Iberian Peninsula. Unfortunately, when we were there (Tuesday evening in April) it was surprisingly busy. Even during the night, cars kept coming, driving past at high speed over the cobblestones on both sides. So it wasn't a particularly quiet night. The parking lot at the top of the castle is too steep"

395173,2990532,2,OlatzVdl,20/07/2023,"Only recommended if you have to stop yes or yes, if you can choose, don't stay: - Noise: people gather there, they don't have a big party but they are talking around the van. The last ones left at 5 in the morning and it's Wednesday night, the weekend... - Heat: it's July and the sun rises at 7. There isn't any shade."

395173,2609923,3,alizeeks,15/03/2023,"The parking lot is well located, with a pleasant view. On the other hand, I couldn't sleep before dawn because young people were talking out loud and playing music in their car next to me until 5 am. Yet it was a Sunday evening."
395173,2579392,4,profilrundreise0802,16/02/2023,Approach relatively steep. Suitable for vans and vans. 4 places available. Great views of part of the city and Mediterranean Sea. Dog owners come by during the day. In the evening peaceful young adults are sometimes on site. Everything within reason. Free good parking space to get downtown in 20 minutes. Plan double the time for the return trip.

395183,2569791,1,BlueTravelmate,05/02/2023,Bad place in a residential area. parking lot is not straight at all. And stands on a precipice. We looked for another place.
395191,2566653,5,cloudytours,02/02/2023,"A warm shower for €3 perfect! You don't necessarily need a locker because the shower is big enough without getting your stuff wet (there is a chair in it). Shower gel and towel are also provided! However, I find €1 for the toilet inappropriate."

We left him the equivalent of a nightly rental for his caravan with toilets, i.e. €10. Well deserved! For those who don't have anything available, it's best to call in advance. The places are very quiet."

395294,2611426,5,misifumalu,16/03/2023,We were going for one night and we stayed several. Jordi is very attentive and kind. He is improving the place so that it is getting better and better: it already has electricity and water. Very nice view in the middle of the field. Perfect to enjoy nature and rest. We also did a couple of walks but it is advisable to take bikes to better enjoy the location and surrounding towns. thank you jordi

395340,3103441,5,crisjotacapa,08/08/2023,"Great! We stopped for one night, on the way to our destination... and we stayed for three! Good restaurants, supers, ideal beach, very nice locals! Recommended 100./."
395340,2610792,5,OscarHevia,15/03/2023,"Perfect out of summer season, somewhat narrow street but without problems for about 6 motorhomes, parking only, the existing toilets are closed at this time"
395340,2599561,2,up4new,05/03/2023,"Can only be used in the off-season, otherwise parking spaces are taken away from local residents. Only suitable for vans as the street is very narrow, otherwise the passage is blocked. The two junctions / curves in front of it are also not feasible for large mobile homes if the curves are blocked."
395340,2596975,4,mancalobos,03/03/2023,"Yes, it's okay, in high season it will be difficult because there is a summer terrace right where you park."
395340,2588999,5,CandGVanlife,24/02/2023,"Lovely and peaceful and gorgeous views. The sound of the waves could be heard, the sea only 25 metres from our van. Most bars / restaurants nearby closed but a 15 minute walk and there was a good choice. You are parked in front of houses, which we felt a bit guilty about, but no problems and local police passed without comment."
395340,2577295,4,SteffiWittig,14/02/2023,"Parking right on the street with the beach in front. Supermarket about 2km away, within walking distance. No V/E, small trash cans on the beach"

395401,2856644,1,MysticMonkey,15/06/2023,Apparently this part of the mountain is a private estate and the owner does not like cars or vans to park on this site. There is also a lot of traffic of fishermen.
395405,3182260,4,zurix,19/08/2023,Quiet parking near the church.
395405,3028498,5,rozarilloyole,27/07/2023,"Beautiful town, the parking lot for the night is super quiet, the entire town and its beautiful fortress church of San Miguel are worth a visit."

395476,2647636,1,Carmeta77,07/04/2023,Indeed the black ones do not work and it seems that from a long time ago due to the sign that there is ect…. They have no idea how to fix it. It's a pity I didn't see the comments sooner.
395476,2645156,1,elikisco,06/04/2023,The black water does not work and I see that it is usual since there are comments above with the same problem. There is another gas station in the La Pañoleta polygon very close to there with all the services and much better access.
395476,2615261,5,MiSchroe,19/03/2023,"We only filled up with fresh water. The water pressure is good and with a double Alb filter (active nano) we got about 75 liters for one euro. It is best to drive into the car wash, then you can simply drive out to the front afterwards."
395476,2582331,4,Wolfgang.wuerz,18/02/2023,You can empty gray water and fill up with plenty of water for €1. Too bad the toilet disposal doesn't work.
395476,2571039,2,spexy,07/02/2023,"The water is still working and you can still dump grey water. The black waste is still currently broken.

It's a really badly designed service station.  The service point is next to the van wash so you need to drive onto it to fill with water. Very little space to move around especially when busy but does the job with little else in the area."
395476,2566016,1,EmilieBerge,01/02/2023,"It does not work. Black water emptying is broken, and grey water closed."

395512,3293645,5,Happyanimal,13/09/2023,"Spectacular vacation! It's the second time I've gone, once in high season and once in low season, both impressive. The staff was always attentive to what I needed at all times, the facilities were very clean, a quiet area and 10 to rest and disconnect. In addition, very close there is a leisure and shopping area, and a very beautiful cove. There are not 2 without 3! I will return, the best there is."

395512,3291282,1,DeonWise,13/09/2023,"The staff are not that friendly. The WC not really clean and they charge you £1 to have a shower every time. the pool is very small and right next to the motorway, they are also more expensive than the other sites in the area too."
395512,3291215,1,JasonAndClara,13/09/2023,"Rubbish, they make you dizzy with the prices every week, we booked in August for €30 (with 2 children) for September, speaking with another couple, they told us that they had been charged €12.50, we went to complain and they sent us to shit basically. They charged us whatever they wanted. Another thing to highlight is the entrance, we came with an 8 meter caravan and getting in is mission impossible. We will not return."
395512,3289528,5,FamiliaMuDel,12/09/2023,"It's been incredible. The facilities are all new and they have also thought of all the details, even an area to wash pets up high.

The price of the shower is €1/6 minutes but it gives you plenty of time. Just 5 minutes away by bus that takes you to Benidorm promenade (line 2). The electricity is separate, I have paid 10 cents for one day (I have charged mobile phones, flashlights, lights...) so that is preferable at a fixed price."

The price 12.50 was the month of June that they made an offer, in July and August it is somewhat more expensive but understandable due to the high season. A campsite of 10."
395512,2915446,1,EugeniaGomez,02/07/2023,"We are disappointed. We came yesterday and spent the night. At the time of paying, they charged us another amount than what it says on the page. We have paid €25 for 3 people (+separate shower), instead of €12.50 + €5. We have complained but they have not given us any solution. Beware of the prices and with these people.

Thanks for making something we all feel good about."

The hot water does not come out in all the showers, the drains do not swallow well, so if you shower in the first one, the water from the others reaches your feet. The shower costs 0.50. In the morning the bins in the bathroom had not been changed or cleaned. It is expensive for the services it offers, because it is Easter: €20 for 1 minicamper and 2 people."

It seems logical to me since in other areas we have been to they charge you a minimum of €5 per day and it seems excessive and on top of that it is constantly cut. Very friendly and responsive staff. We will be back.

395512,2594003,1,arturo_camper,28/02/2023,"This area is a fraud, it's already very very expensive €15 then you have to pay for the showers (not even hot!!) in addition for 6 minutes that you can't share with your wife, then you have to pay the electricity and you have to put up with the boss' insults if you explain to him that it's not normal. Leave this place, it's the worst in spain."

395512,2593500,5,Nordstern536,28/02/2023,"Call back after phone contact! Nice reception. We are here for the second time. The construction sites don't bother you, you're out and about during the day and it's quiet at night. Tip: walk to the bay of Finestrat and at the parking lot follow the blue trail to Torre d'Aguiló. A bit steep in parts, but the destination with the panoramic view is worth it."
395512,2592464,5,Magmimi,27/02/2023,"superb area for motorhomes, very well equipped, owner and very friendly and helpful staff, to recommend without hesitation 15 euros electricity according to consumption showers, WC, laundry .... an excellent memory of Benidorm with bus and tram nearby"
395512,2592376,5,SergioLerin,26/02/2023,"Great area with electricity, water and drainage services in the plots themselves, level and spacious. Next to a shopping center with plenty of restaurants. The road to the Finestrat cove or western beach in less than 30 min, or buses nearby. Highly recommended of course."
395512,2589647,4,racmac,24/02/2023,"New parking space with modern. Service, showers, 2 world cups, 2 dryers, very nice staff, large pitches, gas bottles! Disadvantage: very, very steep ascent and descent, many have already touched down, sharp white gravel, no green all around, very bad for dog paws, two relatively new and very dusty construction sites, next to and directly in front of the parking space, what and how long they go is questionable?"
395512,2589533,5,Kerrybentley,24/02/2023,very good for price new clean long walk to benidorm centre but transport available beach not far would recommend  15€ Per night
395512,2587343,5,winypu,22/02/2023,new parking. very well leveled. water connection on plot and plug as well. cost for one night with light 15 euros. Pleasent treatment. toilets and showers very clean. easy access. It is likely that in the future you will have to reserve the plot before going because of how good it is. 5 km from the center of Benidorm that you can go for a walk
395512,2580043,5,eeae,16/02/2023,Excellent newly inaugurated area with first class services. To shower you have to put 1 euro for 6 minutes of water. This is due to the abuse of hot water consumption that causes there to be times when it only comes out cold. It seems they are fixing the problem. There is a swimming pool and barbecue area.
395512,2578127,2,Nani82,14/02/2023,"very nice hosts. very well laid out area, drinking water and gray water disposal at each pitch, electricity and all the services of a campsite. 10 minutes walk from the beach and the market, as much to go to the shopping center. 6 km from Benidorm. Too bad the electricity is at an exorbitant price and not related to consumption !!!!!!"

It's a pity about the path that is right next to it, people don't collect the paper they use to relieve themselves, you have to be clean or there won't be places like this anymore!!!"
395697,2897725,5,KnightBusTravel,27/06/2023,"Beautiful pitch. Unfortunately, everything was full here on the first evening and we had to park elsewhere. The place is very popular. In the second night we could stand here. Recommendation: Be sure to get up at 6 a.m. and watch the sunrise over the sea! So beautiful! And one more tip: it's better to walk to the beach, there are hardly any parking spaces below and there are often jellyfish in the bay. Caution!!!"

Right next to it is the entrance to a chalet, I don't think the owner would like to park there, although there is no prohibited sign. It is actually like a space next to the road that leads to the chalets in the area. A little walk downhill is the famous cove that is very pretty."

But thanks to a well-paved road, it can be done without any problems. After the steep approach, follow the 300m road to the parking space. The view is very nice and it is very quiet thanks to the absence of traffic."

Few cars and few people pass by during the day. Perhaps the biggest drawback is that it had little coverage with Movistar. The noise of the highway and the train did not disturb. Please keep the place clean."

I had to run out looking for emergency veterinary assistance. Two weeks sick."

396051,2575259,5,bentelarsen,12/02/2023,a nice place to stay almost right in front of the bakery and nice beach
396054,2601251,2,Lupiote,06/03/2023,"Arrived in the early afternoon, pretty and quiet. Until a car idling by our truck, once, twice, then a third time at night (the 3 times it was the same car)... It parked at 20 meters further, headlights on, and started to turn around towards us... we left very quickly with a big feeling of insecurity. Be careful !"
396054,2578387,5,Fredpsq,15/02/2023,Great spot very quiet. We hear the road a little from afar but nothing bothersome for us. No car passed. Nice view.
396057,3122164,5,Fernando14,11/08/2023,"Quiet place at the foot of Tindaya with flat terrain and little light pollution, good for stargazing"
396077,2590205,1,TJW1,25/02/2023,Guardia Civil moved us and 4 other small vans / motorhomes on during the evening of 22/02/23. No sleeping there apparently. Unfortunately the official Aire in Casares was full (as it usually is). This car park was almost empty which is why we all ended up on this one. We are obviously not welcome. One to avoid.
396080,2584508,5,digitalvannomad,20/02/2023,Great place to stop and buy a Moroccan SIM card and do some shoppings at Marjane.
396089,2571248,4,PeterKerekes,07/02/2023,Caution very difficult to reach / only for 4x4 or very experienced driver.
396107,3269534,4,Mo40,07/09/2023,Out of service however by asking reception she agreed that we use another hose made available for 10L maximum
396107,3180567,5,lauraundtim,19/08/2023,Free water! Just ask at the gas station and they will give you a hose. The water fills up within minutes
396107,3160988,5,andreavelario,16/08/2023,The tap for the water didn't work but they provided another tap with a hose attached. It took me a couple of minutes to fill 100 litres. all free
396107,3078459,5,SandraGOUVEIA,05/08/2023,no more tap but there is another water point nearby.
396107,2923486,4,alicialtne,04/07/2023,A gas station with a small terminal to inflate the tires. 2 pipes one for air and one for water. Press the end of the black tip to release the water. It's a bit long but it does the job very well! And it's free!
396130,2652066,1,LGutierrez,09/04/2023,"Nobody answered to open and to enter to spend the night at the door I saw a sign that said family members only, it seems private."
396130,2618351,2,stoter,21/03/2023,"Camper place along a busy road. We had come here to wash the bedding and clothes, but the owner who does that for the customers didn't do it today. Electricity not possible unless you have 50 meters of cable. WiFi not found. In short, not our place"
396139,2807408,5,guissem,31/05/2023,"Excellent laundry, clean and efficient."
396139,2593706,5,hasenteufel,28/02/2023,"super clean laundromat. However, very bad for parking with the mobile home. You have to be lucky that there is a free parking space in the street."
396161,3094808,1,ssqquuaal,07/08/2023,"Permanently closed apparently .. If so, it would be nice to update the announcement from the owner."
396161,2766122,5,WoMoChriss,20/05/2023,"From the outside, not so inviting at first glance, but everything inside is great and clean. The operator is always there and happy to help. Entrance in the side street, ring the bell and he comes immediately. Washing possible everything there and only 40 minutes walk to the center"
396161,2683589,4,haul,20/04/2023,"New place with flat parking areas and large guyed plots, the trees are still small. Secure locked area. Sanitary facilities with 2 toilets and 1 shower with a curtain a bit poor in the large hall, but clean. You can't walk to the center, 10 minutes by taxi, about 10 euros. Very friendly staff, few Womo in April."
396161,2649947,4,joshi_es,08/04/2023,"We have spent a day and a night. Closed and totally protected place. The owner and staff, very friendly. The toilets and showers are perfect. There are even bath gels and shampoos available to customers. Something away from the city. To the cathedral 45 min walk. Better to go by bike or car. In the middle of Holy Week we were only 3 motorhomes."
396161,2624702,5,Nanouvincent13,26/03/2023,Perfect. brand new. very clean and very well secured. very flat. the caretaker is there 24 hours a day and very kind and helpful. By bike 10 minutes from the historic center. I recommend .
396161,2614222,2,gracieparks,18/03/2023,"A warm welcome, the site is very clean. feels like a prison having to be checked in and out and high fence. Two stars because we felt quite cheated, Says €18 a night , EHU was 3€ a night, Showers are 1€ five mins. Washing mach4€ drier 3€ (warning,drums are tiny so half a load,) so turned out incredibly expensive. Wish we had stayed at the site on the east side of the city."
396161,2608277,5,GSCOSTA,13/03/2023,Absolutely recommended. Good area and very good treatment. THANK YOU
396161,2602125,5,rudi.ratlos,07/03/2023,"If our time in Spain wasn't running out, we would have loved to have stayed a few more days. Murcia is absolutely worth seeing and there is also a lot to discover in the surrounding area. (We have a car with us) Everything has already been said about the parking space, we are happy to recommend it. Many thanks to Simon and staff."
396161,2601075,4,Tesoro463,06/03/2023,"Good place to rest and then visit Murcia, pleasant well-kept environment with bathrooms, showers. Spacious plots with current and water in each one of them. Very nice owner who tries to give you solutions if you have problems. To walk to the center you have to go a stretch through streets without sidewalks or shoulders that can be dangerous at night, return by taxi. If I go back to Murcia I will come back here"
396161,2600865,5,CharlotteRob,06/03/2023,"We stayed for one night - no complaints from us. The facilities were really clean although there's only 2 showers and only one has a curtain stopping water going everywhere so as it gets busier this might cause issues.

It was just us and about 4 other vans though so no problems.

Was easy to cycle into Murcia."
396161,2600582,4,Womobe,06/03/2023,"Everything is new and fresh, you always get a seat, it has only been open for 18 days, the owner on site is very friendly and happy to help, ideal for visiting the city"
396161,2600326,4,Roarsome4some,06/03/2023,This place is brand new and only just opened. The owner Simon is very welcoming and is happy to help in anyway. The site is level and clean. The location is quiet and not to far from Murcia. About a 30min walk to Centre. On the way you get to pass through some local neighborhoods. I would definitely stay again.
396161,2597406,4,marbuffy,03/03/2023,"Area recently opened, but convenient for visiting the center by bicycle, it can be reached in 15 minutes. Very nice manager, ready to answer all your questions. Also convenient for those who arrive late as there is always a guardian who can let you in"
396161,2591447,4,stoter,26/02/2023,"It was equally difficult to find. Spacious camper pitches, friendly welcome by Simon. Camper place only just opened, which makes it look rather bare. But great place to discover Murcia from here"
396172,2746799,4,Phil10kn,13/05/2023,"Convenient location, meets what is expected: a place to spend the night. No services. No view because surrounded by walls. Very calm. Much better than on the coast. Shops nearby."
396184,3205300,5,FEDRIGO,23/08/2023,"A mini campsite that looks like a big one. Natalia the owner is lovely. The pitches are large with water and electricity and Wifi which works perfectly. The sanitary facilities are nickel. This mini campsite is just perfect, we will come back with pleasure. Shops are nearby as well as the town which is 10 minutes by car."
396184,3198429,4,Cris2912,22/08/2023,"Nice little campsite. We stayed one night, we were able to flush the WC, wash clothes and fill up. Close to supermarkets and restaurants. Super quiet and cool night. I'm not giving it 5 stars because they didn't have to unload the gray water but we did it at a nearby gas station. We fell in love with the manager's bitch Mika"
396184,2893647,4,XinoXanoVans,26/06/2023,We discovered the place by chance and we were pleasantly surprised. Natalia is the manager and she is very kind. There were few people and we had almost everything to ourselves. Quiet place and very close to supermarkets and a concert bar. It is also 5 mnts from the beach of La Marina. Add that the bar service would improve a bit. And it would be perfect. See you soon!!
396184,2612920,3,Joeherman,17/03/2023,"Nice little place. price incl. shower,"
396189,2784454,2,lorenitalory,25/05/2023,"park your van in the smallest space you can, the locals seem to own the land, it is not possible to get water from the source of teror, water only for residents of teror"
396191,3090582,3,everdina,06/08/2023,drive through spain ... rubbish everywhere so it is not surprising that this place is also littered ..... nevertheless take your own rubbish and dog waste with you
396191,2701064,1,Mobi4x4,27/04/2023,"place is ok as already mentioned, a lot of rubbish. But it would have been okay for one night. But there are strange people here. Young man in a silver seat kept staring at us from 3 meters away. definitely not ""normal"" behavior. feel and not safe and drive on."
396191,2669093,3,martenchristine,14/04/2023,Dirty but good by the sea and quiet
396191,2593934,1,JuditaD.,28/02/2023,Such a shame - without all the trash/plastic around it would be a wonderful spot!
396205,3083734,4,Defender86,05/08/2023,"Fixed track, you can get there with any vehicle, very quiet and relaxing place, there are not many places to put the car on the flat to sleep 2/3 seats max."
396205,2595154,1,Reneviajera,01/03/2023,"Impossible to get there or park nearby. I don't even think it can be reached by 4x4. Rocks, sand and very narrow place. If you want to visit it on foot, it is beautiful, a very beautiful small isolated cove."
396228,3211938,3,AnnaCastane,24/08/2023,"We spent one night with the van, the place is good and it's free but on summer nights there are bottles in the park. You can also find parking on that same street in quieter areas. During the day everything was fine."
396238,3264094,3,GuVionTour,06/09/2023,Ok for one night but I didn't feel comfortable. A lot of trash.
396238,2696455,4,CaddyHilde,25/04/2023,"Spent a relatively quiet night in this parking lot. However, you are less conspicuous with a caddy. But you can really recommend it. Quick walk to the beach and everything else nearby. Toilets at Mc.....or Burger...."
396238,2572551,3,Gyurci,09/02/2023,"It's a normal parking lot, it's full of dog poo because many of those who live around it take their dogs for walks. Of course, there is always room even if there are many cars. At night it is usually quiet."
396248,2587020,4,dam03,22/02/2023,"Be careful, the coin mechanism only takes 5 and 10th notes and the machines only take 1€ coins. For large vehicles possibility of this parked in the avenue next to 300m"
396248,2586778,5,eric3347,22/02/2023,"practical there is a café terrace just opposite, while waiting for the cycle to be completed... post office also next door. well suited for compact motorhomes. Provide 1€ coins. there is a coin acceptor who takes the notes. so no credit card."
396255,3019891,1,Charly255,25/07/2023,"Be careful, they broke a window and tried to enter through the door, there are a lot of gorilla in Loro Parque, I do not recommend it, the neighbors rebuke you"
396261,3293474,5,Sorginbidaiaria,13/09/2023,next to the station. no services at the moment. but soon there will be water and electricity services in all the plots... totally flat and very quiet... for now it is free
396261,3263303,5,DavidMh,06/09/2023,"New area in a privileged place, we were there last week of August and at the end of the night it was packed but super good. The parking areas are very large and you can even take out a table and chairs. The super pretty town. If the area is full there is a parking lot next door where you can also park and they don't say anything. You enter through the hotel entrance and turn right until the end."
396261,3246847,4,mjtaylor66,01/09/2023,"No seevices as yet - 30 August 23

That ssaid what a location, next to the refurbished hotel and next to the international station

Small town with everything you need, we had breakfast in one of the cafes and the people were so friendly 

Hopefully the services will be functioning soon"
396261,3243139,5,CesarFG,31/08/2023,"It is very well located, after the station. Leveled and with water, drainage and electricity but they are not yet in service."
396261,3236305,4,MELU86,29/08/2023,"Area under construction, almost flat, on bitumen. very calm, in bag culture after having passed the magnificent qare of Canfranc. 10 minutes from the city. The services are not yet operational. free currently"
396261,3234308,4,gassin54,29/08/2023,"Not far from the city centre, calm, grandiose site, the area is not finished but it has great promise."
396261,3231447,4,casacruz,28/08/2023,Thanks to the municipality for giving us the opportunity to enjoy this beautiful and peaceful place. When the services are working it will be a place 10.
396261,3215013,4,PrzemyslawJ,25/08/2023,"parking ok, temporary no service"
396261,3213449,4,Pacovan,24/08/2023,"The area and the station are fantastic, for those of us who have known it for years. In the afternoon it fills up and the parking lot next door too but you will surely find a place"
396261,3203197,4,RUMOJOIA,23/08/2023,Very good and quiet despite not having services for the time being and very well located and access by a small trail to the river and the city center!
396261,3197688,3,Lourie47,22/08/2023,"Flat, spacious parking. Easy access. Too bad that the area is lit by streetlights all night long because on hot nights it is impossible to sleep with the windows open because of the insects attracted by the light. Average setting because near an old train station (rusty and tagged wagon, abandoned buildings, work grid….)… maybe once finished?!"
396261,3196185,3,camidalella,21/08/2023,Full area. Parking in adjacent area for cars. Services are still not working.
396261,3192576,4,gejuma,21/08/2023,Spacious and with a beautiful setting. When the services work it will be perfect
396261,3172978,3,vantour61,18/08/2023,"New and clean free area. Very silent night. We have seen that the municipality is completing the work to give this area loading, unloading and electricity. When the services are completed they will deserve 5 stars!"
396261,3170496,4,SergioLerin,17/08/2023,"Very well located next to the station and hotel of the Canfranc Station. Perfect for starting excursions. The services are still not working. If you want to avoid turning around to cross the bridge that connects to Canfranc-estación, there is a path that starts on the west side of the area, which goes down and ends at a bridge over the river that allows you to quickly access the southern part of the town"
396261,3169844,4,levichi,17/08/2023,"It is unfinished. Missing water and being able to evacuate. For the rest, easy access and wide spaces. August 17 has been filled."
396261,3169597,3,Pedro1951mayo,17/08/2023,"Indeed paved, flat, after the old station in the direction of Jaca. They are currently out of service, the water load, and the emptying of gray and black water, the facilities are there but a sign warns you."
396261,3162103,3,hmachuka,16/08/2023,"Good area. Very well located. The water was not working. It was full and we spent the night in the parking lot next door, a little narrower."
396261,3155210,3,emmadavid,15/08/2023,The places are spacious but fill up quickly. Advertised services do not work. The place is beautiful.
396261,3151614,4,AlexValero,15/08/2023,"New motorhome area, but no fill/empty services or electricity yet as it doesn't work. There is no signage from the road, otherwise I would give it a 5, monitored with cameras and ample parking spaces."
396261,3150042,5,Raut,15/08/2023,"Very quiet, great and with enough places. Close to town, restaurants, etc. Also 5 min walk and for 2.50 eur you can take a bath in the municipal pool."
396261,3139132,5,Parri82,13/08/2023,Congratulations to the city council for this area. A spectacular and well-kept site. When all services work it will be 10.
396261,3137911,4,Rondalla,13/08/2023,"very good area, the services just need to work. I slept very peacefully."
396261,3137591,4,ABC999,13/08/2023,"Great area, very quiet, in a very nice area. Services do not work. If there is no room there, before there is a parking lot that allows you to spend the night, next to the river. At the beginning there is another parking lot but it says that it is not possible at night."
396261,3117656,4,tiagofialho,10/08/2023,"Clean, well-cared and in a spectacular setting! Very close to the station, everything super new, so new that the services still don't work (neither electricity nor water nor draining of blacks) a park for children and pets next door. wide but insufficient places. to thank the city council for creating such a space, to continue taking care of it among all !!"
396261,3104341,3,withourhymer,08/08/2023,Nice and well located place. But the AC services were not working.
396261,3097602,4,berzagalega,07/08/2023,"Large but insufficient places. Motorhomes are prohibited from parking in other places and then the exclusive areas fill up with little vans camping. These should be in the car spaces, very little consideration."
396261,3091329,4,Powergs800f,06/08/2023,"It is accessed through the entrance to the hotel on the right, crossing the bridge. There is another area just before reaching this one, about 25 meters away. The main one has parking lots for large AC but they park campers and the site is wasted. in the other area, the sites with shorter. The ideal is to occupy the smaller ones if your vehicle is smaller."
396261,3065186,4,Chasishome,02/08/2023,Good area that the city council is enabling. Very quiet to spend the night. The water loading service is still missing. Be careful to respect the delimitation regulations in the adjacent parking spaces as the authorities penalize if the marked lines are exceeded.
396261,3046122,4,pec66,30/07/2023,Beautiful aire in a wonderful setting. The fifth star when the services are available. The access road does not appear on the GPS
396261,3043899,5,genviajerospain,30/07/2023,"Although services are still lacking, a round of applause for the municipality for this place next to the old station. We were there 3 years ago and it was under construction, now green areas and ideal for spending the night and walking. The area was full, but there are parking lots right next to it where we could stay without problem. Always respect in these places, we are many."
396261,3038979,5,Oscarysandra,29/07/2023,"We have spent the night here, very quiet, the area has no services yet but it is highly recommended. It can be accessed right through the hotel entrance, on the right all the way to the end. The Maps does not indicate it well."
396261,3037934,3,SMC1957,29/07/2023,"I put only 3 * because it has been finished for months and the services still do not work. Full last night, with 17 here plus in adjacent car parking. I prefer to pay something for services and avoid fires that shower with soap outside, etc."
396261,3027214,4,coletademelilla,27/07/2023,"Good free area, without any type of service at the moment because they are on but do not work, a quiet place, it is difficult to find since the services are not operational, there are no signs of indicators to get there, it fills up quickly"
396261,3024039,5,Fredyzaragoza,26/07/2023,"Excellent PARKING for the moment. You can NOT use the emptying of blacks and drinking water. Some pay no attention and empty the WC, without rinsing with water so, thanks to those rude people, they will close the parking lot until the service point opens."
396261,3012936,4,anfravi,24/07/2023,"good area, as soon as they provide it with services, they will charge us."

396261,3007106,5,bea_hu,23/07/2023,"Free area. in July 2023 services out of operation (water intake, gray water, electricity) there are containers."
396261,3003822,2,dede18zgz,22/07/2023,good for one night. but too many people pass. too much traffic of both pedestrians and cars. no services.
396261,3001765,4,carlosfolk,22/07/2023,"Quiet place, with great views. It does not yet have the operational black/grey water and water services. This is why we don't give it a 5. Access is the same as the hotel... to the right and at the bottom. There is plenty of parking to park next to the specific area for motorhomes"
396261,3000605,5,lebataillou,22/07/2023,"Great stop, very quiet and spacious. No shims needed. The river the softwoods the mountain and a bit of freshness. A superb corner, no electricity yet but the landscape is magnificent"
396261,2993227,4,angeleslo,20/07/2023,"The site is very well located, yes wonderful environment. Access is through the industrial area. Pir behind Felipe street. It is close to the hotel. The services did not work and the tourist office did not know the date."
396261,2987089,3,eduardo.navarro,19/07/2023,The site is fine; but nothing works. The water and emptying of gray and black is not operational.
396261,2980063,5,zairarc,17/07/2023,"Very nice place. Under the mountains next to the future train museum and 3 min from Canfranc station. Hiking trails, municipal swimming pools. The guided tour, a Sargantan company, is recommended. google error, Arrive at the end of the town and pass the Caravinieros booth and then to the right downhill, it is not the first parking lot but pass in front of it and continue until the end."
396261,2975366,1,miticoarpege,16/07/2023,"one star no more. those who manage a parking area cannot leave it without services in the high season. also works in progress with noise until late in the evening, even on Sundays"
396261,2970131,5,crispe2000,16/07/2023,"excellent area, although the services still do not work. Very good views and a park with two slides. attached to the big station. Very cool routes that leave from the same place. bars and shops, playground, pharmacy, shops... border with France right there"
396261,2968521,5,Javierrodilla,15/07/2023,"No amenities yet, but it's a great location. This weekend is somewhat noisy due to the town's drl festivities."

396261,2953843,5,sevenseven1,12/07/2023,Nicely furnished.
396261,2933567,2,beatrulla,07/07/2023,"I give the two stars for the view of the mountains and the location to the center. Otherwise, the immediate area is rather ugly (there are construction machines) and dirt (forest seems to be used as a toilet, toilet paper everywhere and so). Directions: to the very end of the village, only then turn right, straight ahead at the roundabout and drive to the end (behind the playground)."
396261,2933215,4,Nuevosmun2,07/07/2023,Very spacious and with very nice views. Not to be confused with the parking lot in the middle of the straight. You have to go to the end of the road. It does not have active services yet.
396261,2928438,4,johnandjan,06/07/2023,Can only repeat other comments will be 5star once complete and difficult to find . As you enter town turn over bridge as if driving straight into estación hotel then go right again with hotel on left
396261,2925833,5,VicenteMaestre,05/07/2023,Exceptional place... there are no services... it's prepared... it would be a settlement... worth seeing
396261,2919959,4,barba1,03/07/2023,At the moment 4* but I admit that the place is spectacular and the area is great. When it has light and water it will be perfect. Thank you very much to the town hall.
396261,2919295,4,garrondo,03/07/2023,"It is also important to emphasize that in the rest of the town the municipal ordinance indicates that parking motorhomes is prohibited. At least that was what some council billboards located in the parking lot at the other end of the station indicated. When they open it completely, it will be unbeatable both for the views and for the railway theme. There is also a children's playground right next door."
396261,2915856,4,aranxa16,02/07/2023,"Good area but no services yet. There are no directions to get there. You have to go to the end of the town, at the crossroads turn right and drive behind the station along the road until you reach the end. It's all new area."
396261,2913642,4,_LaCaracola_,02/07/2023,"Incredible place but it has been without services since it was officially opened in January, many people use the drains even without having water to clean... A pity, let's hope that the town hall can start up the water and electricity as soon as possible."
396261,2905603,4,utopiafotografia,29/06/2023,"Good location, still without services since it is not finished yet, to enter, you must go to the station and cross the bridge and turn right and down and you can see the area, Google Maps and this application give the location wrong, it will get 5 stars when finished."
396261,2896081,3,fafajojo,26/06/2023,"Hello everyone it was said free but what should I pay because there is nothing that works there is no water there electricity to see the sheaths which are at the entrance it would surprise me if it remains free for me there will be barriers anyway, let it be said."
396261,2888091,4,Salocin,24/06/2023,"Great area, very quiet and in a very good area, but the services still do not work."
396261,2862197,5,Greygappers,17/06/2023,"Spain. Unparalleled views, perfectly flat parking will make it 5• when fully active. To enter the Aire from the south you must continue through the town and you will come to a sign for Canfranc Station then drive past the entrance to the hotel to the end of the site. Google maps does not have the new roads yet."
396261,2860862,3,albertto207,16/06/2023,"Very quiet area and in a very good area but the services still do not work, a shame..."
396261,2760606,3,dragonqueen,18/05/2023,"The place is not signposted and the services are still out of order. Drive past the train station from Jaca and turn right before you get to the tunnel. If you drive back at the dreamlike station building, the square is at the very end. The two of us spent a quiet but cold night. The further drive over the Somport Pass to France is very nice, better than the tunnel"
396261,2749106,4,janbal,14/05/2023,"Spectacular views of mountains, old carriages, the train station. Very clean. However, Google does not find it using these coordinates. The entrance is only after the Estación in the direction of the pass after the first right turn. There you have to turn right down to the Estación and left straight ahead until after the playground."
396261,2745248,5,SMC1957,13/05/2023,"Although the services are not yet open, the area allows you to spend a night in absolute tranquility, in addition to visiting the Station and shops in the town. Thanks for this space. It is located to the right of the main building as seen from the front, in the background, not where the GPS apps indicate."
396261,2732688,4,PatNita,08/05/2023,"Parking for motorhomes whose services seem to be being installed. Very quiet location, in the center of Canfran, close to hiking trails but also to landscaped gardens that will appeal to the whole family. Another car park is also at the other end. We will be back!"
396261,2726141,4,walkernomada,05/05/2023,"Quiet place right next to Canfranc Station. Nice views There are no services for AutoC, it is not an area, more like a parking lot. there are hiking trails from parking. the tourist office is nearby. Once you have passed the station on your right, continue to the bottom to the right, take a detour and it will take you to the parking lot. also for large AutoC,s."
396261,2717460,4,Canarios,02/05/2023,"This area, the entrance is a bit complicated, you have to leave the town towards France km 668 N- 330a, exit to the right Canfranc 1"
396261,2712242,4,Vinie31,01/05/2023,"Very quiet night. To get there: cross the town and follow the new route after the station (GPS point 42.7472249, -0.5143102). Nuit tres calme. Pour y arriver, traverser le village et suivre la nouvelle route après la gare. (Point GPS 42.7472249, -0.5143102)."
396261,2705607,3,PierreDebras,29/04/2023,"The services are not yet available. Nice quiet location close to the famous Canfranc train station. Looks more like a parking lot. Go down towards the industrial zone after the station, go back in front of the station. Go all the way to the bottom."
396261,2670240,1,rondepon,14/04/2023,closed off with fences because people still use facilities that are not yet ready. (4/14/2023)
396261,2665217,2,inaki10,12/04/2023,Services do not work yet but still and everything and ignoring the signs people empty sewage. Then what happens to us happens to us...

We're Marc & Marta, living and travelling Europe full time in our campervan Meri since  1 year ago."
396261,2663103,5,matpete,11/04/2023,"Great area for a night stop. 6 other motorhomes on a Tuesday night. Quiet and feeling secure. Big spaces. To access it, go to the end of the town and turn right following “zona industrial”, pass in front of the Estacion hotel, it is at the end of the road. Alternatively, enter via the fancy Estacion hotel, then go right."
396261,2662498,5,whitmad,11/04/2023,"Beautiful location, peaceful, with wonderful views. The mix of regenerated and decaying infrastructure has a charm that will no doubt vanish in time. Services still not complete, but forewarned that was not a problem for us"
396261,2660188,3,noel1985,10/04/2023,"Area still under construction but with a very good location. The services are still not working and there is a sign that says PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICES. But in 1 hour I have seen two empty black and gray motorhomes, if they close it later on, don't complain!"
396261,2660132,4,oriolrue,10/04/2023,"Beautiful area, quiet and unbeatable location. The services still do not work, a pity because it would already be very very top !!!!"
396261,2658408,4,jisjis,10/04/2023,"Area in a privileged place. Wide spaces. As of 8/4/2023 the services do not work. Attention: do not enter the bridge at the main entrance to the station, it is prohibited. At the end of the town on the right is the entrance."
396261,2655064,4,pabibadel,09/04/2023,"Well appointed place, services are not yet available, well placed. only drawback in this very long Easter weekend in Spain: the places are packed and are occupied several days in a row. Too bad the police don't want to ask for a rotation. In addition, some places are taken by small vehicles (mini-van type or small utility station wagon)."
396261,2652876,5,jeabc,09/04/2023,Fantastic place to spend the night
396261,2652060,5,sandmarcamper,09/04/2023,"We only stopped for the night, a very quiet night!"
396261,2628831,5,Summit599,29/03/2023,Top clean pitch. Many thanks to the community. From here there are beautiful hiking trails. The space will not be expanded. VE is here.
396261,2624969,5,rimor64,26/03/2023,"thank you and congratulations for this area not yet finished but quiet which allows you to enjoy the landscape and visit canfranc possibility of having water at the repsol station a few km further after refueling, friendly staff"
396261,2623548,5,david10,25/03/2023,"Very quiet place next to the station, the services still do not work. Good place to stop and see the old train station."
396261,2623191,4,soapyf,25/03/2023,Still not fully working 25th March. Built on the site of the old railway station this is a great place for rail enthusiasts. Will be using for future journeys. Big thank you to the local community and recommend.
396261,2618375,4,Chechu2020,21/03/2023,"We stayed one night and everything was fine, the site is fairly level, no vehicles pass by and it is very quiet. It is true that we did not have to use the services, so I do not know if they are already working. To access it, you have to enter from the bridge that gives access to the Train Station Hotel."
396261,2611429,1,camperman67,16/03/2023,out of order everything
396261,2607133,5,Carwal,12/03/2023,"There are three marked areas to park motorhomes. But the one at the end is where the loading and unloading area and the light poles are. As of 03/12/2023, gray and black can be unloaded, but both the faucets to load and clean black as well as the light poles do not work. The area is beautiful to be surrounded by mountains, the beautiful station and it has a green area with a park for children."
396261,2598366,4,Fernandotkd,04/03/2023,"As the description says, it is an area that is not yet 100% complete, but I foresee a spectacular future for it."
396261,2593808,4,NanoCatSammy,28/02/2023,"New, flat concrete area, no services yet but good 4g. Google Maps does not take you there but another app will get you to the right location. If you use Google maps (coming from France) do not turn right into the small side road, keep going past the big Canfranc Estación, a Royal Hideaway Hotel, follow the road around that will take you behind the hotel."
396261,2586086,5,Juven,21/02/2023,A place with infinite possibilities. The correct entrance (on the bridge in front of the hotel there is a sign forbidding driving) is taking the detour at the exit of the town in the direction of France. The area is on the other side of the hotel.
396261,2584036,3,karpets,20/02/2023,"Today it is only enabled for parking, it has no services. Only emptying of grays. You have to pass in front of the station because the GPS does not indicate it very well."
396261,2583102,4,PolarJbl,19/02/2023,"Good place to be or spend the night. It is still unfinished but can be used. To access, cross the bridge of the Station/Gran Hotel with the vehicle and turn right, the location gives me somewhere else."
396261,2577919,4,robell,14/02/2023,"As the saying goes “it will be great when it’s finished”. At this time it is just a flat car park with the facilities newly laid in, but at least it is specific for motorhomes. Stayed here for one night.   Note, if your sat nav tries to take you up a silly little road to the right of the main road then ignore it. The correct route to get here is from the front of  the main Estacion Hotel itself."
396261,2574939,4,Carlosb1,11/02/2023,Area that promises a lot when fully operational. We spent two very quiet nights.
396270,2586604,5,asterixy,22/02/2023,Good service. 30.-€/motorhome
396284,2634389,1,Martapampin,01/04/2023,full of lass fooling around skidding and open trunks of drinks. no kidding stay there
396293,2587891,5,matteokn,23/02/2023,Hot water and great water pressure. Top!
396293,2572996,5,jeanlaventurier,09/02/2023,"Sanitary (wc and shower) very clean, with access to hot water. For a very affordable price."
396333,2826700,1,Vanside_Story,06/06/2023,Disaster this pitch. Entire way littered with car tires etc. Driveway really difficult to drive due to huge potholes and washboard surface. And that with Transit. Think twice about driving there with a normal WoMo.
396333,2739741,3,Kartoffelsuppe,10/05/2023,"A lot of mosquitoes and rubbish. Might be a nice square but the surroundings are kinda weird. Many storks (very shy, so please behave as inconspicuously and quietly as possible) and direct access to the river. Due to the dirty water, however, not necessarily a bathing option. Large barges and ferries pass by several times a day and night."
396333,2610569,4,df4tw,15/03/2023,"Nice place when dry. Absolutely quiet at night. The clattering of the storks wakes us up in the morning. Pure nature. A lot of rubbish, we picked up a sack. Now and then a big ship. The strong swell destroys the banks."
396333,2592684,4,YolandaBenitez,27/02/2023,"Great place, quiet night in nature. Some rubbish (a pity). But taking a walk you can pick up a bit of it, since there are garbage cans. Very good experience"
396334,2998299,1,laksmistravels,21/07/2023,"We slept one night here and felt good but then our back window was broken into today, middle of day, despite the number of people passing by. Luckily nothing was taken as nothing was in reach."
396334,2879993,4,MRG10,22/06/2023,"Near the beach. Good as a place of passage, for one night and that's it. In the morning, quite a few cars pass by on the road. You can have breakfast at the Hotel Sitges free buffet for €11, very good and very friendly. At this time the showers on the beach are not working due to drought restrictions."
396340,2620311,3,Lebensglück,22/03/2023,"simple gravel place, ok for overnight stays"
396340,2597309,4,giulia96,03/03/2023,"Nothing special, but given all the bans in the region, it's just fine. Large dirt parking, suitable for all campers, quiet at night. We try to be discreet!"

396353,2577386,4,Perle07,14/02/2023,"Airplanes can be heard and seen during the day, depending on the wind direction, but it's quiet at night A quiet night is spent. Garbage cans, shops, bars and pubs as well as the beach promenade are within easy walking distance."
396363,2598421,5,matteokn,04/03/2023,Beautiful view. Should also be possible with a normal mobile home. Normal mobile phone reception (5G)
396363,2597774,3,Nufke,04/03/2023,"After we picked up a garbage bag full of junk and threw it in the garbage can 10 meters away, we had a very nice evening and night with a super view! Bit of a tight road to get there."

396378,2585747,5,blancaribas,21/02/2023,"The faucet is one of those that you have to keep pressing all the time, and the jet does not come out very strongly, but we have been able to fill the entire tank, which is what matters :)"

396392,3238260,4,CecileChom,30/08/2023,"Location as surprising as it is stressful (old, empty and partly destroyed building). Very quiet, numerous pitches. Access ok by van. A good experience"
396392,3137274,5,elrefugio106,13/08/2023,"It is normal that when you arrive at night you are a little scared, but the path is safe and it is very worthwhile to climb to the top. We have been alone, very quiet and the stars are spectacular."
396392,3115484,5,lesRiris,10/08/2023,"Warning: do not use Waze but another browser like Google map for example, at the risk of not finding the access and going through the paid highway. We ended up finding it after three searches. And it's incredibly worth it. Just amazing spot! We preferred to put ourselves on the other side of the beats, to avoid nocturnal visits. It was magical !!!!!!!!!"
396392,2873462,3,ropey,20/06/2023,There appear to be rocks narrowing the road entrance and it is quite a rough track. We decided against taking our 6m Hymer up there. Shame as it sounds great.
396392,2669578,4,LemonSlice,14/04/2023,Very nice spot quite incredible!
396392,2635308,5,Joannamjj,02/04/2023,Amazing spot. Old mineral mine is a great place to visit and explore. We’ve been there few quiet nights.
396392,2623332,5,LuciaCorroto,25/03/2023,"Extraordinary, what peace! At night it is calm and you can see all the stars, ideal to spend the night"
396392,2612434,5,annie.paleni,17/03/2023,Must see! Beautiful beautiful place. Could wander around all day long and it wouldn’t be enough. Make sure to come by the road from Mazarrón. The access from the side where the highway is is blocked. Be also careful where to park as the ground can flunk at some places. Best to park next to the buildings.
396392,2602104,5,catharinski,07/03/2023,Stunning place in the middle of the old mines. Perfect for hiking and exploring during the day. At night it is very quiet and has something mystical about it. Access is via a gravel road. It wasn't a problem with our Sprinter without all-wheel drive.
396392,2597339,5,finniundjuliontour,03/03/2023,"Really cool location to spend one, two or three nights. Police drove by and stopped but said nothing. Access a bit bumpy but also feasible without 4x4 and 7m"
396392,2577907,5,arek60,14/02/2023,"the area of an abandoned mine, the views are amazing, I do not recommend entering when it is raining, a quiet and peaceful place, for a large motorhome without a 4x4 it is ok"
396392,2573963,5,DzikiMaciek,10/02/2023,A beautiful place for a day of sightseeing. We stayed overnight between old buildings. Amazing rock colors!
396442,2944906,5,Nathalina,10/07/2023,"18kg 7€, 14kg 6€ etc 10min. dry 1€. super cheap, absolutely recommended. Even with 3 euros the motorhome is washed"
396442,2580055,2,laura2529,16/02/2023,"Clothes came out covered in marks - not sure why, assume something that had been put in the machine previously. Used 18kg washing machine (€7) & dryer (50mins for €5). Detergent included. No change machine in the laundrette itself - machines take coins only. Space to park outside. Change machine at the car wash wasn’t working. Gate closes about 9pm - you can exit but can’t enter after this time."

396448,2579509,5,lbokel,16/02/2023,Works flawlessly. Cool water very good pressure. You can park right in front of it and fill up with water in peace. There are rubbish bins opposite. The place is perfect.

396498,2819947,2,catmovil,04/06/2023,"The idea is good (lots of places and well leveled) but they should think about what happens when it snows or rains. As you can see in the photos, it becomes a mud that is not easy to get out of"
396498,2613376,4,selmar89,18/03/2023,Spacious and without services! Gravel would be great because it was pretty muddy
396498,2579631,4,Ernes98,16/02/2023,"Exclusive motorhomes, a ski resort that instead of simply prohibiting our stay or visit, creates a new space for us. Despite being a simple open field, they have enabled it with some gravel on the slope so as not to skid when going up, and it is quite flat, if it rains... like any natural site on land, it is a mudhole. I only visit these ski slopes now. Thank you."

It's pretty much just a gravel place to park the van.

Hosts are super nice and have us some eggs but they should take power off the camping site information."

The environment is spectacular, nature in its purest form, with views of an extensive marsh in which to disconnect, and connect with nature. Wishing to return to this haven of peace. 100% recommendable"
396534,2652958,5,Miguel_Angel,09/04/2023,"It is a spectacular place, quiet and surrounded by nature. The owners are very attentive and friendly, willing to give you information about the place so that you can enjoy it in its entirety. I have spent all Easter there and I will repeat without a doubt this summer."
396534,2646397,5,Oriacheco,07/04/2023,"A spectacular place. It is the 3rd time that we come and we will repeat without a doubt. Because of how welcoming and hospitable the owners are (candela and Jos). The environment is beautiful, located in a protected natural area with views of the marsh and with the possibility of spotting all kinds of birds; flamingos, owls, cormorants, seagulls... although it requires your time and depends on the season of the year. Thank you"
396534,2636055,1,ADAVID72,02/04/2023,"I am not satisfied at all. I came to this place because the long description written by the owner seemed rewarding. But he was careful not to display the price of €10 without service. The location is cobbled together in the dust near an RV wreck. Neither sea, nor pink flamingos on the horizon but mosquitoes. The dogs were very nice but they barked all night"
396534,2632398,5,AplusB,31/03/2023,"Make sure to approach from town, not from above. We followed Waze and had zu turn around because it was not possible to go that way with the Camping mobile."
396534,2611336,5,janner,16/03/2023,Jos and Candela were great hosts very attentive and even brought us home made tapas as a welcome !! They have a wonderful site very peaceful and safe with great views over the Marismas. This site will only improve as the couple expand the business. Whilst there you can watch the great bird life - eagle owls /common wax bill / hoopoe/ Osprey and others.  There is also a great cycle track into the town of Ayemonte.  We wish then the best of luck and hope to return.

396542,2928400,5,TielleDias,06/07/2023,"Great. Very peaceful. We got a spot by luck, passing by, as we had a 7.4m motorhome, but it fit well. We spent the whole afternoon on the beach and decided to spend the night. Quiet night, there is no indication that you cannot stay overnight. Nobody bothered us. As always, we kept a low profile, made no noise."

396605,2676596,4,Andreas.Link,17/04/2023,... very nice quiet parking space near the city and far from the beach would estimate about 10 minutes walk to the city beach... directly at the parking lot there is also a large beach that doesn't look so nice. It is designated as resinto ferial which means fairgrounds in German. I can't say whether trade fairs are still taking place here.
396605,2669378,4,vlastovka,14/04/2023,"Good parking, close to shops, restaurants and seaside. Please don't have camping behavior. No grill, no roof awning, if you want camping, it's fine, but not here. Respect others, you are visitors not residents. Thanks. Have a good time."

Unfortunately, you can also see here how tables and chairs are set up or the mobile homes are washed. So it's probably only a matter of time before this place disappears."

396605,2647869,5,javyalonso,07/04/2023,"Esplanade of the fairground of Puerto de Mazarrón. You are 100 meters from the beach, wonderful for accessibility and surroundings. The removal of the awning, tables, chairs of some (especially foreigners) is not right, we know that it is prohibited and the only thing that is achieved is that these places are taken away from us. I RESPECT. It's just parking, with no services nearby, you have to go to the camper area or similar."

It is next to a vehicle depot and the views are not very attractive, which is why I don't give it 5 stars. It is worth 1 euro if you have the camping-car park card, with electricity, water and drainage. You can get the card at a machine right next to it. Entry for 5 euros is very easy and in 2 minutes."

396706,2689681,4,Marie-LouiseSchonning,23/04/2023,"A very good place to spend the night. Free! Spanish-speaking gatekeeper who notes the rain number and makes sure that you don't stay more than 48 hours. Of course you hear noise from the road and it certainly feels like the entire apartment complex on the side is against this parking space, but now the municipality is offering this and we appreciate that. Easy walk into the center."
396706,2686199,5,mmaarreekk,21/04/2023,"Amazing that this is for free. It is clean and all services top. The caretakers are very polite and helpful. It has called my attention that the apartment block next to the caravan park has signs up against this park. So please, don't break any rules and give them a reason to shut it down. The nights were quiet. I stayed the max time which was 2 nights. Thanx people of Lorca!! Loved your town!"

Convenient for visiting the center on foot. The only flaw, apart from not being beautiful (but being free we don't complain) is the organization. There are about 10 seats, when you arrive you have to call the municipality, so it's impossible at night. And if full, you risk having to leave. For the rest 5 stars."
396706,2661931,5,ourvanadventuresuk,11/04/2023,"Fantastic parking facilities, can’t believe it is free! You can only stay 48hrs and there is a lady that visits a few times a day and notes down number plates.  Very well located for the town centre.  We stayed just before Easter and it was getting busy, lots of double parking and shouting/aggression from people trying to park in a full car park!"

Culturally asked to leave before 14:00. The place is good! Thanks for the opportunity to stay overnight.

There is also a hose to the water tank and free wifi. Only to recommend.
397043,2915380,5,mayonoes,02/07/2023,"A pleasant location where you can go for a night. We were the only guests in Fernando's yard. We called last minute and it was still possible despite it being early in the evening. The plumbing was good (festival toilets / shower, he gave us his WiFi and there was a possibility of electricity. The place was a bit hidden and you can get in with a small camper. Had a great experience!"
397043,2875773,5,filinemo,20/06/2023,"Great pitch! Fernando is a very warm and helpful host. He chilled drinks for us before we arrived and also helped us to solve a problem with our camper. Shower and toilet are available and work great. We could also use WiFi and electricity. We are really excited, absolutely recommendable!"
397043,2829675,5,meretkl,07/06/2023,Super nice host! There is a kind of festival car as sanitary facilities only for the guests. Fernando offered us stuff from his fridge and we felt very safe. Good connections to Barcelona by car!
397043,2739968,5,Chris3,10/05/2023,"Very nice place. You can hear the street a bit, but for the low price that's ok. The host is very nice and was easy to reach by phone. The showers are hot. Clear recommendation and a real insider tip"
397043,2676200,5,f.dux905,17/04/2023,"After having confirmed beforehand that Fernando could receive us for one night via WhatsApp, very warm welcome (Fernando speaks French well :-)), quiet corner, “rustic” but very correct sanitary facilities. €10 per adult, €7 per child over 8 years old. I recommend !"
397043,2675593,5,roblaurajames,16/04/2023,Fernando was welcoming and took time to speak to us and played football with our son. There were clean warm showers and flat pitches. 10€ per night per person (didn’t charge for our son 6 years old). An excellent base for the Montserrat peaks and a visit to Barcelona. We parked at Martorell station (8 mins drive) for free and caught a train into Barcelona centre.
397043,2631058,5,jpat14,30/03/2023,Great spot! Very quiet and clean!
397043,2608499,4,Karik,13/03/2023,"Secluded spot yet close to the highway. We were in the middle of the village, 'lost': Fernando picked us up! super nice!! NB! Access road narrow and with tight bends. 6 meters really seems like the maximum to us, as the text also says!"
397043,2606689,5,moesie1986,12/03/2023,We stayed one night and called before we arrived. Showers and toilet are clean and good. It is a very serene environment and we slept very well. At night you can encounter wild boars. Super nice that we were allowed to stand here on land.
397043,2602776,5,poessltour,08/03/2023,"Email answer within 3h. Dirt road begins in curve with traffic, better enter coming from uphill.

Very fast WiFi. Perfect little container with toilets & hot showers. From the land you cannot see Montserrat but it's close. 12.50€ incl electricity. Good place, thank you Fernando.

In summer, it opens the canvases so that guests are protected from the sun. 2 km from the nearest village. Better to have a bike, scooter or vehicle to get around after putting the cc. Gas station very close. Supermarket at 10 '. Reservation required before going!"

397091,2905654,3,Bzn,29/06/2023,"Weekday night in the parking lot, ""quiet"" is not the word I would use given the incessant traffic of vehicles (including very noisy scooters) returning to the port area at night. Ditto in the morning, many cars came to park very early around us. Helps out for one night, on the other hand very well located for a stopover during the day to visit the city."
397091,2758711,5,ValerieMorice,18/05/2023,"very good location on opinion of other members. we spent the night there in a van and no noise. port parking open, free and unsecured but no problem allowing you to visit the city on foot (10-15 minutes on foot). I recommend"
397091,2603015,4,Marcella01,08/03/2023,"Great place. A lot of noise during the day, but very quiet at night. At 80 m a very good fish restaurant. Close to town and attractions. We stood here for 3 nights."

What a nice spacious camper place we have been here for 2 nights in a weekend, a police driving around in a normal car with a blue lamp gave a safe feeling! Of course local people left at night, which is completely normal for us in a port, but absolutely no nuisance, recommended!"
397091,2580783,4,ElRitchie,17/02/2023,"The place was quite good, we stayed three nights, without any problem, it is very close to the center by bike, close to public transport stations, bike track, there is no noise, highly recommended"

397092,2761883,5,FranziAimee,18/05/2023,"The water tastes okay and doesn't seem to be chlorinated or very little. Well suited to fill a canister. A hose could be hooked up by a water thief, but parking isn't ideal and the well is right between apartment buildings - it doesn't bode well for campers to hook up a hose here."
397092,2582015,5,binderdonethat,18/02/2023,Top! The description says everything.
397093,3115504,5,inarbd,10/08/2023,We spent a wonderful night between olive and orange trees in the middle of nature and were warmly welcomed by Sabine. The donkey was the highlight of our day and the cats and the dog make Sabine's little paradise a beautiful place. Thank you for all the nice conversations and dinner together! We felt very comfortable!
397093,2737888,1,hanslily,09/05/2023,"Sabine has a very welcome intro. Yesterday we arrived at her place, but unfortunately she was absent. We've been waiting for a while. Because no message was left, we had no idea if she was gone for a while or if she was gone for an extended period of time. It is useful to let potential guests know what to expect."
397093,2689810,4,freico,23/04/2023,Beautiful place. Very quiet and nice atmosphere. Large motorhomes will have difficulty entering the site. Sabine is busy making a beautiful paradise there.
397093,2671587,5,garkar,15/04/2023,"Wonderful tranquil night with Sabine. Our 6 mt van just fitted in. Highly recommend if you enjoy peaceful, natural and off grid locations.  The track is fine to drive but be careful if using Google maps as we were sent the wrong way."
397093,2616421,5,Braviaswan,19/03/2023,"A great experience in a beautiful place. People who love nature, the simple and essential are absolutely right here. Sabine is a person full of joie de vivre and warmth. She is the icing on the cake in this wonderful setting. Rosario her dog has become my sensitive friend. A place full of positive vibes where aggression doesn't stand a chance. 5 stars out of 5 from me. Wilf."
397093,2613162,5,chriman15,17/03/2023,It is an absolutely great place in the middle of olive and orange trees. The right place to unwind. Sabine the hostess is an absolutely great and dear heart person. I had a really good time on the Campo. And not to forget her absolutely lovely dog Rosalio.

397109,2750517,1,SilvioBondim,15/05/2023,"We were there in May/23. We didn't find any services. Earthy and irregular paving, with many puddles. I don't recommend staying overnight."
397109,2683174,2,KerryAnn,20/04/2023,"It's a good park up for one night, as it does seem a dumping ground and a bit sketchy in the evenings. 
Very close to the beach and walking distance to the centre though."
397109,2623236,5,msrtuki,25/03/2023,"The good: -Very close to the beach, just a zebra crossing. - Near the promenade that surrounds the coast with sources of drinking water. -quite large and flat, with access to motorhomes. The bad: - At the back of the car park there is a lot of garbage (I found cans, clinex, a vacuum cleaner...) - Being so close to the promenade there is movement from early morning"
397122,3224596,5,deveix33,27/08/2023,"Returned twice to this spot during our trip. The place is incredibly soothing: cliff, sea and sunset. We have never been dislodged, despite the fires in Odeceixe. On the other hand, the place is degraded by the garbage of visitors, we picked up with our garbage bags, great if everyone can do the same to make all the charm that this place offers!"
397122,3024149,1,mehariste66,26/07/2023,"wild camping is prohibited and fines are very very expensive, find a cheap campsite. or learn three Portuguese words, ask a farmer if you can sleep on his land! otherwise in the south there are thousands of exiled Europeans, more or less hippies, meet, ask! you will meet great people without the budget of your vacation going to a fine."
397122,2984085,5,nhogendoorn,18/07/2023,"Quiet place with beautiful view over the valley! Great way to get there, but doable (with a sturdy or smaller camper). No access to the beach, but a view if you walk a bit further. Really room for 2, Max 3 campers. We were with 2 campers, which was nice because it really feels like the middle of nowhere. Request residents: do not leave paper / waste behind!"

397122,2730583,1,catharinski,07/05/2023,"We wanted to spend the night here, unfortunately the place was already taken. So we drove on and wanted to stay the night there. Right after we turned off the engine, the headlights of the GNR, which followed us all the way, flashed on. He was very nice and said that we are not allowed to spend the night in the whole area and are not even allowed to drive through after 10 p.m. (nature park). He took our personal details, but we weren't fined."

To choose without hesitation."

If a rental vehicle is desired, this is also possible."

397297,2586219,5,FinnsAway,21/02/2023,We stayed one night and visited the brewery. The owners are very lovely people and have a camper attitude. There is a US army base next to the brewery so there are plenty of interning people every night! Beers are very good and quality products and at a very decent price level.

We drove a little further up the path from the indicated location to find a spot a little further from the road. We did wake up at 6 am with the spotlight of a (probable) police drone on us! Very strange! However, we were not followed when we drove to the port"

Space is just big enough to rank. you don't stand under trees, but you get their shade all around.

What was the highlight was the smell of the lemon groves as you walk from the site to the town. Just amazing. Views stunning and the hills incredible. Thank you town of Ricote.

397388,2596394,4,HeziPost,02/03/2023,It is a parking lot next to a sports building that is not actually in use. Large parking lot with all service facilities. 100 meters from a star restaurant and 300 meters from a supermarket. Small quiet village with several bars and restaurants. Beautiful environment. And after 20:00 completely silent. Occasionally a barking dog in the distance. But that's normal in Spain. Police come to do a round before dark. There are 2 large lamps that are lit. A perfect place for me. No power supply. Feel absolutely safe. Beautiful views of hills all around.
397388,2593405,4,rvanvugt,27/02/2023,"Clever! Simply adapt an existing parking area with water service, allow campers to park and you have an official camper-area! It is a basic parking, non tarmacked and thus bumpy/dusty. Barking dogs and ringing churchbells come with it. Lovely views, wonderful hiking possibilities, authentic bars and cafés. I spend 3 nights and really enjoyed the area, if just that dog was not there..."

397442,3050765,3,fabienPTS,31/07/2023,"Quiet place where it is easy to find a shade spot near the trees. We spent the night there and no passage, uncrowded so clean. Almost flat terrain depending on the location. For a getaway in the middle of nature in peace, the ideal. PS: not disturbed by the authorities, because far from the park and its outskirts."
397452,2737872,5,IvanLissnik,09/05/2023,Did a hike here to the Volcano and after we spent a night here in our van. Was a bit worried because it's inside a national park and I'm not sure if it's allowed to camp here also there were no other vans parked here but all good i guess.

Service for filling water and emptying gray and black. The worst: Threaded faucet only in the black WC forces you to fill the water through that faucet. Let's not be dirty. Today I picked up a can and a bottle from the ground. LET'S TAKE CARE OF IT Thanks to the town hall for this area.
397454,3086184,5,AnjaBeldman,06/08/2023,"Great place for a night. Indeed, they need to remove those middle spots. You can't leave when it's full (like last night). Very quiet and close to the center."
397454,3084309,1,txitxamari,05/08/2023,The squares are badly designed since the ones in the middle obstruct the exit of those that are on the wall. You can see that but the users plant it in the middle of you. Poorly raised and misused. A photo of it is attached. The only flaw.
397454,3023226,4,Huertanica,26/07/2023,We parked here to spend the night and visit Haro. It is for both motorhomes and home vehicles (in our case a van). It is clean and has a bar around the corner where you can have a coffee. There are also organic containers and all kinds of recycling. It is about a ten minute walk from the center of Haro. Perfect for parking and going to have some wine.

397454,2725194,4,E.M.A.A.,05/05/2023,"All free services (grey, black and clean water). It seems quite new, well paved although it does require a bit of shoeing. It has a barrier to enter, apparently it is under video surveillance. It has a tiny area of grass that makes up for so much asphalt. The squares of correct width, just enough to park in the lateral areas. In the central zone there are squares but I doubt that they can be used."

397693,3137236,1,Txinatarra,13/08/2023,"It is a street parking next to the beach. There is nothing and I don't think you can sleep there. Possibly outside of the summer period it is fine, not in August."
397693,2964881,3,farfufer,14/07/2023,quick and beautiful access to a cove with a beach bar. There are signs in Salou that parking motorhomes or vans is not allowed. the police simply warned us not to take anything out of the van and to leave in the morning. without shade and the air does not blow when being between houses
397693,2949009,4,Traf74,11/07/2023,"Spot very well placed to go to the beach and even enjoy a free shower. The view is beautiful. On the other hand, a lot of mosquitoes in the evening by the sea. Quiet night but it was very hot! Be careful, do not exceed 6m in length because it is in a small impasse and risks getting in the way."
397693,2889745,5,mmhhgg,25/06/2023,"Very quiet place and with access to the cove, the only drawback is that there are short spaces, for our 6-meter van it was a bit outside! Refrain longer motorhomes and do not make noise as it is a quiet residential area"
397693,2884371,4,40T5,23/06/2023,"We have just spent three days and two nights there, a super quiet place, convenient beach access with the shower at the top, just woken up in the morning by the gardeners, but who were very nice, the locals were very nice too."

397693,2769834,5,mewifeanddog,21/05/2023,"It is very quiet very close to the sea and without any noise or people walking next to the private parking lot and it feels very safe because there are not so many people around. It is between private urbanizations, there is no hotel either, so you have to be quiet and not make noise, well, people are tolerating it."
397703,2900567,3,kikiiara,28/06/2023,"okay for one night but since the place is right next to the road you can hear the passing cars quite loud. The road is not very busy, but cars pass by regularly."

397736,3274849,5,Ritaintransit,09/09/2023,The police recommended this as the place to park for free. It’s safe and fairly quiet despite being close to the road. Lots of other campers. Close to beach.
397736,2911212,4,merx1978,01/07/2023,"We parked there to get to know Cádiz, the place is right in front of the tram and suburban train station. I imagine that at night there will be a lot of noise due to the proximity to the road. On both sides, otherwise everything is fine."

397754,3274951,5,lennilukey,09/09/2023,"Jaumes is a very friendly and relaxed host. It was a 15min walk to the R1 Trainline which took us into Barcelona. The neighbourhood feels safe, there is just 2minutes of unlit laneway just before the property if you’re walking back at night. We had a very pleasant stay for 3 nights."
397754,3266411,5,angela1974,06/09/2023,"Best place for Barcelona. Very sure. 15 minutes walk to the train, which then takes about 30 minutes to the center of Barcelona, €19 family ticket there and back. 10 € a night, super relaxed hosts, we would come back at any time!"

Water is available (not for drinking), the owner is incredibly nice and helpful. In 45 minutes by train in Barcelona. 10min walk to the beach and train station. I will 100% come back if I go to Barcelona, absolute recommendation."

397754,3217369,5,Lotteontour221,25/08/2023,"Good pitch for campers with their own toilet. It takes about 30 minutes to get to Barcelona and a 25-minute walk to the beach, which is very nice. 10€/day. Rubbish can be disposed of and water (non-potable) is available. You can get drinking water on request, provided you have a canister. We stood there for 4 days and felt very safe. Ideal to explore Barcelona :)"
397754,3213950,4,aurecleaalec,25/08/2023,"Ideally located, James' land allows you to sleep in peace and to have on foot the tram station which connects Barcelona in 30 minutes, and the beach. The GPS stops a little before the entrance, it is good to stay on its right of course it is stuck to an equestrian center there are sometimes a little strong smells and flies, but it is totally viable. we spent two nights there."
397754,3213283,5,Schneiderek,24/08/2023,"Many thanks James for this great place! Currently there is only water. No disposal possible! James has a vision, since he is a camper himself, he wants to create a pitch where everyone feels comfortable. Showers V/E will follow. But Jams also needs the necessary small change for this, he invests every 10€ in the parking space. So community please visit James ! Thank you James"
397754,3210788,5,emmyrmr,24/08/2023,Good place to spend a night. Must be independent in WC and shower but no worries for us.

Spacious and quiet space, convenient for visiting Barcelona without leaving the camper unattended. Jaume made us park right away, very kindly, and pay the fee (€10 per night).

397754,3091334,5,sammyvandenberge,06/08/2023,"Beautiful quiet location, ideal for visiting the beach or taking the train to Barcelona. Drive along the coastline and follow the orange gauge once you leave the paved road."

To take a but, from the asphalt roundabout to the farm, the road has no lighting and we had to use mobile light. If you go alone at night you may feel unsafe. Being in an agricultural area there were not many flies/mosquitoes."

A quiet, secure and very peaceful place, very close to Barcelona (access by train 30 minutes away). Beach 15 minutes walk. All amenities nearby (bakery, supermarkets...) What I appreciated the most was James' personality and lifestyle. More over, a perfect place to spend time with family and focus on real things in life. Julie y Javier"

397754,2954761,5,Theyellowvan,12/07/2023,"Such a lovely stay! James (host) was super kind and helped us with all sorts of things, very charismatic and friendly person. We felt super safe on his land.It wasnt too busy (just 2-3 other people camping there) so we had lots of privacy. Also very quiet place with a wunderful romantic view on the skyline of vilissar."
397754,2927258,5,Woody4711,05/07/2023,"The place is just a meadow. Trust the GPS, the way is correct, but only from the sea side. Whoever comes from the mountains has lost. James is super nice and correct. We are traveling with three axles and eight meters, so you should know your mobility to get onto the pitch. James, the groundskeeper, made sure that the neighbors got us out. ALWAYS MY PLEASURE"
397754,2896157,5,Friedbert1234,26/06/2023,"We had a very nice stay, James was super nice and helpful, even a short-term overnight stay was no problem! The sea is within walking distance and the city is very nice for an evening trip. However, there are many mosquitoes, which is why an insect repellent is an advantage."
397754,2890822,5,BeauLunaEdvantures,25/06/2023,"Flat level field to stay in that is really safe and perfect for exploring Barcelona. The host was onsite a lot and incredibly friendly and helpful. Although there are no services here (other than garbage and non potable water) it warrants 5 stars for the host, James. Easy 10 minute walk to Vilassar for nice organic food shops and clothing boutiques, beach and perfect for train to Barcelona."
397754,2886687,5,y1,24/06/2023,"Great place, a bit outside Barcelona, quite and safe, for a very fair price. It‘s minimal, no services, except water/garbage, get in touch with Jaume/Estela, they are lovely, super kind and make you feel welcome. Vilassar is also pretty, nice beach, from laundry to organic store, shops, tapas bars etc. Ideal for daytrips to Barcelona, direct train to the city. They get my full recommendation."

397754,2822719,4,YasminRamaLee,05/06/2023,"This is a lovely spot with a kind and friendly family.  Unfortunately as I am a solo female vanner, this was a bit far from the city to walk at night from the bus stop/train station.  I would certainly park my van here and stay in the city for some nights.  Great for couples.

Do fill up your water in advance, as although there is water on site, it is not potable."
397754,2822215,2,skallte,05/06/2023,"While a quiet and safe place, we slept on animal droppings, so there were a lot of mosquitoes, and the area is extremely dirty and not worth it. Highly recommended for visiting Barcelona, but there are better options there too."

397754,2731882,5,Roer,07/05/2023,wonderful rural place to spend the night. you can reach Barcelona in no time by train. we have done well by bike also along the boulevard. when you arrive at the place you think ooh! fairly narrow and bumpy. But soon James arrived to guide us. very friendly man and his sister is also often present. if you need anything they are right there for you. Rob&Erica
397754,2719363,5,famillewozniak,03/05/2023,"Great welcome! James is extremely kind and caring. Contact him before your arrival, as it is difficult to find. But accessible with an 8m without worries.

397754,2685006,5,rowananna,21/04/2023,"Great and safe place to park up to visit Barcelona, train station within walking distance and regular trains into the city. We took our dog in with us, unsure if dogs need to be muzzled on trains but we bought a cheap (€4) muzzle from Kiwoko and had it in our bags, no one asked us to put it on her. Train was extremely busy both ways but regular and on time. Absolutely recommend parkup !"
397754,2675677,5,Dr.John,16/04/2023,"great for visiting Barcelona. 8 euro round trip by train with the bike. take the gate for people with reduced mobility and get on the train by the door with the same symbol. it is often indicated on the quay. bike just goes into the lift. or rent bikes on site. Our Chausson is 7m50, no access problem"
397754,2674730,5,johann79,16/04/2023,a big thank you to James and his sister for their great welcome. They make land available for 10 euro 40 minutes by train from Barcelona (station 10 minutes walk) it's clean and quiet! for this price it is a gift they give to travelers!!! thank you friends...
397754,2670098,4,SENTIER25,14/04/2023,4 stars for the price and friendliness of James. The only interest is the proximity to the train station to go to Barcelona. Otherwise large land without any service and a dozen vans and motorhomes.
397754,2668702,5,michmaart23,14/04/2023,Nice safe place in a beautiful village. easy to get to Barcelona from here. Nice people who do their very best for a good stay.
397754,2662540,5,Punait,11/04/2023,"Nice little parking space without supply. Right between vegetable plantations. The operator is super nice. I had damage to my vehicle and he gave me great support. Very pleasant and friendly atmosphere! The entrance is quite narrow. With 6m Fiat Ducato there was still a little room, but much more is tight. The entrance goes around a tight curve and then relatively steeply downhill."
397754,2655777,4,Franzenbaehr,09/04/2023,"We used it as a base to visit Barcelona, which was handy and safe for us. Jaume is really nice and helpful. Unfortunately it’s only a grass field right now but Jaume wants to build some upgrades like trees, garden shower etc. Would definitely come back."
397754,2631883,4,MoGeert2021,31/03/2023,"A pleasant meadow 15 minutes walk from the sea and the train station to Barcelona (30 minutes by train). The owner of the family farm (James) is very friendly and helpful. At our request, he makes reservations at a friend's eatery (also near the beach) where we eat a divine tortilla. There is no shade on the meadow. For us (end of March) fine."
397754,2628662,5,Tvc,28/03/2023,"Good option if you want to visit Barcelona on a budget. 5 euro per night during low season, 10 euro during high season. It is a grass gield without any facilities. Difficult to find the place, best to contact the owner via Whats App."
397754,2615926,5,Kristelkla,19/03/2023,Jaume is a very nice host. Very accommodating and friendly. He also always made sure everything was fine with us. It's very quiet on the meadow and the train station is a 10-minute walk away. For 3.60 you can reach Barcelona by train in 40 minutes. I would come back anytime.
397754,2609534,5,WilmaOnTheRoad123,14/03/2023,Very nice reception. We stood 6 days. We were in Barcelona for 4 days and considered it safe. Good starting point to reach Barcelona. Nice host who paid attention to our WoMo... I can only give 5 stars if you are self-sufficient. The driveway is a bit narrow but works with a 5.70 long motorhome without any problems. It was a pleasure…
397754,2607347,4,Pherenike,12/03/2023,"As described, there is no supply except for waste disposal. But the place is nice and quiet on a meadow.

The photos show it, you are standing on a concrete slab above a garage. No farm. When everything is ready, a place with the necessary facilities, partial sea view. Unfortunately, the barking of dogs from the nearby animal shelter is also annoying."

We stayed for two nights accompanied by one other group each of the nights. The access to the spot can be very tricky and is certainly not recommended when it has rained. So far no trash, please keep it that way. Hike to Agua Amarga takes around 40 minnutes."

You open the door of the truck and behind the bush you find some paper toilet. I don't want to be vulgar regardless of the nationality of this ass paper, whoever does that is rotten! After that, it complains that everything pays off."
397922,2649821,3,ClareMarcos,08/04/2023,"Visited during Easter week.
Large flat área with several other vans parked. 10 min walk to the beach (which cannot be accessed by van due to 2.2m barrier), walking to the end of the beach a path takes you up the cliff to fort and old town, total 30min round walk
Quiet night, slept with the sound of the giant waves."
397922,2647931,4,txampe,07/04/2023,It is nothing more than a soulless parking lot with 4 motorhomes that gave us more security having them nearby. We did not sleep here but it is good to visit and eat in Nazare and enjoy its beaches.
397922,2647165,5,dref59,07/04/2023,"Superb place in the middle of the pines, very close to the sea with its superb waves. Of course without services. Very quiet at night. Respect this superb place without unpacking anything because it is not an area but a tolerance :)."

397964,2872176,4,camperandoforte,19/06/2023,Quite a few spots in the area. We parked next to an embassy and it felt really safe because it was heavily monitored with cameras and guards. You can park up to 4 hours and that's enforced by entering the license plate in the parking machine.

We only met a family there who was returning from the viewpoint when arriving in the evening, otherwise no one. Be careful if it rains, possibility of getting stuck. No shade."
397997,2739174,5,furcampervan,10/05/2023,"A safe, quiet and beautiful place to spend the night. 5/10/2023 we spent the night completely alone. It doesn't have any services, but the views are worth it. The entrance is easy and AC enters without problems"
397997,2645215,5,ruedasypatas,07/04/2023,"The views are incredible. The road seems to be complicated but no, it can be passed without problems. If you continue forward there is space to park to one side and enjoy the scenery even more. Do not forget to leave everything as you found it, do not throw garbage, there are several areas that look like real garbage cans... a pity"
397997,2625061,5,MoritzFiege,26/03/2023,"Incredible place. Quiet night, fantastic stars and you feel like you are on the moon. There are two streets, definitely take the western one, the eastern one is narrow and very jagged. There are various places along the road, in total at least 5-6 bays."
397997,2606433,5,pepsiderhund,12/03/2023,"We spent 3 quiet nights here. There are different areas where you can stand. From time to time locals come to take pictures or to walk the dog. The ranger drives through here once a day. Unfortunately, rubble was dumped in the rear area. Attention dog owners, there are rabbits in the back area. Spectacular sunrise and sunset views. Shopping in Anabilla."
397997,2598961,4,rvanvugt,05/03/2023,"Just follow the sign ""Ruta de Huertas/Barrancos"" to have the easiest acces to this wonderful piece of nature. Absolutely stunning views, sunset and sunrise at a new level. Hiking possibilities, quiet during night, unfortunately also some garbage around. During the day very few visitors pass by. Guardia Civil passed by too and did not say anything, I spend 3 nights in this area."
398013,2741243,3,Travel2be1star,11/05/2023,"Very nice view but... PLEASE NOTE: it is forbidden to sleep there, this place is part of the nature reserve. We were dislodged by park rangers..."

398075,3267550,4,malarkeyeasy,07/09/2023,"Because our boat from Spain was delayed, we stayed here overnight. Quite a lot of people until midnight, but quiet after that. Didn't see a security guard, but did see two truck drivers who said it was okay to sleep. Wake up beautifully!"
398075,2890260,5,Oreli35,25/06/2023,Alright. Calme. We were rocked by the wind and the waves. 3€ per night because we have not yet been able to exchange our money. A gentleman came in a yellow vest to ask us for the money. his name is Abdou. no one else came to bother us.
398075,2760391,4,antonja,18/05/2023,"Super good place to stand over a night! We deduct the star because people come here who pretend to be the groundskeeper and want some DHM for standing. Pay attention to the color of the safety vest: yellow= real guard, red/orange= liar."
398075,2707310,5,BrunoPeters,29/04/2023,"very, very good place to get your bearings when coming from Algeciras. Or, like me right now, to spend the night here to take the first ferry tomorrow morning. Very safe and really quiet. Restaurants and shops within walking distance.."

398075,2653336,5,VanlifersOnTour,09/04/2023,"Unquestionably 5 stars. Very well placed for the arrival of the ferries or for the departure (15 min). Nice quiet and relatively protected place. You feel safe there and facing the sea. We highly recommend it. Leave comments to help our community of travelers. Respect the places and promote the local economy, this is how we are welcomed."
398075,2646571,4,Grauwal999,07/04/2023,"Arrived in the dark. Thought the place was closed because a rope was stretched. But the entrance is right at the bottom in front of the barrier. You shouldn't stand at the bottom, the port police want to have a view. The place is a bit sloping. After 20 minutes, the ""groundsman"" arrived with the obligatory high-visibility vest. 30DH very friendly."
398075,2642857,5,RobertRe,06/04/2023,"We arrived at 11pm, parked in the parking lot and after 30 minutes a very friendly gentleman gently knocked and asked for the 30 dh parking fee. It is a recommended place for an overnight stay near the ferry port. In the morning you have a beautiful view of the bay. There is an ATM nearby and a pharmacy that was still open at 11pm."
398075,2629391,1,Tornjak,29/03/2023,"Access a bit complicated for tall people, I didn't stay."

quiet and secure."
398075,2592026,5,PhiletCathy,26/02/2023,Very convenient either before or after the ferry - 15 minutes from the port. Very friendly guardian asked us for 30 Dirhams for the night.

398090,2628030,5,Pauli-1983,28/03/2023,Here you can stand well. In the first row directly on the water it can happen that you are sent away. But no registration and no penalties.

398119,2834307,3,autocaravanariga,09/06/2023,"It is a car park next to a sports center, unpaved but fairly flat. Parking is fine for a day in Redondela it is a few minutes from the center of town. I don't think there are problems for spending the night there, that is if you don't mind that the environment is not very pretty. We parked the car all day without problems, but we didn't stay to sleep, there are better places nearby."
398134,2702953,5,LaMaga,28/04/2023,"I have had a very good experience. The campsite is very well located, it is clean and Johanna, the morning receptionist, has been super friendly upon my arrival. I took advantage of an offer to pay in advance for 3 days, plus one free and it has been a good decision, since it gave me time to visit Tavira, Cabanas and Santa Luzia. In general, the site is quiet, the train can be heard, but it doesn't bother."
398166,2652507,5,Kimskrams,09/04/2023,"Everything worked great and was very clean. I met the owner and she was very, very friendly and helpful. She has a caravan herself and is happy about P4N’s customers!"

398166,2590802,5,RaquelPascual,25/02/2023,"Great, we arrived and parked in the same door of the laundry. In 1 hour all clean and dry clothes, with a very good smell. While we washed we went to the Aldi supermarket which is right next door."

398192,3188267,1,soul.survivor,20/08/2023,"Lots of through traffic as the mall is open until 10pm. In the evening around half past ten a manager came out and asked us to leave the place because the parking spaces at the back were only for employees. There is a bus parking lot at the top with 4 parking spaces, but not recommended. The front parking spaces are limited to 2.2m."

398253,2957261,3,PacoMata,13/07/2023,"It is a very busy street from 8am to 1am. and many vehicles pass by, and not exactly slowly. You can spend the night without a problem, but no shadows. Positive, you have a bike lane and the city a 10/15 minute walk away and the views are very good. In my opinion, to spend a night and visit the city."

398253,2751195,3,moritzkaden,15/05/2023,"When we arrived we saw broken glass from a car window on the floor. Usually an indication of thieves. We only used the parking lot to go to the Boca do Inferno. However, I would not visit the city from here. I don't recommend sleeping either because the road is very busy."
398253,2729362,5,mvgm,06/05/2023,Very nice site. It is the only free parking area. There are no services but it is very quiet at night. During the day there is a lot of movement. 100% recommendable .

Then it is quiet until dawn. I parked on the left, the last spot, which gives me leeway and fairly level, just a bit of a slope to the right. Be careful, it is the last free site on the entire promenade"
398258,3172412,4,CamperRutea,18/08/2023,"A fairly quiet place to spend the night. There is a grove of trees that was very good for us to be in the shade since we arrived in the afternoon. Although a town road passes next to it, traffic is very scarce. There is a drinking water fountain that comes in handy."
398258,3148945,1,Lor.pm,14/08/2023,Area full of clouds of mosquitoes that do not allow you to be. Better to look for another place because it really becomes unsustainable
398261,2925525,3,mralbertoma,05/07/2023,"Acceptable, it is not very clear if you can enter since a little before there is a no-entry sign (there is another parallel road that leads to a little building), being next to the highway there is noise from cars, we have not had mosquito problems."

Some shops and bars nearby, leaving on the left after 200m. Before reaching this parking lot, at the roundabout on the left there is an institute with immense, well-leveled esplanades. You can stop by there first and see."

398305,2847148,3,JanSchulte,12/06/2023,Great location! In the park surrounded by animals and great nature. Good ambiance and nice mood. Also extremely successful One star deducted due to the lack of a toilet seat. Another star deduction due to the lack of paper -> risk of getting stuck. In front of the cabins there is a roll from which you can tear off something. You just have to think about it. Have fun and good luck

Even when i got back to my friend (male) he wouldn’t stop and started asking if we are alone, while playing with a long rubber band. And he kept following us for a while until more people arrived. Worth visiting but do not visit/ stay overnight alone !!!"

398829,2652751,5,cdekah,09/04/2023,I can only agree with the other reviews. A very nice place with great hosts. Supply and disposal also possible in Tortosa (8km). A bike ride on the Via Verde is highly recommended.
398829,2635955,5,petermatt,02/04/2023,"We stayed for one night and felt very comfortable under the olive trees. Since we didn't find the way immediately despite Google Maps, the hostess set out on our way and came a little way towards us. So great! The Via Verde can be easily driven from here. At the end you have to climb a short, crisp stretch back up to the parking space. Push if necessary :-)"
398829,2602457,5,LisaHeidi,08/03/2023,"Super nice between the olive trees! Spent one night here & felt very comfortable, you had a lot of privacy. Getting there wasn't a problem.

398834,3192722,1,Vickymt,21/08/2023,Do not park here. the sites are tight and you can't park anywhere. only in those with the motorhome painted. We are 7 motorhomes parked and they fined us all €80. I do not recommend it.

398846,3144169,5,LaPerlaNegra,14/08/2023,"The access app is Resasport. The area is located within CD San Miguel. Emptying and filling is outside the area. To get there, Google Maps has taken us along a rocky road, but the road to Lerin-Tafalla would be better from what we can see. The app is not complex, but there was no sign indicating which app to use. The townspeople are generally very friendly."

To enter you have to register in an application that personally took me a bit to register but then everything was perfect. A person from the town hall came and gave me a hand. Less than 10 min from the town on foot where you have all kinds of shops. Thanks to the town hall for betting on this type of tourism and having made this area.
398846,2671012,2,muneta,15/04/2023,"the location is complicated with the GPS, in the background the sports center with lights and noise. It is on the outskirts of the town where there are not too many views around. A place to do what has to be done and little else."
398846,2661956,1,kateandmark,11/04/2023,Very complicated system to get the barrier to lift. First read the Qr code then you have to install a Google ap which won’t install on Apple devices. Installed Googlechrome but still said no device found. After 35 minutes using up battery and data we gave up. Looked a good facility but will be little used with so many hoops to jump through. Easier to just drive to the next town which we did

This weekend (April 1) is the inauguration and there will be lunch at 11:30 a.m. In addition, it coincides that there are many events in the town, such as a guided tour of the Castle on Saturday (1:00 p.m.) and a walk along the river path on Sunday (9:00 a.m.)."
398846,2625986,4,the-globetrotter,27/03/2023,"There is still construction going on at the green areas and we had the gate open and there was no indication of any costs. However, it is more of a mobile home parking lot than a parking space, because you are not allowed to put out and use camping chairs etc. (according to a sign). You can hear it a bit when there is a football game, it didn't bother us. The pre and disposal super."

I think it's a nice place to hike"
398859,3051715,5,eldelacajita,31/07/2023,"We spent 2 nights, the first with two other ACs and the second, alone. It is a quiet place, next to a small pine forest and the river, near the town and the beginning of the route to visit the caves and mills. The water loading and unloading facility is very good. We recommend the Moreno bakery."
398859,2706118,1,OlivierVanlife,29/04/2023,"It's actually quite neatly located, but you feel a bit like you're in a large lattice box and if you're under the roof like me, no sun gets on the solar panel, so no electricity...

Could not park anywhere and get out of van without treading in it. We have a dog. We pick up after our dog, but we knew eventually someone would stand in it and bring it into van. We did not stay."

You can be in the city center in 30 minutes by train or bus and walk to the beach in 5 minutes. We stayed here for 2 nights and felt safe. It only got louder at night and early in the morning because the street was used by pedestrians to go to the beach and to the clubs on the beach.

Price-performance is absolutely okay :) Unfortunately, we had the bad luck that the driveway was too steep for us with a 9.40m trailer, so we got an alternative place. So far, so sweet.

398995,2941158,3,MSchollbach,09/07/2023,"A super nice parking space at the vineyard. Attention - coordinates lead you completely wrong and you come out in the middle of the wine-growing region. Just follow the Parc du National signs and you will get to the pitch. However, we were unlucky that the young people of the village held a holiday party until 5 o'clock in the morning just on our day. This can often happen during the holidays."
398995,2899948,5,radimen,28/06/2023,Beautifully situated place with fresh water electricity and waste disposal facilities. Adjacent to a beautiful park and vineyards. A nice family even unlocked the toilet for us in the evening. Many thanks to the community?

398995,2774164,3,Peran,21/05/2023,"The area is very good, the park and town are great, but I imagine that it is not finished because the light sockets are on a wall so high that it is impossible to plug it in unless you have a ladder. At night everything remains dark without any streetlights, it gives a feeling of insecurity. What was said on a great day and thanks to the City Council."
398995,2749599,5,YuditFernandez,14/05/2023,Very quiet place with all services. A spectacular park next door. Thank you very much to the City Council.

398995,2659847,5,raquelnaia,10/04/2023,"We went to load and unload water and we ended up staying for two days. The area is next to the La Mejorada Natural Park and it is spectacular, with all the services, including electricity. The guided visit to the Cueva de la Vieja is well worth it, which includes a guided visit to the town and the Pozo de la Nieve. I hope people are responsible and take care of the environment and the services they provide us."
398995,2650942,4,Josuneldv,08/04/2023,"Do not follow the GPS indications, it takes you to dirt roads between vineyards. Follow the signs for Parque de la Mejorada. Very large area with all services, inaugurated a month ago."

We helped the farmers to catch them and put them out to pasture. If someone parks here often, it will probably be problematic for the farmer. road not paved. Not very level."
399036,2683658,4,pozdrozoVanie,20/04/2023,"clean water, supposedly suitable for drinking. The problem with pouring if you have the inlet on the left side because the tap is next to a busy road. but it works :)"

399084,2626268,5,dinappedj,27/03/2023,"This place is like from fairy tales. We pitched our van between Olive trees, straight after we got a vine tasting and little tour around the farm. Later Ana Luisa offered us to have a dinner together with hosts. She cooked black pork cheeks, which was super tasty. 
Marc and Ana Luisa are exceptional hosts. We were sad to leave. You go there and you want to stay there for much longer."

Those that are more towards the center are not recommended because it is very narrow and steep, with no room to maneuver. So if you want to visit the town, it is better to leave it in this or another of those that are paid at the entrance to the town. The least good thing is that it is a short walk to the center of town."

399130,2653086,5,francis089,09/04/2023,"Site with good access, I was a weekend and they charged me €5 for the whole day, a charming site and very friendly and we decided to repeat this Easter weekend and I couldn't be better although I understood that with the crowd of people being a large vehicle I was charged €10, since I was occupying the space of two vehicles, totally recommended, and during the week and normal weekends without so many people it's amazing"
399130,2639717,2,mobilvetamalembe,04/04/2023,"At the entrance of the town they already tell you that motorhomes are prohibited and the parking option, whether you stay a couple of hours or 24 hours, is 5 euros. It seems to be the flat rate of the town since further up we find this sign again. It seemed a bit abusive to us, really! A pity because you already enter the town with that negative point. However, it is worth the visit!"
399136,3132957,4,pimpelb,12/08/2023,"small parking lot on the road. With a mobile home you have to stand sideways, so you take up a lot of space. Best not to arrive too early. Hardly any traffic at night. Lots of people until sunset, then much quieter. Nice location with the swing!"
399136,3082085,5,Tanlali,05/08/2023,"Superb view, small car park on the side of the road. After sunset there are not too many cars. 1 or 2 places rather flat. Ideal to be surrounded by nature. No service, but village 5 minutes away with café and mini-market. Perfect for star gazing."
399146,2800408,5,martinfletcher,29/05/2023,"Good, sheltered place to keep the motorhome whilst walking the Camino. Reasonably priced and very secure."
399147,2708647,2,Rober80n7,30/04/2023,"It is very badly indicated, to empty gray and black water (to do the latter you have to be a sniper). The cars park in the area, I had to ask a person to remove the car or I would not have been able to unload."
399147,2664190,2,Dandilucki,12/04/2023,poorly marked. but perfect for downloading gray and black.
399147,2662442,1,Passiflore68,11/04/2023,"the dump area is just below the sign, at the corner of the small street that leads to the car park. thank you to the municipality it is already that to be able to empty correctly."
399147,2645963,1,Kikezuma,07/04/2023,"It is in the highest part of the sports center, at the access to the car park. Access is not indicated. Emptying of grays is a square with drainage grates that is at a different level than the road surface. Black emptied, a small 10 cm lid with a chain that, when lifted, reveals a drain pipe. You have to basket, without water to rinse or clean, laugh"
399147,2625483,1,guiboix,26/03/2023,Very poorly indicated. A very small grate for gray water and they park cars on it.

399159,3243722,4,Marratxi,31/08/2023,"Today 08/31 we will sleep over. Very calm. When we arrived there was no one. A motorhome arrived a little later, and surprisingly left in the dark. In the end, we did the same. Since three teenagers came to the area to disturb. Thanks to the people of Castejon. When I have enough, it will be 5 stars"
399159,3240736,5,Lucas_Chloe,31/08/2023,"Very good place to sleep, place for about 10-12 motorhomes and everything very clean, you can empty gray water and toilet and fill it for free, please let's keep these places clean!!!"

399159,3177648,4,jdapalma,18/08/2023,"New area with very spacious delimited spaces. I don't give it 5 because the environment doesn't offer much and that it is completely fenced in is a bit strange, you feel caged."
399159,3137015,4,Ohana12,13/08/2023,"It's good to stop for a while, with the pool next door if you go with children, and with a walk to walk the dogs. Thank you very much for this area!"

But one is missing for the residual waste, so this is unfortunately disposed of in the other. Through traffic until about 11.30 p.m. After that calm. Brightly illuminated. Muchas Gracias!"
399159,2796372,4,raimontarr,28/05/2023,"very good area. New, clean Quiet, bright. It is worth deviating from the National, about 2km. Thank you very much City Council"

399159,2624190,3,Grufti63,25/03/2023,"Of course it's nice for us campers that the city makes such a place available, thank you very much. But: the place was probably the loudest parking space on my 4.5-month trip so far. Noise from children, young people and residents until 11:15 p.m. and afterwards and a lot of traffic from the truck parking lot right next to a residential arterial road. No shadows. Very brightly lit at night."
399159,2612602,3,remicaquelard,17/03/2023,new area very well laid out except perhaps in relation to the exit. Are the panels necessary thank you to the municipality we will come back
399159,2612213,3,ramirlan,17/03/2023,"Correct, clean, new, quiet area, without noise except for a distant car. Things that could be improved: leaving the area forces you to make a turn onto a street where there are parked vehicles and makes the operation difficult. It could be solved by letting out where you enter since there is a lot of space. Another point that can be improved is that there are no containers to leave the garbage, there is a tiny trash can."
399159,2610119,2,lserrat5,15/03/2023,"The area is not very quiet, movement and noise have been heard all night. It doesn't give much peace of mind."

399163,2642167,3,TxetxuNeno,05/04/2023,"small parking lot on a dirt esplanade not specified by AC, without services of any kind, at the beginning of the ant route. It was marked with lime on the ground, so it will be erased in days, spaces in battery but vehicles larger than 6 m would not fit. We parked occupying the first two in a transversal direction."
399173,2602069,5,Cara-vanlifer,07/03/2023,"Magnificent view of the lake and the mountains. Set back from the main road, continue the small path for 50m and you will have the possibility of parking at the foot of the two-stem tree without obstructing the passage. A second place also possible against the grove before the ruin. Attention, certainly only possible out of season."
399195,3101183,4,kochi-96,08/08/2023,"slept near the yard. quiet but a man came late at night and told us it's ok to stay the night, the community knows about us and if we need anything we should contact them. Pay attention to the ebb and flow by the water"
399197,3134504,3,Julia1501,13/08/2023,"Good if you want to visit Olhao for maximum one night. Bit noisy, bit dirty, shady guys walking around. I wouldn‘t go there if I was alone."

399226,2605475,4,overlandpack,11/03/2023,"Stayed here for 1 night. Nice and quiet, only a few hikers and motorbikes went passed throughout the afternoon. Slept through without any issues. The only reason this spot didn’t get a fifth star was because of the placement on the hillside - we camped in March and lost the sun at around 4pm, whereas the other spot we found (which I highly recommend you check out) we got sun from morning to night."
399232,2899664,5,JorgeVoyagerAroundTheWorld,27/06/2023,A good place for sure

399252,2696683,2,whitmad,25/04/2023,"Close to a busy cafe frequented by locals. The streets of the village are narrow and tricky in places. We stopped for lunch but moved on to the Cartagena football ground for the night. Alumbre felt safe enough, but we did feel a little out of place."

399275,3003305,2,Iree,22/07/2023,nice view and good for a night or 2 but it should be mentioned that there's no access to the lake except in the village 1km from here.
399275,2734184,2,martinww,08/05/2023,Nice view of the lake but right next to the road and very visible. We decided to move on.

399319,2981807,4,biibi34,18/07/2023,Super beautiful place! However very popular with locals! But if you go a bit before the spot in question you have large stretches of beach where you can settle down in peace!
399319,2603054,5,akosweszp,08/03/2023,"Really good spot! The dirt road a bit steep but not too much, only for vans.  Place for 3-4 vans, relatively leveled, road close by but minimal traffic. Direct access to the lake, kayak or SUP recommended."

399359,2604139,5,HangSlack,09/03/2023,"I ve camped here twice, 3 weeks each time. A peaceful place which is great to use as a basecamp while viewing properties. Private and quiet and the pigs are charming and friendly."

399360,2758716,5,RoWiWu,18/05/2023,"Spent 2 days here with Carlos and a lovely young family. The place is flat and clean, everything that is described is correct and if you can copy the coordinates and are also able to enter them into Google maps, it shouldn't be a problem to find the place. If I'm around again, it's a place of choice."
399360,2662183,5,sarayds10,11/04/2023,"we had a great night! Carlos is a very kind person who helps you with everything. I recommend several very beautiful routes since it is located in a privileged area if you are a bicycle lover or you like mountain routes. In addition, the place is quiet, ideal to rest and next to the town in case you need something. If I return to the area I will repeat without hesitation!"

You have gray and black water services with potable water, simple and clean bathrooms and showers. The owner Rafa is a charm and they have a variety of adventure activities to choose from. By being there you have free access to the source of the baths where you can bathe in the river."

Five minutes from the fountain of the baths and they give you the entrance with the activity that if it is not 3.5 euros per person, to visit the town very well also 5 minutes from everything. Rafael, the owner treated us very well."
399381,2966721,5,pacobensan,15/07/2023,"Undoubtedly a successful place, in the middle of nature but a step away from the town. Rafa's initiative is a success as it combines rest and adventure in an idyllic setting. Wishing to repeat!"
399381,2965079,5,EsolaMagu,14/07/2023,"A quiet place to go with the family and the dog. Our intention was to stay only one night, but given the local plan options and offers, we stayed 3 nights. Very good treatment from the local staff and the boss. A great place for climbing and multi-adventure activities. If you have any questions or needs, feel free to ask because they will be happy to help you. Really recommended!"

399404,2769145,5,MariaHeidi,20/05/2023,new asphalt parking. some sloping places. no shadow. great for visiting San Roque. Illuminated.
399404,2734300,5,Babsit6,08/05/2023,Spent a peaceful night here. You can also watch the sunset from here very nicely.
399404,2611198,4,HenkTraveler,16/03/2023,"Nice view, lots of space, spent the night quietly. Supermarket at 500 meters."
399427,2782724,4,jlr974,24/05/2023,Exceptionally quiet; passage of sheep only.
399427,2715556,5,Romy1306,02/05/2023,Beautiful spot! Spent the evening and night admiring the beautiful reservoir and the wildlife. So quiet and peaceful! To be appreciated and respected!!!
399458,3268646,1,mjosejose,07/09/2023,"The only good thing is the proximity to the city, otherwise nothing, it is dirty, surrounded by trucks and cars. The road from the access to the area is disgusting and it is scary to go at night. The guy who served us was very nice."
399458,3266644,1,Juanpi,06/09/2023,"A plain esplanade used by cars from a dangerous logistics company because they fight with cars when they drive there. services that leave a lot to be desired, cleanliness and the price seem expensive for what a bad location. Lucky that there is an Aldi relatively close and the bus number 41 that goes to the center. I won't come back from that I'm sure"
399458,3252308,2,NicolasMuch,03/09/2023,"everything very dirty. I think it could be cleaner. There are places that charge you half and were spectacular in terms of cleanliness. What yes, the people who served us gave a 10"
399458,3251395,3,spoiler123,02/09/2023,"The person at the entrance gate is very friendly and helpful. There is a central power distributor, an extension is necessary. We arrived at 25 degrees, certainly not a pleasant experience in midsummer because there was no shade. Seville is within easy walking distance. If you want to park your car and your belongings safely, this is absolutely the right place for you. Toilets and shower were clean."
399458,3230657,2,josianesouchon,28/08/2023,Motorhome area which is only a few places in the middle of a car park either for sale or damaged vehicles. 35 degrees in the shade. we can just go out. 50 m walk from the center. dirty but secure. you really have to want to visit Seville. already done for us we go our way.
399458,3210729,4,arsenio96,24/08/2023,"You can enter with the caravan until 10 pm, but then you can enter and leave by foot at any hour (just have to call a number to enter). It is a strange place, but surveilled and apparently safe. 30 minute walk from the city center, which is great. Shower and bathroom 24h, not very clean but they're ok. Staff is nice"
399458,3200156,3,SteerM,22/08/2023,"Super secured parking space. Super friendly staff. Showers and toilet are not really private but very clean. Electricity, fresh and waste water available."
399458,3199414,4,aolcoz,22/08/2023,Correct place to spend the night with surveillance. Decent showers and services open 24 hours. Difficult to locate since you have to go through a port area with prohibition signs.
399458,3191150,4,simon3102,21/08/2023,"Great to see Seville. We must have stood here one night and looked at Seville. Shower toilet facilities are open 24 hours a day. The facility is guarded 24 hours a day. There are also points for fresh water, toilet disposal and gray water. €18 for about 24 hours"
399458,3191007,1,soniaoceano,20/08/2023,We were unable to find it difficult with the navigator which made us enter the port area with access only for authorized persons
399458,3175327,3,Sonnenmobil110,18/08/2023,"Actually, it's more of a truck stop, with lots of parking spaces. Very friendly at the reception. There is a shower and toilet. Not a luxury, but it's enough for the essentials. Seville is easily accessible, about 15-20 minutes walk. If you're a cat lover, bring a sack of cat food! We felt very safe at night and our camper was parked safely, you couldn't just drive off the yard."
399458,3156267,3,mpiva,15/08/2023,"Pros: distance from the centre, 10 minutes by bike, the entire cycle path, security (gate closed during the night), friendly and helpful people. Cons: dirty and insufficient bathrooms, electricity often goes out. Too bad because it doesn't take much."
399458,3135991,2,park4nightsilver,13/08/2023,"Welcoming staff, but flat on the maintenance of the area! The bins are full and not emptied every day, the pool is greenish and cloudy. Water not drinkable and above all impossible to reach Seville by bike because there is only the highway so either the bus, but there are 2 to 3 per day or you go there by motorhome so not relaxing. Ideal for one night no more"
399458,3128335,5,alinedundee,12/08/2023,"secure parking gray water, black water, water to fill. Sanitary ok. showers ok. in the evening there is a number to contact to open the gate: the staff arrives in less than 3 minutes. it is perfect impeccable for visiting seville. (by bike, there is the track that runs along the road, it's ideal.) we slept there: very quiet."
399458,3122773,3,crocotrotter,11/08/2023,so yes the area is not pleasant and the toilets are spartan but to visit Seville in complete safety it's perfect and really cheap 15 € .. we even have to walk back to the center (30 min)
399458,3101556,2,olgnaydn,08/08/2023,This place is side business of big car repair company. You park your camper next to damaged cars. No place here to hide from the killing heat in Sevilla. Even during the night it was 35+ Celcius. Worth mentioning that we were not allowed to leave out with our camper after check-in. They told us that you can only leave with your camper after checkout. However responsible person called us taxi.
399458,3098128,3,CaroleSerinet,08/08/2023,"Motorhome area difficult to find, it is mixed with a large garage for cars and vans. Security is total with a guard 24h00 on 24. Close to the center of Seville we moved by bike. Not very expensive 14€ without electricity. I recommend."
399458,3066285,2,Pippo75i,03/08/2023,"The location is excellent for visiting Seville, the place is safe, the positive notes stop here ... Wi-Fi non-existent, a few shade cloths, showers, services would be enough ... in short, you have to work hard to reach enough"
399458,3061624,4,Mariekoch0404,02/08/2023,"We stayed there for one night, felt pretty safe and was able to walk into town. However, the way to get there seems quite remote and unfortunately the gate is closed overnight for security reasons, so you have to call the number there."
399458,3050867,4,Averz,31/07/2023,"Stayed for 2 nights, do not expect a lot from this place! Very basic, does have electric if needed. Gates get locked at 10 there is a number to call it back later however this didn’t work! We had to climb over the gates to gain entry. Staff arnt particularly friendly. However, good access to city 15 mins by bike. Water refil black/ grey disposal"
399458,3037326,4,Bratz_Boy,29/07/2023,area with a lot of security although to go back to sleep at night there are two barriers which do not allow access by taxi and you will have to call the parking staff so that they come to pick you up at the main entrance (500 meters) I put one star less for access night without being well published although good area to visit the city
399458,3034643,5,thehomeless,28/07/2023,Excellent stopover area for visiting Seville! It is a car workshop that gives campers the opportunity to stop. Super safe even at night because it is closed by two gates and there is a guard. We slept peacefully without noise. Cycle path that reaches up to one hundred. (among other things Seville is a WONDERFUL city) recommended!
399458,3027423,4,JPANDCO,27/07/2023,"This corner is not bucolic but has the merit of existing. Town center within walking distance, security because guarded day and night. Water electricity emptying and sanitary brief but clean. Remember to provide cash, do not take credit cards"
399458,3025232,2,mallorcacamper,26/07/2023,The place is not very charming on a workshop site. The nearest road is about 400m away and leads through unsightly remote industrial/harbor area. All not very inviting.
399458,3005223,2,matste,23/07/2023,"The closest support to the city, not good bathrooms but with the essentials. The place is inside a shadeless parking lot where they trade cars. Positive note, you're safe, security at night and during the day a lot of workers working there"
399458,3000077,4,Carlosmude,22/07/2023,"Parking in the port of Seville, very attentive and friendly in the reception. All the services. 10 minutes by bike from the center of Seville. Perfect to get to know Seville and spend the night"
399458,2988785,5,kellysito,19/07/2023,"It is a workshop and place to store cars and where it is possible to park motorhomes. It came in quite handy because when I arrived I noticed a diesel leak, they solved the problem for me the next day. I felt very safe"
399458,2933082,3,corinnect,07/07/2023,"not my best experience. strange environment. it is a huge parking lot, a garage and what else. lots of trucks, parked cars. quite far from Seville especially by 40 degrees. no shade. Insufficient sanitary facilities, not very clean, which does not close. positive point: ultra secure, at 10:00 p.m., the love gate is closed. you have to call to be opened. nice staff.paw expensive."
399458,2905563,5,akv359,29/06/2023,"Located 20/25 min from the center of Seville but very accessible. Good services, complete. Rate according to the rest of the places. recommendable"
399458,2900586,4,dnaadventure,28/06/2023,Was a bit tricky to find but secure parking lot with washroom and camper facilities. They had electrical panel but needed extra long extension cord to access. Quiet at night but lots of people and moving of cars in morning. Walking distance to Center of city or easy bus access. People helpful and friendly.
399458,2889608,4,tamara35,25/06/2023,It is not the best area in which we have been but it has to empty gray and black and you can walk to the center of Seville. We went in a caravan and a dog and everything was very good. Quiet at night to rest. There is an Aldi just outside the area. It has toilets and showers.
399458,2884691,4,thesleepysprinter,23/06/2023,We stayed here for 2 nights whilst visiting Seville. It is not picturesque but that’s not why we stayed here. We wanted somewhere we knew the van would be safe when leaving it for the day. We filled up and emptied our water too which was helpful
399458,2880336,3,jeanmichelgeorget,22/06/2023,"area good for 1 night and to visit Seville, entrance exit emptying and filling complicated."
399458,2875857,2,Melisahaarth,21/06/2023,"We did not find this place, it sends by roads only for authorized vehicles from the port."
399458,2875312,2,Mastrobirraio,20/06/2023,"It is not a camper parking area, but a car and industrial vehicle park with a portion of space reserved for campers. The discharges / loads of water should be improved, the showers are embarrassing. Payment by cash only, bank cards are not accepted. Supervision okay. A city with a very high tourist vocation, it should better welcome those who decide to visit it with a motor caravan"
399458,2860891,4,lefelon,16/06/2023,Very well located for the visit services on site no need elec for 2 days quiet and secure nights
399458,2856628,3,simonschrafen,15/06/2023,"The place is well located to visit Seville. There is electricity. There are only two places to plug in, the cables are constantly being run over. The sanitary facilities are not clean, there is only one toilet/shower which you cannot lock. The place is in a workshop yard, which means there are many workers here during the week who race through the area with their cars. Not for longer"
399458,2852023,4,samsoncatherine,13/06/2023,"area very well located for visiting the city, count 10 to 15 minutes by bike to reach the main tourist sites. Moreover, having had an alternator failure, I would like to thank the vehicle repair shop located in this area, which was able to show reactivity to help us out in one morning in order to continue our trip in the best conditions. I recommend"
399458,2851996,4,Hobby20,13/06/2023,"The parking space is ok. (4 stars) We drove today with our 2 bicycles on a clear, bright day to the center of the city and took a taxi back without bicycles. Thank you Seville we will not visit this city again."
399458,2845828,2,Urs4410,12/06/2023,"Asphalted place without shade, but tidy, so far OK. Toilets and washrooms: toilet cannot be locked from the inside, no paper, no soap. Toilet and also the washing facilities completely dirty."
399458,2834570,2,Grubenbecher,09/06/2023,"Light and shadow: great location if you have bikes to visit Seville (by the way my top favorite of all cities in Europe ❤️). The square itself is just a large parking lot with a lot of traffic. Technically ok, sanitary minimal (one toilet that cannot be locked) and moderately clean. So really only for sleeping. We would not come back."
399458,2830125,4,Mitsou,07/06/2023,"Ideal for visiting Seville However, it is not a campsite. It is a very dirty garage But a few minutes from the center of Seville We appreciated the proximity to Seville and are ready to sleep there But no more"
399458,2819196,4,CamperlifeSundP,04/06/2023,"It's just a car park and not a campsite, but very convenient for spending a day in Seville. We felt very safe. Super bike path to the city, 15 minutes to the city center. Toilets and showers are available, but clean is something else. Black water drainage available. Totally fine for one night."
399458,2803591,5,Avonturenverzamelen,30/05/2023,"Good place, close to the center of Seville. The description clearly describes what it is and that is exactly as it is. We have been fine here for two nights. Nice and quiet at night. We went into Seville by bike. Great to do with our kids aged 6 and 10. We left in the morning at 7 am for the APK inspection in Seville. All was no problem."
399458,2802089,4,bradshaw,30/05/2023,"(continued) 2 poles for 100 pitches, if you are not close to a pole you will need 50m of cable. Quiet night. Cassette drain ok (placed at the corner of the building, in the middle of the passage and next to the washing machines.) and the water and full water drain is at the other corner of the building.. why.."
399458,2802080,4,bradshaw,30/05/2023,"(following). The car park is large (part is reserved for a car trade), flat, fairly clean, no shade, it is not too pretty but it is secured 24 hours a day by 1 security guard, perfect (there are parking spaces "" free"" on the place of the ""Féria Abril"" .. but not very reassuring). Access to Seville on foot in 20 minutes, a magnificent city. The only problem with this area is the electrical connection, 2 poles (continued"
399458,2802035,4,bradshaw,30/05/2023,"We parked 2 nights on this area, and even if we parked 3 days we only paid 2 nights.

After all is well, we fill out a form to report our arrival and we pay when we leave (continued"

There is a guard, it seems to me, who is present at night 200 meters from the entrance. The toilets are cleaned every day. The user is responsible for their degradation. No the staff..."
399458,2786808,3,LorraineundManuel,26/05/2023,"For parking and sleeping fully ok. But: The way from the center to the square is pretty dodgy. As a woman traveling alone, I would look for a place with a less awkward walk."
399458,2783757,3,park4ninghtAG,25/05/2023,"18 euros overnight plus electricity. Negative points: wifi does not work, their bathroom is not so good, it is 30 minutes from the center but walking you go through very deserted stretches, which is not good to walk at night."
399458,2782673,3,Phil10kn,24/05/2023,"Whatever one can write about the environment and the location, this guarded service area offers a good quality-price-location ratio. 14€ the cheapest, free water and emptying. Close to the city, very easy to reach by bike. Obviously this is not the comfort of a campsite. It suits me perfectly."
399458,2777880,1,ptitloup47,23/05/2023,Not recommended. Very narrow parking lot. Dirty sanitary. Nothing locks. No place to do the dishes. We won't be going back there again.
399458,2771367,4,Stratters,21/05/2023,"Be careful finding it - Apple maps took me to the wrong place completely ….. it is opposite Aldi! So bad points … scruffy, a bit dirty by the bins, limited services - but also good points: secure, only 14€ per night, 30 mins walk through park to Plaza de España …… much easier than driving all over city searching for a good spot."
399458,2769884,4,CarlosMarcelo,21/05/2023,"For Seville, the closest a taxi costs 6 euros to the center, he has a very long cable for electricity, the sockets are on two posts and if there is no place they have to have an extension cord and a three-phase socket, the bathrooms are very far and bad identified to find the place"
399458,2769614,4,139118,20/05/2023,"Better than expected reading the reviews. It's nothing extraordinary, but good for a night or two to visit the city. WC and shower available, not new but functional. Evictions and drinking water available. About half an hour walk to the city center. The price is reasonable."
399458,2765363,4,AndreasWiegmann,19/05/2023,certainly a very special environment. But in 10 minutes by bike to the Cathedral. The purpose justifies...
399458,2758695,4,tinos007,18/05/2023,"Good pitch. The old town of Seville can be reached on foot in about 30 minutes or by public transport. Toilet, shower, washing machine, water, waste water, chemical toilet and electricity available. Inexpensive. One point deducted for poor marking in the parking lot and not enough power connections."
399458,2752125,3,Napoleon27,15/05/2023,"It's really just a parking lot, nothing more! Plumbing was really disgusting, the place itself is in a good location and is fine!"

399458,2735887,3,MigueldeSalazar,09/05/2023,"The area is for what it is, and I explain myself. What an advantage it has that it is close to the center and you can go by bicycle because Seville is very well prepared for this vehicle. As an area it is not worth much since it really is as if it were a parking lot. It is not to be in it since it is not pleasant. The price, €14, is good for a big city and in my case the attention from the staff was correct"
399458,2733688,2,kan2baz,08/05/2023,"Where to start ? Execrable welcome, very dirty toilets, overflowing garbage cans, environment, close to a landfill, payment in cash when nothing is specified at the start, very long waiting time on arrival at departure…… In fact we are not as a complement to their activity. Avoid if possible"
399458,2729960,1,mikeleo,07/05/2023,"I don't recommend it to anyone. Calling this place a Motorhome Area can be misleading. There is a shower and a toilet for more than 300 motorhomes, you have to imagine security, the light poles are distributed so that the cables cross the road and the vehicles step on them, the garbage cans are scarce and full of bags without pick up, you share space with a vehicle company....."
399458,2721416,1,gavaness,04/05/2023,Expedited and unsmiling welcome. Very dirty place. You have to cross a no man's land dump to reach the cycle path. Very noisy night. Don't be in a hurry to leave: 1/4 of an hour of waiting for someone to deign to take care of the collection and then the opening of the gate!
399458,2721112,3,chrislb29,04/05/2023,"Has the merit of existing, 30 minutes walk from the cathedral or Alcazar. Cash payment !?"
399458,2691114,4,ReinerReisdorf,23/04/2023,"Yes, it's just a Womo area in a place at the car dealer. Yes, there is a lot of rubbish lying around. Yes, you stand close together. Yes, there are only a few pitches with electricity. And yet we give 4 points: The employees are super friendly. It's a safe parking space. You can get to pretty Seville by taxi, bike or on foot. Black and gray water disposal possible. We only wanted to stay here overnight."
399458,2688257,1,Luftgraf,22/04/2023,This is a car loading area only with an RV area. You stand side by side with 100 others. Camping behavior not allowed. WiFi too far away. But the worst thing is that on the weekends the party people let hammer music play for hours and drive around. Can't sleep!
399458,2688017,1,britta.gollub,22/04/2023,"The place is relatively central, one shower and one toilet for men/women old and dirty. We have refrained from using them. The place is dingy and looks more like a parking lot for all cars."
399458,2687493,4,familiagloria,22/04/2023,Ok to visit the city
399458,2684575,1,Anfrie,20/04/2023,"Just dirty and disgusting. You feel like you are in a junkyard in the port. One shower is in need of renovation, but at least warm and with enough pressure. The proximity to the city is the only thing that speaks for visiting this place."
399458,2681150,2,salkevandbob,19/04/2023,The site is very basic but close to the city centre. A 10 minute cycle. Only one toilet and shower for men which needs a good clean or refurbishment.
399458,2680887,3,DiogoSanches,19/04/2023,"Its a parking place nothing less nothing more.
Security 24h, haven't use the toilet or shower, since you are able to empty and fill up.
Close to city center and good for cycle"

399458,2677237,1,Antide,17/04/2023,I can't understand the positive reviews. You are standing in an open space in an industrial area where cars are constantly arriving and being delivered. Blazing sun and rather dirty. One camper next to the other. We didn't stay and went to a campsite nearby.
399458,2672351,3,Myleif,15/04/2023,"Easy access for large vehicles. Safe but unorganised and dirty. They don't accept credit cards, only cash. If you have a bike it's close to the city, but if you're going to take the bus you might as well choose a nicer place further away."
399458,2666277,4,mackay65,13/04/2023,"It is quite good, there is no shade, a good combination with the center, the surroundings of the area are very dirty and a lot of garbage, the premises are shared with a car sales company, security is fair, because they enter and leave without anything, there are no controls, I hope the company puts more measures Well, this Easter I have been and on Holy Thursday night they stole 4 cars from those who have the company and it is a pity"
399458,2665803,2,RM73,12/04/2023,The stars only for the location close to the Center of Seville. The toilets were really dirty. The trucks transporting the vehicles made a lot of noise and dust. Too bad there is only this area near the center.
399458,2665488,5,ViajantJunts,12/04/2023,"We have slept very well. It is very safe, at night they close the fence. 30m to Maria Luisa. 20 to Triana. 10 to Fair. Are there showers. It is not dirty, it is an area that is shared with a car sales, it is not beautiful but it breathes a calm and quiet atmosphere. Yes, it is true that there is a stretch of walking that we decided not to do at night due to lack of lighting. We definitely recommend."
399458,2665182,3,Vandiamo,12/04/2023,Great for larger motorhomes as lots of space. Good location to visit Seville on foot 40mins or by bike (excellent tracks)  It’s located within a car delivery company within the port so there’s lots of activity during the day Mon-Fri. It’s secure but industrial & the access road can be potholed & is unlit at night. We’ve experienced black dust from the port & there can be noise at night from it
399458,2662923,4,labarotte38,11/04/2023,"not too glamorous but secure and cycle path that passes in front. we went to see the other area on the other side of the gadalquivir, it's really not better or worse."
399458,2662845,4,Luckygaz,11/04/2023,"It was a perfect place to stop for a couple of days in the city,  we found it clean and tidy, although we only used the washing and drying machines, we did not use the bathrooms. We felt safe and had no worries about leaving our truck there.  It took us 25 minutes to walk into the city, there is an ALDI supermarket within an 8 minute walk."
399458,2662161,3,PituPitu,11/04/2023,"A simple parking lot. There was a problem with the electricity but it was finally fixed. We slept very peacefully. Quite a dirty but useful cistern for filling and draining water. About 30 minutes walk to the center. It is very close to the place where the ""Feria de Abril"" is celebrated."
399458,2661460,1,nondiknora,11/04/2023,painful a dirty place like sleeping in a dump the garbage overflows and stinking due to the high temperatures the bathrooms and showers a real pigsty. at any time of the day fifteen minutes walk from the center next to a shantytown and not recommended for walking at night the price is a robbery for what it offers
399458,2660353,1,mathieun64160,11/04/2023,catastrophic that's all
399458,2653486,3,travelbjoern,09/04/2023,A good place for the self-sufficient. €14/day including V&E (electricity €4/day extra). There is one shower/toilet for people who are undemanding. No daily rates as described in another comment. There is an ALDI at the roundabout in front of the parking space. The center can be reached by bike in 15-20 minutes.
399458,2653016,3,DavidIranzo,09/04/2023,"We liked that 24 hours a day there was staff monitoring entrances and exits. It has all the services but it is quite dirty and neglected. The worst is the access streets, especially at night with poor lighting, luckily the taxis arrive right at the door."
399458,2652416,4,EmelineMarty,09/04/2023,a very large site with plenty of space for motorhomes and campers. open 24 hours with all services. The only drawback to my taste is that it is a bit far from everything to walk with children.
399458,2651334,4,RRonTheWay,08/04/2023,"The place is called Area de Autocaravanas Sevilla and you can also reserve through the website. Very good if you are self-sufficient. Plus: Secure site with electricity, waste disposal, shower, toilet. You can reach the center of Seville in 15 minutes on bike paths or by bus. An Aldi is 5 minutes away. Restriction: only 1 toilet, 1 shower, often poor cleanliness. Very, very easy."
399458,2650731,3,alexandrearmez,08/04/2023,"Wing, if you can call it that, water services, electricity, bath and shower for everyone, always cold water. abandoned industrial area, very dirty, route to the center without any lighting. advantage has security 24 hours a day"
399458,2646906,5,avabela,07/04/2023,"An ideal place to get to know the city. A 25-minute walk from Plaza España, it is a pleasant walk (it is very close to the place where the April Fair is held) There are many ACs but we made the reservation online and it was easy to enter although we arrived very early (at 7 :30). It's roomy though but keep in mind to have an extension cord to use electricity."
399458,2646055,1,PayB,07/04/2023,"No receipt (not even when asked). The place is very large, campers park as they want, sometimes very close together. Everything was very carelessly and also dirty. Loud. reckless. Sorry - no recommendation!"

399458,2644851,4,debbiema10,06/04/2023,"This is a massive serviced car park. There are some EHU but they are on a first come first served basis.  We’ve counted over 150 vans/MoHo’s. You are definitely paying for the location just 20 mins walk to the city centre & at 14€ for the night it’s fine. It’s secure, quiet and the guy in reception is friendly and helpful.  I’ve given it 4 stars for the location the drive to it isn’t pretty."
399458,2642406,3,stef30129,05/04/2023,"Well located location. Town center close and accessible by bike. On the other hand, the area is a real gas factory. A lot of people, but nevertheless calm in the evening. Plan to pay only in cash. For the electrical connection it's 1st come, 1st served…The common sanitary facilities are…. Commons…."
399458,2639905,3,PabloAngulo,04/04/2023,"Few other options in the area. Free will motorhomes in part of a parking lot used to store new cars and rental companies. To get to us, the navigator made us enter a road marked prohibited except authorized, which we believe is the only option."

399458,2638645,1,luismoka,04/04/2023,"Very noisy car port loading cars, at night you have to walk through a road without light because they close the port fence and do not let taxis in"

399458,2634629,4,Sunliving22,02/04/2023,"Correct area, has filling and emptying. It is located 30 minutes from downtown and 15 minutes from Plaza España. The site is not the most beautiful but it is good to visit Seville. If I were to return, I would almost certainly repeat in this same place."
399458,2633224,4,Perlimpimpin,01/04/2023,ideally located for visiting Seville. Take your bikes if you have them. It's awesome !!!
399458,2631785,1,tomillosax,31/03/2023,"Very dirty area, my ugly one, located in the port with vehicle purchase and sale businesses. The girl who serves you is slow and doesn't have a clue about anything. Only 2 points of light so if you want light or get a place nearby or carry a huge hose. emptying and filling area dirty and isolated. It saves him that it is Seville and walking takes 25 minutes to Plaza España."
399458,2630554,3,LaurentDesplas,30/03/2023,"Perfect for visiting Seville with bikes! It is a large motorhome parking lot, not very user-friendly (but we are there to visit) and which is guarded and closed at night. A guard opens if you come in late. Perfect!"
399458,2629454,3,momoHenri,29/03/2023,"You have to be lucky when you want to sleep there. During my stay, there was a boat in the merchant port which is just in front of the area and it made a lot of noise day and night. This area is in a car park where the main activity is the car trade, so there was a lot of traffic for this activity. A shower for women and one for men that are not very neat but which have the merit of existing but which you cannot close when there is a lot of traffic for the trade. Close to Seville especially by bike and Aldi at the main entrance across the road. 14€ plus electricity"

399458,2624454,5,biancadicugno,25/03/2023,The place is huge. It seems strange when you enter because it is very dark but it is super good and with all the services! Highly recommended since there is a lot of insecurity in Seville
399458,2623407,2,Trvl4fun,25/03/2023,Dirty and the staff seems to not want to help at all. Cold shower and dirty bathrooms. Hard to get in and out of facility when you want to head into town even by foot. They control all access if they are around
399458,2623285,2,alquimiastudio,25/03/2023,"The only good thing is that it is a 30-minute walk to the center, otherwise it has 1 shower with cold water and the bathrooms are totally unpleasant. Everything is dirty."

Car park ok & very close to the town centre- but found a lot of dog poo dotted about the car park & didnt feel over welcomed by the residents of the block of flats overlooking us - they kept staring at us from their balconies when we parked up & stayed for the night

Access is through a narrow, one-way street, so it is very difficult to get out of the way if another vehicle comes. Not recommended for campers and motorhomes over 6 meters. For the rest, the site is flat and quiet to spend the night and visit the town"
399540,3279816,5,marcguille,10/09/2023,Very good area. Nice town with wonderful people. Many bicycle and hiking routes. Next to the Ojos Negros greenway. Other towns would have to imitate them.

Thanks to the Geldo town hall for adapting this free area."
399540,3215824,2,godefridi,25/08/2023,Place where young people like to throw bombs at your car. There is a swimming pool nearby. The town is calm. But this place is not recommended.

399540,3187975,4,DavidBP81,20/08/2023,"Easy access, next to the sports center and municipal swimming pool. Wide, level squares and good services for filling water and emptying black and gray water. Interesting town of Geldo with its mural graffiti and its cultural offer. The only thing to improve is the lack of shade (still small trees) and that the platform for emptying gray water does not have enough slope towards the chest."

We always like to spend some euros in town at  this bar which was well fraternised by locals they clearly have 2 prices one for locals one for visitors 4euro for a glass of wine ! Most I have ever paid in Spain and I live here avoid this bar you are warned

If it weren't for the unbearable heat of the day we would have walked around the town to see all the works of art on the facades. 100% recommended"
399540,2865252,4,garrucha,17/06/2023,"Nice place and next to the town with a bakery and bars, the only drawback if I have to put any is that it does not have garbage cans. you have to go to the pool that is a little further down. It's not that it's far, but at night it's very dark as there are 2 streetlights and one is out. otherwise great. Thanks to the town hall."

But I put two stars for people who do not know how to respect the rules, have education and respect, since there were 4 or 5 motorhomes that went together and they took out chairs, tables, awnings, and even a barbecue, they put on music until so many and they talked to Screams. I would ask that this be controlled more, because it is a pity."

399540,2765757,1,fiorenza22,20/05/2023,"The area looks good. It's a pity that a group of about 6 or 7 motorhomes have made us have to leave at 2.30 AM after repeatedly telling them to shut up and turn down the music. The area is not surrounded by houses for there to be complaints, they have camped out with tables and chairs at ease because they know that nobody is passing by, not even the police. I sent them to them so they could join the party."
399540,2746649,5,robersaly,13/05/2023,"New and wonderful area for motorhomes, a very large area, more than 5 can fit but there is a permit only for 5.

The facilities were clearly marked & clean (better than the IKEA spot facilities).

We would have stayed if there was a few other vans. Seemed a shame to be so empty!"

399574,2656592,4,Kernigit,10/04/2023,"Decent spot close to nice town with good restaurants. Way better than the IKEA place in our opinion! One access road from the south was closed for works, so we had to approach from the north, but well signposted."
399574,2655522,2,remybailly,09/04/2023,"review the description because access is not obvious. Tarmac parking certainly but not really welcoming a little in the middle of nowhere, we left immediately. thanks anyway ."

399574,2645831,5,joshi_es,07/04/2023,"A very new and very clean area, for the moment. Very wide with many places. We have spent the day and the night super quiet. Walking to the city is a moment. Okay"
399574,2643736,3,protector,06/04/2023,The parking is great. Spacious. The service works great. But the dogs nearby are terribly whining and barking all night long.
399574,2635972,5,tourmat,02/04/2023,Very functional area on a specific tarmac car park for CC. Easy access to town. quiet out of season. Close to Murcia.

399574,2629443,5,ep1c.adv.23,29/03/2023,"Clean, flat and safe overnight stopover. Shopping centre with toilets just 200m away. The address took us down the road, but if you look on your satellite map you can clearly see the motor home stop over area."
399574,2629372,4,rvanvugt,29/03/2023,"A big tarmacked parking with officially 32 bays for campervans and even two waterstations, but only one for disposal. They bays are quite tight, so when it becomes full, your neighbours are just 2m away. Now end of March there were only 6- 12 campervans, but as you can on the 1st picture, it may be full during the popular wintermonths. Easy access to Via Verde and close to the Rio Segura. Thanks!"
399574,2622573,5,avespaman,24/03/2023,"Perfect and quiet place, clean and new. You can visit the orchard. We went just to spend a weekend and eat at LA MAITA Restaurant, I recommend it."

399574,2617454,5,Dariods92,20/03/2023,"Very comfortable asphalt video surveillance area. Services are 100% functional. The town is equipped with everything. On Saturdays there is also the market, excellent for buying fruit and vegetables at a good price. At 600m it is possible to take the bus to Murcia, Ayutamiento stop, the cost is €2."
399574,2612068,3,anitaludo,17/03/2023,"A nice motorhome, but only at night the dogs that bark and howl. And there are only a few small trash cans. When we arrived there was still a large garbage can, but they have come to remove it. Therefore only 3 stars."
399574,2608102,5,LuchiLiu,13/03/2023,"Very good area. It is essential to visit the Mudem museum, the different waterwheels and chimneys that exist and eat at the La Maita restaurant. This town has very good shops. I recommend the bakery ""la subirana"", with organic bread baked in a wood oven. It also has the greenway and the riverbank to walk. Thanks to the town hall for a place like this!!!"
399574,2607539,5,Ravic83,12/03/2023,"Very good location, close to the center and good connection to go out by bike on the greenway. A few meters away you can catch frequent buses to visit Murcia"

399580,3183509,5,jotajz,19/08/2023,"Good place, next to the beach and spacious, in summer during beach hours it costs 2 euros but at night it is very quiet, a 15-minute walk along the promenade from the area of bars and hotels"
399580,3152007,4,kathrischa,15/08/2023,"A bit tricky to find the entrance for the rear parking lot below. The entrance for the larger cars and WoMos is pretty much at the middle chiringuito. There are also permanent campers. The place is a bit littered. You are very protected at the back and far enough away from the road. Is all in all in order, we felt comfortable."
399580,3076095,4,AnniMika,04/08/2023,"The place is very convenient for one night. You can walk comfortably on the promenade in the evening and there are many restaurants. However, it is also quite noisy until late at night. Yes, you can refuse to pay the two euros, but I don't find it tragic to pay €2, after all the guys stand there in the heat all day and are really happy if you give the €2."
399580,2888408,5,champihymer,24/06/2023,"Quiet place in front of the beach, no services, totally free and many motorhomes."
399580,2852613,2,Bessi20,14/06/2023,Better to choose the place to the right of this one. In our opinion it is much louder here (road and air traffic) otherwise good location by the sea. Toilets and showers available.
399580,2802388,5,Ambrogio90s,30/05/2023,"Ample parking in front of the beach, clean, but construction works next to it, not too noisy. Bars, restaurant and services available on the beach. Slept two night and left the car parked here for a few days during the weekend due to other urgent matters we had to attend, had absolutely no issues."
399580,2785928,3,maxiundfrannyundbalu,25/05/2023,In itself a very comfortable place. The area is full of tourists and has a Lignano (Italy) flair. We stayed there for 2 nights because we had to. Otherwise there are really nicer places! Air travel is very disturbing if you are a light sleeper!
399580,2771589,5,C.owen,21/05/2023,had 1 night here no problems whilst staying here..
399580,2675681,4,DieSchirmis,16/04/2023,"In itself a good big place on the beach and promenade. Are professionally dressed and give you a ticket. You can use the shower on the beach. Very busy, very busy and lots of campers!"
399580,2650716,5,Berbel01,08/04/2023,A great pitch for the night. Spent two nights. Beware of the scammers who charge 2 euros for parking. They don't even guard the vehicles where you could at least say it was worth money.
399580,2646275,4,ElectroBaer,07/04/2023,"(VW T5) Large parking lot, only separated from the beach by a promenade and a small road. Stood here 3 nights, lots of motorhomes but found the atmosphere pleasant. There are toilets and showers on the beach."

399586,2702030,2,migsonnawywczasie,27/04/2023,"The parking is just next to the fabrics, no campers there, the strange people hanging around. We dod not feel safe and went on to another destination."

399719,2814337,3,caito,03/06/2023,Sorry for the comment. I feel obliged to give my opinion for the good of all. The area is very good. He sleeps peacefully. The problem is that it is an unhealthy place for two reasons. They fumigate in the next field while the motorhomes are parked. Nobody does anything. We had to close doors and windows. High power power lines and noisy transformers.

399719,2607059,5,Mencica,12/03/2023,"Excellent bet of the council to promote tourism in the town. Town with two cores where you can find places to eat tapas and restaurants (they can be found on the town hall website).

The people from the village come on the weekend and it fills up but during the week we are almost alone. The place is a bit dirty from those who come to spend the day and leave bottles and garbage, but otherwise it's great.

By 6 it was very full with campervans. Expecting trash to be worse after reviews but not too crazy, enjoy the sound of waves and amazing sunset. Apolonia supermarket a 10 min walk & a little sushi bar overlooking the beach when you head left a couple of rocks over."

Loved the park but was disappointed to see lots of rubbish especially toilet paper all around the walking tracks. Please take all rubbish with you! There is also a toilet at the supermarket 10min walk away."

400053,3228220,5,AnnaBel35,27/08/2023,"Beautiful place! On the other hand very few places, 4 real places, otherwise you have to park along the road, therefore on a slope, the chocks are mandatory. The place downstairs very beautiful, not too crowded despite the month of August. No services."

Only downside the papers and waste in all the bushes, please respect the places!"
400053,3201341,5,JessicaAmbrosi,22/08/2023,"quiet parking, few places, possibility to sleep without problems but only with ocean noise. Partial beach access and stunning coastal views. no services but a 10-minute walk from restaurants and shops. Space for about 10 vans/cars. little maneuvering space for campers over 4mt. let's keep the area clean!"
400053,3196854,5,edcVWT6,21/08/2023,"Spectacular place. Ideal for watching the sunset, and extremely quiet to spend the night. We spent one night together with 5 other vans. It has a small container to deposit the garbage."
400053,3170856,4,_freewheeler,18/08/2023,"spectacular! small area of land with good access where you can sleep next to the beach, arrive early to park, at night it fills up with campers. We have spent a very quiet night, only the sound of the sea. There is garbage, with collection in the morning. too bad all the papers and dirt behind the bushes, keep clean!"
400053,3168421,4,gallardo94,17/08/2023,"Ideal place to watch the sunset. The pity is that it is a small space, only a few vans or caravans fit and we had to sleep on an esplanade that was just above the road that leads to this area."
400053,3166953,5,davidgm1986,17/08/2023,"We spent one of the quietest nights, a place of 10 to sleep, there was some other van in the middle of August, not a noise"

400053,3110910,5,Francs92,09/08/2023,"Charming pitch, quiet and facing the sea! There are few places, the ideal is to arrive when those who have had the day go home"
400053,3097717,5,Kennysrk,07/08/2023,"Good spot, a lot of vans in August so difficult to have one of the four places in front of the sea but the large car park above offers beautiful scenery if you find the right place. Rather calm at night and the wind coming from the sea is well appreciated in the Algarve."
400053,3087486,4,Raycofurgo,06/08/2023,"Very good place to spend the day and night, very quiet, about 6 to 8 vans fit. A restaurant 2 minutes away with paid bathrooms and showers (€1). With some spectacular coves, I recommend it 100%."

400053,3078307,4,happycamper18,04/08/2023,"Great for a night or two. Access to 2 small beaches. Or larger ones with a restaurant where you could probably take a shower. At first there were 3 of us, but in the evening there were 13 other campers who somehow squeezed in. Local residents weren't very happy about it. The place is super dusty and no showers here either"
400053,3068098,5,Sab1031,03/08/2023,"A magnificent spot to spend the night and admire the sunset, right by the ocean. We spent a rather quiet night there in a van (when our neighbor finally decided to cut his music…). There is just a trash can on site but you can shower in the restaurant next door (1€) and use the toilets. The staff there is super friendly!"
400053,3057030,5,luciajisa,01/08/2023,"Spectacular site, we spent the night with other campers and motorhomes without problem! Recommended 100%. 2 min walk from the beach where you can watch the sunset! ☀️"

To the left access to another small path (2 min walk) leading to a very pretty and very good restaurant with a view of the coast, magnificent! WCs available in the restaurant and showers for €1 for around 2min. Very friendly restaurant staff."
400053,2996810,3,vixxn,21/07/2023,"Absolutely amazing place & beautiful beach! The first night went smoothly, on the second day the police came at noon and sent away all the cars and campers. Apparently you're not allowed to park so close to a coast. You can use the parking lot in front of the entrance. There it was no problem to stand & also suggested by the police."
400053,2967752,5,pan6ea,15/07/2023,"Stunning spot to spend the night. As previous people mentioned, you should arrive quite early to get a spot overviewing the beach and the sea. GNR stopped by in the morning to check the site but they didn’t say anything and left rather quickly. Please don’t litter this beautiful spot."
400053,2952388,5,cloudrap,12/07/2023,"No prohibition signs for camping. There is space for 6/7 vans or campers. We stayed 2 nights with the van and we loved it, it's very clean and quiet, the beaches that are under the car park are beautiful and uncrowded. Beautiful view."

400053,2910979,5,vanningwilder,01/07/2023,"One of the few remaining spots with no signs that restrict overnight parking. Clean up after yourself, there was trash on the ground from campers. We stayed 3 days with no issues. There’s a great restaurant called Praia Lorurenco that has a shower, €1 / 2.5 minutes. Great for a beer or coffee in the shade!"
400053,2903801,5,AR158,29/06/2023,Wonderful pitch with an insanely great view! From the pitch itself you can see the sea and right next to it is a beautiful bay. We were able to enjoy the most beautiful sunset in the Algarve here. Absolute recommendation!
400053,2885559,5,Donaldinio,24/06/2023,Great very small car park day and night. Thanks to the community inde that there are still places like this in Portugal. Please leave the space as you arrived!
400053,2876910,4,Reiziger14,21/06/2023,"Nice place, there are some straight and some sloping pitches. No guarantee there will be room, it was busy last night.

400053,2849793,5,SimoneParkt,13/06/2023,"Nice place for a quiet night with a nice view. However, there are only a few parking spaces, the right timing is crucial here (after the day guests, before the overnight guests). A little above there is another parking lot where you can stand if necessary."
400053,2849681,5,fluxkiks,13/06/2023,"Great spot! We arrived around 6:30 p.m., there was already 1 van. 30 min later we were 5, do not hesitate to anticipate! We spent 2 nights, with the sound of the waves. You can observe a great sunset and swim down a small path barely 1 min walk."

400053,2825221,5,NadineHai,06/06/2023,We spent 3 very quiet nights here. The place is beautiful! From there you can also make great hikes through the area and to the bays worth seeing. The GNR came by every day to check on things. After our third night she asked all campers to vacate the site by evening.

400053,2815319,5,Julez0803,03/06/2023,"Wonderful place right by the sea, which is very rare in the Algarve. But please: WoMos that have to drive in backwards because they are so long can stay at the top of the parking lot (100m more. Beach doesn't matter), take your toilet paper with you (there's even a trash can!!) & park like that Locals still have space, otherwise it would soon be over with the place!"
400053,2814887,5,LorraineundManuel,03/06/2023,Super nice place with access to the beach and one of the few where you can still stand on the cliffs.

400055,3283558,2,erbert38,11/09/2023,"Area closed on 10/9 when we arrived due to local festivals on the esplanade which adjoins the service area. so we settled down at the back of the park opposite the area by the river, in the shade of the trees. it helps out all the more since the area does not have a shady corner. The pleasant town to visit is about 30 minutes on foot through a pretty park and a cycle path."

The bathrooms are a bit dirty. At 1:00 p.m. they invalidated the machine because there was a fair nearby but they didn't warn us, we found out by chance and we had to take the car out of the premises."

We have had to spend the night outside, and not only us, but several fires and cars, but I want to think that it was a coincidence and that it is usually there for your use. By the way, beautiful area, we will enjoy it another time"
400055,3222613,4,Gurutz,26/08/2023,"Great facility. We had problems with the tickets because the machine ran out of paper. Instead of paper, this code system should be mobile... It will be free in 2023, maybe even in 2024..."

400055,3200438,4,cocosilla,22/08/2023,"All services and free. They should simplify the entry machine, people leave without checking out, with which there are places that appear as occupied, the same with the electricity hookups. Merida must pay for it as soon as possible, because as always of a few, not all of us take care of the facilities and whatever happens, they will end them. Thanks Merida."
400055,3188625,5,Nilma,20/08/2023,"Good area with complete water services. In addition to light. Everything was free. Very hot. Being new, the trees did not provide shade, but outside of the hot months it will be extraordinary. Sure we repeat."
400055,3187425,4,isabelleseig,20/08/2023,"The best thing is the public swimming pool, a 3-minute walk away (3 or 4 euros per adult) with grass, showers and a bar."
400055,3186090,5,pouhin,20/08/2023,"Very good place, free, all services, new, however care must be taken to keep it new."
400055,3177499,5,velilla2023,18/08/2023,"Totally recommended, spacious and new"
400055,3175443,5,crichu98,18/08/2023,"Finally an Area in which even if you have to pay it will not be exaggerated and which more people can enjoy. It is sad but necessary to start implementing payment systems because people who stay parked fortnights like in the Gijón area will end up paying everyone and I almost prefer it, and that says 72h Max, let's see who regulates that. My congratulations to the city council of Mérida."
400055,3172565,5,MarcoPVaz,18/08/2023,"An excellent Asa, all free until the end of 2023. We have to get a ticket but nothing out of this world. It has water, sewage and electricity, and WC with showers. For maintenance you need a different ticket, and for the WC also a ticket."
400055,3163464,4,adpetrum,16/08/2023,Great area with very wide and level squares (highly recommended) It's a 10/15min walk from the center and 5min from Mercadona For now it's free but only for 2023. We'll see what prices they put later I don't give 5 stars because of the ticket issue. It's a pain in the ass to have to be getting tickets for each service. The way to recharge clean water and throw black is a bit tedious.
400055,3153397,5,jksn31790,15/08/2023,"Super quiet free area….water electricity emptying free shower large pitches thanks to the municipality of Merida. Deserves 6 stars!!! I recommend. You just have to register at the entrance, nothing to complicate, it's in several languages."
400055,3145195,4,mobilvetamalembe,14/08/2023,"free area with electricity, filling, emptying, bathroom and shower. there was a laundry room that we didn't use. Located next to the river and a park with lots of vegetation and areas for children. very nice. In the parking lot there were free spaces but the machine said that everything was occupied, so many ac stayed out overnight. You can book online and it's free, maybe that's the reason."
400055,3142705,5,muakiti,14/08/2023,"The facilities are phenomenal, we spent a night and half a day totally free. We use the showers and drinking water. When you enter you register, I recommend taking out the tickets that you are going to use (several showers xa use the WC tb) already at that moment and that's it!"
400055,3142594,5,CarlosGuapi,14/08/2023,"Very good area, free for 72 hours. It has male and female bathrooms with showers. To enter you have to get a ticket, the machine is very intuitive. There is also electricity. To put a but, you have to get a free ticket to have water in the bathrooms. With emptying of gray water and there is no shade."
400055,3142518,5,Estersanzp,14/08/2023,"Free Merida area. It has a male shower room and a female shower room. Also free electricity socket at home plot. To enter you have to follow the instructions on the machine. Large, level pitches. Very good area."
400055,3130081,5,fernandoas,12/08/2023,"We thank the city council of Mérida for offering us this area for FREE motorhomes. Quiet area with emptying and filling, bathrooms, showers, and even electricity. 100% recommended, of course, and for those who say that it is difficult to understand the machine at the entrance, just tell them that you have to read and follow the steps."
400055,3126309,5,manou_6464,12/08/2023,"Quiet, clean, secure place!!! Provide identity papers for check-in at the terminal. Free parking for the first 72 hours, as well as electricity (we didn't use the others). The train passes not far but not at night, and the day passes at low speed not disturbing. I highly recommend."
400055,3119908,5,vivie29,11/08/2023,"Very nice area, all services and free for the first 72 hours. Clean showers, very quiet for the night. A train passes not very far away but you can hardly hear it during the day and not at all at night. Only small negative point is the complexity of the ticket system to access the services. You have to be patient to complete all the necessary elements at the terminal in order to obtain your free tickets!"
400055,3084671,5,PhilippeMagaud,05/08/2023,very good area. Not always easy for the terminal. Advice to register with the license plate to have access to the ticket for the opening of the gate. For other services take the free tickets at the terminal. secure and clean parking. To advice.
400055,3084638,4,GaizkaVan,05/08/2023,"It's a new area, it will have to be found and paid for. An ideal place to see the city, because it is far from the center and quiet. There are municipal slopes next door if you want."
400055,3075580,2,fabiennemoyet,04/08/2023,"very nice area. Only super painful to have a ticket to go to the toilet, another to access the showers (and even when it works or there is water), one to leave the car park, one for electricity, a to fill up with water and finally one for the toilet cassette. it's nonsense, and sometimes the hygiene leaves something to be desired. Too bad if not close to the city"
400055,3073330,5,Mariuge,04/08/2023,Perfect area to rest. Well designed. For the moment free. We thank the City Council for the initiative and trust that it will establish reasonable prices.
400055,3065841,5,leiremclouis,02/08/2023,"The area is very, very good, very spacious, good access, level and at the moment it is free. Access is somewhat difficult, you have to register on the machine and too much data and everything digitized, and of course you have to return to the machine because something is missing. And the mosquitoes, they have come to this area all over the world, what a barbarity."
400055,3062797,5,AnaEsther,02/08/2023,"Very good when you find out how it goes. You register, then you request parking, light, shower and he gives you the ticket and you can use it. Attention when registering: you can stay up to 3 days and I, for not occupying a place without being sure, put 1 and then I could no longer renew because it goes with the registration. To know... After 8:00 p.m. the door closes and if you don't register your stay, you don't go in or out."
400055,3060119,5,manelpm,01/08/2023,"Incredible!! all free and the best shower. Thanks to the city council of Merida. I hope more cities follow suit. Thanks, I'll be back."
400055,3054195,5,AlexMarcos,31/07/2023,everything very well very quiet area and with the city center a 10-minute walk away very well recommended place
400055,3053289,5,FranLdV,31/07/2023,"Very good. Very calm. children's park nearby. At the moment all free. Good light power, charges batteries very quickly. The shower only in the women's bathroom and with water for 15 minutes both hot and cold."
400055,3039949,5,ameiga,29/07/2023,"Everything free, hot water, bathrooms, parking, light, quiet. Super good, I wish I had more eggs like this."
400055,3021009,5,amrtrigano,25/07/2023,"For now everything is free. Close to visit the city on foot. We did it with a baby and stroller. It is next to the fairgrounds. On Tuesday they put on the market but it has not been noticed or that they have come early. Hopefully many cities in Mérida will take an example, which you cannot miss. Is beautiful."
400055,3018486,5,aliciarv,25/07/2023,"quiet, free until 72h with services, very close to the center, perfect for visiting Mérida"
400055,2995965,5,bikefire,21/07/2023,"Automatic area similar to those of Ciudad Real, Castilla la Mancha. Correct operation and easy to use, sometimes it does not read foreign license plates well. NOW Everything is free but the cost is usually €6 for an overnight stay, €3 for a water change and €3 for WC-Showers. This area is very wide and is next to the fairgrounds, level squares and 2.5km from the center. Easy access. Recommended ok"
400055,2994118,5,dasafru,20/07/2023,"The area is very good, everything new. The problem is being able to enter, which is not intuitive."
400055,2956855,4,quequi,13/07/2023,"Area with all services, for now free until January (this as a test), not a shadow. 20 minutes from downtown."
400055,2948183,4,echeokhai,10/07/2023,"The facilities are new and there are plenty of places, electricity and easy and free filling and emptying, there are tables with benches, the showers are good and free BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO SPRAY THERE ARE MANY BUGS, THERE ARE ALSO LEAKS. Five minutes away there is a municipal swimming pool with grass around it, adult entrance 3.15."
400055,2933515,5,Paluda,07/07/2023,super area with all services
400055,2910453,3,JAUMEGRACIA,01/07/2023,"The area is very good, it's a pity about the party that some of them set up in the lot next door until 4 in the morning. Let's call the police but wow...they didn't even come close. And at two in the morning a truck came in to unload a motorhome without any kind of consideration for the rest."
400055,2910008,4,bertip,01/07/2023,"It is a good free area with all services and a 10-minute walk from the center. It lacks shade and tonight there was a bottle next door with loud music, but during the week it seems to be quiet. Recommended to stop!"
400055,2904218,5,fidelmartel,29/06/2023,"Spectacular area, with all services, congratulations Merida!!!"
400055,2902532,5,MSchollbach,28/06/2023,"Great parking space with a short way to the beautiful city of Merida. You can gain access if you register on site at the terminal with your ID card. Parking lot is monitored. It's stupid that you can't check out if you leave early. In the event of early departure, the pitch remains active for the registered person and cannot be used by anyone else."
400055,2888781,4,rimortxo,24/06/2023,Thanks Merida. Good facilities close to the city. The only thing missing is for the trees to grow so that we have shade.
400055,2887586,5,Biak,24/06/2023,"Free area with all services: electricity, emptying and filling and free showers and toilets available. Good access to the historic center to visit the city on foot. We showed up without a reservation and there were plenty of free places."
400055,2873864,3,Petercoyote,20/06/2023,If you want to know what is a UX and what their job can be useful to society just visit this area
400055,2862663,5,pocasfuerzas,17/06/2023,"Very good facilities, silent, with all the necessary services and free."
400055,2858441,5,olias8888,15/06/2023,We stayed here for one night. Easy registration at the gate. All services can be booked free of charge with one ticket. The booking logic could be improved. There were occupied places where nobody was standing. The electricity didn't work in our place. It was easy to book and get the power from the seat next to it though. Showers were clean.
400055,2840190,4,guiry,10/06/2023,"Very good motorhome site. We stayed outside the fenced area, there is plenty of room, thanks to the Merida town hall. The town is wonderful and worth visiting, we were there on Saturday June 3 and there was a Roman festival, we loved it."
400055,2833042,5,Sccf,08/06/2023,"quiet location with all the necessary services. the entrance should have been for hours and not for days, as there were several places free of motorhomes that had already left, but could not enter anymore. in our place the electricity did not work"
400055,2832795,4,YvesDomi,08/06/2023,"Excellent idea of the municipality that we thank for this period of free. Some areas for improvement: a squeegee available in the toilets would allow you to leave the place clean, increase the number of toilets, be able to go out and return with your vehicle during the day without losing your rights. These are only details as long as it's free but it will change everything once paid."
400055,2831156,4,Izas1207,08/06/2023,"Highly recommended, all services work perfectly. The negative side is that there are occupied plots and there is never anyone. You just have to be a little careful."
400055,2831143,4,tine21,08/06/2023,"Great free space. The booking system has its pitfalls, but if you just do what the machine asks for (ID number, etc.) it works well. The city is within walking distance. We found it very good here. The only thing that needs improvement is the toilet and shower. You need a new code from the machine each time. A bit tedious. But otherwise top notch."
400055,2829995,1,adrlana,07/06/2023,"cannot be accessed, the app does not work."
400055,2821983,5,FranklinSoares,05/06/2023,Download the app to make a reservation for a spot :)
400055,2821322,1,Furpolaris,05/06/2023,"Several empty spaces and the application indicates that everything is complete, I spend the night out together with several ACs and at 7 in the morning the same empty spaces continue"
400055,2812086,5,charbertua,02/06/2023,"Incredible place!! bathrooms, showers, electricity, all services. You just have to pay attention to how to use them. the historic center 20 minutes walk. Thank you Merida!!!"
400055,2811253,5,RaulMaria12,02/06/2023,"Perfect motorhome area, read the signs well to understand it. Thanks to the town hall for giving us this area!!"
400055,2805206,5,Prinana,31/05/2023,"Excellent Aire. Great facilities. Spotlessly clean. 
Rocked up without booking. Used the panel screen available in many languages. Reserved 1 night but forgot to add shower/ water services.Easy enough to add later.
noticed you could just use services,which gives you 1hr if you needed a pit stop to empty and replenish water.
Very quiet. slept well. Nice to sees variety of MoHos   vintage campers."
400055,2803599,5,PilarSaiz,30/05/2023,"Good closed area for motorhomes, easy handling of all the facilities, you just have to read the signs with the instructions well and get a ticket to use showers, emptying gray, black and filling. Thank you Mérida City Hall for giving us these services."
400055,2802613,5,joke64,30/05/2023,"The machine is easy to operate and can be set in various languages, including Dutch. In principle, you only need to register your car. After registering you can turn on the power for your place. For toilet/shower you have to 'buy' a ticket. And that is also necessary for the chemical toilet. Perhaps cumbersome, but understandable."
400055,2800642,5,Lorreen,29/05/2023,"Great free place within cycling distance of the historic center. Just find out how the machine works, but then you have everything you need for free and for nothing."
400055,2800250,2,cdulbecco,29/05/2023,The area will be paid. for now it's free but the administration is a mess you have to select the position but the electricity doesn't necessarily match. a ticket is drawn to go to the bathroom or take a shower. also another ticket to change waters. everything is annoyingly confusing and complicated. the only salvageable thing is the size of the plots and their relative proximity to the measurement center.
400055,2799013,5,Greygappers,29/05/2023,"OK first and foremost this is a great Aire. The community are providing an excellent place to park and an easy walk to the town and its sights.

That said the booking system is awful. This is in part due to the fact the Aire is free at the moment and there is an incentive to book for three days even if you only stay one or two. This means there are unoccupied spaces that are marked as occupied."
400055,2796882,5,DCLJ,28/05/2023,"for free. Shower is hot, all services work perfectly. Check-in also uncomplicated. everything is digital, fast and secure. The location is great near parks and the river. 1.5km to town. Some noise from trains and noisy cars at night"
400055,2795831,5,jetxeroman,28/05/2023,Motorhome area with all services 15 minutes walk from the center of Mérida. Positive: Large paved and level plots. Gray and black waters. toilets. showers. Enclosure closed. Negative: Lack of shade. Automated access a bit confusing. It is currently free but will become paid. Although it will still be worth it. Thank you Merida!! Let's see if the rest is learning...
400055,2794806,5,silviapenachao,28/05/2023,"area of 10 and even above free until 12/31/23 all services, including free electricity. very spacious and closed farm. Don't trust the reservation on the web... Yesterday it told me that there were no places available for today and half is free. touch screen at the entrance if you are involved and do not know, there is a tfn at the entrance that will guide you how to do everything (24/365). I don't know how there are people who object"
400055,2794092,4,C.owen,28/05/2023,"good stop and felt safe inside the area, shame locals were racing back and fore on gravel car park til quite late, doing handbrake turns ect...
does need a separate toilet and shower as only 1 for women and 1 for men.."
400055,2792628,5,Manusalmar,27/05/2023,"Free area, fenced, with security cameras. Silent. Excellent. Thanks to the town hall."
400055,2790716,3,Patrick5735,27/05/2023,Thank you to the city for this free parking; a little complicated to use the services offered; the electrical terminal 12 was not working but impossible to change places because of the choice of location. Very easy to get to the historic center: very beautiful city!!!
400055,2789109,4,leopardventure,26/05/2023,"We are delighted and thanks to the town hall for making such an area with water and electricity, at night with light and very quiet. The bathrooms could be a little cleaner but everything is fine."
400055,2786415,5,JLPicard,26/05/2023,"Top place with automatic system via terminal. All services available. Attention: the place is no longer free! Unfortunately, the automatic system does not always release the spaces even though the vehicle is already out. In front of the square is a huge gravel area for parking."
400055,2784131,5,cathy-alain,25/05/2023,"Free area with drinking water, electricity, gray water and black water drainage. Perfectly suited for any type of motorhome. Clean and quiet. Located 20 minutes walk from the tourist sites of the city. A train track is close but not too disturbing. I particularly recommend this car park and thank the municipality for making it available to motorhomes."
400055,2781245,5,aixucamper,24/05/2023,"Many thanks to the town hall, it is a luxury to have completely free facilities. Very quiet place and quite close to the center. We have been lucky that the electricity has worked for us, because some points were damaged and to put a point, the showers were quite dirty, they should leave a bucket with a mop for users to clean once they finished using them."
400055,2780363,4,elrocio,24/05/2023,"Very good car park, but whoever designed it had fun (too complicated) risk of expensive breakdowns and easy to fool"
400055,2779158,4,eljubilao,23/05/2023,"Great new area, we hope it lasts a long time thanks to the Mérida city council for the services... (he pointed out the disorder of the users, they take one square and move to another and then the troubles arrive)."
400055,2775172,4,DPF,22/05/2023,"Great and clean area with all services. At the moment free, the same is the reason for the lack of control that exists in the access. Close to walk to the center and visit the city."
400055,2772056,5,Wohlmobil22,21/05/2023,"This parking space is currently completely free of charge - shower, electricity, toilet - water emptying of gray and black water."
400055,2758528,4,waikikinahi,18/05/2023,"Adequate area to stop in Merida. The bad thing is that to access the bathroom or shower you have to take a ticket at the entrance. We tried to book online, it told us that everything was busy but when we arrived there were many free places. In general, a very pleasant and quiet place to visit the city."
400055,2755967,3,Barcobird,17/05/2023,"Yes at the moment it’s free, let’s see how the rating changes when you pay!! The machine is challenging, sometimes a queue with people, motorhomes or both. A ticket is needed to flush the toilet which a lot of people don’t. There are only two his and hers with showers, not kept particularly clean. gate is continually left open for anyone to walk in. 10 min walk to town. Train runs along the back!"
400055,2751103,4,girox,15/05/2023,"Area with online booking system or directly on site (recommended directly on the Web through AreasPLA). Unfortunately in Merida everything is always busy. The toilets and showers can also be used by campers who park outside the area, in the adjacent car park just beyond the fence. For emptying it is the same: registration and withdrawal of a ticket valid for one hour. Free"
400055,2749627,3,jjrl,14/05/2023,"Complicated instructions for entering the area. It's a lottery if you arrive and can enter. I think it can be done easier. We had to spend the night outside the area until the next day that we continued our trip. A pity, because if we had been able to enter the area, surely we would have visited Mérida."
400055,2744681,5,venenosuper8,12/05/2023,"A very, very good place to spend the night and take out your seats. It's free until December. Clean showers, electricity, water, all free. To repeat."
400055,2733865,5,mvgm,08/05/2023,"A spectacular free area, congratulations to the city council of Mérida. The pity is that there are few places and, of course, they are in high demand. We have spent the night outside the area and ok. Recommended to visit the city."
400055,2731020,5,rosealain,07/05/2023,"Thank you to the municipality for having created this place, very convenient to go shopping and especially to visit this pretty city and its historic heart, its magnificent Roman theater, the temple of Diana and its museum of Roman arts, really very interesting, we let's keep this very good address, thank you Mr Mayor"
400055,2728986,5,IVECAMPER,06/05/2023,"Great, with all the services, clean, quiet, easy to get to and manage the entrance to the venue through the machine they have outside"
400055,2728559,4,llewi,06/05/2023,"Good concept, sunset, safe, supermarket, Aquaduct 20min walk. Youths at night race cars nearby did not disturb us, local cyclists and walkers. entry system easy, need passport, 1hr ticket & vehicle access for showers, dump, water. Shower 15min. one large toilet with shower each m&f. No shower curtain, hooks, ceiling leak in womens. Pedestrian security gate unlocked 24/7, broke? Overall good,clean"
400055,2728321,3,cmanton,06/05/2023,"Superb free area, but no shade. trowel There was no water in the toilets. The real availability does not correspond to what appears neither in the App nor in the external machine. Perfect for visiting the city."
400055,2726458,5,Joserram,05/05/2023,"Magnificent site with all services. In the heart of the city, a Mercadona 150 meters away. Large and perfectly level squares. The only but at the moment is the registration in the little machine, although it is intuitive, many things need to be explained. When you arrive for the first time, yes or yes, you get involved until a charitable soul comes to explain everything to you. area of 10"
400055,2726345,4,mmherm,05/05/2023,"Which of course is nice, free of charge at the moment. Accessing or booking the parking space at the terminal is a challenge. You have to book a ticket for the individual services. With the barcode you can unlock the toilet, for example. Only then can you rinse off and wash your hands. The toilet bowl looks the same. In the place you can easily go by bike. supermarket near."
400055,2722647,4,juanbis92,04/05/2023,"To visit Merida it is the perfect place, it is 15 minutes from the center, the facilities are very good. It has the train tracks nearby but at night none pass."
400055,2721618,4,luismiguelpascual,04/05/2023,"exemplary clean level area and all services. The only thing to improve is that when you select an AC, the stay cannot be canceled and another user cannot enter until the theoretical stay ends, there is AC outside waiting while there is room inside and empty spaces."
400055,2712428,5,Estatu,01/05/2023,"Fantastic: spacious, quiet and with all the services. Free if you stay less than 72 hours. Automatic registration at the entrance Thanks to the Ayto de Merida."

400055,2706919,5,Xerardo,29/04/2023,"Exceptional, the best area in which we have been. Many thanks to the Merida City Council for being sensitive to our way of doing tourism. It would not hurt to charge a small fee so that areas like these can be maintained, which are not abundant."
400055,2703715,5,Chantal33,28/04/2023,"Great area thanks to the city. All free until the end of December and limited to 72 hours. Big flat and I confirm the previous remarks, the entrance terminal is a gas plant. last name first name e-mail address postal address choose a location. if someone has booked 72 hours and left before you will not be able to return. Saw the almost empty area and ccs waiting outside at night. System to review."
400055,2702824,5,luisferbo52,28/04/2023,"Fantastic, you register when you arrive and choose the free plot, today many free places, I take the 13 and the floor with papers, it hurts, the trash can is next to it"
400055,2700813,5,IsidroSantana,27/04/2023,"Spectacular and in case it does not have capacity you can spend the night outside and take advantage of its shower and gray water emptying and water filling services, taking out the tikes in the machine that is there at the entrance"
400055,2699487,2,pothimobil,26/04/2023,"The electronic entry system is the worst we have ever seen. Many places remain empty because many motorhome owners drive on frustrated because they can't get in. We only managed to get to the site with the help of the telephone hotline. Otherwise: flat pitches, central location but no shade."
400055,2697634,3,janouck,26/04/2023,"The place is quiet and free, near the city center to visit the monuments, however the operation of the access is automated: to be able to enter it you have to press ""strongly on the keys"" for it to work. We weren't able to get water because the device couldn't read the ticket code, too bad..."
400055,2696934,5,Cmdpeter,25/04/2023,"Fantastic place. To drive in just follow the instructions. French, Dutch, German,.. can simply be selected. You only have to enter your details, indicate the location in green and hopla gate opens. Everything is provided, free for max 72h, then you have to pay. May there be more of these places."
400055,2696931,5,artanbrego,25/04/2023,super good and nice place. an example of how it should be everywhere. the entry procedure scares people off but is not at all difficult: just follow the explanation. this is an absolute must
400055,2695666,1,malc74,25/04/2023,"Looks good if you like being behind high wire fence, really difficult to enter because you first have to get past barrier impossible  without booking  avoid I would say"
400055,2692674,1,asor,24/04/2023,"Thanks to the town hall for facilitating this service. As NEGATIVE information, the instructions to access are NOT simple, it is very difficult to enter, even if there are free places. They have to review the operating system. We had to spend the night elsewhere."
400055,2691640,5,phiphi14740,23/04/2023,"Hello, Thank you to the municipality for this service area. We stocked up at the supermarket and had lunch in a nice little restaurant. We will come back. See you soon."
400055,2687133,5,jeandanielpatricia,22/04/2023,"Perfect. Entrance a little tricky the first time, but following the instructions, you get there. well maintained and quiet."
400055,2683678,4,jlacacho,20/04/2023,"Area very well equipped with bathrooms, showers, emptying and filling. Access is not complicated, just follow instructions. Tuesday market next to the area but they did not bother in the assembly. It's a pity that the square is not respected."
400055,2681986,5,peob,19/04/2023,"The pitch is first class. Entry only after registration with all data. For the time being, the parking space, showers, toilet, electricity and supply/disposal are free!!! About 27 paved and fenced pitches, illuminated at night. All sights within walking distance. Great discounts for over 65s. Taxi from Plaza Major to the parking space no € 4, - Highly recommended."
400055,2681707,5,dagall21,19/04/2023,A spectacular area. Congratulations to the city council for this initiative. All free services until the end of the year as it says. In a spectacular enclave. 100% recommendable.
400055,2675853,3,traveleca,16/04/2023,"A bit difficult to enter. Free until the end of the year. We have used only the services, everything new and clean but an ugly place... Many AC parked outside. The enclosed area inside has toilets, showers etc, but no shade. In summer it will be unbearable. Close to the center and a lot of space."
400055,2675662,5,gioia51,16/04/2023,"We too were there today as written below. ok we are Italian but honestly we don't understand the entry mechanism. We parked outside the network, many campers, even the civil guard passed by and said nothing. After the visit we left."
400055,2675385,1,Mutley952,16/04/2023,As others have said looks a well set up area but how you gain access is a mystery.  We did like everyone else and parked outside for the day and then went to find somewhere quieter for the night.  Shame such a nicely laid out and new site was half empty because of whatever the problem with gaining access is.  There were about 20 vans outside when we were there.
400055,2670900,1,happydolo,14/04/2023,"They have to make them look at it, it cannot be that we spend thirty ac outside the area and inside there are 12 free places, I do not see it ethical to reserve a place so as not to go and annoy other motorhome drivers"
400055,2665953,4,OvalCarpenter,12/04/2023,"Good site. Near the center. About 25 minutes walking. It is usually full, although there is also space to leave it outside and you can enter to use the sink and showers. The men's shower was not working."
400055,2663937,3,KATUMBI,12/04/2023,"Area very well set up but madness with so many people. What you have to do is call the phone there to say that you are leaving the square to benefit those who are waiting to enter..... 72 hours maximum stay that some extend it as it is free, thinking of others of course ...."
400055,2659389,1,osmoaz53,10/04/2023,"Positive: good appearance of the facilities. Negative: when we arrive half an empty area and impossibility of accessing a free space. They tell us that they are empty and the system gives them busy. We have called the helpline and they warn us that we are deserving of a sanction for entering without having a place, we explain that we have decided to enter and then get the ticket. We have gone."
400055,2659234,3,vadrouille72,10/04/2023,"ccar area, a bit complicated to enter even for just filling up and emptying. fortunately we can park next to the vacant lot, we were more than 100 outside 2 days ago."
400055,2657049,5,luissilva1971,10/04/2023,"excellent service area for motorhomes, congratulations to the city of Mérida for welcoming motorhomers so well. everything very clean, very quiet area and close to the center. a tour to repeat for sure top 5 stars"
400055,2657006,5,Kamubi,10/04/2023,"We have slept. Very large squares. Two emptying areas. Large clean toilets and showers. Quiet area, no noise, 20 min walk from the center. Outside there is a huge esplanade where you can park and use the bathroom and black water discharges. Free for now. The ticket system is not very intuitive, it is a matter of trial and error. There is a helpline. Very good option to visit Merida."
400055,2652035,4,viajamos,09/04/2023,"Good area to visit Merida. 15 minutes to the center. The departure system needs to be improved because there are free spaces and they are occupied. If you don't have a place, you can park outside next door and use the services in the area. Very good option in general. (I have not stayed overnight)."
400055,2651356,5,unbalconnoche,08/04/2023,"It is very good, but at Easter it was full and we had to go to another place. Well located, although you have to walk a bit to visit it."
400055,2648705,4,popemonica,08/04/2023,A pity that you can't say that you leave the area once you leave because the spaces appear as occupied even if they are empty. Outside there is a large esplanade where you can spend the night. Tickets are taken from the machine for use of the bathrooms and for filling and emptying. All free for now. You can go to the center on foot and in 20 minutes you can reach the theater and amphitheatre.
400055,2646317,4,gircuri,07/04/2023,"Public parking for caravans, is very good. There was no place inside, but outside there is a very large esplanade where you can park. It is close to the center, half an hour on foot. There is a river and park next to it. You can use the bathrooms, hot showers with a ticket, which is free until December."
400055,2646117,5,hymerB6441996,07/04/2023,"Free until December 2023, showers, bathrooms, emptying and filling of water. You can walk and see the tourist center, a beautiful Roman historical complex. Thanks to the Mérida city council and its kind people"
400055,2645740,5,nondiknora,07/04/2023,free until December 31 hot shower with a ticket taken from the machine for 15 minutes zero euros very spacious pitches with a garden at the back of the van
400055,2645571,2,robalibis,07/04/2023,"The area is very well fenced. The problem is the management that is being carried out, we arrived in the afternoon and half of the area was empty, but when you entered the APP... it appeared as complete, it did not let you reserve any space. It is what has to be free until 12-31-23....widespread abuse. We were able to sleep in a camp just outside the area. The truth is a pity."
400055,2644510,5,retuheras,06/04/2023,"near the center, with electricity and loading and unloading, free until December 23."
400055,2643850,5,JLCS,06/04/2023,"A good place to spend the night. A family trip in two motorhomes, we arrived at 4.00am and there were still many free places despite how crowded this place was. We recommend it 100%, tranquility and half an hour walking at a slow pace from the center, aqueduct and Roman theater. We will be back!"
400055,2642176,4,VILNARJA,05/04/2023,"A great area, thanks to the Mérida city council for their initiative, the entrance is a bit confusing since at the moment it is free, people put in a three-day stay, which is the maximum and if they leave before the place is occupied and does not allow the passing of more cars. You have to get a ticket to enter, fill/empty, bathrooms... 15min to the center on foot and a spectacular park next to the river 1min away."
400055,2640567,4,ingin69,05/04/2023,"Great facility apart from a few glitches. If arriving at say 1600hrs and registering for 24 hours stay, then leaving at 1100 the following day, the space is booked out until 1600 the day of departure. The booking system is not 'opening' that space after departure and therefore shows as occupied. A bit of work required on the booking system. Free at present until December 2023."
400055,2639326,5,balooui,04/04/2023,We have been about 20 motorhomes outside the enclosure (we have not been able to enter because all the places were blocked). Very quiet night. The park next door amazing. You can see many birds. With the bike or on foot you arrive very quickly to the center of Merida. We will be back!!
400055,2638998,5,MaryBlackberry,04/04/2023,"One of the best areas we have seen so far, thank you Mérida!! Free services, we must appreciate the effort they make to keep it that way. We have slept there, quiet, spacious and clean place."
400055,2638415,5,javilim,04/04/2023,"We have stayed outside the premises, a quiet place 10 minutes from the center, police pass by often, a highly recommended place to see the city, if you want service you have to enter the paid premises."
400055,2637610,4,lyviajera,03/04/2023,"We stayed 2 nights but we couldn't get in, it was full, right next to it there is a large open field where we were more of a caravan than inside because we couldn't get in, it's brand new and close to everything, it has toilets that you can use by getting a ticket from the machine from the entrance, you can also take a shower, drain the water and fill it, and all for free."
400055,2637118,3,sbescos,03/04/2023,"Very modern municipal camper area, but impossible to enter because even if you have made a reservation, people do not leave when appropriate and occupy places. Other squares that look empty belong to people who have already left but the square has not yet been released. In that sense, a disaster. 24 hour telephone service, perfect. Clean bathrooms, and shower without hot water. Filling and emptying is a bit of a mess. The good thing is that just outside there is a very large esplanade, flat, and with a lot of space. The services can be used even if you do not spend the night"
400055,2636283,1,burrika3,02/04/2023,"The site is fantastic, you have an esplanade outside that can accommodate many more, but there is a fairground, where the young people of this country put their cars to the test, skidding and accelerating, we have not been able to sleep a wink, the police have not gone too far in no time and children and animals scared. Very disappointed, yes, the city is fantastic, it does not deserve this type of treatment."
400055,2635058,5,Metrinibowler,02/04/2023,"In our case, we arrived in the evening and it was completely occupied. The next day in the morning there were many free places and we went in to empty the water and charge the batteries. A test-tube service is free and it worked great."
400055,2634460,4,EmilioEsquivel,01/04/2023,"It is about 10 minutes walk to the city. It is a great area with all the services, the system to enter is very easy to use. Thanks to the City Council for thinking of us. What I didn't like is that you can only stay there for 48 hours, I think visiting the city deserves 72 hours. I have had to leave and stay another day outside the area."
400055,2632478,5,ademortier,31/03/2023,full car park. Seems correct. The adjacent free car park does the trick.
400055,2631289,5,Yaez,30/03/2023,"All services free, maximum stay 48 hours, the form to enter is not complicated, you cannot ask for more. next door is a park on the banks of the river, with spectacular views... thank you Mérida!"
400055,2630699,4,OscarHevia,30/03/2023,"Good area with all services including electricity, toilets and showers. Currently the stay is limited to 48 hours. I think that the system of reservations and stays should be reviewed, right now half of the places are free and it shows them as occupied, preventing entry."
400055,2628462,5,sr_ogando,28/03/2023,"Very good area, free at the moment and the registration process is very simple. Ideal for visiting Merida by bike or on foot."
400055,2627785,1,Rocega,28/03/2023,It seems that now they charge €12. At least I haven't found where to make a reservation without paying.
400055,2625719,5,VeniVidiBibi,26/03/2023,"Great location, and Free at moment 

automated book in procedure use vehicle reg plate and email to secure.

each service on top of parking you need to Add in as an extra.
toilets , service point Ehu etc.

easy walk into the city."
400055,2624947,1,vwt46,26/03/2023,"Bad experience since the places will not be released once the deadline has expired and people reserved and then did not appear, leaving others like us without being able to access the online option, I would remove it to force them to be there since the customer service phone is not able to free the places where there is no one leaving several caravans outside"
400055,2624511,1,Nandoxx,26/03/2023,"The fact that it is new and free (for now) does not justify this. Empty places, expired stays, reservations that never arrive and that the organization does not release for other users, caused 8-20 Aurocsravanas to wait outside the area without being able to access. The screen marked all the occupied, expired places and there were free places. Customer service making excuses. Very badly."
400055,2623526,5,Dompalo,25/03/2023,"Area very well located, about fifteen minutes from the city center. The pitches are wide and well marked out. However, access is quite complicated. Thanks to the city of Mérida."
400055,2622943,4,PremAshira,24/03/2023,"just got the last spot, no need for preregistration. use the log in application press on park for the night find a spot then ur passport number and details you will get a paper and the door will open automatically. there are rvs space outside but without the services."
400055,2622509,5,gertlohse,24/03/2023,"Large, beautiful place right on the outskirts. 10 minutes to downtown. Everything is currently free. Access is gained by entering personal data into a terminal. Too complicated for many campers, so that you have to register multiple times and the terminal shows that the place is full. Some campers do not understand the input at all, despite the language selection. This needs to be reworked."
400055,2622272,5,theCarters,24/03/2023,"Very good place! Nice, clean, quiet, only some trains passing near at day, but it was not disturbing. We stayed for two nights, almost three days, we really enjoyed it! Mercadona is so close, only 5 minites by walk, near the parking there is a big beautiful park, the lovely city center is also close by bike. Currently only cold water in the showers and the laundry isnt working. Highly recommend!!"
400055,2621977,4,joseeleonor,24/03/2023,"Fantastic location, all services free, only the entrance system is a little confusing for the first time, however, by phone it is easily solved. Be careful with automatic watering, do not lean too close to the edge."
400055,2621612,4,LivingInLuna,23/03/2023,"A good site, after the total confusion regards actually getting booked into it… when you access the computer if all the grid is red then there is no room, it’s bad as people book until 17:00 but leave at 08:00 that morning, the computer doesn’t know that they have left and won’t be back, so it leaves empty seats with no other places free….. all facilities work, as long as you like a cold shower which suited me fine ?…. It’s a great place to stay, the trains are no bother and the pizza shop opposite is cracking"
400055,2618709,5,Fleurette24,21/03/2023,"Thank you to the municipality of Mérida for this beautiful brand new area... You have a large market on Tuesday mornings, very quiet and spacious... For the moment, given the free admission, you do not have access to the toilets and at the showers, otherwise, location and services are free. The computer terminal is translated into all languages...gracias"
400055,2616569,4,zary79,20/03/2023,"New area, next to the river with a beautiful promenade and parks for children. It is about 20 min walk from the center. It has all the services, bathrooms, showers... and access by key. The only drawback is that you can hear the trains go by at night."
400055,2616380,4,wesio,19/03/2023,"Ideal place to spend the night, large, spacious with a point of light, gray and black water and filled with water, bathroom,... the site is new, inaugurated a few weeks ago, it is free until December 23. To access you must fill out your data in the touch machine at the entrance, and accept the services you need."
400055,2616345,4,locosporlasalsa,19/03/2023,"Very good area and relatively close to the center for a nice walk along the river at night a bit noisy because of the trains, that's why I don't give it 5 stars"
400055,2615650,4,Prorom,19/03/2023,"Attention: Automatic lawn watering from around 6:00 a.m. Do not stand too close to the edge, as spray nozzles also spray upwards (!). I had a restless night. Otherwise a simple place with turf stones, but it is too complicated to organize and will probably not stay that way for long. Great city. €16 for a combination ticket is worth it."
400055,2613891,5,TAMAYOSAMM,18/03/2023,"They tell me that it's okay, I'll leave the coordinates in case they are worth it to someone, it's next to the fairgrounds. 38.9257439,-6.3554265"
400055,2611383,5,EsmeraldaMazzu,16/03/2023,there is a train every half hour of the day until late at night. but not there at night. Fortunately. Very flat and free services at the moment.
400055,2610819,4,zwoiufftour,15/03/2023,"Check-in terminal in different languages. Additional help is available over the phone. Many fail because of the signature that you have to make on the screen on a white field. Tickets for services: water, shower and electricity etc. can also be printed or booked after check-in. All things new. Unfortunately only cold shower. Everything is free at the moment."
400055,2609648,4,yayamparo,14/03/2023,Brilliant. All free at the moment.

400070,2715568,5,samidu,02/05/2023,"The last kilometer of the journey leads over a narrow road - I would not drive here with a liner. With a van you can stand between the bushes, for larger vehicles there is a free area. The place is a nice place in the middle of nowhere - but you have to be really self-sufficient. So far there is no service. Beautiful hiking trail through fragrant herbs up to the Coll de Rates."
400070,2657109,5,Ray68,10/04/2023,"A fantastic place at the foot of the mountain, ideal for hiking. It is very well cared for with trees and plants native to the area, it is very special, quiet and very beautiful. The facilities are not finished yet, there are no services, but with my motorhome we have spent some fantastic days, we will repeat for sure."
400074,3125018,5,AleyBelen,11/08/2023,"Very nice staff, we have refueled and they have kindly let us fill the water tank."

Our dog was super happy with the space and was able to run free in the property. Lots of entertainment for the kids too. Small farm with chickens, sheeps, ducks, bunnies & pigs. Nice pool to refresh. The vegetables are organic and super yummy. We’ll definitely come back"
400140,3170941,5,AdrienGaut,18/08/2023,"Monica showed us around the farm with great sympathy and passion for animals and the land. The place is peaceful and calm, everything is very clean and well laid out, well thought out, there is everything you need.

400140,2917157,5,Ferdinand305,02/07/2023,"Mónica, she answered right away when I called and waited for me even though she had an appointment for dinner. You are standing in a wild meadow mowed by their sheep. There is electricity and a tap for drinking water. In the upper garden there is a shower, toilet, sink, pool and Wi-Fi. There is also a cottage there for rent through Airbnb. You get something from the vegetables."
400140,2895647,5,aitchebo,26/06/2023,"A perfect spot in the middle of the countryside, a green field surrounded by woods and nature. A very welcoming host, a cool swimming pool, and vegetables from the farm"

The hosts were super welcoming, gave us lots of tips and delicious vegetables. Our small children were allowed to feed all the animals in the morning. The pool was another highlight. The bathroom is simple but functional. If you are looking for peace and love animals and nature, you should definitely come here!"

The shame is the beach, which in this area is full of rocks and it is difficult to take a swim if you are not wearing flip-flops. but it is very good"

We cannot 5 stars because we did not locate the toilets and in the morning we heard a lot of dog barking that woke us up (maybe there is a kennel nearby)."
400241,3111973,4,nijoable,10/08/2023,Full during the day but places start to become available in the evening. You can spend the night there. There are showers on the beach. There are also public toilets but they were locked.

400241,2975398,3,sairo,16/07/2023,The noise at night is assured and more weekends. It is mainly a car park. Large motorhomes occupying two seats. The left side can accommodate 6-meter vehicles occupying a single space. The national police drove by several times. Some tourism with chairs outside…
400241,2951631,3,daianabouzo,11/07/2023,"all good, central, next to the beach, but at night there is too much movement of people until 2 am, we went in July!"

400241,2700093,5,jmvarmar,27/04/2023,"Quiet place in a paved parking lot. The bad is the abuse of people who think that this is a campsite, they set up tents, take out clotheslines, set up tables, camping gas,... In short, we all pay the consequences for these abuses"
400241,2684710,3,Aquilino23,21/04/2023,"You have to park between car spaces, the ACs occupy two car spaces, there are several ACs parked Quiet place to spend the night next to the beach, noise at dawn from construction next to the parking lot. Recommended to spend the night"
400241,2683615,5,Hymersnobs,20/04/2023,"car park full of Motorhomes by 14,00 but otherwise an ideal stop. 10minute walk to bars restaurants along promenade or 45min into centre of Almeria. Beach in front is clean and wide. No services other than bins, beach-showers and water taps for filling water bottle on promenade"
400241,2668168,5,AnBaKS98,13/04/2023,Slept here one night and felt safe. There were many other mobile homes here overnight.
400241,2664574,4,Firo,12/04/2023,Right on the beach a large parking area that seems to welcome campers overnight. On outskirts of Almeria but a superb promenade and separate cycle track run in front of the parking. Best parking we could find. Lost a star as no services but water in the children's park next door. Next to Reposol garage.
400241,2652241,4,balluss,09/04/2023,Perfect place we spent two nights and no problem the only drawback is that it has no service and that in the morning there are dogs nearby that start to bark a lot otherwise great recommended
400241,2636545,4,JuanySonia,03/04/2023,"It is wonderful, the pity is that it does not have filling and emptying services. Right on the beach, with a great playground, bike path that takes you all over the city. Nearby gas station where you can wash the motorhome due to its dimensions. We will be back!"
400241,2628545,4,HilSo,28/03/2023,"One of the few places where you can park and spend the night in Almería. Nice view over the sea and sunset. Immediately on the boulevard for walking and cycling or with the seat to the beach. Pressure tap with drinking water at the playground, waste bins and lighting. Place for more than 25 campers. Pretty quiet for being in town."
400241,2611499,4,chantaldante,16/03/2023,We stayed one night. Respect the place don't take anything out and no need to take 4 places to park as we saw last night when 2 places are more than enough.
400244,3031842,5,Milchchef,27/07/2023,Mega awesome place!!
400244,2980375,3,dustcamper,17/07/2023,"I give it 3 stars because it is not completely flat but mainly because it is located in a natural park, so overnight stays are prohibited and you could be penalized. If you sleep you should take it into account."
400244,2680446,5,franck13,19/04/2023,Complies with the description. Nothing to add. Very good for two converted vans.

400266,2883700,1,Freshskimo,23/06/2023,The whole area there says no campers/caravans sadly.
400266,2710167,5,moca13,30/04/2023,Superb place close to Granada. We spent too much night there. There is plenty of room!
400266,2661868,1,joshdavidr,11/04/2023,Sign says no Campervans/Caravans overnight. Dirt road to the site also very narrow.
400266,2625548,3,celiwak,26/03/2023,This nature spot that I propose to you is indeed a nugget but to know that people I met had to leave because the police came to ask them to leave the place. Unfortunately it is not vanlifers who leave litter but locals who end up here. I could see it.
400266,2625361,4,annie.paleni,26/03/2023,"+ beautiful view, surrounded by olive trees, calm
- trash laying around


It is a very nice place with a great views and good starting point for day trips around. Unfortunately, it is not very well taken care of and there is a lot of trash laying around on the ground."
400266,2619234,4,goupillepa,22/03/2023,"For vehicles with a cell of 7 m and more, prefer the path on the right, access is easier but the view is certainly less beautiful. Very good spot. Thanks to the discoverers! And indeed, respect the place... In addition, you can park your car (during the day) at the abbey of Sacromonte and from there walk down to the alhambra in about 30'! A little longer ascent of course..."
400278,2934809,2,Miven111,07/07/2023,Not recommend. Locals told us if we park here to refill water the police will come. It is on playground do parking is difficult
400278,2794699,5,KerryAnn,28/05/2023,Fast flowing & tastes alright
400290,2681846,4,Roel964,19/04/2023,Driving quietly with our camper bus (600x205cm) we arrived at this purely natural place. Unfortunately no view. And of course no internet.
400290,2622578,5,kapitannemo,24/03/2023,Great but uneven. Nice and quiet.
400292,3089426,4,familycamperaventureros,06/08/2023,"We spent the night to do the waterfall the next day, the night was super quiet but it was worth going up the Puff road but the waterfall is worth it"
400293,3293981,5,kwochner,13/09/2023,Nice and simple place in rural Altentejo. Use the M501 road from San Teotonio to avoid the gravel road. Vehicles longer than 6.5m are not welcome as the space is too small.
400293,3271595,5,MIN081,08/09/2023,"We slept here one night in August, a very beautiful place, immersed in nature. The owners are very kind and friendly. 100% recommendable. We loved the voluntary offer policy. Bedankt!"
400293,3263792,5,Tacococker,06/09/2023,"Beautiful place with very neat outdoor shower and dry toilet. Accessible from both sides, but the least bumpy road (a bit of a detour) is recommended. Friendly welcome"
400293,3247529,5,henri_J,01/09/2023,we confirm the quality of the welcome. be careful not to take the dirt road given to us by Waze (GPS). it is so bad that it requires you to drive at 10 km/h for 4 km. the GPS takes us a small road on the right coming from Odeceixe. you should not take it but continue straight ahead to take a tarmac road.
400293,3230809,5,emelyhoffmann,28/08/2023,Beautiful place to stay. The owners are very nice people and the gave us some great recommendations for the area. We would definitely stay here again.

We had access to a clean dry toilet and a cool outdoor shower that was really nice. We were also allowed to use their swimming pool and received great tips for doing things in the area. We really had 2 wonderful nights and highly recommend this venue! Sleeping on a donation basis, something is better than nothing."
400293,3203695,5,EdwinSolen,23/08/2023,"Just behind the rugged coast in the middle of a rolling and varied landscape, this small campsite is located next to the small lovely house of these two friendly campsite owners. Kindly received and provided with the necessary tips. Enjoy the fresh shower and the tranquility in the middle of nature. These are the rare places that make your heart beat faster. I'll definitely come back"

400293,2908514,5,EL58,30/06/2023,"If you’re looking for some quiet time in the countryside with beaches on a short drive this is the place: a small area - 4 spots- designated for (smaller) campers or tents equipped with the basics (restroom, shower etc), as part of a 20HA farm. Henry is around for tips & talks and there is a small swimming pool to refresh yourself. Google made me take the long bumpy road there, pls be aware there is a paved short one as well (just stay on the M501)."
400293,2908144,5,kfunkenflug,30/06/2023,We had a wonderful stay at Henrys place. He's a great host and made us feel very welcome. It's a quiet spot in nature with lots of eucalyptus and kork trees around. We can highly recommend this place! <3
400293,2883031,5,TonyIberler,23/06/2023,"A wonderful and quiet place in the middle of nowhere.

The facilities were tidy, though only cold water was available."
400293,2872123,5,johnfran,19/06/2023,Really nice place!! We enjoyed the place with the view of the cows next to our camper. The owner had good tips for the surroundings but also gives you all the privacy. Nice shower and toilet! What more do you need

400293,2747473,5,TimFaaij,13/05/2023,"A beautiful, quiet place in the middle of nature. The owners made us feel very comfortable with their stories about the farm. We could choose our own spot on the field. No luxury, but the environment, the tranquility and the hospitality are more than worth this place. Ask the owners for tips and they can tell you all about the area and beyond. Thanks again!"

400350,3191825,4,burie17770,21/08/2023,good clean area and with functional services. I put 4 stars and not 5 because of the registration which is tedious and where you are asked for a lot of information which I find excessive. Inexpensive considering the price quality and the number of services included in the price.

It is quiet and the sanitary facilities are very tidy and modern. The place is ideal for anyone with children as there is a lot for the little ones to discover.

400382,2952087,5,jrodgal020,11/07/2023,"My wife and our two children traveled in our California and it has been a real pleasure to stay in this wonderful Camper Park. Katrin, Marina and Eduardo are great, some 10 hosts. The perfect facilities, both for the vans and motorhomes and for the Little ones have fun. The yurts are amazing. The clean services and everything prepared for emptying sewage. Thank you!"
400382,2937827,5,ModestoIria,08/07/2023,"Incredible place, everything very clean and with all the services needed for a great stay, the owners are very nice and help with everything, they care to make you comfortable, they have a small pool for the little ones to cool off, areas to paint and play, the little ones don't get bored, it's wonderful, we'll do it again!!!"
400382,2924453,5,RobertBorchel,04/07/2023,"Very good owner-managed campsite, perfect for small and slightly older children. You can move very freely and feel at home! There is plenty of space and toys including a small pool, mud kitchen, library and children's vehicle park for shared use. Much too good only for the transit and we therefore made four out of two nights before we continued."
400382,2906396,5,DaniT,30/06/2023,"The entrance to the compound is a bit unusual if you are a novice. Better to phone the owners if there are any questions. Unbeatable treatment. If you come with children, the site is better than most camperparks. Everything very clean and new, in a very relaxing environment. A different experience. Even I have had a great time in the atelier. We will be back. They have a dwarf rooster that sings very funny."
400382,2890791,5,bogar,25/06/2023,An incredible place to spend a few days relaxing with your little ones. Everything is very new. With spaces designed for children. We have been passing through one night and the treatment has been unbeatable. It looks more like a campground than an area. We will repeat for sure. Bravo for the initiative
400382,2845442,5,Liayamelie,12/06/2023,"Quiet environment, you feel that you are in the middle of nature and the little ones at home stay entertained all day and play with a multitude of options. They have a swimming pool. The facilities are very clean and new, we leave with the feeling that we have experienced something magical and special. There are very close areas in the same town to buy: Super, bars, pizeria, playgrounds. We fill water."
400382,2842821,5,Unraus,11/06/2023,"We were as a family in the second week of Pentecost and spent our vacation on site. We stayed in one of the beautiful yurts. The place and the yurt have completely met our expectations, we would say even exceeded them. The yurt is really nicely furnished and offers a perfect place to relax after a great day out in the beautiful surroundings."
400382,2818660,5,FamMertens23,04/06/2023,"Warm welcome! a very nice place to stay, good facilities! For children it is a great place !! Nice explanation from the owners!"
400382,2816478,5,Fam.SchmiFa,03/06/2023,"Our expectations from previous reviews were more than met. Particularly noteworthy is the weather independence on this course. At the moment there is still a lot of construction going on, a lot of work being done and it is evolving every day. Children from 2 years pay as an additional person. (Baby bathtub planned for (currently under construction) sanitary building and will therefore soon be available.)"
400382,2810464,5,iamdtl,01/06/2023,We had a lovely stay here and thank you so much to Katrin who couldn’t have been more helpful. One of us needed to see the medic so we ended up staying more nights than planned and she helped us find a local hospital. It was a super friendly atmosphere and very relaxing perfect for children and everyone!!
400382,2802335,5,SandraFrey,30/05/2023,"Then Camp y Niño is THE place in the Almeria area. Shops, restaurants, bakeries,... everything wonderfully untouristy and mostly quiet, only the sports hall next door makes for a bit of background noise at weekends. Free-range chickens are great, but don't worry about the occasional chicken and peacock landmine. We'd love to come back!"
400382,2780287,5,Krissi1305,23/05/2023,"We stayed here for one night in transit. It really is a paradise for children. The playhouse with books, Montessori toys and much more. is great! Unfortunately, it gets pretty hot in the playhouse & yurt during the day. You stand nicely between the trees and the bathroom huts have been beautifully prepared. At night dogs could be heard barking in the neighborhood - but that didn't bother us."
400382,2774375,5,BianciFranky,22/05/2023,"We were warmly welcomed. It's a paradise for children. The possibilities to play inside and outside are great. We actually only wanted to spend one night here as a stopover, but ended up staying 5 nights. We have felt very comfortable here. We would also give 10 stars."
400382,2763728,5,ro220863,19/05/2023,"Super nice reception from both. We drove in with a 3.70 high, 2.50 wide and 10.50 meter long expedition vehicle. Shopping bar and bank very central. Very familiar place, you can really feel at home here, even if you don't have children. Everything very well maintained. Muy bien. Many thanks to the operators"
400382,2755858,5,andipe,17/05/2023,"Super warm welcome, Katrin showed us everything right away. Beautiful site, great concept. Chickens, cats and peacocks roam free. A paradise for children, but also for adults."
400382,2741140,5,thilotravels,11/05/2023,"5/5 if traveling with children. A studio for painting and handicrafts, a wooden house with a play kitchen, books, wooden toys and a bungalow with lots of cars and movement toys, playground with mud kitchen, trampoline and pool... a children's paradise. Let us tell you the story of the place! Owners are very friendly. For us it was great. To be fair, it wouldn't be our first choice without children."
400382,2716070,5,Tifany2805,02/05/2023,"We loved the concept for families and children. We came for one night then finally two, we always want to stay longer because the welcome of the owners is great! And especially the children do not want to leave. The services provided are very clean. Thanks to Katrin and her husband!"
400382,2712673,5,nflorance,01/05/2023,"We didn’t want to leave! Meant to stay 1 night, ended up with 2 but our daughter begged us for longer. Really peaceful set up with the best showers/bathrooms we have found in over 2 months of travelling. So much for the kids (of all ages) to do. Ed and Katrin were superb hosts a we couldn’t have asked for more. Do yourself a favour and make sure you make a stop here especially if you have kids!"
400382,2711786,5,Kristin11,01/05/2023,We were warmly welcomed and had a great time. One night turned into two and it was paradise for our children. Thanks to Katrin and Eddie and all the best for this great project.
400382,2709243,5,mili19,30/04/2023,"Thank you very much Katrin and Eddie for these three days. Perfect reception, children have everything to play, the farm also has all the services, they have chickens, peacocks, showers and toilets in perfect condition and clean. We are highly recommended for families with children. We will be back!!"
400382,2699287,4,Dorothea650,26/04/2023,"We stayed here for 2 nights and were warmly welcomed by Katrin and Eddie. The place has a great concept for families with children. We wish them both every success with the pitch, because we felt very comfortable."
400382,2698192,5,KaddiGerdes,26/04/2023,"Kathrin and Eddi welcomed us warmly, took a lot of time to show everything and were always available for questions. Our son had fun playing with the two children and using the numerous play opportunities, whether outside or inside. We were able to do our laundry and walk to a small shop in 4 minutes. That was great!!"
400382,2697140,5,gawat,25/04/2023,"A very nice experience in this paradise for children. Nevertheless, noisy as to the location and sometimes unpleasant scents on our site."
400382,2696638,5,Marionlga,25/04/2023,"A little paradise for young and old. Located about ten minutes from Tabernas. The reception is perfect, everything is clean and well maintained. We came for 1 night we stayed 3 nights and I will have stayed well again. A bit difficult to find as there is nothing to indicate but I think this will change as they have just opened."
400382,2695894,4,ABdeW,25/04/2023,"A green paradise in its surrounding. This place is just perfect with child/ren. If Katrien & Eddie realise the pool as they plan to, there is just no reason to leave the camping. We stayed for 3 days and loved it. In the direct surrounding there are not many bike or walking possibilities, so therefore 4 stars. We like to get active without having to use a car or van. The camping is defenitely 5!"
400382,2692670,5,Immacreus,24/04/2023,"A very quiet place, ideal to go with children. Everything very clean and familiar treatment with the owners. Thank you so much Katrin and family!!!"
400382,2685330,5,Elli3010,21/04/2023,"Katrin & Eddie create a beautiful spot here. We stayed there for 3 nights and can really only recommend it. ❤️ The offer for the children is huge, many great toys according to Montessori. We really enjoyed our time there."
400382,2677785,5,BarreBarend,17/04/2023,"As far as we are concerned, one of the most beautiful campsites in Spain. With grass (!), good facilities & the managers super cordial. There is a 'gemütlich' atmosphere, because of the chickens, peacocks & children who walk together. Even if you don't have children, it's a good place to be. Almost literally an oasis in the desert. We & our cat really enjoyed it! NB work is still being done on the gray water drainage."
400382,2676779,5,PatrickEngl,17/04/2023,There is nothing better for families with kids! A paradise and you immediately feel at home!
400382,2675542,5,bildergitte,16/04/2023,"A wonderful family pitch or camping. We felt very comfortable - like staying with friends. Super friendly and helpful hosts. Sanitary spotlessly clean, the grounds green. Everything lovingly designed, even if some things are still under construction - that will be great too. Lots of opportunities for children up to 12. You don't miss the beach here at all."
400382,2671578,4,amaiuriraia,15/04/2023,The site is beautiful!! but the price indicated is not correct. €35 for 1 night seems excessive to me.
400382,2670725,4,SusiBen,14/04/2023,"A special area, unique for children, where they can find a multitude of activities and learning, safe and free. We loved it and stayed two nights instead of one. There is a very pleasant family atmosphere. Highly recommended for a stop to relax and rest. Services continue to improve and expand, although a gray water discharge area is still missing. The owners are attentive and friendly."
400382,2662871,5,Androph,11/04/2023,"A green oasis in the middle of the arid landscape. A paradise for children and a family place to really feel good. The hosts are warm and accommodating. All daily needs are within walking distance (supermarket, tobacconist, bank, ...). We also spontaneously extended our stay and would love to come back. It was really nice with you!"
400382,2661710,5,FabianHerbrand,11/04/2023,"Through a very warm, open, young German emigrant couple with 2 great boys, a small, green children's paradise was created, chickens and peacocks have free range. Sanitary facilities are top and there is a communal kitchen with a veranda. In the expansion phase, which has not yet been completed, there will be approx. 10 SP for Womos. We wanted to stay 1 night, there were 4. We'd love to come back!"
400382,2659255,5,drLeuz,10/04/2023,"we stayed for four nights...and would come again: very friendly and helpful, clean and well-kept, etc. great! hikes and paragliding are perfectly possible in the immediate vicinity."
400382,2654931,5,Travelbeck,09/04/2023,Unfortunately we only stayed one night. The two hosts have really created a paradise for families here. We hardly saw our children :) We'd love to come back. Thanks very much!
400382,2654118,5,hannahskm,09/04/2023,We stayed for one night and were welcomed very friendly. A beautiful place that we can highly recommend!
400382,2653353,5,Kvanto,09/04/2023,"Amazing campsite, perfect for kids. We came for one night but decided to stay for 3 nights. There is a lot of greenery, trees, natural shade and freshness here. You will not find anything like this in neighboring campsites. There is a large open kitchen, two showers, toilets, playrooms, a chicken coop and a BBQ area. Highly recommend!"
400382,2645179,5,MarianneFretz,06/04/2023,"We were on 4/1/23 in this wonderful place. We really liked it with Katrin, Eddie and their two children Theodor and Leopold, who are living their dream. Everything you need in a family environment."
400382,2642039,5,Beloga,05/04/2023,"A great area. A little paradise. Tranquility for adults and fun for children. There are many possibilities for games, animals... All very clean. The owners are very attentive and friendly. We will be back."
400382,2641414,5,sibays,05/04/2023,"We had a wonderful time. The welcome is perfect, the infrastructure is wow… It's a paradise for young and old! We have to stay 5 minutes and we finally spent the night. A halt is necessary. Big plus, Katrin speaks French, German, English correctly and her husband Eddy is available to help you."
400382,2632849,5,paul1989,01/04/2023,A dream for families with children! The hosts Eddie and Katrin are passionate campers themselves and put a lot of effort into building this beautiful place. We will be back! No's Vemos :)
400382,2632589,5,FamiliaCortesTorras,31/03/2023,"A highly recommended 10 place, the hosts are super attentive to everything, it is a place that is great for children since it looks like a large daycare center. Surely if we go back there we will pass. In short, very well, no, the following."
400382,2630829,5,ResiundOli,30/03/2023,Grandiose is not a word at all. A little paradise for children. You won't even find such a large and great offer in all day-care centers. The hosts Eddie and Katrin are so welcoming. We only wanted to stay one night and left with a heavy heart after two nights as we had booked a ferry. We would have loved to have stayed a few days longer. Cleanliness is great.
400382,2622836,5,Feuerrotespielmobil,24/03/2023,"We felt extremely comfortable on the great spot between the orange trees, the chickens and peacocks with the nice German couple and their two children, who are building a paradise for camping families here. The sanitary facilities are outstanding! The 12 km to Almeria or to the sea can be easily covered by bike. Next door is a good cheap bar and supermarket."
400399,3244099,3,Little-Uke,01/09/2023,"OK for one night, flat ground, dusty when it's dry."
400399,2666316,1,karma64,13/04/2023,"Illuminated car park at night from 10 or 11 p.m., practical for one night if the campsites are full, it's just troubleshooting. On weekends, many locals pass by during the day."
400399,2658126,1,jakana,10/04/2023,"It is a dangerous place. An entire German motorhome was stolen yesterday, the vehicle was taken away. The entire area is unsafe but very beautiful to take extreme security measures."
400399,2630740,1,W.Bedrich,30/03/2023,Is just a parking lot with no possibility of disposal
400404,3267156,3,MissL,07/09/2023,"Perfect for parking and taking a walk through the town or taking the beautiful Los Cahorros route. I wouldn't sleep, mind you. For that I went to the nearby Camper Park. For the rest, at the entrance to the town it clearly says that caravans or motorhomes are not allowed to park but we have a camper van and we take a risk. Then we saw that there were very large caravans in this parking lot..."
400404,2908333,5,enbuscadelsol,30/06/2023,"A good place to spend the night, some dust and a lot of mosquitoes but the tranquility and the sound of the river next to it make up for it! I recommend you go on the hiking trail, spectacular!!"
400404,2807281,5,MikeDo,31/05/2023,"The journey is a bit exciting, but as some have already written, it is quite feasible. I got there with 8m and used the second entrance. From here you can start a really nice hike through the gorge. I liked it very much!"
400404,2804561,3,Woodhiker,31/05/2023,"A parking lot in the middle of the town. formally, motorhome overnight stays are prohibited throughout the city. When you walk a bit downstream of the river you will find a small supermarket and a terrace next to the tourist shop. Good base for the hiking trails."
400404,2802772,5,Guyonaarts,30/05/2023,"Super place. We only slept here 1 night but would have liked to stay here longer. road to it feels narrow but is fine, even with a large camper (ours is over 8m). Walking route is definitely worth it and easy to do (also with children). pity that people give 1 star when they have not slept here."
400404,2785305,5,DavidPresa,25/05/2023,"Very spacious, several trees to catch shade and a very quiet place. We did the Cahorros route from there and it was great!"
400404,2763327,3,Dariods92,19/05/2023,"Nice place, not very clean, but quiet at night and the los cahorros trail is worth doing. Slept well and nearby also bars."
400404,2709662,4,afryvega,30/04/2023,"The place is super good, very close to the beginning of the route the puppies that I highly recommend. But if you come on a weekend, keep in mind that the parking lot is full, conclusion, I was locked up for a whole day, until it cleared up and I got out."
400404,2698480,3,Quinou,26/04/2023,Great for the night to do the Los Cahorros loop the next day. No service but trash cans
400404,2663194,1,Sagu,11/04/2023,At the entrance to the village there is a large sign that prohibits parking motorhomes. We passed by the town.
400404,2657397,5,martmsnz,10/04/2023,"We stayed 2 nights and we were very quiet, with the sound of the river in the background. Without services, but perfect to start the route of the Cahorros or move to Granada city."
400404,2618244,3,robintom88,21/03/2023,We tries to go there but navigation sended us really small street to go there. We didnt do it…
400410,2685474,5,mjvemg,21/04/2023,Fabulous park up. On the edge of the lovely village of Mora. Previous comments mention the lane into the picnic area but it’s fine. Shops 20 mins walk away. No services. Very quiet right next to the river. A few friendly fishermen. Lots of space. Stayed one night. No problems.
400419,2634020,1,nosconocimosviajando,01/04/2023,We have already stopped part of being closed there was nothing to fill the waters or empty

400435,2823331,4,ptcarlospt,05/06/2023,"On 06/05/2023, the electricity points are there, brand new, but turned off. But it is sad to see such a poorly planned new area, making mistakes in simple things, such as the absence of a place to discharge black water (there is only one hole in the floor written WC) and only one water point for recharging, which they will inevitably use to wash the cassette."
400435,2787250,4,Rhithik,26/05/2023,"Beautiful camper place in the making. Electricity is not yet connected. At the time we were there, the municipality was doing maintenance. Fine! Open the barrier yourself. Emptying the toilet is now an iron lid in the ground. Trees are still small and offer no shade yet. Continued great, thanks!"
400435,2725639,5,ArnoRuijgt,05/05/2023,"If you want to enter, you have to lift the barrier. All amenities are available. Electricity from next week. There is hardly any shade."
400435,2688135,5,Frankly_,22/04/2023,"Wonderfully quiet place, although I was here at the weekend so the nearby road was practically deserted. From here you can walk through the woods just outside the village, I even saw a fox! The trash can on the spot itself is indeed very small, but just outside the fence is a blue barrel which is also a trash can (see last photo)."
400435,2679219,4,Elsonc,18/04/2023,"Great free service. The barrier is down but  not locked the local groundsman just told us to open it for entry and exit. Grey/black waste working fine. water supply good.  the garbage bin is tiny. Electric is not turned on.  Surrounded by a pretty stream to, open field, waste ground and then a busy road, which during the day has lots of wagons. After dark quiet, road noise starts around 6:30am"
400435,2674046,5,dragonqueen,16/04/2023,"Supply and disposal perfect, electricity not connected. We spent a quiet night with a second motorhome. Thanks to the community for this good offer."

400445,2740262,3,PATDesmo,10/05/2023,"slightly set back from the cabin near the water point. I leave a mixed opinion because officially it is forbidden to sleep in the park (I didn't have the info). Wake up by the guard in the early morning, negotiation for the fine and immediate departure!! To know !!"
400445,2708336,4,OihanePaPer,30/04/2023,"an open, quiet place without traffic or people, away from all the hubbub of Bardenas. We saw a beautiful sunset and sunrise. There are two shelters next door, but one appears abandoned and the other is for use by reserve staff. The only bad thing is that it is very exposed if there is a lot of wind or sun (there is no shade). Highly recommended."

Electricity, bathroom, shower, 5 months to eat outside in the garden, a gym (€5) that has a climbing wall, stationary bikes, rowing machine, relaxation area,...with Wi-Fi and a tablet to play the music you want. Carlos very attentive, nice, mountaineer / climber. It gives a lot of information about routes, what to visit. We went with a dog and we have had it loose throughout the compound! Night €5"
400447,3215129,5,royju,25/08/2023,"For a person like Carles to open the doors of his house and make you feel as if it were yours, is something very magical. Space of peace and tranquility. Parking in the garden, light point and light. Also outdoor shower, shaded area for cooking and eating, bathroom with hot water, and climbing wall, gym. The two dogs are pure love. Thank you for everything, we will repeat (and recommend)."
400447,3154143,5,Antonia_Sureda,15/08/2023,"The place is great to go with the family and also with dogs, it is closed, very cozy. The climbing wall and small gym are ideal for hanging out before dinner. In addition, you have a bathroom and shower! Its owner, Carles, is charming, very hospitable and also advised us on very interesting places to visit in the area. We will repeat for sure!! Thank you Carlos!! Antonia, Toni, Bernat and Martina"
400447,3101069,5,lutin01,08/08/2023,- The parknight4 in Montgai is a very pleasant little find. Four nights in peace as well as the days. Carlos received us with great kindness. Very friendly without being intrusive. I highly recommend.
400447,3073845,5,Joxeandg,04/08/2023,"Exceptional place to disconnect from the daily routine. The owner is very friendly, his hospitality unbeatable. You feel like you are at home. New facilities and in perfect condition (toilets, shower...) and with a climbing wall to train. Also, for mountain bike lovers, the owner takes you to the point where you want to start your route. without a doubt 100% recommended. Thank you!!"

400447,2887476,5,jafaga,24/06/2023,"What was going to be a couple of days turned into several weeks thanks to Carles' hospitality. Access can be difficult for large vehicles. Carles is a charm, he has details in the day to day that make you feel at home. There is a bathroom and shower and there is even a small climbing wall and a gym. Nearby you have several towns of interest such as Penelles, Camarasa or Montsonís."
400447,2837272,5,Luisalves,09/06/2023,"Space with a special energy like the one that Carles and his two furry ones give off, we came with 3 large dogs and it has made us feel very comfortable and with all the facilities, places to go with the dogs and be able to enjoy with them. It is worth the exhibition that it offers as an activity! Awesome! Rocky, remedies and otto will visit you again!!! We wish you the best!"

Carlos is the most hospitable person I have ever met. For little money he has opened the doors of the Himalayas for us, from minute 1. Thanks for everything! see you soon!"
400447,2746095,5,RodantPelMon,13/05/2023,"Carles is just getting started, even so he has opened his doors to us and welcomed us, at the moment it is an ideal place for campers and vans and small motorhomes, we have a 7m one and although we have entered there have been difficulties maneuver, we'll be back, his energy is huge, he deserves to get it. Thank you Carlos."
400447,2732704,5,SusannaCuadros,08/05/2023,It's amazing how you can receive so much service and attention for giving so little. Himalaya is the realization that everything is possible and that there are people like Carlos who are worth crossing paths with. Everything has just started and I think it will soon be a place of worship and pilgrimage. You won't find anything like it anywhere. We'll be back to see how many bee hives customers have painted on the mural.
400447,2702712,5,rollingwithrolo,28/04/2023,"Lovely place to park up! Very peaceful in a small town, nice shower and toilet, lovely terrace that can used and Carles and his two dogs were very friendly and welcoming!"
400447,2654951,5,kildokfm,09/04/2023,"Idyllic space, lots of peace and tranquility! Good accessibility! El Carles, the very friendly host, willing to help, with very good energy! It has an exhibition of Nepal, very special! You can also request the activities available in the space, that is, a climbing wall, paintings, a place to practice yoga and meditation! Without a doubt, we will repeat, a ten experience!"
400447,2641252,5,OriolGarciaMolsosa,05/04/2023,A very good place to spend the night. Very friendly and very attentive. Highly recommended!
400447,2634219,5,LlucGarcia,01/04/2023,"The truth is that it is a great experience, Carles welcomed us with open arms and showed us his spectacular facilities, there is a beautiful climbing wall and the facilities to put the van very spacious and welcoming in the time, a different place to sleep that guarantees you a beautiful experience, thank you Carles for your cordiality, for coming back!"
400447,2622622,5,jreal,24/03/2023,"Very quiet place to rest and spend the night, with clean toilets, tables and a climbing wall. Very close to the bakery. The guy, very friendly, explained routes and activities to do in the area"
400461,2910603,3,noemissima,01/07/2023,Easy access but dirty surroundings (garbage remains) and a lot of noise from passing cars from the highway at night. Spot rescued and safe if you do not have another nearby place but not to repeat.
400470,2621399,4,Chabourne,23/03/2023,The arena car park is unfortunately not very flat and we preferred to go down to the earth car parks below. Otherwise the site is very beautiful.
400504,2897354,5,otto84,27/06/2023,Very quiet place I had no problem
400504,2641424,5,melany00,05/04/2023,"Wonderful place, you get kicked out if you camp but not if you behave decently, like everywhere else on the island. Services present within the structure."
400504,2638902,1,MarcoGambelli,04/04/2023,"It is not possible to camp or sleep in this parking lot. After two hours, surveillance reached us and asked us to leave. There is no service."
400504,2613686,5,andreacarlos91,18/03/2023,Excellent point to park to reach arrecife or playa honda and above all no car or moped that wakes you up during the night
400509,2851844,2,AlexMAB,13/06/2023,"After arriving by boat at dawn it was the first parking lot we went to, in the morning a lot of traffic and there is almost no shade, gravel terrain."
400509,2633779,1,Shibainu,01/04/2023,"Very dusty and noisy, we drove 1 min east on the paved P."
400510,3223888,5,toha01,27/08/2023,Perfect place to stay. Nicely laid out and clean. Nice place. Worth driving off the highway a few kilometers to spend a night.
400510,3204137,4,MarcosGranda,23/08/2023,Good place to sleep after doing the ferrata. thanks to the ayto for this area!!!! when the trees grow it will be the bomb!!!!!
400510,3048955,4,VanRises,31/07/2023,"A basic area, but hopefully more towns will encourage us to make things easier for us. there is no shade but that's how the batteries are charged before it's not all negative haha. next door is a small shady park"
400510,2935879,4,Maldivas,08/07/2023,"Very good area, filling and emptying, nice area, no shade yet, the only downside is the smell and the flies."
400510,2906722,5,Mariabmonereo,30/06/2023,"Very comfortable place. They have to empty gray water, deny and fill clean water. Very bright. Located in one of the entrance areas of the town but hardly without traffic at night. Recommended for a stop along the way. The town has a supermarket, hardware store, bars..."
400510,2755827,2,pasandvan,17/05/2023,A gravel parking area at the entrance to the town. Currently without shade (it will take a few years for the newly planted trees around the area to provide shade). Very noisy at dawn.
400510,2753360,5,JoakingLillo,16/05/2023,clean and newly built. Ideal for passing through or short stays and getting to know the town.
400510,2740886,4,RandallDj,11/05/2023,Clean and very quiet. Clean emptying and filling service
400510,2714622,5,DidierBoutte,01/05/2023,Congratulations on the facilities. Thank you Caudet!
400510,2710110,4,turreexile,30/04/2023,Fully functional aire. Not sure I would fancy it with 8 metres plus van. Quiet place but it is Sunday. Plenty of dog walking close too.
400510,2693481,5,japster,24/04/2023,"Quiet place, clean, everything is perfect, a big thank you to the municipality, I highly recommend, we did our shopping in mercadounia (be careful the cc do not fit in the parking lot) but enough places around."
400510,2690774,4,Aquilino23,23/04/2023,"We stopped to eat, a new area, a quiet place, with all the services. Plaza de toros next door, very nice, bars nearby to have a drink."
400510,2667431,5,PatrickCarretey,13/04/2023,"Great dump area. Thank you to the municipality for the welcome. Drinking water, black water clear water. It's super quiet and you can sleep without problems. I recommend to everyone. So we made a longer stop than planned to visit the surroundings."
400510,2656582,4,elsoplagaitas,10/04/2023,Very quiet place to spend the night. With basic services.
400510,2649528,5,Elioodora,08/04/2023,"Cool space! It has a small park as soon as you cross it, ideal for the little ones. The center is a 10-minute walk away, where there is a larger park (Paseo Golf) with a candy store (Candy)! For dinner we went to La Notaria, a spectacular interior and very tasty food! Thanks to the City Council for the initiative!"
400510,2641226,5,Aquitainerod,05/04/2023,"Great , quiet parking and only 10 mins walk to the centre . New big Mercadona and you can park outside if you don’t fancy walking . Great market on Friday mornings . Plenty of bars in town and places to eat ."
400510,2636707,5,MirellaLorenzo,03/04/2023,"new area, still very clean, they have planted trees around the perimeter, which when they are big will give a good shade, we slept very peacefully, there is a bar nearby, but unfortunately they did not have breakfast. Thank you very much to the town hall."
400510,2633464,5,Wandy007,01/04/2023,Thanks to the municipality for having installed this service area
400510,2629866,5,anitaludo,29/03/2023,A quiet new place with a beautiful village with many attractions.
400510,2625674,5,Razamataz,26/03/2023,"Nice looking Aire,this weekend must be official opening!!!!…totally rammed!!and all around the streets….which were all closed off by police for opening.All very well with a Spanish motorhome rally to celebrate the opening.Very nice town!"
400510,2624197,4,metro1150,25/03/2023,"Excellent motorhome area, with all services except electricity, very quiet, illuminated area very close to the bullring and 10 minutes walk from the urban center"
400510,2623406,5,PedroCaudete,25/03/2023,"If there is a problem with the emptying, you can call the local police and they send the Bar maintenance staff a few meters away."
400510,2623404,5,guenter52,25/03/2023,"Today is March 25th. and the initiation takes place. V/E available. Giant ships can use V/E without any problems, parking could be difficult from a length of 7-8m. Thanks to the province/city. Mercadonia nearby."
400510,2617093,5,sebaihor,20/03/2023,"The area is not yet inaugurated. Let's be a little patient, on March 27 it is scheduled to be operational."
400510,2615690,2,TxorigorriVan,19/03/2023,"The place is nice and quiet, with capacity for about 10 campers. The pity is that the water drain does not work, and there is no contact number for maintenance, so if you are going to stop for this purpose, it is better not to stop here. a pity...."
400511,3210639,5,chrispn33620,24/08/2023,"Perfect for refilling with water, be careful when parking you will have to be a little further down in the very edge of a field of olive trees. Just remember not to throw your papers on the ground, it's nice of the town hall to offer water. We don't spend the night there."
400530,2669749,5,lazloviktor,14/04/2023,"Picnic area above the car park with 3 tables, one in the shade. 100m away is a very nice and shady recreational area with lots of water. Ideal with children on hot days. Very narrow place in Istán center on the driveway. With 1x reset we just got through with our 6m-Womo."
400540,2755183,5,FabiFred,16/05/2023,Super friendly staff. Water with good pressure.
400540,2731395,5,Elis22,07/05/2023,Free water tap. Great.
400543,2751456,4,anaistak,15/05/2023,it's a great spot! but for campsites because it is quite difficult to access especially with the branches and there is a small hill which can cause the chassis to rub. the ground is not level. I think this place is better for vans or small motorhomes (ours is 5m70 and it was ok but fair) it is better to stand on the path at the entrance where there are benches
400551,3111088,1,jutul85,09/08/2023,There is nothing here !! Fools. We have gone to spend the night but we have left because there is nothing.
400557,2951494,4,catasiras,11/07/2023,"Convenient location very close to the sea, shaded"
400581,3195594,3,CRT04,21/08/2023,It's fine but it still doesn't have water or electricity.
400581,2895887,1,RufioF1,26/06/2023,"The site is very good, next to a park but as of today, June 26, the electricity and water services were not yet available"
400581,2743554,3,IKERMAN,12/05/2023,"Almost new place to park, straight ahead and around a bird watching center to visit. I am not giving it 5 stars because 2 workers from the town hall have arrived at 8 in the morning to clear leaves and with the music from the car at full blast without respecting that we are possibly sleeping inside the motorhomes."
400581,2702330,1,kpcar,28/04/2023,"parking to spend the night, neither electricity nor water is operational, the bathroom is useless, destroyed and very dirty, a pity because the area is new and they have left it disgusting."
400581,2696732,3,jaimegpuente,25/04/2023,"Practical for an early visit to Arrocampo but right now it is still a car park next to a road with a lot of traffic. In any case, good for the council for this future motorhome area."
400581,2635489,5,PlanetA,02/04/2023,"Very quiet place with fantastic birdlife. Supply and disposal not yet in operation, but not a problem if you can stand independently for a few days."
400581,2616003,2,Caravanadominguera,19/03/2023,"Very calm. Near the bird observatory. Only gray can be emptied, electricity and water is paid but it is disabled. The bathrooms are open. There is a great bar a few meters away with a children's area. There are no shadows and park any other bus next to it."
400592,3176843,2,JoanaVasques,18/08/2023,"Did not actually stay because fits only one camper and smelled weird in the air. the view is only nice in one direction, in the other you see the damn and at the bottom on the road it's quite filthy. The spot did not give the best vibes..."
400592,3150352,5,Nico21320,15/08/2023,"Even better: drive down the road to the lake, and spend the night by the water. Some waste related to the variation of the height of water, but the place is top."
400592,3143852,5,lukasdls,14/08/2023,"Great place, quiet with a view of the dam. No passage all night, I recommend"
400593,3283599,4,frankherrmann61,11/09/2023,"Great place for a night. Water, tables and a barbecue area (unfortunately it was closed) were available. Totally quiet, slept great. Would come again."
400593,3007924,4,Asiercc,23/07/2023,"Nice place, with a picnic area, swings for the children, a fountain and garbage containers. We slept very peacefully, another van and us. As negative points, there were no completely flat areas and it was infested with mosquitoes (we didn't even have breakfast there because of that). This problem probably won't occur at any other time of the year."
400602,2929714,1,guillaume32,06/07/2023,"I just called the campground and it's two night minimum. it costs €100 for 1 pitch and two adults, so €50 per night. all my campsites are in its tariffs. I wonder whether to come to Spain."
400686,2757442,5,gonza83,17/05/2023,Land to park and spend the night with views of the valley. Recommendable. Next to the road but no noise at night as it is not very busy
400688,2671326,3,JoseEnrique55,15/04/2023,Here we were and an environmental agent identifies us to propose a sanction. Easter Sunday 04/09/2023
400688,2644081,5,marcesther,06/04/2023,"Very good spot. It can be easily reached with a normal camper along the dirt track, a 4x4 is not necessary, I would even say a large-volume camper, but impossible for AC due to the narrowness of the streets that give access to the forest track. Beautiful place next to a raft, quite flat and from which several excursions depart. Very sunny value it in summer."
400692,3269612,5,ChrysR,07/09/2023,very clean. suitable for a CC of 7m. very convenient
400692,2740299,3,dupi24,10/05/2023,Not long enough for a large motorhome but fortunately there is space along
400692,2703415,4,PeTi1111,28/04/2023,"We arrived at 10am Friday morning and were lucky the spot was still available! The place is centrally located, 4 minutes by bike to centro! There is a big market here on Saturdays"
400699,2619160,1,Shibainu,22/03/2023,"Very loud, coming and going. At night at 00.30 a.m., the refuse collection truck runs right next to us for 30 minutes..."
400701,3242034,1,YasVan,31/08/2023,Danger! Only possible by car. We ended up in streets that were far too narrow with our 6m long campervan and could hardly get out again. It was super stressful. Better to stand at a distance and walk or take the bus.
400712,2799722,4,MaretJ,29/05/2023,"Exit from the highway, sign lookout point, end of the old road, dead end. Nice view. Slightly inclined, but possible to spend the night."
400721,2677634,2,HiNo,17/04/2023,Here you stand behind a row of houses without a sea view. Blue lines (so actually subject to a fee). The entrances to the small beaches are blocked off with ugly wire fences (due to bad storms there is still an acute danger of collapse). There is construction noise from houses that are being restored. It's a shame that there is no official parking space in Guardamar: the place with its parks would have deserved it.
400732,3150854,3,seramo,15/08/2023,The height is 2.20m and the price they put in their pricing must be added to the VAT. €2.11/h. The bathrooms very clean. 15 minute walk to Calle Larios.
400756,3031241,5,1111marta,27/07/2023,Thanks to the people of Paredes de Nava for this area. It is essential to visit the nuns to buy their sweets and also a visit to Sta Eulalia to see paintings by Pedro and Alonso Berruguete.
400756,2955169,5,camperfree1956,12/07/2023,"Thanks to all the people who have made this good area possible in a beautiful town that is very close to the canal. A few trees for the future would already be a luxury. Encourage the caravanists to consume products from the municipality, thank you very much"
400756,2653856,5,patodgoma,09/04/2023,"Thanks to the City Council for this area, with all the services right next to the Health Center. They have informed us that it will soon be paved, which is essential if it rains. Culturally very interesting town. The Museum of Tales and Science is wonderful. Absolutely recommendable are the sweets and empanadas from the Brígidas nuns."
400756,2650087,5,Quicolas,08/04/2023,"A wide and very flat esplanade of land, all services and a step away from the town center. No shade and half a hassle when it rains which is not the case. New and without delimited spaces, there is the possibility of also parking on grass"
400757,2705517,5,park4nightcv1993,29/04/2023,"Attention, access to the watchtower is not indicated and access is via a small loop set back from the main road. Nice place for a night or two. If you manage to climb the first slopes the rest is rather flat. We saw beautiful eagle flights and the view is sublime. Avoid in high winds."
400757,2680923,5,audreydurandv,19/04/2023,"Small rather chaotic slope to take with a little momentum for the largest motorhomes but it's worth it! The place is amazing, in the pines with a 180 degree view. Spectacular sunset. Super quiet. We were alone. Hard camping table. By putting yourself in the middle you are flat."
400758,3261819,5,RicMarche,05/09/2023,"Lovely place five minutes from the main road, only olive trees around, silence and lots of space available"
400758,2635344,5,Selvaprada,02/04/2023,"There is no reason not to stay here. Nobody comes by here, so remote. For this, no more than 2 campers should park during the day, so that there is also space for other cars. However, it is a sunny Sunday and nobody is around."
400806,2629367,2,AndreasBrodien,29/03/2023,"Well, I don't know if Lidl is that enthusiastic!? Great for shopping, but questionable for parking and overnight! In any case, there is a chain with a lock hanging at the entrance! Maybe just a lock entry?"
400830,3009128,5,Geschenk,23/07/2023,"Very nice, large parking lot. Spent one night alone (as a woman) and felt very safe. The police also made their rounds there and left me. The road is right next to it but separated by a hedge. Residents keep walking past, but they don't bother us."
400830,2636879,4,Rubapple,03/04/2023,Information for weekends: Possibility of open nightclub right next to the parking lot. (it will depend on the time of year).
400835,3102235,3,Supermarta,08/08/2023,"We have been in August and the swamp is low and full of minnow. considering that there are a lot of places to bathe throughout the swamp, this is not one of the best. Regarding the shade, there is not much"
400835,2694217,5,TaijaH,24/04/2023,We spend few days here. It's really beautiful area and you can swim in the lake. There were quite a many people having walks by the shore and herd of cows pass by. But no one in the evenings or nights. Total silence.
400846,3288164,5,GioSchizzo,12/09/2023,"Large marked motorhome parking (10m) right in front of the beach and beach bars, we spent the night there without problem, showers and bathrooms on the beach, town of San Andrés 15 minutes walk, very good and comfortable space to spend a few days in the beach"
400846,3287796,2,martini666,12/09/2023,"Would recommend to continue 10minutes farther to the place at playa gaviotas, much better there. This is too close to the main road and lots of people around and big parking lots like these always bring weird people or young people touring their cars etc."
400846,3226335,2,diggiiiiiiii,27/08/2023,close to beach and showers available (even at night) - drunk teens driving car races at night with loud music on one of the three streets of the very long parking lot. - Very loud compressors?! near the beach. - strange people who are not among the campers on site are sneaking around the vehicles. No feeling of security Parking recommendation: the sand parking lot right next to it (south)
400846,3111694,4,Yerataulfo,09/08/2023,"The beach is very quiet and we liked it. The motorhome parking lots are spacious but they smell of pee, the people in the cars go to relieve themselves next to our motorhomes and a lot of garbage. During the day they usually park cars in the motorhome parking lot. Generally quiet nights."
400846,3018500,3,Guanchemaho,25/07/2023,It is quite good and central to visit the town although the space is in poor condition
400846,2865996,5,DaisyAndOlaf,18/06/2023,"Good place to park, level and very spacious parking next to the beach, there is an area reserved for a motorhome that is at the bottom of the parking lot. Right in front of the “bambú” beach bar, you cannot park anywhere else as they will kick you out. The weekend can be a bit noisy but nothing special. In the morning the garbage truck passes but bearable. Worth ."
400846,2862568,1,fabriziolpa,17/06/2023,"At 12:25 a.m. on Friday, a couple of local police officers woke us up saying that you can't stay overnight here. there were about 7 motorhomes which they sent us to move to the auditorium if we did not want a sanction...."
400846,2775302,4,gonza83,22/05/2023,"Good place to spend the night, quiet, near the beach. A bit noisy after 7 am from people walking and garbage trucks but overall it's ok"
400846,2645619,3,crilerosi,07/04/2023,"The place is very crowded and there is no possibility to park, a lot of tourists on the beach - we drove right back"
400846,2622741,5,veryvague,24/03/2023,Our favorite spot on the island! Try the lunch dishes at the bar at the plaza in the centre of this nice little town. At both plazas you will also find boxes for book exchange.
400853,2623197,5,SusaUndRalfOnTour,25/03/2023,Bordered water source. Very good water. Parking strips directly at the fountain.
400872,2983102,1,anaman,18/07/2023,"Good place to park and spend the night, especially if you want to do the Pico Peña Mea Route"
400893,2648175,5,symaeurope2022,07/04/2023,"Top place for washing the camper! A friendly gentleman came to exchange money so we could do whatever we wanted. 5 programs, spray, wash, rinse."
400902,3199178,4,Txema69,22/08/2023,"Quiet and beautiful place near the river, picnic area with shade, barbecue, water, and municipal swimming pools. On Sundays you CANNOT be there, there is a market."
400904,2714026,5,wurzelsepperl,01/05/2023,Spent a nice and quiet night here. Beautiful views and the possibility to walk down to the sea where there are some natural pools the locals seem to enjoy. Space is quite limited though.
400922,2634178,5,alhoff,01/04/2023,easy stay and enjoy
400954,2653936,4,amsguerrero,09/04/2023,"It is the fairground, if you do not want to enter the town it is a good place, but as I indicated in the comments of the other area of the town, you can spend the night anywhere, it is a quiet town and where motorhome drivers are well received. I am a motorhome driver and owner of one of the many olive tree nurseries."

400961,2695734,5,TaijaH,25/04/2023,Pretty views and level parking lot. The cemetery is not in use so there's basically no traffic. Just few dog walkers in the afternoon.

401045,3052129,5,evaristomrkz,31/07/2023,Very quiet place and good shade. Some person walking in the morning. There is a water source. I hope the site stays as clean as it was.
401051,2642625,5,lbokel,06/04/2023,Very quiet. In the morning and in the evening a few locals who walk their dogs
401092,3077908,5,milopoletti,04/08/2023,"A quiet spot during the week, chaotic at the weekend. During the day, being a tourist place, several people pass by, but at night there is a wonderful silence and in the morning you have the natural swimming pool all to yourself until 9. Suitable for vans, not for tall vehicles."
401092,2943935,2,sk2101,09/07/2023,"The parking lot is not suitable for larger vans due to the small trees and their low dense canopy in between. Since this is our Plan B parking space anyway, we squeezed into the first parking space with the smallest tree in the middle of the night, right next to the overflowing garbage cans."
401105,3037796,4,Borderontour,29/07/2023,"Perfect for sleeping alone, nature, a fountain with water, paths to go for a walk, only a car passes through the night, stable network for teleworking"

Beware of foreigners, they empty gray water on the ground at night, do not move the motorhomes, they come from their countries to dirty ours, and then we pay the consequences, call their attention or report it to the person in charge of the checkpoint, it is It's a shame that such a beautiful place is dirty and has a bad smell."
401124,3262356,4,CarmenFranka,05/09/2023,"For us it is a paradise here. We are self-sufficient. Standing directly on the beautiful beach. Discharge and supply is possible. The driveway was a bit bumpy, but we got through well with our 5 tons. The beach bar is okay, it's enough for a cold beer. We will be back."
401124,3261790,3,Störti01,05/09/2023,You have to see it.
401124,3194853,4,Raulana,21/08/2023,"Spectacular place for a price of 10 euros. The beach bar leaves a little to be desired and the bathrooms and showers are very poorly maintained. Gray and black water can be discharged. To recharge drinking water for 50 cents, 75 liters approx. To spend a couple of days it was luxury for the price they charge."
401124,3169299,3,francescalai,17/08/2023,"Beautiful place and breathtaking view, very large spaces but practically absent services, dilapidated bathrooms, shower too, but I recommend it for a spartan campsite with a spectacular view! (Cost €10)"

The place full of people and not hygienic. We left"
401124,3106674,5,Kevin1192,09/08/2023,"Surprisingly good! Free choice of pitches, no plots. Partial view of the magnificent bay. Not crowded, super sandy beach surrounded by palm trees. Dogs are tolerated on the beach and in the water! A real exception. Showers and toilets didn't watch us, we prefer to use them in the camper. It's camping and not glamping! We're still staying, thanks for this parking space"
401124,3021115,3,jfarenden,25/07/2023,"The lady here was pretty friendly and although she charged us 2euro to go inside, plus 1 Euro for water, she did not charge us the 2 Euro fee the second time I went back for more water that day.
I didn't stay there, just filled up with water.

Not very many people there at this time, but it looked clean, if somewhat basic."
401124,3014149,4,U.Do,24/07/2023,"Fantastic beach with waves, the view of it from the camper. Dog everywhere ok. Great walks. If you value electricity, service, anything else, you should stay away. Unfortunately a lot of flies. Garbage no more than anywhere else. rest at night. Better to stop badmouthing to ban the Womos so that a hotel complex can be built. Better organize the basic supply for Womos in a natural way."
401124,3008046,2,WolliMeyer,23/07/2023,"Actually very nice. Great sea, nice view, nice people but all full of rubbish. The toilets are so disgusting that I can understand why the many Spanish short-term visitors prefer to go to the bushes. As a result, there are really a lot of flies that almost fly into your mouth while you eat. You need 50 cent pieces for showering and disposal."

401124,2731260,5,Krissi1305,07/05/2023,"A brilliant place as long as you are self-sufficient! If you can get a front row seat or make it up the cliffs in your vehicle (took our van) it really is one of the best places to stay for a few days. However, you would rather not use the toilet, shower, supply and disposal."
401124,2730136,5,xebri,07/05/2023,"The location is spectacular, right in front of the beach with nothing else in the background. The terrain is fine, parts with inclines but many are very flat. The showers and the toilet are very tight, we don't use it... clean water recharges with coins, €1/3min. It is a small paradise, very beautiful, regardless of its legal problems or not, which honestly do not matter to me... the area is clean and well-kept."

401124,2723021,5,LCurly,04/05/2023,Very special place with a lot of land where you can park and spend the night in peace. There are several fine sandy beaches. €7.5/24h. The floor is dirt and with some unevenness.

The location is fantastic and if you can get a pitch with a view of the sea, you couldn't be happier be. For us one of the best pitches in Spain! When it rains, however, you don't want to stand here because of the sandy subsoil. The beach is a dream!"
401124,2695576,5,happyholiday2022,25/04/2023,"A really nice spot, nice beach, clean water, toilets are ok, if you expect luxury you'd better go somewhere else, but it's absolutely fine, rolls, fruit come in the car. There are cool people there, but also very precise pensioners. The bad mobile phone reception is very liberating, a wonderful experience in today's world. We would come again. We are a young family"
401124,2692001,4,birgcamp,23/04/2023,A wonderful place... we'd love to come back. And yes: the sanitary facilities/disposal/supply are certainly not optimal. For little money you have a very nice beach parking space with a fantastic view of the sea.
401124,2682287,5,SirArchieWatson,19/04/2023,We were 4 days in the bay of snakes and it was a dream. Hardly any mobile homes and very very little going on. There is not a nudist even 100 meters in the next. There are great routes for hiking and even a small kiosk/bar. There are a lot of dogs there but they are all really cool. From time to time there is a baker who has more than fair prices. We will be back.
401124,2675886,3,ebeabele,16/04/2023,we read euro 7.50 and saw how many campers there were and looked and walked around a bit... and moved on... it definitly didnt seem worth it
401124,2672637,3,LauraJoggerst,15/04/2023,"We stayed here for 2 nights. The location is a dream and deserves 5 stars! Unfortunately, I cannot praise the sanitary facilities. Shower is ok, I found the toilets to be unhygienic - there was no water. The reason why we drove on was the water disposal/filling up: The fresh water hose was used by many campers to flush the toilet, because there was no water anywhere else."
401124,2669007,5,idavantour,14/04/2023,always my pleasure. The first time I just wanted to have a look because of the many comments. I stayed for 2 weeks and met great people during that time. The operator is a sweetheart but all the staff are very friendly and helpful. The toilets and showers are clean. There are rubbish bins everywhere and they are emptied daily. I've been there 3 times now...
401124,2664962,5,ReinerReisdorf,12/04/2023,"The Bay of Snakes... We only wanted to stay a few days... after a week we said goodbye with nostalgia. A special people here, many dropouts and those who spend the winter here. You have to like it, we thought it was great! The bay is fantastic, pretty much out of the way. The pitch is simple, without electricity but supply and disposal is possible. Great for 7.50 a day!"
401124,2654568,4,vanhula,09/04/2023,It's really a nice place to stay for a short while. The price is ok at 6.50 euros!
401124,2646581,4,Festin,07/04/2023,"Dream place, beach and very beautiful surroundings. At the moment you can stay overnight, paying 7e, it seems that they have some conflict with the locals. Perhaps letting the parking lot be organized a little more and facilitating the overnight stay with some other service, they could agree. Many foreigners with long stays at this time, but all very calm. Good bike rides and walking."
401124,2645698,4,Reichelviajes,07/04/2023,Good place to be in front of the beach and enjoy tranquility. Reasonable price. The only drawback is that there is dirt and sand that when it is windy it gets very high and it is uncomfortable. rest very well.
401124,2643494,5,AngieLu,06/04/2023,"The much-described snake bay. Some love them, others hate them. I can only say DREAMLIKE AND UNIQUE. The people I met there were unique. The bay is beautiful and since I originally just wanted to take a look and then stayed for two weeks, that speaks for itself. I could have stayed longer, but at some point we'll just move on."
401124,2635621,5,Beppomann,02/04/2023,"Nice place, friendly staff! Small food truck, 30 l of water €0.50! No electricity!"

401342,3239564,3,joseleramon,30/08/2023,"The machine to empty sewage costs €3. It is true that you already put the liquid and water in the tank but it is not worth it. There are other better emptying points at no cost. In addition, the water filling is a hose that does not cut off when you stop filling and a lot of water is wasted."

401399,2708911,5,Laguti89,30/04/2023,Thanks to the Town Halls for giving us a space and thus the opportunity to get to know the area. It would be more comfortable if it was paved and had trees to provide shade in the hot months. It has all the comforts and is easy to find.

401418,3233907,3,BWP,29/08/2023,Municipal area well designed. Leveled pitches. Walking or cycling path right next to it. Unfortunately if you want to rest this is not the right place. Music from the restaurant until late at night and children screaming unable people from sleeping.
401418,3226975,5,ulaexpo,27/08/2023,The place is spectacular. Picnic area next to the shaded area. We simply empty and fill. The filling and emptying area is 50 meters from the area. Next to the municipal swimming pools and the bar. A little far from the town.

Good trees for shade on one side. but the music from restaurant on (although low) from around 10 and it’s close to road so you can hear cars, cyclist & passerby chatting. (hence the 4* although could well be 5*). In any case, thank you to the municipality for building such a lovely stop for camper and motorhomes."

Very nice host, speaks German, English, Spanish, Portuguese."

Between those who play tennis screaming until 2.30 am and those who think they are on an F1 circuit… not to mention the lighting of the area by floodlights which go out at 6 am in the morning. Not restful night"

A few passages where I felt the van skid a little. Can 1 or 2 passages that it is better to pass in dry weather. No shade and windy. A few cyclists and walkers. The sky was cloudy so no beautiful sunset.

The owner offered us an evening tour and tasting which we really appreciated. He is keen to share the quality of his organic olive oil and its production. We also enjoyed a good Portuguese meal presented in a pretty basket.
401848,3288021,5,Finn27,12/09/2023,"Went there for one night and were given an incredibly warm welcome. A beautiful place where we felt very comfortable and had everything we needed. Of course there are flies and the like on a natural olive farm, but for us it wasn't bothersome at all. The homemade Portuguese dinner and breakfast were to die for. Something very special!"
401848,3284523,3,hjsi10,11/09/2023,lovely stop but had been camping wild so was not used to so many mororhomes.  its a working organic olive oil farm.. so no chemicals ..  good oil but  means ants and flies so we couldn't sit out.  the neighbours dogs are unfortunately very noisy.  the washing could only be done at 30° and I like 40°  after 1 hour drying the washing was still wet so I think they need to invest in new machines.
401848,3283062,5,galice42,11/09/2023,"Really very good, we found this place great, sleeping in the middle of the olive trees, José and his wife are really very nice and their olive oil is a treat, ask to do the visit, a short hour to learn about olive oil , and price question, nothing to say. the neighbor's dogs yes a little in the evening but really not disturbing. I advise you to stay at this place"
401848,3280264,5,JFM89,10/09/2023,Super friendly hosts. Shower and toilet are newly made and super clean. You can also book dinner and breakfast. Sleeping with your camper right between olive trees was unique and romantic at the same time. We also got a guided tour of the olive oil factory and bought a few liters of olive oil. Thank you for everything.
401848,3255568,5,LisbethImNorden,03/09/2023,"H can only say: WOW! I absolutely love this place! We initially planned to only stay one night, but within the first hour we decided to stay longer. You can easily find the olive plantation using Google Maps. The access is large and spacious, so you won't have any problems even with larger motorhomes. Unlike other places, the path is solid and there is no risk of getting stuck. Everything is available, from electricity to showers to washing machines. But that's not what's special about this place. You stand in the middle of an olive plantation surrounded by nature! You are completely undisturbed and have space for yourself. Because the spaces are demarcated and very spacious, you don't notice any neighbors. But now to the highlight of this place: The owners are just incredibly nice and warm. We were warmly greeted by the father and his daughter and shown to our place. We were immediately offered the self-prepared dinner and breakfast the next morning, which we gratefully accepted. We were also told about the free tour of the plantation the next morning. Dinner costs €15 per person and breakfast costs €6. It was really delicious and served in traditional Portuguese plates. It is important to mention that the parking spaces are free. An absolute recommendation for anyone who values nature, good food and warm hosts. Thank you!"

I hope to be back some time and would highly recommend staying here."
401848,3154941,4,GregMarjo,15/08/2023,"Personally, we found the €15 meal far too expensive compared to the content. Apart from this the setting is fabulous in the middle of the olive trees, the hosts are very kind and fluent in French, English and Portuguese. Free pitch, shower or electricity €2. We understand pk the meals and breakfast are a bit expensive because that's the top ''they find themselves there despite everything we advise!"

402075,3191115,3,piervi,21/08/2023,Ideal parking for those who want to visit Granada. It offers many services and is very spacious. The staff is very courteous and easy communication via whatsapp. To get to and from Granada we used taxis (just over 10 euros).
402075,3168001,4,DeniseMicCas,17/08/2023,"rest area served with electricity, toilets and spotless showers. in the evening we slept well. as flaws we have ropes at the top that you can hardly see which can damage the camper and nearby there is a landfill, so be aware of a bit of a stench. otherwise it is a good place. you get to the city by bus which you take near the camper 7 m."
402075,3157529,3,brablc,16/08/2023,Perfect for Granada visit. Toilets and showers clean. Night lights too bright and too many - no way to avoid. Drinking water somewhere outside the court. Wifi credentials not stated anywhere.
402075,3115182,2,cagatedosso,10/08/2023,"surrounded by concrete walls, which raise the heat to an unlivable level, more suitable for storage than a rest area. friendly staff, but once we saw the place we decided to go elsewhere. otherwise it's fine, but I wouldn't recommend it"
402075,3066292,4,Pippo75i,03/08/2023,"Excellent location for visiting Granada clean services and showers, good communication, shade towels, perhaps a little impersonal and anonymous, however for one night it's fine"

402075,2955292,3,bessymaxemily,12/07/2023,Good access to Granada with Uber/taxi or bus. Very basic but clean toilets and showers. Electric and shade. We didn’t use drinking water as it’s touching toilet hose. Services past car wash and play park. Wouldn’t say super secure although has code and key. Good for what we needed which was close access to Granada. Bit of an odd industrial estate
402075,2931451,3,lostresvanenvan,06/07/2023,"A very basic area. For what it is, I find it expensive. It is close to the city of Granada but the environment is very polygonal and does not invite you to take a walk around. We have not found the place to empty gray water inside. If you don't venture to sleep in Granada capital, that's fine."
402075,2897481,4,Gordi21,27/06/2023,"Clean and well-kept area, with awnings over the squares and common areas to be. Silent at night. Bus stop at the crossroads of the road with Alfacar to go down to Granada in 15'. It has all the services. friendly staff."

402075,2866924,1,chenita,18/06/2023,"This is what it is, a parking lot to leave the motorhome throughout the year and a parking lot that is not for sleeping, with small spaces, and a bad combination of buses."
402075,2852286,5,iCastan,14/06/2023,"Excellent area to visit Granada! Very close to the bus stop, very quiet area and you have all the services, electricity, showers, draining and filling of water... Mariam, the owner, very attentive and giving facilities for everything! Highly recommended, to repeat !!"
402075,2804203,4,sabine1968,30/05/2023,Do not rely on the industrial side of the area. Certainly no view but very well equipped including showers. Welcoming staff but beware little information about buses to the center. A bus is taken (and leaves you on the way back) in front of the entrance to the area and a bus is taken at the bottom of the descent in front of an iron gate. Terminus 40 mins walk from the Alhambra. Return from the same stop.
402075,2778136,5,pioubou,23/05/2023,"Very good location for motorhome and van, we arrived in the evening and no problem, very nice staff, I recommend"
402075,2769863,4,CarlosMarcelo,21/05/2023,"It is the best thing to get to know Granada, the services are there, the bathroom is unique and shared and the light is due to movement, so when you bathe it goes out and you end up bathing in the dark, the gray and black water tanks are just a 200 mtrs at the entrance of a workshop not easy to find, I insist the only thing that is good for Granada"
402075,2750526,3,cheislo,15/05/2023,"Area without more to visit Granada. Dwarf plots, you can not remove chairs. darling"
402075,2739460,4,vod80,10/05/2023,"A slightly strange setting in an industrial area but very secure and super clean toilets/showers. The manager is very laid back and very helpful. Easy access to the city crntre using the No103 bus - there is no bus stop as such, just flag the bus down on the main street. Taking a taxi back far easier and only 10€. A good spot!"
402075,2735201,5,roger34500,08/05/2023,"Quiet Weird when you see the neighborhood. But good surprise super supervised very pleasant practice. The bus is a bit weird, no list on the stops, right when you get out in Jun and after, worry about it when you don't speak Spanish. Very clean place tables wc showers at 20 € per 24h00 Outside after the tavern EG EN emptying and free water filling"
402075,2730988,1,Lamartine,07/05/2023,"Went back as soon as we saw the place. Dirty industrial area, rubbish littered the street just before entering. Bad impression, we left for the south of Granada."
402075,2725760,3,Strix,05/05/2023,"Agree for reception, cleanliness, security. Ideal for visiting the Cartuja (<3km). But: noisy all the time because of a refrigeration unit, temperature too high at night, frequent industrial smells. We didn't stay more than one night."
402075,2721274,5,jodelo77,04/05/2023,"Very well equipped motorhome area, do not rely on the entrance where cars are stored. Modern and very clean sanitary facilities, tables and chairs available. The owner is very friendly and very helpful. To get to Granada 2 solutions, taxi at 11€ or bus 103 at 5 minutes journey about 18 minutes plaza libertad near the center. We stayed 2 nights."
402075,2714659,5,tilly56,01/05/2023,"Very nice motorhome, with a taxi to Granada for 11 euros. Friendly and helpful owners. One of the best stays around Granada. We strongly recommend this."
402075,2712961,5,Montanerosviaje,01/05/2023,Ideal for visiting Granada. On the main road you can stop a yellow bus that leaves you in the center in 15 minutes. Or a taxi for around €11. If you call the autocamper phone they can send you information with bus schedules and taxi phone numbers. The bathrooms are spacious and with 24-hour hot water. The squares have awnings that provide shade.
402075,2699209,5,mieric,26/04/2023,Very good for 1 or 2 nights. Very friendly staff. Buses and taxis nearby.

The bus runs every 10 minutes, there is a pet-friendly taxi driver and for 11/12 Euros she took us to the center of Granada. There are awnings in all the squares, so when one of the days we left the puppy, we left without worrying because they also have surveillance. The place is quiet, nice staff and all inclusive. We will be back!."
402075,2691427,2,peka55,23/04/2023,"Nice and very helpful staff. Good bus connection to get to Granada. Safe place because fenced. What bothered us a lot during the night was a clearly audible unit or a nearby fan that was constantly switching on and off, so that a restful sleep was not possible for us. Therefore only 2 stars."
402075,2681468,1,birgcamp,19/04/2023,"I can only agree with Ulisontour's assessment of April 17, 2023. Cafeteria, toilet in cafeteria and car wash available."

402075,2679155,5,dimafeo,18/04/2023,"A reasonable parking space with sun protection for almost every parking space. To get into town, you just have to walk to the street in front. The bus also stops there directly at the crossing. There is no bus stop sign, but it still works perfectly. Showers and toilets are clean. Friendly staff."
402075,2677927,1,ulisontour,17/04/2023,"Actually no star at all - we can't understand the good reviews. The site is in an industrial area, completely concreted and tightly fenced. In front of it a bus parking lot, a car wash and an old industrial hall. Unfortunately, there are not many other alternatives in and around Granada - but here it is at best a parking space without any quality of stay."

402075,2674330,2,lupo.orso,16/04/2023,"Good place to stand safely in Granada with electricity. However: far from the centre, in a suburban valley, narrow places, hot almost cold water from the shower, a very dilapidated and dirty loading and unloading place outside, badly signposted, in an old factory now used as a camper deposit. Very kind staff."
402075,2671601,5,HappyFamily2020,15/04/2023,"Newly created area. Highly recommended. We arrived at night with 2 girls and without any problem he gave us instructions by phone to access the area.

He gets a 10/10 along with space. We put a 4 because the bathrooms were not clean at all and the water pressure in the shower was weak. You can walk to the town and beaches. Charming town with very good places to dine and have a drink.
402150,3227894,4,Inexitah,27/08/2023,"We stayed 2 nights at this location. We were very well received by the lady. Simple installations, but that fulfill the objectives. Recent space, expanding. About 10 minutes from the beach, shops, etc. I liked it and recommend it."
402150,3222279,5,LukeJarvis,26/08/2023,It's one of the few places in the south where you feel good. The owners are lovely and you have everything you need. You can easily walk to Burgau where you have the beach and restaurants. The only downside is that there is no shade. The toilets could be cleaner but it's not because of the managers more because of the people who don't pay attention
402150,3215265,5,sjwilsonuk,25/08/2023,Great find. Very good nights sleep. The shops and beach very short walk. Owners are super freindly. Added to my favourites and will defo return  .

Good for one stop, but a bit overpriced for just a simple parking space! Also when we were there it was really windy, there is no wind protection so we could barely cook with our gas cooker..."
402150,3065046,5,jblas,02/08/2023,A highly recommended site. Everything very neat and clean. The owners were very nice and did their best to make us feel good. The Area is 10 min walk from the beach. The night very quiet.
402150,3054430,5,agudogo77,31/07/2023,"A fantastic area. Close to Sagres, Lagos, Cape San Vicente, ......... I recommend it 100%. well leveled. Free shower. Grey waters. Filled with water. Spectacular attention. Beach 15 minutes walk"
402150,3053303,4,DavidGferriz,31/07/2023,Perfect for a stopover. You can enter at night and the pitches have electricity. Correct bathroom and showers. Very attentive and friendly staff.

402150,3022962,5,gzhndmrc,26/07/2023,Perfect camping to stay! Very quiet and clean toilet&showers. Close to beach only 13 min by walking and beach is also very calm and water is very clean. There are also nice restaurants and mini markets nearby. Camping owners are very friendly and helpful. We strongly recommend!
402150,3019809,5,AnniMika,25/07/2023,"I stood here for a few weeks. The family who owns the place are super nice and help where they can. It's super quiet and the beach is in walking distance. If you like Indian restaurants, both Indians in town are a big recommendation"
402150,3012990,5,van_madness,24/07/2023,"Super nice operator! As everyone has written before, the place has everything you need and the toilets and showers are clean. If you don't want to walk, you can always take your luggage and everything to the beach for €10. You just have to call back if you want to be picked up. We would stand here again at any time. Thanks very much!"
402150,3012886,5,joaljoal,24/07/2023,"Everything perfect and super attentive, an excellent stay! It has bathrooms, water and many plots."

402150,3004771,5,mecawyner,23/07/2023,"Recently opened area, very friendly owners. So much so, that in the end we stayed 3 nights, due to the proximity of the beach (less than 10 minutes), super quiet and sheltered from the wind. We also had a problem with the van, and they helped us with everything, for several hours. I can't do anything but recommend this area, we will definitely be back. Overwhelmed by everything!"
402150,2991100,5,forgotmybenutzername,20/07/2023,"A great place, even if there is still a lot under construction. Super nice owners and within walking distance to the beach and the small town. There is a supermarket and a few restaurants in the village. The site has electricity, hot showers, toilets and a washing machine. Due to the many parking spaces, you can also spontaneously find a free space here"
402150,2986630,5,MeKr,19/07/2023,Very well located parking space. It's a 10 minute walk to the beach. Also in the small town of Burgau with shops and small bars. Super nice owners who are very helpful. Very clean. 2 days became 7 days.
402150,2984583,3,Gijon,18/07/2023,"Good for the initiative of an area, close to an interesting town with a nice beach. The place is windy and it becomes annoying as the ground is made of stone and earth. The owner confirms that he will not make a standard platform for greys, cleanses and blacks and replaces it with a rustic evacuation system. the water intake is hose. Fine ( and expensive ) for one day. ."
402150,2982660,5,tania1990,18/07/2023,"The attention of the boy is 10. €4 only filling and emptying the water. There are sinks to clean clothes and washing machines. There are also bathrooms. Without a doubt, if I return to this place, I will return."

402150,2964698,4,Bakwagenlover,14/07/2023,"We stayed 2 nights. Everything tiptop, walking distance to the beach, good shower.. could a bit cleaner though :) but overall definitely worth a visit! Washing clothes is 5 euro"

Great restaurants, highly recommend Indian on the way down to the beach. Were 5 days, Lagos in 15-20 minutes by scooter or car. We will be back. Thanks to the owners."
402150,2934087,5,YAKONETA,07/07/2023,"An extraordinary place, an unbeatable treatment. The son of the Extraordinary Manager left me tools to put up the awning. we will definitely be back. Thank you"

402150,2918387,5,SteveDowney,03/07/2023,Arrived 3 July 2023. Great location and access only €16 per night with electric you will require a two pin plug adapter. Toilet and showers not the best but perfectly acceptable. If you are in the area it’s a great place to stopover. One thing to be aware off is the road in is a bit uneven so drive slowly
402150,2903015,5,ouca,28/06/2023,"Clean, secure, friendly… Close to city center and beach. Recommended !"
402150,2902826,5,dottyjo,28/06/2023,The operator was very friendly. Has everything you need. Toilets are clean. Were there 2 nights. would come again We also found the price reasonable.
402150,2902785,4,wildehilde1994,28/06/2023,We spent one night here. There was a lack of shade in the hot weather and in general the place looked like it was still being completed. The sanitary facilities were ok and there was a large washing machine for 5 euros in coins that the operators changed for us!
402150,2900112,5,radiovctive,28/06/2023,"We loved it, the girl who served us was super friendly, the atmosphere in general is super nice, the showers are quite clean and with hot water and for the price you pay per night (€14 for 2 people and 1 camper) you have access to the washing machines also. We came to spend one night but we will stay today too!"
402150,2899074,5,Anacollado,27/06/2023,"We have loved very comfortable and super friendly staff. The hot showers, light, the super comfortable washing machine and the very large pitches. We will be back !!!"
402150,2893671,3,Cookiesmonster,26/06/2023,"Area CC, under construction, the car park is paved with everything coming and it is well leveled, without shade, under the rage of the summer sun. Draining gray water in a not very practical mason's gamate. WC, hot shower. We were well received. 14 euros for one night 2 p 1 CC is expensive but given the scarcity of areas, they take advantage of it…"
402150,2883349,5,Alonja,23/06/2023,"Really great! The place is still under construction, so still very raw and not finished. Nevertheless, everything that is needed is there: fresh water, waste water, toilet, shower, even washing machines. The owners are incredibly warm and helpful. Burgau is a very sweet little village - we loved it!"
402150,2882225,5,GuidoSteph,22/06/2023,"A real tip! Rarely full with shower, toilet, fresh and waste water .... Very good starting point to stop by everywhere. Pedro and his sister do a great job - always there and very helpful. Plus cool, quiet Burgau on top - we were going to stay 1 night - it ended up being 4! -:) Lovely again!!!"
402150,2880119,5,Tamara.vb,22/06/2023,New camper place that is still being optimized. Neatly set up with nice amenities. Very friendly owner!
402150,2870420,5,Hobbyoptima,19/06/2023,"Very nice and friendly. As already described, the place is still under construction. doesn't bother. The pizza in the city (10 minutes walk) tastes delicious."
402150,2842500,4,jd07,11/06/2023,The site is well located although it is seen that it is beginning. the very nice boy. The only thing that needs to be improved is the cleanliness of the bathrooms.
402150,2839185,5,troll17,10/06/2023,"Basic area, well organized, rural, everything you need. Above all, very quiet, without noise, and very close to the small town and beach. We did the fishermen's route, walking along the coast to Luz. They were 3 relaxing days."
402150,2836822,5,sotu,09/06/2023,"Perfect welcome and a super quiet night. The showers are certainly not 5 stars - but it's also just a cheap parking space and not a hotel, in a good location. Should we be in the vicinity again - anytime again."
402150,2835874,5,dani2004,09/06/2023,"One night turned into 4 nights. As already described, the place is brand new and the operator is very friendly. The place is very quiet and has a beautiful landscape. Perfect for relaxing. In 10 minutes you are in the nice little town with small restaurants and bars, a nice atmosphere and a beautiful beach. We felt very comfortable with Pedro."
402150,2832278,5,PergeotBoxerSammy94,08/06/2023,"8th June 2023. Stayed here three nights. Lovely new campsite for motor homes. Only been open since May, but they are doing a great job so far. Really lovely family run place , very helpful and friendly. Hot showers and toilet block. Washer and dryer. Only 10 mins stroll into town where there are lovely restaurants and a great beach. Thank you. Would definitely return. X"
402150,2830362,5,silivanili,07/06/2023,"Very spacious space. Since this has only recently opened, a lot is still being worked on. A washing station (washing / drying) was just being set up during our stay. The siblings who run the place are very courteous and personable. We would come back in a heartbeat. By the way.... The town of Burgau can be reached within 10 minutes on foot."
402150,2826084,3,flaedi,06/06/2023,"Large square with plenty of parking, great location to explore Burgau. For us, however, it does not deserve more than 3 stars: Sanitary and supply are very rudimentary. 2 of 4 toilets were broken, water from the shower tray overflows quickly, there are hoses and open pipes everywhere, and there is a bad smell near the pipes. Space has potential, but still has the character of a construction site."
402150,2816217,4,LeonieundAlex1511,03/06/2023,"Beautiful campsite totally in the nature and close to a dreamlike place. The owner said that the place has only been there for 1 month. Therefore, everything is still new and one or the other construction site can still be seen. Sanitary facilities new, but also expandable. What bothered us here was that you didn't have a private room to shower and store things. But all in all it has potential!"
402150,2791379,5,travellervan,27/05/2023,"Beautiful spot with very nice owners. Spent two nights there, 3 people with a large camper €18 with electricity. Value for money fits. Sanitary facilities modern and clean. At the back of the square is a small enclosure with small goats. All in all we were very satisfied and would come back immediately."
402150,2791035,4,angelabergsma,27/05/2023,"Quiet, clean and friendly staff. It is still under renovation but a nice place to stand. A dishwashing place with warm water would be a nice addition~"
402150,2783803,4,Skippy49,25/05/2023,"A beautiful future area when it is finished Showers with curtains which is not the most insulating. At night dogs bark, prefer to park downstairs. Otherwise well placed for the beach and the charming little village with many restaurants. Emptying into a gamatte which flows into a pipe... In the sector, there is no other choice. 14 € without electricity is a bit expensive all the same."
402150,2775355,5,Simba56,22/05/2023,"05/22/23: we spent a quiet night, 4 motorhomes and our van, so few people. Very good at this time, remains to be seen for the sanitary facilities in high season (2 showers and 2 toilets per gender. Friendly welcome"

402150,2768846,4,Seline13432,20/05/2023,"Had a quiet night over there. 
It's really spacious.
The toilets and showers need some improvement, but it's still alright. 
it's a little bit pricey, but I would still recommend."
402150,2765128,3,trevorf,19/05/2023,"Has the potential to be 5* but not yet finished. No drive over drain for waste water. Fresh water fill up point is the same as chemical toilet dump - not good. Showers are not private and in flimsy cabin. Over priced at €14   €4 for electric. 
Good points - flat hard standing with plenty of room. Very quiet location for good night's sleep. 10 minutes walk to town and beach."
402150,2759943,5,peter1000,18/05/2023,"a super place for camper mobiles. with everything you need. In 10 walking minutes you are in a charming little village, with a wonderful beach. In the village there is a small supermarket and many restaurants. This is the place you want to come back to."
402150,2745491,4,FrankLa,13/05/2023,"Quiet, nice place. Little shade since new. Washing machine and dryer not yet connected. Showers and toilets very clean. Not far to town and to the beach. We recommend the place"

402150,2727830,4,Reiziger14,06/05/2023,"Basic place, I don't quite understand the rave 5 star reviews. It's a great place, electricity optional. No drinking water available. The toilet block, although new, needs improvement. The shower is very small and you have little privacy because of the shower curtain and you have to hang your things outside. No soap at the sink. Restaurants and beach within walking distance."
402150,2727330,4,ChrisMoggy,06/05/2023,"Nicely located a 5 minutes bike ride from a pretty beach in the village. A few restaurants, café and bars to choose from. The park up is a big gravel car park with basic toilet, shower and washing up facilities. It's nice that we don't have to pay for electricity that we don't need. Friendly staff who reacted promptly when told there was no more soap in toilets."
402150,2716043,5,parkmike,02/05/2023,"newly created place, about 1km to the beach and a small town with nice bars and restaurants. Shower, toilet is basic but clean and included in the price. Totally quiet at night. Operator speaks good English and is very helpful. 1 washing machine and a dryer are available and should be connected next week. We liked it."
402150,2714886,4,CATHOUGEGE,01/05/2023,very well located. Well received. clean showers and toilets. lack of shade. Under construction. Calm

402150,2707300,5,jlacacho,29/04/2023,If you are looking for a few days of tranquility and silence this is the right place. Basic but sufficient facilities. It is new with which they continue to put things in motion. A walk to a small town and its beach. Totally recommended
402150,2703065,5,Claue78,28/04/2023,"Very quiet and still> 1km to Burgau and the beach. Small things can still be improved, but the course has only recently opened. Super nice reception."
402150,2701891,4,phildenech,27/04/2023,"2 nights on site, warm welcome, very well placed for the surrounding villages, beautiful walks along the coast. However, to review the gray water system not practical."
402150,2698133,5,thilotravels,26/04/2023,"We had five lovely days here. Extended again and again, but to be fair you have to say that in the area there is hardly any other possibility to stand legally. The place was opened 2 weeks ago. Washing machines not yet connected. Little things can be improved (bigger bins, different toilet lids, a stable shower temperature). With children the way to the beach is ok."
402150,2698037,5,Jumi1983,26/04/2023,"a very nice and clean place with a very friendly operator, here you can enjoy the peace and quiet and the starry sky in the evening. The town of Burgau can be easily reached on foot. The course has only recently opened, we wish it every success."

402150,2694541,5,Tonipovik,24/04/2023,Very cordial attention. The area is about to end and for now without shadows. Correct price since it includes all WC and shower services. The town is beautiful to visit and walk the coastal path.

402150,2675292,5,KlaraLuise,16/04/2023,"Very nice new place, from which you can easily walk to the small town of Burgau. You can't beat the price and you get ample space, clean toilets and showers, and soon likely washing machines (these have just been installed). We stayed longer than planned :)"
402150,2674237,5,RayH.,16/04/2023,We are currently working hard on the space for the washing machines. A 10-minute walk from the beautiful bay of Burgau where there are nice restaurants. For us a great location with potential .... can become a paradise because the manager has big plans.
402150,2663570,4,vittel,12/04/2023,"we spent 2 pleasant days visiting the surroundings. area that will progress as development progresses. nice site and close to everything. a small flat for the emptying of gray water, the system not quite developed given the maneuvers to be done to dump. I think he will figure it out soon enough. Otherwise I strongly recommend."

Breathtaking views from the park up! We left with 2kg of avocados! The road and track to the farm is a little rough but with our 6m van going slow, no problems. Will definitely be back x"

402499,2685914,5,tomeuijero,21/04/2023,"We were there one evening from April 8 to 9. And we found it to be a very quiet area. The very friendly owners advised us about the avocados they grow. In addition, with the donations they intend to condition the area a little more, we think that there can be a very, very good place for camper vans. If we return to the area, we will repeat."
402499,2658533,5,realsurvival,10/04/2023,"Very nice surroundings, good area for base camp and riding bikes and on foot through the mountains. Very nice views of the entire Gulf of Valencia if it is clear, 25 minutes from Puçol/Puig beach, which are very clean and quiet. At the moment there are no facilities or great amenities but there are special seasonal fruits and vegetables. a place to return"
402499,2654743,5,gandarik,09/04/2023,"Perfect place to explore the hinterland - unique setting. We were supplied with fresh avocados straight from the farm. You should definitely be able to stand independently, as there is no electricity, toilets or showers."
402506,3038360,5,lissch93,29/07/2023,Good place for stay for a night! It’s near to the street but not too disturbing.
402506,2994638,3,Locke0601,20/07/2023,You could easily stand by the water here for one night. Level gravel parking lot where we stood with 5 other vans. The street can still be heard in the evening.

402506,2721354,5,sverabe,04/05/2023,a wonderful place! You fall asleep to the sound of waves and wake up to it. We were the only ones except for a few anglers and couples who wanted to enjoy the sunset. Gladly again
402506,2672659,2,CFam,15/04/2023,The place looks nice and the waves are lovely but it’s at the back of a fish wholesale place and a huge truck was there from 4 am until 8 am with the fridge going on. Let’s say we couldn’t even hear the loud waves anymore. At 8 the garbage truck came by and honked multiple times. BRIEFLY: HORRIBLE TO SLEEP.
402506,2671100,2,safaakevin,15/04/2023,"Sublime spot with a magnificent view, we spent the night there lulled by the sound of the waves. But unfortunately we were woken up at 5:30 am by the engine noises of the trucks which were running non-stop to unload the goods at the fishmonger's right next door… What a pity!!!"
402506,2649748,5,AndreaLongo,08/04/2023,"The place is amazing and very quiet, we were in 4 and there were still room left for parking"

402513,3065345,5,stopplay,02/08/2023,"Friendly area in a pretty village, free drain water. It is located along a very small road, you really have to be a bitch to complain about such a pretty and above all free area. it is in any case much more welcoming than its neighbor near the highway."
402513,3011977,5,johnboyparknight,24/07/2023,"Amazing that such a small sleepy village can still provide motorhome parking with shade, water and waste points. Next to the road yeh but it’s far from what you’d describe as busy - the sparrows in the trees make more noise"
402513,2912237,4,josebusangel,01/07/2023,"New 4-seater area with water loading and unloading services and picnic tables. There is a catch, the 7.50 m cars do not take in all the places and the branches of the trees are also a nuisance due to the height of our vehicles, since they can give us a displeasure if they are not well controlled. Thanks to the council, I don't want it to be seen as a criticism, more like an improvement."
402513,2763409,2,Redvan1,19/05/2023,alongside a busy road! Not suitable for young children. And at the moment (19-05) they are renovating a house next door with lots of noise. Town seems very nice

402542,2692991,3,alfi17,24/04/2023,nice beach but be aware only day parking. We were moved by the military at 8pm who patrol the beach throughout the night. Told us to park in the town car park. We also had a young guy hanging around our van during the day which was uncomfortable.
402545,2877545,3,soizpic,21/06/2023,"Very nice to spend the day there, but it is forbidden to stay there at night, because it is a military area. We were kindly dislodged during dinner. We went to the large parking lot at the port that the soldier recommended to us."
402545,2797840,1,MementoVivere,29/05/2023,"Please note: the course is located in a military zone. The facility supposedly described as a police station is the marine station. Standing during the day is absolutely no problem, the view is great! In the evening we were kindly but firmly asked by the military to leave the site."
402553,2661688,2,rvgoa,11/04/2023,"Thank you for the info. Spacious and quiet parking next to the swimming pool. On the way to Compostela, a small town to discover. Lots of pilgrims. Magnificent altarpiece in the church. Above the church, 360° view of the region. Resto El Molino menu del Dia."
402554,3290629,4,jcanalitos,13/09/2023,"We parked during the day 3 times, spacious and quiet. It seems like a good place to spend the night in the summer when the school is closed."
402558,2669058,3,PatetCor,14/04/2023,superb place to spend the night and take the 10 km track go by motorbike to reach the village of Finestras and its famous wall (must see) I did not dare to go further by CC too many speed bumps for runoff

402560,3276673,5,Eole39,09/09/2023,"Great places we like, a city that knows how to welcome campers. Quiet, serviced parking with open views is all free of charge. We took the opportunity to do our shopping"

402560,3253171,4,Vikcente,03/09/2023,Phenomenal area. At 10 minutes from the center. Beautiful views of the town with an area for picnic tables and barbecues. With filling and emptying services that worked well. We slept wonderfully and recommend it. Thanks to the city of Luarca for facilitating AC tourism. I don't give it 5 stars because of the dirt and grass floor that gets muddy when it rains. We spent the night on 08/26/2023.
402560,3246382,4,sveigasalgado,01/09/2023,"Well located area to visit Luarca. Wooden tables and barbecues. Free services. There is no shade and I imagine the area will be a muddy field with rain. Stuck emptying black on September 1. There are people who empty the cassette into the clean water grate, instead of finding another nearby area to do it correctly and keep the facility clean for everyone to enjoy."

402560,3230568,5,Nilma,28/08/2023,"Area with all water loading and unloading services. About 15 minutes from the fishing port. The area is on grass or mud. Thanks to the town hall for allowing us to eat, buy some things and see their beautiful town."
402560,3226412,3,fixmmgg,27/08/2023,"Good place to stop to know Luarca. The town 10 minutes walk. The super quiet night, not a single noise, despite passing the road next to it. Correct filling and emptying area. As a negative, the muddy area is so large, it loses a lot by not having a cemented or gravelly floor."
402560,3202128,5,RitxiAzzena,22/08/2023,A luxury. 5 minutes from town and super quiet.
402560,3201550,3,AnaOrtega,22/08/2023,"Comfortable Area close to a hill (10 minutes) from the center of Luarca. Closer place than parking 3, which was the one we had before. Today was the day of the big party and we did not fit in the Area, we have placed ourselves and Several more outside but occupying only one car space. No problems. A bit muddy place."
402560,3189087,2,Tanruz,20/08/2023,"Muddy, we didn't stay."
402560,3179850,4,pequesport,19/08/2023,"The parking lot is dirt and parks more than 10 motorhomes, outside the motorhome parking there are more spaces for cars. Be careful not to comply with the rules (especially stopping in the exclusive area for authorized people), there are some neighbors at the other end (near the emptying) who call the police at the minimum or go down to attract attention."
402560,3174857,3,joanjo,18/08/2023,"Ideal area to visit Luarca. The terrain is not paved but it is leveled. The water change area is in fairly good condition, although you have to back up to access it as it is located in the car park. There is quite a hill to get there."

402560,3138564,3,AsisTriano,13/08/2023,"It is appreciated that the town has a free area where you can park. That being said, the area is small and difficult to maneuver depending on the size and how crowded it is. the service area is in the car parking area. The walk to the town is about 20 minutes, the return is all uphill. We decided to go to sleep somewhere else."
402560,3136851,4,Rocega,13/08/2023,"Adequate space although with a long slope to go down and walk up to the town. Sometimes very crowded, it seems related to the sun forecasts."

402560,3095243,3,RC1003,07/08/2023,"It is appreciated that they set up sites for us, but I have the feeling that they take us as low-class tourism. Always in remote places, from land... where we are not seen much... as if we were in the way. This is one of those places, after a good slope, in a corner of dirt and overcrowded. There are very good areas, but this is not."
402560,3081959,5,VLC82,05/08/2023,"place near of Luarca train station. You can visit the town walking (10 min aprox). If the area is complete, you can park around without problems. the police visited the area two times."

If you can get a front row seat, you're in luck with a good view and 4 picnic tables and grills. There will also be places available in the afternoon and early evening, so don't give up too early. The place is busy, the western beach is beautiful."
402560,3023059,4,jobeanpa,26/07/2023,A very quiet area despite being next to the train station. A little far from the town but it is a walk. The worst is the dirt floor with herbs. The unloading area is a bit removed to avoid bad odors and the picnic tables are a hit

The floor is dirt with grass... it scares me with a couple of rainy days. Nice view of the upper part of the city from here. Next door is the train station, but it has little frequency and is not bothersome."

In addition, the tables and trash cans were probably all newly set up. Unfortunately, the rain prevented us from using the new tables. The barbecue areas also look great, but were not allowed to be used due to the risk of fire."
402560,2719225,5,CalViudo,03/05/2023,"We were there on the night of 12/04/2023. Completely new area with water filling and emptying services separate from the car park. Next to the station, it is very quiet and peaceful. Away from the center but with very good scenery. Thanks to the city council."
402560,2711049,5,hughmacken,30/04/2023,"What a lovely peaceful site for an overnight stay! Luarca itself is very charming, with lots of lovely bars and a cute harbour. Not sure if fishing is still the main activity but a wander around the shops and a walk up to the cemetery is well worthwhile. The site is very clean and has bbq points and basic services. It’s free so what is there to complain about. Highly recommended."
402560,2704226,5,mb56,28/04/2023,"Thank you for accepting us, we went down to have an aperitif on the lively port, very quiet and very clean area."
402560,2684254,4,kalmapossl,20/04/2023,"There is a problem with Black's drain, as it doesn't swallow and overflows elsewhere, which makes it a mess. I think it is more of a bad maintenance and not a bad use, since it makes a stopper. We chose not to use it seeing how it was. We have notified the town hall of this. For the rest, nice town 10 minutes walk. Quiet area and nice views."
402560,2683200,1,Thurston,20/04/2023,"Absolutely revolting example of filthy human behaviour. The town looks lovely , the aire itself looks lovely , but around the casette emptying area and grey drain there is human waste and toilet paper. Now reported to municipality who arrived to inspect. Disgraceful behaviour and an insult to the community who have welcomed motorhomers"
402560,2676086,5,LAXIENA,17/04/2023,"Great and calm night. Without a doubt, a very good area to rest if you are traveling on the A-8. Highly recommended."
402560,2657629,4,juankygh,10/04/2023,area very well located next to the Renfe station... area with grass and 15 minutes from downtown.
402560,2653603,5,Valencia1326,09/04/2023,"Good area 10 minutes walk from Luarca. There are restaurants, bars, bakeries... Water intake and discharge. Quiet at night, despite the fact that it is between a road and a train track, we slept wonderfully. The only thing I didn't like about everything is putting 3 barbecues 2 meters from where you park, there may be occasional smoke problems or disrespectful people. A 10 for Luarca. We will be back."
402560,2652812,5,AndreaMoncho,09/04/2023,Rest area well equipped. Wide. and shortly after the center. You have to make barbecues and tables. 100% recommended
402560,2647136,5,furinau,07/04/2023,Beautiful place. Amazing views and very peaceful. Thank you Luarka.
402560,2645827,4,LeopoldoFernandez,07/04/2023,"Motorhome area with water loading and unloading service, flat, good views of the city of Luarca, tables, quiet, about 10 minutes from the city center. Recommended."
402560,2645456,4,Burgaillo,07/04/2023,"Quiet, in the upper area, too much partying the other day so the usual t0nt0s slept badly..."
402560,2644141,4,trillonyotero,06/04/2023,very good area near the town and very very quiet
402560,2643598,4,losrobles,06/04/2023,"The site is new and clean, there are barbecues but it is true that responsible use should be made at times because there are people who use it as a bottle."
402560,2643048,4,Kasku51,06/04/2023,"The area itself is fine, but as the local police do not control its good use, it will soon be a bad option. Last night a barbecue of some young people from the town until 1 in the morning, with shouts and laughter, of course with their tourism within the area, that walking 50 meters must be very difficult for them. The new and clean service area."
402582,3198578,1,paskhy,22/08/2023,"This is not an area or a parking lot. It is only an esplanade where the fairs or the weekly market are supposedly installed. There is no telltale sign. There are no services of any kind either, just a few toilets that are closed. It is also located in the highest part of the town and difficult to access. The only positive thing has been the tranquility and silence when sleeping."
402582,2668085,3,elias10scambil,13/04/2023,super parking it is not necessary electricity there is drain gray water not found black water we can fill up with water thank you anyway to the municipality
402593,2777512,3,rafagonzalo,23/05/2023,"Quiet area, with 5 seats with inclination that can be solved with chocks. Unloading of gray and black and loading of potable. 8 light points that still don't work. Many thanks to the City Council for thinking of us"

402629,2969583,3,PauQuiros,15/07/2023,"Parking without any service. 15 min walk from the center all uphill. €12 24 hours overnight. you pay in machines with card or coins, it does not accept bills."
402629,2939616,1,MelanieSuarez,09/07/2023,"€12 for an open field full of mosquitoes, they only get fewer and fewer people to go to suances... a pity... not recommended"
402629,2915548,1,luisjorde,02/07/2023,"It is a municipal meadow without any type of service and quite neglected, and the motorhome area has lost the hand of God at the bottom of everything. €6 for the day or €12 with overnight. I would see it as acceptable if they allowed motorhomes to park on the street like cars. As would be appropriate. unfortunate and troglodyte measure."
402629,2860972,2,Alvirou,16/06/2023,"It is a municipal car park, which allows you to spend the night, paying €12. Very expensive because it doesn't even have services: there are no showers, no bathrooms, no place to empty or fill water. Leveled depending on which area. There are trash cans at the entrance"
402629,2858662,1,LeopoldoFernandez,16/06/2023,"Unpaved place without any kind of services. Of course, machines to charge 10 euros for spending the night. Put in contact with the responsible councilwoman, she tells us that due to the changes in government they have not been able to make the planned area (but the machines to collect if they have been able to)."
402629,2854277,3,Mtgiver24,14/06/2023,The site is quiet and spacious but..... €5 to park during the day and €10 to spend the night... without any type of service for caravans or toilets.
402629,2794124,4,Patxo22,28/05/2023,"Very quiet parking to spend the night. We had already slept when a boy from the Ayto charged. Now you pay by machine. Positive: quiet, a step away from the beach and greenway and many hotel options. Negative: ACs charge €10/24 hours without offering any service such as water, drainage, etc. Keep in mind that it is forbidden to park ACs in the entire municipality of Suances except in this car park."
402629,2711010,5,maitelrvl,30/04/2023,"At this time, a great place to sleep with restaurants and a nearby beach."
402653,3194181,5,Nuribu,21/08/2023,"Very quiet place and next to the beginning of the bridge route, perfect if you want to do it in the morning. There are uneven places and places with straight ground and there is no problem spending the night, the civil guard passed by in the morning and didn't tell us anything"
402653,2735405,5,Pema26,08/05/2023,"We have spent the night here, and it is a very quiet and very cool place, we liked the place very much, in the morning it is true that it begins to fill up with cars that are going to do the route of the hanging bridges."
402654,3082095,5,aguere,05/08/2023,"Very level parking, with nearby garbage containers, different supermarkets and 5 minutes from the metro. I spent a very quiet night. There were several vans and Motorhomes. (Weekend)"
402654,2645971,4,pacazzo,07/04/2023,"Don't worry. We spent the night without a problem, perhaps the only drawback is that there is still a little noise from cars on the road"
402654,2635180,4,Martapampin,02/04/2023,"The parking lot is very good, level spaces and quiet. In the morning, the police passed by and didn't say anything, so it must be allowed. the bad thing is that in the background you could hear the skidding and engine noises of the idiots who are dedicated to drinking and rallying in the decathlon parking lot that is just above"
402658,2919299,5,JaviEva,03/07/2023,"Ideal for spending the night after the night show at Puy de Fou (15 min away). Wide, and seats with space behind to put the overhang. Quiet, with a Covirán, a local prepared food, and a bar 2 min. As if that were not enough, a self-service gas station at the entrance to the town (Carburantes Argés, not the Repsol one) with very cheap diesel. Eye! on Wednesdays you cannot park (market)."
402659,3121235,4,famdamgo,11/08/2023,Parking somewhat uneven but very quiet perfect for visiting beaches and town
402659,3107961,4,davidbaz,09/08/2023,A quiet location with room. Not very clean but we were quiet around Faro
402659,2992561,4,FenjaB,20/07/2023,"Good place for one night. No services but beautiful sunrise among the trees and only 10 minutes walk to the airport. If you want to stand in the shade, you can drive to the ""off road"" area next to the road. There were other vans there too. quite littered."
402659,2984419,4,LagoRicc,18/07/2023,"good place to spend the night, all quiet. there is a raised clearing with trees under which you can park nearby where many campers and vans park (us included). there are no services and it is not very clean in the raised area"

402659,2702430,4,RonnOps,28/04/2023,we spent a quiet night without worries. given the heat we slept with the windows open there is always a slight noise from the nearby town but that did not prevent us from having a good night. no disruptor. no font.
402659,2670164,4,Yliana,14/04/2023,"Good place to spend the night for several days. Very quiet and with a lot of green field to walk. There are no services, but the place is ideal."
402659,2663950,4,VincentKern,12/04/2023,Lots of space and quiet surroundings. Little noise despite the very close airport (15 minutes walk). The only downside: very many mosquitoes at sunset!
402679,3072181,1,CharoT,03/08/2023,"Is closed. We went on August 3, 2023. June to the river."
402679,2722587,4,unomas,04/05/2023,"If you have a motorhome, currently you don't have many places, since the trees have very low branches. In any case, the night has been very quiet"

402686,2637525,5,93KEN,03/04/2023,very nice place lovely Park with exercise machines very close to bars restaurants and small bakery five minutes walk to the beach on main road but very quiet stayed a few nights no problems very safe
402687,3067332,5,jaybohnz,03/08/2023,"Best place ever. But ONLY with 4x4 do NOT try to go there with a non 4 wheels drive. You’ll able to go down, but you’ll not be able to go up. There is an awfully steep passage"
402695,2824075,4,AlexEberhard,05/06/2023,"We washed and dried our laundry there. 60 degrees for 30 minutes costs 6 €, the dryer for 5 minutes 1 euro. Unfortunately the laundry was very dirty and didn't look really well maintained. But at least our things were clean."
402709,3113373,4,MiMiCat123,10/08/2023,it us a nice place but it is very loud the whole time.
402709,2890106,2,Park4nightPortugal2k23,25/06/2023,"The place may seem attractive because of its small beach overlooking the river with a restaurant and a picnic area. But, toilets closed, the next day they were open but we were denied access, telling us to go to the restaurant. Outdoor showers meme we were knowingly asked not to use when they were working. I do not recommend this place. A lot of noise"
402709,2755208,5,icarvalhosa,16/05/2023,"Beautiful place to spend a few days. Peaceful overnight stay, quiet river beach with the possibility of diving and walks on the sand. Pleasant and well-maintained picnic area with plenty of shade and green spaces. Bathroom closed but good outdoor showers working. Very nice local trade and playground approved by my son. We will certainly return."
402709,2739088,5,victor76banshee,10/05/2023,"The place is very good, but you have to be careful with the people who collect barnacles, because they are controlling you, and there is a risk of being robbed."
402709,2676872,5,Anaettony,17/04/2023,"Nice pleasant place, view of the whole bay. When you wake up this morning, view of the pink flamingos. Quiet night. Picnic table, garbage cans, easy access (even HGV), large place to park."
402709,2635636,5,eaDesiderio,02/04/2023,"A little paradise by the water! Peaceful and friendly. It does not have eviction services, but the picnic park and all the surroundings are attractive for their beauty and care. It has several restaurants and cafes. A caravanist-friendly village. I recommend!"
402723,3008320,4,VanessaFranck,23/07/2023,we stayed there to have a picnic and sleep. drinking water and very beautiful view.

402770,3162897,4,Petitcorps,16/08/2023,"Plenty of room, flat on a nice spot although a bit grubby. It is also a spot known by the locals so it can get quite crowded. Swimming okay"

402777,2841309,5,yellow_vw,11/06/2023,Parked twice during the day to visit the town. Close to the coast and center. There was always a lot of space which might not be the case in July and August.
402783,2709249,4,camavz,30/04/2023,Location and quiet in a residential street. We spent one night there with our van. Very close to the historic center. Place very sought after in this street so you have to have a little luck.
402785,2784418,1,lorenitalory,25/05/2023,"A strange place, public land, but it is advisable to talk to a local of those who are campers, guard dogs in motorhomes that do not inspire much confidence, after seeing the place I decided not to stay there"
402820,3077927,3,Scudo_Home,04/08/2023,"Good spot to stay one night. Well isn't a good spot but is probably one of the best you can find in Lisbon.
Shade and near public transportation."
402850,3293162,5,InaDuda,13/09/2023,Parking on the street behind an apartment complex. Very centrally located beach (Baby beach) in 1 minute walk and also the bar bodegita. But it's very quiet here at night. You can also reach the Spar supermarket directly over a small hill. perfect location to visit Valle Gran Rey
402878,3008679,5,bleiberxx,23/07/2023,next to the highway to make a stop. perfect

402892,3270336,3,AnaOchoa,07/09/2023,"Street with cars on both sides and the train station right next door, so it is a quite noisy place. If you're just looking to spend the night, there's the GNR barracks on the corner and it seems safe. The area is paid from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. and the machine only accepts coins."
402892,3138624,1,fronsklis,13/08/2023,"Parking in Sintra is crazy. There are no places to park, very narrow and unsafe streets, dangers from tree branches, parking spaces with low gauges, etc... Better to go by train from Lisbon than with the AC."

402896,3023361,5,ruedasypatas,26/07/2023,"We have spent the night here super comfortable with another van. The bar closed and no one was left. A wonderful place to visit the 3 viewpoints, one of them the famous rotating hands. With AC or a van, you will not be able to go up, the road is narrow and in very bad condition, it is a 12-15 minute walk from the parking lot"
402905,3284322,5,DecretamosFeria,11/09/2023,"A perfect AC area: clean, with many parking spaces (some of them shaded) in a pleasant environment and close to the town. Many thanks to the city council."

402905,3176696,5,Raul2585,18/08/2023,"We did not stay because the fair was next door and we did not want noise, but it is a huge area, well planned with water and electricity service, something that many towns and cities cannot say. Close to the center and not far from the shopping area. Surely a highly recommended area. It's nice that there are municipalities that do these things so well"
402905,3137734,5,dasi67,13/08/2023,"Hello, I've been here since yesterday and you can enter, access is from the other side of the fair. Site 10 when the fair is not there due to noise, thanks to the municipality."

402905,3133453,5,Sergicamper89,13/08/2023,The place is very good to spend the night. It is big and has electrical connection. There are more caravans and fires. The downside is that it coincided with the town festivals and is attached to the fair and concerts. Until 5 in the morning quite noisy.
402905,3124073,5,OohhCake,11/08/2023,"Good location, good facilities, even better its free! there are caravans etc at the moment but they aren't a bother to anyone. lots of other motorhomes here and pretty sure the caravans are a part of the fair event here and will be moving on soon. Great area by Amposta!"
402905,3106596,1,Juanmillas,09/08/2023,"The idea is great, but I'm here right now, several caravans have been set up in a gypsy camp, cutting off access to the toilet drain, and the taps don't work, looking at it, connections have been made to each caravan from the hose, I understand that's why there is no water coming to the faucets. A pity that the ayto. Allow this."
402905,3083667,5,SergioConnor,05/08/2023,"Without a doubt, the best in the entire area, it's as huge as a soccer field and everything is free, what a great relief to be able to put on the air conditioning... a park to take out the dog or children attached to the area and it's fenced gives security, thanks Amposta!"
402905,3083291,5,eldelacajita,05/08/2023,"Huge area, with all free services. It is in a park and you have everything close by, laundromats, supermarkets...

It has all the services for free (grey and black water, electricity and water). The local police come by very often, which gives a lot of security. Very quiet place and absolutely recommended. Many thanks to the Amposta City Council for having this space!"
402905,2976564,5,MarcoCandioli,17/07/2023,"Excellent free parking with basic services c/s and electricity, perfect for visiting the Ebro delta, thanks to the municipality for the excellent initiative."
402905,2962708,5,ludmila75,14/07/2023,Perfect ! very easy access even with a large vehicle. easy emptying and water column right next to it. All free. thank you to the municipality for thinking of us. a few trees in the back of the parking lot to have a little shade.
402905,2956239,4,victormoreira,12/07/2023,amazing to see a spot with free services even electricity!!! frankly top well maintained land very very rare !!
402905,2955363,4,bessymaxemily,12/07/2023,Great new park up. Went to the pool which was 4€10 per adult which was a massive relief in the heat. Location seemed lovely but we just stopped for the night so didn’t explore. We only found grey and clean water. And electric available in most spots. Bins on road. Only downside is water is run above ground which isn’t safe for drinking and water hot. Thank you for providing free places for us
402905,2954323,5,RvB3nS,12/07/2023,"10/10. Well-kept free site in Amposta. Plenty of parking spaces, free electricity and free water drainage. It also has water, although it does not indicate if it is drinkable. Next to the center of the town. Many thanks to the Town Hall Like many, after sleeping here we have come to see the town and eat in one of its restaurants. Surely we would not have done it if it hadn't been for the AC area, so a hit"
402905,2935040,5,silviagalan,07/07/2023,"At the moment everything is very clean, we need to find the water. Very good area, very spacious and all free. Take an example gentlemen from other towns A 10 for amposta. We can only say wonderful area"
402905,2931933,5,marpaufel,07/07/2023,"Thank you Amposta Town Hall. Magnificent area. Let's make good use of it. Here they know that we are a type of tourism that is beneficial for local businesses, not like many municipalities that are due to the campsites and veto us. There they. Where they hinder us, we simply do not go. Excellent town of Amposta, thank you very much for your welcome."
402905,2924182,5,Stayan,04/07/2023,"We have loved this area! It is big, it is clean and it has all the free services, including electricity. In addition, there is a pipican for dogs right next door and a nice park with a play area for children. There is also a supermarket nearby and you can walk to the center of Amposta!"
402905,2921128,5,Autocaraveando,04/07/2023,"Great site, with all the free services and a nearby park. Ideal for children. The only thing missing is a little more shade. All perfect!!"
402905,2916145,4,Jeanjacquesmartine,02/07/2023,super everything and free and very clean BRAVO games for children. very flat land
402905,2908674,4,staffie88100,30/06/2023,"Quiet night, not a lot of places in the shade but we can't complain, everything is free. Playground nearby for children,"
402905,2878476,5,homersilka,21/06/2023,"It's great, a large playground next door, the Ebro river also next door. central and close to the a7 motorway exit"
402905,2872315,5,pold89,19/06/2023,"Stayed one night. Found everything very pleasant. Environment clean park with playground very nice. Within a 5-10 minute walk there are restaurants and a China store for light camping supplies. The place is not yet fully built but already usable. Electricity, water, sewage worked. Everything is still clean and everyone should try to keep it that way. A big thank you to the city"
402905,2852602,5,PacoAgea,14/06/2023,"Congratulations, Amposta for this spectacular area (although some things need to be finished) and also for that great park next door. Thank you"

402905,2825659,5,RomayCuenca,06/06/2023,"Spectacular area, it is in progress but gray and black water can now be emptied, only electricity is missing. To say that a huge storm fell on us at night and there was not a puddle in the morning. Next to a park and the town is accessed from the park itself, better impossible. Of course, be careful with the black fly and mosquitoes."
402905,2819670,4,SannevdB,04/06/2023,I’ve been here on a Saturday. I am a light sleeper and slept like a baby. There where no problems at all. I don’t understand all the complaining about no electricity or water. This is a free place to spend the night. If you want services go pay for a spot somewhere else. This is a great place to stay if you go to or come back from visiting the delta. The neighborhood has not much to offer.
402905,2819370,2,Charlie0604,04/06/2023,"No electricity! Just big gravel pitch. Hopefully no stone throwers. Environment nice for walking. Lots of mosquitoes! A plague, you have them in the mobile home. 11 p.m. still screaming children. Dogs barking in the neighborhood at night. Firecrackers go off, poor bastards. Loud music from young people nearby. The place is bad if you want to sleep! I WAS HERE FRIDAY! There are good free spots too!"
402905,2809400,4,Grobi22,01/06/2023,Relaxed place with free services. For families I can highly recommend the Sweet Room café. (1km west. Can be found via Google) It's a kind of indoor playground and café at the same time.
402905,2806107,5,delavegaRT,31/05/2023,hello to all very quiet and relaxing place with free electricity but nothing worked for us it was not a problem because we are autonomous. laundromat 700 m from the nice town center I recommend there is the market on Tuesdays...
402905,2804536,5,Katteke,31/05/2023,"Next to a small park with a playground. There was just a Moto meeting going on with the necessary live music once 00h in the evening and everything was quiet, outside the usual crowd going on. Only it was a weird system of black water (orange barrel), a few places with shadow."
402905,2798534,4,CynthiaGibling,29/05/2023,"we returned to this great aire today. sadly, all the power is off. I don't know if it is a fault or has been turned off. we shall stay anyway."
402905,2777758,4,MAXREX,23/05/2023,"Little by little it is perfected, time by time. Perfect motorhome area. Greetings AMPOSTA and to its organizer CHE-CA. Great market fair. ARBECA - The WHITE BORGES"
402905,2776803,5,locoXNoruega,22/05/2023,"A newly created area with all free services. a park with a small lake, 15 minutes from downtown, the entire perimeter fenced, a 10 for its Town Hall and the promoter of this area, JM Checa."
402905,2774876,4,mikyII,22/05/2023,"Great, I give it 4 stars because the emptying of the black ones was not entirely pleasant, there are also electrical connection terminals missing"
402905,2774745,4,Mamoji,22/05/2023,"Perfect location, flat, guarded by the local police and close to many shops. See you soon Check that I will return without a doubt."
402905,2768416,5,Juanky59,20/05/2023,"Good area, with free current in some squares, filled with drinking water, emptying of gray and black water, provisional. Very spacious and quiet area, next to a large park. A town with a lot of history, worth visiting to enjoy its gastronomy and thank you for your welcome. Thanks to Juan M. Checa for his great work and ""awakening"" the will of the City Council in its construction."
402905,2753778,5,thokata,16/05/2023,"Last night was very calm and pleasant. The police control the square and the adjoining playground, I've seen it several times, so the problem of the stone throwers is being taken care of. Otherwise, as everyone else has mentioned, everything is free of charge, even electricity."
402905,2751773,1,r.kappauf,15/05/2023,Caution! we were thrown with stones A van got a considerable body damage The police are powerless This place is not recommended
402905,2750123,5,2LoseFeet,14/05/2023,"Brilliant place to stay.
Has everything including electric.
Clean and functional.
Lots of spaces.
Well done to the local people and council."
402905,2748759,5,jesusmc,14/05/2023,"Very calm and silence to sleep. All free, the municipal ones pass daily"
402905,2747608,4,MamouRoux,14/05/2023,Alright. Beautiful walks in the rice fields.
402905,2747281,1,tomsmitty,13/05/2023,"Is a nice place all free. But watch out, here they throw stones. When 6 teenagers run across the square every day. And the police don't do anything despite the description, they don't care or they are powerless"
402905,2745153,4,cdulbecco,13/05/2023,"for now everything free including electricity. dirt floor with a lot of dust if there is wind. good zone. seems safe. there is someone alive who stays a long time. Let's hope that when it's finished, the town hall will control more"
402905,2741688,5,padraigl,11/05/2023,Lovely Aire. Parked under trees out of the hot sun.
402905,2741626,5,CrivelliMaryse,11/05/2023,excellent free water and electricity shops nearby lots of things to visit see tourist office thank you to the town and their inhabitants
402905,2738969,5,momoja,10/05/2023,Very clean place being installed. for the moment free water and electricity...for the moment. Tourist office nearby and competent staff..nothing to complain about after 4 days of stay..I will come back.
402905,2738072,4,Carlosvictor,10/05/2023,"Congratulations to the town hall for this area, I see that it is new and a little lacking, for example where everyone criticizes throwing the pot, but it is not bad, the only thing to differentiate is the faucets for washing the pot to load water, some put their spouts in the faucet, On the other hand, electricity is free and in winter they will have to control it because I have seen in other areas that they connect electric stoves."
402905,2734901,4,GandT,08/05/2023,"Great new Aire with easy access, full aire facilities (free) & electricity. Water was warm.
Adjacent to a clean recreational ground. A walk round town & the river was ok but sad to see so much dog poo along the walkways. Nearest laundry is clean, 9 machines & 6 or 7 dryers. Biggest disappointment seeing cathago man beat his dog, he allowed his dog on long lead to stray on busy road, shame on you!"
402905,2734865,4,lukasdeurdiale,08/05/2023,quiet and well done.
402905,2726849,4,AnneLo4j,06/05/2023,"Large, flat and clean parking lot. Close to the city center. Only downside, the black water drainage system is impractical."
402905,2722938,5,MiNomadi,04/05/2023,Perfect place - we love it here
402905,2719342,4,CalViudo,03/05/2023,"We were there on the night of 04/22/2023. New and very large area with some plugs. Well located and quite silent, completely flat and quite delimited. The services are correct, except for the emptying of the potty, as already mentioned in other comments and it seems that it is on the way to a solution. Thanks to the city council."
402905,2713892,5,nuketown,01/05/2023,"Very spacious, some trees to provide shade, others in full growth... the area has just started! perhaps the worst thing is the emptying of the potti that is in a common pond for all. Places like this are appreciated!"
402905,2710573,5,josepajosepa,30/04/2023,"a perfect place, with water, light, flat to sleep. Thank you for carrying out projects of this level."
402905,2710527,5,vbc,30/04/2023,Thank you for this very nice area. We hope that among all its users we make good use of it.
402905,2709840,4,RC1003,30/04/2023,"Flat site, close to the center and with all services... and free. I didn't like the black emptied system...in a warehouse where you can see all the other people's waste...a bit unpleasant. And the last straw... two motorhomes, door to door and a third making the ""u""... parked in the middle of the road to meet in the playpen that the other two had set up."
402905,2704275,5,Felice66,28/04/2023,"Spent a very quiet night, gladly again, everything for free, thanks to the community."
402905,2700765,4,rosejipounet,27/04/2023,very good water and drainage and in addition there is free electricity. amazing ! you can visit the nearby town.
402905,2698601,4,Jurek55,26/04/2023,Very good place with everything you need including free electricity. Star deduction for non-optimal V+E. Big thanks to the community.
402905,2697371,4,morganech,26/04/2023,"Recent and free parking area. Some electrical terminals exist but they are taken by other vehicles. Next to a park, playground. Work is underway next door with prefabricated construction sites. For one night it's fine."
402905,2696027,5,Sin.deentrega,25/04/2023,"perfect motorhome area. Loading and unloading of water and electricity. Very quiet, we have not had any problems. Very quiet town, area of bars and restaurants, central market, walk along the banks of the Ebro. Many thanks to the town hall"
402905,2695342,5,vevedol35,25/04/2023,Very nice new area. Complicated to have a catch because there are many motorhomes.
402905,2693606,3,DarkCatLyon,24/04/2023,"For our taste, too much in the city, people walk around continuously, you don't have nice views."
402905,2687649,5,hikingviking13,22/04/2023,Just used the service but the area is really nice. Water disposal and fill is right at the entrance on the left side.
402905,2686975,4,karinchristian,22/04/2023,"very generously laid out. Still under construction. Everything was very clean, including the park all around. The police are constantly patrolling and have informed me that there have already been 2 cases of campers being broken into during the day, so be careful."
402905,2686692,5,Ellaal,21/04/2023,excellent ! and this beautiful park next door!
402905,2685680,5,pabibadel,21/04/2023,"Nothing to say about this place! We were quiet, under a tree, windshield facing north to avoid overexposure to the sun. Free electricity (not sustainable in the long term I think) and all services on site. Nice municipal park including for children and dogs. Small pleasant town with many restaurants and shops. Magnificent region (the Delta)."
402905,2682114,4,eurotrotterV8,19/04/2023,"Came here through the tourist office. All amenities. About 20 outlets (free power!), at least as many without. nice and flat, on paved terrain. This will be a hit. Playground, dog park, the beautiful city on the Rio Ebro and on the edge of the delta. working points: water supply runs over the ground. discharge black water into container. Gracias Amposta!"
402905,2679889,5,Montanerosviaje,18/04/2023,Spacious area with large level squares and free light. If you go with children there is a large playground next to the area and a pond with ducks. If you are with dogs there is a fenced dog park right next door. Excellent
402905,2678942,5,mapa,18/04/2023,Very good area I join the previous comments a 10 for the town hall
402905,2677817,5,lalocostes,17/04/2023,"Beautiful area that meets very good conditions although it is still in the process of adaptation. It has free electricity, emptying of gray and black water, very spacious, very quiet, and a large playground next door. For all this we must thank Mr. Checa for the effort made to get this beautiful area."
402905,2671280,5,mlolo,15/04/2023,"Well mounted and leveled, with services. Very spacious. It seems that they will make it even wider."

402905,2667173,5,Matt132,13/04/2023,"Water, garbage and electricity! Many new terminals were installed this morning (at least 20 possible connections)"
402905,2666986,5,goldinesatack,13/04/2023,"A great area, thanks to the city of Amposta. free electricity and lots of space next to a park with a dog pit. There is shaded area but no electricity. I do not recommend it to make potty or fill water."
402905,2660559,3,Dirck,11/04/2023,"Clean, lots of space. Close to town. Free so no complaints."
402905,2654138,4,kolokasa,09/04/2023,"New area that, as you can see, is not yet finished. It has a few points of light in the side squares. The ones in the middle are ready to insert the electrical panel. The only negative point that I hope is solved is the emptying of the pot, which you have to lift to empty it into a chemical waste container. The water points would have to be separated for hygiene. The water pipe would have to go underground."
402905,2653408,4,Kram907,09/04/2023,"Large gravel area, with all free services and close to the center. Very quiet night."
402905,2651964,5,joanvilase,08/04/2023,"We opened it, many thanks to the town hall, a beautiful space, totally recommended"

402905,2646822,4,xabatiko,07/04/2023,good level area with ample spaces. It has free electrical outlets in some plots. The environment of the area is very beautiful and well cared for. It has a great park for children. good option to spend a night
402905,2643925,2,HubertusAlbers,06/04/2023,"Nice big parking space on the outskirts. Supply is still possible, but disposal is still provisional. unfortunately you have to tip your cassette into a large container that is already well filled with the legacies of other campers (photo). You have to unscrew the big cover. Pretty disgusting. I'm always glad that I haven't had a chemical toilet for a long time."
402905,2639352,5,Che-ca,04/04/2023,An area that is starting now with a lot of desire and willingness to welcome visitors who want to know the population and the delta area.
402905,2639029,2,NellekedeR,04/04/2023,"New camper place. Fine. But still some improvements. Flush tap and clean water tap very close to each other and not labeled. Unhygienic. The black water supply hose, for both taps, runs dozens of meters above ground: And the water is at least 40 degrees warm. Ideal for legionella. After several minutes of rinsing, the water remained warm."
402915,3289796,5,xMagali,12/09/2023,"We spent one night there and we're the only ones there. It was a dream! Beautiful view over the sea. The outdoor shower was an amazing experience, everything was clean and nicely kept."
402915,3268422,5,Tacococker,07/09/2023,"Wonderful place! Wild camping without stress about possible fines and with a warm outdoor shower for a reasonable price, what more could one want! Freek puts his heart and soul into this project and you notice that in every detail"

402915,3264479,5,fritsvanlatum,06/09/2023,A fantastic place and very nice people. We stayed here for 6 nights in our tent. Simple and ecologically responsible facilities.
402915,3257077,2,lar.bu,04/09/2023,"The location is beautiful, but 20€ for 1 night/1 person is a little overpriced for a spot without any privacy, no shade, compost toilet and no electricity. Sorry to say because I felt the space is kept well and they were friendly."
402915,3222338,5,arturundkim,26/08/2023,"We came for three nights, which turned into three weeks. It was a wonderful time with Freek and all the other people we got to know here. It is a place in nature where you can switch off and relax. To cool off there is a really cool (proper) outdoor shower and a mini pool with sea views. There is a very warm atmosphere. We will be back!"
402915,3114990,5,emiliesct,10/08/2023,"After being pleasantly welcomed we were able to park our van between the orange trees. An outdoor shower (hot or cold), dry toilets, laundry facilities and a sink for washing up are available. I recommend, it was a perfect night in a heavenly setting! (You must send a msg to Outbase explorers before to check availability)"

402915,3090189,4,LukasSchlicker,06/08/2023,"We received a friendly welcome. The place is nice, is still under construction, some things still seem a bit unorganized. The gate can only be opened by the owner using a cell phone signal. The owners are not always there. Pitch allocation was slightly chaotic (double occupancy). The location of the toilet, shower, sink could be better (connected and at a certain distance from pitches)."
402915,3035300,5,Cambat,28/07/2023,"A very nice place, a quiet little break with showers, sinks, toilets. The pitches are quite isolated and some are shaded by trees. We recommend !"

we sleep super well below a nice tree and the accomodations where super nice.

You have everything you need: Good hosts that show you around and even join you for good conversations and a beer (if you are up to), only a few and private camp spots, an outdoor shower and toilet and an amazing shared chill/lounge and dinner area free to use. We would come back at any time! Thanks Freek for creating this unique place!"

402915,2883013,5,TonyIberler,23/06/2023,"Freek built a true oasis for campers here. We pitched our tent underneath a huge almond tree, which provided shade and a comfortable ground to sleep on. We could pick fresh oranges from the trees and buy fresh plums as well. The facilities were tidy and biodegradable soap was provided."
402915,2854403,5,YviT,14/06/2023,"A dream! Overnight between orange and olive trees including snacking. Hot outdoor shower under almond trees, organic toilet, outdoor sink, everything is new and created with a lot of love. We had a lot of space and privacy. Arrival possible until 6.30 p.m., simple clarification via WhatsApp with Silke possible. We had a quiet night, 15 minutes by car on the beach. Many thanks for this great place!"
402915,2795150,5,ChristinMe,28/05/2023,Perfect place to stop for a night. You get to pluck your own oranges as well! Everyone who is part of this project is super nice and helpful!

402915,2749320,5,katandgoretti,14/05/2023,"As others all noted, idyllic camping between olive and fig trees on the edge of an orange orchard. The smell of fennel growing everywhere. Amazing views of the Algarve from the Cerro de Cabeça trail which starts close by. Easy drive to quaint town of Casela Velha, where we explored and walked on the beach for hours. Would 100% come back here!"
402915,2743546,5,RasselbandeBPS,12/05/2023,"A really beautiful place in the middle of nature, between orange trees and olive groves. The choice of seat is free, you can simply stand where you feel comfortable. If you want, also completely secluded with a lot of distance. There is a great natural shower under a big tree. Just a great feeling! The owner is very nice and I felt right at home! Highly recommended if you are looking for peace and nature."
402915,2740255,5,Beinert,10/05/2023,"Very nice, idyllic pitches! Very good communication via WhatsApp. Friendly welcome by Freek. Highly Recommended."
402915,2730280,5,doreenams,07/05/2023,"What a nice place and a warm welcome from Freek. Reading a book in the hammock in the evening and rolling out my yoga mat between the olive and orange trees in the morning, wonderful! Close to the coast and the beautiful town of Tavira. I will definitely come back, if only for the outdoor shower under the almond tree!"
402915,2702205,5,knautzibautzi,28/04/2023,Beautiful pitch with a nice welcome! You immediately feel welcome...
402915,2692241,5,Mimarc,23/04/2023,"Beautiful place to relax and walk. We were allowed to choose a spot next to the orange trees. The vision really appealed to us with an outdoor shower and eco-friendly toilet. Freek gave us a tour and we also saw the beautiful b&b rooms. Unfortunately we had to continue due to a defect in the camper. Freek had many great tips, and also knew a garage. Great stay!"
402915,2690154,5,Kimanne,23/04/2023,"A real haven of peace where we were welcomed as friends with our little family. Back to basics: picking oranges to squeeze them for breakfast, letting ourselves be rocked in the shade of the trees on a hammock with a sea view, showering (O hot) under a beautiful almond tree, we spent three rejuvenating days. A big thank you to Freek and his companion for these beautiful moments of sharing."
402915,2687861,5,charlysroad,22/04/2023,This place is amazing. A lovely host who really knows how to create a nice atmosphere! The outdoor shower is perfectly warm and nice. If you want a little more comfort…This place has also  beautiful rooms to rent! We will come back!
402915,2657292,5,TimT4,10/04/2023,Frank is a super host. Wonderful places between the orchard with beautiful views and the sea in the distance. Recommended!
402915,2637950,5,TysoLena,03/04/2023,Waking up between the orange trees in a beautiful quiet location. A lovely hot outdoor shower as an added bonus. During our stay we were kindly received and shown around the huge country by Freek and his team from Outbase. Highly recommended to park your camper and enjoy the beautiful surroundings!
402941,3280662,4,Guri,10/09/2023,"PR, large parking next to Mercadona but access is not from here but from the side of the avenue. Good location to visit Porto with metro, 20m. Buy one-person transport card and recharge -3 zones-, validate before getting on the metro. We slept 2 quiet nights, lots of AC and campers. There are no services. The area is very close"
402941,3243993,5,ikersagarduy,31/08/2023,"Perfect place to visit Porto, parking with many ACs, which gives confidence, the metro 100 meters away that leaves you in the center in 20 minutes, we stayed 2 nights and without any problem, at night a very quiet area."
402941,3222107,5,CRT04,26/08/2023,Everything very good very calm
402941,3220936,5,altuna03,26/08/2023,Very quiet and recommended place.
402941,3212388,5,WB222,24/08/2023,"We stayed 3 nights (end of August) Advantage that the tram starts directly in front of the parking lot. In terms of volume, it was very quiet. The trash cans were also emptied every day. We were never alone and that made us feel very safe. Even if there is no fresh water and no waste water place, still 5 stars."
402941,3203813,3,carlosvelascob,23/08/2023,"Good parking and in front of the tram, we did not spend the night but it is recommended and according to other neighbors better than the official parking with services next door because apparently there is a complicated person who lives there"
402941,3184561,5,marinayfer,20/08/2023,"We left the motorhome (large and new) in this parking lot. We arrived at night, and there were places. It is a very safe place. All in order. In uber you can reach the center in 15 minutes. This is one of the few places in the city that made us confident to leave our walking house outside of bottle places. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
402941,3181310,4,manu1483,19/08/2023,"Excellent parking about 10 km from the center of the port but reachable by metro which is opposite, there are also two supermarkets within walking distance"
402941,3179577,5,BrushieMuc,19/08/2023,"The place was great for sightseeing in Porto. It was pretty busy, but we managed to get a seat around lunchtime. The night was calm. It only got louder in the morning. A ride with Bolt from the center cost 9€. There is a genuinely good café a block away."
402941,3159381,3,Setysima,16/08/2023,"Dissuasive parking that is only safe due to the presence of many AC and Campers that do not enter the other one next door. It's noisy, kids drinking late at night, cars speeding up and passing through the parking lot. At night there is also a feeling that there are bad habits in the area, dealings... It is only comfortable because of the ease of the subway next door."
402941,3158778,4,boheme85,16/08/2023,Perfect parking for a night or two. Transport right next to visit Porto. Supermarket on foot.
402941,3142080,4,stepway64,14/08/2023,"Indeed, this car park is perfect. Large square, shops nearby, the metro just behind. I was surprised that everyone found this car park quiet because I did not sleep a night. Indeed, on the ground , there are grates in places under which there are (noisy!!) pumps that come on intermittently. Strangely, I hadn't heard them during the day. Avoid these locations!"
402941,3107526,5,MIrazoki,09/08/2023,"We chose this option based on the comments we read, and the truth is that it was very good, we spent 3 nights. Perfect place to visit Porto, the train is taken next door, and in 25 min. you are in the center The last day we went to empty and load the area next to it, it was crowded and very little space between motorhomes, so we think this option is better than the area."
402941,3068054,5,guau,03/08/2023,Large secure parking to visit the city next to the metro station. We found it a better option than the area. Next to the Mercadona. We spent 2 nights.
402941,3060962,5,maurowar,02/08/2023,"very large parking, I recommend arriving after 6pm. convenient for sleeping and visiting Porto. Metro at 50mt with 4 euro return to Porto every 15 minutes. Really convenient for visiting the city. I advise against entering Porto with a camper where it is easy to get stuck in some streets that suddenly become very narrow. Thank you"
402941,3054546,5,Txivero,31/07/2023,Perfect parking to see the city and spend the night. Flat and almost noiseless. Tram stop right next to it that leaves you in the center in 20 minutes.
402941,3038957,4,ciervalo,29/07/2023,Car park at the Fanceres metro stop. 30' by metro to the center of Porto. Mercadona a few meters away. We slept peacefully for 2 nights. Perfect to get to know Porto.
402941,3028024,5,moteroAC,27/07/2023,"It is a parking lot for people who use the Metro, we stayed 1 night with several AC/Camper... Maybe outside of summer it is more crowded by people who go to work... but now it was very good. Perfect to visit Porto. €1.70 To the center. You have to get a card, some guys who were leaving gave it to us..."
402941,3010667,4,Hectoribio,24/07/2023,"Compared to the motorhome area next door, this alternative is much better. Wider squares and less crowding. Also with the subway next door. Buy a metro ticket per person, the vouchers for 5 or 10 trips are not like in Madrid where you can use the trips you want and several people pass by. We traveled by subway with a dog and no problem. Porto left us in love."
402941,2994863,4,MSMaria,20/07/2023,"Public parking, very quiet. Bins that collect daily, Mercadona and MacroChino next door. Metro stop next door to go to Porto. Side area for loading and unloading. To put a hitch, there are days when kids go to make a bottle with the cars but they have not bothered us at all."
402941,2949213,4,mymy34,11/07/2023,"Large parking lot to spend the night. A little noisy because young people come to spend the evening there, but nothing too bad. The metro passes just opposite at €1.40 for a one-way ticket to visit Porto. We spent the whole day in Porto and no problem when we got back. The mercadona is right next door. Great for a free place."
402941,2917154,1,philou47,02/07/2023,"Having visited Porto from this car park, I confirm all the comments for the visit to the city. It's 10 p.m. and it's already a mess. Young people, with jobard music and smoking, have settled down next door. The quiet evening will not be, so we decide to leave. The most con is that I took tickets for 3 days of visit and that I don't want to come back here."
402941,2818784,5,Kartoffelsuppe,04/06/2023,Can only agree: Great place to spend a night and visit Porto. Metro stop directly opposite (the train runs every 15 minutes). Surprisingly quiet at night and much more pleasant than the parking space around the corner. Here you have enough space for yourself. no service
402941,2766910,5,Julez0803,20/05/2023,"Perfect for taking the train to Porto, just under 30 minutes. There are a few trees that provide shade. Area fairly quiet, didn't sleep there but we would have."

402941,2642205,5,ttbarros,05/04/2023,"Good place for overnight stay. We spent 2 nights. Very calm. It has no services, but the park close to this one has services, so you can quickly reach the other one to fill the water tank or empty gray water."
402941,2640073,5,heavy80,04/04/2023,"The place is great. Much quieter than the square one stop down. I have not seen supply and disposal here, but can be done at the other parking space. The other parking space is completely overcrowded and you are next to each other. So better go here."
402941,2639489,5,KMarvin,04/04/2023,"Pitch is perfect to see Porto. The metro is right in front of the parking lot, but you can't hear it loud. Stood there for 2 nights with other campers. Parking lot is bigger and not as crowded as the other one nearby. Felt safe."
402964,3274157,1,POLICIA_LOCAL,08/09/2023,"We inform you that the regulations in Sant Josep do not allow camping or spending the night outside of the authorized campsites. The claim is up to 750 euros, please respect local regulations."

402964,3058071,5,johannastreeb,01/08/2023,"Awesome view and sunset. One risk/challenge: there is a sign that now “camping, camper van or fire” is not allowed. I guess it’s new."
402964,2694155,5,bruno0586,24/04/2023,"beautiful and quiet place to stato with an amazing view on the cala comte beach. 
small dirty road, not for big campers or motorhomes. i ve ben there in low season and nobody disturbed us."
402995,3261721,1,Iratxo,05/09/2023,"Place with dirt and garbage lying on the floor, it is very noisy since it is next to the airport with planes constantly landing and taking off. There are some families living right there in some kind of wagons and we also saw rats. We will not return."
402995,3104031,5,kwochner,08/08/2023,"At the end of the street two long squares overlooking the harbour. The handful of planes a day don't bother me. On the contrary. We slept quietly. There was an ""extended family"" in the parking lot next door, which may put you off. Were noisy during the day but friendly and all quiet at night. The location is great, right next to the old town."
403031,2980496,3,arraiuda,18/07/2023,"We spent the night here since the next day we had a pass to the Aquapark. Noisy, continuous passage of cars because it is very close to the highway. No service or special sites for long vehicles (7m). We have slept with 3 other ACs. There is no sign of prohibited overnight so we have encouraged."
403052,3056661,3,Fordisme17,01/08/2023,lost in the wild we clicked on this motorhome area without verifying that it was private individuals. after 5kms in narrow paths lined with branches we arrive at the property which is in hyppie mode from the 60s with abandoned vehicles. we left and on the balance sheet the vehicle is all scratched on both sides. we could not see if the proposed photos correspond.

It was great to learn about the way they were implementing permaculture principles into their lives and land.

Would recommend!"

Thank you to this municipality that created this place."
403070,2933206,4,BeauLunaEdvantures,07/07/2023,"Great location for zoo and exploring, quiet with level marked spaces. Fresh water, grey and black water disposal. Unfortunately used as a car park for the swimming baths opposite and abused by the locals who dump their rubbish here despite there being skips for garbage and recycling within a few meters. Still worth 4 stars if you don’t mind cleaning the area and waiting for a space first."
403070,2889598,5,rocio89,25/06/2023,"Good place to spend the night, you can hear the traffic of cars but there is no problem if you want to sleep late I recommend parking in the area where there is a small promenade, not where the fountain is, since the trees cover the sun a lot."
403070,2881714,4,Querzeltein,22/06/2023,The place was clean and there is a drinking water point and gray water disposal there. Garbage cans are also available.

On one side views of a quarry, on the other side beautiful views of cherry trees. There is a significant slope to the beginning of the routes and the river, but in 10 minutes you are there. There are options on the other side of the town, in the industrial estate, but to do the waterfalls route, it's not bad."

Please, take your garbage, do not empty the sewage because it goes into the river next to it, it occupies only one space, if the parking lot is very full, do not camp outside, if it does not fit due to height, do not break the branches of the trees , do not use the compost container. In short, respect because they are going to prohibit us."

403266,2644815,4,HernanOrdiales,06/04/2023,"We slept peacefully, very close to the centeo, free. The vans fit perfectly wide, since the medifa is standard for cars. Of course, being relatively central, there is some vehicle traffic."

403292,2932999,4,marielcaramel,07/07/2023,We had a very nice and quiet night. Definitely recommended for a weekend overnight stop. But not for more than that. Could get noisier during the week as it is a parking area for industry.
403292,2642449,2,anaman,05/04/2023,It is a very large car park with no services. The entrance from the road is paved and wide as it serves the nearby industrial estate. The views towards the coast are very good. Possibility of taking a walk along the coastal area. Quiet and lonely.
403295,3265988,4,LacaravaningAndre,06/09/2023,"We arrived at night on this street and parked without any problem, but we were unlucky because it was a party and we had a noisy night! We liked the place and found it quiet, although we only spent one night."
403295,3133780,5,juanjoseruiz,13/08/2023,"Perfect place to stop the night, very safe, it coincided that there was a party in the bullring and we had music for a while, the pond as they call it around here and the fishermen give a charm at dawn."

The second night a motorhome parked next to it, emptied the water and left...very bad, if we don't take care of the few places we have we will be left without any. Apart from this, next to a Mercadona and very close to the center."
403338,2848014,1,ManiTheVani,12/06/2023,"Stunning spot, but unfortunately had to give it a 1 star as we were asked by the police to move on at 7:30pm. He said we can park up for a little but cannot sleep there as it’s a national park."

(Van fitted out) we arrived at 11.15 a.m. on a Wednesday, we had just the last place! They prefer that the van call to be sure before coming! They keep the keys just in case!"
403387,2878317,4,isabelllaaa,21/06/2023,"Great parking lot to explore the city, close to the center. Great briefing, driveway approx. 2.70 m high. In some places you have to hand in the keys because there are emergency exits!"

403426,2812623,1,Metternich,02/06/2023,The place is useless. Full and apparently recently provided with parking bays only for cars. Totally overcrowded.
403438,2649969,4,Oskitar13,08/04/2023,Good for parking but we must be aware when we park in 50 spaces they cannot park 15 AC and not allow cars to park.

403452,3159170,5,galeginho,16/08/2023,"Pleasant stay in Camuñas. We arrived in the area, a public holiday, and the 220v connection was locked: we tried to call the town hall but since it was a public holiday, it was closed; After a walk through the town (last day of festivities, apparently) we asked civil protection, and with wonderful treatment, they moved Rome with Santiago so that they would come to open the lock on the light. That's nice. Un10"
403452,3087588,5,thepatou64,06/08/2023,this air is just fantastic thank you very much to the municipality for this little extra development which would be interesting to have the possibility of connecting to the 220volt network

403452,2769355,5,bikefire,20/05/2023,"Forget previous reviews because the area is perfect. It has 3 places, water change, pre-installed electricity at the expense of permits. Level, no noise, and the people here are super friendly and helping to see how they could help. The town hall has a 24-hour email to consult. Let's see... It's all free and at least you have to be grateful to these towns. Super good Camuñas."
403452,2701817,3,AlecButcher,27/04/2023,"Good idea nice and quiet but there is no electricity since it is closed with a padlock. There is only one Coviran in the town in a very narrow street with almost no signal door (we asked a town inhabitant). If there is sewage emptying, you have to use a tool from your box to remove the lid."

403533,2645861,5,ekkofrenchie,07/04/2023,We found it by chance. It is a very quiet residential area. We have been without shoes. No no overnight sign. Let's go on fire. There are paths with beautiful views of nature.
403557,2713862,5,camilo57,01/05/2023,"how good parking since it has a cement surface and is practically level. It is at the entrance of the town and next to a hermitage and the municipal swimming pool, it has a good view of the castle and it is next to the greenway and also has some shade. There is a tap near the entrance of the hermitage. We spent a very calm and cool night and were not bothered by the little traffic that existed at all."
403601,3139268,5,khris,13/08/2023,"perfect. Scale included for 50 cents. AC laundry, emptying of water and garbage. We have not stayed overnight. Just one snag. There are flies."
403601,2650587,5,JOJUSA,08/04/2023,it is a green spot with services 500 meters from the town center. it is next to the road but if you can sleep.
403601,2646395,5,PratReef,07/04/2023,"It is not an AC area in question but you can park and spend the night, it has clean and dirty water and WC services. Laundry and garbage collection point as well as Scale."
403609,3195041,1,pekecamp,21/08/2023,"We have arrived and we have asked if we could spend the night, it was just a city council worker, he told us it is prohibited and that there are some signs we have not been there for even an hour, it is a pity to have spent money in the town, they lose it, we will not return"
403609,3110182,5,aqui41,09/08/2023,It is not an area but it is very good

403609,2665895,5,Gurb_c,12/04/2023,"THERE IS NO SEWAGE SERVICE!! It makes it very clear in the icons. there are several drains where, said by the mayoress, gray can be evicted without problem and filled with free water with a good flow and normal spout. The town is a 200m walk away! with a bar 7 days a week, a bakery until Sundays where they make butter cakes and homemade donuts that take your heart out..."
403609,2665584,1,KvKentzo,12/04/2023,"We didn't feel safe here, it was very lonely, not visible from the place. In the evening we drove on. Not possible to empty gray and black water, the sign for emptying in the park4night description should be removed, it is misleading. Only water can be taken"
403621,2866506,2,ruvand,18/06/2023,Nice views on the beach but somewhat unsafe. We tried to stay but two on a motorcycle approached us to see what we were doing or if we were inside or not and we decided to leave since there were no more vans/ac.
403621,2662868,2,SQ3,11/04/2023,Settlement in ruins outside... Nothing particularly attractive! We continued...
403658,2941535,1,BrigitteGuirao,09/07/2023,It is a prey without more. Access is by dirt road for about 4 km until you arrive. The photos exceed reality. Personally I have been quite disappointed with the site. The journey has not been worth it.
403658,2690824,4,olgal60,23/04/2023,Good place to rest. Maybe in summer there are a lot of mosquitoes.
403664,3200735,3,msubisaga,22/08/2023,"The place is not bad at all, the only thing is that the access to AC is not the best... It is a little neglected, but it fulfills the function of being able to eat quietly!! It has stone tables, shady trees and a small park... There are fountains but they don't work (they removed the taps). Horses loose in nature :))"
403664,3188160,1,Moniguadi,20/08/2023,"Hello. We didn't get to the area because the GPS put us between streets and we almost couldn't get out of between streets. We travel with a motorhome. I'm not rating it, it's simply the bad experience we've had. So that you take it into account"
403664,2991181,5,titisurfeur,20/07/2023,"Picnic area next to a disused soccer field (too bad), in the middle of the forest, lots of places but more suitable for vans (difficult climb), a few garbage cans, a car port in case of rain, plenty of hiking trails, walkers, locals with their dogs….. we enjoyed it!!"
403664,2960804,5,TxusM,14/07/2023,"Great place to totally disconnect. No services, except garbage cans. The people of the place are very very nice and the temperature is cool. The place is a bit abandoned (in its day it must have been incredible) it preserves a large esplanade with stone tables (in the shade of the trees) and another with goals to play soccer. Several viewpoints and paths to walk. Free horses in the area."
403665,2817530,4,currini,04/06/2023,The place is fine but there are few spaces for vehicles over 6m because most are battery. There are also buses to the center.
403676,3024527,3,kanau,26/07/2023,We parked a car 6.5 meters away and very well to spend the afternoon and see Cádiz. It is very central and you can go everywhere on foot. The parking meter is from Monday to Sunday from 8:00 to 21:00. We pay from 7:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. €1.75 is worth it for how close it is
403700,2843968,1,manuelschwarz,11/06/2023,"You are not really welcome if you want to stay for one night. Furthermore, it’s not possible to get the WLAN code, even if you wanna pay for it."
403700,2700647,4,Doc55,27/04/2023,"Small campsite right on the beach. Not many free places. The beach is long and has coarse sand. in the first row you are only 2 meters from the beach and 20 meters from the water. The place is very quiet and quite far from the city, which is also not particularly worthwhile. The sanitary facilities are fine."
403724,3295027,5,Pili8,14/09/2023,"Large new area, very well leveled and super quiet. Many thanks to the town hall"
403724,3253762,4,ManiobaLocoIvan,03/09/2023,"Technical stop to use services and continue the trip, it seems like a good area to spend the night. Completely new…I might not have made the sewage drain so high, better at ground level."

403724,3060612,3,Tetxulandia,02/08/2023,"As others say, the bell tower rings all night long and the pool bar closes late so hard to sleep. The pools are great and the sandwiches are great. However, we had to leave because flies and mosquitoes attacked us."
403724,3012831,5,Maitanetxu,24/07/2023,"On these dates are the main festivals of the town, the stage is placed next to the motorhome parking. The inhabitants of the village have welcomed us very well. Attached to the parking lot are the swimming pools, the entrance costs €3, ideal for taking a bath in the summer. Completely flat parking with a fountain. Highly recommended."
403724,2973427,4,Rujkus,16/07/2023,"The area is clean and level, with small stones on the ground. The water to fill is a fountain tap. It is next to the pool, good for taking a bath, but the bar terrace is open at night and if you want to sleep early you will have to do it with earplugs (in our case they left around 1am). From 07/21 to 23 /23 are the holidays and they are going to be held in that area"

403724,2880890,5,aigrisal,22/06/2023,"It is best accessed by the gravel road. The main one is now under construction. The area, great. All good, water, gray, flat, a bar that opens in summer. On June 21 they open a bar and swimming pools: 2, one for children, with a green area, umbrella, changing rooms, showers and toilets. They only charge €3 to access the pools. The town has hiking trails. Many thanks to the municipality for this site."
403724,2862218,4,psk_destroll,17/06/2023,"The place is very quiet and the town is very pretty, we have stopped for the night and it was fine. On the part of the channel (which is fenced) people pass, I say it to guide the van XD. There is no garbage nearby and there are no benches or tables."
403724,2853223,5,ruedines,14/06/2023,"Charming town, nice to visit. The parking lot is under construction but you can stay overnight and spend the night in peace. water service and gray and black drains."

Only drawback: the town bell that rang several times, but we still slept very well, we will repeat when we pass through this area :)"
403724,2814577,5,Angelsjavi,03/06/2023,"New area, recommended. We have slept very peacefully with another camper. Good place to stop and continue. Thanks to the town hall for giving us a part of their town. Enter as other users say by the gravel path but play the bass when entering"

403724,2767060,4,nice2seeu,20/05/2023,"Very quiet during my visit; I was only hearing the birds. As of this writing, I've been told that the bar and swimming pool will open soon. The access is easy as long as you avoid taking or leaving the street leading to the entrance of the area turning sharp from the road, because the ground makes a sharp kink. Just turn round behind the fountain."
403724,2747001,4,jordaco,13/05/2023,New and very quiet area. Do not be guided by the GPS or you will touch below. Enter through the gravel space and turn to the right of the yellow house and exit through the same place. My AC of 7.5 and no problems. Black water faucet a little uncomfortable since it does not stay still and emptying gray water you have to put it right on top otherwise all the water goes down.
403724,2698072,4,hoby,26/04/2023,Beautiful perched village with its storks. Very quiet night alone and very smiling neighborhood. Free services. Thanks to the community.

403724,2667471,2,Carthago-nl,13/04/2023,"Strange bald spot. But water and the like, so great. But quiet at very small (old) village. LOOK AFTER !!! Drive through the third street on the right, which goes well with bends (7 meters) but drive away through the direct street (1st street when you arrive) Below an incredible height kink. Only worked with run-up and slipping tires .... Touched the bottom of the camper between the front and rear wheels still .."
403724,2666328,3,andreasbr,13/04/2023,"good for overnight stay. no problem getting here with large 8.2m motorhome. do not go down the very steep incline, but drive in right below it."
403724,2657017,4,DracVila,10/04/2023,"New area with water, emptying black and gray water, flat and paved area. Next to the pool. They are building a bar/restaurant and it will be great. We have slept very well and peacefully, a 10. Many thanks to the Aguacil and the people for giving us these free services. Access to the town by a flat street to the right, do not enter from the front as you touch the ground."
403724,2653356,1,anitaludo,09/04/2023,The way to the cp is much too narrow and then another car parked in the street. And the other way is way too steep down. We drove on.
403728,2730235,5,Markb4226,07/05/2023,"our favourite place on this trip. Loads of parking down near the river,a place to fill with water and empty out on the main road next to the fire station,a fantastic historical town with great facilities. We stayed for a week. Enjoy the fishing!"
403728,2717205,5,Corine1981,02/05/2023,"Just lovely and quiet.
Easy to cool down a bit in the water.
Nice for children to build a water dam.

Easy access and accessible for large vehicles."
403729,2819204,1,katandgoretti,04/06/2023,"Steep and narrow road down to the parking spot, worse for all the parked cars on the side. We took one look and kept driving."
403729,2716680,1,carlosmgsilva,02/05/2023,"Very small space for motorhomes and a very dangerous area with several robberies, according to information from a resident. They tried to get into my AC during the night. To be avoided!!!"
403736,2784764,1,kellyvainlo,25/05/2023,Same as below - prohibited to camp here. Only park during the day.
403736,2783815,1,JosCiel,25/05/2023,"Yes, really fantastic place. Only it is not allowed to spend the night here. There are no prohibition signs, but also no signs that allow overnight stays. Moreover, it is a national park and you are not allowed to wild camp there. So we were told this morning at 8:00 am by the Portuguese police. We were kindly (but urgently) requested not to stay another night here..."
403736,2708900,5,Rool,30/04/2023,"Magnificent spot! Just after the lighthouse. No services of course, but a magnificent sunset! We had a wonderful evening. Fewer people on this spot, the other travelers stopping before, we were 3."
403757,3166115,5,kochi-96,17/08/2023,"arrived late as we left our previous place due to mosquitoes. This place was like an oasis for us. No mosquitoes, lots of cute bunnies jumping around us. quiet, only fewer cars and pedestrians passed by in the morning. supplemented the description of the place and the photos. If there is a football game there, it can get more crowded and loud"
403757,2647977,4,martinha10,07/04/2023,Picnic area next to it with shadows and the soccer field next to it. Quiet and quiet. Area for garbage collection and recycling.
403760,3271753,5,TereMartinez,08/09/2023,"A good place to sleep, quiet and safe."
403760,2934766,3,emma53,07/07/2023,"Quiet parking, in a quiet and secure area, 2 steps from the train station. We took the train to Bilbao, a 17-minute trip that dropped us off right in the center, all for €4 per person round trip. We stayed there for 2 nights, the police came by and didn't tell us anything."
403761,3059499,5,GoddamnGoat,01/08/2023,"Perfect to quickly fill up your water tank! No tube provided on the site so you need your own OR a (big) bottle! Parking is possible right beside on a small road into a field. Water was warm when we were there, for us no problem. The water pressure was also very good, filled ~15 liters in under 2 minutes. The people around were friendly and greeted us. Can recommend!"
403830,3285241,4,Bobbele83,11/09/2023,Great place to spend beach days :-) Operator very friendly!! Sanitary facilities could be a little better maintained but it was still possible!
403830,3229956,5,mikelvan80,28/08/2023,The location is amazing so close to the beach. The site is small and that makes it more welcoming and especially without queues for the bathrooms. The fact that they charge you for water is explained on some signs in the bathroom. The water problem in El Palmar was even on the news while we were there. We will definitely return because they have treated us great and everything was very clean.
403830,3229163,1,Maxdrive72,28/08/2023,"Too bad you can't give zero! I only needed to load water and not even unload, they told me they didn't have a rate to apply, so they asked me for 9 euros! Crazy stuff! One euro less than the next area, the only two in the absurd area!"
403830,3228192,4,prsoler90,27/08/2023,"It is expensive for what it offers. Clean site, well located and with large plots always in the sun."
403830,3213538,1,belenplaza,25/08/2023,"The location is so central that you have the music of the beach bars that sounds like yours. The worst thing was not that, but at 00:32 they began to carry out some work parallel to the motorhome with a very noisy tractor and machinery, all very pleasant for the money you pay to spend the night on a dirt esplanade"
403830,3210990,1,leiremclouis,24/08/2023,"In 7 years that I have been a camper I have never seen anything so bad. 19 euros overnight 5euros electricity 5euros filling and emptying water. 29 euros, and it's a dirt parking lot with no shadows, if you want to fill and empty go and look for the key who knows which caravan driver has it. I have never seen anything so bad, to the point that I left and they gave me my money back. I don't mind paying, but if you pay it's because it's worth it"
403830,3200460,4,sonnita186,22/08/2023,"We only spent one day but they let us enter the overnight area. We were able to shower and use the toilets. We went at the beginning of August and the truth is that they were clean. We really liked this area because it wasn't very crowded and it was much smaller than the main one, which seems to me like they are all canned. For the day they charge you €10 and if you want to compliment the one I haven't, add the €9. Very Kind!"
403830,3179941,4,Ponfe,19/08/2023,"Excellent location a step away from the beach, so the price is right. The plots are of a good size and it is true that there is a lot of land and there are no shadows, it would be nice if they put a tree. Showers and toilets were clean and there were no queues. You can hear the music from the beach bar next door but it is true that it stops around two in the morning. I recommend this area"
403830,3173486,4,Marielas_87,18/08/2023,"Area with an excellent location and services, somewhat excessive the 5 euros of emptying and filling. There are no pipelines in the area, they charge in all areas"
403830,3173149,3,rizosalbai,18/08/2023,"The Area, this normal, the plots are small and are full of ants, the showers are few and not very clean and the women's area is quite bad and the three days we have been there they have not even gone to repair a shower. I see it bad that you have to pay for emptying gray water and the poti and refilling the water tank 5 euros. The best is the proximity of the beach."
403830,3158264,5,ikerBilVan,16/08/2023,"We have passed the bridge that the parking lot was full and the bathrooms were clean and there was no waiting for the bathroom or for the shower. The location, as everyone says, is incredible in front of the sea. 19 euros in high season just for that location seems fair to me. As we arrived we parked and we didn't have to move the van at all since it is next to shops, bars and restaurants"
403830,3156641,5,Enrique-Romero,16/08/2023,"We have been a couple of days and it has been great. Highly recommend, Clean toilets, well located and helpful staff. In particular, the person in charge of the entrance, Juanma, kind, friendly and attentive to everyone. We will repeat."
403830,3146018,1,inmadubita,14/08/2023,"It depends on the number of nights you tell them, they tell you it's busy or it's free. I first asked for one night and it was busy. At the same time my partner asked for the same date but 3 nights and coincidentally he was free. In the end, we went to Palmar for 3 nights but to another place, they seem to be quite tricky. CAREFUL"
403830,3145651,1,Antxon88,14/08/2023,"The location site is very good but you have to pay for all the services including the unloading of gray and black and even for washing the dishes, which is the same place where you wash clothes, luckily they didn't charge for going to the bathroom (that's Yes, it does have a roll of paper because there isn't one) because it's the only thing free, come on, it's a business, I will definitely not be back"
403830,3145568,2,colmass88,14/08/2023,"In a very good area and close to the beach, very little cleaning of the bathrooms, lack of personnel to assign the plots, since they are not enough, the plots are dirty and with little maintenance, it is a pity that for the money paid they do not have better conditions, I hope they improve and have more staff."
403830,3135063,3,Inharr,13/08/2023,"Site with good projection and facilities, although some shade would be appreciated, otherwise the management is terrible, we had problems both making a reservation since they did not reserve us and then there were no plots with electricity as well as with the registry that they keep of plots Clearly there is a lack of staff both to clean (dirty bathrooms) and to manage the camper park"
403830,3119458,5,amaiaaltuna,11/08/2023,It is worth paying 19 euros for being so close to the sea and in the liveliest area of El Palmar. The bathrooms were clean and new except when uncivilized people enter in front of you. The site is small which I prefer and there are several men's and women's toilets and showers. We have never had to wait in line for anything (which is not usual in these places) and the staff has been super friendly.
403830,3085535,1,daruga,06/08/2023,"Very poorly conditioned site. Abusive prices for the plot and on top of that you have to pay to shower and wash the dishes. At night there is no water because it runs out, and on top of that there are only 4 toilets and 4 showers that are always disgusting. Very small plots and with more land than on the beach itself. They take advantage of the opportunity cost. For this it is better to sleep in a parking lot and that's it."
403830,3081273,5,dpozas,05/08/2023,"Very well located place, perhaps the music from the places next door can bother you if you are looking for tranquility, but it is the counterpart to being so close to Del Mar… Friendly staff, clean bathrooms, everything perfect."
403830,3072954,3,AUTOCARAVIAJAND,04/08/2023,"Area under construction, they should put loose stone instead of sand, it's a cloud of dust, the music is on until 2 am but at a bearable volume, with some earplugs we slept perfectly considering that you go to bed around 1 am until 9/10 total silence. New bathrooms, hot shower with €1 token 5min. enough to shower. Expensive for what it offers, €14 would be fair"
403830,3072196,2,Feliz10,03/08/2023,"The atmosphere is good, the beach is close but the area is more land than on the beach and the music is loud until late in the morning"
403830,3068505,3,Atlas91,03/08/2023,"Ideal location because it is central, in front of the sea. However, noisy parking lot, surrounded by bars with music. Possibility of emptying but not of refilling with water. Very small pitches and just a few sanitary facilities. 24 euros pitch + electricity"
403830,3058601,4,pakitaontour,01/08/2023,"A place in a privileged environment, right in front of the beach. closed and secure area. Comfortable pitches and clean bathrooms, very attentive staff. We have spent two very comfortable days. Of course highly recommended. We will repeat for sure. Thank you Juanma"
403830,3042923,4,MontseyDioni,29/07/2023,"perfect location!!!! we will definitely be back!!! close to bars, shops and beach. totally recommended. Nomad beach la caña, live performances every day!!!!!!"
403830,3042651,4,dionimontse,29/07/2023,"Great place close to everything, beach bars, restaurants, places to drink with live performances, etc... they are still preparing some areas but highly recommended."
403830,3022155,5,jsbmartin83,26/07/2023,The location is perfect. It is worth paying 19 euros in the middle of July to be in front of the beach and next to bars and shops. We haven't moved the van at all. The toilets and showers are new and clean. The Nomada beach bar a cane !!! Live music every day. We've had a great time and we'll be back as soon as we can.
403830,3006755,3,estefilzty,23/07/2023,"Good location but a disaster everything else. We paid for a plot with electricity, and to our surprise in the morning we had almost no battery in the Camper because we had been plugged in for nothing. It is compacted earth, and the facilities in general are very poor. They have a lot to improve"
403830,3000319,1,Azemur,22/07/2023,It's expensive because people go and prices rise based on demand. Do not go and you will see how they put affordable prices.
403830,2995942,1,sayma003,21/07/2023,"We travel with the application, directly to this car park for the services, location and good comments, on the page it does not say anything about a minimum stay, or book in advance or anything....we arrived and having plots available, it tells us that it has to be a minimum of 2 nights, with which we travel in vain because they do what they want, and little or no kindness."
403830,2985679,4,natiuska9,19/07/2023,"The location is great, next to the beach. The bathroom is a bit small but it is generally clean. Shower €1, 7 minutes The only drawback is that it is behind a couple of bars and you can hear the music but hey, I think they close at 2 or 3 in the morning, plugs and that's it."
403830,2981124,5,jsbmartin83,18/07/2023,"The location is great, I was recommended by a friend who surfs and actually from the van to the beach right with the towel. The showers and toilets are new and clean. As there are few places, the site is very familiar. They have a very nice beach bar at the entrance and the food is very good. We ordered dinner to go, but in the end we decided to stay because there was a live concert."
403830,2978999,2,somoslauyjavi,17/07/2023,We spent the day for €10. In the same area where the cars park. Right next to it there is one that you can spend the day for only €4 and also another option Caravan area el palmar for €10 and you enjoy the same services as if you spent the whole day with the possibility of deploying an awning and taking out chairs and much better facilities
403830,2958847,4,MarLoren,13/07/2023,"Good area at the foot of the beach with bars, restaurants with live music and craft markets The area seemed reasonable price €20 without electricity and €25 with electricity €3 well, loading water €3 WC flushing €3 flushing water €7 washing machine 7 €1 dryer €1 shower (7 minutes of water). The price for the services is due to the fact that the Palmar area does not have drains. The girl at the reception very friendly!"
403830,2942300,5,antoniog0417,09/07/2023,"Magnificent place, worth it, on the beach itself, bars with live music. Supermarkets very close,"
403830,2936080,2,jess31,08/07/2023,"The area is fine, although without shade, not at all quiet, if you are looking to rest at night, not because of the bar, it is more for those who come to party then they follow it here in their vehicles and it becomes impossible to rest, they throw garbage outside from your site and so on, no one watches this, a bit of a mess, paying seems like anything goes"
403830,2936021,1,danibip,08/07/2023,"painful, pity that with the place that they have everything revolves around money, €19 irregular plots that do not even allow to open the awning, bushes, no shade, €3 to fill or empty, €5 for the light jjj adds and continues ... and the worst, 20 percent are drunk cars that have nothing to do with the Camper world, shouts and voices. (I guess you can't generalize but next to our three cars together"
403830,2919284,3,Urtzifis,03/07/2023,"Close to the beach but right in the middle of the beach bars. We hired 3 places together and when we arrived the first ones were reserved for us, although later they put others in and in the end we were separated... A good option for young people who want to go out but to rest it is not the best option."
403830,2917734,3,nhernandez,03/07/2023,"The place is impressive, next to a very cool beach. The area €24/night with light, we found it excessive. In addition, showers and scrubbing taps are paid. Ideal if you go for a party, the beach bar in the area is great to eat. But sleeping is difficult, the music is loud until 3 in the morning and then the noise continues. Party zone."
403830,2915047,1,mariapa4182,02/07/2023,"For those who like the beach, it has a spectacular location. It is nowhere near the beach and in the middle of the nightlife area. And therefore it is impossible to rest. There is a bar attached that has music at full volume until 3 in the morning to which it joins, that when it ends, the people who are marching loudly continue until they feel like it. Nobody puts order and everything is paid, few places with electricity"
403830,2911904,1,napiolas,01/07/2023,"A secarral without any grace, and on top of that they have a bar where they play music to the fullest until three in the morning... they bother their clients... incredible, I don't recommend it at all."
403830,2893803,4,famdamgo,26/06/2023,Perfect situation some sand but good perfect bathrooms and perfect showers close to all services even with strong lift not so windy parked
403830,2867803,3,Loloiodei,18/06/2023,"Close to the beach, restaurants and night bars. No shade. Showers and toilets quite clean. The showers and sinks for washing paid, as well as the emptying and filling of water. A pity that there are users who are not very respectful of the rest. Music with excessive volume at any time, even at night, when there are party venues very close. In our opinion a little expensive."
403830,2857032,1,mclouis879,15/06/2023,"An area on the sunny side like most areas, it's fine but the expensive price I can't explain it to me if I don't use anything it's fine that those who want showers or services should pay separately but for a simple parking that money is being spent In my opinion, we continue to lock ourselves in between 4 fences, in short, life in freedom is killing us, we have to lock ourselves in, yes or yes."
403830,2849387,5,manusilga,13/06/2023,"Privileged location in El Palmar, in front of the beach and in the area of beach bars and markets. In the beach bar in the area itself you eat great. They have some auctions left because it is very new, but in my opinion it will be the best area in the area in a short time. The prices are according to the offer of the area."
403830,2822676,3,JJALM,05/06/2023,"We have been very comfortable for 2 days, if it is true that it has deficiencies and aspects to improve that are not in accordance with the price but are still under construction and even so it has been worth it. We will be back"
403830,2816105,2,campercadiz80,03/06/2023,Very expensive!!! €19 + €5 (electricity) + €3 (water drainage) and on top of that it is not completely finished… I will not be back!!!
403830,2771619,1,jupersan,21/05/2023,"Very expensive, electricity and water apart"
403830,2761075,4,park4nightha,18/05/2023,"We were 2 days on the pitch. Very nice reception, also in German. Location and proximity to the beach could not be better. The beach is great and there are many restaurants. The pitch is fairly new. V/E area is exemplary. Sanitary facilities very nicely designed and clean. The plots could offer a meter more space in width. One star deducted because of the price."
403830,2749866,5,raquelramosn,14/05/2023,"Very new, still missing some things like lights in the bathrooms and mirrors. It seems they have set up the system for coin operated showers and sinks but there is still free hot water. Some places with a light socket and tap and others not. There is no shadow."
403830,2732544,4,abuelosardina,07/05/2023,"I made a negative comment a few days ago about this area and it has been deleted. Where they say they charge €20 and the free services are not true, they also charge €5 for electricity plus €3 for changing the water."

403830,2717352,3,Ta87,02/05/2023,Area that is not finished but the price is as if it had all the services there is no light in the lady's toilet coat rack in the showers they charge me €1 to wash the dishes in some sinks where there are no places to put things they don't have washing machine and small plots where you can't open the full awning (I have a Mercedes Vito) I've crossed the bridge and I don't know if I'll be back
403830,2714885,5,ivannoe1980,01/05/2023,"New area in El Palmar, in front of the beach, all services: showers, sinks and water changes. Delimited and spacious plots. Unbeatable location and attentive staff. Various types of rates depending on whether you are going to park or spend the night."

403854,2723512,4,Sonja12,04/05/2023,The view is superb with reflection of pink clouds on the water at sunset. In the distance we heard many shots of hunters. And unfortunately again and again there is a heap of junk not far from the site... However the place is quiet. There is enough to run or hike around the lake.
403854,2696624,5,fortimfordtransit,25/04/2023,"Beautiful place, unfortunately littered, but a lot of possibilities to stand here. Access is a bit narrow for mobile homes, but possible, no problem for vans. Definitely recommendable :) Mega view of the lake, especially in the evening with sunset. Perfect for escaping the heat, dutch shade from the trees."

There is a beautiful path that takes you to the lighthouse, a must see. Quiet night, no annoying noise"
403863,3193432,3,erharacamper,21/08/2023,"large car park without services and shade. view and coast phenomenal. access road a bit narrow here and there. it's worth walking to the lighthouse and the rocky outcrop at the end of the car park, a truly stunning spot!"
403863,3190926,5,Youlivan,20/08/2023,"The place is spectacular, this place has little time left, it's a pity I've seen vans occupying more than one place with chairs and tables (without letting other cars, vans and motorhomes park) I've seen a gray water drum empty from a van I have seen people making barbecues and leaving the place dirty, endless barbarities, then we complain that they prohibit us from doing things"
403863,3181468,2,maiknait,19/08/2023,"The place is fine, you sleep quietly and have good views, but the entrance and exit are along the same very narrow path, in sections two cars are just right (or they would not fit), to go with Ac I do not see it since the narrow section is about 500 meters."
403863,3171963,4,Juliarttero,18/08/2023,"We have spent one night and I would give it 5 stars if it were not for the inclination. Incredible views and you can walk to the Ajo lighthouse through an impressive walk along the cliffs. Perfect place to stay to sleep after sunset, taking into account that there is no service."
403863,3164684,4,Etrusquita,17/08/2023,"Full in August. The parking lot is for visiting the caves and the Ajo lighthouse. In the middle of the afternoon, the cars that come to visit and the vans and AC gather. It is advisable to arrive early or be patient and wait for the visiting cars to leave"
403863,3158612,5,lulamy,16/08/2023,"We have slept very well, without noise and incredible views! We were more than 20 ac / camper. narrow but paved arrival path. Walk to caves and by cliff to the very nice garlic lighthouse. Let's keep taking care of it and not leaving trash."
403863,3149945,4,Ontavan,15/08/2023,Very quiet and beautiful place. Near the cliffs. It's a pity that people don't park well because there are many campers.

403863,3094904,5,DiegoGarcial,07/08/2023,"Magnificent place to spend the night. Very spacious, with beautiful walks in the surroundings as well as very quiet. The access can be somewhat narrow if you find a car in front of you but there are sidings, so it's not a problem either."
403863,3079688,5,VeraLis,05/08/2023,"This site is incredible, it has beautiful walks along the cliffs, next to some caves where you can see the sea. On August 4 we were about 29 vehicles, mostly campers and even cars. Very quiet at night. The arrival is not difficult but it is a one way road. Next to the Ajo lighthouse. The only bad thing is that there is a cement fence that makes it a bit ugly."
403863,3077576,5,flamingoblue33,04/08/2023,"Superb view, good atmosphere, nice walk to the lighthouse, lots of wind! On one side you will have the sunset, on the other the sunrise :)"

Good place to sleep. We parked in a level ""plaza"" so we slept comfortably. Plenty of space to park where you like. A few meters away some good views and a lighthouse"
403863,2991066,3,maudtheo,20/07/2023,"Bivouac with lots of places and a beautiful view but difficult to find privacy to go to the toilet, starting from the heavy traffic all day and evening."

403863,2834166,4,Roonoo,08/06/2023,There is indeed a restriction barrier at 2m but this one was open so we went there. 2 other campervans and a caravan were with us. There is a path below that leads to a cave.
403863,2750139,3,clau2000,14/05/2023,"Narrow access road, at the entrance of the parking lot there was a 2-meter barrier. Quiet place for campers, there is a path next to it with good views but the parking itself is surrounded by a wall that does not let you see them."

403867,2664258,5,BartNomade,12/04/2023,"We found this place by chance, after having drained the waters and supplied ourselves with clean water in the parking lot that is a few meters from this place. There were over 15 campers parked when we arrived. The land is very level and the ground is grass, which is an advantage. We spent a very peaceful night there."
403885,2787874,4,Gaelle3412,26/05/2023,"Parked for the night, no problem and the municipal police passed by without telling us. Flat and very spacious land at the water's edge but filled with waste so swimming there is out of the question. Maybe go further along the coast to find unmarked spots and with a real beach"
403885,2770721,4,SaskiaCarolin,21/05/2023,"The place is right on the water, you have a lot of options where you can stand. Be careful when it rains as the ground gets very muddy. There is no beach."

403885,2701559,5,micheldavidetemilie,27/04/2023,good quiet place facing the sea no trash please do not leave this waste. Only small disadvantages the ground which in case of rain can quickly become very sticky (sandy black ground)
403885,2700148,5,barou,27/04/2023,Well settled along the sea. Many places without being on top of each other. Let the sound of the waves rock you at night. No service or trash so we keep this place clean. Good wifi coverage...
403890,3263889,5,DaliainKnaus,06/09/2023,"Of the 3 car parks there, this is the best. We sleep during the week, alone and calm. Flat, with containers. Next to the Balconies of Madrid. In GPS search by soccer field so as not to get lost. The road is fine for any vehicle."
403890,3186023,4,chunpilar,20/08/2023,"Place as indicated in the description, photos 3 and 4 are not of this place, you have to get to the soccer field where the path begins to visit the Balcons de Madrid, 1 km from the town. Very flat, paved, with good access, no services (please don't leave paper on the field), picnic tables and rubbish bins. There are no prohibition signs."
403890,2857158,1,Juancar2021,15/06/2023,"2 km from the town, without services, without shade, the coordinates are wrong and they take you to a public parking lot in the town that is supposedly for cars. As we thought we were in the motorhome, we slept there although it stood out a lot and nobody told us anything, I suppose that due to the time of year there are few people. The last photo is where Google maps takes you."
403898,2672278,5,Mejillones,15/04/2023,"Great for a stopover on the way. Easy access from the AP-7. Shade, water and garbage. You cannot park next to the tables but very close, in front."

403947,3050001,4,LynneBakewell,31/07/2023,A nice clean area with plenty of parking in shade. Next to a park so is handy if you have a dog. Bars and restaurants in walking distance.

403982,2650440,5,TinisonTour,08/04/2023,"During our stay in Torrox we visited Cassandra, Karina and Wolfgang several times in the Backstübel. There are super delicious baked goods, bread, cakes, tarts. Whether it's a late breakfast with Mett rolls and eggs, a delicious Jäger Schnitzel for lunch or a fantastic cake and a juicy Nusskirchkuchen in the afternoon, it was always excellent and we were served warmly."
403983,2690718,5,xavimat,23/04/2023,"Very quiet night. Large and fairly level parking. No services. Very small and pretty town, with restaurants."
403983,2689059,5,Senent84,22/04/2023,"We slept in this parking lot, very quiet, there were only two vans. The parking lot is quite large, only medium-sized vans can access the town, since some turns are narrow. Although it can also be accessed from the Collao or Vistabella port without entering through Xodos."
403991,3184580,5,sranaranja,20/08/2023,One of the nicest places we have spend the night with our rooftop tent. Amazing views and very quiet. Highly recommended. There’s a bar aprox 400 meters from the place.
403991,3143729,4,NanouArmando,14/08/2023,"Large parking space. Perfect for CC Magnificent view of the river and the mountains. Quiet at night. Leisure and swimming pool (2€) nearby. Good restaurant. Too bad some people throw their trash. Anyway, thank you to the municipality. We recommend !"

403991,3067401,5,Maggyulito,03/08/2023,"Very wide esplanade, ideal for large motorhomes. Very quiet place, we have spent 2 nights. In the surroundings there are several wineries. The yacht club bar eats very well. On August 4 and 5 they will celebrate the town festivals in the adjoining space."
403991,2983712,5,Viaxeiro20,18/07/2023,"A true paradise to spend the night next to the reservoir. Leisure areas and cafeteria. Close to Ribadavia and the Ribeiro wineries. Ideal if you take paddle surf, kayak, wind surf, etc."
403991,2736931,5,Robur,09/05/2023,"Fits. The green is currently being maintained, the place is becoming even more beautiful. Also ideal for large campers and families, small fitness area, benches and plenty of space to romp around. strange that I am completely alone here in mid-May. Also great for a short break from the highway tour. The water tap is at the next access road, by the power pole."

404003,3063276,4,Ninita3,02/08/2023,"A quiet and beautiful place but do not expect to see even a little bit of water. Hot days are pretty bad. The reservoir is completely dry as far as the eye can see, you will only see bushes and cows."
404003,2886997,3,sincoordenadas,24/06/2023,"It is true that it is a good place, but not everything is so beautiful. Lots of cow poop, lots of flies and it's just pure countryside, don't expect much, stubble, mud, sand, the said countryside. Entrance somewhat complicated, unevenness and good gaps. Friendly cows, but they are still loose cows."
404003,2820130,5,alexdm11,04/06/2023,"Two entries but the nicest is the one directly after the exit, because it gives access to the natural water reserve. Very nice place, very calm with animals in the small awakening"
404003,2681151,5,TitiLeejoice,19/04/2023,"It is indeed a very beautiful location in the middle of nature, very quiet because it is outside the urban area. As it is for a natural grazing area, there is a small Canadian passage (about 3 m wide) at the entrance to prevent the herds from escaping through there. I passed with my motorhome of 2.25 m. Have a nice stay here if you come."

404079,2967808,4,MarianSV,15/07/2023,"Don't worry, I'm alone in July. Good place if you go with animals, away from the road and shaded. In the pantanet there is a small access to the water at the end of it."
404079,2774683,5,bikesonworldtour,22/05/2023,"Quiet area with shade and BBQ facilities, water is available and rubbish bins. Very clean, beautiful lake, friendly people, everything very relaxed, much more pleasant than on the coast. On the outskirts of Ulldecona is an inexpensive gas station and a well-stocked Chinese. Top. Approach from the west without problems."
404104,2796923,5,voyageriri,29/05/2023,Shower in the men's toilets in the small park. Free access to the park (check the opening hours on the internet). The water is cold but very good flow. Parking right next to the park.

404130,3070283,3,Bierus13,03/08/2023,a perfect place! only the slope back up should have your speed ahead ... it is very slippery and not recommended for a heavy old camper. Got on it with my Volkswagen T4 with the help of some beach goers!
404130,2914772,4,vallenato,02/07/2023,"A very nice and quiet place. It is in an accessible place but it does have a slight slope to park. The bad thing is that it has a tap on the beach, and to go with the water carrying… There is a bar and services"
404156,2996752,5,SimonEtMarie,21/07/2023,Very calm and nice view on the village. There is a barrier at the entrance which was open then you have to go around the church to park behind it.
404187,3283365,5,Dede_l_Jean-ti,11/09/2023,"Superb place and apart from a little noise on the opposite bank (young locals) until nightfall, then it was quiet... a Sunday evening in September, I should point out. 4G works well."
404187,3183160,3,Hugal38,19/08/2023,"We spent one night at this place for a stopover, it did the trick. Pros: Isolated location, small river for swimming and easy access from the highway. Cons: very bumpy path to get there with a sign at the entrance to the path suggesting that it is a private area, noise and several car trips to and from the area during the night (young partygoers), dirty."
404187,3078489,5,landefender,05/08/2023,"Although there is still a festival going on at 04:45 with very loud music, we could of course also have gone there to join in the fun, I'm glad it's quiet so we can enjoy this beautiful environment here for a while and can score another local breakfast and otherwise hop on to Santiago de Compostela places like this make the drive beautiful"
404187,3038096,5,RRM,29/07/2023,Beautiful spot next to the river with benches and large bins. No water or toilets. Very quiet at night. To find it cross the bridge on Carr. St Marta and then turn left about 50m into a dirt road the goes in between the fields. Enjoy :)
404187,2906163,5,choosvanlyf,29/06/2023,"Gorgeous spot! Other side of the river opposite the motor home carpark. Go along the dirt track through the crop fields to get here, it is public access as there are picnic benches and bins here. Peace and love x"

404224,3149214,4,chrispn33620,15/08/2023,"Possibility to park just after the police station coming from the commercial area in front of the international school. The police say nothing. Place a little noisy but frankly given the lack of parking we will not complain. On the other hand, do not unpack all your equipment in order to keep this possibility. And leave clean when you leave there are enough bins."
404224,3141227,5,aellea,14/08/2023,"It is not the first time we have come, we have been using it from time to time to move around the area and it is very good, the Mosos (police) are next door, there is a Mercadona very close, although the downside of this is that they have a height barrier so parking there is a bit difficult, I walk from the sleeping area, it takes 5 minutes."
404224,2781727,5,IngeLarsenOnTour,24/05/2023,Free parking. We parked out car here all day when We visiting port aventura park. 10 minuts away from the park. There’s a lot of space here
404231,3283849,5,sleepycamper111,11/09/2023,Amazing place on the river. We were there all alone in the woods that night. Bit tricky to find. The easiest road is the one that goes as a straight line into San migeul del pino.
404231,3190287,5,Ismael69,20/08/2023,"I spent only one night at the site. The place is very beautiful, quite flat and most impressively, super quiet. It is far from the town, the final part of the road is not asphalt but you can get there without any problem. I have saved the place in case I have to spend the night in the area"
404231,3178979,5,zanetazazu,19/08/2023,"Very beautiful and peaceful place. Night was quiet, just a few mosquitoes, which is normal near river. Far from the city so the night sky was amazing. Stayed for one night. In the morning there’s less shade as the sun rises above the river. Very few bikers passed nearby. Overall great spot!"
404231,3105964,4,pierkho33,09/08/2023,"If you come from Valladolide do not follow the GPS, a complicated place to access with possible scratches on your vehicle, leave from the next village and go up to the point"

404231,2989885,5,T4Marven,19/07/2023,"By far the best place we have had so far. Just outside of the town of San Miguel, very quiet (except for the cicadas yelling at you all day) we were alone and had a wonderful night together on the waterfront. I can recommend to everyone."

404231,2927125,3,deealice,05/07/2023,"In itself a nice place, but you can't save yourself from flies (as of July). We just fled to the roof tent to be able to spend the evening in peace. Okay for one night."

404231,2743625,5,ariellenvan,12/05/2023,"Nice and clear place, we had a great evening! When entering the forest, there are 2 possibilities to access the spot, the photo of the description corresponds to the second, but the first is surely good too - therefore possibility of several vehicles. A machine noise at the end of the day, we don't really know what, which stopped afterwards. Swimming not really possible."
404231,2730182,5,CarolynTlse,07/05/2023,Superb place on the banks of the Douro! Please keep it clean. A beautiful tranquility to spend the night.

404236,3087804,5,Poladesiero,06/08/2023,Quiet and nice place. Totally recommended.
404236,2890174,3,ul.schmid,25/06/2023,Many places under big trees. Lots of trash in the bushes. No services and no service other than 4 bins of different colors. Quite muddy when it rains.

404272,2730847,3,CattinJ,07/05/2023,"What a waste of police time, to let campers in to a car park!! 
Flat ground, no shade. Supermarket and cafe/bar opposite. Felt secure.
A bit noisy from nearby carpark on Saturday night but not too bad.
Lacking in any charm but ok for a night.
€5 including electric seems an OK price."
404272,2670883,3,Tornjak,14/04/2023,"Free parking accessible to all sizes. Adjoining the municipal area which was quickly completed, it is on gravel and partially level. Useful for parking as soon as the area is full there is no service. Optimal satellite and 4G reception. Ideally located for the well-being of dogs, its proximity to the city center, restaurants and supermarket is very practical."
404272,2653327,3,bg_alberto,09/04/2023,"We spent here Saturday night since the motorhome area was full, according to the police we could spend the night there. We slept quite level when compensating for the inclination with the lower height of the front of the motorhome, even so at the bottom the existing spaces were flat. Being in an urban center, some car can be heard at night."

But leaving the vehicle with objects unattended is better than not, just like sleeping in the vehicle. I've been living near there all my life and it's somewhat conflictive, it's better to look for another area in Comarruga, there are several much better and safer parking lots"
404311,3178958,5,benjamin1977,19/08/2023,Perfect place for a rest and even spend the night with drinking water bathrooms and very quiet and clean

404311,3085998,3,ciervalo,06/08/2023,Flat site next to a park with clean open restrooms. Constant noise of cars 24 hours a day. For a good night and also the town deserves it.
404311,3020899,3,Ft,25/07/2023,"It is next to the road, there is noise, although it is not excessive (I sleep with earplugs and I slept perfectly). Shady park, very nice. Public toilets and water. Ideal for visiting Pontedeume. Playa de la Magdalena 5 minutes away, which includes a beach for pets."

404311,2913622,5,JCYJDR,02/07/2023,"We decided to stop to sleep in this small place because of the ease of access and the location in front of the bridge and a park. It is visible, although behind it seems that there is another area to assess and more hidden."

404332,3206719,4,Str84,23/08/2023,"The access is quite narrow, but it is easy to get there, indeed it is only for one vehicle, there are walkers, but you can't even hear it. The place is very beautiful. There are no trees, but we have been very comfortable anyway. There is no indication that you cannot be there, and no one has bothered us"
404332,3120470,5,Clocissou34,11/08/2023,Absolutely amazing! A beautiful view of absolute calm. Perfect for a van .. be careful with the motorhome because the U-turn will be very complicated or even impossible
404332,3100107,5,carolinelegault31480,08/08/2023,Superb spot. We spent the night in a quiet van. Beautiful hiking trails and beautiful sunset and sunrise.
404332,2864125,1,LorraineundManuel,17/06/2023,Definitely don't go down. Especially not with more than 5 m. You can not turn and in reverse gear up the steep single lane road is not an option either.

on top of that there is a house tops 30m away from a house, really feels like we bother. 
that said, the view is nice

ps: for other workers, no internet at all here (Spot above there is but we don't seem very welcome there either)"
404332,2726174,5,MTBulli93,05/05/2023,"Wonderful spot! Super nice view super quiet, mega sea view and great sunset! Turn Vodafone 5G network super hard once the space is occupied"
404332,2705742,4,samedata,29/04/2023,ATTENTION: A gravel path starts from the large transmission mast (cannot be overlooked). Do not use this!!! It is a dead end with no turning possibility! I had immense problems with the motorcycle. Just stand in front of the transmission mast. Then it's great! :)
404332,2688526,2,dieRiedls,22/04/2023,"The way there and down is concrete, but narrow. There is space for three cars (locals like to come here) OR a van. If you park your car there, there are only very bad turning possibilities. The place is also not very flat. We wouldn't drive down here with a mobile home."
404332,2677233,5,pilpocourt,17/04/2023,Thanks to Park4night and those who share for this amazing place! Only one place and a house right next to it. No access to the sea but beautiful sand to the west about 3km.

404351,3011202,3,Apablo1,24/07/2023,We spent the night here with no problem. Next to the road but hardly any cars pass. There is the park next door with tables and a fountain.

404351,2654094,5,lordbollo,09/04/2023,"We stopped here to eat and very calm, really. We also take the opportunity to fill water. There are about 6 parking lots, only a few houses around."
404362,3196953,4,jordanien,22/08/2023,"Lidl parking lot with 10 spaces, very good security, the parking lot is equipped with cameras. Lidl hours 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., it has toilets open during these times. Negative point, the noise, the main road is - 100m away, a dirt road passes 03m behind us and it is littered with dirt and papers."
404363,3168650,4,JORDI2EURA,17/08/2023,"I had been there years ago and yes all the services were there. In August 2023 only empty grays, although there are always dirty ones who also empty blacks. It is a pity."
404364,3248690,5,DaWoita,02/09/2023,"A well-paved site with incredible views of the Strait of Gibraltar and the African continent with the Moroccan mountains. If you look at the sea, there is a large wind turbine directly to your right, which you can clearly hear. Just like the vehicles on the road about 50 meters away. However, I didn't find either of these to be bothersome."
404364,2796930,5,voyageriri,29/05/2023,"Several locations available on the different accessible paths. There is something for everyone, small, large and large vehicles. View of Morocco, on the other hand, beware of the network, you risk capturing the Moroccan network, beware of the non-package!"
404370,3256324,3,Fiabitz,04/09/2023,"We slept in a camper pitch in front of the estuary. Nice view, but a plot of land and it gets muddy with the rain. Be careful! Our camper was filled with hundreds of ants even with the windows closed, they still come out inside a week later. We were there less than 24 hours. Simple campsite, very good hot water shower. To empty sewage you have to go there with the tank in hand"
404370,3221504,1,camama,26/08/2023,"ANTHILL!! The van was filled with ants, a big problem, to which the reception told me that it is because of the food, we travel in the van, obviously taking food inside and also that there are ants in the field, I am going from camping to camping and Nothing like this has ever happened to me, the entire van inside and out full of ants"
404370,3201704,1,losviajesdecandela,22/08/2023,"Nice staff except for the cleaner who didn't let us shower Agusto and leaving the bathrooms muddy and twice we went one night each time the van ended up full of ants.. we told the owner and he replied that there are ants in the campsites…. And I say that in some there are anthills and pests, beware"
404370,2877811,4,PitBro,21/06/2023,"Small campsite at the end of the VV6, we got a place through the friendly and helpful operator, sanitary facilities simple but clean, €20 for 2 people + van including electricity. Unfortunately there is no bread in the morning"

404370,2862286,1,mikesham,17/06/2023,"I don't understand the previous reviews. called the day before and told there were plenty of places. when we arrived tents and campervan's were packed in like sardines. the plot we were given was between a large tent and a campervan, no room to move. After much difficulty to manouvre our van we left. not as described on the site"
404370,2833258,1,Raymondsuchet,08/06/2023,the GPS reading is not good and the campsite is not indicated by signs otherwise very good
404370,2733157,5,Nicaline,08/05/2023,Small campsite right on the spectacular estuary. Sanitary simple but clean and with hot water. In the low season (until June) only open on weekends (Fri-Mon). Reservation by email very easy and super friendly. 2 pax & van 20€. There are only 8 pitches and all are in the front row right on the water.
404370,2720239,5,villa134,03/05/2023,Beautiful views of the water…
404370,2687945,5,mariacangas,22/04/2023,Small but very familiar campsite. Spacious pitches and very friendly staff. We will definitely be back!!
404383,3169451,4,SandraVan18,17/08/2023,"Satisfactory free parking for visiting Barcelona for a day. The metro is a 10 min walk away and takes you to the center in around 40 minutes. We found our van intact (which, apparently, is a luxury in Barcelona). The big positive: it is outside the low emission zone."
404383,3122671,5,PenningtonPile,11/08/2023,"Ideal for spending the day in Barcelona, Line 10 station 10min walk. Other cars parked so rather reassuring. The area is not in the Barcelona ZBE, because to enter Barcelona you have to register on a city site and pay 6€ (low emission restriction). here it is not and parking is free"
404386,3242788,3,JJRibes,31/08/2023,It is a good place to park if you want to take a route BUT a municipal security guard warned us that it is only for residents.
404386,2927070,5,josepmerida,05/07/2023,Very quiet parking. We had a very pleasant night
404387,2893423,2,chjohn,26/06/2023,100 meters to the beach between a lot of rubbish. No view of the sea because everything is built up with straw hats at the front of the beach. We drove on
404413,3295081,1,djodjo77,14/09/2023,access road prohibited to any motorized vehicle like all paths in the area... Moreover spot located ''on'' a mountain bike/pedestrian path. so-so...

404451,3225803,1,jesustamargo,27/08/2023,"Dictatorial and communist behavior on the part of the Villaviciosa city council, a nature reserve for what they want, but to enable praos of friends who own campsites and charge for it, for that there is no nature reserve, it is a shame"
404451,3177137,1,ea1abm,18/08/2023,"The same thing just happened to us, what a shame of a country, well I won't say more, another place not to return to,"
404451,3176695,1,JMGF,18/08/2023,"Confirmed with the local police, you cannot spend the night in any of the car parks on Rodiles beach as it is a nature reserve. They passed by at the end of the afternoon observing all the vehicles and with the intention of warning and/or fining. They definitely exclude us. Another place not to return."
404479,2808911,5,delaila2001,01/06/2023,"Spectacular place in the middle of nature, a rocky square that we discovered to be a helicopter landing pad. We moved them for the night and had a great time but the temperature was winter. The next morning some forest rangers came by warning that it is not possible to stop there."
404502,2833474,5,zofe,08/06/2023,"Extremely good service! Plenty of parking in the area. Spotlessly clean, simple operation via a terminal (card and cash). There are washing machines from 10kg (4,50€) to 20kg (9,-€) and large dryers (15 min. for 2,50€). Open daily from 8am to 10pm.
Table and a waiting bench are available, but it's nicer outside in the nearby park. Absolutely recommended, thanks to Xeelite for sharing this spot."
404523,3239961,5,LxsDalton,30/08/2023,"Relatively easy access for medium-sized vans, we got on and off without a problem with a high vantage point. A little traffic of cars and people who go down to the parking lot below and to the viewpoint, but very quiet and quite clean. Good views and close to the viewpoint and the old part about 10-20 minutes walk."
404523,2875357,5,Gtudor,20/06/2023,"Wonderful view, level ground and as others have said the lower lot has great sunset views and level parking. You can walk from here to the famous bridge."

404523,2787357,5,CorinnaS,26/05/2023,Really nice spot with a great view. The parking lot has 2 levels. The lower one (which is nicer and flatter) is probably difficult to get to with a mobile home. With our van it was not a problem.
404536,2692982,5,LesPoulous,24/04/2023,"Very nice location above Gorafe, the view is magnificent! It is flat but rocky. OK several vehicles. The place is quiet (two passages of bikers at the end of the afternoon and a few cars in tranquilo mode), there is an antenna 100m away (5G full pot) the track which comes from the south is in very good condition (04- 2023). The small road that comes from Gorafe is paved but narrow and steep"

404575,2766105,4,LesNoy,20/05/2023,"Atypical and rather nice place. When we came (mid May), the path was accessible even to a small car (there is one next to us) in dry weather. On the other hand, a big downside: a lot of wind. We have a roof tent and the night was very rough… no sheltered place, full wind."
404581,3174418,5,Covelar,18/08/2023,"We parked here during the day to go to the bioparc, which is a 5-minute walk away. The AC is safe because the parking lane is wide, and because the local police station is next door, cars keep coming out. Without services, but to see the bioparc it is perfect. We did not spend the night because being in a roundabout the traffic noise is continuous"
404581,3104231,2,emilioloom,08/08/2023,This is park spot on a roundabout. Ok during the day. Too noisy during evening- night. Not recommended during nights. We left to go another place. Don’t feel safe here.
404581,3035500,5,MarcoSteifen,28/07/2023,Parked here during the day to see the city. It's a good 45 minute walk into town. But the parking lot is free and is located directly at a police station and on a busy street and therefore seemed safe. I would park there again at any time to see the city.
404587,2754754,1,zaZUKowani,16/05/2023,Privat ground. Not recomend.
404598,3199241,5,NatjeThan,22/08/2023,"Very nice place, quiet and with enough shade. Perfect place to swim in the lake. The water is very clean. Pleas respect the place and take your trash with you."

thanks for this place, it was a real good time!"
404640,3167261,5,Corincita,17/08/2023,Beautiful campsite in the middle of olive trees. It is an excellent place to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of the city. It is less than an hour from Port Aventura. They have bar service. The client can use the kitchen whenever he wishes. They offer concerts and yoga classes. The staff is always attentive to the needs of the guests.
404640,2765176,5,Thetrippyhippy,19/05/2023,"Such a cool spot.
Morning yoga, open air kitchen, local beer with amazing company.

The inclination is quite notable and we found it uncomfortable for that reason. Otherwise it is highly recommended because there is no noise nor does it seem like a place where unexpected visitors are received. It has a couple of streetlights. Please do not litter or leave waste."

404872,2769448,4,Petervbm,20/05/2023,"I completely agree with the previous reviewer. If you're happy with basic amenities as a camper - then you also have the luxury of a swimming pool, bar/restaurant for a simple meal, friendly staff and an environment that lends itself perfectly to beautiful walks. The access road for campers and bus campers is easily accessible."
404872,2700576,4,Park01,27/04/2023,"Simple and natural campsite. The pitches are wide but require wedges. The sanitary facilities are clean and in good condition. At this time of year (April) maintenance work on the green areas has not yet taken place. The staff are pleasant and helpful. This campsite is recommended for nature lovers, probably less for grumpy people and Ritz lovers"
404879,2951777,4,BartNomade,11/07/2023,"We stayed in this parking lot on 3 occasions during the month of May. If you are going to park during the week, it is a good idea to leave early, as the place is full of cars, making it difficult even for larger ACs to leave. But on the 3 occasions we didn't have any problems during the night."

It is located at the edge of a road but not at all busy apart from a few hikers. There is a picnic area (tables, barbecue) a little further down with access to the river."

405029,3206731,4,oswaldo245,23/08/2023,Very natural and beautiful because there is no through traffic. Very open atmosphere and many offers of meditation are offered. Back to Nature sums it up quite well.
405029,2830342,5,BrunoLT,07/06/2023,"A truly magical place! The view is magnificent, the atmosphere is relaxing, the operators and all volunteers are warm, professional and helpful. We were very happy about the yoga lessons (special thanks to Tessa & Thaisa), a soothing massage (thanks Elina), the sauna, the fresh spring water and the luxury of an extremely well-equipped kitchen. Five stars!"
405029,2813911,5,CorinnaP.,02/06/2023,"We had a great stay at Wild Oasis. It was easy to get in touch, the pitches were perfect for our van, the bathroom was clean and the atmosphere was warm. The location overlooking the village and gorge was stunning. We were able to use the well-equipped communal kitchen. There are workshops you can take part in, but you don't have to. Highly recommended!"

405113,2799355,4,oli.mr,29/05/2023,"Large and complete campsite in terms of services, restaurant, park, gym, games room, supermarket, it has 2 swimming pools but one of them was closed for works. 2 sports areas although one of them a bit neglected. The toilets are clean but old. The plot that we got was large and level. The campsite looks a bit old and does not give the impression of being maintained."
405125,3095513,1,Siid90,07/08/2023,"Impossible in summer, everything is crowded. On the whole island there is not a shadow. Not recommended for people who like tranquility."

405133,2720278,2,Kaethenaethe,03/05/2023,"The owner tries very hard, picked me up from Hortas de Sant Joan because the place is hard to find. Unfortunately neglected, a lot of dog poo from the huge dogs. The services are not available on site but in Hortas de Sant Joan... I find that absolutely misleading. For dropouts who want to build something like this, it's definitely great. The mountain views were stunning."

405182,2750383,4,jonma,14/05/2023,"The parking lot is relatively quiet because it is close to the road, but at night there is hardly any traffic. It is a fairly well-leveled polished concrete esplanade with space for about 10 spaces (not delimited). We were able to empty grays and refill water but not empty blacks because the drain cover was closed and a special key was needed to open it."

405255,2747521,4,joselaim,14/05/2023,Good place to spend one or several nights with spectacular views. Road with little traffic. With the sound of frogs and night birds at night. Good vibes among the campers

If you are looking for a quiet place surrounded by wild nature, it is perfect!"
405327,2882281,5,ArturoVitoria,22/06/2023,"An incredible site. The picnic areas are in need of maintenance, and many are broken, but the place is spectacular. Routes and pine forests to get lost. Very good site. Drinking water."
405358,2713086,2,Naroa1985,01/05/2023,"Although there is an icon for draining water in the ad, they do not have this service at the gas station. When we asked them, they told us that if we wanted we could go to the back and empty there, but it was a field and it's not a plan... Cafeteria, toilets and little else."

405429,3059202,5,huuronzecamper,01/08/2023,"Good location for a night. We drove by and did not like the view of the dam. We drove onwards to the picnic place further west. For those not aware of Spanish law, please note the difference between parking a camper and camping with a camper. Parking for a night should be fine here unless someone can prove this is a national park."

405446,3082598,3,MC4333,05/08/2023,"Battery parking for vans and cars. About 300 meters before, next to the quarry, there is a wider and flatter area for motorhomes. We have slept very peacefully. Mobile coverage is not good."
405447,3210121,4,paulabro,24/08/2023,Beautiful and very well maintained campsite. Very clean sanitary facilities. With pool and close to the beach. The price-performance ratio is right. An advantage is that all pitches are shaded under trees.
405457,2833881,1,antosaralafurgo,08/06/2023,"Price magically raised to 10 euros for vans. I suspect this place was published by the park owner because after my comment magically any reference to the park for 1 euro disappeared from the description. Lot of free parks around, then it's your choice"

405527,3042214,5,befreitegesundheit,29/07/2023,"We replenished our water supplies there. That went quite well, drove the WoMo into the driveway opposite. There are a lot of cats on site, totally cute. A man then gave us another tip that you can also spend the night 1km further with the WoMo. Nice area here."

405590,2878315,2,Querzeltein,21/06/2023,"Great view! But that's about it. It's not a real place, but a small turning bay at the end of a street. Garbage, dog excrement and condoms are everywhere. The whole night through, cars kept coming, which probably felt disturbed by something. It was also very windy up there."
405623,3118111,1,Yadeya,10/08/2023,"It is a nice place, as you can park next to the beach, but it is quite dirty and smells bad. We had to go."

405623,2675454,1,campergirl92,16/04/2023,"Not recommendable. A special clientele meets here around the clock. Various parties with loud music at the weekend. Despite the proximity to the beach, the feel-good factor is zero."

405638,2894192,2,999i999,26/06/2023,"Very small and sloping site. It has spectacular views, but it doesn't fit a medium-sized motorhome. The road is not bad, but it is long."
405638,2668476,4,liviteasy,13/04/2023,"It's a good place, I'm not sure about the legality of staying there, I did it in April and everything was fine. There is a small path that leads to a small cape where you can watch the sunset. You can also access in 4 X 4 to the beach itself."
405640,2682662,3,park07family,20/04/2023,"Parking not that big, we found space there, but it's very busy. Not suitable for motorhomes, these are car spaces so ok only for small vans. Quite close to the city center and relatively quiet, with a children's playground nearby."
405724,3103143,5,Supermarta,08/08/2023,For a van it is perfect. Fits the creator's description. The pool bar and restaurant is great for a drink before going to sleep. and the place is very quiet
405724,2771099,2,Andjoc,21/05/2023,"1 Star as a motorhome area, on the other hand it is a dirt parking lot, no services, but near a small municipal swimming pool and a café."

405724,2678949,5,718502218,18/04/2023,The place is not bad to spend the night. Good quality food at an affordable price. Friendly treatment and serious people
405724,2674904,4,Maribelcl,16/04/2023,We only stop en route to eat and the food is good. Very good meat since it is supplied by the butcher shop of the father of the couple who runs the bar. Very good deal.

405758,2816416,4,laMilonguita,03/06/2023,"Free water, and free emptying, amazing. It hurts that because of some people who do not know how to respect it, they will surely end up paying for it, and I would see it as normal. I have seen washing the potti with the hose that the rest of us use later. It should be better signposted as some people don't know what to wait for in the waiting area and stop in the middle of the street to wait their turn."
405758,2765436,5,Noemi84,19/05/2023,Very comfortable area. Good service. I hope all users take care of it. Thanks to the town hall of La Oliva for this space. They should put more all over the island

Tried to pay twice, using both the app from the QR code on the infoboard and accessing the municipal website, but found it impossible.

Saturday night loud music till early morning and Sunday morning noisy from soccer game, other nights quiet."

It is worth 7.55 euros but the application and the web gave an error. The local police (who do it regularly) came by and told us that nothing was wrong, that they weren't looking at that. The council does it and they don't work on weekends."

406600,3100095,4,burie17770,08/08/2023,"We spent three nights in the parking lot. We are completely satisfied with this stay. Easy to get around by train to Barcelona. The only downsides are the fact that there are no large containers for waste but at the entrance to the stadium after the bus stop , there are small containers. The drain where the black water is emptied was clogged."
406600,3092305,1,famillenow,07/08/2023,"Be careful to park your vehicle in the few pitches provided for motorhomes! After a late arrival, poorly lit parking lot, we parked next to another CC in the parking lot. We tried to pay by scanning the QRcode but the app didn't work. And in the morning at 7 a.m., a fine fine of €80 for inconvenient parking, and police officers who were not at all cooperative."

406600,3049419,5,Kiril,31/07/2023,"Perfect place on my opinion. During my stay it was absolutely quiet during the nights. It takes 25 min. with the train to pl.Espanya, all services available and the most important for Barcelona - it is safe. During my stay the app and the web site did not work, so the payment was not possible."
406600,2948757,1,Calixtro,11/07/2023,"It could be an interesting place if it weren't for the late-night drinking, which seems to happen any day of the week, not just weekends, at least in summer. After a night here you take the hangover from the bottle with you the next day. I only recommend this place to change waters on the way."
406600,2933297,5,DanVrajmas,07/07/2023,"I recomand this place, is clean, is not expencive, train statiin 10 min by foot. 2.5 euros one way and also a good vilage to visit. many historical places. spend 2 nights this is maximum consecutive night tjat you are alowed to stay, the mentenace was preaty clean"
406600,2933282,3,Lorena75,07/07/2023,"The area is perfect for visiting Barcelona since the railway station that goes to the city center is 500 meters away. You pay through an app. The town hall should have better maintenance, we could not empty the sewage because it was clogged and the poop came out everywhere. To be paid they could have it clean"
406600,2928161,5,bordygeko,06/07/2023,"Camper area easily found, there are two spaces reserved for coaches while the other spaces are for campers. Convenient area to reach the metro (less than a km) to go to the center. Quiet and peaceful area.

406600,2868289,4,Elena2887,18/06/2023,"Perfect area to visit Barcelona, 600 meters from the station with frequent trains that take you to the city in 20 minutes. Stayed for 4 nights, no problems at all.Only last night between Friday and Saturday the adjoining car park was overrun by kids at 4 with loud music and shouting until 7. Cleaners passed in the morning told us Friday and Saturday is always like this."
406600,2818511,3,dima_rv,04/06/2023,"We went to fill and empty, we did not sleep there. We would not have stayed the night because there were many young people in the parking lot having a party. The police passed by several times during the afternoon."
406600,2802800,4,Sin.deentrega,30/05/2023,"perfect water loading and unloading. We have not seen the payment sign anywhere, I understand that it is no longer paid. the squares are somewhat inclined. The biggest drawback we see is that it is next to a school and a soccer field."
406600,2790689,3,jvlp23,27/05/2023,"If we are paying the least they could provide would be decent leveld spots and a better service station. Besides that, if you come on a weekend, prepare for people partying all night long. Motorhomes aren't allowed to do anything but parking, but cars don't pay and apparently are allowed to party wildly."
406600,2788590,3,xiero999,26/05/2023,"Good place. Disposal at the edge. The park app is a bit difficult, you have to be careful not to pay for 2 days if you only stay 24 hours. Go past the ruins for the railway connection. Attention, follow the blue footprints to get to the ticket machine."
406600,2769966,3,LetiMathieu,21/05/2023,Quiet place at night once the football matches are over. I find it a shame to have to pay 7.38 euros to park on concrete. Apart from the garbage cans and waste water dumps there is nothing. Payment via an application is not phew. The only good point is the metro station nearby which takes you to the center of Barcelona for 2.40 euros and about 25 minutes journey.
406600,2725203,3,PepSaig,05/05/2023,"The sign announcing ""service area for motorhomes and campers"" does not specify anything, neither free nor paid."
406600,2701716,1,AlexWinnie,27/04/2023,"This area used to be free, if the council decides to make it pay, they could bother to make some improvement. They have not even bothered to put a machine for the coins. It is not logical to have to pay to park in a public parking lot just because it is a motorhome and that 100 cars park for free in the same parking lot. Because we ALL pay the same road tax."
406600,2685352,4,MathieuLet,21/04/2023,"Good to park and go to Barcelona using the train 5 minutes away by foot but noisy between 5pm and 10pm because of the football lessons.
To pay, you must use the app but you don't have enough Internet there to download it so do it in advance or park and pay when you go somewhere with Internet."
406613,3160031,5,ares_masip,16/08/2023,Access is by track but it is very easy. We slept in high season and there was only one other van. Not too much coverage. It is the beginning of different excursions that go to some coves.
406613,3059645,4,cfalc83,01/08/2023,Passable track just a few ruts but nothing too bad.

We appreciated the pool because it was hot on our visit. Water loading/discharging area could have a more comfortable and efficient configuration for 7.5m AC like ours.

406618,2686032,4,Luftgraf,21/04/2023,"A quiet good campsite, newly renovated sanitary facilities, new small restaurant. If that's too expensive for such a good place, you should keep going. to Baba7076: that's true about the cold washing-up water. If you look hard enough, you can always find a hair in the soup. I saw that someone went around and picked up garbage that other campers left there. Paramedic was OK too."
406618,2683365,4,charlymariontour,20/04/2023,"Price for 2 adults + camper = 21€. Seats may be viewed and selected in advance. We didn't stay, so no further review possible."

City Hall with good intentions but... Of the 4 users that we were, I went to look for another area to spend the night to avoid the easy fine, since I have a Spanish license plate."
406729,2779278,5,Aloys52686,23/05/2023,What else do you want. Brand new CP. Bit bare but you are very safe and close to the edge of the Ebro. Discharge and pack water. Also empty toilet. What I do miss in Spain are toilets. Also here. You miss them in many Spanish villages. Unlike in France. 4 places (and an unloading place) are clearly indicated.

406921,2980413,4,Lealhuillery,18/07/2023,room for a van but too small for a larger motorhome. recess along a farm road next to a playground with small fountain. Quiet night no worries with the inhabitants of the surrounding closed
406922,2775895,5,Psychopinda,22/05/2023,"Nice place in a beautiful area. Room for several campers, but we were alone. Made a fantastic walk, in the company of a sweet dog from the kindergarten at the end of the 'street'. If it hadn't been so rainy, we would have stayed here for at least a few days. By the way, we had no range/3G"
406947,3262899,2,MorrisonFTransit,05/09/2023,I slept one night on 09/04/2023 and in the morning they had removed the wheel caps. The place seems quiet but at night there is not much feeling of security

No shower on the beach. After the police all ok with the van. People come back from the beach until 2 in the morning, they wash, they make noise. The machines clean the beach at night but are not as annoying as those who pass by. With children - beach!"
406950,3210077,5,angie3313,24/08/2023,Great place to spend the night. Magnificent panorama over Arouca. Toilets nearby. A little noise in the evening from the nearby bar but very quiet at night.
406953,3294642,5,Pat4Camp,14/09/2023,Perfect place to take some time out! Absolutely quiet with a great starry sky. We were left without electricity for two nights but we are somewhat self-sufficient. The showers have hot and cold running water. Toilet and washing facilities very well maintained and clean. You can also wash dishes. There is a lake in the immediate vicinity. You can go for a walk or swim there. The hosts are very friendly and accommodating. On request you can also buy delicious olive oil made by them! Thank you for an unforgettable time!
406953,3288544,5,BlackVelvet,12/09/2023,"We spent a very nice, quiet evening here. It's unbelievable how dark it is and how bright the stars shine. The place is flat, the water is running and hot. There are 2 showers and 1 composting toilet. The access is a bit bumpy, but easy to drive with our 6.40m van and 2 bicycles. Be careful if it rains, the lower area could become muddy. Many thanks to Isabell and Domenik for the opportunity to sleep in such a beautiful place."

406953,2811540,5,MarieKatrin,02/06/2023,"Incredible view on the lake, calm place and superfriendly hosts. You can go hiking, fishing, kayaking or just for a swim directly next to the site. New facilities, which are built in an interesting way. The access road is a bit bumpy, but we managed to get there with our ""normal"" car without any problems. Definitely worth the ride! Had a very good sleep there for two nights."
406953,2768431,5,mariontieman,20/05/2023,"If you like peace and quiet and are looking for a rustic place, this is the place for you. The dwarf eagle flies above the lake here and in the background you can hear the bells of the sheep. The access road is quite a challenge, but it can even be done with a 7-meter camper. The shower is hot and there is a compost toilet, no electricity but no problem for us. We think it's a top spot."
406953,2740263,5,sweddi,10/05/2023,"Beautifully situated in the middle of nature at the lake where we were swimming. Ideal for watching animals. Very nice and accommodating host, good showers! Getting there on the dirt road is a bit demanding but ok if you take your time. We'd love to come back!"

Very little water comes out for 1€/5minutes. We invested the 1€ and didn't even manage to get 10 liters out. That's how you can make money..... we drove 200 meters further to the Repsol gas station. Free and works. I'd rather have Repsol.

Therefore, the parking lot is only recommended for during the day."

We agree with the owner of the land and the poor man is tired of being stepped on in his field (especially when he has not yet collected the wheat). Very quiet night, road with little traffic and a very beautiful view of the mallos de riglos."
407993,2849322,5,Guibolle31,13/06/2023,Very quiet location even if it is located just on the side of the road (road not busy at night). superb view of the Mallos. Be careful not to park at the entrance to the private fields (passage in the early morning of an owner) but stay in the free zone just before the fields.

Not accessible when it rains.. (accessible for vans and 4x4s.) and on the way back, it skates a little, rolling well on the stones. (Pick up cigarette butts, beer capsules, toilet paper).

Although they do not empty gray or black water, in the town of Roquetes (15 minutes away) there is a caravan area where we were able to empty it for free. Ana, we will be back, thank you very much for everything!"
408476,2780199,5,GwBrX,23/05/2023,Very warm welcome from Anne on reception. Very interesting to obtain the explanation of its trout farm. The horses and sheep roam freely but do not disturb at all. Camping without luxury. A beautiful beautiful location with a toilet.
408476,2773626,5,Estartit,21/05/2023,"Unbeatable environment, we were welcomed by Anna and we felt at home. Very basic site but with enormous possibilities. Emptying of blacks and grays impossible. Keep in mind that it is in a Natural Park. We caught some trout €12/kg. we cooked them in the oven advised by Anna (impressive). We'll be coming back. Thank you Anna"
408476,2745266,5,Barto87,13/05/2023,"We were very comfortable and calm, which was what we were looking for with a little girl. Although they have sheep and horses, we were able to go with our dog, although they kindly asked us to make sure he didn't disturb the animals. They have toys for children and a very fun animal mini golf. Thanks for everything!"
408476,2728564,5,JonasSchleuning,06/05/2023,"Super nice, lonely fish farm in the middle of the mountains. Were greeted right at the beginning by a dog, a cat, a pony, a horse and several sheep. (free running during the day) Anna then showed us our pitch and the fish farm. If you want, you can then fish your own dinner and prepare it on the BBQ. (for a fair price) Thanks for the nice stay! :)"

The staff is super friendly. Thank you!"
408479,3181332,4,iga93,19/08/2023,"A spectacular and quiet place. At dusk there are mosquitoes (unavoidable in the case of a rice field), but taking measures and being careful is bearable. The site is very clean and fairly level. We would repeat without a doubt."
408479,2924433,1,Benz_5,04/07/2023,"undeniably, the spot is cool during the day! But once the sun goes down, then clouds of mosquitoes come out of the rice fields (4th of July). Having anticipated, however, everything was closed, candles and mosquito nets on the roof window.... We found ourselves fleeing the spot at 10:30 p.m., in panic, covered in mosquitoes which returned despite everything (a real mystery)!!! frightening"

409304,3226410,5,Primpiratas,27/08/2023,"Parking located at the entrance of the town, even without services, 2 picnic tables. The train is heard but it has not bothered us. Very quiet night. We have been very satisfaced. Ideal for touring the turns, and parking comfortably without having to enter the town. In town there is a teleclub bar (I don't know the schedule)."

409317,3290465,4,wachimagia,12/09/2023,"Rosa and Pepe welcomed us with a lot of love and dedication. The tortilla, the wine and the tomatoes, spectacular. The parking area was their property, a little inclined, but we had a super quiet night. The last 10km of the road are narrow but we passed without problem with a large ac. We recommend not going during the week to avoid crossing trucks. Thank you very much, great experience!!"
409317,3187063,5,Carmenvw,20/08/2023,"A wonderful place. A quiet, authentic place in the heart of the Ribeira Sacra. Being able to dine as we did, accompanied by Rosa and Jose, at home, that wonderful food and wine, and on top of that, sleep on the same farm in absolute silence and with fresh air. An unexpected luxury. Much more than an overnight area. To repeat a thousand times."
409317,3182656,5,Rosa74,19/08/2023,"A nice experience. Rosa and Pepe took great care of us. We tried some 100% homemade dishes with ingredients from their own harvest: tomatoes from the garden, chicken eggs and sausages made by themselves. All accompanied by their wine and homemade liquors. Then we slept in his farm very peacefully. Call before you go. You won't regret it."
409317,3148427,5,Marie7894,14/08/2023,"Exactly what you are looking for when you go to the farm: (very) good products, welcoming hosts, toilets and flat land, superb! Plan cash if you want to pay the first bank is 20min by car"
409317,3096357,5,spschaki91,07/08/2023,The place is a bit isolated but 5 minutes away from a beautiful Mirador. The manager of the house personally accompanied us to the Mirador. Attention: the streets to the Mirador are narrow. The sleeping place is flat. We could eat and drink with the whole family and taste delicious wine. Food was homemade and very tasty. Knowledge of Spanish would be an advantage.
409317,2708515,5,Gasofas,30/04/2023,"Old and award-winning winery converted in Furancho. The Plot is inclined, but has flat areas. We went to dinner and slept there. Not a single noise all night. Midweek by reservation only. weekends from 5:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. Call Rosa first"

The ‼️ problem is the slope that you have to drive up to get back on the street - I have a Volkswagen T3 and it took me two tries to get back up there, it is quiet steep and curvy!! So before you go down, take a look at the street first!!"
409430,3286705,5,GregMillon,11/09/2023,"We took the small path leading south. It is certainly narrow and among the branches but then there is a lonely spot where you can park. Only one place on the other hand, but what a place!"

Your hidden in the bushes and in quite a beautiful forest. But now and then cars and trucks pass by creating that highway like noice"
409531,2994739,4,lidi_ss,20/07/2023,"Good place to stop, if you catch the little shade there is, and take the path that runs through the coves, it's worth it for the views and taking a bath in one of them. Few parking spaces."

410613,3175189,5,lgprats,18/08/2023,"Very quiet night, locals walk their dogs here but it's not a bother. It is advisable to try the ""coca de recapte"" (onion and pepper) in a bakery and buy their extra virgin olive oil. we will be back"
410640,3060316,2,galevinc,01/08/2023,"perfect for parking and visiting during the day, provided you arrive early, because at 9 a.m. the street was already full. I don't recommend this car park at all for spending the night, it's close to a club with music until 4:30, and on a very busy road, it was almost impossible to sleep."
410640,2997900,4,novemberlilli,21/07/2023,During the day we parked a bit further ahead at the bus stop. Great for a city visit! Parking is right by the park and fairly central to the city. Everything within walking distance.
410640,2978259,3,sajba14,17/07/2023,Good for walking around city centre but I wouldn’t recommend it for night stays because it is on the main road.
410640,2854665,4,MOBB,14/06/2023,"We were unsure at first because there aren't many comments on this entry yet, but we found a great parking spot here. With a bit of luck, you can find large gaps along the road and we made a great fit with our 6.5, but just to be on the safe side, we drove onto the curb with the inner tires so as not to cross the line. There don't seem to be any illegal park rangers here either and the location right next to the park is great for a picnic, for example. You can walk to the city in about 30 minutes and pass several sights such as the Placa d'Espania. The only downside is the street noise, which was bad in the mornings on weekdays, but of course we were aware of that beforehand."
410645,2721142,4,OndrejNovotny,04/05/2023,"Low light level for parking in the city (only two lamps behind tree). Calm and quiet. At our stay some local driver came around 6:30 to turn his car (turning not possible at the connected road) so we left the place.
3minutes ride from beach.
Steep and small access road, not suitable for big vans."

410809,3082997,4,emilioloom,05/08/2023,Extremely noisy in early mornings. Close to a shopping centre and a nice pizzeria. 40 min walking to Alhambra. In summer the trees can help with a nice shade in the mornings. Useful for large motorhomes.

I agree with other opinions, the road to get there is complicated, the last 200-300 meters are a track with a lot of gravel that made the motorhome skid. It is a pity that in a town they spend money in an area that is not accessible..."
411139,2801070,1,Lupivan,29/05/2023,"Too bad, but the area is not accessible, if you don't want to leave the ground, the electric step, or the overhang at the entrance."

It is just a little dead end street with some residential homes in the area though so be respectful.  We parked our rig here and caught Ubers into Porto (about 15 min and 6 euro).  Good shopping nearby too although be aware there are no services

As a drawback the constant coming and going of cars and in the summer you can hear the people in the building in front talking when they are on the balconies, I went there for work and it was a bit annoying, during the week vehicles from the estate just below . Thanks anyway!"

The site is paid, when I went to the toilets I saw a sign explaining how to pay for the Osona Territori Camper app €3.

411336,3044023,4,Mimouche,30/07/2023,Campervan area nice and well located for visiting the city. Indeed a marching band rehearsed in the area in the morning but it was nice and above all I think exceptional because we spent 2 nights there and it only happened once... Lacks a little shade. otherwise the nice circuit in the area is to take the boat to Pinhao and return by train to the station located just next door!
411336,3032742,3,Morganla,28/07/2023,"Nice car park air but that's not counting the stray dogs that walk around at night and fight between vans and motorhomes, as well as an 8 a.m. wake-up call by a brass band concert not far away...."

I highly recommend !"

Easy walk along river to town for boat trips and wine tasting, also train station for trips further afield. You can use emptying/filling services at the aire higher up. There was a little noise from traffic on the bridge above in the early morning and again barking dogs were annoying, but would definitely return here."

Van with bread and pastries at the door daily, etc. Recommended 120%"

411344,3165949,5,heiditxu,17/08/2023,A charming place and like a staff of 10. The toilets are always clean and the showers are not push-button so you can regulate the temperature perfectly. It has a river area (unpolluted) with a place to have a drink and across a bridge a grove with elastic boxes and games. The visit to the farm highly recommended. Take the family we have enjoyed a lot.
411344,3121647,5,LvdD,11/08/2023,"Fantastic place with incredibly friendly staff who do everything they can to make your stay a pleasant one. A good base to visit everything.

It should be said that the price of 35 euros for a small pitch for a caravan for two people (28 euros as a base plus 7 per additional person) is excessive. The same for 30 euros would deserve up to six stars."
411344,2918361,5,RUBEST,03/07/2023,"fantastic place! Two adults, a girl and a baby spent the night with the van for €20. The bathrooms are impeccable and the staff is super friendly, we recommend it!!"

Difficult to access I think for vans and motorhomes, otherwise the view is beautiful and the spot is pleasant, possibility of swimming."

We couldn't spend the night here, the branches of the trees on the dirt road were very overgrown and our motorhome, 3 meters high by 6 meters long, wouldn't fit. The ground was very uneven. Difficult to turn around, we had to back out. Recommended for smaller vehicles."

Only negative point for my taste: the vehicles drive fast on this small road, especially the locals who drive by. Beware of those with young children. The city is good but nothing more."
411890,3091678,3,alexcarri07,07/08/2023,"Great place, we stayed for two days and a bit surprised by all the comments that it was saturated, since we spent the night as 3/4 campers at most and separated by 100m. ⚠️ 3 stars because the next morning we found a nail in the wheel, which we surely stepped on when parking. I'll leave it here, in case it happened to someone else, or in case it wasn't such a coincidence."

411960,3244801,5,jhuls11,01/09/2023,Perfect place. No noise except the river. Nothing busy at night. Wonderful awakening. Access a little limited. NOT SUITABLE for vehicles larger than a van.
411960,3239003,4,LindatravelsEU,30/08/2023,"Good place for the night. Police is coming often. Camping is not allowed, sleeping in the car is fine. Took photos of the cars’ plate numbers, in case of rubish - penalty would be issued."
411960,3200214,4,anmi123,22/08/2023,"We stood here a couple of nights. You can hear the highway in the distance, but it's still quiet and you could refresh yourself in the river. The local police kindly warned us that camping chairs are not allowed. However, the second time you would receive a penalty. We cleared the chairs straight away and the police left."
411960,3135655,5,HjalmarDE,13/08/2023,"Chill spot, with large spaces and calm environment ☺️"
411960,3120529,5,cragajo,11/08/2023,"Wonderful place to wake up! We entered the forest path (Camp Roig as it says on the map) and we arrived without a problem. In total we sleep 5-6 campers comfortably. Shortly after arriving, the local police appeared and only warned us that we could stay the night, but not camp (it gave us the feeling that they had already stopped by to notify the rest of the people). Super recommended!"
411960,3111089,5,MiesOpReis,09/08/2023,"Fantastic! Indeed not an easy access road but worth it! The police also came to us after sunset to tell us to move our chairs inside, but they were friendly. We were there mid-August and were with 2 campers."
411960,3080574,5,Guiteverest,05/08/2023,"Very nice spot. Very quiet night with the sound of water in the background. We are not allowed to camp, so we are not allowed to take out chairs and tables. But nevertheless Guardia Civil very nice."
411960,3080519,5,Pallares18,05/08/2023,"There are two or three access roads. We have spent one night without problem. At night the police came by and told us that it was allowed to spend the night but NOT to camp. So it is not possible to take out tables, chairs... please keep the place clean."
411960,3038341,5,ShVerh,29/07/2023,"A tip don't drive in the dark nice job. Beautiful place quiet. Had a good night's sleep. The sound of running water, frogs and crickets is simply amazing!"
411960,2997282,2,Tonythuliez,21/07/2023,We had to turn around because access with a long motorhome (7m10) on 3m10 high very very complicated it's a shame
411960,2888271,5,ryangsy,24/06/2023,"We were a little concerned at first driving off a road next to a very large industrial estate into what looked like a very steep field entrance, but we were brave, and this paid off, a narrow path for some time but opened out into a beautiful Riverside spot!"
411960,2872391,5,CYRRA,19/06/2023,"We went through the canal road in a van, no difficulty. watch out for the bigger size. Quiet, pleasant place, very little traffic, a few walkers. Very calm night."
411960,2807981,4,CKONE,01/06/2023,Great spot for one night. Located right on the river. Nice atmosphere. One star deduction because you can hear the nearby highway a bit.
411960,2804044,5,LeoSimeon,30/05/2023,"A super corner, quiet with a very nice view, both wild and comfortable (flat ground, gravel) and around water, grass, trees, the top"
411960,2797692,5,malotrusss,29/05/2023,"Super quiet spot with little sound of river and birds! I recommend, calm guaranteed, very isolated and a little complicated to access with a large vehicle, but the result is worth it!!"
411960,2794825,2,YohoVAN,28/05/2023,We have tried to arrive and by the fluvial road impossible since it is very narrow. We have not been able to find the path through the forest.
411960,2777647,4,julien59880,23/05/2023,"you shouldn't be afraid to venture out, but the trip is very good! via Google Map it goes through the rain channel (ok in dry weather) otherwise the path in the forest is perfect. a little noise from the highway in the background but not bothersome, very quiet at night."
411960,2775056,5,Waba_van,22/05/2023,"beautiful and quiet place in the middle of nature, visited during the day by locals. 
you have 2 ways to get there, one is a weird road next of a rain channel... don't worry you will reach the spot!"
411960,2774999,5,dada1500,22/05/2023,"Great place, no passage and view of the river! Place for several vans."
411960,2759952,5,morganeeer,18/05/2023,"Very quiet, clean, plenty of room. Do not be afraid to sink to find the place."
411960,2757817,5,viktoris,17/05/2023,"wonderful place, near girona. Both driveways are perfect for multivans, access via the canal is probably a bit too narrow for larger vehicles.. very sunny! Please take your rubbish with you, this should remain a clean place. possibility for picnic"
412015,3040790,5,refers110,29/07/2023,Super spot to fill up drinking water and solar shower.
412091,3004702,3,nayarai,23/07/2023,"It is a fountain in the middle of the maritime pass. Impossible to fit a vehicle, whatever its size. A trickle comes out that can make a little fix to fill a carafe, but nothing more. At the exit of Armaçao towards Alcantarilla there are two campsites and AC areas that will be more useful for filling/emptying"
412098,3013536,5,Loandkik,24/07/2023,Indeed gas bottles 904 and 907. Thank you

412183,3258638,4,IsaPatist,04/09/2023,"Entrance is a bit dubious because you seem to go through a private gate. Continue here to the end of the paved path. Still a sandy climb to the beach. But quiet at night and some shade between the coniferous trees. Are building next to the road, of which limited nuisance."
412183,3255730,4,LucieGenet,03/09/2023,"We parked a little before this ""place"" on the left side of the road. A slight sandy slope next to the road. So we weren't crowded with all the other vans on the square further away. Visit from the fox, he didn't stay when he realized he wouldn't have anything to eat. Nice night in the middle of the forest. I recommend our place."
412183,3228213,5,AnnaBel35,27/08/2023,"Great place in the middle of nature, the beach is 10 min walk. No services. Didn't see any foxes, maybe because the neighbors had dogs. Very calm, we are at the top!"
412183,3148266,1,Alpha01,14/08/2023,"Actually no parking lot but only a larger turning point where cars and vans can park. Outside of the pavement due to the sandy soil actually no parking. Unsuitable for vehicles larger than panel vans, so one star from me. But it is beautiful in nature."
412183,3121124,4,happycamper18,11/08/2023,"Super place in the middle of the forest on a cobbled road (a bit strange but belongs to a resort next door). Quite further and strenuous way to the beach - but it's worth it! ATTENTION: there are one or more foxes without fear of humans. Please don't leave rubbish under the car etc., that attracts them even more and they tear up the rubbish bags."
412183,3104250,5,sarahdly,08/08/2023,Quiet spot at the end of a paved road (a little strange but it belongs to a resort next door and there is no problem crossing it). Many other vans but possibility to put a little further along the road. The beach at the end is beautiful! A beautiful feeling of being alone in the world :)
412183,3072312,4,rachaelmharri,04/08/2023,"We drove down, maybe 8-10other vans there bit absolutely no data coverage. We need this for work so unfortunately had to leave."
412183,3072281,5,astridtherisod,03/08/2023,Very small but nice parking! Gorgeous 15 minute walk to the beach. Very quiet at night
412183,3011670,5,parkoamelo,24/07/2023,Very cute spot. Had some other campers around and the beach was very pretty.
412183,3009432,4,davsar69,23/07/2023,"Great place, where we spent the night. Near the path to the beautiful beach (ocher cliffs). Quite a lot of passage at night (cars, 4x4, motocross) but no trouble or problem. There were 3 other vans parked there. A note: a fox was prowling nicely around... beware of food pilfering ;-) Quite surprising access, via the gate of a luxury residence under construction"
412183,3006125,4,jyepes1,23/07/2023,"of all the 3 parking places, this is your best option if you have a small/medium car. (Don't test the sands! we saw a car being towed) it's only parking, no services here or at the beach , which is great"
412183,2999775,5,juliedemars,21/07/2023,"Great spot in a very calm and safe place, 15 min walk from the beach with a breathtaking view of the sunset. We were 6 vans to spend the night there."
412183,2994420,4,ediandfrido,20/07/2023,"Pretty secluded and calm place. The entrance is shared with what looks like a private resort currently being built, just follow the road until you reach the end. Not a lot of space to park (5/6 cars). The beach is a bit far from the paved road (15min) but it is REALLY worth the walk. Locals come during the day to go to it, and a few campers stay on the night. Not for huge campers."
412183,2955118,5,zerodfault,12/07/2023,"Arrived here a while ago and there’s no one else here. There is construction nearby but they are very quiet. They told me that caravans have been parking here in the past days and there is no problem. Also, the police came and said caravans could park here. No problem. (Didn’t ask about staying the night though). The beach is amazing but a good 15 minutes on foot. Might stay more than one night."
412183,2953835,4,L4urett4,12/07/2023,Quiet roundabout parking space in the forest. The approach through a supposed gate can be completed without problems. The place is paved and straight. Currently construction site with earthworks but these will not start until around 8:00 a.m. No problem. Access to the sea can be reached in 15 minutes on foot.
412183,2952953,4,kwpark,12/07/2023,We stayed here for a night in our van along with 5 other vans and a motor home. It was next to a construction work zone so the next morning a machine was going by 8am. Our only issue was that the area stank of sewerage.
412183,2939294,4,greglaurent62@gmail.com,08/07/2023,"Parking spaces are possible in what looks like a turnaround. Everyone plays the game and several people can park without any problem. Very calm, without prohibition. Stunning beach 15 mins walk in sand, good climb so a bit of fitness is needed but worth the cost."
412183,2936596,5,BartandKlaudia,08/07/2023,Beautiful parking spot in the middle of the forest. Very easy to get with a campervan. Beach is only 10 mins walk away with beautiful views. We stayed there one night with other campers and loved it. Felt very safe
412183,2923103,5,PocoMaster,04/07/2023,"Quiet place, 10m walk from the beach and with room for about 4 vehicles. At night security guards pass through the area but they have no problem with the campers."

412183,2904266,5,dronogro,29/06/2023,"Nice peaceful place, beach is 15minutes away walking. There was a fox going around in the night, and it took our shoes. We found them in the morning in the woods below the parking space :). Also, this place looks like private property - when coming you pass a huge gate, and you can see that it can be closed. Security comes around every once and awhile,  doesn’t say anything to campers."
412183,2879193,5,DanVrajmas,22/06/2023,Totaly recoanding this place. Very very quiet and isolated area had no problems with parking a 7.5m carava. the road 8s pretty nice. And time at time the park quard is visiting. staid 3 nights
412183,2826114,5,michellesancho,06/06/2023,Great spot for sleep. 6 spots van maximum. 15 minutes walk to the beach.

412216,2736524,4,pasandvan,09/05/2023,Quick wash and dry. Pleasant atmosphere. Large parking lot next door with low price gas station and supermarkets.
412219,2943718,1,Manouk93,09/07/2023,Very bad place to stay.  One night Police came and sended everybody away. Sometimes smelly because of the trashbins and sewage-cleaning station next to it. At least it had some shadows during the morning
412219,2778068,3,jana12345,23/05/2023,"If you don't mind the very busy road and the many people who take away their garbage here, the place is fine."
412238,2737149,3,Roel964,09/05/2023,The starting point of two walking routes is about 200 meters towards Llinars. Route #7 Camí de la Moixa (1h17 - 4.4km - easy) en route #8 Camí del Clot Fité (3h47 - 10.8km - difficult).
412248,3124593,1,xeniaGM,11/08/2023,"Full of ants, we don't even know where they came from, a real plague. And look, we put a protector around the van... and not even that. As if that weren't enough, they robbed us, the kitchen window was open a couple of fingers to ventilate, we went for a walk and around the corner it was broken. Luckily we hadn't left anything of value..."
412248,3058152,4,HugoLuque,01/08/2023,"We slept there with a camper car, it was fine. There is a campsite next to it and a little music was heard, but nothing annoying. We were 3/4 more vans. There are many ants, they entered our car leaving 2 fingers open windows."
412248,3045412,5,AtuBeraViajera,30/07/2023,"Very good place, quiet both to sleep and to park in the shade of the pines. 10 min walk from the beach along a path through the pine forest."
412248,2973832,4,SpelaS,16/07/2023,"We slept there with some other campers. It was peaceful, nice and shady. Good spot. I would recommend. About 15 min walk to the beach."
412319,3235610,4,Serut,29/08/2023,"Use Google maps to get there. Waze asked me to cross the lake which I didn't, and it took me 30 min to finally get there. Look carefully at your map before starting the path to favor a straight path, because the GPS can put you on the paths too early which is a waste of time. Otherwise very calm indeed"
412325,3217889,5,Mazacolt,25/08/2023,"Site of 10! One of the few places where we have been where the people are not pigs. Very clean, with a family atmosphere on sunny days. We slept almost alone, one more Camper stayed. Level ground. There is no garbage, but a few km away there are villages with containers. Keep it clean!"
412325,2769366,5,MartaBC,20/05/2023,"Perfect place to spend the night, quiet. Ideal if you travel with dogs, there is a river where you can bathe without problem, it has no lighting or services, but it is really worth it."
412325,2765657,5,fannmx,19/05/2023,"A good place to spend the night, in the morning we took a bath in the river and had a great time. The only thing is that there is no water or toilets, but it is really beautiful."

412426,3277489,5,Marinja,09/09/2023,very quiet place with fabulous views
412426,3273497,5,MiguelGaultier,08/09/2023,"The site is fabulous and the views of the beach are incredible. It is a quiet place and there is a little shop right in front that provides the basic needs, as well as a little further up the pensioners' club where you can eat very, very well and in quantity. The only bad thing is access to the esplanade, which has a distance from the curb, but with care and care it can be overcome."
412426,3174447,5,pilberper,18/08/2023,Very good site. We spent 2 nights with our van and we were very calm accompanied by 8/10 more vans/ac. We slept with the gate window open and the air was running. Good views in the morning and you have some beautiful coves next to it. The police did not come by to say anything. 100% recommended
412426,3164858,5,pitufaT5,17/08/2023,"Very quiet place with beautiful views of the port. A joy to wake up with those views and that tranquility, highly recommended. 3rd-age restaurant next door with ridiculous prices. Very top place the truth"
412426,2897966,5,nicolas2023,27/06/2023,"A spectacular place that is essential to eat at La Ola restaurant on the terrace, one of the best fried pieces in Almería and a surprising ridiculous price for the location and the perfect quality at night and excellent views"
412460,3160371,5,Soraya_vv,16/08/2023,"When we arrived we had a warm welcome. We we're the only ones there and could choose a nice spot in the wide open field, where we had a nice view. This place is definately recommended!"
412469,2744831,3,SlowWorldTravel,12/05/2023,"Tha pad is small, and you can only turn your car at this spot. We drove further though some small streams, only possible with a 4x4. Had to turn on the small grass next to the road. Because the small stream had washed away the road, not possible to cross, even not by 4x4. So don't drive further ;) we spend the night. You can here the high way, so you are in the first, it is not remote enough."
412471,3283008,5,Cadarticho,11/09/2023,"Excellent welcome, very friendly from the owner. Flat land among the trees. Excellent !"
412471,3275992,5,jrsportugal,09/09/2023,Excellent place to rest. Nature in its pure state. The owner was very helpfull.
412471,3192205,5,GustavoRego,21/08/2023,"Hello, we are traveling and we spent a late night in the place. The land is being conditioned and the owner let us spend the night anyway and has not charged us. The site is completely natural surrounded by trees, there is an adjoining field planted with corn It is really quiet and pleasant. In the morning you can hear the birds singing and the temperature for August is very comfortable."
412471,3165856,5,y1,17/08/2023,"Beautiful wild piece of land, spent two nights here in the nature. You have shade from the trees, you hear the birds, me and my dog loved it. Thanks!"

412471,2778407,5,JBPG,23/05/2023,"Quiet location, centered in nature. Note that it is still under development, but a few more amenities will be welcome. The floor is still a bit rough, it can be seen that it was recently deforested, it is not possible to walk barefoot for now. The friendliness of the owner and the oranges for breakfast should be highlighted. I liked the space and will come back here to follow the development. Thank you very much!"
412471,2775084,5,Serronruin,22/05/2023,"Good morning @Coshpark, I am very sorry for what happened and any inconvenience caused.  I started on this platform a few days ago and had not realized that my contact was not available.  I heard about the situation from the neighbor of the property who explained the situation.  I hope you come back and enjoy this space. Kind Regards, Serronruin"
412471,2769824,1,coshpark,21/05/2023,"We come from there. Awful road, just passable with our van. We finally arrive at a large closed metal gate. Impossible to do 1/2 turn. Reverse almost impossible. I honked for a long time. A guy arrives on a quad. He only spoke Portuguese. Showed him the Park4night page and photos. He looked completely and sincerely surprised. A joke ???? Grrrr"
412471,2741263,5,Rititi,11/05/2023,"My family and I love it, a space inserted in nature, close to the city of Porto and the beaches of Povoa do Varzim. The very friendly owner offered us some sweet organic oranges. For nature lovers, diversity of trees, no luxuries but perfect for us. We will be back without a doubt."
412499,3266887,4,juan71,06/09/2023,Place next to the road but friendly. Hacinas is a town that has the Fossil Tree Museum worth seeing. The surroundings can be discovered with hiking and mountain bike routes.
412582,3202218,5,Chikenito,22/08/2023,"Exceptional view, very quiet and isolated place. Young people passed around midnight to listen to music nearby, they only stayed around fifteen minutes (maybe the lighthouse shift). Trash can next to it. Minibuses of tourists pass by to look at the splendid view from 10 a.m. Presence of seagulls, but they seem broken because they make unusual cries."
412582,3135232,5,alexisetlea,13/08/2023,"Really nice view, no one pass on the road during the night. Don’t be affraid by the song of the famous sea birds ! We were parked before an other car come to sleep too. Enought place, really quiet, and awsome view the night and at the sunset !"

We did not spot the sunset but it was a very good location to stay."

412621,3047959,5,walf,30/07/2023,Possibility of climbing the small paved path (VAN) to go to the entrance of the old campsite. Sheltered from the wind without extravagant views. Also to spend the night.
412621,2988865,5,Sandrillon974,19/07/2023,"top view! in the middle of the mountain and the fir trees! we spent one night there on a Wednesday, alone in the world! small walks possible just next door (GR 14 passage). We recommend this spot for lovers of nature and views."
412621,2854864,5,Maaver,14/06/2023,"Awesome spot, one of the most beautiful views over the Douro I’ve seen. Camped here for 2 nights, all alone. You hear the bell of the church, but it stops during the night. A bit higher up is another viewpoint, great for picknicks. Would def recommend!!"
412661,3146585,5,doly64,14/08/2023,"Great place and great hospitality. We struggled to find but it was worth the stubbornness! Change of scenery guaranteed. We were even treated to cherry tomatoes from the garden as an aperitif as an arrival gift...adorable. We even bought them onions, eggplants and tomatoes from their garden which were excellent"
412661,3080841,5,Havernomads,05/08/2023,"Very warm, hospitable and friendly owners who recently opened their doors for motorhomes. We spend 2 nights and felt very welcome. Two adorable dogs and drinking water available. We also bought some fresh vegetable from their own garden. Highly recommend!!"
412661,3001166,4,florianmoelle,22/07/2023,We came for one night and stayed five. Luis and Ana showed us a kindness and helpfulness that we did not expect. The place is still under construction and offers a lot of free space. The town of São Cristóvão is 10-15 minutes away and offers the opportunity to shop and eat out. Strangers became friends we will see again.
412661,2852710,5,DelphineGh,14/06/2023,"We spent one night in this place and we were very well received with great advice, thank you very much because it's always a pleasure during a roadtrip! If you need peace and nature 500m from the village, this is the ideal place. No shower or toilet for the moment but water service and emptying of gray water. Safe place too. We recommend!"
412661,2810016,5,Balden67,01/06/2023,"Hello, Quiet place and warm and friendly welcome, large spaces. we enjoyed our stay. Important: if you are guided by GPS take the N253 road then towards the town of Sao Chistovão and then the path to the property, there is a path through fields on the opposite side but to be avoided."
412661,2783952,5,JanoOooo,25/05/2023,The hostess was very nice and gave us a warm welcome. We were able to choose a spot in a large pasture near the sheep. Google maps directed us to the back end of the property. You only have to drive around the property once and make yourself known at the entrance. We were very satisfied and spent a pleasant night!
412661,2781306,5,NorvilleRogers,24/05/2023,A quiet pitch in nature. On a sheep pasture. Silence and a beautiful view of the landscape. Didn't use any services and only stayed one night but enjoyed it.
412661,2775450,5,Karstbrum,22/05/2023,"Would recommend!

A spacious and calm place in a rural area with some olive and cork trees. There are sheep and two lovely young dogs. Buildings at the entrance will be renovated. 

The owners are friendly and welcoming. They let you mind your own business but also gave us some nice recommendations for the rest of our trip. 

Don't forget to visit the bakery in the village between 19:30 and 20:30"

412703,3108690,5,Dufrier,09/08/2023,"What a joy this place !!! It's a small corner of nature's paradise where time has no place. The installations are simple but largely sufficient. Barbara offers some space but also unusual and atypical accommodation. However, pay attention to the size. Access is more suitable for vans and lighter builds. We were in a converted pickup, the big motorhomes will not pass. Thank you Barbara."
412703,2924743,5,Mic_hiel,05/07/2023,"A beautiful paradise in the middle of nature. The road to it is easy to do if you drive slowly. Once you arrive you can immerse yourself in the absolute peace and beauty of the landscape. Barbara also provides meals upon request. The starry sky is beautiful. Please note, currently electricity is only available during the day."
412710,2761261,5,mariohs,18/05/2023,"I recommend it 100x100, after drying it retains the smell of washing and the freshness of the fabric softener. You can park in front, Repsol gas station next door and a bar where you can have a drink while washing clothes, the walls are also close."

THANK YOU."
412780,3236331,5,Tucacamper,29/08/2023,"Very new area, ideal for getting to know the council. It is very close to a gas station and the town has all the services. There are options to eat nearby such as a burger ""Mas que tratos"" with delicious burgers that are worth trying either at the premises or ordering to enjoy in the little house with wheels ;))"
412780,3233941,5,Jankarlomore20,29/08/2023,Good area to get to know the area. There is a hamburger restaurant nearby (Mas que Trastos) highly recommended. They have home service
412780,3143951,4,Avilacan,14/08/2023,Spectacular. Big and quiet. It is worth the detour. Town with all the services. Good job from this council. We have spent one night.

There's a railway track nearby, but hardly any trains pass by. The town is surrounded by stunning mountains.

Thank you to the Ayuntamiento for giving us these facilities."

412973,2905035,5,Tschudie,29/06/2023,Great place to get water. But with a push button. parking spaces in front. It was ideal for us.
412987,2829490,5,Mabli59,07/06/2023,"This place has a fantastic view, best seen at sunset and plenty of flat space to park up. BUT if you approach from Beas de Guadix the road is incredibly narrow and steep with no option to turn around. It felt difficult even in my small 4.8 metre van. Better accessed from Paulenca, a dirt road but much flatter and OK even after some wet weather. This is the direction I drove out."
412988,2744751,4,senzacap22,12/05/2023,"Nice view, convenient staircase to go down to the beach, no service. They sent us away as soon as the sun went down even though we were only parked."

413062,2943057,4,Slybz,09/07/2023,"Parked flat shortly before the hill, I preferred not to climb it. As it is difficult to find a spot around Lisbon, this one will do very well for 1 night or 2. Thanks for sharing."
413062,2752431,5,r.schmer,15/05/2023,"The last climb of the approach is a bit off-road, higher ground clearance and good tires should be available, as well as some courage :D You can stand pretty flat at the spot itself and the surroundings are wonderfully quiet."
413081,3156634,5,javipirriky,16/08/2023,"Quiet place to sleep, the first day alone. The next day a couple of caravans more. To go down, it is done from the path above, in front of the bus stop that also has parking. please take care of the environment"
413081,2916880,3,Frangomezoria,02/07/2023,"Very good place, without services but an incomparable setting, beautiful bike lane, the Pas river to bathe with its dam and jump salmon, fishermen's path, gastronomic offer for different budgets, rock art interpretation center with impressive caves and almost infinite bike lane So you connect with others."

The machines worked fine and clear instructions are on the wall. It says it has wifi, but it didn't work. It has only 1 plug, the one on the TV that was turned off). It also has a clothes folding table. Next door is a bar."

413173,2746646,5,HannesBehrendt,13/05/2023,efficient and fairly cheap. washed and dried 2 loads of laundry in 1h. dryers are very strong! we dried almost 30kg in 30 min. definitely recommend!
413208,3087965,4,jveram,06/08/2023,"magnificent esplanade. We only stopped to eat, but it is also a perfect place to spend the night. Lots of space and quite level. Keep the environment clean and keep an eye on the cows."
413208,2867555,5,Miranda1,18/06/2023,"great place, wonderfully quiet. enough shade from trees. very occasionally a passing car or motorcycle. Enough space for more than 4 campers. On the other side there is a source to fill your water tank. Great chance of spotting animals, unfortunately we did not see them and were with 2 others."
413216,3279192,5,pastenague,10/09/2023,"But what a view from up there! The spot between two pine trees is great! We were there during the harvest, the place is calm and very pleasant!"

413338,3180105,1,albertcodesal,19/08/2023,"A pity that they have forbidden to spend the night. It was a good place to sleep and spend the day. As always, the vulture town halls on the hunt for the motorhome driver. One of the few places that fits a motorhome in play de aro and they forbid it. I find such a ban ridiculous. They are some sausages... raising money is the only thing that matters to them."
413338,2903289,5,JPerez3,29/06/2023,"We stayed 1 night a couple of weeks ago or 3, before putting up the sign. The truth is that it is a great place, close to the beach and with services. A shame to lose places like these."
413338,2876804,1,tita66,21/06/2023,we have just arrived the place looks nice but actually a sign indicates that we cannot sleep here!
413338,2858545,1,crissogs,15/06/2023,"There is a very large sign that says it is forbidden to spend the night, camp... without dates... fine."
413338,2811716,5,lucioledeb,02/06/2023,Awesome ! Easily accessible with lots of places in front of the sea and right next to a great beach! The police pass by and say nothing to us on the condition of not spreading out like in a campsite. Thank you for this spot!
413338,2748717,5,Virgile03,14/05/2023,Very good quiet place and easy to park with small bins available as well as immediate access to the beach with several selective sorting too and also open beach showers. Please leave the place clean and park properly so that it is not forbidden to us.
413372,3166503,4,ToniGarcia,17/08/2023,"With time, you can park well, but if you arrive late on a weekend, there is no space."
413386,3210041,4,La_Canija,24/08/2023,"We spent one night, a fairly large field of land with some shade, no noise at night, close to the town to visit the caves, the entrance is a little further ahead of the payment area, to the left is the P200mts, it has 4 stars because the treatment plant is nearby and sometimes you get a smell and because the exit from the parking lot to the road is somewhat narrow and has a lot of vegetation"
413436,2953697,3,LaBigDobbe,12/07/2023,"relatively quiet campsite, generous space but difficult to park with a trailer, nice showers to take in the morning, the evening is cold, lack of entertainment for children, the mini-market is really very small and expensive, the swimming pool is pleasant, good space games but the children's one is freezing. Restaurant does not make you want to, the surroundings are nice, beautiful beach and fishing museum recommended"
413484,2863842,5,BartNomade,17/06/2023,"Very quiet area, just a few minutes walk from the city center. It has space for draining black and gray water and also for supplying drinking water. The visible faucet does not have a thread for a hose, but there is another one, with a thread, opening the door on the side. The views of the mountains are wonderful. Many thanks to the municipality of Vistabella for making this space available."
413484,2764671,5,rickimarke,19/05/2023,Great that the community set up this place. Bellavista has a very exposed location and having 5 to 6 straight pitches is something special. The square is 5 minutes from the center. Great view in addition. Many thanks to the city.
413521,2962642,3,Ainhoa050121,14/07/2023,"Since in that area it is not allowed to spend the night. As a last resort it's not bad. It is a siding on the same road, just to stop and sleep, not too bad."
413548,3291931,3,Vicmatil,13/09/2023,"Today at least we were able to refill water without paying, the tap worked without putting in any coin. It seems that the toilet can be emptied, but it is true that there is no grate on the floor to empty gray water."
413548,3220034,1,alexia14,26/08/2023,Bad experience: there is a charge for water (€2) but it was impossible to insert coins or pay by card because there was no payment terminal + we were unable to drain because a pipe was needed (not grid on the ground to park on)
413548,3005429,1,Punchas,23/07/2023,"only water not running, the good thing is that it is free"

Despite being on the road, the night was very quiet (3 or 4 cars an hour). The gas station closes overnight, but in the morning you can have a decent coffee for €1, and the staff are lovely."
413583,3287556,5,marcuesta,12/09/2023,"The area is very far from the city, lonely, at night they close the gas station and you are left isolated and alone. coffee refers to a simple machine. a disappointment!!"
413583,3230326,2,Störti01,28/08/2023,"Have approached this place. But it wasn't inviting enough to stay overnight. So can't give any further information. But despite all that, thank you for this opportunity."

413583,3050256,5,JoseCarlos,31/07/2023,The service they provide is wonderful. Totally recommended. Besides the workers are a charm.
413583,3048957,5,CharoT,31/07/2023,"Very clean. Very well lit. We arrived on Sunday July 30 at 12pm and there were only 2 caravans. Fenced parking for caravans. Next to the ""ocho"" gas station (it is not 24 hours). At the foot of the road, it has traffic of cars. We liked it even more when we saw it during the day. The guy at the gas station is super friendly. Everything is very clean, there is room for dirty water There is no noise from people etc."
413583,2960285,1,campersitos,13/07/2023,"It is a parking lot of the gas station simply fenced. Next to the national highway with a lot of traffic, it does not inspire confidence and security. We arrived and no one was there so we decided not to stay."
413583,2790422,5,ldewell,27/05/2023,"This place was a great stop. The staff were really accommodating, they gave a discount for diesel to campers as described by others. There a clean place to empty the toilet cassette, and it was actually quite quiet during the night."
413583,2784841,5,8patasy4ruedas,25/05/2023,"MAGNIFICENT. Many thanks to the property for their dedication to motorhomes. An area that they are preparing on a whim. The entire area fenced and properly lit. It is also worth it and a lot to refuel since they apply a discount of 19 cents/l for motorhomes... The person who attended us was very friendly and helpful, and there was hardly any traffic at night... THANK YOU"
413587,3220707,5,alexmonica13,26/08/2023,"Ideal place in Peneda Geres. The visats are spectacular and there are picnic tables to eat at. We spent one night there without any problem, we were the only car. Waking up to those views was beautiful."

413624,2845682,3,adaralysa,12/06/2023,"The place is fine, but at night young boys come and race motorcycles inside the premises and drink bottles. At 08:00 a.m. on weekdays the operators of the enclosure with the lawn mowers wake you up. The services of grey, black water, etc. are quite good."
413624,2785427,5,ensco,25/05/2023,Quiet place with services although this time they were closed. For the rest I recommend it. You have to be careful because on Saturday morning they put on a market and I think you have to wait all morning to get out. The market does not bother at all.

We got stuck in the sand/stones with a big motorhome. Do not drive or turn in the sand/stones. De police drived by by accident and got us a number for a truck station to get us out of the place for €306,00. Not worth that much money to swim here haha. Be carefull!"

Go for a morning swim or anytime swim for that matter. Be careful, the rocks can be deceptive and you may get stuck. 300m down the road south is more firm ground just before the bend in the road."

This place brims with potencial! With just a bit of investment on the access and outside shower and bathroom this place can easily turn into a 5* place.

Best wishes to the owners"

413954,2773529,4,sposoz,21/05/2023,The place is super quiet and I would have rated it 5 stars if the owner hadn't tried to charge 3 nights for 2 nights. His argument: it was 3 days....
413954,2772834,5,Dutchess1,21/05/2023,We stayed here for two nights. When we arrived the gates were closed but after ringing the tel nr. on the gate the man came and let us in. We were alone until another caravan arrived. The peace was so enjoyable with a cacophony of birds in the background . Showers were warm and very clean.
413955,2756170,3,lorenitalory,17/05/2023,"I spent a quiet night here because I couldn't get to the one on the beach, in the morning the local police saw me and told me that everything was fine as long as I didn't have anything outside!"

414077,3183941,5,polus1980,19/08/2023,Spectacular!!! Area 20 km from Ponferrada. You can stay overnight for free if you dine there. The burgers and handmade tacos are spectacular. Afterwards you can enjoy the chill out atmosphere with a mojito. Very TOP. Congratulations on the initiative. The place is very charming and the treatment is great.
414077,2995207,5,misscortes,21/07/2023,"A special place like its owner and his friends. I have spent a beautiful evening and a quiet night. Waking up watching the sunrise from here, a real luxury. The food is great and it is pet friendly. I invite you. try the experience."
414077,2879748,5,asierzavi,22/06/2023,"It's a perfect place, I wish there were more places like this. The hamburger, very good, the owner, Iván, magnificent. The super quiet night in the field that it has and waking up with the crow of the rooster. We are very grateful to the people who bet on making this type of sites"
414077,2853215,5,LosVecis,14/06/2023,"This place is wonderful, beautiful, well-kept, with a dreamy sunset! We have spent an incredible night under the stars and in total tranquility, the owner is more than magnificent, the food is 10 (my mouth is watering when I remember that burger!!) and Alambra beer! Did you think you couldn't have it all? Well, head over to the place ;)"

414097,3172844,4,magetcyril,18/08/2023,"Very pleasant and very quiet area, we had a very good night. Lots of space and a part under pine trees… Thanks to the municipality for this free area, with filling water and emptying of gray water + toilet. Nevertheless it would be nice if people spanking their needs in nature, pick up their destroyed…. Do not complain after we are restricted!"
414097,2843312,5,sofiadb,11/06/2023,"Excellent place to spend the night. Plenty of shade, water available (potable and grey). Some parts of the terrain are dirt and not very flat and others quite regular. Nothing to do/visit in the surroundings, in mid-June."
414097,2783744,3,MarcosGranda,25/05/2023,"The access road is narrow, it is far from the town, and the surface is of moved earth, they would have to condition it a little more. On the other hand, a quiet place with loading and unloading of water. We have spent the night and no discomfort."
414156,3194773,4,30051962,21/08/2023,Thank you to the municipality for installing this air for the CC. Free water drain and wc.
414156,3159811,5,MarcelinoTomas,16/08/2023,"Flawless! Clean, spacious, free. Needs a 1/2"" adapter for drinking water. Thanks, Junta de Freguesia do Cercal. Well done. Just a few minutes walk away, it's worth trying a typical Alentejo dish at one of the local restaurants. Thanks again, Cercal."
414156,3129715,5,florian.moles@orange.fr,12/08/2023,"Great, thank you to the municipality for this free service. Respect the places"

We stayed one night and we were lucky to coincide with the local party. We enjoyed its gastronomy and music. The area super clean and neat, please let's keep it that way."
414156,3058167,4,AnaCerqueira,01/08/2023,"fantastic service, quiet place, affordable. no hoses, however there is a hardware store nearby that sells hoses and faucet fittings at affordable prices. congratulations to parish councils, such as Cercal, which have these free initiatives for those who want to discover our beautiful Alentejo by caravan! well there is!!!"

414189,3037130,3,Micksol75,28/07/2023,"Somewhat complicated access, not recommended for large vehicles. Place with spectacular views, ideal for a picnic and hanging out, but not recommended for sleeping, too steep."
414203,3207185,5,PabloMP,23/08/2023,Very good place to spend the night. We had to wait a bit for people from the beach to leave so we could place the van in an almost flat area with views of the beach. To get out there is an intersection where you have to maneuver if you have a large van (I have a L2) and I have to maneuver a little. The beach is very very beautiful and has a very good sunset.
414203,3202203,5,miren_camper,22/08/2023,"Amazing site. In the middle of August I arrived at 9:15 p.m. and found a place with a gate to the beach. As the others say, nude beach. There is a beach bar with music until late and a restaurant. There are bathrooms open during the day. There are no showers, only for feet. Nearby there are larger beaches with more services. Glimpses. Flat ground."
414203,3189276,5,MariaLuixa,20/08/2023,"WONDERFUL! We arrived in the morning, with poor weather and plenty of free places. It filled up as the weather improved, but they were freed again in the evening. Beautiful nudist beach, straight paths from the coast to the nearby beaches (Pragueira and Montalvo). 12.00-20.00 lifeguard service and open toilet. There is also a source. Food and drink in the bar, good music and friendly people!"
414203,3104249,5,idizlor,08/08/2023,Spectacular place.
414203,3097292,4,Alonshow,07/08/2023,Very crowded but in the late afternoon there are good places. Beautiful sunset and a very good nudist beach with all services.
414203,3095419,5,LaraAM,07/08/2023,"Parking at nudist beach. Good place to spend the night, but in high season there is a large influx of vehicles. In the evening there are more chances of getting a good spot. Anaís' beach bar is the best for listening to live music and having a drink or dinner."
414203,3065262,5,markius,02/08/2023,"I love this place but here there are motorhomes with more than 6m long. the straightest part is entering to the left if there are cars waiting, why do they leave at sunset"
414203,2974063,3,patritri,16/07/2023,"the exit with the current signaling very complicated for 7 meters. We had to go out because it is prohibited, which is about 300 meters"
414203,2937603,5,VSO,08/07/2023,"Parking that clears up in the evening. Perfect, quiet, incredible views, bathrooms and shower feet (they close at night). Fresh water jet on the beach. Anaís's beach bar is incredible, she, Carlos, Vanesa... exceptional food. It is very worth it."
414203,2924387,5,Sera86,04/07/2023,We were last year with our 7m motorhome and without problems

414306,2873906,4,nsnsmith,20/06/2023,"Simple stopover, adjacent to housing. Quiet, peaceful but with water only. Just off Autopista Norte."
414316,3114023,4,BeaIsaac,10/08/2023,"You have to go down from the town along a slightly steep road with a 20% unevenness, you arrive at a small parking lot next to a pebble beach, it puts a sign prohibiting bathing due to a landslide, it is worth coming, beautiful views."
414325,2883219,5,Travelcrazynl,23/06/2023,really nice place. don't park in front of the waterfall there is a spot 50m from it. really beautiful place. no cars passing at night. only one tiny town 1km up the hill and 1.5km down the hill beautiful sunset.
414356,3199902,5,egraye,22/08/2023,Lovely place for a quiet peaceful stay. Jacqui the hostess is amazing and so welcoming with two gorgeous well behaved dogs. Nice pool bar a short drive away. We definitely recommend and will will be returning in the near future.
414356,3124983,5,NiPaMe,11/08/2023,My girlfriend and I stayed at this amazing place on our way to Cabo de Gata. Not only the cute dogs but also the hostess is super nice and attentive and takes care of her guests very courteously. In the evening we sat together on the terrace.
414356,3091432,5,martilori,06/08/2023,"A lovely and quite place, sorrounded by nature, with a really warm welcoming and nice host and her two friendly dogs. The place is perfect if you have a camper/motorhome, but also our stay with our tent has been really comfortable, overall owe to the kindness of the owner. Hope to see us again!!"
414356,2922315,5,KnightBusTravel,04/07/2023,"We loved it so much here that we didn't want to leave! The plan was actually only one night, but somehow we ended up spending 3 wonderful days and nights here! It's so quiet and you have a wonderful view. The hostess is super nice - my daughter is in love with the dogs and my husband planted a tree for her hospitality!"
414356,2833985,5,BenSand123,08/06/2023,Lovely peaceful nights sleep with stunning views across the mountains. A very warm welcoming host with two beautiful dogs. Would highly recommend if your needing somewhere in the area.

414545,2765565,4,Gene2,19/05/2023,Good place to do catwalks and then sleep very quiet at night a little inclined
414607,3244670,3,sp43,01/09/2023,very quiet night. the ground is not very level but you can look for life. people walk early in the morning but do not bother.
414669,3108186,3,Nereaserra94,09/08/2023,It doesn't have any charm. A parking lot next to a park. There is nothing in the village apart from a steakhouse and a GR. It is a place to spend the night and follow the route. There are garbage and fountain.
414718,3121605,1,bodysalta,11/08/2023,"It has nothing, a thousand turns to get there and it is not the Mercadona car park, it is next door and there are few and uneven spaces"
414718,2998015,2,AridaneRP,21/07/2023,"Simple street parking, no shade and some incline. But it is a good place to park with AC if you go to Mercadona. Nothing else."
414790,3251134,5,YvieD,02/09/2023,Great place to stay with a warm welcome from Wade and Lisa who gave us a tour of where to go in the area and the river. Palmones is definitely worth a visit. We went canoeing from the back of their garden and if you like fishing/paddle boarding/canoeing it's a great place to stay. We'll definitely be back. Thank you both for your hospitality and a great few days.
414790,3234200,5,sophgerm,29/08/2023,"Fantastic people, very quiet and beautiful place right on the river (nature oasis in the industrial area - we couldn't believe it!). Wade and Lisa are warm and open-minded people who put a lot of love into the pitch. Canoeing on the river is also definitely worth it! I can only enthusiastically recommend it!!"
414790,3180553,5,melomidot,19/08/2023,"Wade is a very welcoming, friendly and accommodating host. Its garden, calm, charming and fully equipped, is ideal for spending the night or a short stay. In addition, it is possible to rent a kayak to explore the river, adjacent to the property, and back up to the beach. We had a great time and highly recommend it!"
414790,3176762,5,aleden,18/08/2023,"Simply wonderful. The place kept very well, well-kept garden. Wade and Lisa (the owners) are funny, friendly and welcoming. It is advisable for those who are not used to bathing in the river to bring shoes, the seabed is slippery. Everything else PERFECT. A little advice for the owners: add a small bathroom and you will have no equal!"
414790,3166757,5,micheljeanluc,17/08/2023,"Motorhome area, superb large pitch on secure lawn with direct access to the river (canoe and paddle rental €15 per day) join the sea very pleasant moment friendly welcome owner always smiling and ready to help, recommend rating 6/5"

414790,3110598,5,MarjaStrid,09/08/2023,"The safe haven on a long journey. Lisa and Wade have created a beautiful garden with a lovely breeze cooling the area. Lot’s of shadow. Place is safe, clean and well maintained. I stayed there for four nights before my last leg of the long journey from Finland to Morocco. I left with warm memories, new friends and thanks to Wade, well maintained door hinges."
414790,3074297,5,JaiTheCamper,04/08/2023,What a super nice stay with the warm Wade and Lisa and their cute dog Peggy. Our visit was spontaneous and we could still go at 11.45 pm. There is electricity and it is a quiet place. Next morning Wade showed our kids around the river and the fish and they really enjoyed that. Recommended if you're passing through!
414790,3052589,5,mallorcacamper,31/07/2023,"The hosts Wade and Lisa are super friendly. We have felt very comfortable here. Like in your own garden. Services right on site. The place invites you to take a walk to the lake or a canoe tour directly from the house. The hosts have everything ready. The perfect place for a trip to Gibraltar. We paid €45 for 2 nights with a mobile home, 2 adults and 1 child including electricity and water. Top! Highly Recommended!"
414790,3037163,5,AdrianYol,28/07/2023,"A magnificent place to spend a few days in the area. Wade treated us great. It has electricity, water and sewage drainage. Very satisfied! Recommendable!"
414790,3034218,5,ggiiuu,28/07/2023,Wade enthusiastically and warmly welcomed us into his space. Everything matches as described. The place is quiet and private. I certainly recommend! :)
414790,3015540,5,NavajoCatral,24/07/2023,"A great host, sent us a video on how to arrive and open up. Perfect pitch under shady trees and level. Very secure and peaceful, walled with electric gate. Services handy.  Lovely river and just plain friendly.  We will surely return. Oh, and big name shops and great restaurants nearby!  Coffee shop steps away. Thank you for the nice stay!"
414790,2999852,5,Minnie11,21/07/2023,Top notch place to stay. Beautiful safe place with the option of hiring a canoe and accessing the river from site. Lawned area which our dogs loved. We biked (10mins ish with electric bike ) into Palmones where there are some fabulous Spanish restaurants which we enjoyed The hosts are great people and only too happy to help with anything. Thoroughly recommend
414790,2986858,5,salvari,19/07/2023,"An incredible place in the immediate vicinity of Algeciras with direct access to the river. It has been great for us to leave our caravan and then access Gibraltar only with the car. If it weren't for the fact that we were en route, it would be a perfect place to spend some time. The owners are awesome people. Absolutely recommended."
414790,2980939,5,Pavalijo,18/07/2023,"Wade and Lisa are great hosts and their site, an irrigated grass lawn and garden was a lovely oasis. We too were offered use of canoe and fishing gear but could only stay for two nights and were there to visit Gibraltar. We drove to the car park next to Gibraltar border control in under 15 minutes and enjoyed the hustle and bustle of Gibraltar before returning to the peace and quiet of Swallows Nest."
414790,2916934,5,fredetbasia,02/07/2023,"Wade and Lisa are amazing. They just make us feel welcome. You immediately feel good here. Everything is organised: a pretty zen corner, botanical garden, access to the river, motorhome with motorbike trailer parked without any problem. ideal for visiting Gibraltar. we had a nice canoe trip so we stayed three nights, too bad we have to think about going back up."
414790,2888112,5,gazza333,24/06/2023,Had a great overnight stay here with Wade and Lisa who couldn’t be more friendly hosts .  Lovely grass area that our dog loved.  All facilities and though we didn’t use - close to bars and cafes .Lisa let me use her fishing rod for a spot of fishing out the back garden. They hire canoes out and I’ll have to return to take them up on that . Highly recommend
414803,2985986,3,pinartboc,19/07/2023,"Quiet picnic area. Lots of shade. We spent the night here but at the top of the picnic, in the parking lot. It's not very cool to sleep on but it's been comfortable. There is a fountain and trash. Some cars on the road and lots of rabbits. Very cool in the middle of July!"
414843,3113115,5,JavierGandal,10/08/2023,"We have spent two very quiet nights. There is mobile coverage, very easy access and everything is very clean. It has the right services (water and drainage) but it is perfect for spending the night and taking a walk around the town. Many thanks to the town hall for creating this area, we will surely be back."
414843,2883429,5,TurisCarcelen,23/06/2023,"It is a new area to spend the night. It's pretty quiet. The ground is gravel and is full of olive trees. The town has several things to see and do. nature activities such as hiking and various monuments such as the castle, the hermitage, the church..."
414843,2883022,5,MiSchroe,23/06/2023,We had a quiet night. Very few barking dogs for a place on the outskirts of town. Access is via Calle San Blas.
414843,2802754,1,CarmenIgne,30/05/2023,We went and couldn't get in. He said that it was prohibited by the route that the GPS marked. That road was only for neighbors. It was prohibited. It would be good if whoever can enter says how to do it with a large motorhome.
414843,2782745,4,gofy14,24/05/2023,I slept very peacefully. There is still no equipment. It is newly created. Very pretty town. You can visit the castle for free and the lady who explains it is super attentive and nice. Thank you Cancel for welcoming motorhomes.
414868,2937677,1,reaflojo,08/07/2023,I couldn't find the spot
414897,3293633,4,aldarabc,13/09/2023,"Good option to spend the night, because it is a white zone, the entire San Sebastián payment zone. There is no height limit and the terrain is a bit uneven."
414897,3290732,5,KayMadejski,13/09/2023,"ideal place to visit San Sebastian, free, lots of space and easy to get to the city. it is not very charming, But practical! it was very quite at night i slept very well"
414897,3281639,3,hilaireRoland,10/09/2023,very convenient parking free bus to visit San Sebastian
414897,3263432,3,sinjajohanna,06/09/2023,"After a long search, the only way to stand (safely) overnight. It was very loud at night as there was construction work going on on the street above until 4am. We slept very poorly but overall the place is really okay. There were several other campers there with us."
414897,3259485,4,blaisegarnier,04/09/2023,"have just spent 1 night there, stations under the trees. Quiet (apart from the French couple who clashed loudly....) Visit to San Sebastian by bus after moving the vehicle to the side of the road...no breakage...700 m from the University of Sciences enjoy peace and greenery...."
414897,3244465,4,llitzet,01/09/2023,"Fairly large parking lot. Ideal for visiting the city. From the left of the Donostia Arena, the stairs lead down to the center. It takes about 30 minutes on foot. There is also a bus stop, but we didn't use it. It's a wasteland full of potholes and puddles, and that helps keep it from being filled with cars, which can park in the asphalt parking lot next door."
414897,3205381,4,zucche,23/08/2023,"Very quiet parking, nothing special, but it works perfect. Lanzadera buses leave across the street to San Sebastián and are free. Perfect"
414897,3202197,4,oscargr_69,22/08/2023,"Well, it's just a parking lot, no one loved it. but very convenient, a free shuttle bus every 20 minutes from 11 am to 10.20 pm. For that alone it is worth it to avoid suffering trying to park in SS. and be able to sleep peacefully."
414897,3129752,2,CaroBenner,12/08/2023,"Really littered and sometimes noisy with other people who are very disrespectful. Pretty full too. Still free and 8 minutes drive also free into the city, which you can use between 11 a.m. and about 10.30 p.m. The path is also easy to walk. Sewage disposal available and a faucet which I wasn't sure contained potable water."
414897,3093942,1,duke620,07/08/2023,"Not a nice place, but big enough. Unfortunately, the biggest problem is the campers themselves. Don't you have any toilets in your super cool vanlife boxes? Everywhere there is wild shitting at the edge of the parking lot and between the parked cars. This is disgusting, it stinks. I've seen people disappear with a toilet paper roll between a car and a large mobile home. Buy camping toilets."
414897,3072168,3,JasGruen,03/08/2023,"It's ok for one night. Attention, many mosquitoes! Had the pleasure because we didn't always have our screen door closed. We were told that there is a free shuttle bus into town every 20 minutes."
414897,3061389,2,pabloykathy,02/08/2023,"Parking without services at least I have not seen them! We spent the night here and just fine! There are not many options here! People pissing outside next to the ""camper"" cars in the morning, not suitable for fine people haha!

No toilets, but lots of free public toilets in the city itself and along the route. Possible to take a bus (line 21 or 28, costs €1,85) to the centre as well.

Quite a bit of litter on the grass and a slight smell of pee. Hopefully in future we can all leave it better than we found it."

It is a conflictive area and in a matter of 15 minutes it took us to get ready to sleep, more than 20 cars passed by with music blaring, too fast and most of them yelled at us to leave, that we were not welcome. Next door is where a bottle is made. We parked on a street in the town and we slept great"

Although there is exclusive parking for cars at the entrance, we asked at the restaurant and they told us that it was possible to park. We went with a 7.4m motorhome and had a hard time getting there, I think it is better for smaller vans. The situation is very beautiful to bathe in the reservoir, and eat at the bar. There are shaded picnic tables for eating."

416324,2891202,5,LalesyAbel,25/06/2023,A very practical stop since we usually buy at Lidl and there are the two specific places for AC without a problem to do day or night. Ten minutes walk to the promenade and the center. These initiatives are appreciated since closing times usually coincide with those of rest. Hot bread first thing in the morning!!

I don't know why they have such a mania for motorhomes, we consume the same or more than any other visitor. It was the only place that the mayor could keep the motorhomes collected. Well now Mr. Mayor we will have to park in the streets or not go anymore. I don't know what will be better for you."

It's very bad taste to be so selfish, in short there has to be everything. Otherwise it has a very good location, next to a dog park, level..."
419530,3268127,4,gelessanchez,07/09/2023,"unbeatable location, 10 minutes walk from the Plaza Mayor, it is a shame that the facility is not taken care of, the asphalt is lifted, dirt... Dog park next to the sports court which generates a lot of noise, the worst part is the garbage trucks entering and going out to the unloading area in the motorhome area, if you want peace, look for another place, if you want to get to know the city, this is your place"
419530,3267348,3,danielmaryse,07/09/2023,Nice place. Significant noise at 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. garbage collection but these workers are doing their job. thank you to the municipality for the services and location

419530,3201862,4,JorgeDuarte,22/08/2023,"I don't give 5 stars because you are only allowed to stay overnight, the police control registrations. Very quiet area away from traffic noise. It has 10 seats and some shades. The entrance to this ASA is not clearly identified, as it looks like the entrance to a private zone, and we are left in doubt."
419530,3188994,4,Familielangen,20/08/2023,"We didn't spend the night, but we can. Not a special place, but near the historic center. There is shade. Empty grey, black water and refill drinking water. So great facility. Old center is very beautiful!"

Thank you Cáceres for enabling these facilities"
419530,3167417,3,exploradorintrepido,17/08/2023,"Place very close to the historic center on foot. There were quite a few motorhomes and vans and everyone was very respectful. The only drawback is the issue of garbage cans, 3 trucks passed throughout the early morning making a lot of noise."
419530,3153013,3,julenarnz,15/08/2023,"It is lucky to have a free filling, emptying and overnight area, so close to the historic center, about a 10-minute walk, but I do not understand the issue of garbage, since workers come at dawn, and the noise they generate is really annoying. understanding that they are not to blame, since they are doing their job. We have not had a problem with odors, and the area is in a perfect environment"
419530,3122117,3,elfenix,11/08/2023,"The place is very good, quiet, except when they come to collect the garbage between 2 and 3 in the morning, otherwise I give it a ten, thanks for putting these areas very grateful. Very close to the center."

419530,3054545,2,rifmovilhome,31/07/2023,"The place is fine, I thank the Caceresc town hall, the collaboration for leaving us a space for the motorhome collective, But what does not seem fair to me that we have garbage containers and that is a bit marginalized. Nobody likes that I put the garbage in front of their house 30 garbage cans. I would only ask for that change. thank you so much"

419530,2977205,5,roshr1,17/07/2023,"Super quiet night, we had no problems with garbage trucks or smells. Above emptying and free filling. We should take more care of these sites."
419530,2913488,3,PEGAM,02/07/2023,superb parking area be careful not to cross the city center. possible parking for one of 7 m. a little bothered by the garbage collection. great city tour
419530,2899619,1,JSneedpark4night,27/06/2023,Park too close to a garbage dump. Unpleasant to have vehicles accessing that space leaving a terrible smell.

Unfortunately located at a central garbage collection point. 3-4 times in the night there were vehicles that exchanged full for empty garbage cans. In the morning then the garbage disposal to make all full empty. Don't expect a good night's sleep."
419530,2828754,3,sportti,07/06/2023,Parking not very glamorous near the garbage cans. Watch out for the trees. Free service.

419582,3270123,5,TomStdl,07/09/2023,"Fantastic! Super friendly and accommodating hosts. Neither of us spoke Spanish, but as the hostess said, ""Hospitality and joy are more important."" We stayed there for 2 nights and felt really comfortable. In addition to a large covered pool, we could have fun in the salon with billiards or a cold beer. Highly recommended! You will love it here!"
419582,3205018,5,oscarpatagoni,23/08/2023,"INCREDIBLE SERVICE, CORDIALITY, meals, breakfast, INDOOR SWIMMING POOL!, safe place for the camper!. The girls fell in love with the treatment of the owner, I take her to feed chickens, they made us paella!! We went to spend the night and we wanted to stay a week! They helped us discover the area and the rivera del Duero wines!! 10…no!! twenty!! Points for this lovely family! WE WILL BE BACK FOR MORE!"

419584,3032464,5,chakartoone,28/07/2023,small campers do not hesitate after the great Spanish crossing. relatively quiet place (passage of cars on the bridge in the background = deaf noise very bearable since against the bottom) very beautiful view of the mouth of the river and the bridge. pleasant stopover
419584,2904653,4,hyggewagen,29/06/2023,"Great spot for the night when driving between Portugal and Spain. Also suitable for multiple nights. There is space for many campers. The last bit of the approach can be tricky with a bigger camper. Bigger campers should choose the first turn to the left.
Be careful if it has been raining as the area will be very muddy. There is already a noticeable amount of trash around, don't leave your own!"
419649,3204725,3,piterr,23/08/2023,"Location close to a great little crowded beach. Correct services, clean toilets and showers. Assignment of plots a little out of control, if you arrive at the last minute they give you what is left over, even having made a reservation and payment in advance. Very expensive, there are other cheaper options nearby. €52 motorhome 2 people/ Day."
419649,3195624,4,Flokaka,21/08/2023,"Campsite very well located 10km from Nazaré and 2km from St Martino de Porto, nice campsite, but small pitches and with a lot of vis a vis. Access to a magnificent wild beach 15 minutes walk. Clean and functional toilets. The small white pebbles on the ground generate a lot of white dust, they could have put something else. Camping on a slope and it climbs steeply."
419649,3133086,3,Maite07,12/08/2023,"New campsite. Adequate plot with electricity and water. The sanitary facilities are very good, but perhaps they are a little tight for the number of people that fit in the campsite (showers above all and we ran out of paper in the women's bathroom). Spectacular pool. Very expensive restaurant for the quality and variety it offers."
419649,3096179,2,gp28,07/08/2023,Camping in height very well received worries about water too many people and for the incredible price for Portugal we paid 74 euros for one night for 2 adults and 2 teenage girls for one night ok but no more in a motorhome
419649,3081902,2,Fredi06,05/08/2023,Excessive price: 61 eur for 2 adults and a child in a van on a pitch without shade. No entertainment on Saturday or Sunday. It should cost 20eur less
419649,3080622,4,Janis181,05/08/2023,"Well located near a wild beach and the town beach 8 minutes by bike. A bit expensive, motorhome and two people €54. The pitches are wide and level, but the whole campsite is white gravel which is very dusty that you put in the motorhome and it is not pleasant. Large swimming pool, slides for children, a pool with a Jacuzzi and a sports facility near the bungalows."
419649,3075266,5,jyjoef,04/08/2023,Excellent welcome in French the very substantial and quality services are in line with the price charged Specific camping car pitch very well done very beautiful beach nearby I recommend
419649,3047030,5,Rafikis,30/07/2023,"For me, next to Turiscampo in the Algarve, one of the best campsites in Portugal. Even better than this because there is walking access to a wild beach and the best sunsets in the area. It is true that they have just reopened it and it is filming, but it promises if it stays that way. Spectacular setting. €69 4pax high season."
419649,3041072,3,simonwilhelm,29/07/2023,the place is very fine dusty - after that everything is full of it. Good pool - but all in all far too expensive - we paid over 60 euros for 2 adults and 2 children...
419649,2984718,5,grapillard,18/07/2023,"Nice campsite with 2 children: swimming pools with slide, various sports grounds, easy access to wild beaches and public beaches, clean sanitary facilities in perfect condition. A real pleasure for 2 nights. Very friendly staff."

419649,2969673,4,arnevoelkner,15/07/2023,"Brand new place of the Yelloh! Group. Terraced pitches of various sizes. All are fresh gravel and there is no green. Wash houses are freshly renovated and great. Water park for children from 6 really great. The way to the beach seems to be very difficult. All in all a good place to offer the kids something different. If you are looking for peace and seclusion, this is not the place for you."
419649,2954471,4,ccasales12,12/07/2023,"Camping from the French Yelloh village chain, one of the best in the area, the pools and slides are very cool, but since the temperature is not very high, it is usually cold to bathe, a high price but after being in other campsites in Portugal, it is worth it worth paying."
419649,2953686,3,ToMaTe87,12/07/2023,Value for money is just not right. The sanitary facilities would have to be cleaner and the indoor pool and showers there warmer/warmer. The staff and the animation was however very friendly. Places cut weird. Maybe something for older kids who want to slide all day long. Not recommended with small children. A pity.
419649,2945361,2,Manono56,10/07/2023,Very expensive campsite €49 per night. recently yelloh village. the facilities look great but we didn't go there as there is a 2 night requirement in July and August.
419649,2929700,4,spaceann,06/07/2023,"Good camping, very new, some details are still missing. The plots are small, it is noticeable that each square meter is used to add more plots. Most unleveled. We came when it wasn't very crowded yet so it was very good. Bread in the morning in the shop, restaurant, bar, swimming pool, spa... the town of Sao Martinho is worth a visit and can be reached on foot."
419649,2925092,4,leonifelix,05/07/2023,Very nice place. New sanitary facilities but a bit expensive.

419649,2902144,3,DamaraNorris,28/06/2023,"Knew this wasn't going to be cheap but we were sold the €33 pitch for 2 people when we asked for €30 pitch without waste water disposal. Also states pitch was 80 to 100 sqmetres which wasn't.. Maybe 75 sq meters.
Some pitches very narrow with waste water drains sticking up in middle. Some only 5x6 metres. Very few were level.
Over priced and pitches very variable. WiFi backbone speed very poor."
419649,2893215,4,isac99,26/06/2023,"It is part of the Yello group so is on the luxury end of camping. Paid €39 for a large pitch with electric, water and grey water disposal (need your own pipe). Very family friendly so full of children. No construction noise now so it is finished. Showers are excellent with unlimited hot water. Restaurant is expensive - I ordered the grilled chicken and the portion was very small with 3 drumsticks"
419649,2882213,4,msbulli,22/06/2023,Newly renovated. Pool area very nice for adults and children. Mini market and washing machine available.

I highly recommend it.!!!!"

Spoilers: still awake at 9am. is paid in advance, you cannot shorten it and therefore no money back. newly created yes, but for 78 parking spaces (!!) there is ONE sanitary building! the other is under construction. Yes, it doesn't (YET) get moldy, but it's not clean! no shade depending on the pitch."
419649,2827202,4,isabelllaaa,06/06/2023,"Great campsite. Unfortunately still in the renovation phase. Sanitary facilities partially closed, but new, modern and clean. Pool, slide system, basketball/football field, children's playground available! Plenty of pitches for campers/vans (1 night = 25 euros) Walk to the beach about 20 minutes, sometimes very steep. But great, quiet beach."
419649,2825996,3,ludwighu,06/06/2023,"Very nice camping site if it would be finished! As of today it is just halfly done and some of the bathrooms are not opened yet, there is construction noise in some areas, etc.

Charging the full price seems a little overpriced as long as it's still under construction... Otherwise it would be a very nice site with quick access to a nice beach!"

The motto is: everything is possible, nothing must be done. We will definitely come back. Greetings, Marcellino and Wendy and the children"
419944,2976910,5,AnneenRik,17/07/2023,"Blissful tranquility, spacious pitches between the olive trees, pleasant swimming pool, everything very neat, warm welcome. Carlos and Emi are very sweet helpful people and that in combination with a wonderful place. We can not wish for more . If we're in the area, we'll definitely be back!"
419944,2826871,5,RinkeFierloos,06/06/2023,"Beautiful place between the olive trees. We have been there last summer. Friendly managers. For example, there may be more camper pitches."
419944,2824580,5,rvdrschelde,06/06/2023,"beautiful area and wonderfully quiet between the mountains, from the place a beautiful view. 3 km from the village where everything is. very friendly hostess and host and you feel very welcome. we will definitely come back."
419967,2982247,5,Slybz,18/07/2023,"I did not park there, only to drain and fill the tank with water. Very practical."
419967,2897617,1,bocaderio2013,27/06/2023,"The place is not extraordinary, but clean, free and close to a pretty chapel and the center where we discovered an excellent restaurant with traditional and refined cuisine, O Valero, good wines and a warm welcome. In short, a great discovery."
419967,2885558,1,Carlikun,24/06/2023,It is an esplanade away from the city. There was no one with a motorhome. Not worth it. We went to sleep in another place. What if we were in the municipal swimming pools and they are really good
420109,3158469,5,Elilya,16/08/2023,"Very calm place. We are in August, the swimming pool does not seem to be open. Only one car was parked out front last night around 7 p.m. We have been alone ever since. Restful stopover on the road."
420126,3237808,5,jarcelus,30/08/2023,"Very good option to finish your laundry quickly. They have 5 washing machines and 4 dryers. There are chairs to sit on. In addition to filling up with gas, you can have a coffee at the mini-cafeteria. The toilets are very clean. The bad thing for motorhomes is that there is no space to park. But someone can always stay while the others park nearby at the Eroski."
420126,3135403,5,lafamiliacamperina,13/08/2023,Gas station where you can empty gray and for €1 you have 5 minutes of non-potable water. 14 kg washing machine and dryer for €12. Each thing lasts about 35 minutes. In just over an hour you have everything clean and dry. The tokens are taken out at the gas station.
420351,3216209,5,superbabi11,25/08/2023,"Great hosts, very friendly and attentive. They welcomed us great! They have plenty of space to park caravans. The toilets are great, clean, large and spacious. They left us some bicycles and we were able to go down to the town to a very fun bar. 100% recommended, a real and unique experience."
420351,3210686,5,FamilieMayer,24/08/2023,"We felt very comfortable. Super nice, helpful family. They even loaned us an adapter. The bathroom is modern and clean, and we didn't even find the composting toilet strange. It's only 15 minutes to Milfontes and the sea which we really enjoyed. The playground around the corner was small and well kept and the kids had a good time too."
420351,2839486,5,ReisemitJack,10/06/2023,Very nice family. We received a very warm welcome and felt comfortable there. The location is great. Also the proximity to the beach. We also had no problems driving in and out with our 8 m long caravan. Electricity and water are available.
420358,2875379,2,chjohn,20/06/2023,It's a shame about the beautiful little bay! There's a lot of rubbish lying around. The parking lot is about 150 meters higher and is nowhere flat! We drove on.
420383,2825877,4,Sin.deentrega,06/06/2023,Laundry in shopping center. Very close to motorhome parking. You can walk
420439,3294221,5,lucia2p2z,14/09/2023,"It is possible to spend the night (also if you have a tent on the roof of the van). The owner is super friendly. There are services included in the price (€20): washing machine, bathroom with shower and a small kitchen. Amazing view! I recommend 100%"
420439,3282059,5,Promise,10/09/2023,"Beautiful place to spend the night! The parking boy is very friendly, he has recommended excellent tapas places to us. If you are looking for a quiet place, with charm and views, this is the best by far!"

420439,3248864,4,Fle.vio,02/09/2023,"Very small but suggestive private camper area. To get there, enter the restaurant gate and immediately turn right. We did not see the black and gray water discharge. Very kind and courteous owner. Not suitable for large and/or small-displacement campers as there is a very steep climb to get out on a poorly maintained road. For any problem the owner will help you"
420439,3111262,5,juliazenz,09/08/2023,"Highly recommended. The owner (Carlos) is very helpful and speaks basic English (for those who don't speak Spanish). The whole place looks as if the owner had put it together with loving hard work. You will be provided with the most necessary (washing machine, shower and toilet) clean. Only criticism: there is no wifi, it's a little hard to find and once there there isn't much to do nearby other than a restaurant. Otherwise there is a bus connection to the city nearby."
420439,3110272,5,claireetmicka,09/08/2023,Arrival a little tricky and not very well indicated: Google Maps and not Waze. Carlos the owner is very nice and outgoing. The site offers a beautiful view and quick access to visit Malaga. 20 euros for 4 people with all services. We recommend
420439,3078374,5,eloandco,05/08/2023,"The idea is really to stay on the main road until the Minilla restaurant, enter the car park and take the descent! You are there. You will meet a charming man there, who will explain to you that you have access to the shower, wk, washing machine, outdoor kitchen, microwave, water, waste water disposal as well as electricity at no extra charge at the price indicated for the night."
420439,3074665,5,tiagovanlife22,04/08/2023,Beautiful place with lovely owners with all the services. Easy to find with google maps and 37 bus to malaga is only 10min walking great place.

420439,3073767,4,viciac,04/08/2023,"Beautiful view and nicely prepared campsite. Owner very friendly! We were allowed to use sun loungers, the washing machine and the summer kitchen for free. Unfortunately there was only one bathroom with shower and toilet for everyone! There was often the situation that you couldn't go to the toilet because someone was taking a shower... In addition, the bathroom was very dirty. That's why my shower tray overflowed..."
420439,3045742,1,charles31820,30/07/2023,"area very complicated to find no sign, nothing .... Moreover what is very important to point out is that the 4km to go to the city center or to the beach, it is hills between 10 and 15% so the bike don't even bother to think about it unless you're an experienced cyclist When we saw that we quickly left for the other area by the beach"
420439,3024036,4,gado19,26/07/2023,"We spent one night here; romantic place, well-kept and very quiet. Spectacular sunset over the sea, clean facilities and really helpful owner. The only flaw: there are no trees to protect from the sun during the day."
420439,3021782,5,lenare,26/07/2023,"Super cute campsite! Clean bathroom, great view and the host Carlos is extremely nice! 10/10"
420439,3018042,5,jppimenta,25/07/2023,"Small and well-appointed place, with a very relaxed atmosphere. A 1 hour walk from Malaga beach, but being far away it is also quite safe. To get to the park, go to the La Minilla restaurant, turn off the road to the entrance to the restaurant's parking lot, and at the end of the climb, just before reaching the parking lot, go down to the right. Steep descent but worth it!"
420439,2998569,5,heleneritter,21/07/2023,"Best campsite in a long time! Super nice atmosphere, the owner Carlos is extremely nice and accommodating. We really enjoyed our time and would come back again and again."

I recommend !"

Carlos is an excellent host, he makes you feel at ease and offers you all the necessary services: bathroom with shower, washing machine, a small outdoor kitchen where you can also cook. There is a crazy view and a relaxing atmosphere that is difficult to find elsewhere! deserves 10 stars. The climb to get out is not very suitable for low-power motorhomes."
420439,2943819,5,luzfab,09/07/2023,"we spent with my family a very good time, the view is very beautiful and soothing. Carlos is a very welcoming person, he made it easy for us to settle in. the facilities are very practical and there is everything you need: shower, toilet, a place to cook. the atmosphere is pleasant and relaxed with other campers. thank you again for this great discovery."

There is a toilet and shower, which are clean and tidy. Definitely highly recommended if you are going to visit Malaga. The way back is a bit steep but doable ;)"
420439,2930420,5,capitangelato,06/07/2023,"Only 5 stars are not enough for this place!!! It has everything van travellers need plus a special atmosphere. The location is very pleasant and well cared, plus you can enjoy a wonderful sea view while lulled by a soft fresh wind. Carlos, the host, is the most welcoming and warm person. Parking, shower (H/C water), wc, washing machine, electricity, cooking/washing facilities for 15 euros."

420439,2921929,5,ParentsVoyageurs,04/07/2023,Impeccable location for visiting Malaga. The view and the calm are perfect for a stopover of one or two nights. We went down in Cabify in the center. Very warm welcome and all conveniences.
420439,2906085,5,angelinademol,29/06/2023,"We have spent 4 unforgettable days in this plot. The friendly owner, Carlos, installed a lawn for us and we had the awning and a table the entire stay. We also did bike routes to the city center (electric bikes, the climb is somewhat steep). We loved this place. We recommend it."
420439,2902944,5,ClaudiaZu,28/06/2023,"Spectacular place, services and to highlight, the kindness of Carlos and María, as well as the rest of the people who stopped at the place. We will repeat!!! It is better for small vehicles because of accessibility"
420439,2896732,5,HaraldSchell,27/06/2023,"Very nice quiet place. With a great view and a nice restaurant and bar with a great view just around the corner. New plumbing (didn't work well for us and wasn't finished yet but has potential, so we don't deduct a star). Nice owner. Finding the campsite was a bit of a challenge (FYI past the restaurant on the right) but otherwise everything was great."
420439,2884484,4,clementmorgane,23/06/2023,"A place you absolutely must not miss. on the heights of Malaga with a splendid view and quiet. The owner is exceptionally kind and caring. The price is 15 euros which includes hot shower, wc, electricity and a small summer kitchen with microwave oven, a small induction hob and washing machine. Thank you for this beautiful place."
420439,2882216,5,timundsophie,22/06/2023,"i love it here! Apart from the great view, you felt very welcome! The dear owner puts so much love into his new place, he hasn't been open for long and it's already wonderful! Small bathroom, outdoor kitchen, seating to relax.. wow! There is no gray water and no emptying of the chemical toilet possible :) but that's not bad :)!"
420439,2877769,5,Milisaracho,21/06/2023,"It's lovely. To get there you have to go down a small street, quite steep but worth it. The bathroom is immaculate. Carlos the owner of the place is very kind. Nice place to stay. Very calm"
420439,2869031,5,soti0530,18/06/2023,"Beautiful place! There's a lot of love in it. Pay attention to small things (light chains, turf,...). No mosquitoes/flies in the evening. The operator super friendly. A great bathroom is being made here. The sanitary facilities are currently in a caravan. But very clean and connected to the sewage system. Access to the square short and steep, but doable. Really a placetobe!!!!"
420439,2867827,5,Abopascal,18/06/2023,Intimate and natural family location. being improved top with a beautiful view of malaga to get around bike c doable but scooter c better and perfect 3 kms from the city and beach owners super friendly pleasant very adorable very smiling warm welcome where life is good I recommend to bottom
420439,2866150,5,pjotrmaudens,18/06/2023,"We never imagined that we would find such a beautiful place close to Malaga. The view is really idyllic. It has a fully equipped bathroom and we were allowed to use the washing machine for free by Carlos, the owner. We were there for 4 nights so that came in very handy. A 10 for the hospitality! Thank you, we will definitely come back again."
420439,2854497,5,M29R05,14/06/2023,"We stayed 3 days in Malaga. This place was a great choice! It is very close to the city center and at the same time, surrounded by nature. Carlos was very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is very pleasant! To do again!"
420439,2840188,5,CarloteyMaria,10/06/2023,"We go down to the center which is about 5 minutes by bike. The return, yes, a somewhat pronounced climb. Super quiet night with a beautiful sunset looking at the sea. Flat plot and each with its own lawn. Very comfortable!!"
420439,2826380,5,bebipinto,06/06/2023,"An unforgettable visit. Carletes was very kind. We rode a bike and there are some really cool routes starting from right there. Ideal for visiting Malaga, very safe to leave tables and everything you want outside. I recommend it 100%"

420494,2919262,3,Enricktm,03/07/2023,very pretty cove. You have to walk 35 minutes. It is not allowed for vehicles of more than 5 mt. since the parking lot is quite small. The watchman let us stay for taking small children but warned us not to do it anymore. My motorhome makes 7 mt. That's why I give it three stars.
420555,3114925,4,Poutchouc,10/08/2023,"Flat tarmac car park, away from traffic. No service but 2 minutes walk from the center of the village with its cafes, restaurants and shops. We were out of school time and the parking lot was empty. We had a very quiet night. I recommend this car park with easy access and I strongly advise against venturing into the narrow and sloping streets of the village if you have a large CC"

I am equipped so no worries for me.

420663,3115561,5,PaskusVan,10/08/2023,"Area next to the motorway, very easy access, so you don't leave the C-16 or C-25 route or take a break without safety problems. Water filling and emptying service at €2 for 5 minutes with a lot of pressure. Nearby gas station-bar-restaurant and butane. Less than 1 km away is the Esplai Caravaning, workshop, AC spare parts store. You can spend the night in the town in areas close to supermarkets and bars-restaurants"
420663,3042037,1,3gattetes,29/07/2023,"Area too close to the road and far from the town and services. Too much noise at night and, since it is next to a gas station I felt unsecure at night. There are much better and free places to sleep in town."
420663,2906042,4,BartNomade,29/06/2023,"We stopped just to see. The area is all paved and flat and the services are correct. As it is next to the highway, the noise must be a little disturbing to sleep. On the other hand, access is quick and easy, to continue your journey later."
420667,3245511,3,jeanjeannyny,01/09/2023,not bad going back and forth in the night until 3am good for a short night
420667,3178008,3,himmelauferden,19/08/2023,The highway can be heard well but the noise level is low. Not much was going on here on Saturday night. But there are a lot of mosquitoes here. From time to time a car drives by at night or parks on the square to disappear again later. Nobody bothered us. In the morning you can be observed from office windows. For one night ok.

420777,2915123,3,aldipa,02/07/2023,The acs do enter through the road that goes to the cemetery (the road is before the town) (paved) and you can see it well from a distance if someone is coming. The parking lot fits well. Be careful when entering and exiting the parking lot (4 large ones and there was no one when we went) and the most absolute silence. The super amazing viewpoint with its views.

421431,3219671,2,Itxkolibri,26/08/2023,"Very dirty and neglected place. I don't understand how Ourense doesn't have a slightly more careful area or parking for AC and vans. I did not stay The hot springs are close, that's the only advantage I see in this place."

421431,3098180,4,Saracam7,08/08/2023,"Although it lacks services, we slept one night due to the proximity to the hot springs and the center. We spent a quiet night next to more AC If there is no room in this field, there was more AC in front"

421581,3009224,1,FamiliaRodriguezGonzalez,23/07/2023,"The clothes do not smell of softener, it says that with one more euro it gives you more time but if you are with the door open for a long time it restarts at two again, the clothes come out very wet and thus they charge you more for drying. I do not recommend it if it is not an emergency."

422154,3200610,4,sonnita186,22/08/2023,We slept here even though it was forbidden. They didn't tell us anything. The place is cool even if you bring repellent because there are lots of mosquitoes. Don't worry. And semi cool compared to Valencia.
422154,2937100,2,Kalamunda,08/07/2023,Position is the parking lot of the Port of Cataruga which used to be a magnificent place to overnight but now is part of the Albufera National Park and all camper/motorhome parking is forbidden

422255,3095980,4,bodysalta,07/08/2023,"Very spacious parking with some shadows and not very steep, it has a bar 50 m away and a very good skatepark next door. A few km from the best views of Nazare although a bit far from the beach (especially the return is long because it is uphill). On Friday mornings they don't let you park. Very little noise and wide spaces"
422255,3072221,3,JYE19,03/08/2023,We parked for about three hours while we visited the beach area. It took us 20' to walk to the beach. We return in Uber for €4. There were several cars that looked like they had spent the night. We saw it safe for the day.

We took carrots, onions, peppers and tomatoes with us"
422259,3172864,5,tobiloiby,18/08/2023,The approach was easy to manage. The pitch was very nice and quiet. Joshua is an incredibly nice personality and hospitable. We made pizzas with him using vegetables from his own garden. He told us about life in Spain. His dog Lola is very playful and trusting. He gave us vegetables from the garden. We would always come back!
422259,3148313,5,xabier.zuia,14/08/2023,"Very good. Quiet and simple place. Access by a path of stones and earth. No problems for a camper. Joshua prepares you pizzas, bread in a wood oven. Garden products. Place under development. good luck with the project"
422259,3107060,5,lucky94,09/08/2023,Joshua is a very nice guy and fixed all issues that people commented before. We had no Problem to get to his place with our campervan. His dog Lola is also really friendly. We enjoyed our stay a lot and had a quiet night next to the olive trees. Thanks again for the veggies and good luck with your project!
422259,3080132,5,MikeBenzin,05/08/2023,"Were there with the 12t. Getting there was absolutely no problem. (It might not be recommended with a lawnmower bulldog, but the Spanish road network wasn't built for that either). The homemade pizzas were delicious, we even took some with us. Very friendly and trustworthy owner, gladly again."
422259,3044102,3,marcimimi,30/07/2023,"Joschua greeted us very friendly, was very considerate and put Lola on a leash because of our 2 small children. We were given fresh figs and a tour of his self catering garden. But 3 heart star access very narrow also difficult to drive through the village with a CC, (we got through with the 6 m box van with beads of sweat.)"

422259,3000681,5,Stuekenmatz,22/07/2023,We spent an unforgettable evening and a wonderfully quiet night here. Joshua baked us pizza in the stone oven and delicious bread for the morning. We were allowed to pick melons from the field and learned a lot about self-sufficiency. Both the journey and the dog Lola were absolutely no problem for us. Thank you dear Joshua for your hospitality and the nice evening!
422259,2998273,2,MilaAndCali,21/07/2023,"Joshua seems nice, hence two stars. However: our car was completely scratched on the way to the property, as many bushes were growing on the side. The owner's dog jumped on both sides of our car and also left scratches with her claws. In addition, she was very pushy with our dog and that's why I decided not to spend the night here."
422259,2967276,5,michelleLeblanc,15/07/2023,"A wonderful, quiet place in the middle of nature. Was received very nicely by Joshua and his dog and had a wonderful time here. Especially when snorkeling on the little-visited beach. Can only recommend this little paradise!! 10/10 points ☀️"

422321,3004644,3,propax10,22/07/2023,"The site is not bad but it is not anything special to get there. The van suffers a lot and there is a sign nearby that puts a private hunting reserve in a hurry, it is fine but nothing more."
422321,2932440,4,belugavan,07/07/2023,"Quiet wild pitch away from roads and houses. Can hear the roads in the day, but very distant. Large flat areas under the pine trees giving lots of shade. Beautiful bird song in the morning when we woke up. Track is rutted and sandy, so take care with large/ low campers. Parking can be tricky at night, but there’s loads of space."

422371,3174024,5,Fabienemma,18/08/2023,Ample parking for large and small vehicles. You will always find a place there. 18€ per day. Ideally placed for visiting Nerja. We stayed here for one night and felt completely safe. I recommend it without hesitation!

422371,3126528,3,juklian,12/08/2023,Convenient parking for visiting the center.
422371,3041696,3,anthea0101,29/07/2023,Large parking near the center. Very chaotic as they also park cars and delimited spaces are not respected. It is cheap. We parked during the day and had no problems.
422371,3029973,3,joseiglesia,27/07/2023,€18 full day. Possibility of spending the night. The downside is that there is movement of vehicles all day but we put ourselves in a corner and they did not bother us much.
422371,2949708,2,carevalo,11/07/2023,"We spent one night there, from 10 a.m. they charge you the whole day €18 throughout the night a lot of movement of people, trucks and noise, also many boys shouting to rest, I do not recommend, the only good thing is that it is close to the viewpoint of Europe"
422371,2939697,5,Orylo,09/07/2023,"The car park has an incredible location, the city center a 5-minute walk away and the best beach in Nerja, Burriana, just 650 meters away. It is an asphalt parking lot without services and for two days we paid 35 euros but it is worth it for the location."
422371,2912837,3,crisesro,01/07/2023,"You can spend the night in this car park again. It has no services, you pay for the location."
422388,3178401,4,Rocio.luna,19/08/2023,I give it a minus score because it is next to the road and there is a lot of movement of vehicles. otherwise great

422417,3266945,5,Ricondo,07/09/2023,With one of the heads that I had in the hose kit I was able to grab it without a problem. It is the closest thing you have in that area of Lisbon. It is advisable to fill up at night so as not to give out the cante because in the morning it is full of tourists.

Everything is very clean and authentic. I recommend everyone to stop there Thank you again"
422584,2931500,5,lukicuki,06/07/2023,This small Farm is a calm and a beautiful place to stay. Beatrix and her parents were really welcoming and we soon felt like being home!                       They will provide you with everything you’ll need. We recommend it a lot when you visit this area. Thank you guys. We will come back!
422584,2919708,5,Afrah,03/07/2023,"We had a very relaxing stay on this beautiful piece of land. Beatrice and her parents are open-hearted and very hospitable, with a lot of love and passion they have created a place that quickly feels like home. We felt very comfortable. A variety of activities are possible in the area, and the host also offers a lot."
422584,2916892,5,Tobi21,02/07/2023,"Very nice family who takes care of you and offers a lot! 14 euros for the parking lot and a warm shower each is fine for a private house. However, you also have to like sleeping in “strangers” in the garden."
422584,2916830,5,janxmares,02/07/2023,"Very lovely family with a nice property, chickens, birds, sheep and friendly dog, our daughter loved it. As it is in Aveiro region, count with mosquitos for the evening and our night in a tent was disturbed by barking village dogs and a rooster, but that’s the only cons we can think of. The family offers fun activities, their farm products and lunch/dinner which you can purchase extra. The communication was quick and easy. We wish them to keep their enthusiasm, they were such a warm people!"
422584,2914615,5,charini72,02/07/2023,"Spectacular without a doubt. A wonderful place. And the hosts are very very friendly and helpful. The facilities are offered for your use and are the most beautiful. You can have breakfast, dinner or whatever you want in a privileged environment. The only thing is that if you go with a large motorhome, ours is 8 meters, you have to maneuver a lot. But otherwise not five stars but ten"
422584,2911034,5,ChloeRobert,01/07/2023,"Super welcome from Pablo and his dog Nina, who got along very well with our dog. We were able to use his barbecue for our dinner, he even offered us a cucumber from the garden. Very clean toilets and showers in his house, which remains private for campers. We had breakfast, which was excellent, with products from the region."
422584,2902031,5,olli82,28/06/2023,We stood here for two nights. We received a very warm welcome. The parking space is in the back garden of the family and is super idyllic between lemon trees and the vegetable garden. The family is incredibly hospitable and super attentive. We felt more than comfortable!
422584,2901344,5,FKorzy,28/06/2023,"We had 2 very nice days and nights. Nice place to relax with a vegetable garden, sheep and birds. Beatriz, father Paulo and mother Paula received us very well and were very helpful and hospitable! Really recommended!! We will come again anyway!"
422584,2898851,5,SteveGri,27/06/2023,it was awesome. A warm and warm welcome. we experienced fishing and catamaran and it was fantastic. Beatriz could not do enough for us with lots of advice on activities to do. The parents made us feel like we were at home. Clean sanitary. The adorable dog. 5 stars without hesitation.
422584,2884701,5,Goosss,23/06/2023,"Very hospitable and friendly people, clean and complete facilities and a beautiful view of the vegetable garden and lemon trees."
422584,2873496,5,derT4Simon,20/06/2023,"We were warmly welcomed by the family. In a beautiful large garden with animals (chickens, sheep, canaries) you can spend peaceful nights. The hosts are very open and warm people who provide everything very attentive and helpful. Thank you for everything, see you next time."
422679,3245208,5,andiballi,01/09/2023,Very nice parking space with a view of Gibraltar. There are plenty of options for parking and we had a quiet night. The street nearby could not be heard.
422679,3229706,5,Paulsi96,28/08/2023,"Really great pitch, during the day there were many cars as day guests on the beach. Then at night a few buses and we. We got on well with our Fort Fiesta. Had to drive a little further inland through a barrier that was open during the day. When we wanted to drive again the next morning, the attendant simply opened the door for us. Highly recommended, definitely good for more than one night."
422679,3169878,5,MonaandLena,17/08/2023,"Best pitch ever! Further down is another huge parking space. We were there alone, it was completely quiet, clean and right on the sea. Absolute dream place!"
422679,3114553,5,guy2095,10/08/2023,"A stone's throw from the sea. The spot is really pleasant with a view of Gibraltar. It is written 2m wide and 2m high authorized, but no bar for the moment which limits access."
422732,3254098,2,poli_1111,03/09/2023,"Well located area to visit the city (one kilometer from the center), some noise to sleep due to the passage of vehicles as it is very close to the road. Giving 2 stars is for the exit ramp, since they can touch the bass of the AC, but maneuver when exiting, you have to get on the sidewalk and reverse to avoid touching. I have only seen emptying sewage next to the pay booth"
422732,3230321,1,NuestraQuerida,28/08/2023,"It does not have any type of services and the exit ramp is full of scratches from touching the rear flights and the bottom when leaving. once you enter you only have that exit left, so break your car, you have no other choice. I do not recommend it to anyone. I had to fit wooden contacts so as not to break the stabilizer legs and the rear bumper. WARNING!!"
422732,3215588,1,AdelaPortela,25/08/2023,"I am going to make my payment in the machine with a card, it does not give me a payment receipt (it is mandatory), I think that it has not been charged, and I pass it back, and they have charged me 2 times !!!! They tell me through the telephone that I give them my phone number that they will call me, NOBODY HAS CALLED ME, and I see a duplicate payment, as you will understand, I am not going to pay €30 for 24 hours, so I hope they contact me in 24 hours or I will take action."
422732,3155106,3,jauws,15/08/2023,"Parking near the center of Nerja. It offers a sewage emptying service that is poorly closed and gives off a continuous bad smell. well leveled. It's fine to spend the night because you can't find anything in all of Nerja, as long as you park far from the sewage area. It offers an agreement with a Repsol gas station to empty gray water that they neither have nor exist. Quiet zone."
422732,3155021,3,amberyl,15/08/2023,"It's not bad to sleep, well leveled and quiet, a parking lot without more. The services that it says it has are misleading, there is no agreement with the gas station and at said gas station there is no emptying of gray water. The water fill tap does not work and the black water tap is an open tank, which smells ""wonderful"""
422732,3073161,1,daviscampers,04/08/2023,"Stayed here 1 night there is a sign saying there is water but the tap doesn’t work. Very noisy also with main road next to it, dogs barking. Just a parking lot nothing special"
422732,3050784,1,AlbertoLuengo,31/07/2023,"As of 07/31/23, the faucet does not work, nor does it drain gray water or have an electricity supply. You can empty sewage and sleep calm and level. It's a parking lot, really..."
422732,2985311,1,manumarc,19/07/2023,"a simple car park, because it doesn't have water, the tap does not even have it but it doesn't work, a disaster and on top of that it puts a sign that says they are not responsible for what happens to the vehicle I do not recommend it at all"
422732,2960634,1,JesuliTrafic,13/07/2023,"A parking lot without shade, expensive by the nose, 12.40 for 6h30m with no one watching, that is, many cameras in case you break, you pay, why is there a sign that says that they are not responsible for what happens to the vehicles so they don't come back, they put it on you like a motorhome area with services and there and there is nothing at all."
422732,2941082,5,Seafire59,09/07/2023,Good quiet caravan area and close to everything interesting in nerja I will return
422732,2921086,5,pilarbernal,04/07/2023,"Parking super close to Balcón de Europa and the center of Nerja, spacious, paved and level. good rates. highly recommended!"
422732,2920072,5,descubriendoencaravana,03/07/2023,"Magnificent parking for motorhomes, 5 minutes from the center and 10 from the Balcón de Europa. Highly recommended and quiet. Ideal to know the municipality of Nerja"
422732,2894650,1,geminis,26/06/2023,"There is no area, it is a paid car park, according to the guy I spoke to on the phone, they want to condition it as an area but they don't see themselves renovating anything either. ! ATTENTION! If you take two parking spaces for your motorhome you pay double the price. we left from there. They also do not have filling or emptying services."
422732,2863592,2,rosaras,17/06/2023,very expensive to not have water service according to users.
422732,2863291,2,jackiepas,17/06/2023,"The parking is good, spacious and has a water connection. but there is no availability to change gray or black water. there is no one giving information. change the description"

the aproach road is nice, yet Big vans."
422736,2860559,4,murielriverain,16/06/2023,"ADDITION: If it's very windy, you have to go down the path far to be more sheltered from the wind and the noise of the wind turbines, the path is not very passable for many. Continuing on the cv841 towards Uncastillo, several paths seem just as pretty and more passable and far from the wind turbines!"
422777,3009277,4,cedm34,23/07/2023,pretty quiet! avenue opposite not too busy! close to the naturist beach!

423012,3067974,4,sonyapipi,03/08/2023,"The seats below are quite level. Do not try to enter the town with a van or motorhome, leave it in the parking lot. We spent the night very peacefully. The tennis club with a cafeteria is next door. Small but charming town."
423012,3024214,3,Ft,26/07/2023,"Quite quiet parking, ideal for visiting the town (the town parking is only for residents). There is a pedestrian path to the town. I stayed one night with no problem. A little inclined. The places with the least inclination are those below."
423041,3050766,1,Toker77,31/07/2023,It is forbidden to camp and spend the night since it is a protected natural field
423051,3284981,5,JavierGandal,11/09/2023,"An exceptional area, delimited spaces, Wi-Fi throughout the premises, all services, showers, toilets, washing machine and dryer. 6 m camper, €22/day with electricity. Many routes leave from here. The town store is a bit expensive but it gets you out of trouble if you are missing something, many restaurants to try the gastronomy."
423051,3281098,5,JakiHopkins,10/09/2023,"Lovely site in the centre of the village with modern and very clean facilities. 

Short walk to bars and cafes. There was a festival this weekend with music all night but still managed my longest ever sleep!! 

Ate out in local restaurant which was excellent too."
423051,3268346,5,ChakiMaisi,07/09/2023,"Beautiful site and surroundings, everything super clean, very large plots with electricity and water connections, very clean showers, sink, washing machine, dryer and the receptionist very close. The bakery is at the entrance to the area, super rich products and very friendly people. Price €18 I think is reasonable."
423051,3259366,5,Sinfo2,04/09/2023,"Good area with clean services, good location, good size plots in the center of town"
423051,3236414,5,xevifar,29/08/2023,Very good place and camping area. large and level plots. Very new and clean shower areas and toilets. €20 without light
423051,3235625,5,mica2021,29/08/2023,"Quiet and correct area. Friendly treatment from those in charge, they gave us access upon our arrival before the check-in time. Hot showers, washer and dryer, and dish sinks. Spectacular and magical place, to spend time discovering it. Without a doubt, a necessary area that provides the possibility of discovering the Natural Park, impossible to visit in any other way."
423051,3231815,5,MartindeMarte,28/08/2023,"A charming place, within the town but with views of the mountains, everything very comfortable and with a bar with a terrace. To add a drawback...lack of shadow"
423051,3213876,5,NCDMOUNTAIN,25/08/2023,"I was hesitant to put 4 stars because the price is somewhat out of position compared to other similar private areas, but, in the end, for organization, comfort, and cleanliness they deserved 5. Highly recommended."
423051,3207344,5,mbell08,23/08/2023,"It's amazing, we come by motorhome and the pitches are very good, some smaller than others for both vans and others for motorhomes. In the 20 years I've been with a motorhome it's one of the best. It lacks a bit of shade but, from what I spoke with the owner, they haven't even been open for 3 months. A little expensive in high season but worth it for the benefits it offers us."
423051,3201625,2,PacoSebastian,22/08/2023,"The setting is very pretty, but the area leaves a lot to be desired. Dust, since it is not paved, the dust is tremendous, flies in abundance and a plague of mosquitoes to top it all off. Bins always full that are not emptied, in short, very uncomfortable for what they charge. We reserved three days but the second we already left. The owners have to work much harder."
423051,3199078,2,Hectoribio,22/08/2023,"For my part I will say that it has disappointed us enough for the price it has. We had a large motorhome and the plot was small like most. If you go in a California type van it may seem big to you. The whole area is quite dry. Do not expect that in August it will be green as in the photos. No shade. The rest of the facilities are very good, for van and sleeper tourism"
423051,3196510,5,OsoPandazul,21/08/2023,"Very spacious pitches but little shade until the trees grow. Totally petfriendly, It has 3 bathrooms and 3 showers, sink area, washer and dryer. Very nice staff. I recommend going here!"

423051,3070552,5,phildrine65,03/08/2023,Pleasant site surrounded by nature. The country of the bear (museum €6 entry) a bit expensive anyway. For the rest: Night for 2 people in a van + electricity €22. Hot water showers and clean toilets. Small bar at the reception. The village is pretty. Worth the visit.
423051,3061937,5,Pauaigues,02/08/2023,"Brilliant! In the natural park it is not possible to stay overnight, but it is worth paying and staying here. The plots are huge, the site is very well cared for and it is very quiet. We were so comfortable that we stayed more nights than planned! The Camper area is surrounded by mountains and if you bring binoculars... you may see a bear! Pola de Somiedo is one of those places where you want to stay and live."

With shower service, toilets, emptied and filled with water and bar restaurant to relax with the views of the Serra de Tramuntana on the terrace, where the owners are very friendly.

(Motorhome Aire already full).Do NOT try and park here overnight. Police turned up on motorbikes just after 8pm. They insisted that we move. They said there was a notice which turned out to be across the road. Eventually agreed we could park in main beach car park as sign has been lost from there!
423210,3002200,5,sergiomave,22/07/2023,"Very quiet place with some grass and very close to the beach. Be careful because you can no longer park this weekend, everything is cordoned off to set up an event for the holidays next week."

423210,2970935,5,A.Lozano,16/07/2023,"15 minutes from Santander center, a quiet area with other vans and motorhomes. It has good views of the sea and the hermitage. At 5m there is a small beach that is also not very crowded. It does not have any kind of service, so you have to be prepared for it."

Beautiful surroundings, an amazing host (with great English) and a very clean toilette and shower. Perfect place for the one who wants to sleep in the nature under the stars only hearing the noise from birds, frogs and horses. Not too long for the ones who wants to visit beaches."

It is a quiet and clean place (let's keep it that way) Little shade for the summer, because it is difficult to park next to the scattered holm oaks."
423702,3290324,4,StefuCharly,12/09/2023,"Nice and quiet. However, many hikers come by. Breeding place for rare birds. Dogs must remain on a leash until September."
423702,3280701,5,tmorkramer,10/09/2023,Very nice and quiet parking space right by the sea. In the low season (September) there is no problem with being parked. In the morning many hikers from the Portuguese Camino pass by. Ideal for those who like to be free without supplies.
423702,3237064,4,GregetTaya,30/08/2023,"a night of calm and the sound of the waves! top, for van and converted van! a beautiful view facing the ocean! very little space on the side of the narrow road! once parked, a lane for cars and a half turn would be difficult for a large camper van! Access was limited for us, in a converted van! passing through small streets! Very pleasant walk along the beach!"
423702,3199009,5,Pipilipipaw,22/08/2023,"At the top for one night, facing the sea and next to a perfect cove to admire the sunset. Small water point but no toilets. More traffic during the day but quiet at night."

423702,3094684,4,DaviAdi85,07/08/2023,"Very nice place to spend the night, right in front of the beach. A very beautiful sunset. Be careful if your caravan is large because in the morning cars park and then it is difficult to maneuver to get out."
423702,3075572,4,lauradigi,04/08/2023,"Very nice spot. Directly on the beach and away from houses (surrounded by fields). Very quiet, sometimes some noise (tractors work in the fields at night in summer)."
423702,2970217,3,Lprs,16/07/2023,Quiet place but didn't give me a great sense of security. we spent the night here. Strange subjects roamed at sunset.
423704,3234032,5,avivseri,29/08/2023,"Really cool hippie place. There’s a lot of parking places, the people are very welcoming, if you want to eat dinner you need to let them know 2 hours before. We also joined a meditation class."
423704,3220876,4,thati,26/08/2023,"The best is the outdoor shower in the middle of nature. The community is very nice and quiet, they organize events and invite you to join them if you want. the place by car very close to Lagos. I would repeat without a doubt"
423704,3004382,2,surfndestroy,22/07/2023,"Perhaps if you have the community spirit you will feel good there but the price is not worth the service in view of the prices charged. 15 euros per night for 2 without electricity. The services are there but well hidden! A rather dodgy shower. The night was rather calm despite the dogs. Prefer the car park at the foot of the ramparts, it is more economical and better located."
423704,2957779,5,basdebruijn83,13/07/2023,"Awesome place to land for some days. Nice view to the surrounding hills, delicious drinking water and a very relax atmosphere.
The food is served by the volunteers and there is always some kind of workshop going on.
Beautiful walk around in the private forest. And everyday we take the bike to the beach.
Way much better than all the parkings in town. Silent nights. Highly recomended."

423704,2951239,1,PatricHuber,11/07/2023,"It's a hippie property. The leaders are friendly, but the property and especially the sanitary facilities are very dirty. Then rather save the money and park for free in a designated supermarket car park, such as that of Lidl."
423704,2898389,5,Fuulesack,27/06/2023,Great place with super nice people. A bit hot as there is not much shade but then you can cool off in the natural pool. I've also attended great events like Mantra Singing Night and Extatic Dance. I will gladly come again!
423704,2891240,5,BulliAlina,25/06/2023,Here you have a great community experience for the pitch! Everyone is welcoming and you immediately feel like part of the family.

423733,2978607,4,KnightBusTravel,17/07/2023,"We found it a great experience and nice to get out of the camper and chill a little around the pool or in the areas of the hotel. We stayed here for 2 days and we liked it so much that we would come again. However, there are only 4 stars instead of 5 because the manager of the hotel seems a bit upset. A little more smile wouldn't hurt. :-)"
423733,2915828,3,capitangelato,02/07/2023,"I put three stars as an ecouragement. This is not (yet) an area camper, but a hostel/airbn - with people and cars coming and going. By now (late June 2023) you can just park the van for 15 euros. No grey/black water facilities, no electricity. Extra money if you want to use toilet, shower, and swimming pool. But the location is nice and the owners too, so they might improve their offer."

The advertised spot is noted on google as a free camper parking lot, but a local made us aware that the direct neighbours would call the police on anyone parked there for the night.

423910,3291880,5,Charlie_21,13/09/2023,"Great parking lot with a wonderful sea view, but no shade, but free of charge! Close access to the most beautiful bathing bays and viewpoints in Lagos. There is a large construction site next door, and it can be assumed that this parking lot will also be integrated into the construction project at some point. But until then - just enjoy!"
423910,3291525,5,znatalia,13/09/2023,Great location close to the beach and a lot of space to park
423910,3095492,4,cambarriosb,07/08/2023,Perfect for visiting the lighthouse! Other AC parked.
423910,3060252,4,Alex139,01/08/2023,"Very well located for visiting the tip and the surrounding beaches. Very large car park, in fact, at the bottom on the left, you will not disturb anyone, even in high season. Public toilets not far, no water point."
423910,2867713,5,EspritsEnLiberte,18/06/2023,Great for visiting the tip. Plenty of seats. Parking at the back on the left is ideal so as not to disturb.

423943,3221409,4,Longshoreman,26/08/2023,"Very quiet place, there was no one on a Saturday in August, there is a river and several benches where you can sit in the shade, quite flat parking and some shaded area, there is no fountain, but a container. Pick up your trash."
423944,3291858,4,fannyhry,13/09/2023,"2 nights in this very well located campsite 2 minutes from a beach popular with surfers. 10 minutes from the center of Ericeira and all its beaches. Simple campsite 1 sanitary building few showers and few toilets for the number of holidaymakers especially during “peak hours”. Parking for camper vans with electricity, water drainage and clean water tap on each pitch. Otherwise other locations under the trees. 29.40 euros for 1 night (converted truck + motorcycle trailer + 2 people + electricity)"
423944,3282456,4,ivopolli,10/09/2023,Very nice reception and very clean washhouse as it is cleaned twice a day. Walking to the beach and town is possible. Places very dusty. But all in all good.
423944,3259112,4,SonnItaly,04/09/2023,"Excellent campsite, a little slow at reception. All included in the loading and unloading rate, hot showers. Shaded. 10/15 minute walk from the beaches. 5/10 minutes from the historic center. Market within walking distance. Advised."
423944,3247751,3,manuflus,01/09/2023,"They have closed half of the campsite this year, but there are still enough pitches. The ground is shitty but it's level. It has a barbecue area, free washing machine, and supermarket. Good location, 10 minutes walk from the town and beach right in front. There are also a couple of bars around. €44 with something for two adults with a camper without electricity for 2 days."
423944,3238824,1,SebasLozano,30/08/2023,"Despite the sympathy of the girl at the reception, a very unpleasant experience. The night shift security treated us like we were criminals. He did not want to give us electricity despite having paid for it. Even though the girl at the reception offered us an adapter, the security said no and we had to spend an hour with the van looking for an open store. Regrettable."
423944,3232378,1,francoboogie,28/08/2023,"Seats marked at reception and cannot be chosen (a strange rule that upsets users), distinguish between camper vans and motorhomes (!?), too dusty and very dirty floor, too high price (28€ 1 night, 2 people and without electricity), no wifi, occupied ghost seats (which are never really occupied), in short, an unforgettable experience! Definitely not to repeat."
423944,3201930,2,juanchito,22/08/2023,"In principle the facilities are great and very prepared. Each AC plot includes its own current, its water and even its sewage drain. Barbecues and even free washing machine. A luxury. But the ground is horrible, white, stained, dirty... You can't enjoy it like in any other campsite or area. Why that dusty floor?"
423944,3186368,4,roz26,20/08/2023,"Without reservation, parking on large motorhome parking lot, very little shade. Electric terminal + toilet emptying station + water point for each place. Sanitary block clean but few showers. Small bonus: free washing machine therefore very popular!. Small beach nearby, town 500m away. €36.40/night with electricity and 4 people."
423944,3174274,3,andretortt,18/08/2023,"Management have changed, so no longer waiting ages for doing the check in, all the rest pretty much the same (a part from new street signs). -2 stars for just one household washing machine (that was better last year with at least 2 industrial mashines)and WC for camper which is one of the worst that I saw."
423944,3146595,3,wafl,14/08/2023,"Perfect for one night and a visit to the city. Unfortunately, the place for the campers is not so nice and hardly shady. Sanitary facilities were ok."
423944,3139327,3,MECAMaju,13/08/2023,"few places for motorhomes and they are in the sun stone floor impossible to nail spikes to hold the awning, very few bathrooms, barbecues fenced in trees, with as much space as they have they could enable more shaded areas for motorhomes"
423944,3137038,2,vixxn,13/08/2023,"We paid 30€ for 2 people in the van with electricity. For us it was way too expensive compared to other campsites. It was a mess at check in, but the owner/boss (?) was incredibly friendly. The room next to the reception with Wifi was very cool, where you can work great."
423944,3133089,3,himbeerwald,12/08/2023,"In principle, a good site, if not exactly cheap: large pitches, some in the shade, well-kept common areas, good service at reception. However, you hear the road more than the sound of the sea. Super annoying: surf shop in front of the door with loud music sometimes until late in the evening."
423944,3127129,3,alegoubin,12/08/2023,Not bad. The reception is of very good quality. It's modern and clean. The location is good. On the other hand it is minimalist for the services. The places are good for the pitches really dedicated to motorhomes otherwise it is very small.
423944,3125969,1,piollox,12/08/2023,Expensive dusty and nothing next to the beach I do not recommend
423944,3115891,4,joanes,10/08/2023,"The campsite is fine and has the fair value for what they charge. Close to the beach and 4 euros in UBER to the fishermen's beach or the center. The nearby rocky beach, for surfers."
423944,3107018,4,Allard-Familly,09/08/2023,"Quiet campsite, close to the sea. The sanitary facilities are clean but few shower cabins and toilets. Do not try to book by phone. I never managed to reach them. For electrical connections, provide a good length."
423944,3101608,4,familleFLJ,08/08/2023,"Well placed campsite close to beaches and coves. For the CC there is an electrical terminal per pitch with water point and cassette emptying, only gray water emptying is done outside the pitch, enough shade, spacious and functional sanitary facilities, clean but small, i.e. 4 showers per sex, one only small free washing machine and where there is a wait, busy dusty place"
423944,3095064,4,jgordon,07/08/2023,"Very good camping for the price-quality ratio. It has all the services, good toilets, free washing machine, shaded plot. Good reception. Close to the beach, just cross. Very nice sea views. Close to the town of Ericeira by walk or bike. Some cons, like a lot of dust for being a beach campsite, and a very busy campsite."
423944,3091613,3,YannDeret,07/08/2023,"Campsite not far from the beach, access to electricity, water and sanitary facilities. very popular with surfers but a bit out of the center. 45 € for one night van with electricity, 4 people (2 adults and 2 children). Long wait at the reception, but very friendly welcome."
423944,3061971,5,tomucavan,02/08/2023,"Extraordinary campsite, sea view, great atmosphere, very helpful staff (they even received our lost suitcase) we stayed there for 2 great nights and in addition we booked for the last night so much we loved it, in short best campsite in Portugal"
423944,3048709,4,Oupahein,30/07/2023,"Friendly, efficient, helpful staff. Clean and neat site and buildings. Welcome barbecue facility. Great view. Campervan setup convenient. Well priced. Met interesting campers and shared helpful travel information."
423944,3009121,4,Camperlifevan,23/07/2023,Great place to visit Ericeira. Beaches within walking distance. Sanitary facilities clean and well maintained. Pitches are a good size with plenty of shade from pine trees. Place is dusty and a bit too expensive.
423944,3002813,3,sdeis,22/07/2023,Nice location with camping tables and bbq outside. Wc and showers old and outdated. Some youth form the camp decided to play techno music after 22.00 which was unpleasant...
423944,2999421,4,HerrWu,21/07/2023,"Large site, firm ground, approx. 50 places for campers, close to town but not too much noise, good sanitary facilities, campers & 2 adults & electricity = 28.40€"
423944,2974354,3,Marcel4485,16/07/2023,"Well located campsite, close to the beaches and the center of the city to do on foot. Secure campsite but no service (no supermarket/no snack bar/bar) Price: €48 per night for 2 adults and 2 teenagers with electricity!!!"
423944,2965153,4,DoriKa,14/07/2023,"Nice campsite, under trees, showers and toilets ok, right next to a small supermarket/gas station and surf shops, prices have been raised, paid €36 for 1 night van, dog and 4 people, several beaches nearby, town center about 30 minutes away on foot"
423944,2952258,4,Benjamindk,11/07/2023,"Nice big open space, it was safe and close to town. Telepizza and mini supermarket adjacent to the campsite. Good for services, nice showers. Some resort next to the campsite was playing very loud music until around 2am on a Saturday (they did warn us about this upon check in). It was a nice stay with everything you need easily accessible. Only downside is the very dusty ground + the price."
423944,2925100,4,leonifelix,05/07/2023,Great location for walking to Ericeira. Sanitary facilities were OK but not really the cleanest. A bit too expensive for one night.
423944,2915034,5,viajamoslibre,02/07/2023,"Good value for money. The campsite is very cool, the plots are very comfortable, the views are very beautiful. In each square you have your own electricity connection, sewage drain and water intake. The personnel is very friendly. The location is super: facing the sea, and close to the town center."
423944,2888965,5,Park4nightPortugal2k23,25/06/2023,Campsite with all amenities. The woman at the reception was very pleasant and speaks English (which is useful). The beach is really not far. Very quiet campsite the night we slept there. We highly recommend.
423944,2882456,5,elisabettabarba,23/06/2023,Slightly expensive campsite but very well maintained and clean. Oceanfront with a beautiful sunset view. A stone's throw from Ericeira.
423944,2876830,4,ChristianeRosi,21/06/2023,"Great location, close to the surf beach. Sanitary facilities in good condition, with hot water. Free choice of space, shade and sufficient distance to the neighbors. The staff was very nice and speaks English. Value for money is good."
423944,2870014,4,PhilippeNossent,19/06/2023,"Large campsite, very organized but the map is difficult to read, the toilets are OK and at the reception the young girl who greeted us spoke impeccable English. 25€ for a van and 2 people. Lots of free places (we are in mid June) not impossible that in the middle of summer it is less pleasant."
423981,3074018,5,Hoopono,04/08/2023,"Visually difficult to find. It's an extra small white cottage, along with a carport."
424079,2937830,4,mertxeolivi,08/07/2023,good place to spend the night. next to the road but covered and no noise at night. pretty flat.
424177,3030612,3,ineine,27/07/2023,We stopped to eat and rest en route in the shade. A little dusty. It helped us get out of trouble.

424201,3174216,3,JudasFCamper,18/08/2023,"That area is very good to spend the night, very quiet, but at the entrance to the Necropolis de las Aguilillas there is a sign indicating that from July to September it is forbidden to drive on that road with vehicles. I don't remember exactly what dates they were, but it is in the summer."

424240,3225685,4,Racefox,27/08/2023,Very good site but be careful about parking off the track because the sand is soft and deep! It seemed fine when we parked but in the morning we struggled a little to get out in our little Berlingo van. Stay on the track and you’ll have no trouble.
424259,3106301,5,sbescos,09/08/2023,"Quiet, pleasant place, next to a reservoir. Yes, without services. To spend one night, great."
424299,3073641,5,DLmarg,04/08/2023,Super nice place next to a road but we only saw 2 cars when we were here. 1 time a police car that looked but did not stop. Beautiful view! Perfect with the dog! Please take all your rubbish with you!
424299,3006963,5,guiriden,23/07/2023,"We are there to eat, it's perfect, a little shade under the oaks, superb view, quiet. not planned to stay there for the night but it is so comfortable that we stayed there!!! Just another nice van... If the site is full, there is the possibility of continuing 300 m on the road to the parking lot of the Ermita del Christo where there are 7/8 places (grass or stabilized or asphalt)"
424299,3006301,5,Thinoe,23/07/2023,"5 stars for the amazing view. Spent two nights here. Peaceful place. Containers a little higher, at the picnic places. Fairly windy in the evening and some flies. Passing police, no problem. A winegrower offered us a visit to his cellar, the 1st building going down, on the right."

Broom and dustpan present. ONLY accept 1 or 2€ coins; possible to change €10 NO cards and debit cards. In general the environment is not very clean, but acceptable given the price!"
424357,3089423,5,aguere,06/08/2023,"I came by motorhome and after using many laundromats, this is one of the best. Reasonable prices from €4 for 10kg of washing and the best thing is that the dryers are in increments of €1/7 minutes, with which you can adjust the drying. It has change for €10 bills."
424357,3057547,5,Antonioper3z,01/08/2023,Close to the parking lot and very good for washing clothes. Perfect washing and drying and cheaper than others I've been to in the area. I recommend it

You can bathe and take a walk to the town, which is about 20 minutes away, and buy bread (town bread of a lifetime). The ground is pretty level although we did have to shim the AC. If you go with a dog, it's great. I recommend it and we will surely return."

Bye"

The last five kilometers are on very narrow country roads, the last two of which are on a very bad unpaved road, partly very steep. So consider whether you want to expose your motorhome or caravan to this. Facilities very basic. The stay in nature and on the river (swimming or kayaking) is very pleasant."

The campsite is very close to nature and is more for people who do not need great luxury, but value a beautiful environment in the middle of nature! The equipment is very basic but authentic and lovely."

425479,3092089,5,Ribeirom,07/08/2023,We spent a very quiet night. Only three places reserved for motorhome. Change of waters new and working. Nice town on the Camino de Santiago.
425479,3058692,4,malibu140,01/08/2023,"This has to be the best village Motorhomes service facility we have encountered.  The locality had it all, walks in the forest, large picnic areas and a few local bars.  We felt safe all night."

425479,2894742,5,LizyNeyel,26/06/2023,"You have nature and a supermarket area within walking distance, the laundry is near the town hall but it does not have a sign indicating it, you have to ask the local people. The bathrooms are very clean and have everything you need. At this time the pool is free and has a changing room and showers. Quiet town with very nice trails. recommendable"
425515,3202484,1,Besiuo,22/08/2023,"Access from Cangas very very dangerous, sustained slopes of 30-45%, curves of more than 180 degrees, road width 3 meters and last 8 km unpaved. Only suitable for light 4x4. We took CaliforniaT5 and almost died trying."

425640,2972675,1,JendaKlacik,16/07/2023,"Yucky. I don't say that often, but this place is ugly and very very dirty. Basically a lot inside a giant toilet bowl. Not good for stopover. Perhaps sleeping in emergency. Only advantage it is so close to the road that you can quickly resume your journey. Any rest area will serve you better."
425640,2883597,4,Tarque,23/06/2023,"Esplanade of land, quite level. Also truck stop point. Quiet and noiseless night on weekdays. Next door is a restaurant, with good views from the terrace."

425767,3196959,5,jordanien,22/08/2023,"It is a dead end that overlooks pretty woods at daybreak. Negative point, the noise of the karting track 400 m away until midnight, the smell and the dogs barking. Positive point, the places are not delimited, you can park in the direction you want, there is no passage since it is a dead end. In the morning people arrive to park there and walk with their dog."
425767,3018012,4,RedVan77,25/07/2023,"Very quiet parking. It is a bit far from the downtown area. We spent the night in two vans and a car-tent. The mossos pass by to penalize those who are going to do crazy things with the motorcycles, but they don't say anything to the campers. To spend a perfect night, we do not need more. The previous Lidl car park that also comes out here is a real dump."

Thank you for paying attention to the toilet paper! (they sell shovels at Decathlon which allow you to bury all that) this place is great but there are plenty of others after with shade also after the bridge"

426079,3186516,3,beattrizz,20/08/2023,"Large and moderately flat parking lot, very quiet for sleeping. The only drawback I have is that if you arrive a little late, the streets to get there are quite narrow and with poorly parked cars. We went with AC 6m and it was quite difficult for us to access."
426079,3185602,5,kesku,20/08/2023,"Very quiet, at the entrance it says a painted private parking lot but it is not, you can enter without a problem, at around 8 in the afternoon the typical gorilla came charging everyone €2 for being a ""weekend"" during the week, he says that €1, of course it's all a lie, I do recommend it and knowing that if you arrive before you won't find it, and maybe not later either."

You cannot access the lower area where the access to the beach is. At most, at the beginning of the road and it is not a pretty area. Many campers and motorhomes arrived and left directly because it is not possible."
426148,3239780,5,wildehilde1994,30/08/2023,"Newly created parking lot. 5 to 10 minute walk to surf beach. The pitch gets muddy when it rains. Not recommended with a motorhome. As is often the case, dogs are unfortunately not allowed on the beach. Disappointing."
426148,3129678,4,flamencas81,12/08/2023,Perfect for spending the night in the area. Direct access to the beach to surf on a magnificent and wild beach There is room on the way for a dozen or more trucks.

Several showers and toilet houses on the promenade beach, as well as rubbish bins. But no services themselves on the area. Restaurant A Recova 2 minutes away. Great to recommend! A dreamy beach"

426369,3290784,5,BeachCoach,13/09/2023,Just a magical little spot under the oak trees. Super quiet in nature. Will use as often as we can. We didn’t see any glass or rubbish our dog had a very good time. For an on the road one night stop it was great for him.
426369,3076596,2,Leyland859,04/08/2023,Quite but lots of broken bottles and glass . Don’t visit here if you have dogs or children .

426463,3224765,3,albertulo,27/08/2023,"Bad personal experience, although it is a good place to spend the night on weekdays. At the weekend there are many rowdy bikers who flock to display their terrible exhaust pipes after 9am. (my son counted 40 motorcycles) It has tables and a potable water tap with pressure. The place is beautiful but the river water goes down a bit dirty and the big highway bridge distorts it a bit."
426617,3105933,1,paula.gbel,09/08/2023,"Location on the beach with beach shower was good. However, the people were very unfriendly and the place is in a rich area. The place is very busy, as a bicycle and pedestrian path leads directly through the spot. At 8.30 we were sent away by the police, who didn't speak a word of English, photographed our passports with their cell phones and said payment tu your casa."
426620,2969470,1,Phileas52,15/07/2023,it's not really a spot. rather a place on the side of the road. many cars and vacationers going to the palgent park all around or on the spot. difficult to park flat.
426692,3266556,4,judgdris,06/09/2023,"ATTENTION! 4x4 access only, large slippery holes even when dry prevent the passage of vehicles on both sides. We had to help a van out of there so prefer to park higher up to camp and walk down. I insist 4x4 only. Take the classic beach access path marked on Google Maps, which is much more passable as the locals don't go there. Otherwise exceptional spot!"

426692,3144279,1,gregorychris,14/08/2023,"WARNING! Very pretty spot in the middle of nature lulled by the sound of the waves. Access VERY VERY steep on one side (it passes by camper van but I will not do it twice and I could never have gone up) fortunately on the other side it is fine but there are 10 meters of big holes to pass before being on the correct path. I do not recommend unless 4x4. Sleep higher, walk down the beach is superb, wild"
426692,2936531,2,Ferdinand305,08/07/2023,"Super steep!, one-lane approach from one side, small parking lot there. If it wasn't for all the toilet corners there we would have stayed. Normal approach from the other side, but not a straight parking area. Connected by a pothole slope. Passable, but with no good feeling. 4x4 off-road vehicles have good cards, not recommended with campers! Below but fantastic pebble beach."
426745,3268733,4,Jeromeverite17,07/09/2023,"Place in the center and 200 meters from the beach, access to the city center by sea either by bike or on foot. The sanitary facilities are clean and new, the plots are XXL. The only downside is that the work on the buildings under construction is quite noisy."
426745,3243600,4,KimRuitenbeek,31/08/2023,The large area with swimming pool is closed and will be demolished. The small part next to the fair is open. Nice big pitches. Nuisance from the fair differs per evening. Lidl and beach within walking distance.

426745,3066234,1,latartanetaviajera,02/08/2023,"Everything good that this area can have is lost because it is next to an amusement park with a lot of noise and the plots attached to the attractions make it difficult to rest €25 for a campervan and 3 people do not notice the problem. You discover it at night, not recommended"
426745,3052789,4,SamuelPereira,31/07/2023,"Service area with very good physical conditions. Leveled and well divided plots. Bathrooms always clean and showers always with hot water. Dumps, water and electricity next to each plot. Next to the beach and the waterfront with restaurants and other shops. The only problem is that it is next to an amusement park. The pool was not available!?!?!? (summer), as well as the cafeteria."
426745,2999960,3,DavidTriana,22/07/2023,"The good: Parking near the beach and the restaurants on the seafront. The bad: it is between an avenue full of cars at all hours that do not let you sleep and an amusement park for screaming children where the lights dazzle you without being able to sit outside your caravan. Showers: only three, zero shade. Central, yes. Rest, no."
426745,2993049,4,PitBro,20/07/2023,"Nice, relatively new parking space with light gravel, clean sanitary facilities with everything you need for €20 including everything.

427348,3030626,5,gilomttm,27/07/2023,This place is really nice and calm. There is an amazing viewpoint really close by. The host rarely speaks english but it was not an issue as he was super helpful and friendly all the time.
427348,2933292,5,ana1685,07/07/2023,"We spent the night in Zihuatanejo, with our van, a beautiful farm, with good shade, very quiet, the owner very friendly, we will repeat without a doubt."
427348,2932775,5,pauline27396,07/07/2023,We stayed at Juanjo’s place for a night and it was super nice! Really quiet zone (except of some barking dogs) and a very pretty garden. The communication with Juanjo was easy and very friendly. We would definitely stay there again.
427376,3264062,4,GuVionTour,06/09/2023,"There were a few campers here, it was a little noisy at night. But ok for one night."
427376,3237390,5,MaxDvs,30/08/2023,"very good spot to spend a night, you have to pay but its still less than a camping

Police came at 9:30pm but they did nothing

In the morning, lots of kids and parents because of the summer camp close to the parking"
427376,3222649,4,Zafineta,26/08/2023,"good spot with lots of shade during the day. Overnight stays are allowed, but be careful not to remove tables or chairs. The campsite next door notifies the police."
427376,3167562,4,ChapiChapiador,17/08/2023,"We spent 3 nights without a problem, the ""yellows"" prohibit overnight stays, however, no sign of the police. There were between 7-8 more campers, take care of the space. All the best"
427376,3024582,3,Lalonsoa,26/07/2023,For a few days it has become paid parking. Height of 2.10m There are no showers available due to the drought in the area on any beach
427376,3002080,4,maitannie,22/07/2023,Be careful because 2 days ago they just put it on payment. they are 6.25 euros per day. It is true that the area is great but campers or large motorhomes no longer enter. They have put a warm of 2.10
427376,2983390,5,RaHzeL,18/07/2023,"Perfect spot for night, lots of shade and flat surface. 5 steps from the beach! Busy on weekends but we came on Saturday and found a spot pretty quickly…"
427376,2971262,5,uprising-dado,16/07/2023,"fantastic place practically on the beach, since 07/14/23 they have closed the entrance from which you could also enter with tall campers, now you can only enter with low vehicles, max 2.10 you can still park beyond the parking fence at 2 meters from the beach to the sun. be careful not to block the circulation though! the police pass often but if you park well they won't tell you anything!"
427376,2965317,4,oguiri,15/07/2023,"good place to sleep, with shade although be careful to park near the exit so that cars don't block you"
427376,2963649,1,JCMontejo,14/07/2023,The site is over. Today they have set the gauges at 2.10 meters. Just normal vehicles.
427376,2945457,5,Bosal62,10/07/2023,I think we took advantage of our one and only free night... Installation of parking meters in progress and certainly new barriers on this date of 10.07.2023. Too bad it was very good
427376,2932081,5,pepina34,07/07/2023,"I confirm, accessible to all sizes of vehicles. For those whose H>2.10m, enter on the beach side, there is no barrier (all the more surprising since there is one at the entrance when arriving and in addition a campsite immediately on the left). We spent 2 nights there, large shaded car park, at the foot of the beach, town center with plenty of shops 20/30 minutes away on foot, sanitary facilities nearby. Please note that the beach showers are closed this year (for now) throughout the COSTA BRAVA."
427376,2930231,5,MayR.A,06/07/2023,Very good place in front of the beach. You can't eat or have a picnic but they don't say anything because you're here overnight
427376,2925943,4,kathrischa,05/07/2023,"Nice place, right by the sea. Empty towards evening. Then it's easy to find a good spot there, but not during the day. Theoretical height restriction 2.10. But there were also larger campers there that probably just drove around outside. Police drove by but said nothing."

It is good for spending the night but not much else, there is no fountain, if there is a container, there is no bar, there is no one. I wonder if the other reviews were joking"
427619,2976722,5,ClaraBoia,17/07/2023,"Great place surrounded by nature! There's a bar, a pool and a football, basketball and tennis field, so lots of ways to keep yourself or your kids entertained!

427674,3233179,2,peppo540,29/08/2023,Very narrow path with a decent incline at the beginning. Possible with smaller vehicles. Overnight stays are prohibited (fine €249) the site is right next to apartments that enjoy the view of the sea and therefore also have an insight into the site and are happy to notify the police/regulatory office. We have chosen a place 300 meters further.
427674,3210681,5,leaxms,24/08/2023,"A really dreamy place. The view is amazing. We were there with a T6, the camper shouldn't be much wider because the road is very rocky and narrow. There are 3 different bays, one of them on the cliff, which looks a bit dangerous though."

427674,2929330,5,loudupeyron,06/07/2023,"Wonderful spot, amazing ocean view, a perfect place to have lunch outside. Be careful, the place leads you to a parallel street but you have to climb the dirt slope to get to this spot. Motorhomes do not pass, large van max."
427674,2904814,4,dachzeltreich,29/06/2023,"Nice place, but not recommended in strong winds. Great views of the western Salema beaches."

427766,2905786,5,aleexgarciia,29/06/2023,"We spent the afternoon in the La Gavia park, where we climbed and then took a walk, ate dinner in the park opposite and slept very peacefully. The next day we wanted to go to the center and a 5' walk from the car park is the Congosto metro, which taking the L1 takes us to Sol in 25'. I recommend the place if you are passing through Madrid"
427791,3093729,3,Borile,07/08/2023,"Free parking and very quiet, with sea views. It is very good to spend the night there is a bar open until late right next to it, in the morning it is closed. There are public toilets past the bar. If you arrive in the evening you will find many cars but then they leave. To find the public toilets you just have to put public toilets in the Maps, the bath houses have showers ;)"
427791,3012453,2,Paichi,24/07/2023,"The spaces are narrow for GV and AC, you end up occupying two seats, apart from the fact that the entrance/exit is narrow, if you meet another vehicle you are going to sweat cold. It is an area where people go to eat, walk and do water sports, so there is a lot of movement. I see it as ideal for parking at the last minute and leaving not too late in the morning, otherwise I do not recommend it"
427901,3066844,1,alika84,03/08/2023,no parking! you drive along a sandy road and we had to drive it backwards because turning was not possible because of the sand with a length of 6.40m) also there was construction waste and dirt everywhere. absolutely not recommended.
427916,3180606,4,Autocaravanaporelmundo,19/08/2023,"The place is fine, we spent a day and a night there, it is quiet. A 20-minute walk along a nice promenade you have Caleta de Fuste beach which has showers and toilets until 6:00 p.m. Near this place you can fish and bathe in a pool that calls itself the “Natural Pools of Caleta de Fuste”. It's fine to spend the day, but I don't know if you can take out tables or chairs."
427937,2909699,5,topo100,30/06/2023,"Very good camping, you can rest in luxury, it is worth a swim in the pool after a good walk through the surrounding paths, recommended at 100x100"

428006,3284735,5,Lou_and_Sue,11/09/2023,"Nice new place a few minutes from the stone beach (very clean water). Good care. If you come and no one is there, just choose a seat, someone will come. The sun sails provide good protection from heat, but prevent the satellite dish from starting up. The shower trays are a bad design, but you can deal with it. Can be recommended."

428006,3242331,4,LaCorza,31/08/2023,"New facilities, with all services for approximately 25 seats. It has a module with two compartments, insufficient for this capacity since they have three showers that flood due to a design error and 2 toilets each. In any case, a recommendable area and attended by a very friendly girl, but during breaks she is not always there and is open with only a sign with two telephone numbers in case of need."
428006,3221204,5,D.Mahi,26/08/2023,"Magnificent area, quiet, clean and very close to the beach. Close to bars and supermarkets. At 10.20 the local baker arrives with very good quality products. Highly recommended for stays of 2-3 days. If you go in summer, take your diving goggles, in the crystal clear water you can see a lot of fish. The girl who served us was very friendly and willing to help. We will definitely be back."
428006,3219527,4,Silsant,26/08/2023,"Recommended 100%!! Some friends recommended it to us and the truth is that we were delighted. Clean bathrooms, spacious plots, good location, beautiful and not crowded town, and lovely Tania. we will be back for sure!"

Very nice neighborhood with beautiful seafront walks. 20 euros per night with electricity 4 people and 1 dog"
428006,3186832,5,Urko,20/08/2023,"Area with its heads and tails. Tania's kindness and predisposition is ten. All squares with light, water intake, even drainage. On the other hand, the distribution of some places makes their use practically impossible under normal conditions. Its managers should consider opening some places that are impractical, for example number 5 The floor of the showers is very dangerous due to the water outside"
428006,3184553,5,martasa93,20/08/2023,"Highly recommended, Tania, the super friendly girl, the area is luxurious, everything is quiet and very clean, the downside is that the bathrooms flood and there are few for everyone."

To disconnect for a few days with the beach 2 minutes away, and several beach bars, you don't have to ask for more. Recommended and would spend a few days again if we return to the area."
428006,3130476,2,GemaLB,12/08/2023,"If what you are looking for is tranquility and rest, you will not find it in summer. The area is on a busy street and has constant noise that disturbs sleep both during the day and at night."

The owners are very friendly and helpful, you feel at home. We have bought Albariño wine from their own harvest and eggs from their chickens. We will certainly repeat !!"
428014,2998369,5,AlfonsoM,21/07/2023,"The place is great, the family is super welcoming. Highly recommended and well connected. The bathrooms are the best. It is easy to get to, although there is a small, somewhat narrow slope along the national road. The overnight is from €12"
428014,2962794,5,TheMintBus,14/07/2023,"Great place with nice, personable operators. Everything is brand new. In the middle of the vines with chickens and dogs. There is the possibility to buy local products. We felt very comfortable! Thanks very much!"
428014,2962255,5,LottekeBoogert,14/07/2023,"Fantastic place with luxurious sanitary facilities. Even two washing machines and a dryer. The owners are sweet, warm people. You can sleep with a view of the vineyard and a 5-minute walk away is a beautiful lagoon where you can swim. There are also many attractions nearby. The place was still under construction when we were there, but it already felt very complete."
428014,2947969,5,derpaderborner,10/07/2023,"Old farm that is being converted into a campsite. In an idyllic location with grapevines, chickens and its own vegetable garden. Washroom and bathrooms are brand new, water and electrics work great. The owners are super nice and provided me with eggs and fresh vegetables when I left. Great recommendation!"
428014,2943294,5,DAVIDSUNTERRA-ENERGY,09/07/2023,"Very good communication with the highway, along with wonderful surroundings and excellent services. All at very good prices. I recommend this place to park your caravan and be with your family."

428080,3237580,4,BuYuBu,30/08/2023,Hello! We have parked and spent the night on this street without problems. There is quite a lot of traffic. Next to a small park to walk our dogs.
428104,3083741,1,johnsito,05/08/2023,Don't even think about going down with a big van. You will scratch your feet everywhere and getting out was an adventure.
428104,2909161,4,parknightasa,30/06/2023,The best access is through a lane in good condition that starts on the left 100m from the exit of the town towards Barrios. The entrance from the town is steep and the area on the left bank is not that wide. It lacks services but is very clean.
428107,3237077,5,Marcelinomar,30/08/2023,"I do not recommend leaving the motorhome alone in this place. We went for a half-hour walk to the shopping center and a man driving a full-size Adriá was trying to steal the tarp that covers the bicycles. Why did the rest have padlocks, or I suppose they would also disappear. In broad daylight."
428107,3043467,5,compicampers,30/07/2023,"Very quiet place to sleep, there were more motorhomes and campers, there is no parking problem, there are many free places. 5 minutes from the park."
428107,2989952,2,juanmaelsa,19/07/2023,"The place to sleep is fine, but if you go to the park, take the motorhome to the parking lot of the park, we had been robbed when we returned."
428107,2909157,5,Estre,30/06/2023,Very quiet place and next to the adventure good place to spend one or more nights
428139,3203810,4,gabin31,23/08/2023,Superb view we were alone and it was very pleasant. Regrettable that there are so many mosquitoes and so little respect for nature...
428139,3080128,4,AudreyRusseil,05/08/2023,Very nice place along the rocky cliffs to sleep and see a magnificent sunset. A few flat places to park along this dirt road. The road is far enough not to disturb. near Barge! No convenience.
428175,3153275,1,ValenciaBeni,15/08/2023,if you are looking for shade better NOT come
428204,3244027,3,dadri,31/08/2023,"We spent an afternoon at the site, good views of the river and the bridge, an area where people walk along the route, the dirt parking area is medium-sized and there are usually fishermen's cars (I estimate that about 4-5 cars enter, leaving quite a lot place between them)."
428204,3066006,4,arjanx,02/08/2023,"Beautiful view, regular fishermen and lots of mosquitoes"
428283,3255831,4,mlueders,04/09/2023,"Good, paved parking lot where you can easily find a spot for the night. It is very quiet and you can be at a viewing point in 2 minutes. Falesia beach is just 10 minutes walk away."

428283,3210231,4,cesoleil,24/08/2023,We slept in the large parking lot. The night was relatively calm. Close to the ocean and a beautiful view. The parking lot is filled until quite late and cars arrive quite early in the morning.
428283,3196723,1,caravanas75,21/08/2023,Good evening. It is not allowed to park anymore. GNR!!!
428283,3157953,5,mariaJoNi,16/08/2023,"We spent one night, quiet without any noise, the truth is that the parking lot is very good, and a little further away going up a little path leads to a cliff that you can see the entire beach of Praia da Falésia, super beautiful"
428283,3149966,4,park1234GA,15/08/2023,Nice spot. We parked in the big park close to the sandy one because it was not accessible. Quiet and close to the beach. Pay attention not to enter in the sandy one !
428283,3104175,4,Kennysrk,08/08/2023,"Good spot, we spent one night. Lots of vans in this month of August so there is not room for everyone in this month of August but there is still a large parking lot just in front to accommodate everyone. If your van is over 3m it will not pass under trees either. Only negative point, many dogs in the surrounding properties barking."
428283,3101763,2,Michoco1214,08/08/2023,"It is a very quiet area where there were several ACs, specifically the paved parking lot at the end of the street was where we stopped. Unfortunately we had to leave because there was a dog that did not stop barking all night. Not suitable for light sleepers!!"
428283,3080648,5,isagredo,05/08/2023,Wonderful shady place to spend the day and night. Difficult to access but we passed with a Ducato without problem.
428283,3077530,4,LiseThibault,04/08/2023,"Very good spot for a sunset. Do not hesitate to go as far as possible in the parking lot (just before the private property). Only downside quite noisy night, a nightclub where a party not far. Don't forget to pick up your trash."
428283,3076665,5,jorge_calvo4,04/08/2023,"Good parking for the night, quiet and we spent the night with two caravans."

428283,3044703,4,kalier,30/07/2023,"We spent a very quiet night, there are many shady places and the beach is very close and beautiful. The only drawback are the accesses to the parking lot, be careful with the low ones. It has a lot of garbage."
428283,3043040,5,pomonaNL,30/07/2023,"The application has not allowed me to create a new site because we are very close. DO NOT enter the sandy roads, it is very easy to brush the bottom, difficult to turn and get out, especially if it is very crowded. In the little street from before (Infante don Henrique) there is a cement parking lot, free, flat, and very quiet, where you can sleep and go for a walk to the beach without getting scared. We have slept several caravans and camper."
428283,3026838,4,mariondesk,27/07/2023,"Very pleasant spot in the shade with a magnificent view of the cliff and sunset behind the buildings of Albufeira, on the other hand, a place left very dirty by campers and beachgoers. Please pick up your trash before this place is closed to vans and CCs. The police come from time to time and tolerate camping but without installation (canvas, tents, etc.)"
428283,3001528,4,Bolzen,22/07/2023,Pleasant night in the shade. Filled with tourists during the day. Large motorhomes are probably better parked on the paved area.
428283,2990083,4,lisaFresia,20/07/2023,"the path was a bit bumpy, but possible with a small camper. Stood under a tree in the shade. The night was pleasant, only a few dogs barked loudly. the way to the beach is also not far."
428283,2961845,5,gra_gp,14/07/2023,"We have spent a very quiet and cool night. Safe place, good neighborhood. To access the car park DO NOT go up the bumpy slope, there are two alternatives right next to it. The sunset and sunrise of this beautiful beach."

428556,3080037,4,Diablo666,05/08/2023,"very quiet place ... good spot for a sunset. Be careful with maps that take you through a path that is supposed to lead to the back of the spot, but the terrain is not very passable and above all it is a dead end! go through Carrer del Castillo"

428580,3091170,1,martiu_re,06/08/2023,To get there it was a fairly steep goat path. We didn't get to the site because the Camper we brought is too big to put it there. the path may be easier later but we have not dared to check it to spend only one night.

428586,3160556,1,chiara1802,16/08/2023,"Don't park here, it would also be a good place (even if it's a dirt road) only that there are shady and very grumpy people who want to let you park. If you don't do as they say and leave, they'll follow you into the street too. It's definitely not a safe place."
428586,3099152,1,horspub,08/08/2023,Car park to flee. Dirty place. Strange people are prowling the parking lot. Not secure despite appearance. Unstable sandy ground. Otherwise pretty good location just in front of the beach and in the town. Strange not to have a positive comment.
428597,3261169,5,AlinaNeubert,05/09/2023,"Nice place, with a few shaded areas under the palm trees. Some other campers were there too. The street can be heard a bit, but still really quiet. We stayed overnight and felt very safe. Five minutes from the beach."
428597,3037232,4,eldelacajita,29/07/2023,"We only stopped for a walk to the beach. There are no specific spaces for motorhomes, but the strip parallel to the Avinguda de la Serra d'Aitana borders a garden, so you can stick to the bottom by parking with your back to it."

The location is unfortunately used a lot by young people who leave all their trash there. I had to clean the place before I could enjoy it….. A full trash bag!! unbelievable... Anyhow. When clean, the spot is perfect!"
428611,2961328,4,RebeccaVICTOR,14/07/2023,Great place! Passage of the GNR this morning at 8 am. No fine but a notification (taking information on our identity card and photo of the vehicle plate) Forbidden to sleep here because it is a natural park (from Sagres to Sines it is forbidden to park to sleep on the coast)
428796,2973504,3,Rubao_europa,16/07/2023,Easy access and parking is right outside the castle. Small but busy parking lot.

428864,3197355,2,JJ14,22/08/2023,"We decided to stay the night because the place is nice and the town is really pretty. But during the afternoon, and throughout the night, the smell of the pig farm was unbearable. I'm surprised no comment has mentioned this."
428864,3191131,4,AlbertBasku,21/08/2023,"Very good place. Fairly level and with lots of places. Prior reservation is required, free of charge, although no one asked us to do so. There is a highly recommended pizza food truck very close by. Containers can only be opened during certain hours."
428864,3170349,4,TheBigMamaVan,17/08/2023,Very good place!! Pity about the containers that go with code and the shadow. The food truck makes delicious pizzas! We will repeat!

428864,2972013,5,MaripazRequena,16/07/2023,"Quiet place, the only drawback is that at the moment there is no shade, as the comments on the food truck say, they make very good pizzas and if it is Saturday there is a DJ playing music. Without services and to use the garbage containers you need the QR of the reservation. There is a toilet at the information point at the entrance."

We will be back, that's for sure!!!!"
429377,2948166,5,gelutu,10/07/2023,"Very good motorhome area, all new and impeccable, exemplary treatment from the owners, views of the estuary and an impressive sunset. Thanks we will be back for sure"
429377,2943243,5,aitamd,09/07/2023,"Brand new and very clean facilities. Free cold bath and shower, hot with coins. Free filling and emptying. They applied to us, without knowing her, the opening promotion of a free night. The staff is super friendly. Beach 5 minutes away, with a good slope, yes. We will repeat without a doubt"
429377,2933930,5,pozilun,07/07/2023,"Nice and quiet place. supermarket nearby and beaches too. We have taken advantage of the free welcome night of the month of July. Thanks Beni. It has some things to improve but it's recently opened so it's normal. The views of the estuary are beautiful. Electricity in all plots and water (I wish they all also had drains, it would be at the most). We will be back."
429377,2933543,5,glamysfamily,07/07/2023,"Impeccable newly opened camper area. Unbeatable location with beautiful views and close to the beach. Exquisite treatment by Beni and Fernando. Fully equipped with everything you need for motorhomes. Showers, toilets, washer and dryer, cafeteria, video surveillance, plots with water and electricity and a very good price. We will be back!!!"
429377,2931015,5,NuriaCarbayin,06/07/2023,"Recently inaugurated area, with all services (toilets, showers, cafeteria, laundry, loading and unloading of water and electricity) and spectacular views. A few meters from the beach, you can walk. 13 minute walk from the Portosin restaurant area. Beni and Fernando are super attentive, with tourism information in the area. We will be back."
429377,2928806,5,LinduxR.,06/07/2023,"A very new beautifully landscaped pitch with exceptional views. about 50 pitches, all slightly crooked, but no problem. Operators are very nice. showers and toilets very clean."
429377,2926069,5,JordiSilver,05/07/2023,"Recently inaugurated private area made with love. Incredible views. Unbeatable treatment. With all the necessary services, including a washing machine. Wide squares where you can take out chairs, table and awnings. To repeat without a doubt!"
429396,3292659,5,kuumiut,13/09/2023,simply extra! It's hard to get closer to the sea! Little traffic and it's the sea we're looking at anyway
429396,3217030,4,journeyfromthemiddle,25/08/2023,You can not beat this view. Reasonably level. Just sound of waves on the rocks. Many walkers go by.  As close to the sea as you can be.  Able to put out an awning and chairs.  Locals come at night to fish.  Bins (recycle and general) though no other services.  Not busy during our visit.
429396,3202327,5,Giuliafreedogs,22/08/2023,Beautiful place!!!
429396,3185604,5,Ary38,20/08/2023,"A great place with your feet in the water! Very quiet night, several locations along the bike path."

429396,3040455,4,JeromeJonckheere,29/07/2023,Very nice sea view! possibility of swimming and close to some facilities we still preferred to do 1km more to get away from the sound of the waves which was very strong at this place. there is a small dirt parking lot popular with surfers (we had to wait for them to leave to get a spot)
429403,3147784,1,ednatm,14/08/2023,Inaccessible because of a festival.

429403,3022785,5,CarmonerosPorelMundo,26/07/2023,"Fantastic place to spend the night. little noisy and quiet. there are many ACs, in front of a park with water and very clean public toilets. The police came by and told us that we could only stay for 48 hours. to visit Lisbon you can safely leave and take two buses to the center. beach very close."
429403,3012193,4,jarty,24/07/2023,"The place is great to park and spend the night, it is right next to the beach and in front of a park, ideal for children and for sports. To rest you have to park as far away as possible from the bar that is located on the left side of the park, and they usually play music until late. In the same street there is a dead end area and it is the best part to sleep or in the middle of the street."
429403,2930803,5,xini,06/07/2023,"Everything is great! Ideal area to go to the beach and if you go with children, a very good area because there is a huge park with 3 parks inside for children. The only drawback is that if you park very close to the beach there is music at night in a kind of disco, so I would recommend parking on the farthest side of the beach. We were there for more than one day and everything was perfect."
429403,2922612,5,DennisDriel,04/07/2023,"amazing, we spent a quiet night, close to the beach, and in the morning the children played in the free Park"

429420,3174495,5,laurasi,18/08/2023,"Great. Place to stop and refill food, water and empty, easy to get to in large van. And the supermarket had sausages, which is my children’s favourite."
429420,3158304,5,mongolfiera,16/08/2023,A place that we would all like to find. Gray and black water loading and unloading present. New and clean toilets. convenient for shopping. Thanks Eroski

429420,3050282,5,teatea,31/07/2023,"On the road between Finisterre and La Coruna, very comfortable and very clean for loading and unloading. In addition, you can go shopping in the adjacent supermarket!"
429420,3026882,2,geluman,27/07/2023,"At night the parking lot remains closed since it belongs to an establishment and it will only open during business hours. We went to spend the night and we had to go to the Carabanas del Pieblo area, which is very well signposted and cared for (a good town to spend a day )"
429420,3002196,5,BraviaCamper,22/07/2023,Perfect place for supplies and disposal. Very clean toilets right next to it. In Eroski you can get everything you need for shopping. Muchas gracias Eroski.

429421,3247243,5,MathildeCC,01/09/2023,"A true corner of paradise, a haven of peace. We had a very quiet night. View of the estuary, the ocean in the distance. Many birds. A very flat place. Tranquility assured."
429441,3281203,5,Agust1960,10/09/2023,Spectacular area designed for Cars. Black water and drains...the gray ones can only be used with buckets Near the beach. you can drink coffee in the xiringo. Fantastic to take a break... or stay depending on the weather.
429441,3274216,4,aranxa16,08/09/2023,"Very good area, right at the Lariño lighthouse. There are several places. It has water filling and potty emptying for every two spaces. The negative part is that if they unload the potty you get the smell."
429441,3260439,1,swissroger,05/09/2023,What thinking mind has it occurred to not install a gray water drain? The person who designed this has certainly not traveled in a van in his life…
429441,3257487,3,UNAVIDACAMPER,04/09/2023,"The area is very beautiful and is in an idyllic location. It would be important for there to be more places since it is full and we could not find the supposed emptying space. Of course, we filled water without a problem. Presumably there is an electrical outlet but it doesn't work. We didn't stay the night, we just ate there, filled water and emptied the pee tank, but they told us there were a lot of mosquitoes (August)"
429441,3254585,3,raulsinho,03/09/2023,"Example of waste of public money. Some privileged mind decided to put threaded inlets and sewage drains for every two seats... but they decided to put the taps for refilling clean water with a button on the back. Without sense. You cannot discharge gray water, there is NO grate on the floor for gray water."
429441,3227458,1,iferrero,27/08/2023,"We understand that it is only for motorhomes, not vans. we left the place is very beautiful."
429441,3210734,4,ruben19mp,24/08/2023,"The location is idyllic, next to the beach and the lighthouse (with hotel and tavern). There is a public paddle tennis court and it is very well maintained. We went on a cloudy day and there were plenty of free places. You need an adapter for clean water. The electrical connection was not working"
429441,3207917,5,cassou40,23/08/2023,"Very nice location, ideally placed with all amenities. The beach is a few meters ... fabulous!"
429441,3199464,5,8574VanToR,22/08/2023,Great parking and nice view of the lighthouse and the bay. Nearby beach with showers on the wooden walkway. Quiet night without noise. The grays can only be downloaded with a tube (available for sharing).
429441,3182551,1,miguelq79,19/08/2023,"Beware of the local Police, they have their business here, they don't let you stop or wait for a place, having to leave the place without being able to refill water, they threaten you with a €200 fine"
429441,3169263,5,munkas,17/08/2023,"This AC area is perfect! New, clean, next to the lighthouse and the beach, a very quiet place. It is recommended to have a hose with a screw-in mouth for the taps that are here. Free area and highly recommended. I don't understand negative comments, the site is great."
429441,3140086,1,dekapax,13/08/2023,"The municipal authorities insist that you can only park in the marked spaces that the rest of the area, even if it seems like it, is not for parking and that IF THEY DO FINE a star because the parking area clearly seems to be a tax collector"
429441,3130042,1,beccyanddan,12/08/2023,Same tap to fill drinking water & flush black water….. no thanks…. And no clear grey drainage. New area that’s been badly designed. No more than a parking spot to dump black water
429441,3123743,1,LARANDONVOYAGE,11/08/2023,"It is a shame that cars or vans are considered housing and occupy a space and I cannot park with an Ac of 7 m and if I park outside the square, according to what the police say, a fine, when they have a parking lot in front, we left without hesitation."
429441,3122166,5,tiomiky,11/08/2023,"Fantastic area, only one downside, you can't stay out of the squares, the local police fine €200. The emptying is done with a drain hose to share among all who are there. The baker comes every morning and brings bread, empanadas, pastries... all delicious and very well priced. The views of the lighthouse are spectacular."
429441,3114145,2,Abelarra,10/08/2023,"Free area and very poorly designed where you can empty sewage and refuel water from a single key to clean the cassette. every two plots. NOTE, the municipal police have just passed sanctioning those who are outside the assigned plots"
429441,3094910,4,Melala,07/08/2023,"Free area with possibility of draining used water, drinking water. Electricity does not work. Mosquito and fly. In front of the sea."
429441,3081374,5,Bluesky22,05/08/2023,Thank you to the municipality of Carnota for this magnificent place. An extraordinary place at the water's edge with everything you need.
429441,3076683,3,herve34,04/08/2023,"Very recent area in a quiet location, with a beautiful beach. There are 10 level pitches on hard ground, with a water point and drain every 2 plots. But it's not a good idea to dump gray and black water on the site. Attention also only 11 motorhomes on the authorized area, not one more, the police are watching. Otherwise the site is superb."
429441,3072209,4,gabla,03/08/2023,"First of all: in the summer of 23 it's a really great place. a beautiful beach in the south and good, previously free parking spaces. The idea of creating a supply and disposal station for every two pitches suggests that higher-priced marketing is planned. In any case, these stations are unfortunate planned or built. There is no central gray water disposal. Still top!"
429441,3070387,1,DanielMolina,03/08/2023,"Great if you arrive and find a place. Complicated in summer. The services are individual, so you cannot use them."
429441,3046207,4,mplcardoso,30/07/2023,Excellent and spacious place for 10 motorhomes. There was nowhere to empty the gray waters. Electricity was not working. It has a tennis court. Pets are not allowed on the south beach. To the north there are more stones but there is the (mini) beach of Joana with a little bit of sand.
429441,3035605,5,abartig,28/07/2023,Beautiful place with 11 spots to park. There is per 2 places fresh water and greywater possibility. Greywater is a bit tricky because you need a tube or a bucket. But overall you even have a tennis court and a space to rest.
429441,3020010,3,UNAVIDACAMPER,25/07/2023,"We spent some time during the day, since we needed to fill water, the water is free and there is also emptying of sewage. Supposedly there is electrical connection but the people who were there said it didn't work :) Being in an open place it was very windy and they said a lot of mosquitoes :("
429441,2995044,3,RubenMekanikal,21/07/2023,"Good views, wide and level squares, beach nearby, bar and beach bar, visit a great baker... It doesn't have to empty grey, bad smells from the sewage drain, mosquitoes riddled us throughout the night..."
429441,2977561,4,CasasAcuna,17/07/2023,"Spectacular area of recent creation. Only 10 places. As they say in other comments, the emptying of gray is badly designed and has to be done either with a drain hose or with buckets... BEWARE!!! Do not park in the area outside the marked spaces (there are 10). This morning the Carnota local passed by and fined the motorhomes that were parked in the compound outside the squares (they were occupied). Without warning"
429441,2976819,5,jssc,17/07/2023,"Incredible place, services, tranquility and spectacular views. Around 9:30 a.m. the baker comes by with bread, pastries and empanadas. Be careful not to stay outside the squares (11) first thing in the morning the local police pass by to take photos of those who are outside and report them."
429441,2972076,3,conserlians,16/07/2023,"The site is very good, but the electricity does not work. the views and the sunsets, fantastic"
429441,2965075,5,mecanicomachine,14/07/2023,"The area is in a privileged site. completely flat and one step away from the sea. This morning the baker showed up around 10 in the morning in the area. A more than pleasant surprise. The only drawback, the way they have distributed the water discharge loading area, not very accessible if the area is full."
429441,2960444,4,Hannedr,13/07/2023,"A beautiful location, very peaceful. However, it is not entirely clear how the service station works in terms of gray water discharge. PLEASE NOTE: only park on the 11 official pitches, the police come by several times a day to send away and/or fine motorhomes parked next to them. The baker passes by every day."
429441,2949390,4,guevyto,11/07/2023,"Spectacular area with a beach, several places to have a drink, to put some trouble, who designed the area did not design the evacuation of gray water, I called the town hall and an operator came to confirm that there is no grid as such, the option we have is either buckets as I did or hook a hose to the drain and discharge into the sewer from the faucet, that is one position for every two seats, Max 11."
429441,2944776,4,SHRey,10/07/2023,"First of all, I thank the council for having built this infrastructure. It has 10 delimited spaces with all the services in each one of them. The taps have been changed, the key and screw one is for the black ones and the pressure and smooth one for the clean ones. They must set a time limit so they don't turn it into a settlement, which is already starting to happen. Please let's take care of this area."
429441,2937291,4,ZequiCasas,08/07/2023,"Just released in Jul 2023, next to paddle tennis courts and Faro de Lariño. Good location and good paved access, even for large motorhomes. The area is perfectly level and has all the services (electricity still does not work). There is a hotel and a tavern in the same lighthouse and a bar 100 m away (people from the land very open, well priced). We have stayed overnight and perfect. It has 10-12 seats"
429503,3242273,4,Juankiki,31/08/2023,"Very shady place due to its abundant pine trees, plenty of parking spaces, most of them flat. Camping and road nearby, somewhat noisy at night. Not far from the town and the beaches."
429503,3220038,3,Vandredi_off,26/08/2023,"This car park is a good option for one night if you want to be close to Pals and its beaches. it is next to a very busy road so it is noisy. be careful the entrance is complicated to access because of a hole, many vehicles hit. it is quite dirty with rubbish and toilet paper. however it is well shaded and there are quite a few flat pitches. it helps!"
429503,3164249,5,MrJaunius,17/08/2023,We stayed there for one night. There is a camping ground across the road so you are likely to hear music and kids screaming until 11pm. However after midnight it is very quiet. The walk to the beach is only 10min. There is a supermarket across the road (1min walk). Not that easy to park with a bigger vehicle (6.95m length van we had) but possible.
429503,2940356,4,Oscarbf,09/07/2023,It is a pine forest so there is a lot of shade but with a certain unevenness. We slept without problem. It is next to the main road so there is continuous passage of cars. That's the only reason I don't give it 5 stars.
429617,3141539,4,lesstouaibiza,14/08/2023,Quiet and away from the city. Very nice view when you wake up. Watch out for mosquitoes!!! Despite the product we were eaten all night we did not sleep well...
429617,3085376,5,brusselsyogini,06/08/2023,"It’s actually a big parking in a residential area, I tought it was full from the street but there was more space if you enter. Very chill neighbourhood atmosphere, the view is very nice, we could sleep in disturbed but it is still the city, so there was a big party in the city in front of us and there were some car movements at nights. Nice restaurant with a pool nearby!"

429620,2930409,5,antrova,06/07/2023,"It has no services, it is full of nature, but it is close to the beach by car, or by walking on a footbridge that leads to the highway. The beach is a 5-minute walk away, passing the walkway along Cervantes Avenue."

The bathrooms are clean and numerous, a good atmosphere, a lot of Vans. Next to Lariño beach, which is wonderful. We had dinner at the restaurant, everything was very tasty! We hope to return!"
429658,3199603,5,JuRL,22/08/2023,"Magnificent feeling at the end of the world in this simple and welcoming campsite, lulled by the sound of the waves. Plan to arrive not too late to get a pitch with an ocean view."

429658,2991636,5,Mira2804,20/07/2023,Beautifully located campsite with enough shade. About 5 minutes to the beach. Enough showers and toilets that are cleaned regularly. 25 euros per night for a camper and 2 people
429658,2987983,5,cellovandammo,19/07/2023,Very nice campsite! We planned to stay one night. It became three. Be sure to walk down to enjoy the clear water.

429658,2970122,4,annie.lb,16/07/2023,"Nice grassy campsite with hot showers! A restaurant is on-site and the reception has a small area selling some groceries. Quite a few plots have beautiful ocean views. Slightly pricey: 29,50€ for 2 adults with electricity."
429658,2966821,5,annsinlangdale,15/07/2023,Lovely campsite between two lovely white sand long dune’s beaches . Very clean facilities and well maintained pitches on site or in a small field. Both with sea views. A nice restaurant with another on the coast 100m away. Handy for Muros and the other small villages. £58Euro two people two nights with electricity.VW T6.1.
429658,2933882,3,wilkescheers,07/07/2023,Attention: No dogs allowed on the campsite. So we had to turn back and have no further experience with spending the night there.
429687,2961491,4,luscious,14/07/2023,"Nice spot for passing through. Pine trees give great shade. Spot is right next to a garbage collection point — and got unlucky that a garbage truck came by for pickup at 2am . public toilets are on the same side of the bridge, past the playground on the right."

Today around 9am the civil guard passed by saying that you can park, but it is prohibited to camp and spend the night (""as everyone is doing"" the guard said) throughout the municipality of Llanes. They have not told us anything about a fine, I hope they have not fined"
429825,3265216,1,munchydragon,06/09/2023,"It is really to go in a small/compact VW4 type van. If not, no matter how promising the place may seem, don't make an effort (we with a Mercedes Sprinter didn't even go through Niembru, also for fear of getting stuck). I would recommend either going on foot or looking for other beaches, Asturias has a lot to offer ;) good luck!"
429825,3258967,5,melalove,04/09/2023,The site is superb and spacious. You can choose either the mountain view or the sea view when you wake up. Trash cans have even been placed at the entrance.

429825,3170360,5,miripm,17/08/2023,"The road to get there is very complicated if you have a large vehicle, I don't think a caravan will pass through the streets of the town. First there is a small parking lot at the beach viewpoint, but if you go up to the end there is a clearing with plenty of spaces. There are many cows and it is very quiet, you could spend the night without any problem."
429825,3169175,4,sucioinsincero,17/08/2023,"bad access. Spectacular views, flat and wide"
429825,3163830,5,aleessp,17/08/2023,"It is a parking lot of 10! A large esplanade that can accommodate a multitude of vehicles. The views are spectacular, there are cows all around and the beach next to it is beautiful. We camped without problem, the terrain is flat. During the day it is usually quite crowded, but for the night it is ideal."
429825,3159238,4,furguito,16/08/2023,"very wide esplanade with many holes and with direct access to the beach, after doing the 1.7km path without shortcuts, if by chance you take the shortcut and not where the cars go, you know that it is complicated, especially to go with children. The bad thing about this car park is the power line just above it, which spoils the natural environment. Good mountain views and a lot of wind."
429825,3158169,5,Neburramora,16/08/2023,"Super spacious space with beautiful views, ideal for going down to the beach the next day. Les vaques in the prau right next door give it a special touch. The ground is more level in some areas than in others, it is trying to find a good place. Of course, only suitable for campers! To go up Niembru you go through very narrow and sloping streets, a large AC would have problems."
429825,3154279,5,yagotisner,15/08/2023,"Very good place both to park during the day and go to the beach (one of our favorites in Asturias) and to spend the night, brutal views between the sea and the mountains, you will sleep accompanied by other campers and caravans .. highly recommended !! the climb through the town a little narrow"

429825,3149324,5,trastonetat5,15/08/2023,A huge esplanade of grass at the top of the mountain. Many cars and vans fit. Very good views and camping atmosphere. We have had a pleasant stay. Access to the beach by a path not suitable for beginners.
429825,3140662,5,albert_van10,13/08/2023,"A large car park with many vans. Very good atmosphere. To get there you have to go through VERY narrow streets, don't go there with very big vans! You can leave your car there and go to Torimbia beach (in fact it is the car park to go there). During the day (in August) everything is full, and at night there is room!"
429825,3137016,5,AndrewMackay,13/08/2023,"Crazy spot, we spent the night next to the sea with tons of other vans. The road goes through a village with tight streets, only suitable for medium sized vans. I would avoid going at around dinner time since people start returning from the beach and the road can get chaotic. Please leave the spot clean."
429825,3114084,4,valen_rt,10/08/2023,"No big motorhomes!! the only way to get there is through the town and the streets are very narrow, you cannot pass or go back. There is an old sign when entering the town that says motorhomes are prohibited."

429825,3105121,5,VeroNos,09/08/2023,Indeed the car park is a bit complicated to access (very narrow and steep roads). But the view is breathtaking.
429825,3101949,3,Spildy,08/08/2023,"Beautiful spot with a view on mountains and sea, we spent pretty calm night, but it was really windy. To access the beach take the road for cars, because the road that is from the parking is very steep with bad terrain . Back we took the road from the other side of the beach and then there’s a shortcut to the parking but through thorn bushes, so take the original road."
429825,3098527,5,gircuri,08/08/2023,Place with beautiful views! Mountain and sea! Quiet and big. Road access is narrow.

429825,3072031,5,llromeu,03/08/2023,"Spectacular!!! Complicated path, you have to cross the village of Niembro, which is very narrow, and climb a steep path. Is it worth it."
429825,3071881,4,jenlin5,03/08/2023,Free parking space. We spent a good night there. Unfortunately no toilets nearby. The way up through the village is a bit narrow. But definitely worth it. Nice hiking area

PS: we went back two days later: police came in the morning: they tolerate people sleeping in vans, but no tables, chairs, awning, tents are allowed."
429825,3037669,5,Alvarien,29/07/2023,Free parking and quite flat with spectacular views on both sides. To get here you have to cross the narrow streets of the town. ACs don't fit. Worth.

429825,3018066,5,Patatitas,25/07/2023,"We went with a camper van. We spent the night there and it was a wonderful experience. A magical sunset and a quiet night, we were able to have breakfast with the cows grazing next to it. Things to keep in mind: VERY narrow access, impossible with a motorhome. It takes a bit to get there because you have to cross the town with narrow streets and slopes, but the effort is worth it."
429825,2932164,1,katy1996,07/07/2023,"We have spent the night there and around 7:30 in the morning the civil guard has arrived, saying that in the entire municipality of Asturias it is forbidden to stay overnight."

429900,3279173,1,Crisglezgolf,10/09/2023,Tonight our wetsuits were stolen. Apparently they are quite selective since they only steal O'Neill and Xcel. Several more vans have been robbed.
429904,3150266,1,relaxontheroad,15/08/2023,"It is not worth paying €5 for something that is not guarded, that you have to ask for the barrier to be closed at 11pm (when the lights go out) and that just 20m away there is a queue of motorhomes, caravans and campers that spend the night without paying There is a lot pending, the water taps do not fit, so friends do not fall and spend the night without paying. When they make a real area with lighting, security, light and so on, then yes"

It has a drinking water point and for emptying black and gray water. It's a pity there is no option to pay for electricity, as the entrance barrier is quite bad and the spaces are quite uneven on the side."

430346,3193822,4,RicharE,21/08/2023,Well set up camper area in an area without many alternatives. The barrier worked well for us at the entrance and exit. The spaces are very narrow for motorhomes. To improve the gray and black water emptying area. For the rest it is very good.
430346,3189551,3,lokaina,20/08/2023,silent at night but the barrier to get in and out is hell. After 20 minutes trying to get out we called the phone number and the second time they answered and they opened the barrier for us
430346,3186732,1,yralla,20/08/2023,"ONE AND NO MORE!! Its realistic. After more than 1 hour, the barrier did not work and they did not pick up the phone, an attempt was made to open a door. To be able to get out what was inside. Well, a tractor from the ones across the street arrived and cut us off. Some rude people who didn't tell us anything. In the end, the local and the GC had to come and they already lowered their tempers. Cannot be emptied, all clogged and a quagmire."

If you have an entry or exit problem, they do not answer the phone, in addition to using rudimentary and aggressive ways to block other ways of exiting you (tractor aggressively blocking another fence without saying a word) If you can, avoid this area."
430346,3183088,1,Monikaimanol,19/08/2023,"HORROR!! We arrive at the area and we agree 3 AC to enter and 1 to exit, so the door is blocked. We call the owner insistently and no one answers. After a while we see another exit and try to help those who needed to get out. THE SURPRISE ARRIVES WHEN A TRACTOR ARRIVES FROM NOWHERE TO BLOCK THE DOOR AND LOCK IT WITHOUT A WORD. THEY VLOCK US AND LEAVE. Not worth it"
430346,3176528,3,LAAUTOVIAJERA,18/08/2023,"Very narrow plots, the unloading area is a quagmire and it is difficult to hit the grid because it is square, the sewage area is. a pvc tube, the road to the town quite dangerous because you have to go by the ditch, there is no shoulder or sidewalk on the road, the area is quiet, good electricity connections with CEE socket, to rinse the pot and the same hose as the filled with water"
430346,3173769,3,PilarHeras,18/08/2023,"It's ok for the night, the drainage leaves a little to be desired, for the gray water there is a drain the size of a sewer grate quite difficult to calculate what makes everyone throw the water out and there is a mudslide , but a good place to spend the night and the children are playing free!"
430346,3158577,3,elfaxana,16/08/2023,"Super large esplanade next to the road and without shade. Of the 12 services that they offer, there are only 4 available, the rest you have to go to the town along a narrow road without a shoulder. The emptying of black and gray water are somewhat rustic but they do their service. Conclusion there are free areas in the area with equal or better services."
430346,3154702,5,Juliarttero,15/08/2023,"We have slept one night in this area because we could not find anything in the area and it has turned out to be one of the best in which we have been. All the perfect services and good location. Close to the town on foot and the beaches of San Antolín, Torimbia and Toranda a bike ride away. We will certainly repeat."
430346,3152200,4,SandrAlfonso,15/08/2023,"Payment area with filling and emptying services and correct to spend one night. For the price it should have toilets and showers at least it has pitches with electricity. Noisy place for other campers who were staying, there were even in tents and caravans within the area. Well leveled and fair plots. There are no shadows. Entry and exit system with license plate reading, web payment"

430346,3139120,3,nice2,13/08/2023,"Pros and cons: Pros: in Llanes there are few places to spend the night without having any problems. For one night and passing through, it's fine. The town has shops and restaurants Cons: too narrow squares. It is not allowed to remove an awning or chairs, although nobody respects it. Very poorly prepared place for emptying gray water, a dangerous road to walk towards the town since it does not have a shoulder."
430346,3129305,1,SSD,12/08/2023,"A lot of noise, both from the traffic on the road right next to it, and from the tractors and dump trucks from the adjoining fields. No shade and very hot. The flies would not leave you alone and there is a section of fence that is not marked as electrified and I was shocked when I accidentally brushed against it."
430346,3128250,2,Kracser,12/08/2023,"The place is appropriate. The pitches are very narrow. The supply/disposal is primitive. The biggest problem is the payment and the exit. QR code doesn't work. Nobody answers the phone. Several WoMos have no luck with the exit. After many attempts in the rain, we held the code up to the entrance. It worked for us, but not for the next one!!"
430346,3120185,5,vanecalvocecilio,11/08/2023,"A highly recommended site both for its geographical location, since there are many options to visit from there, and for the prairie itself. We traveled with a child and it has a lot of space to play quietly with the neighboring children, there are a couple of swings and beautiful views of the Picos de Europa. We have stayed here 4 nights (with that I tell you everything)."
430346,3109336,3,janinam182,09/08/2023,"We stay one night and discovered it by accident. The place is quite ok, but the parking bays are marked out and very small. You can pass the barrier without booking and then pay online."
430346,3107646,3,zjtravel,09/08/2023,We parked here for one night. We didn’t need any of the water facilities so can’t comment but the site was flat and good for one night’s stay. We noticed some people struggle to get in as you need to book online first and show the QR code to the camera/gate to enter. We had no troubles getting in as we had booked. Would recommend for a one night stop over. It’s on the roadside.
430346,3106878,4,mjosesosa,09/08/2023,We stayed one night in this area. It is a very quiet place 20 minutes walk from the beach. away from the town. With all the services for loading and unloading water. We made the reservation online and it was fast and secure.

430346,2991804,5,valdovino,20/07/2023,"Peaceful and quiet place. Pretty close to town if you want to go for a walk. It has electricity and water drainage. I had reserved for 15 euros and when I arrived they refunded part of the money because prices fell. The owner told me that they are going to have barbecues, a children's playground, and more things within the premises. I will be back"

Claim through your email and they only asked us for the account number for the return, I told them that they would enter it through Bizum or through a virtual account and they said they could not."
430346,2960748,2,ClaraBoia,14/07/2023,The booking is online and works 24h/7. It's a big space but it doesn't have toilet nor shower like it says here on the app. It has electricity (you need the  adapters) and WiFi. 15€/ night seems a lot for what is has to offer...
430360,3111420,3,mamarpark,09/08/2023,"Rather quiet corner, some walkers and cyclists in the evening and in the morning but calm to spend a night there. Be careful though, we had a visit from the Policia just before leaving around 10am, just enough time to make them understand that we were leaving and they greeted us and left as well."

About 5 minutes from the beach, far enough from the beach bars to rest at night. The GPS indicates the previous path, you must enter the following one. Call the owner for the key."
430422,2971143,5,venidejerez,16/07/2023,Plot in a very good location. Completely flat and in a super quiet area to rest. Ideal for motorhomes and campers that are totally autonomous since there is no type of service. The owner is very friendly and formal.

On the second visit, we were informed after a short time that the water connection was not there to refuel campers. In the front of the engine compartment for the washer fluid reservoir would be okay. We were then no longer able to fill our bus. Too bad and bad service."

431196,3252805,1,Yliana,03/09/2023,The truth is that it has a resort price and is a mediocre campsite. Another very expensive campsite for what it offers. We leave when we find out the prices. It's a shame because it was an ideal campsite to wait for a family member coming to the airport from Barcelona. Recommended 25%

431197,3249400,4,Vikcente,02/09/2023,"Good place to see Comillas. According to what the guy who runs it told us (very nice), they opened it in July and they still haven't connected the power supply. Since we were in a motorhome, we did not use the shower or toilet. It is next to the road but at night there is not much traffic and you sleep well. We were there on 08/20/2023."

431197,3235195,5,MHONTORIA,29/08/2023,Emptying and filling service. It has a bathroom and a shower. Close to quotes. Quiet site. Very good site.
431197,3229994,1,manucarrasc0,28/08/2023,"They do not notify customers that there is no hot water and charge the same for a half service. When we found out, the boy tells us that there is no electricity and that we have not included it in the rate either, when electricity is only paid if you plug in your van. To have only one bathroom (and small conditions) I don't pay and I go to a free area. The bathroom flooded with water, the shower without a screen... a disaster."
431197,3215840,4,M.G.S,25/08/2023,"Quiet place to rest, the guy who runs it is very friendly. There is a 15 min walk into town. No stores nearby."

431197,3183456,2,Gerardopazos,19/08/2023,"I guess it's unfinished, I don't give it more and it seems to me a shame that they charge you like others already made, a toilet-sink-shower all together in a minimum space, without light, throughout the premises, without any security. the plot is good, the access is good and a walk is easy. When it's finished it will be worth it."
431197,3180860,4,AdanMonzon,19/08/2023,"Good service, the gentleman was very kind. The only downside is that there is only one bathroom and one shower which is cold water. The site is not bad, it has a small grass area but it is for parking vans."
431197,3180551,5,Sofff98,19/08/2023,"Very nice, they made us a place for the van. They have a green area and you can remove the chairs. Despite being close to the road, very quiet night. They have a bathroom and a cold water shower. 12 euros for 24 hours."
431197,3173746,4,CACAHUEfamily,18/08/2023,"Everything very correct. Water change ok. Quiet night. Fair size delimited squares. The only drawback of the grassy and shaded area that we thought was in common use is parking, also somewhat confusing, without a delimited area- for campers. A van came back from the beach and made us remove the table on the grass because “it was where she parks”. All the rest correct."
431197,3160706,5,capitaclorofila,16/08/2023,"Recently built motorhome area. Very nice environment next to a forest, and very friendly hosts. A 20-minute walk from the center of Comillas, ideal for visiting Comillar without having to enter the town with the van."
431197,3152741,4,mlmgm,15/08/2023,"€12/night is for AC that have their places but there is also an area for small campers on grass. Very kind, they are finishing the area since they lack electricity. Cold water in shower and 1 WC. The users are a bit dirty, after showering it floods and there are people who do not clean it. Good area for Comillas and for a sunset in La Corneja."
431197,3150092,4,Davidbtt,15/08/2023,"If traffic noise bothers you, it's not your place, otherwise I would ask for shade and little else. Correct squares, with plenty of room to maneuver, and then you have a good ride up to quotes, better with bikes."
431197,3146307,3,Enrique76,14/08/2023,An area still under construction. At the moment it fulfills the function of being able to pecnotate. I know appreciate initiatives like this. Lots of traffic at night... hard to sleep...
431197,3144201,4,LaPetitaLau,14/08/2023,"Area about 20 'walking from the center of Comillas. Module with a shower and toilet. Emptying and filling water service. Relatively level squares. If the land area is filled, they expand places in the meadow. We spent a quiet night"
431197,3141892,3,Pacomovil,14/08/2023,It is in process. Still far from being a good area. Now it is a car park with a water change at the edge of the road. The worst is the traffic noise even at night. The plots are level and two ACs can change water at the same time. The only toilet and shower are provisional. The shower is cold water.
431197,3141228,4,maysu,14/08/2023,"Very good place, close to Comillas and great people managing it. I am not giving it 5 stars because in the plots that face the road the noise is quite annoying, since the traffic is constant even at night."
431197,3139859,5,speyk,13/08/2023,Very neat site. If you want to just empty and fill it's €4 and the boy is very nice
431197,3139524,5,juanibeard,13/08/2023,"A good motorhome area at 15~20 quotes even without shade. Enough space for about 30 motorhomes, including large ones. Water, gray and black service but not electricity. It seems to me that it is quite good for €12 and more like this area on these dates. In our case we have entered around 7:00 p.m. and we can leave tomorrow at 5:00 p.m."
431197,3138542,3,ingrid87,13/08/2023,If you only want to empty and fill they charge you €4. The gentleman is very kind for that
431197,3117548,5,ManuViP,10/08/2023,"A great place, they still have some details to improve but they seem to be bureaucratic problems etc... close to Comillas to visit, connected to the sidewalk. The staff is very friendly and always willing to help. We will repeat without a doubt. Unfortunately there are few places around here like this..."
431197,3105770,4,marreoyo,09/08/2023,"New site, for now waiting to access some services, for example without electricity (for this reason the shower is cold water for now) and with only one bathroom. The owners very friendly. You can go just take a shower. Next to the road but very quiet. If you want to go to Comillas on foot, the ideal place."
431197,3102268,3,katijoa,08/08/2023,We were really happy when we came to this place but after we came back from the beach (5pm) the place was more than full. Here are 30 camping pitches (which is fine) but the problem is they also allowed to park cars/ caravan at places who are not a regular pitch for a camper. So the whole meadow is full and also a bit of the normal way. Too many people… and than just one toilet and one shower
431197,3101197,5,dundario,08/08/2023,"We don't usually go to camper parks or campsites because of the abusive prices. But this one has a good price and they have also treated us great. It has everything you may need, draining and filling of water included in the price, bathroom with showers and stone floors so that it does not get flooded when it rains. We will repeat if we pass through here and I totally recommend it. It is 20/30 min walk from the center of Comillas."
431197,3100273,5,RakelTenerife,08/08/2023,"The campsite is quite good, quiet, clean and the staff is very attentive. The owner is a charm, very hospitable. It is also very close to the beach and the center of Comillas. Thank you"

There was a lot of traffic from locals I suppose catching fishes and walking dogs, also one van which stayed the night with us. Strong wind was nice but the noice from bridge was kinda loud also dog shelter 50m from spot made a lot of noises too also a lot of trash around …"

431872,3222420,4,JavierBanares,26/08/2023,"The site is spectacular surrounded by nature and overlooking the alsa reservoir. But if you are going to go already rained, it is likely that you will get stuck in the mud. Because that area just becomes a quagmire. That was exactly what happened to me and I had to call the tow truck."
431872,3195157,5,jaranaa,21/08/2023,"tuuuu is a trankilo and boniko deck site. You can see the entire reservoir and below there is a small area to put a hammock or chairs. The guard has come and has not told us anything. Highly recommended, it's beautiful, don't let yourself be kk my people!"

We found it a noisy place with a lot of traffic, and in the morning around 08h-08.30h the police indeed come!! Our extended VW bus was allowed to stay. But if you put your bumper over the road too much, or if your back end sticks too much over the sidewalk, you'll be sent away."
431882,3084825,5,alexamelie17,06/08/2023,We had a quiet night. 30 min from the city center on foot is perfect. free Saturday and Sunday. nothing to say except thank you san Sébastian for this provision of these very practical locations
431882,3041936,4,jumperm,29/07/2023,"Great for visiting the city - either walk 30 min or take the bus. Beach with showers and toilets is closer, approximately 15 min. Stayed there the night with 20 other vans/campers. Wasn’t too loud. Probably better on the weekend since it might be used by students and university staff during the week."
431882,3021071,3,ClaudiaCamper,25/07/2023,"University parking. For a fee from 9:00 to 20:00! ATTENTION the police have come to check you can stay parked but the camper must not go out into the street and the sidewalk must remain free to allow the passage of pedestrians and prams! … park straight ahead occupying a single parking space, not laterally and not in a herringbone pattern!"

The center of San Sebastian can be reached on foot (35min) or by bus (15min). Be careful not to encroach too much on the sidewalk, the police came to see us at 9 a.m. following complaints from neighbors. Park along and not across."

431982,3287708,4,ManuelaVesely,12/09/2023,"Place very well maintained and clean, large pool with a great view. Spaces for RVs are very small, staff is friendly, supply and disposal is possible, but very tight for larger RVs. Overall: highly recommended starting point for exploring the beautiful surroundings"
431982,3285103,4,DMonferrer,11/09/2023,"Good facilities and very well located to visit Cadaqués. Limited plots and virtually non-existent shade. The cleanliness of the showers could be improved. For the price, the last two aspects a bit disappointing."
431982,3276488,3,valou44119,09/09/2023,The value for money is not justified. Dirty toilets. Superficial housekeeping. Not enough traffic. Little shade on the pitches at the top. Noise pollution from the generator 24 hours a day depending on the location. Nice swimming pool. Friendly staff but overwhelmed by events. Confusing between reservations on site and on the internet. The positive point is that it has the merit of existing!
431982,3274790,4,Larsanja,09/09/2023,"The location is great for looking at Cadaqués and the peninsula. Very stylishly renovated. The reception was very nice. Supply and disposal available. Negative: we booked an XL pitch online the day before, but it wasn't available then. Anyone who relies on a large space would have been unlucky. The showers were very dirty, on all days. toilets were ok."
431982,3262860,3,JeremyZzzz,05/09/2023,"Very practical, pleasant and clean campsite with swimming pool. We're usually pretty rootsy but there, we had no choice to visit Cadaques without getting a fine because most of the parking lots nearby are only for the day or very expensive at night (50€!!!!) ) We got away with €37 per night for 2 people with an L2H2 van."
431982,3258269,4,Archelon5,04/09/2023,"Campsite very well located between Cadaques and Port Lligat (5 minutes walk, for the descent, to Casa Dali or the Cadaques seafront). The pitches for motorhomes do not meet the standards expected for the price (2 nights €86 for 2 with electricity and a dog)."
431982,3254423,3,LydieSteph81,03/09/2023,"2 positive points to remember: magnificent view of the sea from our location at the top of the campsite, and the proximity to the town center on foot. Apart from that, the swimming pool is cold, the sanitary facilities are moderately clean, it deserves more visits to clean, it is better to take a shower in the morning than at the end of the afternoon. Nothing that justifies the very high price. ."
431982,3240906,5,borovan,31/08/2023,"Unbeatable location, spacious and tastefully designed bathrooms. Spacious restaurant with a terrace that makes you want to stay. Well-defined and flat plots, without much shade but as it is usually windy in this area it was ideal."
431982,3225650,5,soniaoceano,27/08/2023,"Super tops. The most beautiful campsite we have ever been to. Found a place for the last weekend of August. It really was worth it. The bathrooms feel like a spa. Large pitches. Cool pool and cool restaurant. In addition, for the area, the prices are within the norm compared to unlucky and decadent campsites that ask for the same amount. 47 euros per pitch plus x 2 people + 5 for electricity per day."
431982,3222252,4,Agusti81,26/08/2023,"Camping with clean and spacious facilities, swimming pool with terrace also very good, glamping area and very new and beautiful houses, I give it 4 stars because the camping area is dusty and you don't get the dust off of yourself, I think they would have They improve the part of the camping pitches."
431982,3214118,5,Nadstrip,25/08/2023,"Honestly the best campsite I've been to in terms of standing, cleanliness, equipment… for a fair price. Sanitary area, showers, clean and new toilets, very well maintained campsite, magnificent and clean swimming pool with adjoining bar terrace… near the Dali house (be careful to book in advance to visit), Port Lligat beach with departure for walks by boat and canoe rental, and the city center of Cadaqués which you can visit via a path in 5 minutes (it goes down!! And it goes up on the way back!!?)"
431982,3211461,5,erickgmachin,24/08/2023,This camping is wonderful! Brand new with glamping in mind. If you are in this area is a must to stay.

Highly recommend.

We were in the ""superior"" plot, in the upper part and well, it is further away so the bathrooms and especially the emptying/filling of water and the potty emptying is done very far, it is at the other end. All new and the super nice service, the restaurant is very top. Being in Cadaques, if you go with a 7.5m AC, be patient, EVERYTHING is very narrow."
431982,3085227,4,Taniara,06/08/2023,"Renovated campsite with all the services in the town. We have been here for years and it has nothing to do with it, everything is very careful.

They are absent: showers, Wi-Fi, and other services. There is a beautiful swimming pool, for non-exclusive use and a bar. Area with good potential, to be improved"
432068,3059124,5,red.chevy.van,01/08/2023,"A very nice place that is still under construction. There are very neat toilets and a beautiful, clean, heated saltwater swimming pool. Delicious tapas from the house and a very nice dog. Locals come here to have a drink, so it is pleasantly busy until about eleven o'clock. Very friendly owner who makes you feel 'at home'. No other facilities besides toilets."
432068,3057300,5,Juanito60,01/08/2023,although under construction this area deserves to be known. the family that welcomes you is of a great kindness. the food truck offers you good burgers in the evening under the glitter. the pool is perfect for relaxing. a special thought for the adorable mom
432068,3055945,5,sanchezda79,01/08/2023,"Great place, relaxing. Family welcome by two brothers who run the food truck. The local beer is fresh and excellent. The swimming pool is large. There is a 20 energy space but there were only two of us at the beginning of August. €15 per night. The place is still under construction but the necessary is there. Perfect for a relaxing stopover"
432068,3048790,5,ninours,30/07/2023,"Excellent welcome, very pleasant site and small food truck, swimming pool available at all hours, in short, an excellent moment in peace with very friendly owners. The cheese and charcuterie welcome plates are a delight. An atypical moment for pure relaxation."
432068,3042705,5,midlifemotorhomers,29/07/2023,"Brilliant place!! The first thing that was said to us apart from hi was ' My house is your house' still under construction, toilets super clean. No disposal at all at the moment. Heat pool, fantastic food, great music all day and into the evening. Super sleep, had an amazing impromptu performance by another camper! We had three lots of Jamón e queso given to us through out the day. Great price too"
432068,3037223,5,ferry21,29/07/2023,"services of 10, wc and large pool! food truck and tables to have a drink. Music until 23:00-24:00 on the weekend. Good atmosphere."
432068,3029760,5,ItsasoyJon,27/07/2023,"""You are in your house"" was the first thing they told us and that's how it has been throughout the stay. Very nice atmosphere, great food, great pool... A place to return to without a doubt"
432068,3027935,5,EleneAre,27/07/2023,"We have had a great day in this area! the owners are super nice and attentive, the site is quite large and many vans/motorhomes enter. It has a really cool pool, a chillout area to have a drink, and a food truck to eat (the hamburgers are great). 100% recommended, we would have stayed more days."
432068,3026997,5,Hellen75,27/07/2023,"I arrived and felt like family. A place in the middle of nature, a very good atmosphere, with a pool, music and a food truck with top quality food: a wide variety of craft beer, and Nil prepared a teriñyaki tuna sandwich, delicious!!! Area to spend the night with motorhomes or campers. I'll be back for sure!"
432068,3025675,5,raph49,26/07/2023,"Exceptional places, very promising when it's all over! Very welcoming and very nice family, do not speak French but we manage to understand each other. Family atmosphere, in the evening the locals come to eat and swim, magnificent swimming pool!! Quiet places to rest! Thank you for the hospitality, see you soon"
432068,3009738,5,chispeantes,23/07/2023,"We came for a single day and in the end we stayed for four of how comfortable we were. Super quiet nights, not a noise. Level ground. Music in the bar every day from noon to 11pm or so. The people who run it are lovely, they gave us a hand (without asking!) with a child who got sick and with something else that came up. Very good atmosphere. Mandatory stop."
432068,3002358,5,jnma-family,22/07/2023,"Super motorhome area freshly opened only a month, the family who owns it is a great little food truck attractive price of 2.50€ the drink the burger 6€ perfect and delicious. A great pool to enjoy. Soon there will be the showers finished but there are already toilets. THANKS"
432068,2974855,5,Fanelle27,16/07/2023,Very nice home ! There are plenty of places for motorhomes and the like. The toilets are very clean. The food truck offers drinks at a very reasonable price of 2.50 euros for a very cold and excellent beer! The double dose coke whiskey is 6 euros! The night was calm. The swimming pool is exceptionally large and very pleasant! We recommend this place which deserves a detour!
432068,2973139,4,Quitus,16/07/2023,"It is a very recent area that is under construction. It has the potential to become one of the best in Catalonia. Especially for its spectacular saltwater pool, the food truck with drinks and food and its location in a beautiful and quiet place. When it has filling and emptying services and especially when they play music only until 10 or 11 pm, it will be a must-see place."
432068,2972374,5,EnriciAnna,16/07/2023,"We have spent one night. Currently there is no electricity as it is an area in progress but there is a WC, a shaded area with tables to eat your own food or theirs. Nil is the chef and I can recommend his cochinita pibil and his burritos. Elias is the one who welcomes you, serves the drinks and organizes everything to work. We will repeat. Prices: €15 a night, €2.5 a beer and €7.5 a burrito/cochinita."
432068,2968085,1,MercheRivera,15/07/2023,"The place seemed cool, but I think they didn't want us to stay... €15 per day, and €30, Sisi you read correctly, €30 for electricity. And I have not been wrong because I have asked twice, so for €2 nothing at all... or what I said, he did not want us to stay. So we have not tried the hamburgers on their foodtrack or their salty pool."
432068,2950430,5,lareggae2023,11/07/2023,"Incredible place in the middle of nature, we had a great time dancing and listening to live music, we ate some spectacular hamburgers, we will repeat without hesitation, a mandatory stop for everyone who is en route, the saltwater pool without words."
432068,2950191,5,melazas,11/07/2023,"An incredible day surrounded by good people to chat with and enjoy the music that was on, the food was very tasty, I will not hesitate to stop on my next trip"

432207,3168459,4,ellipse,17/08/2023,Ultra quiet location on the heights of Burgos accessible on foot in 15 minutes. We parked the vehicle for 2 days and 2 nights without any problem.
432211,3271772,5,pgrandea,08/09/2023,"Grass esplanade, with quite a level area, very wide and easy to access. Next to the beach, its bathrooms and showers. We came just to see the crystal beach (which is not that bad), but we liked it and decided to stay the afternoon on the beach and spend the night. Super calm and quiet. We have been 6 or 7 BC"
432211,3096963,5,VicJud,07/08/2023,"Next to the beach, ample parking and many flat places without the need to put chocks. Safe place to be day and night. Close to all essential services."
432211,3095990,5,Oscrod7,07/08/2023,"Next to the beach quite wide. The only drawback I see is that to access you have to go down a street that if the vehicles park on the sides, an AC fits very well."
432211,3016709,5,lauralau86,25/07/2023,"Very central and next to the beach. The only downside is that the seagulls make it difficult to sleep... there were hundreds... It is a wasteland, many vehicles enter, we slept with 6 more motorhomes."
432211,2978788,4,Mariacarpadri,17/07/2023,Good place to spend the night. Very close to the beach and the center of the population.
432227,3129193,5,reneevergauwen,12/08/2023,"Very good beach showers. The floor does indeed look dirty but nothing insurmountable, you can stand there perfectly barefoot and otherwise take your slippers with you."
432227,3080542,1,eva1606,05/08/2023,the shower walls and floor was just awful i wouldn't walk in there even with rubber boots
432227,2974400,5,Bachicha,16/07/2023,"Two free cold showers near the street. Do not use soap or shampoo, the water goes directly into the sand"
432248,3024135,3,TeamKfamily,26/07/2023,We can fill but not drain the black water and for the gray water it is obligatorily in the car cleaning system
432274,3198259,2,hongx,22/08/2023,"We paid 35e for two people one night, the shower and toilet are fine, there is wifi, there is a very basic kitchen and two tables to sit down. The bad thing is the parking, the only flat place is very small, we can't even open the back door (the van measures 4.9m) and very NOISY, being a street in the town, there is a lot of traffic after 6:30 am and it is impossible to sleep, also there is no shade"
432274,3067891,5,Emsen,03/08/2023,We really had a pleasant stay! Thanks very much ! We would have loved to have taken the 2 dogs with us!
432274,3040688,5,cellovandammo,29/07/2023,"Super friendly welcome and with Uber a maximum of 20 minutes from port. However, we could not enter the driveway with our 6m long van and had to park one street further. Model Citroën jumper 6 meters long, 2 meters wide does not hit the driveway unfortunately."
432274,3032443,5,Mani1234,28/07/2023,Ideal for one night to visit Porto. There is space for a maximum of 2 campervans with a maximum length of 6 meters. You will be greeted very nicely by the owner. His dogs need a lot of cuddles. Very very nice. Bus stop about 20 meters away. Bus 603 takes about 25 minutes to Marques. Highly recommended.
432274,3012631,5,pinguinie,24/07/2023,"Very nice reception. There is room for 1 campervan, coming here with a caravan is more difficult. This place is ideal for tents. Showers work fine. 20 meters from the bus stop."
432274,2989910,5,philhofmann,19/07/2023,"This place is absolutely wonderful for those who love camping. It's an ideal destination for outdoor enthusiasts and dog lovers alike. The host, Diogo, is very kind and laid-back. He resides on-site and is always available to answer any questions promptly. I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone in search of a nice experience!"
432314,2959190,5,KingO23,13/07/2023,Spent a quiet night here under a super starry sky. The 15-minute climb to the ruins is also worthwhile.
432320,3146156,1,Dagafarai,14/08/2023,We came to this place that was apparently hidden and the GC passed by in the evening and they took our information and said that if we were there in the morning they would report us.
432320,3109425,5,sophilo,09/08/2023,flat and calm place. next to a stream with a lot of flow. 2 possible locations.
432320,3046550,4,VCruz,30/07/2023,Quiet place on the banks of the river with lots of shade and vegetation. There are low branches in the driveway that can hit the van if it is high
432492,3141274,3,jumiclea,14/08/2023,"Passing through for the night of August 12 where we were 5 motorhomes. This car park is very well located but extremely noisy. At night, hordes of motorbikes, quads and tuned cars pass their engines at full speed on the road 50m away. Despite this, the city is to be seen especially the museum of the thermal baths, the Roman bridge without forgetting to taste the water of the thermal baths at the fountain of the people."
432519,3291382,5,valtiti83,13/09/2023,"Fabulous place surrounded by nature in the area of properties which are also very welcoming. For €15 hot showers, toilets, etc. and waste water discharge."
432519,3284192,5,FernandaSilva,11/09/2023,"Excelent park to stay for the night or spend a few days resting. The parque is located at the entrance of a old estate, close to the main gate and road. You have coffes and groceries shops less than 500 meteres. The park has bathrom and hot shower, outside sink and proper place to empty black and gry water. The owners are very nice and helpful, they show thw estate and give acess to the pool."
432519,3253638,5,mvivo,03/09/2023,"Great place to sleep, shower, get the van ready (empty black and gray water, load water, wash...) and get to know Guimaraes. But it is also a very special place to spend several days, rest and walk. It is in front of the church, easy to get to and has a good entrance. You have to pay, but it's well paid! We will see us again."
432519,3251499,5,BBenTT,02/09/2023,"TOP location with very sympatic hosts who speak english very well. Very clean sanitary. Impressive estate. The landlords are so happy and eager to show you their property. 
Drive to the Church of Tabuadelo on R. de Sao Cipriano. The Camper Park is in front of the Church."
432519,3231420,5,blau0lel,28/08/2023,"Sweetest place, very clean, calm and safe! Shoutout to Juãn, we loved it here! Both speak english very well, invite you to get to know their farm and hike around the huge area."
432519,3225742,5,LOLLET5,27/08/2023,"Very nice spot, with a really nice host! Totally new toilets and showers (unfortunately it doesn't get very warm but it's ok) we'd love to come back! I think that's a great insider tip!"
432519,3180762,5,MG1030,19/08/2023,"Perfect place to spend the night. The owners are charming, they let you take a walk around the farm and see the wonderful Pazo they have. Also, showers, toilets very clean. It has a service area and to wash the dishes. Totally recommended."
432519,3169069,5,Anna196,17/08/2023,A great pitch with super loving hosts + family! We stayed two nights and we felt very safe! There are two showers and toilets and a sink here! There is also a sink here to wash your dishes. Top up fresh water/empty black and gray water without any problems! Thanks for the great opportunity and the great time!!!
432519,3152329,5,Maria.SS,15/08/2023,"Very nice park, with the support of bathrooms, showers and dishwasher. The owners (very friendly) gave us the possibility to take a walk around the Quinta. A fabulous place to visit."
432519,3100765,5,b.ribeiro2035,08/08/2023,"Private park, in the final stages of construction, very pleasant and with very friendly and helpful owners. Great for those who like to relax, surrounded by the silence of nature. Good for walks and as a starting point for visiting the beautiful and charming city of Guimarães. Public transport in front of the park."
432519,3012042,5,Mlune,24/07/2023,"Quiet place and very nice and available owner. Still under construction, you have to be autonomous but ok to do all the services. Possibility of walking in the property. Strongly recommended."
432519,2967930,5,PimsMotorhome,15/07/2023,"Superb place. Super friendly owners. Single farm. Despite not being completely ready, it's already one of the best wings I've ever been. I recommend."
432519,2966663,5,MariaGuilherme,15/07/2023,"Very peaceful night. Excellent for walking in nature. Very friendly owner. All new. Still in finishing. We went to the cafe on foot, very close."
432704,3202642,3,jcanalitos,23/08/2023,"End of the street, where there is a private urbanization. Peaceful. 400m from the beach. Something uneven. Personally there are better places."
432790,2973600,1,polskidunczyk,16/07/2023,Very tight entrance. Almost impossible for a camper to get through. Seems like someone blocked the drive in intentionally
432817,3282469,4,fraulife,10/09/2023,Huge parking lot with mountain views. Great place to spend the night and go swimming during the day. plenty of shops and delicious restaurants nearby. Felt safe.
432817,3274690,3,nigmulane,08/09/2023,"Large car park, free and very close to the sea. No services and a little dirty but fine to park and enjoy the beach for a day."
432817,3136196,1,Franciscolin,13/08/2023,"The good thing about it is that the beach is spectacular and quiet we are in the middle of August and there are four people just the ground or the sand of the stone beach and it is special and great for it to hit you, like other sandy beaches it is like 600 meters as the ad says the car park."
432817,3136182,1,Franciscolin,13/08/2023,"The parking lot is not special for motorhomes or to sleep, you have to be aware and next to it there is a hotel there are caravans of street vendors and it gives a little bit of distrust for free."
432840,2957917,5,juanjoyachtskipper,13/07/2023,"It came in handy for me to find this place, we visited the town, ate in its bars and spent a fairly quiet night."

432851,3056215,1,sheisma,01/08/2023,Not recommended the guards pass soon

432889,3233066,1,SergioGomes,29/08/2023,"Unfortunately, now on 28/08/23, there is a sign prohibiting motorhome parking. I couldn't find any place to park that didn't have a sign prohibiting motorhomes, so I ended up staying at the municipal camping site."
432889,3023760,5,celigwenlec,26/07/2023,very quiet nickel. close to Mira 15min walk.
432889,2969752,3,cannu7445,15/07/2023,"Good park, quiet and clean. It has no services."
432914,3284654,5,Ciaokes.byekes,11/09/2023,"We spent 2 nights there in a van. Superb place with sea view. Surrounded by nature, quiet. Sufficiently flat terrain. Respect places like this, don’t leave anything lying around."
432914,3282960,5,bleleve,10/09/2023,"A sublime spot with a breathtaking view when you wake up, and really very easy to access. We slept there for one night in a rooftop tent. If the location is taken, you can continue to climb to the right, there are several along the path, some of which have a view of the sea."
432914,3265209,5,steffme,06/09/2023,"Quiet, great views and pure nature!"
432914,3186168,5,Brotdose,20/08/2023,"Beautiful spot! If taken, there is another beautiful one a further down the route. Both were occupied so we took another one further up. That one was also good and flat enough but without view."
432914,3185080,5,Jade66,20/08/2023,"I loved this spot, far from everything. To get there it is very passable, beautiful climbs in sight but not disturbing! The silence was very pleasant! I recommend !"
432914,3134258,5,benji11,13/08/2023,Great spot. Truly alone in the world. We saw no one except mountain bikes at 8:30 am who said hello to us. We are in a roof tent. Access by car this fact but on a dirt road a little bumpy but without problem. Incredible sea and forest views!!!!!
432978,3058837,5,ivanalazar,01/08/2023,I stopped to spend the night from Valencia to Galicia. Perfect for lounging and sleeping. Respect the environment.
433127,3290357,5,iza123iza,12/09/2023,"A great place to sleep peacefully and with a spectacular night sky, remember to leave it clean because there were many towels on the floor"
433191,3245294,4,bigpen2023,01/09/2023,"We didn’t want to park in the center as everyone says you’ll be broken into. Fair enough. This place is great, 5 min walk to the train, it takes 15-20 mins to get into town (via train). Very easy. You can hear the trains at night but that’s fine for us. For a safe place to sleep and visit Barcelona, this place is great. There are large bins too. NOTE: we parked in the middle as it’s flat. The two sides are slanted, so we were lucky the middle was free."
433191,3114960,5,FabiodiGarnele,10/08/2023,For Barcelona a really good place. Safe and well connected to the city as well as the roads. You need 3 min to the station that gets you in 15 min to Barcelona. Especially if passing by Barcelona a great spot. No signs of camping prohibited. Some wild boars and other animals at night visible but no danger.
433203,3215243,5,MarionCas,25/08/2023,"Very natural place. Beautiful panorama. We spent the night surrounded by horses who came to scratch on the truck;) Waking up to the top in this natural setting. Barcena Mayor is not far and the villages in the area offer groceries, fountains..."
433203,3179042,5,tetelle33190,19/08/2023,Extraordinary spot with a magnificent sunset. The place is super quiet in the middle of nature and very easy to access. Very rare in the sector where it was difficult to find nice and unoccupied spots at that time.
433203,3156109,5,Windkracht51,15/08/2023,"There is nothing here, except for a fantastic view and complete tranquility. A top spot for us. A number of fellow campers present did not detract from this. Easily accessible."
433203,3124560,5,CrisVitota,11/08/2023,magical site. With room for several vans and AC quite level. The stars from here something incredible! Carmona is beautiful too!
433203,3097283,5,Luasintes,07/08/2023,"The view is totally amazing. Access without any problem. Nothing crowded, we went late in the afternoon and there were only 2 other ACs. We stopped just for the views, but it seemed like the others were staying the night. Partly irregular terrain. I highly recommend seeing the town of Carmona before/after, also with a great area to park the camper."
433203,3061938,5,RitaMiranda,02/08/2023,Amazing spot! We arrived when it was all covered by fog but in the morning it was all cleared and the views were superbe!!
433203,3005726,5,bkabri,23/07/2023,"Gorgeous !!!! Thank you for sharing this kind of nugget with us. Please leave the place clean, it's really sad to see papers everywhere :("
433277,3278057,5,StefanT500,09/09/2023,"My all-around experience was an absolute pleasure.. lovely n rustic & tranquil, perfect.. greeted with freshly picked grapes & figs. I made great friends for the future, and I will definitely be back.. just half an hour away from El Rocio (Unchanged Spanish Ranch Town).."
433277,3274669,5,ChristelGril,08/09/2023,a great welcome and a good night's sleep in Serge and Jacques' tent! we will come back.
433277,3180728,4,floelsa11,19/08/2023,"Easy access, clean grounds, we stayed here for one night on our way to Portugal, it was perfect! The most positive point is the welcome and the service! Even in the event of a hassle or problem, you can count on the owner! 12€ one night in a van for 4 people! Great with shower, ELEC and small above ground pool! One star less for near road noise. Overall perfect!"
433277,3134880,5,ORoeckle,13/08/2023,"I recommend this place because of the tranquility of the place and the absolutely friendly owner. The whole thing is still under construction, the men still have a lot planned. But everything is available shower, kitchen, grill and refrigerator. We had great conversations with the owner and his friend. My children got absolutely fresh figs from own tree. THANK YOU AND GOOD LUCK FOR THE FUTURE"
433277,3107357,5,kak43,09/08/2023,"A great stay for the whole family. a very warm welcome from Jacques and Serge! Very good advice for visits. Great amenities facilities. We were able to take advantage of the swimming pool, the shower, the shelter to eat… in short, the dog was happy to be free… we will come back if we can! We recommend 100%! Thanks for the stay!"
433277,3069015,3,Allard-Familly,03/08/2023,A very good welcome by Jacques. The children were able to play and enjoy the swimming pool. Small downside the nearby and very busy road.
433277,3039118,5,AlexJeunet,29/07/2023,"We couldn't have hoped for better! Very well received by Serge and Jack, who were lovely with us during our stay. They welcome caravans as tents, and provide showers, toilets, kitchen, living room, swimming pool, everything you need. And all that for a pittance. The place is very easy to get to, quite close to the road."
433313,3249839,3,JAALKA,02/09/2023,Agree with previous comment: perfect for a lunch stop/overnight stop. Views of the river amidst a small ‘forest’ of pine trees. A relaxing lunch stop whilst it rained. Didn’t stay over night but seemed quiet enough. We probably would’ve stayed overnight to break a long journey.
433320,3214116,1,olivierguilly,25/08/2023,We didn't stay. Detritus. Lots of flies and it's impossible to stay calm outside the vehicle.
433320,3198625,5,llanicos,22/08/2023,"We slept very peacefully, a little inclined, but we didn't even put the bedpans on. little traffic around. Yes, there is uncollected garbage and some annoying flies."

Only that you can't get into the water at the front of the bus because there are rocks isn't that great. Otherwise great place.

The only positive thing we could say is that it is the closest car park to the center of Nazaré. It is in the middle of a road with traffic and unpaved, as well as having no services. Large motorhomes may have problems. I recommend the car park near Lidl and Continente"

434832,3060398,3,Imanolx,02/08/2023,New filling and emptying service area. The showers are in the restaurant building (€3 per person to pay). I think it is worth going to a campsite. 1 motorhome €7 light €4 shower €3 person. At night you sleep well considering the passing of trucks since it is next to a gas station but early in the day it is very unpleasant since the traffic is beastly.
434832,3005453,5,juani40,23/07/2023,"New area with electricity and water... we only spent one night because we were passing through but yes. Doubt to repeat, Right next to restaurant, gas station, with showers, bathrooms and store."

The black water dump (cassette) is filthy. Please, it doesn't cost anything to clean up what we've messed up. Then it's no wonder that we are frowned upon, and as always, they pay for each other. Thanks autarchy"

435837,3011496,5,EmmaGama,24/07/2023,"We have slept one night in the middle of July and super well. Parking almost empty, there were only 4 motorhomes. silent place. Near this site there is another car park, in front of the stadium, but without a doubt we found this much better. 0 problems with police"
435837,2988338,3,anaman,19/07/2023,"It is a very large car park next to the Palacio de los Deportes. There are no services, just garbage. Park well between the two stripes so you don't get fined. It is NOT possible to park from 00:00 to 18:00 every Sunday because the Gijón “rastro” appears."
435854,3055785,3,enricu,01/08/2023,"Good place to rest for a while, go to the beach or release the dog on the grass (they can't go on that beach)."

436102,3099252,1,manuarpz,08/08/2023,"The location to see Tavira is perfect, but the place is not safe to leave the motorhome because suspicious-looking guards pass by asking for money to ""take care"" of your vehicle. We paid €4 to the first one that happened as soon as we parked but at 1am another one came by asking again accompanied by people with ski masks from a car. Horrible experience we will not return to this location."
436102,2991098,5,Serbumm,20/07/2023,Safe place to leave the van parked. Near a park and in a garden area. We have spent the night quietly. That if ... at the point of the morning you hear traffic and the train that passes above.
436113,3047973,1,MiriVan8,30/07/2023,"We left because parking was prohibited due to clearing, it is also small and it seems that it is filled with people who live on that street... it is not a plan to take up so much space for them being a small place. We went to the seafront. Another good option was where the municipal swimming pool was."
436113,3035296,5,herve34,28/07/2023,"This small dirt car park, slightly sloping, is ideal for visiting this beautiful city, a 5-minute walk from the historic center. Very calm night. Supermarket 100m away for shopping. No service."

 Near the main road,so expect some trafic noise. 
There was a few motorhomes and vans spending the night aswell. 
Not perfect, but good enough."

436183,3142952,5,febecl,14/08/2023,Reception of two loving people who are very concerned about the well-being. It's a great place for natural swimming and unwinding. We didn't get across the bridge in our Sprinter and slept under the open sky on our mattresses or the children in the tent. You should be able to cross the bridge with a VW bus. The sunset spot is mega! We'd love to come back!
436183,3090168,3,romainSophie,06/08/2023,Please note that access is only accessible for small vans (because we have a streamlined motorhome and we could not cross the bridge because it is rounded)

436410,3202674,5,Swennib,23/08/2023,"Nice place. We felt very comfortable and safe. Overnight stays are allowed, but no camping. Police patrol. The beach is fantastic, even surfing was possible. For 1 € the best we have experienced on our trip so far. The baker comes in the morning or around 11am."
436410,3202121,5,RitxiAzzena,22/08/2023,"A paradise. You pay €1 and park super easy and level. Dogs can be loose and even if they can't access the beach there is a river 50 meters from the beach where they can bathe without any problem. The beach bar has good prices. To repeat. Of course, in the morning the municipal police pass by, as is fair, and if you have tables or anything outside the van they attract your attention."
436410,3196768,5,miguelichi7,21/08/2023,A jewel of Asturias 200 meters from the beach. 1 euro 24 hours. They do not fine for spending the night but there are many who abuse taking everything and even tents. Let's take care of this place!

436410,3163238,5,jenlin5,16/08/2023,"Fantastic place! Huge parking lot on the meadow. The cool river and the beach are lovely. The bars and the range of showers and toilets are top notch.

436410,3151762,4,McLisbeth,15/08/2023,"Large esplanade to spend the night, very quiet. No services. There are toilets and showers on the beach. €1 is paid voluntarily. Shame on the users who take out awnings, tables, chairs... It's not camping. Let's respect the rules because in the end they will prohibit parking for those of us who travel on wheels"
436410,3151716,3,moraida,15/08/2023,It is a good place but a little too crowded. Comfortable to be with children with a beach 1 min away.
436410,3151183,5,SergioRP,15/08/2023,"Spectacular to visit with the dog, and make the route to Oviñana/Cavo Vidio while it clears up a bit (quite a lot of people). Around 7 only vans/AC remain and it is much quieter. It hurts the 4 who take out the p... sofa to be at home, as well as those who throw their butts on the ground. But a place to repeat without a doubt. €1 volunteer for ""association that maintains the place"" (they say)."
436410,3150180,1,rabel555,15/08/2023,"Hyper crowded site, without control. You can NOT CAMP, remove tables, chairs and awnings, ONLY STAY OVERNIGHT 48h. GC passes by taking registrations. The environment is not respected, people with total ignorance of Nature dam the river with stones and sticks altering the natural order of the river with the consequent DANGER of FLOODING that made them have to remove the campsite from here for this reason"
436410,3150052,1,rasoldot65,15/08/2023,"Great place but crowded. People DO NOT respect the natural environment, they alter the RIVER by plugging it with stones and sticks causing flooding and diseases such as SALMONELOSIS in stagnant water. You cannot camp, take out awnings or tables and chairs, you only stay overnight for 24/48 hours. The civil guard passes by taking photos of the license plates. Please RESPECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE RULES."

I have seen some comments about why they charge €1, but we arrived at 7:00 p.m. and we did not live with anyone to take care of it. I imagine that they may charge to access the bathroom and shower area on the beach."
436410,3064341,5,BrackeHedwig,02/08/2023,At least there is enough space. Restaurant of the camping in front decent prices and good hamburger eaten with all options. Good place to relax for a while.

In some comments it is written that it is forbidden to take out the awning, chairs and table. We stayed there for two nights, settled in and no one told us. The little extra is the baker who comes by in the morning (we were at 11am). I recommend !"

From there you can visit the lighthouses (approx 30 min) and do two bars, although we couldn't go because they were full. Go early to get a good seat. The only problem, some neighbors from ac who decided to have a party until 3 in the morning."
438265,3143346,1,lunguita,14/08/2023,"The site is spectacular, with views that are a privilege, but in the morning the police came and told us that we couldn't stay overnight because it was a protected area. There is no coverage. It gets very crowded. We went with a large car and a trailer and we were able to park, although it became much more crowded later."
438265,3141232,5,enriquezf,14/08/2023,"Beautiful sunset. A lot of people go to see it and the parking lot gets too crowded, difficult for large motorhomes. Route of about 4 km to see the lighthouses on foot."
438265,3110345,4,verbu,09/08/2023,"Good place to spend the night. The area is very crowded and there are those who lengthen the sunset more than necessary. We caught a couple of groups making a bottle, but they left relatively soon. The place is good and the parking too."
438265,3048281,5,JuanNadie,30/07/2023,"Accessible site, quite crowded but it is easy to find where to park. Everyone stays to watch the sunset."
438267,3156818,1,pericofrontera,16/08/2023,Parking must be reserved in advance! The Rural Guard passes every morning and sanctions overnight stays and camping!
438267,3069661,2,baristi,03/08/2023,"The car park has a parking fee of about 5,5€ per day during the summer and needs booking in advance. The “guardia rural” comes early in the morning as sleeping is forbidden and checks everyone there, be aware sleeping is forbidden throught the whole national park."

438334,3144710,5,Mahryalex,14/08/2023,"excellent spot, accessible to all vehicles. quiet, little traffic, shaded. just the Google gps does not take you to the point given on the map...do not take the path that leads to the showers, continue the road, take the second path on the left, follow the wheel tracks on the ground!"
438372,3099220,2,Oscrod7,08/08/2023,"Perfect for parking near the center (12 minutes from Maria Pita square) but to access it you have to go down a dead end street with potholes and a lot of unevenness. We have spent the night but there is too much unevenness to be able to sleep well, besides the area is a field without light where cars park and does not inspire confidence."
438415,3236501,4,mgxmgxlp,30/08/2023,Quiet location for sleeping. We stayed one night. We were alone
438480,3223881,5,EliRam,27/08/2023,"Great place to rest and disconnect. Very clean bathrooms, with everything you need available, even a refrigerator!! Spectacular pool with hours until 11 at night. The charming owners, from the first minute they seem like friends. For €25 it is well worth stopping in this area, which is also cooler since there is a lot of green. When we return to the south this will be our place! Thank you!"
438480,3211104,5,fabian2003,24/08/2023,Super nice owner. Property is well maintained and the pool is incredibly beautiful. Toilet and shower also ideal. I'd love to come back

438480,3159740,5,jmleongracia,16/08/2023,"A wonderful place, the charming owners, the wonderful complex, the beautiful surroundings, the spectacular pool, and we were lucky enough to meet some good motorhomes, in short everything is perfect, except that you are so comfortable, that the beers are perfect for you. You drink like water. Good luck to the family, they are earning it."
438480,3141133,5,SLL,13/08/2023,"Spectacular site, surrounded by nature, 5 minutes from Salto del Usero and other impressive places for swimming. Super quiet area, well-kept and with a magnificent pool. And for the owners I lack stars to rate them, kindness, helpful... we will repeat for sure 100%. Thanks for everything and have a wonderful time. A hug"
438480,3080763,5,maruxhi,05/08/2023,"We saw the door closed but we called the phone and they opened for us in seconds. We were going to spend one night because we were en route but in the end we spent 2 because the surroundings and the huge pool are spectacular. Thank you very much for everything, we will be back!!!"
438480,3075380,1,Indra73,04/08/2023,Reception closed and mostly empty in the middle of the afternoon. Impossible to see anyone apart from a gentleman who was cleaning the swimming pool... this one simply answered no to our question of the possibility of sleeping one night...
438480,3048234,5,terribullas,30/07/2023,"A magnificent place to disconnect in nature. As it says, 5 minutes from the Salto Usero area. And very friendly and charming owners."
438494,3015560,5,BartNomade,24/07/2023,"We parked there for 3 days in June when we took a plane trip. We arrived the night before the flight, we slept without problems. On the way back, our flight arrived at dawn, so again we slept a few hours in the motorhome before leaving the parking lot."
438601,3284174,1,Julie169,11/09/2023,Entrance to sewage farm. We left and went to a campsite
438601,3274320,3,stephanooo,08/09/2023,"For us it would have been plan C. The square in the city was full and this one was completely empty - but it smelled of drains at short intervals, which is why we drove further out of town to the other square."
438601,3204313,3,EstebanEtxebarria,23/08/2023,it is a plan b to see lekeitio when the area is full. we spent night 6 ac and without problem.
438601,3202257,4,Benatgar,22/08/2023,"There was no room in the area, so we spent the night here. There is a more or less level place for about 4 ACs. The town center is about 15 minutes away. There is a treatment plant next door, but there was a lot of smell. the pumps going at night did not disturb our sleep"
438601,3134640,3,floflo2112,13/08/2023,"Convenient for parking during the day when the official pk is full. We went further down the path. We parked on the grass. If there hadn't been the noise from the sewage treatment plant, we would have slept there because of the little country air. We preferred to sleep on the one near the road"
438601,3042079,4,jumperm,29/07/2023,Does its job when the caravan parking lot is full and you wanna visit the town. Walk takes around 20 min. Next to a sewing plant.
438652,3288650,5,sebbruno,12/09/2023,"Very large, flat and stabilized parking lot, very few cars, we spent a very quiet night with around ten camper vans, close to the city center."

438652,3282164,4,LidiaPA,10/09/2023,"Super large parking lot, parking without problem. We have spent Saturday night and although there is a disco there, nothing has bothered us. I have felt safe. We have parked towards the back. Everything super close. I don't give it a 5 because there are no services."
438652,3267547,5,clinetous1,07/09/2023,"flat parking, quiet night, no noise, a few camper vans not far from the sea"

438652,3243498,3,slavkinvan,31/08/2023,"Few minutes walk from the beach, not very clean. Okay for one night."
438652,3242490,3,krysreine,31/08/2023,"One of the only - and least worst - possibilities for parking in this city. Large beaches, still very popular at the end of summer. French Riviera, lots of traffic, craftsmanship made in china. Lots of party people at night with music in the background. Be careful not to pass through the city: very narrow streets!"
438652,3231588,3,llavilla,28/08/2023,"large and fairly level gravel esplanade. without services of any kind, at night there is a disco there and until 4 in the morning a lot of noise and racket. Central to know Nazare. city that should have in this same place a space for loading and unloading water for motorhomes, it is not conceivable that Nazare has nothing with the type of tourism that it mainly has."
438652,3224150,2,sarabara,27/08/2023,"We went early to park so we could take advantage of the beach and then spend the night here, but even at 9:30 in the morning it was already full. We had to go and find our lives through Nazaré to park, which is very difficult at this time. We parked at the end of the promenade where we put to go to the beach and we left. An AC area is needed, otherwise it is very complicated."
438652,3213555,3,CarolineJimmy,25/08/2023,"large car park easy to park there (we have a CC of 7m40). 5 minutes walk from the beach and all the shops. no services on this car park. the downside a lot of waste and open-air public toilets, at the start of the car park there is a disco open from Wednesday to Sunday inclusive, so very noisy loud music and many people in the car park, it's a shame."
438652,3213422,4,berubio,24/08/2023,"Very large free parking in the center of the village. Spectacular viewpoints almost next door, the beach about 10 minutes away and the promenade with all the bars and restaurants about 15 minutes away on foot. Be careful, then you have to go up! You can also take the elevator up for €4 pp. There is more AC so you feel accompanied to sleep."
438652,3206196,4,Chulete,23/08/2023,"The truth is that you cannot give a bad score because it is what it is, an esplanade near the beach and with a bar next to it. No services. There is plenty of space but no shade."
438652,3198968,4,Jenny3329,22/08/2023,"We got there around 3pm to get to the beach lots of spaces, easy to park. Several CC installed for the night. Center and beach accessible in a few minutes on foot. Very convenient !"
438652,3183234,4,samu669,19/08/2023,Very good for parking. town and near the beach. Simple overnight stays also possible. Very busy during the day.
438652,3183158,4,celineetkiki,19/08/2023,"close to everything, from the beach market to restaurants and shops, the floor is really very white and the smells are sickening when you leave the car park, you have to get there in the evening or early in the morning to have space without maneuver too much"
438652,3182761,4,jausoul,19/08/2023,Perfect place! Plenty of space and close to everything you need. If I had shade I would have everything. That if there are no services. Bon voyage :) J.
438652,3172645,4,MiriamCamp,18/08/2023,"Very good place, both in proximity to the beach and to the center of Nazaré. Access is good and in the summer season there is plenty of space as long as you come first thing in the morning or after 8:30 in the afternoon. The only ""bad"" thing is that there is a nightclub nearby but we parked far from it and I barely heard it, for the most sensitive with earplugs you can't hear anything."
438652,3171003,2,tempetefam,18/08/2023,"Correct parking for parking during the day, we spent the night there, city center parking mixing population and nocturnal noise (vibration of a nightclub at 5am) For troubleshooting only!"
438652,3160387,2,happycamper18,16/08/2023,Large place with many campers and cars - parking / driving wildly. Very dusty and no shade. We drove on
438652,3158736,4,joanes,16/08/2023,"Good place to spend the day and night. close to the beach and the center. Many ACs. It is better to come at the last or first minute, due to the number of cars there are."
438652,3156617,3,AndreLAURAS,16/08/2023,"Very large flat car park covered with gravel. Ideal for visiting the city on foot and very close to the beach. Many people nevertheless during the day, the best is to arrive at the beginning or end of the day. Quiet for the night but background music."
438652,3145829,3,anojosa,14/08/2023,"Very big and dusty. Sunday very difficult to park, better to arrive early. The best thing is the situation to visit the promenade and town. We slept peacefully one night."
438652,3140603,4,Muri150,13/08/2023,Very large parking lot. During the day very crowded and with a lot of traffic but very good to sleep. Quiet at night and close to the town and the beach.
438652,3138319,5,NataliaPR9,13/08/2023,"Large, free and secure parking. We slept one night accompanied by many AC and camper. The beach is a 5-minute walk away. A very nice promenade with free WC."
438652,3127961,3,Aroudj44240,12/08/2023,We spent one night there. Very large car park near the beach and the center. Too bad it is in the ground because very dusty and noise from the disco late at night (get well at the bottom side of the reeds to limit the noise)
438652,3119748,4,Stefanoa,11/08/2023,"Ample free parking, near the beach and 10 minutes from the center of the lower city. We slept in the company of 20 other campers that's for sure. If you want to spend the night, park away from the disco which stays open until late at night at a low volume."
438652,3118558,4,MTM25,10/08/2023,"Parking ok, very close to the beach. Big space. On the other hand, provide earplugs for the night, the bar at the entrance plays really loud music!"
438652,3114504,3,BlackSunlight,10/08/2023,Self-service parking. AC and many vans (many cars during the day) very close to the beach and town. Good for one night.
438652,3109082,5,GordonAntony,09/08/2023,"Nice big place, without electricity and disposal or supply. it costs. No problem with a self-sufficient mobile home or like us for only three days. Three minutes to town or the beach."
438652,3106375,4,VernetRomain,09/08/2023,"quiet, perfect for a night with many other motorhomes. No service. 200m from the beach. Free! even on August 8..."
438652,3104781,4,luiser,09/08/2023,The location of the park is very good. The beach and the village atmosphere are close by. There is a great atmosphere in the town.
438652,3103089,3,junss,08/08/2023,large gravel parking lot. 5min from the beach. quiet at night. Not the dream spot but does the trick for a night and to spend the day in Nazaré
438652,3080013,4,familleFLJ,05/08/2023,"Huge car park 2 steps from the center and perfectly flat surrounded by vegetation. We stayed 2 days and nights with 3 children and with 38 other motorhomes (can hold a hundred) relatively quiet, the disco opens at midnight, the music is not so disturbing for a parking lot in town and does not not hear all night, I recommend really easy to get to!"
438652,3077480,3,tuckertransit22,04/08/2023,"We stayed here on the grand opening of “N bar”. Thought it was a coffee shop but turned out to be the ibiza of Nazare. Music on until 5am and was very loud- awful for a nights sleep. However, great and easy parking for a couple of days and nights."
438652,3074218,4,Cacharrosaurio,04/08/2023,"We have spent a night with quite a few motorhomes and the space is spacious and close to the beach and the town. we parked with no problem. The only thing, what they say about the noise from the music from the disco and of course, the people who are talking. When leaving we have seen a sign that opened on 02/08. If you get to the bottom of the parking lot you should hear a lot less."
438652,3072383,4,normanlmb,04/08/2023,"Large site and very close to the promenade, no service in the parking lot. If there are activities in NBar you will have music until dawn"

438652,3067487,2,moumoul,03/08/2023,"a comment that was not mentioned, but parking next to a nightclub with music until 4/5am. I don't know the other days, it's up to you. but for us bad night."
438652,3062555,5,ikaner,02/08/2023,"Very good free parking to spend the night and visit Nazare, the beach and all kinds of cafes, shops one step away. There is quite a bit of dust but a lesser evil. Quite a few motorhomes and I feel safe."

438899,3259368,5,ToniVan93,04/09/2023,Busy but huge car park right behind Praia do Falesia. Perfect for sleeping and camping. During the day the beach bar sells tokens to use the beach showers. In the morning when you leave the caretaker asks for €5. Highly recommended
438899,3253529,4,touphi,03/09/2023,"quite far from the restaurant, certainly at 5€ but with a huge area reserved for bedrooms with shade and where you can spend the night. dirt road but very doable no service"

438899,3180624,5,xripbon,19/08/2023,Super large parking. We were able to stay overnight although it has a price of €5. In the afternoon we entered without paying and in the morning they went around pointing at the cars and asking for the money. We were accompanied by more AC and everything was great.
438899,3178596,5,Carriehome,19/08/2023,"Parking on land after a dusty dirt road. Very close to the beautiful beach where there is a bar-restaurant. No service. Cold showers on the beach for a fee of 1 euro. Quiet night, there was some music from a club in the distance, but it's not annoying. A gentleman passes in the morning around 9:30 and collects the 5 euro parking fee."
438899,3173992,4,GallegoGoAl4,18/08/2023,Perfect to stay a couple of days. 10 meters from the beach. Pretty much level. Quiet. The owner of the car park is very friendly. €5 a day and allows you to stay overnight. There is a bar and showers for €1/min. advisable
438899,3154287,4,Gonzalosd,15/08/2023,"Quite a comfortable place to spend a weekend at the beach since it is a few meters away. It has a nearby bar, although it is removed from supermarket areas. It does not have any type of service (electricity, water, disposal). The price is €5. To spend a weekend that you want to enjoy the beach I recommend it."
438899,3111488,4,uliha,09/08/2023,"Great place to spend a few nice days at the beach! Two downsides: no supply/disposal and in the high season at night sometimes very obtrusive sound from the club hotel, which was about 400m away."
438899,3104520,5,JamillaAicha3,08/08/2023,"great place!
we arrived here at 18.30 and the place was packed with cars. we could just drive through and couldn't find where we needed to pay?? 
all the campers were near the trees. we parked next to a tree/bush and went out for dinner. after we came back at 22.00 the whole place was EMPTY! (except for the vans near the trees) so we parked in-between trees on the other side of the terrain."

438979,3255373,4,TrikiUnai,03/09/2023,"After trying different places in Zarautz, I ended up choosing this one. I called the local police (udaltzainak) and they told me that it is okay to sleep. You can't take out tables and such but you can sleep without a problem. During the day there is a parking lot next door with bathrooms and tables, which is great. Sleeping plugs and solved"
438979,3100804,3,EduGarSe,08/08/2023,"Perfect for parking, in the town in summer it is IMPOSSIBLE with a large camper. There is a train that for a small fee takes you to the beach. Disadvantage: you cannot stay overnight. They inform us that the police pass by at night and take photos to punish you."

Quiet place Do not follow the route of this navigator, there are signs in the village. It's a shame that the same mistake has been made in other areas of the Penedès of putting the water block behind the emptying platform, which sometimes complicates and delays the work. But go ahead, this is better than nothing."

439481,3209663,4,Socarraet,24/08/2023,It is an area without electricity outlets but it has a terminal for filling and emptying water. Many of the plots have some incline. It is better to follow the indications of Google Maps because there is a road sign put up by the town hall that is completely and absolutely wrong just 200 meters away and makes you take some terrible turns.
439481,3200091,5,migueldoaz,22/08/2023,"Actually it is not an area for motorhomes, but a public parking lot next to a school but they have located the necessary services for motorhomes, refueling water and emptying gray and black ones there. The parking lot is spacious because it is designed as a battery, although the motorhomes do so in a cordon due to their dimensions. Some squares quite uneven."

Camper service complete service for loading, unloading toilets and gray water. Place reserved for the disabled. Regularly emptied garbage cans present. The area is adjacent to a green area where you can bring your animal friends. The only flaw is that it is about 2 km from the center"

We were able to rest at night despite being full. They planted a lot of trees, that's why it would be a 4.5 because it lacks shade. Thanks to the City Council and let's take care of the area, I saw motorhome behavior, especially in the service area, which was unhygienic. Let's leave it clean!"

A pity that travelers do not respect the hours of rest."

440225,3215373,5,MerceCB,25/08/2023,"Perfect parking to sleep and park next to the beautiful Isla beach. It is a grassy field that is next to the road but if you go inside you do not hear anything. In the evening, many vehicles come, both motorhomes and campers, but you sleep very peacefully. Thanks to the town hall of this town for this car park that despite not having services we have loved"

440225,3114210,4,audreych53,10/08/2023,very good location very quiet night no possibility to take out the tables but we did not see the police. No service but a huge parking lot very well unmarked for cars and motorhomes. we arrived at 8 p.m. there was plenty of room because the beach attendants were leaving. The beach 10 minutes walk
440225,3079303,4,buri2,05/08/2023,"Very quiet place (from the background you can't hear the road) large and spacious. 4 stars because you can't even remove a chair. The police come by every day, they don't fine you if you're not camping excessively (canopy, tables...) but they warn you that you can't take anything out. Beautiful beach."
440225,3038070,5,paulapazmi,29/07/2023,"very good place to spend the night. quiet and no outside lighting. The local police come by to make sure people are normal, they don't want camping here or parties. there is a drinking fountain on the beach and a small shop. You have hardware stores nearby to buy camping gas bottles."
440237,3210353,3,Luke839418,24/08/2023,"We moved to this parking lot because the guarded parking lot was full. We didn't have a good feeling because the area didn't look very trustworthy. So we didn't walk, we called an uber into town."

Waves should not be underestimated, but life guards were there until the evening. There were a few other campers there, but everything was spread out well. We recommend!"
440346,3290523,5,lucreziatasca,13/09/2023,Stunning location! We spent one night here. The street lights in the parking lot remain lit at night but are not a nuisance. The bathrooms remain open 24 hours. We didn't use the shower because there was no hand shower. The place is beautiful and the beach bar in the evening is gorgeous. There is a tap behind the toilets which we used to refill the van's water tank.
440346,3286886,5,AileenP.,12/09/2023,"Top parking space right on the dunes, just 2 minutes from the beach. Toilets open all night, cleaned several times a day, cold outdoor shower next to it. Beautiful beach and deserted for miles. High waves. Stayed for several nights and will be back soon. What a great free service from the community. A big thank you for this great parking space."

Unfortunately, the lanterns burned continuously from around 8 p.m. On the one hand annoying, on the other hand we felt very safe!!! Toilets were clean and cleaned in the morning. We would recommend this parking lot."
440346,3219585,5,siggimueller,26/08/2023,Very nice place to stay. All available toilet cold shower and even a parking space for the bike to clean with water. A cozy bar where you can sit on a swing and watch the sunset. Is recommended...
440346,3214172,5,landcruiser55,25/08/2023,"We arrived in the afternoon and found a place very easily, since the parking lot is very large and because it is usually empty when people leave the beach. It has toilets that are cleaned by a lady every day. It has showers, and the streetlights are on all night. The beaches are very clean. At night you only hear the sea."
440346,3207606,5,alexisgl,23/08/2023,"Very clean place with few people in the evening. On the other hand, during the day, the car park is shielded.

On a Friday afternoon the cue was long, so skipped my LPG refill and did it near the recycling facility (where one can dispose of grey and black water for free) since I had to go there as well anyway. But otherwise, probably your average good gas station, so maybe 4 is a bit too harsh, other people will need to comment!"
440557,3157624,3,Jeanne2301,16/08/2023,"A great view, however it is quite noisy at night. A lot of cars come and go because there are restaurants / clubs that close late at night nearby. But if you are a heavy sleeper, no noticeable problem :)"

440672,3198602,5,KayLinee,22/08/2023,"We arrived at night and the magnificent view in the morning was a nice surprise! Beware, however, of the road going up from Foia, probably not recommended for vehicles over 6 meters, lots of hairpin bends, holes and quite low branches on the edges of the road."
440672,3052847,3,ImaGIN22,31/07/2023,"Superb spot, nature and mountains. Panoramic view. Flat area with shade and sheltered from the wind.

440755,3087843,5,Poladesiero,06/08/2023,"Perfect for going to the beach. At the end of July there was plenty of space to park... Beach next door, sinks, drinking water. You can park without problems, there are people who are parked for months without problems. The police don't go, they go to the other one next door."

440949,3292534,1,jlpc,13/09/2023,"The area is ok, somewhat inclined and only with the basics. The problem is why they want to relegate us there. On the road there is about 500 meters that could perfectly be parked if they did not prohibit parking for more than 2 tons. Next to the bridge there is an illegal sign prohibiting parking motorhomes. It is one thing to make an area to facilitate and another to want to lock ourselves in a ghetto and pay. That's why 1*"
440949,3277587,4,Gema-fg,09/09/2023,"Much to improve still. Open barriers so it's still free. A walk from the town, but it is not heavy. It is worth to visit it. Correct emptying and filling area. Land leveling Separation of plots. Without shadow. I don't know what they will charge in the future but the facility needs to improve a lot. You cannot ask for money for leaving it in a wasteland with a drain"

It is shameful where they have relegated us... they have closed the entire parking area with fences near the river and the center for NOTHING and they send the AC and the rest of the cars to take a place without any shade for sack... The city council does not deserve that we make any expense here"

Free area at the moment, filling and emptying service, two, no shade, gravel terrain, many squares all huge, 10 minutes from the center, beautiful town that must be visited yes or yes, we ate, We ate and drank the 2 days in the town, meaning that, whoever is concerned, we spend money wherever we go, not just those in hotels, take note to enable more decent areas."

440949,3189950,5,maciusutu,20/08/2023,"I give it five stars for the initiative of the Puebla de Sanabria city council for creating a much-needed motorhome area. It is not at the foot of Pueblo, but it is not as far as people complain either. What I don't like is the law that the City Council came up with not allowing parking in other places that still do not understand that 1 area is not an obligation but an option."

The authority refers to this corral, the vehicle does not have a bed, our objective is not the overnight stay. Where do I park to enjoy the river? Light vehicle <3.5T and not 2T!!!"
440949,3156664,4,BravoPas,16/08/2023,"You complain about vice, large area, 45 spaces, each 10 meters long, free at the moment, and less than €10 when it is running with services, fenced. Even so, it is almost empty, the previous parking lot full, like fleas and without services. Oh, and please, 1:20 in the morning is not the time to arrive to park, disturbing others."
440949,3156623,1,Samuelsa,16/08/2023,"It was clear that the previous area needed some kind of regulation, but it seems that the town could raise more by fining the uncivil in the previous free area, than by trying to hide and lock us up in this ""area"". I guess the only one that will miss us will be the old beach bar on the river, now ""Caparrota"". Knowing the previous area, this one is not even free."
440949,3153197,1,Estrellae,15/08/2023,"With children the walk to town can be more than half an hour. The river used to be close, now it's an easy 20 min. Not to return, a whole area prohibited from parking to scare away motorhomes."

440949,3130062,1,Azulazul,12/08/2023,"The worst thing about this area, in my opinion, is the concept itself. It assumes that we all want to spend the night in Puebla and eliminates all options. Where before it was possible to park without problems, now it is prohibited. In town, don't even try. If you come to visit relatives in the area, to a campsite other than the one in town, or simply to visit the castle one more time, why can't you?"
440949,3127162,3,sarabara,12/08/2023,"We arrived and found the barriers up, we asked and they told us that it didn't work that we could enter without paying. Large area, with marked plots, new filling and emptying service (2 stalls), but without any type of shade, at night the ares was filled (45 plots). River next to it to be able to take a bath with a beach bar. The historic center of the town 15 minutes walk."
440949,3123352,1,bgaraialde,11/08/2023,"I confirm and agree with what is reported in the previous reviews: dry, there is no shade, depressing, expensive (€9.75), without any aesthetics, payment with a card that is dispensed in a machine that does not work, it has services of water (less for the price). The previous area, already disabled, without being wonderful, better located, closer to the river and the town. Paying something more to the campsite."
440949,3121035,1,LAAUTOVIAJERA,11/08/2023,"One star for putting something, lost area and because they couldn't put it further away, charm none far from the town not a shadow and pay on top, another town that does not want motorhomes, the campsite is full there are no options if you want to visit such a beautiful town and we left without seeing him."
440949,3117874,1,MagosPorElMundo,10/08/2023,"Last year we were working in the Medieval Market of Puebla de Sanabria and there was a wonderful place for the public and merchants next to the river. This year we find ourselves with the surprise of this “area”, very much in quotes because it has nothing to do with it. Poorly located, without shade and as others say, depressing. It will harm the town, commerce and the Medieval Market, which is super well-known in this area"
440949,3088240,1,t334,06/08/2023,Very bad area designed by someone who does not travel by motorhome. I used to stop on the way to Galicia to spend some time at the river and buy in the supermarkets that were nearby. Now it is a depressing area that is far from everything so I will look for another place to leave my money
440949,3088111,1,Diego87,06/08/2023,"Horrible area, depressing place. The rate is abusive, no matter how much you load or empty water. The vending machine continually gives errors. More than an infrastructure for the promotion of motorhome tourism, it seems that its objective is to dissuade us from stopping in Puebla de Sanabria :( I hope they realize the mistake, it will only harm tourism and local commerce."
440949,3084780,1,bla34,06/08/2023,"If you don't want to pay, don't come, the whole area is marked with prohibited or uphill signs. If you want to pay, forget about the parking near the river, the new area is far, hidden, depressing, fenced and no shade. On top of that, you need a specific card and the machine is giving you problems, so get ready for an odyssey. Let's hope they notice our mistake and rectify it!"
440949,3081805,1,Uadyet,05/08/2023,"horrible, badly located area and far from everything, not a single shadow, before they let you park next to the river and it was very good with beautiful views, this is a secluded secarral without views, horrible, I only see the intention of collecting, I will not return, there is a thousand places where we are better received, you run out of tourism for my part."
440949,3064124,1,trintxer,02/08/2023,"Hello to all of these people from Sanabria, they are the ostia, there are 5 campsites and only 2 are open, one AC point and also closed and they don't let you sleep anywhere. The site is very cool but they don't want us to be sorry"
440949,3059398,1,LauraLosada,01/08/2023,"We have been following the indications of the local police, since as of tomorrow (2/8/23) vehicles of more than 3500 cannot be parked elsewhere. But we arrive and the switchboard doesn't work. You have to have a card that we don't know where to buy. The incident telephone number is French....in short. A fiasco. We return to the parking lot and take a photo of the switchboard."
440949,3048970,1,cesargasteiz,31/07/2023,"You start badly with 10 euros a day just to empty and load without a shadow. You could have put a little more energy into the area. I'm glad to have an area in a charming town but it's not just putting up a barrier and charging. I'll go to the campsite for a little more money and like more services. Greetings, thanks"
440955,3174445,4,eli18fdez,18/08/2023,"Access to here with large motorhomes is complicated but we managed to pass (7m), once there they don't tell you anything, there are no services but it is free and you sleep very peacefully, you are practically in the center of town. In a minute walking down a hill you are in the port and you have a supermarket next door."
440955,3163867,4,ciervalo,17/08/2023,Large field near the lighthouse. It is not completely flat but it sleeps well. Busy during the day but quiet at night

Once you have arrived, go up to the left, and to the right for cars over 7m the access is closed. No services. I asked a policeman and he told me that if it was not delimited, there is no problem. We'll see"

A little noisy at the start of the night because it's close to a busy street but that's OK for 1 night. 5 minutes from the historic center of Evora, therefore convenient for visiting the city. (It might have been better to park in the large flat parking lot opposite)"

441299,3178006,1,Gaetgob,19/08/2023,"Horrible ! Noise, a drunk punk motorhome, disco a few tens of meters away, parties in the undergrowth with lots of screaming young people... Lots of traffic and lights all night long! Impossible to stay! I don't see the point of giving this place on P4N outside the water point. We had to leave the place!"
441335,3045082,5,VicentBlasco,30/07/2023,"Washed in 30 minutes, I take the opportunity to do the shopping at Lidl, right next door. Large area to park the caravan."

441788,3266015,5,angelyandaceu,06/09/2023,"Perfect for one night. Quiet, wide and flat place. With the possibility of shade with large trees. There is a fountain with a tap on the other side of the bridge. Lots of cats everywhere."

We spent the night with several other vans. Very quiet, no noise. The boys of the canoes of 10. PS: super across the road the town 15 minutes walk"

442101,3076578,5,-LUCIFER-,04/08/2023,"a fantastic place to spend the day, take a bath in the Duero and sleep. There is a very clean public toilet, a bar with a terrace with good music, good prices and the guy who runs it is very friendly. The access is difficult but it is worth it, a place out of 10. With a motorhome, do not access from the town, they are narrow streets. Take the route between vineyards to the cemetery and from there go down."
442101,3052968,5,evouchou,31/07/2023,"magnificent view, swings hanging from the trees, but the place has to be earned... a few cold sweats to take the very narrow path! be careful... automatic watering, park to sleep beyond the green grass."

442109,3118979,4,JoaoELima,11/08/2023,"The photos are correct. The instructions confirmed by a Lidl employee say to ask, at box 1, to open the water which, according to the same information, is free."

When you drive there you feel like you're driving into nowhere, but as soon as you get to the promenade you see the wonderful place. Danger! There are 2 ways to get here - 1x through a very narrow 10km/h residential street but also 1x through a normal alley.. just turn left when the narrow alley comes and don't go in."

So, use the gas station somehow and then fill up the water. (I do not recommend it for large buckets since it takes a long time to fill it)"
442439,3261804,3,Fannyche,05/09/2023,"When we were there it was very windy, and it had rained the days before so access was a little complicated but doable by van.

There is electricity and water on site, but the discharge of water and toilet is also not properly regulated."

This area is worth a visit."

The pool needs some maintenance. The barbecue area is very good and does the service and has a good sports area."
443725,3181487,4,benikuki,19/08/2023,"We stopped at the campsite to spend a couple of days, and in the end we stayed for a week. Pros: large, shady pitches; two swimming pools (large and small); Mercadona just 200 meters. Cons: the pool could do with a renovation, as well as the toilets (the showers are already renovated). Despite the cons, we will return to the area and use the campsite as a base camp."
443725,3135357,3,MariaMAlberdi,13/08/2023,"Normal campsite. Clean and simple. The restaurant is only open on weekend nights. Fair but sufficient pitches (large motorhome) and leveled. The expensive bar with little supply. They charge you all the children equally, also months old babies as well as children under 12 without distinction, this seemed to me to be an abuse."

Very well organized!! You have to take care of these places!
443904,3195853,5,monik19390,21/08/2023,Quiet place without noise. A very welcoming town to spend a few days of disconnection. The mural route and visiting the town canteen are essential.
443904,3195775,5,AraceliBermejo,21/08/2023,"A fantastic place to spend whatever time you need. We have been to the Pollogómez festival and they have even enabled showers and running water for these days. At the bar Santi and Mari Carmen will welcome you with open arms to have a beer or eat a fabulous beef burger. Of course, you have to be careful with the locals, they can hook you up and dance until dawn ;)"
443940,3275666,5,Herdie,09/09/2023,Absolute parking recommendation. Even if you want to spend several nights in a cool spot for little money. The man in the ticket booth is super friendly and helpful. Beach reachable in a few minutes on foot. Would love to come back.

444301,3080620,5,JCG59,05/08/2023,We stayed there for 1 night with no problem. You have to get there in the evening because during the day the place is full of cars. There is the road which passes not very far but that did not prevent us from sleeping.
444303,3165186,5,Lounili,17/08/2023,"Very good location, we were alone, stone path but it goes very well in a 7 m motorhome."
444308,3228690,4,Inakicm,28/08/2023,"Day and night parking VERY quiet, spacious, flat, gravel floor. Negative comments about fines are FALSE, of business origin in local Campsites. Land owned by the Ministry of Culture (City Hall and Local Police WITHOUT Powers) CANNOT Fine, NOR Mark. PARK calmly, as the residents of the area already do, respecting Cleanliness and Order (NO CAMPING)."
444308,3192639,1,Josio,21/08/2023,"Forbidden to stay overnight, the police fine."
444308,3184392,3,canariio,19/08/2023,"Site removed from the center, but an option since if you arrive at the area that is full and the entire adjoining street as well, (although the police pass by and do not let pecnotate and even fine). Without services, only two supermarkets next door. quiet place to sleep but far from the center."
444308,3179386,4,EAP85,19/08/2023,"Ample dirt parking without services, quiet to sleep. In Consuelo Bergués street there is a bus stop."

No service but today it was practically only frequented by campers (about ten, but filling everything up could also accommodate 40). Quiet and peaceful at night, a bit far from the center (4km?) and from the closest beach if you walk around."
444308,3173699,2,Nico4298,18/08/2023,"One of the few alternatives to land in Santader in CC. Parking, far from everything and without interest. This city is beautiful, really a pity that we are not welcome. Don't even try to park anywhere else, the police are on a mission to chase you..."
444308,3168318,4,pansorena,17/08/2023,"The local police cannot fine for spending the night in this car park as it is not municipally managed. The nearest urban bus stop is 200 meters away, on Consuelo Berges street No. 22. (The buses run every 20'). N-43°28'42"" W-3°48'04"" Lines No. 1-2 run through the Sardinero, Paseo de Pereda, Town Hall, the entire city from part to part, the cost is €1.30 each way."

444308,3136640,4,phrd,13/08/2023,"Almost unique in Santander: very large, flat, gravel, quiet, free. On foot we took 40 minutes to go to the port. Perfect for visiting and spending a quiet night."
444308,3109155,4,Zelthia,09/08/2023,"In the absence of guaranteed parking lots in Santander, it seems that it fulfills its mission to visit the city. Nearby bus, Line 1, 2, and 13 pass nearby and leave you on the avenue of Playa del Sardinero. Taxi from the center here €6.20, another more direct option and not expensive."
444308,3101458,5,seniabogon,08/08/2023,"PS: There are no prohibition signs in this parking lot, nor is it true that the local police fine you for staying overnight. Another very good alternative to park and spend the night in a motorhome in the city of Santander. The parking lot is very wide and flat, it is next to a supermarket and a school. 300 meters away there are stops for the urban bus lines 1-2 that take you throughout the city and beaches."
444353,3274457,5,GodinhoShow,08/09/2023,"we stayed here one night, together with other motorhomes (there were 5 in total) it seems to be a future urbanization, but for now there is no construction, so it is a quiet area, easy access and 15 minutes walk from the beach."

Unfortunately there is no dishwashing option except for the grills with cold water. That's silly. The associated restaurant offers vegan and vegetarian dishes. Very nice crew here."

444770,3097708,4,Familie-De-Ron,07/08/2023,The campsite has just changed ownership. And they're not bad. The facilities need some updating. But the welcome is very friendly. The lake nearby is nice to dive into. There is also a restaurant on the lake. So ideal as a stopover or even to stay a little longer.

There is a nearby beach that we did not visit and the place is dusty, but overnight stays are allowed, there were about ten campers and motorhomes! We did not like the parking lot of the Burger King in Conil to sleep and we moved here, quiet night!"
444804,3160211,2,maceov,16/08/2023,"Magnificent landscape between ocean and cliffs. Indeed it is forbidden to park for vans... we tried it and no police. There was a lot of activity at the picnic tables, not very calm. Going to the end of the cliff, there is a shower to rinse off and below a ""wild"" beach"
444804,3103704,2,LaValentina,08/08/2023,"It's a nice place. Small beach, look carefully when it is high tide so as not to arrive when there is no longer a beach. A wonderful sunset. There are signs indicating that you cannot stay overnight."

The people who posted must have arrived from the Ranero side. The place is great, there is an infinity of spots, over several km. Attention, it is precious, mountaineer, please, with respect;)"
445328,3247305,5,MathildeCC,01/09/2023,Access must be done slowly but we got there with our non-4x4 T5. There are two small places in the trees to shelter from the wind. Close to the hiking trail to go down to the beach. Gorgeous.

More level areas and others worse. If you go with children it may be fine, because of its playground and its cafeteria/shop with almost everything. 15' from the beach on foot. Tram and bus connection nearby to go up to Sintra."
445769,3239483,1,FelixLimp,30/08/2023,"Our van was broken into and valuables were stolen. We made the mistake of parking way back, which the cameras didn't catch. If you park there, hide everything well, take it with you or park outside and use public transport!"

446014,3145795,5,SahaBP,14/08/2023,We stayed on the street that faces that point because we felt that we were very exposed in the middle of the lake. We slept great.

We slept there and it was great, if you go with dogs it's ideal because they can run freely without a problem. In the morning, we take out the table for breakfast, people walk by but very few and friendly. We recommend this place 100%, there are no signs in the area prohibiting overnight stays."

446464,3115690,5,park4nightrisc,10/08/2023,"A true paradise. Spectacular river beach for SUP and canoeing. The Wing is recent in the parking lot, it has few shadows and the water tap is old-fashioned and has no threads. it has only one hose like the petrol pumps. It is a very pleasant place, quiet and offers a real rest. I strongly advise."

The view from the camper and the sunset were priceless there. It is not necessarily suitable for extensive bathing. The path there is easy to navigate. We would come again and again!"

There is traffic of fishermen who come late at night and early in the morning but respectful and without noise that bothers. Good access and beautiful, there is a path to walk to the next beach and then return along the sand that connects."

Fairly flat ground to spend the night with some bumps due to the roots. Horrible smell starting at 1 in the morning because there is a treatment plant very close and a fishmeal factory. During the day it doesn't smell but at night it is very unpleasant. I recommend going alone to spend the day. Easy access with van."

On the other hand, the place is very quiet, indeed, but I think there is a strong reason for that. the toilets work, but the showers are non-functional throughout the area. I think because of the shortage"

KIND AND CAREFUL PEOPLE. we will return for sure"

It's not free as the owner indicates, you have to pay, but they give you vouchers to spend at their two beach bars, so that's great. The people who run it are friendly and with the way the island is for parking and so on, it is a very good option."

I recommend it 100%."

They charge €9 for parking but with tickets redeemable at the beach bar, for beer, coffee, sandwich or whatever you want, it's worth it and you sleep in a pine forest on the beach without noise or problems. The owner tells us that they don't know if it will be open all year or only in the summer season. Success for my taste in the area, we spent two nights."
453026,3232028,5,Hetmon,28/08/2023,"A very nice place to spend the night. They charge you €9 and you can redeem it at any of its two beach bars, Salitre, which is in the same car park, or in La Calita, which has a spectacular sunset. if you park near the sea, reverse gear, you will have sunrise"

Felix made room for us right away, and we can take out tables, etc. During the night you can hear the beach bar ""Las Rubinas"" and around 4 in the morning people came to sleep in their campers as if it were 10 in the morning. Otherwise great. You just have to be a little more civil. The beach across and 20 minutes walk from the lighthouse. Good atmosphere in caños."

453068,3229183,5,Maxdrive72,28/08/2023,"we had a great time, the manager Felix hosted us, allowed us to camp, even offered us electricity at a cost of 10 euros, the only problem is that there are no services and so on the second day we had to go out for the CS and in the everyone in the area has denied it."
453068,3228013,5,viajero2013,27/08/2023,"A great stay, unused hotel where the guard is Felix, 100m away there is an area to load and empty so you can stay longer. We have been delighted, safe and very calm!"

453356,3292459,3,JesusdeBina,13/09/2023,"The town is beautiful and the location is good. There is still no water connection and it is true that it has an electricity connection, but it is a three-phase plug, I had to leave because I did not have a three-phase to three-phase cable."
453356,3242127,4,J-LCastillejo,31/08/2023,"A small area with a future, it's a pity that they have not yet installed water services: on the other hand, the electricity column (paid) already works. Otherwise, there are 2 plots at different levels with a table available each. The town, a quiet destination, with good gastronomic offerings and many possibilities for nature activities. The 5th star for when you have water."
453511,3241934,5,Rober80n7,31/08/2023,"Very quiet area where we spent 2 days, it is a little far from the downtown area. You have an Auchan shopping center next door where you can shop and get WiFi and also refuel cheaper than at the rest of the gas stations in Portugal."

453564,3189857,1,MarieHaselmaus,20/08/2023,"Unfortunately, we couldn't find the place and drove aimlessly over dirt roads that weren't wide enough to stand on the edge. Too bad, we're moving on."

453852,3236360,3,Parker316,29/08/2023,It‘s okay. Some cars in the night driving by. It rains and we‘re stuck in the mud no way out. Maybe better tomorrow we‘ll see :D 6m camper. No problem to park. Just lots of mud
453852,3234825,5,ToniChornet,29/08/2023,"I've been in the parking lot for 2 weeks, I love this place with public toilets next door, showers 5 minutes away, just like the town itself that you have next door. The downside of the parking lot is that if it rains it fills with mud and that at the entrance there is an iron that must be taken into account to avoid puncturing the wheel."
453852,3221461,3,JanaNie,26/08/2023,Attention attention! A sharp iron bar on the driveway can blow tires...we speak from experience. Otherwise actually a very nice parking lot with a sea view and toilet across the street.
453852,3190724,4,Gypaetus_barbatus,20/08/2023,"We spent 2 nights. Although it is true that it is next to the road, it is a very quiet area to spend the night and spend a couple of days. It is 5 minutes walk from Zarautz"
453877,3279633,4,bartnikkels,10/09/2023,"Large parking lot with many flat options. not much shade and it can be very busy at times. So be careful not to get parked. Great for an overnight stay, but occasionally dogs barking in the middle of the night."

453910,3194667,2,Mhinojosa1982,21/08/2023,"I was very excited about this area because I love the area. But I'm sorry to say that it leaves something to be desired. It does not indicate the entrance to the town, although it has two possibilities, which is fairer. One on a hill (I'll try to go out there and it's possible that I'll rub), the other street with a regular turn and cross my fingers that you won't see anyone. squares without shade, tap without thread and push button, squares on a slope."
453993,3187933,5,RodolpheDfl,20/08/2023,"We had left to reach the site 200m before, but we clearly did well to advance a little on the way! We parked the van opposite the viaduct, we were the only ones to spend the evening and the night there. The trains pass every 30 to 45min but make almost no noise, you will be alone with the sound of nature!"

If you park in the marked area, behind the white line, there is no problem since the land is owned by an Englishman and he has marked some streets on the ground so that there is no problem. I have slept two nights and without incident. Very calm. 100% recommended."

454161,3267634,5,vdso83149,07/09/2023,"Magnificent spot! sheltered from the wind and view of the lagoon. There is a cafe nearby and trash cans. A bit of coming and going until the evening but that's normal, it's the beach. The nights are calm. We stayed there for 3 nights in early September. We sat near the small kiosk on the bend where I could do my yoga on the terrace. Nearest village: Alfarim."
454161,3244344,3,FurguiProl,01/09/2023,"Next to the beach, there were several vans sleeping so we decided to sleep there, no problem. In the morning, people get up very early to go to the beach, so you will wake up to the hustle and bustle of your own."
454161,3220132,4,soso33240,26/08/2023,Very clean and well lit parking lot. We arrived late at night so couldn't enjoy the view. There was quite a bit of traffic at night. People usually arrive around 7:30
454161,3198300,5,sandiapark,22/08/2023,"We have spent two non-consecutive nights here. It is a very comfortable car park with little influx of Van and AC. It has easy access through the urbanization and the area is very clean and well-kept (I hope it continues like this). If you arrive at sunset or very early in the morning, you have no problem parking. It is one of the best stops we have made, I highly recommend it!"

454282,3256691,1,Danielvera,04/09/2023,Nice place. We were told that it is a protected area and you are not allowed to spend the night here. The police also stop by and issue warnings or fines. We drove again.
454282,3255783,4,mlueders,03/09/2023,A spacious piece of land where many campers can spread out well and everyone has peace and quiet or company if they want. Great view!
454282,3241137,5,mgxmgxlp,31/08/2023,"Great location, we were in the middle of the “bush” with a sea view and we had a magnificent natural sunset. Be careful not to go too close to the cliff because there is a hiking trail that runs along it. Quiet night and waking up it's nice to go for a walk on the hiking trail"
454282,3229215,5,tobiloiby,28/08/2023,Many very nice pitches (each for one car)! You have to search a bit for it. The view is a dream. We drove about 200m further from the actual parking space! You can walk to the cliffs! It's a very quiet and unlived area. Later in the evening about 4 more campers came (they spread out well so we were more or less alone)!
454282,3225187,4,tikiT4,27/08/2023,Ideal location but avoid the concrete ground next to the highest ruin. It is a meeting area... and the notion of the first installed does not count: (yet there are plenty of places around!! Cleaning of the area on arrival because it is very dirty. However the next day new waste is left by our neighbors in at night. It's depressing. Higher up there are beehives installed.
454282,3211732,5,Diegzdu17,24/08/2023,"Quiet, secluded location in the shade of a tree. We spent the afternoon there and it was perfect for sheltering from the heat and avoiding the crowds."
454282,3206328,5,Fleff31,23/08/2023,"Great ! We met the local shepherd, he asked us not to make a fire. The cliff is magnificent, you can follow the fishermen's path to go to Lagos and Ponta da Piedade. Do not hesitate to look for other locations, there are several on this cliff."
454358,3215212,4,joanjo,25/08/2023,"Shared car park with tourist cars, ideal for visiting the historical complex of Sargadelos or walking along the ""Paseo dos Namorados"", which starts a few meters from the entrance."

No big external light, only small lights at the bridge to the water, so nice and dark. Disadvantage: a sewage treatment plant is close by and there was an odor from time to time. That's why I'm not staying a second night."

456756,3253978,5,MarisaMachado,03/09/2023,"We spent one night without any problems. next to the train station. In the morning, we moved to Sintra park to visit the town. Even though it is next to the station and a road, there is not much noise..."
456922,3255662,3,JoValVan,03/09/2023,"free spot with a breathtaking view of the port. On the other hand, close to an airport (fortunately no planes at night) We left our van at the end of the afternoon, there was a party which ended in the early evening... but it remained a small group of drunk guys who talked/argued until late at night. toilets and trash cans on site"
456957,3256705,2,akkarinonroad,04/09/2023,"€27 per night without electricity... the site is not maintained, uneven terrain, tall grass and very different and small squares. The good thing is that you have access to the campsite, bathrooms, swimming pool, supermarket, barbecue... correct filling, emptying and black"
456957,3246017,1,PetitPossl21,01/09/2023,I haven't been there yet. But is the €40 per night a typo or is it serious? I wouldn't come for a parking space at that price!
457038,3286485,5,cinziamax,11/09/2023,"beautiful place practically in the park in Iacente with loading and unloading. very nice town, it takes 10 minutes on foot."
457038,3241128,4,fermy,31/08/2023,"Good views, good area with loading and unloading of gray and black water, free, 2.4 km from the port of Combarro, where you can take the boat to see the mussel trays, €36 tasting trip per person, quiet night, just a little noise from the seafood factory. I recommend it."
457038,3222738,4,VaRoruiz,26/08/2023,Quiet site. It has a cafeteria nearby where you can eat at a reasonable price. Green area for pets and beautiful views of the estuary.
457084,3283933,4,msagnier,11/09/2023,Very beautiful spot with a view of the sea nearby. 1 star less because there is some trash and a strong smell of urine in some places
457084,3276983,5,Joshi4608,09/09/2023,"You can turn left beforehand, then you can avoid the steep section. Very nice place and very nice sea."
457098,3228157,5,nicola1759,27/08/2023,"Quiet place. Super shower and clean bathrooms, separate for women and men. The water is taken from a valve with a 3/4 female bolt placed on the garden wall. A large rubber hose or double screw is needed, games for children. We didn't sleep but I think it's very quiet"
457151,3247552,2,sytsewar,01/09/2023,not suitable to reach with the camper
457151,3221165,5,adeleitor,26/08/2023,It is a very quiet place to stop for lunch and you can also spend the night
457419,3287720,1,senorkimyo,12/09/2023,Actually the spot itself is great and has more than enough space to park but we weren't able to stay there because of the amount of mosquitoes... When we opened the door for only a few seconds over 10 mosquitoes have entered :/
457472,3240362,5,tikiT4,30/08/2023,great like the description.
457534,3236430,2,zntx,30/08/2023,"the parking lot is full of holes at the side of the road and the park4night point is not good, it's just before as you can see on the satellite."
457744,3280124,4,CapitanClick,10/09/2023,"We arrived after eating. There was no one in the booth and we went to bathe. Before 8:00 p.m., we asked at the bar on the beach and they told us that they charged it. The rates were €2 for cars, €5 for motorhomes and €8 for overnight stays. When I went back to the AC to get the money and pay them, they had already left. I have my doubts who this meadow is and what their rates are."
457757,3228275,5,Ariel76,28/08/2023,"We slept in 2 vans and without a problem, the next day there were two more. No Motorhome, space for cars. the excellent bar. a lovely walk to the port"
457899,3243946,1,mnlp,31/08/2023,In the photo it looks easy but access is very difficult. They have also covered the entrances with sand. It is also a natural park.
457899,3235293,5,ben45KTM,29/08/2023,"Superb spot, beautiful landscape and somewhat uneven but correct location. The place is not very clean so it is up to us to do what is necessary to prevent this from continuing, easy access and clean. Very quiet but very popular so if you want a good place you have to get up early. I highly recommend !!!"
457921,3280440,5,pat030,10/09/2023,parking 1€ plus free bus and possibility of spending the night WC at the back of the car park. Perfect
457921,3255195,5,MarzenaL,03/09/2023,"Parking in a perfect place for campers. Lots of space for vehicles of all sizes. There is a free bus from the parking lot to the center of Mijas, so no problem. You can stay overnight."
457935,3230295,5,maellemarine,28/08/2023,"Near the municipal campsite, very clean laundromat with washing machine and dryer. Very clean"
458105,3290045,3,deanyoung,12/09/2023,Next to roadway and passenger train rail. Noisy now at 8 pm but expect it to quiet down. Tough spot to get a bigger campervan into.
458147,3238046,1,LAXIENA,30/08/2023,"A few days ago this place was eliminated. and now they play it again but in French. Well, it's still very expensive. a nonsense"
458147,3238038,1,antoniaNavarro,30/08/2023,"Large parking, without shade, with all services, 45 euros per day, it doesn't matter whether you spend the night or not."
458305,3274749,5,irati.4,09/09/2023,"It's great, a quiet place in a small neighborhood in town. It is entered through a cobbled path under a structure with vines."
458305,3273764,1,Junior33,08/09/2023,Location not found....
458415,3291145,5,martinbarbosa,13/09/2023,"Free area on the river bank with water emptying and filling, we spent a very quiet night. It has a picnic area. to add a drawback that the filling and emptying of the waters have been placed right at the entrance and I imagine in summer to enter and leave the one that has to form because it hinders the entrance"
458450,3273006,1,ecotripfrance,08/09/2023,It is a private car park which belongs to the fire school just opposite. We asked the guards present if it was possible to stay there for the night but refused.
458634,3292476,4,Norasiri,13/09/2023,"Nice place with a great view of the lake for one night. The jetty in question is about 10 minutes away! Ideally only for a maximum of 3 campers, otherwise there won't be enough space. Unfortunately it's a bit difficult with dogs because it's right on a road with little traffic and there's only a trail for walking that ends in the middle of the mountains! But great for one night!"
458644,3240686,5,Costivan,31/08/2023,Everything very clean. They have air conditioning and a large shower with hot water. There is also a snack machine.
458863,3284343,5,jujyju,11/09/2023,"We spent the night here. Quiet place a few minutes from the port where you can hire water activities, eat and drink. A walk takes you to the center of Albufeira. There were other campers and motorhomes of 6 meters parked in battery. We had to park our 7.2m motorhome parallel to the road. Quiet road because at night tuktuks cannot pass."
458877,3257919,3,FranEncinas,04/09/2023,"Quiet area near the beach. If there is a fair higher up there is a lot of noise, but you can sleep. There are no services. It is a little far from the city to visit it. We went to the Nazer parking lot, which is also free and 5 minutes from the church."
458877,3247837,4,Pat4Camp,01/09/2023,"We are standing here with about 6 other mobile homes. There is a fairground within earshot (about 200m) up the road but otherwise very peaceful. The floor is a little sloping but not bad. Some make wedges, some don't."
458886,3242101,5,lidi_ss,31/08/2023,"Good place to stop and take the Zamans Mills route. We didn't stay to sleep but it could be a good option, very level and there are almost no cars passing by on the road."
459037,3266080,5,joebaronze,06/09/2023,Very quiet and just a stone's throw from the sea.. Paid parking from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and from 4 p.m. at €20 then it's free from 8 p.m. to the next day 10 a.m. €3.70 for 3 hours which you can pay remotely using an application.
459112,3266745,3,majaluisebastian,06/09/2023,"Beautiful place in the day and beautiful sunset. But we changed places in the evening because we just felt uncomfortable because of the cars constantly passing by, etc. Certainly just a personal opinion…"
459262,3270741,4,valegro,07/09/2023,"Beautiful place, very busy during weekends or holidays according to locals. It's a shame that they throw so much waste into nature, diapers, butts, etc. We collected a few bags of waste. The water is lovely, there is a swing rope and you can enjoy a nice walk up the mountain. We were a little further away at the next beach with the dam. People also slept in tents on the beach. Waste buckets available, unfortunately we use a lot of paper across the street. The municipality should install a toilet."
459428,3264197,2,Cancalo6,06/09/2023,"We were there with our van and well, the place is good to park and spend the night because it is 5 minutes from the center. Simple area The only drawback is that a young man came there to do botellón, in addition they called others and to indicate where they were they said: a las caravanas! Maybe someone should explain to them that if there are caravans it is because someone is sleeping in them. I'm already crying to the neighbors!!"
459501,3259560,5,acarballom,05/09/2023,We stayed one morning so we could go to the beach and the castle. Calm and without prohibitions. Leveled and paved.
459547,3255775,1,jyepes1,03/09/2023,yeah... no. uneven muddy parking with strong winds. the only reason to park here is to be able to sleep unlike the nearby lots which are full of bad reviews. however this place has the same sign as the rest and the Llanes police is infamous with Spanish campers for being vampire -obsessed with sucking fines out of everyone. didnt want to be guinea pigs so decide to leave. good for a day trip tho.
459619,3261510,1,anadeparte,05/09/2023,I just went and it doesn't work.
459750,3285144,5,Libelle99,11/09/2023,"Meadow area, instructions from owner very helpful. Quietly and safely stood overnight. 10 euros."
459750,3263101,1,Enriqueb,05/09/2023,"and why there is no less, the situation is very good, the entrance is narrow but with care it is saved, but if a furry person accompanies you, avoid it, or you will suffer harassment and demolition by the owner of the land, your dog will only be able to leave the motorhome with leash on your hand, having mine tied and me sitting outside, it caught my attention why I arrived at the next square, I'm not coming back, in fact I left without spending the night"
460091,3256738,5,park4night345123,04/09/2023,Nice spot to stay!!
460187,3263954,4,Jkbsc,06/09/2023,"The street is loud during the day but becomes quieter at night. Difficult to find a flat spot, but ok for one night."
460187,3258406,3,JolM,04/09/2023,In fact the parking is good... But it is forbidden to approach the Corniche... And the road is very busy during the day... So a real risk of crossing the road to go see the viewpoint. So only use when you have no other solutions for sleeping
460209,3289024,5,greenway,12/09/2023,Pedro the owner has been very kind welcoming me. Location close to all areas of interest. 100% recommended.
460266,3276183,1,asturlanciense,09/09/2023,You can no longer access the parking lot because they have put giant stones. It fits a couple of cars attached to the stones as seen in the fourth photo.
460266,3274680,1,marove90,08/09/2023,"Viewpoint closed to cars, no parking. It is not advisable to come with large vans."
460399,3287857,1,Xocasmadeira,12/09/2023,That address is wrong. That name has not existed in this council for more than 30 years. The place is called PASEO LITORAL.
460498,3262524,5,sunhole,05/09/2023,Very nice and clean. Cold shower outside.
460546,3262969,4,CarlosAriste,05/09/2023,"Stop to rest, stretch your legs, bike route..."
460613,3293863,1,Lorenap89,13/09/2023,"The place is beautiful but plagued by mosquitoes, impossible to be there when the sun goes down, we had to go somewhere else."
460613,3291805,1,Michel7034,13/09/2023,"It is noon, we have been parked with our 6.5m CC for less than half an hour, when the police ask us to leave immediately, threatening us with a fine of 200 euros. Stopping prohibited throughout the town except in a single paid parking lot. On the other hand, the vans were able to stay."
460613,3267074,4,SicEst,07/09/2023,"One of the most beautiful places we have ever been. However, we met other campers who reported that they had received multiple tickets from the police for sleeping in the car - despite putting away their camping gear. The penalties are relatively high, so it's best to get up early and get your car drivable, then everything should work out."
460613,3264928,5,PieraPrattki,06/09/2023,"Wonderful place to stay for 1 night!
Direct access to the sea and close to Cadaqués.

Just make sure you pack away tables, chairs or other camping equipment overnight to avoid problems with the police (it's a parking not camp site) !!"
460613,3263998,5,markoaround,06/09/2023,perfect! i recommend.
460661,3271320,5,okuparero,08/09/2023,Good place to spend the night and park during the day. Is free.
460671,3293912,5,tourneo17,13/09/2023,"We are spending the night here and it is a fantastic place next to the beach, an incredible sunset and good waves to surf. Of course, if you want the places closest to the beach, come early or bring an SUV to be on the front line."
460830,3278672,5,Xiroi,09/09/2023,"The owners are very kind and friendly. They have a paellero, a playground, a water intake, a swimming pool, and emptying of gray and black. You can see the stars and it has a metro stop 5' away by car. Close to the A7 motorway. Good resting point for trips. You can bring animals. Supermarkets less than 10' by vehicle."
460832,3266776,4,majaluisebastian,06/09/2023,Stayed here for 1 night. A bit uneasy as there was currently a festival there. But bearable. You feel comfortable and safe. There are both covered and uncovered places. Good for 1 night
460973,3293895,5,clemdasilva10,13/09/2023,"Stayed here during the week. A few young people until 1 a.m. and mountain bike rides in the evening, but very quiet to spend the night"
460999,3269183,5,BuYuBu,07/09/2023,Quiet place to park without problem. Respect the yellow line since parking is prohibited after an area ;)
461269,3272704,4,Camperchrizzz,08/09/2023,"Beautiful view, good food at Martinez, cable car departure station via Barcelona, hotel nearby"
461362,3290564,3,anarodriguescb,13/09/2023,"Calm and safe place to spend the night, right above the beach. The owner is always on site, which is good on the one hand, but is a bit intrusive... There are no services. The closest bathroom is the one in the cafe below, where you pay 1 euro for 2 minutes of shower."
461362,3287229,5,dialmeida,12/09/2023,We had a wonderful stay here! You have shades and near acces to the beach! The owner and his wife are very friendly and happy about caravaners visiting their place! Obrigado!
461362,3282753,5,Marius1893,10/09/2023,"Had a very pleasant night! Incredibly nice owner of the property, who gave us a very friendly welcome and was very helpful (took away our garbage bags and offered us fresh water at no extra charge. We had very nice conversations with him and he gave us valuable tips for the area and Portugal. Info: 8€ for 2 vans + there is the possibility of standing for several months"
461395,3295197,4,RemsMarts,14/09/2023,"Few places, superb view, little traffic at night, a little more in the morning, people taking photos of the view... the area seems secure and a little isolated (little access on foot) there were two other vans when we were there so it was safe."
461621,3278838,4,rk12,10/09/2023,"quiet environment, but a lot of noise from the store's air conditioning. I was able to sleep well and use the toilet in the store in the morning. great place for 1 night"

461863,3279857,5,libert1957,10/09/2023,remember to book! we will be on site from 01 11 2023! welcome everyone !
461894,3280173,5,carlosfraguasa,10/09/2023,The best is the municipal pool and total tranquility to spend the night. Squares without slope
461939,3280644,5,TereMartinez,10/09/2023,We parked like a camper for a while during the day to eat and be able to keep the dogs in a little shade. Outside the hustle and bustle of the city. Two streets below parking with sea views but it is next to the road.
462238,3284674,5,JJ2569,11/09/2023,It could make a real spot. There are flat but grassy and sandy places.
462322,3293172,2,mercedesbenz508D,13/09/2023,"The place may be nice, but unfortunately we didn't get there. The road has a few potholes and it becomes very narrow in some places. Only recommended for cars and small vans."
462322,3292265,1,Luca2212,13/09/2023,There is no road leading to this place
462322,3284924,5,tynaondra,11/09/2023,Lovely spot!❤️ We definitely come back!

462426,3286377,5,AntonioMineiro,11/09/2023,"Beautiful service area in the city center. It has large green spaces around it, with a playground and skate park. The north of the country is fertile in these services. Thank you to those responsible and those who look after these service areas for motorhomes."
462527,3289739,5,LisbethImNorden,12/09/2023,"Vera's parking space is really great and communication with her is quick, easy and very friendly. We found this beautiful place by chance and stayed for 3 days. From here you can get to Sintra and Lisbon very quickly and easily by Uber, which is really a rarity for a parking space for campers in this region. The site is beautifully laid out, every pitch has electricity, there are clean sanitary facilities and toilets and disposing of gray water is no problem. A small oasis just outside Lisbon and Sintra."
