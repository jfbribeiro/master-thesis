93413,2871619,1,Fercha,19/06/2023,The police came and gave me a penalty for staying over night. They arrived passing 10:00pm. If you don’t want to get in trouble better stay away from this spot. O

Going to sleep and waking up in our rooftop tent gave us an amazing view over the sea, Cascais and Guincho beach. If you want you can walk down a bit on the far end and enjoy the stars without the streetlight. There is enough room for at least 6 campers and is accessible by any car. The area is very quiet. When we come back to the Cascais or Sintra area this would no doubt be our sleeping spot again!"

93413,1395123,4,RiccardoAlborghetti,02/08/2021,"I don't give 5 just because the sea is not easily accessible, you have to do a half hour walking path and there is no beach. otherwise it is gorgeous"

93439,2589348,1,MariaG.,24/02/2023,Not suitable for mobile homes. It is forbidden. Rather park in front of Gibraltar and visit Gibraltar on foot or with a tour
93439,1782420,3,Kurrotom,13/03/2022,03/13/2022 parked from 11 am to 18 pm. Without an appropriate place for motorhomes and with a sign prohibiting overnight stays. It's just a parking lot.

93439,1625367,1,Sabali.RI,03/10/2021,"In all Gibraltar, sleeping in a vehicle is prohibited, Gibraltar prohibits camping in all its forms. Disappointed. Prohibido pernoctar en todo Gibraltar."
93439,1538538,4,erramonet,01/09/2021,"Very busy parking area for Gibraltarians who go to the beach, it is difficult to park with the motorhome although there is always room because it is large. Bus lines 4 and 8 are taken next door and they leave you in the center. The 4 in particular leaves you at the door of the cable car. There is a sign forbidden to stay overnight."

93439,1307276,4,_grendel_,09/07/2021,"Huge free square, close to the beach. A small playground for children. It can be noisy until night hours, because there is a lot of traffic - especially young people on scooters, driving to / from the beach, so it is best to stop for the night on the far left side of the entrance road (in the final row by the wall)."
93439,1121157,5,Insearchofsun,14/12/2020,Parked all day sunday in December in moho overlooking the beach. chap cleaning said ok to stay over night and it was quiet. had a swim clean water. the toilets were open but not the showers as was Sunday. 30 mins walk to centre. safe as all Gib is.
93439,758639,3,hansi-pe,28/12/2019,Good place if you like to  acess the beach. The sinks run with sea water. I was not to sure about the safety of my van. So I did not leave it alone.There is some container people living at the very backside of the yard. The police came for them in the middle of the night.
93439,743275,5,lewisstafford,14/11/2019,"Good for a night out of season. A bit far from town but walk is ok, only about 15-20 mins to the harbour and square. 

the showers and toilets were closed in November, which is to be expected."
93439,612844,2,bagamojo,09/08/2019,"Free parking on large car park. easy access to beach and paid shower 30p ( English money)

93621,746244,5,TheUglyCamper,23/11/2019,Really lovely spot and easily accessed from the main road. The views and sunsets are lovely and you can walk down a path to the shore. It’s incredibly windy so check the forecast before staying the night. The wind was so strong it moved the van from side to side all night and it took ages to start the engine in the morning because of the silt that had been blown in. On a calmer night it would’ve been perfect.

Possible to park 50m before in front of the bridges 3 CC max if space available. Nice little port, nothing special to visit but very pretty and good restaurants, access by a very cute little path in about ten minutes"
93633,2759315,3,HollyThompson,18/05/2023,The parking spots slope so if there's many people it won't be possible to get a flat space however I was alone (mid may). Had a crap night's sleep though because it's totally flood lit throughout the night. So depends on your van/camper. With tinted windows and normal curtains I struggled. Close to beach and sheltered from the wind though.

93633,1525089,5,MonicaVelasco,28/08/2021,"We have passed but when we saw that there was no one there, it gave us something to stay and we have left. but it seems a very quiet place. Quite a few gaps."
93633,1522986,4,SLMonedero,28/08/2021,Place without services but perfect to spend the night. The practically deserted beach next door. During the day a little noise from cars but at night super quiet. We were 4 AC and no problem. The little town that can be visited within a 10-minute walk has a lot of charm. A different and recommended place without a doubt. We came at the end of august
93633,1521518,3,Vito111extremaydura,27/08/2021,"Good access, quiet, proximity to the beach by a path and you can take dogs (a bit dirty). to spend a quick late-night fine. we arrived around 20 o'clock cars are heard"
93633,1466318,3,75849663L,16/08/2021,"We have parked with a not very large AC and well. The path to enter and exit is not very good but if it is not very crowded it is possible to maneuver well. Recommended to visit O Barqueiro, about 10 minutes walk."
93633,330882,1,laulau_29,13/08/2018,Bad. Lots of train and car traffic. Dogs that are wandering.
93635,2560742,2,Leila1879,26/01/2023,next to a road. cars go past till midnight and resume again between 5-6am. The cars make a lot of noise due to the speed bumps. there us a water fountain and park.

We advise you to go into the water with your sneakers and not to move the earth too much with your hands because small leeches could invite themselves to the party..."
93639,2036164,5,vstrxd,04/07/2022,"Extremely calm, rare passage of very welcoming locals, possibility of going around the water reservoir, observation of multiple birds, a very calm night. However, beware of cyanobacteria, I do not advise you to swim."

93674,2583886,5,aanaa_1992,19/02/2023,"Very quiet motorhome area. It has a gray water drain and toilet, as well as a tap to fill water. I recommend going out and entering from the top, since the other exit can cause the vehicle to fall due to the slope."
93674,2579690,5,Felix-L.,16/02/2023,The site is perfect for viewing the village and has water and waste disposal facilities. It is next to a road that is hardly used at night. In the village there are small supermarkets and other small shops. The fruit and vegetable shop is also worth a visit! Possibly the exit of the square with large vehicles should be avoided and rather turned around.
93674,2572310,1,egoman,09/02/2023,At half past two in the night a car came and parked with the engine running... I drove away!
93674,2555248,5,Barbaraj,19/01/2023,Does exactly as it says - small quiet area on the edge of the village. Is on the road but not busy all services bar electric - thank you to the village for this free facility recommend and would return

93674,2521602,4,Frankly_,14/12/2022,"Been here one night, village looks nice and has several supermarkets. The places are a bit strangely marked and I would not use the exit with a long camper because it is very steep. Only drawback is that it is located on a street that is relatively busy."
93674,2519362,4,dedegirard,11/12/2022,Very good for services and for a stopover...everything works so far....may be a bit close to the road...but since I didn't spend the night there???
93674,2511086,5,vincent_v2312,02/12/2022,Perfect to stay a night and empty your gray water and refill the regular water tank. The street to get there is very curvy due to being in the region of Sierra Nevada.
93674,2487288,5,Granzebru,08/11/2022,Everything you need is there and works perfectly. Right on the street but very quiet at night as there is almost no traffic

93722,2961888,5,amy2809,14/07/2023,"Very good spot! Certainly there is no direct view of the beach, but a wooden pontoon leads directly there. It's a sand parking lot in a dead end. By following the tracks of the tires we passed easily with our small van. It's quiet, with the sound of the waves and nature around. Watch out for the wind though! Fishermen and hikers pass in the morning but nothing disturbing."
93722,2738358,3,abebess,10/05/2023,Good quiet location. No sea view and the beach is pebbly. A little disappointed for the dream location.
93722,2571608,4,Berbel01,08/02/2023,It's easy to get to the parking lot. Unfortunately no direct view of the ocean. But for one night it is completely sufficient. Trash cans are available.
93722,2464522,5,AlexisSeymour,27/10/2022,the land is very nice the beach is really 30 meters away easy to access no getting stuck on our side only there was a lot of wind
93722,2084410,5,danisin,17/07/2022,Beautiful view on a minute walk to the beach (unguarded with stones). During daytime some other visitors but we were the only camper for the night (in july)
93722,1696389,4,ClaraRagg,23/11/2021,"The parking space is great and can be done easily without a 4x4. We were all alone in November. Unfortunately, it's relatively dirty."
93722,930793,4,FabioaufReisen,05/08/2020,"Great place with a great view, we stayed here for one night in our T4. Definitely manageable without a 4X4 but a bit sandy. The beach is stony and rocky but a super quiet place."

93722,640464,3,Sarahsunshine,18/08/2019,"Official parking for the beach behind the dunes! Very quiet, a few visitors. No view of the sea! Wonderful for one night."
93722,354392,1,Van.Cat66,26/08/2018,"Big problem, I'm on the edge of not recommending the place because we can stay stuck and for a long time. We do not even notice it but there are big sand holes that are smooth on the surface like a road, but no. Go further if possible"
93722,345285,5,VanAlain89,20/08/2018,"Very nice location along the dunes, few people in the week visibly. Coastline of pebbles and rocks where we can find various crustaceans. Be careful, however, while driving on this sandy car park where some traces have already appeared. To avoid that, follow the footsteps of other vehicles."
93722,328777,4,vinceandso,12/08/2018,Spot relatively frequented the we who nevertheless allows to appreciate in an exceptional way the sunset.
93730,1923610,5,Willemyno1,28/05/2022,"Nice quiet parking spot, directly next to the beach. The spot has many trees, so our van could stay in the shadow all day, and a clean public bathroom. From here it's 15 min biking to the center or walk a few minutes to a great fish restaurant. Stayed for one night with another van and a big camper."
93730,1648358,3,iagotome,17/10/2021,"Public parking, if you are lucky enough that there is shellfish you can check how the seafood is extracted by hand, but on the other hand it is the parking lot they use and you have the risk of not being able to leave until they finish working, which is about 3 or 4 hours."
93730,1315104,4,jpozroz,11/07/2021,"Nice beach, right in front of the car park, in summer difficult to park, if you arrive after 19:00, people are already leaving and there is no parking problem."
93730,1294333,3,willvy,03/07/2021,Authorized area for motorhome parking a little uneven but ideal to get to know this beautiful town. It is quite spacious. No further comments. They tell me that it is the ideal parking place to visit the Cíes Islands.
93730,910419,3,Lajofainita,29/07/2020,Easy to park in weekdays to go to the beach. Kitesurfing spot. We stayed 2 nights no problem. Loud gardening noises from the beach early in the morning.
93730,697931,4,panojas,20/09/2019,"On the beach, quiet parking (end of September). We did only one night, we were passing through, we slept alone. right next to it there is a bar and in front of the parking lot the beach bathrooms (quite clean) and open all night."

93731,1678805,3,zigeunerfux,05/11/2021,Very nice and quiet place on the river. Access is problem-free for normal camper vans and vehicles with some ground clearance. Not suitable for large Womos.

93734,437064,1,Sapeopreis.eu,06/03/2019,Very steep parking and lots of noice from traffic. Bad spot to spend the night. Can not recommend
93738,3290273,5,2smiles2,12/09/2023,"Perfect place to spend the night, you have an immensely large space to go with the dogs. It only has containers but for one night it is more than perfect"
93738,3290237,4,Ibonct,12/09/2023,"WARNING . This weekend I was there and saw how the ""minones"" police officers were from outside the area checking the license plate of a minicamper and I suppose that in the database it would appear as a tourist and they fined it. I would recommend that you take the Van outside during the day."
93738,3278760,4,JuanCrisyMaria,09/09/2023,"Comfortable, flat, quiet area and beautiful landscape."
93738,3237638,4,Ohana12,30/08/2023,"Highly recommended place!!! The only bad thing is that there are no services!!! But if you don't need it, you are next to the reservoir, full of routes and walks... it is very beautiful. The perfect overnight stay, several ACS very quiet!!!! We will be back!!! Thank you very much for this space"
93738,3225587,5,Charlie044,27/08/2023,"Perfect place to sleep, very quiet. Bins available WC 5min walk from the car park in the park. Paths for walking, beaches at the water's edge."
93738,3223814,4,VeronicaMG,27/08/2023,"Perfect place to spend a few days, quite level squares, quiet and beautiful area, I don't give it 5 stars because it has no services."
93738,3212277,4,aesteban91,24/08/2023,"Good place to spend the night, but without services, you have a reservoir next to it to take a bath open until 11:00 p.m. natural park, in the mornings the police pass by in the area checking that there is no one with chairs or tables outside."
93738,3205818,4,Crisss79,23/08/2023,"We spent the night here to visit Vitoria, we liked it a lot. Very quiet, 5min walk to the lake. There are many people hiking or bathing in the lake, super quiet at night."
93738,3199136,4,audreych53,22/08/2023,very good for spending the night too bad we were leaving the next day but lots of bike rides to do from this starting point.
93738,3174864,4,Freilikki,18/08/2023,"it is a parking lot, quite popular so the vehicles are parked tightly; so depending on your neighbors you will have a good night or not. wedges recommended. No service except garbage cans. In short, you will only come there because there are superb walks to do in the ornithological reserve (storks, herons etc.)"
93738,3173034,5,Christine31,18/08/2023,very nice thank you for this beautiful place. very accessible and welcoming.

93738,3121505,3,LvdD,11/08/2023,"A great place in a beautiful nature area (including a lake within walking distance). The pitches are not demarcated, so there could be more campers than there were (some have the awning out and table and chairs outside). We thought it was a major disadvantage that it remained restless until late at night due to arriving campers (with all lights on and motors running with a full tank)."
93738,3108100,4,lafamiliacamperina,09/08/2023,"We arrived last night and it was full, the plots do not take advantage of the space, people take out awnings and tables. We slept outside the parking lot, glued to the fence, and early we went inside the parking lot set up for motorhomes. We have to leave before eleven o'clock at night, overnight stays are not allowed inside. Great for lounging, bathing, and picnicking. Very narrow road access, be careful."

93738,3029909,5,LuchiLiu,27/07/2023,Idyllic place to rest and disconnect. The lake is just a step away and allows a good bath and water activities. It has trails for walking and cycling routes. Highly recommended.
93738,3024239,5,fvtamara,26/07/2023,"Area in an exceptional enclave, very quiet. It does not have services but it does have a clean point for garbage and recycling. One step away from the swamp and routes on foot or by bike."
93738,3023614,4,TasiS,26/07/2023,"I've been here twice. Everything was perfect the first time. The place actually deserves 5 stars. The second time, however, I was scared away by a very unfriendly Spaniard who said my van wasn't a ""real"" mobile home and I wasn't allowed to park here. I didn't stay, you don't feel comfortable with neighbors like that. Otherwise it's really a great place."

Reservoir beaches 7 minutes walk with many shades with grass and fountains, showers and toilets. On saturated weekends, we managed to get 21 vehicles inside but several stayed outside since the natural park closes at 11:00 p.m. Recommended place."
93738,2811762,4,Sorginbidaiaria,02/06/2023,"A fairly well leveled car park, with capacity for about 10 motorhomes, in a very quiet environment and next to the reservoir. The only drawback for which I do not give it 5 stars is the lack of a water change area"

93738,2299361,4,babela,25/08/2022,The site very well. But without any services. The police came in the morning to throw out the campers since it is EXCLUSIVE for motorhomes… very bad manners but without a fine. They passed around 8:30 in the morning. But the area is very good and the reservoir has a very nice bike route that goes around with different spots to swim. The swamp has restrooms and a sink for dishes.

93738,1975366,5,surroundedbydetails,14/06/2022,"5 out of 5, easy! The RV parking is located just outside the area which is nice because if you park inside, closer to the water, you’ve got to move out at 23:00. There’s a small bush path (150-200m) from the RV parking to the water. Even though it’s crowded you won’t hear a thing! No services, 5 minutes from the highway. If you are stocked up this is worth a 2-3 days stay. Highly recommended!"

93738,1518925,4,Freerules,27/08/2021,Quiet place to spend the night. Hopefully they delimit the plots because some incivicos occupy 2 plots. only for ACs and campers. they fine cars for aprcar. we respect these sites because in the end they will ban us.

As if they were in a campsite, throwing their bikes off the ground, children playing with the ball from all over the place and giving blows, it seems to be theirs. It's a shame."
93738,1137130,4,SadieDaisymoo,13/02/2021,"Very quiet. You probably could have got away with staying in the park with lake views as they didn't lock the gates but we stayed in the night approved bit, outside the gates as only here one night. Toilets locked, no facilities apart from bins."

North is just a little bit narrower. The place itself is nice, hardly any rubbish. It is quiet in itself, unless someone comes to watch or hike. The street is super loud to hear from up here, it's ok at night."

Words are short to express the feeling when you see the rising mist in the valley early in the morning. Windless and 24 degrees at the moment, some visitors. One or two model mills in representative condition, the others need a freshening up."

93881,512396,4,theroverlanders,11/06/2019,This would have been a perfect spot to spend the night except it was Portugal day and they were starting to get ready for a party so we didn’t stay. Windmills are definitely worth a visit though even if you don’t stay
93881,464967,5,lesmomos63,23/04/2019,"Wonderful place, very nice. If you want the view, little really flat place. We had a pleasant stay. There is water, trash, a little visit but we are not embarrassed. Nice place. We recommend."

93881,434651,5,atos1,28/02/2019,"A good place between the old windmills. Quiet except for quiet continuous noise from the highway in the valley. In the summer, a mill demonstration. Great 300 ° view of the tower. Access only from the south, in Gavinhos very narrow passage, not over 3.5t."
93881,425483,5,a666,29/01/2019,"Perfect. In case of wind (which is a bit logical), you can stay down on the square near the bar. Near the barbecue and at the bottom of the square, there are drinking water taps (good quality in May 2018)"

93894,2178365,2,MariayAlejandro,05/08/2022,"Nice area, very green, right next to the entrance of the mountain of sequoias. But at night impossible to sleep, you have the road right next to you and cars pass by constantly."

93894,1824530,4,juancu713,15/04/2022,"It is the main parking lot of the sequoia park. We have slept this past night with a California with the westfalia raised. The ground is a bit uneven, but a very quiet place to spend the night (despite being next to the road). The Civil Guard passed by a couple of times and didn't tell us anything."
93894,1694030,4,giiselasolis4,20/11/2021,"Good place, we don't know if you can stay overnight. Accessible for AC in the parking lot that is paved, although we had to park in the bus square because the car spaces are narrow. We only stayed during the day, I recommend that you get up early because otherwise you will not find a place (even if it is this time with low season)"

93901,3163122,2,littlejoe33,16/08/2023,"Very unfortunate because when we arrived at the spot (8 p.m.) there were 2 bikes tied to the trees as well as a car bike rack, certainly left by someone thinking that the place was dedicated to him. Really disappointed to see this kind of behavior because as a bonus full of fairly recent toilet paper left on the floor. I hope his ice cream was good at Tossa…"
93901,2588006,5,schlaraffenland3773,23/02/2023,"View and place actually 10 points. The place a little below directly at the power pole is much nicer and flatter than the one at the radio mast shown in the pictures. But the road has it all, first of all I got up there without any problems with a 6.50 long van without all-wheel drive, the first sight immediately shows a huge step, then there are curves with furrows and washouts. Just slow."

93901,1738978,5,marieremi,22/01/2022,Great spot but attention accessible only to 4x4. The slope is steep and the road is in very bad condition. Not accessible when it rains. The rains washed away the road. There are few pitches 1 or 2. The ground is not very flat. Otherwise magnificent views and lovely walks to Pola beach.

93901,996012,5,Django1602,23/08/2020,"Inaccessible place if you do not have a 4x4. With a ""normal"" camper you'll have a hard time ... don't get complicated. Recommendation, stay on the first antenna, if you go up to the second antenna, you will be inside the PEIN, and you may have problems staying overnight. From the first antenna you already have pretty good views."

I still had a good night."
94050,2315761,3,AlssndrG,28/08/2022,Suitable place to spend a night if you can't find anything better. The car park is large and flat. Easy access. A little noisy on a Saturday night. There are bathrooms
94050,2260865,2,watside,18/08/2022,"We stopped under the trees on the clearing on the left, before the bridge (on the opposite side to where the bathrooms and the beach are). We were right in front of the lake and the clearing is much cleaner than the rest of the two parking lots. In general, however, the spot is not to be considered in the midst of nature, there are several restaurants and the town is right behind. There is a lot of dirt on the floor."

You can SUP on the tributary river :) There is a restaurant right next door, which is totally authentic and offers very tasty local dishes. In the meantime, however, there is a sign that camping is prohibited. We were there from Saturday to Sunday and there were some pedestrians and people who were still out there, as well as the dogs and church bells in the area ... so it was not that quiet, but it could have been because of the Saturday evening."
94050,685684,5,happyb,11/09/2019,We stayed on the same trail further south at 100 meters. Wake up with a concert of rooster geese and ducks (small dog show in the evening until 23h). Very beautiful spot

It is attached to the road, you can hear a car passing but it is not extremely annoying, since there is not much traffic. It made us a bit windy during the night.

94104,3189169,5,Rpey,20/08/2023,"We paid €51.50 for one night, a camper van, 2 adults and 1 child. Very large plot with shade. The restaurant is very good. It has 2 pools. It is the second time that we stop and we like it a lot! Maybe it's a little expensive, but for the services it offers it's worth it!"

Two swimming pools, access to the lake on foot via the underground in 5 minutes, possibility of pedal boating, paddleboarding, canoeing... Spacious and clean sanitary facilities. Restaurant at the entrance (quite expensive for Spain). Small extra shop with bread and croissants. Quiet campsite, very wooded. Frequented by many Spaniards and Dutch."
94104,3024408,5,Erikadan,26/07/2023,"One of the best campsites we have been to. Very large and shady pitches. Clean bathrooms. Entertainment for children very good. They have a soccer field, basketball, pingpong... It's very quiet. Ideal to rest, and the children have a great time! The supermarket has a bit of everything, croissants and warm Neapolitans in the morning, although it could be a little cheaper."
94104,2987228,5,ngozokiyambo,19/07/2023,"A place that puts you out of time, with large plots, calm, with a superb lake next to it, access to motorhomes 7 meters ok; lots of possible activities in the campsite and at the lake, and walks around."

94104,2868572,4,MSGChemnitz,18/06/2023,"CP with all amenities you can imagine on a CP. Sani area with separate boxes including shower, washbasin & toilet always with cold / warm water adjustable. Places quite spacious with lawn and smaller trees. 2 pools and swimming in the lake complete the whole thing. Restaurant, the food is unfortunately only below average. Otherwise I would have given 5☆!"

94104,2770662,5,TheaDriessen,21/05/2023,"Out of season and with a special discount for €23 a great campsite. Beautiful location on a lake where you can swim well despite the fact that no one does that in May. Clean, good and spacious sanitary and other facilities (covered bbq areas). Also quiet on weekends and with 1 of the 2 swimming pools open. Will be very different in high season given reviews..."
94104,2676651,5,mackj1,17/04/2023,"Very nice place, clean, to feel good and relax. Quiet at night, you can hear the street during the day, but it was fine for us. The staff is very very friendly and helpful. The toilets and showers are pretty, colorful, some very spacious and really sparkling clean"
94104,2670021,5,fkoerner,14/04/2023,"Very nice campsite, very clean, great playgrounds for the kids. The pool was still closed. Very nice staff, heated and clean sanitary facilities, washing machine (5/7€) and dryer (1€ per 15 minutes) available. W-Lan doesn't really work, but that's how it is at every campsite. Prices for food etc. are okay. We paid €30 per night with a camper, 2 adults and 2 children (5 years)."
94104,2401354,5,HubertStrobel,25/09/2022,Beautiful place super located friendly reception everything very clean and quiet We have been there several times and would love to come back
94104,2216947,2,mchicoc,11/08/2022,"The lake is very nice. To get to it you have to go through a drainage tunnel from the road. Practically no coverage from Movistar or Vodafone and derivatives, Wi-Fi speed in reception 12mg, in my plot 2mg. Where there is more speed is in the pool below. Where no one complies with the rules despite being very clear on the poster. The bar is fine. The store, 1.50 a loaf of bread and at 11 there is no more ice. By the way, at night the bread is like a javelin, hard hard. The bathrooms, despite the efforts of the cleaning team, it is impossible for them to be clean and for the showers there are always queues. The personnel is very friendly. The plots some with enough shade and others like the desert. Water and electricity connections quite far away, a large extension cable with an adapter is recommended. Then the rest is good at night, little or no noise."
94104,2161430,3,marcdop,02/08/2022,"Campsite next to the road. To cross the lake you have to go down a tunnel that is not very well equipped. The camping store is very expensive and there is no other nearby, few products. Correct bathrooms, they are not always clean and the drain smells a lot despite being open. Land plots."

94104,1456956,2,Ricardsc,14/08/2021,"It is not what one expects for the price, plots with a lot of sand and stones ... the pool is not dimensioned for so many people, it is like being in a soup, what a lot, it has two pools of a chale size we have paid in advance and we have not noticed more agility, it has a lake that crosses in front of it at a low level that is horrible with various piss and stools, a shame .."
94104,1436995,4,Arkacaracol,10/08/2021,"The campsite in general good clean bathrooms and large pitches, the SPA closed due to the pandemic. The lake activities can be improved, very old and neglected mini golf, the park for children also neglected, skates and canoes well."
94104,1331219,4,Bulli64,16/07/2021,"Nice campsite, the pitches are pleasant, prefer pitches far from the road. The pool is very nice. Maybe a little expensive! 43 € per night 2 people and a Van."
94104,1328194,3,Pascapech,15/07/2021,"Came here based on the reviews, big disappointment in terms of location and really too expensive for what it is. Campsite is located on a very busy lane, very present in terms of sound, 1 of 2 swimming pools is right next to this lane. To get to the lake you have to leave the campsite and go down the track. Resto is uninviting next to the driveway. 43 euros for 1 night (camper 2 adults)."

The price according to the quality of the service. And the state of the underground passage to the lake is not their fault but who manages the roads. We will be back without a doubt !!"

94104,1090410,4,PetroT5,12/10/2020,Excellent. Clean facilities with electricity and water in many of the plots. Perfect bathrooms and a lot of tranquility. Campsite somewhat away from the town but perfect to rest and stroll along the lake in front of it.
94104,827253,5,angelfajo,17/06/2020,"We stayed for a weekend as soon as we could get the AC after the confinement. We wanted a campsite to enjoy BBQ, hammocks, etc ... we chose this one because it appears in the ACSI GUIDE and it offered a 2 + 2 discount with light and Motorhome for € 27 per night. The camping is very good. The staff is very nice and the cleanliness is maximum. We will be back."
