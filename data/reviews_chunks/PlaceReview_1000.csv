23257,3226632,5,cdiaz.casado,27/08/2023,"The most ""cute"" campsite we've seen so far, very nice and familiar. Very clean and well located."
23257,3220899,4,thati,26/08/2023,"Beautiful campsite, small but very cozy and quiet. Very close to the town center, you could walk with a walk or by car 3/5 minutes."
23257,3169644,5,HenselGretel,17/08/2023,"Well maintained campsite, very pleasant bar area, excellent pizza. Friendly and courteous reception. Honest price for car with beetle. Of course, there are only 2 bathrooms, but in the area this is the best you can find!"
23257,3091375,4,RafayRosa2,06/08/2023,"We were at the campsite for two nights and it was very good, it is a very nice, pleasant and cozy place. The only thing is that the facilities are very limited, for example in the women's bathroom there are two toilets and two showers and if the campsite is full it is not enough, not to mention that they break... otherwise it is worth 29.50 just the stay and then you have to add the supplements you need"
23257,3075511,4,yentl119,04/08/2023,"beautiful and well maintained campsite. We stayed 1 night. We paid 29.50 euros for 2 people without electricity. We thought this was on the high side and therefore drove on. There are only 2 showers and 2 toilets on the campsite. We didn't eat at the pizzeria, but it looked very good! in short: fine for a night."
23257,2985685,4,DaniHerre,19/07/2023,"We spent one night, a very clean campsite, there are not many spaces, it is small. At night there is a pizza food truck, all very good. There are toilets, shower and swimming pool."
23257,2817272,4,Antiquitaetenpartner,03/06/2023,"Great facility to find peace, very clean, small pool and no noise from the neighborhood. Prepared with a lot of love, in the evening with cocktails, pizza in small hospitality. We're staying a day longer."
23257,2793295,4,AuerRoswitha,28/05/2023,Very nice place not far from Mojacar. Well-maintained complex with beautiful sanitary facilities.
23257,2789724,4,Lucana30,27/05/2023,"Very good campsite and relatively large pitch. The toilets are very clean and there is a small petanque court, a swimming pool and very pretty and well decorated place. The village of Mojácar can be reached on foot from the campsite ""about 30 min""."
23257,2764919,5,Bernhardcamper,19/05/2023,"Very, very nice, individual place. Street not as loud as stupid, nocturnal barkers from other campers. It doesn't have to be, we just had bad luck. We were there for 5 days and otherwise felt very, very comfortable. You can see the personal handwriting of the owner, no place off the peg! We were now 3 weeks in Spain, for us it was an absolutely recommendable place! Greetings to Geli!"
23257,2712748,5,jojoguitare,01/05/2023,"very nice very clean despite its age the landlady welcomes you very nicely small but pleasant swimming pool, campsite very well placed to visit mojacar to do again without hesitation 33€ a bit expensive in April but! it's the holidays"
23257,2692888,4,wilsr1,24/04/2023,"Great site, lovely pool, lovely different sizes of pitches, easy access. We rate this as one of the best sites in Spain. Word of warning though, it's much cheaper to run your fridge/freezer on gas. The electric charge is a bit steep at 5.50€ a day. Next time we visit, we'll not ask for electric."
23257,2585917,1,zenruffinen,21/02/2023,"19.50 euros plus 5.5 euros for electricity for a cc in low season is exaggerated. Staff not welcoming, who speaks only German. Washing machine with a token at 4 euros. If you exceed an hour of washing the machine stops and there is no way to open the door. You have to ask someone to come but during opening hours from 10am to 12pm and from 5pm. No dryer."
23257,2550970,4,philplo,13/01/2023,"nice little campsite, you need a vehicle to get around or take the bus. the city of mojacar deserves to walk there. the toilets are very clean, with few cubicles and no closed washbasin. the water in the showers is very hot. price for us: 7 days= 189€ CC 2 Pers."
23257,2545785,3,familieHommes,07/01/2023,"great campsite, all facilities are there. Beautiful decoration. Unfortunately very expensive. Almost 40 euros for camper, 2 people and 2 kids and electricity. This is a real shame, because the terrace / restaurant is closed almost all day. No sandwiches and no supermarket within walking distance. Cycling to the city is tough, but good bus connection. Owner works hard and is friendly."
23257,2524754,1,argentdouble,19/12/2022,"Not fair pricing. 22.50 € announced, On departure and with payment by card another 10% tax, so finally paid 24.75 €."
23257,2501834,5,Vagabunden,21/11/2022,"Small, quiet place. The white village of Mohácar above can be reached on foot or by car. Easy access to the beach, bars and shopping with e-bikes. Pizza truck only in summer. Nice German operators. One lives with her husband on the adjacent land with the olive trees. She sells the cold-pressed oil from her unsprayed olives. One more reason to go there."
23257,2461049,5,coraline31,25/10/2022,"Small family campsite arranged with great taste. Toilets and showers like at home comfortable and clean. Beautiful environment. We had the bikes to get around, 1 km to go to the village of Mojàcar and 3 to go to the beach."
23257,2402825,5,schrauberlaube,25/09/2022,"Very cute, family and quiet campsite, everything very clean and tidy, 22.50 for a night without electricity for two is absolutely ok for everything around it, highly recommended."
23257,2336554,5,jessijuan,03/09/2022,"It is a very cozy place, the owners are very nice and you can dine in the food truck that makes salads and Italian pizzas, the best thing is the tranquility that exists throughout the day, very clean bathrooms, the only bad thing is that there is no supermarket for buy when you have an emergency, for everything else of 10. We stayed for one night and we have been 5 days."
23257,2281530,5,silviamdlp,21/08/2022,"We spent one night and it's great, it has a pool, we took a shaded plot, they have light in some, the bathrooms are super clean, they have a food truck that makes some delicious pizzas and the campsite manager is wonderful. It's worth spending here a few days."
23257,2224020,5,dadoncamillo,12/08/2022,"Very lovingly designed place with a beautiful pool and very inviting bar area (pizza from the food truck really fantastic!). Very nice reception and good wifi. Sanitary facilities newly made, very modern and always clean (although unfortunately only 4 showers and toilets in total). Plots level and very pleasant with fine gravel. Lots of shade from trees. Unreservedly recommended."
23257,2215057,5,cocoloko,11/08/2022,Superb camping to visit mojacar
23257,2203327,5,Sunbird444,09/08/2022,A very likeable small campsite run by Germans. I can only recommend it. At the moment there is excellent Italian cuisine from a pizza food truck positioned next to the bar
23257,2165348,5,lazarocaceres,03/08/2022,"Tiny campsite with a super friendly treatment, cool surroundings and decorated with a lot of charm. The toilet area very careful and all the new material, the washing area very comfortable and new. The treatment of the owner is the best. Be sure to stop by the pizzeria that they have in the foodtruck, it's been years since I ate such delicious pizzas."
23257,2101292,5,EstefaniaMens,21/07/2022,Quiet camping and environment and special decoration !! Very familiar treatment and to finish crowning the pizzas of the foodtruck very good! We will come back for sure!
23257,2088808,4,kohlsberger,18/07/2022,"Very simple, clean and pleasant campsite to stay at. The staff is very nice and uncomplicated. We had a very good experience, recommended."
23257,1833333,1,8_MPC,18/04/2022,"They don't let you change the water if you don't stay to sleep, not even paying. The lady directed us to the gas station, saying that it could be done there and it is not true."
23257,1816920,2,Dargo34,12/04/2022,very expensive for what we offer! 30 euros per night without services and 6 amp electricity which only cuts out! only 5 liters of water per day! they exaggerate since they are the only ones towards the village of mojacar .....
23257,1732367,1,newtomotorhoming2021,11/01/2022,"A good location for Mojacar but poorly maintained facilities: drinking water limited to 5L per person and only accessible from large container; four toilets and four showers; mens toilet ran out of toilet paper; electric fused out overnight; grey waste only accessible by lifting heavy metal cover. We were quoted €22 per night all inclusive via Whatsapp, but charged €29.15 for one night."
23257,1731552,2,Symba01,10/01/2022,Piled on top of each other. Very few sanitary facilities. Very expensive for what it is: € 29 in January for one night in a van and two people. The only advantage is the proximity to the village.
23257,1724384,5,priyavishwa,03/01/2022,Beautiful location and very kind and friendly staff.
23257,1707893,3,philippe9194,10/12/2021,"A very pretty campsite, not very large, with separate plots by hedges. The sanitary facilities are modest, small and old-fashioned. The high price for the service, over € 28 for a motorhome with two adults, is a lot."
23257,1594454,5,campiquipugui,20/09/2021,"We found it to be an excellent campsite. Well defined plots with privacy. There are some trees that provide shade, I guess it depends on the plot. With a bar and an ideal pool to cool off. Very clean toilets and showers. Very close to the town of Mojàcar. We paid € 31.5 1 night 2 people with fire and electricity."
23257,1584356,3,alexgari,16/09/2021,"Everything correct, clean and friendly people. € 27.5 / day for an AC and 2 people. Little shade but with a pool. Near the village."
23257,1559490,5,jc.pedrol,08/09/2021,"Very pleasant, very quiet campsite with very friendly staff. Swimming pool small but very clean and in a nice setting. Very practical food truck with good pizzas. Well-kept sanitary facilities."
23257,1517519,5,dasaf,27/08/2021,"Very nice, small-scale, relaxed campsite."
23257,1508189,5,bananeta_van,24/08/2021,Very good staff and treatment. A quiet place to spend the night. And priced the best in the area. With one of the best pizza trucks we have ever tried. We will return without a doubt
23257,1499647,4,bekuss04,22/08/2021,"The campsite is small and cozy, simple and very comfortable. The trees are a bit poor, some, it seems they need more watering… .The town is nearby, you can walk. Pool to cool off. Very calm. The atmosphere at night is very cool with the pizza food truck"
23257,1456123,4,Tritxe,14/08/2021,"The campsite is small but it is very good for a couple of days, it has it very cool, chilout style, the pizza truck a hoot, near the town although there is a bus that passes in front of the campsite."
23257,1449727,5,campervwc,13/08/2021,"We have spent one night. Correct sinks. Good atmosphere. Swimming pool, 15 minutes from Mojacar on foot. There is a food truck to eat and a restaurant. Very friendly at reception"
23257,1433377,2,jjmarina,10/08/2021,"As far as communication is concerned, this is not their strong point After several attempts to call and send a message, the person finally answered me on the phone to tell me that it was full"
23257,1432516,5,ambuHendriks,10/08/2021,Wonderful campsite. Very friendly staff. Proper sanitary. The pool was great for the kids and the food at the Food truck was sublime. Very relaxed atmosphere at the bar. Recommended.
23257,1377876,5,foliefurieuse,29/07/2021,"Great little campsite, very quiet and relaxing. very nice staff, the pitches are spacious and the sanitary niquels. The bar is very nice. Possibility to eat at the food truck. Beach 3km. I highly recommend !"
23257,1334201,5,odp,17/07/2021,Don’t care about the 1star for the one who just want to clean his gray water without staying ! best place in spain except if you like camping with 200 more places …
23257,1334191,5,odp,17/07/2021,"The nicest campsite we have done in Spain by far! small (about twenty locations). small pool like home super clean. collective barbecue with plates and crockery (for you in a tent) a restaurant bar area. under the pines, a garden decoration to die for, a wood-fired pizza truck… 1km from the superb white city. we had to stay 1 night we stayed 3"
23257,1119198,1,hponwheels,04/12/2020,"The owner is not very friendly, totally disinterested! He only wants to speak in German, not in English / Spanish. The services are only for clients who sleep there !! it is not possible to just discharge and load water! not recommended"
23257,951933,5,Pascualin,11/08/2020,"With all the necessary services, super charming and very cute ... Super happy with the treatment"
23257,661287,5,varitux,26/08/2019,"Curious and endearing, it is small, cozy, quiet, has a boemio and beautiful touch, everything is in order. Perhaps it is not the best place to empty the Grays Ac, you have to lift a floor cover, for black (potti) if there is. I also had to separate some branches while passing through the Ac, but great for me."
23257,624333,5,solrac,13/08/2019,"Small and very cozy camping. The guys who run it are very helpful and keep the campsite clean. For my taste, the trees are still young and do not give much shade. Beware of the summer heat. But I recommend the site. It is 10 minutes walk from the town of Mojácar. It has a table of ping pong, petanque, swimming pool, hammocks, chillout area and barbecue."
23257,233354,4,gummimaenchen,04/04/2018,Great place. About 10 minutes {steep uphill} from Mojacar.
23257,216812,3,chiefmonkey1,31/12/2017,Pleasant little site with nice views. Plenty of hot water and very clean shower block.
23257,213773,1,naseor,06/12/2017,Camping very uncomfortable to maneuver. The hard branches of the almond trees border all the ac. Terrible emptying and filling services. Emptying grays there are not and to fill this in bad conditions. The receptionist very unfriendly. Very expensive for what little it offers
23257,176081,1,davide28,15/08/2017,Closed from end of June 2017 to end of September. No use if you're in Spain for summer holidays.
23258,3286839,5,RoadAmRu,12/09/2023,"100% recommended, that is, if you have a minimum stay of 2 nights. Toilets, showers, laundry, sink, access to the beach directly through the tunnel, surveillance at night so as not to disturb. All types of services for campers and motorhomes."
23258,2985125,5,equipodobleA,18/07/2023,"Pretty good campsite. Showers and sinks good, always paper and clean, spacious pitches. Close to discos and pubs but they don't bother."
23258,2606445,1,juanjoysandra,12/03/2023,"There is no electricity in the entire campsite or in the toilet, nor toilet paper. The price quality is very low. It is like paying €30 in a Camper area just to sleep"
23258,2554017,1,gozo,17/01/2023,"The only positive about this site is it's proximity to the beach & Mojacar Playa. It is expensive (€28 per night, €4 extra for electric) dirty, neglected & no hot water for showers. Shame as with some investment could be great."
23258,2521116,1,JoanneWright,13/12/2022,"I was passing today on foot and popped in to ask how much for 1 night for 1 person with a small van, the lady on reception said 26euros. I didn't ask whether that included electric, I did ask if I could pay for a shower and she said no! she was blunt and not very friendly but can't comment on the site itself"
23258,2407110,2,Pamifive,27/09/2022,"To begin with, the price has nothing to do with what the campsite offers, the bathrooms were not in their best condition, there was no toilet paper, and to top it off, the women's bathroom was closed, we only spent one night and no more, €28 per two people and a car, the attention of the reception was quite extreme."
23258,1955611,3,Leaa,07/06/2022,"Camping very left: it shows both in the facilities and the attention of the owners. They only care about charging the minimum distance (two nights) and they do not inform you of anything: you only have to guess for yourself the access to the beach by tunnel and the bus schedules. Clean toilets, lots of shade and a cool beach 50m away. In a nightclub area with very loud music, Sunday too. Monday better."
23258,1898413,1,RichardWestcott,18/05/2022,The reception is enough to put anyone off and we didn't stay. Miserable isn't the word! Muy cutre.
23258,1774096,1,Nickz,05/03/2022,32 Euro to empty toilet - avoid
23258,1771220,4,JK1,02/03/2022,"Credit card accepted on March 2, 2022"
23258,1730914,3,okf,09/01/2022,"The atmosphere on the square is very nice and relaxed, but the square itself is the most expensive on my trip to Spain so far. I think 22 euros for a person in a mini camper without electricity is too heavy. Sanitary facilities old but ok. Location halfway on the beach too. Too little sun for winter camping."
23258,1728154,4,rosinanteontour,06/01/2022,"I don't even know why such bad reviews are given here. The sanitary facilities are older, but they were very clean. One night with electricity 2 people with dog 32 euros. Well there are cheaper places of course. We found the price / performance ratio completely ok. Beachfront location with direct beach access. You can also just stay one night and take advantage of everything."
23258,1710478,1,max3,15/12/2021,"You can not emty tank and filling water if you dont stay here.
Not very friendly staff."
23258,1709404,3,Type,13/12/2021,the price is a little too high. Otherwise it's OK for one night. Appropriate ...
23258,1705708,2,SoulMo,07/12/2021,€ 32 in low season. The most expensive of the entire route through Andalusia. Clean services but they need a brutal maintenance. I would not pay more than € 20 ... Pitches with a slope.
23258,1615212,3,jovita,28/09/2021,The campsite has a great location because you have direct access to the beach and there is a bus service to go up to Mojácar plueblo. The rest we cannot say much because being low season they had everything closed. The services were quite clean.
23258,1433392,1,jjmarina,10/08/2021,"As far as communication is concerned, this is not their strong point After several attempts to call and send a message, the person finally answered me on the phone to tell me that it was full"
23258,1092183,1,sebastienponcin,13/10/2020,"Too bad we didn't take the time to look at the reviews before going to pay. We spent one night, 12 € the place 6 € x 2 people 4 € electricity = 28 € and for that price you have nothing, not even the smile of the owner. I strongly advise against this place."
23258,840602,2,prbugnon,28/06/2020,"EUR 32.- for one night for 2 people, a little expensive after confinement! Electricity and shade. Correct 4G network. Not worth more than EUR 20.-"
23258,758820,4,7g7g,29/12/2019,"This place is expensive if you stay less than 7 nights. 2 people and electricity 25e. That reduces by 15% after one week 30% after two weeks and 50% for a month. The plots are large and flat but little sun  basic but hot showers and no loo roll. yes the bins are emptied in the middle of the night twice a week. The positives of position to bars, shops and beach outweighs the negatives."
23258,737978,5,maguforever,04/11/2019,"Normally I do not drive on campsites that are rated so bad. But if you read through the previous speaker you quickly realize that the least really have something to do with the campsite. The place is great. The place is right on the beach, you can use a tunnel and is right on the sea. Like a private beach. Why do you need a pool? The sea currently has 21 degrees in November."
23258,724452,1,AntonioPinilla,18/10/2019,"I called to dump dirty water, empty toilet and refuel fresh water. And they do not have the service. Minimum stay two nights and very expensive, then they have the service. A disco right across and very very loud so no recommendation"
23258,661256,1,varitux,26/08/2019,"Little to offer when you go by motorhome. The minimum is 2 days, it does not work if you are on the road. It has no pool."
23258,630320,1,Veta,15/08/2019,"We called to know the cost of emptying gray and dirty water plus the filling of clean and said they did not have that service, that we had to be one night"
23258,297914,3,Rollo498,23/07/2018,"Camping very basic, but during the week it is quiet, it was minimum two nights, but they let us stay only one, € 39 with electricity and 3 adults, super clean toilets."
23258,159590,1,lolopepin,28/07/2017,"Payment on arrival (59 €, 2 people, 1 motorhome, electricity) for 2 nights mandatory. Nice camping day, close to the beach and infernal at night (pickup trash at 3am in the alleys, nightclub nearby)"
23258,98324,1,peptornel,21/08/2016,Very very shabby! It has no pool and very fair services !!!
23258,46573,2,familitortatomi,06/08/2015,Camping very noisy since there are several clubs nearby. The services just and the only good thing is the beach at 100 meters. To be patient one night in summer !!!
23265,3157757,3,mirketto95,16/08/2023,Beautiful place on the sea but camping is prohibited in fact we were woken up by the police who kindly told us to go away
23265,1886252,4,akilaclau,13/05/2022,"Nice parking next to the beach, near a small area of pine trees, in summer it is an area of beach bars. From Santa Susanna it can no longer be accessed since a storm washed away the road. It is only accessible from Pineda passing the 1.90 high tunnel."
23265,1700796,3,FamiliaGaLo,30/11/2021,"If you can access it, it is a privileged place. Tranquility, beach and a spectacular sunrise. It is located between two towns, Pineda de Mar and Santa Susanna. By Pineda a subway with dimensions of 1.9 high by 2.2 wide. Only suitable for vans. Accessing by Santa Susanna better for motorhome. No services. Overnight is allowed."
23265,1191139,1,tirneta,10/05/2021,"The place is pretty. I go in minifurgo and I suffered to enter. Very narrow track underpass. 1.9m high by 2.2m wide. and above the road cannot be accessed. If there is another entry that can be reached, I did not find it. I went one afternoon in May and it was quite busy, I understand that in summer more."
23265,1147478,3,NinusBune,06/03/2021,A quiet place yet clearance height of 1.90m and 2.2m wide to cross the underpass. We couldn't get in with our van.
23265,824123,1,mamon13,14/06/2020,It is not allowed to sleep there. Local police invited us to look for another place.
23265,647880,4,casta40,21/08/2019,"Top parking, sea view, beach showers quite quiet except near train but worse! Only flat public toilets are closed in the morning ..."
23265,632129,4,SPIZA,15/08/2019,"Descampadodo de arena in front of the beach, some night fishermen and fellow nudists mañaros. To enter through the underpass of the stream the height is 1'90. We did not dare and passed on the tracks and crossed a semi-pedestrian path to the parking lot. Very quiet night"
23265,618163,3,jonpaq,11/08/2019,"They have limited height to 2.20, for ac and large volume impossible. the site is perfect with beach shower and beach bar at 20m"
23265,530276,4,Pataka,27/06/2019,"The location is very good. At the beach, there was a chemical bath and there are showers on the beach. The only downside is that the train passes right behind. There is a lot of people walking along the promenade and at night some fisherman, but it is a very quiet place."
23265,454760,4,ticanard59,14/04/2019,"Beautiful beach without service in low season. Free, sea view, limited attention to 2.20 m"
23265,283790,2,RobertoSlater,08/07/2018,Bad attendance and party in summer. Railway passing by. Without particular charm .. can be in low season? ...
23265,277105,3,Without_nickname,29/06/2018,"When we arrived at the ""good"" area next to the sailing club it was occupied by tents, so we had to sleep very close to the road, with a lot of people going from 6:30 am to 12:00 pm. The police spend a lot but say nothing."
23265,246828,4,magalilian,05/05/2018,"Large quiet car park out of season, shower on the beach, we stayed for two nights, not bothered by the passing of the train, take, access at the end of the road * 2.50m high. We did not try the first, it seemed really low."
23265,162295,4,DragonetaBCN,31/07/2017,"Zone with several kilometers of beach not crowded and with many parking spaces. The best place to spend the night is the parking lot next to the sailing club, because you sleep right in front of the sea and further away from the train tracks. The only thing is that with the coordinates that appear here it was a bit difficult to find it because it took us to a point on the other side of the tracks."
23265,145702,4,ValouLou,25/06/2017,"The road to go to indicate a prohibition of parking / camper but at the end of the large parking without a sign, which borders the beach with a view of the sea. Very quiet at this time, some other vans. Shower on the beach. We stayed there and had lunch, perfect!"
23265,141791,5,bubleblu,09/06/2017,"Beach without people, without cars, on foot of sand and sea. right on a nudist beach. super quiet Perfect to spend a night. With beach shower running properly with drinking water. beautiful!"
23265,140568,4,valeriane,04/06/2017,Very nice place.
23265,113607,5,SoNemo,06/11/2016,Awesome ! Life is splendid and we are visibly quiet!
23265,68395,4,timeot5,12/04/2016,"Quiet place, nice. Despite the railroad but non-regular train and not disturbing at night. Showers on the beach did not work by the time we passed."
23294,1254603,1,claudioedany,14/06/2021,"Camping expensive for the service that you get. Very noisy, a lot of people, not clean,..... If you want to be in down town ok.
The only good thing: very close to the beach (that you don't see!!! Because the van are putted on the back of the area next to the traffic road)"
23294,673369,3,barrigijon,02/09/2019,"The plot where we were with a 7-20, attached to the road, was well sized. bungalow oriented, but good services. direct access to the beach. Expensive to go by car caravan. 30 minutes walk to La Pobla, highly recommended, but the road is dangerous. Better to get around by taxi."
23342,3168074,4,LizaLamas,17/08/2023,"In the middle of the estuary, next to a small beach on one side, in the middle of the sea and a small port with traditional boats on the other side. In the middle a small picnic area with water taps. We stayed for one night, we parked on the beach side because the sea side was full and we ate dinner at sunset... In the morning we were surrounded by cars for the beach, the port side is better."
23342,3095143,5,jldias58,07/08/2023,Very nice quiet place with all the stuff said..
23342,3024681,4,jmartland,26/07/2023,"Stayed for one night, lots of rubbish bins, water taps and public toilets open during the day time. A little noisy at night with cars coming and going. A few other campers there. Great sunset spot!"
23342,2810741,3,flower11,01/06/2023,"It is theoretically a very nice and quiet place right on the water. There is a sandy beach, enough parking spaces and benches, rubbish bins, walks with the dog through nature. But it's super noisy as there are always cars and motorbikes just driving around late into the night making noise!! I was also unlucky with my camping neighbors who argued loudly all night!"
23342,2726926,5,anjocores,06/05/2023,"Paradise location. Regrettable 1 French campervan with huge trailer and Smart occupying 4 places and filling 4 bottles of water paid for by the locals, to book another space to reserve for a friend. Sad."

23342,2492702,5,mathelsmit,12/11/2022,"Beautiful place on the water. Lots of mosquitoes so bring deet with you. There is a small water tap (no drinking water). There are no showers or other facilities, you can pee at the snack bar, but it is not necessarily intended for that."
23342,2439888,5,Xavierarnoux,12/10/2022,an extra corner. a very nice snack cafe. very quiet and beautiful place. many locations where one can park for the night. a few motorhomes present for this evening (10) thank you to the municipality for accepting our presence.
23342,2223573,4,Fuzikipt,12/08/2022,Beautiful place with plenty of parking space. River beach next door with restrooms and lifeguard. The locals frequent a lot both during the day and at night. The space has several snack tables and also a restaurant.
23342,2221037,4,mscatarinajorge,12/08/2022,we spend 1 night here. a bit noisy because the locals come to gather here during the night. but it's a beautiful place with nice views.
23342,2203335,5,ketins,09/08/2022,"We have spent the night here and very well. There are several car parks to park, so no one has bothered us. Very quiet place. The bathrooms close at night, but they open and clean them first thing in the morning There is a picnic area and views of the lagoon"
23342,2146649,4,zalatany,30/07/2022,Very nice place but busy.
23342,2143677,5,MattCC,30/07/2022,Nice quiet place and which in addition has two restaurants as good as the other although different. I think it's one of the most relaxing places we've been. We went there 5 years ago and we went back recently... still as authentic!
23342,1904560,2,Jdcruz,21/05/2022,Already was better. A very popular place now. Noisy. Constant coming and going of motorcycles and cars. During the night come the accelerators and loud music... Two stars just for the landscape. There are many other places around the ria where you can stay peacefully and with the same views.
23342,1849103,5,raskatran,23/04/2022,"great place, you can spend the night"

23342,1737153,5,MissSchwertfisch,19/01/2022,"Dream place. If only it weren't for the locals ;-) I now know what they do: they go for a walk. The aim is to head for a wonderful vantage point at the highest possible speed, to turn immediately in breakneck maneuvers and to make an equally rapid descent over the preferably loud, booming cobblestones. Under no circumstances should the car be left. Stopping and enjoying the view is against the rules. But getting out of the car: unthinkable... only we cultureless campers rub our eyes in amazement and simply don't see the beauty of the walking lawn."
23342,1674768,5,KG35,02/11/2021,"Arrived at 2 am, 3 other campers on site. Very calm place. Water available, beach 50 meters away and view of the small port."

23342,489356,5,Falkor,21/05/2019,"Great place! Many places, sorting bins, WC, beach (muddy at low tide, I think), restaurant, picnic tables ... Around, fields, with very pleasant bike paths to discover small picturesque harbors. As everywhere, some cars spend the night and the paving stones are noisy, but it's quickly forgotten. The city provides free wifi! Thank you for everything !"
23342,477403,4,brujo76,06/05/2019,"Very nice environment, with many possibilities to park. Despite being there on a Saturday night, we were not bothered by the snack bar which closed late."
23342,279291,4,4141,02/07/2018,"Very good. Time not top. Only 4 motorhomes. Closed restaurant (Monday). Snack bar nice, but closed at 19h. All previous positive comments are justified! View, space, ... To recommend (without excess)"

23342,209857,5,papy_marcel,06/11/2017,"We stayed here for one night, 5 years ago at the same time and we were the only motorhome. This morning, there are more than 20, it must be said that the area is really great and quiet, hope that a ban on parking for motorhomes will not bloom a day!"
23342,194400,3,pascale17,16/09/2017,"Two quiet nights facing the sea, very friendly corner, no damage service area, just possibility of water. A super bike route"

23342,119155,5,brunad,01/02/2017,"Very quiet place. Nice landscape, on the other hand attention, arriving from the south, the access road in the village is under construction so clay and ruts on 2 km but it rolls."
23342,116777,4,maeletcaro,27/12/2016,"Peaceful place, beautiful view, very quiet night, very nice coffee staff and we were able to recharge our computers."

23342,115827,4,Tornjak,10/12/2016,"2016.12.10 - Very good location on a paved area facing the lagoon. Water tap available, small restaurant / bar with wifi 200 meters from the parking."
23342,115364,5,wil21,04/12/2016,"Very good spot, we spent 3 nights really quiet. Small snack bar around the corner with friendly staff and smiling, a pity that there is no service because really nice."

23342,76105,4,aureline,09/06/2016,"Very nice place, flat, the port in the lagoon, to advise"
23343,2743650,4,hayleystevens,12/05/2023,"didn't overnight, great for grey waste and water, screw tap is at ground level, black waste appears to be the grid between the tap and grey waste, functional but hose it down lots to avoid leaving debris behind and leave it pleasant for the next user :-)"
23343,2597759,2,WombatM,04/03/2023,"2 stars for the good V/E. The second tap for fresh water works. We found the place only partially suitable for overnight stays. At 8:00 p.m., the village youth raised their voices by shouting ruthlessly. At half past nine, a couple of musicians playing timpani and drums practiced for 20 minutes a few meters away at the entrance to the swimming pool, we almost fell out of bed. Overnight Friday."
23343,2589040,5,AlexandraePippo,24/02/2023,"great place to fill water, little pressure but one of the best waters in Spain"
23343,2571118,4,Albmi,07/02/2023,"an area with services easy to access clean nice view of the castle next to the swimming pool and tennis courts. Quiet night, very well lit, perfect for visiting and taking a walk to the castle. Thanks to the municipality"
23343,2566410,5,Kutter2,02/02/2023,Clean place with exemplary installation. Many permanent campers.
23343,2555356,5,aabuelo,19/01/2023,"Thanks to the town hall for the area. There is a container at the exit, next to the indoor pool, but it is difficult to find it. Important historical heritage and hiking trails. Do not miss the ""El Cigarralejo"" museum, the largest collection of Iberian art in Spain, in front of the food market where you can buy exquisite Murcian sausages. Excursion to Fuente Caputa and route of time"
23343,2547256,5,Ch.St.07.05,09/01/2023,"Clean, quiet!! free, solid ground, safe, nice view of the castle and the town. We recommend"
23343,2529353,1,Nico4298,27/12/2022,"Huge disappointment... The village is pretty, the services are free. However, IMPOSSIBLE to sleep. All night this spot becomes the meeting place for young people. Lots and lots of motorbikes, noisy scooters. They have no consideration for the CCs stationed here. At 2am, unable to hold on any longer, we went to sleep at the Cierza dam in search of calm."
23343,2524609,5,SyFri,19/12/2022,"Thanks to the community, clean, quiet, small place."
23343,2520812,5,aussteiger1993,13/12/2022,"Great, heated indoor pool 26 degrees from 9am to 12pm or 5pm to 10pm with bathing cap. Very friendly residents. Had a quiet night. Thanks to the city."
23343,2520761,5,Dieter61,13/12/2022,Clean and quiet at night. Thanks to the community for the place
23343,2519471,3,swifteurope,11/12/2022,"its ok. thanks to city for providing. farly flat. indoor swimming pool. 

a few issues... kids gather to talk in evening... ok when we where there but potential noise problem as some of the kids have motorcycles

very low flow water tap and shared with wc as other tap not functional. this needs fixing."
23343,2517274,4,CSP06,09/12/2022,Good area near climbing sectors. The only drawback is that no pressure comes out and it takes a long time to fill the tank.
23343,2494134,1,AnaM8,13/11/2022,"Stop to fill and empty. The correct emptying, but the water barely has pressure and it has been impossible to fill the tank"
23343,1966741,4,RodantPelMon,11/06/2022,"correct area, but we didn't let them go, it's not clear the places for the ACs, at night young people came to give the talk, about 1 o'clock they withdrew."
23343,1936595,4,Navajas,01/06/2022,"Ares very clean, flat, paved and illuminated at night, very quiet, the filling and emptying services work perfectly. Congratulations to the City Council, for such a magnificent area, it is a pity that it does not have shade"
23343,1890084,5,hasenteufel,14/05/2022,Thank you to the community. Everything OK. Great to drive the Via Verde in both directions and an indoor pool 20m away. felt very safe. Very quiet place. View of mountains and castle.
23343,1887393,4,PacoGR53,13/05/2022,"We stayed two days, shared area with cars, very clean and lit at night, no shade, very quiet, filling and emptying services work perfectly, I recommend going up to Los Vélez castle, magnificent views."
23343,1862537,4,mariacolin,30/04/2022,A nice town to visit. It is a shame that the castle is closed.  Still a good view from the top.  Stayed two nights.  Very quiet both nights.  Early evening sports complex and pool busy.  Only 4 stars as water flow  is very slow and  WC rinsing tap is not clearly marked.   Thanks to community for providing this area
23343,1831379,2,jlpc,17/04/2022,"It is difficult to signal the faucets worse. There is a post with a front exit that they use for the WC until they discover that behind it there is a tap with a thread that should be for drinking and that puts the WC by hand. It is not logical that the threaded one is for the WC and the one that does not have it is for clean water. Looking, you discover a chest on the ground with a tap with a low but acceptable flow. It costs little to signal well."
23343,1817095,5,Quesito,12/04/2022,We have spent the night there and very well. We were 8 AC. Very quiet area and very close to visit the town. It has emptying of gray water and WC. Thanks to the town hall for facilitating tourism with a motorhome.
23343,1785722,5,PacoFernandez,17/03/2022,"Good area to visit the town of Mula and make routes through the surroundings. Now we have a Heated Pool on site, a real luxury, €4 individual ticket, to exercise and get back in shape."
23343,1776622,3,FranciscoPalomares,07/03/2022,"As they say, the sewage drain is on the ground, you have to lift the cover, and the filling tap is not the one you see, but it is under a cover on the side, it is raised and connected there, I did not spend the night, so I can't comment on that"
23343,1760167,1,Iogi66,19/02/2022,"Municipal area which has the merit of existing in this area with infrequent authorized parking. Free services: water, cassette emptying and gray water. Asphalt ground, slightly sloping. Black point: meeting place for young people on scooters at different times of the day."
23343,1759593,1,Tornjak,18/02/2022,"Parking/area accessible to all sizes, on asphalt, low level and without shade. In the evening, the young motorized vehicles of the village are very noisy. They gather here without any discretion but rather with a provocative objective. Archaic but free services. Optimal satellite and 4G reception."
23343,1748407,3,emmamarie,05/02/2022,"feels safe as there are several campers here, nothing special with the parking. But good to drain gray water and refill. walking distance to the center, super cozy in the old town here. wifi did not work for me. is satisfied"
23343,1740567,5,Trampermobil,24/01/2022,Nice start to the castle. Laundromat with new - Miele professional - washing machines !! 800m away. Mercadona and Aldi in town.
23343,1736129,4,DougPirahna,17/01/2022,"Free WIFI.  Very spacious.  Do not park behind the swimming pool as the local youths use it for meeting up (between parked motorhomes), drinking, dropping litter and being a nuisance.  Parking in front of the tennis courts seems better."
23343,1719527,5,julsssgde,30/12/2021,"Very nice place to spend the night or just visit the town. We slept without problem and quite calm, without noise. Near the center. It is true about the water (you have to lift the cover next to the tap and connect there) and the sewage also under a cover on the ground where the motorhome is placed (if you stand on it, you do not see it). The very pretty town."
23343,1716810,3,Filipeascensao,27/12/2021,"Water has a trick... Take the cover near the fountain and connect to put water, unless you have time...."
23343,1704506,5,Milyunarutas,06/12/2021,We have spent a very quiet night surrounded by 8-10 campers / motorhomes. It is a 10 minute walk from the town center. Water filling and gray and BLACK emptying next to sports areas totally free. Great views of the castle. Thanks to the Mula city council for this initiative.
23343,1702518,5,Elze,03/12/2021,"Mula is shunned by the negative reviews. There are no campers on the square. Well young people. We and a French camper are in the parking lot next door. Upside-down world..... craziness. Water for the camper can be found to the left of the water column, under the lid. Together with a number of Spaniards, we have been at the motorhome since December 4. No nuisance so far from youth. Keep it like that !!!"
23343,1699743,1,javolo65,28/11/2021,"We arrived at 19 hours. No one was parked. I go down to check the place and the drainage area. The taps without pressure… Young people begin to appear on noisy mopeds. The races and the spins begin. We decided to go to Ceutí ... it's a shame, Mula will be very beautiful but it seems that there are those who do not want us to know."
23343,1685634,1,Carisma,11/11/2021,A place with a lot of noise. driving mopeds to loud music. only the emptying that is good for a car with a fixed rating.
23343,1682721,1,Sacamantecas,08/11/2021,"Ample parking next to the pool, has to load water and empty gray, but there is no box to empty sewage. The worst thing about this place is that every night all the teenagers from the town gather to bother throughout the night, it is impossible to sleep because of screaming, night fights, motorcycles racing until dawn. I don't come back here even if they pay me money."
23343,1655929,4,adamto,21/10/2021,"Large parking next to swimming pool. very noisy at night, lots of people playing music. there is working water tap and gray water hole"
23343,1651707,2,Africafan,18/10/2021,"We only disposed of here, it works so far. Water withdrawal is very time-consuming, we did without it."
23343,1648628,4,reisssi,17/10/2021,"The square can be reached via the ""Av de la Paz"", coming from the northeast. The ""piscina municipal"" could serve as a destination on Google Maps. We just deflated. That worked without any problems. The place is paved and relatively flat. Lots of empty bottles and plastic waste suggest another use."
23343,1602039,1,amoedo89,23/09/2021,"Fenced site, area is not accessible"
23343,1590686,1,cortinass,19/09/2021,"The area very well, I already knew it. The town is very beautiful, yesterday we even took a guided tour, but apart from the fact that, as you already know, the young people are going to make a bottle, tonight there was a macro bottle as the parties were. At 3:30 in the morning, 3 patrols advised us to leave there because of what might happen. Hundreds of young people drinking, without masks and without control, crowded together. Etc"
23343,1551472,1,EGCASTRO,05/09/2021,"Today Sunday there are more youth here on motorcycles and cars than in a Disco, to be calm nothing at all!"
23343,1395907,4,mtalhao,02/08/2021,"Although I don't sleep here, the space is very flat and shady."
23343,1307286,4,isogamu,09/07/2021,"This is the second night we have spent here. It can be a bit noisy because it is true that the young people of the village come here to meet, but they do not stay until very late and it also depends on the day. The taps have low pressure, we have filled a bucket of water and we have removed the water with a pump. Gray water can be drained. Gas station very close. Views of the castle."
23343,1238955,4,mjtaylor66,06/06/2021,"Nice site and location, feels a little isolated if on your own but that said was all ok, drainage and water , albeit the water is slow but then again it’s free what more do you want"
23343,1181958,4,brachychitum,29/04/2021,"The area is very well conditioned. It is close to the town and has very nice views of the castle. The only bad thing is that it is a bottle place; But since there is a curfew, the young people have to leave early and the nights are very quiet. When the curfew is lifted, I'm afraid this will change."
23343,1181609,3,travelbus,29/04/2021,"Thanks to the city for this free parking space. Water runs, but slowly. Floodlights all night. Otherwise quiet. We slept very well."
23343,1178281,4,nofrills,23/04/2021,"Super parking space on site! Supply and disposal free of charge. In the evening a meeting place for young people, therefore a bit noisy."
23343,1160915,5,Osegui,30/03/2021,A nice and perfect place to visit the beautiful city of Mula
23343,1156072,4,agulinaress,23/03/2021,"Very close to the town and with beautiful views of the castle, the only negative is that there is very little water flow, a thread comes out of the tap"
23343,1154130,4,Jean36240,20/03/2021,Very nice view of the castle located on the hill opposite Quiet and restful place drainage and free water attention low flow
23343,1139947,4,cortinass,21/02/2021,We have returned and this time we have slept 2 nights accompanied by other foreign cars. The good thing now is that people who come to drink bottles with a curfew at 10 pm have to be at home. The old town is beautiful
23343,1132046,4,roosa,21/01/2021,"We recommend it !
 coronasafe when we were all alone on this lovely place. quit in the night (you may not go out after 22 ) 
 the whater comes very very slowly but you will get what you need. Good for big motorhomes too!
Aldi 2 km and mercadona in town.
Many thanks to the community!

team LMC"

23343,1124622,3,cortinass,28/12/2020,Very good area but we did not stay to sleep because of the amount of negative comments. We seek more security in the urban nucleus
23343,1121060,1,GladiatoR83,13/12/2020,Too isolated. There were no other ACs and we went somewhere else near houses.

Happy we stayed a few nights, thanks to the municipality."
23343,433459,2,lysmicb,25/02/2019,Thank you to the municipality of Mula for this area. It is unfortunate that cars make incessant roundtrips. Young people drive fast enough to the area and speak loudly.
23343,421277,3,romanber,08/01/2019,"We spent one night there, specifically on January 6th. We were 4 caravans for the night. At night several cars came to make a bottle, although the truth is that they did not bother much. There is a drainage area and water load, but no point of electricity. In the next area there are no bars or anything, the closest to about 15/20 minutes walk. The parking was also that of a municipal swimming pool that had all the signs of being closed for some time."
23343,410692,4,Tanya,28/11/2018,"Great place to stop for a cycle along the Via Verde. This is signed on the main road. Look for the purple and yellow signs. If you turn right from the swimming pool, it’s a beautiful ride to Bullas, especially once you pass Niño de Mula."

The place is safe because it is well guarded with cameras and guards on the weekend. It's also cheap.

However we stayed on a Saturday night and there was at least three night clubs adjacent to the car park which were blasting out loud music all night until 07.00. On top of this the container port behind us was moving and transporting lorries and containers into the early hours. It cost just under 9 euros to stay. No facilities.
23434,2726531,1,lorienadv,06/05/2023,"Said they’d take an XL vehicle.Ok to pay for double space.Next day given 15min to leave.Didn’t let us park along the wall out of the way.Asked for cash & charged a ‘bus tariff’. When asked why we couldn’t stay when he had a tariff for XL vehicles he changed his mind and said we could stay..Left,do not recommend this place due to the way they behaved. Entrance tight, loud music,didn’t bother us."
23434,2683166,4,Romy1306,20/04/2023,"Parking in town for €8.05 for 24 hours!!!! Nothing better to visit Cadiz, enjoy tapas and vino tinto!!! Of course there is noise at night with the music but you have to remember that we were young too!!!"
23434,2648832,1,Iwil,08/04/2023,The parking lot is near the city center. On the other hand there is a huge open-air nightclub less than 100m away. Can you imagine the noise!!!!! And the port cranes load the cargo ships for half the night.
23434,2643673,4,PAETNERTEPEE2015,06/04/2023,"Perfect RV site, bottom left as you walk in. They look more AC. The entrance is fucked up, his thing is to enter the street facing the entrance with his ass and from there you enter straight."
23434,2637582,4,sgllobre,03/04/2023,"we have parked to see cadiz, good location safe and cheap. A good start from there to the entire promenade that surrounds Cádiz to reach the castle and La Caleta beach. eat good and cheap tapas in the minibar in the center of Cádiz"
23434,2634489,1,josemleon2,01/04/2023,"Never, I repeat, never sleep here on a Friday or Saturday night. The disco that is next door and the bottle organized by the young people at the door are a hell of music and shouting until 3 or 4 in the morning. And then the drunks at 7 am. The worst night I remember."
23434,2619265,3,Arcolobalenos,22/03/2023,"Port parking, we parked just to go around the city and then left. Dirty and noisy. Convenient to the city."
23434,2617867,4,FamilieSchlenkerbein,20/03/2023,Parked the campervan here for a daytime visit to Cadiz Old Town. Good price for a secure car park so close to downtown.
23434,2593506,4,AnkeRolf,28/02/2023,"There are not many alternatives in Cadiz. It's not nice here, sea containers are loaded directly at the parking lot, trucks rumble past the site 24 hours a day. But it is guarded, there is a toilet and you can quickly walk to the old town, which is well worth seeing. We would stay here again if there was no offer to visit Cadiz."
23434,2593434,4,lupe1989,27/02/2023,"2 nights in the middle of the Cádiz carnival, 10 minutes from the center on foot. €18 for 24 hours. There were services at the entrance and rubbish bins at the door. To gain access, you would have to open a bit since the entrance is somewhat narrow. 6m without a problem"
23434,2589185,2,AndreasHa,24/02/2023,"The friendly groundskeeper allowed himself to be persuaded to allocate me a spot, despite being fully occupied. But there was a can of fine Bavarian beer. The location is very good. However, the disco next door (Friday night) is extremely loud!!"
23434,2573403,1,RensvanLoon,10/02/2023,"Good parking place to visit the city. However, DO NOT stay here unless you don't want to sleep. All night noise from the Containers and Disco. Better move to 36.53064, -6.304885 (lat, lng) on the other side of town"
23434,2570508,1,pierreafeu84,06/02/2023,"this car park inaccessible from the right for long CCs, perhaps having made a U-turn. but there is a nicer car park for 3.60 € for 3 hours"
23434,2554534,4,mikef501,18/01/2023,"Regarding comments that right turn into car park is very tight, if you drive passed the entrance there are two roundabouts (1st small, 2nd large) where you can turn around and approach the car park as a left turn with plenty of room. Also we had a good nights sleep, felt very safe, with no disco noise and wind noise drowned out noise of container movement. Perfect for walking into city centre."
23434,2543984,3,VanessaAlvarado,06/01/2023,Very friendly and helpful staff. On January 5th it cost us €18/24 hours. A walk from the center. 24 hour surveillance. Very busy night. Too noisy to be able to rest.
23434,2543048,3,Sandalias,05/01/2023,"Parking very expensive. €1.80 per hour up to a maximum of €18 per 24h. Entrance with a 90 degree turn from the street that gives access, it is not a problem because there is room to maneuver and street with little traffic. Our AC is 7.5 meters. 10 minutes from the historic center of Cádiz. Not recommended for sleeping, a lot of hustle and bustle from the port. We went to sleep in an area in Jerez, about 30 minutes"
23434,2532186,2,PonichiAC,29/12/2022,"5* Parking PERFECT to visit Cádiz DURING THE DAY, however, I recommend NOT STAYING OVERNIGHT 1*. It is a parking lot in front of discos that open every day from 11-6am and when their music ends, the noise from the containers begins. At Christmas €18/24h. The staff very friendly and attentive."
23434,2531703,2,josant1976,28/12/2022,"Good parking and central. At Christmas, Easter and Carnival the parking fee is abusive. In our case, 48 hours have cost us 36 euros. Constant noise of trucks and banging containers. Level and concrete parking. The motorhome area is in the background on the left. The staff is attentive and helpful."
23434,2530530,3,clarita,28/12/2022,"€18 for 24 hours at Christmas, Carnival and Easter. Noisy as hell, the containers, the trucks, the disco open on a Tuesday, the only good thing about it is that it is one of the best options for visiting the old town. or to take the boat and go to Rota"
23434,2530130,3,rvanvugt,27/12/2022,"Suitable as day parking as it is spacious and quite close to the old town of Cádiz. but, due to the high noise level of the harbour with all its movements of trucks and containers, I did not stay overnight here. Tricky tight entrance but manageable. Clean and safe, toilets at entrance."
23434,2520108,4,SarahT2,12/12/2022,"4 stars due to location which is very convenient for visiting the old town. The nightclub was loud until 6am and the trucks moving shipping containers around, but if you want to see Cadiz on the cheap buy some earplugs and put up with the noise, or join them! We spent 1 night here and 1 at the Castillo car park at €28 per night but nicer location and right by the sea. Cadiz is absolutely beautiful"
23434,2514942,1,david25fps,07/12/2022,Parking near the center. cheap... paying in person costs €3 per day. That price is only for motorhomes. Campers and adapted vehicles pay like cars. We spent two nights. because you have to be willing to put up with the noise from the counters and the discotheques across the street.
23434,2512198,1,PaulavanS,04/12/2022,"staying overnight is not recommended, we were here Saturday afternoon and fled the noise in the night. trucks rumble past during the day and in the evening and at 4 o'clock at night we left, what bad music too. only had to tap 8.05 that was not too bad. it is a great place to visit Cadiz that is all"
23434,2508221,4,kaj220,28/11/2022,Parked for the day. 6€ for about 7 hours. Friendly attendants.
23434,2503909,5,FeeeNdr,23/11/2022,"This is the second time we have returned to visit Cadiz. Ideal location near the city center, this time we did not sleep there because it lacks a bit of charm and the parking lot is quite noisy. We spent 6 hours there to visit the city and paid around €6.80. It is an excellent option to leave your vehicle safe. Cash payment only!"
23434,2496681,4,AnnieMoon,15/11/2022,"The car park is good for visiting the city as it is central and at a good price. But it is not understood that they make a difference in price between a motorhome and a Camper, so it took away a star. We slept there since we had dinner with friends and we came back late and no longer felt like moving. It was Saturday and the disco was open but being November there were few people and noise was not a problem for us."
23434,2495147,3,budgie1963,14/11/2022,"apparently by Google the nightclub is closed Sun-Wed don't know if this is really the case, but we were here on  Sunday and yes nightclub was closed, but was still a very noisy night with trucks and a container crane going all night, earplugs needed unless you have had about 12 pints, would advise parking over the right if night club open, and over to the left away from the crane if it is closed"
23434,2490198,1,clc1989,10/11/2022,An environmental disaster. Constant noise and disco right there. We left the parking lot without sleeping in it.
23434,2489750,1,elinecl,10/11/2022,"Impossible to sleep at night because of the noise from the discotheques, the worst thing was that the music was even really bad :) This was on a Wednesday night, 0am to 6am. Park on the far right when you enter the parking lot. Ideal base for exploring Cadiz, 5 minutes on foot to the center. Price for campervan = 8.5 euros/24h"
23434,2477365,3,globebus29,01/11/2022,"Ideal price near the historic center but avoid the weekend because of the proximity of the discotheque, park at the bottom on the right when returning"
23434,2459117,4,monicapark,23/10/2022,"Very convenient and cheap parking for visiting the city! Attention at the entrance, turn right very tight but with a little maneuvering it can be done .. we have a vehicle of 6.20 meters"
23434,2454510,2,Telemaco,21/10/2022,"Impossible to sleep. The bars in front have been with music and people until 05:30 in the morning. And so Thursday night, and Friday, and Saturday."
23434,2446387,3,CarroCasa,16/10/2022,"good park close to the center, cheap but without services, two nights, one calm just the normal noise of the port another very noisy with hundreds of young people in the clubs, if you park farther from the clubs you can avoid more noise, several acs overnight"
23434,2400586,5,Hasen,24/09/2022,Really great to look at Cadiz. We didn't stay overnight but that was due to our baby we have with us. Otherwise we would have stopped there!!!
23434,2313011,1,KaliforniaGorri,28/08/2022,We went looking for a place and we were thrown in a bad way.
23434,2282229,4,angelutxo,21/08/2022,"To spend the day, great for 3.10 for motorhomes, paying cash at the entrance. Central to visit the city. At night, a lot of noise from the disco, music in the street, talked to municipal officials and they have permission. They advise that we sleep in Cortadura, It must be right next to the beach, with showers from the beach, and as we have been told, it is fine."
23434,2195735,1,hernani76,08/08/2022,"Parking well located but to flee for the night as said before except to put earplugs. There is not 1 (which I thought was closed on Sundays) but 2 nightclubs located at the bottom left of the car park. For the prices, it is obvious that the counter clerk puts 50% of the sum in his pocket since in his office (closed on Sundays but can be adjusted on Monday mornings) the validated ticket indicates 3.10e… and not 6.30e as required. I pointed it out to him but unable to give a coherent explanation."
23434,2191144,1,Hector1975,07/08/2022,"AN UNBEARABLE NIGHT!! Let's see, what's at the door is not a disco, it's a verbena in the very street. It is a parking lot, we agree, but if overnight stays are allowed, it would be appreciated if the person at the door at least informs you that something similar to the Cádiz carnival is celebrated there every night from 11:30 p.m. 6:30 IN THE STREET!!!"
23434,2191061,1,jmvarmar,07/08/2022,It makes no sense to make a special rate of 3 euros for motorhomes but exclude Camper. Someone explain it to me
23434,2185296,3,lods93,06/08/2022,"Very central and great for visiting the city. €8.05 per night is also fine. The music in the disco opposite was very loud until 6:30am. Around 8:00 a.m. it was very loud at the container port behind the parking lot. Class to visit the city, but unfortunately not suitable for sleeping."
23434,2179142,1,Rodrigo77,05/08/2022,"They have not let me in as there is more than enough space for the AC. He just hasn't left me because the ""gentleman"" hasn't felt like it."
23434,2172765,2,aran88,04/08/2022,"Ideal to visit the city, but to enjoy as we have done, I do not recommend it, a disco next door, music and people until 6 in the morning, the price is great €6 24 hours but I would choose it only to visit the city given its Location"
23434,2159053,3,VictorC8P,01/08/2022,"Good place if you are interested in spending the night in the city of Cadiz! On weekends quite noisy because of the disco in front! Good price, one day €6-7! It does not have any type of service for AC! Just park and go!"
23434,2103078,3,masaragon,21/07/2022,"Ideal for those of us who have to board the Ferry to the Canary Islands, it can be a bit noisy, but guarded for the special motorhome rate, you have to pay the staff at the entrance and if you have to leave at times that are not better, notify and pay before"

23434,2013253,3,GeoDalmis,26/06/2022,"Good and safe parking to visit Cádiz. You are quickly in the center. We can't judge at night, we only stayed 5 hours. Parking fees unfortunately not as stated. The machine charged us 5.35 euros instead of 3.10 euros (panel van 5.40 m). The ticket booth was not manned (Mon-Fri 9am-6pm; Sat/Sun 9am-2pm), so we had no choice but to complain about the price."
23434,1998176,4,nico.claire,21/06/2022,"Good for visiting the city, guarded and not very expensive. The special 24-hour CC rate only applies to CCs and not to vans… Toilets during ticket office opening hours."
23434,1983690,5,kelianR,16/06/2022,"Perfect to visit Cadiz in one day, to sleep I don't see it so clearly anymore... Puerto nightclubs etc would have been better places for sure... Paying at the sentry box and you let us know that you are a motorhome, better price! Thanks a lot"
23434,1955289,1,RBNLPA,07/06/2022,"Very noisy parking, in front of a nightclub that starts at 1am and ends at dawn, noise from the dock (containers). VERY IMPORTANT, at carnivals the day costs €18, which just so happens that this year it is in June, I will not repeat it again since the price seems abusive to me, I have gone to see Cádiz not the carnivals. I will not repeat or recommend it."
23434,1932912,3,Toja22,30/05/2022,"5stars for visiting Cadiz. 1 for sleeping as there's a disco pub just opposite that plays music until 6.30AM! And thousand of teens screaming, at least on Saturday.
However, it's at few steps from the centre,flat and cheap as we only payed 6.20€ for 24H (but you need to pay at the person who works there,not at the machine).
And a minivan pays only 3.10€!"
23434,1928808,3,mariapa4182,29/05/2022,"It is an ideal place to visit the old town of Cádiz. It has no services, other than parking, when the maintenance staff is there the bathrooms are open, if they are not there, no. To sleep, considering that it is right next to the port cranes and the young people's party area, at least during the weekends it is very noisy."
23434,1889175,3,LinaScherz,14/05/2022,"The location of the square is good for visiting the old town. The place is monitored and the price can't be beat. Unfortunately, the toilet was super dirty and the night was very restless, as containers are loaded in the port all night."
23434,1886278,3,clenali,13/05/2022,"an ideal location for visiting the city on foot or by bike. Strongly not recommended for sleeping, loud noise from loading and unloading of containers. From Thursday evening nightclubs next door until 7am!!"
23434,1884384,3,FeeeNdr,11/05/2022,"The price is €3.10 for 24 hours for vehicles that only occupy 1 space (-5m40). For vehicles that occupy more than one space, the price is doubled, i.e. €6.20 for 24 hours. If you put your ticket in the machine, the displayed price will not be correct and will show 8.60€. You have to go see the person at the reception, give the length of his camper and he will make you pay the correct price."
23434,1881936,3,PhoenixCologne,10/05/2022,"Anything but a nice parking lot, but it is very centrally located and ideal for visiting Cadiz. Toilets take a lot of getting used to. Otherwise no infrastructure. Very noisy in the morning due to the port operations. But the price is okay."

23434,1854584,4,LuisFernandoJimenez,26/04/2022,"Not bad, at least there is a place in a city where we can park our ACs. Indicate €6 and I was charged €8.01. I didn't protest either. By the way, I thought I was going to have trouble sleeping because I was close to the port (because of the containers) but I had it more because of the strong wind that shook us all throughout the night."
23434,1851162,3,KikoSuarez,24/04/2022,"It is a guarded car park in the port of Cadiz. The good thing about it is that you are very close to the center and the day costs for motorhomes of less than 6m €3.1 (if not €6.2). The bad thing is that being in the port there is a lot of noise when unloading the ships in the morning. The car park next to the castle is much quieter, but it costs €14."
23434,1848624,3,elchio,23/04/2022,"Great for visiting Cadiz, 10 minutes walk. Arbitrary price: we had to drive out again after half an hour to go to the workshop and paid €3.10. The car park attendant said we would have to pay the same tomorrow, but the machine said €8.30?! The disco is also in full swing on Friday nights, very loud until 7am."

23434,1820662,3,alexben350,14/04/2022,All right. But they did not have a special rate for motorhomes during Easter. We paid €15 to park for about 6 hours (motorhome 7 m)
23434,1818534,4,OscaR7676,13/04/2022,"Quiet night, except for the noise of trucks loading containers. Easter, Christmas and Carnival, the rate is €18 for 24 hours. To enter, maneuver backwards towards the street in front of the barrier and you enter straight ahead. Ideal for visiting the center of Cadiz."

That with the not allowed vehicles, as it says in the description, is not true. We were there with a Sprinter conversion and there was a car with a roof tent in front of us."
23434,1792417,3,CharlieFisher12345,23/03/2022,"Enter, take ticket from machine, park up, then go pay at the ticket office directly and it’s 3.10 euros for 24h. You can hear the nightclub but if you park at the opposite end of the car park it isn’t too bad. Freight containers start being moved at 5am and are way noisier. Public toilets open by ticket office - open/locked at 9am/9pm, but staff toilet is open all night (white door on the right)."

WC services only during the day until 10 p.m. approx. Only inconvenience, noise of youth from some clubs next door and cargo ships. The children slept soundly, we were fine and if you are one of those who are fussy about noise, then some earplugs are a luxury."
23434,1766072,1,josant1976,26/02/2022,I arrived with the motorhome and the person at the ticket office told me that no more motorhomes were allowed when cars continued to enter. With a small baby and after hours I had to find out about life by driving half an hour to another place.
23434,1764369,3,Manzaneque10,24/02/2022,"Shared parking with other cars with 24-hour guard and very close to the center. Very cheap rate to be in the city center. The negative point is the noise at night. Disco music (on a Wednesday) quite loud, if not, it does its job"
23434,1763252,3,reisender06,22/02/2022,"Visually and in terms of volume, of course, not perfect. Therefor 10 min from the city center of Zentrum. Really good and inexpensive for a few days in Cadiz."
23434,1761873,4,BUnger,21/02/2022,definitely well located for visiting the city.
23434,1761655,3,pepepepone,21/02/2022,"A good place, to see Cadiz on foot you get to the center and with a theater next door and music you can get a ticket for 7 days 16 euros and you can come and go as many times as you need, it is the most economical, there is not even to empty nor filling, but near gas station for that, there is noise, but that does not bother me. Cadiz very nice city."
23434,1760528,2,dycikira,19/02/2022,Good parking... But be careful with the long ac… it doesn't give you the turn to enter because the fairway and the angle make it impossible…. You have to maneuver and stop traffic to face it on a cross street
23434,1755442,4,Pummelchen007,13/02/2022,We made the best of it and stayed at the club next door until 5am in the morning (which got most people excited about here). We rarely had such a short walk home ;) otherwise there are toilets and the price is okay - we paid €9.30 for a little over 24 hours
23434,1747928,4,EGPH,05/02/2022,"Parking is very convenient for visiting the city center, but sleeping is not recommended unless you are a very heavy sleeper! We left the camper guarded for 5 hours and paid only € 3, great price! ATTENTION! The entrance to the car park is at an angle and is quite difficult with a camper, you have to do some maneuvering!"
23434,1747767,1,choquerohuelva,05/02/2022,"A well-located car park to see the city and the worker very friendly but to sleep, IMPOSSIBLE, noise from bars and discotheques, people around the cars talking, not to mention the noise of the trucks passing through the port all night. I'm sorry but we will NOT be back."
23434,1747196,3,maite64,04/02/2022,"We spent the night there, the noise didn't bother us too much, music yes, it all depends on where you are parked. On the other hand this morning, we paid for two parking spaces, €6.20 which is normal, we take two. Ideal place to visit the city."
23434,1747119,2,PhilippeetFrancoise,04/02/2022,"To visit the city during the day is ok, to sleep at night it's HELL, music until 6:00 in the morning, we were on the verge of leaving in the night. I felt like I was inside a nightclub."
23434,1747074,3,ertruji,04/02/2022,"During the day very well, but at night a lot of noise, on Thursday the port all night cranes and trucks and the bars with very loud music. To sleep with earplugs"

23434,1740264,3,EdtheVantoo,24/01/2022,Easily located for short walk into old town and coastline. Relatively secure as barrier in place but parking area gates remain open. It’s a working port so can be very noisy from 3am onwards. Motorhome preferential rate is ONLY available when paid in cash at kiosk. Motorhomes have to be 5m or less to get the €3.10 rate otherwise double rate is applied. But still very cheap for 24hr city parking.
23434,1739690,2,richmac,23/01/2022,"Good location near to the old town, but some real downsides. Nearby club is very loud from 00:00 to 06:00 on weekends. Discounted rate (€3.10 per night) ONLY available from kiosk - only manned weekdays and Sat morning (so get ticket sorted whilst open). Don’t try and turn into entrance - reverse and drive in head on. Toilets open when kiosk is."

23434,1731244,2,algonzalef,10/01/2022,"We also spent one night with a 7.5 m motorhome and it doesn't matter, the price is the same for everyone. We were there for 28 hours and they charged us about 21 euros. Quite expensive for an overnight stay. I do not give it a one because it is a good place to visit the city and there are not many places in Cádiz near the center. The night we did not rest at all, many noises typical of the port, cranes and trucks."
23434,1725977,1,Cartageneros,04/01/2022,We have been on January 3 and the rate is 18.5 euros for parking 24 hours. It does not compensate having safe and free or cheaper sites in Cádiz. Very noisy and busy.

If you like the noise of the freighters, the bands of the Easter steps and the infernal noise of the discos, without a doubt it is the right place to stay one night. By the way, if the day you leave is a holiday you must pay by machine and they do not charge you the stipulated 3.1 if not 8.05 euros. If it is only to visit it is ideal."

I have to admit that at first I was hesitant to spend the night here but we spent the night super quiet. also the boy at the sentry box super attentive. the bad ... the noises of the work of the port, entrance and exit of trailers. However, it is a very good option in Cádiz Centro."

There were only 4 motorhomes parked and a lot of space so we went to ask if we had not understood. He told us that he has many reservations and that an AC like ours (7.5m) would occupy 4 places (¿?) And had no space for us. Nothing recommendable !!!"

23434,768807,5,johnandkellie,15/01/2020,"Noises but for 3euros it’s a good place to stay. We heard the brass band playing Wednesday and Thursday nights, but they finish by 11, not bad to listen to. Park near the water side, away from the gate.  Also we heard the nightclub 1am-7am Wednesday night also. But overall we would stay again. It’s so close to the old town, very short walk, nice town day and night, and Cádiz is one of the best places we have visited.  No facilities except toilets during the daytime. No camping behaviour, it is a marina car park. Plenty of other MH were there, about 15.  Other cars park there also. We felt safe and slept pretty well.    You take a standard entry ticket (for a car, which costs more), and if you depart when the office is open, then take your ticket to the person in the office and pay 3,10euro per 24hr. If you plan to depart when the office is closed then go to the office when it is open and explain, and pay when they are open.  I think they are open til 7pm or 9pm Monday- Friday.  Plan to see the office, otherwise the price is close to 18euros per 24hrs.  Our gps took us to a different policed entry to the marina. Do not enter here. Further up it’s clearly a car park and you enter there. You have to manoeuvre your car back and forwards a little to enter.   Enjoy Cádiz! Highly recommended!"

For the old games that no longer support the rav and the techno, go to park opposite the night club, you will benefit from the purring of the machinery of the Ferry or other liners, you will have the impression of traveling as a gift. boat while sleeping. 18 euros for me for less than 24 hours."

There is a bar area next to it, and perhaps that is its fault, that there is noise and people who park next to you can put the music of the car high. Even so, recommended area of asphalt, there were quite a few AC."

Maybe worth to try when want to stay here."
23434,601916,2,theroverlanders,05/08/2019,We managed half a decent nights sleep when we stayed here on a Friday night but the reason it is getting two stars is that when we came to exit on Sat afternoon we had to pay €8.05 as the parking person doesn’t work weekends and therefore you have to insert your ticket into the machine.

Make sure you visit attendant with your ticket and pay €3 on arrival, not when you leave which is the normal procedure for other type of parking. Access through barrier is a tight right turn if you enter from the road running along the side of the port wall. You may need to manoeuvre and reverse around the junction corner to enter through barriers. Several motorhomes did this. Be aware that there is a major festival in Cádiz lasting 10 days which always starts on or around the last Thursday in February every year. In the run up to this a 100 piece carnival brass band practices in the road outside the car park with drums and trumpets but this normally finishes by 11pm.

There is a toilet right in front of the little chapel. On the face of it, ""wild camping"" does not seem to be forbidden, but large vehicles do not have the right to take the small path (see photo added)."

It is paved and trees have been placed. We spent a very quiet night and visited the city. 4G Vodafone very good. The bad thing is that there is only one faucet to fill the water and clean the toilet. Updated with some photos."

The area is past the cemetery, you turn left and go up a ramp as if you were going to enter a pavilion with green stripes, you go through the main door and skirt it you will go through a gate that is the discharge area a manhole cover lift to black. Later the land zone is area."

On way back to van a lady stopped us on the lane to warn of a vicious dog on the loose, worried it would attack our dog. We got back in safely. As we sat in the van an enormous dog appeared on waste land behind us. We locked the doors packed up and left. Be very careful!"

23587,1862498,2,Caravanadominguera,30/04/2022,"A little soulless, it is accessed by the dirt path, right next to the sports pavilion. There is a plot of land to park and the tap is in the corner of the pavilion, it is appreciated that it is even with the hose. The sewer is in very bad condition, be careful not to step on it because it is hanging by a thread. The town is no walk away. Overnight is more beautiful upstairs in the monastery."

At the turnoff from the A-3 (roundabout) there is a ""Low cost"" gas station. Things that I did not like: there is no bathroom, the area is quite desolate. Also, thanks for the site."

23587,1703771,2,MartaR.R.,05/12/2021,"You have to pass the cemetery a few meters, and to the left go up a steep hill. Be careful, the AC is very low. We stop just to empty and fill. The sewage box must be raised. The faucet drips. Being free and having nothing else in the surroundings is enough. Nice picture of the Monastery."

We arrived at night, there was no one, and it gave us a bit of a bad feeling so we went to spend the night in the monastery parking lot. The next day we changed the water again, for that good. Gray and black are unloaded in the same box on the ground."
23587,1553775,4,LoreP.,06/09/2021,"Very quiet area, paved, but very little signposted. Good for emptying grays and blacks and for filling water, with a hose, although when we went there was a lot of leakage from the connection of the tap with it."

Not to be confused with some ships that are nearby that are from a construction company, the area is leaving Ucles passing the cemetery. It has a water point through a hose and bathrooms closed by covid. We compare it with the parking of the monastery (which could also be spent the night) and this place better"

For fresh water there is a water fountain with five taps just on the outskirts of town which you will see. Turn right at the fountains to find the road to the disposal site.

The black and grey water disposal is directly down the man hole. The tap for the hose didn't work."

23587,107881,3,eeae,28/09/2016,"At least there is a supply point for the motorhomes. The truth is, to stay to sleep, gives a little respect for the isolation of the place. If I had stayed, I would have done it in the parking lot of the Monastery of Uclés, which I have already marked. By day and if you have to stock up, it goes to the Municipal Area that is relatively close."
23587,74378,4,RoseOlivia,23/05/2016,Very quiet and just up past the cemetery by a white and red barn. The good thing is you can park any side of the barn so there is always shade. Running water with a hose and there is apparently toilets but they were locked when we were there so maybe you need to ask for a key somewhere but to be honest there is nowhere obvious in the town we didn't even find any shops only one restaurant. The place however is very lovely for one day with nice shaded walks before you enter the town and the monastery is worth a visit. Very picturesque.
23587,71753,2,kite_rider,07/05/2016,"Kind of an out of the way place that feels very lonely. Good view of the monastery, but the grounds are packed dirt and littered with some old industrial waste. Took us a while to find the place since the GPS just took us to the cemetery. Didn't expect to go to the grey building - but I added a photo to make it more clear. There was a hose for the water and the cassette waste can be dumped into the man hole once you remove the cover."

23587,58952,2,,29/10/2015,It's summary but better than nothing. there is not much else in the area. To drain wc you have to open the sewer trap ... beautiful view of the monastery and very quiet.
23587,44096,1,paskhy,26/07/2015,"The minimal expression of an area, it is about the parking area of ​​a poorly maintained pavilion, isolated and removed from the town, in which they have a tap hooked to the wall, a drain and to empty the toilet one of the toilets is used from the same pavilion that keeps the door open, I suppose for this reason or because they forgot to close it. For overnight, it is a very quiet place, too quiet, and can be done at any point, there is no reserved area, with lines or signal."
23599,407660,3,cagire,15/11/2018,Parking of the Golf restaurant. Very calm in November. We stay there for a tour of the port and the shopping at the Mercadona which is near. We do not try to spend the night there. It seems to be also the parking lot of the SPA and the hotel

The problem was not the train that could worry but that somewhere nearby there was loud music all night until 6:30. Hell all night PUM PUM PUM PUM... I'm sorry for the people but I won't be back, I don't understand how the city hall or the police allow something like that."

The black waste is vile and blocked but someone has put a cable tie on the manhole cover beneath it so we were able to use that and the tap for toilet rinsing is ok.

If you don't have water, there is a fountain nearby that will serve you even if the hose doesn't hook up properly. People have misused these facilities, it was full of feces.

And with a disco in front open until late, as we slept a few streets up, behind the Civil Guard barracks, and we listened to the music. If he hadn't gone so late, he would surely have looked for another town to sleep in. A shame because the historic center is very beautiful."

Between the hours of 1 - 3 am the train is loading or unloading with the engine running and it repeatedly runs back and forth. This coupled with the water being turned off at the service point and a sign stating that no sleeping is allowed by order of the Mayor despite it being an aire leaves me feeling that they don’t “really” want us here."

We parked facing the services as the run of the ground suited our van shower. But that had our habitation door at the road side. The sign says chocks are not allowed and since we were the only motorhome staying we did not put them under the wheels.
The traffic was ok but if a car or big van passed it rocked the motorhome. The train was intermittent and did not really bother us.
There is no shade which is a pity as there are plenty if seats to sit out. The area is used for dog walking so watch out for some poo about.
Saying all that we had 3 quite nights here. 

There are full free services. 
The grey drain is a small grid and not all vans will be able to park over it. But the ground is sloping towards the drain.
The black WC drain is off the ground with a cover and a tap above it.
The fresh water tap is a small screw-on and is a push type so 2 people are required.
There are small bins and a large bin.

The supermarkets, Dia, Eroski, Consum and Marcadona are 10 minutes walk away. Aldi is on the edge of town further away. Plenty of cafés close by and even one in the train station down the road.

There is an old town with ruins of a castle and other buildings including the aqueduct, executioners tower, boundary walls and many churches."

23620,2529859,5,Stepabene,27/12/2022,"Down on the beach I find it spooky because of the ""locals"" - makes a weird feeling. Lots of anglers. Great for walking the dog. It's okay to sleep at the top of the castle. There are visitors every now and then, but at night I had my peace. I stayed 2 nights. Security didn't say anything either"

The Guardia Local comes by a few times in the evening, but only to check that everything is going well. The ""village youth"" also like to meet here in the evening, but everything is very relaxed. The beach is a bit away, but can be reached in a few minutes on foot, behind the museum. You can also park on the right in front of the paved parking lot on a gravel place. The museum is only open on the weekend in March and April."

23644,3243014,2,slavkinvan,31/08/2023,"Start with the good part: the place is beautiful, the location on the river is enchanting, the hosts are nice. However, the price is too high with no justification (30eur per night), toilets and showers are not maintained enough, it was noisy at night (there was a party), the laundry machine didn’t work, the yoga class didn’t take place in any of the days we were there, the activity for the kids also didn’t happen, the prices is the restaurant are also high."
23644,2660104,4,LeandroNorte,10/04/2023,"the place is beautiful, with the river passing by. We spent only one afternoon, showered and supplied with water. Alex was super kind, but the structures need a bit of Maintenance and cleaning."
23644,2362371,4,CamperMO,11/09/2022,"Secret Garden… the name of the campsite matches what you find. The campsite has reopened with new impetus. The owner does everything to make you feel welcome. Beautiful location. I estimate that in a year's time the campsite will have undergone a huge improvement. The bar and restaurant are really fine. All in all, I think the 35 euros for a bus camper and 2 people is a bit on the high side."

For the rest, very good, if you go at night or in winter I imagine that much better. Right behind is the municipal swimming pool which would have been a great help although unfortunately they do not allow pets."

23645,2963308,2,MMG3,14/07/2023,"The area is a street with 7 squares, very wide but short. It's fine for a stopover on the road: ok water, a park next door and a pool. Some of the photos in the description are of the pool parking lot. We spent the night and since they had to fumigate the trees in the area we had to park next to the pool. Night noise from the tractors that work and pass by."
23645,2935701,5,soniasla,08/07/2023,"Despite the fact that when we arrived at night all 8 spaces were occupied, a little further on there is an area with parking lots, where there were more motorhomes parked and we spent the night. The town is a 2-minute walk away and I recommend having dinner at La Bodega C&R, the owner took great care of us and we had a great dinner at a very affordable price!!"

We spent a horrible night without a wink, the cars passed all night, the tractors at 4 in the morning started their engines... we went in September."
23645,2351942,3,camperturtle,08/09/2022,"Good place to empty and carry, few shadows, but very central. We did not do nights. Better in a bbk park with free tables and public toilets, nearby"

23645,1881370,3,carlosll,10/05/2022,"When they say that the plazas are large, they are actually wide, but they are less than 6 meters long. The area has all the services, but it is similar to an urban parking lot, although quiet without too much hustle and bustle. Without any shade."

When we arrived, everything was occupied and we slept in the adjoining parking lot, because the floor is a little inclined. There is a playground and at night some noise from the boys who went to the swings."

23645,1709333,5,RafaelEMT,13/12/2021,"Very well-kept area next to Sports Center and Railway Museum (Sunday mornings). Gray and black water discharge. free water charge. Natural environment and Wine Routes. We ate near the Area very well on Rte. Astoria for tapas and mixed dishes, excellent cuttlefish and very good value for money (Av. De la Estación, 2). Parking area next to Sports Center for Housing Complexes"

23645,1705808,4,ESCARTIN,07/12/2021,"Very well structured area. Seven ample parking spaces. Emptying of gray, black water and drinking water at no cost. A ten to the City Hall. Visit around the town, consuming in bars and shops. Chapter by part, is the attitude of the owner of the last house, in front of the parking lot, since he rebuked me for a motorhome that had the engine running and that it was not mine. Nor did he apologize."
23645,1686895,4,BillyCountryBob,13/11/2021,"Very calm. the squares that are on the main street are well leveled. At the back there is a larger parking lot, but there are few well-leveled spaces. perfect for a night ""on the way""."

23645,1667075,3,Harri,29/10/2021,To spend a night on the road is not bad. A bit noisy in the morning from tractor traffic. The city council is grateful for the detail of putting an area for ACs.
23645,1609557,5,Carloscalvoconde,26/09/2021,"The area is clean and one step away from the center, therefore recommended. The city leaves a little to be desired except for the famous wine and wineries. The owner of the house right in front of the dump area is a bit special, although he was right when I unloaded / loaded with the engine running due to the heat and having the air conditioning on to resume driving."

A few passages of cars at the end of the activities until 9:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. On the other hand, the neighbors opposite are quite noisy, start a large agricultural machine and let the engine run for almost 10 minutes just at 6:00 in the morning! Nearby traders, restaurants, bars, fast food open until midnight. Free services. Thanks to the municipality of Cariñena"

The restaurant bar is open late in the morning and it is difficult to find somewhere to have coffee. In the middle of nowhere. A very nice place, a pity that it is expensive, with total security more people would go. Of course, everything is very clean."

Beach across the road is quite good but it's also nudist allowed so lots of old men with nothing on along side families with small children. Seems a bit wrong to me.
Good cycle route into Valencia too but we were warned that cycle theft is common."
23770,2707566,2,oleebu,29/04/2023,"The best thing about this campsite? The good bus connection to Valencia! Sanitary facilities are very old, sometimes there are holes in the walls instead of shower heads. At the reception there is a small supermarket, the employees were very friendly overall. But if you're standing at the back of the expressway, it's almost consistently loud... Okay for one night."
23770,2704607,1,Saempf,28/04/2023,"If you don't have high standards, you could spend a night or two at this place. The sanitary facilities are EXTREMELY run down, nothing has been invested in the last few years, if you get a parking space on the motorway, it's extremely loud. The well-developed bike path and the proximity to Valencia are positive. That's it."

He warned us that the only places that were left were small and next to the noise of the road (a lot of traffic) we accepted and they made us pay in advance. The facilities are old, seedy and without maintenance, there are 3 bathroom areas, in one there was no light and in another there was no hot water and the sinks were also without light."
23770,2663710,3,markatu,12/04/2023,"The facilities are complete, for man and camper. However, you need an orientation walk to find everything. Unfortunately, the very friendly lady at reception didn't give any instructions, but I could have asked. The sanitary facilities are as clean as the users leave them and are cleaned regularly. I think 50 euros for 2 nights is a lot in this case."

Nice little bar and shop!! Staff are 100% !! Yes showers are dated but work fine and clean ( i have ocd) i loved it here! Not like a car park! its like a campsite should be.

It's right on a very busy road, the clientele is really questionable, groups of people screaming, bawling and singing late into the night. You have the feeling you are standing at a motorway service station and there is free beer... there is a point for the nice lady at reception. But it's better to be somewhere in a parking lot than here."
23770,2647778,1,Siscu202,07/04/2023,Positive of the campsite: Bus stop at the door to visit Valencia and have the motorhome parked with electricity. Negative of the campsite: It is a campsite from 1970-80 without any reform. It is in a state of abandonment almost of war. There are streets where you can shoot a horror movie. And you can hear the vehicles go by a lot. You can't run away because you pay when you arrive

The services are absent, HS power outlet, no tap to fill up with water, no hot water for the dishes, bad smell in the toilets etc... Even with earplugs it is difficult to sleep the cars are always present. Everything is old and not refurbished, for the price it's not normal. I advise against"
23770,2642341,3,Coonan,05/04/2023,"I agree with many comments: this site is not well run, crowded with small pitches and dated facilities.  The site looks a bit run and not locked at night. I searched for a hot shower and found one in the block amongst the seasonals just on the left of the entrance as you enter.  As site was supposedly full we were offered spaces at the back opposite the empty multi person cabins. Ok as more room!"

This then right next to the immediately adjacent expressway and 7m Womo just fits between the tent and the other Womo. €36 incl. electricity and dog is steep. But very good possibility along the beach with the wheel in the city, as well as friendly front desk"
23770,2215031,5,KathrynHaas,11/08/2022,"Reception speaks DE, FR, NL, ES and probably PT. You definitely cannot reserve in advance. You choose the place yourself. But you can call ahead and ask if there are still spaces available. We had a seat in the shade and you have direct access to more. it doesn't get any faster than that. sanitary facilities are outdated but completely ok and serve their purpose."
23770,2214996,3,dardus80,11/08/2022,"Dated campsite, small swimming pool, dated and unclean toilets. Small pitches with little shade. A point in favor is the bus stop for Valencia just outside the campsite and connection with cycle paths to the city, with electric bikes you can do it easily."

Right next to a freeway and in the airport area it's very, very noisy! Sanitary facilities are clean but old and don't always work properly. Standing places are often tight. The quality of stay is low. Staff is friendly though."

No privacy in the different spots, very open space, the staff in the reception wasn’t very polite and there was a lot of noise from the highway which is just next to the camp site.

Old sanitary ware, hot water for nonexistent dishes. Access to the beach, a little dangerous, you have to walk along the road, there is no access for pedestrians. Nice beach, but nudists ;-) You must know. For one night, enough, beyond that it is not possible, the dog of the neighbor of the campsite barks all the night."

There are a lot of feral cats living on the property and that means a lot of cat poo too. It smells. And expensive! It was low season for 2 people and a camper van €20 for 1 night.

However, what is terrible is the sanitary facilities. They probably haven't been cleaned in years. Disgusting to take a shower (there was a ton of hair in the shower and someone had even done their business in the shower......)."

The path to the beach (from the campsite to the right and then signposted) is fantastic, but sometimes very uneven (stony and sandy). The employees are very friendly."

23784,1378478,1,dieTorners,29/07/2021,The campsite is currently a complete construction site and is totally overpriced. Should have paid 34.50 for 1 adult and 2 small children. The road to the campsite is more for an off-road vehicle
23784,1355351,1,beyerhaus,23/07/2021,Expensive as hell! And the road there is very bad.
23784,1311710,3,irenevandijke,10/07/2021,"The road to the campsite has weird small bumps so you can not drive that fast. Way too expensive. Paid €18,35 for a van with 1 person + electricity. This price is okay if there were some extras (there was only santinary, grey and black water because they are still building). Only thing positive is the path to the nice beach."

Negative: 10.30 € for a VW bus and one person, footpath with surboard too far, access only via hinterland bad gravel road too many cats. It will A new reception with a mini market has just been built. There are no shopping opportunities in a 5km area."
23784,1065854,1,Lolaexploradora,23/09/2020,"We came just to refill the clean water tank, offering to pay a one night stay for it. The answer was a resounding no. Added to that is the access road, which is in such poor condition that we had to go at 5km / h to avoid blowing up the car. If not for sleeping, avoid."
23784,1030553,2,anita25186,06/09/2020,"We have spent one night, the positive points that are going to the beach walking from the Campi and that they have it clean, the negative the Campi stayed in the 50s, the camping area and the motorhomes are unpaved, it does not have a pool and the bathrooms are very old with the pipes still on the outside. If they improved their facilities it would be a much better place. Two adults and a camper 15 euros without electricity. They are doing a work at the beginning I guess it will be a new reception and maybe they will do something else, which would be good for them. We sleep soundly and the quiet time is from 11 at night to 8 in the morning."
23784,674910,2,Shari,03/09/2019,"Campers are not really welcome. Space is large and offers beautiful areas. However, with the camper you are only allowed to stand side by side in the sun in the far corner. Washrooms could also be cleaned more often. Bread only to order the night before (which unfortunately nobody says). Conclusion: Designed on bungalows. Ideal for disposal, otherwise you can save the place well."
23784,625540,3,mochileros,13/08/2019,€ 17 has cost us the van + 2 people. It has no supermarket. It is a family camping and quiet.

The colony of wild cats are really a cute feature worth mentioning. The dirt road leading there is fine and the staff is really friendly"

23807,3199311,3,rosaguerrero,22/08/2023,A great place. Tables and shade. The road is very noisy. You can hear all the traffic going by. If you are a weak sleeper like me you will get almost no sleep

23807,3135372,4,crischao,13/08/2023,Nice place to spend the night with tables and water. The downside is the noise of the cars that pass by being very close to the road.

23807,2993669,5,HijaDelKaos,20/07/2023,"Site well located to access with motorhomes. If you want to go to redwood park, there is a trail behind the guardrail on the road. The only thing is that if you have dogs and are adventurous, you have to be careful with the road ahead. If the noise of cars bothers you, it is not your ideal place either. But it is very prety."
23807,2915831,4,acontia,02/07/2023,"Sitting area with stone benches - a bit high for children. When we arrived, an AC was being towed by a crane because it had sunk into the wet ground (on the right as you enter). Be careful with the terrain, better to park on the road."
23807,2826360,5,Andrea-Dinis,06/06/2023,A perfect shady picnic area. We escaped from the heat and it was a perfect place to stop to eat and rest for a while. Also super close to the A8

23807,2543325,3,JuliaG90,06/01/2023,"Good for one night, a bit exposed, not particularly bucolic, near the road so you can hear traffic, but the best option we found locally. But it has water and picnic tables"

The place was COVERED IN DIRT, apparently there was a party and the attenders were so disrespectful to leave the place very unclean.

Buses with the engine running until midnight, cars with loud music all night long, the last one came around 3am. Perfect for exploring the city, as access from above, the cathedral only takes about 10-15 minutes."
23828,2758423,3,Chrislan_at,17/05/2023,"We only spent the day here, but it was packed. There are gorillas asking for money. The truth is that I screwed up a bit going up, it's quite narrow and you have to be careful with the height, at the intersection with another vehicle, it's complicated."
23828,2758313,2,vwt6raquelyalex,17/05/2023,A normal place for one night to visit the old town!
23828,2751445,5,juanfrantejero,15/05/2023,"I spent the night in this parking lot with my van, and there is no sign that prohibits it. It is the best place to see the old town. Motorhome is tricky as the car parks are narrow and sloping."

you can also make beautiful walks from here."
23828,2607353,3,Guille4mx,12/03/2023,"Incredible views, crowded in summer. It was difficult for us to find a hole and on top of that it was inclined. We stayed one night and the police came by but they didn't tell us anything. There is a very nice area of trees and nature next door and also very close to the old town. Good site overall."
23828,2544562,4,kimhakunamatata,07/01/2023,"It is perfect for touring Cuenca. The most beautiful views of the city from here. Large and free parking, but inclined. The night very very quiet."

Everything is very clean, very close to the old town, along a beautiful path, the police pass by in the morning but they don't say anything. I spent 3 days sleeping alone with two dogs. I would go again it's a little steep"
23828,2403709,5,eewanders,26/09/2022,"One day and one night stop, I arrived on a rainy afternoon, I went to dinner at one of the restaurants on that same street, there was very little traffic through this car park, a lot of free spaces more or less straight ahead. Ideal views when you wake up and a good point to run down in the park and continue through the old city to visit it, have a coffee and return to the van"
23828,2213224,5,Luciernaga13,10/08/2022,"Full of cars but at the same time super calm and quiet (on a Wednesday), good views, close to the city and the river."

23828,1961815,4,Erica68,09/06/2022,"we spent the night in the highest part of the car park, with a slight slope, at the beginning of June, nice views, there were more caravans, some noise from music and cars, but then a quiet night until 7:30 when buses arrive and activity from the road . but in summary we think it is an acceptable place"
23828,1947778,3,MariaIglesias12,05/06/2022,Incredible views and very close to the old town on foot. Nearby there are several bars and restaurants but it is not noisy. The bad thing is that it is on the slope. Although you can find somewhere flatter.
23828,1901200,5,josmarlor,19/05/2022,"Good place, quiet and with good views, to visit the city and spend a night. To get to this parking lot you have to cross the old town and a motorhome can do it without any problem."
23828,1894448,4,alocen69,16/05/2022,"I think you can't go through the old town with the motorhome to get to this car park. There is a prohibition sign for trucks as soon as you start the climb. However, the symbol of the ACs does not appear. It also marks a height limit of three meters. We'll see if I get a fine. And indeed, it is a somewhat noisy place to sleep."
23828,1874363,4,Eltorado,07/05/2022,Weird but good for one night. Close to the old town and with beautiful views. Police drive by several times. Many people come to the parking lot until late in the evening and early in the morning

23828,1785982,3,SimonandVicky,17/03/2022,Park up only in the car park not on waste ground opposite. Wait for day trippers to leave then you can park across bays if you need to. Be aware the local bus and tourist train turning area. Very close to local bars and restaurants.
23828,1782295,2,laclassebuissonniere,13/03/2022,"This car park is very well placed for visiting the old town. We took a path from the lookout that descends to the bridge. Return through the alleys. On the other hand, there is no flat site. And a lot of cars and buses park here. People take advantage of nearby restaurants, hotels and bars. Thank you for indicating to take the tour by road. Very pretty, too!"

23828,1723401,5,isidrosanchez,02/01/2022,"Good parking to see the old town and the hanging houses (10 minutes walk) To get there, I recommend taking a detour towards the hotel cave of the friar, avoid crossing the narrow streets of the town. We slept on New Year's Eve with four other motorhomes and very quiet. Nearby there are very good places to eat or have tapas."

We agreed by going around the Cueva del Fraile hotel. On weekends the Historic Center of Cuenca is only for residents or for indoor parking, on weekdays you can cross. The main drawback is that parking is on a hill, although we slept well."
23828,1512090,1,mclouismc4333,25/08/2021,Bottle site. Advisable only during the day.
23828,1314084,1,Ruttp,11/07/2021,You can't get there. The police were at the entrance to the street and only residents could go up.
23828,1223213,1,carlosura,29/05/2021,Bottle on Friday night. The bars must have closed at 1 am and they all came here with the music and the bottles.

Then I have informed myself and on weekends it is better not to stay overnight because they tend to make a lot of noise"
23828,1187606,3,lacamp20,07/05/2021,"Very nice place with magnificent view, as specified the access is via the old town, wide street for one, but crossing with another can be limited, go there quietly and there will be no problem the city buses pass there permanently . free, no service. probably to be avoided from Friday evening to Sunday because a lot of restaurants and bars, therefore crowds and noise."
23828,1101947,4,malcon,22/10/2020,"The place is not bad, better in the area of land since in the parking a car plays with music. the bad thing is that there was a storm and the best views are very exposed. The municipal authorities told me that to get out better on the other side by taking a detour since crossing the city with my car could be complicated 7.40 m and there is a narrow arch. walking you are next to the main thing"
23828,1025867,1,Paichi,04/09/2020,"Friday night, bottle. People for all the entertainment venues in the area. Sleep and rest, impossible"

23828,750769,4,Dan-el,07/12/2019,Ideal place to visit Cuenca and spend the night. There are no services but there are restaurants and the old town is just minutes away. In the bridges and holidays they close the access through the old town so it is difficult to arrive.

23828,745498,4,theroverlanders,21/11/2019,We managed to get a spot here around lunchtime on a weekend so were lucky.  It’s great to walk down to Cuenca on the marked path and then back to the car park through Cuenca. We didn’t stay the night.

You can climb through the town although they are narrow streets and you have to pass a narrow arch that we pass with our 2.90 high motorhome. from the parking lot there are a couple of very nice hiking trails
23828,739750,4,ferola,07/11/2019,"Although we do not use it out of respect for the narrow streets and doors to be crossed, I have to confirm that there should be no problems. We have seen buses and vans pass without problems. It can be very windy and cold up there."
23828,738694,5,Pedro_61,05/11/2019,"Very close to the town center, it has spectacular views of Cuenca and the sickles of Huecar and Jucar, you have to arrive soon, on weekends and bridges fill up fast. Slightly inclined. In the tourist office they told us that you can only spend the night one night."
23828,738094,5,bert198,04/11/2019,We have spent 2 nights at the bridge of All Saints and the truth is great especially because of the proximity to the main square. The places are slightly inclined but the ones at the top are better. It is not very big x what is better to arrive soon by night. For very large cars you have to pass the whole old town but it is good. If you go with children visit the Mupa I went by taxi x 6 e
23828,734467,3,palomita,31/10/2019,Appropriate to get out of the way. We slept on a Saturday and there was a lot of mess throughout the night due to the proximity of the bars. close to the center.
23828,724742,4,VictorP,18/10/2019,"We did not spend the night, but we do use it to visit the old town of Cuenca, and the truth is that it has a privileged location: magnificent views, and near the old town to visit on foot."
23828,674036,4,Pochologc,02/09/2019,Ideal to visit the old town. In slight slope.
23828,670130,4,imazzius,31/08/2019,"Inclined, but don't even think about wearing chocks or opening casement windows, chairs, tables ... it's a parking lot, not an area, and they fine. Being discreet, no problem. very quiet night in the morning a gorilla or valet parking appeared, who asked us for money .... but parking is free. very well located to see the cathedral or the hanging houses."
23828,487968,5,Corarocio,19/05/2019,"Quiet parking, with views, ideal for visiting the city on foot. A little inclined but in the area of land is perfect to sleep. Free."

23828,413253,3,VacacionesNomadas,10/12/2018,"Beautiful views from the highest point of Cuenca, without services. Some inclination, but do not even think about putting wedges, fine, although you can spend the night without ""camping""."
23828,405665,4,Pasava21,07/11/2018,"We had a good night with good views, although uneven. There is a fountain nearby to fill bottles. You can access the old town from a dirt road with good views."
23828,402961,4,Ruby2016,02/11/2018,"Good spot for visiting the old city and for the views. Big campers should go round the city, not through (you will not fit through the end gate). Parking for local residents only in the old city. Normal cars have to mount the low pavements when crossing each other."
23828,401973,4,mimanolo,31/10/2018,Perfect to spend the night and visit the old city. something uneven. The access by the center a little steep but the buses pass without problems
23828,391464,3,RubCar,11/10/2018,"Good place to park while visiting the city, but not so much to spend the night. He is leaning and you can hear the sounds and music of the nearby bars. To get there you have to cross the whole city and go up through the old town."
23828,372490,4,gilles1310,13/09/2018,"Ok for one night but no more. It goes up without problem, you have to take the bus route. I used Google Maps to access it. In season I think it is better to go to Ciudad Encatada, about 30 km north of Cuenca, large parking under the trees nearby, hotel, bar, restaurant, and toilets on the other side of the road"
23828,254597,3,Tarttine,17/05/2018,Sloping but near the historic center. Calm. No problem to get to the car park
23828,233635,5,haytor,05/04/2018,"Very good place to sleep and visit the old part, although it is true that the streets to get to it are a bit complicated but buses go up. I used another alternative coming from the enchanted city on the 2105 county road."
23828,221486,3,Connan-PBG,04/02/2018,"Good site for sightseeing and good views. The car parks are not level, and at night there is a lot of coming and going of car, but you can do a concert with the horn of a car a panda of ..."

23828,172480,5,missesturao,12/08/2017,"Free public parking of El Castillo neighborhood. Recommended by the Tourist Office (very nice, by the way) Incredible views and quiet. You have to park in the morning because in the afternoon the Cuencans who come to this area park for a drink in the afternoon / night. Water fountain nearby."
23828,153163,4,NeskaEspe,17/07/2017,"According to the tourist office, you can now park during the day, but if you stay overnight, you will be fined. Detail to take into account."

In the morning, Friday and Saturday, there is a gorrilla. Narrow street to go up to the parking lot in the center. the Paseo del Huecar and take the CUV-9144 to the junction with the CUV-9141 direction Buenache de la Sierra and hotel Cueva del Fraile and from there to the car park of the Castle neighborhood. Great rodeo but no problems. Mandatory itinerary for coaches."
23828,121423,4,largo78,26/02/2017,"Perfect place to see the historic center, it is advisable to come early because to get there you have to cross the historic center and it is up and narrow"
23828,121220,4,lucebinouze,24/02/2017,"Nice parking to spend the night. The night a little noisy with passing cars honking (party animals). Direct departure to the circuits of excursions where to visit the beautiful high city. Bars \ restaurants nearby. Stop the buses at the top of the car park, be careful to park on the squares and not elsewhere. Nice view too!"
23828,119329,4,cantbu,04/02/2017,"Very close to all the old town. The only problem is that when there is wind, it hits hard there. I recommend to put a little to the shelter"
23828,115702,4,JMRIKO,09/12/2016,"Recommended place to visit the old part of the city. No services, but sleep very quiet"
23828,103830,5,IPalma,08/09/2016,"A great place to stay because it has quick access to the upper part of the city and the views are beautiful. It has a source to fill bottles but nothing else. It is uneven. When we were there, a gang of boys arrived who looked like they were going to make a fuss but ate some pizzas and left."
23828,96462,1,Josafat,17/08/2016,I did not like the place because there were two poorly painted young men who asked you for their will and insisted that you give them more money. I preferred to go to the center and pay for the caravan park. Much closer to everything.
23828,76154,4,kevivan,09/06/2016,Place to spend the night with incredible views over Cuenca. Advised by tourism. The local police performs rounds periodically. I recommend not entering the center especially with large ac. Buses go by and there are difficulties if you cross because the street is narrow.
23828,70547,4,jean-claude65200,28/04/2016,"Great location although access by a long, steep street and a bit narrow to cross cars, but a part in alternating traffic. Plunging view of the magnificent colgadas casas, especially at night."
23828,66672,5,aitorfg,29/03/2016,"Perfect parking to explore the city, stunning views."
23828,66558,5,Ruth,28/03/2016,Parking of the castle district ideal to visit the city. incredible views to the hamlet of the jucar and the hanging houses. Something uneven and very crowded. better to arrive at the first or last hour and avoid entering the center of the basin
23828,58221,3,neoon,23/10/2015,To the parking lot you have to arrive in the early morning or you will not have room. Also put leveling chocks since it is somewhat inclined. Wonderful views. It is recommended to go up in the back area even if you turn more because there is little height.
23882,3280273,4,Rafa111106,10/09/2023,Friendly staff and park with all the necessary conditions about 200 meters from a spectacular beach. I recommend
23882,3241661,4,Pleguejr,31/08/2023,"Very friendly staff and right next to the beach, beach bar right on it. Activities for children, permanent and the Animation changes depending on the day. On the weekend we did notice more noise than expected, but totally bearable."
23882,3187504,4,justy,20/08/2023,"Our stay was satisfactory, we stayed for a week and we had a great time especially all the children, it is very crowded but because it is super big, and depending on the plot that touches you, the experience also changes depending on the environment you are looking for. For our part, everything is great except for the dust that there is during the day."
23882,3163791,2,HenselGretel,17/08/2023,Too expensive for pitches so close together. Too noisy after midnight…
23882,3084267,2,LaRamonettadeBlan,05/08/2023,"Crowded place, with a lot of vehicle traffic all day, insufficient bathrooms, queue for the shower and none adapted for babies and without changing tables. there is a lot of dust from the vehicles. Loud all day. our pitch was wide but some are small and sloping. The animation is good if you don't get next to your plot, what a volume all day!"
23882,3007042,5,reindersgeert,23/07/2023,"I don't understand the negative reviews! Fantastic large pitch in the shade, Spanish campsite with associated pleasant bustle No noise at night while it is super high season and the reception did their utmost to find a place despite the fact that the campsite was fully booked Highly recommended !!"
23882,2947272,1,jaimufi,10/07/2023,"We were in a motorhome for 1 night. The free camping area looks like Benidorm, a lot of people who seem to live there, and a very crowded campsite. It took 2 hours to connect the light. There was a queue to go to the showers. There is no toilet paper in the bathrooms."
23882,2920868,1,Janinakoesling,03/07/2023,super loud!!! I can't. If we didn't have 2 small children we would have gone back that night.
23882,2920644,1,koesling,03/07/2023,"Totally overpriced! At 10:00 p.m., loud music suddenly starts with moderation in the middle of the campsite! The showers are warm, but the cabins are so small that you automatically wash your clothes too... one star because the staff at reception was friendly, at least! 50€ for one night 2 adults A bus and 2 toddlers!"
23882,2919841,2,dachzeltreich,03/07/2023,"Huge and noisy...if you are looking for peace and nature, this is not the place for you. All very touristy and designed for the masses. Price since 01.07. (high season) for a plot 45 € / low season 35 €. In our opinion, the price/performance ratio is not in the least correct."
23882,2904857,3,juanjo3133,29/06/2023,"I am not camping and I confirm it, good facilities, close to the beach, with shade but, expensive and very crowded, it looks like a refugee camp if you want tranquility, don't even think about it."
23882,2828856,5,AlbertoRodri,07/06/2023,"Located in a very beautiful natural environment and natural shade, close to the beach, good facilities and very clean. Electricity is included in the price."
23882,2723462,5,ManilaTao,04/05/2023,Good campground. We’ve been here with our baby and we happy they had us for a couple of nights (we stayed close to the playground and the pool). Everything clean and nice big pitches. Short walk to a nice and Long Beach. We would come again!
23882,2693122,1,Krouge,24/04/2023,Overpriced campsites
23882,2609281,4,AnitaLotze,14/03/2023,"nice place to stay. a very big campsite with large places. it's very calm here even during a weekend. lovely place to walk with dogs (beach, forest, dunes). the road is a bit noisy though. friendly people at the reception. could rest very well there"
23882,2587970,4,Womofriend,23/02/2023,"Have been here for the second time. Nice place. Take steel nails with you. Dogs allowed, clean place."
23882,2580601,4,Bustaking,17/02/2023,"The pine processionary moth is widespread in the Mediterranean region, but now seems to be doing well in more northern climes as well. The poisonous hairs of the imported animals and their conspicuous nests can lead to eczema and poisoning in humans. Unfortunately, it is also available here at the moment. The place is relatively empty, at least today. Sunday is carnival, so it will probably be fuller."
23882,2558918,4,TinaKidney,23/01/2023,"Nice place to stay. Nice hot shower. a little tired. Great to spend a night, offload and refill but would stay any longer.  beautiful beach opposite."
23882,2556467,3,andreasliebe,20/01/2023,"Relatively shady campsite. Only a few sunny pitches. No reservation, but enough free places in January. Offered ONLY with electricity. From 2023 with ACSI €23/day, week for €138, month for €460. Without ACSI €470. Advance payment only. Sanitary houses clean. WiFi very slow. Very friendly reception. Beautiful beach within walking distance. Not far into town and to the Lidl."
23882,2545724,3,BJB8586,07/01/2023,"I thought it was ok for one night or passing through, but I don't understand why people like to stay here longer. There are beautiful plots but also very dubious ones, fortunately you were free to choose in January. Sanitary building modern, BUT some campers are really piglets, as the toilets look here in part. Showers completely without storage options, I switched to the one for the disabled :/"
23882,2496209,1,fundp,15/11/2022,"Close to the beach! Toilets modern and clean. Shady place between trees. Unfortunately, the long-term campers are very ignorant and let their dogs bark all the time (they are tied up in front of the trailer home) or loud music is heard. Furthermore, long-term campers do not use the normal paths and walk across the square. Relaxation doesn't come up for us like that."
23882,2470142,5,amilpin080,29/10/2022,"The Sep/Oct offers are very good. €50 the weekend with adventure activities (trees, archery and climbing wall for 2 adults and up to 3 children. Large pitches. The emptying even to pressure wash the car. Party Spectacular Halloween. We will repeat."
23882,2451961,5,BrisndsdeMendoza,19/10/2022,"It is a privileged place, very friendly staff, calm and quiet place (it will be for the time of year) we have spent a night changing waters two adults and motorhomes €18. the services are all correct, the showers are clean. highly recommended."
23882,2416352,1,Palmeras,01/10/2022,"Good location and clean services, but rest is impossible since there is no quiet time (neither nap time nor night time) nor does anyone from the campsite control the noise. It is the law of the jungle. Recommended campsite to set up uncontrolled parties but not to rest or disconnect."
23882,2329905,2,Hirurok,01/09/2022,"Positive: location almost on the beach and close to the town, they accept dogs free of charge, very friendly staff, fairly level ground. Negatives: dirty-neglected (also the beach dune is horribly dirty), pool opens late (12:00) and small, the green of the pool full of cigarette butts, small showers, long-stay caravaners have turned the campsite into favelas, scarce market, sandy soil and full of pine needles, some streets are narrow to maneuver motorhomes."
23882,2319749,2,rizosalbai,30/08/2022,"Very neglected campsite. It seems incredible that it has 4 stars. Very careless bathrooms, you wait for 1 hour to take a shower. The time of entry to the campsite is very late at 15:00 in the afternoon. The plaza was occupied and it took 2 hours. The mosquitoes scorched us."
23882,2315967,2,Novatis,29/08/2022,"Negative: abusive price (we paid 70 euros for a 6m motorhome, 4 adults and a child), a bit shabby children's activities, uneven and sandy pitches, some should not even be offered for motorhomes since you could not even unfold the awning or put a table outside, and the mosquitoes.Positive: friendly staff, very clean bathrooms (the cleaning lady must have lived there), beach 50m away"
23882,2286246,2,VitorAlves,22/08/2022,"Excessive price. Poorly organized activities including several employees did not share the same information and so it became confusing. Lots of dust and some noise. The pool is quite small for the size of the park. However, it is close to the beach and the bathrooms were always clean and fragrant."
23882,2278855,2,Pepomut7,21/08/2022,"Very crowded and very noisy campsite. The prices seem excessive to me, 2 adults with a motorhome, €50/day. The pool is small for the number of people there. Queues to shower constantly. Very pleasant treatment of workers."
23882,2215618,3,GurutzeEtxaniz,11/08/2022,"Free camping in sand, everyone gets where they can. Quite crowded. Many mosquitoes, take some spray. Little control with the noise issue and 0 respect, children hitting stores, adults yelling and screaming..."
23882,2212901,3,PimsMotorhome,10/08/2022,"Despite having a lot of people and a lot of dust, the facilities are reasonable. 5 minutes walk from the beach and excellent quality. Reception and staff very attentive. High price for campervan 2 adults and 2 children, 50€. to flush gray water is not easy."
23882,2167123,4,Rafikis,03/08/2022,"Large campsite, spacious pitches in a pine forest area, so most pitches have at least partial shade. Good reception (tip: contact by whatsapp to check availability; they answer almost immediately). Well cared for although the bathrooms are fair. Many fixed but not ""ugly"", good atmosphere and quiet. A few meters from a beautiful beach and a walk from the town. Highly recommended!"
23882,2097561,3,NunoRequixa,20/07/2022,Excellent location with lots of shade close to a magnificent beach. Toilets and showers could be separate. Very attentive staff. Something expensive: 45 euros per night for the campervan and two people. Very small pool and outside path to the beach very dirty.

23882,1989023,2,anderecke,18/06/2022,"Extremely expensive. We paid €35 for a Van with two people, dog and electricity. The site is full of permanent campers who come on weekends, on vacation and for celebrations. Therefore loud music and drunks are normal. People know each other and if you arrive new or are a foreigner they look at you like a weirdo. No privacy. The positive: clean bathrooms and hot water"

Unfortunately, the site is very dusty and the plots lack any privacy. The price-performance ratio is clearly not right here at 35€ for 2 people per night."
23882,1933014,4,Pipok,30/05/2022,"To add to other reviews, lots going on here. Canoe hire €5 on site, archery, good playgrounds & lots of nice flat walking around. Cycle lane to the centre. Short walk to a small cluster or restaurants. Yes there are a lot of long term caravans here like on many Spanish & Portuguese sites but it’s big enough to find a pitch away from these & there are plenty of bathrooms."

23882,1854791,2,Aramatdivad,26/04/2022,"Not recommended for camping, uneven and dirty sandy floors. We did not rate it with one star because the bathrooms were correct, although they do not have a place to put things to shower. To highlight: it has the beach in front and a nice walk to Isla Cristina."

Across the road through pine forest very nice beach. Still very quiet at the end of March. Well with the bike to Isla Christina and the surrounding area, all inlet options."
23882,1809121,1,Hugues02,07/04/2022,"I did not understand. Turned back at the entrance by a worker who tells me it's closed. We didn't insist, the pitches didn't appeal to us."
23882,1799418,3,HaMoSprinterVan,28/03/2022,"The site is big and good, but there are a lot of permanent campers who are loud, leave their rubbish everywhere and behave completely wrong.

23882,1745126,2,isabellevincent,31/01/2022,At first sight nice but waste of old flat rate surely ??? for the very surprising price of being in the middle of all this... we made a direct U-turn

23882,1442810,3,ttattinniss,12/08/2021,"Positive: next to the beaches, children's entertainment, super nice monitors, decent facilities, large pitches. Negative: crowded plots, they do not assign you one, many occupied by cars, sand traps, a lot of noise and in our case, the passage through our plot was constant to avoid a detour. Many disrespectful people with music, garbage and camping should act."

Be careful when choosing the plot, many are a sand trap."

There are quite a distance but large pitches, some with good shade and close to the beach or Isla Cristina 20 walking or bike lane.

For an overnight stay, I don't recommend it."

The train station is not a problem -

Police have passed through the parking area which is reassuring. Sadly the 3k shoreline esplanade has been decimated by Storm Gloria. Warning, slowly does it on entry some big potholes. There is a water fountain on the approach road, Carrer Llarg, Nr a small play area, opposite a tennis court but it wasn’t working at the time of my visit. Small Supermarket proprietors very friendly, held my dog whilst I shopped. A few bars and restaurants, obviously most closed. What it would be like summer??? But it’s a nice location do lets respect the area and preserve it. There is another water fountain, that was working, it’s in the centre of the village next to the telephone kiosk."

I would suggest parking considerately (drive into a space don’t park sideways) as there are a lot of boat trailers that need to park in the carpark too. Lovely sunrise!
23920,391482,5,Jmarn,11/10/2018,"Very good place to spend the night and for a health walk or jog on the seafront. Quiet and quiet. Indeed, as mentioned in a previous comment the road is a little broken down on the last 200 meters before reaching the parking lot, but it should not be exaggerated, it goes very easily rolling quietly."

Beach with lots of cigarette butts, dog crap laying around. Toilets are immaculate, site safe but not worth €55 in low season and €130 in high season for a small family per night? That's €220,000 per night turnover! Nearly €7m per month. Crazy prices"

It's an ideal spot for anyone with dogs or mountain bikes, it's along a greenway and there's loads of space in the evening when there's no one around to let dogs off lead. It's quiet and well maintained. We had it to ourselves apart from the cyclists and walkers on the green way."

The power connection is only on one side. For the more distant places you would probably need a longer cable. The place itself is nice too. Shopping, pharmacy approx. 500m. small drawback, street noise. I would definitely go again."
23961,1703379,5,josep007,05/12/2021,"A perfect place! There are only five spaces but you can park next door, in some spaces for large vehicles. In the village you can go for breakfast at Casa Rosa, good and well priced."

Free light but it is next to the mares and the last square needs an extension of 30 meters. Squares not level but wide. 2 picnic tables and trash. Perfect location. We hope they make more places soon.

Our six meter van can be parked under a shaded area. There is a large park with picnic tables, and playground. The walk along the river is wonderful. And to go to the center on foot, it takes about 20 minutes. But going for tapas and wine in Soria is worth the effort. Sleep, you sleep peacefully."

However aging campsite poorly equipped, no hot water in some showers or for washing dishes, sinks and laundry. Very very noisy campsite due to some families. Price too high for the services offered."

24042,2611525,5,matemalin,16/03/2023,"Centrally located within walking distance to everything. You can arrive late & then go to reception to check in in the morning. Clean sanitary facilities & plenty of space in the off season, certainly very crowded in the summer."
24042,2601138,4,giulia96,06/03/2023,"Good experience. True, sometimes the showers aren't super hot, but we were able to use them anyway. Large and very clean bathrooms, outdoor area with sinks for dishes and clothes. Spacious pitches and despite being in the center of the village, it is now quiet, and you wake up with the chirping of birds. A vaccination certificate is required for dogs. In the low season, one night is free for three nights."

Sanitary area outdated, without toilet seats. shower ice cold. They weren't willing to increase the shower water temperature. We then checked out after 2 nights of ice cold showers at the campsite. Only recommended for cold shower lovers"

The pet policy is kind of strict, also asking the vaccine pass for the dog at check-in and no dogs allowed in high season. It's cheaper then the other camping just across the street. Very quiet and calm little town worth visiting!"

I only have one problem that we encountered yesterday: a herd of sheep and goats, which would not have been a problem if it weren't for the shepherd dog, a huge Saint Bernard, who started barking protectively when he saw our dog . We had to put the poor man back in the van and we didn't feel comfortable about it."
24089,897386,5,Bicha17,25/07/2020,"Highly recommended place, since it is super cool despite the heat that is falling in the area. There is quite a lot of shade, although the parking lot is not very large. Picnic area with several benches and only two tables. It is next to the river with very cool water to cool off. Wonderful!"

24101,3262109,1,Darlye,05/09/2023,"Just profitability, on top of each other, they don't care about your comfort, it's putting as much of a motorhome as possible, never again! 1 week alone out of season 270 euros, not even room for the high wind table and chairs, a real horror"
24101,3138459,2,nitro1998,13/08/2023,"High level profitability, never again, an exorbitant price for a ridiculous location or in could not even put a table. No thank you, I do not endorse this kind of camping"

24101,3051958,4,mageo1,31/07/2023,"Near the beach, beach restaurant (the Bajamar recommended) and citadel (50m) Price: €56 for 2 adults and motorhome. When you arrive, they tell you a location, but if for some reason it doesn't suit you, move around, there is no actual location. That's what we did because we didn't have no shade and we were told nothing. Swimming pool small, unsupervised and poorly maintained."

24101,3028626,3,BarmenTimo,27/07/2023,"Open in winter which was the reason for our stay. Very cheap in the low season. Very nice location right on the sea. Unfortunately, the winter months are used for construction work, which means that stuff is lying around everywhere and noise is made all day long. But very good for sleeping. Sanitary facilities not so great, but you can take a shower. Don't forget slippers."
24101,3026319,4,MAGH,26/07/2023,"We stayed one night because the RV park was full. With a 7 and a half motorhome plus bikes, we did not find it difficult to maneuver. friendly staff. Clean and uncrowded pool. It is a campsite in the town, next to the beach and very close to Roses. The bad thing is that the plots are very close together without much privacy. As a place of passage very well. 73 euros with electricity and 4 adults."
24101,3014259,2,Flair13,24/07/2023,"very very expensive you have to be an acrobat to maneuver on tiny aisles and pitches, to flee"

24101,2903075,3,JoseRoyo,29/06/2023,"I was in the area around 8:30 p.m. I called, I booked and very well with all the services and swimming pool. I paid €54 for one night. 2 adults 2 children and a motorhome of 7 m. The promenade and beach 2 minutes away, the walk is very lively at night."
24101,2879270,1,Shorty21,22/06/2023,"There's still a lot of room for improvement. The plots are not clearly separated, which means that many campers sometimes occupy 2 or more pitches. No hedges or other separation, so no privacy. Sanitary clean but otherwise neglected as well as the rest of the CP. Generally very loud through the street and in the evening very long loud music. We didn't feel particularly comfortable here."
24101,2874042,1,newstory,20/06/2023,"from 24 € by phone we went to 40 on the spot .. well yes on June 23 we go scammed. the garbage is in front of the entrance to the baby changing room and the sanitary facilities, the water pipe drags the usher on the floor speaks Spanish with you but French with the regulars! a piece of advice, take driving lessons before parking your vehicle between the trees."

We would definitely not go to this place again."

Nothing to say to be in a very touristy place 200 meters from the restaurant and trade beach.
24101,2739902,4,ansudo,10/05/2023,"We were just there and paid €67.39 for 2 nights with two people. Very friendly German speaking staff at the reception, for 5 € you can use the washing machine, beach, restaurants etc. so to speak ""around the corner"". We basically felt comfortable, but you can't ignore the street."
24101,2735575,2,beb-lu,09/05/2023,Agree with previous comment: tiny location and on top of each other. But very well located and toilets at the top. Just one night helps out but the price is excessive (compared to some other car parks for CCar and that's a campsite!!!)
24101,2735056,3,domigranier,08/05/2023,"Well located campsite, very clean sanitary facilities, friendly staff, downside concerning the pitches not delimited without any greenery and the exorbitant price for a cc33 € per night Limited Wi-Fi People from the south"

24101,2686639,4,maviperdomo,21/04/2023,Expensive but good value for money. Ten minutes from the city center. The excellent facilities
24101,2677615,3,saviorant,17/04/2023,"updated costs € 29.15 per day for 2 people with the camper without electricity from 1 to 6 nights beyond it becomes € 21.20. The wifi they do for only 5 hours for the entire period of stay and being in time when you don't use it you have to disconnect using their instructions. the pitches are all on the ground and therefore very dusty, you don't have any shade because they brought the plants"
24101,2628995,3,ElVeterano,29/03/2023,"Although I'm no fan of campsites this one is ideally placed to visit the town and all its restaurants and other attractions. We were there 2 nights and caught the last 2 days of the famous 'tapas trail', tapas and drink €3. And at €2 a night (off season) more than than the AC aire just up the street it's ideal.

Therefore also for several nights completely ok."
24101,2618227,3,Chantal.M,21/03/2023,Very very small pitches. One Womo on the other. We pay 25 euros 2 adults and 2 children and dog per night. Sanitary facilities very simple and not very clean. Nice personel. Close to the beach

The only downside is the pitches which are small but you can still put a table and chairs. The campsite is quiet. Price for a van and 2 people with electricity: €19.36
24101,2586117,3,lionelpillods,21/02/2023,the campsite is very well placed but it looks more like a motorhome area than a campsite. the places are very small and you have to maneuver to park
24101,2582275,5,CloharsC,18/02/2023,Tight but very well organized and super clean campsite. There is room to take out table and chairs and eat outside. Very friendly staff. The ideal is to have your bike for shopping and walking on the cycle paths.

24101,2554375,1,Millon,17/01/2023,"Close to the city center and the beach, but difficult to park with a large motorhome, a lot of manoeuvring. Piled up, no demarcation, it's a car park not a campsite. I will not return here, too expensive for the services, 19.35 e in January, paying wifi. I will only stay one night."
24101,2554281,3,coockie57,17/01/2023,Friendly welcome. Very neat and well maintained sanitary facilities. Places flat but close together. Small shop directly at the campsite. Close to beach.
24101,2551899,4,zombies,14/01/2023,"Not bad.
Friendly staff
Best showers I've used, well heated (under floor), hot showers.
It's a nice pleasant town, quite a lot open for January, plenty of places to eat, fairly busy."
24101,2548452,3,Fabs.Sco,10/01/2023,"Unfortunately, it is more of a parking lot with very narrow parking spaces that do not invite you to linger. The proximity to the beach is great, but in winter that doesn't make up for the bare, narrow gravel pitch. Good sanitary facilities, more of a place for transit. Next time we would prefer an adjoining pitch."
24101,2542946,3,Campinglovers6762,05/01/2023,"I realise there are two sites either side of the road. I had not booked but they helped me when I turned up and found me a slot on the smaller site. The space was tight to get in and it was difficult parking as I was on my own but the site was good, close to the beach with a short stroll into town."
24101,2536674,4,Pifolet,01/01/2023,"Camping with particularly new sanitary facilities, with heating and very hot water both in the shower and in the sinks. On December 29, without a reservation, they kindly put us in the only free space left, right next to the road and we could hear the cars quite a bit."
24101,2534720,5,m.freiwald,30/12/2022,"Came without a booking from December 24th to 27th, 2022 and were warmly welcomed. Beautiful parcelling. Sanitary facilities/washing area clean. V&E very good. Price-performance top. Price from 22€/night. Recommended for a longer stay. Location on the outskirts but still close to the beach. No disturbing noise. With mini market and small pizzeria."
24101,2531308,5,hugofonker,28/12/2022,Professional and accommodating welcome. Very clean sanitary.
24101,2523564,4,loakzebulot,18/12/2022,2022-12. open all year round campsite very very well located professional reception easy booking online clean facilities we could regret the small pitches we had a good time in safety at a fair price a small grocery store restaurant by the sea 200 meters away the town 20 minutes away on foot with all the temptations nb-calm atmosphere for seniors
24101,2522318,4,familieHommes,15/12/2022,Great place for a transit. Clean shower and handy: a Dutch girl behind the reception. Otherwise not very special. We were there with two small children in December and for children it is very boring (no play areas and almost only older visitors).
24101,2515922,5,Grand_Cali,08/12/2022,"Beautifully located place, very helpful, friendly and courteous staff. Here you stay longer than just passing through. I wanted to stay one night; it has become three and I will definitely come back here to stay longer."
24101,2510876,5,HeKl,02/12/2022,"Good location, friendly staff, all services you need and clean. Out of season good price. Should be tight on the pitch in the season. Now you could park relatively generously."
24101,2492873,5,david09350,12/11/2022,Very nice campsite and very friendly welcome! Access a little difficult for an 8m50 motorhome because many people during our visit and the large spaces already taken! Very very clean sanitary! thank you
24101,2486283,1,haul,07/11/2022,"very small pitches, you stand close to each other. That's why we don't go there anymore... Sanitary facilities are good, staff at the front desk are very friendly."

24101,2463047,3,Rodacar,26/10/2022,"Friendly welcome, industrial campsite, vehicles on top of each other, at the level of a service area, but at 35.- euros per night. Clean sanitary facilities, easily accessible services. Positive point, close to the beach and very nice promenade."
24101,2461527,5,SwantjePeinert,25/10/2022,"Great location, 50m to beautiful beach. Spaces are tight, but larger vehicles get 2 spaces. Very friendly and helpful. For roadside assistance, the phone calls were made for us in Spanish. We were there for 1 week in mid-October and made nice trips to Cadaques and Girona. Clean warm showers, the Ülatz is only recommended."
24101,2460285,1,Valentinkeusch,24/10/2022,"Very unkempt camping. As many mobile homes as possible, close together. We had a VW camper, hardly any space and this at the end of October. Paid full price, like giant RVs. Left immediately the next day, were on the road for seven weeks, lousy place, not recommended!"
24101,2455258,4,LosJubilados,21/10/2022,"Very well located campsite, with all amenities, impeccable toilets and showers and very quiet even at night. Only downside, small pitches, price a bit high, especially for the month of October. But I recommend."
24101,2412667,3,fbouquet,29/09/2022,large campsite but small spaces. 32€ one night on 29 09 2022 in a van for 2 people. expensive for the area.
24101,2396082,2,vict0r9,23/09/2022,Small campsite and they still admit more clients than they fit... very clean bathrooms although few for the amount of occupancy. Comfortable to be able to visit Roses.
24101,2380604,4,Maruwi,17/09/2022,"Clean and well equipped sanitary facilities. Are cleaned several times a day. Staff friendly and a bus with electricity and 2 people cost us 32 euros. The location of the campsite is very good, only 50 m from the beautiful sandy beach. Pretty well shaded. You'll be happy to come back there."
24101,2363983,1,jansa92,12/09/2022,"The few positives in advance: the place is in a good location. Unfortunately that was it. A toilet house now serves as a storage room. If you want to relax for a night, this is definitely the place for you, but compared to pretty much all other campsites in the vicinity, the site is actually extremely sandy, no lawn, very small, few toilets, sloping and especially massively overpriced."
24101,2286445,2,Txetxu,22/08/2022,"If you go with a van you have to pay the same price as a motorhome but they only give you half a plot because the other half is used to put a tent, I say plot not to say parking because the ground is sand / earth and without separation or marked plots . The location is ok, close to the beach"
24101,2263128,1,flowsnyder,18/08/2022,Very narrow pitches. With our 6.40m just about fit in one place. Extending the awning is impossible because the space is too small. Have booked for 2 nights but will continue after one night. 70 euros per night is too much for something like that. (2EW+2K) one star because of the good location to the beach.
24101,2217233,1,Faeh,11/08/2022,"We are not picky but this campsite is worse than an area. The pitches are not spacious on top of each other, you have to make multiple maneuvers to get in and out and the table fits right next to the motorhome. Very noisy until late at night. Only the proximity to the beach is positive."
24101,2216089,2,paafm,11/08/2022,"We have a CC of 7m50, we were placed along the toilets, wedged between the emptying of the chemical toilets and the garbage cans. Not to mention that all night long, you can enjoy the background music from the toilets which operates 24 hours a day and from the fairground next door. For 50 euros per day. value for money is to be avoided. The good location of the campsite does not excuse everything."
24101,2187216,3,pedro5,06/08/2022,"Pitches not very large and a bit crowded. On the other hand very good welcome and super well located (beach, shops, market ....) Very well equipped (supermarket swimming pool ...) Price in the average"
24101,2183413,2,johanBoisleve,06/08/2022,105€ for 2 nights and 3 days in a van without electricity...it's expensive all the same. the beach at 50 m is great. parked along the wall and too much traffic noise. more light from street lamps ... disappointed!

Unfortunately, the nights were a bit noisy, but otherwise everything is good here if you want to have a typical vacation spot flair. the pool is perfect when the sea doesn't play along. the bar on the beach is also great."
24101,2088503,5,adoppler,18/07/2022,"Great spot if you like it a little more touristy! Super clean sanitary facilities, neat place. Promenade can be reached in 5 minutes on foot, center about 15 minutes on foot, great way, especially in the evening. Pitch a bit tight, but still very quiet in the evening!"

Other side has less shade and is more like a car park but all facilities available to both sides. Supermarket with good bread, restaurant, very clean facilities. 2mins stroll to very large and pleasant beach and seafront. Town and harbour another 15 mins walk, really nice place"
