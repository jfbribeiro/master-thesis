105988,2174168,5,elgoibar81,04/08/2022,Outside the campsite motorhome washing service. The water comes out with a lot of pressure. Ideal to give a good shower to the motorhome. The site is behind a wall next to the main entrance of the campsite.
106009,2816294,5,lamardebien,03/06/2023,"Ideal place to spend the night. We have been all alone. There are nice views of the town if you go up the stairs of the convent. There is a fountain with drinking water. The terrain is irregular although if you are alone and you can choose, there is a top and 0 inclined site!"
106009,2683079,4,rubio_minina,20/04/2023,"Good space, somewhat inclined, perfect if you don't like the crowds of ""massified tourist towns"" and perfect for visiting the surroundings of Horta de Sant Joan."
106009,2189536,4,magatoro,07/08/2022,"Quiet place, with an esplanade to spend the night. If you park strategically you can get shade from the trees. The convent is very beautiful??"
106009,1765593,5,Fredpsq,25/02/2022,"We parked in the 2nd parking lot next to the convent for our lunch break. Very nice place, very nice view. We did not sleep there. The dirt parking lot is a little bumpy but it passes easily."
106009,1605828,5,xondi,25/09/2021,"The best thing is to go up to the convent and park in front, it is worth getting lost among the pines and enjoying the building illuminated at night. The ground is dirt and is somewhat uneven, but there is some level point. Nice views of Horta from the front of the convent. There is also a fountain. If you are looking for solitude and peace in the middle of nature, this enclave is ideal. 4G only from Movistar."
106053,1029751,3,irenescuter,06/09/2020,"Room for a single vehicle and not very large. Quiet and shady. A bit dirty, with excrement and papers ... a pity"
106067,1749161,4,perenquen2019,06/02/2022,"It is the ""Els Salats"" airfield. Space of historical memory. We have been for lunch. Very quiet place."
106067,704906,1,Patmano,26/09/2019,"Impossible to find it in the middle of the night through the fields, isolated from everything, very risky to spend the night, other parking but circus installed, take the road towards Tarega, very late"
106098,2073222,1,Anitaniet,14/07/2022,"in photo it is not the same as reality, little space and many flies"
106103,3051515,3,volfrog,31/07/2023,"Rest area type site wedged between two arms of the road. With a roof tent, this site was still much better for sleeping than the Motorhome area located in Arguedas. Under the pines, the place was not so dirty as described in other reviews. The water tap was turned off during our visit. In short, apart from the not so bad road noise, I still recommend the site."
106103,1937499,1,yjanin,01/06/2022,"Dirty place, not at all flat and a few meters from the road."
106103,1629634,3,JosselinLacroix,06/10/2021,Nice site with a practical water point but a lot of waste on the ground (toilet paper in particular) and a lot of flies during our stay making it a little unpleasant!
106103,1054057,2,MonicaPimientos,17/09/2020,"One of the few places in the area where you can find water, although it is not drinkable. We take the opportunity to wash and shower. It does not have any other services, it is not a pretty place but it is functional."
106103,721651,4,sukee44,14/10/2019,"Close to a road but little passage in the evening. Non-drinking water, trash, no toilet Unfortunately trash on the ground ..."
106103,594321,4,hama01,03/08/2019,We spent the evening and one night. shady place water point a little car pass in the morning but not too disturbing. 10mns away from Bardenas Reales.
106103,535053,3,LRcompetition,01/07/2019,"Perfect with shade, unsafe water and trash cans. Too bad some do not know what the trash is for, it looks like a dump on the ground"
106103,512899,5,clem64,12/06/2019,Perfect place. For the night a little passage. But calm
106103,487604,3,Alexvroni,19/05/2019,The place is not bad for one night.
106119,408870,2,pozdrozoVanie,20/11/2018,Only for 4x4.
106166,2880545,4,AnnaPhilip,22/06/2023,"Very nice bay with restaurant and showers on the beach. Very idilic. You are not allowed to spend the night here, but you can stay at a P 100m away. When you drive up from the bay > left and 1st right. Nice flat place."
106166,2547653,4,345id,09/01/2023,"The spot is very nice, no service, the parking is slightly pending, we are in January and it is not bad"

106167,3159363,4,klimka,16/08/2023,"relaxed standing right in front of the beach. Very noisy at night due to the cars driving by and the cobblestone streets. come early otherwise it will be full. Good breakfast, brunch can also be shared for two right on the beach, Bar Lais de Gui A"""

106167,2521318,1,bigorangeontheroad,14/12/2022,I’m few hours parked someone robed my van. Be careful.
106167,2484325,1,parkfornightsully,05/11/2022,"Good place to park if you are going to the beach, however, be very careful. Our van was broken into. Someone forced the window down and unlocked it all from the inside. They stole all of our valuables and some coats. I don’t wish it on anyone so be careful."
106167,2432734,3,shira2022,09/10/2022,"Parking on the avenue, the night has been quite noisy, a very busy area, perfect for eating and walking. no services"
106167,2347122,5,volkerrollt,07/09/2022,"Parking right on the beach promenade. Beach showers and toilets, even warm showers for 1€ until 8pm. All you need!"
106167,1863407,2,NataliayTono,01/05/2022,"The only good thing is that you are next to the beach, forget about sleeping here because cars, motorcycles, trucks ... all night long pass by your side. Also, as the road is cobbled, they make even more noise."
106167,1055877,4,aitpic,18/09/2020,"Parking on avenue. The night has been quite noisy from garbage trucks, cars passing and at 7 in the morning noise with lawnmowers. It has no services. Still with good views."
106167,415097,1,herru,20/12/2018,Not nice. Parking bag directly on busy street.
106177,3269689,4,forajidoooooo,07/09/2023,"I slept alone last night, very quiet... people come to visit, but when it gets dark you stay alone... it's okay"

106177,1759789,3,elmarmon,19/02/2022,"Parking to visit the Lagoons. We spent the night together with another van, super calm. No services, not even a rubbish bin, in some areas there is a difference in level but it can be solved with wedges. The access road is good."
106196,3244721,5,Inmapa,01/09/2023,"Free area with water service and free emptying, picnic tables and trash. The area is spectacular, very well-kept delimited plots, very quiet. We spent the night there and we were alone and totally recommended. A wonder to take care of. Many thanks to the people of Pobo!!"

106196,2972864,5,Judiaantje,16/07/2023,Magical place for peace seekers. Lots of wind and cooler. Also fun for children: mini 'safari park' with a story about the history of this area (Un safari en la sabana del Turoliense Dinoexperience).
106196,2901606,5,Cagasanju,28/06/2023,"Charming, quiet and pleasant place. Beautiful views."

106196,2652814,5,dancyngman,09/04/2023,"Very good area to rest and spend the night. Great with children, animal figures. Water, gray and black. They have planted trees but it is very new and they are still small. Let's keep these kinds of sites as we found them. Thank you for thinking about this type of tourism."
106196,2625921,5,Manuelizquierdo,26/03/2023,"Thanks to the Pobo for this area. Large pitches and filling and emptying service, good views."
106196,2611354,4,leptitjp,16/03/2023,"The most original area borrowed to date. We are at an altitude of 1400m facing a breathtaking view! And the safari animals intrigued our dog! Access from Teruel is a bit tight for our 8.50, but the U-turn was easy to do before the village, for better access. The plots are of good size. The emptying is accessible to large motorhomes. On the other hand no water this day… To know before doing all these kms! We do not regret. We had a very good lunch at the El pobo restaurant; Very kind. We slept very well! Thank you community!"
106196,2571123,5,SimonSarahSumo,07/02/2023,"Great place to stop and stay, water off due to the cold weather but easy to open the manhole to turn it back on. Very quiet. Very clean services also. Nothing in town apart from the bar nearby. Great views all around and hilarious safari park next door.
Thank you El Pobo!"
106196,2471273,5,feva33,30/10/2022,"Quiet and clean place! It has Free emptying and water. Perfect for resting and walking, spectacular views. The only bad thing about the place is that the town has no service, there is a ""bar"" that is supposed to have a store but it is closed, a recreational area closed, bread three days a week and on request... So the area is perfect and the safari is a hoot"
106196,2438629,5,markparis,12/10/2022,perfect and super quiet. slightly away from the village. very clean
106196,2363129,5,JavierHamzaSC,11/09/2022,"Perfect place to rest, we spent a beautiful night under the light of the full moon, we were two motorhomes, it was super cool. And what I liked the most was the service for filling up the water and emptying the gray water and emptying the poti, and it was free, thanks for a magnificent place with a spectacular safari landscape."
106196,2303486,5,GarciaT4,26/08/2022,"Quiet and beautiful place. We slept one night in August and the truth is that we slept well and cool, the place is very well leveled and clean. Thanks to the city council and the neighbors for having these areas so well cared for."
106196,2226328,5,Lucia4you,13/08/2022,"very quiet and cool place, so much so that we had to cover ourselves with a duvet, ideal to escape the summer. We stayed in a motorhome for one night and it was perfect, you can visit the town in a 5-minute walk."
106196,2125076,5,josemva,26/07/2022,"Nice motorhome area, in a beautiful landscape. Very quiet to spend the night. When the trees are a little bigger they will give more shade. It is on the outskirts of town. The town is very beautiful and its people are very friendly. There is a park with small and slightly older swings. They have sports courts, including a fronton, to play soccer, basketball and table tennis."
106196,1889254,5,Enolasoni,14/05/2022,beautiful and very quiet area you have a mini safari of prehistoric animals. and the town next door there is a restaurant bar that eats very well abundant and well priced. the townspeople very friendly and helpful. Great thanks to the town council for thinking of us motorhome drivers.
106196,1885530,5,Stratters,12/05/2022,Close enough to Teruel - but peacefully located in wide open countryside. Village is lovely -  very friendly folk in the bar/ restaurant just 2 mins walk away. Stan the dog has enjoyed a runaround and there’s lots of space and an animal safari for young kids. So peaceful - I might stay an extra night!
106196,1868854,5,CovadongaG,03/05/2022,"Very quiet place, ideal to go with children. Paleontological routes nearby. A very cool area."
106196,1828461,4,DavidBP81,16/04/2022,"Advantages: - Easy access - Correct services - Very quiet area, with good views Disadvantages: - If you are looking for hiking trails, you should go to other areas - If you go to areas with pine forests, there is a lot of plague of Processionary Caterpillar (dangerous for children and dogs)"
106196,1824053,5,kekov12,15/04/2022,A perfect area to be quiet and with children.
106196,1821016,5,GPSLM,14/04/2022,Great area next to the town. All services and safari park for the family. Sports courts and swings in the town. Perfect
106196,1817396,4,balderj,12/04/2022,"Quietly located CP with panoramic views, you can indeed drink a nice beer in the local restaurant, the serrano ham and patates bravas are also delicious and that for a reasonable price."

106196,1766741,5,KaWa60,26/02/2022,Everything new and lovingly made. Very quiet and pure nature. Thank you to the community! Good 4G reception.
106196,1758676,5,daniguillem,17/02/2022,"The place is amazing, the town and its charming people, you have hiking trails, they have a bar, they have a shop. You have to ask the town hall bailiff to solve the water issue. In winter they close the water due to frost. I had two great days."
106196,1723715,4,vicsmacs,02/01/2022,"The place is incredible, new, next to some dinosaurs that kids love and away from the small town. The only thing is that when we came there WAS NO WATER!"
106196,1710165,5,sanyufunky,14/12/2021,"Nice, free and well-kept area. Behind the parking space a small exhibition with plastic animals was created. The area is very nice. Water was on December 15th. already turned off. Disposal of toilet and waste water is still possible. El Pobo is dead at this time of year. We only saw a small bar that was open. No shopping at this time of year."
106196,1672533,5,Yugular,01/11/2021,"Beautiful AC area surrounded by nature on the outskirts of town. Soil with grass and plots with trees that when they grow a little more, will give good shade. You can walk to town and there is a bar with a shop very close. Totally recommended place. Thanks to El Pobo for their hospitality."
106196,1671090,5,NomadasCharlatanes,31/10/2021,We had a great night !!! Quiet and without any hassle. It has all the free services and next to it a small exhibition of Teruel's prehistoric animals. The town just 5 minutes walk. Super recommended
106196,1615010,5,andreamase,28/09/2021,"Well done parking, loading and unloading area. the stalls are very large, the plants have yet to grow, so little shade for the moment. congratulations to the municipality that offers an excellent free stopping point."
106196,1577014,5,Birdycamper,14/09/2021,If you need peace and quiet this spot is perfect. The services are very clean. We spent a night alone away from overcrowded motorhome areas.
106196,1512467,5,kykeva,25/08/2021,Area of 10 !!! Landscaped plots with all free services! It has a life-size figured animal park for children. Behind a huge space for dogs to run. The town is worth visiting! Thanks Pobo
106196,1477796,5,IsabelleM64,18/08/2021,"Very nice area with a nice animal park, incredible to find this animation thank you to the town hall of this welcoming village! Thanks again !"

106196,1209389,4,Fredyzaragoza,21/05/2021,"Functional area, there is water (tap on the right for the WC) drained of gray and black (in the casket that is ON THE RIGHT of the taps) The town as such has almost nothing, but it is an opportunity to spend a day and night relaxing, taking a walk. The bread is ordered in the only bar in town."
106196,1189071,5,Isjamarael,08/05/2021,"Zone 10, with all services and very cozy, next to the town but isolated at the same time. Ideal to stop with children. They have managed to make a place with a lot of charm. Thanks to the people of Pobo !!!"
106196,1133749,4,viajandoconpakita,29/01/2021,Good place and very quiet with beautiful views
106196,1115340,5,VanHobo,15/11/2020,"Lovely place, near a road but hardly any traffic, very peaceful, locals very friendly. Fresh water, grey and black empty points. Thank you to the community for providing such a great stopover."
106196,1074568,5,Nancywilly,29/09/2020,"Congratulations to the municipality. What a beautiful place. Fantastic view over the region. Service area, everything available. 8 beautiful spacious pitches. Village small. No shop or bar. Also well laid out garden by the municipality with benches for picnics. Top"
106196,703699,3,Patmano,25/09/2019,"Small quiet stop that helps, but lack of maintenance, review the evacuation of black water, thank you to the municipality"
106196,447672,5,koppa35,01/04/2019,Very quiet place The area is fine although it still lacks some detail. Best of all the people of the town who helped me with a small problem with the motorhome. Thank you very much and I will be back for the festival.
106196,418440,5,gordicar,31/12/2018,"There is even water to flood the entire town. Is it too bad to go to the tracks? It is a mountain road and depending on where you come from there are more or less curves, it is what the mountain and the villages of the place have. The area is in a very quiet place and away from the madding crowd, do not expect shopping centers"
106196,417119,1,CRICRIG,28/12/2018,"Without water. We made many kilometers to load water, but there was no water. The area is very bad if you want to go to the Valdelinares ski resort. There are hardly any sites for loading and unloading"
106206,2736079,3,Roel964,09/05/2023,"It is better to continue till you reach the official parking. In this way you do not block access for farmers and from the official parking a walking path takes you to many nice stone houses. Distance from the main road is 1,9 km to the parking."
106206,1199704,5,fizzghigg,15/05/2021,"Small, very pleasant shaded car park at the end of the road, at the start of the ""Ruta de la capona"" walk. Quiet for a night or two, in order to quietly discover this corner which is worth the detour. Magnificent place. Lots of walks to do, lots of dry stone huts to discover."
106206,496515,4,nthEsme,30/05/2019,"Stayed the night at a small pullin, although was uncomfortable not being sure if I’d pulled into someone’s place. A bit further down the road is a marked parking place suitable for several vehicles. About 3 km in and clearly signed. If you can make the road a larger vehicle could easily park here. Would recommend this over the places you can pull in since it’s a proper car park. Still no houses in sight.  Short walk back to several stone houses, although quite a lot of rubbish in them."
106215,3160599,4,sam0907,16/08/2023,nice place ... on the edge of the douro outdoor shower and toilet available ... small flat a lot of traffic for a remote place ...
106215,3155940,5,Kugamper,15/08/2023,"Good place to sleep. It has public bathrooms, a fountain and two showers; one in the soccer field and another in the bathrooms. Sometimes the cars pass too fast and too close, be careful with that when going around the vehicle. In the morning there is a lot of movement, it seems safe to leave it alone. Less than €6 in Uber to the center. At night it stays quiet, we were able to sleep well."
106215,2949157,2,mymy34,11/07/2023,"Very nice place by the river with picnic table, toilet and shower (closed at 7 p.m.). But on the other hand there are many worlds until late. We stayed there to eat in the evening but not to sleep, young people had fun going back and forth on the road at full speed. Great for spending the day there!"
106215,2276047,4,tarnaud,20/08/2022,Quiet car park with the necessary amenities (the toilets are closed at night)
106215,2241370,3,caujajsemany,15/08/2022,Local young people use the place for evening drinking and partying. Good for one night but nothing nice.
106215,2061237,4,seglion,11/07/2022,"Cobblestone parking next to the river beach, we spent one night, there was a caravan and a motorhome installed. Noise when passing cars. the beach toilets are closed at night"
106215,1893633,5,CrisN,16/05/2022,"To spend the night well, very quiet, a car passes from time to time. It is only parking, there are no services."
106215,1866910,4,EduardoCorreia,02/05/2022,"great place, close to the river, good beach! to windy on the day i sleep there...but very calm and quiet, just some kids smoking and eating junk but not noisy or bad company.

no services, but close to a bar with the basics."
106215,1856859,5,abis_2,27/04/2022,We had a good night sleep without any trouble. Wonderful views on Porto. Nice beach with good access to the water. Lovely local bar close by. Recommended
106215,1854960,4,EllaStar,26/04/2022,"We enjoyed the beautiful view, you can hike or cycle along the water to the old town! The charming café ""A Casinha D'Avintes"" is right next door and offers delicious snacks and beers as well as cocktails on its terrace overlooking the water. The owners are very nice and have good tips for the area. We'd love to come back!!!"
106215,799133,1,dodgeram1,18/04/2020,Young people deliver car races at night. Enjoy your stay !!!
106215,663799,3,Capcoast64121,28/08/2019,Place along a dead end road ok to troubleshoot but not more
106215,613854,2,dedeep,09/08/2019,"Nice location right on the river. BBQ areas and water available. But: Half the village runs here in the evening up and down, everything seems fresh: bike path and running track. Although remote, many drive here in the evenings and thunder along the cobblestones."
106263,1749054,3,MissSchwertfisch,06/02/2022,"On a Sunday in February there is a lot of traffic, everything is parked. People picnic here. The toilets are not clean, a shower spits out hot water with a lot of noise. Everything is getting old. I don't like the place as a pitch: there is no real view of the valley and on the other side the mountain blocks the sun, which in winter disappears behind it at 2 p.m."
106263,1656883,5,cirquedusole,22/10/2021,"October 22nd, 3pm, still working!! beautiful hot shower. didn't spend the night."
106263,1113144,4,Thenudrovers,07/11/2020,Strange place.  Lots of roadside parking on the cobble stones but very difficult to get a level.  Nearby sensory park worth a look.  Satnav initially wanted to send us on a really stupid route through the forest on a track.  Stick to the main road and pick up signs in the village.
106263,958652,5,AnaPaulaCostaSilva,13/08/2020,"We were unable to stay overnight, with pity on us. We encountered a malfunction that forced us to start our return journey a day earlier. We had lunch at the Piadussa restaurant and enjoyed it a lot. I recommend"

106305,3027445,4,YerayChinea,27/07/2023,"It is a very nice place to sleep and rest. But keep in mind that it is a recreational fishing site and you should not park next to the water in this site. At 8am the fishermen begin to arrive, even a huge truck came to load water from the lake."

106305,2916805,4,Tobi21,02/07/2023,"Overall, the place reminds a bit of Sweden. Nice place, but some garbage. Fishermen come both in the evening and in the morning, who eye you a little critically. Great for one night especially if you want to visit Obidos - which should be a must!"
106305,2870509,5,ellieandwillt,19/06/2023,"Lovely and quiet spot to spend the night! There were fishermen when we arrived but after they left we had the place to ourselves. It’s flat and there is god mobile signal. Great place to stay before visiting Óbidos the next day (we drove and parked in the free parking in town). To get to this parking spot, you have to drive down and uneven gravel road."

Unfortunately, the pleasure is quickly diminished when we gravitate around the spot. It's littered with all kinds of papers. Doing your business in nature is one thing, but leaving your papers is another. Think of those who pass after you and nature please. PRESERVE OUR SPOTS."

It is perfect because it has everything you want: great view, water, calm, isolated, easy path to access it and at the same time very close to the magnificent city of Obidos. It is only 20 minutes walk from the spot so perfect for a stroll. Really perfect spot!"

Seen directly on a eucalyptus forest and on the water reservoir of the dam which seems very full of fish. Fishing is regulated here. The surroundings are unfortunately a little dirty with used tissues
106305,1624568,5,PatriceL,03/10/2021,Super nice place ... With our big integral we settled next to the dam. A bit noisy with the freeway in the distance but it's reasonable.

106309,440259,1,MassComedia,16/03/2019,Uncommon place to sleep. About 11 of the nights a lot of car traffic. There are several prostitutes in the parking lot. In the end we changed our site.

106313,2710406,1,soapyf,30/04/2023,Would not recommend. We found dog excrement all over the parking lot which looked like it had been thrown over from the house above. Dirty and a general uneasy feel.
106313,2578754,4,celenotaygete,15/02/2023,"Just a dirty parking lot next to a dry river bed, but ideal for discovering this town. Not touristy, although beautiful to walk around here.

Locals drove over the beach with spinning tires, later when I was already asleep someone drove past me honking their horn. Coincidence or undesirable ?!"
106353,1700313,1,CasitaNL,29/11/2021,"This spot is not at all what the photos say. It is just a small gravel parking for locals to visit the little lake. If we put our campers here, the locals have no place to park. Doesn’t feel right."

A little unsettling. Be double sure your doors are locked."

There is rubbish in the back area and there is an unpleasant smell of empty chemical toilets and the contents of gray water. You can see the bright tracks of the empty gray water tanks all over the back area. The beach with its bars are beautiful. We were there one night. We wouldn't come back."

Even in December this is a must ;) Too bad the toilets are not open. It is a dirty place there, but if you are on the other side you will not be bothered by it. Little passage and lots of space on the beach! Water shoes are useful."
106400,2498353,5,vanandco,17/11/2022,Really beautiful and tranquil spot. The sunset was amazing. During the off-season your dog can run free with no problem. Fisherman come during the evening. It was really a perfect night spent there.
106400,2317184,1,Samer19,29/08/2022,"The location does not match the photos of the publication. The parking in the photos is one that is close, next to the beach bar. The one in the location is like a dog beach, a bit dirty and in which there are people installed, it seems that it is permanent. Still we had a quiet night."
106400,2048518,1,GodinoCamper,08/07/2022,"A public parking converted into a summer camp. If you like tranquility, you will not find it here. Transit all day and night between tourists and fishermen. Without services, only a few containers overflowing with garbage since the garbage truck does not pass by there frequently. And there are some that seem to be theirs... they reserve a place even for their brother-in-law who is on his way, seeing is believing"

At the end of the one-way road there is a large esplanade where we found several motorhomes. The police came in the morning but did not say anything. There are quite a few people with their dogs-they don't bother. The most delicate, the return-there is a little slope and it is a continuous line. There are only containers for organic waste."

106400,1853714,4,LaLore,26/04/2022,"Ideal place if you want to sleep ""on the beach"" listening to the sea. The beach is not sandy, but small stones and shells, so I recommend appropriate footwear. Very clean water. A few meters to the left there are nice beach bars. We ate surprisingly well in the only one that is open all year round. It does not have any service."
106400,1823264,4,santorres,15/04/2022,"Incredible views, there are many vans and perretes, the only drawback is that there are many fishermen and it is a bit dirty. there are garbage cans and it is hardly inclined"
106400,1815159,5,GuillePatry,11/04/2022,"Perfect place to unwind on the beach! Not many campers or ACs fit, but if you find a spot you can enjoy the beach directly from your van. Several people have not assured that there are no problems with staying overnight here. And also, luckily for us, the weather is on our side! We will be back without a doubt ☺️"
106400,1814987,4,JaiSan,11/04/2022,We have slept one night here and it has been perfect. The rest of the vans have been respectful and the night has been calm. We have slept with the sound of the sea. Please note that there are many dogs both in the parking lot and on the beach.
106400,1813512,4,Bakuninn,10/04/2022,"Unlike in other comments, our night there wasn't problematic at all, views directly from the sea were amazing, you can just dinner in the beach 5 meters away from your van and take a walk. Waking up in here was also amazing. No facilities, that's why I don't rate it with 5 stars."
106400,1797873,1,naiaman,27/03/2022,5 squatting vans with large untethered dogs attacking the vehicle when driving here. The person did not call them back or even lift them. We are leaving again. Nice place otherwise!

106400,1622978,1,g1nga_uk,02/10/2021,"Great location, spoiled by selfish people. we arrived around 7pm, full of campers, no space to park. many campers are there long term with awnings out, one even had a music system outside the van, a full stereo with separate speakers playing loud music.

The vans were so close together the awnings were almost touching the next van. If there's not enough room, just move on it gives us a bad name"
106400,1572707,2,Pepagoga,12/09/2021,"We couldn't get there. Access is through a lane that leaves the main road, you hardly see the entrance, and you pass it without realizing it. We went around a lot because there were also no roundabouts or changes of direction nearby. And when we were finally able to enter the lane did not give us a good thorn due to the weight of the vehicle and the difficulty in turning. So we went somewhere else."
106400,1562193,4,merrycloe,09/09/2021,"Small area next to the beach. It is accessed by a road that only fits a vehicle next to a riverbed. Don't worry, we're not going to sleep, but it seems like a good place. Further on there is a large dirt parking lot and showers. At this time we have been with the dog on the beach without problem."
106400,1505971,4,jotabarros,24/08/2021,"We arrived at night (11:30 pm) and there was plenty of room, it is a huge esplanade next to the beach, with showers that work all day. After a while there were some cars with people making a bottle and noise but you can always move a little and get away. We slept through it because you could hear the sea above all. Recommended if you are not neurotic with noise."

106400,1346783,4,mjcuenca,21/07/2021,"Parking on the beach, ideal for spending the night, 6, 7 vans fit well. Keep in mind that cars come to bathe from 11 am and that there are fishermen at night (they respect rest). The access and exit path is the same, and there is only room for one vehicle so if a car comes face to face you will laugh a bit. Garbage containers in the parking lot."
106400,1332748,4,audehas,17/07/2021,"Quiet place, flat parking, very practical beach shower, dog-friendly beach so all dogs are free. Clean rock / black sand beach. Garbage in the parking lot so no excuse, let's keep this place clean! The police came by around 11am, just to see if everything was okay, but didn't say anything, yet there were tables / chairs for exits."
106400,1280465,3,Sonyac,27/06/2021,"Generally quiet place with space for 7/8 vans or motorhomes. There are containers that were emptied early in the morning.

Some people complain about the noise from the trucks. The truth is that they are heard but we slept wonderfully. I imagine that it will depend on the sensitivity of each one in terms of noise. What does seem to me is a safe place and you can walk to the town"

106496,1960284,4,javeasteve5,08/06/2022,"Stayed 5 nights.  Very busy at Weekend, Peaceful after that. Toilets impeccable during week. Reception staff good English and helpful. Some plots you need 30m electric cable. Looks full of residents but mainly static for weekend."
106496,1808957,5,oscar881,07/04/2022,"Camping surrounded by nature, the bar that has some great sandwiches, the bathrooms of the campsite are small but they do their job, there is a barbecue area, a small children's area without many options for the little ones, it has a swimming pool, and a football-basketball field. It does not have water in the plots, nor drainage, but it does have various water intake points."
106496,1715988,5,vcuevas,26/12/2021,"Excellent camping between forests and mountains. Friendly treatment, clean advice, store with what you need. Absolutely recommended for hiking and biking."

Shop, swimming pool, volleyball and basketball field, playground, etc. Neat not so spacious sanitary buildings. Nice shower. Bread to order. Quiet location. Not applicable to all of us in November. In the week now 10 guests. Here for walking and cycling. Nothing close by."

Also great trails for mountain biking. Sensationally quiet area. Large, very well-kept place. We cannot understand the maximum height of 3 meters, possibly because of the trees. Length from our point of view max. 7.5 m."
106496,1182208,2,Flohmaus,30/04/2021,This campsite is not for people who want privacy and a little flair. Extremely many long-term campers with rather unsightly facilities. The spaces are not separated and you stand next to each other like on the cheap pitch. The beautiful swimming pool and the location right on the hiking trail may outweigh this for some ...? We are further on the 2 km away parking space with a wonderful flair.
106496,1170018,5,Amirae,07/04/2021,"We traveled with a van and we needed a place to camp. They took great care of us even though it was late, € 20 a night with Wi-Fi open at the campsite, or at least we were able to connect without problems. Clean facilities and camping area and another for rent. A beautiful setting"
106496,761081,2,angelbcn,31/12/2019,We were looking for a quiet place and we found what we never saw in a campsite: some customers riding a party in the middle of the campsite with music machine and professional sound equipment. And those responsible for camping unable to make them stop. On the other hand there is no mobile coverage except Movistar. They sold us a Wi-Fi access for 5 Euros per device to connect ensuring that it worked throughout the campsite without problems but it was not so and the connection is difficult and cut a lot. There is no height limit at the entrance

This is the second time I've parked for the day. there is a fountain and a garbage container. a neighbor told me: ""some neighbors"" call the police and fine them for encroaching on the road... (I think it is more of a deterrent) if you park properly, the road will not be encroached on. You must park well, because the site is small"

106502,2070298,5,rachaelmharri,14/07/2022,Great place to get some shade on a very hot summer day.  We parked parallel to the road under the trees and weren't disturbed all night.  Only noise was fire engines whizzing past with sirens on as it's very close to fire station.  Would stay again.

I did not sleep there because it is simply a perpendicular alley so not very beautiful or calm but it was perfect for the day to fill up with water and go for a hike to the palace."
106502,1931875,5,parkermav,30/05/2022,"We parked here to get to the center. There is room for one and two vans at the most, but certainly for more cars. Reaching the center is really simple and comfortable"
106502,1856442,5,lou0ntour,27/04/2022,I didn't stay the night here but would recommend it without a doubt. It's quiet and the water works. You can walk to the old town in 20-30 minutes.

106502,727445,3,LMCdaSilva,22/10/2019,"The place is safe but it is dimly lit. Following the main street you can spend the night in front of the fire department, next to the school, or in the cemetery park, a place marked on park4night. The paid park area has increased, so the space during the day during the school period is full. They can park large ACs along the street.

But we were tired and decided to stay, we spent a quiet night, without noise, and we woke up rested to visit the wonderful Sintra. The center is close and the bus stops (434) to visit the most designated places too. So it was a success to choose this site. Nothing advisable to wander around Sintra with AC, since the streets are full of traffic and are narrow. Also arriving at the center we find signs of PROHIBITED AC, although we have seen some circulate, we do not take risks. Good place to stop and spend a night. Without services"

106583,701734,4,torymartyn,23/09/2019,Parking with shade throughout the day thanks to the fact that it is surrounded by trees. Supermarkets nearby.

106583,458242,4,memeloo,18/04/2019,"Parquing inside the city of Olot. Quiet. We spent two nights without a problem. The Carrilet passes about 250 meters, perfect to make route. No sevicios but gas station, bakery and super next door."
106583,431558,5,valjeanpuce,20/02/2019,"Very good location, 3 places for buses or large camper with trailer, close to the center and walking or cycling"
106583,412400,5,marcpu,07/12/2018,Very close to the center. Near a super large and petrol station. We sleep without problems
106584,3208114,4,Nadlingo,23/08/2023,"Not far to walk into town. Public toilets nearby, but these close in the evening. Shopping center in direct reach."

106591,2638679,4,JesusCa,04/04/2023,"After going around many other nearby sites, this was the one that seemed best to us. It is quiet and it is very good for a windy day (as it happened to us). EYE!! There are two entrances, if you do not have a 4x4 it is better to take the one that is close to Sintra."
106591,2211098,4,Bushtrece,10/08/2022,Very quiet and secluded site. We stop to eat and continue on our way. It's small but nice
106591,1734715,5,daandj,15/01/2022,"Quiet shady space, felt extremely safe. Behind a house with a nice family. Close to the main road with Aldi. Recommended! 01/22"
106591,1392316,2,pollovegano,01/08/2021,"I arrived at 2 in the morning and spent the night without problem, yes the place is very dirty, full of garbage everywhere and a lot of traffic of people in the morning, pedestrians and bicycles constantly pass from just before 9 in the morning , maybe because it was Saturday and during the week it is quieter. Also in my opinion it is not worth it, especially because of the amount of garbage"
106591,1057899,3,AlvarMaria,19/09/2020,"Very calm. If it rains, access can be difficult. Right behind there is a farm but there seemed to be no one"
106591,1023530,5,sincoordenadas,03/09/2020,"Quiet and secluded place on the outskirts of Sintra. Very dark and a bit scary, we slept 2 nights without any problem. Some lost car and farm workers. Not a single car at night."

106591,652042,3,Marius8,22/08/2019,"The spot is fine, fits the description. We arrived in the late afternoon and until 22:30 no worries. on the other hand, at 10:30 pm a military patrol came to ask us to leave (we were 3 vehicles) because it is a private property."
106591,639191,5,nadj,18/08/2019,"Night in peace and in the nature despite the proximity of the city, thank you for this rare spot! Little room however, it is better not to arrive too late."

106591,611468,5,Titx,09/08/2019,Quiet place. We spent the late afternoon and saw only 2 bikes and one person walking his dog. 2 vans joined us at dusk.
106591,604901,4,milami,06/08/2019,"Very calm spot but very coveted, it is necessary to arrive early to have a good place. Despite the many camping cars around we had two good nights without noise. Very close to Sintra."
106591,592688,3,Paret7,02/08/2019,"Perfect spot to troubleshoot if you planned to go to Sintra the next day. Little room, we were two vans and I think it's the maximum possible. Easy access."

106591,460637,4,wujiadong,20/04/2019,Easy enough to access. It was a bit muddy but it is fine. There was already a big van when we arrived but we had enough place to park ours. Not many people passing by (only cyclists). Good enough for a night!
106591,451556,2,wooodrow,09/04/2019,This is just a muddy passing point at the end of a road. Only two vehicles passed in the night. Fine for a late night stopover.
106591,441821,5,Vanlife.bl,19/03/2019,"We were eating there, relaxed and the family from the house next door very friendly. We do not stay to sleep but we must rest wonderfully. I recommend it and if you travel with animals it is great for you to enjoy long walks."

106591,411627,5,Tee.um.Vier,03/12/2018,"Very quiet. I met two dogs, a woman and two cyclists. Good for the night. Aldi is pretty close. For a visit to Sintra you have to drive in 5 minutes."
106591,400649,5,lo33950,28/10/2018,"With a 4x4, we continued on a dirt road and were able to shelter from the wind which was very violent that night. Quiet place, we hear a little road in the distance, but not really disturbing"

106608,3092225,4,dom79000,07/08/2023,"Near the stadium, very good for spending a night away from the crowded areas at this time. In the early morning we were 5 CC. Nice village. Pizza nearby. Personally we did not hear the highway."

106608,1875120,2,Calimero125,07/05/2022,"In this region where motorhomes are banned, we are happy to find such places. Certainly it's not very bucolic but it allowed us to spend a night outside the overpriced campsites to rest before going to Spain. A little noise from the trucks on the highway, but nothing unbearable. Pizza and bakery nearby."
106608,1740249,2,xavier85,24/01/2022,Effectively noisy at night with the highway and large vehicle passage in the morning

106608,1627546,4,Cipomon,05/10/2021,"Comfortable and quiet place, perfect for overnight en route. No services, because it is not AC enabled. Tables by the river, where a girl gathered at night, but without any problem."
106608,1526254,3,Jefftom,29/08/2021,After filming late at night all over the area we were happy to find this place. Parked near the glass container we hardly heard the noise of the road. Impeccable for an overnight stay.

106622,1022497,4,Su.susa,03/09/2020,"Close to the road, some shade and water. There passes a path that runs along the entire riverbank"

106622,510174,5,flo0964,10/06/2019,"Great place, water fountain, barbecue, small path and river at the same time. Be careful the path to access is between two companies and it is not indicated. Perfect for a small picnic."

The recreation area up the hill was closed, I guess it is quiet season.. but there was nevertheless a drinking water pump working up there. Lovely area to be treated with respect! The access is quite narrow and unsuitable for large motorhomes."

Water change station in perfect condition. Near the town, tracks for a walk, nearby there is a lagoon... the entire town of stone houses and a beautiful Castle. There is a bar-restaurant that you can reach on foot."
