96707,2494303,5,Lauram23,13/11/2022,"We slept on a Saturday and not a noise. A walk from the center of Cuenca, about 25 min. Definitely a quiet place, when we arrived there were 2 motorhomes. Space For several campers or motorhomes."
96707,2011675,5,Patruski,26/06/2022,"We slept on a very quiet Saturday night! During the week there is still more traffic through the institute, we don't know."
96707,1615893,4,Mariarizos,29/09/2021,"Good site, flat. If you go during the week, keep in mind that there is a school and IES. At 8 o'clock the children pass. And in the afternoons there are high school cars, if you wait, the vast majority leave. 26 min walk from the cathedral and the main square of the old town"
96707,1545100,5,Obornico,04/09/2021,We arrived at night and slept very peacefully. Other users also joined the group which gave us security. Quiet car-free street this time of year.
96707,1156239,3,KerstinSofia,23/03/2021,Quite full over cars when I arrived in the afternoon. I think the area is used as a commute parking. If you continue to drive a few hundred yards there is more space to park. I stayed for lunch and then went on the road again.
96707,1080076,5,YunuCC,03/10/2020,Very quiet to park and get to know Cuenca.
96709,3095879,5,barougier,07/08/2023,The kind of little corners of paradise where you feel lucky to be able to spend the night and grateful to those who informed you. Place to preserve at all costs.
96709,3094935,3,Canela.,07/08/2023,"In the photo it looks like an esplanade, but really it only fits a van. When we arrived the place was already occupied."
96709,2854690,5,FlorianeGr.,14/06/2023,"Great spot in the middle of nowhere, the view is splendid! Sandy path, a little uneven with a few crevasses but passable by van."
96709,2376949,5,Tiya_minuscule,16/09/2022,Superb quiet place with beautiful walks around! a lot of flies but they don't bite anymore ;)
96709,2208995,5,marquerjulie,10/08/2022,"Very nice spot accessible by a slightly steep 3 km path. On arrival: granite tables and barbecues, flat terrain in the middle of rocky passes. Only downside: the biting flies!"
96709,1746437,5,Julieriba,03/02/2022,"A wonderful place! We went there with our small motorhome, the road is sandy but it goes well. Little traffic, just a gentleman in a 4×4 who went to the church twice a day. It is on a hiking circuit that passes through the neighboring village, we did a walking tour of about 3 hours."
96709,1551126,5,AdiRapaport,05/09/2021,"Great, quiet, great view.  The road was not difficult although there is a mile ride on a dirt road"
96709,1096972,5,lorena_bulli,17/10/2020,Crazy spot. Incredible
96709,1032975,5,JenfiLolo,07/09/2020,"The spot is simply idyllic. Alone in the world tonight. Surrounded by rocky hills. You can do another km on the track and you will arrive towards the church. The place is much more isolated than this spot. Be careful to access the spot or the church, it is rather a hilly track. So rather made for vans or 4x4. No phone or 4 / 3G signal but a magnificent starry sky at night ... you have to choose !!"
96709,961712,5,kristus1337,14/08/2020,"Extraordinary spot in the mountains. Far from everything, no trash and plenty of spaces. Road bad in some places but drivable with van."
96710,3187771,5,ivanr1979,20/08/2023,"Peace and quiet, only the cows and birds can be heard. There are very good views, you get to see the sea. We went up from Trucios where Google Maps sent us. As of August 23, the last 8km are a gravel forest track with some slightly broken sections. Although we came up with a Volkswagen Sharan 4x4 with stock height and summer road wheels."
96710,2946644,5,Silvestrebcn,10/07/2023,Only for 4x4 Camper prepared. the track is not difficult but there are difficult areas only for offroad.
96736,3172490,5,luciysb,18/08/2023,"We spent a quiet night without anyone bothering us. At first we parked on the main street and at night seeing that it was quiet and without much movement, we came to the parking lot. You have the river next to you, the truth is that it sounds enough to sleep hahaha. The town was cute and we ate in a pub at night."
96736,2265419,4,CrisCabrera,19/08/2022,"without services, but next to a river. behind there is a playground with a drinking water fountain. We have slept here one night without problem."
96736,1808829,1,aurodys,06/04/2022,it's right in front of the apartments. I didn't like it and left after a little beer. its emergency repair.
96736,891697,5,evitasc1,23/07/2020,"Wonderful town, we have parked without problems, the swimming pools € 1 per person, and then the visit to the wolf's house recommended to see"

96747,2848440,3,ibeasko90,12/06/2023,"Gratuitous. Paved and level site. It has no shadows. Quiet place although somewhat noisy from early in the morning, since the road is stuck. To spend a couple of nights well."
96747,2181820,1,Alix64,05/08/2022,plenty of room for motorhomes. but so dirty! we left when we saw the rats in the trash. a real open-air recycling centre.
96747,1874933,3,pamuxa,07/05/2022,Good parking and easy access. Flat and quiet to spend the night. Some noise because it is close to the road. Good to visit Iurreta and Durango.
96800,3287105,5,OlafVito,12/09/2023,"Nice view and very quiet out of season. Only a handful of cars passed by. Trash cans available. Unfortunately, the dam was cordoned off and not accessible. Spent a quiet night here."
96800,1899277,2,AlbertoysuCamper,18/05/2022,"The area next to the dam is visited by young locals to hang out, especially on summer nights. Less than 500m down the track there is easy access to the water, and a little further on the asphalt ends and it becomes narrower, although with good views of the reservoir and with some off-level parking spaces."
96800,839528,4,Maggyulito,28/06/2020,"Very nice and quiet place, ideal to spend the night, only some local people pass by. Nice views and walk around the reservoir."
96800,652454,1,Marlieesss,23/08/2019,Place for walking or looking at the water. For us it did not seem suitable to spend the night. (abandoned waste)
96814,3202618,5,Adone93,23/08/2023,"Beautiful place, with plenty of space but no services, to visit the city of Porto. We went downtown walking along the river and returned by bus. We actually slept a few streets over."

96814,2792236,5,DavidBartolome,27/05/2023,"Very nice place, next to the beach with a great promenade for walking or playing sports, supermarkets nearby"
96814,2778906,4,Frigotork,23/05/2023,"We stopped for a walk and eat. Porto is somewhat remote and access from the highway is difficult and narrow, but it was worth it. It has some inclination"
96814,2777472,5,Robinwomo,22/05/2023,Good way to explore Porto by bike.
96814,2272302,1,josejlc74,20/08/2022,Hello everybody. It is forbidden to camp here. The Municipal Police were here and fined €120. Don't come here. Vacations can get more expensive. Fined according to Art. 85 a of the highway code
96814,2271333,1,craftervanfamily,20/08/2022,"Beautiful place with a view of the sea and 6km by bike in the city, great for cycling. Lots of other campers here, we felt very safe too. Unfortunately, we too were woken up this morning by 8 police officers, fined 120€ because it is probably forbidden to park here."
96814,2271225,1,ehiztari,20/08/2022,"Very idyllic place with lots of space. Nice sunset with many campers. In the morning police raid, 8 agents fining €120. Throwing the face we have got rid, attu ta pasa."
96814,2271154,1,Rocioycala86,20/08/2022,"we arrived on a trip and went straight there, it was full of vans and motorhomes, we trusted it because all the reviews were positive and people put it great, regarding sleeping. The police said good morning to us, in ALL OF PORTUGAL YOU CAN ONLY PARK IN PAID CAMPSITES (caravans and vans) anywhere else. so €120 he told us the joke, and you have to pay it on the spot"
96814,2265902,5,jpp66,19/08/2022,"super incredible spot I hope it will remain accessible this little corner of paradise, we left Saturday morning escaping the fine thanks to the kindness of other cc's it's a shame the place was respected by the cc's and we don't disturb anyone I think that some portuguese people don't like cc's."
96814,2264493,5,maisnil,18/08/2022,A top place to go to Porto. 20 mins by bike by cycle path and very little frequented road. People and a lot of passage but the sunset is magnificent with a breathtaking view of the sea. This is one of my best spots.
96814,2249668,5,fers23,16/08/2022,"We have slept two nights and great. Giant parking with motorhomes and vans. Views of the city and the beach of authentic luxury and von sunset! Also say that it looks like a place frequented by kids for music and a bottle, the first night was on a Sunday and in the background there were a couple of cars with music, etc. But the truth is that without problems sleeping. I would repeat without a doubt"
96814,2247341,5,MartialBrise,16/08/2022,"The bike path runs along the ocean and the Douro, to get to town is ideal. ""Bird"" scooters are available nearby; beware the price is quite high, if you do not take a daily pass. We rented without a package, it costs €0.20/minute, and the 6-7 km that separates us from ""Vila nova de gaia"" cost us €8! (By scooter...) But the experience was great!"
96814,2229689,5,ybernard,13/08/2022,"Incredible view of the ocean, very nice spot with beach below and a magnificent sunset. A bit crowded in August but that's normal at this time. Passage until 22h but nothing too disturbing. I highly recommend this if you are passing through Porto, a few km away."
96814,2227291,4,vanlifemaso,13/08/2022,This place is really nice bur a bit busy in august. View on the ocean is stunning.
96814,2207824,4,totoclem,10/08/2022,Superb view but too many people we were higher. The airport being next a bit noisy. Bike path to go to Porto. Beach down
96814,2206214,5,motorhomeChile,09/08/2022,"The entire sector near Lavanderos beach (below, above in several streets) was full of motorhomes and motorhomes. 100% safe, and beautiful views. 20 minutes from Porto, beach 1 minute. there is nothing extra, just garbage cans."
96814,2204390,5,LuceMarche,09/08/2022,"Perfect. Free, many motorhomes but places available with sea view. 20, 25min by bike from the center by bike path right next door."

96814,2201348,4,jdgraaf,09/08/2022,"Good place for spending the night before or after exploring Porto. Sufficient places and you’re not the only one on this spot, though it’s a relaxed. No services"

96814,2198534,4,Family4Road,08/08/2022,"A very nice place to stop near Porto, enjoy and sleep listening to the sea. You will feel protected as at least now in August there are 8-10 other motorhomes and vans. Bike path to get to the center. The only improvement, better public transport connection to the center and the fact that it has no services, it is a parking lot."
96814,2183979,5,josmadeleine,06/08/2022,"We spent 2 nights at this spot. Very pleasant, at the edge of the water. Porto is easy to reach by bus or by bike with a nice cycle path."
96814,2183145,5,PeterReichel,06/08/2022,"Maginficent view and quiet night.
Beach showers and open toilet a little further south at Praia de Lavadores.

Maybe this helps to keep the rocks at the bottom of the parking lot clean."
96814,2166782,5,FranReinoso,03/08/2022,"Perfect place to park and spend the day or night, there are always motorhomes so you will feel the security of being supported. Quiet place with excellent views of the sea. Highly recommended."

Small flat, alcoholic people parked next to us by car and prevented us from sleeping until 2 am. But the view is so beautiful..."
96814,2151429,4,loizonoir,31/07/2022,Small car park facing the sea and perfect for visiting Porto. The place is filled with vans in high season. A few mosquitoes but nothing very disturbing! I recommend for one night!
96814,2145529,4,willemrakhorst,30/07/2022,Beautiful location. View of nature (ocean) and city at the same time. Easy to get to Porto center by taxi or scooter. A bit restless at night with young people and fishermen.
96814,2135174,3,JLKiki,28/07/2022,"Magnificent location overlooking the sea and the city of Porto. On the other hand, we slept very badly because a lot of comings and goings of vehicles and young people laughing and talking loudly..."

Beautiful beach and beach breakwater on the left following the cycle path. We spent 2 nights. 1 night just after visiting Porto and the 2nd after playa and walking around the area"
96814,2042996,5,peppo540,06/07/2022,"This place is one of the best we've had so far! During the day its very busy, because everybody wants to get a parking lot, but in the evening there is a good chance to get one with the view of Porto and the ocean. In the evening/ night its most likely that younger people are coming by to ""party"" or to do karaoke in the car. For us it's not a reason to not stop here."
96814,2036983,3,Ajjj,04/07/2022,"It’s ok. A lot of passage, some drug dealing at night and besides the ocean there’s not much beauty. All the toilets where closed. Lovely restaurant Casa Branca at the boulevard. We stayed the night at the boulevard because it was more quiet."
96814,2010889,4,KayleighConway,26/06/2022,Stayed here for 3 nights the view is lovely definitely the highlight of this place! It is uneven so levellers are needed and there are cars moving throughout the day but worth it for the view and the sound of the waves at night !
96814,2007229,4,meumeu07,24/06/2022,"The +: Very nice view of a magnificent sunset. Flat paved ground. The -: many passages, no service available, many pedestrians and people sleeping in a small space."

96814,1951638,5,emmadmoiselle,06/06/2022,"This small car park located at the end of a dead end road offers us a wonderful view of the bay of Porto! Very calm, the only noise that can disturb your experience is the gentle song of the ocean on the rocks."

96814,1847923,4,Leonhymer,23/04/2022,Good night with the sound of the waves even if frequented in the evening by locals and not level. Beware of salt also for those who have corrosion or rust problems.

96814,1758726,4,MarkenRuth,17/02/2022,"Very nice place with direct view of the Atlantic Ocean. Very busy with many day visitors and with the many worse reviews (about burglaries, etc.) we were there while we were there ourselves (including an overnight stay), but for a visit to Porto we looked for a campsite with security..."

96814,1683452,5,isabellaoh,09/11/2021,"Incredible place! We stayed for 3 nights, the police came by one morning but said nothing. Feels safe as we were 6 vans (in November). The view is amazing as you can see both the ocean and Porto. Walking to the center is about 7 km but is definitely doable if you got the whole day, we walked to and from the city one day and took the bus the other day, it’s 2€ per person and takes about 25 minutes."

96814,1552726,5,NeoSheep,06/09/2021,Perfect place to stay and explore Porto. Uber into the city is 7€. Best if you bring your own toilet. The next public toilet is 10 min walk away down the road.
96814,1503119,4,valparking77,23/08/2021,"Nice place, near the beach, nice view. A lot of people passing so no worries about you car if you are going in the city, on the other end the spot is no very private. For 1/2 nights and sightseeing definitely good!"
96814,1489546,3,CharlinPati,20/08/2021,Very safe space to leave the motorhome as there are always a lot of people around the space. So you can perfectly explore the city without fear of someone breaking into your vehicle. With the Uber for just under € 5 you drove to the city center and had a great day. You can also stay here overnight. There are always campers here and perfectly adequate for one night.
96814,1479485,4,gordochouu,19/08/2021,"Perfect place to spend a night near Porto. Quiet, only the waves of the sea can be heard"

96814,1100404,3,PeteAndMel,20/10/2020,Spacious carpark. Be careful if pulling in to the park at night time as there is a drop  just to the side the driveway. A little uneven but you won't loose sleep over it. Sleeping to the sounds of the waves crashing against the rocks is therapeutic
96814,1096982,5,cuniandrea,17/10/2020,Great view!
96814,1088024,5,JenniundLasse,10/10/2020,Breathtaking views of the ocean and the city! Lots of people coming and going. But at least that makes the place safe. Go straight to town with Uber for € 9.

96814,1065748,5,carlsbert81,23/09/2020,"This is a message for general knowledge. Be careful with a Spanish individual who says his name is Paco, Asturian. He tells you about a battle of the host ... and manages to feel sorry and try to help him with money. Caution."
96814,1039333,5,Adriankanhy,10/09/2020,"We spent 2 nights with the van, we took the table out for dinner and without any problem. The day we left in the morning, the famous Asturian they spoke of in some comment came to speak with us, but I didn't pay much attention to him since we were picking up. Leaving that aside the site is great, with wonderful views"
96814,1037172,4,alcazar814,09/09/2020,ATTENTION!! Good place to sleep with good views and quiet but be careful with a scammer who calls himself Paco Asturiano as he says of Luarco I leave you the photo is usually in the A / C and camper parking areas and moves through Porto and Lisbon
96814,1022030,4,lsg79,02/09/2020,A place with spectacular views. You sleep with the noise of the sea. In the morning many people out for a walk and doing sports
96814,1014284,5,silviamanuelita,30/08/2020,We arrived on a Saturday night and it is a very quiet place where there were only cars with couples. The best awakening you can have with those views.

96814,998442,4,nfportugal,24/08/2020,Large parking lot overlooking Porto directly on the sea. Trash cans are available. When we stayed overnight there were unfortunately many young people with their cars and loud music in the parking lot until late at night.
96814,994432,5,AlexBD,23/08/2020,We were yesterday afternoon until today noon. Beautiful sunset and a lot of calm Sleeping with the noise of the waves and the freshness of the sea is great!
96814,981773,5,ClaireetMartin,19/08/2020,"Easily accessible parking located at the end of a road, facing the sea, 10 minutes from the historic heart of Porto. A word of advice: come before nightfall to admire the sunset."

96814,952709,3,Carreira957,11/08/2020,Very nice place but clearly impossible to sleep properly with the night activity nearby
96814,935252,4,timkw,07/08/2020,"Great parking lot to stay overnight, perfect sunset with a view of stones and the sea (no toilets, but there are bars in the vicinity). 20 minutes away from Porto, so not very quiet at night."
96814,860585,4,patryopa85,11/07/2020,Perfect oceanfront parking. At night it is a place for couples but they do not bother either because they do not get out of their cars. Little noise or us very tired. I recommend
96814,787440,4,MSGT,27/02/2020,"Quiet night facing the ocean. Cradled by the strong sound of the waves, with little wind, we were able to unfold the lifting roof. Some vehicles parked certainly in the evening until a certain hour (hidden lovers ...) but not very annoying in reality. Everything must depend on the time of year and week! We stayed here overnight from Wednesday to Thursday. We were only 2 vans."

96814,700904,4,Leclercqz,22/09/2019,Stunning beautiful view of the sea impression of remoteness while close to Porto. We stayed on a Saturday night which may explain the incessant passage of cars until ......? Despite this I recommend
96814,684087,5,SoniaJose,10/09/2019,Great sea view sunset there is staying two very quiet nights.
96814,667646,5,gondolar0,30/08/2019,"Amazing sunset, we set the table for dinner. There was no nighttime riding activity. From our best experiences in AC"
96814,604103,4,albarnipe,06/08/2019,Spectacular seaside place. Simple and level access. It is true that couples are going to let off steam but it is not so bad. Noise from the sea colliding with the rocks that I personally love to fall asleep.
96814,597910,3,nandin,04/08/2019,"Good place ... it seemed quiet but it is very busy all night. Among fishermen and couples in search of their moment of glory, they have not stopped all night. What is commonly known as riding school. We have spent a Saturday night and too much noise and people on the move. 2 motor homes and three campers."
96814,530660,4,albabblablabla,27/06/2019,"A spectacular panorama We spent the night of San Juan, patron of Oporto, there was a lot of movement of cars and we went up to the nearest parking lot to sleep better. Surely on other dates there is not much problem"
96814,530341,3,Ethan1904,27/06/2019,"Parking attached to the rocks, you can park in the surroundings too. Fair traffic of cars during the night, but the views are magnificent. Sure but without any kind of services."
96814,515447,1,Bekandchris,14/06/2019,"Beautiful views but didn't feel safe. Lots of cars and noise. Very windy.

96814,371153,5,delfechou,12/09/2018,Good spot. no worries with the heavy weight. certainly the passage but nothing really annoying. #towardstake #familygreenheat #checksetwithptivanDD
96814,370555,3,dedeVW,11/09/2018,"Peaceful place at night. It's great with the waves and not the seagulls on the roof of the van .. The passage in the day and far enough from Porto, or have bikes. No service."
96814,363173,4,nathetal,02/09/2018,"Very nice place with a beautiful sunset but beware we were Friday, August 31, cars coming and going until 2 am and the fishermen arrive at 7 am, fortunately we still slept well thanks to the noise of waves."

96823,3186042,3,jyepes1,20/08/2023,"extremely busy place, we were on a rainy day at 10 am and got lucky with the last spot, access road it's also challenging. it might be better to park by the Roman ruins and walk to the pools. locals advice to not swim at the lake and stick to the hot pools because of pollution"
96823,3169126,5,siggimueller,17/08/2023,"A very nice place to stay, unfortunately no fresh water and no old water on this place. In 1.7 km everything is available fresh water and old water to dispose of. The natural thermal baths have 30 to 50 degrees... It's just a shame and a shame that some wild campers use the forest as a sewage treatment plant. At the weekend it is very crowded but cozy...guitar sounds, flute, accordion was very comfortable..."
96823,2917244,5,Elebetti,02/07/2023,Great spot. Easy to reach. No services. Some spots are in the shade of trees. Very quite and beautiful. No light pollution.
96823,2876423,3,herve.galaxy,21/06/2023,"The site is nice but actually a lot of people with a constant coming and going where everyone puts music on. The weather was not good and we did not stay there at night so as not to wade through the earth, a lot of mosquitoes too."
96823,2752628,4,anjamanu,15/05/2023,"Nice place. However, the pools were flooded. Are probably only available in summer."
96823,2517727,1,F.L.Ortiz,09/12/2022,"The place is very pretty, but it is turning into a shabby and shanty town. People are disrespectful and they are deteriorating a natural area with illegal campers. The forest begins to be a dunghill, where they piss and load uncontrollably. There are people very wars. It's a shame."
96823,2495586,4,eagle555,14/11/2022,"Fine, near the springs. Busy and no further services. But super under the trees"
96823,2489153,3,Leonsuewe,09/11/2022,"The sources are insane. Unfortunately, the place is very crowded by many campers."
96823,2487426,5,Casper2000,08/11/2022,"We are lucky to be there when the level of the lake is low, so we have access to the 4 basins since none is under the waters of the lake. The pools have temperatures of 29°C to 42°C. It's heavenly! There is also a part with individual bathtubs."
96823,2449068,5,Perryneta,17/10/2022,"I stayed last Thursday and wonderful. It is true that there are always vans and caravans, but the atmosphere, both times that I have been, is always pleasant, calm."
96823,2437823,2,alfag11,11/10/2022,"Very nice setting next to the hot springs, but crowded with motorhomes, it looked like a campsite! We looked for another quieter place to sleep since we sensed that this was going to be very noisy."
96823,2432008,5,AkameTetsu,08/10/2022,Beautiful ❤️ It's not level almost anywhere but it's still worth it.
96823,2326721,3,shmatka,31/08/2022,"It's a very nice spot with direct access to Roman thermal pools, next to a lake. We didn't intent to stay overnight, but when we came, the place looked like a small hippie camping, which we found sympathetic and decided to stay. However, we didn't have a good sleep. the place is very loud, someone just next to us took about 10 minutes to repark their van at 2 am, a lot of people, a lot of noise."
96823,2294665,3,esperanzailamanu,24/08/2022,"A Sirio Mia well located in front of the swamp and with two outdoor thermal pools, with green and shade around it. Too bad it is very crowded and somewhat noisy at night."
96823,2289545,3,imanolUriarte,23/08/2022,"Parking is always chaotic, bad for a nap or sleep. but the place is beautiful."
96823,2283254,3,Glotren,22/08/2022,"Very nice setting but crowded. There were motorhomes, vans, cars and even tents. The forest is the shithole of the area, the parking area smells like piss and is full of paper (the typical cleanex and ass paper). Let's go that the brutal environment, the very slutty people."
96823,2241032,3,cuchicheo,15/08/2022,"Beautiful setting, it's a shame people litter. We're spoiling a wonderful place for disrespectful people. There is also quite a lot of noise at night from some vans."
96823,2219536,1,stormchaser,11/08/2022,"Only recommended in the high season if you want to enjoy hot springs. There is a coming and going in the parking lot from morning until after sunset, and when the traffic has calmed down late, the drumming concert of the ever-present hippies gets going late into the night."
96823,2181710,4,JilfaMax,05/08/2022,Spectacular and very quiet. 6 level seats with views of the water and the same number of slightly inclined seats on the second line.
96823,2171654,1,djacquin,04/08/2022,"Really good! Too many people installed with too many dogs that the owners of the vans let loose and bark constantly (I have a dog with us but you will never hear him, question of training!), we did not stay in the direction of the other spot next door, ten times quieter!"
96823,2128998,5,QuiqueArriaza,27/07/2022,"The place is beautiful and quiet, but having a FREE area a few minutes walk along the contour of the lake, you should not spend the night here. There we have to take care of the environment and it could become a place with prohibitions if we misuse the landscape. Good hot springs with several pools of different temperatures and the walk to the Roman ruins is very good and recommended."
96823,2122846,2,elvi,25/07/2022,"We entered because we thought the entrance was very bad, but then we parked in the motorhome area that is below and we walked about 12 minutes, there was enough space and a large van, there were two very hot pools even with bubbles and another in the river warm"

no facilities but beautiful spot 
few other vans over night too"
96823,1984995,5,henkrijksen,17/06/2022,"top spot on a large lake, where you can swim, paddle, kayak and enjoy! the 3 hot springs make it complete. very nice to sit in at night. we have been 3 days but would have liked to stay a few more days, lots of nice people!! busy with locals on weekends but not disturbing. highly recommend! lots of shade parking spots!!!"
96823,1976989,5,garrecmichel,14/06/2022,Large shaded car park? we spent 2 nights really great a lot of people on the weekend otherwise the week rather quiet I recommend
96823,1954169,5,sachatromp,06/06/2022,"you have to go to this place with an open mind. There are a lot of ""hippies"" around and some like to swim naked here. Despite this it is a super cozy place. As a solo woman I felt super nice here. Of course the source is delicious, I sat until half past 12 in the evening. the only drawback is the difficult entrance, some spots are very uneven and many locals until 7 o'clock"
96823,1890576,5,FurgoPoch,15/05/2022,"Fantastic, 5 Stars"
96823,1862918,5,SpmRmo,01/05/2022,"Saturday, April 30, we slept one night and everything was super quiet even though there were many vans and motorhomes, everyone was super quiet. As much as the comments say, nobody bothers anyone at any time. It is a perfect place."
96823,1855870,4,Leonhymer,27/04/2022,Very pleasant source of very hot water. It is a place known by smokers and the like. We did not stay there overnight.
96823,1830749,5,Lorena8,17/04/2022,"It's a beautiful place but too many people. What they say in the previous comments is true, you see that people camp there and stay for several days, for the rest the environment is very healthy."
96823,1803164,5,saarafnk,01/04/2022,"Beautiful place to spend the day, we stayed one night and I think that’s enough maybe two if it’s not so many people there cuz like previous comment said, it’s a parking area not a campsite so others can come and enjoy the place for a night too."
96823,1791310,3,julls,22/03/2022,"Please stop abusing this area don’t treat it like a camping site if you want that go to a camping site just over the other side of river , if you want a motor home stop over go down the road as this is a car park"
96823,1783989,4,manny_la_belle_vie,15/03/2022,"perfect spot. in the middle of the forest, view of the lake, promenade and hot spring. Attention, the lake immerses the car park 6 months of the year. If you're heavy/loaded, have a small engine, the ride up is very steep, we almost got stuck. Ps: if you have dogs with a bad reminder please tie them up, don't let them bark at everyone or we will be banned"
96823,1676932,4,YanaPez,04/11/2021,"In the off season this is the perfect spot. Very busy with other vans, but spring water less than 10m from where you park. Four different temperatures."
96823,1659358,3,PabloRichartz,24/10/2021,"Very nice place with free roman thermal baths and beautiful view. Very busy, even at night, with young people. The smell of marijuana was also noticeable during the day. Remains of an old Roman city have been excavated in the immediate vicinity."
96823,1590479,1,AnaEntenza,19/09/2021,"It is a river not a lake. It is extremely forbidden to camp and spend the night, there is a very clear sign and the police come by every day to kick you out, that if it was full of vans and here after we complain about the fines. In the hot springs, bathing is prohibited due to covid19 and people bathe the same so more fines ... And above all, people incivate ruios, screams, alcohol, marijuana, music, garbage ... A shame"

96823,1166790,2,CuniOrge,04/04/2021,"I do not recommend it. Downhill steep, narrow. The space next to the river, at least when I was with the water level very high, remains very narrow, with problems even to maneuver and turn. Much more reasonable to go to the area within a couple of kilometers. From there you can get to the hot springs by a little path next to the river"
96823,1142335,1,Camperman2019,25/02/2021,Totally flooded. Parking is under water.
96823,1133327,5,Rietzschel,27/01/2021,One of the most beautiful places an our trip so far. The hot water source is closed due to covid. We used it anyway just like the locals. The police only checks the 2 meter distance bullshit
96823,1121838,4,abeccas,17/12/2020,"It is a grove without defined places to park,. in high season it sure gets crowded. It is well worth the stop and enjoy a free thermal bath. we don't sleep here."
96823,1117016,4,Marypk,22/11/2020,"Secluded and very quiet place to sleep, despite being very frequented by people who come to the hot springs at night. I don't hear any noise, just nature. We were about 8-9 vans staying overnight. The hot springs are prohibited by the covid, but people do bathe anyway."
96823,1082545,2,Camperman2019,05/10/2020,"Covid 19 law: It's illegal to bath now. Police raided the place today with 5 police vans. Jumped all people with a bathingsuit and fined them. Also, only the top bath is visible, the others are still under water and it's all very dirty. Not the best place to be at the moment."
96823,1042702,5,joanaru,12/09/2020,At a beautiful lake with hot springs where you can have a nice bath! The hot springs are a little bit fishy but if you enter at the left there are benches to sit inside and they are less muddy so highly recommend

96823,649559,4,Jayla,21/08/2019,"We did a night accompanied by motor homes, caravans, vans and tents. Although there is a sign of prohibited camping, we were surprised that there were many camps. There is a lot of movement of cars day and night, it is worth at least one night the spectacular surroundings. Beware of the descent that scares but the motorhomes have a good time, the caravans are small."
96823,643881,3,ruimartins,19/08/2019,Spectacular place to spend a few days in thermal waters. We spent a very good night. Bathing in the warm water at night full of outdoor stars is simply brutal.

96823,438108,3,lukew,09/03/2019,Arrived today. all pools completely immersed underwater.
96823,433239,5,ChrisnRay,24/02/2019,"Wonderful place to chill out before the final journey to the ferry. We arrived around 4pm drove down the steep access track and found the parking area was crowded. We went for a walk and when we got back the crowds had started to drift home. Fantastic time in the hot pool as the rest were underwater. Care is needed getting in and out of the pools as they are slippery. We saw 5 people slip and hurt themselves, 3 were carrying phones which ended up wet. You have been warned!"
96823,414109,5,LDVgirl,14/12/2018,"Great place, parking right in front of the thermal pools. Busy during the day, but empty in the morning and late evening. 

Big waste containers, excellent mobile connection. 

Access road is very steep indeed, but we had no problem with our old motorhome.

Guardia Civil passed several times but didn't say anything.  

Def recommend this place."
96823,414105,5,bumblebussing,14/12/2018,"Incredible one of the best places we have stayed due the the Roman thermal pools.
No services, unlevel parking and a steep and narrow access road. We were fine in large van and plenty of motor homes came and parked. (there is easier access down the road)
 Camping is prohibited, but the police came by and said nothing I think camper vans are allowed. Wonderful hot pools. lots of slippery algae."
96828,2156251,4,campy1001,01/08/2022,"perfect to eat to sleep very peacefully, the only thing you possibly sleep only the picnic tables are great because they are not anchored to the ground and you can find shade"

96828,974740,2,gerska,17/08/2020,It can be worth it if you arrive at night because the park is in the middle of a neighborhood of houses so you are really parked next to the sidewalk. Something before arriving you pass by the electricity museum that the parking is not wonderful but at least you are not between houses
96860,856798,1,trutxi,09/07/2020,The ranger made us of the place because apparently he cannot camp. The access road is very narrow and uncomfortable for motorhomes.

96894,1469727,4,YerLm,17/08/2021,No noise and very close to the beach. We were going to stay in the parking lot next door but when we put it forbidden we did not trust ourselves. There were more vans and there is a bathroom a little higher.

There is public toilet and water. Good and quiet place to go to the beach of Berria but away from the town of Santoña."
96894,519177,1,javitxus,17/06/2019,Vehicles of more than 5.5 meters in length have been set up as a barrier for height limitation and forbidden signs. You can park next to the cemetery wall online.
96894,410401,3,bumblebussing,27/11/2018,"We stopped here for the night, no troubles, right next to the beach.

 Not that much space if you are a big van but there are a few spaces further up past the campground as well. 

Not sure if it's prohibited here as height restriction signs everywhere, but plenty of free spaces in the car parks for small campers.

 Thanks for the tip...as not easy to find a space here for a bigger van."

After crossing, you walk a bit and can bathe in the clean waters of the Atlantic. Watch out for the return hours. (I will never understand the remains of toilet paper left by the vans either.)"

Cons: it’s in an urban setting next to a derelict housing estate down the road from a village of McMansions. A bit grim but actual site is great."

In our opinion that is essential! It is indicated that you can wash at the campsite but the washing machine is old and especially dirty. We find the price-quality ratio to be very bad, mainly because of no service point."

96981,2232140,2,Family4Road,13/08/2022,"A small and cozy campsite with the basics. They did not make reservations. Important two DATA: they have spent the whole summer without a point to empty gray water (we were notified upon arrival) and there are two VERY poor accesses to reach the campsite. One is impracticable (for which Google Maps took me and there they blamed Google) and the one they justify as the ""good"" access is full of ruts and is a dirt road far from being a decent access."

DIRECTIONS - we had no trouble coming through the town in our 3.5t moho, after one false start caused by our confused moho satnav. Enter Beniloba from the east end, using Av Elegantissima Diputacion. L onto C. Alacant, right onto C. Verge del Dolors. L onto C. Cervantes, then L onto C Sant Josep. R onto C Les Forques. Hook round to the left as you leave town, then first right, just after a house. Follow the road for 400-500m, turn R onto a concrete road. I recommend you follow the route on a map before trying it for real, and avoid the most busy times of day. We’re going to try the shorter route out to the CV road, but don’t know if that will work as another reviewer recommended coming via the town. It looks fine on Google Maps...."

it didn't have services but the view, and sleeping with the  sound of the waves totally makes up for it. 
there are several places next to the dirt road, and we manage to get one that was protected from the wind by some rocks. 
20min walk from the village of Peniche, so for us a really nice walk to go for dinner and drinks. if you are in the mood for a really nice Portuguese meal with really nice prices go to Restaurante Rocha"

97286,2192450,4,MrGustave,07/08/2022,"To reach this place, following the road, turn right ""playa 200m"". At the end of the path, it is possible to go further and stand between pines and the beach.

We were alone, both in the parking lot and around it (there are no houses) and we decided to stay the night to take photos of the starry sky at night. After taking photos for a while and without seeing any light in the forest, we began to hear the voices of a man talking alone among the trees. So we decided to go. Bad roll."

No barrier sign upstream prohibiting parking on the site of the ideal business to make money on the backs of tourists. I consider it to be organized theft Employees of the municipal police unpleasant dialogue impossible considering us as thugs! 1st bad experience of this type in Portugal.
97303,2272146,1,Souchalfamily,20/08/2022,Woken up at 8 a.m. by our neighbors (thanks to them!) to clear off quickly. We avoided the fine: a large deployment of police was in place!

97303,2215358,4,mfcenruta,11/08/2022,"Good place to sleep, there are no services at all but if you are autonomous, ideal to spend the night. Sea and sunset views to behold. Small but you can hear the planes go by, but it doesn't bother you much, it lets you sleep. If there were water it would be perfect."

97303,2151053,5,hoffibernd,31/07/2022,"If the non-self-sufficient campers didn't leave their droppings in the bushes along the way, the place would be even nicer. It's rude not to even take the paper with you. If the city forbids staying here, we'll know who's to blame."
97303,2124655,5,ulysse42000,26/07/2022,"Perfect for visiting Porto! We spent 2 nights there, starting by bike directly from the car park which joins the bike paths and the beach just below! Very nice view of the mouth of the Douro!"

We had a good night there, but it was yesterday, a Monday that we still heard something, we were able to have a good night. I think the views make up for it. Also right next to it there is a parking lot that is quieter but until the afternoon is full of cars and is also tilted."

97303,515440,4,Bekandchris,14/06/2019,"Stayed here 2 nights. Great spot. Free without amenities. Despite it looking like it could be very windy it wasn't at all. Plenty of space to share with other campers. Pre warning- multiple couples making out in the back of their cars... 
We ended up driving a bit closer to town to see Porto as it would be quite a walk from this location. Plenty of free day parking along the river."

Road up here is very narrow and lots of turns, definitely not suitable for motorhomes.
However, for hiking it is beautiful, village has a great atmosphere and the view from Mirador above village is amazing."
97351,2224604,4,anii_chu,12/08/2022,Quite acceptable for one night if you have just arrived in Lisbon or have moved the car (because of the strip that you have to pay). It is close to the center (20min approx). The entrance must be done carefully due to the incline but it is well saved. Quiet night although it is next to a construction zone. Restrooms in the market about 5 minutes away and minipreço (supermarket) 5 minutes away

97371,2752379,4,kriesvdb,15/05/2023,"For those looking for peace. Very nice well maintained campsite on a large domain with a swimming pool without chlorine. Everything super neat. Bread service. Nearby Roman remains in Bobadela and in Vila Nova de Oliverinha an interactive museum about olive cultivation with a good restaurant. You can do your shopping in Vila Nova do Hospital, about 10 km from the campsite. A tough climb."

97371,769293,3,VollzeitVanlife,16/01/2020,"Very nice owners and really nice place with a fantastic view and especially in winter a lot of space. However, only conditionally recommended for the winter months, as the large bath house is really cold. Even far below the outside temperature. Unfortunately, construction work started after two nights. Due to the change of location we decided to continue driving."

This is not a regimented site but very relaxed. Facilities are spotless and completely up to date. Bread delivery at 8.30 every morning except Sunday. We are a 5 ton twin axel 8.5mtr motorhome and this was October after rain and no access problems. Lovely Dutch owners. Would definitely return
97371,348991,5,Fleur123,22/08/2018,"A camping owned by a friendly Dutch couple. They gave us a nice spot near a small stream and our own picknick table. Toilets en showers are high quality and very clean. 
Every friday evening the custumers of the camping are invited to come and eat 
at the neighbours place. 
Swimming pool is natural, so no chemicals are added. The plants are keeping the pool clean. 
This camping is recommended!"

97419,3177789,4,Evaheemskerk,19/08/2023,"Nice campsite. Everything has been well thought out; large swimming pool not accessible for the little ones, playground next to restaurant. Lots of children's entertainment, this is great! Good food and friendly staff. Great places, not much privacy everywhere. Disadvantage; too few sanitary facilities and not always clean."
97419,3107986,2,cogolino,09/08/2023,"Despite a pleasant setting, the swimming pool and sanitary facilities are too small compared to the size of the campsite. Poorly delineated pitches. Big plot, small plot, no difference except the price. without water tap on the plot. the pitches are on top of each other. a lot of promiscuity. reservation only by WEB so impossible to get an idea before paying."

97419,2957738,3,CharlesAudrey24,13/07/2023,"Pleasant site in a rural location. We stayed 2 nights. Only downsides being insufficient sanitary facilities for the size of the site (there are only 4 mens WCs when they are all in operation) and day to day maintenance seems to be neglected (toilet flushes and doo locks etc.). There is no shade and we were infested with flies although we couldn’t see why. Friendly staff, and a useful shop."
97419,2955825,4,IACO31,12/07/2023,"A very good campsite with a good price. It really has everything, even a restaurant and a market. The only flaw, in addition to the lack of hairdryers in the bathrooms, is the great distance from Pamplona, therefore the lack of transport during the week, but the reception are very exhaustive on how to get to the centre. Even during San Fermin!"

97419,2867971,5,BduS,18/06/2023,"Relatively new campsite. You can see that in everything. Modern and well cared for. Pitches are spacious and level. The roads on the campsite are somewhat narrow. For 8.5m max. Sanitary facilities are clean, only showers are a bit narrow/small. Excellent supermarket, swimming pool and restaurant. Many locals also come there. Tip: book dinner. With ACSI all incl.: €21 p/n. Cycling to Pamplona is possible via a good road (18 km) with reasonable hills."
97419,2807093,5,Robinwomo,31/05/2023,"Very nicely situated terrace CP, lovingly designed terrain with a view of the small place worth seeing with the kathl. Church. Sanitary facilities are great, including the washing-up area and the waste disposal."

There is a supermarket and a restaurant on the camping site. In the morning you can hear the bells of the sheep in the pasture next door, very nice. I found the road to get there a bit steep (Almandoz - Arraizko Bentak) but my bus is old and not that strong."

Very well maintained, very nice, helpful staff, very nice surroundings. In the evening it is still quite 'loud' and sociable outside. For us, with children who are up late, ideal :) The absolute highlight was the neighbor who fed the red kites <3"
97419,2446304,1,francinehieber,16/10/2022,"positive points: courteous welcome from the owner - new sanitary facilities fairly well maintained - small mini-market negative points: narrow and expensive pitches value for money (HS 26 E car tent for 2) Restaurant 30 m from the pitches and a lot of rowdy adults children shouting until 1am, not great for resting. many mobile homes, and unruly customers"
97419,2428572,4,roadiesol,07/10/2022,We spent a great night out of season at this clean and recent campsite. although in the summer it must be hell as the pitches are stuck together. the swimming pool was not accessible in October.
97419,2349567,2,lisinka,07/09/2022,"Recent campsite, clean and impeccable sanitary The objective is to place a maximum of people in a minimum of space, pitches glued without any delimitation We have taken the small plot formula (25€ per night for 2 people without electricity) which corresponds to half of a large plot. There is room for a tent, a table and 2 chairs I do not recommend at all!"
97419,2295815,4,gabrielehelene,24/08/2022,"What a beautiful place - we are here for three nights, an eldorado for road bike tours. The campsite is young - which can be seen from the small trees that do not yet offer shade. The service is great, the facility is clean, the view of the woods is very nice, I'd love to come back."
97419,2289447,4,JonathanVertou,23/08/2022,"Family campsite in the heart of nature, surrounded by animals. Arrived at 5 p.m. there were pitches available for caravanning and tents. For us in van 2adults and 2children, 44€. Very clean sanitary facilities, however a bit cramped. no hedges between the plots, it makes the campsite as spacious and natural... super pleasant swimming pool. Calm, apart from the chickens, a machine that makes noise continuously"
97419,2272262,5,EvaSoHam,20/08/2022,"A great campsite, well located and with all amenities. Very clean, perfect toilets. To put a snag in the camping area, the ground was cracked but I suppose that is normal due to the lack of rain. For us great, the guys unbeatable and the girls at the bar great."
97419,2257986,5,Maxbenji,17/08/2022,"Indeed, this campsite is very well kept, very clean, spacious pitches, fair prices, pleasant staff. Nice swimming pool. Very out of the way, from the main roads, even in high season there is availability. To recommend."

We arrived in the evening and left in the morning so in terms of heat, being the trees so young and still small, I don't know how it is during the day with the fierce sun and how to hang out the laundry. A little expensive but deserving."
97419,2209950,3,babybels,10/08/2022,"I give it three stars because the intention is good, but with these temperatures it is unbearable. There is no shade on any plot, not a little, but none. Not only that, but you also can't put up awnings because since the trees are so small, you have nowhere to tie anything. The pool is saved for you with a mini shade under some awnings that people already reserve with their towels from the first hour."
97419,2184801,4,doradruif,06/08/2022,"Beautiful walking area 20 minutes drive from Pamplona. Swimming pool is present but water was found cold by the children. Many youth present, French and Spanish. Evening animation. Trees are still young so little shade. The campsite has a very relaxed atmosphere and the staff is friendly and cheerful. Food is good."

Campsite is still fairly new, laid out on terraces. The restaurant is a meeting place for nature lovers, the local population who are provided with delicious dishes.
