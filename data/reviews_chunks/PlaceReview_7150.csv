96065,2040443,2,Akuna,05/07/2022,It is the parking lot of a supermarket. No vans of motorhomes. I’m not staying tonight as I’m not sure you can. There is no sign explaining if you can stay or even if this is a motorhome area.  There are washing machines to use.
96065,1919949,5,catarinaarosa,27/05/2022,"I had a calm night, there where no other vans or campers when I arrived, or the next morning. There were a few cars in the washing station in the begging of the night, then stopped, but it’s a service open 24 hours. I used the bathroom in INTERMARCHÉ in the morning and it was extremely clean."
96065,1900530,4,liconoclast,19/05/2022,"Fairly quiet place, a bit of noise during the night but nothing too disturbing. Access to a water tap for motorhomes appreciable. We spent the night there before hitting the road again. I recommend for one night between two long journeys."
96065,1884396,3,Chausson22019,11/05/2022,Spent one night in the parking lot. No problem. In the evening there were 2 buses (the engine was running while cleaning) and a number of private cars. After midnight it got quiet. Washing machines were ok.
96065,1764137,5,redadoree,23/02/2022,Went to do our washing and some shopping - didn't use the other services. The card machine at the laundry wasn't working so it only took coins. Staff in supermarket were very helpful and gave me change. The kiosk usually has more change than cashiers. Shame only one large washing machine. Okay on stuff not too dirty but anything really bad would need soak first. 18kg took 40 mins to dry.
96065,1743284,5,corentinanna,29/01/2022,"Very practical emptying and filling, laundry and carwash. Very clean. Toilets available in the Intermarché."

96065,1710692,5,DD9QE,16/12/2021,"Everything was great, we went shopping and did our laundry. Currently 4 euros for 8 kg. Dryer from 2 euros. Quiet parking space for the night, from 9 a.m. it is possible to buy rolls or bread."
96065,1700263,5,maria41,29/11/2021,"As other posters said, very big parking lot near the Intermarche, which incidentally is open Sunday all day till 8pm! Very peaceful night. The supermarket has toilets inside although we did not use them in the end. Perfect for a stop over."
96065,1632252,5,CarlosArsenio,08/10/2021,"Free service area for motorhomes, located in the Intermarché car park. It is possible to supply water, pour dirty water and toilet cassette. Very quiet at night but we opted to stay overnight in the fairgrounds park, which is right next door."
96065,1625841,5,jcesarco,04/10/2021,"Very quiet place to stay with all the services, I recommend"
96065,1619452,5,chloegreen,01/10/2021,"Staying here tonight after a long drive up from the south coasts, everything we needed to refill water, empty waste, toilets inside supermarket and bought a few snacks. We took a walk around and saw the other park4night just up the road looks really nice at night, but next to the windmill makes a very odd loud noise, so we are staying here where it's quiet."
96065,1603458,4,vivo,24/09/2021,"Spent a safe and quiet night, one other parked up too. No problems, thank you Intermarche. Nice to enjoy an early morning cuppa within walking distance. ;-)"

96065,1506666,5,Seixalito,24/08/2021,"Everything flawless. Good water pressure to fill the tank. Everything very clean. We wash the motorhome, clothes, stock up on food at the supermarket and have a light meal at Intermarché. Excellent stopover on the way to the Algarve."
96065,1424825,4,verliebte_aussteiger,08/08/2021,We were to be emptied. Unfortunately there is no drinking water here. But we could wash our mobile again.
96065,1333493,5,vivoforta,17/07/2021,All free! Thank you Intermarché!

96065,477432,2,Patmano,06/05/2019,"Can not drain the toilet is all clogged, too bad because there is not much service around, to review for operation?"
96065,457561,3,mafquim,17/04/2019,Easy access and with an optimal system to pour chemical cassette. The gray water grill is too small and poorly positioned. The water is not drinkable which is worth it.
96065,438049,3,francis1947,09/03/2019,"Good for emptying, free water but not drinkable"
96065,432352,5,herumtreibaer,23/02/2019,All service facilities are working properly and clean again.

96084,3029028,3,GuillaumeWeill,27/07/2023,"Access difficult to find. Narrow path with branches that rub on the bodywork. Ruts in the way. To be avoided with a large size. Afterwards it is a very quiet, beautiful and wild area but you can still hear the road well."
96084,2966014,5,annsinlangdale,15/07/2023,Lots of parking places up here hidden in the woods. We took the next left turn after this one which just after the crawler lane finished on the climb up from Muros. just after a small traffic  sign before the Windmills. The tracks open up once your through the gap in the highway.  Our option with 4WD was to drive down to a clearing. Nice flat grassy pitch. The Wind Farm hum kept us company.
96084,2218334,5,sbarthe4galicia,11/08/2022,Magnificent site. Alone in the world in the middle of the forest. At a 100m walk there is an incredible view over Carnota beach.
96084,641817,2,cesarmos,19/08/2019,"They have paved the road that leads to the point and is not accessible, or the coordinates are not exactly those, tested with several apps."
96104,2768018,3,tjandvvinavan,20/05/2023,"Pros: Flat spot, nice views of the coast. Cons: right beside busy road, no privacy, no toilets, small spaces"

96104,2503299,3,bella6644,23/11/2022,"It's still roadside parking. Very sloping, normal in the mountains. However, the view is magnificent. We spent one night there, relatively quiet from 10:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. If you are heavy sleepers, to avoid for the dodo."
96104,2484643,1,Arto2018,06/11/2022,Parking only possible for smaller vehicles.
96104,2281978,3,maxim6,21/08/2022,"Parking rather flat, arrived in the middle of the night we found a place easily, beautiful view on waking, passage of a few cars but not too awkward."
96104,1793265,3,mariuspyonline,24/03/2022,"Great for having a break, watchting sunset or sunrise. The night was quite loud with traffic, people used the horn of their car to wake us up. If you really nees to rest, go for another place."
96104,1576468,3,silvia_23,14/09/2021,We stayed here. Very loud but okay with earplugs. Really nice view in the morning.
96104,1561707,4,Kangoorouxfrisee,09/09/2021,"Very nice view of the sea from this small roadside car park with a few parking spaces. A few cars stop there to admire the view. Free parking, no problem to spend the night there. Fairly busy road even at night. No amenities nearby."
96104,1497749,3,Alice63,22/08/2021,"Nice point of view. You have to arrive at the right time to find space (3 motorhomes max). Really on the side of the road, the cars pass quickly and honk their horns early in the morning."
96104,1486116,4,Caddykalle,20/08/2021,"Nice view, but right on the street and difficult to find toilets. If you get up early enough, you can definitely see the sunrise here ... but we couldn't do that: D"
96104,1406682,3,lillymayr,05/08/2021,"Great view, but noisy due to the street next to the parking spot."
96104,1151005,3,Irubon,13/03/2021,It is one of the viewpoints on the road so the views are very good. At this time there are works so there is only one lane and cars pass continuously (except at night). There is a bit of unevenness.
96104,1015987,4,Ixiar,31/08/2020,"It does not have any service but it is true that the views are spectacular. Cars hardly pass at night and you sleep well, despite the incline."
96104,659342,3,GaspardLeCampingCar,25/08/2019,"Beautiful view of the ocean, about 10 cars available so a camper can take a lot of space ... If unavailable there is a second car park of the same size 300m further. Parking on a slope so difficult to be level. No water, no electricity, no light and no network."

96154,3253876,4,Abril20,03/09/2023,"Large esplanade of land under the pines, uneven ground. Lots of parking spaces. Sign allowing to spend the night and forbidden to use picnic material; penalty of up to €300. 10 minutes from the center. For us, ideal for visiting the village and the castle. We went to the fair of Indians and highly recommended! Garbage with chip; they cannot be left."
96154,3186436,3,tintinisa53,20/08/2023,"Very good location 1.3 km from Begur Castle. Location in the shade between the trees; there are still a lot of places that are flat. Yes it's not it's not happening not the right to take out the chairs and tables, but very practical for the night because very quiet no noise! Only downside smell of urine probably caused by travelers without toilets …"
96154,3090113,4,magaloche,06/08/2023,"it's free without services, but very few pitches are flat. avoid the places on the football field side, this path is used by masters with their dogs who seem to have forgotten that the ''deposits'' of their animals can be picked up and put in a bag. the trash room is locked (card required) and therefore cannot be used by coach operators."
96154,3022829,5,Zoombiker27,26/07/2023,"Area between large trees, very quiet to spend the night (allowed, no camping). Behind soccer field, ideal for visiting Begur. No services."
96154,3003428,5,Simonht,22/07/2023,"Stayed there for 2 nights. It was perfect. Close to the city center, calm, large area, undisturbed. Would recommend if you want to visit Begur. There're buses to go to the beaches from the city center, really practical"
96154,2859780,5,JuriAngyGini,16/06/2023,"very quiet parking, the police come to check"
96154,2790946,4,alexyanezdelacal,27/05/2023,"Good place to visit Begur. With shade and trees. Located next to a soccer field, if they play there are fewer places available. We have also found a place in the shade"
96154,2777667,4,julien59880,23/05/2023,"great spot, be careful not to take out the camping equipment (pop-up roof OK) the police come by every day to check. can be noisy when there are training and matches at the stadium otherwise nothing to say, well located for visiting the city of Begur"

96154,2392590,5,Tarque,21/09/2022,"Very quiet, with some shade and plenty of space. There is some unevenness, but it is a matter of looking for the flattest area."

96154,2254336,5,igorsope,17/08/2022,We have slept here and very well. The police just came to us saying that yesterday they stole a new motorhome and that we should be careful.
96154,2241010,5,SimoneAri,15/08/2022,Wide and totally wooded space. Quiet and clean. the tree-lined area gives the possibility to settle down without bothering other campers. Excellent both for small Vans and for larger vehicles. There are no rubbish bins as they are only accessible via a residents' card but can be kept aside and thrown in the bins in the village. Leave the place clean!
96154,2240551,5,Roadtrip56,15/08/2022,"large, quiet and shaded car park. access to the city in 10 minutes on foot and access to the magnificent Cala Sa tuna in 15 minutes by bus from the center. unmissable if you pass by here."
96154,2217744,5,jmesmel,11/08/2022,"Great place, with shade 100% recommended, and two minutes walk from the town center (where there is no parking for large vehicles). Better to book to go to dinner, and please, do not take anything out, which makes it very clear on the posters!"

96154,2200312,4,Nuele89,08/08/2022,"Perfect place to spend the night. Quiet, shady, plenty of space and about 15 minutes walk from the center. I have spent two nights in August and the truth is that it is not crowded at all."

96154,1747811,5,Bribri25,05/02/2022,parking behind the football field. know how to choose your place well so as not to be on a slope. We were alone in the world. Extraordinary calm. And the view is not too bad since we are near the forest. Close to the visit of a very beautiful city for those who are not afraid to walk a little.
96154,1626334,1,chantalderuyter,04/10/2021,Dirty (sale) lots of insects (beaucoup d insectes) uneven terrain (en pente). The parking at the roundabout a little further is much better. Le parking un peu plus loin au rond point est meilleur.
96154,1614292,4,pasdebols,28/09/2021,"Everything and said in the comments, quiet for one or two days, because as this and indicated at the entrance no camping, chairs or table, (beware of the dogs of walkers who do not have leashes, it is a options at home (laughs)"

96154,1448858,2,kmpera1387,13/08/2021,"Good place to spend the night, not camping. Since there is a municipal regulation that indicates this, as we were informed by the Tourist Office, as well as the police when they came to control the area. Of course ... people who do not deign to clean up their filth, you should be more respectful and supportive. Because then they end up closing or limiting parking lots like this because of the incivility and filthy of a few."
96154,1426426,5,RiRiRita,09/08/2021,"Ideal place to visit Begur. 5 minutes walk from the town. There is a supermarket nearby. It is a dirt parking lot in a shady pine forest. Apparently it is no longer allowed to take out chairs or awnings, but staying overnight."

At least there was a light on in one cabin in the women's area..."

We paid €24 for a night for 2 people with a camper. It worked out for that price because we got on a tent pitch. The departure is at 2:00 p.m. but since there were not many people, they let us stay until 5:00 p.m. Clean sinks but very dirty showers and lack of toilet paper."

For 2 people + child <1 year (and camper van) we paid 70 € for 2 nights. The sanitary facilities are rather old and partly run down. You should always have toilet paper with you.

In my opinion, the space can only be recommended to a limited extent for large mobile homes (from approx. 7.5 m). We hadn't reserved but were able to get a seat when we arrived around 3pm."
96281,2272580,5,clairette95,20/08/2022,"We spent one night in this campsite (4 adults), very welcoming staff who found us a pitch despite the full display. Very pleasant. Good services. No convenience store."
96281,2170618,4,MontseMarques,03/08/2022,"They do not reserve places for motorhomes, you have to go and try your luck, they usually have places but it is better to call beforehand to have an idea of if you can go. Simple but clean and pleasant campsite."
96281,2161333,4,estherdevries73,02/08/2022,"Beautiful charming campsite! Well maintained places. Clean sanitary facilities, furnished with taste (a bit outdated). We were keen to drop by the bodegas for wine tasting but they are closed in August. Had a great time, visit the old town for culinary delights."
96281,2139239,5,samtrauffer,29/07/2022,"Pretty little campsite with uncomplicated owners. Beautiful sanitary facilities, large outdoor pool in 5 minutes walking distance, old town in 10 minutes walking distance."
96281,2078910,4,mageo1,16/07/2022,"Very warm welcome, we spent one night without having booked. Shaded campsite, decent plots, very clean sanitary facilities"
96281,2036334,4,paulaquinyoneroperez,04/07/2022,"We slept one night, 4 people in a motorhome for 42.90 euros connected to electricity. The campsite is in good condition and very welcoming. At reception very attentive and pleasant!"
96281,1969931,5,deeDee1979,12/06/2022,this is definitely an older facility but very clean and staff is super helpful. We originally booked one night then decided to stay for a second night. lots of shade and minutes away from town by foot. area is also super quiet at night and there is a security guard at the gate at night so I felt very safe. during the day lots of kids around so it gets a bit noisy in case that matters to you
96281,1924286,4,skurl,28/05/2022,"Super city camping, clean and friendly. Only 10 minutes walk to the old town. Great restaurants and bars there. Great food at Tastavin."
96281,1902826,5,JanaDiele,20/05/2022,"Very cute campsite with nice statues! Beautiful bathrooms, cute plots. Under the trees with the river and city just around the corner. Our favorite part was the covered outdoor/cooking area, which protected us from the heat. There was also a hut with seating."
96281,1901074,3,phippie,19/05/2022,"Place is ok but not a revelation. Somewhat old and partly neglected sanitary facilities - buses and tents are accommodated in every free spot and sometimes very closely. You can tell they want to make the place as full as possible. However, the place lives from its location: in 15 minutes you are in the center of Logronos, where you can get incredibly good tapas. The place is totally okay for that."
96281,1853880,4,ninjazz,26/04/2022,"Pretty, very green, very quiet campsite near the old town and a river, ideal for dogs. The welcome is pleasant, pitches flat and shaded. The road is concreted to facilitate the circulation of motorhomes. The toilets are typical and to be seen, it is clean but a little damaged with the frames corroded by water. Count about 45€ for 1 motorhome for 4 people with electricity and taxes."
96281,1839386,1,Scheffralli,19/04/2022,A campsite with all the advantages. The price signals that you don't really want mobile homes (16 parking spaces). A real alternative is the parking space just in front of the campsite.
96281,1767075,5,CharlotteGuedon,26/02/2022,"Very good campsite, easy to access, welcoming staff, available and attentive despite the language barrier. Clean location. Very clean and well appointed toilets! Possibility to wash and dry your clothes for 8 euros (4€ and 4€). We paid €27 for a pitch for a truck without electricity."
96281,1689137,4,MimmiNiklas,14/11/2021,"Very good, very clean and nice facilities. Restaurants just outside the door.Many very nice tapas bars in the town in all price levels. Don’t miss a visit to the town, only 10 minutes."
96281,1685272,5,steffiibiza,11/11/2021,"Lovely small campsite next to the river Ebro. Extensive parks line the river, stunning at this time of the year with the autumn foliage. Very good and clean toilets and showers - the showers are really hot and have lots of pressure. 10 mins walk into town."
96281,1671272,4,Saroushe78,31/10/2021,30 € per night for 2 adults with a baby in a van with electricity we had a large pitch there are the necessary equipment including shower and toilet friendly staff calm
96281,1641142,5,soniagom,12/10/2021,"Camping next to the Ebro river. Very close to the center of Logroño. It is not very big and everything is very crowded, but it is very complete and the facilities and common areas are phenomenal. The bathrooms and showers super clean. There is WIFI but the signal does not reach the plots. You have to be close to reception to be able to connect. There is a park right at the entrance with swings for children and a restaurant where you can eat terrific. They do not reserve and it is possible that when they arrive they will not have a space."
96281,1604122,4,ElenaRdB,24/09/2021,"Small but nice campsite, right in town. Old town within walking distance. Few places, no reservations, arrive early!"
96281,1592589,4,Mireia6,19/09/2021,"Camping with plots very close together but well distributed, we had no problems but if you arrive later they make you park between bungalows. € 22 overnight for two adults + 2 dogs and a 1 year old child. 10min from town."
96281,1591051,2,stinneersted,19/09/2021,"Walking distance to town - clean but old baths and toilet facilities. Very small pitches, there was not proper space for our camper. No playground or other facilities for children. Very expensive, 52 € per night for 2 adults and 4 children (the youngest free)."
96281,1573412,4,xevisonia,12/09/2021,"Quiet campsite, very outdated but super clean toilets. Many of the plots do not have privacy as they are attached to a bungalow but it is worth it because of the proximity to the city center"
96281,1493136,5,domi33370,21/08/2021,"22 €, near the city center, clean toilets. And a place despite a full panel .... which says better"
96281,1470883,4,cess29,17/08/2021,"Much too expensive for what it is 45 € for 3 children and 2 adults in a camper van for 1 day. On the other hand, sanitary facilities, shower ... are very clean, but the pitches are very small but with a lot of shade, The campsite is well placed just 10 minutes from the center and / or bars, restaurant ... very practical There is no swimming pool but right next to a municipal swimming pool € 4.50"

Small campsite with great charm, right next to the river, with a great promenade with lots of trees !! All the campsite very clean as well as the bathrooms ... Very friendly and well-disposed staff. Lucky to have found it"
96281,1415461,1,blancabcsy,06/08/2021,"If you arrive in the morning, they may give you a good seat. As you arrive after eating, they will entertain you between bungalows or ""let you park"" at exits from other plots, with zero privacy for you and the one on the plot next door. Very crowded and noisy."
96281,1396253,4,kty31,02/08/2021,Very correct campsite. The river next to it or apparently you can swim. Next to the campsite a restaurant bar. Very well located. Small but shaded plot. Friendly welcome.
96281,1326045,4,SteKohler,15/07/2021,"Very nice sanitary facilities. It is not far to the city on foot. The plots are small, as is usual on a city campsite. However, it is very quiet. There are shady trees everywhere. I would come back."
96281,1303066,1,laura1981carlos,07/07/2021,"Camping to avoid, it has nothing good! For one night it is passable, small pitches and outdated showers and toilets, the only good thing is the location since you can walk to the old town"
96281,1298603,4,Miren89,05/07/2021,"Very good overall! Although the pitches are not too big, we with a Camper were great. The campsite is small but very cozy. We pay for a small pitch 2 adults and 1 girl (free) € 24. Very clean and large showers. The center of Logroño is just 10 minutes walking and the municipal swimming pools another 10. We have had a great weekend!"

96281,1274537,4,Remolin,24/06/2021,"Camping a few minutes from the center, next to the Ebro river. The staff is very friendly and easily located us despite being a large motorhome. Recommended to visit Logroño and its famous tapas bars"
96281,1272887,4,Salvana3,23/06/2021,Quiet and that is a 10 min walk from the center. the people who run them very nice. spacious and clean bathrooms. easily accessible plots next to the jetty and the large park so places to walk and have a drink very close. does not have a store only vending

96281,974605,4,benyalerta,17/08/2020,"Good facilities, perfect to visit Logroño, next to the municipal swimming pool of Logroño, which is the best I've seen. Special prices for the pool if you are staying in it. I'm not giving it five stars because they should be more careful about people wearing the mask."
96281,702964,4,Vandiamo,24/09/2019,Excellent site right by the river 10 mins from centre. We were too large to access normal bays but they accommodated us in car park with electricity.  Very helpful & friendly staff. Lovely sanitation

96281,655898,4,moldym,24/08/2019,Great little spot. Smallish spaces but clean and well maintained. You have to get there in good time as not many spaces and wasn’t possible to book in ac since. I arrived around 6pm.
96281,579994,4,NuriaFC,27/07/2019,"It is a campsite that is very well located. The phenomenal attention waited for us because we were a little late. The small plot, and clean bathrooms. There is a barbecue area and very cool tables too."

96281,405534,4,rogerlepoidevin,07/11/2018,Nice clean quiet campsite in early Oct. Amazing sani-block! Helpful reception staff. 24 euro for van without elec. Very handy for walking access across the river to the old town. We walked to the Ijalba winery for a superb tour and tasting.

96293,2605969,1,FrancescoGiuseppe,11/03/2023,"Bad directions aside, this place is ideal if you want to wake up at dawn, as the fishermen arrive early and are noisy. Attention it is full of mosquitoes both at sunset and in the morning."
96293,2492351,5,tanix81,12/11/2022,place right next to the lagoon! at dawn you can hear the fishermen! beautiful at night!
96293,2215940,4,BeaFelipe,11/08/2022,"Dirt road and parking. Small car park like 4/5 spaces, at the beginning of a path for walking and cycling, next to the water. The site is very very beautiful, we were the only van. In the morning the area is very busy with fishermen and all the walkers in the area."

96293,397795,3,Fishovertheroad,23/10/2018,Good for one night. Quiet area full of fish (for fishing lovers). A little passage but not disturbing. The place is a bit dirty. Remember to pick up your garbage.
96325,3258327,4,Nicoro,04/09/2023,"You can park every day, the market does not occupy this parking lot."
96325,3227531,5,MiriVan8,27/08/2023,"It is flat enough. Except on Wednesday and Saturday mornings when there is a market, the rest of the days it is an excellent option. We have visited this town several times, it is very beautiful."

96325,1409766,4,juliomanuel,05/08/2021,"I spent tonight in this parking lot, the night was very quiet. Unfortunately when I woke up, some unscrupulous person, with a camper or motorhome who has spent the night there, has left a trace of their passage in the form of waste. If we do not show respect for the environment, in the end it will prohibit us from spending the night in many places."
96327,1534086,3,Vitopower,31/08/2021,"Good place near the road but at the same time hidden, flat and with a very cool river just 100 meters away. The pity is that some have taken it as a clean point and there are several pieces of furniture thrown away, not to mention who does not collect their garbage or excrete in the middle of the road."
96328,3200631,5,atokirina,22/08/2023,"Perfect, tranquil spot for a few days, but be aware that any car bigger than a T4 will get scratched! bad road too! 
Take your trash with you please :)"
96328,3040496,4,Slickepinne,29/07/2023,"Quiet area with easy access to the water. Lots of trash though, including a fridge. The access was okay but there'll definitely be some scratches. Only for campers/cars and not big motorhomes."
96328,2600143,5,TheWOWTravels,05/03/2023,"Quiet and lonely place with direct access to the water. Access by track in very good condition, the only drawback is some low tree. Campers only."
96328,2093250,5,tono76,19/07/2022,"a very quiet place, up to 4 motorhomes, the entrance from the road is 3km, be careful that there are many olive trees and they scratch the motorhome, going down to the water is a hill but it goes down well, and you sleep in luxury, the air runs, no get dirty so that they don't forbid pecnotar"
96328,1986248,5,Allan35,17/06/2022,"We spent one night, quiet and flat place. We went through the path with our motorhome (obviously light scratches because of the olive trees) But the setting is top!"
96328,1936542,5,peoplecalled,01/06/2022,Incredibly great place! But the approach is really very narrow and cannot be reached without scratches. So nothing for rental campers or road surfers.
96328,1890873,5,Red.Vantures,15/05/2022,"Probably the most beautiful place we ever stayed !
!! please, keep this place clean !!
pick up your toilet paper, take your trash with you and preserve this beauty !!! we cleaned this place (even other peoples toilet paper) and if you see any trash, don't be silly: pick it up and take it with you..
only this way we can all keep enjoying these   wonderful and amazing places."
96328,1813338,4,GuillePatry,10/04/2022,Charming place! Small esplanade to be able to leave the camper. Too bad it was very windy and we had to leave after a while. highly recommended
96328,1790147,5,Poudredescampette,21/03/2022,"Bivouac spot with an incredible view! The access is not very wide because of the branches of the olive trees, but for a small vehicle it is perfect."
96328,1722278,5,ObjetivoCamper,01/01/2022,"Spectacular. It is a perfect van in every rule (if you can get there) The dirt and stone road is very narrow with olive trees on both sides and the branches scrape the sides of the vehicle. I don't think a motorhome can pass. we with great volume have ""suffered"" a little. but it is definitely worth it."
96328,1694139,5,babsihe,20/11/2021,"Perfect place to stay, but it was a bit windy on the platform. We put us to sleep in the forest, sheltered by trees. It was completely quiet that night. Road is easy to drive on. Really great !!"
96328,1653633,4,ex365,20/10/2021,Nice place. The access is without four-wheel drive but you shouldn't drive anything bigger than a van. It was a bit windy at night when we got up early but a dream when the sun comes up. Far and wide nobody disturbs you.
96328,1652445,5,dogan1971,19/10/2021,"If there would be 6 starts I would add. Excellent, clean, nice view, quiet. Keep it this way"
96328,1289367,4,Celita.candela,01/07/2021,"The place is beautiful, the road is quite long about 3.5 km from the road, but it is true that it is worth it, we spent a night completely alone, and we bathed in the swamp ... as always, footprints of people who do not collect their rubbish ... otherwise spectacular."
96328,1100561,4,AaronGutierrez,20/10/2020,The place is worth it. Full views of the swamp and total tranquility. The only bad thing that the last 1.5km is a narrow path with olive branches that come to the road and can produce rallones.
96328,724657,4,theroverlanders,18/10/2019,It was slightly narrow with low branches but we made it in our 4x4 and had a peaceful night with one other car.
96332,3167840,1,campervan2289,17/08/2023,It is our first time here and we will not sleep. Both the parking and the beach are full of unbearable flies because of the decomposing algae. The smell is  disgusting.
96332,3076174,5,CyrilCampingCar,04/08/2023,"Magnificent view of the beach and the ocean. Several places where to settle. Spend the day, not the night"
96332,2965031,1,julisalilounina,14/07/2023,Nice but too many campers have taken their ease… fired by the police and the rather aggressive locals.

96332,1557400,1,therealcamper,07/09/2021,Not recommendable !!! The police clear the place in the evening. Also aggressive fishermen who are very unfriendly.
96332,1455509,4,Yvette23,14/08/2021,"It is fine although access by areas is complicated It is only to spend the day, there is no service and be careful with Sleeping because they are fined"

96332,941949,5,urtula,09/08/2020,Very quiet night. about 10 vans and camper parked. the police did not pass. Very nice place but it can get windy.
96332,939185,1,snulkite,08/08/2020,"Nice view, but ... prohibited in the camp: in August the police dislodge you in the middle of the night ... very cold place in the evening if the thermal summer wind is established, in short, there is better not far away"
96332,938711,1,fluoxo,08/08/2020,Great view but we've been eject by the police... I don't recommend it.
96332,938684,1,BastienPERRAUD,08/08/2020,Magnificent spot! But the cops see the trucks at night!
96332,923301,5,Ariadna84,02/08/2020,"Very well, the only thing to access with AC you have to be careful if you have the bass very low, there are ""bumps"". A 5-minute walk along roads to the north is a seafood wholesaler that sells cooked seafood to go."
96332,787088,5,padaddy,26/02/2020,"Superb spot! wild horses roaming around and i was lucky enough to see dolphins playing in the surf! Don't follow Google maps, it takes you past the road to the praia..."
96332,774580,5,jaegerin,31/01/2020,Very nice quiet place in nature. Unfortunately the access road had a lot of large puddles of water so that we didn't drive to the actual place. Still recommended!
96332,735498,5,Sophieee,01/11/2019,Loved this place so much - utterly beautiful! We surfed one day but the waves are inconsistent this time of year. Stayed for three nights. Couldn’t find any facilities which is ok - leave no trace!
96332,711787,5,cheers123,03/10/2019,"Fantastic place we have 7m van and no problem on approach, like other previous comments use satellite view to get here, one other van here"
96332,671842,4,mvina,01/09/2019,"Very quiet place The access is a dirt track. Google maps does not take you to the parking lot, you have to turn right in the middle of the town and then take the track, in the satellite view it looks perfectly."
96332,670879,5,taniazapata,31/08/2019,"The site is great for the vans! the location is not quite right !!! You have to get in a little vanilla a little earlier, as well as land!"
96332,668590,5,seb64600,30/08/2019,"Awesome. you have to park at the end and not in the dunes, it's forbidden. the civil guardia cleared me. I did not have a fine."

96332,619569,5,Exo5,11/08/2019,"Simply superb! 750m of track to access it but it's worth it. The track is not very wide, so rather for vans. Dustbin available, flat area made of grass and sand. Pontoon stairs to go down to the beach without damaging the dune."
96332,533419,4,Christel82,30/06/2019,"Access is not recommended or impossible for long motorhomes. Ours is 7.5 m: impossible climb. If in doubt, leave the vehicle at the bottom and walk around."
96332,520245,5,stevecosta,18/06/2019,"Fantastic views, no other vans here. Beautiful beaches just a short distance down the steps, no water nor showersn but there are two bins, one non-recycable and one recyclable, which is great. Difficult to find though, I went into satellite view on google maps which shows the access road better."
96332,509096,5,eliko,09/06/2019,"Wonderful place! During the day there were many bathers, at night there were very few campers distributed. And everyone could enjoy his"
96332,504794,5,saralala,05/06/2019,"A superb place. We stayed there for two nights. Right by the sea, beautiful beach, it surfs by moment. There is no service in this season, no shower, no toilet, no trash. These installations seem to be on the parking lot opposite. The access is frankly not so complicated as we could read it. The place is very quiet (May), two or three vans stay there by night. Perfect !"

Many cars and motorcycles pass by but it is not a problem because at night practically no cars pass and it is covered with the sound of Del Mar. The problem was that around 2 in the morning two hooded men started banging on our door and we even had to knock to the police because we didn't dare go out. 2 patrols came

Not a wide, open plan car park, but a little road leading to gravel stands with full camper services available and little paths leading through the gardens. Central chill out area provided for use by all."

Thanks very much!"
96477,2894864,1,Angel425,26/06/2023,"06/16/23: I have gone to this place guided by the presentation, photos and comments that appear and what is my surprise, when I find a place in a state of abandonment, the field and parking lots could be improved, the power outlets subject to a small wooden trunk without any protection and the cables crossing in sight and without protection through the rolling areas, the gravel surface leveled and leveled, well nothing at all, thick stones with edges that could puncture a wheel. I did not use the bathrooms (because of the bad appearance of the place), on the other hand, indications that are not understood and poorly painted on pieces of rotten chipboard and thrown among the vegetation and finally when I pay the next day, I ask Invoice or supporting ticket to the owner and the answer is that they do not make invoices. While in Portugal, in Park4night (the place) it appeared as (Aguas Vivas) and now (a week later) the name that appears is (S.Teotonio,N120). For all of the above, I do not recommend this place, except for a moment of trouble. Greetings."
96477,2878780,5,RalfGessner,21/06/2023,"Highly Recommended. Warm welcome and great tips for secluded beaches, which are a few kilometers away. It's worth a visit! I was definitely not here for the last time..."

Thomas and Roswitha - Jolie and Lotti"
96477,2631364,5,Snowpark,30/03/2023,"Very friendly operators who sometimes go on vacation with their camper van themselves. Representation during this time is just as cordial.

It's just a pity that Alwin and his wife were out and about with the camper themselves during our stay, but maybe it will work out next time."

96477,2538650,3,ThomasKrebs,02/01/2023,"I would have liked to have stayed much longer, but the barking of the dogs in the area was too annoying. That's why I'm deducting one star for the dogs and one star for the weak wifi. Maybe places in general should think about Starlink. I found Alvin to be very nice and helpful and the bathroom with shower is great."

Unfortunately we could not sleep well because various dogs in the neighborhood barked all the time (for hours) at the beginning of the night, which was very annoying. It was also tedious that a camper arrived at 11 p.m. and lit up and drove around. I would recommend a gate or something similar that arrival is no longer possible so late."

The only improvement I would suggest is to add more trees. Attention: The GPS coordinates are a bit off and the place is called Aguas Vivas (so just follow the signs). Its a house surrounded by a very high cedar fence.

It is not pleasant to take a shower in the morning or in the evening. However, the water was super hot and the sanitary facilities were very clean. Supply and final disposal of the mobile home is very, very cumbersome. Toilet disposal is also not the best solution. Everything a little awkward with the garden hoses. But everything is there and doable and we felt really comfortable for three days. But that's enough for this place. For the drafty shower and the nocturnal disturbance of dogs, two stars deduction."

96478,1970838,5,Raquelycarlos,12/06/2022,cool. We came first thing in the morning. It was empty just 3 more motorhomes. You have the beach next to it with a beach bar.
96478,1398221,5,JoseMiguelbetoret,03/08/2021,"There are actually two car parks. one of land that is accessed facing the sea (before the cafeteria) and a later one with a much larger and level lawn and that is accessed from the side, after the cafeteria."
96478,944830,3,Catalina19,09/08/2020,"Near chiringuitos. You cannot camp, the civil guard passed by telling us that we keep chairs and tables, people with more things outside, they were directly fined. you can no longer spend the night."
96478,943154,3,Catalina19,09/08/2020,"Site easily accessible from the road, on land, quite level, in front of La Lanzada beach, without services, they charge € 3 per night but we have been told that as of today they will no longer allow us to stay overnight, seprona has prohibited it."
96478,941439,5,Bombero,08/08/2020,Today the guys who collect the donation for parking told us that tomorrow is the last day that we will be able to park here. SEPRONA forces them to close the parking lot. A pity because it is a luxury place but from what I have seen some do not understand what it means that you cannot camp.
96478,939088,4,juanot,08/08/2020,"Spacious and next to the beach. We arrived at 22:00. € 3. They have a code in case you want to go out. ATTENTION: in the morning, in addition to the baker, the civil guard passed by and, although by now we should know the difference between parking and camping, there are people who do not understand it ... there were 3 cars setting up their own camp ... REMOVE NOTHING !!! .... The GC took note of them ... evidently."
96478,928388,3,Escu,04/08/2020,"Quiet and flat place. It has picnic tables. They charge you a € 3 donation for the football club, it is next to the football field. the beach la lanzada is next door, just cross the road."
96478,922235,4,Maikyco,02/08/2020,"Ample, flat land with several picnic tables. Next to the Lanzada beach. Some guys passed by explaining to us that we had to make a donation of 3 euros for the football team. They give ticket. They close the access at night and open it early in the morning but if you have to leave before they open, they give you the opening combination. No services."
96478,913038,5,Curry123,30/07/2020,"Perfect place, donation of €3 that we paid without hesitation, during the night it closes with a chain, picnic tables to eat. We spent two nights and we will return without hesitation. Of course, as there are discrepancies over the ownership of the land, said by the civil guard, the bad comments seen here are not very trustworthy. You cannot remove tables or awnings, obviously."
96478,910996,5,LANZADA,30/07/2020,Spectacular

Level grass field just across the road from the beach and just €3 per night. Well worth the money."
96478,880361,4,Rutina,19/07/2020,"We spent two super quiet nights, it is worth paying 3 euros to get what you want. The other parking lots have better views but they are parking lots as is."
96478,862994,2,chetenesy,12/07/2020,"Very well located and level place, they allow you to remove furniture and open windows for € 3. the bad thing that at 4 am some kids start throwing firecrackers. It seems suspicious to me that someone comes out with firecrackers and lasts until that time, I say this because here I read that there is a conflict over the ownership of the farm between the football club and the community of mountains that does not want cars .... there I leave."
96478,861093,4,luzpartner,11/07/2020,There are plenty of parking spaces and the ground is level. small beach bar and beach showers. I haven't spent the night.

96478,359474,2,MarioMoreira,30/08/2018,"I stayed one night at the beginning of August 2018, a quiet night, but I did not go through the space. Motorhomes and caravans with open awnings and chairs, an individual circulated among caravans and apparently solved problems of water supply. Something consfuso. I went in and out and no one bothered me."

96489,3252795,5,JanRF,03/09/2023,"A charming place, you can hear the noise of the river all the time which is beautiful and you wake up with very beautiful views. There are no people around and it is not far from the road. Watch out for slugs?"

96489,1647563,3,fiatdoblomaxi,16/10/2021,Quiet and super nice corner. 2 caveats: railway line above and national road on the other side. Convenient to sleep before going to Andorra

Despite this its a good spot"

96489,996058,5,orewil,23/08/2020,Great place in nature and alone. By the river to soak your feet because too much current for swimming. We loved it. I highly recommend it.
96489,968289,4,TaniaetPili,16/08/2020,"Great place to rest. A little isolated place, perfect to let go of the dog and where pn is sure to be alone. The current noise is very loud, but the view is worth it."
96489,838161,4,SIMS6,27/06/2020,"Good quiet spot, not far from the road. 1 location only. On the other side of the bridge near the road there is a house belonging to an association for young people with large concrete parking lot with the possibility of settling down for free with the agreement of the owners who are very friendly."

96504,2207826,4,Pitididi,10/08/2022,Do not park too close to the small path because during the night the few cars that passed had fun honking their horns. Place however pleasant with a nice view and a clock surrounded by pottoks.

96504,1316970,3,ALX667,12/07/2021,"Nice place. The surrounding reservoirs do not offer bathing facilities. If it wasn't on the way, I wouldn't go back up. Lots of tight switchbacks."
96504,1181908,3,Moleta82,29/04/2021,"The place is beautiful and at night we sleep soundly, but during the day there is a lot of noise. From 6:50 am, trucks from the lumber industries, motorcycles, 4x4 vehicles continually pass by. Trucks come and go all morning laden with logs, making a lot of noise and filling everything with dust ... We had a shaky awakening."

96566,3249904,1,davidgp,02/09/2023,"The local police have passed by warning of the regulations and that they are going to report, in fact they have reported a motorhome that was next to me for having something outside, windows and door open and slippers outside the door. For me, quite right. The place is very nice but people do not respect the rules....and especially since there is a campsite 100 meters away, you have to have a bit of a view."
96566,3068545,4,mary41,03/08/2023,"Secure parking. Beach right next to the car and a small daily fee in season (~2.50€). At night, however, it was rather noisy due to posers and a lot of traffic."
96566,2820015,4,Festin,04/06/2023,"Area very close to the beautiful beach, better if there is space in the streets in front, the main one a bit noisy. I imagine that in an impossible season, it is a time zone from June to September, and there are many summer homes."
96566,2664387,4,RM73,12/04/2023,"Very nice place to spend the night and walk to Cambrils, 20 minutes along the seafront. Quite busy road, but did not bother us. We stayed one night safely"
96566,2628551,5,rikenlisa,28/03/2023,Great Night sleep. parking is right at the beach and the whole neighbourhood around it. A lot of campers in March but very quiet and a lot of space. The Road was very quiet

96566,2515279,5,patou241,07/12/2022,"Good spot where you can park without problem in this season, located in a back alley there is less immediate passage and it is wide enough even for large CCs. Obviously a bit noisy."
96566,2506087,5,Lem0nade,26/11/2022,"Great spot right across from a lovely sandy beach which is perfect for swimming, walking and sun baking. There were no toilets near this spot as the closest one was closed and the other was over 1.5kms up the beach. Also no showers in this location, only further up the beach. There is quite a lot of traffic but this eases off during the night. Overall a great spot if you know what to expect."

96566,2489440,3,EricBruvel,10/11/2022,"Ideal for the beach, nice setting, nice view, but noisy. Permanent passage of cars, buses, trucks, etc. Parking under streetlights and I think safe."

96566,2303977,4,JosePardo,26/08/2022,The full day for €2.25 and a free night. 50 meters from the beach. We stayed 2 days and without any problem. The only drawback is that the road is close but it is not a big problem.
96566,2188034,4,gaizkapana,07/08/2022,"We were there to spend the day at the beach and without problems. There is plenty of parking space and also, wherever you park, you have the beach across the street. Good place to use it on the go and enjoy a little crowded beach"

96566,2034003,5,kikiya,03/07/2022,In high season it is not worth wandering around to find a place in the free area. The paid area is €2.25 all day and there is more space. The park next door is fine to take the dog out (and pick up his stuff)
96566,1874606,3,toni60,07/05/2022,"yes it is a great place for these dates but it is incomprehensible that there are people who dare to take their loved ones out to lie on the lawn, then when they prohibit us from parking we will say that the town hall is such and such, embarrassing for some"

96566,1858650,5,Mintxu,28/04/2022,"You can see parked campers and motorhomes practically all year round. When we saw them, we decided to spend the night in this parking lot. The local road is close but it didn't bother us too much. Outside high season parking is free."
96566,1699358,4,McGnomus,28/11/2021,"A good area to spend a night or two. Now in winter there was little going on and the side streets were pleasantly quiet - and parking is completely free. The police drove by and stopped for a moment, but didn't speak to us in the two days. It can get very windy, right here by the sea."

It is an orange zone (€ 2.50 for 24 hours) but only from June to September 30, the beach very close, with showers but no other services, it is highly advisable to go through the center of town and eat in one of its good restaurants."

Bike path that borders Cambrils (about 7 km). Very suitable if you want to spend a couple of days walking or beach. There is a toilet and showers on the beach right in that area. Yes there is some traffic but you can sleep. There is also a shaded lawn area.

96566,1438314,4,gorkaikutza,11/08/2021,"A very quiet place to sleep, the perfect place with the sound of cars: next to the beach, with 10 other motorhomes and paying 2.25 euros for sleeping all day here. Recommended !!"
96566,1372475,3,Monteanu,27/07/2021,"Area by the sea and an extensive park with grass. Street very busy with vehicles, difficult to sleep. The curfew helped us to be able to sleep. Recommended if you are one of those who sleeps soundly. No services."
96566,1297123,5,xagami,04/07/2021,"Recommended, now in summer a little noise until midnight but a great location"
96566,1202581,5,thewaywestray,16/05/2021,Really good spot for a night! 50 meter from the beach and free in the low season.

96566,855006,4,TiesosMojameros,08/07/2020,Quiet and silent ample parking. It is very close to the beach which has showers. Dogs are not allowed.
96566,840884,3,xavierfarras,29/06/2020,Free until July! the surrounding streets a little more free interiors. little shade. good place to go to the beach. Vilafortuny is calmer than Cambrils and much more than Salou. there is a walk with a cycle path that connects them.
96566,719504,3,pugscaniche6,12/10/2019,"Nice setting, sea at 50 meters, park on the other side BUT very noisy with the non-stop passing cars day and night damage ...."

96566,632015,5,vane82210,15/08/2019,Excellent location to spend the day and even sleep at night. We paid $ 2.25 a day and were parked in front of the beach. There was only to cross the street. In the evening after asking a policewoman in the day we could unfold a table and eat in the grass next to the sidewalk. At night there are cars passing but that did not stop us from sleeping. We arrived Sunday around 11am. There was a lot of people but from Monday the car park was deserted. Only car campsites!
96566,617340,5,Romelia,11/08/2019,"Very good location to spend the day at the beach. We arrived Sunday around 9am, plenty of places available."
96566,595235,4,Momonessi,03/08/2019,Great site They don't give you any fault. In this area the cars are well received. We have paid € 2.25 for being all day. The night is very noisy due to continuous traffic. Better to spend the night in an area that is a few streets above and return in the morning. Lawn area in front of the car where you can eat on the towel. Are there showers. We will repeat!
96566,518246,4,LaBichaneta,17/06/2019,"Parking Orange Zone (Pay only in summer) in a road of the main street. Hopefully you can catch shadow areas, next to a lawn where you can be with the dog. It is located at a pedestrian crossing of the beach and being parked with the raised ceiling passed both Mossos and PL and did not put any hits. For the night it is better to go around the block and to be placed in the perpendicular street, since we will avoid to a great extent the possible noise of the main street and in addition this zone is not of payment (White)"
96566,505632,5,PierdeElNorte,06/06/2019,"Very calm. Right in front of the beach. The cars go by a little, but it's very good. People hardly pass at night"
96566,482343,4,Katiova,12/05/2019,"It is a parking lot in front of the beach with beautiful views. In low season you do not have to pay, from June 1 and until September 30, you pay € 2.25 daily. It is fine although being a parking lot has no services. Some squares are under trees that protect from heat. I think that in high season the noise of cars passing through the main street can disturb at night."
96566,447939,4,Keithnangie,02/04/2019,"Great place to stay off-season, no parking charges. Quiet at night with only occasional traffic. Nice walk along the seafront into town."

96566,361748,2,GaeCateSara,01/09/2018,"We spent a night there without problems (except for the noise of traffic that is a lot) but unfortunately in the afternoon, while we were on the beach in front, they broke the door and took away a tablet and a phone. So ... Warning!"
96566,359076,3,malliz,29/08/2018,"Stayed 27th and 28th september 2018. 2.25 for full day right through till nrxt again day. 50 metres to beautiful sandy beach with fresh water showers and toilet
 chiringuitos close. The location is perfect but the noise through the night from cars and vans racing along the road will wake you up. Bring ear plugs and you are sorted here. spar supermarket 5 minute walk away. police passed lots too"

96579,1369651,4,DavidCuentamas,27/07/2021,Spacious near the beach and the promenade. The only bad thing is when in the morning the parade of trucks begins to collect garbage from the containers.
96579,1353087,4,leonesjose,22/07/2021,"We have parked and met many motorhomes who have known the site for many years. Very reliable and safe. I recommend eating at a restaurant on the seafront called the King of Paella, very varied in fried fish and assorted dishes, good service and speed. On the same beach at the end of the street where you park there are public showers. FREE but there is a gorilla."
96579,368724,3,betita82,09/09/2018,We have parked without problem. Free.
96614,2081054,2,Basile56,16/07/2022,".Possibility to land along the small road for an afternoon or a night. it is shaded so nice to have some shade. On the other hand, swimming is almost impossible, in any case it does not make you want to. And there's no point in going all the way around if not to burn diesel. The best spots are at the beginning, and the state of the road is very average so going around is long and without interest."
96614,2078684,3,lotte0495,16/07/2022,"We spend the night here. We parked just at the entrance of the way around the lake. Unfortunately it’s a place where a lot of people are walking their dog or just have their evening walk. So in terms of privacy, you don’t really have much. But during the night it was all quiet and nice."
96614,912787,4,kiki-49,30/07/2020,"No worries about access by van, but stones placed at the entrance to the road reduce the width to around 2.2 m. Lots of places to hang out along the road (if it's broke). There is even a small area accessible for swimming 5-10 minutes away by following the road along the lake. No service but calm and a little cool in the event of a heat wave."
96614,726819,1,seb208,21/10/2019,"Sadly, there is a rock on the side of the road making it too narrow for us to pass and get to the spot."
96614,665321,3,Cleve,28/08/2019,"We went a little further down the road. Small road that runs along the lake, crossed only a few walkers. Nice to spend the night, swimming so brave to go down the coast a bit steep."
96614,516000,5,marionmaximelovevan,15/06/2019,Too handsome !
96615,1048736,3,kiebra,14/09/2020,"A parking lot in the middle of the town is a bit inclined, you have coverage, and you are near the Otzarreta halledo. Containers nearby, with no other services."
96623,3224881,5,LeOlaMartin,27/08/2023,"Idyllic place with a unique view. You have your own toilet with shower, use of the kitchen & the number of places is very limited, so you didn't really have a campsite flair. We felt very comfortable. Petra & Seetha also give tips for some hikes and trips to quintas. Our companion slept in one of the Mongolian yurts with an open roof - a highlight!"
96623,2694562,5,ChristianBorrmann,24/04/2023,We spent two nights at this idyllic campsite. The owners gave us such a warm welcome and showed us around their property. Due to the small spaces we were given our own shower/toilet. The places are designed more for minibuses. Bread service possible. House wine available (delicious) Many thanks to Petra and her husband for this campsite
96623,2416499,5,marjanvanhethooft,01/10/2022,"Super nice place, beautiful area, nice owners! It may take a while, but we would love to come back to this gem in the Douro! Regards, marjan vh hooft"
96623,2329941,2,basias,01/09/2022,beautiful view. probably a very good campsite. were sent away because we wanted to stay 1 night instead of 2. while they did have room. sorry I would like to know.
96623,1286051,5,kogoyo84,29/06/2021,"Great place, great owners, great wine, great facilities, great all. Nothing else to add."
96623,1223595,5,BiRe,29/05/2021,"A perfect place for a few days off. Very kind and helpful owners. A little paradise in the vineyard.
Narrow way through Alcarias can be avoided by using unpaved road directly from N101, but have to turn in front of the entrance then.
Small turn areas limit RV length to 6m, narrow ways not suitable for >2.10m width.
Limited ressources, phone before!"
96623,1046915,1,lanjana,13/09/2020,"Spaniards are not welcome. We wanted to sleep and the conversation has not gone beyond that they only speak English, which would not be a problem. Without asking if we were coming to the campsite or cabins, he told us that everything was complete, seeing from the top, you can see everything (vineyard terraces) and we have not seen anything but a store. FULL poster is appreciated at the beginning of the horrible track for not climbing"
96623,909320,5,zozo3005,29/07/2020,"We stayed with a small sized camper van and made sure to book in advance, as there are actually not many dedicated spaces. Please note that access is a little difficult (dirt road and steep, sloping bends once in the campsite). The area is beautiful and very pleasant in summer (very cool despite the overwhelming heat of the surroundings). The toilets are clean and the hosts really warm. I absolutely recommend this campsite."
96623,638001,5,ls253,17/08/2019,"Paradies! This spot is amazing! We stayed there for two nights and were glad that we decided to come here. Owners are super friendly, location is breathtaking, bathrooms clean and beautiful, short walks to village and small waterfall. We payed 24€/ Camper Van +2 people. Not a normal camping, more some spot in the middle of a vinyard. Make sure to call ahead, just google the number. The place is on a side road/dirt track, the road to the house quite steep. Anything bigger than a VW Camper Van will probably have problems to fit, a big caravan will have no possibilty to turn. Only few spots for Vans, rest is for small cars + tents. So make sure to check ahead!"
96623,559641,5,Willi_der_Camper,17/07/2019,"Small private campsite in the middle of the vineyards. Super nice view, very nice reception and very clean toilets. The approach is a bit bumpy and not necessarily suitable for campers. It was perfect for our little van"
96623,528747,4,wearehere,25/06/2019,"Great place, beautiful scenery in a little vineyard! Nice view, nice neighbourhood to walk or tour around and great restaurants close by. Not cheap though.. Clean toilet building!"

96625,1581023,5,Erwtje,15/09/2021,"Great place, quiet and easily accessible, even with a large camper, ID very nice view over the sea, cave not found and it remains a pity that others leave so much rubbish, even a dog does not soil its own nest (take your rubbish with you! !!) so that others can enjoy it too."
96625,1264619,1,Paul_and_friends,19/06/2021,"Between Baiona and A Guarda there are definitely 20 parking spaces directly on the coast. This one is by far the worst ... Narrow spaces, uneven and in addition you are in direct line of sight from some houses to the Atlantic. I cannot recommend the place."
96625,1254208,4,Diego21,14/06/2021,"Ample parking for camper, in a spectacular area by the sea. As a bad part, the descent to the sea is through rocks."

96648,906422,4,Wichiland,28/07/2020,Very quiet to spend the night. Very interesting to visit the castle (free). Craftswomen display their work and sell in the different rooms of the castle. there are free guided tours in the village (info in the castle)
96648,678596,5,nathalieperez,06/09/2019,Super quiet place to spend the night. There are no services. We stop here because on the coast it was very windy and we are on our way to Ferrol.
96648,605389,3,luvain,06/08/2019,"We asked the gym worker who is near and another of the castle in the same town and they told us that we could stay in this place without problems. We did that. We were alone and well. I put 3 stars for not having any service, not for anything else."

96650,2581518,3,firecampervan,18/02/2023,Prohibited overnight. Perfect for visiting the monastery. Empty first thing in the morning. Then it's time to wait to be able to leave with the motorhome.
96650,1601725,5,anagfcastillo,23/09/2021,"Parking of the Piedra monastery. You cannot stay overnight, they clearly indicate it. The motorhomes fit, although we have left ours on a cord, the battery stood out too much. We have made the visit with a 4-month-old dog: beware that there is an area of the park with many narrow, steep and slippery stairs. Our dog didn't want to lower them. The park is beautiful, we loved it."
96650,1359068,2,Remolin,24/07/2021,Ground parking where you can leave the motorhome while visiting the surroundings of the Stone Monastery.

96650,494089,1,Papagomas,27/05/2019,No more parking with prohibition of overnight to access the tourists of the Monastery. A theft that to visit a natural space charge € 16 per adult and € 11 to children aged 4 years. Until never Stone.
