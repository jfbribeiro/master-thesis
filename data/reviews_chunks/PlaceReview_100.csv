6411,3287492,3,OlaCamperlife,12/09/2023,"Having read all the comments about the robberies in Lisboa, we decided to leave the camper parked inside the camping just for a day: from around 9:30 to 20:00 it costs 13,20 euros. All good and safe. Easy to get to the center by bus or uber."
6411,3281404,4,OzCar816,10/09/2023,"Stayed here with dog for 2 nights at the end of August. Parking space ok with electricity and water, sanitary facilities OK and great pool. Ok, the noise level in the evening due to a concert was decent, but it ended around 11 p.m. The mini market is an expensive joke and the abandoned caravans and tattered tents further back in the park are creepy. Unfortunately, green areas are not particularly well maintained."
6411,3269928,4,IPP80,07/09/2023,"The plots were good, we didn't like the restaurant for dinner at all. The campsite for what it is, was expensive. And it could improve on cleanliness."
6411,3267859,5,Ragnar007,07/09/2023,"Great place to park while visiting Lisbon.Everything you need. Plenty of space, water and electricity at every pitch . Bus into the centre frequent Number 714 . pitch costs 40 euros"
6411,3258336,3,majaluisebastian,04/09/2023,"Were booked here for two nights. Unfortunately we found that the place was under a tree with lots of pigeons... There was a lot of excrement on everything... The showers were clean but very, very run down. Pool was closed...then left on the second day, refund was not possible according to the staff, who weren't particularly friendly either. Unfortunately the only campsite"
6411,3247316,4,MathildeCC,01/09/2023,"Reading the reviews, we were afraid of finding a bad campsite. But we were pleasantly surprised. It was very clean, we paid 35€ for 2 people van. The road is certainly close, but we easily found a remote location, and the sound of the cicadas covered everything. Uber 10€ to go to the center of Lisbon."
6411,3245555,4,Westalfaia64,01/09/2023,"Good campsite, pleasant pitches, clean toilets. A little pricey but we are in Lisbon!! Small problem encountered: the presence of a few cockroaches at night... and hornets during the day... Otherwise very good"
6411,3245452,5,gallonski,01/09/2023,"Excellent. Quiet, new and very clean facilities, impeccable restaurant, pool, I give it a 9 out of 10. The only thing that would improve would be the identification of pitches for campers M, N and A, it costs to find them, it must be said that it is huge. The rest of the letters well identified. For the rest fabulous"
6411,3243329,3,Aitzi666,31/08/2023,"Perfect for spending two nights exploring Lisbon, as it has a very good connection with the center by bus and also with Sintra by train, but compared to other campsites in Portugal it is very expensive and quite noisy (the road, planes, a concert venue nearby...). The infrastructure is adequate. The bar and restaurant are also expensive."
6411,3242044,3,kolap,31/08/2023,The food at the campsite was the most horrible thing I've ever experienced in Portugal.
6411,3234721,3,StefanHauck,29/08/2023,"Good starting point for a visit to Lisbon. Sanitary is good and clean, camper pitches are assigned, water, electricity, dishwashing facilities on site. A bit expensive, €50/night for three people, parking space, electricity (flat rate)."
6411,3233628,3,vanlavie,29/08/2023,"Convenient campsite for visiting Lisbon with swimming pool football pitch, we had a good pitch on hard ground and a picnic table. The only fault with this campsite are the very small showers that are impractical because they are small and require little maintenance, and the mini-market where there is very little food."
6411,3216149,5,czemicha,25/08/2023,Water service without staying in the campsite costs EUR 8.10. Not bad considering we were not able to find any alternative in Lisbon
6411,3213370,3,Eugezena,24/08/2023,"good welcome but if you cannot find accommodation in the numbered pitches it is necessary to adapt to areas that are also very inclined and with the need for very long electricity cables. the camper service area is good but the services are not up to par and in some cases dirty washrooms, in general poorly maintained. Unfortunately there are no alternatives."
6411,3209240,2,davidemoretti73,24/08/2023,"Very neglected camping pitches with insects of all kinds (cockroaches, ants, bedbugs) small and not level. The reception girls are always very annoyed by your presence. Swimming pool ok. I don't know if there are alternatives to visit Lisbon"
6411,3208005,3,Fuchsloch,23/08/2023,"Connection to Lisbon Centrum Top. Saturday and Sunday, depending on the pitch, very loud music from the neighboring hotel until 11:15 p.m. Sanitary facilities partly very dilapidated and mostly not clean (no soaps are refilled either). All in all, a shame about the beautiful place that has long since passed its heyday."
6411,3199048,4,Inmafv,22/08/2023,"We have only entered for the emptying and filling of water. The price for these services is €8.10. For this service I had four positions and they are comfortable to use. The campsite looked good, with many users."
6411,3195451,1,pitineetdoudou,21/08/2023,Icy reception I was barely said hello. I turned around and preferred to go elsewhere
6411,3193720,1,BeninLo,21/08/2023,"Very bad reception. We couldn't sleep there, we were told in a very bad way that there was no room for vans, but from the outside it was clear that there was room."
6411,3193408,5,LaKant33,21/08/2023,Very good campsite with free placement under the pines (prefer pitches at the far left of the campsite which are quiet). Modern and clean toilets. Large swimming pool with diving board. We stayed 2 nights (€37.80 per night for 1 tent with 2 people with electricity). Bus 5min walk to Lisbon (45min bus / 2€ per person one way) or Uber about 12€.
6411,3186695,3,fossier,20/08/2023,"The highlight is its location. We were able to visit Lisbon without using the van. A bus stop is next to the campsite. We used the 24h pass giving access to all public transport for less than 7 euros per person. The swimming pool and the reception are also positive points. Negative points: the toilets are old and not very clean, but the water is hot and flows well; the price."
6411,3186318,3,roz26,20/08/2023,"Ideal for visiting Lisbon. The reservation assured us a place but a slight lack of organization of the campsite (or campers) forced us to change our location. The downside: too few sanitary facilities given the capacity of the campsite and limited cleanliness. Bus stop nearby, but do not hesitate to take a taxi, it will cost you barely 8€ to get to the center of Lisbon (same price at 4 for a one-way bus trip, less waiting!). Very friendly staff, badge system, police patrols in the campsite. Nice swimming pool at the end of the day to cool off. 202€ for 3 nights motorhome electricity, family 4 people."
6411,3186176,4,Tripepin,20/08/2023,"We spent two days in the free camping area, they did not have free plots. There are light points in the free zone and everyone was plugged in, it depends on where you go, you have to have a fairly long cable. Relatively clean services"
6411,3183421,2,josant1976,19/08/2023,"Quite expensive camping, 84.20 euros for two nights, two adults and one child. Although I still think that it is the best option, the score would improve a lot with a little more cleanliness and order. Traveling by public transport to the center is very complicated. The Uber costs about nine euros. We consider the best option. Emptying and filling area in optimal condition. Light with little power."
6411,3179994,2,L_Fabia,19/08/2023,"We didn't feel comfortable. Enormously loud music from the restaurant, plus highway noise. Dishwashing and washing buildings in our area were either completely abandoned or completely dirty and littered. There is a lot of space between the seats, but the place is made of dirty dirt. The men's toilets were repeatedly soiled with faeces."
6411,3174975,1,Antuning,18/08/2023,"The facilities abandoned and with very little maintenance. Another thing was that we arrived and they told us that they were full, but if we wanted we could put ourselves in the camping area. During our stay we have verified that many plots have been empty... I haven't quite understood it. The luck they have is that there is not much alternative to choose. The photos have nothing to do with today..."
6411,3170756,4,GregMarjo,17/08/2023,"Apart from the price (€62 for 5) and the noise of the expressway, it's incredible to find such a large campsite in the heart of the capital. Swimming pool, restaurant, minimarket, fairly large paved site with each water point, table and electric terminal. Bus stop at the entrance to visit Lisbon without taking your vehicle. We recommend."
6411,3163875,1,uglynorth,17/08/2023,"“Security” allowed dodgy vans in via the exit but didn’t allow us into the campsite because we were on our bike, they told us to leave the bike outside by the main road, when I explained I was loading the bike into our van to leave , as we didn’t trust them, he told us we couldn’t do that either. Walked in, drove the van out, loaded the bike into the van on the outside and they still wouldn’t allow us back in, would not refund us, police on site were friendly, however the security guard has an ego."
6411,3163548,5,Tami63,16/08/2023,"It is certainly quite expensive for Portugal (€57/night in a van for 4), but this campsite is very pleasant: large, lots of space, you feel very good there. On the other hand, do not get too close to pitches close to the highway for noise… the toilet block near our pitch was recent and clean with hot water in the showers even late at night. Perfect for visiting Lisbon"
6411,3161850,4,m_irigo,16/08/2023,"Perfect for visiting Lisbon if you go with a camper or caravan. The campsite a bit expensive, but good services."
6411,3160161,4,,16/08/2023,"The place deserves 3+/4-. Pitches ok with water and electricity on site. Table with benches. Most pitches are shaded. Pool very nice and clean. Sanitation facilities are clean and tidy, although you can see the passage of time on them. Price for 3 nights camper 2 + 2 = 210 euros. Access to the center of Lisbon very easy stop at the campsite, 30-45 minutes. Buses in Lisbon have Wi-Fi"
6411,3156625,3,gastonlecombi,16/08/2023,"Campsite quite close to Lisbon. +/- 40 min from the center with the 714 bus. The problem, the last bus from the center is at 10:30 p.m. Friendly welcome, they speak French. On the other hand , the campsite itself is not maintained . The sanitary facilities are clean but the campsite could be 10 times better. Price €37 1 van + 2 people on a tent site because there is no more space."
6411,3154778,5,MS7473,15/08/2023,"Good camping in the city (I've seen few more beautiful in Europe) pitches with water, electricity and picnic table, nice swimming pool and Police (not security service but really Police) always present. Showers dated but clean and hot. Generally clean bathrooms. To get to the center of Lisbon use the BOLT app (Portuguese Uber) with €8-10 for 4 people. OPTIMAL"
6411,3148355,1,jdickopp,14/08/2023,"The location with access to the city is the only good thing. Otherwise there is a really unbearable volume here until early in the morning, especially due to the adjacent open-air disco, the swimming pool and the soccer field. Four out of five nights of extreme restlessness are draining."
6411,3148207,4,jejeJeepee,14/08/2023,Very large campsite A bit noisy Pool a bit crowded
6411,3143865,4,psaintouen,14/08/2023,"Very large campsite 45' by bus (20' by Uber) from the center of Lisbon. Very shaded and very well equipped: supervised swimming pool, tennis courts, paintball, children's play area with a few animals, rather quiet during the day (with the cicadas for breakfast)... in short, a very good place to park and visit Lisbon. So, of course, it is located near the highway, and some locations are really close to traffic and therefore car noise. But around 85% of the campsite is not in this scenario. If you arrive ""hard"" or at the very end of the day, given the number of residents, you risk finding yourself on the worst pitches and therefore with noise and little crowding."
6411,3136535,5,montydj,13/08/2023,"Great camping 10 minutes from Lisbon, large and very spacious squares, if you have teenagers, right next to it, a 15-minute walk away, they have a restaurant with a disco"
6411,3114318,1,rossa,10/08/2023,"Very large but abandoned campsite. No attention and care. Many abandoned services and those where you could go very old and in a state of disrepair, even if the cleaning was done. We were given a pitch near the road and very noisy. Dogs of unknown origin roaming in an area of the campsite. We didn't feel safe. High price. Uber comes to the area."
6411,3105205,1,nachoyreb,09/08/2023,"I paid for a plot, went out to dinner and when I returned, a camper that hadn't paid a plot had occupied it for me. I had left my things that were thrown to the side. I went to reception and the solution was ""IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU LEAVE THE CAMPING BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO REFUND YOUR MONEY"". So I had to collect my things as best I could from the other camper and be left without a parcel and without money"
6411,3104810,1,pocoyohuron,09/08/2023,"There are bad campsites and then there is the Lisboa campsite, a complete disaster and it calls itself 4 stars. They rob you, in my opinion I think they don't reform it because people continue to pay for it like this."
6411,3104318,1,Karsia,08/08/2023,"We stayed here for 1 night and found it completely overpriced, €58 camper incl. 2 people. All day sound from 5 p.m. to 12 a.m. in an adjoining club. The place very unkempt and run down. We looked at Lisbon and left quickly. No recommendation, avoid the place if you can. Lots of noise, lots of hustle and bustle, sanitary very dirty. We won't be back."
6411,3101826,5,SimonMacDonald,08/08/2023,Very expensive but I cannot fault the site itself. Large pitches and a pool onsite that is included in your stay. If you are happy to pay the price of the stay then you won’t be disappointed in the actual site. Secure entry almost in the middle of Lisboa. Uber worked well here. Around €10 into the city. Facilities well maintained and clean.
6411,3101160,3,davichin023,08/08/2023,"€40 in a motorhome per day in free camping without electricity. we had to find a flat area. The main facilities are clean, although the ones nearby due to the free camping area are disgusting. Once camped there are light points where you can plug in without problem. Very good bike route and of all kinds. Noise but the truth is that tranquility and peace if you get away from people."
6411,3093179,1,MariayBayo,07/08/2023,"We spent two nights, two people in a van, for which we paid an outrageous €116!! (58 per night) very expensive! for being the only one in the area. The supermarket is a more expensive scam impossible! Without any products, it's more of a kiosk than a supermarket. I recommend buying outside. And the same thing with respect to the bar... very expensive for the quantity and quality of the food. Dirty and neglected areas. I would never return."
6411,3091696,2,NewSchnitzel,07/08/2023,"Standing for 58€/night incl. 2 adults/electricity. Sanitary often not clean. Toilet narrow/rarely paper. Shower temperature not adjustable. Water/sewage on the pitch. Outdoor pool ok, beach chairs cost extra & loud music is played. Security top. TV reception with luck, WiFi in the reception area/first row next to it. Value for money unacceptable, just because the only CP in Lisbon."
6411,3084769,1,quicoiari,06/08/2023,"Neglected camping with the services and care of the plots. The staff very fair. Very expensive for what it offers. They are lucky to be near Lisbon. It's Saturday and we've been listening to unbearable music from 2pm to 11pm. Luckily at 11pm, it ended suddenly when we couldn't take it anymore."
6411,3074326,3,Kaufmonline,04/08/2023,Good solution if you want to spend a few days in Lisbon. Very spacious places and relatively quiet for being in the middle of the city. The cleanliness could be improved. Attention: in the mini market there is not much that is useful and there are no shops within walking distance. Better to shop beforehand.
6411,3042551,2,GioKia,29/07/2023,"Stay away! Smells like pee everywhere, dirty toilets. Simply a monopoly in Lisbon"
6411,3038001,1,VeravdDungen,29/07/2023,"very expensive! cleaning is wiping with a dirty mop. buses with hundreds of children are dropped off at the playground and swimming pool. zoo and bouncy castle do not belong to the campsite. no wifi except at reception. all paved camper pitches also with a tent. first place turned out to be occupied, a new one was assigned next to the toilet (quiet area) well not! Don't stand unless you have to!!!!!!!!!"
6411,3037846,4,Babsi28,29/07/2023,"Campsite with large pitches and lots of trees. Each pitch has its own electricity connection and water point. The sanitary facilities are neat & clean. If you have a place near the swimming pool, you have to expect noise, as there are a lot of coaches with children who use the pool as an outdoor pool in the morning. And we found the price very high at €132 for 2 nights."
6411,3037138,4,lilydu33,28/07/2023,Large campsite with beautiful pitches under the trees equipped with a water point with drainage and electricity. Quiet despite the proximity of the expressway and roosters crowing in the morning. It is secured with badges to enter and leave and police officers patrol all day. Wifi on the plot. 40 minutes from Lisbon by bus 714 for 2 euros. Cycle path from the campsite.
6411,3037043,3,pacofer2,28/07/2023,good campsites to visit Lisbon very safe a bit expensive but it's better than being robbed
6411,3030237,5,ayperbla,27/07/2023,"I thought it was a very clean campsite, super large, good services, good connections to the city center (bus and Uber), pleasant staff and very safe, recommended."
6411,3026871,1,eliant97,27/07/2023,"The only campsite in Lisbon, and fortunately for them, otherwise no one would come. Obsolete, poorly maintained, dirty, poorly served by means and finally expensive. The worst and most expensive of those seen so far in Portugal."
6411,2999548,4,martavivacamper,21/07/2023,"We had a hard time finding a safe area in the city, the rest of the indications in the application in terms of areas, did not have good comments, as we were traveling with children we played it safe, the campsite is not cheap, but it has very good services, there are very clean and spacious showers, a swimming pool, a park, the staff is friendly IMPORTANT the pool closes at 7:00 p.m. and the minimarket at 6:30 p.m."
6411,2995924,4,gregwas,21/07/2023,"Spacious place, each camper has its own pitch with water and electricity connection. Toilets and showers in good condition. €50 per night for 3 people in a camper."
6411,2992788,3,LHERNANDEZ,20/07/2023,"We have been three nights. The campsite is expensive, but it has everything. The only drawback is that the reception staff is terrible, they do not help you or give you information. It seems more like they are annoyed that you ask. The girls who were serving were very unfriendly."
6411,2983234,4,kukumberri,18/07/2023,"July 2023. Acceptable camping a little expensive (€46) night, yes or yes with light. Bathroom a bit old but as I say acceptable. Bus to the center close but not worth it. An Uber €7 to the center from the door"
6411,2980292,3,KasperskyVan,17/07/2023,"The only campsite in Lisbon, we read about robberies in campers and we prefer to pay than risk it. It is very expensive but peace of mind is not paid for. The police walk in the vicinity. The bathrooms are very acceptable, it is not a luxury campsite, although for the price it could be, spacious pitches but don't expect much. The pool is fine, but groups of children come in summer to spend the day free time…"
6411,2979281,4,FamSantDurant,17/07/2023,"Ideal to stop the camper and visit Lisbon. Use Uber, as we read several reviews here of car park thefts in the city. We stayed from 7/14 to 7/17 in a space with water and electricity. No privacy Bathrooms a bit old, but in order. There are security guards in the park and badges to get in and out. The pool was always closed. Noise comes from shows at night but they stop at 11pm."
6411,2962523,3,garmingr,14/07/2023,"Good place, 2nd time that we repeat with a brutal difference in price, too expensive"
6411,2958268,3,Manono56,13/07/2023,"Only campsite in Lisbon. secured by badges to enter and exit. Police round the campsite. Small toilet, old but clean. large swimming pool not too enter but pleasant to cool off. we stayed there for 3 days and for 3 days the swimming pool is taken over by groups of children from the leisure center from 9am to 5pm."
6411,2954513,2,ccasales12,12/07/2023,"Quite a place, but it's a shame that the only campsite in Lisbon has these toilets and showers, the minimum is to leave some utensils so that we can clean it before entering, good shaded areas, connections to the center by Uber very well, the bus takes a long time, good security at the entrance, the council should do something with more caravan areas or improve this campsite"
6411,2952061,4,igbcg,11/07/2023,"Ideal location to explore Lisboa. Beautiful, large pitch with water connection. Large bus map at the entrance. Line 750 to the next metro (Colegio Militar) city center about 30-45 minutes. On the way back, pay attention to the stop in front of the campsite!"
6411,2939276,4,gigino2011,08/07/2023,"Huge campsite, very convenient for reaching Lisbon by bus. The spaces are poorly maintained but everything is clean. The swimming pool is very large. Lots of potential but little exploited. Still great campsite to visit beautiful Lisbon."
6411,2925110,1,leonifelix,05/07/2023,"Sanitary facilities super dirty and old. In the women's showers, one of 4 showers can be locked. Grounds very neglected and dirty. Concerts next to on weekend very very noisy!! Far too expensive for what is offered. Unfortunately, there is only this place near Lisbon."
6411,2902505,5,MSchollbach,28/06/2023,We were from 25.06. - 27.06. here. It's a great campsite with clean toilets and showers. A swimming pool is available and can be used free of charge. With Uber you can be in the city center in 30 minutes. It does seem a bit noisy in the area on weekends due to parties but it was bearable for us. Ideally located for a city trip.
6411,2901680,3,emmbra,28/06/2023,The campsite is fine and you feel safe there. The sanitary facilities are old and the staff is a little slow and seems unmotivated. The price is also quite high for what you get. The mini market was closed in the morning so we didn't even get rolls. The best way to get into the city is with Uber for around €10 each way.
6411,2873486,1,CamperlifeSundP,20/06/2023,"Value for money is just not right, 50 € a night. The place is nothing special, the sanitary facilities are old and not always clean. We know it's a city camping to visit Lisbon, but it still takes quite a while to get to the city. The most expensive and so far worst place on our trip through Portugal."
6411,2862596,3,NatiRic,17/06/2023,"Campsite well located for visiting Lisbon, spacious location but very expensive price 46 euros per night for 2 in CC"
6411,2858618,2,jack1957,16/06/2023,"Clean facilities but noisy and very expensive. to visit Lisbon, however, it is necessary to use public transport WHERE DOGS ARE NOT ALLOWED. A pity and an absurdity."
6411,2847955,2,SergioPinar,12/06/2023,It is very big and the price is high. We came to see Lisbon. Clean bathrooms. the road passes by with so much traffic that it looks like the sea. Few people in the gardening and cleaning of plots.
6411,2840727,4,Chaso3,10/06/2023,"Super campsite: very practical for visiting Lisbon, large plots, uncrowded swimming pool, surrounded by nature. The highway is a continuous noise so do not disturb, the weekend concerts a little more. Our children loved the playground and the soccer field. We stayed there for 4 nights, 2 adults and 2 children: 175 euros. We recommend it!"
6411,2823574,5,LucianoSga,05/06/2023,camping dated but with all the facilities good welcome and excellent service
6411,2819904,4,RosaReist,04/06/2023,"So far a good stay. Yes, you can hear traffic but you are in a big city so what to expect… Paris was not better for sure. Sanitary  is ok, places spacious enough, friendly reception. The open air concert is starting up so that will be some free music tonight. For now all okay and confident to have all car windows in place in the morning. 10% cut with NKC/ANWB Membership, possibly others work  too."
6411,2802309,4,campingott,30/05/2023,"Good location, nice pitches. The concerts taking place next door might disturb. We had a pitch that was quite far away, so everything was great for us."
6411,2790750,2,pecducomminges,27/05/2023,"Visited in May 2023. The pitches are correct, however the rest of the campsite is in a deplorable state, very poorly maintained. The swimming pool is normally open until 7 p.m., we arrive at 6:25 p.m., the lifeguard had already closed everything… the toilets are dirty, unbearable smell of urine in the men's toilets when the cleaning lady had just finished, it's to wonder if they do not clean the floor with urine!"
6411,2790335,4,CARDOTDEFENDER,27/05/2023,Municipal campsite easily accessible and clean. Unheated swimming pool cold at the end of April. 45 minutes of transport by bus to reach the city.
6411,2786423,2,JLPicard,26/05/2023,The only big campsite around Lisbon. Sanitary facilities old and in need of renovation. Sometimes it smells like urine. Not all shower doors can be closed. Park between the pitches neglected. Not enough performance for the price.
6411,2782863,3,davez,24/05/2023,"May 24, 2023. €31 per night for a van for two adults and electricity included. Spacious clean toilets and hot water. Bus 714 45 minutes from the city center €2 per ticket. The downside is the noise of cars on the adjacent expressway. But well located despite everything to visit the city."
6411,2780208,3,apr8778,23/05/2023,"Fairly decent campsite, good location, but expensive.  Good showers.  Major problem is road noise, and an open air club/bar that has music pounding until 4am, so be warned.  Also, staff on reception are the rudest most miserable people we met on our trip, it also took 50 mins to check on 4 bookings."
6411,2778126,3,diamandiev,23/05/2023,"way too expensive for what it has. Pros: closest to the city, hot water all the time. planty of space, they speak many languages on the receptions. Cons: grass is not cut (it is like a jungle), cocroaches run around in the night, toilets are not clean, old and not working properly. Only if you are visiting the city othewise go south there way better campings for 3rd of the price"
6411,2777820,5,dernobster,23/05/2023,"The perfect place for sightseeing in Lisbon. Located on the outskirts of the city (12€ with an UBER and you are at the Teatro National D. Maria II). Very nicely situated in a forest. Everything available. The showers and toilets are clean. electricity available. price acceptable. And those who are bothered by the ""alleged"" noise (normal for being close to the city) should reconsider whether camping is the right thing for them."
6411,2764655,4,Elcanario,19/05/2023,"Great for visiting Lisbon and Torre Belém, for the safety of leaving the ac, for €40 a day, with all the services, plots a bit small, but the rest is fine. Be careful with taking a taxi, ask for the price first, because there are some who go too far with the price of taking you to Torre Belém, for example."
6411,2761184,4,lacos,18/05/2023,"we have just spent 3 nights there in cc, fairly large pitches with water tap and table with bench. Very clean toilets. Beautiful swimming pool, bus 150 m to the city center. The noise of the expressway does not prevent you from sleeping."
6411,2747173,4,Ducavan,13/05/2023,Campsite well located and close to public transport. Large pitches with built-in picnic table. €50 per night with electricity included. Easy access and very friendly staff. Busy road nearby.
6411,2744386,1,Boss7373,12/05/2023,"Camping is good. There seems to be a store, but you can’t buy anything in it and it’s already closed at 18 o’clock. Plumbing for 3, the price of 45 euros per night is a lot. The only thing is that he is alone in Lisbon, so they are not particularly worried."
6411,2743677,3,Camper2003,12/05/2023,"Large campsite located in a park. large pitches with electricity and water column. Controlled entrance, numerous surveillance cameras and finally wifi everywhere. Services that need maintenance and daily cleaning that can be improved. Daily price for 2 people and camper with ACSI discount 36 euros."
6411,2740406,2,Chris032512,10/05/2023,"Very noisy campsite (nearby roads and incessant traffic, very loud concerts: provide ear protection), very expensive (40 euros/night in May), convenient bus stop in front of the campsite but long journey to the city center (approximately 50 min). Sanitary moderately clean, hot water if you wait long enough (too bad for the waste of water). But no other choice to visit Lisbon..."
6411,2740323,2,CampingSN,10/05/2023,"Location is excellent, sanitary facilities are clean, mini market available. For 10€ quickly in the city center by UBER. The aforementioned road can be heard clearly, but not particularly disturbingly. However, the adjoining concert area gives you the feeling of being on the front stage of Rock am Ring. I don't really need it on vacation..."
6411,2740088,3,Reiziger14,10/05/2023,"Expensive because it is near Lisbon, otherwise it is not special. Pros: the spots are pretty straight, the pool is clean and big enough. There is drinking water at the camper. Close to the airport. Negatives: Expensive, no WiFi at the camper, below average ""restaurant"", sanitary not clean and not well maintained."
6411,2731777,5,ReyFerFamily,07/05/2023,"Perfect option to visit Lisbon. Asphalt and level plots, impeccable bathrooms, perfect pool for a bath after visiting the city, soccer field, swing for the little ones, I think it also has a gym... And all the necessary services for the motorhome: gray and black water, drinking water and electricity. Ah, bus at the door, as well as Uber for €15 to the center of Lisbon!"
6411,2726226,2,lnbagal,05/05/2023,"it's the only campsite in Lisbon... €40 for 2 people and an expert and without electricity! a little expensive, we were far from the sanitary facilities and not very suitable compared to the size of the campsite."
6411,2712573,2,Piaeh,01/05/2023,"The campsite was ""okay"". The sanitary facilities in order. But nobody here has heard of course maintenance. The buildings are also very neglected. The only advantage is that you can take the Uber directly into the city."

6411,2703165,5,OvalCarpenter,28/04/2023,"Very nice campsite in the middle of nature, good services and plenty of places. Good bus connection to the city center. A tad expensive in our opinion for not being high season."

6411,2679860,4,ReinhardSchmidpeter,18/04/2023,"Large pitches under trees. Background noise yes, but not disturbing for us. Two menus in the restaurant for €18. Taxi to Torre de Belem: €8. Back from the city center with Tsxi for 10€. Very secure thanks to cards that you have to scan when you leave and when you return. Yes, the price of €41 per night including electricity is steep!"
6411,2673338,2,jwt,15/04/2023,"We had a mobile home without electricity for 41€/day. Sanitary facilities inadequate and partly neglected (some buildings closed or no longer used). Restaurant ok and cheap. Place beautifully situated in the forest, but noisy due to adjacent streets. Bus connection very good. In general, the space is too expensive for what is offered. Typical big city campsite."
6411,2670588,4,Goier,14/04/2023,"Recommended if you are going to visit Lisbon. Good services, although they could be improved, in terms of cleaning (WC). Taxi to the center for about €12 and bus €2 per person."

6411,2639176,3,3xi573n2,04/04/2023,The facilities are very good but expensive (€40 per plot for two people) for how far it was from Lisbon. We recommend taking Bolt to get to the center.

6411,2612023,3,PLG56680,16/03/2023,"Well placed to visit Lisbon. 32 euros per night, and 10% reduction with the ACSI card. the 714 bus is 200 m away...but the schedules are very variable...the proximity of the road is very noticeable. The planes too, two almost quiet nights...but the worst is the rock concert tonight...it starts at 10 pm."
6411,2610698,3,ankechris,15/03/2023,"we rented a bungalow. it was relatively quiet from the traffic. only the hut was equipped underground, it was not even possible to make coffee, let alone prepare a meal. the whole interior is very shaky and in dire need of renovation. it was clean thanks to the very aggressive cleaning products that took our breath away."
6411,2610124,4,samrobinson499,15/03/2023,Good location to visit Lisbon and Sintra from the bus stop outside. Clean bathrooms and very hot showers. Pitches not fully level and a fair noise from the highway but nothing too bad
6411,2609683,4,isiundpaul,14/03/2023,"Campground is clean. However, there is a star deduction because we were relatively close to the animal walking and a rooster crowed all night. But to see Lisbon top, the bus stops about 300 m next to the campsite."
6411,2602062,4,JLPOURRAT,07/03/2023,"Campsite with good services. The platforms are sloping. To review. Please note that small dogs are not allowed, even in a bag, on buses, trains and some taxis. We paid for it with another person whose little dog was in a pram. My bichon was on my lap. The driver didn't want to know. we had to go down. Damage !!!"
6411,2600254,3,bella6644,06/03/2023,"Very large campsite, all pitches have water, electricity as well as a table and a bench. The toilets are clean and the reception is friendly. It is true that it is a bit expensive, but you can reach Lisbon by bus or for 14,-€ by taxi. We stayed there for 3 nights."
6411,2596746,3,PhlapSon,03/03/2023,"Actually a nice campsite, nicely laid out and well equipped. However, the price is too high and the road noise from the highway right next to it is unpleasant."
6411,2593404,4,xivo,27/02/2023,"Spacious campsite with many entertainment areas, somewhat expensive for the low season but the bathrooms are clean and very quiet"
6411,2591879,3,Camel_Rider,26/02/2023,"For a place that is open all year round, it is rather unkempt and poorly maintained. The place would actually be nice, just the care. And the Lisboa card is only available for 48 hours, bad, but that's how we saved 32 euros."
6411,2584716,5,loakzebulot,20/02/2023,visited 10 days in December 2022 we loved it located right in the city center in a huge beautifully wooded park the pitches are huge concrete platform level wooden table elec terminal + water + black water + station sink 2 meters from the motorhome all with a location surrounded by grass the staff is very kind very professional and good advice
6411,2582949,5,MoustacheTour,19/02/2023,"We stood here 6 nights and we are satisfied. Unlimited showers with hot water, sanitary facilities are older but cleaned daily, electricity included. ACSI / ADAC card accepted. Access regulated via card reader, 24-hour reception and security. Good bus connection to the city."
6411,2575098,5,010554,12/02/2023,I...I find that this campsite has a lot of advantages...great walks at the bottom for the dog....pitch with private water....proximity to Lisbon by bus...safety...in short 1 good compromise to spend a few days in Lisbon
6411,2559092,5,Summit2022,23/01/2023,"I can't agree with previous speakers: 1. The showers are hot and clean! 2. The campsite was the quietest we've had in Portugal, despite being close to the motorway. 3. You don't need to pay extra fee for 4pm checkout. Overall a super city campsite! By the way, you can take an Uber to the city for little money :-)"
6411,2556889,1,Vale_abeja,21/01/2023,"We did not use the parking but only the loading and unloading, at first sight it seems very scruffy as a place, really not well cared for, the loading and unloading ditto, we found the free areas much more accurate. For €6.50 only for loading and unloading, this is definitely not up to par."
6411,2556257,1,tomwein,20/01/2023,"The one star is for safety in place (although everyone can walk in and out as they please as no one is checked) Electricity and water right next to each place. But the showers are cold, no wifi and the rest of the service offered as advertised on the website is not operational due to ""winter"". And we paid 80€ for 2 nights!!!"
6411,2549856,1,ManniMaster,12/01/2023,"We stayed for 2 nights in early January. Showers cold, space very spacious. Offers on the square had closed. There is a good bus connection to Lisbon, which is in front of the campsite. The price of just under €75 for 2 people + van is absolutely overpriced. Worst place so far. Unfortunately"
6411,2543541,1,Clank1296,06/01/2023,"Very noisy, right off the freeway, very expensive, and very dirty. Prices are not fixed. The note says that you can check out until 4 p.m. but you have to pay extra... it's just not fair. It's a worst place we'd be. Better sleep somewhere else. Very far away from the city. Almost impossible to visit the city without a car because it is in an industrial/highway area."
6411,2542930,5,DanielaKehm,05/01/2023,"Van 2 people and 2 dogs 31.60€. Nice reception. Sanitary facilities a bit old but everything was clean. Places are great all with electricity, sewage disposal and water. Lots of shade."
6411,2539512,3,neusbbtt,03/01/2023,"We stayed one night. We entered at 20:00 and they told us that we had to leave at 16:00. For the €41 we paid, we would have liked to have at least 24 hours. The facilities are very well equipped with everything you need, although a bit neglected. In our case we parked there to be able to visit Lisbon, we couldn't take advantage of the place. It has public transport to go to the city."
6411,2536662,3,Paescu9292,01/01/2023,"Spent four nights here, sanitary facilities are a bit old. Pitches are big enough with water and electricity."

6411,2520840,2,rhiwarbs,13/12/2022,"the campsite was €56 for 2 nights, 2 people, with electricity. The facilities weren't very clean, the showers were cold which in the summer might have been okay but in December I dreaded having to use them. Location was okay but I think we would have preferred to park somewhere closer to the city as even in a cab it sometimes took 30mins"
6411,2518741,4,celiwak,10/12/2022,"Huge, very practical campsite and especially in the forest in a big city with all the necessary infrastructures to make a stopover of 1 or more days. The sites are equipped with a tap, a sink, a connection. The toilets are cleaned regularly and the bins are everywhere and cleaned all the time."
6411,2514331,4,UrSch58,06/12/2022,"Space for large mobile homes. With bus 714 fast in Lisbon. Large shopping center can be reached on foot in just under 2 km. Nice welcome at reception. Negative: German shepherd dog running free and a lot of faeces in the meadow, dogs constantly barking."
6411,2513995,4,EdyBouhof,05/12/2022,Great campsite to visit Lisbon. You are safe and quiet.
6411,2513436,4,gooutbecrazy,05/12/2022,"Nice city campsite, with everything you need. Sanitary facilities rustic but clean. Friendly staff. But could have said that the bus doesn't start right in front of the front door, but 300m further up the hill to the right."
6411,2512973,4,FabioBrioschi,04/12/2022,"Far from the center, reachable by 50 minutes by bus. the toilets are clean but the convenience store is a bit shabby. almost 30 euros for one night is perhaps excessive but it is a big city and above all it is the only place where you can stop in Lisbon"
6411,2511140,3,PascalSainz,02/12/2022,"It is difficult to find a place to park overnight in Lisbon. Not really the choice but to come to the campsite. Correct location and sanitary facilities. Bus from the campsite entrance. On the other hand a little noise because motorway not far but bearable and quite a bit high price for the services 26 euros with Acsi card, but secure environment."
6411,2505439,1,emmawints85,25/11/2022,The facilities were dirty and the staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful. I wouldn’t stay here again.
6411,2501299,4,Larifari22,20/11/2022,"We were totally satisfied. The plots are great, everyone has their own picnic area and water. The sanitary facilities are very clean. The staff was also very friendly. The bus connection to the center is great! We paid €35.50 for one night, for 3 people and a van. Would definitely come again."
6411,2497013,1,WeegieWilly,16/11/2022,"Expensive.
Nice to have hard standing-but not level. 
Gents loos smelled really bad/Ladies smelled fine.
Toilet and shower cubicles very tight.
Toilet Roll & Soap, but no hand-dryer
1 hour bus ride into city centre on very bone-shaking streets. Don’t cycle-return uphill/poor lighting in park
MiniMarket opening inconsistent
No booking system for tennis/inadequate fencing &no access to collect balls"

6411,2487928,4,JLPicard,08/11/2022,The only campsite close to Lisbon. Directly at the motorway exit. Bus stop right at the entrance. Place is very large with many plots / parking spaces and very spacious. The facilities and pool are a bit old and a little neglected in the fall. Be sure to ask about package prices for multiple overnight stays. Reception is open 24 hours.
6411,2484231,3,guyota,05/11/2022,"Its location is its best asset. Otherwise, very dilapidated campsite, not much open at this time. Line 714 perfect to go to the center. We recommend the 24-hour ticket (not easy to find, in the center at a terminal) we returned with the 748 and we had to follow a not nice road without sidewalks to reach the campsite. Dinner at the campground restaurant good and hearty, canteen style."
6411,2478424,4,crlnhrmn,02/11/2022,Very practical campsite for visiting Lisbon without worrying about parking the van. Close to the center (bus or taxi). Well equipped

6411,2470981,3,Mjhon,30/10/2022,"What to say ? It is a basic campsite, 40 minutes by bus from central Lisbon, which I found relatively expensive (32€ per night in low season - CC 1 couple and 2 children) at the same time, wild stopping prohibited and very few other campsites! Clean but overall lack of maintenance (grass on the pool slabs, no squeegee in the showers, no nozzles on the pitch taps...)"
6411,2466255,4,BrigitteMorgenstern,28/10/2022,We also stayed 5 nights but only got a 20% discount. Swimming pool is floodlit all night although it is closed late. So there is no energy crisis here. Otherwise we felt comfortable. Bus 714 is great.
6411,2464209,4,HeKl,26/10/2022,"We took advantage of the offer of 5 nights with a 40% discount and were very satisfied. A constant level of noise in a city campsite is normal. Bus connections to the city are very good and frequent. Sanitary facilities a bit outdated but clean and cleaned regularly. Pitches are large and equipped with electricity and water. Difficult satellite reception, as there are many trees which provide pleasant shade in summer. WiFi worked perfectly. We didn't use the restaurant because the offer in town was too tempting. Friendliness at the reception still has some room for improvement."
6411,2463336,4,SallyCameron,26/10/2022,"Great location to Lisbon, 25 pounds with electric. Staff matter of fact, bus link to Lisbon outside, info on wall outside reception. 4 euros return, bus 714, 45 minute journey 
Swimming pool closed, tennis courts, small play park open.
Check out 4pm
four stars, as a little dated, clean enough, background hum of motorway, as in close proximity, but very best location to Lisbon"
6411,2462460,3,fabder31,25/10/2022,Very good reception with explanations for the buses. Correct pitches even if not flat. Old sanitary facilities. Housekeeping is only done after 10 am when the majority of people come to visit Lisbon and therefore need early showers. Road noise was not bothersome. 25.73 per night with elec cc and 2 pax with Acsi. Bus 714 at 5 min for the center.
6411,2459190,2,rikroux,23/10/2022,"This campsite lives largely from its proximity to Lisbon....October, 100% of activities closed. Campsite not maintained at all, very high prices. we settled in the middle of a waste disposal site, on the camping side. it is dangerous for our 4 year old. the toilets are dirty and dilapidated: filth, graffiti... I don't recommend, but no choice despite the lack of an alternative."
6411,2457319,1,saramicheleceramistalibero,22/10/2022,Absolutely too expensive for the services they give! Dingy toilets washrooms pure pitches with unreachable electrical outlets and Wi-Fi not working! 56 € for two nights with car and two people ?! Crazy go elsewhere we were only because we are too downtown to sleep free in such a big city
6411,2455341,4,Joeherman,21/10/2022,"We stayed here for 5 nights. On the basis of an offer, we paid a total of around €89 for 2 people, mobile home and electricity. We cannot understand the bad reviews. Toilets and showers basic but cleaned regularly. Toilet, soap and hot water also at the washbasins and sinks. Good bus service into town. We cannot recommend the restaurant"
6411,2455122,5,Bookylaa,21/10/2022,"Great and safe location for visiting Lisbon. Campsite has super size pitches with all amenities at each pitch. Excellent restaurant on site,great value for money."
6411,2453192,3,bubuvantana,20/10/2022,We stayed here for 1 night with our Sprinter (2 people without electricity) for €28.70. In general everything is ok but for the price the whole place is quite worn and run down. Late check-in at 10:30 p.m. was positive. Apparently open 24 hours.
6411,2453087,4,pelospeet,20/10/2022,"Clean facilities and level grounds, friendly staff. For not being high season, there are a lot of people and the bathrooms get a bit saturated in some hours, it is expensive although it has a very good location"
6411,2450485,4,sophiewiese,18/10/2022,"We were satisfied! The location near Lisbon and the bus connection definitely speak for the campsite! But the place itself is good, it is very large and there are many leisure activities. The sanitary facilities are not new but clean! Here many complain about the ambient noise, yes you can hear airplanes and cars from the freeway, but we didn't find it disturbing."
6411,2448886,3,Smithjim,17/10/2022,"Easy to get to with bus 714 50mtr up the road takes you to the middle of Lisbon for 2 euro. Large site but mostly empty in low season, dread to think what it’s like when busy! Some complain about musi, I stayed Sunday to Thursday without any, very quiet. Water and sort of sink on each plot. Shower blocks are in need of refurbish. It’s a city site so not cheap but ok."
6411,2446429,2,ScooterAdams,16/10/2022,"Big spacious campground, level pads to park your camper on. Shady, big pool, mostly clean facilities. The bus stops close the entrance and will take you right down town. The reception staff needs a lesson in customer service, rude and impatient. We came in the low season and most bathrooms are closed. Unfortunately, there are not many campgrounds in Lisbon, so this is probably your best option."
6411,2444774,3,tnzlc4,15/10/2022,"well located to explore the city (order a taxi or Uber, about 20-30min drive to the center). It's rather noisy at night because there's some kind of club nearby (music until 4am), but we were able to sleep anyway. The showers weren't the cleanest."
6411,2444312,4,LoidaSamu,15/10/2022,"The only campsite on the outskirts of Lisbon, good facilities, individual flat pitches with a camping table for each pitch, electricity and water point. Clean bathrooms, but only 4 showers and 4 toilets. Expensive: €56 2 nights 2 people/van. When we arrived there was live music nearby, very loud, but at 10:35 p.m. it ended. The second night without music. Noise of cars from the highway nearby, but you get used to it."
6411,2444224,5,letsbetz,15/10/2022,"We had a great time. Sanitary facilities relatively new and clean. Bus into town, music didn't bother us in the evening, we had a Beatles cover band ;) paid about €53 for 2 nights, 2P, 1H, camper"
6411,2441961,4,Katebmorris,13/10/2022,Huge tranquil campsite surrounded by trees.  Easily accessible for all sizes of motorhomes.  It’s close to the centre - we got Ubers everyday - they ranged between 7 and 14 euros depending on where you go.  The “menu of the day” was very good value.
6411,2435297,4,SchneeziegeJutti,10/10/2022,"Perfect starting position, 8 km by bike to the city, all cycle paths, safe even at night. Sanitary facilities neat, price 25 euros for 2 people in the camper including electricity"
6411,2433313,3,alfredosimoes,09/10/2022,"I had a caravan and stayed here for long time, recurrently, years ago. Now, the prices are insupportable. Price table has been create for riches. They forget, or do not know that recurrent clients are those who maintain a business on the top. It seems that they do not know about escalating economies. Let them wake up."
6411,2432822,5,Criscer,09/10/2022,"We have stayed in the alveolus area of the campsites, it has independent water and electricity outlets. Clean bathrooms with hot water at any time. Concert until 11:30 p.m. but then absolute silence and safe camping. Good location to visit Sintra, Lisbon or monsanto we moved in Uber or Bolt. We will return, we recommend it."
6411,2425404,3,anmarmal,05/10/2022,"Campsite in a large wooded park. Well defined pitches on stabilized platforms, water point, emptying and individual electrical connection. Decent toilets, cleaned between 9am and 10am (when you want to use them!) Bus lines nearby. but unbearable noise environment: traffic on the highway and outdoor concert in the adjacent hotel every evening until 11:30 p.m."
6411,2424160,5,p46ait,05/10/2022,"Nice campsite about 10kms from the center of Lisbon. Very clean facilities, they come by several times a day to clean. The people at the campsite are super friendly, the restaurant is very good for €8.50 you have the menu. At the exit of the campsite you have a bus stop that takes you to Lisbon. Yes, it is true that it is close to the highway and there is some noise. Motorhome, two people and light €27 per day."
6411,2417858,2,Josiii.h,02/10/2022,"In itself a nice area, but the motorway is very noisy and the price is far too expensive. For a car with a roof tent we paid 74€ for two nights. The toilet situation was terrible! At half past eight in the morning (when everyone wants to take a shower), the sanitary facilities were completely closed because they were cleaning. The reception staff was unfriendly. The bus connection to Lisbon is positive."
6411,2416050,4,MaAnMaFi,01/10/2022,"Nice campsite. Shower/toilets were older but clean, not what most people said! Pitches are a bit small for the price, but you can use a nice forest bench right by the pitch. Underride chocks are recommended, as they are on a slope, but with concrete as the subsoil. There is an open-air disco right next to the campsite, we didn't find it disturbing and it was always quiet at 11pm. Definitely the better decision in Lisbon :-)"
6411,2414709,3,lebeausergio,30/09/2022,very large campsite but between a highway and an open-air nightclub. An infernal noise from the cars and on the other side of the music. You really have to be deaf to sleep peacefully. I do not recommend it except for partygoers.
6411,2414565,4,niko22,30/09/2022,"I do not understand the negative opinions because finding a campsite with this type of service and also close to Lisbon, you should not exaggerate. However, it is true that we hear the music for a good part of the evening when we are opposite the concert hall, but it stops at 11 p.m. each evening, so it is not disturbing for us."
6411,2410586,1,Shatayen,28/09/2022,Wednesday 11 p.m.... The music from the open air is finally over... Why do you do something like that at the campsite in the city? There are probably enough ways to celebrate in Lisbon.
6411,2408291,3,campvankathi,27/09/2022,"+ only CP ""in"" Lisbon, pool, small supermarket and restaurant (not tested), wash houses clean but tw. very dated, level pitches with electricity and water; Contra: space allocation without explanation of what is there, wash house was cleaned from 8:15-8:45 - thereby locked - next door open-air stage (is right on the CP), overpriced from my point of view, but you can ask for it;"
6411,2402175,4,BigErnie2019,25/09/2022,"Great location, only 35 minutes by bike to Lisbon with safety vest. Good network of cycle paths, cars should be considered. Campsite for €37.10 for 2 people in a camper including electricity on site. (Unfortunately there was no WiFi at the site-a pity at the price it would be expected) Water at the site-here you have to use your own adapter, otherwise water wasted! Large pitches with their own bench. Waste water place = scrap & dirty."
6411,2397303,4,Archelon5,23/09/2022,"An old-fashioned campsite with concrete slabs and clean, worn water on each pitch but without any screens. To go to town by bike, take the cycle path and first right in the forbidden direction. At the end of the forest path, and not before, put your GPS on Torre de Belem (for example). The routes offered by Google maps are false or dangerous. Uber and tuk-tuk so rushed."
6411,2396655,4,TomderBadner,23/09/2022,"Very friendly welcome, space was allocated and was nice. There was electricity and water at every site, and many sites are currently free. Toilets clean, it is cleaned at least 2 times a day. Costs for KAWA/ electricity and 2 people 37.1 €/day. For a visit to Lisbon, I recommend ordering a taxi at the reception. Just €8.5 to Placa de Marquise Pombal"
6411,2394579,4,Westsidemobil,22/09/2022,"Perfect place to explore Lisbon in a relaxed way. The bus runs not far from the campsite directly into the city. It's not the newest campsite but absolutely sufficient and warm water. Of course you can hear the highway, but you can be in the city in just a few minutes. Absolutely perfect for us"
6411,2394474,3,Partner446,22/09/2022,"Very practical for visiting Lisbon. It is large and the pitches for campers are level. Large camping area. The services... rustic. There are areas in which they are closed or directly damaged. It is expensive for what it offers, but its good location towards Lisbon makes it convenient."
6411,2394039,4,jl.sb,22/09/2022,Just a bit overpriced and noisy in the evening but otherwise very nice. There is also the possibility to just park the car (without camping) for €5.30 per night (for mobile homes €12 per night) if you have other accommodation.
6411,2392481,3,BH33,21/09/2022,Very convenient for visiting Lisbon stayed three nights. Very pleasant staff. Site that would require more development. Price corresponds to its location in the city. Restrooms to revamp but maintained
6411,2390483,3,Zigotto34,21/09/2022,"Very nice, well-shaded campsite. We had a place on a concrete slab with water and electricity permanently. Very large swimming pool with restaurant ""€8.65 the menu"" and mini market. The toilets are clean but very old. The bus station nearby. Take the 714 to go to the center. 37, 10€ per night or 33,40 € ACSI.C, is Expensive!! Apparently it is the only campsite. Watch out for mosquitoes!!!"
6411,2387214,4,marjanvanhethooft,19/09/2022,"Great city campsite, spacious, great places. Sanitary indeed quite old but clean. Staff friendly. Lovely swimming pool. Stayed 1 night. By taxi there and back to the center, a total of €25.00. You can indeed hear the road but yes, it is a city campsite :) I would recommend this campsite."
6411,2387144,3,ahsturm,19/09/2022,"There are nice parking spaces, you should avoid the direction of the expressway, definitely too loud. Sanitary facilities are clean, even if the nearest one is currently being renovated, dirty facilities are definitely due to ""roommates"". Definitely recommended for a visit to Lisbon"
6411,2381414,2,finn9404,18/09/2022,"We arrived in the evening with our Bulli and had a lot of problems finding a level parking space with electricity within easy reach. Half the lanterns were out, making the search difficult. In addition, the sanitary facilities were rather unclean."
6411,2379778,3,mrAmrsX,17/09/2022,"Very outdated campsite. Has everything you need but for 75€ for 2 nights I would have expected more. Although it is relatively clean and the place is run by the police! guarded, but some buildings look like they should be demolished. With the bus and metro for about 7 € per person you can get to the center of Lisbon and back relatively quickly and easily."
6411,2378409,3,charlitos,16/09/2022,"Good location to visit Lisbon, bus 300 meters away that leaves you in the center (714 plaza fuegueira) the bathrooms downstairs are not bad, to go to sleep and take a shower enough although it lacks a lot of maintenance, small supermarket"
6411,2368522,3,jamesiai,13/09/2022,"Good location for Lisbon with bus stop 714, 5 mins walk away - takes 30 mins approx. Large campsite with very nice large pool. Staff busy but efficient / helpful. Plot designated and unfortunately a messy / noisy long term stay neighbour spoiled our stay. Own drain for water waste only not SEWAGE. Otherwise fine for camping on outskirts of town."
6411,2361122,3,MargaPrades,11/09/2022,"Very expensive, the price is not in line with the service it offers. They assigned us a place that was already occupied, they gave us another one and in the morning we had a note that we went to reception and they told us that they did not know why they had left the note... something out of control"
6411,2360112,5,vallespi,11/09/2022,Very well located quiet very welcoming. Not expensive at all …
6411,2355137,4,bram001,09/09/2022,Practical for lisbon visits. Nice camping area and nice personnel. Not most beautiful view. Facilities are good. Spend 2 nights here waiting for our luggage to arrive at the airport
6411,2332756,3,egehin,02/09/2022,the facilities deserve a serious refresh but are regularly cleaned the music until 10:45 p.m. until August 31 otherwise this campsite in Lisbon does its job
6411,2326324,4,bautisjp,31/08/2022,"Camping with all the services, quite expensive €59 per day but clean, spacious, light and close to the center of Lisbon Uber or taxi €10/12 and it gives security to leave it"
6411,2323218,3,KabeClassic,30/08/2022,"Old and worn campsite. Loud music is played every night until midnight. We have now stayed here for 3 nights. So if you want peace and quiet in the evening, avoid this campsite."
6411,2322904,5,chrisetbruno,30/08/2022,I also find all the negative opinions a bit exaggerated campsite clean sanitary also quiet only downside the reception is not welcoming good stay to you
6411,2319589,4,carlosjog,29/08/2022,"We have been with our Ac 3 nights and it is perfect to visit Lisbon. Bus stop 200 meters from the campsite that goes to the center in 45 minutes for €2. I don't give it 5 stars because I see it as a bit expensive for the campsite that it is, although the bathrooms are not as dirty as they say around here. And the hotel music bothers although in principle it is until 11pm. I would repeat for sure"
6411,2318973,5,celine4408,29/08/2022,I find negative reviews very harsh. Impeccable toilets where we went. Large pitches with water and electricity. Great swimming pool. Supermarket and cafeteria that help out. The nearby music stops early enough in the evening to not be disturbing. We don't hear highway noise. When I read reviews and sometimes see the 5 stars for poor parking...
6411,2308944,2,anjaontheroad,27/08/2022,The place is definitely getting old. We were glad to have our own toilet and shower. Check-in took forever. Value for money is not right here! The evening sound from the street and party noise is annoying. What's great is that you can get to the city center very quickly.
6411,2303858,3,ollem29,26/08/2022,"Campsite very well located for visiting Lisbon. You go directly to the historic center with the 714 bus. However, two highways border the estate, so the noise is constant day and night. The restaurant attached to the campsite organizes concerts and parties until 11 p.m., and the sound is very loud. Prefer pitches to the right of the swimming pool. The campsite staff are top notch. The price too high."
6411,2299327,4,Bibichat74,25/08/2022,"Top for visiting Lisbon we stayed 3 nights, clean and large swimming pool. convenience store that does the job. fairly large pitch with access to water, electricity and even a wooden table for each pitch. Sanitary ok, shower ok but not very hot. possible to call a direct taxi from a terminal at the reception."
6411,2297569,5,jahool1860,25/08/2022,"If you want to visit Lisbon a very good place. Young audience and often not typical campers. Good connection to the city and for about 20 € you can also take a taxi from the city center at night. We were there with 4 children in the high season, there was still enough space."
6411,2296536,3,lapolimitaenruta,24/08/2022,"We have been two nights this month and we can say that it is very big, the cost is high for what they offer, the bathrooms and services are not good at all, and poorly attended, the reception staff is not friendly at all, the best thing is the proximity to Lisbon city, the plots, as there are some adequate and others very irregular, large swimming pool and a basic restaurant"
6411,2289750,1,JOSEMARIA10,23/08/2022,"I've never been to a worse campsite in my life: toilets full of shit, sinks with even more shit. Saying disgust is an understatement. The only good thing is the pool. Pitches well. Bus next door to go downtown. Overgrown with weeds on all sides. Very careless."
6411,2289475,4,capf18,23/08/2022,"Well located campsite, the pitches near reception are the best (or those above the playground). Very large and clean pool. The old bathrooms, although comfortable, depending on the time, are somewhat dirty and without paper. Going to Lisbon by Uber costs between €5-12 depending on the area. In the restaurant you can eat very well for €8.5 for the full menu. Two adults, baby and van €85.7 2 nights. Three-phase plug."
6411,2277937,3,LucyWatson72,21/08/2022,Campsite is great with clean swimming swimming pool and pretty central. Lots of lovely trees. but the Noise from the club next door is horrific until 10pm Thursday and 11pm Friday and Saturday I would not recommend if you want to go to sleep early! Urbers cheap into town.
6411,2269068,1,Tanckman,19/08/2022,"To be honest: bad and overpriced place, unfortunately there is no alternative. Be sure to secure seats in the lower area (unfortunately even more expensive). In the entire rear area there is hardly any parking space in the forest and the sanitary facilities are overgrown and disgusting. Uber to the city: 8 euros"
6411,2265305,3,Multivag,19/08/2022,"Good situation. Bus nearby to go downtown. Bad for the noise. The highway next door. If it's not the highway, it's the planes and if not in August it's a hotel or something that has music with a party until very late at night. Tiny laundry for the piece of camping that is in size. Bring chocks, most of the pitches are uneven."
6411,2264869,1,Pedro2Greax,19/08/2022,"Run away ! outdated and unworthy sanitary facilities. some even seem abandoned. site strewn with fallen branches. The only comfort, we were able to leave within the hour and have the pre-payment refunded without any problem. 34€ per night with a 2 with 1 car and 1 small tent. Possibly acceptable with a motorhome or if you can rent a bugalow."
6411,2262828,5,MiguelPeralta,18/08/2022,"The campsite is very spacious, bus number 714 200 meters away that leaves you in the center, with everything for the children to have a good time, 2 children and 2 adults with a motorhome and electricity €52 a day, a bit expensive but it is normal being next to the capital of Portugal, you see a health mishap with my son and the staff of 10, a lot of shade, cafeteria with good prices, super small jam, we stayed 3 days"
6411,2256829,3,papoutes,17/08/2022,Expensive campsite but in a pleasant wooded area. The swimming pool appeals to children but we wanted to have dinner one evening at the restaurant at 9 p.m. it was no longer serving and offered me frozen pizzas…the supermarket is really limited…convenient for visiting Lisbon
6411,2252330,3,Sergiowski,16/08/2022,"The best and almost only option to enjoy Lisbon. Well connected, large, quite clean and good pitches with shade. The correct treatment by the staff and the pool also well. Somewhat expensive but understandable given the few feasible alternatives in the area. It is not the best campsite in the world but I would repeat without a doubt."
6411,2249876,3,Leimanro,16/08/2022,"We are close to reception and well, the bathrooms are close and very good, spacious plots, there is a swimming pool, park, play areas, and another paid children's area, there is a supermarket but come full of food, the restaurant just I don't know if it was a coincidence that when we went regular pro well, the most important thing to know is that you have to come with a jar of coins because they don't have change for anything, not even for the washing machine."
6411,2247864,2,softboat4390,16/08/2022,"The place is very dirty & neglected! The sanitary facilities are old, partly broken and poorly cleaned, if at all, only every few days. There is broken glass in the common areas that cannot be cleared away. Too expensive for what it offers (34€ per night for 1 camper van + 2 people without electricity). The only good thing is the proximity to Lisbon (10min with Uber for 7€)."
6411,2245868,5,Damian,15/08/2022,"Great, large camping close to the center of Lisbon.  comfortable, large spaces for motorhomes with water, electricity and drain for the toilet!  Concrete and friendly service.  Big swimming pool"
6411,2239486,4,giorgiocolazingari,14/08/2022,"Near the reception there are no problems: the rest areas are not perfectly level, but have a column with water and electricity. Maintenance is quick and the operators are friendly. In 3 nights the only problem encountered is hot water not always available. For the areas near the restaurant I don't know how to rate, but they seemed more dilapidated and noisy."
6411,2238279,1,chloe81,14/08/2022,"ABUSE €40 a night in a van for 1 person and a small dog! very unpleasant staff both at the reception and at the bar / restaurant, we really have the impression of pissing them off! only the doorman is friendly. dog accepted only on its pitch! frankly just fine when you can't get enough of the road and to be close to the center of Lisbon for a single woman and this feeling safe"
6411,2238250,2,FamilieHickel,14/08/2022,"Ok, two stars as it's a city campsite, otherwise there would only be one. The square is huge, so it doesn't seem overcrowded even in high season. It's quite dilapidated and old, the further from reception the worse. But our washhouse was clean. The staff is slow, unfriendly and unhelpful. Very noisy during the day and at night because of the motorway and the disco. Not again"
6411,2234622,3,Kepo,14/08/2022,"ok plots, with space, tomq of water and electricity. wide area. We are in the plots closest to reception, the clean sanitary block and with cleaning services. The water comes out hot. Near the pool, a pool with a couple of slides. Simple but useful to cool down. I give it 3 stars for the night music of a restaurant attached to the campsite. If we return to Libya we will repeat."
6411,2234545,4,Elisopola,14/08/2022,We went here a while ago and we loved it! It was just inconvenient to park and put the camper straight! It is still convenient for visiting the city of Lisbon! When we return to Lisbon we will come back here because it is a place in Sicily to leave the camper!
6411,2232776,1,jufa35,13/08/2022,"A shame! Overpriced campsite with services that are far from up to par. Abandoned campsite, poorly maintained pool with weeds everywhere around the pool. Home deplorable and unfriendly. The only positive point is the self-sufficient pitches with water and electricity. We don't recommend it"
6411,2229513,3,santi1976,13/08/2022,Neglected campsite but perfect to go see Lisbon. Laa Pinos area very nice for camping.
6411,2229292,1,Rafikis,13/08/2022,"Pros: It is the only campsite in Lisbon. It has a lot of potential because the pine forest where it is located is beautiful, the pool is ok and it is well located (approx €8-10 in Uber to the city). Cons: Very run down. They gave us the second farthest plot with the campsite barely 50% full. Bathrooms far, no light to reach, dirty. Very unpleasant reception. I paid €62 compared to €72 in Turiscampo"
6411,2224889,1,Laraetlaurent,12/08/2022,"Campsite on the edge of unsanitary conditions, dirty showers that do not lock, (I will not mention the toilets) abandoned land, and not to mention the emptying area (take your masks and gloves) a shame to 45e per night for a motorhome on a tent site, unfriendly staff - the noise is bearable knowing that there are Lisbon ring roads that pass nearby"
6411,2215228,1,sannni,11/08/2022,"We hesitated to go because of the amount of negative comments, but since there were some good ones, we finally went. What a bad decision... There are many abandoned toilets and the ones you can go to are quite old. Some caravans or shops look abandoned and are a bit scary. Those at reception are a bit serious and some don't even know where the camping services are. They sent us to a place where it was closed by default. The campsite is full of leaves, I think they have never been removed. If you have another option, do not go to this campsite. Apart from all this, very expensive for what it is. As there are no more offers nearby, they may have high prices. Overall the worst campsite we've ever been to."
6411,2212897,1,elinatapia,10/08/2022,"Camping to avoid, the campsite is dirty, common showers are abandoned, the employees are very unpleasant. The one star is deserved for the city bus 200m away which takes you direct by bus."
6411,2211269,1,yann44330,10/08/2022,"Horrible the worst campsite I've seen, in France it wouldn't do 1 more season"
6411,2211089,1,stela9,10/08/2022,"Horrible. sinks and showers suck. I have not seen more unhealthy camping in all of Portugal. One thing is that the facilities are old, and another very different thing is the shit that the services have. Do not enter!!!!"
6411,2210934,4,icaleo,10/08/2022,Honestly correct for a capital. Easy access to the center of Lisbon. It is not a relaxation campsite but a campsite to visit the city so normally we do not stay there the day so correct for that.
6411,2195710,1,minimoi26,08/08/2022,"Very limited campsite, especially given the price (€36 in a van). Sanitary facilities not fully maintained (2 out of 5 toilets broken down, same for the showers) The only good point is the bus stop nearby for the historic center (about 45 mins)."
6411,2191739,3,Family4Road,07/08/2022,"The pitch was very nice. Also the facilities and the pool (although it closed early, at 19:00). We think it is a bit expensive for what it offers."
6411,2189945,1,VanKGCS,07/08/2022,"Overpriced considering the noise and the services! 55€ for a van and 4 adults (2 children considered as adults!) Dirty and dilapidated sanitary facilities, swimming pool and supermarket closed at 7:00 p.m. on a Saturday, only the electricity included in the price deserves the star. It's expensive to take a hot shower!"
6411,2181794,3,DanielFu,05/08/2022,"One can have mixed opinions about this campsite. Yes, it has ""everything"" you need, but other pitches also have this ""everything"" and you don't pay €45 but €15 for one night. I'm not sure if this Lisbon bonus justifies the €30 difference. Tip: Next time we would just look for something instead, 20 minutes outside of the metropolis."
6411,2175371,5,maestrorocker,04/08/2022,"It's perfect? No, sure. Is expensive? Yes, a little but it has everything, it has space, it has 10A electricity that is found in few campsites, it has a very large and free swimming pool, it has Lisbon at the door, it has helpful maintenance teams. the only defect I put is the mini market. It's really mini and the prices are super inappropriate. I live 1 km from the park and spend my motorhome life here."
6411,2172387,1,despfamily4,04/08/2022,"If you like the refugee camp style where we are huddled together, you are welcome. The staff is execrable. We are in a van and have just paid 57€ per night. This campsite is a real factory. The toilets are dirty. We hear the highway throughout the camp. Run away !!!"
6411,2164226,4,Jotzdi,02/08/2022,"Large pitches with their own camping bench, electricity and water supply, shady pitches within 15 minutes by taxi/Free Now in the city center (maximum €10) ideal for exploring Lisbon as a camper - sometimes loud music in the evenings, but quiet from 11 p.m. - expensive (79€ for two nights) Sanitary facilities getting old, but in order and relatively clean."
6411,2163184,4,esterdep,02/08/2022,"We spent two nights at the campsite for €86. Level pitches with water and electricity and shade. The area of showers, bathrooms and area to wash the dishes is fine. There was hot water in the morning and at night. Very convenient if you want to visit Lisbon. We went to the center of Lisbon by Uber for €9. We returned by bus (€2 per person). On Sunday the music was heard until 11:00 pm from a nearby hotel."

Convenient with the bus that goes directly to the city center (714), large practical pitches in a van, swimming pool, correct sanitary facilities... the real problem is the music from the nearby restaurant and the noise from the highway, but hey... and the price is high, but Lisbon's only campsite!"
6411,2152777,3,Tacklbury,31/07/2022,Large site with plenty of facilities & a great pool. Decent sized level pitches with electic and water available.Cleanliness in the shower/toilets could be better.

6411,2143224,2,matthieuablin,29/07/2022,"Only campsite to visit Lisbon. It feels like he has no competition. Very old campsite. Most of the places in this one seem abandoned. I thought I was doing urbex during my stay. The swimming pool could be a good asset but it is very cold and especially INVADED by hundreds of children (outdoor centres) coming to spend the day there. If you're looking for a place to relax, you won't be here. Depending on your location, you may be placed next to very noisy restaurants, a dog hotel, or stuck to the road. Only positive points: easy access 24 hours a day and immediate proximity to the bus to get to the city center."
6411,2141961,4,Javisag,29/07/2022,"Good campsite within its limitations of the old, but with all the services. Expensive, but there are no other options in Lisbon. We had problems with the bathroom cleaning staff, they started cleaning when people got up (8-9 AM) and they wouldn't let you in, they sent you to another place far away...and with a very bad character!! Good pitches, good pool."
6411,2136969,2,Nessa249,28/07/2022,"The only good thing is the location to Lisbon. With Uber you can get there very quickly.

Very noisy because of the highway, so I asked to be moved back to the back of the campsite, without lights, in the woods with the only maintained sanitary facilities far away. The campsite plays on the proximity of the bus stop which leads to the town centre."
6411,2098144,3,elijuan,20/07/2022,"Pleasant and quiet campsite, one of the showers is missing a door and some bathrooms are a bit dirty, the employees did not know where to empty the water and that has been the only bad thing. The campsite is large, there are activities for all ages and tastes."
6411,2096010,3,afilator,20/07/2022,"Quite cool campsite, practical to see the city, price a bit high, but to see Lisbon, the best option, the bathrooms a little neglected and dirty, but don't take away your illusion, quiet and noise from the nearby motorway, but rest well. friendly and polite staff. they speak Spanish."
6411,2092513,2,stephdew,19/07/2022,Campsite with great possibilities but too noisy due to the nearby highway. high price. €46 per night for an equipped pitch.
6411,2078278,4,RobSchnei,15/07/2022,"Large pitches, clean sanitary facilities, access to the pool area included, fast, friendly check-in, centrally located in Lisbon (bus stop in front of the door). High season 45,- per night for liner, 3 pax incl. electricity. good feeling of security, since parking attendants and police patrols are present. We were satisfied."
6411,2075530,2,kathiiieee,15/07/2022,"A city like Lisbon definitely deserves a nicer CP! The place is neglected and the sanitary facilities are dirty. The atmosphere on the pitch is not good either. The police are patrolling the square, it doesn't give you a good feeling. The place has great untapped potential, it could be so beautiful here! The only good thing is the proximity to Lisbon; Bus 714 in 50 minutes in the center"
6411,2071338,3,Flecke,14/07/2022,"It was perfectly OK! There are worse things. We had a good pitch, electricity, water. Showers and toilets that work. At the reception we were received very friendly. As an ADAC member you get a discount. We were allowed to choose a seat. Depending on traffic, the 714 bus takes between 20-45 minutes to the center of Lisbon. We were completely satisfied."
6411,2053866,1,Torenaiz,09/07/2022,"Reserve a plot and they placed me in free camping. Very difficult to find space for a 6m van. Very noisy, at 6:00 in the morning the neighbors with the music on full blast. I don't recommend it at all."
6411,2052546,1,hublot,09/07/2022,"Worst campsite in Europe. Extremely noisy. No Rule, total anarchy. Traffic at all hours, festive campers with big loudspeakers day and night, songs at 3am. No reactions from staff. Catastrophic toilets. You will sleep better on the side of a highway."
6411,2051620,2,camperoff,08/07/2022,"40€ for small van, 2 adults and dog for pitch with water and electricity. Surface is not flat, it showed us 7 degree slope, not much, but was a bit uncomfortable. Sanity rooms are very small, I had to wait in line every morning. Showers are only cold, water is heated by sun, but clearly they don’t have enough for everyone. Restaurant has crazy queues, it takes 1 hour to get food during the lunch"
6411,2048479,2,jerovega7,08/07/2022,"It is depressing that a city like Lisbon does not have an area for motorhomes that lives up to its status as the capital of Portugal. That it only has an old-fashioned and poorly maintained campsite, so far from the city that it is not worth going to it, because it is expensive, poorly maintained and has poor facilities for motorhomes."
6411,2041625,2,Sabsi87,05/07/2022,"Mega loud music until 11pm and a bit wild. The front seats are okay for visiting the city, but the condition at the back is really not nice. Sanitary front ok. Bus connection to the city is good. All in all but for 42 € too expensive but you hardly have an alternative"
6411,2038806,3,JesusPina,04/07/2022,"in general good facilities and a bit noisy because it is next to the road; but a bit expensive, €22 for a shop and a motorcycle...but of course it's Lisbon."

6411,2013037,2,park4nightbreton,26/06/2022,The positive the proximity of the city and the places in the shade. We arrived for one night a car and a roof tent: 50€ for 3 people. Receptionist not pleasant and in the evening private party on the campsite with scene and very loud qon. We wanted to rest but the nearby road is really very noisy! I do not recommend except maybe in CC.

Poorly maintained campsite and sanitary facilities not very clean.. we came across a very nice receptionist, speaking French and rather welcoming."
6411,2006234,2,tonerre66,24/06/2022,"Serious advantages of this campsite: the proximity of the city and the places in the shade. the campsite lacks a lot of maintenance, everything is dilapidated, the reception staff is not sympathetic. but hey, the prices are correct so don't cry over our fate....."
6411,1993035,2,mastix,19/06/2022,"High prices but it is Lisbon Many squares Trees that give a lot of shade The services are normal They are not very clean. I deduct 3 stars for the music at full volume If you were thinking of resting, you have it clear Not even in Ibiza in August is there such a racket. If you are young and you like going out you will like Pars families and lovers of calm a horror."
6411,1990560,2,Guzzi66,19/06/2022,"only interest: location close to the city. obsolete, old-fashioned and a lack of maintenance that worries when you see carpets of dry leaves on the ground in the middle of the eucalyptus trees...."

6411,1982642,3,levelo,16/06/2022,"A bit overpriced for what is on offer. But what do you want to do if there are no alternatives. Sanitary facilities still in the green area. If you want, you can also find a quiet place on this square, without the great influence of the adjacent music. Bus connection for visiting the city, great."
6411,1979667,2,flow111,15/06/2022,"Because there wasn't really an alternative, we also chose the place to look at Lisbon. We paid €84 for 2 nights/ 2 people/ 1 camper. The place is sad to look at, littered, restaurant and shop were closed, sanitary facilities ok. For so much money we have had much nicer places. Pity! potential would be there."
6411,1972142,5,ambr4,12/06/2022,"It is true that it is expensive, but it has all the necessary and comfortable facilities for camping. Good bathrooms, sites with electricity, water, well delimited. Bathrooms, showers, sinks, etc. Very good alternative to get to know Lisbon. The taxi to the center costs less than 10 euros."
6411,1972097,3,laurentjuliette,12/06/2022,"For this period cleanliness of the sanitary limits... I would be worried about July August. However friendly staff and large location with sink and water point as well as gray water connection, it is a plus. Lolo&juku"
6411,1969855,5,retirement,12/06/2022,"Great site, aimed at the young people as they hv lots of loud music at night, however, apart from a used tampon on the floor the showers and toilets were clean. I didn't use the pool, so can't comment on it. The only downside was the shop, very disappointing, poorly stocked and 10 mins before they closed, wouldn't give change, needed to pay with correct money. I would stop here again."
6411,1968726,1,kleu00,11/06/2022,"The only thing I liked here was the proximity to Lisbon. I don't think old toilets are bad, but these ones were just disgusting, it stank a lot. Highway noise okay too, but super loud music plays here until really late at night. I'm really angry, especially because of the cleanliness! If you can avoid it go somewhere else!!!!!"
6411,1967253,4,Marlouche64,11/06/2022,The swimming pool and the location in Lisbon are the only assets of this campsite!
6411,1965827,3,JeanMichelDavid,10/06/2022,"The only advantage of this campsite is that it is close to lisbon, loud music late and the nearby highway. In addition to expensive for the services offered everything is very old. On June 10 the store is still closed, by the self is really correct"
6411,1965378,5,nawarvan,10/06/2022,"Perfect camping!! If you want to visit a city and have your camper in a safe place it is a good idea. Much place, swimmingpool, 6km to the centre! I recommend!"

6411,1908358,4,F.Miranda,22/05/2022,"Didn’t sleep, we used only the empty of grey water and full tank of water. We paid 7.40 euros. Decathlon just in front. Nice stop."
6411,1896502,4,bb.stefkovic,17/05/2022,"Big campsite with everything you need, we had great place. Small market (better to have smaller change, cash only up to 5 €). The camp has quite a lot of traffic, many dogs, concerts in the evening, so it is necessary to take into account the noise. Pool already open. Many trees. We had an amazing time (10 weeks), and we would love to come back here. Nice staff, bugs fixed relatively quickly."
6411,1883300,2,mariuspyonline,11/05/2022,"Very littered, we were assigned a Wiesenals parking space on which there was no more space. We had to stand diagonally somewhere and first disposed of the garbage on the meadow. Feels like sleeping in a parking lot, but for €28. Shower and toilet ok. Certainly fine as a workaround."

6411,1859414,2,vduarte,29/04/2022,"Without competition, the car park always increases prices, the price of a cell is very expensive €37.10, alternatively for €20.20 they send you to a car park or areas of great slope, a robbery."

6411,1856462,4,federici1988,27/04/2022,Nice and well maintained campsite. Not long clean and renovated bathrooms. Great place to stay in Lisbon. The only drawback is the price which is quite high compared to the rest of Portugal but there are not many alternatives if you want to stay in the city. All in all not bad restaurant with cheap dishes.
6411,1855171,3,korrigan76,27/04/2022,"Campsite in a beautiful well-shaded park at the gates of Lisbon with All services but noisy (behind a 4-lane) and expensive (location and services) Top location for visiting, with family or several, by taking an uber to reach Belem (7€ /5min) or the city center (13€/ 10-15min) or Sintra (20€ 20-30min). From belem you can also take the tram or the train to the center (2€)"
6411,1854834,1,BerthaStanley,26/04/2022,"The only pro is that it is convenient for travel into Lisbon. The toilets and showers were filthy. We were told where to park and placed in between what seemed like a community of pemanent residents with, dogs chasing us, noisy and kids playing all round our van (very close) while we slept. it was expensive 37€ for 2 people, one night, small van and no electricity. would not recommend"
6411,1854702,4,isabelvanlife,26/04/2022,Very large camping with everything on site. Extremely close to the city which is the biggest advantage. Grounds not well kept or maintained which is a pity. Some pitches are awkward and your site is allocated on check-in so not a free choice to choose. We drew the short straw so stayed 2 nights rather than the 3 nights we planned. Overall better than average so deserving of a 4-star.
6411,1845132,4,Dorkin,22/04/2022,Large campsite with lots of amenities on bus route to city. Bus took 40mins to reach city on a holiday. Taxi back was 15mins and cost €13. Staff were friendly at check-in.

The place has many shady places, it is certainly not a beauty, but the sanitary facilities are clean and functional. The area is huge, you can walk the dog for over 30 minutes and still not have seen everything. The swimming pool was not yet filled at the beginning of April.

Shower water cold in the evening. Positive, the good connection to the city by bus and water, sewage and electricity on the somewhat small pitches. Therefore only two stars. Were here for three days and were able to visit Lisbon and Sintra extensively with the Lisbon Card.,"
6411,1820137,4,nomaysuave,14/04/2022,"The campsite is fine, €37 per night with a campervan, you get electricity. The bathrooms are fine and the showers are all correct. We had to put shims to level. There is a bus to go to the center, but it passes little and takes a long time, better taxi that you can order there and they do not charge you much."

Yes, it's noisy, but it's right in a big city with great connections. Everything is clean and the staff tries to keep it clean, which unfortunately some campers don't manage to do. Nobody was rude here."
6411,1767168,3,RolandHerbertz,27/02/2022,The place is good and is very central to visit Lisbon and Sintra. There's really nothing to complain about if the absolute arrogance of the reception staff doesn't jump out at you and the advance payment policy is the 11th commandment. You should absolutely know in advance how long you want to stay and pay. It's not customer oriented.
6411,1764541,3,calle5621,24/02/2022,"It was fine for 2 nights. Outdated sanitary facilities but clean, small mini supermarket and restaurant. Got bread rolls and croissants in the morning, all good."

6411,1716168,4,NinJoe,26/12/2021,"We had pitch E23 and stayed 5 nights. Yes, you can hear the road and the planes, but our place wasn't really annoying. I think it's louder in other places. The sanitary facilities were cleaned several times a day and are in good condition. The bus is a good way to get into the city. Behind it a large park, in which you can go for a great walk. € 20.8 for 2PP + dog."

Showers had hot water in the men’s, but women’s were more varied. The drinking water taps gave you weird tasting water so we did not use them. It is next to a busy road which can be heard but did not keep us awake. Would use again purely for safety and ease of access to city."
6411,1695861,5,Edze,22/11/2021,"Really good for a campsite in the city. Each pitch has electricity and water. A person with a van costs just under € 17. If you want to see Lisbon and don't want to worry about your camper, it's a great place!"
6411,1694465,4,half48,21/11/2021,"Very nice, well-maintained campsite, very clean toilets and showers, well-demarcated and shaded places, concrete coating for the motorhome (well, people who understand that we do not want to bring dirt inside)"
6411,1690239,3,LesMartibert,15/11/2021,You can tell it's the only campsite in the area! € 27.30 per night! But the location and the services are good. We were quite happy until the first night arrived ... A noise around 11:30 pm. There is a strap from an open bicycle. We tried to steal them luckily we heard! So little advice don't leave anything of value out !! Long live Lisbon !!
6411,1683627,3,prinjaum,09/11/2021,"At the beginning of November, we paid 27.30 euros / day for a motorhome with 2 people. electricity and hot water included. To reach Lisbon we used Uber / - 10 euros per trip. It is expensive but at least the motorhome is safe and you can access all the areas to visit. There is a fast food restaurant on site. All the staff are super nice and get by in French"
6411,1666315,4,brijac76,28/10/2021,"Very nice campsite but very expensive, friendly welcome (in French). Huge and quiet campsite. Very beautiful pitches delimited and spaced with electricity and individual water. Very clean sanitary facilities. Large swimming pool (+ € 2.00 for a deckchair). Restaurant, supermarket, kennel ... bus at the door of the campsite for the center of lisbon about 30 minutes. Exorbitant price: end of September 35.30 € / night for"
6411,1653989,5,Horst0815,20/10/2021,"Large, well-kept campsite. Each pitch has electricity, water, a bench and a large park right next door. Hypermarket (Auchan supermarket) about 30 minutes on foot (past the Decathlon and Ikea). Open on Sundays. Open air restaurant right next door, live music until evening (~ 11 p.m.). Way to Lisbon with bus line 750 to Colegio Militar, there by metro to the center (day ticket bus metro for 6.9eur)."
6411,1653592,3,Dopazina,20/10/2021,27 € for a camper pitch and 2 people seems exaggerated during the low season. The bathrooms need a thorough cleaning. Every night there is blaring live music in the hotel next door until 11pm. Unfortunately it is the only option near Lisbon.
6411,1650243,3,audreycalys,18/10/2021,"Expensive but that is the price for the region. A word of advice, take only 1 night, it is possible that the same evening you will have a free one night paper for one more night…. The pool, even for children, is very cold in this season too bad that for this price it is not heated nor the large one. The animal park and games are also closed… I would have stayed longer if not… 4th bus to the center"
6411,1650205,1,larsahlberg,17/10/2021,"Tired camping with very loud music until midnight from a hotel. The hotel was right by the campsite. Impossible to sleep, unfortunately there are not many options in Lisbon"

6411,1643480,3,ML35,14/10/2021,"Well, let's not hide it, there aren't many other options for visiting Lisbon. We found this campsite expensive compared to what you can find in Portugal. It is on the other hand good, except for the locations a little close to the road and quite narrow (we were close to each other) The hotel next door is super noisy! easy access by bus to Lisbon"
6411,1638517,5,gerardomdz,11/10/2021,"Great, I'd say one of the best I've been to. Very wide streets, large plots, concrete, with gray water and drainage. Very well connected by bus. Gigantic pool. Very clean and cared for. We do not use the services"
6411,1637687,5,Snuugs0401,10/10/2021,"Absolutely satisfied - large places with shade or partial shade, every place concreted, water and electricity and a picnic bench at every place. Showers etc very clean, if it's dirty then unfortunately only because you (or wife) leave it dirty ... With a clean pool etc ... The price is probably due to the lack of competition, we think (27 € without discount) absolutely reasonable!"
6411,1633059,4,denden85,08/10/2021,"Super top campsite, very clean, friendly welcome, accepts ACSI 10 to 30% discount on the price, for 7 nights camper van 2 people and a car € 22.50 per night, service to Lisbon from the campsite. Visit of Lisbon with a 2-day Yelloh bus pass € 22 per person (bus, tram 28.35 and others ect). On average 40 to 60 minutes by bus depending on the hours to reach Lisbon."
6411,1632694,3,raulmr51,08/10/2021,"Good campsite with all services. The squares are being too big they are fine. The clean, correct services The price 35 euros per night seems high to me, that is why I give it 3 stars, since the quality price does not deserve a higher rating."
6411,1631328,2,Masterptk,07/10/2021,"Nice to see Lisbon. For the price, the place is very, very old!"
6411,1620967,3,danmccabe102,01/10/2021,"Its convenient having services on every pitch, and being 45 minutes from Lisbon centre on the 714 bus, but €32 per night is pretty steep and the music from the hotel went on until 2am - even for a 28yo on a thursday night it was loud."
6411,1618698,4,Cric29,30/09/2021,"Perfect place to visit Lisbon with the 714 bus. Very clean sanitary facilities, cleaned several times a day. Very pleasant swimming pool. A little noise with cars on the neighboring roads and music in the evening until 11pm. Each pitch has electricity, water and meat sewage. Several cassette emptying points on the campsite. Alright, don't hesitate to stop there."
6411,1616061,4,Papyducati,29/09/2021,"Good, clean campsite with all the amenities on the pitch for water and drainage. Hard and practically flat ground. Very practical for visiting the surroundings. The noise of the road after the visits and the aperitif is no longer a problem. 35 € per day all inclusive electricity, swimming pool etc."
6411,1607437,3,entropie,25/09/2021,"Very practical for visiting Lisbon and Sintra in complete safety, bus stops at the door of the campsite. The pitches, in a park, are large with water, electricity and drainage. Small downside the noise of the road during the day, the music every evening from 19 to 23:00 in the adjacent hotel but it is very bearable."
6411,1598492,2,Rubiocks74,22/09/2021,Expensive but there is nothing more suitable to visit Lisbon and leave the motorhome safe
6411,1588530,3,sacuma,18/09/2021,"It is very close to Lisbon, this makes it functional, there are two toilet areas, mine were fine and cleaned several times a day (look for plots from 1 to 20) True about the music, it is from a nearby Hotel, also because of the tomorrow music to 8'30 children from colonias. Well connected Bus and Hubber, fast and cheap. Police security, we were fine"
6411,1581348,1,devroede,15/09/2021,"I've never seen anything like it totally rotten. I wouldn't even bathe my dog in the showers. For fresh water you have to walk 100 m up stairs down stairs. Dispose of everything that is in disrepair, just drive on. At the special price of € 25 per night. Outrageous"
6411,1570556,3,happyflo,12/09/2021,"Camping with large pitches with water, electricity, table and benches, the rest of the services are old but they work, the toilets smell bad, inside the campsite there is an enclosure where they play loud music until 11:30 p.m. hear the sound of cars passing by the road outside the campsite, we have paid for 2 nights, 2 people, plus motorhome 54 €."
6411,1562456,3,IlmaOnTour,09/09/2021,"The campsite was perfectly okay. He is definitely getting on in years, but the staff was very friendly with us. The sanitary facilities were ok too. Paid one night for € 27. With Uber we went downtown for € 7. The campsite is very central. The music is loud, but it ends at 10/23 p.m. The campsite is well thought out, it's a shame that it is not maintained."
6411,1561521,4,Reisevogel1,09/09/2021,"Great space, asphalt floor, every space has water and electricity, table and bench. New sanitary facilities, plus washing up and washing facilities. No more music after 10 p.m."
6411,1560575,2,Califurgo,08/09/2021,The facilities are in dire need of an update and a thorough cleaning. Impossible to go to sleep soon because there is a bar next door that does concerts every day we were there. You will have the concert inside your van… Asphalt pitches. The only good thing that is in a forest and the truth is that it is beautiful
6411,1556602,1,simonhelaouet,07/09/2021,"Did not go! not very well received by the hostess although that is her job. Toilet not clean (shit ...), shower that changes temperature without doing anything, sometimes we have the right to a cold shower ... moreover, the campsite threw our chairs and table, why ?! a lot of noise at night really a lot!"
6411,1517555,1,ameliesoe,27/08/2021,"Unfortunately, the campsite is not recommended at all. The disco next door plays very loud music until late at night. Everything looks neglected and also dirty the sanitary facilities. The staff was rude."
6411,1517543,1,greyjumper,27/08/2021,It was dirty and they didn’t Open all showers and toilets but it was fully booked. Some places are all time really loud because they are directly at a highway. Bonus is that the place is neighbor with a night club and you get on some days really loud shitty music till 23-24pm.We will definitely look for another place next time we come to Lissabon!
6411,1513397,3,Petitbonhomme,26/08/2021,Good base for visiting Lisbon and leaving the vans in a safe place! Caretaker 24 hours a day! Bus nearby. Poorly maintained campsite but generally passable. Water on site which does not work well! Attention wasp and brush against! Swimming pool but we are not allowed to put the towel down wherever we want! And a bit expensive for one night!
6411,1493532,4,vwafrica,21/08/2021,"Very well equipped campsite. The sanitary facilities are very clean and functional. Each site has an electricity connection, a water supply and a level concrete slab. All the services one would expect from a campsite are there: swimming pool, mini market, laundromat and small restaurant (more than full menu for € 8.50!) Only downside: the price € 46 / night for a van and 3 people !"
6411,1491162,2,KarlHunter,21/08/2021,"Quite nice facilities and moderately clean. Good size pitch with electric and water. loud music all night from the restaurant. OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE! 2 people, small camper, 1 night (around 12 hours), 43Euro... daylight robbery"
6411,1484543,2,kaced66,19/08/2021,"If you have no other option like us, ok, but if not, run away! Noise all night long between 1 party nearby, the airport and the road. The swimming pool is only open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. The cafeteria is sad as is the grocery store. And in all fairness it's expensive! for 1 van, 1 night and 4 people (2 adults and 2 teenagers): 70 €"
6411,1475507,2,Paso,18/08/2021,"Not worth the 4 stars, expensive, dilapidated (just the toilets have been renovated, they are clean and hot showers) large swimming pool but since it is a municipal campsite a lot of local visitors. On the other hand, practical for spending time in Lisbon equipped with electric bikes, a cycle path (almost complete) of about 9 km takes us to the center. Stay 2 nights for 3 (1child 13 years old) 92 €"
6411,1473753,4,Laurasia,17/08/2021,"08.2021 Very pleasant campsite at reasonable prices for a capital (around 45 € with a converted truck, a couple and 3 children). In a forest, the sound of cicadas covers that of the road during the day. Large swimming pool, clean toilets with hot water and pressure, well shaded. Close to the main road accesses (Cascais, Sintra) and 7 minutes from the Belem district."
6411,1472297,3,Picuak,17/08/2021,"Correct, maybe expensive but it is in Lisbon easy access to the city, it is best to use Uber or Cabify to go to the city, just a detail, it is not allowed to make fire barbecues, not it. otherwise good plot with electricity and water € 41 the day leveled and at ease"
6411,1470935,4,fasylves,17/08/2021,"Hello, currently at the municipal campsite in Lisbon, this campsite is a bit noisy due to its proximity to the road, but some pitches are quieter. I have two children aged 8 and 12, and we sleep very well, there is entertainment for children, swimming pool, nature, restaurant, laundromat, mini market, everything for a campsite, it's a city campsite, do not forget it !! With a very natural side. Very clean toilets, I will try to share the photos! Good holidays."
6411,1457151,1,Johannasanne,14/08/2021,So I'm really shocked. For this price (33 € the night) absolutely not to be recommended. Unpleasant people. Very loud music all day long (from a neighbor event). The sanitary facilities (especially for washing dishes) are totally filthy and neglected and are more reminiscent of a homeless shelter in their condition. Definitely not to be recommended.
6411,1455978,4,Txemiten,14/08/2021,"An urban campsite, correct for the services they offer, possibly a tad expensive. The entrances are closely guarded, the municipal police monitor the interior as it is a municipal campsite. You can leave your car here and go very calm to visit Lisbon. Bus stops for both Sintra and Lisbon at 300m. Reception. Do not expect a Resort but as a correct urban camping."
6411,1434529,3,olivier85sago,10/08/2021,"We have just arrived this morning ,,, worried by the previous comments ,,, we are very pleasantly surprised ,,, the place is immaculate and maintained ,,,, friendly welcome and speaks French in addition ,,, swimming pool and impeccable sanitary, ,, at the height for a drop-off point in Lisbon ,,,,"
6411,1408481,3,mycool,05/08/2021,"They offer you two rates, free camping with cement and water and electricity (few places) the rest in a dry area. For 32 euros, camper and two people. Or 40 on a plot with water and electricity and a walkway with tables and wooden benches. The baths between one and the other is night and day. Although you can use the ones you want, the only thing that you will have to walk a little more. Noisy for nearby highway."
6411,1407104,4,Steffontheroad,05/08/2021,"Good to visit Lisbon. Not as bas as some ppl write... Bathroom good, just the motorway is a bit loud but it's a city campside... We paid 32 Euro for 2 Persons and a Campervan that's not unusal for a city. Take an UBER to the city centre, pay 5-10 Euro and enjoy Lisbon!"
6411,1401521,2,Liekepeternoot,04/08/2021,"Not worth the 23 euros per night (1 van, 1 adult, no electricity). The bathrooms are okay but the campsite needs maintenance and seems like it's left alone for a long time. There's a bar/restaurant in the middle of the camping with very loud music, so it's actually nice there's an evening clock haha."
6411,1399985,3,Silfus,03/08/2021,"Nice parking with shaded areas. Toilets clean, showers with hot water. Package for motorhome, 2 adults per night 41,80€: the package consists of a spot with all services including electricity and use of swimming pool."
6411,1395917,3,zoearg,02/08/2021,It offers loading and unloading service without overnight stay for € 7.30
6411,1393694,2,ptaylor420,02/08/2021,Good position for getting into Lisbon however its situated right next to a very loud bar. as well as that we woke up in the morning to 20 children from a camp expedition sitting on our picnic table 5 ft from the van playing music and eating. can't recommend this campsite unless you really need it.
6411,1376169,1,stepway64,28/07/2021,"I wonder how we can ask to pay for that! Campsite which seems abandoned: unmaintained green spaces, dilapidated and dirty sanitary facilities, loud music in the bar which is against the campsite (earplugs will not be available to you. no help given the volume), and therefore a very high price for the service. We come there because we have no other choice in Lisbon ....."
6411,1350730,3,sweetsayaka,22/07/2021,Good place to spend a night near Lisbon city. It has all the services. It is very expensive.
6411,1324282,1,Krouge,14/07/2021,The only positive thing is the fact that we can visit Lisbon without worry! For the rest we will not come back. The rates are outrageous and the front desk staff just on the edge! Go elsewhere !!!!
6411,1316082,5,carcanogar,12/07/2021,"We were pleasantly surprised. The squares are very wide, they are level (or at least they try), they have water and electricity and a table and a picnic area next to it. The toilets are cleaned quite a few times a day and are usually clean. Two buses to the center at the door. Pool included."
6411,1302237,4,piazzagiu,07/07/2021,"Nice place to spend a night, clean sanitary, motorhome pitch with water and individual current, visit of Belem and Docks with the bus near the campsite"
6411,1205203,1,SergioFcs,18/05/2021,"Poorly maintained campsite: tall grass on the pitches, old and dirty toilets. Every second shower is functional. Music all day long and until 2 am on Saturday evening in the bar along the campsite. If you are looking for tranquility, avoid especially as it is expensive (35 € per night for 1 CC and 2 people)"
6411,1190771,2,Perdi2xelmundo,09/05/2021,"The campsite conveys a great sense of neglect: tall uncut grasses, dilapidated utility buildings, all very poorly maintained. Also, expensive, € 35 a night for a motorhome and two people. On a positive note, electricity and water in each motorhome pitch. It has the advantage of being the only camping in Lisbon."
6411,1174227,3,andreporelo,15/04/2021,"€ 5.85 for water spills, refilling and emptying the motorhome cassette."
6411,1098422,1,manzoru,19/10/2020,"I give it a star for the location. By uber 6e you get to the center in 6 minutes. The campsite is nowhere to be found. Since you have pitches for motorhomes, at least they are clean man. It costs a lot to sleep but due to the noise of the highway that is right next to the campsite. 27e the night in low season that I would not pay again. Dirt all over the place"
6411,1095973,5,Ahiru,17/10/2020,"Camping with spacious pitches. It has all the services. It is not close to the center but it has the bus stop to visit Lisbon, ask at reception and they will explain. If you want to sleep in Lisbon and have your car parked to visit Lisbon, I recommend this campsite, it is worth paying for it. Leaving the campsite at 4pm at least in winter. I recommend it!"
6411,1094994,4,SMXpro52,16/10/2020,"We spent two nights there, the toilets and showers were spotless. It is a large campsite full of trees and each plot has water, electricity and a table with wooden benches. The only dirt that we could see was the remains of branches and leaves on the ground, everything else all correct. No complaints (13/14 October 2020)"
6411,1086264,4,Freewind650,08/10/2020,We were there with the mobile home in early October 2020. The place is like a park. The parking spaces are specially or with composite stones and are almost level. The sanitary facilities are well renovated and very clean. The place is closed with a barrier and porter. Bus 714 into the city runs from the square to the center. I can't confirm the bad reviews.
6411,1071304,5,angelhernandez51,26/09/2020,"We found it to be a good campsite. Very very wide, it is like a giant forest. The giant squares with light and water. The staff were very sieso We didn't even see the bathrooms because we were going in AC They make excursions to Sintra from the Uber campsite to Lisbon for 8 euros Unofficial restaurant right at the end of the ultra-lively campsite (Monsanto open air)"
6411,1069893,4,JYE19,26/09/2020,"Good campsite with large pitches. It is a forest with what I consider natural is full of leaves and bits of branches. The ""alveoli"" squares are wide and give you privacy with other campers. The services were clean. When making the online reservation we overpaid, we discussed it and they returned the money. € 140 for one ac and two adults for four nights, personally I don't think it is expensive."
6411,1068244,1,Tat.crd,24/09/2020,"This campsite does not deserve better, its price is exaggerated compared to the services: 2 nights at the end of September, 28 € 2pers tent sees. there was no hot water and homeless people squatted in the toilets / showers with loud music and beer cans everywhere. We did not feel safe, with the constant passage of people from outside the campsite. For the bus it is quite practical with the 714"
6411,989639,1,Gontzal9,21/08/2020,"Very low quality / price campsite. € 65 2 nights 2 adults with van. In general everything very neglected, lack of maintenance. I would not return, too expensive for what it offers. What you pay is the location, since it is in the heart of Lisbon."
6411,942352,1,clarapepette,09/08/2020,"Very expensive per night (50 €) and 1 hour from Lisbon by bus. We made a U-turn to reach a private parking area for motorhomes located in the East, at 15 € per night, 15min by bus from the center of Lisbon. A wonderful place, with restaurant and bar, all necessary amenities, we really would have missed something on our way to the campsite."
6411,938820,1,bienmesabe,08/08/2020,"41 euros per night, we visit it and the quality does not correspond to the money they ask for. very far from the center (one hour by bus) and supermarkets far too. there are better alternatives (and much cheaper)"
6411,913072,1,Carlos1974,30/07/2020,"Very bad experience, we have been in summer, and it really is unbearable. There are summer schools, and easily more than 200 children gather, distributed in groups throughout the campsite. They arrive at 8 in the morning and stay until 8 at night, the bathroom is restricted to 4 people by the covid, and that situation is unsustainable. It is expensive for what it offers."
6411,882103,1,guigui-76,19/07/2020,"We stopped here to visit Lisbon. Except for the fact that the bus is close, the rest is horrible. The campsite is not maintained, the toilets are dirty, the swimming pool is open to everyone and frequented by a whole population ... campers cannot therefore enjoy it calmly, this campsite is really to be avoided!"
6411,855356,4,alhaurina,08/07/2020,"Good camping, squares and wide streets, with shadows and flat and easy parking, ac and 3 people € 48."
6411,793046,3,Romeonora,08/03/2020,If you want to know Porto and enjoy this great. What maintenance and camping is a kaka since it is all without maintenance and without cleaning.

6411,788994,4,unschoolers,01/03/2020,"Ps: at the end of February 2020 we paid 33 € for a motorhome, 2 children and 2 adults / night."
6411,788993,4,unschoolers,01/03/2020,"Camping in the middle of magnificent trees. Each plot has a picnic table, drinking water, gray water outlet (if you have a hose for otherwise it is at the end of the campsite for emptying), a lighting spot and a trash can. Washing machine for € 4.5 and dryer for € 3.5 correct reception, bus nearby, 1 hour to go to the heart of town. The showers and toilets are clean. The only downside: the regular bulking of cars due to the proximity to the road. Guard at the entrance to check the bracelets and only let those from the campsite. Concerning myself, it was perfect to be able to go and visit Lisbon without fear that my motorhome would be burgled."
6411,781989,3,jacknight,17/02/2020,"Indeed the reception is not the warmest and the price rather exorbitant. Normal, they are in a monopoly position but the advantage is the bus to the city center. A word of advice: when you arrive at the terminus, go to the ""Casa da Sorte"" to take the Viva Viagem pass for 24 hours, 48 hours ... at a very favorable rate (all transport)."
6411,780801,2,Helton,15/02/2020,"The only reason to stop here is the proximity to the centre of Lisbon. It's expensive and rundown, though the toilet facilities were clean. Feels like a communist version of a campsite, including the welcome"
6411,780377,2,LucaFiechter,14/02/2020,The lack of competition is clearly noticeable with a lack of cleanliness and friendliness in this place.
6411,780263,4,catfab,14/02/2020,"Camping very well. All amenities are present, water and electricity at each motorhome location. Very correct price."

6411,773237,3,tktoto,27/01/2020,"Who wants to visit Lisbon almost inevitably ends up here to stand safely. The street noise is always there, otherwise everything is getting a bit old."
6411,770788,4,Mokca,20/01/2020,It has the merit of existing. Out of season 19 € per night for a Van and 2 people for 8 nights. Friendly staff for the rest it is to everyone's appreciation!
6411,770470,2,Pascal84,19/01/2020,"What to say ??? BOF ... it has the merit of existing to visit Lisbon with peace of mind, Bus about 300m 2 € to go to the city center. Correct location concrete with water and electricity 27 € per night for a van and 2 people."
6411,768626,3,snowboarder6,14/01/2020,It's big and you have traffic noise but it's close to the city. sanitary was not so good. shower always changed from hot to cold and so on.
6411,762052,1,millievanilli,02/01/2020,"Terrible camping, 38€ in off season for a small camper and 2 people. The restaurant had no food left at 3pm, the mini Market was practically empty.

6411,752190,3,rociopiopio,09/12/2019,A campsite about 40 minutes by bus (line 714: € 2 per head) from the center of Lisbon. The plots are small and asphalted. With a small pile to scrub outside and a little white stone type picnic. The bathrooms were a bit old and grungy. I found a spoon in my shower. There is wifi in the bar area.

Unmotivated staff, many bad spaces, run down sanitary facilities in Germany probably due to health concerns would be closed (including Heavily moldy ceiling). Locks in the toilets and showers were broken or missing. In addition, expensive (30 € for a pitch, 2 people) where not even space is the awning extend or set up a table). We left after 2 nights (3 paid) prematurely. Unfortunately, there is no alternative. Shame on you Lisboa!"
6411,697116,3,amantares,19/09/2019,"Good place to visit Lisbon but a little expensive for the services that we use the Motorhome, the nearby bus, but keep in mind that from the campsite to the center it takes about an hour"

Odd for a September 18th usually it's cooler ... too many pensioners probably."

The price may seem expensive but it is practically the only good option to visit Lisbon. The bathrooms old but clean. We didn't bathe in the pool but it looked pretty good. Drain and tank filling quite comfortable. Very friendly employees. Something to improve, reform in the bathrooms (although quite clean) In general, the campsite. As they said 714 bus 200 meters to go to the center of Lisbon."
6411,686752,5,DIVERPAT,11/09/2019,"34 € the night. The pitches are rather flat and equipped with a plug and a tap of drinking water. Some locations are also equipped with a picnic table. Unlike the previous comments very clean sanitary. The pitches are shaded under the eucalyptus trees. A bit of traffic noise due to the proximity of the 4 lanes but nothing too bad ... certainly one of the easiest and safest ways to visit Lisbon. We booked 2 nights, the second night we were offered a promo: 1 night more with 1 extra night free. In the end we stayed 4 nights."
6411,682545,3,dvznh,09/09/2019,"Good option to visit Lisbon and Surroundings if you want to forget about driving on cobbled roads or find a place around the Center. As for security, they have access control and some days there was even Municipal Police around the enclosure. We found it a bit expensive for what it offers, personally I think they know the only option in the surroundings and take advantage of it. Bus 714 to the Center. Taxi / Uber approx € 10/12 to the Center (especially if you are going back later from the last bus)."

The worst are the toilets that have not been washed for a long time and the showers with moths and broken ones. The app does not let me upload a photo but I even found a dog in the shower, I could not believe it! In addition the plots are super sloping and if you want a paved plot worth € 10 more per night and are equally inclined A TRUE SCAM! The only good thing is the bus that is next door and takes you to the center € 2 each way line 714 and it's 40 minutes. We have come in August and everything was taken but if you plan to come in time, I advise you to look at a hotel that will be a bit more expensive but it will be worth it"
6411,667116,1,Yanik,29/08/2019,"Summary: KATASTROPHE We've been in the camper for 5 months now and not tricky, but we've never seen anything like it. 1st price very very expensive (38 € for 2p van) 2nd toilets are very dirty 3.

A lot of shade is appreciated in summer. the bus at the same exit of the campsite. Come on ... for me great. who does not like the possible inconvenience that can take you in front of a hotel about € 80 a night
6411,653637,1,Felianna,23/08/2019,Would Not recommend this place at all. Disgusting bathrooms!! I personally would rather die than spend one more night here
6411,651089,1,Indian21,22/08/2019,A shame about camping. With how well located it is and the attentive and friendly staff they have. What works best. That's why I put the star. The pitiful facilities. Broken and very dirty bathrooms. The showers very poorly hygienic. Broken the tiles. Black to take years without being cleaned in conditions. Full of mold. A shame. Camping very abandoned. Very uneven and dirty. Dirty papers and trash flew constantly on the floor. Water intakes with faucets removed. With many slopes and uncomfortable. I cannot recommend it until they make a reform or improvement restructuring. Or a good cleaning.
6411,648598,1,extr4bigfoot,21/08/2019,Certe is the only campsite. From the reception we have the impression of annoying them. Short. Rates are very expensive for two adults two children two nights over 100 euros. For a 4 star nothing exceptional. We go to the pool person on the sunbeds I ask to get one and the surprise charge extra I have never seen that. I'm not even talking about the location next to the expressway. Sanitary rather clean. We use HUBER drivers to get to the city center which is cheaper than taking the bus at 4 and it saved us time.
6411,647970,3,breizhil,21/08/2019,"Nice welcome, good place proposed very correct space despite the age of the campsite, not too steep on cement slab, camping table, bollard lighting, water tap, black water drain (gray water with a hose if one has one). All this on individual site. Sanitary clean, noise of the highway not too present because we were the opposite of this one. The price is probably high but we are at the gates of Lisbon. € 77.60 / 2 nights / 2 people (Discover 73 LM). We did not test the bus because we move on a motorcycle."

6411,646014,5,nachomernes,20/08/2019,Camping good to visit Lisbon. Very quiet and very large plots with electricity and water. Great pool and attentive staff. It does not deserve as many reviews as I have read.

6411,633150,1,M73,16/08/2019,"The only good thing about this campsite is that it has the bus stop at 100m and takes you to the center of Lisbon in about 30 '. The rest is HORRIBLE. Uneven plots (it is a mountain). Some have a wooden bench table, but most are broken. The bathrooms ... I've never seen anything like it in 40 years as a camper. Balls of hair everywhere, curtains with 30 cm of mold in the showers, buckets of black water to ""scrub"" the floors, mops that come under the doors when you try to use the toilet ... the toilets are disgusting . I really put a star because it doesn't let me put less to send the comment. I would recommend any area or parking before this campsite."

Not cheap (we paid 80 euros for two nights, two adults and two children) that's true, but it's clean, every place has electricity, water supply and disposal. There is also city noise, mainly due to the city highway, so it is recommended to ask for further places inside. How did not find it tragic ... Especially since it is a city campsite. The staff are very friendly, they speak very good English and for children there is a pool and a playground. Who wants to do laundry can do that, cost per machine 4.50 euros. The machines are new. The course is also secured, for us the best option to stand and visit Lisbon. Have you some pictures packed."
6411,612896,3,totofetnadevire,09/08/2019,"Without reservation, complete camping site, we were offered a tent location of our choice. Sanitary outdated but correct. Effectively, the highway passes near but the pines attenuated the noise. 4 adults and a camper at 44.50 a night, a bit pricey for Portugal but the pool is big and the 714 bus that stops 100 meters to the right of the campsite takes you to the city center."

We looked for a place more or less suitable for an hour and no one to tell us the place. The noises of others thoroughly and nobody to monitor. Unload water and toilets just degeulase because not clean (you will find yourself with your feet in the middle of the excrement of others). The worst campsite we found and the most expensive. It's exorbitant.

(4 € / person) camping very noisy, the double lane passes right next door and the hum of cars is incessant. When we arrived, we asked for an alveolus, we were told it was complete, however the next day when we left, at least a 10th cell was still empty. In fact, he piled us all on top of each other. personal not the most friendly. in short, the website is really very well done, a nice scam, but the only one to visit Lisbon.

Bus 2 € and 45 minutes journey with the station quite far. Really cheap taxi: to do Belem / Castelo Sao Jorge paid € 11.50 for 4 people."
6411,542330,4,ademortier,07/07/2019,"The price is high but unique camping that allows you to visit Lisbon with the bus 714, 500 m on the right which arrives place of the trade to see absolutely. The 750 bus next to the entrance will take you to the International Park. Then you can make your choice. Taxis are not expensive. Correct campsite with large water and electricity sites. The toilets are dated but suitable."
6411,536082,1,samattwellnz,02/07/2019,"Extremely over priced campground 20minutes taxi or 40minute bus to the centre. Loud with the motorway right there. Plenty of services. Campervan site is not very even, showers/toilets outdated. €49 for 4people with electricity"
6411,527441,3,MarieB100,24/06/2019,Place is ok. But quite expensive.
6411,525865,4,marina72,23/06/2019,"Friendly welcome. Cheap and good restaurant, with morning menu for lunch and dinner. Supermarket, laundry, medical center on site. Taxi to 10 € to reach the campsite from the center of Lisboa, there is also a bus 5min from the campsite, 2 € / person, more than 40min against 15 / 20min by taxi. The pitches have access to electricity and water, with trash and table (picnic type) for each location. Sanitary well maintained cleaned several times a day. Many activities offered, possibility to rent bicycles. Reduction 10% acsi. 2person, 1 truck, wifi, electricity, pool access, 3 days, 92 €."
6411,525590,3,BieneMaja,23/06/2019,"As the only sure way to explore Lisbon we have chosen this place. Price rather high. You can hear flight and street noise. Camping is huge, pitches rather small but with direct water and electricity and table. Restaurant very cheap but nice. Bus stop in front of the campsite. Showers hot but very tight."
6411,520399,4,patetmarie,18/06/2019,Very quiet even if the facilities date a little it's true. Nothing to say about cleanliness. To go on Lisbon dinner return by taxi at any time of night 8 € night rate so at 4 cheaper than the bus. To do without fear apart from driving taxis that encourages to be a believer.
6411,517559,3,DaniFromSwiss,16/06/2019,"The only camping in Lisbon, has absurd prices, for one night we paid 34 euros in 2 for the van, of course there are all the services, even more than necessary, nice environment for those with children.

6411,516880,4,Justwalker,15/06/2019,"We were on the night of June 13. Good place to visit Lisbon. Everything is clean, it is safe and it is easy to go and return to the city by bus, taxi or Uber. The price was 34 euros for a Camper and two adults. The bus costs 2 euros per trip and a Uber 9 euros at 10:00 at night."
6411,516284,3,matemyla,15/06/2019,"Very rudimentary campsite whose locations are poorly maintained. all sanitary are old but clean. sufficient. the proximity of the device leaves a permanent muffled noise. on the other hand very convenient to go to the center of Lisbon by bus. less than 5 min walk stop 714 takes you in 40min to the heart of Lisbon. all 15 minutes last return, 22:30. quite expensive for a 2 nights van (2 adults, 1 child) = 75 €"

Bus to the city very convenient. the pitches at the bottom of the campsite are very good, big and with tables and electrical connection and water.

6411,502880,4,ClaudiAlinaGregor,03/06/2019,"Very central place, sanitary facilities were OK but not the newest. First got place H2, I think that are the places for those who only stay one night, very small and secluded under trees. Have exchanged again, which went without problems. It was quite expensive at the end of May with over 30 € (motorhome with 2 persons and electricity), but with the ACSI card we saved 10% very good pool"
6411,500798,4,Paxy,02/06/2019,"Ideal campsite to visit Lisbon and because it is the only one, the price is related (34 euros for 2 with electricity). We can blame the atmosphere that is not too warm and sanitary that does not work very well. We can note the good security of the site (guards permanently) and the services (drain gray water, electricity and water on location)."
6411,498881,1,joelledeve,31/05/2019,"I do not recommend this campsite: clean sanitary but problems locks, evacuation ... the noise continues to the ring road nearby and to finish tonight, music party in the restaurant behind the campsite with all cars parked in the camp-site next to the sites of the motorhomes with the agreement of the officials of the camp-site! I do not know if we are going to end the night here"

6411,488221,4,chimie,20/05/2019,"Very convenient, secure, we enjoyed the quiet night. the maintenance of the spaces leaves something to be desired: electrical terminals and broken bins, picnic tables would need maintenance, grass not mowed, etc .. pity because this place would be the top."
6411,484030,4,ambrolau,14/05/2019,"To spend a few days keeping the motorhome safe is a good place. Leaving the campsite on the right hand side going up a small slope is the bus stop that goes to the center of Lisbon. The line is 714 outurela-pc.figueira. The ""Carris"" application gives detailed information about bus lines, stops and schedules. It works very well."
6411,483058,4,catre37,13/05/2019,"We stayed for 3 nights, the 4th was not offered as previously mentioned. With the ACSI card we got 10% which is 30 € per night.

To take the tram 28 get off at RS Paolo (Bica) and take the funicular Bica."
6411,476741,3,Felys,05/05/2019,"We have just stayed 4 nights and are quite happy. the plots are large and shady. For 3 nights paid they offer the 4th, which amounts to 26euros / night (otherwise 34 euros). Normal rate for Portugal and Spain (campsites are much cheaper in France). The facilities are clean but old !! . Only problem, proximity to the highway that generates a lot of noise."
6411,475007,4,renacca42,03/05/2019,"We are there these days 2 people electric hookup and water on each site at 32 €. It's always too much, but with a good welcome on arrival, compared to the campsites offered at Notre Capitale, it's cheaper with good facilities, large wooded areas, swimming pool, playgrounds self with a hearty menu at 8.50 € ... There are certe some renovations to make or / and in progress."
6411,474756,4,MLav,03/05/2019,"We spent 3 quiet nights at this rather pleasant campsite. Admittedly, it is expensive, but well located to visit Lisbon and Sintra by all the transports. The pitches are big. A few negatives: the purring of the highway, but we still slept well, and the showers deserve a little renovation. Otherwise very good."
6411,474340,1,chap6883,03/05/2019,"Weekend of May 1, 2019. Camping very expensive given its location and the continual noise of the highway 32 €? 2 people and 1 van. To advise against very strongly. With a van or a small motorhome look for another location in town or to the cemetery car park that allows you to reach downtown by metro"
6411,473121,4,Katja1234,01/05/2019,"We had 2 great nights here. Campsite is very nice and at your pitch you have water, el and a picnictable. We took the bus to Lissabon - 2 euro pr. Person one way. On the downside: showers could use a make over. Everything else was nice and clean - and soap and toiletpapir in wc."
6411,472947,3,ger3553,01/05/2019,"Large shaded campsite. Dear, but they have the monopoly. 34,20 € / day. (1 camper and 2 adults). Old sanitary but correct. We are the 1st of May and the lawns are 30 cm high on the pitches. The maintenance of the park leaves something to be desired. Count 1 hour by bus to Lisbon (35 stops), for 2 euros. If we stay 3 nights, they offer the 4th."
6411,469041,4,brujo76,27/04/2019,"Despite some negative reviews, we were not disappointed: welcome, great location with electricity and individual water station, old but clean sanitary. Negative point: the incessant background noise of the traffic, but little annoying in this season where we live little outside. Only frequenting campsites very exceptionally, our judgment may be distorted"

6411,462331,3,Yasmina37,21/04/2019,This campsite has exclusivity in Lisbon which explains the prohibitive price We paid € 48.60 per night for two adults and three children with electricity and all services. It was overpriced but allowed us to visit Lisbon for two days. The bus is right next to the campsite but we preferred to take the taxi making us gain 30 minutes ride for the same price
6411,459829,3,Lukil,19/04/2019,"There is no other campsite near Lisbon, so this is super expensive. € 63 for a Camper with 2 adults and 2 children for 2 days. The price includes light, use or not. The soil is not careful, it is difficult to find a flat area. Otherwise the bathrooms are a bit old, but clean at all times."
6411,457311,3,JJALM,17/04/2019,"Expensive but correct camping, bus stop nearby, are remodeling areas that look very abandoned so I imagine it will improve, noises in the areas that stick to the road.

I’m not sure why all the bad reviews either. It is a little pricey, but it’s a walk or bus ride away from central Lisbon, it’s safe, all services are included and the pitches are spacious. Seemed perfectly fine as a base for a few days in the city."

6411,431093,4,Pooky,19/02/2019,A bit expensive for one night (26 €) but great location (water + electricity) on each site. Bus 200 m to the city center of Lisbon.
6411,430823,2,12etc3.13,18/02/2019,Less worse than it looks as it is located on a direct bus route to Lisbon and clean sanitary facilities. But the pitches are impassable (too small and too steep) for ours

In return we have a generous plot, well separated from neighbors, shaded by generous eucalyptus (so no satellite reception for TV) but water, electricity and gray water evacuation at each location. In the balance advantage / disadvantage we consider to be largely profitable and very satisfied. And as moreover there is no alternative equivalent on Lisbon, as enjoy this site very well kept and secure."

And if they are dirty at night it is unfortunately not the fault of the campsite that cleans but users who leave the premises in pitiful conditions. calm despite the road passing by. The bar and cafeteria staff are lovely. the bus 714 actually is very convenient to visit the wonderful Lisbon. fare € 25.50 a night van and 2 people very ok. do not hesitate

6411,374555,1,MG79,15/09/2018,"To avoid (but it's practically the only campsite in Lisbon); noisy campsite located between the ring roads (noise day and night). Outside of the specific motorhome pitches, the pitches are not marked out, each parks as much as he can (sometimes in the aisles along the fence separating fast tracks) in any direction on a ground always steep on 3 to 5 cm of dried pine thorns. In case of fire, there will be victims especially since the staff do not know where you are in view of the ""free system"" placement, the lack of numbering and the extent of camping. To flee !"

The services are bad and not clean. The minimarket and the self-service are very dim and sad. In the afternoon in August there is no longer a decent place. The cost is salty: each person € 15.90 and the camper € 12.70."

Each space has its own water point, electricity and trash. The pool is large, there are people but normal in August, no? Negatives: The employee who takes care of the laundry is not very pleasant when it comes to closing time (early! At 18h the laundry must be finished otherwise it cuts off the current program). The toilets are clean at 17h and the morning less. We were in one of the blocks a priori the cleanest and indeed it was better than we expected seeing the comments. In summary of course we recommend it is not one of the best campsites but certainly not the worst either!"

This campsite is very outdated in every way but no choice of camping in the sense that there is only 1 campsite on the city. The reception is not great the reception is so we also receive a person who does not lend to our discourt. Direct we are told to go on tent pitches, in the mountains, not easy with a 7m DC. After half an hour of search we find a small place to park but with Max's hold and maneuvers. There is only one bathroom with 4 showers as old as they are. No hot water on the dishes. I even find cold water showers without partitions :-( On return to the reception the person so welcoming told me that they made resta for CC sites but they could not keep them short result the world everywhere loose in the campsite and perso I think everything is good for money.il is very rare that I note too hard but considering the price 45 € per night .... it deserved a little discourt. to finish the pool is dirty I do not speak of the adjoining sanitary they are hyper dirty otherwise the ponds are big enough .. Camping to avoid except to land for the city of the capital of Portugal"

The highway directly next to it you can hear clearly. On the whole, the place looks very run-down and, as so often, the monopoly of being the only campsite in Lisbon is shamelessly exploited. € 36.50 per night for a campervan with two people is too much.

The bus costs 1.85 per trip, and as a fact, we returned by taxi from the Belem tower for €7.10"
6411,185323,2,Nine34,26/08/2017,We arrived around 10am in the morning. We were sent without much detail to just place one arm in the air saying towards there. €53 for 5 and electricity. 3 people from the staff passed by us during the day and it was only at 1:20 a.m. that they came to tell us that at this location we had to add €8 more or go further up the campsite. The little one was already sleeping so he had to pay the extra. Deplorable sanitation. No campsite maintenance. Nice swimming pool for children and close to town. I won't go back
6411,185212,3,jeremysandra,26/08/2017,"Campsite not maintained, sanitary facilities and swimming pool in pitiful condition. Security lousy. People come in and out like a mill. The staff is not friendly at all"
6411,183291,3,gigistardust,23/08/2017,"Good for children, we spent a day and a night there, it's not a big village club, which suited us completely. Each pitch has a water point and a table with bench and electricity + trash can. Shaded campsite. €47 per night For 4 (2 adults, two children) you can leave the premises around 4 p.m. Outdoor game for children and skate park without ramps. Clean sanitary facilities. Advantages line right opposite to visit Lisbon quietly."
6411,183013,4,coutch87,23/08/2017,"Very good campsite for a capital. Many services. Swimming pool/golf/tennis/children's playground/mini-market/cafeteria (€8.50 starter, main course, dessert, bread, coffee or otherwise 15 plates offered à la carte. Not great gastronomy but served generously) Laundry machine (€3.50 without detergent, €4 with). Tumble dryer (€4.10)/bus very close to Lisbon center (€1.85 per trip in 45 minutes, otherwise UBER for around €10) Camping with 2 options: either free pitch but not necessarily flat on the heights of the shaded campsite with electricity more or less nearby (€20 for 1 campervan, 1 person) or individual flat pitch with electricity and water terminal (€30 for 1 campervan, 1 person). What more can be said. I recommend for visiting Lisbon."
6411,182539,2,travler2k17,22/08/2017,"Location and swimming pool is great, but the sanitary facilities are dirty and don't work."
6411,180783,3,BD,20/08/2017,"At the end of the season, beautiful location among the pines. Zone At height (far from the kennel and far from the road which we can still hear). We stayed 3 nights (10% discount with the Portugal Camping Book Card). Book refunded with two campsites taken. Welcome ok. Sanitary facilities ok but unfortunately not in number even at this time (plan to take the shower very early or very late). Departure possible at any time. We opted for this campsite for its practicality to visit Lisbon (bus 714 in 20 minutes to Belem in front of the Pasteis factory. Then tram 15 to finish going to town). But with the 714 in its entirety it is playable, meanwhile, we study the backpacker"
6411,179851,5,chvernay,19/08/2017,"3rd visit to this campsite and nothing to complain about. Water, electricity and table and bench at almost every location. Lisbon within reach of Uber for less than 10 euros. Calm and tranquility assured for the night."
6411,179351,4,bouboupoupoule,19/08/2017,"Personally, I found this campsite very quiet. I was on location E10, if you book I recommend it, no close neighbors and enormous space. The swimming pool is also perfect. The only downside is the reception, which doesn't exude fulfillment :-). Since we have everything on site, I have not tested the campsite sanitary facilities. Bus 714 is useful to go to Belem but it is always packed at this time and it is unmanageable. I advise you if you want to go to the center and wherever you want to take number 750 just in front of the campsite and stop to take the metro. It's much less tiring since the bus is empty and above all also fast because it puts you where you want while the 714 imposes its line on you. It's up to you to study this proposal. Otherwise a great campsite for visiting Lisbon."
6411,178323,2,johannawashere,17/08/2017,"Municipal campsite ***, relatively clean, €51/night for 4 people, swimming pool access until 7 p.m. We took bus 714 on the bank in front of the campsite €1.85 per ticket for 45 minutes to the city center where we took the yellow bus €16/person (which pays for all journeys 24 hours including the return bus at the camping). Noisy location, reception in French, supplement €5.5 for check out after 4 p.m. (08/15)"
6411,177000,3,mireee,16/08/2017,"It's pretty good with the toilet, showers, washing dishes, etc. Washing clothes by hand. You also had a mini supermarket next to some washing machines and dryers. That square also had a small bar/restaurant. Each one had a plot with a trash can and one of these country tables. Then during the day you could take the bus, the stop was about 2 minutes from the entrance to the campsite."
6411,176611,4,marypopiet,16/08/2017,"We spent 2 nights there for €79.50 for three people, location in quiet zone I. This is certainly not the most economical solution, but it is the safest. The swimming pool is very nice after a day of sightseeing. Line 714 is very convenient for visiting Lisbon. I recommend."
6411,175186,4,quartz65,15/08/2017,"What can I say, we arrived in the afternoon. Welcome to a large but friendly campsite with advice, beautiful pitches in the shade. Correct sanitary facilities. €28/day for 2 with our traffic and electricity. It's Lisbon so nothing to complain about. Access by bus to the center of the capital seems simple. Recommended because otherwise it is surely difficult to find secure places to leave your vehicle during outings in Lisbon. We tried a service area... Direct U-turn on arrival because it sucked"
6411,173408,1,bomb566,13/08/2017,"I didn't like it at all, everyone had to find the space they could, as if it were in the field... everything uneven. Better to stay in a parking lot"
6411,172377,4,lesbigorgne,12/08/2017,"Pretty good. Very spacious pitch, 80 m2 ours, adequately shaded. Big pool. Sanitary facilities in good condition and generally clean. Price €154 for 3 nights and 4 people, with water and electricity. Bus to town around the corner but easy and quicker by van. We confirm the noise from the highway not far away... ;(). We recommend."
6411,172047,2,correkaminos,11/08/2017,"Spacious, if it doesn't touch you on the left side as you enter it is quiet, because in that area it is noisy due to the highway that passes nearby. €36/night pitch for motorhome and €1.85 bus ticket that picks you up at the door to visit Lisbon. The bus thing deserves special mention. One hour from the campsite to the center of Lisbon. On the way back, we waited for an hour at the stop because it didn't arrive, so many people accumulated that later we walked like canned sardines to the campsite, a shame. Upon arrival, people even applauded. In short, they don't catch me here anymore."
6411,170639,3,daniellepoulat,10/08/2017,"Despite the many derogatory comments, let's not forget that it is an excellent place to visit Lisbon. We tried parking in town but it was impossible. Your vehicle is safe and allows you to take your time. And for dog owners, a dog hotel is located next to the campsite. We tested €12.50 per day, a great welcome."
6411,169627,2,quentin57,09/08/2017,Decent campsite but expensive for the service. Reception not very friendly either. The cleanliness of the sanitary facilities is limited (no daily cleaning visibly). Access to Lisbon via bus 714 for 1.85 euros per trip. Perhaps prefer parking in the city center
6411,166364,2,tom35,05/08/2017,"Access to the historic center of Lisbon via line 714 (around 35/40 minutes) the campsite is large, the swimming pool is noisy (Holiday Club style music) placement is free, prefer a remote location. Certain sanitary facilities must have inspired the creators of films with serial killers (SAW). For a hot shower check before putting on your outfit. Otherwise welcome in French."
6411,166163,3,DOKD,05/08/2017,"Well located campsite, very well secured, practical and well organized. Being objective, the price remains quite high (35/night) for the level of service, sanitary facilities not great at all, and quite a bit of noise from the highway next door. I wouldn't spend my entire vacation there. But great for enjoying Lisbon (we have a motorbike to get around)."
6411,165827,4,roadtripvan,05/08/2017,"Very nice, very pleasant campsite. All employees speak several languages, very appreciated. Possibility of parking anywhere in the park. Water, electricity, draining, however washing machines are extra. Very clean sanitary facilities are large. A little expensive but lots of services: swimming pool, mini market, mini golf, football field, tennis court."
6411,165572,2,veswyta,04/08/2017,It is close at hand to visit the city but there is a lot of noise from the highways that surround it and the store is overpriced.
6411,165170,3,LesGalos,04/08/2017,Large campsite with the possibility of taking a camper van pitch or a free pitch (10 euros less per night). Shadow. Pleasant swimming pool.
6411,163517,5,nougatland,02/08/2017,"We hesitated to go there after reading some of the comments, but in the end this campsite is completely correct in every way. We spent 3 days there in July and for visiting Lisbon, it was perfect. Reception in French possible. A word of advice: park at a height to avoid traffic noise."
6411,162628,4,palmera,01/08/2017,Rather pleasant and well shaded campsite. the toilets are a little outdated but we have had worse! the children loved the large swimming pool and its diving board as well as the paddling pool after the very hot day's visits. certainly it is far from the places to visit but Lisbon is a capital.
6411,161116,4,vany72,30/07/2017,"Very clean campsite with excellent concrete pitches, sanitary facilities ok, perfect for 2 nights and a visit to Lisbon, beautiful swimming pool, however one downside is that we are next to the 4 lanes and we can hear it."
6411,160482,4,natni,29/07/2017,"We were in a quiet location, convenient for visiting Lisbon with bus 714. In the evening happy to take a swim in the swimming pool. Average sanitary facilities. Table and water points on each pitch. Try to be placed as far away from the road/noise as possible. This was our case so correct"
6411,157688,3,steve.perre,24/07/2017,"Campsite well located for visiting Lisboa, indeed the cleaning of some sanitary facilities is poor and the price a little expensive, the campervan location is very correct, avoid zone J and ask for zone I or E (quieter)"
6411,155707,4,chrismarie45,21/07/2017,"I hesitated before coming to this campsite given all the negative comments. I have a hard time understanding all these negative comments. The only negative point is the smell of the urinals in the men's toilets. Otherwise everything else is very good. Pitch 100 square meters including a cemented part, water, electricity, waste water evacuation, sink, trash can as well as a table and bench for each pitch!! OK it's expensive 44 euros per pitch for 3 adults but we are in the capital of Portugal!! So for the unhappy people left at home!!"
6411,153727,2,Mher05,18/07/2017,"€35 for two people and a van for a single night, excessive. In the morning there was no hot water. Since there is nothing else we will have to settle"

A camper factory, poorly maintained or even dirty, mixed reception, green spaces without maintenance, showers opposite the urinals therefore nauseating odors. Bus 300 meters away (Number 714): allow 1 hour from the campsite to reach the center of Lisbon. Don't forget to take a map of the city and buses from the campsite reception! Best locations for quiet: zone I (i). At €35 per night for a campervan and 2 adults, it's a shame due to the monopoly. Enjoy your visit to Lisbon!"
6411,146151,3,chris45,27/06/2017,"Everything has been said about travel times to the center and prices. Let's still highlight the spacious locations with water point, benches and table at each place. Zone J, avoid, extremely noisy, so if possible arrive before noon."

When we passed, the grass was one meter high. In the men's showers, very unpleasant smell of sewer. Beautiful swimming pool with very helpful lifeguard. Avoid roadside locations. To go into town, the taxi costs €15"

6411,141789,3,marinett49,09/06/2017,"Has the merit of existing, too expensive but it's the capital! Correct sanitary facilities, motorhome emptying far away but almost new installation. The swimming pool is just great, a little early in the season. The negative: 1 hour by bus to reach Lisbon, the incessant noise of the motorway too close and too much shade under the large trees"
6411,141451,2,plasmat,07/06/2017,"Passing through at the beginning of May 2017, industrial campsite but unfortunately obligatory to visit Lisbon or Sintra. For Sintra, take bus 740 in front of the campsite to Benfica station and there take the train to Sintra! Several buses and trains per hour!"

6411,139016,2,marinier59,29/05/2017,"Same comment as for Évora campsite in a monopoly situation so usurious prices is a deplorable state of maintenance. This campsite created for the 1998 Universal Exhibition was a model of its kind, unfortunately since no maintenance and even less renovation. Last year, and yes I was already there, there were only staff who were angry, this year it's downright unpleasant with a guard at the entrance who yells at you if you don't go through the metro-type anti-fraud gantry. Lift the stainless steel water drainage trays (one per location) and you will see the cockroach colonies. Regarding the city there are many things to see but you have to take the trouble...."
6411,138273,2,Toucanos,27/05/2017,"This campsite has enormous potential but like many other comments? I will only give 2 stars: the positive: it is huge and at first glance well calculated for motorhomes (each pitch is concreted and has a water supply and an electric terminal) we say that given the price, it 'is normal. But once the half-day is over we move on to the negative: the prohibitive price for the following services: deplorable reception, significant noise from the parallel roads, toilets at the back (where I was placed) abandoned; The services are at the bottom and mostly blocked considering the crowd. What more can we say, we are disappointed. As for the city, I admit that apart from a huge number of museums (I haven't visited any to talk about it) it has nothing extraordinary and given the one and only campsite it does not deserve the detour, it is better Porto. Transport: bus: €1.85 per person to go 1 hour: for those who can afford: the taxi takes 1/4 hour and; it costs around €8... In short, you're never happy!"
6411,136072,1,yvonrcc,20/05/2017,"Too expensive for the services. Very cold welcome, you have the impression of being a nuisance. For the shower you will have to choose between the towel or the briefs, a single hook or a nail to prevent them from bathing in stagnant water. Draining the camper is no better. Be careful of slipping in the drain water. The wifi is very insufficient. In short, go your way"

Very good motor home disposal point too. €7.60 to use a washing machine then tumble drier ; 1 hour at each but dry fresh clothes now ! Local mall and hypermarket but not cyclable; can walk but over busy roads. Good buses into city. Nice coffee. Good free wifi"
6411,112162,4,farani34,29/10/2016,"Affirmative for what is written below. It's expensive, but it's the peace of mind solution for visiting this beautiful capital because the outdoor car parks are sometimes visited by marauders!! The shuttles take us all near the campsite, it's very practical and reassuring!"
6411,110834,5,nicole340,21/10/2016,"Good plan for visiting Lisbon with the 714 bus and for Sintra the 750, we had an excellent welcome with explanations in French, and even a free day, there are 171 concrete platforms with water, electricity and wooden table with bench, individual trash can,"
6411,108408,3,Caymi,01/10/2016,"Only campsite in Lisbon. Large pitches, but expensive €30 (vehicle + 2 adults with electricity). Easy to get to the historic center (1 hour by bus No. 714 near the campsite). The only downside is the sanitary facilities which are not very judiciously arranged (showers with toilets and nauseating odors)."
6411,107826,4,jmd06,28/09/2016,"No competition on the horizon so high price (26 euros per night for 2 at the end of September) and frosty welcome. Correct concrete location with water, electricity, trash can, wooden table on each plot. Bar, cafeteria and food area open until 10 p.m. Hot showers but broken jets. Showers opposite the urinals... Questionable hygiene question... Too bad"
6411,106608,2,Gauthier73,22/09/2016,"Arriving at 6 p.m., we thought we would sleep as close as possible to the center so that we could go there the next morning. Little surprise after paying! Departure before 12 p.m. the next day otherwise second night to be paid. At €22 Hmm. It's not worth it. Try to find parking even a little far away. Too expensive, too noisy. Sanitary correct."
6411,106553,4,kiki49,21/09/2016,"But apart from the sanitary facilities (need to be renovated) for 30 euros private location (water, electricity, table on flat hard floor & swimming pool). Only correct place to have spent 3 nights there to visit Lisbon 1 hour away by bus no. 714. For our part, completely correct for a Capital."
6411,106048,3,sam0907,18/09/2016,"Decent campsite. To visit Lisbon, we took the taxi. Average €20 return for 4 people. Two negative points: only 1 emptying point and only 3 washing machines, quite outdated. But it is okay. Calm"
6411,105550,2,punpun,16/09/2016,"It is the only campsite in Lisbon classified 4 stars! The campsite needs to be seriously refreshed. The service offered is very limited. The surroundings (outside the campsite) are dirty and poorly maintained. The reception does not offer the transport card for all public transport at €6, which is a shame. On the other hand, it is a good plan for visiting Lisbon by motorhome. Bus 714 leaves the campsite and drops you off 40 minutes later at Place Figueras in the center of the city. You can also go down before to visit the Belem Tower."
6411,104519,4,dens26,11/09/2016,"We went there in September 2016. For our part, we were very satisfied. Very warm welcome, French spoken fluently and all explanations given kindly. We were on a camper van pitch with concrete slab, water, electricity, toilet drain on site, wooden table that can be moved, large space. We paid €30 per day for 2 adults, which corresponds to the prices observed during our various trips for an equivalent campsite in an equivalent geographical location. The showers were clean, with hot water and pressure (both morning and evening). Ideal base camp for Lisbon and surrounding areas. Numerous travel mode options. Personally we use our scooter and have had no problems"
6411,104261,3,lydiaZgz,10/09/2016,"Normal camping with little care. The attention of some of the receptionists was quite bad. Good for children because it has a swimming pool, a park... old bathrooms. It's not very clean. good to see Lisbon"
6411,100222,4,nico34,26/08/2016,Perfect for visiting Lisbon. The campsite is large but we can find fairly quiet pitches even in August. Taxi to Lisbon from the campsite for less than €10.

6411,99054,3,javrive,23/08/2016,Perfect campsite to visit Lisbon. It's expensive and the bathrooms are a bit old. The pool is great and has lots of shade. It is more advisable to take a taxi that costs €10 to the city center rather than waiting for the bus.
6411,97496,2,tonyrund,20/08/2016,"Shaded location of course but on a slope. We only had hot water around 2 p.m., in the evening the children were screaming in the showers that the water was frozen. We waited the next morning and saw the same thing. At the same time with solar panels it cannot work 24 hours a day, especially when the weather is not good. Get ready for this wake-up call. Convenient for visiting the city center but be careful the bus stop is not in front of the campsite, where all the people wait, but 300 meters away (prefer a taxi if you are not patient....). In the end €27 for 2 with a transporter, it's really not cheap for cold water and a sloping place. (Motorhomes have dedicated “spaces” with all the comforts but be careful the price must go with it)"
6411,97486,4,pdolivet,19/08/2016,"Whatever the comments, this is definitely the best place to visit Lisbon! Indeed, the sanitary facilities could be better considering the price but still nice locations (high holds required). For 5 people, this reaches €50 per night... I confirm the correct taxi formula to get to Lisbon: count between €10 and €13 per trip."
6411,97253,4,ricou81,19/08/2016,"The campsite is not bad, friendly welcome, clean sanitary facilities, now we will see about the prices. It is sure the price is high €34.98 per day otherwise the pitches are good with water, electricity and trash can at each place and concreted in addition"

In short, an organized mess, not clean, shower door that doesn't close, cold water for showers and all that for a very high price, 2 adults and 2 children in a camper van €37.70. Let's not talk about the laundry, 3 machines for the size of the campsite. I would call this pathetic for a city like Lisbon"
6411,96653,3,MORILLON,18/08/2016,"Large campsite, large pitches. Toilets not very clean on the men's side; smell of urine, shower doors do not close.

You can take bus 714 to get to Lisbon with a 1 hour journey. The best is to take a taxi for €12 you are in the historic center in 2 minutes."
6411,95996,1,rouby1,17/08/2016,"What can I say about this campsite. Reading the other comments, there is everything and nothing. For our part, certainly our worst camping adventure. The toilets are disgusting, the showers and toilets do not lock even for women, no service worthy of the name. All this for more than €50 for 2 people for 2 nights in a combi. Certainly motorhome platforms are pretty. But apparently no space available so free placement with tents and holds. Does not deserve 4* and especially Lisbon does not deserve that, we call it a monopoly."
6411,95378,4,sebontheroad,15/08/2016,"Top campsite, swimming pool with paddling pool, pitches are on a slab with water and electricity. On the pitch, there is also a very practical wooden table. sanitary facilities: perfectly adequate hot and cold water."

6411,92502,1,Juanito6869,10/08/2016,"Huge and expensive campsite with sloping pitches... the services are impractical (laundry closes at 6 p.m., swimming pool at 7 p.m. etc.), unwelcoming staff and above all not feeling responsible for anything... and finally 27 € per night... to avoid"
6411,90899,5,hugolino76,08/08/2016,"This campsite is a very good compromise. Very large so no risk of it being complete. Service at each location: table, individual trash can, drinking water and possibility of emptying. Very beautiful swimming pool which will delight young and old alike. For a European capital campsite, it's pretty well located, half an hour from the center by easy-to-use bus. I recommend."
6411,90262,3,ninifilou,06/08/2016,"Useful for visiting Lisbon. Dated and not super clean but very useful and nice for a capital. A bit of a journey to take the bus to the city center. The taxi passes in front of the campsite, 10 euros per trip and faster."
6411,89979,3,siluech,06/08/2016,"Decent campsite which allows you to visit Lisbon easily. The swimming pool is large, warm, perfect for children. Concerning cleanliness, it is true that it is average at the end of the day but this is more due to the disrespect (to put it mildly) of the users rather than the campsite."
6411,88866,3,kan2baz,03/08/2016,"The price is high for the service. This is probably linked to the fact that they are the only ones. In addition, the transfer to Lisbon via bus is very long and the frequency and promised crossing times are far from being respected. Please note last departure from the city center around 10 p.m."
6411,87802,4,Lowa,01/08/2016,"Very decent campsite. Warm welcome: we will give you the timetable for the bus which takes you to the heart of Lisbon in 45 minutes, the stop is 300 m away. Shaded pitches, all concreted with a picnic table and a water point. Correct sanitary facilities. Great swimming pool! Supermarket, bar/cafeteria, entertainment (there were 2 concerts during our stay). Just a little expensive (€35 per night in a VW Combi for 2 people)"
6411,87760,3,chaman,01/08/2016,"Campsite with a lot of potential, shame that the price is so high (70 euros 2 adults + one child + 1 camper van), quiet (we spent two nights there from Saturday to Monday), clean swimming pool, shame that you have to pay the deckchairs. The sanitary facilities are indeed dilapidated and, in view of the price paid, deserve a makeover. Ideal, however, for visiting Lisbon (yellow bus perfect for visiting Lisbon and the ticket is valid for 24 hours you get off wherever you want and pick it up whenever you want, the ticket is also valid for elevators and city buses, tram 28 also ) good visit !!"

6411,85204,4,lyb57,25/07/2016,"One star less for the cafeteria and the very brief food. The campsite is very well located for visiting Lisbon (714 & 750). It is very clean and quiet except for the evenings organized at the end of the week. The pitches are large with tables. Very pleasant welcome in French, as is the reservation by email. Price: 3 adults (1 teenager and 2 adults), 1 child, camper van with electricity: €46.50"
6411,84525,1,jmichad,23/07/2016,"The swimming pool is invaded by summer camps outside the campsite. Anyone can access the campsite by purchasing swimming pool tickets for next to nothing. Very average reception and sanitary conditions. For €42/night (2 adults, 2 children), I expected better than that."

6411,82333,1,floabert,17/07/2016,We stayed 2 nights. The last one was horrible. The campsite has authorized a private pool party. Music all night despite the promise that everything would be quiet from midnight. Hundreds of drunk young people outside the campsite. Shameful that the campsite accepted this! Avoid at all costs.
6411,82124,2,jimsab18,16/07/2016,"Camping at the limit of cleanliness, sanitation from another time, the food part, entertainment, bar is more than limited... For this price it is just unthinkable.. Not at all like this magnificent city what is Lisbon."
6411,79267,2,0412,01/07/2016,"Very expensive for what it is. The four stars are far from being justified, the park lacks maintenance. If you walk around the park you realize that it's dirty. They justify the price because it's near Lisbon. disreputable."

6411,75935,3,domymoune,07/06/2016,Private campsite well located but noisy. Use multimodality to optimize travel and fully appreciate the city. Take bus 714 to the Belem super site. It's a break to start the day. Take a pass and then take the Tram to the historic center.
6411,75898,4,ajlb,07/06/2016,"Many of us turned around to find the entrance, large cemented sites with picnic tables for each site, water and electricity. all well maintained. Casual welcome in the evening but warm during the day. 30 euros."

6411,64718,2,gill2592,02/03/2016,Expensive for 1 campervan and one person €15/day on undeveloped land. Could do with some effort on grass areas for motorhomes. Leveling and a handful of gravel would be a plus

6411,54953,4,reliz46,15/09/2015,"We were there from September 12 to 14. Of course, there is a ring road nearby but that really didn't stop us from sleeping. The pitches are a little restricted and some are sloping, but can be compensated with wedges. I found the toilets clean and sufficient in number. Regarding the price, it is certainly a little high but we don't really have any other choice for visiting Lisbon. I would like to point out that we paid 16 euros (all inclusive) for 2 people in a camper van instead of 29 € using the camping checks formula."

More or less what it cost us during the trip). But as the days passed. Things got worse. The plots with garbage, the workers very rude, this did not count for much, anyone has a bad day, but the facilities seemed from the seventies and for me it was very important that there was no circle of the throne (for me it is very important to feel at home). house. In short. The only thing good about it is how close it is to the center and the surroundings."

Mr. Francisco knows how to welcome and gives us to taste an excellent Port Wine, which he produces (and sells, of course). We spent 2 very calm nights, the place is safe and the village of Freixo de Numão is very beautiful. I recommend visiting the museums and the Castle of Numão. The Côa Museum is close by and is also worth a visit."

6546,377150,1,1958alain,19/09/2018,Inadmissible to squat a rest area by motorhome associations. You can not even empty some RVs parked on the drain. That's why motorhomes are a bad name.
6546,373715,3,ijinus,14/09/2018,For information a wine cooperative sells very good quality products near the center of the village.
6546,373711,3,ijinus,14/09/2018,"As in previous years I would have liked to stay 2 to 3 days. Unfortunately the entire area was reserved for a group of motorhome of about thirty members. As a result, we were relegated to the adjacent football field. Very unpleasant solution."
6546,295885,5,julien788,21/07/2018,"Aging area but for 5 € you have water and electricity. When in Francisco we went to his suspicious tasting. We still bought port, oil and honey that we hastened to taste in the evening, in case there was deception on the goods. But, it does not matter, its products are excellent and to be next to Porto, you will not find better at a reasonable price. Go see also the small grocery store next door, it is butcher. 8 € / kg for prime rib, a delight."
6546,285091,2,totoze,10/07/2018,The port that you buy is not of the same quality as the tasting and the olive oil of poor quality the responsible good-looking speaker too kind to be honest attention catches tourists

The parking is the old parking lot of a soccer field and the showers and ec are the changing rooms, a little old and dirty, the water is hot.

The next day we were 6 motorhomes. This friendly area is well known. The place is very relaxing. The emptying area is in very good condition, despite the words ... And even if Francisco is not a winemaker, the port that sells € 15 for 5 liters, is excellent. This is the main. We will iron Francisco."

6546,74033,5,beatricebl,20/05/2016,"Very nice motorhome area, quiet, very welcome. There is a museum which is very interesting to visit. We wanted to see the church but it was closed. We saw a lady who kindly opened the doors. She is very beautiful. It's worth going back to it."

Overall the space is not gleaming however the services allow a satisfactory step. No wifi access, but good TV reception. Every day at 18h an itinerant baker (it horns generously!) Offers 50 meters from the area, various breads, pastries and some pastries. Port producer reported by ""Coulou"": not seen! At 100 meters the modest bar (lunch only) will receive the price of your parking."

6556,3115583,3,millera,10/08/2023,"Magnificent area that says a lot about its city. It hurts that many neighbors use it as private parking. On the road we all greet each other, or almost, but when you arrive at an area..., camaraderie and solidarity ""park"". Health, kilometers and contempt for freeloaders."

Many wide spaces for AC that fill up quickly, people park in the rest of the parking lot without problems. The feeling is that many cars belong to neighbors who park them there. We will repeat!!

Later we will complain when they remove this type of services. people are very pig, they have no regard, we lack education. I have already seen it in more car parks, apart from the dirt, in this car park, specific not to empty pottis and gray water from 7 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Well, people do it the other way around, no one in the afternoon and everyone during the day.

6556,2643474,3,jjara,06/04/2023,"Very noisy area as it is next to a large avenue. In its favor is that being in the center, you can go to the whole city by tram. Worst? The Wednesdays! They put on a market and it is better to leave, the people from the stalls park you in motorhome spaces and the waters are closed until 2:30 p.m. (if you are lucky and they have removed the vans, otherwise you have to wait for them to remove them). It does the trick and is appreciated, but it could improve a lot."

6556,2098942,4,MiquelOliver,20/07/2022,an area very well located and easily accessible.
6556,2096581,5,Joricod,20/07/2022,"Ideal to visit the city, and if you have bicycles much more, since the city is prepared to make the visit by bike. Well maintained filling and emptying services. (Beware that on Wednesday mornings the services are closed due to a market)"
6556,2082628,3,msalvado,16/07/2022,"Positive point: Vitoria has a bike lane, from the area you can go to the center by bike quickly and safely. Negative point: AC squares have no shade. We have been 2 nights (Thursday and Friday) and we have slept peacefully, yes you can hear the circulation of the avenue but it has not bothered us."
6556,2064744,4,casan10,12/07/2022,Good area to visit the city. It is close to the tram and walking to the old town about 30 min. A super close. The sites are fine and the filling and emptying services are very good and well thought out. The activity in the area starts very early and quite a few cars pass by on the avenue that is very close
6556,2058597,5,Ecj007,10/07/2022,"Large parking for cars and campers, on Wednesdays there is a market, if there is no space there is more parking next door, I have spent one night and without problem. The center about 15 'walk."
6556,2052104,4,guimaraes1971,09/07/2022,Thanks to the city for this free space; Merci à la ville pour cet espace gratuit
6556,2051638,3,GuismoteenDana,08/07/2022,"Thanks to the City Council of Vitoria for this area. Very close to the pirate park. If it is very busy, with a lot of traffic and overcrowded. If it is full you can park in the Eroski car parks that are next door."
6556,2039793,4,VespaSigrid,05/07/2022,We stood with our thick ship in the parking lot outside the rows of campers and didn't have a length problem because of the double rows. Everything was clean and quiet at night. The garbage disposal has not explained itself to us. V/E we have wg. Vehicle size not used. Gladly again.
6556,2031709,2,BiMo58,02/07/2022,"The square is centrally located to visit the old town in 3.5 km! However, the Womo parking lot is on two sides of a busy main road. At the moment, a fair is also being set up directly on the adjacent car park. So a quiet night is out of the question."
6556,2030453,5,RaycoCeballos,02/07/2022,Great area near the city a bit noisy but you can sleep well Thanks to the City Council of Vitoria
6556,2028472,3,Manuel.R,01/07/2022,"Correct filling and emptying, good location but it is usually always full without motorhome rotation by people who settle without respecting the maximum hours, supermarkets, bars and basic services very close"
6556,2028305,3,Gordi21,01/07/2022,"The only thing missing is for the town council to put in some self-cleaning public toilets with showers, like the ones in Bermeo."
6556,2008430,4,GermenViajero,25/06/2022,Area very well located to spend the night en route to France. Very close to bars and shops. Beware that on Wednesday mornings there is a market and it is not possible to access the filling and emptying services. Thanks to the city of Vitoria for betting on this type of tourism :)
6556,1995590,3,Ma.Eugenia,20/06/2022,Near a tram stop.
6556,1979331,3,onubense,15/06/2022,"thanks to the city of Vitoria for having this area for those of us who visit the city, which is beautiful and very clean, but it must be said that there are many locals who have this area as their own parking lot, bothering those of us who come through and also saying the behavior from some rude people who come they take tables and chairs between the two motorhomes in your own entrance they are scoundrels"
6556,1978861,4,mariu2021,15/06/2022,"Free camper park, not very big so it might be difficult to find a place. Parking allowed for three days. Great location to visit the historic center by tram, we slept without disturbance. Perfect load unloaded, no current. The only problem if it is very hot is completely under the sun. Market Wednesday morning enters and exits during market hours."
6556,1971162,5,Tartraneta,12/06/2022,"Area with drinking water, discharge of gray and black water and containers. No electricity. Laundry, bakery, supermarket and playground nearby. Tram and urban bus a few minutes walk. The drawback is that if you park near the road there is some noise from 6 or 7 in the morning."
6556,1953575,5,Quenaro,06/06/2022,"A perfect place for a stopover. Clean, secure, close to shops. This is the third time we have stopped there. This time the area is full but we pulled into the parking lot just at the edge of the area. Maybe squatted places all year round? Anyway, a big THANK YOU to the city."
6556,1952879,5,jppp,06/06/2022,Great place in the immediate vicinity of supermarkets and a laundromat. The tram makes it easy to reach the pretty historic center. The tourist office has published a guide which lists places of interest and parking lots for motorhomes. Thanks to the city of Vitoria Gasteiz. The Wednesday market limits access to the car park and service area. It is better to arrive on Tuesday evening and leave on Wednesday afternoon at the earliest.
6556,1947742,5,masterhh,05/06/2022,Well located place in a small beautiful town. Street is quite noisy but still recommended.
6556,1934179,4,LAGADITANA,31/05/2022,"ideal place to spend the night and visit the city, more than half of the motorhomes are permanently parked there, so there are few places."
6556,1919603,5,Kamion,27/05/2022,"Excellent quiet area despite the city location. As for camping car pitches, wide and comfortable places. On-site grocery store and ideal bike paths to visit the old town. Thank you to the municipality for this attention given to us."

6556,1910676,5,Polux64,23/05/2022,What more could you ask for to visit the old town by bike. Quiet despite the proximity of the boulevard. Fine for one night. Nothing to say thank you to the city

6556,1870738,4,Leslobs3,05/05/2022,"Convenient parking lot. Services closed on Wednesday morning due to the market. Attention: this morning, only one water tap for filling and cleaning the cassette... We spent 1 quiet night"
6556,1866923,5,mapicalat,02/05/2022,"Area was full, but you can spend the night in the parking lot. To visit Vitoria ideal, a walk to the historic center and if not by tram that stops 5 minutes away. the spacious squares."
6556,1866839,4,oceeme,02/05/2022,"Quite a large area and well located in illuminated, a short walk from the center. Being next to a large public car park, there are too many people coming and going at all hours, resulting in noise even at 7am. But you can sleep well and feel safe."
6556,1834108,5,sveigasalgado,18/04/2022,"Comfortable and spacious area. When we were there, the places did not arrive, but you can spend the night in the parking lot without any problem. Nearby tram stop, but you can also go to the historic area on foot in 20-25 min. The city is very flat and the streets are wide, with many green areas, so the walk is pleasant. A free area so well located is appreciated."
6556,1814778,4,popajoel,11/04/2022,"Among a few hundred motorhomes in this car park, only a dozen are inhabited. A pure and hard car park of owners who have no choice but to store them elsewhere in this city of 350,000 inhabitants"
6556,1802371,4,loky17,31/03/2022,"Nice location in the city center, a little noisy of course but you get used to it and despite what is said it is possible with a trailer. Thank you to the municipality for this free"

6556,1797909,4,sciroco,27/03/2022,Large area with beautiful pitches on tarmac. The services are closed on Wednesday morning due to the market. A bit far from the city center on foot which we didn't really appreciate. But maybe not for everyone.
6556,1789551,4,Citijo,20/03/2022,"Parking with a few places, because there are motorhomes that are permanently located, well located for visiting the city."
6556,1786976,2,dupi24,18/03/2022,"Our worst night for 3 months that we have been in Spain… the places are not very big, not possible for motorhomes with trailers, except to unhitch or get in with the cars. Otherwise 4g ok"
6556,1785063,3,mjcuenca,16/03/2022,"Most of the spaces are permanently occupied despite the maximum 72h sign, so we had to park outside the limited area (as well as other caravans and campers). The tap for filling drinking water has a large mouth, the normal coupling does not work, so it was impossible for us to fill the tank. Otherwise, quiet night. Next door you have the super and a laundry. 30mins walk from the center."
6556,1784462,3,bkb,15/03/2022,"Free area, practical, near the city center and shops. Free water and emptying services. Bins (no sorting) . Many places are permanently occupied by Spanish motorhomes. Lots of comings and goings during the day. Quiet night."
6556,1782192,3,clomax,13/03/2022,"Very well located, close to shops. Too bad that three quarters of the places are squatted by the CC of Spanish residents. We arrived at 4pm no room"
6556,1776659,4,erstmaldurcheuropa,07/03/2022,"Free mobile home parking space for small to medium-sized campers on the outskirts of Vitoria-Gasteiz. In the immediate vicinity you can buy or do the laundry. It is a 25-minute walk to the historic old town, which is well worth seeing. Many well-kept green spaces are nearby. The supply and disposal is laid out generously and cleanly. Unfortunately, locals occupy the pitches permanently."
6556,1772173,5,PetenBev,03/03/2022,"Super free location to stop and visit the city. Two supermarkets right next door and there is a lavanderia just the other side of the Eroski supermarket. Only downside is that the water fill has a very big connector and, although I have a selection of different connectors, I didn’t have one like this one."

6556,1743749,4,MartaRoman,29/01/2022,"Quiet area. Very busy. Next to supermarkets, restaurants and health center. The only drawback for not having 5 stars is that it does not have a water fill tap, since it was broken. Only grays can be emptied."
6556,1736528,5,Lemarelta,18/01/2022,"thank you, Vitoria-Gasteiz, for that area. With supermarkets nearby, police and laundries. We felt safe and were able to visit this magnificent city."

6556,1719167,4,sandrido,29/12/2021,Stayed 2 nights in this area which is in fact a parking area of the Eroski supermarket dedicated to campers. Free parking and loading and unloading. It is a bit of a walk from the center but there are no other choices in town. Convenient the Tg2 tram to get to the center. Vitoria is a very lively and interesting city.
6556,1712651,4,hikingcouple,19/12/2021,"We have been two nights, a very good area with all free services, close to shops and super like Eroski right next door and Mercadona in front, well connected to the center, the tram passes very close."

Thanks to the city council of Vitoria for this free area with gray and black filling and emptying services, which allows you to see such a beautiful city and enjoy its gastronomy."
6556,1657432,4,marpaufel,22/10/2021,"Very good area. Many thanks. Luckily, here they understand that this type of tourism is also necessary. We must take care of areas like these and set an example of good motorhomes."

6556,1650025,3,felibea,17/10/2021,"A great area, services are always available, today it was full, most of the spaces are occupied by people from the area who use them as private parking. It hurts that the city council does not take action on the matter and begins to fine (it says that it is for 72 hours)"

In our case we have not had problems with noise and everything is fine despite being next to one of the main avenues. Recommendable.

6556,1632158,5,caletiman,07/10/2021,"There is a lot of exclusive space for AC and there is also room for vans. It is true that the van is shared with cars, but the parking lot is huge and the ""conventional"" parking area and the sleeping area are perfectly respected. Next to the center and with services nearby."

6556,1627425,4,martareist,05/10/2021,"Typical parking lot for a city. It was very busy. You can stand for 72 hours. It is advisable not to come in the evening, as you may then have to park outside the parking lot, where the parking lot is intended for cars."
6556,1616816,4,happyflo,29/09/2021,"Quiet area, free emptying and filling of water services, away from the historic center, but with Tram services nearby, when we got up on Wednesday they had already set up the market behind the motorhomes."

I spent 2 nights, the first in a square in AC near the Portal de Foronda race and very noisy after 6 in the morning. The second night I changed to the more inland parking area and I was not bothered by the noises. It has all the services and free and close to the Arriaga park, large and very beautiful."

6556,1553182,5,GarciaFamily,06/09/2021,"Quiet to spend the night, we have not heard the noise of the traffic as they say, although somewhat far from the center. Wide, no matter the size of your motorhome, and with the basic services of filling and emptying of water. 100% recommendable."
6556,1541859,5,vivirnoescaro,02/09/2021,"Great area. We slept here for two great nights, except on Tuesday, when to escape the market the next day, we went to a parking lot under the Corte Inglés where you can also sleep great and is closer to the center."
6556,1541724,5,Mollychausson,02/09/2021,Excellent. Tram stop just down road. Lovely interesting city. Grey and black water emptying (except Wednesday morning). Big Mercadona supermarket just across the road. And it’s free. Thank you Vitoria- Gasteiz.

6556,1535449,4,ManjiRonin,31/08/2021,"We arrived on a Wednesday, market day. An authentic odyssey to find how to access the motorhome area, otherwise more than correct and clean facilities to be an AC area of the city."

6556,1517641,5,jsaiza,27/08/2021,"Very nice area. With all the emptying and filling services, plenty of room and quiet (we have not noticed the noise of the cars). It is far from the center to walk, but the tram is next door."
6556,1514296,4,Altair,26/08/2021,"Good motorhome area with tram stop nearby (Foronda Kalea stop). A trip 1.5 euros. If you get off at the Parliament stop you are in the center, the area is NOT a 15 m walk from the center, there are many more (the tram takes that long)."

6556,1503911,5,Moralva,23/08/2021,"Extraordinary, Free with no time limit. It has no services, but it is comfortable, clean and quiet. Next to a mercadona and the ertzaina. To the center walking 15 minutes and by bus even less."
6556,1500982,5,Vanmcluis,23/08/2021,"We were in July 2021 to visit this beautiful city, despite being large there was only one free place, those who arrived after us positioned themselves in the part of the large parking lot not reserved for campers, it's free, clean, the only limitation day of market, I think Thursday, the CS is closed, and you cannot stop in the non-reserved part, tram to the center and nearby supermarket"
6556,1499889,4,kimete,22/08/2021,"This week on Friday night I counted 64 motorhomes, well located, noisy, but quiet. l'erzaina passes through the area, and without problems. Let's be civil and be patient when you go to the dump site. there are people who are better at it than others, patience, thank you."
6556,1499141,5,centrodelsur,22/08/2021,"Good area, although it is small on special dates they are permissive and you can park in the same parking lot even if the square is not specific for ACs. Vitoria is a luxury city, beautiful, walkable, clean and with some very good places to go for pintxos. Thank you for hosting us."
6556,1496403,5,Monderland,22/08/2021,"I am amazed at the negative comments. I am from Vitoria and I have not found a free area with more places or a cleaner service area. It has the same ""tower"" with two taps, perhaps people have not seen the second (although it surprises me). It is next to the exit road from Vitoria so if a car passes I suppose it will be heard, but there is usually no traffic at night. Very large park nearby."

We are a lot and for COVID issue we are all crowded where we go I think that if we all put a little bit of our part we could all park !! The companionship that was on the road is being lost! We have been from Area to Area all day and not a single site! Kilometers per euskadi !! There I leave it !!

6556,1084705,1,jaimegpuente,07/10/2020,"Good service area, noisy and far from the center, everything acceptable, what I do not see logical is that for a market of four clothing stalls they deliberately block access to services during one morning, it is not that the market occupies that part of the area is that with a truck they block the entrance."

On Wednesdays they do market right next to the car park, keep this in mind because you cannot drain water that day from 7:00 to 14:30. 30 'walk from the center or much less by tram. If we go back to Vitoria, we will go back there."
6556,1047532,3,mikyII,14/09/2020,"Good area but with the disadvantage of the great smell that the area gives off due to the unloading area used on Sunday afternoons mostly by all the motorhomes in the surroundings to pour their black and gray. I have counted up to 10 vehicles waiting. The water tap used for cleaning poti at the same time as filling with water. In any case, thanks to the city council of Vitoria, if there were more like this we would be more distributed"

6556,788110,5,alain_spam,28/02/2020,Impeccable. if there is no more space we still have a huge parking lot to park. rather very quiet for such a large parking lot in the city. very airy town with cycle paths everywhere. swimming pool nearby. on the other hand in full sun in full summer it must be the furnace ....
6556,788049,4,padraigl,28/02/2020,"This Aire has 40 dedicated parking spaces for motorhomes located at the end of a very large carpark close to the main road. 
The spaces are fairly level (we needed to raise the back slightly) and are not suitable for extra large motorhomes or motorhomes with trailers. There were some large lorries parked in the normal carpark while we were there. The maximum stay is 72 hours.
The Aire was busy all the time we were there with only a few spaces empty. Some motorhomes arriving late at night parked in the normal carpark spaces.

For first time visitors to the Aire, do not take a left at the roundabout when you see motorhomes on your left. Drive down past Mercadona and at the next junction do a u-turn and take a right into the carpark.

**NOTE: The service bay is closed on Wednesdays from 7am to 2.30pm due to the local market.

Pros:
Free parking.
Free full services excluding electricity.
Local supermarkets, restaurants, cafes and bars. 
Some shade.
Walking and bike paths.

Cons:
Road noise.
Only 1 tap.

There are full free services excluding electricity. The area is behind a fence and gate which is locked on market day. There is only one tap for fresh water and to clean the cassette.

The grey drain has great flow direction into the center grate. 

The black WC drain is 250mm off the ground under a large steel cover. The drain pipe is very large with no splashback. There is no dedicated cassette tap. You have to use the fresh water tap. It has a 3/4 turn handle so pressure can be regulated.

The fresh water tap is a medium screw-on connection with excellent pressure. The tap has a 3/4 turn handle to regulate the flow.

There are large bins beside the services.

It's 35 minutes walk to the city center. Just follow the tram line. The tram station is down the road from the Aire.
Mercadona is across the road and Alcampo and BM supermarkets are 10 minutes walk further on.
Al Boulevard shopping center is 15 minutes walk away. There is a very good Leroy Merlin there for any van needs.

We had 3 very quiet nights here even though there is traffic noise but we slept well.

Bugs/Mosquitoes. (They love us..)
We did not encounter any mosquitoes here in the end of February."

6556,786554,4,Avalonwolf,25/02/2020,"So far there is nothing to add to the parking space, disposal good, no electricity, free of charge. About 45 minutes on foot to the old town, but there is also a bus directly from the parking space. The place was a little restless on the weekend due to constant coming and going, but it was also a carnival and a local derby."
6556,784102,5,YAYAFRANKY,21/02/2020,"We arrived in the morning and there were already 20 cars parked, the squares are very wide, right next to it there is a Mercadona and some bars. In the afternoon it has filled up a lot but there is another parking lot next to it where there are also parked motorhomes. It has filling and emptying service."
6556,777353,3,bernd12,07/02/2020,The route guidance led me past the place. Tomorrow new start for disposal.
6556,777108,5,Antaress,07/02/2020,"Very large spaces. We arrived at night, and there were at least 20. Be careful on Wednesdays, that there is a street market. If it is full, right next to it there is another parking lot where there were several cars. The center catches almost 4 kilometers, so it is convenient to take a tram (direction Angoulême, and get off in Parliament)"
6556,776452,4,jacknight,05/02/2020,"Yes, I confirm the comments. It takes 2.5 km to 3 km to get to the historic center. Reminder: no emptying possible on Wednesday morning. And thank you to the person who gives the directions for the tram."

6556,774952,3,Jonypere,01/02/2020,"Free area with large squares, although these are occupied, but you can also park in other places. There is a tram next door that leaves you in the center in 10 minutes. Something noisy being next to a large avenue."
6556,774751,3,Barcobird,01/02/2020,"Changed since we were last here from caged area holding 12 motorhome to expanded area holding about 50 and there is ample parking on other areas of a vast car park. Good stop off point with services easy access, well lit and safe. Although near main roads surprisingly quiet at night. Town centre about 2 kilometres but well worth the walk. Bars restaurants and supermarkets very close by."
6556,772007,3,eleal,24/01/2020,"Well, it is a parking lot with services. Enough traffic and just a tap."
6556,771371,4,lolo45,22/01/2020,"Plenty of spaces, parking along a busy day road. We did not sleep there. Free services, no electricity. Perfect for a day stopover. Attention, market on Wednesday morning."
6556,766099,4,txilibistro,08/01/2020,"Well to spend some night, we spend the weekend d Reyes. Still do not put the second tap of water ... hopefully someone picks up this keja. Otherwise very very well."
6556,766077,4,acrux,08/01/2020,"We slept in this area the night from Tuesday to Wednesday. It is true that there is some noise, being in the city itself, and in the morning when they start to assemble the market, but it is totally recommended. At about 200 meters there is a tram stop that takes you to the center in 10 minutes, with trains every 15. As for the city, one of our favorite indoor."
6556,764837,5,voirpy,05/01/2020,Very convenient
6556,763768,4,padalu69,04/01/2020,I wish all cities had an area like this!

6556,753508,4,Biojm2,14/12/2019,"Excellent location near the city center and buses. Very well designed services. Plenty of room and in full sun, to be considered as flat. The noise is that of a city so no surprise."

6556,751836,3,footy,09/12/2019,"Very large motorhome areas, two aisles are reserved only for the motorhome, the rest of the parking lot is mixed, on Wednesdays, the mixed parking lot is reserved for the market while it is closed. Like any downtown car park given the traffic, it's noisy"
6556,749863,4,mleniaert,04/12/2019,"Quiet, clean and relatively quiet place for a city center. To recommend."
6556,749690,5,sunlita,03/12/2019,Very large area ... tram opposite.
6556,737312,3,SunRoller,03/11/2019,"Very large space with room for many motorhomes. The drawback that I have observed as in so many other areas is that there is only one tap to fill and rinse the toilet. From what we have seen, we did not use the terminal."
6556,736919,4,sergicondal,03/11/2019,"Very good. ..we were the night of October 29, great ... a little traffic but not as much as they say ... in 15 min walk you are in the Center ..."

6556,732897,4,Neneriz,29/10/2019,"It's very good. The squares are large and easy access, the bad thing is the traffic throughout the night of the next avenue"
6556,729579,5,Ele_y_jose,25/10/2019,"Everything is great. Just keep in mind the Wednesday restriction. Something loud, but little."
6556,728257,4,Tebi_design,23/10/2019,"Perfect place to stay to know the city. Quite flat, free and with a place to download water and fill. If you come Tuesday to Wednesday as is our case, keep in mind that there is a market on Wednesday morning (as a positive point you have to buy it breakfast). As a negative point to say something maybe that is a bit noisy. Otherwise great"
6556,725698,2,mariviytxus,20/10/2019,"A very nice area, but we have observed that there are more than 5 motorhomes parked for a long time, they use it as parking. A pity they do not take control of these things."
6556,720552,4,alaitzo,13/10/2019,"Greetings to those who put the mouth of the potty inside the tap to fill water, rubbing well your fecal bacteria where others (you do not?) Hooked the hose. What should be two taps? Yes. What do those who come behind sweat? Too."

6556,702980,4,Vandiamo,24/09/2019,Excellent facilities in beautiful central Vitoria. We weren’t there when market was on (Wednesdays) when you can’t use servicing facilities between 7-14.30. Dedicated bays too short for our 9m Moho but there must have been another 16 vans parked throughout the car park so it didn’t seem to be a problem. €1.45 one way on tram to centre (direction Angulema) return to Portal de Foronda (direction Abetxuco) care as there are 2 trans going in different directions on return

6556,692122,3,cocardis,15/09/2019,"Urban area so noisy, one tap for cassettes and filling of clean water. Fun to see people rinse their cassette and then connect their hose to the same tap, hello bacteria and others ..."
6556,688542,5,carlosblay,13/09/2019,"Good area.Very large (if the specific part for motorhomes is complete there is no problem with using any other place in the very large parking lot), free, clean, level, some shade, well connected to the historic center. Only that which has already been commented on that there should be a separate tap for clean water can only be improved. Our thanks to the City Council of Vitoria."
6556,685846,4,condejm,11/09/2019,"Urban area, well to visit the city. We had to park outside because it was full but without problem, there is plenty of parking."
6556,674288,4,mobilvetta40,03/09/2019,"Good area with many spacious squares. Good communication in the center; bike lane and tram. Next to Mercadona. The bad thing that only has a mouth of water. I do not find it too loud, it is a city area. Wednesday it is prohibited to use the unloading area in the mornings for a market."
6556,672703,4,pedrolb76,01/09/2019,Large area a few minutes by bike to the city center. You hear the vehicles that pass in your vicinity but it is not very annoying. We have spent about 70 BC and Camper and without problem.
6556,666126,3,mucatoche,29/08/2019,We have spent the night without noise problem. Spacious and quite clean. 5 minutes from downtown with the tram.
6556,662791,3,aparca_mcg,27/08/2019,"The area is fine. A lot of room, but the fact of having a single tap to clean the drum (it is easy to touch the tap) is completely discarded to get clean water there. On Wednesday it is forbidden to empty the market that shares a site with the stalls."
6556,658598,4,Javicamo,25/08/2019,"Very good place to stop, spend the night and continue the route or visit this beautiful city. There is only one tap and that must be improved to avoid infections. Thanks City Hall."
6556,657395,4,javerago,25/08/2019,Wide and well connected caravan area. 25 minutes walk from the cathedral. A Mercadona in front. Wednesday shares space with a street market.

6556,622257,4,wuisin,12/08/2019,"Very large and wide area, it is on the outskirts of Vitoria. We arrive at the center of Vitoria by bike, there is a bike path that passes by the parking lot."
6556,620293,5,mercigd,12/08/2019,"We visited Vitoria taking the tram in one of the parallel streets. Very large parking. The car area was full, but we stayed overnight in the car area without problems. Mercadona in front."

6556,613991,3,France7531,09/08/2019,"We came in March 2019. It was good. In August, the proximity of the public parking and the city makes this camping area too noisy in the evening."
6556,611298,5,jfiestasl,09/08/2019,"The area is large and the entrance is well signposted. Keep in mind that on Wednesdays there is a market right next door and the police close the entrance to the area from 7 in the morning until 2 in the afternoon, including the emptying and filling area, although it is allowed to leave the area Well, the exit is open."
6556,610515,4,capmatt43,08/08/2019,"Perfect for a night, quiet although in town, free services, tram 5 minutes walk to reach the city center in 10 minutes"
6556,600277,4,pupi,05/08/2019,"Great area to spend the night and visit Vitoria. Although all the squares were occupied, we parked in the parking lot adjacent to the area, where many AC and camper were also parked. The tram stop is very close and leaves you in the city center in less than 10 minutes. Eye! The last tram back on Saturdays is at 23:00. Many thanks to the Ayto de Vitoria for this initiative."

6556,577941,5,RaulEspinosa,26/07/2019,Large and numerous spaces although the area is full. All services except electricity. Tram to the nearby center (1'45 e per person) very quiet to rest and that was a holiday in the city (blouse day). Highly recommended.
6556,577313,5,mariviytxus,26/07/2019,We like. Large plots and in the tram in a plis plas you are in the center.
6556,576602,5,AutoBeni,26/07/2019,Very good area. An example and they could learn other town halls in other cities.
6556,569899,4,GabiMoya,22/07/2019,"The area is wonderful, very spacious and free. The only thing that if you use Google Maps to arrive, the indication that you give when you arrive is wrong, since the last roundabout before arriving says the second exit, and it is the first, and a little later on, make a change of direction, just so you can access the area."
6556,564185,5,NomadStudio,20/07/2019,"Very comfortable, all good"
6556,557605,5,Stromdc,16/07/2019,Perfect place to stop on a route and visit the city. Tram station nearby and you can also walk to the center of a long walk
6556,557177,4,rolneus,16/07/2019,"Perfect free urban ac area. Something noisy but normal, if we think we are inside a city. A quarter of an hour from the historic center on foot and 100 meters from several supermarkets. Thanks to the city council for the free services. These costs end up supporting small business. We try to invest the travel savings in support of the local economy."
6556,556334,4,humanbru,16/07/2019,If it is true that it is noisy but how can my house be hahahaha. There is a lot of space and always with many vehicles nearby. Mercadona directly opposite and the police. Tram very close that gives you in the center to four stops. Highly recommended this site!
6556,551409,4,stayfree11,13/07/2019,Area with little shade. Very complete and recommendable. The center nearby and bike path. All free. Good bet of the city for this type of tourism.

6556,544264,5,EGCASTRO,08/07/2019,"The entrance to the Parking is by ""Portal de Foronda"" Attention to the posters that indicate it well!"
6556,541228,3,Paichi,06/07/2019,"On Saturday at 7 in the morning, 3 buses arrived. People talking without cutting before getting on what I deduce was an excursion. Tip: Do not park near the lane that goes to the exit, cars pass at all hours and some with music. Respect 0. If you park where the gardens are quieter, the sprinklers activate at dawn, they irrigate you !. No shade, if it's summer and you do not have a / c cooking"
6556,539988,3,djack44,05/07/2019,Very big place where we never stop to stop during a trip with all the free amenities and a bakery behind the motorhomes and lots of restaurants. Thanks to the city of Vittoria Gastez.

6556,528904,2,claudiaache,26/06/2019,"The area is central and with many motorhomes, which gives you security to sleep. However, on Wednesday at 7 in the morning they set up a market right next door and they can not sleep anymore."
6556,520908,3,chickpea,19/06/2019,We stayed for one night to visit the historic city which is beautiful and not too far to walk from the site. The Aire itself is a huge carpark and absolutely heaving with motorhomes. There are supermarkets close by. Being by the road and housing estates it is very noisy. There are constant queues for the service area and unfortunately only one tap so taking water is impossible unless you are prepared to use the WC tap.
6556,508258,1,coralys,08/06/2019,1 tap alone: crippling for us!
6556,502620,4,manusm,03/06/2019,"Despite being a bit noisy we have gone several times and the experience is very good. It has all the free services, bars, supermarkets and public transport next"
6556,493074,5,GaraziMayordomo,26/05/2019,"We are from Vitoria and we recommend the Area. It has many places besides being next to several parking lots where all year long there are many ACs. Free emptying and filling services. Mercadona, Consum and Day next. Attached to the health center. Bike lane from the area to the center. Tram and bus next to arrive in 7 min. Walking 30 minutes in a straight line along Avenida Gasteiz, nice walk."
6556,487867,5,cmlaura,19/05/2019,"Very large motorhome area, to empty and replenish free water. With the tram at 5 minutes that leaves you in the center. We have slept very quietly."

6556,469417,5,Misirika,27/04/2019,When we arrived the area for campers was complete. Even so we spend the night in the adjoining parking lot without problems.
6556,465658,3,mdeb,23/04/2019,Unfortunately only 1 tap!
6556,464299,5,gudaridelamor,22/04/2019,"Although the address is like Luis Olariaga street, which is next to the area enabled for the autocaracanas, you really enter through Portal de Foronda street. It is signposted after passing the last building and starting the parking area."
6556,463374,5,elo47,22/04/2019,Stop for a quiet night for a city. there are all the services. Shops nearby

6556,458881,3,javeasteve5,19/04/2019,"Spent the night here with 40 plus other Motorhomes. Regular Police patrols, well lit and reasonably quiet although it was raining. Only one tap in services and saw numerous persons enclose tap with toilet cassette, fortunately we had filled up in Pamplona. Bin men at 08.30 although street cleaner was working at 07.30."
6556,455816,3,theroverlanders,15/04/2019,"Stayed here for one night, ideal to explore the city on foot but was very light as per previous comments and the road noise does start early"

6556,449964,4,jerryweidemagmail.com,06/04/2019,Just perfect. Very big parking lot not too far from the nice city center. A lot of other campers as well. I think some people live here permanently! Spent the night without problems. Only downside to us: there is a lot of light from lanterns.
6556,448236,4,lemourrou,02/04/2019,"Thank you to the town hall for this area available to us. A lot of room, it is welcome after a long journey. This encourages me to make purchases in this city."

6556,446758,5,Ledgerca,30/03/2019,"The area is a large car park with services, although there is just the one tap. 
It is a big disappointment to see a few Motorhome owners sitting out in the car park with tables and chairs. I believe this counts as camping behaviour and if it continues could possibly end in the City banning motorhomes. Why do these few individuals try to ruin things for the majority of us."
6556,444410,5,narvals64,25/03/2019,"Area with basic services but very quiet, near tranbia stop to go to the old town, Thanks Vitoria for welcoming us"
6556,442381,3,alain23747,20/03/2019,"Attention, access is at the ""46 Portal de Foronda Kalea"" (N 622 north) and not the address given title. Very correct area although in the city. It is only a car park, but big, quiet, clean and safe with a basic but functional service area without electricity."
6556,442120,4,Ivan74,20/03/2019,"Near the center by tram. Free and all services. The exclusive area of Ac was full but the parking lot is so big that the plots next to the area were also with Ac and there we parked. I do not give 5 stars because there seems to be Ac who had been parked for some time, and that should not be the function of the area. For the rest, thank you Vitoria!"

6556,430552,2,abas,17/02/2019,A very good area with many places but with a problem almost always complete. Due to some people who do not respect the parking time and use the area as a private and indefinite parking. THIS IS A CALL TO WHOM IT CORRESPONDS. OF ALL.
6556,427629,5,GD37,08/02/2019,"Although in town, quiet at night. large enough places, very clean parking. top services. thank you to the city. Historic center very pretty. To visit and walk the streets, stairs, escalators. 30 to 40 minutes on foot. otherwise tram. Bakery and supermarket nearby"

6556,418886,5,sebasti,01/01/2019,"Perfect! Spacious places and a lot of room. We stayed on New Years Eve and no problem. My opinion is that it is not as loud as it is said. There is a large road right next to it, but there is a normal noise, considering it is an urban AC area."
6556,417430,3,LaPeque,29/12/2018,Good parking from where you can visit the city. It has a bike path to the center or you can go to visit all the parks in the city. A basic area but with enough services to be comfortable.

We’ve stayed at tuns of rest areas, parking lots and free campsites but this was probably the worst place we ever stayed at. Yes, there are loads of other campers staying there, but it really is just a big parking lot in the middle of a quite dodgy, urban area. The parking lot is filled with huge lights as if you’re camping in a soccer arena, there are no facilities and when we woke up around 7am, we were surrounded by market stalls (it wasn’t a Wednesday) and we’re told in a rather intimidating manner that we weren’t allowed to be there. There is so much beauty in the surrounding area, find a spot there and avoid this place."

Regarding light, 1 euro for two hours, now in summer and without shadows it seems a bit expensive to me if you want to plug in to connect a refrigeration device, parking is prohibited throughout the municipality, but within the area you will find all kinds of vehicles , incomprehensible"
6579,3136954,4,Txinatarra,13/08/2023,"The site is complete. Well priced. It depends on the site has some inclination. The bathroom is a bit dirty but because people are very slutty because they clean it in the morning. To get there there is a ramp with a good slope, but nothing exaggerated."

6579,3104535,4,beprisa,08/08/2023,"A good space, to arrive in the evening. It would be better if it had the showers closed and with hot water, even if you had to pay for them. It would also be nice if it had shadows. It's okay if you come with children, there is a playground. Although the showers are cold. They charge by the hour, 0.42 cnt/h. It's very nice. It is one of the few that is worthwhile in Spain. Thanks to the people!"

6579,3082204,5,FrankHollywood,05/08/2023,"Very good, just to be recommended. The approach is absolutely steep, so better not approach with caravans. The springs can be reached in 10 minutes."
6579,3065298,5,marioLUA,02/08/2023,"We stayed on July 31, 2023. The shower is outside with cold water. The toilet very clean. The correct squares but not very large. Quiet place to sleep as there is no road nearby. It is in the upper part of the town. Ten minute walk. Although the return is uphill, and you have to take that into account. Thanks Arnedillo."
6579,3036310,2,LoreyKike,28/07/2023,"Impossible to put it further. First of all, the browser doesn't take you well to the parking lot. Then you have to climb a tremendous hill, I won't even tell you on foot. You only pay with a card. And up there, security as far from the town is normal as long as you're alone. The hot springs are amazing yes indeed."
6579,3012922,3,anfravi,24/07/2023,"You have to climb a big hill, but the bath in the pools is worth it"

6579,2851223,5,VirginiaSC,13/06/2023,"Very good area, to enjoy a walk along the greenway, or the hot springs. The bathrooms are quite clean, with light and easy to pay for parking. the walk to the village is uphill but not too long. We had dinner at a bar called La Huella, which was great, we were with a dog and they took great care of us. Highly recommended."
6579,2832599,5,CattinJ,08/06/2023,"Went for 1 night, stayed for 2 & could have stayed longer. Fabulous stop, thank you to the community.
Very clean, well designed facilities including toilets with loo paper/ soap.
Peaceful location with views of vultures and surrounded by beautiful scenery. Free hot springs nearby.
Only issue was steep road access.
Less than €10 a night (we exited during the day to explore the dinosaur route)"
6579,2823208,5,jocelynh,05/06/2023,"The views from this site are unbelievable. Very clean toilets. We stayed about 24 hours and paid less than €10 without electric. Don’t follow satnav to get there, instead follow the campervan signs in the town. The natural thermal pools are 10 minutes walk away and well worth a visit!"
6579,2812166,5,kemanamana,02/06/2023,Great place with a mega panorama. Everything is super organized here; Respect!! is paid at the machine. Down the street left then right is a natural thermal bath; Wow

6579,2786605,5,Greenvale999,26/05/2023,"Great stop for an overnight and to visit the hot springs. A 15 min walk to the springs and all up a steep hill to get back up but we'll worth it. Super quiet night with great views. All facilities working and clean, well done local councils for making this type of stop available."
6579,2765269,4,sastraka,19/05/2023,"It is well equipped, the bathrooms are clean and everything is correct. The problem is that it is a bit far from the center of town and uphill."
6579,2747478,4,avipepe,14/05/2023,"Excellent area, but the climb up to it is not suitable for people with walking difficulties since the unevenness is quite large"
6579,2746547,5,cassinisi,13/05/2023,"A perfect, quiet area, with water and WC, tables to eat, possibility of light, there are some places that are not level, most of them are, for very little money you have all this. If I have to say something to improve, I would put the option of some showers, even if they are paid. Also that there is some tough person who parks in town and goes up to wash the dishes and shit in the area without paying anything..."
6579,2714055,5,sgllobre,01/05/2023,"perfect location to visit the thermal pools. (crowded on weekends but worth the experience). area with wc, sink, gray and black emptying and filling. the first 15 minutes are not paid for if you want to fill or empty. price €0.42 per hour or €10 for 24 hours. there is a small park and picnic tables. dog friendly."
6579,2713804,5,EdurZ,01/05/2023,"A little hard to get there, but an area of 10, good views, with bathrooms that are cleaned every morning, sink, even a mini playground. Very cheap and good facilities"
6579,2711315,4,Furgui2017,30/04/2023,"Comfortable and complete area. Good views although not much shade for the summer. This bridge exceeded capacity. The greenway of the cidacos to Arnedo is highly recommended, a bath in the river hot springs at the end and any route through the mountains. It is a biosphere reserve."
6579,2709744,3,inakimen,30/04/2023,Massive motorhome area with vans exceeding the parking capacity. We do not have a place for motorhomes in the area or in the town car parks due to height limitations.
6579,2709586,3,Pedrito85,30/04/2023,We could not enter the crowded camper
6579,2699553,5,DominikPaul,26/04/2023,"Very nice pitch with a brutal view. Fresh water and gray water discharge are available. Garbage cans empty and clean. The toilets were cleaned in the evenings. There is WiFi all over the place, but the closer to the supply station, the better the connection. The WiFi password is specified with two F's. However, it only works with an F. At least that's how it was on 04/25/23."
6579,2692489,4,rhythmseeds,24/04/2023,Great vista and lovely and peaceful. Woke to the sound of a cuckoo. Beware Google maps route which took us up a very narrow dead end track in very heavy rain leading to a stressful 15 point turn in VW camper - plenty of space and nestled in the mountains
6579,2688953,4,campingcarqc,22/04/2023,"Camping area as a well-kept secret. Breathtaking view in the middle of the mountains, services present, we stayed there for 2 nights and took advantage of the free thermal baths by the river in the village that we overlook and a hike around the mountain opposite!"
6579,2685407,5,AntoJor,21/04/2023,"The place is in the middle of the mountains, the view is magnificent, a small farm right next to it where you can see horses. We took advantage of the place for 2 nights by going to bathe in the hot springs on foot. It was perfect and our daughter was happy to play in the games."
6579,2677695,4,abartontheroad,17/04/2023,Good pitch for 1 or 2 nights on a small hill in a paved parking lot. Great setting surrounded by rocks. Village within walking distance. There is a toilet but no showers. The toilets are rather mediocre clean. One star deduction for the price. €10 for 24 hours is too much.
6579,2668216,5,TxikiRo,13/04/2023,"the only drawback is that it is on the outskirts of town and on a hill with a fairly steep slope. otherwise a 10, even if you just want to empty and fill you have 15 minutes free."
6579,2661244,4,anaoma,11/04/2023,"Very good place, spectacular views, very quiet to spend the night. Next to the town and the natural hot springs. The only drawback is that the garbage cans were overflowing until this morning when they came to clean. maybe they should put larger containers."
6579,2658299,4,NuriaCama,10/04/2023,"Very quiet area with great views. It has all the services, it also has bathrooms and a sink. €10/day or hourly 42 cents/h The only drawback is the distance to the town. Everything and that it is only 1 km, it is all uphill with a lot of slope."
6579,2641652,1,Chrisknigh,05/04/2023,"42cent an hour. 
most spaces are uneven.
electric 1eur 2hrs.
couldn't work out WiFi. 
barriers don't open so great.
road to Aire is very very steep, we scrapped van in parts. 
capitalising."
6579,2638711,5,Lunatica66,04/04/2023,"Good quiet area and with super nice views, important to highlight the super slope of ascent and the wind that can rise at times. €1 2 hours of light."
6579,2633280,5,NomadasGrises,01/04/2023,Very quiet area with good views and a small park for children
6579,2624377,5,Zorzano,25/03/2023,"The area is very good with impressive views, it has a significant slope but it is close to the town, a very, very quiet place, tables and a playground."
6579,2591356,4,ostape,26/02/2023,"All parking spaces in Arnedillo have a height limit of 2 meters, so it is the only place with AC not only for sleeping, but also for parking. As others have said, there is a steep incline to get there. It is not to be done many times a day. the common rooms are very clean and the services are perfect. The wifi was not working when we were there. We called the tourist office to inform them of this. Let's see if they fix it"
6579,2590889,5,Familleballade1,25/02/2023,very nice and clean area with a very pleasant setting.
6579,2589294,5,Adri9228,24/02/2023,1 km from the baths. Clean toilets and very quiet place!
6579,2576091,5,garancelest,12/02/2023,"parking a few minutes from shops, hot springs and hiking departures, all services and toilets, parking under video surveillance. pretty views. just a fairly steep hill to get there."
6579,2564586,5,Serbumm,30/01/2023,Recommended area 100%. Nice views. Quiet and at the top of the town. Steep climb to reach the area but affordable.
6579,2558505,4,poessltour,23/01/2023,"Hourly payment (0.42€) is fantastic, thanks to the municipality! Parked near 'Pozas de Arnedillo' (hotsprings, google images!) for thermal bliss, and then here for vidange&refill and solar charging. Two water taps didn't work, but 3rd good pressure (bring a hose, connector there is broken). Road is a steep ascent, a bit of an adventure, but then the view - amazing. Huge birds circling - which?"
6579,2551873,4,Raimon73,14/01/2023,"Quite well, good views, and the slope, it costs. I liked it a lot, I put 4 stars for accessibility."
6579,2541458,5,leenclv,04/01/2023,"Very nice area for walking! The pitch was well equipped: clean sanitary facilities, water supply and electricity."
6579,2529129,3,Nuatrotera,26/12/2022,"I have come because of the good comments and I was disappointed, the area in general is good but it seems expensive to me that you also pay for electricity separately. That the sink is in the same place where the motorhomes empty seems very unpleasant and unhygienic to me. The spectacular views but the neglected and dirty environment. An area that could be 5 stars with a little more attention."
6579,2519302,4,sarabara,11/12/2022,"Large motorhome area, with good views, with water service, and electricity outlet, and public services. The only bad thing I would say is the hill you have to climb to get to the area."
6579,2501790,4,juancu713,21/11/2022,"Great place to spend the night. Very quiet, on the outskirts of town. The full day is €10, but you pay by the minute (€0.007/minute). The bathrooms were good, but not excessively clean (I guess because it was ""out of season""). It is the only but, because if they were clean I would put 5 stars, without a doubt. By the way, the landscape that you see is amazing."
6579,2498280,5,Cruizer76,17/11/2022,"Everything you need is there, even a (cold) outdoor shower."
6579,2495734,4,sergioZam,15/11/2022,"We made an express stop but the site is wonderful. It has a children's area, bathrooms, light sockets from €1. The first 15 min is free and then 45 cents per minute. The views are the ostia. The only flaw is that to go down to the town there is a significant slope. A few good laughs if we throw ourselves up."
6579,2494413,5,park4nightmimie,13/11/2022,"Magnificent, spacious and the hot springs 5 minutes away on foot, a real treat."
6579,2491202,4,en.liberty,11/11/2022,"Pleasant area. Only downside for me is the hill to climb to reach it. It still forces a lot on the editor. But the view up there is great, there are toilets, an outdoor shower, electrical terminals (1€ for 2 hours). there is a small park for children, it is lit and there are surveillance cameras. We are about 10 minutes walk from the hot baths which are great too."

We stayed for 24 hours more or less for €10. You have to pay with visa. Perfect to spend a couple of days climbing in the area or visit the hot springs. Thanks to the people for places like this!"

6579,2416099,5,guantxu,01/10/2022,"Very good area with all the services, with the Barrier very well, I have not had to stop because when I reached the barrier it has opened. Now you pay for the real time you spend and if you just want to empty and download, 15 minutes free."
6579,2396445,3,cervantes,23/09/2022,shame ! as before the barrier does not open! for 10 € it's disappointing !!
6579,2391881,4,ChrisAudran,21/09/2022,we were there for one night clean toilets the shower is outside and cold but good quiet location I did not almost go out because the camera had misread my plate a Spanish motorhome came to my help and I thank him once again a municipal agent came within 10 minutes to solve the problem and that even on a Sunday thank you to this gentleman I recommend this place.
6579,2389850,5,topcatski,20/09/2022,"Such a beautiful place! We used the freely accessible, free thermal baths and were able to make a nice e-bike tour to the Enciso reservoir (new). That was a particularly nice stop on our round trip through Spain."
6579,2364338,5,zurayargi,12/09/2022,"highly recommended area, very quiet, all services (the shower is cold water) for that price per day and there are few services It has very good views, we will repeat for sure"
6579,2358346,4,BelenT,10/09/2022,"Highly recommended area with all the services and a beautiful location, the downside is a slope that goes up well with the camper but it is steep and if you go down often or with children, or if it is hot it is uncomfortable. for the rest, thanks to the town hall, it is not very expensive either."
6579,2334406,5,albertoyjennifer,03/09/2022,"The area is very good, €10 for 24 hours: with water service, a sink, and bathrooms, and a mini park for children. It is high up and has great views. highly recommended"

6579,2318044,5,miguelF,29/08/2022,"I wish there were more areas like this. Tables, benches, children's games and beautiful views. Clean water, sink to wash pots, rubbish bins, toilets, gray and black water. They charge per minute, with a maximum of €10/day. There is a slope to get there but not impossible and you can come and go on foot to the town without problems. I was finally able to sleep without hearing a road! It was difficult for him to open the barrier but in the end he was fine."
6579,2306465,5,noevila13,26/08/2022,"An area 10, super well located at the top of the town with exceptional views, finally they take us into account somewhere! Very comfortable and super wide bathrooms, shower, sink to wash the dishes and wash clothes, a paved slope to get there, nothing out of the ordinary that people are very exaggerated! Worth."
6579,2292425,2,cesarbtt,23/08/2022,Away from town and anything. the worst thing is that this distance is a slope of 20%. The barrier to enter was not opened for us and we had to call a telephone. to get out another mess. You have to pay by card but we did not recognize the license plate. I think it's better to sleep somewhere else
6579,2278952,1,Vitessepierrot,21/08/2022,Inaccessible area...camera system for opening the barrier...random with hill start at 20%....just to shoot the clutch...turn around almost impossible if the barrier does not open... .in addition to the exorbitant cost of parking....
6579,2271421,4,Andok,20/08/2022,"The area in general is very good. Good views, it has bathrooms, a quiet place... the only drawback is that it is far from the town and to go up or down there is a very steep slope, complicated by bike."

6579,2234481,3,insnay,14/08/2022,Clean area with all services. Card payment when leaving. It is important to check that the entry time is correct when leaving (we entered around 8:00 p.m. and it told us that we had arrived around 9:00 a.m.). Pay before placing the caravan at the exit. Slight incline (chocks). Noisy night today by group of campers until after midnight (bad luck). Thank you council for the area.
6579,2210225,5,benou64,10/08/2022,"Very nice stopover! Clean parking, beautiful view, very fair price (0.34€/h). The village of Arnedillo has a very nice municipal swimming pool at 3€ for the day (you can get out and come back). Beautiful hikes in the surroundings, well worth the detour"
6579,2173397,4,Patrikemma,04/08/2022,"Clean area and services in good condition. You go up a very steep concrete ramp with a barrier at the end that reads the license plate when entering and exiting. You pay €0.007/min when leaving; card payment only. Little shade in summer. On August 2 there were parties in the town and music was heard at night. The town does not have anywhere to park motorhomes, as all car parks have gauge."
6579,2173368,2,ana777,04/08/2022,"Large and flat parking, with services for €10. very clean and quiet. with swing area for children. but away from the town with a significant slope, there was no shade at all."

6579,2146405,4,Eduardomsmf,30/07/2022,"The area is fine, it has all the emptying and filling services, bathrooms, and an outdoor shower. A small playground, well lit. It costs €10 = 24h, and electricity €1 = 2h. The thermal pools are 400m away, but the road leading up to the area is 200 meters with quite a slope but it goes up. Upon reaching the barrier a camera reads the license plate and you enter without stopping. You pay when you leave (only with card)"
6579,2104432,5,Sandalias,21/07/2022,"The area is great, paved, flat, with lighting, benches and tables. €10. Spectacular environment. The town is very beautiful with natural pools at a temperature of 40 degrees, there is a municipal swimming pool, beautiful walks. The road up to the area is 200 meters with quite a slope but it goes up without much problem, when you reach the barrier a camera reads the license plate and you enter without stopping. A 10."
6579,2096383,4,RuTaJiEm,20/07/2022,"Very good area. They have installed a barrier and an ATM to pay ONLY by card for the stay. They charge you for fractions 0.07 per minute or €10 for the full day. You pay when you leave. The only drawback is the entrance has a very steep slope, that's why I don't give it a 5. Thank you."
6579,2043079,5,SipsParritta,06/07/2022,Good AC. Too bad q with the 10 € no and enter the light. If you go with children will you suffer on the climb?
6579,2031235,4,Andjoc,02/07/2022,"Indeed the return to the area after having taken advantage of the hot springs, and a little tough. very clean toilets. A bit expensive as electricity is not included, but it's a seaside town so it's worth the 10€."
6579,2026407,5,d_maeel,01/07/2022,"Very good car park with electricity, toilets and water (be careful not to get too close to the waters, there are still relans) 10 minutes on foot from the hot springs and paid electricity. someone comes by around 9 a.m. to pay for the parking lot. some complain about the coast but with 2 legs it works and there is a great view"
6579,1937473,4,yjanin,01/06/2022,really a little paradise with all the amenities and even an outdoor shower... certainly no shade but we make do with it. Thanks to the municipality.

6579,1885178,2,pulga1,12/05/2022,"It does not seem like a paid area to me, the enclave is nice but the access is not, expensive on foot and with an electric bike it also costs very steep and the services???? For me it leaves a lot to be desired, the only thing is the electricity points, paying"
6579,1870192,5,SaraJN,04/05/2022,"Fantastic place at the top of the village with mountain views. Access looks tricky - steep road up - but go for it, it’s worth it at the top! 5-10 minute walk to the hot springs which are AMAZING. Close to bars and shop. Toilets, water etc. Flat concrete pitch. Childrens playpark. Usually costs 10e which we would happily pay but machine was broken.  Thankyou to the village for this facility."
6579,1830481,5,oso-caracol,17/04/2022,"Area with many places, we arrived on Easter Saturday at 11pm and there was room!!!!. Clean, very quiet, well equipped and in a beautiful setting. To put some downside, the climb from the spa (although it is not much either)"
6579,1828547,5,JuantxuJauregui,16/04/2022,"Deluxe. wonderful place and very well kept. The impeccable services and that it was full, some fallen paper but a kid thing. To return without hesitation. They are setting up a barrier at the entrance and a machine, I understand that to pay for the stay, but it is not yet up and running. by the way, electricity is 1 euro for two hours, it can be accumulated. The machine only accepts 1 euro coins."
6579,1826073,5,PMerino,16/04/2022,"Good place to sleep, several park routes for children and all services including WiFi and electricity, many thanks to the town hall"
6579,1803868,5,Lorea10,02/04/2022,"bucolic place in the middle of beautiful mountains. 10 euros per night, with clean toilets. An employee of the town hall passes in the morning to collect. It is worth it, a town with interesting walks both on foot and by bicycle. Outdoor hot springs. Walk through a long tunnel, where the train once ran."
6579,1796230,5,AnVie,26/03/2022,"Clean toilets, garbage disposals and free drinking water. flat pitches with views of beautiful mountains. The town of Arnedillo spoils motorhomes! thanks to them"
6579,1737698,1,okcorral,20/01/2022,"At €10 per day, or fraction, and €1 for 2 hours of light? Parking is prohibited in the entire urban area. They have put 2m caps on all parking lots. With this, what they have achieved is that those parking lots are filled with vans, in one alone we already have 6, cooking on the asphalt and filling everything with crap. The town, apart from the hot water pools, is of no interest. bye"
6579,1721869,4,larocagigas,01/01/2022,Sleeping area with a beautiful setting. very calm. The Lord of the City Council has come to collect in the morning. The hot springs are a 6 minute walk away. Very well clean and paper toilets. there is an outside shower.
6579,1704503,4,trillonyotero,06/12/2021,"Very good area to spend the night and do routes, but a little expensive to spend just a few hours. Even though we didn't have to pay, let's face it."
6579,1701508,4,GotzonValde,01/12/2021,"For 10 euros a night, a very adequate area. It offers all the services."

They are free and there are lockers. The guy working there told us to look after our stuff, not to leave it on the benches but right next to you - or use the lockers. Tip: go early in the morning, less crowded and the water is wonderful clean. The parking area has a toilet which was well maintained."
6579,1675332,4,Festin,02/11/2021,"Very good payment area (€ 10 that they charge you by hand in the mornings around 9 o'clock), with all services, electricity € 1 -2 hours. Very quiet, good views, perhaps a square a little uneven, near the town, with a good access ramp."
6579,1670442,5,kaparreta,31/10/2021,Area with water load and discharge. Also electricity. € 10 / day that a man comes in the morning to charge you. It has video surveillance.

Mountain biking and trekking routes.
6579,1667119,3,Olaf.In.A.Van,29/10/2021,"Nice view and reasonably quiet. However, the price is too high. € 10 for parking. Without a shower. Without electricity. By the way, electricity was twice as expensive. Now costs € 1 for 2 hours. We were charged two days even though we came at midnight."
6579,1661308,4,jon_koala,25/10/2021,"For 10 euros a night it is all included except electricity, to put one downside ... the cost to get to the area. A very good and very quiet area."

I have been coming with CARAVANA for many years and I love it has all the services of filling, emptying, light ... swings for children and a lot of mountain to do routes. Agustín passes around 9 in the morning to charge 10 euros for the night. Thank you !!!!!!!!"
6579,1641753,4,Pedro_61,12/10/2021,"The area is fine and at night you can not hear anything, perfect for sleeping, emptying and filling, the access is quite steep and narrow, walking up because it costs a bit."
6579,1640118,5,sonrisusan,12/10/2021,"Aupa! We had a great Sunday night! It's steep, but not so steep. Gu with two children. Too many people in terms, but we got into it. We paid € 10 at 9.30am, jiji. He gave us a card (chess caves; time must be taken) and invitations to enter (mirador de los buitres). And by entering € 50 at the gas station, you get € 5 for free. So free midnight. Thank you very much!!!"
6579,1638858,5,jonatanpardo,11/10/2021,We paid € 10 per night but we were very good. The very friendly town hall employee gave us a € 5 discount voucher to refuel at a gas station (minimum € 50 refueling). He also gave us an invitation to see the checkered cave for free to see vultures. It has services for ACs.

6579,1623917,5,hectorom21,03/10/2021,"well prepared area, with all services and nestled in a magical place! The downside is the ramp that we have to access the town, but the tranquility and the possibilities of the mountain that we have around makes it worth it. There are some very cool routes to do either walking or running through the mountains."
6579,1609873,5,TxusetsRuth,26/09/2021,"Very well, located on a hill with beautiful views. It has room for many motorhomes. They charge € 10 a day, they charge around 9am. They give you a € 5 voucher for the Arnedo gas station. Very busy, it has a playground where children gather, a great detail. Thank you very much to the city council."
6579,1602118,3,Annika123,23/09/2021,"Adress not correct!! Google maps will lead you down some very small and steep roads. Just follow the signs in the village. For 10€ per night Okay. You have a nice view, quiet surroundings. Only the toilets were very dirty and it seemed that there wasn't anyone to clean them. The shower is an outside shower with no cabin. But we went to the hot springs just 10 minutes walk from the parking."

6579,1488462,2,blangrisma,20/08/2021,Good area to rest. Cool nights in summer. Silence and tranquility. To get to it there is an important ramp but it does not involve much difficulty. Clean bathrooms. Cold water outdoor shower. It can be emptied and filled. Also sink for dishes. I give it 2 stars for a reason: at 8:30 in the morning they knock on the door to pay the € 10. Please change the system.
6579,1480572,5,AlbertperonoAnderstein,19/08/2021,"Very quiet area with services, bathrooms, cold water shower, discharge of black and gray water, the workers of the town hall pass to collect in the morning. The ascent slope is steep but I have climbed without problem with a 7-meter caravan. The hot water pools and visit to the town are highly recommended."
6579,1473966,5,TheChiki,17/08/2021,"Highly recommended area. It costs € 10 per day and the departure time is at 6pm. They allow tables and chairs to be taken out, the town hall operator has confirmed this to us. Very quiet, 10 minutes from Las Pozas. It has an area for emptying and filling water, bathrooms, and an outdoor cold water shower. There is also a playground for children, picnic tables and electricity outlets. We stayed 2 nights."
6579,1473391,2,juditmauri,17/08/2021,"Quiet area € 10. The slope is not so much, we with an integral of 7.40m we have climbed well but we do not feel like walking up it. The pool and hot springs are a 5-minute walk away. To pay, the boy came at 8:00 p.m. The shower is on the street and is cold water. Electricity € 1 2h. With a motorhome you can only be in this area because the car parks have a maximum height of 2m."
6579,1459110,4,Rafacorca,15/08/2021,"Quiet and pleasant area, with very beautiful views, somewhat far from the town especially because it is in the upper part and there is a significant slope to get there, walking surely it bites. We get on a motorcycle, we take that off"
6579,1431418,1,PatriR18,09/08/2021,"Arnedillo seems to us like a town not a friend of this world, all the car parks with a height of 2 meters except this € 10 per day, with a cushion climb and to go down to the town .... which you don't feel like because then you have to climb it .... anyway, there are many towns that are worth more. sorry arnedillo. Bye"
6579,1413326,4,bg_alberto,06/08/2021,"It is very good to do the night, it empties waters and fills very well. In August we stayed one night during the week with three motorhomes, perhaps the only downside is that it is not level, most of them have to be chocked."
6579,1404124,5,AnaRomero,04/08/2021,"€ 10 / night. At 9 in the morning the manager comes to collect and they give you a € 5 discount voucher for a Repsol gas station in Arnedo. Chairs, tables and awning allowed to be taken out. Wide and asphalt area, the only downside is You have to go up a very steep ramp. The hot springs are a good option to visit with children, as is the tunnel of the greenway of the town."

6579,1342071,3,ticu,19/07/2021,"In summer better not to go, without shade. To go to the pools you have a good descent that later you will have to climb. What I see as inappropriate is that the town has parking spaces down the road and they all have a maximum clearance of 2 meters, if you only want to go to Las Pozas they won't let you park IT DOESN'T SEEM SUITABLE in case someone of a certain age goes wants to soak."
6579,1337468,4,Innaki,18/07/2021,"We have spent two nights, Thursday through Saturday. The first very quiet night, the second very noisy, at ten three motorhomes arrived and they began to have dinner as if there were no one around.

6579,956871,3,cheteac,13/08/2020,"The area is very good, with all services, but fatally located. It is located at the top of the town and to access it you have to climb a good hill. Once there, you wonder if it is worth going down to town. In the town you can park from 9:00 to 22:00, with which we go down with the motorhome. It is highly recommended to pedal along the Vía Verde del Cidacos."
6579,944439,5,Sev2105,09/08/2020,Very beautiful air. The coast is very important to go up to the parking lot. A gentleman comes by around 9 a.m. in the morning waiting for payment. You have to walk down to the sources because there is a bar 2m away for the parking lot below

6579,826786,2,Trejo_Haro,16/06/2020,"To get there you have to work the considerable uphill. For people of an age, it is complicated. Very expensive, € 10, for an area to take up the butt in the heights, although the views are not bad, with various slopes, making it difficult or impossible to sleep on the flat and the light goes to part of the € 10. I get the feeling that the most recent comments are from people there. Has public toilets"
6579,819917,4,fanyt65,09/06/2020,"Very well maintained area, the city council worker comes in the morning and now with the coronavirus it has disinfected all the outdoor tables and common areas, even when they are closed. The only downside is the climb, although the views are spectacular, it is the access, it costs very steep, our AC of 7 m went up without a problem but to climb by bike or children worse. The cost is € 10 a day and € 1 2 hours of light. Town with public baths, spa, river, path with greenway for bicycles and walks and very welcoming. Animals are allowed and it is very quiet."

The toilets were open, clean and stocked. The water and waste facilities were all clean and functioning. The 20 minute walk to the free thermal baths was worth the effort. We only parked 10:30-12:30 during which time there was no one to pay any fees to."
6579,786519,3,metaliko,25/02/2020,"The area is fine, today Tuesday the bathrooms are not very clean but there is also a lack of civility on the part of the people, dirty lettuce sink, only guilty campers. On the other hand, it is not to be appreciated that they charge you 10 euros and put you on top of a hill as if you would have the coronavirus, when there is parking closer to the town, where 2m vehicles can park."

6579,765281,5,cmoi33200,06/01/2020,"Great place, a little steep access, very nice view. Impeccable sanitary. To advice. The icing on the cake, on December 31st, we were surprised to see the village mayor knocking on the door of our camper vans to wish us a happy new year and offer us a bottle of wine. This is like the municipal employees and merchants in the village. Thank you all for your welcome."
6579,753938,5,redpsy,15/12/2019,"Another great spot especially if you come to hot spirngs (free) or travel around. Steep road to the place and can be difficult in rain or frozen days. 10 euro per night will be collected at around 9am. Electrictiy, 1e for 2h. free water and grey water disposal.

There are also some campers parked in front of the university (50 meters away) (I think for free). But we decided on the 7.60 euros per night. The bus leaves 100 meters away and costs 1.86 pp

However, there is a park with a barrier at 1.90m that only has 2 cars and that, in part, could serve for many motorhomes. So they park on the streets on the outskirts and some are blocked by the police. We thank the Gathering and ask for more seats."
6580,3216123,4,8574VanToR,25/08/2023,Crowded car park but with a little luck the place can be found because there is enough turnover. Quiet for the night because away from the road. With a 20-minute walk you arrive at the beach and with 45 minutes you arrive in the center. Advised

You think it's all covered, but that's not necessarily the case. Ticket Automat has no language change, only Spanish. V and E in need of renovation. Doesn't look very hygienic. About 20 minutes by bike to the city. Parking duration max. 72 hours"

6580,3187965,4,gastonlecombi,20/08/2023,"Difficult to find a small place. No shade. Very well placed in the city (close to the beach). We felt safe and calm during the night. 2 disadvantages: very small area, which makes it difficult to get a place and very noisy from 9am when all the motorhomes are emptying."
6580,3187905,2,Prosk,20/08/2023,"The free services. But in pretty bad condition. the cesspool is saved. Although being close to the clean waters. people clean the Poti in the drinking water tap. The faucet is over-threaded, the cesspool faucet is off track and very difficult to use. If you have the opportunity to go to another site to use the emptying and filling services, do so."
6580,3179753,4,GiancarloRuggi,19/08/2023,Parking area close to the city center which can also be reached on foot if you want to take a nice walk. Otherwise there are several bus lines that pass frequently and arrive directly in the center. Water loading and unloading. A laundry is also nearby. It is advisable to get there in the morning before 10.
6580,3161625,4,CapitanoFindus,16/08/2023,"Very convenient parking, to find a place you should arrive around 10:00. The parking limit is 72 hours. It does not have any toilet facilities but offers water loading and unloading. San Sebastian is easily accessible both by bike and on foot."

6580,3149451,3,LyseoHarmony,15/08/2023,In itself a great place to visit the city. In the high season (August) it is a challenge to get a place. But we did it. If you arrive on time (10 a.m.) spots become available regularly. Payment device worked complex. You could choose the language. If you chose English it stayed on Spanish language. If you chose the French language you got the English menu.
6580,3149215,2,Lilyviajera,15/08/2023,"The area is small and practically impossible to find a place, the first night we spent in the blue and green zone next door, but the next day the police picked us up because a neighbor had complained (according to the police they had called them 6 times) to At 9 at night we looked for another place, the next day those who did not move were fined. Be careful also to cross the lines of the ground."

But access also possible by bike because little difference in height. The black/grey water emptying is public and can be done even if you don't sleep in the car park Many CCs park in the streets around if there is no space

6580,3118501,1,CG1980,10/08/2023,"Unfortunately one of the most crowded places I had ever visited via Park4Night. On the way to the actual place an indescribable number of campers, in every street and side street, in both directions! ☹️. Surely over 100 who didn't get a place. We then drove on to Santu-Enea, had a parking lot to ourselves with toilet, water and picnic tables."
6580,3112963,3,MaxBis,10/08/2023,"Rather small area for the request. I recommend arriving in the morning. Fairly silent. €7.50/24h. Loading-unloading and toilet service with queue. No toilet or shower. If full, you can park in the adjacent streets ABSOLUTELY RESPECTING THE RULES: only parking and staying in the marked spaces: the police pass in the morning and put the irregular jaws on them."
6580,3106054,3,LesParisiens,09/08/2023,"The air is quite noisy because there is traffic even at night, it is much too small, there are motorhomes everywhere in the adjacent streets. We had to spend a night there before finding a place. Which is positive. It is only 15 minutes walk from the beach"
6580,3104544,1,rifmovilhome,08/08/2023,Here in this city the mayor treats us like immigrants. It is very embarrassing that I come from 4000 kilometers and we do not have a safe place to rest and we are all lying in the streets. You can look at this point because a person invests as a property and some of them are worth much more. I ask you to look. Currently the world has changed a lot but you continue with the Hippie concept.
6580,3103984,5,kwochner,08/08/2023,"There are recycling bins just outside the square a few meters up the road. It is best not to stand in the last row in front of the disposal station. This can be smelled at times. From midday there are no more free places in the high season and you can save yourself the attempt, since all places change in the morning."

6580,3090424,5,tOnIp,06/08/2023,Very comfortable to visit the center by bus. It is 20-30min away and there is a lot of frequency. The water is very slow and there is a queue to refill. Quiet place to sleep.
6580,3083940,4,javeasteve5,05/08/2023,"If you can get in then it’s worth it, basically level, quiet except for early morning door slamming, well lit at night with working services. Regular Police patrols and a 20 minute walk to beach. Beach front amazing, no tat shops just 3k of promenade overlooking sea. Loads of MH’s parked all around in streets, think you still have to pay for at least part of day."
6580,3077391,3,JoanBonhof,04/08/2023,"The camper place was overcrowded. However, there were still a few times as many campers in the surrounding streets. In the morning fines were handed out if the camper did not fit in a compartment."

You can enter to empty and fill without paying anything. For 24 hours they are €7.6 and outside the area it is a blue zone, with which you also pay. The bad thing is that the water intake is not good and in addition to going very slow there was no way to thread the hose with any coupling"
6580,3017951,3,MagicMike888,25/07/2023,"When we weren't there for two hours, someone either wanted to steal my bike or have a dangerous joke. Four parts were missing for our bike rack and we couldn't continue without them! Place was ok. We came at noon (1 p.m.) and were initially not given a seat. In the afternoon at 3 p.m. something happened to be free. Best come in the morning."

6580,3008413,5,AndreAraujo,23/07/2023,"Very well located and quiet. Cafes, restaurants and market nearby. By bike or even on foot, you can easily reach the beach and the centre. During the season it is usually full, but as the maximum stay is 72 hours, it is possible to get a seat if you arrive between 10am and 12pm. There were many motorhomes parked in nearby streets as well."
6580,3006887,4,KarinLeroy,23/07/2023,"Certainly ok to visit the city. Very good cycle paths and in 10 minutes in the center. We were lucky, someone just left. So maybe it's best to wait?"

We parked 2 nights on Avda next to the university, next to other ACs, without problems. Bus 5,25,45 direct to the center. Be careful because it is a blue zone and you have to pay during the week, in the end you don't have to pay for a blue zone. A few meters away is the AC park to evacuate and free water filling."
6580,2991575,4,Mira2804,20/07/2023,Were only here during the day. You pay 7.60 for 24 hours. You walk about 30-40 to the beach and into town.
6580,2984781,3,RalfF.,18/07/2023,The location and the connection to public transport speak for the place. The charm and the condition of the supply and disposal rather against it. OK in terms of value for money and available alternatives.
6580,2972246,4,alex.b33,16/07/2023,"area well located no noise. The only downside is for garbage and water (smell but bearable). City visited, 15 min walk to the beach."

6580,2960205,4,MarcusHolmberg,13/07/2023,A decent place for a motorhome area close to San Sebastian. The bus to town goes frequently from the road just outside and there are several cafés and restaurants in the area

There is a lot of coming and going every day Only clean and dirty water. Nothing else. €7.50 per day. Relaxed place. You must be completely self-sufficient! Tip: when entering a payment terminal, choose the option: license plate for foreign license plate."
6580,2955339,3,CharlesAudrey24,12/07/2023,"We arrived early as advised, there was plenty of space but, whilst a useful service area, beyond that it’s just a car park. There were too many people around, someone local trying to sell a van and the location is not particularly close to anywhere. We spent most of our time at Passealuka Berria and camped at Mt. Ulia."
6580,2946690,4,CattinJ,10/07/2023,"As always, very hard to get spaces especially in summer but if you're lucky enough to grab one, then it's a great place to visit the town. Quite a long walk to the old town but definitely worth it. Safe neighborhood. Very close to other vans. €7.60."

6580,2871625,5,Oldistar,19/06/2023,We were here in mid-April 2023. At 12 o'clock there were still a few places available in San Sebastián / Donostia. The parking ticket machine is a bit tricky: it actually only cost 3.30€/night. The bus stop is not far (bus tickets are available from the bus driver with a credit card); a visit to the beautiful old town is definitely worthwhile.
6580,2861454,5,fiforose,16/06/2023,"Of course we're not used to being so close to each other but good for spending a night or two and visiting the city it's still not bad and for 7euros 60 for 24 hours I think it's ok, however you have to arrive early I think because we arrived at 5:30 p.m. out of the 44 places there was only one left good stay in San Sebastian it is a very beautiful city"
6580,2859707,5,schnorls,16/06/2023,"Functional but great place for campers near to the town of San Sebastian. Very very crowded, basically all slots are taken all the time. In the morning you have best chances. Police regularly checks, so don't just stand in non official slots. 7,6€/24h via terminal which is a bit complicated - change language by pressing ""Castellano"" in corner down right. Public toilets in library 5 min footwalk."
6580,2856980,5,veridas,15/06/2023,"a quiet and ideal place! very cheap to park all day, 1.5 km from the old part and the beach 1 km, the problem is that it is very small and it is always full, those who say it is expensive travel little there... you can shower the showers on the beach (€1.50) note that they have hours in low season, only those of the yacht club are open until 6:00 p.m."
6580,2856454,1,lucasabogado,15/06/2023,"It's a parking lot, I'm sorry for the town hall but it's a measure... €7.60 for parking 24 hours is robbery, take it or leave it."

Vans with small children who make noise till late at night & early morning (not their fault but would be better on a campsite). Service point on access road so queue blocks the road. Everyone needs to be efficient & some are not! A bigger Aire is needed."
6580,2831576,5,WillSexton,08/06/2023,if you can get a space this place is superb. Amazing cycle into town and very reasonably priced. Services worked great for us.
6580,2828615,4,FabrizioCn,07/06/2023,"More a parking lot than a rest area. Among other things, pay attention to small vehicles registered in vans: here they consider them not campers and try to give a very questionable fine in my opinion. Also because the thing is absolutely not indicated and I've never seen the thing practiced in any case. Camper service present!"

20min walk to the beach."
6580,2815465,2,Costablanca,03/06/2023,An area that is too small for a city like San Sebastián. We went at 10am and it was already full. We won't be back.
6580,2812669,4,DGC680,02/06/2023,"Great parking lot. From June 1st €7.6/24h (before €3.3). You stand tight, but with 6.8m Womo had enough space. Grey/black possible, fresh water and garbage cans available. The best chance of a free slot in the morning, but there are also free slots in the afternoon. For €1.6 you can have a hot shower on the beach (like the indoor pool, with individual/group showers and lockers). It was quiet at night."
6580,2811802,5,Sorginbidaiaria,02/06/2023,"Fabulous area where for 3 euros a day, you can sleep peacefully just a short walk from the beach. Change of waters. The place is very quiet day and night despite being in the city. We will definitely repeat on our next visit.

6580,2802344,1,JaneWoodman,30/05/2023,"Actually, the place deserves a better rating, good location to the beach and the old town, great cycle path network. In a calm neighborhood. Unfortunately, despite having a valid parking ticket, we received a tuber of 42 euros. Apparently only large mobile homes are allowed here, no small campervans (VW buses also had parking tickets)!"

6580,2782529,3,Weisenbach,24/05/2023,"For €3.40 per 24 hours a great place in such a big city. The places can be a bit too short for big ""ships"". You can easily cycle into town and to the beach. Simply through the car park and then the excellent cycle path begins at the roundabout. San Sebastian has a very good cycle path network."

We liked that the toilets by the beach also have very reasonably priced lockers and showers.
So good to be able to access all that the area has. 
Thank you to the city for this aire."
6580,2777083,4,IvyKiwy,22/05/2023,Very good for a night or two. Great location to see the old town of San Sebastian. Very easy to reach by bike or bus. There is no toilet/shower on site. Price more than okay: 3.30 for 24 hours. The night was surprisingly quiet and we felt very safe. We would come again.
6580,2770540,5,Jbx87,21/05/2023,"Very pleasant quiet area at night, great bike path in all directions.

Definitely COME EARLY! Black & grey waste dump, fresh water fill (via very short cycle push button tap) - fresh is around the back of the black waste dump point (itself under the silver lid) - need small thread tap adapter. 40min walk to the old town."

6580,2751681,4,cgutrero,15/05/2023,"Thanks to the Town Hall. Well located and clean. The beach is close. For people with dogs it is great (from June to September it is prohibited). The area is not big, you have to get there early to find a place. The clean faucet has a very small thread and although we took what we thought was a good assortment of adapters, we have not succeeded. We saw the same thing happen to other people."

6580,2729278,5,Kareel,06/05/2023,"The place is unbeatable for this price! The city has thought along with this and offers motorhome fans a great opportunity to supply and dispose of waste cheaply, as well as to visit the city without much effort. You can walk to the city in 20 minutes or the center in 3 minutes by bus."
6580,2720880,5,PoloSNT,03/05/2023,"Very practical and well located area. Peaceful place. Places quite wide and flat. To reach the center either 40 min on foot or by bus 33 at 200m which runs every 20 min (journey €1.85)! Parking €3.30 for 24 hours, black and gray water emptying, lots of free water. To be sure to have one, it is absolutely necessary to arrive there in the morning, before noon it is full!"
6580,2706857,5,MF1,29/04/2023,Arrived early morning  got a place - always people leaving so it is just luck that gets you a place.

6580,2683911,4,Appetute,20/04/2023,"Very well located parking space, ideal for visiting Donostia/SanSebastian. The pitches are narrow, so it gets tight even for a small chair. The costs of €3.30 pN in the off-season are more than fair. There is no electricity but full V/E. Since the place is usually fully booked, please arrive early and also allow some time for disposal and supply..."
6580,2681948,4,gaelrimbod,19/04/2023,"quite well placed (15min walk from a beautiful beach) and a very good little restaurant 7 min from the tximistarri, however you have to come early because the motorhome park is not very big and it is quickly full"

Quite a walk to town but well worth it. Use bottom pink button on parking meter (push twice) to get instructions in English, can pay by cash or card. Has fresh water and can empty grey/black waste. Had peaceful night's sleep, ideal!"

Was a little loud with everyone being crammed together which is no real surprise. That said at only €3.30 per 24hrs it’s perfect for spending the day away from your van exploring a great city."
6580,2656157,5,LivingInLuna,10/04/2023,"Fantastic place…. Most leave early in the morning so your best bet is getting a spot around 10:00am… would 100% return here, beautiful city, great kebab shop 5 mins walk, decent enough Dia supermarket 5 min walk…. Old town around 35min walk, beach around 15min walk… lots to see here! With the machine to pay press the box in the bottom right that says CASTELLANO twice and it will change to English"

As per other comments, this is a very popular place so you need to arrive early to get a spot when someone leaves.  The pay machine is tricky to use.  Press the pink panel which allows you to select instructions in English."
6580,2647826,3,Mape8203,07/04/2023,"The place itself was very well located and lit. Subsoil grass pavers. Price in low season €3.30 for 24 hours. 10 min walk to town. To the beach about 15 minutes. One drawback were the small car campers, which sometimes pushed you on the Pelle even though there were no more spaces available. Highly recommended for a short stop if you are lucky enough to get a seat."

Stayed one night and it was so peaceful, listening to owls hooting in the night and woodpeckers pecking in the morning.  Get there early, before lunchtime. Bus 33 into the old town from round the corner - €1.85. Would recommend. Thank you for the facility."
6580,2620607,4,Aviator,23/03/2023,"Good parking lot and because it's cheap (3.30) and right next to the bus, anyway close to town, we give it 4 stars. No electricity and cramped, hence a star deduction. At the end of March, at 2:00 p.m., all seats were taken! Numbers a bit tricky. A bit difficult for over 8m. We would come again."
6580,2619880,3,Almanat,22/03/2023,"The plots are very narrow, but great for exploring the city for the price. Our night was not so pleasant, since an XXL camper party was partying until 2 a.m. and another camper thought he was the only one at 3 a.m. and started his generator."

But the place is very small and the pitches very narrow, you stand next to each other like sardines. Unfortunately, it also stinks from the drain even into the mobile home. It's also very loud in the morning, rubbish collection and when everyone drives to the disposal site, doors slamming and loud conversations, you can't sleep after 8 a.m."

We lucked out with the last spot around 12.30pm on Sunday, so be on time. You saw many campers driving around and looking for a place. In terms of atmosphere, it is less, it is a parking lot where you are close to each other. So you can't sit outside."

6580,2487664,5,Txekio,08/11/2022,"Excellent motorhome area. Ideally go in the morning as it fills up very easily. 15 minutes walk from Ondarreta beach. Bus, bike lane and supermarket next door. To put a hit on it, the black emptying area is a bit ugly, the rest without hitch."
6580,2487159,2,egoman,08/11/2022,"Totally overcrowded, some Womos park in the driving loop and even in the disposal area so that you have to back out again. The menu of the ticket machine is not simple. All users needed multiple attempts. The disposal area seemed very unclean, I didn't use it."
6580,2483575,5,kikimorand,05/11/2022,Very well placed and 5 minutes from the buses. Clean water and dirty water drains and WC. No electricity. Very calm
6580,2478770,5,cuncanes,02/11/2022,"Good place to spend the night, 20 minutes from La Concha beach walking quietly. Quiet site. Cost of €3.5 per day and with water service. Good zone."
6580,2477537,4,emax88,01/11/2022,Convenient area to visit San Sebastian by bike but parking too close and tight. Better to move in the morning to find a place. Easy loading and unloading. Low price for city area € 3.10.
6580,2465611,5,Isabel567,27/10/2022,"very good area. Very good access for motorhomes of all sizes. There are not many places, there was a queue of people waiting to see if other motorhomes would come out. loading and unloading area, garbage and 30 minutes from downtown. It is level and without noise to rest. Very cheap, €3.50 a day."
6580,2463596,5,hectorvandevan,26/10/2022,"Cheap place super close to downtown. the only drawbacks are that it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and the nearest public toilet is 15 minutes away. Meanwhile, a maximum duration of 3 days no longer applies to just 2."
6580,2461915,1,YadiVJ,25/10/2022,Area for motorhomes and I see many camper vans that can park anywhere taking up spaces.
6580,2461647,1,denisbaudier,25/10/2022,too many people piled up disappointed there is not enough parking for camping car forced to sleep on the side of the too touristy road pity that he does not think more about the camper!!!
6580,2455987,5,jovila,22/10/2022,quiet place 20min. walking from the shell walk. water source and gray water tank. €3.30 for 24 hours and €6.60 for 48 hours. ideal place. Better go early to find a seat.
6580,2455804,3,HelmutMeyer,22/10/2022,"Narrow, not very nice WoMo parking space, but perfect to visit San Sebastian and with 3.30 euros / 24 hours. very cheap in the off-season. The number of places is too small for this city and many WoMo had to drive on."
6580,2454383,4,hornijudo,21/10/2022,"When we arrived at 4 p.m. everything was full and we moved to another place nearby and were successful the next morning (10 a.m.). The places are very narrow, but you want to visit the city. Operating the parking machines is not that easy and the machines are very slow. This applies to all parking machines. So please bring patience!"
6580,2452944,5,lukedani,20/10/2022,Top location to visit the city. yes it is a busy place but you can safely leave your camper. Recommended!
6580,2449060,4,Frank209d,17/10/2022,"Stress-free and inexpensive way to visit San Sebastian, if necessary with an overnight stay. Not a nice place, no shade, relatively quiet, supply / disposal, no electricity. The old town can be reached by bike in 15 minutes, about 2km to Ondarreta Beach."

6580,2445771,4,Sandravng,15/10/2022,"Site near the beach of la concha, next to the bus stop, a very good price. To give it 5 stars, it would need to be able to connect to the electricity, I understand that paying more would not matter, but offering that service would be fine"
6580,2445348,5,tetardlife,15/10/2022,Perfect at a very very good price! Next to buses to town and quiet! Be careful to arrive very early to have a place!
6580,2439779,4,Moby67,12/10/2022,Excellent park very cheap and ideal to walk to beach and old town. Has water and empty services. Is very popular so fills up quickly.
6580,2437873,1,Curly39,11/10/2022,Park-up full at 2pm. Large number of motorhomes circling hoping for a space. None of the nearby park-ups were suitable for a 6m campervan. Drove onto France.
6580,2433935,5,PeterMcGoran,09/10/2022,great spot in the city centre for the price. spent one night. (28/03/22)
6580,2431045,5,margoota,08/10/2022,beautiful air of motorhome to visit Sn sebastian. ideal and calm. lots of people get there preferably in the morning
6580,2423006,5,srul,04/10/2022,"Great place. Not very much place. It’s not free, you need to pay parking. Between 1/10 to 1/05 it’s 3.30€ per day."
6580,2416023,5,ManuelGG,01/10/2022,"Great area, we didn't spend the night, we visited the city and emptied and loaded water, 20 min walk from La Concha beach, and with bus 33 or 40 in 5 min there. The site is great and the price too. Thanks to the town hall for providing this type of areas for motorhomes."
6580,2415205,4,martinomega,01/10/2022,2 nights for 15e20. It is a car park with water and drainage. Not that bad. We slept very well. And ideal for visiting and enjoying the city. Great.
6580,2414188,5,Bullas,30/09/2022,"Excellent location for parking and servicing the AC in San Sebastian! Super quiet both during the day and at night. It is recommended to arrive in the morning because it fills up quickly. In season €7.60/24 hours is paid, and a stay can be added up to a maximum of 72 continuous hours. Walking you can reach Ondorraga beach in 10-15 minutes and, from there, a nice walk to Playa de la Concha!"
6580,2412728,4,ceciliadieste,30/09/2022,"We managed to get the last place left. The location is very good. We walked to the center of the city. Although it does not offer many services, it is compensated by the tranquility and the good location. We had a very quiet night."
6580,2412256,4,Lagalo,29/09/2022,"Very good place, small spaces but ideal to stay a couple of days to get to know the city. Bus that takes you to the center very accessible. We are from Argentina"
6580,2407598,4,HarryandDiane,27/09/2022,"Great location for walking into town. Arrived 20th September and were luck to get a spot this is a popular location. It is essentially a motorhome carpark with facilities dumping, grey/black, filling up with clean water no elec. On ticket machine, bottom right of screen allows you to change language and there is a delay, be patient. Cost was 7 Euro for 24 hours, being so close is was a bargain."
6580,2405521,3,star97,26/09/2022,This area has the merit of existing but is really not up to the city. Also not super clean (negligence of some) very little space. Abuse of some campicarists who use the services and leave! An arrangement is necessary.
6580,2400595,4,ChristelDobbelaere,24/09/2022,"Place visited on 06/09/22. Great camper place to visit the city, but we were there around 1 pm and everything was already fully booked! Found a place in a surrounding street together with many other campers and at a normal parking fee. On departure, made use of the disposal facilities of the motorhome without any problems."
6580,2399811,4,SpicyCampers,24/09/2022,"Great place, cycling distance from the beach and the city. In any case, cycling in this city is fun! In the morning around 11 o'clock there were always some places available. In the evening it is packed. Your best chance at a spot is definitely in the morning."
6580,2397802,1,jumpy04,23/09/2022,Archi Complete and shabby. But how to stay to visit the town…. It's complicated to find a place for the night and the day of visit.
6580,2380997,4,nyny53,17/09/2022,very good but little space. it is absolutely necessary to arrive in the morning and wait for the departures. otherwise streets in university possible by paying parking from 9am
6580,2377750,4,kalvidaniel,16/09/2022,"Good area, a lot of police come to control with camera car, area controlled by OTA"
6580,2372183,4,WanderVan22,14/09/2022,really lucky to get a spot in this busy city. they are narrow places but it does feel safe with all of us
6580,2365671,4,JuleHoff,12/09/2022,"Well located place, the beach is within walking distance. We were there in early September and by 3pm the place was already totally full. You stand very close. We then drove down the neighboring streets and were able to stand there parallel to the street. It was very noisy at night though."
6580,2362019,3,choricita,11/09/2022,we only stayed overnight but very quiet thanks
6580,2357801,4,furgobidaia,10/09/2022,The area was full but the services are free. You can park nearby and spend the night without any problem.
6580,2356955,4,juan.alborea,10/09/2022,It is good and very accessible by bike to visit the city. The somewhat shabby cleaning area.
6580,2351188,5,Keuler171,08/09/2022,Great place for a day or two to explore the city. It takes about 15 minutes by bus to get to the old town - the area is very quiet for a student district.
6580,2340339,4,niamhf97,05/09/2022,Perfect location with very frequent buses to San Sebastián just a short walk away. Felt very safe. €7.60 for 24 hours. Waste facilities are fine but could be better maintained.
6580,2335920,3,PeterHueber,03/09/2022,The pitch was completely full on September 3rd. But there are good parking spaces 100 meters away. The way to the old town is about 4 km far. We took a taxi on the way back and paid 10 euros for it.
6580,2332863,4,Vfns,02/09/2022,"Can fill water, empty black and gray water for free. We didn't stay there because it was full."
6580,2329001,1,OscarHevia,01/09/2022,"area with a total lack of maintenance, no control of unauthorized vehicles, the loading and unloading area is disgusting, I think everything needs an update, in the wooded area in the background there are some suspicious trails, in short, a total lack cleaning and control"
6580,2323831,1,davidbernal,31/08/2022,"one of the worst areas I've been in, by far impossible to park and everything is super compressed, while next to it there is a huge private parking lot that we can't enter at the end we have parked in the area of the faculty. We haven't paid either because nowhere does it explain how the colors work. luckily we have not been fined"
6580,2323410,5,windalo,31/08/2022,"A 10 for the City Council. A short walk from the Miramar Palace that separates the Ondarreta beach from La Concha. We were lucky because we arrived in the afternoon and got a seat. In the morning there is more rotation. 3 days maximum. A lot of police pass by and say nothing. A family that was sitting down was told not to leave their chairs outside when they finished. But a German took two places with an SUV and a caravan and they did not say anything, not even a VW Caddy without a campervan. The surrounding streets were full paying blue zone. There were also parked at the end of Ondarreta beach, near the funicular."
6580,2320931,5,mikelmsd,30/08/2022,Well located. 20 min walk to the beach. Very calm
6580,2302653,3,Makkes616,26/08/2022,Nothing should be left outside overnight. We had left our solar shower & an old stool outside as a step. A teenager with an e-scooter tried to steal both. There is always traffic at night. Overall ok for a city but nothing to relax.
6580,2299936,2,TRex4camp,25/08/2022,highly compressed area. AC/campers are close together in very little space. There was no room and finally we have not slept here and we have gone in front of the faculties that it is better. I think it's a better option than being there.
6580,2296574,2,eska81,24/08/2022,Incredibly small and packed as sardines.
6580,2294936,4,Fernandomi16,24/08/2022,"We arrived at 11 am and area full. We parked nearby in the blue zone and at 9:00 the guard woke us up to move the vehicle because we invaded part of the road (it is true that our AC is 7'3m but it was well parked), the guard was very kind with the recommendation (he recommended nearby areas) but if he saw us later in the same area he would fine us."
6580,2285485,3,LoesKockmann,22/08/2022,"Since it is the only motorhome spot in San Sebastian, it is completely full of motorhomes around here. Actual motorhome not reached, have taken a spot between dozens of other motorhomes on the street. Very quiet, great night and perfect location relative to the center. Very nice city for cycling (constructed bike paths!)"
6580,2276855,3,aclacigarralera,21/08/2022,"The area was full despite making 3 attempts to park we couldn't, the facilities to have so much demand are fair. Being close to the university in summer it has been easy to park and in the surrounding streets, we were many ac and Camper, if you set the time and don't take anything out onto the street no one bothers you. Quiet area to sleep."
6580,2271420,2,KaneloAntonio,20/08/2022,"It's a shame that a city like San Sebastián has such an uncomfortable area, small and dirty, loading and unloading is from the third world, any small town has a better area, it's one of the worst areas I've been to."
6580,2267300,3,olisamigo,19/08/2022,"We didn't sleep there, but did the oil changes and filled up with water, it helped us out a lot, even if it's not the best done. Well located in relation to downtown San Sebastian, easily accessible by bike. The area being full, we parked in the nearby parking spaces."
6580,2264686,4,mark81050,18/08/2022,"Small camper area, in peak periods you have to arrive before 10am. Loading and unloading not well maintained but working. At 500 meters there is a laundromat and on the first beach (Ondarreta) that you meet when arriving in the city there are hot and spotless showers for less than two euros. We got around by bike very well with two children, in 10 'you reach the beaches and in 20 in the center."
6580,2261046,4,ZumkellerF,18/08/2022,"Very popular place, but we found a place with a little patience. Nice area, buses to the center 300 meters."
6580,2258350,3,paolopicarella,17/08/2022,"Great price 3.50 for a day a bit far from the center, many, Perfect for those with autonomous means"
6580,2255620,4,giannis114,17/08/2022,Great location to visit on foot San Sebastian.  With bicycles it is even better as the whole city has good infrastructure for it. The problem is that you don't find a place easily and that the water supply has no standard connector and you need to press it all the time.  If you don't find a place there you can park on the streets outside. They are full of Campers.
6580,2252297,4,Josari,16/08/2022,The Area is good to take a place you have to arrive early. I give it 4 stars because it takes a long time to fill the water. Well connected with the 5 or 25 takes you to the historic center
6580,2252062,3,CCfred,16/08/2022,"we were lucky to find a place without problems but it seems difficult. 7.60 for 24 hours. we did not use the services but it smelled bad and of poor quality, complicated to maneuver there. all the cc's in town come empty and fill, traffic jam. the police are making rounds, nothing can come out. quiet and safe place"
6580,2250716,2,dede738,16/08/2022,"we came early around 10:30am, lots of people, we were lucky to get a seat. small location without permission to leave table chairs etc .... the police are running. bad smell coming from the drain area. very little shade. on the other hand the people are nice, nice encounters. and practical because 20 minutes from the beach."
6580,2250395,1,Nooz77,16/08/2022,"a disaster that is also very poorly designed for emptying gray water, toilets and filling clean water"
6580,2240006,4,Mic_past,15/08/2022,"Great location, few places (you have to arrive before 10.30). a lot of queues for loading and unloading. Bad maintenance. Quiet night"
6580,2238233,2,Akuna,14/08/2022,"Pros: very close to the center (20 minutes walk to the beach and 1 minute to the bus so you don't have to walk if you prefer- line 33. Line 40 can also be taken a little further). Cons: a scam pay €8 for this place. There is no maintenance of the emptying and filling area. Broken faucets, drains too. Very bad smells. Clean water comes out very slowly and with a push button. It sucks to empty and fill. Queues of more than 2 hours (rows of motorhomes in queue every day) to use emptying and filling."
6580,2237370,3,perichs,14/08/2022,"the area has been open for many years, and there are many ac that go to san sebastian, it is very small, it would not be bad if they made it bigger so as not to bother us. You take the bus on Av de Tolosa and it takes you to the center, it's great. In any case, thanks to the city council for not fining, at least in the big week we have really enjoyed the great city that is San Sebastián. Thank you"
6580,2236056,3,Joserra73.,14/08/2022,Small area for the large influx of AC. It is a pity that the parking lot that is right next to this area is not used. Carry small adapters for the water intake. Well connected by bus and bike to the center and beach
6580,2235307,4,marcangouleme,14/08/2022,"Ideally located for visiting the city with bus 5. On the other hand, only one tap with a very slow flow, allow a little time. On the other hand, if you park in the car park outside the zone, beware of the blue line, if you go over it is 135 euros, many are trapped."
6580,2229960,4,nunetta91,13/08/2022,"Area well connected by bike or by bus to the center and the beaches, on foot approx. 35 min. Few seats for the great arrival of AC. We arrived mid-morning and found 1 place. Slow water filling service, long queues. The police pass by the area a couple of times a day. It only allows you 3 nights overnight. €7.60/24h.a good area to visit the city although small"
6580,2226151,4,Chete11,12/08/2022,"Good area to spend the night, it was full and we parked in the blue zone on the university campus without any problem. It was all full of AC and vans. Have a drink on Matías street on the way to La Concha, which is about a 35-minute walk. Walk that gets along well because you go bordering the beaches and enjoying the landscape."
6580,2220042,4,VHS,12/08/2022,Good place to stay overnight. Almost always full. A little far from the center but probably the best place to stay overnight in San Sebastian. Gray and black water dumps available on site.
6580,2219010,4,sunn40,11/08/2022,"Very good for visiting the city, in high season arrive between 9am and 11am to be sure of having a place. Limited to 72h"
6580,2216390,1,Abuelaodu,11/08/2022,"Very small place considering the thousands of motorhomes looking for parking and water services in the surrounding streets. It has a paved esplanade next to it closed by blocks so that you can enter. A city as beautiful as San Sebastián and so visited deserves to have several spacious car parks with services, it would save having all the streets full of motorhomes"
6580,2214312,1,m4ri4,11/08/2022,"It is very dirty, the water sources are half broken, only one emptying and filling point for all the AC, there are long queues, and on top of that you pay. I don't recommend it, although there isn't a good alternative in town I think."
6580,2212638,5,riftertouring,10/08/2022,"Contrary to other comments, I would recommend trying your luck later in the day. We got a seat in the afternoon because someone was driving away. The location is great as the town and the beach are within walking distance. There is a beach shower on the beach."
6580,2212125,4,olivier.samson,10/08/2022,does a ridiculous service for a city like San Sebastian but has the merit of allowing you to drain and fill with water. there are plenty of parking places nearby to catch the 5 or 25 bus to visit San Sebastian.

There is a good walk to the old town, when we go with a dog, we want to stretch our legs. At 500 m there is a place to wash clothes. In the mornings the garbage truck passes by waking up every living being."

The area in which it is located is far from the beach and the center, but you can get there quickly by bike, and there is public transport because it is the university area. 4 stars because it is great to have this option within a city like San Sebastián ."
6580,2082877,3,Tyden,17/07/2022,"Fair area in the squares, there is a queue to fill and empty, very nice surroundings, and a great location well connected by bus. Few Places, you pay right there in a time machine. No more than 72 hours"

But in general it is a very comfortable area and it is worth it. The only thing, that it has a lot of rotation and is always full. The city is too small!"
6580,2003768,4,GooseandSwan,23/06/2022,40min walk into Centro/Old Town but a pleasant walk along beachfront promenade. 15min walk to beach. Recommend getting there early to ensure you get a spot as it gets busy early. Tight spaces with Waste dump and water refill.
6580,1995431,4,Mike_wood,20/06/2022,"Great spot, easy to get into San Sebastián by bus 5 or 25, or cycle along a good cycle lane or walk (approx 1 hour to old town). We paid 21 euros for 3 days. Water and waste disposal only, no electric. Spaces are a little tight and fairly noisy with people arriving and leaving as it is a busy spot. We arrived 10am to get a space and there were only a left. People seemed to park in nearby areas to."
6580,1988853,3,anderecke,18/06/2022,"We arrived late and there was no room. We slept in the surroundings, which is the university area with limited parking (after 9 you have to pay). So we spent a quiet night and elsewhere."

6580,1972493,5,Atbury,13/06/2022,Good spot in the university area for visiting San Sebastian but spaces may go quickly. Some parking in nearby streets but I don't know if that is allowed. Number 5 or 33 nus into the old town. Good view from the funicular. Would stay here again.
6580,1967776,3,reisefreak1,11/06/2022,"We stood at the entrance for 1 1/2 hours late this morning, unfortunately no space became available. We then drove on to Biarritz. Too bad."
6580,1967593,3,Aussie12,11/06/2022,Nothing special except a piece of land to park close to the city. Quite a walk to the old town (absolute must do) but there are buses around. Parking meter is a bit of a pain but can be worked out with trial and error.
6580,1965631,2,NuggetKatie,10/06/2022,"When we arrived there was no space left, we had to stand on the edge. Parking ticket machine was broken, but then worked again relatively quickly. The places are very tight. Water connection available, but without a thread and therefore not usable for us. Price in the high season with more than 6 € quite expensive. City within walking distance, toilets in the university building."
6580,1963136,4,saramarti,10/06/2022,"Super quiet area, clean and well maintained. It's about a 40 minute walk to the center. I don't give it 5 stars because it doesn't have electricity. It is recommended to arrive in the morning or noon to find a place."
6580,1954703,5,marion.zuko,07/06/2022,"Very nice place, 7€60 for 24 hours with services, we feel completely safe there, we arrived at 12:15 p.m. and there was one place left, 30 min later another place became free, that is to say that here we respect the authorized parking time, so there is regularly a space that becomes available. Close to the square and the beautiful city center."
6580,1950792,5,KayleighConway,06/06/2022,"A great place to stay when visiting San Sebastián.. only 7.60 a night, a great price for what is offered!

6580,1950739,5,Bo2022,05/06/2022,"For the price you pay, it’s more than 5 star. It’s out the way, feels safe, is a nice enough place to stay for a night or two, especially for the price. To the people giving bad reviews because it’s full when you arrive, that doesn’t really make sense, especially at less than 10 euros a night. And complaining because the cleaners come early, but then also complaining because it’s not clean. Maybe camper life isn’t meant for you."
6580,1949924,5,bawzon,05/06/2022,Very quiet place. 7.60€ per night but good location and frequent police patrol. Only bad side for us was that it’s maximum 3 days. Come early because the place was full everywhere by 4pm

6580,1947701,5,aileen108,05/06/2022,Perfect spot to explore San Sebastián. We stayed three nights and took the number 5 bus into the city everyday. Only €3.30 per night with good water and drainage services. Would recommend to arrive between 10am - 12pm when people are starting to leave so you get a spot!
6580,1940571,5,Iva11,02/06/2022,"A council owned paid parking lot especially for campers/motorhomes - far enough from the street to be quiet for sleeping, like minded people around, water facilities and place for emptying waters/toilets. It always gets full so as the rest of the people said - come here earlier. We grabbed the last spot at 6.30pm."
6580,1939696,4,Saereah,02/06/2022,"Not a particularly pretty spot, but great for an overnight stay or two when touring the city. Quiet and lit all night. The place is very busy and always full in the evenings."
6580,1939291,2,jboyle,02/06/2022,Small pitches and very busy.  Constant smell of human faeces from the 20 camper vans that released their effluent into the open drain. Average.
6580,1937849,4,Andrea-Dinis,01/06/2022,"The area is very good, it is very quiet although quite small for the number of cars waiting to enter. The parking meter was broken, they had to call to pass the incidence. Free emptying and filling, without restricted or paid access. The emptying area is located in a passage area. It is far enough from the center to walk to the ""old part"" area for almost an hour."
6580,1935463,3,zachariah273,31/05/2022,Good place to visit San Sebastián. Essentially a car park with water and CC facilities. No toilets nearby.

A lot of people were having trouble with the ticket machine being in Basque but I noticed on our third day that if you click on the pink square marked ""Catalan"" it will cycle through other languages, French and English included. The machine takes card or exact change."
6580,1923442,4,Delfin99,28/05/2022,"Very nice spot close to the town, 30 minute walk or a quick bus ride with a very good connection from the parkingspot. We had the inconvenience that we stayed next to a couple with 2 little children so it was a bit noisy but it was a great spot afterall"
6580,1921089,3,Mmmoustic,27/05/2022,"We are tight on this area! Quiet night. Close to beaches where dogs can run between October 1 and May 31 (turismocanino.es). Near the Idelguo funicular. To find a place, it is better to come early. To adjust, French is available in the interface of the machine."

Cramped car park but does the job.
and only about 7 euros for 2 nights.
Water on tap. waste and toilet empty point present.
A long way from the old town but still walkable along the prominade or beach.
The pay machine was a pain with, i think , Catalan as its only language.
It took a French, Swiss, Spanish, Scots working group to figure it out."
6580,1897675,5,CINZIAontheROAD,18/05/2022,Everything is perfect with flat seats very close to each other… € 3.30 per night with a convenient and simple parking column. Ok coins and credit cards. Baskets and excellent loading and unloading area. In 15 minutes by bike you are in town. For us an excellent solution with partially shaded parking. The police come by often and make everything very quiet.

about a 45 minutes walk into town. worth the walk as you go by a bunch of local restaurants and is safer than in the centre of the city."
6580,1884646,5,NJM,12/05/2022,Motorhome area located 3 km from the magnificent bay of San Sebastian. The area could be much larger. The bar opposite sells bread and Viennese pastries. I recommend.

6580,1869585,5,RamS.,04/05/2022,"Great place to explore the city for 1 or 2 days. We felt safe and comfortable. The payment machine is a bit stubborn if you don't speak Spanish. When entering the car, press the blue button below and you can enter it manually. And of course you stand van to van and have little space, but that should be logical for all complainers with such a place for 3.30 €/24h! Thank you city"
6580,1869484,4,rimoruben,04/05/2022,"The site could be improved or made a bigger one, there are many of us in this world and we almost always stay out of more than half to visit San Sebastián, it goes well since you can walk along the beach."

6580,1868840,3,davidkoeln,03/05/2022,"the place is completely ok. Now in April you can also get a parking space if you don't come too late in the evening. Supply / disposal included in the price of €3.30. That's super cheap. You can quickly get to the city or the beach by bike or on foot. It's quiet, and I think the slope of the place is negligible - didn't bother me."
6580,1864973,5,AlejandroAlayo,02/05/2022,perfect. 3.30 24 hours and clean water filling and gray emptying service. 15 minutes walk from Ondarreta beach and bus 25 leaves you in the very old center of San Sebastián. Tranquility and security. The police pass many times even at night. Perfect to enjoy this beautiful city.
6580,1863041,4,MCarnaval,01/05/2022,"Parking is full but very convenient, plus the great price. The cc are very close to each other, but if people have respect for each other there is no problem. The place is silent. At the payment toten, pay attention when you appear to place the license plate. There is an item below for foreign vehicles."
6580,1860480,4,Schingue,29/04/2022,"Quiet, enough spaces just to park, you pay but everything is close (bar, market, locomotion), student neighborhood. On high demand. It would be perfect With power outlet."

6580,1850408,4,ParkStar,24/04/2022,Stay and water service for a very affordable price. Very good communication to visit a city that is a jewel. Thanks to the City Council for this service to motorhomes
6580,1850368,4,TheGroody,24/04/2022,Stayed a couple of nights. Easy access to cycle paths straight down to the promenade. The site has no facilities but for 3.30 you can’t argue.
6580,1850253,4,TeamAulala,24/04/2022,"parking well located, convenient to reach the center, promenade, beach by transport or by bike. Pity noise in the morning due to cleaning machines. some shops nearby. Very affordable price."
6580,1846830,3,roadtrip3003,22/04/2022,"Parking definitely serves its purpose for one night. We paid €3.30 for 24 hours. Was able to drain gray and black water and fill up with new water. Police drove patrol, we felt safe. Unfortunately, the place is not level and quickly occupied. In addition, a sweeper drove between 05:30 and 06:00 directly on the square (very loud). Therefore only 3 stars"
6580,1846238,1,suzhayes,22/04/2022,Didn’t stay as much too busy. No more than a car park surrounded by high rise apartments. Will give San Sebastián a miss. Much better places up in the hills.
6580,1844083,4,Quim-Gisela,21/04/2022,Good. €3.30 per 24h. Filled and emptied. Very correct. There is a walk to the center of about 30m. Better go in the morning. There is more movement. In the afternoon difficult to find.
6580,1840806,4,popajoel,20/04/2022,"3.30 for 24 hours, perfect, you still have to negotiate with the paying robot!! In our time ?? Nothing but Spanish. !! Space in April and no risk of getting bogged down with this Breton rain. Thank you st sebastien for this rare step. To connect the historic center by bus, line 5 or 25, be careful to memorize your destination, too many ads on the bus screen"
6580,1836642,4,laiafu,18/04/2022,"2km from Ondarreta beach, near La Concha beach. Very easy to visit San Sebastian. price €3.3 24h in low season. (Few places, difficult to find a place, but it is a university area and there are many battery parking lots around."
6580,1832118,5,ifgg,17/04/2022,The area is provided with water and emptied of grays and blacks. There are not many places but it is located in the university area and there is a lot of parking area to park and spend the night without problem. Well connected to the center with lines 5 and 25. Highly recommended.
6580,1831105,5,EdGer,17/04/2022,"A great parking space in the middle of the city. Almost 3 km on foot, by bike or bus (numbers 5 and 25 for EUR 3.70 there and back. According to the bus driver, dogs are only allowed if they can be taken on the lap). Long mobile homes have problems maneuvering. Experienced 2 collisions in the two days."
6580,1827489,5,jorge23,16/04/2022,One of the few places that is so calm and comfortable having everything nearby. I recommend it 100% !!! The whole installation is great. That if maximum 72 hours!
6580,1819808,4,VanDell,13/04/2022,"Being near the old town for a few euros with supply and disposal is great. There's one thing to remember: you're not paying for the night, you're paying for 24 hours. That means not everyone leaves in the morning. By 12 noon everything was full. I waited a bit and half an hour later I was able to get a seat. That's how people come and go all day. Worth the wait!"

6580,1811193,4,ourworldheritage,08/04/2022,"Handy motorhome to visit the city. The places are small and it is not cozy, but because you are quickly on foot in the city or at the beach, this place is highly recommended!"
6580,1810848,5,Polla91,08/04/2022,We slept here one night. Very quiet and safe. The city center is only a 10-minute walk away. Great for a stroll along the seafront. I recommend arriving early as it is very popular. Drinking water filling and gray and black water discharge. Recommended
6580,1809730,4,tobiandlaura,07/04/2022,"Unfortunately, it is the only permitted parking space for the city, it's not nice at the moment, but for €3.30 with water you can't complain. The places are completely full in the evening, so it is better to arrive in the morning/mid-morning."
6580,1807561,5,ourvanadventuresuk,05/04/2022,Great location - get the no25 or 5 bus into town or 20-30 minute walk along the beaches to the old town! Best to arrive early/late morning to get a spot.  It’s regularly patrolled by transport police so make sure you get a ticket as soon as you arrive!
6580,1806689,5,mudakonn,05/04/2022,Secure place in the city. Buying tickets was not possible as the machine didn’t work properly.
6580,1800580,4,sciroco,30/03/2022,"Well located, visit of the beautiful city on foot possible or bus nearby. On the other hand, it is preferable to arrive in the morning to find a place. Service area that needs updating but usable."
6580,1794015,4,Gabrielmv,24/03/2022,"Hello good. Is it possible to reserve the place, or is it on a first-come, first-served basis? Thanks"
6580,1792886,5,velabianca,23/03/2022,Good place to visit the city it deserves. I recommend arriving before 10 / 10.30 otherwise sold out. Not far away bus n. 5 or 25 boulevard stop for city center.
6580,1787137,2,Dume,18/03/2022,"Good place to stand cheaply and visit the city. A lot of stench from the discharge site, which is half hygienic. We chose another place to stay overnight."
6580,1786859,3,sergicanadell,18/03/2022,"The aera is not bad, we miss being able to plug in. In summer it is always super crowded. It has to empty gray and black water and fill water. It is far from the center but there are bus stops nearby Thanks to layutamiento."
6580,1785558,4,Etrusco53,17/03/2022,"Very well centrally located. Old town, beach and restaurants within easy walking and cycling distance. Bus stop right on the square. V/E ok. Place is always well attended. Full on the weekend. Used by many as a transit stop. Costs of €3.30/night absolutely ok Garbage is often emptied. Guardia Civil patrols here in the morning and in the evening. You feel safe."
6580,1780471,4,Pableras7,11/03/2022,"Very well located, very well connected with buses to the center, bike path to the beach, pity that it is small, necessary/essential to improve, please, the water taps."
6580,1779751,2,hogler,11/03/2022,"Addendum: ... and THANK YOU to the city cleaning service, which at 7:25 a.m. extensively cleaned the paths between the parked mobile homes with a sweeper for the first time, and 2 hours later??? cleaned again. You can't ignore the welcome garbage disposal every day at around 8:00 a.m. Otherwise I would have overslept."
6580,1779132,4,lianaelmans,10/03/2022,Good parking spot for a fair price considering the location. Take only few stops with the bus to go to the city center. Although it’s also a nice walk. Already quite full with campers even though in low season.
6580,1778377,3,hogler,09/03/2022,"At 4:30 p.m. we got the penultimate pitch despite the rain. The machine is a bit cumbersome and can't speak English!!!! With the third variant, he finally issued the parking ticket for 72 hours and debited it correctly from the card ;-)) DOES IT WORK?"
6580,1771645,4,RensvanLoon,02/03/2022,"Good place to visit from San Sebastian from there. Bus stop in turn (3 min), line 40 to the old town. Camper place is € 3.30 per night. Water. gray water drain and toilet available. It is also possible to pay with a credit card at the machine."
6580,1766872,4,gongovan,26/02/2022,"We spent one night on Feb 22, good price (3.30 eur). It was just passing through and we couldn't check the communication of public transport with the city center, but the area has good access and is very quiet. It has water filling service and water emptying service."
6580,1765978,4,ErikAya,25/02/2022,"Well located site, good bus communication, almost always full. Too bad there are people who occupy two sites for a motorhome, but without counting the incivility of the people, the site is great."
6580,1765739,5,bettyboop29700,25/02/2022,thank you to the city of San Sebastián for its air of camping car. well located near the city for only 3.30 € for 24 hours with services except electricity. Quiet night. buses nearby

6580,1756723,4,Gopvan,15/02/2022,"AC very well located. It is located in a university area, a little far from the center, which did not mean any problem for us. Our option was to rent bicycles, so you were in the center of San Sebastian in no time. The price (€3.30) is unbeatable and the services are fine."
6580,1751431,5,sebastien5688,09/02/2022,"We stayed there for 2 nights. Slept well, quiet night. Water and drainage. Buses nearby!"
6580,1751082,4,dref59,09/02/2022,"I wouldn't call it a car park anymore, but it's all there, nothing more to spend a quiet night. Attention the terminal is capricious, at the bottom of the screen on the right you can choose the French language, that will help you. And of course a big thank you to the mayor of the municipality because the price is reasonable, the other municipalities should take examples because they all take us for cash cows"
6580,1750262,5,Millaneando,07/02/2022,"We arrived on Saturday afternoon and we almost didn't get a seat, but one left and we stayed the weekend and everything was great, super quiet."
6580,1743746,4,plukkieb,29/01/2022,"Spent a total of 2 nights in SB; 1st night on the boulevard (top spot but max 24 hours) and 2nd night at this cp. CP is okay. It is a parking lot with facilities, no more than that. It was super busy when we were there! Incidentally, no noise pollution and had a good night."
6580,1741140,4,DeReizigers,25/01/2022,"Great place with working facilities (winter period). Quiet. Slept one night, then drove to the parking lot at the old town. We found that more relaxed because you are closer to the nice part of the city."

Absolutely recommended to visit Donosti. Thank you Donosti City Council !!!"
6580,1737086,4,ROfford,19/01/2022,Quiet location next to university.   20 min walk to beach.  Grey and black waste.    Low cost and well worth it for easy access to town.

A 20 min walk to the first beach. Many bus connections (pets are allowed), in 8 min you get to the center on different lines. A wise place."
6580,1732581,5,TJTHORLEY77,12/01/2022,"Nice park up, slightly sloped in places. very safe, police patrol through every hour. about 30mins walk to beach 45mins to old town. easy bike path all the way. ticket machine confuses people, however, the pink button on bottom right of screen changes language keep going until you find yours and then change license plate from E to foreign if not spanish. services clean and free."
6580,1724569,4,sandrido,03/01/2022,Spent 2 peaceful nights in this municipal rest area. During this period it costs € 3.30 / 24h. Loading and unloading possible. No electricity. Several campers present. Bicycles are recommended to reach the center and the beaches of San Sebastian.

Quite bright in the night due to many lights. 20 minutes walk to the beach and nice cafe etna and burger place within 5 minutes. Tip: If there’s no place available: wait for 10 minutes. There are always people leaving the spot - also at night.
6580,1719254,4,marobeca,29/12/2021,"Air well placed for visiting the city (30 minutes walk) where there are buses. On the other hand, a lot of people, we got the last place when we arrived at the beginning of the harsh noon…"
6580,1718968,5,Trav3ll3r,29/12/2021,Very close to the city. All the services. Quiet. In low season 3.30 euros. Worth.

6580,1716820,4,Rick.,27/12/2021,Great place to stay overnight. Even now it was crowded with RVs. We couldn't find a toilet. Pay at the machine for a maximum of 3 days.
6580,1716460,5,lruiz,27/12/2021,a very calm and well located area. calm night. Service included in the price.

Agur"
6580,1705218,4,Campaneros,07/12/2021,"The area is very good. Quiet and well located. The water filling and cleaning area leaves a little to be desired, the taps are bad and the nozzle is small."
6580,1703455,4,Lunatica66,05/12/2021,"Parking area 24 hours € 3.30, in a straight line you go down to the great promenade at the edge of the sea, very crowded, to object a little short and narrow places for those of us who have AC of 7.50. Thanks San Sebastián for remembering a bit about the motorhomes"
6580,1702778,5,adam12813,04/12/2021,"Absolute bargain, 3,30€ for 24h. We parked here and walked into the town which took us about 40 minutes. It’s a lovely walk to the beach and then along the promenade to the centre. The area is safe with lots of motorhomes present, has a good service area and water tap. Would recommend purely for the price and quietness! There’s a bus you can take to the city but the walk was great. Would recommend"
6580,1688848,5,celhine,14/11/2021,A cheap camping area. Very easy access by bus to the city center. The little less: we are quite close to each other
6580,1687667,4,Van33SMJ,13/11/2021,"Very well located and inexpensive. To pay, the terminal is a little capricious, remember to change the language by selecting the box at the bottom right of the home screen."
6580,1686602,3,MargotvSvA,12/11/2021,"Simple car park with facilities as indicated. Be on time, because it is often full by the end of the afternoon, especially on weekends. You can easily reach the center by bike, on foot or by bus."
6580,1685297,2,Descoust,11/11/2021,"We parked but unable to use the terminal to pay, the control vehicle passing regularly we preferred to leave"
6580,1684575,4,Karlia,10/11/2021,"Good inexpensive place with a somewhat annoying parking ticket machine - ideally insert the exact amount. And it's best to back up onto the wedge, otherwise it could get complicated because of someone standing behind you."
6580,1684320,4,BiMo58,10/11/2021,"Very centrally located the place to reach the beautiful beach promenade on foot! The place is very clean and with V + E, garbage can and lighting for € 3.30 absolutely OK! However, the WOMO's are very narrow and the maximum is reached at a length of 8.00 m!"
6580,1683410,4,444Ac777,09/11/2021,"Super well placed and quiet, ideal for visiting San Sebastian by bus 5 or 25. Just lack of electricity. Reasonable price. thanks to the city for this place. to recommend"
6580,1681185,5,vwT42021,07/11/2021,We go here every year for 1 or 2 nights. San Sebastián is awesome and this is a great place to sleep while discovering the city. Thanks!
6580,1681161,3,Alanouille,07/11/2021,"Finally a normal place where there is water that you can take! You just need an adapter with a thief plug, or a small screw-in tip. For the night it is paying, but the services are free: gray water, black water and drain. We didn't stay overnight, but the place looks “normal”."
6580,1680086,4,ivoderooij,06/11/2021,Good camper place for visit after the city. not very spacious but it has everything you need in itself.
6580,1678078,3,MarioFdz,04/11/2021,"When we arrived it was full and around the motorhome area there were a few of us who did not have parking, it would be nice if they could expand it."
6580,1674881,4,saisai32,02/11/2021,"Very good motorhome area. The place is quiet and many bus lines pass nearby to reach the city center of San Sebastián. Water point for gray water emptying and accessible toilets. No electricity. Not expensive at all. Few places but it is normal that it is so popular, it is very practical and secure"
6580,1674736,4,FabienVeder,02/11/2021,"Well placed and quiet area in a university district, easy access to the city center by bus 5 or 25, small but inexpensive pitches"
6580,1673278,4,Chris64240,01/11/2021,Area very well placed to visit the city as well as to go to the beach. No electricity but at this price it is normal beware the parking lot fills up quickly we stayed 3 night and it was rather quiet
6580,1671419,5,mlz86,31/10/2021,"Very quiet parking area set back from the street and green environment. Close to the university district. Quick and easy access to the city center and the beach by bus line 5. Defective water tap that leaks a lot, no electrical connection ... but at this price, it's still very recommendable"
6580,1666123,4,jjn76,28/10/2021,"We spent a quiet night there with our 7 meter CC because the area for CC one km lower was full. Room for 3/4 CC. Almost flat parking. Good plan. Only negative point, this small car park is hidden from view, so a little doubt to leave the CC unattended during the day ..... but without valid reason, because the district seems residential without problem of insecurity."
6580,1664713,5,renatavan,27/10/2021,"We spent 2 quiet nights here (€3.30/day). Great location on the outskirts of San Sebastián, but it has good bus connection to the city and the beach. We were lucky to find one of the last available places, so arrive sooner than later and have a backup plan in case :) facilities are nice. Recommended and would come back"
6580,1662913,3,thibetrem,26/10/2021,Area very well placed to visit the city as well as to go to the beach. We used the bikes and filled up with water. We didn't spend the night but I think there is little noise
6580,1662301,3,pticlod,25/10/2021,"It's convenient to town if you have a bike. The price is very correct. the pitches a bit narrow. The behavior of some shows the lack of respect they have for those around them. do not hesitate to point out to them. even if they are of another nationality, Google translate will help you make yourself understood. always with a smile but firmly."
6580,1660928,4,JensEckert,24/10/2021,Were there on a weekend at the end of October and the place was always full. Would be nice if San Sebastian would expand the motorhome parking space. The mobile homes that can no longer find space are placed in the streets near the parking space because you still have the opportunity to dispose of and fill up with water.
6580,1657423,4,marpaufel,22/10/2021,"Good area. The squares are very fair, but it is what it is. Remember that it is only for motorhomes. We saw a caravan and a car occupying two seats. They are fair and a cheek appears on top."
6580,1653656,3,cagoufff,20/10/2021,"Only existing parking air. It is cheap. Ideally placed for a city tour. Gentlemen, at midnight you refuel, switch off your engine! At 1am it is not time to put away your motorhome! Let us know how to live between us"
6580,1652523,3,cinrichifurgo,19/10/2021,"The area is very well located, but since it is very small, we arrived in the afternoon and there was no room. We parked in a nearby street on the university campus, since it was a weekend we were calm, the local police passed by on several occasions and did not complain."
6580,1646004,4,LULUGIR,15/10/2021,"Very well-kept area, for 3.30 euros you park and it is very close to the center, walking about 20-30 minutes. You pay as in a blue zone, in a machine that gives a ticket and you put your license plate"
6580,1645143,4,Aliced35,15/10/2021,We arrived at 12 noon with our van and we took the last seat! The price is very interesting 3.3 € for 24 hours. 15mn walk from the beach but far enough from the historic center (50mn). Buses do not pass less to go there. nothing charming about this location but convenient and secure!
6580,1640846,3,MarcosC,12/10/2021,"Too small for a city with San Sebastián, although very quiet to sleep. It is well connected, 15 minutes walk to Ondarreta beach and 25 to the center, bus available. It is recommended to use a bike, there are many places to leave it (with your chain or lock) or use the electric bicycle system of the DBizi.eus city council"
6580,1638636,3,Jutin2122,11/10/2021,"Good starting point for exploring San Seb. Since many campers empty here, there is a slightly unpleasant smell over some of the pitches. It's tight and you have to be lucky to get a seat."
6580,1638192,3,roseroma,11/10/2021,"Very good location but very small, We arrived early to ensure a place. If you arrive and there are options, stay away from the water discharge area, as the smell is horrible. Perfect location to go by bus to the center."
6580,1637385,5,TafoGadafo,10/10/2021,"Great municipal area very well located. You can go to the beach and downtown taking a walk or by public transport, well connected. Very quiet nights. It is not very big and it is quite requested, we were lucky to get a place. Maximum stay of 72h, in low season € 3.30 / day. Highly recommended."
6580,1634161,4,Pastorcinnn,09/10/2021,"Very good area, thanks to the City Council for thinking about the motorhomes, 15 minutes from the beach and 40 from the historic center, bus stop very close, I do not give it five stars for the water filling tap that is ruined and because it there is no space in the area, it is always full and it stays small"
6580,1633010,4,plantefebre,08/10/2021,Super popular parking town and beach within 3 km for bikes it's extra thank you to the city of San Sebastian I recommend
6580,1632638,4,crisrod,08/10/2021,We have been at the beginning of October and it is perfect to spend the night and to go walking towards the center or by bike since it has a path of approximately 3 km but it is very pleasant since half of it runs along the wall of the Beach. the only downside that can be put to the area is that it lacks a little lighting and that perhaps in high season it is complete.
6580,1626690,5,franciscostoffel,04/10/2021,"Very nice space. We didn’t have a space because we arrived at midnight. The following day we arrived at 11 am and found a spot. 3.30€ for 24 hours in a very clean, calm and safe space. Maintenance is very easy to do. Absolutely 5*, it’s just a shame that there aren’t more parking spaces as it is the only proper space to park in San Sebastián."
6580,1622014,4,viajandogeral,02/10/2021,"Traveling general been here. good service area, few parking spaces and a little far from the center. but we had a quiet and safe night there. I recommend the city is beautiful"
6580,1621228,5,wooomooo,02/10/2021,Had a very good and quiet night. Great connection with the bus. I think the rating after me with one star is stupid. How can you give a star just because the parking space is full? It has nothing to do with space and can be the same anywhere.
6580,1620822,1,sorinp,01/10/2021,One star only because at 14.45 was full.
6580,1616784,4,happyflo,29/09/2021,"Great safe area to visit San Sebastián, at a good price for services, the night was very quiet, and contrary to what was indicated in the previous comment we had mostly motorhomes with southern European license plates with impeccable behavior."
6580,1616582,3,SCORE64,29/09/2021,It is not a CC area but a parking lot to park your vehicle. The city has made this place available to motorhome operators to visit the beautiful city of Sa Sébastien. Well located and well served by buses. It is better to arrive before noon to be sure to have a place. Quiet night anyway because the clientele is mainly northern European and English and disciplined.
6580,1615334,4,tokiocora,28/09/2021,"The only really practical place for a motorhome, the police turn a bit to check that you have paid there were a lot of people"
6580,1612145,4,JhonPancorbo,27/09/2021,"At 7'50 a day, there were many cars, the area practically completely flat, I recommend arriving early, there are buses that take you to La Concha beach, 5 and 25, there is also a cafeteria next door and a large parking lot. cars. We saw cars parked in Zona Azul next to the parking lot."
6580,1607393,4,danmccabe102,25/09/2021,"Extremely busy stop, we only managed to get a space as someone was pulling out. It seemed slightly quieter around 9-10am. Police did the rounds at 8pm so it is secure. Fresh water and disposal point, 40ish minute walk to the bay. €7.60 for the night, cheaper rate from october i think."
6580,1599597,2,Mireia6,22/09/2021,"It is a good place but we have arrived for 11am and it was all full. There were many motorhomes that had already been there for days. They should not leave parking for more than 48 hours, but those of us who arrive do not have the opportunity to see the city."
6580,1597040,4,Anamallegue,21/09/2021,"Excellent location, both to see the city by bike or on foot. Quiet, although a very small area for the size of the city of Donostia."

6580,1589016,5,damac,18/09/2021,"Very correct area in terms of coating, space, calm and price (less than 8 € for 24 hours, oil changes and recharging included). The old town is 3 km away on foot, following the beautiful beach."
6580,1585188,3,domigranier,17/09/2021,"An ideal area for visiting the city with its nearby bus line. The places are cramped and we are not allowed to take out tables, chairs, otherwise beware of fines. People from the south"
6580,1575725,3,puddyirl67,13/09/2021,Beautiful city well worth visiting. this place is a good location in university area. well connected by bus to main boulevard no5 & 25. small dogs allowed on bus. we got here at 2pm on Sunday & got a spot. Van's moving in & out from early but usually full by 3pm. it was very quiet at night. no electricity and water service area badly needs upgrading. no problem with ticket machine. spaces narrow
6580,1569677,1,trenkakames,11/09/2021,"Good grief, third world services, we pay a ticket for 48 hours and we are fined for desserts. We have to go on Saturday afternoon because they have parked two undesirables next door and let's party with the joint. Mother to fine and charge if they hurry now to give a dignified service? I don't understand how a city like San Sebastián has something so shabby, you go out and find cars everywhere."
6580,1567816,4,Gillesdudoubs,11/09/2021,"Area with drains and water. No electricity. It is prudent to arrive before noon to have a place. flat grass pitches but not very wide. Be careful with the payment terminal, it is impossible to take 48 hours without being billed for 72 hours, so it is preferable to pay in increments of 24 hours. Capricious cash payment, at least today so provide a card."
6580,1560172,1,epujolar,08/09/2021,"€ 90 fine, we parked, paying and do not put it on the poster but it is exclusive for motorhomes, fine to all vans then if you look for the regulations there if it puts it."
6580,1558133,3,ericfm,08/09/2021,"The area is well located, close to bus stops and not far from the beach. It has few places to park and you have to be there quite early to find them (between two quarters of nine and 10). The services lack a bit of maintenance."
6580,1546840,1,aps3,04/09/2021,"always full area. We decided to park in the surrounding streets like the rest of the cars, after consulting the Town Hall staff and saying yes. The next day, we had a fine because supposedly it was not possible to park like that, for occupying part of the sidewalk with the part behind, still leaving space on the sidewalk. I honestly think they are spoiling tourism in the city. I am not coming back."
6580,1538772,5,Dondeelvientonoslleve,01/09/2021,"First of all, thank the San Sebastián City Council for this area. Despite being small, you can usually find a place, if you wait a bit, since people usually come and go daily. the best thing is how close it is, to everything. If you take a bike, 5 min from the beach, and the La Concha promenade, along a large bike path, which runs through, the city is beautiful and great. the bus is next door."
6580,1536742,4,triguerovilanova,01/09/2021,"quiet area being away from the center. bike path to the beach or the old town very useful. difficult to find a free place, always full. free emptying and filling."
6580,1532317,2,borjaymaria811,30/08/2021,"Laughter area, small, narrow, lucky to park, we have had it. walking from the center very far if you go by bike in 10 minutes on the beach by bike path, that's perfect. but a city like this should not have such a ridiculous area, a shame indeed !!!"
6580,1516868,2,pipopel,26/08/2021,"Good location and quiet area, but the parking is too small for a city like Donosti. is always full"
6580,1504628,2,OriolBoada,23/08/2021,Full to bursting..and all around as well. They also fine..we are not welcome in Donosti ..
6580,1503976,4,mc26,23/08/2021,They are a bit narrow and there are always enough people to fill water but the truth is that it is very quiet and about 40 minutes from the center on foot
6580,1502311,1,mariviytxus,23/08/2021,"A ridiculous area for a city like San Sebastián. Luckily you can park in the vicinity, as long as you do not encroach on the sidewalk as they are fined 90 euros."
6580,1481938,4,logan_1976,19/08/2021,"Very good and quiet area. You can empty gray and black and fill water for free even if you are not in the area, for that reason there is always a lot of queue to empty. Go early to host a place, it fills up fast. The one that does not fit parks nearby, next to the university, paying the OTA zone."
6580,1474235,3,DavidPinto,18/08/2021,We arrived early and it was not difficult to find a place. Rather fair squares but to spend a night and get to know San Sebastián well. Nearby bus stop that takes you to the center or to the beach
6580,1468904,2,PepitoGrillo21,17/08/2021,"Very difficult to find a place, it is very small. Quite continually busy. The square is very fair. Bus stop very close, in a few minutes it takes you to the beach or to the city center for 1.85. For a night or two it's worth it"
6580,1465112,5,Rafikis,16/08/2021,"The area is great, in a secluded area, adequate soil, easy access from the highway and a walk to Ondarreta beach. It is always crowded but there is a lot of movement. It's a bit of a rush to see the surroundings full of ACs with all the gear out. Let's respect the rules: we can eat inside, our vehicles are prepared for it. Attitudes like this give the entire industry a bad name"
6580,1459740,3,selmar89,15/08/2021,The area is in a quiet place ... quite far from the center. The tap to fill the water works fatally ... it has no pressure ... I hope they fix it soon ... for the rest we were pretty calm.
6580,1459727,5,CeliaBarnert,15/08/2021,"It is totally worth paying the € 7.60 for 24 hours. A very quiet area, with surveillance (the police stopped by several times to make sure everything was okay), surrounded by trees and a few minutes from several buses that lead directly to Playa de la Concha. There were no toilets. IMPORTANT: arrive in the morning, around 9: 30-10 it starts to fill up and afterwards it is difficult to find a place"
6580,1459592,3,1982sandra,15/08/2021,"Small area it was impossible to get a place, in the street just below if we could do the night but you can not get any chair or table on the sidewalk. It took a long time for the police to come to tell us to pick up, most of them were dining out like us, away from the center to visit."
6580,1456343,4,Tritxe,14/08/2021,"Perfect for visiting the city, the bad, that it is small, difficult to find a place."
6580,1440424,4,Eserrant,11/08/2021,"If you arrive between 9.30 and 10.00 in the morning, you will probably find a place. The rest is a lottery. The area is quiet and 20 minutes from La Concha beach. If you have a bike, great because you have a lane that takes you directly. There is a little collapse for filling and emptying with glue to access. The truth is that it falls short for a city like Donosti. Copy Bilbao!"
6580,1439893,4,annsoslvt,11/08/2021,"Places are quickly taken! Be careful, the only place to spend the night in San Sebastián, you have to arrive between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. 25 minutes walk from the beach and the funicular, it's great. Quiet place"
6580,1436703,2,Madbird,10/08/2021,"Too bad that a city like Donostia has such a small area, at least in Summer luck to find a hole."
6580,1434094,5,alvanee,10/08/2021,Quiet area to park during the day and spend the night. We arrived at 11 am and found a place without problem in the month of August. The minimum amount to pay is € 7.60 / 24 h and you can spend a maximum of 72 hours renewing the payment ticket. It is close to bus stops and bike lanes to get to the beach and the old town quickly and easily. It has a free gray and black water filling and emptying service.
6580,1431756,1,rebeyjaumeti,09/08/2021,"Fatal! We arrived, parked, everything seemed fine. The little girl was already asleep, 11:15 p.m., the police tell us how we stand out because we can't be behind. Like almost all the ACs there were, that is, the ones that did not stand out, Furgos and vans. I do not understand, if it is an AC area because they do not make the places for AC. At least don't warn at bedtime. All to move, at the same time and in search of a place. The Girl wakes up and everything is wrong."
6580,1422439,5,alvarezdesande,08/08/2021,"Very busy area, we had a hard time finding a place but in the end we made it. Perfect place to rest, we spent two nights there. It is best to go first thing in the morning to find a place. People leave early"
6580,1420564,2,meritxellp,07/08/2021,"We went at 12 noon and there was no longer a place, very few places. Perfect for emptying and filling water. We parked on the street that goes up to the parking lot but BEWARE they will fine if you leave the blue line, there were many AC tickets. 25-30 minutes walk to the center of San Sebastian, there is also a bike path and a bus that takes you to the center. Perfect parking to go to visit the center."
6580,1416300,5,Vanthingstodo,07/08/2021,"Great place with free services like grey water and fresh water refill. Cannot fit man camper vans and it’s full at 13:00 during high season. Police comes by every day to check all is ok and tickets. Don’t recommend to do any type of camping, it’s not allowed."
6580,1413746,1,pallars,06/08/2021,"A pity that Donosti does not have a larger area, it takes care of it right away. Surroundings there are many possibilities to have a better area ..."
6580,1405799,4,strauel,04/08/2021,"Felt very safe. Close to the city center. (also bus station is near the parking) 
No toilets or showers."
6580,1400543,4,Filspellward,03/08/2021,"Very busy site but ideal for visiting the city, where the black, grey and water are is quite dirty and smelly
we were there 3 days and it was full each day by 13.00"
6580,1395160,5,WanderWebb,02/08/2021,"Excellent position to explore the city. Easy access to the beach and promenade. This place gets really really busy from very early in the morning with people both wanting to park and those also just using the services. Very quiet district, especially over the weekend."
6580,1393946,4,mapitb5,02/08/2021,"Good place, close to shops, bars, laundry ... we were lucky to find a space because it is a very busy place both to spend the night and to drain water. The police stop by every so often to keep watch. We went with integral AC."
6580,1392440,4,TribalG,01/08/2021,Busy motorhome park ... what's to be expected in such a nice city. Very well located at 2km from the beach and 3km from the old town! 7.60€ for 24:00 and you can refuel and pilot water. Limited places ... in high season you have to be lucky that there is room ... we were there before 12:00 and there were still a few places available.
6580,1381036,5,yes_224,30/07/2021,"Admittedly this is only a parking lot, we are glued to each other. But incredibly convenient for visiting San Sebastian. There is a secure cycle path that starts 100m from there and takes us to the old town and even further to the top. The parking lot empties between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m. and fills up quickly."
6580,1380769,4,cpb39,30/07/2021,"Ideal for visiting the city: 30 minutes on foot and well served by bus. Very quiet at night. It is preferable in season to arrive relatively early. At noon, there were only 3 places left."
6580,1378371,5,Maktedelic,29/07/2021,"Very close to the city. 15 minutes by bike to the old town. You feel very safe, the police drive along the square several times a day. Price: 7.60 euros for 24 hours. Amazingly calm at night."
6580,1366836,5,navenodriza,26/07/2021,It is very quiet. The police came by several times a day. Maximum 72h
6580,1365120,4,jsda,25/07/2021,"Good area, near the beach taking a pleasant walk price 7.60 24 hours you pay at the parking meter located at the entrance, in terms of security, I saw the police pass several times,"
6580,1356296,5,alex290,23/07/2021,Ideal area for visiting the city bus 5 or 25 € 1.85 each way. the area is quickly filled up at 4 p.m. only one place available many van and motorhome passed by without finding a place
6580,1349734,5,jiranzo,22/07/2021,"Great area to visit San Sebastian. It is worth € 7.60 for 24 hours. Free filling and emptying of water. Perhaps the only downside is that the turn after the water zone is somewhat narrow for large ACs. When we arrived there were some cars parked not respecting the prohibition of not parking for them, but the police came, fined them and took them away. A 10 for them."
6580,1347557,2,Fernandotkd,21/07/2021,"Many very small vans unfortunately do not control the reservation for housing vehicles. They are going to load everything, where they do their necessities, they are cooking outside, first thing in the morning they go out to breakfast in the street without any respect. I hold the managers of the MOTORHOMES area responsible, I suppose it will be the Town Hall."
6580,1345495,5,MarcosGrazina,20/07/2021,"I also recommend installing the ElParking app that allows you to pay for parking at a distance. It was recommended to me by Trafikoa's agents and it works flawlessly: mark the site, enter the vehicle registration number, pay and enjoy San Sebastian!"
6580,1345484,5,MarcosGrazina,20/07/2021,"Fantastic area. Black, gray and water inlet discharge zone. A bit cramped places (open awnings and set up tables is to forget) but you can handle AC well (ours is 7m). It has a huge bike path to the beaches and restaurant areas. Bus alternatives close by. It's a paid area, it has a parking meter but when I came (Tuesday) I paid 2.10€ from 15:00 to 20:00. Come early!! Fills up fast!"
6580,1334781,5,Burritos,18/07/2021,"We spent 2 very quiet nights, the places well defined and comfortable. You get to the beach by walking in about 30 minutes. Buses 40 and 36 (the latter seemed better to us for the return to the parking lot). Recommended area."
6580,1322136,4,EsthervdAa,14/07/2021,"Despite the parking lot being completely full, we spent a very quiet night here. It is a half hour walk to San Sebastian or the beach. Great for €7.60 (high season) so close to the city!"
6580,1307826,4,RosieMobieleHuis,09/07/2021,Very quiet place. Good for visiting SanSe.
6580,1307370,4,Festin,09/07/2021,"Perfect for visiting San Sebastian, you can go for a walk to the beach and the center. Very calm and cool. A bit fair for such a visited and beautiful city. It seems that the robbery thing has calmed down."
6580,1306472,5,joluses,08/07/2021,"Well located somewhat narrow but very good to spend the night, the bus stop to go down to the city center is in front of the lines 30 and 44 area, it is usually very full in high season."
6580,1301361,5,salvaxemente,06/07/2021,"Very green place, quiet and 30 min walk from the shell. Cool."
6580,1298222,3,Rehauge,05/07/2021,We arrived around 12:00 p.m. There are still some free places. We like it a lot and it's amazingly quiet.
6580,1296822,4,perretmail,04/07/2021,Overall positive
6580,1293453,3,infante46,03/07/2021,For a city like Donostia I expected a better equipped and bigger area
6580,1290475,1,minou111,02/07/2021,"Many camper. They take out tables, chairs, etc. and they make life outside. Before 7:00 in the morning awake, too much noise."
6580,1289181,4,micala,01/07/2021,"No beauty, but quiet, clean and with nice surroundings. In walkable distance to the city center and beach (20-30min). Currently the parking machine works only with credit card (no cash)."
6580,1285113,4,burrilugo,29/06/2021,We spent one night here yesterday and everything was perfect. There were places and we were able to rest without problem. We found it to be a safe area despite some comment below that scared us. It takes 15/20 min walking to Ondarreta Beach and 35 min to the town hall. Perfect walk to enjoy the best pinchos!
6580,1284889,5,juanreus,29/06/2021,Great area with all its services ... 20 minutes walk from the center ...
6580,1283370,5,lauraFdzPrz,28/06/2021,"We were great, we spent one night with the AC and paid 7.60 euros. Very quiet, well indicated and easy to get to. We walked to the Ondarreta beach, it took us 15 minutes"
6580,1282769,4,Anais.hvx,28/06/2021,"We spent a night there in a van, no worries. Just remember to take your valuables with you, thefts are notorious. ;)"
6580,1282269,4,Lorcri,27/06/2021,"A great place in the center, for about € 7 a whole day, you have gray, black and water rubber services, we were a little scared by the comments of some robberies in the area, but our experience was great."
6580,1276771,5,mari82,25/06/2021,"Perfect place to spend the night. quiet area with water drainage service and fountain. price in high season € 7'60 / 24h (minimum to pay 24h). It is about 20 min walk from Ondarreta beach, there is also a bus service between the center and the parking lot."
6580,1272884,5,dragon_torralba,23/06/2021,It's great near the beach a. Let's go for a walk ... thank you very much to the San Sebastián city hall I know how great in the old town and the beach is super beautiful
6580,1265646,3,gervicen,20/06/2021,"It is appreciated that there is an area in Donostia, the location is adequate, but the area is too small, the plots too. I have to say that more and more, and this time in this area, people are disrespectful, noisy and carefree towards others. The price is 7.50 in high season. And certainly not enough space this season."
6580,1265639,5,viajespipa,20/06/2021,We slept very well without noise 7 euros 24 hours. Near La Concha beach and the promenade
6580,1212620,1,jllaguardia,23/05/2021,"If you read the comments you will see that it is not a safe area, the city council does not take measures, last night they entered a few."
6580,1210964,1,Milyseoderuta,22/05/2021,Beware in this area that they rob frequently
6580,1210283,1,txirola,22/05/2021,"Well again they have stolen in more than 5 motorhomes and above at night. If the police or the city council does nothing to avoid it, avoid this area."
6580,1208339,4,Rafa58,20/05/2021,"A little far from the center 30 minutes walk but it is good and quiet, somewhat small for San Sebastián since it is a very touristy city but thank you for thinking of us and adapting this area to us .. Price € 3.30 per day."
6580,1185132,4,francou46,04/05/2021,"Return to France, test to be done in San Sebastian. We returned to the area where we had stopped on the way out. Always very quiet at night, regular passage of the police, we felt safe. Perfect for getting into town with bikes, cycle paths everywhere. Very good spot."
6580,1181758,5,aussteiger1993,29/04/2021,Excellent .... central and quiet .... thanks to the city
6580,1173337,1,kellyenmarc,13/04/2021,"After visiting San Sebastian, we returned to the camper to find that the kitchen window had been smashed. because of this they could not enter so they also forced the lock of the passenger door. fortunately only a backpack and sunglasses away. there were 10 other campers, mainly Spaniards. nobody saw anything. well received by the police"
6580,1173330,3,vanbanana,13/04/2021,"Good area, apparently quiet. Today around 2:00 p.m. they have entered to rob the motorhome next door. there were more campers, they have no mercy ... careful."
6580,1171892,4,Txegi,11/04/2021,"To be in a PERFECT city, I do not give it a 10 because there were no more places or tables to eat outside, the filling water has little flow"
6580,1169419,5,gersansi,06/04/2021,"It is very good, the only thing that there are few plots for such a beautiful city. To the old town you can take public transport, by bike, a lot of bike lanes and walking a beautiful walk of about 40 minutes ..."
6580,1161810,4,kalimerue,31/03/2021,Great place. Buses 5 and 25 can be used to get to the centenary. A great place to get to know the old quarter.
6580,1158209,4,xabatiko,26/03/2021,"Good area although it is short of places for a city like Donosti, good location with respect to the city, bus 5 min walk and the beach about 15 min walk."
6580,1156511,5,carpemdiem,24/03/2021,They robbed us of three motorhomes.
6580,1144495,5,munknellemann,28/02/2021,"We were very happy with this little spot in Winter. Green area to air the dogs, quiet. Placed in a nice modern part of the town with the university just next door. We walked to the beach (20-30 minutes) and from there to the city centre. Such a nice city."
6580,1123450,4,Bartmensch,23/12/2020,"Good space, disposal and water works € 3.30 per night at the parking machine"
6580,1123426,4,florielleV,23/12/2020,Very nice and safe parking space. You can walk to the beach and center. Plenty of tents in the area for breakfast. Parking meter just requires some patience and attention. But for 3.30 euros a night a place with water and landfill to go more often.
6580,1113531,5,Lilydebuch,08/11/2020,"We spent a few days there last year for Christmas. Clean and quiet place, we will go back."
6580,1110006,4,Scilash66,31/10/2020,It is not a bad area as it is a bit secluded from the city and therefore very quiet and surrounded by greenery. The services are well accessible. Secluded but not far from the coast. San Sebastian is truly worth a stop! Very beautiful and characteristic.
6580,1109741,4,francou46,30/10/2020,"We spent a night, very quiet, few people in this season. Perfect after a long drive. Thank you"
6580,1109048,4,manshivas,29/10/2020,"A little tight, the pitches are narrow, it is not possible to take the table out. Cheap, 3.30 €, but provide cash with the exact amount, payment by credit card does not work. Not too far on foot from the bay, the night was calm."
6580,1102481,5,ivoderooij,22/10/2020,"Neat camper place on the outskirts of the city, Good to walk to boulevard. Facilities are free and parking costs 3.30 per day (in September anyway). This amount must be exactly thrown into the parking machine for a parking ticket. Pin or credit card does not work."
6580,1093812,2,markdspot,14/10/2020,"We got robbed. don't let this worry you,  take precautions, these people are opportunistic and they will never disappear,  be wise and you will beat them.  Peace."
6580,1088269,4,faurys93,10/10/2020,Well yes we are tight like sardines and it is 3.5 km from the city center and the nights are agitated since the Spaniards live at night and can arrive until 1 am and fill and unload in the middle of the night (we were at next to the station: /) but hey it has the merit of existing for this pretty town.
6580,1084617,5,ferremek,07/10/2020,"Nice parking with lots of spaces. €3,30 for 24 hours."
6580,1083663,4,JeannePalazzi,06/10/2020,"Very good, regular passage of the police. Price: 3.30 € for 24 hours, 6.60 € for 48 hours."
6580,1076388,4,digitaldesignnomad,30/09/2020,"We stayed there for three nights and felt safe. Gray water emptying and clean water to fill up. No black water disposal, only cassettes. You can't stand better with a motorhome in San Sebastián unless you go to a campsite outside of it."
6580,1072895,4,evagutierrez,27/09/2020,"Area in the University area, quiet area. We were at the beginning of September and at midday it was already full, with a bus stop very close that takes you to the center, although in 25 m. You arrive at La Concha beach, with a bike path. It is necessary to be able to connect."
6580,1071872,4,vilma_d,27/09/2020,We stayed here for one night on 23.09. The place is perfect for visiting city. It's only 30 minutes walk to the city centre. The car park is quite good. We manage to pay just in cash and you need to have exact amount because it would not give you change. So 7.60eur for 24h. There is security guy coming few times a day to check.
6580,1065109,3,budisvan,23/09/2020,"We spent a night in the fall, a quiet night without incident, with services, a feeling of being all very close, it is still an area in a city."
6580,1064753,4,davidch,22/09/2020,"We arrived at night, we waited until 00:00 to pay for the whole day (€ 7.60). Very quiet and we had no problems. There is a fountain and to drain the gray water."
6580,1063058,4,Juanangarcia,21/09/2020,"Perfect to see the city, from there to the zurriola it is about 4.5 km that to walk and spend the whole day is not bad. The price of a day is 7.60"
6580,1062893,4,gimenells,21/09/2020,"If you go with a large AC, it must be one of the best options to park in San Sebastian. € 7.60 24h."
6580,1055942,3,Dudu0814,18/09/2020,"Expensive parking, with services!"
6580,1055193,3,Takel,17/09/2020,"It is not a campsite, it is an unguarded AC parking. Not much shade but flat. We spent two very quiet nights. 15 minutes from the center by bus (there are several that take you). At the ticket machine, if you pay in cash, go with the exact amount."
6580,1045916,3,joseisa3,13/09/2020,"As the area is not bad, the only bad thing is: the emptying and filling area is in bad condition ... they should improve it ... the squares at this time are full but there are always two or three free I was from 9 to 11 the only thing bad the clever dog that left him locked in the car and wouldn't stop barking ... the rest all right, good people and 10 minutes walk from the beach"
6580,1045149,4,PepeMarot,13/09/2020,Very quiet paid parking with emptying and water service. We went in September and in the middle of the morning it got busy.
6580,1043325,3,DanArKemper,12/09/2020,"Advantages, proximity to town, cycle path, fair price."
6580,1043258,3,wanillo,12/09/2020,The environment we met was not very good. It was relatively close to the center and well connected with the bus. The parking meter has information a bit confusing. We specified a few to get the ticket at 00:00 because we suspected that it counts by days and not by hours and it had arrived at 10:30 p.m. It was full when we got there barely 3 free parking spaces. There is no space to open awnings or tables or anything.
6580,1034617,1,cinnekelove,08/09/2020,"I do not recommend it. They stole everything that was inside the motorhome in broad daylight and also from others who were parked there. I don't recommend the spot, they broke in at daylight and stole everything that was in our mobilhome. same thing happened to another couple the same day."
6580,1019681,3,Angelinamex,01/09/2020,"Fab location, sadly broken into whilst out for the day, window forced"
6580,1015373,4,crisosuna,30/08/2020,"Good area, quiet and silent night. I would appreciate if the squares were wider as it was crowded and claustrophobic .. on our visit it was all very clean."
6580,1006515,4,baloo75,27/08/2020,"Great area, bus 5 or 25 take you to the beaches or downtown. quiet. We arrived on Saturday and it was only halfway there .... I guess there are fewer tourists this year. The only downside is the emptying and filling area, which is very dirty and smells bad."
6580,1005668,4,JaviMcrae,26/08/2020,"Good area, 15 minutes walk to the beach. 7.60 euros for 24 hours. Recommendable."

6580,992083,4,05kar,22/08/2020,"Half an hour walk from the beach of La Concha. Good place, quiet, it would be appreciated if the squares were wider in this time of the covid"
6580,990351,3,jgoiko,22/08/2020,"A good option to sleep and visit Donosti but unfortunately more spaces and services are needed for an area like this. Although the initiatives are appreciated, we hope it will improve."
6580,987167,4,martia25,21/08/2020,It is a good option to visit Donosti with AC. It would be interesting if the campers with dogs collected the droppings because it is all full of poop. I have nothing against dogs but people who are not responsible for them. We will take care of what belongs to everyone
6580,983678,3,pinouche86,20/08/2020,"Correct area, large cycle path to reach the beach 2km and the old town 5km. Paying parking 7.6 for 24 hours pay attention after noon otherwise parking stops at midnight. Terminal only cash, CB HS. Too bad not being able to take out chairs and table."
6580,978954,3,lesgrats,18/08/2020,"Spent one night on the area, paid 7.60 €. Provide a small connection for recharging with water. 20 min walk from Ondarreta beach. Bus to visit the nearby city at 1.85 € per person. Beautiful city and very pleasant to visit."
6580,975354,4,Erasmus77,17/08/2020,"Very good parking space for caravans for max. 2 nights to visit San Senastian. High season € 7.60 per night. Walk to the beach about 20 minutes. Bus stop is also not far. Tip: Very good pizzeria ""B17"" right around the corner from the parking space."
6580,965582,4,Quini.Teis,15/08/2020,"Perfect place to visit San Sebastián if you take a place, we arrived at 10:15 on a Saturday and there were 3 free places. We pay € 7.90 for 24 hours. I advise emptying very early as it tends to saturate after 10, we all want to empty at the same time. Bike path about 200m, perfect to go to the beaches and downtown."
6580,960388,2,tornasol,13/08/2020,"It is very expensive !!!!, I paid € 15.40 for only 24 hours and all tight together, the covid will be super happy, no separation, there is no other option to visit the city. Better to park during the day, take the bus and sleep somewhere else. Never again in this time of pademic."
6580,955916,5,yako242,12/08/2020,"Excellent parking, very safe to go to the beach and the city center without nerves, bus very close and several shops m, you can not ask for more for only € 7.60 a day."
6580,950495,4,alongland1,11/08/2020,"Location, location, location. If you don’t mind being hemmed in so close together you can hear a baby crying one side, snoring the other and a dog barking in the van opposite, this site is absolutely worth it for the location. You can cycle down to the centre in around 10 minutes and 15 minutes by the bus which is just round the corner. The best place in San Seb for a motorhome."
6580,946187,4,Duque73,10/08/2020,"Very quiet, shade, there is usually room during the week. Bus 33, 35 and 40 take you to Ondarribia beach and downtown."
6580,944575,3,bichas7,09/08/2020,Very good area but with few sites. Difficult to get. It is paid and only has water.

6580,931205,4,florianbraakman,05/08/2020,"Great spot for visiting San Sebastian. Bring coins for parking machine, exact amount of €7,60. Didnt take our card."
6580,922998,1,Maor,02/08/2020,Very small it is always full we have not been able to park on several occasions it is not worth even trying
6580,920206,5,checkouteleven,02/08/2020,"Unbeatable for the price. Had a very quiet night. Close to the center (about 45 minutes on foot) or about 500m by bus. Parking ticket is valid 24 hours. Very full, almost every parking bay is occupied, the area could be a bit larger."
6580,919389,4,AEcosse,01/08/2020,"We didnt nees or use facilities, just a place to park overnight, we arrived about 10pm, and took the last spot on a friday night, quite"
6580,914557,4,RaquelLa,31/07/2020,"We have paid two great days. Although in the comments there was that there is usually no place, we have always seen free places at different times of the day. It is a good area to know San Sebastián. The maximum stay is 72h but the machine's dataphone does not work so you have to bring loose coins. The water faucet works regularly and is made to fill forever."
6580,907043,4,CarlosCastro,28/07/2020,"My friend Pol got up in the middle of the night to pee (he has a very sensitive bladder), but since there were no toilets, he had to do it among some bushes. Otherwise, it is a quite useful area to visit San Sebastián."
6580,905894,4,CristianKrusty,28/07/2020,"Quiet place with plenty of space for caravans / camper. They fit about 35. You have to pay, there is room for water and emptying but without services. A little far to visit Donosti"
6580,905853,1,Wildfox001,28/07/2020,"A very small area, ACs are literally packaged"
6580,891143,5,SantiagoMoreno,23/07/2020,"Very crowded area, although it has enough places for AC. Quiet area, about 15/20 minutes from Ondarreta beach. To go to the downtown area better take the bus (walking 1 hour approx.). The bus is taken at the university (number 3 and 5) price € 1.85. Payment of € 7.60 / 24 h. The machine works regularly (better to pay in cash or credit card). Very clean and quiet. Recommendable."
6580,887639,5,dasafru,21/07/2020,It's great but it's always full
6580,877639,5,h_builtjes,18/07/2020,"Very well connected to the beach and city centre by a bike path, separate from the road. It's on the left side of the road when you are heading to the beach (we first couldnt find it). Also feels safe to cycle at night.
There are clean public toilets and showers at the beach for those with a small van like us (7 min cycle)"
6580,876613,4,Mollerussamonamur,17/07/2020,"Perfect area, clean and with water services, ideal to visit Donosti, a nearby bus line, the only one is that more seats would be needed and the payment of € 7.60 is not well understood on the ticket if it is 24 hours. or if its maturity is at 11.55pm at night. We stayed two days and without any problem and without noise to spend the night. In any case, thanks to the municipality of San Sebástian."
6580,858475,4,viajandoconLucas,10/07/2020,"payment area next to a university faculty, the center is easily reached with several buses or on foot although the old part is just over an hour. It is quiet to sleep although there is a lot of movement and the lamps give (for my taste) too much light. Motorhomes could be more careful with noise after a certain time, since the AC are close together and you can hear everything"
6580,858309,5,ElsaMoreira,10/07/2020,"Paid area, the payment machine accepts only the right amount, € 7.60! Do not accept cards or notes, take the right coins for payment! The area appears to be safe, free dumping and filling services. For those who have a bike, 5 minutes from the beach. Everything clean and careful! I recommend it for overnight stays and to do the services."
6580,856529,4,quiles11,09/07/2020,"Payment area € 7.60 but highly recommended, very quiet place and you can fill and empty all kinds of waters. Many parking lots although you should get there early because it fills up fast"
6580,843420,3,aizkorbe,01/07/2020,"payment area filled and emptied does not have much but to visit the city it is fine in the mid-morning and mid-afternoon vehicle passes and there is a sanction of 50 euros for non-payment, they report caravans, vans and vehicles not qualified as housing, as the authority reiterates that It is a motorhome-enabled area"
6580,833708,3,penngann,23/06/2020,"Calm, on the other hand without any shade. I find it expensive for services. just water and drainage. no electricity, and no toilets"
6580,794767,3,patnatlbf,12/03/2020,"Short stay of three days, everything went well until our return after a stroll in town. Fractured door theft of a watch and two pairs of sneakers. We were warned when we arrived, but now I can confirm that. Otherwise the area is good and functional."
6580,794274,1,la-croix,11/03/2020,Again a motorhome visited. Thefts are recurrent in this area. Avoid damage to the city.
6580,793625,2,grosphil,10/03/2020,"Beware of thefts, they entered through the sliding window of the motorhome during our city walk, computer and other theft"
6580,788044,5,dbol26,28/02/2020,"Great spot for campers right by the city, theres a water point, grey water point, bins and €3.30 a night for up to 3 nights was perfect. only a little noise and we just went for a espresso in the morning in a cafe for €1/€1.20 :) super cheap in town and then able to use toilets in the cafe."
6580,787804,2,ealonsoa75,28/02/2020,"Very good area, but always full. Impossible to access it, cars are stably parked, so there are hardly any places in rotation. A shame in a city like San Sebastián. 44 places that are useless. In the adjacent streets you can park, but they are very noisy and with cars passing at high speed."
6580,786098,3,ericpouy,24/02/2020,Electricity is missing :(
6580,784823,4,Avalonwolf,22/02/2020,Nice parking space to explore San Sebastián. approx. 45 minutes on foot to the old town. But good bus connections and great bike paths. The parking space is really full at the weekend and got the last free space on Fridays at 2.30 p.m. But it was also a carnival on Saturday. Everything is available except for electricity. € 3.30 per day. Vending machine only takes small change or card. Great city
6580,784140,5,YAYAFRANKY,21/02/2020,"We slept there tonight and for 3.40 the place is very good, quite quiet, 20 min from the beach on foot. nearby has buses to move and bike lane. You have to go in the morning because it is full and it is difficult to park in other places since it is all blue zone."
6580,783289,5,janner,20/02/2020,Great location for city we rode our bikes along seafront great safe bike lanes agree need exact money for meter at camp spot credit card did not work will definitely stay here as other sites tricky for lArge motor home but do have earplugs as bizarrely the birds sing all night due to lights on in the cpi g spot
6580,782209,5,jpg.rocky,18/02/2020,"Busy place but there were around 6 spaces left. Just be aware machine expects exact change to work.  We didn't have the smaller coins so used credit card.  Very nice location, quiet, not far to work to front"
6580,780002,4,pec66,14/02/2020,"2 nights spent for € 6.60, including oil changes and water. Correct location. The city center is accessible on foot, bicycle or bus. Shops nearby. For payment, you need to top up, failed to pay with the credit card"
6580,779536,4,alain_spam,12/02/2020,"For 3.30 / 24h difficult to do better. The places are large. Water ok. Pizzeria across the road. Public transport ok for the center or by bike, with the cycle lanes it is done in 10 minutes."
6580,779208,4,JORG3,11/02/2020,Parking very well located. Free water service. Overnight very quiet and for 3.30euros is almost perfect! The bike paths to visit San Sebastian are just great.
6580,778558,5,Antaress,10/02/2020,"Area within the urban area, in universities area. Bus 5 and 25 to the center with a very close stop. Walking to Ondarreta beach in about 20 minutes (very pleasant walk) Amount to be paid by parking meter when entering: 3.30 euros (24 hours) Quiet area with fair services. Very advisable"

6580,777096,5,Cecilehb,07/02/2020,Really no complaints at this price. 10 mins walk from the 1st shops.
6580,776623,4,Gildor,05/02/2020,"I confirm all the positive comments. I would add that you need to top up (€ 3.30) for the automatic device to work ... if you enter € 3.50, it does not give you a ticket."
6580,776102,4,jacknight,04/02/2020,I confirm the comments.
6580,769839,5,ashleyseychelle,18/01/2020,Plenty of space (in January) so no issue with finding a spot. Lots of other proper campervans there coming and going but no issue with noise - everyone was very considerate. €3.30 for the day (the cheapest by far compared to other options in the area) and felt safe
6580,768649,4,KallePef,14/01/2020,"Very central for visiting Donostia-San Sebastián. However, very well attended. You need luck or have to be there early. On WE full!"

6580,767931,2,akawana,12/01/2020,"Very well located but very few places to be such a tourist capital. The squares are quite small. The emptying area is neglected, the screams have been bad for a long time."

6580,766397,5,Agnesdu29,08/01/2020,"Motorhome area at 3.30 euros for 24 hours with water filling, gray and black water drainage. It takes about 40 minutes to downtown on foot along the ledge, very pleasant walk. Calm night. Buses to the city are nearby, line 5 or 25."
6580,766134,5,katy47,08/01/2020,"Thank you to the municipality for this very clean and free area services included just a downside the taps are directed to the wall, impossible to put water in the wc cassette to clean as well as to fill the camper, otherwise area well placed to visit even the city on foot, the night was calm. I recommend"
6580,763841,3,Gorkalaitz,04/01/2020,It is fine but very small for all the tourism there is. Price is perfect.
6580,762709,4,Jonypere,03/01/2020,"Very good AC to visit Donosti. 20 min from the beach and 40 from downtown. There is bus line next door. It is paid in park meter, admits or coins (take the exact amount) or card. I do not put the 5 star because it remains somewhat fair of places. we have been lucky and when we arrived (18:30) another AC was leaving. Others have parked in places outside places."

6580,759783,5,estei33,30/12/2019,"We spent 2 nights on this area, € 3.30 with emptying and water services except electricity. Cash payment only CB out of service. Located 20 minutes from the beach on foot but 40 minutes from the historic center (tapas). No security concerns for us, the police often pass by. A little on top of each other but we're in town, arrive before 10am because it's full. Many motorhomes find themselves lacking space in the surrounding car parks. 2 very pleasant days and nights in this beautiful but expensive city."
6580,758795,3,JavierMajuelo,29/12/2019,"Yesterday we arrived at 6 pm and impossible to park. I do not understand how a city like this does not have a large area for acs. This one stays very small. In the area of the universities that are next door, you can park and sleep without problem."
6580,758258,4,superfamilyonroad,28/12/2019,"In the morning it has been impossible for us to park and we have parked 2 'in front of the faculties. In the afternoon we waited patiently and 2-3 seats were left free. Quiet parking, well leveled, with the possibility of emptying and filling water."

6580,752081,4,Plaeuskadi,09/12/2019,"Good area away from the center but taking place is a matter of luck, it was full. Bus 33 brings you to the funicular square for Mount Igeldo. The 5 brings you closer to the center. Thanks to the town hall"
6580,751666,5,calibeach,08/12/2019,Perfect. Few places for a city like Donostia. Bus 25 and 5 to go downtown (15min). walking 2'5kms (30min)

6580,706338,5,ademortier,27/09/2019,Very practical area to discover San Sebastian. Beautiful city and beach. Yes some motorhomes use the drinking water tap to rinse the cassettes. No reason to penalize this very useful area.

6580,692221,4,jailena,15/09/2019,"The area is fine although all motorhomes are very tight, even a caravan. Very well connected to the center by bus and with bars nearby."
6580,688167,1,DIVERPAT,13/09/2019,The war of ragpickers to have a place on this area with sardines. A shame for a city like this to have so few locations. € 7.60 to relegate motorhomes (who are also consumers) to the bottom of such a rat hole is lamentable and unacceptable.
6580,687152,2,Ndevrieze,12/09/2019,"Too litlle space for many passing campers. So a lot of notice during night.
Quite far from city center. Approx 40 min walk, better by bike. No electricity, water ok. Paiement only in cash plus exact amount (7,60€/day september)"

6580,670102,2,Aidaia,31/08/2019,"We went in Caravan and stayed 1 night. The police happened a couple of times and they didn't tell us anything (because we had paid) but the next day the patrol that happened didn't like us and forced us to leave, they said it was only for “motor homes” ... It's a secluded place and pretty. Our German neighbors who went by motorhome were robbed of the iPad when they left in the afternoon ... they looked professional because they don't know how they could get inside. For what they offer (only water and discharges) and how insecure it is, it is expensive (7.60 euros a day). You have to go soon because if there is no place."
6580,668693,1,tiiito27,30/08/2019,"Not enough parking spaces! So we parked just before the entrance, which was also paid parking. We were only there for a couple of hours and WE GOT ROBBED!!! They took everything of value (bike, laptops, cameras, cash) and in the process they broke the locks and window catches. They went through everything, and we weren't the only ones! There were at least 3 others that got robbed!!"

6580,641024,5,VeraLis,18/08/2019,"We could not enter the area, since in summer San Sebastián is full of people, but in the surroundings (near the faculties) there is a lot of parking, and it is full of motorhomes, it is about 25 minutes walk from the beach, and about 40 from the center. Very quiet place, and recommended. We were able to fill and unload in the area without problem."
6580,638110,3,Jasalop,17/08/2019,Quiet and safe area. The police pass continuously. But in summer it stays small and hopefully you'll find a place. Other times I was always lucky to find a place. But this time I had to park outside where we had about 50 Acs.
6580,636728,2,muon17,17/08/2019,Too small area for such a city that is worth a look. Be patient to have a place on the air in high season.

The day we were there, they entered in one afternoon in 4 motor homes to steal, and in so many that park outside, the police continually pass from there. EYE, CLOSE WELL DOORS, WINDOWS, AND SET THE ALARM. It may be this week as it is the city party."
6580,625360,3,camilla17,13/08/2019,"Parking a half hour from the Concha beach and very convenient for visiting San Sebastián on foot. Pitches very close together but the cost is paltry, 7.60 euros per day. Water loading and unloading. Quiet at night"
6580,622290,4,wuisin,12/08/2019,"Area 15 minutes from the beach of La Concha, for a city with San Sebastian is quite small, parking is allowed in the squares that are around the area, at the same price.

6580,616495,5,Ila-Cri,10/08/2019,As described. I only add stalls with a slight slope and the daily cost of the ticket is understood up to 23.59. So to stay overnight they must be paid 2 days
6580,603255,4,irisluca,06/08/2019,"Recommended area 15 minutes from the beach. We stayed two days. On the beach of Ondarreta you have shower service for € 1.10. And to the center you can go by bus or walk back or ride a bike, the bike path is very good."

6580,584054,2,petriple,29/07/2019,It is an area saturated with tails to supply water and release the detritus. Small number of places at the price of $ 7.60 well connected from the center with coach 5 and 25. Just behind the stop is the laundry and on the other corner a supermarket.
6580,578671,2,mascanc,27/07/2019,"Horrible area, small, but comfortable enough to visit the city. Since so many campers park outside, there is a lot of tail to the unloaded load"
6580,573399,3,Alberto1963,24/07/2019,It is fine but it is scarce of everything for a city like San Sebastian. many motorhomes around. spaces are missing.
6580,568993,1,stayfree11,22/07/2019,In summer insufficient in all aspects. The only positive is the location.
6580,568387,2,Monan,22/07/2019,"It is always full since it is small for the number of visits the city has. In addition, it is poorly designed. It is queued when you want to empty and enter the area. It can be better"
6580,561393,3,rossa,18/07/2019,"It is a simple car park, where you can spend no more than 1 or 2 nights. if you have bicycles, it is perfect because the cycle path will take you to the beaches and the historic center in 15 minutes ... otherwise a long walk of at least 40 minutes ... Loading, water drainage present. € 7.60 per day."
6580,561158,3,heula14,18/07/2019,"Classic parking but very well located because the bike path in front of the car park leads directly to the beaches (2.2 km), the historic center (3.5 km) and at the very top of the mountain (castle at 120 m altitude). For joggers: 10 km AR with spectacular views"

6580,557239,5,os954,16/07/2019,"Excellent place enabled by the town hall. Of payment but of contained price it offers the possibility of making the changes of water that you need. Very quiet place and perfectly connected to all services. We travel by bike and in 3 minutes you get on the beach of the shell. The drawback is that it fills up soon, there are not enough places. But at least the town hall has had the detail of enabling a place like this for us! The others should take an example."
6580,550425,5,SAER,12/07/2019,"Excellent place to sleep, only 15 minutes walking to the beach! It is important to pay and leave the ticket in sight inside the caravan as the police pass by checking."

6580,536833,4,titomon,02/07/2019,"The area is small for the great demand there is. If you take a site, it's great. In a walk you are on the beach. By putting a snag, the water load becomes eternal."
6580,518086,1,itsasoa,16/06/2019,"Few places. For the price that is paid, there is only the water drain service. There were some guys doing a barbecue, the people in charge went by, we complained but they did not attract attention."

6580,360452,4,osakkka,31/08/2018,"Perfeco, ideal to visit the city. By bike you get up in 10 minutes (beware that the bike lane does not exist in the last section). Area a little tight with gray and black discharge. Nearby bars with good breakfasts. What else can you ask for € 7.60?"
6580,355943,3,dometisa,27/08/2018,"Very quiet at night '7.60 €. on the other hand, quickly saturated. water and emptying free ... finally included in the price. payment in cash only and better to have the right account."

6580,349655,3,michroule,23/08/2018,"Well located, but without electricity. the service terminal is dirty. parking is complicated (small location). Bus service nearby. very noisy."

6580,325291,3,Alecamper,10/08/2018,"The only area in San sebastian. We did not find a place the first night and we slept in the parking lot around. But we know that parking in the closets around often passes the police and if the camper bursts into the sidewalk you get the ticket and send you away. Surely it is not beautiful, very tight, the tap of the water load and then very slow."
6580,324392,2,pippsvan,10/08/2018,"45 minute walk to city centre, dont really know whay you're paying for apart from water when you can park on the street round the corner like loads of others were doing. cramped and not worth the money if you are looking for a free night."
6580,317528,4,Sabrina50,06/08/2018,Clean and simple area. It is at the foot of bike paths and bus stops which allows to join the city and the beach in qq minutes. Departures and arrivals throughout the day so we can find a place at any time after his luck! ? In short for 7 € 60 a night area very well

The parking meter somewhat complicated, but we called the number of information that appears and immediately they came to help us. They are € 7.60 for 24 hours although it appears on the ticket that ends at 23.59h on the same day, they respect the 24 hours. It is quiet and close to the center, with a nearby bus stop."

Supply and disposal is included in the parking fees. The parking machine is a bit difficult and you pay per calendar day, not per night! That means you have to pay 2 days. Fully occupied in the evening in June! Greetings @_direction_happiness_"
6580,293745,2,reymag,19/07/2018,"Very small motorhome air, difficulty eating outside. City very very nice to visit, the ideal is not to have a bike"

6580,237409,4,ECM,16/04/2018,A very quiet and well located motorhome area. Worth. The only downside that I would put is that the water intake is a bit poor and if it had an electrical outlet.
6580,234789,4,specialized,08/04/2018,Very good area for a first experience in motorhome.
6580,226958,5,LeighHeyl,11/03/2018,Great location. Thank you San Sebastián.

6580,214450,4,familiailusio,11/12/2017,Large area and well connected to the center. We repeat every year.
6580,213838,2,Isartk,07/12/2017,"Inescapable place, there is no other in the city. You must have done math sup math spec to use the timestamp. Well I am blonde, without the exact supplement, no validation possible. In fact, a good way to revise your English to transmit the info and look for the 10 or 20 cts that will do all round"

6580,212798,2,MavMiv,26/11/2017,Full in mid September It seemed that the ac that had parked took time there. Fair enough to pass.
6580,212408,4,ello,24/11/2017,"Great parking for 3,30 €. Footpaths: Supermarket 10 min. Beach 15 min. Old town center 40 min. There is water, garbage cans, sewage and toilet disposal. Space is heavily frequented. In the toilet house on the beach you can take a shower for 1.10 € warm."
6580,209290,4,ScottandBec,04/11/2017,"Nice leafy, quiet location near the city. Walkable into the beach otherwise there are buses nearby - no.25 for 1.80€ that leaves on the main road next to the university. Cheap camp site that was quite busy even in November - 3.30€/ night. Felt safe. No toilets or power though which was a downside for us."
6580,208022,4,ademortier,31/10/2017,"Tight as sardines! That's the negative. Is it worth it. This city is beautiful. Do not hesitate to take the funicular. Restaurants and shops, train and beautiful beaches. Parking 3.30 € for 24h."
6580,200300,2,Argo83,04/10/2017,The price is € 3.30 for the night. Currently the terminal does not accept the blue card. You have to pay the right amount. Quiet night.
6580,196674,1,poi,23/09/2017,Parking used for want of better. Not really worthy of the beautiful city of San Sebastian. The motorhome clientele does not seem to interest them.
6580,190414,4,AussieVanMan,06/09/2017,Very safe nice and clean spot. good for cycling into town. as another comment has said the spaces are small so it's not ideal for relaxing outside your vehicle. also very very busy and hard to get a spot though there is parking down the road where we saw well over a dozen campers. in the early morning there where spots bit by evening you don't have a chance. also bring coins for the machine.
6580,188200,2,Jandri,31/08/2017,Very small area for the demand that there is. Very small spaces. In the vicinity (university area) you can park without problems in summer. A little away from the center. Despite having got space and pay we went to the surroundings to spend the night because of the overwhelm of people in such a small space.
6580,187817,4,marradr,30/08/2017,Perfect for visiting the city
6580,184228,5,raphaelserre,24/08/2017,"Good service area, more than full, places are expensive. I did just a stop emptying and full"

6580,176291,3,Tobari,16/08/2017,"The area is ridiculous for the number of visits San Sebastian has. Such a wonderful city can not have an area like that. In addition, the area of ​​the water change oozes and smells bad. In the surroundings you can spend the night without problems."
6580,174711,1,autocaravanero,14/08/2017,Area with ridiculous capacity for the tourist volume that this city has. Impossible to enter in August.
6580,174435,1,dani_ms,14/08/2017,Very small area for a city so visited. The polygon also always complete and all payment.
6580,171323,5,frankyjames,11/08/2017,"Let's bring in some German here. Here you can park very well, around the parking lot there are 4 streets with mobile homes and I had to pay nothing. Highly recommended for 1 to 2 nights. Trash cans everywhere really great. Donostia San Sebastian a dream."

6580,165702,2,jerovega7,05/08/2017,"Area always congested, there are several areas to park, better than in this neighborhood yard. One of them is next to the bullring, with water and emptying and supertranquila. What a mania to be all crowded."

6580,162871,3,familytriplyon,01/08/2017,"Basic area but well located, a stone's throw from the bus that leads to the city center. A word of advice: arrive early before noon because after that it’s complicated to find a place! Pretty town, a little tourist train ride (the pier is opposite Concha beach before the Urumea river)"
6580,152385,3,gesui,16/07/2017,"Parking well located, but very cramped and small. and always full at any time. In July it is impossible to park. We had to park more than 30 motorhomes on the streets of the faculty. Holidays, Saturday and Sunday are free. The police came by and said we could park without any problems."
6580,148085,5,1000ese,05/07/2017,Area highly recommended. It is always full. Good condition of the facilities. The number of places could be expanded. In case there is no place in the adjacent streets there are always motor homes. The beach of Ondarreta is just a walk away and La Concha is one and a half. You can take the bus to go to the center.
6580,147094,4,eeae,01/07/2017,"It is the second time we parked after three years and everything remains the same, there is no improvement or expansion despite the demand there is. I believe that such a modern city council cannot sit idly by and not solve the improvement of capacity and services. Lack of electricity, toilets and showers. There is good income and it would be very good to reinvest it."
6580,145836,5,Julu,26/06/2017,"€ 7.60 per day, maximum 72 hours. Very quiet, near university campus. There is a laundry nearby. You can go to the beach of Ondarreta taking a walk, and to the center by bus, but if you go with a great bike because there is a lane everywhere. Perfect for the city"

6580,137947,4,caronans,26/05/2017,"Rather good because not expensive. 3.30 euros per 24h and 72h maximum. A bit far from the city 20 minutes to the beach and 20 minutes more to the tourist center. Do not go your way city that deserves a stop. It is necessary to come early, at the end of the afternoon, it is more worth the dozens of vehicles make the turn in vain. Bus stop 33 100 meters out on the right, launderette two blocks. Free water but no pressure."
6580,136772,5,jean-claude65200,23/05/2017,"Don't arrive in the evening, it fills up quickly. The credit card works but you have to read the instructions carefully and be patient. Bus stop 33 exiting on the right on the hill 100 m away."

6580,129256,3,rs1davids,19/04/2017,"Small and full area no matter what time you arrive, it is incomprehensible that the parking next door has a height barrier because it is much larger than the one for the motorhomes, it should be the other way around. 15 minutes walk from La Concha area."

6580,88407,4,echojet,02/08/2016,"Very central to go to La Concha beach. The motorhome area is small but they allow you to spend the night in the University area, which costs €3 a day. There is a bus stop that takes you to the center."
6580,88252,5,josehonda,02/08/2016,"We were there on July 17 and considered it a very good area to visit the city. Less than 15 minutes walk to take the Monte Agualdo funicular. There is a bus to the center less than 500 meters away. Maybe a little small for the summer months. It has everything you need included in the price.

And we have various sizes. The black waste is the drain under the fountain right next to the kids bike park and the grey I assume goes into the street drains. The parking spaces are nice and large and located in a safe area near police and fire stations. Thank you for the area but please update the facilities a little for the best for all.

6752,2534298,1,tata13,30/12/2022,Really disgusting and embarrassing. The toilet drain is clogged by kilos and kilos of toilet paper. But it's unsanitary. I can't believe that the town hall doesn't maintain the area.

Overnight stay, no."

It is not very central since you have to walk a little, about a km. to get to the center and has no shops nearby. I don't mind, I've seen worse."

It's so full and without maintenance, that when you pour your blacks, they fall on the blacks of others and splash you.

6752,2312227,2,miriqui,28/08/2022,"It seems to me that calling it area Ac is too much to say, it's more of a parking lot with 4-5 single spaces in line on a k avenue, so cars pass by and you can hear them quite a bit, although there isn't much car traffic. What does pass are trucks from the waste center and they can be heard a lot at night. Still grateful for the facilities, quiet area despite the noise of the trucks."

Thank you for providing these services, but they are very careless..."
6752,2036979,1,RSoftware,04/07/2022,"Again the grey/black water sewer clogged and almost overflowing. It's been like this for almost a month. The Town Hall ignores the written protests. To have a motorhome area (to call it in some way) in these conditions, it is better that they remove it. Hygiene and safety conditions could not be worse. It's embarrassing."

Seems like a calm area, but nothing to see."

6752,1727168,4,josefcloud,05/01/2022,Good as a service area for water and toilet with gray water. Be careful with fresh water and toilets ... only one tap for both. Ugly as a sleeping place. Attention: in the winter months the water is turned off at the tap under the lid in the concrete box. Frost damage! Simply turn it on and at the end turn it off again and release the pressure. The city thanks.
6752,1725711,3,Siegfried33,04/01/2022,Good place to stay for a night. Possibility to dispose (gray /black water). A bit street noises. No issue for me. We felt safe.
6752,1723915,5,DaviddeTudela,02/01/2022,We came mainly to meet the traveling seagull. The area looks a bit seedy but not bad. Close to the center and at the same time separated from the hustle and bustle. And the city is fine.
6752,1720734,3,Aventuramenuda,31/12/2021,"Perfect area in to visit this beautiful city. It has filling and emptying. At this time, to refuel water, you have to open the stopcock that is on the ground, it is to prevent the tap from bursting with frost.

You can simply put your €6 fee with supply and disposal in an envelope with a car number in the mailbox at the house. Why can't those with the most expensive motorhomes do that?

You pay into a honest box, tip: add a paper with your number plate, so they know you have paid, we found our paper with a thank you at the windscreen next morning. Unfortunately there is a sign warning to make sure that all locks are shut before you go to bed :-( and to not let valuables in sight in the campervan and to turn your alarm on if you have got one. We still felt safe at night because there were 7 campervans on the site, but we didn’t dare to leave the campervan alone to wander into town at night, we took it in turns next day. Thanks to the authorities for the site - maybe it would be an idea to have a guard, the site is very popular and I am sure many people would happily pay a bit more for knowing that their belongings are safe."

6815,1312709,1,gwadjul,11/07/2021,"We had planned to spend the night there, given the number of camper vans that were parked there. But the bell of the church of the sanctuary got the better of our patience: it rings every 15 minutes and all night."
6815,1113146,4,Thenudrovers,07/11/2020,Didn't find it too sloping at all and ramps soon fixed that.  Bells every 15 minutes until 9.30pm and from 7am.  Almost as echo comes from others in the distance.  Still a great spot with lots of sights to see including the village up the hill.  Many motorhomes and caravans were parking across a number of bays.  The place is so quiet at the moment that this didn't seem to be a problem.
6815,1062672,4,molly95,21/09/2020,Good nights sleep but very sloping and only six places for motor homes all the rest quite short

Facilities are closed due to Covid-19."
6815,858921,4,JYE19,10/07/2020,"Parking near the Basilica. The place is very good. There are no services for ac. The public toilets in the car park closed due to the pandemic, although five minutes away there are some open right in the Basilica. Service area with restaurants, shops and basic necessities stores at 10 'in Jacinta Marto street. There are many fountains throughout the complex and the parking lot."
6815,793878,4,Mmmoustic,10/03/2020,"The place is impressive. For the landscaped area, the 6 places are occupied full time by cc and caravans + cars: no interest. We parked around and at night there is nobody, it's very quiet in early March. You can take the water from the fountains, drain the waste water on site."

Right in the action, basilica etc everything within walking distance; quiet nights; Great experience with many pilgrims and RVs, especially from Portugal. Picnic stations and drinking taps."
6815,718033,5,padraigl,10/10/2019,"This is not an Aire. Yes there are 6 dedicated motorhome parking bays which are large but on a slight hill.
There are NO services like you get on an Aire.
There is NO grey ground drain like on an Aire.
There is NO dedicated black WC drain like on an Aire.
There is NO dedicated fresh water tap like on an Aire.

There are many very large separate carparks here where motorhomes and caravans were parked.
Some motorhomes and caravans had a pipe from their grey drain directed into the carpark storm drains close to where they parked. Others were parked over these storm drains. 
Can't see why this is needed with the free toilets and showers.

Saw some people use the toilet block to empty their cassette.

There are many drinking taps around the parking areas. This is where motorhomers used watering cans to fill up.

The carpark is lit up at night.

Pros:
Free parking.
Free toilets and showers.
Large bins around the carpark.
Covered concrete picnic benches.
Some tree shade.
Local supermarket, cafe and bar.
Close to the Basilica and main square.

Cons:
None. This is a fantastic free parking area to visit Fatima.

The sanitary block is split into gender and is very large with toilets and showers.

The carpark is behind the main Basilica and main square. All shops, cafes and restaurants surround this area.
Aldi is 7 minutes walk away. 
The village where the children were born is 35 minutes walk away along a lovely path which also has the stations of the cross.

We had 3 very quiet nights here. 

Bugs/Mosquitoes. (They love us..)
We did not encounter any mosquitoes here. But we did encounter many flies."

Although there are not any motorhome facilities people were emptying cassettes in the toilet block. access was very good and suitable for all sizes.
We were a 5 minute walk from the sanctuary which was pretty awe inspiring and grand and well worth the visit."

Our welcome with Chantal was beyond friendly, we could choose our space
The toilets and showers were clean and the shower was hot. 
The animals walking around the entire place is so nice! 
There are a lot of long term guests and some of them didn't seem very pleased to have 'strangers' here. 
Overall, we had a good night and would recommend the place"
6985,2755447,5,Plusink,16/05/2023,"Very hospitable and easily received by Chantal. Very nice campsite with many animals. We were allowed to choose a spot ourselves and even had ponies in ""the garden"" Sanitary neat and clean. Recommended."
6985,2750533,5,philmc33,15/05/2023,"Old school campsite with lots of space. Chantal found us a nice place in the shade and showed us the drain-shower area (0.5€/8 minutes!). Dogs welcome, on a leash because animals are free (we had a friendly visit from a pony). possibility massage by Elodie (my wife delighted by her massage session sent me there). To arrive, prefer the path from the north. Address to remember"
6985,2743383,5,julieLynk,12/05/2023,A little corner of paradise surrounded by nature and animals. A great team that welcomes you. All necessary facilities. Marie's sangria are divine! Thanks again for this time.

Thanks to Elodie for her exceptional massages."

6985,2714033,5,vpx23,01/05/2023,Pleasantly quiet and spacious place. Very nice for children when the ponies or mini pigs walk past the mobile home. Massage absolute recommendation. Neighboring town with Intermarche and beautiful church square can be reached in 20 minutes on foot. Internet reception OK. Lovely again!
6985,2688488,5,joparker124,22/04/2023,Relaxed campsite with lots of space. There is a bar and a tent where massages are offered. Recommended
6985,2687468,5,gertruudsgroenebus,22/04/2023,Probably not everybody's cup of tea but definately ours! Absolute loose and relaxed atmosphere. You can park wherever you like. Who needs five showers? One per gender is enough. We parked on the left in the back and it was totally silent. We took nice walks in the neighbourhood.
6985,2685774,5,danieldada,21/04/2023,"Super I love it, I plan to live there 8 months a year"
6985,2684085,4,Hannedr,20/04/2023,"The campsite itself is a bit of faded glory, but the sanitary block is clean. There is electricity and water services. Also a nice bar. I had a massage in the tipi by Elodie, which is definitely recommended! The roads to it are ""agricultural"" and at times very narrow due to afforestation for our mobile home of 7.5x2.5x3.20."
6985,2683259,5,labourdetteisabelle,20/04/2023,"The ideal place to relax, space, a top team, thanks to Chantal and Eugène for their welcome, and to Marie who runs her little bar with gentleness and kindness! Animals to discover for children, toilets and sanitary facilities clean and maintained. A big thank you also to Élodie who offers massages and energy treatments, an extraordinary moment of letting go."
6985,2649521,5,jumpermarina,08/04/2023,"A fantastic and authentic place. There are horses, ponies, sheep, nature in its purest form and close to the town. A very free and respectful environment. We pay €10/day with electricity included. It has all the services and the hosts and everyone are super friendly. We will return without a doubt!"
6985,2634180,4,LuuuNA,01/04/2023,"the most pleasant place ever. that's how camping should actually be: uncomplicated, without pitches, quiet. we stay 4 nights instead of one as planned. I deduct one star for the sanitary facilities, which should be more professionally built and cleaner and not right next to the black water. I give a 6th star for Elodie, which offers professional Ayurveda massages."
6985,2631367,5,SanchesMaryse,30/03/2023,"more than an area, a small paradise in nature surrounded by orange trees, free animals (pony horses, pigs, chickens etc) Chantal is very caring for us, very kind, available. always ready to help more this year I have known the services of Elodie (massage - energy care - magnetism) only happiness - she is on top - very kind - do not hesitate to meet her"
6985,2629375,5,IntillaDavid,29/03/2023,"Very nice place at Chantal's, we stayed for a month, it was so quiet and calm. We were in a van and the showers (50cts for 8 minutes so plenty of time) were welcome =)"

6985,2567958,5,RobBradshaw,04/02/2023,"5 Stars. Chatal is friendly and helpful. €12 a night with electric is a bargain. 20 minute walk from supermarket in Moncarapacho and about 45 minutes walk to Fuseta. Uber to Fuseta costs less than €5.  We planned 2 nights here and stayed for 3 weeks. Its relaxed and friendly. Lots of nature around and horses, sheep, pigs etc roam free. There is a daily grocery van that turns up. We'll be back!"
6985,2559823,4,julia312,24/01/2023,"Very nice place and nice reception. If you don't need electricity and don't have a dog, you can almost stand by yourself. Very idyllic, the animals sometimes stand right in front of the camper in the morning. Unfortunately only one toilet and one shower per gender. Otherwise everything great!"
6985,2559554,5,pepone06,24/01/2023,"I recommend this family campsite, the reception by Chantal is very friendly, free and very large pitch with the animals roaming freely between the cc's it's a campsite to recharge your batteries. price 10€ without electricity. We will be back as soon as we are in the area again."
6985,2558451,5,Alexybebe,23/01/2023,"Quiet place in the middle of nature, loose animals that make the place special, the staff a 10 ♥️❤️♥️❤️"
6985,2557168,2,egoman,21/01/2023,"I had been looking forward to this place for a long time... the operators are really super nice and helpful. The entire course is on hilly terrain. When I tried to drive to the place recommended to me a little further down, I almost got stuck and had to reverse all the way out. At night some animal ran around on my camper, couldn't be driven away and sounded really scary. So I left at 3 a.m. Unfortunately, the sanitary facilities do not deserve this name. I'm sorry for this review, I think the project of the two ladies is great and the people there are really nice..."
6985,2553457,4,MarkJager,16/01/2023,"Very nice all those animals that run loose. Everything is quite basic, but works fine. Spots are not straight so you definitely need levellers."
6985,2540336,5,coolshark,03/01/2023,"Absolutely beautiful place with a lot of charm, between orange fields. Large meadow with a few trees, no narrow standing, everyone has space and the administrator is multilingual and can always be reached by phone. There are pitches with electricity but also without and the price of €10 is very cheap."
6985,2523413,5,maximezoe,17/12/2022,"Very relaxing setting, the regulars of the place are super nice, a lot of French people on site. The owner is adorable and her animals are beautiful and friendly. Admittedly the toilets are a bit outdated but have the merit of being there, it's always better than nothing! We will come back here with pleasure!"

6985,2358000,5,Sinapuro,10/09/2022,"It is a special place, transmits peace and tranquility. It is a very large ranch with space for nature and animals (you can see from horses to pigs). A Van, 2 people and electricity, 1 night cost us 10 euros. There are toilets and showers(0.5-8min). Chantal is very friendly and treated us very well. Stones us the opportunity to know the site."
6985,2353236,5,AldericPORTO,08/09/2022,"An exotic area with a false air of the Far West. Chantal took great care of us, a very pleasant stay. Clean sanitary facilities, shade, a swimming pool to cool off in... A nice break, we'll be back."
6985,2318638,5,Jaochavo,29/08/2022,"With Chantal ""no problem"", everything is made easy and as if you were at home. An ideal place to escape to tranquility, enjoy the surroundings and keep the children entertained."
6985,2317043,5,lonit,29/08/2022,"We arrived quite late and were welcomed very warmly. Our pitch and toilet were very clean. During the day small ponies and other animals run around, which we found very nice. After we couldn't use our car as usual because our house was broken into, Chantal lent us her own for the day. Everyone there was super friendly and we wish we could have stayed longer!"
6985,2281232,5,Ele.Bri,21/08/2022,"Picturesque place, without waste of being visited and being able to spend a night here among animals and nature. As soon as you arrive, you feel like in the Old West. Chantal is charming, without a doubt, we will return!"
6985,2267849,5,sarause,19/08/2022,"great parking, very large, shady spot, 12 euros a night with electricity. The personnel is very friendly. There are animals which makes it a very special place, I recommend 100%"
6985,2250331,5,javierdepro,16/08/2022,"Charming and different place, ideal to go with children, for the loose animals and the large space that there is. Very nice treatment and very quiet place, an oasis in the tourist bustle of the Algarve. We stopped for one night on the way out of the trip and repeated on the way back. We definitely recommend it"
6985,2201297,5,Vanlsd85,09/08/2022,"We stayed one night, it was perfect: calm and space at the rendezvous! Chantal is lovely. The children liked the animals (ponies, cats, pigs, sheep, ostrich) which were on the ground. The toilets are clean and it is possible to empty the water in the rooms and the chemical toilet from the truck. I recommend !"
6985,2133738,5,Al_Ma,27/07/2022,Unique and genuine place. We have felt very comfortable. Very good value for money. We will be back.

6985,2124170,5,titisurfeur,26/07/2022,"Very nice roots campsite on the farm (little ponies running free, cats everywhere) with an adorable and very accommodating welcome from Chantal. We even found some shade!! So ok the sanitary facilities are dilapidated (but it works) and the swimming pool is out of order at the moment (too bad with this heat) but frankly at 12€ per night electricity included I recommend."
6985,2073925,3,Betsy2022jandt,14/07/2022,The owner is trying here. We don’t know why it is like it is. It is pretty grim here. The swimming pool is disgusting and the whole site needs attention. That said it could be lovely. We spent a night here quiet and able to cycle to the beach. A shame …. It could be beautiful just needs some TLC - although 15 euros for a camper is a bit steep.
6985,2042683,5,VeganPixie,06/07/2022,"Such a special place. Chantal greeted us big a big smile and an open heart, she is the most accommodating and always happy to help, speaking fluent english. The location has an awesome rustic charm which personally I love. The space is huge so you have as much space as you like, animals are calm and friendly. Night time is very quiet. Highly recommended!"
6985,1998240,5,jessiDag,21/06/2022,"This place is a haven of peace with people who have their hearts on their sleeves. Our daughters loved the free-roaming ponies and the ostrich, they were even able to attend the training of a magnificent mare. It is a foundation that aims to buy back animals that need to be collected. Chantal is very kind and available and speaks several languages fluently. A big thank-you !"
6985,1977656,5,Karlchen_Camper,14/06/2022,"Everything is great! we stood here for one night, were welcomed very warmly and were allowed to stand where we wanted. We paid €10 with electricity. Showers cost 50 cents. All in all unbeatable. Great big area. If you expect posh, you are wrong here. Everything is a bit older, but we like it."
6985,1961231,3,AnaM8,09/06/2022,"€10 4 people and a van. Old campsite, a bit neglected. Lots of trees and animals that make it fun. Also lots of bugs. Curious for one or two nights, good reception."

You contribute to the life of the Parkinson's Disease Foundation by coming here. This allows patients to come for free stays (the trip being financed by the town hall of the patient's place of residence). I love it and it's good to be in a place that isn't looking for profit but for well-being."
6985,1762420,5,snoopykaihi,21/02/2022,"its not the place that makes an experience this or that, its usually the people who makes the difference, here everyone we meet was nice smailing and kind.
plenty of space, few animals going around like horses pigs and doves which is really nice.
we would definitely come again.
if you are a nomad and need internet, the wifi is only is very specific area and o.k.
Thank you."
6985,1746842,5,numericity,03/02/2022,"Two years in a row that we come to spend our winter in the sun. This corner of nature is ideal for a rest, to mock in this very beautiful region or to make friends. the price to date (February 22) is 10€ with 6A of electricity. although the amenities are spartan, it's still very clean. Tuesday and Friday mornings there are horse dressage exhibitions."
6985,1743702,5,janjose,29/01/2022,"Beautiful nature campsite but we had the wrong coordinates of this site and came to a very narrow road where the camper could pass with less than 5 cm and with the necessary scratches from the low hanging branches of the carob trees. We were with 2 campers and could only continue, turning was not an option .... you have been warned. Find the right coordinates!!"
6985,1731462,5,nathajero,10/01/2022,"This campsite is a lucrative association for Parkinson's disease, I recommend it if you like nature and animals, it is a very peaceful and friendly place.

6985,1724890,4,Marcske67,03/01/2022,"A pleasant somewhat dated campsite, but that is what makes it unique. Chantal is present in a cordial way, always has a kind word for the visitors. Friendly priced, beautiful rural places and lots of peace."

6985,1687546,5,Gribouille81,13/11/2021,"Very nice, rural and friendly. Among the animals, sheep, ponies, black pigs, horses and even an ostrich, Chantal is active from morning to night to satisfy her campers. 4 km away: Fuseta, its port, its beach and its saltworks and 2 km away: the village of Montcarapacho where we ate generously for cheap (8 euros drink, dessert and coffee)."
6985,1682604,5,TAMZEL,08/11/2021,"We were received very hospitable by Nicky, who gave us a whole tour of the site. It is very quiet here and the many animals give it real charm. There are a number of 'snowbirds' here, but also shorter term people. The showers are currently being refurbished and there are plans for larger sanitary facilities next year. We are very happy that we found this gem and will definitely come back! Oh yes, we also used the washing machines and they work great!"
6985,1621683,5,Katzk,02/10/2021,"We spent a super quiet night, very calm environment, with super cute farm animals, we were visited by super cute ponies! Our motorhome is autonomous, we don't need to use toilets and showers, so I can't rate that part! great for anyone who wants a quiet night."
6985,1594750,2,carthago69,20/09/2021,"5 stars for the peace and quiet and the friendliness of the owner. The wash house we used was at least 30 years old, neglected and we had to pay 50 cents for the shower (including the cold shower). In the last 2.5 weeks of our trip we have never seen such unworthy washrooms. You don't want to leave your dishes near the so-called sink, because I can't imagine when the cleaning agents were last used. The last maintenance of the fire extinguishers should have been 5/2012."
6985,1589073,5,juliaklossek,18/09/2021,"Cool Location with a great host. We got electricity, a shower filled clean water tank and emptied waste water. We also got visited by their little pony. Nice Spot to stay the night or longer!"
6985,1578678,5,socke09,14/09/2021,"Very cool and relaxed location for campers who appreciate the original life. CAUTION! Be sure to drive to this place from the west, all other paths are extremely narrow and from a height of about 2 meters you will scratch your cars. Happened to me ... and yet I come back here."
6985,1541035,5,SergioCattolo,02/09/2021,A haven of peace. We spent only one night on the trip itinerary but we would have spent more. Very large farm with trees and possibility of shade. Much privacy. The beautiful sunset. There are loose animals but they do not come close. You can tell that it needs a reform but the facilities are correct and the bathrooms clean. Lovely Chantal. We pay 10e / 1night 2p / 1furgo Recommended 100%

6985,1437960,5,Pantaleon71,11/08/2021,"Very quiet and at least curious place. It has just enough to be well and more if you are used like us to sleep in any corner of the road. The bathrooms are old but we find them very clean. The hot water in the showers works with € 0.50 for about 8 minutes, it takes two to shower, a good way to save energy. Otherwise everything is correct, good treatment."
6985,1435736,4,lopezandorra,10/08/2021,Different site. Not suitable for everyone. Excellent treatment. we stayed one night and our children made us repeat another. Has loose animals. There are people who live there regularly. I would repeat without hesitation

Good location for cycling the 4km to the beach. The 10.- are a bit too expensive, as campsites in the area with the same location offer significantly more (pool, shower, ...) and only charge 10.-."

If there is no nasie at the door, there is a contact phone number for the manager or ask a friend who is staying to help you. A strange and special place with reasons for Route 66 and handmade booths, very quiet. 8 euros without electricity. 10 euros with electricity. Hot water 0.50 cents."

6985,788735,4,ippaul,29/02/2020,"Place in nature, very peaceful. The reception was good. We paid 8 euros, including services, without electricity (because there were no pitches available). Most of the guests are French and seem to have stayed there for a long time or were regulars. The cleanliness of the services is acceptable. Showers are extra and cost 50 cents for about 7 minutes."
6985,782812,3,Bentond,19/02/2020,"We spent 6 nights here in a motorhome with dog. Quaint, quirky and very welcoming. No fixed plots. They fit you in around others. Had plenty of space. We chose not to use showers and toilets. Prefer mine. Dog had to be kept on lead because of all the livestock. Would come again."
6985,776663,4,Naow56,05/02/2020,"We spent the night there, very quiet with all the animals, perfect for those who love nature and the proximity to animals. Pig, hen, goose, horses, ostrich ... Paradise ?? 8th at night. 10th with electricity. Chantal is very kind and welcomes with oranges. You can shower at 50 cents for 7 minutes of hot water. It was really nice and exotic. I'm removing a star because the shower really should have been washed, and the bath rugs too .."

6985,772935,5,petifran1,26/01/2020,"Super welcome from Chantal, totally confident we left her our motorhome 50 days in dead land for 1.50 € per day. Very handy for flying to Faro. Camping to Fuseta station 4 km, Fuseta train to Faro then shuttle from Faro station to the airport, this for € 3.60 per person. That said I recommend this air of CC also for its large locations and the beautiful walks in the nearby orange groves."
6985,767044,3,Reisefreaks,10/01/2020,"Very pleasant parking space with great spaces. Unfortunately, the sanitary building is in urgent need of renovation ... and the left part of the space is still closed. Chantal is the good soul of the place that fulfills every wish. It is a little bad to walk with a dog .."
6985,766875,4,Mokca,10/01/2020,"Atypical place, full of surprises and very nice animals, especially black pigs having fun on our carpet in front of our Van. To underline the very good reception of Chantal who does what it takes to find you a place. Thank you !"
6985,759233,2,nanou57,29/12/2019,"apart from the reception of Chantal, area to avoid because the management is handled by a person who has the power to fire people who do not like him. Very dilapidated toilets that do not make you want to use them."

A very warm welcome by Chantal who speaks French and many other languages and offers you oranges. The pitches are large, calm. And all that 12 km from Tavira and 20 km from Faro. Fuseta and its small port and beach is 4 km away, great for jogging or cycling. Price 10 euros with services and electricity included. We are coming back next March."
6985,737861,4,ptor,03/11/2019,"The fair bathrooms, the quiet and peculiar place and Chant al very helpful. About 15 minutes from Olhao and another 15 from Tavira in summer I think that shade would be lacking."

6985,679023,3,maria24,06/09/2019,"We spent one night but I would not have stayed more ... a place far away and VERY left. The bathrooms could not be used as dirty as they were.

6985,650663,2,tritina,22/08/2019,"It was hard to find her. The owner told us that we were very far from Tavira, so we only asked to take a shower and he didn't like it. In the end we negotiate empty poty showers (€ 5 plus the shower sheet). Then the very kind woman came to tell us that we were not far from him that he had confused but we did not stay. The environment is very cool, but the bathrooms are very damaged and lack a good cleaning."

6985,621087,4,gpainhoa,12/08/2019,"Although the services are improvable, the friendliness of the owner and the environment make up for it.

No one seemed to be breaking the behaviour rules, as it was 27 degrees at 7 o’clock we moved on.  Only downside for us was getting out of the city onto our route.  Don’t know if it was the sat nav or the new one way systems."

The last street before the parking space is incredibly steep. If you have to stop at the traffic light, it is difficult to get out again. I wouldn't want to do it again."

It is behind a sports center, the problem is that just behind in the park the young people start making bottles with loud music from 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. we had to go because with the music it was unbearable to sleep. Good for visiting the city but impossible to sleep, not advisable."

The tap with the screw fitting loses all pressure when someone uses the the push button tap. We found it easier to walk up the road than through the park in order to get to town.
7043,1428085,5,jesusmmc,09/08/2021,"Very good area. A shame that people believe that this is a campsite, knowing that the police can come and fine for breaking the rules. We have arrived and parked next to another camper, he immediately reproached us for having approached us. They wanted to have space, for that go to a campsite, you have to think about occupying the minimum space for the AC or camper that may come. Otherwise, perfect."

The one on the left has a tap with a thread and a handle, and two manholes, only the one on the left, the one with painted ""WC"" is the one for emptying black, not the other. The latter was full of excrement, we are going to use the common services with a little more civility"

Tip: Be careful when driving west! my sat nav (which actually knows the altitude of the car) almost sent me right after the exit from the parking lot to the right and then down sharply to the left into a steep narrow street, but below is a very low underpass and there is no turning possibility for something bigger , Backwards it goes only with a lot of momentum and smoking clutch up and then someone has to stop the traffic on the main road. So look up ;-)"

The only problem is that the sewage tap did not work, and the tap to refill water in the caravan is a fountain-type push button, it was somewhat difficult for us."
7046,2988802,4,Framboisine330,19/07/2023,Convenient because close to the city center. Partially shaded places.
7046,2985034,5,silvigom,18/07/2023,"It's great, a very quiet area, with shade and they allow you to take out tables, awnings, etc. Highly recommended to spend the night in Astorga."
7046,2973823,5,JanundAnja,16/07/2023,"Good, quiet place, but very brightly lit and little shade. Even when it's full, there's still enough space to stand on the edge. Nice place with a good selection of bars and restaurants in Plaza España."
7046,2965485,5,Carlosb1,15/07/2023,Good place to visit the city with loading and unloading of water. very quiet at night and shady during the day. Thanks to the City Council.

7046,2868817,5,Paichi,18/06/2023,"We arrived on Friday and there was no space, but there are several spaces around the bullring where you can park without problems, in fact the civil guard passed by and said nothing. The area is yes, it's not one of the best I've been to, but it's fine and in a place where you sleep very well as it's a quiet place. The tourist area is more or less 1 km away, in a walk you can get there well."
7046,2847467,4,KellyyMiguel,12/06/2023,It's not bad... Unpaved ground and the toilet cleaning faucet doesn't work... Otherwise very good... Other town halls could copy
7046,2761788,4,SimonF15,18/05/2023,Spent one night. Didn’t use the facilities. Shaded area quiet except for the nearby Air Ambulance if it takes off. It landed whilst we were there but didn’t hear it after that. Walk into town centre took about 15 minutes. Gaudi palace is a must see!
7046,2749651,4,rous80bu,14/05/2023,You can empty water (grey and black). There are some trees that give some shade. Quiet area except for the fact that it is next to a sacyl helicopter center and there was a lot of noise when we were there

7046,2669493,5,D.Feeney,14/04/2023,Perfect for a short stop. We emptied black and grey wasted and refilled our water - we aware there is no way to connect a hose. Walked around the bull ring briefly to exercise the dog and continued our journey
7046,2657314,4,bellcurr,10/04/2023,"good place to spend the night and empty, the only bad thing is that the filling has no thread and is the button (which you have to push it to stop) that does have a lot of flow. Very quiet site."
7046,2647226,4,xillao,07/04/2023,"The area was full, but we managed to park on the side, surrounding the bullring. We miss collectors to separate and recycle the glass. Thanks to the Council of Astorga for the area."

7046,2644530,2,Gordi21,06/04/2023,"The filling tap does not have a thread, a lot of water is lost when filling as the hose does not fit. There is another tap with a thread but it has no water. The GPS track has taken us 400 meters from the actual location. We found it looking for the bullring."
7046,2644133,3,air081,06/04/2023,"Enabled area, it is not an area, it has a space prepared for the discharge of water and filling of clean water without thread and with a button and then next to it there is a level field to park, without delimiting or fencing or anything. It has some traffic since it is right next to the road that goes to the sports venues of the town. In addition, it is also in front of the hangar of the medicalized helicopter in the area. Despite this, we slept well, we were like 20 motorhomes there."
7046,2642504,5,jolynol,05/04/2023,Close to the town so good for visiting it as it's very beautiful.

7046,2623688,4,bkb,25/03/2023,"Area near the bullring. Parking on dirt and grass. Clean and functional service area. Behind the area, there is the take-off area for civil protection helicopters, but does not seem to work at night. Near downtown. The cathedral and the Episcopal Palace of Gaudi are really worth the visit."
7046,2615205,4,M_F_A,19/03/2023,"Spacious, very quiet and flat to spend the night. Unfortunately the black tap doesn't work and some people use the clean tap to clean the pot. The clean faucet is not threaded"
7046,2610915,4,airwolf84,15/03/2023,Clean place and free services. Center about 1 km. Earth ground and next to the rescue helicopter take-off area and next to a university residence so there are a few car passages in front.

7046,2583705,4,jbbernabe,19/02/2023,"Area well located and perfect to spend the night. Spacious, quiet, silent and illuminated, which gives a feeling of security. With emptying of gray and black. The clean water faucet worked, but the chemical water faucet did not. I would repeat to spend the night."
7046,2533996,2,Arto2018,30/12/2022,"Everything muddy when it rains. We didn't like it, we drove on. Maybe ok for emergencies."
7046,2513731,1,ANGELMORAN,05/12/2022,"Not only is there no water in the cleaning tap, there is also no water in the potty one, shameful..."
7046,2477862,2,Abrah,01/11/2022,"Recommended place to spend the night and not deviate from the highway. You park on the ground, if it rains everything is full of puddles. Clean faucet does not work, so you must use the faucet to clean the potti (no comments) You can empty gray and black. It is very abandoned, you don't want to visit the town. a pity"
7046,2460113,1,salvadorcabrera,24/10/2022,"the correct parking spaces but the area leaves much to be desired, the filling tap does not work and it is next to where helicopters land, not recommended"
7046,2436927,4,Juhy,11/10/2022,"Perfect for the night, very quiet. Walk to the town in 15min and a supermarket in 4min walking. Bad water tap."

7046,2422094,2,ouzyyy,04/10/2022,"Ample parking, very flat, very quiet. 15 minutes from the center on foot. Clean environment, but ugly. The water faucet is still broken."
7046,2329743,1,Elduayen,01/09/2022,"Very abandoned area, the water tap as other people have commented is still broken, it does not seem to me that it is close to the center. We stayed because we needed to spend the night and the night was quiet."
7046,2327470,4,garagara-,01/09/2022,A very quiet caravan area to sleep close to the city. I thought it was the best car park to sleep in Astorga. Cleansed. Flat. The views are not very pretty but it is practical.
7046,2318057,3,blor,29/08/2022,"That's a long walk to the center, very quiet night, but the service area needs a review from time to time from the City Hall. both technical maintenance and cleaning, that lss things. when they are heavily used. They tend to break down and the drinking water tap is out of use. They don't help me if they put a label on the other that it is drinkable, because the potis (WC) are usually cleaned in that"
7046,2317697,4,BraisOtero,29/08/2022,"a motorhome area very well located right next to the town, it has a shaded area and is quite level, what I like least is the sewage emptying tank"
7046,2313094,3,larinha84,28/08/2022,Overnight area. Without any nearby attraction. To see the town we got off in the 6.4m campervan and parked without any problem in the streets (even though they were parties). The municipal swimming pool area is perfect for resting and going with children. Eye! Mandatory caps in all pools (also outdoor).
7046,2310051,3,jerome6769,27/08/2022,Thank you to the city for making us an area. Convenient 20 minutes to the cathedral and palazio GAUDI. Otherwise a bit of a busy road. Question services we have not filled up with water. Single faucet that squirts everywhere. We have seen people put the tap entirely in the evacuation of the cassette!
7046,2298057,5,Carmengh,25/08/2022,"Quiet area and close to the town, we spend one night, during the day visit the town and in the afternoon municipal swimming pools that are great and cheap."
7046,2279880,5,Saseali,21/08/2022,"Very good area, quiet and a short walk from the town, there are large trees that provide shade. The very beautiful cathedral and the beautiful Gaudí palace and what to say about the cooked maragato, spectacular."
7046,2279870,3,SyFri,21/08/2022,Thanks to the city for this opportunity.
7046,2275924,4,noahspc,20/08/2022,"Very quiet area. This is the second time I stay there and very well. This time, for the dates it was full. The water fountain this time was not working. You have to take a walk to the center but it is comfortable. And there is a DIA supermarket super close."
7046,2272662,4,cristianlaraxe,20/08/2022,"Very good motorhome area with all the services, quiet even though it is somewhat far from the center, highly recommended for an overnight stay, we will repeat without a doubt."
7046,2267822,5,DADACONCA,19/08/2022,Excellent parking also shaded in front of the Plaza de Toro. With drinking water loading and unloading. Quiet because it is internal to the road. We definitely sleep here.
7046,2259008,4,HappyHarry,18/08/2022,"Stayed one night, very quiet. Fresh water tap not functioning, otherwise all ok. Visited local church, well worth it. Nice atmosphere in the town. Thank you."
7046,2255124,5,Esther_159,17/08/2022,"Quiet area, we have been very comfortable. There are enough caravans and campers so you feel in a safe area. There is an emptying area for gray and black water. 100% recommended if you are going to visit Astorga."
7046,2238556,4,ramfarre,14/08/2022,"Astorga is worth a visit from any point of view, so the motorhome area should be in accordance with what the city offers. Cleaning, filling and emptying area that can be improved with very little investment and marking the places for motorhomes would be an option for improvement. Otherwise the city is 15/20 minutes from the area, impossible to get lost."
7046,2226072,4,DolorsyJuan,12/08/2022,"good site, next to Astorga bullring, with filling and drainage services. we have found some remnants of packaging, but generally clean. Astorga is worth visiting, many restaurants and quality tapas bars. quiet night without disturbance. with sporadic police presence that gives more security. Good for the town hall."
7046,2215528,4,joshi_es,11/08/2022,"We have slept very peacefully. No noise. Basic filling and emptying services, correct. Some afternoon shade. A 15 minute walk to the historic center of the city. The town hall, beautiful."
7046,2183623,3,guti1974,06/08/2022,"Quiet place to sleep and quite close to town. Some shaded areas. The clean water faucet did not work. Although the place is a bit ugly, it is appreciated that the city council thinks of us."
7046,2174072,2,Bhelix,04/08/2022,"Pretty gross area, dirty discharge area and taps work like ass. The ugly place, next to the road and everything quite abandoned. It saves him to be on the way to Madrid."
7046,2171590,3,lafurgomolona,04/08/2022,"A good place to spend a single night, we found that there was no drinking water. The place was a bit dirty, the garbage containers were very close and it smelled bad."
7046,2144929,4,Minotavrvs,30/07/2022,"We stopped in passing to spend the night. The parking lot filled up at night but on the way there is a street with a walk next to green areas that is good for sleeping. The drinking water tap did not work, but the black water tap did. In use for emptying black and gray water. Organic garbage containers and containers in the area."
7046,2007043,3,viveloscolores,24/06/2022,"Quiet and level site, although it is not pretty, it can be said that it is a good place to pass through. A day supermarket 10 minutes and I can say little more about this site."
7046,1995718,4,TommyCaldu,20/06/2022,"Quiet and beautiful place. Ideal to know the city. Cathedral, old town etc. We ate at a restaurant. in Plaza Eduardo de Castro -recommendable- Thanks to all the people of Astorga and its City Council"

7046,1907108,3,db19,22/05/2022,"Quiet place with some shade, slightly neglected disposal, but functional. The drinking water extraction is difficult because the tap has no connection for the hose and you have to hold the trigger. 10 minute walk to town, super works, charming center."
7046,1890395,3,Bianchi34,14/05/2022,A very quiet area well leveled with depth for all types of motorhome
7046,1883143,4,alferez,11/05/2022,"Very interesting city for visits, especially the Cathedral is beautiful. In the area we have been very comfortable, the night very quiet and with all the services working. I recommend."

7046,1858535,2,Joserram,28/04/2022,"Very far from the town and without water. Neither to clean, nor to clean the Poty. You can sleep peacefully."
7046,1858318,3,jomaduga,28/04/2022,"Quiet place to sleep. Without water. Level parking lots. Few seats. Of course, 15 minutes walk from a beautiful city."

7046,1854525,4,Salva1960,26/04/2022,"I spent the night of April 25 in this area. Level, with gravel and wide, without delimiting. The clean water faucet does not work, without water, nor does the gray one. Abandoned service. Lack of maintenance. Next to the bullring, 15 min. walking to the Cathedral. It was the day of Santo Toribio, patron saint of Astorga. Nice traditional Castilian music festival with the Maialde group."
7046,1840834,3,Tierras_Insolitas,20/04/2022,"The area has fairly level squares. Near the center (about 10 minutes walk to the cathedral). As a negative point, there is no water in the clean water tap or in the WC (they could have this type of maintenance). Otherwise very quiet night."
7046,1837235,3,Malvern59,19/04/2022,Stayed here 1 night convenient for walking into town. No water available only drainage and toilet waste. Next to the emergency heliport so noisy during the day
7046,1836654,2,ariveiro,18/04/2022,"A place to get out of trouble, lousy services, the sewage tap without water, the stench was disgusting. The clean water tap, to press and acts 2 seconds. And to put up with it you have to have breakfast, and as if that were not enough, it does not have a bagel. SUSPENSE FOR THAT AREA, walking to the center of the city still has a while"
7046,1831200,3,guau,17/04/2022,Quiet place to sleep. Lawn area. I don't know how far it is from downtown because we were only there to sleep.
7046,1824527,3,Blotosfera,15/04/2022,"The terrain is quite uneven. The toilet discharge area was clogged (4/15/22) and the water did not work to clean. The clean water load does work, but it can lead to confusion that someone cleans the chemical with that intake. The city council should only fix it. The area is 15 minutes from the historic center."
7046,1810025,3,mchicoc,08/04/2022,A few months ago when I was there there was a rubber connected to the tap and there was no problem using it. Obviously someone has understood that they could take it away and now you need an adapter to get water. Threadless faucet. Otherwise quiet and level.
7046,1781288,4,lasarastark,12/03/2022,"Good site, without much charm but functional, level and fairly quiet. Good services except for the fountain type water intake but if you are well prepared you can use it. In 10 minutes you are at the entrance to the historic center, it is not far at all."
7046,1766924,3,Natas,26/02/2022,"Great place to stand and explore the city. You stand behind the bullfighting arena, you don't see this in the pictures. Good discharge and refilling."
7046,1759974,3,lbroks,19/02/2022,"The site is fine, but it was impossible for us to load water, one tap could not be opened and the other needed a clamp to connect the hose. It is quite far from the center of town. We slept here but to visit the town we parked in a car park next to the wall"
7046,1758222,5,Boch51,17/02/2022,"Great location, flat and quiet parking 10 minutes walking from the historic center and the palace/cathedral. I don't understand why people complain that is far from the center... It's a small city indeed but that's a really convenient area which is FREE with all services. However the fresh water tap wasn't working in mid february."
7046,1752942,3,Eddie12,11/02/2022,"A bit far from town. Quiet night. Small problems with the taps - the one for clean water is unusable (conical tip, point down, impossible to connect a hose even with a serflex). - for the cleaning of the cassettes, provide a pair of pliers."
7046,1747682,5,johnandkellie,04/02/2022,It’s just like the photos. You can park closer to the city during the day though. There were small cars passing all night.
7046,1742794,5,Juanita2.0,28/01/2022,"Very good, a little noisy due to the passage of workers from the town hall, but safe and quiet."
7046,1729864,4,fatimaiglvil,08/01/2022,"I had a very quiet night, I was en route north so I arrived at night and left very early. The only drawback is that the cleaning faucet needs an adapter because it is a fountain faucet without a thread."
7046,1719799,5,Alina-Mihaela,30/12/2021,"Quiet place, behind the bullring and quite flat to spend the night. We arrived quite late and it was almost full, about 12 AC. The city is very beautiful, I recommend the Gaudi palace, € 6 per person."
7046,1705805,5,sanchez.mercado,07/12/2021,"Visit in the middle of the bridge fleeing the storm, behind the bullring, made of gravel, somewhat sheltered from the cold, under two large lampposts. They enter about 10/12 AC, for the emptying is quite good, garbage can and recycle and the town about 20 minutes walk. Thanks to the city council for putting it up and maintaining it for free."
7046,1670046,4,mchicoc,30/10/2021,"Quiet, quiet, and level. Many seats and the tap that is push-button now has a rubber attached. Astorga amazing to visit, Thanks for the facilities."
7046,1645317,4,NJMC,15/10/2021,"Very quiet place about 20 min walk from the center. The water services well. We spent one night accompanied by several ACs (in my opinion, a bit lonely to be alone). We did not visit the center due to lack of time, but it remains to be pointed out to return to see Gaudí's Palace, the Roman and Chocolate Museum, its wall ... and more charm. Thanks to the City Council for their effort. Good trip."

7046,1620722,4,JulioMM,01/10/2021,"Perfect place to visit Astorga, five minutes from the old town, behind the bullring. Wide, flat, with trees, water supply and emptying of the cassette. The walls and the cathedral are very interesting. Gaudí's palace is spectacular, not to be missed. And the pastry shops. We have been very comfortable two nights at the end of September."
7046,1617738,3,NachVanLife,30/09/2021,A bit far from the center. Until the night there is a little movement of vehicles. The area is neglected. Free

7046,1601777,4,Unicore,23/09/2021,"Free parking space on the outskirts of the city, but the adjacent streets seem to be quite busy, the night was quite restless. Old town within walking distance, disposal on site perfectly, also garbage cans available. Around the corner there is a large sports complex and a beautiful park.

7046,1521045,4,vitoperruna,27/08/2021,"Quiet, spacious and shaded by trees. A bit far from the center. We only stopped to visit the city. I saw a show by a couple of families with large ACs pulling out tables, chairs and awnings between the two ACs while other ACs ate inside.

7046,1510605,3,Lunatica66,25/08/2021,"All free services, a little left in the hand of God, on the outskirts of Astorga. Park and rest, observation a maintenance could do you wrong."

It seems a bit isolated but we felt safe and had a good nights sleep until 7am. Plenty of people walking their dogsled.

There are full services excluding electricity.
The grey waste is a normal ground drain.
The black WC drain is 300mm off the ground with a plastic cover and it's own tap which is missing the handle and is not working anyway. (*Don't lift the plastic cover with the rocks on top beside the black WC drain!). The drain pipe is large but it tends to splash about a bit when emptying the cassette.
The fresh water tap which is a push button has no threads and you will need a rubber connection or a bucket to transfer the water. It has great pressure.
There are large bins at the front of the carpark.

There is a Maxi Dia 5 minutes walk away with the best tasting cooked chicken in Spain.
The cathedral was just closing when we arrived but the outside is worth the visit. It has no prayer chapel. Gaudi's designed Episcopal Palace is worth a visit for €5.
This is also a Camino town and we found the food prices were on the expensive side for a Camino town even away from the center. They were more touristy prices.

On a Wednesday morning before 7am we were woken with what sounded like a generator. Got out to look and they were filling the fuel tanks in the helicopter compound.  
This is also the first time we have experienced a van parked so close that our open windows were touching eventhough there was loads of space around!!!! Heard about it but never experienced it...."

7050,1171808,4,knaussudwind,11/04/2021,"Very calm and quiet place at night. A walk along the Asma River joins him with the town. I do not give it 5 stars because it only has 3 level seats, we were able to use one with our caravan, but if you arrive late you stay inclined even using chocks. They should adapt more level squares on terraces like the current ones."
7050,1151440,2,Sucellos,14/03/2021,"It's a shame, that being in such an impressive site, the services leave much to be desired. two equal and flat taps that are together in which there is no way to connect a filling hose. so that the pot is cleaned in any of them, who fills clean water later? the discharge registers are in the same hole, gray and black water. It's a shame, because it's so pretty"

7050,203065,4,Robertocampo,15/10/2017,"It is a good place, quiet and well cared for. The park that is next to it and the river are very good. The bad thing is that at night there is some additional light and some parking space since there are only 3. Then, another problem is that when there is a football match in the field that is stuck, the influx of people makes entry difficult and , people occupy the service site and they are not very good either"

Beautiful walks and the small fishing village of Escarabote nearby. The nearby beach has showers in the summer. The most suitable and quiet places in the back. Although there is a queue during the morning when emptying the grays, no problem. Thank you very much Boiro!"
7060,3186157,3,tata13,20/08/2023,"The place is fine for a couple of days. As the colleagues comment, the drainage area is at the exit, which makes it difficult to maneuver. The only thing is that the place is small and we have to respect each other. The squares are delimited with pivots. Please don't be so selfish and hard-faced to invade another teammate's square because I want to open my awning and mount my entire arsenal. More empathy with others."
7060,3167622,4,garcheto,17/08/2023,"Perfect area to go with children, the beach in front and a very large park with zip lines and ramps, plots not very large but you can take out the awning."
7060,3159195,3,Adricollage,16/08/2023,we found places and the area was good. The bad: the pibotes that separate the squares and the difficulty to park. Another problem that they should solve: leaving the area because the unloading area is at the exit.
7060,3133478,5,LAXIENA,13/08/2023,Very good area. We spent 2 nights very well. THANKS to the Council of Boiro for this place.

7060,2956232,5,choquito,12/07/2023,"I see many negative comments about washing the cassette and loading water. It is true that it is very poorly indicated. The fountain tap is for loading water and where the barrier is, on the left on the grass, there is a chest that is it stands up and has a small hose that is for rinsing the cassette They could point it out because it has been like this for years and only those of us who have gone several times know"
7060,2913143,1,Minox,01/07/2023,"It's not AC, it's a motorhome parking. When you arrive, the barrier opens for you by reading the vehicle's license plate without awarding you a space, if there is no space (they don't indicate it anywhere) call so that they open the barrier and leave. If you enter with The idea of having your space for 24 hours is wrong, the moment you leave for any reason another can occupy your space without any problem, that is, it is a PARKING."
7060,2859921,3,RamonPirlo,16/06/2023,Wide and level area surrounded by picnic areas and playgrounds on the beachfront. Shade is missing without it being necessary to remove an awning
7060,2817362,3,Jocarr,03/06/2023,"Ok area, little space, but fatal water services. The vomitous, dirty and clogged sewage, and the same source of water to replace and clean the poti."
7060,2771560,5,djmdawson,21/05/2023,Great location. Cheap. Clean. Yes it may be outdated but what definitely worth a stop. We stayed for 2 nights in May and it was busy but the local area wasn’t too bad. There are hundreds of restaurants and bars. Just be mindful of opening times. Laundrette close and showers on the beaches
7060,2743488,5,SBusje,12/05/2023,"Parking on grass or asphalt. You can't hear the street. All clean. Thank you. For overnight stays of one day, tap on maximum days and deduct the days individually, otherwise 2 overnight stays will automatically be booked. At the entrance, the barrier opens directly. When exiting, drive in front of the barrier, pay at the terminal, drive back briefly, then the license plate is recognized and opens with a slight delay"

now priced at €6 per 24 Hrs. barriers and payment worked well. Great cafe/bar nearby."
7060,2496044,1,PhilHall909,15/11/2022,"Not good. Supply and disposal inadequate. Barrier opens when driving in without a ticket. When driving out, it does not open and you have to take a ticket. Pitches are also not pretty and are separated by small concrete pillars that make maneuvering difficult."
7060,2398848,4,klauscamper,24/09/2022,the service area for the drainage outlet needs to be improved. the parking lot is very good and the area too. I have been using it for years.
7060,2392604,1,Frankiti,21/09/2022,"Fatal, possibly the worst area in all of Spain, a real disaster, the drains and taps make no sense at all, the pivots on the ground ?????? And to top it off the barrier to exit does not work."
7060,2387789,4,gaetan14,20/09/2022,"Very good place for those who love the beach, for emptying it's a bit weird emptying the toilets It's the blue plate after the exit barrier. There's another plate under the panel to the right of the input c, to rinse the cassette there is a pipe provided for that"
7060,2359156,1,JSomer,10/09/2022,"The only good thing is the beach next to it, they have put some 10 cm high concrete pivots to separate the spaces and it is easy to step on them with the wheels, there is only one tap for both water and for washing potis, the sewage drain is on the ground, it is under the motorhome and you have to move it, it is a heavy plate, the license plate reader did not work and I had to call to get out"
7060,2338625,5,Katebmorris,04/09/2022,"Great location and stunning views.  Perfect for cycling, walking and the fabulous beaches.  Two excellent restaurants a few metres away.

7060,2271502,3,bourneufJo,20/08/2022,area with somewhat narrow places the emptying and filling are at the exit of the area so it is not practical you block everything.. the emptying ground needs to be reviewed large holes and very uneven and the water filling is not practical you are close to town and the beach.

7060,2168143,4,tusy02,03/08/2022,"Very good place, ideal to go with children, but without signage of where the potty is emptied and the tap to rinse it..., although it is right on the other side. For the rest, a perfect place, near the beach and 5 minutes from the town on foot and quite correct plots in terms of size, if the neighbor doesn't take care of you... hehehe. Price more than correct. €6.07"
7060,2138612,4,lolostralien,28/07/2022,"Super location facing the sea. A few minutes from downtown Boiro. For the price hard to find better. Regulars stay for months. Negative point, no shade."
7060,2067148,3,martaxsd,13/07/2022,"Emptying and water intake at the exit, an uncomfortable place. Crowded, without shadows in the squares, we were very hot. You have the beach in front and next to it a very large park for families and space for tables to eat."
7060,2064837,4,ainabasa,12/07/2022,"A quiet area with a great location. Grass pitches. There is a park with zip lines next door for children and a park with shadows to walk, ideal for dogs.

It has an area with tables to eat and two parks next to it. To put some downside is that the exit fence closes soon and the tap of the source is to press. Be careful with the pivots on the ground that delimit the squares. We will repeat without hesitation!"
7060,1814229,2,unbalconnoche,10/04/2022,"Area right in front of the beach, with a couple of bars nearby. Squares delimited by criminal cement pivots difficult to see when maneuvering. Emptying area at the exit, and it is difficult to find the black one, it is a chest before the blue barriers. If they charge they should give decent services."
7060,1761153,5,mlosvis,20/02/2022,"Excellent area, central, next to the beach and restaurants and playgrounds. The negative: cement pivots delimiting the squares, very dangerous and a messy payment system. You must register registration when entering and select and pay days of stay. It says maximum 1, but nevertheless it allows you to pay up to 3. If you don't register yourself when you enter, you have problems when you leave. The fence closes fast."
7060,1741348,4,Ankow6,25/01/2022,"The setting is beautiful and well cared for, with the beach in front and integrated into a park. Attached to the road, but on these dates (even Saturday night) it was totally quiet. The cement pivots are quite criminal and hardly visible. The unloading area is in the middle of the exit and the detector opened the barrier for us while we maneuvered, we had to call the phone to get out"

7060,1592952,1,MaryPer,19/09/2021,"The cement kids don't seem to me even half normal what they have to divide the plots, that you catch one with the wheel of the motorhome and you get the misfortune. to get out ... you have to do it where the water is discharged, so if a car is unloading and another wants to leave, they have to wait. The restaurant across the street all afternoon with loud disco music."
7060,1590001,1,SalvaCastilla,18/09/2021,"Signs throughout town warning that the only place to park ACs is in this area. You get there and there's not even room for a pin, vehicles piled up next to each other. Another hostile town, I'm going to the next one where they treat me better."

7060,1516571,5,Almudena09,26/08/2021,Great payment area in the middle of town and in front of the beach. We spend one night and the price is about € 6 a day. Clean place and next to a park to walk the dogs. Good atmosphere and quiet.
7060,1510032,4,LoveLiberte,25/08/2021,"Very cool and quiet area, very familiar"
7060,1487396,5,Svp116887,20/08/2021,"Extraordinary common area, large playground next door for the little ones, quiet night and the beach 50 meters away. showers on the beach and toilets (very neglected) the center 20 minutes walk"
7060,1486439,4,LauG2,20/08/2021,"Very well located area in front of the beach. Next to it there is a park, with a nice little lake. It is near the center of town and in front there is a beach bar where you can eat well! Nearby there is another restaurant called Touliña in which the service and food is outrageous! As for the services, they are not at all well indicated or located."
7060,1480738,5,Chusete,19/08/2021,"Ideal for family. In front of the beach, next to a beach bar, it has a shady picnic area, there are swings, an area for a walk along the river and public toilets on the beach itself. The only downside that I see is the abuse that some users carry out by taking out awnings, chairs, tables, etc. and other users who park directly outside the designated spaces ""because I'm worth it."""
7060,1463474,3,jonitxu,15/08/2021,"The area is in a beautiful setting, one step away from the beach and a great playground. The services need an urgent improvement, to empty or fill you block the entrance and exit, the places are not well delimited and although at the entrance it says that the max. it's 24 hours, everyone says it's 72 hours. An area in that environment is welcome, but certain improvements are urgent."
7060,1441232,4,txinor,11/08/2021,"To the previous comment, say that it contributes little to the area itself. Boiro has made a good area, with failures when placing the sewage discharge. The price per day is correct, the site is in front of a quiet beach without waves or currents, ideal for children Next to a park so that they can play without risk The places are delimited by pivots and there is a lot of space between the motorhome"
7060,1418296,4,patri.ac,07/08/2021,"The weather was bad and on the 1st night there were only 4 of us, and on the 2nd the weather was slightly better and there were a few more of us. In good weather and full it must be difficult to maneuver. the park next door is spectacular for children and a little over 5 years with a lot of obstacles and tests. the beautiful scenery. what I did not like the road noise at 5 in the morning seems the m30 of Madrid"
7060,1413032,3,Javi_Coyanza,06/08/2021,"Excessively narrow places, with no one to manage or receive more than a machine to pay. The phenomenal setting the fairly regular area"
7060,1376686,4,Van_der_van,29/07/2021,Highly recommended area. Part of grass and part tarred. Narrow but long pitches. Extraordinary location just 50 meters from the beach. It has a playground with zip lines. You pay by card at the machine and you can stay up to 3 days. No toilets. We have spent two very quiet nights there in a van and forward.
7060,1370949,1,ivanpinzales,27/07/2021,"More than an overnight acs area, it is an ""urban"" area where there are people who think they are on a campsite and even cook grilled sardines outside or set up decathlon tents for their ""services"". very bumpy and muddy driveway. somewhat sloppy and with a camp feel. located next to the beach of Boiro."
7060,1334555,2,ViajeroVallecano,17/07/2021,"We were long ago when it was an area for 10 motorhomes, today there are more than 40, which makes us crowded and with difficulties to maneuver. No control, which means that there are motorhomes out of the square, making movement even more difficult."
7060,1333252,3,IreChi,17/07/2021,"The area is very beautiful, in front of the beach and next to a very fun children's area and walking areas. You can walk to town. We recommend it but the worst thing is that the area has very narrow squares and if it gets full it is difficult to maneuver. In addition, the squares are separated by wooden logs that are dangerous for the wheels of the motorhome. We think it can be improved for what is charged."
7060,1256789,4,guiomar,15/06/2021,Good place next to the beach and good shade of pine trees. The worst maneuvering within the area due to its narrowness.
7060,1247714,5,Taniarc_87,11/06/2021,"We love this area, the squares are small and the services can be improved, but the quality / price ratio is perfect. It costs € 6.07 and you have to fill water, empty gray and black in a box near the sidewalk. It is on the beach, a playground on one side and a sports park on the other. Very well located, close to everything."
7060,1208161,1,carlos110978,20/05/2021,"It is a business of the politucuchos of the town. They charge you for nothing. Of course, in the entire town AC parking is forbidden, you can imagine that in order to go to checkout. If the car park is not closed or has sewage, gray water is out of service and a tap of the pressure is out of order, as you do not have the appropriate adapter, it is useless. I recommend stopping in the neighboring towns, they are more grateful and welcoming"
7060,1191042,1,viri,10/05/2021,"It always seemed like an area of ten to me. Currently the barrier and the collection machine works very well. Like parking, excellent. But the services in poor condition and since they charge you € 6.07, they should at least be fine. If it rains it floods and you can't empty the pot. A shame because the site is spectacular"
7060,1176247,4,Abrah,19/04/2021,"Area a bit abandoned by the town hall and that is paid, tap tap and very poorly defined parking, needs an update. The location is unbeatable and especially if you go with children, because of the parks that surround the area. That's a 10 to the town hall. I advise you to enjoy the two hospitality establishments that are next door, good quality and price."
7060,1170269,3,enriquesendra,08/04/2021,"Area finally open. The site is very good, next to the beach, a playground for children, also exercises for the elderly, with a walk in a small forest. Payment area € 6 / day. Upon arrival, the barrier opens automatically and then you have to pay at the entrance panel, being able to choose between 1/2 or 3 days. Gray water drainage right at the outlet, and water recharging point in the same place. The sewage is another song, at the exit and outside the area a racket with a rope to empty, and at 10 m another manhole with a hose to clean, as there are no instructions, as if a partner does not come out to explain to you, as if it were a riddle . The squares a little fair and with some semi-buried pivots that are not seen. Anyway, thanks to the city council for the service, but it is a shame that before doing things they do not get advice."
7060,1165942,5,meganechopi,04/04/2021,"Awesome area, it's super cool, huge park for children with zip lines, slides etc, etc, you pay €6 for water service, and discharge, it says it's closed but it's open since we were there three days ago, highly recommended... .."
7060,1152494,5,Joserram,16/03/2021,"Very good site. €6 per day, maximum 3 days. Filling and emptying of water. Light and the Local Police passes every little. The Beach at 15 meters. It only accepts card payment."
7060,1143110,1,enriquesendra,26/02/2021,"We have arrived in Boiro with the intention of parking in the service area, closed without explanation and forbidden to park in the entire municipality, without comment."
7060,1112741,5,O.cocorico,06/11/2020,"Due to the covid-19 situation, for security reasons it remains closed from 11/6/2020 until further notice"
7060,1091198,3,gelubandit1200,12/10/2020,"Due to the pandemic places are limited, but it is not well signposted. The access system opens the barrier automatically without taking into account the limited capacity, not allowing the exit after verifying that there is no place to park, having to pay to exit. The emptying zone is right in the exit lane, which hinders normal circulation. The sewage area is quite dirty. It was Saturday and music was heard from a fairly high terrace and until late. The setting and the beautiful place."
7060,1010242,4,grazziatzn,28/08/2020,"The beach is across the road, the estuary behind with a large park with games for children and an outdoor gym for adults. Squares of grass a tad on the slope. At night you can see the road and some night owl that rambles. (It was Saturday)"
7060,1008020,5,rafagm68,27/08/2020,Excellent location with the beach a few meters away and the town with services and restaurants also quite close. Easy access by reading the license plate. Recommendable.
7060,952935,3,Anloro,12/08/2020,Area with a good location. Ideal to go with children. It has a pine forest next to it with games. Beach just in front. The gray water drain zone interrupts the outlet. If someone is emptying you cannot get out. The toilet drain is on one side and the water to wash it on the other side. Only half of the places due to Covid 19. Many motorhomes without a mask.
7060,950052,4,edugu,11/08/2020,"The best of the area is undoubtedly the environment. Beach, river, park, very complete children's area. Fitness equipment. Highly recommended if you are traveling with children. The night has been very quiet, it is true that the road is next to it and I suppose that on certain days there will be more noise."
7060,927554,1,caracandao,04/08/2020,"On the side of a busy road all night. Much noise, impossible to sleep. In addition, motorhome parking is prohibited in the town and they force you to park in the area if you want to see the town. Nothing recommendable."
7060,915281,5,newdani,31/07/2020,"Loading and unloading of water. In front of the beach in the estuary, zero waves, ideal for children. max. 72 hours, controlled by barrier. Beach services very close although I don't know what time they close. Park and Swings just behind. Boiro town very close with supermarket and restaurants."
7060,892826,5,blor,23/07/2020,"Great area AC. Beach, beach bars, downtown. Maximum 72 hours."
7060,860557,5,Angoares,11/07/2020,"Beautiful town ,,, great walk on the beach and the environment where the magnificent area is located ,,, to enter the barrier opens automatically ,, then once you go to the entrance, enter your license plate on the barrier screen and you select the length of stay ,,, you put the tickets in the glove compartment and at the exit it reads the license plate and opens itself."
7060,842759,4,Terran,30/06/2020,"I confirm that it is open but with reduced places. The place is beautiful, next to the beach. It is forbidden to spend the night in the area if it is not in an authorized place. €6.70 per day, maximum 3 days."
7060,842621,5,lvilla349,30/06/2020,"It's open, they just confirmed it to me at the town hall, the price is the same, €7, only they tell me that you can stay 24 hours."
7060,810765,5,cesargasteiz,28/05/2020,Nice town and good walk next to the coast. Good poteo for the bars and very rich tapas. 5 euros per day year 2019 in August
7060,777205,4,offagain,07/02/2020,"Convenient and clean. We had a really good evening meal in the restaurant opposite. Lovely walks round the pine copse and on the beach. Nice play areas for kids and outdoor gym equipment for adults. 
When we tried to leave the barrier camera didn't recognise our number as it is a private plate but the owner of the restaurant opposite phoned someone and it was raised remotely for us."
7060,731876,5,pierre07140,27/10/2019,Air very calm easy with the map to return to step out just enter the registration number in BA you have 24 hours you can enter and go empty the black and gray waters it is to look at the ground on the plates is marked the tests and other sink and I recommend the little restaurant that is right in front very very very well
7060,715937,2,jrv2,08/10/2019,"The discharge of sewage is in a sewer in another place, if it is not known they throw it in the discharge of gray waters, very bad and dirty, it hurts that they charge."
7060,699232,3,katy47,21/09/2019,"We just wanted to go on this area srmble t he 6.07 € for 24 h, I took in French, I put a day, it was asked 18 €, I gave up, and we left by cons to the entrance there was a kid who told me that he opened the barrier without paying, there were 2 campers, maybe I was going to pay for the others ...... not very clear, too bad the place is beautiful"
7060,643542,3,dzone,19/08/2019,"It has gotten worse. A few years ago it was great, today it is complicated, uncomfortable, abandoned loading and unloading and painful black waters. Needs improvement."
7060,639552,4,aldipa,18/08/2019,"Very well located downtown, beach walk area and very well loaded park for pekes. The emptying strategically is not right. The price seems very reasonable."
7060,570276,3,gon943,23/07/2019,"Well located in grass and asphalt area near beach, commerce and walks, squares delimited with concrete cylinders. Poor design emptied and filled impeding exit to others and clarified Poti other than emptying. Lack of information in general. I am left in doubt if I go out with the vehicle to make purchases before the deadline, do I have to pay another 24 hours to enter?"
7060,546022,4,Perdi2xelmundo,09/07/2019,"Good location and good payment system. But since it is paid, they could have taken a little more care when delimiting the squares and in the location of the gray and black water drains, just at the exit. Nevertheless it is a good place to spend one or two nights. The environment, especially following the coast by bike in the east, magnificent."
7060,488603,4,Beaglecamp,20/05/2019,"Paid place, little strange barrier. You first drive through the barrier and then you pay at the pole using a touchscreen. Flat place, facilities available. Not very clean, waste everywhere while there are enough waste containers. Unfortunately."
7060,464468,4,coupleinacamper,22/04/2019,Secure place to stay €6.07 for 24hrs had a great night here. Lovely walk around with lit up areas at night.
7060,447251,3,SusoMarCas,31/03/2019,"The environment is privileged, beach, forest and lagoon. The area is mediocre. Difficult to park, maximum 7 meters. The way to pay is peculiar: the barrier opens, to enter, when you read the license plate. You park, it's not easy, and you go back to the entrance, enter the license plate and pay with a card. If you later want to extend the stay you should wait until the period ends and pay again."
7060,441867,4,KlausFoerschle,19/03/2019,A nice place. The layout is a little strange.
7060,383727,4,jnad,28/09/2018,Great place for family. We travel with our children and what a nice surprise to find so many games. Bike ride possible along the beach. A port is 5 minutes by bike so fishing opportunity. Trade and bar / restaurant not very far. Refill in water and drain water ok. There is a security barrier to the place and departure so payment in CB. Slice of 24h. 72 hours max.
7060,380693,2,bartgimp,23/09/2018,"Payment area. Bollards of cement distributed on the ground try to delimit the squares but they make the parking lot very difficult and there is danger of collision with other vehicles. Access to the water loading and unloading area is at the exit, which prevents other vehicles from leaving while it is occupied. The location is very good but the design of this parking is somewhat Machiavellian and insufficient space"
7060,354382,4,martitarm,26/08/2018,"It's very good. Playground and beach. The village is big: lidl, day, Mercadona ... and many shops. The only thing that seats only fits the motorhome, you can not be outside with awning, table ..."
7060,325168,4,jrgallego,10/08/2018,"Magnificent environment. The places are more than enough for our activity. Vials that are a bit narrow, if not parked properly or a little long motorhomes can hinder and prevent parking. Good payment management system and occupation of the area. Recommendable."
7060,316083,4,javi.astiz,05/08/2018,"The plots are sufficient, although when it is very full it is difficult to access them. Very bad signage of wc cleanliness. There is the pit at the exit of the area and the tap to clean in a pit in the garden next to the entrance. Very close to the center of town, where there is everything you need. The park next to the great area for children. On weekends there is quite a noise around."
7060,302384,2,kcgallego53,27/07/2018,Complicated to maneuver and we are tighter than the beaches of Benidorm. but as in this concello you can not even park because it is forbidden not because there is no place is the only alternative being with ac.
7060,268746,2,joseluislamas,15/06/2018,"Now with the reform, the access to the area, to the squares and to the emptying was complicated. Squares delimited by concrete cylinders that can damage the wheels. Limited to vehicles less than 7 meters and with 50% area very difficult. What a pity, could have one of the best areas of Galicia, with occupation all year round, just putting the measures of the Pontevedra would be perfect."
7060,258626,3,belkiss,24/05/2018,They did construction and now there is a camera and control. there are also fewer places. bad entry and difficult maneuver to park if there are more than half occupied seats.
7060,213638,5,Jgaracing,05/12/2017,"Area very well located and ideal to go with family !! a lot of area to play the children, emptying and filling with water !!"
7060,189810,4,centrodelsur,04/09/2017,Area next to a beautiful beach and near a cozy village Empty of grays normal but emptied of blacks and engiged of the Poti a little messy
7060,188036,5,pakorrer,31/08/2017,Fantastic area on the beachfront of the Ría de Arosa. highly recommended All services except electricity.
7060,184269,5,Adrymar,25/08/2017,"Excellent resting point. Temporarily free area to park, unload, load and overnight. On one side of the road, the parking area and on the other the spectacular beach. Children's playground with zip-line and swings for older children. Very good bicycle paths and walk along the river. At only 900 meters in the village variety of shops, food trade and restaurants."
7060,132321,2,mirabelle9,01/05/2017,Nice area on macadam or lawn. 200 m from the city.
7060,130244,5,Lara.,22/04/2017,"Ideal area to spend a few days with children, near the beach and the town. It has next to a playground and a picnic area. The town is very close to walk. Every morning the baker passes"
7060,129304,4,alacran,19/04/2017,"Very quiet, has several parks for children, passes the baker, also repsol cylinder calling the boiro dealer."

7060,90780,5,alogil,07/08/2016,"Good place to spend two or three nights, crossing the walk is the beach that has a park you can be with dogs and go down to the beach directly. Showers on the beach and wc. Some shade is missing in some areas. Pass the police to charge 3 € low temp, 6 € high temp."
7060,85908,4,brunopedre11,27/07/2016,"Very cozy and quiet, ideal for families with children. The town is very close and has good shadows, picnic and playground for children."
7060,63677,4,MarshallMack,13/02/2016,"Ok it's next to a road but not to busy at night. The beach is across from it which is great and it's a short walk into town for shops, supermarkets, restaurants ect and for 6 euros great stop, plus fresh water ect, police come round to collect the money and give you a ticket for windscreen."
7060,55963,5,Ilrez1974,25/09/2015,"Excellent, you can even settle in the pratone in front of the river"
7060,54436,4,Monrepos,10/09/2015,Very nice area. Near the beach. Near the road with passage. But near the center and the merit of existing. Drain water and filling.
7060,53365,4,Mure,01/09/2015,"Area very well located in front of a great beach and with all services (except electricity), in the morning the baker passes with bread and pastry. To put a note I will say that it is a little removed from the center of the town, but nobody is hurt by a walk by the sea."

7065,3151415,5,jero07,15/08/2023,Very good for the open air really functional possibilities of sleeping with large motorhomes thanks to the municipality
7065,3148153,5,SoleneBZH,14/08/2023,Drainage area functional and completely free!!! we didn't stay to sleep but we enjoyed sitting there while emptying and refueling.
7065,3081831,4,davidbourgeois,05/08/2023,"top you have everything to feel good, yes the road is close and yes the place is not super clean but that also makes the filth in vans and motorhomes blame themselves... personally we clean and pick up with our little gloves and garbage bags."
7065,3072076,3,deffromontfamily,03/08/2023,"Road very close, lots of room, huge parking lot, no toilet, not maintained, dirty and full of garbage and cigarette butts. At the same time it's free but in van with roof tent and children not at the top. On the other hand, there were many of us and a lot of motorhomes."

7065,2811542,4,SunSaschMini23,02/06/2023,A quiet night spent here. Large gravel parking lot relatively flat. Felt safe. About 5 more WoMos/Vans stayed here with us.
7065,2793771,3,ChristianSHA,28/05/2023,"Unfortunately had noise at night from departing local visitors. Talked loudly in front of their cars for 1 hour. Noise from the street in the morning and evening. Otherwise good place, safe feeling. Supply and disposal OK."

7065,2753388,3,SBusje,16/05/2023,"A gravel car park, nothing great but quiet at night. In the morning you can hear the thoroughfare. But it's one of the few places that takes the many campers and provides free V and E. Sad that the region is so unwelcome to us."

7116,3272891,3,jomaaut,08/09/2023,"Very well-kept campsite, large plots, on the seashore, with a beach for dogs, in September they begin to remove the awnings from the plots so you have the sun on you all day, the price of the plot includes 7kv of electricity, careful the readings are not real."
7116,3241359,4,maacska22,31/08/2023,"Stayed 3 nights from 26-Aug. The site is mega, next to the beach, with well-maintained facilities. The pitches are huge, plenty of space, and you’re allowed to choose yours, so you can find privacy. Shops very close, restaurants, bars as well (the one onsite is pretty soulless). Amazing seashores all around, but if you’re not a beach person, you better move on, as the neighborhood is pretty bleak."
7116,2826523,4,chleo,06/06/2023,very nice campsite very pleasant staff but tarpaulins are not my thing
7116,2815582,4,PaloisFB,03/06/2023,Very nice campsite with plant decoration. Large pitch with netting for shade Sanitary facilities are exemplary in design and cleanliness. Nice swimming pool. Small village with everything you need nearby and not too touristy. Beach at the end of the campsite. Small flaw: the hedges are very low. Little privacy with neighbors.
7116,2751019,4,marievague,15/05/2023,"Magnificent campsite with lots of trees and flowers. Impeccable sanitary facilities, large plot of 100m2, priced at €19 with ACSI in low season. The beach at the end of the campsite with a very pretty seafront. The only small problem, the residents' dogs barking."
7116,2736065,2,RaulSJ,09/05/2023,Regarding the characteristics of the campsite: the drainage of many of the plots and the bathrooms are somewhat old. There are only 2 Portable WCs in the entire campsite to empty the Potty.
7116,2734238,2,RaulSJ,08/05/2023,"Settlement for long-term residents and foreigners. They are not in the least interested in itinerant tourism, since they only make reservations for those who have been coming to the campsite all their lives and leave the worst pitches for the rest even if they are empty when you arrive. By worst plots I mean those that are far from the beach area and next to the main street with traffic noise. The staff is not pleasant at all, becoming arrogant, and it shows that they have plenty of money and they don't give a damn about the people who want to come for less than 1 month."
7116,2706681,5,Teilav,29/04/2023,"I am there and if time was not counted to me, I would stay there. Ok, we are aligned with the line but the pitches are wide, anti-sun shades, water and electricity at each plot, greenery everywhere and flowers, along the beach etc…. Very very good sanitary facilities. Everything, really everything is planned. A swimming pool, a grocery store and restaurants all around."
7116,2654353,4,lebronjames2306,09/04/2023,Very expensive at Easter. But overall a good place.
7116,2641810,5,BGARDES,05/04/2023,"It's big but quiet and comfortable. Very good value for money. the beach just in front is wide and clean and no problem taking the dog out, a special beach is 200m away. only small downside, we have known better maintained toilets, the cleaning is succinct and at the end of the day it is more than fair. Damage"
7116,2625619,5,Antlia,26/03/2023,"A very nice place with clean sanitary facilities. Direct access to the beach. Out of season you can also take your dog to the beach. Yes, unfortunately there are legacies from the dogs because the master or mistress does not dispose of it. Super nice employees. We were there for 4 weeks and felt very comfortable."
7116,2615791,4,MiMaDa,19/03/2023,"Very well located place near the beach. Several small restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Several destinations easily accessible. Neat place. I didn't see any dog droppings on the square. Dog shower, camper van washing area."
7116,2612082,2,babl,17/03/2023,"Space okay, plumbing could be cleaner. Unfortunately, the place is dog-infested, it feels like there are 2-3 dogs on each camper, where the rulers simply leave their legacies lying there when they feel unobserved. The smell of urine is also disgusting."
7116,2595398,4,BrigitteMorgenstern,01/03/2023,"Great place, everything clean and big enough. Wanted to swap a Spanish Cespa gas bottle but there is only Repsol. So now I have to leave the place to look for a bottle. Too bad, would have taken a Repsol."
7116,2578882,5,Michele29,15/02/2023,"clean campsite, easy to access, well flowered. Comfortable pitches in length and width. Modern and very clean toilets. rate €19 per night with Acsi. Welcome in French."
7116,2551627,4,BJB8586,14/01/2023,"There are no reservations in the classic sense, drive up and be lucky, when I came (around 3) they still had 2! free plots. Is a mega place, open-air nursing home and an incredible amount of plastic... here even the awning has an awning.... But otherwise everything clean and good location. Inexpensive, 19€ a night with ASCI incl. electricity and doggies are fair!"
7116,2550662,1,Congers354,13/01/2023,Apparently completely full or just not interested in someone wanting a 2 or 3 night stay.
7116,2537342,5,Kalbfab,01/01/2023,"The place itself deserves 5 stars. Everything available. The sanitary facilities are great. There are separate shower rooms, separated from the toilet rooms. Unspoilt showering pleasure! Wonderful location right on the sandy beach. Perfect for hiking and enjoying nature (magnificent sunsets in the sea). Unfortunately, everything that has been said about dogs and cats is true. Just too many animals! What a pity."
7116,2524781,1,LaetitiaBee,19/12/2022,"40€ per night and that seems very reasonable for some... personally I find that exaggerated!! let's go further which amounts to around 1200€ per month... at this price you might as well go to a hotel. in short, very good for Bourges the others go your way."
7116,2501529,1,sethos,20/11/2022,"Arrived here tonight and unfortunately have to say that after more than thirty years of camper holidays in Europe, I have never been received as unfriendly as here! Will leave this place as soon as possible tomorrow to never come back!!!!"
7116,2479731,3,Travelman620G,03/11/2022,"The dog campsite! A really nice place right on the beach. Clean sanitary facilities. Restaurants and a small (but very well stocked) supermarket within walking distance. However, it feels like there are more dogs than people on the square. Unfortunately, a few dog owners are of the opinion that every bench, palm tree, tree should be ""fertilized"" by the four-legged friends..."
7116,2441970,4,philthebike,13/10/2022,"clean sanitary facilities, access to the beach. nice swimming pool and small bar no other services at this season."

7116,2349146,4,gusaez,07/09/2022,"The campsite is generally good, large shaded plots, beachfront and with clean services. Number 4 ⭐️ is because they have an area enabled to wash our pets for €1. The only downside for me is that (I don't know if they want to or not) they have one or several colonies of cats that roam freely around the campsite and our dog couldn't be calm watching them go by."
7116,2285771,1,Apicazo,22/08/2022,"They make you a reservation (Cobrada) without taking into account if you take on the plot and having made a mistake, they are not responsible or take responsibility, they are capable of leaving you lying there, without explanations and without giving a solution. These details show the quality of an establishment. This one doesn't have any."
7116,2285656,4,Joern274,22/08/2022,"The campsite is clean, the toilets too, the beach too. Since dogs are allowed on this site, you should be an animal lover and have no problem with dogs barking. Otherwise it is quite noisy on the square, which is because the Spaniards are very sociable ;-) The reception was nice and uncomplicated and 40 € for 1 night are completely ok"
7116,2220894,3,park4nightDaida,12/08/2022,"Overcrowded, with many flies and close to the beach. We didn't like it very much because it was very noisy I guess because there were so many people, it had activities like in hotels (games for children, aquagym...)"
7116,2175018,4,cobovan,04/08/2022,Very family campsite. We were a family in a van. We had 2 great days. Clean sanitary.
7116,2170495,5,rubenaguer76,03/08/2022,"We discovered this campsite when we went with a caravan and we loved it, we were on the front line. Close to swimming pool baths and sea. The neighbors of the plot told us that to come there in high season you have to reserve. Now with the motorhome, we followed the advice and booked a few months in advance. The experience is still great. The plot with light shade and water. We will repeat."
7116,2074860,3,agravia,15/07/2022,"They have given me the option to choose a plot and it is quite large. The showers are new and without time limits. You can hear the sea day and night, but there are really noisy people who think this is theirs. Very friendly staff but expensive price. The pool is until 8pm. I would go back out of season because the place is nice."
7116,2048533,3,Johannesludger,08/07/2022,"Lots of shady spots, access to the beach (coarse gravel) about 400m, I found it very restless and overpriced at €38."
7116,1958998,4,ANTERO,08/06/2022,"A campsite with access to Bolnuevo beach and near Las Gredas, with shade on the plots and very quiet. It has a pool with somewhat reduced hours (11-18h)"
7116,1955266,3,Relyat,07/06/2022,"Would not visit here in summer. 
Large numbers of permanent residents who treat it as their own property. I had to get one to remove his car from my plot, he then refused to communicate. 
Large groups of family or friends, children shouting, loud music playing all day and past midnight. 
Various caravans, tents, shacks, kitchen units and appliances, flapping cloths. 
Akin to a shanty town."
7116,1949597,5,Stedaka,05/06/2022,"A very beautiful campsite, very flowery. Large pitches. Only downside for motorhomes, height limited by tarpaulins to 3m for some, 3.20m in our case .. It was right. The nearby small supermarket is very well stocked, you can find everything."
7116,1945243,1,kelianR,04/06/2022,"Camping that does not allow babies to bathe in the pool with a seat float, only with arm floats and vests. That already says a lot about the place, just a little bit of intelligence. Surreal but true. Dirty men's restrooms and baby restroom area. Correct facilities but old pool floor to change We will not return. Old campsite but correct facilities."
7116,1928119,5,joke64,29/05/2022,Large campsite with spacious pitches. Plumbing looks good and clean. The pool is open. Very nice that the campsite is located directly on the beach. in the morning you can see the municipal workers cleaning the beach! It is doable by bike to Puerto de Mazarrón. On Sundays there is also a large market with a lot of food.
7116,1917531,5,Moana41,26/05/2022,"Very nice campsite on the edge of a huge beach, and close to the village and its shops. Low price: 18 euros with ACSI, and with 7 A electricity. Spacious and sheltered pitches (see photos). One of the most beautiful campsites visited in Spain."
7116,1914719,1,RaulSJ,25/05/2022,"It is not a campsite, it is a campsite where half of the campsite is reserved all year round for the same people. Those of us who go for less than 1 month are housed next to the road or in shitty squares."
7116,1840484,4,lafalex,20/04/2022,We spent 2 nights in April at this campsite! Possibility of having pitches with a view of the sea. Peaceful and little built environment (it changes!!). Departure for beautiful hikes.
7116,1816859,5,Dargo34,12/04/2022,"very good campsite by the sea with spacious pitches, very warm welcome, ultra-clean sanitary facilities, shops nearby! for 1 month and a half in Spain and by far the best we have done! acsi card with electricity 18 euros really nothing to complain about"
7116,1799139,5,Den_Twan,28/03/2022,"Sent an email and we were welcomed. Right on the beach. Great places. Proper sanitary. Nice promenade but little enthusiasm in the area. The reception was divided, one was friendly, the other less, but correctly helped that is important. We were allowed to choose our place ourselves. Many foreigners indeed, but we also keep your economy running. Beautiful campsite, well worth a visit."
7116,1767656,5,Rodacar,27/02/2022,"Very good campsite, good welcome. There is everything you need on the large pitches. Really great and very well maintained sanitary facilities, clean. Lots of people, but very quiet. Easy access to the beach."

7116,1677631,4,Hjot,04/11/2021,"Giant camping site with 700 places, almost all of the parcels occupied, 90% overwintered on the green parcels, the rest of them wedged between the other RVs. Great, big beach, nothing for kiter surfers, if wind, then completely offshore."
7116,1647356,1,marokko,16/10/2021,"Unfortunately already unfriendly on the phone, there is a place for a week not only long-term tenants are welcome. Sorry but that's not how it should be !?"
7116,1646109,5,tondo76,15/10/2021,"Excellent, practically on the sea, swimming pool and all services. silent if full. great restaurant just outside."
7116,1632035,2,jlacacho,07/10/2021,After 20 days at the campsite: it has good facilities and the top is all the landscaping that is carefully cared for. The pitches are of good size but little privacy. On these dates you have to move and transport is a real disaster if you do not have a car. It was full of mosquitoes. And of course the vast majority of foreigners. We are honestly not satisfied
7116,1625814,5,J.G.R.,04/10/2021,"Giant camping, we went with ACSI and rate 18e 2 adults, 1/2 year old child, dog, electricity and water on the pitch. It is in good state of maintenance, flat plots. you can't ask for more."
7116,1615932,5,rorodu29,29/09/2021,"24 € 50 all inclusive with electricity car location. impeccable, large, almost luxurious sanitary facilities. Daily cleaning of the aisles 2 caveats: the size of the campsite and the number of campers., And the gravel ground. Outdoor groundsheet essential. Otherwise really on the beach. No road to cross."
7116,1591420,5,Xelina,19/09/2021,"We were great. Very spacious squares covered with raffia that provide shade, which is appreciated in the middle of August. In beachfront. I recommend it if you travel with dogs since 5 minutes away you have a great beach for dogs. Very friendly staff, correct cleaning. Maybe at some point the bathrooms are not very clean but the staff is not to blame if some users are not civic."
7116,1583940,2,RaulSJ,16/09/2021,"Pros: The campsite is quite good, excellent location on the beachfront, clean bathrooms although somewhat old, water and electricity on the pitch. Cons: No privacy. The plots do not have any delimitation, they are parking spaces. In low / medium season it is a campsite by and for foreigners. The campsite reserves the frontline pitches for you from one year to the next."
7116,1558222,4,ThierryLeneutre,08/09/2021,"Top campsite, facilities, sanitary facilities, access to the beach, all the plots have private water. I withdraw one star from the prices: 78 € for 2 nights, one person with a van! It's a shame and it's getting cold."
7116,1540213,1,Trane,02/09/2021,None too expensive and in addition we piss you off for a slightly too low mask so half turn I prefer to stay on the road do not go I advise against
7116,1512887,1,mariiacar29,25/08/2021,"Camping with many shades, very wide. The reception a little badly organized, they don't explain anything to you, they tell you which ones are free and you look for your life ... a lot of noise, shouting, music, they don't respect schedules. Is always full"
7116,1477527,5,beevann,18/08/2021,"We stayed for two nights with our two dogs, large pitches, beach at the exit of the campsite, dog beach 200m away, many bathrooms and very clean. Security working constantly, very good attention from the workers. Immense facilities, to put one but I will say that the pool was crowded but it is normal in high season. Very happy, recommended"
7116,1471956,4,BeeVan,17/08/2021,"Camping with large pitches, shade (important) and many services to enjoy (very comfortable to go with pets) It has a practically direct exit to the dog beach which is not bad. The proximity to the beach and the different services offered by the campsite make traveling by van with our pets a pleasant stop for us for a couple of days."
7116,1456254,3,Tritxe,14/08/2021,"Campsite with direct access to the beach, made of stone, 350m from the canine beach. It is big but they take care of it."
7116,1381555,1,Musojes,30/07/2021,"Too expensive, large and shady pitches, but we arrived on Thursday night and little more than they told us to look for life, the places that they told us we could occupy some were low and the motorhome did not fit, the next day when I said the one that we had stayed they told me we had to leave her in the morning, so goodbye. At the reception very unfriendly by the way."
7116,1280165,1,Montjoan,27/06/2021,"Screaming all day, also until dawn. It looks more like a settlement. It is incredible washing machines like those at home, freezer chests, sofas ... The garbage piled up Never to return, nor given"
7116,1234539,5,dinamarmelina,03/06/2021,"Super nice campsite right by the sea. We spent two nights here and were really satisfied. Not overcrowded, some parcels are still empty. Unfortunately, there is really no privacy screen to the neighbors - therefore a half star deduction. The parcels are more than big enough (there are also different sizes). Otherwise super friendly staff, also German-speaking and good service. We didn't miss anything. A spar with the most important groceries, etc. is within walking distance in less than three minutes. Indeed some with dogs, but we didn't find it annoying now. Beach is also super quiet-also not overcrowded and you have your peace. We will definitely be back."
7116,1225693,3,GabyonTour,30/05/2021,"The proximity to the beach is of course wonderful. Unfortunately, dog owners don't make it to the dog beach in the morning. There are generally too many dogs in the area. Barking late into the night. Plumbing is clean and there is a large pool. The environment is not that inviting."
7116,1211449,3,msbird,22/05/2021,"The location on the beach is great, the nearby town doesn't offer much at the moment. The plots are rather small and, as already mentioned, there is no privacy screen to the other campers. No privacy. In the pool there is no control as to whether or not there is a shower, although there is a ""supervisor"" there (on Saturdays, otherwise not)."
7116,1181297,4,DineLe,28/04/2021,"Large, well laid out place. Impresses with its location on the beach. A little too big for us, although in the off-season it is still durable from the crowd. Sanitary clean. Surprising, but there is actually no WiFi at the place, only in a corner at the bar. There is an asterisk deduction for this;)"
7116,1171727,4,TenaciousThie,10/04/2021,Basically nicely laid out and well organized location. Many winterers. Nice beach and nice sea. The space is big enough that everyone can find their place. Unfortunately no privacy screen to the neighbors and no free WiFi on the square.

Other bars and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Sanitary facilities are very good! Pitches by the sea very narrow and not to our taste. Further behind the square is empty and very quiet (in January). Estimated 50% German, many who stay over the winter but all very friendly. We'd love to come back!"

7116,1054299,4,albarnipe,17/09/2020,Ideal to spend one night. Clean and very large. In this very very quiet time. Direct access to the huge sandy beach. You can take a walk to the other side of town and it also has a pool!
7116,1028666,4,Viajerasenruta,06/09/2020,"A campsite that we have enjoyed a lot in the middle season. There were hardly any people. Prices are normal considering the magnificent views from the plots with electricity, with sea views and direct access to the beach. Good anti-covid measures, yes, the plots very close together but in size are good and in September there is tranquility. We loved it"
7116,1003769,3,ayc8081,26/08/2020,"Dog Friendly Typical beach camping Pitches are large but the ground is made of rebar and stones, a bit uncomfortable The large pitches have electricity and water and drainage connections There are few showers The pool hours are very bad, from 11 to 2 and from 5 to 8, I do not know if it is because of COVID or if it is always like this The dog beach is highly recommended"
7116,993495,1,Pakors,23/08/2020,Not recommended for the current situation. The pool overflowing with people without any measure ... and the worst thing they told us that these days it was very quiet

7116,965250,1,nanouche000,15/08/2020,All concrete ... overpriced (35 € with a small tent without electricity at 3). People are on top of each other. No nature. Positive point: large sanitary facilities and direct access to the beach. Not at all what we were looking for. To avoid.

7116,693774,4,cafanan,16/09/2019,"The park has some negative things: it is noisy, little privacy, but on the other hand has good services (including water and waste disposal on the plot itself). And then it has a magnificent location right on the beach. A wonderful sunset .... the least you can give is 4 stars."
7116,677389,5,clives56,05/09/2019,Nice place located next to the beach. The beach is very large and not crowded. Very quiet and with good facilities. The staff is very attentive and friendly. It has a supermarket inside the campsite although in the surroundings there are also other supermarkets. You have Bolnuevo and Mazarrón very close. It is a campsite to which I will return in the future.
7116,598474,3,MaPo_on_Tour,04/08/2019,"Positive: Ordinary toilets, nice little pool, right on the beach. Negative: very tight, many permanent campers until late into the night are very loud, overpriced € 36 for 1 Van 2 adults (electricity is always there) Conclusion: for one night in order."
7116,436074,1,dzenga,03/03/2019,Camping full of noise. Children call and walk around the campers. Neighbors who talk so loudly that the whole campsite should hear that a bottle of water or beer is cheaper in the Lidl than in fir. Camping itself is pico Bello. You can not say anything negative about that. But do not go there if you like peace and respect from other campers. Is a ghetto in a beautiful spot by the sea. Dogs are not allowed in resto. That is usually empty. The dogs are the most disciplined you do not hear after 1 night we left
7116,415606,3,miticoarpege,23/12/2018,Campsite like all the other campsites. In this period practically everything is occupied by northern European retirees.

7116,412824,1,carina123,08/12/2018,Worse is not possible - there you can stay in Berlin Mitte! Closer - this place! And overpriced without end! Never again - one night is enough! No Wi-Fi also! Adios Amigo!

The tap is not threaded, something they should change."

But some heartless people had emptied the sewage into the drain of the fountain because they must not have found the trapdoor of the black drain ... I hope. It would be good if the indications put them at least in English so that the foreigners could understand it, although the graphs spoke for themselves. For these things we sometimes pay righteous for sinners."

7118,3109612,4,Mr.Estevez,09/08/2023,Parking in a polygon without services and very close to the train station. There are caravans without owners parked but in general there is no sense of danger at any time.

But the party starts at 10pm and continues till 3am! The place itself is not charming, very industrial except for the view on the river. But as all campings are full in high season the options are limited along this part of the coast."

But we felt safe and it was quiet at night. Where else should you stand is difficult here on the coast. And space is close to the place. Make sure to take a walk to the flysch rocks. It's worth it!"

7147,9236,2,mick38,28/08/2013,"Not much to do here, but it helps if you come from Figueres and you do not want to get lost in Roses. The bell tower rings all night. The stadium car park is with trees, otherwise the cemetery further away."
7158,3258324,5,Michval2009,04/09/2023,"A great discovery, we were looking to drain the water and refill, and came across this place right next to the Albufeira football field. the price of 6 euros to just do the emptying is the same as to spend the night there with water, electricity, wifi, hot shower and location large enough for our 8m the person at the reception speaks French very well. Go for it !!!"

7158,3208172,4,ilnomechevolevononeralibero,23/08/2023,"Campsite for campers very large. Large pitches and all perfect services. Paid showers and toilets but they are spotless and the refreshing showers after days spent in the van are worth the euro spent. Unfriendly reception by the staff, but it must have been a coincidence. I recommend always checking if they have availability on their site. The cliff beach within walking distance is gorgeous."
7158,3194962,5,roallatour,21/08/2023,"Sunny area, but with all the services and CS, during our stay, there were renovation works on the bathrooms, but still usable. The lady at the reception was very kind and helpful. €6 per day all inclusive. City center and beach easily reachable by taxi at a good price. Shopping center nearby. Better with an electric bicycle."
7158,3169853,4,edensopha,17/08/2023,"Too bad that this area is full because very popular with holidaymakers. Despite everything, we were able to spend a night in the parking lot while benefiting from the services, showers, toilets and water replenishment."

However, we arrived at 7 in the afternoon and there was no one at the reception, we parked and at 12:30 p.m. we were thrown out in a bad way by supposedly the owner arguing that the entrance was until 4:00 p.m., that it was full and that we were not a motorhome ( we are camper van)."

7158,3024727,4,gafiloupio,26/07/2023,Great area despite the lack of shade but the wind is near and so it's fine. Future area which will be at the top with sanitary facilities being renovated a little far from the center and the beaches but that makes it calm and pleasant even
7158,3015455,5,AbelR.,24/07/2023,"€6 per night Ac 2 people 1 girl with electricity. shower services, sink, dishwasher according to its price without great luxuries but correct. Laundry service.

7158,3014418,3,carlaleone05,24/07/2023,"Sanitary facilities almost non-existent but for the price (6€ for 2 + van), we can't really complain. They are currently under construction. Otherwise it is more than enough for one night, you will be quite close to the center"
7158,3013480,3,Serbumm,24/07/2023,"We put 3 stars because it is fine and you have access to showers, WC and emptying and filling service. We called a few times and there was no time to locate anyone to ask about available slots. As a payment area it is fine, it is economical. But it is with reforms. Shared bathrooms. 20 minutes from the center."
7158,3008661,2,ibonrossi,23/07/2023,"The only thing that stands out is the shower and bathrooms. I put a 2 because after 4:00 p.m. there is no option to enter (even if you call 5 times). Also because it is very crowded and there is little turnover. Lots of people are sitting there. We went and saw only 3 ""free"" plots with chairs or tents in which you couldn't park either. I recommend looking elsewhere."
7158,2993885,5,MAXPD,20/07/2023,Very good!!! Very comfortable and with showers and bathrooms… you can unload the chemical toilet and load clean water! Convenient in the center with Huber at the price of €3.50
7158,2981752,5,koalaiadan,18/07/2023,"Very good value for money (€6 with electricity included and free showers and toilets, it's very, very good). You have to pay attention because there is a row of plots with a smaller size, the others have a perfect size. During our instance they were expanding facilities (more showers and bathrooms). Recommended place to spend a few days in Albufeira and visit that city."
7158,2967955,5,AlmuBorja,15/07/2023,"Very good place, very friendly at reception. We arrived and they weren't there, but you can come in and pay the next day. Bathrooms, showers and sink under construction. In fact water cut off when we left but understandable. To the center it is a 15-20 min walk downhill, the bus can be taken next to the area for €1.90. A taxi costs €5 more or less. €6 per day with electricity and water changes included."
7158,2966008,2,myfriendstan1,15/07/2023,"Good location, good value just a bit of a grim outlook. Quite a few permanents on site but functional for an overnight and a short walk into town/escalators."

Many sedentary, some very rude parked on the opposite side of the reception (at 4 am on Friday they started screaming drunk and it seems not the first time). Better to park away from them. Good location for visiting the center, even by bus."

We actually paid for a hot shower and used the laundry room in the campsite and filled up water for €3 each… so €6 total which was great. If you don’t need electric then I’d say stay out front…. Also a must is to visit albufeira riding center and go for a horse ride… incredible ."
7158,2598819,4,AnkeRolf,05/03/2023,"The place is getting old. Everything you need on the go is there. Friendly staff. clean, small showers. The individual places are large enough, but all very close together, so that you have no privacy. Some like it that way, we don't. The number 10 bus takes you to the old town. It was ok for one night."

7158,2448353,4,Raffilka,17/10/2022,"For the price (9€) a great place to explore Albufeira. About 20 minutes walk to the beach, Aldi and Lidl 10 minutes walk. Showers and toilets aren't the prettiest, but serve the purpose. Electricity at no extra charge. No trees to provide shade. Reception is only open in certain time windows. We can recommend the pitch!"

7158,2430139,4,amantares,08/10/2022,"Perfect place, I don't give it five stars because it advertises Wifi and it doesn't have it, also in October they raise it to €9, that is, a 50% increase in winter"
7158,2429840,4,p46ait,07/10/2022,Very good area. Quality price is fine. It lacks a bit of shade but otherwise fine. Bathrooms a bit old but clean.
7158,2427206,4,sprinter216,06/10/2022,"The location is great, it would be 5 stars if it had some shade but you can't have everything. Friendly, uncomplicated check-in. From October 9 € including service, the price is ok. It is the PP at the stadium."

7158,2409889,5,AnnieEmme,28/09/2022,"Stupendous! For the modest sum of € 6 per night, water and services included, one of the best parking areas ever visited. Each additional person 3 €. Unlimited hot water, separate male / female showers and toilets. Rubbish with separate collection within the area and laundry. Spacious pitches and top location. At 100m from the bus terminal, on foot in 15 minutes you are in the center. Super recommended!"
7158,2398026,5,caocaoye,23/09/2022,"We arrived in the evening, pushed the barrier aside and chose a place. Quiet place with showers, toilet and service facilities. Was a bit difficult to pay, you have to adjust the working hours. The staff was very friendly, we were there from about 8 p.m. to 7 p.m. the following day and only paid for one night, but check out would normally be in the morning."
7158,2395304,4,Opeixe,22/09/2022,"Super recommended. €6/night. We spent two very quiet nights, without noise or any kind of disturbance. It has capacity for 100 seats. Large pitches, friendly reception staff. It would improve the cleanliness of the bathrooms, but if you can do without using them, that's fine."

7158,2386933,4,Marcodu64,19/09/2022,6 € Frankly it's top. Everything is included and everything works. The welcome is very nice. The beach 10 minutes away ... adding 15 minutes is good. Albufeira is really dynamic. You can go from the noise and the atmosphere to the calm in a small cove just 3 km away. The nights are very calm on the site. Very very good address.

7158,2368391,4,j0nTxu,13/09/2022,"€6 for two people with electricity and all services for free, except the washing machine. The downsides, you leave the van full of white dust and the first day we were there, the showers were fine, but the second day there was no hot water (there was construction going on outside and that might be why)."
7158,2356178,3,pelolo,09/09/2022,"It is a very cheap area €6 a night with electricity, the showers have hot water and I did not feel that way, the toilets were very poorly maintained and the sinks only worked one A lot of white powder the whole car For one night it can be worth"
7158,2341521,4,jalomur,05/09/2022,"Very good place except for those of us who go by camper instead of a caravan because we have no shade, and it is nothing more than an old soccer field converted into parking lots. But very large squares, and showers with a good flow of hot water. There was no paper in the bathrooms. But for 6e little more you can ask"
7158,2332340,3,DoerteSundermeyer,02/09/2022,Price with 6 € super toilet and shower with once much too little for the number of mobile homes!

7158,2286734,1,mcardoso8,22/08/2022,"After spending more than an hour walking around Albufeira, there is not a single place. This site that promises to have a hole, was complete having to leave the AC outside the premises with the danger of being robbed or breaking your vehicle."
7158,2275065,5,patalain83110,20/08/2022,"Very well. Clean showers and toilets. Very welcoming. By bike, very easy to get around. We will go back there."
7158,2267721,4,soysergio1,19/08/2022,"100% recommended, good price €7 per night with flat and well-defined pitches. The sinks and showers are a bit old but the water comes out fine. It is next to the bus station and it is ideal to take the bus to return from the beach or the town as there is a steep climb."
7158,2264880,3,McDreamy2022,19/08/2022,"Looks actually good enough for parking, more then power or water you don’t need with CV. But, it was full. No one at reception, no person to be found to ask around. We had to camp at the parking of the camping, felt a bit unsafe not sure if legal.. but there were 12 other campervans here as well. Seems not easy to find a spot in Albufeira with a camper!"
7158,2255180,4,padalu69,17/08/2022,"All right. Light, water and drainage. It is what we need in a motorhome area. It would be better if it had more shadows. Friendly and helpful staff."
7158,2253430,5,SMlove,17/08/2022,"We spent 2 nights on site. In a motorhome, it's easier. Large bustling town and beach 15 mins. The services at the top. Shower, WC, laundry and enough to fill up with water and drain. Only downside women's sanitary often filled, too small."
7158,2243969,4,SoniaJaviyZazu,15/08/2022,"it is a very cheap area and it has all the services, I am not giving it 5 stars because in August it is very crowded with people, it almost looks like a campsite, and it is difficult very difficult to find a place!"

7158,2152648,3,Josephinemarteens,31/07/2022,"Always very welcoming by the staff who have changed. Close to shops and the mercado, a kind of large market open every day. No shade and stuffy with the hot weather in Portugal. Always clean toilets, and well maintained by the staff, but everything is deteriorating quickly, urinal broken, one toilet out of order, door locks no longer hold. Toilet drain cover half broken, no more water or maintenance of the plantations dying little by little, the concrete collapsing to the drying racks, half the dogs not kept on a leash, coming their droppings do your RV, where people do the take dogs to relieve themselves in the park towards the bowling alley.. the campers have found the stones that served as a step to the drying racks, showers now mixed, no more night surveillance, campers arrive late, empty, fill the water, use the electricity and leave very early in the morning for free to wake you up with the motorbike ... we feel a definite deterioration of what made the charm of this really cheap park. Too bad, Dutch friends like us told me he wouldn't come back there again.."

7158,2132935,5,thometlaeti,27/07/2022,Top location close to the city center. 5' by bike. The pitches are large. The price is ridiculous because electricity showers and toilets included. The managers are very friendly. I recommend without problem.

7158,2041682,5,CynASM,05/07/2022,Phenomenal. We only went to use their emptying and filling services (€6) but for a little more you can spend the night. They treated us wonderfully and the atmosphere that was observed was very good. We recommend it without a doubt
7158,2015917,5,MartaJaner,27/06/2022,"We arrived late at night to find the owners arriving! We were very lucky! The place is spacious, clean and safe. With all the services mentioned above. The marriage that runs it, very friendly and helpful."

There is only 1 bathroom for 100 seats and all very old and dirty. We spent 1 night and left. I do not recommend"

7158,1901777,1,marycath,20/05/2022,"The showers are outdated, and atrocious. Privacy is maintained simply by a shower curtain, old, dirty and doesn't even cover the entire shower! there is no guard between 6 p.m. and 9 a.m., so it is impossible to enter and leave between these hours. Entrance to the parking lot difficult to find, is located at the bottom of another parking lot.... we only recommend it as a last resort."
7158,1892153,5,patoumichel,15/05/2022,we stayed there for 6 days. We were fine. Recommended for visiting Albufeira. We went to visit faro by bus which is at the exit of the campsite. The bus station is across the road.

 we thought was great."

Location is near shops and about 20-25mins walk to Old Town or The Strip.

We stayed for 2 nights and the WiFi only worked for the first afternoon, and it's annoying that the price was higher in Jan but about the same as some other sites.
1 female toilet and 2 showers - dated but clean. Take your own loo roll!"

For € 6 you have an overnight, water change, electricity, Wi-Fi and access to bathrooms and showers (they need a reform but for this price you cannot demand more). Fully recommended if you pass through Albufeira."

It is 20 minutes walk from the historic center. Restrooms not as clean as they should be, but also not to throw your hands on your head."
7158,1378719,4,raulsinho,29/07/2021,Excellent quality / price ratio. For only € 6 loading and unloading of water current 220v. Without shadow. The bathrooms are poorly designed for the amount of people that could have housed. Only two toilet bowls and two sinks. When we were there (end of July) there were plenty of pitches and few people. Apparently it is managed by a local sports entity (soccer?).

The service area is practical. € 6 for an all-inclusive night, so it remains a very good compromise for this coast.

Restroom doors don’t close, the entire floor is wet, no toilet paper.
The shower size is good but as everything is wet (even the chair which is likely meant for putting down your clothes) and there are no hangers, you can’t keep your clothes anywhere dry while taking a shower. 
It seems like most of the people are living there full time."

No shade, maybe.  when it comes to cleanliness, once or twice a week, there is a person who cleans all the shower buildings, men's and women's toilets, the laundry room, and all this with a jet of water and disinfectant.  In addition, the same goes for the bins, emptied regularly, and cleaned with a water jet every week.  At most, the Parque da Palmeira should invest in one of the taps for the men's showers, which sometimes leaks.  Really some reviews are untrue."

7158,750748,2,Josephinemarteens,07/12/2019,"As the previous comment, have felt that there is a kind of mafia of a few Swedes, not all, who make their small traffic to put chairs or stone studs, as soon as a place is free, and call of  other Swedish to come quickly and settle.  And pass quietly in front of others waiting for their places outside.  these Swedes are like on conquered ground.  the anger starts to rise in other motorhomes, including French, but also English, Spanish or even Portuguese, who see what these people do, who have no respect for this host country, and not for others people.  ."

Good some investment in toilets and showers would be welcome. There is sanitary and shower always well maintained and electricity, drain terminal for water and cassettes. But otherwise, this park is nice to spend a few months for Christmas, because really near the city center, shops, Portuguese administrations, and beaches. Except in winter of course. A lot of entertainment at night in the city, and super nice to have a drink on the big square in the sun, that's what is good in Portugal."

7158,366421,5,WorkingNomad.com,06/09/2018,What a totally awesome and legit place. The owner was friendly and services were great. Nice mix of campers and motorhomes. The town itself has no redeeming features for anyone with a sense of class. Yes that's probably why I ended up there but my stay was short. You cannot fault this camper park and Lidl and Aldi are less than 10 mins walk for those who are not too lazy (sadly many are) to walk.

7278,789977,3,christianfelix,02/03/2020,"Water fountain, calm, the beach 100 meters round from the cool police"
7278,787979,4,hoby,28/02/2020,It is true there is nobody. yet well lit water
7278,748521,3,alemantrad,30/11/2019,Strange but there is no one. There were always many acs at this time. Could it be that the police kick us out? Anyway I see no signs of prohibition
7278,437056,1,f.r.e.d,06/03/2019,"The police took pictures of our motorhomes, I think they will send us fines."
7278,424314,3,dopeycoupe,24/01/2019,"Good parking spot for approx 10 vans, water in park opposite turned on Jan 2019, also large font in square. Have not seen and public WC. Walks along beach and river through orange groves. Small supermarket and a couple of bar/restaurants open."
7278,95728,1,willys,16/08/2016,"I just passed and they cut the water of the fountain, a pity"
7278,89726,5,willys,05/08/2016,Calm quiet corner the fountain always there. I filled up with a 10-liter nanny. The police turn and say nothing.
7278,65427,3,paellero69,14/03/2016,Very good but no solidarity
7278,42038,2,flaval,14/07/2015,"No shower, no toilet, a water fountain, no filling possible. the police secure the premises, friendly trade nearby but at tourist prices ... beautiful beach. There is perhaps better place on Gandia to discover."
7278,36373,3,seb65,13/05/2015,"Impeccable with children's play area and deserted town on May 13, 2015, 150 m from the beach"

7303,3274569,4,LuisLudovico,08/09/2023,"Excellent location for a visit to the historic area of Zafra (a pleasant surprise for me). Despite ASA being in an area with a lot of traffic, the night was very calm. Supermarket across the street."
7303,3260133,3,Oneka,05/09/2023,"neither fu nor fa, the area is just fine, about 10 spaces for ac, inclined. right next to the road where cars are passing all day long. If you wake up to the sound of a fly flying, this is not your place. I can't comment on the services because I'm not going to use them. Yes, the lid of the black ones, they might even be bothered by putting a little string to open it."
7303,3226969,3,lumbertito,27/08/2023,"The parking lot has all the services and is well located to visit the city, however, we could hardly sleep since it is very close to a disco or party place, and all the young people who come from there pass through the parking lot and are very disrespectful. (The day we stayed was Saturday, maybe not during the week)."
7303,3188319,5,CRISYVIC,20/08/2023,"Very large area with good services. Large municipal swimming pool for the summer, within walking distance. A good option to stop in the middle of the silver route."
7303,3187128,2,oceeme,20/08/2023,"10 designated spaces in full sun, so it is normal to occupy the ones in front, under the trees. The sewage chest is poorly designed and it is difficult to empty without splashing what accumulates there. The taps are not identified as WC and drinking."
7303,3179969,5,mercedessantos,19/08/2023,We stopped here to clean the water and cassettes. All excellent.

7303,2796947,5,ducrem,29/05/2023,It is perfectly located to get to know the city center and enjoy the gastronomy. quiet and nice place
7303,2764514,4,leonangela,19/05/2023,The square is very close to the lovely old town you just have to go a little further in! Great places to eat at the Plaza Grande. You can bear that the parking space is a bit sloping and noisy. Thanks to the city for free service
7303,2755930,2,Barcobird,17/05/2023,"Situated on a car park in between two busy roads so quite noisy. Difficult to find a place without using blocks. It’s ok for servicing and spending a night if you have to, otherwise move on. Walked into town which historically is not really worth the visit but has bars and restaurants as you would expect. Although not the best it’s still appreciated the town has supplied the service."
7303,2693414,3,Philip02,24/04/2023,Quite noisy from passing traffic. However free and able to empty and fill.
7303,2671681,4,JIvan77,15/04/2023,"The squares are large, although they are uneven. It has to empty and fill. It is easy to find and is only 10 minutes from the center of Zafra. We spent the night and slept well."
7303,2653963,1,evamrg45,09/04/2023,"More than an area, it is a parking lot. Next to a main avenue with a lot of traffic. It's stressful because of the noise. It's not good for sleeping. Central."

7303,2630175,4,Yaez,30/03/2023,"Zafra is worth it, the area is comfortable, it's a pity that the squares are not well delimited, for the rest, the area is great and the town is very pretty!"
7303,2629155,2,Beasty442,29/03/2023,"We only parked here to use the local laundry. Slopping parking and lots of litter. Very noisy with passing traffic and beeps of the pedestrian crossing. Toilets were not in a clean condition. We overnighted in the parking area near the Mercadona, turns out the walk into town is shorter than from there."
7303,2616878,1,dragonqueen,20/03/2023,"Noisy, very dirty, all places at an angle, not inviting even if you really have no claims, we drove on"
7303,2555518,3,maridaporto,19/01/2023,"Close to busy roads during the day and partially at night. Near the center going on foot (10 minutes). Ok the services. Small stalls, but there is still room to stop."
7303,2551020,1,fan4womo,13/01/2023,"Apart from the fact that everything was full, only smaller mobile homes fit in the front, because otherwise they would get in the way. In between, there are also cars. The square is sloping everywhere and gives the impression of a siding. Big shards of glass in a corner and loud screaming from at least 5 people at the same time in the toilet house on the square. When it's cold, homeless people sleep there."
7303,2549599,2,bkb,12/01/2023,"Sloping parking along a very busy street. Water and drains. Trash cans. Bathroom. From 5 a.m., resumption of noisy traffic. Close to the old center."
7303,2525604,1,Fer-Lau,21/12/2022,"Lots of noise day and night, impossible to sleep; It is located between two busy avenues. I don't know if I'll be able to visit Zafra in a single day but I won't spend another night in this car park because it really isn't an area."

7303,2515639,5,vbaen,07/12/2022,"We only stopped to visit Zafra. Very good location, 5 minutes walk from the tourist center. There was more AC, it seems safe. Nearby there are supermarkets, gasoline and cafeteria. Good option to visit the city."

7303,2510807,1,merlinamoreno,02/12/2022,"They call it a motorhome area for wearing the medal, but it is a parking lot with very few ""reserved"" spaces for motorhomes. It is also impossible to sleep with the noise of the avenue."
7303,2506692,3,rasl2000,27/11/2022,"We only parked to visit Zafra, access is easy as it is located next to the road and the town center is down an avenue. It is very nice to meet. The site seemed strange to me for an area, really."
7303,2494458,5,tesivan,13/11/2022,"Area for AC and large vans with good access from the road. We spent the night there comfortably and without noise. There has been no night watch, but the area is quiet and safe. 5 minutes of the center. We will be back."
7303,2490968,2,JuanFerPi,11/11/2022,"Asphalt ac area, very steep, next to a main road (a lot of constant noise), with hardly any shade. In other words, the opposite of a good motorhome area."

7303,2473204,4,leoquesada,31/10/2022,"Good area for motorhomes, delimited by a fence, water service, a sense of security, well located for visiting the old town with a Día supermarket opposite and somewhat noisy due to the passage of the road. With a few good plugs at night the small problem is solved. Perfect as a headquarters to visit the south of the province of Badajoz."
7303,2466137,2,amantares,28/10/2022,"Thanks to Zafra for this area, but it is very poorly designed because the places are too short for an AC and the noise at night is too much due to traffic"

7303,2442503,3,tyrion,14/10/2022,"For parking it's fine, for staying overnight, for those who are bothered by the sound of traffic maybe not so much. Of course, the toilets are dirty and full of garbage. If the ajt puts this service there it should be kept in good condition and not so disgusting"
7303,2440393,2,elsincroman,13/10/2022,"Very noisy. it is on the verge of a lack of important traffic and it is difficult to rest. Otherwise well. there are basic toilets, but they lack maintenance."
7303,2412369,3,marsuma7,29/09/2022,"Good parking area close to the center. For the night it is noisy and some squares, around the pavilion, are tilted sideways. Thanks to the municipality for keeping us in mind."
7303,2408441,4,Treeza,28/09/2022,"Good place to park, plenty of room, nice town a short walk away with a Turismo - make sure you find the old quarter behind the parador. BUT the parking is shut for the Feria at the end of September for a few days so do check before you arrive that it’s not on. A bit of traffic noise but not too awful."

7303,2131302,3,ebarru,27/07/2022,uneven place with little shade. For the summer close the pool. The historic center is also close. right place to make a stop.

7303,1733617,4,mchicoc,14/01/2022,"SUMMARY: Thank you for these facilities, quiet night and all the services. Ideal for visiting the area. DETAIL: The door is broken and that is why no one closes it. I don't really see a problem with it either. The black cover, since in many areas it is a chest, I don't see a problem with it either. Noise? Being on the street near a road, gentlemen, remember that you sleep 4 fingers from the street... and the inclination... I don't see it as making the glasses fall..."
7303,1728497,4,correcaminos99,07/01/2022,"Somewhat inclined, asphalted and close to the center. We were a few ACs."

7303,1705070,3,cienalpi,07/12/2021,Centric area without casting of quarter notes. The squares a little inclined. Everything you need is close at hand. Too noisy since it is located in one of the main roundabouts of the town artery. Anyway the town and its restaurants are worth it.
7303,1688597,5,perichs,14/11/2021,"Thanks to the Zafra town hall for making an area where you can park and spend the night. It is in a central location and very close to the tourist office, who were all very kind with the explanations. To put a but, it is next to the main road and it is very noisy, it is not very advisable if you want to rest"
7303,1688314,3,volvoreta,14/11/2021,"Very central, to visit great Zafra, and changes, but very noisy to sleep, two roads with a lot of traffic and some clumsy past of turns at the wee hours of the morning shouting. Thanks to the City Council for taking us into account."
7303,1687894,5,Leikamus,13/11/2021,"First of all...to all the bad reviews... Its for free!! What can you expect??
We liked it a lot!! ample space, trees, birds, a nice clean parking lot, water, wasted disposal (gray & black) and a big bin.
Supermarket 100m away, a short walk from the town centre.
You can hear the traffic but come on its in the city, we weren't bothered.
Thanks to the townhalls for providing a place like this."

7303,1354787,4,mjcuenca,23/07/2021,"Near the center, it has generous parking spaces. It has toilets and gray drainage as well as a load of water. Across from a pretty good supermarket. The cons: lack of shade in summer, and it has no black cast."
7303,1331983,4,Esmar,17/07/2021,"It is a very safe place (we left the keys in the outside and they were still there in the morning). He also has the police on his side. The toilets are closed, and that's why I give it a 4. Ideal for visiting the city of Zafra, which is very beautiful."
7303,1301198,4,Miranda05,06/07/2021,"Not a bad a spot to park to see the town, possibly even stay for the night, although there is a busy road right next to the area. Town centre is only about 10min walk away. Most spots seem to have a bit of an inclination one way or the other but nothing too big. It's free and available!"
7303,1281728,3,ECM,27/06/2021,"I dare not say that the area is bad but it does look a bit neglected and in fact there were three caravans that seemed to be there permanently. It has not given us a good impression, we have gone to sleep elsewhere."
7303,1277681,4,hansd72,26/06/2021,"Next to the police, wide access without entering the town, it is next to the road there can be noise. next to the area there are restaurants and a rich bar for breakfast. Across the road there is an Aldi, add a plus. this area, with plenty of parking space. The star that I remove is because of the noise there was by a small group of people talking, I suppose because it was Friday"
7303,1265247,5,ISIDRIKI,19/06/2021,"Good place to visit Zafra, we stayed one night, a walk to the Plaza, we slept quietly and without noise, free emptying and filling area, the toilets were closed and it is a little inclined, but being a large enclosure you have fairly flat squares .

Everything is clean and the containers are close"

7303,1129199,1,Casiaris,08/01/2021,"Just out of urgent need for my taste. Nothing about bathrooms, it's totally unhealthy. Clean water can be emptied and refilled. Quite a lot of car traffic.

7356,3049628,4,albav,31/07/2023,"Very nice and with a pool, playground, etc. The only drawbacks are: it doesn't have a WC, only showers, and it gets very crowded, so it's advisable to go in the morning."
7356,3047808,5,CarinaPinho,30/07/2023,"very nice place, super clean has showers but no bathroom. It has a sink and has a wonderful swimming pool. It has a games room for both the youngest and adults with 2 televisions. the staff is all super friendly"

Magnificent beaches, pretty little towns with shops and restaurants. We will definitely be back! In addition this place is really located in one of the most beautiful places in the Algarve."
7356,2984985,1,Evagd22,18/07/2023,"Bad reception. The man at the reception directly ""invited"" us to leave. He offered us a site with no electricity and while we were discussing it he was already offering it to someone over the phone (without mentioning any electricity). I do not recommend it."
7356,2982494,1,kirrorro,18/07/2023,"I came back this year and I am very disappointed. A relative came to bring me from Spain my children, two minors, that we already warned those responsible on the day of our arrival. Well, they wanted to charge him if he entered the area to drop off the children. You have to be petty and mean. It's not the money, it's the ways. Of course we checked out the next day and will never return."
7356,2973649,5,PratReef,16/07/2023,"A great area, 100% recommended. The staff is very attentive and everything is very clean. The luxury pool."

7356,2955973,1,marga12,12/07/2023,"Correct area for the services it details and friendly treatment with adults. Brusque treatment with children and unkind to them, even chased and watched in case they did something they didn't like. so it's not a family site, adults only better. We won't be back!"

Only service is possible for 4 euros. Available: washing machine, dryer, shower for 1 €/ 5 minutes, dog shower, heated pool, lounge area with billiards, darts and more, mega!! Aldi right around the corner. we love the place, friendly owner and colleagues :)"
7356,2562875,2,Himalaya13,28/01/2023,"On arrival the girl was very welcoming. Unfortunately, the next morning it turned out that the man is her opposite who clearly does not receive even quiet children on the spot. It feels like you are being watched all day long. Definitely not worth repeating."
7356,2553450,3,MarkJager,16/01/2023,"Unfortunately full at 2 p.m. and you can't make a reservation or call, so we drove for nothing."

7356,2523946,5,Fischkoepp,18/12/2022,"Very nice place with friendly, helpful staff. The special feature is the small heated pool with 28°."
7356,2520962,5,B.Niebroek,13/12/2022,"top motorhome, is often and quickly full. There are a few spare places without electricity, as soon as someone leaves, you can move to a place with electricity. There is a living room with games, pool table, TV and charging points for mobile phones, etc. A heated swimming pool, free cold shower, hot shower 1 euro. There is no toilet. The cp is already nicely decorated for Christmas. Aldi is within walking distance."
7356,2516266,5,dume30,08/12/2022,"Considering the price of the plot (12th with elec.) the proposed infrastructure, the proximity of shops, the setting, the surroundings and the friendliness of the staff, that puts it on the podium!"
7356,2513533,2,LukeDani21,05/12/2022,"Beautiful campsite, but if you are short-term you will be referred to a side street of the campsite. Gate closes behind you. Then if you want to get out there is no one to help. Just walking along is too much effort. No toilets available. Refilling water costs 4 euros. When my girlfriend wanted to blow-dry her hair, this was not allowed. That would cost too much power. Not a nice experience"
7356,2507986,5,GerdaPfaff,28/11/2022,Family-run campsite. Not only the operators but also most of the guests are super friendly. You get the feeling of belonging to a big family. The place is very well maintained and everything you need is there. Shops and restaurants can all be found in the immediate vicinity. We'd love to come back.
7356,2499761,5,Bozogozo,19/11/2022,"Clean and well managed site with all the facilities, plus heated swimming pool, games room. There are no toilets on site so only for campers with their own toilet. Friendly staff and good location, would recommend."
7356,2499476,5,MCK85,18/11/2022,"Human-sized area, €12 electricity included. Very well maintained and tastefully landscaped. The welcome is most pleasant with Yann, always ready to help you, all in a good mood and this by practicing several languages. Beach at 1.5km, Aldi supermarket at 500m, and many other shops."
7356,2490761,1,ipetrus,11/11/2022,"hello police, 4€ to fill with water but you can't use the sanitary facilities or the washing machines. Always someone watching you and making you feel uncomfortable. I do not recommend unhealthy!"
7356,2490679,1,Happyhealthy8,11/11/2022,Terrible spot! People are watching you checking everything! Nonsense ! No toilets ! 4euros to fill not even allowed to use theirs sinks A JOKE!

Many regular guests and winter visitors, everyone extremely friendly, including the manager. Super clean, really warm pool. Only downside no toilet, beautiful quiet beach close by. Aldi around the corner and excellent restaurant around the corner. Ended up staying 5 nights."

Swimming pool with hot water, supermarket at 800m and beach at 1km ( /_ ).Price 10(without electricity)12 (with electricity)=all year.I highly recommend a stay"
7356,2413980,5,vaziuojam,30/09/2022,"A medium sized motorhome campsite, clean, well maintained. The pitches are decently sized, fairly level, have electricity, water available on the pitch. 1 service area, no common WC. Quite close to a small town with shops, several restaurants. Not a bad thing, but something that we thought of - this place is extra calm, mainly seniors who spend their days reading and evenings watching tv, so we felt a bit watched and guilty when chatting with our friends outside. I think it would be a better choice for couples/solo travelers looking for piece and quiet rather than groups of friends or families."
7356,2359584,5,carolecaro89,10/09/2022,Very clean and top-notch motorhome area Yann is really great. Trade nearby beach 15 minutes walk I really recommend this area
7356,2346644,4,adventurero,06/09/2022,"Spectacular site. Very careful, clean and tidy. Reasonable price for very good facilities. I do not give it 5 stars because it does not have services, only showers. The beach is a 15-20 minute walk away. Highly recommended."
7356,2335741,2,Burgaillo,03/09/2022,"If it weren't for the hours it has, I would give it more stars but even at half throttle, they force you to leave at 11:00 and I didn't like that detail, but they are their rules :-( They put us on the plot with no option light, pay what you pay hot showers are paid Very quiet at night, yes."
7356,2330140,5,parknight1731,01/09/2022,"This area is perfect. The welcome by Yann is very warm. The whole space is well maintained, everything is impeccably clean. There is a swimming pool, pétanque court, rest room with TV and games, wifi. Near beach and shops. Very quiet night."
7356,2290148,4,SimonBerlin,23/08/2022,Well frequented pitch. 4 adults 16 EUR per night. Pool is great. The way to the sea is quite a walk. You have to use your own toilet.
7356,2148698,4,nicos49,31/07/2022,"very friendly and well-maintained campsite atmosphere, magnificent swimming pool. but a little too calm and strict for our taste. it lacks a bit of atmosphere in the evening for holidays."
7356,2145563,4,THX113851,30/07/2022,Everything is niquel indeed but for the water and the emptying it is 4€ and not 1€.
7356,2131322,4,machaka,27/07/2022,"Everything very clean, very arranged and with the plus of the pool. As a negative note that in the year 2022 you cannot pay by credit card"
7356,2131009,5,Campwolf50,27/07/2022,Very nice employees only removed gray and toilet water for 4 € everything was super top top
7356,2112250,2,kikarola,23/07/2022,"It's not the first time we've seen this park, but this time it was disappointing as they lowered the amperage to 4 amps, which is not enough for a good stay. You have to pay for hot water showers, there are no bathrooms. There are no shades and not being possible to turn on air conditioning is unbearable on very hot days. It's a shame because the park had everything to be the best park in the Algarve."
7356,2107655,5,bawzon,22/07/2022,"Very nice and clean site. Nice swimming pool and common area with tv, pool table and all sorts of board games. Privacy in the showers might be an issue for some."

7356,2016867,4,cucoisra,27/06/2022,"All very well. Price 4 people without electricity €16. Keep in mind that if you leave this area after 11:00 in the morning, you will be charged another day, no matter what time you arrived. This aspect was not explained to us in this way. Be careful with that, they charged us €32 from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. (24h). So we stayed that night until 11:00 in the morning."

Unfortunately there is no toilet. With this it would be one of the best campsites in Portugal in my opinion. But all in all, more than great for a night or two."
7356,1934548,5,gestionarce,31/05/2022,"It's called Park de Gale, fantastic place by bike many nice beaches less than 3 kms, super next door, perfect just use AC bathroom. I will come back for sure"

Livingroom with WIFI. A lot of people stay for a long time. Every one is very nice. Shower for the dogs is nice. Pastelaria Doce-Kedoce around the corner is very nice too."
7356,1752740,1,RodrigoNunes,11/02/2022,Really great area but the treatment from the owner is lame. We stopped to clear grey and black water (3 €) and one of us decided to take a hot shower (that is 1€). But after entering in the shower the water became cold and the owner came to us laughing and asking if something happened because he shut it down as the hot water (even if paid) is just for residents. It is really a shame.
7356,1730878,5,man89,09/01/2022,Passage only to use the services. Everything is clean and available for 3 €. The lady who greeted us was very nice :)

By bike, the same but continue along the paths suitable for motor vehicles. In short, we thought we would spend a night and we took advantage of three nights of rest and three very pleasant days."
7356,1569166,5,Archelon5,11/09/2021,"Everything is great for 10 €, with a heated and salted pool! Prefer the Apolonia supermarket for its fresh products and take-out meals. Aldi on the left by the main road 30 seconds by bike, Apolonia on the right 5 minutes ..."

7356,1218371,5,benibeni,25/05/2021,"A spectacular site I do not give 5 stars if not 10 stars. The few comments of critics that I have seen is because they are not a motor coach, to have all the services one leaves a hotel and pay 60 and not 8 as in this area. I wish there were many areas like this."

As for the facilities, it has electricity, water and drainage of fecal and gray. Near an area with bars, restaurants and an Aldi that makes your stay easier.

7356,1027446,3,T61,05/09/2020,"Attention this place has no toilets! If you don’t have your own toilet you are not allowed to stay. Mixed feelings about this one. We came with a van and paid 13 Euros to stay overnight. The attendant Jan made an effort to be very helpful and friendly but when we went to look for the toilets he asked if we have our own and said then he will refund us since we can not stay. Then he said ok we can stay for that night only. Checkout is at 11am and since we had our hotel booked with 4pm checkin I asked in the morning if I can pay 5 Euros more to park until 4pm, we did not use pool showers etc but it was not possible. Not much shade but water and electricity available."

7356,1008058,5,DavidGarrido,27/08/2020,"Magnificent site, wonderful attention, and a very pleasant site. To go to the beaches you need to move your car and in some coves in August parking is complicated, or you move by bike or motorcycle. The site is highly recommended. An experience that I recommend, going to the beach in the middle of the afternoon, people leave and you see the calmer sunset"
7356,979225,1,vitoperruna,18/08/2020,"Before going, call or send an email as there are few places. A pity, I do not put more stars because I have not been but it looks good."

7356,898838,2,Motorhomefun,25/07/2020,"Seemed like a nice place if you're just a couple but for families it's not good value as  they charge per child even if they are 2 years old! As its not a campsite and just an Aire, we found it cost prohibitive with 3 kids. We didn't stay."
7356,882386,5,Benke5,19/07/2020,"Super great campsite. The owners were convincing because they are very nice and open-minded. The process was smooth and courteous. You can stand here for a few days.

Almost the same when reservations are not planned. Result: to hope to spend a week or 2, you have to go there then turn around for several days without guarantee that a place will become available. More conviviality. Pity !"

7356,259766,5,daphy,27/05/2018,"A very nice area, very clean, well located, very friendly, very rare to find this kind of area, nice to stay."
7356,256100,1,Pedrenko,20/05/2018,"The place is tidy, pool is clean, operator is nice, but not fair. Service costs 3 €, for 1 € you can take a cold shower for 5 minutes, toilets are not available, for children are charged 4 € extra. We arrived in the evening and spent two nights here and wanted to leave the place around noon. Unfortunately it was already after 11 o'clock, it was settled for three nights. The indication of 7 € / 24h is not correct, you have to leave the place before 11am."
7356,246259,5,Opium2804,05/05/2018,I confirm very clean area. Very warm welcome by Yann who always has a kind word and who is very attentive to the well being of his customers. Congratulations again and thank you Yann.
7356,238683,4,delort,20/04/2018,"Certainly the best motorhome area in Portugal. Very well maintained. Very clean. Very calm. At Human scale. Only downside, no toilet. We get used to it. By cons, shower 1 €. Dish trays, laundry tub, washing machines. Plus, nice little heated pool. Proximity to all shops. Beach about 1.5 km. 7 € per night without electricity with 2 € more. Very nice stay."

7356,231967,1,Deutschespaar,01/04/2018,Rather a parking space! Shower costs extra - sometimes cold. We were on the good reviews-were very disappointed. The manager was very rude to us. We did not get an invoice - we got bills all over Portugal! This parking lot has no toilets! The laundry is also very expensive. Beach is very far away. NO BUYING RECOMMENDATION ;-)
7356,227219,4,Trouy,12/03/2018,"Nice little corner. We are flat and on small pebbles. Very clean in case of bad weather, and there is everything you need. See even more! Like in a campsite! Very warm welcome"

7356,224883,1,sweden,26/02/2018,"Fotos dont tell real story.unfortunately we were not reading the other bad comments before arrive. this is not a camper site. it is a parking lot with no toilets and one hot shower for everyperson. you have to pay for shower. Manager not friendly-italian - too arrogant and fake smile. far from beach. no invoice, no taxes possible to pay on income, big problem.We all subsidise this business twice."
7356,222363,1,macladen,11/02/2018,"Really disappointed. After all the good reviews we thought this would be a good site, but the reality is different. 7€ per night (very small pitch - our vehicle barely fitted and we only have 6.94m long). 9€ including electricity. 3€ for grey and fresh water. NO TOILETS! ONLY 1 hot shower for both men and women. It costs 1€ for the hot shower. The water is cold for the first minute, so you have 4mins of lukewarm water to clean yourself. If you are lucky, you only have to wait 30 mins to get a shower, otherwise up to an hour wait. Make sure you put your towel on the seat outside otherwise someone else will jump in front of you. 5€ to use washing machine - way too expensive for the small size. 3.50€ for the dryer. The clothes don‘t get dried properly. Also too expensive. TV not working properly - bad quality picture. Pool table overused and almost unplayable. No bar, and no camper community that uses the recreation room. Campsite dead at 6pm. Nordics have taken over the site - they are nice, but I don’t know why they like this place ! The shops are a good 10mins away and the good restaurants much further - no problem with an e-bike (hilly terrain). Staff were ok, but nothing to write home about. There are many great free ‚sites‘ along the coast that are beautiful. After two nights we decided to move to the coast about 2kms away and nearer the beach and the city, for free. This part of Portugal is very safe so we never had issues and the police have no problem with wild camping in this area."
7356,221851,4,delavegaRT,07/02/2018,"Hi all, we were gone but arrived there we have not found a place but the air looked very nice and the owner too because he speaks French, I recommend you anyway. (Christine and Robert)"

Came for one night and stayed seven. Just a nice feel all round."
7356,191319,4,juziocesx,08/09/2017,"Good deal. But we decided to leave in the morning after 11 (departure time), if they do not charge another day, and we spent 1h because the beach is far away and Pablo the owner said he only charged us one day even if we had spent 1h There was a problem, another worker was bent on charging us 2 days. Call the owner and problem solved. If you go with children to the beach it is far I emphasize."

We went with two children aged 8 and 12 and the pool was a success. Walking to the beach, it is a bit far away to go with gear, but if you go with a towel and slippers it is a very pleasant walk. In the pools there is a place of hammocks and puff."

But cold ... The man treated us phenomenally and we arrived at ten o'clock at night, there is no toilet but there is a water load and waste discharge area, there is a supermarket about 500 meters away from the beach and the beach about 1 km away, cliff beach and cove. The best area of ​​motorhomes that I have seen, we came for a day and we have three and we are still here ... Greetings."

When we finished we put 3 euros in a mailbox that is there just as the sign said. When we left, a man with a bad appearance arrived and told us that we were not spending the night even though we told him that we had already paid. Cool place but very unpleasant staff."

7356,167323,4,deoliveira.ed,06/08/2017,"Still a great place, but for a big family, it might be a little expensive. We came with friends who had a family of 3 children, including one under 2 years old. If you count correctly, that’s €14/24 hours. It's okay for a day. Sorry. I think children shouldn't pay or at least not like an adult or from a certain age."

7356,33116,4,lilette183,06/04/2015,We spent a quiet night there and we will return with pleasure. The owners are warm and welcoming. They live in the house next door which is practical because it allows babysitting. The pitches are spacious and in addition we were able to enjoy the swimming pool. The alley through which it is accessed is narrow. It is better to have a scooter for travel because all the large areas are far away.
7356,27762,5,Mure,14/10/2014,"Spectacular area, worth visiting. Approximately 1.5 km from the beach, but it is well worth the walk to the beach to visit this wonderful area (for me the best I have seen)."

7356,7316,4,stouff74,02/08/2013,"A great service area with a warm welcome, the owner speaks French. The only problem on the table is that we have to empty the cassettes near the sink where we do the dishes and the toilets are missing. For €6.50/24 hours, there is nothing to say."

A little more hygiene in the services would be nice. The beach …. Small and walkable. It's really not my campsite. In these large campsites with space they could create an adult area, we would all win."

Water loading and unloading is at the entrance of the campsite, very easy and practical. It has a supermarket next to the reception, there are always people available 24 hours a day in case you have any mishaps or questions. We will repeat for sure. We were 5 people, cost €32 per day. Recommended 100x100."
7400,3204192,3,FEDRIGO,23/08/2023,"Great campsite but problem with electricity. Little power as a result of the fridge which cuts out, air conditioning which cuts out etc… never arrived in 3 weeks in the previous campsites. Wi-Fi non-existent. The convenience store is overpriced."

7400,2769571,5,MF1,20/05/2023,With ASCI you get a  large pitch with electric and water on pitch. Very clean showers and toilets - we were in Zone P - it is a very large camping site but with the zone layout it seems smaller - the area we were in was very flat but I did notice Zone H is hilly - but H is nearer beach
7400,2644474,1,KJFO,06/04/2023,"The most strangest layouts of a campsite I’ve ever seen. Don’t bother asking, there’s no answer because everything is on a QR code. Toilets are 100’s of meters away. Grocery far away. Restaurant layout it very basic. Downhill, so kids struggle to bicycle. WiFi signal is bad! No seriously, 112 euros for two nights, 2 adults, 2 kids with this is too much."

The lights in the sanitary facilities are not switched on until about 10:30 p.m., but then stay on all night... All in all, recommended!"

The pool is beautiful and the beach (stone beach) a real adventure, highly recommended! The bathing houses are very clean and the supermarket is very well stocked."
7400,2354582,4,penngann,09/09/2022,friendly campsite staff. average restaurant. shaded but far from all. So it is better to have an alternative means of transport (bicycle) otherwise you have to take the truck out.
7400,2243209,2,ceyalsg,15/08/2022,Campsite very expensive for the services offered. We paid €57 for 2 people and a 20-month-old baby for a not-so-great location and especially no paddling pool for my son. So yes easy access to the beach but that's all. Yes pleasant staff at the reception but it is their job.
7400,2206537,1,carolinannguaq,09/08/2022,"We arrived at 9.30 pm quite desperate for a place to stay. We’d been searching for hours but all places were full - we’ve never experienced this for the past months traveling through Europe. They charged us over 72€ for less than 12 hours. We were given a spot in their dump area, with trains passing by every few minutes and just by the highway. 72€!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Even their shop was closed when we arrived so they had nothing to offer but a piece of gravel to sleep on. Don’t go there it’s the crappies site ever seen and way way way too expensive - totally overpriced!!!!!!! DONT GO THERE!"
7400,2174386,2,fabmobil34,04/08/2022,"Tourist factory… very friendly welcome but overcrowded swimming pool and the beach is in fact only a little pebbly, pitches not great for 64€ per night (2 adults and 1 10-year-old child)!"
7400,2128947,3,Bullibastler,27/07/2022,"If you like the highway and train noise, this is the place for you. Otherwise it's a pretty little campsite by the sea."
7400,2048905,5,asiereibon,08/07/2022,Camping highly recommended and in the process of expansion. Very clean and very well attended and with great activities during the day and very good entertainment. Climate without too much heat
7400,2000547,5,Soham108,22/06/2022,"Stayed in the Caddy for 1 night and it was perfect! Quiet pitch, everything very clean, all pools open (pools also suitable for the little ones). The staff was very friendly and the lady at the front desk even spoke German. We were shown a selection of possible parking spaces on the map and were then allowed to drive there ourselves, choose and then let them know. Perfect!"
7400,1984840,5,DieMahlerts,17/06/2022,"At the beginning of May only the small pool was open. Free choice of pitch, good access to a bay, very clean sanitary facilities. Well suited for children. Price is fair but not cheap."
7400,1953894,4,Jesika09,06/06/2022,"Very good facilities, large pools. standard plots are large, perfect for AC of 7M +/-. The AC area is far from the restaurants/pool area and beach. Direct access to the beach. Gym of the best I've seen in a campsite. The bad thing is that they don't have staff to attend the restaurant and they don't give lunches/dinners without a reservation... there is also nothing nearby to be able to eat without moving the AC."
7400,1698242,2,OttoKurt,26/11/2021,They have been closing in October since 2020. ACSI should do a better job there and not just sell their book every year without further research. I only give 2 stars because the campsite operator is complicit.

7400,1634270,4,jouwmobilhome.be,09/10/2021,"Stayed for a stopover in August, on our way down. Camping to populated to our taste, facilities all well maintained. Do take into account that the amusement program runs to midnight with fireworks at the end. The beaches are spotless and well maintained."
7400,1620021,5,HansEngl,01/10/2021,"Really good campsite. Price performance is right. But the autobahn and the train, just as loud as at the autobahn rest area. Is no longer open all year, closes on October 17th."
7400,1600518,5,escalografo,22/09/2021,"Fantastic campground at this time of year. 38e two nights with electricity. Nice staff. Excellent showers. Large, clean pools, open until the 26th. Well-stocked supermarket. We don't use restaurant, but good cafeteria. Access to two coves and the Camí de Ronda, 4km from Ametlla de Mar. Quiet and with good plots. We will definitely return if we pass through the area."
7400,1582898,5,linaxwee,16/09/2021,"Super nice campsite! Stayed 2 nights and paid just under 40 €! Value for money is excellent. 3 pools, restaurant, diving school, bar and you are right on the beach! Sanitary facilities and parking spaces are super clean. Would come back here again and again."
7400,1575026,5,JustySoniaenruta,13/09/2021,Our first stay with an AC at this campsite. Absolutely satisfactory. Huge plot. Sufficient power outlet. Very clean services. Efficient and friendly staff. We will be back for sure.
7400,1541441,2,Erick19,02/09/2021,"Narrow pitches, trees everywhere, supplement of 3 euros per day to have another location to receive satellite but the wifi is not that, swimming pool and restaurant far by the sea, take a bike, no deckchairs (covid) beautiful synthetic lawn but hard. 3 km from the city center. we don't stay long."
7400,1516720,3,keizpetan,26/08/2021,"Multi-service coastal campsite. Two stone coves. Swimming pools. Although large, quiet. There is nothing wrong with a few days on the beach. The GR92 route along the coast passes through it."
7400,1442545,1,ekinet,12/08/2021,"Disgusted !! We booked a space in AC and when we arrived, the space they reserved for us was tiny, a camper barely entered, of the 70m it should have ... I don't think it exceeded 20m, they tried to give us a solution but they were just as bad. We still had to beg for the € 60 of the reservation, shameful, we left and we will not return."
7400,1388921,5,Jg91,01/08/2021,Very nice campsite. Location for motorhomes very good. Clean sanitary facilities and a very nice swimming pool.

7400,1228202,5,ValenPino,31/05/2021,"Good situation, coves very close, very correct services. Super large pitches. In this age, it is first class. Large pools and good supermarket. All the services. With Acsi card, it's worth it."
7400,1201055,3,Nadine7790,16/05/2021,"The complex is clean and has everything you need, the pool is very well maintained. The sanitary facilities could be renewed and there are many bungalows and so all campers are a bit on top of each other, but the pitches are big enough. In my opinion too expensive, 39.40 for 2 nights"
7400,1054153,5,SaraGA,17/09/2020,"We stayed two nights in a large plot. Very quiet on these dates, clean facilities and with everything you need. The best is the proximity to the coves. Good quality / price"
7400,1048118,5,JRM64,14/09/2020,Perfect camping to spend a weekend. Animation. Cleansed. The treatment is very friendly. Near the coves with transparent water. I recommend following the GR of the coast to discover the coves. Highly recommended. We will be back for sure.
7400,1016178,4,Led_ip,31/08/2020,"Large campsite with very good services. Two drawbacks: the animations are at full volume and can be annoying; at night you can hear the train and the road. rest, perfect!"
7400,873713,4,amikoj,16/07/2020,A very well equipped and very clean campsite. The staff is very nice and helps you in everything you want to know. With the ACSI card it is worth it. I will repeat
7400,836977,5,jaunrrg,26/06/2020,Very good camping.
7400,750672,4,Helton,06/12/2019,All reception staff friendly and welcoming - multi lingual so very easy to communicate. Very peaceful in the motorhome parking nearest to the beach - some noise from road   railway line but not enough to disturb. Beautiful coastline to walk and coves to discover. Toilet   shower block clean and warm (in December) and daily bread delivery and mini supermarket at reception much appreciated!
7400,576079,1,marcopolo1234,26/07/2019,"Camping quite expensive and very noisy, party on the beach all night !!!!! Unbearable in high season."
7400,489025,5,Wolf23,21/05/2019,"Very nice clean campsite with 2 very beautiful stalls, ideal for hiking on the coast. Very clean toilets. Friendly, so everything is too. Price 28 € for campers with 2 people and 2 dogs without electricity. Unfortunately you can hear the highway at night"
7400,426294,4,DerSonneHinterher,02/02/2019,Friendly. Nice facility. Clean. Shower water was lukewarm. Rail and highway to hear well. In early December (six days on site) we had strong cool wind.
7400,425925,5,barou,31/01/2019,"We went there, we just wanted to do the services. Very nice home with a smile. For the small sum of 3 € we could do them, very clean and very practical station.the top when we do the wild;)"
7400,421007,5,wollo_butz,07/01/2019,"Stayed here for 4 nights at the end of December. The CP was as good as empty and only distressed. Everything was clean and the nature around is really nice, you can walk along the coast or even bathe in one of the bays."
7400,391194,3,CriviR6,11/10/2018,"Camping correct. Maybe we coincided with a birthday of a few Britons altered, referring to the rest, the correct services, supermarket very well, garbage smelling very bad and exceeded the containers, if you are near the tracks the train is noticeable but it bothered me more the noise of the nearby highway. The large pools, fine restaurant, setting, coves and GR great."
7400,382171,5,spitz042@gmail.com,25/09/2018,Very clean with a mini beach just below the campsite ....
7400,283383,5,jonandv,08/07/2018,"Something not right with the description. This is a massive purpose built campsite with all the facilities. If you enter from the North, there’s no height restrictions (not sure about the South). Just parked our 11m long (3.8m high RV) on the campsite. No problems."
7400,136287,2,jordi_iorgos,21/05/2017,Camping very close to the rocky coves and road GR.92. Is very large. Correct services The new zone does not have much shadow. Large pools It is divided in two by a small road. The light connections are not very good. The automatics jump constantly. Little power
7400,117026,5,Hanou,29/12/2016,"An incredibly friendly reception, low ASCI fares, an extremely clean campsite, and nice squares, lovely walks and dogs are welcome"

7463,3133898,1,PPedrosa,13/08/2023,"The first night spent in this place, we were woken up at 6 am by the GNR, according to them the place is not authorized for overnight stays as it is covered by the coastline plan. Also, a lot of noise from the nearby beach bar."
7463,3088605,3,Osnam,06/08/2023,"very large site with some movement. has toilet and water. the night was not quiet, too much noise."
7463,3040258,4,claratomschi,29/07/2023,the night can be a bit winding here. free toilet — clean. the view is gorgeous. there is also a bar nearby. beach and town within walking distance.

7463,2928134,5,Quicolas,05/07/2023,"Perfect spot to visit this interesting town with very cool beaches and a wide gastronomic offer and many lively places. The week of the sardines is wonderful, occupying a nearby car park for the 15th day of July only during the day, but with great and accurate criteria, the mu icupality has enabled it for us and our overnight stay."
7463,2744829,3,guirardi,12/05/2023,"Good place to spend the night or more, there is a restaurant nearby and a public restroom that works during the day. It has no services. It can be very windy."
7463,1483517,3,DariaB,19/08/2021,"We also spent a night there. Agreed with the previous comment, the music from the beach bar (as well as drunk people) was a bit of an issue. However having dinner with the sunset view was priceless."
7463,1461615,1,carlman06,15/08/2021,"Complement to my previous comment after a night spent I strongly advise against sleeping there and others around Music coming from the beach bar (a band orchestra) nearby very very very loud until 2 am, impossible to sleep. I don't know if it's every day or only Saturday but anyway we left and will never sleep here again."
7463,1455712,3,carlman06,14/08/2021,"Very large car park, beach 50m away, calm, asphalt, WC, showers at the beach, shops and restaurants"
7463,1095526,2,ktt19998,16/10/2020,"Beautiful view but very weird town, basically most of the high rise apartments are abandoned. Maybe it was just out of season but we got a bad vibe and didn't want to stay the night"
7463,873233,4,Arlindo,16/07/2020,"it is an excellent park, and very well situated, which is always empty and which could be used by the municipality to make an ASA, even at a reasonable price"
7463,873190,4,Arlindo,16/07/2020,Excellent by the sea absolute tranquility toilets and water tap
7463,513883,4,tommieslav,13/06/2019,"Nice spot, some areas seem to be less exposed to the wind here. We arrived yesterday and went to the nearby location first. Due to heavy wind we moved here. Very quiet night. Sound of the ocean in the background."
7463,390880,2,jm85,10/10/2018,"Roofed parking we spent the night in a quiet, bar and restaurant nice public WC nearby"
7463,137177,5,pierreo74,24/05/2017,And that's why we are rejected by some municipalities. The uncomfortable of some campers who confuse parking and camping. Those of some Nordic countries do elsewhere what they would not do at home .... See photo.
7463,50012,2,welcome53,17/08/2015,"Great place to spend a night overlooking the sea, everything on the premises, wc clean, shower, beach, baker, bar."

7472,3257621,3,Reales,04/09/2023,Maximum stay time: max. 2 nights Number of places: 20 Amount to pay and services included: Low season: €5/night. High season (June 15-September 15): €12/night
7472,3151869,1,Leila10,15/08/2023,"Dirt, poorly leveled, people take more space than they should. The land is dirty and the water source is clogged. The only good thing is that it is close to the beach."
7472,3044815,2,OriolPuy,30/07/2023,"It is in a good place, but the people are rude and occupy more than one square with the awning, tables and even having barbecues without any intention of removing it and leaving space. This means that the parking is reduced to about 14 spaces for these uncivils."
7472,3010720,4,sunlita,24/07/2023,Correct services and quiet night. In the morning they check that you have paid. (You pay at the tourist office) The Services work correctly.
7472,3007484,4,RuliVanLife,23/07/2023,"These places are really appreciated, although we couldn't spend the night because people take out tables occupying several places... a shame. We spent the night in the upper car park very well."
7472,2990332,4,nathdam,20/07/2023,"To recommend, close to the beach, a lot of passage during the day, we did not stay there at night, water and drainage available, for the water plan the right connection because push button. It remains a fairly flat but dusty terrain. In any case, thanks to my city of Sant Feliu which makes this type of land available to us."
7472,2958440,4,oguiri,13/07/2023,recommendable. You can park first and then go to the tourist office to get your ticket. the empty and water in good condition. quiet place behind the bus station
7472,2791285,4,LaPrimastar,27/05/2023,Quiet area with water filling and emptying services. It costs €5 per day to be paid at the information point! Now it is located on Rambla 22. The town is very beautiful
7472,2738901,5,HayleyK,10/05/2023,"Excellent aire, €5 per night payable at tourist information centre in town. Fresh water tap in the corner near the grey waste emptying and black waste disposal with water tap in the middle at the side. Lovely town, great bars and eateries. I would definitely recommend it. However if you use the upper car park it is free"
7472,2728397,5,sun1,06/05/2023,"Very good place calm no problems, market on Sunday which is in walking distance we stayed 2 nights."
7472,2711211,4,deliawestbury,30/04/2023,If you are lucky enough to get in here you will have a peaceful night. The location is good and the beach and all the bars and restaurants are many. The port is a nice walk/ cycle from here. We paid our 5 euros at the tourist information place otherwise the local police call and check on vehicles. The top parking - yes it is free but it’s also shared with cars. Good market on Sundays
7472,2629474,3,veronijojo,29/03/2023,we also slept above not really glamorous it helps out service below on the area
7472,2626038,3,Macotililo42,27/03/2023,"no more space in the parking lot, so we spent the night on the one above. Attention, presence of spikes at the bottom of the car park."
7472,2624692,3,GerardNicoleCH,26/03/2023,There were no more places so we slept in the free parking lot above. Quiet night but in the morning a lot of cars come
7472,2604178,4,EmyBikeWorldPiera,09/03/2023,It is very flat and very quiet at night. Just behind them they were working on construction and they work on Sundays. otherwise super good
7472,2596686,3,deceneu,03/03/2023,"Okish place. Calm and peaceful. I give it 3 stars as it has just 1 source of water right next to the WC empty place used also on WCs. That water source does not have a thread, so water can be filled up only with a bucket. For a paid place it lacks some of the basic amenities which one could find in anyother free aire"
7472,2563671,3,Albert-PM,29/01/2023,Quiet area in January. Drainage of water. 5 minutes from the promenade.
7472,2524431,5,Belen_69,19/12/2022,quiet area with decent water change
7472,2514490,2,Carthago-nl,06/12/2022,"A large high parking garage has been put in front. No more views of the city. The only advantage now is reasonably close to the center, but nice standing has disappeared. Been coming here for 10 years now but now looking for something else."
7472,2307933,5,duca28,27/08/2022,magnificent area that the town provides us in high season is €12 and you pay at the tourist information point of which you can visit the history museum and climb the tower for free I give them a 10 for creating spaces for our mobile homes
7472,2278138,3,normandyx,21/08/2022,"Be careful when climbing the entrance it floats, drain not very accessible with the water away. We pay 12€ per night at the tourist office, I don't know if anyone is passing... Lack of maintenance but slept well all the same. Less than 10 min walk from the beach and the center"
7472,2271339,2,FranBravo,20/08/2022,Non-existent pedestrian access. Around under construction and not very accessible with a baby stroller or wheelchair. Well located. Water filling and emptying service
7472,2194163,1,cosyblois,07/08/2022,"Flee theft. noise. dusty the city no longer welcomes motorhomes like a few years ago, too bad"
7472,2174785,1,bitxarraca,04/08/2022,"A.C. very poor any kind of services except emptying gray water. the price of 12 euros is abusive for the installation. You can't empty Chemistry and if you don't have a solar panel. We have verified that they don't want us on the Costa Brava, they prefer hotels or campsites. We also consume. like any tourist, ultimately it's a shame."
7472,2172160,5,juanmaypepina,04/08/2022,"We have seen the truth as we passed by, there was room but we only needed to refuel and pour black and gray water. It's the only thing we did not stop the engine. The truth is that they helped us because the outlet was narrow for the tap and we didn't have any. But there was a shaded site and it was well leveled."
7472,2089824,3,judithmy,18/07/2022,Close to the center and the beach. Short distance from the tourist office to the car park but curve without sidewalk for chairs so you have to go a bit by road. €12/day and maximum 2 days in high season. The guy at the tourist office is super nice and comes over with the dataphone or leaves a note to pay on it. Opposite there is a construction site for a 3-storey car park that works on Sundays.
7472,2015263,3,RebecaRubio,27/06/2022,"we did only the emptying of grays. wonderful that the city council puts these sites. However, I saw little shade... a lot of construction... too much rubbish nearby... and we went to sleep at Wecamp Santa Cristina for 23 euros with a pool and showers"
7472,1987439,3,volpologia,18/06/2022,"Good place to leave the AC during the day and go to the beach, discharge gray water and load water, noisy during the day because there is a construction site in front"
7472,1837383,2,gon943,19/04/2022,"Would I leave my ACs here alone after reading some theft reviews? NO, especially when we returned at night, there was total darkness. Why were we more ACs, if not, we're leaving. However, I thank the San Feliu de Guixols town hall for the ""attempt"" to make us comfortable. Can it be easier to make a transfer than to pay at the branch? There is a separate tap with thread, almost hidden."
7472,1823954,4,Christianschiffers,15/04/2022,"Super good place, about 400 m from the beach. Pay € 5 per day without electricity at the tourist office. Perfect."
7472,1810894,5,Cargoleta,08/04/2022,"Very well located, lack of maintenance but it is appreciated that there are places like this! Go to the Tourist Office and pay, like good catavanists. Many demand but when it comes to paying they act clueless."
7472,1804873,3,benedicte,03/04/2022,"Free during this period, at the end of March, as well as the services. Convenient to go to the center but not terrible. welcoming city and tourist office at the top."
7472,1711008,4,Carthago-nl,16/12/2021,we have been coming here for years and (fortunately) we do not have that burglary experience. it will certainly occur like in other places and camping sites and hotels. Municipality can indeed do some maintenance. they also get money for this. but close to town and beach is also worth something. bus station in front of the door has pros and cons. indeed there is some traffic noise but it is not a highway.
7472,1703181,2,Fresia,04/12/2021,After paying 2 days of overnight stay we did not stay. We saw clear signs of insecurity and the 3 motorhomes that we were there ended up leaving. It is a shame because the site and the town are well worth a visit.
7472,1625932,3,javeasteve5,04/10/2021,"Stayed one Sunday night, bit cramped, not especially level, services working, we did not use but others did. Reasonable central for walks and town but being able to see exit, noticed several 7m + vehicles leave and bottoming out as rear wheels hit road.  We managed to not bottom out after seeing this, so it can be done. 7 others vehicles stayed night so felt secure."

7660,2666370,3,KILIANBERGA,13/04/2023,"I had a very quiet night. Thanks to Benicàssim for arranging this place for us. In a walk you are in the village, with all the services."
7660,2658462,4,Arandia,10/04/2023,"We only used it for water changes. Although it is next to the road, everything is very good."
7660,2645921,4,chantaldante,07/04/2023,Free service area along the road very convenient. We did what was necessary and got back on the road because the parking area was full.
7660,2642601,5,Lcofo05,06/04/2023,"Good area to spend the night in the middle of the route, you don't deviate much from the road. There are many motorhomes."
7660,2640098,3,Marclashter,04/04/2023,"area very close to the road. Many are parked and very close together, with almost no room for manoeuvres. The recharging point when there is a queue is very close to the road, when we arrived it loaded an ac with a trailer it went out onto the road. Well it's free."
7660,2635969,5,Yi_ita,02/04/2023,Totally free services. Clean water tap with high pressure. There is a sand ledge where AC is parked but less than 200m away there is an asphalt parking lot next to a children's area that allows you to spend the night 24 hours and they let the AC fit even though it is quite flat.
7660,2631886,4,alien62,31/03/2023,"convenient for going to the city which is very pretty, places a bit narrow and limited by trees and lampposts for long campers, the queue will have difficulty at the back. automatic laundry immediately after the tunnel"
7660,2631881,3,alien62,31/03/2023,"the unloading is on the street, inconvenient to get in line. the nearby parking is just enough, dirt and downhill. the good one is 70 meters away"
7660,2618116,4,Pepita6x6,21/03/2023,Perfect dump point! We didn't sleep here. Just tank taught and water refilled!
7660,2616671,1,viajesporcumplir,20/03/2023,"Horrible, all night the dogs barking! Add to this the noise of the cars. Place to load and unload but not to sleep and rest!"
7660,2592071,1,Jean-ClaudeGERMON,26/02/2023,actually horrible place unless the incessant barking of dogs doesn't bother you. explanations: the owner does not live there but leaves his dogs. He is also the mayor's cousin.
7660,2579125,5,tatooniki,16/02/2023,I see a lot of reviews but I liked it here parking lot found by chance pcq the others were full good like the others stuck on top of each other but you can hear life here the music the dogs the sports players personal I love it's living the shops are not far restaurants there is the mountain and the sea not far in any case I would come back
7660,2569003,5,beatrice5919,05/02/2023,Thanks to the municipality... on the side of the road (where very few cars pass) nothing dangerous! don't worry .... glass bell and garbage 50 meters back where there is the 24h parking area
7660,2568996,5,beatrice5919,05/02/2023,asphalted parking with a maximum stay of 24 hours. Nearby there is a short tunnel that takes you to a main street where there is a supermarket selling bread and restaurants. At the exit of the tunnel there is a launderette and a splendid shop Ophelia. The C / S is convenient. Near there are dogs barking but I didn't hear them at night. Thanks to the municipality a perfect and free quick stop
7660,2564986,3,mymyl,31/01/2023,Free but filling/emptying at the roadside. Very dangerous. No trash. Avoid as much as possible.
7660,2564970,1,mymyl,31/01/2023,"How awful ! And nothing to drain or fill. Stuck between two roads, I won't even stop there to eat a sandwich."
7660,2558959,5,elgriegonet,23/01/2023,Along the side of the road. It's perfect. Thanks to the municipality. There are many parking spaces here. 4G coverage Yoigo and Orange 2/4
7660,2554642,1,denmo,18/01/2023,there are much nicer and better places. you should be happy if you can open your door. of course not overnight.
7660,2553467,1,lebourguignon,16/01/2023,We tried to stop there for the night. Impossible. Arrived at 6:30 p.m. absolutely every corner was busy!!!! Not possible to park next because bans everywhere .... It's January 16 so what to think? Is the gratuity offered by the municipality a good thing?
7660,2549052,1,poirier,11/01/2023,"impossible to sleep at night or block your ears because the dogs in the house next door bark all night, more cars are parked there and it doesn't bother anyone"
7660,2533775,4,Edgardetnous,30/12/2022,Free to fill and empty Large flow Thank you to the municipality
7660,2532183,5,Aimpe,29/12/2022,"Perfect parking for visiting the town and going on the green route from Benicàssim to Oropesa. Right next to the area, which was full"
7660,2521492,4,lingualizer,14/12/2022,"Quite ok for 1 or 2 nights. The spaces are tight, but if everyone sticks to the markings, it's fine. Longer campers have a hard time getting into the gaps. Good for exploring the city or visiting one of the restaurants."
7660,2517159,4,SusanaStier,09/12/2022,"Spent a good night here. It was very busy though and a little noisy from the street. Nearby is the Bodega Carmelitano, which comes highly recommended. I'll check them out next time. The pedestrian zone is also not far away and attracts with all its bars and cafés... Many thanks to the community!"
7660,2509998,4,Himla,01/12/2022,Thanks for this place so I could empty toilet and grey water
7660,2493685,4,Chcol89,13/11/2022,rare on this coast road we are happy to do the most free services at this place. We did not stay in the parking lot.
7660,2488167,4,Drownedrat,08/11/2022,"Free for 24 hours, with free grey and black waste disposal and water just up the road in the next layby. Town centre just the other side of the road    through the underpass though the beach is a little further.
Dogs noisy early evening and again at 5:30, quiet after."
7660,2483275,4,sowdendave,05/11/2022,"free water, toilet drop and grey drop what more could you want .
bit rustic"
7660,2465384,4,MyriamSauter,27/10/2022,"thanks to the municipality for providing everything you need. Nice asphalted, illuminated and well-kept parking. The only negative thing is the road (but at night there is hardly any traffic) and the dogs .. so many dogs that started barking in the middle of the night .."
7660,2429081,5,silviapenachao,07/10/2022,Thanks to the town hall for providing us with everything we need and for free. To some @ who put some inconvenience you already know that there are campsites..... We will return.
7660,2409009,3,MC4333,28/09/2022,Does its job. Emptying and filling. Thank you Benicassim The beach is wonderful.
7660,2366271,4,T5van84,13/09/2022,"Perfect for services, good flow for filling accessible heavy goods vehicles our 12m passed without problem"
7660,2357590,3,tiroseno,10/09/2022,Wide seats. Well located. The only but was the barking of the dogs.
7660,2355023,4,Blaidelta,09/09/2022,Good for the council. There are ample places in this month. Without shadow. I think I'll eat and go after the nap
7660,2354648,4,Blaidelta,09/09/2022,"I found it, but it's very hot, I'm going to look for a Lidel... Please lift the lid for black water, there are people who do it in the gray water area"
7660,2339799,2,Mickex1,04/09/2022,this place is good except for the dogs that bark all night we had to get up at 5 this morning and go to a quieter place because the dogs barked so damned much so we got desperate and went on.
7660,2337440,1,NP7,04/09/2022,"To spend the day well (if you can park since the cars park where the cars), at night a disaster, all night the dogs barking non-stop, we left at 4 in the morning desperate (and that I am a trunk sleeping)"
7660,2268015,3,Baloo52,19/08/2022,"Good for a night or even two. Bins but no water disposal - not a criticism, just a comment to help others. Very short walk to Santa Tomas, the Main Street, with lots of bars and restaurants. Recommend."
7660,2243094,3,sandrido,15/08/2022,The free loading / unloading area is located adjacent to the dirt parking lot. Unfortunately it is on the side of the main road and therefore can be difficult during loading / unloading operations.
7660,2224181,3,thierryestelle,12/08/2022,"Impressive barking of the dogs when they bring the food, but it does not last. Finally had a quiet night"
7660,2132999,2,Estersanzp,27/07/2022,Small unshaded area. On the next street there is quite a lot of traffic that can be heard at night. Noise of dogs from the farm next door.
7660,2058737,3,Oscarfalgas,10/07/2022,"The dogs could be heard but they did not prevent us from sleeping. 20 places, 8 occupied by motorhomes and 12 occupied by cars."
7660,2055267,2,xavierfarras,09/07/2022,"area reserved for parking motorhomes. paved ground, with a slight unevenness. little shade. The idea is good, but the execution not so much. the emptying and filling area is higher up, right next to the road, occupying the mapen. free water. To the side there is a small esplanade of land but it is left and dirty."
7660,1961177,3,Claudio-44119,09/06/2022,"Passing through in June 2022, let's discover that the service terminal is not located in this car park but a little further up the street near a gravelled car park. Otherwise the pitches are not very large, suitable for a 6m vehicle."
7660,1949223,2,Belita.,05/06/2022,Good place to spend the night. Very close to the center. We parked fine. We spent the quiet night together with other ac. recommendable
7660,1907925,4,KaneloAntonio,22/05/2022,Very good paved area with loading and unloading area on the road before reaching the area near the town with laundry and restaurants very close to
7660,1882514,1,akawana,10/05/2022,"A horror area, in an ugly place, near some workshops, and you can only stay 24 hours. But the worst is the water change area, because it is on a hard shoulder! To fill the water, we had to be in a lane of the road, luckily it is not a very busy road..."
7660,1882336,3,txudens,10/05/2022,"It is not the ideal area to be, but it perfectly fulfills its function. There is a playground nearby, laundry and the center less than 5 minutes away to go out for a drink. the place of filling and emptying is following the road for about 70 meters, next to a small gravel parking lot"
7660,1843684,4,Eltorado,21/04/2022,"There are two places. One on the sand, you can stay there for up to 3 days with services. A bit further asphalted spaces next to the ""normal"" parking spaces, allowed up to 1 day. We used the next one. It was ok, but the dogs kept barking"
7660,1829728,1,Abelarra,17/04/2022,"In the farm that is next door there are a lot of dogs that are barking as soon as it dawns, a shame because the place is good."
7660,1827718,5,CanKerberus,16/04/2022,"quite well, it has gray and black discharge, fountain and leveled plots next to a plot of almond trees in an apparent state of abandonment, at the back of the farm there is a horse, which allows itself to be caressed."
7660,1805043,5,Anne2505,03/04/2022,"Very nice place! Place for 5/6 campers, located on a lawn with almond trees. There is a water tap. You do hear some noise from a nearby busier road and not all places are flat. You can stay here for a maximum of 72 hours (read in a booklet). Further along the same road there are more places in a parking lot where you can park for a maximum of 1 day."
7660,1787379,3,Didiousse,19/03/2022,Practical but cramped. Tight as sardines but especially permanent aggressive barking. How can animals be left screaming like this all day? The masters must be psychiatric cases! But thank you to the municipality for free and close to everything.
7660,1777073,1,Miguelmora,08/03/2022,misplaced coordinates
7660,1774763,4,JuanVillanuevaAlonso37,06/03/2022,"After I got kicked out of two sites I ended up spending the night in this RV park with my van. It was very crowded but I found a place. It seemed safe to me, I also passed the civil guard on two occasions, which gives even more security."
7660,1737603,3,JuMrt,20/01/2022,"no space in the CC car park forced to stand in the other car park, from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. there is a lot of traffic and you can clearly hear the road that passes next to it.. to all the same the merit of existing, and the laundry is really not far"
7660,1729768,3,xiberun,08/01/2022,"""Sardine box"" type parking but ideal for visiting the city and going to the restaurant. Otherwise a little further and in all the streets perpendicular to the beach you can sleep there peacefully and - almost - alone !! ;-)"
7660,1707864,3,fiveonroad,10/12/2021,"We had to sleep on the edge of the road next to the dirt area, everything was complete. Too much noise every time a vehicle passed. The perfect water and emptying service"
7660,1707797,4,elnavegante,10/12/2021,"Good place to park and spend the night, very close to the center of Benicasim, ideal for exploring its long beaches and beautiful forests such as the Las Palmas Desert. And with the proximity of supplying us in an area that is just 100 meters away. I am grateful to the city council that offers us the possibility of parking in this wonderful town."
7660,1706334,5,IngridMarti,08/12/2021,"We slept on the dirt side because it was all packed. It is super good, quiet, surrounded by motorhomes. Very very quiet night and just when leaving the land area, there is to fill and empty."
7660,1693099,4,Chcol89,19/11/2021,"'We went there this afternoon to do the services, 3 or 4 CCs are waiting their turn. Watch out for the road, it's not very safe but it's done, thank you."
7660,1686140,5,pjota,12/11/2021,Water service re established. No issues emptying nor filling up.
7660,1684472,5,gach,10/11/2021,We were able to empty fill park took the opportunity to go to the restaurant thank you to the municipality continue
7660,1678392,2,andAdam23,05/11/2021,"No water at all, draining of gray water only."
7660,1676059,1,jessy74,03/11/2021,This day neither drinking water nor water to wash the cassette. draining of used water only.
7660,1673684,4,Nostramo,01/11/2021,"The good thing is that it is close to the town of Benicassim. At least it exists and it is to be appreciated. the bad. Narrow and somewhat complicated spaces for a large motorhome. Of all the existing parking, the area with the steepest slope is the one for motorhomes. the correct water service area."
7660,1660013,5,MF1,24/10/2021,Lovely town with lots of restaurants - 2 km to beautiful beach - maximum stay 1 day on sign
7660,1638278,1,evacg,11/10/2021,"The area that is 200m away was full and we came here that for one night it is worth but no more. It is 2km from the greenway and it is a quiet residential area is the only good thing. Behind there is a house with a lot of dogs that barely bark during the day but at night at all hours and apart from that the national highway passes close by and you can hear the traffic. The noise doesn't usually bother me but it has been horrible in general. And it is also only parking, no services because logically they are in the area."
7660,1619422,2,Nutopica,01/10/2021,"The emptying and filling of water is up the slope of the land area (not on the asphalt) The asphalt squares have some slope and I think it is limited to 1 night. Next to the land area there is field, and 1 Farm with a pony that seemed neglected and without water (there were more animals too) I went to the Civil Guard barracks to report it, it is very close to the area, I encourage you to do the same"
7660,1555742,1,111222333444555666,07/09/2021,"Thank you to the municipality for giving us the opportunity to fill water for free, it is unfortunate not to specify which is the tap for the toilets and the one for drinking water, so I filled my bottles with children's parks located below. To sleep there: out of the question, between barking dogs, excrement, very noisy road 24/24, I prefer to continue my journey"
7660,1525352,4,amilpin080,28/08/2021,"Good loading and unloading area, just enough and necessary."
7660,1525350,3,amilpin080,28/08/2021,Cars take away parking. Little shade.
7660,1460129,5,AlexAurore2021,15/08/2021,This is a free motorhome parking lot. You can drain and fill the water for free. We stayed there for 2 night. There is a children's play area next door with a drinking water tap. The city is very lively. It is true that the back house has dogs that bark only in the morning (to believe it is done on purpose) but we heard them only one morning.
7660,1437314,3,sofines,11/08/2021,"Illuminated and asphalted with some slope but to rest en route it is good. The neighbor's dog is still alive, it is seen that the owner is deaf, by the high-pitched barking it is seen that he is a small dog and the goat suffers from insomnia …….,"
7660,1411457,3,Charlymovil,06/08/2021,"To fill and empty is fine, but to spend the night with the road next to it and the neighbor's dogs, there is a noise that cannot be slept, it is a pity that the municipalities when they do these areas do not think a little more about the conditions to be able to rest, it is very common to do these areas next to the roads, with my effort, interest and money it could be done better."
7660,1328309,3,txu-txu,16/07/2021,With inclination Impossible to sleep because of the barking of the dogs next door
7660,1281005,4,anaranjada,27/06/2021,"Asphalt parking, with a little shade. When you cross a street you are already in town, with bars, restaurants, a take away food store in less than 5 minutes, and also a laundry. If you walk to the beach it takes 15 minutes, it doesn't get tedious. At night it was filled with cars, and there is a license plate that says that this piece is ONLY for AC."
7660,1280814,5,angiefernando,27/06/2021,We have come to fill and empty waters and everything is great I recommend it
7660,1275296,1,SantiagoNavarro,25/06/2021,It is the festival of noise. We do not recommend.
7660,1267359,1,DRojas,20/06/2021,"We have arrived from Castellón and we have left. That cannot be considered an area, it is rather a secluded parking lot. We wanted to see, meet and dine in Benicasim, but it will not be."
7660,1213344,4,Crispi77,23/05/2021,"We spent the night and it was quiet. It is a parking lot with some noise, especially from the dogs of the house behind it. Quiet and safe."
7660,1211036,3,herrerocamper,22/05/2021,"We have come here because it says that it has water filling and gray water emptying services and it is incorrect, as a perfect parking lot but that detail has made us waste our time."
7660,1210822,3,LaLola_en_ruta,22/05/2021,Good to visit town.
7660,1203293,4,Foska,17/05/2021,We have slept very well despite the fact that dogs can be heard barking at times. What I have hallucinated is that this morning the police came to ask if we had slept well and if we needed anything we did not hesitate to call them.
7660,1176187,4,Kutter2,19/04/2021,Easy to drive off.
7660,1168430,4,RubCar,05/04/2021,"It is well located, less than 5 minutes walk from the street of restaurants and shops. Despite being very close to the road, you don't hear much noise. In all the streets around, it is forbidden to park Ac. The filling and draining terminal is 100 meters from the car park."
7660,1165656,3,lapocha,03/04/2021,"Good place to spend the night, bars where you can have tapas."
7660,1155101,3,Umeboshiman,21/03/2021,It fulfills its function of filling and emptying. thanks to the city council for providing the service

7660,1118397,3,surfingal,29/11/2020,Stayed here 2 nights in a storm. Every thing you want nearby. Good water pressure at the tap and toilet which is 100 meters South of the aire. Quiet through the night. Would think that the curfew assists here.
7660,1096098,4,chiquidita2003,17/10/2020,"We only sleep, to stop and spend the night is quite good, some noise from trucks, we do not fill and empty water, so I don't know how they are."
7660,990369,1,Esther2018,22/08/2020,"We arrived and it was all occupied by cars, the police came and told us that we hope someone leaves and that they would not issue a fine to the cars. In the end a car left and we were able to park, but in the house opposite there are many dogs barking all night, well, a festival and in the morning not one barked. I advise not to stay. Attached photo of the day."
7660,941751,2,memeloo,09/08/2020,"The place would not be bad to spend the night more but the vehicles do not respect the signs and park in the reserved spaces. On the other hand, the rest of the parking lot makes it prohibited to park ACs, which is very small. You only spend the night, so I cannot assess emptying and filling."
7660,905260,4,lidiamm,28/07/2020,"Very good and guarded place, quiet night, to put some but 1 there is a dog that either does not feel it or is barking all night and 2 that says that it is for AC and depends on the time you arrive there are a lot of cars and they don't say anything ......"
7660,889802,1,EduSola,22/07/2020,"Horrible, dogs from the house next door barking, and worst of all, the parking lot filled with cars of people who were partying and several ACs came and had to leave without being able to park. The police passed several times and they did nothing, when it clearly states that it is only for AC. They should do something with it. I give it 1 because it won't let me give it 0."
7660,833862,2,maryse13,23/06/2020,"There is no more water at the terminal, but stay overnight ok."

yes parking is tight but so it's a very handy little spot 
thanks to the Spanish people for allowing this here
but wish others wouldn't park taking up 4 spaces than they should 
not good"
7660,774678,3,chouchou85,31/01/2020,"Very tight parking on each other, it helps out for one night, the dogs bark a good part of the night"
7660,757357,1,mumdventure,27/12/2019,"Has the merit of existing. Ridiculously small, tight like sardines. Noises from the national road all night, horrible. Convenient only to help out if you are tired for the night, or if you need to go to the laundromat next door."
7660,754021,1,hymercamp,15/12/2019,It is a very small and noisy parking lot. We did not like it and left
7660,752538,1,bimi2261,11/12/2019,"The place is just loud, lots of traffic and a lot of dogs barking."
7660,749569,4,Bobstones,03/12/2019,"Good stop for water, if you have a rubber screw on connector the pipes work fine. The place was surprisingly busy both the gravel car park and tarmac bit slightly further down the road and it’s really not a very nice place to stay especially with plenty of places next to the beach so close. Nowt as queer as folk."
7660,745993,3,emjauk,22/11/2019,"The aire is the tarmac area, but the facilities are past the dirt area, just at the side of the road. Need a random connector for the water, we had fun getting it into our containers as the nozzle points forward.

Some people don't respect the rules. There is a MH permanently parked and a campervan that had tables chairs plus their washing hanging out. Vehicles driving through create  dust and although there's plenty of shade, the trees do drop a lot of stuff on your MH."

Interesting proximity to the nearby town. The negative point is that this area is right next to a fairly busy roundabout early in the morning.

But to be free... with water draining, what more could you ask for."
7882,2540846,3,sandrido,04/01/2023,Area completely full so we stayed overnight together with a dozen other campers in the large adjacent car park. Loading and unloading always comfortable and free. The town is worth a visit.

The area is very good, although it is usually full, thanks to its good location. But you can park in the large car park next door. If I have to look for a flaw, it would be the noise of cars from the streets that pass by the area"
7882,2506957,4,HeKl,27/11/2022,"Everything is there and working. Close to the city center. Quiet in the evening and the road was not disturbing. Unfortunately, there are still careless campers who leave the generator running all day and produce unnecessary noise and exhaust fumes. Next time please choose a spot with electricity and don't bother the others with noise. A wonderfully normal city with a large pedestrian zone to just be a bit."

8284,2573010,3,soerengoerlich,09/02/2023,"Nice place, but right on a busy road Sanitary facilities were clean but in poor condition. A supermarket is just around the corner and you can cycle to Cartagena. We were told that the place would be closed due to power problems and had to continue driving after 4 days. Unfortunately, I can't say whether the place is currently still open."
8284,2571404,5,CarstenTeeh,07/02/2023,"Everything is available that an adult needs in the daily routine. Shops, supermarkets, gas stations are in close proximity, the industrial area with shopping center, hardware store, etc. can be reached by bike. The operator (Teresa) is very friendly and helpful, for example with minor repairs, as are the supporting brothers. We will definitely be back here next winter."
8284,2564209,5,AreaCartagena,30/01/2023,"Hello, good morning. Today we are full and the signal and reception have been bypassed to go directly to an occupied plot. There are no free plots and if there is a gap it is because they have left to return in the afternoon. By the way, the comment about the other guests, whatever their nationality, is totally discriminatory and derogatory, including Spaniards who are certainly very comfortable."
8284,2564179,1,inmajh,30/01/2023,"It is normal for them to close during the summer months, it is full of long-term foreigners, I went on 1/30 and when there was parking they kicked me out. I have a profiled motorhome, and I am Spanish. Nor would I have stayed when I saw the atmosphere there"

8284,2548172,5,MichaelT2022,10/01/2023,"Great value for money, everyone is very friendly. Temperature in the women's showers can only be regulated in the individual cubicles. It is best to shower outside of the usual shower times, otherwise you may only have lukewarm water. There is a school and a racetrack nearby, but we didn't find it disturbing. Arrive early, the place fills up quickly."
8284,2545467,5,Robeli,07/01/2023,Spectacular deal. A place to rest with very clean facilities. They behaved with us in a familiar way and it was the first time they had seen us. Recommended 100%. On New Year's Eve they gave us a bottle of champagne. We will return for sure.

What I didn't like was that the price is not for 24 hours like in all the paid areas I've been to (at the time you enter you can stay a whole day), not here, you have to leave it at noon, at 1:00 p.m.: 00. I arrived at 8:00 p.m. with the idea of spending the whole day and it was not like that"

The only downside for me is somewhere in the area around on both the friday and saterday nights was very loud with live music, my partner slept through it but i couldn't get to sleep until like 4am when they stopped. (so bring earplugs if your a light sleeper).

Also google maps had the wrong bus into town. use L7"

The toilet facilities are a bit worn and the area itself is not super exciting. A good place to spend the night if the trip goes to beautiful Cartegena.
8284,1840695,5,squid,20/04/2022,Fantastic! Great area and especially for children. We will surely come back! Thanks for everything Theresa.

The facilities include washing machine, dryer, shower, toilets, washing up sinks, bins. Also a ""sitting room""  & outdoor sitting area. The cubicles in the toilet and showers are small and a little old but kept clean. The bus is handy and runs every 15 minutes."

Bus number 7 to Cartagena € 1.20 the ticket. If you come back at night, it is better to bring a flashlight and be careful with the road, although it is not much of a piece. I recommend 100%. Very good treatment, they give you a plan and they explain you very well. Perfect if you come alone."

8284,1548114,2,taco654,05/09/2021,"The access does depend on you. Have you requested at least the lighting? Regarding the schedule, they DO NOT adequately inform of the exit before entering to be able to decide to stay or not and that is not right. The thing about the showers and the covid is an excuse, there is no legal rule that says that the showers have to be closed. Leave them open and put up signs with gauges that this is what the law says."
8284,1546872,2,taco654,04/09/2021,"The area has 3 negative aspects; One is the access to the area itself, which is very busy and there is no margin for pedestrians to circulate, there is no lighting because there is no security. The departure time, which is at 1:00 p.m. when it is not warned like that and should be at least 24 hours. and finally that the showers are closed when the reception is not there."

8468,3255905,2,PauloFidalgo,04/09/2023,"We stayed in our motorhome for three months. The staff are very attentive and polite. The prices are adequate, however, unfortunately there were several thefts in the park (wallets, cell phones, tables, kitchen hobs). My wife witnessed the theft of the bathroom cleaner's cell phone. Nothing was done by the administration. Park in decay. Pitiful"

It's just a shame that the pitches are not marked out, it's a little scary at first, very crowded for some who don't respect them."
8468,3205971,5,IanireIanire,23/08/2023,"It's been very good (out of all the ones we've been to, we liked it the most) The bathrooms are very very clean. The pools are spacious."
8468,3175047,5,kholi,18/08/2023,"Without reservation, I recommend coming a little early to queue a bit long, after 1 hour and a half my turn has come, there are 3 large swimming pools, large, spacious, little shade but it's fine, very kind reception."
8468,3166548,5,Aezeiza,17/08/2023,"It's very good, the facilities are very clean, the track is big and enough space for many people. It is 2.5 km from the town, but if you want there is an Uber service and you are in the center in €4. €23.70/night for two adults and van."

8468,3125451,1,Madamaly,11/08/2023,factory!!! to flee directly for those who like quiet places. We turned around after 1 hour of waiting in front to find a place that suited us better.
8468,3114972,5,azaerus,10/08/2023,"We spent 4 nights there, without any worries, sanitary facilities cleaned very regularly. Kind and vigilant staff at night + police rounds throughout the day. There are indeed a lot of people and the 3m limit is not respected. Luckily we found a super quiet and secluded location."
8468,3109130,1,CristelBurgt,09/08/2023,Looks like a refugee camp. What a misery. Tents on top of each other and no place after standing in line for 1.5 hours. Save your time and effort. I wouldn't park my RV here safely
8468,3107304,4,BENHAYOUN,09/08/2023,well located campsite. no delimited location everyone chooses where he stands. clean and spacious bathrooms.
8468,3084618,2,GaizkaVan,05/08/2023,"When checking in, they ask you to leave a distance of 3 meters from one to the other, it's not real. Everyone takes their place in the way they want and can, like in a festival. The facilities are good but if you want peace and quiet it is not the best place."
8468,3083719,4,eugenieSMYRNOFF,05/08/2023,"clean campsite, very clean sanitary facilities. 4 nights in a motorhome for 3 adults and 1 child €163. there is a swimming pool, evenings at the bar every evening, little noisy obligatory silence from 00:00 to 7:00. to move to albuferia, to the beach or to the marina, provide bicycles. there are buses 1.90 the bus per person we took the taxi several times which was cheaper for us."
8468,3026872,4,eliant97,27/07/2023,"A good campsite with excellent toilets and facilities. However, a lot of time is lost checking in and finding a pitch because it's a bit chaotic"
8468,3018129,4,Mark1982,25/07/2023,"stood here for 2 nights. compared to the other places we have had in Portugal, this one was very good. plumbing super good and is always cleaned. nice pool. place shade. and quickly in Albufeira with an uber. Top."
8468,3014403,4,carlaleone05,24/07/2023,"Really great campsite! The sanitary facilities are extremely clean and the swimming pool is a real asset! I highly recommend if you want to visit Albufeira. Personally, we traveled by uber to go to the center (~6€). The price is a little high but remains acceptable given the services offered (bar, supermarket, swimming pool)."
8468,3010595,1,Philippe35131,24/07/2023,"If you are looking for a quiet place, you won't find it here."
8468,3002797,4,sdeis,22/07/2023,"Compared to other camps we stayed at in Portugal, this one was the cleanest. The toilets even flush paper, showers are clean. The kids playground is also nice. It is however quite crowded. There are no designated pitches but rather free for all. They tell you just to stay 3m apart. There is some music form the bar up until midnight."
8468,2965304,2,worml,15/07/2023,"Very noisy campsite at night, clean sanitary facilities compared to some campsites in the Algarve, however restaurant non-existent in July? For pitches it's a bit like you want as long as you are more than 3 meters from your neighbor."
8468,2918100,2,sandra_03,03/07/2023,"The campsite is huge! Free choice of seats, which actually sounds great, but when we arrived all flat seats with a bit of shade were already occupied. The pool area is large but neglected. The pool is not clean, some of the sun loungers are broken. The toilets are pretty clean, but the lights don't work in many places and you shower more or less in the dark. The location is good."
8468,2914698,1,medusacurse,02/07/2023,"amenities here are good, but the service it self and reception not good for me, is like a free for all parking no lines people using to much of place ..."
8468,2914083,5,melanieperez,02/07/2023,"Great campsite we stayed 2 nights. Very clean. Free placement. Depending on where you sit, it is possible to hear the road a little but not disturbing. Large and well-appointed swimming pool. Very friendly staff who ensure tranquility even late at night. Bike path that allows you to go to town and the beach but not always very well indicated."
8468,2902983,1,AllyGalves,28/06/2023,"What a pity! Actually, the campsite is very nice, BUT the crime rate at this campsite is very high and thefts are the order of the day. Unfortunately, we are not the first victims, but according to the permanent campers, this has probably been the case for years and the campsite operators are not doing anything."
8468,2902668,1,don_quijote,28/06/2023,Unfortunately we were turned away with a small campervan. Only for tents and mobile homes.
8468,2881644,4,GBMontagne,22/06/2023,"Nice campsite with lots of shade. Services and swimming pool at the top. Accepts dogs, a lot of free space (June 22) according to the staff, it gets more complicated in July… English or French reception depending on the person, very friendly. So yes there is a ""hiccup"" free places, you choose your place depending on the availability... we like it or we don't like it. RAS cleanliness."
8468,2864516,5,jocegege02,17/06/2023,Pleasant campsite with a very nice swimming pool. Spacious pitches Well-stocked supermarket. Heartwarming welcome. Very clean toilets. I recommend
8468,2847077,3,Lucianogonzalez,12/06/2023,"Friendliness of the reception staff. I take away two stars for not giving us food at 2:10 p.m., when at reception they told us that it was until 3:00 p.m. and, in the restaurant, they also had announced the opening of the kitchen until 3:00 p.m. Nevertheless I recommend it."
8468,2837589,2,wildehilde1994,09/06/2023,"5.80 Euro all incl. price for empty and refill. In my opinion, that is way too much if you just want to dump 10 litres of grey water...
One star for friendly reception."
8468,2832196,5,Elebetti,08/06/2023,Everything you need is there. Reception and security top. Bathroom and showers top. Hot water to wash the dishes. Lot of space between pitches. Swimming pool ok.recommended.
8468,2829593,4,Kazabird1,07/06/2023,"Large commercial site. We managed to bag a large pitch as the long termers left when prices increase 1st June. otherwise free for all pitches under the trees.
Showers were great on arrival but changed during our stay as they installed push buttons.
Very clean facilities, great pool area and well stocked shop.
Nice walk to Albufera. €22 euros for two people and a camper with electric."
8468,2808635,4,Vanity90,01/06/2023,"A nice campsite. The sanitary facilities are clean and large, and new doors are being made. The pool big and clean. The best playground so far, big, lots of play options and sand. We have 17 euros for a Bulli and 2 children with electricity and ADAC. The only downside is that it took 30 minutes to register. Highly recommended, would have loved to have stayed longer."
8468,2802831,4,Noemietjulien,30/05/2023,"Large campsite close to the city (about 10 minutes by bike) with a beautiful swimming pool, good food in the restaurant, smiling and welcoming staff, very clean sanitary facilities (shower, toilets), large supermarket. The only negative point: no demarcation. We arrived and there were a lot of people parked haphazardly sometimes taking 2 places, it's a bit of a shame."
8468,2781519,4,FamZeybek,24/05/2023,"Positive: Clean sanitary facilities, pool and shop top, reception and staff very friendly, nice playground Negative: Plots are not marked, everyone can stand where they want"
8468,2780210,5,apr8778,23/05/2023,"Lovely place, showers and other facilities were spot on, great value too at about 15 euros. Don’t get the pizza from the local pizza shop, it’s terrible.  Also, be on the lookout for the hen."
8468,2776332,5,letsgo21,22/05/2023,"Very pleasantly surprised after a 3 week stay. We were a bit scared as the price is a bit on the low side. But everything is provided. Spacious pools and plots. Okay, it may not all be finished to perfection or clean, but there must be a difference somewhere. More campsites should be run this way. As a customer you have a lot of freedom in choosing a place and how you stand. The condition is to give each camper space and be at least 3 meters apart. Staff is very friendly and does their best to keep everything in order. Control to enter the campsite is strict and gives a good and safe feeling. Supermarket is a bit on the expensive side because only branded products are used here. The only drawback is the catering establishments on the campsite. We are therefore outside the high season and then almost nothing is open. But 50 meters outside the campsite is a cozy bar on the paddel fields. After about 10 campsites from Northern Spain to here in Albufeira, this one is number 1. In short, I absolutely recommend this campsite!"
8468,2763347,5,TomasainoS,19/05/2023,"5/16/2023 we spent the night here, very quiet, clean. The reception was very nice, we arrived at approximately 10:00 p.m. and they took great care of us. dogs free. €13.80 a night for two people in a small motorhome with no electricity. We would return without thinking."
8468,2756389,3,joq31,17/05/2023,Campsite near Albufeira. The reception is cold and very robotic! The pitch is free and the toilets are ok. 22 euros in May. Good to spend a night!
8468,2750357,5,Den_Twan,14/05/2023,"Super campsite, there is a bit of a relaxed atmosphere. Place freely to choose as long as you respect the 3m rule. Proper sanitiar (bravo to the cleaning team) Depending on the place you can hear the highway but did not bother us. Every employee at the campsite was very friendly and helpful. Place in the shade, nice swimming pool everything top We stayed here for 12 days definitely recommend this campsite"
8468,2742627,3,Kristin11,11/05/2023,"Unfortunately very loud, still extremely loud music at 11pm. People walk right by the RV even when you're sitting and eating."
8468,2741266,3,frigoule7183,11/05/2023,"Beautiful and large campsite, beautiful swimming pool and good amenities. Complicated to find your place because it is not allocated and noise from the road. It's a bit factory"
8468,2740814,5,threeasabird,11/05/2023,"Stayed here for 10 nights and it was great, really nice services, pitches in the shade and really easy to access the different areas of Albufeira. Definitely recommend"
8468,2733933,5,BeaKoopman,08/05/2023,"Great campsite. Nice swimming pool, neat sanitary facilities, fairly free places. Unfortunately, the restaurant was not open on Sunday, maybe high season? Tip: From the campsite, take the bus to Albufeira (Bus 3), which does NOT go back, but then take a taxi from Av. Liberdade (where you got off) which is just as expensive."
8468,2726470,5,BoxerRanch,05/05/2023,"Generous plots, enough trees. Nice sanitary facilities. We were there for two days and we really enjoyed it."
8468,2701934,4,jlacacho,27/04/2023,Nothing to add to the previous comments except that the plots could be taken care of a little more. But ATTENTION with the bus: it only takes you from the campsite to the center. To return they took us to the bus station and there they forced us to pay another ticket (€1.90) if we wanted to get to the campsite. I have brought it to the attention of the campsite so that they can notify us. No comment
8468,2696810,5,mumu971,25/04/2023,"Top services, impeccable sanitary facilities with toilet paper! except closed restaurant and a little noise from the road. Albufeira not very practical by bike!"
8468,2690693,5,SB,23/04/2023,"Clean campsite, with space. Shims are needed for the level of the cc, depending on the places. It's sporty to come back from the center by bike but it's doable. We stayed there for two nights."

8468,2671663,5,N444NNW,15/04/2023,"Can’t fault it. There is plenty of space , at the moment. I think it will become very busy in high season. Ammeneties are brilliant as are the staff. The restaurant and bar on site are really good . Security is tight so it feels so safe here. Windows open .  It’s a 30 min walk to Old town"
8468,2668975,5,VitorRodrigues,14/04/2023,"Park with quality very good prices, friendly reception. A 5-minute drive from several supermarkets. A 15-minute drive away are several less frequented beaches. The best park to date in Portugal for PRICE **** QUALITY Bathrooms with paper and always clean. Hot water for washing dishes."

8468,2618112,3,Carich,21/03/2023,We stayed one night.  Many long term clients and pitches not dilineated so not easy to find a suitable space.  Friendly staff and clean facilities.
8468,2583926,3,CharlotteRob,19/02/2023,"We stayed for one night in early Feb while passing Albufeira and it was fine but had a bit of a strange vibe. There weren't many pitches free to choose from and a lot of them appear to be used by people who live there, with some looking pretty run down.

Facilities were okay so no complains there."
8468,2580844,4,mogette,17/02/2023,"A pleasant campsite where you have to find your place, which is not easy. Exemplary cleanliness of the toilets. This is the third time we have come here."
8468,2567540,5,tehonu,03/02/2023,No defined plots so you have to juggle even in February when you don't expect to be tight against each other. Otherwise good value for money especially in Albufeira!

8468,2559820,4,julia312,24/01/2023,"Very nice reception, we liked the place. Sanitary facilities are not new but very well maintained and are cleaned several times a day. Unfortunately WiFi didn't really work. There are no fixed plots, you can stand where you want, should only keep a distance of 3 m. Now in the low season no problem, in the high season certainly very confusing. €11.80 2 people without electricity."

8468,2548766,4,yang082288,11/01/2023,The best hot shower I’ve had in all of Portugal. No joke. We drove in from the north and are all the way down here now and we’ve had one disappointing shower after another &i almost cried yesterday when that hot water almost burned my skin (happily). 10/10 for shower. The parking situation is a hot mess. No structure. Chaos.

The Christmas dinner in the restaurant is definitely not recommended. Dishes half warm and many ready-made products or a very bad cook. Overall way too expensive for what you get, no recommendation for that restaurant. Camping is highly recommended and we will definitely come back!"
8468,2532222,5,Gezeitenstrom,29/12/2022,"the place is super super clean. Many thanks to the cleaning ladies who always do their best. In addition, a pool area, restaurant terraces... everything was there. Place firmly in German and English hands. Place very touristy and overpriced, but that's not the fault of the campsite. You inevitably get to know the customs and customs of our European islanders. Warm and kind."

8468,2432125,5,diggiparkingonly,09/10/2022,Best campsite we’ve visited so far. Plenty of space in low season. For approx 11 euros for van plus 2 adults it’s very cheap and includes free use of the pool. Supermarket and restaurants on site.
8468,2432120,5,MarcStrobel,08/10/2022,Well maintained campsite & nothing to complain about! 11€ for 2 people and a van. Free choice of seats and large supermarket :) Gladly again!
8468,2431513,4,lebeausergio,08/10/2022,"Nothing to complain about. Pitches not delimited, very large campsite. Very clean and well-maintained toilets not far from the city and the beaches"
8468,2428685,5,Barilozza,07/10/2022,"Huge site with loads of spaces (at least in October). True that some of the guests take up bigger spaces making it probably chaotic during peak season. Facilities well kept (plenty of showers and toilets) regularly cleaned. We stayed 2 nights (campervan, 2ppl, no electricity for 11.80€ per night) so money/value is 10/10."
8468,2413143,3,JohnSteele,30/09/2022,"Facilities are good. The camping area not so good. Small plots, park where you want, plots are uneaven and dusty. Would not accept our ACSI card in reception although ACSI registered also quite a long wait to book in. Good value for money €11.80 per night, no electric. 1.5 miles walk to the beach."
8468,2412090,4,DaniBoi13,29/09/2022,"Fantastic camping, large and spacious. Great facilities & plenty of hot water (with pressure) at the showers. A mini market that’s decently stocked! Good location to the centre."
8468,2404797,5,IdaSchill,26/09/2022,Very nice campsite for cheap price. With pool and supermarket and clean sanitary facilities.
8468,2398032,5,ahsturm,23/09/2022,"Not near the beach, but the rest is perfect: extremely clean sanitary facilities (cleaned several times a day), above all, enough stations for the pitch, finding a pitch is no problem at all, basically the pitches are defined, even if not numbered, washing machines are great, access The place is permanently monitored, so you feel very safe."
8468,2383966,5,AndreaPostigo,18/09/2022,"On the dates we have been it has been a pleasure. Bathrooms were clean, showers were good. The spacious plots."

but again Katastrophe, 
the Reception unfriendly and you wait 1 houre for check in  :(
very Bad and expansive!!!!
dont go there !!!"
8468,2369145,3,vandreamer55,13/09/2022,They have several swimming pools and are adapted for reduced mobility. Fairly new children's park. The worst thing is that it does not have the plots defined. I don't want to imagine in August. The road closes according to the plots.
8468,2366226,4,khris1166,12/09/2022,"The campsite is very well guarded, it is the best, the rest is fatal, little shade, a lot of noise on Saturday night, terrible food, very clean services, the cafeteria is good and the supermarket is very good, the pool is large and good.."
8468,2360700,3,MBORREGS,11/09/2022,"It's fine for a couple of nights at this time, in the middle of August it has to be horrible. It's a bit dirty and uncontrolled, you camp wherever you like, there are tents and caravans that look like they're abandoned... Good for one night and use services but I wouldn't stay more days and less in the middle of summer."
8468,2353331,4,gmkiki,08/09/2022,big and beautiful campsite but as in most campsites in Portugal the pitches are free so it's a hassle to find the right place. large and clean sanitary facilities. think of the bike to go to town by the cycle path. the reception was very friendly and courteous. we were only there for one night so impossible to judge the rest of the services but we recommend this place.
8468,2341435,5,AnaBanana,05/09/2022,"In September, no problem of queuing or places available even when arriving at 8:30 p.m. We paid 16.80 euros for two in a van. Impeccable toilets. It's a big campsite, entertainment, music etc... It's not really our thing but not too much choice in the area and frankly it didn't bother us too much."
8468,2328948,4,VhCt,01/09/2022,"very nice campsite! One star deduction because of the parking space search, because everyone parks the way they want. The pool is great, you can do laundry, shop, spa. The check in worked great, within 10 minutes. we would come back anytime."
8468,2304584,5,AmbraB,26/08/2022,"very large campsite perfect for families and children. very nice and cared for. Huge and perfect services, showers in the heated room. Fabulous pool with entertainment all day, if the music bothers you, look for a place away from the pool. market provided. there is a restaurant and a pizzeria inside. a bit far from the center you need a means to go there. the only flaw there are no pitches."
8468,2285197,4,tinachan,22/08/2022,"There are a lot of people, you have to wait approximately 2 hours going at 9am. When you enter there are no places, you have to look for them like crazy. But once found the site, the campsite offers all the services, very clean, of 10. Large and spacious pool, and the restaurant and bar open at night with entertainment. Totally recommended to spend more than one night. 21 euros van 2 adults / night"
8468,2264877,1,McDreamy2022,19/08/2022,"Was full, everyone got sent away. We arrived at 14:00. Would be better if it’s visible on the website if they still have slots open or not. So we don’t drive for nothing to the camp site."
8468,2252112,4,Monmarq,16/08/2022,"A place totally overwhelmed by the massive influx of campers. We were going for 5 days and we stayed 3 hours. They make us check without a place. Camp where you can. Yes, friendly staff."
8468,2250554,2,furwood,16/08/2022,"We don't know what it's like inside because it's almost impossible to get in, we arrived at 8:30 in the morning and the queue to catch the night went around the reception, we held on for ten minutes and seeing that it didn't move, we left."
8468,2211131,3,stela9,10/08/2022,"overbooked campsite. You have to manage to find an area to locate yourself. You have to queue for everything (washbasins, showers, buy bread, even to go out...) the toilets and showers leave much to be desired, as in all campsites in Portugal. €21 1 van 2 adults"
8468,2188788,3,Rafikis,07/08/2022,"I don't really know how to define this campsite: really the system for choosing a plot is war (lucky!), and once inside, it's a strange mix between travelers and landlords. Even so, very friendly reception (although always full), very clean bathrooms for the amount of movement they endure and a spectacular pool (although saturated). Free dogs. Taxi to Albufeira €5. Ok as a passing campsite"
8468,2177664,1,daniel4747,05/08/2022,"We left the campsite days ahead of schedule, they don't have capacity control and they keep putting people in even when it's full, desperate people invade your space, a large number of people have a very, very large space! The so-called longtenders, I would NEVER go back!!!!!! Lack of education of the longtenders themselves who believe they are the owners of the campsite, I don't give it -10 stars because I can't!"
8468,2174992,1,ManuelLebrija,04/08/2022,I give him one because he can't put any after calling all day they don't pick up we went there and it was very full and we decided to stay but after an hour waiting for the check we decided to leave you can't have so many people waiting so long and like I went to other campsites and it was a success to go and visit the Lagoao campsite 100% recommended
8468,2159557,1,MiniCamperBE,02/08/2022,"In my case, I would actually give no stars. I drove from Germany to Porto and down to Albufeira with my Mini Camper (Combi) and have only had good experiences, but here I was greeted very rudely and condescendingly. Sleeping in a mini camper is NOT allowed here and I had to sleep in a tent, of course it costs extra. Very disappointing :( :("
8468,2138775,3,lebonro,29/07/2022,"Camping without more pitches are poorly delimited, it is quite complicated to settle down without knowing if you are going to interfere or encroach on the installation of your neighbor. 30 minutes walk from the city which is magnificent and which is really worth the visit by against the bus never passed we took an uber round trip. Swimming pool very crowded and not very clean cloudy water"
8468,2118958,4,CarinaDolezich,24/07/2022,"Nice big campsite with bar, restaurant, pool etc. Sanitary facilities good. Not really quiet at night but that's because of the people and not the site itself. Plenty of shade options. One person, car, tent & dog per night €22."
8468,2113494,1,zolivermp63,23/07/2022,"Huge campsite with non-delimited pitches, full sun, next to a national road so very noisy, dirty swimming pool, distant beach."
8468,2109215,5,park4portugal22,23/07/2022,Came here by accident. Check-in takes a long time but in the end it is worth it because the campsite is great. Good pool. Our kids love it here. Clean sanitary facilities and lots to do. Extended our stay and ended up staying 4 nights.
8468,2093416,4,chelina237,19/07/2022,Were there for 2 nights and were satisfied! We can really recommend this place! Price-performance ok & clean sanitary facilities! Point deduction due to confusing choice of seats and long waiting time at check-in! Walk to the sea & town (very busy) about 20 minutes :)
8468,2091148,2,FredericLagarde,18/07/2022,"huge campsite at the excessive price of €21.60 for two without electricity. No delimited location, far from the center and the beach. Very long registration, creation of card for each person. Clean toilets."
8468,2075841,4,karolienenjuul,15/07/2022,Very large campsite where many people with children stay. The campsite offers an activity every day such as Zumba fitness and karaoke. It looks a bit like a large family hotel. The check-in takes a long time. You will receive a personalized card with your photo on it as proof. We thought this was a bit too far-reaching. Plumbing is okay.
8468,2074888,5,CNS33,15/07/2022,Large campsite so many people pitch to choose clean sanitary facilities and small grocery store with the essentials
8468,2051680,5,Haui,08/07/2022,The camping site is very large and you can choose the site yourself. Sanitary always clean. Shop a bit small but has the essentials (and those really tasty donuts). Have been here many times and satisfied every time!
8468,2048514,5,carolina1331,08/07/2022,"Great structure, the best overall Algarve. I am sad to have discovered it only at last day… make sense base camping here and go visiting beaches"
8468,2043046,1,DavidEscanero,06/07/2022,"Old but clean toilets (should not be a credit). The poorly defined plots and a lot of land, something understandable for the area, but they have charged me for a motorcycle, I explained to them that it is my assistant, like the one who carries bicycles, I am not a motorcycle traveler, we go on a 7m AC, a mini motorcycle that goes inside the trunk, should not be an extra to pay. Reception, unfriendly typical of a megacamping"
8468,2040723,1,kathiiieee,05/07/2022,"We were received very unfriendly and snotty. In order to be able to look at the pitches at all, we had to deposit our ID. We drove again!"

8468,2015925,4,MartaJaner,27/06/2022,"Quiet campsite. Clean facilities and with 3 swimming pools in the same enclosure. In our case, we did 1 day there to be calm with the motorhome, enjoy the pools, use the showers and continue our route. The only but that I would put, is that it is far from the center and the beach... you have to take a bus."

The facility, including the sanitary facilities, is clean and large. We were here for two days and made a trip to the small and very beautiful city. There are many shops and nice restaurants right by the sea (about a 20-minute walk)."
8468,1928025,5,mcFlyby,29/05/2022,Stayed here for a month and spent two weeks on my own. It was ideal everything I needed all on the site. Pool that was more like something at a big hotel. Bar restaurant. Entertainment. Washing facilities. Brilliant location a cycle or walk into the old town. Couldn’t fault at all
8468,1919398,3,Viktoria30,26/05/2022,"The gentleman at reception was quite stressed. The sanitary facilities were clean, the pool was a bit neglected. In our opinion, the plots are not optimally divided with the plants, but the place was clean and well-kept. On the whole, however, the stay was pleasant."
8468,1901497,5,joke64,20/05/2022,"Large campsite with spacious pitches. At this time of year it is nice and quiet, so we stayed 3 nights. Plumbing looks clean and well maintained.

8468,1880706,4,Hummel1887,10/05/2022,I paid 8€. Alone in the campervan without electricity. A lot is always done to keep the complex beautiful and I felt comfortable. It's more of a family camp with a well-stocked mini market... Albufeira and the beach are within easy walking distance

8468,766744,4,esojcamper,09/01/2020,"I came to this park after trying the service area near Falesia Beach, which was full. It is a large park, mainly occupied by Britons, who spend the winter here (the service area was occupied mainly by the French). It is a bit far from the center of Albufeira, but there are buses every 30 minutes. Good toilets, heated. The only problem is the noise of cars on the road."
8468,763791,5,fizzghigg,04/01/2020,"Come for one night, stayed 3! Free location, so it can be a bit of anarchy. The 2nd night, we chose the camping space closer to the road (which did not bother us) and there were much less people, brand new and clean toilets. The price went up during our stay ... but that's because we changed the year. So 13 € 50 for 2, a van, a dog (free), and electricity."
8468,760375,3,Staceo,30/12/2019,"Awful check in process, made worse by having to walk around the campsite to pick a spot with a crap map that didn’t have any detail. And told most of the park was reserved. It’s busy this time of year but they would get in a lot more customers if they marked the spots and didn’t let people hang washing lines to block spots! That being said the facilities were great, showers and toilets very clean and hot. Walk into town easy on the marked walkway"
8468,743879,1,Lisafrdmn,16/11/2019,"Can not recommend the place, we were with our dismantled MiniVan (Peugeot 807) forwarded without explanation. For one night we should not have stayed longer. In addition, the woman at the front desk was pretty rude and cocky"

Good washing facilities. Recommenced"

Yes a refection would be useful, but that does not prevent bathing. A bar, a pizzeria, a brasserie, a restaurant, a mini market. Animations the we but midnight ended. 2 adults, 1cc of 7,30m € 10.50 without electricity. Very very correct."
8468,708623,3,Bfoxie,29/09/2019,"Home not very nice, shame! Sanitary clean with toilets and well separated showers which is still a plus. Swimming pools a little old around which there are no umbrellas.Price very correct for 3 nights 41.5 euros for a motorhome of 7 m, 2 people. Choice of location. That said if you want a quiet place in the evening, avoid the edge of the pool because karaoke-style evenings end late and the laughter happily exceed midnight."

8468,658802,1,elvis81,25/08/2019,"Terrible, 1 star just because they agreed to pay us the 2nd night, 1 night was enough. An endless waiting, the location you are doing for electricity is if you find a free outlet and sanitary VERY SALES. To avoid if possible"

We were not greeted, we did not plan ... c very expensive the 4 stars are not deserved.Train not possible to plant a tent. They accept income and do not even know if we can put because does not ask the length of Cc. Pool dirty because people do not remove their shoes before entering and we even saw a man who went into the pool with his underpants and his cropped pants. Frankly French camping is 100 times better. I prefer the areas, at least we get what we pay for. Good road to all. Bise DL"
8468,621111,1,campingcarleng,12/08/2019,"We wanted to ask ourselves but disappointed the price is expensive not to be placed. We manage to find a location with our 7m40 and our note ... in the end we are riding on a path to be with our friends, the laundry is 5 € the chip, c expensive to wait for a machine free. In short, disappointed. Good road to all. Bise DL"
8468,597064,1,Ricardo72,04/08/2019,In summer it is necessary to forget! It is a large lot with unrestricted free location. We are one over the other in anarchy. The pool is crowded impossible to move. I came after the previous positive comments (out of season?) A real disappointment!

8468,576539,4,Gijon,26/07/2019,"Very large campsite, which means that there are always free pit spaces in the middle of the summer where the campground hangs a lot of campsites, spacious plots and very clean bathrooms. the only downside is the distance to Albufeira that forces to have alternative means of displacement"
8468,563264,4,Josy123,19/07/2019,"A great camping! Attention very good, comfortable plots and many with good shade, bathrooms very complete and clean! The restaurant is until 11pm and the food was very rich. It goes by weight, so it comes out very well priced. Highly recommended!"

8468,516339,4,Clem27,15/06/2019,"Camping ok. € 17.45 for one night, two people, van and electricity. Home cold but the rest was fine. Not too crowded in mid-season so no problem to find a place."

8468,510060,2,Marry109,10/06/2019,"The campsite is located just outside Albufeira. The staff is not overly friendly and motivated, but ok. In the lower area there were many dogs from small to large. Nevertheless, we did not have the impression with our dog to be welcome. Actually, we generally did not have the impression that guests are not welcome to the sworn Dauercampergemeinschaft belong. The sanitary facilities were clean and there was toilet paper available. On the whole, the complex made no overly neat impression. We will definitely not come back."

Rare enough to be reported especially at € 15 for a 7.5m vehicle with trailer and motorcycle, electricity and 2 adults. Some will regret a welcome a little cool but in an understandable French. Attendance mainly English, Dutch and German. We will definitely stay there again."
8468,426792,1,WoMoIsa,05/02/2019,"Were rejected unfriendly at the front desk. Overnight in the car is not allowed, only campers and caravans. When we asked why, it just said that these are the rules of the place and we should go. Have never experienced something like this before. Rude and opaque. Really not recommended!"

8468,417954,2,A10S,30/12/2018,"Not the best place we have ever stayed. There are teenagers flying around on motorbikes past the children’s play area. Most of the things in the play area are broken and it can be loud with people outside talking and shouting at night, sometimes until 2am. The woman on reception has a very poor attitude and makes a lot of mistakes. There is often a long line of people waiting to book in, fix things and complain but only ever one woman on the desk. Maybe this is the reason for her bad attitude and many mistakes. The showers are mostly cold although there are a few moments of hot water. The WiFi is not very good and people use the three pools to clean there trainers ! This place clearly makes a lot of money but does not invest much of it back into the campsite. Such a shame"
8468,417856,3,toniperello,30/12/2018,"We arrived in the evening at 10pm, the very kind security man made us a card to pass, the facilities are fine, but in the morning reception ...

I recommend for the facilities but for the service no."
8468,410576,3,papouK,28/11/2018,"Large campsite with out of season many possibilities of home of motorhomes. Right prices and full service offer (mini market, catering etc., see previous comments) not all shaded pitches are stabilized and the risk of bogging in rainy weather requires careful examination before parking (traces of deep leftovers) by the previous occupants ...). The electrical terminals are also activated randomly and it will have taken all my reserve of cables to connect me. On the other hand absolute calm at night, and very professional reception at the reception."
8468,388223,5,morgane31,05/10/2018,"Great campsite, we paid € 12.75 a night for two with a van and electricity in early October.

Quiet, swimming pool, toilets are very clean, water everywhere and a supermarket .. Everything is perfect except the radio permanently at the pool bar which is painful at a certain time .. Anyway c is a good place to refuel, out of seasons at least because it is still very big and in seasons it must not be the same story .."

8468,325238,2,PaloisFB,10/08/2018,I do not like. Loose parcels. Everyone one on the other. No optimization of the space. Sanitary overloaded. There are certainly some people but with a minimum of organization we could put about double without getting bothered. Home: ticket to register and ticket for information. In the end never count less than 30 minutes waiting. May be out of season. But in season there is much better in Spain (and maybe in the Algarve ??)
8468,315306,2,hanna0,05/08/2018,"We did not like anything. Plots without delimiting, you arrive and you plant where you want. Very dry land. Beware of low branches! The entertainment on the night we were, very bad. The area to empty very dirty water."

Price in July 2018: 2 adults go (without electricity) = € 18.60. Rustic camping ground, not on plots. One thing that we did not like was the music of the pool very strong, you can hear almost all the camping and if you want to be quiet around the pool is impossible."
8468,297035,4,flo.odie,22/07/2018,"The price is correct in high season, 30 E (3 adults including child + 10 years, and 1 child + electricity). It is pretty well maintained. There is a bus stop near the campsite entrance and a bike path to access the center. On the other hand, the pitches are not delimited, and the campers put themselves any way, at the risk of disturbing you."
8468,295877,5,caseyabroad,21/07/2018,"Good prices, we paid €24 for three adults in a campervan and no electric. The pool party on Friday afternoon gave it a very fun vibe. Large camping spots and the facilities were nice and clean. Reception were friendly and helpful"
8468,289829,1,Nat64,15/07/2018,"I strongly recommend this campsite 4 stars. Although a reasonable price, the pitches are not demarcated, big no matter what. Deep music, it screams and speaks loudly. No warm water just lukewarm. No respect. Pass your route"

8468,267257,3,Mitsou,12/06/2018,Indeed you have to pay when you arrive. Reception staff worthy of the funeral home! Acsi is displayed at the entrance. But no reduction applied. However the location is nicer than the motorhome area where all motorhomes are crammed. We must therefore ignore these black spots.

8468,226637,2,hymidriver,09/03/2018,"We spent more than eight days on this campsite in late January early February. Unfortunately my assessments differ widely on the positive points of some campers. Indeed, I do not know where is this sanitary block of last generation? Ours was rather dated and very moderately clean. When we arrived we had to pay the entire stay before we could even choose a location. By going to the plots indicated at the reception, I scratched the camper on both sides because of the trees that were not cut, nor in height and width? On the other hand we were lodged just in front of a busy road where not far from a dozen ambulances per day and night, all screaming sirens. Positive point very pretty city, clean, beautiful beaches, abundant shops. Do not miss the good organic oranges of the old lady roadside not far from the campsite. A real treat."
8468,224056,3,baloo589,22/02/2018,"We arrived yesterday and chose after the comments. So very wooded no delimited location so we put where there is room. And the end of February, it's almost full! When sanitary, they are clean but we saw better, they are a bit old. Easy emptying for a large camper. This is the first campsite where we are asked to pay before seeing the pitches and knowing if we will stay!"

I recommend it without hesitation !"

The beach falls away after a few meters [non-swimmer children!] but had to move on early after a few days because of unbearably loud disco music from the neighboring campsite - sometimes until 4am in the morning. Sleeping was out of the question. Overpaid money was refunded as a gesture of goodwill.
8494,2283294,5,hmmnls,22/08/2022,"Great campsite. Got a pitch spontaneously. The facility is located directly on its own beach. The pitches are gravel pitches, so appropriate fastening material is required. Sanitary facilities are all newly renovated and cleaned regularly. The pool is a bit small, but because of the distance to the sea it's no big deal. There is a small supermarket on site as well as a restaurant/bar with evening programs. You can walk to downtown Planes in about 15 minutes. There you will also find the first shops. It takes about 30-45 minutes to walk to the port to have a drink in the evening. We recommend."

On the beach that I grew up height of 1.8m I think. my VW caravele ran out of antenna because the limiting bar is bent down. It is not straight and neither is the ground."

nice place anyway."
8554,482753,4,jakiala,12/05/2019,They have limited the height in one of the car parks. No more than 1.8 we go that a California does not enter. In the other parking according to the poster do not let camping but out of season no problem .. at least until last night. Ideal place to spend the night. Surfer atmosphere and good bars.
8554,464709,3,gsonic,23/04/2019,"Ground parking next to the beach, busy. If it has rained puddles form. Surfer environment and chiringuito next. We raised the roof during the day and without problems although there are signs that prohibit it, we were not the only ones. Good place to spend the day on a beautiful beach."
8554,448497,4,zugas,03/04/2019,There is height limitation but it was open (being out of season). Many signs of forbidden overnight. We were spending the day not allowed there. The place is very beautiful and quiet.
8554,447086,4,ruterosporelmundo,31/03/2019,Magnificent beach and perfect place to sleep. A lot of surfing.

8554,395776,5,Mashy,19/10/2018,I was here in October quite beach  stunning view of the mountains and fairly decent surf definitely worth a visit.
8554,369583,5,dandelion18,10/09/2018,"We have been perfect. We arrived at 6:00 p.m. and we were able to be on the beach, 20 meters away from the parking lot. The beach is very clean and it is beautiful, it is recommended to see the sunset and the game of the tides. Theoretically you can not stay overnight, there are cartels that say you can not park from 1: 00-7: 00. We stayed to sleep in the camper, along with about 6 other campers (surfers, basically). We had no problem!"

8554,179499,4,tooom,19/08/2017,"Parked one night on 13/08/2017. Filled with vans for the night. Late arrival, difficult night to find a place. Beach very nice but armored early in the morning. Shower on the beach and toilets (from 10am) right next door. The parking in the summer has an agent and it is closed as soon as it is full."

8554,95927,4,gui.rzl,16/08/2016,"For big motorhomes, there are about 6 or 7 places on a small parking lot along the road. Actually, the bottom parking is more for small vehicles. Quiet place, great beach and surf spot. The place is Laga Square."

8637,3251281,5,wyo95,02/09/2023,Good and cheap campsite with several sanitary facilities that are newer and very clean. Lots of children. The pool area is covered and there are also loungers. Washing machine costs €4.50. The beaches are fantastic. I paid €12.50 for the car and roof tent.
8637,3235937,4,taniadssantos,29/08/2023,"The park is very good but the staff at reception leave something to be desired. Not very friendly, they had no idea how busy the park was, they sold us “seats” and the park was super full, we had a lot of time looking for space."
8637,3222636,4,Chrisdub87,26/08/2023,"We spent 3 nights there, very good campsite, very very clean sanitary facilities, only noisy downside because the campers settle in until very late. anarchic location but we always find a place, beautiful swimming pool restaurant bar and mini-market, friendly staff I highly recommend 83.40 for 3 nights for 2 with motorhome and electricity. thank you to the campsite team"
8637,3215458,1,MoWi1957,25/08/2023,Camping is chaos. 5 ladies behind the desk who have no idea how many pitches are available. You have to check in first and then go and see where you want to stand. Then it turns out that there are no places available.  Then you are three quarters of an hour further and you can look for another campsite. And we saw more leave. The ladies get a 10 for their pointless work and attitude of ignorance.
8637,3186716,4,marvin117117,20/08/2023,Nice camping spot; Recommened to arrived more early go get a place (we were there in august)
8637,3167229,3,blugraphy,17/08/2023,"the campsite itself is very clean, good supermarket, everything is well maintenanced. unfortunately the organization/staff tries to use/rent every squaremeter even if there is definitely too less space to respect the distance to other campers. all in all, a clean but not comfortable campsite (in high season)."
8637,3144132,4,Aezeiza,14/08/2023,"The campsite is very good, especially the bathrooms very clean all the time. Close to town and beaches. One van and two adults €22.95/night"

Ok for 1 night but not to our taste. Camping a little crowded. Cars drive fast in the campsite, and very noisy in the evening and at night (probably a nightclub open until 5 am …)"

8637,3108403,5,Montanhya,09/08/2023,"The campsite is phenomenal, it has everything, supermarket, bar, swimming pool and the services are clean and disinfected at all times. It's really nice. You have the beach 10 or 15 minutes away on a quiet walk...a little walk that is nothing because it is all straight. Next year we will repeat for sure! It cost us 24 euros for two people with a large motorhome."
8637,3083819,5,mnkkdrv,05/08/2023,"Great camping, it seems like facilities are being cleaned 24/7, very nice reception and a good supermarket. Quite a lot of ppl are camping in tents, so might become a bit loud at night."
8637,3082351,5,Rachocarro,05/08/2023,"Very well equipped, reservation is not necessary. It is large so it can accommodate many campers but it has bathrooms at various points which are cleaned very regularly. Recommendable."
8637,3077663,1,klItaliener,04/08/2023,"Left again after 20 minutes. They let in one camper after the other and the place was full. Unfortunately there are tents on the camper pitches. Security wanted us to park on a grassy strip by the toilet. I think the problem occurs more often, since you only pay when you check out. About 10 other unsuccessful campers also left with us. Otherwise it looks pretty nice."
8637,3077519,5,tfpaixao,04/08/2023,Great great park it was really good the facilities are great . Great space for caravans . The bathrooms where always clean . The people that work there are great .

Super!"

Adjustable showers but (as in all of Portugal) without toilet paper. AC at 7:30 a.m., two adults and electricity €26 per night. One step away from a town and beach to photograph."
8637,2975501,1,europaknaller,17/07/2023,Facilities are top notch. But what a noise!! Cars drive up and down until 00:00. Children are still shouting and ranting. For those who want a little rest? Don't come here!!! Have spent many nights in the mobile home but this was the worst ever.
8637,2975090,2,wilkescheers,16/07/2023,"Not a top experience for us, we could not agree with the 5 * reviews. Positive: good selection in the store, clean sanitary facilities. Negative: absolutely not a quiet campsite, pitches very close together, non-stop noise all day long from the ball hitting the fence of the basketball court, screaming children, shouting people, loud TVs / music, ... for us it was pure chaos."
8637,2968133,5,jono_heywood,15/07/2023,"Great campsite, all required services. Plenty of space for motorhome sunset the shade of trees. Very well serviced facilities, very clean and the staff are very pleasant and helpful. We only intended on staying one night but ended up there for 2. Would definitely stay here again."
8637,2956847,5,joaocurtinha,13/07/2023,"Park with lots of shadows and very careful. The changing rooms are in excellent condition, with a children's area with a bathtub. Great pool with a covered area suitable for the region where you can get a little wind"
8637,2952615,5,pooknero,12/07/2023,"One of the best campsites visited. Excellent services and above all constant cleaning, always impeccable bathrooms. Zambujera, a delightful village with beautiful beaches (but the sea is ice cream) and beautiful routes on the Rota Vicentina, the one towards the south is better!"

Fully stocked internal supermarket. Slightly sloping but well-marked long motorhome pitches. Very easy loading and unloading. Very kind staff. Beach about 1 kilometer. Recommended for a relaxing break
8637,2913870,4,PitBro,02/07/2023,"Very good campsite, friendly reception, very clean sanitary facilities, small bar and relatively well-stocked supermarket, there are also a few small supermarkets in the village about 1 km away, very nice village with a few restaurants and a very good pizzeria, pizzeria Picolino, beach from the campsite about 1200 m steep downhill to reach"
8637,2902885,5,friseur13,28/06/2023,"Everything is great here. Quiet place, nice staff, nice little places but not too narrow. Everything is well divided and there are also a lot of grills around. You can buy and make the fish directly in the nearby fish market. The small bungalows can be rented quickly for people who are only traveling with a tent and want to stretch out a bit."
8637,2902664,5,RichardMillar,28/06/2023,"We don't have an ACSI card so pay €24 a day, 2 people in a campervan with electricity. Best campsite so far in Portugal. Good value for money.  Good level sites, self chosen, with shade if wanted. BBQ facilities. Clean and well maintained toilets and showers. Agree with previous comments.  Totally recommend."
8637,2901734,5,billym,28/06/2023,"We stayed here for 9 nights in late June at ACSI price of 17 euros.

It was spotlessly clean all the time, had constant hot water for washing up/ clothes washing/ showers.

Many of the pitches were under eucalyptus trees which was much needed in the high temperatures.

Friendly staff, nice bar, well stocked shop, decent pool.

10 minute walk to nice beach, local bars/restaurants.

Excellent."
8637,2901093,5,gazalia,28/06/2023,"Such a great CP- so far the most beautiful here in Portugal. I can only agree with the previous speakers - we stayed here for a total of 6 nights and we enjoyed it very much, great beaches, great pool, cute place and you can also rent a car from the CP. We stood in the back area under eucalyptus trees. This place is an absolute insider tip. :)"
8637,2882470,4,elliotdayment,23/06/2023,"We loved it here for x2 night.  We got takeaway pizza from the restaurant to our van,  which was such a luxury.  Also met the cutest stray cats.  Pool outside area did not look great :/ we avoided this.  The food shop on the campsite was great and stocked really well,  but overpriced. Our stay was about €17 per night for 2 people in June 2023."

8637,2873247,5,Fam.SchmiFa,20/06/2023,"Definitely a recommendation for families with small children and babies, with ACSI great value for money. Playground in good condition and with free sand, baby bath, very clean sanitary facilities that are cleaned several times a day, very friendly staff, reasonable showers and a partially covered pool area. Beach with creek super suitable for small children who the sea is still too 'wild'"
8637,2856013,5,cath61,15/06/2023,"Superb quiet well maintained campsite, very clean sanitary facilities. Wonderful swimming pools, lots of choice in the supermarket. Nothing is missing. Price acsi 17 € unbeatable. The coast is beautiful, pretty villages. To discover absolutely."
8637,2844260,5,nokidding,11/06/2023,"Excellent camp, spotlessly clean facilities, plenty of room at this time of year. With asci card it was €17 electric included, great value. Friendly staff and great services would highly recommend"
8637,2842513,5,jd07,11/06/2023,"It is perfect. The campsite is very nice, the staff is very friendly. The bathrooms are constantly being cleaned so they are always perfect. perhaps the only bad thing is that the Wi-Fi does not reach the most distant plots. recommended 100%"
8637,2830629,4,coporado,07/06/2023,"Good CP with Acsi 17€ unbeatable. only the trees had to be cut, with us a lot on the roof and it wasn't windy. The toilets were constantly cleaned, really very good. The rat traps were a bit irritating though! The place and the beaches are really worth seeing, 1.5 km to the first beach or in the town."
8637,2827513,5,Roland4711,06/06/2023,Very nice place with free choice of parking space. We searched a bit and then found a nice spot. With the bike you are quickly in town and at the sea. We liked it there very much.

8637,2817412,4,junethms,04/06/2023,"Very nice campsite, super clean sanitary facilities, but a bit annoying that there is no toilet paper. Pitches are partly uneven and electricity boxes are a bit rare, but we still felt very comfortable. Big trees everywhere and great staff. We would always come back!"
8637,2807855,3,Niblar,01/06/2023,"We can't really understand the outstanding reviews. Partly very narrow parking spaces, so that you can hardly sit next to the camper. Everything very open and densely packed, no privacy whatsoever. System absolutely ok, everything there that is also available on every other place. We feel comfortable, but find the place only average. Walking distance to town, restaurants and beach."
8637,2795816,5,BiancaVanlife2022,28/05/2023,"Super sanitary! Very clean and with music. Super camping store, the best I've encountered on the road, everything is there and fresh. Sweet camping cat(s) for me makes this a place home when they want/come to cuddle. Walking distance to the beach with beautiful bays and restaurants"
8637,2784896,5,camperdackel,25/05/2023,"A lot has already been said and we agree, great campsite. Very quiet, quite natural and good facilities. You walk about 10-15 minutes to the village of Zambujeira with great beaches and cliffs with good hiking opportunities along the cliffs. There are also good cafes and restaurants."
8637,2783816,5,rage2021,25/05/2023,"A campsite that leaves nothing to be desired! Great places to choose freely with enough super well-kept sanitary facilities! After a long hike, a dip in the saltwater pool was our highlight! Totally attentive and friendly staff and despite the size a very informal character! The most beautiful place we have ever experienced in Portugal!"
8637,2783166,5,ChrissiSchu,24/05/2023,"Nice campsite! Particularly noteworthy are the very clean sanitary facilities and the well-stocked supermarket pool/jacuzzi. Great facility, beautiful beaches and delicious restaurants within walking distance! We liked it very much. Own choice of place"
8637,2780947,4,Kartoffelsuppe,24/05/2023,"Sanitary facilities are clean, good facilities (supermarket, swimming pool, bar, etc). The course is medium in size laid out under eucalyptus trees. When looking for a place it is a bit confusing. Actually a very quiet place, at night the neighbors' dogs were barking loudly, otherwise you only hear the birds. It is about 1 km to the beach and town. So within walking distance."
8637,2778641,4,DanielAnnaLI,23/05/2023,"the cleanest campsite I've visited in Portugal so far. supermarket, restaurant, pool, children's pool, jacuzzi, playground, 3 washhouses, washing machine, WiFi worked well! Value for money! very nice employees. Bring your own toilet paper! a point deduction because the pitches are uneven and the path to the beach is not within walking distance. we would definitely come back."
8637,2768896,5,MxKrll,20/05/2023,"Super nice place with everything you need. Super clean showers and toilets. Supermarket has everything you need. Be a bit careful with the driveways, low curbs risk of touching down. It takes about 15-20 minutes to walk to the beach. You could deduct a star for the fact that you need a very long cable for some places, but there are worse."
8637,2767597,4,BerndHarbrecht,20/05/2023,very nice place everything very clean. One star deduction it is difficult to find a place. if you have found one then the junction box is too far away. but for the money 16 € 2 people with camper and electricity is unbeatable. not to forget the beautiful beach.

8637,2723422,5,ManilaTao,04/05/2023,We’ve been here with our 13m old daughter. The campground has everything you need and more. We stayed for 5 nights and payed 16€/night with ACSI. The town is a beautiful small jewel with a stunning beach. I think if you consider price/value it’s hard to find a better campground in Portugal. Thank you for having us!

As I work with the Internet and they assured me that there would be no problems, I arrived, connected for 3 days and left. It didn't go well for me in particular, although I admit that regardless of what has been said, it is a good place to rest."

For me it is incomprehensible how, for the price in front of the system, you can stand wildly in the landscape for everyone to see free of charge.

No toilet roll, No hand towels or hand dryer - probably biggest criticism.
Pitches at bottom of park are very spacious, amongst trees, so shady / not level.
€16 with camping card. Expensive compared with other parks visited, but worth it.
Pool undercover but unheated.

8637,2246709,5,kika974,16/08/2022,a clean place but a bit pricey. 35€ all inclusive for 3 adults and 1 child. but we took advantage of the beach which is 10 minutes away on foot and the swimming pool. a very nice little break

Most of the areas for Camper are not parceled out and if you arrive late it is difficult to find a good space and sometimes the light point is very far away. There are a few sloping areas. A bit noisy campsite if you are looking for tranquility."

Small but beautiful plots, many with shade but also some with sun, then you can choose as you like. The pools were a nice extra. The only thing we didn't understand was why we had to pay more for the second after 2€. On the second day there will probably be an additional 10%, which we were not informed about beforehand."

Used it for 22 hours but because it was after 03:00 PM I had to pay for 2 nights. Where is the flexibility and thinking not only about money...

Well worth the visit!"
8637,1128917,5,esojcamper,07/01/2021,"A year later, I return to this park, in the middle of a pandemic (third wave). Very few people, which is good, but the campsite deserved to be recognized as one of the best organized in the south of Portugal. Super sanitized toilets, well-organized and maintained outdoor spaces, sufficiently wooded (that smells like eucalyptus!), A grocery store with everything needed and a large fireplace in the bar. For this reason, it is a good winter destination (take advantage of the discounts)."

8637,1094764,3,annekekaandorp,15/10/2020,"It is a large site, with clearly marked pitches. Most are quite small. There are many trees, so a lot of shade. Not necessarily an advantage in October. The staff work adequately but are not particularly friendly. Sanitary facilities are clean. In short: great campsite, not too expensive but nothing special."

8637,1045282,5,Dadcat,13/09/2020,A comfortable campsite with a saltwater swimming pool and top-notch sanitary facilities. Noisy until 24h but after that it stops and the night has been quiet. The best campsite we have visited since arriving in Portugal. It is 500m from the city center which allows you to see a great sunset and go to a restaurant. To advice.

A bit noisy, until midnight, no restaurant, strange in such a big campsite, a bar with fast food. The bad are motorhome people who occupy several pitches and too much space without thinking about others."
8637,969863,1,jago66,16/08/2020,A shame! Crowded people in times of Coronavirus. Trash overflowing from buckets. In motorhome areas there were tents. These people don't set limits.

8637,923012,2,ozge,02/08/2020,"I dont understand how people can rate this place a 5 star! Only good thing was the camp ground which is under the trees and you feel you are in nature. It was very crowded, people park wherever they like and we are in a motorhome, had some scratches here and there due to narrow streets and bad parked cars. Dirty bathrooms, noisy in the evening also quite a lot of dog poop on the ground."
8637,922454,5,camilathevan,02/08/2020,"The best camping site along Costa Vicentina. It is not expensive - 18 euros for a van, two adults, a baby and a dog.

8637,779516,5,dzenga,12/02/2020,"For me the friendliest campsite ever. Brushed everything three times a day. Everything at hand bar shop swimming pool etc. And if your dog is well brought up and on a leash, he can go to the bar. Beware the boss is there boss. That is the cat mascot of the camping lol"

8637,776584,5,esojcamper,05/02/2020,"Today I returned to this park, considered by many to be one of the best in Portugal, and by me too. So I came back. It's because? Because it has the necessary scale, neither large nor small, because it has a very attentive staff and super clean facilities. I am amazed to have little occupation (thankfully), since here in the Algarve, the service areas for motorhomes are completely full."

(10%) We haven't used the showers but they looked clean. Small plots but with privacy. Many areas for barbecues. Supermarket and cafeteria. Indoor pool and jacuzzi (we have not made use and can not assess) Pretty shade. Close to the urban center and its beach. Check out until 3:00 pm but they are somewhat permissive and we were able to leave a little later. It just lacks some more light at night. The camping areas were a bit dark"
8637,750963,5,esojcamper,07/12/2019,"It is also good to write anything in Portuguese. I want to say that I am currently in a very harmonious park, well organized and with good infrastructure A1 km from the beach, in this low season, allows you to enjoy the harmonious sunshine of the Portuguese winter."

From the campsite, possibility to reach the Cabo Sardao by camper or on foot by the coastal path (7 km) where storks nest on the cliffs, to see! Welcome in french."
8637,139671,3,Toucanos,31/05/2017,"Why so many people in this campsite this May 31st while the 4 or 5 campsites that I just ""tested"" not far from here were almost empty although these coasts are all equally beautiful? P4N and his comments are certainly for many; In fact, we leave the stalag style with its barriers, its barbed wire and its entrances narrower than toll roads. This one is a bit special and has been designed differently, the welcome is warm. I admit that I prefer car parks for campers because in these campsites nothing is done for us and yet it should not much but I think that the owners of these campsites do not like us, will take time! in the meantime do not hesitate to stop in this one but make no mistake, it is still a campsite where large motorhomes have a lot of difficulties to move, to find a good location because of the width of paths and locations and where services have been designed by people who have never seen a motorhome up close. It is true that it is necessary to make profitable each cm2 !! Have a nice holiday"

8637,108988,5,Wafr,06/10/2016,"All this Atlantic coast of Portugal is absolutely fabulous and we slept evening after night in wonderful and quiet places. Only here, there is no service area between Porto Covo and Sagres. So we resigned ourselves to go to this campsite. Excellent surprise, well maintained, well equipped and reasonable in price: € 13.5 without electricity, no extra pool or other. To recommend."

8695,3274681,1,olimpox,08/09/2023,"The regulars are horrible, rude, loud and selfish. A disease that is difficult to eradicate, the campsites believe that. They give them benefits but they create their own rules of the game, and road campers are not welcome because you must put up with their impertinences. Do not go here if everything continues like this. The far West of noises, annoyances and non-existent shadows. Pool and gym well give it one star"
