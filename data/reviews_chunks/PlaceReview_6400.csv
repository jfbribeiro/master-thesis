83761,2477793,2,pticlod,01/11/2022,"very beautiful city to visit in the footsteps of Don Quixote. the area is not very clean, and many people in the park. we go further for the night."
83761,2349116,3,boss_hogg,07/09/2022,"parking easy to acces and close to centre. Dapled shade.  However, small green pond just behind hedge that smelled bad. Maybe mosquitos too. Decided to move on. Possibility to park outside cemetery just few hundred meters away ?"
83761,1695909,4,RicardoRapita,22/11/2021,Lovely town. We had a quiet night. Service area clean and in good working order.
83761,1638126,4,1978Canto,11/10/2021,Nice village. Chuli park for the little ones. There were a lot of flies. We stopped just to visit the town. Nearby bars with a lot of people and good food.
83761,1211899,3,Yudoxori,23/05/2021,"Good site, with shade. It is not recommended, at least, for a Saturday night, bottle lads."
83761,1192580,2,rvanvugt,11/05/2021,"I only used this spot as a day parking, it did not invite me to stay overnight. Trees with low hanging branches and construction work at one side don't really invite to stay longer than necessary. Not really suitable for bigger campervans. Cute little town but at my moment of stay everything was closed. Worth a short visit but nothing more."
83761,475424,5,chantal4015,04/05/2019,"Highly recommended site, village park with facilities for children, has a tap for water, a charming town of La Mancha, recommended for family."
83761,420693,2,salolimu,06/01/2019,"The site is very good, but it is a passage area for many people and cars that pass at full speed at night."
83781,3069184,1,FabriceNatacha,03/08/2023,"A place in the middle of nature which could be magnificent but in fact it is a dump, shame!!!! OK"
83781,2796075,1,MonKR16,28/05/2023,It's a secluded place and there are homeless people living nearby. Daily transit area of a school. Better to park next to the football stadium
83781,2442327,1,noe.drap,14/10/2022,"Quiet road until 8 in the morning. It is the road that leads to a school so it was impossible to leave until classes started, a lot of traffic. I guess in summer it will be better. Lots of mosquitoes at night."
83781,2042071,1,ValentinGaulhet,05/07/2022,"To avoid ! Disreputable according to a local we met (the famous man with 2 dogs, who just wanted to release us). In any case, there are large car parks next to the football stadium not far away, you will be much better off there in addition to being closer to the city center"
83781,1362453,2,AlbertoSope,25/07/2021,"Unfortunate to say ""WC the forest"". If we all do that we will soon destroy natural places, filling them with shit and paper. The site is not bad, but with responsibility."
83781,1335510,1,Mehdi1993,18/07/2021,"Attention private property, we were woken up by the owner and his two dogs! To avoid"
83781,404683,1,pozdrozoVanie,04/11/2018,This is not the place from the pictures. We were there but it’s look like quite scary and not safe. We didn’t sleep there.
83781,404101,1,uxtela,04/11/2018,Photos do not match one place. It is an empty path with some advantageous corners.
83781,388643,4,Ounnet85,06/10/2018,"I confirm, it is a small road very little busy. I stayed here for two nights without any problems or noise."
83781,320075,2,Van.Cat66,07/08/2018,"Be careful the photos are misleading. This is a nice place but it is not the parking that can be seen in the photo above. It is a site on the edge of a small road, a lot of waste which ruins everything. I only recommend this place if you can not find anything else that was our case."
83781,280336,5,gaby48,04/07/2018,"Great location for 50 very quiet motorhomes, no problem with the police just under the meadow stage of the A7 motorway"
83790,2697152,1,Natalia77,25/04/2023,"The parking is private for restaurant customers. There is another one free but it is quite dirty and very close to the main road. It is better to go ahead and stop at Murillo de Gállego, which is a few kilometers away."
83790,611183,3,seryncro,08/08/2019,For a bath and stop on the road more than recommended !!
83790,601371,5,seryncro,05/08/2019,"Place attached to the swamp, quiet and very refreshing !!"
83790,380771,4,alexnaval,23/09/2018,A bit noisy for the bikes in the morning because of its proximity to the road but quiet. the bar people very friendly and well priced to eat
83830,3221908,1,stevievanlife,26/08/2023,"Prohibited overnight, the guard puts the license plates. lots of toilet papers and other rubbish here. good views but for that alone it is not worth it to do all the way over the area of the polygon very ugly"
83830,2290236,4,alemodena,23/08/2022,"We stopped for lunch, nice little place and with a nice view. Very calm"
83830,1173857,1,cleobea,15/04/2021,"The site is spectacular, but overnight stays are prohibited. The Civil Guard goes up frequently. The lighthouse is a protected area."
83830,1173856,1,juansisto,15/04/2021,"The Civil Guard came at 00:30 to lay us down, as we have a baby and there is a curfew they let us stay, but in the morning another Civil Guard car appeared, and noted the license plate, I don't know if they have fined us. A while later, a car appeared with two very strange men, one of them smoking, circled the van just half a meter away, took a photo from behind and they left ..."
83830,987574,3,penacas,21/08/2020,"A beautiful place to spend the day, hike along the cliffs and watch the sunset, but not to spend the night. In the middle of the night, the Civil Guard came to ask us to leave because sleeping there is prohibited. And according to what we were told, we have not been the first during these last days who have been told to leave."
83830,977434,3,jaumegil,18/08/2020,"50 meters of potholes to access. very quiet, ideal for walks by the lighthouse of Nieva. Very quiet, 50 meters of potholes to the access, fishermen's parking and watching sunsets. start of good walks."
83830,901965,3,Li7us,26/07/2020,"Good place, you only have to make 50 meters of road with the occasional pothole, accessible for all types of vehicles, although the area has quite a few potholes we have planted ourselves flat. Everything and that, a place of passage for people to watch the sunset."
83830,535983,5,campaholixx,02/07/2019,Great night here ! Awesome for sunset. No problems at all with authority
83830,396221,3,legepa,20/10/2018,"Bad taste, we arrived at night, there were about 8 parked cars, we got in and we were muddied."
83836,3286499,5,iza123iza,11/09/2023,"Luxury for an overnight stay, spectacular sunsets."
83836,3265433,5,hjsi10,06/09/2023,Great overnight stop.  nothing open around us.  no facilities.   lots of dog walkers.   absolute silence overnight except the odd duck.
83836,3226451,3,viajera70,27/08/2023,"Nice place, but the access from the north is a farm road, super narrow and with potholes, like only one lane. We were lucky that we didn't find anyone in front of us, otherwise, bad thing... You have to enter through the road that comes from the south, that is very good."
83836,3119263,4,pabloall,11/08/2023,Quiet and beautiful place. Only the bathroom is missing
83836,2908213,2,wendyketawa,30/06/2023,"Beautiful quiet spot with pine trees and a lake. I dont have a toilet in my van, but always find a way and leave the place clean. Vanlife is going to get banned in Spain too like the Portuguese coast if people keep on treating the environment like this! Because of this I dont share spots anymore"
83836,2764270,5,Orion3,19/05/2023,"Very quiet, shady pitch on the water. Highly recommended. Is dogs and children - friendly. Good access, an open beach bar on site."
83836,2702593,5,lacasadeloscolores,28/04/2023,"Great area to rest after seeing the city of Merida (which is 10min away). During the day there are people fishing or eating, but then you sleep peacefully. We stayed 2 nights and it was great. You have to enter carefully because there are unevenness in the ground, but nothing important."
83836,2657021,5,Kamubi,10/04/2023,Forest area with many places to park and spend the night. There are two beach bars. On weekends it is full of people who are going to spend the day. We spent one night and the truth is that very well.
83836,2588978,5,lostinnaturevan,24/02/2023,great place. peace and quiet at night. sometimes local passenger cars drive up at night. we recommend
83836,2460947,5,minipooss40,24/10/2022,"Very nice spot! Lots of space, trees, rather flat and quiet. Possibility of cycling or walking around the lake."
83836,2453095,5,DjAma64,20/10/2022,Great spot. We were 2 vans and a CC but distant. Very nice place with some rubbish it's a shame. Flat place. We spent a quiet night there.
83836,2438672,5,LydiaNeault,12/10/2022,"Very nice location! Nice view, we found a rather flat place. Several other caravans were installed around us and apart from those who celebrated until 3am (bad luck), it was in no way disturbing. We are very far from each other!"
83836,2406910,4,Mochritzina,27/09/2022,"Very nice and quiet. We still spend an hour in the morning to collect garbage (3 bags). There is a yellow container just after the small bridge, please use it…"
83836,2349582,5,TuioPadilla,07/09/2022,"Highly recommended place to rest and even spend the night. I was at the end of August, a good temperature, with shade and, in general, a calm environment. We spend the night a lot of motorhomes and campers."
83836,2240611,5,RocioRizz,15/08/2022,"We parked around 6pm with no problem and spent the night. Quiet place with trees, good environment with the reservoir. There is a beach bar that closes early and you can barely hear where the vans are. Great for stopping."
83836,2081519,5,lipoca,16/07/2022,"Really good spot with lots of parking places, and shadow (you can park under the trees). There is a nice lake right next to it, a couple of bars. It is not too isolated so it feels really safe. I didn’t find it dirty (as mentioned in previous comments)."
83836,1929363,4,MJM1975,29/05/2022,Quiet and great place to take a bath and have a beer in the beach bar. The road to get there is very narrow. We have not found any car but I don't know how we would do it if you come across one...
83836,1922122,5,JohanRoy,27/05/2022,"Not a place in the middle of nature but still good, with running water and free showers on the banks of a small lake. A few abandoned straw huts to put your camping chairs on the terrace, facing the lake. A few walkers and joggers. Perfect for one night"
83836,1920272,5,antsinboots,27/05/2022,"Perfect! Really great for van life! Shade, sun, lake, chiringuito, quiet, beautiful, clean. You can bathe in the lake. There is a functioning shower next to the restaurant. CAMINO de Santiago (ruta de la plata) passes right next to us. Local police passes by from time to time. The dam is a roman construction, go check it out! Keep it clean!"
83836,1862522,5,vito63,30/04/2022,"great spot, by the lake, absolute calm at night. many fishermen during the day. nice walk around the lake"
83836,1772060,5,SimonUrban,03/03/2022,"Very nice place. We spent a whole week here, walking around the lake every day. We went swimming once (fresh at this time of year) and used the public showers. Luckily the sun was shining, it was around 20 degrees. There is a wonderful variety of birds to watch here. Cows graze in the fields around the lake. We have felt very comfortable here."
83836,1771432,5,moidejean,02/03/2022,"really cool place, nice view, friday saturday and sunday the chiringuito is open from 12-20, and there are showers a 200m south. nice walk too if you have dogs. mine were really happy!"
83836,1486856,4,GORKATXU,20/08/2021,"Good place to eat or sleep, a bit dirty and at night possibility of noisy couples. Also nearby chiringuito for lunch, dinner, etc."
83836,1399943,4,eliasbarper,03/08/2021,"Very good place to spend the night. In this case, showers were not available due to COVID. Quiet place, without noise. Many ants on the ground and mosquitoes (fact to take into account) but due to its location next to the reservoir, the nights are cooler and you sleep well. Race around the 6km reservoir to start the day right."
83836,1392758,5,nmlacera,02/08/2021,"Also in the morning running around the ambalse, 6 km. highly recommended"
83836,1386933,5,Dclair,31/07/2021,"Historical, millenary reservoir, perfect for taking a good bath, resting, relaxing and enjoying nature. The embalse beach has showers, beach bars, restaurants. At the end of the chiringuitos there is an area with pine trees where you can park and OVERNIGHT. We had a great two days without problems. highly recommended (respecting the maximum)."
83836,1232291,5,AS.Dante,02/06/2021,"Very quiet place to sleep, we coincide with two other ACs. There were no mosquitoes, but as a souvenir we have taken a few ants: /"
83836,1178512,4,TenaciousThie,24/04/2021,"We spent a great quiet night here. The landscape is really great! However, we had to stop with our 10m / 6t alcove directly at the entrance, as all other places were inaccessible to us due to the nature of the ground and the trees!"
83836,1161890,4,giulia96,31/03/2021,"Quiet and nice place to spend a night. In many places, the tree branches are too low to pass with an RV, but there are some accessible spots. The terrain is not always flat."
83836,1056143,5,shunzero,18/09/2020,"Great, very good place to spend the night."
83836,718769,4,RamonKTF,11/10/2019,"Recommended to take the day and spend the night, surrounded by pine trees and with the lake of the swamp at 20m"
83836,712931,5,ninajackson,04/10/2019,Highly recommend. Perfect for overnight. Lots of places to park with shade. Only a few walkers coming by. We didn’t find a toilet but cold public showers were a bonus! Restaurant was closed when we went (Thursday) so not crowded
83836,656172,5,theroverlanders,24/08/2019,"Had two very peaceful nights at this location, shaded by pine trees, away from the bars so quiet."
83836,641570,5,AraleNoriMakina,18/08/2019,"Perfect place, many holes where to put the van, a lot of shade from the pines, you can take out table and chairs since the locals use it for picnics, bars nearby, recommended."
83836,628099,5,MaryDor,14/08/2019,Keeping a little further from the bars near the typical bridge there is no nuisance. We can bath. Quiet place.
83836,582304,4,juanjo.mayans9,28/07/2019,Good place to spend the day and night quiet and close to the city of Merida with few services but very nice.
83836,536325,1,patxus,02/07/2019,"The site is good has chiringuitos services and showers. To spend the night or one for dita, but the swamp full of small leeches, plagued."
83836,535003,5,lavianaatope,01/07/2019,"A quiet place to sleep, with bath and shower. recommendable"

83836,404171,5,mattobi,04/11/2018,"Can the 2 comments only confirm. Unfortunately, the weather in November was not so nice. We will be back in the summer."
83836,333501,5,mikel82,14/08/2018,"Grand place, a clear example that you can get your tables, your awning, chairs, sleep there and leave it better than it was, we loved the place and how nice is to spend a day or whatever you want, each one goes to his and we all enjoyed this place, the water great to bathe."
83836,322639,4,alrak13,09/08/2018,"We sleep very quiet in the middle of August, some van and ac mas, there are toilets open all night"
83849,2958711,3,U.Do,13/07/2023,"Until 10:00 a.m. we were able to park our mobile home (6m) here easily. Some vans stayed overnight. Then full of cars. Great walking tour in the morning, nice views, after that the sand was too hot. Do not park on the roadside of the dune, there were parking tickets!"
83849,2559176,4,familieHommes,24/01/2023,"great place to park if you go to the sand dune. Short stopover. when you drive a little further up, you come to a place between the trees. We also stood here for a while, it was also fine to park for a while. All in all, we were found at the 2 places for a total of 2 hours"
83849,1136570,1,LaerkeSkye,11/02/2021,"It is right by the road, which is fairly busy. Forbidden after sunset"
83849,998790,1,rouneros,24/08/2020,Very bad place with little shade where you can eat or get out of the vehicle
83849,297848,2,edwoood,23/07/2018,"It is a natural park in which at 8 o'clock rural agents have come to tell us that it is forbidden to stay overnight, they have taken the registration telling us that if we were to be there again they would fine us. the site very fresh and flat."
83870,3281848,2,Thevanpackers,10/09/2023,It looks like a nice place but it's closed without notice :(
83870,3238419,3,DuDlik,30/08/2023,A lot of flies so annoying

83870,3073618,5,AldoCyril,04/08/2023,"We loved it ! Small, quiet, super well-kept campsite, magnificent view (don't miss the back terrace of the café!), unbeatable value for money! Remember to do your shopping before, there is nothing on site."
83870,3064640,5,BernieBriscoe,02/08/2023,"Beautiful location with access to lake where you can bath or kayak etc..

83870,2750399,5,nice2seeu,14/05/2023,"Gorgeous surroundings, 10' walk to the nearest lake shore. Kind staff. The toilets are basic but new, and we found them extremely clean. Chemical toilet disposal point available at men's restrooms. Greywater drain on the ground of the main (only) path past the bungalows, by the post with a tab for clean water refill. Grassy pitches under trees ( little to no issue for high motorhomes)."

83870,2342232,4,nicelnic123,05/09/2022,"Great view, lots of peace and large pool included in the price. With electricity per night around 22€, 2 people a camper. Plumbing was basically clean, only thing was the spiders and other things on top of the windows and lights, plus the bar is unfortunately closed from September. Otherwise great place, owner speaks enough English. Spontaneously stayed longer :)"
83870,2305769,5,chuckylang,26/08/2022,"Great spot very nicely situated in a tranquil place (no town to walk to mind) , good fair pricing including electric I think was €20 also use of pool and other facilities. We would recommend to others."
83870,2273430,3,moritur,20/08/2022,"Pitches are relatively large, but the sanitary facilities aren't in a good shape, some doors can't be closed and in some cabins there is nothing to hang your clothes. Staff was helpful, but spoke almost no English and was quite stressed, because everyone was also taking orders from the bar/cafe while checking us in."
83870,2218849,4,elobidou,11/08/2022,"Very small campsite with a beautiful swimming pool, clean sanitary facilities, at the foot of the lake but currently little water so we took the van to go 2 km to the festival site with access to the lake for kayaking and swimming. 30€ per night for 2 people, 2 children, 1 van and electricity"

83870,2138283,5,yitakass,28/07/2022,"Beautiful views, mountain, peace, tranquility, wonderful campsite for people who like nature and tranquility. Very economical. Keep in mind that there is only a small store 2km away, bread on the campsite itself. You have to be well supplied. Two steps from the reservoir, it has a swimming pool, lawn in good condition, clean bathrooms. Keep it up."

The enabled area is always full and daytime parking is not allowed, night parking and night parking, on the contrary, do not allow parking during the day. A real mess and a real hassle changing parking during the day."
83892,2104126,3,jasebri,21/07/2022,"We have slept very well and very calmly, but we have also taken care not to disturb, that it was not noticed or that there was someone inside the AC."

The police came by around 2am but didn't bother us as we were in the van sleeping. However, not very reassuring... If you are adventurous and want calm, this is the best spot!"
83958,2968861,4,AislingSatorra,15/07/2023,"Ideal place to sleep, even though it's a bit dirty... we slept two vehicles there and even though there were fishermen and a young man who came later it was very quiet. There is no beach, it is a rocky place where you can go down to the sea through a pool-like stairs, although it is not easy for everyone to access. Very relaxing sunset."
83958,2930765,4,RaulRadio,06/07/2023,"Good place Motorhome 7.50 meters, important slopes but passable Quiet and residential area, without bars or anything at all. Spectacular sunset.

83958,1513147,3,Txavito,25/08/2021,"It is quiet, nice views and you can go down to the water. The problem is that it is an end of the street and you have to leave space to turn the vehicles so there is not much room, for 3/4 campers"
83958,1432411,5,ira79,10/08/2021,It also has a quiet location and has a beautiful view of the sea. A great place to spend a night.

84007,1730558,5,REIKAVERO,09/01/2022,"Parking lot full of RVs, vans so you don't feel alone to sleep. Very clean. A stone's throw from the city with views of the mountains and the sea."
84007,1709402,4,PeachT5,13/12/2021,"4 stars, considerating that its in the adeje area, where its hard to find something quiet. a few cars and passengers pass by, there are no houses. so its dark and relatively relaxed to sleep here if you want to stay on the area"
84007,766998,3,willvy,10/01/2020,"As parking area is not bad. It is located on Helsinki Street, in the upper area. But when we arrived at the site we were alone, and we decided to park in the middle of the street in front of the Jardines del Duque, which is equally quite level. We were parked 3 days knowing different coves and beaches in the area with the motorcycle we took. It was sensational and without problems"

84057,2745890,1,guntherletransporter,13/05/2023,"sleeping in the middle of the village is a bad idea, there are more and more visitors since the access track to Finestras was redone. unless you like to act like freaks ;-) there is a car park to the left of the village, otherwise a few places along the track after the car park."
84057,2658118,5,OlliV,10/04/2023,"a great place with a gigantic view, in the summer also mobile without four-wheel drive, it took me about 1 hour from the driveway, the tour to the village alone is great, for pure 4x4. continue at the parking lot and after about 300 meters there is a small path on the right side with plato the best parking space, with a full view of the canyon"
84057,2631499,5,eternal_matt,31/03/2023,Spent a quiet night here. Only in the morning did other off-roaders pass by. Can only be reached with four-wheel drive.
84057,2611385,5,AlexHeis,16/03/2023,"35 minutes of walking with VW t6. There are parts of the road where you have to be a little careful. With dry terrain and front-wheel drive without problems. For a large volume it would be difficult to get there if it is not a 4x4, the road is narrow and has sharp curves with stones and holes."
84057,2573977,5,martineetlilou,10/02/2023,"Amazing. Natural china wall born from the belly of the earth, with a curious construction erected in its center. a Hermitage no doubt. the place calls for contemplation."
84057,2396643,5,Cecilecharles,23/09/2022,"Small quiet corner at the edge of the village, quite rugged path but we went in 2x4 H2L3."
84057,2227785,5,BIGMAMA69,13/08/2022,"Magnificent spot in the heart of the village, small car park next to it so that the village remains authentic. We arrived in a white Peugeot boxer (see photo), 90 horsepower / 3 tons, there are 5 “difficult” passages after the junction to go to Fet. We took 2 hours on the way there and a big hour on the way back. All this is done with patience and good humor!"
84057,2008192,5,Chrisleda,25/06/2022,"Beautiful place, we stopped after the bridge and ended up walking to the village. The lake is emptying, it is impressive and sad to see the water reservoir dried up in some places. Lots of people for a remote location."
84057,1878076,5,pascapsud,08/05/2022,"an atypical place, an exceptional view on the wall, track with some complicated passages, we rode with a California T6 combi without worries in dry weather, with a little patience the reward is on the way"
84057,1757567,5,wildhumanlife,16/02/2022,"Very good place to spend the night in the parking lot of the abandoned village of Finsetras, provide chocks and sufficient ground clearance to take the track. Is done well with a little patience, about 1 hour of track."
84057,1727951,5,Haroldontheroad,06/01/2022,"Breathtaking landscape! From the San Marcos hermitage, the view of the walls is magnificent. Not easy to reach with a cc but possible in dry weather (we did it). CC Ducato 7.50m but bf goodrich air suspension tires at the rear. The most important thing is good ground clearance and a lot of patience! We took 4 hours to complete the 16 km from the recently rebuilt road."
84057,1562541,5,GioRgio1979,09/09/2021,"I adore this abandoned town, getting there is complicated, you have to go. little by little (you don't need a 4x4, but a tall car does). In the town there is a parking area, and nothing but silence and beautiful views!"
84057,1524297,4,apeudeterreta,28/08/2021,Complicated road although we arrived with a berlingo suffering in some sections. The parking area is quiet and little traveled. The town and the views highly recommended
84057,1429059,5,alex59150,09/08/2021,"A 4x4 is not compulsory, we passed ""easily"" with our l2h1 110 hp traffic. I think 110hp and ground clearance are more important than 4x4 and patience too, you have to go slowly and not be afraid of a few scratches from the brambles. Go there in dry weather, impossible in rainy weather. Last info, the Spaniards are getting into Clio"
84057,1143464,5,suchange1,27/02/2021,"I rate the beauty of this natural wall. It is simply breathtaking. We are traveling with a small MH. Obviously, impossible to reach this place with a normal car. We parked close to the pig farm in the beginning of the dirt road and continued to go with our normal bicycles. Around 1,5h each way. Just stayed the day."
84057,651787,4,krapniknil,22/08/2019,"Presence of a shelter with table and benches. interesting visit of the abandoned village in the 50s. (letter from a former inhabitant at the entrance of the church) but especially beautiful view of the ""wall of China"" and the lake (especially since the Hermitage San Marco) would say the backbone of a giant reptile! access by non-passable road or hiking."
84057,562963,3,chamenigoz,19/07/2019,"Count 45 minutes from the road on a 4x4 road. We went to Kangoo but you have to take your time! We did not sleep, the abandoned village atmosphere is special!"
84057,548145,5,Franac,11/07/2019,"Spectacular place We were very calm. To go down to the water there is a somewhat difficult path, it cost to arrive with the kayak. There is no water (nor in the source of Finestres), nor coverage."
84090,2465520,3,Isabel567,27/10/2022,"Parking to see the city. It is in the center, but we did not stay to sleep. Access is good."
84090,1646748,5,Veropale,16/10/2021,A large parking lot with lots of cars. The setting is not great but for one night it can do it. At night a person knocked into the motorhome. If it hadn't been for this the night would have been quiet ......
84090,394032,3,edgaredgar,15/10/2018,"It is a large car park. There are people on today but a majority of cars. The setting is not idyllic but it does the trick and it's free. 7 minutes by bike from the center of Durango, 18 minutes walk. No service, just a few shops down the block of buildings opposite."
84095,1623590,5,Timmii,03/10/2021,"Top location, perfect for a rest while traveling (not even 4g). GPS coordinates are not correct, drive all the way to the end and you are down at the dam."
84095,573948,5,al.ma,24/07/2019,Perfect place to sleep ... spend the day etc ... in the middle of nature ... it is reached by a track in good condition ... You cannot climb the dam since it is fenced ... but there is a fountain with a pool big where you can bathe. We spent a perfect afternoon and night ... alone ... the spectacular sky ... silence ... and scenery worth seeing. There is no mobile coverage.
84111,3110127,5,andreparrinha,09/08/2023,"We spent one night here and it was very quiet, we only got the space to stay overnight around 10 pm because during the day it is impossible with the amount of cars, space for 2/3 Motorhomes depending on the size. I advise you to stay overnight in a place right in front of a beautiful beach"
84111,2878572,4,aymxdd,21/06/2023,"Very good place to spend the night. Just wait for tourists to go away before parking (we got there at 17:00, it was full, but empty at 22:30). Only 4 stars because there is still people driving near the park spot during the night, but it is bearable and it offers a unique wake up in front of a sandy beach !"

84111,1407886,5,KimperRat,05/08/2021,"A great place, under the shade of the pines. In the evening the parking lot is empty. There is a sandy beach in front surrounded by pine trees. On the next beach there are showers and a beach bar with bathrooms. The only notable incident, at 8.30 in the morning the man from the bar (Julian Cocksucker) started using a gasoline leaf blower that woke us up. See you on road Kimper Team"

In mid-August we had no problems with it being full, so we were able to leave in the middle of the morning without problems."
84140,1224887,5,jaimegpuente,29/05/2021,I have slept in many places in Madrid and my favorite! More in times when the shade of the great pines is appreciated. At the end completely quiet even on a weekend when the parking lot fills up
84140,1191492,5,Virusapitusa,10/05/2021,"Spectacular place to spend the night. Better to arrive in the afternoon when people are leaving. As there are some hiking trails it gets very crowded. At night some shots were heard, otherwise all very well. The routes that exist are recommended. A beautiful forest."
84140,1188885,3,SalvaCastilla,08/05/2021,"I insist on the possibility of being locked in by the huge influx of people on weekends in good weather. I add that between the asphalt of the road and the land of the recreational area there is an important step to take into account, be careful when entering and leaving."
84140,1184735,4,marcovan,03/05/2021,"Very busy in the mornings! Be careful if you want to go out, you will not pass all the cars that are parked in any way and block the exit of motorhomes. ideal to disconnect there is no coverage !!! lots of trails, fountains, and garbage cans."
84140,1169061,5,ElMichy,06/04/2021,"Interesting area to sleep. In the morning it is filled with cars, some of which do it incorrectly and without thinking about others. Furniture in the area closed or unusable due to covid"
84140,1156107,5,AnitaNG,23/03/2021,"We went in the marked direction, at the end of the road on the left. We didn't have to put the van in, the area was very quiet, and we slept with two more Campers next to us but without hearing anything Important, there is NO coverage, you stop having it once Once you start to climb the pass, there are trash cans and some fountains. We took a route crossing the road for about 9km, very quiet and without people."
84140,1145184,5,jorgeyelena,01/03/2021,We spent a very quiet night with more Camper and caravans. In the morning cars began to arrive to do routes there and eat in the area but there was no problem leaving the parking lot after eating.
84140,1117329,4,Silviacanovas,23/11/2020,"Beautiful place, surrounded by nature, many routes, but not advisable on the weekend and mushroom season, it fills up early in the morning and it is impossible to go out with the fire or AC, since the rows of cars prevent it, but to get through the night is very quiet. Totally recommended"
84140,1055849,5,Tui,18/09/2020,"Important: there is no coverage. Only Movistar comes and goes with a point, the rest of the companies are not worth it. Water fountains (2), containers, tables... a little uneven but great."
84140,915497,5,anchaescastilla,31/07/2020,"Very cool, beautiful and quiet place, with multiple more or less flat squares and shade. During the week I slept perfectly, almost in complete solitude; Friday and Saturday it was full of people, there was noise all night and in the morning it was all blocked from traffic. Knowing this, magical place. There is drinking water (without pressure) and garbage containers. I had no coverage."
84140,824215,5,AngyBL,14/06/2020,"We arrived Saturday afternoon and no problem parking. Quiet and safe place to sleep accompanied by several vans. Of course, Sunday morning, already full of parked cars that can prevent you from leaving if you go with a van or caravan."
84140,810882,4,LauraMartin,28/05/2020,"Beautiful place with very nice walking routes. But beware, weekend and mushroom season gets to the top. There was barely room to leave the car among the row of parked cars along the driveway. We parked in the back and throughout Sunday we had to be vigilant because they put two rows of cars in front of us. It does not take into account that the CA needs more room to maneuver"
84140,782056,5,Faunaxan,17/02/2020,"Beautiful place to spend the night. It is a very quiet area, but we had a mishap and there is no coverage."

84140,720480,5,IVI79,13/10/2019,Nice place and very lonely at night. But on weekends it gets crowded for the day.
84140,593546,5,vicalu,02/08/2019,20190726. Better at the bottom of the access road. Very quiet to spend the night. Source nearby. Garbage Shades. Multitude of routes on foot or by bike. Abundance of woodland.
84140,473438,5,Rutera13,02/05/2019,Good place to sleep and spend the day there are tables and plenty of space to park in the back. silence and tranquility among pines.

84193,481498,5,verden,11/05/2019,"Assuredly a very nice place to spend a night, very quiet, I recommend visiting the castle. There will be festivities at the castle on the 17th, 18th and 19th of May."

84228,3269036,4,boubou2002,07/09/2023,no practical free barrier
84228,3243415,5,AssunP,31/08/2023,Currently there is no control of this spot and you can get water and leave black water for free. Very useful!
84228,3225023,3,alcrisydobito,27/08/2023,"The City Council is going to close the area, many incivicos that do not respect the rules. Garbage thrown under a sign asking that nothing be left, because there is no collection service, it is also the third time this month that someone has broken the access barrier."
84228,3218526,5,DFS,25/08/2023,"Thanks to the town hall for this area. The entrance barrier has been vandalized and you can enter without a code. Despite that, I have paid the 5 euros and I encourage everyone to do so to show the council that motorhomes do not go around destroying the facilities that they make available to us and we are civilized people. I hope this parking lot doesn't close."
84228,3212385,4,aesteban91,24/08/2023,"We were there on 07/2023 and there was still no charge, a good place to spend the night, next to the road but you can't hear the cars, you have an Eroski next door and a couple of gas stations, but it's a bit far from the beach , but it is not bad at all considering that in that area there are hardly any places with filling and emptying services, there is no garbage, it is important that the water intake is 3/4 """
84228,3195154,5,MatteoCassia,21/08/2023,"Legal parking for motorhomes, convenient for access with services included. It would seem that a registration and payment is required but unfortunately in the last few weeks it has been vandalized a bit (according to the managers of the nearby campsites) and because of this the Municipality of Castillo has decided to close it from September. At the moment access is free, pity about the incivility of the people."
84228,3182717,5,arimode,19/08/2023,"The broken fence and litter is not the fault of the caravanners, but rather someone who is annoyed that this service exists. Ask the Noja camping mafia."
84228,3181182,3,NURIARIERAE,19/08/2023,Broken fence today. In September they close for misuse and banditry
84228,3181137,4,DanielMolina,19/08/2023,"When we got to the Area we found the barrier broken and the ground full of garbage. It seems that they are going to close it due to the incivility of the people. Does it cost so much to throw garbage elsewhere if there is no container? The payment system they applied was very deficient, but isn't it better to send an e-mail to the town hall to propose a change? We can't always get everything for free"
84228,3137888,4,cynthiarodrguez,13/08/2023,"Clean and easy to access by registering on the web. I pay €5 per night, maximum 48 hours. The only problem is that there are people who register and pay only for emptying/filling water and AC arrives at sunset and even when the parking lot is half empty, it does not allow them access because the maximum number of registrations has already been completed."
84228,3128056,4,BuYuBu,12/08/2023,"Overnight area with a price of €5. Super clean, level spaces. Automated mobile entry and registration. Perfect service area to maneuver. To take into account that it is next to the road and there is sound of cars. We have slept perfectly."

84228,3108938,3,amabia5,09/08/2023,"They have paid for it and it seems fine to me, the downside is that you cannot enter to unload or load water (paying) without spending the night... when you enter you make the reservation for a place and even if you do not stay to spend the night that place cannot be Reserve no one nor can you enter to empty. It is a shame that due to the misuse that is done in September they close it."
84228,3100566,4,cisne1,08/08/2023,"€4, 24h, maximum 48h. Perfect to visit Trasmiera ecopark, house of the tides, hiking in Monte Cincho"

84228,3057181,5,Kram907,01/08/2023,Asphalted area with all services. Payment soon thanks to neighbors who use the services for other purposes. Very quiet night.
84228,3029911,3,josemva,27/07/2023,"Normal area, everything works correctly, to stop and spend one or two nights and continue, it will be paid for the abuse that is subjected to housing vehicles and other types of vehicles and it is the most normal. Thanks to the City Council for this Area and to the users for paying for it."

No signs in place to say if this will change. 3kms bike ride to Noja beach which was lovely - cold showers at beach if required !
84228,2944909,2,angoitia,10/07/2023,PAYMENT. By the end of July it will be paid. They still do not know the price. You will have to download an application and pay.

84228,2900818,4,Escalam,28/06/2023,"perfect place to fill and empty gray and black, one drawback is that there is only one tap to fill and it is the same to clean the black cassette, you have to be careful to disinfect it before filling the tank with clear water"

84228,2570135,3,arimode,06/02/2023,"We still have no water as of February 6, 2023, this sounds like a political issue. Otherwise, gray and black water can be emptied. The place is starting to deteriorate."

They have attributed the decision to the lack of water that they suffer, but it seemed to me to be a political decision, otherwise they would have told me that as soon as the situation changes, they will give the water. And they have alluded to me that it was free, and since I don't pay, I can't complain if they don't have water."

84228,2267929,2,Carlosb1,19/08/2022,There is to empty gray and black water. the faucet does not work. You can refuel at the gas station and ask them to let you carry water. Surely the fact that there is no water has something to do with the private area of Somo that knowingly charges €5 for the recharge
84228,2261817,2,S.L.F,18/08/2022,"Place very close to the road. Although there is a tap, the water is cut off. Gray water and black water can be emptied. (Although there is someone who has decided to empty their black water into the gray water grid)."

84228,2055313,3,Alf1e,10/07/2022,"Ok for a night, it's next to quite a busy road but the main thing that'll keep you awake is rude people turning up at past 12pm! Only one water tap fed by black irrigation pipe, so probably best to boil it! Local garage doesn't do snacks, only has a trucker cafe. Repsol left at the roundabout (3mins drive) is open late if desperate."
84228,2013460,4,Jaimerg,26/06/2022,"In this area there are very few places for loading and unloading. And only this one is free. We spent the night and the night traffic did not bother us. Therefore, congratulations to the city council of Arnuero."

I would advice continuing for a 100 m on the dirt road, there's a little T and space for one vehicle. It's a tad bumpy but nothing too bad if you take it slowly, and the spot is way better. Enjoy and don't leave toilet paper if you do it as our ancestors did please :)"

I didn't feel comfortable leaving the car there so went to 11 Avenida Gola del Punchol 46012. It was the best choice! There is very wide, quiet, facing the beach and with many motohomes - is the tip!"

We Woke when for a swim in the beach. Made breakfast just as the locals where arriving for a day at the beach. Benches where nice and shaded. Some cool cats living nearby feed them a tin of sardines. As local council workers picked up rubbish and emptied the bins. The carpark was well lit. Would definitely recommend as a place to spend the night.
84391,533578,1,SiraQuiroga,30/06/2019,"EYE, short places, insufficient even for cars of 6m like mine. The police pass during the day several times and fine if you are outside the limit of the squares. Out of season I do not know but in summer nothing advisable."
84391,509898,5,eddie88,09/06/2019,"Top! Water, shower, toilet and medical center within a walking distance. If you come in the day you will not park, it will be full. After 19 its start to get free. In the morning busy again. So you will probably be lock inside, which is a good excuse for police. In the day there are parking renter with their own private area right in front, i believe they will have a look also on your van!"
84391,486918,1,BeauLunaBus,18/05/2019,Just got to the car park and there is some one ‘manning’ each car park section and saying you have to pay €1. They were leaning up against our van. It all felt extremely dodgy and very unsafe. Definitely wouldn’t stay the night and we turned around after parking up for 20 mins only
84391,476850,3,mcmx,05/05/2019,We ended up here because parking complicated or impossible in the city. Here the car parks are deserts out of season. By cons the paella eaten in a nearby restaurant was not good;)

84391,449170,3,mimijojo45,05/04/2019,"Very good for one night we were 2 campers cars and a heavy weight because a lot of space this season and close to the beach.

84428,1682294,4,bichosvan,08/11/2021,"Spacious and with large squares between trees. In the city center, this is why it is noisier, especially when the movement begins tomorrow. Less than 10 minutes from the promenade."
84428,1653279,5,EladioPonce,19/10/2021,We have been two nights. Ideal to see Almuñecar. There is only one problem that on Thursday from 00:00 until Friday at 12:00 you cannot park. There is a market.
84428,1610863,3,conchialba,26/09/2021,Good place to park we have not missed but you can do it perfectly. Many services nearby. Very beautiful beach except for the sand that is missing because they are made of pebbles

84428,410148,2,F.L.Ortiz,26/11/2018,"I arrived late and parked at the end of the walk, in front of the pharmacy, where it made less noise. At 6 in the morning they knocked on the door and I had to leave because a market was held. Almuñécar is an inhospitable city for motor caravanners."

84478,1132281,1,bitesize,22/01/2021,Given that it’s a dead end it was busy with traffic. Lots of cars just coming and turning around. Some parking for a short while. I personally didn’t feel overly safe. Some road works very close by so it was noisy during their work hours too. Quiet night due to the curfew. There’s another park up literally around the corner to the right that is right on the beach and had a couple of other vans on there. We didn’t go because it was starting to flood due to very heavy rain

84519,2886531,4,seluuzr,24/06/2023,"Quiet parking, but always in company which gives security. It is close to several beaches, you can spend the night perfectly."
84519,2870406,5,Hobbyoptima,19/06/2023,"Also perfect for large mobile homes or teams. The ground is rocky/sandy but firm. And dear Lifestyle Van friends, buy a toilet. It's all full of toilet paper and wet wipes, no wonder parking is so heavily restricted in Portugal."
84519,2869898,5,mareeen,19/06/2023,"Very nice and clean parking lot, where you can also eat comfortably outside. We spent the night quietly and carefree. Directly from the parking lot you can walk in about 10 minutes to a breathtaking view of the sea where you can do a nice coast run."
84519,2812861,5,Davidverde,02/06/2023,Cleared the entire parking lot of all trash today. I hope he stays clean! Garbage can is just before the main street. So easy to dispose of the garbage.
84519,2770949,4,Kartoffelsuppe,21/05/2023,"Can only agree: Large, flat parking lot. Stood here one night with no problems. However, a lot of rubbish and the dog next door keeps barking at night. If you walk to the coast (5 minutes) you have great bays and beaches at low tide. Otherwise you can also take a nice walk on the cliffs."
84519,2719502,4,AvocadoDrivers,03/05/2023,"Large flat parking lot. Access a bit bumpy. To the beach of Prainha about 10-15 minutes. The path is not directly signposted, so you have to look for something. Stood here only during the day."

Had enough space. There were 3 other vans there, but all of them were very calm and decent. You can walk to the beach in less than 5 minutes. If you dare to drive under it, it is quite steep (not recommended for campers here!) No control by GNR."

84519,1582041,2,phoenix.factory,15/09/2021,"The place is poorly attended. On the one hand, the motorhomes venture beyond the parking lot, into the forest; on the other hand, the place is frequented by idle young people who come to listen to very loud music, smoke weed and address tourists in an unfriendly and insulting tone. At nightfall, the atmosphere becomes heavy and not very reassuring."

84519,1331358,5,AnaCampana,17/07/2021,"Wide and clean lot, without shade. We parked a few hours during the day to take a walk around the tip of Joao Arenas and the nearby coves, there were 2 or 3 more motorhomes, we did not see any sign of prohibited AC.

84519,1064115,2,sergionunes52,22/09/2020,"1 night spent quietly. But I found it to be a very dirty place, the fact that it has no services does not mean that we are “pigs”. It is a field without a view. Beautiful view only with pedestrian access."
84519,1048889,5,rampa,14/09/2020,"We spent 2 nights together with some campers, very quiet place. It is dirt and at this time a lot of dust is raised, otherwise everything is fine, we will repeat!"

84519,1015083,4,Rebbilicious,30/08/2020,"The space itself is not very spectacular, but the bays, which can be reached in a few minutes, are all the more so. Quite a lot of activity during the day in the high season. Quiet in the evening. Unfortunately, here too, as in so many other places in Portugal, a lot of rubbish. Please also take your toilet paper etc. with you or throw it in the garbage can at the entrance to the street. This is not only good for the environment, but also for all other campers and locals who want to spend a good time here :)"

84519,794476,5,passum,12/03/2020,We stood very well here for 3 days. There is a large disposal bin on the road to the parking lot. It is a nice stretch of coast for hiking. Approx. 300 meters to the sea. It's just a shame about the amount of toilet paper that is lying here. But it is certainly not only for campers who do not have a toilet. Too bad. It's a matter of time before space is gone.
84519,793237,5,Lowe96,09/03/2020,Stayed here one night. Quiet night. One other camper here. Nice wander down to the cliffs. Main issue is the amount of toilet paper and wet wipes left by people. If you arrive here please clean up a little bit even if it isn’t yours!
84519,791823,4,MelissaNoa,06/03/2020,"The place isn‘t really beautiful, but ok for a night. I stayed here for the night with 4 other campers. The cliffs are really nice.

84519,645883,5,Jesvenro,20/08/2019,Small and somewhat dirty parking because people throw everything on the ground. Walking 5 minutes you arrive at an area where there is a hole in the land and you see the sea in the background and a beautiful nudist beach and of poor access if you go with children since they are narrow paths of dirt downhill. The beautiful views and the super quiet place! There is almost no one in the area. Perfect to relax and disconnect.
84519,604410,5,mochileros,06/08/2019,"The parking is normal. But 5 minutes walking is the beach of the photos. Nudist, in total 5 people arrived throughout the day, beautiful and quiet. We ask a local to know how to get there, there is a small road that takes you."

So we gave up despite the fact that the place was really beautiful and conducive to spending the night there. Just be careful not to go to the end of the road, we had to go back several meters because it was impossible to turn around"
84541,2997371,5,mcnach,21/07/2023,"Paved access except for a final part of land in good condition. Do not pay attention to google maps, because it directs you through complicated paths, take the road that leaves the gas station. No police for two nights (Wednesday and Thursday). During the day there are several cars of people who go to the beach, at night almost empty. Follow the barrier but you can leave the car near the walkway."

When approaching, Google Maps likes to choose adventurous routes through the forest, but there is also a paved route (only the last stretch is gravel). A Portuguese advised us not to stay here alone, he had seen shady characters at night."
84541,2460881,5,FCV91,24/10/2022,"We had a magnificent view and stayed two nights. There are numerous pitches, even if you follow the path to the left into the pine forest. There areas with shade from large pine trees. I collected pines there and ate them with risotto ;-)"

84541,1774515,4,domiho,05/03/2022,Really good place! You need to be careful how Google navigation guides you because it leads through a closed road. The right turn is earlier in the town of Alfarim right in front of the BP station. On the map this road is called R. da Amieira and it leads straight to the place. You also have to drive a little further than the point on the map. There are many good places to park. Have a great time!

84541,1245362,4,JD2906,09/06/2021,"A very nice pitch with a great view. Easy access to the sea, nice waves and a good atmosphere. During the day (especially on weekends) the nearby parking lot is quite full, but it was empty at night. From the pitch you could see both the sunrise and the sunset. Unfortunately a bit dirty, we first had to clear away a little rubbish."
84541,1107088,5,tiberghien,27/10/2020,"Despite the description of the place, there is no sign indicating that the night is prohibited. We therefore chose to go and stand 300 m further on to the left under the pines. We had an excellent night without being disturbed (off season?), Lulled by the sound of the waves."
84541,673570,1,hans85,02/09/2019,Hello very sandy and very bad road. Big holes. The GNR has sent us away staying overnight is not allowed. So be careful!

84541,299851,3,JS7,24/07/2018,"Fantastically beautiful to see the sunset, you will never stand alone, the topic is rather that you get a place right on the beach. The deduction is unfortunately because you should break up in the morning in time or only in the evening, we were on weekends and parked until the evening pretty."

84579,2353168,4,elsincroman,08/09/2022,"there is a covered area. the problem if the weather is good, is that being near a park, there is a lot of noise. It is a good place to spend the night. there is a nearby fountain and a small supermarket."

84582,670534,5,nocillastrip,31/08/2019,"Parking of the park reception center. Good option if you don't mind sleeping alone in nature. Quieter than the Es Grau car park, which is attached to the road and looked like an illegal campsite. Without services Flat. With wildlife visits during the night. The park guards arrived at 9 and greeted without hitting."

Very quiet.. fresh water available."
84685,3227230,2,IlaRiva,27/08/2023,"Very convenient for the center, but not very easy for long campers. We didn't find it a safe parking space to leave the motorhome unattended. A few people were wandering among the cars."
84685,3027877,4,gpchia,27/07/2023,"Very central parking, small squares...it is usually very crowded. at night and early morning if there are free places. there are no services. I recommend the cafeteria 818 murrieta which is very close for a great croissant with coffee with milk and orange juice for 3.50, and a clean toilet and WC. open from very early in the morning. the rest are closed until 9:00. There is a Mercadona nearby."
84685,2465614,1,lloydh,27/10/2022,We stopped in the car park adjacent which is a paid parking. We parked and paid and then as we were about to walk off  noticed a car parked across with 3 men in it. They sat and waited until we were across the road and then they drove up next to our van. We went back and they pulled off and drove around the car park passing us several times. It was clear their intentions. Stay away in my opinion
84685,2054107,3,crisala07,09/07/2022,"Good for parking and hanging out downtown and on Laurel Street, but not for sleeping. We slept in the one with the waterwheels."
84685,1554437,3,Javielzape,06/09/2021,"It is a parking lot close to the center but in the parking spaces there is no room for a two-seater motorhome, a van yes, apart from the police told us that with a motorhome we could not park here, and that it is a place of bottle and habitual robberies."
84685,1013765,3,laida,30/08/2020,"We have been two days in the free parking lot two minutes from downtown, Laurel street and the old town! To find a place it is ideal to park in the morning, at night it is difficult to find a place! There are no toilets!"
84685,839379,2,Mofli2020,28/06/2020,"Only recommended for campers, there is usually no place. Do not enter with integrals like the one in the photo."
84685,797505,1,amoran,27/03/2020,"It is not a site for AC. Difficult to maneuver or not occupy more than one place. On the other side of the Ebro (5 minutes walk along the footbridge) you have the whole place in the world, accompanied by other ACs and with plenty. Here everything but a conditioned van. Something 6 m is already big."
84685,543242,4,27Cebiches27,07/07/2019,Very close to the center and easy to park although it is not suitable for caravans. Not very suitable for overnight.

84685,402721,1,Capora,02/11/2018,Very central but narrow for motorhome of 7 m. The seats are small. It was full. We have gone to the parking lot on the other side of the river.
84712,3016021,4,bimbaraner,25/07/2023,"Parking in the same port of Santoña. Ideal for visiting the town. Without services but central. If the noises bother you, it's not your place, we personally have spent a wonderful night."
84712,2900838,5,Escalam,28/06/2023,"very good place if you don't mind the noise of cars, boat engines and seagulls, a step away from the port and the town with many good restaurants next door, beach nearby, to refuel and an area 7.5km from the parking lot, it's worth it just to see how they unload the bonito del Norte and many other species, and return"
84712,2388245,5,javyalonso,20/09/2022,"For me, a very good area being a parking lot in the city. You sleep peacefully, with the port and views of the estuary behind. The only thing, for those who find it hard to sleep or in summer because of the open windows, is the noise like the hum (not loud) of some nearby machinery from the port, but we have slept perfectly. Also, when you leave the AC you are already on the beautiful Paseo de Santoña."
84712,2178463,1,MariayAlejandro,05/08/2022,"There is no problem spending the night there, but there is no service, it does not have nice views, you look at the port and the industrial estate. At night there is quite a lot of noise. I do not recommend sleeping in Santoña"
84712,1837794,4,MariaJVG,19/04/2022,"enough space for many ACs and vans. View of the marshes, tranquility, but next to the industrial estate. In the morning there is movement and people who go fishing. It is close to the center on foot and shops"

84712,1592466,1,Consolos,19/09/2021,"Nightmare night for the bottle. Last night, 15 motorhomes / campers parked in the same place, until 7 AM at least, a lot of teenagers messing around in the area. Apart important unevenness and a lot of commotion from walkers. Better the other location to the left of the town when you enter, better to walk 10 more minutes and rest. Santoña a wonder not to be missed"
84712,1544303,3,GarciaFamily,03/09/2021,"Very close to the center and without problems to spend the night. We easily found room for our a / c which is quite large.

84712,1282374,5,ritayandres,28/06/2021,"Next to the port, you sleep well, it was 10 AC, the entrance seems narrow but it is fine, you can see signs 3.3 m high and motorhomes prohibited but they are for underground parking, outdoors on the promenade you can spend the night perfectly. From here I encourage you to put comments on the sites where you spend the night, we like to go to sites with many positive comments but then we do not write."

84712,430120,3,bruce,17/02/2019,Free parking area. Right in front of the port. Very busy and hard to find place on weekends and I guess on holidays. Better to arrive soon or late to be able to find a space. For the rest it is already a luxury to be able to park without being fined.

It is a tad separated from the road, so I do not know how much noise there can be at night, but I do not see it at all bad. To spend the day, go to the beach and get to know the town, it is very good. I will repeat. My car is more than 7m and without problems.
