110839,2041242,3,curtisg53,05/07/2022,"Arrived at 7pm on a Tuesday evening, small car park full of cars. New sports building being erected. Bays only car size so not suitable for ACs."
110839,1291687,5,danielpv,02/07/2021,Parking in a very quiet and solitary sports center. the streetlights give you a hard time at night and you have to position the vehicle well. the managers of the center are very friendly and allow you to shower in the inhalations. It has a slope in most of the squares but there are some that are straight
110839,1233400,5,Tamarindo86,03/06/2021,"Ample parking for vans. We don't sleep, we just stop to shower. It is a small pavilion in which you can shower with hot water and without paying. Super clean. There are dryers."
110839,608956,3,3435dominique,08/08/2019,"Parking quite quiet at night despite a lot of passage to the gym and pool. It really has only 5 seats as far right as possible. No service except a trash. For large motorhomes, mistrust with the overhang in the descent of the car park. Swimming pool open from 12 o'clock. Good for troubleshooting"
110839,608469,3,Daikiara,08/08/2019,It is a municipal sports area. It was very clean. There was no one at the entrance. We pass directly to the changing room area. 3 showers with hot water. In the sink area they had a hairdryer. It is somewhat apart. It also has a pool.
110845,3279796,5,hangrieric,10/09/2023,"very beautiful campsite, large pitches, very good sanitary facilities, unlimited hot water, very pretty private beach, two very pretty swimming pools, super good and plentiful restaurant, we will come back, I recommend with my eyes closed"
110845,3155014,4,Fafa1,15/08/2023,"We are happy to come back to this lovely campsite. Good sanitary facilities, nice swimming pool, private beach. A little expensive all the same, 50 euros/day 1cc 2 pers. with electricity in August."
110845,2784587,4,xevi4rodes,25/05/2023,Excellent camping. Services are correct and cleaned often. In the restaurant they are very attentive and make 5-star paellas. Only the service area for motorhomes should be improved. It's a pity that climbing and diving activities are not available.
110845,2731688,2,worldexplorer6163,07/05/2023,A jewel in a beautiful natural setting - unfortunately the splendor of earlier times has long since faded and everything is dilapidated - a pity...
110845,2725305,3,beb-lu,05/05/2023,"Very nice campsite, after the weekend of the 1st lay it was a lot quieter. We chose our location, very large, 2 steps from the sea, at the foot of the mountain. A plus: supermarket where you can find everything (fresh breads, fruits and vegetables.. the very nice manager. Mixed sanitary facilities, cleaned only once a day, showers with push button, so little water and bad smells. Water for cold dishes ."
110845,2707562,4,AnitaLotze,29/04/2023,cute place. lots of walking in the mountains. large pitches. good private beach. a supermarket with lots of food and not only chippies. a very hot swimming pool and that's perfect for the winter. quiet
110845,2680149,4,valmartin,18/04/2023,"very pleasant campsite in mid-April. large pitches, near the private beach and more or less clean sanitary facilities. indoor swimming pool, supermarket and restaurant open, on the heights. Note that the city of Cartagena (very pretty) is 20 minutes by car, because we took a taxi. otherwise, a bus stop is 20 minutes by bike from the campsite. ACSI at 23 euros. we will definitely be back"
110845,2580298,3,Semmi736631,17/02/2023,"Great location, but in my opinion too expensive for what is offered. 28 eu plus wifi, 1 person vwbus"
110845,2500937,1,boxerbus,20/11/2022,faded glory no water points at the place messy bad little places there must be a person who likes to collect money but does not give it back to the visitors 28 euros / night old sanitary facilities no toilet paper wifi 3 euros / day nice and commercial
110845,2494594,3,fan4womo,13/11/2022,"The price with ACSI is just about right. However, the fact that the covered pool is out of order and the showers are cleaned at 10/11 in the morning and cannot be used is annoying and the space is therefore too expensive. A lot of flies, some of which also sting. Also on the beach! Electricity only 4 amps a day! Also too little for 22 € price. Partly very unkempt. Must have been flooded."
110845,2460839,4,Ette68,24/10/2022,"Nice place downstairs. Unfortunately there was nothing more free. The pool and the sea are fantastic. The food in the restaurant was also delicious. The beach bar is closed. We are very high up, opposite the parking lot. The cars pass here very quickly. We would have liked to have stayed but preferred further down."
110845,2373412,3,Aventurier73,15/09/2022,campsite very well located but pitch for motorhome sometimes difficult to access the campsite deserves a renovation
110845,2285427,4,park4nightDaida,22/08/2022,"The campsite is very good, very clean, the beach is fantastic, it has everything. Negative points: the reception lady is very rude and many people access as visitors to the beach."
110845,2114508,3,W2T,24/07/2022,"Actually a nice campsite but unfortunately you should know that there are many day visitors who only come to the private beach to swim! Therefore, this private beach is very crowded, there are parasols next to parasols. What a pity the bay is so beautiful with crystal clear sea."
110845,2110719,5,Isabella_Uma,23/07/2022,"Unbeatable environment! Spacious pitches, very friendly staff. The pool and restaurant are very nice. It cost us €52 (2 pax animal electricity)."
110845,1969633,4,iremarma,12/06/2022,"Naturist campsite. Good atmosphere, good services, practically private beach. Shaded pitches. Between sea and mountain."
110845,1899193,3,xoucla,18/05/2022,"Well located campsite. A bit dated overall. Drinking water, gray water and cassettes are scattered all over the camp."
110845,1760365,5,Van4life64,19/02/2022,"Fantastic naturist campsite even in winter! very warm welcome and spacious pitches with an astoundingly beautiful landscape (sea and mountain) private beach, restaurant and bar, 2 swimming pools, one of which is covered, water, electricity, drainage and filling water, (spa and massage and jacuzzi at an additional cost), mini-market, clean sanitary facilities , quiet. All that for €28 with 10A of electricity is a given! I recommend"
110845,1617356,5,Javierspicazo,29/09/2021,"Amazing site, highly recommended. The beach is private and very beautiful. It has a supermarket, swimming pool, restaurant and SPA. Very respectful and quiet environment. The buts; the bathrooms that can be improved and the pitches are better limited. But it's the best we've seen."
110845,1381814,1,stuaty,30/07/2021,"We came for 3 nights and the first one we left. Until 4 in the morning some kids in the restaurant area making a bottle / party with their corresponding music. The maintenance workers in the area but they did not pay any attention. A lot of car until 00:00 I suppose that of the stragglers who enter only for the beach. Very dirty bathroom / shower area, we do not clean a few times Dwarf plots"
110845,1269435,4,Rapid33,21/06/2021,"Good services, perhaps a lack of maintenance of the sites. very nice place."
110845,1257991,3,StijnKaty,16/06/2021,"Campsite could use a refresh. Still quiet in June, but I don't want to be here in full season. Pebble beach. Only the first 6 places are with a sea view"
110845,1162375,5,JohnBarret,31/03/2021,"They have improved the supermarket a lot. The toilets are very clean and the indoor pool is in perfect condition. The atmosphere, as always, very pleasant."
110845,1091991,3,Fafa1,13/10/2020,"Unfriendly reception, extremely minimalist grocery store, nice pool and superb setting."
110845,939494,3,Patvat,08/08/2020,Campsite located in a beautiful cove well equipped with a lovely swimming pool. Sanitary cleaned and disinfected twice a day therefore closed for a long time. A very small store that only opens in the morning.
110845,817576,4,JohnBarret,06/06/2020,"Great. Very pleasant and totally respectful environment. Few people right now, giving you even more peace of mind. Pool in perfect condition. We will be back."
110845,779198,5,Familie-M.,11/02/2020,"For me one of the most beautiful campsites in the area. Have been there for the second time, met many nice people there. Sanitary facilities are a bit old but fully functional. The area is a true Eldorado for me as a mountain bike and hiking enthusiast. Cartagena can be reached quickly by mountain bike via the Rambla. Fresh baguettes and croissants can be bought in the shop every morning. I'll be back"
110845,680836,5,LaCercadelAlcornoque,07/09/2019,"A paradise for naturists, an idyllic enclave to rest and disconnect. Routes for tas trails and transparent waters. We come back"
110845,669993,2,thereus,31/08/2019,Too expensive for what you get. It is almost impossible to cycle away. Beach bar is nice and beer 1 euro.
110845,664647,4,allorente,28/08/2019,"Nudist campsite with a very pleasant atmosphere. Very friendly and friendly staff. The only bad thing is the price, a bit high for the services it offers, especially in high season."
110845,614003,5,esmaa,09/08/2019,Absolutely amazing site. Secluded and very comfortable. With all amenities at hand. Highly recommend. We will be back
110845,608228,4,J-M-A,07/08/2019,"Good naturist campsite with nice beach next door. Superb site, surrounded by mountains. Restaurant very good with good value for money. We recommend !"
110845,586528,5,Micamper,30/07/2019,"The best camping we have visited, very friendly people, clean facilities, very good pool, amazing beach, we highly recommend it, we went with our baby. We will be back!!"
110845,558460,5,carlosblay,17/07/2019,"Great naturist camping with ""almost"" private beach. Familiar and friendly atmosphere. We recommend it a lot."
110845,430002,1,mamichadsm,16/02/2019,We went there and we suffered 1 refusal for access to the drain terminal which is reserved for customers according to the owner
110845,426282,3,perambulator,02/02/2019,Lovely site with good clean facilities. Sheltered beach of shingle.
110860,2680192,4,jfms,18/04/2023,superb view of Jaén. great vantage point to watch the sunset. at the start of a beautiful hiking trail where we could see ibexes. it is above all a take-off area for paragliding and therefore a lot of people but at 9 p.m. we were alone.
110860,2658964,3,avlan,10/04/2023,"Very cool views although too windy at night. Difficult to get the camping gas out with so much wind, unless you take shelter on the porch of the booth. The water in the fountain is activated by a button on the floor."
110860,2643557,4,jessy74,06/04/2023,"for those who love nature, landscapes and walks. Calm night but this day windy and then dusty. Too bad. Pedestrian cars during the day. No water to refill. Very little throughput."
110860,2515486,5,lidi_ss,07/12/2022,"Very good place to stop, incredible views. There are tables and barbecues, bins and containers, all very clean. From here comes a route to do. We did not stay to sleep but it is a good option."
110860,1324958,5,juulap,14/07/2021,"Magnificent view, fountain, many people come to picnic there in the evening but very quiet night."
110860,1173097,3,LisaBooms97,13/04/2021,"This was a good spot to spend a night. I would not recommend to stay longer than one night, because it is not a beautiful place."
110860,1161934,1,oceeme,31/03/2021,It is a place as cool as the amount of garbage is extraordinary everywhere. A shame.
110860,1137623,5,tiph14,15/02/2021,"Super spot with a beautiful view, very popular on weekends but quiet at night. a water source closed on that date."
110860,1077187,5,Missin,01/10/2020,"Very quiet place from 9pm, since before there are quite a few people walking. views of all the olive groves and magnificent sunset. I stood behind the booth so that the possible lights of the cars would not shine on me. highly recommended. there are picnic tables"
110863,3279557,5,Hpovoa,10/09/2023,"a Wing with shower with hot water, very clean. Internet in Cinfães, you can only get it at the opposite end of the entrance, that's where the router is, next to the changing rooms there seems to be one but it doesn't emit any signal at all. the individual potable water taps in each place lack the handle. but there are other faucets. there is space and quiet to rest."
110863,3254114,4,j0nasw,03/09/2023,"A super nice and tidy parking lot. We spent the night here, it was very quiet. Free electricity, bathroom a bit dirty, showers very good and warm."
110863,3237341,5,lyndawood,30/08/2023,"amazing overnight stop with free, clean
 toilets, hot showers and electricity (make sure you have the connector for Portugal).supermarket and bar close by.  very scenic road to get here with lovely views of the Douro.  thank you to the village for this exceptional stop."
110863,3234515,5,jephilavelo,29/08/2023,very good electricity and free water hot shower available very clean thanks to the municipality.
110863,3231111,5,bateauenmer,28/08/2023,very very good France has a lot to learn thank you to the community
110863,3215843,5,Europaeer,25/08/2023,Very good place. Toilets and showers are very clean. Shower with warm water. Everything is free. Thank you to the community. Were on site 8/2023.
110863,3125894,3,esthergoro,12/08/2023,"The pit where the gray water is dumped was at the top, impossible to empty the poti there. The bathrooms are in very poor condition, doors torn off and showers stuck with flanges, at least they work and there is hot water. The electrical plugs come out of a 3-hole socket. To enter the slope is at least 12%, take this into account to leave since large or old motorhomes will not be able to."
110863,3121733,4,leventkaya,11/08/2023,"everything is free. free wifi by municipal. quite calm. hot shower, clean toilets. near to park. there is no shade at all. there is a huge park nearby  entrance is a bit narrow."
110863,3118725,5,FallObst,10/08/2023,"A place with everything you need and for free?! Really great view, hot shower, toilets, electricity and utilities. The only ""criticism"": The disposal of the black water was very dirty. Nevertheless 5 stars for a phenomenal place and completely free! We will be back definitely! Almost too good to be true. But only almost :)"
110863,3113819,5,MaridaGrassi,10/08/2023,"Parking area complete with all services for caravans. Hot shower, games for children and exercise equipment for adults, beautiful view. Sloping entrance, caution."
110863,3082037,5,BeauLunaEdvantures,05/08/2023,"Absolutely amazing ! how is this free ! better than most camper sites. Free water, free electric, free hot showers ! black water waste not the most hygienic, but hey loads of seating areas - even has a small book swap library and nice kids play area. Thank you so much to the municipality this is a beachmark for all other locations to live up to. And although access is tight no issues for a 6.5m van"
110863,3077142,5,huuronzecamper,04/08/2023,"Thank you municipality for this service! We were passing by and positively surprised by the hot showers and the clean environment.

Entering and departing seemed more difficult than it really was with our 8m camper."
110863,3076026,4,Chyl,04/08/2023,Great air with plenty of services (shower toilet games for children and air drain) but complicated to access. For a 7m20 it touched below without damage to enter the parking lot and to maneuver and go to the emptying area remains complicated if there are people. Cassette emptying clogged so it was everywhere. Passage of cars on the road against the area so noisy.
110863,3065116,2,thacole,02/08/2023,"Looks really gorgeous and would have gladly stayed the night but the access is extremely steep, I feared I wouldn't be able to get out with my old camper so I drove on."
110863,3044516,5,monkeystop,30/07/2023,Incredible that this is free and so well maintained. A heartfelt thanks to the municipality
110863,3026868,5,sanmy,27/07/2023,"A great night, the bathrooms very clean, the showers with hot and clean water, and the best thing is a tower to plug in your camper for free electricity, that is if you have to have the 3-pin adapter. The views at night are very cool, no noise, the area is very quiet. Thanks to the town hall of souselo for making an area like this. I recommend it 100%"
110863,3021425,5,Clari80,26/07/2023,Wonderful place !! Thanks to the municipality for the free services.
110863,3018883,4,doisamerricanos,25/07/2023,The driveway is not without. For a big car. Just don't drive down the road. There is no exit
110863,3013910,5,Slybz,24/07/2023,"Amazing ! Really a big thank you to this municipality which has the merit of making an area of this type for people in vans/motorhomes. Everything is there, water, electricity, toilets with shower and hot water! Emptying of waste water. All this for free... Really amazing!"
110863,2984692,3,jo22,18/07/2023,"very difficult access, steep slope to get out on the main road. entrance to the cc area not wide, long length beware of the overhang. pity the frame looks beautiful. so I didn't stay."
110863,2981563,5,Siegburg03,18/07/2023,"Super pitch, with free showers, toilets and electricity. Picnic tables and a supermarket around the corner. The baker came in the morning. Slept very peacefully! Use the first parking lot entrance."
110863,2979991,5,Bisonmarine44390,17/07/2023,"We had lunch to this tune, very pleasant. Very nice view and services available. Drinking water, showers, toilets… spending several nights there is quite possible. Thanks to the municipality."
110863,2939117,5,stoilovelena,08/07/2023,"I loved it, surprisingly clean and cared for. Very quiet at night despite being next to the road. There is a bar and a supermarket opposite. The beautiful views. Be careful when entering large vehicles because it is uphill and somewhat narrow"
110863,2934405,5,brakoe,07/07/2023,"A great, clean place, with a beautiful view. Thanks to the community."
110863,2927814,3,papet50,05/07/2023,Really perfect area. I confirm the previous comments. Camping car 7.50 maximum. Thanks to the municipality of Souselo
110863,2921570,5,snoopy44,04/07/2023,"Superb area with all free services including very clean showers and toilets. Be careful, however, at the entrance level for large motorhomes because it is not very wide. Thanks to the municipality."
110863,2883445,5,Laviexlavraie,23/06/2023,"Incredible place with showers and toilets available. Superb city in the heights, I recommend the cafe which is located a little higher Sem Stress for a quiet breakfast. Lots of space to park but the electricity terminals are generally all used. I was able to charge my external battery in the toilet. I recommend."
110863,2864719,4,atat732,17/06/2023,All facilities that you need so good to have a hot shower. Very tight to get big campers in and the little access road extremely steep. 8 places up top but plenty more on the lower level without electric hook up. Nice views of the valley but you have to walk up to the church or down the steep track to get a sighting of the river.
110863,2859248,5,katoche58,16/06/2023,"beautiful area with all free services. hot showers, toilets of a cleanliness that is not always found at the campsite electricity. beautiful environment. well done community."

Hats off to the municipality of Souselo, really BRAVO! (we're going to do our shopping and restaurants right next to here suddenly) PS: 7.5m truck and it goes without a hitch contrary to the comments of the low haters... :-/"
110863,2849415,4,jeanmichelgeorget,13/06/2023,the area was complete I settled in the parking lot below
110863,2836521,5,BIGKNM,09/06/2023,"Excellent location, only 8 spaces and we get t the last! Toilet, shower, free electricity and all usual services. Here for bank holiday fiesta, so lots of local wine and not far to return"
110863,2835405,4,alicia2022,09/06/2023,The place is beautiful. but access is scary. not suitable for primary drivers. beginners more than 6 meters very difficult to access
110863,2808303,4,Tifany2805,01/06/2023,"Great location with free electricity and water! But the entrance to the car park is difficult to access, especially for long motorhomes, there is one that had to leave because it was too long. For black water it's clogged..."
110863,2807396,2,Lotus63,31/05/2023,"Beautiful motorhome with all the trimmings, however, the men's shower has already been demolished, as well as the taps for fresh water and the hose is also missing. Very sorry..."

110863,2777899,5,katandgoretti,23/05/2023,"Can’t believe it’s free! Quiet(except church bells in the distance), flat, clean toilets, free electricity and free municipal Wifi, easy access from the main road. No showers anymore but wasn’t expecting that anyways, so still giving five stars. Gorgeous view of the valley: watched the sunset while eating dinner."
110863,2777468,4,Robinwomo,22/05/2023,"A big thank you to the municipality for this free opportunity to spend the night with the Womo. A request to everyone, keep the sanitary wing clean so that everything would be consistent."
110863,2776559,4,DMette,22/05/2023,"Exceptional. After an entrance that I would describe as ""impressive"" you will find a very pleasant setting and well-maintained sanitary facilities. free electricity. only downside the walks are a bit complicated due to lack of sidewalk. restful and calm. thank you city hall."
110863,2775123,4,vwt6raquelyalex,22/05/2023,"Unfortunately, the bathrooms are a bit destroyed due to bad behavior! More respect, everything else is great!"

110863,2757884,4,dedelde,17/05/2023,"Nice pitch. Everything is still free, including electricity and hot showers. We could still drive on it with 7m, not recommended for a long time, also because of the disposal. A specified restaurant 500 m above does not exist."
110863,2748539,5,Balayre,14/05/2023,Superb area bravo and thank you to the municipality
110863,2744702,5,ayoinviaggio,12/05/2023,"Beautiful and thanks to Souselo for this free area. In the morning between 8:40 and 9:00, on the slope in front of the entrance to the camper area, the boy (Philippe) who sells bread and sweets for breakfast stops for a few minutes. Wonderful cuddle in the morning and very low prices. Thanks Souselo"
110863,2741382,5,papidjo,11/05/2023,"thank you to the city, free area with WC, hot shower and electricity, a beautiful view, cafe-bar, food and bread store 50m away, good for us with a scooter to do the Douro valley and the suspension bridge, a uncomplicated for vehicles over 7m, thanks again to this small town."
110863,2737995,1,rrrcmlopes,09/05/2023,"Very dangerous descent with a very narrow curve in the middle to turn towards this park, Motorhome 7.5m impossible, I had to go up in reverse gear to get back on the road. Careful! Motorhomes not recommended. This park is only for vans or small motorhomes."
110863,2719597,2,arbeckd,03/05/2023,"Unfortunately, there are chaos who do not appreciate this actually exemplary place. The toilets are dirty and partially damaged, as are the showers, of which only one works. Ashamed of others - sorry to the community"
110863,2697072,3,jo1986,25/04/2023,"too bad, no space, difficult access, we were able to go to the services with a cc of 7m47 (with difficulty) but I don't think we could have parked!"
110863,2693882,5,Hilde-Gard,24/04/2023,"Hi guys, it's 8 (eight) pitches, no more. If these places are occupied, you've just had bad luck! Anyone who unabashedly parks in a car spoils this great offer for everyone in the medium term."
110863,2688180,5,Elsonc,22/04/2023,"Great free area, very hot showers. Beautiful sunset and view of the mist entering the valley  in the morning.  Get there early if you want one of the 8 free electric spots as it gets very busy.  Noise from the church bells is not overnight."
110863,2682962,4,StefanLaura,20/04/2023,"Nice, free place. It was full, but we were on the P below. Only 1 shower still works. Steep road, but went well (camper 7m)."
110863,2680511,5,obersen,19/04/2023,"One of the most beautiful pitches in Portugal. Thanks to the community. Unfortunately, there are always people who damage the infrastructure (shower)."
110863,2674187,5,LAckermann,16/04/2023,"Great place to stay for the night, with services and showers. Beautiful view as well! Would come back any day. Steep entrance/exit to be aware off and I wouldn't want to go there with anything longer than a van, there was a few auto campers as well, so it's possible."
110863,2666483,5,EuroVR2022,13/04/2023,"Very nice place, great everything is provided and we took a good hot shower. Thanks to the community of Souselo for their welcome."
110863,2659555,5,JanMennenga,10/04/2023,"Very nice and modern parking space with a fantastically beautiful panorama! Toilets and showers are available. Unfortunately, when we arrived, all 8 parking spaces were occupied, which is why we had to stand underneath them in the parking lot, which was perfectly fine. We definitely recommend the pitch!"
110863,2630655,2,Mabese18,30/03/2023,"Caution! Motorhomes over 7m, very steep and narrow driveway, danger of bottoming out and tipping over, so didn't use it. It's a shame, because such pitches are rare in this region."
110863,2627438,5,Ceej271,27/03/2023,"Can't believe this beautiful spot is absolutely free!! Free electricity, water, waste point and showers!! Good local shop opposite parking and amazing views out the van doors! Walk round the park for the perfect sunset spot."
110863,2625330,4,Alain85100,26/03/2023,"Very nice area, with all services, free, why do people not respect, and degrade? watch out for over 7m very steep and sloping entrance and exit."
110863,2622554,5,jpdeeve,24/03/2023,"A big thank you for all this comfort, hoping that travelers will be grateful for it by leaving the places clean... would leave time for small businesses to work"
110863,2622084,4,TatjanaArnst,24/03/2023,"great space, great showers and with electricity. Unfortunately, the entrance is really not without. We have a 6m Sprinter and it was way too tight when we drove out, so that our running board got a good deal of damage. Driving in was no problem."
110863,2620940,5,SergioYBriget,23/03/2023,I confirm all the previous testimonials! Thank you and congratulations to the municipality for this place.
110863,2619080,4,Anatole22,21/03/2023,Little location. It's brand new and free. Fairly quiet despite the nearby road.
110863,2617330,5,alainb1,20/03/2023,Beautiful area. A bit difficult to enter picnic table
110863,2613416,5,bella6644,18/03/2023,"Wow, thank you to the municipality for making this space available to us. The places are large, slightly sloping, but nothing inconvenient. Indeed there was vandalism and it is a pity. We spent a quiet night there and felt very welcome. Another big thank you to the community."
110863,2602179,5,vargagab76,07/03/2023,"Perfect place with great infrastructure! Warm water in the shower even at night, daily cleaned toilets with toilet paper supply, free electricity Not recomended for campers longer than 7 meter, and it is scary to drive in with a tall vehicle due to the side inclined entrance but it worth the try! Strongly recomended! May god keep this goodwill of the town council for long! :)"
110863,2600716,5,vasco85,06/03/2023,Very good location. Deserves a 6th star. Thanks to the municipality
110863,2584803,5,Renateporsch,20/02/2023,We recommend. Toilets clean and showers have hot water. Many thanks to the community. Unfortunately there is vandalism here too and the door of the toilet/shower for people with disabilities is badly damaged. Sad that there are always people who have no respect for other people's property or the community.
110863,2574545,5,AnaPaulaCostaSilva,11/02/2023,A 5 star stay. The park is very nice and well located. We feel welcomed. A thank you to the municipality

110863,2551849,5,Fomblin,14/01/2023,"What a nice place some 50 km East of Porto and above the Douro river. The entrance is a bit narrow and steep and you might need your ramps to level the car horizontally. You can hear the street of course but it’s not too noisy. Today everything is clean, working and available. The nearby church will prevent that we sleep to long though :-) The kids were happy with the playground and it’s a beautiful view over the river valley! Thanks a lot to the local government for such a place."
110863,2542792,5,fernandapilomeca,05/01/2023,Thank you to the Cinfães council for providing such a pleasant space.

There are also toilets and showers, but we didn't use them. The drive in is only a bit steep, but it's super possible if you drive in slowly!"

Everything for free, water, waste water, clean toilet with paper, even hot shower available. Now comes the negative again, this time I call people the cause of vandalism, because a lot was destroyed. Doors switch shower ... too bad ..."
110863,2515250,5,BiermannJupp,07/12/2022,We are here for the second time. Great place with everything you need and this for free. A big thank you to the community. Too bad not everyone knows how to deal with such a place as shower heads and hoses are disappearing.

110863,2499748,5,saucissenomade,19/11/2022,"Not the prettiest of views, but plenty of free service (elec, hot water, wifi). Not many people in this season so ideal. Land obviously flat and protected from the road."
110863,2499564,5,obossdacaravana,18/11/2022,"Very good, with access to essential basic services, such as supermarket, cafe and fuel station within a radius of 100 mt. The view is not directly over the Douro river but just as beautiful The showers are served with hot water and sanitary facilities, also for the disabled Congratulations to the Cinfães municipal council for providing such a great quality space."
110863,2499343,5,reynaldrenou,18/11/2022,"What can I say... and thank you to the municipality. Superb place, super complete wifi, electricity, drain, toilets and showers (even if as usual some damage the equipment) Regarding the entrance which is at 90 degrees, just go down to the lower car park, turn around and hop you can enter without hanging. Almost flat location, safe children's playground and very friendly village"

110863,2492721,5,Kikitravels,12/11/2022,Lovely place to park for a night or two. There isn’t much in the area but a supermarket is available opposite. Quiet night sleep and friendly locals.

110863,2451274,5,Patrisabelle,19/10/2022,"A super pitch with many free services such as wifi, water, electricity etc. It was very quiet at night. Too bad the shower heads and hoses have been partially hijacked. Many thanks to the municipality for this generous mobile home parking space!"

Share a photo of Max on Social Media stating #souselocatmax Greetings Jorn and Anita."
110863,2440193,5,HeKl,12/10/2022,"Great place with everything you need and this for free. A big thank you to the community. Too bad that not everyone knows how to deal with it and that shower heads and hoses are disappearing. Great bistro at the top of the park ""Sem Stress"" with a very friendly owner and an excellent hairdresser in the village. Spent a wonderful evening here. Access for CC from 7m might be difficult."
110863,2439523,5,Lesaintbernard,12/10/2022,"Magnificent area with a very nice view, a road passes by but nothing outrageous 8 places provided but if you squeeze there can be 10 if ever there is a normal parking lot lower free electricity trash services everything you need!"
110863,2435312,5,manrai,10/10/2022,"Nice and clean place. There is all you need to rest in a rainy day. Everything works, hot showers   ,  there is also supermarket 100m away.  Thanks to the municipality!"

110863,2396226,3,GERALDINEJF,23/09/2022,"The area is very good, there are all services including electricity, toilets, showers (unusable without pears), all very clean and free. There is a small supermarket next door with a bakery. Unfortunately, it is extremely noisy, late at night, until midnight, then from 6am, the incessant road traffic. To this must be added the crowing of a merry rooster from 4am."
110863,2385680,5,carpette2,19/09/2022,magnificent after the douro valley you rest in a magnificent area all services with electricity shower and toilet very very clean thank you to the Portuguese

110863,2383106,5,madcedpark,18/09/2022,"Great place for motorhomes, everything is available between shower, toilet, water, drainage, electricity, picnic area and playground nothing to say... We had the right to visit a little cat without doubt abandoned… Do not hesitate to leave him water and food he is adorable, cuddly and asks only to be loved. Thank you to the municipality for this beautiful development!"
110863,2379703,4,domnath,17/09/2022,Everything is free and clean The big problem complicated entry and exit You have to be an experienced pilot Not recommended for grand cabari that's why I put 4

110863,2335030,5,Lotus63,03/09/2022,"Beautiful motorhome with a beautiful view which is equipped with drinking water, 2 showers, 6 toilets, electricity, picnic tables, drain for gray and black water. Very unfortunate that vandals apparently need to steal the shower heads (so showering with only the hose) and demolish doors!"
110863,2330077,5,MarieBgt,01/09/2022,"Quiet and fully equipped motorhome area (shower, toilets, picnic table, water, electricity and playground for children). The place is clean and well exposed with a view of the mountains. Only disturbing point, the church which rings regularly in the evening and in the morning."
110863,2329648,5,formzuform,01/09/2022,"Absolute gem. Clean showers and toilets. free electricity. beautiful area. 
I can't believe it's free! wish these kind of places existed more often."
110863,2296098,4,eiro01,24/08/2022,"Great place, thanks to the community. But if the users, or at least the boys loitering around, make the showers unusable and destroy the doors, then that's a shame. Therefore a star deduction."
110863,2285976,5,coco0742,22/08/2022,"One of the best motorhome areas we have been to. Everything is available for free, thank you to the municipality for this development"
110863,2285486,5,taodagdag,22/08/2022,"Wc and shower correct some young people from the villages came on the air but the police made them leave. We spent a good night there. Besides, a super cute and friendly cat walks on the air if you see him, leave him some water! He is surely abandoned but seeks contact."

110863,2207206,5,Dreamers2019,10/08/2022,"very quiet place and the people are so nice! water, toilet, shower, electricity... are free!"
110863,2180103,1,johancindy,05/08/2022,"Very difficult to access. Armored area. Motorhomes do not respect all the pitches provided. Too much noise in the city (dogs howling all night, the road nearby). For those like us who seek calm, this place is to be avoided."
110863,2179921,5,SyFri,05/08/2022,Only shadow areas and a restaurant are missing ☺️
110863,2176300,5,RenatoFurmann,04/08/2022,"Free parking, water, energy and toilet, as a prize for those who manage to enter with their motor home. A real test of driver skill. On our visit, only 4 of the 8 power sources were working. Bathrooms were clean and common areas in excellent condition. silent."
110863,2158861,5,Nejt,01/08/2022,"We were able to spend one night here in our roof tent and would do it again and again. The showers and toilets are really very clean and well-kept - you should only think about toilet paper. It gets a bit busier from around 9am, which is perfectly fine."
110863,2157459,5,mandyverdam,01/08/2022,Great service place. Everything at hand and it costs nothing! The showers (2 in total) can be regulated from cold to really hot. You can get rid of your gray and black water and there is electricity for every parking space. Seems like a quiet place to spend the night. I have not done it myself because of the enormous heat and no shade options. The driveway was easy to do with my 6m camper van.
110863,2154072,5,AS095,31/07/2022,Very nice place! We were able to change our water tank here and enjoy a warm shower. The shower hose had no nozzle on it. The street cats were very pushy and kept trying to climb into our bus
110863,2146041,5,camilandessie,30/07/2022,"Perfect place! Very nice and clean. We stayed here for one night without any issues. The toilets and showers are very clean and practical. The only part the architect messed up is the entry. When turning from the main road down, you have to manoeuvre on a very steep hill to enter the parking. We did it with our campervan however some larger RV’s may have issue to fit or not scratch the bottom."
110863,2145240,5,park4nightrebew111,30/07/2022,"For the fact that the place is free, perfect. Plumbing, water, electricity, good views, little shade but good wind"
110863,2125823,5,awp,26/07/2022,"Great place - full service for campers, toilets, shower, playground. Shop nearby. V
Very clean place with amazing view!"
110863,2113695,5,Patrali,23/07/2022,"everything perfect. Everything is exactly as described by others. Instead of the 4 Womos, there would also be 2 more space, but since the large Womos had spread out all the chairs, tables and awnings very far, that wasn't possible. We stayed in the parking lot below - that's fine for one night. A very generous offer from this municipality"
110863,2047993,5,alixandrix,07/07/2022,"Amazing for one night! Even the view is beautiful! We were 3 for 8 places at the ""top"" (right next to the showers and the water). But there is also a parking lot at the bottom which can contain +/- 10 vehicles or even more :-)"
110863,2038890,5,ledivinchauve,05/07/2022,"Just perfect ! A free night which offers all the usual services for motorhomes, hot showers and toilets, a new place with games for children and lots of grass, in a pretty village well lit at night and not even 100m from a small supermarket. Yes access can be complicated for long vehicles but I managed it with mine of 7m by going slowly"
110863,2022914,5,waytboi,29/06/2022,"If you don't give 5 stars here, you grew up in a golden palace. Very clean and tidy, electricity, hot water, showers and toilets free of charge. In Germany, people are happy to pay 35 euros per night for this. And the driveway (I was a bit scared after some comments): easily accessible - only a challenge with huge mobile homes."
110863,1989344,4,timbarnard,18/06/2022,"This is a fantastic new place, but the access to it is a nightmare, what were they thinking!! We have a 7.5 m M/H and made it in with the help of a local, the access is to the right IMMEDIATELY you turn off the main road and the access is very narrow with servere slopes in two directions."
110863,1986769,5,Scudo_Home,17/06/2022,"The entrance can be difficult if you don't have skills or you come distracted.
I didn't have any problems cause me van is small but I saw two large CC arriving and leaving the park effortless.
However the free service area is beautiful calm and has clean toilets and showers."
110863,1975664,4,jma12,14/06/2022,"Very nice area, well equipped, with electricity and sanitary facilities. Noisy from 6 a.m. until 11 p.m. Sanitary facilities have been ransacked (shower hoses ripped out, doors ripped open) which discourages municipalities from developing suitable areas."
110863,1965327,1,JeanPierregriffol,10/06/2022,"sanitary equipment broken and dirty, the young people of the village squat late in the place and the road passes just above. No maintenance on the entire area What a waste !!!"
110863,1954436,5,Abenteuerwind,06/06/2022,"We absolutely cannot understand some reviews. A top pitch, with electricity, a great view, FREE WiFi and a warm and clean shower and all for free! Yes, the driveway is steep and a bit narrow, but it can be done in a relaxed manner, nothing will tip over. You should bring your own shower head as those in the showers are gone. Thanks to the community something like this is very rare!"
110863,1936454,5,Travelaar,01/06/2022,"Top place with all amenities and everything for free. Showers and toilets were cleaned early in the morning. Quite steep slope to leave the place again, but it is doable."
110863,1902587,5,thierry29780,20/05/2022,"Unheard of in 12 years of motorhome use. The equipment is top notch, clean and all of this is available to us free of charge. Many thanks to the municipality of Souselo. Obrigado."
110863,1902355,5,geclo,20/05/2022,if we had been able we would have added more stars... mini flat on the users who tore off a shower hose... that condemns a space! Thank you Thank you to the municipality of souselo
110863,1889798,1,Tucanoo,14/05/2022,"You must need adaptors, the same that you use outside of PORTUGAL"
110863,1883869,5,aha76,11/05/2022,"The place in and of itself is great. The access road is really really steep, as others have already mentioned... The 8 pitches are huge and everyone spreads out as extensively as possible with an awning and table and chair, it's free... It's a shame, otherwise there would easily be room for more vehicles! Luckily there is a normal car parking lot just below, which we used overnight."
110863,1882539,4,catetphiphi50,11/05/2022,thank you to the municipality for making this free area available on the road to the Douro Valley with all the free services but beware access is very complicated because the entrance is immediately downhill so beware of long CCs because the same goes for the exit and if you miss the entrance difficult to go back there
110863,1865075,1,hponwheels,02/05/2022,"I give 1 star for the entrance, if you have a high AC like ours (3.50) it is possible to overturn the entrance, it is too steep, they could already pour a little cement and level the entrance, after almost overturning the AC we we turn around and give up trying to enter. (At least our AC that has reinforced suspension and leaf springs) with a short one maybe not that feeling."
110863,1853007,3,Catarella,25/04/2022,"At the driveway you have to turn 2 X in quick succession at a 45° angle with very narrow access roads. The driveway is very steep - about 10%, and is made more difficult by high curbs. When I was there, the electricity didn't work on either column. The view of the valley is severely limited by vegetation and buildings. The plots are pleasantly wide. The nearby road is clearly audible."
110863,1851309,5,marianocaravana,24/04/2022,spectacular area with all services nice and quiet. includes Wi-Fi. a great detail of the place.
110863,1851182,1,sun1,24/04/2022,"I have given 1 star, because it was my fault, I’m 9 meters long could not get over the curbs to the air so I went down the road to turn around and then had problems with that."
110863,1846902,5,digitaline_june,22/04/2022,"Brilliant, we loved it. The view is beautiful, the village peaceful. The toilets are clean, and there is even the possibility of taking a hot shower. We highly recommend this place!"
110863,1841321,3,Masmoudi,20/04/2022,"Relaxed pitch with water and toilet. The showers are unfortunately broken (shower heads removed). I can only confirm that with the steep, narrow driveway and we didn't have any electricity either. There is also a supermarket about 50 m away, which has more than it seems from the outside. There is also bread there."
110863,1838135,3,J-N.B,19/04/2022,the presentation is a little optimistic .... nice place only but it has the merit of existing so thank you to the municipality ATTENTION extremely delicate entrance with an 8m like I have and everything is planned for small vehicles (drainage of gray water ) etc.... For those over 7.5 it is wiser to choose another place
110863,1820734,3,FerdiVan21,14/04/2022,"A very lively place to stay. We had the feeling that the whole village came to visit. We wouldn't stay there at the weekend. The electricity didn't work. The driveway is quite steep and a narrow driveway. But it has a hot shower, which is clean."
110863,1816682,2,thecki,12/04/2022,"Even if everything is free, but this place is an absolute bad design. Disposal is hardly possible due to the cramped conditions. The journey is more than adventurous for campers over 6 m in length. Maneuvering when full is not possible."
110863,1803240,5,NezaRoblek,01/04/2022,"Free hot shower, clean toilets, and great atmosphere! Felt safe as a solo female traveler."

110863,1799163,5,Joebarteam69,28/03/2022,"Very good, even too good because the pitches are taken by storm… no more space from 4 p.m. There is room to put additional vans or CC's if people park properly. However, no electricity for everyone, only 8 possible connections. As a result, we had to do without… clean showers and toilets, I recommend +++"
110863,1798163,5,Noomz,27/03/2022,"amazing facility. on top of offering grey and dark water disposal, there's free electricity at each of the 8 carpark spaces. women's disabled toilet/shower had missing rods in the door, so would need a towel to cover and protect privacy. free WiFi. close to a GT cycling route. full carpark on Friday night (25/03) and additional campers using below carpark (for cars only) on Saturday night (26/03)"
110863,1779177,5,VidasNomades,10/03/2022,"location with amazing view, with all the perfect services free of charge. there is a market nearby. worth a visit!"

110863,1773574,5,Bichezas,04/03/2022,"Thanks to the City Council for the Infrastructure, one of the best I know in the country! The site only accommodates eight motorhomes, with all the most demanding requirements satisfied, users need to be more careful in the use of the facilities as I have already noticed some damages caused."

110863,1758177,5,reisande,17/02/2022,"still 5 stars, too bad that also here fashion campers are all free, so exploit, electric heating and take what is loose, 48 hours is no hibernation !!"
110863,1755127,3,Jan806,13/02/2022,"Even if the place offers a lot, the last part of the approach is extremely steep and offers no turning possibility. The best thing to do is to stop somewhere in front of it and see if there is still space available."
110863,1754988,5,chipeau3,13/02/2022,"it's perfect, but it has already been vandalized (shower doors and missing hand shower) for this and for maintenance I suggest that the municipality charge a minimum fee of 7 €. this would be normal for the services offered, if you want to continue to enjoy such a stopover."
110863,1754674,5,vitorhugomus,13/02/2022,Great. All services free… very peaceful night… space for children…

110863,1734502,3,MissSchwertfisch,15/01/2022,"I found it noisy due to the street and too crowded with six camper vans then standing tightly packed. In addition, in winter the sun disappears behind the mountain at around 2:30 p.m. and it gets cold. I drove on."
110863,1730551,5,PauloMendes,09/01/2022,"Excellent public ASA and totally free fantastic and breathtaking view. Congratulations to CM Cinfães and its promoters, they must promote adequate maintenance in order to maintain the degree of excellence. It's a shame that there are people who frequent that space and commit acts of pure vandalism, but what about the society that we are letting evolve... I recommend *****."

110863,1697250,5,Pauer,24/11/2021,"Super nice place with everyone and more what your heart desires. It's just a shame that vandals are dismantling or destroying facilities. For example, steal shower sets!"
110863,1695410,5,fammol,22/11/2021,"Great place! But indeed, that entrance is dangerously steep. Showers are easy to arrange (at least the one we used). Very nice that such a place is offered!"

110863,1682137,4,povilas393,08/11/2021,Be aware that it is not really suitable for large motorhomes. Especially if you have lower profile camper it might be difficult to enter and leave. Otherwise pretty good spot with free service including electricity.

The only thing less positive is the entrance for being on a hill but it is not too complicated to enter. We have spent one night and without any problem. Better than many camping sites. Thank you very much to the people, with areas like you are, they are worth continuing to travel in AC."

110863,1432658,3,jfer,10/08/2021,"Very well appointed area but; Only 8 locations (wide) and obviously a lot of suction cups. At the edge of the busy road. Entrance and exit on slopes very dangerous especially for large CC as indicated in other comments. View: blah blah ...: noisy quarry, banal or ruined pavilions scattered loose on the sides of the surrounding hills. Rather depressing ..."

cute little places for walks too."
110863,1355648,4,alloalli,23/07/2021,"Nice place, with good facilities, especially for one night. Just a pity that the parking lot is just not level, so this time we sleep with our head at the foot end."
110863,1351647,5,JamieJane,22/07/2021,Beautiful parking space from the community. Really everything you need and free of charge. Annoying young people who ruthlessly spend their evening here with loud music but at 12 noon everyone was gone & it was quiet. Absolutely to be recommended!
110863,1340463,5,warkov,19/07/2021,"Very clean area with free everything, rare and very well thought out service .. the young people of the village actually spend their evening there but without major excess for the 2 nights we spent there!"

110863,1325045,5,gambiermatthieu,14/07/2021,"It is well worth its stars. Be careful though, not accessible to large (7m and) and large sizes, it will not pass, more the drain air will not be accessible either. For the others everything is said ... precision anyway, the bell that starts at 7am, the young people who squat a little and the road with cars ... great classics ..."
110863,1321695,5,MartKlifman,13/07/2021,"Easiest 5 stars ever given. Should be 6 stars. 

A free parking place with:
- Really good wifi(!)
- Showers (cold, but again... it's free)
- Toilets
- Picknick tables
- Nice view
- Even the drive to this place is beautiful along the river 
- Supermarket nearby. 

On a saturdaynight in july only 3 spots were taken from the 8. 

Few teenagers hanging around in the weekend, but they did not disturb."

We got 8m with a bike rack and it worked. BUT the driveway is off a small, very steep road. In, if you don't drive past (like many ...), go out, up the hill and straight onto the main road, should be a challenge for many ... very narrow, very steep"

110863,1248606,4,Anikanski,11/06/2021,"Great view, all facilities for free. Water in the shower was not hot, but we didnt need since it was hot outside. The showers and toilets were totally fine. Not in the shape of a 4 star hotel, but fine! Don't know what some people here expect from a spot thats completely free of charge. thanks a lot to the community!!!"
110863,1238681,1,DonAlberto,06/06/2021,"Actually a super nice place and a great offer from the community. Unfortunately, there are young people hanging around here until late at night who are extremely loud. As a result, toilets are also in a miserable condition. We didn't want to take a shower here. What a shame!"

110863,1120319,5,LouisM,09/12/2020,"An area like every van lifer dreams of! Free and quality services, a magnificent view and Christmas lights to light up the night. On the other hand, pay close attention to the slope to access it, which is difficult to go up."
110863,1114788,1,verliebte_aussteiger,13/11/2020,"Actually a very nice place that would have deserved 5 *. However, because of the WLAN, the young people hang out here and destroy them, polluting the entire sanitary facilities. Only the handicapped shower works, but be careful, the sink will soon fall down. In the night / early morning the caravan haters come with loud music. The church should act urgently."
110863,1114013,5,boris.dinko,10/11/2020,Perfect place. All services and quiet. Free
110863,1106475,5,newhome_newadventure,26/10/2020,"Top site. You have here everything grey and black water, drinking water, Electricity, WC, and Hot shower and it's all free. 8 places, plus parking lot one level lower for 20 cars.

110863,1050979,5,Merijn85,15/09/2020,"A really nice, neat spot for approx. 6 or 7 vans/campers. All services, incl. electricity are available for free. Nice view and very quiet in the night. 7,5 - 8 meters is kind of the maximum to make the turn."

110863,1006478,5,DorienVdeb,27/08/2020,Superb place to spend the night! The facilities are really good. Children have access to a safe playground. Also nice for jogging or some sports exercises. I highly recommend the spot !!!
110863,985771,4,Antoniopereira,20/08/2020,"I have a 7.40 I entered without problem with a little attention,"
110863,973394,1,Fitzroy,17/08/2020,"We have just had a terrible experience. The access road is very steep and a 90 degree turn, we almost turned around and had to go downhill. impossible to turn around, our brakes overheated and we were immobilized."
110863,949214,5,hymer4family,11/08/2020,"Service area for motorhomes with all conditions (electricity, water, wc, place for dumping dirty water and wc) and 100% free, it has 8 spaces with plenty of space.  Next to it has a playground, physical activity park.  The only negative point may be the noise of children and young people in the park until later.  Pay attention to the entrance and exit of the motorhome area, as it is slightly tilted laterally."
110863,935804,5,fredfeiert,07/08/2020,Really great place to stay and do some of the hikes in the local area. The toilets / showers are great. The approach is a bit steep and narrow.
110863,885449,4,060859,21/07/2020,Quite complicated entrance nice location thank you the city for this place
110863,853108,5,hwneumann,07/07/2020,"Excellent! Everything is there that the camper heart desires, including electricity and fantastic showers. Only the entrance is quite steep (the whole thing is built on a slope), maybe inspect it before the entrance. But should ultimately be possible for everyone."
110863,848996,5,Sonja-dw,04/07/2020,"Nice place to spend the night with the camper. there is an opportunity to shower, use the toilet and the supermarket is around the corner! There is also the possibility to use power, but it requires a CEE plug (which is not for sale in the adjacent shop)."
110863,825626,4,benizeli,15/06/2020,Good place to stay overnight. quiet and close to supermarket. free electricity and bathrooms with cold showers
110863,822287,5,FsPena,12/06/2020,"Excellent location. Unfortunately the showers have already been vandalized, but all other services continue to work well. The big problem is the access, as already said here, the entrance is really for ""brave""."
110863,793296,5,Gillian1973,09/03/2020,"Brilliant camperstop with all the amenities, thank you Souselo :) bigger motorhomes - be warned it is a very steep entrance road and off turn into the parking area. We were holding our breath doing it in and out (7.6m)"
110863,791644,5,otso,06/03/2020,"Superb motorhome area with all shower and toilet services, daily cleaning Plus electricity for each pitch all free. Many thanks to the municipality"
110863,788591,3,Kalamunda,29/02/2020,"Brilliant site complete with a shower block! All virtually new and spotless.
Only reason for just 3 stars is free electricity encourages too many too stay way too long and block off spaces for those who are passing through whose then only option is to use the overflow car park situated a little lower down the hill. Just as nice but less convenient for the showers and no electricity."
110863,787186,4,Andjoc,26/02/2020,I put 4 Stars because it is necessary to encourage the initiatives of the municipalities and in addition it is free. the star less is our hassle despite its 170hp our 7ml with its short trailer (with scooter and bikes) so as not to interfere we wanted to take the 2nd parking lot and in reverse. Fortunately a resident helped us with his vehicle otherwise we stayed planted below. so before you commit think that it will be necessary to come out. On the other hand it is in the lower part 1 parking lot for the inhabitants so sometimes late return 2 or 3 am and departure to work around 6 am
110863,786865,4,joselui,26/02/2020,Good place to stay but not perfect. All services for free but a road beside make it a bit noisy.
110863,783624,5,Sharlynn,20/02/2020,"I agree with the other comments, wonderful motorhome area. All free services including electricity !!! Magnificent view of the Douro valley as well as lots of tourist information (hiking, culture, nature ...). A very big thank you to the municipality for this rare generosity. PS: We have an 8m motorhome and we came in and parked without any worries."
110863,783490,5,Maggiethegreenvan,20/02/2020,"I had read the reviews and was all excited to get here, it did not disappoint! Beautiful views, lots of space for big campers but I agree about the entrance being tricky. I watched a 7m van turn in, with a few manoeuvres it made it. If you take it slow, it's really okay! Elec is 3 pin standard Euro plug, I bought an adaptor but didn't need it! 2 toilets for men and 2 for women, one shower each in the disabled toilet. Lower car park for bigger vans available and plenty of picnic tables for enjoying the view. I'm so happy with this area it's definitely the best I've sen so far! Big thanks to the town of Souselo for this!"
110863,782563,5,Pilote691,18/02/2020,"Simply magnificent, thank you to the municipality."
110863,778491,5,Bilas,10/02/2020,"Very good. All free services including electricity and hot water spas. The entrance is a little complicated but nothing that is not done. Motorhomes over 7m do not fit, they are in the lower area."
110863,776038,3,wellcome,04/02/2020,"During the week, young people from the surrounding area, the nights are hellish, door noises, loud music, loud voices not to sleep from 1 hour until 3 am and for young people without traffic the noise and from 6 pm to 10 pm non-vehicles that there I still accept since it is allowed until a certain hour after a long day of walking and others, we do not deserve respect"
110863,774198,5,dij260,30/01/2020,Fantastic facilities in a beautiful region of Portugal. All open even in January. Entrance is a bit sketchy and nothing over 7 meters will fit in the dedicated bays. Room for 8 with free EHU and hot showers! Come on UK sort it out!!!!
110863,773672,5,Sandra1903,28/01/2020,"WiFi, shower, water, electricity and disposal available for free. This is really a great offer. In addition, the place is clean and well maintained. There is a playground and sports equipment next door. It was very quiet at night. The access is quite steep but not a big problem"
110863,772895,5,Cuchufleta,26/01/2020,"A perfect area, quiet, modern, clean and completely prepared and all free! Connection to electricity. Wc with hot showers. Emptying and filling. Drinking water. Night lighting. Park for puppies and children. Thank you very much to the municipality of Souselo for having these magnificent facilities for AC. And camper. Congratulations!!!!"

110863,771158,5,Pascal84,21/01/2020,What to add to the previous comments ... Magnificent !!! And with wifi in addition !!! Our poor France should take example ... Nani & Pascal from 84
110863,769299,4,VollzeitVanlife,16/01/2020,"We have been here for a few days now and have so far not found anything comparable. Free toilet, shower and electricity. There is also a supermarket with cheap prices just around the corner. The people here are very nice and you feel comfortable ... BUT ... the students in the afternoon and teenagers in the evening and into the night unfortunately make this place unattractive and many things break."
110863,753830,5,gedec,15/12/2019,"All is said. I have been a camper van operator for 8 years and I have traveled across Europe and this is the most beautiful area I have ever seen. It is true that the maneuvers are a bit tricky but if you know how long it takes to drive, it will pass. Given the slope of the surrounding places, there is frankly nothing flat and it is a small miracle that the town is made an area at this location."
110863,752670,1,Lucil,11/12/2019,"Air camper nice but pity that the students find no other occupation than to come to clog the toilet, sink and let their garbage everywhere for there are garbage everywhere"
110863,745824,5,Letach,22/11/2019,"Very good location, very clean with all services. Only downside pitches are slightly sloping, for comfort think to take hold."
110863,739857,5,Wald3mar,07/11/2019,"Awesome place. Good wifi, toilets and shower. Best free place I've ever been to."
110863,724208,5,michelguihal,18/10/2019,What to say ? Everything has been said previously Other thanking the municipality for an area like it would be good everywhere ok sloping access but when we have his license it even happens when arriving at night with a Cc 8m
110863,724186,5,Bulli_Camper,18/10/2019,"Very nice, new parking space. Showers (warm!) And toilets are clean. Great view of the surrounding area. Recommended!"
110863,723991,5,adria17,17/10/2019,"Better it would be too good! Everything is clean, nickel, free and the view is beautiful and the people friendly. What more can be said? A big thank you to the municipality."
110863,719741,5,jboul22,12/10/2019,Hard to do better. Everything is free: electricity water hot shower toilets picnic tables lit at night. Superb view and near shops. Never seen that. Thank you to this municipality. To respect.
110863,719459,5,jeffroscol,12/10/2019,"You can not find better in terms of layout, very clean, nice view, close trade. A welcoming municipality for campers to us to take care because it is increasingly rare, access is a bit tricky but it passes. Congratulations on this great initiative."
110863,719330,5,Relax2000,12/10/2019,"A really nice parking space, toilet, hot shower, water, electricity, gray and black water disposal everything there and free. You can only recommend!"
110863,718618,5,anjocores,11/10/2019,Space 5 *. Too bad access is not easy for vehicles over 7 meters. Electricity and free hot shower. Supermarket and cafe next door and ES Repsol. In the morning at the bend a van sells fresh fish. A pleasant walk to the Douro River entering the Rural Tourism access. Very good.
110863,713623,5,padraigl,05/10/2019,"This is a really nice new and clean Aire under the main road. There are 4 pitches each side of the sanitary block. The first 4 have more room to manoeuvre. It's part of a new park in the town. It really is a 5 star site.

Pros:
Free parking.
Free services.
Free electricity.
Free fast WiFi.
Free hot powerful showers.
Free toilets.
Picnic benches.
Touch screen information.
Outdoor gym.
Stunning views.
Local supermarket, cafe and bar.

Cons:
Difficult entry and exit.
Service bay difficult to manoeuvre into/out.
Roads not suitable for leisure cyclists.
There is no shade. 

There are full free services including electricity. 
The services are beside the toilets/shower block and are very difficult to manoeuvre into/out for motorhomes longer that 6m. I watched many long vans really struggle and have to drive on the flower bed and empty at an angle.

The grey waste is a normal ground drain with good direction.

The black WC drain is 100mm off the ground under a large stainless steel cover. The drain is good and deep with no splashback. There are 2 taps, one with a yellow hose connected with a 3/4 turn handle and the other a push button tap.

The fresh water tap pillar is on the other side away from the black WC drain, again with 2 taps. A long yellow hose connected to the screw-on tap with a 3/4 turn handle and the other a push button tap that is not screw-on.

There are small bins in the park and recycling bins at the supermarket.

The medium sized supermarket, cafe and bar are across the main road. There is a pharmacy further down the road with no footpath, so the walk is a little hairy. The river is a 25 minute walk down the hill passing vineyards where you can purchase local wines.

We had a quiet night after the group of young loud girls went home about 11. They hang out around the sanitary block. Also two cars with young adults and loud music were in the lower carpark for about 20 minutes. 
There is some road noise and a local church bell but that did not bother us.

The sanitary block containing clean toilets and showers is in the middle of the Aire. The showers have plenty of hot water and are powerful. The toilets are clean but there is no soap in the dispenser.

Bugs/Mosquitoes. (They love us..)
We did not encounter any mosquitoes here."
110863,711949,5,craigsteph1962,03/10/2019,"Faultless. All new facilities including spotless (hot) showers, electricity, water (fresh, grey and black) and a lovely view of the Duoro valley. All free! Quite amazing and a credit to local council. only 8 places as far as I can see so get here early (although if full you could park in normal car park below and use showers etc but without access to electricity)."
110863,704561,5,lanmare,25/09/2019,Nothing more is perfect.
110863,701158,5,mariepaule26,22/09/2019,Amazing this beautiful area and free electricity. Portugal amazed me every day for its welcome of cars but it's great. the descent is not difficult.no worries with a car of 7m
110863,699421,1,SyFri,21/09/2019,"Absolutely small, close access!"

110863,696720,5,trinfrance,19/09/2019,"Well if I could award 10 stars I would. This has been the best, and tidiest stop so far. Beautiful views, electricity, toilets and hot showers. Please do not use and abuse this site as the commune has spent a lot of time and money investing for us campers...... Enjoy your days here and leave as you find."
110863,684244,5,danisa79,10/09/2019,Super amazing and free
110863,676701,5,jackez54,04/09/2019,It is extraordinary that the municipality of Souselo puts at the disposal of motorhomes such a place. A big thank you to her. It's up to us to keep it in this state of cleanliness. An example to take in France.
110863,664034,5,Capcoast64121,28/08/2019,"Comfort with all services. Access requires attention because of the slope, the width of the lane and the height of the sidewalks"
110863,646244,5,Amm3,20/08/2019,Showers and toilets extremely clean! Very pleasant !
110863,641421,5,Xaver90,18/08/2019,"Super clean sanitary facilities, nice view, supermarket 3min walk, electricity / water all for free what more could you ask for"

110863,616757,5,malibert,10/08/2019,"Great place, very clean, only the shadow is missing. The showers are a dream. Too bad that you can not do much interesting in the vicinity and there is no access to the river."
110863,612304,1,Enjee,09/08/2019,"I would have 5 stars if I could access it. Unfortunately impossible, heavy vehicles of 8m on 3m60 uneven access too important and in addition leans right left. Risk of overturning. We parked behind the church to take a shower .."
110863,611850,5,CCjojo,09/08/2019,Perfect ! on the other hand electricity is cut during the night! access a bit sporty ... reduced space for maneuvers the caravan of the French is still there ... deplorable!

110863,554684,5,LRcompetition,15/07/2019,"Perfect, all free and clean. Top. Too bad that French people took the air of CC for a free camping by installing their caravan WITH the awning. In 3 days I did not see the car or the parents, only the teenagers are there. Disrespectful and lamentable !!!"
110863,530912,5,Pastriz,27/06/2019,"The entrance to the parking is a bit complicated since it has slope but it is the best area of motorhomes that we have known with all the services ""light, water, said etc etc"" ..... Many Congratulations to those responsible ....."
110863,530649,5,ademortier,27/06/2019,"What more, everything is there: hot showers, electricity, toilets, internet, shops and games nearby. Thank you commune."

110863,491057,5,Gredig,23/05/2019,"This site is a success, bravo the town. Water, WC, hot shower, playground for children and adults. Nice view of the Douro. One downside electricity is 6 amps, impossible to connect. To modify."
110863,487478,5,bealce,19/05/2019,"Very good area, with clean bathrooms and showers, electricity, although the side that we put did not work, good place to empty and water filling hose. It has a park nearby, to go with children I think it is an area 10"

110863,479416,5,MLav,08/05/2019,"Really a great area, still not recommended for motorhomes of more than 7.50 m. Ours is 7.5m and we had to maneuver for the drain. Brand new with showers and toilets. The electricity is free but limited, disconnects after about 4 hours. A big thank you to the municipality."
110863,479289,4,Marengo,08/05/2019,Clean toilets and even showers. A supermarket closeby. Perfect for one night. Be careful: the road in is a very steep and a bit tricky!
110863,478088,4,richard14840,07/05/2019,Area of exceptional quality integrated into the urban park with sports facilities.
110863,473458,5,ChrisDan07,02/05/2019,I confirm everything that has been said. Thank you very much to the city for this benefit. I add that there is also a mercado next door and a gas station (a bit expensive) with gas bottle
110863,472909,5,stokespandj,01/05/2019,"Superb, clean & new facilities. Hot shower and free EHU! As well as std water & waste. Aire situated on a new park area with children’s area, gym and jogging track. Supermarket across road.  Little else to do in the area - we walked to river but it was a 7km round trip, there are also a couple of cafes/bars around. Still a 5/5 aire. Thank you to the municipality for providing such a facility."
110863,470585,5,Maudandjustin,28/04/2019,"Easily the best free camper park we’ve seen so far while traveling across Europe. It’s better than most paid campgrounds! Careful when entering the parking area, the hill is a doozy."
110863,469052,5,katy_vanlife,27/04/2019,"Nice quiet area, newly built with some building still going on, but nothing that disturbs rest. free hot, clean showers, free electricity hook up and clean toilets.

110863,449381,5,IrisRitzen,05/04/2019,"Fantastic place and good working facilities. Clean toilets. Power was partially cut off when we arrived, had to do with low season. Anyway, for a free place nothing to complain about! Supermarket with bakery at 50 meters."
110863,448672,5,mimiwily12,03/04/2019,Perfect.
110863,446978,4,daniel1301,31/03/2019,Beautiful realization of the town hall. Super clean area. Plus everything is free including electricity. A single fault access surely a little tricky for more than 6m. Many thanks to the town hall.
110863,438954,5,Weilauto,11/03/2019,"Very well maintained new place. Clean toilets, several drinking water connections and disposal. The sockets were unfortunately issued but there is a plug in the bathroom. Small nice place with nice open people. The supermarket across the street has everything you need. The baker is very cheap. Caution at the entrance. Very large vehicles could have problems. Great place! Thank you!"

110863,436710,5,petelmrg,05/03/2019,Absolutely superb facilities with convenient small supermarket almost opposite. Exercise facilities and children’s area close at hand. I would agree that anything over 7 metres will struggle with access.
110863,425205,4,Wakupfamily,28/01/2019,"Great place, motorhome area surrounded by mountains, playground, sports area, electricity and water free. Negative entry point of the car park in hill and narrow."
110863,423195,5,LordStretton2,18/01/2019,If staying here the water tap needs an adapter as our English fittings don’t fit! Across the road in the supermarket for €1.60 one can buy the adaptor shown in the picture. Whether it’s like this for all Portuguese sites I don’t know but always handy to have in our Moho armoury!
110863,423062,5,LordStretton2,17/01/2019,"Perfect! Plenty of places and 2 x four electric points for 8 motorhomes! Water, black and grey waste too. It looks like they have showers/loos but they are presently shut for the winter. Wonderful view at the back of the site over the town and surrounding hills. Entrance is very narrow and on a slope so approach with care!"
110865,3101471,1,viskonde,08/08/2023,"as a person that lives in the area :
this is not free anymore (the best is the area for 3 euros per day) and is a street where cars get broken into very often to steal what is inside (I had my van broken here and many things were stolen and also my normal car , even if there was nothing inside)

not recommended :)"
110865,1939334,1,kuhlegrit,02/06/2022,I got my car broken into!
110865,1836024,1,viskonde,18/04/2022,"is not free anymore (during the day)
is also a place where car glasses get broken frequently due to vandalism."

110865,595564,2,killelle,03/08/2019,We stayed only the day. Not feeling good for the night. Punctured rat. circulation. slope.
110865,535740,1,Turnschuh,02/07/2019,The pitches are just in the middle of a major construction site. Very noisy at the street and an elderly lady told us that she has often seen thefts and broken windows on campervans. So we decided not to stay here.
110865,480410,4,Simon1523,10/05/2019,We stayed here for one night without problems. Its a Little tilted and only for campervans up to 6 m length
110868,2869181,3,elcloudy,19/06/2023,A small place not too far out and ideal for one night. In the morning a lot of people with bicycles / cars. Water and rubbish bin available
110868,2604170,5,LuuuNA,09/03/2023,"cool parking lot on the outskirts of barcelona. it's in the local recreation area, has beautiful stone tables, a super cool, stylish fountain with fresh water. I'm going for a jog along the river tomorrow before we continue. thank you that there are such pretty places that you can find thanks to park4night!"
110868,2168744,1,ikerlee,03/08/2022,"It is not possible to enter with a vehicle, there is a chain barrier and neither can the shopping center next door, because the maximum ok is 2.5 m."
110868,1959215,2,sloworg,08/06/2022,"Unfortunately it's a dodgy area. I parked for a dog walk, hoping to walk for a couple of hours but the area was obviously busy with various 'deals' etc so we only stayed 20 mins. If you're into wetland birds and wild habitats then it's worth coming without any precious stuff in your vehicle because the rich biodiversity here is something quite special."
110868,1707003,2,Zombiotik,09/12/2021,"We stayed to sleep here from 11/28/21 to 12/4/21, the first 3 days we left the camper van on site for the day without any problem, on the 4th day a guy came prowling around, we preferred to move him for the day in the Carrefour parking lot next door and the same the next day. It's okay for the night, but the day is better to go to the Carrefour. Noisy night because road nearby"
110868,1706904,4,LastSeenAbroad,09/12/2021,"We stayed here for 1 night. Really quiet during the night. No problems. Good to run a generator, since it doesn’t disturb anyone. Broken glass on the parking lot, so I’m not sure if I would leave the van/motorhome here alone."
110868,1281003,1,woodyontour,27/06/2021,"On the holiday of st.john the baptist we were in the city and when we came back the popped out our back window and stole a wallet. They did this after we left and in broad daylight. These were people that knew what they were doing. Even though we took measures to prevent robbers. The police came did not care about it did bot help us putting the window back in and just said they had to leave and stood 10 meters further for 2 more hours. When we filed a report at the local police the day after we found out the police didn’t even put our call in the system, but they did ask all of our info just for show I guess. This happens a lot in Barcelona so please be warned. We will never come back to Barcelona with our van. The rest of Spain we had no trouble."
110868,1269246,3,jorjito,21/06/2021,"Some noise with the road next to it, but practical enough to be 15 minutes from the center of Barcelona"
110868,1184372,4,enriquelme,03/05/2021,"Area with tables for picnik, with shadows and flat paths next to the river to walk"
110868,1085972,5,kieranandalice,08/10/2020,Fantastic place for the night when visiting Barcelona; really quiet (road noise is tolerable) and only runners and cyclists going past. Highly recommend for a safe night.

110868,738313,5,Linasb,04/11/2019,"Quiet and safe place, where you can spend the night. It has a train, metro and bus station El Prat de Llobregat to visit Barcelona. It fulfills its mission."
110868,622298,5,mteles,12/08/2019,Quiet and safe! Close enough to public transportation. Great place to park and sleep too.
110868,606548,4,getbusgo,07/08/2019,"Can't complain. Safe - only saw joggers and cyclists and fairly quiet (apart from the dual carriageway next door!) Bus into Barcelona about 10 mins walk away, head under the underpass."
110868,580684,4,cusa,28/07/2019,"We have spent 2 nights (Friday and Saturday) very quiet, we had more camper next to us. Cars are heard a bit when passing as the road is behind but does not bother to have a good rest. From the early hours of the morning there is a large influx of people as they come for walks and sports. We recommend it, it is a good place !!! And for the dogs it is wonderful!"
110868,580537,5,uxtela,28/07/2019,Very accommodating and quiet. Good opportunity to stay in Barcelona.
110868,535273,3,tessthaine19,01/07/2019,Stopped here on a Saturday night before heading to Barcelona.  Location is great because it was only a 20 minute drive to the city. There is a lot of traffic noise as it is on a main road so if you are a light sleeper I would avoid. The tap was a great bonus to refil our supplies!
110868,477928,2,nothofagus,06/05/2019,"I do not recommend it for the night if you want to rest, there is a lot of truck traffic from very early in the morning."

110890,3243492,5,mchicoc,31/08/2023,"Of all the areas and campsites in the area, this is the one we liked the most. Clean, although the times for cleaning the toilets at 8 in the morning and 8 in the afternoon are not the most popular because you have to wait. First-class service, they even pick up your parcel. Pool ok, and the food menu is brief but of quality. Reasonable prices. The water taps are to be shared. pitches ok"

The price is not what is listed in the description, at least not in August, 30e Autoca and 2p with elect. One drawback for this reason I took away a star is that rats pass through the hedges at the bottom at night, I discussed this with the reception, let's hope they do something."

The camper pitches are reasonably spacious. Within 1 hour by train to Valencia! only points for improvement for us were: staff at the bar do not speak English and the sanitary facilities are very far away if you are at the back of the site."
110890,3063310,4,taxichris13,02/08/2023,"Very good area, spacious location. The swimming pool is the pleasant bar at the end of July but since Friday bcp too many people, the swimming pool is overloaded. Clio vehicle or scooter available for rental directly on the site ..... On the other hand the city of xeraco or even the city of Gandia bof really nothing to do and especially interesting…. The area is pleasant if you have a means of rental……. Also to review the cleanliness of the showers and toilets but I think it comes rather from the users"
110890,3010309,2,LobiPandi,23/07/2023,"The area is very quiet and with spacious plots. Do not expect a camping atmosphere because it is not the style, it does not have that ""life"", it is more to be calm. I give it three stars because after 9:30 p.m. you cannot enter with the motorhome and the bar also closes. From that hour everything is dark. The bathrooms are quite neglected."
110890,3007096,5,SandyTue,23/07/2023,"A spontaneous night with 6m van, we fell in love with this place immediately. Plots separated by hedges. palm trees on the square. Clean sanitary facilities.

110890,2953051,4,marpaufel,12/07/2023,"The area is very good. Everything very clean and organized, although it can always be improved. What I do not see well and is also illegal, is that they have placed a surveillance camera focusing on the pool. Then there is the area for emptying the poti at the entrance. Isn't it easier to put a wide tube so that all the poop falls out at once and not be visible on a grid?"
110890,2934139,5,Buspot,07/07/2023,"Perfect area with all services, everything very clean and with very good attention. Perhaps the price you already pay as a campsite, €35 for two nights, without electricity, 2 adults and 2 children. Recommended, we will repeat for sure."
110890,2929250,5,FamilleRossi,06/07/2023,"The best one so far, in our opinion. Our kids loved the pool, very safe place, really closed to the beach, 500m from the sea. absolutely recommemded !!@"
110890,2919344,4,camperandoforte,03/07/2023,"The area itself is modern and clean. Nice pool and restaurant/bar area. However, the price of 30 euros per night for a camper and two adults is too high in my opinion, especially considering that there isn't a thread of shade."
110890,2912180,5,btvam,01/07/2023,"Nothing to say for the employees, the locations. the bosses, the food. The swimming pool is very good. The showers and toilets are perfect and clean all the time. The beach next to 500 m. Small flat, the city is not great. Just a SPAR with high prices. I recommend this gem. It's like being in Morocco You can rent a Clio car and also scooters directly in the Super area"
110890,2906100,5,Crisynube,29/06/2023,"3rd time in a row that we go. It does not disappoint!! You have everything at your fingertips, beach 5 minutes walking, good restaurants nearby and in the same area a pool to take a dip. Quiet both day and night."

What a pity"

110890,2691886,2,Danielk1988,23/04/2023,The place is OK. But nothing more. The food in the restaurant is more or less ok. Actually too expensive for the price. Salad is more from the supermarket bag and the pizza may be homemade but is more like frozen food. Train station is 3.6km away. We would not come back

It has WiFi, electricity and water outlets in each plot. The bad: The plots that they call ""VIPs"" because they are ""supposed"" to be bigger average the same as a normal one. The aisles to maneuver with the motorhome are narrow for AC of 7.4m. We will be back"

When rinsing, it pulls a lot and the top-loading washing machines do not wash really clean for 35 minutes for 4 €. Nevertheless a nice place."

110890,2554634,5,GerardCorinneDupont,18/01/2023,"Just Perfect... better than an area it looks like a campsite... there is everything you need to be well... you have to remember to book, they have a site that works really well."
110890,2549151,4,l.tit_a,11/01/2023,Looks nice and clean. The sea at 500 m. Cons: unstable wifi. whether at reception or at the back of the campsite. We told the manager about it but for him it was our phone that was malfunctioning.
110890,2548139,3,mingu077,10/01/2023,"Positive: the parking area is very good; option with electricity and without electricity; swimming pool; restaurant; good service and water on the plot. Negative: emptying services outside the area, insufficient for so many people; little prepared chemical toilet; nauseating smell in the environment and they leave you locked in with the motorhome (even if they give you an emergency phone, they should not prevent free exit, if necessary)."
110890,2545153,5,CANB,07/01/2023,"It is very good, very well cared for. The only drawback is that the water for both the shower and the water does not come out very hot, I think that should be improved. The price for two people with electricity is €18 per day."
110890,2542942,5,EriRic,05/01/2023,"Thank you for the beautiful pitch, which is very well maintained. The sanitary facilities were also great, clean and with enough hot water. Pool, restaurant very nicely laid out. Personally, the only thing that bothered me was the barking of dogs in the vicinity in the evening and during the night."
110890,2542352,4,21121947,05/01/2023,"Beautiful well-kept place, nice staff, bar, bread service, everything clean. Places are divided with small bushes. Beach and savings shop within walking distance. Unfortunately no infrastructure!"

Small convenience store with fresh bread. Super market near the campsite. Very reasonable price for this season.

There is a bar, a restaurant and a swimming pool. Only downside the emptying of waste water and cassettes are outside the campsite. Otherwise great place."
110890,2526282,4,wassmer,22/12/2022,"the area is very clean, the toilets the bar the swimming pool the sinks the laundry room nothing to say. 4 stars because the pitches, although wide, are not always very long and as regards the emptying of gray water and black water, it is at the entrance to the area, which is far from practical for those who are on the other side. 20 € 50 with electricity. not sure i'll come back"
110890,2525980,5,daniel2903,21/12/2022,"Magnificent. Perfect welcome. Always available to help you. Swimming pool, bar, restaurant, small store. Beautiful pitches very well maintained. There is everything you need. To recommend without hesitation."
110890,2517379,2,jurbo1,09/12/2022,"A neatly furnished campsite, clean sanitary facilities. Nothing special and downright mediocre quality in the restaurant. Clearly used to earning it (too) easily. Store present minimalistic with rather high prices compared to their competitors."

110890,2500392,4,Polux64,19/11/2022,very good stopover for one night in November nothing to complain about but very empty seaside town and without interest apart from the beach but not at this time. Highly professional recommended
110890,2499449,2,Chcol89,18/11/2022,"Too bad we arrived at 7:25 p.m. and everything was closed. We had a lady who couldn't let us in. We were broken down, towed from Cullera to the Xeraco Motors Garage, champions who helped us out immediately but released us at 7:15 p.m.-"

The very friendly staff is smiling. Swimming pool with deckchairs. You can rent a scooter or a car there to visit the region. Thanks to Typhaine and Jean-Michel for this beautiful setting. We will come back with the greatest pleasure."

The pretty ocher cement of the pool area has just been redone. We speak French and the reception is welcoming. The places are separated by small well maintained hedges. A small downside: The sanitary part is on the restaurant side... We felt good there!"

110890,2457873,5,DecretamosFeria,23/10/2022,"The structure of the campsite is excellent. It is located 5 minutes walk from the beach. The pitches are gravel, the bathrooms clean, the facilities well designed and the staff very friendly. The only slight drawback would be that they don't put toilet paper in the bathroom. According to a notice this is due to some problem they had in the past."

With a tremendous downpour all the way, risking my skin to get there, I arrive at 8:03, they tell me that they close at 8:00 pm and that they do not accept me, having warned them. Out of politeness and respect for others, I won't say what I think of these people. They are not good people, they go about their business and do not care about others. nothing recommended."
110890,2434372,5,travlr,09/10/2022,"Very friendly small campsite for motorhomes. With the palm trees, the pool and the bar, you almost feel like you're in the South Seas. Very neat place with very clean showers and toilets. Restaurant offers simple but good food. Beach in walking distance (7 minutes)."
110890,2433703,4,oli.mr,09/10/2022,"We were in August 2022. The plots are a bit tight, at least the one we got. The pool is cool and the bar/restaurant too, which for an area is well equipped. Clean bathrooms. Something expensive at night, €30 2 people with electricity."

110890,2393165,5,diegomonastere,22/09/2022,"Hi there. We spent 15 days of pure relaxation at Xeraco Campers. Morning beach, afternoon pool. All the people who are at the service of the Motorhomes are great. The restaurant bar is run by super friendly and helpful French people, who say hello to their children. We were able to do a lot of cycling on Tavernes and Gandia. The beaches in the area are superb and the water is super good. Back in the Gers we are already thinking about next year. We don't have an area of this quality in France with such efficient staff and facilities. Let's not forget the swimming pool and scooter rental. The town of Xeraco at 200 meters with a small supermarket and some restaurants and shops."
110890,2390208,5,sprimio,21/09/2022,"Very quiet area on these dates, small pool perfect for taking a dip, very clean facilities, dogs are allowed, it is close to the beach, a perfect Camper Area to spend a few days in the area, we will return without a doubt.

Impressive pool with a bar next door. Nice place with its own water tap and green separation of the pitches. staff was friendly. Would have liked to have stayed longer. 25€ for a van without electricity and 2 people. Dryer 5€"

It has a bar that comes in handy and is an extra. The beach is a 10-minute walk away (it's not long but if it were closer it would be great). There is also a Spar nearby. The town is quiet for a couple of days, it is a good rest destination."

110890,2243518,5,solle2007,15/08/2022,nice clean and convenient area to get to the beach. very clean showers and toilets the only flaw is the drainage of the black ones for those who have the nautical one to advise against since there is a very small gray and it would get dirty everywhere. for the rest we were very well
110890,2242795,3,losMaju,15/08/2022,"The area is not bad, it is quiet and clean, a small but cool and well-kept pool, 35 euros without electricity, now comes the negative, the bad restaurant service, partly because of the service and its food, which for me has been the worst, little quantity and quality on the low side that does not correspond to its price, I am not a fine eater but this is already making fun of people."
110890,2236084,3,Peketoy,14/08/2022,Every day the areas are more expensive. €30 per night. It is almost the same price as a small/family campsite.
110890,2219943,4,viajero.,11/08/2022,We have motorhomes so we don't pay for everything! At this rate they will charge more than a hotel.

Pitches relatively large, top sanitary facilities like in a 4 star hotel, small pool, very nice staff assigns a place, only baguettes in the shop and food in the bar too expensive. Spar market about 400m away on the way to the great beach. But the place offers nothing, only holiday apartments from Spaniards and hardly any restaurants."

Close to the sea & Spar on foot, reachable by bike Gandia. Friendly staff. Baguettes in the morning a bit overpriced. Definitely recommend for a few nights."
110890,1880286,5,Alexandra.keller,09/05/2022,No height limit with the motorhome. Enough room to turn. Very nice and courteous owners! Small shop with the essentials including bread in the morning. A small bar with fine drinks and pizzas. Very clean sanitary facilities. Really a luxury place. Short walking distance to the beach. I highly recommend!

110890,1831773,4,L.I.,17/04/2022,"The place is very stylish, ideal for 6m campers. Partly also suitable for larger ships. Family friendly, clean sanitary facilities, nice pool. As a parking space, it deserves 5 stars, definitely one of the best. The only deduction is the location, because the place doesn't have much to offer."

The pool and bar area is nice, although I understand some comments that say the pool can be small (we had bad weather and in terms of occupancy the environment looked comfortable). We paid 13.5 per night per dog van without electricity (we were two because we liked the place). The bar is not bad."
110890,1810706,5,HectorHoose,08/04/2022,"An immaculate & beautiful motorhome/camper car only site! Big flat gravel pitches with hedging & palm trees & tap at the pitch. Security gated, with swimming pool, pool side bar & fabulous views. Small & welcoming with 93 pitches in total but so well laid out it feels much smaller. Short walk to shops & beach. All that for just €12 (outside of June-sept) for 2 people with no EHU (which is extra)"

110890,1768003,5,Oteroj,27/02/2022,"great area. Its cleanliness and good treatment stand out. At a time when the town is empty of tourism and the beach is lonely, it is surprising to see that the area is 95% occupied by European and national tourism. It has everything you need just 250m from the beach. Highly recommended."

This area is like good wine that gets better with age. Congratulations for the quality of the stay and the welcome, no offense to some grumpy one day who tarnish the almost perfection. Good luck to the staff!!!"
110890,1742948,4,Nachtrag,28/01/2022,Stayed here with a dog for one night! Friendly lady searched a bit for a solution as I needed electricity and I drive a 7m camper van. She found a though small place for me! Thanks very much!

The bar is top notch with affordable prices, the sanitary facilities in great condition. With all these services the price is justified."
110890,1731469,1,pac4,10/01/2022,"Disgusted !! We had spent the New Year 2019-20 in this place where we had enjoyed the magnificent facilities. So we decided to go back this year but after having reserved two places side by side and having received a confirmation, on our arrival very badly received they wanted to place us one opposite of the other. Request for reimbursement of the reservation and goodbye."

If you shower / rinse countercyclically, the water is hot, otherwise only tepid (in winter). Every now and then electricity and WiFi are gone, but not unusual for Spain. SP big enough to put a chair down on the table. Got a pizza on site, it was ok."

110890,1717869,1,cricri7941,28/12/2021,"Absolutely NOT recommended. I wanted to book by phone and a rude guy replied that: 1. he refused if less than 4 days 2. I had no choice of location 3. stays payable in advance 4. arrival before 6 p.m. In short, you just have the right to pay and to close it. Faced with so much friendliness and respect for the customer, I went to look elsewhere."

Beach village is dead in off season but Spar was open.

Beware guardia civil. Navi will tell you to take a left turn into Xeraco coming from north. Same for leaving the campsite. No left turn.  3 campers got fined eur 100.

Also beware some longstay campers."

110890,1705780,5,cc26,07/12/2021,I confirm all the previous comments. This area is very well maintained. The pitches are large and well demarcated. The sanitary facilities are impeccable and spotlessly clean. The owners are very attentive and very helpful. The restaurant's pinacolada is up to the standard. We will come back for sure.
110890,1700701,5,zeProfet,30/11/2021,Very nice stop. Clean and quiet. Very close to the beach and shops. The couple running the restaurant/ bar are adorable and very friendly. Clean showers and toilets.

110890,1699756,5,antsinboots,28/11/2021,"Large camping. In november it was about 40% filled and we had plenty of room for ourselves and our dogs. The pitches are large enough and on gravel. Facilities very clean. Bathrooms not heated but hot showers. A café and bar on premise, a bit expensive. Overall really good value for money."
110890,1696542,5,ChristianSauvage,23/11/2021,"The welcome is super friendly and ... French. Great locations. Showers and toilets always nickel. Quality bar and catering. Clean and maintained area, a benchmark in our opinion. In this season oranges and mandarins at will for a few euros. Quiet, and possibility of going to Valencia or Gandia. We highly recommend. Thank you Jean-Michel and Tiphaine, in short to all the staff."
110890,1695695,5,FramboisePomme,22/11/2021,Very nice motorhome area with swimming pool and restaurant! Very warm welcome we went there twice and think of going back on our next visit. To visit Valencia station nearby.

At that time of year, Xeraco itself has one Spar shop and one tapa bar open. You can cycle peacefully between the naranja fields and a walk along the turbulent sea at 22° C is also not to be missed."

110890,1670049,1,Wafr,30/10/2021,"Friendly welcome, ok facilities but overpriced. There are better and cheaper in Spain like in Mazarron or San Janvier. Per day: € 12 for CC and 2 people, € 1.5 for the dog and € 5 for electricity. We pay in advance and we do not reimburse (the trap). I paid for 2 nights but after the disco music until 1:40 am, I didn't want to spend a second sleepless night and left. To forget."
110890,1670041,2,VoyageursJP59,30/10/2021,"Disappointed reality compared to the photos. My site for 3 days: 5 mx 6.5 the campsite had its nose 80 cm from the back of the motorhome in front ... no sun because of the motorhomes too close. Deserted corner in the middle of nothing except a Spar. Nice frozen pool. Cold showers in the evening. Finally the value for money is very bad, you can find much better in the region."
110890,1669894,1,gamounet,30/10/2021,"The reception is very correct but it is only a parking lot which in my eyes looks like a park like the others. In addition, we choose the location for you and we accompany you there to be sure that you do not go to another location! I did not stay on this site."

Either on a short way to the beach or by bike on a bike path to Platja de Gandía and further on the 3 km long beach promenade on a bike path to the port. The beautiful old town of Gandía can also be easily reached by bike. There is a new, large Masymas supermarket in nearby Xeraco."

Two points for improvement: the empty point for the toilet on the campsite smells gigantic! In addition, the allocation of the places on the without power field is illogical: campers are put together while there is plenty of space in the back!"

Emptying outside the area. If you come for 1 or 2 days you will be parked at the end of the area. We find better for 17 euros."

Don’t understand why charge for dog as no facilities such as fog walking area or showers. Have to go outside of park. Would recommend park.

We have come for one night because we are passing through but, if we had known, we would not it would have been important to have another. I can say little more. I recommend it 100%."
110890,1577911,2,denpar3465,14/09/2021,Tight access in places but reasonable size pitches. Lovely little pool. 5 mins walk to beach. Shower in the evening was cold. Unfortunately nowhere in the beach area was open when we visited. Charge was 17 euros per night plus 1.50 per dog. Not cheap for an aire. But reasonable facilities.

110890,1563773,5,BlueCampAranda,10/09/2021,"An example of an area, clean and correct, spacious spaces, with a small but very beautiful pool. Extensive services and showers, washer and dryer service. Bar, restaurant and small shop. To put a but, it is the lack of shade that will be solved when the trees grow, and the closing hours for vehicles, greatly limits your mobility but gives security and tranquility."
110890,1560014,5,langeoleur,08/09/2021,All the comments are correct great air swimming pool and shower toilet malaver everything is nickel the price is 17 euro with electricity for two. I am seriously thinking of opening a reception area like the one in France

110890,1549576,5,alpepanoda,05/09/2021,"Highly recommended place, with an incredible pool and only 5 minutes from the beach. For € 5 they let you leave the pitch in the afternoon. And if you don't have one, they'll rent you even the motorcycle for € 20 all day. Why aren't there more areas like this?"

Lena and Raul are very friendly. Thanks for everything from parcel 82, ;-)."
110890,1543290,5,Puytri,03/09/2021,It is just perfect. The area that every motorhomeist would ask for. You can open an awning on the pitches that have water and electricity. The swimming pool is appreciated and in the bar you can eat a great rice (the baked rice is especially recommended) The beach and the town are 5 minutes away by a sidewalk without danger. The only downside is that we are not close enough to come more. A 10!
110890,1526671,4,rpenyarroja,29/08/2021,They are all new facilities and the pool is appreciated.

110890,1459570,5,Kuifje,15/08/2021,"As described. Friendly and attentive owners. high price justified. Very calm except when a tribe of Spaniards arrives at 10 but the boss quickly solves the nuisance. The only downside is that the dog owners take their doggies out into the private lane next door and fail to collect the droppings, which irritates the owner of the lane. We will return."

Unfortunately there is no toilet paper, as certain guests were probably doing mischief with it. It has a great pool that is perfect for cooling off. However, only about waist-deep, so also ideal for with children. The holiday feeling under the palm trees was so great that we extended one night."

At around 6 o'clock in the morning you are rudely awakened by the motor-driven water pump of the adjacent plantation. The place itself offers nothing from a few restaurants, and Paseo Marítimo does not exist either. Encouraged by the previous descriptions, we are now a little disappointed."

I will go back as soon as possible.

We had ordered meat for our dogs, the delivery man did not deliver to us on the scheduled day, saying that he had not found the address and could not contact me because I have a French number. The reception team didn't hesitate to help me contact the delivery company and reschedule an appointment, really thank you all. The only negative we had was the seafood paella we ordered. Disappointed because for 2 there were only 2 mussels, 4 shrimps and the rest of the rice with squid and in addition super salty."

Pool not cleaned properly. On the other hand, the prices of tokens for washing machines have increased, from € 2.50 to € 4 this year I find that excessive.

110890,891914,4,fifi44,23/07/2020,"Very nice area perfectly fitted out. Friendly pool. village and beach close. The problem for me is the asking price far above similar areas in the area. Here for a plot of 50-60m2 maximum for a vehicle of 9 to 10m with 16amp electricity the price is 35 € for 2 people. If you have 2 more children it is 10 € more or 45 € per night when there is no particular service. The restaurant is closed, no bread deposit. Just the swimming pool and very well done sanitary facilities. At 30-35 € per night I would have put 5 * but it is still very expensive whereas in winter for the same thing the prices go down by 50%. Why charge a lot when there is very little traffic we were 5 or 6 cc max. Surprising pricing policy."

110890,793773,5,ericanny,10/03/2020,"The previous one is a great liar, the price for dogs is 1 € 50 and not 10 € 50 the showers are never closed even at night, and all the shops are open but you have to want to move, and opposite from the campsite there is a vacant lot where dogs can go. me I find xeraco campers one of the mayyeurs place for us a pity that there are too many dogs which are rooms"

110890,786809,4,JAC975,26/02/2020,"To say, as Xeraco campers says, that the price is € 13.5 from Sep. to Jun. Is misleading. The price is € 17 per day with electricity and can be lowered according to the length of the stay. The area is good and clean."
110890,784569,4,Cecilehb,22/02/2020,"Cleanliness, friendly welcome, services included for 17 € with electricity ... Good for a break on the road!"
110890,783867,3,jonkil,21/02/2020,"Expensive for what is on offer. Pitches are tight to access with larger motorhomes, at 7.5m we found it tight. Not enough dish washing sinks (3 for 100+ pitches) and no hand wash laundry sinks. Cassette emptying & grey water outside campsite gate. The town is reminiscent of a 1960’s Moscow tenament buildings with little character or anything to offer. OK for one night en-route but not for us."

It is true that you have to walk 5 minutes to the beach but the beach is worth it to be with children because you have to go deep to cover it. We will return for sure"
110890,532361,4,Aldana,29/06/2019,"Clean, parcels a bit fair if you take a large vehicle, light included in price. The only thing is that to go to the beach you have to walk on the road about 150 meters. Highly recommended"

110890,496728,5,stokespandj,30/05/2019,"If you want a ‘holiday’ then this is the place. An oasis swimming pool with sun loungers & umbrella’s. Spotless toilets and showers (site new 2019). Staff speak several languages. Place to relax. Electric and water at each space. Black waste slightly awkward. However, we must suggest that in peak season it may feel very busy around the pool and views of mountains will be obscured from your next door neighbours. Overall though a great ‘resort’."

This is more about camping than the camper area. The bathrooms are beautiful. Impeccable hygiene. You can easily go to town and to the beach by bike. We will come back to it.

110890,428389,5,wardopepper,11/02/2019,"What a fabulous place this is. I would highly recommend it, the pitches are of various sizes and relatively flat. The showers are amazing and toilets are clean . The pool looks good unfortunately to cold to use this time of year. Shops and fabulous beach just a short stroll away. Definitely worth 5+ stars. Think this is going to get very busy and might be one you need to book as it’s going to be overtaken with long stayers which would be a shame for us tourers. Not officially open yet ! They say end of February."

110892,441151,1,laikatita,17/03/2019,I did not stay in this space as it does not seem suitable for motorhomes. It is next to a road which makes a quiet night impossible. Because there was no one else here. It can only be used to stop and enjoy the scenery.
110892,426789,5,matkalla,05/02/2019,Nice place. You ear the rooster and church bell in the morning. Nice view and quiet.

110927,1888161,5,antsinboots,13/05/2022,"This place is amazing. Fits maybe 5-7 cars. It's at the entrance to a large mostly unused recreation area with grills, shade and beautiful quiet. No signal whatsoever. 5 minutes away to a gorgeous laguna, up on the path, across the street.  There is another parking as well, 150m away towards the south."
110927,1813791,4,thu,10/04/2022,"Very good location to climb the Picacho and the Aljibe. Picnic area behind the parking wall and a very nice pond crossing highway 500. On weekends, place the AC well, because in the morning many cars arrive to go up the mountain."
110927,1770544,3,ELVIS54,01/03/2022,"I spent a night with a very strong lift. There is no service. A garbage container is missing, since it is a place very frequented by walkers and hikers. The incomparable landscape."

110927,444188,5,jerosapa,24/03/2019,"We were with our children and we were having lunch there. There are barbecues of material and some table and benches. A park xa the kids and a stream crossing a fence there. Right in front of this place there is a very nice and accessible path to all, under the mountain of the picacho."

Easy access and space to park and maneuver. As my colleagues say, GUY SKIDDING WITH THE CAR in the same parking lot. It didn't really affect us much, maybe because it wasn't the weekend, but come on, they were there too..."
110936,3247917,1,CruzRodriguez,02/09/2023,"Spectacular area, on the estuary, incredible views. I'm giving one star because at night it's full of thugs with their tuned car making wheels, it's a shame!!!!"
110936,3242845,4,cocosilla,31/08/2023,"Beautiful area, with a landscape that seems like a fairy tale. View of the estuary and the mountains. Quiet and spacious. We didn't sleep or use the services, we just parked to see the town and eat. The price of electricity is €2/hour, I don't think it is cheap, and water is just as cheap, taking into account its abundance in the area, I see it as a tribute to being able to enjoy the area. Still, I recommend"

110936,3196488,3,Hayar,21/08/2023,"We have emptied only, fill you have to pay and it only works with coins. We have not stayed overnight but it seems like a very good place."

110936,3180197,4,MartaPuchan,19/08/2023,"Very close to the town and beautiful views and walk. The bad thing is that they are having parties and the festival takes place next door, we haven't slept at all..."
110936,3179667,5,PaskusVan,19/08/2023,"Very wide area and very close to the old town, with very nice views of the river and the Pont de la Misericordia. Black's void area is awkward, but it's free. It's worth a stop in Viveiro. Free area, 2 minutes from the center, €2 to fill 100l of water, free emptying, more than 100 leveled and paved spaces, what more could you ask for? Thanks to the City Council for the area."
110936,3177171,3,RitxiAzzena,18/08/2023,Regular. 100L of water for 2 euros. Very narrow sewage drain.
110936,3173573,4,guau,18/08/2023,Very close to the center and the beach. It is very big so it is easy to find a place. We spent one night.
110936,3171169,4,maitanemorcillo,18/08/2023,"To spend one night it's fine. A little noisy at night but because you are in the center of town, a 2-minute walk away you have the historic center, square... Ample parking and if you go in the afternoon I don't think you'll have a problem parking, there's plenty of space."
110936,3123776,2,IsaacVishneviy,11/08/2023,"Near the town, plenty of space at any time. Only 1 emptying area. It will depend on the day you go, you will rest better or worse. It is a meeting area for young kids from the town with their tuned-up cars with the L on the rear window who are constantly circling the parking lot. It seems that the police or the city council don't care exactly the same."
110936,3088217,5,PulpoDuck14,06/08/2023,"Level area, with electricity and water services (paid but affordable). Very close to the center to visit the city. Somewhat noisy during the day, although at night it is quiet. Impressive views, thanks to the town hall for enabling this type of site."
110936,3074220,5,Alforjero,04/08/2023,Perfect to visit Viveiro with a little walk. Parking area extends without shade to.
110936,3046881,3,TonySon,30/07/2023,"Ideal for visiting the area, it is true that at night young people usually pass by in their powerful cars, but so do the police. So the problem doesn't last long."
110936,3036476,3,viano13,28/07/2023,"We stopped with the intention of spending the night, because the place looked good. It did not give us confidence, it seemed like the typical bottle place and we did not stay. The views are nice and there is plenty of space."
110936,3023573,1,vivaldikml,26/07/2023,"It's a pity that the police don't do their job well. Here and there, the youngsters with the cars doing rallying with the cars on, accelerating at full speed. Also, the water doesn't work, yesterday I put 4 euros into two machines and nothing. It's a shame."
110936,2965292,1,crichu98,15/07/2023,"Parking with views of the estuary and the port. The kids with the cars in groups like a bottle, joints, races, I'm young and I know what I'm saying. A pity to visit the town, leave us money and walk like this. The town is gorgeous but it's a shame that there are continually cars running around with exhaust pipes making a racket all over the town and area. Police mismanagement"
110936,2943780,3,ValerieAnita,09/07/2023,"Very clean, very good, but at 10 p.m. people with cars coming and leaving the engines running for hours and we breathe the exhaust fumes trying to fall asleep, and the noise on top of that... Buenas noches.. ."
110936,2849360,3,pepepepone,13/06/2023,"An area, which is very good, but a pity, that the water, in the second machine does not work and he swallowed the two euros, in the rest, a very nice town"
110936,2842928,5,Krux,11/06/2023,Good area to get to know this beautiful town. At this time the place of services was completely clean
110936,2651161,1,JennyMax,08/04/2023,"Thanks to the town hall for allocating this space to us. However, embarrassing on the part of some. It's sad to see how stupid people are. To be brief: people throw the black water where the gray. IT'S GROSS. Full of remains, paper... 4 places for filling and emptying, 3 of them occupied by people PARKED. Preventing the rest of us from using them. The best: some having dinner with the windows open and the smell of shit. I wouldn't even wish that experience on my worst enemy, the truth is that sometimes we earn the image we have by hand. If we don't take care of things when a city council makes an effort to make life easier for us, there will be fewer and fewer who do. For the rest, very ample parking and complete services. Filled with water €2"
110936,2648134,3,Burgaillo,07/04/2023,"Simple, a parking lot that had to be taken advantage of but it does its job and is appreciated."
110936,2610267,1,FamiliadeSella,15/03/2023,Very bad experience. They charged us two euros to refill the water and there was none. A few places. bad location

110936,2488079,2,Fredyzaragoza,08/11/2022,"As they say in previous comments, it is a meeting place for young people at night. They come with the cars. It's a shame, the place is not bad, but if you get the noisy gang, better go somewhere else."
110936,2475824,1,Emiliojlv,01/11/2022,unsafe area. Kids doing skids with cars and bottle. We had dinner at Viveiro and left there.
110936,2475216,3,Paciencia,31/10/2022,"Large space, to park all types of vehicles, it is not exclusive to ac. I do not recommend it for weekend nights or the eve of holidays. Area where kids meet to do the Indian with the car. It is close to the town and supermarkets, you can walk."
110936,2445837,4,olimpox,15/10/2022,"I don't give it a five because I don't like very urban areas, but it is a good place to get to know this beautiful corner of Lugo."

110936,2271736,3,jfmclouis,20/08/2022,Spacious place with services very close to the center with great views. We did not have a good night because of the young people who gather next to the motorhomes and dedicate themselves to skidding with the cars.

The problem came around 12 o'clock when several kids made a racket and skidded with their cars... a busy night, with calls to the police included... until 6 o'clock in the morning there was no calm."
110936,2249143,2,MC4333,16/08/2022,August 15 we tried to fill water in two of the posts and it returned the €1 coins. We were only able to empty the toilet.

110936,2227849,4,Patxo22,13/08/2022,Halfway between the beach and the old part of Viveiro and next to the estuary. Ideal to visit Viveiro. The negative point is that it seems to be a place for a night meeting of young people and they did not leave until after 2 am. Otherwise great. Our thanks to the City Council for letting us be in this place.
110936,2202039,4,lapolimitaenruta,09/08/2022,"Good place, near the beach, just keep in mind that in the evenings kids usually come in their cars and make a racket, they park near the building if you can stay away from it, better"

At night, however, also well frequented, driving on the street, people played football with cans. Fresh water is offered for 100 l for €2, but we could only fill up with 30 l. I'd say everything is average!"

110936,1801719,2,sloopy1,31/03/2022,There are four SP here. Two are already permanently occupied and not inhabited. The whole PP is often used as a posing mile for teenagers. The tire tracks tell of a lot of fun! check who has the loudest exhaust. Preferably at night. In other words: the night is not really relaxing and promotes good sleep.

Except for this detail, comfortable and quiet place."
110936,1738195,2,Caleyeros,21/01/2022,"CRAZY, 24 hours of light €48. Those responsible for the area make you look at it. On the other hand, the beautiful town with its old town is worth a visit. O Recuncho, O Asador and restaurant Pumariño, located on the LU 161 road and especially beautiful inside, are three places that are well worth a visit if you go hungry. I give it two stars because the light seems like a robbery to me, I hope they take action."
110936,1704696,4,Valtu.21,06/12/2021,"Well located in front of the beautiful city and its historic center. Large. I did not have noise problems, perhaps because it was November and during the week. I would go again."

Thank you Viveiro"

110966,1812180,4,SandWandx7,09/04/2022,Busy day. All right in the evening. Certainly there are quieter places. Location is great if you want to go to the city of Puerto de la Cruz. Lots of restaurants/hotels/minimarkets & shops with various items nearby.
110966,1791348,3,Boskowalsky,22/03/2022,"I slept from Sunday to Monday. Some movement at the beginning of the night but then quiet. Busy throughout the day. Luckily the wind did not blow much, the days that it does, the vehicle has to end up covered with saltpeter. Attached to the center of Puerto de la Cruz. Unbeatable location to get to know the city."

With strong waves you seem to be sleeping with a volcano and for a parking area I recommend closer to the lighthouse central since the waves splash on the wall Avda. And for the sheet metal and motor, the saltpeter is not so good ... Usually 10"

On walking distance is the Lago Martiánez, a huge ‘natural’ pool with showers, toilets, sunbeds for €5,50 a day (tip!) Downsides: busy and noisy in the weekends, your van will be covered in salt water, cars passing by all day, not a pretty place"

The toilet is also open directly in the park according to opening times from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. and on weekends from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Since we stayed there on a Friday, there were a lot of young people who met there and stayed in the square until late.

When we came back, the castle was broken by our multivan. We have filed a complaint with the police (mossos). The policeman told us to park here in the area only in the cities. Outside they drive little patrol because it is too far out and the crime is very high. Okay for a break, but keep an eye on the car !!"

Fantastic walks in the surrounding countryside and Belchite Viejo is well worth a visit. Would recommend Bar Earnesto amongst others.

In 2023, some still don't know what a trash can is for!!! 3 stars for the services but the city, it would be 0!!!"

111066,2648096,3,VTVan,07/04/2023,Functional and quiet area. We recommend the guided tour of the old town of Belchite (€8/person) destroyed during the civil war. The new town has services but no charm.

The day tour of Old Belchite is informative but the tour is only given in Spanish  - you can have an audio guide in English  (and I think French & German) although information is restricted. 
Evening tours only in Spanish - no other options available.  I must learn Spanish"

Water was NOT working when we was there."
111066,2444617,5,Neoblack,15/10/2022,"We have spent three nights here and we have been very good. Calm and quiet place. The only thing to improve perhaps, would be the type of terrain, since there is a lot of dust. Otherwise perfect. The people of this town are very welcoming, kind and friendly. We will return without hesitation. We take a nice memory of the town. We did the day and night guided tours of the old town of Belchite."
111066,2438409,5,nobo77,11/10/2022,A very nice place! Close to the city center and the most important attractions of the city! It was quiet and peaceful! We spent two pleasant nights here! We came here by accident but it was worth it! There is a piece of history in this ruined city! I also recommend the lovely shop with olive oil and other natural products! We thank the city authorities for this place!

If you speak Spanish, the guide is very informative. The audio guide was cumbersome."

111066,2320236,5,finansierra,30/08/2022,Water and emptying services ok. Electricity in plots after automated payment in turret. Take a long cable in case you get far from the turret. Not many squares and fair. Uneven and needs chocks. Belchite old town visiting at night is more intriguing. Peaceful place. Very hot eye.
111066,2317389,4,Krux,29/08/2022,Small and quiet area. I give it 4 stars because the water theme doesn't work. The old town deserves a must see. There is a swimming pool 400 meters away.

Visit to the old town (previous reservation) super obligatory."
111066,2203780,4,ripper_otr,09/08/2022,"Great area with the necessary services. It is very close to everything and is very quiet. Now only the services work through the App. The water filling service did not work and from the tourist office they consulted the company (a 10 by the City Council). Note: Later we realized that 5 meters across the street there is a source of great flow, to get out of trouble."
111066,2046507,5,Letruncia,07/07/2022,"Very quiet area in a very cozy town. Water for 1 euro and electricity for 5, in cash or card. The trees still don't provide much shade, but they manage. You can go to the old town on foot (you can only access it with a guided tour, which is very interesting), it takes about 10 minutes. The neighbors are very friendly, and the cupcakes from the bakery are terrible!"

111066,1802622,4,JPVDE,01/04/2022,Very clean car park but if you don't know Spanish it really isn't interesting to visit the old town reduced to rubble. The French audio guide gives 15 minutes of information on two hours of visits that you will have to “undergo” in Spanish the rest of the time. So it's very brief!

You are on the edge of town, between dull buildings and agriculture. Quite some trash and dog poo everywhere and a constant smell of fertilizers. While we appreciate the town for creating this for us, it's really not a site we'd come back to."

111066,793706,4,padraigl,10/03/2020,"This is a white stony/sandy parking area with 10 dedicated parking spaces divided by small trees. It can gets quite mucky in wet weather. The spaces are not level as they lean to one side and you will need chocks to level your motorhome.
They are not suitable for really large motorhomes (bus type) or motorhomes with trailers. The maximum stay is 48 hours.

Pros:
Free parking.
Free fresh water fountain.
Local small supermarkets, cafes and bars. 
Payed (€5 for 24 hrs) electricity points.

Cons:
No real shade.
Dirt/sandy underfoot.
NO grey drain.
NO black WC drain.

There is ONLY a fresh water tap across the road and some large bins on the road.
There are NO grey or black WC drains.
Electricity points are available. €5 for 24 hours payed at the tourist office.

The fresh water tap across the road is a push button tap. There is no screw-on connection for a hose and you will need a special rubber connection or a bucket/watering can.

The old town which is a ruin from the civil war is a must see. It's €6 to visit. The tickets are got at the tourist office or online. 
There are 2 small supermarkets and cafe/bars in the town. 
We completed a 3 hour return hike to Almonacid de la Cuba beside the nearly dry river bed. We also completed a fantastic circular hike of 3.45 hours with stunning views and passing the trenches of the civil war.

We had 3 very quiet nights here with 6 motorhomes the first night, 1 the second night and on our own the third night.
It wasn't a planned stop initially. Only because of the very strong winds across the plain while driving South we decided to stop here for a night that turned into 3, and we are very glad we did....

Bugs/Mosquitoes. (They love us..)
We did not encounter any mosquitoes here at the beginning of March."

111090,2644497,3,Aliceoc,06/04/2023,Missing Shadow. At the end of an urbanization so it depends on the day it is not so quiet. Nice place with good views
111090,2592424,3,Frago21,27/02/2023,"Quiet place and starting point for the mill route. I have parked in the parking lot. Please don't let it be noticed that we passed by there, let's pick up everything and leave nothing behind."
111090,2541153,5,vanevalencia,04/01/2023,"Good location, we spent a very quiet night. With picnic tables and chairs"
111090,1926785,3,juliangut,29/05/2022,"Flat terrain, very quiet, we have slept alone, there is no shade or services of any kind and the picnic tables are gone. There is a playground nearby. The dirt track to access the one Google commands is fatal, but there is an esplanade before starting the worst section of the road and you can park there perfectly (I add a new photo)"
111090,1203895,3,Rebo213,17/05/2021,"Quiet place, recommended area for walks with children. We slept alone on a Saturday. Complicadillo access as they have commented, we go down the dirt track with a bump at the end and we go out through the town, careful where you get into it. The bad thing that we had people from the bottle grilling next to it almost all night = blessed curfew."
111090,1194271,3,Ismana,12/05/2021,"Good site, but access is very difficult, do not follow the maps"
111090,1184231,5,LaGordi,03/05/2021,"An extraordinary area, in addition, the stores have natural products from the garden, something that is not found in Madrid."
111090,1154155,5,PilarLujan,20/03/2021,"Fantastic. We spent the night without any problem. A little wind but nothing more. Spectacular views and next to the Route of the Mills. You can also visit a civil war bunker elsewhere, near the church. Going up Miralcampo street there is no problem. Full bridge and only two ACs."
111090,1117062,2,FranciscoNaval,22/11/2020,"The site in general is fine. There must be an access through the streets of the town but if you do not know it, you run the risk of getting stuck, as they are very narrow streets. there is another access by the road and then a dirt track, but it is in very bad condition and with a lot of unevenness. going down is relatively good, but going up is more difficult. If your car is low profile, don't get out."
111090,830601,4,Fani...,20/06/2020,"In case the GPS puts you through the center of town, continue along Miralcampo street (we have uploaded a photo with directions) on the other side you are stuck. The neighbors have told us that it has happened on several occasions"
111090,772614,4,cheteac,26/01/2020,"We have slept here two nights and all very quiet and with spectacular views. Garbage cans at 20 m. The GPS made us go up to the upper part of the town and go down a path to the viewpoint. From the viewpoint the road goes out to make the route of the mills of the. We will repeat, for sure."
111090,481914,5,jimenezm,12/05/2019,The views and the sunrise from the hondillo viewpoint are incredible. It is important not to coincide with the festivities of the town because it is heard all night. Also keep in mind that in the morning the kids finish on this site as an Aftermath so you would get up early that day. For the rest of the most advisable to spend the night and wake up with the sound of birds
111090,426059,3,tominube,01/02/2019,"The site is great, and it is planned to put water and drains, you have to have planned that they are not parties because that is where activities are done"
111091,3287281,5,Xavigc1984,12/09/2023,"Excellent place to disconnect, ideal for spending the day or spending the night, picnic tables under the shade of the trees, different hiking routes. 100% recommendable"

111091,2899744,5,Kymera,28/06/2023,"Fantastic place to rest in the middle of nature. Impressive views and good walking routes. We spent two nights under a big tree, completely alone. There is a sign that informs that camping is prohibited and although it does not say anything about overnight stays, since it is a natural park It is assumed that it is not allowed. We did not see the foresters, but I imagine that they must often pass through the area"
111091,2767773,5,antoperso,20/05/2023,perfect in the middle of nowhere! The uphill exit from the area can be a bit complicated if it has been raining. No 4G on site but fountain for water.
111091,2693354,5,passot9,24/04/2023,"Super spot in the middle of nature with impressive views, pleasant walks. The weekend of the world during the day, alone in the evening."
111091,2548414,5,MoustacheTour,10/01/2023,"This is the definition of being in the middle of nature! Absolutely wonderful! The journey over a kilometer-long gravel road through a gorge in the mountains is spectacular. No artificial light, absolute silence, a wonderful night in the middle of nowhere. All-wheel drive is helpful in dry conditions, but not necessary."
111091,2515733,1,AlbaRuben,07/12/2022,"We can't find the site. poorly signposted We were in a large van, at night, there was not a single light on the road, also the road was fatal (poor care, sand and rocks, landslides) and almost upon arrival the road forked and there were no signs. There was no coverage, therefore we could not redirect the GPS...."
111091,1913152,4,TinaMaren,24/05/2022,"Impossible to reach this place with a normal motorhome, there is 6km of single track gravel road, then you're done. However, the last 300m are so steep that we parked above. Very quiet there, in the middle of the mountains. One always just hopes that no one will come towards you. A bit back is the start of a dreamlike, undemanding 6 km hike. Terrific"

111091,1882496,5,puntoturbo,10/05/2022,"Spectacular mountain views and very quiet area. I was able to get there with a 7-meter motorhome, although it is better to get there with a camper."
111091,1756801,5,AlbertoSonia,15/02/2022,"Very quiet and pleasant place. The track is mostly in good condition, only the last part (the one that accesses the area), not recommended for very low vehicles. The area has a fountain and picnic tables within the Parc Natural dels Ports. Starting point for 3 excursions through the valley with a couple of interpretive signs. Recommended. Let's take care of the place."

111091,1638883,5,Guetoman,11/10/2021,Beautiful site. We spent 2 nights and we were great. Space for many vehicles. There is a large esplanade with picnic tables and a fountain. There is no garbage. From there there are several trails to make different excursions. Highly recommended!
111091,1625085,5,mareuge,03/10/2021,"A scandal site, even if it says that it is for 4x4 we went with a Mercedes V and without problem, super quiet and perfect area for climbing and hiking. there is a fountain, picnic tables, etc. we will be back."

111091,1164364,5,Octopen,02/04/2021,"Magnificent place to spend the night and enjoy the walks of the day. many Campers and some stores. Around 6 in the afternoon, the rural agents passed by and sanctioned the stores and the Campers that had advance mounted, otherwise no problem."
111091,1162770,5,Danikalaf,01/04/2021,Amazing place and exit for many routes
111091,1139686,5,pholi,20/02/2021,"Perfect place for camping, shadows, wooden tables, two small rafts with water and several itineraries on foot and by bike to do in a wonderful enclave of Par Natural Els Ports, Cassette Velles area. ATTENTION, the place is called La Vall, not Mas de Barró. Al Mas de Barró is 3.5 km away, 800 m of unevenness along a path that starts from here"
111091,1093475,4,Beltzane,14/10/2020,Very beautiful place. The path is fine but if they are not cared for it can be complicated. 5 km track. There are nice trails around.

111091,610559,2,vanaperencamping,08/08/2019,"Nice spot, but we were eaten by an agressively biting insect... strong repellent didn’t help. Decided not to spend the night here.                               Note: the last 5 km to get there are on a rocky road, 4x4 not necessary. We did it with an ordinary fiat dethleffs camper. This was doable. But i wouldn’t recommend it to people with really big or low base campers."
111091,430303,5,pordini,17/02/2019,"Superb spot! Should be okay with two wheel drive vans I think, just be careful.
Awesome silence. There is drinking water from a tap (non controlada), picknicktables, shade, awesome hiking possibilities."
111096,1761643,4,RobertoSimo,20/02/2022,"I stopped in front of the football fields and spent a quiet night. You can quickly reach the center on foot thanks to a mainly pedestrian path. No services, just street parking"

111098,2347277,2,d2clon,07/09/2022,"ok to save the night. it is calm. but it is not a good place, there is noise from the high way and the whole surface is at an angle.

be careful with the holes in the concrete floor, they are perfect to destroy your wheel"
111098,1769153,4,schnurriburli,28/02/2022,"Many thanks to the finder of this place. We had a super nice night, against the incline there are wedges or hydraulics. For the users who want the whole area all around, there is only one tip: stay at home or buy a Porta Potti, then we real motorhome enthusiasts will have such places."
111098,782140,2,die_weitenbummler,18/02/2020,"It is very uneven, there is only a straight parking space directly in front of the cemetery wall. The course is very noisy as it is in the direct entry lane from the nearby airport. At night, many trucks drive right past the street. No water and toilet. Only the short connection to the motorway is a plus."

111126,3205303,3,LinceNomada,23/08/2023,"I don't know how people can like this place so much. It is an exclusive area for those who have Movistar since there is no coverage with other companies because you have to call by phone to get the code if you come to the City Hall in the morning, I think you can solve it. It is a concrete esplanade, so in summer it must be twice as hot. There is not a tree or shadow"

It's a pity that, in order to walk around the town, we have to walk a good part of the way along the road, since the sidewalks are occupied by cars. But that is already a matter of the City Council. But the area, for a symbolic price, is impeccable."
111126,3138193,5,Dalonsju,13/08/2023,"What can we say about this area, it is a 10! It has everything, everything is clean and cared for and if you go to the town hall to pay them they are charming. In addition, he says that they will soon invest more in AC and install other services such as washers and dryers. It is 10 minutes from some beautiful waterfalls and the Val Porquero cave. We will definitely repeat! Thanks to the Cármenes city council for taking care of the campers!"

Two complete toilets with shower and hot water! Only €5 from Friday to Friday, impressive. You have to go to the Las Nieves restaurant to register and pick up the key. THANK YOU CARMENES for this authentic gift."
111126,2559093,4,todoma,23/01/2023,There is no reception in the area. You have to cross the entire town and buy the token that allows you to open and close the door at the Las Nieves bar for €5. I found it with a lot of snow and ice and the door open. The bathrooms are very clean with hot showers. There are no electrical outlets outside and they do not allow you to use the interiors to connect to the vehicle. There is no electrical connection service

Great for charging everything overnight. Unfortunately we didn't meet anyone and there are no signs where to leave the money. We put it in the mailbox."
