95383,2452181,4,bubuvantana,19/10/2022,We parked our Sprinter here for 3 hours (€3.90). For us personally it was the only option to visit the LX Factory Market on foot. Suitable for mobile homes / campers ect. There are no prohibition signs.
95383,787469,1,josferr19,27/02/2020,"The area is not recommended. We parked during the day, and they broke a glass to steal. There were more caravans than they also stole"
95383,738964,5,milouk1,05/11/2019,Very convenient to visit the center of Lisbon. 5 € Max for the day. No height limit. There is an underpass just up to the train station. Passing by enough not to fear theft
95383,652460,1,furgoviaje,23/08/2019,We arrived at night ... after dinner one of security came to tell us that we could not spend the night there ... so it is not valid for campers or motorhomes.
95383,383822,1,sergio5012,28/09/2018,"Cradled by the gentle sound of the ring, helped by the passage of planes every quarter of an hour, bewitched by the sounds of trains and motorcycles, languished by the music of the nightclub and supported by all these young people who came out of it. At 5 in the morning we spent the night to record the noise. Tired of this little game we fell asleep around 6 am to be woken around 770 by the people who went to work. To avoid abusing good things we changed the resort. In summary TO ABSOLUTELY FUIR"
95383,353879,1,cimberian,26/08/2018,"Very, very noisy place at night due to the area of ​​bars, trains, airplanes and cars ... The next day a parking attendant came and kindly told us that we could not park there because of port regulations, although no there is no sign at the entrance to the parking lot."
95385,3079690,5,ermanu,05/08/2023,Perfect place to spend a day. Ample level and firm ground parking. Beach not crowded even in August
95385,1892547,1,Furgolover,15/05/2022,Gate closed with padlock today 05/15/2022.
95385,1489693,3,sanchezdongil,21/08/2021,"The place is cool, perfect to spend the day but they didn't let us spend the night."
95385,1465466,4,Mrs.Bohosoul,16/08/2021,"Ideal beach to go with your dog. Be careful with stones when bathing. If you go by car / AC, van you have to be careful somewhere because there is sand and it can be difficult to get out. We have been staying the night on 08/14/2021. Quiet zone. It does not have any services nearby such as toilets, showers, fountain or something similar. We wanted to spend the night on 08/15/2021 but the civil protection unit arrived"
95385,1458086,3,KingKev93,14/08/2021,"Great spot to spend the day by the beach. It’s a military zone so they close at 10 pm. However, it looks like they kick people out on fridays and during the weekends, the rest of the week it looks viable to spend the night. Also, the road is a little tricky with some sand banks so be careful."
95385,1423147,5,yerayfueetes,08/08/2021,"It closes at 10 at night, opens at 8 in the morning. Nudist beach, with dogs ... you can do anything. Be very careful with trying to go to the second parking area, danger of being trapped by the sand (I say this from experience) good place to visit, come and see it."
95385,1287205,4,VanFather,30/06/2021,"Great place to spend the day cooling off. Plenty of places to park, trash bins but nothing else. Beautiful beach!
Gates close at 22 pm."
95385,912549,4,jaimemata,30/07/2020,"Great to spend the day with the children and enjoy the day, be careful with the sand because you can get trapped, dirt lane to go slowly is worth visiting"
95385,832408,2,OscarLlorente,22/06/2020,"I have not known how to get off the asphalt road towards the dirt road. At least with a normal van, I have seen a section that could possibly bridge the gap with an SUV. We could not enjoy it :("
95385,642803,4,mcollado,19/08/2019,"Good place to spend a day near the sea, at night too lonely, you have to be careful with the sand because it is possible to get a little trapped although if you move through the grass area I do not think there is a problem"
95385,610313,4,markitosleioa,08/08/2019,"Very cool beach walk, you have to be careful with the sand you can get caught"
95436,1663089,5,LiaRie,26/10/2021,"Even though it says ""Água não controlada"" we got some liters and are drinking it since yesterday without any issues. Plenty of space to park in front of it."

95440,3047561,5,marco38410,30/07/2023,"Nice quiet place with great view. Viewpoint of Cividade. 2 picnic tables. Departure on foot for other points of view. For access, follow the road with the motorhome indication then a wide path (Waze took us to shortcuts that were not very/impracticable)."
95440,3011299,4,frododebilbo,24/07/2023,"Impossible to go up to the viewpoint with the van, it seems that they are making a firebreak and they have eaten the track. At the crossroads that separates the Cividade viewpoint and the Boqueiriño viewpoint I have spent the night without a problem, it is not a paradisiacal place but it does the trick. It was pretty full of trash. I've picked up all the trash I've seen, let's see if it lasts."
95440,2862489,5,Gilou74,17/06/2023,"Superb, alone in the world at the watchtower. The few km of stony path to arrive pass without problem. A flat pitch just before the concrete slab, which is barely sloping, lots of space, magnificent view, sunset, and only the sound of birds to wake us up..."
95440,2337683,2,LABOINA,04/09/2022,"Narrow and dirt road, in addition to being in very poor condition"
95440,2162267,5,yayat5,02/08/2022,great spot! magnificent view. there is a kind of fairly flat slab. not a sound at night. the access road is quite long with one half not coated but it is really worth the detour.
95440,2020495,4,heinechristensen,29/06/2022,Spent one night here. Pretty nice spot with picnic tables and a restaurant right by. View point close by is spectacular
95440,1904992,4,cteney,21/05/2022,"incredible view. very quiet night. passage of only 1 car on the evening. picnic tables available, shaded area slightly sloping spot. access on the last kilometers by a dirt road in correct condition (a few holes but passable) quite a few flies on the other hand."
95440,1383569,4,FerranMartorell,30/07/2021,"Spectacular site, with an incredible sunset and amazing views. Slight slope. We have spent a very quiet night, perhaps too much, since there is no light at all and there was no one else. At 00:00 when we were already asleep, he stopped a car next to him and left immediately. They gave us a scare ..."
95440,1335735,5,BegoBardaji,18/07/2021,"Amazing place to spend the night, with a beautiful sunset. It is next to the viewpoint of A Cividade, spectacular. The trees offer a bit of shade, and there are a couple of picnic tables and garbage. There is no fountain or toilets or any other service. There are also possible routes to do from here that are super cool parallel to the Sil River. We had a very quiet night."
95452,720619,1,emaki,13/10/2019,"Salty and near power lines, uninteresting"
95462,965340,1,dariooo16,15/08/2020,"The forest guards usually pass by, the last time they kicked us out and told us that we cannot stay overnight"
95462,653480,3,victormarin87,23/08/2019,It is totally forbidden to spend the night and camp. Forest guards watch a lot
95467,2509889,2,Holwerdacamper,01/12/2022,A quiet parking lot but it is not quiet. You can also hear the road at night.
95468,3151335,5,furgonero,15/08/2023,area to spend the night peacefully and the day!!!! very dark night!!! ideal for rest!!!! Every now and then an acorn hits the van!!!! things from nature!!!! nice place!!!
95468,1245672,3,xtina88,09/06/2021,"I guess the site is fine, at least what people are saying. I could not enjoy it as it was forbidden to go with dogs"
95468,893966,4,Mayi6857,24/07/2020,"Really a place to enjoy, the indications take us out at the first exit, a little before finding the direction to O Bolo, we rest well but the parking that faces the other side of the river is better, wider and with more shade. Silent, few people, closed services."
95468,787130,5,eburton,26/02/2020,"Lovely quiet spot, we didn't see anyone all evening or in the morning. would recommend. the play park was sweet, but the services were closed when we visited (february), but I can imagine it would be busier in summer."
95468,510599,5,orangehalls,10/06/2019,Beautiful spot. Well looked after. Gorgeous little River that you can dip your toes in. Outside showers. Toilets. (not sure how often they are open). Nice park and a bridge for a game of poo sticks.
95469,3154662,5,denislabruyere,15/08/2023,"Superb view, no nuisance. Easy access with a 7m, but ok for any type of CC. We spent the night."

95469,3076088,5,lauradigi,04/08/2023,Magnificent spot. Very nice view of the lake. Very easy to access. Shady area and picnic tables.
95469,2951537,5,Lplz,11/07/2023,"Incredible spot. It doesn't get any easier, it's 10 meters along the road. Little passing. Crazy view, quiet. Table for dinner."
95469,2900143,5,IsaTofvanlife,28/06/2023,"very quiet spot, superb view of the Lima, we stayed there for 2 nights, arriving there only in the evening; attention paved slope to access it (reserved for small vans) location devoid of services but we easily find enough to fill up (water, merkado ...) in Sojao located 3 km above (with large and equipped motorhome area toilets and shower at 7 euros per night)."
95469,2626969,5,Yann_en_van,27/03/2023,"Beautiful place, very quiet, with great view and nice walks when you go down by the river. I could even launch my paddle board and go for a stroll on the river. I spent the night. I wouldn't recommend for big motorhomes though. Steep descent, tight turns, and limited parking space on grass which would get damaged by heavy vehicles."
95469,2603148,4,Hailee,08/03/2023,"A beautiful place, however even small motorhomes shouldn't try to enter when it's wet, as it is steep and paved with round stones."
95469,2565029,5,marleneundelia,31/01/2023,"Beautiful view, we spent two nights there, very peaceful! Beautiful walks along the Lima from there"
95469,2431417,4,martinww,08/10/2022,Good place to stay. Quiet night. No traffic.

95484,3061430,5,melgaria86,02/08/2023,"It's a pine forest, a huge parking lot across from a water park. We spent the night super quiet and very cool!"
95484,3026833,4,mariondesk,27/07/2023,We stayed in the afternoon to take a nap but lots of shadows and very quiet. There is room. Do not go to the parking lot of the water park but just after it is better. A bit of passage but for the region it's fine.
95484,3005154,5,Orueta92,23/07/2023,It is a very quiet pine forest. We have slept without problems.
95484,2918117,4,sandra_03,03/07/2023,"It's enough for one night. Arrived there in the evening and left in the morning before the aqua park next door had opened its doors. Thus, a quiet night without incident spent!"
95484,2879706,4,guillaumette65,22/06/2023,"quiet shady place, quiet night."
95484,2876425,1,KlausBurkel,21/06/2023,"The place is more of a parking lot than nature. surrounded on all sides by busy streets and residential buildings. A lot of people walk through the park in the morning and in the evening. maybe that doesn't matter for a night in the RV. If you need more privacy from a smaller car, you should not stay here."
95484,2875831,1,surroundedbynature,21/06/2023,"if i could zero stars, absolutely not in nature. from all sides road and not good even for one night. absolutely restless!!!"

95484,2811906,5,lotustravelgirl,02/06/2023,"Very quiet area with plenty of space to put the camper. Thanks to the trees there was shade. Sufficiently clean area, some rubbish here and there even though there are rubbish bins. Alas there was also some smelly human faeces… but only in some places. Place we will return to. Free, quiet at night and in the middle of nature."
95484,2794348,5,AnHe99,28/05/2023,"Very nice! I slept wonderfully. It's calm, windless, relatively clean, with shade on hot days and other campers next to you. Next to the forest there is another water park, in the morning you can hear screaming people riding the roller coaster."
95484,2753486,4,jp85,16/05/2023,"one star less, we slalom among the canine waste .... otherwise, very good, calm, very large, flat ground."
95484,2734012,5,Kimskrams,08/05/2023,I drove onto the square because I needed shade again. The place is relaxed and relatively quiet. Google redirects a little weirdly but there are several entrances to use.
95484,2704395,5,natanael29,28/04/2023,"Quiet place with lots of space, there is nothing nearby but it is in the middle of a forest of trees, I recommend it for a night or two."
95484,2661376,5,Nur88,11/04/2023,"Really calm, some neighbours. There is plenty of shadow. Perfect to spend a night."
95484,2656091,5,jodyalbers,09/04/2023,Verry nice place to spend the night when park is closed in off season.
95484,2586627,4,Vitrvevlasech,22/02/2023,"good place to spend the night, but nothing interesting around"
95484,2539691,4,Hadini,03/01/2023,"Nice place to take a break. However, I didn't want to sleep there, the place can be seen from every side."
95484,2539275,5,HauruVan,03/01/2023,"came late, just one van, lots of place, quite flat with gravel. very quiet at night, some dogs in the morning. recommend for a rest stop."
95484,2532781,3,Pananda,29/12/2022,good to stand there one night. We heard a lot of dogs barking. Otherwise nice location.

95484,2262981,4,Megatriu90,18/08/2022,"Good place for day and night, very quiet overnight! Lots of shade! It is not 5 stars because of the amount of dog droppings in the pine forest!"
95484,2255077,5,PENNETIER,17/08/2022,"Very good spot for the night. Around 12:30 p.m., an employee of the water park asked us to leave, telling us that it was not a campsite. Overnight parking is tolerated, but you have to move in the morning to let the cars park because this is the parking lot of the park, even if it is very large."
95484,2204305,2,Hunter_Dreams,09/08/2022,"Although at night it is fine and there are no problems, during the day there is a lot of noise coming from the park and there are staff throwing you out if you do not come to the park. Signage is also pretty bad."
95484,2177063,5,Aritzetxeba,05/08/2022,"Very good place to spend a night, easy to get to with good shade. Be careful with the location that can send you to the center of town."
95484,2173645,5,nunolourenco,04/08/2022,"very good area to have a picnic and relax, lots of shade and plenty of space., don't forget to respect nature, no services, good for autonomous vans, however we don't stay overnight so we don't know if it's allowed or safe, ✌️✌️"

95484,1904711,5,SabrinaGust,21/05/2022,"We spent 2 quiet nights here. Didn't hear any noise from the waterpark. The occasional walker with a dog, but that's it! Loved it!"
95484,1891182,5,StrandBude20,15/05/2022,"We spent a very quiet night. Now and then a few planes that you can hear, but didn't bother us."
95484,1887708,4,Ragnar666,13/05/2022,"Great extended spot lots of privacy. No toilets, garbage cans at the entrance. Not very close to town, but we stayed here for a while since we were really quiet."
95484,1872196,4,b3rny,05/05/2022,"Very quiet pine forest to rest one night. When the water park is open they use it as a parking lot, so even in season you won't even be able to sleep. The whole neighborhood takes the dog for a walk there, but just go a little deeper into the pine forest and that's it."
95484,1850697,5,logan7885,24/04/2022,"Perfect, secluded location. ""Nature"" places are rare in Portugal, but this one is outside the amusement park season."
95484,1850372,4,Basilico,24/04/2022,"We arrived there at night a little perplexed because the 2 addresses mentioned do not indicate the same place .... (take the gps coordinates). Quiet night and no problems to report. Of course we had a few planes but that was not disturbing. The place is shady, and relatively clean. Watch out for dog poop though."
95484,1764527,3,Hippiegirl,24/02/2022,"Large parking lot of a currently closed water park. We stood here one night with two cars and no one seems to mind. With a busy road next door and dogs barking, it's not super quiet here, but it's fine for one night. Unfortunately a bit dirty."
95484,1758501,5,pietleijen,17/02/2022,Beautiful place to stay overnight. Just spoke to a few locals who say it's ok.
95484,1677090,5,Benzoe,04/11/2021,"Nice and quiet for a one nighter if you get tired on a big drive up or down A2/A22 highways. If you drive a little deeper into the woods, the surface gets gravelier and more even."
95484,1677074,3,SophiiiAne,04/11/2021,I arrived at night. The place is nice to spend the night. Lots of dog walkers the next morning. I was just disappointed to see the multitude of garbage leaving the place while the place was nice and natural.
95484,1675596,5,laessigebaie,03/11/2021,"Good for the night, quiet"
95484,1650487,5,findurfreedom95,18/10/2021,Clean and quiet place to spend the night in what feels like nature. recommended
95484,1448919,2,Jununus,13/08/2021,"Very average ! Lots of cars, noise in general ..."
95484,1336465,3,Davori,18/07/2021,"Easy access and relatively clean, we picked up some bottles that had been left behind. 

The waterpark service area had some kids doing donuts with their cars at 0100 though, and if staying near the wsterpark you're basically on a locals` shortcut. 

Fine for one night."
95484,904653,1,spowerre,27/07/2020,"Entry prohibited for motorhomes ""and the like"" seems to be due to covid19. We did not stay."
95484,791927,4,reimo62,06/03/2020,In March there’s a lot of trash. But otherwise quiet and nice.
95484,769681,3,shaunandcharlotte,18/01/2020,"Spent the night here, nice place to relax when the sun is out, beware of the procession caterpillars, they are super poisonous to some dogs and are nesting now. There is rubbish around, usual ‘vanlifers’ that don’t have a toilet in the van and poo then leave tissue paper laying around. Dogs barking could keep you up if you’re a light sleeper. Lovely for the day but not so sure on an evening. No problems just quite dirty here."
95484,739277,1,Christnnne,06/11/2019,Dirty place full of waste and dog poo
95484,625441,3,cathetjef,13/08/2019,"It is actually an extension of the Aquashow water park car park, perfect for overnight stays. From May to September, the car park is filled from 9:30 to 20h. Easier access by the aqua park car park."
95484,518608,5,OutdoorsChris,17/06/2019,We stayed here for 1 night. Nice and calm.

95495,1090854,3,apeudeterreta,12/10/2020,The terrain is quite uneven. The night we spent there was a lot of wind and it was very noticeable. difficult access by AC. On the other hand if there is no other option left to spend a night it is fine.
95507,2661228,5,meryjou84,11/04/2023,"We have slept the best of the nights that we have been there, the truth is that I was not betting much on this place and a luxury, or the only one that is not an area, it is only a parking lot for one night and a couple of vans is worth it .. But it is not suitable for them,"
95507,1732997,3,Neildy,13/01/2022,"Very good stopover, quiet with very nice local people, little traffic noise so a good night's sleep ready for the onward journey south."

Very quite and almost no traffic during night but this changes around 5/6 am. At 8am just a regular road with much more traffic. I can only recommend this if you want a short night and continue the road.
95652,3118942,4,Liberte85,11/08/2023,"A place not to be missed, come not too late. a small tavern, you will be waiting for tender music, street lamps, plane trees, a peaceful place full of freshness.

95708,2461929,1,MaximeWeltz,25/10/2022,Parking not flat and very dirty. Which has the merit of being free with room for large motorhomes out of season. We didn't stay long. The city is dirty and filled with revelers. It is absolutely not a recommendable place for families.

The ruins are really worth exploring as they have underground tunnels leading to cliff top gun emplacements. The road is ghastly!  We have a low slung Knaus Sun Ti and we had our hearts in our mouths!  But it was really worth it. Great biking and hiking routes all around.

Please behave."

Parking without regard for local residents, blocking entrances and exits, they stay for much longer than they should (48hrs). This is a wild camping spot that is patrolled daily by the GNR and will no doubt be shut down if misuse is continued. Should you be wild camping if you can't fit in a carpark?"

This site, besides being free, is located on top of a spectacular beach, much prettier than Alvor. While access to the beach is a mess because there are all private properties in front that make it difficult to go directly to the beach it is worth the walk because the beach formed by all coves with rocks is spectacular. The easiest way to get to the town is to go down the road (it has a wide sidewalk) and in 5 minutes you reach a restaurant area with some nightlife next to the beach."

When we arrived there were many ACs and campers. About 1 o'clock the police passed by and went around the whole place. So that everything remains the same, let's respect the place: don't litter and collect a little from each place to keep it clean. Be civic."
95844,2046711,5,Albigle,07/07/2022,"One step away from the beach and with nearby services. Very calm. We come every year and for the moment it remains the same, you can tell that they take care of it because the pines are pruned and the grass is destroyed. Let's hope that among all it will continue to be so. The beach is very good for walking, for children with its pools and easy-to-climb rocks, it has showers, a beach bar, a lifeguard..."

You can access trails right from the site and hike for hours through gorgeous wilderness. There are restrooms - locked in early April- that may be open when it’s busier. Follow major roads on Google maps to access - we turned down a small local road accidentally and it was very difficult to get through with a van."
95849,2630494,5,Wunderkinder,30/03/2023,"Mega mega great place. The village is absolutely quiet, hardly any traffic. The place is super big and it's easy to find a place, and when it rains it's also great because it's paved. The forest is so magical, there are so many beautiful hiking trails and climbs, so much to see and a wonderful place to relax. Be careful lots of dogs loose and barking at night from time to time."

95973,3039749,3,kekov12,29/07/2023,"They have a new direction, you can see that they are excited and want to do well. Still, it seems expensive. Two adults, two children, AC and light €41. It is small and lacks services. If you like the bike it is ideal to walk through La Zona Alfa, the latter is the only attraction that the campsite has."
95973,2719687,1,gertruudsgroenebus,03/05/2023,Campsite is closed.
95973,2358335,4,Claudinedumorbihan,10/09/2022,"very pleasant campsite....the feeling of being alone in the world. yes it's true the toilets deserve to be rejuvenated, but frankly it does! I like that better than a super extra campsite full of people. very friendly welcome. 28 euros per night. 2 persons. van and electricity"
95973,2294156,2,leia,24/08/2022,"Very neglected campsite. poor cleanliness of bathrooms, showers etc. The shower water burning. Large and shaded pitches. The municipal swimming pools next door are great."
95973,2280376,5,SaFontCalenta,21/08/2022,"Beautiful, easy access with an Ac, large plots. You are surrounded by mountains and nature. We stayed a few days with the children, they went everywhere with the bikes. I recommend it."
95973,2243236,4,Mendizale,15/08/2022,"Motorhome, 2 adults and a child €35. Nice, relatively flat sections, electricity. Properly lit at night, which is dark enough to sleep well and see the stars. Clean pool and services. Pleasant welcome. Two different places to change the black and gray water, the black next to the kumun, you have to go up the stairs, and the gray outside the campsite. It is not adapted for motorhomes."
95973,2181634,4,portegalope,05/08/2022,"The price for two adults with an AC is €28/day, really good during the week! It is quiet and a good atmosphere in general. It has all the camping and the town has shops to buy what you need. The restaurant that is not active would be missing but the rest is correct. We stayed two days... that is a bit of a mess with the plots but the rest is correct."
95973,2118841,4,goyini,24/07/2022,"it is open and working except the restaurant, including swimming pool with lifeguard, showers with hot water (very hot) 10 min. of the town walking. bathe watching the mountains the best ..... next to the municipal swimming pools."
95973,1838485,1,Enaio,19/04/2022,"We have approached the campsite today and they have told us that it was closed for works for the summer. A job, it looked good."
95973,1160538,2,laurafer,29/03/2021,"Quality- Terrible price. Expensive for the services it offers. The bathrooms without heating, the shower button and not very hot. Very old and neglected sink area. There is no water to discharge, they send you out of the campsite. The owner did not give us any information about the area, he referred us to the panels that were around the town. I do not see it very prepared for motorhomes, although the environment is beautiful."
95973,922612,5,trabajoeme,02/08/2020,"Fabulous **** campsite with spacious pitches, swimming pool and restaurant. It also has barbecues and space for children to play. Very nice staff cleaning common areas fantastic .."
95973,919598,5,BENIMAR497,01/08/2020,"Good treatment, good work from Pedro and family, the perfect pool, I do not use covid issues, but it is Very quiet"
95973,917841,2,Labaron,01/08/2020,"The price is € 35 for a motorhome and two adults, so it is not what is indicated in the description. In the boys' bathroom only one shower worked and had no pressure, the sinks were destroyed. The camping area has shade but the pitches are not. The positive part is that check out is until 22:00."
95973,873745,5,jlred1978,16/07/2020,"Friendly staff, clean showers and toilets. The landscape and the campsite is beautiful. It has a swimming pool, restaurant and more than powerful electricity. Recommended for families and children, very quiet and very cool at night. In the environment it is the best."
95973,871147,5,BosquedeGordon,15/07/2020,"I am Pedro Fernández responsible for the campsite since June 1, 2019, on behalf of my team and personally I want to thank you for all the criticisms and evaluations you make. We are aware that there are many things to do and to improve but we are working on it and we will not cease in our efforts so that you are looking forward to seeing us again, to think that even being our house from the moment you enter the door it is yours and that is how we want you to feel . I reiterate my love and gratitude to each and everyone."
95973,637022,5,Charocvi,17/08/2019,Totally recommended. Large plots and everything very clean. Very friendly staff. He eats well in the restaurant and
95973,493728,1,marcawi,27/05/2019,On 26.05.2019 the place was closed. More could not find out locally. (As in Leon) We stayed in the parking lot before.
95973,344744,5,Marsopio,20/08/2018,Camping super quiet. With very large plots. Cleansed. Good value for money.
95984,3201989,2,LinceNomada,22/08/2023,"A place that has little or nothing to be quiet since it is next to the road and if we add to that the number of cars that come to the sports center or the pool. The only interesting thing in the town are the supermarkets to replenish stocks, but Don't even think about stopping to have a beer because they crack you up. They charged me 1.60 for a fifth of a small beer and for an aperitif, I really wanted to."
95984,2275341,4,niceia,20/08/2022,"We slept one night there very calmly and with no inclination, crossing the footbridge 10 minutes walk away is the center of town."
95984,1471401,5,jonatanpardo,17/08/2021,"Parking in the sports facilities. We stopped to eat in the shade. Very economical municipal swimming pool for hot days. The picnic areas are by the river, at the end of the street you turn left onto another street with trees and you arrive."
95984,1101918,1,joelle91,22/10/2020,Good for lunch.
95984,1011453,3,Stinovic,29/08/2020,"Good parking lot, not very quiet. Lots of cars at night. To do something? Also not very suitable for digging holes."
95984,682813,4,Jenofanes,09/09/2019,Quiet parking surrounded by low buildings and therefore controlled ... decent overnight without services.
95984,682810,4,Jenofanes,09/09/2019,Quiet parking without more ... for controlled overnight as it is surrounded by buildings ...
95984,665577,4,RJK,28/08/2019,"Access from the south: At the roundabout on the parallel road to the sports center! If you drive to the parking lot and in front of the tennis courts left, you come to the picnic area. There we stood alone, because right next to the thoroughfare it is quite loud."
95984,338338,5,Relizard,16/08/2018,"We have spent the night and no problem: we thought we would have noise on the N630 but nothing, everything quiet. A comfortable stop after crossing the port and with little desire to enter León."
95996,3091381,3,Beaz,06/08/2023,We have not been able to park on the esplanades... all with chains to prevent entry. we park in the blue zone
95996,2764741,5,arisnur,19/05/2023,"A very pretty and very very quiet town, little population to have the port that takes you to La Graciosa. we parked in the blue zone and we had no problems"
95996,2565196,4,Ruvisa250,31/01/2023,Great flat to spend the night super close to the port to go to La Graciosa. very quiet night
95996,1366039,4,enaitz4,26/07/2021,"Large car park to spend the night. When you take the tickets to the ferry, the company tells you where to leave and there is no problem to spend the night. This is Romero's parking line. Very large parking at the back of the village. By taking the tickets for the ferry company Línea Romero they tell you where to spend the night. Very quiet place to spend the night."
95996,1183050,5,JuanCarlosSantanaSantana,01/05/2021,It is not where it is marked is at the beginning of the esplanade
96041,3260809,3,kevincampervan,05/09/2023,"too windy, we stopped just to see the viewpoint and the old building"
96041,3157521,5,lucabeltrame2,16/08/2023,Great place to sleep at night. very windy.
96041,3105200,5,jumiclea,09/08/2023,"Good parking lot with a great view to absolutely see! It was VERY windy, but we still slept very well."
96041,3074140,5,luckyfamily31,04/08/2023,The wind turbines didn't work during the night so the place was very quiet. Breathtaking view. Very windy and therefore cold even in the middle of summer!
96041,3051128,5,JEAN-LUCC66,31/07/2023,"Magnificent location and views, without services, open to the 4 winds, hence the presence of wind turbines, which did not prevent us from having a great night..."
96041,3032993,5,dronesicaro,28/07/2023,"Wonderful place to spend the night, very close to one of the best viewpoints of the Vixia-Herbeira cliffs. Calm and quiet area, despite being next to a wind farm. Level parking, and area with many animals."
96041,2958738,5,olgal60,13/07/2023,Perfect place to visit the cliffs. A bit windy.
96041,2602286,4,vryga,08/03/2023,"Place is fine, parking is just a part of the road, however it is not busy. It can be SUPER WINDY and foggy. The viewpoint is super nice tho."
96041,1874354,4,HotelBravo,07/05/2022,"Super nice view. I had stronger wind and you should be more careful. In any case, it's a place I didn't want to miss when I was driving through."
96041,1741054,2,Rasjahcor,25/01/2022,"Good to see the cliffs and it seems like a quiet place and not very crowded but I did not find it cozy to stay for the night, it is not very level and there are brutal places in the area how to stay here between the road and the wind farm."
96041,1407919,3,NomadasCharlatanes,05/08/2021,"From Cariño road in perfect condition. It was very windy, rainy and foggy and we couldn't see anything but on clear days it must be amazing."
96041,1351410,3,Peibolilla,22/07/2021,The place promised a lot but we had closed fog and we could not see anything more than 20m ahead. the path to climb is narrow although with widening so that there are no problems
96041,1295969,4,khalizzi,04/07/2021,"Nice view, 200 m far from the cliffs, wild horses and cows, lots of heavy wind, no public toilets. Near windmills, but we didn’t mind the „noise“. We spent a night there and were the only van in the big parking space."
96041,924618,5,Guzmi,03/08/2020,Breathtaking view. Just the Ocean and  the windmills..
96041,888177,3,gdegand,22/07/2020,Shaken all night because of a lot of wind! Area to avoid in these conditions ...
96041,718743,4,ontheroadwithdog,11/10/2019,"Very wide area, surrounded by cows and wild horses. Incredible views despite the permanent fog. We didn't sleep there, but we didn't get the impression that the wind farm was a nuisance for rest."
96041,660597,5,alemantrad,26/08/2019,Indeed a magnificent site and a few meters spectacular views. The only problem is the frequent fog that does not let you see anything but to spend a quiet night is ideal.
96041,588117,5,LNC,31/07/2019,"Spectacular fields of wind turbines, and fields where graze cows and horses, sea view, small steep road to get there, but worth it, possible to sleep easily!"
96065,3071711,4,Canarias_Viaja,03/08/2023,"Good place, in the car parks of the intermarche, the washing machine is good, filled and emptied, free of charge and the possibility of washing your vehicle. I have not slept here."
