11466,3283362,4,alexandrahauselmann,11/09/2023,"Magnificent place with a sumptuous sunset! On the other hand, there are a lot of people, some of whom arrive late in the evening and leave early in the morning, so it’s not always very calm! Very good to spend a night there."
11466,3263113,4,LaureAlain85,05/09/2023,Very quiet night and beautiful views
11466,3255723,3,Tx3mari,03/09/2023,"A very nice place with incredible views but I agree with the previous comment, people arriving very late at night which causes noise and in the middle of the night people arriving to party making noise with their cars with very loud exhaust pipes. This happened to us on the weekend, maybe during the week it will be quieter"
11466,3255484,3,PetitPossl21,03/09/2023,"A beautiful place, but unbearable due to campers coming and going until after midnight and also car drivers partying until the early hours of the morning."
11466,3240046,3,caddypunk,30/08/2023,"The place is nice but also overcrowded. The amount of vans, RVs, joggers, party kids and hikers is making it really hard to enjoy it."
11466,3239297,4,happyfamilyocean,30/08/2023,"Spectacular views of the town and Del Mar. It was very windy the night we stayed. Lots of tourists who only come down to take a photo at the viewpoint, so during the day there is a lot of traffic. Quiet at night, some come at the last minute. There are no services or garbage containers."
11466,3236921,3,emmeline72,30/08/2023,Exceptional view but the place is spoiled by the influx of campers in the middle of the night who do not respect the calm and tranquility of the place.
11466,3229851,5,fabiobognetti,28/08/2023,Beautiful view of the sea and the bay of Hondarribia. No services but lots of space and the road is paved and flat. Until 24.00 there was a lot of movement of cars and vans then the night was quiet.
11466,3222293,4,LauraJoan,26/08/2023,Spectacular views. The town is 15 minutes away. Recommendable!!!
11466,3210235,5,schnellerparker,24/08/2023,Beautiful place. View of the sea and a beautifully lit city. A lot of campers but also understandable for the beautiful place. More than 8 places. If it's foggy you have to be patient because it usually clears up in the evening.
11466,3190719,5,LLMYECA,20/08/2023,"Good place to spend the night, in summer you have to be lucky because there are few places. There are no services. But the area is very beautiful to spend the night and go hiking and cycling"
11466,3180554,5,ludovico_van,19/08/2023,"Wonderful parking in the middle of nature, a haven of peace where we spent a quiet night and discovered the surroundings thanks to the many paths. We recommend arriving early as the place is also frequented by many walkers. He doesn't pick up the phone."
11466,3179179,5,saramask,19/08/2023,"If you are lucky enough to find a place it really is a perfect place to stay. Fantastic view all around and pastures with horses, cows and sheep. There is a good coming and going of locals who come up to enjoy the view and who leave the place when they leave. We arrived around 6pm and there were still seats left."
11466,3159653,4,MerelFlorence,16/08/2023,"Beautiful, surrounded by horses, cow and sheep. But a campsite at night, with >30 vans close to each other. The problem of the high season I guess."
11466,3149786,4,miome,15/08/2023,"magnificent view, very good night on the other hand, a lot of comings and goings until late at night. lack of civility on the part of some so-called motorhomes (wild showers and vehicles that run for more than 45 minutes)"
11466,3140728,4,T1MPACT,13/08/2023,"Beautiful view. However, at the moment there are a lot of campers close together. But still nice place."
11466,3136511,5,estelamaria,13/08/2023,Very nice pitch. Quiet overnight. Highly recommended and worth seeing!!!
11466,3131561,5,FranMariscal,12/08/2023,"Beautiful place. very crowded You have to get there early to have a place, but it's worth it. There is grass and very nice views. Super recommended!!"
11466,3130920,5,frankineta,12/08/2023,"Spectacular place, on one side the city and on the other the sea. Super good to see the sunset. It has no services, a place that many people go. Go early in the afternoon. Pilgrims pass through in the morning, but it is worth spending a night here. super pretty!!"
11466,3117658,5,tomi17,10/08/2023,"Superb place with an incredible ocean view !! Lots of people, but it's still a great spot!!"
11466,3093449,5,CA71,07/08/2023,Top spot… you have to arrive early to have a good location. Magnificent view. By far the best spot in the area!
11466,3093076,5,Esiole09,07/08/2023,"very beautiful spot, be careful plan to arrive early because coveted spot. We had a very good night's sleep as an aunt, waking up to the sound of sheep bells. A sublime view of the sea and animal meadows. The parking lot was full that night. Bring sweaters and a blanket because it's windy. The network is not working very well"
11466,3074166,5,oscarvantrip,04/08/2023,"Spot with nice view. We spent the night here, it's very quiet."
11466,3057245,5,CPTNthreema,01/08/2023,"Magnificent view, super accessible. between the view of the sea, the city and the animals. Nice walk too. Big turnover between travelers and hikers. Quiet for the night we spent in a van."
11466,3038910,2,hebert.lae,29/07/2023,"Lots of people, noise only quiet between 2:30 and 6:30. So tight that the van next door hit us hard at 2 a.m., leaving a nice mark on my van! The worst spot for two years even if the view is beautiful."
11466,3037600,5,Edouards,29/07/2023,beautiful ocean view
11466,3035260,4,alexrun,28/07/2023,"Lots of people for an arrival at 11 p.m. but still a few places. The view is magnificent on one side or the other, between ruins and a small hiking path.."
11466,3033580,5,RafiRomane,28/07/2023,"A splendid view, on one side the ocean, on the other the coast. Grazing horses and cows, and ruins to complete the landscape. You can take a path a few hundred meters down to creeks and swim (2 hour hike there and back). Idyllic stop just a stone's throw from the border: not to be missed!"
11466,3026733,5,grollesc,26/07/2023,"A great place to sleep, with beautiful views. People walk and cycle by during the day as the road is good for cyclists."
11466,3020610,5,worekcementu,25/07/2023,Amazing place :) great view. Walk among sheep and wild horses. The changing weather plays out a real spectacle on the ocean. I recommend to everyone :)
11466,3016253,5,TadeEikeAnna,25/07/2023,"Very nice place. We stood here for one night and enjoyed the great view. If you get there early, you can still be in the first row. We were woken up idyllically by the sheep in the morning. There are no sanitary facilities and no garbage cans."
11466,3008550,5,LaureS31,23/07/2023,"We spent one night there. We have a very nice view of the bay of Hendaye on one side and the ocean on the other. Our son was delighted to see the sheep and horses in the fields next door. Don't arrive too late because this car park fills up quickly but it's generally quiet, except for a car and a motorbike that exchanged who knows what for 15min at 2am"
11466,2991571,5,Mira2804,20/07/2023,Nice place on a mountain. Great sunset view. In addition to horses and sheep.
11466,2979277,4,BlauwBus,17/07/2023,"Beautiful place, especially at sunset!"
11466,2968862,5,josefinehoey,15/07/2023,extraordinary views to wake up to. many campers here in the summer so do not show up too late. very peaceful and family friendly as well.
11466,2964091,5,arguez14,14/07/2023,We loved it! The views of the sea and nature are impressive.
11466,2951739,2,arnaudleslie,11/07/2023,"It's not bad for a well-insulated motorhome, for vans it's hell. Constant passage, noisy junkies… no peace. We left during the evening on a spot a little further. Despite this, the view is 360."
11466,2948654,5,rubenYtania,11/07/2023,Extraordinary site with views!! To repeat!! Among all the vanlifers we have to take care of these sites. Park well and respect everyone! I was lucky enough to sleep one night there!
11466,2946551,5,Dirck,10/07/2023,"No facilities, weak 4G, but otherwise everything a motor home owner wants: tranquility, a view, animals, ... TOP LOCATION"
11466,2940527,4,martinsltopf,09/07/2023,Extraordinary views! A lot of traffic in and out though.
11466,2934449,1,jodelparker,07/07/2023,"In itself a great place. But: Unfortunately, some of our fellow human beings have not understood the meaning of being free. Tables and chairs stood in front of and next to the campers, some spread out extra wide. Space was only reluctantly made, but the other neighbor shaking his head that we were standing too close on them encouraged us to drive away. Keep it up and the seats will be banned!!"
11466,2930597,3,Craigy24,06/07/2023,"I stayed here on a Sunday night In early May. Some fool arrived around 12am blasting music, a good quality system by god it was loud, they finally left around 2am. 
Anyway, a rather public large busy carpark nothing to get excited about for me."
11466,2925576,5,onlylocals,05/07/2023,"AMAZING site. Lots of people pulling chairs and tables outside. Please, we will respect and only spend the night, CAMPING IS PROHIBITED. If we continue with this behavior they will end up closing it. The sunset looks amazing."
11466,2913098,5,elilore,01/07/2023,From 7/1/23 to 7/3/23 it is not accessible by road. Cut by the tour de France. The police send us to the Higuer lighthouse. Although we have seen that the site is beautiful
11466,2862883,5,Oreli35,17/06/2023,Magnificent view... 1 mountain side and 1 sea side. Good start for hiking. Fairly quiet at night.
11466,2844437,5,RUMOJOIA,11/06/2023,Simply fantastic place but note that on weekends it gets very crowded and consequently rude people leave their garbage!
11466,2839733,5,sofiaandstephen,10/06/2023,"Wonderful place, realitive flat parking, and spectacular views. We stayed one night extra just because of how great it was. We hiked around the mountains and enjoyed the view. However the first night a horse woke us up when scratching himself on our van. And on Friday evening there were some sort of “race car-meet-up” but they left after a couple of hours and did not disturb during the night."
11466,2806071,5,zofe,31/05/2023,"Incredibly beautiful. Road up is adventurous but well possible, watch out for cyclists. Lots of campers on site but extremely quiet at night. Note, however, that there's no mobile phone reception at all (neither Spanish nor French network with Vodafone)."
11466,2790421,4,Cocretina,27/05/2023,"The best views, amazing! The parking area is very good, without unevenness or anything. There are no toilets or garbage cans. A lot of people arrived until 12 at night, then it was quiet."
11466,2789828,4,lhartwig,27/05/2023,"The view in both directions is incredibly beautiful, great sunset, only on weekends there is a loud party until 03:00 at night."
11466,2789116,5,srtaelido,26/05/2023,"As soon as I arrived I fell in love with the peace that is breathed. Until cars began to arrive and more came and went and so on until dinner time. To sleep super peacefully, in the morning you wake up with all the horses in front of you, sheep go by and you can see all of Hondarribia. A lot of people come from 09:30 to go hiking but it didn't bother us at all."
11466,2788615,5,herve.galaxy,26/05/2023,Very busy but great place.
11466,2766432,5,lifeISlive,20/05/2023,"Superb place with an excellent view and we were not even allowed to see some animals near us (horse, sheep, cow). Try to come happy because the parking lot fills up quickly with other campers."
11466,2763888,5,RubenDom,19/05/2023,Very nice place!! Too bad the wind and the rain didn't let us sleep and at midnight we had to go down to Hondarriba to rest
11466,2737928,5,clau2000,09/05/2023,"Very quiet night in a privileged place with a panoramic view of almost 360 degrees. Surrounded by cows, sheep and horses. It would be nice if there were bins and tables, everything else was perfect."
11466,2731884,5,billyaline8572,07/05/2023,"Incredible spot, with an incredible view! Very quiet to spend the night there, the parking lot was almost full with Camper vans for the night. A lot of people come to visit the place and go hiking. Some mountain road to get there (500m drop) We recommend 100%!"
11466,2713685,5,cragajo,01/05/2023,The views are incredible and at night the parking lot is left only with vans and caravans very quiet. In the morning we were lucky to see about 15 griffon vultures just a few meters from the ground (there was a poor dead foal). Awesome!
11466,2659193,4,Rebecadela,10/04/2023,"A good place to spend a quiet night with incredible views. During the day it is usually a bit crowded since many people go up to visit the place since it has places of interest and hiking trails, but it is fast, they usually leave immediately, so it will not be difficult for you to park."
11466,2653813,5,andreaf772,09/04/2023,An amazing site! One of the best we've been to. The sunset here is beautiful. We spent the night and everything was great. We recommend it 100%
11466,2645397,5,stefitrenco,07/04/2023,"The impressive views, I recommend arriving at sunset and watching the sun go down. When we arrived there were a lot of people but then there was a gap because there were cars that went up just to see the views. In the morning the panorama is also beautiful. Despite the fact that there were many people, we slept very well and without noise."
11466,2631118,5,Sterhd,30/03/2023,"We had a wonderful night here. The view is beautiful. And yes, motorcyclists come together to chat and talk about their common hobby. We also ride motorcycles and know that being together is a social affair. Respect each other and then everything will be fine, including your stay in this beautiful place in Spain."
11466,2625920,4,moritzkaden,26/03/2023,"Good pitch to spend 1 night in the mountains of Spain. We found out through hiking that there is a much better parking spot further up the mountain. This is also entered on Park4Night. Unfortunately, there is a lot going on in this parking lot. In the evening, motorcyclists or tuners come from time to time. They are there for 10-20 minutes and unfortunately a bit louder during that time. But at night it is quiet."
11466,2613787,4,Iloulecepe12,18/03/2023,beautiful place and quiet most of the time. there are indeed tunning kekes who come to do handbrakes in the evening even on weekdays.
11466,2589088,4,ludo7731,24/02/2023,great view lots of space. one star less because of the wind and drifts in the early evening.
11466,2580997,5,Le_Fouts,17/02/2023,"very good spot, beautiful 360 degree view, can be windy!"
11466,2564156,5,kinnu,30/01/2023,"The view is beautiful! Nice walks around with animals! I spent a night, nice and quiet, definitely I will come back here!"
11466,2556924,4,SusiRobbi,21/01/2023,Great view and paved driveway (no mud hole in January)
11466,2549860,5,ManniMaster,12/01/2023,One of the most beautiful places during our trip. For overnight stays or as a stopover. You can walk a good distance across the meadow. Great view. Free running horses. Just beautiful!
11466,2539125,5,vanlifelina,03/01/2023,Amazing view and quite sleeping (if there’s no wind ) but the road to that carpark is fairly steep
11466,2524166,5,matopi,18/12/2022,Good place to spend the night with nice views. It has no services.
11466,2519710,4,rachelpitard,11/12/2022,The view is really magnificent but it is very crowded even out of season (December). Lots of comings and goings late at night and early in the morning. But otherwise the spot is really worth it for one night
11466,2503888,5,celiwak,23/11/2022,Very nice spot! A magnificent view and surrounded by Basque horses.
11466,2493669,4,ingewikkeld92,13/11/2022,"Beautiful spot with gorgeous views. In the weekend it was too crowded with vans, motor homes and day visitors, but it’s like that in most good parkings. A French lady yelled at me when trying to park next to her giant motorhome.. In the week it was supposedly perfect. Only minus is that it’s next to a road. Not many cars, but I wouldn’t let my dog out of sight. Phone reception only at viewpoint."
11466,2490588,5,JandEvB,11/11/2022,Such an amazing and dreamy place. A great location to start your hikes through the area and to watch sunset and sunrise! we stayed here for 3 days.
11466,2489818,5,metjimmyoppad,10/11/2022,perfect place. start of long walking tours 'dont bring granny'. in the middle of horse landscape. stood 3 nights. 4-6 different other smaller camp.buses every night. no water (but down at the church).
11466,2484363,5,karolinabertram,06/11/2022,"Wow, wow, wow!! This place is incredibly beautiful!! Quiet night, and fantastic nature experience! Unfortunately, no trash cans"
11466,2475289,4,Rob923,31/10/2022,"Beautiful view. The parking lot is very busy, there were about 7 campers with us and several came and left again. The parking lot is also heavily frequented by tourists, who come, take a picture and jet off again. Unfortunately no rubbish bins, which is probably why there was some rubbish lying around."
11466,2466408,4,valcampan,28/10/2022,night lulled by the wind... superb sunrise over the Rhune. We will come back to it.
11466,2448680,5,fbonifacio91,17/10/2022,"Incredible place to spend the night, on one side the sea to the other mountain."
11466,2439743,4,jray,12/10/2022,"Very good place for one night. Okay, we were in the fog but it's the season that wants that"
11466,2435722,5,RaquelLima,10/10/2022,"Amazing spot!! Stayed for a night, along with some other vans. There are horses walking around in the parking, super friendly. Great views, the sea in one side, the mountains on the other.
Touristic buses stop by and in the morning people were cutting the grass, but didnt bother. To be back!"
11466,2422012,5,melaniecedric,04/10/2022,"We are early October, a bit crowded but very reasonable. The sunset is magnificent, the landscape and the view at the top. The ground is practically flat. There are horses and sheep nearby. Location at the top. Thank you for giving us this access and let's keep it clean above all. peaceful night"
11466,2403489,5,fatbellysakura,25/09/2022,"Absolutely breath taking views. I visited right after the high season so there were a lot of visitors, but not over crowded. Once the sun set wanderers left and it was very peaceful with the other campers around. I will warn you to search the parking lot near the 4th tower and not use the address here. The address listed took me on a dirt hiking trail! This location is right on the driving path."
11466,2400285,3,park4nite5156,24/09/2022,"great view and paved ground but not quiet at all before 1:30 a.m. because of the comings and goings of people in cars and late arrivals (noise of engines, slamming doors,...). good for lunch or dinner but not for sleeping"
11466,2392690,3,SpicyCampers,22/09/2022,"Beautiful place, lots of other vanlifers. Noise from young people (loud music and fireworks) until late at night. They left around half past one in the night. After that it was a quiet night."
11466,2379690,5,pazule10,17/09/2022,"The best parking lot in the Basque Country, shitheads."
11466,2370409,5,juliahuber,14/09/2022,"Beautiful place for 1-3 nights. Ideal with a dog, beautiful walks in front of the door! Great sunset and rise!"
11466,2366015,5,Loaded_bhangra,12/09/2022,beautiful sunrise and sunset! stayed there for 2 nights. There is always something going on there.
11466,2364960,5,jaimevamarta,12/09/2022,Gratuitous. We stayed the night of August 4-5 and loved it. Before dinner we witnessed an amazing sunset. It has views of the sea and Hondarribia. You can go hiking or rest. Site for about 14 motorhomes. Quiet and clean. There are no services but ideal for sleeping.
11466,2328319,3,malouelfriede,01/09/2022,"Drove up the mountain in the evening around 21:30, in the dark. already kind of creepy and the higher we got there was thick fog. Couldnt see in front or back..random cars stopped on the side of the road & coming down. We never arrived at the spot, because we got scared and turned back after 10 minutes. There was a speedlimit sign on our way back with: DALE GAS! ‘Give gas’ in Spanish. Like: RUN!"
11466,2308601,4,elhinchon,27/08/2022,"excellent views! The pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago pass through there, we have spent a quiet night, bear in mind that young people usually go by car at night, we have had a rainy night and still they have gone, respectful without noise, but I imagine that in a cool summer night without rain there can be a bottle... without services!"
11466,2300224,4,van_142_,25/08/2022,"Incredibly views, it's definitely worth to go even if not spending the night. We parked there for a few hours at the end of the day, when the sun set, it was really windy so we did not feel confortable and we left."
11466,2287424,5,medusavan,22/08/2022,"Perfect place, there is no garbage, it is recommended to keep the place clean among all. Respect between campers and visitors to the place. Animals around, perfect views, sunrise and sunset. Sea and mountains on both sides. We will be back, we love it"
11466,2286215,4,mfp66,22/08/2022,Very nice point of view. Many come and go in the evening to see the sunset. No trash so dirty.
11466,2279499,5,HannahAnger,21/08/2022,beautiful view over the sea and the mountains! enough space for at least 20 campers. stayed there for 2 nights. I would highly recommend this place :)
11466,2251902,4,robinfamily15,16/08/2022,"Great spot, only downside the dirty people who leave the pq everywhere on such a beautiful place"
11466,2218210,1,romain.mercurol,11/08/2022,"A taste of hell! Far West atmosphere, locals tumbling out loud music, at 3 a.m. to do who knows what in the parking lot, with full headlights (I think the idea is clearly to scare vanlifers away)… For 4 years we traveling with my partner, we had never seen that, as said below in the comments, we had to do with the worst of the vanlifers: no respect for the others, it speaks loudly until no time, it is the mess..."
11466,2216870,4,Frank90,11/08/2022,"A nice place for one night. However, it is very crowded for the sunset and there is a lot of rubbish and toilet paper lying around. But we had a very quiet and comfortable night in our car and will definitely come back."
11466,2215004,4,arcomusic,11/08/2022,Beautiful place! Fairly busy and at night some partying young people but the view makes you forget this.
11466,2188652,3,KangooroGZ,07/08/2022,Overcrowded they will not see.
11466,2183237,3,MoniRoterBus,06/08/2022,Pretty crowded and unfortunately no view in bad weather. A bin or two would certainly help keep the place clean as there are also many day trippers coming and there are clear toilet signs in many of the bushes.
11466,2176783,5,bsado,05/08/2022,A bit dirty but quiet and great views.
11466,2172554,3,Bivouac44,04/08/2022,"Flat pitches, very busy and without service. Superb views of the French and Spanish Basque coasts. Ocean as far as the eye can see. Quiet night."
11466,2168519,5,montseguix,03/08/2022,During the day there is a lot of movement of cars that come for a walk or to enjoy the viewpoint but everything is quiet. At night maximum tranquility and spectacular views. The sheep wake you up. There are no services. On the way up we have seen other points where you can stop that would also be a good solution if it is full.
11466,2154053,4,AS095,31/07/2022,Slept here a week ago. It was very busy with people who also came to spend the night and watch the sunset. Nice view.
11466,2151661,3,larulietta44,31/07/2022,"Spot with a very beautiful view, you can admire the sunset! However, this spot stops there. The place is simply disgusting and not respected... The floor is littered with waste and soiled toilet paper. It's frankly unacceptable and saddening to see that... Vanlife begins with respect for nature!"
11466,2140301,4,mathouvan,29/07/2022,"great view, setting, between sea, mountain, horses and sheep it's a great place. perfect for watching the sunset. nevertheless, that's what attracts a lot of people, not a lot of privacy between all the vans glued to each other."
11466,2121036,5,lenipark17,25/07/2022,"Wow. Beautiful pitch! The view is unique. Great environment with lots of nature. The sheep, horses and cows make everything even more idyllic. We stay one night with 8 other campers. The car park is popular and busy but doesn't bother. We would always come back!"
11466,2113447,4,zucche,23/07/2022,"Very beautiful place. Incredible views, but you have to be lucky to find a parking space"

11466,2028680,5,Frau-Hort,01/07/2022,"Spent one night here (26-27/06). It was great with a sea view and a view of Irun. Sheep in the evening, horses and cows in the morning. No toilets. Keep the place clean."
11466,2025557,5,kaydeeshep,30/06/2022,Slept well here- a lot of campers and a few cars pulling in to see the view but to be expected in a place like this- it didn’t disturb us! Beautiful view of the sea
11466,2010768,5,LauraMeltzer,25/06/2022,"Very quiet place, although constant tourist traffic during the day, but absolutely deserted at night. Currently less space because there is a construction site in the parking lot. Spectacular view and beautiful walking and hiking opportunities directly from the site."
11466,1944111,2,Mirtillo,04/06/2022,"Really nice but TOO MUCH NOISE. People come here during night to enjoy the view and the place and they stay until late at night talking etc., and in the morning turists come so it’s not really a calm place. Really hard for me to fall asleep and in the morning the turist voices woke me up..."

11466,1897684,4,CycyetRiri,18/05/2022,"A great place to spend a night and wake up in the early morning with a wonderful view. Very nice hikes to do not far away as well. Only downside, in the evening the place is popular with some crazy drivers.."
11466,1873463,5,RamS.,06/05/2022,"Great place for one night. Very good for hiking. Unfortunately, it was foggy for us the whole time, which is why we were unfortunately not allowed to enjoy the certainly very beautiful view. At the moment construction work is taking place upstairs, but it didn't bother us at all. We were a total of 7 vehicles upstairs."
11466,1860910,5,Banksyontour,30/04/2022,"Loved it, so quiet! But still, lots of cars and hikers. Easy access for any size vehicle. Very bad phone signal!"

11466,1829862,5,raquel_1999,17/04/2022,"Quite spacious and very quiet place. Access to the site is via a twisty winding road, but it's well worth it. Spectacular views of the sea, we could not appreciate it, since at this time of year there is a lot of fog. For everything else perfect!"
11466,1827079,5,DaveNL,16/04/2022,"My first stop in Spain. stayed for 2 nights without problems. magical view, a ruine uphill, some sheep walking around, and again a magical view! no facilities"

11466,1793327,5,Medley,24/03/2022,"Nice view between sea and mountains, free herds along the road. A few comings and goings in the evening but a calm night. Number of places varies according to the length of the vehicles and their parking."
11466,1778797,5,camimi,10/03/2022,"Caution! Since this morning there has been construction work that is very noisy and there are large vehicles and machines around. Otherwise beautiful, we had two nice days"
11466,1776897,5,tonibaker,07/03/2022,"Beautiful spot, we spent 3 nights undisturbed. It was sunny the first two days but then thick fog rolled in and we didn’t fancy driving the winding mountain roads in the fog. Great hiking immediately from the car park. We saw a flock of 15 vultures and little lizards sunning themselves on the wall. There are no bins at all or any other services."
11466,1774156,3,lp.travel,05/03/2022,"Very nice location facing the sea with free-roaming horses and vultures flying nearby. It would be perfect if many motorists didn't turn in circles in the middle of the parking lot, revving their engines until 3 a.m., the music blaring and shouting as loud as possible in order to wake people up and scare the horses! No network."
11466,1750223,4,Vivarobic,07/02/2022,"February 6, 2022, 6 p.m. installed beautiful view, but still winter and night extremely strong wind from the sea."

11466,1707515,5,Mintxu,10/12/2021,"Whenever we enter through France or are in the area, we stop here and it always surprises us. For the views, for the place and ... for the atmosphere. Sometimes on the verge of having no place because it fills up."
11466,1695462,4,raquelilla08,22/11/2021,"We have spent the night of 11/19, there were quite a few ACs and campers. There are no services but the views are incredible, it is recommended to watch the sunset. At midnight some cars came but they didn't bother much."

11466,1665538,4,travel_bnmr,28/10/2021,"Nice busy place with great view. Very busy with campers but also many cars and coaches. Poor reception of 4g or even 3g, this can be solved by manually selecting a Spanish network on your phone."
11466,1661075,4,scalp007,25/10/2021,"Nice view, arriving around 7.15pm there were still a lot of people but then the cars left the site at nightfall then it was calm ... until the sun came back when the cars came back!"

11466,1630510,3,rkd,06/10/2021,"During the day, the many short-term visitors who keep coming and going are annoying. Otherwise wonderful to stay overnight."
11466,1613787,4,DerSchmiedAusH,28/09/2021,"Great view and a small hiking trail up to the mountain, horses and sheep in addition. Were here from Saturday to Sunday, everything was full but quiet, many van-lifers there."
11466,1612537,5,flo1310,27/09/2021,Beautiful view! Next to the parking lot are sheep and horses. It can be loud and stormy at night.

11466,1585456,5,mmmiranda,17/09/2021,Incredible both to see the dusk and the sunrise. I have loved sleeping here.
11466,1582333,5,Jean-Phy62,16/09/2021,"Super calm and beautiful view. Walk on foot, the road to Saint Jacques de Compostela. But even out of season there are people. 15 motorhomes this day."
11466,1574232,5,AchimSchaefer,13/09/2021,"Beware, if the path seems highly adventurous to the mountain, then you are on the wrong side of the mountain. At the back there is a real road up the mountain. Definitely worth the drive. Wonderful all-round view, great sunset and an even more beautiful sunrise. A must for one night."
11466,1573992,5,manelpm,13/09/2021,Super recommended to spend the night. Very quiet night.
11466,1560587,4,antoucan,08/09/2021,"The extraordinary views. It fills up pretty quickly, so if you're late you may not find a place. By sunset it was full of people, but it started to rain and a lot of people left, and those of us who stayed to sleep, we got inside. Even so, some foreigner with a motorhome made a lot of noise around there at 1 in the morning, we had to silence them. Recommended site !!"
11466,1555505,5,Scrud,07/09/2021,"Incredible site, with spectacular views of the ocean and Hondarribia. Until 23:00 there are young people making a bottle and making noises, then very quiet."
11466,1541204,5,JenniferGrdt,02/09/2021,Super quiet place with a 360 view between ocean and mountain. Plan to arrive not too late because quickly stormed (CC vans) for the night. A trash can is available but no other amenities. Very quiet awakening too. I recommend
11466,1527859,4,EGS,29/08/2021,"Super place, with spectacular views. Flat squares. Very crowded all day, occupying all the squares at night. No services. Quite noisy at night, there were people talking quite loudly until late, then it started to rain and it was quite quiet."
11466,1526976,5,oriolrue,29/08/2021,"Perfect place without services, very spacious to arrive with large vehicles. There is little coverage, at the viewpoint there is but very little in the parking lot. We slept a lot in vans and AC. quiet place without noise. Beautiful sunrise with the horses."
11466,1507172,4,YannT,24/08/2021,Location 10/10 but really overcrowded. 30 campers yesterday with another 10-15 who turned around because they did not find any space.
11466,1500495,4,Stephencluzel,23/08/2021,Great place in the middle of nature with horses and sheep. the view is extra on the ocean by cons very popular with locals
11466,1470412,5,longlivelandy,17/08/2021,"Nice spot! On top of a hill, surrounded by nature, horses and sheeps. Great view!! Lots of other vans. No toilets and very windy. Would definatly recommend to stay there for a night!"
11466,1460206,4,gaetaneeche,15/08/2021,"The site is magnificent, with 360 degree views, easily accessible by road (beware there are a lot of cyclists!), We arrived around 6.30 p.m., there was still a lot of space but when we woke up the campsite was full of vans / motorhome. Young people partied until late, it's not the quietest spot you'll find."
11466,1446943,5,llunadana,12/08/2021,Fantastic place let's take care of it
11466,1441067,4,AlexBD,11/08/2021,"Beautiful place to sleep and watch the sunset. Surrounded all by countryside, full of sheep, horses and cows. There's not a lot of coverage so great to (un) connect. Please, PARK AS YOU PLAY, leave places for everyone, as it gets quite crowded and more than one standing horizontally."
11466,1413379,4,senaeynur,06/08/2021,The view was amazing! You woke up with horses and sheeps in front of you. But it was so crowded. Maybe 20 campers. We were here in august and it was too windy that we couldn't stay outside much. And another problem is there was a very weak signal and roaming problem (if you say it is a problem).
11466,1398864,4,sportyvanlife,03/08/2021,"Beautiful view, very nice waking up. Unfortunately there was a lot of waste and we had some problems with noisy people."
11466,1392537,5,Pradoypope,01/08/2021,"Idyllic place to spend the night or the day, with stunning views. It is advisable to arrive just before sunset, from here it is spectacular."
11466,1383672,5,flobom,30/07/2021,"Superb view, a few vans but quiet night with sunset over the infinite ocean .. and the tinkling of sheep bells"

11466,1371055,5,Miryam2,27/07/2021,"Lookout. Magnificent views at the top of the mountain to the sea and Hondarribia. Ideal for spending a day, hiking and enjoying the sunset. Large CVs can arrive from Hondarribia and spend the night. There are no services. We arrived at noon and there were quite a few places."
11466,1370158,5,agoneymayber,27/07/2021,"Great place to spend the night about 15-20 minutes from Hondarribia, surrounded by nature and to visit Mount Jaizkibel. Spectacular sunset. Quite a lot of car movement during the late afternoon but very quiet at night. We went up at around 8pm and had no problem getting a seat. Totally recommended."
11466,1365910,5,estebanj,26/07/2021,"Spectacular. Incredible views of both the sea and Hondarribia and France. You have to go up from Hondarribia 9km along a winding road. If you arrive early there are vehicles that come to spend the afternoon, to seek privacy or to drink while watching the sunset. After sunset they leave. The place is dirty and full of cans, but that doesn't take away from its enormous beauty. The sheep wake you up in the morning."
11466,1365470,5,LenaWoess,26/07/2021,A very nice view! We were there on Sundays and arrived at around 9 p.m. when the parking lot was already quite full.
11466,1342532,5,queencamila,20/07/2021,The view is beautiful! Definitely recommended. We arrived at 1pm and it was empty. Starting from 5pm it gets completely full since a lot of people come to see the sunset. If you want to spend the night better to come early or late. There’s a lot of people coming and going during the day. Big trash bin available.
11466,1323003,5,victor.alcazar,14/07/2021,I went on a Monday and he slept great. No noise and with views of the sea. Excellent option to spend the night.

11466,1282703,4,Audreyjeremy974,28/06/2021,"Flat car park with very good view from both sides, away from the city. No service, only garbage cans. We have not found better in the area."
11466,1281228,4,Lauracali,27/06/2021,A little uneven but incredible views and quite quiet. There are many mountain bike and hiking trails. Without any service.
11466,1263236,4,Frost_Viking,19/06/2021,"Beautiful place, with great views, the only negative point is the weekends that a lot of children go to play the idiot with the car, thank goodness that when it got dark they left and we could sleep great."
11466,1251320,4,eaglewings,12/06/2021,"Beautiful but very busy. We ourselves have a cozy T3 as in the picture. However, it was full of about 25 Tupperware bins."
11466,1245505,4,neuner1,09/06/2021,"Nice parking lot with a view of the sea and the city on the other side. Unfortunately, the weather thwarted our plans and it was very cloudy and foggy. It was a bit stormy at night and one or two mysterious cars were in the parking lot until midnight. The rest of the night was very quiet. When the weather is great, it is definitely one of the most beautiful places."
11466,1243455,5,cml46,08/06/2021,"Great place, spectacular views, tranquility and peace. our 7.5m AC without problems. 100% recommendable. fantastic sunset. without water services or bathrooms."

11466,1168399,1,Amaiabidaian,05/04/2021,"Making a route throughout the Basque Country on Thursday we decided to spend the night here, it was full and we were lucky enough to park. Around 3 and a little in the morning the couple in the red car next door began to talk about it as if they were rabbits for at least an hour and when things calmed down for a few minutes they came back again later. They would have a good time but we couldn't sleep after that."
11466,1160537,4,Josetxu.1,29/03/2021,Spectacular site without any service. Incredible views ... But as the wind blows you do not sleep all night

11466,1076375,5,digitaldesignnomad,30/09/2020,"Great place and beautiful view! Unfortunately, it only rained during the night and clouds came up so that everything was still foggy when we left and we couldn't enjoy any view. But nice quiet place for a night or two. Very busy during the day!"
11466,1069720,4,cawotte83,25/09/2020,"No doubt breathtaking view but we were in bad weather, rain wind fog. The night was still good. We were between 6/7 vans / cc. A trash can present do not park in front because the garbage truck which passes around 9 / 10pm is doing its maneuver and therefore you could be in the way."
11466,1061323,4,AndreNut,20/09/2020,"We stayed 4 nights ago and it was a very quiet night. There were more vans, all very respectful. The amazing views, a lot of peace and in the morning cows, horses come to wake you up ... Recommended"

11466,1057967,2,tipsontheroad2,19/09/2020,"Superb place with breathtaking views BUT on a Friday evening it is the kingdom of kéké tuning until no time. They do vroom vroom with their cars and are violent (one of them pretended to run into me). Around 3 am it is the parade of dealers. Police raid, with search and all the hoopla in the parking lot. Shit night"
11466,1050355,5,LESDUFF,15/09/2020,"Excellent point of view! Quiet night! 17 km of passes to climb if you do both sides! Great ! Out of season and weekends, it's the best!"

We arrived here late in the evening and were surprised by the beautiful view, both in the evening and when we woke up in the morning! There are many walkers, cyclists and runners. In the morning you can take a nice walk on the mountain top. Recommended!"
11466,928463,4,afdeudero,04/08/2020,"Magnificent views, unbeatable surroundings. The only flaw is that it is seen that a common place where young people go to drink until 2-3 in the morning."
11466,916042,4,flashontheroad,31/07/2020,"Site with several places and quite flat, it has very good views and a beautiful sunset. It is quite isolated from the city, but it is very crowded at sunset. It was also our turn that some kids arrived to party and until 1:30 they did not leave, but removing that very well."
11466,884125,5,NanaK,20/07/2020,"A summit offering a panoramic view of the mountains and the sea with its magnificent horses and sheep! A lot of people at the end of the evening but everyone attends the sunset and leaves. Good spirit van and CC. Once the sun has gone down the cool quickly falls, only one downside, no trash can therefore quite dirty in places (PQ lying around and butts / packaging everywhere)."

11471,3254845,5,tlayher,03/09/2023,"Great sanitary facilities, very clean, nice pool, very nice and helpful staff. 30 minutes to Ronda on foot, sidewalk available."
11471,3240415,4,huebnet,31/08/2023,"Very large, level spaces, super nice receptionist, great swimming pool, lots of leisure activities, space very lovingly designed. The hit in August 2023: the kittens and the free-roaming rabbits. One point deducted because my son almost scalded himself in the cold shower and because after one night all the women's toilets were dirty with feces and were cleaned very late."
11471,3239328,5,Bastienvozelle,30/08/2023,"Very good, clean campsite and very pleasant staff. Everything is on site for camper vans! Very good, spacious pitches, clean toilets, pleasant swimming pool."

11471,3217551,5,juillard,25/08/2023,"A welcome at the top and in French by Carmen and her colleague. Size of the large and shaded pitches, very pleasant swimming pool with greenery and shade. The visit of the beautiful city of Ronda can be done on foot from the campsite in 20 minutes (provide water if it is hot!)."
11471,3200510,5,sonnita186,22/08/2023,"I loved this campsite. I would spend a season again. We only stayed one night but we thought it was great. Very new and clean facilities. Super pool and playground. The park is a bit dangerous for a 2-year-old child and needs supervision, but with more age it's great. The old town is a 15-20 minute walk with a sidewalk. Magnificent!!"
11471,3166670,5,skippy33,17/08/2023,"Great place to unwind. The welcome is great, the swimming pool very pleasant in these high temperatures."
11471,3094645,5,Atlas91,07/08/2023,Great campsite. Clean and quiet. Nice swimming pool. Warm and pleasant welcome. Perfect for visiting Ronda and its pretty region.

11471,3035229,5,krapodebo,28/07/2023,"Very nice campsite with a beautiful swimming pool next to a magnificent town. The sanitary facilities are very clean as well as the campsite in general. The 2 women at the reception are adorable and very helpful. No complaints. €44 per night for 3 adults (including 1 teenager) and 1 child with electricity. considering the benefits, it is not very expensive."
11471,3004709,5,ndr89,23/07/2023,"July 2023 2 adults and pitch with electricity 33€/night. nice campsite with all services and beautiful swimming pool. clean bathrooms and well done camper service. from the same street, if you want, there is the pedestrian that takes you to the center in 20/30 minutes. so far one two best!"
11471,2935954,5,lesfilmu,08/07/2023,"Very nice campsite, all pitches are level and large enough with a stabilized sand floor of very good quality. The reception is very pleasant, sanitary facilities very clean and spacious. Nice swimming pool with quality sun loungers. The restaurant is very good and relatively inexpensive. On foot 20 minutes from old Ronda. I recommend."
11471,2921908,5,ParentsVoyageurs,04/07/2023,"Great campsite! We went there at the beginning of July and there were very few people. The rules are respected, so it is very quiet in the evening. For children there is a giant chess game, park, ping pong and mini golf! The bathrooms are immaculate! The welcome is incredible! Nothing to say it was perfect"
11471,2882283,5,msbulli,22/06/2023,"Organization, location for Ronda visit, cleanliness perfect."
11471,2857808,5,MJPp4n,15/06/2023,"5 star facilities, English speaking friendly staff, only downside is that we were given a gravel pitch to pitch our tent and without a use of a jackhammer it was impossible to insert any pegs. Other than that ample pitch."
11471,2854208,5,Rocketvancamper,14/06/2023,"One of the best CP's we've ever stayed at. Great gravel terrace pitches, some with good shade. Everything easily accessible. Clean sanitary facilities. Great pool. Clever solution is a large passage to gray water, toilet emptying and water supply. The historic part of Ronda can be easily reached on foot in about 20 minutes. The service/reception incredibly friendly and helpful. Also German speaking. Can only recommend."
11471,2843093,5,Jimmy6868,11/06/2023,"Good, beautiful, manageable, terraced CP, good sanitary facilities, very friendly staff. Gravel pitches, Ronda easily accessible on foot or by bike."
11471,2833315,5,tassietravelers,08/06/2023,"One of the best places we’ve stayed. Good sites, easy to access. Clean facilities. Great pool. And they’ve thought through how to provide services - drive through grey water, toilet emptying and water supply. Pleasant walk past olive groves into town (& at the right side of town to visit the historic centre and see the gorge). Recommended"
11471,2820650,4,robinundlina,04/06/2023,Nice campsite. Way to Ronda on foot or by car easily feasible. Staff friendly and sanitary impeccable. Only the wifi could be better.
11471,2773858,4,Haddock4485,21/05/2023,"Magnificent terraced campsite. Very nice swimming pool. Very clean toilets. The price is a bit random if you pay in cash, if you stay more than three days, if you are ACSI, discounts. Paid per day €24 instead of €30. There is the motorhome area next door, managed by the campsite, which is much cheaper. And that is also very good."
11471,2773072,5,vanlife1409,21/05/2023,Very nice campsite. All clean. Nice pitches. Pleasant. Quiet.

11471,2754967,5,Den_Twan,16/05/2023,"Very friendly welcome, she told me that she likes to receive Belgian guests ;) The swimming pool is open and with a beautiful view. The pitches are shady and tidy (leveling is necessary). Ideal place for a visit to the beautiful Ronda. Just sanitary and hot shower. Stayed here for 2 nights and couldn't fault it. Highly recommended"

11471,2726935,5,lelecaporal,06/05/2023,excellent campsite a few km from Ronda and 20 from SETENIL de LAS Bodegas. Clean bathrooms all new. Cold water pool. there is a restaurant if you want a camper for 2 people with electricity for 33 euros
11471,2719177,5,vantrotters360,03/05/2023,"Perfect, open swimming pool, clean sanitary facilities, hot water for dishes, mini golf, games, table tennis, calm. One of the most beautiful campsites in Andalusia for €35 van, 4 people."
11471,2706758,5,Hxpfner,29/04/2023,"Good campsite with good facilities. The front desk is very friendly, even speaks relatively good German. Depending on the vehicle, the pitches are spacious and level. Gravel pitches, some with trees and shade. Sanitary facilities are neat and clean. Contrary to previous comments...the pool is open (11:00 - 19:00). 1 night, 2 people without electricity for VW Bulli - 24€ is ok. Recommendation"
11471,2702963,4,BduS,28/04/2023,A nice campsite. Fully equipped. Sanitary facilities in several places. It is modern and very clean. The pitches are spacious and reasonably level. The reception was quite businesslike and very assembly line work. Booking in advance is not possible. The swimming pool is and will remain closed until June despite the heat wave. The restaurant in front of the campsite is good. Portions can be large. Ronda is 1.8 km away.
11471,2698794,5,DavoWalkabout,26/04/2023,"Best van sanitary, grey water, chemical toilet and clean blue water area. Flat shady pitches, nice location just out of town (15 walk/8 bike) good shower block and nice bar/ restaurant, a fantastic site."
11471,2692923,4,campercorry,24/04/2023,"Neat campsite with a wonderful restaurant! Fresh bread in the morning and neat sanitary facilities with hot water. Washing machine works well, dryer a little less. Nice playground for small children. Swimming pool was not open yet at the end of March. Ronda is easy to reach both on foot and by bike, a nice town for a few days. We were on the campsite but there is also a camper place."
11471,2690143,5,Saskia0812,23/04/2023,"Very nice location. We stood here more accidentally, not realizing that right next door is the pitch managed by the same reception. Not so much space to park in front of the reception or it was just a lot going on with us at the time."
11471,2686004,4,ChrisGew,21/04/2023,"Good location for walking into town. Value for money. All clean. Unfortunately, some of the parking spaces are quite open, which makes it look like a parking lot at one point or another."
11471,2685207,5,mewa23,21/04/2023,Extraordinary friendly and helpful staff/owners. Facilities are good and clean. Pitches large and flat. Walking distance to the beautiful town of Ronda.
11471,2672754,4,Emerson_Dias,15/04/2023,"Very organized and clean place. A single point that bothered us was the daily rate starts at 12 noon…. We arrived at 21:00 with the idea of visiting Ronda the next day, and we had to leave at 12:00 the next day."
11471,2672118,5,vanhula,15/04/2023,"For the equipment and the location in connection with the price (24 euros - if you pay in cash and at least 2 stays there is a 20% discount on the normal price of 30 euros per night) super great! Always happy, because the lady at the reception couldn't be nicer either :-)"
11471,2670274,5,luisa1902,14/04/2023,"Great campsite, sanitary facilities are clean, restaurant makes delicious dishes. Connection to the city of Ronda on foot in 30 minutes, reception is very friendly"
11471,2648468,4,Faty30,08/04/2023,"Exceptional welcome, very correct space, hot and powerful shower and very clean. I was also able to exchange my books for others that had been left at the reception... great idea."
11471,2636021,4,JusIna,02/04/2023,"Beautiful, well-kept campsite • Operator super friendly • 3 nights including electricity for €72 if you pay in cash • Sanitary mostly clean • Walk to Ronda about 25 minutes possible • Every night, unfortunately, super annoying barking dogs"
11471,2628134,3,jesmart,28/03/2023,very decent campsite. very expensive restaurant and the bread is more 1.50 / person. bad service
11471,2626459,5,HeidiMorgner,27/03/2023,The nicest place we've been to so far. All very clean and good place to visit Ronda. Restaurant a bit expensive but very good food. Very friendly welcome and helpful. We wanted to stay one day and it turned into four.
11471,2619017,5,ManilaTao,21/03/2023,One of the best campgrounds you will find in Spain. We were there with our 11 month old toddler for visiting Ronda (one of the most beautiful villages in Spain) and could not have had a better place. If you go to the city center (bridge and bull arena) I recommend taking the bikes (it’s around 3km). But you could also walk! Restaurant is really good but a bit pricey for Spain. We’ll come again!
11471,2613878,5,Alanister0314,18/03/2023,"We stayed at the campsite rather than motorhome site for the facilities for the children. Two playgrounds, mini golf (not good, though the kids enjoyed it) and table tennis. Wonderful shower facilities, lovely hot shower. Laundry with outdoor hanging space. Lovely owner/manager. Expensive at €36 though."
11471,2609071,4,Snowbird2028,14/03/2023,"Very neat place. Nice reception. Walking distance to Ronda. Of course everything that could be expected with campsites firmly in ""German hands""... Nevertheless, we'd love to come back."
11471,2607976,1,ResiundOli,13/03/2023,"I only give one star because the manager completely overreacted because I took away my right to debit the EC payment in CHF from my account. EC payments always cost money. You really don't have to react like that, especially at the price of €36 per night for two adults and one child."
11471,2600895,4,kaethe2710,06/03/2023,"Cash payment for 2 nights results in 51 euros for 2 people with a camper. 4 stars is appropriate, nice reception, many parking spaces very level despite the hillside location. Sanitary very good. Wifi bad."
11471,2596520,5,Michel1248,02/03/2023,"Super nice staff, even spoke very good German. Awesome campsite with everything in perfect condition. The city of Ronda is within easy walking distance 70s absolutely worth seeing."
11471,2591496,2,xsehen,26/02/2023,Unfortunately no special prices for overwintering.
11471,2588938,5,Franchino,24/02/2023,"As I imagine a campsite should be. Very clean, tidy, well-kept, hot water everywhere and without limitations. A bit long walk to visit Ronda but pleasant. Not cheap, 25 Euros with electricity. If desired, they also have a camper area next door, certainly cheaper but with fewer services."
11471,2580433,5,fluffyppaul,17/02/2023,"Nice accommodations! They also have an area for camper-vans that are just travelling through: 15€ for a night with electricity, water, toilets, shower etc. - also good if you’re looking for an a little bit less crowded area and don’t mind it being a bit more basic / less fancy ;)"
11471,2570518,4,jiri70,06/02/2023,"Quality campsite, everything clean and maintained. Toilets and showers clean hot water. Possibility of washing for €5. There is also a restaurant next to the campsite. There is also a children's playground in the camp. For a three-night stay, the price was €24 per night - motorhome, 2 people, dog, electricity. Payment in cash. Highly recommend for a visit to the city of Ronda."

11471,2561054,4,Rainerlein,26/01/2023,"A high-priced place that you can recommend. Large flat pitches with medium-rise building stock.

11471,2558220,5,larguito_77,22/01/2023,Ideal campsite to rest. Too quiet. It has good services and the treatment of the person in charge of the Camping (Carmen) was spectacular. We will return without a doubt.
11471,2546205,5,mobil58,08/01/2023,Great space for Camper outside of the main campground recommend for a night or two! It’s convenient to walk or bike to Ronda. Two showers and toilets are available. And all including power for 15 Euro! And the staff is super friendly!! We would definitely go back!
11471,2535149,5,campiquipugui,31/12/2022,"Perfect campsite! Super nice staff, we were treated great! We were here this summer and we hope to repeat. It is true that the plots do not have much privacy, but it is ideal for visiting Ronda, taking a good bath with great views. Bread service at the entrance. Clean bathrooms with new facilities. Laundry service. Definitely a 10!"

It also has a motorhome area if you do not want to enter the campsite. Three days on a pitch with electricity, 2 people, €81. You can walk to the town, 500 meters, carefully because the road does not have a shoulder."
11471,2510086,5,RandyAndy68,01/12/2022,"Very neat place. Sanitary facilities very clean. Nice hot showers and hot water to rinse off. Ronda is easy to reach by bike. The place is also well secured, especially now when there is little going on. There is a discount for cash payments."

11471,2495756,1,globetrutter,15/11/2022,"The sanitary facilities are hardly kept clean. Because a sanitary building is closed due to the low season, everyone has to use that one sanitary building. Bad WIFI. You are put on top of each other."

Very suitable to visit Ronda. We were there for 5 days and felt very comfortable. In the end we had to drive because people had rented the bungalows over All Saints' Day, which were too noisy. The place can't do anything about that."

You feel very comfortable on the campsite. There is a point deduction because of the sanitary facilities, which are not cleaned that often and can therefore get quite dirty (hair in the shower, toilet paper often empty)."

At least you can’t burn or freeze yourself, since only the tiniest stream of water comes out hitting maybe only a square centimeter of your skin.

Many free activities for children and adults: swimming pool, playground, giant chess, miniature golf, ping-pong table. It is also very easy to reach the city after 15 minutes of walking.

If you have a van and no need for electricity, ask for a place at the very top of the campsite. The terraces are in grass, the view on Ronda superb and the intimacy better."
11471,479449,2,Toutoune44,08/05/2019,"Quiet and well located, clean sanitary. However desperately lacks greenery and therefore privacy. This poses all the more problem when the regulars are not welcoming .. Very expensive out of season (no pool). 28 € for two van with electricity."

11471,413918,5,papouK,13/12/2018,"We can only confirm the praise of previous users. This campground is renovating motorhome pitches with stabilized, level pitches, and when the hedgerows have grown between the plots, a good privacy will be guaranteed. In the meantime we take full advantage of sanitary refurbished, the emptying area renovated, and all other possibilities mentioned throughout the notices below. As for Carmen's welcome, her courtesy, her smile are worth all the praise. If you come to visit Ronda the romantic, do not hesitate to take a look here: you will not be disappointed."

The receptionist was SO kind and the toilet block brand new & spotless. Laundry is £3.50 to wash and detergent already in the machine. The swimming pool was meant to be closed (2nd October) but because the weather is so nice they opened it up and it’s like being in a 5 star resort. 1 night, 2 adults, electricity, WiFi and a load of washing = €33"

11471,213965,1,Flyky,08/12/2017,"I do not know how it will be in summer but now it is under minimums. It has no restaurant and it is quite gloomy to go to the bathrooms (quite dirty and abandoned) very little light. On the other hand the staff told us that it was not worth going down to Ronda that everything would be closed and there would be no people (on the bridge of the Constitution at 7pm), but we did not pay attention to it. Not very recommendable Best P of the train station"
11471,212915,3,Dametmelo,28/11/2017,"Quiet campsite and nice home. Few people in Nov 2017, location big enough, but not flat. For electricity, many plugs do not work. The toilets are clean."

11471,195720,4,isabelleR,20/09/2017,Clean and nice campsite. A caveat on men's showers where half of the showerheads are out of order. Plan cash to pay (27 € / night for a camper to 2). To visit the center on foot plan 6 km (round trip) attention to the return because it will climb without stopping. We tried the stop that worked.
11471,195267,5,ChaPhi,18/09/2017,"Perfect, after 2 weeks spent in Spain, this is the first campsite where we feel good and where we will stay for several days. In addition, the landscape is beautiful"

11471,188572,3,amizy,01/09/2017,"Welcome in French by Carmen who is also good advice on things to do in Ronda. Attention, the pitches, although espaliers, bend, so it is necessary to bring shims or position well his van. Sanitary decrepit but clean. The campsite restaurant is quality, not extremely typical but the staff is nice. Payment of the campsite in cash only."
11471,186192,4,pticlod,27/08/2017,"Super well maintained campsite. € 27? 1 night? 2person, electricity, very cold welcome. The first who snatches a smile to the receptionist will be entitled to a glass of sangria."
11471,176783,1,SCOF,16/08/2017,"Camping very bad for what it costs. The old toilets and the shabby, old showers and almost no water comes out. At night you have to go with a torch because it is practically dark, almost all streetlights without light. In the pool there is no lifeguard and people are at their ease doing what they want. All this is because the campsite does not have enough staff to cover the needs they have."
11471,173992,5,lapicaudais,13/08/2017,"Good campsite overall, sloping location, holds are not enough to catch up. our site neighbors do not seem to know the settlement and we are undergoing their radio. 2 km to visit Ronda feasible on foot."

11471,134368,2,marinier59,11/05/2017,"A real campsite in an absolute monopoly situation where all services are subject to an additional charge. For example mini golf €2/person/1 hour. I think that at €24.50, 2 people 1 campervan per night access to this activity should be free. I'm not even talking about the swimming pool and the mini baguette for €1.30."

Mini golf €2 1 hour. And to top it all off, it costs €1.30 per baguette to defrost. The owners take advantage of their situation, alone on the site."

11471,33085,2,pheclaf,06/04/2015,"This campsite, the only one close to Ronda (accessible on foot) is very expensive (especially out of season) for a more than average service. The toilets deserve renovation. Additional paid WiFi and cash payment... Sloping pitches require the use of wedges."

In the wooded area below it seems that you can spend the night"

The gray water discharge manhole (sewer) is the same as the WC emptying manhole. The filling tap is also the same as for cleaning potty. In addition, the faucet is push-button and with a diameter greater than 16 mm."
11491,3048995,3,albertobd,31/07/2023,"It is appreciated that they put a free area in an area near the beach. What if he will ask the town hall to indicate where the emptying of black and gray is done since it is done in the same place, raising an iron lid that is no longer the one that appears in the photo. Please mark it with a graffiti on the ground or sign. Very bad access for emptying, many potholes, not as it appears in the photos."

11491,2549517,5,tabascofan,11/01/2023,Free parking space near the beach with free drinking water. There are 5* for that. Other grouches should check their judging behavior or go to a €30 campsite.
11491,2282945,1,jordaco,22/08/2022,Small and very fair area for both Ac and maneuvering. Pressurized water tap impossible to fill. The black ones have to lift a lid in the same place as the gray ones.
11491,2248422,2,pattper,16/08/2022,"Small places, parking at the edge of the beach is better. You have to lift a metal plate on the drain area, before settling down and opening the valves. the toilet also empties under the plate."

11491,1879074,1,dianayjose,09/05/2022,What a mess. It has emptied grays and indicates a painting that you also emptied black there. The minimum water pipe. And as there is some other car you can not even maneuver.
11491,1804017,1,Katelllfr,02/04/2022,impossible to fill the water it is a fountain without a thread we filled with a jerry can at the fountain on the beach

The problem is noise at night. Dogs bark until the next day. The black and gray water empties in the same place which makes the spot not very clean, and to fill the water you need a big enough thief adapter, because the tap has no screw thread"
11491,1655120,4,Mamiedares,21/10/2021,The place is superb except in rainy weather when you can stay in the mud. Dogs barked most of the night. Pity…. Magnificent beach.

The squares are short, long cars or vans are out on the road, be careful if it rains it will be difficult to get out through the mud. We had a great night, a quiet area with the beach next to it, the baker passes by and the beach at low tide fills with shellfish."

11491,1386287,4,KaKaWet,31/07/2021,"Perfect area to be quiet. It is true that the access and the tap could be improved, but otherwise it is very good."

11491,1345917,4,albertobd,21/07/2021,"It is appreciated that you give us these free areas and if you can improve access and potholes, we would appreciate it to the Boiro town hall."
11491,1281476,2,pacasu,27/06/2021,"It is appreciated that more and more areas are being made and the municipalities are betting on this type of tourism, but this area could make it a little more comfortable when maneuvering, when emptying sewage and putting some containers"
11491,1252533,2,Ketchp,13/06/2021,"Very small space, makes larger vans manuver tricky, water with no easy way to refill, and only possible to discharge gray waters. no WC empty space available"
11491,1249123,1,w-haeberle.de,11/06/2021,One star is still too many. The tap does not have a proper connection. Refueling with fresh water is a disaster. Disposing of black water is not possible.
11491,1192457,4,AdriDana,11/05/2021,"Small area, for AC not very big, we went with a 6m camper and well. It can be loaded clean and emptied black and gray. The black ones are lifting the grid of the gray ones, it is indicated with a painting that puts WC. To load clean the fountain is to press and it fits quite well to the hose adapter, it is not threaded. We had a very quiet night, perfect with dogs."
11491,1155118,3,josema57,21/03/2021,"Small place for 5 motorhomes, near the beach, quiet place to spend the night with free filling and emptying services, there is no chemical toilet to empty water"
11491,1089063,3,Manu88,11/10/2020,"It is good that it is free, it has water loading and discharge, that is, the tap does not have a thread for the hose and is fñde push button. This super abandoned, you can't see the sign with the brush and the muddy road. and in my case the ac (7'20m) does not fit in the square. To fix it, it was worth it, but just by clearing and putting on a normal tap it improved 100%. The quiet area and a few meters from the beach."
11491,1087278,1,blaiseetvero,09/10/2020,"How to say? No more, it will be complicated: difficult access, impossible to turn around and with the mud that reigns it is even better to avoid trying to ""park"" in one of the four spaces available unless you want to stay there. They are anyway too short for CCs. On the services side: you can drain gray water, black water through a trap on the ground and to fill the available push button (the same for rinsing cassettes) Suffice to say that this area is only intended to be able to prohibit camping car parking at the beach 20 meters below! Thanks to the municipality. Too bad the region is magical."
11491,1027556,4,cuelebre,05/09/2020,"Very grateful area for the site where it is. the better they put it on us, the more ""prim"" we become. The gray water sump, if the grate is raised, serves to discharge the black water. In fact, it is signposted like this on both sides."
11491,994755,1,scamagaz7,23/08/2020,The tap has no thread. we had to do a trick with a lighter to widen the hose. you cannot empty the pot and the firm is neglected. so we emptied gray water that urged us but we will not take it into account for other occasions
11491,963266,3,tani.tania,14/08/2020,"Space with little space and quite neglected, but the place where it is is worth it. Neighbors warned us that if you park outside the area they will fine you, even in the pine forest."
11491,946117,3,Pablo_TSI,10/08/2020,"We spent the night in the AC area, we arrived at 11pm and there were 3 free places. In the area, outside the area you cannot park; legal or not, there are no signs for motorhomes. Note: in the area there is no sewage discharge area and the clean water tap does not have a thread."
11491,908613,4,VANKSITA,29/07/2020,"The place is great, the pine forest and the beach are great but the area can be greatly improved: little space and water tap without thread and push button. I have preferred not to empty sewage as there is no specific place for it."
11491,905176,5,Griselda76,27/07/2020,"The service area fulfills its function, the best thing is that it is at the entrance of a pine forest where you can spend the night. Slope but with shade between the trees. A very busy beach with a picnic area. Noisy day but very quiet at night."
11491,904858,4,MarisayFran,27/07/2020,"There are only 4 places, a pity. Following the same road you reach the beach, cheap bar / restaurant and very good homemade food. In the pine forest in theory you can not stay overnight ... but we are about 25 AC and GV ... and no problem today."
11491,904683,5,Metalpez,27/07/2020,"Perfect for children, the beach is quiet and not covered."
11491,898007,2,Octane,25/07/2020,"Only 4 seats, use it to empty gray. I am afraid that the 4 places were occupied by ACs that had been there for a long time."
11491,888935,1,AlessiaHakunaMatata,22/07/2020,Bad x all the ACs that stay too many days! There are few places and we would have to share them. and you won't stay there for months! The cop does not allow parking on the beachfront.
11491,873327,2,PabloyBorja,16/07/2020,"Very regular services. Push button tap. Poor hitch, without threads. Black water in the same place as gray ..."

11491,626088,2,Dioptrico,14/08/2019,"I divide the comment into 2. The filling and emptying area has to improve a lot, the large motorhomes have a difficult time and the tap of the push-button without thread. Now, the beach area (where there are no prohibition signs and there were more cars) a joy, wonderful landscape."
11491,571924,4,sebpot,23/07/2019,The service area is convenient for emptying after a stay along a beach. Only the water filling requires an adapter and is activated by a push button. Thank you to the town hall for the installation.
11491,552200,3,Maryvilla,13/07/2019,We have spent a night there and it is a nice place.

11491,433755,3,jannilou,26/02/2019,Nice quiet place to spend the night. You have to maneuver a little to park flat. The emptying and filling services are about 200 meters on the left before arriving at the beach.

11491,365509,3,AnaOrtega,05/09/2018,"We have spent the night, nice and quiet place in front of the beach, large playground for children, green area. As people say, watch out for pivots. Very narrow sites. Municipal area. The town has nothing but there is a lot of vineyard in the pedestrian part. Nice walk around the beach for people and bicycles."
11491,319490,4,joshi_es,07/08/2018,"Excellent place, shaded and right on the beach. It is full August, and during the week we are only 4 motorhomes."
11491,292409,2,Marquesmm,18/07/2018,"The area seems abandoned or non-operational as there is no motorhome signal, pets are not allowed on the beach, chiringuito area with scent of darros, pine forest with picnic areas, narrow access road. We were going to spend the night and we left."
11491,245540,3,scotspike,03/05/2018,"Dog is still here, still barks but intermittently, not all night.  Very quiet spot otherwise.  Services 100 metres back along the track in.  We didn’t notice it on the way in.  Nice view."
11491,242837,3,Goun25,29/04/2018,Correct place but not very quiet because cars pass and turn even at night.

11491,153952,4,victormartin,18/07/2017,Good area with emptying and filling services. Quiet and the beach next door.
11491,144449,3,migxerry,20/06/2017,It has filling and emptying service about a hundred meters before reaching the beach on the left in an unmarked access but you will see streetlights next to the street.
11491,104491,4,tata13,11/09/2016,"I was in 2015. I liked the place, quiet, with picnic area at the foot of the river. The night views are priceless, simply amazing."

11507,3278788,2,Sanler,09/09/2023,"Good location, near the center, it's a shame that there were motorhomes occupying two seats and passenger cars."
11507,3253418,3,GomezLisardo,03/09/2023,"Good parking, spacious and in a good area, with respect to services, gray and black discharge and clean water recharge, but a single point for everything."
11507,3251781,5,Pknando,03/09/2023,Very good area!! Despite it being Saturday it is quite quiet. The squares are very large and have services. Great initiative that I hope many town councils follow.
11507,3247401,4,MarkAm,01/09/2023,We have stopped to rest and visit Ponferrada all the services except electricity. Walking to the center 5 to 10 minutes
11507,3232395,5,MarcoPVaz,29/08/2023,"Good place to spend the night with free services. the problem is the unloading grille, which is poorly placed in place, we have no way of positioning the vehicle to unload it without being on the asphalt. It is our obligation to clean the floor after flushing and try to send it to the grate."

11507,3194030,5,ACGoNi,21/08/2023,"Very well located area to visit the town. It is advisable to eat at the Mencía restaurant just 450m from the area, with a menu of the day for only €11 that includes 4 dishes, drink, dessert and coffee, impressive. Simple food but a lot of it, the spectacular jerky. very quiet night. It has no shadow."
11507,3184469,4,manuraidgr,20/08/2023,Parking for AC quite large. Very close to the historic center. The downside is the download area. Black a chest that is not marked behind the tap. And the gray ones without a slope on the ground that causes the water to go to the sides

11507,2519519,4,josemaitxo,11/12/2022,"The parking lot is perfect, very close to the center, very bad for us, who park 2 meters between the wohnmobil as if we had a truck, then we complain about the demos."
11507,2518225,4,pepedetui,10/12/2022,"Well located service area, wide squares. They should signpost and improve/expand the emptying place."
11507,2516002,3,RamonBonet,08/12/2022,"The area is good and close to the center, ideal for visiting Ponferrada, but for €5 you have another one very close with all the services and you don't have to put up with the uncivic people who park in the evacuation zone, also having many free spaces."
11507,2494199,4,VanlifeCat,13/11/2022,"Centrally located parking space next to the pilgrim hostel, which filled up well in the evening. We had a nice view of the vineyards and the plots are a good size. It was also quiet at night. The supply and disposal is rather poor, as there is only one tap that is used for flushing the cassette toilets, so there is no option for us to fill up the water."
11507,2480625,5,J.Sor,03/11/2022,"expanded, central and quiet, highly recommended."

My suggestion is to park leaving a little space just for you without looking at the lines, since the marked plots are very wide and you take away space for more ac..."
11507,2435222,5,Juhy,10/10/2022,Perfect night. Good for the city. Recommendable visit to the castle area. Services good.
11507,2412268,4,Lamark,29/09/2022,"AC area very quiet and very close to the city center. The plots are very spacious so it fills up quickly, we arrived on a Saturday at 8:00 p.m. and there was no room, although we still parked at the end of the parking lot without any problem."

11507,2362984,3,beloncete,11/09/2022,"The car park is 6 minutes from the castle and the spaces are...huge (they were for buses and trucks). But the loading and unloading services are third world: a mini-grill right next to the ""hole"" to flush toilets, with the same tap to wash potty or load water. Fatal. There is no shade. It won't be that hard to do something more decent. Ponferrada deserves it."
11507,2349193,4,patoune65,07/09/2022,very large space beautiful view water free emptying quiet night day ok Small but very pretty historic center On Wednesdays the entrances to the castle museum etc Free just a small improvement for the emptying and adding a tap for the WC but thank you to the municipality for welcoming us
11507,2347420,4,maulan64,07/09/2022,Well located a few minutes from the city center. Pitches are wide and deep. The ground is tarred. It seems there are a few resident motorhomes squatting a few spots. I take away a star for the single tap that is used for clean water and rinsing.
11507,2342556,4,nuaywill,05/09/2022,"The location to empty gray water could be improved. The area is large and the seats are huge, (I think they were bus seats before) when it was full they also put them in the middle. Very close to the town hall square. We went to shower at the shell gas station area, showers €3 a shower and super large. We took one for the 4 of us and they gave us towels and soap. 5' taking a walk."
11507,2339618,5,jorferpele,04/09/2022,"Area very close to the center and wide although you may arrive and it is full. Even so, it must be said that they park cars so you may have to sleep in the parking lot outside but hey, the one outside is very big too."
11507,2319902,5,RamFerTo,30/08/2022,"Perfect parking to visit my beloved Ponferrada. Asphalted, with a slight slope, and with all the services available (the location of the sewer to empty the gray water could be greatly improved). A 5-minute walk from La Encina and 10 from the town hall. Recommendation; Don't arrive too late because, even though there is room for 30-35 vehicles, it fills up and you have to sleep in the parking lot in front."
11507,2318137,5,nomadazaca,29/08/2022,"A good area to visit the city of Ponferrada, well located and very spacious. The emptying of gray water could be improved but I still give it a 5."

11507,2263508,4,marcangouleme,18/08/2022,"Nice area 10 minutes walk from the historic center. Very wide pitches, perhaps too wide because we could accommodate at least 1/3 more CC. Free services as almost always in Spain, except electricity."

Thank you Ponferrada."

11507,2205883,2,elhinchon,09/08/2022,"the area is fine, asphalt, level, with unloading, and close to the historic center. there were other caravans and campers. what we didn't like is that some cars have come in until 1 am, they turn around and leave... I don't understand why... it's people who aren't staying... in addition to this, some young people also walk by there... the police have also passed by, which leaves a bit of peace."
11507,2179042,4,marisolss,05/08/2022,"Very large area and with all services. Right next to the historic center. You only have to pay attention when emptying gray water, since the space is very tight and you have to aim very well at the drain. The black water cover is behind the faucet and there is only that faucet. Many thanks to the City Council for the facilities."

Very well located, 5 minutes from the center, there are several streets with many bars, where there is a lot of atmosphere. We visited the Clock Tower, the Castle of Los Templarios and the Basilica of the Virgen de La Encina."

11507,1832117,4,Mijina,17/04/2022,"Great area and very well located to get to know the city. Very spacious and with another very large parking lot next door. Super quiet and not a single noise. It's level. Perhaps it would need another water intake and emptying, queues can form. The emptying of black water is a bit inconvenient, otherwise great. Thank you!!"
11507,1822935,1,firecampervan,15/04/2022,"It will be Easter, crowded parking. Drunks at 3am screaming and urinating between cars. For those of us who go as a family it is not the best place. I repeat, it will be the dates. a pity I doubt we will return"
11507,1815104,5,Mescal,11/04/2022,"We parked to spend the day in Ponfe. The location couldn't be better, with plenty of spaces for both AC and vans. Having a hostel next door I don't think there will be a problem to sleep peacefully."

11507,1791983,5,JMPapou,22/03/2022,Nice parking area 2 steps from the historic center. Close to Las Medulas for visiting this village and hiking in the canyon of the old Roman gold mines. This site is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
11507,1788285,4,rad53,19/03/2022,"Open car park directly at the pilgrim hostel. Easily accessible nice environment good view of the mountains. About 500 m away is the restaurant eureKA. With good reviews; in the other direction 500 m large Shell gas station. Also with a mobile home parking space, only electricity and water are subject to a charge of five euros for 24 hours. Castello and Basilica can be reached on foot in max. 15 minutes."
11507,1781281,3,lasarastark,12/03/2022,"Pros: Wide, fairly level, and close to downtown. Quiet night despite it. Cons: As the service area is a bit deficient (only one water tap), they could invest a little in renovating the terminal and the drains. Surrounded by vacant lots where people usually walk loose dogs, if you have dogs like me and you are responsible for them, you may have some inconvenience."
11507,1770675,3,Caleyeros,02/03/2022,"Very large parking and close to the center. It has no electricity and only has one faucet, so cleaning the potty and filling the water don't mix too well. The faucet is no longer pulsation. Otherwise quiet for the night."
11507,1766933,4,Natas,26/02/2022,"Very spacious parking lot, close to the center and the castle. Emptying and refilling goes well, no problems with it. Slept great, little noise, even on the weekend! The castle is a must by the way :)"
11507,1761591,4,Asgarius,20/02/2022,Large area very close to the Castle and the center. I don't give it 5 stars because the emptying area is quite poor. I encourage the City Council of Ponferrada to improve this area to have a 5-star Area.
11507,1728220,4,kiwionavan,06/01/2022,Quiet night. Totally flat parking with very large spaces. One step from the center. The only downside to not having the 5 stars is the single tap to clean the toilet and fill with water. We just emptied gray and black. We do not fill if there are no 2 different taps
11507,1718764,5,lafita,29/12/2021,"It has been a Ponferrada discovery, we have loved it. The area is very good, very quiet, we have only been one night. The train passes by but at night, no. There is a fountain to provide water."
11507,1709140,3,LCIRPM,12/12/2021,"Good for parking near the old town, but it cannot be said that there are services. Black water can be emptied, but gray water cannot be emptied adequately or water can be refilled properly."
11507,1703651,4,Viajerohappy,05/12/2021,"Flat parking near the historic center. Perfect to spend the night if you are going en route or to visit Ponferrada. The subject of services is something else, a real mess. Only one tap for clean water and poti. We obviously haven't used them. So difficult and expensive will it be to put 2 well differentiated taps with thread ???"
11507,1696630,4,Joytour,23/11/2021,"We stayed here for 2 nights. For a trip to Las Medulas and to visit Ponferrada by day and by night. Surprisingly, we experienced very quiet nights for a starting place and slept well. The place is level and, in our opinion, safe. Shopping and dining is possible in the vicinity. We didn't fill up fresh water because others emptied their toilets."
11507,1687819,3,HelleSkovmose,13/11/2021,A parking lot with a view.  The only water is for rinse the wc.

11507,1669475,4,margaya,30/10/2021,"In my previous comment I said that if it had a better light point, I wanted to specify that I was referring to a streetlight because the place is very dark."
11507,1664403,3,viajandogeral,27/10/2021,"Traveling general been here. 2 silent nights, beautiful city not far away, pleasant walk. lacked water for toilet and drinking water but even so, it is worth the visit."
11507,1664396,4,margaya,27/10/2021,"Very good place, although if there was a better point of light. They also reproach some users for dumping the solids into the gray water grates and then not even rinsing the area. Nor are the papers thrown away."
11507,1661737,3,rvanvugt,25/10/2021,"Spacious parking area ideal for a weekend to visit Ponferrada. Becomes full in the weekend, but as there is enough space, it did not bother me to park close tot eachother. Shower/toilet for a voluntary donation at the pilgrims- pension. Dump of grey and blackwater available, I did not check freshwater. Little noise around, but with earplugs perfect sleep. Flat and fully tarmacked."
11507,1657406,4,FelipeSotillos,22/10/2021,"We spent two nights, one in the area set up for motorhomes and the other in the pilgrim's car park, they are together, but being close to the street the cars are heard more. As for the water and drainage services, do not need them. Everything was correct and the location is very good to visit the old town and the castle."
11507,1657032,1,astroluzz,22/10/2021,"It is nothing more than an asphalt esplanade with a water tap that has NO water. Very deficit for a town that should at least give water. If you are going to park, there is plenty of space, free."
11507,1646550,4,kingokiara,16/10/2021,"The first place where we premiere sleeping in a van. We recommend it for its magnificent location and its service station, the pilgrim .... Large clean bathroom for 3 euros, they provided towels, hair dryer and toiletries. a hit for nomads. Maybe at night a car with music will arrive, but we were able to sleep without problems. recommended 100x100."

11507,1629975,5,calle5621,06/10/2021,"Great parking space, enough space although the vehicles are close by. The disposal point is also perfectly adequate, the pilgrims' hostel is right next door. We asked if we could take a shower there. No problem with the hint to give some money (voluntarily). I think that's fine! It should be made even more attractive in the future. Great use of the hostel!"
11507,1620757,4,JulioMM,01/10/2021,"Excellent place, wide, asphalted and level. The gray drain is a bit sloppy, it is poorly leveled and the motorhome must be positioned carefully to avoid spilling the liquid. The cassette is emptied in a small box behind the water inlet, and it does not have a thread. With these caveats, it is perfect for visiting the Templar castle and the city."
11507,1617727,4,NachVanLife,30/09/2021,Very spacious and fairly level squares. Perfect situation to visit the city. The loading / unloading area quite simple. Silence at night. 3/4 blocks from a laundry room with wifi and power outlets. Good for Ponferrada

The only downside is the gray drainpipe is too far back near the tap, and if there are Motorhomes on the sides you can't maneuver. but it does its job perfectly. Many thanks to Ponferrada, it is also a city worth visiting."

11507,1469714,3,madtrix,17/08/2021,"Great esplanade very close to the old part of the city. I put 3 stars because the water area is inappropriate, gray and black waters in the same place that you cannot reach due to its proximity to the tap. There is only one to clean potis and fill all very unsanitary waters !! But quiet to sleep. We do not use the services ... we will try in Astorga."
11507,1468598,3,LaLuisa2020,16/08/2021,"Area very close to the center of the city and quite quiet to sleep, a bit uneven and the tap is a pain in the neck, it would be wonderful to change it for a threaded one."
11507,1464390,4,pepetrueno,16/08/2021,"Perfect for visiting Ponferrada, 10 minutes or less from the historic center. We sleep very well and calmly. Plenty of room but beware in mid-August as it fills up. I do not give it all the stars since we do not use services, only sleep, and I cannot rate it."
11507,1452169,2,averroes,13/08/2021,"Quiet to sleep and plenty of parking space but that cannot be called an area. A non-threaded push-button tap and a grille on the floor for grays and blacks 25 cm from the tap as it seems to me little less than impossible to approach there to drain, especially when you have to enter from the front; I do not know for what so much ""technical"" in the city hall. A SIMPLE esplanade with a fountain."
11507,1447795,4,RuiTrincaoDuarte,12/08/2021,Its nice. Very space place. Quiet.
11507,1444843,4,coccorsi,12/08/2021,"With our caravan we could not discharge black and gray water, access was not possible. Otherwise very quiet to sleep"
11507,1441995,3,Duque73,11/08/2021,"Good place to spend the night very close to the center, the tap is not rough and the water comes out with a lot of pressure"
11507,1415023,4,blor,06/08/2021,"Very good AC Area, but if there were the possibility of changing the tap for drinking water with a threaded one, it would save water and it would be more comfortable for the user."
11507,1411002,5,DaniSam74,06/08/2021,"We only stop to empty and fill. It is very well located, very spacious and spacious, as well as quiet. Highly recommended. Thanks to the Ponferrada City Council."
11507,1409963,3,romeo1967,05/08/2021,Free area with loading and unloading. It fills up in the evening. Ponferrada absolutely to visit
11507,1407827,3,roadtrip69,05/08/2021,"Lots of c / c but fortunately because the water tap is not suitable, so a nice man helped us out with a ""flex greenhouse"". we only went through it, but the water and the drainage had the merit of being there for free."
11507,1406699,4,LPK,05/08/2021,"Parking with very large squares, we spent the night very quiet. Free filling and emptying"
11507,1401324,5,JuanPedroMunozAntolinos,03/08/2021,"Perfect location, free emptying and water service. about 50 expandable spaces if the adjoining car park is occupied."
11507,1398560,4,valsi,03/08/2021,Large square and large stalls. free water and drainage. near the city center where you can visit the Templar castle. ok q
11507,1397058,4,Anloro,03/08/2021,"It fills up easily, but it has a parking lot next to it where we can stay without a problem. Some noise from cars as people gather from bars. It's near the castle."
11507,1391775,4,EldaDC,01/08/2021,"A short walk from the center. Squares perhaps too large to not be able to take anything outside, tonight, for example, there were at least 7/8 ac parked in line in the center, out of so many that we were parked! if the lines were repainted, space would be used. Thanks to the City Council for thinking of us. The 10 tourist office too."
11507,1391646,4,MiguelMY,01/08/2021,"We have slept 2 nights, the 1st in the parking lot next door, very quiet. A large and central area. The squares are very large, if they were repainted and made a little smaller there would be more places, as well as creating a new row to park in the center. The tap is push-button without thread. Thanks to the City Council for this area and to the Tourist Office for the indications given."
11507,1391039,4,Nela1962,01/08/2021,Large area near the city center and the Templar castle worth visiting
11507,1390334,4,NomadasCharlatanes,01/08/2021,"Very good area, well located to visit the old town and with many spaces. Outside the area there is also a parking lot in case it is full. The only fault is the loading and unloading area, which is a bit complicated to unload and when filling the tap, it does not have a thread and you have to adapt a pressure nozzle. Still recommended 100%"
11507,1385156,1,anuskilla,31/07/2021,"Miracle bikes were not stolen from us. With pliers they managed to cut the padlocks and due to the noise we woke up and got out of the van. It was 7 in the morning. On the other hand, there is a flat area and another on a slope. We have slept well until the incident. There are bars opposite. Near the Templar castle."
11507,1382863,4,anfravi,30/07/2021,"Ample parking, tap for drinking water without thread, otherwise perfect"
11507,1378590,3,Navajas,29/07/2021,"Large, very flat esplanade and close to the center. It has no shadow and lacks lighting. Very complicated filling tap, it does not have a thread, it is pressure and does not use standardized measures. Thanks City Hall."
11507,1355363,3,obesix8,23/07/2021,Ample parking and very close to the center. It has no shadows.
11507,1354844,3,Kuffner,23/07/2021,All right. Spacious places. Pressure tap without thread so the universal adapter is necessary. Very central to visit Ponferrada.
11507,1353719,3,nomad2000,23/07/2021,"Good place to load and unload water, visit Ponferrada and little else, on hot days it is a site without shade where it is unbearable to be."
11507,1350618,4,robertoro,22/07/2021,"GOOD: central, clean, flat, large and quiet BAD: no shadows, water area to improve, only one tap for everything and no thread"

11507,1327908,3,baro60,15/07/2021,"Unshaded area but very close to the historic center, especially the Templar castle. Camperservice is a bit on the edge of age but still working. Ideal for sightseeing and for unloading / loading. For the night I think it is a bit noisy because of the road nearby."
11507,1323452,3,Ernes98,14/07/2021,"The place is very central and quiet, huge squares perhaps too much if the idea is not to camp. To vary gray ... it is impossible, the sewer is half a meter from the water intake, and there is hardly any unevenness, if you open, you spread all the dirty water over several places, and the filling ... the tap is half broken, side and push button. However, thanks to the City Council of Ponferrada for hosting us."
11507,1312204,4,Remolin,10/07/2021,"Good area attached to the pilgrim hostel, ideal for visiting the capital of Bierzo. We have not spent the night, but the place is very quiet and without loud noises"

11507,1253432,4,Matias71,13/06/2021,"It is very well located, flat, near the castle and the square. Do not stay on Saturday because they make a bottle in the parking lot next door."

11507,1237641,3,RamonKTF,05/06/2021,Two very quiet nights. Near the center. The water service point deserves a redesign and renovation.
11507,1229301,4,mafo111,31/05/2021,Good area to visit the city of Ponferrada.... quiet.

11507,1169827,1,cesarmovil,07/04/2021,"Pros: large flat and good location Cons: there are no services or they are so bad that it is as if there were none. There's no water. The area where you empty the fatal gray ones since you empty and the water instead of going to the sewer goes to the gutter ???? Who understands that. We need very, very little motorhomes and they don't even want to offer us so that we can tour their city. Ponferrada seriously that you can't afford two water taps ??????"
11507,1169743,4,Festin,07/04/2021,"Very close to the center and services, very spacious, but just about water issues, refills, emptying. A little dirty all (guilty?). The tap did not work because they had hit it with a vehicle and had to tinker ..."

11507,1164663,2,josebusangel,03/04/2021,"The filling and emptying services can be greatly improved, but a lot. For this reason alone we went to the payment. The squares quite level and the area well located."
11507,1159678,1,CarolfordTransit,28/03/2021,There are no services (water cut off) but right next to one if paying ...... What a coincidence .....
11507,1157950,4,MicSimo,26/03/2021,"Large quiet car park, services seemed to be working but we didn't need them. The only thing is that far from the historic city center. However, we used it as an excellent base for trekking in Las Medulas, highly recommended."
11507,1153342,4,Antaress,18/03/2021,"Good entrance and location. Very flat and spacious land, next to the Pilgrims' Hostel (now closed) Barrio Viejo very close. Advisable for visiting the city."

For these last 2 reasons I give it 3/5."

11507,1062550,4,AntiaBorEros,21/09/2020,Very good option to spend the night. 5 minutes walk from the historic center of Ponferrada. A hose is required for filling with water. There is a grid for draining gray water.
11507,1052176,3,NOC,16/09/2020,Wide and close to the center but not a single shadow and the tap one for grays and blacks cannot be rubberized
11507,1049184,3,Nutopica,14/09/2020,I was in the middle of August. It is practical and close to the center. Urban and without shade. Same tap to fill water and rinse potti ... Pilgrim's hostel next door where you can take a shower (voluntary donation)
11507,1047233,4,Furgo_time,14/09/2020,"We have gone through there again, we think the same! A good area with incredible views and a lot less crowded than last time."
11507,1032257,1,KUN71,07/09/2020,"Huge area shared with trucks. There is usually plenty of room. The water tap is nonsense. It is one of the pushbutton copper types that go very hard and the long, narrow spout and funnel-shaped spout prevents even the universal adapter from holding well. For this reason and for the bad faith incompetence that I see when putting this tap is why I give it the lowest score."
11507,1030117,3,xamascos,06/09/2020,"With basic services, large parking and close to the old town. It has no shade at all and you can hear a lot of traffic from the nearby streets."

At night there should have been a ""night rally"" because a car ""at full throttle"" kept passing by. Otherwise very quiet to spend the night. The water intake service with a ""non-universal"" intake that makes it difficult; the draining of gray does not have a good fall and part of the water goes to the adjoining AC square."
11507,1018520,4,Minathedog,01/09/2020,Five minutes from the tourist center. Some tables would be good since we are so many users. We slept great
11507,1016204,4,Verdicio,31/08/2020,The best place to get to know Ponferrada ... worth a visit (old town and the castle). Justita gray discharge area and the tap for the water very rare and without thread hence the 4 stars otherwise cool.

A 10 for Ponferrada, which is super nice to visit, the people are very friendly and the restaurants, bakeries, and cafes are very good. The only drawback for us was that we did not have the adapter for the water tap, which is very special."

11507,972438,5,Furgo_time,17/08/2020,"Amazing views, but it was full at 7pm, we parked in front. In our opinion, emptying the gray is a bit complex, since the grid is at the edge of the area and you have to maneuver. By. The rest is perfect."
11507,969310,5,LaPitufina,16/08/2020,"The area is very large, squares so large that they are disproportionate. It was full and we were right out front in a paved parking lot. Perfect also to spend the night. In the morning we use the toilets, the tap is a kind of tube without a thread where we could load thanks to a colleague who lent us a perfect home accessory for these situations."
11507,969257,4,Catalina19,16/08/2020,"Free. large plots. paved leveled. 5 minutes walk from the center. filling and emptying service. To give it some drawback, it only has one water outlet, which means that to wash the poty and fill clean water you have to do it from the same place."
11507,968456,5,Aventuramenuda,16/08/2020,"A perfect area to get to know this beautiful city. Level, water intake, gray and black drains, large squares, very quiet and quiet at night and five minutes walk from the historic center."

For access, a good 2 wheel drive can be enough to go even to the bottom, but be careful, maneuvers in the sand are difficult."
11647,3045117,5,makepause,30/07/2023,A beautiful Spot. We spent the night and the morning close to the beach.
11647,3019390,5,LaxeLL17,25/07/2023,"Quiet night with the sound of the waves, great spot! We did not try the 4x4 experience, because the sea is already very close on the other places. We were only 3 vehicles, clean place (contrary to previous opinions), sleep in guaranteed after a drink at the restaurant/bar just opposite! We recommend 100%!"

11647,2858501,5,6869louis,15/06/2023,The best spot in the area (but 4X4 spot) Parking at Lidl or Continent to visit Nazaré then coming here to swim (with waves) then to sleep is the best compromise we have found. a big thank you for this superb spot.
11647,2838545,5,ChristinMe,10/06/2023,Great spot. Don’t drive into the sand if you don’t have a 4x4. There is enough space to park if you know how to drive. And if you get stuck and use mats to get out take them with you after and don’t let your trash behind please!
11647,2816868,1,jibbeontour,03/06/2023,We went all the way to the back and got stuck unfortunately… If you don’t go that far it is a really nice place. Or you need a 4x4. Luckily there were very nice people who helped us!! And took our van out of it with a 4x4

11647,2807771,5,Robert276,01/06/2023,"Top spot! Spent a quiet night and confessed nicely. Unfortunately, not everyone has understood that you don't leave your rubbish (and this includes the legacies of the body and the associated cleaning cloths) in the landscape. After we collected a little around us, it was probably the best place in recent times!"
11647,2782350,5,KaKeMi,24/05/2023,Awesome ! Spots as we like them! a night completely alone with a fantastic sunset. Sleep with the sound of the waves on top. We went all the way with our L2H2 van. It goes by being careful where you put the wheels because a lot of sand but it's worth it because you have a view of the ocean and not the dunes. We love

11647,2459260,5,Rasselbande4x4,23/10/2022,"You first have to drive to the official beach car park and from there follow a sandy path for about 300 meters to the end, otherwise the GPS will lead you to a dead end. Due to the sand only 4x4! Beach parking but also great! Parking space on the beach is fantastically beautiful, very clean with us and right on the beautiful beach. Definitely worth it! Stayed 2 nights with no problems."

We have put ourselves right at the edge of the beach, therefore half a 4x4 with reduced attached due to the sand. If you don't have these precautions, stay at the beginning of the road!"
11647,2258760,2,M.BoXeR,18/08/2022,"It seems a good place, better to go late when the bathers leave. Today Wednesday at noon there was no free space, even cars standing in line to park. It has been impossible to stay."

You should be self-sufficient with electricity and water! The access road is very steep, but at least not a dirt road! The beach, on the other hand, is super nice and also accessible with a dog if you look for a spot away from the visitors!"

11647,2105623,4,matthieuablin,22/07/2022,Excellent place to spend the night and a day almost alone in the world. Beach as far as the eye can see on which it is possible to walk but not to swim (very rough). Little rant: PLEASE LEAVE THE PLACE CLEAN. We are surprised after that no more spot is accessible to us but there are many handkerchiefs on the ground! It's not complicated to keep your paper and throw it in the trash after doing your business!

11647,240552,5,djambo,24/04/2018,Super spot. Quiet. Dinner and sunset on the beach. Ideal!
11647,163172,4,Ernes,01/08/2017,"Right next to the beach. Very nice beach, but something difficult for the bath by the waves. To sleep and spend a day is perfect."
11647,52520,5,tomrider,27/08/2015,"Quiet place to spend the night, close to Nazaré and much less crowded. The dunes allow to be sheltered from the wind, actually do not go too far under pain of getting soggy. Supervised beach, swimming prohibited because too much wave during our visit on 24/7/15"
11647,42552,5,crtss,18/07/2015,"Great area to sleep, quiet with the sound of the waves and the beach right next door."

11650,3099409,5,sueandray,08/08/2023,"Superb facility with free working services (no electric). Plenty of spaces (only 2 or 3 vans there )and we were able to get under the trees for shade. Next to an auditorium where we went to a free concert; swam in the excellent outdoor pools nearby; and biked on the Via Vente which is literally next to the exit. Some noise on Sunday night as locals gather at site picnic tables, but no issues."
11650,3053480,5,SandraGOUVEIA,31/07/2023,"area at the top, free emptying and filling of water. plenty of room, we were only 3 in the parking lot. there is not much shade."
11650,3029895,5,Amilcaras,27/07/2023,"Quite comfortable and clean area, there are more than 20 places and a water emptying and filling service. The only thing missing is for the trees to grow to enjoy shade. The location on the map is wrong, the parking lot is just above, where it says ""parking ac auditorium"" so it is possible not to see it as it happened to me. Thanks to those responsible for promoting places like this."
11650,2960821,4,josecarlos1,14/07/2023,"The exite area has about 17 parking spaces and with all services, well paved, quiet with the municipal swimming pools 2 minutes away. In general, many thanks to the Cabra town hall."

11650,2676658,4,micheL22M03,17/04/2023,"Very nice area. Near the cycle path via verde. Only one downside, we were approached by a local who was begging € 5.00 to eat. In the afternoon he knocked on the door of the cc and in the evening he approached us again in the parking lot."
11650,2661517,4,grberm,11/04/2023,Good area in a very quiet area. It has two rows of parking where one is fairly level and the other is not. It has two areas to empty gray water. The entrance is wide but has a lot of slope and unevenness

11650,2640266,4,xavieronava,04/04/2023,It is in the place known as the source of the river. It is very good because it is quiet and because of the minimum services that are needed. I don't give it a 5 because you have to walk 25' to the historic center.
11650,2632193,5,Yeye_trail,31/03/2023,"Many thanks to the City Council of this beautiful city, for these clean, well-kept facilities and with all the requirements of a rest area for motorhomes."

11650,2593735,4,navenodriza,28/02/2023,The area is quite flat. It is very illuminated. The doors always open. It has a small stone park with wooden benches. Lots of motorhomes. Around 9:00 p.m. they knocked on the door of the motorhome to ask us for money. You sleep peacefully at night and the surroundings are very beautiful for walking and hiking (it is full of hairy caterpillars)
11650,2593112,5,JoseSoto,27/02/2023,"Very good area! Flat, with services! It was full the first afternoon we arrived. A little removed from the center of Cabra, 2km away. Next to the greenway to visit by bike."

11650,2568665,4,tabascofan,04/02/2023,"What is striking here is the intrusive presence of a guy who comes into the parking lot whenever a new camper arrives, quite aggressively selling his oranges. I introduced him to my protection dog, after that he was gone."
11650,2544333,5,ivandracodam,06/01/2023,We spent two nights. A very nice place with the source of the river and a greenway that passes next to it. All the services. If it is true that at night a boy touched us to ask for money.
11650,2543037,3,traveljc,05/01/2023,"In itself a nice quiet place. Unfortunately, beggars came several times in the last few days and finally knocked loudly on all mobile homes after 9:00 p.m. ... quite a shock, we were already asleep. During the day maybe annoying, but if the cars are already darkened it's a no-go. They heard my anger."

Asphalted, flat and, in addition to a good VE system, also with a beautiful view, as well as several points of interest in the immediate vicinity such as via verde or fuente del rio as a place to visit. The water from the drinking water dispensers tastes fantastic and you can shower in the nearby swimming pool for a fee. Thanks for that!"
11650,2514760,5,Nika4nigth,06/12/2022,"We come from another Area with a negative comment. And on the contrary we want to highlight this wonderful Area. With manual opening door.

11650,1825116,5,Zagal75,15/04/2022,Fairly good. Far from the center but quiet. The worst thing is that some people boast of a motorhome but respect for others they did not learn (barking from their pets at any time). Greenway attached to the area and quite beautiful.

Now, right at the top, they have built this area for motorhomes with individual gray water intake and drainage for each space. It is right next to the greenway.

11650,1168985,5,bikefire,06/04/2021,"Perfectly equipped with all services, except electricity, since it is from the Cabra Town Hall and free. There are 24 places, 2 empty and filled and one waiting area. It is accessed through an opening and closing gate that is normally closed so that the enclosure is exclusively for motorhomes. You also enter by stairs that lead us to the old area, now in disuse. About 2 km away we have supermarkets and the area is residential, low houses next to the hospital. The greenway that connects Jaén to Puente Genil is 200 meters away, and you can ride a bicycle without much difficulty. There is also a profile on Wikiloc of the council itself indicating trails in the area to be done on foot or by bicycle. Rest is guaranteed because with the curfew at 11 pm, the little existing traffic disappears. It is next to an auditorium, now closed. Highly recommended place to spend a maximum of 72 hours, according to the information at the entrance. I rate it perfect with 5 stars."

11650,1059016,2,Burgaillo,19/09/2020,"Few squares, with a nearby park where the boys go drinking and then make noise. It can be emptied and the squares are next to the emptying square. Better than the other Cabra, but bad too"

In summer you can access walking to municipal swimming pools and in winter to heated swimming pool. During the week it is better to arrive in the afternoon because there are many vehicles. Near cheap places to eat next to the hospital. I recommend the Galician Ricón to eat, to five minutes walking direction to the center"
11650,159944,5,juluse,28/07/2017,"Very good for filling and emptying, if you have nautical wc the ideal is that you have flexible discharge tube, you raise the grid and it is perfect. The location is ideal to enjoy the pools, the greenway, and the birth of the river Cabra which is a natural setting with picnic areas, restaurant and grove, is next to the municipal auditorium so you can find some action."
11650,115704,1,Almacar,09/12/2016,It is quite far from the center and there is room for very few cars. The discharge of grays and blacks is placed so that if you have the lateral water outlet the water runs down the street instead of in the grid. Nothing well thought out.

On the parking lot there is a lively coming and going.  Around 4.30 am several women throw dozens of bottles into the surrounding containers and talk loudly.  A quiet night looks different."
11654,436050,5,fsacramento,03/03/2019,Service area to work perfectly. The tap has no thread. The view is exceptional and we spent a quiet night only disturbed until one in the morning by the noise of the fair that was on the other side (Rossio to the South of the Tagus). I recommend.
11654,405763,3,fbrunner,08/11/2018,"We spent 2 quiet nights, maybe because the disco was not working. The ASA is working perfectly. The 2 spaces reserved for motor homes are very tight (especially because one of them has an indicative parking sign that prevents the motorhomes from parking back), which forced us to use spaces reserved for light vehicles (there was no indication that this was prohibited). Nearby, in front of the Tagus, there are public toilets which, although without privacy and without water in the sinks, are usable. The restaurant next door offers lunch (soup, bread, main course-enough for 2 people-, dessert, wine and coffee) for 8 euros. The view of the Tagus is beautiful."

They said they would come to collect, but in the two days that we have been here no one has come. The river praia and its beach bar are fantastic. You can cross to Spain by boat (only people) to Sanlucar Guadiana but it has a worse beach. There is also an international zip line that leaves Spain (only over 14 years old)."

We were alone and totally safe"

You can dump the gray water and cassette and replenish water for free.Small river view. Close to a nice river beach less than 10 minutes on foot (800m). Beautiful village with everything within walking distance (castle, grocery store, river, etc.). There is the possibility of doing activities for example a slide from Spain to Portugal (1.5€ for a boat crossing to Spain and 10€ for a slide back to Portugal (prices per person))."

11655,116075,5,katjames,15/12/2016,"Clean services and free. Level site overlooking the town. Only a short walk. Stayed two nights as town so lovely - nothing special, but ordinary in a good way. Pretty with all the boats on the river. Tuesday is fish day - delivered fresh and locals come out to eat. Prices much much better than on the coast."
11655,96775,2,Fredetdo,18/08/2016,"Convenient, free terminal on site, uncrowded, but the environment is not great ..."
11655,90315,3,usoska,06/08/2016,"A quiet place that dominates the city, free (even for the service terminal). Charming village. Thank you very much to the municipality! On a Saturday night in August, we are only 2 motorhomes. Slightly sloping and dusty soil."
11655,72949,3,oleron,14/05/2016,Very calm. View of the citadel. 5 minutes from the city center. Going there follow the sign Praia which makes pass by a charming way.

11656,2805882,5,roulemapoule29,31/05/2023,Thank you to the municipality for this pleasant park with free services. It changes us from the coast. We feel the drama undergone by the villagers when we walk the streets of the new village of Luz well deserted Thank you to them for their welcome. 5 stars deserved
11656,2798574,5,Michelextr,29/05/2023,"We give it the highest score. Well signposted, very quiet, very clean and well cared for, impeccable urban furniture, litter bins, containers for packaging, paper and organic. It is true that the taps do not have a thread but it is not a problem. The town is cobbled so you have to drive slowly. The environment is highly recommended."
11656,2705778,3,JorgeDuarte,29/04/2023,"Quiet location, but the Wing has some construction defects. Threadless faucets, the water falls to the floor without a drainage grid, wetting your feet. Be careful when leaving with the AC, the ground has a bump and you can hit the rear of the car on the ground, the solution is to go out of gear. Free parking and electricity until you see it."
11656,2687339,4,N.Batista,22/04/2023,"Very quiet, with electricity, water supply and disposal service. also for those who like it, you can observe the typical birds of the area."

11656,2681578,5,alain85,19/04/2023,I already knew this area it has been refurbished and is very functional free for the moment but given the facilities can become payable a visit to the village is essential
11656,2681209,5,carlosfernandes,19/04/2023,very clean parking area all functional and free
11656,2675796,5,luag,16/04/2023,"Excellent 5*, but as they say ""the best cloth falls out of the stain"" 3 taps for drinking water and none of them are threaded, filling the tank can only be done using jerry cans and a funnel or with some art and ingenuity. a hose on the faucet nozzle (?!?!) apart from that ""bigger"" excellent service and rest area."
11656,2668783,5,phildenech,14/04/2023,"Everything is new and free, the payment system is Hs barrier lifted. No thread on faucet. Quiet night. Too bad the village is desert."
11656,2664092,5,silvio135,12/04/2023,"Perfect for one or more nights, you can walk to the lake in 25 minutes. Nothing to complain about for a free parking space. Even electricity is currently free. However, everything has been prepared with barriers etc. to become a paid place in the future."
11656,2663379,5,Zepraf,12/04/2023,Very flat spots. Nice view over the lake. It is only very light at night due to the LED lighting that is placed at every place. Thanks to the municipality.
11656,2646016,5,DavidMirage,07/04/2023,"We have spent two very quiet nights. It is a small town where you can visit the museum, where the true history of the largest artificial lake in Europe is. To visit a restaurant we have to leave the town. Hiking areas. Area of 10 with light, emptying and filling service."
11656,2639515,5,nathalia22,04/04/2023,"We love the area! We felt so much peace and security! What a nice place! All services work perfectly. Gratitude for the municipality providing so much cleaning and organization. The town doesn't have a big market, just a small store (with all the necessary basic products)."
11656,2614170,5,Perramond,18/03/2023,Great area to rest very quiet you can visit the very interesting museum small bakery a Mercado nice walk to do thank you to the municipality
11656,2605965,5,flymo,11/03/2023,"The area is good but small. There are’s bins and a waste water area. It is next to the sports hall and there is a shop a bar and a bakery in town. The town was built recently rehousing the inhabitants when the old one was submerged under the lake. The problem here is the other campers. When I was there it had been taken over by others, they had even reserved parking spots with chairs to stop campers parking there as they wanted to play boules, the cheek!"
11656,2593571,5,dorsetian,28/02/2023,Excellent facility. Pay machine and barrier still not functional. Happy to pay for places like this and support local community. Shame that people still park on waters edge when it is not permitted and spoil the views for others and create more anti-van sentiment which create more restrictions.
11656,2590040,5,oceeme,25/02/2023,"Very clean and quiet. Less than 10 places with electricity and many others in front without that service (which I don't need either). Apart from the impressive Alqueva reservoir, which can be seen from here, there is little else to visit in this clean, calm, orderly and quiet little town like few others. However, it is a strategic point of passage and rest from and to Spain."
11656,2584291,5,Pinheiro,20/02/2023,Very peaceful we stayed one night. It's just a pity that there are no proper taps to supply the water.
11656,2575536,5,Sgnauss,12/02/2023,Very nice and clean place…. Let's hope it becomes paid as soon as possible so the serial profiteers who stay for long periods will be forced to leave the places free!
11656,2564074,5,yannvmc,30/01/2023,"What more ? Water, electricity are free, it's clean, quiet and a magnificent view of the lake at sunset. Only downside for the CC with large wheelbase, it affects the output."
11656,2536638,5,Roady666,01/01/2023,"Spent several days here, as others have commented it will likely become a paying site till then I would happily stay their again. Many thanks to to the village."
11656,2534503,4,fonso66,30/12/2022,"Quiet, flat place, with free electricity. good views of the marsh. It is a town of new construction for inhabitants of towns flooded by the reservoir."
11656,2525903,5,vascoes3940,21/12/2022,"area as said in other reviews soon to be paid for, otherwise we spent 2 nights in peace, the taps for the water not threaded, provide a jerry can or other. you have after the museum a magnificent spot by the lake."

11656,2516096,4,Terumi,08/12/2022,"Good area with all the services and new, very clean, good night, although there was a party at the sports center next door, they did not disturb anything. It has all the elements to make it paid perhaps in the future, I recommend it, thanks to the community for offering us this site"
11656,2500968,1,CO7,20/11/2022,"again blocked by a construction fence. particularly annoying if you drove about 20km to the disposal. Unfortunately, as is so often the case, there is no indication of the blocking. neither with the signs nor with Park4night or Google."
11656,2495726,1,OzeanienArt-on-Tour,14/11/2022,"A challenge for campers with a large turning circle to conquer the entrance! I was able to get to the SP with a 9m camper through an open gate on the other side of the street! VE also placed something wrong! I think it will soon cost something, a pay machine or something like that is already there! If it was a great place, no problem! Quite noisy during the day! I'll be gone and I'll never come back!"
11656,2493057,5,DaPads19,12/11/2022,"Very quiet nights sleep on edge of village.  New, clean, tidy and very well presented site. We didn't use the services though there were other vans who clearly were. I can see the challenge with emptying (see comment below re fence). Could prove challenging for larger vehicles. Visited museum to learn about the moving history of this small village. Thank you for this facility."
11656,2483351,4,albatros21,05/11/2022,"Still not in service? Quiet area at the entrance of the village. Beautiful walks by the lake. Visit of the museum recommended, history of this moving village."

It's finished to a high specification - barrier entry and clearish entry instructions. 
We noted the 3 taps for water refill aren't threaded (!) and the entry to drainage and water fill  area is impeded by the entry fencing."

11656,2314358,2,AnaOliveira3,28/08/2022,"ASA closed. Apparently it will have good conditions, but it doesn't seem to be about to be finished. We stopped next to the future ASA and spent the night with 4 other motorhomes. Quiet and silent village."
11656,2304388,5,pepexj6,26/08/2022,"It was closed! But you could see that it was new, out of the package. An incredible pint, a pity not being able to make use of its facilities. The village of light is very beautiful and funny, I recommend reading the signs that explain its history. There is a pier with beautiful views, ideal for resting or eating, there is also a BBQ and tables near the 24th of July ruins. We will be back."
11656,2254817,5,Jgabriel,17/08/2022,"One of the best I've ever been and stayed overnight, wide area where many motorhomes fit, very quiet and within the town, eviction and free water. I recommend."
11656,2132186,3,Scilash66,27/07/2022,From the comments I noticed that they have been doing the work since February. To date it is not over yet. However it would seem to be very nice as an area. I look for the email address of the municipality to point out the need for the area.

11656,788867,1,ElVeterano,29/02/2020,"Free services, thank you, but nothing else to make us stay here. The museum is a must see to learn how the village was constructed for the displaced people of the original village that was flooded by the reservoir in 2002. A very sad film to see in the museum. We stayed one night at the waters edge just passed the cemetery that houses the dead that were brought up from the old village."

Good to stay for night but nothing special. We ate a breakfast and go further. If you have possibility go to the “green house “ free parking for campers in Monsaraz. Beautiful place to stay with a view of lakes and very very untypical castle! Worth to see!"

11657,2810140,5,abartig,01/06/2023,Great place. Elevated with mega all-round view. The rest is kept simple but sufficient. (5€) not far from the Autobahn just after the border. Quiet night - no other campers. Again and again.
11657,2698850,5,joshelvensteijn,26/04/2023,"Nice place to stand with a beautiful view of the area and dead quiet. All services work, although the shower is dated and you have to wait a while for the water to warm up. There is a bar, which is not always open, where you can have a drink or where cool products are for sale at a very reasonable price. So highly recommended."
11657,2689418,5,skeidarar,23/04/2023,"Generous disposal option with floor inlet, also suitable for very large vehicles."

11657,2665882,5,Klunkertusse,12/04/2023,"Quiet place with a beautiful view of the reservoir and river. Ideal to relax and walk for a few days. There is a small bar with cheap prices. There is a washing machine and dryer, or you can hang the laundry on the fence. Dealers with delivery vans kept coming. One with sausage, ham and cheese and bread. Or grandma with eggs from the chicken farm next door."
11657,2648148,5,oscarmike,07/04/2023,Amazing spot. Beautiful views of surrounding country side.  Basic services but absolutely fine.  €5 is a bargain.  Highly recommend

11657,2600189,5,AKITO,06/03/2023,"This pitch is recommended. You stand quietly, there is electricity, supply and disposal. Almost every pitch has a tap with drinking water. There is also a shower with warm water, but it takes a while. Also suitable for dog owners. The operators are friendly, you can also buy drinks there and sometimes a woman from the neighborhood comes and sells fresh eggs."

11657,2581372,5,Regina65,18/02/2023,"The place is super nice. Everything you need. However, I am ashamed to be a dog owner. You don't even have to leave the square to see dog poo. All the paths are full of dog poop left and right. I can absolutely understand that there are more and more places where dogs are banned."
11657,2581249,5,JackKhousto,17/02/2023,"Excellent value. Reception in French or English, depending on the person...and the generation. Water and K7 services very well, no problem with electricity and yet the area was almost full."
11657,2574127,3,Marani,11/02/2023,"It is a nice motorhome without a doubt, but the 3 € electricity is already full, money in the water. The voltage fluctuates from 180 to barely 200 volts, so that the refrigerator goes into alarm again and again. In terms of environment it is very beautiful, walking in the immediate vicinity."
11657,2572343,4,ChrisRabe,09/02/2023,"Location, hiking trails and view great! place fully occupied. Lots of loud people in the pub, which was totally smoke-filled inside and out. Therefore WLAN use only from 19:00 pleasant."

Beautiful walking area. Very hilly. Bakery and greengrocer every morning on the CP

WiFi is only available in a small area on the upper place and slow so almost unusable. Water on every place on the lower area but not on the upper. Electricity everywhere. In total very good for 5€ but it is not paradise
11657,2493029,5,pasmig,12/11/2022,"Very nice place, with electricity, a very hot shower in a clean room. Several hikes from this place. I stayed there for 3 nights instead of one.

There are many marked walking/mountain trails. The area is open. Just enter and choose the place. Every day a person in charge comes to register and receive payment. I recommend.

Prices for performance with 5 € without electricity with fresh water very good ... almost like being free with neighbors
11657,1792408,3,CharlieFisher12345,23/03/2022,"Great view and a nice spot. Very quiet - lots of wildlife at nighttime. There are showers and a toilet available at the hunting lodge. The toilets and showers are locked and close at 7pm and re-open the next day around 11:00am. Water freely available, big pitches."
11657,1765664,5,sayradan,25/02/2022,"A good place to spend money, a very quiet place and on the way to start a route through Portugal. Very good price for the services they offer. highly recommended"

11657,1749825,3,pascalfa,07/02/2022,Nice place and fair price. On the other hand wifi insignificant and unreliable electricity (voltage drops and cuts) therefore to be avoided. The quality of the reception must be variable... we were not on the good days of the master of the place!
11657,1746388,4,mogette,02/02/2022,"Service area on a height with a superb view. Very interesting price 8 € with the EDF, but it is necessary to expect voltage drops. Only one large shower. From the PR4 hikes, the path is 100 meters away for a distance of 11 km and the PR5 from Odeleite by the GR 15 of 20 km from the area. Pleasant cycling routes almost car-free."

11657,1715053,4,orangebackpack,24/12/2021,"Beautiful and affordable place to spend the night. It is frustrating how the manager locks the bathroom and shower when he leaves and you simply don't know when he does (and when he returns). So we weren't able to use those facilities, though we really would have wanted to."
11657,1676860,3,OzeanienArt-on-Tour,03/11/2021,"Today I was there to have a look, but it was too cool for me because of the wind. I think in hot weather this is a great place and nice and quiet. Also possible for every size mobile home. Mine is 9m long."
11657,1653054,4,Pegasus1905,19/10/2021,"Recommended place! Quiet and very inexpensive (without electricity € 5.-). The restaurant ""Casa de Pasta Albertos"", only a few hundred meters away, is definitely not to be recommended."
11657,1646102,5,gilfannapo3,15/10/2021,Motorhome area which deserves 6 stars ?. Small price and shower? free. Balthazar who welcomes us super nice. In the village Odeleite restaurant Casa Merca very good and low price. Sunset and sunrise not to be missed. In the top

The service are available (fresh water, disposal of grey and black) and also electricity, you just need to leave the payment in the letter box. It gets a bit windy specially at night, and because there is no shade it might get very hot on summer days."

11657,763774,3,fizzghigg,04/01/2020,"Nice view, friendly welcome, large pitches but not all with a terminal nearby, allow a long cable. You need a 3-pin adapter to connect, but they lend it at the association's bar. The toilets are only accessible during opening hours (8 am-10pm, in our case) and you have to cross the bar (not always obvious when you are a woman). Not tested the shower - in a prefabricated by 7 °, I'm not a gamer? - but it has the merit of existing and being great. And it's a hunting association ... so some mornings you can be woken up by cars, barking dogs and the many hunters who meet before the hunt. It's an atmosphere."

Very good also for our dogs! Electricity is 3€ extra. Electricity is good but sometimes in the evening, when everyone is using it, it sometimes is dipping. The view is stunning."

11657,232230,5,brammers,02/04/2018,Lovely little place on a hilltop with views that go on for miles. Surrounded by footpaths and near Odeleite. There is not a great deal to see or do there and access to the lake is difficult due to the main road and barriers. The ampage is pretty low - we tripped twice using too many appliances ! Site only half full when we were here. Baker comes just after 7.15am. Great for tranquility.

No shower or toilet but water available (drinkable) and all possible emptying. Wifi that captures even from the parking.

Here, too, it was almost full of cars, with motorhomes sticking to the edge, where there are trees. Late in the afternoon, when it emptied out a bit, we moved into the shade. Dirt and grass floor, very dusty when dry, we don't know what it will be like when it rains, probably a mudslide. We spent the night well."

11692,2650404,4,Inigoarana,08/04/2023,Large parking lot ideal for spending the night (be careful if it rains) and less than 5 minutes walk from the town. The only thing is the lack of sources and services.

We have seen some campers taking out the sun protector and building an outside table but take care that these are the things that might get you a fine as well as closing the parking for future MHs"

There is also another one just in front of the roundabout, which looks quieter, and on concrete (with water and drainage) Only complaint, the passage of the inhabitants of the city, it looks like be their meeting parking lot.

11692,2493671,5,Mrduppy,13/11/2022,"Agree that this is the better option for overnight stop, even though it's a coach park too. 
We could see that the facilities by the road junction were good but the traffic noise would have been constant. 
Open, flat and large. Close to the beautiful fortress town and great cycling or walking in the hills around."

11692,2371972,4,HoldesWoBi,14/09/2022,Uncomplicated quiet parking lot in close proximity to the old town in Besalu. A bar next door offers coffee and a restroom.

11692,2179607,4,Toyotomi,05/08/2022,"The area, which is next door, although adequate, is small and close to the road; so the majority spend the night on the esplanade of earth and grass next to the river. Good option to visit a beautiful town although obsessed with independence."
11692,2140873,3,Heype,29/07/2022,"Large flat parking lot. Ideal for large motorhomes. No services, but there is a gray water point on the other car park at the roundabout. Perfect for visiting the village. The bridge is 100m away. We did not stay overnight, but it is certainly possible."

11692,1981195,4,AntonioCejudo,16/06/2022,Excellent space. A little bumpy at first but well leveled. You go to bed with the crickets and you wake up with the birds.
11692,1980207,5,TinaMaren,15/06/2022,"Some motorhomes stand overnight, quiet. Restaurants in the immediate vicinity. The medieval town with bridge and gate is worth seeing and well preserved. An experience! For free."

11692,1770881,5,canjulhappy,02/03/2022,We spent a quiet and peaceful night here with many other campers. The town is steps away and there’s a way to walk through the forest down by the river. There are 2 restaurants and public toilets at the end of the parking. Dumping station on the other side of the street.
11692,1769572,5,Cristina4484,28/02/2022,Quiet area to spend the night and next to the town. Great esplanade.
11692,1766728,3,JensenPadalecki,26/02/2022,"It is a huge esplanade surrounded by fields and right next to the town. It is not an AC area, but one more parking lot in Besalú that you share with cars and buses during the day. It does not have any services and in some areas there are some giant potholes that they should try to solve. To spend the night quietly and visit the beautiful town, it is recommended."
11692,1766001,2,Tornjak,25/02/2022,"Free parking in a generally level field. The partially stabilized ground presents a risk of getting bogged down in rainy weather. No service, optimal satellite and 4G reception. The place is perfectly located for the visit of this village mainly known for its very beautiful historical ensemble. A benchmark of Catalan medieval architecture."
11692,1765770,1,Iogi66,25/02/2022,"Fallback situation on this large car park, in beaten earth, with very many ruts, because once again the official area certainly complete is not attractive. At least this car park is not on the side of the road and is located 2 steps from the medieval city. No services."
11692,1761203,4,Ancri,20/02/2022,"Large open space near the access bridge to the town and the tourist office. Soil with numerous potholes. Better to sleep here than in the area, since this is right next to the road and, in addition, it smells terrible. We have spent a quiet night, without problems."

11692,1744506,5,simonsketchley,30/01/2022,Spent two very peaceful nights here with an easy walk into town. Many potholes but just drive carefully. Service point across the road but be careful of grounding as you come off the tarmac entrance road.
11692,1743613,4,Katagat,29/01/2022,"We stayed two nights in the parking lot after looking at the very beautiful city, we slept very peacefully. The V/E station is unusable on the Womoparkplatz. Even teaching the toilet is disgusting!!! The parking lot is better suited as a place to sleep than the Womoplatz! Santa Paul and the volcano with the little church of Santa Magareda are very impressive and worth a visit!"
11692,1721618,1,surferaa,01/01/2022,"We spent the end of the year, and from 11 at night 8 little boys from the town, they were bothering, making noise, spinning with a car, to the point of facing a camper, for trying to open the van, we called the mossos at the beginning and They didn't come until things got worse that it was at 5 in the morning."
11692,1705996,3,nugget98,08/12/2021,"Good place to spend the night and to visit the village, very big and spacious. When we arrived at night there were a few vans and AC but still there was a lot of space, the next day being a public holiday it was filled with cars."

On the panel of the area with the rules there is a sign stuck that indicates that parking is prohibited except cars and motorcycles. I have gone from there to Fuente del Arco, which has electricity and water in each plot, all free. That really is treating each other well."
11695,1637533,1,rodrigo,10/10/2021,"A shame, with how beautiful and well it is eaten and covered and we had to go. very bad access and fatal the tap, you can not fill water."
11695,1598188,3,vitoro,21/09/2021,When it comes to paying there is no one controlling or similar. The reservation is made through the website of the town hall and is paid only by PayPal. There are papers on the streetlights indicating the procedure. Finally we did not spend the night there because it was early and we preferred to continue the route but it looks good.
11695,1159168,1,troll17,28/03/2021,"A shame !!! It was already a custom for our group of motorhomes to make a few stops in this beautiful environment. Walk along its trails, kick the town, consume in its bars, buy a spectacular ham in Los Romeros. We will not go anymore, the abandonment of the area together with the tax collection effort of the city council without any added benefit has taken away our desire. We have paid in many European and national areas, but in a totally justified way (well-kept, comfortable areas, without bottles or noise). A shame. We will order the Romeros products online"
11695,1158402,3,mjbd,27/03/2021,"As of March 26, 2021, I have spent the night in the area. It's open. 12 euros. The light connection is at the extreme end of the area. Difficult to connect to the squares at the other end, which are about 50 or 60 meters away. They have a tap for drinking water without a thread. A hard-to-reach emptying grid. Sewage can be emptied into this grid, but it is not maintained. Full of dirt."
11695,1158202,1,ottis,26/03/2021,"We are probably not welcome here, anyone who offers such a bad place and wants money for it simply doesn't want to have mobile homes. Not worth going there"
11695,1155013,3,palambre,21/03/2021,"We inform all users of the caravan area that we have lowered the rental price of the place, from 20 euros per day to 12 euros per day that appears in the link where reservations are made."
11695,1154571,1,roctry,20/03/2021,"Parking is not free. You have to pay to park, stay overnight and have access to electricity"
11695,1146174,1,Patronio,03/03/2021,The Mayor wants 20 euros / day without having made a minimum improvement in its facilities. 20 euros are not charged even by the best private areas. I will wait for another corporation with more empathy with motorhomes. We will buy the cold meats and consume in other towns in the mountains. How counterproductive is this tax collection effort.
11695,1140082,1,InesPV,21/02/2021,"Fatal, stay away. Abandoned area with erroneous information since parking is prohibited and it does not have a sewage emptying service."
11695,1139456,1,AutoKakun,20/02/2021,"Bad very bad. Area that puts free services and parking at the entrance. We arrived at the area and it is full of no parking signs except cars and motorcycles. We parked outside on the street next to the area and the next morning a man from the town hall comes saying that you cannot park in the area because they have it closed or in the surroundings, that the area is no longer free that the sign is old a long time ago , and that the city council released an app to pay for access to the area. Well, nothing Alanís .... there you stay. Bye!"
11695,1126777,1,davelian,01/01/2021,We were there on 01-01-21 and it was closed and there were a lot of kids with bottles I didn't like it at all
11695,1124572,1,IlipaMagna,27/12/2020,Today I have consulted the City Council's website and now you have to reserve a place to enter.
11695,899296,1,pacoj.,26/07/2020,"Currently as of 07/24/2020, closed since confinement. call city hall before going."
11695,825477,3,amilpin080,15/06/2020,"In the end we were able to use the area for loading and unloading, and a man from P.Civil came to tell us that we could not park inside, but that outside the area, in the plaza, we could park without problems. And so we did, we parked next to the area, outside, and we use the services of the area when we need them. It is not logical, but that's the way it was."
11695,813106,1,fcoivanpm,31/05/2020,"The worst night of my life, drunken hooligans bothering and hitting the motorhome, they even insulted us and threatened us when we got their attention. We even had to call the Civil Guard because my children were scared. I will not go again, hopefully you are luckier"
11695,812973,3,manung,31/05/2020,"We have gone to empty gray water, access is a bit difficult. A fountain, under a sewer to empty, we have not filled but it is a typical fountain tap."
11695,781478,2,famagu,16/02/2020,"We did not find where to throw the gray waters. We were on a Saturday night. Bottle butt, we had to go to another place at dawn. Too bad the people worry about putting up an area and then don't take care of the rest."
11695,768259,4,losManus,13/01/2020,"We stopped 2 nights and very well, the bad filling and emptying is not clear but in the end we solved it"
11695,751336,3,Evajilo,08/12/2019,"To sleep and release gray water very well. But the water tap (the same to fill clean water to clean the poty) is push button and without thread. The gray water drain grate is at the same exit of the parking lot, plugging the exit to the rest when someone empties the waters, and is somewhat strangely placed, so that most people do not manage to leave it under their drain and everything goes away Water for the street. We have had to change town to get water, because here, apart from difficult, it looks very dirty because of the cleaning of the potys"
11695,741255,2,elandaluz,10/11/2019,Some of the people cannot pass without the litrona. Really good people. Night as it should be.
11695,737012,1,DVD,03/11/2019,"The accesses are complicated, very fair and if there are badly parked cars it is difficult to enter or exit. bottle area of young people on the weekend is difficult to sleep."
11695,509932,2,diocogt,09/06/2019,Good parking but they would have to point out where you can not leave if you do not want to take a problem because the streets are very narrow. To thank a neighbor of the town who warned us very kindly on his part. The town has nothing to do with it. To enter carefully with GPS you can take you through narrow streets.
11695,501092,5,Reyesmaster,02/06/2019,Very quiet place and without any danger !! Quiet and cozy town.
11695,487923,4,PJCastro,19/05/2019,Thank you very much to the City Council for having this free area. We have spent a very quiet night. It has what it takes and with many hiking and biking routes indicated in the same area. and right next to the information point.
11695,474853,5,Pedroreiki,03/05/2019,"Parking is free. If you take light you have to pay € 3 per day. On Mondays there is a market where you can not park. There is a box of light sockets, but they are normal pegs. The City Council electrician, very kindly made me the shot. The municipal booth is located so you have to ask if there are scheduled events. Otherwise there are several hiking trails and a castle to visit."
11695,443144,4,bagueraElIveco,22/03/2019,"I found it very good free service, you have to have the electronic triangle key for light. very well located in the center of town. I congratulate the people for the services they provide. A good place to start with bike routes."
11695,440952,2,gusepe,17/03/2019,"On Saturday night, bottle area, the garbage truck passes very early. It cost you access to it to be very narrow streets with parked cars"
11695,408644,3,seantamsin,19/11/2018,Stayed Saturday night and was very noisy. Seems to be meeting area for local youths. Playing music and cars driving around. Maybe just because it was the weekend. Otherwise good parking spot. Unsure where black water was and no hose fitting for fresh water.
11695,405526,5,abravo,07/11/2018,Everything ok You have to take into account that on Mondays there is a market and you have to vacate.
11695,237438,5,tonyzom,16/04/2018,We spent last Saturday very calm and
11695,224545,2,asalloz793,25/02/2018,"Well placed area, we discharged gray water although the grid was full of leaves and the water left the sides. You can not load clean water, you need an adapter that keeps the tap pressed. It was Saturday and at night some guys threw us a Stone to our motorhome and unplugged another car that was connected to La Luz."
11695,223258,4,manusm,17/02/2018,"Very quiet place and in the center of town. The Civil Guard came to be surprised to see a van on a Thursday in the middle of February, but they were very kind and also recommended other nearby areas."
11695,222665,4,joseab,13/02/2018,"Apart from the comments, if you have current in the point indicated in the photo ""AKI"", a very kind neighbor helped us to find it, under the structure, and in the town hall they confirmed the permission. We spent the night very calm."
11695,220121,4,pepelu,25/01/2018,"Centric area in the town. It has filling and emptying of gray and black water, no electricity. See in surroundings, iron hill (perfect by bike), the same lane towards cazalla-constantina station, through the Mediterranean forest. Winery to visit, Tierra Savia , previous appointment to 500m of the town, very interesting."
11695,214652,4,centrodelsur,12/12/2017,"Good area in the center of the town of Alanís. Bakery very close and bars in the vicinity. To empty black water, a small red box must be erected in the vicinity of the fountain. EYE: NOT IN THE SOURCE"
11695,211298,4,ferrary,15/11/2017,Good quiet area with light that is at the end of the whole to fill water although it is pulsador and without threads and to empty the gray sewage I did not find it nearby there is a park for kids and thirteen km from the hill of iron and of the hueznar waterfalls

11695,106965,4,roshr1,24/09/2016,"Good site. Quiet, although in the middle of houses and not close to nature. Also it does not have all the services it promises (light)."
11695,64852,5,Bobby,05/03/2016,"Area very well located in the center of the village office of tourism to 10 m with electricity, emptying point quite inconvenient nevertheless, very pretty lively village. Many things to see around an area as we would like to find elsewhere."
11695,62623,2,emejota,15/01/2016,"A disappointment: there are no services, no electricity or anything. The town is small and uninteresting, in the afternoon you cannot buy bread or newspapers."
11695,53909,4,davidemv,05/09/2015,"Spectacular AC area created by the Hon. of Alanis, centric with all the services and of quality, a but the light if you do not take square near you have to take lengthening of more than 25 m, in the separating niches of the squares they should put tomas schucos, the water intakes must of have several adapters to connect hose."

Flat, shady area, close to the town, the swimming pools, the park house, the adventure park and the hiking trails. The town is beautiful, worth visiting, eating and shopping. Totally recommended."

11717,2972204,5,jacou,16/07/2023,"Nice area, on the edge of the city, flat, just a tap for drinking water will be missing. The city deserves to be visited."

11717,2939611,4,PakitoCalvo,09/07/2023,"It loses one star for the lack of a drinking water tap that has not yet been provided, although this complaint has been made for more than a year (it must be very difficult to do !!!!) sorry for the wordiness is that we went through an epidemic not long ago and sharing this tap for (gray and drinking) is very dangerous for the health of our relatives. Thanks to this kind people."
11717,2872422,3,franjgr,19/06/2023,"To build the area for loading and unloading water, 3 of the 6 places that are theoretically reserved for us were loaded, leaving a space on either side that would only be suitable for campers. It fulfills its function, but separate taps for cleaning Poti and for loading water would be appreciated."
11717,2815126,5,Greygappers,03/06/2023,This is a great Aire fairly flat and spacious. Free with grey and black waste disposal. Fresh water is also available. You will need a compressible fitting to attach a hose to the tap. The town it’s self is wonderful lots to see and do.

11717,2717729,5,Kasku51,02/05/2023,"Visit the Casa del Parque (€1) and do the Los Cortinales promenade. The issue of the only tap, there is a project to rectify it (source: Tourist Office). It has a park and a pediment next to it, where parents should take their children and thus not turn the area into a soccer field and disturb other users. If we do not respect each other among the motorhomes themselves, we are going badly."
11717,2715330,5,autogiotto,02/05/2023,"Good motorhome area, wide, well paved and easily accessible. Very close to the town (5 min walking) perfect to stop and visit the town. we do not spend the night"

11717,2656215,1,carrillodav,10/04/2023,"I spent the night of Saturday, April 1, quietly until at 3 in the morning it became a racing circuit, a car made several laps through the area with shouts, skidding, etc. It was full of motorhomes and campers, although at that time the whole people would be sleeping. After a while the civil guard passed by a couple of times, I imagine someone would call them."
11717,2650246,4,RoberAlvarez,08/04/2023,Very good area! The only thing you have to bring is an adapter for water. Thank you very much AYTO from La Alberca

11717,2599451,5,Gialla,05/03/2023,A very quiet place to spend the night right next to the forest and within the village. I found more caravans and vans. Very quiet if you travel alone.

11717,2595551,3,floid,01/03/2023,"Level, paved parking shared with vehicles and buses. But each one in their marked places. There is an emptying of gray and black with a black tap located just above the discharge hatch. The supply tap is 5 meters to the left of Black's but it is disabled. You have to walk 10-15 min. To get to the center. But it's downhill. We spent two quiet nights."
11717,2586326,5,josemi22,21/02/2023,"August 2022. Quiet place, empty gray and black. There is water for filling. La Alberca spectacular, one of the most beautiful towns in Spain."
11717,2574703,5,Martybhoy,11/02/2023,5/2/23 free stop over in designated car park at the top of the town (which is on one huge slope). Grey and black ok. If your wondering if the diversion is worth it IT IS! The town square look like something out of a movie scene with loads of beer and food places. You MUST wander round some of the streets they are so nice. My favourite stop on this journey to Morocco
11717,2568651,3,PMMA,04/02/2023,"The location is very good. La Alberca deserves a visit. However, I don't understand why the Ayuntamiento still hasn't solved the problem of the clean water tap :("
11717,2545603,5,alhucemar,07/01/2023,"Quiet place and very close to the center. There is plenty of space, at least in this day and age. Town and area that are worth a visit without a doubt."

11717,2529220,5,jonatanpardo,26/12/2022,"Wide area to spend the night, load and unload water and visit the town. We were passing through and we didn't sleep. We recommend buying ham and sausages at Jamones Julián Becerro, at Calle Luciano Barcala, 1. Good treatment and good products."
11717,2524156,1,Urko,18/12/2022,"Bad decision to choose this area to spend the night. We have had to telephone the Civil Guard since tonight the kids from the town have taken to hitting the cars and running away. I went out to catch someone and explain a few things to them, the brave ones ran away. They started throwing rocks at the car from afar. Thanks to the Civil Guard service for the help."
11717,2515261,4,Mendijur,07/12/2022,Perfect and very large area to park. Charging service for electric vehicles. It has a source. Level ground. Recommended to spend the night and even several days.

11717,2492314,4,ferrolmola,12/11/2022,"Very good area, central, level and with all services. Calm, quiet, what more can we ask for. It is our first time in AC, we stayed for three days, we toured towns, we did beautiful hiking trails. We loved the area, we will return more times. Oh, we also take ham, honey, waffles and very good experiences."
11717,2491550,5,amoreno64,12/11/2022,"Free area with emptying of gray and black, the drinking water tap must be pressed continuously and it does not have a thread to connect a quick connection. Good access to the beautiful town that is worth visiting. After several days, the local merchants have expressed their gratitude with the CA visitors for their purchases but also some criticism with inappropriate behavior."
11717,2490974,5,Yeye_trail,11/11/2022,"Users must be reminded of the obligation to empty at the points set up for it, especially those who rent motorhomes, to ask the rest of us if in doubt"
11717,2481667,5,CamiGR,04/11/2022,"I spent one night in this place at the beginning of November ☺️. You sleep very peacefully, the ground is completely level and the people are very respectful. There is a tap for water and also to empty the gray water. Next to the car park there is a path through the woods and there is a small park through which a stream runs. A 10 minute walk from the town center, a real luxury."
11717,2472854,5,Flagoneteros,30/10/2022,very quiet and level area in the heart of the pool. I wish many municipalities had an area like this. Thanks to Ayto.

11717,2464432,4,DaPads19,27/10/2022,"Flat, spacious and quiet with easy access to the town, which is stunning and well worth a visit.  No drinking water currently.   A great start point for longer hikes but the park interpretation centre appears to only open at the weekend.
 Tourist information in the village has some information on hikes, including the 8km Camino de las raices.  GR10 also passes through."
11717,2460152,4,lesglobetrotters11,24/10/2022,Very nice place to spend the night in peace and visit the beautiful village of La Alberca on foot. Parking limited to 48 hours. Easy access for long CC with trailer. The trees could be annoying to park (friction of the branches on the CC)
11717,2456901,4,jonygaiteiro,22/10/2022,"Perfect place to spend the night and to visit La Albeca, a small town with a special charm. Flat car parks with services, the clean water tap does not work, there is another tap next to the potti drain that does work. Let's hope they repair it soon, for hygienic reasons more than anything, so as not to have to fill clean water from the same tap that is above the potti drain."
11717,2450812,4,dirkietje,18/10/2022,A very spacious parking lot with gray water and toilet drainage. A water tap above the toilet drain but no connection possible and I wouldn't use it as drinking water. Therefore no 5. This mountain village is touristy but remains pleasantly cozy. Especially the Plaza Mayor. You can buy delicious local products. Don't forget to buy something at the local carniceria.

The village is breathtaking in terms of architecture, the surroundings are beautiful, beautiful walks to take, a number of fine cafes and restaurants.

11717,1705206,4,anitabom,07/12/2021,Very large and level area. Very close to the town that is beautiful. On this bridge is petado. The failure is the tap to fill water that is not threaded or anything and we had to look for our lives to be able to fill

11717,1155477,4,Bummelsachse,22/03/2021,"A nice, large parking space with disposal options. The city is a pearl. One strolls through small cobbled streets, there are many small shops with regional specialties, very recommendable. We had a very quiet night"
11717,1154496,4,Alzu,20/03/2021,"Very quiet, near the town center, the water tap did not work, so we filled it with the tap for the sewage. For the rest, great, a 10 for the city council for this area"
11717,1152653,4,MrHesse,17/03/2021,"Very at ease. Clean, gray and black waters. Just 200m from the town center and the Civil Guard patrols at night. Perfect with dogs too"

11717,1148867,5,MrHesse,08/03/2021,"Very at ease. It is appreciated to find such a place in this natural paradise. Quite safe in addition, the Civil Guard has come during the night to take a walk and I thank them also that when they saw me with the dogs, after 10pm, they understood that it was a necessity. The food in a bar in the square is very rich, especially the ham, and the walnut croquettes"

11717,1126168,4,cristina29,31/12/2020,"Great area and beautiful town. Now with COVID the town is quite empty, it's a shame. We have been in the area for two nights and great, we have spent about 10 motorhomes and vans. To say a ""but"", the tap is missing thread, otherwise very good. One night we had a delicious burger for dinner that we ordered to take away from a store in the square. In the town there are many artisan shops and supermarkets very well priced. Many thanks to the city council for offering us this area. We will be back for sure."
11717,1125090,4,SoniLui,29/12/2020,"The area is very good, spacious, close to the town and directly overlooking hiking trails. The only bad thing is the water tap that does not have a thread."

11717,1111845,4,lgte,03/11/2020,"The area is very good, it is very wide and there is a lot of space for many cars and motorhomes. Being right on the edge of town there is direct access to nature from the parking lot. The town itself is very pretty and there are grocery stores, bars and restaurants. The only thing that the water tap, apart from being on the sewage spill, does not have a thread for a hose."
11717,1108870,4,CarlosS,29/10/2020,"Ideal area to park and see the town at 2 minutes walk and with many hiking routes. The bad thing about the water tap that you need a special plug, if not, impossible. Narrow but salvageable mountain roads."
11717,1098302,4,NewBartolita,18/10/2020,"Good area to visit a large area, but beware, maybe the rules should be put at the entrance because it skips a lot of compis, the water does not work. Level and between chestnut trees. I would go back, but from Extremadura bad roads."
11717,1088614,5,Pawers,10/10/2020,"Thanks to the city council for this area, it is perfect to visit the area. The pity is that there is so much to visit that in 48. Hours does not give time. Free and very quiet water loading and unloading service to spend the night."

11717,1015978,4,IMF,31/08/2020,"Good area at one end of town, highly recommended a visit to it, close to many routes and trails, right next to a multi-adventure zip line park, next to the municipal swimming pool, in the town you find everything, supermarkets, pharmacies, tobacconist, it is the only parking allowed for motorhomes, 8 places exclusively reserved for motorhomes, although many are put in the bus or car area, we have seen the civil guard pass by and they have not said anything. Well litby with shaded areas, tap without thread so you have to use adapters and press it constantly."

To fill you must have your own hose. The area was quite clean and if we all do our part, it will stay clean."
11717,992115,4,carmelocotonero,22/08/2020,"The filling tap has no water, only the one for draining the chemical and it has no thread. The area behind the drain is full of papers, dirty. Gentlemen, let's be civic with a people that loves us."

11717,956686,4,stayfree11,13/08/2020,"Instead it's great. The problem is the freedoms that some of us take. Chairs and tables outside, families who mistake the place for a campsite. When they take it away we will complain. There are people who usually park cars in the motorhome area for whole days ... I was there for 2 days and some cars did not move for 48 hours. There are also motorhomes that occupy the bus area."
11717,941296,5,SolyBasti,08/08/2020,"A great place to spend the night and get to know the wonderful town by day. We came looking for a place to sleep, but when we arrived we took a walk around the town and we were amazed. Is beautiful. The visit to the town is a must;)"

11717,239394,4,garysajames,21/04/2018,20th & 21st April. A nice quiet area at the top of town adjacent to woodland. Coaches and cars also use the parking area. 9 vehicles here so in high season could be busy. Bins were overflowing but that is the only criticism I have. La Alberca is a stunning little town. Well worth a visit.
11717,235134,3,1000ese,10/04/2018,Ideal to visit the town. Few places reserved but you can use the car ones. Ample parking with gray emptying. The water filling tap does not work. Very calm.

The Saturday market was very small out of season, bit I was only looking for turrón and wasn't disappointed. Tourist shops, friendly bars and a couple of small supermarkets. Swimming pool in season. You can play 'hunt the water tap'! (Spoiler alert - it's in the low wall at the far end.)"

11717,211506,3,kuanillo,17/11/2017,"We have been several times in this area located next to the town. It is easy to access, flat, quiet, but without any services, a problem that should be corrected by the city council if you want this type of tourism to move forward. In November of 2017 there is no potable water (probably due to drought) and there is only the possibility of emptying grays. The filling tap is only valid for filling containers."
11717,209928,3,anaisma,06/11/2017,"There is no water, nor to clean poty Area located at the end of the village on the right next to an interpretation center, where they indicate some trails.

They are very dangerous if you have dogs, because just smelling them can affect them very seriously (you will have to take them to the vet for a corticosteroid treatment)."

Not advised for a quick passthrough stay,  Note that the Google link doesn’t give the right location, but if you came via the shopping street, just continue on that road til you see the camp spot on your left side."

11767,1763237,5,Dibpo,22/02/2022,"February 22, the place very quiet and cozy. Too bad there are only 2 barbecues. In the sports center opposite you can take a shower for €2. I would go back without hesitation."
11767,1744773,4,Raulloji,31/01/2022,"We were on the night of Saturday the 29th, everything was very correct except for some 'disrespectful rude people' in the BBQ area who did not stop putting on a show with full-throttle music and attracting attention until the police arrived and no, they were not ""children"" A very little solidarity with others in my opinion. Thanks to the Police above all and to the City Council of San Hilari x el Area."
11767,1744072,4,Monan,30/01/2022,"We have been the weekend of January 29 and 30 and we have coincided with a large group of campers in the barbecue part. The truth is that they have not bothered us but I do not think that the areas have this function. The police arrived and took pictures of the license plates. The rest of the motorhomes that were on the great esplanade were super correct. Apart from this, the area is very good. We will be back."
11767,1740470,5,oriolrue,24/01/2022,"Large area, fairly level, has the possibility to connect light, empty water ... very quiet, the village is very cozy. there are many mountain biking and hiking trails."

11767,1705735,1,Papartners,07/12/2021,Good idea to park but fix the problems. Light points don't work and they can't do anything from the pool. To make complaints to the tourist office or the town hall. I don’t put 0 because it doesn’t let you.
11767,1705463,4,Aimpe,07/12/2021,Very large area with free water services (too bad you only have one tap for clean and potty). Next to the village
11767,1704331,5,shelcore,06/12/2021,"Great esplanade to spend the night, very quiet"

11767,1699675,5,Glauca1970,28/11/2021,"We have been perfectly down together with another 20. Flat site, with services, if you want you have toilets in it. pavilion and the center of town is very close. Quiet night"
11767,1699220,3,Gabrielpulgar,28/11/2021,"The area itself is very good, but on Saturday night it is 5 in the morning and I can't sleep because there is a disco nearby and everything is rumbling, I also make the worst of the worst. Help. Staying overnight on Saturday can be a bad option if you don't have earplugs."
11767,1689726,4,SOJUPE,15/11/2021,"Ideal for mountain walks, and especially with mountain biking, a quiet night to repeat ourselves!"
11767,1688724,4,LosViajesDeSnaky,14/11/2021,"A perfect area without being especially pretty. Quiet, with a lot of space, easy access and all services. We had a perfect night. The center of St. Hilari is about a 10-minute walk away. Next to it is the sports area with a swimming pool and some paths that lead you into the forest for pleasant walks. In short, recommended."
11767,1688371,4,garnacha1978,14/11/2021,"Well located, there is a lack of light sockets, especially in the lower part of the esplanade, the upper part is also missing and well placed not how they are now, skate area, sports pool, exits to the different sources, in general I give it a 9, if it had more light shots, although it has no shade, it would be one of the best in Catalonia."
11767,1686471,4,Uschnak,12/11/2021,"Nice place, stayed here for 2 weeks. Everything there what you need. To dispose of rubbish you have to get a pin at the gym, but it doesn't cost anything."
11767,1685742,4,regalessia,12/11/2021,"It is becoming a reference site in the area. You can walk to the supermarket, there is a pizzeria nearby and there are several options for children. It parks well and you can do several hiking trips. On a negative level, the uncivil travelers themselves, who do not deposit the garbage in its place and those who throw wipes in the emptying area. It is in 4 languages that wipes cannot be thrown away."
11767,1679283,3,Abril20,05/11/2021,Huge ground esplanade next to the sports center. All services and payment light at the top that fit few seats. And if it rains there is a good climb to the ground. And there goes the youth of the village; we are lucky with the time change and that the cold has started.
11767,1669815,4,vanlife83270,30/10/2021,"Spacious spot thanks to the municipality. On the other hand, the campers last night were disrespectful of the neighborhood, it's a shame!"
11767,1669319,4,kloopempuriabrava,30/10/2021,"Good area, big and with the village next door, too bad the people are a bit irresponsible ... you have a skate park next door and wooded area. sure we'll be back"
11767,1659208,4,RoobCris,24/10/2021,"Good area, disrespectful people are worth it and even doing parking in a square with other cars / vans, then when they close areas like that or put them to us for payment we complain. It is normal. otherwise very well close to the town and the mountains."
11767,1651182,1,GisMo2021,18/10/2021,I wouldn’t drive here with a dog anymore. The whole place lets its dogs run free on the square. In the evening I was harassed by two large dogs. A lock hangs in front of the garbage containers.
11767,1649515,4,camperblue,17/10/2021,"As other users say, many vans in community with tables-chairs-music not very respectful ... But many others that we are. I also AC with tables outside. We are not all the same! In general, very good area, spacious and comfortable."
11767,1648277,2,Paquimaat,16/10/2021,Lots of vans and everyone with tables and chairs outside. It was 9pm and there was still loud music and screaming. In the end we have gone to spend the night somewhere else. Great services.
11767,1646962,4,jordi_284,16/10/2021,"Very quiet night. I don't know if it is allowed to remove table and chairs but groups of vans and AC with everything outside. Bad effect, then whatever happens happens."

11767,1637068,4,Tiggerontour,10/10/2021,"Very large parking space with disposal. I would not use fresh water here, as there is no tap to rinse the cassette, many use the fresh water tap for this. There are 4 connections for electricity on the upper parking space, but they are always all occupied. Otherwise ok - use of the indoor pool is a bit complicated as it is a community sports club."
11767,1635467,4,Cactusevd,09/10/2021,"Very large motorhome area, although a small barbecue area, there is a water connection. We spent the night very quiet. Important deposit of black and gray water. 5 minutes from town with supermarkets, bars, bakeries ..."

Lots of campers, you go to the beach through an electronically secured gate, walk 100m, you have to go under or cross a main road, etc. I turned around because I no longer wanted to go to the beach."

They have charged us for a pitch for a motorhome with all the services when we had not requested any, we let them know and they tell us what it is, for more crime they charge us for the awning service and on top of that he did not have it on. I try to get them to rectify and they don't make the slightest attempt."

At least there is hot water without restriction ... the good part of the campsite, which does not compensate for how expensive it is, is that the beach is in front, you just have to create the road. And that there is a 5km bike lane, which goes as far as it goes, I think, that goes through the natural park, and is super nice, quiet and away from any road. If you go to the campsite, it is highly recommended a walk there, by bike or on foot."
11817,452764,1,Krissa33,11/04/2019,"I went for the water service (emptying and clean water), it's impossible. The lady at the reception told me that you have to spend the night to be entitled to it, and they do not have a price only for the CC of passage. I passed my path"

There is a terrace at the campground, for drinks. Wifi works, for now only at reception building, but they are working on creating a bigger Wifi range. The only downside is the church bells, every 15 minutes between 8am and 10pm. Recommend!"

11835,2555802,2,parknight1731,19/01/2023,An unglamorous area located in an industrial area. Surrounded by metal sheds and entirely concreted. We had a place in the back of the area wedged between a wall and wire mesh panels and 16.50 euros for that. Correct sanitary facilities but no pressure in the showers. Just good for troubleshooting one night

Police passes regularly, lots of shade, 30 m from the entrance to a park with free-roaming ducks and geese, ideal with children. The bustling city center with a multitude of chic boutiques and numerous churches is at the end of the park by crossing the bridge on foot. I recommend, watch out a lot of mosquitoes in the evening."

We settled in the parking lot to eat and take a nap, a strange gentleman on a scooter went back and forth and looked very strangely at the motorhomes parked. We quickly left"
12031,2194968,1,IsabelPortas,08/08/2022,"The location is very good, but what is emptying and filling is really disgusting. It's all that overflows with the dirt of the potis and smells bad, we have never seen such a thing until now. We went to the other area that is in front of a gas station and very clean."
12031,2160761,5,jonanereas,02/08/2022,well prepared site and close to the center with a park with a lake next to it.
12031,2155684,5,RoberMB,01/08/2022,"Quiet place and close to the center. With large seats. In summer beware of mosquitoes, being next to the river there are many. Our caravan was filled to capacity, even with the mosquito nets, and we didn't sleep a wink."
12031,2131786,5,CapitanClick,27/07/2022,"Phenomenal. It is the second time that we come and we like it for how quiet it is, how close it is to the center and for the amount of space there is for the ACs"

12031,2084354,3,Miguel.AFuentes,17/07/2022,"We arrived and left, not for anything bad, we just didn't like it, we thought it was a bit sad, apart from the facade just opposite there was construction going on and we imagined that from 8 in the morning, there would be noise due to the work. We went to another area 5 minutes away."

12031,2010722,3,kalamandrullo,25/06/2022,"Location near the center. It lacks a bit of shade, but overall it's pretty good. The access for loading / unloading a fair bit for AC of more than 7 mt. The only drawback is that some places are occupied by AC people from Palencia and it begins to look like a garage instead of an AC area."
12031,1966443,5,ramfarre,11/06/2022,"Great location to visit the city. Very well signposted access. Large spaces around a parking lot that make up a closed area that is a bit noisy at nightfall due to the continuous entry and exit of vehicles. A little shading would be appreciated, but apart from this detail an almost perfect area. Be careful, at this time, with mosquitoes, the area is surrounded by water….."
12031,1961232,4,Andrea-Dinis,09/06/2022,"Very quiet area, with good spaces, correct emptying and loading service, a bit small for large cars but it can be unloaded well. The only thing that we had to leave early because it was very hot and there is not a single shadow."

The only two buts are that the gray download is a bit small and that it gave me the feeling that the locals take the opportunity to store their ac here (still, plenty of room). Thank you Palencia"

12031,1812654,5,EdGer,09/04/2022,A perfect pitch. Near a park. Near the old town. Close to beautiful walks. A joy for man and dog. The night was extremely quiet despite being a normal car park.

I do not give it five stars because the loading and unloading area is separated from the parking spaces and has an entrance with a complicated maneuver for large ACs due to the proximity of the parking spaces"
12031,1781349,5,Belenjo,12/03/2022,"Perfect motorhome area, close to the center and with all the services, to put a snag, the tap for filling drinking water is not threaded or round, which makes filling the tank a bit difficult."
12031,1777314,5,lasarastark,08/03/2022,"Quiet night even on weekends and close to the city. During the day there is a lot of movement of cars and people. Lots of police rounds, sense of security. Services in perfect condition."

12031,1740237,5,lufizer,24/01/2022,almost doesn't get any better. Quiet parking space is near the center and next to a beautiful park. Dogs are forbidden here. But there is also a meadow opposite the road. 17 spaces for mobile homes up to 9 to 10 meters and another 6 spaces for 6-7 meters AC. Disposal is a bit tight for large motorhomes. But it works with a hose.
12031,1731930,4,MONTYK2,11/01/2022,"Beware of the GPS that puts you on a closed street today. As you pass the bridge, look at the signs that indicate the motorhome area. quiet place to sleep and in 5 minutes walk you are in the center."
12031,1728724,5,antuanrocamora,07/01/2022,"Large spaces, there are two in which another motorhome would even enter next door and with loading and unloading services. The only one but that being in a parking lot early in the morning there may be movement of vehicles that go to work and also that we had the visit of the municipal sweeper quite early and at night by a herd of ducks from the park but in overall very good"
12031,1719514,5,oceeme,30/12/2021,"A quiet and safe space, within a generic car park, but with spaces marked and reserved for AC (in camper I don't think there is a problem). As the squares are spacious and being next to a park, it is not as claustrophobic as most tarred spaces. Of course, be careful because if you arrive from the north, the GPS guides you through the pedestrian access (through an alley that overlooks the park)!"
12031,1718707,4,nanoyoda111,29/12/2021,"Well leveled and good places. Good location to visit the center. But the service area leaves a lot to be desired. If it measures more than 5 meters it is difficult to get in and out. Without hose connection (there is a simple tap). Difficult to clean the poti (yes, empty). With a more cared service area and fewer mosquitoes (like cuffs) it would be an excellent place for a couple of days."

Be careful when entering the emptying area, facing backwards, the neighbor told us that it was the third fence that changed because it was thrown down."
12031,1700272,5,maria41,29/11/2021,"Very good spot with free WiFi. Toilets and showers were closed. You can buy Gas bottles at the petrol station.

It is 500 m from the entrance of the main street of Palencia where you can walk, go shopping and visit the city, in a safe area and with a beautiful park next to it full of ducks, ideal for children. With all the services."

Many squares, very wide and level, and if there was more shade it would be great. True about the mosquito plague. We used mosquito nets, repellants and anti-mosquito tablets ... but despite that they managed to enter ..."
12031,1370850,5,helixaspersa,27/07/2021,"Great area, very close to the center at 7-8 min. walking. Free water change services, only the tap without push-button thread, but at least there are. Park next door for kids, and with ducks. The bad thing is the mosquitoes that are a plague, and despite the mosquito nets they attack you at night.Thank you Palencia, the recognized beauty"
12031,1359267,5,hermandad,24/07/2021,"This area is unbeatable, large with some shadows it is next to a park and river and also very close to the center, the only drawback is that the Christ of the hill is far away, otherwise a 10"
12031,1338374,4,gabilandia,18/07/2021,Good area in a car park with ample parking spaces and an unbeatable location to visit the city. Quiet to sleep in front of a park. Shade is missing and the filling tap is from a source where it is not possible to put some type of adapter to hook the hose.
12031,1322302,4,salberes,14/07/2021,"Thank you very much, to whom it corresponds, for this wonderful area, with all the emptying and filling services, very close to the center and with a park next to it, very walkable.

12031,1298631,5,josecr,05/07/2021,"Thank you very much to the city council of Palencia for having provided this area with all the services and so close to the center and so well prepared. To put an improvement point, perhaps the entrance for the gray casting could have a bit more width because when parking cars in front of it, it makes the maneuver a bit difficult ... but it can be done perfectly like this ..."
12031,1294837,3,jlm7707,04/07/2021,"Area on a car park with several spaces reserved for Campervans (about twenty), marked out pitches. Close to town center but calm. Free services (no electricity). A nearby park to stretch your legs (many jogging tracks)"
12031,1290552,4,astoriano,02/07/2021,"The truth is that a great place to spend the night. The only bad thing, at this time of year, that despite the mosquito nets we were eaten by mosquitoes. Even if you only open for a second, they are in droves. Otherwise, highly recommended."
12031,1281477,5,Antoniopurchil,27/06/2021,"Central, clean, quiet and FREE, whoever uses a non-threaded tap should look into the chest with a drawn tap, lift it up and open the threaded sockets on the side. The access to the emptying area can be improved, with a larger one of 7mtrs, it may be necessary to do some maneuvering. Google maps indicate wrong but there is correct vertical signage. there are garbage and recycling bins."
12031,1274243,5,KurkUdi,24/06/2021,"Although there are people, from what I read in a comment that they prefer to sleep next to the water drain, I suppose they like the smells of the Poti when emptying and being at the entrance so that all the vehicles throw their smoke and noise. .. in my opinion it is very good, easy to get to, well signposted, free services (except electricity), quiet area next to a park and two steps from the center."

The caravans at the end and at the entrance of all the waters, and if you want to use it you have to turn around, leave and enter. It is where the cars. People seem to love it. I can not understand it"
12031,1232311,1,susanaarevalogil,02/06/2021,"I have just arrived. Google Maps signals you badly at all times. I've been going around the center of Palencia several times. And then it does not make sense that all the black, gray and water filled water is in the car part, not at the end where the AC. I have come for the good comments, but if I know, it does not occur to me to come. No way"
12031,1226721,5,Unagolondrina,30/05/2021,"Great: safe, central, quiet and with plenty of places. Be careful when loading water, it is the center manhole and the taps are at the bottom, at knee height ... There are two threaded tap taps, in two different sizes ... I didn't see it at first. If it is done on the tap on the right, it is square without a thread and you need an adapter, in addition to having to press all the time. Thanks Palencia"
12031,1213113,5,Quicolas,23/05/2021,"Fantastic area with many squares and central and free services and plenty of walks and parks to go by bike or on foot a stone's throw. Also a beautiful and welcoming city with a lot of atmosphere. Be careful with the water filling system that is in the middle, not on the sides, so many people get confused or find it difficult to charge because they do not have an adapter. It is loaded in the middle. So much"

12067,2621546,4,AnkeRolf,23/03/2023,"Parking space in the marina. There are certainly better, more modern pitches. For us, however, the price-performance ratio was right. Everything you need as a camper is there. It's ok for a night or two to visit Seville. The bus into town stops not far from the square. A recommendation from us."

They also have them to take away. We will be back!!!"

I will soon forget this place...."

It took us a while to get there because there is an iron gate that, if it is closed, has a bell and they open it immediately. There were few places so I recommend arriving early in case you don't have a place later. The only drawback that I could put is that the bathrooms are a bit seedy, for the rest everything is phenomenal"

The toilets had no toilet paper and hardly any water came out of the showers, the shower heads almost fell apart and the water alternated between scalding hot and cold. Unfortunately it was a bit disappointing. Otherwise, for €15 a night, it's ok."

With shade from the trees and the awning. There is also tap water directly at the pitch. The noise at the weekend was also limited. We can hardly imagine a better place for a tour of Seville.

Great for getting into the city by bus (tickets from the driver, return in Seville starts exactly at the same place you get off) ! Some deduction for the really not very clean sanitary facilities, hardly any water came out of the women's shower. Popular tapas bar in the harbor (Fri/Sat), since it was rel. loud until late. Good pizzeria!"

About half an hour by bus 140 to Seville, a bit difficult by bike. The way is described at Komoot. Wifi very bad, plumbing is just fine. If you want to park the car safely it is a good alternative."

A bit tricky to find entrance as gate is set back in a service road from the main road.  Toilet and shower block a bit tired but great restaurant next to Marina, used by locals too so can get noisy at night at weekends.

Relatively calm, at night ok, by day it's a port! 15 euros in November plus 3 euros for electricity. Pitches not all equal in terms of user-friendliness but in any case the interest is the visit of Seville. The departure being before 12:00 to have space and perhaps to have the choice, arriving around 10:30 am 11:00 seems wise to me. Friendly staff, really I recommend. The GPS coordinates of the entrance gate (doorbell on the left) are: N37 ° 20´21 ""W6 ° 1 '26"" No indication then vigilance the indicated GPS did not take us in front of the gate but in a path closed by a gate (end of the shipyard)"
12067,1689705,5,Maintal,15/11/2021,"PRO: ⬆️ Super quiet ⬆️ Nice location right on the river ⬆️ With drainage and supply ⬆️ Hot showers ⬆️ Bus stop in front of the door Cons: ⛔ Toilets and showers very dirty ⛔ Only two showers for the entire space ⛔ Price of 15 EUR / night not cheap For us 5 stars, because it is currently (2021) the best parking space in the immediate vicinity of Seville."
12067,1686308,5,hedwigr,12/11/2021,Super quiet for sleeping. The woman at the reception has an extensive explanation and a folder. Good and safe cycling route to the center. Only downside: not immediately a restaurant nearby (pizzeria was closed). Most depart between 10am and 11am. After 12 pm the most beautiful places are fully booked. Stayed here 2 nights.
12067,1684539,4,tabrox22,10/11/2021,"Nothing super fency, but ok to visit Sewilla. Very close to bus, 1,6euro to center/ person. :)"

12067,1682123,3,7suko,08/11/2021,"You have to arrive early if you don't want to find yourself between the toilets and the repair garage like we did… Very old toilets, rusty shower and not very clean. No toilet paper when we arrived. Do not take the blue card… 3 stars for peace and easy access to public transport to go to town."
12067,1682108,5,mathetmath,08/11/2021,"We arrived in the late afternoon there were only 3-4 places left, so plan to arrive early. A bit noisy in the evening due to the presence of two restaurants on the other side of the port. Otherwise calm during the day and very pleasant with the port on one side and the river on the other. € 15 in low season, € 20 in high season. 3 € / day for electricity."
12067,1682002,4,UTenTHUS,08/11/2021,"Safe place near the city. Pleasant atmosphere and excellent facilities. Fills up quickly so be on time. Bus to center about 20 minutes. 3x per hour on weekdays, 1x per hour on weekends."

12067,1680184,2,gj78,06/11/2021,"Quite disappointed, stuck between the toilet and the repair garage. very basic sanitary facilities. staff blah. answer after 10 minutes ringing to return. very very average."
12067,1679802,5,henniez,06/11/2021,"Beautiful place (we stood along the water for 2 days), with all facilities. Safe. Access to the harbor is locked at night. Arrive early otherwise, even in autumn, it is full or you have one of the lesser spots. Supermarkets close by. There is also an attractive Italian restaurant on the site. Sevilla can be done by bike (9 km), but the cycle paths are not always logical."
12067,1675571,4,butfun,03/11/2021,"Best to arrive earlier in the day when others are leaving.  Condition of shower and toilet needs improvement but usable.  Washer €3.50 and dryer €2 on site.  Bus stop outside into Seville €1.65 pp each way.  Staff helpful, location nice.  Recommend"
12067,1675524,4,Sylleke,03/11/2021,"Nice managers, friendly night guard. Bike path to Seville. We arrived at 13.00, they thought with us for a place with two campers. Arrive early, 13.00 everything full."
12067,1675003,4,Stozi,02/11/2021,"The gentleman at the front desk was super nice and uncomplicated. Narrow places, clearly on this and this demand. Unfortunately there were a few toilets and showers, but relatively clean. On the whole good place."
12067,1672354,5,genussbus,01/11/2021,"Really idyllic on the river, with sailing boats in front of it. Some places are fantastic, as there is a lot of space for table and armchairs. The city can be reached quickly by bus and metro, we rode our bikes 35 minutes to the center"
12067,1671664,4,LC06,31/10/2021,"A very nice place to sleep peacefully while being 20 minutes by bus from the center (line 140, one bus every 30 minutes). The services are however not very welcoming with a trap for black water in the ground to be lifted. The setting by the river is pleasant and the night was calm. I recommend."
12067,1669333,5,Fordusha,30/10/2021,"Really nice chilled place by the river, has pizza restaurant on the grounds. Make sure you say hello to the lady called Diana (she is 90 years old and lives aboard one of the yachts in the marina) she has lots of stories to tell! Free hot showers and toilets, nice walk by the river for the dogs. Bus stop to Seville is right outside."

12067,1656493,4,SjoerdJansen,22/10/2021,"Half an hour by bike to Seville. Spacious places, if you park parallel to the river, you can extend an awning if necessary. Shower, toilet, washing machine and dryer not very luxurious, but fine. Very quiet at night, in the evening indeed a bit noisy at the restaurants. Ability to obtain power with both CEE connection and normal EU connection."
12067,1655173,5,JohannaJohnny,21/10/2021,"Perfect. Nice and quiet, and at least every 20 minutes a bus (140 or 143) goes directly to the center!"

12067,1652329,2,Alain196802,19/10/2021,"Place to really spend a night, good noise in the morning because of the boats, road noise, house noise and restaurant next door. Staff not very smiling it seems that it pisses them off, accept only cash and let them know. A water terminal for 5 motorhomes and if you do not have a long hose, hello the galley."
12067,1651195,4,sm4shing,18/10/2021,"Really suggestive camper area .. in a tourist pier by the river .. current and water, loading and unloading, toilets and showers (do not try) .. bus just outside the pier .. to the center of Seville it takes about 30 minutes .. on Sundays certainly a little more as buses run like 1 every hour .. however with taxis with 10-15 euros the problem is solved."

12067,1598803,3,rmpotrony,22/09/2021,"A good place as a base to visit Seville. Next to Guadalquivir. All the services. The only downside is that they do not accept cards, only payment in cash."
12067,1596443,2,TobiasProebster,21/09/2021,"It could actually be quite nice - the location is very good with a view of the river and the nearby bus station. However, there is only one shower and one toilet. Washing machine doesn't work (which we found out after our laundry was already in) and nobody cares. Staff is rather unfriendly and annoyed. Little is offered here for € 15."
12067,1595248,4,entropie,20/09/2021,"Very nice place on the port, showers, toilets, there is a bus stop for Seville next door. 15 € without electricity for 24h00 is very correct.

12067,1577697,4,Guarrillero,14/09/2021,"A good place to see Seville but a bit improvised taking advantage of the fact that there are hardly any places nearby, it has a washing machine and dryer, bathroom and shower, although movement of workers in the morning the bus can be caught by taking the 140 to 200 meters from the area and it leaves you in the Main Square"
12067,1572240,4,jivet,12/09/2021,Nice location in a small harbour with few parking places. Good starting point for a bike trip to Sevilla city center. One toilet and shower for men and the same amount fo women is not enough.
12067,1562492,4,Archelon5,09/09/2021,Mostly full at 5:00 p.m. 26 'by bike from the center of Seville. Not found better in terms of peace and security to visit the old town.

12067,1445743,5,losafe,12/08/2021,A good site. It is very difficult to find anything to stay overnight for many kilometers. Very friendly guards. Recommendable. In the nearest bar (Seispies) very good service.
12067,1443687,4,Chacat,12/08/2021,"The coolest area to visit Seville, good access, views of the Guadalquivir, buses every 20 minutes to go to Seville. We took line 140 and it dropped us off at the Torre del Oro. On the way back, the same pick-up site. To put one downside, the bathrooms need more cleaning"

12067,1422791,5,Tricasses,08/08/2021,"We stayed here for 2 nights to visit Seville. Right next to the bus. Line 140 but 143 also goes there. Very pleasant setting in the marina, therefore at the water's edge. We were able to take advantage of the cool water and the shade of the trees to eat outside morning and evening. Shower and WC available. You can fill with water and empty gray water, but nothing for black water. Very quiet and bar right next door."

We stood there for one night (from Saturday to Sunday) and found it to be quite quiet. The sanitary facilities were clean. We took the bus to Seville (the plans at the bus stop and the Oficina were not up to date, so it's best to scan the QR code, you will find the correct travel times there)."
12067,1357611,3,Asi13,24/07/2021,The site is fine. Cooler than Seville. Very well connected to the center of Seville by urban bus. The services are those of the port. Near the plots they have several water points. You park in line and there is not much space. The plots are not well defined. The mornings are noisy from the activity of the port. There is a nearby bar which is also noisy at night.
12067,1345909,5,boirsen,21/07/2021,"After posting a positive opinion, nothing changed, except for the bike lane. It is not from the area, and it is not continuous, it is cut to pieces making you doubt where to go, and going through dangerous areas, a road without a shoulder and without any shade at any time. We went with children and it was a mistake."
12067,1337983,5,Louna2015,18/07/2021,"We are in front of a black gate, it is the entrance to the port of Gelves and therefore to the service area, ring the bell and we open the door to you. Nice, by the river, calm. In the morning to go to Seville, the bus stop is close (we missed the bus, so we took the taxi, number given to the service area) and we quickly got a car, Spanish Steps 17 €, 4 people. Thanks Parkf4night!"

Recommended and would definitely stay again :-)"

The negative, one shower for men and one for women which overflows no shower curtain.  Seems bathroom only cleaned once a day.  Internet bad intermittent and slow.  Bring long cable if you want electrical. Seems primary focus of business are the boaters."

12067,1255442,4,KIKINADI,14/06/2021,We were lucky ... few people 5 pl / 20. Very satisfying if there is a place in the shade like us that evening. Spent 2 nights wc shower Elec washing machine. I recommend. very friendly welcome. nearby bus to Seville.
12067,1251972,4,Carlaaucoin,13/06/2021,"Good place, quiet, by the water ... there is some shade. Friendly welcome. The sanitary facilities are dilapidated but clean. Finding the entrance to the camper van area is not easy. You have to enter the port and go through a gate. (there is no indication). For two nights with electricity: € 36."

Electricity goes to part. The brochure tells us that the departure is at 09:00, but when we arrived as there were few ACs, he told us that we could leave later without any problem. We went by bus to the center of Seville, it passes very close and every 15 min."

12067,1177639,5,lkwlkwlkw,22/04/2021,"So glad we stopped here - we were a little concerned after reading some of the comments but thankfully we didn’t have the same experience: the people working there were lovely, the showers were hot, we never had to wait for the bathroom and we filled up easily with water. You feel really safe and it’s so easy to get into Seville via the 140/141 bus that goes from just outside the marina (you take it back from the city from exactly the same place you get off - we were wandering around looking for a stop on the opposite side of the road! Bus is 1.65 pp cash only). We also walked into Seville via the canal path - wouldn’t recommend it - bit dirty and run down at points without much to look at but would’ve been fine to cycle). All round great experience and very reasonably priced for a city campsite in a really pretty marina with 24/7 security."
12067,1177208,5,elorapanais,21/04/2021,"We loved staying there. We stayed there 2 times, it's quite quiet, the staff is very friendly. We were able to make the machines with a large capacity for 3.5 and drying 2. we went to seville by bike, there is a path that runs along the guadalquivir, but it's still a good distance to get to in the city. We also liked the shower, closed and with hot water."
12067,1174436,2,Yvonnereist,16/04/2021,Unfriendly staff. You always have the feeling of being disturbed. Electricity did not work. Location is good and quiet despite being close to the city. But only 1 toilet and shower each for men and women that is not enough. You have to be lucky if you want to use them and they are free.
12067,1174113,1,ldavinci,15/04/2021,"The location is good, about 5km by bike to the city center. Service (reception, shower, wifi) is more of a star. Internet does not work or works very slowly despite a good WiFi signal. The sewage emptying is an imposition with many flies."
12067,1157035,4,glueck2002,24/03/2021,"Nice place. Womo is safe because the port is guarded. Possibility to stand directly on the river. Even places. Bike path goes straight into town. Nice local nearby. Animated but not too loud. We would come back anytime. Wifi good, but not in all places."

The reason for this is a city visit to Seville and there is this RV park at the port very well located. Above all, he has everything you need and is safe.

All that it is to offer parking for vans already deserves gratitude; in this case the best, without a doubt, is its location, sleeping between sailboats and together to the Guadalquivir, at the gates of Seville. For the rest, bathrooms with showers say justitos, and expensive electricity (I realized when we saw that we were the only ones plugged in) but still clear that I recommend it. It's a bit difficult to get to, I recommend asking when you see them nearby, you'll save trips on the highway."

For us with toddler then a little too much."

Be careful because there is a ""stray"" dog that lives there (it's very good) but it eats all the shoes and clothes it finds outside, so before you sleep make sure you put everything inside. In general, it's not bad for a night."

12146,2725962,5,labeni,05/05/2023,The area is very good. Everything as in the description. We have been coming for many years. The only problem is the payment machine. It fails a lot. And in the evenings there are no staff present. We had to call the emergency telephone number for the area and the boy really didn't take more than 20 minutes to arrive and we were able to pay him in his small office when we wanted to leave.

12146,2665846,5,Klunkertusse,12/04/2023,"Nice cheap spot, especially if you manage to stand right on the quay. Even saw dolphins swimming by. And some storks are nesting behind the square. The place has a lot of charm. At the weekend there is a small market with lots of delicacies on the square in the center. Two km to the beautiful almost deserted beach. Or you can take the ferry to Spain."

12146,2650671,4,Papoumigrateur,08/04/2023,"Nice area, not expensive. close to town. Do not arrive late to hope to have a place facing the river. Garbage and sorting on the quay."

12146,2592865,2,gfenn05,27/02/2023,"too many permanent campers. The place has lost much of its charm. Two women work at the reception. Only speak portuguese. The black-haired woman in particular certainly didn't invent working. If you want to pay, she refers you to the machine. But it hasn't worked for a long time. Everyone knows that. The man is very friendly and also speaks English."
12146,2590703,1,JeanD,25/02/2023,"This year it was not possible to find a place, perhaps because we arrived at the weekend, but above all because of the clearly displayed ill will of the very contemptuous dark-haired woman at the reception. Should choose another profession because it really deserts this area and does not give a good image of this small town that we like."

12146,2571933,4,robert717,08/02/2023,Great place to stand. Sometimes it is full and sometimes there is room again the next day. Take into account your departure time and intake of water and discharge. Is a good base for visiting Vila Real.

12146,2568267,3,Volkeryuma,04/02/2023,"The parking space lives from the proximity to the town center and from the low price. The place has everything necessary. Good for 2 or 3 nights. The environment of the square is much improved compared to last year. Disadvantage at the moment: The place is full, especially because many have settled here for a longer stay. Including many LuxusWomos with trailers and second cars."
12146,2561838,1,kaihietanen,27/01/2023,Weird place. No understanding why anyone would pay for staying here. Some form of RV skid row.

Had to stay overnight in front of the square. Disposal was possible, but without sewage disposal. Somewhere a generator is running at night, which was only drowned out by the cooling unit of a truck. Couldn't sleep well."
12146,2526620,3,Vierterstockrechts,22/12/2022,"Except for the individual fates in the comments, it's just a place to stay near the border and not a luxury place. Office manned from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. parking attendant friendly; Even the fact that the ticket machine didn't work was solved manually without any problems! Night was quiet, you can dispose of grey/black water and re-bunker the fresh water tank. Everything for €5 + €0.5 per person tourist tax. So it's totally ok!"

12146,2384184,2,Milky,18/09/2022,"The location of the place directly on Guadiana is good. However, the nature of the place leaves a lot to be desired. There are stones, gravel and dog excrement lying around. The price of 5 € and 50 cent tax is okay. The electricity price is quite high at €5 and what is not okay is that it applies 24 hours a day from 8 a.m. to 8 a.m. If you come z. B. at 6 p.m. 10 € electricity fee will be due. That's rude."

12146,1785861,1,SimonandVicky,17/03/2022,"An over crowded car park, pay at the machine on the way out, EHU available if you can find any!  Yes town within easy walk but as in a commercial area it was noisy at night. Unfenced dirt lot."
12146,1784777,4,jps54,16/03/2022,An area at the water's edge so noise from the boats but does not disturb beautiful location shops nearby
12146,1756010,3,1957mezieres,14/02/2022,motorhome area well in the ground a little bomber with I think a lot of people waiting to leave for Morocco
12146,1746620,1,penhoet44600,03/02/2022,Area which only has the merit of existing and being well located. Dirt parking little space and saturated. When at the reception consistent with the unfriendly parking lot and no effort.
12146,1742830,2,mogette,28/01/2022,"Okay, the only interest is to be able to go shopping and visit the pleasant city center, otherwise the environment is not folichon."
12146,1742059,3,YanaPez,27/01/2022,"Functional, but very very large. Almost too many campers, with people blocking off spots with their bikes/trailers."
12146,1738913,4,DorsetDrifter,22/01/2022,Popular site with many long termers. Stayed two nights. Lots of café bars and restaurants around. 5€ plus 50c visitors tax. Good stopover and will return.
12146,1719077,3,travel_bnmr,29/12/2021,"Great to visit the city. registration was not possible during Christmas Day, but also not necessary. pay at a machine and you can drive out again. Furthermore, somewhat desolate terrain with a nice view of Spain, or of your neighbor because you are close to each other."
12146,1705535,2,Sujai,07/12/2021,"They have deceived us because they have charged us € 5 for the stay and € 6 for electricity, which we have had to pay by hand to the woman who has attended us. It is not an area, it is a wasteland next to the river where you can connect to electricity, load and discharge water. They serve you in a sentry box on a fairly limited schedule and he's not the nicest person in the world."
12146,1699535,5,kaffeeamstrand,28/11/2021,Were only here to fill up with water. You can fill up the water for free without having to drive to the parking lot. Very convenient!
12146,1691822,4,Drownedrat,17/11/2021,Great  place due to proximity to lovely town and cheap facilities. Best spots overlook the river and across to Spain if you arrive early. Ferry to Spain 5 mins walk ! Good lunchtime restaurant on site and bread van called by in the morning. Would definitely return.
12146,1675267,4,chenon,02/11/2021,"Rammed earth car park opposite the quay and very close to the town center. 5 € per 24h plus 0.50 € tourist tax per person to be paid to the lady at the entrance who we found very friendly and ready to help us. We do not understand the previous opinions, the person is very pleasant and very patient, compared to the behavior of some motorhome operators and god knows if it takes (patience)."
12146,1665489,4,arturicoacho,28/10/2021,"Land parking, in front of the fishing pier. At night very quiet, you can rest well. The employee of the area is not very friendly."
12146,1660956,4,MichelMichel,25/10/2021,"It is not the big luxury, but close to the shops and town center. Beautiful walks to do around. On the other hand, the prices are: 5euro the site 0.50 € / day / person for the tourist tax If you want electricity it will cost you 5euro for 24 hours.IMPORTANT to know: you must reserve your electricity before 2pm! If you arrive later, you will have electricity the next day at 8am."
12146,1650035,5,amilpin080,17/10/2021,"Villarreal never disappoints. Good area for € 5 / 24h. 5 'from the center, full of shops. Good bars to eat. 5 'Lidl in a motorhome with places for motorhomes. Villarreal bets on this tourism."
12146,1649294,4,judithacha,17/10/2021,"Area 5 minutes from the center with many places you pay € 0.50 per person of tourist tax at the window in your schedule and € 5 for 24 hours in the machine outside the area area with charge and download, Wi-Fi and electricity if you request it ."
12146,1636748,1,Txelleta,10/10/2021,"Land parking, in front of the river, many mosquitoes. We arrived at 5:00 p.m. and there was no one to attend to us and to be able to connect to the light. Great location just off the main street. When paying, the machine only accepts a fair amount or a € 10 max bill. otherwise he keeps the ticket and does not give change. The staff that attends the parking a bit unpleasant."
12146,1615194,1,Vivemartinique5,28/09/2021,"I'm not in the habit of criticizing, but here, I think I'm not too unfair because this service area is deplorable in a degulasse environment (sorry for the term) so much so that I only stayed 4 hours the time to go shopping. I paid 5 €, plus 0.50 € per person for the tourist tax I find that it is quite simply racketeering."
12146,1521630,4,Alcacp,28/08/2021,"Enabled space, for € 5 it is well at least safer than on the street and you can fill and empty. It smells a bit bad being next to the water. there was a lot of movement"
12146,1508017,3,PauloGoncalves,24/08/2021,"Great location (next to the river and close to the city centre), but it's a shame the surrounding area is so run-down. Operation of services leaves a lot to be desired. Dump zone simply disgusting."
12146,1472943,1,rubenfaria,17/08/2021,"Too bad, water space and slop always dirty. there is a very arrogant and rude Employee. I asked for the Complaints Book and he refused to give it to me. I had to call the psp to the site and report the situation"
12146,1447732,3,claireetmicka,12/08/2021,Very good for one night. € 5 with water and oil changes. Good starting point for visiting the city and going to the beach by bike!
12146,1445632,1,helia85,12/08/2021,"An open field left without light, nothing more. We arrived at night and no information or posters anywhere. Bad smell of the river in some moments (that if we understand) but no one responsible for any side. Last option if there is another place in the area. If you go, better go with coins and incidentally. I still don't understand the € 0.50 extra per person. Some inexplicable and inexplicable service."
12146,1399124,3,luciaps026,03/08/2021,"The payment of this place is made in cash, with coins."
12146,1399115,4,luciaps026,03/08/2021,"Parking near the center of town. They charge you € 5 every 24 hours. They include basic services of the motorhome. The other services are paid separately. So that they do not charge you the next day, you have to leave minutes before the 24 hours have passed since you entered. This place is recommended to avoid fines for parking motorhomes in places that are not allowed from 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m."
12146,1357959,4,RAlmeida,24/07/2021,For the price it's good I could just be a little more careful!!!
12146,1351571,4,boirsen,22/07/2021,"Field without shade, space to spare, magnificent views. There is a beach bar in the same area that makes grilled fish to death! recommendable!!"
12146,1343230,4,chessy,20/07/2021,"Well situated, good for visiting the city of Vila Real de Santo António, next to the port and 5 minutes from the centre. Next to the ferries to Ayamonte, perfect for a day trip. Electricity is paid separately and if we need it we have to book it before 8am, if we arrive in the afternoon only the next day will they make the connection. You don't understand why."
12146,1273459,1,Soniagarana,24/06/2021,"We arrived at 9:00 p.m. There was no one at the reception but there was a machine to make the payment that was in very bad condition. It did not accept cards, 5 euro bills or coins. We tested with coins of 10 cents, 20, 50, 1 euro and nothing. It was impossible to make the payment or enter, so we had to leave."
12146,1243120,5,DanielMira,08/06/2021,"Very well located, great for visiting the city."
12146,1228140,4,AlbaMobil,31/05/2021,"Very nice, with a view of the port and in the immediate vicinity of many small shops and restaurants"
12146,1227383,1,susiunterwegs,30/05/2021,"I arrived around 7 p.m. and looked for a place with electricity. When I arrived it was a bit off-putting. Cats were walking around a lot, everything neglected but I thought I needed a place. I pulled a ticket, went in and looked for a seat. Then I wanted to connect the electricity but it was locked, I was looking for someone but there was no one who was responsible. So I decided to drive again. A permanent camper helped me to pay for the ticket and said there was no electricity today and I had to pay € 5 for 25 minutes"
12146,1227367,3,Carloscalvoconde,30/05/2021,"Excellent place for its strategic place next to the river with the possibility of going to Ayamonte by ferry or to San Antonio on foot. It lacks almost all the time of personnel who report and lend a hand, therefore very difficult to contract electricity, without toilets. The rate is € 5 / day, but they charged me ten euros, I think I was between 23 and 24 hours ... the machine to pay does not return change. Bicycles, ideal for going around. Still I will repeat."
12146,1210408,3,pacoj.,22/05/2021,"Quite large area, the price of electricity is € 5 every 24 hours, price per day € 5 parking, very well positioned next to the Guadiana, in front of Spain."
12146,1208690,4,Perdi2xelmundo,21/05/2021,Large area a step away from the center and with exceptional views of the Guadiana and the shore of Spain. Good access and quite quiet at night.
12146,1194392,4,DC.1989,12/05/2021,It is not in the best area but it is correct and cheap.
12146,1153033,4,Claire21,17/03/2021,"Area that we recommend. Very nice view, close to shops and town center. Beautiful walks to do around.

If you arrive later, you will have electricity the next day at 8am."
12146,1151206,4,Alice.Ramy,13/03/2021,"Simple area with basic services. A bit monotonous and not pretty to look at, but the city is very close and very nice to visit. The quiet night."
12146,1129245,3,MasterVanTeam,08/01/2021,"Plain square not fenced, no bathrooms etc. Laundry room is across the street but good and laundry has wifi, not in the campsite. Gloomy place but for 5 euro a night with service and access to electricity it may be, but for me it is for one night."
12146,1124837,5,lufizer,28/12/2020,"Well, there are no sanitary facilities, but everything else a motorhome parking space needs to pass through. I can't understand the bad reviews. We stand very nicely with a view of the water and to Spain. Great place to stroll a beautiful promenade with a harbor not far from the square. Also for very large motorhomes. The lady who receives the tourist tax is very friendly."
12146,1120998,1,chrisku910go77,13/12/2020,"The lady at the front desk VERY rude! Today, Sunday, December 13th, 2020 at 11:50 am."

12146,1060061,2,jumpinjackflash,20/09/2020,"Correction: I was wrong! it's not 10 € / day for 24 hours, it's 10 € / day with electricity, which makes us 300 € / month, anyway ... sorry!"
12146,1060035,2,jumpinjackflash,20/09/2020,"Attention: the price is 5 € / 24h ok, but the electricity, for the lucky ones? it's € 5 from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. and € 5 from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. or € 10 for 11 p.m. ... and therefore € 450 for those who would have the idea of spending 1 month there with electricity ... more expensive I don't know, even in France!"

12146,995540,3,AnabelaMartins,23/08/2020,"You pay 5 € per night 1 € tourist tax per person. Park on dirt but spacious. There is water available and the possibility of dumping. I think that for so many users they could have one more water point, there are times of the day when a long line is formed. It is close to the village, easily reached everywhere on foot. During the night it is quiet."
12146,952756,3,Pedrinha,11/08/2020,"For 5 € you can use the park to sleep, electricity, pour dirty water and replace clean water and wash the toilet."

12146,795073,3,Perrot86,13/03/2020,Good for visiting the city and its surroundings. For electricity it is necessary to reserve and there are few sockets. We stayed 3 days without the possibility of having electricity. Reception closed on Sunday afternoon.
12146,794237,3,Chris66440,11/03/2020,"Very close to the city, too bad some French people let their dogs wander and shit everywhere."
12146,791901,1,siemonsma,06/03/2020,"Arrived at 2 p.m. First impression messy. Later after the kosk went for connection to Electra there was nobody present. Put the plug in a working socket. Around 7 p.m. the plug is pulled out and the cupboard is locked, running to the kiosk with my wallet in hand and asking for Electra connection. This was not possible until 8 am the next day"

I do not understand more ... next time I plan to pass my road"
12146,769119,1,Souky,16/01/2020,And one more star so as not to put zero lamentable welcome closed permanently. Nothing works no security the barriers blocked in an emergency how do we do it? To avoid
12146,766591,1,Souky,09/01/2020,"The only advantage is to be in the city center, 5 € for electricity ditto (when it works) taxes 0.50 € / person it is expensive. The parking lot is dirty and the reception nonexistent damage with an effort from the town hall, it could be good"
12146,763112,3,jlchazel,03/01/2020,"Convenient parking to visit villa de san antónio, a little noise at night but nothing more. Negative bridge, there is electricity for 15 connections so if to the right of the parking lot there are long term motorhomes as is the case at the moment, there is no more power for the large parking lot of left. example: on the right about twenty sites and 12 connections, on the left 250 sites only 3 connections (look for the error) and if unfortunately you share the current then a camper in the parking lot on the right comes to lecture you !!!! to recognize it it's simple it has been spread out for months on the same site !!! I hope that the municipality will be able to put order in this parking.Otherwise water and drainage ok."
12146,754698,1,heleneS,18/12/2019,Arrived today person not very pleasant who tells us no electricity to call several days in advance to have it therefore not remained there.

12146,744135,2,LYP,17/11/2019,Less negative than the CC below have no electricity paid 7 € including tourist tax. If the parking was less dusty it would be reasonable. I notice that the CC met want everything free including their own nuisances and contradictions!

Negative: electricity with few connection points and only in the central part. We noted little care for conservation, cleanliness and lack of interest from check in staff to good service"
12146,683499,1,mickpamg,09/09/2019,"We drove into this aire to find the office closed at 2 pm.  This aire is a large dusty car-park about 500 metres or so from the centro.  The area along the waterfront has no electricity, the parking to the rear of the aire has power boxes.  When the office is closed the power boxes are locked with you leads inside.  I spoke to several motorhomers who stated the power drops out regularly if you put on more than the fridge, no air-conditioners in other words.  As the power boxes are locked they cannot be reset if they trip.  We continued on to Ayamonte, the aire at the marina is excellent."

12146,558196,3,RamonKTF,17/07/2019,"Take into account that the cashier to pay, only accepts coins and € 5 and € 10 tickets, although it appears that also accepts those of € 20. And they do not give change in the booth of the ""tax"" payment"
12146,556330,3,RamonKTF,16/07/2019,"Esplanade of earth and stones fairly leveled. Before arriving at the barriers, stop to register and pay tourist tax in the booth that is on the right, then collect the ticket at the barrier. To leave, you have to pay for the stay with the ticket in the machine next to the booth. A bit uncomfortable."
12146,547376,3,Ritalia,10/07/2019,Good for a stop / visit. Bizarre this tourist tax ...
12146,540993,2,lolo.,06/07/2019,Visiting this area since last summer this year 5 times and every time I come I was more disappointed until this time that I do not come back anymore. The right side does not stop neither parking nor pecnotar. Since they began to charge the 0.50 per person the place is decallendo. When you could enter 24 hours now it is only 8 to 20 hours.
12146,506834,5,Baenasl,07/06/2019,"Closed from 8 in the afternoon to 8 in the morning. Because although the access is paid by automatic machine (which allows access at any time), they have ""INVENTED"" a tourist rate of half a euro per person, which is collected by an employee of flesh and blood, which is only from 8 to 8 With which all the modernity of the automatic payment, they have loaded it: and on top they lose money,. . ."
12146,488995,4,poupette60,20/05/2019,"Not too bad, well located. there is just this absurdity to want to charge the tourist tax before entering the area if not the barrier does not rise and suddenly access is not possible after the closure of the checkpoint."

12146,445007,3,einstein56,26/03/2019,Hello large practical area for all sizes. 4.5 euros per night plus tax stay 0.50cts per person. this is not deserved but it is quiet and secure and ready for the city center with a multitude of small shops and restaurants with good prices. do not miss all these shops there is something for everyone. this saves a little my opinion on the area of C / C
12146,442376,4,Louise71,20/03/2019,"We spent two nights, functional and quiet area. Welcome in French. The lavendière passes you get your laundry, 1 € 50 5kg: washed, dried, ironed on hanger and protective cover, do not hesitate, very friendly person who speaks French.

12146,440497,1,pladys,16/03/2019,"Now at € 4.5, you must add the tourist tax € 0.5 per day and per person to pay separately before returning. It's really anything, instead of adding it to the price of the day, if I could I put -4 stars."
12146,440035,1,Jjl25075,15/03/2019,I stayed there a few days ago. Today I go back to just empty the tape and I'm asked disagreeably 4.50 euros. Bravo we force us to empty wild. Especially as 4.50 euros is for a night with service. We did not pay and this charming little ball insulted us. It had been several years since we stopped here. It's finish.

Nice scenery But you are woken up by the sounds of the boats coming and going which is why I only have 2 stars. I woke up 3 times last night by the sound of very loud fishing boats going past

12280,508567,3,heatherdale,08/06/2019,Fair place to stop just a fair walk from the town. Refuse big bin provided. Brilliant for watching the boats going in and out. Not for light sleepers as the oil tankers had very noisy engines with a 5am high tide

12280,89833,4,chrismarie45,05/08/2016,Very good for one night after spending 3 nights at the campsite next door. If you are a sinner this place is for you. The passage of large boats is not disturbing at night. Otherwise very nice place to visit the surroundings. I find this place beautiful!

12299,3074095,5,Einal,04/08/2023,Quiet place near the river. We spent the night there in a van + tent (not easy to plant sardines there because of the hard ground). There are even two benches and underneath on the path below a drinking water tap!
12299,3048334,4,ViagensDaquiParaAli,30/07/2023,"Second time we stayed here. A very quiet place and next to the highway. There is water and there are places in the shade on the other side of the road, by the river."
12299,2590780,4,Duzifahrer,25/02/2023,"Very nice pitch on the water. The sound of the river drowns out the highway. Fresh water works even at -5 degrees. Beware of motorhomes with a large overhang, the descent is short but steep and when it rains you can easily get stuck in the meadow when turning!"

Not so good for swimming, a local resident recommended that we simply follow the river a little further to get to a nice bathing spot, but we didn't try it. Directly on the street, which is hardly used. Faucet was perfect for refilling water"

It is a restaurant with a large parking lot. You have to go deeper into the village and find a hedge of trees next to the football field (by the river). The location is on the right before the small green bridge."
12299,1373149,5,MRWAYN,28/07/2021,Suuuper nice parking space right on the river. To the left of the bridge you can go swimming in the lower area. And there is even a rope swing to swing into the river. HAMMER :)

12299,783042,5,chrilou71,19/02/2020,Very good after a good day on the road. Allows you to relax with the murmur of the river in a rural area. The tap between the two benches works very well.

A tap free access, what luxury! And an awakening in the shade not insignificant. No trash, think of the bags. Nice find thank you!"
12299,163423,5,Cocci,02/08/2017,"Very quiet and cute despite the desert landscape around. Well go to the bridge of the river. We got to the bottom of the driveway with trees and benches (on the right just before the bridge). We were in the shade this morning. Be careful, if you do not go up to the bridge, on your right, it's just a kind of large parking all flat without shade next to an old factory, not super sexy ..."

12299,128185,4,credelsp,16/04/2017,"Flat, quiet, away but 2 minutes from the motorway, not very pretty but ideal for a break of one night. Access can be complicated with big motorhome but in vw california, no problem"

12378,2724661,4,stephanjl,05/05/2023,"entrance a bit difficult to find with the works. quiet grassy area. all services. payment by app a little complicated but we get there. that said never seen any control. town center 2.5kms. simple, clean toilets. hot shower provided you let the water run for a long time the first time. perfect, thanks to the city"
12378,2720082,3,beaelx,03/05/2023,Very good area. Sad the attitude of some motorhome drivers by not collaborating with the town hall by contributing €5
12378,2685766,4,Norfri,21/04/2023,It's already the 4 or 5 time we've come here. It is very quiet and the police pass several times a day and night. Worth the 5 euros/day. I recommend
12378,2675464,3,hedwigr,16/04/2023,"Good camper place 20 minutes from the center. Arrived on a Saturday at 5 pm and still plenty of room. Way too difficult system to pay, download app first etc. Please do something about this because this sucks. Keep it simple"
12378,2670520,5,SrPoche,14/04/2023,"Good place, quiet and safe. Access to Bathrooms and proper functioning of the App."
12378,2662983,4,wichiflu,11/04/2023,"We do not give it 5 stars because the way to pay is a bit confusing. You have to use the ""Osona Territori Camper"" application. First you have to register so that when paying the registration appears. We had to call the tourist office to make sure we had done it right and also to get the bathroom pin. The showers warm but ok."
12378,2653270,3,EmmaDC,09/04/2023,"The area is fine, but there are places unusable due to tree roots or because they have a large difference in level. What is ominous is the wc-showers. We came here because there were showers and the water was cold and they were super dirty. We couldn't shower. Alert because a code is required to enter the toilet, you must call the Tourist Office and they are not open on Sunday afternoon."
12378,2646030,3,Beachbelle,07/04/2023,"good to visit the beautiful old city of Vic, aided by the tourist route walking map from tourist information, 20 minutes away. Too many campervan owners with dogs off leashes plus one that barked constantly during the day. You pay 2 x €1 coins for 100 litres of water, only about 50 came out, the pressure is weak. Filled our bottles at fountain at top of approach road."
12378,2639404,3,siscuriba,04/04/2023,"Area in a beautiful environment, close to sports facilities. The price of light is excessive."
12378,2636516,4,superfamilyonroad,02/04/2023,"Very good area! Good location, toilets with code more or less clean, emptying center correct but paid. What a pity that we can only stay two nights, since we have spent 3 days in a sports event, we need one more night, and we don't know if they will have fined us..."
12378,2627353,4,hilger,27/03/2023,"Nice place for the night. The payment with the app didn't work, you have to get a ticket from the tourist office 2 km away, which is checked by the police. There you will also get a code for access to the toilets and showers"
12378,2618883,4,LukeSargeant,21/03/2023,"€5 to park up for the night, water and electricity are extra, however good location to visit the old town. Follow the 'ruta turistica' for a great tour of the old town. Bottom row of pitches are the flattest."
12378,2608660,5,BmcNil,13/03/2023,A 10 for the Vic town hall! Thanks for this area!
12378,2607224,5,Albertcal,12/03/2023,Municipal area very well equipped. It costs €5 a night. The payment app didn't let us choose the payment method and we paid at the tourist office. They give you a code to be able to use hot water baths and showers. It is a 20-minute walk from the center.
12378,2606475,4,kimyjop,12/03/2023,"If you don't arrive early, call Tourist Information to get a WC access code. Night is paid by App. Everything very clean and well maintained."
12378,2600126,3,Jane23,05/03/2023,"Complicated payment process via an app, also due to weak internet on site. The machine is taped shut, so it is not possible to pay with cash on site. Arrived here on Sunday afternoon, no PIN for sanitary possible via tourist information, as it is closed. Space is ok with seating."
12378,2587842,5,lolo1025,23/02/2023,Very nice area. Perfect for a stopover and visiting vic. Plenty of space to play with the kids and walk the dogs.
12378,2582696,3,Jessica3393,19/02/2023,"Very quiet area, on the outskirts of the center, but in 10-15 minutes you are in the main square. It is paid, €5 a night with the App. The services are also paid. The police spend the night to check the license plates for payment, otherwise there is a penalty. Water, waste and light."

12378,2548955,4,kimlafon,11/01/2023,"Quiet and sunny place, near downtown. Go to the Tourist Office 4km away (5euros per night) if you want access to the toilets and shower, you will have to ask them for the access code. (moderately clean bathrooms and lukewarm showers but it helps) Don't bother paying for parking if you don't need these services"
12378,2547153,3,felisaares,09/01/2023,"The rest is good, no noise but the bathroom is closed and when you finally get the code to enter (you have to call by phone) it is dirty. In addition, we bought the 3h of light and the battery did not charge so it does not seem that it was 3h."
12378,2537056,2,Marc-In,01/01/2023,The place is very nice but you can't pay for it and use the sanitary facilities more complicated.
12378,2533992,5,XeviPA,30/12/2022,"First of all, thanks to Vic City Council and Osona Territori Camper, for this fantastic area. Just 20 minutes' walk from the center of Vic, in a very quiet area with all filling and emptying services. In addition to very clean showers and toilets. The stay is €5 per night and is paid through the app. Water (€2) and electricity (€3) must be paid with coins."
12378,2530339,3,michtopelo,27/12/2022,Very well did not have the passage to pay for the location on the other hand provide coins of 1 € for electricity and water otherwise perfect to visit the city 15 minutes on foot or 5 by bike
12378,2527777,5,Peroquecardes,25/12/2022,"Good place to spend the night in Vic, quiet and close to the center which is about 15 minutes' walk away. There are fees for the stay but they NEVER fine anyone so if you don't need water or electricity you don't have to pay"
12378,2526799,2,Pneumotox,23/12/2022,Area on campus. Young people prowl at night with loudspeakers. Police intervention… I advise against…
12378,2526680,4,zizila,23/12/2022,"great place for few nights. located by the athletic stadium in quite part of the town. few campers around every night, but not too busy. local police visits when going around too.

you need to pay using the app, which is bit clunky to use initially. there is constant humming noise coming of the motorway, but it is manageable."
12378,2526219,4,Ron200,22/12/2022,"In 20 minutes you are in the old town, which is well worth seeing. The parking space is well located, spent a very quiet night. Only 4 campers."

12378,2523209,3,Galle88,17/12/2022,"Nice place, very quiet with a park next door. The night from Friday to Saturday I listened to some disco in the background, although it did not reach the threshold of being annoying. Regarding water, the machine is broken or the advertisement is a lie. It indicates €2 - 100l but it has hardly filled even half a tank and it was not completely empty!!!! so I don't think it even reaches 50l, less than half of what it indicates."
12378,2523136,4,ingrid87,17/12/2022,"Good place and pretty. You pay €5 and part of the electricity 3h €4 and water €2 100L. Regarding the water rate, it is a lie. It has filled me 1/2 deposit."
12378,2521121,5,wolfi128,13/12/2022,"Good location and good services. Only one, but, the machine only works with 1 euro coins. If you have 2 you can not use. Thanks to the town hall for enabling an area."
12378,2518094,5,joanmagrans,10/12/2022,"I give it five stars for the environment and the location 15' walk from the Plaza Mayor. We have already come several times and we will return. Some things to improve: ...shower services, at least on the 9th, do not have hot water. ....the light only works with 1 euro coins and a bit expensive (€4 for 3 hours)"

12378,2475104,4,jcastellp,31/10/2022,"The area is very good. A 20-minute walk from the center. The reservation management system, a disaster. Right now the area is full and reservations can still be made. A paid car has just arrived and there is no place for it. The municipal police came, told them to go somewhere where they wouldn't make noise, but surely there is someone who hasn't paid and hasn't told them anything. Very bad."
12378,2474328,4,esbofamily,31/10/2022,Very good place to sleep but the services do not work. We could not download the App to pay. The tourist office was closed and we couldn't pay or use the showers or toilets. You should look for some other system to pay and use the services.

Didn't use the shower block."
12378,2433359,5,RicardArderiu,09/10/2022,"Excellent, quiet place, ten minutes from the center of Vic on foot, and with super clean services and showers. Highly recommended!!!"

Only negative point payment via the application did not work for me, I had to go pay at the tourist office. The municipality should review the system because many motorhomes do not pay the 5 euros and ask you for the code to enter the toilet block. Lamentable!"
12378,2388017,4,MarjoleinVanDriessche,20/09/2022,"Beautiful spacious pitches, all amenities available. Very nice in green! Too bad about the many loose dogs, otherwise a great place to visit Vic, a nice town."

Downloaded app, but despite 30 min to get it to work it refused to take payment. Shame - I would have liked to have paid. Waste water dump. There seemed to be showers and electric - but showers needed a code we didn’t have. Good spot."
12378,2329797,5,javimetal,01/09/2022,"All right. The app works. Access to toilets and showers works if you call for the code. correct waters. 10 minutes by bike from the center, which by the way, is worth it. We will be back."

12378,2270954,3,herloes06,20/08/2022,"The area itself is very good but the payment process does not work well, if you arrive later than the tourist office hours forget about being able to use the bathrooms since you have to call them to provide you with a code to open the door, They should change the system."
12378,2258580,5,Josepcarrasco,17/08/2022,One of the best areas for equipment and price. Showers and bathrooms in very good condition for €5/24h. It is necessary to improve the payment through the app because the last time it did not work.

Just one little thing, the machine only accepts €1 coins and we were missing one, so we had to walk until we found a bar to change."
12378,2187673,4,Norfri,06/08/2022,"Excellent area for A/C, some shade and unevenness adjusted with shims. To pay the 5 euros stay you have to access the App, the police pass by and say nothing, it is a pity that some take advantage and pay nothing. It is 1.8 km from the main square, with bars and restaurants and beautiful buildings. There are fairs on some Saturdays, see the tourist office."
12378,2171358,4,txoritxikia,04/08/2022,"The area of 10, but there is no control. The police pass but do not see if you have paid. Parked cars and people more than 48 hours. The bathroom goes with a code, but those of the tourist office give it to anyone. a pity"

About 20 minutes walk from the town center and 5 minutes from the supermarket. There are several areas of this type in the Osona region (there is a sign indicating them)."

12378,1828556,5,marcdop,16/04/2022,"Nice and quiet area. You pay for all services. Maximum 2 nights. Too bad there are uncivil people who pee, wash dishes or teeth and throw it on the ground (berlingo type vans, cars that stop to sleep, or some vans).

The center of Vic is 30 minutes away on foot. Nice price (5€/night) but complicated to pay: you would have to load their app but it didn't work, go to their site but there was a bug. In short, I managed to pay my 5€ after several attempts."

Shower / toilet are a bit inconspicuous in a small building where you might think it belongs to the neighboring property. You can get a PIN for access by phone from the Tourist Info. Be careful in the English description there is an 8 too many in the telephone number!"

It has to empty gray and black waters. For those who have dogs, they will be able to take them out right next door."

The only downside is that the electricity machine comes with € 1 coins and every 3 hours you have to put the coins in to get light. Not suitable for people with a CPAP machine if you want to sleep often ... otherwise excellent. Good views of hot air balloons in the early morning. Go soon, there are only 20 places."

12380,2515893,3,riscojavier,08/12/2022,Good area. With level ground. You can hear the passing of the cars that pass over the bridge but it does not disturb sleeping.

Thanks to the community for this opportunity!"

12380,2495729,1,Raancene,15/11/2022,"Here, the city administration has given little thought to the need for rest of travelers in mobile homes. The cars constantly driving over the rattling highway bridge resemble a Chinese water torture! We didn't sleep and left at dawn."

The local police went on patrol at 11pm, and at 11.30pm a hooded man who was watching the caravans tried to steal our bikes and ran away when he saw us.

12380,1915177,2,madadu13,25/05/2022,Helps out well for one night. Do not stand too close to the bridge to limit noise from the bridge. With each car that passes there is a noise. Otherwise quiet with free services. Close to the city convenient to visit.

It may have been some kind of business they were doing, when we saw people sitting in cars and calling. So it did not feel completely safe. We saw the police come by from time to time. But we stopped and nothing happened. The cars on the bridge can be heard when they hit, but after 23.00 there was not much traffic."

12380,1730335,3,GureLevante,09/01/2022,"We spent one night, the parking lot was almost complete, it is located next to the river, and under a bridge. To sleep we did not hear the noise of the cars, we recommend it to spend the night if you are passing through."
12380,1728287,2,Bernardette,06/01/2022,Well located to visit Tortosa. Then we left because the noise from the road is unbearable to sleep. We do not recommend it to stay overnight.
12380,1726328,1,lapiluquita,05/01/2022,"We arrived in the area at around 11:30 PM. As soon as we arrived we saw a very bad looking man looking among the motorhomes. We left immediately because it seemed like a very unsafe place, be very careful please !!!!"
12380,1722739,3,bkb,02/01/2022,"Large tarmac car park on the banks of the Ebro. Easily accessible and practical water and drain services. Cycle path and vast promenade that runs along the river to reach the city. Admittedly, the area is located under a very busy bridge, but the night was quiet and the noise very attenuated in no way disturbing."
12380,1719924,4,dwk262,30/12/2021,"Flat parking with capacity gives security to be with more motorhomes and about 10 minutes from the center, with bike lanes. The downside is that it is under a bridge that when vehicles pass it sounds a lot but it is not bad. No problems overnight."
12380,1713829,1,bernardvoyageur,21/12/2021,noisy with the bridge and traffic just above ... it doesn't inspire safety
12380,1710085,4,jwinn,14/12/2021,decent place to stay! not too pretty but it's a free carpark that feels very safe..was with around 5 other campers last night.
12380,1702651,2,EGPH,04/12/2021,Really nothing special. Noisy because of the overpass and not that close to the center. The drain is convenient but the load is very bad because the tap is not threaded.
12380,1698300,4,Congers354,26/11/2021,"Exellent motorhome only park up under a main road river bridge with about 30 spaces. a 20 minute walk into the city which is well worth it for the castle and fortifications. 
some road noise but i dont think its going to bother us. seems pretty quiet and safe."
12380,1694038,4,Met0,20/11/2021,"Very nice city to visit laundromat 6 minutes walk expensive, with wifi Thank you to the city! just a pity that the tap with valve and no screw is above the cassette emptying, this encourages filling with the external tap which has no screw thread"
12380,1686356,4,womo1211,12/11/2021,Fresh water has no screw thread. Car bridge quite annoying. Otherwise very good.
12380,1685893,4,lalavanstory,12/11/2021,"The night is well spent, perhaps it is not beautiful but you feel safe next to so many motorhomes and campers and you also have services such as water and gray water drainage to get ready for your journey."
12380,1676259,4,afineta,03/11/2021,"The area is good, flat, adequate services, and 2 km from the center walking. How bad you are under the bridge and every time a car or truck passes you hear the clack-clack of the bridge…. Eskerrik asko tortosa"
12380,1657329,5,soleillange,22/10/2021,"Very practical area, flat, and very close on foot to the town center, by tree-lined path along the Ebro. No noise, apart from the traffic on the bridge, not really bothersome at night. Thanks to the city of Tortosa for this equipment. or"
12380,1603378,3,xondi,23/09/2021,"A very correct and quite crowded area, with large squares. The water filling and emptying area is very clean, but not without an unpleasant sewage smell. The area is under a bridge, the noise of cars passing is constant, but in the end it turns into white noise. There is a self-service laundry within a 10-minute walk, opposite the police."
12380,1538280,1,olivierb44,01/09/2021,"Correct and well placed area. 1/3 of the pitches are occupied by caravans of marginalized people, and we continued our journey. It would suffice to charge a few euros per day to avoid this type of situation. Pity."
12380,1515030,4,EliasRiquelme,26/08/2021,Good area. except for the noise from the highway which is not exaggerated otherwise well. bar and supermarket 5 min walk. there were few people for the dates that are.
12380,1468665,1,Nightr,16/08/2021,"A paved area with rather large squares, ideal for emptying and leaving, non-potable water. Very unsafe at night, the police often pass but there are quite a few individuals with not very good pints browsing the motorhomes. Drug trafficking at night in front of the area. We had to pick up and leave at midnight out of fear. COMPANIONS, BE CAREFUL PLEASE !!!!"
12380,1428254,4,JORDI2EURA,09/08/2021,"It is a well located area, even if the services are not correct. The water should be potable and the space for the toilet clean, which belies the city. Noise is tolerable."
12380,1404448,3,Two4four,04/08/2021,"The area is fine but the services are in bad shape. The water is not drinkable, you cannot fill the tank because the tap is for the sink. And the part about emptying the pot is very dirty and the tap to clean the pot comes out of the water and splashes you with the poop of other people who have used it before. A little strange everything. Before it was very good, it is neglected, a pity!"
12380,1338665,5,miguelymarta,18/07/2021,"Perfect area, we always stop when we go to sleep"
12380,1296910,5,perretmail,04/07/2021,"Nickel, services in working order, flat parking."
12380,1286365,4,ammolero,30/06/2021,Clean and well located area to visit this nice city. The noise from the bridge is evident but nothing so loud that it does not allow you to rest at night.
12380,1285348,4,CorinneLouman,29/06/2021,We found this area without thinking that it was possible to park in the city thanks to the municipality
12380,1214199,4,Remolin,23/05/2021,"Area next to the city, in a few minutes you can walk along the promenade along the Ebro river. Ideal for visiting the city and being one of the ends of the greenway from Tortosa to La Puebla de Hijar. Somewhat noisy due to traffic on the bridge over the area."
12380,1212713,4,Nikabon,23/05/2021,Good area to visit the town. Emptying and filling water. Thanks to the city council for this place for us.
12380,1203820,3,SinaH.,17/05/2021,Warning: black water disposal in the gray metal house. Was a bit difficult to see at first because it was not properly labeled / signposted. (except with a marker pen) think that some toilet paper was hanging over the grids for the gray water disposal.
12380,1182170,5,mumumimi11,30/04/2021,"Motorhome area not far from the city, with water, drainage etc. Just a little noise with the bridge. Thanks to the city."
12380,1181948,3,tobolina,29/04/2021,"Central parking space, unfortunately noisy because of the bridge"
12380,1181720,4,Rafa58,29/04/2021,"Quiet and safe place, near the town, we need more areas like this in all of Spain, the growth of AC is increasing and we have few sites .. Thank you Tortosa"
12380,1181266,3,Alice.Ramy,28/04/2021,"Area with drinking water loading and gray unloading service and free toilet. We only stopped during the day and we didn't stay for the night because there is noise from the bridge above, I don't know if we would be able to sleep. In addition, in the area there was a rather strange comings and goings of certain rather ambiguous characters. After an hour we left. I give 3 stars for the free services and cleanliness of the area, nothing to say it was clean."
12380,1166920,5,Xavesp,04/04/2021,"Very well located, next to the river, a walk to the center (by bike 2 minutes). The very large squares, there is sun and shade. The downside if you want to look for one is that it is under a bridge and you can hear the cars passing by ... for us it is not."
12380,1164702,3,pallars,03/04/2021,"15 minutes from the center, a bit noisy area due to the bridge, a shame. It fills up quickly on holidays. Possibility of parking outside if necessary."
12380,1161992,5,jonatanpardo,31/03/2021,We only stop to load water and empty. Spacious places. By day it seems calm
12380,1120162,3,oriolrue,08/12/2020,"You sleep well even on windy days, it is quite sheltered because between the reeds and the bridge you do not notice anything. the noise of the bridge does not bother, but the noise of the cars that turn to the entrance roundabout to the area. it is a very busy place."
12380,1119289,4,Suz60,04/12/2020,"White water, grey water and black water facilities. Wide parking spaces and all flat. About 2km walk to centre of Tortosa, lovely old town with Castle. Also excellent (flat) cycle paths. We recommend this site. Thank you Tortosa"
12380,1117756,3,VictorJurado,26/11/2020,"Correct place, the only downside is the noise from the bridge."
12380,1105824,4,padraigl,25/10/2020,"Came for a night and stayed 3. We liked it here as we found hiking trails in the hills. 
The noise of the busy bridge may not suit everyone but we slept very well."
12380,1104722,3,dduedra,25/10/2020,"The Area itself is fine, the only downside is the bridge that makes a lot of noise. Here we were able to empty sewage without problems, although it would be appreciated if it was illuminated so as not to have to use a flashlight."
12380,1090493,4,Netimuse,12/10/2020,"A perfect area to visit Tortosa. A 15min walk from the center and very well connected with bike lanes. In an hour and a half you visit the center and the castle and you are back in the motorhome. Clean water, gray and black. All free. We have not slept although the place seems quiet."
12380,1086418,3,trescaire,08/10/2020,Good place
12380,1071319,2,LaLola_en_ruta,26/09/2020,"Bridge noise, mosquitoes and bugs of all kinds ... two of the neighbors (they go in a camper) use the facilities to wash dishes."
12380,1039963,4,Terry6376,10/09/2020,"A basic park up with water and grey, black emptying facilities. A road bridge dominates the park up but it didn't bother me. I didn't notice much road noise. Handy place for the town."
12380,1024660,2,jamilena,04/09/2020,Lots of traffic noise over the bridge the area is below
12380,930109,4,numama58,04/08/2020,"If you do not have hearing problems, it is better not to sleep, the road overhead and very noisy, Tortosa has better places to have the area, the rest very well."
12380,877914,5,NomadasCharlatanes,18/07/2020,"We have stayed overnight and phenomenal !!! Very calm. Before leaving we have been able to empty black water, clean gray water and fill the water tank, all free, very well conditioned. There is a bridge just above and some noise is heard first thing in the morning but the night is great."
12380,796058,3,pialicer,16/03/2020,Open during the coronavirus lockdown and the reduced traffic makes the noise from the bridge bearable.
12380,786848,1,derbert,26/02/2020,"Sick place! One night was terrible, the crash of the bridge expansion let us flee at dawn. Anyone who stays here voluntarily either has hearing loss or an increased need for security."
12380,779005,3,IanM1521,11/02/2020,Good place. Very safe because busy with vans. Services Ok. Fresh water is a push button which was very slow had to hold it for ages. Other disposals Ok. The bridge is a bit noisy suggest parking away from it. But it's not too bad. Tortosa is an intresting city. The old town has not been gentrified yet. You can walk up to the Parador for a great view.
12380,778880,3,sciroco,11/02/2020,Good but just below a bridge and therefore traffic noise with a noisy connection. Still bearable.
12380,778337,3,pticlod,09/02/2020,"Parking a bit noisy for the night, but well located for visiting the city and especially its very pretty cathedral. Thank you to the municipality for receiving us for free."
12380,774227,3,glounet,30/01/2020,Thank you the town. Area close to town to visit. Services and free parking.

12380,768848,4,Steve1957,15/01/2020,"Easy to find using the co-ordinates. 8 metre bays, services easy to access. There's noise from the road but it's not too bad. Well done Tortosa."
12380,767766,5,jools13,12/01/2020,"Great place to stay, there is toilet empty, grey water drain and fresh water it's a push button but the pressure is good.
very close to town, go and visit the cathedral it is stunning.
there is some noise from the bridge but it doesn't keep you awake."
12380,765885,5,joscoco,07/01/2020,Nice free motorhome area. Thanks to the municipality. Close to the town of Tortosa. Very pretty town
12380,765566,4,merxabk,07/01/2020,Good area but like all the comments it is under a bridge that the traffic is heard enough. We have not stayed to sleep.
12380,756231,5,spookyman1,23/12/2019,"Ignore the people saying it is 25 minutes from the centre, it is a maximum of 15 minutes."
12380,755976,4,elmonodelanasa,22/12/2019,"Perfect area to spend the night. Gray and black dump service with key, but when we were there, it was open. The noise of cars passing over the bridge is annoying, at least for us, but as the night progresses, it diminishes and sleeps well. We were caught one night in the wind, with what this is supposed to be, but that's another matter .... Tarmac and reasonably flat earth. Recommended."
12380,755211,4,RojAleo,20/12/2019,"Fantastic place. Noise is not a problem. Safe area with water intake and water discharge. It is not near the center, approximately 25 minutes. But ideal for leaving motorhome."
12380,755136,4,elirol,19/12/2019,"Very noisy (road) late at night and early in the morning, calm at night. Free, easy to access, well signposted and well located. Everyone to see! (or rather to hear). Drain black and gray water, clean water and tarmac pitches. Town center 15 'walk and all shops nearby. The police pass regularly. Ideal for visiting Tortosa."
12380,754049,3,sussu,16/12/2019,"Earplugs are needed, but otherwise a perfect place for visiting this especially beautiful town."
12380,749586,5,spookyman1,03/12/2019,"Best place in the region and easy walking distance to the beautiful  Tortosa....supermarkets, bars and restaurants.

We recommend a visir to the cathedral.....stunning."

12380,747902,5,Mbwa,28/11/2019,"Very good for draining, clean nice parking. We did not stay there."
12380,746065,4,enrouelibre,23/11/2019,"Free services, paved area pretty close to the pretty city center on foot or by bike (bike path from the start). Under a road bridge so a little noisy indeed but overall very recommendable for the ""price""."
12380,735228,2,M.H.,01/11/2019,"Water was available, disposal was possible. Unfortunately too loud for the night."
12380,725829,2,ghiste,20/10/2019,"Closed water. Drain OK. Good to land, but actually the bridge is more or less noisy. Place one end of the area."
12380,709776,2,rapido776ff,01/10/2019,"Service area moderately maintained. parking area on concrete delimited. however, located under an extremely noisy highway bridge."
12380,698209,3,Josephinemarteens,20/09/2019,"Area 15 minutes from the city.  Too bad it's a bit near the bridge, but, in my personal opinion, not too much noise due to traffic.  Tarmac area with all you need for emptying and free waters.  Nice city to visit in 10 minutes on foot, just follow all along the river, which has been converted into a walk and bike path."
12380,650905,5,chloe1906,22/08/2019,Great area. Very good to visit the city and the market 1 km. We ate very good tapas in the market. Shade with the bridge. Clean area. The bridge is not noisy. We stayed there only in the morning to visit. I recommend. Thank you the city of Tortosa.
12380,628956,1,kimete,14/08/2019,"Not far from the center of the city. Bad odor, rough environment, should take care of it more. In the afternoon we were 2 motorhomes. We returned at 10pm and we were about 10. We slept without problems and the noise of the bridge is not very annoying. It is normal summer to serve it more to have open windows and skylights. We will return."
12380,622637,5,Pls56,12/08/2019,Superb area we ate out 36 degree the gendarmerie went through no comments. And again thanks for the info. Mls56
12380,613433,2,IsaduPerigord,09/08/2019,"The: large flat parking, paved with all services except electricity, quite shady. Bike path to visit the city. The -: parking very noisy because bridge above. Very dirty behind the wooden barriers delineating it with bad smells with the heat when we were there. Last kitten adopted thanks to Facebook publication of a local association that we contacted."
12380,611574,4,Horchatilla,09/08/2019,"Very good area with free services. We did night on July 31, it was hot and with the windows open you can hear even more the cars that cross the Millennium Bridge throughout the night."
12380,606976,4,carlosll,07/08/2019,"Very good site I don't put five stars because there is almost no shade, although you can get under the bridge, but it can be louder. Only 3 campers on August 6, 2019, so it may be unsafe to leave the camper alone."
12380,595585,4,slouarn,03/08/2019,Good for a stage (free services). Park at the end of the car park for less noise. Think of feeding 3 kittens behind the broken wooden bar bar. .
12380,514072,5,Jos-on-tour,13/06/2019,"Super. Free disposal, free supply. What more do you want? For toilet disposal, please just open the gray box. Fresh water from the tap next door. Many Thanks. Sleep under the bridge might be a bit loud, but it works too."
12380,492597,1,domcoco,25/05/2019,"No water, a disaster on the sector to find services"
12380,476635,4,krikri85,05/05/2019,"Here is the right address Pont del Mil·lenari 43500 Tortosa Tarragona, Spain because the other address will take you to the city center and it's a hassle otherwise the place is good to visit the city and spend a night"
12380,475744,4,ruizcamp2000,04/05/2019,"Good parking although you have to deviate a bit from the highway. It has water services and despite being under a bridge, the traffic does not bother much, although it is heard."
12380,448935,3,Lebensglück,04/04/2019,We were only here for care. Plant was clean. Thank you to the city

12380,439086,4,brigittemaurice,12/03/2019,Noisy during the day but at night it's pretty quiet. Good to spend a night and visit the city. Free...
12380,436899,3,couplefitnessfood,06/03/2019,"Very well maintained, very safe and well-lit place. Impossible to sleep with the car via C-42 at the top of the head. Very annoying ....."
12380,435239,3,javeasteve5,02/03/2019,Nice clean flat Aire with services next to overgrown river embankment where single men frequent. A lot of Road Noise and constant thump thump of the expansion joint in the road bridge directly over some of the Aire. Well lit and patrolled by local policia. Felt safe and secure with 16 other Motorhomes here.
12380,419312,2,ophiusito,02/01/2019,"The location is very bad. It has a lot of traffic noise that passes over the viaduct under which it is located. It becomes unbearable. The television signal is bad and neither had data coverage on the mobile. The cleanliness of the wastewater terminal leaves much to be desired. Good initiative of the municipality of Tortosa, but with mediocre results."
12380,418760,5,ddehem,01/01/2019,Area with all services except electricity. Spacious pitches. Too bad that some motorhomes do not respect the basic rules of knowing how to live. Washing their car with the water offered by the municipality and pollution by letting their engine run. Beautiful brand image for France.
12380,405939,3,neilson,09/11/2018,"Good service facilities, easy walk along the river to a nice town.  Plenty of historical places of interest in the town.  Lots of shops, restaurants and bars. Some areas of town seem very poor but we didn't feel unsafe.  The policia locale visited regularly. It made us feel safer. Quiet at night, road noise during the day."
12380,403943,1,JustCat,03/11/2018,We came two times and we both went ... bridge noise and breathe insecurity for the people who are in the area. Too bad because the area looks good.

12380,395056,3,burstner1,17/10/2018,Easy access. Well placed for a city walk. Services black / gray water and filling assured. Only problem: significant noise due to the overhanging bridge.
12380,391196,5,RVQ,11/10/2018,"With the coordinates that it has, it leaves us on top of the bridge. The Sygic Gps gets confused and takes us again and again to the middle of the bridge. The area is just below, but if it is nighttime it is not visible. For the rest, as many users say, the noise until 24 hours that vehicles stop passing over the bridge is annoying due to expansion joints. Then he sleeps well. Very good to visit Tortosa."
12380,375047,1,lizw58,16/09/2018,"Not the best, noisy and people seem to live here. People coming and going all night . Easy walk into town though which was nice. Water/waste needed a key several Spanish vans came to use it. but didn’t stop the night."
12380,368873,4,michbous,09/09/2018,All free services no electricity. unlike other reviews we sleep very well despite the proximity of the bridge. go to the OT book your river trip 10 € 1 hr city to visit

12380,301265,2,mektoub,26/07/2018,"To avoid to spend the night: hyper noisy. Under a bridge very passing and in a roundabout that seems to be a place of ""meetings"". A lot of cars go around in circles, park the lights on, restart, go around the roundabout, park again all night long. At 4 o'clock, the garbage collectors turn their mill for 10 minutes. I would say that it is essentially a day car park with free terminal: drain greywater and cassette, filling with clean water."
12380,297390,4,Biard,22/07/2018,"Nice area, can be a little noisy because of the road but the sites are spacious even if we are not allowed to go out table and chairs but this is the case of all the free areas in Spain. Downtown close to. Free water supply that ask for more."

12380,229992,4,chabrot,27/03/2018,"Free area 72 hours, very well placed for visiting the city with a beautiful heritage, area a bit noisy because located under a bridge but just park if possible at the end of the car park. The police go every morning."
12380,227398,3,Javiee,13/03/2018,Perfect area in terms of emptying and filling services. It is a bit noisy to be right under a bridge that is a ring belt and has enough traffic.
12380,224972,3,sweety85,27/02/2018,Free e tortosa area a little noisy with the bridge but quiet evening. Too bad that some motorhomes do not clean the toilet drain and leave their trash on the platform. Thank you all for respecting those who arrive after
12380,220954,5,debbiefletch,31/01/2018,"Excellent Aire for campervans with good facilities and close to bars, cafes and bakeries.  On via verde, so ideal for cycling in either direction.  Short walk into interesting old quarter.  We had a comfortable nights sleep here.  Don’t park under the road bridge, otherwise it will be noisy!"
12380,214620,3,nicolasd44,12/12/2017,A lot of noise and passing of trucks.
12380,214411,3,jumaolda,10/12/2017,"I fully agree with the previous comment. Except in the noise, park under the bridge, it is only for deep dreamers."
12380,213771,4,luigi20,06/12/2017,The loading and unloading of water works correctly. All very clean It is true that if you sleep very close to the bridge pollen cars pass but once caught the dream ....
12380,211085,5,paulnsheryl,14/11/2017,"Free water, grey waste, WC and waste items drop. Purpose built van park. Excellent. 40 places. Stayed 1 night with a quiet sleep. Perfect."
12380,202355,4,Coco56momo,12/10/2017,Convenient to park during the day and visit the city: 30 minutes walk from the Sant Joan. Sounds noisy for the night.
12380,173337,3,mariemarion,13/08/2017,Fully fulfilled its function for one night. The place is not idyllic but allows to spend a quiet night and visit Tortosa. Nice little town that deserves a stop.
12380,143055,3,isa65,14/06/2017,Location a little noisy but ok free service
12380,136208,5,marcosma15,20/05/2017,"Very good area, next to the river and you can empty and fill water."
12380,130042,3,rapidita,21/04/2017,Great area on the banks of the Ebro. Ideal to start the visit to the delta. Bike lane and water change services in perfect condition.
12380,122399,4,speedy136,08/03/2017,"Very nice motorhome area, everything is free, a bit noisy because of the bridge"
12380,118729,4,akiles-laki,23/01/2017,"Area with everything free and close to the town where the market. In summer to be next to the River there are mosquitoes and little shade. And during the day noise on the nearby road, although at night it calms down a lot. To be free is perfect. I have paid for worse"
12380,118561,1,wroclawdan,19/01/2017,"Good for the free service, but the noise is unbearable. Had a rather unpleasant night When you are in love with calm it is impossible."
12380,117964,4,Galle88,07/01/2017,"We have stopped to empty and see water. Site well connected, flat and with free water. Other municipalities could take an example. To sleep I do not know if it will be noisy because of the proximity of the road."
12380,117950,4,syl22,07/01/2017,"Very nice free area with service but noisy due to the proximity of the bridge with lots of traffic. Nevertheless, the night was relatively quiet and the following day we enjoyed a visit to the city located in a beautiful site."
12380,113059,3,aponz,01/11/2016,"Area with all services, wide squares and asphalted, is 2 km. from the center but it is a comfortable walk. It's a bit noisy on the road that goes by just above"
12380,112241,2,paquito,30/10/2016,"Free service area, convenient but actually quite noisy, located near a roundabout and under a bridge to each vehicle that passes on, there is a jolt. Do not park below. It must be worse. In addition, the bins are spent at 0h, good night! We will not return."
12380,111103,4,vevedol35,23/10/2016,Very nice and clean
12380,110258,4,asun,17/10/2016,"very well located area, near the city and the market"

12380,108706,4,tommy65,04/10/2016,"Isa and Thierry, spend a night in a nice area, for the noise, no discomfort"
12380,103905,3,hersat,08/09/2016,I've been resting for a while. It looks good although I don't know if you will sleep well at night with the highway passing over it.
12380,101738,5,Taczen,30/08/2016,"Excellent area, many times we make step. For the noise? question of appreciation. Local police present and some are motorhomes .."
12380,78347,4,Pitxurri,25/06/2016,"Excellent area. Clean and free services. A bit of bridge noise at night. FREE services, close to downtown, police visit often."
12380,71819,1,sphinx1978,07/05/2016,Very good to park during the day and to visit the city but much too noisy to sleep there.
12380,57078,5,leglaude66,08/10/2015,Excellent free service area. 1-2 km from the historic center.
12380,53558,4,Killem,03/09/2015,"I only did a service there. It's a nice and tidy place, the mountain is going down the road, it may disturb some sleeping conditions"
12380,52561,2,MAXOU199,27/08/2015,Pleasant location. All services. Very noisy.
12757,3274538,4,abbyms,08/09/2023,Good clean facilities. You pay €1 for a 5 minute shower and a 50c token (you get at reception) for the bathroom. Only two showers so could get busy but we had no problem. We stayed one night in a car with a roof tent and it cost €9 plus extra for facilities. There is also a laundry service on site. A peaceful quiet night for us.
12757,3264763,5,soniaabazi,06/09/2023,"Very clean campsite, clean and paid bathrooms, shower ok"
12757,3238318,5,somoslauyjavi,30/08/2023,Highly recommended area. A complete success! Quiet and very close to a supermarket. Walking to the center will be about 20 minutes. Without a doubt I would spend the night in this place again.
12757,3235719,4,Xalo1968,29/08/2023,"Very quiet and very cheap. You pay for the toilet (50 cents) but we men don't usually close the door, so you don't pay until they realize it. And showers €1. Even so, it is still very cheap. Everything very clean. And a lot of air area."
12757,3230579,4,martta6,28/08/2023,"Quiet place, near Portimao and ideal for spending the night. All services, which are paid separately, impeccable in terms of cleanliness. Supermarket very close with everything available."
12757,3222663,5,Gurutz,26/08/2023,Highly recommended. We paid 11.5€/day for a van and two people in August. Hot shower 1€ 5 minutes (a lot of time for one person... Two people can shower in that time...). Fabulous facilities. Recommended!
12757,3187510,3,himbeerwald,20/08/2023,"Everything works. price ok But very hot in midsummer because there are hardly any trees. Many trucks are parked next door, and they also start at night."
12757,3177564,4,gesui,18/08/2023,"Payment area. €11.50 1 night with water filling, toilet emptying and gray services. Withdrawal from the charming town. It does not have 5 stars because the reception is not 24 hours a day. at noon it was closed and at night too. Surveilled by supposed cameras. the barrier can be opened manually if they are not at reception."
12757,3175909,4,Ldimec,18/08/2023,"Very tidy and clean place, friendly stuff. Close to the supermarket and city center. 4 stars because of the additional cost you have to pay for the shower and toilets. I would recommend the place for the night."
12757,3139118,4,xiqui,13/08/2023,"Well located, 10 minutes from the town on foot and a supermarket next door. Little shade, only 2 showers and a place to wash dishes. Quiet and clean place. Recommended!"
12757,3138785,3,naleks66,13/08/2023,"We arrived before 5 p.m., no one at the entrance for service. We only needed drinking water and filled it up (free). We left a little after 5 p.m., an employee ran after us. , it was not our intention to leave like thieves. We will pay the 4€ without worries but indications such as the details of the services or the timetables are missing"
12757,3114375,4,rossa,10/08/2023,"Perfect, clean and tidy place to visit the area. Spacious pitches with electricity and water. Friendly and helpful staff. I don't put 5 stars, because the paid services are a bit excessive, and only one sink for washing dishes. Little shade."
12757,3084308,1,idodavid,05/08/2023,Unfortunate not being able to use showers and washing machines being paid. They charge you €4 and they only let you change the water.
12757,3080909,1,romainSophie,05/08/2023,Avoid if you have cell air conditioning because the electric meter keeps tripping (because it is not powerful enough)
12757,3068162,2,Sab1031,03/08/2023,"Quiet motorhome area to spend the night but without charm. We paid €11.50 for a pitch with electricity without having used it since all the pitches are rented at the same price (at least that's what the manager told us). Since others apparently paid less, I imagine that the price must be paid at the head… (the manager even almost made us pay €14.50). On site, all services are chargeable (WC included) except wifi (which works very badly). We were able to drain our vehicle but not fill the water since the nozzles were not suitable… I do not recommend it at all."
12757,3063485,5,ArnaudR,02/08/2023,"The price in August is 10.50 € WITH electricity, unlimited water and wifi, see the website. Showers and toilets are paid separately, so those who use the facilities of their motorhome do not have to contribute. This is the correct information."
12757,3061533,1,eloelo2109,02/08/2023,"11€ for just a van without electricity with paying shower and paying WC is abused. The staff is not friendly, honestly do not go there"
12757,3054476,5,RobinCassan,31/07/2023,"we stayed 2 nights. calm to spend the night there, you can see the storks and their nests. very close to the ""continente"" supermarket and 3 min from the lidll. very clean showers and washing machines."
12757,3039057,4,Zefirogang,29/07/2023,"We stayed here for 2 nights, everything spotlessly clean, no weeds, friendly welcome. Silves is a beautiful town to visit. We can certainly recommend this cp. We also spent a night in Tavira, the same comments apply there."
12757,3011943,5,lloydh,24/07/2023,"This is a really nice place to park. Very friendly and a short walk into town where there are plenty of really lovely restaurants. Especially if you like fish and shellfish. Amazing food and really cheap too.  There is electric, showers, washing area etc. you need euro coins for the shower and you buy tokens to use the toilet 20 cents each. So much for spending a penny eh? ;-)"
12757,3011423,5,pibanvar,24/07/2023,"Good place, near a town that is worth visiting. The toilets and showers have a separate cost, but the place is very well maintained. If we pass through the area, we would stay again."
12757,3000108,3,alexf301,22/07/2023,"Groundsman wasn’t around at all when we came. For washrooms, you needed a token which we couldn’t get bc reception was closed. Shower lights didn’t work. So many mosquitos."
12757,2999688,3,rg12,21/07/2023,"Place to spend a quiet night, but disappointed with the services knowing the Motorhome of Tavira ...."
12757,2990031,5,DiogoRicardo,19/07/2023,Good place to sleep peacefully
12757,2988463,5,josic,19/07/2023,We were very well received by a herd of goats and storks flying above our heads. Extra! Clean and quiet place. May lack a bit of shade. I highly recommend. Thank you for the welcome and the explanations in French.
12757,2982283,2,mecawyner,18/07/2023,"If you want to be eaten by mosquitoes, this is your area. To use showers and bathrooms you have to enter a token (apart from the price). €11.50 per night. It also has a stuck road, and together with mosquitoes it does not make your rest very good."
12757,2975519,2,Gorka_Fiatravel,17/07/2023,"We didn't stay the night, we tried to use the showers by paying and in a very rude manner the young receptionist told us no and that we had to pay one night to use them and there you have the prices, look at them... apart from that the area looked good."
12757,2965953,5,myfriendstan1,15/07/2023,"The company has three of these sites, we stayed on all three during our visit here. This was our third experience of them, they are all very well run, clean and good value for money."
12757,2858498,1,jacquesLassale,15/06/2023,closed for holidays!!
12757,2817742,5,imroex,04/06/2023,"It is an area with everything new. The shower 1€, the toilet 0,50€, but it is worth coming. The town ir very cool!!! You have a municipal swimming pool near. I recommend it 100€. Every night car and 2 people 9€ in June."
12757,2805175,3,38Cam,31/05/2023,"In the description it is not mentioned that the shower and the WC. are chargeable. price of the night 2 people 11,50€"
12757,2802966,4,SueWinter,30/05/2023,"Fantastic motorhome site with all the facilities, though you pay extra for toilet and shower (€.50/1). Very clean and tidy, quiet and safe. There is a large supermarket 2 minutes' walk away."
12757,2713671,3,Wesertaler,01/05/2023,"Parcels quite large and the place also clean. ""groundsman"" is only present from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. and then again from about 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. The fuse kept blowing on our pitch and unfortunately the groundskeeper wasn't there most of the time. Unfortunately, the street is also very noisy. Space is only recommended if the other SP is full."
12757,2712709,5,jbbernabe,01/05/2023,"Correct area with all services and perfect to spend the night. Calm and quiet environment. A 15-minute walk from the center of Silves, and close to shops."
12757,2700805,4,bouillette68,27/04/2023,"frankly nothing to say, very clean area, very well maintained, washing machine, hot showers, but with the heat of recent days I prefer the cold shower, which unfortunately there is not, whereas on Falaise and Tavira they are there. Close to the center, the castle and pretty little restaurants. Ideal for two or three nights maximum, after you get bored."
12757,2693214,5,ademortier,24/04/2023,"It's true close to the road, but also very close to Continente and the center is 1 km away with a host of restaurants. Storks are numerous and their nests dominate the city. There is everything on the site and I paid 34 euros for 4 nights, the fourth being free."
12757,2669247,4,Willemscampertje,14/04/2023,"Fine, place within walking distance of Silves. Toilets, showers and washing machine against payment. Gravel surface (fairly flat) and little shade. I paid 34 euros for 3 nights with electricity."
12757,2655130,4,cindyy66,09/04/2023,"The spaces are very large and leave room for taking out table/chairs. We're pretty good there. The shower is 1€ in outdoor cabins and the toilets 0.50ct per token (hence a star in the month, never seen paying toilets). You can hear the road a bit but it didn't bother us at all. 500m from a supermarket and 1km from the village. Nice to go to the restaurant in the evening."
12757,2645229,4,WanderingWeb,07/04/2023,Nice enough site near to supermarket and town where there’s some great eateries and a good outdoor space for children. Site is basic but has a good shower outside for €1 per 5 mins and laundry facilities. Views aren’t great.
12757,2617337,5,petb85,20/03/2023,hello and thank you for this very nice welcome from all the staff without forgetting Arnaud who is attentive no we spent several months it was great we will come back without problem
12757,2584889,3,brunogino,20/02/2023,"Although the site has everything the camper needs and a supermarket nearby, it still has the charm of a gravel pit! The noise from the immediately adjacent N 124 robs you of your mood during the day and sleep at night (heavy traffic)! It is amazing how little can satisfy so many people! But still better than the other SP 300 meters away!"
12757,2563886,5,Asilarem,30/01/2023,Great area with all services.
12757,2552746,4,BerndA,15/01/2023,"Everything a camper needs is there. Toi=0.5Eu, Du=1Eu, Wama=4.5Eu, Dry=3Eu, and Elect=3Eu. The WiFi does not allow streaming. The road is unfortunately quite busy and therefore not quiet. The pitches are big enough for van with trailer. Unfortunately, the place is quite full of long-term campers."
12757,2550126,5,Ciboulette28,12/01/2023,Friendly and pleasant welcome. Always smiling. Cleanliness of the site and impeccable toilets. Richard takes great care of us. Always busy removing a blade of grass or raking stones
12757,2546537,5,rpsf,08/01/2023,We have been coming since 2017 and we are happy there. The storks keep us company. The town and the shops are on foot. Richard is welcoming and helpful.
12757,2534780,3,moments2009,31/12/2022,"The pitch is very well organized and maintained. The staff is friendly, helpful and always present during the day. But: right next door is the yard of the municipal garbage disposal. Except for Sunday, the night is over at 3.45 am, then people talk loudly, the engines of the garbage trucks run for 20-30 minutes before they finally drive. The next shift arrives at 7 a.m. and everything starts all over again."
12757,2520523,3,NadavBS,12/12/2022,"Mediocre to say the best. To enter the toilets you need tokens (2 times for 1 Eu!) and once the office is closed, you cannot get tokens.. showers are also paid separately, and are open from the top & bottom, so you get cold air while you shower, and water are definitely not hot enough.. from sone reasons they also lock the laundry room after reception hours"
12757,2512427,5,Noelleblanc,04/12/2022,Good welcome very clean area lots of French toilets perfect value for money nothing to say
12757,2504749,5,Bummelsachse,24/11/2022,"Good place, shower nice and warm, disposal incl. Places big enough to put out a table and chairs. The boss, a young man, is very nice and keeps everything clean and tidy. The beaches are well worth seeing and about 15 km away."
12757,2483817,5,Basoline,05/11/2022,Very well organized camper place. Surface is gravel. Video editing. Buy tokens for the toilet before 6pm. Sanitary ultra clean. Discharge point for black and gray water very good and clean. 10 places on the road which is quiet but audible. Nice view of the hills and great place to explore Silves. We did that on foot. Continente supermarket has no parking for campers!
12757,2451563,5,Katze12345678,19/10/2022,"Very clean and well-kept place. The sanitary facilities were also more than clean. However, when we arrived (before 6pm) the reception was closed so we couldn't purchase Tolkien for the toilet which was a bit annoying. The place is open 24 hours, you just drive on it and look for a free bay."
12757,2427200,3,AnnieEmme,06/10/2022,"Good location to reach Silves (which you will visit in half a day). Normal parking, large pitches. Showers for a fee of € 1 and toilets for € 0.50. It is located near the Continente supermarket. If you decide to stay just one night, a supplement of € 1. Nothing special, but with everything you need. The reception closes at 6pm, so do everything before that time (especially buying Tokens!)."
12757,2406368,5,Schlupine68,27/09/2022,"Spacious pitches. Clean sanitary facilities, but cost extra."
12757,2397511,5,losdopi,23/09/2022,Everything perfect and new. For vehicles of any size. With everything necessary and basic in an area. Next to the town with all services.

12757,2315383,5,Beamtz,28/08/2022,"Excellent!! very basic to make a relaxing stop with shower and toilet, apart from the price, cheap."
12757,2298631,4,LauraMuAgui,25/08/2022,"We took the opportunity to see the Medieval fair of the town, the parking is close, we liked it, good experience in this place, the shower for 1 € of 5 min is wonderful! I also put two washing machines, they have their own clotheslines, good treatment by the employees, they speak Spanish."
12757,2296100,1,verliebte_aussteiger,24/08/2022,"On every pitch that works with machines, it is possible or allowed to wash your laundry and take a shower. NOT on this one. Apparently the owner or the employee does not need to earn money. Very inflexible, too bad, then we'll just go to the competition."
12757,2270564,4,sandragalvez,19/08/2022,"We arrived around 8:00 p.m., at the reception they were from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. The very friendly staff invited us to see the place. Very clean toilets, they are paid with tokens, you can get them from a machine. Shower 1 eur, we didn't use it. They have washers and dryers (it closes at 8pm) Quiet place, you can see many storks."
12757,2269424,5,MaArFa,19/08/2022,"Fantastic, like its counterpart in Tavira. Friendly and very clean. We arrived at 8 pm and found a place but it filled up quickly, I guess because of the medieval fair. Two tokens for the toilet are €1 (I recommend buying more, if there are any leftovers, they return the money) and for the shower, 1 euro"
12757,2252466,5,Basislager080711,17/08/2022,"Simply good. Nice starting point for excursions, supermarket next door, clean toilets and showers. Perfect!! We'd love to come back!!"
12757,2208649,5,SosiaB,10/08/2022,"Very good area, clean and quiet. The staff speaks French, English, Spanish (and more?) is very friendly!! You can leave the vehicle there to visit the city center which is not far away."
12757,2197147,2,veco80,08/08/2022,"2 min from the cent on foot. Well-kept and flat area with the necessary services for 10.50 euros with very little shade. Too bad that in the late afternoon the staff leave and close part of the services offered. So if you want to use the washing machine, either you do it in the hot sun or you keep them dirty. You can't even use a hammock because they get pissed off. Never seen before."
12757,2156233,5,nursevan,01/08/2022,"We have spent one night and everything is perfect, the boy is very friendly and speaks Spanish, the only thing is that to go to the toilet you need some tokens that are changed in a machine inside the reception, the boy leaves at approximately 8:00 p.m. and closes until the next day at 8:30 a.m., if you arrive later than 8:30 p.m. you will not be able to use the toilet, hot showers 1euro 5 minutes, in general very good and very quiet"
12757,2141778,1,Coveyes,29/07/2022,"The area is very good and the town of Silves is very pretty. We were alone the night of 07/17/22, we contracted electricity, but there was no electricity in the entire area from 11:00 p.m. until the next morning when an employee arrived, by the way, not friendly at all, the emergency tf was called but nobody even went They fixed nothing, we complained but they did not return the electricity supplement, for that we would have slept outside."
12757,2141221,5,TraficG,29/07/2022,"A good place to sleep, I will repeat without a doubt"

12757,2114817,4,anajuanma,24/07/2022,"It is correct, 15 minutes from the city center, a small and cozy city, you can visit it easily. The cost of the Area is €12 with electricity. Recommended"
12757,2107066,3,Irayi,22/07/2022,"A good site. But be careful when you come, since you have to pay to use the bathrooms and if you don't have the coins (they are exchanged in a machine that is inside a booth that closes at night) you can't use it."
12757,2086526,5,MarcusVetter,17/07/2022,"Small but extremely fine. A campsite with everything you need. Large pitches, very clean, tidy and quiet. Toilets and showers in top condition, even if a small amount of money is required for this. Daily cleaning of these places. The stork clatter of the many storks has a calming effect and the adjacent street doesn't bother you at all when you stay overnight. We recommend."
12757,2044035,5,Argosviajero,06/07/2022,"We have been in its three areas, perfect, very spacious, quiet, friendly employees: recommended 100X100. Unbeatable cleaning."

12757,1957904,2,ValentineMorin,08/06/2022,"This air has no charm. The road passes right next to it which makes a lot of noise even at night. The shower costs €1/5min and the toilets also €0.5, especially since they are only accessible with tokens provided by reception and reception was already closed when we arrived (6 p.m.)."
12757,1946179,5,MklMns,04/06/2022,"Good area in Silves. Very friendly staff who speak several languages, including Spanish. Optional electricity. Showers €1/5min, paid bathrooms, paid laundry."

Convenient for the showers (€ 1 = 5 minutes of hot water), convenient for the laundry (€ 4.5 washing machine, € 3 dryer). The only flaw is the exit time, which is always at 12.00 the next day, regardless of the time of arrival (for us who arrived at 18.00 it was not very comfortable)."

12757,1792818,4,JensJacob,23/03/2022,"Square, practical, good? When you start driving you think it's a mobile home dealer. Ordinary place, but without charm and right on a noisy street. What for people who like it clear and structured, even on vacation. By the way, wifi is unusable. One night okay."
12757,1761790,4,renatemarie,21/02/2022,"Was received very nicely by a gentleman in German and was able to get the last place. Unfortunately next to the road. For one night ok. It would be too loud for me for longer. 2 showers (5 minutes 0.50 euros) disposal facilities top, no toilets. Green strip in front of the popular dog toilet. The palm tree opposite is already dropping its leaves."

Silves is a very pleasant town, the surroundings of the castle are beautiful, nearby there is a bar where they sell very tasty sandwiches, the town is worth a visit."

The management need to do something about it. Also you have a other very good camper area next to the river even closer to the town
12757,1679820,5,TribalG,06/11/2021,"Very nice place with all the amenities needed. Small minus is the WiFi that doesn't work optimally ... but it's vacation, who cares. Within walking distance of supermarket and city center. Friendly and helpful at the front desk. Keep it up… great!"

12757,1312746,4,JYE19,11/07/2021,"The area is fine. Comply with what is necessary. There are not always people at the reception, correct treatment. Correct showers, little shadows. Flat and spacious squares. It is close to the town and a Continent Supermarket 200 m. There are mosquitoes like big storks, that there are, it hurts. Garbage trucks to the side, the employees at dawn screaming as if only they lived in this world."
12757,1257418,1,Dani505,15/06/2021,"We had a very bad experience. We arrived late in de evening when the reception was already closed but we knew the company from Tavira where we had a really pleasant experience. The next morning at 8 am we met the most unfriendly staff member in our two years of van-traveling. We were told, in an unkind way, that our van wasn’t a moterhome so we could stay until checkout time (12 am) and then we needed to leave. But 1 hour later she showed up next to our van and told us (in a really rude way) to immediately remove our drying towels from the fence because it was “illegal to dry your towels over the fence” in the sun. And suddenly we had to leave right away because her boss did not want a van on his property.                                       So don’t go here if you are staying in a van, there are plenty of nice alternatives with friendly staff members."

12757,1134295,3,jcgremillet,31/01/2021,"The previous comment in the form of a settling of scores confirms the atmosphere that reigns here and encourages you to look elsewhere. Certainly not 5 stars given the weakness of the sanitary and electrical equipment (6A) and the noise of the busy road which runs along the entire length of the area, but 3 stars to reward cleanliness. For one night it's good."
12757,1131712,3,jcgremillet,19/01/2021,"There is a strange atmosphere here, which perhaps explains the low occupancy rate compared to the neighboring area, which is less pleasant at first sight. Moscow's eye is hidden in the guise of a CC whose number plate is carefully hidden. It must be recognized that the place is particularly well maintained. Not a weed which probably justifies the ban on the smallest pee of your best friend caught in the act at 9 p.m. Flagrant pheasant crime the subject of a call to order the next day ...! The objective of the Moscow eye is everywhere ... except to point out the droppings of the hundreds of storks which fly over the site. So for your 4-legged friends it's by the side of the road, very busy from 6 am and all day. Calm is not here. I give 3 stars for the cleanliness and the 9 € 50 per day currently all inclusive with WIFI but without hot water."
12757,1129594,4,drlbradley,10/01/2021,Silves is well worth a visit and this little site is perfectly located. It’s about a 10 min walk to the town. Also there’s a Contininente pretty much next door! No toilets. Chargeable showers. Lovely staff as always on this little groups sites. A bit too noisy for us with lorries next door but for a short stay and for the cost it’s a good stop over
12757,1123309,3,JLYR,23/12/2020,Well placed and well equipped area. shops and town center nearby. Too bad the employee who takes care of it is rude.!

12757,1076073,2,ramlih,30/09/2020,"We were only here one night. There are around 50 parking spaces, all directly on a fairly busy street. All pitches have a power connection. There are no toilets. Showers have to be paid extra (€ 0.50) so think of coins. WLAN is free, but you have to log in again every time your mobile phone is off, it's a bit annoying. There is no hose to fill up with clean water! And as someone has already written - lots of mosquitoes! The best thing here is the super nice lady at the front desk."
12757,1035520,4,jaizba,08/09/2020,"As the other colleagues say, it is a quiet area, with large plots and services, to put a problem (for me, important) it is full of mosquitoes, that even if you smear yourself in repellent you do not scare them"

In addition, Silves is a historical city that is worth knowing. Only problem, a nearby rooster crowing at 5 am, but if you are a deep sleeper you don't know."

As well as being excellent value (€6/pn incl EHU, if staying 4 nights ) and well maintained (clean, tidy, good washing machines) the staff member who ran the site was exceptionally good.

Same has most aires people are camped there for months on end. with parking in the algarve becoming more difficult there should be a limit to the number of nights on aires, everyone then visiting the area would have chance to visit Silves. Luckily enough there was one parking spot available when we arrived we stayed 3 nights, and enjoyed our stay, if you do want to get one of the nice parking spots then arrive earlier in the year before all the French and Swedes arrive"

We were already in the Tavira that opened the gate to enter and the owner the next morning charged us without problem and even apologized for not being able to use the electricity. a shame the lack of education and understanding"
12757,759504,1,maysecilla2,29/12/2019,"We arrived at 7:00 p.m. and with the fence closed. We read the sign that said, as in Tavira, that if the reception is closed, enter, look hollow and enjoy its services. We entered after a while waiting and after a walk came a very nasty French gentleman to call our attention in very bad ways. He said that if the fence was closed, it is closed because it is complete. It is seen that they do not have to put a sign or a sign that indicates it and others have to be fortune tellers ... Very bad experience."

12758,3150969,4,LeonorVarandas,15/08/2023,"We stayed one night. The park is very clean, safe and organized. The staff was friendly. In the morning there are people selling fresh bread outside the caravans. The only advice I would give is to choose, if you have the opportunity, one of the places further back in the park. We stayed right at the entrance at the foot of the road and we heard a lot of cars in the morning and music at night. Everything else was flawless."

12758,3081673,5,NunoTira-Picos,05/08/2023,"Very good park, good cleaning conditions. Beach very close you can walk and the price is quite pleasant when compared to other parks. For those who want to take a hot shower in the spa, at the end of the day there is always a queue, but there is always the chance to take a cold shower in the street or of course in the caravan. we will repeat"
12758,3080100,5,Mila8,05/08/2023,"Area with all services available. Like a campsite but at the price of AC. Very well maintained and clean area. Very good attention from the owners, they solved the problems that arose very kindly. They have light but a three-phase plug is necessary. It is 400 m from Falesia beach, a path leaves from the AC itself. There is a small supermarket 300m away."

12758,3060275,4,blauerlandy,01/08/2023,"nice place. Proximity to the beach about 500m. A very beautiful beach. The night cost us 14 euros for 2 people and electricity. Toilets were charged extra at 0.50 euros. and showers 1 euro for 5 min. Washing machine and dryer available. The only thing that was a bit disturbing was loud music coming from somewhere, mostly until about 5 o'clock in the morning."
12758,3057742,5,DeVoogd,01/08/2023,"Great motorhome with spacious neat places within walking distance of the beach. A simple supermarket is 300m away. Camper pitches on the road are a bit noisy due to traffic, but the rest is fine. A coin is required for the toilet, shower and washing machine. Given the low price for an overnight stay, that is fine at €0.50). Number of places will be updated on the website. In high season arrive before 11:30 am."

12758,3047758,4,Sarimar2023,30/07/2023,"The pitch was extremely clean and was very well looked after and maintained by the owner. So the price was justified. Disposal worked well, a hose to fill up the water would be perfect. The location was perfect for a beach vacation. Right by the sea, only through a small forest to the beach. Unfortunately not very much shade."

12758,2939418,4,Pavons36,08/07/2023,"The place is great, €25 for 2 weekend nights, that's half that in other places for the same thing, if anything the difference is that here the 5min showers €1 is separate and little else. It has picnic areas, a shower area (""after coming from the beach""), clothes lines, it does not have a children's play area itself. I recommend the terrace at the entrance to the area, it is well priced and some grilled fish that... I will be back"

12758,2667606,5,Praothus,13/04/2023,"We were here 3 weeks. Its big but you have good Places, friendly Personal, and only 400 m to the one of the most beautiful beaches of Portugal. Falesia. A little walk to restaurants ore go opposite of the camperplace. A Portuguese family cooks for you and good. So be happy when you get a place there."
12758,2658311,4,alitosinmas,10/04/2023,"Ample parking spaces with nearby water intakes. Emptying of black and gray water nearby in the entire Area and free shower, cold, but free. Great sunsets on the adjoining beach a few meters from a forest where your pet will undoubtedly enjoy. A great place without a doubt."
12758,2657725,5,Lgodoy,10/04/2023,"We have spent Easter Week and we value very positively that: the plots are spacious, there are water intakes at different points in the area, emptying and filling within the price (€10/day without electricity) friendly staff, everything very clean and well cared for. Next to the beach, where there are many routes to do, as well as to walk the dogs. Nearby supermarkets and restaurants."
12758,2636507,5,oleebu,02/04/2023,"Very good pitch with great access to the beautiful beach of Falesia. There is a surfing school right on the beach, the waves break very well on a sandbank, even for beginners, and are great fun for those first steps. The place is great, toilets and showers extra, directly opposite a nice restaurant (looks rustic but delivers taste! Insider tip), supermarket just a few hundred meters on foot. That's why it's always fully booked, you have to be lucky if you drive to this place!"
12758,2633827,2,Minorca58,01/04/2023,"We arrived around 12 very bad reception, the manager very rude... could we have had a French and/or German license plate perhaps ????"

12758,2628192,5,AnjasReisen,28/03/2023,"Large gravel places on a really civilized place. Peace and order are respected. Directly behind the square there is a dreamlike natural area with pine trees and flowers, which leads in a few minutes to Praia Falesia, one of the most beautiful beaches in the Algarve. In addition, very neat and modern sanitary facilities (50 cents per toilet), 1 € for 5 minutes shower (hot). Any time!"
12758,2625856,5,Benkler,26/03/2023,"A really nice place in close proximity to a beautiful beach. The area is very well maintained. The information given here is ok. You can really recommend it, especially if you want to spend days at the beach."
12758,2608754,4,Pascaline56,13/03/2023,"Very clean, very decent pitch size. Near the sea."
12758,2595768,5,Birgit294,02/03/2023,A pitch not far from the sea. A bakery and a supermarket are also nearby. Aldi and Lidl about 10 km. The place itself is very clean and gravel and the paths are also easily passable with a mobile home. I paid €66.50 for seven nights without electricity. With electricity I heard 12 euros per day.
12758,2587429,1,Braut777,22/02/2023,"Wanted to use this space - but everything was occupied. Since it was early in the morning, I politely asked if there were any departures and if we could wait outside. He said very briskly and rudely that he has no space and we should leave the premises immediately! He then signaled that I should drive off and buckle up outside. Never go there again..."
12758,2567560,1,tehonu,03/02/2023,Luckily it was full with queue outside. Too many people for too little space between each vehicle: literally on top of each other. We continued our way dreaming of our beautiful addresses on the Atlantic coast towards Lisbon.

12758,2531316,1,zucche,28/12/2022,"I would have liked to have stayed because it looked like a nice place and had good reviews but the guy at the front desk was the most arrogant person we've ever encountered. Knowing that it was full, all I had to do was empty the gray and black water, but it wasn't possible because that person was rude..."

12758,2510484,5,MrsVanny,01/12/2022,"What a super cool motorhome, close to a beautiful beach, beautiful coast. You can make wonderful hikes from the camper place. Relaxed atmosphere despite large motorhome, wonderfully quiet. Everything clean and fresh. Highly recommended!"
12758,2505886,4,bushilde,26/11/2022,Totally beautiful because it is so close to the sea and the beach is so beautiful. It feels (unfortunately) a bit like being in an allotment garden. We got in trouble because our children didn't walk on the given paths.
12758,2495009,5,ketty71,14/11/2022,great place..clean....staff very friendly and attentive..sea next door...top services...nothing to complain about like Silves and Tavira....very well kept everywhere...well done... .we appreciate the 3 parks...places to recommend....perfect....thank you...
12758,2488577,1,Lunatica66,09/11/2022,"It will be very perfect as the comments say, but good luck getting a place, we have tried several times and nothing. As a recommendation they send you to other places, having another area right next to it where we were lucky, at this time super full everything incredible."
12758,2484916,5,MartinKoglin,06/11/2022,A truly perfect pitch in the beautiful Algarve. About 400 meters to the beach. Very nice and helpful employee. Many overwinterers and therefore very difficult to get a place. The pitches are big enough and the disposal of gray and black water is generous. Restaurants and supermarket nearby
12758,2474186,4,rocinante,31/10/2022,"Magnificent place, without a doubt it is to repeat. good reception and very friendly staff. It is usually full but this is supply and demand... who does not like road and blanket. installation very correct, new and complete."
12758,2473490,5,kalorieboembeli,31/10/2022,"great place! super nice and helpful employee! sanitary facilities well maintained. for a shower it takes 1 euro/5 minutes, for the toilet you need a token. therefore perfectly clean. 10 min walk to the gorgeous beach. 2 smaller supermarkets within walking distance. very quiet at night, can definitely recommend the place!"

12758,2442982,1,rico11,14/10/2022,"A right of reply, please, Didi686, firstly, I didn't insult anyone, I don't know this word, you are trying to disparage me for a true comment, secondly, my wife!! you are next to the plate, I travel alone, sorry to disappoint you."
12758,2442207,4,sprinter216,14/10/2022,"The location of the site is ok. Unfortunately, the staff is not nearly as ok. I was given to understand that I would not be able to get onto the site with my converted camper despite free spaces. They just want wisdom here. Too bad."
12758,2441517,5,Provon,13/10/2022,The best thing about this place is the restaurant across the street! Amazing homemade Portuguese food! Try the grilled chicken! The site is super nice. Close to a beautiful beautiful beach and everything is working perfectly on the site.
12758,2437327,4,miandefrana,11/10/2022,"The area is very nice. Particularly, I prefer that all the services be included in the global cost of the area. On the other hand, it is a nuisance that reservations cannot be made via the web. They should improve these details. Otherwise great. The beach is luxurious."
12758,2433700,5,Didi686,09/10/2022,"rico11, yes the area and the staff are very good and always ready to help and it's also thanks to the boss. He made a justified and polite remark to you, you and your wife did not accept him and became aggressive. Too bad you use this site to insult people."
12758,2431849,2,Campingfridolin,08/10/2022,"Unfortunately, there was no more space for camping. Although the showers have to be paid for one way or another, we were not allowed to use them for a short time... What a pity!"
12758,2421426,4,bubuvantana,03/10/2022,"We stayed here for 2 nights with our Sprinter. €9.50 per night for 2 people without electricity. In itself a great place, everything is perfectly clean. We also used the washing machine for €4.50/dryer for €3. The only thing that made the 4 stars was that the shower cost 1€ and the toilet 50 cents. However, one has to say that it is still acceptable for the cheap parking space price."
12758,2408739,1,miguelgarcia,28/09/2022,"The operator treated us very badly. He told us that there was no other campsite within 40 km. Right next door there was another one with enough space and the gentleman, very kind and cheaper. Large plots, electricity, water, services. All perfect for the night"
12758,2403558,5,ddgomes,25/09/2022,"Excelent place for a stay, being one or several days. Every time I can I came here. Recomend it for sure"
12758,2403338,5,arcipowska,25/09/2022,"it is a nice place, with access to the most beautiful beach ever!"
12758,2397336,3,ketxa,23/09/2022,"Fairly modern area, flat pitches and fairly clean. The beach very close, but 800m not 400m as advertised. In the end we only stayed one day, since the awning, the solar panel and the rest of the van were put on like a Christ by the resin of the pine trees."
12758,2384952,5,BigErnie2019,19/09/2022,"We are thrilled, beautiful location, great space, spacious, clean, nice staff, friendly and helpful. We were lucky, someone just left (10:00), really fully booked. €12 per night including electricity, have also extended, wifi slow but free. We can recommend the grill opposite. PS: To the dog owners - please on the leash and also remove the heaps!!!"
12758,2382565,5,Archelon5,18/09/2022,"Here we are. The description corresponds to the services offered. Indeed, it is better to see the free places on their site and arrive in the morning, but places available every day. Beach, pine forest and magnificent cliffs. No dog issues."
12758,2373938,5,terrim,15/09/2022,"An excellent stopover for short or long duration. Standards are still very high not having deteriorated since the pre covid era. Pitches are well spaced & well demarcated and electric points include water taps. The guys that manage the site are very polite, pleasant and multi lingual & extremely diligent- they even rake the gravel on the pitches that are vacated. Arrive before lunch."
12758,2371214,5,MaAnMaFi,14/09/2022,"Very nice and clean place. Cold shower free, warm shower 1€. Toilets cost €0.50. Pitch is connected to a beach about 5min walk away and beautiful! We would come again! :-)"
12758,2371141,4,benjafrancia,14/09/2022,Ideal to spend a few days and enjoy the beach that is next door. You can camp. The bathrooms and showers are paid and there are few for the volume of motorhomes there are.
12758,2365357,2,hasenteufel,12/09/2022,"We didn't like the place from the audience because it was too loud and people who use this place to spend the summer and winter. From my point of view, nobody should be allowed to stay there longer than 1 week. 23 mobile homes had to stay overnight in front of the door to get a place the next day. Toilet and shower has to be paid extra."
12758,2357355,4,charlitos,10/09/2022,"Clean, and next to the Falesia beach, €13 with electricity for two people, supermarket 2 minutes away, everything very tidy, to sleep and take a bath is great"
12758,2346717,4,Miguelbg,06/09/2022,14 euros with electricity and wifi 4 people. The toilets and showers are paid. Good nearby beach with a very pleasant walk. Covirán supermarket 200 meters.
12758,2335753,3,pereira47,03/09/2022,"I have been visiting this area since the beginning, but at the moment there is a lot of lack of respect from users towards each other they invade the adjacent plots when the dogs are going to pass they do their needs sometimes in the plots of other users it is certain that the owners they pick up the solids but the liquids stay and with that the smell remains at the moment there are many motorhomes that don't know if"
12758,2332645,5,LammyA,02/09/2022,"We went there spontaneously and were allowed to choose the place. Some shade from the trees. Spontaneously extended. The beach right around the corner, incredibly beautiful. Shower Warm to lukewarm. Nice staff, very helpful with questions. Price €12.50 per night with electricity and good internet service for the mobile home. We were very satisfied and would come again."
12758,2330143,1,mymontauk,01/09/2022,"I arrived today around 18:00 and it was full, the guy who attended me told me that it was full and gave me an option of the Tavira area 40' from this area, he did not mention that 100 mtr, there was another area."
12758,2328167,3,LimaFox,01/09/2022,"Well maintained area, large pitches although we have chosen a smaller one to stay away from the road. 10 euros per van and 2 people. Free cold shower, hot shower 1 euro 5 minutes. Toilet 50 cents for each use. Check out for us was at noon, and at 11.15 the manager came to remind us that we had to be out by that time. Very convenient in praia da crag."
12758,2327243,5,kundenfix,01/09/2022,"The owners have conjured up a beautiful place. Here the wet cells in the WoMo can be checked for their suitability. But there are also coin toilets and ""free"" shower areas. Three disposals for the WoMo's round off the extremely cheap offer. The wonderful beach can be reached via a staircase. Conclusion - 5 stars plus!"
12758,2316788,5,CarolaFlohr,29/08/2022,"Uncomplicated check-in and free choice of seats. Approx. 500m walk to the beach, which is very crowded in summer. The site has some tall pine trees providing shade, overall very clean and quiet. Shower costs €1 for 5 minutes. Toilet 50ct. Great place for motorhomes."
12758,2312818,5,Landa19,28/08/2022,"Awesome area. Fantastically cared for. Totally recommended, yes, it is almost always full (it must be for a reason)"
12758,2297539,2,colmass88,25/08/2022,"Overvalued area, we spent a night on the road waiting to enter, paying to park outside, the road to the beach with a lot of sand for children's carts and up to 400m stairs, crowded beach, showers, you have no possibility of regulating hot water, you pay 1 euro and whatever it comes out, wifi with many cuts, large plots with electricity and water, I will not return again"
12758,2190730,5,matthieuablin,07/08/2022,"Remember to come very early! Arrival at 7am to have a place available at 10:15am. Sometimes, a few days of waiting possible in front of the area depending on departures. Definitely worth the wait. Very clean and maintained area daily, machines and dryers on site, possibility to go to the toilets for 50 cents and to take a 5-minute shower (5 real minutes!) at 1 euro (only negative point: water rather lukewarm than hot). Possibility to take a cold shower outside for free. 12.50 euros per day (3 people, 1 vehicle, 1 dog, wifi and services included). Unbeatable prices! People at the reception very pleasant and who speak French. Beach accessible very easily on foot and which is magnificent! Do not hesitate to go there at nightfall to see the illuminated footbridge. Small grocery store and a few restaurants nearby. We will return."
12758,2165491,5,AndiGebauer,03/08/2022,We spent two nights on this beautifully situated pitch (2 people/1 van). Beautiful path to the beach. The site fees are very moderate and we have had good experiences with the groundskeeper. Unconditional recommendation.
12758,2154046,4,Markmetznbus,31/07/2022,"A true Motorhome camping! I was actually well surprised how nice the set up was. Large spaces, nice parking bays, partly under the trees, paths lighted at night, calm and less the 500m to the beach directly from the campsite. We stayed for just one night but could be easily more. Make sure to arrive early at the day as it is a popular site to go to. and just for 11,50 per night!"

12758,2133911,4,juankygh,28/07/2022,"I don't give it 5 stars because it doesn't have a town nearby... but the area is great, spacious squares and 5 minutes from the beach through a pine forest that is lit up at night... I'll be back"
12758,2124832,5,LAXIENA,26/07/2022,"We arrived here to stay 2 nights and in the end we stayed 5. We use this Area as a base to get around and get to know other places and beaches, including Zoomarine, which is spectacular. The staff and facilities are 10. You have to arrive early to find a place, otherwise you have to wait the next day in some small places in front of the Area. Highly recommended."
12758,2112183,4,NikoBerrocal,23/07/2022,"Area located near Falesia beach (10 minutes walk), with shade, electricity and water connection. He charges €1 for the shower. With €2 I showered well with my two children. For two nights 4 people, a dog and the motorhome €24. For us very well. We were comfortable. With awning and tables removed. Large enough plots. When we left there was a queue to get in..."
12758,2072884,5,NuggetKatie,14/07/2022,"Inexpensive, beautiful parking space with toilets (50 cents) and showers (cold free, warm 1 €). Little shade, large pitches, all with electricity. Friendly staff. Water/grey water free. Short way to the beach, but very narrow in the high season and at high tide! July €11.50 per night, August €12.50 per night. Tensioning the awnings in the ground very difficult."
12758,2067583,5,onthegowithflow,13/07/2022,"This place definitely deserved 5 stars. There is nothing bad to say about this. Super maintained, super friendly staff, close to a beautiful beach and cheap! The staff goes out of their way to keep everything neat and organized. Even the pine needles are raked together! You pay for toilet and shower separately, but the cold outdoor shower is free."
12758,2061356,5,christophevirginie,11/07/2022,"Clean, square the staff cleans (impeccable showers) and rakes all the time. Kudos to the brave. Good and large pitches. beaches, cliffs nearby. Lack of clotheslines that's all. We will return."

You can walk to a super beautiful beach and Vilamoura is a nice place that is easily accessible by bike from here. Of course also near Albufeira, but we have not been here this time."

12758,2032104,3,letsdriiive,03/07/2022,"Nice big park with all the facilities. For the size of the park it should have more service areas, specially to empty toilet (there’s only one) Toilets and showers paid. Access to the beach is a plus definitely (ard 600) Note that path ends with lots of steps down to the beach which may be a problem for people with mobility issues."
12758,2023716,5,JaniaMyt,30/06/2022,"Excellent place! Quiet night, almost on the beach, friendly staff, spotless showers and toilets. We paid 14 euros and had unlimited water and power. The best camp with travel services."

12758,2014062,4,levelo,26/06/2022,In terms of cleanliness and order 1a pitch. The direct access to the beach is of course another plus point. The only thing that doesn't really appeal to me is the ambience (quite sterile).

Little shade on the pitch (36 pitches in the shade) large couple cells, shower and toilet cost extra, outdoor showers are free and really great. The beach is super nice and easily accessible :) At the front of the street it is unfortunately relatively loud and a lot of traffic even at night. staff friendly."
12758,1962331,5,SaudaySergio,09/06/2022,"Great area! Clean, well defined and with all services. It is very careful. The only but is that the showers are paid (€ 1) and the water, sometimes, does not come out as hot as you would like. For the rest very well and with direct access to the beach."
12758,1961120,5,Lukaseli,09/06/2022,"A very nice clean place, the plots are large. Everything is there, water is available at most electricity columns.

12758,1926452,3,danyribi,29/05/2022,"Unfortunately, as with the square next to it, no opening hours are published (neither here nor on the homepage), so that at 9 p.m. we stood in front of the closed barriers and had to continue. At the front desk there was no information as to whether and how late check-in could be done - no number was found on site either. Nevertheless, the place made a good impression at first glance"
12758,1923544,5,SarahChrisW,28/05/2022,"Park with large pitches and direct access to the beautiful beach (400m). Good price (€11.50 including electricity), but the toilet and shower cost extra. Friendly staff."
12758,1917281,5,chachaaure,26/05/2022,"Superb place! A stone's throw from the beach, quiet and with large pitches, what more could you ask for. We paid 12 euros per night for two people, a CC, a dog and with electricity. Super well placed, opposite a small restaurant. Note that access to the showers and toilets is chargeable and the wifi works great!"
12758,1900705,5,Frida23.5.2020,19/05/2022,A nice place with spacious pitches.

But for €9 you are in a top place in the Algarve. Dirty and clean water facilities are included. We were pleasantly surprised. Staff was just friendly to us."
12758,1883101,4,col32,11/05/2022,"Very clean and well maintained with great facilities and big plots. €11 per night, inc electric. Thanks Located right next to a stunning beach. Steps up and down to access beach might  be a problem for some. 1 star deducted because of the incredibly rude and impatient staff. Just ignore them and enjoy your stay."
12758,1880870,4,marion.zuko,10/05/2022,"very nice air, 9 euros drain and water, 11 euros with electricity, you have to go down a lot of stairs to access the beach, not easy for everyone, the tenant speaks perfect French, you need a means of transport for shopping, we are there stayed 2 nights."

12758,1857808,1,Klatschmohnwies,28/04/2022,"you pay for the comfort that every free parking lot offers. the toilets cost an additional fee per visit and are a container as you know it from festivals! Gravel site and staff, who hang around in front of the toilets and showers and watch the campers going in and out there. In general, the tone is very unfriendly. Brushing your teeth is forbidden in the sanitary area!"
12758,1843848,5,boby83,21/04/2022,"Very nice place, with all the services. Very welcoming and friendly staff, beautiful beach 400m away, shops nearby. Arrive early as it is often full."

12758,1812278,5,Chris_L,09/04/2022,"Fabulous location. Where else could you stay on the Algarve for such little money and in such beautiful surroundings and so close to the beach? The site manager is perhaps less friendly than the people who work at the 2 other related sites in Tavira and Silves, who were always friendly and smiling and happy to help."

12758,1777447,1,TinaWrighty,08/03/2022,"Place looked good but was full. And that was communicated to you in such an unfriendly way. So if you liked an unfriendly rebuff, you should try it here."

12758,1750083,5,cloudman42,07/02/2022,Got here early at 9.00am as recommended and was number 3 waiting for a place. this commercial aire is just about perfect. the pitches have plenty of space. the staff are super helpful and friendly. it has 3 drive over gray water dump drains. the beach is beautiful  and there is a bar and supermarket within easy reach. The only down side is it has no toilets.
12758,1742486,5,Galeonparking,28/01/2022,"For me it is the best area in the Algarve, large squares, large showers, among pine trees, the path to the beach is very pleasant, the beach is a great beach! Supermarkets nearby, restaurants seem to be too, but closed in winter."
12758,1715592,4,Prec429,25/12/2021,"A very beautiful place, but when we arrived there was only one parking space. Cipriano was very cordial and told us that we would only have a space in the motorhome without electricity. It doesn't have bathrooms, you have to use the one in the car. From the park, it's a 10-minute walk to Falesia Beach, which is incredibly beautiful! We pay €9.50 for the night, €4.50 for laundry and €3.00 for drying."
12758,1715418,5,Ericboele,25/12/2021,"Simply perfect, if all motorhome pitches could be like this! No further explanation necessary. Even got a gift for Christmas"

12758,1707334,3,dieffe,10/12/2021,"Anyone who comes here should know that the owner understands little or nothing about courtesy, respect for his customers and the idea of service. The way he treats his guests is characterized by arrogance, disrespect and arrogance. I just enjoy the great beach and the friendly camper neighbors ... and avoid contact with the forever bad-tempered owner."
12758,1705672,2,TorbenMeyer,07/12/2021,"First greeting: ""ALL FULL"". After telling the owner that we just wanted to fill up with fresh water, he replied that it was € 4. Then I asked nicely if I could take a shower here with my 1.5 year old daughter because it is always a bit cramped in the van, but that would definitely not work…. Friendly is different"
12758,1696497,5,Wolle2,23/11/2021,"Very nice parking space. We stayed here two years ago and loved it. The electricity network has been expanded (now every plot has electricity), four new spacious showers have been installed with hot water and two showers with only cold (summer) water. We will spend 8 weeks here. Our thanks to this operator for the beautiful facility. We keep coming back."
12758,1696412,5,Twin600SLT,23/11/2021,I give five stars for this extraordinary place. It is very well looked after by Mario and the entire team. I am already in the fourth year until March on this place with my dog. All employees are very friendly and helpful groundskeepers. At Christmas there are stollen and at the turn of the year mulled wine for all campers.
12758,1694272,4,Ladde,20/11/2021,"Very clean pitch with all services and even WiFi on the whole site, but you need luck to get a pitch as there are many permanent campers."
12758,1692235,5,josemin55,18/11/2021,"Great campsite! Lots of space for motorhomes, a very friendly welcome and always attentive to any problem. Magnificent beach 5 minutes away. I recommend."

12758,1683991,5,Mssmaris,10/11/2021,We didn’t stay here because it was full. The receptionist told us you need to arrive before 09:00 in the morning to maybe get a spot
12758,1683529,5,mfb52.,09/11/2021,"We are there at the moment, very nice area, but come early, because often full, thank you to the managers for finding us a place, this area is really nice and well placed, we recommend"

12758,1643440,3,Marinehrl,14/10/2021,My rating is not representative because I couldn't go. The campsite was really full. His neighbor too!
12758,1637601,5,Parknight8312,10/10/2021,"Excellent spot, great organization on the area, the pitches are large, all the services available on site. Magnificent beach 500 m away on foot, with direct access. The only downside is the lack of WC. I recommend without reservation"
12758,1633476,5,JanVidarDahle,08/10/2021,"Beautiful place, with a beautiful path down to the spectacular Falésia beach. Nice atmosphere, good service, ironed facilities, clean and tidy, - and peaceful at night."

12758,1617487,5,esojcamper,29/09/2021,"I finally managed to get a space to enjoy this service area, which seems to be considered one of the best, so note the comments. And it is, in fact, always crowded, because a good part of the motorhome drivers spend a lot of time here. But first thing in the morning, you always get a seat. And it's well worth it, as in addition to the undeniable quality of the space and services, the secret seems to be strict maintenance, as everything looks new, newly opened. If you are lucky enough to get a spot, take advantage because there is no other area like it and with the beach right there and what a beach!"
12758,1614633,5,apeos,28/09/2021,Excellent area is the 2 time we go

12758,1595946,2,Sujai,20/09/2021,"They offered us a pitch for 2 AC since we were going together and in return they would charge us for a single day of each AC of the two days we were going to be. When we went to pay the second day, they told us first that they had not told us that and then that We had not understood them, and that we had to pay the full day for 2 AC with a reduction of € 1. They saved a plot and charged us double. They have no word."
12758,1595457,5,PGenez,20/09/2021,"10 € electricity and wifi included, from the square of trees and the beach very close. ideal despite our hasty departure .... a big thank you to the receptionist for his availability to find us an ambulance. I could not do it verbally for lack of such contact."

Ah, I will be back...."
12758,1580606,5,Popppotz,15/09/2021,"Very nice and well-kept place. The direct access to the beach (about 5 minutes through the dune / pine forest) moved us to stay another night. Price-performance-top! (Pure information and no rating: there are no toilets !, shower 1 €, free WiFi)"
12758,1579225,4,sey,15/09/2021,"Area with large squares, although little shade. They treated us very kindly. The only downside to the plot neighbors who seem to be alone in the area."

12758,1554668,5,VitorAfonso,07/09/2021,"I've been to this park twice already, and had the pleasure of meeting and talking to the owner a few times, and, in my humble opinion, I believe this park is at the highest level in its category, so I definitely recommend it. , and it is hard for me to read some comments, which may originate from poorly educated people with a lack of education. Soon I will return to Arnaud."
12758,1553920,5,OceanaCamper,06/09/2021,Great place with very friendly hosts. All is there and the wonderful beach is a few paces away. A little Coviran and some restaurants at the other side of the road..
12758,1548978,0,ArnaudR,05/09/2021,"MarcBesnard,after leaving the aire,you parked your camper on the other side of the road in front of our entrance and installed your table and chairs on the public space. The way you behave is the reason why so many restrictions are decided by the authorities against motorhomes.The fact that you stayed in our park doen't allow you the next day to camp along the public road in front of our door."
12758,1546891,5,gegemarie,04/09/2021,As often better to arrive in the morning spotless clean calm friendly employees
12758,1539108,1,marcbesnard,02/09/2021,"I was about to give 5 stars to this camp.

5 starts to the camp and the nice team, helpful and really friendly. The camp is super clean, there is enough space for any van, camping-car and the services are good for this low price.

0 stars to the owner of the camp who was impolite with us just after we leaved. He treats us without respect and not like a client. So sad to finish this journey in the camp with such a bad experience. We won’t come back."
12758,1537995,5,danimarta,01/09/2021,Very spacious places ... 10 x 8 approx. quiet place without noise at night. bakery service on request at reception. Coin operated washer and dryer area. Coin operated hot water showers. Nearby there is a supermarket. The beach very close by walk from the area. It is the 2nd time we go and we will return without a doubt. Next to it is another area here.
12758,1529922,4,MarcusVinhas,30/08/2021,"The place is extremely well located, organized, safe, clean and has a good price.  I had an excellent stay.

The negative points refer to the staff, due to the lack of friendliness and helpfulness of the employees.

 I will certainly repeat it, hoping to find better prepared employees in the future."
12758,1523822,5,carolina34567,28/08/2021,"We only use hot water for shower, it was €1 per person. Admission was €3 but it was very full, it looked like a great park!"

12758,1456530,5,KlaraGuiomar,14/08/2021,"The area is very good and in high demand, if you arrive in the afternoon you may not find a place on these dates. Indeed there is no WC, but because it is very focused on AC (we went with a camper). The location is great for walking to the beach and even for the restaurant area."
12758,1426369,5,christiancastro,09/08/2021,"Great place, but now always fully booked in August, we were lucky enough to get a place in the parking lot. It was definitely not the last time."

12758,1312636,5,Terry319,10/07/2021,"The site is lovely location is perfect for the beach, supermarkets and nice restaurants all within walking distance. My only gripe is the lack of respect and the noise levels from other people, we have been here for 9 nights and every night we have had Motorhomes arrive after midnight setting up to grab a free night and then packing up first thing in the morning. This practice should be stopped by the park owners"
12758,1285448,4,PaulaOR,29/06/2021,"Very well kept site, close to a beautiful beach, large pitches. As against: pay showers and no toilets. Still very calm and pleasant atmosphere. Price of motorhome with two people and electricity, with check out at 6pm: € 16"
12758,1282244,1,Friedhelm2017,27/06/2021,"A simple gravel place without toilets and trash cans. For this, the operator sells chemical toilet additive from the sea container. Interesting environmental concept. The place smells like a big chemical toilet. I don't want to support that. There is only cold water for washing up and a ""garden shower"" on the entire site. The beach is ok but lots of seaweed and overcrowded. There are nicer places ..."

12758,1271767,5,AmanGarRod,23/06/2021,"We found it by chance, it is very well signposted on the road, we liked it and we are going to stay longer than expected. It is quite large (about 120 pitches) and spacious, quiet, peaceful. It has showers, but no toilets, they let you know before paying. Direct access to the beach. They let you choose a plot before entering, we look for the shade of the trees so we choose one without electricity"
12758,1270668,3,jerovega7,22/06/2021,"Three days and very well, only one drawback does not make the barrier at night, so that anyone can enter at any time they want, waking up the people who are resting."
12758,1259355,3,baladeur74,16/06/2021,"Price 11 euros the first night, 10 if you stay several nights. Beautiful motorhomes ... it feels like a nearby Beach expo show so many people. it's clean but my cat didn't like it. The guard comes to rake the gravel when you leave the site ... I'm off to the Costa Vicentina."

12758,1252650,3,nofrills,13/06/2021,"The place is in a good location. ATTENTION: no toilets! So it is not suitable for vehicles without a toilet, we saw people who turned into a corner on the square. at 11 o'clock the owner came and asked if we were leaving today (departure is allowed until 12 o'clock), we said that we wanted to extend. He was not very friendly and still had enough space for people arriving…."

12758,1150818,5,BBNK,13/03/2021,"Magic place. Great guys at reception: Ciprian, Lorentino, Marius, Richard! Perfect to stay as long as posible!! The beach is one of the most beautiful in Europe. Everything is very clean and organized. Electricity and water right on parking spot. Big respect for mr. Arnaud. He did a fantastic place in this heaven area."
12758,1145437,5,henjac,02/03/2021,"Very well maintained area, very friendly welcome, marked out pitches on clean gravel. quiet for this price it's worth a campsite."
12758,1136605,5,pascalfa,11/02/2021,Everything has been said and in addition we have the impression of not being in Portugal. .. No barking dogs! The calm in addition to the quality of the services.
12758,1133570,5,Waswaswas,28/01/2021,The place is very well maintained and the pitches are large enough to keep a distance. Everything you need is there and the internet works well. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The surrounding area is ideal for relaxing and hiking.
12758,1133306,4,tdm73,27/01/2021,"Direct access to the superb cliff beach, and paths for a walk. Well laid out area under large trees. Services Ok. But too many people, all the places are full, and I did not like the atmosphere of this retirement camp. Empregados simpaticos, mas aqui nao é Portugal."
12758,1131664,4,joscroixrousse,19/01/2021,Very nice beach nearby
12758,1127783,5,RuiVal,03/01/2021,Very good and friendly people. Only in summer is it difficult to get a place.
12758,1126184,5,Dede994,31/12/2020,"We come back every year and are welcomed every time. We don't understand cranky people want 5 star service but pay peanuts. The places are large, the beach is next door, there are showers, washing machines, dryers, wifi etc. What more ?"
12758,1126179,5,Kadis,31/12/2020,"Very nice aire, fantastic location close to Falesia beach. Very clean and helpful staff. we will be back."
12758,1126158,1,Didj,31/12/2020,"Hello everyone, you have to explain to me how you can give 5 stars to a soulless ""gas factory"", piled up against each other at an exorbitant price of 9.50 euros for a night without electricity ...? Would the campincarist have lost his adventurous soul in favor of these places for ""sores"" ..........?"
12758,1119308,5,nico30,04/12/2020,Park very well located near the beach with a good price for the services it offers. The hot water showers are only € 1 and are very clean. Employees are always willing and ready to help. I recommend and intend to return.
12758,1119282,5,jackwilliams,04/12/2020,It's a very quiet place next to the beach with kind people. The staff is respectful and helpful. The prices are really good for what they offer.It was supposed to stay just a couple of days and we stayed a whole month. I would seriously recommend it and I will come back. Usually I don't give reviews but this park deserves it.
12758,1119265,5,Silvadb,04/12/2020,"Very successful, the place is very beautiful, very reasonable price 10 € with electricity. Shower € 1"
12758,1119226,2,JohnBianca,04/12/2020,"Friendly welcome by a Dutch gentleman, but later on the spot we were more or less barked at by a Portuguese that we had to pay, treated really rude a total lack of empathy. He also gave an internet code that didn't work. Not our campsite, but nice and close to the beach and excellent facilities. Left after 1 day never to come back."
12758,1114997,5,sunnybird,13/11/2020,"It is a nice CP for us. We have enough space and are going to spend the holidays here. The climate is partly to blame for this and the measures regarding COVID-19 are also being tightened up. The CP is fully occupied every day and therefore we always find it a pleasant place here, where we are never short of a chat."
12758,1114853,1,Naturbursche_x,13/11/2020,"We were there a week ago. 9.50 euros for two person camper 2 euros for a lukewarm shower. The shower rooms were not clean. There is only one garbage can space at the entrance. The next day we were rudely asked when we would finally go because the parking space was full. 12:30 was our arrival, we had to vacate the place by 12 noon - no full 24 hours!"
12758,1114205,1,pathern,10/11/2020,"I do not think that the owner of this area is listening, because came at the end of the afternoon he did not allow us to park normally he was eating, I do not recommend this location .... because too many people too."
12758,1114061,5,LilietRoger,10/11/2020,"We went there just to drain and take water, very welcome and very clean. All for € 3."
12758,1111071,4,TEJ90,01/11/2020,"Stay in October 2020: Only wanted to stay one night as there was no toilet (self-assembly / van), but stayed 12 nights! Nice, clean and quiet place with very nice relaxed guests (mostly retirees). For 10 € the night including storm and almost beach location simply unbeatable. Cold shower for free, warm 1 € / ~ 5min. One star deduction due to missing toilet."
12758,1109396,3,motiv1410,30/10/2020,"As a parking space for one night, that's okay. But showers cost 1 € for about 3 minutes and there are no toilets at all, but a clear point deduction."
12758,1106617,4,jacaldo,26/10/2020,"Early October  
Very tidy site with a short walk to wonderful beaches.
Would have been happier if the manager had a smile on his face, I               tripped the electricity 4amps, the boxes are locked so had to get it reset, my fault I was obviously thick if the managers face was anything to go on, maybe he was having a bad day.
Other than that not a bad place to stop for a few nights."
12758,1100880,2,newvit,21/10/2020,"A nightmare washing laundry and drying it I lost 5 hours 4 washing machines and a single dryer, you can imagine how much time wasted waiting. the reception / laundry hours are not indicated: at 5 pm it was already closed. Clean area but no toilet !!!!!!!!"
12758,1097998,5,Photosbydanvin,18/10/2020,"Highly recommended ... space, groundskeeper, facilities, price ... 5 stars"
12758,1095845,2,jeritous,17/10/2020,"Despite being a well-equipped area, and good seats. The manager was an edge. Just as the area is overcrowded with fixed ACS"
12758,1089407,4,charollais,11/10/2020,"Very clean air, ideal for spending several days by the ocean, staff a little cold at first, but they are very available and helpful"
12758,1089267,5,Ahiru,11/10/2020,Well prepared area. Large and spacious pitches. Stone floor. You have showers 1 euro 5 min of hot water. Emptying and filling comes into the price. You can catch with or without light. With electricity 11 euros it cost us. Beach walking in 10 min.
12758,1085829,5,Twin600SLT,08/10/2020,I have traveled a lot in Portugal and I have to say clearly that this motorhome park is one of the best on the coast. Friendly boss and a great team around my friend Mario. I look forward to spending the winter here every year.
12758,1083918,4,remy66,06/10/2020,"If you hesitate between the 2 areas, this one is planted with trees, the plots are larger and the whole is more airy, for me there is no photo during this Covid period ... but of course it remains a structure 100 places 75% occupied today. Home a little jaded but correct. For 10 € per day, it's hard to find better."
12758,1082728,3,johntiernan,05/10/2020,A good place to stay if somewhat clinical. Clearly my opinion. Pitches are a decent size but zero privacy. Showers an extra €1 washing machine available. Very quiet at night with a small supermarket and restaurant and bars nearby. Short walk to a stunning beach. €10 a night if you stay for 2 nights plus including electricity.
12758,1080210,5,dillydays,03/10/2020,"This is an excellent place to stay! We came for 2 nights and have extended and don’t want to leave. The pitches are all very large with electric and water hook ups very close. There are no toilets here as it’s mostly used by Motorhomes with a few campervans. There are showers 5mins for €1, clean and warm water. Clean laundry facilities for €4.50 for a wash. Short walk down a path to the beach, incredible red stone rocks and sandy beach. Lovely pizzeria Ristorante Capri a few minutes walk from the site - the vegetarian pizza is delicious! Everyone is quiet and the site is very calm. It feels safe and secure, an excellent find. Everyone is friendly and respectful. Would seriously recommend. The trees throughout the site offer some shade and are very picturesque. There are multiple washing lines, washing up stations. We’re very spoilt here!"
12758,1065035,4,davidalsinamercier,22/09/2020,"Impeccable and very good treatment. Although I would add more showers, more pots for washing dishes and toilets."
12758,1052438,5,Cakoka,16/09/2020,"Simply Perfect, everything you can ask for in an area, all the services, kindness, perfect distribution, sun, beach. We will repeat for sure."
12758,1047603,1,bitom,14/09/2020,"Beautiful rest area, wonderful beach reachable with a pleasant walk in the middle of nature. unfortunately, however, the arrogance of the managers ruins everything."
12758,1044823,5,MaxPijnenburg,13/09/2020,Fantastic spot. Very close to a beautiful beach and there’s a small town nearby with restaurants and there’s a supermarket across the street. Also a busstop to Albufeira. The camper place is quiet and clean. The only thing that misses is a public toilet.
12758,1044015,4,latecoaire,12/09/2020,Great locations! 10 euros with electricity! Just lack of toilets!
12758,1042089,2,pedromartinezlopez,11/09/2020,"Busy area, overly measured services thus subtracting comfort and efficiency, bad WiFi, electricity without power, the automatic has skipped many times, in other areas it had never happened to me, little water pressure and above all you have to hold the button, the best is the beach of falesia without leaving the area. Improving those simple details would be a better area."
12758,1025497,5,Almaben,04/09/2020,"Always a dissatisfied minority. If the price doesn't suit you, you shouldn't have gone in. To come to a service area, your motorhome must be equipped with a toilet, if you prefer public toilets during Covid times, it is your problem. The whole team is very friendly and hard working. It is true that they do not accept people who misbehave and make them understand that they must leave."
12758,1025205,1,evans1967,04/09/2020,"The ideal place, it is spoiled by the people who serve it, it is not very pleasant to deal with, my feeling that it serves foreigners better, as if you owe them something !!, the fatal Wi-Fi and the morning before leaving you already They have taken away and before time they are already asking you if you leave. Bad experience with the responsible, unpleasant and rude person, the area does not have bathrooms, the one next to it does and I think it's free, here there are only showers, € 1 5 min. It is also cheaper, here in September € 11, 3 adults and a child and without electricity, although at the beginning it said € 12.50"
12758,1024868,5,Urko,04/09/2020,"Very comfortable area, with a very good treatment by its managers."
12758,1019549,5,LindaLuc,01/09/2020,"We were only going to stay a few days ... But in the end it was 4 weeks. TOP CAMPER PLACE. Nice large and neat camper pitches. 11 € in August. With electricity, water, free wi-fi. The staff are super friendly. There are restaurants and a shop close by. And the beautiful beach can be reached 400 meters from the camper place. They see us here again."
12758,1006691,5,pacobeta,27/08/2020,We have spent 15 days in the great area all in very good condition one of the best back in which I have been
12758,1004646,5,kikarraxo,26/08/2020,"We went to drain (gray and black water) and for water, all for 3 euros, and perfect. We did not stay, it was just that and the treatment was good."
12758,984110,5,marcvoyage,20/08/2020,Very good welcome in French. The staff are friendly. I will stay a week with the sea at 500m
12758,975014,4,Lasolana,17/08/2020,"great place with good access to the beach, all great"
12758,960582,4,franckdouaud,14/08/2020,"Very clean area and large, pleasant personal location, private access to the beach, a few shops nearby, very reasonable price"
12758,957053,3,costaz,13/08/2020,"Very good park, pity that in August it is full and you have to wait time to enter. Whoever has the patience to wait. Whoever wants to flush the toilet is supplying / flushing water costs 3 € until 10 pm. Those who have no place can sleep next to the athletics park, 100m away. Location indicated to me by GNR."
12758,946063,5,Joricod,10/08/2020,Very well located area next to a magnificent beach. The night cost us € 12 and they have all the services. It is clean and very quiet. 100% recommendable to spend one or two boches before continuing with the route through the Algarve.
12758,943985,5,jeromar,09/08/2020,"Magnificent area with an extraordinary beach. It is always complete with a queue to enter. We spent two nights before in the area that they also have in Tavira and from there they reserved a place for us, so we could arrive and enter without queuing. All lucky."
12758,941983,4,luisada,09/08/2020,"This is great, the only drawbacks that I would put are the lack of shade, as in almost all areas, and having the ability to barbecue attached to the neighbor's plot, if they grill sardines you can not even open the ac because of the smoke that you It enters. It should be enabled place outside the plots."
12758,926862,5,jorgeaqf,04/08/2020,"Great! € 11 for August. Large spaces, water and electricity, 5 minutes from the beach and very attentive staff!"
12758,925187,5,jpozroz,03/08/2020,"A wonder, quiet, all kinds of services, super clean and tidy, very good."
12758,914442,5,Nandoxx,31/07/2020,"Area of the best on the peninsula. Well organized, clean, large pitches, (not all have electricity) good discharge station .... we stayed two nights, the first without electricity and the second with electricity. The staff, super nice and professional staff. The beach 400 meters and spectacular. To see photos."
12758,913106,5,kanuca,30/07/2020,Very nice place to stay
12758,909095,5,Corbacho76,29/07/2020,A site of 10. More like that would have to see.
12758,909064,5,jnegrao,29/07/2020,"One of the best Motorhome parks that I have stayed at, even internationally. it is a pity that there are no more parks of these spread throughout our Portugal. Very good location and services"
12758,898054,4,soares_silva,25/07/2020,"Very good as expected, it has few baths and few sinks to wash, without a bathroom, only those from the motorhome, but an interesting park, coming back."
12758,892718,4,JC75,23/07/2020,"The area is very good. The best thing of all is that it has the beach at 500 m, and the plots are wide. The worst, to put something down, is that there are many people for the services it offers (sink, showers, etc.), and that the filling of water in the water change area is by a push-button tap."
12758,887701,4,pepaypaco,21/07/2020,"Very well everything, the beach is one of the best and also the water is very hot, very large plots and the very kind gentlemen"
12758,885076,5,Benni83,21/07/2020,"Great place with a great location! Got here by accident. The place is very full, which is why we only got one place without electricity. But that's not a problem either, we were allowed to draw electricity from our neighbors. The warm showers are neat, clean and look fairly new. 5 minutes of showers cost 1 €. The beach can be reached on foot via a sidewalk and a long wooden staircase within 5 minutes. For € 9.50 in high season, this motorhome parking space is definitely recommended."
12758,879420,3,nounita,19/07/2020,"Large area, overcrowded at this time. (motorhomes wait in front and on the sides to be able to find a place). We were lucky we got there and got a spot with a little shade an hour later. Very clean washing machine € 4.50. Free cold shower (but in plain sight therefore minus one star for lack of privacy). 10 minutes walk from the large beach of falesia. The wifi obviously does not work as on the Tavira area. And it's much too noisy if you want to rest. Otherwise it's clean the pitches are well demarcated."
12758,871777,4,kaethefreutsich,15/07/2020,"Nice place, clean showers. Great way to the beach. Warning: there are no toilets. We were there with the T3."
12758,871204,5,karrete,15/07/2020,"Very large plots with some shade that the one next to it does not have. Try to take a place at the end, the closest to the beach because you have a 400-meter walk to the shore and these days of heat it weighs the walk in full sun. Nearby is a restaurant and supermarket. If you want to visit the villages take the bike because it is a bit far. Ideal to disconnect. Family beach. € 10 including electricity and wifi"
12758,863528,5,Valbu,12/07/2020,"Many people. Noisy. No covid protocol, receptionists without masks ..."
12758,857171,5,KrystalShip,09/07/2020,"Lovely aire, very well maintained and plots nicely spaced out. A bonus is the free cold showers. We parked up at the back of the site to be closer to the path to the beach, and it was quieter too. €9 per night incl EHU (June) when staying 4nights"
12758,853190,5,infante46,07/07/2020,"Currently operating, as expected, ac area with fairly large Chinese plots, some shaded. Free cold and hot showers at € 1. good loading - unloading area. € 10 per night with electricity. It is necessary to wear the ac xq not 100% level. If you are a light sleeper, take a seat at the end, there is a pub with drinks in front and some noise we have had, nothing important. recommend"
12758,813168,5,JLYR,31/05/2020,"Very beautiful area. Large and well maintained. Accessible shops. Magnificent pine forest, access to the beach, beautiful pitches and pleasant welcome. Only downside .. the showers were very basic ... but the news work started the last week of May 2020. We stayed there for 3 weeks. Was it a little paradise?"
12758,793424,5,jcdc,09/03/2020,"Perfect in every way. Large places, all nickel, Rigorous and commercial management, which requires respect from campers, silent, we will come back with great pleasure. come early ..."

Looked like the park was actually full. Friendly welcome and everything clearly explained. It was just like the motorhome park near Silves which is run by the same people.
12758,751172,5,ggs84,08/12/2019,"Attention we spent yesterday afternoon, it was full. It is advisable to call to reserve. There remained one place to the one that follows at 200m ..."

12758,748389,1,syncrosacha,30/11/2019,"This is the worst experience at an aire I have had in my 4 months travelling all around Europe. The people who run it are horrible. I paid for two nights, and the day before our departure I asked what time we would need to be out tomorrow. He said 6pm, which was close to our arrival time so all good. When the day comes, they come over at multiple times before 12pm saying to my partner you need to be gone now, which we couldn’t as we had just hung out the washing and I was out surfing and uncontactable. Then when I returned he said we could stay til 4pm, so we said fine. Then come 2pm they said we need to be out now. The two guys kept coming over all day even though they said to us the time we had to leave the day before, which we paid for. It really upset my partner and it ruined our experience. I honestly don’t know what all the high ratings are about, it’s just a standard gravel floored aire. Plus there are no toilets at all, which I’ve never seen before, and no hot water. The aire was full and we got the last space which is in the car park with no electricity available which was rubbish. I will be going next door next time, it cannot be worse than this. Read the other comments, the money grabbing owners clearly have an attitude problem."

Good points, clean, beautiful pitches, direct access to the beach which is superb, petanque, ping ping, tables ok and hot showers for 0.50 cts. Negative Wi Fi you just have it if you are near the reception otherwise nothing, no cold shower, just a cold tap outside, for the card payment it is after 3 days. Home of the big amiable limit. We took 2 night we will not be back. We tried but everyone sees with their own eyes."

There are full services excluding electricity. There are 3 bays for grey waste.

The grey waste is a grid with great direction.

The black WC drain is 600mm off the ground. The drain has good direction with very little splashback. The cassette push button tap is above the drain with a little hose and low pressure hence no splashback.

The fresh water tap is a medium screw-on connection with a push button tap with excellent pressure. 

There is a large rubbish bin at the entrance along with recycling bins.

There were many motorhomes staying here and the place looks immaculately clean."

Actually, I like to be free, but if you want a little company, I can recommend this place without restrictions. Although the place has gravel as a base, the staff goes through anyway and even sweeps the individual pitches. Even if one stands on it. Fantastic. The unique Praia da Falesia can be reached on foot in about 3 minutes. Very many overwinterers on the course. When I came Sunday, I could still choose a free parking space. On Wednesday at departure everything was packed. I paid 7 euros per 24 hours in November 2018. At some point I'm guaranteed to be back!"

12758,379834,1,Morpion,22/09/2018,"Given the very noisy number, limit a henhouse at the time of release in boxes. The gray water drain has a strong smell of mud, which is not pleasant for people who are nearby. We had 2 bad nights, considering the noise. It's nice to see big, but when it becomes a tourist trap it scares those who are looking for some peace."

People take the bus, the last one is at 7 in the afternoon to the Albufeira. Another option is to rent a car and move. One of the workers in the area is quite unfriendly and sergeant. In general I recommend it but remember to go to the bottom of the area not at the beginning"

12758,339410,1,syvai,17/08/2018,"If I link the homepage this is a Cc area and not a campsite. To see the installation of some on this area, we have the impression to dream indeed more than 10 people on 2 sites for 1 Cc, the other vehicle present without equipment which means 1 toilet for all .... I let you guess where they are going to do their needs ..... moreover The paths leading to the beach are strewn with animal and human defections, that's why we Caudists are more and more repressed because of people without to know how to live and I pass you the noise with the children who shout the day and who turn in a circle in an area instead of going to a campsite.Avis to the amateurs and good luck"

The proximity to Falesia beach is a real plus. We have just spent two weeks there and left once again very satisfied, apart from the boss who is very friendly, we just regret the lack of courtesy and kindness of the staff. We felt seen more as location numbers than customers. Damage ! Be careful not to turn yourself into a tourist factory!"

The only downside is that it has no toilet, and although the showers are hot, they cost 0.50 € / 4 minutes. We pay € 6 without electricity. It is quite good, I would recommend it and would go back."

As it was full we only used the services and before I looked at their prices on their website: €2 to use only services. When I went to pay him he told me that it was €3 and that the website was not updated. And then he adds that €2 is for caravans and since it was an AC, the guy paid €3. What a joke!!

Negative point I've been a customer since it opened on my last visit 7/2017 Surprisingly, the hot showers that used to cost €0.50 and were enough to take a shower now have to be 2x0. 50 The water was not very hot"
12758,161347,5,titof56,30/07/2017,"Passing through in July, we managed to find a place there, reception a little cold, but hey, I don't spend my vacation with the receptionist. Otherwise everything is perfect."

12758,153524,5,CristinaLlamas,17/07/2017,"Ideal place. Two cold water showers. Two hot water showers (50 cents). €10.5 two people and van. Children do not pay until they are 5 years old. Fountains and water intake. No toilet or to clean dishes. Shade (but not abundant). Perfect location to go to the beach. It gets crowded at night, even though it is big. Don't worry. Clean. recommendable"

12758,141125,3,AlvaroBaez,06/06/2017,The place itself is very good. I was there taking a walk but I couldn't get in with my motorhome because it was full. The man who helped me recommended that next time I make a reservation or arrive in the morning.

This is the third time I've come, it's still so well maintained. 8 euros per day with electricity, on the other hand, the young man at reception is not at all welcoming, he forgets that he is in contact with customers, hello is not required at his place. It's very limited."

12758,121859,1,pladys,03/03/2017,"The wifi is matched only by the poor quality of the staff, including the boss, who has changed in his approach to the clientele since 2013. The smile is no longer part of the panoply but perhaps it must be born of the other side of a big river."
12758,118423,5,ConcordePortugal,16/01/2017,"Splendid area exclusively reserved for motorhomes, perfectly managed and organized by the owner and his two employees.

12767,2600824,1,SusanneBrunner,06/03/2023,"You can hardly imagine a more sloping place. The systems work and to empty the water, the car is at an angle so that the entire tank is actually empty."
12767,2462136,4,dosk,25/10/2022,"Unable to level ac in this area. Finally we park in the space reserved for the AC that they have put where the bus station. There is a gravel surface to the right of it, perfectly flat and with a ""no parking except motorhomes"" sign. We spent a totally quiet night there. Around eight in the morning there was a quarter of an hour of noise from buses"
12767,2250750,1,Josio,16/08/2022,"The most ridiculous RV park I've ever seen, and I've been at this for many years. It has such a slope that it is even dangerous, I don't even want to imagine what could happen if the parking brake fails while you are sleeping."
12767,2241133,1,mncosta112,15/08/2022,"Well cared for parking area, well located and with capacity for 9 motorhomes. I would have given it 4 stars if it weren't for the slope that varies between 10 and 15 degrees. It is indeed a pity. With this inclination, be careful with the clutch when maneuvering if the vehicle is very heavy, it immediately smells of burning. And be more careful with the tilt of the gas fridge flame!"
12767,1980392,1,jockey,15/06/2022,Complete ASA without electricity. The terrain is very sloping. about 10% slope. Even with stabilizers it is not possible to level the Motorhome. It's a shame the municipality spends the money and then drives away the motorhomes. I'm here alone.
12767,1906259,1,monge79,22/05/2022,"Unthinkable to see such a sloping ground and as I don't like to sleep standing up, I left! I don't have 40 cm high wedges! Beyond my words, I would like to know the engineer who has so much incompetence for an achievement that is certainly very beautiful but unusable because it is dangerous!"
12767,1791416,1,reisande,22/03/2022,very bad to park even on high trestles crooked as a ....
12767,1551320,1,Anuskabelzu,05/09/2021,We have reached out to check the comments. It is really a shame that they have made so much expense to prepare such a sloping place to spend the night !!!! It's crazy !!!! Let's see if they spend the money consistently !!!! What a pity
12767,1223142,1,SaraSantoa,28/05/2021,"Very uneven. Impossible to level the motorhome, even with the ramps."
12767,1170053,1,nunopelicano,08/04/2021,"Bad ... dangerous and uncomfortable. To make a mistake is not serious ... bad is not to correct the mistake. Whoever designed it should not have any notion of what is essential. Not even as levelers can you balance the Motorhome. I went ... we gave up and stayed in Bragança, which has an excellent park. Of course, the city and commerce ended up winning with that."
12767,1170052,1,Lapracasa1972,08/04/2021,Very bad!!! Whoever designed the space does not know what a motorhome is. Ideal space NOT to be used by motorhomes. Go to Bragança or Macedo de Cavaleiros!
12767,981359,1,tonypaella,19/08/2020,"How incompetent a municipality can be, it is impossible to level up. wasted money"
12767,893191,3,Celiamariafialho,24/07/2020,Very quiet place with view but difficult to place the vehicle in line even with holds.
12767,892601,1,Andoni.G,23/07/2020,A place with a lot of slope. we went somewhere else
12767,875178,2,AdelinoCosta,17/07/2020,Disposal of dirty water and free cassette disposal and clean water supply. Local with a lot of inclination
12767,817554,1,Freigeist12,05/06/2020,Pitches steep incline.
12767,795321,5,ElwouenLouise,14/03/2020,Water with excellent flow. The only fault very steep. We were passing so it was perfect
12767,779002,1,offagain,11/02/2020,Black water drain is blocked making the liquid run over the road and the place very smelly.
12767,750215,1,wistro,05/12/2019,"It's free, but it's pretty worthless. In most places, bevels cannot be compensated with supports or wedges. Even at the service point, there is a strong imbalance. Quite nonsensical facility. Except for supply and disposal (with difficulty) not recommended. Too bad the town is beautiful."
12767,634010,1,LNC,16/08/2019,"Very very sloping. impossible to sleep, even with very large holds. services even more sloping, but very clean, a good troubleshooting to empty, no more."

12769,3278828,4,goten,10/09/2023,Only three places... there was no one... I was there for a while... but to drain and collect water it was closed.
12769,3257910,4,FranEncinas,04/09/2023,"It is a little neglected, but it has three parking spaces, and the services are in the first cleaning station. Grey, black water and tap with 1/2 thread with good pressure. We were only there to load fuel and empty and fill water. Cleaning stations do not work"
12769,2727787,4,familiarebelo,06/05/2023,"It has 3 overnight spaces, water and waste in the washing area on the left side. With electricity points in the shed before washing on the right. All free but with a 72h stay limit."
12769,2715346,1,Mjmf,02/05/2023,...on the wing only the plate....it's just for parking....no water or waste.

12770,3249507,4,SMC1957,02/09/2023,Made black and gray water. Infrastructure is tight but everything worked perfectly. 5 euros seems like a lot to me. But I paid for it freely because I needed it.
12770,3128029,3,Familielangen,12/08/2023,"We have not been here, but they sell chemical toilet fluid here, which is hardly available anywhere in Spain. Very handy. You can also empty the toilet for 3 euros. Nice man at the reception. Thank you!"
12770,2601937,2,tigre31,07/03/2023,Area near the road to access the beach you have to go along the road not practical area just for sleeping emptying refueling it is all no charm
12770,2561435,4,orilys,27/01/2023,pleasant welcome but the services are not free. it's 5€ to fill and empty your tanks.
12770,2515358,4,marzar,07/12/2022,"great park up
stayed 13th November 2019
bus into Malaga, great place"
12770,2041702,1,joselito33,05/07/2022,"The bathrooms and the toilet are in a booth, it is less hot in an oven, the toilet smells like the portable toilets at the fair, I had to go in without breathing because of how bad it smells, I do not recommend it, we will not return, very bad experience."
12770,1971403,4,jlmorsan72,12/06/2022,"Good place to spend a couple of nights, the only problem is having to cross the road, the rest is fine. I do not recommend the Búho beach bar, the place is very good but the service is a disaster..."
12770,1924857,3,lostorrepalma,28/05/2022,"to be a Motorhome area it is not bad at all, it is not very luxurious but it has all its services, and enough shade from the palm trees, for those who ship more comforts they have to pay for a campsite and not an area"
12770,1913656,4,jorfesos,24/05/2022,"We were last Saturday night, it is not a spectacular place but it has shades of palm trees, they let you stay 24 hours from the moment you enter, it has the minimum services of grey, black and filling water; and the beach across the road. No noise and more than enough space between pitches. They charged us 12 euros, and the only negative is that they charged us 3 euros for a 2 year old."
12770,1905982,3,jrjoe44,21/05/2022,"Arrived at 7:30 p.m., just to spend the night. 12 € with electricity. The sanitary facilities are very average but functional. Hot water is a little long in coming. The setting is not very idyllic but enough to spend a night. The reception is very friendly."
12770,1752072,2,offer64,10/02/2022,"very noisy, national next door. large motorhome abstain, places not very long (no more than 7.40m). bus stop 500m to go to the center of malaga (2.50€, 1 hour by bus). emptying area not practical. very welcoming staff. but not too much choice, everything is full everywhere at the beginning of February!"
12770,1746586,3,PaulundPauline,03/02/2022,"Level gravel parking space for €12/24h (2 adults and camper). Electricity etc. included. Sanitary facilities in bad condition. Beach access 500m/5min away. Friendly reception. Street runs right in front of the square, but little traffic at night. Dogs bark at night."
12770,1729781,4,patou19,08/01/2022,4 stars without using the showers so the area is super quiet with beautiful palm trees service area for 12 € current included
12770,1702454,5,SteffenWolf,03/12/2021,5 stars because we stayed here even though the main square was full. We only stayed one night and were satisfied. But it's not for high demands - I think :) Thank you very much for the emergency shelter
12770,1640716,1,Begosasu,12/10/2021,"A place that is left, the showers impossible to use, the broken taps, the bathrooms almost the same because they are full of water all over the floor. They charge € 16 24 hours per motorhome and 2 people, then € 3 per extra person, a family with 3 children gets € 25 for the night, I think it's amazing for how bad the facilities are, a shame, let's see if they fix it and they put it in conditions"
12770,1508749,2,lyhibou,24/08/2021,Have a good night on the road close but not noisy sanitary another temp beach not far but you have to cross a road without pedestrian crossing or light at night Excellent restaurant on the beach price 24 € electricity 4 person and drain on the other hand no water at fill shady spot
12770,1493600,3,estelavs,21/08/2021,"To spend a night with the motorhome is not bad. Beach 100m across the road and quiet place. Of course, the showers are so old that the drain does not drain and your feet puddle, quite disgusting. The environment very soulless."
12770,1425563,4,Regao,08/08/2021,"We have been 3 days, € 16 / day with electricity included that they force you to take. The site is good, with palm trees that provide some shade, just 100m from the beach across the road and a 10-minute walk from the town. Old but functional bathrooms, showers, laundry and sinks. Quiet place without noise despite being next to the road. The best staff, attentive and very nice."
12770,1123294,2,kitti,23/12/2020,Parking space for caravans and in between some parking spaces for motorhomes and that for 12 euros. It's way too expensive for the space. The sanitary facilities are totally superimposed. I cannot recommend the place

12770,737706,3,Roadcaptain,03/11/2019,"Even if I think 12 euros too much, in this area you do not have much choice. It is not a campsite! The showers are hot, even if the men only 1 shower head is to use. A new hose would do. But you should wear bathing shoes. The toilet is usable. The electricity and wifi work. The V / E fits too. If the place was elsewhere, there would be at most 2 stars."
12770,736395,3,kitti,02/11/2019,On this place you stand between parked caravans and mobile homes. No nice view and that costs 12 Euro per day. That's just too expensive for this place
12770,731590,4,trinfrance,27/10/2019,"WiFi useless. Room to sit outside camper with table and chairs, toilets and showers are ok but nothing special. Today cost us 12 euro for 2 persons (3 euro a day for additional person) but that is with electricity, grey and black waste and water fill. There is also a washing machine and dryer available.

Officially, it is a parking, unofficially you can sleep there with service (electricity, water, drain, wifi, garage on site). As it is unofficial, we must not leave awnings and table out, but widely tolerated for meals and drinks. Bus 50 m direction Malaga or Nerja for 1.17 € / person. Guarded parking 24h / 24h, quiet walk insured. beach at 500 m. Really recommended place for 10 € / 24h, very nice welcome and very helpful staff. Good road motorhome friends, next stop Benamaldena. See you soon."
12777,3257818,5,Andreita5,04/09/2023,"We spent a very quiet night (flat to sleep) although it is an exposed site and there were gusts of strong wind. There is a fountain and tables and a bbq but there is no garbage (you have to pick up everything and take it with you). The road up from one side is very narrow, but with the van no problem."

12777,2236137,5,txio,14/08/2022,"Great site, but note that the climb up Itziar, accessible by paved road in many long stretches, is one lane and there are hairpin bends with a steep upward slope. With an integral of 7m well but luckily we did not coincide with anyone against us. The landscape of the climb however, very bucolic."
12777,2225992,5,insofia,12/08/2022,"Beautiful place. Few people, wild horses and lots of nature, we visited in August and it was 22 degrees."
12777,2178565,5,KangooroGZ,05/08/2022,We spent the night here. Ideal site for vans. Tranquility and routes from the parking lot. Will surely repeat. The best in this area.

12777,1536592,2,Elpolo96,01/09/2021,Actually a nice place only at night people came by who were very loud and were not considerate and in the morning we were woken up by road works and several cars. Except for a few paper towels very clean but the drinking water didn't work for us. There are no trash cans so take your trash with you! The tables are good to eat there.
12777,1463800,5,ACgreen,16/08/2021,"Very quiet night. Emblematic site, yes, if you go in AC, don't even think about going up the side of Itziar, not narrow, the following, I mean above all the last 3km before the top. Greetings"
12777,1457678,5,Nathalia,14/08/2021,"Wonderful place with drinking water, fireplaces and a beautiful mystic forest. we stayed 3 nights without any problems. don't let anything outside while sleeping - there are free roaming horses that are very interested in your things ;) TAKE YOUR TOILETPAPER (and kitchenwaste) WITH YOU!!! to not ruin the image of the camper community (and the horses health of course) thanks."
12777,1380034,5,Negorida,29/07/2021,We spent one night and the truth was that we were great. Super quiet and peaceful. In the morning some cars of hikers. ATTENTION! You will be awakened by some nice horses who want to eat your breakfast;) You can see the sea in the background. 100% recommendable.
12777,1371742,5,Periquillo,27/07/2021,"All peace and quiet, although two trucks have arrived (I suppose to load wood tomorrow) that have been parked as seen in the photo. We have also enjoyed a herd of mares that have approached the car park. Tomorrow when I wake up I will tell how the night was."

12813,3191107,2,Kibafurg,20/08/2023,"There is very little space and on top of that some motorhomes occupied several places, they also park cars. It is next to a road that has a lot of traffic, noisy and being asphalt and cobblestones, a lot of heat is concentrated. The town deserves a view, yes. We went to the Cambra area, 15 minutes away, much better!"
12813,2957811,4,Marycoei,13/07/2023,"Service area working perfectly. The parking lot is small and people occupy more than one space. Staying overnight is allowed for up to 48 hours. The surrounding area is beautiful, very green, tracks to walk and the best thing is the river, the water is very calm to enter. You can visit the Roman baths and participate in some thermal activity in the nearby spas, the price is between 20 and 25 euros."
12813,2850041,3,kellysito,13/06/2023,"It is not suitable for many motorhomes as the spine parking was made for cars. It's a small village, you can visit everything on foot perfectly."
12813,2636395,5,Inexitah,02/04/2023,"Free place with free water and waste (max 48h), in a privileged place overlooking the river and an extensive green area with picnic tables, WC, for beautiful walks. Close to the village, the spa and the Roman spa. Parking spaces are small, which means that we have to occupy more than one. Some road noise, but quiet at night. Thanks to whoever designed this place!"
12813,2600978,3,ElVeterano,06/03/2023,OK for one night all services working. Cafe/bar just opposite the large hotel on the other side of the river. Quiet at night.
12813,2278236,3,TheBoucheMan,21/08/2022,Very pretty little village! Free and authorized site with water point and emptying. But the busy road is very painful and in addition the holidays on weekends in season! If you want to have a good night: go your way. The positive is the daytime toilets and the nice location.

Our idea was to go to the thermal baths, but the last entry is at 5:15 p.m. BUT much more important is the price for 90 minutes €25 is awesome, that doesn't fit into the moderately frequented spa town. Here we were alone."

The municipal authorities fine, I have seen it, in one case due to a neighbor's complaint, I heard him call them. The only positive thing is that it is close to the old town. I have not used the services so I do not give an opinion on that, nor have I checked if there are any."

There are very few spaces for vehicles of +5m and in the normal spaces they fine you. It also has tables, services (for a fee, we do not use them).

Nasty discussion with police.Many with van consider their vehicle “autocaravana” in spanish.

great."

12848,2645710,5,manelpm,07/04/2023,Comfortable and close to the town. Thank you city hall for these types of areas.
12848,2639831,5,MKSyMNA,04/04/2023,"Ideal place for AC and spend the night with gray water services, emptying and water (paying €1-100L) next to the town center. Quiet place and surrounded by other AC. We stayed the night of 03/31/2023"
12848,2635130,5,JudithCS,02/04/2023,"Right at the entrance of the village, Lekeitio can be visited on foot. wide space with many parking spaces, ideal for spending the night"
12848,2621461,4,mikelolaba,23/03/2023,Good parking and quiet. Thank you Lekeitio!
12848,2615186,4,Peraltilla46,19/03/2023,"Good place but to improve. Today there are four parked motorhomes that use the area as regular parking. Some even with wedges to hide. It seems that the two-night maximum is an orientation. In the evenings until 11:30 the town's kids meet at the existing tables, not making it easy to rest."
12848,2613106,2,joeandpuppy,17/03/2023,"Very full. Police drive by regularly. Loud youth meeting place at the tables in front of the mobile homes in the evening. Beautifully located and close to the beach, but sleep is only possible to a limited extent due to the kiddies..."
12848,2609279,4,julien46140,14/03/2023,"Quiet night be careful to respect the size of the places, for the water you have to go to the village to get a token at the tourist office"
12848,2593870,3,damien31,28/02/2023,good for visiting the port and the old town complicated paying service tourist office token an impeccable night
12848,2585958,4,jpdo33,21/02/2023,Alright. Narrow pitches. Superb city tour. nice walk and beautiful views.
12848,2582142,4,bedejo,18/02/2023,Nice quiet place but very oblique. Park in the right places. police check regularly and issue fines immediately. Tonight at 20:00 the police came by and sent away all incorrectly placed campers and those that were not included were fined. The town itself is nice to walk around.
12848,2581906,4,VanneBur,18/02/2023,"Very organized parking, there is a separate area for cars and motorhomes. Located at the beginning of the town, 4 minutes walk from the center. It is not allowed to circulate through the center with motorhomes. Free water emptying but paid water filling."
12848,2550092,3,Adriatour,12/01/2023,Great place. Regular police on site. Nice walk into town. Stood safely.
12848,2544832,4,LidiaDePradenaMelero,07/01/2023,"A very good place to rest with services, recommended. I don't really agree with the €3 cost of water in a country that doesn't know what to do with water."
12848,2544295,4,monfermat,06/01/2023,Very quiet place and close to the town.
12848,2541632,4,ArgiBengoetxea,04/01/2023,"Although it is necessary to wear socks, it is a pleasant place and close to the town."
12848,2541604,5,AneB,04/01/2023,"Although it is on a slope, it is a recommended place. Great to get to know Lekeitio. The lower parking lots are spacious, and have tables and gardens at the back. We spent one night there, without any problems!"
12848,2528410,5,Grimfang,26/12/2022,Clean free pitches close to idyllic town center and coast. Incl. V/E and a picnic area. Very quiet at night.
12848,2523993,5,pascal63,18/12/2022,beautiful service area with a nice mini zoo right next door and the city quite close on foot
12848,2520086,4,anapons10,12/12/2022,Great to get to know Lekeitio.
12848,2519429,4,sjmotorhome,11/12/2022,"Stayed here for one night. It is an ok place to stay, 5 min walk into town and beach. The only noise was the other campers just talking to load behind our van but other than that all good. Thank you"
12848,2519008,4,larsGrewenig,11/12/2022,"good place but unfortunately a bit noisy because people meet there to celebrate, but only went until 11:00 p.m."
12848,2518042,5,Abotargues78,10/12/2022,Just as previous reviews describe. Perfect to rest without noise.
12848,2509235,5,Beardedgrouch,30/11/2022,Great place for an overnight stay. Nice walk through the village and on the island. Facilities present and working. Water is paid.
12848,2495562,4,dmreina,14/11/2022,"Free area in Lekeitio, super good, quiet and very close to the town, it has stone tables and benches behind it, you have to put on chocks, somewhat inclined. Possibility of water by taking a card at the tourist office next to the port."
12848,2492858,2,bluesman42,12/11/2022,DC space full. I put myself in front of the cc's and took an 80€ plum. Otherwise the city is nice
12848,2485199,3,Arto2018,06/11/2022,"Perfect parking space, but strong inclination on all places. The port is definitely worth a visit."
12848,2474321,4,TanoPereira,31/10/2022,"Exclusive area for Camper or AC, with drinking water tap (it is necessary to buy a card at the tourist office). You sleep peacefully because it is not attached to the town and you are surrounded by people with good vibes. Although it smelled a bit bad if you are glued to the gray water area. Don't be late... or you run out of room."
12848,2469723,5,KevClarc,29/10/2022,"Great FREE park up. Services as detailed lovely & clean bins emptied every day even a full bike service point. we stayed over a weekend, some local kids sit on the picnic benches in the evening & chat but not on a school night, they were no trouble & police patrol regularly anyway. 3 peaceful nights.  5 mins walk into lovely town, great facility provided by the community would use again."
12848,2468216,4,frintropergrill,29/10/2022,"Good place, get there early and stick to the rules even if others don't."
12848,2468213,4,emilie19,29/10/2022,Very well located for visiting the city and going to the beach. Possibility to empty the waste water and the toilet but to fill the water tank you need relay euro tokens. We did not fill in but the tokens can be bought at the tourist office.
12848,2466154,5,outdoor-px,28/10/2022,"Great place for a city tour. As others have written, only park in the correct zones. A camper parked on the side received a speeding ticket directly. Draining gray water is theoretically possible, but unfortunately there are also campers in these areas overnight."
12848,2465584,5,Isabel567,27/10/2022,"Free area and well located. Loading and unloading area. It is not level, but fixable with the shims."
12848,2464568,3,Chris64240,27/10/2022,Area a little sloping but quiet at night ideal for visiting the city
12848,2460117,4,Monimanu,24/10/2022,"If there is space, it is very good, close to the town and the beach, even with shade. It's worth the stop. Water with a flat fountain tap, with the rubber adapter and a little force you can fill it without paying."
12848,2455624,1,Picolo47,21/10/2022,Absolutely avoid weekends. Hordes of picnickers who respect nothing. Too bad because the village and its port are worth the detour. To do during the week.
12848,2455399,1,carpette2,21/10/2022,"we have just done 400 km and we have not found a place on the 3 previous areas we arrived at 7 p.m. and no more places for motorhomes, however some vans take our place we managed to accommodate ourselves next to the garbage cans not glamorous never again we will not come back to do this part of Spain very badly received"
12848,2453119,3,ifarre,20/10/2022,"AC area without more. You can empty gray and black water but to fill it you have to pay a token at the tourist office. We don't use it. Closer to the town than it seems, 10-15' walk. Good to spend a night and visit the town and the island."
12848,2451205,4,Yerar14,19/10/2022,Good area for AC. The town center is very close. Quite well leveled. The bad thing is that some vans less than 6 meters long park in the AC area.
12848,2450727,5,JoeMal,18/10/2022,"Top place. Illuminated, quiet, clean, seating on a lawn, trash can right on the square and drinking water. Folks, anyone who is still complaining here doesn't get it!!! This is a free parking space in the city, if visitors misbehave and leave garbage, the operator can't help it. The police come by regularly and check that everything is in order."
12848,2450263,2,susanavito,18/10/2022,"Few spaces for motorhomes and vans. They kicked us out for standing out in a square that was supposed to be for 5 m. (our van measures 5.40 m.). They sent us to another area further away, which has many spaces for cars and only 8 spaces in which we could fit in line. They also kicked us out of a truck and bus parking lot, which was almost empty. Lots of discrimination!"
12848,2434660,4,EXPERIENCE,10/10/2022,"Motorhome area, quiet at night and in the morning with the songs of the birds, yes, busy in the morning. The services as they say in other comments. Dirty! No way. Important, very accessible to walk to the town to visit. Inclination, also some if others is just going in reverse. Overall good."
12848,2407941,2,D.Humo,27/09/2022,"Very busy and somewhat dirty area. The main issue we saw is tilt. In the end we decided not to spend the night there. Still, it's free and for motorhomes it's not bad. Especially considering that in Lekeitio it is extremely difficult to park."
12848,2401748,5,star97,25/09/2022,Perfect high traffic area. It is free. We can only thank this pretty village. This area deserves to be a little bigger. No electricity but it's free!
12848,2371487,3,Has4night,14/09/2022,"Excellent solution for the night, however, the (free) unloading area is very dirty and the token (which is used only for drinking water) is on sale from the tourist office and is closed on Mondays and no one sells it. The police come several times a day and move the vans, vans in the car area and send the campers away if out of the camper area! No space is flat but they are all inclined."
12848,2365969,2,QuentIndeuxtrois,12/09/2022,we stayed there for a while. no height. ample free parking. that is the only advantage. there is trash everywhere! the people ! There are trash cans in the parking lot! an effort!. fine for one night.
12848,2363131,5,eresmasfeoqueayer,11/09/2022,"Important: in the ac area, only motorhomes over 5 meters. The vans can spend the night in the car park as long as it does not exceed 5 meters, regardless of its category in the technical file, we are not fined and it is allowed. But the motorhomes more than 5 meters if they park where the cars fine them, let's not occupy the Ac Area with vans. Please let's be civil."
12848,2355584,4,irenezzurita,09/09/2022,"You can only park in the zone enabled for motorhomes, which was full when we arrived. We parked outside this one and the police arrived and explained that we had to leave to avoid the fine and helped us find a place. Non-drinking water is free and there is a gray and black water service. For drinking water you have to pay."
12848,2355492,1,Dilamd33,09/09/2022,"The places reserved for motorhomes were all occupied, partly by fairground people, partly by vehicles under 5m. With our converted 6m van, we parked in the car spaces at the top of the car park while we went to the beach (2 hours) and we already had a ticket on the way back. So beware zero tolerance of the police!"
12848,2336623,3,rosaamarilla,03/09/2022,"Very few spaces for cars... all occupied by carnies... but luckily, one left and we were able to park... Fiesta Mayor this weekend."
12848,2330114,5,zedmax,01/09/2022,Recommended when there are no fairs. Central area with a length limited to 5m (as per sign). Be careful because towards the late afternoon the police always come to check. Convenient but often full motorhome parking spaces above 5 m. Recommended.
12848,2305345,1,sunlita,26/08/2022,"There is no room, all the places are occupied by stallholders and they won't let you park anywhere else, FINE!!"
12848,2296938,1,txemaba,24/08/2022,"Area full of caravans of fairgrounds, there are only 5 places left. I have parked in the spaces next door, but the municipal police have not allowed me to, arguing that the spaces are for vehicles of 5 meters maximum. Mine is 5.40, my 5 cm did not stick out, I do not understand. Then in winter they will want us to go, they have it bad with me, there are places wanting us to go."
12848,2296108,4,arboldelevas,24/08/2022,"Paid filling area (tab 3/100 liters at the tourist office) and free emptying. Water fountain and tables to eat. A 15 minute walk is the town. Get lost in its streets and reach the beach, amazing. There are 3 more car parks, but they won't let us have .2 with clearance limits and one for trucks."
12848,2295117,1,peretubi,24/08/2022,Area reserved and occupied 100% by caravans of fairgrounds.
12848,2263799,3,carlaguiix,18/08/2022,Thanks to the city council of Lekeito for this free area. Area very close to the town and mandatory stop is well worth it even though it is well worth it.
12848,2262235,4,Alcazarteam,18/08/2022,"The car park is fine, quite full, next to a residence with a mini bird zoo that can be visited. The water, as they say, €3 per 100 litres, we haven't spent the night but it doesn't seem very noisy. Very close to Lekeito, just five minutes. IMPORTANT: on August 22 parking for motorhomes is prohibited."
12848,2256314,3,xeniasoriano,17/08/2022,"It is very well located to visit Lekeitio. The problem is that there is very little parking AND it is difficult to find (Although you can sleep where the cars park, only if you are less than 6 meters long). There is clean water and to deposit gray water, but we don't get to use it. We were one night."
12848,2241039,3,Salva1960,15/08/2022,"It is a large car park but the motorhome area is limited, about 20 spaces, the rest for cars. There is to empty the water but to fill the water you have to pay, 100 litres/€3 and you get a card for it at the tourist office that is in the town, 1 km more or less. I ask the City Council to increase the number of spaces for AC in the parking lot because it is always full and the water is coin-operated or free."
12848,2197415,1,auto9898,08/08/2022,"Difficult access by mountain road. A chaos of Area and place. Confined and poorly maintained. Cars and motorhomes in the same parking lot. Water with a token that you buy “I don't know where” or you pour the water from the toilet faucet. Few places, so if there is no place, half way around the mountain road. Difficult or impossible to find an alternative. Think about it before you go. Bad experience. I won't go back or remember it."
12848,2196115,1,pfloresbb,08/08/2022,"Many limitations throughout the town, we have a van that is more than 5 long and more than 2.5 high, so it has been impossible to park in any of the car parks. So, after wasting time we have been left without seeing Lequeitio"
12848,2193748,5,Salvamar75,07/08/2022,"Parking with 28 exclusive spaces for motorhomes, with free gray/black water emptying services. The City Council is to be thanked for such an area and many should pick up the example."
12848,2160090,4,josemaria27,02/08/2022,"Good area, and very nice town, police fining a lot if you don't comply with the rules, if people with a small van of less than 5 meters, they will park in the center they can, they would leave more room for large ac, you have to arrive early to get a seat"
12848,2153142,5,isabeortiz,31/07/2022,"It's great, next to the botanical park and near the center"
12848,2146097,4,Coolboy,30/07/2022,Great area to visit the village and the St Nicolas rock... A little noisy but nothing more
12848,2134139,5,armar,28/07/2022,"Area with services. Shims are allowed. Near the beach and the harbor. Do not park outside established places as they fine. Very busy. Payment water terminal. There is a bike service point with tools, inflation and pressurized water to wash bikes."
12848,2111135,1,didinas,23/07/2022,"The area is shared with a car park, when I arrived all the motorhome sites were occupied and I travel with a van, so I parked it in the same car park but in the central area (apparently it is totally prohibited there), I went out to see the town and on the way back already had a fine. Be careful where you park, little tolerance."
12848,2104932,1,crpm,22/07/2022,"AWFUL AREA. I have NEVER seen that to get water you have to pay with a token that can ONLY be bought at the tourist office, which logically has restricted hours. If you arrive at 7 pm... to wait until the next day. On the other hand, there is no restriction on hours of stay and there are quite a few motorhomes who spend several days there, which makes it difficult to find a place."
12848,2092690,5,Montse07,19/07/2022,"Paved camper area with stone picnic tables, emptying and filling gray water and chemical toilet. The filling of water is paid and the coin is taken to the tourist office of the town. 15 minutes walk from the center, port and beach."
12848,2087022,5,chester.81,17/07/2022,"I wonder, but how can you give 1 star, if you are violating the precise rules that are written in plain sight !!! we are really Italians !!! the place is very quiet and just because the police pass frequently, also very safe. in summer you have to wait for a seat, maybe even 1 hour, but sooner or later someone always goes away. definitely recommended, maybe avoid the weekend."
12848,2086373,3,anamungar,17/07/2022,"We left the van parked to visit the town with the intention of sleeping in another place since some comments about fines scared us. When we got back there were a lot of vans and we decided to spend the night. We didn't have any problems, but we tried not to draw too much attention. The squares were a bit slanted."
12848,2080448,1,gioia51,16/07/2022,"Happened on Saturday, I confirm the previous comments, always crowded, we dared to go up where there were so many vehicles, stop for a moment to understand how to get out that immediately the Police arrives. Time to leave another patrol, ready to tell us that NO PARK only at Park number 1. obviously saturated and even there in action to make fines, for those out of stalls. I do not recommend in the high season."
12848,2074713,2,AnnaPallarolas,15/07/2022,We were able to empty gray and black water but not fill the tank since it is necessary to buy a token at the tourist office that is inside the town (they close at 7:00 p.m.) and for this they told us to go through pedestrian streets impossible to access with an AC great. We left without filling.
12848,2073330,4,jammstyler,14/07/2022,Jammstyler was here. It is not an area!!! It is a car park with filling and emptying services. Somewhat uneven plots and with exact measurements for parking. . The police allow shoes and open windows. Removing chairs and tables is prohibited.
12848,2068487,5,Beckydawson,13/07/2022,Great stop with beach 15 minutes walk away. Make sure parked in correct bays as police check 3 to 4 times a day.€80 fine if in wrong place
12848,2062630,1,danielebailo,11/07/2022,"BEWARE OF FINES! Since all the spaces reserved for campers were occupied, we parked in the normal places (maximum 5 meters), however occupying only one place (in fact there was a hedge behind us and our camper does not reach 5.50 m). Upon return, after about three hours, there was a fine. The country is nice but it doesn't deserve 80 €."
12848,2062393,4,Aimpe,11/07/2022,"Perfect area to visit the village, very well located. It is very crowded and the police are constantly fining you if you are in the non-motorhome squares or if you take out chairs… the water is a bit expensive and the tokens bought at the tourist office fail…"
12848,2041787,3,dalvarez,05/07/2022,"Very busy area, mandatory to arrive mid-morning and put chocks, very uneven terrain. If you are taller than 5m, park in the AC zones and if you are 5m or shorter in the central spaces. The police pass by very often, the town is not very pet-friendly, in many places it is forbidden to enter with dogs."
12848,2028131,5,Purem,01/07/2022,Very good night here. Quiet car park with quick access to Lekeitio and its beach. We did not use the refill service.

12848,2017440,4,amelia.ltcs,28/06/2022,"Good location, close to the center. Good access. Good space for service area. Tonight the seats quickly sold out."
12848,1995413,3,Mike_wood,20/06/2022,"Parked here for one night while on route to San Sebastián. We arrived around 10.30 am and got the second to last space. Didn’t see any others leave after so would suggest getting there early. As others say make sure to park in the spaces only at the edge, police did come in the evening to check. Didn’t use water, but seemed to work with a token payment. Good little bike repair station"
12848,1994663,3,denech17,20/06/2022,"It is a car park, with places for motorhomes. ATTENTION, no table, no chairs, not even a piece of blind. The police come by every hour and they don't laugh. Otherwise nice seaside."
12848,1982882,4,mserranoherrero,16/06/2022,"Very close to the city and the beach (15' walk), it is free and quiet. It has space for about 20 motorhomes. We arrived at 7:00 p.m. and there were only two places left, so be careful if you go in the summer."
12848,1968139,4,Aloys52686,11/06/2022,"Busy today. Small campers in the middle (vans) is still possible. The rest is FULL. To get water but also in the town. By the way, a nice town. Discover it. Really recommended. Tip. Off parking lot. Left towards town. Take the first street on the left. Walk to the right of the road. There is a ""fully automatic"" toilet on your right."
12848,1942005,2,peponeburos,03/06/2022,I just put 2 stars because it is impossible to find the area with the GPS coordinates provided. So we went our way.

12848,1928421,5,Adrienvintage,29/05/2022,"Large parking lot, quiet, close to the city. ideal. be careful to come early because the places are coveted. it is forbidden to park in places less than 5m."
12848,1926254,1,cagey,28/05/2022,Park in marked motorhome bays only! They are very keen to fine you if you park ANYWHERE else in the whole town - they do not like AC's.
12848,1920146,4,RicardoMontoya,27/05/2022,"A very nice place, near the town and large squares, a free place, the bad thing, that to carry water you don't go with € coins and the plots are inclined, and as you arrive very late you don't park, we found a square and that was May and weekdays"
12848,1915531,4,Moeljaan,25/05/2022,Neat place to stay for a few nights. Close to the pleasant center with harbor and beach. Gray water discharge and chemical toilet and service place for bicycle repair. Obtain non-potable water. Drinking water get a coin...
12848,1895148,4,PauloMozBarbosa,16/05/2022,"Slightly sloping terrain that requires installing shims on the same side of the AC. Close to the center, port and beach. To supply drinking water, you need a form to be collected at the tourist office... As with many other facilities to receive AC, it was preferable to charge a small daily fee for the occupation of the place and the water being free."
12848,1889223,2,saroelena,14/05/2022,The area is fine but there are very few places for AC. a lot of parking up to 5 m but vans park in the AC area and outside it the police fine
12848,1881409,4,Betty2612,10/05/2022,"pleasant area not far from the city we did not have to take the water so I can't talk about it, we are 6/700 meters from the city, really close. a great walk in town a good little restaurant at the port, what could be better! a big thank you to the municipality for the place"
12848,1846598,2,Hondarribi,22/04/2022,"Everything is correct, but to put a but: to get clean water you need some tokens (jetons) that are provided at the tourist office, which has its days and hours. It would be better if it worked with coins, which we all have. Or have a token dispenser next to it that, in turn, will work with coins (as they exist in some areas)."

12848,1816540,3,kikubacu4,12/04/2022,"Quiet area. Try to get there early, otherwise the authorities, who think more than they are, will not let you park where you want, even though it is empty."
12848,1814402,4,tobiandlaura,10/04/2022,"Very handy for a free spot to visit the small town of Lekeitio. The police patrol regularly. To have sewage and clean water for small change. There are a few young people nearby who are a bit noisy, but otherwise it's okay."

Well lit at night. Lovely town to wander around, great beaches and a causeway to reach at low tide the island in front of the harbour. Thanks to the town council for this facility."

12848,1798077,4,SergioGata,27/03/2022,Area 15 min walk to the port. The plots are inclined but with some chocks it is solved. The police pass by constantly and if you are parked outside the pitches intended for motorhomes they will first warn you to leave but if you are not in the ac they will fine you. The tokens for filling the water are bought at the tourist office that is not close to the area.
12848,1797402,4,Philpod17,27/03/2022,"All-water service area. Paying water, token on sale at the tourist office. Only place where you can park without taking a pv."

12848,1761334,5,Rafac,20/02/2022,"Very good area to park the motorhome. We spent two nights, it has a water charge (prior payment at the Tourist Office). The gray and black water discharge service is free. Very quiet and with benches and stone tables to eat. 15 minutes walk from the town center. Be careful not to miss the ticket! The town has very narrow streets that are difficult for motorhomes to get out of!"
12848,1759254,5,Waild-Fahmuhlee,18/02/2022,"I'm giving 5 stars because this is a free spot in an absolutely gorgeous Town....
This is our first night in Spain and I get the feeling that park4night free spots are going to be very busy as there are maybe 10 other campers here...
the services work, but it's a shame that the water isnt free like it is in so many of our previous stays.."
12848,1743762,4,Miguel.AFuentes,29/01/2022,"Good area, it's full today. Perhaps if people would be more generous and the Campers would occupy the shortest spaces, the AC would not have to park so badly."
12848,1743640,5,yolioseja,29/01/2022,"We came and it was full. We have left it in the 5 meter squares. At 20:00 the police passed by and they told us that there was a hole and we should put it there. Another AC whose owners were not there has been fined. Otherwise, the area is very good, close to the center. The vans park in the places reserved for motorhomes when they have 5 m squares in front where they can leave them."

12848,1687249,3,Alozanom,13/11/2021,"Good place to fill / empty waters. The tokens, to fill water, have to be purchased at the Tourist Office (during their business hours). The parking lot is quite close to the town. Although there is another paquing, further away and in front of the ideal beach to spend the night."
12848,1657420,4,marpaufel,22/10/2021,Good area and magnificent town. Thanks. Only one area for emptying and filling is missing.
12848,1640523,2,Gemmy,12/10/2021,"The local police issue fines without criteria. We were parked in the smallest car parks with a limit of 5m, we did not go out and they gave us a fine. Other caravans, in the same place and with the chocks in the street, no fine. You have to go find the water file at the tourist office. The site has pending. Otherwise, all good."

12848,1638931,3,ernestofernandez,11/10/2021,"The site is fine. Wider than others, an ooco of unevenness. The bad thing is that to get drinking water you need a tourist card and the office was closed because it was Sunday. It seems fatal to me about the file ... if they demand it to open more hours at the tourist office. If I go without children I would have gone to Bermeo. There everything free and available."
12848,1632017,4,flo1310,07/10/2021,"The parking lot was full of RVs at the end of September. We were able to spend the night with our van in a normal parking lot without any problems. In the morning, locals park here and it gets a little louder. Unfortunately there are no sanitary facilities. However, you can drive / walk into the city, there are public toilets"
12848,1626903,5,chikispoon,04/10/2021,Perfect to sleep! Very close to the center! Recommendable! It fills up fast!

12848,1575801,3,anaisma,13/09/2021,"Very few places where motorhomes can fit and there are also vehicles of less than 5 meters occupying the only places that can park the motorhomes. In the center there is a sign for only vehicles of less than 5 meters, if they park there, the motorhomes would not have to leave because they could not find a place. In addition to 5 unused parking spaces due to construction work, it can be seen that they are installed and not moving until September."
12848,1569216,3,soniaclimatecba,11/09/2021,"They should study converting more places for motorhomes, since arriving on Saturday at noon, there were people waiting to park if there were places for cars, being that by car, you can park in the center"
12848,1559820,5,pauliky8,08/09/2021,We go on to empty. Fill is € 3. Very good to be able to visit the town since it is quite close. Somewhat uneven. It was full of AC (and vehicles of more than 5m that have fixed seats) for the day and it is not high season so I do not know how it will be in August ...
12848,1535457,4,ManjiRonin,31/08/2021,"Highly recommended area. the squares are not level. very close to the town but a group of young people were making a bottle nearby until the wee hours of the morning, they didn't let us rest too much. If it weren't for that I would give it 5 stars."
12848,1534553,5,triguerovilanova,31/08/2021,"Thanks to the town hall, good area, well located, it hurts that it fills up quickly. It is worth visiting the streets of this beautiful town and strolling to its lighthouse. When it's full you can park in the parking lot above, I think number 4. We were three parked today."
12848,1523382,2,Esprimwel,28/08/2021,"Good location but in high season it is very small. Ten spaces for vehicles of more than five meters, the rest of the parking is specified for vehicles of less than five meters. In August it is impossible to park. Ugly detail of several small campers occupying places of large vehicles having space of less than five meters. We will be back in low season ..."
12848,1510868,4,VitoL,25/08/2021,"Very close to the beach and the town, even in August it was almost impossible to park, luckily we found a space for the AC. Quiet place and with stone picnic tables, you have to go through the information point of the town to get a coin to recharge water € 3, 100 liters. free drainage of gray and black water."
12848,1508073,4,domtati56,24/08/2021,Very good for visiting the city.
12848,1506992,1,supermerche,24/08/2021,We come from Zumaia to find a place to stop to eat in the shade. It's being a bit difficult. We ended up in the bus parking lot because the one for motorhomes was full. We have stopped to eat and we are leaving. The area in the photo was very crowded. Very little space for motorhomes. We follow the path
12848,1502925,4,ineye,23/08/2021,Close to the town. Is beautiful. I recommend you go up to the island at low tide. Spectacular views. The night was very well and calm.
12848,1485516,5,trigolimpio,20/08/2021,"Good place to sleep, but if you find a place, give thanks, since being free, people spend their entire vacations there. Town and beach very close, at the entrance to the beach, under a beach bar there are free hyper-clean public toilets, apart from a beach wheelchair service for people with reduced mobility who can enjoy a good bath (bravo lequeitio)"
12848,1482029,1,logan_1976,19/08/2021,"In the morning we find a place. It can be emptied, but to fill you need ""jetones"" they are bought at the tourist office. Inside a parking lot marked with the prohibition of parking trucks of more than 5 meters, we saw a policeman denounce a van (M1, like passenger cars) 6 meters and leave other industrial vans and VW California without reporting despite exceeding 5 meters."
12848,1468648,4,skuderonow,16/08/2021,"Good area in a highly recommended location, five minutes from downtown and the beach, very crowded in high season in the early afternoon there is usually a free place, starting at seven / eight in the afternoon or try it in summer. Uneven squares, chocks can be used. Free water discharge, water recharge € 3, in the rest of the parking vehicles over 5 meters fine by the police."
12848,1464389,5,duca28,16/08/2021,very well located area near the town 5mnt recommended
12848,1464233,5,txellijoel,16/08/2021,We arrived around 9:00 pm in the middle of August and there was one of the enabled squares left. It is the only car park enabled to spend the night in Lekeitio. very calm! i near the town and beach.

12848,1415613,1,RaquelArimany,06/08/2021,"Motorhome parking that fills up fast. There is no option to park AC in the village. A pity. It is also not worth it to use services, the water is paid for and you need a 3 euro coin ticket which you have to pick up 10 minutes from the car park at the tourist office. Better to go to the village gas station where you can fill up with water for free. Quite nonsense."
12848,1413637,4,Asu5711,06/08/2021,"A good and quiet parking lot for one night as a starting point for exploring the place and a walk to the beach. everything within walking distance. It was very quiet at night and we slept well. there are a few tables and benches, fresh water. when we arrived in the early afternoon it was already very full, but we got a seat. we would come back here again."
12848,1407806,3,Oliviercecile,05/08/2021,"Very good to spend a day. Beach, port and town center very close on foot. Please note, the police ensure that campsites park only in the spaces provided for this purpose. In the evening, it is difficult to find a place in high season ..."
12848,1400446,5,vilanova,03/08/2021,"Good area, although you have to pay to refuel water and look for the card at the tourist office. Next to the town, very close to the beach, port and Magic Island, all of which is beautiful. We have eaten in the last restaurant on the promenade, in front of the port and it has delicious and fresh fish."

12848,1304887,2,JDomel210621,08/07/2021,We stayed here for one night it's hard to get a seat. Probably even more difficult in the main season. The city is very beautiful and the island is worth seeing.

It takes about 10 minutes to walk to the center. Be careful because we went into the town to see if we could find another parking lot and you have to go to the end to be able to make a U-turn, I recommend leaving it here and walking down to the town."

12941,894087,5,leptikmion,24/07/2020,"Guarded car park day and night. So difficult to park in Seville, we had left our vehicle 2 nights in the street but we had a window broken so we preferred to pay for the rest of the stay but be quiet."
12941,747003,5,Captvan,25/11/2019,Great for the city visit. Absolutely safe and many womos even in winter. Friendly staff. Best place in Seville.
12941,532231,1,famdamgo,29/06/2019,Super noisy traffic with no shadow guarded 24 hours but 19.50 per night or in a first class camping is worth a shame ke is the best wasteland ke and in Seville to spend the night with the car the same should evolve in tourism
12941,459161,4,brabar,19/04/2019,"Noisy by traffic, but guarded and safe. A few meters from bus stop that connects with the center in 10 minutes, or mushrooms. Wide frequency of bus line. Walking is 25 minutes from downtown. The drawback is that it has no service."
12941,458623,3,phoebegg,18/04/2019,"For us this seems to be the only parking in central Sevilla.. driving around the centre was a nightmare and they really don’t seem to be very courteous towards motorhomers. But the reception here was very friendly, and we would stay again. Didn’t stay overnight but we would do in the future because we love the city. No facilities."
12941,411166,3,Dan-el,01/12/2018,Really expensive for what it is. It is a guarded outdoor parking (I did not see anyone). It is a parking lot with a lot of movement so if you want tranquility it is not your place but you can sleep without problems. It is next to the train station (there are toilets) and about 30min from the center. It does not offer any service or water or electricity but at least the area is safe and I had no problem
12941,394604,3,meditador,17/10/2018,"It is basically a bus parking or very short stays (€ 1.25 / hour). Pass as a place where you can leave the car or sleep safely, but it is too expensive to charge € 19.50 for being more than 10 hours and not offer any service, not even a bathroom. For those who have a light sleep is not recommended because there is traffic and noise around. I spent one night arriving in Seville (10/15/2018) and it was almost empty and we were comfortable, taking advantage of the place to leave the dog loose in the enclosure, without the danger of it leaving."
12941,387336,1,Janosroadscout,04/10/2018,"It is too noisy to sleep in this place, never again. and the price to high 19,50€"
12941,225266,3,martincr,01/03/2018,"Good comunicated. Shopping center 10 minutes away, next to the suburbs and 20 minutes on foot from the city center. Something noisy at night due to traffic but you can sleep."

12994,3172146,4,mercedessantos,18/08/2023,"We stayed in a very spacious place. We paid 37€ with electricity. We found it a little pricey. The bathrooms could be bigger, they only have 2 toilets and 3 showers and some are damaged. At night around 1 am our “neighbors” were joking around and making a lot of noise laughing very loudly it even seemed on purpose, we went to draw attention and they still laughed. Fortunately, the gentleman who makes the rounds of the campsite caught our attention and ended up there. Unfortunately, the lack of respect has nothing to do with the camping, but with the people who stay there. Very friendly receptionist too."
12994,3114339,3,Partner2023,10/08/2023,"Park not very big. Lots of people crowded together and very noisy. Much lack of cleanliness in the WC (bathroom). At the price paid, it should have more conditions."
12994,2846995,3,Atreyukit,12/06/2023,"average camping, pool not very big. We wanted to leave late at night and the guard scolded us that it was not possible to leave with the car at that time, that when we arrived they explained it to us in detail that nobody told us anything. Luckily he opened the door for us and we were able to get out."

12994,2133875,3,looxon,28/07/2022,Poor pool. Poor access to a poor beach. A good starting point for Malaga.
12994,2104606,3,Dags82,22/07/2022,"Pool is too croudy, too small and mostly too deep. Almost not usable. Access to the beach via smelly tunnel under the road. From good things: it has good communication to beautyfull Malaga city by bus. Gym and table tennis in place. Helpful Staff."
12994,2020956,2,jbo777,29/06/2022,"The most expensive place so far on our 5 week trip. 90€ for 2 days in camper. Place is usable and okay, but not to clean or serviced. Pleasent people though."
12994,1970273,3,Miropana,12/06/2022,"The plots are spacious and level and the toilets are quite clean and the negative would be the store, which is non-existent and the beach, to say that access is terrible and you have 100 meters of beach being generous"
12994,1964338,3,Louandnova,10/06/2022,"All the other camping areas were full, so we came here, £22. Very good facilities, free WiFi and lovely pool, but not very welcoming and no information given about the campsite. They didn’t appear happy we hadn’t booked and only staying one night."

Bar and restaurant Cool swimming pool in April we cross the road to be at the beach but gray black sand. Near Torre del mar. you need at least a scooter to be able to move. However, that's just my opinion. but hey...nothing attractive."
12994,1823748,5,chanchan68210,15/04/2022,"super campsite, rather family quiet near Torre del Mar and Benajarafe bus next to the campsite a means of transport allows to visit the surroundings and there is something to do very friendly staff attentive to customers we had to stay a month finally stayed 2 months fresh bread, restaurant, washing machine and dryer thanks to all the equipment supplier"

Clean sanitary facilities with really hot showers. We paid 22€ per night with AC. Only wanted to stay 2 - then became 4. Nice staff - nice pitches. Great - we'd love to come back!"

12994,1706319,3,ivoderooij,08/12/2021,A small and fairly cramped campsite on the coast. it is a bit out of the way and it is quite a bike ride to Torre del Mar. Friendly management and a nice atmosphere. bit noisy Spanish fellow tourists but that's no different.
12994,1698496,4,aktiveangelika,26/11/2021,"Very nice place. Small playground for the children, that's always important to us. Washer and dryer available and work well. New toilets and very hot showers have been added. This is our second time here and can only recommend it. We paid 25 € / night per night for the mobile home and 2 adults plus two small children, plus dog and electricity. Washing machine 5 € and dryer 3 € / wash with dryer. Very nice service staff."
12994,1696847,2,mamidream,24/11/2021,"Apparently everything looks good on this campsite, wifi 4 bars everywhere! except that you are well connected to the box but the box is connected to a prehistoric internet which cuts without stopping and without flow! Very clean toilets but lukewarm water when you're lucky if not freezing. one night will be enough!"

12994,1573327,3,LouisAlex,12/09/2021,We can't really think of anything to complain about; there were many children in the square who were awake very late at night and making noise.
12994,1490162,4,EM15,21/08/2021,"Very friendly, quiet and the restaurant of the best. Access to the beach is its weak point, for that reason and for having to use a vehicle to get around I do not give it 5 Stars. Good cleanliness and pool."
12994,1334826,3,chinchinatorr,18/07/2021,Clean bathrooms and friendly staff but the pool water was very dirty. It was Friday and we didn't like the atmosphere very much. The people in the restaurant are very friendly and with good food and good prices.

12994,877429,3,sunrolleraloha93,18/07/2020,"Well priced in high season. The best thing about the campsite was the temperature of the pool and the restaurant, I did not like the access to the beach because it is a seedy staircase, I imagine it is not the fault of the campsite but of the town hall. They do not have a supermarket, which always does very well."
12994,848715,5,ChrisT771,04/07/2020,"Nice reception. Everything including gym and physiotherapy available. In comparison, quite large plots. Location on the street but quiet at night. Completed restaurant very good."
12994,792331,3,niklasmarie,07/03/2020,Clean and good equipped camping space. In March we paid 27€/night for a medium sized pitch. Toilets and showers perfectly clean. You’re neck to neck with other campers and the surroundings aren’t that beautiful. Staff was helpful and friendly. WiFi was very bad
12994,783509,4,sam.simon,20/02/2020,Nice location facing the sea.

12994,292976,3,carlcort,18/07/2018,Good installations. Pool something small but clean. The bar is great but the owner is always fighting with his daughter giving an embarrassing show and leaving the customers unattended. A shame.
12994,261968,4,lethillotin,01/06/2018,We can just do the services for 6 €. What we did because the petrol station Cepsa 4 km do not accept us anymore.

12994,141206,3,polonaise62,06/06/2017,Campervan pitches spacious and delimited with sun protection cloth. On the other hand the sanitary of the top would need a facelift. Bus at the exit of the campsite for Malaga about 45 minutes to 1 hour to reach Malaga. Not worth the € 19 with ACSI given its location. Beach at the exit of the campsite not terrible. Limit home

12994,73994,1,sphinx1978,20/05/2016,"Sanitary not very clean, no hot water to wash in women, one sink on 4 that works properly in women. Wifi fee but does not work. At the edge of a national road a lot of noise, not very wide locations and no separation between plots. And finally it's very expensive for what it is. 22 € for 2 people a night and a van. We knew a lot better for a lot less money."

13004,2466558,5,Joeelindio,28/10/2022,They have treated us very well and the economic price for the services it offers. You can also empty the tanks without the need for an overnight stay.
13004,2380207,1,Laraine,17/09/2022,"We have been visiting for 8/9years, have loved the site and the welcome. Will NEVER return, booked 2 nights, did not stay even 1. It has become a shanty town, for long term people with no where else to stay relying on scavenging bins to make a living.  It is no longer and Aire to stand and feel safe in. We are very sad by the change. 
for 5euro more recommend Camping Bahia, safe and welcoming."

They have not wanted to refund the amount of the second night."

Away from the town, in an industrial zone, without great pretensions but that does the trick to stop, rest, take a shower and empty. The women's restrooms were undergoing renovations, but they are small, as is the area itself. Full area for long-stay places, with few places in rotation."
13004,1768931,5,ljp24,28/02/2022,Small nice simple unpretentious area nice owner 2 steps from the city 10€ 3€ for services

13004,1752325,3,Marianne49,10/02/2022,"The first time we visited the campsite. It cost 11 euros without electricity, but with shower and toilet. The campsite is located in an industrial area but here was quiet and peaceful at night. There was a howling sound from the factory that was heard when it was quiet. There was also a very good wifi and a nice owner."
13004,1750768,4,Sissi22,08/02/2022,We are loyal to this area which is located in the middle of an industrial zone. Welcoming manager who improves the pitches. continue

13004,1746642,2,rausreisen,03/02/2022,"Waste water 2€, fill water 3€, shower per person 3€ - showers weren't even lukewarm and really not worth the money. The place itself is really not inviting and in the middle of an industrial area. Staying here is worth nothing by itself. For the supply as an exception ok. We would not come again."
13004,1742742,3,povilas393,28/01/2022,Only used services for 5 euros. Pretty expensive. Site does not look very nice.
13004,1736519,1,Burgwasser,18/01/2022,"Visiting a parking space in the industrial area has a lot to do with indifference. If you don't value anything, then you've come to the right place. Only the disposal station alone is positive in this place."
13004,1735057,3,deniseentim,16/01/2022,"We are passing through and for us it was ideal to use the facilities (grey/black). We were even allowed to use the showers for a fee. Don't expect luxury, but it is clean and the owner friendly. We'll remember it for next time we're in the area. Thank you!"
13004,1717316,3,JulianA70,28/12/2021,"It is an area of land in the middle of the polygon, truck noise at 8, no shade, you have to level, only services € 5, sleep and services € 10, light € 3, for one night and correct emptying"
13004,1706948,4,audreycalys,09/12/2021,"The place has everything you need, is clean and maintained even if the sanitary facilities are dilapidated, it is clean, the people are very friendly. The only problem is the cold rooms of the buildings next door which make noise all night long, so if you are sensitive to it, do not go to the pool side. To leave for 11am. Town center 2 km, zoo 3 km"
13004,1699517,4,WillWessel,28/11/2021,"Perfect campsite, everything is there, nice and quiet, good for charging and filling everything. very helpful owner. definitely come back when I'm in the area again. The price is acceptable €13. all inclusive."

13004,1650584,2,ridu,18/10/2021,Bit of a sad event. Sanitary is simple but clean. Owner is nice. Many cats on the camper place. Is an industrial area.
13004,1577987,5,Tarque,14/09/2021,"I have only filled and emptied water and toilet, but everything has gone great. They were not present but I called the phone, I was able to make the payment by bizum (there is a mailbox for payment in cash) and without problems."

13004,1203692,5,Pinchapeses,17/05/2021,"Ideal place for waste and water change. Perfect price, € 2 emptying the water and € 3 loading the water. Easy maneuvering, fast and friendly service. Hopefully more places like this. To spend the night a little tricky and secluded, but for gray water service and to fill up luxury water."
13004,1191416,3,Bobby79,10/05/2021,"The place is not nice. But V / E is good. Unfortunately, it's very difficult here in the region. However, I would say max 8m vehicles. It's very tight. Many permanent campers. Directly adjacent to an industrial area. For the location, 10 euros for an overnight stay is really too much."
13004,1171409,3,Francis2408,10/04/2021,"We were only there to dispose of gray / black water and fill up with fresh water. For 5 € everything was great, right at the entrance, easily accessible and clean. Payment is made directly at the entrance at the reception, if no one is there, there is a mailbox where the money can be dropped. The space itself is not nice, wouldn't stay here, but recommended for the service only."
13004,1152860,1,chekebo,17/03/2021,Too far from the city of Santa Pola. The area looks a bit run down. It seems abusive to me to charge € 2 just for emptying the gray ones. As we enter we leave

It's a bit louder on weekdays. € 10 € 3 electricity. the wifi is free and works properly. There are no shades, although in winter it is not a problem. Only payment in cash, cards are not accepted. You can only use the emptying of water (€ 3) and filling with drinking water (€ 2)"
13004,1115651,1,kmfrank,16/11/2020,"The VE is difficult to achieve for larger mobiles. VE costs 5 €. Flushing the disposal system clean with well water costs € 2 extra. At my protest, the operator threw a toilet brush against the window of the motorhome twice. The parking space is in an industrial area, you look at a scrap and disposal site."

13004,282315,1,borjasl,07/07/2018,"Despite being very few people in the area, WC services leave much to be desired. Not clean, cold water in the showers ... Constant noise from a nearby frozen company. The area is not well leveled and you have to use shims. Just to spend the night if you want 220V."
13004,236590,4,SantiScalza,14/04/2018,"Very good area, has everything you need for a long stay. The manager very attentive. The only downside is that the location within an industrial estate."

13004,230905,3,minivantravel,30/03/2018,"Very clean and quiet place. Friendliness on the part of the staff. It has bakery service. About 2 kilometers from the beach. Quality and great price. The negative points are that the toilet and shower services could be somewhat better and also the location is in an industrial estate a little out of town, but sleeping is not bad."
13004,229269,5,penny13,24/03/2018,The comment about do not use and the reported incident is one sided. The gentleman was seen on cctv hitting the light and one witness saw it. This is a very well run clean and tidy Aire

13004,212779,1,ourmotorhome,26/11/2017,Do not use this place. We stayed one night and the owner charged us 85€ for damage to a light we didn't cause. If we didn't pay he said he would call the police and we'd have to pay for an interpreter anyway. This was so upsetting. Please do not give this guy any more money as he doesn't deserve it.

See pic of car park with arrow as to location of (free) escalators to city centre. Entrance see pic ~300m. Tourist bracelet €10 to get in a few places but not the cathedral who wants you to buy another ticket (deserves a Grrrr IMO)."
13009,1473634,3,mferame,17/08/2021,"Camping is prohibited, so the worst thing is not being able to open casement windows in the heat of the heat. If it had services it would be ideal to visit the city, it is less than 200 meters from the escalators that place you in Plaza Zocodover."

The car park is mostly occupied by the cars of the inhabitants of Toledo during the day, so it is quite busy but from 19h there is easily space. Attention, there are no pitches reserved for motorhomes, so a 7,50m occupied 4 cars places! The best is to regroup at the bottom of the parking lot so as not to disturb too much.

There is a garden with the river Tagus and that is excellent for those who take friends with four legs. It is very close to the escalators of access to the city.

13016,2666610,4,Awen,13/04/2023,"We went there yesterday but could not stay, place not suitable for our 12m converted coach. Located in the heart of the city, access is a little difficult due to residents who are very poorly parked around the site. Nevertheless we walked around there, a lot of people but still a few places. Nice place to visit Tomar. The Happy Duduls"
13016,2651562,5,Moreva,08/04/2023,Great to visit Tomar. In the square there is a super cool Templario restaurant for dinner but you have to book the day before.
13016,2647994,5,txampe,07/04/2023,"Unused campsite left RV parking. Exceptional site two steps from the town of Tomar as well as the river area.

13016,2638104,4,Adventurier,03/04/2023,Great for visiting Tomar and its castle. Thanks to the city. A great merit to exist. Clean because lots of trash cans available. The only damage neither drains nor water but well done all the same.
13016,2621567,5,ayoinviaggio,23/03/2023,"Thanks Tomar. It is a very quiet and central place. It can be seen that it is an abandoned campsite, but the fact remains that it is still functional for its purpose: To welcome tourists worthily in a clean and silent area. Several technicians from the municipality were present today to make surveys, so it is probable that there will be work shortly."
13016,2619727,4,janvan75,22/03/2023,"still a nice place, free water and waste, cold showers .. annoying are the campers who let their dogs run loose, let them do their business and do not clean up anything .. is now starting to get warm, stench and flies .. a part has been cordoned off because of scouting they are allowed in the .... camping later."
13016,2617320,4,Almanat,20/03/2023,"We spent one night in this former campsite, everything was quiet except for the dogs. The city and the sights were worth seeing. Super good,*****, was the service and the food at Dom Bacalhau, Fabrica da Fiacao 4. One star less because the service from the place was moderate, no drinking water and no showers."
13016,2615789,4,cariste85,19/03/2023,thank you for the area and the services .. we stayed 2. days only happiness

13016,2602685,5,Marani,08/03/2023,"A very nice place in a beautiful city. However, it is a pity that the place is so neglected. The reception seems to be deserted from one moment to the next. Even at this time of year the place was well occupied. The town and the Convento is well worth a visit."
13016,2598900,5,Lman,05/03/2023,All services. Quiet space away from town which is very close by.
13016,2596810,4,ISALU7,03/03/2023,"Free area, with fully functional services. Quiet and very close to the centre, which is definitely worth a visit. For those who have dogs, be careful because it is full of cats."
13016,2595252,3,ElVeterano,01/03/2023,"OK for one night, but a very run down and scruffy former municipal campsite, I really wouldn't want to stay longer. But everything is here, it is quiet at night and very close to the town. The service point is on the left of the gates as you are leaving. Free Wi-Fi but it only works if you are close to the entrance. Thank you to Tomar."
13016,2593757,4,AdelinoCosta,28/02/2023,"ASA with all the conditions, electric light, all free, but it is as a resident for some motorhomes, which open awnings, and occupy two places, with motorhomes for 2 years in the same place. when you arrive, everything is occupied by residents, which for them is a free campsite, it's a pity there is no municipal control"
13016,2585171,5,___Teox___,20/02/2023,Everything perfect thanks to the municipality for all the free services! There is also wifi! It was really good!!! The city center is close! It will be 200/300 meters. We will be back!

13016,2577071,4,Olli85,13/02/2023,fully ok for the night. And the convention is really worth seeing. Only the old town is extinct. So much vacancy. A pity. Many thanks to the city for this pleasant and quiet place and the supply even with a bakery.

13016,2566799,4,Carloscalvoconde,02/02/2023,"A most unique municipal campsite that was abandoned about ten years ago but is reasonably well preserved. Without showers or toilets or electricity, but it does have a change of gray and black water. Very central and quiet. The city is charming with its Templar castle (it was closed due to the wind). It is recommended to have lunch in the old medieval tavern, in the Republic Square."
13016,2566777,4,Ella-B.,02/02/2023,We spent a quiet night here and will definitely be back. It is a pity that the campsite is no longer run by the city. Here every camper is asked to leave the site properly so that it can be used for a long time and does not degenerate into a landfill or dog toilet. The cats are happy about a treat.
13016,2556748,5,Maisey,21/01/2023,excellent place to stay . very friendly. wonderful bread at 9.30 . in the middle of a city.

Pure nature Close to the city what more could you ask for. PS You can take your rubbish to the front in the big containers, then you won't have to write such negative reviews. (Marauder) JB"

13016,2491315,2,Tellus29,11/11/2022,"The place was given up by the municipality, but V/E is still possible. In the morning, an older man comes to collect the garbage bags, the containers are next to the only tap that is still open. Only for toilet! An itinerant trader comes in the morning with a loud honk, probably a baker. The beautiful old town can be reached directly from the gate to the right through the park."
13016,2486189,4,CasitaNL,07/11/2022,"Everything you need. A place for your camper, a place to empty your toilet and a waste container. Washing machines nearby, Lidl within walking distance.

13016,2476948,4,Thisis_vanlife,01/11/2022,An old campsite used as a free Aire for the city of Tomar. Lots of space if everyone parks well. A strange place though - it’s abandoned and run down looking. It could do with a little TLC just to keep on top of the greenery/grounds but a great park up to visit and explore this wonderful city. Water available but couldn’t see any waste dump area.
13016,2464060,4,fabder31,26/10/2022,Old campsite with lots of places if everyone makes an effort for everyone there. Very very quiet. Services. Trays for cold water dishes. Bins and sorting bins.

13016,2437153,5,montravels,11/10/2022,"Very cool place. Quiet and with lots of shade. The ratio is the same as in a standard campsite only without camping management. I was only there during the day, two days ago. I would like to stay there too. No toilets but water, sink and garbage disposal."
13016,2436957,5,JoseEduardoTeixeira,11/10/2022,"The Municipality of Tomar is to be congratulated for motorhomes. The most beautiful, calm and well-situated campervan site I know, along with Alcobaça. Thank you Tomar."
13016,2436605,3,Luc1112,11/10/2022,"Large space for all types of CCs. You have a lot of choice of shade or sun places. The place has a high sense of security and is probably the perfect place to look at the city. Negatives: - toilet was closed - shower not found - there is always a smelly smell - everything seems a bit run down For one night, however, great"
13016,2433458,5,Barcobird,09/10/2022,visited Tomar many times finding it one of our favourites in Portugal. looks a little run down but has all facilities and is very popular. the town is beautiful with the river running through its heart and the castle overlooking everything. It has many restaurants and coffee  bars. It is also a perfect place in which to explore on two wheels with many places of interest within 20-30 kilometres.

At the fourth location, campers arrived again at 1:20 am and set up their knick-knacks. An impudence. Worst place in a long time."

It would be nice if the city would take care of it a little, at least empty the garbage cans and cut the grass, and charge a few euros for space/parking. Only by a barrier eg. like in a parking lot. Anyone would be happy to pay for that."
13016,1946966,5,jomagosi,04/06/2022,"One of the best campervan parks I've ever visited, very quiet with services and shade and on top of that it's free. thanks to the city to take it for welcoming us with open arms."
13016,1942365,4,stephanie1392,03/06/2022,"Motorhome parking ideal for visiting the city, the center is right next door. There are places in the shade possible. The residents and the lack of maintenance of the vegetation may not seem reassuring on arrival. We didn't spend the night there, we just visited the city."

I am ashamed of the sometimes outrageous comments of my compatriots. The ""travelling people"" are charming older Portuguese gentlemen. Please remember everyone, we are guests here and should gratefully accept a gift like this."
13016,1921353,4,voyage18520,27/05/2022,"very good to spend a few nights. space of choice in the sun or in the shade, clean and close to the city. Thanks Tomar"

13016,1908496,3,sanneboompje,22/05/2022,"People STOP peeing or throwing toilets into bushes or plots or sinks or the potable water fountain..there even is a special 'emptying toilet spot'! PLEASE start to care about other people instead of only yourselves!
Other than that and the 'too many people', could be a great place absolutely and superb that Tomar provides this! Always the people who destroy the peace&quiet and proper environment!"

13016,1873351,5,HectorHoose,06/05/2022,"Superb! Very popular for obvious reasons, the site is still pretty with mature trees & hedging plus grass. As long as you only need water & disposal it’s great as they still function plus there are sinks to do dishes & laundry (cold water only). Daily bread van too. Site is 2 mins walk to the river & then town centre. The UNESCO world heritage site of the Convent is 15 mins walk & is stunning. You can walk the castle walls too."
13016,1871747,5,SaRon110819,05/05/2022,"Super nice free parking space with supply and disposal. It's also very central, so it's only a few minutes' walk into town. The pitch was pretty full, but you can still find a spot somewhere. Really nice atmosphere."
13016,1860536,5,Kerseboom,29/04/2022,"A special place, indeed an old campsite, which gives a somewhat unsavory first impression. But a free, shady place, quiet place in the middle of the center, really top."
13016,1857608,4,Roel964,28/04/2022,"You are in the middle of the city, but you have the feeling that you are on a campsite in the middle of nature. Perfect! The baker comes by at 9.45 am."

13016,1852873,3,manuejack,25/04/2022,"has the merit of existing, is it's great. Once the improvements are made it will be paid, if it is reasonable OK, we will come back. the city is superb and the castle is worth the detour."

13016,1808307,5,biquet5155,06/04/2022,"Tomar is a pleasant city, with a human dimension. Town center 2 steps away. All trade on site. Magnificent castle and convent to visit. The area is a former campsite with all services, except electricity. Very quiet. The baker comes every morning at 10 am. .But this will not prevent us from returning."
13016,1796021,3,ventures,26/03/2022,"Tomar always a good step. Unfortunately the area is no longer maintained. Dead trees are not cut and surrounded by tape, which eliminates about 20 places. A previous comment indicates that it is difficult for large motorhomes and trailers. This is our case and no problem. We are next to a football field and huge buses take the same route."
13016,1794616,5,Gilles1383,25/03/2022,"Absolutely calm, it's rather rare for parking lots offered in town, good services, the baker comes by around 10:00 am. Too bad that visits to the castle are not possible on weekdays and out of season."

Water and Chemical disposal available,  I wouldn’t use the hand wash laundry area.  Fantastic for a night, to pay a visit to the Convent of Christ which is impressive.  My SatNav took me round a final hairpin bend which would be no fun for a long vehicle or with a trailer. Peaceful Night."
13016,1791639,5,AnVie,22/03/2022,This free site is quiet and flat. peaceful night and emptying done. thanks to the city of Tomar

13016,1755477,3,BusslonTour,14/02/2022,"Hello everyone, we were in Tomar in October. Former campsite that offers everything except electricity. Supply and disposal for WoMo available. The local police visited the site twice a day. We felt really safe here. Many thanks here to Stadt Tomar. Anyone who claims otherwise is probably completely spoiled and should visit paid places and then"
13016,1752820,2,Prorom,11/02/2022,"lost place VE right at the entrance. Some rooms currently Covid test center. Toilets out of order. Everything else run down and dirty. No care recognizable. Beautiful terrain - but: a rocked campsite should just about be good enough for us?! sorry Other communities that take tourism seriously do this better. Nevertheless we stayed, better than nothing."
13016,1749738,5,mafquim,07/02/2022,"Safe, quiet and clean place. An authentic refuge for motorhomes who feel ostracized elsewhere. Close to the center, the market and local shops. Very nice people. Fresh bread in the morning including on the weekend. 3 wonderful days and the weather helped. Well done to the municipality for maintaining the infrastructure and fostering motorhomes."
13016,1743175,4,MitMichel,29/01/2022,"We stood here very quietly for three days, lots of space, the baker comes in the morning, close to the center."
13016,1742909,5,Wally2020,28/01/2022,"What a nice quiet place. We slept here several nights. There is 1 place for black, gray and clean water. There is also a water tap at the former toilets, but that water is not completely transparent. There are plenty of spacious places available. At the weekend it is slightly busier with campers. Walking distance to the old town and park."
13016,1731789,3,Rli,10/01/2022,"Very good, even if abandoned ... There is water and the drain ... no electricity. the grass is not mowed and the toilets not in use are gloomy .... worthy of a Hitchcock This campsite therefore does not require covid tests, but the last thing is that they do them on site: it is now a covid test center."
13016,1728915,1,phoenixrider,07/01/2022,"The place is occupied by traveling people, littered and neglected. Ok for one night. But not recommended."
13016,1722219,4,BiermannJupp,01/01/2022,"We were also here and everything you need is there except electricity. Everyone can take care of that themselves. Pure nature, close to the city, what more could you want. (Marauder) JB"
13016,1717476,4,Casemiro,28/12/2021,Great. Only the toilets closed. Complete cleaning station. There is no electricity. City WiFi ok. Quiet overnight.
13016,1709063,4,Hardy59,12/12/2021,"Very good place to get to know Tomar and his castle (! Wow). Space is getting old for it free of charge and in the middle of the city. Which community offers such a service? Supply a bit hidden but everything we campers need is available. Thank you very much, Tomar."
13016,1708142,3,Fontebandeira,11/12/2021,"Transit park for AC. Former camping site now municipal. Abandoned. Yellowish water (not drinkable?) Cannot be filled tank. Better that they fix it, some maintenance and charge a little for good services. Unbeatable location. Good grove. Everything disconnected (light, taps). Closed bathrooms and everything very run down."
13016,1701431,5,Alanouille,01/12/2021,"Free place is perfect, the outdoor showers are usable (cold water), the toilets are closed and there are sinks for washing dishes and laundry, there are water spots everywhere, the place is large , and it was very busy when we arrived (end of November). The streets are narrow enough to access the site, and to exit if the cars are badly parked it can prevent the passage of larger motorhomes / Van. Otherwise nothing to say! This place is perfect"
13016,1699935,5,travel_bnmr,29/11/2021,Great place in a lovely town. Only downside at this time of year that there are a lot of trees so watch where you put it otherwise you will be in the shade all day.
13016,1692720,5,ToInfinityAndBeyond,19/11/2021,"Amazing parking and service area!
Right in the middle of town. It's an amazing green and quiet area (it used to be a camping site), perfect to stay a few days to explore the city. Free water, grey and black disposal. Thanks to the municipality for providing this area."

13016,1690160,4,gyzmo35,15/11/2021,"Be careful to follow the signs for the camping area and not the GPS which confuses us towards too narrow streets. No electricity but all services. Good location in town. Unfortunately people squat places for a very long time, so there are few places available. This old campsite is poorly maintained but very practical for visiting the sanctuary which is magnificent."

13016,1684661,5,Sungaya,10/11/2021,"Great free campsite. Somewhat overgrown but illuminated. On the last kilometer, it is better to follow the signs instead of Google Maps (some roads are otherwise impassable with a camper because they are too narrow!)."

Great place made free for motorhomes in the centre of Tomar (which is beautiful and worth visiting). Lots of trees and leveled spots (though it was high season still had lots of parking space). Also great spots do dive by Nabão river.
Thanks Tomar's municipality!"

13016,1224715,4,Pipok,29/05/2021,"A good Free site with shade but currently no facilities except water & grey & black waste disposal. It was approx 40% full when we were there which is quite busy compared to other sites recently visited. A van still comes with fresh bread around 9:30am. Very easy walk to the town which is definitely worth a visit.  We got a Tuk Tuk to see some historical sites, very friendly lady but pretty expensive at €45 for 1 hour. It didn’t include the convent or the castle."
13016,1217694,5,BePe5861,25/05/2021,"Quiet place in the middle of the city. V / E and fresh water possible without any problems. The sanitary facilities were closed during our stay.

13016,1113140,5,Thenudrovers,07/11/2020,Very good spot.  We were there when there was a lot of rain so many vans were either running a generator or their engines.  No problem with dogs barking at night.
13016,1097976,5,Cheeky-Chaser,18/10/2020,"This is a fantastic site, as long as you don't need hook up. There is a woman who comes by every morning to sell fresh bread out of her van. The only real downside is the dog barking at night but it's not enough to mark it down from 5 stars. If you hear a horn at about 9am its her. I  definitely recommend this place as a place to spend a few days."
13016,1096950,4,PATRICIA_FILIPE,17/10/2020,"Excellent place to spend a few days, right in the city center. Quiet and serviced. Only electricity is missing. Without a doubt a place to return."

13016,1063193,5,Bideanbi,21/09/2020,"We spent a couple of nights there. It is a quiet and safe place. The land is a kind of meadow, with quite a few shadows (plots are not limited). It is located in the village itself. There are supermarkets nearby. We had a great time there. Having free sites like this is much appreciated."
13016,1045910,4,r4_f6,13/09/2020,"Former facilities pretty rocky, but nice atmosphere and sensational location. Toilets and showers currently closed, cold outdoor shower in operation."

Thank you Tomar we will be spending our eating out budget in town. its free, whats not to like ! 5 stars if you can stop that dog barking all night."
13016,1025773,5,c.agor,04/09/2020,"Place to spend a night, or two, or three. We discovered it by chance on the way to Coimbra and it is well worth a stop in Tomar. 10 place to camp at the old town campground. In addition, it is recommended to visit the town and the Convent of Christ (€ 6 adults). Nearby, there is also an aqueduct that can be traveled from end to end. Highly recommended the place. Thank you Tomar !!!"

13016,1009495,4,bluevanproject,28/08/2020,"Nice place but it could be better. It looks kind of abandoned. Didn’t use bathrooms so not sure if  there was baths or sinks available. Only stayed for one night. No electricity but water discharge available for free. Drinking water also. The location it’s perfect: next to the beautiful center. Tomar is a city full of life, you can definitely tell. Municipal pool a few steps away. Only when we left, in the morning, there was a man in the entrance gate, but he park is free and the gate is always open."
13016,1008851,4,DanielFernandez,28/08/2020,"The site is great, it is closed since it was an old town hall campsite, even during the day it has an employee. It has a lot of space, in August it is not saturated and the squares are quite flat and with trees. Message to the city council: charge something per day and put electricity, we would be happy to pay."

Suggestion to the city council: pay anything 5 or 10 euros and eliminate those needs. In addition it is right next to the municipal swimming pool where for 2 euros a person can spend the afternoon.

13016,906738,5,antoniofol,28/07/2020,"A marvel of initiative, that of converting an old camping site into a motorhome area. The site is great and very comfortable. Despite being free, it has maintenance and surveillance personnel from 8 in the morning to 6 in the afternoon. It is also a step away from the park, the municipal pool and the historic center. Do not miss a visit to the Templar castle."

(upper wash house) the toilets an impertinence. completely dirty.... since we were the only campers that day, unfortunately you can't attribute it to the guests...."

13017,891644,4,GipsyJeep,23/07/2020,Nice spot with a great landscape. No words to describe Gois village and the waters running inside! Awesome people and locals. No dogs aloud in the river beaches but it’s possible to get around it! Great camping spot. Shadowless on the upper floor.
13017,764610,4,BlueBirds,05/01/2020,Nice place and well located.

13017,265320,4,wortho,08/06/2018,Nice quiet camp right above the village. We were the only Campers tonight so very peaceful and just what we were looking for after being by the coast for several weeks. Village is small but very pretty and picturesque. You can empty toilets and fill with fresh water for €3. Cost for two in campervan €13.30 without electricity.

13072,3192796,3,Canela.,21/08/2023,"A lot of movement of people and cars day and night. It has a restaurant right next to it with delicious food, although dogs are not allowed (we ordered it to take away) and then on the main beach it is true that dogs are not allowed, but the one on the right is a paradise for chuchis."
13072,3183254,4,Hugal38,19/08/2023,"Very good location to spend a night with a van. Most: the incredible view, free beach shower nearby. Cons: the car park is not large, you are quickly crowded with other trucks."

13072,3014447,4,LaxeLL17,24/07/2023,"We landed a little further than the parking lot, facing the sea and the sunset. Quiet spot with magnificent views of the sea and the waves, lots of surf schools passing by in the morning"
13072,3007138,5,vinzsurprised,23/07/2023,Magnificent view!! Nearby beaches! No amenities. Inclined ground. The children enjoyed themselves. Calm nights lulled by the sound of the waves!

13072,2425436,4,BaraoAzul,05/10/2022,We stayed for one night. I slept like a log with the violent waves hitting the beach below us. Woke up to a magnificent view over the sea. We were three cars spending the night. Nice cafe for a morning coffee.
13072,2382710,4,fuchslauri,18/09/2022,We stayed 1 night. Great view. You can hear the sea rushing but not disturbing. Wedges recommended. Beach nearby with a delicious restaurant at the end of the beach (the next day we were allowed to use the beach toilets from the restaurant). No problems/police. Right next to tarmac road - not a long driveway but still not much noise. We would come again
13072,2177991,1,Joajarr,05/08/2022,"Nice spot, good and calme night,
in the morning realised that someone stole our portable step ladder, and my swimsuit surf.

Yes, lots of robbery around."
13072,1914758,1,vdubjd,25/05/2022,"seemed like a nice area, nice beach, good location and park up was ok.
we walked down to the beach bar for a few beers. 
On returning to the van, a man sneaked up on us when we where sat in the van, he appeared at the side door and tried to grab stuff from of the van.
We shouted enough to warn him off but we didn't feel safe so left quickly and moved on."
13072,1897289,4,mariajlsc50,18/05/2022,The place is spectacular as it has a wonderful view over the sea. When I arrived in the afternoon it was the only campervan but at night there were already 5 of us. You can only hear the sea.
13072,1834806,4,fine69,18/04/2022,nice parking lot with a great view. were here one night with about 5 other campers. It was very windy so the waves were very loud at night but otherwise it would have been calm.

A few minutes walk from a nice beach that you can drive to (we drove downstairs as soon as we woke up and had breakfast there, although I wouldn't park right on the beach at night)"
13072,1750118,4,ElsieCanizaresMota,07/02/2022,We stayed one night and it was really quiet. A spectacular view and we walked towards the beach to the end. Very beautiful and full of surfers. Recommendable. No services.

we left. to guincho, much better.

two stars instead of one because it might be better during another season or day time."
13072,202158,4,steffy-weijs,12/10/2017,"If we find the sites that are flat, beautiful place. Difficult to cross the village; but not impossible. No showers"
13072,154266,4,Johnelks,19/07/2017,Plenty of beach front parking in what appears to be free spaces. Not ideal for all campervan's but there are some spaces that run parallel to the beach and therefore are accessible. A few local bars restaurants shops and a really nice looking hotel are all useful. The beach itself is very picturesque with rolling waves and surfers
13072,154051,1,lolita.m,18/07/2017,Paid parking (officially) mid-July (5 €). So we went to the street of the hotel just before this one to go to free parking. The latter was very busy (mainly by surfers) early in the morning. The person who had planted his umbrella and his sign (first car park) left in the evening and returned the next day.
13072,91096,4,Rollo90,08/08/2016,Sand parking overlooking the beach from above. Room without problems when we went there in early August. A lot of wind.
