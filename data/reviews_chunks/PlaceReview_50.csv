102,3144982,3,Poloblue73,14/08/2023,We may have fallen in the wrong direction...music until 4:30 am in the restaurant! We forgot the bad night after a great swim/body board session in the waves in the morning.

102,2993303,4,COontheroad,20/07/2023,"very nice spot...the view, the sunset, the calm at night (it can happen late),...but...you need a little luck (or patience) to get a place in the flat part of the car park, there are a lot of people, the absence of toilets is unfortunately felt in the bushes given the people passing through here. Nevertheless a very nice place, we slept well and enjoyed the beautiful view."

102,2816234,5,CundAnt,03/06/2023,Brilliant place! Since we have a car <2 m we could park on the plateau with a great view. At night there were about 10 other campers there.

102,2660732,2,javitxu90,11/04/2023,"Car park that can fit vans, due to height limitation, next to the sandy beach. bins, and bins nearby. There is no highly rated source, and it fills up very quickly. There are flat squares and others where it is impossible to spend the night because of the slope. when we were, it's super dirty. Abandoned restaurant next door that gives a very bad vibe. It is very exposed to the air, and the noise of the waves is heard a lot."

102,2336756,5,uroyo,04/09/2022,Incredible area to spend the night! Very quiet and with a super good rollero atmosphere. Views and access to the beach in front of a terrace to have a drink. We have been several times and it is without a doubt a place of ten to disconnect and be between sea and mountains.
102,2310203,5,montanaperdida,27/08/2022,"Quiet night with wonderful views! At night there are many gaps, which are not all level! The views are beautiful, as well as having the beach next to you to enjoy (there is a shower)! Beware of leaving food unattended, RATS are on the prowl!"
102,2308218,5,froglegeater,27/08/2022,"A little piece of paradise, wonderful area, great lagoons for swimming, 3 restaurants nearby, busy place but rather quiet at night. Police came by in the morning and and took photos of the vans who had set up outside camping equipment. Apart from that, they confirmed it's ok to sleep here. City services come too in the morning to pick up garbage, please keep this wonderful place clean"

102,2183206,3,Meloch09,06/08/2022,"We have just spent the night there, very nice view when we wake up, many people spend the night there but very quiet. On the other hand, a very bad smell of urine..."

102,1941812,4,silviaapec,03/06/2022,"very quiet place! at least during the week... very clear waters, perfect for watching the sunset. We have not had any problems sleeping (we were 4 vans) all great! but there are quite a few rats... be careful with the garbage!"

102,1491944,4,Aurke,21/08/2021,"It is a place that is great to sleep with a minicamper, or camper. 2m height barrier. Very quiet night, but you have to come in the late afternoon to get a place, because it gets crowded. I don't give it 5 stars because people. If you are going to pee in the surroundings, take your paper with you. There is an almost empty container, if the bin is full, use it. We are loading sites like this by this type of people ... Normal that later they do not like us. IT DOES NOT COST ANYTHING !!!. Otherwise a marvel to be with the dogs ... LET'S TAKE CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT !!!!"

102,1453953,5,virum,14/08/2021,"Small parking for mini campers or vans, for motorhomes and large volume shortly before there are a couple of pitches. Beautiful views and a bar-restaurant with a good price. No problem sleeping."
102,1421602,5,Lauritrix,08/08/2021,"Nice place to spend a night. The scenery is spectacular. There is a bar nearby with very friendly staff. There are few camper vans (about 15), but it fills up before night."

102,1394691,2,Bullfrog,02/08/2021,"Spectacular place, it hurts that they have put a height limitation barrier 2mts. and motorhomes and camper vans no longer enter! there is an abandoned building that spoils the landscape!"

102,1228298,5,vanvwt3,31/05/2021,"We stayed one night, very good quiet place a bar 400 m away, if it is true space for 15 vans and height of 2m"
102,1136180,5,reicony,09/02/2021,"Very nice to stand and look at the sea. Just remember, there is a 2 meter passage restriction. Is new (02.2021)."
102,1110013,1,Scilash66,31/10/2020,"It seems like a place very much left to itself, neglected. It is not possible to park on the square because there is a barrier at 2 m. of h. Just before the barrier there is a recess where, in the low season, you can find a place. There is a campsite right there, and it seemed quite full to me."
102,1108521,5,Kerrybentley,28/10/2020,Great view's  stunning surfing great free stayed 3 nights
102,1014139,5,KarimMarine,30/08/2020,"Superb spot with a magnificent view and a very beautiful beach. We stayed here for two nights without any problems. Several vans slept next to us (barrier 2m high Max). For the toilets, we recommend the campsite bar."
102,980857,1,Schurfer,19/08/2020,"A 2-meter-high clearance has been placed at the entrance to the parking lot, so that only cars or small vans could access."
102,973438,2,roadtoparty303,17/08/2020,We spent the night there last week from Friday to Saturday and the next morning surprise the police woke us up they had installed the height barrier 2 3 before
102,962994,3,Jentilzubi,14/08/2020,"We have just arrived and they have put up the 2m high barrier, outside there are several places for AC and GV, next to the bar, and in the entrance fields and next to the campsite but it is not the same anymore. A pity, this year it is already the 3rd place that they put a barrier in the places we frequent with AC."
102,961462,2,Ita-leo,14/08/2020,"They already put up a barrier, you can't enter."
102,957316,4,anamirmir,13/08/2020,"We spent the night with impressive views and a good atmosphere, free but without any service for those who stay there. You can take a table but you have to collect it at night. The police have come by a couple of times but they haven't told us anything. I put 4 because there is no service but it is worth going"
102,942559,4,Vaquesenfurgo,09/08/2020,"We stayed here on 07/20/2020 and found it to be spectacular although quite busy. We had dinner at the Argentine Asador Rocamar, 100% recommended. Yesterday we repeated as a return stop for the trip, although there was some place they were not level and we preferred to leave. There was a small group under the porch of the abandoned house that looked like its tenants and it was not very good vibes."
102,939245,5,lajoa,08/08/2020,"The place is spectacular, yes !!!!! I would like to thank all of you who have come to fuck paradise. 15 years enjoying and caring for 3 days ke you come fuck it. to all of you who have set up your stall, showered at 6 o'clock in the afternoon with soap, wash dishes in the shower, take out chairs, tables, hangers, etc ... in the middle of the walk ... it is not an area, it is a cement parking lot . THANKSSS"

102,921997,1,mirperfer,02/08/2020,"The setting and views are good but the picnic site is super dirty, there are many people and many vans, I would not recommend it!"
102,911010,2,Pooolo,30/07/2020,"Nice place to visit during the week. Friday night arrives and there is a lot of traffic. On Saturday from the first hour to the fullest and people do not respect rest or public places since they ""reserve"" the few tables that there are putting umbrellas and food so that others cannot use it all day. A lot of dirt we even saw rats ... A shame, since the environment is spectacular ..."
102,907107,5,Rojorgil,28/07/2020,"Amazing, there is not too much parking space and there are no services but with stunning views"

102,898213,3,Orome111,25/07/2020,"Lots of noise, people do not respect rest and everything is quite dirty. Many campers and some AC. The site is beautiful, but together we are killing it."
102,895811,2,lince23,24/07/2020,July 25. Lots of people and little parking space. noisy. Bad place. I do not recommend at all
102,873118,5,Agutito,16/07/2020,"Ideal place to spend a night, two or whatever is necessary. It does not have any services, but spectacular views, a nearby bar for coffee and on an access to the beach next to the lifeguard's house if there is a shower. Very quiet place. Crystal clear beach water, spectacular !!"
102,869448,5,jonas94,14/07/2020,Here you can easily spend several nights in a camper. Right next to it is a very nice campsite.
102,856651,4,Florimotorhome,09/07/2020,"Idyllic place to spend the night, it does not have any services but it is worth sleeping listening to the sea, next to there are restaurants, and at night there are only camper and AC, access to the beach is good."
102,844012,5,Sanval,01/07/2020,Good views
102,830717,5,Sheilatore,21/06/2020,"Perfect place, next to the sea, we arrived around 22:30 and we had a hard time finding a place because there were many people, many caravans and vans. Idyllic and safe site."
102,792367,4,karrete,07/03/2020,In winter great. I guess in summer it will be another song
102,769996,5,Sherpa777,18/01/2020,Pretty spot! Can be windy as it’s exposed. Another surfing spot!

102,729157,4,Franck.mushu.chris,24/10/2019,Amazing views. quiet (end of October)
102,702660,5,TheJohnJons,24/09/2019,We went there by accident but it was totally worth it. Beautiful land view of Cantabria on a cliff which is big enough so you can put out your chairs and enjoy the landscape without being in the way of other visitors.  You can go to a small beach which is closed to dogs in high season which is till September. But anyways there is a small lagoon where we could swim with our dog. At the evening a lot of fishermen. One thing I wanted to mention is the dog poop which is not only from the tourists dogs.  Just to be fair.
102,698052,5,5Baboub,20/09/2019,"Everything is there, view, beach, shower, parking. In the top"
102,684208,4,cece6418,10/09/2019,Parking with nice view (no service). easy access spot popular surfers ideal for spending one or two nights

102,639464,5,LaPeque2018,18/08/2019,Very good place to spend the day and spend the night. Very quiet at night. Wonderful views.
102,635275,1,luisfernandez,16/08/2019,"Site very coveted and is not so much, there are other spaces much wider and less stressful in high season."
102,624909,5,ohmyroad,13/08/2019,"Superb spot with breathtaking views of a bay with turquoise waters - Very popular in season! Pretty noisy and not many places, you have to arrive early."
102,609430,4,Franqui1014,08/08/2019,"We arrived and it was full of cars. While we were taking a bath, little by little they started to leave and we could park the vans. We slept facing the sea, listening to the waves. Brutal!"
102,596069,5,rbenitez,03/08/2019,"The site is very beautiful, but you have to come soon and wait for people to leave to get a good place."
102,590370,5,Montsrrt,01/08/2019,"Awesome place to spend the day, take a bath on the beach and spend the night. Amazing views and very quiet at night. Unfortunately, they will ban access to motor homes and campers because of the incivism of some, who throw chemical toilet into the sea and those who do not pick up their dog's poops. It is certainly a shame that there are people like that."
102,577499,3,Ita-leo,26/07/2019,Since we have been here for years and the year is going to put barriers thanks to the g ..... that leave garbage and do not collect the poops of their dogs empty water tanks and pottiys mean cagan. what a shame and then nobody does it but that is the reality.
102,561995,4,sm56,19/07/2019,Nice view. super calm. no more than the other comments.
102,553714,3,bitrix,14/07/2019,"Many people, there is hardly space and little quiet. Nice but it stays dirty. We have not stayed."

 station."
102,507623,4,fraphnc,08/06/2019,Quiet night on this beautiful coast very rugged. Spot apparently known for surfers.

102,470143,4,Marengo,28/04/2019,"Nice spot to watch surfers in action, at night you sleep with the sound of the waves. Camping bar with toilets close by. Spent a quiet night with 6 other vans."
102,469392,5,Aniee,27/04/2019,"A corner with charm. It is tiny and sometimes there are problems to find a hole. But if there is a gap, it is perfect for vans and motorhomes. Next to the beach and not far from a bar if you want to go for a drink. In the summer months, it can be very busy."
102,457018,5,irmaarabaolaza,17/04/2019,"VERY RECOMMENDED! Spectacular beach and suitable place to spend the night. There are a couple of restaurants in the area, and in case they are closed, there is a campsite a few meters away that has a bar. We will be back!"
102,452416,5,johnconorb,11/04/2019,"Small spot quiet and really nice, quiet night with the sound of the sea and seagulls, some comings and goings in the night. I contradict the previous comment because the access is very simple and accessible to all, if there are places."
102,444044,2,bonus1951,24/03/2019,Very small parking. the exit is not easy. I hit the muffler on the road and you are not in the right direction to go to Bilbao. shame because the view is beautiful!
102,437040,5,FullTimer07,06/03/2019,"Good spot between the cliffs, the sea and the beach (parking without service) quiet and relatively unpopulated in low season. Good for lunch, spend the afternoon and why not spend the night! ;-) to avoid if too much wind because very exposed!"

102,349905,5,joxe,23/08/2018,"An excellent corner of the beach next to the beach. There is no problem with parking at 7 meters. At the same time, there is a small beach, showers, snorkelling options, fishing ... There is a small supermarket just a short distance away."
102,349139,5,lurdesmoreira,22/08/2018,Amazing!!!
102,320955,5,smarambaudtgrenapin,08/08/2018,"Very nice place: beautiful view, access to the beach very easy. .. Do not hesitate to arrive in the evening to find a place ..."
102,320707,5,jipaw,08/08/2018,Superb place. A calm night. A beautiful view. We arrived at 16:30 and found a place with our nasturtium of 8 m (lucky) places are rare in this season. Parking is free from 20h and around 23h when people leave the restaurant.
102,316800,5,azaharaCADDY,05/08/2018,Perfect site with sea views!
102,306449,5,ToyTraveller,30/07/2018,"A spectacular site next to the sea, very quiet to spend the night. There is a little beach nearby."
102,301635,4,gibus85,26/07/2018,Beautiful views. Too bad the building of the hotel is in ruins arriving at the parking lot.
102,285852,4,slimon16,11/07/2018,"Very convenient for a night, very quiet, little passage."
102,284947,3,Drosses,10/07/2018,"Perfect site, but it will not last long. In the end they will prohibit parking because of the incivivos of always that they think that they are in a camping, when it is a public parking."
102,276327,2,bob56,27/06/2018,"Correct place without service, beautiful view, not very easy to access. Parking is free around 20h cars parked for the beach."
102,250125,5,donalandger,10/05/2018,Beautiful spot didn't spend the night but I'm sure you can no problem the restaurant is now closed and derelict
102,239090,5,asanrod,21/04/2018,"Very quiet and super nice area. It was quite full, I imagine that in the middle of summer it will be more complicated to find a place"
102,237469,5,tito84,16/04/2018,"Quiet and enlightened area, recommended"
102,229467,1,critom07,25/03/2018,Avoid stormy days (huge waves breaking on the rocks) and Friday nights (boom boom all night). Both cumulated and you do not close the eye of the night!
102,206888,3,lesepicurieux.eu,28/10/2017,Nice setting on a quiet parking but nevertheless with a lot of camper even in this season ... Fishing and many fishermen but not seen fish!
102,200931,4,Anna910,07/10/2017,Nice parking spot at the beach. Very quiet at night. Close to restaurants.
102,200104,5,michel06,04/10/2017,A great night on this extra site (Michel and Vero)
102,180291,4,campingcarpassion,20/08/2017,"Nice but overcrowded (ok we are in season). 200 m from a great Argentine restaurant. (There are 3 establishments nearby), surprising corner, quite quiet when we pass the few motorhomes arriving very late and people who throw their glasses in the skips nearby. Access sloping indeed but it even goes with long vehicles"
102,176811,5,prnjanuario,16/08/2017,"Amazing view and beautiful place to have a bath, very nice place to wake up."
102,171130,5,mkarmen,11/08/2017,Spectacular location It is a beautiful area with a lot of rotation. Surfing area It is very nice to see the change of landscape offered by low tide and high tide. Perfect bathing area for a dip.
102,168483,3,pacasu,08/08/2017,"Quiet place, although with plenty of AC. The landscape is very cool."
102,162428,1,wagamax,31/07/2017,"Parking more than full, to avoid in high season, probably noisy too. We went back to the spot on the other side of the bay"
102,161628,3,ilovecalif,30/07/2017,Surely super spot because the place is very beautiful .... but tight between 2 trucks less than 30 cm and revelers at night. to avoid if you like calm.
102,156153,5,Dulcineavipp,22/07/2017,Very good
102,154754,5,jaga,20/07/2017,"Perfect, quiet. Overnight without problems. At 4pm enough place to park, at night all full."
102,137388,4,furlongandrew,25/05/2017,"The setting is fantastic, the beaches offer surfing, snorkeling, fishing and the closed in cove is worth exploring... but it remains a carpark with vehicles coming and going. So while it is a lovely setting it is noisy so don't expect a peaceful nights sleep."
102,129965,5,mmm,21/04/2017,Very pretty place. no service but nice little restaurant right next door.
102,117884,3,ndmolanes,06/01/2017,"Very quiet place, luxury views."

102,111113,4,asiereiro,23/10/2016,"Quiet and with the noise of the waves, perfect for spending the night. Saturday night full of ACs and vans."
102,106579,5,svt0853,22/09/2016,"Ideal place to spend the night. Very quiet, there were 4 of us in September, facing the Cantabrian sea and with a campsite with a bar and store a 3-minute walk away. At night the sound of the sea, what a pleasure."
102,100837,4,lesmms,27/08/2016,"Pretty place and we were peaceful, lulled by the sound of the waves. Arriving in the evening at 10 p.m., we found a place (the last cars were leaving the area). It is also possible to find a place in front of the campsite a hundred meters before but the ground is not very flat and it is certainly less calm."
102,96345,4,jpjohner,17/08/2016,"Not very easy access for large people, everything else is said."
102,91629,4,hannahiss,09/08/2016,"Beautiful place, ideal for swimming, pity that there are papers on the ground. In season arrive after 20h to have a place (difficult to access during the day). WE to avoid in my opinion because very busy with locals. The hotel located at this location is abandoned. Resto ""La cuca"" bof and expensive but it helps and you can buy bread (other restaurant above not tested)."
102,91549,4,GV,09/08/2016,Very nice a lot of places are released between 19 and 21h
102,88986,1,theotomsamlilou,03/08/2016,Simply shielded!
102,88711,5,estellelelagadec@sfr.fr,03/08/2016,Too bad no space
102,87753,4,luthy,01/08/2016,"Very nice location, sometimes a little noisy at night by young partygoers, possibility of having fresh bread and croissants at the nearby bar, grocery store opposite the campsite 500 meters away. The only regret is the lack of service for motorhomes."
102,87752,5,Lowa,01/08/2016,"We spent one night there, very good spot and magnificent view!"
102,82995,4,mcm64,18/07/2016,"Very nice location, magnificent view, quiet. Lots of people during the day, but in the evening there is room."
102,82575,3,luluani,17/07/2016,"We could not stop on this place but we continue the road and we landed on the beach that we see right in front of this site. We found a free lot to spend the day swimming and eating. Some shops, restaurants and bakery. Sublime beach."
102,80278,3,catenke,08/07/2016,"Magnificent setting. Crowded in the evening because of many divers and swimmers, but at night, very calm. Except last night when we celebrated France's victory in the semi-finals. Heading to the final and for us Portugal. It's going to be hot ;) No service, just trash cans."
102,78735,4,kaelimatat,27/06/2016,It's not always easy to find a place in Islares. Very beautiful site but which saturates in high season. Good little surfs on a rising tide. Beautiful paddle rides...
102,77368,5,benimark,17/06/2016,"Fantastic spot with stunning views. Quiet with good parking overlooking beach. Closed down Hotel adjacent but good Restuarants & Cafe bar nearby. Lagoon for swimming, also popular with surfers. highly recommend but get there early"
102,65681,4,Lucien3000,18/03/2016,Very peaceful with the gentle sound of the sea. Next to a beautiful cove and indeed a nice little bar. A good spot!
102,59421,5,gege83,04/11/2015,"Great for surfing, fishing and overnight camping"
102,50120,3,lenamael,18/08/2015,You have to be lucky to find a place among the camper vans but the view at daybreak is magical.. very good spot to start surfing and bodybuilding.
102,48164,4,alfie10,11/08/2015,"Great place to spend a couple of days. several little beaches, a shower in one of them, several restaurants and right next to the sea, only with the noise of the waves. It's a shame not to have a town with services closer."
102,45303,5,Rinor,01/08/2015,"Beautiful place, you fall asleep to the sound of the waves. We have slept accompanied by several vans and AC"
102,44978,5,Tonytess,30/07/2015,"Superb stopover for swimming, enjoying the magnificent landscape, having a little restaurant and having a big sleep! In the top!"
102,42893,5,zoreole16,20/07/2015,Magnificent place. on the other hand we arrived on a Saturday and the parking lot was crowded so we opted for a quieter little parking spot just as we arrived on the left. much calmer and away from the light. beach surfing and diving for two days
102,42208,5,osertz2012,16/07/2015,"To be with children because the bathing area is very good and there is no problem with the police, the only thing is that the place is small, they are usually very full"
102,42171,4,Zyllia1,15/07/2015,Very nice. No convenience store. No water. A nice diving spot.
102,27871,4,Titom64,18/10/2014,A beach at low tide appears under the rocks... a magical place.
102,22319,1,vivi13,12/08/2014,"It was crowded with full, stinking trash cans. We didn't stay."
102,20259,5,lekefe,30/07/2014,A little paradise
102,17627,4,jpbearnais,02/07/2014,The parking lot is not in Castro Urdiales but in Islares on the Ensenada de Oribon maps. Stunning
115,3270512,5,LauraSanzDiez,07/09/2023,"Very quiet place, but busy with vehicles spending the night. I imagine most of them to enter the park. There is a paved area and a dirt area, a lake and bars and restaurants just a stone's throw away. It is at the elephant entrance to the Cabarceno park. Highly recommended to sleep there, but you may not find a place"
115,3267996,5,sanviii,07/09/2023,"very good place to spend the night, with a lake next to it to bathe, and very quiet. Attached to the entrance of Cabarceno. A bar 2 minutes walk away during park hours"
115,3245250,5,Marceldj,01/09/2023,Excellent place to visit the park. Silent in the night. A bit noisy in the evenings in summer.
115,3237764,5,Castel03,30/08/2023,Perfect place to spend the night or the day.
115,3233111,4,bertacampos,29/08/2023,Very quiet area to spend the night. And attached to the Cabarceno park.
115,3217020,4,viky2023,25/08/2023,"A perfect place to spend the night when visiting the park. Very crowded, better to arrive early"
115,3212837,3,Matillas,24/08/2023,It is comfortable But there is a lack of water intakes Drainage Some streetlight Marks so that everyone does not park as they want I could not sleep at all since there was an animal nearby with a cowbell and it was moving all night
115,3201098,4,twinsfamilia,22/08/2023,"Lots of motorhomes, but room for vans! Close to a small lake, ideal for cooling off before or after the zoo!"
115,3198177,4,Raulus1980,22/08/2023,Parking without services in a very beautiful environment. The lake is very good with people bathing. Ideal for visiting the park. It was full of motorhomes. The town is small and very pretty.
115,3187351,4,Yeraybc,20/08/2023,"We spent two nights. It is a nice place to visit the park the next day or to spend the night after visiting it, if you leave late. There is a water source nearby, where the townspeople also get their supplies. Sometimes it is crowded."
115,3185849,4,hugo3507,20/08/2023,"Tranquilo, lake with warm water to take a dip and cool off after seeing the Cabárceno animal park. Quiet night, many shades to eat. No services. There is a fountain with water. Nearby restaurants to walk (100 meters). To repeat!!!"
115,3183186,4,Familygarcia,19/08/2023,Very spacious parking but crowded with motorhomes at the very door of the park. Without services but very comfortable to spend the night and enter early in the morning
115,3180526,4,JuanAyora,19/08/2023,You have to get there early because otherwise there is no room. It is very calm. It is ideal if you go to the park. The area has no services but it is close to the town.
115,3171794,4,cris1983,18/08/2023,if you arrive in the middle of the afternoon there is no room. The parking without any service is nice since there is a very cool lake with ducks for children and a step away from the town or taking a little step watching the elephants in the park. but very crowded
115,3167514,5,GuismoteenDana,17/08/2023,"Environment of 10. Widely used by visitors to the annex park. Please, there are containers, let's keep it clean and not be excessively expansionist so that more traveling companions can enjoy it."
115,3155461,2,javeasteve5,15/08/2023,"Don’t bother in August it’s noisy up to 23.00 kids and dogs everywhere.  Saturday night in excess of 100 vehicles. Vehicles still arriving at 00.30. Several walks, nice once past unofficial toilet area. Shade near lake, other side in sun most of day. Come prepared as NO services now, which is not surprising having seen some of overnighters antics. B4 was Totally different outside holiday period."
115,3152430,5,ateixi6,15/08/2023,"Very good place to spend the night, without services but with a charming landscape. The place is very crowded and it is better to arrive before 6:30 p.m., which is when the park closes. Despite being full of caravans we had a good and quiet night"
115,3148508,4,Asierlo94,14/08/2023,"Ample place to park the camper, there is a small lake and you can take a walk on a path around Cabarceno."
115,3146405,2,Ane2015,14/08/2023,"Lots of caravans, no services. A lot of noise, motorhomes arriving at night. Where we were we touched something of cost. The good thing, you are one minute from the park"
115,3145517,3,tractopelle69,14/08/2023,A lot of people !!!! A lot of noise !!!
115,3142086,2,speyk,14/08/2023,"A nice place but quite noisy to sleep, there are too many people, arrivals and departures at all hours, people talking all the time. There are no services and if you arrive later than 7:00 p.m., it is most likely that you will not have a place."
115,3138600,5,feliespinosa,13/08/2023,"perfect for visiting Cabárceno, the lake has a wonderful bath, and the area is quiet and very pleasant to walk. Elephants and other animals can be seen along the paths that surround the park."

115,3135888,4,BerlinaCamper,13/08/2023,"Good place to spend the night, the only bad thing is that there are no services. We arrived around 6:00 p.m. and there were plenty of free spaces, but around 8:00 p.m. they were all gone, very crowded. The lake is beautiful with a large shady spot as it is full of trees. In the morning it is more crowded since the park entrance is right next to it."
115,3113567,4,Vogele,10/08/2023,"Excellent place to stand to visit the Cabarceno park. Many places, large lake to swim. Restaurant within walking distance."
115,3113090,3,Nightfamily,10/08/2023,"We stayed there in a rooftop tent. Helped us out a lot, but if the setting is nice, the site is a victim of its own success. Lots of people, arrivals at all hours and awakening in the early morning at 6am by the garbage collectors who empty the large public trash cans noisily. On the other hand, practical if you intend to go to the zoo. Otherwise, we do not particularly recommend."
115,3102343,5,mirimi000,08/08/2023,"We have stopped only to eat and rest, very good place. Very quiet, no car noise, and shade. There were several motorhomes, but plenty of space. Overnight stay is allowed."

115,3070664,5,xurris,03/08/2023,"Spacious for motorhomes, clean and with views of the lake, super nice and quiet. In the surroundings you can see some animals from the Cabarceno park, since the entrance is right there. The town is cool to see, lots of mountains. It does not have services for AC."
115,3058316,5,cristianvia,01/08/2023,"Brutal, what a calm. Great views meadows and a beautiful lake. Ideal for large cars due to its space. Be careful to enter by road and not on the road, it is possible but more difficult"
115,3027358,5,rodrigo,27/07/2023,Ideal for visiting Cabárceno. It is a pity that it does not have a water intake and a place to discharge water.
115,3027109,4,EstelaSolans,27/07/2023,"The parking lot is very spacious, it was full yesterday, even so we slept super peacefully. A 2-minute walk away, there is a store to buy and the park entrance is when leaving the pk."
115,3021076,4,familleLEGARS,25/07/2023,"Very nice place for one night to be operational the next day for the park, duck in the lake, elephant right next to the parking lot. The park is magical. In a motorhome it is largely doable, some road and parking restrictions but anyway, you have to partly walk to see the animals."
115,3004203,4,Sin.deentrega,22/07/2023,Perfect to spend the night and enter the park. It is allowed to enter with motorhomes but there are long restricted routes so if you do not want to miss anything you will have to walk a lot or use bikes
115,3004001,4,emmarcas,22/07/2023,"No services, but the views are spectacular, at the gates of the natural park, at night you can hear the elephants. The lake is very beautiful, and we were able to take out the table and dine outside. Is free"
115,2999813,5,cristiqd,21/07/2023,"Perfect to spend a couple of days (it does not have services). Fantastic environment, close to the town and the park. The pleasant and respectful company. Broad and flat. A place to enjoy with the family."

115,2989717,5,LuchiLiu,19/07/2023,"Parking area next to the Cabárceno park, perfect for spending a quiet night and then visiting the park. It has a lake next to it with some trees and a picnic area that make it super relaxing. In the town there are bars and a small store where you can buy just enough, because everything is very expensive."
115,2985892,4,Mvariant,19/07/2023,"Perfect to park and spend the night before visiting the natural park. At 09:30 they open and it is just 50 meters away. There is no electricity or water service. Pretty flat and quiet. Nearby town to go on foot. It has a lake where you can hang out. The first week of July there are plenty of free places, but don't arrive too late to make sure."
115,2984090,5,berlisendaxtr,18/07/2023,"Perfect to spend the night before entering the natural area or after when you are tired. At the end of the night everything was filled with campers and AC. After 11pm there were no noises or incidents, the lake is next to it with no mosquitoes. The Civil Guard passed by and said nothing."

115,2835254,3,Camper1981,09/06/2023,"nice level parking lot at a bathing lake, close to the entrance. Without any supply only rubbish bins. 4 car sleepers leave their garbage. Not like that!!"
115,2811316,3,Laviexlavraie,02/06/2023,"Nice place but lots of mosquitoes because of the lake. I had to wake up to close the window at 2am and couldn't get back to sleep until 4am so many mosquitoes had come in! I recommend sleeping with all the windows closed to avoid this unpleasant experience. Apart from that, the place is calm and welcoming."
115,2806047,5,mmvmonica,31/05/2023,Very quiet place without services but very good. Paved and leveled.

115,2721203,4,ChemaMartin,04/05/2023,"Beautiful place overlooking the lake. From time to time the kids appear with cars and music at full blast. It also does not have enabled services, although apparently it had them in its day. But it is a good place to rest with bars and a shop nearby."
115,2715296,5,MaikelJc,02/05/2023,A good place to spend the night

115,2660321,4,LosMarin,11/04/2023,"Perfect parking lot to visit the park, super quiet nights, views to wake up, green area and lake in the background. Pity the zero lighting and lack of services. Cozy town 100m away."
115,2656256,4,memeloo,10/04/2023,Good place to visit Cabarceno or Santander area. There are no services but you can spend the night without problem. At the same entrance to the park and 100m from the town. A lake next to it that allows you to spend the day.
115,2647392,3,Kukufatos,07/04/2023,"Ideal for being next to the park entrance, but it lacks lighting and signage. Do not go out without a flashlight if you return at night. The town's restaurants are only open at noon, some in high season also open for dinner. BEWARE, the GPS makes you a zigzag through the town difficult to make the curves with great AC. You can go straighter along the main street."
115,2641403,5,Barbosa74,05/04/2023,"Perfect for visiting the park early, without services but with a beautiful green area and a lake that provides beautiful views when you wake up. Brilliant!"

115,2628792,4,bkb,29/03/2023,"Large flat parking lot. Shady. No services. Sorting bins. At the edge of a pretty lake. Very quiet nights. Ideal for visiting the Parque de la Naturaleza, an unforgettable visit in a dream setting."
115,2624336,4,juankein,25/03/2023,"Quiet area, without services and quite level. On weekends it is usually full of motorhomes. With a lake next to it, to be able to walk."
115,2622977,4,ekauws,24/03/2023,"Nice quiet place, don't arrive too late to have room! and you walk 150 meters and you can see elephants...nice when you don't expect it!"
115,2587187,5,maryontheroad,22/02/2023,"Absolutely loved this spot. It was my first night that I ever spend in the van. Even though I was feeling anxious, this place felt so safe and welcoming that I stayed for 3 days without any interruptions. Locals are politely greeting you and in my experience even up for a little chat. It was lovely to have the little village nearby to drink a fresh beer in the sunshine. Also loved the elephants!"
115,2586518,5,Ainike_,22/02/2023,"Nice place to spend the night, next to a lake. The parking lot is quite big. Right next to it is the natural park."
115,2586302,5,RowanHulsman,21/02/2023,"A nice big and free parking place next to a little lake. There is no service here.
In the afternoon it was busy with locals but they left in the early evening. A lot of campers arrived later in the evening, the parking lot was almost full in the morning. The spots are spacious, there's also place for bigger campers. In town was a little supermarket where I could buy bread at 09:00."
115,2568686,5,asrlpb,04/02/2023,"Perfect place to sleep and visit the park, next to a nice lake and the entrances, quite level and calm, only garbage containers."
115,2567931,5,Aroa90,04/02/2023,Delighted with the site. No catch.
115,2556306,5,Itocan,20/01/2023,"True about the GPS of Google maps, it tells you to make a very tight turn, too much even for a car. If it happens to you, don't worry, turn left to get out of the way and re-enter the same path. Otherwise perfect. Some light and filling and unloading services would be missing to border on perfection. Today, January 20, totally empty. In high season I don't know."
115,2550279,5,CrisCar,12/01/2023,"Perfect place to spend the night if you plan to visit the Cabárceno park! The town is 2 minutes walk, there are some bars and a grocery store! The site is beautiful, in front of a lake and the park is well worth it whether you go with children or without them."
115,2533107,5,Luala,29/12/2022,"Great to visit the park the next day, the beautiful lake for a walk. We slept peacefully with more AC, among the first to enter the park. It's a pity that it doesn't have services"
115,2517254,5,Rutafamilia22,09/12/2022,"The incredible place, ideal to enter the park the next day. Right next to a beautiful lake. In the comments they said that it was very dark and a bit dangerous, we were surrounded by familiar ACs so it was good"
115,2491512,4,adrlana,11/11/2022,"Large and safe parking next to the park and the town, but super dark, it is even dangerous, but since it is free, it cannot be required either."
115,2478745,5,cuncanes,02/11/2022,Quiet and excellent area to spend the night and visit the Cabarceno park. The park entrance is 2 min. There are no services but the views are excellent. The duck lake and the lawn provide plenty of play for children and families.
115,2474875,5,l3ur3t3,31/10/2022,"Very good option if the next day you visit the Cabarceno park, since it is next to the entrance. BE CAREFUL with the GPS indications since it indicates a narrow path for large motorhomes. Then we discovered that it can be accessed from the same town of Cabarceno and the access is much better. It is a parking lot and not an area. It is next to a lake and there are many places."
115,2474706,5,asettiki,31/10/2022,Beware of Google maps!!! It takes you to the field!!! Better to follow road signs.

115,2365535,4,juanjopetru,12/09/2022,Place in good situation and quiet to spend the night if you plan to visit the park the next day. Located around a lake with many ducks (there are also some rats at night). To get to it you go through somewhat narrow streets to go by motorhome but you don't get stuck.
115,2350754,3,Sjeveemet,08/09/2022,Had a quiet overnight stay next to a lake. Perfect to visit Parcs Cabarceno. Next to small village with restaurants. Only waste bins present
115,2350338,4,JosEliSaulNoa,08/09/2022,"Wide area, it has nothing to write home about but the comfort to wake up and be close to Cabárcenos is appreciated."
115,2348925,5,drp60343,07/09/2022,"Motorhome area, attached to the Cabarceno park, on Lake Acebo. There is no service to load and empty gray and black water. Gratuitous. Ideal to spend the night before entering Cabárceno or the night of the day after entering the park. Good views and a quiet place. Perfect place to spend the night. There is plenty of parking space. August 2022."
115,2348695,4,alexjandrosp,07/09/2022,"Very quiet parking, it has room for more than 30 AC and campers, right next to a lake and about 200 is the town that has restaurants and a little store that gets you out of trouble. It has no services and the emptying and filling of water is broken but there is a small fountain next to it, what do you do?"
115,2331953,4,roserc,02/09/2022,"Very good and quiet to spend the night without any noise and visit the park, green area around! I don't give it a 5 because it doesn't have services for AC"
115,2323986,5,Serflorido,31/08/2022,"Area without services but very nice, next to the Cabárceno park and the lake. We spent one night and visited the town, drinking cider at the elephant restaurant. The next day we went to the park. I recommend it."
115,2323413,3,windalo,31/08/2022,"It is not an area, it is just a parking area next to one of the entrances to the Cabarceno park and next to the town. However, we slept very well. To bursting, among so many people there were some crossed to catch two places. A water point would be needed given the influx of motorhomes to the park, which already pays well for entry."
115,2323247,5,Chusfurgon,30/08/2022,Very crowded at night but quiet during the day
115,2314653,4,RicharE,28/08/2022,Parking without services. Very well located. Attached to the town of Cabárceno and also from the entrance to the park. quiet place

115,2292820,4,PedroRaul,24/08/2022,"Great place to park and the next day enter the park, badly indicated in the application go directly to Cabarceno (Pueblo) and at the church turn right and go straight to the parking lot. It's a pity that there is no service for AC or a bloody lamppost... last night it was around 80 or 90 AC But it looks like they don't care and they ignore the people who are going to visit the park! Very bad in that aspect!"
115,2277887,5,Pluginawer,21/08/2022,"A wonderful place to spend the night before visiting the park and totally free. The worst has been some behavior that we have seen from some user, such as leaving excessive space between vehicles, people washing dishes in a trough... If we don't behave every day they will clip our wings more and it's a shame."
115,2274969,4,Anit23,20/08/2022,"Good place to spend the night, next to Cabárceno. Negative aspect that some misuse by removing awnings, tables and chairs. Then we complain."

115,2270667,3,windalo,20/08/2022,"The location was poorly marked and led me down a back road to the park to a dirt lane at night. There is no water and it is very saturated in August. Except for a few that occupied the space of several vehicles, people respected the space. It is next to the town and at one of the entrances to Cabarceno Park. If you find a queue, go to the entrance that is a few meters away in the same town, because after the first entrance they cannot park the motorhomes, and you avoid queuing."
115,2270426,2,AlbaR,19/08/2022,"NO CAMPING! = Take out awning, tables and chairs. It is a car park, gentlemen, it is not necessary to leave 3 meters with the motorhome next door to set up the beach bar, with 1.5 meters to fit the rest of the companions is enough. A little solidarity and respect please!"
115,2268219,4,Chus66,19/08/2022,"We have spent a quiet night, to be the month of August. A very good option to start the visit to the park the next day. Too bad you don't have water services available."
115,2267758,4,AinaMSG,19/08/2022,"Perfect place to spend the night if you want to see Cabarceno Park, since one of the entrances is there. There is plenty of parking space. Quiet and pleasant, right next to a very nice lake. In some area of the parking lot you have to level it."
115,2263614,3,coletademelilla,18/08/2022,"perfect area to visit the park and spend the night good views of the lake very large and quiet but without any services, before it had a fountain but the mayor closed it because he says that motorhomes use a lot of water, very bad for the mayor"

115,2257270,5,autofesta,17/08/2022,"We have spent 2 nights there and it has been great, good views and a quiet place to rest, a few kilometers away there is a gas station to empty gray / black water and fill with clean water."
115,2254362,5,lopefamily,17/08/2022,Spacious site with many seats. The views are beautiful and there is the lake where you can take a dip. It has no services but the town is very close and it has a restaurant with menu prices and homemade food. Highly recommended.
115,2247488,4,elnano59,16/08/2022,"Great place to spend the day and spend the night, it has a great lake to bathe and enjoy with children, the pity is that it does not have any services, it is also 100% recommended before or after the entrance to the Cabarceno park."
115,2242808,4,calichy,15/08/2022,Recommended site 100% very quiet. We went on Saturday afternoon and there was almost no room. To visit the park best location. Restaurants next door. nice ride. There was even a boy selling blueberries from the area. I don't give it five stars because there are no services but to spend a perfect night
115,2238643,4,raulako,14/08/2022,"good rest area next to the lake, no services but ideal for visiting the park"
115,2235504,5,manuaroa,14/08/2022,"Well, an area to sleep without services, in high season there will be many people and in low season few, but it is logical. Quiet place and at the door of Cabarceno, if you go to Cabarceno and you can, forced to sleep there. The town is 200 meters away with bars"
115,2226329,5,LlunaOnaRoc,13/08/2022,"AC parking in an idyllic location, right at the entrance to the Cabarceno park and with a very cool lake. In high season there are many caravans and motorhomes. It would need services and paying for parking to make it an ideal place"
115,2219785,3,martaxixasT4,11/08/2022,ample parking space with a wooded grassy area next to a small lake. We were in August in high season. Starting at 7 in the afternoon it has started to get fatal. Lots of people camping in a bad way with very little respect. In the end we parked in the town to be able to sleep peacefully. For people like that they will end up closing it. It wouldn't hurt if the police stopped by from time to time.
115,2219543,5,Yolodaime,11/08/2022,"Good place, although as they say, its days are numbered. Most of the campers and motorhomes camping at ease... A pity"
115,2203668,5,NessRoad,09/08/2022,"A camping air was present here, many many motorhomes and vans but not disturbing from time to time. The place is top Shaded Nice walks around and especially that we had the chance to see buffaloes, elephants and gazelles from the park behind the location. Be respectful of the place because it's really nice."
115,2202297,5,Chusete,09/08/2022,"All very well. Very nice, quiet and comfortable place. It is a pity that its days are numbered due to the abuse of users. It looks like a campsite more than a parking lot. Then we will cry when we are prohibited from spending the night because of our own misuse."
115,2187958,4,sfrailed,07/08/2022,"It is a quiet place to spend the night at the gates of the park, we have slept with several caravans and vans. Highly recommended to visit Cabarceno."

We slept two nights and very well, although the volume of people is brutal, it looks like a campsite. Still we had no problems."
115,2158281,3,MireiaTomas,01/08/2022,"It is a parking lot without services but very spacious. As it is next to the entrance to the Cabárceno park, it fills up very early in high season. We personally don't like the camping atmosphere there (many people and very close together), but it's worth it if you want to sleep in the park itself."
115,2147302,5,kikilloatk,30/07/2022,We were spending the day and it was amazing! If I return to the area I will visit it again!

It has a lake attached to the parking lot. There were quite a few people taking a bath on these hot days. Be careful because there are quite a few mosquitoes. If I had a position to do the services it would be perfect. Lots of people with tables and chairs.
115,2095719,3,DavidCruc,19/07/2022,"Parking very well located for visiting the park, but without services... a pity"
115,2094712,3,ramon46,19/07/2022,"Quiet parking next to the lake. There are no services. Years ago you could empty gray and black water and also fill water. It is a shame to go less, since if you visit the park it is ideal to spend a couple of nights and services are needed. That's why 3 stars instead of 5."
115,2089127,5,NataliaSori,18/07/2022,"Enchanting place. Without services, (I saw people with bottles of water, but we did not see the source). Perfect to rest, spend the night and get to know the Cabárceno Natural Park. The townspeople are very friendly. We had a mishap and two neighbors helped us with everything we needed, even offering us their house."

115,2038743,4,Cristina4484,04/07/2022,"Nice place next to the park and a lake, many caravans spending the night. The only thing that must have been the village festivals and we listened to music at dawn."

It gets full of motorhomes but the place is very big and has trees that provide shade. The entrance to the park that is right next to it, which leads to the elephant gondola, is not open, however two minutes away there is another."
115,2004593,3,The_danew,23/06/2022,"Very good place to visit the park the next day, but with how busy it is, they could fix the emptying and filling area. That's why I put 3 stars"

115,1926126,3,Angeles136,28/05/2022,"The site is charming but again it is the users who bother and park as they want regardless of the others also taking items out. Once again, I advocate charging a small fee and controlling these types of places or they will ""die of success."""

115,1819925,3,ilviha,13/04/2022,"A good area to spend the night right next to the entrance to cabarc with green space. A complaint is incivility. The car parks are the line taking advantage of the space but there are four ready to park in a battery so that their door is next to the green area, leaving other motorhomes without parking, a real shame."
115,1819777,4,Estersanzp,13/04/2022,We have spent the night before visiting Cabarceno. I recommend arriving early because it is usually full. We arrived at 10 and there was no level space. Highly recommended to take level.

115,1711089,4,Sandier,16/12/2021,"Stayed last night after arriving on ferry. Lovely spot, very peaceful, only 5 vans in total. No restaurants in village open at 7pm though so take supplies. The wildlife park is worth every penny - beautiful.4* as no services  however garage just a couple of miles away so no problem."
115,1699451,4,XaviCarre,28/11/2021,"Very quiet in November, there were only 5 vans at night. Ideal for visiting the park the next morning."
115,1691666,4,Taigen,17/11/2021,It’s a shame the water supply has been decommissioned and wrapped in a tarp at present.
115,1685957,5,Santero82,12/11/2021,"We spent the night of the day before to go to the park and great place very quiet, the children had a great time and the spectacular views we will return"
115,1673063,5,danisan10,01/11/2021,"It's great. It is as seen in the photo. It is a huge parking lot, surrounded by nature. Next to the ""zoo"" of Cabárceno. If you go with children, then you have it to egg. The town is very small, the people are super nice and they eat very well."
115,1661540,5,solrrak,25/10/2021,Good place to sleep and the next day to go to Cabarceno. There is no type of service.
115,1658758,5,oscarpul,23/10/2021,"Fantastic site at the east entrance of the park. If they put the services for water changes, it would be to give it 6 stars"
115,1640670,5,saul74,12/10/2021,"Crowded site with motorhomes, but very quiet. I found a hole by chance. Fairly level. It is a parking lot."
115,1635087,3,Ivandaivatrans,09/10/2021,The site is great but once again there are problems with the filling of water and emptying the toilet. NOTHING WORKS AND IT IS COVERED WITH A COVER.
115,1615709,2,Regina65,29/09/2021,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with those who wrote about overcrowding. Everything's fine until the afternoon and then, in the evening, they'll come. Everything is parked up, people come and go until late at night. Inconsiderate campers who then talk loudly in front of their motorhome. Until well after midnight. Cars are run to charge the battery. A PITY"
115,1614222,3,job26,28/09/2021,We almost didn't come this time - because of the described overcrowding - but we are alone shortly after 12 o'clock. Otherwise as already described.
115,1607746,5,Crisymich,25/09/2021,"Chulisimo, the lake in front and a very good atmosphere with the rest of the caravans. BEWARE, it's 7.15pm, we have just arrived and there must already be about 30. With which, it seems that it fills up fast. The entrance doors to Cabarceno are about 20m. It is preferable to come to sleep the night before entering the park."
115,1597845,5,ChispiVan,21/09/2021,"Very good place to spend the night, next to the park and in a very beautiful setting."
115,1594318,4,Fitty06,20/09/2021,Very good place to spend the night. There is no place for cleaning waters. Waking up overlooking the lake is priceless.
115,1592508,5,Mireia6,19/09/2021,"Good place to spend the night, quiet and next to the Cabarceno Park. You can't dump gray water, it's sealed but otherwise great."
115,1568342,3,peke1984,11/09/2021,"Great place to spend the night, a pity that it does not have services, there were about 60 vehicles and some had to turn around because they did not fit more, at the east gate of Cabárceno, perfect to visit it"
115,1564794,4,llondru,10/09/2021,"Without services, perfect surroundings and situation, next to a lake and 2 literal steps from the entrance of Cabárceno park. We spent a very quiet night"
115,1559313,5,fran649,08/09/2021,"Highly recommended place, quiet and with a very beautiful environment. In the morning it is quite clear and at night it gets quite crowded, 100% recommended."
115,1557606,5,AET66,07/09/2021,"By the way, a shame that many users of motorhomes and campers in general, use the environment where our little ones run afterwards, play and eat as a toilet, I will never understand! There are Very Very Pigs !!"
115,1557601,5,AET66,07/09/2021,"Ideal place to spend a couple of nights and visit the park, we have spent 2 nights between August 25 and 27, it is fantastic and both children and adults have enjoyed it, there is also the lake and the environment. Highly recommended despite the lack of services. You will find these about 15 minutes from there at a gas station."
115,1548169,4,nereidasegovia,05/09/2021,We arrived at 9pm and there was space to park. Good place to sleep if you want to visit the park
115,1546261,3,Guri,04/09/2021,"Apart from what has already been commented by other users, given that the spaces are not signposted, we should be consistent when parking without leaving excessive spaces since the area is always very busy. It is also necessary for the city council to enable the services since they used to be there. At least the garbage issue is well resolved. Thanks"
115,1544529,4,Transitcustomer,03/09/2021,A paradise for cuddly campers. The lake is beautiful and clean. The adjoining village is idyllic. Very well attended and full in the evening. From time to time a snack mobile / ice cream truck also drives by.
115,1541446,5,lena9203,02/09/2021,"Quite full for September, but enough vehicles fit. Next to the lake itself, a family atmosphere and close to the town. 100% recommendable"

115,1531211,5,acinipo,30/08/2021,"Hello, compis, I have stayed two nights and two days in this parking lot and great seeing the elephants from the balla and some other animals, a grocery store 200 meters away, yes arrive early or do not open a site, what a pity the filling services do not work and emptied but still I put the 5 stars, I think we are abusing a lot of the camping until when they leave us."
115,1521944,4,IMF,28/08/2021,"Good parking to see the Cabarceno reserve, spectacular surroundings, next to a pond where you can take a bath, and one side of the park, from where you can see the elephants while you take a walk, a step away from the town to eat in its restaurants or buy some sandwiches at the grocery store."
115,1518909,5,vanfur,27/08/2021,"Quiet and beautiful place to spend the night, do not arrive too late because it gets crowded."
115,1506289,3,DiegoGlez,24/08/2021,"It is a pity that it no longer has filling and emptying. We spent two nights and the truth was very good. Quiet and in an area of 10. That is, if the car parks were delimited, many more places would be used since many, between motorhomes, left almost 2 meters of separation. We should think of the whole and not individually."
115,1504203,4,h1aventuras,23/08/2021,Family and quiet place we spent two very quiet nights and with a very good atmosphere great place
115,1499524,5,pittbull_j,22/08/2021,"Idyllic place, you can do paddle surfing in the little lake that there is and you sleep very well! Also getting up with the elephants at 100mts is brutal!"
115,1498202,5,HectorHerrero,22/08/2021,Perfect place to spend one or several nights. Attached to the Cabarceno park. Lake and grass area to put tables. 200 meters from the town where there is a shop to buy food and several restaurants. Quiet zone
115,1492036,4,paulikala,21/08/2021,We slept with many vans and AC. In high season it is peta. Nice area with the lake and next to the elephants of the park. Arrive early to get a seat. Just a broken epic-nic table. It would be nice if there were more. The children enjoyed the laguitos with other children.
115,1489085,4,AlexPizarro,20/08/2021,"You have to go early, we had to park in the adjacent concrete parking lot that is sloping, but with chocks it is solved. There are several bars and restaurants within 100 m, we had a good night, recommended."
115,1487981,5,Grease,20/08/2021,"We had a super good night. The parking lot was packed to the brim. Still around 10pm some AC or camper arrived, although it was already difficult to park. In the morning, to the Park! Expensive ticket for a family, but you can really enjoy watching the animals. There are some picnic tables to eat. It is appreciated that it is facilitated to stay overnight. Inns and Bars / Restaurants next door."
115,1485200,4,IriaVP,20/08/2021,"We arrived around 8 in the afternoon and the truth was we found a little hole by chance! It was already full and I am not surprised because the place is super quiet and full of possibilities: take a walk, enjoy the lake, the children can enjoy quietly ... Highly recommended! It would be perfect if it had emptying and filling services."
115,1484211,5,BatVanT5,19/08/2021,"After 6 years we come back and great, that is, if you have to go early to be able to park, it is quite full. Tables and chairs can be taken out and it is a nice place to walk and a nice place to sleep, leave it clean and we can continue to enjoy this wonderful place."
115,1483754,5,siracaravaning,19/08/2021,Recommended place to sleep next to Holly Lake and if you are going to enter the Cabarceno park it is next to one of the entrances. If you park next to the lake there is more shade. The elephants of the park can be seen on a little path next to the parking lot.
115,1478220,5,Mariahps,18/08/2021,"We arrived at 7pm and it was full, we had a hard time finding a corner but it was worth it. The next day in the morning it was almost completely emptied, so it is worth going early and getting a good place. It is next to the town, which there are several bars and a small shop"
115,1471546,4,pattper,17/08/2021,"Pleasant and practical parking for visiting the animal park. Avoid during school holidays, especially July and August (crowded parking lot)."

115,1464652,5,Jabali2020,16/08/2021,"We have spent two nights here and we have not had any kind of problem, perfect place to spend the night if we are going to visit the park, what is true is that from 8:00 p.m. the parking lot fills up and it is already difficult to find a hole"
115,1458260,3,bimbaraner,15/08/2021,"It does not have any service, perfect parking to visit the park. By the way, in the Cabárceno park there is a lot of limitation of motorhome traffic, on many roads they prohibit their passage ... in the area of Tigers and gorillas it is outrageous, a site of leftovers and forbidden."
115,1458099,4,viajeros33,14/08/2021,"The lake is a great place to spend the night. It is at the door of the Cabárceno National Park and is a perfect place to enjoy, whether with family, friends, as a couple or even meditate, although in summer there are many people and you must arrive before 6 to get a good place . There is no water change area and that is why I do not give it a 5. In the town there is a restaurant and a shop."
115,1455880,4,dandindan,14/08/2021,"Beautiful place by the lake, but in August a lot of people, you have to arrive early to get a place. It allows walks in the area, and the town is next door if you need something. There are no toilets."
115,1451599,4,PeppeSaggese,13/08/2021,"Good area to visit the park, spend a day in nature and sleep peacefully. Nice view of the lake. It is preferable to arrive before 3 pm because it is difficult to find a place. No unloading and No loading."

115,1447891,4,vanevalencia,13/08/2021,"No services, but it is comfortable to sleep. Elephants and some other animals can be seen. There is a really cool lake and picnic tables. Arrive before 12 because later it fills up. If you arrive late at night, impossible, people park where they want ..."
115,1447659,4,TRR78,12/08/2021,"Great place to stop and see the park or as a simple stop. It is a pity that it does not have any more services, such as water filling."
115,1447514,4,jonatanpardo,12/08/2021,"A simple parking without services but strategic to enter Cabárceno Park early. If when leaving the park you don't have a place, go to Liaño, there is a free area (43.383042, -3.858923)."

115,1441175,3,Nathalie2018,11/08/2021,"The place is wonderful, green, small lake, trees, many parking spaces.... drawback: a lot of family fuss!!! If you are looking for calm, relaxation and tranquility, do not spend the afternoon or night here. This is similar to a playground without even the swings, a lot of fuss."
115,1438701,4,LuciaTaboada,11/08/2021,"The setting is spectacular and it is right at the entrance of the park, which allows you to enter early without having to wait long in line. Of course, like canned sardines. Around 6pm it starts to fill up so if you plan to go, try to make it before that time to be able to park the AC. You cannot change waters or refill."
115,1436497,5,Almindra,10/08/2021,"At the door of the park next to the lake, it is super good, totally recommended"
115,1420682,5,PabloRios,07/08/2021,Very crowded in high temperatures but ideal to spend the night if you want to enter the park early or if you want to rest after leaving the visit.

115,1392051,3,Jsanch22,01/08/2021,"Perfect for visiting Cabárceno, next to a beautiful lake, the only thing that does not have any type of services, and since most of the motorhomes that go there are to visit the park and it is not cheap at all, they could offer something more"
115,1388271,4,Patata74,31/07/2021,"The place is perfect for visiting the park. Rather than the area, it is now a car park, there would have been more than fifty motorhomes the day we went."

115,1381197,2,winniefamily,30/07/2021,"Large area, but crowded in high season, where the smallest space is occupied, including not very late arrivals (noise of maneuvers). Practical for a CC (largely majority), but not very pleasant for a van (hence my rating). Can be pleasant in low season (place, lake, ...)"
115,1379339,4,guismin,29/07/2021,Get there soon because it fills up fast! the quiet and very beautiful place with bars and a store nearby! The raft close by to walk and plenty of place for a picnic! the truth is that many ACs fit!

115,1361590,5,balooui,25/07/2021,Spectacular area overlooking the lake. We have been 5 days in July and it is very quiet. With grass next to it and next to the Parque de Cabárceno. 100% recommendable!! There is a walk through which you can see the elegant ones. The filling and emptying services are disabled due to misuse. A shame We were about 60 cars.
115,1361387,4,VeckyVan,25/07/2021,"Parking next to the natural park, perfect if you come to visit it. Without water services but with a pine forest and a lake that makes everything more pleasant. Very quiet at night despite being at full capacity in the second half of July."

In high season it is always full, the rest of the year more or less quiet although unfortunately many people camp and make improper use of the parking lot."
115,1246001,3,LosNanos,10/06/2021,"Apparently it was an Area, however, it is only a parking lot. It has some potholes but the place is next to a small lake and some good hiking trails, right next to the entrance to the Park. recommended, but without services."
115,1243000,3,LosNanos,08/06/2021,"Unfortunately I have to point out that it is no longer a motorhome area, it is just a parking lot to spend the night. The maintenance of the clean point shows that it has been a disaster so they have chosen to present it and remove the poster from the motorhome area. You can not drink water or empty gray or black. Otherwise, the situation is unbeatable."
115,1241953,5,Alexi,07/06/2021,"It’s heaven here, lovely park land and a beautiful lake. Even some trees for shade."
115,1233539,2,Nostramo,03/06/2021,"The area as such no longer exists. They have removed the area signage. They have condemned the clean gray and black water exchange platform. People take out awnings, chocks, chairs and tables there is no lighting at night, total darkness. I do not know the ownership of the space if the town hall or the Cabarceno park, but changes are sensed and not for the better and our interests."
115,1231484,4,Ratoncitos,02/06/2021,"Spectacular site. With shade, in front of the Acebo Lake and next to the entrance to the Cabárceno nature park. No water can be discharged or refilled, it is sealed. On a daily day calm environment"
115,1226534,4,JonyAM,30/05/2021,"Excellent location, next to the entrance of the Cabárceno park. Ideal to wake up and go to visit the park. The very nice area by the lake. It is a pity that currently it is not possible to recharge water or empty sewage. The gray ones in theory can be emptied although it does not have an easy access. At night (on a Friday) we only heard a car and a motorcycle."
115,1224271,5,Chuecos,29/05/2021,Nice place and very quiet day and night. We visit Cabárceno park which is spectacular!
115,1222005,3,ValleCM,28/05/2021,"The place is very quiet at least on daily days, with very nice views of the lake and a very large space. The only problem is that it does not have a water filling service, only to empty gray water, which is a problem if you go there counting on you to be able to fill the tank! However, it has a nearby gas station, about 10 minutes away if it has that service!"
115,1217040,2,Paluda,25/05/2021,"It cannot be recharged, only empty, good views we were only mid-afternoon on Monday, all quiet"
115,1209215,4,loveitoutside,21/05/2021,Disposal and supply not possible! Covered with a tarpaulin. Area very beautiful!
115,1204997,5,JaviRT46,18/05/2021,Beautiful place and at least for a week that we were very quiet
115,1200612,1,JOSEMARIA10,16/05/2021,"People partying until the late hours, the tap does not work or the sewage drainage"
115,1198991,1,jorperc,15/05/2021,Bottle area on weekends. Much noise until late.
115,1190358,3,jon_koala,09/05/2021,"As of May 9, 2021, he is still unable to use the water recharge. Many co cars partying"
115,1181330,4,Openmindontheroad,28/04/2021,"Nice free parking space with Lake View. It seems like a meeting place for lots of local people. At Night Young people can make some noise but it was managable. Just a shame that the Fountain is covered so you can't use it. But there is a service area 9 min away where you can get water and release your grey tank. Overall I would recommend it!Enough Space for Campers, we only Saw Two other campers."
115,1180415,4,wanderloucos,27/04/2021,"One of best places we stayed for sure. We came back few times. There is a water fountain, but it is not drinkable. Place is huge and nice view to a small lake."
115,1179549,4,subetealpaisaje,25/04/2021,Today April 25 sealed water filling column.

115,1165004,1,Donjo16,03/04/2021,"The area as such is no longer an area. When we arrived last night we were surprised that there were so few motorhomes and vans. The water drain is covered and without a tap and from what I heard here from some countrymen, that this land belongs to the Park, that the Civil Guadia allows us to be there but if they call from the Park, they will either kick us out or have to fine us. a shame because it is a beautiful setting."
115,1163860,4,christiancastro,02/04/2021,"We have stayed here several times, always very quiet, the young people who meet here are no problem, everything is within the framework. Unfortunately, the outdated supply and disposal does not currently work, water can be fetched a few meters away at a Pozo, officially no drinking water. we love this place and always like to come back here."
115,1161743,5,OurTour,31/03/2021,"Our third time in this aire and we love it. The service point is in poor condition with no water, best to come full/empty. Elephants right up against the fence via the path furthest from the entrance. Access road looks a little tight but winnebagos use the aire so pretty much any size motorhome will fit. Busy with cars during the day but quiet at night. Good access to/from Santander."
115,1148421,4,ReneMaluschka,07/03/2021,Parking lot right next to the zoo and a lake. Very good for 1 night. It was very quiet at night. The zoo is also very nice to recommend and the animals have very large enclosures.
115,1131606,5,YouTubeCASASU4RUOTE,18/01/2021,Very quiet no water and difficult to drain better to arrive already empty of black / gray and full of drinking water great for visiting the park a bit dark for the night but very quiet
115,1112303,4,Lu_Ma_Tra,05/11/2020,We stayed here for two nights. There is water in two places (no drinking water). Cars drive past us and young people meet at the pond. Very quiet at night. Park is worth it :)
115,1111781,4,lufizer,03/11/2020,"Great place right at the zoo. To stand here self-sufficient for 1-2 days, it is ideal. The park is currently even open to a limited extent due to corona. Restaurants etc in town are understandably closed. Here you can make a good stopover. Even with a large motorhome 9 mtr and 7.49t no problem"
115,1104883,4,LauryAgudo,25/10/2020,"We have been spending the night for the next day to go to the park, a highly recommended place to go with children and enjoy the area and nature. The worst, the greywater drain is fatally high and full of holes from use and poor maintenance. But I repeat that the area is super beautiful with the lake that is crowded despite many motorhomes entering it."
115,1101901,4,jujocaslo,22/10/2020,"The place for motorhomes is very good, the environment is beautiful, the nature, the lake ... just a couple of things to improve, a little lighting could use, since it is completely dark and the water filling area that it is very abandoned."
115,1088743,5,xirilo,10/10/2020,"We stayed one night to enter the park early the next day. We arrived around 1 at night, there is no lighting all dark, there were quite a few AC. It is attached to the lake and the entrance of the park, the elephant area."
115,1082966,5,indie2020,05/10/2020,Stayed for one night a few over motorhome a. Popular with locals running and dog walking. Restaurant nearby which we purchased some beers from
115,1078208,4,txapu,01/10/2020,"A very beautiful place next to the Cabarceno park and next to a lake where there are ducks and a walk next to the park from where you can see the elephants and a quiet place to spend the night. The emptying and filling of water could be improved, it seems a bit advanced, that is why I do not give the 5 stars"
115,1073077,3,JaviImbernon,27/09/2020,"Ideal place to spend a quiet night next to a small lake and the elephant area of the park. The unloading area is practically unusable, totally left and without maintenance. Recommended as parking but nothing more."
115,1070407,2,McLouis535G,26/09/2020,"We spent the night almost 3 years ago to visit Cabárceno Park, and we were horrified by the loading and unloading area! This weekend we returned and it is still horrible! In fact we don't even carry water ... the tap is impossible to connect a hose, as long as you don't mind that it is the same water intake as the poti ... disgusting! A shame in a beautiful place where you can rest very well at night."
115,1067245,5,vanpark4night,24/09/2020,We spent the night together with a score of motorhomes and campers. Very quiet and spacious area next to the lake.
115,1067147,5,Javito1971,24/09/2020,"The setting is idyllic. Lake and wooded meadow right in the parking lot. The entrance to the Cabarceno park next door. A visit to the park is a must for anyone who does not know it. Everything is fine except for the water loading area (the push-button tap does not help at all) and the emptying of sewage ... The smell is unbearable. It should be cleaned more often and if we have to pay for its use and cleaning I would gladly pay for it. For the rest, keep it up (at this time we were 20 AC and 7 camper and there was plenty of space left over)"
115,1067046,4,Juanangarcia,24/09/2020,"A good place to stop for the day and spend the night, in this season there is plenty of room and there is no problem when you arrive. Nice environment. The only thing to regulate is the filling and emptying area that needs to be cleaned up a bit"
115,1066549,4,morenocaravan,23/09/2020,"To be at the entrance of the park I expected something more. Everything is a bit abandoned, the filling water tap is push-button and does not have a hose to connect, it has old, closed, old ice cream parlors. I put 4 xq it is free and we were very calm."
115,1065092,4,budisvan,22/09/2020,"Very nice and quiet place, next to the park and next to a lake. Quiet night."
115,1064649,5,soniaarenos,22/09/2020,"Spectacular site, there is a path to walk that you can see the elephants magnificent place"
115,1061355,3,AndreNut,20/09/2020,"The location is perfect for visiting the park. Very quiet with the little lake, although on this date you still have to arrive relatively early because it gets crowded (at least on weekends). A little dirty the water discharge area"
115,1061354,4,pipatravel,20/09/2020,"It is quite good, very beautiful lake. We stayed from Friday to Saturday and there were gebte but there are like two car parks and in the smallest there were enough free places. The bad thing that we couldn't fill the water, they have a tap without a thread like a normal fountain, people filled the tank with bottles, fatal."
115,1057031,5,TR13,18/09/2020,"I would like to know if there are many people in the area now. We went in August and we couldn't stay as crowded as it was ... If someone is there and tells me, we are coming this weekend ..."
115,1048745,5,agathapalma,14/09/2020,"We stayed 2 nights and it was great, very quiet and the super beautiful place with the lake next to it."
115,1048267,4,legcat,14/09/2020,"Very crowded area (we went in August) but on foot from the Nature Park. We only sleep, we do not use services"
115,1041856,3,kortof,11/09/2020,"The area is very good, the town of Cabarceno a bit surly with the caravans, at least that's what it seemed to us, but it could still be because of the pandemic that we are having to live."
115,1041010,5,Cobalite,11/09/2020,"A great place to go with children. There is a lake with Patos, Vacas and Cabarceno 2 minutes away. It was quite full and we were able to sleep without problems."
115,1039104,5,Nitt,10/09/2020,Huge area where we have met about 40 more caravans and campers. The lake next door is great and the Cabárceno park just a step away.
115,1037894,5,Timer,09/09/2020,"Perfect to spend the night before going to Cabarceno. We arrived at 11pm and nothing was full. Vale that the bullring had 99% of the holes around it filled, but in the middle there can be about 40 more caravans. And a little further on there is a small parking lot that will fit about 20 more. Peaceful place. I do not see services other than parking."
115,1035912,4,poqueque,09/09/2020,"At the door of Cabárceno. It gets full, yes. We arrived on a Wednesday in September around 8 and there was already little room. There is a lake with ducks. If you can park nearby it is a plus. Restaurants and a small supermarket 200 meters away. There is also a playground from the 80s next to the church."
115,1030803,4,Niculescus,06/09/2020,"Getting to a place like this and finding a push-button tap to fill water is a shame, otherwise highly recommended"
115,1028545,5,xantal17,05/09/2020,Perfect place with services to spend the night and be quiet. Great if you want to go to the Cabarceno park.
115,1028156,4,BertaQuesada,05/09/2020,"Many ACs next to a nice lake. Perfect for one night. Right next to Parque de Cabarceno, you can see the elephants from afar."
115,1022247,4,sonikka,03/09/2020,"Very good area for caravans, to spend both day and night. There is a very beautiful lake next to it. If you go towards the entrance you will see the elephants. The only downside is the emptying area, a bit neglected."
115,1021072,1,ToniGarcia,02/09/2020,"A total disaster, motorhomes in a camping plan with awnings and tables occupying two places, badly parked also with loss of places. Too crowded at 6 pm."
115,1017441,4,navarroivann,31/08/2020,Very good site except for the loading and unloading area.
115,1013584,5,Juhy,30/08/2020,Perfect site !! let's take care of it.
115,1013082,5,Anabotella,29/08/2020,Super cool place with a lake and at the entrance of the park. In the afternoon the parking was complete.
115,1005959,4,Suso72,27/08/2020,"Very good area to spend the night, quiet place with a small town nearby. Very nice you can take out tables and chairs and be with dogs. The entrance to Cabarceno 100 meters. Recommended, I do not give it 5 stars for the area of refills and very neglected water drainage. It is a pity that municipalities do not realize that motorhomes and campers are the future and they will take better care of us."
115,1005723,4,Emmaygerman,27/08/2020,"Charming place and close to the Cabárceno park. Good access, quiet and clean. Possibility of walking around the surroundings with views of the elephants in the park. As a downside, loading and unloading area quite neglected. As a tip, in summer, arrive before 6:00 p.m. to avoid parking problems."
115,1005706,3,txekee,27/08/2020,"Good parking, but very crowded. You have to go early if you want to take a seat."
115,1003707,4,jisjis,26/08/2020,Perfect place to see the park. With a lake and a large green area to take out chairs and a table. The only downside is the loading / unloading area but it does its job
115,1001825,2,Kirabonita55555,25/08/2020,Perfect location to go to the park. The service area sucks. They mess up a few in the afternoon !!!!!
115,996849,3,bdepablo,23/08/2020,"Nice area place, but fatal loading and unloading services. The gray floor is broken and the wheel is hooked, source without coupling ... We arrived at around 17 o'clock and took a good hole, from that time on it was already filled. Next to the park and near a shop to buy."
115,993144,2,orain,22/08/2020,"With the beach bars that some set up (I remember that camping can only be done in camping and private areas) they will soon forbid us to be there. If we want to be allowed to park, it is to park not to take out everything ... I would only stop if you intend to get up early to go to Cabárceno"
115,990823,3,elmonodelanasa,22/08/2020,"The area looks pretty good I guess. And I say I guess because I arrived around eight thirty in the afternoon in August and logically it was already complete. To say that I was able to park in front of the entrance gates to the park (the entrance of Cabárceno town) and we were able to spend the night without problems. Of course, in the morning you must be ready around 8:30 - 9:00 to enter. It seems a recommendable place, if you go to the park. The park is very very beautiful. Worth it."
115,985932,2,lolateruel,20/08/2020,"I mean that I got to this area at 1:30 p.m. and there were only 3 cars, and from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. it is crowded to the maximum"
115,985013,2,lolateruel,20/08/2020,"Place with beautiful views, very close to the entrance of Cabarceno, but terrible as the water services are, they should take care of these details since the area is very good .. today without parking problems"
115,984680,5,Misterlois,20/08/2020,Great and free area to visit Cabarceno or spend the night on the way. In these months there are many people better to arrive before 15:00.
115,982920,3,Viajerohappy,19/08/2020,"Perfect location but super crowded the water change area, better not go near it, it is truly disgusting, it is destroyed and many rental ACs that do not know where the sewage is discharged, clean the cassette by putting the tap with which you then fill the clean water inside the cassette. We went to the Liergano area to fill and empty. By the way a beautiful town that you should miss"
115,982811,1,Vimisan,19/08/2020,"Very crowded, filled and emptied is a bit disgusting, same tap for everything"
115,980911,3,annars6,19/08/2020,"Very nice place although too crowded. If you are looking for tranquility, this is not the right place. Advised only to visit the park."
115,980860,4,bill.murphy,19/08/2020,"Very good site, it looks like a free campsite. But very crowded, many motorhomes and families. Go early to get a seat."
115,980233,1,anuska501,19/08/2020,"The water area is a shame, with a high curb, shattered pavement, the tap does not use any coupling on the market, the same place for chemists to load clean ,,, with which it is better not to go to empty / load there. With the barbarity of cars that we are every day and the price (€ 96) x day of a family of 4 they should invest in the facilities and value this type of tourism :("
115,979404,3,ulletins,19/08/2020,"Optimal if you visit the park, but crowded and uncontrolled. If you want a place, I recommend arriving before 6pm, if you arrive later surteee !! He would only come if he was going to visit the park. Quiet night."
115,978187,3,Tommy15,18/08/2020,"I put a three because with so much movement of cars, it should be regulated (spaces, awnings, etc.) the water area is bad and you cannot load water without making inventions. It is next to the park and next to a lake."
115,976332,3,Sanxz44,18/08/2020,"Quite a large area, I estimate that about 100 vans. many sinkholes, somewhat uneven and the emptying area is horrible although it can be emptied and filled. Nice lake nearby, very large green area and elephants can be seen in the distance if you follow the path that borders the park. If you come to the park it is fine, now, to come expressly, I would not come."
115,972571,4,jordi_284,17/08/2020,"130 motorhomes, we occupied a lot of area but outside the area. At night total silence, with the exception of some AC moving between twelve and one in the evening. There is a lake in the same area that allows you to picnic."
115,971265,1,sergiochausson,16/08/2020,"Narrow to get in and out if you come across a large AC. Crowded, no gap when arriving in the afternoon."
115,967960,3,cazorlahd,16/08/2020,"Spectacular area, next to the park. Elephants can be seen strolling alongside him. Smelly emptying area, this aspect could be improved and if necessary it was paid"
115,966265,2,amilpin080,15/08/2020,"Very dirty area for the chemical, gray, water There is a platform to go up to drain the gray where some motorhomes can go down, even skid due to the pothole it has The tap is very dirty Very dirty area A pity, because the parking It is very good by the lake, but the water and discharge services area, terrible, with the number of cars that pass daily ..."
115,965732,4,inmagaji,15/08/2020,It is worth it if you visit the park but it is crowded. Parking right next to the park and you can continue to enjoy the elephants once the park is closed. The drainage area is a bit dirty.
115,964983,2,elixabetege,15/08/2020,"It is crowded, it is a very beautiful area, but it can be difficult to find a place and there are many people. Maybe it is worth it if you are going to visit the park"
115,963111,3,superfamilyonroad,14/08/2020,"Good place to spend the night before entering the park. It's very full, but you end up finding some space. At 10:30 p.m. we couldn't hear anything and we rested very well."
115,960253,4,Deivy81,13/08/2020,"Overcrowded, the loading and unloading area is very shabby and poorly planned. It's not that bad one night to see the park and that's it."
115,959795,5,VanLoverT6,13/08/2020,"Park area, very large and ideal to visit. It is advisable to go early as it fills up easily in high season. There are people who bring out chairs, tables... It's okay but always with respect and moderation."
115,955621,5,Bodhy,12/08/2020,"Good area in the Town of Cabarceno, right next to the Acebo, great to park the AC or whatever you come with, it has for emptying and filling water, quiet and hardly noisy and right next to the entrance of the Cabarceno park, the filling and emptying is free"
115,953133,3,soquete,12/08/2020,"Overcrowded area, 200m from the park, the place for loading and unloading water, shabby, one night and little else."
115,949669,5,maraguila,11/08/2020,"Very good area, flat at the park gate and close to the elephants. It gets too crowded late at night, but it is normal due to its proximity to the park, so many families with children. Next to a lake or reservoir the very beautiful environment."
115,942446,4,HeDelHin,09/08/2020,"Area for motorhomes, with a water drainage area and a water tap (it is the same). Gratuitous. Next to the entrance of the Cabarcenos natural park, they allow animals. Very spacious, with a huge lake (you cannot bathe in it) and close to the park's elephant facilities. The only flaw is that it is overcrowded due to the proximity to the park, there are many squares but it fills up soon."
115,942223,4,Yerbis,09/08/2020,"Good place to spend a quiet night. The times we have gone we have arrived at night, it saturates quickly. But on nearby roads you can park, and less surrounded by motorhomes. Starting at 10, you already have the cable car running, if you park nearby, you won't stop listening to it. Very beautiful environment, you can make routes from here."
115,936289,3,pamuxa,07/08/2020,Very saturated parking. The place of emptying of waters little maintenance and care when entering to empty that is elevated as in a sidewalk.
115,935368,4,erosales,07/08/2020,"Wide area but fills up quickly late / night. We spent one night, quiet. It has to empty gray and black water. To fill with water as well, but be careful with the tap, we had to use a universal adapter that another traveler lent us, it was somewhat complicated but in the end it was achieved. Near the park entrance. If they go to the park go early then there is traffic to get in."
115,933385,3,pamuxa,05/08/2020,Water drainage without much maintenance. At dusk all full of motorhomes.
115,931578,3,goribf6,05/08/2020,"The area itself is not good at all, it has a slope. However, a little further forward, in the parking lot next to the lake, you can sleep without inclination and very quiet. It is always full. The problem for me is that access to the unloading area has a ridge and is difficult to access. Furthermore, it only has one tap for both clean and AC. We have to get our act together at the town hall"
115,929627,2,burraco,04/08/2020,"Well, at the same park gate, everything else bad, super crowded, like a fair, very sloping areas, very bad filling and emptying area."
115,928447,5,david19751975,04/08/2020,Phenomenal
115,927717,3,befons,04/08/2020,"We arrived at 9pm and it was impossible to park, there were hundreds of ac. In the town, on a shallow slope, we reached two car sites."
115,922980,3,Maor,02/08/2020,"Perfect area if you want to visit the park, you are at the very entrance of the park but the filling and emptying services could be improved and it is very busy and depending on the time you cannot find space because people take out tables and chairs and they occupy several parking spaces, they would have to put a little order"
115,918945,4,lobosdemar,01/08/2020,It is well located. You could improve the water fill. But it is worth the place where it is. Walking you can see the elephants in the park.
115,915326,5,SantiagoMoreno,31/07/2020,"Area in the middle of nature. Next to it is a lake and you can see the elephants in the park. It has many seats, even so in high season it fills up at night (do not arrive too late). Right next to it is a grassy area where you can eat. Very memorable to spend the night, it is very quiet."
115,913660,5,Linarense,30/07/2020,"Perfect area to visit the park and spend the night, the service area there is only one tap which must have the adapter since it does not have a thread, it is the same with which they clean the toilet tank"
115,913610,2,benimar340,30/07/2020,Area bursting with AC and vans. It is not an area to rest in peace.
115,912203,4,emimomo,30/07/2020,"Nice area, right next to the animal park which would be a shame not to do. the least: old-fashioned water filling not possible to put an adapter for the tap so a bit of a hassle there can be a lot of people for emptying, you have to be patient. no toilets on site, CCs mainly arrive between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. bakery grocery store at 300m"
115,908514,3,mark213,29/07/2020,"Perfect area. The bad the area of emptying and filling of waters, in poor condition and little care."
115,908331,3,pedromouteir,29/07/2020,"It is a wide area with water loading and unloading services. the tap is to press and without thread pass in addition very dirty. the water drainage area is all broken with the iron on the ground in sight to puncture a wheel in addition to carefully leaving the bass of the AC. Two cars passed tonight to annoy people, screaming and making noise."

115,897758,4,JordiSerra86,25/07/2020,Perfect area to visit the park (highly recommended and can be done perfectly with AC) and to spend a night in a very beautiful place. It is right at the park entrance. There is no electricity.
115,896121,5,kukiraquel,25/07/2020,"Perfect area to spend the night. Very nice just next to a small ""lake"", with grass. Asphalted and flat. you can download and charge water. Next to the entrance to the Cabárceno park. also at 100 m. There is an area with bars where you can eat. If you want a good place, don't take long to get there, because around 6 in the afternoon it gets crowded when people start to leave the park."
115,895986,5,rpc01,25/07/2020,Very nice place close to the lake. Services. Excellent to spend the night.
115,893103,3,bouyoco,23/07/2020,"The site is very good. It is greatly appreciated that you think of us. Wide, beautiful and pleasant landscape, water change services ... but very crowded and worst of all, some are very rude and do not respect the rest of other users. The worst thing of all is that they give a bad image to the group."
115,890024,2,GemmaMQ,22/07/2020,"Ample parking, with plenty of shade. Next to a nice park. Very neglected water loading and unloading area. A lot of noise from people. If you want peace of mind, this is not the place to be. Right now there may be around 50 AC and vans parked here."
115,887325,5,cotines,21/07/2020,"The area itself is very sloped, better the parking at the bottom. It fills up at the last minute, but when they open the park a lot of people enter. By the way, if sewage can be emptied"

115,886849,4,WPepper,21/07/2020,Large well-leveled car park with capacity for around 90 motorhomes. Quite shade and wide green area between the area and Lago del Acebo. Quite quiet at night. The fill and drain area is in poor maintenance condition
115,878485,4,BlaBa,18/07/2020,"It is worth it for the privileged environment where it is, next to the park entrance and close to bars and restaurants. I do not put the 5 stars because the water change is in pretty bad condition and there is only one tap for both filling and the toilet."
115,873991,4,jorbassa,16/07/2020,"Huge site with shade but missing for sewage, but the town is two minutes away from the park gate"
115,873938,3,jacinta,16/07/2020,"Well located, but very fair squares, the filling of water requires a wide diameter hose and a clamp .... the city council also deserves applause for maintaining a free area with these services. very nice place and views .. quite mosquitoes eye in july"

115,859109,5,4xots,10/07/2020,Good place to sleep and visit the park. You can take pleasant walks in the area. In the supermarket they make good sandwiches and serve very well. In the only restaurant that could have dinner we could not stay to make a bad face when taking a dog. On July 6 we arrived at 8:30 pm and we had a hard time finding a place. A pity to see how some occupy two and three seats with their tables and awnings.
115,856846,5,titomon,09/07/2020,"Although the loading and unloading area is a shame, I give it 5 stars because the site deserves it. Spending a few days here is a privilege, and also free, so for our sake, let's take care of this place."

115,844465,1,seteymar,01/07/2020,I give it a bad grade because you can not allow the faucet to be shared to fill and toilet. For the rest everything very well.
115,844007,5,Valbu,01/07/2020,"Highly recommended. By the lake, if you take a walk you see the elephants, it is next to the town where there is a small store that sells quesadas pasiegas and very tasty sandwiches, hamburgers ... it is cheap and good treatment. Ideal to visit Cabarceno."
115,839178,4,cxsxgxe,27/06/2020,It's very good. I do not put the 5 stars because it does not seem very hygienic to me that the drinking water is with the black water.

115,751539,4,couto84,08/12/2019,"Highly recommended, quiet and next to the entrance to the park. Large spaces and capacity for many acs. The only bad thing is the state of loading and unloading areas, very neglected, dirty and mud, otherwise, very nice and comfortable place to enter the park"
115,742924,3,toledo,14/11/2019,"We stayed three days in August on this area to visit the animal park, for parking no complaints if you are parked along the pond very nice with wooded area and lawn but in terms of 'Drainage area is a disaster, obsolete dirty and smells bad, a single tap to rinse the toilet cassette and fill the tank with clean water !!!!!! (There is a little further 10Meter about a wash house that is fed by drinking water source but inconvenience must be filled with a bucket). Namely the area belongs to the animal park so I am surprised at the lack of maintenance of this service area."
115,738444,4,gusandjeny,04/11/2019,Arrived about 8pm and got one of the last spaces. Perhaps busier due to running race in the morning. Lovely spot and not too far from Santander.

Beautiful lake and sunrise then took early walk to elephant enclosure and was able to take photos from boundary. 31 euro and 18 for children to get into park. Area for waste was pretty disgusting, shame if you need to empty and fill up as just one tap. We did not bother. Great place other than that."
115,700628,5,Annaconga,22/09/2019,"We really liked sleeping here, seeing the lake with ducks in the morning is a great, good morning! We must arrive soon because it is very crowded, but it is something that gave us security, sleeping so many people there."

115,669658,5,Mamenfran,31/08/2019,Very comfortable and entertaining area for children. We change gray and black water and fill water. It is 1 minute from the entrance to Cabarceno. In Cabarceno you can enter with AC and vans.
115,667578,4,mixim2013,30/08/2019,"Perfect place to spend the night before going to the park. I put 1 star less because it was overcrowded. At the last minute impossible to find a place, luckily we arrived soon. A shame the service area for AC. Nor should it be the same source where Black is downloaded and filled with clean. It's really disgusting to see how the one in front of you rinses the poty with that tap when you were planning to fill. Of course I did not. Otherwise he sleeps well."

115,587090,4,robinboo75,30/07/2019,"Very good, but it's time to make an arrangement in the drainage area. It's disgusting to have to empty and fill there. If you go with a van and have a stopover you are very likely to leave it in the attempt."
115,581887,5,Fontie,28/07/2019,"Fantastic stop next to a lake and the safari park. Walk up the hill behind the car park and you get a great view of the elephants!, to be honest we didn’t use either of the water or waste facilities, but they looked a little grim. The park was great and a popular stop for people on their way to Santander for the ferry. Nice restaurant in the small village, nice selection of wines and beers"
115,579981,5,NuriaFC,27/07/2019,"Hello, the site is spectacular in terms of landscape. There is a very large parking area. Being 'free' the emptying area is just, but it is useful for a hurry."

We only stayed one night as on Friday 12th July a band stage was set up in the car park for some late night  music. We prefer the quiet. But the place was great. Didn't use water facilities just got out of there before the music started.
115,543300,4,IPalma,08/07/2019,A great place especially if you go with children and visit the Park. The water intake is a little complicated because the tap has no adapter. We went to refuel in the Lierganes area.

115,461149,5,fattivedere,20/04/2019,"We stopped only to fill water and empty black. Very close to the highway. Although it is next to the train track it seems a quiet place and is close to services (downtown, shops, etc.)"
115,458679,4,humauaca,18/04/2019,"Area recommended by the environment in which it is. Today is complete (and that does not stop raining all day), have had to leave many motor homes."
115,456747,4,zoejeanartsonline,16/04/2019,"Great spot, when we came there were only a few campers but it fills up quickly during the afternoon, also keep your doors closed if you don’t have a fly screen, a mass amount mosquitos will invade."
115,453844,4,chenon,13/04/2019,Very good plan for the parking we spent last night there were many near a pond and close to a large space with elephants. We did not use the drain. Thank you to the municipality.
115,433489,4,txinor,25/02/2019,"Area with lots of space to park and in a very quiet area, it can be recommended. people usually park parallel to the lake and eat a lot of place. The water discharge area is quite neglected although it does its function, however to fill water, the tap is common and has no option of thread or anything similar, so We left without filling."
115,421143,4,r9bert9,08/01/2019,"Ideal area for the visit to the park. The zone of the emptying of the waters could be improved, it is somewhat abandoned."
115,417189,4,davidfge,28/12/2018,Quiet night Next a lake with waterfowl and near the entrance of Cabárceno. Walking a little you can see the elephants.
115,415169,3,RAP66,20/12/2018,"In December, only two more campers were on the square. It was very quiet and we spent a good night. We did not use the service."
115,413421,4,sabrantho,10/12/2018,"Good for a night or 2. Animal Park next door and quiet location. The Guardia does rounds so secure. On the other hand, I confirm, draining of black and gray water possible but avoid taking water at the tap which is very dirty. Just above an old washhouse with an untreated source but drinkable."
115,411389,4,Gorkalaitz,02/12/2018,Perfect place and located next to the Cabarceno park. the only downside if you want to fill water is the same place where the sewage is emptied. I filled water in a tap of the pilon that is about 50 meters away with a carafe since I was told that the water is drinkable but not treated.
115,410674,4,bumblebussing,28/11/2018,"Great place to stop for the night. Peaceful, flat, overlooking a lake, lots of great walks, and a lovely quiet village (out of season!) The best bit is definitely seeing the elephants, bison and deer for free! (if you walk two minutes from the car park in either direction.) 
We did not use the services, they didn't look good. 
Great place to stay if you want to access the park also close to caves"
115,401405,3,kathrync,30/10/2018,Pleasant stop beside a lake. Didn't use the services as we'd read they weren't the cleanest. We did buy water in the shop in the town which was highly inflated. But you can't really grumble too much as the stop is free
115,399526,5,Tebi_design,26/10/2018,"Quiet place, quite flat and with great views of the lake. the entrance to the park is right next"
115,398109,3,lasarastark,23/10/2018,"It would be a 10 place if they made a small investment in the service area, because calling that service area for caravans is a bit shameful. The parking is good and it is wide although it is full and it can be quite busy during holidays, it is not a quiet place in the middle of nature, but to sleep in step is fine. I hope some organism wants to take charge of this area."
115,396480,5,SHORTYGEORGE,21/10/2018,"Beautiful place to stay, with a lake on your doorstep in one direction, and the elephants, a two minute walk the other way! You can pay to enter the nature park, but if you walk through the village, there is a place where you can watch the elephants for free. Binoculars help. The aire was quiet when we arrived on Saturday morning, but by night time it was very busy. I repeat the warning mentioned by others about the water supply at the service point. Make sure you arrive with plenty of fresh water, because you will not want to use the tap on site. We went to the municipal aire in Santander first, but it was full. We looked for an alternative, and decided to try this one, but used the service point before leaving. We are very glad we did!"
115,395966,5,pacey_uk,20/10/2018,"Very nice and popular aire. You can walk along a track and see the elephants in the park. Was busy when we visited so lots of engines being running before 7am, good for a first/last stopover before the boat home."
115,394584,4,ACPenedes,16/10/2018,"Area that meets all the requirements. The only negative point in the area of ​​services, should separate gray and black waters. Otherwise great, and the park too"
115,393098,3,katamarini,14/10/2018,"The area is fine. Although we have been a lot of ACs this bridge, there is enough room. It is quite flat, although in the service area there are costs and chocks are necessary. The service area can be improved. Black is emptied just below where the clean waters fill. We did not find it very hygienic."
115,392959,5,Helengp80,14/10/2018,In wild nature.
115,392958,5,Helengp80,13/10/2018,On holidays you have to go early because it fills up immediately. The elephants right on the side. Very good place in the middle of nature.
115,392236,5,Raquelreru,12/10/2018,Highly recommended Very good place to sleep. There is emptying of water and a source to fill the tanks.
115,381024,5,alvarobi,24/09/2018,"Parking at the entrance of the park. Possibility of shade and next to a lake. I did not use the filling and emptying services, but the people did. Ideal to visit the park. Shop and bars restaurants 1 'away"
115,374560,3,marano2007,15/09/2018,"Pleasant location, ideal for visiting the animal park. Undignified service area, absolutely avoid, damage."
115,368368,3,ClemoO,08/09/2018,"Very good to visit the park, otherwise simple parking with small lake (no swimming) small village nearby .ok to visit or stop one night, empty the day and full night and evening when closing the parc.securisant no problem."
115,366698,2,CR1516,07/09/2018,"Area at the entrance of the park and green areas maintained by operators of the park, we saw them worked. There is a lake with ducks and you can see the elephants of the park. This contrasts a lot with the sorry state of the service area for the ACs. They must improve that aspect that in my opinion deteriorates quite the image of a great nature park like Cabarceno!"
115,361869,2,satuco,01/09/2018,"As a perfect parking lot, as a motorhome service area, it was a mess, it was born with the problem of a single tap, which is not hygienic at all, but as it is now, it is not to be approached. A shame for the park to have that facility in that state"
115,360833,3,Kernowlad73,31/08/2018,"Very handy for the amazing wildlife park and plenty of space but whatever you do, avoid parking near the lake; we got woken at 2.30am by some awful boy racers wheelspinning almost into our camper; they then drove past with music blasting at 3am; a silver Seat Ibiza with aftermarket HID lights. The next night we tried again the other side and it was fine; nice local cafes and bars too. Mostly quite pleasant."
115,359183,3,mocha,30/08/2018,"Wide parking, many vans and ACs, the lake next to it very nice. We had it 4 days ago, quiet at night, although at 7 in the morning some lit up to leave the area playing the horn ... very clever yes.The bathrooms were closed."
115,357243,3,Ginodicampo,28/08/2018,"Convenient for one night, picturesque by lake. Few restaurants nearby. Quite noisy, people outside until late and arriving all night. Can’t comment on facilities"
115,351106,3,osakkka,24/08/2018,"Emptying area put on gloves, mask and boots. Very cool area and in August from 5pm it is full. Those who go with children be careful, the cars of the neighbors of the area go very fast through the middle of the parking."
115,349441,4,Javicamo,23/08/2018,"Although it is next to the access to the park, I think that the filling and emptying area leaves a lot to be desired. It was quite dirty and for all the ACs that had (more than 40), a single point is more than insufficient. The tap is not threaded and is an added problem. The managers of the park should give a facelift to this space."
115,347754,5,Krycho,22/08/2018,More than recommended. Quiet night very well accompanied
115,343909,3,alexandry06,19/08/2018,Large parking area. Filled with campers in the evening. Most people will visit Cabarceno Park where you can spend the day. The park is worth a visit and can be visited by car. The lake next door has no particular charm but the place is on and convenient for one night
115,341484,5,viviu2,18/08/2018,"Quiet, easy to get with AC. ideal position"
115,340348,5,jordi1331,17/08/2018,Very nice place to sleep very nice area
115,340084,4,manue29,17/08/2018,Very large area. Great space with lake next .. The animal park is really big and easy to spend the day. Rate 30 E adults and 17E from 6 to 12 years old. Grocery store in the village next door. Animations lord of our passage on August 16th.
115,332255,5,Fyrst,13/08/2018,"Of the best that we have found up here. In a beautiful place and next to the entrance of the Park. To stay several days. It has toilet and fountain, but EYE, the most unscrupulous clean the toilet directly in this source ... Unfortunately."
115,326177,5,fran_pascualin,10/08/2018,"This is great, we arrived at 22:00 and there was still room. now we are in the summer cinema right next to the parking"
115,325288,4,miguelfranco2,10/08/2018,"If the tap had a thread, it would have 5 stars :-))"
115,322340,4,inco16,08/08/2018,"Perfect the setting is nice, the nights are calm. Fun wildlife park next door adult 30 €, 17 € child."
115,315193,4,luisete84,04/08/2018,"Ideal area to visit the park. Green area with picnic areas and a lake, very quiet at night although it is usually filled in August. Area of ​​draining deteriorated and uncomfortable. The tap for filling has no thread and is a push button."
115,312380,5,melenas,03/08/2018,"Very nice area next to a lake and the entrance to Cabárceno park. Wide and silent. The filling and emptying area is somewhat complicated, as is access to the area."
115,311794,5,genesis21,02/08/2018,"Clean, pleasant and very quiet area in the countryside."
115,303527,5,kikebarreda,27/07/2018,Ideal to visit the park
115,298641,5,Frita,23/07/2018,Wonderful place! It is worth spending a night here even if you do not go to the park of cabárcenos!
115,298153,4,mialso,23/07/2018,"The car park can accommodate many campers and remains calm despite everything. There are just nearby inhabitants who are circulating. The park is a good step but remains expensive. The price is justified I think by the new facilities and the extent of it. By cons, side shows, I saw better and there is no translation, just the booklet at the entrance."
115,288525,2,padraigl,14/07/2018,"Carpark beside the lake. Spaces not marked so people park what way they like. Some people have all camping gear out.
The services are in a terrible state and the worst we have seen in the last 6 months of travelling Europe. There was only 1 in Italy comparable.
The Safari park makes it a 2 star. No excuse for services as it quite busy and we spend money in the cafe/restaurants."
115,288019,2,baba69,13/07/2018,"Attention to get out of the parking lot, we were blocked by the cars that went to the animal park because this street is very narrow. So we took the small road opposite the parking which is also even closer with low branches that touch the roof of the camper but it goes slowly rolling ..."
115,287661,5,jhonatan,13/07/2018,"Wonderful place next to a lake, quiet and many squares. There is no water to catch, if for water cleanups. ..... there is no WC."
115,282299,4,joanjo,07/07/2018,The area has a lot of space and is in an idyllic setting. On weekends it is full of cars and it is difficult to find a place.
115,277877,1,jupersan,30/06/2018,"the area very well, but terrible services, impossible to collect water, dirty and does not have to drain gray water (put a tap please that there are more than 50 motorhomes daily)"
115,277693,4,Jorlai,30/06/2018,Very quiet place full of campers and ac with a lake and a very nice meadow. without services
115,276390,5,lidiadelgadosan,28/06/2018,"Enough people but quiet. There is no noise at night, and if you walk a couple of minutes on a path, you get to see the elephants. There are a couple of bars next door for breakfast, for example."
115,275413,5,AdolfoGabriel,26/06/2018,"The first time we went out in the motorhome and the parking lot was great, no noise, it was wide and it was very cold there"
115,264918,5,freedomforlife,07/06/2018,A great place to relax just before heading back to England from Santander or Bilbao  or if you have just got off the boat. Only an hour or so away. Nice walk in the Village and you will see the Elephants in the Distance. A nice large lake to sit and enjoy. look out for hundreds of crayfish on the bank at dusk. well worth a little visit. The services are ok. but not the best. But its all there.
115,264112,4,Crazycampercatz,05/06/2018,Nice place to spend a night. Wouldn’t take water here as I’ve seen people sticking there the tap straight in to their toilet!  What is wrong with people?!?
115,260175,5,adriaplamerino,28/05/2018,Spectacular 100% recommended area

115,207696,5,sanesu,30/10/2017,"The site is spectacular ..... quiet and beautiful. It has white and gray water and free. At the side of the park. It has no lighting, but is hitting the town of Cabarceno and gives a lot of tranquility. In the village there are bars and restaurants. A great place .... the pond, the ducks ...."
115,207053,1,charlesyvette,28/10/2017,Too many people side by side for us !! And noisy!
115,204103,5,monetldf,18/10/2017,"A spectacular site! Right next to the entrance of the Zoo, is a place that belongs to the management of the Zoo (the GC was there and commented that it was not theirs) You can stay overnight without having the zoo tickets or anything. It is a very nice place and you can also walk around the border area of ​​the zoo and see the elephants and gazelles. It has emptying and loading area."
115,203945,5,Pplu,18/10/2017,Recommended and next to the park.
115,202498,5,josemacb,13/10/2017,Area next to Cabarceno. Quiet and with emptying area

115,197147,5,Pamin,24/09/2017,Fantastic area for pernicating and emptying! Incredible tranquility to spend the night! There are no streetlights
115,195893,1,Capucine,20/09/2017,"Crappy for the services: a single tap above the gaping hole of cassettes, see photo. Tap without screw, extremely hard to operate and with a powerful flow. In addition, you wade in a murky water."
115,190815,5,leglaude66,07/09/2017,Very pleasant area with a small lake nearby.
115,190439,5,vluisv,06/09/2017,"Fantastic place, especially if you face the lake garden. Supermarket at 500m. Basic services."
115,185622,4,CristinaLlamas,26/08/2017,"Great area I refer to all the previous messages. Beware of being late, there is no room for how busy you are. Only one drawback: the drainage of gray water is used as waste of black water and it smells fatal throughout the place, but that is only the fault of the bad use, not of the place nor of the infrastructure."
115,182718,4,jose2611,23/08/2017,"The area itself is very well has plenty of space to park but if you go to the afternoon is very busy this happens in summer, wooded area where you can eat, pond with ducks, area to walk. As for the emptying area some things could be improved such as removing the elevation that there is to access the emptying, put another water point aside only for filling"
115,173253,4,Fleff31,13/08/2017,"The setting is very beautiful: a small lake surrounded by mountains. If you want to be well placed arrive early. The area was packed before 20h, about fifty motorhomes. To fill up with water, a thieving plug is necessary."
115,173061,5,mercigd,13/08/2017,"Spectacular area to rest. Although there is a place, we advise you to arrive before 18:00 to spend the night and the next day to enter the park that is 1 minute away. The water intake is dodgy, wear American tape because it is worth no shot, you have to make an invention. Although the area is wonderful next to the lake, the services are very improvable."
115,170774,3,LuisaM,10/08/2017,"Good place to rest and beautiful to enjoy the landscape, you have to arrive soon because there is no light and it is full of caravans very fast and there is no place."
115,168299,5,jonatanpardo,08/08/2017,"Large area for many cars. They have free services and rest very well. It is next to Cabárceno park. In August it is very busy. Despite being late, there was somewhere. There is a huge lake and a lot of grass for children to play. Recommended area."
115,162012,5,Ainoa,31/07/2017,"Great setting for the night! We loved it, with a lake and area with grass to be with the little ones! Great environment to spend the night! We love it, with a lake and a zone with grass to stay with the kids!"

115,150180,5,JuanKi,11/07/2017,Idyllic place next to a huge lake next to Cabárceno park. At night it is possible to listen to the elephants. Only one hit. I can not find where to throw the black water. Maybe in another era you could.

115,133915,5,DiegoGY,08/05/2017,"Good site. The area is next to where the photos are. The water inlet faucet is a little broken and does not have a thread. Quiet place, perfect with children and dogs."

115,126947,4,k3z,12/04/2017,"Quiet place, well connected, free. It is right next to the Cabarceno Animal Park which can be accessed by motorhome (entrance to the Park costs €30/person)"
115,126469,5,cgarijo,10/04/2017,Excellent place to spend the night and spend the day. Next to a lake there is space to park and a green area. It also has a gray and black water emptying area.

224,2840833,4,tinmanwoodward,10/06/2023,"5 minutes walk from the beach, you will be closer than most hotels. Okay, it’s tight, anything over 7m and you will struggle but then it’s not for you. New facilities going in with a tropical pool, finished in July 23. Evening entertainment and it’s a camp site!!!! Toilets great. downside was the workmen had used the grey waste disposal for storing their gear. Water in Spain is better than the UK"
224,2835293,1,Filou94,09/06/2023,"Excessive price, especially if you don't use anything, swimming pools, sanitary facilities, etc. Very small, narrow places, difficult to drive and maneuver because of trees and branches. Everything like sardines in a can. What's the use of non-potable water on the pitch? Very difficult with a dog. No natural or green areas far and wide! Construction noise from the pool extension. No access to gray water disposal!"

A few long term campers but everyone very friendly. Exceptionally clean and hot shower and toilet block. 
We  paid €40 per night
Only 5 mins walk to beach and town centre. Supermarket 2 mins walk or there is one on site ( fair prices but small) 
Recommended."
224,2715627,5,frogim45,02/05/2023,"This campsite is not cheap but remains exceptional by its geographical location, its cleanliness, its services… in short, it is up to the prices… superb"
224,2704625,4,Saempf,28/04/2023,"The campsite itself was really nice, the pool and bar were excellent and the service was pleasant too. However, almost €40 per day in April was too much for us. You have to pay for the good service accordingly."
224,2701422,5,ChantalDidier,27/04/2023,Wonderful campsite. Very clean. A little pricey but when you see the services it's justified. 162 € a premium pitch 2 adults 3 nights water and electricity in a motorhome. Attention 2 nights minimum and camper no more than 7 m 50. Ideal location. In the city center. Everything nearby. Beach and bus station 500 m. 20 mins walk from port aventura. Brilliant what!
224,2693619,5,Stefaniefeichtner,24/04/2023,Nicest campsite we've ever been to. Paid 39 euros per night for 2 people in the van. But I have to say it's worth every penny. The facility is beautiful and clean. The sanitary facilities are clean and you see a cleaning lady several times a day cleaning up immediately after the shower. The staff is friendly and speaks several languages. Restaurant is great.
224,2686138,3,barbarazwygart,21/04/2023,Attention: only for at least two nights!

It is 1.5 km from port aventura. Worth the price you pay. We'll be back !"
224,2636511,3,KJFO,02/04/2023,"I don’t know what people are used to if they think this campsite is expensive. It’s a resort with all kind of things, so ofc it must be expensive than a normal campsite. it’s clean and a great place. I am giving 3 stars because the entertainment, food menu, staff language, kids club and literally everything is in Spanish. It’s 2023 and a resort should demand at least having English as a priority."

224,2101334,2,Loandkik,21/07/2022,"prohibitive price: 130€ per night in a van for 3 adults and a child on a “luxury” pitch (there was nothing left but that) in fact these are pitches suitable for CCs because there is mains drainage , water / electricity. Big rant because the water is not drinkable in the campsite !! Incredible !! so this location, apart from the shade (a lot) has no additional advantage. Dear troubleshooting"

Ideally suited for children, not so good for those seeking peace and quiet. The beach and promenade are very nice and there are many restaurants. There are no washing machines. You have to hand in your laundry at the laundry center. It is also not possible to exchange gas bottles on site."
224,1674043,4,JRM64,01/11/2021,"Nice campsite. Everything very clean and taken care of. Large plots but with many trees. The maneuver for a 7.5 motorhome somewhat complicated. They are 128 euros three nights, two people AC and electricity, a little high. The perfect situation. Near the center."

At least 2 nights ..."

Excellent and incredible treatment, on the second line of the beach, with a beautiful pool, incredible animations, restaurant in the campsite, showers and bathrooms more than clean as they happen to clean a lot of times. Lots of shade, beautiful receptionists, huge plots. Salou is amazing and this campsite with so much vegetation makes it seem like you're in the Caribbean. It has no supermarket inside, but 100 meters you have a huge one. If there were more stars, he would undoubtedly wear them."
224,634062,2,Edui67,16/08/2019,"2 adults 1 child less than 3 years and a dog = more than 100 € !!! At this rate you have access to a location where the trees of the aisles are not cut and scratch pleasantly your campsite because, not to mention maneuvers to enter the site. A campsite where everyone lives on each other. Otherwise the campsite, pools and toilets are clean. Close to shops and restaurants tourist trap, nothing very local in the area, unfortunately. Again unjustified especially in Spain!"

No mosquitos. Good facilities, really good, and plenty of shade under plenty of eucalyptus trees. Situated next to a nature reserve we were delighted by bee eaters and golden orioles in mid-August."
864,3150207,2,havana3,15/08/2023,"Camping 15 minutes walk from the sea free in August without reservation.

1007,3158903,2,joanes,16/08/2023,"Very exploited by the owners of the Area. In addition to charging 6 euros for the area, with dirty bathrooms (normal with so many people), they want to make money by leaving you alone in the parking lot outside and charging you. It is not money, it is the ways in which they have it. The place is nice but on these dates it is full to the brim with locals. I march at full speed."
1007,3148381,1,NathaliePlacido,14/08/2023,"Unsanitary motorhome area, noisy because of the circus or funfair, no safety and respect rules. place not drawn suddenly everyone imposes on the location of his neighbor. Mr the Mayor should impose a regulation, trace the locations and respect the safety distances, as well as the dog excrement which is everywhere on the beach and in the city or even at your motorhome door."
1007,3118382,5,mabilde,10/08/2023,"Park next to Óbidos lagoon and beaches. Outdoor parking costs €4/24h and indoor parking costs €6/24h. With the right to fill water, empty the tank and cassette as often as necessary. We spent 2 nights here with around 50 campers, in the outside park. Very friendly park staff. The park is municipal."
1007,3105990,3,ChrisTarn,09/08/2023,"2 large sites, we stayed over the road because next to the lagoon was full. Great location and I would recommend a night here, the only downside is they have one toilet in operation (for over 100 vans) and 2 showers, they also closed the female showers early. Perhaps if they left these open longer there would be less queues. It cost 4€ which is fair."
1007,3068573,3,NathalieT-L,03/08/2023,"Convenient due to its location on the edge of the lagoon and the services offered, correct prices (6 € for the night, add 1 € per hot shower). The downside is that it's crowded during the tourist season, the pitches are small and very numerous. We stayed for one night, and empty and fill the Motorhome."
1007,3039252,3,villambrosa,29/07/2023,"Nice area to spend a few days, very close to the beach and next to the promenade. Restaurants nearby. Natural environment for walking or cycling. (bike lane)."
1007,3024628,5,jmartland,26/07/2023,"Great value for €4 per night to park across the road from the caravan site, no electricity but still able to access all facilities. Situated right on the river with cafes and small supermarket close by. Came back for a second night at the end of our trip before heading back to Lisbon!"
1007,3004517,4,indina,22/07/2023,Good place to spend the night. For 4 euros you have all the emptying and filling services. The beach is next door and if you walk there is a beach bar. I recommend it.
1007,3004409,1,Stephane.c,22/07/2023,"Nice welcome but really too noisy. Far too many people, to flee in high season!"
1007,3001923,5,eunice22,22/07/2023,"First place where we ventured. What a magnificent experience. All necessary services. To repeat, no doubt."
1007,2998172,4,Yolanda67,21/07/2023,"All the services are good, even though it is very crowded and the spaces are close together. a point the shower with hot water"
1007,2984750,5,grapillard,18/07/2023,"Very nice, very warm welcome at reception, good atmosphere, quiet nights, clean toilets, on the beach, bars and restaurants nearby. No places with electricity when we arrived but ok for us for 2 nights."
1007,2981118,4,HenningJeuken,18/07/2023,"Were there for several days with children and dog. Pitches outside are slightly larger than on the pitch (no electricity). Ground made of gravel / grass, almost flat. Lagoon about 100m away, access with dogs allowed, but forbidden on the promenade. Playground right at the entrance to the facility. Full at weekends, during the week there are enough places in the outer area. Price/performance top!"
1007,2968556,3,bradhannah23,15/07/2023,Great value for money for only €4 purely because of the location so close to the water. Really basic facilities and campers are very cramped/on top of each other and it was very noisy very late into the evening as a result. Fine for one night stop.
1007,2959411,5,Neli81,13/07/2023,"Great place! There is the one for 6€ and right next to it for 4€. In these 4 € you can use the sanitary facilities and supply and disposal of the other place! It's official! Are here on the 4 € place and we were told this at the reception. Of course there is no electricity here, but if you are self-sufficient like us, that's no problem!"
1007,2925631,3,Worth,05/07/2023,"We were there in early July and found the pitches very tight. Overall, the pitch is not nice, few mobile have shade. So we went to the parking lot behind it. In the morning an employee of the parking lot came and charged 4 euros per day. Very convenient to use the facilities of the main square. Passage directly at the disposal of the parking space."
1007,2925194,4,jimneutron27,05/07/2023,"very welcoming air, with a superb place to visit, quiet to sleep. toilet and shower are present. restaurants and bars nearby... too bad no electricity for everyone but a super sun not needed."
1007,2897157,5,swanamente,27/06/2023,"For 6 € (without electricity) there is a great place right on the water and with clean sanitary facilities. I don't understand the negative comments. Don't expect luxury for the price. Some day parking spaces have similar prices. It is a pity that many campers park for free in the parking lot next to it and then come over to use the sanitary facilities. If everything is always exploited like this, I understand the increasing resentment towards campers. We were happy about the place and the beautiful surroundings and would come again."
1007,2883419,5,cyrilb7,23/06/2023,Super site with all the amenities for the services of the motorhome.
1007,2842333,5,jssc,11/06/2023,"Quiet place, the area has all the services, but bring a full fridge in the surroundings there are only restaurants and a small store there is no supermarket nearby"
1007,2811628,4,ademannie,02/06/2023,"A nice place for 6€ without electricity. Sanitary shower under renovation. A great ride on the Lagoon. Place a little tight, but it's nice. Small shops in the village accessible on foot."
1007,2791874,2,Marion70,27/05/2023,"Two stars for the location. Otherwise you are very, very narrow here. It was OK for one night, but definitely not longer. However, everyone was friendly. Half a plus to that."
1007,2788487,4,ChrisGew,26/05/2023,"For 6 euros a night with toilet access, a great pitch for the night."
1007,2787687,4,Seline13432,26/05/2023,"We had a really good night there with ocean view. 
currently, there's only one toilet open but despite that everything was perfectly fine"
1007,2775666,4,lalonde83250,22/05/2023,Great location especially if you manage to get a spot along the beach but on weekends like everywhere there are people who are not very respectful of the noise from 10 p.m. it's a real shame it only takes one but they are at home I recommend but during the week
1007,2754776,5,ReinerReisdorf,16/05/2023,"Generous space right on the lagoon. Standing one night in the first row without electricity for 6 euros. Supply and disposal super. Toilet available, but we don't need it. Shower still under construction. But always with pleasure!"
1007,2746631,5,RayH.,13/05/2023,"super friendly welcome, right on the lagoon so fantastic views, service area is new and in tip-top order, excellent restaurants and a neat beach around the corner, good wifi and all for 9 euros including electricity. Pleasantly busy on weekends."
1007,2732507,4,Miluvite76,07/05/2023,"Very good location, fantastic beach, in high season, very difficult to stay in the main park, however it is still a place to return several times."
1007,2720752,4,rcerisie,03/05/2023,"Lots of people on weekends, but relatively quiet the majority of people present are respectful, unfortunately there will always be people to spoil the atmosphere whether there are 300 or 2 on an area. Perfect location and friendly staff. thanks to the community."
1007,2710667,1,Lofoten2019,30/04/2023,"Never again! Over 300 mobiles, pushed and placed in the tightest of corners."
1007,2707144,4,Regndroppen,29/04/2023,"Perfect location, a small village with a small grocery shop and a lot of restaurants along the beach. 6€ without electricity, nice and clean area."
1007,2697115,3,dfx1,25/04/2023,"The only top thing is the location, otherwise little or nothing to offer. Crowded, only 1 toilet, no showers, brightly lit.. but right on the lagoon, very nice"
1007,2685360,4,CATHOUGEGE,21/04/2023,very nice spot if parked in the front row. toilets under construction. a lot of people.

1007,2670888,4,Dudoku,14/04/2023,"Campsite with a great location and affordable price (6€ without electricity). Only the toilets are temporarily not accessible, as they are apparently being renovated. Clear recommendation."
1007,2660478,4,buma,11/04/2023,"We stayed 2 nights in an extension next to the area, a great place near the beach and town, efficient and friendly employees, the toilets were under construction, otherwise perfect."
1007,2646246,4,Moreva,07/04/2023,"Great place although without bathrooms, €6 inside the area and €4 on the outside esplanade that is not dirt. Close to Foz beach."

1007,2634483,5,sunlightdelight,01/04/2023,Very good place to stay. Leveled gravel. Nice views. Great restaurants nearby and nice beach
1007,2634399,4,Anatole22,01/04/2023,Good value for money. A little noisy due to the proximity between the pitches. Sanitary not tested because under repair. Bread (good) available in the morning at the bar on the square adjoining the camping area. Services included all for 6€.
1007,2634396,3,Campingdicampingo,01/04/2023,"Large, crowded and relatively narrow. But with a great location on the lagoon/beach. Bars/Restaurants nearby. Currently without toilet/shower due to renovation. No hot water for rinsing. Value for money is totally right here!"
1007,2631113,2,geronimo83,30/03/2023,"Welcomed by the French-speaking hostess but only 1 toilet with sink for the whole campsite and shower at 1 € in a room being demolished and in a state for which I cannot even find the appropriate adjective, it is better to wait a few months for the sanitary works to be completed. We would have appreciated being informed by a poster at the reception, we would not have stayed."
1007,2623630,2,Northwind,25/03/2023,"Large, shadowless place, the many vehicles are close to the street."
1007,2611200,5,wilmaYsia,16/03/2023,"Superb place, we arrived for 2 days and stayed 10 days, the welcome is warm, we met people who come every year for several months, they told us about the sites to visit within a radius of 30 km. We will be back next year. 9 euros all inclusive in early March."
1007,2600817,3,BSchroeder,06/03/2023,"For 2 people 18 euros including electricity for 2 nights, a wonderful view of the lagoon and friendly staff. Attention, the toilets and showers are closed for renovation."
1007,2596385,2,Azanobini,02/03/2023,"At the moment unusable toilets and full house in the place with electricity. Therefore, only the places without electricity remain. Great chaos also for the work in progress."

1007,2592009,4,Lottad,26/02/2023,"We had three super quiet nights! Friendly reception -6€ per day/night without electricity. You have everything you need. Showers are ok, serve their purpose. €1 for 10 minutes. We felt very comfortable and would come back!"
1007,2586638,4,SevDav84,22/02/2023,"Beautiful area especially due to its direct location on the lagoon with a splendid view. There is work going on to fix up the drain and washing up areas which are old and not enough. Restaurants right next door, a laundromat and mini-mercados in the village 10-15 minutes walk away. The price is €9 per night in this month of February 2023."
1007,2585537,2,Jussis60,21/02/2023,"In a very nice location, but everything else is a bit so and so. The place is in line with the price, 9€ per day incl. electricity"
1007,2583057,4,VanlifeCat,19/02/2023,"Nice parking space right on the water - it gets crowded and louder at the weekend. A new supply and disposal station is currently being built, new sinks are under construction and the hot water showers will be modernized from Monday. Great value for money for this location. However, the pitches are more of a parking lot size."
1007,2579234,5,jaildede,16/02/2023,for 6€.....the top..sunset included
1007,2577773,5,marioZeuner,14/02/2023,"Beautiful pitch at the Lagoon of Obidos. With electricity 9 euros, without electricity 6 euros. Toilet and shower available, 1 euro hot shower. Some Portuguese are firmly here."
1007,2566956,4,Santolm4,03/02/2023,"Park just in front of the lagoon with Wc, area to drain grey water and cassette and to put fresh water. 6€ per night plus 3€ if you want electricity. Restaurant/coffee just outside with fresh bread in the morning."

1007,2553329,2,slocum,16/01/2023,"First pay area found at portya served equal. Water services for 6 euros. For electricity and maybe hot water 4 euros more. Only interest access to the beach located on the edge of the area. Village without interest except maybe in summer because the shops must be open. In short, avoid it unless you want to sleep by the sea, but there are plenty of other more interesting places."
1007,2551071,2,Patrickbarra,14/01/2023,extremely well located the bumper on the beach extraordinary view but for the rest complicated no electricity or water for everyone first come first served after for the price some locals stay 2 or 3 months later there is a large parking behind in stone without services picturesque village good restaurants nearby personal I pass without stopping
1007,2550362,4,Marge18,13/01/2023,If you want to sleep right at the waters edge with fab views and watching kite surfers then this place is for you. We went without electric hook up and can park right at waters edge.  Loos are basic (no toilet seats??) Some pitches a little water logged atm due to heavy rain.  Visit Obidos close by.
1007,2532943,4,EriRic,29/12/2022,"For an overnight stay by the sea, wonderful. Parking space is appropriate."
1007,2519905,5,Charliekiteboy,11/12/2022,"Spot at the top to fill up with water, electricity and take a small (hot) shower, the price is right. Glued to the lagoon, 5 minutes walk from the kite spot. The reception is pleasant and very helpful. I recommend that there are magnificent wild spots a little further north but without service."
1007,2509958,5,MarieDeGoriana,01/12/2022,"We have to stop criticizing. Indeed the toilets need to be renovated. Expected in December. We paid double in campsites that were not better maintained. For 6 € it's great on the edge of the lagoon, quiet a splendid view, fishing boats breathtaking sunset. The Portuguese residents are very friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be back on sunny days."
1007,2507205,5,mugje023,27/11/2022,"the location is great!! we overlooked the lagoon. When you are here you have to watch the sunset, so beautiful! plumbing is outdated but what do you want for 6eu?!"
1007,2497654,4,park4nightgisou,16/11/2022,"Privileged place, we were parked at the edge of the bay, huge area! But the sanitary facilities with broken taps, the water no longer flowing there, non-existent cleanliness……the entire site is not maintained at all. location is wonderful….."
1007,2490798,5,Bajonska,11/11/2022,"I've spent a few days here and loved it. Views on the lagoon are breathtaking, and the sunsets are spectacular.
Ana runs the place with a smile and she's buys all deal keeping good order.
Town's not too busy in November, but enough restaurants and shops are open. Enjoyed myself greatly, and will definitely come back. Thanks for the good experience."
1007,2488415,2,Antichrist,09/11/2022,Cheap but dirty and very noisy in the morning. Sanitary facilities closed at night. Good WiFi... that's it unfortunately...
1007,2461780,5,AnnieEmme,25/10/2022,"Spectacular! We had a great time and what a pleasure to sleep in front of the sea. A beautiful walk along the sea runs alongside the campers and everything is very peaceful. We didn't use toilets / showers, but we did use the dishwashers. There is a zone for those who need electricity and another zone without (6 without, 9 with). In the low season it is a true paradise! We will definitely be back!"
1007,2426794,3,patoune65,06/10/2022,"it's the second time I've come, not much has changed apart from the decent price of €6 without electricity, but charging €2 per day for a trailer is abuse. I won't be back."
1007,2425611,4,liamjlewis,05/10/2022,"i was just here, she said the shower is only open until 8:00 to 6:30pm

1007,2420509,5,Rollerteam13,03/10/2022,great motorhome area. The caretaker speaks French very well. The price quality is in phase. We stayed there for 3 nights and pi take the bus at the entrance of the aire to go to the nearby town. Top I recommend

1007,2339958,3,Ferdl99,04/09/2022,"Stayed here for one night. 6€ is fine in itself, but our toilets were closed, no showers, no hot water, no electricity. So you only pay for parking."
1007,2336493,4,AndreAraujo,03/09/2022,"Good place to park and stay overnight at a good cost. We paid €6 for the Motorhome. Lagoa de Óbidos is very beautiful and has beautiful beaches. There are several restaurants nearby, fresh bread in the morning and all services. It is always full, but there is plenty of space."

On the other side of the beach, there is a beautiful viewpoint with wooden walkways over the cliff. Very nice place. Filling and emptying, without electricity, 6 euros each day. Tb possibility of showers, sinks and manual laundry. You can spend a few days there without any problem."
1007,2284840,5,FOLGADO,22/08/2022,Very very good park I had another idea of the park but I was surprised. well worth it
1007,2277850,5,ToInfinityAndBeyond,21/08/2022,"Great parking area just by the water. When the main area is full there is also a second one in the back, where we stayed. It was quiet and not so packed as the one in front of the water. For this second one the price is 4€, and you can use the maintenance (fresh water, grey and black disposal) for free."
1007,2276383,4,Manolete80,20/08/2022,"fairly large area with services. €6 for the fenced part and €4 for one right next to it, large spaces and all dirt. right next to a very nice beach and swimming area. We have agreed that there was a fair, but the truth is that we have not heard much noise"

1007,2208337,4,Jmge,10/08/2022,"We spent one night, it was very crowded and we went to the end area that had more free spaces, surprisingly the night was very quiet, until at 8 o'clock they took out some quads and 4x4s that looked like tractors and the sleep was over. We did not go through the toilets and showers, since the appearance was not to my liking. the area has bars and restaurant. we will be back"
1007,2179372,3,AraujoTeixeira,05/08/2022,"In the summer a lot of people, noise and little space available. On the other hand, the atmosphere is very welcoming and everyone helps each other."

1007,2146125,1,camilandessie,30/07/2022,"Total bush! We were allowed to enter even though there was hardly any space to park. Everyone is literally squashed door to door. Complete mess! Pans, umbrellas, scooters, bin and everything everywhere. Loud music banging from every corner. Bathroom should not be open for use - door halfway gone due to dump. Mould and dirt in every corner. People acting like bush. Disgusting place! Avoid!"

1007,2121623,2,emiguama,25/07/2022,"In high season, too crowded. Like sardines in a can. The best, the lagoon next to it. Best places in the area."
1007,2119028,1,Markmetznbus,25/07/2022,"Just 1 star for location at the beachside. Highseason comment: It is just a big dusty openspace parkinglot with all campers side to side (sardines in a can!) and no private space and next to evening tourist activities. Facilities dirty and old, personnel very uninteressed and unpleasant. We moved on to the nearby Campisto Orbitur, in a pinetree forest, calm, swimmingpool, quiet and dark at night!"
1007,2094050,3,alexromano,19/07/2022,"It’s a very familiar place where you can make your stop to fill water and WC. Check the beach and Have a swim at the sea right in the back. Lots of family motorhomes but still quiet. We didn’t spend the night here, just a few hours and it was really nice."
1007,2089563,5,Denis-30,18/07/2022,"we did two 4-day stays, one in the parking lot at the water's edge, and another in the parking lot that is just behind. For the price and the freshness of the seaside, it's great."
1007,2069620,3,ptifilou57,13/07/2022,"The area is complete. So they have a large car park a few meters away which costs 4 euros a night, and it's the lady at the reception who drives you there and comes to open you. There is no service, no security but plenty of places. So to help out for one night it will be fine."
1007,2032102,4,mchlhffmnn,03/07/2022,Great place right on the lagoon. Price: 6€ Please note the opening hours of the sanitary facilities!
1007,2019669,4,scheina1605,28/06/2022,"€6 a night without electricity. First row sea view - a dream. Sanitary facilities, as has often been described, are a nightmare and closed at 7:30 p.m. today."
1007,2007707,4,hpoland,24/06/2022,Five star views but the facilities don’t really match - functional but old and dirty
1007,2002292,3,DonCake,23/06/2022,"Sanitary building as described a disaster, parking space is okay for the price best you take without electricity then you have some space. Good starting point for the beach. Don't forget to visit Obidos :)."
1007,1989980,4,JoseBicho,18/06/2022,"We give 4 stars for location and price. Friendliness of the workers and also the view we were entitled to. Negative points, toilets not very good, electricity is for few and it seems that they spend the whole year with the plug connected. Good price-quality ratio."
1007,1984409,4,Coke83m,17/06/2022,Top location find the pitches relatively narrow. but the location makes up for everything. One star deducted because of the sanitary facilities. No toilet paper and toilet seats are also missing.
1007,1982257,1,ValeKangoo,16/06/2022,"The place is a simple parking lot full of motorhomes, they are all elderly people who control every movement you make. They have little dogs that they have and annoy. The hot shower is only one and costs 1 € at the reception. I have found public and free showers much nicer. The bathrooms are closed both for lunch and after 8pm. I would certainly not go back."
1007,1949238,5,Vivian1985,05/06/2022,"Super easy place. Everything available at a good price. Quiet at night, bathing in the lagoon possible. Great for walking. We recommend this place!"
1007,1935273,4,IsaSandra,31/05/2022,"friendly staff, this area is ideally placed facing the lagoon, beautiful promenade on the beach, attractive price."
1007,1908395,4,NovemberCharlie,22/05/2022,"Busy in mid-May weekend, but pitches available. Tightly spaced pitches, but wide enough to give seating area outside Motorhome if required. Pleasant walks in both directions from the site along the promenade. Felt very safe. Would happily return."
1007,1899814,5,begil,19/05/2022,very friendly reception speaking French. place on flat gravel. The price is top 8 € with electricity for 1 cc 2 people. 2 relatively calm nights. fishing in the lagoon and beach nearby. place to remember
1007,1896121,4,melaniehardman,17/05/2022,Cracking location on the beach. If you’re there during the week it’s quiet and the facilities pretty clean. Tip use them first thing. Weekend was a whole other ball game and would mirror some other comments.
1007,1890196,4,cabulmer,14/05/2022,"5 stars for location alone.  Right on the beach of the lagoon.   A well frequented site, especially by local Portuguese so expect a lot of camping-cars.  Camping-car facilties are good.  There are toilets on site are tired but clean.  Free showers are cold water, pay extra for hot showers."
1007,1872565,2,maslex1975,06/05/2022,Lots of large motorhomes. Toilets were smelly and the building closed at 7pm. You can discharge water and toilet. There is cold water for washing dishes. The view is beautiful and peaceful. Great for 1 night and a day of doing nothing
1007,1857319,3,Masmoudi,28/04/2022,For 6€ we had no toilet. Sanitary building was locked. So you pay for a location with a view and WiFi.
1007,1808417,3,mabreizh56,06/04/2022,"Very good location on the direct edge of the lagoon. For shopping, you have to go to Caldas da Raïssa. Unpretentious but there is everything you need for a reasonable price and a pleasant welcome."
1007,1804047,2,klr40,02/04/2022,We drove further. It couldn't be any narrower. Literally trailer to trailer. The environment and the pitch are not inviting. The sanitary facilities are dirty and there are very few toilets and showers for so many people. Two stars for the price and location by the sea. It would be acceptable for one night as there isn't that much else nearby and it's better than nothing.
1007,1799150,3,faxbi,28/03/2022,"Very nice staff, but information about the closing times of the sanitary facilities would have been useful. 5 p.m. seems very early..."
1007,1797487,1,pauld123,27/03/2022,"Great Location, Terrible site. Tiny pitches (and we have a small van). Loud parties on beach until late. Toilets and showers close at 5pm and only warm shower kept behind locked door and Is a euro. Not an issue if you are told about the toilets and showers when you check in but we weren't and nor were others based on the screams from the cold showers."
1007,1789932,3,JessDen,20/03/2022,Okay for one night in transit. Otherwise tight and uncomfortable. Shower warm 1 €. Lady at the reception very nice.
1007,1787499,4,FollowTheWedas,19/03/2022,"Very sweet lady at the reception. All very basic, don't expect too much but a great place to spend a night. And also very affordable and in a beautiful location."
1007,1773912,4,renatavan,05/03/2022,"We spent a quiet night with a lagoon view for €6 for 2 people, a small van and no electricity. extra 2x €1 for hot showers, nothing fancy but okay. very helpful lady at the desk, thank you!"
1007,1772503,5,George1207,03/03/2022,"absolutely delighted, right at water's edge, good dog walks nearby all for 6 euro. We tend to use our own facilities in the motorhome and this type of place is right up our street, and quiet at night."
1007,1770458,4,thasti,01/03/2022,"This place has been an integral part of our winter trips to Portugal for years. We were pleasantly surprised by the redesign of the promenade on the square along the lagoon. Unfortunately, due to a defect, the shower could not be used. This time the pitches are much narrower than last year and especially close together in the first row. Otherwise all good and pleasant stay."
1007,1764638,4,bubunco,24/02/2022,Very nice discovery. A relaxing environment. A very nice welcome by the babysitter (who speaks French). Reasonable price. Indeed the toilets are not of the first youth but clean. We will gladly come back.
1007,1764081,5,bangiverden,23/02/2022,"Best place, inexpensive, great location right on the beach, several great restaurants within walking distance. Very helpful and friendly attendant. Bathrooms outdated but part of the place charm. We stayed an extra night because we loved it"
1007,1757617,4,Martinaelke,16/02/2022,"We had a pitch without electricity with a fantastic view of the lagoon €6 for a mobile home for 2 people and a dog is more than fair The sanitary facilities have retained the ""charm"" of the 80s :) Staff very friendly We would come again The environment is also very nice Nice"
1007,1747986,2,zams,05/02/2022,"The location was perfect, but showers and toilets were clean but not in good condition. Other services ok. For 6€ it was definitely worth parking and filling water."
1007,1735436,5,joao.1987.correia,16/01/2022,Fantastic location with the proximity of the lagoon and everything the park has to offer 6€ day without light
1007,1731596,5,Fredetpierre,10/01/2022,"Real crush for this place. How lucky there is an area with all the services! At the beginning of January, it was already well filled mainly by Lisbon residents in we. We paid 8 euros for 2 people electricity. Perfect welcome and location. you need a bike for shopping except bread at the small local bar."
1007,1715882,5,NatashaBOK,26/12/2021,"Stayed for a night (€6) one camper with two people no electricity. We faced the lagoon, watched Kite Surfers, walked the beach, and had beers at the local bar. Super windy in the night."
1007,1714919,4,Vingaardvanlife,23/12/2021,"this place is truly fantastic. we had an amazing time, the Laguna is fantastic for watersports, there is a good vibe on the campsite. toilets are ok, you have to pay extra for hot shower. The empty/filling area was ok too but there was a line of campers all the time we were there, as only one area for lots of campers. however all-round a really nice place, which we would for sure go back to."
1007,1714428,5,Hardy59,22/12/2021,"On our way from the north to Lisbon we wanted to stop here and stayed for a week. Everything is perfect up to the beach bars, where beer and wine are tasty and the burgers are tasty. The parking spaces with electricity are quite tight, which is why we switched (electricity, no electricity) every few days. There is no bread at the reception, but in the neighboring restaurant. Mercado within walking distance."
1007,1713020,5,captaindakota,20/12/2021,"Came for a day … stayed a week ! - 8€ with elec - lots of power for heat and cooking. Wi-Fi is great, kitesurfing in the lagoon at this time of year in a summer suit is fantastic and just out of the lagoon is an excellent wave spot, cycling round the lagoon is brilliant.  If you want a site for the kids and have all the facilities this isn’t the one. Lady who runs the site is exceptional :)"
1007,1705929,3,RotecGo,08/12/2021,"Everything as described, pretty close together, nice park attendant."
1007,1705914,4,HugoMiguel,07/12/2021,"flawless. everything you want in a caravan park. Spectacular staff. electricity some normal others three phase. the spas are old but reasonable, the floor is in earth but all level, with plenty of space for everyone, possibly in the summer it will be more complicated and the top location overlooking the largest saltwater lagoon in Europe. affordable prices. AC Micas do Jaime assigns 4 stars"
1007,1705018,4,Baquiano,07/12/2021,"It has the basic services and the location is unbeatable. You can park overlooking the Obidos lagoon, with a spectacular sunset and sunrise. It is right next to the sand, and along the promenade you can reach the beginning of an immense beach in ten minutes. Seeing how the lagoon fills up and empties with the tides is a spectacle."
1007,1692699,3,park4night72085,18/11/2021,"Too bad the electricity is only for local regulars, but beautiful place. Don't hesitate to go and buy grilled chicken in town, a little delight!"
1007,1684985,3,bluesman42,11/11/2021,"It's a park but does the job perfectly. I find it hard to imagine when it's full, but hey .... The area is nice, and it was bad one night. The 6 € is for 24 hours"
1007,1678528,4,AxelleUrbain,05/11/2021,We spent a very pleasant and relaxing night facing the lagoon. The showers are a bit dated but it feels good nonetheless. We paid € 6 for the night without electricity plus € 1 / person for the shower. I recommend
1007,1677652,3,lefloch,04/11/2021,Air well equipped clean friendly welcome only complaint when using electricity not enough space between the campsites because
1007,1641228,4,CatherineKenny,12/10/2021,"Fantastic location right on the lagoon.  People parked on the EHU pitches are packed in like sardines but without electricity there's plenty of room. When we arrived all the pitches on the front line with lagoon views were taken but within a few hours several vans had gone so we're now in a prime position. The spaces are a little snug but really, for €6 a night with all services it's fantastic."
1007,1633629,3,Snuugs0401,08/10/2021,"Only when absolutely necessary, even now very crowded in October - only those who are in the first row have a view, otherwise a 70cm 360-degree view of the next camper. Whoever comes in the evening (before 6 p.m. however) and primarily to take a shower - surprise, can that only be done the next morning?!? Overall not recommendable ... Camping to get used to :)"
1007,1579148,4,happyflo,14/09/2021,"Area next to a beautiful lagoon, we paid € 6, and we stayed one night in the first line, overlooking the lagoon, with all services without electricity, the manager is very nice."

1007,1492300,2,carlman06,21/08/2021,"A field transformed into a cc reception area but better than the area overlooking the lagoon and where the cc are all crammed together for services you have to go to the cc area on the other side of the road , included in the entry price at 4 € advantage of this area is the proximity to the beach and the magnificent setting"
1007,1456099,1,eliguerrero,14/08/2021,"We have stopped to ask if we can just take a shower, they have told us no. The site is simply a esplanade, without shade or anything, the right plots for the motorhome and a table ... Of course, next to the lagoon."
1007,1441650,2,cesarnicola,11/08/2021,It has a good view over the lagoon but at this height it is very crowded. Electricity points lower than the number of spaces for motorhomes. Dirty toilets and hot water pay €1 in addition to the €6 entry fee.
1007,1441142,3,tetellevan,11/08/2021,"August 2021: “official” parking lot crowded, the motorhomes are almost touching each other. Fortunately just across the road a field has been converted into a reception area (€ 4 per night and € 1 for a hot shower) on the other hand no electricity and grassy ground. Much more to the taste of our little T4 ;)!"
1007,1425578,5,queplan1983,08/08/2021,"Parking next to the beach, a lot of the place looks like a campsite from the amount of AC there is, some spend the whole summer, it has sinks and for washing clothes, it also has barbecues. € 4 without light"
1007,1316439,4,gambiermatthieu,12/07/2021,"There are two car parks, one facing the lagoon and a second just behind. € 6 for the 1st and € 4 for the 2nd with services included. Cold shower, toilet, crockery, barbecue, trash ... It's pretty clean given the passing world. If there is no need for electricity, choose the 2nd car park, you will be more likely to have a little more space. It's crowded but for the price it's ok."
1007,1311460,2,brunojrs,10/07/2021,"Apart from the location, I didn't like anything about this place. At this time more than full, as it looked almost all permanent campers in the summer. Camper to camper, you have to like it."
1007,1299445,3,laurapark4night2610,05/07/2021,"Great location next to the lagoon and the beach! It is very cheap but a little crowded! The worst, the bathrooms close at night ?? !! showers cold water!"
1007,1288457,5,OceanaCamper,01/07/2021,"Only €6 for a Van without electricity, but with all the other facilities. Just in front if the beautiful Lagoa.  I can imagine some days it can be packed, but we had a big spot and could sit outside. The beach is a jump away and to the village 15 min. Good place to stay .Nice place to kayak and sup. No waves and very flat"
1007,1272760,3,Majoods,23/06/2021,Inexpensive and a convenient location but bathrooms get locked at 8pm (sometimes earlier) and it's quite big with a lot of large motor homes some that seem to be quite permanently set up there.
1007,1269577,3,Tonipark,22/06/2021,"06/20/21 The place is worth it, right in front of the lagoon but the parking is outdated, bathrooms closed at night, cold shower, there is no shade, but even so I have been twice because the area is spectacular. I put a 3 because with the influx it has they should have it better."
1007,1262007,5,EsthervdAa,18/06/2021,"For 6 euros you have a spot directly at the Lagoon, including amenities, shower, water emptying and refilling! They are indeed not the biggest places, but for that you just have to go to a campsite... The area is beautiful. Absolutely great!"
1007,1260969,2,hasenteufel,17/06/2021,Not the most beautiful place but great beaches and the place is always full of Portuguese rappels. not all places have electricity.

1007,1246843,3,thefraulein,10/06/2021,"It’s a nice location, right at the lagoon. However, when we were there, it was super tight, very much like sitting in a can of sardines. It was very dusty too with caravans circling the place over and over again. The bathrooms are only open during the day. Hot shower is available for a Euro. You can pick up a shower ticket at the reception."
1007,1243339,2,moby4853,08/06/2021,"Too bad, before it was better, it was cosmopolitan, now the camper vans are mainly Portuguese and installed for several months or a year on pitches with electricity, a bit like on campsites. we will not come back to it."
1007,1225860,3,Diffygot,30/05/2021,"Excellent location, next to the lagoon. Quiet and affordable price (6 € 2px and 2 dogs without electricity). We went on a Tuesday in May, and it was at half capacity, so I deduce that in high season it is always full."
1007,1184321,2,Tschero,03/05/2021,"Welcome in the sardines-box. No toilets and showers since a long time. they say it has to be cleaned but since 3 days i cant see anyone working on it. one month ago it was already like this. they just do not care about the needs and promise next week, next week... i add one star for the location and the price. the service is bad."
1007,1150002,3,DiogoClemente,11/03/2021,"The best thing about this park is that it is right at the foot of the lagoon, it could be much more tidy and clean and have more points with electricity, because as there are few, everything is on top of each other. there are supermarkets within 10 minutes on foot and a great walk around the lagoon, ideal for walking or cycling. 8.5 € two people and a dog. closed spas, because of the covid"
1007,1133903,5,dufoureric,30/01/2021,"Very good for containment. Close to a store, butcher, restaurant with take away meals, laundromat, post office and bus stop for the town of caldas"
1007,1111946,5,noaneal,04/11/2020,Great location right on the beach / lake. For 6 euros you have a safe parking space and you can refill water and empty everything. For 2 euros extra electricity but were too late because places are limited. Stayed there on 10/30/2020
1007,1111216,4,fred4619,02/11/2020,"Passage out of season, magnificent view of the lagoon. No electricity in the pitches by the water. Ultra calm, we liked it a lot but we imagine that in season, given the number of pitches, it should not be the same story."
1007,1108242,4,thoka26,28/10/2020,"Very nice place, especially the places without electricity right on the lagoon. The only thing that bothers when it has rained is the place under water, there are large puddles everywhere and that with a sand-gravel mixture that is made of clay and therefore becomes rather greasy in the water. Showers and toilets are currently closed due to Corona."
1007,1107707,4,Catetso,27/10/2020,The only place authorized for motorhomes at the water's edge. magnificent view and reasonable price.

1007,1022019,5,susco,02/09/2020,"We went for one night, and we stayed for three. Perfect place to spend a vacation. All the services for the motorhome, although there is only one area to connect to the 220v network, and it is in high demand. Beach one step away and a very good atmosphere among all the people who were there. I wish there were more areas like this."
1007,997887,2,laurence3369,24/08/2020,"Very good geographical location near an arm of the sea where dogs can swim. We were placed in an adjacent parking lot which is much nicer than the area which is outdated, sad, not great! The toilets are clean, and the hot shower is € 1, the price remains the main asset € 4, the staff is friendly but I would not stay more than two days."
1007,993310,1,Familiacapela,23/08/2020,"If it weren't for the beach and laugh, I wouldn't recommend it. Single strong point and 4 €. Stay, but the park with very poor conditions, responsible very bad polite"

They put us in an adjacent piece of land away from the facilities with no electricity or water. The bathrooms and showers are open from 9:30 to 19:00. The location is unbeatable, the but is the only thing it has."

1007,862223,3,azabache,12/07/2020,"Service area along wonderful Óbidos Lagoon. Area with and without electricity, excellent location, friendly and helpful staff, but with great concertation of motorhomes. Given the huge demand, there is no waiting plan for those who arrive, a very negative note. Besides, next to the beach, in a quiet and much more peaceful winter.

1007,727088,4,Pinking,21/10/2019,"The location on the lagoon is good, especially if you get a parking space in the first row with sea views. On foot it is great the promenade The sanitary facilities does not meet the Western European standard, but we have everything on board. WLAN works great on the whole area, also fast. Electricity is only available for part of the parking spaces. Supply and disposal is ok."

In theory it costs € 3 to park outside with these services but when we passed by the reception there was no one to pay him. The site itself has nothing special, with fair and quite dirty bathrooms. Of course, the Lake highly recommended and the spectacular sunset."
1007,611037,1,AdelinoCosta,08/08/2019,"In summer it is a jungle, with all the busy places and shouts of children and adults, the places with electricity, are only available by wedge and knowledge, when someone leaves the place is already reserved. Summing up in summer is a place to avoid"

1007,575397,4,mino,25/07/2019,"Actually very large area of Cc and very reasonable price. Contrary to the comment on the homepage, the pitches are 5m wide and very well defined there are a lot of areas in France where there is no such thing and for double the price see more."

1007,559598,2,Willi_der_Camper,17/07/2019,"The location of the place is very nice right on the lagoon and the price of 4 euros the night is fair. However, the place is like a large parking lot and you are very close to the other campers. The toilets are very outdated and dirty."

A top place for us."
1007,476949,4,laikatita,05/05/2019,"Place to be able to enjoy the beach that is right next door. It has a beautiful view of the Óbidos Lagoon. To go to buy you have to walk a little more, the nearest supermarket is in Foz do Arelho, maybe 1 km. The only drawback was that the park was already full in May, and there are places in the park that do not have access to electricity, which has limited us in some way. Otherwise everything went well."
1007,474982,3,manouche61,03/05/2019,"The place is great, the area is a bit factory, out of season it must go but in the summer it must be vigilant with his motorhome, the entrances are not secure everyone can go through multiple places, it reminds me of worries that happened in the same kind of place"

But the town has no supermarket and if you want to go somewhere to buy you have to go to the next town by bus.

Respect to these people. We will have the opportunity to come back with great pleasure"
1007,240995,5,dufoureric,25/04/2018,"Very nice place, very warm welcome, very good starting point for walking, cycling or cars. On weekends, it's the Portuguese feast, smells of sardines and grilled chicken, very attractive and friendly, displeased to some foreigners. Renews slowly infrastructure. Small shops, butcher, pharmacy, laundry within 300 meters."
1007,234674,4,did41,08/04/2018,"Very nice home and place with breathtaking views of the lagoon. The problem mentioned for the trees is solved because they have been cut.Very nice walks to perform on foot, bikes, motorcycles. All shops 10 minutes walk in the village.

1007,233619,5,rvgoa,05/04/2018,"Always so nice to stop here. This year, the huge dune has significantly decreased and the sea can once again feed the lagoon and increase its level. Nice walk along the lagoon to the cafeteria of the sailing school."

plus side is it's cheap. 
€4 with no power or €6 with 4amp power. 
they have dump point, water, and a laundry line, the bathrooms are grim, no toilet seats, and no sign of toilet paper.
free cold shower or €1 for hot shower 
it looks like the owners just don't care about the place. wifi only works occasionally. not really worth it."

1007,180012,2,pio-pio,19/08/2017,It's a motorhome camping. Predominantly Portuguese. If there is no place they put you in an alternative parking lot next door. No more It is a camping but only acs.
1007,176778,1,Huracan,16/08/2017,"Go ahead and I did not even think about it, hundreds of motor homes piled up, barbecues and lots of people. Appearance of dirt, noises, needed light, but even so we left there we did not even enter, it is not safe so much motorhome and so much fire together."
1007,168999,1,Nath.jeje.bzh,08/08/2017,"Location a little creepy, not being used to motorhome areas, we have no point of comparison. Pay 4 euros to sleep on a crowded parking lot, with dirty toilets and cold shower. It's just in trouble, some places by the sea but they are rare. This confirms us in our preference for nature spots, better to settle on nearby car parks."
1007,167563,5,tom35,07/08/2017,"Superb place, very quiet night. The toilets are to be discouraged to sensitive souls but regardless of the view facing the lagoon, is all the charm of the place."

Second possibility pitches in the sun and without electricity 4 €. Anyway this place is worth it for the view the tranquility. By cons bathrooms are a little fair but have the merit to exist for the price and all services drain wc and gray water can fill the water. We will come back to it occasionally"

1007,115009,5,Toucanos,26/11/2016,"Nothing to add, it's more than great !! I see a negative comment because of the toilet (and yet it's clean). This is not a campsite, it is a paid area for motorhome, I paid € 6 for 2 nights (1 camper and 2 people in November, it's true)! Who says better, there is room, it is in front of the estuary, 5 to 8 m from the water, and who loves fishing is served! not to mention the wifi included in the price fast enough to have allowed me to watch French TV (with a VPN course) with great fluidity! I recommend and thank Park4night for making me find it. I will go back there"
1007,112146,3,farani34,29/10/2016,"The welcome is warm! Cheap motorhome parking and very well known to the FR! We are ""a little"" parked there, we are ""a little"" tight, but for two days it's fine! If the view is magnificent on the lagoon side, the same cannot be said for the toilets, which are best avoided! Another downside, no electrical outlet on the ground! The services are on the emptying platform which is all in all correct! Around 11 p.m., the noise subsides and the night is quiet!"

Comfortable pitches are suitable but avoid those close to the road (noisy in the evening and morning)."
1683,3249123,3,GarvinGarcia,02/09/2023,"We were in the grand comfort plot and it was not worth it, the ground was full of mud due to the rain, the maintenance guys had to help us out. Standard pitches are in better condition. The lake activities are the best. The bathrooms are unisex. We left a day early due to rain. The bar restaurant is lousy and very expensive. There was almost nothing in the supermarket."

We were very comfortable 5 nights. the pool and the lake give you two options for fun and refreshment. the pitches are pleasant with grass and some shade, although it will depend on the area you have.

At 11 p.m., everything becomes silent. Restaurant, entertainment, bread and pastries available. Only downside, hygiene of the toilets at the level of the toilet bowl. The edges leave something to be desired. Despite this black spot, good overall."

Sanitary ok, but was extremely messed up by guests. Unfortunately not separated (men & women together). Otherwise no one pays attention to silence (shouting at 1am).

It is possible to walk with your pet all over the campsite to the lake but we came across a man shooting the ducks! Hunting is therefore authorized inside a campsite! Scandalous!"

The procedure for using a washing machine could be made a lot easier (for customers and receptionist).
The area for campers to loose gray water and refill is small and badly placed. If you've a big camper you'll struggle."

Ideal with children because the price includes an impressive number of activities: pedal boat, inflatable structures on the lake, paddle, park, heated swimming pool etc. Festive atmosphere so do not take the locations near the restaurant (which is also great, lots of homemade things).

It also has a swimming pool that is covered and heated in autumn, and a tennis court, a petanque area (very French) and large and numerous bathrooms. The restaurant is also very good. Green, spacious, shaded pitches… We love it and we can't wait to return. You can go by bike to Saint Jean de Luz, and by car to the Seignosse Aquapark, top!

1683,898344,5,Oskarin,25/07/2020,"Perfect, a wonderful place. I have been several times, first with a store and now with fufu and bikes. It is a wonder to enjoy the lake with children; in summer they put on a giant inflatable in which you will die of laughter like “yellow humor” ... with free pedalos and paddle surf, even a little sand beach. It has a huge green meadow with goals to play soccer, volleyball or simply lie down and / or fish (watch mosquitoes at sunset) and also a tennis court and large petanque courts next to the sandpit for the little ones. The facilities are super clean, with good and numerous toilets and showers. Restaurant with good roast chickens and delicious pizzas. Some weekends they put stalls near the lake, including food-tracks, and a mini disco to finish off the day. Quiet place with large plots of grass, and just to enjoy camping, they do not have bungalows ... I think you will have noticed that I love it."

Arrived 8pm, was not allowed to sit inside even though there was plenty of space, then told menu not available, plate of the day not available - only pizza offered. After a 9 hour drive I had looked forward to not needing to cook. Then had to listen to local dogs barking (farmhouse dogs at other side of hedge) for several hours!

The plots have no privacy, and some do not even have trees. The bathrooms are very good, very clean, the showers are 10. They have a washing machine and dryer, the washing machine is 5 euros and the dryer is 1€"
1867,3268295,1,amni,07/09/2023,"Laugh at the hamster's house, we have a 7 and a half meter motorhome and we had to wait and hope to park it in the small plot, from your motorhome you can hit the neighbor's window to ask for a little salt, they take advantage of any space to get as much money as possible but you have no other option if you want to visit the city"
1867,3266915,1,lorenzolopez,07/09/2023,"A real scam, they charge you 35 euros, just for parking for not even 8 hours, without electricity, and the bathrooms, it's better not to mention them, they couldn't be dirtier. There is no security whatsoever. Don't be fooled, any side is better than this one."

1867,3247954,1,gertjanpriscila,02/09/2023,Way too expensive for what it offers. Small places The restaurant is neat and the food was tasty But otherwise not recommended
1867,3227981,4,Rupert_chapman,27/08/2023,"Good site. vehicles are tightly packed but most people staying are visiting the city not relaxing on site. Excellent reception staff. Large Carrefour shopping mall a short walk away. Walk, cycle, bus or taxi into town, we walked with our dog. You can drive and park at the city of culture. Only downside was the continuous shooting noise close by which scared the dog. But this is Spain!"
1867,3198460,2,marcadme,22/08/2023,Small campsite. Small plots that do not allow you to enjoy the outside. Correct bathrooms. Expensive. Well located to go downtown by bus. Very improvable.
1867,3190808,4,RaymondIV,20/08/2023,"A little expensive and small concern about hot water (absence 1 evening). Everything else is perfect, pitches on the terrace, trees (yes with birds in them!), an untested bar and above all access to the C11 bus 5 minutes away on foot to go to the city center without taking the van. Bus approximately every 15 mins, every 45/60 mins on Sundays."

Too expensive, pitches too small, plumbing not clean, electricity cable has to run across the street, so about 50 vehicles drive over it every day,... Unfortunately one of the few options to visit Santiago de Compostela, but I don't recommend it to anyone here On!"
1867,3144351,4,campermollies,14/08/2023,Nice campsite to explore Santiago. You are so in the nice town. Staff helpful. Sanitary clean. Only downside are the super narrow pitches. Awning could not be fully extended and you are close together. Nice under the trees. The campsite has a great swimming pool for a refreshing dip.
1867,3143670,4,AAMDGSM,14/08/2023,"Nice park, with lots of shade, clean bathrooms. Well defined but small plots with narrow streets (for large caravans). Swimming pool, playground, restaurant. 40€/night (August) for motorhome + electricity + 2 adults."
1867,3136630,4,PulpoDuck14,13/08/2023,"Great camping located a few minutes from the cathedral. It has all the services, clean and correct bathrooms. The only downside is that the squares are quite uneven. Super calm environment."

1867,3093837,5,chiara1012,07/08/2023,"A little expensive (50 euros for 2 adults and 2 children plus electricity), but a nice campsite with comfortable and shaded pitches, clean and new toilets, comfortable showers. Beautiful swimming pool and sports field. Convenient to walk to the center of Santiago (20 minutes), alternatively there is a bus at the nearby shopping centre."

1867,3049603,4,phrd,31/07/2023,"Perfect for visiting, very good sanitary facilities, friendly welcome, practical swimming pool (but chilly). Our pitch was long enough for our large motorhome, but a bit narrow and sloping -- recoverable with high chocks. 80 euros for 2 nights with electricity, normal for the region given the services."
1867,3045754,5,Marcossamil,30/07/2023,"Nice shady place with good services, a very large pool, just over 30 minutes from the Cathedral on foot, making the end of the Camino de Santiago. Great treatment and I was able to send something while I was traveling to fix the AC, they picked it up at the reception notifying them beforehand. Your restaurant surprised me."
1867,2983233,4,AlivanF,18/07/2023,As others have said a perfect location for exploring Santiago. The walk into town picks up the Camino as it enters Santiago. Stayed for a Pilgrims mass which was moving and spectacular. Even the small thurible is very impressive when being swung high over the congregation. Use the address of the campsite don’t rely on pressing the itinerary button. Pitches are small facilities clean.
1867,2936957,4,nohahaha,08/07/2023,"Very friendly staff, but the pitches are a bit small. Sanitary facilities are great (only the water can be very hot!). We walked to the cathedral which takes about half an hour."

1867,2922236,2,patval974,04/07/2023,It deserves my 2 star coach only camping in Santiago so too expensive 200€ 4 nights for a van 2 person and a small dog Out of season. And to spice it all up. Squares so narrow and sloping. next time I'll go the route.
1867,2919275,4,FrankyKaren,03/07/2023,"Functional CP 2 km from the old town. Pitches mostly under trees. Friendly welcome with all useful information. Online reservation worked well. I find 49€ for a WoMo, 2P and electricity too expensive."
1867,2902609,4,Weiersma,28/06/2023,"Toilet and showers very clean, as well as the pool (about 20 x 8 m). The staff was very friendly and explained and marked the way to us by bike."
1867,2897720,2,MariePondi,27/06/2023,"Apart from the good location in the city to walk to the cathedral and the very clean sanitary facilities, the price of 40 euros for one night is excessive, especially since the pitches are no larger than on a motorhome area: a advice when at reception they ask you the length of your vehicle add one meter otherwise they will place you in a cramped location."
1867,2878649,1,djm,21/06/2023,Only campsite on Saint Jacques and they take advantage of it on June 21 €80 for 2 nights for 2 people excessive value for money Too much is too much

1867,2811551,4,ManilaTao,02/06/2023,"Nice city campground. Price is reasonable for the location. One star less, as the facilities on one day looked like no one cleaned them and that should not happen, especially for that price!"
1867,2795120,4,BerndHarbrecht,28/05/2023,"Ideal place to visit the city, everything can be reached quickly by bike. Nice reception, places a bit too narrow and too dark for our taste. Price without electricity €29.50 acceptable due to the location. One star deduction for the toilet and shower"
1867,2790980,4,UrsulaHarald,27/05/2023,"A good starting point for Santiago, bus runs every half hour is about 5 minutes away, the center is also easily accessible by bike, nice shady pitches, friendly reception, sanitary facilities could be cleaner, but recommended for a city camping, we stayed here 2 nights"
1867,2761316,3,gyco,18/05/2023,"It is the only campsite that allows you to visit the city serenely. Obviously the value for money is not very favorable. Minimalist location, uneven ground, correct and maintained sanitary facilities but with access that can be difficult for those over 7 m"
1867,2750519,3,SilvioBondim,15/05/2023,"We were there in April/23. Places for gray water disposal, toilet cleaning and drinking water supply are difficult to access. Bathrooms OK in quantity but in need of some maintenance. Very high value for the conditions and location of the camping, which is a little away from the Cathedral. However, I recommend it due to the lack of options in the city."
1867,2748379,2,venturat4,14/05/2023,"€30 a night for 2 people and a small van. Uneven plots, dirty toilets, overcrowded bins... The washing machine costs €5 and the dryer needs at least €6 or 7 to leave fairly decent clothes.

The only ""negative"" is that not all the places are level, for a campsite I think that ideally they should all be level. In the reception bar they sell bread in the morning."
1867,2644409,2,Vito115,06/04/2023,Very expensive for not being high season. €35 for a 2-person van and electricity. They take advantage of the fact that there are no more campsites. Laundry €5 to wash clothes and €4 for a dryer. Friendly reception people and sunny and shady plots if preferred.
1867,2641764,5,Culogordo,05/04/2023,"Absolute tranquility, some sunny plots and others with a lot of shade, although some are narrow. Very friendly treatment. Next to a shopping center with cinemas and a supermarket and a few steps from the bus to the center. we will repeat"

I had a pitch at the top (513) with my camper, it's pretty quiet here - but sanitary facilities (ok) were 2 floors below. Place is assigned to you. Gladly again!"
1867,2373766,5,balade56,15/09/2022,"A campsite very well located near a shopping center, ideal for shopping; choice between a short 1/2 hour walk or the bus to get to the city center. Well maintained campsite, friendly staff. To advice."

1867,2353566,2,TomderBadner,09/09/2022,"First the positive. The sights are very easy to reach from the square. Friendly and polite reception, quick seat allocation. Negative: No free choice of seats despite many free seats, so they were placed very closely, although it would have been better. Toilets were only cleaned once a day, could be improved, especially when the weather was bad it didn't look inviting. Water for hand washing was turned off, that's not possible."
1867,2348190,4,Mbwa,07/09/2022,"Campsite super well placed for visiting the city, bus at 1 euro at 500 M.

1867,2328096,4,MariaKoala,01/09/2022,"The showers are great, although for some reason there is no hand soap in the sinks. Greywater area, etc. is fine too. The only downside is that the plots are not particularly large, but considering that there are many people being in the city, it is normal."

The places are very shady due to the many trees, but unfortunately our car was very dirty afterwards. The showers are very large and had plenty of counter space. The sanitary facilities were not cleaned during our stay."

We were told where the pool was when we checked in so figured it was open however after a long hike one day we wanted to have a swim only to find the pool was closed and filthy. This was disappointing but I presume it will be open soon.
1867,1935513,3,zachariah273,31/05/2022,"Pleasant campsite - 30 minutes walk into the cathedral square. Pitches are built into the hill, a few have lots of trees which make them rather dark. Facilities a little dated but functional."

1867,1740092,4,Perryneta,23/01/2022,"I slept one night in October. Silent camping, only vans, caravans and bungalows (I did not see any tents). I chose this campsite because of its proximity to the center (10 minutes by bike to the cathedral) and for leaving the van guarded for a few days while doing part of the journey (about 8 euros a day to leave the van, a similar price or even cheaper than some car parks)"

The technology works, but a caretaker would have to repair and replace it. We were happy to stay there for 2 nights. Bus stop nearby, but you can also walk to the center. Parking with camper in the center is impossible. A large carrefour with a large parking lot is not far from the campsite."

Absolutely stunning, you feel like teleported into a medieval city. We ate in the restaurant El Papatorio in the busy restaurant street near the cathedral, highly recommended, the food and the service was amazing. But there are lots of cool restaurants lining the street. For the way back we took a taxi, 6,90 euros. The campsite is quite small, in high season it might be better to reserve. Very nice bar and restaurant on-site, obviously popular with the locals, always a good sign. Terraced plots with grass, accessible with our RV of 6.30 metres. Very clean bathrooms and toilets, warm showers."

Somewhat expensive, but it offers a swimming pool, soccer field, swings, etc. Bus stop 3 minutes away that leaves you in the same center (they leave at and a half on the dot during the week) although you can also go for a 25-minute walk. There was construction in the entrance street that made noise from very early on. It was the only bad thing."

Staff some good some bad. restaurant excellent, spanish opening times which means you eat very early or late. 5 amp power 220vac power supply. water supply ok. €27 per night with electricty, 2 adults"
1867,752441,1,knaussudwind,10/12/2019,"Plots with poor drainage on rainy days (this is Galicia) We went on a weekend and we got tired of cleaning mud. To be a campsite there is no security control in Absolute. Enter and leave who wants. The staff does not leave the cafeteria. It is preferable to stop in the caravan area leaving towards A Coruña. And in addition to this, more expensive than those in the environment without offering anything. I do not recommend it."
1867,749258,4,audio,02/12/2019,Toilets are very clean. the showers were cold! the location is pretty good to see the city. 20 minutes walk .. otherwise much too expensive (20 euros per night off-season without electricity!) ...

1867,718461,4,RobnTrace,11/10/2019,We thought this camp ground was very good. We parked under a tree which was not ideal as dew dropped on the roof all night. Toilets and showers are old but clean. There is a huge shopping Centre across the street. We rode our bikes into the city Centre which is only about 3km. They have a laundry service same day for 8 euro which I thought was fa fair price. Would definitively recommend this camp ground
1867,705327,3,Asta10,26/09/2019,"Too expensive ! The visit of the cathedral is done from the car park in 3 hours maximum. Unmissable, small restaurants affordable next to the historic city center, visit and restaurant in 5 hours so avoid camping"

Arrangement on the terrace on the hillside: very steep climb, no problem for vans and vans, more random for PL. Onsite restaurant and shopping center nearby. Old town at 2 km, possibly accessible by bus at 200 m (every half hour).

3092,3265454,4,papounet44,06/09/2023,Thank you to the municipality for this parking and this functional free terminal. Well located. Quiet at night. It's good to have materialized places for camper vans. Everyone should respect the locations according to their type of vehicle.
3092,3099354,4,papitos,08/08/2023,"sloped parking, but very quiet. We have slept well. For the water, you have to open the tap and the water comes out in 3 or 4 seconds, a good stream."
3092,3067316,5,Virginiehobby600,03/08/2023,the places to the right of the car park are less sloping it is possible that the person in charge of the thermal baths will entrust it to us. free water and emptying (for water you have to pump) the night was mild we were 4 cc that night. the thermal baths are really close with a large picnic area.
3092,3035954,2,LORINJean-Claude,28/07/2023,"What a desappointment. The very steep pitches, and are not suitable for motorhomes especially since we are not allowed to put the chocks. The town hall has a clear conscience. If it wants to accommodate motorhomes, it would be advisable to reserve the cemetery parking lot, which is more suitable. It's okay for a car to lean over but not a motorhome. Please follow..."
3092,2983261,3,AmaliaLopez,18/07/2023,"Car park occupied by cars, without any consideration, having space in the rest of the car park, be careful that they don't lock you up and you can't get out. Great hot springs, totally recommended."
3092,2847678,5,WavyD,12/06/2023,"We came up here in the morning, after staying by the church in Ur below, to visit the roman baths. There were several large motorhomes, and the road to access is easy  Very nice free aire. Water worked OK. Would happily stay here overnight too."
3092,2847645,4,bertiebuggie,12/06/2023,Good Aire with marked Moho spaces. Free water and waste emptying. Short walk down to the Roman Baths which are excellent and well worth it. We had a peaceful night and a long hot soak the next day!
3092,2844442,4,Cali-Gera,11/06/2023,"We spent a quiet night here. However, the floor markings are too narrow. But there is more space on the pitch if necessary."

3092,2764215,5,CattinJ,19/05/2023,"We came because we needed water & black water facilities. All services functioned well which wasn't our experience at 2 earlier stops. We were surprised to find the Roman baths are a small outdoor thermal spa costing just €5.50 each and reaching 40°...showers and toilets inside once you have paid. 
Nice views from parkup. Bins provided.
Dorres is a beautiful stone village. Thank you to the town."

3092,2684039,3,Pimcakes,20/04/2023,"The outdoor baths are really great, hot with a superb view, it's really to do. On the other hand the parking lot you have to be lucky. Some places that can be corrected with wedges, others impossible. So we have to leave."
3092,2657918,4,DanielMolina,10/04/2023,Everything worked perfectly! It's a pity that the place where they have to park motorhomes and campers was full of cars. And that the place where to empty the Poti was full of excrement. I don't understand how some people are
3092,2618799,4,ReinerReisdorf,21/03/2023,"Nice quiet place, also for large mobile homes. Within walking distance to a small thermal bath/swimming pool. Disposal and supply available. Poor cell phone reception and very weird, hence 4 stars. But totally ok for a couple of nights."

3092,2561028,5,365puestasdesol,26/01/2023,Wonderful place to stop at the hot springs. There is always water. You have to shake the tap several times until the water rises.

3092,2534552,3,WilhelmBN,30/12/2022,The 5 spaces reserved for mobile homes are steeply sloping (chocks are mandatory) and extremely narrow (doors can be opened straight).

No difference in price either for simple access to the sanitary facilities or for spending the day on the site! So… might as well take advantage of the site?. Massages on site if you are lucky enough to have availability. Pretty simple village with a restaurant bar. No opinion on the untested restaurant.

Site is being improved with the addition of new cabin/lodges and toilet facilities.  unfortunately these are closed when campsite is not busy and you may need to use the old central facilities.

Unfortunately we have to deduct a star because we didn't feel welcome in the restaurant. The paella was cold with no bread. The pizza and all the dishes should probably come from the freezer. A pity!

3515,1665457,2,KatiaRdz,28/10/2021,Noisy campsite too close to the road currently under construction the noise of trucks all night. Not to mention stray cats and dogs not kept on a leash. Too expensive for the facilities.
3515,1563680,2,SilviaMarBal,09/09/2021,"Camping near Pamplona, but next to the highway, so you have to choose the plot carefully, so as not to have to hear the trucks and cars go by ALL night ... In addition, the plot that we had was so small, that We could hardly fit the van and a table. The showers were so basic that they only had a hook to hang clothes. Nothing more. It is not worth the € 24 they charged us."

On the other hand, the area was overloaded with vans parked haphazardly even if it meant taking 3 places once parked across and spreading out all the equipment of the small camper. A dog barked all night and woke up at 7:30 as soon as some started their day."

3651,2969563,4,jneu02,15/07/2023,"The shape of the car park means that there is a lot of wasted space, and depending on how the others are parked, you sometimes have to do a lot of maneuvering to successfully settle in. Also watch out for the remains of cherries that litter the ground: in July, it looks like chewing gum and we fill the truck with it!! Otherwise pretty area, quiet and close to the castle, perfect!"

3651,2902704,4,aj79,28/06/2023,"perfect for a stopover when returning to or leaving Portugal free services, no electricity old town in 15 minutes on foot at the foot of the castle on June 27 few people in the parking lot parking on 3 levels flat ground at the bottom, a little sloping at the top no place delimitation so parking at the whim of everyone unlike other years we did not hear the barking"
3651,2899420,3,inespombo,27/06/2023,"Ok for one night. “Near” the city under a beautiful castle. No shade, a bit cramped but ok for medium/small Campera. Good view. At night an unpleasant smell because of the WWTP"

3651,2896227,2,philou47,26/06/2023,"Not calm at all, dogs barking constantly. The parking lot is near the sewer station and besides the constant noise of the engines, smells of stench reach the motorhome. No shade and you have to take out the wedges. In short, I don't have a good memory of it. 2 stars for water and drain services."
3651,2886322,3,RubenhFisio,24/06/2023,Near the center. Next to a park with people who didn't give me much confidence either. Water and containers. For one or two specific nights it is fine.

The only downside is that despite having plenty of places, it is quite crowded. We arrived late (we came on a trip) we caught the last seats and it was a Thursday. I imagine that on weekends and holidays it will be impossible."

Citadel Right in front, worth a walk. To put a hitch, it is a bit inclined, it depends on the area you wear and whether or not you wear the shoes… .. hehe."
3651,2648259,3,deserteagle,07/04/2023,"Probably a nice aire if your visit is during a weekday and not a public holiday.

No luck when I arrived on November 16, the gray / black water drainage area was not accessible due to work, so the taps for the water intake were also difficult to access. The place is pretty and relatively quiet although in town at the foot of the castle."

A beautiful scenery around, and since it's built on different tiers you more likely don't only feel like being parked. Because of the trees and some narrow parts it could be indeed a bit tricky for a very long camper, we saw some maneuvering around."

However, the children's pools are currently being renovated. The only thing we would have as a comment: there is only one wet area for all campers, which is large, but at peak times you have to queue for your shower and it gets moldy over the showers because there are probably no possibilities for ventilation or the ones for it built-in system is probably broken."

4039,247355,4,marcangouleme,06/05/2018,"Superb campsite located 2 steps from the beach (3 minutes walk) and 2km from the center of the historic city by taking the seafront promenade. The municipal covered market is worth the detour considering the prices charged at local merchants. The campsite has a mini-supermarket, a swimming pool and a restaurant. The pitches are quite large, equipped with water and electricity and the toilets are in a state of remarkable cleanliness. The icing on the cake, for those who do not like to brew their ""poo box"", an automaton, for 1 euro, empties you, cleans your cassette and returns it with the chemical ready for immediate use. Be careful though the GPS coordinates indicated on Park4nigt, they are false and send you in the middle of the sea (error reported at the reception)."

The staff is the friendliest we have found so far, very clean and the plots for the camper were very large and we saw that for the motorhomes that were parked as well. It is quiet (at least at this time) and they have security, also very friendly and attentive. Without a doubt if we pass through this area, we will return, highly recommended."

Given the lack of space, it's complicated in the morning, especially since everyone is waiting to drain. The mayor should pass by and realize that a cc takes the 2 sockets, and seems to have settled in for the winter given the unpacking around and under his vehicle It is well worth chasing ccs in town"
4273,3154695,1,beninenas,15/08/2023,"Awful. The entry barrier open. The entire area and the exit barrier does not open. After paying to get out, unable to park, they don't give you a code to get out.

Arrived at 11:45 p.m. a mini place to sleep after 500km from Spain. The barriers were lifted, maybe a generosity of the town hall badly sandstone a little month that you had to go get your ticket I don't know or from 5 p.m., otherwise the barriers would be closed, town hall which banished us to the depths of the city , where travelers are surely better treated."
4273,2957955,5,pilote33,13/07/2023,"Very nice motorhome area. Flat overall, tarred. Good value for money. In the immediate vicinity of the town center and the beach, tourist office and casino."

4273,2487668,1,kmllm,08/11/2022,We spent 2 days on the area. the terminal does not work. 10 euros per day is a little expensive especially q after a walk in broad daylight we found our motorhome broken up with the theft of our personal effects. Be careful in this area. Watch out for thieves.
4273,2480664,1,SunLin,03/11/2022,"Attention: the machine works according to winter time, the terminal for the code for entry and exit according to summer time, ie you only have 23 hours instead of 24 hours. We had to stay for the night from 2./3.11. pay twice for 24h (20€). You can't do a camper service either, although you have the ticket with you once. Too expensive without services, but unfortunately few alternatives in Hendaye."
4273,2447432,2,TXIKIT,16/10/2022,"The area is increasingly neglected, they no longer take care of the gardens, and the biggest surprise is when you go to change the water, you cannot refill or clean the potty, the water machine does not work but... the 10 € daily they continue to charge them."
4273,2410023,1,Rando-54,28/09/2022,"So there is the bouquet! The municipality despises motorhome tourists to such an extent by reserving a closed ""enclosure"" for them opposite the station, and this for years! You have to pay €10 to sleep here in poor conditions on a sloping parking lot. The terminal is still HS and the Tourist Office contacted promises without result to reopen the water. Changes are always possible."

4273,1471308,1,manounette16,17/08/2021,The area looks clean. But unusable! The terminal does not work. Motorhome operators are lining up. No support!
4273,1464185,4,Drakkarvan,16/08/2021,"Sleeped 1 night August 11, 2021. Correct bitumen area for the price 10eur for 24 hours 10 min of water. Possibility of emptying. 2 electrical branches on the terminal (accessible I believe with the entry code). Area in full sun. In front of the train station. Garbage cans nearby. 10 minutes from the beach (the return will be a nice climb)."
4273,1449907,1,mamasurfer,13/08/2021,"Very small, we tried 2 times to get in. No help at all, no support centre. We can’t work out how to get electricity. Horrible walk to the beach and to the town centre specifically if you have kids, no side walk and cars go very fast. No RV parking in the town, looks we are not welcome by this town."

4273,1346144,3,ChristopheEtKarine,21/07/2021,"Location certainly not very atypical, but it has the merit of existing and being inexpensive, close to the beach 10 minutes on foot a few places or even access to a little lawn, the trains are not disturbing because there are not many and the road does not travel much at night in the end it is often even quieter than a minimum campsite 3 times more expensive"
4273,1340131,3,jadesaint,19/07/2021,"A place that is certainly not attractive, but the campsite is pleasant and we are not on top of each other. The place is quite calm although there is the train station. Well served by bus and Hendaye beach is 800m away on foot. The price remains reasonable although the services are a bit light. In any case, in the city there is little room for CCs in high season."

4273,1220295,3,Parkifrane,27/05/2021,"A bit expensive for just 1 hour of electricity and 10 minutes of water, but, apart from the few trains, it's still a good place to spend a night, for lack of anything better."

And it is impossible, because the flow of the drinking water tap is so low that it hardly allows to obtain more than 70L and that is a pity. The municipality of Hendaye is responsible for this terminal."

We chose to spend the night just to visit the castle not far away the next day. A little expensive for what it is. 10 € / 24 h / 1h electricity / 100 l / water."

PS: the friendliness of the French Basques is deplorable!!! Tell them that they occupy a camper place, you will see how much they like tourists. Don't forget that tourism keeps your region alive. Never had this problem with Spaniards."

4333,3156626,2,joc,16/08/2023,"arrived in the evening and same observation here, motorhomes who think only of themselves and leave too much space between two vehicles which reduces the number of places, I call that selfishness. the next day the cars park in the parking lot and the cc people complain but there is no place where there is a sign reserved for the cc."

The parking for the bigger motorhomes was very full. The garage & shopping area above is very odd. We arrived late, and all was shut. It was peaceful except that the shopping area has a security concierge with a dog that kept barking."

4333,869024,4,RJ,14/07/2020,I confirm the previous statements. Nice parking lot with a little slope. Beautiful environment. The small petrol station located at the crossroads makes gas oil cheaper than Avia .....

4333,103185,4,chrisomz,05/09/2016,Just arrive at the right time to have room. Another advantage is that gasoline is less expensive than in France and shops (ventas) are open on Sundays .... valid especially for alcohol and local products. A nice walk to the lake (2h45) and very quiet at night
4333,100694,4,pctubbie,27/08/2016,Nice area where we just parked the day story to supply us with serrano chorizo ham lomo etc ... Problem the panel camper parking was dismantled by whom? so parking invaded by cars and galley to park

It avoids being crowded with the big white people who are on top of each other. Tranquility assured and breathtaking views of Saint Jean de Luz and the Atlantic coast in good weather. In addition you are at the start of hiking for the more athletic. Otherwise you can do your shopping at the Spanish rate, although the prices are very variable depending on the wind :) long live the tourists."

4333,2259,5,farigoule5,04/10/2012,"A splendor once parked, in the background of the ocean and around the mountain and the clink of sheep bells. Quiet and clean air. In addition a least expensive gas station since Spanish and shopping center for the races. Be careful though because if the emptying is free, however for water it is necessary to take a token at the gas station only which costs 3 € per 100 l of water. But it's cheap to pay for this dream place."
4607,3227414,4,mary_cadiz,27/08/2023,"Very good camping on the beach!!!!. We stayed in the CamperArea part (a little further from the main part but the most economical: €41.50 for two people, fixed light van). The other plots cost 60-something and the electricity depending on what you consume... The only drawback is that the toilets are closer to where we were... they left something to be desired... the others were much better (renovated)"
4607,3206233,5,AlvaroRS,23/08/2023,Very good location by the sea. Great size pitches. The Kikoport restaurant is very good and the bathrooms have been renovated.
4607,3004834,5,JulienMartinez,23/07/2023,Magnificent little campsite on the shores of the Mediterranean (just the dune to pass via a pretty little wooden staircase). a bit expensive in the summer but the pitches are large the toilets are nearby as well as the washing-up area. I recommend without problem.

4607,2576380,3,HeikeXLI,13/02/2023,"This place is right on the water only separated by a wall. That's it for the perks. 62.24 for two nights despite ACSI. Water in the shower almost cold, the room cold, no shelf for things or shower gel. We won't be back"
4607,2540640,5,AnjaVerstichelen,04/01/2023,super nice and quiet campsite out of season. Small market at the campsite as well as a brasserie. Awesome!
4607,2506399,3,Inestosi,26/11/2022,"Actually a nice place, but they have raised the prices properly, are here for the second time. Now costs €25.50 with Acsi in November for 2 adults and a dog. Do not think that we will come here again for this price, the infrastructure is missing here all around. The only advantage is the proximity to the sea."
4607,2497938,3,Rimantasb4,17/11/2022,"Overpriced. The shower buttons didn't work well and it was necessary to pull as hard as possible so that the water ran out, dirty floors and when we went to pay it found that the electricity costs were inflated because of what you pay dearly for the light you didn't really use. Weak wifi."
4607,2375694,4,julielkmoore,16/09/2022,After really looking forward to going here we were disappointed! Staff not too friendly and unhelpful when we wanted to extend our stay. Facilities modern and mostly clean but dirty floors. Good shade over premium pitches. Campsite busy and noisy till 12pm so will not be rushing back !
4607,2373397,5,Aventurier73,15/09/2022,very nice campsite pitch for motorhome super toilets and very clean showers quiet environment to recommend
4607,2329701,3,marisacaravana,01/09/2022,"good camping, but unnecessary pool music at 9pm, as you are near pufffggg. That's why maximum 5. On the contrary, good service, the restaurant's pizzas are very good"
4607,2174761,4,Olimpaco,04/08/2022,"Everything great, but almost zero wifi, the pool is not up to the quality of the campsite, impeccable facilities"
4607,2157020,1,tomtom61,01/08/2022,"We had reserved, but didn't get to the site because other very large campers were standing in the spaces along the driveway, well over 1m larger than the space on the street. At the reception the very arrogant ladies didn't care. It is obviously common on this CP that tenants who are there more often and longer (are allowed to) take all the cheek out of it."
4607,2136351,4,Eihorn,28/07/2022,A very nicely laid out place on a beautiful beach. I've known this place for many years - but we don't go here every year. The toilet buildings are all at a different level or are gradually being modernized. A small shop on site is enough for basic supplies - a Lidl is within walking distance or by bike. This year a * star deduction: -dissatisfaction with the reservation -too much+loud music at the pool (NB access is currently controlled) -there is a cockroach problem at the toilet house with access code -price increase
4607,2043770,5,BulliAS,06/07/2022,"Spent 2 relaxing nights here. Without construction site noise. Everything was clean, great WiFi on the large pitches. Within walking distance to many restaurants in town and at Club Nautico, Flyboard watersports that offer tours on jet skis and much more."
4607,2021863,5,borjaymaria811,29/06/2022,"one more year, some spectacular days here, the perfect place to unwind and be in luxury, as I said last year, we will repeat for sure!!! beach, pool, restaurants, everything you can ask for"
4607,1853627,3,nata82,26/04/2022,"At the foot of the beach, everything mega clean and tidy, but the attention is lacking. We stayed in the camper area, very empty, strange. €80.50 for 2 nights motorhome, without electricity and two people and two dogs. At 8 am we discovered why it was so empty, a construction site from 8 am to 8 pm, all day breaking into a wall with machines and trucks and workers with loud music and shouting."
4607,1788937,3,megatruck,20/03/2022,"Stayed for 1 night, good for large mobile homes, showers clean and warm, pool left out - restaurant closed. Pizzeria on site recommended. Fee a little too high, ASCI not accepted ...."
4607,1778746,5,pedroribeiro25,10/03/2022,"Superb Camping site.
I´ve been there quite a few times and its one of the few campings I repeat over and over again. 
It's on the beach, the pool is amazing but a bit noisy due to the family atmosphere in the summer time, its near a small city center the new toilets are clean and modern and the camping site is really spacious. 
I recommend both restaurants but the pizza is my recommendation."
4607,1759914,5,storchennest,19/02/2022,"Very nice place, a lot made new z.Bsp. wash house, very clean, over the dunes you are directly on the long sandy beach"
4607,1705801,5,Mobema,07/12/2021,Big place right on the beach. There is a small supermarket and a restaurant. We were welcomed very friendly. The sanitary facilities are very clean. The campsite was well filled despite the low season (especially with German long-term campers: inside).
4607,1704074,4,Grootendeern,05/12/2021,"The campsite is on a wonderful beach right behind the dune - really nice! We spent a quiet night in a large plot with electricity (extra charge with meter). At this time of year the place was almost completely full. The regular toilets / showers are unfortunately quite old, there are new ones with extra code access - ask for them! The restaurant on the square is not recommended!"
4607,1531324,4,veromese,30/08/2021,Pitches with awning for shade. Direct access to the beach. Pool controlled with capacity by covid. Some sanitary blocks could improve. Good animation.
4607,1468759,4,borjaymaria811,16/08/2021,"Perfect campsite with a good location a little high price, but good"
4607,1375936,4,Ccarrollerteam,28/07/2021,Superb place. Private beach well located between Oliva town and Oliva beach. Very clean and very pleasant campsite BUT its price is a strong deterrent to staying for a long time 70 € / d
4607,1261332,2,svemirtifi,18/06/2021,"Very good location to the beach and nice parking spaces. But I cannot report any more good things. The reception is not manned on arrival, nor do the bell, other employees cannot contact their colleagues. Electricity costs extra at an already very self-confident price. The access code for the sanitary facilities is only given on request. So back to reception ..."
4607,1213706,1,alfapaliz1971,23/05/2021,"Very unpleasant and unfriendly, they do not help you at all, there is a receptionist in her 50s who thinks she is the owner and treats you with contempt and the price for excessive overnight stays"

4607,1017156,4,mchicoc,31/08/2020,"In the camper area it is fine but in summer it is very hot and not all pitches have air. At the campsite it is fine, although you have to check the bill. Large plots with sufficient services. This year of 2020, no control over masks or distances. They try to cover the file without enforcing the rules. This year I went in July and August and in July much better. August malmal"
4607,791505,1,encarnita,05/03/2020,"They are rats, you have to be careful with the light, you go with the Acsi card and they say that they give you the discount and when you go out they tell you that you have been with the light and they charge you, you cannot check it because there is no meter"
4607,646349,1,balooui,20/08/2019,The owners very rude and unpleasant. Very bad treatment received. The pool is not controlled and anyone strains and is pulled from a railing. They almost threw themselves on top. Very expensive and not recommended.
4607,607600,1,KarmannLT,07/08/2019,In the high season we have 65 !!! Euro paid for one night. Giant place. Not the basic idea of Park4night- we stayed because I did not want to drive anymore. But too expensive! Not my taste.
4607,425670,3,Wal0606,30/01/2019,"Camping is very well maintained and nice, but who wants when he is in Spain behind a dike. Location in not nice. For € 24.50 I do not want to look in a sand dune! I drove again !!!!"
4607,408931,3,Annabanenna,20/11/2018,"In a low season there are places from 16,00 € (without electricity) - completely sufficient. For 16 € ok. Showers & toilet very clean. Right on the beach. There is a small restaurant & a small supermarket. So everything you need for a few nights."
4607,269368,5,Descargados,16/06/2018,"A very good stay in this campsite. The beach is great and 50m from the campsite. Very nice new nice pool. Pizzeria / chickens / portions at a reasonable price at the campsite. When staying, you can access the Kikoport Restaurant to a ""camper menu"" for € 12.50, which is VERY good. Without a doubt, a camping more than recommendable!"
4607,186125,5,fjnila,27/08/2017,"1st camping with direct beach access, very familiar and nice. Shade, water, light and drainage in the plots great comfort."
4607,139053,1,Ivyvan,29/05/2017,"Horrible experience, edges and rude. Prejudices Obliged to sleep in the overnight area outside the campsite and without supervision, anyone can enter on foot. Services outside the area, you have to leave the area and cross the street and enter the campsite through the back door. Unsafe for everyone! Dirty services Unsafe! Discrimination! Awful experience My worst experience in a camping!"
4607,82738,3,mercator,18/07/2016,"Home in french and nice, location ok but expensive to have shade, beach nearby well maintained"
4607,65875,4,romanzh,20/03/2016,Nice and clean
4607,51359,4,garciamyriam@sfr.fr,22/08/2015,Great. Great atmosphere and beach front with the bar in the sand.
4607,23408,5,cece3390,19/08/2014,Great place especially when you have children. The plots of motorhomes are correct even if the prices are a bit high: count about 30 € per day with electricity. But the sea is 2 minutes walk and the beach super nice. Note that there is free wifi.
4607,22259,5,lagie,12/08/2014,Excellent !
4652,2923201,5,ElodieClergue,04/07/2023,Quiet place with a nice view.

The best thing is, that it is coll up here.. 32 down in the valley and 18 Celsius up here"

4652,1468020,5,clodu07,16/08/2021,Very nice place in a cool and quiet area. Lots of motorhomes but not on top of each other. Nice mountain bike trails all around. We ended up staying there for 3 nights
4652,1439856,5,jfglobetroter,11/08/2021,"Superb view, near chairlift and hikes, a little cool night, provide the holds. A lot of CC in this month of August, but without being shy"
4652,1309168,5,bobo1996,09/07/2021,Beautiful and quiet place with a fantastic view - a must if you're in the area!
4652,1305078,5,patpluchart,08/07/2021,Great location ... breathtaking view! Daily passage of cows. Many hikes all around. Possibility to take the chairlift to go to the bouillouse lake even with a dog .... chairlift 200 m.
4652,1044014,5,pamarchal44,12/09/2020,"Great place! but indeed it can be cold there. we were there on 09/07 and it was 1 ° C during the night! we also had the visit of the cows, which adds to the charm of this spot"

4652,966530,5,Rosebike,15/08/2020,"Very nice view if you are well placed. CCs all along the road, but we do not hesitate too much, each being on the side of his vehicle. Departure of hikes. Chairlift 200 m to Lake Pradeilles then 35 minutes on foot to Lake Bouillouses. I loved the place. No services. Garbage cans at the pkg of the chairlift."
4652,960338,5,Marcelau,13/08/2020,"Great spot but we were not the only ones! You have to get there early .... For lovers of hiking below there is the start of a short walk of 3.5 km (one way) with the arrival at a small refuge (that of the Calm), a little corner of paradise we were served a delicious dish of the day and our 4 year old son loved his dessert (the ice creams are delicious)!"
4652,922600,5,kass,02/08/2020,Super quiet place and great view
4652,884684,5,cancan49,20/07/2020,Great view. calm in the evening. start of the hike. awesome.

4652,627769,4,bigboss666,14/08/2019,"Nice place relatively flat and calm. Plenty of space along the road. Very nice view, unless the clouds arrive from the valley and the temperature drops to 15 ° C. After a quiet night."
4652,595856,5,fc34fr,03/08/2019,Very good location! Large enough not to interfere when several campers are present. Small discreet place against low for the needs.
4652,584018,5,nonobrokenarrow,29/07/2019,Magical???
4652,364978,4,StephChapeau,04/09/2018,Cool night but super quiet. Very beautiful view !
4652,321389,4,estelle86,08/08/2018,"Indeed, very beautiful view. There are people but we can stay spaced because the area is large. Right next to the start of the chairlifts to go up to the lake at the opening."
4652,308640,3,berny1650,31/07/2018,"Very quiet despite the proximity of the gondola access road, starting easy hikes nearby"

4652,169495,5,kozati,09/08/2017,"This is the place to sleep when you are in Font Romeu, it is busy but really plenty of room and we have the sunset as a bonus. If the wind blows too hard, we can fall back on car parks in the forest below. There is a little passage in the evening, and not bad in the day because it is a place of departure to go to admire the lake Bouillouses. It remains the top."
4652,160558,5,sam66,29/07/2017,Gorgeous ! recommended place
4652,153826,5,YannickF,18/07/2017,"Very quiet place, we spent several nights, it is almost flat roadside with a pretty nice view and mid-July traffic to the chairlift is limited so there is not too much noise. For hikers to the Bouillouses lake the chairlift is a few minutes walk (open from 8:30 to 17:30 in summer)"
4652,132978,3,lagadou93,04/05/2017,Okay quiet but apart from the solar oven and trees not top le.point
4652,107733,4,marylou37,28/09/2016,Nice place but a little edge of the road. Quiet out of season and near downtown
4652,97304,5,chavidou,19/08/2016,Thank you for allowing us to park and congratulations to the chairlift staff for their kindness to people and animals
4652,89399,5,Melojubjo,04/08/2016,Stunning ! 2 steps from the chairlifts for Lake Bouillouses ☺

4652,47964,5,Raymond78,11/08/2015,"Superb panorama, quiet, a real postcard"
4954,3234460,3,LTvHuE,29/08/2023,"The stated flat rate price of €22 is unfortunately misleading. The receptionist initially gave us a price of €35, but then corrected it to €52, supposedly a discount. The negative is the sandy beach, which is extremely narrow and suddenly drops deep after a few meters in the water. Hardly suitable for children. The plots and sanitary facilities in order. WiFi works perfectly."
4954,2943860,5,RafaBS,09/07/2023,"We have spent the weekend there, the plot is great, lots of shade, water, drainage and light on the plot. Clean bathrooms and laundry facilities nearby throughout the campsite. The super friendly treatment and good vibes among customers. We will return for sure. Thank you"
4954,2766686,4,crigbee1,20/05/2023,We spent seven days here and had a nice large pitch. Unfortunately the beach was being repaired after it was washed away in a storm. However the beach a little further on is beautiful. Excellent facilities including a dog wash.
4954,2755169,4,MarekJelnicki,16/05/2023,the best campsite in Spain on our route. unfortunately they are rebuilding the beaches and the water is cloudy. I recommend
4954,2704128,1,GuilleRosa09092000,28/04/2023,"We are lifelong campers, more than 40 years. What about this lousy campsite, outrageous plots, the attention at reception has never been seen before. With more than 2 months of reservation indicating the plot number for going in a group and they have not respected anything, on the other hand we chose a plot and they told us that they were already assigned to groups, outrageous, terrible treatment, with the ACSI card they charge a supplement for all"
4954,2643162,3,womododo,06/04/2023,"Very nicely laid out, very clean place, friendly staff! One star deducted for access to the sea via a rock dike. Another star deduction for the noise pollution (dogs)!"
4954,2616452,5,Abril20,19/03/2023,"Huge campsite with pitches, bungalows and apartments. All plots have light, water and drainage and lots of shade. Direct beach plots. All services for AC's. Clean showers with very hot water. Very, very clean throughout the campsite. With all the facilities and more! Also animation. We went to the opening: €40; 2 nights, 2 adults, 1 baby, lamp and a free pair of underwear per person. Unbelievable!"
4954,2428040,5,martinikat,07/10/2022,superb campsite. super clean very friendly staff. pool beach small store .. nothing is missing. beautiful location 22 € per night all inclusive with acsi
4954,2113920,3,nayarai,24/07/2022,"July '22. AC 2 adults 2 children €65/night and €150 half board. I would recommend just breakfast option, but the MP's dinner is poor, and repetitive day after day. It's not worth what it costs. Shaded pitches and plenty of privacy. Swimming pools fall short for the many people there are. Animation and staff in general, 10. The beach is quite bad after the Gloria storm of '21"
4954,1972049,5,espacio5mas1,12/06/2022,"Perfect campsite to go with children, animation, swimming pool, 1 beach line, closed children's area, etc. And for older people, a beautiful bar with sea views. By the way, the staff at 10 and on the last day set up an area to park the AC and enjoy the facilities."
4954,1970640,4,Muegge95,12/06/2022,"I would actually give it 3 stars because the price is a bit disappointing. However, the space offers too much (huge pool area, mini-golf, small sports field, great bars/restaurants). Unfortunately, the beach is no longer directly in front of the site (storms) and will not be restored. Long distances to showers & toilets (modern, but not very clean). But overall good!"
4954,1906903,2,Jzeus,22/05/2022,Expensive campsite for what it offers. If you go out later than 12 they charge you €15. Small pool for the people there. Camping around better and better price.
4954,1847779,4,DaCo122,23/04/2022,"Very nice campsite with a sauna that was open in April! We also used the breakfast buffet for 9.75 euros and were very satisfied. We can only recommend the place, there's a star deduction for the fact that there is no beach."
4954,1803892,4,welsheagle,02/04/2022,"An ok site but no beach here anymore and no access to one unless you go outside the site. Good, clean sanitary facilities,even have dog baths and showers. Lovely pool area, bar and restaurant. Small supermarket"
4954,1723743,1,laylaaardappel,02/01/2022,location is closed until march 2022 because of renovation.

4954,1285960,3,Zhoser,29/06/2021,"The campsite is good, large pitches with plenty of shade, large pool, gym, spa, restaurant. Clean services. I give it 3 stars for how expensive it is, 83 euros per night, two adults, child and pet. It is not worth that price, they do not encourage much so let's go to the campsites."
4954,1272017,2,iosubingen,23/06/2021,Very very expensive campsite for the services they provide.
4954,1105440,5,SandraRic,25/10/2020,Great place. One of the few that is still open at the end of October. There are different sizes of the pitches. At the very front even some by the sea. But everyone walks past there. Each place has its own water inlet and gray water outlet (if you have your long hose with you).
4954,796829,5,Lina_timmermann,20/03/2020,We stayed for one night only. Only a third of the place was opened and a lot was under construction. But we payed 18 € (I think) for a place that offers a gym and a lot more.. and im sure its a lot more expansive during summer and when it's finished. We had a really nice stay and the staff was very friendly too :)
4954,763628,5,kombi68,04/01/2020,"I went there at the end of December on a whim, without booking well in advance. This campsite is magnificent with well-kept vegetation, very well thought out and organized with the seafront buses and the bungalows behind, spaces for calm and games for all. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. I loved. I will return once at Easter or in October with pleasure."
4954,762418,5,Irko83,02/01/2020,"Absolutely perfect, very clean sanitary facilities, staff always available, good restaurant, fairly complete grocery store, very quiet and very pleasant seaside promenade, very good location with water, electricity, drain and satellite TV, we will probably come back"
4954,757154,5,konrau1,26/12/2019,Very nice place. Directly at the sea. Very very friendly. Definitely visit.
4954,753758,5,horstinator,15/12/2019,"Absolutely quiet at the time of the year - Special price for 2 people and parking space directly at the sea € 21 per night including tourist tax Of course, not everything is always open, but with a total of 7 campers on the pitch, it's no wonder. We are 30 meters from the nearest camper, right by the sea behind a small artificial dune that catches the wind and enjoy the sun in mid-December. Staff was extremely friendly and everything is super clean including the beach. Wifi is great."
4954,742504,5,chuppachop,13/11/2019,Recently taken over now open all year right on beach facilities second to none only negative in middle of nowhere
4954,658156,5,gramos,25/08/2019,"The campsite is great, it is completely renovated with new bungalows and restaurants and all fairly new facilities."
4954,645396,5,Zaf07,20/08/2019,"We stayed one night with 2 adults and 1 child under 6, we paid 66 euros a night on a location said prestige. Water and electricity are included as well as gray and black water drainage. Very friendly, and very well maintained!"
4954,575722,4,Allan214,25/07/2019,"Camping very nice, we had the place 205, next to the sea and sea view! It's awesome! Pool very friendly for children! Camping very quiet, not many people on the beach, even in high season (sandy beach with lots of pebbles)! Small negative point: the street lights remain lit all night, along the sites at the seaside! The amenities are scattered and cleaning frequency very low! You have to negotiate to have the best location! As said before, we were with a 7 meter motorhome and actually access to the sites are very small but feasible!"
4954,477415,2,momerii,06/05/2019,"Good camping, but we arrived at 7:00 pm and the next day with many free places we were released at 12.00, if we wanted to stay longer with a supplement of € 15."
4954,272190,4,tiroseno,20/06/2018,Good camping next to the beach. There is a sector for dogs. Spacious and clean bathrooms. Very large pool with jets and secluded for children. tb has a spa and gym.
4954,232888,4,albtalhexe,03/04/2018,"Stayed here for Easter for a couple of days. The course is divided into two sections with and without a dog. Sanitary facilities were ok. Plots generous and with electricity, water, sewerage. Beach quite narrow, but big swimming pool."
4954,84964,4,aurelie7774,24/07/2016,"Camping seaside .. Place very cramped, difficulties to maneuver our camper 7 meters. Downtown about 3 km, for cycling, super dangerous road. wholesale camping ideal to land without moving. Nice swimming pool, clean toilets, several restaurants, minimarket at the right prices and even a small super-accessible clothing store."

4954,25729,5,Baboun64,08/09/2014,"Camping on the beach, cheap dream, nice pool. Camping for dogs. Concerts, even in September animation. A camper 2 adults, a dog 28.50 €. I recommend"
4967,2798909,5,TJ64,29/05/2023,Charming and quiet place with a nice view as a bonus?
4967,2729812,4,Salva1960,07/05/2023,"I spent a night in the parking lot next to the church. It is made of gravel, flat, level, without delimiting squares, there are garbage cans and a water fountain. Quiet night with two more ACs. The church bell rings every hour but you can sleep. Dawn with the song of the birds. During the day a lot of mosquitoes. It is worth taking a guided tour of the church. There are routes for walking and hiking."

4974,2300103,5,fbrunner,25/08/2022,"We spent very quiet nights here. At least in August, it is advisable to arrive early in the morning or late in the afternoon, when the light vehicles have not yet arrived or have already left, so there are many empty seats. It is possible to do maintenance at Camping São Pedro de Moel for 5 euros."

It is worth knowing. the parking is very comfortable, safe and with garbage and recycling containers next to it. The only negative thing is that the road is close, and as it is cobbled, you can hear a lot of traffic. But hey, after 23 it's already a luxury, you can only hear the sound of the sea."

Don't forget to drink a wine at cafe da Praia during the sunset or go there for a coffee in the morning. Very nice owner!"

4974,134082,5,Sophielagirafe,09/05/2017,"Some car passages in the late evening but nothing bad. Be wary of the paths in the bushes, we wanted to walk our dogs there, but to cross wild dogs not very convenient. Otherwise the city is beautiful, we strongly recommend"

BUT: In the evening a person came, walked around our car and then shook our ladder while we were sitting in it / wanted to gain access to the car. Then saw another person leaving, who looked around several times. We drove directly and didn't feel safe there at that moment. Unfortunately."

4977,156576,4,philpscamp79,23/07/2017,We spent the night on this remote car park in the city. In the night 2 others joined us. Beautiful view over the cliffs at breakfast. The Republican National Guard spent this morning on mountain bikes. The presence of motorhomes does not disturb as long as the site remains clean and the neighboring residences are not disturbed. Let's stay discreet and we will be welcome for a long time!

4979,3118498,5,rachaelmharri,10/08/2023,"Ideal spot to avoid the crowds on the coast and outside of the National Park..  Great to sleep to the sounds of birds, frogs and cicadas.  GNR drove past in the morning and said nothing.  Incredible for sunset and sunrise."

4979,3071875,4,Altsasu,03/08/2023,"Quiet place, about 4 vans spent the night on a weekday in July. The landscape is beautiful but the water in the lake was quite low. The wind blows a little, but if you play with the van's direction, no problem. However, there was dirt left by the people who had been there before... it's a shame to fill such places with dirt. Let's take care of nature!"
4979,2942246,5,dutchanddriving,09/07/2023,"Quiet place on the water. You can also swim there. No amenities, but that's the trade off for a quiet beautiful place in nature :)"
4979,2910063,4,KibritjianDenis,01/07/2023,"superb quiet corner, reservoir of fresh water, superb at daybreak very calm and pleasant. not a noise but the sound of birds. The place is clean, notice to all those who pass by, to keep the place clean."

4979,2432124,4,jakeoc,09/10/2022,"It was a decent spot although the road is very uneven, and it’s also a hunting ground so we woke up to hunters firing their guns and their dogs parking early the next morning. It’s a shame how much the lake has dried up! Grand for one night"

4979,2157719,5,cedlae86,01/08/2022,"Large natural space as we like them. Do not hesitate to turn right when you arrive at the dam, the path is not in very good condition, but it takes you directly to the edge of the water."
4979,2125143,5,Yaute05,26/07/2022,"great spot!! freshwater lake but not necessarily very clean. large space to let go of your dog and have fun. very quiet, there were other vans so we felt safe."
4979,2014012,5,FamilieGeiger,26/06/2022,Stood here one night with no problems. it was very quiet but a bit windy. Were only 4 vans on Saturday night and very well distributed.

Internet very good

4979,1497793,5,RuiVal,22/08/2021,Very calm. I recommend spending the night or a few days. On weekends it is busier for residents.
4979,1394881,1,verliebte_aussteiger,02/08/2021,"This place is also in the hunting area, as can be seen in the picture above. Furthermore, it is very littered here. We drove on."

4979,847439,5,sarahb78,04/07/2020,"2/07/20 We were alone, peaceful. several very flat pitches, with a magnificent view. A lot of wind (there are wind turbines not far) but by orienting the CC it was magic. Well, on the right, you can see the industrial area in the distance but frankly we completely forget it. nice walk around the lake (starting on the right)"
4979,797761,5,izumiberat,31/03/2020,"We loved it. The children picked up a lot of 'precious' stones, we made a fire in the evening, and a nice bike ride around the lake. We spent two days playing on the rocks overlooking the dam."
4979,797614,3,Joanja,29/03/2020,Nice places by the lake. It is currently about half full. The street is not very busy at late hours and is therefore quiet. Unfortunately there was a lot of rubbish lying around. Have collected a lot but please take your garbage with you or even better collect something when you are there. The GNR gave us information about Corona and was otherwise very relaxed and should stay that way!
4979,794021,5,Sharlynn,11/03/2020,"Super quiet spot, there is plenty to park without sticking to each other. We hear frogs at night, with a beautiful spectacle of stars and moon. Far from dry lake (March 2020 also). We also did not smell any urine. Clean space, nothing to say except that it's perfect !!"
4979,790679,3,unschoolers,04/03/2020,"There is enough to park with several without being embarrassed, however a strong and very present smell of urine is felt throughout the parking places !!! (Over a very long distance!) We stay there only for the night and will leave early in the morning. the lake is almost dry during our visit in March 2020."
4979,752681,5,Ayesha,11/12/2019,Lovely spot. Plenty of different places around the lake to pull over not just the three shown here. Stayed for 2 nights but have the idea that others stayed longer.

4979,642184,5,Alestt,19/08/2019,"Easy access, enough room not to be on top of each other, quiet night. BUT ... always the same complaint: nature is not a trash! It gives you the possibility to sleep under the stars RESPECT! Pick up your garbage cans and toilet paper !!! Thank you"

It seems from my German neighbor who comes there 6 months a year that there are big fish. Do not go to the other side of the dam impossible to find parking. By cons, I will add at least another area next door under trees."
4979,437777,4,bumblebussing,08/03/2019,Great spot. loads of space. easy acces. good for dog walks. near to Porto covo.

4979,415419,5,hansthevan,22/12/2018,"I had commented before saying we could not find this spot in the dark an rain. We went back in daylight and are so glad we did. No facilities but a beautiful secluded area. We swam in the freshwater lake, really nice."
4979,414849,2,hansthevan,18/12/2018,It may have been nice but as it was dark and windy and rainy it was too hard to find and we had to turn back- reccommend only trying in daytime!

5071,2997907,5,Alainmorez,21/07/2023,"Super beach, very large especially at low tide, very clean, dogs are accepted, very friendly people, plenty of room to park"
5071,2355823,3,psviteri,09/09/2022,They have put the gauge back.
5071,2295710,5,Irisdc,24/08/2022,"Esplanade, unlimited clearance, during the day the car park fills with cars, great to go with a dog, the beach is very good, many dogs and a good atmosphere."
5071,2250746,3,mercelz,16/08/2022,"There is no gauge barrier. We stayed for several days, and we saw cars, from the Castro police and the Civil Guard, pass through the parking lot without saying anything to the vehicles that were in it. The beach of the perrillos very funny. There is no proper toilet."
5071,2146559,3,RedVan77,30/07/2022,Quiet zone. But they told us that they had left notices not to spend the night. We did not dare to spend the night. We slept in the parking lot that is a little before this one. The barrier that limits 2m has been torn down. You can pass until they fix it. It is ideal to go with pets since there is a beach right next to it where they allow bathing on the side of the estuary.
5071,1957867,5,cynthiaanton11,08/06/2022,"Cool! Although there is a 2m ban, for large vans there is the outside area where you can also park."
5071,1602358,4,SerKra,23/09/2021,"Good place, quiet and with enough space to park. To go with a dog is perfect, one of the best places and allowed to be with him on the beach in the estuary area. There are nearby bars and a shop where you can buy food"
5071,1038345,1,iratxe.emaldi,10/09/2020,Clearly at the entrance it says that camping and spending the night is prohibited. there is another in the town at 200m that has no prohibition.
5071,992357,5,illun1978,22/08/2020,Great!!!!!
5071,980855,5,bill.murphy,19/08/2020,"Parking with a height limit of 2 m. Very quiet, next to the beach and without much movement at night. You sleep fresh!"
5071,954418,2,supertrump,12/08/2020,"The place is quite dirty and at night there are slugs everywhere. If you go with a dog it's fine, if not, go somewhere else"
5071,942534,4,Vaquesenfurgo,09/08/2020,"We slept tonight, we came from Islares where we couldn't find a place. Very large parking, with the height limitation 2m, with the van without problems. Despite the fact that there were several vans setting up the party, the music was not loud, respecting the rest. In the early morning there is a lot of people going to the estuary / beach."
5071,916520,3,Dordokaibiltaria,01/08/2020,"Good views. Entrance maximum height 2m (ACs spend the night in the street), during the day a lot of cars, at night only vans, quiet place, at the entrance of the parking it clearly prohibits overnight stays, (we have also stayed overnight) and without any problem. There are showers (we didn't see them) but they are as you enter the parking lot to the left. If you have a dog, ideally dogs can access the estuary area."
5071,857129,4,Mendigosaurio,09/07/2020,"Quiet place at night, crowded by day. A little dirty but recommended."
5071,735873,3,wildandsalty,01/11/2019,Nice parking space for one night. A little too close to apartments / houses for my taste. Beautiful beach. WC / shower I have NOT seen.
5071,666396,3,DartVan,29/08/2019,"It has a sign at the entrance forbidden to spend the night and a height limit barrier, but we have spent 5 campers night. A little further on there is a parking lot with shade and without height limitation"
5071,614356,5,annagusa,10/08/2019,Very quiet place 100% recommended. Everything and put that you can not spend the night we have slept perfectly in our Berlingo!
5071,603829,5,fitzinthewild,06/08/2019,"We have been one night and we found the place ideal! Beach next door with access allowed to dogs, very quiet, with chemical toilet and showers. Highly recommended!"
5071,600688,5,Tokana,05/08/2019,"Very calm, lots of places. Parking limited to 2 meters but possibility to park further on other parking for motorhome. The beach is atypical because split into several strips of sand. A stream flows into the sea and creates an original separation which allows to enjoy a calm water and right next to the waves of the sea. Very nice place I strongly advise."
5071,568316,4,tooom,22/07/2019,Parking very calm. night with only another van. limited 2m. service 2 chemical toilet and outdoor shower. clean beach.
5071,468857,5,vicdanernie,27/04/2019,Fantastic location near a quiet beach. A few dog walkers and family's about. We had the place to ourselves overnight. 2m height restriction at entrance.
5071,315889,3,sergiomaciasc,05/08/2018,"You can park outside the AC barrier and you are next to the beach. It is better to arrive at night or in the early morning (9-10) on weekends and in summer months because it is very difficult to park during the day. By the way, the beach has a specific area for dogs all year round. Ideal to spend the day with your best friend!"
5071,218072,5,karolejosefabonnet,07/01/2018,Great place to spend the night for a small van (bar 2 m) at the edge of the very calm water.
5071,89951,4,Chache_Carlos,06/08/2016,Yesterday they put a goal limiting the entrance to vehicles less than 2 m. Outside we are parked 5 motorhomes.
5071,89563,1,downtheroad,05/08/2016,Last night at this quiet but now closed parking with a limited bar height of 2 m
5071,88988,3,theotomsamlilou,03/08/2016,Armored during the day but nice in the evening at the start of all cars. In total autonomy.
5071,78736,1,kaelimatat,27/06/2016,It was nice before 2014 and the appearance of a bar at 1.80 m ....
5071,21224,1,tomaprice,06/08/2014,The bar is at 1.80 meters ...
5071,1924,0,icthus,05/09/2012,Enter Orinon and follow the one-way
5156,3240775,5,merelkatja,31/08/2023,"A fantastic view! All facilities are well arranged, even a beautiful swimming pool with a view. When we arrived it was blowing very hard on the mountain, during the night the wind died down and it became wonderfully quiet."
5156,3237472,5,blackface59,30/08/2023,"Super idyllic, great view. Nice reception. Great sanitary facilities. Away from the road, access via a short gravel path, easily manageable. The lady leaves at 8 p.m. and then closes the gate, so you can't leave by car until morning, which wasn't a problem for us."
5156,3216045,5,tikiT4,25/08/2023,we discovered this stop by happy coincidence after a complicated night.. a little oasis of calm and tranquility. we parked our van for 3 nights and set up a small tent for our son in the shade of the trees. The reception is very pleasant. 25 euros at 3. Payment in cash. Washing machine. The only downside is that the site closes at 8 p.m.. no more traffic.
5156,3099879,5,Lucbizet,08/08/2023,"Very good campsite for motorhomes and converted vans. Very clean, and great hospitality. Very nice little swimming pool with a view of the valley. We stayed there for several days, we really enjoyed it. In the top."
5156,3089234,5,Tacu,06/08/2023,"Great place in the mountain, very quiet, clean and friendly.
Sanitary facilities very clean, with hot shower, place to wash dishes, washing machine (extra payment) and a nice pool with great views. Pitches are delimited, and you can have fresh water, take grey waters directly at your pitch, as well as electricity. The environment is very calm and staff very nice. Will come back for sure!!"
5156,3044908,5,RalfSommer,30/07/2023,"excellent facility with extremely friendly welcome. Everything well maintained, clean sanitary facilities. Very quiet location with walking opportunities around."
5156,3012356,5,Vanbuzz,24/07/2023,Lovely place and very very clean. The reception is also very friendly. It's a place we'll be happy to return to if our adventures take us there again.
5156,2968981,5,greglaurent62@gmail.com,15/07/2023,"After walking along the coast, a little rest in this very beautiful place, very quiet, comfortable, individual location, swimming pool, electricity, services, hot showers, dishwasher. Very nice home. From the swimming pool we saw on the sea. 20€ for two all inclusive, and the dog without supplement. Passing by we will be back."
5156,2946534,5,tiritos,10/07/2023,"Wonderful site. The people who run it are very friendly and very good people. For 20 euros 2 people with electricity, hot shower, pool and incredible views. We will return without a doubt. 100% recommendable."
5156,2866064,5,DMSTRAVELS,18/06/2023,Quality site so peaceful away from the maddening crowds at the beach lovely toilets and showers the swimming pool first class .  Has all facilities if I could give more stars I would . Highly recommended this place.
5156,2746780,5,urmel328,13/05/2023,"If you are looking for a day or a night of rest - you will find it here. Absolutely sufficiently large parking spaces for normal vehicles (... the 8m parts are not there anyway). Nice little pool, always clean sanitary facilities and very friendly operators."
5156,2729163,2,zebra100,06/05/2023,"Beautiful place but pitches are too close together. 
Washing up is next to toilets and only has cold water !!!!
Waste disposal is a toilet on a lawn where you hang washing !!!!
You are locked in by an electric gate at 8pm and it’s not opened until 8am( if your lucky) 
No rules given on arrival. No mention of lock in.
Management don’t have a clue."
5156,2725933,5,CharlottaP,05/05/2023,"Our intention was to fill up water and power, but the place is such a gem, so we decided to stay over night. Nice hosts, clean and a pool for only 20 euro/night. Look out for the wind forcast!"
5156,2677282,5,IlkaK,17/04/2023,"The place is beautifully situated in the middle of the mountains, everything is very lovingly prepared. The view is terrific. I find €20 totally reasonable for one night with two people, camper van and dog with hot showers, good toilets and a beautiful little pool."
5156,2669711,5,marioglavasevic,14/04/2023,We had a great stay. Beautiful place and very friendly staff!!!
5156,2646302,5,derbert,07/04/2023,"A very nice, well-kept, quiet pitch in the mountains with all amenities, swimming pool and electricity, water and drainage on every pitch. We were received and looked after very warmly and friendly by Lara and her little daughter. Unlike the other small spirits, I found the € 20 absolutely reasonable! We only wanted to stay one night and stayed five."
5156,2610516,4,montanja,15/03/2023,"View is pretty awesome, as are the stars at night. The young women at the reception was very kind and helpful. The facilities are clean and have toilet paper (always a win). 20€ a night is expensive though, that’s why it’s 4 stars."
5156,2587160,4,JanUK,22/02/2023,A lovely quiet site with good clean facilities. Access up a steep but well maintained track.  Friendly reception. I have given it 4 stars as I think 20 Euros in winter in Portugal is expensive. I would expect hot water in the sinks for that price.
5156,2571700,5,Barbaraj,08/02/2023,"Great place, really friendly helpful staff - all facilities inc washing machines and a nice pool. Loads of walks about and a bar 1 km walk away. If you like quiet secluded spots you’ll love this"
5156,2528278,3,AneSch,25/12/2022,"The place is very well maintained and in the middle of nature, but for 1 person and 1 camper I think €20 is absolutely overpriced. Electricity is included, as is the small pool, but what am I doing in the pool in December?"
5156,2503557,5,wilburtransitnz,23/11/2022,"Lovely and quiet, up in the hills. We had our first night in a campground in 6 weeks here, showered etc. No dryer and weather drizzling so we didn’t wash clothes. Clean and tidy place, the odd mozzie. Book exchange in office, English speaking young woman to assist. The park spots are long and wide, the dirt road we’ll maintained and no issue."
5156,2493433,5,Barzek,13/11/2022,just perfect. place isolated from the noise in the middle of nature. very friendly welcome. easy access . very very clean landscaped. 10 individual places. pool damage cold water but in November still very good weather. Highly recommend 200%
5156,2471596,5,geronimo58,30/10/2022,"A paradise in the middle of nature. Absolute peace and more than you need. Water connection and gray water drainage at every pitch. Also ideal for dogs, as there are lots of dirt roads right on the site."
5156,2423667,3,chantalette,04/10/2022,Difficult access by unpaved road of 1 km. We arrived at 6 p.m. but too late to make a machine....and we still paid 20 euros for 1 motorhome and 2 people.
5156,2411168,4,melis9,29/09/2022,Welcoming reception by Maria (speaks English). €15 all-in. Spacious and good showers. Beautiful view!

You have everything you need, free hot water for all users at any time. Washing machine, barbecue and covered seating included. Would love to come back!!"
5156,2357536,5,patiu,10/09/2022,Too great to empty the waste water without moving your motorhome for the black water a help from a small trolley to transport the cassette everything is functional incredible mountain view a haven of peace with your eyes closed thank you to the owner keep this place clean respected please
5156,2340268,4,Chameana,04/09/2022,"If you are looking for tranquility this place can be good for you, I would say if you are passing through, the access is through a narrow dirt path, they charged me 25 euros for 4 people with electricity and a small pool."
5156,2312632,4,Alfaleen,28/08/2022,Just the Max : everything is provided for the motorhome and clean . Beautiful walks and scooter trips from here

5156,2240399,5,Bartolino1606,15/08/2022,"A beautiful and well-kept place with sufficiently large places, a clean pool. The sanitary facilities are also impeccable. Large showers with hot water It's worth staying here. The only drawback was the strong wind... But that doesn't always have to be the case"
5156,2194262,5,Lisanaldi,07/08/2022,"Magnificent place: calm, beautiful view, serenity! Everything is well thought out, clean sanitary facilities, swimming pool which feels good. Only small downside: the cleanliness of the swimming pool which leaves a little to be desired, this did not prevent us from swimming. We would return there without hesitation !"
5156,2194000,5,JenikH,07/08/2022,Perfectly equipped. Small camp only for 15 campers for perfect price 15€. We spend here 2 nights because we was so much satisfied.

5156,2095541,5,patgr22,19/07/2022,"Exceptional place to stay one or two nights. In a natural environment with facilities that take care of visual pollution. It has a small pool that helped us survive the 36° temperature it was that day. A charming place to relax, with all the services and cheap. €15 per night with everything included."

5156,1816079,4,UteMeike,11/04/2022,"The place is designed quite nicely, with great attention to detail. I find the pitches a little tight, the distance to the neighbors was 2.5 meters and we have a small, narrow mobile home, so there is hardly any privacy. It would also be nice if there was warm water for rinsing."
5156,1771277,4,NellyNoe,02/03/2022,"We were there 2 days ago, very nice area, very clean, beautiful view of the mountain, friendly welcome all the services with the emptying of the camper van on site, I must add that there were large CCs, ours is 6.5 m but there was even a large ConcordeI"
5156,1768148,4,JABUINPA,27/02/2022,A very cozy and quiet area in the middle of nature. The only drawback is the somewhat small squares and that to get there you have to travel for a kilometer. down a dirt road with some slopes
5156,1750637,4,mogette,08/02/2022,A very nice place. The pitches are a bit small even with a van. Very pleasant environment and beautiful hikes like Picota Peak. No Orange network and poor WiFi except near the reception.
5156,1748775,5,Toubens,06/02/2022,We had a great time there but that was in 2011.
5156,1747662,5,Melissaba,04/02/2022,"Love this place! Well done camping! 15€ for a van, with el, Wi-Fi, hot showers and your own water tap at the pitch. Lovely welcomed by a French guy that’s showed us around the area! Thumbs up!"

5156,1732557,3,Samuell,12/01/2022,"Nice location, very quiet, something to come down to. Very well-kept area. In winter the place is unfortunately in the shade early. The parcels are not overly large."
5156,1731641,2,Huf,10/01/2022,"Pretty location with solid shower block.

Manager spoke French but no English. Reception was curt. Location is very expensive at €15 for a motorhome <6m with 1 person without electricity. Wouldn't recommend."

5156,1685522,5,turtletom,11/11/2021,"We stayed for a week in Nov/21 and were very happy with the camp sight. It is a very clean motorhome area, with small pool and great views. If you want to stay at a quite place with clean air, this is where to go.
The staff is extremely helpful. The motorhomes can drain their waste water and tank drinking water from right each parking spot.
I highly recommend this motorhome sight."
5156,1672167,5,prinjaum,31/10/2021,"It must be said again, Lara, in the company of Antonio, are really caring. We had a health problem, they helped us with everything (ambulance, hospital and return). The site is superb after a dirt road (swimming pool, sanitary facilities with hot water, WC, motorhome emptying, bread in the morning). The only downside is that the pitches are small. But they are wonderful AGAIN THANKS FOR EVERYTHING ;-) !!!"
5156,1663240,5,Granzebru,26/10/2021,"Actually everything is said. Lara is the good soul of the place. Always friendly, always a nice word. In the morning she brings the bread you ordered (delicious baguette) to the camper and wishes you a good breakfast. Da girl deserves 10 stars."
5156,1662140,5,rolfo61,25/10/2021,"Great little space with 14 parking spaces. extremely friendly operator. The approach from the country road on a gravel road, but went perfectly with our 9 meters. View to Portimao. Small, very clean pool. clean showers and toilets. Great starting point for a hike on the Foja. 15 euros per night. Thank you for the wonderful time."
5156,1648204,5,anneonroad,16/10/2021,"Perfect place. Absolutely quiet, very clean and nice people. A planned night turns into three nights. Ideal starting point for hiking and cycling."
5156,1636546,5,Simes09,10/10/2021,"At the end of a dirt Rd you find a lovely quiet spot. Clean and with  great amenities, a little pool to cool down in. The waste water system is worth coming to see...

Very beautiful mountain views!"

WC's, pool area and other areas of the park clean and well maintained!! Definitely a place to revisit and recommend! Thanks for the hospitality!!"
5156,1301852,5,lucaloha,06/07/2021,"Incredible place, we did not know what to expect for the different opinions, but we found ourselves in an oasis of tranquility. modest but very cozy space with lots of nice little details. all very well cared for. we will come back for sure. a pleasure that these places still exist"
5156,1279396,5,ALX667,26/06/2021,"Nice quiet place with a view of Portimao. Clean pool, well-kept sanitary facilities. Electricity and water on the pitch. We don't find the operator as spooky as described. A 1km long gravel road (without potholes) leads from the main road to the square."
5156,1124165,5,Lorosae,26/12/2020,"Park for motorhomes very well equipped, clean and with taste. Access is via a dirt track, but it does well even with large AC and is beautiful. WiFi included. Good for mountain hikes, including Monchique thermal springs. We feel very welcome by Mr. António, a reserved man but always available to help."
5156,1119534,1,autrement1,05/12/2020,"When I arrived, I must have noticed that the owner was non-existent and more precisely not very interested in his customers. I was told that the reception was better before, would there have been a change of owner? Great efforts have to be made in the reception of possible clients. I left confused, wondering the interest of coming to this place. We may wonder if on the directional display of the area we did not write ""go your way"" CQFD"
5156,1119297,1,Zelulu,04/12/2020,It's over… as if the park was closed since Isabelle is no longer there. And it is final despite what the owner says ...
5156,1118333,1,knauss22,29/11/2020,We came to the park very beautiful place to see Isabelle unfortunately the soul of this park is no longer there what sadness ... we only stayed one night
5156,1111439,5,JeremyTania,02/11/2020,"Quiet, clean toilets, warm welcome in French, beautiful walks from the campsite. In the top !"
5156,1099274,3,sosaw,19/10/2020,"Great, welcome and environment. 15 euros for one person and a van without electricity, swimming pool closed at the moment."
5156,1084283,5,luisbfalmeida,06/10/2020,We looked for the park to pour water and the cassette. We feel sorry for it being early because we feel like staying overnight. The place is really good at all levels ... sympathy included!
5156,1077748,5,aebichrigu,01/10/2020,"This place deserves applause! Beautifully located, very well-kept and clean! The owner is very helpful and nice. A place for connoisseurs!"
5156,1072143,5,locoinkieto,27/09/2020,"Very complete and quiet AC area. Access is by a track without difficulty. Very well signposted and very nice people. They do not speak Spanish, but they make themselves understood perfectly. The plots are very well prepared with independent water and light connections, and gray casting. It has bathrooms with shower, and washing machines. Pool with views of the mountains."
5156,1070274,5,JeffKLunn,26/09/2020,"Absolutely stunning peaceful location which is well signposted and getting there using the coordinations is no problem. Direct access from the main road and then a drive up a mountain track, easy even in a large motorhome. Very friendly and welcoming with all the facilities you need, including serviced pitches and a swimming pool, to enjoy a quiet stay. This is not a site for noisy families but a beautiful clam place to stay and unwind in the most stunning scenery close to nature. Make sure you have done your shopping before you arrive and then simply put your feet up and relax. Highly recommend this place but hope when we return it is still as quiet and we can still get a pitch..!"
5156,947347,2,Primpos,10/08/2020,"In line with other reviews I read here. We have spent one night. Stone access but you can get there well. The caravan area is good and services ok. Now, we have been very uncomfortable. The owners are continually watching what you do, you feel like you are bothering about everything, they even entered the bathrooms to watch. We have felt worse treated for being Spanish the truth - they only spoke French and some English. The area is good but the feeling has been very bad, a shame since the site is not bad. If you are a French or Swiss retiree and want silence, this is the ideal place. If you are a Spanish family with children, it is not the best place."
5156,931484,5,AgatheAndJu,05/08/2020,Great place !! Very warm welcome from Antonio. Top swimming pool and sanitary facilities! Perfect for a short stopover.
5156,797418,4,Mmmoustic,26/03/2020,"Too bad, closed cause covid!"
5156,782301,4,ElVeterano,18/02/2020,"The nicest aire we have stayed on anywhere. Some have been there so long they are on first name terms. The lady who patrols the site is OK , but she is a stickler for her rules to be obeyed, which was fine with us. Do Not under any circumstances go into the pool area with shoes on! A fairly easy walk up to the thermal spa. Expensive and you are more likely to get a place if you speak French."
5156,770000,5,RenardGrisL,18/01/2020,"After 1 km of stone path you will find a small, very nice motorhome area, an oasis of calm. Swimming pool, showers, extremely clean toilets. Great camping atmosphere and spontaneous mutual help. Often meals shared between campers. This nugget of camping is to visit, we come by chance, but we stay by conviction. I will come back to it ..."
5156,751356,1,diezweilustigendrei,08/12/2019,"Arrived we had the impudence to occupy a free parking space. We also went wrong and had to rank on instructions. This stupid permanent camper from OSL-DD spoiled our stay from the first second. Space costs 15 €, is too narrow and the wifi is fluctuating. The operator should pay more attention to his Dauercamper. Do not drive, better to SP Alferce"
5156,721626,5,velivole,14/10/2019,Really beautiful area. The owners speak French.
5156,642660,5,Kika76,19/08/2019,"Perfect place !! Quiet in the mountains. Very nice home. Toilets, hot showers. The must have a pool with views of the mountains! Evacuations gray water, black water, water supply. Nothing to say. To recommend!!!"
5156,623882,5,Tanruz,13/08/2019,"Everything has been said, a place that we recommend."
5156,621248,2,ferdiamor,12/08/2019,"Quiet area, with beautiful views, although mostly burned mountains, with a well-kept pool, which gives it greater attractiveness. The services are very good and clean. The access is bad for AC since it is a dirt track with stones. The biggest drawback is that the person who attends to him although kind was chasing us all the time, watching what we were doing and this got to bother us. The treatment of other guests seemed less intimidating, I don't know if they were known or because they were not Spanish. It was very windy at night."
5156,582943,5,jean38,29/07/2019,"Great place !! very good home, nice owner, possibility of hiking, beautiful pool, everything is available and clean. I recommend this location and I will come back ..."
5156,580616,1,magicwood,28/07/2019,"Hello the pitches are very good water draining individual electricity the problem the owner and a person living on the spot are constantly behind you, is tiring. good road."
5156,468437,5,josy47,26/04/2019,"A warm welcome, a dream place to spend a moment of peace and serenity, take a path a little stony but the place is worth seeing. Thank you for preserving this beautiful site despite some hot events, we will come back"
5156,448103,5,jpo.neuville,02/04/2019,"Aire with all the services in full Nature for a very quiet night. If you want to stay a few days, arrive with your food except bread, the baker spends the morning at 9:00."
5156,447714,5,REPLA,01/04/2019,"Well, the best place? Great location with everything you would like as a long-term guest. Limited number of parking spaces. Reservation is also recommended to save an ambitious journey. Technology is functional self-construction. Family atmosphere."
5156,446417,1,indiecamperas,29/03/2019,"Unfriendly, unwelcoming and hostile. Appeared very cramped. The campsite was full and we asked if we could pay to just use the shower but we were told we were not allowed. Not an inclusive environment for budding young campers like us. We found a much nicer area to camp 20 mins away."
5156,437847,5,RenardGrisL,08/03/2019,"Very friendly welcome in French, German, English and Portuguese. Family atmosphere between campers. Often meals with all campers. Great, the real life of a camper. Thank you for your kindness, especially to Isabelle!"
5156,432205,5,rokar57,22/02/2019,"Home super nice French, beautiful area with all amenities"
5156,410256,5,rosieandbenx,26/11/2018,"This place is absolutely breathtaking. It’s got everything you could possibly want, including a pool. The lady at reception is an absolute darling and nothing is any trouble. The track up here isn’t so bad despite what people say, we have come across far far worse. Will definitely be staying again. €12.50 for 2 people hooked up to electrics for 1 night."
5156,388113,5,goldgege,05/10/2018,"A haven of peace and serenity between the beaches of the West and the South. Do not miss it for anything in the world. All services, kindness and all for a very reasonable price."
5156,376841,5,Klunthack,18/09/2018,"Nice little place with all the trimmings, even a small pool. Super well maintained and clean. Absolute peace and relaxation. For those who want to come down times the right place. Great location. The journey is a bit adventurous"
5156,340946,1,CharMarsh,18/08/2018,Closed due to fires in the region - no electric. 18/8/18
5156,309028,5,Dreamer33,31/07/2018,"Super welcome. Site very well thought out and functional (with showers, toilets and crockery). Swimming pool very nice (despite the wind). To recommend."
5156,258843,3,haukeh1,25/05/2018,"Unfortunately a bit too much hyped place. really nice location with a view of the mountains. However, the mobile like sardines are in the box. In addition, only very few places. Reservation is meaningful, as a arrival and departure, which was free of charge was annoying. Only cash payment possible. Cost for 2 children 4y and 6y and 2 adults 18 €. there are big campingpl cheaper. unsuitable for children."
5156,256306,1,MrandMrsAdventure,20/05/2018,"Extremely rude. Do not stay here. Places are all squished together too. And you must drive 3km up a very steep, rough and rocky road. The manager is aweful."
5156,248884,4,fano49,08/05/2018,"Well equipped for small combi, access pool shower nice."
5156,238881,5,MuPat,20/04/2018,No negative points ... except perhaps the few places proposed. But this is probably what allows this great friendliness with both the guests and other motorhome. Strongly recommended.
5156,235809,5,robrose,12/04/2018,"Heartwarming welcome. On request, we can deliver croissants and baguette (""French"" tells us the owner). Cleanliness and health of a remarkable cleanliness. Certainly almost two km of climbing on an unpaved road, but, up there, what a pleasure."
5156,226086,5,pmc.ld,06/03/2018,A remarkable area both by its location and by its equipment and warm welcome. The track to access it is very rolling. Relaxed atmosphere. Absolute calm. View of the surrounding mountains. Thanks to Isabelle for her hiking tips (Picota!). A real playground for nature lovers! We will come back...
5156,221661,5,Twinnie,06/02/2018,"After visiting the beaches of the Algarve but loaded with tourists nevertheless very beautiful we decided to return to the hinterland and direction Monchique. We want to spend the night, and choose a service area that follows a stony path. A surprise awaits us indeed, at the top of a small coast a few ""youkas"" welcome us and wow! A paradise on earth ... A marvel. Warm welcome by both the owner and the camper family atmosphere quiet, surrounded by lush vegetation, we discover the site. Very well laid out, practical, nicely decorated, only happiness. We will come back"
5156,220526,4,alpaga56,28/01/2018,"Indeed super area only for lovers of deep nature and mountain walks. In addition, it must be earned by undergoing a rise of 1 km by a road in a pebble where crossings are really to avoid. I understand the anger of the German who got there high finds the complete area. In any case to avoid for a simple drain ah ah ah ;-)"
5156,220249,1,hans85,26/01/2018,Hello. very bad for larger campers. apart from that bad access. when oncoming traffic is very tight. the best is that if everything is full you will learn this on site. not suitable for spontaneity. a small sign in the driveway would be great here and would help a lot.
5156,216771,5,gilbertliard,31/12/2017,"31/12/2017 arrived yesterday for one evening, finally we will leave on 2/1/2018. When we are on the road and we see the signs indicating the area we expect the worst. Is hell at the end of the road badly stony? May paradise be won! Enthusiastic crowded campers like Olhão or Albufeira go your way as the disappointment will be great, lovers of peace, nature and an almost family atmosphere. Go for it! Best of all, dogs have the right to be free. A real joy !"
5156,215445,5,ankewolz,21/12/2017,"Beautifully designed place with high comfort. Baguette service in the morning. Very quiet, depending on the place also overlooking the sea. Good hiking area."
5156,206538,5,DigitalNomad,27/10/2017,"Very nice quiet place, with spectacular sunsets and sunsets. Fresh water, sewage and electrics in every place! Wifi signal not everywhere. 4 bars in the MEO 4G network. Very nice swimming pool with great views, however, the flat rate extra per day will be charged (15 Eur with, 12.50 without pool, including 2 people including electricity)."
5156,203747,4,zorrock,17/10/2017,"GPS coordinates random but very well indicated of the road, super area and super hiking around (PR2)"

5156,197999,5,flodel,26/09/2017,"Very nice area very clean very spacious and very quiet. Yes far from everything but so calm. For nature lovers, one of the most comfortable areas is perfect. The boss is nice speaks French well. If all the campsites could be at the height of this place which is far from being the case. Cheap 12,50 € with water and electricity for 2. No dirt is dragging on the floor."
5156,195327,4,Robertocampo,19/09/2017,"Extending my review, say about the price, despite having some very good facilities, perhaps something excessive given the distance from the place. Prices are: € 15 per motorhome with 2 people and € 5 each additional person. That is, a motorhome with 4 people is € 25 / day (includes electricity and water). The area also has a washing machine, swimming pool, bathrooms and showers."
5156,183045,5,jean38,23/08/2017,"Nothing to say about this area. Very welcome, very quiet in the countryside, I will return without hesitation. For apb17800 who talks about the owner's bad dog, he does not say in his review that it is his pit bull that was aggressive and uncontrolled. We were there and I admit that we were worried about our 2 children. Thank you to the owner for asking him to leave, serious place"
5156,180802,4,papoumette,20/08/2017,"Very well! calm, nicely arranged, wild site, a little distant from the village. .."
5156,180397,2,apb17800,20/08/2017,"The area looks very nice but we could not stay because the owner's dog apparently does not support other dogs and his master obviously does not see why, he should keep it away, too bad we have from"
5156,176022,5,evom,15/08/2017,"Great home with humor, impeccable pool, clean sanitary clean without smell! washing machine price for 3 € night price for 2 persons 14 € with electricity, location facing the valley when the mechanics and ingenuity are the services of the motorhome. Bravo to recommend"

5156,151591,4,Atacama,14/07/2017,"Area in full nature perfectly equipped for a good report quality price. Passed in 2009, we had the pleasure of cooling off in the new pool. Very good reception and excellent attendance. Must pass to reach the coast."
5156,151336,4,CristinaLlamas,13/07/2017,Very clean and quiet area. Positive: pool. Environment. New bathrooms Negative: bad dirt road for a large vehicle. There is not much shadow (in the pool either). Price a little expensive.
5156,143272,5,laretraite63,15/06/2017,The most beautiful area of Portugal. Maria Isabelle and Antonio do what it takes to make the stay the most enjoyable.
5156,118374,5,robynwakefield,15/01/2017,Absolute gem of a site and well worth the trek up a steep gravel track. Vans of up to 8m here. All services available. Quiet and calm atmosphere. Fantastic view and walking. Visited Jan 2017.
5156,113893,4,Carioca976,10/11/2016,Very welcome (in French like that already been said). A nice quiet place with all the services. To recommend without hesitation.
5156,110363,5,jpc38410,17/10/2016,"We only stayed one night but I highly recommend this place. Welcomed by Isabelle who speaks French. Comfortable for us. A quiet place. With water, electricity and drain included in the price. Sanitary flawless. Nothing to say for the price if only to spend a few days to enjoy it. Personally, I recommend .."
5156,101709,5,5415nadine,30/08/2016,"Since the opening of this park, we settle there every year and for several weeks because the place is idyllic and the welcome very warm. This is the best value for money I have stayed at and many more expensive campsites should be inspired. It's all inclusive except the washing machine but you have the smile of the boss. The facilities are modern (water, electricity, sewage disposal on site) and the facilities are very clean. The little extra of this year: a magnificent swimming pool. If I could, I will stay there all year."
5156,100989,5,pascalou21,28/08/2016,"The best equipped among all those already visited. Those who say the opposite are really bad sleepers. Everything is on each site, water, electricity, emptying, no need to move the motorhome. Nice little pool well equipped too. Impeccable sanitary facilities. And on request the croissants and the bread placed on the table when you get up! The TOP !!"

She acts as the hostess to unload Antonio who always goes about making an improvement to this place. Thank you for this very warm welcome."
5156,89702,5,emm03,05/08/2016,Please note the area is on the right before Caldas de Monchique coming from the south. Really very good
5156,89372,4,freddumont,04/08/2016,"I confirm everything that has been said: boss a little grumpy but what an area, top equipment and very clean. just a downside for the hot water in the showers but given the outside temperature it was rather pleasant. very windy yesterday 3/8/2016, for information additional person €3 for 5 people €20.5"
5156,80624,5,jean38,10/07/2016,"Beautiful place quiet, nothing to say about the cleanliness and hospitality, the owner speaks French, possibility of having fresh bread in the morning, beautiful pool with a magnificent view, place that I recommend, bravo."
5156,76058,5,romeonethen,08/06/2016,"Everything is very very top. Very very well signposted from the national road. Don't be frightened by the road that leads there from the main road: no surface, dusty but perfectly safe."
5156,72397,5,blap,09/05/2016,"For those who love nature and simplicity (and flee the great herd migrations of camper vans) Friendly welcome, after a first visit on 7/5/2016 we returned on 9/05. For the rest everything is said in Tornjak's comment"

5156,57298,5,Atacama,11/10/2015,"I experienced this campervan welcome in June 2009 and already, it was great for the welcome, the facilities and the environment. The owner bought this quarry and created this campsite. The view on the horizon is magnificent. We will come back to this."
5156,55928,4,Lucie5688,24/09/2015,"Indeed it is magnificent! We went there just to shower, drain our water and took the opportunity to eat lunch since the scenery is still worth the detour! Owner who speaks French. We paid €12.50 for all that without spending the night, I don't know if it's more expensive. Very quiet place, the showers and toilets are impeccable, in short perfect!!"
5156,39901,4,D.Dufaux,25/06/2015,The boss has responsibilities in tourism in Portugal. This explains the impeccable quality of this area.

5156,38947,5,pjpymartin,12/06/2015,"Perfect motorhome area. It is necessary to rectify the latitude and longitude points which do not lead to the area. It is in fact latitude point N37 ° 16'36 ""and longitude point W08 ° 32'36"". Perfect to rest from the noise of the Algarve."
5156,35894,5,elmanah,09/05/2015,"I had to stay one night and I have been there for a week and I would not want to leave! It is a very small campsite and for that it remains family. Quiet place, relaxing ideal to relax before taking the road."

5156,30934,5,Tornjak,03/02/2015,"In the mountain at the heart of nature, this extraordinary area is worth the detour for the quality of its exceptional services or each location offers a wonderful and dominant viewpoint. Ideally located for rest, hiking and fresh air, those who discover this place of conviviality do not want to leave! Pitches a bit limited to my taste: - Flat and very stable they are individually equipped with an electrical connection, an EP valve and an EU evacuation. Wifi / TV reception / connection maximum: - Including the most distant locations from the reception with regard to the wifi Sanitary cleanliness: - Spacious cabins, equipped with coat hooks, curtain in the individual shower cabin - Washing linen and dryer available (3 € / token) The very practicable dirt road from the national deserves to be apprehended with attention. Nevertheless I returned to the area without any difficulty with a camper truck heavy 8 meters. On site the sites are almost all occupied including 1 by a camper over 9 meters. The creator of this great environment is extremely helpful. He masters among others, perfectly French. Nearby, the village of Monchique offers all logistical services essential to everyday life."
5156,29969,4,zelob,25/12/2014,"Transit 13 and 13/11/14. Only one place left when we arrived. Area in the countryside, friendly French. Sanitary clean. Price 12.5 € with free wifi. Paying washing machine 3 €"

5223,3269778,5,nicoetlolo,07/09/2023,"one of the prettiest if not the prettiest we've done even if it's rare that we go camping! very atypical seen on the sea if you are lucky enough to have a location there, pleasant staff. expensive but still reasonable given the 45th night camping for two in a van! it seems to me that it remains one of the most affordable in the area."
5223,3039998,5,TonyMar,29/07/2023,"I loved it, choose a good plot and enjoy the stay, perfect last week of July."

Near Bus stop that takes you to Tarragona Excellent. Highly recommended!!"

Only downside for me, difficulty of maneuvering for a CC of 7m on a small plot certainly shaded but under the pines, full of resin droplets from the 1st night!!! . Some regulars cover their vehicles with plastic sheets to avoid all this resin. Tarragona to do by bus or bike"
5223,2858539,4,FrankyKaren,15/06/2023,Everything very clean and well-kept. Right on a beautiful beach. Spontaneously got a seat in the second row. It was 20m to the beach. Two good restaurants around the corner. Great price €22.50 with ADAC card. Gladly again.
5223,2781758,4,EricGerard,24/05/2023,"Superb view of the sea. Accepts asci, very affordable: 44€ for 2 nights cc with electricity and 2 people. 10 km from Tarragona by bike. Quiet place on the heights. Good welcome. Rather small space, excessive grocery prices. Clean toilets. It's not family friendly because it's too big. The Spaniards are sometimes noisy."
5223,2676537,4,catetphiphi50,17/04/2023,"very pleasant campsite, grocery store with fresh bread from 8 a.m., direct access to the beach, beautiful walk on the coastal path to go to Tamarit one star less for access to certain pitches complicated depending on the size of the motorhome well marked the number chosen with respect to access otherwise everything is OK"
5223,2663467,4,alien62,12/04/2023,"beautiful place by the sea with many squares for tents and bungalows not suitable for large campers, all excellent services with pizzeria and friendly staff. beautiful panoramic terrace with the old stone tower"
5223,2437531,5,sterchi,11/10/2022,Wonderful campsite on a beautiful beach. Have been here many times. Keep coming back. Sanitary facilities clean and well maintained. staff friendly. Price with ACSI 20€ plus tourist tax.
5223,2382429,2,jonas0493,18/09/2022,"We spontaneously got a place with a great view of the water from the tower at the top. The staff were very nice. Unfortunately we can't report anything else positive. The campsite itself is very large. Dogs are not allowed in the restaurant area or on the beach. Sanitary facilities are quickly dirty due to the many people, and it also stinks of chemical toilets."
5223,2377436,1,jeanflo,16/09/2022,"Yes it can be near the sea and large swimming pool etc....but September 15th so today, it's three nights compulsory...certainly booked by groups and tour operators....so we went elsewhere."
5223,2009272,5,Sandrachallenger,25/06/2022,"Highly recommended campsite, with a large pool and direct access to the beach."
5223,1918003,5,goodvans,26/05/2022,"Really loved this place, only €25 a night for a medium sized van with two people in May. They gave us a beautiful spot on the cliff overlooking the sea. Great pool and facilities and 5 minutes walk to the beach, everything you could need!"
5223,1911414,4,mrfragger,24/05/2022,Very good place. Direct access to the sea.
5223,1839485,2,le-vallerot,19/04/2022,"Good welcome but Campsite with services not up to the price €54/day for 1 C.car 4 adults electricity constantly tripping!! Of course near the sea, supermarket, swimming pool. At this price the wifi is not even included ??? More exactly we have the right to 1GB but we have to go to a specific place of the campsite and the 4G is non-existent as soon as we enter the campsite!! amazing!"
5223,1385876,3,Patyna,31/07/2021,"Looks good but they asked for €98 on a camper with 3 kids, so we left."
5223,1365374,5,Mirennn,26/07/2021,"Very good campsite with direct access to the beach. Plots of all kinds, with little shade and views, with lots of shade in the area of trees, large, small ... there are also different types of bungalows. There is a shop, a bar, a gym, a very large pool with hot water. It is an expensive campsite in summer but in line with this area."
5223,1355483,4,Remolin,23/07/2021,"Very good camping, but with motorhomes of a certain size it can be difficult"
5223,1301337,3,jusualli,06/07/2021,"Very clean place, huge and sometimes with a great view over the beach, but quite angled. Huge pool & direct access to the beach. We were only there for one night and found it extremely expensive, hence the star deduction. 47 EUR for a campervan with 2 adults + 2 children (3 and 6 years) and we didn't even stand in the first row, that would have cost 6 EUR more."
5223,1241236,5,PatrickSchmelz,07/06/2021,I will definitely come back. Totally great campsite and that for 19 € the night. (Womo and 1 person) Had a nice view from the pitch of the bay even without booking the first row (7 €). Sanitary is inclusive and super clean. Gym is also beautiful and the price including washing machine costs 5 and was great. The beaches and the sea were also very clean.
5223,1207375,5,MartKlifman,20/05/2021,"Perfect camping in my opinion. Clean, nice staff, well maintained and all facilities available on the camping: Big pool, restaurant,  gym, places right to the beach, wasmachines etc. 

Price 25 euros if you want a place right next to the beach, 20 for normal place. 

Only downside is biking to Tarragona, no bike lanes (as usual in Spain) so you have to use the N-road (which was ok for us)."
5223,1200841,4,joan777,16/05/2021,"Good campsite with many services and very clean. There are plots on the beachfront. € 25, 2pax per night."

5223,590709,5,ojacqz,01/08/2019,"Excellent home. From the square in high season for 4 nights without reservation for a van and 2 people with electricity. Camping comfort with the view and more. Supermarket, restaurant, snack, swimming pool, beautiful beach, not to mention sanitary facilities that are clean in view of the crowds and people who do not even know how to draw a flush ..... It is paid: 62.5 € per night."

5223,513985,5,MiTonTour,13/06/2019,"Wonderfully located place, great pool area (actually superfluous, because direct beach location). Many rented tents and mobile homes. International audience. Currently almost completely occupied, but still relatively quiet and relaxed."
5223,497025,4,Walek,30/05/2019,"A beautiful campsite with a breathtaking view of the bay of Tarragona. The access is a bit difficult (tree roots, narrow, and by a street almost in a forbidden direction ... a van passes but a big motorhome will have trouble). For € 19 a night without electricity, it's worth it. The pool is good, and the restaurant ok. Sanitary clean, heated. Once again, the view is breathtaking."
5223,456715,5,Elainad,16/04/2019,"Great! It is fabulous! Camping with sea view! Very nice and open reception in the reception and a parking space with a view of the bay. Just beautiful! Nice neighbors, beautiful view, wonderful area - everything was great! We stay longer than planned, simply because it's so unexpectedly beautiful!"

5223,382115,5,yoyo06,25/09/2018,"Very nice campsite with swimming pool, beautiful, the restaurant is good and cheap with sea view. For just one night, I pay 25 euros van plus electricity, a bit expensive but great camping. The bathrooms are very clean and the view is breathtaking."
5223,367761,3,LOLO0204,08/09/2018,"Very nice campsite, very clean, just the cold showers. We are not camping but saw the comments of theft on motorhomes at night, we preferred this option 30 € per night for two van with electricity. We spent the evening at the campsite restaurant, with flamenco night, very good but a bit noisy, it's the camping atmosphere."
5223,365818,4,Moewe,05/09/2018,"Camping top. Especially in the off season. Well-kept sanitary facilities, many places available (reservation not necessary), however, sometimes with very small plots, pool, evening entertainment. If you decide to spend the night, I recommend the waikiki Beach, which can be reached by a short adventure hike along the cliffs."
5223,353941,5,McHeck,26/08/2018,Perfect location. Magnificent over the bay.
5223,277233,5,tcm,29/06/2018,"The campsite par excellence. Superb pool, clean, large, direct access to the beach in small cove intimate. Choice of location upon arrival. Nice staff and French speaking. Take away at the restaurant bar at a very very reasonable price. Shower and toilet impeccable. We had to stay one night we did two. We will return. And little more: a playground for children and the sea not very deep at the beach loan which facilitates when you have children"
5223,195650,1,sofianie68,19/09/2017,"High rates, sloping campsite, shabby location with no space, difficult to access, impossible to see, cold shower only"

5223,158523,4,Atacama,26/07/2017,"Camping beautifully located and well structured. On a hill facing the sea. Clean sanitary despite the summer affluence. Good location in the shade and without noise. But it is paid: 124,70 € for 2 nights. (Electricity 6A for 5.75 € / day) Everything is very well designed, splendid pool, bar, restaurant and entertainment. Mini supermarket with bread etc. Admirable beach and hikes to do."
5223,138212,1,honeypoo,27/05/2017,"We urgently needed a space for our car because it was broken. A truck would have brought us there so we could sleep but they didn't allow us. No sleeping in cars on site is allowed. I even explained that we have curtains and a small tent/roof in front but they didn't care at all.
No help, no support, not recommended!"
5223,115438,5,yeuc,04/12/2016,"Great campsite, lover on a hill under the pines with direct access to a beautiful beach. Only downside, the campsite is on a hill so it goes up and it goes down pretty bad!"
5223,104623,5,heli,11/09/2016,"A privileged place The views of the Costa Daurada are exceptional. In low season the prices are adjusted. The facilities, good. Spectacular pool But the best thing is the plots facing the sea."

5223,89446,4,tibo44,04/08/2016,"Very good campsite, location ok even without reserving. The ideal is of course a reservation with a location of your choice. Beach nearby and beautiful landscape, swimming pool, restaurants, € 470 for 6 nights with electricity. California with 2 adults and 2 children"

5223,47158,5,mymyl,08/08/2015,"For me it's a faultless! You can stay 3 weeks without moving your motorhome, you will find everything on site: Swimming pool, super market, bar, restaurant, ready meals, beach ""private"", public beaches and restaurants within walking distance .... Locations with views the sea under the pines !!!! Small walk by the sea on foot or by bike. I recommend, it's really worth pushing your way a little further than just crossing the border for the ""Costa Brava"" ..."
5223,38153,4,gg56,31/05/2015,"Very good campsite with the beach next door, however access to the sites is often a problem for motorhomes longer than 7 m. A public bus at 2.80 € goes to Tarragona."

5461,3251229,5,Agust1960,02/09/2023,perfect place a little far from the center but behind the Plaza Leon Shopping Center the bus 13 or 11 leaves...you get off at Ramon y Cajal and it is perfect for going up a wide street. We took a skewer at the Rebote specialist croquettes. The area is quiet and flat without unevenness.
5461,3248102,5,MarkAm,02/09/2023,"Excellent location, super large parking. When we arrived all the spaces were occupied but we parked in the paid area without parking for ourselves and other motorhomes and campers. Thank you León for thinking about our group"
5461,3242635,5,Andrea87,31/08/2023,"20 minutes from the center. Small shopping center with Mercadona supermarket in front. A self-service laundry is two minutes walk away. While we did our laundry we stopped to eat at the Chorco brewery, highly recommended. They have a terrace in the square behind the establishment with shade and space for children to play, delicious and cheap food. The service of 10."
5461,3238127,3,BelgianAussie,30/08/2023,"Good location. It really fills up. When we arrived there was no available place in the free Motorhome places. We decided to sit and wait, people do move out quite frequently, but parking inspector came and we were instructed to buy a ticket. €2.80 for 24 hours, machine takes coin but gives no change, or contactless card. Soon we were able to move, but we also had a ticket."
5461,3228821,3,Tanruz,28/08/2023,It stays near the center and the environment was not noisy during the night.

5461,3174731,3,MonicaGarciaDiaz,18/08/2023,"Urban area but with a river walk behind it that makes it more pleasant. Walking downtown without problem. Next to San Marcos. To visit León, a good place with all the services."
5461,3168796,5,martavt,17/08/2023,"Of the three areas of León I have only slept in this one. Grateful for places like this, a short walk from the center, with a supermarket in front and peace of mind to sleep."
5461,3140928,5,Eugezena,13/08/2023,"Quiet and convenient area to get to the center, shopping center in front and area on the river behind where they play sports. Quiet area, in the evening many campers parked in the car area."

Note that the staff of the parking meter company will be there at 10:00 like a nail. We spent the night very quiet, no noise even when it was full."
5461,3128496,5,Judrov4,12/08/2023,"Very good area to visit the center. If you arrive in the afternoon around 8:00 p.m., you may not find a place in the parking lots for AC. However, you can leave it in the car spaces, but BE CAREFUL to look at the parking meter when you should start paying the next morning, since some colleagues were fined at 9:01. Otherwise 100% recommended."

It is next to a cafeteria, restaurant, where they are very friendly. Next to the river, with the possibility of walking along the banks, full of trees. Not far from the center of León."

Despite the close proximity to the city, the place was quiet and right on a river with a great opportunity to go for a walk. Restaurant on site, but we didn't use it. Unfortunately it was very hot and there was hardly any shade, but for the free possibility to park it was still ok!"
5461,3044756,5,ABUELA84,30/07/2023,"Thanks to the city council of Leon for making it easier for us to stay, 3 free areas. Area with some shade, 15 minutes walk from the center. With filling and emptying of water. Supermarket and galleries opposite. The saddest thing is to arrive and find 2 large garbage bags next to a tree, with containers nearby even for recycling. Then we have a reputation for pigs because of some gili."
5461,3039906,1,kiwo,29/07/2023,"Clogged sewage drain, shit comes out of the drinking water drain, a giant mess, we were able to get water, busy area and little space to park, we went to the university."

5461,2775795,4,GandT,22/05/2023,"Great central park up if you are lucky to get a space. We arrived at 10am with just 2 spaces free, each time someone left the space was quickly filled. At night after the cars have left the place continued to fill up with motorhome after motorhome until no more space can be found. For 1 night and a day looking round the city, it was a good detour. Thank you, every city should have such spaces."

The parking space is located directly in front of a shopping center, so that there are toilets nearby, at least during opening hours. It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the historic center of Léon. It was very quiet at night."
5461,2467474,4,DaniGaliza,28/10/2022,Good place although a bit noisy to spend the night. 5 minutes from the town centre. As you have cars parked in front and cars to the side it is difficult to get out and park (I am 7m). The trees touch in the back. Good water service etc. Maximum ecstasy 48h.
5461,2420822,5,ouzyyy,03/10/2022,"Caravan area very close to the center. Many spaces, some reserved only for motorhomes, so it is easy to find a place. Drinking water service, gray and black water in very good condition and free. Very flat seats. Next door there is a shopping center and supermarket. The only thing is that the road next to it is very busy."
5461,2377134,4,BenvandenBerg,16/09/2022,Place to visit the city from the center . It is a pure place and space is limited and you cannot recreate there. Free parking etc. It is a popular place because often full.
5461,2362450,5,maxmstrmann,11/09/2022,"Good pitch for visiting Leòn. The rear part of the parking lot is reserved for campers. Opposite is a shopping center including a supermarket. I walked to the old town (about 15 minutes) and you pass very nice cafes and bars along the way. I've been craving fast food for a long time and ordered something through UberEats, but there are also a few restaurants."
5461,2354996,4,paquito,09/09/2022,"Good location for visiting the city. 10mm from the Convent of San Marco! Opposite the CCial Léon Gran Plaza. For the record, appearances are deceiving, there is just a supermarket which is very good and upstairs a very large Chinese store where you can find everything at low prices, that's all. Convenient, free and quiet night! Thanks to Leon. FYI there are 3 CCAR areas in the city! Cheer."
5461,2320564,4,lelu23,30/08/2022,"As an area to spend the night it is fine, in front of a shopping center. The cathedral is about a 20-25 minute walk away. It has an area for emptying water."
5461,2293717,5,filoumen,24/08/2022,"Short stop on the return from vacation in Portugal. Nickel to visit the city, certainly the places are all taken but possible to put it aside by being discreet and respectful."

5461,2264841,4,Alvor,19/08/2022,"Area very well located to visit Leon, very busy so if you arrive late it will hardly take place, has some trees that give a little shade, free services. It has a shopping center with a Mercadona in front. In some places it can be complicated to enter/exit the place because the circulation space between the motorhomes and the parked cars is very narrow."
5461,2264640,5,cellentano,18/08/2022,Great pitch to stay overnight. Very crowded in summer but still quiet

Bit of road noise until around 2:00 am, but to be expected  near centre.
Municipal swimming pools are great (€2.20 day and a free shower), 12 mins by bike.

5461,1960883,4,timbarnard,09/06/2022,"It's a decent M/H parking with services about 20mins walk from the historic city, as people have said a bit tight for larger vehicles but doable. Be careful to park in designated M/H spaces which are free. I observed 2 M/Hs parked in car spaces being fined by traffic warden."
5461,1949713,4,micky57,05/06/2022,"Area well located for visiting the city in front of a car park. Location a bit short for large vehicles Quiet at night. Very busy this weekend, no more room. Some CCs are parked in the car park..."

5461,1925145,5,Parky57,28/05/2022,Does what it says on the tin. Highly recommend for visiting all the interesting places in Leon. Gets full by mid afternoon. Good facilities for emptying and refills.
5461,1921631,4,frannetpat,27/05/2022,Very close to town. Impeccable service. Lots of c.car tonight.
5461,1919247,4,Franquilo,26/05/2022,The site is very fair to maneuver. But it is worth it to visit this beautiful city.

5461,1893142,5,noeliita,16/05/2022,"Very good area, you can spend the night and the filling and emptying of water works great, which is appreciated since sometimes filling the van is an odyssey. very good location"
5461,1892882,3,juankein,15/05/2022,"Central and quiet area. It has a problem: as long as they park on the sides and there are cars in the squares in front, you can't get out."
5461,1886236,4,dennislinda,12/05/2022,"Great location for visiting the city. Stood with WoWa attached for one night with no problems. water available. Actually WoMo parking space, but didn't bother the WoMos or the traffic wardens. A bit noisy due to night traffic on the adjacent streets. Do not build or put anything outside, only parking is allowed. Opposite toilet in the shopping mall and shopping/bars en masse."
5461,1878912,4,franjgr,09/05/2022,"I give it four stars because of the location, very close to everything and because it has all the services, but they are converted parking spaces (extended in width), in a car park. Short spaces, we occupy the rear pavement although it is not used either except by us and the nose protrudes from the front, the corridors are also narrow and we have to maneuver, watch out for the trees."
5461,1872991,4,viajandogeral,06/05/2022,"Excellent place, worth allowing only 24 hours, a lot of movement of both cars and people, next to the park. Thanks to the city for the place."
5461,1862712,5,ivoderooij,01/05/2022,"Super free place to visit the city. we arrived in the afternoon and there was still plenty of room. If the Camperplaats is full, you can also park the camper in the paid parking lot for the night and then move it before 10 o'clock in the morning. because from 10 o'clock you have to pay there."
5461,1861979,4,micealh,30/04/2022,"Stayed on Friday 22/04/22. Arrived late morning and finding a place was not difficult. However, the site was busy and some motor homes used two places in the adjacent car park. I can imagine that ordinary car park users might be annoyed, especially as they are paying to park and campers are not. Facilities as described."
5461,1858358,5,jomaduga,28/04/2022,"Magnificent area 15 minutes walk from the historic center and the wet neighborhood. Paved, leveled and with the services it offers working properly. Shopping center just opposite. It is not easy to find a place. He sleeps peacefully."
5461,1852449,5,Salva1960,25/04/2022,"Good location, 25 motorhomes enter, on cement, leveled and good emptying and filling water service. Gratuitous. Within the area there is parking for cars and payment for said vehicles. Next to the Mercadona. The cathedral about 1.8 km. walking for a nice walk. Thanks to the León City Council."
5461,1833735,4,viajamos,18/04/2022,"Few places for those of us who are already, but thanks Leon for keeping us in mind, the area is ideal to visit, close and well connected (wonderful)."
5461,1825608,5,Mirisanta,15/04/2022,"Although it is full, the place is very good, although there are quite a few pitotes between cars, campers and motorhomes. An overnight zone would be fine. Leon incredible, very good atmosphere and very nice. Humid neighborhood essential visit. We will be back."
5461,1816800,5,MARIANFDEZFDEZ,12/04/2022,"Good area near the center of the city, with a shopping center in front and a good promenade next to the river behind, to get a seat you have to arrive in the morning, which is when there is more movement, if there is no room in the designated spaces, you can sleep in the parking lot, they don't say anything but in this case from 10 o'clock you have to put a ticket"
5461,1813472,5,WhiteTomato,10/04/2022,Great parking to visit León. Walking distance to the cozy town and Mercadona in the mall right next door. Filling and emptying works fine. Just make sure you park in the specific RV sites. The other places are paid places.
5461,1812760,4,mchicoc,10/04/2022,"The area is full and like double the ac and fires in the parking spaces of our cars. When the shopping center closes, a few cars are cleared. More places would be needed, otherwise perfect to visit the city. Be careful, in my car spaces there is ORA parking from Monday to Friday and Saturdays until noon. Being near a busy road there is quite a bit of noise, but normal for a city."
5461,1807023,5,cva-iramola,05/04/2022,"Perfect area to visit the city, a few minutes walk from the center. There is a commercial area to do the shopping, also an area to have a few beers or have dinner. It is usually quite busy."

5461,1798493,5,Raymond_HH,28/03/2022,"The place is as often described. Despite being in the middle of the city, surprisingly quiet even for a Monday morning. We had a wonderful night there and were sure to fill up. Within walking distance to the wonderful old town with its sights, bars and restaurants. Leon is definitely worth a visit."
5461,1797898,5,VeraLis,27/03/2022,"Happy to find these areas in capitals. It is 20 minutes from the center. All services, there are many places. You have the option of leaving it in the car park, paying a very cheap price of €2 every 4 hours, if you don't have a place. In front there is a shopping center with a Mercadona and bathrooms. Behind, there is a path next to the river, very nice, where they let dogs walk without a leash. It's great."
5461,1794800,5,frema26,25/03/2022,"Everything has been said, thanks to the city"
5461,1793170,4,jubelle31,23/03/2022,"March 2, 2022. Stop simply for services and shopping at the mercadona just opposite. Services are efficient and parking is free for Ccamping cars for 48 hours"

5461,1782125,5,raultxo.79,13/03/2022,"Very well located area, in front of a shopping center, with a mercadona. It is 15.20 min walk from the center. It has filling and emptying, it does not have electricity. to put something wrong, the area is inside a parking lot, and the spaces are a little narrow."
5461,1779942,4,bkb,11/03/2022,"Free area, on the banks of the Rio Bernesga (pretty promenade) and opposite the León Plaza shopping centre. Quick access on foot to the Casco antiguo. Free water and garbage. Quiet night. In addition to the cathedral and the city's monuments, don't miss the surprising visit to Gaudi's Casa Botines."
5461,1768118,5,rgp,27/02/2022,"An extraordinary area in every way. Ground, with black and gray service, fifteen minutes walk from the old town and five utos from the Museum of Modern Art. With a cafe next door and a mall with a supermarket two minutes away. Great for parking and seeing Burgos."
5461,1757051,5,CARPAT,15/02/2022,"We spent a day and a night, calm, perfect for visiting the city and having a restaurant"
5461,1757028,4,Dhabyz,15/02/2022,"in the office of Tourism confirm to me that they are going to close this car park when they open the new areas. But until then I think it's an excellent option. There are 23 free spaces for AC (48 h. maximum), emptying gray, black, water loading all free. Shopping center with supermarket, cafeteria in the same parking lot. At night there are almost no cars, during the day they do. And overlooking the river! Thank you."
5461,1752815,4,EnigUK,11/02/2022,"Great free parking for campervans. Felt very safe, we parked for 24h and left our bikes on the back of the van, no issues. very quiet overnight. short walk to town and river right next to the parking."
5461,1752322,4,marcdop,10/02/2022,They told us at the tourist office that they are building two areas and that this parking lot will no longer be for AC. Water works fine. It is a shared parking with cars. During the day there is quite a lot of traffic.

5461,1733895,3,PinarCaravan,14/01/2022,"01.01.22 Good look for those who take car seats. The rest is a car park with very tourist sizes. For a car you have to take two seats. And quite narrow. Well located. But there are larger car parks than this quite close. And having to pay at work is not worth staying in this ""small"" one. (always thinking big car)."
5461,1733066,4,BabsDjekes,13/01/2022,"it was very pleasant stay, because in a city it usually doesn't feel safe. but due to the presence of the many campers it certainly felt safe."
5461,1731791,5,albymarv,10/01/2022,"We spent two nights (vs) and we quite liked it. Upon arrival there were 3 gaps left but it filled up quickly. It is a quiet place, very close to the parador and a short walk from the center. Correct filling and emptying area. León is a very beautiful city, not very big but with many places to visit. Congratulations to the Leonese for their city and thanks for the AC area."
5461,1725575,5,Valencia1326,04/01/2022,Next to a shopping center and a step away from the center of León. I wish all cities would give us these facilities.
5461,1720628,5,ferisa,31/12/2021,"As always, León deserves a lot of praise for this area, we still need to know the new area. We don't need to say ""if you don't like León, there you have the station."" We celebrate the turn of the year here."
5461,1716013,5,Gwaihir,26/12/2021,"A magnificent place to spend the night and visit León. New area a step away from the center and with a multitude of services nearby. VERY IMPORTANT: When leaving, especially in the direction of Madrid, it is very possible that the navigator will send us along the Paseo de Salamanca, on the opposite side of the river. Better to avoid it, since the walk goes under an arch of the San Marcos bridge, where many A / C do not fit."
5461,1714650,4,vicenteacebal,23/12/2021,"Area fills the Constitution Bridge, we continue a few meters ahead and in a street to the right next to a very large park, with many places we sleep very well."

5461,1701817,5,bruniskaut,02/12/2021,Parking for motorhomes 20 minutes from the center (10 minutes by bike). There is a connecting bike path along the river. Excellent services and cleanliness.

5461,1657419,5,Kerowynn,22/10/2021,"Free if you are in the area provided, which is not so simple since it quickly full. You have to pay for the parking if you have to park in the spaces dedicated to cars. In 2 days, I saw the municipal police pass twice, issuing tickets. Close to the historic center of this beautiful city. Practice with dogs, walk possible just below."
5461,1653172,5,EleyEdu,19/10/2021,"Very central and comfortable to visit León. You have everything close by, the center, the cathedral, etc. There are few places for the AC influx, but you can spend a night in the car area without problems"

The bad thing is that clearly it is small in number of places, the two times we have slept here we parked in the normal area so you have to pay the parking fee, which in Leon is cheap at least."

5461,1613182,3,NachVanLife,27/09/2021,"Although free and not far from the center, it becomes small both in terms of the size of the plaza and the number of users. At the end of September it was full. As the place is shared with cars there is a bit of noise."

I do believe that the places should be reserved for motorhomes, as there were small campers occupying places when those vehicles fit in the places of passenger cars. But indeed, we were able to park in the paid ones, which is cheap, and the conductor told us that nothing would happen if our vehicle occupied two places. Thanks to the city council for taking us into account"

We stayed one night occupying two parking spaces in this area (due to the size of the motorhome) and nothing happened to us.

There is no shade and we did not come across any mosquitoes.

There are full services excluding electricity.
The grey waste is a normal ground drain.
The black WC drain is 600mm off the ground with a cover and it's own push button tap to clean the cassette. The drain is stainless steel and a nice touch but it tends to splash about a bit when emptying the cassette.
The fresh water tap at the opposite side of the black WC drain pillar is a small screw-on. It is a 3/4 turn handle and has great pressure.
There are large bins at the front of the carpark.

There is a medium sized shopping center with Mercadona as the main anchor tenant across the road. The Museum of Contemporary Art is behind the shopping center. There are plenty of nice local cafes in this area which are not touristy prices like the center. 

It's a great location to see León. It's a lovely walk into the city center along the river.

5461,133285,3,franciscolorin,06/05/2017,"For a city like León, very few places and very difficult to empty and fill water"
5461,131998,3,Alucard,30/04/2017,"Asphalted urban area and well leveled, the area is the last row of a car park in front of a shopping center, so there is a lot of movement, although the night is calm. It fills up On the way back is the river, ideal for walking and the center is also reached on a walk. The sewage is poured into a trapdoor in the middle of the street in front of the shopping center, all glamor."
5461,126748,4,haytor,11/04/2017,"Excellent place to get to know and walk around the city, next to a river walk, there is also a road that does not generate much noise at night. The water change thing is bad, but it can be done."
5461,121081,4,PacoFernandez,23/02/2017,"The parking is very good and quiet, in front of the ""Plaza León"" shopping center and the walk along the river, ideal for relaxing your legs. Well located to visit the city center. The black and gray water emptying services could be improved."

5461,117874,4,salolimu,06/01/2017,"It is good because of the proximity to the center, but the area is an improvised parking lot, the water intake is complicated, you cannot rinse the poti and to throw away the liquid it is any drain grate and to empty the poti it is in the middle of the sidewalk in a cover that is barely visible."
5461,116837,2,pacasu,28/12/2016,"Quiet area at night, during the day a lot of movement in the parking lot. Only 10 spaces, you can park in the parking lot, it's time and they come to look at tickets, be careful"

5461,71074,3,xicu43,02/05/2016,"I have been and I say my opinion, as it has been festive I have parked in places of payment because I was all occupied seats but good place for sports or near the center, what I did not like was, to fill a bit complicated water, throw faecal waters must go to the disabled area parking in the waxed a pit, but is that there are people passing by and is a bit shameful."
5461,66437,4,Lucien3000,27/03/2016,"Reasonable distance from the center (20 minutes). in fact, 10 places free for 48 hours for campervans, others paying at a fair price, free on Saturday after 2 p.m. and the whole Sunday it seems to me until Monday 10 a.m. WC drain on the sidewalk for passers-by (can be annoying). fresh water and gray water drain easily accessible. good spot with shopping center 2 steps away."

5461,40166,1,pedrooliveira,28/06/2015,Good park for overnight stay. It is not worth relying on the services as they are not practical.
5461,35745,4,ferdy,08/05/2015,Area very well located but quite complicated downloads. Water load a little better. In the squares that are not reserved you have to pay for the blue zone.
5461,33326,3,alchausfor,10/04/2015,"Parking right in front of a shopping center with a supermarket. Access to the water is complicated, emptying the toilet is in the middle of the street so it is annoying and you have to use force to lift the lid. Emptying gray water in the middle of the parking lot. Just at the edge of a hypermarket, the access to the water and the life of the toilet is complicated, it is in the middle of the street."

5474,3287735,5,Irsis,12/09/2023,"Great campsite, sanitary facilities are cleaned regularly, showers are very large, unfortunately no individual washing cubicles, very nice staff, to get to the clean beach you have to cross the street and through a building, loungers and umbrellas are free, there is a bus stop in front of the campsite - you can take the bus drive to Barcelona. We would definitely come back here. Clear recommendation"

5474,3233737,5,FilmovanidronemCZ,29/08/2023,"Really very nice camp. We were going to Malgrat, but it was crowded everywhere, so we finally found this place on the way. The price is higher, but they really have everything here. The beach is clean, sunbeds and umbrellas included. In the campsite shop, restaurant, ice cream, 1 swimming pool, 1 relaxation pool (cold spring), children's wading pool. Sports area - tennis, football, trampolines. Every evening animation programme for children. Large open theatre. All these activities in the slope above the level of the camping, so even if the pool children are fighting or there is a show, so the caravan is relatively quiet and peaceful. Toilets clean, well maintained. Right in front of the campsite a bus stop to Barcelona, or about 10 min. walk to the train station. We wanted to stay here for 3 days, but in the end we extended the stay to double. With a 9m motorhome the staff at the reception had a problem at first, but the owner allowed the entry and we were fine. Recommended."

Had to leave at 3am, the gate was specially opened for us. Had fish one evening, which was great and the other noodles, which completely lacked taste. Would come again and can only recommend it"
5474,3010508,4,FraToGib,23/07/2023,"This place is very well managed and organised. The staff is very helpful, facilities are very clean and the restaurant is acceptable for an easy dinner. However, the Camping site is directly besides the coastal route and the trainway. Thus, it is very noisy 24/7. You feel like living next to Placa de Catalunya in terms of noise. Train Connection to Barcelona is perfect, so the Place is a good hub."

An important drawback, the lamentable state of the garbage cans, which even when empty were infested with flies and mosquitoes and had a nauseating smell. A focus of infection for all beach users. The city council should disinfect it."

Nothing that can't be endured"

Apart from that, the place is a bit depressing, with the beginnings of abandoned construction, seems to have been interrupted. And a lot of waste! Take away your waste, and bury your excrement! I'm a little ashamed to be likened sometimes to those campers who leave all their rubbish around them."

The place is indeed very beautiful and very quiet because the road just next to it only leads to the lighthouse. It is therefore used a little in the evening but nothing at night. This car park seemed much better to me than the one just across the lagoon to the north towards Almeria.

5524,2593718,4,WLMHoogendoorn,28/02/2023,"In the evening you can enjoy a beautiful sunset and a peaceful night's sleep. There were about 20 campers, some on the raised part between the posts. The police drove past, but no problem. We ourselves stood on the unpaved part, where we also stood neatly level with the help of some stones."
5524,2592536,5,Morcis,27/02/2023,"We spent one night here and it was a great place. Very wide paved area where about 20 AC will enter. Not a sound is heard, more than the waves of the sea. For February there are quite a few vans, perhaps in summer it is difficult to find a space."
5524,2591924,5,travelinthru,26/02/2023,"A very nice place by the sea, easy access even for large mobiles, what more could you ask for?"
5524,2580819,4,Mastercamper23,17/02/2023,"Flat parking, facing the sea, without services. There are usually plenty of AC and campers. We spent two very quiet nights. The only drawback is that if there is wind you are very exposed."
5524,2574834,4,jucla45,11/02/2023,"3 nights here, very quiet. village at the end of the world. no service, easy access including for large CC. nice walk on the beach or in the salt flats. access to the lighthouse."
5524,2573837,4,EGPH,10/02/2023,"Really very very quiet place, but too many disrespectful campers… there is a colony of cats, if you have food with you please feed them like we did too! They have no one to take care of them…"
5524,2567966,2,DecretamosFeria,04/02/2023,"Parking next to the beach, without services. There is a colony of cats. The special sunset and quiet night. Full of motorhomes and campers and unfortunately some do not respect others. Disgusting."
5524,2566934,3,WilbyUK,03/02/2023,Car park with no services. Lovely beach and crystal clear water. There are some hills behind park up but no obvious trails to hike. Ok place for a night but probably wouldn’t come here again.
5524,2564706,5,CabriVan,31/01/2023,Calm night with a stunning sunset just ahead over a red sea.
5524,2560550,5,AlexandraePippo,25/01/2023,"excellent parking near the beach and the road, there are many campers and vans in this area, breathtaking sunsets"
5524,2556373,5,nurihostench,20/01/2023,"Very quiet place in front of the sea. There is garbage, it has no services but there is a center very close to the town. very close to the cabo de gata lighthouse and you can walk until you reach the church. there were 13 campers and it was January 20, I don't know how it will be in summer"
5524,2555755,5,VanAlia,19/01/2023,We spent one night in mid-November. There were quite a few motorhomes to be low season. Very quiet place and a few meters from the beach. Precious sunrise. In the village the 2 bars were both closed. 5 minutes by car from the Cabo de Gata lighthouse. Place to keep in mind
5524,2555535,5,sabbaticalcamper,19/01/2023,"Stayed for one night and slept well, place kept clean by the campervans that are using it and the sea just across the road. No traffic at night."
5524,2546799,4,Tobiga,08/01/2023,"Standing further ahead right on the street for 1 night, the police came by but said nothing. You can see the sunset from there."
5524,2538579,4,adventuresinacamper,02/01/2023,"arrived late at night after moving on from a nearby parkup. places were flat, bins available. really quiet sleep. bins were emptied at 6am on the dot, but only took a minute or so. beach across the road but didn't have time to visit. as others have said, lots of cats in the area but we were not bothered by them and didn't see them in the morning at all."
5524,2537051,4,lacabanyeta,01/01/2023,Fantastic parking in front of the beach !! We have spent a perfect New Year's Eve with sea views! There are no services but we will return for sure !!
5524,2533870,4,AlfredoSanchez,30/12/2022,"We spent the night on 12/26 and everything was very quiet. There were a good number of motorhomes. It is an excellent point to watch the sunset. It has basic services; rubbish bin, pet friendly and a couple of bars nearby. Good mobile coverage. From this point, at night, the sky looks great."
5524,2531789,4,eduelas,29/12/2022,"many cars, but a good place to spend the night."
5524,2530825,5,AngelaCarlos,28/12/2022,It has been very nice to arrive at night and see that at dawn you are right in front of the beach. Big car park. We have been in the gravel area and it was level. Very quiet with no large passage of cars or people. Nice and quiet place.
5524,2529941,4,Furgo_time,27/12/2022,"We slept one night out of season. Don't worry, the police didn't tell us anything. Nothing should be removed."
5524,2524314,5,JulianCamble,19/12/2022,"Really super spot to park off-season. Just about at the end of the road, so minimal passing traffic. Few people except other respectful van folk. Spectacular sunset! Great swimming and hiking on your doorstep. No services at all. Cute nearby restaurant you have to pre-order the day before."
5524,2520198,5,CindyetVivian,12/12/2022,"Perfect for spending a night, very quiet and little traffic. A magnificent sunset over the sea that amazed us! Too bad the shops around are closed, surely very nice in the middle of summer"
5524,2519270,4,irynatovych,11/12/2022,"Good place to spend the night in front of the beach. Quite quiet, although being close to the road, cars pass by. The sunset was very beautiful"
5524,2518743,2,isabel1947campe,10/12/2022,Parking in front of the beach next to other motorhomes. It has no services.
5524,2514997,4,OlgaCamargo,07/12/2022,Visited in winter. We traveled with a Camper Van. We have spent the night. Super quiet. There were other motorhomes and we have not had any problems.
5524,2513966,4,bry1940,05/12/2022,"A quiet place, right in front of the beach. At the foot of the Cabo de Gata mountain range, through which you can go hiking. In the area there are many cats, be careful that in a mistake they try to enter the vehicle and be careful when starting."
5524,2506342,4,ellahoz,26/11/2022,Good place to watch the sun go down and spend the night. At no time did we feel danger. Several hiking trails can be done from there.
5524,2502316,4,mortyetboulette,21/11/2022,we had a quiet night. just the sound of the garbage truck at 6am.
5524,2495694,1,pepepepone,14/11/2022,"I spent a few hours here, for lunch, I thought I would spend the night, but seeing the comments, that the tires are punctured, here and in the other at the entrance, I decided to spend the night in Almería, a pity that these things happen."
5524,2462582,3,Paula1Paul2,26/10/2022,"We actually wanted to stay the night there, but after talking to a French guy who told us that 6 vehicles had their tires punctured the night before, we drove on. Otherwise nice beach."
5524,2457221,2,fmartinezm3,22/10/2022,"It is not surprising that more and more people prohibit us from staying in more places. This area is idyllic, perfect, fantastic. But this time it was occupied by motorhomes, I'd better rectify, people who have motorhomes, 5 or 6, who organized a party. Music, screams, lights... I had never seen it before. They confuse the private with the public. The site is fantastic. Let's see how long it lasts for us."
5524,2451770,4,alysmpearce,19/10/2022,spent night here reluctantly after getting moved on by police from other spot. but we preferred it here! you can take a walk on the beach to watch the moon easily as its right there. we also felt safe with so many campers around us!
5524,2450438,5,Tatuzza,18/10/2022,Very nice and quiet place. We stopped for a passing night and had a good time.
5524,2448347,4,chiaracibe,17/10/2022,"Quiet place without services, parking in front of the sea, which is certainly priceless as an awakening. We had one night and then we set out on the seafront to sunbathe and have lunch. It is very popular with other campers, if you do not find a place there are two others along the same road, also valid with the same characteristics."
5524,2444815,3,JoostAnki,15/10/2022,The comments below give a representative picture.
5524,2435398,3,dasafru,10/10/2022,perfect for beach bathing and snorkeling
5524,2419803,4,james1508,03/10/2022,"4 stars because it’s by a beach in a national park and it was busy but a peaceful night in October . Only bins available, couldn’t find a beach shower. All good for a stop over ."
5524,2414258,5,sobaito,30/09/2022,"Very quiet place out of season! On the beach, without services. A perfect night although it was very windy, before starting the march I had to clean sand and get out of all the crystals!"
5524,2384856,4,zoerik,19/09/2022,"it's not a dream of space, but nice and quiet and right on the water. the places higher up are nicer, but you can't wild camp on them, so the place is a safe alternative. the street next to it can hardly be heard and the lights are not turned on. no mosquitoes, but many flies."
5524,2378797,3,guembe,17/09/2022,A bit dirty around. We stayed in mid-September. The beach is across the road.
5524,2366021,5,andreaines19,12/09/2022,Good place to sleep. More motorhomes and vans camp. There are no services but it is nice and quiet
5524,2339215,4,adrialex,04/09/2022,"Right in front of the beach!! Without any services but respecting the place and the others, it is a good place to spend a couple of days, that is, if we respect the environment, which is fantastic!"
5524,2322345,1,labuenavida,30/08/2022,Today August 30 until tomorrow at 9:30 p.m. cut off by cycling lap they do not allow parking
5524,2263746,5,itzicl,18/08/2022,"We have slept there without any problem, the only thing is the parking lot is a little inclined and crowded with motorhomes that get together and make a racket. no showers nearby"
5524,2248176,4,arkimac,16/08/2022,"Public parking, the only place where you can spend the night in the entire area. Outside this parking lot, the police passed warning. It is usually full in high season, but waiting in the afternoon you can find a place with people leaving the beach. There are people with caravans that seem to live there. There is a kiosk and bar right next door"
5524,1999196,5,TXEMASTAR,21/06/2022,"Great we have spent 2 nights, June 18 and 19 and perfect. Great place to watch sunsets on the beach. Be respectful and be parked not camped. People came upstairs and at some point it looked like a campsite... Please PARK and don't camp. Let's take care of the sites so they don't get banned. Thank you La Fabriquilla for betting on our tourism."
5524,1980821,5,BARRANCO,15/06/2022,"Very nice beach with crystal clear waters very friendly kiosk and restaurants in the area, be careful that if the place is saturated the vans with canoes for tourists who arrive in the morning can bother them... police do not usually fine, but the motorhome next door tells me that one day they were fined for open windows and chocks, uncivil campers relieve themselves outside and we'll all pay."
5524,1960350,5,armintanzanian,09/06/2022,"We spent one night on 04/20. highly recommended site, a few meters from the beach, paved and level parking. I would repeat without a doubt"
5524,1957531,4,gimenells,07/06/2022,"Asphalt area with dirt parking next door. We spent the night without problems. Caravans and campers. From the town, it is the best option since it is very small. Of course, it stays in the dark after 10 p.m. approx."
5524,1940561,5,Karine2020,02/06/2022,"An amazing website! To sleep, the parking lot for motorhomes seems not bad but I was able to park in the village just before the beach of La Fabriquilla. With a van and without unpacking anything, the night was perfect."
5524,1931343,4,rdamien,30/05/2022,a priori one of the only legal spots to sleep at night in the area. suddenly a lot of motorhomes and vans but you just have to take a little altitude as soon as you wake up to find a nice view and a little peace!
5524,1920895,5,lorabad,27/05/2022,"beautiful site. It has a shower on the beach a few meters walk away. During the day there is a lot of movement of people because there are kayak companies next to it, but at night it is very quiet and without noise."
5524,1893402,5,liandou,16/05/2022,"Totally recommended. At this time of year still very free. We spent two very quiet nights. Also accompanied by other motorhomes. In summer I suppose it will be more crowded, as is normal."
5524,1885495,4,giachard,12/05/2022,"Visited the place and  saw the pannel at the entrance of the Natural Park area...so i inquired the local police who replied that they were aware of the abuses during the night time, a fine is foreseen... i decided to stay on the beach and park away"
5524,1832199,4,gspera,17/04/2022,"Good view next to the beach, no police control, good for one night."
5524,1823392,4,GemmaCasanova,15/04/2022,"Wide and flat site in front of the sea. No services, camping prohibited, only overnight is allowed. One of the only places in the area where you can legally spend the night in front of the sea."
5524,1823151,4,jordiadrian,15/04/2022,"good place to spend the night. Many cars and campers, good atmosphere. beach right in front."
5524,1804897,4,Klunkertusse,03/04/2022,"Great environment, great beach. Pretty windy, unfortunately right on the road. But it was tolerable."
5524,1792315,5,WanderWebb,23/03/2022,Great little stop over with lovely views and just a stone’s throw from the beach. Very quiet. Quite exposed in windy weather.
5524,1791617,3,Fabiano23,22/03/2022,We made a small stop to visit the lagoons (Salinas del cabo de gata) and the nearby tower (de San Miguel) parking by the sea there were many campers and vans. There is only a small functioning water fountain and some recommended baskets there is a beautiful view.
5524,1790239,2,Ariche76,21/03/2022,"As of Easter, it is highly inadvisable due to the crowding of vans, motorhomes and even caravans. please take care of the few places we have left in the park, in the end we are going to agree with the 4 politicians on duty who want to isolate us in paid zones given to their party colleagues."
5524,1787214,5,love.in.a.van,18/03/2022,"Visit March 18, 2 nights. Paved parking with another piece of land. Area with more motorhomes and Campers. We are many but there is calm and silence. You sleep in front of the beach and the noise of the sea is slightly heard. There are no services but it is one of the few places where you can sleep legally."
5524,1786282,5,barou,17/03/2022,Although it is a very nice parking spot facing the sea. Very quiet even if there are many of us tonight. Nice walk to the lighthouse in a volcanic setting. No service just trash cans so let's respect this place.
5524,1786139,5,CagouilleExpress,17/03/2022,"Parking right in front of the sea. Even in this season it was full for the night. There is a small bar next door, the staff is very nice. 40 minutes walk from the lighthouse."
5524,1777818,5,bizkis,08/03/2022,"Very nice parking area. We were lucky to find good spot with sea view, without any camper blocking it (place is popular). Sea at night was quite noisy, but overall very good stay."
5524,1772818,4,welly2k,04/03/2022,Great spot facing the sea. We did park as many others on the raised part with no problem. (Perhaps in busy times you shouldn’t?) Stunning views (we were lucky to get front spot). Fantastic hike to Lighthouse ….
5524,1766297,5,europa-kontour.ch,26/02/2022,"Great, calm. The (komoot) hike around the lagoon was a bit too long/repetitive. However, it is suitable as a bike tour."
5524,1756408,4,patlori,15/02/2022,Nice walk to Cabo de Gata. Fewer motorhomes on this car park than the one near the village. Nice view of the sea. Quiet
5524,1746739,4,irenevivancosn,03/02/2022,"Very good place to sleep, first line of the beach and very quiet. Many campers, but it is quite large."
5524,1744662,4,Mariolan,31/01/2022,"Large and level esplanade, secluded, perfect for spending the night, without noise, from where to watch the sunset, without services. thank you for this place on the edge of the natural park, let's respect it"
5524,1743265,5,EnriqueBC,29/01/2022,"Parking without services, lots of AC but quiet, on the edge of the beach and next to a small town with a tavern."
5524,1738182,4,filegar72,21/01/2022,"Perfect place. Month of January 2022. Full of AC, many foreigners. Little noise. Paved and flat."
5524,1733496,4,OleSelnes,13/01/2022,"A good place to stay. But ... people, don't forget that there are people living in the small town who certainly don't like having several of your huge carriages standing in front of their houses. Not a ghost town. At some point there will be a barrier here at a height of 2.10 m. Stay in the parking lot! And don't piss on the beach, damn it! Behave decently!"
5524,1726586,5,PaskusVan,05/01/2022,We had a perfect night. Accompanied by many AC
5524,1717353,5,PantherVanJS,28/12/2021,"Very good option to spend the night out of season, in summer I don't know how it is. It is 10 minutes from the lighthouse. Very quiet and in front of the sea."
5524,1715811,5,RatayTeam,26/12/2021,"Nice place for a few nights. Beautiful sunsets, good for dogs, not overly crowd (not enough space), flat, and good 3g/4g."
5524,1713770,5,teo2609,21/12/2021,Nice place for s few nights. The Beach and the sunset are beautiful. Recommended.
5524,1703950,5,froschfresse,05/12/2021,spent a peaceful night with many other campers ☺️
5524,1700886,4,ginavalli,30/11/2021,"Parking pitch, less than 100m from the sea you can hear the waves at night. Quiet, and completely dark. There are waste bins."
5524,1696225,5,Kermitdreambi,23/11/2021,"Great place with a mega view of the sea- dreamy sunsets! Fair and disposal at the BP petrol station roundabout north of the square. Nice excursions possible by bike to San José or a hike to the salt pans, during which overnight stays are possible without any problems depending on the season."
5524,1695649,5,hedwigr,22/11/2021,We slept well here. About 5 campers present. Place enough. Leveling not necessary. Restaurant was only open on Sunday afternoon
5524,1694691,5,hedwigr,21/11/2021,Arrived Sunday at 1 pm. Only 6 motorhomes. Nice place to stand.
5524,1673842,5,poyatox,01/11/2021,We have spent a lot of time with 20 motorhomes. very quiet at night.
5524,1659148,1,odysea1996,24/10/2021,Too many people ! Ugly.
5524,1655304,5,amapara,21/10/2021,"Perfect site. We spent the night together with 15-20 more campers. Great to wake up to sea views. A neighbor told us that the police usually fine those who park in the area that is paved and has a curb that defines it. It appears to be a former privately owned soccer field. In the land area, however, parking is allowed."
5524,1643915,1,Cau_Rodamons,14/10/2021,"A good place to park but where you can be fined for being a natural park, apparently not always, but on 10/13/21 the kayaks and the civil guard arrived shortly after. Better to avoid the area until the infrastructure improves."
5524,1642210,1,soletevit,13/10/2021,"Beautiful place to which we have come several times, but in which today we have been fined. Several days have passed local police and civil guard, until today without problem. They have fined several of us (we were in the area where the kayaks stop). Argument: it is a natural park (the sign is 100 m away). They comment that there is an area in Retamar, that curiously they have the kayaks parked, will there be any relationship?"
5524,1637347,4,masfworld,10/10/2021,We went in October 2021. Very good place to spend the night. You have containers close by. Try to park away from these otherwise it will smell. Quiet to spend the night. Great views
5524,1629952,5,Harry11780,06/10/2021,"Spectacular location on the beach, parking and overnight (no camping) is allowed. Asphalt floor."
5524,1629052,3,KeithWeston,06/10/2021,"We parked here for a night, a few other motorhomes also present. Nice view of the beach, pretty quiet being October."
5524,1598382,5,lilipu324,21/09/2021,"Sleeping with the sound of the sea is the best. Very little frequented road, the police passed by and said nothing, they allow the night. You have to get a seat early, it is very crowded."
5524,1543325,1,MisterRodman,03/09/2021,"A nasty, bluntly, you are dirty will end up banning any Camper area! garbage, horrible smell and people like you are in a camp."
5524,1535914,1,RobertoPE,31/08/2021,"The place could be fine if people behaved, but it is the closest thing to a shanty town. Dirt, urine smell everywhere, indiscriminately casting gray. We didn't even stay overnight, we went to a Camper Park at least to sleep peacefully and not in a garbage dump. Keep it up it will last two days."
5524,1525124,4,LMCdaSilva,28/08/2021,"The 4 stars are for the local population, for receiving us without conditions, in an area where there are no free parks and it is forbidden to stay overnight outside urban areas. We must all contribute to leaving the place better than we found it. The behavior of some can make the place become prohibited."
5524,1521611,3,monfermat,28/08/2021,A bit crowded but to spend a night in front of the beach fine.
5524,1514305,2,Rull83,26/08/2021,Wide and quiet place to sleep. The downside is that most of the parking lot is sloped and there are a lot of smells on the side that faces the town.
5524,1513296,2,kangooping,25/08/2021,"Ample but mostly sloping parking. There was a lot of garbage in the surroundings and it smelled pretty bad. Despite everything, it is quiet and you can sleep without fear of being fined. Take care of what little we have or we will run out of it."
5524,1510412,3,jaivam22,25/08/2021,"Place to spend the night without problem, many Campers and motorhomes. At night, cars and trucks are heard. Good place to spend a night."
5524,1509733,4,GodinoCamper,25/08/2021,Shelter for camper at nightfall. They allow you to spend the night there. there are always people. That is if the rock is sneaking in with confidence. EITHER WE WILL BE AWARE OF TAKING OUT THINGS AND MESSING ... OR SOON WE WILL BE KICKED OUT OF THERE. Otherwise perfect place to spend the day and enjoy the beach.
5524,1490084,1,t59,21/08/2021,"We are turning it into a shanty town of caravans, campers, vans and motorhomes! do not be dirty! the gray waters are emptied in the authorized sites, the garbage is thrown in the containers and everyone's rest is respected !!! CIVISM!"
5524,1484234,3,lauranceverner62,19/08/2021,"Ample parking full of motorhomes in August. the atmosphere is good, but there are noises and people staying up late at night. however in the area there is nothing better."
5524,1471845,1,GiottiAlmeria,17/08/2021,"I am a user of this area mainly in winter, it seems that some forget what it is: a parking lot near houses, and in a Natural Park. Behaviors such as camping, taking out awnings and chairs, draining water, making barbecue, putting on loud music, are behaviors that will eventually lead to us being forbidden to spend the night, and even parking here, sooner rather than later. Please, a little respect."
5524,1467483,3,marumbo,16/08/2021,"Close to the beach, just one road through. With containers. Parking with more caravans, AC and campers. Safe and quiet place."
5524,1464937,5,juanfrantejero,16/08/2021,Very good place if you want tranquility to sleep. I recommend going when families are leaving the beach to find a place. I would repeat again
5524,1452355,5,veggielore,13/08/2021,"Very good site, to repeat."

5524,1233726,3,naish666,03/06/2021,"We spent one I have not from May 39 to May 31, 2021. Parking right on the beach very quiet. The night we stayed there were a lot of mosquitoes and insects that got into the AC despite the mosquito nets, so we had to close doors and windows.

5524,1214388,3,tamihami,23/05/2021,"Extremely busy, chaotic on weekends. People made a lot of noise until late at night. It is that it is the only place in the area where you can spend the night. A beautiful sunset. Garbage cans available. Showers are available on the beach nearby, very nice!"

5524,1137933,3,CasitaNL,16/02/2021,Good quiet place to spend the night. Not really special as it is a gravel/asphalt place between two roads. Good for a walk along the beach. Just a friendly special request to camper owners with dogs: please clean up your dog's feces. That too is ‘keep the spot clean’. We do the same :)

5524,1033458,2,solrrak,07/09/2020,"The site is spectacular but we don't think it's just a parking lot. I don't think they will delay in prohibiting us from parking, I've seen everything, awnings, tables, chairs, stoves ... so we can't claim our rights !!"
5524,1029024,2,Ro.androll,06/09/2020,"You can spend the night but without opening windows or taking out tables or chairs, something that no one respects, it seems like a city without law, cars park where they get caught and if they cut you off you get annoyed. If you want to rest better find another place. There is also no loading or unloading of water."
5524,1017100,5,pedromartinezlopez,31/08/2020,"Perfect place, quiet and with space to spend the day on the beach of La Fabriquilla, which is wonderful, without paying, not like in other well-known and crowded beaches, I will not stay to sleep because I have to fill and empty the waters, but I think it's allowed, I'll be back for sure."

5524,768234,5,MIB100,13/01/2020,"Great place for 1-2 nights. Perfect for sunsets. Unfortunately, the enjoyment is diminished by evening noise from contemporaries with generators. Completely incomprehensible in the age of solar cells and extremely ignorant towards the other co-workers. However, the place can not help, so continue 5 points."

But ""some"" take out awnings, tables, chairs etc and do not let rest, others dogs barking and others shitting in the ditch of the highway. We will complain when they remove it, but how unpresentable. They also arrive and park occupying 2 places. In short, try to comply with the rules and take care of the area, not dirty, do not disturb ..."

5524,274464,3,martincr,24/06/2018,It has no service. Family beach ideal for water sports such as snorkeling or kayaking. It would be a pity that due to the incivility of a few we were left without the possibility of staying overnight here.
5524,260619,3,Wiese21,29/05/2018,Simple parking space at the beginning of the village. Beach only 20 meters away. Very quiet in the week only some noise from the street.

5524,227496,2,pilartruco,13/03/2018,We discard it because there are better places around the coast. It is surrounded by 2 roads and it is a campaign in lands without more attraction than being in front of the sea.

There is absolutely no problem to continue the road to the lighthouse, it is a 2-lane road in perfect condition and a perfectly normal width, a 10% coast is frankly nothing exceptional, nor in Spain where the coasts sometimes reach more than 20% or elsewhere."
5524,100927,3,jesusrp,28/08/2016,"In summer, there is a high probability of being locked up in the sunny hours by the cars that park to go to the beach. As of 7.30 the companies of kayaks begin to arrive and to download and they make enough noise. At night they cut the streetlamp lighting at 0.00. (In summer season there are high probabilities to get blocked by cars during the day.)"

When you turn away from the general go straight up towards the castle, don't take the first cobbled street on the right between the houses, it's too narrow and my 2.25m wide van won't fit.

Second smaller area right next to the castle as per the second photo - more suited to camping cars and small motorhomes. Both are accessed via the same road. We parked by the castle.

In the village there is a supermarket, fish hall, a great bakery and launderette. Everything can be reached in a few minutes. 2€ can be booked additionally for water supply. All that's missing is electricity."
5671,3247745,4,Flokaka,01/09/2023,"Very well located area with designated spaces on the ground, access to the city center and the beach on foot. The area was free when we went. Access to water costs €2, it takes around €6 to fill up. Small café nearby ideal for breakfast, it opens at 10:30 a.m."

It's still free. The beach is right next door and the town with the colorful houses is a 5-minute walk away. It has a place to do the services and it goes with a payment machine. Although I don't know the price since we didn't have to use it.
5671,3223392,5,nathalia22,27/08/2023,"The region is very beautiful! It's worth visiting. We went for the first time in July and the area was free. We returned on 08/20/23 and there was a water control system. They will probably start charging for services. We couldn't find the place to pay, so we went to another P 7km away. Anyway, it's a really beautiful place."
5671,3215173,4,Isidris,25/08/2023,"Good place to spend the night surrounded by more caravans, although it is quite noisy. It is a safe area, next to the beach. At the moment it is free. Right next to it there is another parking area, outside this enclosure, which overlooks the beach dunes. There is a beach bar next door with toilets (for customers only) and outdoor showers."
5671,3208279,4,LeireEtxaburu,24/08/2023,"The soccer field next door, a great place to spend a few days and get to know the surroundings. At the moment it is free. I take away a star because there are no services available, damaged or out of service!"

The beach bar next door is not very nice, the owner. But a spectacular place behind the dunes and we stayed for 3 days. They are preparing the place to make it paid and closed, which I think is great, if the AC places increase"

5671,3176971,5,mariafcordero,18/08/2023,"Very good site! We were very lucky to park in the parking lot itself, but we saw that there are other areas next to it where people park. The same day we left they were setting up an old soccer field to park the campers for €3 and thus leave the parking lot for people in the area. The place is very good with access to the beach, with a bar with bathrooms and showers."
5671,3167899,5,kkaos,17/08/2023,"Good site. It depends on the time you arrive, it is occupied by cars that go to the beach, but around 7:00 p.m. it begins to empty and more free spaces remain. It is a privileged site, although there is already a barrier and a machine that are not yet in operation. There are outdoor showers next door and the bar staff allow you to shower there."
5671,3161277,2,andretortt,16/08/2023,"The area is just a parking lot on gravel, quite dusty. The locals park the cars right in between the campers. Avoid weekends and main holidays, the locals use the area to grill fish right next to you. We had to move because of the smoke of the BBQs."
5671,3159113,4,camperinerba,16/08/2023,Great quiet place for one night with boardwalk to a beautiful beach. Currently there is no water (only that of the external showers) because they are doing the work and they will put the services on payment during the week.

The area is usually full, but around the area there are several areas where you can park. for me the dead-end street in front of the area is better than the area. There are cycle paths to take different routes along the coast and wooden walkways to walk along the beaches. It seems that soon it will be paid by installing barrier and cameras."
5671,3128343,1,missa33,12/08/2023,Attention no water on 12/08. The service will become chargeable. The municipality has installed a barrier and a digicode to use the water.

A special mention to the Spanish motorhome, which despite the services preferred to empty part of its waste water in front of my door to launch a drop by drop...."
5671,3099687,3,blasvan,08/08/2023,"Overcrowding is the definition today. The toilets are for the exclusive use of the clients of the beach bar, the entrance to empty is very complicated for a large vehicle, few spaces, which means that the beach parking lot is also full of all kinds of vehicles in which people spend the night without consideration. My assessment I suppose that in low season it would be better."

5671,3056438,5,Rafikis,01/08/2023,"Not much to add to what has already been said: the area is well set up, comfortable and has spectacular rear views of the dune. It remains small but there is a lot of movement… Costa Nova is nice for a paradinha"
5671,3050932,5,ikaner,31/07/2023,"Great, a very quiet night, walking from cafes, typical Aveiro houses and the beautiful beach. Highly recommended!"
5671,3048882,5,EquipED,30/07/2023,Very top place !!!
5671,3048749,5,ruthmendez,30/07/2023,very good. next to the beach and a beach bar of 10!
5671,3044911,5,NaiJes,30/07/2023,"Wonderful place to spend the night. Everything nearby, restaurants, beach, the estuary area... there is a beach bar in the parking lot with everything you need. We will definitely be back"
5671,3039503,5,giulytoby,29/07/2023,comfortable and quiet parking to spend the night. 1 min from the beach. There are bars and restaurants within walking distance
5671,3036290,5,UArretxe,28/07/2023,"We spent a very good night. The parking lot was full of motorhomes and vans. They recommend going early to find a place, although we arrived at 8:30 p.m. and we were able to park, because there was a free space. If this car park is full nearby there is another one (which could be seen from this one) where more motorhomes could be seen."
5671,3034797,5,groovers,28/07/2023,"Really great place to stay. Folks at the bar are super friendly and helpful. Allow you to use the toilets if you purchase a little something, which i think is fair. Even though there were a lot of people parked it was super quiet and a lovely family feel. The beach is very close and absolutely stunning. Stayed two nights and would recommend."
5671,3028438,5,nitxu,27/07/2023,"Quiet place and a few meters from the beach, cold water shower available and toilets if you consume at the bar. It fills up with motorhomes and vans at sunset, I would say that it is better to be there no later than 7pm if you want to find a place."
5671,3012488,5,naiaralopetegi,24/07/2023,Nice place Attached to the beach and with showers. The town is very close. Almost everything is full after dark. To repeat!
5671,2997693,4,jotabelatz,21/07/2023,"Excellent access to the beach. Good places, although complicated parking for motorhomes >6m. The discharge of water was complicated by local vehicles parked at the access. Beach showers, but WC only for bar customers. Bar with excessive noise, annoying, and with karaoke"
5671,2992332,5,frutuosocm,20/07/2023,"We just spent the night and it was very peaceful. Site with evictions, but we do not use it. We advise those who want to guarantee a place to arrive in the morning, because at night when we arrived there were almost no places available."
5671,2977251,5,djdynamik,17/07/2023,this day there is room in a superb place!!
5671,2977058,5,Jmpo53,17/07/2023,"I begin by offering sincere CONGRATULATIONS to the municipality. This place has the minimum support that the Caravanist needs. I just want them to do the rest, just like in the car parks next door. It is necessary to lay a groundless floor, increase the length of the parking lot (the ACs are getting bigger and bigger) as there is a lot of space and limit parking to 72 hours..."
5671,2965130,5,myfriendstan1,14/07/2023,Great location for an overnight in a cracking part of the country.
5671,2959770,5,grapillard,13/07/2023,"Great location with direct beach access. Small bar, amenities on site, quiet night. Really without hesitation."
5671,2959298,5,peggyplompen,13/07/2023,Super place! Right on the beach. With amenities. And a bar at the camper place.
5671,2959148,5,Quicolas,13/07/2023,A classic now x end with services even if you have to do a Tetris-type maneuver
5671,2954974,4,mattsson81,12/07/2023,"Crowded between the cars but close to the beach and the high waves. But a very cool place to stand and sleep. Now during high season it can probably be difficult to find a place here if you are not out in good time between 09.00-12.00, there was a lot of space this afternoon, it's probably just pure luck if you get a place"
5671,2951844,1,tiritos,11/07/2023,The place is close to the beach but very crowded. Motorhomes parked diagonally occupying two sites. your space is invaded by the vehicle next door. There are much better places
5671,2946837,4,VANNY114,10/07/2023,"The place is fantastic, free and with services. Let's take care of it, it's for spending the night, not for camping and getting everything out of it. There are other locations for that. Good, very good for the municipality."
5671,2937445,5,RVs,08/07/2023,Fabulous next to the beach and beach bar with emptying/filling. Garbage cans for recycling. Highly recommended.
5671,2936934,5,charini72,08/07/2023,I have fallen in love. Next to the beach and a pleasant walk from the promenade. Spectacular site. Awesome sunset. And very good and accessible services. Everything super clean. with a lot of charm
5671,2936897,3,CGF,08/07/2023,"services well, the area more than an area is a settlement of campers. It looks like they spend the whole summer. there is hardly any space between motorhomes, they are practically overcrowded."
5671,2931052,5,patriciaferrario,06/07/2023,"Excellent place .. clean, water loading service, gray and black water discharge .. next to the spectacular beach, green and very quiet surroundings, I recommend it .. thank you for this beautiful place!"
5671,2928222,4,RufioF1,06/07/2023,"Quite full, it is the parking lot of the beach, be careful with the sand, with services, and close to the famous colored houses, I thought it was bigger because of the photographs. The beautiful sunset that can be seen from there makes up for it."
5671,2928153,4,NN97,05/07/2023,"READ THIS BEFORE PARKING

The parking spot is located to one of the most beautiful beaches and grassy lands where you can set up a table and chairs. Pretty close together with other campers. The toilets and the showers belong to the bar so there are NO public indoor restrooms that you can use at any hour. You can use the bar toilet but there is a sign only for customers. 
The beach is amazing."
5671,2927351,4,azertye75,05/07/2023,"At the entrance to the beach and close to restaurants, it's a good place to rest for the night. For us too many people and the nuisances that go with it, however it is free clean and well placed with useful amenities for cc."
5671,2926854,5,Bertafor2,05/07/2023,"The pitch is very close to the beach, V/E great, surroundings with cute houses. Good Italian within walking distance (Mimo Il gusto italiano), but also many other restaurants in the direction of the lagoon. Fresh fruit and fresh fish at Mercado da Costa Nova. We liked it here better than further towards the lighthouse. But much better for swimming at the lighthouse, but also a lot more people."
5671,2922201,5,ottosreisen,04/07/2023,Very full but still very good as a pitch in Portugal
5671,2921490,5,aj79,04/07/2023,"great area in the immediate vicinity of the beach and the shops, market very pretty town with its colorful houses indeed there are delimited pitches but no problem to put a table behind the motorhome (vast grassy ground at the back) very pleasant track cycle path to go to barra and vagueira (entirely flat) I recommend"
5671,2905029,5,GHC44,29/06/2023,"I've been coming here for many years and it's a lovely place. Before I had services I used to go to the area that is in the Vagos water park or the Costa Nova campsite, but now with the area working it's perfect. The only drawback is that to enter a car of more than seven meters is a bit complicated and you have to do a lot of maneuvers and that no car parks right in front of it as happened to me the other day. Anyway the owner came right away. I would fix it by cutting the entrance front about 50 centimeters. In any case, many thanks to the Community for thinking of our collective"
5671,2903796,4,ScottyJoeC,29/06/2023,Great free camp on the beach.  The kids loved getting smashed by the waves.  Only 4 stars because you are so close together there is no room for table and chairs.
5671,2903098,5,Lorenayedu,29/06/2023,"Brutal place, with all kinds of services, new and a spectacular beach with its very close and super cute little town! It has enchanted me! Very very calm and comfortable!"
5671,2902370,5,Robi91,28/06/2023,"Really nice free parking space right on the dunes. Thank you to the community! Unfortunately, there are also campers here who simply drain their gray water, although there is a new disposal station. Please be considerate!"
5671,2896278,5,NARUBYlife,26/06/2023,"Unreal place. Excellent. It used to be like this in the Algarve and we thought we couldn't do it in Portugal, but we can. Right on the beach and full service."
5671,2886329,4,parkmike,24/06/2023,"Beautiful parking space directly behind the dunes with everything you need and for free. A walk on the beach or a stroll in a nice little town, both are possible. The only downside is that you are next door to each other and it is difficult to get a seat at all!"
5671,2883537,5,AnnelieBe,23/06/2023,"Beautiful pitch, highly recommended behind the dunes. Very quiet. We felt very comfortable and safe. However, the toilet is only for customers of the bar (locked). It comes and goes, if you wait a little bit, a spot will become available again."
5671,2875171,4,garcipollera,20/06/2023,Very good free area with services. Very close to the beach and with a small bar. Restaurants and a small store nearby. What else to ask for
5671,2874693,5,Agg0,20/06/2023,Top place in front of the dunes to the sea
5671,2861867,5,DecioSousa,16/06/2023,Very good. Now with water supply service and dirty water discharge. Divided spaces to avoid wasting places. Very quiet and very close to the beach. we loved
5671,2846323,5,phiphi_5,12/06/2023,Very well laid out right next to the sea in a village to see I recommend
5671,2833026,4,Kimvhees,08/06/2023,"I drove here because of being able to walk the dog. I'm coming, forbidden dog! Pleasant. It was also very busy and noisy."
5671,2830582,5,Bluefin,07/06/2023,"For free...absolutely fantastic! BUT I watched a camper this morning poohing in the dunes! Absolut 'no go'. If you have no own place to pooh, go to a campground and keep this place clean! ( and for free!)"
5671,2829662,5,Phil10kn,07/06/2023,What more. Access to the beach nearby. Modern service area. Many thanks to the community.
5671,2827187,5,isabelllaaa,06/06/2023,"Great pitch near the beach. Beach bar directly on site or within walking distance. Service station new! Outdoor showers available, toilets only for guests of the beach bar (locked). Towards the evening increased arrival of campers. GNR occasionally drives by."
5671,2827009,5,RudolfERNST,06/06/2023,Wonderful location just behind the dune with wooden walkway to the beach. Newly created supply/disposal at the beginning of the two-sided parking/parking lot. Super fine white sand is first class to linger. Beach bars along the beach are connected with wooden walkways.
5671,2813655,5,carlosalmeida,02/06/2023,"An exceptional place to stop, sleep and treat AC. (services). Thanks to the Municipality for the reception."

5671,2786121,5,Xansa,25/05/2023,"Excellent location. A very quiet place, close to the restaurant area. Highly recommended. Thanks to Costa Nova for the water point"
5671,2772239,5,bbouchere,21/05/2023,"Very well placed place, 50m from the beach, near the village and the market where you can find all the excellent consumable foodstuffs (fresh fish, shellfish, vegetables, fruits, breads, pastries). Small downside, the brand new service area is not easily accessible due to too much elevation, I think the finishing works will solve the problem."
5671,2764685,5,Elcanario,19/05/2023,"Great place to spend a few days, with services for ac, the only thing that to throw the water the step is very high and you can load the bumper of the ac. Bars nearby and restaurants where you eat quite well."
5671,2736317,4,jp85,09/05/2023,"very good quiet spot, sea nearby, close to the center, really very good for spending a night or even several. the 5th star is missing because the services are not yet in place. With the finished service area, I think I would finally add 2 more stars!"
5671,2721728,5,przezyciepl,04/05/2023,great place! Silence peace. Camping tolerated. There is even a service available. We spent a few nights here.
5671,2709031,4,mtalhao,30/04/2023,Excellent location close to the beach and all shops and markets. Quiet location. The last star is for when the service area is open.
5671,2704733,5,Kikamper,28/04/2023,"Several delimited places, a very good place to spend the night with a motorhome company, since there were many. Very close to visit the town on foot and right next to the beach. Bathrooms to use without having to consume."
5671,2697357,4,Charlessicot,26/04/2023,"Good location, quiet night, lots of people on site."
5671,2694051,5,Roxymi,24/04/2023,Very good location to visit Costa Nova and sleep.
5671,2688517,3,Pedruchi,22/04/2023,"Next to the beach, well leveled, but a lot of dust and quite a bit of noise from the bar at night. Try to get a seat as far away from the bar as possible. The future AC is seen under construction."
5671,2681533,5,claimm,19/04/2023,"strategic, comfortable place, very close to the beach, the town and the bar"
5671,2640974,5,Darans,05/04/2023,"They are under construction, but soon it will be an AC zone. They are building an emptying and filling area and cleaning the WC. Showers in the bar (see photo) We slept next to about 25 very quiet motorhomes. The spectacular beach. It has no breakwater."
5671,2639365,4,papamoll196,04/04/2023,"Super nice place right on the dunes, super quiet to stay overnight. Sanitary system for gray water drainage ect. Still under construction. Colorful houses mutate immediately behind the promenade. Recommended!"
5671,2637267,4,Aniatxu,03/04/2023,"We slept very well. It has a shower and in the bar there are toilets that anyone can use. The bar, on Sundays does NOT have dinner, the kitchen is closed. Close to the beach and with a bike lane to the town."
5671,2631051,4,Harleydriver,30/03/2023,Beautiful natural course with bar but still without Ver. and disposal which is under construction. Stood here for 2 nights with access to a beautiful sandy beach.
5671,2623765,5,ayoinviaggio,25/03/2023,"Very nice and safe to visit Costa Nova. We didn't stay overnight, but it seems possible because we saw at least 15 campers. A loading/unloading area is also almost ready. Thank you"
5671,2609318,5,ISALU7,14/03/2023,"Excellent parking to visit Costa Nova. We also spent the night with other campers, without any problems. You are practically on the beach. Until around 11pm, you may hear music from the local neighbors, but nothing too annoying. Please leave it clean, always!!"

5671,2586672,5,Rikeiro,22/02/2023,"Good place to enjoy the surroundings and spend the night, it seems that they are finishing an area to evacuate and fill, which could expand the parking area. The Sul Bar restaurant is very nice and cheap food, good vibes and music, a good beach for surfing, and a great wooden promenade."
5671,2578345,4,Hnaveiras,15/02/2023,"Super nice and quiet place. At night there is always AC and other parked vans, I travel alone and I always look for places with more people parked and here I felt super safe. It is next to the beach promenade and has supermarkets and bars a 5-minute walk away."
5671,2524204,4,emax88,18/12/2022,"A stone's throw from the sea with its sand dunes and the village with colorful houses, in this season it is very quiet and there is always room. We spent a quiet night with the sound of the ocean in the background, just beware of a bit of quagmire in case of bad weather. The adjacent bar doesn't make too much noise and there are other bars by the sea (also open in December) with breathtaking views."
5671,2523784,4,BiermannJupp,18/12/2022,"We have been here many times, you can see that the place is well received. Thanks to the community. We know Costa Nova from 1984. (Marauder) JB"

5671,2475223,4,dagipulia,31/10/2022,"A nice place, quiet (21.10.) and right on the dunes. We had a delicious dinner in the city in the evening. About 5 minutes. The bar only opens at 10:00."
5671,2460745,5,ramic_van,24/10/2022,"Beautiful place where we spent the night of October 14. Quiet place, you have the beach next to where we enjoy the sunset. We arrived at 4:00 p.m. and by 6:00 p.m. the parking lot was already full. In summer I suppose it will be impossible to find parking."
5671,2447588,5,MiSchroe,16/10/2022,"Mobile Internet Vodafone or NOS 240/46 MBit mobile work very well possible. Very good location, quiet and straight places."
5671,2445772,5,sophiewiese,15/10/2022,"We recommend! A nice tidy place, there are places on gravel right on the jetty, but you can also stand on the meadow. There is a small bar/cafe on the beach, it's very nice there too! We really enjoyed the night and the day there!!!"
5671,2428679,4,CamperliJuDo,07/10/2022,"Very well placed just behind the dunes, close to small colorful houses, restaurants and the bike path. Also close to the sea! Rolling waves drown out the sound of motorbikes passing in the distance."
5671,2422901,3,Luc1112,04/10/2022,"Large parking lot next to the nicer town, unfortunately dogs are officially forbidden on the jetty and beach, but we still saw some. The internet is good"
5671,2414651,4,Joss44,30/09/2022,We stayed 1 night. Perfect for visiting Costa nova and its pretty houses and walking along the beach. Quiet place except for the sound of the sea.

5671,2323319,5,Eltorado,30/08/2022,"Great place! In addition to the parking lot, everyone also parks along the street on the grass. A few steps from the beach. Unfortunately the toilet belongs to the bar. You have to go a bit further (two toilets along the beach and one in the main street with striped houses). Gladly again!"
5671,2318955,4,fragonetis,29/08/2022,"Very quiet place even being very crowded especially in the afternoons. To put some downside is that the showers and bathrooms are from the bar that is next to the parking lot, so they are only available when it is open."

5671,2289081,5,Novatis,23/08/2022,"We arrived around 6:30 pm, people were leaving the beach and we had no problem parking. There were many motorhomes and a beach bar but the atmosphere was very calm. There is also a soccer field which is great if you go with children. We will repeat for sure."
5671,2287706,5,xavifv,23/08/2022,"We arrived around 1pm and slept one night. Phenomenal. Quite crowded, the gaps last minutes, but you sleep well. 100% recommendable"

The main street with the typical houses at 1 minute. let's go privileged location. Let's take care of these types of sites, so that they continue to allow us to spend the night in places like this."
5671,2251849,5,VANNY114,16/08/2022,"Fantastic. You can only put the glue on the floor, which stains. Please take care of it, it's just a parking lot, but for location and tranquility it's worth it."
5671,2247003,5,joanes,16/08/2022,Perfect. Camper atmosphere. The town one step away. Beach one step away. Fishmonger one step away. No noise. Wonderful sunset. What more could you want.
5671,2240630,4,P.Coto,15/08/2022,"Good place to sleep, bar and garbage containers, one minute from the beach and three minutes from the main avenue, with its striped houses and its spectacular promenade. As for parking, if there is room in the grassy area, much better than the sandy one, as the van gets very dirty. Special place to which I will return for sure."
5671,2239384,5,fers23,14/08/2022,"We slept one night and it was great. Quite crowded, the gaps last minutes, but you sleep great and great atmosphere of AC and vans. 100% recommendable"
5671,2236576,5,bazmonffamily,14/08/2022,"Quiet night, the bar next door did not bring any nuisance if you are a little further. The toilets are a good 7min walk away though. Our neighbors even barbecued next door. More friendly and calm atmosphere"
5671,2227350,5,GureAmetza,13/08/2022,"We spent 2 nights here and perfect, there should be more places like this. Very quiet beach bar to order whatever you want, beach 1 minute away and free cold showers. Arrive early because there is a lot of space but many AC and vans and maybe you will not have a place if you arrive late."
5671,2224333,2,BeaFelipe,12/08/2022,"crowded! We came last night and there was nowhere, all the Ac and vans parked super close to each other. We went to the other car park and it was also full (they are under construction) it was late and we were able to park in a small space that was left but it smelled of sewage/pipes. The showers in the bar can be used for free and the beach is very close."

5671,2211326,4,flechiE7,10/08/2022,Good place to spend the quiet night near the beach and the town with a bar nearby (Sul) it lets you use the outside showers even if you are not a client. Good atmosphere of camper and caravans that if we recommend arriving not too late because the site is limited.
5671,2208902,5,fanny29800,10/08/2022,Great location by the sea and close to the village. There are a lot of motorhomes but it seems to move throughout the day. We recommend

5671,2087543,5,bempie,17/07/2022,Good place without facilities but the possibility for a cold shower after swimming. Very busy during the day with beach visitors but wonderfully quiet in the evening/night. We will stay here an extra night.

5671,2062953,5,PatriPalma,12/07/2022,"Incredible location, at the foot of the Dunes and the walkway to the Costa Nova Beach. Totally free. Quiet place to sleep. It was a Sunday in July, quite late and we still had no problem parking. There is a beach bar next door. You can walk to the Ría area, with the colorful houses. We loved it."
5671,2047285,4,arlenebaart,07/07/2022,"Perfect place for the night! Directly behind the dune, with a beautiful view and showers to rinse off. Cozy atmosphere, you can put your table and chairs on the grass. The sea was too wild, so it was not possible to (really) swim, so we left after one night. Recommended!"
5671,2047275,4,AlexisRC,07/07/2022,"Excellent location on the first line of the dunes, when we arrived at night there was fog (in July) and we could not see anything, we could hear the church bells and in the morning we saw that there was a church 200 meters away, very quiet at night without no noise despite there being about 20 motorhomes"
5671,2045388,5,maruso,07/07/2022,"Very cozy place, and appetizing, one of those that you have to take care of. We stopped to eat, but since there weren't good days at the beach, we didn't stay any longer."

5671,2017161,5,Cesip,27/06/2022,luxury place by the beach. bar next door. cold showers in the beach bar. the only bad thing is that the beach has cold water and poor people who depend on the roof that can be raised by the air
5671,2003556,5,loppieontour,23/06/2022,"Perfect place for a quiet night. Right at the beach crossing. In the evening some noise from beach bar but otherwise completely quiet. It was busy with campers, places were full around 9 p.m"

5671,1866134,4,Baltus,02/05/2022,"Great place for one night. You walk quickly to the village which is really worth it. You don't have to stand there because of the view, but in the evening it is nice and quiet. There are also no amenities. We had to do the laundry (laundry within walking distance) so we stayed one night."
5671,1864675,4,Masmoudi,01/05/2022,"We ended up spending the night here. However, on the adjacent meadow. There were already other WoMo's there. I did not see an official sign on the paved area. But that's how it went. Calm! Only the Atlantic could be heard behind the dunes."
5671,1823611,5,moumeyers,15/04/2022,"We spent one night here and we were very comfortable, there is a lot of space and we were accompanied by many other campers and motorhomes. Calm and safe, some dunes separate you from the beach and cut the air a bit. very good place"
5671,1821999,4,mentequi,14/04/2022,"No services But it has a bar next to it, the beach can be reached in 2 minutes by a walkway, that is if it is a very windy area. The colored houses are on the other side of the town. It's worth it, the sunsets are beautiful."

5671,1780593,4,TinaWrighty,12/03/2022,"Our GPS brought us 'from behind' through the town to this place and we wanted to continue first. Luckily we got out and walked through the town. There are beautiful houses there, the beach is a dream with its high waves. In the evening we went to an absolutely great restaurant. In the end it was one of the most beautiful stops on our trip so far."
5671,1777532,5,jolinepascal,08/03/2022,Beautiful place close to the beach and town. Nice little place for a drink/eat right next to the place. Locals also appreciate it when you have a drink here.
5671,1777493,5,diiiddz,08/03/2022,"Perfect car park! We were several vans and motorhomes, but there is a lot of space without being on top of each other, perfect for visiting Costa Nova!"
5671,1775706,5,George1207,06/03/2022,Beautiful spot right on the beach and in walking distance to the pretty town with lots of nice restaurants to choose from. Very popular and users should not push their luck by putting out tables and chairs.

5671,1754858,4,alatardecer,13/02/2022,"Near the center and near the beach. When we were there, it was possible to sleep very peacefully until 8 in the morning when the bells of the church next door ring and a dog comes out wanting to walk barking. for the all very good. level ground floor. we feel comfortable."
5671,1753707,5,RabeaSepp,12/02/2022,Super nice parking lot! Out of season nobody says anything about the dogs. Most people here actually have one with them.
5671,1749710,5,CARPAT,07/02/2022,"Great place as described, we spent the day and the night very calm bordered by the sound of the waves"
5671,1735301,3,Hardy59,16/01/2022,"Beautiful parking space, which is unfavorable for dog owners, as stepping on the wooden walkways that lead to the beach is prohibited. We chose the place south. There were no prohibitions and problems there."
5671,1698484,5,BiMo58,26/11/2021,"Great place, quiet, clean and a bit lit by the adjoining house and church! But the place 300 m further south-west is also recommended, but a bit more restless because of the anglers!"
5671,1693290,5,gyzmo35,19/11/2021,"Quiet parking without services, come autonomous. Nice location by the sea, calm. Shops and center 2 steps away. We stayed there for 2 days, no problem despite going through the guardia. Perfect and the town is cute."

There is no service but THANKS to the municipality."

5671,1617037,5,Andrea-Dinis,29/09/2021,"Perfect place to sleep, we arrived in the afternoon and very quiet. With AC and campers. Very close to the colorful houses of Costa Nova.

5671,1530837,5,LaSardinha,30/08/2021,"Crowded during the day but quiet at night. Next to both the beach and the estuary. Lots of AC with awnings and planted tables, though that doesn't seem to be a nuisance to anyone. Public showers and toilets for bar guests."

5671,1496287,4,Baldufa,22/08/2021,"An ideal place to spend the day and also to spend the night. Just behind the beach. In August it was very crowded, especially during the day it is difficult to find parking. In the evening cars leave and there is some more space left. No services. It’s a parking lot, not an area, but some users don’t respect it and camped out. If it is not respected they will soon put restrictions."
5671,1471899,3,Carlosmude,17/08/2021,The perfect place but people leave a lot of separation between fires and AC to deploy ... it will be a matter of time that you will not be able to park ...

5671,1434606,5,Vikmek,10/08/2021,"Practically on the beach. Without services, but with the possibility of showers and toilets in the bar. It is a good place both to go to the beach and to visit the area, even with a bike path next to the estuary. Very comfortable, good atmosphere !!!"

Although the bells of a nearby church ring every half hour, they stop at 23:00 and restart at 8:00. Costa Nova is 5 minutes away and the beach at the end of the parking lot with an impressive sunset."
5671,1371423,3,MizzGc,27/07/2021,Great spot. Shame about the church bells ringing non stop overnight :( we didn’t sleep a wink

5671,1307281,5,_grendel_,09/07/2021,"Great free spot by the beach. Waste bins, outdoor cold water showers. Bar, during bar opening hours (until 22:00), well-kept toilets can be used. A wooden walking platform along the beach. We stayed here for two days, it was not crowded like in the picture, the parking lot is almost empty."
5671,1305919,5,alis68,08/07/2021,Really great spot next to the beach. There is a nice little bar (with good burgers) !

5671,1266163,5,kiranchor,20/06/2021,"The best place of our entire trip. There is a small café right next to the parking lot, where you can use the toilets during the day. There are showers that are available all day. Beautiful place and numerous restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Very friendly people in the place. Perfect."
5671,1264174,4,MellyD,19/06/2021,"Great place. Almost nothing going on in June. I was all alone on a rainy day. Official parking lot for mobiles of all kinds. There is a lot of wind here and in the evening you can hear the bass from the small café next door. The direct beach location with the wide, wild beach with lots of shells make things go away again. Bright Schitterplatz and next to it some places in the grass. Flat floor. Very pleasant."

5671,1245869,5,Petit_periple,09/06/2021,"We came to this parking lot a week ago to spend the night there. Great spot, we were only two vans. A large sandy beach at 50 meters. The city is super pretty."
5671,1192232,4,Marypk,11/05/2021,"We slept there and the GNR passed and there was no problem. Very quiet place to sleep next to the beach with a beach bar. The walk of the typical houses at 5 min., The market to buy and the restaurants."
5671,1095790,4,sunlightPT,16/10/2020,"Quiet location by the sea, close to the estuary and the market. It is a pity that certain motorhomes are allowed to park at length instead of doing it across the road, which would allow more vacant seats."
5671,1095630,4,Nagotxu,16/10/2020,"Natural setting, close to the beach. Very quiet, but gets crowded easy. Nearby parking lots are similar. No bathroom, just a cafeteria, which is closed half the year."
5671,1091290,3,Albanel,12/10/2020,Comfortable place without more. No services. The town deserves a walk.
5671,1086251,5,pollitosdeexcursion,08/10/2020,"Very quiet, pleasant and safe place. There is a football field boiling in front and a wooden bridge that takes you directly to the beach. Sheltered by a dune from the wind but less than the next parking lot. We cook without problem with the table out. Barely lit, the ground is made of pebbles and sand. Next to it is a bar that we read that had toilets and showers but we found it closed, I suppose because it was low season. Great place, you can't see the sea because of the dune that covers it but you can hear the waves breaking all night."
5671,1061381,4,arratie,20/09/2020,"We had a good night, 5 minutes walk from restaurants. The great beach. The showers were not operational, I do not know if because of the covid or because it is September."
5671,1058602,3,Emirodriguez,19/09/2020,Quiet place to spend the night. The showers are closed and the bathroom until 19:00
5671,1036200,3,borjitax,09/09/2020,"It is quiet but the next is better. This one is full of gravel and you get a lot of dirt in the AC. The next parking lot is just as quiet, but it's gritty. By the way the showers are not good. Better shower in the AC"

Near supermarket and bar, a step away from the area of the houses and the promenade. I recommend it because the town is beautiful and it is also an excellent place to visit Aveiro. There is a five-minute direct bus that plants you there in twenty minutes. In addition the area is very good if you go with a dog, where there is a great rural soccer field for running with our four-legged friend, and the beach, as it is wild and unguarded, you can also take it.

Bike path right next to it and of good quality. 8€ per day and payment for parking is very closely monitored (a bit too much?). Fairground next door with loud music but didn't bother us.

Bike lane along the maritime avenue. There is a fair next door but it did not bother us and it also rained a little in the afternoon which helped to reduce the movement of people. very quiet night"
5673,2255691,4,juanmator,17/08/2022,Large aerial next to the beach and the center...water change and emptying. next to a small fair that does not bother to sleep more than the typical noise. They charge a maximum of 8 euros a day for the blue zone that goes from 8 in the morning to 6 in the afternoon... from 6 and to sleep they do not charge. very saturated
5673,2254392,4,ToInfinityAndBeyond,17/08/2022,"Parking area by the beach and in the city centre of Figueira da Foz. Was just there for the maintenance, free water, grey and black disposal. The parking lot is huge but it gets very busy and the space for each motorhome is just enough, so the motorhomes are super close to one another. When so busy I rather park somewhere else."
5673,2234323,3,colmass88,14/08/2022,"Parking a bit overcrowded, next to the area there is a small fair and from 2200 you have a carnival, so to sleep on these regular dates, Sundays and holidays you do not pay, next to the area you have a small beach, very friendly people who do not They hesitate to help and the city has a lot of life at night, I haven't gotten to try the showers and there is no light"

Thanks to the previous user for the tip of the showers under the clock tower. It's super clean and inexpensive. The downside despite everything is the carnival nearby, you won't sleep before 1am..."

5673,2082061,5,sarayespinosa29,16/07/2022,"We only came for the showers, because our water system failed, but we did not stay to sleep. It's very good, because at the end of the car park there is a place to empty black and gray water and to fill up with clean water. We had a bit of trouble finding the showers, which are outside the car park, under the clock tower. They are very clean and have a space to store clothes, mobile or whatever, it's like an individual locker room. We have been in July and they close at 7:00 p.m. The lady is very kind."
5673,2038432,4,Yazzzzzy,04/07/2022,"Perfectly nice car park near the beach, restaurants and shops. Water and space to empty grey and black although quite dirty area. No sort of nice camping in the outdoors vibe but exactly what you expect from a town car park."
5673,2007227,2,paulgo,24/06/2022,"Apart from the beach, which is magnificent, the rest is of no particular interest. In addition funfair up next to the car park which seems to be there all summer so noise until 1 am. Crowded camping car park so no space between each. To avoid"
5673,2006835,4,timbarnard,24/06/2022,"In some ways it's ideal, next to the beach, in the centre, all the facilities etc. But being in the centre brings noise! the Sao Joao festival was on, the first night was OK, the next door fun fair finished about midnight and the competing music at the arena about 1am. The next night!! funfair 2am and the DJ 5.50am so loud we expected our 3.5 tonne van to have moved with all the vibration!!"

5673,1980955,4,fbrunner,16/06/2022,"From June onwards, when the city's popular festivals begin, at night there is a lot of noise, due to the musical shows that take place nearby. You have to be a very heavy sleeper to get to sleep before the shows are over, which doesn't happen before midnight."

The wifi doesn't work on site either, only upstairs near the toilets."
5673,1845758,5,suasuasombra,22/04/2022,"A very comfortable place. Ample to park, good to empty and fill water. The beach next door, a lighthouse, the promenade... you have to pay 0.80 cents an hour from 8am to 6pm. We had no problem getting up at 10 am, without the ticket, because we forgot. In any case, we believe that it is only paid in the summer"
5673,1833064,5,Abuelo,17/04/2022,"Perfect to visit the area, quiet at this time, I recommend it"
5673,1828913,4,alfag11,16/04/2022,"We slept in the van in the parking lot next door. Very good location and next to the parking there are very clean public toilets and showers. The bad thing is that being a weekend, it is a bit noisy: there was a lot of movement of cars and some people having a drink."

5673,1785886,3,reinersms,17/03/2022,"The place is clean and OK, but .... the city is absolutely unattractive. High-rise buildings near the beach and behind them much to decay. The parking space is a simple, large parking lot, but really only for mobile homes and probably also monitored by cameras. The beach is probably an attraction in summer and due to the many high-rise buildings it is also well frequented. We won't come here anymore"
5673,1783951,3,steini1972,15/03/2022,"The pitch costs €0.80 per hour from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. There is a supply and disposal, tar space on the outskirts"

Walk across the pier to the lighthouse and sundowners in the small bar on the beach. The coordinates are wrong, but the given address is easy to find. The coordinates are: N40°8'51.9 W8°52'5.1"

I was there for 3 days, at the weekend there was a party in the fort (right next to the parking) but I sleep through it, no music at night (I think, since I am a regular sleeper) TIP: drive to the address myself because I don't think the coordinates are right, I was wrong. With a large motorhome it could be difficult."
5673,1748800,4,WindySouls,06/02/2022,"Top car park. Paying per day, weekdays. Directly located near the beach and promenade. Can be a bit noisy as it is close to the road and a car park. But good!"

Paid parking, however, between 13:00 on Saturday and 8:00 on Monday, it is not paid. Nice location, close to the river and the sea. The dumps area was full, with gray and black water everywhere and an extremely unpleasant smell."

5673,1551536,1,LauraCfb,06/09/2021,"We went to sleep and the experience was not really good. Noise from the attractions, noise from the kids partying until late at night, an area full of AC and squares so fair that you barely open the doors, which can generate conflicts with neighbors, depending on who knocks or come out with a scratch on the street. lock. Not recommended for sleeping or parking AC for 4 places or more."

It can get loud at night when partying. But don't do anything to anyone. Disposal is getting on in years, but works. You have to pay from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m."
5673,1521685,1,Mireille34350,28/08/2021,"We had to decamp at 3:30 am, very noisy, a bunch of revelers screaming, screaming, wandering all night long in the crowded parking lot of very tight Camping Cars. There was very strong pressure exerted on motorhome operators to leave the area and allow a gang to regroup. Bad experience on a CC area after 3 weeks in Portugal."
5673,1508427,4,jerovega7,24/08/2021,"Quiet area, although there are some fairground attractions nearby, there is not too much noise and you can sleep without problem. The emptying and filling services are correct and there is no problem with the black emptying area, it is solved. Ideal to get to know Figueira da Foz, its castle, municipal market and enjoy the nearby beaches."
5673,1506809,3,oliiislife,24/08/2021,"The sewage drain was full and clogged, the water fill and gray drain was fine. At night you can hear some screams from people who are partying there. For the rest very well."

5673,1171965,4,fbrunner,11/04/2021,"We spent a few nights here and were lucky: no problem with noise at night. However, we consider the price charged all year long during the week (10 euros per day) excessive for what is offered (without electricity) and discriminatory with motorhomes, as in the adjoining parking lot (for light cars) there is only a charge from June to September ."
5673,1089292,2,mtalhao,11/10/2020,"Excellent location with services. Flat parking. The noise at night is chaos. Cars making tops, techno music until dawn. I recommend to visit Figueira and the beach, but not to stay overnight."

In front of it is a small park, the market hall and coffee to bridge the waiting time. We stood here for 3 nights without any problems. Disposal is good. Refueling water is problematic. Hose systems do not fit. Only small canisters can be filled. For 1 star deduction. Lidl is reachable on the beach in 1.9 km. Great bike path on the beach and promenade. Great waves.

During the day, the place costs € 0.60 per hour, a maximum of € 8.00 per day. The parking machine was however broken yesterday. The location right on the beach is great. The places for the motorhomes are especially large in the middle, so that there is also space for large motorhomes. At night it was very quiet despite the road nearby. Perfect for sightseeing or hiking on the beach."

Negative points: it is not controlled, you settle as you can, where you can. Cars occupy spaces for campers or park in front of them, preventing them from moving. Very dirty CS area. It is also true that we were there on Sunday, in August, at the height of the nightlife .. so everything was acceptable."

If there is some training because it is next to a car park and there is a lot of movement, but that is why, because it is well located, we want everything ..., you have to pay. We read that people did not pay and we were fined € 5. It is reasonable. Direct access to the beach, bike path to the other end, bars and restaurants next door. We were in August and it is next to the lighthouse where they do events and concerts, a bit annoying if you go to sleep soon, we with a four-year-old girl, but if you go for a walk, have dinner and go out for a while, by twelve o'clock it ends. It is more than acceptable. Recommended one hundred percent. I wish we had areas like that in Spain."

5674,137334,3,cmdeg,25/05/2017,One night on this parking mid-May 2017. Nice sea view but not very quiet night. Vehicles that stop and leave with people who discuss and in the early morning fishermen who meet and talk loudly before going fishing on the rocks
5674,113323,4,emile84,03/11/2016,"End of October, calm night. Nice view of the sea"

5681,3187560,3,AfonsoSousa,20/08/2023,Nice and spacious place but the toilets and showers were out of order and the WIFI network is weak and with little range. I recommend it but you should take these factors into account.
5681,3185523,1,sandrinecarlier,20/08/2023,it helps for one night but otherwise the toilets are closed and no luck we had noisy neighbors in short a bad night
5681,3181447,3,VintageCamping,19/08/2023,"simple and cheap, but few conditions. well centered."
5681,3154841,3,Rcav,15/08/2023,"We liked it! Positive experience! At the entrance they choose the service, pay and the gate opens. Coins needed to fill water, only 2€ I think. The toilets were closed. It's super spacious but it doesn't have any shade, it's suitable for the kids to ride their bikes, etc. From Tuesday to Wednesday it's closed because there's a Friday on Wednesday and then there's a plot next door where you can stay without paying."
5681,3128811,5,Partner2023,12/08/2023,Very good park. He had energy and was very quiet. Just didn't have the bathrooms working.
5681,3110290,4,claireetmicka,09/08/2023,Large and spacious motorhome area. 6 euros for 24 hours. Nothing to say except it's a bit noisy at night because not far from the road.
5681,3102269,4,Annaroby2016,08/08/2023,Safe place to stay overnight. Not particularly clean. Functioning water loading service (€ 2 for 100 liters). We didn't need electricity.
5681,2968292,1,ItziarSL,15/07/2023,"You can go inside to empty and fill for an hour, but it is very dirty, it smells horrible and also the water did not work..."
5681,2965988,2,myfriendstan1,15/07/2023,"Had a problem on entry (the barrier came down before we had a chance to get back in van) so we had to pay twice. If you have partner with you, get them to make payment etc. Bit of a grim outlook but functional for an overnight."
5681,2936642,5,BartandKlaudia,08/07/2023,"Easy to enter, really quiet, not a lot of campers when we stayed. Facilities are there although we didn’t try the toilets. Felt very safe"
5681,2801287,1,Capitano1,30/05/2023,"The many flight movements, especially late into the night and very early in the morning, are really annoying. Positive is the Lidl right around the corner and the beach promenade and beaches that are easy to reach by bike."
5681,2792887,2,domiheyLA,27/05/2023,"The one thing you expect when coming to a paid area is toilets, which are closed. Otherwise very noisy (barking dogs, street, planes). Come here only for a night if you have to, otherwise I advise to go somewhere else."
5681,2777307,4,joiedevivre,22/05/2023,Area very well. pity that you have to leave on Tuesday for the market on Wednesday. Fairly quiet at night. Faro airport Not too far and from 5:30 am a few planes take off. Fairly well. Otherwise you have the bus that can take you right to quarteira for the beaches. €2.60 per person.
5681,2721550,3,jamieshoard,04/05/2023,"It’s ok. Not many places in the area so convenient if you just need to sleep. Big car park, lots of plastic bags and remands from the market. €6 euros per night on a convenient ticket machine by the gate. Arrived here after being advised by GNR the beach spot toward Faro was not ok for overnight."
5681,2708433,3,luissilva1971,30/04/2023,this service area is well located with Lidl at the door and the bus stop too but it is not correct that we have to leave the place on Tuesdays because of the fair that takes place there.
5681,2695188,5,taitai10,25/04/2023,Currently quiet place with beautiful pitches. 6 euros with really cheap electricity. too bad no toilets and you have to leave on Tuesday to make way for the market
5681,2684136,1,Anfrie,20/04/2023,"The water didn't work, the whole place made a rather unclean impression. You couldn't sleep well at night: first the garbage truck drove twice over the square and then the planes flying in to Faro disturbed you. If it is not absolutely necessary, I would continue."
5681,2673378,4,N.Batista,16/04/2023,the price is the best 6€ already with electricity. the doorman is a very attentive gentleman. already the water supply machine failed to put 2€ it didn't work but the next day the doorman solved it. I will come back.
5681,2605916,5,gfenn05,11/03/2023,Great place. Lots of space. Community employees help clear or re-occupy the space after the market. Top organized. Compliments and thanks to the staff
5681,2601684,5,Excalibur157,07/03/2023,"For 6 € a great place with electricity supply and disposal. City about 2 km - very nice marina about 3 km. Long wide promenade with shops and restaurants. The payment system is in 4 languages / payment only with card. For. a few nights great, but there are always rings that something doesn't fit. You should be happy that there are places like this."
5681,2601207,3,ScottCSchank,06/03/2023,"This place is nice, but basic. The check-in is self-service and a little confusing. I stopped my engine to get out and buy the ticket. By the time I got back in and started the engine, the gate had opened and closed again. Tried to insert my ticket a second time, and the system said that I was already in the park(!) Had to buy a second ticket with a fake license plate number. Many of the spaces are uneven enough to require balancing. The dump station is in an awkward place. All in all, it was adequate, but far from special."
5681,2595282,4,Lukullus,01/03/2023,"We stood here two nights. It was ok. Unfortunately we couldn't bunker water, despite the money being inserted, the tap stayed dry. €6.00 with electricity is really cheap."
5681,2590174,4,DianaMahr,25/02/2023,We stayed here for two nights. 48 hours 12 euros with electricity (6A). Large space and there were still many spaces available. It was perfect for us.
5681,2587988,4,Sunshine04,23/02/2023,"The price performance ratio is very good. suitable for vehicles with their own sanitary area. You will look in vain for showers and toilets. It's just a large area that's nice to stand on, quiet at night and guarded."
5681,2585176,5,FranziAimee,20/02/2023,"The place is not nice, but for 6 € you stand on straight places (fine gravel and cobblestones); Electricity (6A) and disposal included. The adjacent street is noisy and there are only a few electricity pillars, so depending on the space, you need very long power cables. The value for money is still excellent for one or two nights."
5681,2577238,4,parknight1731,13/02/2023,"Nice area well placed near the supermarket and the city center with free shuttle service. Lots of room, a very affordable price 6 euros with electricity. Quiet night despite the very large number of vehicles. Too bad the toilets are closed"
5681,2565143,3,Werven26,31/01/2023,Great location for 6 euros per night. For this price you get electricity and you can deposit. Fresh drinking water 3 euros 100 litres. Busy place with many hibernators. Good for a nice bike ride through the Quintas and the golf resort. Beach season at 2 km. Move on after 2 days.
5681,2559948,4,robert717,25/01/2023,It is getting fuller with campers and especially campers with trailers. Now on Wednesday at the Parking it is completely overcrowded and especially campers with a trailer car that takes up a lot of space.
5681,2542265,3,ginette-royer,05/01/2023,not bad as a camping area because it's a pity that the water is not included in the package and that the toilets are also closed
5681,2531419,2,zucche,28/12/2022,"The place is ok, but for me it's not worth the price. I stopped to do the service, the guy at the reception was very friendly. I paid 3 euros to empty waters and 2 euros for almost 75% clean water, a scam."
5681,2524157,5,sjmotorhome,18/12/2022,"Firstly ignore the negative for this area, for location and price this is 5 star. If your looking for a five star campsite, then go to a campsite and not here. However if you want somewhere that is perfectly cheap with plenty of space then this place is perfect. We have been here twice and stayed for four nights on both occasions."
5681,2444344,4,chilo888,15/10/2022,"Spacious area, practical for long jigs. Bus line 9 and 66 200m to the right when leaving, 4.50€ for Faro. Calm night, without particular nuisance. Too bad the water terminal only works with a €2 coin only. A tank of non-potable water is however available."

5681,1712411,5,robert717,19/12/2021,Still a fantastic place to be. Power supplies have also been improved across the site from front to rear power points. There is now also an entrance ticket machine.

6297,2391645,5,gusaez,21/09/2022,We have been for the second year and super good. The showers are free which is appreciated and they are clean. The only thing better is to park in the lots that are farthest from the road because it has a lot of traffic.
6297,2345644,5,Archelon5,06/09/2022,"We are there and the description corresponds to the services and the price. As often, you need to have an additional means of transport to make the most of the beaches and the city.

We accept criticism, but let it be justified. Greetings from Paraiso Camper"
6297,1129184,5,paraisocamper,08/01/2021,"Dear 737italy, we do not think it right that you rate our camper area without visiting it. The door was closed because with the covid we have reduced the reception hours. We have reduced the reception hours due to the reduction in employment that our area has suffered. Among other things, because for the safety of our customers we have reduced the number of pitches offered."

6297,798923,2,Mayte64,16/04/2020,"The site is ideal to stay many days, we have been specifically for years since it opened. I can not give more stars because the girls who are now do not attend to anything well and many days at 17 hours there is nobody. You ask questions and they don't answer you. It will be difficult for us to return. We are sorry for Jose the owner who took him wonderfully. A pity"
6297,756092,2,himo,23/12/2019,Check their Website for correct pricing so you will not be surpriced on arrival.

6297,746079,2,alise59,23/11/2019,Very nice home. Parking stack of CC as everywhere in Calpe. A group of 15 to 20 people made a fuss not possible all afternoon. The next day we were treated to German music on awakening. Check the electricity meter when you arrive because any consumption above 5 KW / day is charged 0.35 E KW. In the end it is more expensive than announced initially.
6297,745075,5,peremerito,19/11/2019,It's very good

6297,588447,5,paraisocamper,31/07/2019,"Hi Harryzen Do not include Paraiso Camper in your accusation regarding this prohibition. Before accusing, you have to inform yourself. The parking ban coincided with the opening of the 2 Sol de Calpe campsites (with important links in the Calpe City Council). Who will be the culprit? That said, don't put us all in the same bag. Rectify is wise ... Greetings"

6297,555185,5,paraisocamper,15/07/2019,"Hello Mayoamo, we are open to criticism, as long as they are respectful and constructive. Your first opinion was not and the second less. Freedom of expression does not mean being able to disregard the truth or respect. by the way the rule to which I refer is the RD 16/2015 of the Valencian Generalitat and you can check it in our internal regulations. We comply with the law."
6297,553292,5,paraisocamper,14/07/2019,"Dear Mayoamo. It seems to me a very unfortunate comment of yours, also without arguments. As I have told you by phone, your dogs are well received, but they are considered dangerous breed in the Valencian community and therefore they must wear a muzzle at all times. We look for the good of our clients. The other area does not comply with the law, almost certainly does not know. regards"
6297,553149,1,Mayoamo,14/07/2019,"All very nice until you tell them that you have two dogs considered PPP and already start the absurd clichés and clichés. In the end we decided not to go so as not to feel uncomfortable as it seemed that my animals were not well received, knowing that they probably behave much better than others who will be at ease there. There is another area nearby that is great and do not put any stick."

The facilities are great, always clean and tidy, with hot showers. The pitches are not large, but that is the way of things when you get so near to the Mediterranean. Having said that, they are large enough to be able to sit outside in the sun! There are mature trees across the site, and lots of water points. Each pitch has electric hook up. The staff are helpful and friendly. We would definitely stay again"

Highly recommended for the services, I can't tell you the rest!"
6351,3149748,3,Fafa1,15/08/2023,Crowded mid August but beautiful pitches and lots of possible activities. Friendly at reception. For 44 euros you still have to pay 2 euros to empty the cassette with the automatic machine......

6351,2999444,5,Nortenosenruta,21/07/2023,"We spent a week on vacation and it did not seem like a campsite that is quite clean and with good facilities. The plot that we got was quite wide and despite being a sunny plot, the trees shaded us. Delighted so we will return."
6351,2929159,2,miaandbeth,06/07/2023,This camp site is very over priced at €36.80 for one night. We stayed at a x10 better one in Benidorm for €21.80 and it was so much better. This camp site over powered by people who live here. We decided not to go ahead and just paid €6 to empty our cassette toilet instead.
6351,2851992,5,luzbelito,13/06/2023,"In my opinion the best camping I've been so far. Good attention, very large plots and above all in the natural environment that they are. A few meters away, many beach bars with a very good atmosphere (Recommended Portofino Restaurant) and enjoy my people ❤️."
6351,2818213,5,lopezbenitez,04/06/2023,"For now it is the best campsite we have known. Totally kid friendly with lots of activities.

Many games for teenagers but on reservation and for little ones only 1 swing! fortunately 2 swimming pools including 1 heated!"

6351,2691745,3,petramilster,23/04/2023,"Well-groomed place, unfortunately everything is very narrow, if you like to stand close together, you are in good hands here. Showers clean a bit dark but absolutely ok. The place is on a major road, but it didn't bother us. Only if you want to go to the beach you have to walk about 10 to 15 minutes over a roundabout."
6351,2691638,1,LorraineundManuel,23/04/2023,"Value for money doesn't work at all. Dirty and run down with cockroaches in the showers. It would have been ok for €10 a night. Absolutely not.

6351,2560490,2,WolfgangFuchs,25/01/2023,"Not a location for a short stay. Our place was very very small and dark. The forest floor was not equipped with gravel. Due to a thunderstorm, our camper was covered by the forest floor about 1.5 meters high. A cleaning on site was not possible for us. The booked sauna was a letdown. After 2 hours it was already!! reached 69 degrees. The sanitary area was clean."
6351,2559065,5,StefanPeters,23/01/2023,"Huge campsite with cozy pitches in the shade of pine trees. The sports equipment is old, but works, the sanitary facilities are extremely clean.

6351,2552799,5,DoroVagabond,15/01/2023,"Camping near dunes and a beautiful beach. The way there is via the Autobahn.

Very little space for the reception of the parabola. We ended up finding a good reception at the D 7. Otherwise great location and all the comforts with a person at the reception who speaks a little French."
6351,2505249,4,Kikitravels,25/11/2022,It is a short walk to the marina and beach. You can arrive early (website says arrival is anytime that reception is open) for the site which is advisable so you can see what pitches they have available. The showers and toilets were clean and the site was quiet. Would stay again
6351,2493628,1,Vandiamo,13/11/2022,"Could only rate 1 star due to us not being able to access the site. Our 9m van is very low slung & not a powerful engine. The entrance is very steep, although difficult to tell from the photo & if we had got stuck we would not have been able to reverse back up. BUT reception were very understanding & let us park on the land just outside"

The way to the sea via the motorway is not so great, but therefor a nice, large beach with various bars. The villages around are also quite pretty. Point of criticism: traffic jams in the driveway when several AC arrive at the same time."

6351,1950774,3,PetziLanz,06/06/2022,"I was there one night with the motorhome. I personally didn't like it. Too big campsite with many people, barking dogs and screaming children. Generally too much noise. And for one night €27.50. The most expensive place I've ever been. Many park their cars in front of the caravans, so the paths can sometimes be very narrow for a large mobile home."

We have two young children and the indoor playground was often closed on the day and that in the high season, a week before Easter. In addition, the sanitary facilities were unhygienic. Toilets very rancid and cockroaches in the shower. You won't see us here anymore."

6351,1710719,4,victoires,16/12/2021,"Very nice campsite, super equipped with heated swimming pool (30degres) access to the beach is 500m, a bus 200m takes you to Marbella. 20th price for clean 2pers, nickel sanitary facilities. The campsite would just have to take care of the old caravans that look like slum dwellings ... However, we will come back to them without any problem. the resa via the site does not give the real situation"
6351,1708220,4,maloox89,11/12/2021,"Nice campsite/village 20€ with ACSI card in December, many sanitary blocks, heated free swimming pool and many trees/plants...actually the best campsite we stayed in Spain up to now.

We had a problem on the day of departure, before departure time, which caused us to take longer than expected and they showed very little empathy as they overcharged us."
6351,1330187,4,Califurgo,16/07/2021,"Large plots and many to spare. New and comfortable bathrooms, large showers. Few bathrooms for the number of people who have the camping x what queues form in the afternoon x to shower. Great facilities"

Quiet (if you have a pitch towards the top: prefer these pitches because at the bottom or in the middle much noisier and no sea view), fairly clean, beautiful swimming pool. You can't hear the noise from the highway. Staff not very pleasant, you have to ask them questions otherwise you can manage ☹️ Many free places at the moment. Beach 300m away on foot, magnificent location."
6351,773921,3,Helton,29/01/2020,Stayed here during Storm Gloria. As previously mentioned lots of permanent residents (mainly Brits it seemed to us but that probably reflects the area). Very close to A7 and cycle routes limited as a result. Regular buses to Marbella and further up the coast. Okay for a couple of nights but any longer I'm not sure.
6351,770640,3,JuergenD,20/01/2020,"Very large campsite on a steep slope. The AC rows below are very close to the noisy A7. Full in winter by permanent campers. We had 2 places in row J to choose from, which were free for 2-3 days. Both were, like most places, but totally in the shade of large pine trees. After 1 night we had resin on the car. Sanitary ok, nice warm swimming pool with plexiglass cover. 1 night with ACSI € 20, otherwise € 26."

After hearing more information it sounds like it was a gang shooting but made us a bit unnerved for our final days and night."
6351,662644,3,LAXIENA,27/08/2019,"We have been lucky with the plot that touched us. It was large, located in the street of the Bungalows. Out of there all very crowded and overwhelming.

Very high end camping ... residing motorhome and motor home long stay ultra equipped. Paradise for children with swimming pools, petanques, games for children, tree climbing, the list is too long! Sanitary very clean ... attention to 3 restaurants ... dress dressed circumstantially. In van, it feels like a 2-seater Igloo tent next to an XL family tent"

We did not use the sanitary facilities because there was too much coming and going. Music from the promenade pubs until late at night. Waste water dump next to the campers, not great. Convenient for visiting Altea."

Very large place with many permanent campers mostly NL. Lots of picnic tables spread all over the place. Dogs are allowed, they are not allowed to go anywhere! Which is ok, but it is sometimes a long time to get outside. Only 1 exit."

We arrived late in the evening and unfortunately there was no room left, but we were allowed to spend the night just outside the campsite behind the reception. This way we could choose a place the next day (when campers left). The only downside is that the dog is not allowed to pee there, but this is also prohibited on the boulevard. Difficult.. for the rest great!"

It's in fantastic position for restaurants, hiking, Altea old town and of course a gorgeous beach. Probably different story in the summer, but for winter it's paradise. Yes only one point for shower and toilet, but hey after all the amazing restaurants around we did need that exercise"
6396,2542688,3,Chapito,05/01/2023,"The campsite has spacious pitches. The price for a night in a motorhome, 3 adults and a girl, with electricity, 37 euros. The bad thing is that they have only one bathroom area, if you get a plot far from these... a pain, it becomes difficult to go to the bathrooms. In winter all flamingos hibernate"

Right by the sea, nice playground(s) for kids on the campsite and also nearby, many good restaurants on the beautiful boulevard (also ideal with a pram). Plumbing is a bit older but very clean! Nice staff. We will stay for a while :-)"
6396,2498432,5,MMCfamily,17/11/2022,"Highly recommended! The area next to it was full and they sent us here and what a hit Super friendly staff Correct facilities and well priced with Acsi, next to the beach, bars and a good walk to the center."

Great location by the sea but annoying that staff had to plug & unplug the electricity but very pleasant staff. Bit tight exiting the site onto the main road but we managed
6396,2470720,3,pika31240,30/10/2022,Large Spanish-style campsite with 90% Dutch. Not unpleasant but not to our liking. Sanitary in large number and clean but quite old-fashioned. Very well placed next to the sea. On the other hand road next to it and quite noisy. Pleasant staff
6396,2454060,4,hiernard,20/10/2022,It's a seaside campsite with the qualities and faults of this type of campsite - decent pitches given the large number of places and very well maintained sanitary facilities with top-notch showers - pleasant welcome - negative point: road noise behind the camping wall
6396,2452676,3,Blancoventure1,20/10/2022,"It’s all about the location, otherwise you’d probably drive straight back out. A huge campsite that is very busy with one toilet block so if like us you were at the very far corner you better plan your toilet visit in advance. Bars and restaurants right outside the campsite which are good."
6396,2433732,4,oli.mr,09/10/2022,"We stayed in August 2022. The pitches are very well sized and shaded. Clean bathrooms. The best thing about the campsite is its location on the beachfront but it does not have any additional services within the campsite, no swimming pool, no bar, no supermarket, a shame because the campsite is very cool."
6396,2428336,3,SuusenHans,07/10/2022,"We can be brief about this; dutch village in spain! Good if you really can't drive any further, but that's about it. We were really surprised that such a thing really exists! Nice sanitary facilities and affordable considering the region."
6396,2375709,3,julielkmoore,16/09/2022,So I have been following this site for 2 years and was so disappointed when we arrived ! Very big and busy as expected but no segregation between pitches. As lots are long stays everywhere looks dirty and dusty. Great location for beach and lots of bars and restaurants.

6396,2308267,5,flowsnyder,27/08/2022,"Good value for money. Is right on the pebble beach. The sun dispensers at the pitches were also sorely needed... the walk to Altera was too long for us with 3 kids. But the boardwalk was quite nice. In the pizzaria ""las tavernas"" next door you can eat good pizza. Or pick some up and eat at the seat."

6396,1823819,4,mariova,15/04/2022,"We do not give it a 5 due to the absence of a pool and price in high season (€39/night). We stayed one night and, thanks to the Acsi, it was €20. Point to improve would be the gray water emptying area. As positive points: large plots, clean facilities, friendly staff and location on the seafront."

6396,1735497,4,Seseliyo,16/01/2022,"A giant campsite that looks like a city, rather it seems that you are in the Netherlands, 95% of the people are Dutch and very friendly, yes hehe. Good facilities with many water refill points. The only bad thing is that the large plots are occupied all year round. 10 min walk to Altea along the beach promenade"
6396,1727486,4,KimvanLeur,06/01/2022,"Great campsite! Staff very friendly, nice and close to the beach, great places, sanitary facilities sufficient but outdated, within walking distance of various shops and supermarkets. We had nice days, only after 2100km it really seemed as if we had just ended up in another province of the Netherlands ;-)"

The campsite is very clean and on the beach. The only but is that there is only one building with bathrooms and showers and it depends where, it is very far. The pitches are quite large and it is very quiet."

6396,1697050,4,mcFlyby,24/11/2021,€25 off season for motor home with two people and electricity. Quite dear compared to other sites we have stayed. Very cramped site completely on top of each other but a great location.
6396,1685305,4,g1nga_uk,11/11/2021,"Myself & the wife stayed here for 3 nights in our campervan. A great site with friendly staff. The toilets & showers are clean & adequate. The morning intensive cleaning time is 10am-11am which is strange as the showers are out of use during this busy period. Overall a nice stay, although the pitches are quite close together, but we would definitely stay here again."
6396,1657458,3,Mariska07,22/10/2021,"A particularly interesting campsite for its very good location in Altea. Simple but clean sanitary facilities. (1 building only). Washing machines that must be reserved in advance, a little restrictive. Pitches of different sizes on gravel, some near the road (wall). Very full in October, mainly Dutch occupancy, 20 € per night for 2 with the ADAC or ACSI card"
6396,1640899,2,lulu2727,12/10/2021,"Poor service and standards - would not go again, which is a shame as the location was great! No assistance in finding a plot despite the camp being 99% full - rubbish service! No soap in the toilets despite Covid and only one facility block in the whole camp located at one end - so miles to walk if your at the wrong end - hence load of cyclist whizzing around!"

6396,1465803,2,park4nightmariager,16/08/2021,"Well pitches, with shade. The worst was the treatment received by the night watchman PASCUAL, at 00:02 he did not want to let us pass with the car, he treated us fatally and made reference to a poster in which the supposed closing time was at 00:00 (he put a 01: 00h). I explained that her partner had told me that you could enter between 00: 00-00: 30h without a problem, and she told me THAT IT WAS NOT HER PROBLEM."

6396,1271370,1,Kai270,22/06/2021,"The worst place in my life. Everything full of cockroaches (and not the little ones) and there is not even toilet paper. sorry for that, 20 € with ADAC card are too much."

There are free places, quiet during the week, a little louder on the week when the permanent campers come. Currently top prices. We were 14 days in July / August (without electricity), it cost € 16.80 per night. Hot showers, everything clean."
6396,756682,4,Schumi1407,25/12/2019,"The place is perfectly located. Unfortunately, there are a lot of permanent campers and therefore only a few places left. When I arrived there were just 2 very tight spaces. My motorhome just fit there. Many restaurants in the surrounding area. At night it got very loud a few times, through (apparently drunk) teenagers on the street. Should I be around again, I will certainly try to get a seat again. (Maybe reserve early enough.)"
6396,730649,3,schmib5,26/10/2019,Good location at the seaside and relatively quiet if you do not stay near the back road. Places generally very narrow and not easy to maneuver. Camping under Dutch control with a large community of retirees from this country who camp at the year.

In this campsite they allowed us to stay until after lunch, we left at 5:00 pm, very nice the receptionist woman, the blonde and almost beautiful girl was a little edge. PS: something important to note is that they worry about having shade in almost all the plots apart from trees with special fabrics. Thank you, if it is nice to go to camping and with non-abusive prices, did not reach € 25 per night with electricity, two people and motorhome. We stayed three nights and we will repeat. Perhaps something bad to highlight is the emptying of gray water, is not well done having to go up the sidewalk to center the drain valve that I have in the back center of my AC."
6398,3261783,5,Lusterbon,05/09/2023,"We were here for 2.5 weeks and completely satisfied. I have never seen the cleaning staff as often as here. The night watchman takes care of any disturbances. It's just a shame that the bridge to the beach collapsed. And one or two guests don't keep their dogs on a leash, or some people think it's okay to dispose of their gnawed melon peels in the bushes"

Huge beach outside. 45€ night in July for RV but the same to extend your stay for a few hours which we thought was not correct as the campsite is half empty and does not need that expensive policy… Restaurant pachamama and others near by.

6398,2577671,2,JacobKl,14/02/2023,"The campsite is surrounded by swamp, so there were mosquitoes even at the end of January. Access to the beach was not possible with children because the river or tidal creek between land and beach was too deep and wide. Some of the pitches are really narrow, but there are also wider ones. If you only stay for a short time, it is also above average expensive."
6398,2560213,2,Mqndq,25/01/2023,32 euros for 1 night with a 5 meter camper!? much too expensive.
6398,2552968,5,Candra,16/01/2023,"We arrived shortly after dark and were greeted with a slightly raised eyebrow (overall, the staff are sometimes a bit grumpy but ok). Nevertheless: the facility, the cleanliness, the beach & the other campers more than made up for it. Priced in the upper range but the area was really super clean. We even extended by one night"

An 8m motorhome plus one person and 5A electricity costs a cheap 20€ if you stay for several days. Otherwise 22€ (off-season prices). Unfortunately, the floor is very sandy everywhere. Electricity is switched on/off by an employee. Everyone is nice and helpful. The restaurant has paella, pizza and salad."

6398,2497383,2,BeateundThomas,16/11/2022,"For 35 € a night for 2 adults with a camper and dog very expensive. The sanitary facilities are getting old and apparently nothing is being repaired. Hot water in the showers is probably a matter of luck. A plus, it was clean. Otherwise I would not visit this place again. Even the beautiful beach location can't change that. Pity"
6398,2485737,3,Walter676,06/11/2022,"The location on the beach is perfect for kite surfing and the site is a meeting place for all Morocco camping groups... in that respect the site seems to be a goldmine, especially since no money is obviously invested.

6398,2466943,3,traveltelly,28/10/2022,The campsite is good and very close to the beach. Perfect for kitesurfers.  The owner on the reception is not friendly at all. If you don’t wear your bracelet (I had it just with me) he gets angry. Doesn’t feel welcoming at all. Thats why I left one day early.

6398,2397064,1,nurmalweg,23/09/2022,"Half the place was free - we were told the place was full, checked the next day... almost everything was still free.

6398,2325613,2,DrCoconut,31/08/2022,"Unfortunately not a lot of choice if you want to kite in Tarifa, place seems a bit run down, sanitary facilities can be expanded, showers without any privacy protection worth mentioning. You can choose your own spot, but watch out for the trees. Birds nested there at the end of August (nature reserve). They were relatively loud and crapped on everything(!)."
6398,2323843,3,julesixo,31/08/2022,"Were there one night. Really nice location on the beach. However, we had chosen a shady spot and the entire car was shitted over by pigeons. Rather choose less shade. Sanitary facilities are really okay and reasonably clean. Unfortunately, the way into town is not really safe, along an unlit expressway. Paid 33 euros for van and 2 people without electricity (5€)."
6398,2281289,1,y0av,21/08/2022,"a rude owner. tiny pitchs, very expensive."
6398,2268096,5,Tatarin,19/08/2022,Great place to relax with family. Definitely recommend
6398,2220790,3,park4nightDaida,12/08/2022,"It has all the services, it is very close to the beach and with its private entrance, with trees for shade in the middle of a protected area for animals, but cleanliness is not its forte. The treatment is friendly and cordial. But we did not like that they allow many parties in the booth areas."
6398,2196828,3,samuel12332321,08/08/2022,"The location is good and there are a lot of places. Unfortunately, considering the sanitary facilities, the price is quite high. Overall the facility is very dated and the toilets are not clean! Tarifa can be reached by taxi for around €10 or an hour's walk. There are also a lot of birds in the trees."
6398,2191339,3,cilabela,07/08/2022,"The campsite has direct access to the beach and you can walk to town, a walk. On the contrary, the facilities are very poor and there is a lot of noise at night. Correct price. No pool. More suitable for young people than for families."
6398,2126947,5,Speci,26/07/2022,Fantastic CP in the southernmost part of continental Europe. Be sure to visit the adjoining bar with its open fireplace and Moorish-style furnishings. Absolutely the best place of our trip to Spain in March.
6398,2104593,1,Dags82,22/07/2022,"47 euro for campervan, 3 adults and 1 child. But on return no swimming pool, beach in windy day only usable for serfers, toilets in dramatic state in the evening. Next campings in much better shape in similar cost"
6398,2104588,1,looxon,22/07/2022,"Extremely dirty sanitaries. No swimming pool. Great beach but only for kite surfers. Impossible to swim in windy days. Very loudly. We escaped after first night. If you are not a kite surfer, Avoid !"
6398,2011121,4,BerndRudde,26/06/2022,"Very nice place, great location, and if you manage to get the showers warm, you get the 5th star! 27 € for 1 mobile home/ 2 pers. or electricity"
6398,2002452,2,Mipark4,23/06/2022,"it's a shame. the campsite and the place are wonderful, but there is a problem with the shower that I can not understand ... It would be 5⭐ with a small investment to fix the problem of the shower."
6398,1943444,4,FridaJanz,03/06/2022,"We spontaneously stayed 5 nights. In the right part of the square less busy (but you can hear the street a bit). Yes, the space is actually quite expensive for the facilities. Times for warm water are strange, (cold between 11 and 18.00) and somehow not in all showers... But we liked it very much :-) Location on the beach, close to Tarifa, good restaurant across the street."
6398,1942596,3,reschima,03/06/2022,"Directly at the sea. In the city of Tarifa only five minutes by car/taxi (10€). You can watch the kite surfers on the beach. Pitches very narrow. Sanitary facilities in order, it is only cleaned once a day and you can tell (toilet paper and soap are often empty, relatively dirty). Hot water only at certain times of the day. For the price of just under €27/night you can expect more."
6398,1918777,4,RBVV,26/05/2022,"Friendly staff. Narrow pitches, but in May enough choice for wider pitches. Sanitary neat and clean, low doors in the shower and toilet area. You can walk up to the stand from the campsite."
6398,1914620,5,beronichella,25/05/2022,"Camping with really friendly and accommodating staff, direct access to the beach and Tarifa is 4 mins by car. It’s also well connected to Playa de Bolonia. All services are well functioning, we had overall a lovely stay!"
6398,1912975,4,joke64,24/05/2022,"We paid 25.00 euros for 1 night, for 2 people, camper van, 1 dog and electricity. WiFi is free and works well but only works at the restaurant. Plumbing looks good and clean. And the beach, about 3 minutes away from my bed."
6398,1878998,5,Annaschempp,09/05/2022,"Really very nice and well-kept place! Sanitary very clean, staff very friendly! A bit more expensive. We were still completely satisfied and had even extended."
6398,1840569,5,Alienor1976,20/04/2022,"A wonderful place to relax. A short walk leads to the beautiful beach ideal for kite surfing. The campsite is very green, clean and well maintained. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The other campers are all very friendly, relaxed and chilled. Then it got full. I only wanted to stay 2 days and ended up staying over 2 weeks."
6398,1837568,3,squakypanda,19/04/2022,"Neat campsite, close to the beach with a friendly owner. A bit expensive for a tight spot. We have enjoyed ourselves there."
6398,1836016,3,AntonioBV,18/04/2022,"Well located, small and quiet especially for children. Direct access to the beach. On the other hand, perhaps a little expensive, the showers work quite poorly and most places are narrow, it does not allow you to remove the side awning, etc..."
6398,1825042,1,Papyphigy,15/04/2022,"Very expensive, the most expensive of the trip with the smallest place, barely enough to open its front door. view the photo."
6398,1816751,5,KNAUSi_2,12/04/2022,"good place with hardworking caretaker. familiar, tidy and clean. if the beach is impassable, the footpath leads to Tarifa to the Cepsa on the path next to the road, then turn right at the big tree, after about 50 m turn left across the pasture. at the end then a good wooden path with a bridge over Rio Jara. it is currently closed, but everyone is still cautious when crossing it."
6398,1776863,5,BlackPearl2020,07/03/2022,"Great location! Very quiet! We stood in the first row for 2 nights, the kite surfers right in front of us. The sanitary facilities are a bit dated (the shower stalls with saloon doors), but very clean and completely in order! On the beach, walk 4.5 km to Tarifa (note the tides, otherwise the way back could be difficult). We felt very comfortable."
6398,1746593,4,reisender06,03/02/2022,Great location. Very good equipment. Not brand new anymore. 26 euros per night in winter is expensive.
6398,1741808,2,VANLIFEPIA,26/01/2022,"Nice employees, but that’s all. Really expensive (€30 a night for 2 adults, CC and a dog), terrible showers (hot, cold, all mixed up). Campers didn’t seem too nice either. Not again!!"

6398,1716446,4,mara66,27/12/2021,"Very friendly welcome. € 26.60 for a motorhome with electricity, 2 adults. The pitches are indeed a bit small but that's not a problem for us in this season."
6398,1700860,2,Aituki,30/11/2021,"Pitches of different sizes, some with good views of the beach. Soil plots, dirt, which is a bit dirty, they could put some grass. Expensive for the facilities. Private access to the beach, very comfortable if you are going to kite, the only bad thing is that the tap at the entrance of the campsite, is supposed to sweeten the material, did not work. Regular hot water showers. pet supplement"
6398,1688219,1,DennisDulko,14/11/2021,Dirty and too expensive a shame

6398,1660863,3,Ladde,24/10/2021,"Camping site right at the kite spot. Unfortunately a bit old, but not too expensive in the off-season."
6398,1652084,3,pticlod,19/10/2021,Much too expensive compared to the services offered. very clean. small pitches without a separation hedge.
6398,1648173,3,Carlaaaaaa,16/10/2021,"Camping with very old facilities, nothing out of place."
6398,1646263,2,HansEngl,15/10/2021,"This campsite is way too expensive for its service. The planned water supply on the squares is turned off. The showers and toilets are completely out of date. The pitches are just dirt and sand. The beach, only kite sailors. I am not coming back."
6398,1642707,4,migchegger,13/10/2021,"Great location for kiting, right on the Spott (or a few 100m to do courses). Places small, right on the beach, quiet. Sanitary facilities clean, supermarket is not good for much. Reception staff listless. Entrance after midnight, as security at the entrance. For 2 adults & campers & electricity € 26.60 / d. There were enough free places in October. Overall, pleasant, relaxed atmosphere."
6398,1639247,4,FrauHansen,11/10/2021,Very nice. Surfers pott. Nice location right on the beach. Lots of places with shade. Showers ok. Plenty of space now in early October.
6398,1521256,4,Albaratada,27/08/2021,We spent three nights very comfortable. The bathrooms are very clean and most of the workers are very friendly. It has a cafe bar and a shop with basic things that can be useful. Also direct beach access. The town is 10 minutes away and several coves and beaches are very close on foot or by car. The only downside would be that it could be cheaper compared to others.
6398,1506409,5,ricard1978,24/08/2021,"Great, perfect for Kitesurfing"

6398,1371553,4,tickytour,27/07/2021,"Paid €30 per night unpowered. Nice campsite with direct access to kite beach, although, a long walk. We had a site with a beautiful view. Showers were fabulous in the ladies area. Bring your own toilet paper. Birds love it there too so watch the mess on your car…."
6398,1355198,1,perala,23/07/2021,"Very expensive, 43 eur for Camper, 2 adults and 2 children, with these facilities, without a pool, I would pay half. An armed robbery, like all Tarifa. We go where they want us ..."
6398,1294232,2,SebenLIS,03/07/2021,"The place is suitable for exploring Tarifa. The cleanliness of the sanitary facilities leaves a lot to be desired, the supermarket does not offer a usable range and in the ""restaurant"" there is frozen pizza (2 pieces 16 €). There is a youth camp on the square, so it can get louder. The beach is spacious and can be reached directly from the campsite. There is a maximum of 2 stars for the location. I would definitely not go there again."
6398,1289661,4,loretomey,01/07/2021,Very close to the beach. Quiet and clean. € 7 plot plus € 10 each adult. Paste: hot water at certain times otherwise all good.
6398,1282782,4,sueceja,28/06/2021,Fantastic place to stay with a motorhome close to all restaurants close to Chiringuitos on the beach you walk out of your motorhome and you’re already on the beach windy but that does not bother us and the spaces are on the small side that’s the only downside of this motorhome park.
6398,1261353,1,Mitsou,18/06/2021,Price 31.50 one night 2 pers. Far from being ideal. Dirty. Photos can be given for proof. Home limit. Dangerous road to go to tarifa. It is not the most serious. The campsite gives us the feeling of non-respect for the customer. Are some of the opinions real? In any case we will never recommend this place
6398,1256780,4,JMVanIchi,15/06/2021,"We go frequently. € 24 Mini Camper (without light). Good vibes, beach two steps away very for kite, super cool river with bird passages, clean services, small and expensive shop. Negative note: harsh decoration hehehe. Even a ""graffiti"" of a picador torturing a defenseless bull. But the site is really cool."
6398,1206806,5,MaligaTourBelgique,19/05/2021,"Top camping !!! On the edge of a nature reserve and the beach, quiet, clean toilets. Ideal as a kitesurf spot! We highly recommend !!!"

WiFi only at the bar at the entrance. Toilets / showers clean, but water temperature difficult to adjust. Therefore, 25 euros / night for 2 people with electricity, too expensive."
6398,1157896,5,Carlos1009,26/03/2021,"I recommend. I was a week ago and super quiet, clean and very friendly staff. Private entrance to the beach. Large laundry rooms (there is a dryer and washing machine), bathrooms and showers. 25 euros per night with electricity, caravan and two people. They let us put the car in the adjoining lot."

6398,1130138,5,choroni03,12/01/2021,"A nice and quiet place with direct access to the beach a bit away from the street. The plots are actually very narrow, but in the off-season there is enough space to evade. The reception was very nice, the space and the sanitary facilities are very well maintained. Hot showers (24/7), electricity and all camper services included, we paid 23 € / night for 2 people. That’s absolutely ok."
6398,1116964,4,julietmarsh2,22/11/2020,"Quirky site. Many very small pitches but larger available.

Right on beach
€23 a night"

6398,895083,1,Camperoespanol,24/07/2020,By far one of the worst I’ve been to in Europe.
6398,777871,4,hwneumann,08/02/2020,"Quite OK, and in contrast to other places not so overpriced: I only paid 15.50 EU / night including electricity with my WoMo. Otherwise, everything is there: hot showers at no extra cost, all cleaning and supply facilities, a small grocery store, a bar, not exactly new, but neat and clean sanitary facilities."
6398,771467,2,Europetravelor64,22/01/2020,"Relatively outdated sanitary facilities, but clean. Relatively expensive for the services provided (€ 23 for one night and 2 people including electricity)"

6398,753070,3,Hellenbroich,12/12/2019,Price for the ailing sanitary facilities not justified. We only used it for transit to Morocco. Would not otherwise go to the place. Supply well to start on the square.

this Tarifa campings needs to lower their prices... no wonder by they are almost empty..."
6398,726383,3,volga44,20/10/2019,"Admittedly, the campsite is ideally located for the kite and board spot, but without interest for the simple visitors that we were. Reception at least at the reception, calibration of seats on the shoehorn, dangerous road to reach the center by bike (possible by the beach), hot water available but with limited hours. Note, however, an efficient and accommodating field staff."
6398,634114,3,rilop,16/08/2019,"After looking for a vacancy in at least 10 campsites in the area until we reached this area, we found an oasis in the middle of nowhere to find vacancies in August ... But the supermarket with exorbitant prices and nothing fresh and the super unfriendly staff, It left us a bittersweet taste."
6398,535838,1,bexhead,02/07/2019,"The place is getting old, the sanitary facilities are very dirty, hot water there is only between 8 to 11 and 18 to 23 hours. In addition, the showers consist of a knob for water (the temperature is always given) and a nozzle on the ceiling, here the cabins are protected up to 1.30. The toilets are shabby, the doors only up to 1.69 high, so that one can be observed in the toilet by larger people. The plots are big enough, but not protected view, in itself the place is overpriced."

6399,3204574,4,cbvima,23/08/2023,"Very careful campsite! Large pool, clean toilets all the necessary services! The only drawback, the beach is not very good as it is just behind the port. Two nights with light and two people €98."
6399,3142644,1,IreneMurasita,14/08/2023,"Very expensive camping, €83 per night, the motorhome, two adults and two children aged 3 and 6 with electricity. The campsite in general is fine, it is large, spacious, it has two very clean pools and everything is fine, but the price is excessive. There are many flies and mosquitoes. We won't be back. In August they had many free places, there is no one who pays those prices"
6399,3125544,1,CristelBurgt,11/08/2023,"Crowded, noisy in the evening and very expensive. 75 euros for 2 people and 1 child with electricity is very expensive if you have to queue for 45 minutes for the shower."

6399,3023393,2,g52vesar,26/07/2023,"We went to spend a day with the children, €98 with the motorhome, a lot of dust and noise from outside the campsite. The service areas about 300 m from the plot, once in them, clean and functional. The pool is quite good and the beach is a 2-minute walk away. The treatment of the cordial staff, but zero flexibility (more considering the price per day!). Unfortunately, we won't be back."

So I paid the 50% again. Afterwards I saw that the first payment had gone through. On arrival they said that I had made 2 reservations and therefore had to pay for 2 plots. In the end, only for 1 plot, but a lot of annoyance!"

6399,2772894,3,vanlife1409,21/05/2023,Clean but desolate. Van parking is like a parking lot. No demarcation to the neighbors. Good location.
6399,2765271,5,Mittelberg,19/05/2023,Super nice staff. Very well-kept facility. Very clean sanitary facilities. I can only recommend the place.
6399,2751771,4,patriciasab,15/05/2023,"Campsite near the beach. The places are small and a lot of opposite. Toilets, showers very clean. Small supermarket, restaurant next door. Pleasant welcome and speaking French"
6399,2750418,4,ecostt,14/05/2023,"Basically, we find the space very nice, trees, right on the beach, well-stocked supermarket (e.g. also bread on Sundays), spacious and clean toilet facilities, very friendly and helpful staff - big drawback: Sat / Sun and public holidays massive noise pollution from beach clubs tw to 3 :00 a.m. (depending on the wind, but extremely loud throughout the site with the mostly prevailing south/west wind)"
6399,2739334,2,mowogra,10/05/2023,"Unfortunately, places are allocated and the front part of the facility - similar to a parking lot - is filled up. The rear area is nice, for more than 7m mobile homes the pitches are sometimes too small and more expensive."
6399,2731040,1,harald.schuetz,07/05/2023,"wanted to empty our toilet on the way through (also for a fee), brusquely refused ""we don't give it to us!"". Too bad, the service could have been."
6399,2727541,5,BduS,06/05/2023,An excellent and well organized campsite. The pitches are spacious. The sanitary facilities are modern and clean. Helpful and active staff. Restaurant Hippi is great! There is a small supermarket. Beach at 200 meters. With ACSI everything is incl. €23 p/n. The ferry to Cadiz is 2 km away. Dogs are not allowed. But in Cádiz there are a few parking spaces where you can also park your camper/van. Cycling=22km.
6399,2725549,5,we2,05/05/2023,"We thought long and hard about going to this place because of the bad reviews. Conclusion: The entrance is actually limited to 3.3m, but a gate was opened for us immediately in the parking lot next door through which any vehicle can come. Place is beautifully located, great beach, 1a sanitary and nice staff, well stocked supermarket, place super clean. Pool was closed."
6399,2709101,1,vantrotters360,30/04/2023,"74€ for one night with a van for 2 adults and 2 children without electricity. High season rate but pool closed! Crockery cold water, music from the restaurant until midnight and car from 8 am. slept very badly..."
6399,2700681,5,crisodry,27/04/2023,"I recommend it, a very good place to spend a few days off, you have the beach nearby and the HIPPIE restaurant is very good."
6399,2697922,5,Movens,26/04/2023,"we travel with VW bus 2 pers. & border collie. We stayed here during the week end of April 23. Little going on, space was assigned to us, but we were still able to move (WoMo with cats next to us). we recommend standing in the northern part if possible. Nice places, but sandy, volume v. Sports ground. it's OK. shade available. We could go to the sea with our dog in the morning. Price 20€ per night"
6399,2695466,3,meguu,25/04/2023,We’ve been there in the easter week so the camp was completely full! The location and the facilities are good but its very expensive and doesn’t offer nothing special (53€/night motorhome+2 adults +2 kids under 3y). And note that the swimming pool was closed. Good supermarket.
6399,2695218,5,VanlifersOnTour,25/04/2023,"This campsite clearly deserves 5 stars. Well placed, well ordered, impeccably clean toilets, perfect emptying, very friendly staff (who even agreed to receive a package for us well before our arrival). Really incomprehensible reviews for us. 5 stars without question."
6399,2693176,4,BoxerRanch,24/04/2023,"Very nice campsite with pine and other trees. The sanitary facilities are very clean and spacious. Nice little supermarket with a decent selection. Although more than 50% of the parking spaces were free, we were assigned a space with our VW bus. Therefore no five stars. Motorbike noise could be heard into the night on Sunday evening. It is possible that this was an exception."
6399,2691690,5,Romy1306,23/04/2023,"Great campsite with brilliant spotless facilities. Very close to the beaches and to the town it’s a 20 minute walk. Worth the €23 pn with Acsi!!!!
At weekends from Friday to Sunday you will hear loud music coming from the nightclubs in puerto sherry more than a km away; music stops at 2345.
Also there is noise coming from the nearby sports fields .
This did not bother us!!!"
6399,2683373,4,Appetute,20/04/2023,"Beautifully located CP, very clean, almost new sanitary, good shop, only 10 minutes to the ferry terminal to Cadiz, the front seats are already affected by the volume of the training on the adjacent soccer fields, very friendly, English-speaking reception, lots of space, beach very close (only across the street), ACSI card accepted"
6399,2678924,5,ardechois26,18/04/2023,"Everything is perfect . A pleasant and smiling welcome, shaded pitches, polite staff and exemplary sanitary facilities. A bar restaurant and an adjoining supermarket. The beach is 50 m away. This campsite is a model of its kind. Price: 20€ for a van, 2 people and a dog. Cheer"
6399,2676157,4,Sbfa,17/04/2023,"It seems like a great campsite, a great location next to the beach and a wonderful pine forest. It has a supermarket and restaurant and the rest of the services for our motorhome. The light is a bit expensive, €8, but I didn't need it. Very quiet place. Walking you can go along the Maritime Avenue that there are several beach bars as well as on the beach. To repeat"
6399,2673654,3,lebronjames2306,16/04/2023,"With acsi you seemed to get a secondary seat, although there was a lot of vacancy. At the weekend the ferry runs only 4 times. For us it was unfavorable for a visit to Cadiz. We drove into the city and then were free shortly before Cadiz."
6399,2672282,1,DingirCZ,15/04/2023,"One of the worst campsites we've been to.  There is only one sink for gray water in the entire area and only two sinks for the toilet!!  You have no privacy at the parking place, because the places are not separated by a fence.  Terrible place!!!!  Never more!"
6399,2667812,5,CNS33,13/04/2023,Very pleasant staff price 28€ per night for 2 in a van with electricity clean sanitary facilities beach in front of the campsite
6399,2665189,4,AdriaOsel,12/04/2023,"We stayed two nights and were very happy with the service, hot showers and hot water for washing dishes although not at all sinks. daily Cleaning the sanitary facilities, so everything is fine. We found €56 for 2 people, electricity and campers to be comparatively reasonable. Close to town and a very nice wide sandy beach just opposite, therefore a great location."
6399,2653280,4,tivella,09/04/2023,"Good campsite but very expensive. €54 per night for a 2-person electric van. there is an emptying AND filling point at the top of the tarmac driveway. For Cadiz, turn LEFT when leaving the campsite. Marine station. 2km away and train 1.2km away. For us, boat on strike so we took the train and it's perfect! less than €15 AR for 2 with free scooters or bikes. 4* only for the price"
6399,2643280,5,inakiana,06/04/2023,"Good campsite, very large and clean and good service, far from the center, half an hour to go to Cádiz by catamaran. Excellent services and bathrooms and many"
6399,2642083,1,kondomanolio,05/04/2023,"They charged us on the Sunday before Easter €36 per night per motorhome and two people without electricity! with light it would be 49! The most expensive camping I have ever paid for and not the best. They don't let you use discount cards these days, ole you! to abuse that is S. Santa! the pool closed... but they charge you as if it were a Spa. Plot without grass and without privacy. The good thing, the supermarket and the kittens that were there."
6399,2641552,2,N444NNW,05/04/2023,I’ve been fobbed off re booking as it was Semana Santa week and told it was so busy to turn up and hope that they could accommodate us. I was nervous that we’d be stuck in a heaving town with no where to even park up let alone camp. Got here by 11 am. Loads of spaces. They tried to put us in a dark tiny spot by the services at €49 . EHU is €10 !! Walked around and found a big empty space. That’ll be €55. Decided to go for that and look around now that we are here. There are loads of P4 night free and empty here. Off tomorrow. They are real money spinners.
6399,2622822,4,Christophedouet,24/03/2023,Good welcome and very good day to take the boat to visit Cadiz... New pitches on returning a little far from water and sanitary facilities but correct. Nice campsite.
6399,2621201,5,gertlohse,23/03/2023,"Very large campsite with many pitches. The pitches in the dune landscape are great, but fortunately not suitable for very large mobile homes... Sanitary facilities on this site are like new with warm water. We paid 28 euros for 2 people and Womo."
6399,2619856,4,Firo,22/03/2023,"Huge lovely site right next to beach. Good facilities my only complaint is the pitches are a sand/ clay mud combination and with 2 dogs my van was filthy. put mats outside, but then they were covered with the mess!
Needs some stones put down"
6399,2609151,5,Leslobs3,14/03/2023,"Very good campsite, pleasant welcome, good-sized pitches. Showers with hot water and good flow. Very convenient drain. 2kms on foot to take the boat to Cadiz. El Puerto de Santa María, a town that also deserves to be visited. We stayed 5 nights and will be back"
6399,2593113,2,jotseca,27/02/2023,"So-so experience. Wi-Fi that connects but does not work, showers in which the water cannot be regulated (unforgivable) Regular signage, all very distant. Very strict cancellation or reservation modification policy. To take public transport you have to walk at least 20 min. On the positive side, it has activities for children and the bathrooms are clean. Very close to the beach."
6399,2592530,1,Yliana,27/02/2023,"Massive camping, the plots are with stones or full of mud. Do not try to bathe in the services because there is no flow of water for everyone. Most likely you will have to dress with the soap on the body. Unforgivable. Wi-Fi doesn't work. In the 20 days that we were here, nothing changed. We notified the reception, but I doubt that they have paid attention to us. It is a camping not recommended."
6399,2585344,4,Vandiamo,21/02/2023,"Great for larger motorhomes we are 8.7m although not all pitches gravelled, we were on Sand. €23 ACSI (not 22) Laundry €5 wash €3 dry but one was out of order which for a campsite of this size is not ideal but it was fixed next day. Black cassette emptying right next to water filling, not ideal as other people were emptying as we were filling with fresh water, very narrow too"
6399,2573315,4,Bernardher,10/02/2023,"We only stayed there for one night. Nice infrastructure, good laundry. On the other hand, there is no water point to connect directly to the motorhome. Everything must be done by container and a single point to discharge its gray water. It is a place to stay and not to pass through. Huge and practical."
6399,2563715,5,BrigitteMorgenstern,29/01/2023,"Nice place, don't arrive too late otherwise it will be tight. Everything you need. Price with ACSI in order otherwise too expensive."
6399,2558457,5,derAuge,23/01/2023,"In 01/2023 the pitch costs 23€/night with ACSI including electricity. the through pitches are very spacious, gravelled and also very straight."
6399,2556646,4,lvmb,21/01/2023,"beautiful campsite, well placed. Go to Cadiz via the catamaran or the bus, tickets at the same place about 2 km away (you only have to walk along the water to reach the starting point)."
6399,2555133,3,mfdroop,18/01/2023,"should be better for the price (motorhome less than 6m, one person, electricity = 28€/day, this was in December 2022 and in January 2023). Wifi good signal but no way to connect. If several people are taking showers at the same time, it is only the first one which gets enough water pressure. The others, only a few drops. I find it a pity as the camping  has more than enough and attentive stuff."
6399,2551327,3,begur,14/01/2023,"without acsi 28€ in low season. Absolutely over the top and not worth Wed should join the other vans right by the port. Free, great view...but no service."
6399,2542479,3,keizpetan,05/01/2023,"Neat campsite. Opposite the beach. Catamaran to go to Cadiz, 15 minutes walk from the campsite. That way you don't have to move the van to visit the capital."
6399,2533729,4,agravia,30/12/2022,Nice campsite with friendly staff. Showers not adjustable in temperature and regular WiFi but as in any campsite. Level plots that could be more intimate. Next to some beautiful wooded dunes. The catamaran to Cádiz is a point in its favor. Good option to visit the area and recharge energy.
6399,2533248,5,kk1,30/12/2022,"camping next to the beach, 22eur with acsi card per night, a boat leaves in the town towards Cádiz"
6399,2530710,2,camperinogino,28/12/2022,campsite is not bad services are good the price of €21 paid for a night without electricity could also be fine. unfortunately they fooled us with the possibility of having wi-fi They are aware that wi-fi does not work. for this I give you two stars.
6399,2523602,5,captaindakota,18/12/2022,"Great site and lots to see nearby, tight access buy perfectly ok, there is a bridge over the entrance which is 3.3m …. However … there is a second entrance just near by and this can be used - however i was ok. But i asked the question as i was close and there was something bigger. Very well run site IMO and excellent facilities"
6399,2488600,4,LosJubilados,09/11/2022,"Very well located for visiting the city of Cadiz thanks to the bus for 2.80 euros, no ferry and close to the very typical town center of Santa Maria. Very clean toilets. Only downside, it rained and it's slush."
6399,2484635,3,ptrdbs,06/11/2022,"1 star for being open off season, 1 star for super nice lady at the reception, 1 star just to be fair, otherwise the most expensive campsite we were in Spain, nothing special for money they are asking…."
6399,2478478,5,Marvin86,02/11/2022,"Good camping, next to the beach. Very friendly staff. Everything very clean. I recommend it."
6399,2476325,3,Matt-Mat,01/11/2022,"see clean beautiful campsite. Sanitary facilities, washing machine and dryer were great. We stayed 3 nights (17-20.10.2022). 3 minutes to the mini market, 5 minutes to the beach. No problem to Cadiz, for little money by bus or ferry. 8 a.m. wake up from the gardener or construction worker and in the evening after the last football game 10 p.m. on the football pitch in front of it."
6399,2472877,4,Cbejlc67,30/10/2022,Large well-located campsite (a few dozen meters from the very beautiful beach of la puntilla). With beautiful places. The campsite allows the reception of large or even very large motorhomes (22€ in low season with the ACSI card instead of 35€ electricity included). Possibility to visit Cadiz from the campsite by taking the maritime shuttle for a few € round trip (20' walk on flat ground to the maritime station and 30' crossing). You can also get there by train or bus).
6399,2465045,5,Loocky,27/10/2022,"Ideal campsite. well located, clean, well appointed. very friendly staff. small store at the well stocked entrance. the pitches are big enough. very clean toilets. 30 minutes away you will find the boarding point to visit Cadiz by bus or boat. Do not miss. The only downside is the mosquitoes."
6399,2462856,3,pika31240,26/10/2022,Either nice clean campsite but a lot too big for us and next to a road. €32 per night for a van for 2 adults and 2 children.
6399,2459107,4,monicapark,23/10/2022,"Great campsite, beautiful and well organized. Right in front of a large beach and a nice promenade. To reach Cadiz you can use a connection by sea or by land but the stations are 30 minutes on foot ... for one night the requested rate is a bit high ... a few meters away there is a large parking lot where you can stay trouble free!"
6399,2458012,4,WeegieWilly,23/10/2022,"Pitch situated under the Pine Trees, which was near the sports ground, so noisy until maybe 2200, but then quiet. This is a very small negative, as the motor home area was very busy. Mosquitos were an issue hence 4 stars. Sanitary facilities constantly being cleaned.
Lack of water points and the recycling / bins unclear. Great proximity to beach / Cadiz and cycling in the Parque Natural."
6399,2442946,5,fabder31,14/10/2022,Beautiful pitches. Campsite facing the beach. Plenty of clean toilets. Acsi price 22 euros with electricity. Boats for Cadiz 20 min walk away for 2.60 euros (if you can book the return as soon as you get off) and if necessary train a little further every 20 minutes for about 3.00. A good base for visiting Cadiz.
6399,2438393,4,evavinvi,11/10/2022,"There are two entrances, the main one is at 3:30 with the nasturtium we did not enter and with difficulty we backed up and they gave us control for another door. Terrible Wi-Fi. The plot full of beach land, like the park, the bathrooms are fine."
6399,2437692,5,tnzlc4,11/10/2022,"enough space for the van, nice staff, small shop with everything you need. The beach is a 5 minute walk from the campsite and is very nice (was a bit windy at that time :-)). Very clean showers/toilets and the service facilities including the washing machine were great. Quiet and beautiful campsite with nice travellers. Would come again."
6399,2436414,4,Moby67,10/10/2022,"Not the cheapest place but a great all round camp site with excellent pitches and shower, toilet and laundry services and MH services. Also has good shop and restaurant/bar. Close to lovely beaches and near to catamaran stop to get to Cadiz. Great area."
6399,2429558,1,Carolramgil,07/10/2022,"The places are spacious and the bathrooms are not bad, but it seems very expensive for what they offer. The showers cannot be regulated in temperature, you shower at the temperature that the maintenance person decides that day. Cádiz is very uncomfortable to get to and, as you get a square near the soccer fields, you will be listening to screams and balls all day"
6399,2410599,3,TingPi,29/09/2022,"Clean camping, laundry is very expensive. 
the pool was closed but we still needed to pay full amount..."
6399,2402299,5,lebeauserge,25/09/2022,Very nice campsite with a well-stocked supermarket at the entrance as well as a pleasant restaurant. 20 minutes by scooter to visit Cadiz. Beautiful.
6399,2390303,5,HikingThekla,21/09/2022,"We had a great quiet parking space, but further back away from the big square. We were taken to the square. The sanitary facilities were clean and well maintained, the staff was always friendly, top self-cleaning gray water disposal station, chemical toilets could be emptied at the sanitary facility, electricity on site. Supermarket on the square. Beach 5min walking distance!! Everything is great for us :)"
6399,2372234,3,BelenGea,14/09/2022,"We entered the campsite because it already accepted ACSI, €22 for two adults, plot and electricity, if it's not quite expensive. If you go for a few days they put you in an area without shade. To use the toilets for the disabled you have to leave a deposit of €20, which I don't know what sense it makes and I think it's an abuse."
6399,2369662,4,Heikeundbonnie,14/09/2022,"Great place, unfortunately no reasonable pictures here on the site"
6399,2368332,4,Heikeundbonnie,13/09/2022,"Super clean place, 20 minutes to the ferry port because unfortunately there was no ferry, we took the replacement bus to Cadiz for 3.40 euros, the ferry would have cost the same. Cadiz is worth seeing. Washrooms are super clean, the water is warm, very friendly staff. And it is quiet despite the fact that the place is on a street. The beach is also great. It is recommended"
6399,2360993,3,Xocasmadeira,11/09/2022,very expensive campsite 2 people and a camper €48. an unbearable dust.
6399,2357708,4,PhilAud63,10/09/2022,"positive points: - very well placed to visit cadiz by bus/boat - facing the sea - spacious location - very very clean - very friendly reception - access to services at the top negative points: - very bad WiFi - staff of the supermarket not friendly - non-adjustable shower temperature. if you want to take a cool shower, you have to use the outdoor showers, not cool!"
6399,2356089,2,ivblumf,09/09/2022,Wi-Fi is available but of little use as it is far too slow. Even opening simple websites didn't work. Place without charm and a bit cramped. a bit too expensive for that.
6399,2325595,4,DrCoconut,31/08/2022,"Large campsite with mostly well-kept sanitary facilities. If you are looking for something different than a series of identical boring plots, this is the place for you. The pitches are all a bit more individual, with well-placed trees for hammocks/clothes lines/etc. You just don't have a lot of choice in terms of parking space, you get one assigned. Price reasonable at the end of August."
6399,2261935,5,JeanAymeric,18/08/2022,"Very large campsite, shade, a giant swimming pool, the beach a stone's throw away, very clean sanitary facilities, friendly and always present staff. I don't really understand the bad reviews, admittedly the price is high (111€ 2 nights in a van for 4 with electricity) but that's the price on the Spanish south coast."
6399,2191301,3,cilabela,07/08/2022,"The campsite has a very good location and the facilities are well maintained. The motorhome pitches are correct, with few shadows. On the contrary the prices are too high. €30 per person and day (children the same), apart from the plot and electricity."
6399,2186863,1,josue79,06/08/2022,120 euros for spending the night in ac one night four people. We went to the chipiona area.
6399,2186638,1,scje01,06/08/2022,"Average, dusty not particularly nice campsite. 30 € per person for one night, makes 120 € for four people -> that's demolition on the grounds that a festival is currently taking place in the city."
6399,2167022,4,Rafikis,03/08/2022,"The campsite has good facilities and is in a very good situation. We were in one of the plots at the entrance, spacious, well shaded by eucalyptus trees and quiet, although there is passing traffic. The bathrooms are great, the giant pool, the super Eroski very good. The beach is an urban beach without much charm. Boat to Cádiz nearby (if you go with dogs, max 10kg and in a carrier)."
6399,2163200,1,FamillePen07,02/08/2022,"very very expensive in high season! We are August 2, I wanted to book for one night, 2 adults and 3 children with electricity at a cost of 64th!!!!! It abused! I preferred to leave and sleep by the beach."
6399,2143621,1,danielcajade,30/07/2022,"We were going to spend a week on vacation and were disappointed when we arrived. The squares full of earth, dust and ants. Dirty bathrooms not cleaned. Unfriendly staff. Having paid everything in advance and not taking away anyone's place since they had many vacancies, we decided to leave and they did not return the money. It's not what you see on your website. Not recommended at all."
6399,2038642,3,Astridida,04/07/2022,"The pitches are very narrow and delimited by small walls. Sanitary very clean. Campsite extremely noisy due to construction work in early July, long-term campers and weekend campers make loud music to disco from outside. Please note that electricity costs 9.60 euros, since everyone connects several devices. Van 1 person with electricity 30.30 euros per day. Most expensive place so far. Pitch was 20 minutes from the beach."
6399,2020675,3,ibansardi,29/06/2022,"good location and good facilities. inattentive staff. They had half an hour to assist us at reception upon arrival, one person doing cash for shift change and the other talking to two animation workers about their things. we just arrived for the check-in at 3 pm without eating. a nonsense very clean bathrooms"

6399,2002374,4,BerndRudde,23/06/2022,"Actually all right! Top sanitary facilities, but that's what you can expect at €29/day (1 mobile home, 2 people, without electricity). However, it is also a bit soulless and without atmosphere. The beach is just any beach. 30 minute walk to the ferry to Cadiz."
6399,1998588,3,scheina1605,21/06/2022,"Small pitches for such a big place. Sanitary facilities clean, but nothing special. We didn't use the pool. Perfect for going to Cadiz. Too expensive, 2 people, camper, electricity and dog €38.60/night."

6399,1942589,4,reschima,03/06/2022,"Clean tidy campsite. Clean sanitary facilities, very large, but the pitches were a bit uncomfortable (very narrow and not a nice atmosphere). Pool not yet operational. You can take the ferry to Cádiz."
6399,1939493,5,SaritaTamara,02/06/2022,"Very nice campsite. Clean sanitary area, generous space under shady trees. Very quiet, so you can hear the sound of the sea, where you can walk in 5 minutes. The pitches are not separated by hedges, which we thought was nice as it allowed the children to play in the empty adjacent space. I would come again."
6399,1935606,5,Chisa,31/05/2022,"Very large campsite with a shaded area and a sunny area. It's nice to use the cleaning toilets they have. We travel with a baby and leaving a deposit of €20 they give you a key to use an exclusive bathroom for babies, with a bathtub. It is on the beachfront and close to the port in case you want to visit Cádiz by boat."
6399,1900322,5,Rodacar,19/05/2022,"Very nice campsite, very welcoming and friendly staff, very good organization for placing vehicles. Clean toilets. Access to the sea, superb beach."
6399,1879216,4,pasthy67,09/05/2022,"only campsite near Cadiz, 44 euros for 2 nights without electricity. very clean and recent toilets. road to cross to be on the beach and 25 minutes walk from the pier for cadiz. perfect for 2 nights."
6399,1877373,1,dodogun,08/05/2022,09/2021 expensive .. dusty .. swimming pool closed .. convenience store closed … go your way
6399,1815563,1,Papyphigy,11/04/2022,"April, €29 for the pitch 9.20 for electricity, the most expensive of our trip and the least beautiful. Nothing to see in this town. I do not advise."
6399,1814135,1,Gerup,10/04/2022,"This campsite is the only one near Cadiz and is brazenly exploiting its monopoly. For 2 nights, 2 people and 1 camper under 6m we paid 77€. The electricity price alone was €18.40. Nobody in Spain had asked for that much in the last 3 weeks. The sanitary facilities are outdated but clean, the attached supermarket is well stocked and not overpriced."
6399,1808487,4,HaMoSprinterVan,06/04/2022,"Everything clean and well equipped, but little nature. Close to the beach, restaurants in the ferry and ferry to Cárdiz easily accessible. Camping rather close together, nothing special. The only thing to note is the entrance height of 3.5m. The supermarket on site is well stocked."
6399,1800509,3,MarikeWerges,29/03/2022,"Pitches unloving and quite narrow. If you stay for a short time, you will be assigned a place in the front area, nicer places would be in the other areas. Swimming pool at this time without water. Wash house clean and modern. washing machine expensive. Reception friendly and easy. Location to the beach great. With ACSI card 22 € including electricity very okay. Wifi connection bad"
6399,1793810,3,KlausBlau,24/03/2022,"Reception was very neutral. Parking space was assigned, was ok. Sanitary area clean and the technology worked. Mini market on CP was closed. Restaurant right on the CP not recommended (service, quality). Connection to Cadiz: 20 minutes on foot + 30 minutes by ferry was ok for us."
6399,1787864,3,jeanmaxlacroix,19/03/2022,"I confirm the comments of fredletaz, minimalist reception and yet I manage in Spanish. manage for the information. we stayed for two nights which is enough for us."
6399,1786298,4,Kwakaman,17/03/2022,"A good location for visiting Cadiz despite ferry terminal being a 25 minute walk from the campsite.
A nice restaurant by the entrance of the site and a couple more approximately 10 minutes away.
Facilities okay, nice and clean.
Some flooding due to heavy rain when we visited but didn't cause us any issues. Paid 22 euros per night with ACSI card."
6399,1783170,3,fredletaz,14/03/2022,"Huge rather factory campsite. Expensive €22 with ACSI plus €3 trailer. Very cold welcome, no tourist information. Clean and spacious toilets. Access to Cadiz by practical boat but still almost 2km. Possibility to embark with his bike."
6399,1783053,1,filodefero,14/03/2022,After a rainy night the pitches are flooded. Electricity cost exaggerated. 20 minutes on foot boarding x Cádiz.
6399,1777688,1,Nicover,08/03/2022,We went there on a Wednesday at the beginning of March and the only place we were offered was in a parking lot facing the garbage containers and along the road. All for the “modest” of 32 euros. We left and discovered a car park right next to it with an extraordinary view.
6399,1777282,1,Krouge,08/03/2022,Much too expensive 10 to 12 euros more than all the other campsites in Spain
6399,1775460,5,freeman1612,06/03/2022,"Highly Recommended. Not very cheap but 29 € for van + 2 people completely OK for this offer. Great location, very (very) clean sanitary facilities with great showers and family bathroom (perfect if you want to bathe babies), and the pitches also offer enough space to make yourself comfortable."
6399,1770231,4,CaliLiv,01/03/2022,"Stayed Feb 2022 (€57.80 for 2 nights with elec) Nice campsite, just a short walk from the town. The facilities were all well cleaned and plenty of them. The on-site restaurant/bar was very busy so just stayed for a drink, reasonably priced and nice cocktails.  The only negative would be the noisy football pitches and roads surrounding the site, the noise was fairly constant."
6399,1768320,3,JosyetChristian,27/02/2022,"This campsite is a big factory! You don't choose your location, and they're not all well-marked or well-placed. The toilets are good and clean. The staff doesn't always have time to listen, but individually these people are pleasant. The site is great, close to the sea, the maritime shuttle (when it works), close to shops."

Personally, I'm not a fan of campsites, but I'm sure there's nothing to complain about here. 23 euros for a vehicle and a person…. So far okay. Disposal is very clean and well organized."
6399,1748639,5,AnselmoVC,06/02/2022,Nice and neatly laid out campsite. Sanitary building was very clean...the staff was very friendly and helpful. Also recommended for a longer stay...
6399,1733558,3,Porterricks,14/01/2022,"CP as described basically neat. Various parking spaces with high stone surrounds, when it rains you need pallets for the camper. You then simply drunk. Some of the tall trees provide shade. The gravel roads cause a lot of dust in the wind. You have no free choice of parking space. Things are better elsewhere."
6399,1732467,3,Brilisad,12/01/2022,"A somewhat factory-built campsite, whether in the reception area, the pitches without privacy, clean sanitary facilities, and very practical emptying. High price out of season 28.90 € for 1 CC 2 Ad. Electricity. Pier or bus for cadiz at 1.3km, 2.80 € per person / way"
6399,1729222,3,pere57,07/01/2022,"The first category will be only for the impeccable bathrooms. The rest without any service now in the winter. The plots with mud and sand, bring the sand inside the cabin. It's not cheap. Access to the ferry to Cádiz 30mn walk."

6399,1714167,5,LotteGehnen,22/12/2021,"Good campsite near the beach. Good connection to Cadiz (currently 20 minutes by bus instead of ferry). The sanitary facilities were in good condition and always clean. Good, hot shower (not adjustable, so a little too hot even in winter). The parcels are partly a little uneven on sand. Cost with ACSI Card: 20 euros per night (campervan, 2p., Electricity). Restaurant Hippie very expensive, no vegetarian options"
6399,1713518,4,micha73el,21/12/2021,"Spent three days here before Christmas. Only the nearby sports field is sometimes quite noisy. I paid € 9.10 per day for motorhomes, € 6.30 per person. That’s totally ok. Electricity costs another € 7.20 per day. That's relatively expensive, but overall I think it's okay. Ferry connection to Cadiz is very good. Doesn't run on Sunday, however."
6399,1711352,3,nomadlanders,17/12/2021,Very friendly welcome. Relatively small parking spaces. Clean bathroom \ toilet. Electricity costs 7 euros. 1 Womo approx. 20 €. Around 50 mobile homes in December. I found it calm. Restaurant / breakfast directly at the campsite and open all day. Warning: the area is very windy :) The beach is right across the street. But it is a bay and you can see many industrial plants. OK for one night.

The campsite restaurant is quite good and it is very easy to visit the city thanks to the rental electric scooters on the sidewalk at the exit of the campsite. and possibility of taking public transport to visit Cadiz."
6399,1693369,5,bibi3107,19/11/2021,Super campsite very clean and sanitary at the top. near the sea and the city center to take the bus to Cadiz. The boat not available due to the very strong wind at the moment. very friendly and smiling staff.

Very clean emptying area! We did not use the sanitary facilities which also seemed clean. 2km from the port to take the ferry to Cadiz. The restaurant next door is top notch! We recommend the place."
6399,1662926,4,elliehw,26/10/2021,Perfect campsite to explore Cadiz. Catch the ferry just 15min walk from camp. Staff very friendly and accommodating. Plots are adequate. Lovely beach right outside the front door. Will definitely be back
6399,1657402,3,mich81380,22/10/2021,Well placed for the visit of Cadiz. 2kms from the ferry pier for the crossing to cadiz. correct reception. correct sanitary block. very dusty locations with no privacy. many unoccupied camps (awning caravans) which gives an impression of abandonment. closed swimming pool. barely average value for money.
6399,1652549,3,ralfseefeldt,19/10/2021,"October 32, Euro for 2 people on the sand court, small plot with electrical connection. Space is allocated. the big beautiful part with beautiful places closed. Sanitary facilities are ok. Disposal separate and ok.

It takes over 30 minutes to load a newspaper. If you advertise with free WiFi, it should also work. The catamaran to Cadiz works smoothly and the terminal is just under 2 km from the site. ADAC price € 20."
6399,1625219,3,wimwilting,03/10/2021,We have been here for 2 nights on 2 and 3 October. Swimming pool is probably closed due to late season. Showers and toilets are okay.

6399,1611482,5,jjspoole,27/09/2021,Perfectly placed campsite with modern and clean toilet block. 20 minute walk from the ferry to Cadiz. Great vibrant town in itself! Walk about 150m past the ferry port and the town is on your left. Walk out of the campsite and turn right along the beach and after 25-30 mins you reach a new marina development with great bars and restaurants! We’ll be back!
6399,1611217,5,LHST,27/09/2021,"Good, big camping. Nothing is missing. Large parking spaces. Clean and large sanitary facilities. Ferry to Cadiz in the city center can be reached quickly. Nothing to complain about but a bit too big for us .."

6399,1541394,3,brianfrancis,02/09/2021,"Correct camping to enjoy the atmosphere of the Port, go to Cádiz by ferry, or bathe in the warm waters of the bay. Even so, the nearby beaches are very urban and, if you stay a few days, the ones at the campsite put you in the lower area with little shade and a lot of noise."
6399,1539106,4,adanaui,02/09/2021,"We took it as a base to visit Puerto de Santamaria and with the Cádiz ferry. Even though we were in the parking lot, we were fine. Good facilities (shop and pools to highlight)"

6399,1338630,5,suiseki,18/07/2021,"Very well equipped campsite, the services are new and impeccable and there are a lot of pitches available, the only thing that during the high season they do not accept reservations and you have to go early to secure the site. La Puntilla beach is right across the reception, a real treat!"
6399,1330196,4,Califurgo,16/07/2021,"We don't give it 5 stars because you can't regulate the hot / cold water in the showers. Huge campsite with all kinds of facilities. Plots of all sizes and colors and super new and beautiful bathrooms. Very good price in high season, quality / price."
6399,1290460,2,bendec,02/07/2021,"Everything ok, fair prices, clean showers. Unfriendly staff, temperature of the showers cannot be adjusted, dish water was cold. More recommendable is the parking space 500m further directly on the beach."

6399,1254624,4,Acampa2,14/06/2021,"Camping in general very good, we were very comfortable in the pool, clean bathrooms, however we found it very expensive. The pines release a lot of resin and stain the car and the awning. You pay per person, per vehicle, per pitch, even if you want to put a small awning on your own pitch."
6399,1241167,5,sfr301,07/06/2021,"Great, although the plot they gave me was good, the kid on the bike didn't give us any more options, then others around me were taken care of, so I could have decided on the musma area, for the rest this cream."

6399,968356,5,FranciscoLopezPadin,16/08/2020,Fatal. I call by phone to see if there are places and they tell me that in an hour and a half that I need to get to the best if. Surprise the only parking spaces without electricity and at the same price as in the campsite 42 € three children and two adults in AC. 3 in the morning and does not stop in traffic of cars and people talking loudly.

6399,793688,4,binou,10/03/2020,"The campsite is partly occupied by customers who leave their caravan permanently. The consequence is that there are few places for customers arriving unexpectedly, it was my case I stayed in the reception car park but I paid as if I was on the campsite.

6399,706829,5,Trulalai,28/09/2019,"Huge campsite with many services. We only spent the night and used the showers, but everything looked very careful. There are many shadows and the atmosphere in general is very pleasant. 1 van (2 people) without electricity = € 20"
6399,706513,5,PAVEDA,27/09/2019,"Perfect campsite to spend a few days visiting the area. Very clean toilets, showers with own changing room. The pool is very big. The plots are wide. Recommended"
6399,705427,5,welcome94,26/09/2019,Great campsite in front of the beautiful beach beach and 20 minutes to the pier for Cádiz and 10 minutes more to the busy city center all day with great market and everything you need for a great stay we had to spend 2 days and it's been a 10 days that we are here long live Spain
6399,699246,5,pimalaumi,21/09/2019,"To recommend. large pitches not very shady (parable), sanitary top, staff ok. 36 € ACSI for 2 nights with electricity. a shuttle to the pier would be a plus."
6399,687853,3,madodenis,12/09/2019,Quality price ratio correct. € 19.50 per night without electricity. Clean equipments. But the area reserved for motorhomes is not in the pine forest. Ask to go in the pine forest. It goes without problems and more shade and less wind.
6399,685825,5,jan28850,11/09/2019,"We have been a couple of days in this campsite and the truth is that you can not ask for more. They have clean services, with soap and toilet paper in each WC, quite large plots, next to the beach, yes, it is a bit bad since it has many stones / Chinese and close enough to the town to walk . We will certainly repeat."
6399,682559,3,carlitosnotiebe,09/09/2019,"The campsite is pretty good, it looks clean and beautiful, the price is reasonable and the staff friendly. The only thing that has many rules, which seem good to me, what does not seem right to me is that apparently it is not for everyone, only for Spaniards."
6399,680989,4,Jayla,07/09/2019,"The campsite is quite good, good pool, clean and new services, supermarket, restaurant menu 10 euros, on the beach, although it is not very good, about 2.5 km from downtown and 2 km from the catamaran that takes you to Cadiz, there are Beaches better than camping but you need a car."
6399,678377,3,ea1qa,06/09/2019,"Camping far from the center and the catamaran to pass to Cádiz, 25 min. walking, next to the beach, departure at 12, which conditions you to visit, pool and other correct services."
6399,663812,4,RobleT4,28/08/2019,Camping near the beach and the center of the Port of Sta María (20 min walk) with a great cleaning. Enough land areas and a restaurant with pretty good food. 24 euros 2 people in a van.
6399,644741,1,LAXIENA,20/08/2019,In the end as we had paid 2 days we decided to stay. The issue of the land of the plots to solve it we went to buy an exterior soil. With the 15 prohibitions because by skipping 12 we also solve. We took full advantage of the pool and also took the boat to Cadiz that is close to the Camping ... I still do not recommend this site but good for tastes ... HERE
6399,639980,1,LAXIENA,18/08/2019,"DISAPPOINTING ... Forbidden music in the AC, prohibited drinks and food inside the pool enclosure (bar right next to the pool for you to consume), prohibited pool goggles, floats and a dozen more prohibitions, in order to you pay € 27 a night so you can only breathe and for that with difficulty because there is dirt on all sides.

6399,484441,5,Wolf23,15/05/2019,"Very nicely located campsite. Had a very nice shady place under dense pine trees. Nice staff, very clean toilets. Stayed here for 3 days. Price just under 20 € / night for 2 adults, 1 camper and 2 dogs. (Note: the ferry to Cádiz only takes dogs in a dog box, which you can borrow, but only fit dogs under 5kg)"
6399,475107,3,cm465,03/05/2019,"Camping fun, a little expensive, it lacks games for children to avoid in this period because there is a gathering of bikers on the city and so a lot of noise and prices go up. Sanitary very correct, not bad beach, however, count at least 30 minutes walk to the port and the shuttle to Cadiz"

I wanted to write this review to let people know they have a side gate with no height restriction for entry to the campsite for large vehicles over 3.3m. We just fitted under the normal entry on way in, but used the side gate when exiting, as normal route to exit is tight for large vehicles. Reception open the side gate which is electronic. If your MH is over 3.3m you can still stay. :)"
6399,449615,5,VoyageursJP59,06/04/2019,The only campsite well located to visit Cadiz safely 25 minutes walk from the pier. Attention the entry of the camp-site is limited to 3.30 m of height. Many sunny locations Ok for satellites. The swimming pool is open only in summer.

Wouldn’t let us service previously if not staying on site, even though we offered to pay. Lovely town, great access to Cádiz via ferry or train. If you like sherry & authentic Spain, try Bodega Obregon, it’s special. We were told that on Saturdays they also do food."
6399,434004,4,vicAmengual,26/02/2019,"The site is fine but it is a bit expensive. It must be because there are very few campsites in the area- it is very popular. The showers very well, very clean and hot water."
6399,431460,2,mamyzinzin,20/02/2019,"Home very cold, no commercial sense, at least for non-Spanish speakers. Quickly parked without knowing his number, on top of each other. Very noisy all day because of the stadium nearby. No easy transport on site, for people who have problems to walk. Very expensive, 75 € 2 nights for a camper, 2 adults and electricity. Wifi to pay more. It's abused, I do not recommend."

However, no toilet paper and the temperature of the showers can not be adjusted (water is very hot). Wi-Fi costs extra and is pretty bad."
6399,220410,4,domfav,27/01/2018,"Good camping comfort, more than the nearby areas but to land and take the ferry (25 minutes walk) to Cadiz. height limited 3.50 m at the entrance."

6399,188987,2,Mario93,02/09/2017,"The camping site has a good location. It's really close to the beach. I my opinion it's way to expansive, because there is no space for campers in the shadow. 21€ for 2/P and one campervan without electricity. Electricity 8€!. They have wifi that doesn't work properly, and it's not included as well."

6400,1718638,1,missaglia,29/12/2021,"Do not trust me, they do not only do the loading and unloading services even if it is written here and out of season 27 euros for 2 for one night seems too much to me"
6400,1686204,4,Croxy94,12/11/2021,"The campsite is right in front of the beach which is practical and pleasant. We paid € 21 for two adults and a van without electricity. Lots of plots taken by caravans year round, good for a night out of season otherwise you are on top of each other. The sanitary facilities were very good and very clean."
6400,1684792,3,Sissi22,11/11/2021,"We were disappointed with the pitches too small for a 7m50 motorhome. Lots of trees so no weekend TV. On the other hand, very nice and very clean sanitary facilities. A good adjoining restaurant. Welcoming staff."
6400,1631339,1,Masterptk,07/10/2021,"Clean sanitary facilities, hence a star. I do not recommend this place. Unkempt, uneven and much too expensive! We literally fled after two days!"
6400,1560264,5,keas,08/09/2021,"We were there for three days at the beginning of September and we have been very good. The neighbors of the plot and the street, super kind and friendly. Very clean toilets with a very regular cleaning, pitches with enough shade. Pool with capacity and schedules. Friendly and professional reception, maintenance and cleaning staff. Nearby beach, basic supermarket and correct restaurant bar. ACSI card now."
6400,1393160,5,AntonioHernandezBenitez,02/08/2021,"Plots a little small but great, super clean, toilets and showers cleaned very regularly, it has a fruit bowl and a baker selling at the foot of the plot. pool very good, super friendly staff"
6400,1339741,1,Mahissitan,19/07/2021,"Many permanent campers who build “caves” out of tarpaulins and old furniture. Unkempt, cleanliness ok. Wifi costs and cannot be used. All in all, much too expensive (37 € / night for caravans & 2 people. The beach is not nice. We fled after 2 nights."
6400,1312737,1,magair,11/07/2021,The only good thing that is in front of the beach. Otherwise: not suitable for AC over 7 m. Narrow streets impossible to maneuver. Short pitches for AC. Very expensive for the services it offers and designed only for fixed people who are many. Not recommended
6400,1257825,2,henrik999,16/06/2021,"Sanitary places okay. Beach made of gravel and less beautiful. Otherwise very pleasant. Especially suitable for one night, although quite expensive at 33 €. Wifi was of no use."

6400,1025462,4,Nserra,04/09/2020,"Cozy and quiet campsite and very friendly staff. The pitches and streets are wide although we had to go in the wrong direction because with the motorhome we were driving (7.35 in length and 2.35 in width) some turn was complicated, but they did not cause us problems. For 2 adults and 2 children for 2 nights without electricity we pay € 90."
6400,998429,5,Pitterpj,24/08/2020,Very cozy campsite. Very familiar. Normal price. Very close employees. Good stay and quiet. 100% recommended. On the beachfront.
6400,988133,2,evadiesel,21/08/2020,"The campsite has the essentials, but the squares are a bit tight, or they are narrow and long that you hardly remove the awning or square and short. In August, the square 4 people and electricity € 53. The surroundings are not interesting. Due to Covid, the pool only plays 1 hour and 30 minutes a day and by appointment"

6400,634990,1,Rockrohr,16/08/2019,Friendly staff. Very busy in the main season & loud. 1 night goes by. If you stay longer you have to like the bustle.
6400,480921,2,biloup30,10/05/2019,"Too expensive, 25.30 € early May, 20 € for the night without service. Reception not kind at all? ... we refuse and resume our journey."
6400,424834,1,solber,26/01/2019,"I just took the rates that are not clear on the first page. 25,30 € for a motorhome, two people, electricity, water, garbage. Washing machine € 4.50. Decreasing price from one month: less than 16 € per day."
6400,404321,1,merco80,04/11/2018,"Over four months of travel, it is our saddest and most expensive campsites, value for money, do not look for the stars they are right on the door at the entrance,"
6400,376387,3,carl40,18/09/2018,Camping difficult access with small camper but the problem dozens of cat clamoring to eat
6400,353135,4,jonandv,25/08/2018,"Full service campsite right across the road from the beach. No absolute height restrictions but there are quite a few low hanging trees. The entrance/access is easy enough for bigger motorhomes/RVs but other then the car park area, you won’t get a big vehicle all the way in here. Owners were helpful enough to get our 11m long & 3.8m high RV into their parking area."
6400,219019,5,rolandflageollet,16/01/2018,"Very nice camping “Playa Poniente”. extremely nice people. toilets are very clean, modern and heated which is a great advantage in winter. bus every 1/2h to Motril. beach at 100 m with long walk. on the right, a long stretch without any house, just herbs and the snowy mountains in the background. Motril port is on the left. Repsol is coming in the camping for gas cylinders."

6400,105609,2,cath59,16/09/2016,Camping 100 m from the sea. Sanitary very correct. Small location Difficult to maneuver. If no means of locomotion not interesting because isolated. Motril is not a beautiful city.
6400,100897,1,manuraid,28/08/2016,"Very noisy, at least in summer. The camping well. The problem is where it is located. Party, bottle and nights without sleep. Also if on arrival they see that at least two couples are going, even with children you will be defenestran at the corner of the campsite where there is more party noise. And we with the children. I have come here frequently and I always end up thinking about how noisy it is, but what has happened today has already happened. Do not assign me children with the plot where you know there is more noise. If you put so much effort in silencing the bottle as it is to influence to prohibit the parking of motorhomes in the parking lot in front of the campsite, it would win category."
6400,66299,2,hymercamp,26/03/2016,Camping quiet. Of Second category. In front of the beach. modernized bathrooms. Very fixed with caravan. Normal shadow ACSI Discount
6400,34430,4,deruytter,24/04/2015,"Camping with a good ACSI reception 16 € very neat buildings, look where you are, trees with yellow feathers difficult to remove. Sea three kilometers from the cycle // Camping met goed onthaal acsi 16 € zeer net gebouwen toch opletten waar i staat bomen met gele pluimpjes vekken moeilijk verwijderbaar zee op100 m motril op 3 km fietspad"
6411,3289788,3,krysreine,12/09/2023,"A good alternative to visit Lisbon. The places are sloping and difficult to catch with the wedges. Average sanitary facilities, not very clean. Otherwise the campsite is well signposted and very wooded. The swimming pool is very pleasant. Police officers are there, rotating regularly and monitoring. It's reassuring."
