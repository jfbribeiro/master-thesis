27027,3230989,4,fari2019,28/08/2023,"Some places with a great view, sanitary facilities ok, warm water only in the shower. Two beaches can be reached in 5 minutes. Rather expensive for Spain."
27027,3205368,1,Ferransergio,23/08/2023,"They do not allow dogs. And pay for a parking lot that is right next door to another free one, I don't see it."
27027,3200836,3,tetelle33190,22/08/2023,"Pros: very small campsite with no entertainment, simple, quiet, exactly what we were looking for. 10 minutes from the center on foot, 3 minutes from the beach. Cons: too expensive, 32 euros for 1 van 2 people without elec. New but very dirty sanitary facilities and impractical showers, no hooks or shelves. No soap to wash hands. Cold water for the dishes. Paying water to fill the jerry can."
27027,3169173,4,martasa93,17/08/2023,"It's quite good, a bit expensive, but it's the only thing in Llanes in the middle of August, the services lacked a bit of cleanliness, otherwise it's a very quiet place and it has some views. It cost us €32 for a plot with a van for two people and if you wanted electricity, €5 more"
27027,3111227,4,chiara1012,09/08/2023,"It is certainly more expensive than other campsites (55 euros per night for 4 with electricity), but the campsite is very convenient for reaching the beautiful center of the town, the paseo de San Pedro towards the Po and two comfortable and equally beautiful beaches. Toilet paper is provided upon request. The pitches are not shaded, but it is very windy. We would go back again."
27027,3077101,1,zevictor72,04/08/2023,"Not recommended. On top of the price they charge for the space (€50) electricity apart, when you want to refuel with water inside the campsite, they also charge you. They do not let you pay by card, only in cash. It is well located to see Llanes but they take advantage of it too much ."
27027,3050833,3,soniasla,31/07/2023,"It is only worth it for its location on the beach, close to the town and sea views! A pity that it is so expensive, they charge you for everything, and they don't even put toilet paper. The management is not too good."
27027,3047674,2,Florian1997,30/07/2023,"friendly stuff, complicated to get to a place. 32 or 40 Euro, depending the sea view. Sanitories okay, dish washing Cold. no shadow at all. Beaches Medium. Good: 15 min walk to Center of Llanes"
27027,3001755,1,irenedelatorre,22/07/2023,"disastrous, they charge you for breathing. €32 for a van and two people one night, a robbery. Let's go. Only the views are worth it"
27027,2994982,4,sranaranja,21/07/2023,Lovely campsite on an amazing location. Small “private” beach next to the camping. Nice and clean facilities. Tiny supermarket where you also can buy fresh bread. Little bar next to the supermarket.
27027,2981617,2,runde,18/07/2023,"Nice location, good showers. Excessive price for the services offered Excessively laborious loading and unloading. To get water you have to pay, you need a card with a deposit that does not allow you to fill up. Payment only in cash and without receipt."
27027,2909109,3,Olivertwingo,30/06/2023,squares a little uneven. price difference with respect to the location in wl camping. Very nice views of the beach and cliffs. Practically new bathrooms and hot Aragua €37 2 adults 1 children and a van.
27027,2900030,2,tartaruginha,28/06/2023,"Camping with few services for its price €40 per night, car, 2 pers, 1 child without electricity (in cash) the water filling is charged separately for €1, it does not have a laundry either. Just reformed little things, like the fence, the bathrooms also look like new (very clean). Its plus point is the location (10 min walk to the town) and the views. We spent one night and left."
27027,2826987,4,sandrayruben,06/06/2023,Open from June 1. no dogs allowed
27027,2799607,2,ChristianLeitz,29/05/2023,The campsite is being renovated and is temporarily closed.
27027,2783011,1,beckmaenner,24/05/2023,Place was still closed on 05/24/23 and looked neglected.
27027,2749222,1,lepinejoel,14/05/2023,Don't go there it's closed
27027,2713841,2,vict0r9,01/05/2023,A very nice place. Too bad they don't allow dogs
27027,2685685,1,Angie0477,21/04/2023,Unfortunately it is closed.
27027,2639091,1,lolo2912,04/04/2023,Animals not allowed and reception not very pleasant. So we just passed
27027,2460058,5,julezkoppler,24/10/2022,Camping already closed..
27027,2438239,5,pdomi,11/10/2022,"Good place, clean services and free showers with hot water. Wi-Fi very good."
27027,2362114,3,jobri,11/09/2022,"the place impresses with its location on the cliffs and the proximity to two beautiful beaches and the village. The sanitary facilities are newly renovated, which puts the price into perspective (from €32/2 people or electricity). Unfortunately there is no warm water to rinse off and there are no shady trees."
27027,2333901,1,rosmari74,03/09/2022,"The campsite is ideally located, the village is beautiful, the bathroom is ok...BUT we were given a new price every time (in the end it was 37€ for one night, 2 people and VW bus), you can only pay in cash. Maybe you have to negotiate? The place is carelessly designed unfriendly people and so clumsily fenced that the beautiful view is restricted. Too bad."
27027,2316858,1,Dreveez,29/08/2022,"We went to this campsite to ask for pricing and possibilities for staying with our Volkswagen type California. Pricing appeared high, but we were willing to do it. When asked if we could walk around to see facilities and possible spots to stay, the answer was short: NO. When I asked for the reason the guy started to argue. It's all up to you, fellow travellers, but we skipped this one."
27027,2269794,1,CormierJustin,19/08/2022,"We selected this campsite with a sea view at first sight... Unfortunately no sea view finally seen on dilapidated fence, shabby location not maintained exorbitant price 40€ for two people a van (no electricity) average reception, no hot water for the dishes and hot water cut off from 10 p.m. in the sanitary facilities... In short, go your way, it's better for you"
27027,2236989,1,carmsteph,14/08/2022,"Campsite well located for visiting the city which is very pleasant. Apart from that the pitches are badly done, one on top of the other. We paid to be on the sea side and did not have it because few CCs can park there… very expensive and payment only in cash… water for the CC is also payable… we do not recommend!"
27027,2233881,2,Anne-SophiePHELIX-FAUBREJON,14/08/2022,"Campsite ideally located for visiting the pretty town of Llianes, taking walks and enjoying the 2 beaches. The view is magnificent for those who have a view of the sea. For the rest, it's pathetic! The toilets are really not practical, the pitches are small for some and tilted with huge holes, as for the reception, it is deplorable. €56 per night for a CC for 4 people."
27027,2233014,2,WolliNit,14/08/2022,"40€ for 2 people, really expensive. And fresh water comes extra."
27027,2205432,4,carrozavip,09/08/2022,"It is a basic camping but it fulfills the functions to spend a night and see the town, you cannot ask for more. Enough clean showers"
27027,2195864,3,MariayBayo,08/08/2022,Campsite with good views as its name suggests between two beaches. It is divided into two parts downstairs next to the beach €40 two people with a van upstairs next to the road €32 option that we have taken without any inconvenience. It is quite expensive but for the area all have the same price. In our case the treatment has been normal since we have only spent one night. Basic services.
27027,2190668,4,MegNug2151,07/08/2022,"Very nice campsite! The staff isn't the friendliest but apart from that it's very good: super clean toilets and showers, all services available and not overly expensive, close to everything on foot, and a magnificent view. Only small problem is that you can't book it's haphazard. but still very good"
27027,2187745,3,gllalberto,06/08/2022,Very expensive campsite with a very bad treatment of the worst in years. Very good views and proximity to llanes. They do not accept card
27027,2081565,4,rebecahuerta28,16/07/2022,"Camping just 10 minutes walk from the center of Llanes. It is literally between two super nice beaches. We were charged €32 for two adults and a van, one night. Yes, it is more expensive than usual, but it is worth it for the excellent location next to a place as beautiful as Llanes. Super clean bathrooms. There is not a shadow, but to spend the night it is great."
27027,2076159,1,fufubimbaylolo,15/07/2022,There is no shade and also…. They don't let dogs...
27027,2073398,1,jammstyler,14/07/2022,"Jammstyler was here…and he's gone. Nice views at fairly high prices. 38 euros plot in 2nd line, 40 euros in first + 8 euros each adult. We won't be back."
27027,2072175,2,Bushtrece,14/07/2022,"The enclave is wonderful and the bathrooms are very clean, these are my 2 stars. The rest; disastrous customer service. You can only pay in cash. There is no soap or toilet paper in the bathroom, to refill the water tank, 1 euro, in advance, and with a timer, which they do not warn. There is no shade, you can not put strings. And at 11 p.m., the lights go out. You cannot choose a plot."
27027,2070062,4,FonsoCampoo,13/07/2022,"Quiet campsite, good service facilities and very clean toilets and showers, it is a pity that the beaches to which it gives access are very small and rocky."
27027,2063714,4,Nicsel,12/07/2022,"It's more expensive, but great location, free choice of seats and super clean sanitary facilities. A star deduction for the ""security fence"" would come again."
27027,2042066,1,ticu,05/07/2022,"It did not seem normal to me that they asked me €53 for an overnight stay in a motorhome, 3 people and electricity, they are free to ask for whatever they want but I think it is a joke."
27027,2017226,1,Familiass,28/06/2022,"We chose the campsite because of its good location, but it should be for adults only, since when they saw that we had children they asked us for all of them's ID and the oldest was 9 years old, they did not let us camp as we did not have the minors' ID. The guy at the reception not friendly."
27027,1967786,4,ivangregor,11/06/2022,"4 stars for the hot shower but it has cost €30 for 2 people in tourism (we slept in it and yes ... they charge it as a sleeping car / motorhome). The campsite store closed on this date. There was a lot of wind day and night. Following the street there is a bar run by a very friendly local woman and on the corner there is a shop/greengrocer, they open at 9 o'clock or less."
27027,1918269,3,Muemmelmann,26/05/2022,"Spot looks very nice on the cliff. However, when we arrived today (May 26) it was closed with a small sign saying they will only open on June 1. Unfortunately there was no hint on their website when I checked before."
27027,1864012,3,TrumpetDave,01/05/2022,"A well positioned cliff edge site with very clean and modern toilet facilities which we couldn’t fault, (but be prepared to supply your own loo rolls!) Easy walking to a very vibrant town with lots of good bars and restaurants. What lets this site down is the site fee (34 euros in early May) when the pitches are somewhat uneven and not yet mowed. Only stayed one night because of over the top fees."
27027,1828430,3,webs,16/04/2022,"Clean and well-kept facilities, wonderful views of the sea and very suitable for resting, silence at night, very good service. There are no shadows, which complicates it on days with a lot of sun and high prices: two people and one van without electricity, one night €30."
27027,1826421,2,xijules1,16/04/2022,"Very expensive for what it is. You pay for the location, which is great. In the bathroom, which is quite new, there is no soap, paper or a place to sit or to leave the toiletries or to sit down to get dressed. Well located but limited services."
27027,1825675,1,gasoalhambra,15/04/2022,The place is very good but it doesn't have any trees and a lot of rudeness to the children I don't let them take out the bike and the boy was not very nice
27027,1819028,4,arinbronx,13/04/2022,"Open from April 8, 2022. Easy access, incredible scenery with the sea, the plains and the Picos de Europa surrounding you. Quiet and perfect place to unwind. We paid 30 euros: two adults and a camper. Clean showers and toilets. Fill 60 L of water: €1"
27027,1815947,4,HeinoHorstmann,11/04/2022,The campsite exists and is open. Little going on at the moment. Beautiful location and newly designed sanitary facilities.
27027,1600925,1,SofisPzg,22/09/2021,"Camping closed in September. impossible to contact by phone, and the web does not have information about opening seasons. You get stuck with all the way done."
27027,1600207,1,muerrrte,22/09/2021,Closed. All accesses with problems and the Civil Guard on top touching their noses
27027,1589421,1,Papyducati,18/09/2021,Campsite Closed on 09/18/21
27027,1573409,4,xevisonia,12/09/2021,"Nice campsite due to its proximity to the sea, that is, without privacy, there is no separation between the plots. The bathrooms very clean and the staff quite dry. Another plus point is that it is close to the center on foot."
27027,1569424,2,felicia96,11/09/2021,"The good thing is that it is close to the town, to walk without problems and the showers and bathroom are very clean. Now both the treatment by the staff very dry and very expensive for what they give ... if you go with a van and need showers it is very good but we who went in AC is not worth it"
27027,1558941,4,anakle,08/09/2021,"It is not cheap (€ 41.50 AC, 2 adults, 2 children and electricity, but you pay willingly. 10 min walk to the center, spectacular views, you can pour gray water, there are bathrooms to shower ... It is a esplanade quiet, I definitely recommend it."
27027,1534117,3,albaron,31/08/2021,"32 euros per night without electricity, two adults, one child and AC. Pitches with some incline and without shade. Good situation."
27027,1523644,4,marcosfortun,28/08/2021,"A little more expensive than normal (€ 32 / night with electricity). No shade, although it is not too hot (even in August). The plots are not completely level, but it is solved with chocks. Otherwise, all good. Clean, quiet and well located. The best thing is the sound of the waves of the sea when you go to sleep."
27027,1501256,5,cristy,23/08/2021,"Good small campsite but perfect to visit the town taking a walk not far! Two precious plants, one with access from the campsite, the other one from the other famous, 5 mit walking. Price € 25, super clean and renovated bathrooms. Poti emptying correct the bad tea they charge 1 € x fill water"
27027,1482531,1,corrius,19/08/2021,Very expensive camping and on top of it very unpleasant staff
27027,1461624,4,JenniEckersley,15/08/2021,"Busy camp-site, mixture of vans and tents. nice shower block and can fill up water tank for €1 for 50l of water. no laundry facilities. but short distance to beach and nearby town centre. cost is €32.50 for one campervan 2 people and electric which I thought was quite expensive."
27027,1457015,3,verito84,14/08/2021,"It is not a campsite in itself, it is an esplanade without any shade in which they have put a hut with new bathrooms, 28 euros for 2 adults to spend the night in a van. It is located between two beaches and 5 minutes from the center of Llanes, a beautiful town that deserves to visit. To fill clean water you have to pay 1 euro leaving 3 euros as a deposit for the card that activates the deposit."
27027,1452461,4,chospe4,13/08/2021,"Good night, new and clean bathrooms. They give a roll of toilet paper at the entrance. In the town and next to two beaches"
27027,1434234,1,ba2r,10/08/2021,Well located campsite. But the owners are very rude and not at all welcoming.
27027,1434225,1,antoine3164,10/08/2021,Campsite well placed but the reception is horrible. The owners are rude and not at all welcoming. Horrible welcome and departure which spoiled this stop.
27027,1412213,4,carolcica,06/08/2021,"Very well located, almost direct access to 2 beaches, and 5 minutes walk from the center of Llanes. Exceptional view. Family campsite, very friendly staff. New and very clean sanitary facilities. Note: no games for children, hot water only in the showers, quite expensive (41 € for 2 adults 2 children electricity) but that seems to be the price here, but the ideal situation consoles!"
27027,1407591,5,TarragoCuenca,05/08/2021,Good treatment ideal for a good shower very clean. Accessible to the center of Llanes which is beautiful. We had a breakdown in the water pump and the boy from the campsite helped us and advised us about it. recommendable
27027,1406314,5,grgasnier,05/08/2021,"Top view, gray water drain, easy access to clean water. between sea and mountain, great!"
27027,1403824,5,MSIAC,04/08/2021,The views are perfect. perfect the area near the town. perfect tranquility. perfect and clean bathrooms. Quite spacious pitches with a light point A little more sympathy in the treatment of the reception as something to improve.
27027,1400820,5,SantiGallardo,03/08/2021,"If you want to visit Llanes, spend the night by the sea, on a large plot of grass, and also with new and clean bathrooms and showers, this is the place. 5 min walk from the town center. The showers have hot water included in the price (in other places they charge you separately) and they are very clean. There is no toilet paper in the bathrooms, but you get a roll when you arrive."
27027,1366648,4,js3010,26/07/2021,"Stayed here for 1 night. No complaints, staff at the reception was very friendly. Very close to Llanes, so perfectly fine to go on foot. New & clean bathrooms."
27027,1275102,1,alexgari,24/06/2021,"Near the town, spacious plots and good views. Precarious AC emptying and filling area, it is a poorly positioned manhole. New outdoor sinks, toilets and showers. They gave us a roll of toilet paper at the entrance. No paper or hand soap is used in the bathrooms. Expensive for the services it has, AC € 14 / day without electricity and € 7 person / day."
27027,1054087,1,maryluc,17/09/2020,"Nothing recommendable. very dry and rude staff. We went to get ice and the lady had the Saints ** to tell us that she had one, and that she wouldn't sell it to us !!!! the soil of the plots full of cut grass without collecting! They tell us no dogs but not that they close the next day. hour of silence on a Saturday at 11pm. Dirty bathrooms (mud and grass). it is clear that they wanted to end the season !!!"
27027,1038494,4,Mirynda,10/09/2020,"Campsite on a cliff with spectacular views of the sea. There were few people and we were able to park on a lot facing the sea. It is close to Llanes, we were walking to the center in 5-10 min max. The showers and toilet are new and clean. Price 1 night motorhome +2 adults 28 euros."
27027,1026580,3,Santinano,05/09/2020,"The place is nice, but it seems expensive to me for the services it has, if it is true that the bathrooms have been renovated, and the bad thing is that you cannot enter with dogs ..."
27027,1010381,1,Aalj,28/08/2020,"Very good situation and views between two beaches but quite shabby. There is no paper in the toilets and no soap. It is an esplanade with grass. We went without reading the comments because if not, I would not have gone. I agree that the staff is quite rude. The worst thing was that at the entrance they did not inform us that they did NOT allow dogs, so when we had a night, they kicked us out in a bad way."
27027,1007519,3,palambre,27/08/2020,"Very well located campsite with unbeatable views. clean toilets and all good. when we left we were emptying the water and filling up before we left, it was 12.30 and the lady from the campsite called our attention several times for us to leave ... polite manners but very rough and dry, unpleasant"
27027,996978,4,Martarom,23/08/2020,Camping with all services and very well located to visit Llanes or go to the beach. The camping staff is not very friendly ..... Motorhome + light + 2 adults = 32.50 € / 1 night August
27027,982415,1,aguacate2020,19/08/2020,"Horrible staff, we already had a problem with the light and we had to go to reception up to 3 times and they were all sitting outside taking the fresh air. They also wanted to give us a parcel to park in parallel when they had better free parcels."
27027,973188,4,inmagaji,17/08/2020,"The campsite is not prepared for AC, the emptying area on a slope, the dirty drain 50m on foot and elevated. Very superb and unpleasant staff with the customer, very poor organization. They forced us to carry out a risky maneuver with the AC, when we told them they told us that at their campsite they do whatever they want. Very arrogant and rude, we do not recommend it."
27027,969305,1,andrearomera,16/08/2020,DO NOT ACCEPT DOGS !! There is also no shade. Location close to town

27027,901791,4,Aleximonica,26/07/2020,"Good camping to visit llanes, very good views, on a cliff. 5 min from the center, much better than the car area that was to petar."
27027,900563,1,RSoftware,26/07/2020,"In the line of hostile territory for motorhomes, like the entire municipality of Llanes. He didn't even let us in to see the plots and facilities. They will know what kind of tourists want in Llanes."
27027,891668,4,Josecar,23/07/2020,"Camping with all services. Bathrooms and showers are new and very clean. They are continuously disinfected. At the top of a cliff and near two small but very beautiful coves, better to take advantage of the low tide. The town is within walking distance. The plots a little fair for the advance. For 2 nights, without electricity, 3 adults and a child, € 80."
27027,887765,2,levoyagedalbert,22/07/2020,"The place is very beautiful. Nice view, close to the city. The sanitary facilities have been redone, they are magnificent. On the other hand, we paid 88 € for two nights (Campingcar, 2 adults, an 11 year old child and a 9 year old child + electricity). We found it horribly expensive !!!"
27027,881197,3,blackhorse,19/07/2020,"Acceptable, very clean and new sinks. Near the town, you can walk."
27027,881113,4,rociomarto,19/07/2020,"A campsite without great facilities, but the ones that are there are useful and functional. It has beautiful views and the plots are quite spacious. It is 10 minutes from the town center and there is a beach 4 minutes walk."
27027,880290,1,jasminc,19/07/2020,"Nice staff, unfortunately I can't think of any other positive aspects. I felt like I was in a youth camp. Sanitary facilities dirty, no soap, no toilet paper in the toilets, no possibility to hang towels, everything was very impractical and not comfortable!"

27027,864458,4,vita75,12/07/2020,"Very quiet campsite with incredible views, renovated toilets and a short walk from the center and the hill beach"
27027,860915,1,IPalma,11/07/2020,They don't accept dogs so we couldn't stay. We were struck by the fact that with such a good location there were few occupied spaces. We went to Las Conchas.
27027,850117,5,Mariuge,05/07/2020,"Camping with magnificent views, next to the silver of Toró. Completely renovated, both toilets and plots, very good service.

There is not a shadow. They charged us 65 euros for four people a night. We had to pay half a day more for leaving later than 12 noon. The only positive is the proximity to Llanes.

Two restaurants, one supermarket and you can't pay with a €100 bill Reception without solutions"
27061,2348068,4,Noahneta,07/09/2022,"New facilities and very friendly staff. The rate in low season is more than correct €30 GV, two adults and electricity. Before entering the campsite there is gray water emptying and a machine to clean the WC cassette for €2, I do not recommend it, I expected it to be clean and my surprise was that it does not clean it 100%, it leaves a layer of residue. To repeat for sure!"

Sanitary extra with showers in Algecos that are always dirty. Tiny location with the smell of rubbish going back. Nice staff at the reception anyway. Camping remains expensive for insufficient benefits."
27061,547563,4,Enpac,10/07/2019,"A large campsite, a swimming pool for children, a beach is small, bad because there are others who are not in the camp and there is a crowd on the beach for the weekend.

The plots do not have much privacy but it makes up for being in the nature surrounded by trees and vegetation. The services are correct. The price in the most expensive sector for 2 adults and a 2 year old child was € 36. We will return for sure!"
27061,349992,4,bouboutravel,23/08/2018,Cool campsite. Sanitary ultra clean. Perfect to start again at 0 level linen and toilets. A bit pricey in high season but quite easy availabilities for van locations (crowded beach)

There is a central area around a creative garden with bar, hangout (inside) + vintage seats. Sea view from camper part. No playground. Toilet block small, arty, festival touch. Must love.

We are far, very far from mass camping, here it is camping with a ""human dimension"". The only downside is the close proximity to the fairly busy AC-550 road, at least during the day. Correct price: around 25 € for 2 adults + converted van + electricity. Cozy and affordable bar. Several spots are reserved for tents but the ESA 2 managers (they speak English) will find you a stable and shaded spot for your CC! Attention, no swimming pool, nor gray water drainage as tagged by the OP. The beach (idyllic and very clean + nudist) is 200m at the end of a footpath starting from the campsite and winding in the middle of the pine forest and Atlantic ferns ... superb!"

27123,322944,4,charlotte47,09/08/2018,Spot very nice despite it is right next to the road. We hear more the sound of the sea and waves than the road. On the other hand very windy.
27123,284110,4,claudiadpn,09/07/2018,Great ocean view. We had clouds but it must be a great place to see the sunset. It's next to the road but not a lot of passing at night so top. Then very rocky so the sound of the waves is nice.

There is a bar right next door, so if you consume something you can use the bathroom (food price is somewhat high, although it is worth having a drink watching the sunset)"

The toilets open at 11am and close at 8pm, the showers around 10am had water but I don't know if there is water during the night... it's next to the marshes so lots of mosquitoes! Dusk looks very beautiful. In general we have had a good night."
27160,2912821,5,Biak,01/07/2023,"Spectacular parking to spend the night, very quiet with more AC. The police came by and said good morning to us seeing that it was not camping, it is allowed to stay overnight as long as it is not camping.

27160,2642143,3,furgomundi,05/04/2023,"Free parking for vans and Ac. In beachfront. A quiet and noiseless place! The worst thing is that it does not have a bathroom or shower, at least outside the summer season. Windy!!"

27160,2623739,5,mjvemg,25/03/2023,Excellent park up. No services. We were there for 2 nights. Short walk to a lovely beach. Not sure about this pace when it’s gets busy. The police came by and smiled both days. But if this car park was full I wonder if they’ll be so accommodating. We cycled into Cadiz. About 27mes round trip.
27160,2620730,5,pamadama,23/03/2023,"Fantastic place! Spent 2 nights with small kids here. Police cars checking this place regularly, it´s OK to stay overnight (at least in low season). Slowly sloping sandy beach just across the not too busy road. Nice for cycling trip on around and to San Fernando, no cycling path. Waste bins, no other services. Can get windy, but understandable with Atlantic ocean nearby! 100% would recommend!"

27160,2603767,4,Wunderkinder,09/03/2023,"The place is really really good. It is super big and hardly ever visited at the moment, and several large mobile homes are also well distributed here. Don't hesitate to collect the rubbish from the others, there are large containers for disposal on site. The place is flat and directly on the Atlantic, long sandy beach and possibly beautiful sunsets. The waves are loud at night. Cannon shots are sometimes."
27160,2603217,5,JCPORFIRIO,08/03/2023,"We spent two very pleasant nights in this wonderful place. Despite the fact that, at this time of the year, there are no services available, there aren't many people either, which makes it a good place to connect with the surrounding nature. We were lucky not to be bothered by mosquitoes or noisy visitors. Unfortunately, some visitors leave an impressive amount of rubbish on the site."

27160,2572372,4,camper_stan,09/02/2023,"We stayed for one night, nice and quiet. 

Police drive by regularly in the day, maybe due to the nearby military base. 

I think it may be a dogging spot, lots of cars acting strange."
27160,2569861,1,Bertrand9258,06/02/2023,Passages and noise of cars in the parking lot until late at night every day. Meeting place ? Nothing to do with sleepers when there are miles of parking on the street next door. Too bad the place would be perfect otherwise.
27160,2562348,5,Hymer17000,28/01/2023,Very pleasant flat parking where you feel safe. Close to the beach and beautiful walks. Access in 20 minutes by motorbike from the old center of Cadiz. Indeed near military zone but the shootings took place only on Friday morning.

Great for hiking through the dunes on paved paths. The police drove across the square several times. That conveys security. We give the pitch a top recommendation.
27160,2534551,3,DaRod,30/12/2022,You can spend a night here. But it is nothing realy special. Just if You don’t have any other options.

As it is an official parking area, I had no problems to stay overnight. Police passed by a few times and did not say anything. Quiet nights, during the day and early evening some traffic but not disturbing. May be different in main season. Nice are."

No toilets or shops close."

It is only a few meters walk to the beach. The toilet on the beach was no longer in operation, which is probably due to the low season. We could still use the beach showers. The place is highly recommended."

27160,1783102,3,Papy45,14/03/2022,"Peaceful place. ""weird"" in the evening or at night with many passing cars (traffic ???), but without any other annoyance than the noise of the wheels. On the other hand many ""vanlifer"" which are disgusting: normal by reserves of waste water, nor toilet. And we associate that with motorhomes...."
27160,1781610,4,BlueLotus64,13/03/2022,Large parking lot. Very quiet even on a Saturday night. 12 RVs here tonight. Police drove past 4 times without saying anything. Out of season no beach shower or toilet

27160,1777017,5,femke22,08/03/2022,Nice big parking lot with fairly level spots. You can walk straight onto the beach from the parking lot. Had a quiet night. During the day and in the evening some scooters and other cars drive through the parking lot.
27160,1776104,5,ph85,07/03/2022,Large stabilized parking lot facing the marshes and the sea where we spent a very quiet night with other motorhomes. Thanks to the Municipality of San Fernando who have arranged the seafront very well so that everyone can enjoy it. Superb walk by a wooden footbridge to the “punta del boquerón” and return by the beach (9.5 Kms). One of our best areas in Andalusia.

Some other car came with the music a little loud but they took it off after a few minutes, they probably caught their attention. There are no services. I called the local police before and they told me that I could spend the night without problems."

27160,1746560,2,denisschubi,03/02/2022,The spot is really nice and super close to the beach. What we didn’t know - right next to it there is a military shooting range and apparently they also test something that is as loud as bombs. It completely freaked out our dog. Therefore I wouldn’t recommend this place with dogs…
27160,1738140,5,DaviniaBelinda,21/01/2022,"A good place to spend the night. At night you don't hear any noise and the beach is just across the street.

27160,1721656,4,jennysevans,01/01/2022,"Flat parking, easy access to very beautiful beach.

However from the constant late night traffic, and the items found on my litter pick, it is quite clear that this is a very frequented dogging spot. The constant stream of cars in and out lasted until about 2am and because the surface is gravel it creates noise.

Lot of vans there in December."

Very correct price, €25.50 for a van and a carrietta, 3 people + a dog for one night. Welcoming staff, the bathrooms are old but clean. No complaints."
27246,2782987,5,roma56,24/05/2023,what a lovely place to be. the creativity you encounter everywhere is amazing. all art on site is a reflection of the owners. It's nice for us to discover that there are still campsites like this.

27246,2477865,2,Tumas,01/11/2022,"It has very good views, but the plots have a lot of unevenness. The bathrooms, although clean, are from 3 or 4 decades ago... And that is the general of this campsite, 30 years ago would be great, but they have to be updated. The prices are very expensive for the campsite that it is, and you have to pay even the dog... The restaurant has very generous portions at an acceptable price, normal quality."
27246,2437969,4,did41800,11/10/2022,very nice welcoming of young people! good location at the foot of the castle! (not to be missed!) and superb view from the campsite! proper sanitary facilities!
27246,2435423,5,PjotrTolski,10/10/2022,"We enjoyed this (at the moment) quiet campsite. Nice people (with Google translate you will come a long way). Camperloospunt (gray and black water) is opposite the toilet block, a pit in the road. You can flush the toilet with a long yellow hose on the side of the toilet building."
27246,2417309,5,jasmijnenalex,02/10/2022,"Fantastic place with nice staff. Very nice view over the plain on one side with a beautiful sunset and on the other side the castle. Sanitary slightly older, but clean and good hot water. €21 per night with electricity with 2 adults"

27246,2259465,4,NaiSemgiKing,18/08/2022,"Very green plots. Good deal. Quiet, small pool. You can walk to the horse riding, ideal if you go with children."
27246,2125554,5,teluis,26/07/2022,"We are at the campsite, we have been a day. Very quiet and cozy. Small but with a swimming pool (small but sufficient) and playground. Good views from the bar terrace. Showers and toilets very clean. The downside, to empty gray is in the middle of the track through which you access the plots and for the chemist you have to ask for a key. Total tranquility, a joy."
27246,2058575,5,dirme,10/07/2022,"Small campsite but I loved it, small pool. It has a restaurant and a store, a barbecue house, clean bathrooms. Spacious plots with grass."

27246,1944853,3,JaviImbernon,04/06/2022,"The water area for motorhomes was a disaster, very improvable, it was a sewer that had to be uncovered and drained and a hose from the sinks to fill. Very poorly leveled plots and those that are more leveled do not have light points. The bathrooms are very clean but old. The plots have grass but as they have sprinklers all day they are very soft to fit and the wheels slip."
27246,1832813,4,nomad2000,17/04/2022,"Camping very one located to visit the castle of Loarre and do some routes in the area, very clean bathrooms and large plots, highly recommended. Exquisite bar food."
27246,1644750,5,Manuel_M,14/10/2021,"Very nice, cheap place, with all services, with a bar and a small commissary. The clerks are very nice. If I can, I will return because the area is highly recommended and I have much to see."

Friendly welcome, fair price, nickel sanitary facilities, amazing view, small but nice swimming pool! A great discovery (29euros, truck two adults two children and electricity 08/09/21) family campsite which is worth the detour! Do not forget to visit the castle of Loarre on the way!"

27246,681541,5,didivisi,08/09/2019,"A real little paradise. The pitches are very well maintained. The impeccable toilets. One of the most beautiful nature campsites we have done. It's very beautiful here. We did mountain biking: a lot of tracks but beware, difficult because the ground consists of a layer of round and slippery pebbles."
27246,606652,3,proteodorotea,07/08/2019,Camping very well. the only bad thing is. The danger of trees. in motorhome very low .. and if you do not go with 4 eyes you hit on them .. otherwise price quality. Correct clean services Nice views of the area
27246,599560,1,Cinti,04/08/2019,"My partner and I have spent a night with two furry and van, 22 euros and the perfect camping, very nice. Small but with everything necessary. Our disappointment comes in the service of the restaurant bar .. terrible, nothing attentive and two hours to eat a menu for 19 euros of which they did not have most of the seconds ... unfortunate service."
27246,587769,5,wernermueller,31/07/2019,Very nice nature camping with green lawn. Very quiet. Great view. Great menu in the restaurant for 19 € with wine. 2persons and camper and dog for 16 €.

27246,314029,2,paracolodu3,04/08/2018,"We have been there since last night. It is armored world .... noise, no rules regarding vehicle traffic schedules inside .... moped at 23:30 ...... etc. The corner is nice and offers the possibility of a walk from the campsite. The wifi works in the bar restaurant but not much further ..... the rates are higher than elsewhere. No waste water disposal .... for 21 euros my night it's disappointing."

27261,3292293,4,Pittle,13/09/2023,Great location. Two air drains are available. You must arrive before 11 a.m. to have a place. This day there were many places which filled up afterwards. Environment a little noisy during the day but quiet at night
27261,3291102,5,MoratinoBalbu,13/09/2023,"Well located, all services for 10 euros a day. The only negative point is that we had to wait for a free place. They are always free first thing in the morning."
27261,3289979,4,natandgil,12/09/2023,"Very very well located, we are close but frankly not inconvenient, since everyone visits the city which is worth the detour, charming and full of entertainment! No problem getting in or getting out too easy but quickly full so good luck!"
27261,3283047,2,FFRM,11/09/2023,"Public parking reserved for campers. 2 euro only gray / black water and drain. 10 euros for 24 hours with water, gray/black waste and electricity (if you're lucky, there are more pitches than sockets). 15 minutes walk from the center. Next to a busy main road. Presence of cameras but anyone can come in to bother."
27261,3278626,1,Unaisola,09/09/2023,It said I was free. They charged us €10 and there was no room. We parked next to a motorhome. The guard came and made us. for us to make a claim.
27261,3257616,5,lavero11,04/09/2023,"Area ideally located for visiting Pamplona. Parking for 24 hours, water, drains, electricity for €10. Noise from the boulevard limited at night. The only problem is the barrier camera which has difficulty reading foreign license plates, so you have to call the intercom to open it. Other than that, top notch."
27261,3257191,5,Falcon71,04/09/2023,"excellent option to visit Pamplona. Walking to the old town a walk...5min. If it is full, parking option in front."
27261,3248693,4,Pedro1951mayo,02/09/2023,"In front of this area, which is phenomenal but has few spaces, there is a very large paid parking lot, which is free for the first 24 hours."
27261,3245844,3,51148,01/09/2023,"very clean area, correct width seats, all services and electricity for 10 euros, 10 minutes from the center, really great. The seats on the left when entering are a little noisy, the boulevard passes right behind, but it's reasonable. against no shadow. you can't have everything."
27261,3243391,5,CAWoMo,31/08/2023,"Super parking space, very centrally located, not far to walk into town. V and E as well as electricity incl. Pitches are laid out nicely and everything is very clean. Top recommendation for a maximum of two nights to visit the city."
27261,3234470,5,JORDI2EURA,29/08/2023,"Good area, with a normal payment for the service they provide. By mid-morning in August it is already full, but on the other side of the avenue there is a car park where motorhomes are allowed if that happens. A curiosity: they say that vehicles must enter the square facing each other, which no one ever does here or anywhere."
27261,3230856,3,IreneGO.,28/08/2023,the only free plot was next to the void of gray and black water. it is separated by a bushy line but insufficient to stop the bad smell. It should be noted that there are those who had discharged black water into the gray water grid. for 10 euros they could also have some public toilets
27261,3226136,4,Kiwisontour_,27/08/2023,"This park was full when we arrived. However, we found a large car park directly across the road that is free for motor homes for twenty four hours. Lots of motorhomes parked, we spent a quiet night . The area is well lit, very flat and large. Totally recommend it."

27261,3214467,4,Monipatry,25/08/2023,"Area near the urban area, the old town about 15 minutes walk. Perfect to visit the city and spend the night. Correct in services and wc and light. Quiet at night, the road passes next to it, if you are a light sleeper it might bother you a bit. If I return to Pamplona I will repeat"
27261,3210825,4,chrispn33620,24/08/2023,"Nice car park, be careful with the electricity because there are not enough outlets, it's a bit of a war to get juice. Petrol station nearby with mini-market and city center very close by bike. We will come back."
27261,3192658,4,marilenatanci,21/08/2023,Excellent rest area for visiting Pamplona is very close to the center. There is discharge and discharge of water + electricity. There are no bathrooms. Stop for 24h 10 euros.
27261,3190815,4,califoscolo,20/08/2023,"Great area, convenient and close to the city center. Well maintained. I recommend paying just before leaving, not before. 10€ Max 48 hours Very hot in this period, but it is a parking area. Lots of buses pass so it's noisy. Still recommended for a visit to the city"
27261,3179679,4,GiancarloRuggi,19/08/2023,"Parking equipped with water and electricity, good price of 10 euros for 24 hours. There are no places in the shade, but it's a car park, not a campsite, so it's an excellent opportunity to visit Pamplona, which is not far away."
27261,3177777,4,Evaheemskerk,19/08/2023,Great place if you want to visit Pamplona. Everything close by. NB; you have to pay on entry otherwise you will have problems getting out. Very full so you have to be there on time.

27261,3148884,2,panterarosa78,14/08/2023,"Next to the area there is a building where young people gather during the night who, with their screams, do not let them sleep. To be a paid and well-located area, the council should control this. a pity"
27261,3148073,4,ManjiRonin,14/08/2023,good urban area to visit the old town of pamplona. Just 15 minutes walk from the center.
27261,3142988,5,JDIC,14/08/2023,"One of the best areas we have been to. Clean, stable ground and very close to the old town of Pamplona. Of course, you have to go first thing in the morning since it is not possible to book and it is usually very crowded! On the way to the old town there are very cool parks for the little ones."
27261,3138839,3,Judrov4,13/08/2023,"It is a very good area. The downside is that it puts you free on the sign outside the parking lot even if it is full. However, when you turn left at the roundabout there is another very large car park where you can leave it for free for the first 24 hours."
27261,3133940,5,tpues,13/08/2023,Good place to visit Pamplona. 15 minutes walk from the historic center. All the services. The only bad thing is that it has no shade.
27261,3130353,5,LindaSurCamp,12/08/2023,"In many cities we have not stopped to visit them for lack of places like this! Thanks to the city of Pamplona! All functional, the center can be reached by bus or on foot (if you have a dog you cannot enter by bus). At the petrol station behind is a small Careffour express. Beautiful park between the parking lot and the city."
27261,3129437,1,Elpebe,12/08/2023,Be careful when you come in you pay 10 euros to go out! Even if there is no room.
27261,3123226,5,SilandIndi,11/08/2023,There are municipalities that know the importance of having areas for AC like this one. Thanks Pamplona!! Close to the center and with everything you need to spend one or more nights... I want a place in San Fermin!!
27261,3121778,4,Laura_PC,11/08/2023,"Good area if you visit the city or catches you to stop on the trip. Well located, which is why it is usually full and the light connection is broken, so it is not possible to connect all the available places."
27261,3115753,3,cacawette,10/08/2023,"Very quickly full and... very tight parking lot. Very clean and new. But the simplest, park opposite, 24 hours free, non-renewable, space...and come to the area to get your oil changed for 2€. there are 2 drain locations."
27261,3115016,5,patrickhu,10/08/2023,small parking lot near the fire station and a relatively quiet gas station if you park near the lawn at 3:00 a.m. the automatic watering system is on it was very hot we had to close a window because the water was spraying us in our bed finally a bit of freshness
27261,3102116,3,marievinssi,08/08/2023,"Very clean and perfectly equipped to empty these waters and fill them but very busy. Little chance of finding a place to park there. However, there is another car park just opposite but this one does not have electricity."
27261,3095416,5,Nadstrip,07/08/2023,Very good for visiting the old town on foot! Do not miss the arenas? we did not sleep in this area. Arrive at the end of the morning to have room in this season.
27261,3090852,5,Saseali,06/08/2023,"We love coming to this area, it has all the services and is regulated to 48 hours, there are no leveraged people and there is always movement and free places."

27261,3063484,5,MinghiX,02/08/2023,top x visit the city. I don't understand who reported the toilets or the swimming pool. it is a parking lot with electricity convenient to the city.
27261,3062363,5,DebboDiego,02/08/2023,"Convenient in the center, clean, light included, very comfortable loading / unloading area. €10 for 24h"
27261,3057027,4,JetPomper,01/08/2023,Great overnight place. You walk straight into town. Be on time is popular. No toilet and showers seen.
27261,3055100,2,Zesarz,01/08/2023,"We have not been able to use it. Our case: we entered without problem, since the illuminated sign at the entrance said ""FREE"", which was not true and all the places were occupied (good initiative, but very small PAC). No one answered the consultation intercom available to be able to leave. In the end we slept peacefully in the free 24-hour parking lot with a limitation of 6 meters"
27261,3049507,3,tintinisa53,31/07/2023,Clean and well equipped area. 10€ per night. Secured by cameras. On the other hand very noisy because next to the very busy road and the automatic watering system which woke us up at 3am by watering the motorhome! (location 9 to avoid!)
27261,3045633,5,casaoliv,30/07/2023,"Perfect place, easy to find. Everything is here, there is a pub behind, I think there is a toilet and a little shopping."
27261,3045403,5,Jesusvalde77,30/07/2023,"To all that my colleagues have written, just add that you have to pay when you enter the area and not when you leave."
27261,3038206,5,franrokarim20,29/07/2023,Magnificent area. €10/24h with electricity included. There are two complete positions for filling and emptying. One of the best areas where we have been. There is a lot of green area around and the center can be reached by taking a fantastic walk along the river. Very easy to access the area with the AC.
27261,3034398,5,sabimenendez,28/07/2023,Very well located and very comfortable. Too bad it doesn't have twice the capacity.
27261,3026450,4,Tipso,26/07/2023,Great pitch to visit Pamplona. Thanks to the city! Pamplona is really worth seeing! The pitch offers a lot. What we didn't find are toilets and showers ;-)
27261,3022147,5,AndamosMochileando,26/07/2023,"We love this area, it has all the services in duplicate for only €10. The center of Pamplona is a 10/15min walk away, where you can eat outrageously. Thank you Pamplona for thinking about this type of tourism and keeping the facilities like this!"
27261,3021366,5,saradedo,26/07/2023,"Difficult to find a place but if you can it is the ideal place to spend one / two nights and visit the city. 10/15 minutes from the center on foot. We arrived late and still found a place, I recommend arriving late in the morning if possible, even the electricity is there for everyone. Maybe some stay a little further away but with the usual extension cords no problem. 24h/10€. We felt very safe."
27261,3021205,5,xavieronava,25/07/2023,We have been there for two days and it has been very practical because you have the essentials in terms of services and the location is very good with respect to the center. There is a public elevator that avoids having to walk up the steepest part. It is also well controlled by those responsible for the city council.
27261,3019937,4,Antyasun,25/07/2023,"Almost perfect AC area, you pay €10/day, you can stay for 48 hours, quiet area. Walking to the center 15 minutes away, the only thing is that the bins are full and they don't empty them (it's because of the bad effect that makes seeing them full) we were sticky to one, although there is garbage at the exit of the Area. Above all, check if there is a space before entering because you pay and if there is no room then you have to leave and to get the €10 back, a bit of a hassle"
27261,3013155,5,camusTetV,24/07/2023,ideal for visiting the city. near a roundabout and a b service station which is an express crossroads every day. 10€/24h
27261,3009584,5,AlexC.1975,23/07/2023,"Excellent for visiting the city for one night (24h € 10 including electricity and loading and unloading services. There are not many places, less than 40 but there is always someone who leaves ... usually after lunch is the best time. What else to say, with a 20-minute walk you are in the heart of Pamplona."
27261,3006477,5,Jontxu78,23/07/2023,"We have slept very well, with electricity included €10.... There is always someone who goes through everything and takes out a table, chairs, etc.... By the way, I attest that they fine cars and vans that are not housing, the one in front of us €60"
27261,3004427,5,berlisendaxtr,22/07/2023,"Perfect near the center to visit, near the train park to go with children, gas station with mini-supermarket next door, there are wooden tables. We stayed for a day and we saw the entire center. It seems perfect to me that they control the maximum time 48h so we avoid people settled. They can also denounce you if they want according to the norm if you are not a housing tourism."
27261,2999033,5,chimoines,21/07/2023,"area close to the city, very quiet. just the bad luck of arriving last and finding all the sockets occupied"
27261,2997600,5,PeterPanCar,21/07/2023,Very well located. 10 minutes walk from the center of Pamplona. It is very close to a gas station with a small supermarket. We were lucky to get a place in San Fermines. The nights were calm.

27261,2991626,5,jawel33,20/07/2023,"a beautiful well-equipped car park there is everything, we are not far from the village we did it by bike it's great, small river nearby to get your feet wet, the night at 10 € is very correct, afterwards you can miss a catch to have doubled with the neighbor, very friendly because it was complicated otherwise I recommend."
27261,2976654,5,arantxabcn,17/07/2023,"The area is super good, very well located to visit the city, 15 min walk to the center. Water, electricity and recycling. It is guarded, they pass by from time to time. To have some good pintxos with a wine, we recommend Bar Fitero Estafeta."

27261,2961765,3,familiacanaria,14/07/2023,"well located for san fermines. concert music is heard but not too much. services ok. But if you park on a corner, the power cable doesn't reach you or they aren't free. What I did not like is that the enclosure is used to block the way for people on the street since it has another entrance on foot on the opposite side of the barrier."
27261,2950104,3,valetio,11/07/2023,EYE! Only suitable for some campervans and motorhomes. Look at the type of vehicle in the technical sheet: (1000 tourism) not suitable. 60 euros fine and removal by crane. Otherwise close to the city center and all the amenities around.
27261,2938410,5,Pedrocop,08/07/2023,"Ideal place to see the downtown area, with all the services and a gas station next door, where you can buy, yes, do not spend more than 48 hours parked, you will be fined."
27261,2931321,4,flo.treguier,06/07/2023,"well located and well supervised area. The price is higher than indicated, currently 20/day but maybe just during the San Firmin celebrations? the area is closely watched by the municipal police who come about every two hours. Free riders do not escape, nor do the intruders .... ultimate precision no problems with an 8.30 mt.."
27261,2924312,4,ruedines,04/07/2023,"I give it 4 stars for not having Walter but it's very good. I went with the car of 7'20 and without problems, in the payment of €10 per night the light enters"

27261,2868548,4,Macu11,18/06/2023,"Very good located area, close to the old town. Behind it is a gas station with an express Carrefour that opens every day. There is a broken socket, but we were able to share the electricity by putting a thief with the motorhome next door."
27261,2867428,4,La_tortugueta,18/06/2023,"Well located area, it is true that at night people pass by in the middle of the area shouting, it looks safe and at a good price, electricity included, gray water drain and well-arranged load, very pleasant walk next to the river at 3 minutes, the center of Pamplona a 10-minute walk away, to glue the plugs to and some broken, otherwise fine."
27261,2865752,3,Romu47,18/06/2023,Area well located near the center but awakened several times in the night by the noisy passage of young people. We couldn't get electricity because a socket was faulty. There is no catch for everyone. and the price is the same for all.
27261,2864628,1,anasaffy,17/06/2023,We stop and it turns out that after paying €10 for a day we cannot connect to the light because the connectors are broken….
27261,2821702,3,ccct,05/06/2023,"Good place, clean and ok to walk to the town.
For us it is not conveniently located, it is noisy, next to the fire station on one side, a homeless shelter on the other with young people sitting outside chatting and drinking most of the night, also next to a very busy road.
We think it would have been better to park on the other side of the road."
27261,2812154,4,shinobitrekking,02/06/2023,Great location for visiting the city and close to the old citadel of Pamplona. Great.or for those with bicycles or strollers. Reasonable cost spacious and quiet at night. Busy during the day. advised. Parking in the free case in front if the area is full
27261,2809506,5,Costablanca,01/06/2023,"Good place to leave the motorhome if you are going to visit Pamplona. €10 with electricity seems like a reasonable price to me, it's a pity that you can only stay for two days because this city well deserves one more day. Thanks to the Pamplona city council for having this detail with which we came by motorhome to see this beautiful city."

27261,2764750,3,josmallbones,19/05/2023,"Very handy for visiting the town, although get there early because it fills up by 4pm. They have a overly complicated and confusing procedure for leaving which caught many out. Also youths hanging around late at night we didn’t feel threatened as have a dog as did many of the vans, theres also regular police & municipal patrols along with cctv. It’s a good site for a one night stopover."
27261,2763889,3,CamperSchneider,19/05/2023,The automatic license plate recognition and the invoice comparison did not work when leaving. Assistance via operator was necessary.

27261,2746611,5,cali04,13/05/2023,"Great AC area, well located, water services, discharge and light sockets very well done for a price of €10 for 24 hours.

27261,2744054,4,Fabrice7868,12/05/2023,The area is ideally located for visiting the city (15 minutes walk from the center). To know ; there are not as many electrical connections as there are parking spaces. Place a bit noisy in the morning because near a busy road but quiet night.

27261,2735270,3,cosne,08/05/2023,it's true that it's not too badly placed to visit the center 10 euros with all services it's correct the most unpleasant thing is the proximity to the streets which are far too close it's 10 p.m. and the traffic is still very important I don't know how the night will be
27261,2733916,1,JohnOConnor,08/05/2023,"One star , sign said spaces , none available, took over 30 minutes to get out . No one answering phones or intercom."

27261,2712305,1,Suco75,01/05/2023,"During the day the benches are occupied by drunk homeless people. They don't do anything, but I don't want my kids around. The barriers fail a lot and the payment system is not very intuitive. I would only go in here if I need electricity or carry water. Right in front there is a free 24-hour parking lot, the free one is much better."
27261,2694154,5,Gian1960,24/04/2023,"super parking for visiting Pamplona, €10 with electricity, excellent drain, a bit of trouble getting out, it said I hadn't paid, I pressed the button and the operator replied within seconds who confirmed the payment and the barrier opened. advise"

27261,2684664,5,nathpierre4960,21/04/2023,enter then you pay 10 euro for 24h with 16 amps. No problem for the night. with or without wedges. great to spend a night

27261,2682134,5,Dauvan,19/04/2023,"Wonderful place to visit Pamplona and spend a quiet night. If they have an extension cord for electricity, better. When we left, the barrier did not read the license plate correctly, it told us that we had not paid, but we hit the contact button (they are 24 hours a day), the girl checked it instantly and we left without a problem. A stay and a service of ten!"
27261,2680576,5,joke64,19/04/2023,"No complaints about this motorhome. Learned that it is useful if you have an extension cable and / or adapter with you because 1 connection was defective. Wonderful, explored the entire center and surroundings by bike. In the evening it is also quiet. Recommended. Small disadvantage, you have to be on time, we had the last place the day before yesterday (at 6 pm)."
27261,2664294,2,jfnat,12/04/2023,"Following a comment where it is said that there are only 10 spaces and only 5 electrical outlets, this is not true, there are about forty pitches and electrical outlets all over the area, the all 10 euros with services included"
27261,2662933,1,Caroline50,11/04/2023,area where we easily enter the barrier rises we went around and no place and way to get out without paying 10 euros so we are two motorhomes in this situation. so we decide to stay on a location that does not only bother the person who leaves a comment before me to call the service to get us fired and no way to get a refund.
27261,2662325,4,AdriaPGX,11/04/2023,"Advice is get here early, rather than late! We arrived noon and returned from the town after sightseeing and the site was full but more kept arriving 5pm/6pm and park in the alleyway around the site, not respecting the limits of the pitches and preventing early leaving tomorrow by blocking access. And they try to branch off electricity supply to other motorhomes, that got here earlier in the day."
27261,2658607,5,CathDan40,10/04/2023,Nice motorhome area for 10€/24h. We did not find any free areas (for a van of only 6m) to be so close to the city center. Traffic noise from 6 o'clock in the morning.

27261,2638027,4,fan_chuan,03/04/2023,"A good pitch that meets all the requirements for visiting the city center. The tech. Solution with check in/out could do with better operator guidance, the 3/8"" water connection is unusual. Rather unsuitable for people sensitive to noise. We especially liked the proximity to the city, we felt safe. In the evening the place is often occupied."

Would recommend not parking near the picnic benches at the garage end as young men hang around smoking and drinking - we moved to the other side. €10 for the night including electric. A bit noisy with traffic but great location for walking up into the old town which is beautiful and only a 10 minute walk. Would recommend. Thank you.
27261,2617765,5,Chrislan_at,20/03/2023,"We have spent 2 nights in Pamplona. The first, as the area was full, we went to the free parking lot in front.

Thanks to the town hall for the area"
27261,2525703,5,PatitodeGoma2,21/12/2022,Perfect area to visit the center of Pamplona; It is paved and more or less level (depending on the place chosen). They are €10/day with water and electricity and you pay at an ATM located at the entrance to the area.
27261,2521360,4,funacoshi,14/12/2022,"Quiet, maintained, 1km from the center, perfect for visiting Pamplona. The filling of water is €2, the rest is free."
27261,2521276,4,ealonsoa75,13/12/2022,"Area very well located, 10 min. from the old town. Quiet but a bit noisy. To put a snag, it does not have electrical outlets for all the seats. The area is small for the great demand it has."
27261,2519823,5,LurtaAlaia,11/12/2022,"Since 1148 does not come out, I had to call the municipal office because the person at the intercom insisted that vans could not spend the night in the area. The agent asked me for personal and vehicle data and he assured me that home cars can also spend the night in the Iruña area."
27261,2519298,4,karine85,11/12/2022,"Very nice area, 10€ with 16A electricity, close to the road so noisy. Arrival Saturday 7 p.m. there were 3 places available, this morning 11 a.m. many places available."
27261,2517835,5,sanchez.mercado,09/12/2022,"We could not enter, being full. The barrier does not warn that it is full. It has all the services. We went right in front of the parking lot with a lot of space on the sand without any service"
27261,2516017,1,JuttaPecsi,08/12/2022,"Great to see the city, but when the supports are extended, for standing up straight, for sleeping. If you get a ticket with 68.-€ For us an outrageous rip-off!!!"
27261,2515899,4,layottes,08/12/2022,ideal location and all services on site. It's in the middle of town so quite noisy.
27261,2511091,5,Wasosky,02/12/2022,Excellent. Leveled 100 m from the center. We spent a super quiet night
27261,2509479,5,MarieSence,30/11/2022,very nice location 10 minutes from the city recommend
27261,2506476,5,lamacarena,26/11/2022,"Easy access, don't get near the gas station, there are degenerates. Super fast and good access, quiet area €10 24 hours with electricity, gray water change and water filling. FANTASTIC"
27261,2504795,5,electronicaoscar,24/11/2022,"Area very well located, automated with all services. bus stop a few meters away. And close to the old town. It is to recommend."
27261,2503481,5,Ohanaviajando,23/11/2022,We have already been there twice and it is super clean and quiet to be able to rest.
27261,2501613,5,drsvt,21/11/2022,"Thanks to Pamplona City Council. Area ideally positioned, 10 minutes from the city, with all services. This area is very busy, the parking spaces being large enough to be quiet."
27261,2499722,5,LilyfreeDom,19/11/2022,"Ideally located, near the city center. Clean and convenient. Thanks to the city"
27261,2497863,5,Lemarelta,17/11/2022,"very good place to spend a safe night in Pamplona. It was full the first night and we went to the parking lot across the street (deterrent). The next day, we went to the area. Perfect."
27261,2492809,5,Piltrafilla,12/11/2022,"Congratulations to the city council of Pamplona for the maintenance of the area and service, there was a breakdown of the electrical panel, preventing the connection of 6 vehicles, and at 1:30 in the morning they went to fix it. Thanks."
27261,2488958,4,dedo,09/11/2022,Everything is said in the previous comments. Little advice do not park at the back towards the tables. They are busy at night and you can hear the conversations.
27261,2483284,1,FurgOhana,05/11/2022,"We are here right now. Beware of all the vehicles that do not have the numbers 2448, 3148, 3200, 3248, 3300 or 3348 on their technical sheet. It has cost us a €60 fine when we have everything approved in the van, just because those numbers do not come out. (they have it at the end of everything on a poster and at 01:30 a.m. Q arrived it was not visible). We had paid our €20 and we have to remove her from here."
27261,2483274,5,Esprimwel,05/11/2022,"complete area, neat and clean. the services are very good and in 15 minutes you are in the old town on foot."
27261,2473618,5,isabelbaia,31/10/2022,I stayed two nights and perfect. Thanks to the Pamplona City Council.
27261,2473229,4,Störti01,31/10/2022,Yes the manhole cover... spent one night here and it was reasonably quiet if it wasn't for the manhole cover. But this pitch is recommended if you want to visit the city. Which is definitely worth it.
27261,2467958,5,Ventus737,29/10/2022,"Good location to visit the city. Clean, quiet, well organized. All services work perfectly. Safe, close to the local police and fire department. Many thanks to the city council of Pamplona."
27261,2462704,4,martes40,26/10/2022,"Area very well placed to visit the city on foot with services and suitable price for 24 or 48 hours. But all the drawbacks of the city, located along 2 boulevards, non-stop traffic, manhole cover that makes noise with every car..."
27261,2460886,5,Pachulitos,24/10/2022,"Good location and great services, very clean and quite reasonable price (10 euros 24 hours). We arrived around 6:00 p.m. and there were few places available. They only allow 48 hours maximum and you can't park again for a week. Easy access."
27261,2456753,5,izasisa,22/10/2022,"We spent one night and did not notice any noise at all (perhaps because we were in the area farthest from the entrance). Very accessible both on foot to the center (there is also an elevator that goes up to the city center in about 10 minutes), by bicycle (although access to the center is uphill), and if not, by bus at the roundabout next to the area. The area filled up and kept marking CLEAR."
27261,2455250,4,Awol,21/10/2022,"Perfect spot with wide pitches to visit the old town.
Only thing is the manhole cover out in the street making noises."
27261,2453954,4,HenrikMertens,20/10/2022,Adequate parking but at a good price. For €10 you can stand for 24 hours including electricity. Simply enter the number plate at the machine. We are around 4.30pm in low season! Arrived and still the place was almost full. By 5:00 p.m. all seats were taken - so it's better to arrive a little earlier.
27261,2446124,4,DenisePhilipson,16/10/2022,"Busy aire full by 5pm. Lot of traffic noise but close to city center and parks to walk dogs close by. Also dog park along river. 
Electric included in 10euro."
27261,2441683,4,val17500,13/10/2022,"Arrive before 11 a.m. to ensure seats are available. Prefer the back of the parking lot because there is a manhole on the road which emits noise with each passage of cars. The city center is 10 minutes walk. To get out, drive the camper van right up to the barrier in order to be clearly identified. The area is very interesting to discover the city and its parks. We will return."
27261,2437473,4,campervancastaways,11/10/2022,"Barrier entry Aire, marked tarmac bays, good dump/fresh area, pay at pay machine for parking before exiting. Pamplona actually really nice, big city within 10 mins walk from the Aire. Practical, functional and full on our visit."
27261,2426629,3,Misterfel,06/10/2022,"Near the center, electricity included. Few places, very noisy due to the traffic (and the sewer that moves) and the homeless people in the center right next door who have direct access to the area and use the tables at night. A pity that it is so small for Pamplona and so noisy (fire station next door). Somewhat tilted."
27261,2425901,4,abeille79200,05/10/2022,Well located to visit Pamplona the city center is 20 minutes walk away a little traffic around 6:00 a.m. cycle paths in the area to remember for a next trip by cc
27261,2418300,4,CarolinHintz,02/10/2022,"Very good place to stay for one night if you want to visit Pamplona, 10 minutes walk to the old town. Secured (barrier cameras), quiet, in the park next door there is a clean public toilet and a nice pump trail. Well visited. we stayed 24 hours and took full advantage of this in the city."
27261,2413097,3,HymerVanStan,30/09/2022,"Good for visiting Pamplona. TIP: Do not park next to picnic area. People from homeless centre next door sit there drinking and chatting until all hours of the morning. Entry and exit system has major problem with non-Spanish vehicle number plates, so expect delays when leaving."
27261,2408269,3,ManuelS1953,27/09/2022,"The area is very nice, if it wasn't for a manhole cover that is on the street just before you enter the area. I called the phone number for help, to tell them about it and that they will call the town hall, and a lady tells me that it is not their problem, that I call the town hall and that I make the complaints."
27261,2407464,4,LaGazelle74,27/09/2022,value for money nothing to complain about. don't hesitate to come before noon because afterwards it's hard to have room even in this season. 10 euros tt included 10 mins from the center
27261,2406551,3,merco80,27/09/2022,"We had to leave the car park very early in the morning because from 5am there were young people with beer and Moroccan cigarettes. too much noise, they were urinating between the motorhomes. The municipality has provided tables around the CC air, too bad that its use is negative.."
27261,2400601,5,ChristelDobbelaere,24/09/2022,"Visited place on 08/09/22, stayed 2 nights. Excellent motorhome with all amenities, spacious pitches, everything very neat and within walking distance of the center. Recommended!"
27261,2395175,5,HeKl,22/09/2022,Super place for a maximum of 2 days sightseeing. Very well located and good value. Well visited.
27261,2393881,4,smc999,22/09/2022,"Very busy, good facility’s for vanmin and walking distance into town."
27261,2382450,4,Isamar,18/09/2022,"In favor, the proximity to the center. Crossing the park opposite, you come to an elevator that takes you to the top and, if not, the slope of Avda. de Guipúzcoa is easy even for a lazy person like me. The price is very good, since it includes even electricity. Against the size of the squares."
27261,2380938,3,BGMobil,17/09/2022,"We got to the barrier around 3pm. The ad said LIBRE, so free. However, the place was already fully occupied. It is very annoying and risky that at this point you have to drive backwards onto the busy road or have to back other motorhomes. It is also not clear that there is a free place directly opposite in case of need. Great uncertainty."
27261,2379548,1,AmaiaLdeH,17/09/2022,"We arrived at the area at 11:20 p.m., they put up the free parking sign (there were spaces...), you approach and the barrier opens. we parked behind a van and paid the €10. you wake up and a €60 fine for parking outside the defined lines. In front of the area, there is a free parking lot where a lot of motorhomes have spent the night for free and without a fine. A shame! I will not come back!"
27261,2377654,5,Alexmue,16/09/2022,"Super place, it is checked how long the WoMos are, 2 days allowed. Really clean place, all places with electricity and enough space to the neighbors. Very close to the city, and with 10 € a night TOP. Ver. Disposal available and clean."
27261,2365266,5,MatyHerrera,12/09/2022,"Perfect place to visit the old town, only a ten minute walk away. You can only stay a maximum of 48 hours, it has gray and black water. Light is included in the price. highly recommended"
27261,2363166,5,omega800,12/09/2022,"Great place to visit the old town. We were on September 8th. there and got caught in a parade where felt all of Pamplona and the surrounding area celebrated. Visiting the bullfighting arena is a must!! The place itself has everything you need, a bit noisy due to the immediate location on the street but completely ok in the middle of the center"
27261,2357294,5,BartTheFoxx,10/09/2022,"Great motorhome near the center. Ideal to visit the city. Electricity and water are included in the 10€/24h. Instructions for registering at the parking meters are clear, but I couldn't find how to switch languages on the machine itself (may have been me). Pitches are almost all a bit crooked, so wedges are welcome."
27261,2357225,3,laphilani,10/09/2022,very good to visit but very noisy at night
27261,2352710,5,egehin,08/09/2022,we've been here twice and it's always practical and well thought out 2 steps from the city
27261,2352669,5,lebronjames2306,08/09/2022,Paid parking space with all services.
27261,2350388,4,windalo,08/09/2022,"Thanks Pamplona, very good place and with plugs. It seems like a fair price to me and with the Telpark application you can register. Lots of car noise and a rattling sewer the only flaw."
27261,2348610,5,Boesche,07/09/2022,"Great pitch, was fully booked today. We were lucky. Despite the proximity to the road, we had a quiet night. Great walks along the river possible. Very suitable for dogs. Very well connected to the city center by elevator. A few minutes walk"
27261,2340336,5,niamhf97,05/09/2022,"Fantastic location with great facilities (electric, water and waste) just a 15 minute walk from the old town of Pamplona. Arrived at 7pm on a Sunday evening and there were plenty of spaces available. €10 for 24 hours. Lovely picnic tables on site and service station next door. Highly recommend!"
27261,2338726,3,neki9,04/09/2022,"It's ok there aren't many places but it's quite new, there is a payment light. There is no shade at all. Next door is a gas station with a small express Carrefour at the gas station"
27261,2337085,5,Cezar,04/09/2022,"Security, comfort all the services available to recommend Bravo to the city"
27261,2325878,5,philoumilou,31/08/2022,"Visited August 19, 2023. €10 for a location near the city center. Ideal even if the CC are key key. A word of advice, come early, the barrier opens even if the campsite is full! Many CC go around to leave. It's poorly made and the only downside. Secure bike path to town."
27261,2320837,5,elinecl,30/08/2022,"Secure motorhome parking on the edge of town. Ideal base to explore the city, less than 15 minutes walk. By the evening the parking was almost full, is not a place to chill at your motorhome..."
27261,2318070,5,PeterHueber,29/08/2022,Very neat pitch. For fresh water you need a 1/2 inch adapter.
27261,2317752,4,Titi_Bibi27,29/08/2022,"Perfect place to visit the old town...a bit noisy given the proximity of two major arteries but it is bearable...indicate that it is only parking for 24 or 48 hours maximum, in this period you cannot leave with the vehicle and you can no longer access the premises during the week."
27261,2313216,5,Fernandomi16,28/08/2022,"A wonderful area. We arrived in the afternoon and there was plenty of room. Above with light and very well located to reach the center, both on foot and by bus."
27261,2311015,4,bisbal10,27/08/2022,"Great area to spend the night. €10/24h. Central, just 10 minutes walk from the Plaza del Castillo area where you can taste good tapas. The only ""but"", that in the area of the central island there are not enough power outlets for the number of motorhomes that can spend the night."
27261,2309690,5,PedroMalho,27/08/2022,"great place, but if full, the Parking across the road if FREE com overnight stay very big."
27261,2307456,4,judithacha,27/08/2022,"Good area with all the services, very close to the center on foot and a gas station, medium-sized squares with an entry and exit barrier, you pay at the machine and you need a 3 adapter for electricity, which is included, you can't get anything, but you have picnic tables."
27261,2303925,1,BibiCino,26/08/2022,"Parking area for motorhomes and campers only, not for vans equipped for camper use. We left the van paying the 10 € ticket as requested but on the way back we got a 60 € fine. In a month around the north of Spain this was the only paid parking lot we used and after this bad experience we strongly recommend everyone to continue sleeping in the free parking lots in order not to contribute to the economy of these city administrations than with a hand they offer you services and with the other they steal your wallet."
27261,2301722,4,gabrielehelene,25/08/2022,"Ideal place to visit Pamplona and also spend an evening in the old town. The way to the old town is within walking distance. The service facilities are good. Arriving on time is good, otherwise everything might already be full."
27261,2296577,5,eska81,24/08/2022,Fantastic place.
27261,2296253,4,marcangouleme,24/08/2022,"Very good area well equipped but also very busy. 10 euros per day which is very reasonable. The arenas are worth the visit and allow you to discover a little bullfighting art. On the other hand, compared to the rest of Spain, Pamplona is dirty and poorly maintained, as is often the case in the Spanish Basque country. The city center is nothing really remarkable."
27261,2290319,4,maitellan,23/08/2022,"Perfect for visiting downtown. complete services and in good condition. nothing noisy, except for the noise of the night watering of the green areas that surround the area. and wet whatever is within reach. don't leave anything out."
27261,2288301,5,crisisaacxevi,23/08/2022,Ideal place to spend the night. Hos I recommend entering at 9 in the morning is when there is room if you enter in the afternoon surely you will not find. Always free since for €2 and a maximum of 45 min you can fill water and empty. 15 min walk from the old town. Right in front there is a very large car park but I don't know if it is paid. There is a pam track and green area for dogs right next to it
27261,2287732,5,bbragado,23/08/2022,Very good area located very close to the center of Pamplona. We arrived around 6.30 and were able to park. Area with private surveillance at night passing within the area that at least gives more peace of mind. Very clean. With AC >7m. A great park attached to an incredible skate circuit for kids.
27261,2286231,4,PascalSainz,22/08/2022,Parking near the city center 20 minutes walk. Possibility to make water and empty waste water for free if you stay less than 45 minutes. Otherwise 10 euros for 24 hours with electricity. Now you have to like being parked… Very good for the day now free parking in front!

27261,2243593,2,Marclashter,15/08/2022,"We have been one night, in the free parking lot in front, quite full of motorhomes, there are no containers, only a trash can at the entrance, very dirty because of those who throw everything away, including toilet paper and people unfolding tables and chairs and with clothes hanging everywhere, a bad image for the whole group. It is flat and few trees."
27261,2232902,2,ggsola,14/08/2022,Nice until the police came and told us to leave. Since we were invading the no parking zone. Despite the fact that we could fit 2 caravans without problem since the barrier also allowed entry when putting FREE.
27261,2232753,5,rkrjacint,13/08/2022,"You have to be thankful that the city puts up a site for cars. Even if it says free, you have to check that it is not full since it always says Free in case you want to empty it. €2 45 minutes."

I parked on the side to move it in the morning out of the parking spaces and at 01:00 I was fined. So do not park outside the area, and the small vans should respect that it is a motorhome area..."
27261,2175313,5,xavihymer,04/08/2022,Excellent area to be able to visit the city quietly. It has surveillance cameras and the police are seen from time to time. At night it is somewhat noisy.

Camera controlled barrier with registration recognition which let's you in, but even after you've paid we watched lots of people having to use the intercom to get out, including us. Sits beside two busy roads so a little noisy, but slept well. Very convenient for the old town and parks."

27261,2038745,3,Medusasessina,04/07/2022,"Perfect place to visit the center... very noisy... indicate that it is only parking for 24 or 48 hours maximum, in that period you cannot leave with the vehicle and you cannot access the premises again within a week."

27261,1964954,5,micky57,10/06/2022,Well designed area and close to the old center. Having electricity is a plus. It is better to arrive early to be sure of having a place (June) To recommend without reservation
27261,1957349,5,MZech,07/06/2022,Great location to visit the city (walking distance). Gas station and public restroom are nearby and two picnic tables are available. For the price again (10 € including electricity).

27261,1928027,4,AlexisMari,29/05/2022,"Not all of them have a power outlet. I arrived yesterday at 8:30 p.m. and the 6 shots that I had nearby were all occupied. Fairly quiet, and space is fine. You have a meter and a half left on each side."
27261,1924897,5,RaphaTxl,28/05/2022,"For a camp ground in a city this was a total (positive) surprise! Clean, all necessary facilities, relatively quiet during the night, and with video surveillance.

Convenient unloading area but not very clean. 20 € for 48 hours with electricity"

27261,1877170,3,Calimero125,08/05/2022,"This area is really convenient for visiting the historic center. Two lanes for services. Despite this, the incessant traffic on the boulevard and the narrowness of the pitches make the night less comfortable."

27261,1847674,4,porsedenmark,23/04/2022,Great space in a great location. Everything within walking distance and Pamplona is definitely worth a visit! The only reason we are only giving it 4 stars is because of the noise at night. The space is right next to a car wash which is noisy until late evening. Choose spaces away from the car wash :-) otherwise great. Stayed for one night!
27261,1846836,5,ParkStar,22/04/2022,"Easy access to the center and electricity and water included. Upon arrival at 4 pm there were some free places, but at 9 pm there are only one"
27261,1844073,4,Quim-Gisela,21/04/2022,"Very well. Ideal to visit the old part. €10 for 24h with electricity, filling and emptying. Of course, if you leave within 24 hours, the place is not saved, you may find yourself having paid, outside, waiting for someone to leave. Better not do it. Otherwise great."
27261,1830766,4,baikal,17/04/2022,"We arrived on 4/12/2022 at noon and it was already almost full. We spent the night of the 13th there and, despite being a place near the center and with two avenues next to it, the night was quiet. The problem is that it is too small. The center is reached by following the course of the river and taking the Las Dominicas elevator (free)."
27261,1823320,1,Kali78,15/04/2022,"Well signposted parking, discharge of gray water and electricity for €10/24h. Very close to the Old Town. But we were surprised by the free parking sign, you enter and it's full, and to leave you have to pay €10. We called to ensure the places and they told us ""no problems"" it never fills up. LIE! We stay, there are 3 AC same situation, and in the morning surprise. €60 fine."
27261,1821187,3,ourworldheritage,14/04/2022,"Close to the city and handy that there is electricity. Wasn't bothered by the traffic noise. Didn't use any other services, so we can't report on that."

27261,1803092,5,Josla,01/04/2022,"A very well-kept, beautifully landscaped place, in the immediate vicinity of many green areas. Walk to the cathedral and old town 1.2 km. Large food market about 500 m, many restaurants nearby. Payment either by credit card or with euro coins. Street is noisy and busy during the day. Ideal for sightseeing."
27261,1799741,3,wkelly,29/03/2022,Good site with good facilities and a good location. But it’s right by a roundabout with dual carriageways so the road noise is constant and worse from early morning.
27261,1795908,5,titidu64100,26/03/2022,Excellent value for money (10€/24h)! 10 minutes walk from the historic center. The area is very clean and functional. Please note that parking is limited to 48 hours. The only downside is that you can hear the road a little!
27261,1793571,2,pticlod,24/03/2022,"just practical for visiting the city. the services are clean. it is certainly not a camper van that designed this area. parking limited to 48 hours (but who would want to stay with such traffic noise?? this morning malfunction of the exit barrier. there were 10 of us wanting to leave and we waited 3/4 hour before being able to leave, apparently it's a recurrent issue"
27261,1791745,5,Citijo,22/03/2022,"Functional area, well placed to visit the city, we advise you to discover the restaurant El Horno De Aralar, the noise of the cars did not bother us."
27261,1790742,3,dupi24,21/03/2022,"Convenient for visiting the city which we found very pretty, 4 g ok. Pitch not very big so we had to unhitch the trailer. Close to the road. Avoid the ready locations of picnic tables which are not used for cc but for people who seem homeless."
27261,1787322,1,dref59,19/03/2022,"The area is adjacent to a very close and very busy road, if you are a weak sleeper then go your way, it is in no way worth the 10€ you sleep on the road. Certainly convenient to get to town, but after a sleepless night !!! Plus, you're glued to your horrible neighbors!!!"
27261,1785458,4,bkb,17/03/2022,"Clean area and close to the old center. There is traffic during the day but at night it is quiet. All services for 10€/24h. 48 hours max and if you leave the car park, you won't be able to come back for a week. Payment at the machine. Sorting bins. Walk arranged on the banks of the Arga. Magnificent historic center. The visit to the cathedral alone is worth the detour."
27261,1785381,4,Bourlingueurs,16/03/2022,Clean place and close to the old town. Noisy during the day but the night was still good. Small difficulties to leave the area. Capricious barrier. Thanks to the city.
27261,1784362,1,DominicRuehl,15/03/2022,"Place is almost between 3 main roads, at a roundabout. Loud without end. And otherwise as always. Sardines that are close together. One likes it, we hate it."
27261,1781097,1,hogler,12/03/2022,"17:00 barrier opens, although all parking spaces are occupied. I hope they don't charge for the tour. The fire brigade with free parking spaces is right in front of it. Is much quieter than next to the gas station at the roundabout."
27261,1779262,5,gapa61,10/03/2022,"Beautiful SP near the old town. The place is tidy, well lit and some seating is available. Pulling the ticket and leaving the seat is quite difficult for 85%. Luckily I wasn't the only one having problems. But the beautiful old town makes up for it."
27261,1774877,5,cocosilla,06/03/2022,"Excellent! The area, the services, the location close to the city center, everything! We arrived this Saturday at noon and there were almost no places, it should be bigger. Many cities should have areas like this. Unfortunately, there are people who do not clean the sewage area well. Marmos are everywhere. a pity"
27261,1772234,5,KarenCharman,03/03/2022,the location is as good as people say and €10 for 24hrs all included.  Pamplona has so much to offer so our only problem is that it has a 48 hour maximum with no return within a week.
27261,1771511,5,FranziskaBorgsen,02/03/2022,"A great pitch and a great price, with electricity! You can look at Pamplona very well!"

Bordering a busy road and fire station but you sleep at night. Too bad for the incivility of fake Swiss and German campers who turn on the generators day and night with their 4x4s even if the 220V is free. Some people should be kicked out!"
27261,1752320,5,terryjohnevans,10/02/2022,No complaints here. Very clean and well situated to access the town. Would definitely come back. I recommend 2 days to get a feel for the lovely town. Thank you Pamplona Terry and Linda

To fill with water, take several adapters because the nozzle is smaller than what is normally seen. Quiet and well-kept place. Being close to the homeless facilities in the morning they knocked on the window to ask for money but otherwise it is a fairly safe place attached to firemen. Thank you Pamplona"
27261,1740605,4,Helton,24/01/2022,"Good central location, historic centre a 20 minute walk away.

Downsides are the noise from the road and the odd drug user from the nearby shelter. We found one sat at the rear of our van, no harm done but a bit unnerving."

27261,1723644,3,ferrandf,02/01/2022,The AC area is very good. What is not so good is that one of the buildings that is right next to it is for homeless people. Which is not a problem but the environment outside the building as it was full of drunk and drugged people. Creating noise and fighting. Thing that creates insecurity and fear.
27261,1719472,4,SergioGata,30/12/2021,Very well located area to get to know Pamplona. During the day quite a lot of noise from the surrounding road but at night the noise decreases and you sleep great.

27261,1716670,3,sandrido,27/12/2021,"Camper area with automatic barrier € 10 / 24h in this period. You pay on arrival by entering the license plate number. The exit was a bit difficult because the license plate was not read, perhaps because it was foreign. The area is located next to a road that is quite busy even at night, therefore not very silent. Convenient for visiting the city as a 20 'walk takes you to the center. Convenient loading and unloading."
27261,1713194,5,Chris_L,20/12/2021,"Perfect for a stopover. Very good value for such a central location. Surprisingly quiet at night, although that maybe because it's freezing cold at the moment."

27261,1677842,5,erpreciso,04/11/2021,"Very good location and services. Noisy during the day due to two-lanes roads nearby, however quiet in the night. Pay attention when entering the plate number, the system messes up with non-ASCII characters (e.g., TÜ) but you just call the assistance, spell out the plate, and they open the gate in no time, provide you have the proof of payment."
27261,1674968,5,Schnitti1959,02/11/2021,Really great here! We enjoyed the stopover with many nationalities.

27261,1623129,2,plahs,02/10/2021,Well-equipped place which is unfortunately devalued by the presence of drug and alcohol addicts with their dogs. These meet in groups at the seating area of the parking space and make life difficult for the campers with their loud behavior. You also feel rather unsafe in their presence. The street noise is also annoying at night.

You also have electricity (you need a three-phase adapter). 10 € 24h or you can enter just to change the waters. 10 min walk from the historic center.

I do not agree with how he tells us to park, please recycle and do not throw ""wipes"" with the chemical toilet, it does not dissolve them and clog the emptying of toilets. the telephone management gives to be desired, and although the area is all occupied, the illuminated panel of the area is still FREE. from 8:00 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., about 20 acs entered and left without a place"

27261,1506979,4,gonzalopulido,24/08/2021,"Excellent area near the city, 10 min. walking, be careful with the squares that hit the banks of the area that face the city, they get drunk and drug addicts and they can give you a scare and the night with their screams, and they urinate between the cars and the plants, the rest of very quiet squares."

You have the center at 15 minutes, surrounding a beautiful park and where you can see a part of the wall of Pamplona, you also have the option of taking a bus, the stop is almost in front. If I had a toilet and shower it would already be a 10, but everything is perfect, thanks to Pamplona."
27261,1495036,4,jardinetbcn,22/08/2021,"It is one of the best car parks I have seen, the downside I can give it is that the town hall built it next to a homeless center and they walk through the parking lot drunk and screaming, yesterday there was even a fight between them in the middle of the parking lot in front of all the children. They hang around, they ask you for money and they bother you. Little sight by the city council, they must solve it."
27261,1494831,4,PeppeSaggese,22/08/2021,I don't give 5 stars for lack of shade. The city of Pamplona has made a beautiful camper area complete with two loading and unloading points. Near the center. Close to a playground. Fantastic. Fair value for money

27261,1009616,4,Didiruca06,28/08/2020,"Very good area in Pamplona, With all services including electricity, it's € 10 Close to the center with bike lane. The only downside is that it is not fenced, young people come who stand in the emptying area and load to drink beers and then they do not pick it up. If it were fenced it would be much safer. I said see you on the road and do not forget to say hello."
27261,1008939,5,Focmayeta,28/08/2020,"Very correct area, clean, with water filling services, gray and black water discharge, electrical connection (with three-pole socket), accessible to the center, with a pleasant walk, we walked there are about 1.5 km.

27261,844567,4,luifer,02/07/2020,"The area is very good, the only problem that I saw is that it is not closed and anyone can enter, at around 6 in the morning 3 kids entered some banks that are there and were shouting, eating and drinking next to the motorhome, I think they could avoid it by closing the two entrances, otherwise fine."
27261,841530,2,OlXt3873,29/06/2020,"Area in the city center, 33 spacious pitches, paved, lit and slightly sloping. 10 euros for 24 hours. You register by entering the license plate number, you pay and to exit, there is recognition of the license plate.

27261,781760,4,abuelopablo,17/02/2020,"Very central and convenient for the old town, payment machines dismantled so coins only, benches and tables colonised my amiable homeless people from a nearby refuge smoking weed and drinking beer on the weekend but no problems from them. Chocking needed on most pitches."
27261,778098,3,ophiusito,09/02/2020,"Good location, but there is always a problem. Last time there was no water, this time you cannot pay by credit card. For € 10 24 hours, managers should take a little more care. It is always practically full, from which I deduce that they make a good box. Better service, please!"
27261,777360,3,veromese,07/02/2020,"You can only pay with coins or with the application. It has been like that for a month because of the comments and the card still doesn't work. Luckily they helped me at the nearby gas station. Thanks to the very kind girl. In the parking in front that is for cars they give you a bus trip to the center but in this one that is only across the sidewalk no. The area is fine, although there are more acs outside than inside"
27261,773133,4,ademortier,27/01/2020,Well located area that is worth a detour. Narrow pitches. Not too noisy. Settlement problems with certain cards.
27261,772009,3,eleal,24/01/2020,"Well, neither more nor less. The worst thing that is open and the tables and benches are occupied by young people giving the bottle and beer, would be greatly improved if they were fenced. The light requires three-phase plug. Do not let pay with cash only card. quite safe and close to the center"
27261,768251,4,patxoneta,13/01/2020,"Area with good location to visit the city. Quiet night despite being on an avenue. The charging machines were broken and did not accept cards, only coins. recommendable"
27261,767710,2,Anuskitas,12/01/2020,"Noisy area, attached to the road. When we went, there was no water for failure, which was all sooo dirty: full of wipes, papers ... Of course, the price we had to pay was the same. The emptying of sewage is one meter high which makes it difficult to empty. I imagine that the money (€ 10) paid for 24 hours, should be reflected in the care of the area and it was not."
27261,766243,5,subfiver,08/01/2020,"At 1700hrs we were all alone, but 16 Spanish vans parked around the side of the estación de bomberos and on the road.

Pamplona is a beautiful city with history and many parks. It's worth a visit. The payment is made with 1 euro coins or with the app (see info board). With credit card we had problems."
27261,724636,5,euphenie,18/10/2019,I change my comment because this morning I filled up with water before leaving and I realized that the screw had changed. We no longer have to change the adapter to the lower diameter. A big thank you to the manager of the parking area and good road to all.
27261,723079,5,euphenie,16/10/2019,"Hello everyone, I am there and I confirm that it is a super equipped area and close to the city center. Being a good French, I have 2 remarks to make. the traffic noise and the diameter of the screw thread at the water tap, a small adapter must be provided and tightened very tightly. Other than that, everything is fine and good road?"
27261,720078,5,veral34,13/10/2019,Excellent location and very clean. near the city center on foot.
27261,715103,5,mickpamg,07/10/2019,"An excellent aire with 2 service points.  An easy uphill walk to the centro.  The servo (Carrefour Express) next door has reasonable priced fuel and pump-in LPG.  Getting out once you have paid is a bit of a hassle.  This appears to be a very popular aire it was full to overflowing both nights we stayed.  In fact I counted 24 campers outside on the street and adjacent the fire station, so be early.  I do wish the local authority would send a compliance officer to enforce the motorhomes only rule."
27261,705539,4,mikiriver,26/09/2019,"The same as the previous motorhomeer, if it is full, you remain without ""plugging in"" and they charge you the same."
27261,704367,4,luis17,25/09/2019,"Fine, but if it's complete there are no plugs for electricity for everyone."
27261,701110,3,xgo,22/09/2019,Superbly well-placed area only disadvantage lack of maintenance at the level of the drainers a lot of noise at night with young people until 4am for the rest all is well
27261,697604,5,guytou74,20/09/2019,"Very calm and nothing to complain about. The historic center is less than 10 minutes walk from the gas station and then right after the bridge. 200 m further there is a lift. For my part, I left the bikes."
27261,693915,5,Archelon5,17/09/2019,"For an area in the city, it's not so noisy. Very clean with selective sorting to shame some French towns. Access to downtown by bike out of the area by the gas station and up the ramp while staying on the sidewalk. At the top, take the path that goes through the big park and you're there. The cathedral is beautiful with the enhancement of the cloister and a fantastic ORIGENS exhibition. Do not miss."
27261,693613,3,cath73,16/09/2019,"Area very good and convenient to visit the city but if you can avoid to put you next to the tables, we talk very very late at night in Pamplona !!"
27261,688169,4,LVX655DR,13/09/2019,"Very nice area, for a very affordable price (10 €), all services included with electricity. Located 10 minutes walk or a small quarter of an hour from the historic heart. Iruñea is worth visiting."

27261,683479,1,cokitos,09/09/2019,It is a place that costs a lot of sleep a lot of cars pass and until more than 2 in the morning the thing does not calm down should not cost 10 euros when the rest is null I will not return

27261,673245,4,ISILOG,02/09/2019,"Very good facilities and at a reasonable price since it includes electricity and services. However, it is absurd to indicate a maximum stay of 48 hours and that it can only be renewed AFTER 7 DAYS !!! especially when the available places are almost never occupied. The City Council should cancel that prohibition. I don't give 5 stars for this"
27261,669144,3,emmcosta,30/08/2019,"If the park is too crowded, entry or exit maneuvers are sometimes difficult."
27261,654913,4,Mijina,24/08/2019,"Well connected to the city center. Little shade yet, although there are young trees that will provide shade in the future. Large spaces, an express cart at the gas station next door. Quiet to sleep, although near a road that has a lot of traffic."
27261,640103,3,superfamilyonroad,18/08/2019,"It's fine but the noise of cars at night shows. There are picnic tables. It is very easy to pay. Good option is also to park next door, in the fire station."

Very close to the city center, next to the wall of firefighters gives shade in the afternoon. 48 h 20 euros. Water loading and emptying (45 ') 2 euros. You pay upon entering. We rest very well, traffic noise but not excessive."
27261,572482,1,Albertp_fran,24/07/2019,"It is noisy because it is in the city and very close to the center, but what is unacceptable is that you wake up a truck bomb located in the area of gray water at 8 in the morning to clean, families with small children who have not even been able to sleep. The next time we return here we will move away from this noisy and paid site."
27261,571340,4,viajeroimpenitente,23/07/2019,"Perfect area to visit the city, central, good loading and unloading service and very clean, the only drawback, the proximity to the ring road, although in the most remote places you do not notice much, the price is € 10 for 24 hours, water services € 2.

27261,530231,4,claudiaache,27/06/2019,"The area is central, about 10 minutes from the old town by bike and right next to it there is a gas station and the fire station that gives more security at bedtime. For € 10 you can be 24 hours, fill and drain water and connect to the flow. The only negative is that it is next to the main road and is a bit noisy. For the all very good."

27261,463165,4,elrafaelillo,22/04/2019,"Good and quiet area to visit Pamplona. It is very necessary to explain the payment system better, especially for foreigners. When it arrives, the vehicle is placed on the barrier and the button is pressed, the barrier is opened, parked and the machine is paid for the desired time. To exit, place the vehicle on the exit barrier and with the camera read the license plate and if everything is correct it will open."

27267,2410415,3,Emmer,28/09/2022,"the only really good thing that can be said is that you can stand here to sleep, that it's free and that the area invites you to go for a walk, but the light from the street lamps is massively annoying and the noise from the factory in the valley is just as annoying"

27267,1803806,4,Petos,02/04/2022,"The place is a bit sloping, which is why there were more mobile homes on the straight side of the road. However, we were able to do this well. The square is also extremely well lit, which might be a problem for people who are sensitive to light. The night was quiet for us and the evening walk with our dog between the cow meadow, well-developed paths and the view of the mountains was beautiful."

27267,1766187,1,mrhiperactive,26/02/2022,"In the first place, although at first glance it is well conditioned (and it is appreciated), the bathrooms were not clean. we couldn't use them at night because they suddenly became “out of order”. The second point was that at 4 in the morning a couple of cars came with loud music and it seemed like a disco. Finally the inconvenience of the constant noise from the nearby factory. ."
27267,1758033,4,KatiaEric,17/02/2022,Thank you to the town hall for this area with services which allows you to discover this beautiful city. at the start of a beautiful 9km hike to discover the surroundings. I recommend.

27267,1684675,4,Rasjahcor,10/11/2021,"Despite being a little uneven and giving the feeling of being a little out of the way (we were alone) at night we slept very well and we found the town cool. The police are passing by and on the street next to the area there were several apparently empty AC's, which I imagine will be from residents of the town who park them there and keep company."
27267,1679513,5,nielsloes,06/11/2021,"Perfect place for an overnight stay. It is quiet and from the motorhome you can take fantastic walks. Super! Only drawback, it is difficult to fill water because of the different connection"

The toilets, if we change the diapers for the children, why don't we throw them in the garbage containers instead of throwing them on the floor of the toilets? This is how we are doing."

There is a forest garden next door and a bike lane that took you to infinity !!!! we did 13 km and went on… but we had another 13 left to go back and we couldn't! Bars and Eroski close by and amazing views. The cave which is about 6 kms is worth it. We stayed 2 nights
27267,1502305,4,serparene,23/08/2021,"The site is great. Clean bathrooms, but with hours. The dumpsters are a bit far and there is no normal trash, just recycling. The place is not very flat for some places. It is next to a great park and you can go to town on foot, in less than 10 minutes you are in the Plaza Mayor. Low privacy, the whole town walks through the area. Quite crowded in summer, better to go early for a square."

The terrain is not level and there is no shade. A guy told us that it was not allowed to open the awnings of the AC, that they passed fines. This indication does not appear on the information panel. It seemed weird to me. In fact, a policeman parked in front of us and didn't say anything to us."
27267,1335071,4,Paichi,18/07/2021,"Great place with large squares and all services. The only bad thing is that the natives were in the fresh air at the park tables until after 1 in the morning, talking, taking some beers. Saturday night, I guess that was to be expected ..."

At 7 o'clock in the morning a car passed by whistling as if life were, I suppose the typical bitter ... In the morning we have gone up to Arantzazu and we have made the excursion to the hermitage. There is a lot of unevenness (the information girl told us 300m and I assure you not!) And it is not easy, but it is worth getting to the top, eating something at the hostel and resting in the meadow."
27267,948750,3,Alcasanc,10/08/2020,"Too bad people do not respect the security measures for the covid. The area itself is great. It has picnic tables, sinks, containers and is very close to town. The font is the worst, there is only one and it is used for everything. The day we went it smelled like dog and poop. It is not comfortable to fill waters like this."

The parking is not level, some pitches are worse than others. 
There is a park behind towards the town with picnic benches.
The services are clean but the grey drain is small and you need to be on it or above it for the drain to work. There are recycling bins beside the park.
There is a very clean public toilet more or less automated.
The town is 5mins walk. There are walks in the hills but we tried to walk to Arantzazu but the path through the woods were very mucky and overgrown so we abandoned the idea.
Tourist office in town which is very helpful.
Plenty of bars and cafes in the town."

We paid for 2 people, 2 dogs and parking costs €71.40 (media) for 1 night in a classic pitch. That's why 1 ☆, also because we don't use all the extra services that are offered for 1 night. In addition to being a campsite, it is also a younger camp and glamping / bungalow park."

Older sanitary rooms, but clean. Large plots, be careful of the trees, our camper was totally screwed up after 1 night. Nice beach, very windy. Loud music late into the night. I'm not coming back"

The one on the other side currently does not, but that could change of course! Fairly level in most parts too.

27301,876505,5,abxo,17/07/2020,"Most of the vans are parked on Calle Batiscafo because it is nearer to the village but the larger vehicles park here. I spoke to someone that camps in this village in a camper since 30 years and he said the camper were always accepted in Las Negras but just recently there is a bit of a change to that, the lower parking lot has just gotten a height restriction but this one is still without. He also said it is no longer safe to stay somewhere alone at night, even in this village. Many robberies and break-ins nowadays in Cabo de Gata if you are parked somewhere alone, that’s why he moved back to this lot. But this place he said is still very safe. Showers are on the beach which I also used to refill water with a canister."

The town reflects the Spannish town of old before all the high rises went up and everywhere was concreted over. One of my favourite places in the whole of Spain, shame about the area we are parked in."
27301,618713,3,Leiresfc,11/08/2019,Good place to spend the night. We slept well. Bars nearby.
27301,471793,3,RubCar,30/04/2019,"It is not bad to spend a night, it is an esplanade of earth quite leveled but with mud. There are some caravans and motorhomes that seem to live there."
27301,287364,3,virgipunki,13/07/2018,"For a parking you have a neighborhood feeling because there are caravans that have been there for a long time. The bad thing in the days that I was there is that they are doing a work just in front and they start early with the machines. If you go to the blacks, on the way to the campsite there is a parking spot on the opposite side of the sea, with infinitely better vitas. Las Barcas Restaurant very highly recommended :)"

We had dinner in the next street in the El Brindi Negro restaurant, a very peculiar place with very good food and generous portions, with an unbeatable staff treatment !!! Completely recommended to eat or dine there !!!"
27301,201348,1,borsan,08/10/2017,"That wasteland is the worst place you can find in Black for the night. A little further down, closer to the beach there is a car park with wide squares and trees where you can spend the night without problems. And if not, right next to it, there is a caravan park which is accessed from the access road to the campsite of the Blacks."

27301,81998,3,JMBZ,15/07/2016,"The town is small and charming and does not leave caravans for the people except the parquing of land, which have tolerance, too much because there are people who live here and that is why we are badly seen."
27301,71349,3,Jacomo32,05/05/2016,At the end of April we could spend the night there.
27301,66294,3,hymercamp,26/03/2016,"Parquing of land, next to the town and the beach. Many cars, good for parking and sleeping, but it is just parking. nearby there are much better places, for example the beach of Playazo in Rodalquilar"

27312,368452,3,jcanalitos,09/09/2018,Next to a park where there are restrooms and fountains. Street not very trafficked by vehicles and pedestrians. You are in the center xo you have to walk a little to find stores. Overnight xk we were passing.

For my nasturtium there are many trees on the edge and long I was far out the cranium (6.20m I have) with which I parked in the upper parallel street.

27313,3054194,5,RitaMiranda,31/07/2023,Not a lot of people even on the 31st July. Nice place to park and enjoy the calm of the lake. There's a restaurant/bar with public showers. We didn't spend the night but it must be a very  nice and quiet place to stay.
27313,2748324,4,MikelResa,14/05/2023,"May 14, 2023 we have slept in this place. We have been alone and very calm. It is advisable to find the right place to avoid the parking slope. It only has garbage cans. The source is overridden. The Yacht Club is 50m away and in its parking lot they indicate that overnight stays are prohibited. The nautical bar opens early and has bathrooms. Recommendable."
27313,2497624,4,Quicolas,16/11/2022,"Fantastic place, it's a pity that the reservoir is almost empty and that at 8:00 p.m. they turn off all the lights in the area. Anyway...."
27313,2342131,5,andreaRar,05/09/2022,"Very well located area, next to the reservoir and very close to Ortigosa de Cameros and Rasillo de Cameros. The showers, bathrooms and other services are not operational (the nautical season ends on 08/31). The lower area is flatter and has a small fountain. The weekend is more crowded but you can rest well. In the reservoir is the bar rest. but you have no option for snacks or dinner."

Too many streetlights to see the stars, we were in San Lorenzo. Unnecessary. There were several vans and caravans. Very very spacious, without space problems. There are no toilets, watch out for that. Lots of people during the day on weekends."
27313,1515403,4,Altsasu,26/08/2021,The parking lot is spacious and flat to spend the night but in August there were decent people and a little lack of intimacy can be felt. The place itself is not very pleasant but there is a swamp right next to it and it offers a great opportunity to take a nice bath. There is no service but there is a Club Nautical bar next to the car park.
27313,1389036,5,Nereban,01/08/2021,"Very good place to spend the night quiet, without services, but a lot of space and with a bathing area nearby. Garbage containers next to it, very comfortable"

27313,1304889,4,Jonbis,08/07/2021,"Very quiet place to spend the night escaping from the heat. There is a fountain in the lower area of the parking lot, but today, it has no water. We have spent 4 motorhomes in a very large parking lot."

Wonderful restaurant on the campsite, one of the best in Sitges. Camping shop with fresh bread and many other products. Bus stops in front of the campsite for 4.50 to Barcelona every half hour. A little more noise in the evening on weekends."

27336,2960018,5,MarcusHolmberg,13/07/2023,"Good place to visit Sitges for a couple of nights. Clean with good sized plots. A 15min walk to the beach but they also rent bicycles. The pool area has no beds though, otherwise a nice area"
27336,2944084,5,uliha,10/07/2023,"For us, 4 people and 4 nights with a 7m mobile home, everything was fine! Very friendly family atmosphere, we felt welcome. Also quite cheap for the location and the time of year, around €40/night with ACSI all inclusive. The only downside: partly quite noisy due to the adjacent street. We'll be back anyway, thank you!"
27336,2929545,5,mabrulima,06/07/2023,"100% recommended, very loving staff, a good price, pets allowed, swimming pool, children's play park, restaurant and mini supermarket. We will definitely be back happily"
27336,2914861,5,KatrinX.,02/07/2023,"Just great! Nice big pitches, friendly staff: inside at the reception, supermarket, pool, restaurant. Also very clean sanitary rooms: there is always someone who is cleaning. We felt very comfortable. For €52 for 2 nights for a van without electricity, we also found the price unbeatable. We'd love to come back."
27336,2876549,4,didou34500,21/06/2023,"Calm we appreciated. Just have to trot or bike to get to the beach, small regrets about the lack of hedges at the pitches. No intimacy. But we will be back"
27336,2846113,5,DanielleJerome,12/06/2023,Really nice little campsite. All the staff are very caring. I recommend the restaurant. It early in the choice and quality of dishes. But above all the waitress is awesome. Kind helpful and very attentive to the guests. We will come back??
27336,2817236,5,camperbende,03/06/2023,Everything complete and Sitges surprised us really worth it
27336,2780709,5,Cleptomaniacs,24/05/2023,Nothing to complain about! The restaurant is recommended. You usually need wedges because the surface is not straight. Very nice people at the reception.
27336,2772205,2,bartvan,21/05/2023,Pros: Sanitary is clean and there is a shop and restaurant. Services for motorhome are ok. Including water hose to refill the camper. Beautiful beach boulevard to interesting town at 2.5 km. Downside: you stand on top of each other like anchovies in a tin can and this in the low season! Avoid from May.
27336,2759789,5,DoraII,18/05/2023,"Very friendly welcome. Staff is lovely, nothing is a problem. The facilities are cleaned frequently and showers have hot water and good pressure. Good restaurant and super market. Nice layout with some trees. One minus is that other campers walk over your plot to take a shortcut to the sanitary building. This is possible since there are no physical borders between pitches."
27336,2723391,4,Haddock4485,04/05/2023,"Very clean campsite. Ideal for getting to Barcelona. Bus stop in front of the campsite door and for the return stop just at the roundabout in front of the campsite as well. Very close to Sitges, 15 minutes on foot to get there. The only downside is the equipment is very dusty!!"
27336,2723291,2,BecksnBarry,04/05/2023,"Useful for getting the bus to Barcelona (just outside the gate). The only pitches we were offered were completely in the shade - no good for us as we rely on a solar panel. Lots of empty (sunny) pitches, but were told we couldn’t have them. Lots of permanent residents on the site. Toilets and showers clean. Pool empty so unusable. Useful for Barcelona - but that’s it."
27336,2684793,3,carthevan,21/04/2023,You can only use the services if you sleep there. You can’t just pay for water etc.
27336,2675469,1,exmoblet,16/04/2023,We just came from Marocco and toilets and showers are far more cleaner than on this camping. Can’t recommend.

27336,2661964,3,Nilbert49,11/04/2023,"Quite noisy (traffic), bus to Barcelona just outside the campsite. Lot of long term campers. Minimarket with rather good selection of groceries. Restaurant not  gourmet but ok."
27336,2632476,3,Wildthings,31/03/2023,"Used with ACSI for a day in Barcelona as bus leaves from outside the gate(€4.5 and 1hr). 
The site is tightly packed. We were told that we had the ‘last large pitch’ (pre-booked) as others available were ‘tight’. It was a bit tight but nothing a modestly experienced driver couldn’t manage. An ACSI thing?
facilities were very good; 6A EHU, clean toilets & showers, €5 for the washer, same for dryer."
27336,2625779,5,Reiziger14,26/03/2023,"The price makes sense for a big city. Electricity is an expensive extra. A neat campsite with a shop and restaurant, clean sanitary facilities, filling drinking water is possible. I had noisy youngsters as neighbours, bad luck for me. You can take the bus to Barcelona, 1x per hour for 4.50. Bus information is available at the reception. You get off at Gran Via c. Re-enter Aribau at the same stop where you got off."

27336,2439571,5,elke683,12/10/2022,"Great place to explore Barcelona. The bus leaves right in front of the campsite and for 4.50 euros you can be in the middle of Barcelona in 50 minutes. Where you get off, you get on again... The sanitary facilities are super clean! The atmosphere is very informal and the restaurant is sensationally good for a campsite, although not exactly cheap. The service very, very friendly!"
27336,2436479,4,SENTIER25,10/10/2022,Fairly quiet and clean campsite. Theme nights (queen!!).. a crowded swimming pool.

Perfect reception (also in English), beautiful place under palm trees, sensational place where there is still something going on with a beautiful beach. 62Euro 2P with electricity. Pool is closed but looks nice - we're staying a few more days to see Barcelona."
27336,2427949,5,lebeauserge,07/10/2022,"Very pleasant campsite with very clean sanitary facilities. Supermarket to help out, and have fresh bread in the morning. Ideal for visiting Sitges. I'll be back."

27336,2409662,2,camperfonske,28/09/2022,"This place is open until 16/10, pool already closed. Even though there were many places available and remained free while I was there, it was difficult to get a place. Electricity 7€50 per day this is really about it !!! A household does not cost 225 € the month not even in this crisis !!! WiFi no range at all."
27336,2384405,4,abogado,18/09/2022,"Beautiful, comfortable place, somewhat closed access in the entrance curve. Friendly staff, large plot, clean toilets and showers, clubhouse, pool and great restaurant. Useful and well-designed loading and unloading area for large ACs ( ours 7.5 m ) The only bad thing is that you have to reserve because it's full."
27336,2365002,3,park4nigt38140,12/09/2022,"Very friendly welcome person attentive Parking to empty the waste water perfect small downside for the wi-fi and for the noise of the road if you are at location 43 very noisy during the night and the wi-fi stops 10 m before the motorhome, too bad otherwise everything was ok"
27336,2286409,4,piloulefo,22/08/2022,"Very practical campsite 10 minutes from the beach, super clean sanitary facilities and a nickel swimming pool. Many people live there all year round and the campsite is noisy, with a pitch located near the road. Be careful with the sap of the pines which allow you to have shaded pitches. Finally the bus every hour to go to Barcelona is great."
27336,2193415,5,Laue,07/08/2022,Pleasant atmosphere. From here we visited Barcelona twice. The bus (e16) that stops right in front of the campsite takes about 1 hour. Bus per person for one trip €4.5. The sanitary facilities were very clean and perfectly adequate. The campsite shop had a good offer. You felt safe but integrated at the same time. Unfortunately a little longer to the beach.
27336,2190859,4,CristinaVoicu,07/08/2022,"The campsite is clean, the staff at the pool are not very good, the food at the restaurant is very good and affordable, Access to Barcelona is very easy, in front of the campsite you can take the bus to the train station and on the way back we took a taxi that brought us to the front the campsite for only 8 euros"
27336,2148593,3,p4nDingDong,30/07/2022,"Ok, but way too expensive, paid 63 eur for a night over 2 adults 3 kids (kids 10+ count as adults) electricity 7.50, but free wifi. Quite a culture shock after spending our time deeper in the south. Pool open 11-19:30 only. Would give only 2 stars but the atmosphere is still nice thanks to the campers being very relaxed. Pitches quite small and cramped. Staff kind."
27336,2145501,1,ducatfred63,30/07/2022,last year in the post-covid period this campsite was very happy to find us with our BIG 7m45 motorhome but this year when the tourists came back we were told that our motorhome is much too big for their little campsite....
27336,2141859,5,Bobbycar7707,29/07/2022,A nice campsite to visit Barcelona. The place and the sanitary facilities were always clean. The reception was friendly and competent in all questions. The bus (E 16) runs every half hour directly from the campsite to Barcelona (50 minutes). Our mobile home always felt safe. What more could you want. We will come back.
27336,2052944,4,ConnieLiam,09/07/2022,"Fair price especially if you use the ACSI card, pool opens 12-7 so we weren’t able to use it at all since we spend that time in Barcelona. We had to use bottles to fill up our water tank as there were no hose connection. Bus stop right outside was great to visit Barcelona. Would recommend to leave your motorhome or van whilst exploring the city as there are many bad reviews in the city about break ins."
27336,2048099,5,Mullaghroe,07/07/2022,"Camping Sitges is a pleasant, clean understated site, perfect for a visit to this beautiful town. Great value with ACSI and includes a very effective WiFi. Pool with attendant next to friendly bar/restaurant & small supermarket."

About 20 minutes to the beach, about 30 minutes to the city along the promenade. Approx. €24 for one night with electricity and ADAC discount."

It is a bit far from the center but if you like to walk it takes 20 minutes on foot. Otherwise possibility to rent bikes. There are buses too. Convenience store and restaurant on site reasonably priced.
27336,1813903,4,sirlanzecock,10/04/2022,"Very nice staff with great space. Cleanliness in the showers and the toilet cannot be better. It takes about half an hour to get to Sitges, but there is a bus connection, I have no experience with that. There is also a direct bus connection to Barcelona, but finding the right stop on the way back is a challenge."
27336,1811335,5,zenruffinen,09/04/2022,"Family campsite 800m from Sitges. Beautiful places without stones or roots, toilets in which we would like to stay longer so it smells good and it's clean. Warm and friendly welcome. The swimming pool opens at the beginning of May but the restaurant and the store are open. Choose seats on the left or in the center when entering, those on the right are too close to the highway."

In general, everything was very lovingly designed. The walk to the beach takes 20 minutes but it is a nice walk through beautiful streets and alleys."

27336,1396272,3,kty31,02/08/2021,"Correct camping. Fairly large plot in the shade for some. Swimming pool, restaurant and small supermarket very practical because the center of Sitges and the first shops are quite far ... fortunately the bus passes by because the center of the city is 45 minutes away on foot! Beach 20 minutes walk. Very clean sanitary facilities."
27336,1238090,4,annaundjannis,05/06/2021,"Nice place in itself, everything clean. The way to the beach is not the best. Good bus connections to Barcelona."
27336,861884,3,Goros6,11/07/2020,Very clean toilets and showers. It sticks to the pool that opens only from 11 to 19. For our taste it opens very late and closes early. The garbage leave it safe that the birds do not open!
27336,856458,4,ELDISCOVERO,09/07/2020,"Very good campsite. clean and well equipped. the negative: 20 to 30 minutes from the beach on foot depending on your speed there is a bus to go, but for the return .............. we are still waiting! !!!!! if not right now: it's building a lot right behind (cranes, trucks, .......)"

27336,722640,5,OttoTheCamperVan,16/10/2019,"Great campsite with friendly staff and very clean toilets, showers, washing-up facilities and you can even wash the clothes on hand basin. The washing machines and the tumbler for € 5 are not to use (very old appliances, detergent not included). And yes, now and then you hear the train or a motorcycle, but you have to be very sensitive to noise. The pool looks clean, there is a small restaurant and a small shop (looks ok, have not been tested). The night's sleep is only from 24 clock - until then, something is going on the weekend. Quiet earlier during the week. There are many locals in the square. In addition to the camping, the bus stops directly to Barcelona and on foot in 10 minutes on the beach and in 25 minutes at the train station in Sitges. The town can be reached in 15/20 minutes. Tip at the roundabout not over the bridge but slightly further towards Sitges and then through the underpass. So you always walk on a sidewalk."

27336,618802,4,pitpit,11/08/2019,"Good solution to spend the night in Sitges. It is true that the campsite is noisy but the toilets are very clean and the staff very accommodating. The first beach is 10 minutes walk. Sitges city center is a 25-minute walk away. In high season, we paid € 32.50 for 2 people (1 night with 1 van)."
27336,590096,5,sam59b,01/08/2019,"We spent 4 nights there to visit Barcelona. Family camping in a good spirit of the old campsites. Sanitary cleanliness and comfort remarkable! (Cleaned continuously from early morning until very late). Super friendly staff, very nice bar. In short, we strongly recommend. If you want to visit Barcelona, a bus from the company mon-bus commutes with a stop right in front of the campsite."
27336,546979,4,btvam,10/07/2019,"I came in 1999 but still the same campsite. Quiet by its population apart from the road that hinders at times. Sanitary very clean, they spend all the time and late. Superb pool. The employees are very nice. Price for a motorhome and 3 people without electricity 31.50 €. Beach 15 minutes walk. I recommend. A star in minus for the train and the road."

The historic center is a bit of a walk but feasible and no taxi wants to pick us up with a small dog. Otherwise a nearby bus can troubleshoot. Nice pool and good restaurant."

Camping always as clean and pleasant with its little birds. Location with electricity 33 euros. I strongly advise"

27336,160547,4,phc,29/07/2017,"Camping located near a railway line and on an air corridor from Barcelona airport. However, we did not find it embarrassing. This campsite has a very large swimming pool, a mini market. The pitches are very big and well shaded. The bathrooms are super clean. The first beaches are about 1km: 15/20 minutes walk or 5 minutes by bike."
27336,98519,2,ninichoch,22/08/2016,"Very mixed opinion on this campsite, all services (shower, bathroom, bar, restaurant, pool, etc. ..) are very good, and clean. On the other hand, it is next to a railway line, a very busy road (even at night) and the planes start their decent (or land) towards Barcelona.

27354,1844892,4,Jacomo32,22/04/2022,"A station area, we know what to expect: a lot of heavy goods vehicles, if you don't want them you have to go to a car park elsewhere. This area is large, well lit and fairly quiet if you stand on the opposite side of the road. Nice walk on foot taking the small road behind the station."

27354,1533639,5,MariaMI,31/08/2021,"To be a free area to spend the night and empty without deviating from the route, it is phenomenal and it is something exceptional that should be in other Repsol gas stations, as well as other companies that here in Spain have not even considered it. If you park in the back of the cafeteria it is quieter because the noise from the highway is muffled."

27354,735607,3,Aventuramenuda,01/11/2019,"Good area not to leave the route. Store and gas station open 24 hours. Something loud because of the proximity to the highway and the constant entry and exit of vehicles, the noise is reduced enough if we can get to the bottom."

The bad thing is the bathhouse, which should improve: cleaning, having toilet paper in the bathrooms and not outside, and hot water that is no longer in the afternoon (although this happens only in August because the kids do not have control or education of their parents and spend a lot of time in the shower, with music and everything). If it were not for this, a perfect campsite."
27356,249662,5,brammers,09/05/2018,"Well maintained and clean grassy pitches in beautifully situated campsite 'Amaido'. Nearby railway line converted into a walking and cycling track that goes for 14km. Adjoining restaurant does good value daily set menus. 18 euros per night including electricity off-season. Dogs at no extra cost. Service area is a little disorganised. Laundry, hot showers but no farm shop as advertised."

Boulevard and especially outdated trains generating noise... outdated!! But also...Bars and Discotheques. On March 2, a bar gave us ''very'' loud music and good bass until 2:00 am."

By bike only 10 minutes.  Off season (and not in weekends) are the nightclubs closed ;) We spent about 5 days here."
27363,2464853,3,JMBleelou,27/10/2022,"Good location, we weren’t bothered by people passing by. But beware of the loud nightclubs about! Even during working days it will get very loud and impossible to sleep. There are 2 good places at either ends. One is close to a cafe (good for toilet) and the other is by a rooftop bar (that really does shut at 00:00). The docks do make noise throughout the night but at least it’s tolerable."

There are two cafes, the indoor has toilets. Quiet at night, you can't hear the clubs even in the weekend in this end. A bit of traffic noise from the bridge and harbour but not a problem for me, and a few drunks passing on the bike lane. Left the van 4 days no problem"
27363,1654198,5,AndreaKlein,20/10/2021,"Very good for leaving the van standing there during the day. Paid 5 € for 6h. The parking lot is also guarded. Didn't stay here, however."

Do not hesitate to go down to the docks for more tranquility (sometimes it's so quiet that it's a little cut-throat ...) That said we had no security concerns. Beautiful flat bike path that connects the historic center on one side and the Belem tower on the other. Sensitive nostrils abstain, no tourist guide specifies it but the river feels very bad! And absolutely avoid the weekend! We spent the night on weekdays and it was very quiet, to the point that we wanted to spend a second ... and there radical change, music all night long and alcoholic people staggering everywhere.

Next to the municipal swimming pool and with a park next to it, a few meters away is the town. Be careful when you are already in the town, the GPS takes you on an unpaved road to the left, if you continue straight, you can go on the paved road. At this time there were 4 motorhomes. Very quiet and to repeat!"

When we arrived at night there was a van next to ours with the awning up and having a barbecue in the very parking lot. It's no wonder that they prohibit us from spending the night in more and more places, and if we continue with this behavior they will end up prohibiting everything. We all pay for four people who do things in the worst way."

And so it was: the only campsite on our trip in which they took our temperature, they assigned us an easy, wide, flame and grass pitch. We paid € 20 for AC, 4 people and electricity (dogs free). The best value for money I have found. The services are outdated but clean. I remove a star because my daughter had to shower with cold water (it was not the case of the others).

You can hide at the bottom under the trees without being embarrassed. Note that right next to it there are 2 dolmens and a seasonal sundial which are said to be very old. Many visitors come to see these monuments, which means that during the day cars come and go. But in the evening, it's super quiet and we slept very well there. Note that a forest ranger came early in the morning to climb into the forest and did not even stop at our height. No prohibition accordingly. Departure for hikes in the forest, as far as Biescas (accessible to people with reduced mobility !!!) or towards a fort and a Church in height: very nice.

Good beach accessible via nice path next to the campsite in 10-15 minutes. One night with 2 adults and 2 children €50.60 incl. electricity, a bit too expensive considering the price-quality ratio."
27453,2153855,5,mploi,31/07/2022,"Super quiet nature campsite, sufficiently large pitches. Beach accessible by a path lined with apple trees and eucalyptus. We were supposed to stay there 2 nights we stayed there 7 nights! About 30€ per night for a van 2 adults 2 children (6 years old and 2 years old). Cultural activities close by car."
27453,2103230,1,stef83,21/07/2022,"very unpleasant welcome, the boss welcomed us like intruders when we just wanted to take a look. Very small pitches, the impression of being herded like cattle. To flee !"

But very clean, well-managed, friendly, shopping opportunities for groceries directly on site or a 5-minute walk in Vega. Walk to the beach through eucalyptus forest, then the view is guaranteed and you will be compensated for the narrowness of the square."

Being at the top and having a need to empty, we went to this campsite to ask if they would let us empty for a fee. The man, with a very bad treatment, told me that this service was only for the campsite."

Fine signs of 150 euros for removing tables, chairs, etc. Good access from the NV-2. If you go along the N-634 with a motorhome, be careful with Google, it can send you to the NV-2 along a very narrow and twisty road."

To the beach which is a nice walk of 10 minutes with beautiful views of the beautiful but busy bay. You can dispose of waste here, no further facilities. Partly shaded areas, in the evening the sun goes behind the trees and everyone has shade."

27458,3051207,4,CarmenIgne,31/07/2023,"Place to park without services. Near a path by the sea, a human trail through which you can go to Puerto de Vega, which is beautiful. Place to rest. Nothing can be removed. Police pass and fine. Cornfield path leads to the parking lot."

27458,2982533,5,ConnorZik,18/07/2023,"This car park was the most accessible for campers in this area. No services. lots of flat space for parking. Peaceful and a 5 minute walk down to a stunning beach where people were surfing and where you can see sunset. 
Civil Guard patrolled in the morning around 9am.
Different category bins to aid recycling! 
It was peaceful and beautiful here. 
Nothing much wrong."
27458,2971299,3,RoccoXRBOUT,16/07/2023,"Normal pitch meadow. Have used the spot as an alternative option, as you are not allowed to spread out on the main car park at the bar, according to signs and owners. The sign is not here, but in the morning the police came and issued warnings about dogs and ""camping"". So here, too, you must not take up more space than your closed camper (no chairs, awning, etc.)"

27458,2687685,4,Wunderkinder,22/04/2023,"We didn't sleep that well, it was very windy. The beach is not the prettiest, it has black sand. The shallow parts of the river were good for the kids though. Otherwise it is very quiet in itself. Little activity, but you can definitely hear the street. You can also watch the sunset from the beach. There is also room to turn."

27458,2583332,5,NatyE,19/02/2023,"Quiet place to sleep, the parking lot below is more uneven. The beach is easily accessible on foot, which by the way is one of the beaches used for the filming of a mystery and horror movie (Secret of Marrowbone). Recommended!"
27458,2582836,5,JorgeCF,19/02/2023,"We enjoyed a very quiet night in February, it's perfect for accessing the beach along the way, there are trash and recycling bins. It would do him good to just have a source."

Thanks to Navia City Council.

On the other hand, no table, chair or awning, or any other sign of installation are tolerated. We get 4G, access to a vast sandy beach. Surf school and beach bar nearby (parking side 1). Quietest spot of the 3 parking lots for vans"

There are still people who do not know that it is a parking lot and they cannot take out the chairs and tables. This morning the local police called the attention of several who were having lunch outside. It must also be said that they were all AC for rent and should not be well integrated.
27458,1470105,5,CarmenSan,17/08/2021,Quiet place to rest and enjoy the beach and walks in the area (Senda Costa Naviega PK-11). In the green areas they allow you to take tables. Lucky to be here.

No WC or water nearby (there are showers and drinking water on the beach). Beware of mosquitoes!"
27458,1411670,4,Yojonube,06/08/2021,"Good place to sleep, but small, if you want to sleep you have to arrive early, there are cars of people who go to the beach, but they leave and leave spaces for AC. He passed the GC in the morning but only patrolling. The beach is incredibly huge and wide."

27469,3258783,5,SimonePa,04/09/2023,"A nice campsite: friendly welcome (can also speak English), large pitches and clean sanitary facilities. There are some long-term campers, but living together on the site works very well. The sea is very close, as are the dinosaur tracks. The nearest shop is approx. 1.3 km away. There is also a small supermarket on site, but we didn't use it."

27469,3075711,1,jorest,04/08/2023,"We asked the price of taking a shower and they told us that we could not shower if we were not staying.

27469,3006108,4,cristiqd,23/07/2023,"Friendly staff, large and level squares. Close to the beach and restaurants. Nice children's area. Family camping, depends on the neighbors who touch you, a bit noisy."
27469,2958577,4,MJCC1919,13/07/2023,"Very well located, next to the beach. It has a restaurant and supermarket and a green area with a park and barbecue. High value: 35€ per night, 1 AC with electricity, 2 adults and 1 child of 3 years old for the conditions, the toilet is separate from the washbasin and there was no soap. Noisy space until midnight. Changing the AC waters is not convenient, the dirty ones are in the toilet and the others at the exit of the camping and tight."
27469,2938566,5,wholeofthemoon23,08/07/2023,"Pleasant campsite - good facilities, nice staff, great location. Has a bit of a family vibe to it (potential to be a bit noisy at night with people catching up/kids going about on bikes etc). Good sized pitches. Seems like a place a lot of people return to. We’d go back :)."
27469,2926681,5,JIGE0305,05/07/2023,"It's very nice. Easy access to the beach walking 5 min. large, level plots. Nice staff. The bathrooms are large and have children's bathtubs. Very quiet, I would return and spend more days. The town 3 min by car with all services nearby."
27469,2897796,5,LenaKue,27/06/2023,"Everything was great, we paid around €45 for two nights with two people, a car and a roof tent. The mountains behind us and the sea in front of us, what more could you want. The shandy (beer) tastes great, only the patatas bravas didn't convince us. ;-)"
27469,2874513,5,WB97,20/06/2023,"Beautiful and very well-kept place, clean sanitary facilities. €28.50 for two people, bus and 10Amp electricity."

27469,2395095,5,jesushinojo,22/09/2022,"The campsite is outside the town (about 4km or so) but it's very good, we spent one night and we liked it a lot, very quiet, the facilities were very good and the showers too. The large plots. Then one thing that we really liked was a grassy area with a park, a soccer field and a couple of nets. They also had barbecues (free). It is next to the beach It cost us €21"
27469,2394945,5,Rueedi,22/09/2022,Very clean campsite in a quiet location. We felt very comfortable. Closes on September 30th!
27469,2369794,4,axgmobil,14/09/2022,"Very nice campsite, large pitches, everything very clean! Sanitary facilities were constantly cleaned. Beautiful location on the beach, ideal for families.

27469,2362876,4,WVT1973,11/09/2022,Nice nice campsite. Close to beach. Very clean toilets and showers. Washing machines and dryer available.

27469,2324355,3,bili3,31/08/2022,"€28,60 a night, with van and 3 people. Very close to the beach. Attention can be improved in the bar. A dog that lives next door woke us up barking, quite unpleasantly. The campsite is very green and the toilets are clean."
27469,2308756,4,dsi78,27/08/2022,"Camping in front of the Greek beach. Magnificent situation. Super friendly staff. Bar a little weak but there is a little shop with the necessary. We would have stayed more nights but because of the route we could not, but ideal to stay"
27469,2308535,5,RV3,27/08/2022,"A very good deal, being full they accommodated us in a play area, everything very clean and very friendly people, one night for just over 20 euros without electricity, thanks for your work and kindness."
27469,2280597,5,Helena_rp,21/08/2022,"Very quiet and very clean campsite, we liked it a lot. Nice and respectful people. Despite being high season, Saturday, being full and having the worst plot for being next to the access barrier to the campsite..., we slept wonderfully (and I'm a light sleeper), we didn't hear anything at night and we had privacy. We recommend it."
27469,2261035,4,NICO688,18/08/2022,"the plot that we had was wide, the bad thing is that it was right next to the road and you could hear quite a lot of cars and people passing by even at night. Otherwise well. close to the beach and interesting places to visit."
27469,2213073,5,Fabe07,10/08/2022,"nice quiet campsite. near beach. greenery, shaded, a bar, a small supermarket. the village of Llastres (3km away) is magnificent...with its port, its restaurants and its old houses. beautiful region with lots of walks and many villages to discover."
27469,2185013,5,doradruif,06/08/2022,Near beautiful beach. Many walking and cycling opportunities nearby. Mountain bikes can be booked through the information center. Will be delivered/picked up. Sanitary very clean. Village nearby.
27469,2175402,5,california6675,04/08/2022,"Clean, nice people, quiet. Beach with nice sand right next to the camping site. Camping van with 2 adults and 2 children was 31 € / night (no electricity). We were able to reserve on the same day via phone ."
27469,2100920,4,Camper_damah,21/07/2022,"The campsite is very good, the setting is wonderful and the beach right on the doorstep. Children's and sports area. It has a bar and supermarket. The toilets need updating. The town is far away."
27469,2081530,3,rebecahuerta28,16/07/2022,"Campsite with many places. Very clean showers and toilets. We were charged €22.40 for two adults and a van, one night. Reasonable price, since it has many services and everything was very clean. It is a few meters from the beach. Typical family camping, lots of kids. For our taste, very crowded."
27469,2066493,4,SofiaMancebo,12/07/2022,"Small but cozy campsite. At the foot of the beach. Very nice treatment of the workers. Economic since for one night 2 people and a sleeping car were €22.40. If you want to stay a little longer, they gave us the option of charging half a day and they let us leave the next day at 6:00 p.m. The bathrooms were being cleaned all the time. Facilities a bit old."
27469,2044070,3,FridaJanz,06/07/2022,"Good location, clean sanitary facilities. Very suitable for families with (smaller) children, clearly too busy for people without children who are looking for relaxation (also during the week). The children race across the square with their small bicycles, because they can manage the small hill :-), but until late at night. We then drove on after one night."
27469,1958897,4,Moriarti79,08/06/2022,"Privileged place on the beach. Clean plots, neat grass and very complete services. Bar with sandwiches and pizzas. Supermarket with the basics."
27469,1920755,3,T4Kasper,27/05/2022,"The campsite is well-kept and clean, but for two people with a van €27.20 a night is not justified. The location is not the nicest and there are many permanent campers in the middle, we didn't like the beach."
27469,1898338,5,RuthKopf,18/05/2022,"Nice, level place with large pitches. Nicely located by the river and not far from the beach. Easily accessible from the motorway. Very clean and large number of sanitary facilities that are well maintained. At the moment (May) there are many empty places, no need to reserve."
27469,1668130,3,Rabaru,29/10/2021,Closed. We have arrived and it was closed until next year. We cannot assess but let us know in case someone else thinks of coming here.
27469,1593688,5,Faleraandthehippievan,20/09/2021,"Very clean toilets and showers, somebody is always cleaning there. Staff is very kind and helpfull. Kids play untill late in the evening and some people play music, but nothing too disturbing. Ground was almost level. Beach VERY nearby, about a 5 minute walk to the sea. I highly recommend walking to Lastres from here, a lovely morning walk with great views!"
27469,1590237,4,Emma270674,18/09/2021,"The first night we arrived the site was very busy and loud, we were getting worried as it was getting late but eventually it all calmed down.  The 2nd night was a Sunday and we realised everyone had gone home and it was really pleasant.  The facilities are very very clean, a cleaner appeared to be present 24/7!  Showers were nice and hot.  The park is in a beautiful location."
27469,1589587,5,luciafaimberg,18/09/2021,"In mid-September the campsite was not crowded at all, very quiet. The same beach, not very crowded. Very clean campsite and spacious pitches."
27469,1578968,4,JuliaLiAr,14/09/2021,"Average camping. they follow the covid measures in the bathrooms very well. for children there is a very nice park. the beach next door is super crowded ... The pitches maybe a little short, but generally good."
27469,1571398,3,lauschitour,12/09/2021,"Well organized and clean campsite. Pretty high prizes even in the off season. I cannot recommend staying over the weekend. Super loud and crowded, many families and super loud music until 1 am."
27469,1566729,4,Lorea10,10/09/2021,"Fairly acceptable campsite. It is September and of course there are not many people. Next to the beach of La Griega. At one kilometer 200 MTS Colunga and three kilometers from Llastres. Cleaning staff continuously cleaning, few campsites do this and, that we have already been in several."
27469,1495091,3,cesarcampcalifornia,22/08/2021,"Very noisy, a lot of people. The campsite is very beautiful and has excellent recreational areas. Very basic showers and toilets (latrines and showers only separated with screens). The setting is beautiful, beach and river next door literally."
27469,1440000,5,annalie013,11/08/2021,"We have spent one night. Good plot size; Very clean sinks and showers, all the time there were cleaning staff. A bit expensive bar prices, otherwise we have been luxury."
27469,1434524,4,mserr386,10/08/2021,"Camping very well located to visit Asturias, but there were few services due to the size of the campsite, there is only one toilet area, however there were two people cleaning them throughout the day. It is quite noisy, especially if you have the plot near the showers, as there were young people with very loud music while showering and children playing until 12 at night, time of silence."
27469,1421167,3,Maryde80,08/08/2021,"Passable camping, many people, and the pitches very close together, but it is in a very beautiful environment."
27469,1413081,5,Burritos,06/08/2021,"Very nice camping, good atmosphere, playground for children, barbecues, spacious and well-kept pitches. Check-out time is at 12 noon. They let us stay until 2:30 pm to take advantage of a little more, very kind. Common areas (laundry, showers, bathrooms) very clean, appreciated."
27469,1385808,5,goribf6,31/07/2021,"Really recommended campsite, price per night with two adults and ac 20 euros. Flat pitches, friendly staff and they have two people dedicated specifically all day to cleaning bathrooms and common areas. Close to the beach, walking routes and cycling routes. Ideal as a base to move from there. Easy access for large motorhomes. As a negative point we did not find the bar staff friendly and the price somewhat expensive"
27469,1374378,4,mmendizabal,28/07/2021,"Tiny and very quiet campsite. Near the beach and next to the route to see dinosaur footprints, ideal to spend a few days with children. The toilets, showers, sinks ... very clean, there is a pending excuse to clean it every so often. Around you can visit MUJA and the town of LLastres!"
27469,1367550,5,anaha,26/07/2021,"We spent one night (van + 2 adults + light = € 26.70). Good camping in general, it is difficult to contact by phone on weekends, but once you get it the reception and the treatment are excellent. Also great is the anti-covid protocol (continuous cleaning). Very close to the mouth of the river and the beach of La Griega, the dinosaur footprints and the Jurassic Museum."
27469,1363504,4,svivast,25/07/2021,"Good price, beautiful area with a route that you can walk on the way that takes you to the dinosaur sites. Maybe too crowded and noisy."
27469,1358846,4,Alina-Mihaela,24/07/2021,"Nice campsite with flat pitches. We had a plot next to the river, under the shade of a tree, so the stay was pleasant. Quite crowded in summer with many children so during the day it is a bit noisy, but overall fine and very clean. Camping right next to the beach and with a route where you find dinosaur footprints. 2 people, one AC with light, € 27 per night."
27469,1355403,3,Conny1956,23/07/2021,"Quiet, beautiful location, but in the main travel season the place is full and you stand very close to each other. No shade, but cheap 20 euros, mobile, two people and electricity."
27469,1326021,5,Frinzaska,15/07/2021,"Cheap! Groomed! Very, very nice young staff! The sanitary facilities are cleaned around the clock, even after every shower! Yes, children romp about what children do. The campsite can't do anything for that! I highly recommend him !!!!"
27469,1278683,1,AxelKaatsch,26/06/2021,"The sanitary facilities and the place very well maintained, but raging children until midnight there is no rest, I cannot recommend it."
27469,1246266,5,Joe1963,10/06/2021,"Nice place by the stream with electricity, everything very clean, path to the sea approx. 50m, you can also walk to the Jurassic Park along the sea (600m)"
27469,1058787,5,lamardebien,19/09/2020,"Super quiet campsite in an unbeatable environment. all the plots in green area and very spacious. very complete services and frequent cleaning. the staff is great.

27469,1027571,5,larainfante,05/09/2020,"An ideal campsite, impeccable cleaning, it has a grill, a children's area, a beautiful river, a spectacular beach, a route to dinosaur tracks and beautiful places by car. The most recommended price, we were two people, two dogs, caravan and car, € 27.5 a day, with showers, laundry, area to wash clothes by hand, and to wash dishes, also restaurant and supermarket, I will return for sure."

27469,1001700,4,Tommy15,25/08/2020,"It only lacks a pool, true from other comments, they clean bathrooms all the time. Near the beach and river if you go with a dog. Price for being August super good"
27469,996596,4,VVD,23/08/2020,Very friendly staff. Constant cleaning of the bathrooms and showers. Location close to the beach. We had a plot in a very quiet area but there were some noisier areas.
27469,992766,4,XaviAlc,22/08/2020,"The campsite is small, but in a fantastic place where river and sea meet. The river divides the plots from the children's area (fantastic) which is accessed via a bridge. Not that it is particularly quiet, but it is not the typical “Mediterranean” beach campsite (where I come from) with the chunda chunda. Absolutely huge cleaning (at least in Covid times) there are staff PERMANENTLY (literal) cleaning facilities. The plot that we had in front of the bathroom somewhat noisy, but normal Very good sandwiches and pizzas in the bar, the staff, with some very specific exceptions, very friendly. A pleasant surprise."
27469,983004,4,windalo,20/08/2020,"Campsite between mountains, beach and by the river, idyllic place. 25 Euros motorhome with electricity and two people in August, very cheap for what it offers. Leisure area with barbecues. Bathrooms with staff cleaning all the time. I take away the fifth star because the sewage drain is inside the bathroom."
27469,970200,4,Rutyreneivankir,16/08/2020,"The location is very good, the night we got electricity € 30, two adults, a child and the motorhome, apparently you can't park on the entire coast of Asturias, so it's really worth it."
27469,964171,4,Lunila,15/08/2020,"Camping on the beach, very beautiful, very clean and continuously disinfected. A bit loud, lots of people chatting late."
27469,963748,4,livistong,14/08/2020,"The unbeatable site, a beautiful beach with a route to La Isla with dinosaur tracks included. Very attentive staff and cleanliness in the bathrooms due to the constant Covid."

27469,900048,4,gachero,26/07/2020,"Very friendly staff, very clean bathrooms and staff waiting to disinfect what you use, large plots and good value for money, I do not give it 5 stars because it lacks a pool although it has a beach right next to it. Highly recommended overall"
27469,893137,3,perlanegra22,24/07/2020,"Good camping. Clean, tidy and with grass plots and some with shade. Wifi. Good price. The worst: the roadside pitches are very noisy during the day. At night there is a lack of absolute control of the children's uproar until the wee hours. Good beach Good route to La Isla, which leaves near the campsite. Friendly staff."
27469,892877,5,Cali4motion,23/07/2020,"Beach attached to the campsite, excellent treatment, flat and green plots, clean bathrooms and a person continuously cleaning and disinfecting, a children's park. Family and quiet environment."

27469,872672,5,uxumuxu,16/07/2020,"Everything wonderful. Perfect place to spend a few days, very good beach. The spotless bathrooms, the lovely girl who attended us, the big pitches. Without any doubt, recommended 100x100. Surely we repeat."
27469,666481,5,astrorey,29/08/2019,"Camping very well located. The very flat plots. Cleaning at every moment. Nice family staff. Right price. The only downside I can put is that for children it has no animation or activities. But to go without children and relax is ideal. Very good communication. And the ideal beach, when it is low tide you can walk to the beach of Llastres."
27469,548675,3,coquillett,11/07/2019,"It was not amazing but it helped us out. Apart from the location, the campsite is without charm and the staff moderately friendly. The price is very correct (34.30 for 2 ad 2enf elec), sanitary are clean."
27469,321658,3,Docteur,08/08/2018,"Small typical Spanish campsite. Small places. Some on the roadside. The games for children are a little outdated and Turkish toilets for these gentlemen. Near the beach, supervised and rocks not far to explore. The corner is nice."

Basic plot with unevenness, they let you take out awnings and you can fill and empty waters, 5 minutes from Bolonia beach. It could be much better, I do not mind paying in the areas as long as they are good, but it is not the case."

We distrusted a man who was with him accompanying him. We told him that we were going to the Museum and we came back for one thing, he came to the AC and told us why we had returned so soon ... When he went to the Museum, he walked behind us ... we were not calm. A weak favor does people like this in the area."

27493,962816,1,mcr_huelva,14/08/2020,"This site is a clear example of taking advantage of a private space without investing a euro in the well-being of travelers. It is a corral with a very uneven floor, walls of rusted sheet metal or supported with struts. No toilets, no bathroom, a sink for more than 100 families. They use stones to delimit the filling zone. Everything good about Bologna, which is a lot, is outside that area. I will never go back."
27493,954788,3,FrancescMR,12/08/2020,"Area with all services. It also allows parking for cars that go to the beach (I imagine that only if they have free spaces). The area is very wide and quite uneven. The water area needs an urgent remodeling, it is very deteriorated. The reception is friendly. If you want to get to the dunes, consider that it will take at least an hour to walk there ... but it will be worth it!"

27493,905705,5,Luisa18,28/07/2020,"Fantastic place to spend a few days on this wonderful beach in Bolonia. Without a doubt, the best place in the entire municipality of Tarifa. A pity that the coast of Gaditana is not prepared to properly accommodate motorhome tourism. This summer they will undoubtedly lose a lot of money. There is plenty of room to make comfortable places for motorhomes and all you can find are prohibition signs, and the risk of a considerable fine. We are also families or groups of friends who go on vacation and want to enjoy without feeling like a kind of clandestinity imposed with so much prohibition."

With a sense of humor and a good dose of good will you could even call the outdoor shower behind bamboo fence as a sanitary facility ... The fence made of concrete walls and wood, unfortunately, no prospect. Overall, there is simplicity here. Okay for 1 night"
27493,392331,2,Adamas31,12/10/2018,"Surprising, a meadow, a palisade of salvaged wood with three shower heads, but hot and pressure. Very excessive prices for the service. We had a good laugh with my wife, but I would not put the wheels back."

27493,304056,3,TRIZAS,28/07/2018,"The good that is very well located, close to the beach. The bad, that the area is neglected, the terrain inclined, the spaces not delimited, the electrical connection consists of extensions placed in a bad way hanging from the streetlights and it is difficult to find the owner. The showers are basic, outdoors but sufficient. better if there was a bathroom."

""Showers"" are 1 corridor made with wooden planks sewn with wires and three shower taps without physical separation (jail type) On the floor jammed scupper and broken plastic chair to leave your stuff.

This total amount includes sanitary, let's forgive a collective showered area in the open air on a rather rustic concrete slab and I'm not talking about faucets that are surely from recovery. Concerning the ground to envisage wedges, slight slope, no arrangement nor electricity. In short a field where we had a good night because there were only two caravans and a van.
