Yes, not all pitches are the same in size or shade, but everything is in top condition. Value for money is right and if you don't get along, you have to move on."

81898,1725681,1,Beaparis,04/01/2022,"As I entered I left the campsite. First, people stop at the same door (where the railing is raised to pass) to check in without the possibility of me continuing. All narrow, small plots and a lot of fuss. People with chairs in the same passage of the car, who had to stop so that they dismounted and could continue with the car. I do not recommend at all."

82100,3086031,4,GuizScellier,06/08/2023,"Quiet night. Place that seems secure. Not the most beautiful place but rare ""wild"" corner 10 minutes from Guimaraes. No view. A few mountain bikes and walkers in the morning. A few dogs at night. Weak network but OK. Be careful, big deep tractor tracks at the start of the dirt path, it passes the limit on the left with a VW T6 van. In rainy weather, that must be impossible."
82100,2590528,4,thedudewiththeblackdog,25/02/2023,A beautiful and quiet spot. But the road is very steep. Not all cars can make it (mine was on the verge).
82100,2406443,2,alexandrrrah,27/09/2022,"the road is a mess. very steep. i believe the place is nice, but we couldn't get there."

82100,2252170,4,Snoopy34,16/08/2022,"Very quiet location, despite very steep access and not possible for all vehicles. It was raining when we got there and we skated several times. But that your well worth the detour to deserve a very very quiet night."
82100,2235132,4,PYT29,14/08/2022,Quiet and pleasant location at the edge of the forest. There are no cars but it is a fairly popular path for mountain bikers. Prefer access from the west much easier than from the north.
82100,1766260,4,BexNMex,26/02/2022,"very quiet place with only cyclists passing, one undisturbed night in february. quite a lot of level ground. good 4G signal. the drive up was VERY steep, but managed in a MWB sprinter"

82106,2809102,1,laurenlalifree,01/06/2023,"Overnight stays are prohibited! It is a natural park and, as such, the civil guard can come and fine you, which is precisely what happened to us. Talking about it later with acquaintances, the same thing happened to them, they had been fined. It's not worth the risk as there are many other equally wonderful places nearby."
82106,2207091,1,user99,09/08/2022,"in este lugar NO se puede aparcar, es parque natural y no se puede pernoctar, hay una señal que lo indican, multan. In this place you can NOT park, it is a natural park and at the bend you have a sign that prohibits parking, they give you a fine."
82106,1867101,5,gajettelaiv,03/05/2022,Beautiful spot. Keep places like this pristine. Pack out garbage and pack out or bury toilet paper.
82106,1414547,4,marcussanzholm,06/08/2021,Super quiet and beautiful views. Asphalt road first and then a small piece of cement. Throughout the afternoon-evening 2 cars passed.

82106,725008,4,gagou71,19/10/2019,"Very beautiful view. Very nice place but unfortunately we were kindly fired after the 2nd day because it is a nature reserve. Ban on sleeping at night. If you still try to stay discreet and be clean, there are a lot of animals around. (and forest guards)"
82106,709382,5,Spongeboy,30/09/2019,"Stunning location. A few miles from a spectacular swimming spot you can stop off at on your way here. The views are like something out of the Lion King! We got our 7.5m Adria here no problem. There’s no way you’d find it without Park4Night, so well done and keep up the good work."

82153,2747842,4,MontyTheMagnificent,14/05/2023,"Great spot, in a huge car park and we have awoken overlooking olive trees. We stopped in the coach bays ((7m long) Not too hot in May. Visited the Museo in afternoon and asked to stay over for a tour the following morning. They certainly don’t promote overnights, and receptionist wavered when we asked. Super restaurant open until late in evening. Fascinating park."
82153,2692377,5,Francky33,24/04/2023,"We have just spent the night there, it is indeed very quiet once the museum visitors have left."

82153,2454098,5,wyvern,20/10/2022,"Stayed over night for free. This gets 5 stars for the amazing views, starlit nights. However, this is the largest site for Paleolithic engravings in the world….the museum is superb, a guided tour of the site can be booked which requires a 20 min drive to the site where you are picked up by Jeep and a guide (a must do event) finishing with a good evening meal at the restaurant. Brilliant!"
82153,2451273,4,5reisende,19/10/2022,A pleasant and quiet car park right by the museum - definitely worth walking down the archaeological trail at sunset.

82153,1940283,5,EdithPedevilla,02/06/2022,"A parking lot that became a whole program for us! At first we thought we would find a comfortable place to stay overnight, but that turned out to be: * a wonderful dinner in the excellent museum restaurant * a quiet one. dark night, guarded by the museum dog * a visit to the museum that gave us completely new insights. * A breakfast in the restaurant. * VE at the parking space of the place."

82153,1773301,5,iriaxana,04/03/2022,"I asked at the museum if I could sleep and very kindly they allowed me to stay. The super quiet night, with lights from the museum itself but that allow us to see the star show that surrounds us. In a high but still less windy area than in the town. The wonderful views of the meeting of the Côa River with the Duero"
82153,1731434,5,bellavie02,10/01/2022,"Museum car park which, unfortunately, is closed on Mondays when we had to leave. Nice site, clean and quiet."

82153,527635,5,1407,24/06/2019,"Are very satisfied with this parking, very flat, nothing to complain about. We came to 2 motorhomes to sleep and were alone, quiet, with a wonderful 360 degree view.

82153,489387,3,RoamingFree,21/05/2019,Beautiful view and interesting museum. There is a toilet outside the restaurant that is accessible during the day (not sure of hours). Car park is flat and quiet.
82153,462620,5,mlarb,21/04/2019,Great spot. Follow the Museum signs all the way otherwise the SatNav might send you through the backstreets like ours did.
82153,461026,5,LesDAVIDGlobe-Trotters,20/04/2019,"We stayed there for one day plus one night. Mountain hiking trail that takes you to the edge of the Douro on the old railway, provide breath. museum restaurants. Very nice place for a day and a night not a noise at night we stayed on a Friday night. Possibility of refueling in the area of the city after the stay. provide tap nose 3/4."

82188,1850693,5,MichaMaeusemelker,24/04/2022,"Magic. Wonderful place. We stayed for 24 hours and enjoyed the silence and to swim in the lake. Nonetheless we picked up two bags of trash wandering around the lake. First glimpse you don't see it but there is plenty. If you have 30 minutes, just pick up some stuff and leave a place cleaner than you found it.

And we actually came from the other side and were standing there completely alone."
82188,1761320,4,Molgugge,20/02/2022,"very nice, idyllic place!"
82188,1671953,1,OmamaNina,31/10/2021,"The last 1.5 km is a gravel road with pronounced potholes. I arrived in the dark and had to give up 160 meters to go. Now I am ""in the middle of nowhere"". I can only hope to somehow get out of here tomorrow when it is light. Better to avoid this goal !!!"
82188,1640401,5,vitaaart,12/10/2021,"We spent a quiet night and visited a little fox in the evening. :) At this super nice spot at 7 o'clock in the morning anglers came on the other side of the lake. it is best to drive a little further after the entrance to the lake, as there is a place in the shade where you are not exposed to the midday sun as intensely."
82188,1638875,5,elgriegonet,11/10/2021,"A lovely place! If instead of staying there, you keep continuing for 500m you’ll arrive at a really wonderful place. The road is not that bad. You can access if the weather is not rainy. I really had teo lovely days there. Signal weak with Vodafone 2/4 LTE outside but inside the van 1/4 3G."

82188,1323430,4,Stefanus,14/07/2021,"As has already been said, a very bumpy but doable road to get there. In the evening we were attacked by mosquitoes, 3 citronella candles and 1 citronella incense, to no avail! We had to go inside. View and of course breathtaking"
82188,1230965,4,Jorge02,01/06/2021,"Very quiet uneven and without bins, you have to go around the lake quite a bit, the location is not very exact in general, well"
82188,1125824,5,busterbill,30/12/2020,"Lovely tranquil location, 5 stars from me, no litter bin when I was here but it's easy to take your rubbish with you. The road is pretty rough but doable in a campervan (Fiat ducato)"

Good wifi signal on Vodafone.  25mb up and down. Important for me as I work online."
82220,476351,4,pusyneta,05/05/2019,"We have spent the night perfectly. The town deserves to be visited. There are no water services or emptying, the sewers are rain. Well located, 500m from the square."

82220,293124,4,JaviRT46,19/07/2018,I slept today and perfect very quiet and the bathrooms open at 8:30
82262,2060651,3,YaiHer,11/07/2022,Parking for 3 vans. We didn't even try the one below it because it touches the bottom of the van (very steep). Very narrow streets. It is recommended to park in the car park below the bar.
82267,2942402,3,ChyC,09/07/2023,The tap is pressable and the water comes out in a gush that irrigates everything within a radius of 1m.
82267,2648646,5,Burgaillo,08/04/2023,"An area that I like because it gives you room to spend the night both in the official zone (right next to the cleaning zone) and in front (under the chestnut trees, where we slept). Very silent, balanced terrain, I recommend it."
82267,2135900,1,Paichi,28/07/2022,"Grief faucets, to get made a soup, are changed places. We couldn't stay, they are setting up the tents for a party. We continue our journey"

82267,1495428,4,J-LCastillejo,22/08/2021,"An area near Mondoñedo and ideal to rest. The town hall allows parking on the side of the area, grassy area without shade (ideal for charging with solar panel) or on the other side in a chestnut grove. A bit of confusion with the taps, I think they have been mounted the other way around: the clean water one does not have a thread and the black one does."
82267,1471768,5,kikufadulla,17/08/2021,Zone 10 to relax under the chestnut trees. Playground very close.

82295,2996669,5,park4nigth2012,21/07/2023,"Unbeatable location, with direct access to the beach, you can take dogs. It includes emptying and filling, for €12 it is worth parking in the parking lot and not on the street, plus they are fined if they see you parked on the street. In short, I give a 10 for the site and the treatment."

It is important to know that the campers parking is in the right, and the normals cars parking is on the left. In case you see only the one with high limit.

It has very good access to the beach.

there is noise from the disco. so better go to the end of the parking"

You can't take out awnings or tables or anything. Good beach for a walk. The town can be reached both by the beach and by the sidewalk. About 25 '. It has a small supermarket nearby with what you need.
82295,1360674,2,Bull71,25/07/2021,"It is a parking lot, not an area, terrible services, and expensive. They don't let you get anything out. The only good thing that is near the beach. I will not come back."

82295,1326169,3,camperptv,15/07/2021,"A place to spend the night near Zahara de los Atunes. A fenced open space with toilets and water drainage. No showers. You cannot remove awnings or tables or anything, a shame because with some improvement it could be a perfect area. It seems that they have something to do with the campsite but they do not share services."
82295,1322552,3,ineine,14/07/2021,"Good stop, has to empty and fill and direct access to the beach. In a walk you get to the town. They should improve two details: the floor, which is very earthy, and the possibility of taking out a table and chairs. Unfortunately at the time of our departure, when going to empty grays, a worker told us that the platform had just been painted and we had to wait two hours for it to dry."

82295,1294734,4,silvia28035,04/07/2021,"I would give it 5 stars if it had light and some shade. Otherwise, it is perfect to spend a couple of days on the beach. In Atlanterra there is a very good local butcher and fish shop."
82295,1292726,5,Cordy,03/07/2021,Seems it is extended now with a huge parking only for campers directly behind the beach. No shade but I think there is also a service station! We just saw it from the camping which was packed.

82298,1016793,4,bokikin,31/08/2020,"I think he is not in San Josep, so that ordinance is useless. Land parking with some unevenness (not much), perfect for catching the ferry that goes to Formentera. It has shops and bars in the surroundings. At night there is hardly any noise"

They have a barbecue to rent. There is light and they can leave you a 50-meter extension in case you want to be away (as is the case with the dog). There are many roads by which you have to go. It's worth it.

If you do not have very deep sleep, I do not recommend it. The views are beautiful, but they don't deserve so much trouble. If you are going to eat at O Malecon you have to try the seaweed and cockle scramble, it is very original and it is very good. For size without problems with a 7m."
82338,517712,4,Polillos,16/06/2019,Great parking with great views if you get a place in the front row of the marina ... quiet at night we assume that in summer season it will not be so much ... and 900 meters the service area to fill and empty ... and also good parking spaces between the Civil Guard and health center ... very close walk from the town ... Charming town ...

82462,744981,1,pascale17,19/11/2019,"What a shame that a city like Aranjuez does not do anything for the camper, we slept in front of the palace, but at 8 o'clock we were not in the right queue a security guard made us move with the buses. Nothing to empty, the campsite throws us for the services you have to sleep one night. Well disappointing because pretty things to see like the casa del labrador I advice and the palace"
82462,721714,5,Magellan6665,14/10/2019,"Perfectly amazing to be allowed to sleep in the park facing the Palace. it's beautiful, the road from the center is not allowed to big vehicles. We slept with two other vans. A little noisy at night with young people who come to party at any time of the night, police very present in the park. Difficulty to leave the park in the morning because Trey quickly blocked by cars."

So we went to Madrid by train. We also slept on Monday night and today Tuesday at 9:30 a girl came to tell us that this is heritage and you cannot park. At 10 minutes came 2 security guys also saying that this is a tourist area, that at 10 opens the palace and we can not be here. Conclusion, they don't even know the reason for the ban. They just don't want us here. :-( ideal to sleep and follow or come Sunday."

In winter it has to be wonderful. Very, very quiet, although by day only with the transit of the vehicles of National Heritage can be quite dusty if they pass by. The tourist train departs right next door. 100% recommendable"

82484,629254,5,lou731,15/08/2019,Perfect. In the village we could attend a great concert. And the place to sleep is just perfect: lost in the mountains and at the edge of a river.
82484,584158,4,Radialkay,29/07/2019,"An amazing place! We found it thanks to the previous comments, since the GPS effectively marks the wrong address."

82484,357556,4,mol,28/08/2018,"The GPS makes you go through the bridge that is not. At the first roundabout, take the direction of the train station and once there turn left.

82491,1984825,5,Fleury,17/06/2022,"Arrived yesterday 6pm a bit of noisy traffic on the cobblestones especially on this public holiday here, lots of locals walking around. But as soon as night arrived it was much calmer, we had a very good night and this morning very calm in this great place just on the banks of the Douro.

82491,987864,4,azulejoscamp,21/08/2020,"Contrary to the initial description there is no longer any lawn, but the possibility of parking on the visibly recent cobblestones and spending the night in a motorhome. Great view. Possibility of swimming in the duoro. Weak point: the 5-star hotel right next door: in the middle of August this generated cars passing all night long: therefore a means of sleeping so sensitive to the noise of cars and walkers."

82724,1389792,5,lobosolitario13,01/08/2021,"Very quiet area they only charged us € 10 with electricity, the great staff super friendly and helpful, also super professionals with a lot of activities, the showers are not much but enough. The town is close and the people are very friendly. We ate at the Aguasriscas Restaurant, 100% recommended, beautiful view of the nail reservoir. We will be back"
82724,1362283,4,pelorojo,25/07/2021,"Level parking area with light, in July next to the tents of a scout camp, with which you share services; at night there was silence. It is in a beautiful place for excursions."
82724,1331236,2,VALLESCOM,16/07/2021,"It is a nice place with good facilities, but that weekend there was a Boy Scout camping and there was a tremendous mess of children. The camping was next to the parking lot and this is part of the same enclosure. I think, since you pay, there should be a bit of control, because it was worse than being on a summer campsite."
82724,1316879,4,HooLee,12/07/2021,Level squares. For € 10 / vehicle all services including electricity. Helpful and friendly staff. They have multi-adventure activities.

82724,1167410,5,RSoftware,04/04/2021,"Again open and 100% functional. Ten euros per vehicle / night, including 220 V. Many camping establishments should learn from Uñaventura, instead of going against the camper; if they don't take care of their customers they will lose them."

82724,1001998,5,carpin,25/08/2020,"Great place, a great roll of the people who run it and multi-adventures. All services for camper and AC must be passed to know how well it is."
82724,998523,3,Archiespacio,24/08/2020,"Without pain or glory but to visit the Sierra de Cuenca it is an economical place for a motorhome or tent with light, cutrillos bathrooms that meet. Good environment for star excursions. With hardly any shade. Summer Covid ok. € 10 car with light, call before because they do camps for kids."
82724,996578,5,ERI86,23/08/2020,"A great place with light, filling and emptying of waters, showers and toilets. Very friendly owners. € 10 per night even if you do the Uñaventura activities. Many spaces and very quiet. You can do 2 circular routes without moving the car. One of 9 and another of 3 km. A great site."
82724,992254,5,gtluque,22/08/2020,"Super good, highly recommended and familiar. 10 euros per night regardless of the people. There is emptying and filling. They are starting with the camper world.

A place of luxury, a beautiful meadow where you can have the dog loose (as long as you watch it, of course) and choose the place you prefer. The van costs € 10 and includes light.

It is a hostel with camping area and adventure activities, and even if it does not have specific services for Motorhomes, it does have water and electricity points, included in the price. Price, by the way, very good, since they are only € 10 per vehicle regardless of the occupants and dogs (you can drop if you are pending)"
82724,436071,2,pepamonde,03/03/2019,"Very expensive place, 10 euros per person and without any service for motorhomes. Narrow road to enter. Beautiful views and quiet place. We will not be back, it is not a campground it looks like an area but very expensive."
82724,323406,5,EncarniMG,09/08/2018,"A great place to unwind. The attention from Manuela and Jesus welcome you as a family are charming, the facilities are right. Ideal for multiadventure with great professionals!"

82750,2218120,4,Sobert,11/08/2022,"The RV park was packed. We opted for this car park. Without boños or clotos (there is adocesped). There is a cemetery opposite and a sports center next door, where there was a camp and there was no disturbance. Although we witnessed a fight which divided the group, but luckily they knew how to manage it. We saw 3 fires. There are no sources. Bars very close."
82750,1363967,4,AritzAB,25/07/2021,"We slept there and it was very quiet, alone, it was Sunday. Despite being on the side of the road, no cars passed. The area was top notch. The place is well located and close to the village."

The sanitary facilities are very clean and flooded with light. The cleaning lady listened to Spanish music while cleaning, it was very authentic :D The view is a dream and the beach is within easy walking distance."

82793,3093979,5,IreaM,07/08/2023,"We spent three wonderful nights at this campsite with the van. 5 minutes from the beach along a path and 20 from the center of the town of Zarautz. Despite the number of people there, we didn't hear any noise (we were in the middle of the campsite). Good views towards the sea, Zarautz and Getaria. We paid €34.5 per night."
82793,3063598,1,BeaDi,02/08/2023,"Terrible. Chaotic allocation of space, a back and forth, it would be easy to organize here with few resources. Unfriendly staff on top. Avoid in high season."
82793,3062558,1,PeeweeVan,02/08/2023,"NOT RECOMMENDED! They don't answer emails or even the phone, and when they do they don't speak English. Not recommended if you are traveling with children because despite telling you to show up at the reception at a certain time, they bounce you despite their directives. It would take very little to be more organized."
82793,3059364,1,esip4062,01/08/2023,"The campsites in this area are ridiculous, most holiday parks don't accept tents or vans"
82793,3045768,4,Guiboule,30/07/2023,Pleasant campsite near the ocean (7 min walk). Clean toilets.
82793,2960518,4,Raxel,13/07/2023,"Correct camping, squares not very large but well-kept, good atmosphere and clean bathrooms. Two people and one cost €28. The girl from the camping bar is very nice and the guy from the surfboard rental is also very nice. The best thing you can do is go directly from the campsite to the beach and on the way back you wash your board right when you enter."
82793,2941458,4,WB97,09/07/2023,"Very nice campsite and a more pleasant way to the beach than the upper place (: However, at €39 per night it is quite expensive (€10 of which electricity costs) and relatively small pitches, but everything is clean and friendly."
82793,2936938,3,nohahaha,08/07/2023,"Nice campsite and good location, but a bit expensive. Lots of young people, which can sometimes make it louder at night. sanitary facilities very clean; you can not reserve."
82793,2914562,2,trioplus1,02/07/2023,"Quite expensive for very small pitches (with camper). We paid almost € 40 per night and you stand on top of each other, as if it were a parking lot .. Too bad because the view is beautiful if you are on the right side. The campsite is not directly on the beach, it is still a bit of a walk, about 10 minutes but is fine. Showers / toilets fine. Unfortunately only lukewarm water to wash off."
82793,2897234,5,chrisandacampervan,27/06/2023,Great campsite with easy access to beach. Staff friendly and great atmosphere onsite. Facilities basic but very clean and well kept. Decent size pitch for campers. 35€/night in June for camper and 2 people without electric.

82793,2373717,4,enzohuber,15/09/2022,Better than the Grand campsite. The way to the beach is shorter and not 1000 steps long. Both young and family audience. There seems to be a split. Families are higher up. Chocolatin and coffee are very good and cheap. Sanitary facilities clean depending on the time of day.

82793,2226625,1,MeriNye,13/08/2022,"Denigrating treatment (from the receptionist to the owner) by the campsite staff. We are the parents of a baby and at 5pm in the afternoon, in the middle of a bridge weekend, they kicked us out of the campsite for no reason, simply to not let a car in to unload things. We had never encountered a similar situation."

We have been treated badly from the beginning. He asked to speak to management and the manager came out and told us to leave the campsite. We called the ertzantza because they didn't want to give us claim sheets, they were kicking us out for no reason. We do not recommend it at all."
82793,2199991,4,MickDosSantos,08/08/2022,Spectacular location! But you have to be early. The beautiful beach can be reached on foot in about 10 minutes (without climbing the stairs). Overall well-kept facility. Recommended.
82793,2195824,1,andretortt,08/08/2022,"The WORST experience ever. 
We were shocked by how rude the staff was, not customers oriented. 
The staff refused to set us up with electricity for the van after we agreed with the camper next to us to use their plug, it was a win-win, we were willing to pay more (we needed it for our laptops to work).
NO WIFI !!! ; Bathrooms could be better, the location is nice, the electricity grid is not available in the whole camping.

What a shame, I´ll never come back."
82793,2191810,5,Patriziamitz,07/08/2022,"Phenomenal parking space, super clean sanitary facilities, very nice reception and briefing, some parking spaces have forecourts with wildflower meadows and an unobstructed view of the 2.5 km long Zarautz Bay! Perfect for surfers, approx. 10 minutes walk to the beach. Absolute recommendation (campervan without electricity 33 €/night). Mini shop available. Holiday feeling guaranteed! Safe place, lots of children and a relaxed atmosphere!"
82793,2181530,3,JeanneChesneau,05/08/2022,"Very nice view and access to the beach by bike path in 5 minutes. Very nice spot for surfing and superb beach. A snack bar to eat on site, very warm welcome. Negative points: excessive price (41 euros for one night in a motorhome with electricity for 2 adults and 1 child) and a pitch not far from a wastewater treatment plant... (this does not concern all pitches)"
82793,2137592,3,arlenebaart,28/07/2022,"Frankly quite dissatisfied with the campsite itself, but the atmosphere was good and the location perfect. Because my friend was very ill with 30 degrees in bed in a parking lot, I was looking for a campsite quite urgently. Everything in the area was full and this campsite was our only option. The day before they had already indicated that we had to come back the next morning. When I called them that morning to ask if they could do something for us / put my name on the waiting list, this was impossible according to the gentleman on the phone and I really had to come in person. Even after explanation, he did not want to do anything. So I walked for half an hour to put my name on a list, only to be told that I only have to come back at 13:30. He couldn't guarantee anything. So at 13:30 I walked again for half an hour and then waited there for another half hour in the hope that there would be a place. In the end this worked, but it is really a very worthless system. In addition, you pay €37 per night (campervan + 2 adults) for a campsite with cold showers."
82793,2101358,5,Howls01,21/07/2022,"They do not accept reservations, quite full but we found a place. Small pitches but it is worth it for the environment. Super correct services. Great beach 10 minutes down a beautiful path. Walking 15/20 from the center. Great atmosphere. Incredible sunsets."
82793,2086396,5,anamungar,17/07/2022,Highly recommended. We decided to stay at this campsite because of its easy access to town and the beach. We got a plot with spectacular views of the sea. We paid 36 euros for two people with the van and electricity. The facilities are very clean and well maintained.

82793,2039507,4,latronconeta,05/07/2022,A very cool campsite near Zarauz. A 15 minute walk from the center and with a direct descent to the beach. Very green and shady and with a lot of atmosphere. Perfect for a surf and beach weekend. For 2 people with 1 van it costs us €26 1 night.
82793,2031126,5,marina11v,02/07/2022,"Best option, by far, if you want to surf for free in the summer in Zarautz. Small van 1 person for 20 €, the blue area is worth 20 € this time. There is restaurant, not very expensive, according to the quality. But not community cuisine. Youngsters at the surf camp can only be there until 11am at the most so there is no noise problem. Nice campsite with lots of greenery. Very limited wifi."
82793,2016734,3,Sabsi87,27/06/2022,"In itself quite nice but actually more for young people, since very loud music until 11pm and the smell of the sewage treatment plant, we unfortunately have to confirm - depending on the wind, really nasty.

Showers (warm) and toilets are clean, electricity is included in the price, the surf camp is quiet from 11 a.m. Large sandy beach, great for surfing (about a 5-10 minute walk). There is a lot of traffic in Zarautz, but there is everything you could need and there are beautiful streets."
82793,1455847,3,linette1108,14/08/2021,"€ 25 per night for 2 adults in a van in high season. Access to the beach very practical for surfing, the shower temperature is very VERY random. If you are young they will put you in the ""young"" corner of the campsite which can be noisy at night. No reservations, you have to arrive at 9 am and put yourself on the waiting list."
82793,1373458,2,Ignalaura,28/07/2021,"We arrived yesterday afternoon and they gave us the k8 plot, right in front of a treatment plant. The site is great, the plot is large, but we have stayed inside the van all the time since there is a very unpleasant smell from the treatment plant. We went to speak to the receptionist to ask if a change was possible and his dealings with us were very rude (saying this plot was highly sought after etc). In addition, we arrived at 19 in the afternoon, and he told us that if it is the first night we had to leave at 12. So if you want to spend a night (or more) in a high standing campsite (€ 36 / night), this is NOT your site."
82793,1372313,5,Maktedelic,27/07/2021,"A bit expensive, but you get everything you could want. Clean sanitary facilities (there are even hot showers!) Direct beach access, breathtaking sunsets, young, lively crowd. The baguette costs 1.55 euros. The service is impersonal but professional. You can walk to the city center in 15 minutes. Fortunately, the area is not suitable for large RVs."

82793,1023247,1,Txeperdins,03/09/2020,"Total disappointment, we were going with the idea of spending three nights and we had to go. Upon arrival, the receptionist did not ask us anything, nor how many days we wanted to stay, not even if we needed light. He assigns us a plot, dwarf, without shade and attached to another van. When I say stuck, I'm not exaggerating, I couldn't open the door without touching the things on the next lot. We have gone."

82793,859894,4,Estadokanibal,10/07/2020,"They did not let us choose a plot and we ended up at the end of the motorhome area, where there is a foul smell from a nearby treatment plant. The camping is beautiful and well distributed. Twenty-year-old bottlers in one area, thirty-year-old surfers in another and motorhomes in another. Without anyone bothering anyone. The beach is ten minutes away on a wooded path."

We regret very much not to return again because it caused us a deep disappointment. This enclave does not correspond to what your link says. We do not consider it to be a motorhome area, it's just a closed campsite ... although we, the users of similar vehicles to those that resemble the old hippies, are educated enough clean and social to have a similar place to those who, on the other hand, consider themselves wealthy. We would appreciate to enjoy this wonderful site as it is Zarautz as well as the latter where access to the nerve center"

82793,352226,4,joanjo,24/08/2018,Nice place with beautiful views. The bathrooms are pretty good and there is a washing machine. You can go walking to the beach and follow the catwalk until Zarautz.
82793,296444,3,surftraveller,22/07/2018,Camping in a panoramic position overlooking the sea. even if it is the closest to the sea it is always a bit far to transport the equipment. many surf camps but quite still. In any case in Zarautz there are no other solutions (the other camping is very far from the sea at the top of the hill)
82793,295443,5,freeridevan,21/07/2018,"Camping with terraces where almost all plots have views. Surfer atmosphere. Quiet night (we have been during the week). Access to the beach by a road. Beach is very good for surfing, with children maybe better towards the center of town. This one has a red flag many times but it weighs less during the day. Facilities well. Wear leggings to level. Maybe just for big campers"
82793,278578,3,cedpollux,01/07/2018,"Camping very well placed, with beautiful views, 5 minutes from the sea on foot by a flat path, however the price is quite expensive 35,90 € / day in high season (a motorhome, 2 adults and 1 child) then be careful a lot of surfcamps in the campsite, it can quickly become very noisy in the evening. After it is very well placed, pay attention to grassy sites that can become very quickly muddy in case of rain or thunderstorm."
82793,275747,5,busbusCH,26/06/2018,Very professionally run campsite with stunning views of the sea. Mainly teenagers in tent camps and surfers in Vans. Sanitary facilities and restaurant top. Really a great find!
82793,274374,4,smoerrebroed,24/06/2018,"Nice campsite, mostly tents and campervans. Very clean toilets, nice staff. Despite felt 100 youth groups at 23 o'clock everything was very quiet, only the noise from the sea was still to be heard. Surfer spot."

82801,2594575,4,tim2thetop,01/03/2023,"We stayed here one night. It was very quiet and no one else was there except us. The holiday home settlement also seems to be largely uninhabited at this time. Despite this, the parking lot was illuminated all night. There were bins for plastic and paper. There was no indication of payment here, or parking meters."

82801,1540698,4,VitoAngel,02/09/2021,"Very good place to stop, there are usually more motorhomes, it is quiet and you have the beach next to it. That is if to get a place in summer or you park in the early morning or late afternoon as it fills up."

The beautiful is the quiet beach that has a beach bar in case you want to eat! The parking itself is nothing ... a parking lot, but it allows you to be very close to the beach at 3 minutes walking. The beach showers are in the beach bar area. Few people on the beach!"
82801,655541,5,eguzkienea,24/08/2019,Great site Lovely beach next door. beach bar. the piss at the bottom ... level. Silence at night Please do not camp. let's leave it better than before coming.

82801,615466,5,mits76,10/08/2019,"As the rest of the users indicate, a good place to spend the night and enjoy the beach during the day, in a quiet place, against the fact that there is no supermarket or store nearby and that you have to come after the beach day because The parking is quite full.

82801,300161,1,JHaring,25/07/2018,All in all a nice place to stay close to the beach but there are millions of mosquitoes they make it impossible to sit outdoor.
82810,2774360,2,tiagoduque28,22/05/2023,"Badly maintained park. The grass is not cut, having to walk in tall grass.
The bathrooms and showers looked like they were not cleaned in weeks. Floor filled with dead mosquitoes. Mirrors and sinks filled with bird excrements.
The place is filled with mosquitoes due to the strong lights at night and proximity to river.
Very bad experience."

82810,1884847,2,PetziLanz,12/05/2022,"Was here one night. The place is very neglected. On the pitches everything full of undergrowth. Price 10€ plus 5€ electricity plus 5€ water!! However, water and electricity at every place, so 2 stars. I couldn't use the water disposal because everything was overgrown by undergrowth and plants. At night everything full of mosquitoes. It may be that the place is better maintained in summer, not in May!"

82810,380093,4,cimberian,23/09/2018,"In these days of September we have spent two very quiet nights. The river beach is pretty well equipped, although the beach bar is closed and the lifeguard service has ended at the end of the season. The only problem is that it is complicated to combine shadow with a good inclination ... Hehehe"

82842,2828265,3,WillSexton,07/06/2023,"Big easy car park adjacent to beach. Great views and you can swim or walk into town.

Not rated higher as it's a bit busy (we weren't bothered) and we weren't there on the weekend so the nightclub was quiet.

The lighthouse was quiet."
