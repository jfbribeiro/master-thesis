92036,3184669,5,jumiclea,20/08/2023,For the night of August 18 to 19. Very nice site and beautiful beach. We slept well but the sound of the waves can be heard!
92036,3182650,5,Elilya,19/08/2023,Very nice spot! The feeling of being alone in the world! The only sound was that of the waves and the wind…. Who could still disturb during the night … I recommend ++

92036,3142994,5,SaraGG,14/08/2023,Quiet and beautiful place to spend the night. We have come in August and it was empty.
92036,3120395,3,alexpec,11/08/2023,the beach is very good and the town is good but to avoid from August 8 to 12 they are holidays and they are dedicated to trying to spin through the parkins hahaha
92036,3088307,4,Filipe1985,06/08/2023,"Quiet place to spend the night, safe, clean. There is plenty of space available. Very close to the beach. The place during the day is very popular for hiking and the Camino de Santiago. Nearby there is a supermarket, coffee and hot bread."
92036,2956228,5,lumenamelie,12/07/2023,Super place sea view without anyone around us access to the very pretty beach. Small local shop to help out. Dogs accepted. Lots of wind though
92036,2866242,4,RuliVanLife,18/06/2023,"We spent a very quiet night here, on the beachfront and accompanied by other campers. They told us that they were going to start prohibiting the area for motorhomes"
92036,2849677,4,Phil10kn,13/06/2023,Small quiet village. On the seafront. Perfect for one night.
92036,2678763,4,frannetpat,18/04/2023,"Right in front of the ocean. Quiet, alone with the sound of the waves .... Perfect."
92036,1697787,4,anjocores,25/11/2021,Secluded but serene and calm place. All year.
92036,986593,2,stevestainton,21/08/2020,"Peaceful night, just the crashing waves for company."
92036,639734,5,anjocores,18/08/2019,At the foot of the sea Not badly attended. Country people and comfortable fishing. A Romanian / Gypsy lady is asking for money. Just tell him that you do not mind. Safe and very nice place in July and August.
92036,400019,1,alena,27/10/2018,"Nice view but we did not stay because badly attended (a woman who has begged us many times for cigarettes and money insistently, until banging on the camper)"
92043,658413,3,Sissi33137,25/08/2019,"Nice view, to go for a swim you have to go behind the yellow sign. Closed from 5 p.m. to 7 a.m."
92043,316287,5,evi,05/08/2018,"Everything you need just day, close at 7pm"
92060,2321902,2,xan173,30/08/2022,"It's a three car layby on the road, with access to a footpath for walking around the lake shore. Not a suitable overnight place, but okay for a lunch stop as per the original poster."
92116,3106779,5,Nightfamily,09/08/2023,"Wonderful stopover for us in a rooftop tent. Superb break in the middle of nature, next to a pretty chapel. Walkway so a little busy but extremely quiet in the evening. We were alone. Drinking water nearby and garbage cans. Close to a road but little traffic. If desired (CC?), hard parking on the other side of the road. Very charming. Places we love!"
92116,2234139,4,jorda,14/08/2022,"we spent a very quiet night with shadows. The only drawback is that we wanted to do the greenway by bike with the children and bicycles only for pedestrians are prohibited. For the rest, the place is very beautiful."
92116,1527651,1,8usti,29/08/2021,Bad experience in this place. We scratched and punctured the wheels of several vans and motorhomes that we spent the night in the place.
92116,1281930,4,laspescadillasviajeras,27/06/2021,3 0 4 seats at most. Very quiet place and nature to the fullest. In my case I have a bad experience and not because of the site but because of a local who told me that we slept for free and we made everything dirty. Greenway that leaves from the same parking lot.
92116,1272369,4,salando1213,23/06/2021,"Nice place, and shaded but do not come too late because frequented. A few walkers, little traffic on the road. And there are many toilets, if you deny walking 300 meters on the path!"
92116,1162582,5,kiwionavan,01/04/2021,Highly recommended. Attention to the access because the entrance is a bit narrow (especially for motorhomes) but no more problems. The night is completely quiet. Beautiful views and greenway to touch for a nice walk

92116,1114197,5,richywhl,10/11/2020,"Peaceful, quiet, lovely spot. Local walkers about, no problem and the road has few cars passing by. No toilets, just a water tap(no screw thread). Recommended."
92116,1060919,5,dosage23,20/09/2020,Great spot. Lovely and peaceful. No problem staying overnight. A little busy with walkers but no big deal. The ideal spot to immerse in nature

92116,823921,5,Azkunaga,14/06/2020,A quiet night next to the hermitage and the stream. Ideal place to climb Mount Betsaide or the Arrazola greenway. There is a source. Highly recommended to go with children.
92116,708876,4,chrimilitole,30/09/2019,A beautiful place is located on an old abandoned chapel. Very quiet and enough space for 3 campers.
92116,695952,5,Gauthierbaywindow,18/09/2019,"Outstanding spot for the Spanish Basque country. Under the trees, in front of the Pyrenees, departure of hiking, water available. Next to a small chapel."
92116,626537,5,Jule0612,14/08/2019,"Really lovely spot, felt real save even as solo female traveller. Stayed for a night would've stayed longer if l didn't had plans"
92116,617604,5,odreymouch,11/08/2019,Nice shady place with very good ballad to do. drinking water and trash cans and toilets a little further down the road after the hermitage. very quiet place to leave clean please.

92116,390634,5,Michal_Zrubecky,09/10/2018,"Nice, quiet place. Toilets, water, what more can you wish? And the sheep's bells work as a lullaby."
92117,3240361,1,Clabalos,30/08/2023,The police have orders to lower all the folding roofs although this contravenes DGT regulations. You have to give up because if they can't touch your nose but it's clear that this council is bought by some campsite that wants you to pay. Regrettable.
92117,1323992,1,Nosotros1234.,14/07/2021,Galibo maximum 2mt

92127,1520508,5,Pamplemoussedu53,27/08/2021,"Absolutely magical place, which is generally rare to find at the water's edge. The lake is perfect and super clean for swimming. The police have passed but seem to tolerate the vans / campers parked in the area."
92127,1475671,5,molly95,18/08/2021,Great place to stop the night
92127,776985,4,Michixxx,06/02/2020,This place is now deeply under water in winter.
92127,640893,3,mickpamg,18/08/2019,"A beautiful overnight stop without services.  There is no shade.  We stopped up at the cafe near the dam wall where shade was available until 7pm then drove back and found a level spot, we were soon joined by 3 other camper-cars. The water is cool and clean.  Lovely listening to the carillon bells echoing across the lake."
92127,613872,5,karlarach,09/08/2019,"Beautiful place, quiet and clean, it's great with dogs. Thank you for sharing!"

92127,569809,5,Hans0815,22/07/2019,"Agreed, wanted to stay one night, came back for a second.  lot's of little pesting flies but a little led light 20m away from the van keeps everyone happy.  lovely location, nice for swimming or u can rent a kayak ."
92127,479686,5,sccile,09/05/2019,"One of the best places of our trip. Magnificent view, calm and freedom assured. The area is very clean, the walks numerous. A church chimes in the distance, it is not unpleasant. Thank you for sharing !"
92192,2403650,3,brachychitum,26/09/2022,"It is a very quiet place, even in summer. You can park anywhere in the town where they don't fine or say anything, both at the top (El Carmolí) and at the bottom (Punta Brava). The regular beach for bathing."
92192,1751302,4,redadoree,09/02/2022,Just stopped for lunch. Very quiet mid week. Clearly someone is cleaning up the beach as several skips full of debris and no smell noticed. Maybe getting ready for Summer season. Had the odd military plane doing manoeuvres over head whilst we were here but otherwise quiet. It is right by basketball net and playground so may be busier in evenings and weekends.
92192,1427085,1,Koriviajera,09/08/2021,It is a parking lot with a park for children who play ball until 12 o'clock and at night it becomes a meeting place for young people until 5 o'clock in the morning. We couldn't sleep.
92192,1024830,4,sanz,04/09/2020,"This place is right next to a small playground and for him many children by day and at night the not so children turn seventeen up with music and boces until two at night and the beach the sand looks like silt and it smells Bad us We no longer bathe because you can catch any disease, how it smells, it is a shame because the water of the minor sea encumbers us"
92192,753412,2,patandjonontour,14/12/2019,Flat and quiet parking. There is no portable toilet in the off season and the beach front is under construction. As well as this the sea water is a bit stagnant and there are lots of mosquitoes. We stayed only for lunch.
92192,496789,3,chrisomz,30/05/2019,"No water at the tap, no background and it stinks. Circulate"
92192,446035,3,Xarifa,29/03/2019,"Small car park used by surfers and dog owners during the day. Currently there is a construction site. It was quiet at night. Too bad that the Mar Menor resembles a cloaca, it did not smell very pleasant."
92199,3216985,4,arinakevinvan,25/08/2023,"Calm and a lot of place. We didn’t sleep there but did a laundry 4 euros to wash and then 1,5 to dry only cash paiement"
92199,2317837,4,PCPotheke,29/08/2022,Cannot be reached with a camper over 9 in length.
92200,1897620,2,ronjawanderlust,18/05/2022,"When we arrived, all the outside seats were cordoned off. The train can be heard quite loudly. The next morning we knew why the pitches were locked/kept free. From 8 a.m. it was high life here - probably some kind of event or the preparation for it. :D We felt uncomfortable... Unfortunately, we can't really recommend the place."
92200,1870673,5,SauseSusi,05/05/2022,Nice place right on the water under lots of trees that provide shade.
92200,1680554,5,bebber123,06/11/2021,Loved it I kinda was thinking g going to San sebastian way to crowed it so I drove here just excellent.
92200,1288948,2,kalvidaniel,01/07/2021,On the roadside now they park motorhomes
92200,701888,3,DieReiseRitter,23/09/2019,"A parking lot, which is located directly on the street, is already alright. Right full daytime. Nearby there is a playground. 2 nights were ok."
92200,328399,3,Dandi,12/08/2018,"We spent one night. There is a restaurant so we were not alone, there was racking in the parking lot and there was another AC. The train did go by often."
92200,317254,5,Mathis84,06/08/2018,We spent a very relaxed night there. Also make a break very suitable. There are no trains at night. A small nice restaurant right on the parking lot.
92203,2278048,2,I-Castillo,21/08/2022,Weekend night very noisy.
92203,667602,1,Orcera,30/08/2019,I do not recommend spending the night in this parking at all. The boys and girls give a lot of fuss as they are with music and squealing. He doesn't deserve a star.
92203,414472,1,sorginetxe,16/12/2018,The parking is fine but many cars are concentrated at night to make BOTELLÓN We are looking for another place to sleep in some more distant streets
92222,3153379,5,SENTIER25,15/08/2023,Clean and very quiet place (a few cars at night). Nice point of steps.
92222,3069973,3,hayash-dump,03/08/2023,magnificent view of the lake and dam. Small walk to be carried out below the car park. a little passage in the evening for the sunset.
92222,2732383,1,Sandrine33600,07/05/2023,"I could not stay because too many mosquitoes, May 6, 2023"

92222,2556180,5,PedroMints,20/01/2023,Good path and very quiet spot. Van with 7.15
92222,2378682,5,rb007,17/09/2022,"Very quiet, paved lot overlooking the lake. Attention difficult access for large cc. Well deserved 5/5 rating."
92222,2084661,5,MattCC,17/07/2022,"Magnificent view, garbage cans available and very clean place. we had a nice quiet night. A car passed in the night without being a problem. There is a free telescope to observe the landscape and the birds. However, do not venture there with a large motorhome or truck because the access passage and the road are narrow."
92222,2020707,4,Nugget1310,29/06/2022,"Beautiful view and great space. We were alone here until a few cars came and was quite noisy until 2am. Otherwise we had a good night here, which was also totally quiet after leaving the cars."
92222,1965292,5,nico001,10/06/2022,This is definitely the nicest place I slept in my trip through Portugal. Wonderfully quiet beautiful walks and MTB rides just wonderful.
92222,1731499,5,MissSchwertfisch,10/01/2022,"Really beautiful, the small hiking trail along the lake is also wonderful... However, the place is well frequented, many cars, on weekends you are only alone at night. ... Approach also easily feasible for wide and high Mobile."
92222,1664917,5,MitchFD,27/10/2021,"Amazing spot. 

10/10 !!"
92222,1526094,5,AntonioDamas,29/08/2021,"Clean, straight, spacious, at night only me is a camper, very dark at night nice views of the dam, AC very wide and long can go but watch out for the bushes"
92222,1113413,5,vanessinha,08/11/2020,This place was amazing!!!! The view is incredible and the ground is levelled. There is a nice hike nearby. Felt very safe and had a good time! Would definitely come back!

92222,1080695,5,iveco89,04/10/2020,Quiet and very peaceful. we spent one night without any problem. good for walking and observing nature. has a local craft store. nice people
92222,1017617,2,LynnBruyeer,31/08/2020,"Lots of cars stopping by to take a look at the view, which makes it a little uncomfortable to camp here. Not our favorite spot despite the beautiful panorama and lovely walk across the lake."
92222,599234,5,legallf29@gmail.com,04/08/2019,Quiet place
92222,370398,5,pij31,11/09/2018,"Superb paved desert parking, beautiful panorama on the lake, actually we had 2/3 mosquitos in the evening but it goes. no one at night and no noise, attention access from the village can be complicated with a big camping car"
92257,2438782,1,jmviking,12/10/2022,This place is not found or does not exist anymore??
92276,2441374,4,Consolos,13/10/2022,"Out of season (October 13) it is literally empty. We have stopped to eat and it is full of parking lots. Parking meters are off, and most businesses are closed. In the sculpture of the glasses we have seen 4 or 5 parked ACs. The beach is wonderful."
92305,324756,1,tedjuju,10/08/2018,Really sloping it is imperative pair of hold. Stray dogs all night long. Also place of nocturnal love meeting of the population. So not so quiet.
92307,3282085,5,noelia9889,10/09/2023,"Land with spectacular views of the entire coast, better than those from the beach parking lot (which is next door) because it is higher. At night there are street lights nearby. The only drawback is the unevenness in the part closest to the sea, and that the terrain is somewhat irregular. We spent two very calm days, except for a storm at night (be careful, a stream forms in the center)."
92307,3228253,5,Ariel76,28/08/2023,perfectoooooo. he sleeps well.
92307,3192109,5,Israman,21/08/2023,"A great place at the foot of the sea, next to a beautiful beach. The seafood restaurant also eats great. We slept on 8/18, and we arrived late in the afternoon and we were almost alone, with 2 other vans. Highly recommended."
92307,2991196,5,mosquitovan,20/07/2023,"in the afternoon many cars, but at sunset it is empty. bathrooms during lifeguard hours. camping nearby. Incredible views. somewhere level."
92307,2948852,1,chark7,11/07/2023,Impossible to get to the place due to the number of cars. Monday afternoon in July. Outside of summer it can be a good place. Protected area. No dogs
92307,2944062,5,HuberAlfred,10/07/2023,"Nice place in the preseason. Stayed here in June, it wasn't busy. It may be busier in peak season. If you're already there and see rubbish, you can pick it up and take it with you. Respect the locals there."
92307,2864478,5,coporado,17/06/2023,"We had two wonderful nights, totally quiet, great views of the sea and beach. Police came by but didn't show any interest in us. The beach bar is great, delicious food and nice service. It was difficult for us to say goodbye to this dream place. We didn't want to leave at all."
92307,2401369,5,mfmoujan,25/09/2022,"Highly recommended. We spent the night very quiet in front of the sea, there were some other motorhomes in the area. In addition to this place, 100 meters away, there is the beach parking lot that does not have restriction signs and next to it another space where there were also other caravans."
92307,2222965,5,ppmixa,12/08/2022,"Great spot facing the sea where we were alone, unlike the village just after armored. The little beach bar is nice. Shower and toilet at the rescue center"
92307,2067780,5,astienarritaud,13/07/2022,Very nice place that must be great for the night! Magnificent view
92307,1795160,4,Lepanto666,25/03/2022,"Theoretically there is space for up to 20 vehicles, but the space also serves as a parking lot for the adjacent restaurant (which is good but not cheap). When the last guests of the restaurant have left, it becomes quiet. Great views, showers and toilets not operational in winter."
92307,1747227,4,thomassz,04/02/2022,"Beautiful place, beautiful night but toilets locked during my visit"
92307,1688904,5,bebber123,14/11/2021,Absolutely stunning views of the ocean ac welcome next to the beach mega location
92307,1528083,5,CasaBilidi,29/08/2021,Very nice site to spend the day and the night. We are 2 AC and a van. It is best to park 100 m further than indicated on P4N.
92307,1466191,5,Ziortza,16/08/2021,A natural paradise. A super quiet place to spend the night in the first row of the sea. We have been surprised by the few AC and fires that there are for the wonder of the place. There is a beach bar and services open from 11am to 8pm.
92307,1451648,5,tiritos,13/08/2021,Perfect site. We spent the night alone looking at the sea. There are more AC and campers around. Good atmosphere and the sea breaking next to you while you sleep. Very top
92307,1451639,5,DaltonF,13/08/2021,Beautiful place! Quiet and you can sleep comfortably overlooking the sea. There were ACs and vans and plenty of room to park. We were alone spending the night in front of the viewpoint of the beach. We will repeat!
92307,1365019,5,Diemate,25/07/2021,"Despite having many people with their vans and AC, the place is very large and you can be very quiet. No noise and the sunset is very beautiful. There are toilets and showers on the beach."
92307,1090484,5,LINUSSUNIL,12/10/2020,"Super nice place with great sunset. The terrain is a bit uneven, but it is not impossible to set the car upright."
92307,1055349,5,faurys93,18/09/2020,Many places for parking because there are 3 successive car parks after the beach. We slept well there!
92307,921943,5,asturmano,02/08/2020,"I was with my 7.5 meter long motorhome on a wonderful esplanade Saturday, August 1, absolute tranquility and great views of the sunset. And no noise, some fisherman who occasionally came at night."
92307,693787,3,Turtlesontour,16/09/2019,"Amazing views over the Atlantic, perfect sunset and in early September we shared the big space with only 1 other camper. The terrain is quite uneven and could be an issue with a low clearance vehicle. The beach has toilets although closed when we were there and a beach shower."
92307,654359,5,DOMMOBILE,23/08/2019,"Arrived on 15/08/19, CC 7.40 m. Super top. Very nice beautiful beach setting. We bathed and we fished. So good we would have stayed for a second day but the clouds were there. Resto not tested because closed tonight of 15/08/19 ...."
92307,645496,5,Juanitocompras,20/08/2019,"Incredible place. Easy to reach We arrived on a Saturday afternoon, and soon we were completely alone. Do not park attached to the Civil Protection booth xq in the morning they park an ambulance. If you want to go out on Sunday, do not delay muxho, because at lunchtime it is already full of cars and it is impossible to maneuver. Spending the night here is delightful. Only the sea and the noise of the waves. Wonderful. Showers from the beach a few meters away. Restaurants nearby, but you have to book on the weekend."
92307,317431,5,Gaelle-Jeremie,06/08/2018,1 night spent above the cliff. at the sound of the waves. Great. restaurant nearby (not tested).
92308,1037511,1,Carlosycarmen,09/09/2020,Regrettable. Two or three parking spaces next to a work that seems abandoned and with a slope that makes it almost impossible to level.
92308,644029,4,Cachuete,19/08/2019,"Very calm, easy to access. No service, a little downhill but nice for a night and very close to the monastery."
92308,519767,5,boby21,18/06/2019,"Quiet night, no lighting better than the parking area"

92321,3160482,4,happycamper18,16/08/2023,Stood here one night. Was good so far. Level course on slightly sandy bottom - the beach is great and the waves come in very nicely. There is a cold shower with a drain (shampoo can be used) across a small bridge. It actually smelled a bit like fish - it's just a harbor and a fish factory next to it. But it was bearable.
92321,2934187,4,javyalonso,07/07/2023,"Good parking to spend the day and go to the beach in Peniche but the smells of fish, especially in the afternoon, are horrible. I don't know what it will be like to sleep here."
92321,2872065,3,philruli,19/06/2023,"Quiet and huge parking, close to the beach. No signs of prohibition. We spent here 2 nights without problems. Only downside: depending on the direction of the wind, the smell of the near fish flour factory is kind of disgusting."
92321,2657566,3,galerna_van,10/04/2023,"We stopped only to go to the beach. It is a large open field, with delimited spaces, easy to maneuver. The beach is across the street. Next to the highway and port, the views are not pleasant. There were several motorhomes and vans, of surfers and families. It's fine if you're looking for a beach next door and don't mind not having a nice setting. In the town we saw many more places to stop."

92321,2118866,5,cleachpn,24/07/2022,"We spent 2 nights here. The parking lot is large, busy during the day but never crowded with people, the second night we were the only camper but we had no fear. There may be fishy smells (Peniche lives a lot from fishing) but in view of the humidity and the freshness, it is not disturbing to close the windows. We strongly recommend this city, which is very pleasant to explore, especially by bike!"

92613,3162652,1,kstephensnider,16/08/2023,This is not a good spot. It slopes and is much more narrow of a space than in the photos and would not recommend this for a vehicle without 4x4. Drive further south towards Sammiguel and you’ll find some better corners and more spacious places on the side of the road. Sad we never found Calvin the Cow but we did see Hector the Horse.
92613,2888292,5,eufecio,24/06/2023,It is very good to spend the night and take a walk. very natural and good views. thanks for sharing. there is 4g

92617,683907,4,Sypi,09/09/2019,"The point on the map shows Calle Diego de Riano. We spent 3 nights in early September under a tree at the end of the street. The neighborhood is quiet, a little circulating at night. No hostility from Sevillians, rather smiles and friendly ""ola"". The blinds are useful because the lamps of the city shine all night. It is a very good plan for who wants to visit the city on foot."
92617,580612,5,coraliejames,28/07/2019,"Relatively quiet location for the location, very well located 5 minutes walk from the Spanish Steps and 10 minutes from the city center. Had a day with 1 night for 2 euros."

92620,2119647,4,Nirvacid,25/07/2022,nice place to wake up indeed! sound of frogs at night. however we were awakened at 4:30 am by the starting of an engine (water pump??) then again at 8 am. it makes a lot of noise but only lasted 10 minutes each time. the place is clean. provide wedges because the ground is not very flat.
92620,1994194,5,LaetiandBapt,20/06/2022,"Magnificent spot by the river, calm and relaxing. Be careful only for vehicles over 6.5m, or big guys, maybe go and see the track before entering, it is difficult to turn around. But if it does, it's definitely worth the detour. Thank you for this spot"
92620,1961010,4,parkermav,09/06/2022,Very quiet place to stop for a night. Lots of pleasant animal noises! In the morning some shepherds arrived who refilled the troughs for the animals with a pump that made a lot of noise. They greeted us and there was no problem. the road to get there is feasible by any means but the flat place is not very big. Maximum 2 vehicles <6.50m
92620,1849444,4,trippyz,24/04/2022,"when we wanted to go to this spot with Waze be careful, it made us land on the other side of the river... at night we were still 20min from the spot when we thought we had arrived.. other side we could park in the parking lot of an unoccupied Casa rural. Just for the night and without leaving any trace of our short stay. none of the passing vehicles bothered us."

92646,1432986,1,DiegoPontitero,10/08/2021,"At first it seemed like an ideal parking lot, with plenty of space, views of the estuary and quiet ... until at 2 am (on a Tuesday) a group of kids stood by the side to make a bottle with the music blasting. We had to move to another place in the middle of the morning because it was impossible to sleep."
92646,1417390,5,JuliaRafal,07/08/2021,Very good site. The barrier is not up so you can go through. To walk in the morning is VERY NICE!

92662,881917,3,danielsky,19/07/2020,Plenty of shade so nice place for a break or quick nap but seems a bit loud from the highway. There were some fences around the building and part of the picnic area maybe due to renovation.
92662,352946,4,fourways,25/08/2018,"Shady. For lunch break. But people are disgusting, there is a garbage can and everything is on the floor."

92671,3135779,5,Henrrubi,13/08/2023,"Lovely place to spend the night. Stunning views and no light pollution. Ideal for seeing the stars. To spend the night, if you arrive in the middle of the afternoon, they close the access and you have to wait until 9:30 p.m. for the bus to leave. The lighthouse has a bar."
92671,3127482,5,MonikMap,12/08/2023,"It can be accessed around 9:30-10pm but it is advisable to wait until the last bus from the lighthouse leaves. Very narrow road. We spent the night at the foot of the lighthouse, without problem, with a few other vans. Very quiet place."

92671,2943874,5,eilisenda,09/07/2023,"Perfect place to sleep peacefully. Arrive after sunset, as it fills up much earlier and they leave afterwards, leaving a lot of free space. We have slept in the light of the lighthouse and with a blanket ☺️ highly recommended. Take care of the environment and do not leave garbage or toilet paper!"
92671,2931605,4,Hikuda,06/07/2023,"Good spot, but furious madness between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. on July 6th. We told them to come and see the sunset! Result of cars everywhere, sometimes parked 20 cm from the vans! Once the compulsive sunset drinkers leave, the place calms down."

92671,1565115,5,JuanD,10/09/2021,"Ample dirt parking to visit the lighthouse. It is very crowded, so it is advisable to arrive early or late. It gets pretty messed up with traffic. Highly recommended for the views and tranquility"
92671,1300055,5,Lulustucrululu,06/07/2021,"Super cool view. Possibility of walking up a bit to admire the sunset. The parking lot is clean.

92671,989888,5,natalye,22/08/2020,The place is beautiful and it is very quiet. You have to arrive before 7pm because people are going to watch the sunset and the parking lot fills up. There is a little bar where you can have a drink. It is very quiet. In the morning you can go down to Cala Viola and take a bath
92671,947121,4,Silvia2220222,10/08/2020,"We have not spent the night but we have parked before it was sunset time around 6 pm and we have had a place without problem. The entrance. The access ramp scratched us on the way down, apparently it is not so high."
92671,942142,5,rancan85,09/08/2020,"It takes a little patience to go up the top because of the people who come to see the sunset ... an hour to make the climb! Not arriving before 10 p.m. is no use! On the other hand, the place takes the effort ... small parking lot at the foot of the lighthouse, just sublime! Few people despite a full month of August. Very calm. No shade on the other hand."

92678,3209726,2,martetamandarina,24/08/2023,"A hell of mosquitoes, very dusty and without shade. The good thing about it is the starry sky and that it is close to the lighthouse to see the sunset.

92678,2332728,2,alberp71,02/09/2022,"I see it a bit dark and lonely to stay. Without a doubt, the beaches are incredible after a walk and descent. A house puts a large spotlight that illuminates the east side of the parking lot at nightfall, dazzling and making light pollution to see the skies. Very wide and going up the ramp almost to the entrance of the path to the beach there is a small area where the focus does not reach."

In August it gets crowded because everyone goes to the beach, so his thing is to go at dusk (after 8 or around) or first thing in the morning.

92682,2670300,5,JuliaCT,14/04/2023,"We have come down with an L3 H2 without problems! Very quiet and perfect with dogs, there is a ""beach"" right next to it."
92682,2526228,3,nicochalu,22/12/2022,Difficult to access in the winter season. Tried with a smaller vehicle maybe.
92682,2055766,4,Lysie64,10/07/2022,"Quiet and uncrowded for a month of July. 500m down the road to the left coming from huesca. Easy DC and van access. Well shaded place and more isolated from the world than on the other side where people bathe. Perfect for dogs too. A few kms from the Mallos de Riglos circular hike, to do! 2 places at the water's edge, 2 others on the way if necessary."
92682,1975139,4,Vito111extremaydura,14/06/2022,"a wonderful place, lonely and very quiet. with direct access to a mini beach. we spent the day with friends and at night we were alone. the only bad thing was the mosquitoes, there was no way... take care of these places!! :)"
92682,1899278,5,Jorijn93,18/05/2022,"Pictures of the large parking space are not at this location! 

Besides that it's a very nice secluded spot, probably not suited for larger campers. Waterfall nearby where you can swim."
92682,1684974,4,fabiscamperlife,11/11/2021,Indeed a really beautiful spot. Next to the little river a nice leveled place with a lot of shadow. Only negative is the road nearby. But at night there is nearly no traffic
92682,1546367,5,oriolserna,04/09/2021,We have spent the night alone and very well. Relaxing the sound of water and very good temperature. We thought it would be difficult to climb the hill (VW California 95) but no problem. We had to collect beer cans that were lying there. Please take care of the sites.
92682,1474684,5,parkingterralta,18/08/2021,"Without services, very quiet!"
92682,1470471,5,LauraPollo,17/08/2021,"100% recommendable. We have spent the night with two vans (kangoo i trafic) and it is marvelous. In total silence and next to the river, ideal to cool off and relax. A 10!"
92682,519392,4,Dimass,17/06/2019,"It is accessed by a descent of land only suitable for cars or small van. I do not know if the access is better in the parking lot on the other side of the road. The site is very good and the pool gives many points, but if the river does not carry much water the area becomes a wetland full of mosquitoes, hell. I imagine that in another time it will not be so exaggerated .."
92682,380773,3,alexnaval,23/09/2018,Very quiet place but access a bit bad
92682,333820,5,cedfran331974,14/08/2018,Quiet in nature on a grass parking access a bit difficult but the stop is worth every side of the road at the bridge you will find natural pools where you can swim.you can spend the night there if everyone respect the site there will be no restriction
92706,2944064,1,SwenSo,10/07/2023,"Unfortunately, driving tests with the motorcycle at night like on a race track. otherwise it would be ideal to spend the night here. Next time somewhere else."
92706,2602861,4,sandrasailor,08/03/2023,I slept well here. There were still some campers. The ferry to Lisbon is super relaxed. There was some messing around with cars in the evening by youngsters.. I didn't feel threatened by this... They were also gone when the sun went down.. When I went to Lisbon I parked the car a little closer to the ferry terminal. Left it there with peace of mind.. I'm happy
92706,2575603,1,fvela,12/02/2023,"I do not recommend at all. It stinks and it's dirty. Traces of drifts all over the parking lot, bottles of alcohol that are everywhere and, as a bonus, techno music in the middle of the afternoon. I'm going somewhere else! Too bad because it's next to the ferry and free on weekends"
92706,2567484,5,Blaidelta,03/02/2023,"I spent two nights here in the Parking (€1.20 per night) to visit Lisbon with the ferry (€5.80 round trip). The entrance is a bit narrow, pick up the rear-view mirrors that hit the barrier. Don't park near the ferry a lot of noise. The first workers' cars arrive at 6.30am and make noise on the cobblestones. Site without problem!"
92706,2544316,4,DouglasCosta,06/01/2023,Ample paid parking with a beautiful view of Lisbon. Flat floor. Easy to use ferry to Cais do Sodré in Lisbon. We stayed 2 quiet nights
92706,2527013,2,Prorom,23/12/2022,It is best to park in the middle area on the left after the very narrow barrier entrance. Then you are still behind the cars but illuminated at night. It's dark on the right at night and the village youth is often up to mischief there until the morning. Security service approx. Mon-Fri 9am-9pm. Great starting point for the ferry crossing to Lisboa. Last ferry back at 23:15! Timetables maintained in Google Maps.
92706,2483826,4,Fairpkay,05/11/2022,"Perfect parking for visiting Lisbon. During the week, the ferry usually runs every hour (€5.50 return). Overnight stays (without camping behavior) are accepted. Parking is free on weekends. I felt safe"
92706,2458881,5,Tini2012,23/10/2022,Perfect for a trip to Lisbon. We spent two great nights there. We would definitely recommend. We were there over a weekend in mid-October. The ferry goes regularly to Lisbon and costs 5€/person round trip.
92706,2410554,5,Teamfrulo,28/09/2022,"Perfect parking for a quiet and cheap overnight stay and to take the boat to Lisbon in the morning (15 min.). You pay the boat /- €2.5 pp per boat trip. Parking is free on weekends. We arrived on Sunday morning and left on Tuesday morning, paying only 1.2€."
92706,2346696,4,Miguelbg,06/09/2022,"Narrow entrance but our 7 meter nasturtium entered without problem. We took a ticket but when we left the barrier was open and you don't pay. There was no AC but we slept well one night, Monday through Tuesday. Some cars making some noise but not until late. Perfect place to catch the ferry to Lisbon, 5 euros round trip with bicycles"
92706,2332872,5,maltemussinsBett,02/09/2022,Very relaxed car park to stay safe for a day. There is a fast ferry to Lisbon for €2.50 :)))))) I highly recommend it! Day ticket only €1.20!!
92706,2031183,2,arlenebaart,02/07/2022,"Great parking for the day, but no sign for motorhomes and there was no one in the booth to request. No campers to be seen, we did not stay overnight. Very narrow passage indeed."
92706,1880744,4,miketmarina,10/05/2022,"Accessible by 12-meter coach, on the other hand very tight entry because of the terminals and barrier it passes by being straight. Oh yes, ask the lady at the counter, the barriers are open from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m. on weekdays and from Friday 9 p.m. to Monday 9 a.m., so free. For HGVs at the back of the car park, mobile barriers allow you to exit without going through the cash desks."
92706,1827535,5,AAAlexandra,16/04/2022,"Very nice place, very beautiful and free on weekends and holidays. There are mosquitoes at night, good to have repellent."
92706,1736051,5,CarolaHofstee,17/01/2022,"Great spot for visiting Lisbon. You can take the ferry that runs frequently. Despite a sign that says no campers allowed, just talk to the person in the little cabin at the entry. It felt safe, not too much noise at night."
92706,1715210,3,Hardy59,24/12/2021,"Stayed 1.5 nights. The first night with the romantic sound of the sea and a fabulous view of the illuminated skyline of Lisbon. The second night with the romantic sound of the sea, a perfect view of Lisbon and from 2am in the morning deafening music, squeaking tires and New Year's Eve roaring of the male youth. We left shortly before three ..."
92706,1713686,4,stevewoods,21/12/2021,stayed 2 nights absolutely fine. easy trip across to Lisbon
92706,1130564,5,SANDROCUE,14/01/2021,"As a resident of Seixal and a regular user of the car park, I guarantee that there will be young people with music until late, and eventually some drifts of young people who are discovering life right now. It's a place where young and adults park to relax and be at ease every day. It is an excellent place to stay overnight, flat, with a panoramic view over Lisbon. 
You are very welcome :)"
92706,989805,2,aannikala,22/08/2020,"The possibility to take the ferry to Lisbon is optimal and super easy. Spending the night here isn't great on a Friday night, though. Young people are standing everywhere, listening to loud music and speeding their cars across the parking lot. It may be different during the week, but on the weekend it was really very loud until about 1-2 o'clock at night"
92706,759111,5,ikom,29/12/2019,I add the schedules so as not to wait 1 hour on a Sunday
92706,735160,1,mfgwien,01/11/2019,"DON'T stay here if you want to sleep! Most horrible night we ever had in our camper. Just see other negative comments, it will happen just like this also weekdays!
car races, people making party until 5am."
92706,727572,5,jfgire,22/10/2019,"An excellent choice to visit Lisbon. Quiet parking (if you go side beach opposite the pier), cheap, beautiful environment and Lisbon is 25 minutes by boat and cheaper than a tram ticket. Much better than the other pier (Almada- Cacilhas)."
92706,677467,3,arrirriza,05/09/2019,"Ideal for visiting Lisbon, € 1.20 parking per day, river ferry to Sodres (Lisbon) leaves you at the foot of the Alto neighborhood and the station is in the Ribera market"
92706,534438,4,Sportman55,30/06/2019,"We spent the nights of June 22nd and 23rd and they were quiet, with some noise from a nearby nightclub but the transfer of cars was not excessive and without bothering too much. To visit Lisbon we find a very good option, having a 15-20 min boat to the center of the city."
92706,527991,2,Jerry_Maguire,25/06/2019,"Worst night ever. Some Ravemusic event nearby, very loud until 3 am in the night. On top some locals started racing with their cars in the rows of the car park with big crowd cheering at 1 am in the night. Very unexpected on a Monday night. At 5:30 am commuters came in every second to use the ferry. Would not recommend for a quiet sleep."
92706,520440,5,Elternzeit,18/06/2019,"Excellent view on Lissabon and just wonderful to arrive with boat at the heart of the city. Takes around 20 min max. Parking is hugh, calm and safe. If stayed two nights from Sunday to Tuesday and paid just 1.20€. Highly recommended."
92706,485396,5,tessoliekan,16/05/2019,"Great spot. quiet nights and more campervans there. The ferry just takes 10/15 minutes and costs 5,40 for a return ticket. the parking is 3 euro's per night! but free in the weekend."
92706,480264,1,Chrisandliz,09/05/2019,Good for the ferry to Lisbon but incessant loud music disturbed our stay and made it unbearable.
92706,471325,5,BayernSchorsch,29/04/2019,"Everything perfect. open on Sunday barrier, on Monday then ticket for 1.20 € received from friendly parking attendant. Since the commuters come to the ferry in the early morning, it is advisable to park in the right part at the very back. you do not hear cars. Otherwise perfect with ferry to Lisbon"
92706,451226,4,JuergenD,09/04/2019,"Perfect for visiting Lisbon. On Sunday the barriers were open. The ticket for the exit was then on Monday afternoon for 1.20 € at the nice gatekeeper. It was quiet at night, and tomorrow the working people came by car."
92706,445187,4,Gernimobil64,26/03/2019,Great place relatively quiet you only hear the ferries
92706,406556,5,germany1,11/11/2018,Perfect parking for campers at the ferry. Ferry directly to the center to Lisbon. The price is 1.20 euros for 24 hours. free on weekends. The barriers are put up Friday night. Very quiet at night.
92706,400236,5,kim1250,28/10/2018,"Great spot, we felt very safe to leave the van whilst we took the ferry across to see Lisbon. It was free to park at the weekend and we paid around 10 euros for two adults return to get the ferry. Ferry ran till 11pm and pretty much on the hour with a break over lunch time I think."
92706,391882,4,scubasteve0827,12/10/2018,"Arrived around 8pm, parked on the far side of the lot, away from cars near the ferry entrance. The office was still open, I asked (still €1.20 / 24 hours). There was a soccer game going on in the distance at night; peaceful sleep to sound of waves, no issues. Some joggers in am. Cheap easy for touring Lisbon. Felt safe. Can bring bicycles. Toilet in ticket building, after purchase."
92715,2547547,3,javeasteve5,09/01/2023,"Spent one Sunday raining night here as had morning appointment in JC Parracho over the road.  Basically a muddy waste ground, near to a restaurant that closed at 19.30hrs on Sundays.  Rubbish bins available only.  No shade, out of the way, slight road noise but quiet night."
