85872,2864685,5,atat732,17/06/2023,So peaceful and stunning views over the reservoir. We were all alone once the local day trippers had gone home which was lovely. Very very hot already in June but the water is really refreshing for a swim. Constant buzzing of thousands of bees and ants everywhere. No facilities so make sure you have water and everything you need.

85872,1703253,5,Consolos,05/12/2021,"Quiet night like few others. It is far from everything but it is an ideal place to rest. There is a sign that says EL RING, and just before the sports center there is a dirt parking lot on the right and at the entrance of the center, 8-10 large asphalt spaces, more or less leveled. Very beautiful views and an ideal place to pass as a safe rest."

85872,1113960,3,dani_photo,10/11/2020,Good place if it weren't for some vans who disturbed midnight with music and laughter! What a lack of respect.
85872,1085766,5,Mariosk8cc,08/10/2020,"A great place for water sports, windsurfing, kitesurfing ... The best wind is from the north, better to go out with the kite from the beach of the menbrillares and with the Windsurf they leave from the edge of the ring facing east, you need permission from hydrographic confederation of the care tajo"
85872,964046,4,z4l1y0,14/08/2020,We sleep alone in the parking lot. The civil guard passed by and told us that there was no problem spending the night here. We saw a family of deer and some other animal. Let's keep this site safe.
85872,911250,5,ptmas,30/07/2020,"I was there on 07/17/20, the first thing I thought was that surrounded by swamp, the mosquitoes were going to eat me but nothing further! I was lying on the ground most of the night watching the stars and not a single one bothered me! Very nice views, you can take a dip in the swamp and there is a good sky at night. It is a huge esplanade, I was completely alone. Highly recommended Take care of him!"

85872,449190,5,Estebanico9,05/04/2019,"Stayed early April 2019. Fantastic views all around of reservoir and mountains and very peaceful. Pitch consists of small rocks and is spacious and flat. You can get permission to visit El Anillo, a ring-shape building with even better views. About a km away is the dam with a bar with snacks."
85872,442695,5,gilreymond,21/03/2019,Beautiful place. Absolutely quiet. Fantastic view left and right to the lake and to the mountains. A place to stay. It pays to branch off from the freeway for one or more nights.
85879,3166708,1,Turrius,17/08/2023,"Apparently it is a common cruising spot, not recommended. I went on a weekday, and it was a very murky atmosphere."

85898,1498429,2,Monderland,22/08/2021,"We did not spend the night, we stopped to eat and spend the middle of the afternoon. They do not control the capacity ... maybe before, but the subject has already been forgotten, and with the masks and the distance more of the same. At noon well, in the afternoon there were too many people and some children playing ball almost on our towels. The site itself is fine, you have to pay € 3.50 even if you consume to use the pool. Has toilets and showers"

85898,1086177,5,Makixu,08/10/2020,"The place is perfect, the town is very small, only a bar and if you go without food, buy to cook before in Lerma. In the town where you can spend the night there are no food stores"

I asked the people if it was drinkable and say that it is they drink at 9 and at 11 the baker passes through the center of the town and at 10 the fisherman more or less ..
85910,2816768,5,annaizqui,03/06/2023,A great place to spend the night. You cannot go to the picnic tables with the car. But there is a parking lot with great views. Peaceful place.

85910,562562,5,debycoles,19/07/2019,"Loved it. Absolutely silent overnight. Lots of bunnies running around the picnic area. No services except bins. Up on a slight hill over looking the town and lovely countryside. The town is very much worth a visit, as is the cathedral and tower, updated in 2019 for the millennium anniversary of their saint. Plenty of parking available in town."

85921,2155428,5,bigotek,01/08/2022,"Night spent next to the church in calm and cool. 4G. Clean place to leave in the state, to spend a peaceful moment!"
85921,641053,3,BRETAUDEAU,18/08/2019,"Parking that seems private. We stayed at night with the agreement of the locals, who seemed to be the owner of the place. I think we did a favor."
85922,750711,1,alexgs76,07/12/2019,Day only. Closed at night
85926,3206333,1,LauraGu,23/08/2023,"They have put up a sign prohibiting access. understandable seeing the state in which all the space and the margins of the track are, full of papers and poo...!"
85926,2974161,4,ggt22,16/07/2023,"Difficult access, although when we left we found a much easier alternative route. It is not 100% level. We have been very quiet, alone in the middle of July and it is highly recommended to spend a night. In the morning many people have passed exercising."
85926,2695596,1,Louna2023,25/04/2023,There are signs everywhere along the way that entry is prohibited because it is private property.
85926,2240591,5,Seyra46,15/08/2022,"Access is easy, it has several and the place is great. The only thing that during the day is crowded by people who go for a walk, take their pets, bike, run..."
85926,1999488,1,regorsnas,22/06/2022,Impossible to access even in 4x4. The locals informed us that in summer there are queues of vehicles trying to access and they get stuck in the same place as us.
85926,1888751,4,Nadine112,14/05/2022,We had the beautiful place to ourselves. There were only occasional walkers with dogs and cyclists. The night passed without any problems.
85926,1831322,4,miride74,17/04/2022,"Good spot in SUV. Attention not accessible by motorhome (at the limit at the very beginning of the path. Quiet at night, many mountain bikers and walkers during the day."
85926,1816459,5,arnaucarrillo,12/04/2022,"PROS: clean, nice, quiet place and easy to get to (easy directions). CONS: road with quite a few potholes (we came by car), many bushes and in the morning/afternoon people pass by because it is close to the town. Of course, the nice people and do not put hits or anything. We will repeat without a doubt!"
85926,1813596,3,icalvor,10/04/2022,"Access to the site, as other park4nighters indicate, is VERY DIFFICULT. With a T4 we sweat the rigorous kilometer between potholes, roots and bushes to finally reach the grove. Although it is very nice and quiet, the land is completely sloping, so without levellers, sleeping without slipping off the mattress is complicated. I honestly don't think we would go back."
85926,1724008,4,dontpanic,02/01/2022,"I spent a very quiet night here. There were no signs of trash so maybe people followed the advice of the last commenter. :) It's on a bit of a slope so it requires levellers. The dirt access road is narrow with some overgrown shrubbery, so not recommended if it bothers you to scratch your van. The path is quite rutted so larger vans could have issues when leaving (uphill). Keep in clean! :)"
85926,1701686,5,PaNeu89,02/12/2021,Was here for a nice and cozy night. Just a thought: Everyone of us has garbage bags with them. So why dont we just pick some up and make the places we so enjoy nice for others to visit. This way we campers may also become more welcomed. Just a thought...
85926,1646204,1,AngelikaSchmidt1972,15/10/2021,Quite overgrown and very dirty!
85926,1564164,5,sabil,10/09/2021,"Very good place, crowds pass by and bike but it is a place to relax. Go through some of the urbanizations to get there, and then take a narrow path on the right. Until we reach Piñadira. is the bard in the photo. Lasai lasai ein dou lo! worth it"
85926,1438566,5,JavierH1,11/08/2021,A perfect site. Pine forest with lots of shade. You have to go to Calella and put it on the GPS to go the easiest way in 5 min. Medium vans only. No services but great
85926,1430560,1,VoyageurReveur,09/08/2021,"Impossible for us to access the place. We took the tracks with the camper van, it is narrow, rocky and the vegetation is quite dense. The indicated path was blocked for the fall of a tree, end of the story."
85926,1393803,4,Wolfie7,02/08/2021,Quiet nice place to sleep but very busy in the morning by people with stray dogs.
85926,1354477,5,IndiavsIrene,23/07/2021,"Easy way by van although it is true it can be scratched (we do not care). Is it clean. We slept alone, shaded and level. A bucolic place Perfect for night and day"
85926,1336562,5,sistemabinari,18/07/2021,Perfect for 4x4! Ideal to spend the night. Extremely quiet!
85926,1316994,4,xeniaturon,12/07/2021,"Access a bit complicated, on one side of the road there is a fallen tree, but it can be reached from the other side. Quiet place with a lot of space, you have to find the position well so as not to have a lot of slope. In the afternoon and in the morning, many people walk and cycle, at night very quiet."
85926,1294465,1,DavidCirauqui,03/07/2021,Very difficult to access and it was not flat enough to sleep
85926,1250252,3,Suki,12/06/2021,Quiet place even though it is somewhat difficult to get there since the dirt road is quite damaged.

85926,1165797,4,xavalpe,03/04/2021,Esplanade with trees that give a lot of shade. We just stopped to eat but it looks good. We have left because there were already many vans. I walk somewhat complicated but accessible
85926,1108643,5,florencephamruellet,29/10/2020,"Suoer quiet spot, a few passers-by but nothing disturbing Very flat"
85926,1025238,5,platanitoybistec,04/09/2020,"It is a very big move to get to this site. But it is worth it. We went down a dirt track of about 10 kms and horrible. After all the odyssey and scratching the van all over Laos ... we managed to reach our goal. The super quiet place to sleep, in the morning there were a lot of people walking and running. But the place is great for summer because the trees give a lot of shade and it is very cool. The next day we discovered that we were entering an urbanization just 100 meters from where we were and a super manageable dirt track."
85926,874933,5,Archer101,17/07/2020,"Beautiful spot, plenty of space to park up nice and flat with evenly spaced trees, perfect for hammocks. The Camino is very small and difficult, lucky we had a 4x4. only downside is lots of cyclists and dog walkers."
85926,871869,4,jpcat65,15/07/2020,"Nice place, calm, obliged to clean the edge of the road with a secateurs to cut the brambles. If you continue 50 meters further there is another location where you can turn around. Remember to clean up even if you were not the one who left this waste."
85926,861275,4,eliguerrero,11/07/2020,"From Calella de Palafrugell it is easy to access, at least by van. Maybe if it rains a lot the road will be more complicated. There is plenty of space and shade, also cool for tents and hammocks. In the evening and in the morning a lot of people passed by running or walking the dog, but the police did not come. Be careful not to make a fire, as the environment is very dry !!"

85926,650780,5,carrho,22/08/2019,"Super, calm and clean. Practicable only with a van because a fallen tree now blocks the way (take gently on the right, there is the short width necessary to pass.) Frequented in the morning, we were alone for the night"
85926,617910,3,xvlun,11/08/2019,"From the camí del jardín botanic we could not reach the spot. A fallen tree was blocking the way and the way looked more suitable for 4x4s. Maybe access is easier from the dirt road starting at Cap Roig Senderisme bus stop, but we did not check because of a festival. We checked the spot out walking and it looks ok."

85946,3192943,4,Luke839418,21/08/2023,"Great pitch, perfect sea view. Have you slept well the night. Another couple who have camped. Sea very rough - rather less suitable for small children. Maximum 3 parking spaces for vans. The millions of small flies are annoying - very annoying and that's why we are looking for a new parking space. Perfect sunset"

85946,2942646,5,FlavienO,09/07/2023,"Place with a beautiful view of the ocean and very popular with travelers. Place rocked by the wind during our night. However, many passages in the evening and at sunrise. No theft to report during our night."
85946,2866447,5,colosseumax,18/06/2023,"Small esplanade of hard earth with views of the sea, it does not fit more than 3 or 4 vans at most, and there are only 1 or 2 good places to stand parallel to the sea. However, on the road that arrives there is a lot of place to stop, parallel to the pedestrian walkway through which people usually pass. Beach with algae and rocks but very pretty. Cobbled access road with some narrower streets but OK"
85946,2849390,5,French_Ludo,13/06/2023,"Nice and calm place in front of the ocean.
Safe place"
85946,2717744,3,crilerosi,02/05/2023,"We don't recommend it. The place is very small, as soon as there is more than 1 van there, it is difficult for the residents to turn around. We felt comfortable with Mitchell. A lot of people walk by on the boardwalk. The area is nice but to be honest we had really nicer places to stand (undisturbed). The approach is several kilometers of cobblestone and really narrow."
85946,2639070,5,dieRiedls,04/04/2023,"It's a parking lot in the nature reserve and a really nice quiet place to stay. There are roads here that are very narrow, but there is also a somewhat larger one. We were three vans. The pilgrims march past here."
85946,2516419,5,lenny.btv,08/12/2022,"A single flat spot, magnificent view and sunset, feet in the water"
85946,2301318,3,danieltime,25/08/2022,"pretty cool spot ,however if you have a larger van don't try and come down here the roads are old 18th century cobblestone and very very narrow."
85946,2292051,3,Loccc,23/08/2022,"to get there you have to go through quite narrow streets. upon our arrival there were 5 other vans parked. the beach is next to it, too bad it was full of algae. continuing on the walkway you arrive in the village where you can have breakfast. we slept well but nothing special"
85946,2224658,1,Malikou,12/08/2022,"❌Careful thefts ❌ We stayed parked for barely 1 hour in the middle of the afternoon, we were on the beach right next to it, just long enough for the window to be broken and some very important things to be stolen! We strongly advise against it, the neighbors told us that thefts are very very frequent to this place"
85946,2145957,3,bensib,30/07/2022,"Indeed, we were robbed and broke a window. It's a shame because the spot is great with access to the beach and a very beautiful sunset. If you go there, keep your vehicle in sight."
85946,2142246,1,FranciscoQuiros,29/07/2022,Good place. But I found a French that had been stolen in the van. I don't recommend it to anyone. Portugal is fatal with robberies
85946,2120648,5,LouiseVignon,25/07/2022,"Great spot! very nice view of the sunset. To get there go through Moreiro, there are quite narrow roads but passage by Van is possible. A bit of passage in the morning from walkers."
85946,2120034,4,lesbellesconnasse,25/07/2022,Very nice view of the sea and the sunset. Accessibility probably difficult (beach attendants park on the access road). Quiet and clean. Bars/restaurants very close.
85946,2093889,5,sarayespinosa29,19/07/2022,"Very nice, we woke up with a lot of fog and we were able to go for a walk on the beach with no one."
85946,2072186,5,millowsli,14/07/2022,"We stood here one night. Very busy during the day but enough space for us in the evening. Very quiet yet safe, a few joggers and fishermen in the mornings. Great sunset! A small bar with drinks and food is within walking distance to the right and left!"
85946,2049534,5,ArthuretLauler,08/07/2022,"Quiet location with stunning sea views, perfect for sunset lovers!"
85946,1993016,4,leont266,19/06/2022,Nice place. Quite a lot of people turn around during the day but it didn't bother anyone that we were there. Stayed 3 nights.
85946,1930720,5,CyrilT6,30/05/2022,We had a great night. Quiet area at the bottom of a small dead end. The view is very pretty. I recommend.
85946,1927351,5,Jonathan-b,29/05/2022,"We stood on the street, great spot right on the sea, quiet and safe. In the morning some anglers and hikers arrived. Access via cobblestones through a residential area."
85946,1861304,5,romxanlea,30/04/2022,"Great place in the middle of nature!!! The calm, the sun and the kindness of the walkers. Also perfect when you have a dog, No cars passing by is the best!!"
85946,1832699,5,migueligr,17/04/2022,"The site it takes you to only fits a van or motorhome, but just before entering that marked site you can park well and sleep without a problem, it is not a noisy area and the sea is right next to it (first line), it is good to rest."
85946,1800948,5,lubinkenneth,30/03/2022,"Beautiful spot, but to get there...
Just be aware, they not invented asphalt roads yet."
85946,1790470,5,katistoff,21/03/2022,"Since the spot was occupied, we parked on the street, but it was also very nice. Nice way along the stand. Many Camino de Santiago hikers. Nice place!"
85946,1767557,4,emiliedunn,27/02/2022,Really nice place to spend the night in front of the sea. The place is quiet and it is near to a little village (6” walk). We had a beer and some bacalhau croquetas in a really nice place called Taskuinha
85946,1754670,3,Dacostaknust,13/02/2022,Great view from the stand. The drive through the village is only suitable for narrow/small mobile homes. It's very tight in some places.
85946,1752172,5,mariestmn,10/02/2022,We parked here for one night and it was very beautiful directly at the beach. Not space for many vans because the floor is more steep but we loved the place!
85946,1686805,4,34clo,12/11/2021,Indeed it is not very clean. But a superb spot directly on the beach. not very far from Porto by car. only it is better a 4x4 because where it is the flattest it is in the sand.
85946,1331211,1,Thibald,16/07/2021,The place has become disgusting. we preferred the adjacent street
85946,1245706,4,HandH74,09/06/2021,"All the comments are unfortunately true ... very dirty, lots of condoms. 3 cars (couples) came at nightfall to do their business. They saw us, they turned around. Otherwise the place is quiet with a magnificent view, I recommend it for 1 night! No water"
85946,1114861,4,alexbbbbb,13/11/2020,"Indeed there is natural pee waste blah blah, but apart from that, great place, quiet, nobody, facing the sea, we were 2 camper vans 1 van and a tent and we spent a pleasant evening together"
85946,1074482,5,gservais,29/09/2020,"Nice spot, calm, except for the sea of course;-) Access narrow but no problem with a 6m CC. No police controls, ever, according to a regular. Recommended warmly."
85946,1056853,5,Rifter19,18/09/2020,"I spent a very quiet night, a postcard sunset, if you walk a little on the rocks there are Celtic marks is signposted."
85946,1017696,1,ainosbs,31/08/2020,"It could be a perfect place, but it's filthy. Please make people more aware of these things and pick up their trash. For the dirt it's not worth it"
85946,951607,4,georb,11/08/2020,"Very nice place to spend the night. Quiet, during the day people walk on the beach but they don't bother. there is room for several vans."
85946,926128,4,viajamoslibre,03/08/2020,Super nice. Super nice but small parking
85946,857577,3,Mikelaurie,09/07/2020,"The spot is very nice but we arrived on a spot ""pee / poop / condoms"". We picked up everything on 07/09/2020, and it's frankly not pleasant! As the hummingbird legend says, we have done our part. Let's try to do it all!"
85946,717164,1,Samsarace,09/10/2019,"How to say ... just arrived Mr. was doing pirouettes with Madame in his car looking at us through the window, Mr. went away and gave way to another couple who also made pirouettes. Used condoms all over the floor, pieces of glasses and other disgusting waste. The area is very poor in spots so it does the trick"
85946,681708,1,laras,08/09/2019,Don‘t even try from 9am till 8pm because all locals drive to the beach and its a huge mess. we lost 1 hour to drive to the place to see that there is no place. its only one small street and a huge amount of cars who search a parking lot. maybe its nice if you don‘t have that much locals who park in the whole streets. and yes there are really only 2 maybe 3 places. otherwise you annoy the shit out of everybody thats want to turn around.
85946,669744,4,Martin1312,31/08/2019,"Good spot!
Yes there are many cars, but they just turn around. This is the turnaround space of the street. The best at this place is that a lot of funny old boys doing there morning yoga. Really great show.
I would suggest."
85946,643185,4,crischao,19/08/2019,"The esplanade is closed to traffic. You can only park on the side of the road, for vans alone. It has a small restaurant and a beach bar. Very nice and quiet place to spend the night."
85946,600674,1,roofdog,05/08/2019,"The place is too loud and possibly unsafe: noise from aircraft (apparently direct Einflugzone) and again and again cars that arrive, turn and drive away (some times several times). Was very happy not to have been alone."
85946,545108,4,Matschi4x4,09/07/2019,"Nice place on the beach, a few hikers but otherwise quiet, at least during the week. Around the corner everything is full of toilet paper and wet wipes, too bad that some people just leave their filth behind!"
85946,542689,1,DigDawwwwg,07/07/2019,Don't come on the weekend nightmare and no spaces!
85946,447893,3,peoplecalled,01/04/2019,"The place was ok for one night. However, there are also nicer places. It is clean here, after we have collected a 30 liter bag of trash. Mostly wet wipes and just the usual plastic. The wet wipes suggest why here at night, as here, cars come with couples. Too bad that after the ""fun"" they can not take their trash back, but throw into nature."
85946,407159,5,KanttiAdvanture,13/11/2018,"Really good place to stay couple nights, no facilities but calm and peacefull area. We spend here 3nights. don't drive on sandy area,  we get stuck and broke our powersteering pump. Otherwise very good place!"
85946,394979,4,baudge,17/10/2018,"Nice for one night, difficult to be all flat, plan the holds if you have. Locals very welcoming who come to discuss in the early morning. Dirty enough surroundings again."
85946,374020,3,renaud74,15/09/2018,"Nice, quiet, unfortunately, the people who bivouack here did not understand how to burn their toilet paper ..."
85946,372789,4,Offroaderlife,13/09/2018,Site with a beautiful sunset. There is a walkway next door that people pass through but at night it is not busy. Recommended
85946,367428,3,Ma2lan,07/09/2018,Nice for one night. Beautiful sunset. Negative points: it is very dirty and we hear a lot of planes.
85946,351040,2,Goofysurfvan,24/08/2018,"Somehow didn't like it. Too many pedestrians passing on a loud wooden walkway and staring at you. No place for table and chairs and weird cars passing at night although this is a dead end. Beach showers a bit of a walk away, but this is not the most beautiful beach."
85946,347212,5,Lorilein,21/08/2018,Perfect for a day at the beach. Not a lot of space but extremely beautiful.
85946,339567,4,Seaman,17/08/2018,"Very good spot for the night and enjoy the beach. Summer is best in the morning or in the evening because there are many cars during the day, which makes access and parking difficult (do not cross). As there is little parking, the beach is quiet."
85946,321636,4,AKELA2032,08/08/2018,"Very nice spot! For all types of vehicles. No shadow !!! Near amenities that the village offers. Tobacco, bank, restaurant, bar and 45 minutes walk to shopping center. Big jig difficulty to turn around. Quiet night. PLEASE KEEP THE SITE CLEAN, THINK IMAGE THAT WE LEAVE AT THE PREMISES! Burn your PQ or put it in the trash ... Visual pollution never pleasant !!! Enjoy"
85946,321034,5,CaptaineCaverne,08/08/2018,"Nice beach, I had a good night without problem, a little walk and some mosquitoes"
85946,319167,3,jukerbri,07/08/2018,We stayed for several nights. The place is a bit noisy. Many van come to sleep ... we ended up with 11 vehicles one night! Be careful not to arrive too early on a good day ... access is difficult because many cars can park on the low side.
85946,314235,5,amandineray,04/08/2018,"Super spot, cool and with great views! We met other people in van and had a great evening together! Do not hesitate to go :) we can put up to 4 vans!"

85946,290100,4,andersaefer,16/07/2018,Good place to spend the night. The only drawback is that it has no toilet or drinking water.
85951,2953359,4,VanyRee,12/07/2023,"Parking near the airport. We left the car here for one night because we flew to Palma. Also slept in the car the next day, everything was fine. We were a bit worried by the comments here, but we can't confirm that. There are only people around who pick up the cars of returning travelers and bring them to the airport."
85951,2531770,5,wanderstruck632,29/12/2022,"Great place. It was empty when we got there and completely filled when we left in the morning. 5 minutes drive to the airport, good nights sleep before a flight."
85951,2509696,3,xondi,30/11/2022,"The ugliest place in the world to park and infested with cars and trucks, rubbish all over the ground... it's like an industrial estate, but this place only aims to park near the airport, so, judging it that way, it does its job well committed without expecting anything else. 6 minutes/3.2 kms from Terminal 1 by car. From here you can see up close even the parked planes."
85951,415866,1,lapetitecolombienne,25/12/2018,Beware beware!! Stayed here in our camper Christmas Eve and somebody tried breaking in at about 5am whilst we were sleeping inside. Our dog barked at them but they kept trying all our doors. Would not stay here again.
85951,404581,3,Puglia,04/11/2018,Difficult to park. There better options nearby. But this is the closest option to the airport. Ok for one night.
85964,3293988,1,J.adan,13/09/2023,"Zero of everything… Free yes... electricity, skids, riffraff, what a pity... the town hall is interested and the urban police are sweating it... in short, don't waste time... Moroccans partying... very very bad combination... never again Balaguer?????"

85964,3139947,1,Manu_38,13/08/2023,"I think it is the worst place to spend the night. I haven't even gotten out of the car. That was the Bronx, even some kids repairing the car taking advantage of the power outlets"
85964,3084535,1,JuanBeteta,05/08/2023,Area well located to visit the town but very noisy young people with very bad appearance around the caravan we had to leave before us five caravans that arrived after us also left we could not replace water the broken taps a shame with how well located it is this
85964,3063264,3,Antyasun,02/08/2023,"AC area well located, free electricity is to thank this City Hall, water out of service, having the Segre river next to it. It's a shame that there are people who don't know how to appreciate this and make a bottle (broken glass in the AC area (danger for children and pets) more control for this type of people who are a minority but make more noise than most civic people. Thank you City hall"

85964,2996764,4,GregorioIbarra,21/07/2023,"Fairly flat and easily accessible electricity is always appreciated. There were only 2 motorhomes when I arrived so no problem parking next to a socket. 1.40 in the morning, a police car too fast next to the caravans. 9 in the morning, the parents who leave the children in the pavilion screaming. Lots of car traffic early in the morning for this reason."

85964,2813132,4,Raulus1980,02/06/2023,All free. Possibility of light in a few places. Very close to the historic center and you can walk along the river with pets. Thank you for these types of areas.
85964,2802339,4,CarolinaCoelho,30/05/2023,"Water service (gray and black loading and unloading), parking and free overnight stay and energy in a very pleasant place with very welcoming shadows in summer. An example of the concern that Spain has in welcoming caravanning. Congratulations."

85964,2575752,3,camidalella,12/02/2023,"It could be a great area, thanks Balaguer. But today there is no water, the gray drain has collapsed and the squares are not signposted, so at certain times they are occupied by cars. Too bad, a little maintenance and it would be 5 *."
85964,2574451,4,dasi67,11/02/2023,"Thanks to the town hall for the area. Today there is no water, there are many movements of cars, living on the street is normal, everything else is correct and the town is beautiful. Thank you balaguer"
85964,2566618,5,aylin_s98,02/02/2023,Great place to do a VE. The water is running at the moment despite colder temperatures. We will spend one night here. The place is well located. In the evening there is some activity due to the adjacent swimming pool.
85964,2563728,5,LysPaul41,29/01/2023,We came here 2 years ago. Everything was perfect. That's why we came back this year since we were passing nearby. Thank you to the city for all these services
85964,2562922,3,melenuo,29/01/2023,"Good place, nice and central, market on Saturdays, bottled music at night, but not excessively annoying, lack of water, possibly due to the cold -4º. Thanks for giving us places like this."
85964,2558295,1,Moldevius,22/01/2023,"Without water! We do not know if it has been cut off due to the cold, a pity because on other occasions everything is ok, we hope it will be resolved."
85964,2557883,3,nora200522,22/01/2023,"The area is very good, there is free electricity, water is closed (possibly due to frost), I read in the comments about the bottle and yes, there was but they were far from us, they did not bother us with the music."
85964,2552314,3,skandol,15/01/2023,"The area is fine, I arrived on Sunday morning and there is no life, everything is closed."
85964,2535234,3,EllenH,31/12/2022,Supply and disposal great and free.
85964,2534883,2,cita81_ds,31/12/2022,"The area is very good, but there was a group of young people playing very loud music and making a lot of noise right where the ac were parked. we called the local police but no one showed up so we opted to go somewhere else. It's a pity that the city council allows these situations."
85964,2533156,5,AzucenaCampo,29/12/2022,We were 2 days. beautiful city. Very good free area next to the river. Very calm
85964,2532460,4,Javiiiigisi,29/12/2022,"Perfect place to spend the night. There is where to empty the WC and there is also free water and electricity. The only thing that is in the same place is a park and a soccer field. But at three degrees there was no one playing, hehe"
85964,2519951,1,Tommy15,11/12/2022,"We did not spend the night because of the comments, we only spent the morning. Nor would I have stayed because of the amount of dog poop there was."
85964,2518781,1,FFICUS,10/12/2022,"We have been there. It is a pity that such a well-prepared place is turning into a breeding ground for thugs, who are only going to get tourists to choose to speak ill of this beautiful town. There is a lack of surveillance by the authorities or even putting up security cameras as they do in other areas."
85964,2500915,5,Kutter2,20/11/2022,We have supplied and disposed of. Ideal to visit the city. We didn't stay overnight.
85964,2448068,2,demahon,17/10/2022,"We were there on October 16, 2022, alone, later all sorts of young people came who positioned themselves right next to our vehicle. It got worse and worse, soon there were almost twenty, not only very loud. Cars and scooters were also parked right next to us. It got very uncomfortable and we left after 7 p.m. It's a shame, more checks should be made here."
85964,2406330,5,Pikridi,27/09/2022,We spent a quiet night here. Nobody bothered us. Supply and disposal worked wonderfully.
85964,2297032,3,cristy01,24/08/2022,very practical because all the services including electricity thank you to the municipality for this large area but unpleasant odors and average attendance around many mosquitoes not stayed the night
85964,2265012,1,PometaVan,19/08/2022,"The camper area itself is fine because it has all the services and it is free, but we have had to leave, like other motorhomes, because gangs of children get together with loud music and there are very strange people and there is no safe place to be seen. to spend the night and less with kids in the van"
85964,2258400,5,VeroMM,17/08/2022,"We have spent a quiet night in the heart of the Segre River, central and all free services, if it is true that youth meet in the park since there is a soccer / basketball court in the same enclosure but for us they have not been annoying, We have rested without any problem, I would return to the area. have a good trip!!"
85964,2221881,4,Pavima,12/08/2022,Clean enough! We just went to empty and fill up. There were teens hanging out and police bothering them… seemed like a really safe place.
85964,2189336,2,miguel_hard,07/08/2022,"The initiative is good, it hurts the little surveillance that there are many cars in the car zones and thugs in the area if there were more police in the area it would be a great area. I give you a star for the light. I did not dare to spend the night."
85964,2076498,3,calepuz,15/07/2022,"The light doesn't go. When I called the town hall, they replied that they would look at it, that they were busy. We were going to eat at a restaurant in the area. finally we went to the Avellanes monastery. Interesting place, quiet and correct menu. Electricity €5"
85964,2046049,3,jflebaron,07/07/2022,"thanks to the city, just for a meal stop, the area is deteriorating. we go to sleep on san esteban de litera."
85964,2025043,1,rififi,30/06/2022,Very nice city.we didn't stay because the locals told us there was a lot of theft and insecurity
85964,1990578,3,Guzzi66,19/06/2022,thank you to the municipality for offering such an area with all the services .... do not leave anything outside at the risk of unwanted visits !!!!!!
85964,1972050,1,MoniqueLaforgue,12/06/2022,very noisy. To be avoided absolutely because attempt to steal the bikes twice during the night.
85964,1912753,4,Brocorakas,24/05/2022,The area is very well located for visiting the small town where life is good along the Segre. Great lawn / walk along the river (where our one year old son was delighted to be able to stretch his legs!)
85964,1904391,2,pit,21/05/2022,"The area has not changed, it is just better known. There is always the noise of young people! On the other hand, no way to drain the gray water, 2 cars parked in front, will they leave?"
85964,1894389,3,Adrienvintage,16/05/2022,"Large parking lot with trees. close to the city center. at the end of the day and the beginning of the evening a lot of noise. Young people from the neighborhood come to play football and play music. No safety concerns, the young people stay together without looking at the motorhomes. the calm is done once night falls. car park without charm, like the city. 3 stars is enough."
85964,1880697,4,nass73,10/05/2022,"Quiet parking, yes there are young people in the evening but after 10 p.m. very quiet. We have not used the services. Next to the river, very pleasant for a walk."
85964,1828630,2,Tronker,16/04/2022,Good parking with free electricity service. During the day there is a lot of traffic of vehicles and people who have a soccer field and make a lot of noise when they throw the ball at the plates of the walls of the field. At night quite quiet. Pity of the filling services that almost no water comes out and the emptying of black clogged. Should have better maintenance
85964,1809911,1,alcasa,07/04/2022,"NOT RECOMMENDED, it is the sports center car park, a place surrounded by buildings and a children's park, it is logical that at night they have a bottle with music and other noises, next to a busy road, clogged drains, no water comes out, I did not test if there was electricity, since As soon as I saw it, I decided not to spend the night there, I went to the Gimenells area"
85964,1803829,4,manny_la_belle_vie,02/04/2022,It is quiet. Service and free electricity. Many shops in town if needed. Thanks to the community
85964,1793940,2,CADE,24/03/2022,"Only gray electricity and emptying works. No water, black drain clogged. a pity"
85964,1777694,4,patco86,08/03/2022,We had a good quiet night. free electrical terminals in function but no water or possibility of emptying the toilets. Visit of the old town. Thanks to the municipality
85964,1769793,2,RobertBech,01/03/2022,"The drinking water load is damaged and the sewage drain is clogged. The light load works correctly and the gray water can be emptied. We didn't sleep there, we went to the side of the river, so we don't know how it is at night."
85964,1746970,4,RodantPelMon,03/02/2022,"service area without service, it seems to be freezing, otherwise correct."
85964,1746378,1,pinkvanlife,02/02/2022,It's only worth it for the light. When we arrived it smelled like excrement and there must be farms nearby. Also strange cars. I will not repeat.
85964,1744370,1,latortushopie,30/01/2022,place that at first glance seems dangerous. people in cars doing weird things and weird gangs. looks like the bronx
85964,1740743,4,margac,24/01/2022,Well placed area. No noise. Free electricity. No water due to risk of frost. A few cars that come to park nearby but don't stay overnight.
85964,1731028,4,PometaVan,09/01/2022,Good because we have been calm and the light is free. Luckily it was cold and the young people left early but the floor was very dirty with bottles and fast food. A shame because otherwise it would be very good
85964,1719180,1,Emilio1955,29/12/2021,"I did not like it at all, there were a lot of kids with loud music, cleaning the car with wet wipes and leaving them on the floor all in disgust. We left there"
85964,1716754,1,Gege54,27/12/2021,"area to be avoided in winter. the water closed so no cassette emptying, nor filling. frequented in the evening by groups of very noisy young people who leave all their rubbish on the spot."
85964,1715558,1,Amperioloco,25/12/2021,"The area is fine if it weren't because it is not known if it is a car area or a children's PK with the music blasting. It also opened to teach some ""motorhomes"" that if the clean water and the black drain is closed ..., you don't have to use them. The town is very beautiful to visit, it hurts the effort to have a car area for four children to come and invite us to leave."
85964,1706025,1,gerard4949,08/12/2021,Clean and black water out of order. You can only drop the gray ones.
85964,1702535,3,odilecnckrt,03/12/2021,"Water tap and toilet drain closed .. noisy at night, but hey there is electricity!"
85964,1699894,3,ianb,29/11/2021,Great for free leci but toilet emptying pipe is blocked and it's a little noisy in the early hours when lorries use the car park or park nearby and have an early start
85964,1695258,4,milito66,21/11/2021,good area all free but black pockets
85964,1689827,4,Txelleta,15/11/2021,"Well-conditioned area, electricity, water, drained water and free water Too bad the pot can't be emptied, it's clogged. We had a quiet day and will definitely be back. Thank you Balaguer"
85964,1688135,5,madeizan,13/11/2021,"We were on Friday night and very well. All quiet. Thanks to the Balaguer Town Hall for the area and services, including electricity. We had dinner in a local establishment for 10. We will be back."
85964,1685060,4,rolletNadine,11/11/2021,Very good all free service and nice city tour
85964,1665758,3,hneva,28/10/2021,"I stopped on the 27th around 3pm with the intention of staying until the next day, but as soon as I arrived, a car arrived at full speed skidding in order to send as much dust as possible the ground is in the ground, on the ground. camping car. I left immediately, I imagine the evening and the weekend. Too bad because all the services and well placed. Bad luck for me today."
85964,1641693,2,superfamilyonroad,12/10/2021,"Quiet place to spend the night. Flooded sewage drainage. The municipality itself is large and has history to visit, but the ""old"" area is run down, dirty, and smells of urine. A shame ..."
85964,1638317,3,bibine.44,11/10/2021,We had a great night here after visiting the city. thank you to the municipality for thinking of us. pity that the emptying of the cassette is not possible: it overflows and the worst thing is that it does not prevent some from continuing to empty their cassette. it's filthy and it's a shame for motorhome operators!
85964,1591052,5,Dani8080,19/09/2021,"Flat area with an area for emptying both waters and filling, part with wooded shade."
85964,1590915,4,tonilidia,19/09/2021,Good place to spend the night near the center ... very good for Balaguer
85964,1572002,3,frannetpat,12/09/2021,"Area close to the medieval town. All impeccable services. Young people were playing on the basketball court, but what could be more normal at the beginning of September. Quiet night."
85964,1568616,4,Dinamita,11/09/2021,"Good area with all services and free light points, it has shady trees, on weekends you can see young people who come to make a bottle with loud music and leave the place full of boats and make everything dirty. Thanks to the city council for the area"
85964,1564771,4,VANNIA,10/09/2021,"Very good facilities and services. We have spent two quiet nights. With electricity and water totally free. Congratulations to the Balaguer city council for thinking about the well-being of the van and AC. Young people doing youthful things with respect and in their city, where we are the outsiders."
85964,1547965,4,txu-txu,05/09/2021,We have spent the night during the week and very calm. Some car around 10:30 p.m. that they left early. It has everything and the best sewage drainage we have seen.
85964,1468513,1,Hanukaglez,16/08/2021,We came over for a night and checked that the negative comments are real. 8 in the afternoon and there were some kids in a car doing we don't know what. Two very run down old ACs that look like they are there in perpetuity. We did not feel safe and continued to the closest private area.
85964,1405262,3,salolimu,04/08/2021,"The area is very good, with light, water, toilet and a lot of shade. The bad thing is the people who do in the surroundings. The old town and the river are amazing, but be careful with the people of the old part, it's scary to get lost in the streets, a pity !!."
85964,1392533,2,alvasan75,01/08/2021,"Free services, gray and black, water load and electricity, which attracts the smart-ass. Some young people carrying their cell phones and an electric scooter occupied all the sockets so we could not use them. Several cars with music changing the oil and then pouring it into the drain of the cars. This place will not last long ... a shame"
85964,1357184,4,elenapurpura,24/07/2021,"We have slept here on different occasions and always very well, of course there are young people in the area, this is him. river next door and there is an urban gym... but people go home between 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. and don't bother them. Today, Friday, we once again spent a night without problems."
85964,1329868,3,AraceliIglesias,16/07/2021,"Free emptying and filling services, there are shadows. The town is beautiful but there is a bad atmosphere. We did not sleep in the area because it seemed very unsafe, we moved to the parking lot next to the river and the horrible night, cars came and went all the time, being a daily day. I do not recommend sleeping in Balaguer, better Cervera or Tarrega that are close"
85964,1295596,1,joac1976,04/07/2021,There's no water
85964,1268022,2,Tokoy13,21/06/2021,"Services ok, but there is a lot of noise at night from parties (and drug trafficking). Stop & Go."
85964,1250562,3,pisku,12/06/2021,Good place to visit Balaguer during the perfect day but at night the two times that we have been impossible to sleep with the noise of the young people with the bottle and the music at full blast we will return during the day but there is no sleep
85964,1226329,4,AndamosMochileando,30/05/2021,"Good for Balaguer for creating this area for this group and also all for free. However, we decided to change places because there was youth with loud music when we wanted to go to sleep. I don't blame them, but we preferred to sleep soundly!"
85964,1210935,5,mkarkoszka,22/05/2021,"Free amenities, large parking."
85964,1195309,5,thorretje,13/05/2021,"Extraordinary good place, on the edge of a medium-sized town, where there is something to do for everyone young or old, canoeing, terraces, restaurants, shops, bicycle shop, etc. etc. We will definitely be back."
85964,1192396,4,ACPedro,11/05/2021,"Thanks to l'Ajuntament. Parking very well located. All free services. It shares space with other equipment that, far from being a nuisance, provide accompaniment. For the detractors, to think that the foreigners are us. THANK YOU"
85964,1181719,4,lrpru29,29/04/2021,"Unwelcoming place although it is good for the facilities, all free. When I have arrived at noon, most of the places occupied by vehicles that have nothing to do with camping. Unfortunately I see little future for the free power outlet. There are vehicles of people with few resources that live inside."
85964,1175069,4,mercenegre,17/04/2021,"Great location and all services for free. Clean, correct and shaded spaces. It has no charm, despite being by the river. Good initiative city council."
85964,1170382,4,JordiF,08/04/2021,"Although the place at first seemed unpleasant, we had a very quiet night and we liked the village very much, the whole village is very well cared for and it is a pleasure to visit it."

85964,1169724,3,angelbcn,07/04/2021,"A practical place to drain water and park to visit Balaguer. We did not stay to sleep, as the environment was not very cozy and quite ugly and a lot of dust. We are grateful that Balaguer puts these services at our disposal. As a negative point from a health point of view, right next to the area is a sports court. As there is no fountain, the users of the sports court will cool off and maybe drink water in the device where the sewage is emptied. The clean water tap is on the opposite side of the sports court, so they use the first tap they see and that is what the motorhomes use to clean the toilet."
85964,1164423,3,vacancesauto,02/04/2021,"Area very well located, public, the plugs are used by people to charge mobile phones, young people with music devices that work with a lot of volume, I don't know what will happen when confinement ends !!!! However congratulations to the city council for the initiative."
85964,1163942,5,berlingueros1990,02/04/2021,Quiet area with easy access
85964,1162005,3,joanjo,31/03/2021,"The area is close to the center, the squares are quite wide and have free electricity connection. The service area can be improved and needs maintenance. Because it’s in a parking lot and next to a sports field, there’s a lot of noise throughout the afternoon. As there is a curfew, we were able to sleep peacefully, but seeing the atmosphere I do not know under normal circumstances if there will be tranquility."
85964,1160979,5,Killpaff,30/03/2021,"Good place to visit Balaguer, Free services and very well located. The sports area in the afternoons busy but without problems. quiet night (will it be confinement?)"
85964,1158563,5,Wildfox001,27/03/2021,A good place to stop and visit Balaguer. We must thank the city council for this initiative.

85964,1127720,3,turistacielito,03/01/2021,Free drainage of gray and black water. I don't think it is a good place to spend the night since it is an area where there are little characters making a bottle.
85964,1120497,4,martacabing,10/12/2020,Good place to take a break.
85964,1095100,5,Sandunguero,16/10/2020,Very grateful to the Balaguer City Council for putting this area of AC with all the free services. Balaguer himself is worth discovering. Greetings from a Tramp on Wheels.
85964,1093511,3,VictorJurado,14/10/2020,"The site is fine. The services work perfectly, unlimited free light, water and gray and black downloads. It is a park and during the day there are young people playing soccer on the soccer field, etc ... no problem with that. The problem comes at night, since it is the place where the fools of the town gather to race, skid, bottle and scream."
85964,1093263,3,Xikitines,14/10/2020,"Free area with all services, a very good initiative to the Balaguer town hall! The bad thing is that it fills with children and not so children doing spinning tops, loud music and yelling at all hours. Noon, afternoon or night. I recommend going to the parking lot right in front of the river. Very calm. Nothing to see!"
85964,1089779,5,chiro,11/10/2020,"motorhome area totally free, shade, water, electricity, discharges of black and gray water, there is some culjmpio and a football court, the pity that it does not have a high fence so that the ball does not come out, otherwise no suggestion Thank you town hall and town of Balaguer."
85964,1087019,4,xabs,09/10/2020,"We have stopped to eat and change water and we have taken the opportunity to buy some things in town. Attached there is a sports court that gives a lot of play for the little ones. Reading the comments we will not risk spending the night because it is Friday. In fact, while being here, 3 cars have been there that have been with loud music for a while and accelerating the car proud of the noise it made."
85964,1042899,4,CalViudo,12/09/2020,"We were there on 08/29/2020. The area is very good, with free electricity and all services but as mentioned in some previous comments, there are cars that are dedicated to making circuits between the trees in the area or to occupy the unloading area to fill bottles and feel music. We didn’t stay to sleep because of it."
85964,1023191,5,Expatriespagne,03/09/2020,"Large car park with games near the sports hall, with 10 flat pitches equipped with electrical terminals. also an area for emptying gray and black water as well as drinking water. GRACIAS AL AYUNTAMIENTO DE BALAGUER. Everything is free !"
85964,1023188,1,sack7,03/09/2020,We were on Friday August 14 and very bad. Cars kept going in and out with the Alta music. We picked up and went to the Artesa de Segre area where we were very good.
85964,1022105,2,topomarina2,03/09/2020,Perfect area. The only problem is the young people who meet even during the week.
85964,1006467,2,Hoppers,27/08/2020,"We stayed on a Wednesday night, lots of kids drinking, quite intimidating but they were not interested in us at all. The area smells disgusting, like the river runs full of sewage perhaps. The facilities are excellent however and free. We slept well with ear plugs in."
85964,989990,1,juandedios,22/08/2020,We could not stop to sleep due to the large influx of young people making bottles. Although there was a camper and 4 motorhomes
85964,989428,5,amaiabarns,21/08/2020,"Thanks to the city council for supporting another type of tourism. Quiet night. There were young people but to their roll and no problem. Spacious, shade, water, gray water and electricity. Park next door."
85964,975650,1,judith04,18/08/2020,"It was completely empty. It gave a very bad feeling. Young people making a bottle. It was a Monday. Finally we did not spend the night in the parking lot. Edito: 100 meters before arriving there are parking spaces parallel to the river. There were 4 camper vans and we were able to sleep without problems. There is no traffic or noise, eat the river next door."

85964,780652,2,turrimtb,15/02/2020,"Hi. 10 area if it were not because on weekends they make a bottle and put the music of the cars to the fullest. At 11 I went elsewhere. A pity, the local police should take action. There is no motorhome left"

85964,772548,3,Albert_Challenger,26/01/2020,"The area is very good, but maybe because it was Saturday there was a lot of young people with music from the cars very loud, in the hall there were also some acts and a lot of noise. We had to leave to sleep."
85964,772355,5,jtorra,25/01/2020,"Great! Thanks to Balaguer town hall! Load of water, discharge of grays, electricity ... all for free! Playground, football field and basketball ... Next to the center!"

It also has for emptying gray and black water. We spent a super quiet night and NO noise. BRAVO CITY COUNCIL OF BALAGUER !!!!"
85964,762353,5,brufi,02/01/2020,"From November 7 to 10 they are local parties, possibly that's why there was noise at night. 100 × 100 rest of the year recommended"
85964,760113,5,marti_s9,30/12/2019,"We have spent a night, incidentally. Free area (which is appreciated). The electricity worked and we have been very calm. Recommendable."
85964,740746,2,Meri87,09/11/2019,"Great place but read I put two stars because we were unable to sleep. We had to call the police repeatedly as there were cars spinning, butt music, drunkards ... We couldn't sleep until after three in the morning. The police were only one of the times they were called but the boys continued to bottle."
85964,739710,2,cazstodd,07/11/2019,Great site from municipal but after 2 hours of listening to a a boom box from a car we gave up and left
85964,736670,5,SunRoller,02/11/2019,"We were there on Saturday night, October 12, and everything worked perfectly in the area. There are four power sockets of 16 amps each. It is also one of the few that I have seen that it has a tap to clean the toilet, and another to fill clean water. Super quiet night. For my part a 10 for this initiative of the Ayto. Totally free."
85964,698768,4,Cio,21/09/2019,"I have not yet tested the loading / unloading of waters but the area is very good. tall trees that do not bother with the branches but give shade, there are light connectors that do work, today there is activity in the pavilion, maybe that's why. By the way .... all services for free. I take a star, the water does not work, I have seen the key but it is stuck ... same with tool."
85964,693655,2,Maryvilla,16/09/2019,"To sleep the area is fine, but the water does not work and neither does the electricity."
85964,665559,3,Annealgerri,28/08/2019,I just went to empty and clean toilet and the water doesn't work. In case you plan to stop.
85964,662911,5,Guilless,27/08/2019,"Quiet drain, gray and black water. Electricity, everything free. No water at the tap. All ready of the river. If the site seems a little abandoned we are still there. Thank you to the municipality."
85964,632929,4,Corcho,16/08/2019,"Ground parking next to the sports hall and the river. Free emptying, filling and electricity. There is a football pitch to one side where at night some young people gather but they do not bother. Very quiet night Perfect place to spend the night on the road. Be respectful to continue letting us use this place. A 10 for the town hall."
85964,598993,2,sodeuxde,04/08/2019,"You feel a little lonely in the neighborhood, you do not feel safe. we leave...."
85964,590289,4,SVL02,01/08/2019,Real free service area including electricity. You will find trash bins in front of the sports center along the road. Some football players who stop early enough land not being enlightened. Some young people gathered but in silence.
85964,515429,4,pit,14/06/2019,"Very good, near center and river. Only downside: basketball court = balloon noises in the evening. Service area = Ok but not tested except water faucet."
85973,2223286,1,Quentai13,12/08/2022,"Very nice place, but forbidden to stay there overnight. Were woken up by the police."
85973,1975736,4,brunopath,14/06/2022,"location feet in the water, even if a little dirty unfortunately"
85973,1873866,5,kudson,06/05/2022,"We loved this spot, some noise from the road but it’s not too busy. We weren’t bothered for 3 days - one of our favourite spots! Gorgeous view of the lake"
85973,1834676,4,mamabea37,18/04/2022,Beautiful area. Calm. Road above not bothersome at night. Be careful when exiting on the main road.
85973,1363766,5,CedM64,25/07/2021,"Very good very pleasant, but you have to learn what uses the places to do their need while thinking of the next user, it's still a shame to soil such beautiful corners with toilet paper that ends up in a garland on the trees. It is necessary to bury after having made its needs and to put the paper in the trash and not in nature Thank you."
85973,1176322,1,canjulhappy,19/04/2021,There is A LOT of trash in the surrounding brush and old abandoned clothing lying around here and there. You can also hear traffic noise from the road nearby. I don’t recommend.
85973,1087956,5,Remilucho,10/10/2020,"Very nice and very quiet. Perfect for sleeping, eating, ..."
85973,872005,5,mossj,15/07/2020,"Incredible spot, there’s room for 1 van under a tree which always has shade, with flat ground and a small beach into the lake. I was here for two nights completely alone, only 1 person came to get some water. I went swimming every day, the water is perfect, doesn’t smell weird or anything! Make sure you leave any food you don’t want in the bushes before the beach, a little family of mice love the avocado I left out!"
85985,2796226,4,TomaGH,28/05/2023,"Very convenient, free parking and a short walk to the beach and downtown."
85985,726202,4,Samsi,20/10/2019,"Beautiful view, near the beach and hot showers (only € 1.10). Of course, not recommended on weekends or during holidays because young people come to suck and make noise with speakers. and it is very narrow only for cars or small trucks (Berlingo without problems), quite pending."
85985,658807,5,nicocaillot,25/08/2019,"Thank you very much, just 20 minutes walk from the center"
85985,649430,2,Krolins,21/08/2019,"In this location difficult to park. The street is very narrow. On the other hand, in the street of ascent to this location perpendicular to the promenade of the Duke of Baena you can park before the containers, but it is not a comfortable area. We park to visit the city, the area is quiet we could have spent the night. That if I walk with a little slope."
85985,395028,1,PeggySaurus,17/10/2018,Too tight to get down this road for the free parking. We turned around and parked on the main road further up the street. The parking shown on the picture with the green fence is paid parking & partly owned by hotel. Bigger vans and motorhomes look elsewhere.
85985,380801,5,lesick,23/09/2018,Near the beach and showers
85985,294707,4,RyanBotting,20/07/2018,"Unbelievably beautiful spot overlooking San Seb beach. Free parking up the hill but is usually busy, paid parking as you head towards the beach which is reasonable. Showers, toilets and Spar supermarket 5min walk towards the beach. Get amongst."
85985,293623,5,jonomaguire,19/07/2018,Amazing spot
86051,288040,4,alvaro1989,13/07/2018,Also it passes the route of street that did in bicycle by the mountain palentina
86075,3281035,4,Belen1314,10/09/2023,"Good place to spend the night, we arrived at 8:00 p.m. and there were only motorhomes left. Access 10 minutes walk to the beach. There is a beach bar that was very good for us in the morning, a little expensive, but it has fresh drinks, you can use the toilet and an outdoor shower that works with coins for €1/min."
86075,3154484,5,EnekoZabalza,15/08/2023,"We arrived at 20:00 and there were already few vehicles. If you have doubts about how to park, I recommend doing it in battery against the gates (otherwise they might wake you up in the morning to make you move the vehicle). The road is narrow but buses pass regularly, so it is possible to do it (you will almost certainly have to maneuver due to the amount of traffic). there was hardly anyone in the parkin"
86075,3127270,5,MonikMap,12/08/2023,"We arrived at 10:00 p.m. and parked a 7m motorhome without a problem. In the morning at 8 it began to fill up and at 9 it was complete. We spent the night without problem. The access is narrow for large vehicles, so it is recommended to arrive late, after 10 pm, when the cars have already left."
86075,3123129,5,DavidMolina,11/08/2023,"The controllers call you out if you leave space with another van or AC because they want to fit as many cars as possible, but when it happened to us it was already 10 in the morning and it was completely full, so we couldn't do much... Otherwise a quiet night. There are toilets in the bar and cold shower for €1/minute. There are no other services, nor containers."
86075,3091660,5,martona45,07/08/2023,"Quiet place at night. Bring mosquito repellent. 10 min from the cove in Turqueta. Very pretty, although I was quite disappointed. A lot of plastic in the water and out and you see a lot of micro plastic while snorkeling. And there are watermelon and pinya shells (a boy comes with some wheelbarrows selling fruit and drinks), and people leave it lying around, having garbage cans at the entrance to the cove."
86075,3065796,5,meldavecamper,02/08/2023,"Super parking lot to visit the beaches in the area. Overnight stays are fine too. It's best to come before 7 a.m. as it fills up after 7 a.m. Or come after 8 p.m., that's when it empties. If you park impertinently, you will be woken up in the morning by the attendant and sent away because he will direct the cars."
86075,3045794,5,ManuLara,30/07/2023,We arrived at night and parked under a tree where it was not disturbed so that the next day they would not move us. Starting at 8 it starts to fill up. Let's take care and respect these places so that they continue to let us spend the night.
86075,3036213,4,carranzalex,28/07/2023,Then the perfect section to sleep if the next day you want to go to the cove without getting up early because at 7 in the morning the parking lot is full. The only bad thing are the mosquitoes and the dust as it is a dirt parking lot.
86075,2949518,5,sanesu,11/07/2023,"The site is very good, it is better to go as late as possible by car or van, so access is easy and parking is better. If the beach bar is open, ask Mr. where he usually parks and he will tell you. This way you make sure that no one wakes you up. It seems that the cicadas are not going to let you sleep... at night they are silent... hehehe... services as it says. Shower €1 the bathroom is closed at night"
86075,2946063,5,martadzerio,10/07/2023,"The place is ideal to go to the turqueta cove the next day. Be careful where you park at night, find a place where you won't be disturbed, in the morning there are two people in charge of organizing the cars in the parking lot and sometimes they have to wake up the motorhomes and tell them to change places, I have seen how many of them They confronted the organizers. We are lucky enough to sleep there."
86075,2920527,5,abgarciam,03/07/2023,Better to arrive late in the afternoon. There is a beach bar with a paid shower service and toilets that are only open when they are open. The cove is a 15-minute walk away. Yesterday there was quite a bit of algae on the shore. There is no mobile coverage.
86075,2907272,5,djoull,30/06/2023,perfect for spending the night it is super quiet. the parking lot fills up very quickly and very early in the morning. inaccessible during the day.
86075,2863591,5,Lito87,17/06/2023,Perfect parking to spend the night. We arrived with everything empty but it fills up first thing in the morning to go to the cove. Park in the upper part since we parked below and they woke us up to change places and optimize the space for all vehicles. But 0 problems because we slept there. There is a small kiosk to buy sandwiches and a toilet.
86075,2668594,5,ArkaitzArmen,14/04/2023,"good to spend the night, quiet place. beach 10 min walk. bathrooms open only for bar consumers"

86075,2408988,4,Maldivas,28/09/2022,"Very quiet night, without services, arriving at the last minute to be able to park, beach bar with paid shower."
86075,2330595,5,silvaT3,02/09/2022,"We arrived at night, the best way to get there is to have a good spot. It has bar and toilet service. Mr. who controls the entrances was always super friendly. There is a short walk to the beach which makes up for the magnificent beach."
86075,2293271,5,chris31130,24/08/2022,"Perfect parking for the night, essential to get there the day before to go to Cala de Turquita the next day!! Small car park, so full from 7h/7h30 in the morning!! Shower possible at the snack bar: €1 per minute, but great because few beaches offer it! Access to the beach: take the main path straight, 15 min on foot, accessible by stroller (do not take the blue or red path)."
86075,2196877,4,carlesTM,08/08/2022,"You have to arrive at night, it's already full in the early hours. Lots of cars, it's on the ground, there's a snack bar with a shower for €1 and ice for €3. Its beach is fantastic, also with a lot of people in summer, you can go there by bike."
86075,2191181,3,fk30,07/08/2022,"Very dusty parking lot. No service at night. The garbage cans are at the entrance to the beach, 10-15 minutes on foot. We came here because the parking lot at Macarella is accessible only by buses at this time. At 7am many cars arrive."
86075,2000354,5,txintxuvanzuri,22/06/2022,"We spent the night alone very calmly, perfect for getting up early and being the first to arrive at Cala Turqueta, but at 7:30 in the morning the cars began to arrive."
86075,1979731,4,MickaelScherer,15/06/2022,"Large parking lot, but very crowded. It is better to go there around 7 p.m. in the evening or 8 a.m. in the morning. Toilets are available for 50cent or a drink at the bar. And the showers at 1€, on the other hand you have to shower very quickly. The shower lasts less than a minute, hurry up! Quiet at night, ideal for spending the night"
86075,1936617,5,Magixkarp,01/06/2022,"As the other comments say, it is better to arrive at night, in the morning it is impossible. Noiseless night and during the day a bar where there are showers for after the beach."
86075,1594181,4,Darioalbert6,20/09/2021,"If you want to go to Cala En Turqueta, the best plan is to go to sleep in the parking lot. We arrived at night, there were three other ACs and vans. At 8 in the morning the parking lot was already full of cars."
86075,1540405,3,jayfarrix,02/09/2021,"We spent the night there with other ACs and campers. Very quiet night but I give it a 3 because the dust makes the vehicle very dirty and also because at 8 in the morning when we woke up, the parking lot was already full, 0 privacy"
86075,1530336,3,Brucete,30/08/2021,"You have to go very late or very early, depending on what time you go it is closed, a lot of dust, sleep without problems, some were attracted to camping,"
86075,1413608,5,lusazor,06/08/2021,We came in the middle of August and spent the night in peace with several ACs and campers in the parking lot. At 6.30 in the morning cars began to come to the beach and at 7.30 the parking lot was already full.
86075,1197187,5,lesmininousauboutdumonde,14/05/2021,"We were in May so a quiet night and ... alone! We were able to enjoy Cala Turqueta until the end of the afternoon and suddenly almost alone once again! From Cala Turqueta, departure for Cala Macarelleta and Macarella by the Cami de Cavalls. Magic !!"

86098,2283861,4,Longhinos,22/08/2022,"Very quiet to sleep among pines. The fountain has a trick, because it seems to be broken, but you have to activate the key that is in the chest to the right of the fountain. Controlled camping area so you are likely to see people in tents. no noise or light pollution, perfect for seeing a beautiful starry sky. Garbage cans and concrete tables."

86098,642869,3,riftercoco,19/08/2019,"Very quiet place to spend the night. There are two zones with independent accesses, separated about 50m. The closest to Covarrubias is more discreet. In the middle of August we expected to find some movement, however we slept alone. There is a fountain, barbecues, tables and containers. It is generally quite dirty, with papers and trash on the floor. The road is very close."

86359,574045,4,Banditcd,24/07/2019,We've spent a night after enjoying the river and it's great. It is advisable to park in front of the kabaña because the Txiringuito car park is very small and a 7 m ac is going to look bad to maneuver.
86368,2525963,3,bakasana,21/12/2022,"The road only works in dry weather and is borderline in one or two places. There wasn't that much rubbish, I collected everything in one heap (under the broken rubber dinghy). We only spent the afternoon here.

There is a lot of rubbish left by fisherman - we filled two bin bags to take away but there was still loads left. Please take your rubbish with you and try to take a little more if you can!
86368,625193,3,mpiwons,13/08/2019,The place faces beautiful artificial lake which is great to have short refreshing swim. But it is uneven and it is hard to level the car. During the summer also lots of rubbish and probably as a consequence - lots of wasps. Beautiful place spoiled by people.

If you go down to the parking lot below, during the day you have to pay, but at 7:00 p.m. or so the man leaves and you can go in and out without anyone watching. We spent the night here, there was no one and it was very quiet. At 9 o'clock or so, cars began to come to visit the hermitage. The only sign that appears is no motorhomes."
86432,3058578,3,MaxCiarrocca,01/08/2023,Went here this morning and only found a spot because another motorhomer left his for us. Many campers have had to leave. The real problem is that to visit the site you need to book and when we tried to do it everything was already busy! So if you go to get to the islet remember to book.
86432,3017992,4,isramu88,25/07/2023,"The parking lot is tiny but 4/5 campers can fit in level spaces. The night has been quiet except for 3 envious people who passed whistling down the road at dawn. We slept with four other ACs and didn't have any problems. I don't think they put an impediment to sleeping in the parking lots below, but it was quite lonely and we decided to go up to this one."

However, you should NOT follow the GPS coordinates (they send you a very small, very narrow, very steep path up the mountain on the side facing away from the sea.

86432,2925544,4,onlylocals,05/07/2023,Good parking to visit San Juan de Gaztelugatxe the next day. During the day many cars are unaware that there is a free parking lot below. I recommend that you park in reverse if you arrive at night so that you can leave comfortably the next day as it fills up with cars and maneuvering is complicated.

86432,1798584,5,CharlotandCo,28/03/2022,Really nice free spot considering it’s quite difficult to find a free parking around. Lovely view from the top of the hill and quite night.
86432,1795001,4,Teok,25/03/2022,"Few places, mostly occupied by cars that could go to the park further down, given the prohibition of access for campers. Stop for a couple of hours giving a tour of the magical place."
86432,1724400,4,TimoBrockmann,03/01/2022,"We spent one night here and liked it. But: It’s true that there are only few spaces here and most of them are taken by cars. It’s a hot mess around sunset, but with a bit of patience you can get one. Only 1-2 spots are level. If you face the sea, the view is beautiful and you don’t hear the road. Quite windy. Walk past the restaurant uphill for an easy and nice view!"
86432,1722199,2,AgnesdeB,01/01/2022,"Ordinary parking along the road. Very uncomfortable, we drove on. And the church can't be reached for the time being because of the danger of the bridge collapsing."
86432,1696357,5,giiselasolis4,23/11/2021,"We parked the AC here to go see San Juan de Gaztelugatxe (currently closed due to risk of detachment). The parking is good but the cars park here instead of below that they have their own parking and leave few places for us, taking into account that they do not allow us to park further down."
86432,1688691,4,JoseAntonioForraje,14/11/2021,"We arrived around 6pm and we found room for AC. We spent the night there to visit Gaztelugatxe early in the morning and great. Bathrooms down the road a bit, clean and with paper."
86432,1678763,1,KePaXeta,05/11/2021,"It is the only parking lot where motorhomes can be parked ... small, uneven and narrow. Cars park upstairs when they can park lower down. A pity that in such a beautiful place they don't want us"
86432,1676306,3,ster888,03/11/2021,"A little inclined, near the road, further down there is another parking lot a little quieter, we slept with a couple more vans"
86432,1663172,3,isabellaoh,26/10/2021,Very small and crowded parking lot. Access to San Juan is currently closed so no reason to park here except for the toilets which are open. (Possible to still take a walk which has a view of San Juan)
86432,1662902,4,thibetrem,26/10/2021,Very quiet parking lot arrived in the evening around 10:30 p.m. few people at this time of year. Very practical for going for a walk the next day. Indeed the places are sloping apart from the power stations. Difficult to find a place after 10am. Do not park in the parking lot below because the police run very regularly.
86432,1637971,5,sorinp,10/10/2021,"Very beautiful place with a splendid sunset. We slept very well, no noises. 2 camper and one campervan and after 9pm stopped other two camper and vans. In a middle of a day is difficult to find a place. Only if you are lucky. Acces to San Juan are closed. You can go down 200m. And make a picture. Restaurants are opened."
86432,1633129,3,viajererosenfamilia,08/10/2021,"Very few places and with a lot of unevenness. I do not recommend it to spend the night although we did it and we were fine, but there are a lot of noises and as I have said before, a lot of unevenness"
86432,1628368,3,pbaenag,05/10/2021,"Few places for AC. We spent the night on October 2 (Saturday night). We arrived at 9:00 p.m. and found 1 free spot for a 7.5 m AC, somewhat uneven. There were another 4 AC. During the day it gets crowded with cars."
86432,1621973,2,monixado,02/10/2021,"Ac is only allowed in the upper parking lot, the first entering on the left. It is the smallest and with unevenness."
86432,1594739,4,tevenac,20/09/2021,"In this period, the attendance is average. We went down to the lower parking lot with our van. There were others. The descent and ascent to the Gaztelugatxe site is steep, wear good shoes. There is a longer access (2.4k) but less steep by taking the track which passes in front of the Gastelu-Begi restaurant. In addition, no checkpoint by this route."
86432,1575613,4,Beeca,13/09/2021,Quiet place to sleep. It has a bit of unevenness depending on the square. Has toilets nearby. In the morning he gets involved with the visitors to Gaztelugatxe quite a bit.
86432,1565041,4,pauliky8,10/09/2021,"If you arrive late (when the visits end) at least in September there was enough room, we arrived at sunset with a GV but several more arrived during the night. It has views and is a bit uneven, depending on the square but not exaggerated either. The bathrooms below do not close and are clean. Recommended if you are going to do Gaztelugatxe at the last minute or first in the morning without reservation"
86432,1564318,2,mitodes,10/09/2021,"It's so small, patchy, and crowded (not CC specific) that it can't even be considered valid parking. The rest, an esplanade on a lower level, prohibited for motorhomes. Still, if you are lucky enough to find a place, the place is worth it."
86432,1563628,3,Flachbomber,09/09/2021,"The parking lot is good for one night. However, you can no longer get to the beach in front of the tourists, a gate was built. We kept to the left of the restaurant."
86432,1503596,4,elpiojo95,23/08/2021,"During the very crowded day, it is difficult to maneuver with the motorhome since there are slopes and people leave the car lying around in any way. The site is awesome!"

86432,1425681,4,perpaal96,08/08/2021,"Perfect place to spend the night, we arrive around 23:00, a lot of space to park, and be able to get up at 7:00 and start walking. in this way we saved the reservation, and made the route before the guards passed. the tourist route starts at 10 am against: crowded parking during the day."
86432,1415699,2,alvanee,06/08/2021,"Parking difficult for motorhomes but not impossible and despite being always full, if you wait a while someone always leaves and you can park to visit the hermitage or do the route, that is, reserving the visit beforehand."

86432,1334942,1,boomcarvana,18/07/2021,"It is overcrowded and difficult to park, although there is parking below the entrance of motorhomes, no overnight stays are forbidden. If you are lucky enough to find a place to just park, it would be too steep for one night."
86432,1334888,4,samenwonen2009,18/07/2021,"Small Car Park at the entrance of the park, quiet night,but arrive late 10 pm to get a spot, early getup to visit the park before reservations start."
86432,1307224,5,CanKerberus,09/07/2021,"Small car park where you can visit the hermitage, next to the road that is impressive."
86432,1291995,4,oscarsanse83,02/07/2021,"Parkin for Ac, 5-6 as Max. Stuck on the road. Ideal if you visit the hermitage the next day."

86432,1013077,3,Anabotella,29/08/2020,"Very crowded during the day, at night it is good if you want to do the Gaztelugatxe route, a sloping site requires chocks and we with a 7.5m motorhome only one place. At night there is no one!"
86432,994875,3,LaraVSantorum,23/08/2020,"Very crowded during the day, many places for the night. It is still a parking lot, but it has bathrooms open all night. There are no views. It's quiet. Very strategic to visit San Juan de Gazteluaxe. In the morning with the arrival of the visitors there is no privacy."
86432,990286,1,baloo75,22/08/2020,"Very small parking, at 10 am we have no longer found a place and from here AC circulation is not allowed so we have had to park in the viewpoint of the road that goes to Bermeo ..."

Quiet at night. Not very large squares but it is parked well. On a very busy day, many vehicles stop here because access to the car parks below is very poorly signposted. Lack of motorhome services."

It has a couple of restaurants right next to where you can have dinner and lunch, at breakfast time they are not open. There are bathrooms."
86432,631845,5,Jska,15/08/2019,Ideal site with good views. During the day it costs a lot to find parking but at night it empties cars and fills up with motor homes. Very good atmosphere and very quiet to spend the night. At 9 in the morning a van comes and sells sweet pastries for breakfast. Great site!
86432,599426,1,morrot3,04/08/2019,Forbidden AC!
86432,497726,4,af31,31/05/2019,We were fortunate to be able to park with our 7 meter motorhome which was a little out of the way. Not seen prohibition sign for our vehicle. We enjoyed the ride to DragonStone.

A bit of passing traffic during the night and a few wild boars grunting away but apart from that a peaceful night. Great place to stay to get you ahead of the crowds for the hike to the island. Ppl started arriving in car park around 0800."

86432,413079,5,itxiar,09/12/2018,"Super recommended to see The hermitage of Gaztelugatxe! Ideal to sleep to be able to go down to the hermitage before 10 (from 10 you have to make a reservation in high season); In addition, before 10 you guarantee photos without people! Starting at 11 am almost impossible to park. We slept very quiet along with other 5 AC / van; Only the wind bothered us. Beautiful views upon awakening. In the car parks below it is forbidden ACs / Furgos, so it's better to risk it."
86432,404875,4,Cialu2017,05/11/2018,Small parking but with incredible views. Ideal to go down to visit the church in the morning and avoid waiting queues.

86432,292927,3,fbgomez,18/07/2018,"Although with few seats and with a certain inclination, it has been a great place to spend the night and to make the church early in the morning. It is advisable to leave the van or ac prepared to leave, as there is little space in each parking lot and tomorrow the parking lot is crowded. There are three toilets in the same parking lot."
86440,3255845,1,KSNK,04/09/2023,Full to the brim with cars. I think that residents park there (and rightly so). Nothing for motorhomes or vans. It's not pretty either.

There are a few spots where you can camp. See comment below about the no camping signs and respect this and respect nature. Enjoy!
86492,1678365,1,EllieC,05/11/2021,"We decided not stay as there were many signs saying camping and motorhomes were prohibited. Shame as it’s beautiful and right next to the climbing  (there did seem to be a number of vans staying at the lower car park , unsure if they had any trouble, but we moved on due to signage)."
86492,1650578,4,camperMissy,18/10/2021,Spent two nights. Very quiet. No services. Used by climbers at weekend. Nice people.
86492,787738,4,sterre,27/02/2020,There are many different parking spots alongside the road up. More people are camping out here in vans. Some places are private property and not allowed to camp there. But plenty of good spots.
86492,749217,4,Cccccccc,02/12/2019,Very peaceful and beautiful. Ideal climb parking. Most cars in the day are here for climbing or hiking. Some signs for camping prohibited in some spots but not others. a ranger passed by 3 times in a week (afternoons only) to check for signs of camping. Definitely fine for a night or two but may have trouble if you want to stay and climb long term.
86492,469393,1,Zdeno,27/04/2019,We did better not stay here overnight because of the signs on the trees all over - see pictures.
86492,435452,4,Bobstones,02/03/2019,"Lovely spot nice and quiet and right by the climbing. Super running & biking round here too. Only bad bit is there isn’t any sun so no solar charge throughout the day. There’s a water font in the town square Plaça Major, don’t think you can get vans up there but we filled up loads of bottles."
86492,420307,3,anajda,05/01/2019,"Nice place, very shady. However had the feeling that the night is not so gladly seen. But were not addressed. Have the departure then a sign discovered that indicates private grounds."
86492,418784,5,kar_li_tis,01/01/2019,"Ideal for night and start the day climbing. The AC should park down, where the dirt track begins, because in the morning you can come seprona and get out of the parking above, in addition, the road has some ""complicated"" section. Beware that when in the shade the solar panel does not charge, so keep an eye on the battery that fits!"

86492,349076,5,olguigordillo,22/08/2018,"We put 5 stars because although it does not have bathrooms, or fountains, ... you are surrounded by nature, surrounded by mountains, ridges, magnificent pine forests, very quiet and great place to disconnect.

86500,3186156,5,Woodhiker,20/08/2023,"What a lovely spot this was. After the people left to watch the sunset, I stood alone. The tranquility was overwhelming. Around 03:00 am I woke up to take a pee and the surprise was that all the lights were turned off. What a beauty. With the icing on the cake… a shooting star."
86500,3162693,2,oceeme,16/08/2023,"Very little shaded space and quite a lot of dirt. The only positive thing is that the water seems clean to take a bath, but the place does not invite you to spend the night."

Behind the parking lot (not huge) there are very tall trees that give a little coolness. Perfect for the hammock! It's very comfortable with dogs. He takes a bath !!!"

86526,3002603,5,isachuuu,22/07/2023,"We spent a couple of quiet nights, we left the van there for another night alone and without problem. The place inspires confidence as there is plenty of light and apartments nearby. pretty level"

86530,2522878,3,CarolineLucasG,16/12/2022,"Quiet place but close to the village with friendly locals (a little reassuring after the adventures of the spot tested previously...), waking up with the birds in the ruins and the cliffs. On the other hand, actually dirty... Be careful where you put your feet... Nice view of the city and the Cathedral when you wake up!"
86530,2513246,1,raul1996,05/12/2022,"night of 12/4/22 being Sunday, there are many cars at dawn with loud music, it seems that they use this place for sexual encounters. the place is full of garbage too"
86530,2228525,4,AxelGely,13/08/2022,Ok for one night. Very practical when looking to sleep and be a little isolated after visiting Zaragoza. Passage of a few cars and pedestrians without it being disturbing.
86530,2002369,5,alexakr,23/06/2022,"Good for spending the evening. Route through the very steep village, not suitable for a motorhome. Maximum combiVan size. Quiet place, trash available. On the edge of the village, without passing on the road"

86530,726717,5,dydreamr,21/10/2019,"A site pass if you like photography. Right next to it is a path and occasionally someone passes, although not often enough to be annoying. It seems a rather isolated place but when I was there we joined up to 4 vans. Mine is a kangoo, but the others were huge and there was no problem of space, in fact we were not even close (we went for pillars)."
86530,376798,3,RidingMyOwnWay,18/09/2018,EYE!! Beautiful place to spend a night! But a city worker recommended us to abandon it due to STONE DISSEMINATION
86530,343585,1,mikdzi,19/08/2018,"The place had to be nice, quiet a little wind, nice spot unfortunately it had to serve as a discharge since. There is rubbish of all kinds, a piece of glass and a cat that looks like home."

Second, 2 hours after my arrival (6:30 p.m.), 2 young people in cars parked in front of my van (surely no places elsewhere!!!) to listen to the music. Thanks. Goodbye but I'm not staying"
86546,2540927,4,KonDeer,04/01/2023,Quiet parking. There is no network / internet connection.
86546,1777318,4,SaskiaFranz,08/03/2022,large parking lot with tables and benches to sit. Many beautiful hiking trails from here. Many cyclists and hikers pass by in the morning. Parking lot with camera very quiet felt very safe.
86546,1709233,4,willowpillow,13/12/2021,"Very large parking lot, a lot of people in the morning because of hikes and small places to rest in nature nearby. Several tables to eat nearby. There are all amenities within 10 minutes by car."
86546,1302795,4,lorenpe2,07/07/2021,"Good place - I traveled on foot only with a tent and there was no problem with sleeping. RVs gathered for dinner, and around midnight he had a couple on a date, but they weren't extra noisy. I would go again."
86546,1212169,3,Francis2408,23/05/2021,"We stood here on Saturday night, beautiful hiking trails start right here, landscape all around also pure nature and a dream. A lot of traffic by hikers during the day, unfortunately at 3 o'clock at night a car came and turned donuts onto the square for 10 minutes. We were afraid that he would hit our car. Then they were gone again and it was quiet. Therefore perhaps better suited for overnight stays during the week. Easy access, road is wide enough for oncoming traffic and tarred. Internet reception tested by various providers and as good as nonexistent."
86546,1136920,3,xondi,13/02/2021,"I arrived at night and it took me five minutes to leave. I live in my van and I need internet to work. Here 0 coverage of movistar and vodafone. If you need to be connected, forget about this place. I can only assess it in this regard."
86546,1129988,3,fister,11/01/2021,Avoid in the weekend. We arrived Sunday 18:00 to a large group of youngsters smoking weed and hearing very loud Arabic hip hop. Fortunately they left around 19:00. Looks like there is 24h video surveillance. Dogs sometimes barking in the night in the area. Two roads in are both a bit narrow with large motorhome. But the walks and ruins are very scenic.
86546,707270,5,ericucho,28/09/2019,Very good place to spend the day / night.
86546,443508,4,Sauredrops,23/03/2019,"We were there for 2 nights. Visitors to the park come during the day during the week. Very quiet at night.

86635,732711,4,lmrequile,28/10/2019,"Thank you for this nice place. Easy access in 2 wheel drive van. For us it is a location ""nature"". Well take the track that runs along the field of ""corn"" (harvest made on this date). One location"
86642,3203995,5,MurphyT2,23/08/2023,"An incredible view, in a tent and on an isolated pitch. Quiet and simple, the managers are very nice, 24€ per night for 2 people without electricity. The view is well worth it, I recommend the free camping pitches which are far from the other pitches, with a view of the sea and without noise. The sanitary facilities are clean, there is no waiting. A 6/5 for me."
86642,3101887,5,Mattimarco,08/08/2023,"The campsite is very nice, basic but with all the services including a small restaurant, minimarket, swimming pool and even a small sauna. Very green and with shaded pitches. In August they don't accept bookings for less than a week. Tauran beach is accessible from the campsite with a 10-minute walk"
86642,2998401,4,PierreETSylvie,21/07/2023,"Correct pitch because on 2 pitches, with a 6m c was good. Beach 200m away with pebbles and quickly in the shade"
86642,2984509,1,garrigs,18/07/2023,"We did not get to stay, as soon as we arrived they were a bit serious and dry when checking, we brought a small dog, and they tell us that if we assure her that she does not bark, we tell her that she does not usually bark, to which she does not say If we don't make sure of it, we couldn't stay, they are dogs, not machines that you can program. Anyway, we went to Cudillero and they were super friendly and respecting the pet rules"

86642,2847546,4,maschaontrack,12/06/2023,Quiet clean nature campsite. For the Dutch (it looks like campsites from the green book) bar for breakfast/coffee. Very friendly staff. Helpful! English ! Nice shower .. a bit improvised with shower curtains. It didn't bother me at all. Really narrow spots !! 20€ 1 pers with camper and dog without electricity. Walk to beach very! Steep but beautiful spot
86642,2350636,1,belette12,08/09/2022,"This campsite is already closed when it was supposed to close on September 20, too bad a detour for nothing, we found a superb place next door at the end of the road on the right when we left."
86642,2335890,4,enrutalibre,03/09/2022,"very quiet small family campsite. The children's activity in the afternoon is very interesting, visiting the animals, orchard.... a charming monitor. We have been very satisfaced."
86642,2210409,3,SebiMercy,10/08/2022,"Nice campsite on the cliffs. Lots of shade, small supermarket. However, the allocation of places is arbitrary, there is no system and no overview of free places. The takeaway portions at the restaurant are overpriced and small. There is potential for improvement!"
86642,2041153,5,Perceval33,05/07/2022,"no extraordinary view of the sea but calm this day. open contrary to other notices, we had sent an email to find out in advance. 2 km from the town of Luarca."

86642,1580444,1,MDC38,15/09/2021,"Firm ! No indication except at the entrance, after almost 3 km of small narrow roads! Uncool."
86642,1444065,3,GemaGB,12/08/2021,"Crowded and tight campsite. Correct plots, separated by large hedges. Space is shared on the sides with other campers. Spacious bathrooms but they have curtains in the showers, somewhat unsanitary. Rules for dogs, correct but they are explained to you very strict. Somewhat dry in reception or serious, they inhibit your stay. Beach next door and pretty towns nearby to visit. There is a square"
86642,1405871,4,bienmesabe,04/08/2021,"Correct for its price, a lot of noise and hustle and bustle of families with children, many users share space in caravans, huts, and cabins, several showers and toilets that need more frequent cleaning"
86642,1368029,4,VijfdeWiel,26/07/2021,"In itself a cozy campsite that we have good memories of. The older lady at the front desk didn't seem happy with our doggy (no barking). She also didn't seem happy with our 7m camper to accommodate it. There were therefore few campers on this campsite. The beach, 50 meters below, was 300 meters away and smelled a bit. The beach at Luarca turned out to be better."
86642,1361661,4,wendellthingre,25/07/2021,"Nice place, reasonable clean and well kept. One of the few places that has decent restaurant food with vegetarian options. Nice little well stocked shop as well. It’s bustling though, and packed in like sardines, but it was quiet at night."
86642,1329326,5,park4night31071980,16/07/2021,"Just beautiful! Absolute recommendation! Dogs have rules here, but they are absolutely acceptable and should be part of it (not barking, on a leash, certain breeds excluded)."

86642,1286759,5,D0m1n1c,30/06/2021,"Great location, very quiet and shaded pitches, if needed. If following sat-nav from the east, don't drive through Luarca. It might send you up calle la perla - avoid it - there's a 6m length limit & the road is narrow. Go around the town on the motorway."
86642,1023802,5,cperaile,03/09/2020,"We came on the rebound from the Los Cantiles campsite, which we do not recommend due to disastrous attention and we found ourselves in a charming place, with more than acceptable attention and a privileged location.

86642,1004244,3,meschede,26/08/2020,"The price makes it attractive. 2 adults plus dog 17 € / night without electricity. Beautiful view. Nice beach or bay around the corner. Sanitary facilities are relatively unhygienic despite regular cleaning, no soap on the toilet, which causes many not to wash their hands and then go to the supermarket with unwashed hands. The dryer does not dry if someone intends to wash! Otherwise very nice reception with a small restaurant and a small supermarket where you can get everything you need."
86642,944478,4,LetiR,09/08/2020,"Spent 2 family nights with our van. Small, well organized campsite. Clean sanitary facilities, small but pleasant swimming pool and nearby beaches. Machine and dryer welcome, as is the simple but delicious catering."

86664,3288794,5,hjsi10,12/09/2023,nothing to say except amazing. bumpy ride through village to get there but we have an 8m motorhome and we were fine.  2 other campervans joined later ... one at 2am which I thought was unacceptable to drive through the village at that time.  few dogs barking across river as sons travels.  few flies but picturesque and quiet.
