88388,1330794,4,aplikacion,16/07/2021,"Nothing new to say except to remember that MOTOR VEHICLES ARE FORBIDDEN FROM 1 TO 8 AM ON THE MONTHS OF JULII, AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER."
88388,928522,4,Javicamo,04/08/2020,"Beautiful enclave and highly recommended beach. Not being able to spend the night seems reportable to me. If the rules are respected, I do not see the impediment and more when they leave at other times of the year."
88388,848717,4,mcervan,04/07/2020,"Well, I have to announce that as of today, overnight stays in the whole area of Pita beach are prohibited. With a sign that prohibits any motor vehicle from 1 a.m. to 8 a.m."

88392,2113112,1,gulan,23/07/2022,"Sloping space, cramped and not easily accessible."
88392,1503252,4,tigerman64,23/08/2021,"Pleasant and quiet site, not easy to find a more or less horizontal place. Too bad that in the uncultivated terraced field just above one cannot settle down. We got fired. Place by the river."
88435,2125371,5,evaorlhac,26/07/2022,"Great spot, we spent the night there alone and everything went very well. I recommend !!"
88435,1513484,1,DiegoQuintana,26/08/2021,"Fabulous site, but indeed, the local police in the area warned us at 3:00 AM that we were sanctioned for ""bad parking"", without having any sign or anything that prevents the passage or parking in the area, although being full of Cars during the day, they said that, ""during the day they turn a blind eye"", join me, because I'm going to resort!"
88435,1422105,2,DanyGarness,08/08/2021,"The place is very beautiful. At 7:00 p.m. I was full of cars and vans, so I decided to return at 10:00 p.m. I was alone, it seemed strange to me since on the other side of the lake were the other ACs and some van. But I stayed there since the music from the chiringuito was less heard. at 8:00 a Civil Guard fine. I'm going to appeal it. No sign or anything to block the way"
88435,1420581,3,nuskag,07/08/2021,"The site is beautiful, but the Seprona just fined us this afternoon simply for being parked on what they say is a forest track. The fact is that it is not signposted in any way and. there is nothing to prevent the passage. If you cannot park, logically you will not be able to stay overnight either."
88435,1393107,4,Carlosmude,02/08/2021,"Wonderful site but a bit dirty, in our case the Civil Guard did not notify and denounced us directly"

88435,1149597,4,cifus,10/03/2021,"The place is wonderful, beautiful, quiet, you wake up listening to the singing of the birds. But to enter with our 7.4 and 3 meters high you have to do a thousand maneuvers, this now, in spring with the new shoots in the trees I no longer think we can pass. There is no service, but if something is needed there is an area very close."
88435,924586,5,pablan,03/08/2020,"Quiet place right in front of the Playa de los Molinos, where you can be with your pets (on the beach there is a sign forbidden dogs) and take a bath. There is good left over and it is a good place to stay overnight."

88450,390925,5,moleynav,10/10/2018,"Absolutely incredible spot, totally secluded and right by the lake which we swam in. however, a warning... road is very bumpy and to get to the spot we squished our 6 foot van between trees and bushes and managed to lose a side light. not for the feint hearted or large motorhomes! however totally worth it if you can."
88531,1058626,4,dd74,19/09/2020,"Quiet area, passage of cows and a donkey .. very nice .. the fording is to be taken slowly and is well done in a 6 m motorhome. Barbecue .. Water, WC closed, because of the Covid?"
88531,889427,2,Andoni.G,22/07/2020,We just passed. We wanted to take a bath but the water was too stagnant and we didn't dare go in. The very complicated parking for motorhomes

88536,1764534,5,cintyapinilla,24/02/2022,"We were two days ago. It is an esplanade of flat land, but the views are great. If you go at night it is a bit difficult to see the entrance and there are some potholes, it is better to go slowly. Very quiet night."

88536,1466611,5,AgataSNeila,16/08/2021,"It is the parking lot of the swamp, a quiet place without noise. At night it is spectacular to see the stars and the moon reflected in the water, but it is unfortunate that they allow the company in the industrial estate to have those lights on at night. On the coolest days of summer there is a breeze, the rest of the year there is some wind"

88536,491355,5,lagadou93,24/05/2019,"Small nice place out of the highway 2 km, a bit wind related to the valley. Had our meal in the sun surrounded by small mountains at the lake? no water, no trash, wild place to leave clean"

88614,2892691,4,Maktedelic,25/06/2023,"Everything fits here! You just stand. Footpath to the river 50m and to the sea 100m. Quiet, dark, free. We were standing there with another van. Little human excrement and toilet paper. Apparently the ""bag trick"" is used consistently here (garbage cans available.) During the day it is moderately full of locals. Restaurant/bar next door. Unfortunately a lot of mosquitoes. Mosquito net is mandatory!"
88614,2813061,5,michajung,02/06/2023,"Very nice quiet place with lots of space. Large beach directly in front of it, accessible via footbridges, garbage cans available, restaurants too. Beautiful paths for walking the dog or for hiking."
88614,2681134,5,Wunderkinder,19/04/2023,"Absolute dream place, away from tourism and city life. We were completely alone at night and only a car or two came during the day, the beach is pretty much empty, it's amazing, a beautiful bay and the kids can even play in the shallow river with no waves and even walk across at low tide. The nights are absolutely calm, the waves can hardly be heard. Really fabulous here, thank you."
88614,2646101,5,ali_mit_a,07/04/2023,"I agree with the previous speaker who apparently spent the same night with us at this spot ;) It was very quiet, the place is spacious and easily accessible via the dirt road that leads down. There are rubbish bins and there is actually a water point at the top, but without a connection, you could probably only fill canisters here. We found the beach very nice, it is small."
88614,2645798,5,hidro,07/04/2023,"Very quiet place, next to the sea and the river. Ideal for children. The parking lot is ample, without delimiting and with a lot of grass. We stayed at night about 6 motorhomes and Campers very well. With a restaurant next door but they open from 9. The beach is not wonderful but we found children playing and ours was able to play with them."
88614,2386666,5,Tiramillas2021,19/09/2022,"We stopped without spending the night. The esplanade is field and quite level. Next door is the beach, beautiful, by the way, there is also a bar - restaurant. There are no services but there is a water source 20 meters away."
88614,2331307,5,Mbwa,02/09/2022,"2 nights spent in this car park (empty during the week at the end of August). Environment, beaches, hikes everything is at the top! Also a very good restaurant. Do not count on the water point, suddenly the water flows, suddenly more water! We didn't understand anything. Easy access for all CC lengths."
88614,2322382,4,frangarca,30/08/2022,"We slept very peacefully, the car park is huge, dirt but flat. Next to Seiruga beach."

88614,2321131,5,txampe,30/08/2022,It is a beach car park where cars are parked and there is a bar nearby where you can eat. We slept very calmly despite being almost alone and a very nice beach to spend the day. The beach had showers but no water.

88614,2223758,4,Fleff31,12/08/2022,"Beautiful beach and ria!! The parking lot is spacious and flat, no view from the parking lot though. For the restaurant, it is better to book in high season, it was full. The beach is reported to be dangerous but the ria allows you to swim in safety. Easy passage even for large sizes. A shower is on the way leading to the beach, a fountain allows you to fill up your canister."

88614,2155341,5,mapeanda,01/08/2022,"site of 10, but awnings, tables etc etc outside ... soon they will also kick us out, I hope we are consistent and this attitude ends soon and we can enjoy this place for a long time"

88614,1290323,5,lovaj,02/07/2021,"This is an amazing spot: beautiful view, very quiet and very friendly neighborhood. Instead of the parking, I suggest the road on the left, which will give a better view of the bay (sea view is blocked by a hill in the parking)"

The car park was also very quiet, almost no other cars and lit up at night."

The train passes by but it doesn't make noise. In Alicante it is difficult to park. 60 tourist places and 10 large sites. Full during the day and at night you have a safe place.
88951,2615949,3,momoHenri,19/03/2023,Parking not very crowded on Sundays and in this case very practical for visiting Alicante. Tram a little higher or on foot down towards the sea to join the ramble and then turn right for the old town.

Next to a park with water fountains and shade. You can take the tram into town or walk. Until the Marina we did 15 minutes; the rest of us walked along the promenade and in another 10 min. we arrived at Porta del Mar. It was our best option to visit the city."

No noise at night and very safe"

88957,3276011,5,rikesoares01,09/09/2023,The park is excellent. I’ve seen some negative comments about the campground but I think it’s pretty nice. If you have a camper you have some nice places to put it under the trees. For tents it’s even better because you can find a place with a sea view and lots of shade.   The comodities and very nice and the pool and bar area are very neat….   You can walk to the nearest beach. Lots of trekking..

89259,2343392,3,PascalJ.,05/09/2022,"nice place, but the only way to officially reach the parking lot is through an overpass with a maximum height of 1.9 m. At a height of 1.97 m, that was too risky for me."
89259,2194665,3,esponcea,08/08/2022,The site looks very good. But we can't get access. From Santa Susana the road is under construction. From Pineda the passage under the tracks is very small and the one above the tracks the police did not allow us to pass. A shame…
89259,1155571,3,hokeoinlove,22/03/2021,"We arrived at 8:00 p.m. and at 9:00 p.m. the urban guard passed and kicked us out, very nice for that, but you cannot stay overnight even if there is no sign."

89417,2954420,5,albamika,12/07/2023,Perfect in its kind! You won't be alone but there is space. Favorite for the donkeys and horses in freedom. 10 minutes walk from the cave of leze which is worth the detour. We bathed near the waterfall in very cool water. Sound of the stream and the bells of the horses. We bought cheese from the farm next door.
89417,2679611,4,Onderweg63,18/04/2023,"Great place. We have opted for the 'large' parking space. Nice in the sun. The approach road is a bit narrow (we drive in a camper) turn right over the bridge, over the animal grid and you're there. For us, wonderfully quiet beautiful nature."
89417,2621632,3,moritzkaden,23/03/2023,"In my opinion, not a particularly nice place. There is a lot going on and the place is very sloping. It is positive to note that garbage cans are available and there are very nice hiking routes."

89417,2340774,5,Kracser,05/09/2022,"A beautiful place. We spent a very quiet night in the large parking lot, all alone. Apart from spring water and garbage cans, there is no supply. There are many hiking trails that require sturdy shoes. When it rains, the paths are certainly very soft. A large picnic area is also available. Below the cave you could take a refreshing bath. water is very cold."

89417,2236290,4,kursive,14/08/2022,"Good place, we have only eaten here on the way. The cave is worth seeing. Many vans and caravans but well spaced, if you like to sleep alone better at the point of Galarreta which is 10 minutes away."
89417,2227985,5,JordiD,13/08/2022,"Easily accessible, The place is frequented mainly by visitors by car who have spent time near the cave There were still several places available on arrival There is a water source a few meters away The walk at the foot of the Leze cave deserves to be seen Animals are familiar to man and will not want to come near you. Avoid feeding them!"
89417,2198338,5,Deschloe,08/08/2022,"A corner away from the cave easily accessible. Enough space not to be on top of each other. Surrounded by wild donkeys and the herd of sheep led by the dog, magnificent. No amenities. Quiet in the evening we were 3 in the chosen area."
89417,2076013,5,hectordecampor,15/07/2022,"Beautiful, I can really recommend it! The cave nearby is very cool, there's wild horses walking around and the stream has really clear water. If you're lucky you will even see the flock of sheep herded by their guarddog roaming around. It's super quiet at night and it's a little cooler so it's great if you're looking for a place to cool down. Please keep it clean :)"

89483,3225376,5,M.G.S,27/08/2023,"Flat parking near the port area, with a lot of movement of motorhomes and vans. Perfect to visit the beautiful town and quiet to spend the night. Do not try to reach the town with large vehicles, since arriving at the town there is only parking for residents and it would be difficult to maneuver. Thanks for this space."
89483,3220014,4,MariaLuixa,26/08/2023,A good place to spend the night. 10 minutes walk from town. Plenty of flat seats and ACs to fit. There are also some privileged places overlooking the sea. The town is really beautiful!
89483,3193404,3,kevincampervan,21/08/2023,"a lot of influx in high season, during the day a lot of traffic, quiet night, as a negative point, visitors who come by car take advantage of the fact that it is full of AC and campers to pee behind them (so everything smells like pee) a little dirty but for sleeping one night and seeing the town is ""fine"" (you don't have another one in this place near the town)"
89483,3173430,4,AAMDGSM,18/08/2023,"Mixed space (cars and AC), you can walk to the city on flat ground. Great turnover of parked vehicles, if there is no place just wait a little for someone to leave. Negative points: port area so some dirt and subject to the elements. no services"
89483,3170497,5,cochecamper307,17/08/2023,"About 10 minutes walk from the town. Quiet place but close to the road. To spend a good night, but now."
89483,3165417,5,David_Bedia,17/08/2023,Parking without more in the port. Nice walk to the town of about 5 or 10 minutes. The squares are minutes for AC. The ones further on were full of cars and I found them very difficult to maneuver.
89483,3157784,5,maitanemorcillo,16/08/2023,"The 5 stars because it's great to spend a night. We went with a van but it was full of ACs. Parking without unevenness and very quiet at night, hardly any traffic is heard. The Cudillero town 8 minutes walk, for a beautiful walk. I recommend this car park."
89483,3153933,3,grberm,15/08/2023,"We arrived early and found parking with no problem. The vehicles that were next to the sea on the part of the wall ended up soaked by the waves. Be careful with the road before reaching the car park, it is very steep and with sharp curves. Very level parking and 7 or 8 minutes walk from the town"
89483,3152968,5,laurasi,15/08/2023,"Stayed one night, easy with large motohome (8 metres), it a classic free location, with flat ground and a beautiful view, we cycled into the town and had great food, the town is lovely and great fun with children."

89483,3150778,3,Elilya,15/08/2023,"Positive sides: 10' walk from the center, along the sea and the pier, so very beautiful panorama and the sound of the waves (between 1am and 7am). Negative sides: the rest of the time, the noise of the waves is drowned out by that of the cars (road as close as the ocean), and the noise of the comings and goings of other motorhomes... it still spoils a lot! The vehicles are really parked next to each other"
89483,3134542,4,menchosa,13/08/2023,"Good place to spend the night and see Cudillero. There is a lot of entry and exit of vehicles, with a little patience you end up parking. Regarding places to eat, there is something to bore you, a very gastronomic town from what you can see. The night of arrival we had dinner at Julio's house, very friendly but the portions were very small for the price paid."
89483,3105184,5,larrilg,09/08/2023,"Super quiet place at night. 10 minutes from the town. Lots of vans and caravans, but all great. Of course, if you park near the opening to the sea, the car will get wet no matter what!"
89483,3089267,4,elgumiasdel90,06/08/2023,Parking away from the town 5 minutes walk from the town. With toilets and shower between the middle of the town and the parking lot. I spent day and night without problem. No police presence. Lots of vans and AC. You sleep by the sea. I was very comfortable
89483,3071788,3,chity1,03/08/2023,"Parking without more where to spend the day and night, the waves will wet your vehicle when the tide rises depends on where you park. Very nice town but I think it's better to visit in low season"

89483,2985278,2,requingris,18/07/2023,"Parked behind the harbor breakwater and squeezed in like sardines, the interests lay in the views of the nearby creeks, the harbor and the village itself which is not far to visit. We are only tolerated, therefore distrust of the Polićia. No water or electricity. Place more or less clean and above all very calm - lulled by the waves."
89483,2976339,5,kakalica,17/07/2023,"Very good place to visit Cudillero and sleep for free and without services, very very quiet night. Recommended place to spend the night listening to the waves of the sea. Lots of cars and vans."

89483,2920661,5,MireilleBruno,03/07/2023,"we recommend the places facing the sea. You will be lulled by the sound of the waves, which drown out even the little noise from the road. One of the best nights of our vacation. The town is very close (about 10 minutes on foot) with many restaurants including La Paloma which we recommend."
89483,2915798,5,Jacou61,02/07/2023,A magnificent view and… watered. We were there on July 1 and the magnificent town of Cudillero was celebrating. We were then able to stroll through the many alleys of this admirable city. The view from the belvedere is simply splendid. Thank you to the municipality for allowing us to enjoy these wonders. Not to mention the spectacle of the waves hitting the dike in the parking lot.
89483,2902641,5,marinafrigola,28/06/2023,"Fantastic place with a spectacular sunset, super comfortable and very close to the town."
89483,2892955,5,sanmy,26/06/2023,"We spent a perfect night, but only the 4 squares in the back that face the sea have good views, in June everything is very quiet, there is a fountain nearby (300m) where the markets are, where it says the ice factory, when you enter that street . In 10 minutes walking you are in Cudillero"
89483,2853097,4,CattinJ,14/06/2023,"Wonderful parkup right next to the rocks and sea if you can get a space right at the end. 
We were worried how high the tide would reach but no issues on the calm night we were there. Slept to the sound of waves on rocks.
A stroll into town with lots of food/ drink options and free toilets in the social centre.
Thank you for this memorable free parkup."

89483,2740638,4,janomio,11/05/2023,We had to move to the entrance to the car park because of the waves at high tide which came over the pier and splashed the vehicles. Very nice view at sunset.
89483,2736200,5,SMC1957,09/05/2023,"We stop to walk. We did not spend the night although it seems allowed. They fit about eight or ten motorhomes. There are no services. Excellent place to visit Cudillero, one of the most beautiful towns in Spain. Thank you!"

89483,2660473,5,Nat64,11/04/2023,"parking lot at the harbor entrance, just in front of the dike wall. quiet for the night. The listed village 10 minutes away is really worth the detour"

89483,2459480,5,VivianaCld,24/10/2022,"We have spent one night here with 9 or 10 other ACs. The space is wide enough to maneuver and very comfortable to visit the town, which is a few minutes' walk away. The views are incredible and at night you can only hear the roar of the sea. At about 7 in the morning, cars and trucks begin to pass on the road next door and you can hear something, but nothing that bothers. 100% recommended site."
89483,2445842,5,olimpox,15/10/2022,A wonderful site. During the day it fills with people to see this beautiful town.
89483,2428530,3,rvlifesweden,07/10/2022,"With the mountains in the back, the roaring ocean and just 10 minutes walk to centre, this could easy be a perfect space. Unfortantly, not all campers have access to toilet aparently… human feaces laying in the corners is really unpleasent!"

89483,2355306,5,javyalonso,09/09/2022,"We have spent a very quiet night together with more AC. Ideal to visit Cudillero. The downside: that people urinate next to the wall and it smells terrible, so be careful if you want to open the window when sleeping or similar."
89483,2337798,5,eit026,04/09/2022,"We have slept there several times and great. Flat parking lot with the sound of the waves at night. 3 minutes by bike and 12 minutes walking from the center. Perfect for visiting the town, as it cannot be accessed with AC. There is room for about 20-25 AC, but as they say in other comments, cars also park in the parking lot and depending on the time there may not be room."

The only thing that is shared with cars and you have to arrive early or late in the afternoon if not bad .. !! And more on these dates..!! By the way, stop by for lunch or dinner at El Remo...!! A lot of fame but very bad..!!! Best Casa Mari that is next door and they are great!!"

89483,2258204,3,RiccardoTodaro,17/08/2022,The only and valid solution to see the delightful oaesino of Cudillero inside which it is forbidden to enter with the camper. We also slept one night with the sound of the waves crashing just behind the dock.
89483,2235160,3,marcangouleme,14/08/2022,I only put 3 stars because cars come to this car park which should be reserved for motorhomes. Services are provided free of charge at the supermarket. Tourist city that is worth the detour.
89483,2235042,4,naroaarce,14/08/2022,"Parking with very nice and quiet views, but when the tide rises you can hear the waves hitting the rocks. 10-15 minutes from downtown."
89483,2219874,4,franjgr,11/08/2022,"Although it is big, it gets busy and it is not exclusive to AC so when the car park is full, they also try to park the cars. Any other car park will be much further away to see the town. I witnessed how a vehicle (and not precisely AC) left leaving its garbage in the parking lot, so it's normal that it's dirty, that's how human beings are."
89483,2208273,5,Sandrachallenger,10/08/2022,We have slept very well and very calm. Overnight stays are allowed without camping. It is ten minutes from the town on foot to the port. The town is beautiful.

89483,1518626,4,LlucHymmer,27/08/2021,"Good place to spend a night. Easy access, near Cudillero, 20 min on foot, and next to the sea. Some noise of cars from being stuck to the road.

89483,1000104,3,susana.marb,25/08/2020,"Good overnight parking. No services, but quiet and safe. 10 minutes from town. AC cannot pass from there. By the way, it is a shame that some leave garbage and all kinds of waste, and the rules are not followed, and thus it is impossible for the ACs to be well considered. Nobody admits to being a pig but the truth is that there are, and some have passed through this area."

It's a shame, because the area is great!"
