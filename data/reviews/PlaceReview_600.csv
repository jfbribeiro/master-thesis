18802,3195128,5,L.Vieira,21/08/2023,"Service area with everything working. Plenty of parking space, in the shadow of the Sports Pavilion. We spent two very peaceful nights. Many thanks to the municipality for the space it made available to motorhomes. The village of Murça is small, but very well maintained. People are nice. And don't forget to try the chila queijadas, they are delicious and typical of this small Trás-os-Montes village!"
18802,3166184,2,karofamilytravel,17/08/2023,"Emptying of waste water and wc ok, but impossible to fill the water tank. Tip not uniform to those of France or Spain to fill. Damage . Fortunately, a motorhome lent us a jerry can and a funnel to fill it up, otherwise we would have had to go elsewhere."
18802,3163684,4,Nadlingo,16/08/2023,"Good for one night. Were there with 2 other campers. Place quite straight, but permanently illuminated at night and therefore quite bright. Unfortunately, no toilets nearby."
18802,3128299,5,PatotazOne,12/08/2023,"For the cassette wash faucet to work, you have to push it in. Depending on the desired duration, it is pushed more or less"
18802,3126578,5,rossa,12/08/2023,"Perfect for sleeping. We slept next to 2 other campers. Clean and flat area. It is the stadium car park in the town, but with water loading and unloading services."
18802,3091296,5,Vespita,06/08/2023,Very quiet location with access to evictions and free water supply. Thank you Municipality of Murça
18802,3080579,5,nonoleb71,05/08/2023,Area to drain at the top. Everything works and it's free. Small village that looks very quiet
18802,2805092,5,Fedia,31/05/2023,"stayed overnight, water loading and unloading very comfortable. waste basket present .. very quiet place. advised!!!!"
18802,2724179,4,bertiebuggie,05/05/2023,"Excellent, clean services with a lot of water pressure. The parking is not specifically for motorhomes and the bays are standard ones. Longer vans will not fit unless they park across multiple bays. The night we stayed was football practice night and there were lots of people and lots of cars until about 10pm. The town is good with a lot of shops within easy walking distance."
18802,2697400,1,LudietMax,26/04/2023,"reading the comments I thought we were going to be quiet.. it's 1am and I'm living my worst night. loud music, party, lots of young people. and the height of people who believe they are alone with their motorhome which takes up 4 places. we had to get stuck on one of the places to drain! we won't be back!"
18802,2649024,4,ptcarlospt,08/04/2023,"It is not very clear which places are dedicated for motorhomes, but we spent a quiet night and in the morning we did the trail on the city walkways. I recommend"
18802,2648366,3,Hoodma,07/04/2023,"Perfect area for a stopover on the way. Service system perhaps a bit uncomfortable to empty grey, although there are two side sewers that help in my case by having the drain in the center of the bus. Impeccable clean water refill system, separated from the pot. Silence in the night. Thanks for that area. Next time stop to visit area."
18802,2629188,2,Mijeanne,29/03/2023,Free but impractical services especially for large motorhomes. The large car park is extremely steep. Everything deserves to exist. Thanks to the municipality.
18802,2579007,5,viajandogeral,15/02/2023,"Well worth a visit, thanks to Comarca for the space, funny village and an excellent pedestrian route on the Tinhela river. I recommend visiting the cellar. Clean services and close to everything."
18802,2547842,5,Heasman22,09/01/2023,"Very quiet and central, level hardstanding with services. Supermarket next door and easy walk to centre. Thanks to the local council"
18802,2513258,5,raul1996,05/12/2022,shared parking with cars. When we arrived it was full of cars from the Sports Center. We waited for a while and around 8:00 p.m. it was empty. do not use the water services but a 10 for Murça
18802,2483192,5,Pakotinta,05/11/2022,"perfect free place to spend the night, with filling and emptying of water, as soon as we arrived the police came to kindly ask us if we were going to spend the night and not to worry about anything because they made rounds, I have never felt so safe in an area of these hehehehe the truth that is appreciatedIt is very close to the town.Located in the sports center of the town where there is also a guard"
18802,2446779,5,valentinangel,16/10/2022,Great place to drain no electricity but very quiet great for a safe and quiet night thank you
18802,2303995,5,Karma39,26/08/2022,Perfect place to drain and fill up with water!
18802,2295364,5,motofly,24/08/2022,an example for other municipalities. free and very clean.
18802,2294647,5,ninififilulu,24/08/2022,"Very clean place to empty the cassette, continue to keep this place clean, there are very few thanks to the municipality"
18802,2286419,5,nico1444200,22/08/2022,Impeccable place to empty and fill gray water and black water indeed a small problem of calculation at the level of the making of the gutter which obliges some of us to have some maneuvers in the climb on the sidewalk but nothing good villain impeccable thank you to the municipality for thinking about the motorhome
18802,1827772,4,FerdiVan21,16/04/2022,We had a very quiet night! Good opportunity to run a round with the dog. Free drinking water and disposal of grey-black water. Thanks to the community!

18802,1708427,2,agfsantos,11/12/2021,"Apparently quiet, but I couldn't put water through the non-adapted tap, confirming the previous posts"
18802,1600708,3,Manu88,22/09/2021,"It is not an area, only a water change point, parking is for any vehicle. You have to put your ass on the sidewalk to be able to empty into the grate and the taps are push-button and without thread, which is why you have to park the hose as you can. I appreciate you thinking about the acs, but the thread for the hose please ..."
18802,1577349,2,Tigomgom,14/09/2021,"Drainage grid flush with the sidewalk, impractical. No drinking water, push-button tap. Calm but we will go further."
18802,1491331,5,Traildreamer,21/08/2021,"Clean and well-kept place. Perfect for emptying the waters. The town is very nice, ideal for shopping. There is a market on Thursday. Highly recommended"
18802,1455274,4,Catalina19,14/08/2021,We only use it to stay overnight and continue our journey. quiet place. asphalted. level. easy access. gratuitous. loading and unloading. next to the sports center. Thanks to the people for offering this service
18802,1205209,4,vhtrindade,18/05/2021,"We spent a quiet night here, in fact the site is just a service area, there is a park next door, but there is no motorhome park warning, so the light of the new law the authorities can approve. The water tap has no thread, which makes filling the tank a little difficult."
18802,1155779,5,sunnybird,22/03/2021,"A very nice quiet camper place. A tip, ask the manager of the stadium if you can use the shower. A supermarket around the corner. On working days you can hear the children in the schoolyard, for the rest it is wonderfully quiet."
18802,1136279,5,Maikyu,09/02/2021,Very quiet place with a very nice patrolling guard. Only motorhome in our period. All services except electricity

18802,1031960,5,BubbleGun,07/09/2020,"Great!!! The stadium keeper even offered to take a shower! Very calm, flat and the Auchan is right next door! Perfect location!"
18802,980198,4,Betito,19/08/2020,"Calm and quiet place, well lit and has the presence of a helpful municipal guard at the football stadium and sports center at night. The ASA is very clean and well presented, although the water supply tap does not have a thread. Thanks to the municipality."
18802,748878,4,Dune49,01/12/2019,"A little hello retirees Maine and Loire, not easy to find parking in Murça, but the stadium is great, arrived at 18h we spent a very quiet night. A 5th star if there had been toilets, to troubleshoot the supermarket Auchan at 100 m, open 7/7 days!"
18802,720273,2,fulltimetrip,13/10/2019,There is no thread for the water .. damage.
18802,715995,5,alain57320,08/10/2019,"Quiet place, we had a good night without forgetting the keeper of the stadium very friendly and who monitors the place"
18802,710437,5,nadben,01/10/2019,"Welcomed by the caretaker, he even offers us a shower.On is comfortable."
18802,530350,5,Gijon,27/06/2019,"newly created double area. Everything correct and clean, ideal for use on the Bragança / Oporto / Ponte de Lima route"
18802,526028,1,Tedward,23/06/2019,"Sadly the park was full of cars when we arrived (4pm on a Sunday) and the approach road was full of skid marks, so we left!      The facilities looked clean and new, but no screw fitting for the water :("
18802,518550,4,amicalement,17/06/2019,"Calm and tranquility. Drain nickel, but no filtering at the tap of drinking water, damage."

18802,170230,3,gchrismiche,10/08/2017,Clean and quiet although close to the city we had a quiet night. View of the hills.
18802,43097,5,jl2710,20/07/2015,"Excellent home of the guardian of the sports complex, really top for a quiet night."
18834,2909729,4,ManiTheVani,01/07/2023,Great area close to the metro to access the city. Bit of noise on the road and some people playing music until late
18834,2878858,5,JordanHollins,21/06/2023,Clean and quiet area. Great links into the city and a nice green right by the parking.
18834,2784958,4,hugocamper,25/05/2023,"Very quiet place at night, safe (we left a sliding window open all day and nothing happened) parking is a matter of luck. There are several playgrounds, a garden to walk the dog. Subway nearby. Supermarket 500 meters. We have been there for 3 days and very well."
18834,2725422,3,ikerlee,05/05/2023,We stayed one day without spending the night. Weekdays it is difficult to find a place. We found it safe and it is a 5 minute walk to the metro. Free .
18834,2712031,5,familiasobreruedas,01/05/2023,"We were lucky to find a parking space in the free area and we took the metro in a 10-minute walk to visit Madrid, without problems"
18834,2694704,5,Yann32,24/04/2023,"We arrived on a Sunday noon and found a place along the park opposite the entrance to the cemetery. Otherwise it is better to arrive there after 7 p.m. This spot is 500m from La Elipa metro station less than 10 minutes to El Retiro Park. The negatives: noisy until 1 a.m. with lots of passing cars, and from 7 a.m., but the free parking more than makes up for it!!"
18834,2438301,1,wanderstruck632,11/10/2022,"At the time of writing this, the parking lot is closed with barricades"
18834,1953216,3,MC4333,06/06/2022,The best thing are the trees and the shade they give. Elipa metro 500 meters (6 minutes walk)
18834,1848267,4,Edel,23/04/2022,"We spent the night from Friday to Saturday, and everything was very quiet. We had no problem staying overnight. I recommend it for a visit to Madrid."
18834,1751374,4,Jesusete98,09/02/2022,"“Quiet” car park 1 hour walk from the center. It's fine, to sleep it's quiet but cars always pass by the sides although not too many."
18834,1737087,5,Algof,19/01/2022,A great place easy to get to and quiet. I recommend
18834,1139041,5,prave,19/02/2021,"I would say that it is one of the best places to park, the bad thing now that they have closed all the sources ... but there is no problem for being here, there is night surveillance outside and inside the cemetery, buses, metro, supermarkets less than 10 minutes walk !"
18834,420890,2,stefaniamiu,07/01/2019,"Sunday night also parties until many. In the evening young people come together to drink and they do not move until late at night. For the day very well because it is guarded by having several florists opened by the cemetery and there is also a lot of car traffic. Great to spend the day but at night if you want to rest, better go 500 meters away since there is also another place where the motorhome to leave a few streets over there."
18834,420608,2,stefaniamiu,06/01/2019,"Last night (Kings day) a party was put together here, music until the end of the day, botellon and young people shrieking. It must be that it coincided with festive. Horrible, we were put up some friends next to discuss their lives and not shut up. The strange thing is that it is right next to the cemetery. In short, worse things have been seen. The good thing about the place that is 5 min. of the metro (Elipa) and 6 direct stops of the Bank of Spain and Sol (line 2). We'll see to see tonight."
18834,133920,2,fanfan34,08/05/2017,"In May 2017, we went there and not stayed. There was a truck to help the drug addicts. And two three drug addicts on the lawn. We preferred not to stay."
18834,77383,3,yarinkel,18/06/2016,Good but on Friday night the young people party until 7 o'clock in the morning
18834,75449,5,Kpitan,03/06/2016,"I think it is one of the best places in Madrid that, curiously, lacks space for AC. The subway is 10 min. walking. Eye, on the left side there is a parking lot, but they usually put flea market and tb is used by driving schools for practices."
18846,3290500,5,JoseCastellano,12/09/2023,"Fuencaliente Lighthouse. Ample parking, it fills up during the day to visit the salt flats. At night it is spectacular, the stars and you can see La Gomera and El Hierro. Very quiet place to rest. To the right there is a callaos beach where you can take a dip. Uncontrolled camping is prohibited according to the sign. But overnight stays are allowed."
18846,2944082,5,alemoto82,10/07/2023,"Large dirt parking lot, next to the coast. It has a callaos beach nearby where you can swim. You can visit the salt flats and the Fuencaliente Lighthouse. At night beautiful views of the lighthouse, starry skies and the lights of the island of El Hierro."
18846,2546527,5,pralinendieb,08/01/2023,"Fantastic place to stay, if your water tank is full and you are not depending on a working internet connection!"
18846,2521558,5,Twoandhalf,14/12/2022,"Google takes you down through intricate little roads if you come from the west coast. Better to stick to the main one (longer but more convenient esp. for bigger homes). Great secluded place, very limited cell coverage, no services"
18846,1894400,3,soniya,16/05/2022,"Very nice views, next to the salt flats. It is somewhat busy, at night there was an excursion and a bus came with many excursionists. Sparse coverage comes and goes."
18846,1380477,5,crisdela,30/07/2021,"Very quiet place, past the lighthouse, leaving it on the left there is a dirt road where there are usually AC and vans, we spent the night there and very well, the only thing that there is a little air but we slept very well."
18846,1258895,5,zeny,16/06/2021,"Very quiet place to spend day and night small beach but very good. there are no services and only one restaurant, although it was now closed. total relaxation and spectacular sunsets."
18846,1139867,5,CampervanTim,20/02/2021,A perfect spot. Very quiet. There is no phone signal but there is open WiFi in the great restaurant. They leave it on at night
18846,1028613,5,singlefin,05/09/2020,"Quiet, magical, silent, great to spend the night and get lost. You spend the night in an ideal setting, the tranquility of the lighthouse is contagious. Many coves nearby where you can take baths. The only cons is that there is hardly any coverage, it comes and goes."
18846,901306,1,Fainada20,26/07/2020,"We couldn't stop in the middle of July, there was a lot of wind and it was completely uncomfortable to stay there. the very beautiful salt flats, next to it walking 5 min."
18846,876784,5,Ernes,18/07/2020,"Idyllic place to spend a few days, very quiet and pleasant, close to several beaches and volcanoes. The only bad thing is that it is usually very windy."
18846,448480,4,alfvde,03/04/2019,"Small parking area (the one below the main area of the Salinas, less busy but fairly steep road). Still manageable with our motorhome. Nice small beach where people swim, directly next to the ocean. Super dark, starry sky and quiet at night. Downside is trash, glass and poo lying around, especially on one side of the parking. If you park right, that can be ignored."
18861,1181107,1,cacharrafamily,28/04/2021,"We went on the road and when we came back they had opened the van and another 2 cars, parking in battery and inclined."
18861,1164016,1,FranciscoNaval,02/04/2021,"It is not suitable for motorhomes. It is a very narrow parking lot and there is a sign that indicates that you have to park on battery, but if you did, you would cut off the path. If you park online you occupy several parking spaces disobeying the signal. VERY uneven terrain, you need to wear shoes, but you expose yourself to the penalty. Otherwise it is great to spend the day, with tables to eat or have a snack."
18861,1114252,3,w638westfalia,11/11/2020,"Quiet place with tables and a fountain, from the parking lot there are several routes through the mountains, some unevenness to spend the night. Please take care of the environment and do not wash the pots with soap in the natural source (as did a woman and her two children still traveling in a motorhome ..)."
18861,1111836,4,lgte,03/11/2020,"Beautiful place and wonderful walks. The sun does not shine much, between trees. Very little mobile coverage. I went in October and it hailed me and it was very cold. The water from the source is very good. Almost the entire parking area is somewhat inclined, or very inclined, it depends."
18861,1111746,3,dynk,03/11/2020,"Good site, some unevenness, on weekends it fills up with people to spend the day, we spent this bridge there and there were two foreign cars taking all the mushrooms in the area ... unfortunate."
18861,1055856,5,Tui,18/09/2020,"The three recreational areas in the area are very good and there is mobile coverage (little signal depending on the company but there is). Fountains, containers, etc. Please leave it clean. Thank you."
18861,951529,5,berjarbour,11/08/2020,"Ideal for summer sleep, very cool and quiet."
18861,867921,4,ger_cha,14/07/2020,Good place to spend the night with tables and a fountain. Before arriving there are another couple of parking lots but we keep this one!
18861,153992,5,miguel.o.d.,18/07/2017,"Very quiet, we sleep in luxury"
18861,102993,4,elgallo,05/09/2016,Very quiet and good mushroom place !!!
18861,102992,4,elgallo,05/09/2016,"Parking on a slope, although you can climb on top, you can be level, tables for lunch, water fountain, and very good routes for walking and cycling, although without services it is recommended"
18865,1931439,1,FRK14,30/05/2022,"WARNING BIG SCAM: The swimming pools are not in service and the bar is closed (so the toilets of the bar are also closed). Not specified at the entrance, which does not prevent them from cashing the 9€. Very expensive for parking."
18865,1728611,2,RubCar,07/01/2022,"A real robbery. €9 to park in a public area and on top of that at 9pm they kick you out, you can't spend the night. There are bathrooms and rubbish bins, plenty of places and level enough to eat."
18865,1247920,3,PabloIturriaga,11/06/2021,"We paid the 9 euros for the entrance fee but in exchange we were able to stay all day and spend the night. At 9 o'clock at night they close the barrier but if you stay nobody says anything, there are clean bathrooms in the bar and you have to leave before 10 o'clock the next day so you don't have to pay again. a pity that because of the covid the pools are empty."
18865,1166574,3,manuelgarciahontangas,04/04/2021,"Spectacular site, although a theft 9 by motorhome until 9 o'clock just park,"
18865,1139564,1,bdepablo,20/02/2021,It is closed on these dates.
18865,430516,3,raultg,17/02/2019,"The site is good but can not be accessed in winter, (at least we have gone on February 15 and throughout the weekend nothing at all)"
18865,312620,2,extremniza,03/08/2018,This year the price has risen to € 9 for cars and motor homes.
18865,203349,4,robertoph,15/10/2017,"Beautiful place, especially out of season. Many excursions on foot and by mountain bike. It is only closed in summer and only charged in summer. It is a parking lot, not a camping ... please be respectful to let us stay overnight."
18867,1334694,4,SergioZgz,17/07/2021,"It is no longer free, but it seems to be fine, let's see how the night was"
18867,750705,5,loscallejas,06/12/2019,"A very quiet place with the river next to it and two children's grounds, a small but beautiful town to walk around and have a drink"
18867,297382,5,bruji,22/07/2018,"Best situation impossible, no noise and if you put on the bottom of the whole ass and shims ac, great."
18867,84311,2,sijaaa,22/07/2016,"Free parking, with views to the mountains, very well located to walk through the town., Not very large."
18891,3258574,3,LeoBlaBar,04/09/2023,"Theoretically, according to the sign, it costs €3 per day, but there is no parking meter and during our stay (beginning of September and during the week) there was no one there in person - so we parked for free. Unfortunately there were a few mosquitoes."
18891,3197650,5,Aliarenita,22/08/2023,"Very quiet site. To be August we were only 4 vans. I arrived around seven in the evening, spent the night and left before 9 without having to pay. As the parking issue is here, it's worth it."
18891,3083267,4,redhotraimon,05/08/2023,"Good points: For only €3 a day you can park and spend the night perfectly, quiet area very close to Sa Riera beach. Bad points: no shade, and there is a height limit (VW type vans up to 2.2m no problem)."
18891,2990914,3,amsanchez05,20/07/2023,"Quiet night, just spend the night. No services. Be careful if you want to wake up late, wake-up service included, at 9 am the man who charges the parking arrives and hits you in the van."
18891,2578279,2,JuditaD.,15/02/2023,"Spent only a day couple of meters from this parking(our van is too high). We parked basically on the street. Very steep,not so comfortable. But the beach is SO STUNNING! amazing cliffs, beautiful views..wow"
18891,2347602,2,distritocamper,07/09/2022,It currently has a barrier of 2.2 meters. Perhaps for small vans there is still a possibility to park and perhaps spend the night.
18891,2214944,3,lolitavan,11/08/2022,"Very quiet night. Close to the beach and the supermarket. The negative part is the little shade that there is, at 9 in the morning the sun practically shines in the entire parking lot."
18891,1875591,1,lauraarisasancho,07/05/2022,"in Begur we are no longer welcome, barrier with limited height. I suppose that the camping has put pressure, they will have to recover the money invested in the works."

18891,1791056,5,saverio64,21/03/2022,free out of season. quiet night. pretty cove and nice walk on the cliffs. quite steep hill to climb to the car park.
18891,1753438,5,JamesEnRoute,12/02/2022,"We have been here one night in January, there is nothing present except for rest, but that was fine for us. From the bay you can make beautiful walks!"

18976,1061949,5,NachoYHedwig,21/09/2020,"Small and family campsite. In September calmer. It has everything you need for the stay. Near Salamanca, for those of us who use the bicycle to get around, it is ideal. It can also be done walking, about 6 km., Along a beautiful walk along the river Tormes. Good restaurant, quite busy so, on weekends, you have to reserve. Many thanks to Ruth at the front desk for her attitude and availability. The campsite closes at the end of September this year, a shame for those looking for quiet places in autumn and winter near cities like Salamanca."
18976,1028660,5,Siljavi,05/09/2020,"We did not need to stay at the campsite with AC. But if we have gone to eat at his restaurant, a 10 for the teamwork of his workers. Clean, delicious food and a great effort that they do so. My most deserved congratulations !!! 100% recommended!"
18976,1018028,5,javialerta,31/08/2020,"Small but very familiar and cozy campsite. Clean state facilities IMPECCABLE. Very good quality-price restaurant (friendliness and professionalism of the waiters and workers at the campsite, EXCELLENT). At the end of August, van with advance, electricity, 2 2 children € 135 x 6 nights (in pitches, for every 4 nights, 1 free). In short, camping of 10, totally recommended. WE WILL BE BACK!!"
18976,1011557,5,LorenaPD,29/08/2020,"Campsite near the center (10 'drive), new and clean bathrooms, friendly staff. There is an option of only overnight for camper, € 14 for 2 people, the van and electricity (entry from 7:30 p.m. and departure before 11 a.m.). Totally recommended !!"
18976,996498,4,nerealagun,23/08/2020,"Camping next to the river Tormes. A few meters from the campsite there is a beach area to bathe in the river in calm waters. With a beautiful area for walking, games, bike and kayak and board rental. We took magnificent and unforgettable baths in the river."

New and clean facilities, very friendly staff. Good breakfasts in the restaurant. Next to the River Tormes and the campsite has canoe rental ... and above all cheap."
18976,952681,4,benyalerta,11/08/2020,"Very good campsite to visit Salamanca. Too bad we could only stay one night due to illness ... fairly spacious pitches and unbeatable price. The only bad detail that I saw, that foreign people did not use the mask in public spaces since in their country it is not mandatory ..... Even so, camping booked to return!"
18976,914558,5,Emis46,31/07/2020,"I give them 5 X the balance. Everything is fine the bar, the service, and the price 26 euros 1 California and 4 people."
18976,730589,4,Mustang85,26/10/2019,"Ideal campsite to visit Salamanca, bike by bike track, on foot or with motor vehicle (parking near the cathedral 3.75 euros for an egg more than three hours.This campsite is very welcoming and has places to accommodate the cc with trailer (13m for me) and without detelé.Les toilets are irreproachable and the table of the restaurant reputed by the locals."

very friendly people"
18976,704910,5,Natalymerlou,26/09/2019,"Pitches large and well separated by a small hedge that respects the privacy of each. Sanitary many, well separated (showers, washbasins, WC) and clean. Friendly staff and multilingual. Bar and restaurant open until midnight. Very good value for money 17 € (a van and 2 people) for one night."
18976,679572,5,dompot,06/09/2019,"We had to spend 2 nights to visit Salamanca, we stayed for 4 nights so we were fine there. Wide and easy pitches for large motorhomes, shade everywhere and a perfect geographical location to reach the city center! (with our scooter). We can only advise"
18976,666416,2,Bernie64,29/08/2019,"Very disappointed, we were looking for a quiet campsite, we asked for a place where we could be quiet. Result: a cacophony, everyone listens to his music, and gradually stronger and finally the bar is an evening that was not announced, and techno until 1am, with drunk people who return on their camp. We slept with earplugs, and shortened our stay."
18976,651975,4,FIRMIN-emmanuel,22/08/2019,"Nice campsite, the restaurant is very good, ""paella and lobster rice"" for a very good price. The sanitary are good. Shaded location but ground to ground. 7 km from Salamanca by bike path very nice or the bus is 800 m well for the evening except for the return to provide flashlight because the road without sidewalk is quite dangerous in the dark."
18976,651441,4,SaraHorta,22/08/2019,"Camping very nice, although in August a bit noisy. WC in good condition and clean. It has a bathtub for babies. great restaurant. mini market with bread and some essentials. Good service area for motorhomes."
18976,640857,3,mickpamg,18/08/2019,"We only stay in campsites when near a big city or if security is in question.  We found Camping Don Quijote is 4-5 kms from the Salamanca centro.  We have a scooter so it was no problem to zoom in and out.  The supermarket has the basic essentials, but there is a new Lidl about 2 kms away.  Everything seems clean and the services are easy to access, most importantly there is plenty of shade."
18976,591164,5,cindydv,01/08/2019,Very nice campsite (but location in the ground). Recent sanitary but lacks some pressure in the shower. The bus to Salamanca is 10 / 15mn walk but it takes a few hundred meters to walk a road without sidewalk. The reception is very pleasant and in French. The mini market is tiny very few choices. Cheap in the middle of July we only pay 15 euros per night for a location without electricity with 2 adults. I will definitely stay here again.
18976,531949,5,Frantine007,28/06/2019,"€ 22 for a camper, 2 adults and electricity. Price very correct."

18976,394605,1,meditador,17/10/2018,"The truth is that something serious or unexplained must have happened: we called to ask if they were open to arrive around 10pm, and they said yes, they would be in the restaurant until 11pm. We arrived before 10:30 p.m. and there was no one at the campsite or at the restaurant, and no one picked up the phone or attended us. Fortunately, a few kilometers away we find the campsite Regio, which is open until 0:00 and we were treated wonderfully (not to mention how good the campsite is). A shame of experience with Camping Don Quijote."

Only the few places reserved for motorhomes are level, but the other places have little inclination and you can sleep well. It is super close to the center, a beautiful little path on foot to get there.

The grey drain is a normal ground drain. There was evidence of unknown persons dumping their black WC cassette here as the evidence would not go through the grate. Discussing..

The black WC drain is not well marked but there is an indication on the pole and a string to lift a grate under the single tap.

There is only 1 tap for fresh water and to clean the cassette and it's not a screw-on connection. You need a rubber connection. It's push button and the flow is slow."

18980,236119,4,lasarastark,13/04/2018,"It is very good as a transit area or to visit Ripoll, emptying and filling services work. There is a cafeteria there and a small picnic area. The only bad thing is that it works like normal parking so it can be quite busy, and it's next to the road so it will not be super quiet like for example Sant Joan de les Abadesses. But very good example for other municipalities"

18980,187946,4,verymar,30/08/2017,Good quiet and bright place. Walk to the greenway and other routes. There are only 4 places but the rest of the parking does not fill up and I do not think they have problems parking. Emptying and filling impeccable. More places like this are needed. Not memorable for the full summer since there is not even a hint of shade that's why I do not give it 5 stars

18980,135646,1,aracxara,17/05/2017,The water source is impossible to connect to any type of hose. It is full of cars so it is difficult to maneuver with a motorhome. There are only three spacious spaces for motorhomes.
18980,130456,2,Ducatovivaboss,23/04/2017,The site is very well to spend the day and night as long as it is not a weekend and this is the Blue pub open. People park in this Area and walk to the pub. They have no regard if you are in the car sleeping. they start talking next to the cars late at night. During the day I give it 5 stars but since we were on the weekend I put 2. It has emptying and filling.
18980,121067,4,vinya,23/02/2017,The water does not work because the tap is broken. but we were able to open the lid (of the two smallest) that is on the floor with a screwdriver and we had water for filling and cleaning the toilet. When financing closed again.
18980,119484,2,luigi20,06/02/2017,Quiet place to spend the night. Good excursions in the area. There is no water but the gray water can be drained. A shame.
18980,118896,1,camilo,26/01/2017,To be well leveled use the platform near the bar and away from the tap. Water is not there Throw the toilet almost impossible by the accumulation of crap. It's a shame they do not keep the area in better condition. We went to find another one. This now only serves to sleep and throw the gray water if you need it a lot. Greetings.

Like a lot of mosquitoes inconvenience, but it's normal, we're in the middle of rice. Personally, I didn't like the fumigation with the customers inside, I think there are other less aggressive actions. This does not detract from the 5 stars."
18988,3285875,5,HelenJorno,11/09/2023,"Gorgeous. Spacious places, impeccable toilets, warm welcome. We rented bikes and cycled 2 hours on the huge beach. Supercalm night. It's a delta, the campsite is in the middle of the rice fields, and who says water, says mosquitoes. We equip ourselves with lotions and enjoy!"

This appears valid on the ACSI website, while the paper guide clearly stipulates the acceptance period from September 13. Otherwise, beautiful location and very clean sea water. Away from everything, it is wise to stock up on supplies before arriving."
18988,3245974,5,Braxx,01/09/2023,"Very nice nature campsite. It has been beautifully designed with the plants and animals, large duck pond with a really excellent restaurant that not only serves good food, but also a lot of it and at an affordable price. The entire facility is very well maintained, a cleaning crew of around 20 people arrive in the morning and make the sanitary facilities a feel-good area. The dusty sandy roads are watered daily to avoid road dust. Several employees clean the plots of eucalyptus leaves and other green waste every day. The reception is very friendly. In no time you are on the beach in a beautiful nature reserve. The only thing to complain about is that the pitches are relatively large, but most of them are open (no separation by bushes, bushes, etc.), which means you have very little privacy. 2 p., 1 dog, pickup camper incl. electricity 38.- / night."

Direct access to the beach by a pretty wooden footbridge. Good restaurant. Only negative point: lacks a bit of space in the shade. We will come back with pleasure.
18988,2913095,4,ccristina,01/07/2023,Camping with many services and very close to the beach. It has a very nice and friendly staff that made both us and our pet feel at home. Some noise due to the volume of people staying there due to the summer season. Lots of mosquitoes!

18988,2796980,4,lesniewska,29/05/2023,"Clean, pleasant, access to a beautiful wide beach. Wonderful neighborhood. A warm shower. Prices in May are very ok. The only drawback is the monstrous crowd in the off-season and unfenced plots. No privacy at all."

The trees offer nice shade on almost all pitches. Overall a nice, calm atmosphere. So we stayed longer than planned. Flamingos can be seen nearby. I advise against bike rental. Had to bring my rental bike into shape with oil and pump myself. The chain broke though..."

18988,2727706,4,tc303,06/05/2023,"Actually, the place is worth 5 stars but: WiFi and reliable and not available in most places. Swimming pool closed on the grounds that it was too cold (24 degrees). Two categories also in the off-season via ACSI, first row, recommended as more privacy and a beautiful view. Adjoining restaurant very good and inexpensive."

18988,2680613,4,quadfan,19/04/2023,"Spacious, quiet and very well maintained. They accept ACSI  out of season.

18988,2320003,2,MiguelMinondo,30/08/2022,"Camping in perfect condition, clean and with all services. The big problem is that if you want rest and tranquility this is not your place. Children running and screaming around the campsite at 12:30 at night, dogs barking, people chatting or watching TV late at night... An aspect to be improved by the campsite management and also more education to be demanded from campers"
18988,2241716,3,hugo106,15/08/2022,"Really idyllic medium-sized campsite. Good place to try out the packed hammock. Direct access to the beach (which is really huge and very beautiful), warm swimming pool which is of course very busy in high season. Bar, restaurant and supermarket right on the square. Unfortunately very expensive in the high season, 40 €/night for one person. Pitches are only partially shaded."

18988,1951740,2,Bibsen,06/06/2022,"It was okay for one night. Nothing special. The plots are rather small and the whole place bare, no plants that offer a bit of privacy. comic atmosphere. Sanitary facilities for clean and good. The restaurant next door had a similarly unpleasant atmosphere (didn't quite live up to the reviews). The paella was good but service was inattentive and there was loud party music playing."
18988,1926927,4,juttabus,29/05/2022,"Beautifully landscaped campsite with partial shade on the pitches. The nature reserve around it is very beautiful and very interesting for bird lovers. At the weekend there are many locals with children and it can get noisy. There are many rice fields around the campsite, the alarm gun sounds regularly.

We have been in the middle of August and the camping is overflowing with people, NOBODY with a mask in common areas, of course this is not the camping's fault.

18988,1008751,1,dgarmendia87,28/08/2020,We have had to go to another nearby campsite because this campsite and the rest of those in the area pressure the free motorhome area so that the caravans with trailers do not park there. They also call the Civil Guard so that no one on the beach stays overnight and you spend more than € 30 just to spend the night in their painful campsite. ENOUGH NOW!

The all you can eat for 8€ (Saturday evening) is great, if you stay away from the prepared Casseroles and such - they tasted like they were kept mildly warm for hours. Fry your own and choose from many side dishes, bread, fruit and desserts."

Parking ideally located to climb to the Mount Veleta Summit, 3496m the highest in Spain we did it by bike ... but electric or 12km, the end is more complicated because the road becomes a path Otherwise if you stay there at night, very windy so not very calm and be careful because when we woke up the parking lot was full of hikers, cyclists. Otherwise small bars at this level so very appreciable after our walk. Otherwise park in the car park a little lower down, there are fewer people."

(There is parking on both sides of the road and all the campers were on the right). It refreshes a lot at night, we had some cold, it changes a lot to sleep there than in Granada. At dusk people come to see the stars (a great sky) and they make a bit of a fuss. In the morning mountaineers start arriving and the parking lot fills up. In spite of everything we sleep very well. In the morning they open the bars if you are too lazy to make breakfast hehe. 100% recommendable."

19022,73995,5,travelpeople,20/05/2016,Beautiful stop. If you can tolerate chill nights there is no problem. In Granada was +30 degrees. Up here ten before sun set and colder during the night. Still snow for snowboarding if u feel to climb up to the hill. We did this and it was fun. Lovely restaurant where u get really nice tapa included with drink which is not usual in this part of the Spain at all. Lots of cyclists and also day hikers. More beautiful views than in your wildest dreams. Highly recommended.

19037,3238269,4,Cutcapers2023,30/08/2023,"The campsite is very good, very clean and spacious bathrooms. Close to the center and the lady very friendly. The only thing that the motorhome pitches should have is grass or foundations because with the rain it becomes impassable mud. High price but normal for the area. 39.50e plot with motorhome with two people and electricity."
19037,2682934,2,Esche101,20/04/2023,"The campsite is ok, but I wouldn't come back because the price/performance ratio is not right: €32 for a small van + €7 WiFi, very small pitches, the surrounding area doesn't offer anything either."

If you want to stay quiet I would say that you have no alternatives: Hondarribia does not like campers, in the various parking lots we have seen, fines were poured into the campers and one of them also saw the tongs on the wheels, despite the fact that the camper was perfectly parked. 38 € for a night in 3 all inclusive ... better at the campsite than in fines"
19037,2012034,3,ChristophB12,26/06/2022,"Pleasant, small campsite near the city. Very friendly and hard-working staff. The pitches are very small and shaded right behind the busy bar. Wedges not necessary. Sanitary facilities in order and clean. Altogether ok for one or two nights, too expensive for what is offered (37 € for campers + 2 people + electricity). Reservations recommended."

For an AC of 6.7m the turn towards the plots is a little fair as well as for maneuvering but recommended. € 23 per night (2 adults, 1 child and 2 dogs). The girl at the front desk was wonderful, gave us a map and told us to visit."
19037,1582021,2,maikellin,15/09/2021,"The best thing is the attention of the girl. For the rest, the plot is very very small, we could barely maneuver a 7.5m AC on the plot. It would have been better if they had told us not to go. Because we do not enjoy the plot or the site. We ignored the other comments about the plots and we had a bad experience ... You know AC better not ... Attention of the girl of 10."

You can’t park the car right next to the tent on the grass, but the car parks are only a few meters away. The tent spots are shady and close to the amenities, which were clean and spacious! People at the reception are friendly and helpful. It was okay to spend the night but for a longer stay I’d probably pick another place just because of the limited space and privacy of the site."

19045,738643,5,TheBaraonaBus,05/11/2019,Worth the hype! What an amazing spot. Lots of options all up and down this little road. And nice to see that people have been conscientious and not left rubbish or toilet roll everywhere. Let’s keep it that way as it really is a special place! Easy access to lovely Peñiscola too - castle is worth a visit!

19045,736537,4,aido94,02/11/2019,"Good place to stay overnight or even a few nights there are many spots along the dirt track most of the flat ones taken even in early November but we managed. The track ends suddenly and there isn’t much room to turn, don’t go past the beach part if in a super big motorhome. There is a strange dog that hangs around. Don’t feed it. It won’t leave you alone."
19045,735419,4,Renimaniac,01/11/2019,"Generally really great place. Currently but not recommended, because completely overcrowded. In a typical way, typical Germans place chairs and tables in order to reserve seats. This is a public, free place. There does not have to be such behavior, in my opinion. A pity"

19045,546729,5,DeeDeeVendy,10/07/2019,Nice and quiet place. The access is easy. In the evening there were 3 anglers there and about 100m further 2 other campers. Remember to take the garbage with you !!

19045,459114,3,Elsa2,19/04/2019,"The location by the sea is undoubtedly beautiful, but if that is all. It is almost impossible to find a horizontal place, all bushes with privacy are surrounded by piles of pink paper, in case of storm you are shaken tremendously. There really seems to be a lot of pigs among RV drivers."

19045,413886,2,7g7g,13/12/2018,"Beautiful place. It is opposite some homes. So much human excrement everywhere and used toilet roll blowing about. I'm sure the people who do this
would not like others doing it opposite their home. Just take your rubbish and excrement away if you come here. The state of it we deserve to be banned"
19045,413730,5,Spookteam,12/12/2018,"We came again after last year's stay. it is still an awesome spot to spent a few days. But park4night hasn't done the place any good. Too many campers come here now that doesn't have a feel for this place. Is it so hard to bring a bag, a shovel or a porta-potti? In a small place like this. Somebody took a dump on the beach.... If I would live here I wouldn't know how long I would tolerate us here"

in the night there could be movement on the street.
peniscola is very, very touristic"
19045,388201,5,Pedrobono85,05/10/2018,"Excellent location and quiet for the night. You will only hear a humming sound at 5:45 am, not cars but fishing boats leaving the harbor. The sunrise is beautiful and the night view on the Peniscola peninsula magical. Not recommended with young children because too dangerous or permanent monitoring. Ideal for fishermen and bathers with small coves on each side. No garbage cans or toilets nearby."
19045,385795,4,Susi1990,01/10/2018,"Super nice place to reach on gravel, in the dark a bit scary, grade are a bit difficult, many walkers in the morning"
19045,381605,5,nocillastrip,25/09/2018,"Quiet place with spectacular views. Separated from the road, so you will only hear the waves of the sea. One Saturday at the end of September was clean and with 6 or 7 fires scattered on the cliff."
19045,356791,3,MBR,28/08/2018,"Third time we come in two years, and each time it is dirtier. It's sad that such a beautiful place is so dirty. Today we filled two bags of garbage here in Peñíscola, until a couple of old shoes had ... Thanks to all the pigs that do not take care of the environment, the weird thing is that we still have places to enjoy."

Incredible views, lovely sheltered swimming coves, sunrise, sunsets - we’re in love! No sign of local police, lots of other vans scattered along this stretch of rugged coast looking across blue seas towards Peñíscola fort. Keep it clean, don’t use this bushes as toilets and we could have this place forever x"

19045,325803,4,phlhughes,10/08/2018,Great Spot next to the waves awesome views - a little uneven in parts but you can find a flat spot. There are a few other bits you could camp on the same road if the main spot is too busy. Stayed 1 night.

Nice place 10 minutes from the beach where the Peñon de Ifach is. Friendly at reception and the plots in the ""shadow"" of the green mesh is that something really does. With electricity and services included except laundry, very well priced. Highly recommended!."

The problem is a few months of long-term campers from Germany, who clearly show us ""short-term or day tourists"" how undesirable we are. Therefore 3 stars and no recommendation for a short stay, although shops and the beach are very close."

Bike lane and supermarkets next door. The beach 10 minutes. Good place to spend 2 days and get to know Calpe. I do not rate it better, due to the poor cleaning of the WC. Some plots are not very big. Being February, we do not miss the lack of shade."

19058,2289602,3,debbievervoort,23/08/2022,It is a great place for an overnight stay in a tourist hotspot. Comments are the sanitary. If you still have to pay for a place (32 euros for 2 nights) then you do not expect that you have to take your toilet roll with you to the toilet and that you cannot wash your hands with soap because it has run out. Nor is it the pinnacle of hygiene. Because I don't think there's much to clean.

There are many less pretty camper parks in Calpe. The beach and the saltworks are 5mins walk away as well as a mercadona and Aldi. Calpe is not very beautiful despite the Ilfac pynial and the saltworks because everything is distorted by mass tourism and 25-story hotels. Very quiet though with the curfew."

19084,453155,3,Xarifa,12/04/2019,It is NOT allowed to stand behind the restriction signs. Unfortunately some camper colleagues don't respect this. The erosions are a natural monument and not a campground. The local man just informs you and he tells you also that you can stand outside the signs near the street for 48h. There were campers they had to pay 750.- for camping in the forbidden area. The man saves you a lot of money.
19084,453124,4,carlossuperfandango,12/04/2019,As the comment below. The man leaves a police notice but is not the Police. He is a local resident.

Nice playground for the kids. There is also a playground via the path along the campsite. Nice meal at the restaurant. Close to a beautiful beach. We also laughed at the owner and his staff. Sometimes a little Peppie and Kokkie level."

We understand that it is high season and it is a business, but they cannot have you as canned sardines 10 cm, (literal) from the pergola of the next plot because they are not delimited, (the plots).

19130,1455200,1,FraGhi,14/08/2021,"It is a campsite which only has the name. Anarchy due to the lack of delineation of locations: you eat with your neighbor on the right and sleep with the one on the left who has organized his squat all year round and has set up his recycling center one meter from his neighbors.

Otherwise I think it can be a big problem to find a good location. Especially going with wedges, you have outstanding strength. The toilets should be improved a lot, they look very dated and have very little light. The price for a mini camper is € 25.96 / night without light."

The pitches are unfortunately very close to each other and there is no demarcation and you have to hope that the neighbors leave a place. That's why nobody stays long. Why is there only one point? They simply did not clean and clean for a whole week ... You really do not need a campsite anymore.
19130,668769,3,Symba01,30/08/2019,"Very welcome but that's it. A lot of promiscuity (because there are no delimited sites), very limited health. So we only stayed one night."

The bathrooms, despite being somewhat old, are very good, they are always clean and hot showers come out of all the showers. It has areas where water, wash dishes and wash clothes. A night with a car-bed and without electricity cost us about € 26, it was about € 30 if we wanted electricity, but it is possible to get close to the different lampposts in the camping area, which are lit during the night. The terrain is a bit steep, you have to try to find an area as flat as possible. Very attentive and lovely staff."
19130,590939,3,Jamaicablue,01/08/2019,"Quiet, charming, practical family campsite. A bit expensive in season (36 € per night van with electricity, 2 adults 2 children). Indeed the sites are not delimited and are located in a large square of grass, but it suited us. Very practical with children who can run barefoot. Games, charming bar, supermarket. Wifi access only at the reception. The sanitary are the case, at first sight are clean but there is actually mold. Rather 10 min from the beach which is very beautiful."

Very attentive staff and bar that serves good meals. The motorhome area has grass and shadows. The only downside is that the showers were clean but they need new equipment such as light and benches to make it easier with children. Highly recommended

Apparently the same law is different if you go to sleep in a van or get drunk on the beach ... a shame!"
19139,1400773,1,Sheila03,03/08/2021,"7km a bit long to get to the parking lot and that in my opinion is not worth it, land parking with clearance control from 9:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. with risk of a fine .... the most beautiful cove in photos than what it really is..."
19139,1332588,4,fotografa,17/07/2021,"Highly recommended for sleeping and spending the day. The last 6 km are unpaved, but if you go slowly you don't raise a lot of dust. Sleeping next to Plomo beach. There is a path that takes you to the middle cove, you must go early. In the morning the cleaning workers pass around 8:30 to 9. It is preferable that you do not leave it out. Take care of it and leave it better than you find it."
19139,1326527,4,mariiapaal,15/07/2021,"A highly recommended car park, the bad thing is the path to get there (6km along a not very good sandy road). It is a small car park but if you arrive early in the morning or at the end of the afternoon you have a safe place. You spend the night right next to the sea and sleep to the sound of the waves. There is no payment and you can sleep, but there are no fountains or showers."

19209,2153316,5,Gillinger,31/07/2022,"2 adults, car   trailer, electricity -> 57€ for 4 nights.
Sanitaries are clean, everything is alright.
Yes it's a bit dusty, but you're right next to the sandbeach, how else would it be.
Would definitely come back here again, staff is friendly."
19209,2151048,5,anarcotico,31/07/2022,Everything very clean. Good treatment at reception. You can walk to the beach. 2 adults and minivan €8 without electricity. Something old with no frills.
19209,2128970,2,park4portugal22,27/07/2022,Dusty campsite. Plumbing was outdated. Pretty basic. Fine for one night.
19209,2127235,1,Wingmen,26/07/2022,Horrible CP. One star only because of the walking distance to the beach. Short-term campers and long-term campers all thrown together on a hilly gravel plain. Embarrassing for a community CP. Nothing is invested here either. The paramedic facilities > Catastrophe! Only a pipe as a shower and the fittings with at least 4mm lime. The employee who brings you to your parking space grins at you because he would probably never stay here himself. For one night but only in a pinch.
19209,2107722,4,DebbyCtH,22/07/2022,"We are here for the second time. Pay per day about € 10. Including electricity and 2 dogs. The campsite is located in a dune area, so a bit dusty and sometimes a lot of wind. Showers are super hot. It's basic. No unnecessary luxury. Location is perfect. Good range to work with my MeO internet card. They also have an area with free good WiFi. If you want luxury don't come here."
19209,2107697,1,Summerinthecity,22/07/2022,"If you camp cheap, you get cheap! No matter how little you pay, the place is not worth it. Motorhomes staying a few days are assigned a pitch that resembles the surface of the moon: white gravel that is very dusty and pollutes everything. The sanitary facilities are old and partly badly damaged (e.g. in house B6). The location to the beach is good, everything else is scary."
19209,2107379,4,coraline31,22/07/2022,"Excellent value for money: €8.40 with van (Ducato) + 2 people with electricity, crazy stuff. Toilets cleaned regularly, so nickel, direct beach access and not far from the center with bikes. Do not rely on Park 4 nights gps because it sends on a subdivision in fact at the roundabout it is indicated. So you will understand I recommend."
19209,2100154,5,Status6,20/07/2022,"Great place and especially close to the beach. Hard-working employees, the showers and toilets are old, but are constantly being cleaned. Endlessly warm water. Supply and disposal available several times. Electricity and dishwashing no problem. Very cheap for this location! Disadvantage: depending on the wind direction, it can smell like the fish factory (but then it stinks in the whole city)."
19209,2099935,5,charliekgr,20/07/2022,"The price is unbeatable! Unfortunately, I couldn't use any electricity, it requires a specific connection that I didn't have. That's the only deduction. The sanitary facilities were clean, had toilet paper and soap available. There is a mini market with bread rolls. Reception was nice, they could speak english well. About 30 minutes walk to the center, the beach is about 5 to 10 minutes away. I liked it and paid just under €6 for one night (1 person, car + roof tent)"
19209,2084552,3,FloFranck31,17/07/2022,"It helps out a lot when you're in a van. Archaic but not expensive and especially the water in the shower is very hot, what happiness! All services are available"
19209,2066540,5,nduarte,12/07/2022,All facilities needed for a very fair price. 2.55 euro per person + 3.20 euros for the campervan (changes depending on length of vehicle) + 1.50 euro for electricity (if needed). Hot shower and toilets included.

19209,2001859,4,Sabine-100,22/06/2022,"2 people with camper plus dog incl. electricity, V&E under 10€. Everything you need is there. A plus for the really hot showers. Both gates have also been open since mid-June. The place is security monitored. If you don't expect luxury and overly large plots with shade, you will feel fine. The place is simple and sparse, but offers everything you need."
19209,1993022,4,leont266,19/06/2022,"Nothing special but from here you can see Peniche very well. Of course, the sanitary facilities don't look particularly inviting, but for just under €8 per night with 2 people, you can't complain. In addition, the service was very friendly and check-in took about 5 minutes."
19209,1974617,3,Ratapoil69,13/06/2022,"Very large municipal campsite. Pros: Reception Price €7.25 1 person van with electricity. All services. Calm. Fairly spacious pitches. Security. Proximity 15 min walk from the beach. Cons: Outdated sanitary facilities and services. No shade. Depending on the direction of the winds, strong unpleasant odors from the incineration plant."

Check in took a long time. Sanitary facilities old. No toilet paper and no toilet seats. You shouldn't throw toilet paper in the toilet. Good is the proximity to Peniche and Baleal."
19209,1948084,4,BPSSHB,05/06/2022,"We weren’t quite sure what to expect after reading some of the reviews. We found a large no-frills campsite with plenty of slightly dated, but spotlessly clean and working facilities. The campervan area is open gravel with no shade. Staff were friendly & spoke very good English. We were on the summer rate, June-September and paid €9.80 /night for campervan/2 adults/EHU.
Would happily return."
19209,1930709,2,cathdjeff,30/05/2022,Land at low cost. 5.70 euros per night for a two-person van and electricity. The pitches are in full sun and very dusty. The toilets are old. The shower is hot but there is no shower bulb and no hooks to hang things on the men's side. We appreciated the proximity to the bike station.
19209,1923745,3,Jula1324,28/05/2022,"Price-performance fits. However, the exit to the beach is only open from June and the reception is very slow."

Toilets, hot showers, chemical empty.
Great location for Peniche, Supertubos Beach and Baleal Beach.
Friendly staff, no problem booking in. They took your details and copies of passports.
Gated barrier to a large site. We felt very safe, we would definitely come back."
19209,1896116,3,melaniehardman,17/05/2022,"Not bad for a municipal site. Check in needlessly bureaucratic. Does feel like some of the UK sites with lots of permanent fixtures. Very clear, hot water showers included. For the price I can’t complain at all."
19209,1851344,1,Cleddo,24/04/2022,Worst campsite I've ever been to. Cheap yes-sanitary facilities but completely outdated and unusable. Even the women's toilet was full of faeces. Disgusting!
19209,1846913,4,Annanas153,22/04/2022,"€4.30 for one person in a camper with electricity. The place has everything you need. Warm shower and close to the beach. For 1-2 nights great, for a longer vacation I would look for something else."
19209,1843803,5,Cinek,21/04/2022,"I do not understand what happened to the negativ review writers…
We came, could check in straight away, in less than 5 minutes we were done. Possibly as we were here last year, they found us in the system thus she did not had to do photocopying of our ID’s. So fast speed.
2 people incl. electricity cost 11.50 for 2 days."

Worst service I've ever seen, avoid at all costs."
19209,1821585,1,MarikeWerges,14/04/2022,"After an hour of waiting in the check-in line, we left. When we complained that it took too long, the front desk only shouted loudly. Ridiculous."

19209,1786009,1,Kugelporsche,17/03/2022,"Caution! Navi directs you to the old access road with the coordinates! At the roundabout follow the sign for Camping ""Campismo..."". As previously mentioned, the processing at check-in is terrible! The pitches for campers didn't appeal to us either, as everything was narrow and sandy. So we drove on again. The most annoying thing was definitely the unfriendliness of the staff"

It does it very well, there is something different about towns that dont depend on tourists.  Lots of folk come into Peniche on the weekend to eat at the many great restaurants.
Watching the surfers both wind and board is something we never tire of. Thank you Peniche."

The price is just unbeatable. 44 euros for 10 nights. So 4,40 euros a night with electricity. Seems like a mix between surfers from portugal and senior people. Really relaxed atmosphere. And now during low season not so crowded!"

Only on the camper parking, next to the caravans is sand, in which you immediately sink and alone does not come out. Thanks to the super nice Portuguese-speaking staff and nice campers we were able to dig up the tires, which are inferior and pulled out."
19209,429050,3,Joss66,13/02/2019,A rudimentary campsite that justifies its modest price. Beware the price of a laundry spin costs twice as much (8 euros) as the stay (5.60 euros) and the result is shabby due to the obsolescence of equipment. The linen bathed in its juice and the spin nonexistent. But advised all the same since hot shower and clean establishment.

Reception closes at 5.30pm but can check in later. Under 6€ for 2 people, small van with limited electricity/night. We had issues with the electricity as they only allow 4amps and our small van kept tripping the box we Ben though huge campervans next door had everything running. The only reason we weren't wild camping was to charge up the van and charge things so we ended up leaving for the other campsite in town which was a great move."

It is not a quiet place as there is a beach bar next door that closes at 3 and those who want to continue the party do so in the parking lot. It does not have any service which makes people use the WC dunes. To visit the area well, to spend the night even if you can, I do not recommend it. Have a good trip ?"

19234,1437021,3,yerayfueetes,10/08/2021,"Good place, or you arrive early or you arrive at the last minute for sunset, otherwise, you will hardly find a place. Some gorillas took over the parking lot and say give them the will, some make a fuss (those who are sitting drinking liters at the bus stop), others are nice and friendly. THEY ALLOW TO REMOVE CHAIRS AND ALL MATERIAL;) Then there are complaints and tears ..."
19234,1427432,3,Escu,09/08/2021,"Place to spend a night, you have to arrive early in the morning and without problem. a bit noisy at night with people passing by and the road"
19234,1410028,4,MarBarcelo,05/08/2021,"Free parking on the beach, perfect for spending the night. We have been two nights, there is always the odd van! Javi is the guy who guards the parking lot, very kind, we gave him the will! It has a bar in front and a small supermarket! Chiringuito la morena and the route made jets and curtains of fresh water recommended !! Restaurant the social club for lunch or dinner, very good food!"
19234,1390048,3,Sidrina,01/08/2021,One of the few places we saw to spend the night for free in the area. There were many Camper. The bad thing that being near the beach bars there was a lot of noise from people making bottles.
19234,1385163,4,illyapk,31/07/2021,"Super good, we arrived at 11:20 p.m. and even so there was somewhere, there was some atmosphere that to rest not very recommended but hey he was very well"
19234,1370042,4,AlbaaSG,27/07/2021,"Perfect location (just a minute from the beach). There is height control, but right in front there is another unlimited parking (this one is paid). During the day there are gorillas who ask for the will but are quite friendly and receive you with music. You can go with your pet on that beach. At night full of vans and good vibes. I would definitely choose it for the location (next to the beach). No service."
19234,1361324,1,rsonirm,25/07/2021,"Fatal. I don't know how it will be during the week but on Saturday you can't sleep. music all night long, groups of people passing by without stopping, screaming drunk .... come on, a horror at night. better sleep outside"
19234,1351991,1,Irayi,22/07/2021,"We had to leave because a couple of party vans came over. Also one of them parks next door, close together. We went to the beach and when we came back we had a can on top of the bonnet. A shame, because it seemed like a quiet area."
19234,1334863,3,Jou16,18/07/2021,"There are two parts, one is a free dirt parking lot that is fenced with wooden fences, but to enter it is only accessible for vans and cars, since it has a barred door at the entrance and exit that is limited by height. But next to where the bus stop there is another parking area that we saw that there were several motorhomes. You could see movement and people coming out of the bare"
19234,1282242,5,furgofamilysantander,27/06/2021,"Quiet place to be at the foot of the road, parking is limited but we slept right next to a bus stop and we were fine. It does not have a view but it is next to it."
19234,1268765,4,Anamad,21/06/2021,"Very nice place, it has hardly any views of the beach and is next to the road. Still a quiet area with direct access to the beach. It has no services. Although there is a supermarket right across the road. On that beach, at least in June we were able to go down with dogs without problems."
19234,1255898,1,almerix,15/06/2021,They have fenced off practically the entire car park except for the bus stop area where there is space for another ten places? to park vehicles. At the entrance to the car park they have installed two arches to control vehicle clearance without indicating the maximum height ... We have a Ford Transit campervan (considered a tourism vehicle) with services on the roof and it does not fit.
19234,1136014,3,jlccozelui,08/02/2021,"Without services, next to the beach and with a newly installed arch to prevent the entry of motorhomes."
19234,1134860,4,TheDude67,03/02/2021,Stayed here Saturday 30th January with many motorhomes and surfer vans with no worries. However we all got moved on by the Guardia Sunday afternoon. No motorhomes they said.
19234,1130720,4,celine8313,15/01/2021,"A calm night, very close to the seaside."
19234,949231,5,martitarodri22,11/08/2020,We have spent the night without problem. It is next to the beach (there are no views). On the other side of the road there is a cheap parking for AC with entry until 00:00.
19234,945437,4,Beeel,10/08/2020,"Parking very close to the beach where you can park and spend the night (there are gorillas). Small grocery store in front. Safe and unshaded parking. It is not advisable to take out a table and chairs as it is on the ""main"" street and it is very attractive."
19234,937743,1,M.M.R.S.,07/08/2020,"It is on the beachfront, although you cannot see the sea from the parking lot. We only spent an hour with the AC, since the beach is made of stones and you can't even take a bath to cool off. If you are not interested in the beach and what you want is to spend the night, this place will be worth it. Along the road. We do not repeat."
19234,855158,5,LauV,08/07/2020,"I spent two nights there, really great. In the same parking lot there are several gorrillas, super friendly that take care of the van. In front of a small store where you can find food and basics."
19234,850669,3,nhalonso,05/07/2020,"07/03/2020. We were there first during the day, and we paid 1eur to the gorilla. Then we went to Conil but in view of the difficulties we returned and it was late and we could not enter the closed parking in front. Outside we parked more than 10 motorhomes. The Civil Guard passed several times long and nobody was stopped or fined. A little noisy because it is next to the road."
19234,719038,3,Roberts92,11/10/2019,"We were planning on staying the night, but weren’t overly keen on the beach or the parking area. We read previous comments and decided to pay the man that lives on the car park €1, so he didn’t bother us and looked after our van whilst we were on the beach. Unfortunately, he was that drunk he couldn’t remember us giving him money and hassled us for more money, so we left. No services, other than some bins."
19234,714189,3,dacmail,06/10/2019,"In October it is quite full, a parking lot, the surroundings are quite dirty, but to spend the night near the beach it is quiet"
19234,711609,4,jcpascual,03/10/2019,"I was last weekend last September 28 and 29. We were returning from El Palmar and we spent the night there. We arrived around 9 pm there were about 6/7 vans and as many AC. From the same parking lot there is a small path from the beach that is right next door. Very quiet night, all in silence, although it is true that it is at the foot of ctra. In the strong summer months there will be more car chatter ... when we arrived we did not see a gorilla, he arrived at 10.30 and said nothing to us, he was greeting people and it is seen that he knew more than one who spent the night too. .."
19234,647830,1,Marieta,21/08/2019,"At night it is impossible to keep an eye, many party people who use that parking for the beach bars and the road that is continuous traffic."
19234,630628,3,benimarazpeitia,15/08/2019,Beach parking Without services On the side I spend a motorhome that opened at around 12:00 pm the gray waters. If we continue like this they won't let us or take the motorhome out of the garage
19234,576825,2,tesoritos,26/07/2019,I did not see any of the services that the app says. Earth next to the road and point
19234,531393,3,CamperDelfinGaliza,28/06/2019,"We spent two nights and 3 days there. Not bad compared to other spots in the area. The very good location, between the area of the lighthouse of Trafalgar and Los Garitos de los Caños. Javier was not there but if his classmates shared food with them and some coins, very good people, they watch over you and help you with whatever you need."
19234,518699,4,natalu,17/06/2019,"Super pitch, quiet. Opposite there is a mini supermarket. In the parking lot is driving a guy around (so-called Gorrilla) who helps with parking and ""guarded"" the place, for a small pocket money."
19234,462566,5,Guillefur,21/04/2019,"I recommend parking in front of the ""La Marea"" self-service there is a gorrilla called Javier, who gives a couple of euros and looks at the motorhome ... A local Very good person. During the night very quiet during this Easter weekend ... Very beautiful sand, to walk to the lighthouse ..."
19234,433664,4,Hen,25/02/2019,"If it is true that there are gorillas but they seem to be legit, they appeared when we went to park, we gave them one euro and without problems all day and night. yes, a lot of wind ..."
19234,393890,1,jairo,15/10/2018,"We found it an unsafe place, the gorillas were drunk and everyone asked us the voluntud telling us that they do not know each other. We only stopped to eat and they kept coming to bother. When a camper arrived we could see how while one distracted the other I try to take something from inside the van, but could not give the blow. Although for other comments it does not seem usual."
19234,392621,4,meditador,13/10/2018,"Important notice: dodge the center sandbar or you will get stuck. It's a car park, where you pay the will. They seem legit, they live off that parking lot and you have the caravan guarded. Just in front of the beach access walkway, there are no services but opposite there is a well-equipped shop and many beach bars. Highly recommended to park in the area."
19234,385122,1,grangurug,30/09/2018,We arrived to sleep and with them we left. Attached to the main road of the town quite busy and with marauding gorillas. He did not give me any security.
19234,367536,2,R.G.M,08/09/2018,Near food store and beach but not recommended bathroom. There are gorillas. I personally do not like to sleep.
19234,291018,2,Jesus1981,17/07/2018,A bit noisy (cars d road) d d area step night bars
19234,287173,3,topovito,12/07/2018,Good site but I repeat previous comments in which it is alerted that it is easy to get stuck in the sand. A lot of caution!
19234,270527,2,luismiru,18/06/2018,"For the night it is fine ... the beach is made of rocks, do not come to this place if you are looking for a typical sandy beach in the area. There is usually a ""gorrilla"" that asks you ""will""."
19234,256466,4,SaraCliment,21/05/2018,"The place near the beach. It is right next to the road, we do not listen to the cars very much. Directly opposite is a shop where you can buy almost everything and many bars. If you walk towards the pipes you find more things. About 10 min to the town. If you walk along the beach you can reach the trafalgar lighthouse in 15-20 min walking. It is a spectacular place. Perfect for overnight"
19234,245944,1,BabethetFrantz,04/05/2018,"We are currently parked on this space but contrary to what is indicated, there is absolutely no service, it is just a parking lot. Easy access to the beach."
19234,184543,5,RafaCanasveras,25/08/2017,"To spend the perfect night the place, there are usually several vans and motorhomes, nice beach but it is not accessible to bathe."
19234,180259,4,ptovar23,20/08/2017,"Good place to spend the night. It is stuck to the road and you hear some noise, but nothing great. There is a grocery store 50 meters away. Care in the parking k there is an area with sand, in the k cars are clogged and ac."
19234,176222,3,Feemopa91,15/08/2017,"Next to the road, the beach is far away, there are no good views, there are always motorhomes to sleep and some cars do not have many places in pipes ... K we have found"
19234,157883,4,doobya,25/07/2017,"Land parking, not the quietest spot but next to the beach. With a truck and a small tent in high season, the police passed last night and did not even watch. So forbidden to camp ""relative"" :)"
19234,150938,1,javiermaricarmen,13/07/2017,"Camping is forbidden, we all know it, because there are still people who do what they want, then the prohibitions come and we pay for all the behaviors of a few."

19234,127851,3,gramos,15/04/2017,There is a lot of noise x the night x the road and tb music from a nearby bar. The landscape leaves a lot to be desired although the beach is next door
19234,108749,3,laurav,04/10/2016,Next to a road with a super tiny in front of you. the beach is very nice but there are no views from the parking. We were annoyed by the police for unfolding the whole stall but we were two days with tables outside and everything without problems. There were several vans.
19234,99330,5,nitsdellunaplena,24/08/2016,"23.07.2016 We spent the night ourselves and about 15 vans and about 5 motorhomes, great next to a very beautiful beach! We asked the tourist office and they told us that this is where we would sleep best, but that a lady had called to complain just today because a campaign had been parked in front of her house and she had started making fire by blowing it up and it was very dangerous, That's why they told us something, but they went a couple of times in front of the clearing and said nothing. There are no toilets, and it shows on the van when the lift blows!"
19252,2695154,5,Berbel01,25/04/2023,We spent a nice night. No mosquitoes!
19252,2558936,1,Lusalo,23/01/2023,"In these areas they do not fumigate because the mosquito ecosystem keeps the birds, at dawn and dusk the mosquitoes eat you alive, even if you carry repellent, we told our son 40 bites he cried from pain"

19252,137516,1,denisrouy,25/05/2017,No it's very ugly! on previous comments they forgot to mention that this location is in the middle of the 20-storey buildings ...

19262,1075327,5,JuliaRafal,29/09/2020,"Very good site! Especially from September. Many squares, you hear the great beach because they break next to the promenade and at night you see the stars. The only downside: people walk by early in the morning, but normal because the beach is very beautiful!"
19262,1019204,4,IldeChaca,01/09/2020,"It is an excellent place facing the sea. A big drawback, many of those who are here occupy their places for months or at least weeks. Someone should control this. It has very acceptable services. and clean. Several garbage containers. Recommended."

With a large free swimming pool, small shop and homemade rest. It's an amazing place for the price it has, don't come ""tikismikis"" to look at the detail (keep that for first class campsites for €60 a night) because the campsite shows that it's old"

Sanitary correct but dilapidated, clean in the morning after cleaning (rather very used or even dirty for some in the evening). Large salt water swimming pool from 8 am to 8 pm but quite a lot of people and therefore rather dirty at 6 pm! Delimited but small pitch. We were next to a passage, near the toilets so not great at all for us!! Disappointed!"

The owners were very friendly and at the same time demanding, as they ensure the proper functioning of the park and ensure that there is no noise after hours and that the rules are complied with. It has its own restaurant, very good areas, including for tents, and the surrounding area is very beautiful. Highly recommended."

There is no paper and they do not leave it, so take the roll if you're in a hurry. The passage for large motorhomes becomes narrow at times.

Pleasant swimming pool. We did not try the restaurant. Campsite near the city and the coast. Very pleasant to do by bike with beautiful cycle paths. You can take the train to visit Valencia very convenient and inexpensive."

19294,443104,1,colinsp,22/03/2019,A poor site with small pitches with difficult access due to large trees. Toilet blocks are very old and tired and cramped for space. Tedious checkin process to about 30 minutes with inefficient staff. Convenient for Gandia and the port but that is all that is good to say about this site. Bar only open until 12.30pm and so no service in the afternoon or evening. Would not stop there again.
19294,376684,1,Nicocampingcar,18/09/2018,Passing because we returned to France and impossible to fill up water even paying of course. Home very unpleasant damage

We wrote a negative review on tripadvisor that got enough ""likes"" from other users and seeing that this damaged their image contacted tripadvisor to remove the comment. We will never visit this campsite again."

19301,3211311,5,skkn,24/08/2023,a spectacular place..dogs are allowed on half of the beach..there is no garbage so what you bring you take with you..you cannot spend the night..the police pass by often..I don't think about the 8 euros to pay. I have seen it..there is a beach bar (a little expensive)..for those who like birds and nature it is an idyllic place..there is a caravan and camper parking area..in casa de la fusta (infested with mosquitoes )
19301,2721779,5,OpelCamperVivaro,04/05/2023,Amazing place to visit with children
19301,2479483,5,Matthias1208,02/11/2022,Great day parking right on the beach and free of charge in October. There is currently a construction site in the rear area and the path is closed. Overnight stays and camping behavior are prohibited!
19301,2302273,4,somosnomadas,25/08/2022,"Very cool place, although I find it excessive €8 (7 if you buy it online) to have absolutely nothing (not even rubbish bins) People seem to forget that camping is prohibited and some take out awnings etc at their leisure. Then we put our hands in our heads because they don't want us anywhere!"
19301,2246752,3,JOJUSA,16/08/2022,"Perfect for a beach day. In any case, paying 8 euros for the two summer months is a bit excessive. I think that 5 euros is a reasonable price to help preserve the environment."

19301,1649089,3,FrauColumna,17/10/2021,"Beautiful place right on the beach. Ideal to spend the day there. It is forbidden to stay overnight. Unfortunately, the beach is still very busy even in October, so it has the atmosphere of a main thoroughfare."

Let's mention the area !!!, There is also to do paddle surfing, windsurfing, sailing and more ... We will be back !!"
19301,1469148,5,ekinet,17/08/2021,"Paid parking, with an exclusive area for AC, € 8 the whole day, it is not allowed to stay overnight, it is worth spending the whole day and then returning to an area like L'Aldea to sleep"
19301,1400314,5,txetxa1977,03/08/2021,"It had to happen. The irresponsibility of people who spent the night here as a natural park and massively massed the area in a wild way means that in the end they make these payment areas. The parking lot is perfect to spend the day at the beach. And to sleep in authorized areas, which is a NATURAL PARK"
19301,1292885,1,ria_brava,03/07/2021,Mossos control before arriving ... if you want to spend it is 8 euros although they have enabled a free area in another area of the beach ... a shame they put such cool places as payment

19301,1281308,5,FuberPS,27/06/2021,"A perfect place to watch the sunset. The latest floods have shortened the beach of the trabucador. Still a great place to spend a night. It is true that at the beginning there was a signal, but we saw about 20 parked campers and we decided to spend the night. The guard passed at 9am and they told us nothing."
19301,1270285,5,alitos,22/06/2021,Wonderful place to spend a day at the beach. You can't sleep and watch out for the sand. Before arriving you can see flamingos
19301,1154336,5,albert91,20/03/2021,Good parking to leave the motorhome and take a walk with the dog. On one side there is a rougher beach and on the other a quieter one.
19301,1098145,4,parkcarla,18/10/2020,"Good place to spend the day and night, although last night we were and there were cars with music until 00:00 approx. Then great, the floor is beach sand and if it is damp it stains a lot when entering the van."
19301,1061844,5,Jordi_Dolors,21/09/2020,"Ideal to spend the day, it is good that they do not let you spend the night, there are other places very close to do so, so keep it clean."
19301,1044853,5,sabesalreves,13/09/2020,"Assuming it is prohibited, the number of people staying overnight even with the advance installed. makes you question how many times they happen to control. I think it is necessary to have a legal area to stay overnight since the site is incredible."
19301,930673,5,elenanus,05/08/2020,"Amazing place. Very comfortable and quiet. The place is great to go with children because of the shallow water and also with dogs to play without having to swim. We prefer not to sleep here as there are several signs that prohibit it. Also at the time the sun sets, mosquitoes arrive and not just a few. Highly highly recommended, yes, let's keep it clean! When we went we were amazed that there was no garbage and so the spaces are much more enjoyed."

19301,863725,5,Trail4Life,12/07/2020,We spent the night here without any problems. The only downside is that mosquitoes eat you night and morning.
19301,713887,5,Ninachibb,05/10/2019,"Wide site, spectacular natural and wild sunset, without services. After sunset the mosquitoes kill you, unbearable, unfit Xa irritable people."
19301,696914,4,roland07,19/09/2019,Super spot. 2 nights near the beach bar. A bit noisy because the bar group operates from 11h to 20h30. The bar closes at the end of September.

19301,66173,5,furgofante,24/03/2016,"Spectacular place with fantastic views and environment, the only problem is the elements of skate surfing or what are called the kites that are believed by the owners of the place and bother them all, that you walk through there and aorques with their ropes, that your dog this in the water .... Etc, but a little below there are fantastical corners"

19343,3269377,3,lucai,07/09/2023,"I want to tell everyone to park their vehicles properly, it is very important since the uncivil, poorly educated people who only think about themselves, eat up the space where 8 in a battery fit, 3 in a row. Please give more consideration, it is an area, so it's okay to occupy part of the steel, they allow us to do so, as seen in the photo in this publication."
19343,3210322,2,Sarimar2023,24/08/2023,"The parking space is centrally located and safe. Next door is a supermarket. Unfortunately, the supply and disposal did not work well at all, so that we could only drain gray water, a pity!"
19343,3196932,2,kdeslandes,22/08/2023,"The water service is not in a very good condition and is hard to find. Shame since the town is famous for its aqueduc and access to water. Consider this space for parking only. Gets very busy, like a sardine box. Only handy because it’s nice distance to the center of the city."
19343,3196486,2,Enrique76,21/08/2023,I share the comment of the partner. It is very close to the city and the municipal swimming pool. Nothing else.
19343,3184643,4,MarcoPVaz,20/08/2023,"I didn't stay overnight because there was a fair the next day, and also because I found the places inclined and short. Note that the faucet is screw-on and is 1 inch."
19343,3178185,3,cletusRodante,19/08/2023,"The only thing that is worth it is that it is close to the center. About 15 min from the aqueduct. For the rest it is a parking lot that they have “enabled”. It is uneven and on Saturday at 7 you have to leave because they put on the market. And at six o'clock the merchants are already there giving up their ass, setting up their shops and giving you dirty looks. I think Segovia deserves a dignified ares even on weekends."
19343,3164919,3,LARANDONVOYAGE,17/08/2023,"For me it is a parking lot with uneven services everywhere because it is not made as an area. It is a piece of parking that has been set up for motorhomes. At 8 in the morning, the blower passes to clean the leaves just behind the bullring. 15 min. walking to the beautiful city center the impomentw aqueduct"
19343,3153323,4,octaAltabert,15/08/2023,"Good parking to visit Segovia, there are all the services, we have only spent the day, we have not spent the night, from time to time the national police pass by, they do not say anything, many wear shoes and do not tell them anything, little inclination, we has liked."

19343,3130265,3,Astigi,12/08/2023,"Located right next to the bullring. About 10 minutes walk from the center. Free water services, although the keys are in a chest on the ground and are overflowing with water, having to put your hands in the water that remains accumulated. A city like Segovia deserves something different, it doesn't cost as much to have taps on the wall as on the all the sites and it would be a 5 star area"
19343,3118888,5,nancy933,11/08/2023,Nice and quiet place came to sleep here for 1 night with a converted Ford Transit.
19343,3118773,3,maite14,10/08/2023,"The parking is close to the center to visit Segovia on foot. However, it is not level and it is difficult to find a smooth square. On the other hand, several cars passed at high speed."

19343,3061333,5,Natheriu15,02/08/2023,We have spent a very good night with many motorhomes and vans. To repeat. We have not used the services.

19343,3044257,3,Josecar,30/07/2023,"Seats somewhat uneven. The filling of water and rinsing of poty is complicated, on the ground, in a flooded chest. However, it is a short walk from the center, and we slept very soundly. Close to a supermarket and parks."
19343,3044047,2,Canarias_Viaja,30/07/2023,"Very narrow and short sites for more than 6 meters, even to maneuver. You have to mount the rear on the sidewalk. Impossible to use the services because the taps were broken for quite some time."
19343,3041499,4,AntonioJLuque,29/07/2023,"Good location close to the aqueduct, we didn't even see the services since we went on a Friday night and since there is a market on Saturday they kicked us out before 6:30. it is noisy to sleep and few shadows, if you are passing through to visit the city it is not bad"
19343,3040986,2,LoreyKike,29/07/2023,"Close to the center depending on how you look at it, it's a good walk. Next door is a gas station with Opencor and a self-service laundry. We called the local police to inform us and you must park in battery whatever the size of the AC, those with more than 6m protrude. Be careful, not a shadow! Narrow places. It has a service for emptying blacks into a sewer and filling them, but they cannot be used."
19343,3011761,3,alair13,24/07/2023,"Convenient area for sightseeing, but no shade, all places with side slope. Until 2 in the morning voices and cries of local stragglers in the nearby park, then very quiet. Difficult camper service, short pitch with trees and the water taps in the drains next to the drain leak and the drains are full of water and earth."
19343,2997735,5,Jesusfq8,21/07/2023,"good place to park and even spend the night. Uneven site, but it will only be necessary to fit two wheels and perfect. quiet place. on Saturdays from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. you will not be able to be there, due to the market"
19343,2984903,2,van_BG,18/07/2023,"large parking with area reserved for campers, motorhomes (not suitable for very big vehicles). Free, authorised overnight parking, feels safe. 
Not completely flat but yellow blocks to level the vehicle are allowed.  Lots of cars passing by. Not much shade,  quite hot day and night.
Clean water is provided via a manhole, which is flooded... not possible to load water!"
19343,2982279,3,RaquelGamez,18/07/2023,It has a broken water intake and needs the one inch intake. But there are two intakes and a water drain. There is not much noise. Near the old town and the aqueduct. Recommended
19343,2981486,4,BiziBidaia,18/07/2023,Good place to visit Segovia. there is no service and the squares are inclined. On Saturday mornings there is a market and vehicles cannot be parked in those squares.
19343,2980837,4,lospocas,18/07/2023,"We stayed for one night and it was very good, comfortable seats, a little inclination but in the correct orientation, you won't even notice, very central, the police come by often. (This goes to the competent authorities) There is a park next door and last night a car with 5 people came around 1:00, they parked, they went to the park with a bottle and shouting, impossible to rest, please try to remedy it, thank you."
19343,2942538,3,jacou,09/07/2023,"The location of the area is good in relation to the tourist area, 20 minutes on foot to reach the aqueduct, on the other hand, pitches with double slopes, length limit for a 6.35m with bike rack, very narrow width, water and drainage very fair. !Saturday is the market, available after 5:00 p.m., this place is also used for other occasions!"
19343,2914160,5,Fco.Aparicio,02/07/2023,"Good area, due to its location, due to its proximity to supermarkets and gas stations. Services such as clean water filling are somewhat uncomfortable. And the worst thing is not being able to park on Saturday morning. 15 minutes from the center of the town, which by the way is wonderful."
19343,2906874,2,josebusangel,30/06/2023,"An area with very uncomfortable services for a city like Segovia. If your motorhome measures more than 7 m, it protrudes from the square and you will have a hard time getting in and out of the square if there are parked in front. In the middle of a heat wave these days, with little shade. Even so, it is a 15-minute walk to the center next to the aqueduct, the city is beautiful"
19343,2885605,4,zucche,24/06/2023,"Very nice area, right next to the center of Segovia. Free services! The area allows you to open windows and place calzos, as the vacancies have a little inclination. The only bad thing is the service faucets that have a huge nozzle. Gray water from a bottle next to the WC. 5G Vodafone to work perfect!"

19343,2865808,3,LupinIII,18/06/2023,Great rest area near downtown. Camper service not very functional. From 16 to 18 June 2023 closed for events.
19343,2858627,3,camperandoforte,16/06/2023,Not a bad parking but the services are not functional at all: fountain hidden in a manhole and it is not clear how to discharge the gray water. From 16 to 18 June 2023 the area is not accessible due to some event.
19343,2844653,4,Tamlac,11/06/2023,"very practical area for visiting the city, services difficult to access and pitches on slopes, but despite everything it is free and well placed, we spent 2 nights there and frankly well, a little noise on Saturday morning because the traders are setting up. It is very rare to find pitches for free motorhomes in the town centre. Thanks to the city."
19343,2842987,4,sabine1968,11/06/2023,Area very well located 10 minutes from the aqueduct. Broken and unusable water loading service. Very noisy in the morning with locals talking from 7am and noisy at night. But great for visiting the city
19343,2842423,3,patetmarie85,11/06/2023,Area very well located 10 minutes walk from the historic center. We did not use the inconvenient services. Slope
19343,2838126,4,sportti,10/06/2023,"Quiet night even if all the motorhomes have retreated to the car park from Friday afternoon, because Saturday is market day."
19343,2823758,4,pepeCarral,05/06/2023,"Ideal to visit the City and spend the night,"
19343,2806082,4,CarolinaCoelho,31/05/2023,Service Area for Motorhomes very well located to visit the city of Segovia. Free water service (ash and black loading and unloading).
19343,2798963,4,tiburon,29/05/2023,"On the weekend of June 1-4 the area will be occupied by a car fair. There are several places in Segovia to park and a loading and unloading area in La Lastrilla, which is within the capital of Segovia."
19343,2772048,3,Kasku51,21/05/2023,"A city as wonderful as Segovia deserves a real area and every day. Not being able to use it on the weekend is losing travelers. The squares are very short (with 7.5 meters you stand out in front and sticking your ass out to another square behind). They have lateral and frontal unevenness. The positive part is the location, in the heart of the city and very close to the aqueduct and the old town."
19343,2760167,4,maulan64,18/05/2023,"When we arrived there was 1 spot left. Other CCs got into the next sloping parking lot. We spent the night there, it was quiet. Well placed for visiting the city, the aqueduct is 20 minutes away on foot and the cathedral 30 minutes away. I did not use the services of the area."
19343,2758518,1,Retril,18/05/2023,"We were last weekend and we had not found out about the market. At five in the morning the cleaners arrived to place garbage containers and immediately afterward fruit trucks began to arrive, the noise made it impossible to sleep, we started the car and left there. I do not understand if it is an area for cars that a market paints there. Never to return."
19343,2753719,4,vicentelopez,16/05/2023,the. parking lots are better than the other area
19343,2742318,2,MC4333,11/05/2023,All squares have some inclination. The emptying area occupied by a car. The best thing is that it is in the middle of the city and it is perfect for visiting Segovia.
19343,2738426,2,3260bnm,10/05/2023,"The clean water intake is under a chest and submerged in the water that comes out, it is difficult to connect with a record. It is seen that the person who designed it has little idea that it would have cost little to place a faucet outside as is normal"
19343,2735263,4,Kareel,08/05/2023,"A good place to discover the beautiful city, but very noisy at night with young people driving around."
19343,2711503,3,jonma,30/04/2023,"There are many squares but most of them are inclined and you have to use wedges. They are battery parking lots that are a little short for most motorhomes, although they do not affect passage. It is 15-20 minutes from the center"
19343,2708725,3,iolearmani,30/04/2023,"rest area near the center. very convenient both for a visit to the city and for spending the night. it is located behind the bullring. pity about the services, the drain manholes are clogged. anyway thanks to the mutual friend of campers."
19343,2690182,3,gioia51,23/04/2023,"Area with very small spaces, services, dilapidated, Saturday market so free the parking lot by seven in the morning. We have stopped only to visit the city, which I think deserves a larger area for the beautiful city. It's all free, you can't ask for more"
19343,2666677,4,Aniatxu,13/04/2023,"Quiet site. We spent one night there and everything was great, quite silent. Not far from the city center. A little uneven, we parked a little uphill"
19343,2665011,5,Purvess,12/04/2023,Great place to stay to see the town. Lots of vans here all day even in April but plenty of space to go round. A bit sloping ay the top but fine at the bottom. tank emptying place is at the bottom of the hill. Stayed here for 2 nights and no problems.
19343,2660529,2,SonyGasteiz,11/04/2023,We have spent two nights during the week. Good. The spaces are short and the vehicle stands out in addition to being on a slope. In the city. 30 long minutes to the Alcázar.
19343,2656203,4,juancosta,10/04/2023,"We spent one night during Holy Week. The only cons: the higher places are very inclined and the vehicles are very close once parked. The rest all ok, there is water discharge of gray and black water."
19343,2650840,3,Henrrubi,08/04/2023,"You can spend the night without problems, but there is a lot of lateral inclination, important wedges. We arrived in the early afternoon and it was practically full. Little space between vehicles."
19343,2648834,4,JuanySonia,08/04/2023,"A little inclined, the squares very short. Close to the center. It is large but difficult to find parking, due to the number of motorhomes and many cars parked without respecting the area and its end."
19343,2648457,4,LosCano,08/04/2023,We parked to see the city but did not spend the night. Thanks to the town hall for this space.
19343,2647172,4,TerryChoco,07/04/2023,"Correct area and very well located. The use of chocks is almost forced due to the unevenness, but apparently they are permissive at this point. Minimal but sufficient services for civilized people. Saturdays disabled by flea market. Thank the town hall for presenting these services and for free. We hope that other town halls with more capacity will follow this example. Thank you Segovia!"
19343,2645905,3,Xocasmadeira,07/04/2023,"minimal services. abundant spaces. at 7 in the morning two buses appear to pick up a very noisy crowd, a pity."
19343,2642499,4,cferna17,05/04/2023,It was full but the places that are not reserved for motorhomes are occupied apparently without a problem. The squares above are quite inclined
19343,2641479,4,luisarubia,05/04/2023,"area near the center, with plenty of parking space, quiet night."
19343,2641073,4,Mariike,05/04/2023,"It's a luxury to have a place like this so close to the center! Many thanks to Segovia for having done it ❤️ we had a very quiet night. It was quite crowded but there were plenty of places. On the other hand, shims are needed"
19343,2635593,4,Marinasantoro4,02/04/2023,"Very spacious place with place for many caravans and close to the center. Comfortable to sleep, illuminated and quiet. The only con is that the service area is quite uncomfortable. The gray and black drain is next to the entrance sign, very poorly marked and it is difficult to accommodate the vehicle to use it. As for the water tap, we have gotten soaked trying to use it."
19343,2625486,3,rafagonzalo,26/03/2023,"Thanks to Segovia for the free area first. Seats with lateral inclination although they allow chocks. illuminated. As points of improvement, I would point out a larger gray emptying grid located longitudinally in the service area and the water intakes on mochetes and not on the ground as they are currently and which are full of water with what gives ""thing"" to connect your hose."
19343,2621347,3,jcsgalvez,23/03/2023,"The best thing is the location, which allows you to reach the centers of interest on foot. It also has the bus stop number 5 very close. The area is very quiet and well lit. The worst: very difficult emptying and filling. In these days (end of March) it was saturated. In any case, we thank the Segovia City Council for this initiative."
19343,2620995,4,AndrzejHankiewicz,23/03/2023,"I was twice. Quiet parking lot, often visited by the police. Absolutely recommendable for an overnight stay and requiring some gymnastics with the service. bi"
19343,2616318,5,Rarias20,19/03/2023,"Free very very quiet area, ideal for overnight stays, it is true that it is a bit uneven but they allow you to put chocks on and you have to leave the area on Saturday but you can stay in the parking lot next door without problem until they reopen (5:00 p.m.) . It has all the free services, a DIA and a gas station 100m walk away and the center 1.5km walk away. Thank you Segovia for the area."
19343,2610276,4,cabrerav6,15/03/2023,"Fair parking for motorhomes, uneven although it is not bad, to enter the supply area if the opposite space is occupied you have to do many maneuvers to enter straight, the water intake to connect the hose is not standard, it is one or 2 measures older, very close to the aqueduct and a day supermarket and meals at home"
19343,2604619,5,RosayJorge,10/03/2023,Very good and quiet area! Thank you Segovia!
19343,2595460,3,yapagare,01/03/2023,"Although far from the center, I think it is the best option to visit Segovia by Camper van or motorhome."
19343,2592942,3,KentoViajero,27/02/2023,"Many parking spaces, but short for motorhomes of 7 meters. Although it is inclined, you can sleep. Disadvantages: there are no garbage cans. Very close to the beginning of the aqueduct."
19343,2587324,1,salitre.deriva,22/02/2023,"Small emptying area. We with 7 meters occupied half the road. On Saturday at 7 they put on the weekly market. Come on, how impossible to sleep a weekend there. It's ok to park, and visit the city. I recommend spending the night in La Granja, 11km away"
19343,2586915,5,Inestosi,22/02/2023,Very good place to visit Segovia. Water and sewage available. The police often patrol.
19343,2586368,2,rossellapozzessere,21/02/2023,"To refill the water we had to open a manhole on the ground where the tap was immersed in water, simply indecent and unhygienic. I don't understand how you can make a camper area and not equip it with a normal tap. Also while we were loading water, it was raining and therefore very uncomfortable. The cistern drain is next to it but it is not equipped with a normal tap either."
19343,2584728,5,flabro,20/02/2023,"On 20 02 2023, the services (clean water and emptying of gray and black water) are accessible free of charge. The system is quite rudimentary but works perfectly. Do not handle the water tap without first connecting a hose for filling because the pressure is strong and you risk taking a mega shower of cold water."
19343,2581990,5,theothermartin,18/02/2023,Water taps are under a manhole cover so only accessible with a hose. The bays are short so you have to park sideways reducing the capacity to 6. on Friday night youngsters were speeding around the car park until 1am. Disappointing.
19343,2567317,5,Gromo,03/02/2023,Great free parking in a good location. Aqueduct within a few minutes walking distance. Perfect for a city tour.
19343,2555084,4,mjj81,18/01/2023,Location which has the merit of existing and of not being far from the monuments. Thank you to the municipality because there are quite few of this type in Spain
19343,2550701,5,astpark,13/01/2023,Close to everything. Popular site as there were at least ten other MH there. Thanks to the council.
19343,2549721,4,distritocamper,12/01/2023,"Perfect for visiting the city. A 10-minute walk from the aqueduct and 27 minutes from the Alcazar of Segovia. The plots are somewhat inclined, but you sleep well. On the way we saw an Aldi and we took the opportunity to buy since we did not see other supermarkets near the area."
19343,2542042,5,XuanAlonso,05/01/2023,"It is a very nice and quiet area next to the Segovia bullring, ten minutes from the aqueduct, there are many places to visit the Aqueduct, the Cathedral and the Alcázar. It has very good gastronomy, especially the Segovian soup and suckling pig."
19343,2540553,2,immafovi,04/01/2023,Fairly large area with a slope. Wedges are required. Very close to a supermarket. At night there were car races and shouts of young people at 50m. They can empty black water and take clean water. The clean water faucet inconvenient to use.
19343,2540442,5,adorausch,03/01/2023,"Great location, safe feeling because of the many caravans, aqueduct can be reached in a few minutes. Thank you Segovia!"
19343,2538900,4,joanjo,02/01/2023,"Well located area, ideal for visiting the city. The only flaw is that the hose rush is below ground level and covered in stagnant water (we found it unhygienic)."
19343,2537247,4,PADI67,01/01/2023,very good place to spend the night and do tourism in Segovia.
19343,2537200,4,JRM64,01/01/2023,Area near the Center. Wide squares and quite level. I don't give it 5 stars because the area for emptying and filling with water is somewhat complicated. For the rest fine. Thank the Segovia City Council for thinking of our group.
19343,2534627,4,Fransus,30/12/2022,"We stop only during the day to empty out and visit Segovia. Good place to park, no more than 15 minutes from the center. The squares are somewhat inclined to sleep, but I have slept in worse places. I have not seen the possibility of loading."
19343,2529990,4,Furgo_time,27/12/2022,"Uneven, quiet area. Near the city. Be careful, one day a week they put on a market and you can't park."
19343,2521944,4,molly95,15/12/2022,Wonderful city really worth a visit. Services ok even if they’re underwater. Sloping but still ok
19343,2519863,3,remolinoxp,11/12/2022,Quite good to visit Segovia the worst places are very short with a 7m car you go just
19343,2515602,3,JavierMajuelo,07/12/2022,"Good parking. 20 min from the aqueduct. In the unloading area, they had to indicate it so that no one would park. Right now there is a camper and it cannot be used. The town hall's fault that the square is not marked as a discharge area. Otherwise well."
19343,2515178,3,MarisaCP,07/12/2022,We slept peacefully and a short walk from the center but very impractical services to use and if you go on a weekend it is no longer worth it because there is a market on Saturdays and you can no longer park.
19343,2514978,3,JJALM,07/12/2022,"Great for visiting the city with free water filling and emptying service, the only bad thing is the parking spaces, all of them inclined from less to more."
19343,2514450,4,Bedorc,06/12/2022,"Quiet and free area about 15 minutes walk from the center. Emptying service. Inclined squares, shims are needed."
19343,2514341,4,maraguila,06/12/2022,"Afternoon and quiet night, nice walk to the center next to the aqueduct. Inclined squares, as we saw that everyone had shims, we put them. The emptying area was occupied by a parked motorhome that we could not empty. Good to visit the city. Thanks to the town hall."
19343,2514244,4,Javideldel,06/12/2022,"The location is very good. You can get to the center by walking along the aqueduct while you see it grow. The negative point is that the water intakes are under a cover on the ground. Apart from the discomfort, since it had rained, they were flooded and you have to put your hands in the puddle to connect. And one of the 2 sockets was broken. The area is quiet and next to a Dia and a gas station."
19343,2514120,3,bella6644,06/12/2022,"Parking shared with cars. A little complicated to park with a 7.50 m. But it is possible, but very narrow and sloping impossible to put wedges with this size. Otherwise free emptying and filling, not far from the historic center on foot (20 mins). It still has the merit of existing so we are satisfied with it. We spent one night there, it's quiet."
19343,2493961,3,Harvey2016,13/11/2022,"A quiet night, ten minutes from the start of the viaduct. Lovely town well worth visiting with a massive Cathedral well worth the 3 euros entry. Services could do with modernising."
19343,2491340,4,Carlos.Bicca,11/11/2022,Beautiful city! Worth the visit. The support place is very good for a one night stay. Access to services could improve.
19343,2491201,5,duca28,11/11/2022,"Magnificent area, very quiet and 10 minutes from the center, a day supermarket 2 minutes away, good views of the bullring and very close to where the aqueduct begins, on Saturdays, the Peron market can spend the night in the parking lot next door"
19343,2476593,3,Renaultxgo,01/11/2022,"Perfect location, right at the beginning of the aqueduct. Uneven terrain and very poor filling and emptying service is in some sewers that you can't even see... low noise area except for the colleagues who get up early and have no respect for those who are still asleep."
19343,2454689,4,Atoarredondo,21/10/2022,thanks to the town hall very good silent area the only downside is the filling and emptying is very bad
19343,2452165,4,TirzavdB,19/10/2022,"a great place for a quiet overnight stay. Unfortunately we could not fill our water because we have a separate water tank without a hose, so that is good to know."
19343,2443052,5,carbajal,14/10/2022,"Area with a bit of unevenness, 1500 meters from the aqueduct, there is bus stop No. 5, in front of the funeral home, near the DIA, the last stop is in the center to visit everything. Be careful on Saturdays that there is a market and it is prohibited from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. We have been very calm. Thanks for the area."
19343,2400535,1,Natividadavalo,24/09/2022,"I do not recommend it, young people gather for parties, as it is Right next to the bullring there are events and concerts. We went to another place and it was very good."
19343,2379496,3,andreasg10,17/09/2022,"We slept the night from Friday to Saturday, we parked in the parking lot next to the AC area since on Saturday there is a market at 7 in the morning. It is somewhat inclined and there are frequent passing and noise-making cars. But you can sleep well. 15 mins walk from the aqueduct."
19343,2375725,3,MSmifffy,16/09/2022,"Great for access to the city, but otherwise this is just a carpark. 
Fresh water and grey water disposal available, albeit not easy to find (check the photos!).
Lots of traffic noise in the morning."
19343,2375202,4,paquito,15/09/2022,"We spent a quiet night there on 14/09. Convenient for visiting the city. Near the area there is a Dia supermarket and a petrol station. It's a pity that the Ccars and Vans park as they want without respecting the markings on the ground, which reduces the number of places available..."
19343,2365323,4,dodderinginadefender,12/09/2022,"Noisy at night, campers coming and going, road and general goings on, but great stop to walk 24 mins via the amazing aqueduct to old town which is lovely.has grey and black water emptying and plenty of parking for all sizes"
19343,2362414,4,tarracosirius,11/09/2022,"We slept one night. It is fine, calm, a little inclined, but nothing important and close to the aqueduct. Thanks to the city"
19343,2362024,4,choricita,11/09/2022,quite well with services Saturday night super quiet thanks
19343,2361926,3,javier19929,11/09/2022,"Good place to park and spend the night. It has water services, gray water and black water. Two important things to keep in mind, on Saturdays there is a market and you have to remove the vehicle, and the second is that the gray water discharge site is not level and the tank may not be discharged properly"
19343,2361307,4,trastorno,11/09/2022,"Good area. We slept very well and peacefully for two nights. Good for loading and unloading water. Be careful on Saturdays, there is a market and you have to remove the motorhomes. 10 minutes from the center of Segovia. Thanks to Segovia for this area."
19343,2361121,3,FrankMar10,11/09/2022,"10/09/2022 normal market until 5 p.m., perhaps not taking place due to the arrival of women at the Vuelta. Cover for cassette and gray water discharge into sewer cover, difficult to aim correctly. Free and quiet, center and aqueduct at 30' walking distance."
19343,2353861,3,rafaydana,09/09/2022,"Parking adapted for motorhomes, in an area shared with cars. Impractical services. The existence of containers for recycling is missing. A world heritage city deserves more. However thanks to the municipality."
19343,2306956,5,livespain,26/08/2022,"good area, it is well located 15 minutes from the center, the filling of water and emptying, are metal covers that are on the ground, where the lines of the sidewalks are painted yellow. it is hardly visible. On Saturday there is a market, and you have to move the motorhome and park it in the parking lots a little higher, there is a difference in level, but we go with a couple of chocks solved."
19343,2263843,5,RamFerTo,18/08/2022,"We have spent 2 wonderful nights. Parking with a slight slope, emptying and filling services working, and a super quiet area. A 35-minute walk from the Alcázar and about 20-25 from the aqueduct. It would be advisable for us, the users, to make good use of the water intakes and not leave them flooded for those who come after us (Wednesday afternoon it was dry and today morning it was full of water)."
19343,2236168,4,JuliaViajera,14/08/2022,Saturday night very quiet and with surveillance. Very good location to visit the city and with the necessary services. A certain unevenness in some squares... there are many more than 20 and they did not charge us anything.
19343,2208490,4,joshi_es,10/08/2022,"Very quiet area. We have spent the night. 15 minutes from downtown walking. Filling and emptying services very poor and poorly indicated. But to spend the night and visit Segovia, it has gone well for us."
19343,2199832,5,sonipa,08/08/2022,Thank you for this service to be able to visit this beautiful city !! I wish there were more cities like this!
19343,2165406,4,bimbaraner,03/08/2022,"Good place to spend the night or park and be able to visit such a beautiful city. We do not put five stars because of the inclination and because on Saturdays we have to go out at 7 for the weekly market. By the way, in the David Guijarro Restaurant we have been able to taste a typical Segovian menu with our three dogs in the dining room: Beans from the Farm and suckling pig. Congratulations for accepting pets!!"
19343,2139354,4,Hectorardura,29/07/2022,Good place for vans and AC to park and spend the night. Slightly tilted. Very quiet area. 1 minute away is the Don Piripi bar-restaurant where you can have a coffee and a good tortilla pincho. Recommended place.
19343,2132199,4,FranGarrido,27/07/2022,Excellent place as a base camp to walk to the historic center of the City. An important warning is that you must have a one-inch hose adapter to be able to connect to the water intakes in the Motorhome area. Without the one-inch adapter it will be difficult for you to replenish water in this area
19343,2041425,4,crigbee1,05/07/2022,Super place to park with water and drains. We planned to stay the night but arriving back at 7pm it was still 32 degrees. As bbq’s and the removal of anything from your vehicle (chairs) we decided not to stay as did not want to sit in the campervan. At another time of year this would be fine.
19343,2030879,4,molly2015,02/07/2022,Good free stop. Easy 5 or 11 bus at the top of the road 1€ right into the aqueduct. Black water under the lift up plate is a bit basic but works. Water under the blue lift up plate. A quiet night great facility.

19343,1976360,4,jorgealeman,14/06/2022,excellent location! services only have to be leveled but in general very good!

19343,1947491,2,ang3lj25,05/06/2022,"To park and go to the center it is perfect, it is 10 minutes from the aqueduct. Bus lines 9 and 11 that stop next to the bullring. It does not have an emptying and filling area, or at least, we did not find it. We're new to this but we didn't see it. Small car parks and if you are lucky and find a place where there are no trees, well, if not you will have to park longitudinally and with a drop."
19343,1940555,1,marion.zuko,02/06/2022,"parking near the center, a little sloping but not at all disturbing, on the other hand no service at all, emptying, water nothing at all, a lot of cars circulating in the evening so one night but no more."
19343,1928268,4,didougisou,29/05/2022,"Very well located area. We slept there after visiting the city during the day until nightfall, to enjoy the magnificent lighting of the aqueduct and the flight of swallows. The area was more than full in the evening but very quiet. Safe. Did not use the services that have the merit of existing but very basic. Difficult to find under ""looks"" (color plates)"
19343,1921610,4,frannetpat,27/05/2022,Area very close to the beautiful historic center. Quiet at night.
19343,1915686,3,estelle.nadine,25/05/2022,"Parking very well located to visit Segovia. As for the services, it really sucks. We went to the other service area for this. It is new and very clean. It is 4 km away, so far from the historic center, but you don't hesitate to do your business."
19343,1907268,3,raulillo,22/05/2022,"10 minutes from the aqueduct, quiet night accompanied by enough AC, the only thing that is not very level."
19343,1898361,4,Alegoncalves,18/05/2022,we spent a very peaceful night. The look of the bullring is very beautiful...it has services.
19343,1890749,3,Burgaillo,15/05/2022,"Sometimes I wonder who they ask to make areas like these, totally uneven and we don't know how to park because if you do it online you waste space and in battery you get on the sidewalks. Away from the center and as something positive you can change the water and empty it. In short, with a little more common sense they leave it fine, but it is easy to take advantage of parking lots and put up an ""area"" sign"
19343,1879541,3,soapyf,09/05/2022,"Very convenient for the aquaduct and town but small spaces. Any large unit will need to overhang the path and several trees dictate the length of the pitch. For a tourist town such as this the services are poor, fresh water supply is submerged so not useable, black water straight into sewer with no rinse facility. ok to park in car park if full."
19343,1875388,1,zulzul,07/05/2022,"a pity Very poor services difficult to use. We had to park in the upper part of the parking lot because it is prohibited in the motorhome area on Saturday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. In the upper area there is a lot of unevenness. On Saturday at noon a concert in the bullring, the entire parking lot full of cars having a drink... In short, our experience has been disastrous"

19343,1857724,2,E.M.A.A.,28/04/2022,"Small inclined squares, you protrude towards the sidewalk, or towards the road because there are trees that do not allow you to go backwards. The somewhat ""shabby"" services are sewers, uncomfortable. We have not been able to load water because none of the plugs that we have are working (it had never happened to us), nor to empty greys, on the sign it says that the sewer cannot be used, and there is no more place for it."
19343,1845061,3,viajamos,22/04/2022,"I arrived yesterday, Thursday, and I didn't stay the night because they set up a market on Fridays at 7:00. The situation is good for visiting the city and the squares are a new area. A city like it is should have something more suitable for our needs."

19343,1834488,4,sara05ra,18/04/2022,"We spent one night on 04/14, a very good location to go to the city center, a 10-minute walk. There are many places with quite a difference in level, but others are very good. The only thing that is very acceptable is the gray water emptying area."
19343,1830290,4,MiguelHidalgo,17/04/2022,"4 stars because it is better than not having an area in the municipality. Non-level area, emptying and filling service, 15 minutes from the aqueduct. No noise at night."

19343,1820105,2,Kasku51,13/04/2022,"Squares inclined laterally and longitudinally and very short (barely 6 meters). You have to get ass above median and you even invade other seats and even so the nose is left out (7.5 m in my case). Good situation, close to supermarket and gas station. In 15 minutes walking, you are in the center. Segovia deserves better as a Motorhome Area."
19343,1820094,4,Familiariojana,13/04/2022,"The site is good to visit the city. Safe and relatively close to the center. Most of the squares are uneven, but the worst is the people. Ac crossed occupying various spaces and vans with clothes hanging by the hedges. We have to do things better if we want them to enable us to park spaces"
19343,1819317,3,aiportela,13/04/2022,"Unleveled, short places we have to put the rear on the sidewalk, submerged water supply that does not guarantee hygiene."
19343,1811611,5,SyncroAdventures,09/04/2022,Close to the aqueduct area (15 minute walk) and nice quiet lot. More RVs would fit with more courteous parking (lots of spaces between RVs). We arrived in the afternoon and got one of the last open spots that we could fit in.
19343,1808650,4,Carivan,06/04/2022,"Well, the area is a little sloping but good and quiet. 15 minutes from the aqueduct. All free services. Thanks to the council."

19343,1802503,4,rucare88,31/03/2022,"Good place to spend the night. Maximum 72 hours. Supermarkets very close, laundry, gas station in front... The only drawback is that the squares are a little inclined, otherwise very good."
19343,1793630,4,sciroco,24/03/2022,"Perfect parking, on the other hand just a small grid for emptying. It's not ideal, but it's not bad."
19343,1785542,5,dumonteixcathy,17/03/2022,"Very good for the visit of the city, quiet night clean and pleasant place, good day to you all Cathy"
19343,1785228,3,jpcath,16/03/2022,this car park has the merit of existing. the gray water drain is unsuitable (small grid). water is filled with a connection in the ground. there are 20 places including 2 for people with reduced mobility. some places are limited in length because of the trees. not suitable for people over 8m. lighted parking lot. trash can nearby.
19343,1779628,2,RamonKTF,11/03/2022,Segovia deserves an area with more capacity and better adapted to the needs of motorhomes
19343,1777795,3,bettyboop29700,08/03/2022,"located near the city center, a good kilometer on foot. The car park is a little sloping but the use of chocks is authorized. perfect for a stopover and a visit."

19343,1775900,3,bkb,06/03/2022,"Parking on a slight slope with services. Very close to the aqueduct which you have to follow to get to the center of the historic district. Too bad that due to the market, this area has to be freed on Saturdays from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. As a result, motorhomes invade the very sloping adjacent car parks from Friday evening while waiting to return to their finally liberated area."
19343,1775524,4,Sissi22,06/03/2022,Thank you to the municipality for this beautiful area. Very nice city that we did by bike. Ground water service. Quiet night
19343,1774512,4,CagouilleExpress,05/03/2022,"Parking quickly full even in this season so it's better to get there in the morning. Quiet, free, only 15 minutes walk from the city. The places are not delimited so you have to park with common sense. The services are on the ground hidden under ground plates next to the motorhome sign."
19343,1773304,3,doezi,04/03/2022,"We stayed here for one night without using the facilities (they aren't that great). But we stayed quiet, safe, free, and quickly got into town on the bus across the street (pay to the driver, 1 euro per person)."
19343,1770759,3,eddock,02/03/2022,"Well situated to visit the beautiful town of Segovia (15 mins walk). Quiet parking area and relatively flat (some places need chocks). There’s a drain with a lift up cover intended for emptying water next to the official camping car sign, but no ‘drive over’ emptying facilities. max stay was noted as 72 hours on the sign."
19343,1770297,3,jcastellp,01/03/2022,"The area is spacious and quite quiet. The squares are uneven, but the use of wedges is allowed. The battery seats are 6 meters long. The download area is bad. Less than a quarter of an hour's walk to the center. If you don't want to walk, there is a bus stop 11 right there."
19343,1769766,3,Fidjie,01/03/2022,Parking well placed to visit this beautiful city. You have to arrive early for a large 8m motorhome. No need to put the wedges. Quiet place without service. Thank you to the city for allowing us parking.
19343,1768412,3,ErJosete,27/02/2022,"A normal place to visit Segovia, very inclined and full of cars. We can't park anywhere but cars seem to be able to, preventing colleagues from using the area."
19343,1766839,3,Peterpwh,26/02/2022,"This area has two hydrants that are wider than normal and on the ground, I had to freeze my hand to fill. If you go on the weekend there are kids competing who want to make more noise with the tuned car at dawn. I didn't stay more times even if they paid me for it."
19343,1765171,5,kyky49,25/02/2022,"we spent 2 nights on this CC area. the pretty town is close to walk there. the services are discreet, at the bottom left. gas station, supermarket and selective sorting nearby. ideal for visiting. thank you to the municipality for this stop in front of the arenas."
19343,1763230,3,juanini,22/02/2022,"A capital like Segovia requires something more careful. It is appreciated that you reserve an area. But a black or gray water disposal point, as well as a water intake, does not require much more infrastructure than they already have and would be much more hygienic. Another point is that they park cars and leave the places. Otherwise the location is good. Quiet."
19343,1763138,4,Pancho,22/02/2022,"Quiet, in the city, 30 minutes walk from the center of the old town (12 minutes by bike). There are many motorhomes and therefore a collective supervisor. Emptying the cassette ok but the water did not work."
19343,1759193,4,Armendrolo,18/02/2022,"Well located and with services around. On Saturdays from 7 am to 5 pm you can't park for an open-air market. The water intake on the ground, as well as the black water area. For the gray ones there is a small sewer, but only if you have the drain on one side. Very quiet area and with police passing several times a day. Slightly sloping area, but with some chocks all fixed."
19343,1749929,2,elnieto1981,07/02/2022,"well located, but I didn't like the water change issue. I was able to empty but not load as it was a water intake on the ground. the inclined squares, but with wedges it is solved."

19343,1735592,5,Seseliyo,17/01/2022,Perfect to visit the city and spend the night. Floor a little uneven but you can put chocks. The water discharge area could be better but in any case it is fine and can be used perfectly!
19343,1733952,5,PinarCaravan,14/01/2022,"05.01.22 Perfect. Very comfortable, the theme of water and download the worst. Little conditioning. We are not encouraged to use it. It's all on the ground like manhole covers. Hygienic?. Comfortable to visit the city about 15min walk. Somewhat uneven, chocks necessary. For cars with big asses 7.40m you have to find the right place, you eat up a lot of sidewalk. A great night. We will repeat for sure."
19343,1731418,4,Aleximonica,10/01/2022,"Parking very close to the center, quiet area to spend the night. Although there are many cars there is plenty of space to park, highly recommended."
19343,1730584,2,Daviperez,09/01/2022,"The intention is good, it is very well located near the center. Being Saturday night there has been a lot of noise from motorcycles circling around the parking lot. We have not been able to rest. Very short squares and with trees behind that do not allow the use of some squares. They have a lot to improve."
19343,1730463,4,Channelchallenger,09/01/2022,"Quiet place to spend the night, counting that we are in a city, for the filling and emptying of water there are some boxes on the ground, gas and propane gas station, Day supermarket next door. 15 min walk to the aqueduct"
19343,1728719,4,antuanrocamora,07/01/2022,"All correct, very quiet at night, near the center, about 15 minutes and near the DIA supermarket about 2 minutes. The worst is the loading and unloading of water that should give it a spin because it is quite uncomfortable. Anyway we cannot complain because we were luxurious"
19343,1728181,3,Muelles,06/01/2022,"It is not a bad place, but certain aspects should be improved to make it 5 stars. The water filling is in a casket, as is the emptying of sewage. Very fair parking lots, especially long. It is inclined but they allow to put chocks. Gas station and supermarket 3 minutes walk. City Center 15 minutes walk"
19343,1725776,4,GPSLM,04/01/2022,"Well located. Being in a rather noisy city. It takes little time to reach the aqueduct and it is very close to a road safety park. All services ok. Water with phenomenal pressure to fill. We went with a 7.5 meter motorhome, and it was right in the places that faced the bullring. It was the first of the Year and we were accompanied by a score of motorhomes."
19343,1725349,3,Elduayen,04/01/2022,"The services are not seen by being on the ground. Ac area but not adapted, it was like a car park and it occurred to them to put the area there but hey, it's free. You need chocks due to the inclination of the services but they cannot be seen because they are on the ground, even the water one, very rare, but they work. It is about 20 min walk from the center."
19343,1724236,4,VanessaAlvarado,03/01/2022,Fairly good. Fair places and somewhat uneven but they allow use of chocks. Downtown is within walking distance. Thanks to the City Council for preparing a space for us.
19343,1722230,4,park4cc,01/01/2022,"During this period, at the end of December, a lot of people. Parking a little sloping but correct. Quiet night. Proximity on foot to the superb town center, its shops and its activities. The night aqueduct is worth a look. The services functional but a little strange to be buried and taps under water."
19343,1719973,1,vikiub,30/12/2021,"It is a car park that they have enabled a part for motorhomes, the service area is very bad, everything is on the ground, the water filling tap is on the ground and completely covered with water, it gives a feeling of unhygienic ... ..... we spent one night and there was a lot of noise of young people going around again and again with cars and motorcycles and shouting."
19343,1718695,1,nanoyoda111,29/12/2021,"Another car park where they let us sleep. If you have something longer than 5 meters, forget it and since you have a bike rack on top, the one in the back does not park. Unlevel even with chocks Very fair emptying and filling area. A pity that a city like this does not treat us better. We ate (in the motorhome) and left so we cannot rate it. night. During the day a lot of noise. No garbage."

19343,1677933,1,noranahiN,04/11/2021,"I'm not giving it more stars because we had to leave. It was full, to maneuver and enter some plot ... the narrow space for AC of 7.50m. Upon entering ... nose out and quite a bit and from behind you go out and if you have bikes many more. We were excited about the city but ... nothing! the services are not the most adequate either.

There is movement of cars also at that time, but then it relaxes the thing. Emptying / filling.

19343,1532969,1,pioloban,30/08/2021,"Terrible area the worst in which I have been and not because of the ares itself that has a lot of slope if not because of the atmosphere Monday, August 30, we did not get to read the comments below but cars skidding, people drinking and screaming a horror, It is good to visit the city but not much less to spend the night. WE HAVE HAD TO GO TO SLEEP ELSEWHERE AT 11:30 PM."
19343,1524144,5,melicenero,28/08/2021,"Motorhome area, quite good, we had no problem parking a 7.50m motorhome and we spent the night without problem"
19343,1514312,3,Jucarperez,26/08/2021,"Parking area, battery spaces are short. The squares online are pretty good. The black drain is on the floor and does not have a water tap to clean. The water filling is also a hatch in the ground and is flooded with water with the tap under water. I did not fill it because I did not see it very healthy. The gray casting is not very conditioned to our needs either."
19343,1513495,3,Danemfi,26/08/2021,"Area in the middle of the parking lot, fair places for long AC, the correct filling and emptying site. Near the center as well as supermarkets. Thanks to the city council for providing a site in your city. It is recommended to do a free tour!"
19343,1508852,3,Beltranejeros,24/08/2021,"At first glance we did not like the site very much. Long motorhomes do not fit well on a battery, if there is another parked on the other side, which reduces the parking space. It is not level. Regular water drainage. The best: it is close to visit Segovia and we spent a quiet night (during the week). On Saturday they put on a flea market and you can't be there."
19343,1503343,3,AntonioCuadrado,23/08/2021,"For those who do not know, the City Council of Segovia plans to close this area. When I have news of the new location, I will be counting it."
19343,1499928,3,IMF,22/08/2021,"Full area with gray and black drain, filled with clean, little shade and a little uneven, especially at the top, enough room. About 5 minutes walk from the beginning of the aqueduct, and about 15 from the center where most of the bars and restaurants, gas station and supermarkets are very close."
19343,1496521,3,nuquesu,22/08/2021,Good area to visit Segovia
19343,1489629,5,asrlpb,20/08/2021,"Great place to visit the city, free municipal area. Outside of summer times, very quiet."
19343,1478305,3,PiratayMarvel,18/08/2021,"Good place to leave the AC and visit the city. There is no shade, and you have to come early to find a spot."
19343,1475377,3,thonysevilla,18/08/2021,"Okay, but there is very little flat area. Then the parking lots in the flat area hinder the unloading. But generally very quiet"
19343,1474523,3,sabimenendez,18/08/2021,"Good detail on the part of the City Council that they have thought about the motorhomes but it is a pity that the design has been regular. The loading tap in a chest on the ground is not very hygienic and the black emptying area does not have a tap to wash the pot and clean the area. It seems that they are thinking of changing the area to another place, to see if the design is better. Anyway, be thankful that there is something"
19343,1464487,3,123VAMOS,16/08/2021,"Good place to visit Segovia. It is right in front of the bullring, the bad thing about the place is the water tap."
19343,1452469,4,pancholon,13/08/2021,"We spent one night and everything was very quiet, there were about 10 or 12 more motorhomes and no problem, there is a sign that warns that on Saturdays they leave at 7 am to put a market, therefore on Friday night you have to find another place or get up early to get off"
19343,1443278,4,ConLunitavan1,12/08/2021,"We spent one night, very quiet place, a walk away from everything and without services, everything ok"
19343,1438542,3,KaneloAntonio,11/08/2021,I think that Segovia deserves a better Area for the Tourist City which is the Area only from Monday to Friday the squares on a slope and few squares I would recommend visiting Segovia but if you can pass from this Area better I do not recommend
19343,1436559,4,Almindra,10/08/2021,"It is good to spend a night to see Segovia there is a car at night, a gas station just behind and a supermarket by day. all very close"
19343,1429639,4,jabidelafontaine,09/08/2021,"Perfect, ten minutes from the center, we sleep Friday to Saturday without problems but you have to get upstairs, in the bottom you have to leave it at seven o'clock for the weekly market"
19343,1423701,5,yunakira,08/08/2021,"We stayed one night and super good, with free emptying and filling. 10 minutes from downtown by motorcycle."
19343,1419117,4,brodroq,07/08/2021,"A perfect place, secluded and 15 min walk to the center (avda del aqueducto). Thanks to the city council of Segovia and to those who have opted for such areas."
19343,1417606,1,jaimegpuente,07/08/2021,"The only decent thing in this area is the service area and today Saturday unused by the market! It would be very difficult to leave the services square free! In short, disastrous management of the town hall"
19343,1414734,1,Inma4,06/08/2021,"On Friday, July 30, we parked in the lower part but the municipal authorities kindly advised us to move towards the upper part x Saturday market and despite our warning of seeing cars and motorcycles pass by with loud music, skidding and high speed but we We were forced to leave at one in the morning because of the bottle that was organized in the vicinity, which was scary"
19343,1407762,3,Kelly75,05/08/2021,Very fair parking for large motorhomes. About 15 minutes from downtown. It is good to visit Segovia and recharge or drain gray water.
19343,1402376,3,annairaul,04/08/2021,"To spend a correct night, without more. 15 minutes from the aqueduct on foot. There is to empty sewage but to fill it is necessary to have a hose. It is true that it is a place for bottles we saw some cars on Tuesday that are there making noise but the truth is that they left immediately and since they were on the other side they did not bother. Maybe in the end it will be different."
19343,1402176,4,carba,04/08/2021,A little inclined but to sleep one night it served us. Quite quiet area.
19343,1401549,3,beticoluis,04/08/2021,"Good area to visit the city. 15 minutes from the aqueduct. almost no plot is level. On Saturdays there is a flea market and you cannot park. We did not get any bottle, we believe that by curfew."
19343,1401517,4,Cristhian,04/08/2021,"Quiet place, we did not spend the night, but we used it to visit Segovia. Nearby there is a Día supermarket, Repsol service station and the bus stop, which I took line 5, to get to the center (Colón)."
19343,1395915,4,LaCaravanista,02/08/2021,Quiet night (Sunday to Monday). 1.5 km from the Aqueduct and 3 km from the Alcazar. Public transport next door.
19343,1388562,1,SiraPontus,01/08/2021,"It was a horrible stay in this area. At 2 in the morning we had to leave. There were about 20 lads with a bottle, with music blasting, accelerating and skidding cars! we were about 20 AC. The police did not appear there. I became afraid that they would do something to the ACs."
19343,1346466,5,inmacuu,21/07/2021,We went on a Tuesday in July and it was very quiet and clean.
19343,1323980,3,Angel425,14/07/2021,"Thanks to the City Council for the area, but note that a better performance of the water intakes and emptying of blacks would have been Fantastic. Thanks for everything."
19343,1304520,1,Dcbracho,07/07/2021,"We had to go, bottle, loud music and noises of cars skidding and accelerating. The police don't pass through here, not even by chance."
19343,1302416,4,xeremind,07/07/2021,"Very close to city downtown and has a supermarket nearby. Didn't have noise during the night but, if I had, the option to be in a motorhome in a city car park was mine so I had to face the consequences."
19343,1291699,1,jcatot,02/07/2021,"I've put a 1 because you can't get a 0. In half an hour we are gone. kids spinning, bottle and the police nothing at all. It is not an area, it is a parking lot with a drop. nearby there is a library car park, quiet but further from the center. an embarrassment to a big city"
19343,1283313,1,tigresa,28/06/2021,"Pesima !, there is no emptying or filling, more parking than area"
19343,1275046,3,juanreus,24/06/2021,The beautiful city ... but the area I did not like at all very far from the center..and to load and unload fatal very bad ... and then all the cars and motorcycles passing every moment .... I did not like it
19343,1271869,4,luisfamara,23/06/2021,"A good place, except for the kids with the cars and loud music bothering you."
19343,1263467,3,Perejo,19/06/2021,"The first thing, not sleeping on Friday nights, kids partying and the market at 7am. Somewhat inclined. 15min from the center on foot and with the possibility of free filling and emptying."
19343,1252179,4,josemmmeira,13/06/2021,We spent a peaceful night. excellent for visiting the city.
19343,1243817,2,jsin,08/06/2021,"To see the city. Close to the center on foot. The water intake (2), on the ground and flooded. Slightly inclined the squares."
19343,1243680,1,gusepe,08/06/2021,"Despite having read the comments, I decided to take a risk and those of the races, exhaust pipes, bottles, spree and bad vibes did not fail their appointment. Not to mention that the squares are very uneven and in the area they put a market on Saturdays, with which the police kick you out at 6 in the morning"
19343,1240002,5,Pardiko,06/06/2021,"The water filling, under a hatch, must be fixed where it is and the screw nozzle is the big one, emptied well. The historic center is a bit far, half an hour walk. Quiet place."
19343,1225974,3,furgobelix,30/05/2021,"An area with a very good location, we were very quiet from Saturday to Sunday except that from time to time cars and motorcycles pass by making noise the aqueduct in 10 minutes we will return"
19343,1211902,1,laura-rguez,23/05/2021,"Worst caravan area I have ever been to. Drinking people, loud music, skidding cars and motorcycles. No control by the police. He does not squeeze his eye all night."
19343,1205736,3,lagartijaonroad,18/05/2021,"It is more of a parking lot than an area, well located to visit the city and free. It is not worth it to spend the night."
19343,1200536,1,AlbertoChamorro,15/05/2021,"It looked bad in the afternoon and at night I had to go. Skidding cars, butt pipes, bad people ... a shame that a good area is not taken care of by the town hall"
19343,1160827,1,G.G.M,30/03/2021,"First site in years I've been away. Bent over, people cheating, bottle, skidding, beeps, and the next day a flea market. For the short time we were there, some funny man threw us a glass like chocolate. We went to a camp that also comes in the app and perfect."
19343,1160776,4,Elmanolo,29/03/2021,The area is correct with water for filling and emptying. It takes 10 minutes to walk to the aqueduct. BEWARE IF THERE IS NO REMAINING TOUCH because young people gather with cars and probably make noise .... I spent one night but then I spent another next to the mint and I liked it more.
19343,1142451,2,Raybak,25/02/2021,Not terrible. Whether it is for sleeping because it is not flat or for the services that are not practical.
19343,1139186,1,Fernandotkd,19/02/2021,"Simply. This cannot be called an Area, let's leave it in a parking lot, inclined and without motorhome spaces."
19343,1137715,4,patritere,15/02/2021,"Very quiet, night without problems. near the center. Be careful with the water tap ... opening it I started dripping, how stupid I am;)"
19343,1127268,4,LauraMartin,02/01/2021,"We did not use the drains, we only slept, but it is fine, although a little uneven, it is fixed with chocks. A short walk from the center"
19343,1117271,5,YunuCC,23/11/2020,Super location 15 minutes from downtown. Quiet and feel safe!
19343,1107089,4,CarlosS,27/10/2020,We have spent one night and everything is very quiet. Square slightly sloping but hardly noticeable. The drainage and water filling only in one square and a bit difficult since it is on the ground under some metal plates. Be careful when opening the water tap because it comes out with a lot of pressure. Gas station nearby.
19343,1100933,3,jaimegpuente,21/10/2020,"For filling and emptying ok, but only ok since the tap is on the ground! To spend the night there are better and quieter places"
19343,1089458,4,Antoniofj,11/10/2020,"Located 15 minutes walk from the Center of Segovia, the area is perfectly usable and has the usual water services, and gray and potti discharge. The discharge is a bit strange because it is under some iron doors and care must be taken when opening the tap for drinking water by inserting the hose into the outlet before testing the tap so as not to give a"
19343,1071589,1,Rotcerlin,27/09/2020,"We were there for the weekend and the experience couldn't have been worse. Until six in the morning, a multitude of young people making a bottle and what is worse, with the cars among the motorhomes racing. It must be added that they are pandemic dates and the police did not deign to appear. A shame. The site itself is no wonder. The car parks are all sloping although it is allowed to wedge the vehicle, the drains are the worst I have seen in this type of complex. Badly positioned and difficult to access. In short, very bad for Segovia."
19343,1071558,2,Juanangarcia,27/09/2020,"The truth is that regular. The sloping squares, the filling and emptying a little strange, the gray one you have to carry a hose for it ... I guess that only on Friday and Saturday there is a lot of fuss of people making bottles and with cars passing through the parking lot and surroundings ... I don't think it's a good zone for the area"
19343,1064652,5,kimhenro,22/09/2020,"I add that it seems impossible that in all of Segovia, there is no other place to hold a market on Saturdays! (I suggest the area around the bullring, here next door)"
19343,1063491,2,chiquitin,22/09/2020,"It is a bit uneven, with the chocks well, filling and emptying leaves much to be desired, and there is always someone illuminated who spends the night in that square, but we slept well on Monday night."
19343,1059226,1,guillermo67,20/09/2020,A lot of noise at night people making bottle car races the parking lot is on a slope if you want to empty without a hose impossible I think we won't come back anymore
19343,1053598,4,Nano1,17/09/2020,"We have spent one night and the place is very good, close to the center. There were more motorhomes and camper, to return to Segovia, this is the best place to spend the night."
19343,1042023,5,shunzero,11/09/2020,I was one night and very quiet. There were several motorhomes and I parked with them. Perfect for spending the night. It has water services and there was no cost.
19343,1037716,4,FurgoMarquesa,09/09/2020,"We did not see anything to pay so I assume they have taken it away, a quiet daytime place at night is safe but kids go in cars to drink and they make a lot of noise so maybe you are not lucky like us. empty for poti"
19343,1033105,4,LuisFernandoJimenez,07/09/2020,"It is appreciated that there are areas in Spanish cities but they would also have to think a little bit the two water intakes are of the same size and on top of that they are larger than the usual ones, and it is quite inclined. the good thing is that they let you put chocks and open windows. for the reason of the water intakes I cannot give it a 5."
19343,1032533,5,tchafe,07/09/2020,"We slept one night with the camper and we have been super comfortable. Quiet place, very close to the center. About 10min walk. It has to empty toilet, right next to it has a gas station and a day supermarket."
19343,1031322,5,alejandrocostas,06/09/2020,"One step away from the center, the filling and emptying outlets are a bit hidden under some manholes in the last parking space, 2 blue covers and 1 red. even being close to the center it is a very quiet area"
19343,1000847,5,ronin40693,25/08/2020,"Good place to spend the night. Discharge of liquids and take to load water. clean and with medium spaces although there is no problem to park more than 7 meters It is no longer an area, now it is parking for motorhomes and it is free It is a short walk from the center but it is worth it because it is a very quiet and apparently safe place."
19343,998723,4,FabrizioMoschetto,24/08/2020,Convenient for visiting the city. we stayed one night and half of the seats are unusable due to the trees on the sidewalk. good 15 minute walk to get to the aqueduct.
19343,994443,5,alirayo,23/08/2020,The night we spent there was full. It is close and has everything. A little noise in the morning

19343,985804,3,Ro.androll,20/08/2020,"Quiet place to spend the night, with drainage of gray and black, there is a supermarket nearby, the historic center about 15 minutes walk. at 6:45 a.m. the gardener woke us up with the leaf blower ... little consideration on his part for all the people who were there sleeping in the motorhomes"
19343,983704,4,DavidDS,20/08/2020,"Quiet place and close to visit Segovia, we walked to the center in 10 min and to the Alcazar that is spectacular and when it was time to get off at the aqueduct we took bus n ° 5 that leaves you next to the parking lot."
19343,980872,4,uriplans,19/08/2020,perfect area to spend the night and visit the city.
19343,977662,5,Tamasco,18/08/2020,"Good area for motorhomes. Spend one night and there were about 20 motorhomes. Free water, gray water and sewage services. The town hall allows opening windows and skylights."
19343,970824,4,josemleon2,16/08/2020,Comfortable area to visit the city and spend the night although a little inclined in some places. We sleep soundly but very hot at noon
19343,968266,4,Didiruca06,16/08/2020,"If it has services, it is an easily confused corner square, in fact many people do not realize it and park there, The taps on the ground a bit strange but we can not complain, free area, large and quiet. A bit of a slope and if you catch the squares of the shady trees to eat. It takes 10 minutes to walk to the aqueduct and twice as long to the alcazar. Highly recommended."
19343,949629,4,tologorri,11/08/2020,Near the center. No services but correct for one night. Saturdays closed parking from 7 to 17 by market so you have to move the AC if you have spent the night there.
19343,931871,5,porterosbe,05/08/2020,"Everything is perfect, the taps to catch water are on the ground and the emptying of the pot as well, those for clean water in blue and the one for the pot in red, try not to park in this area as it is also the emptying area and yes it parks can not be used, otherwise very well, quiet area 15 min. Walking to the aqueduct. Totally recommendable."
19343,930547,4,lifejuani,05/08/2020,"We only parked the van during our visit to Segovia and the truth is that very well because as there are more caravans and vans, you feel safe to park here because you know that there will always be people watching. The only downside is that it is a bit far from the old town, a 20min walk."
19343,877851,4,anaranjada,18/07/2020,"The site is well conditioned, many places, and has to discharge the waters. Warning: we arrived on a Friday afternoon, and at 6am we were awakened by noise ... they were setting up the street market. A man told us that there is a sign (which we did not see !!) indicating that on Saturdays they put a market there and that the local police would come to evict us."
19343,859690,5,jortfem,10/07/2020,Perfect place to visit the city. It is not level but to spend the nights and visit the city more than enough. download black and gray and above FREE !! ??
19343,848992,5,Txemuki,04/07/2020,"Very comfortable access to the city. Peaceful neighborhood. Like other municipal areas, it lacks planning and services. A parking and little else. The location makes up for it."
19343,840995,3,gigirobi,29/06/2020,"I apologize for my review that I put yesterday, and I confirm that the services of loading and unloading of water are embedded in the sidewalk under the informative poster how it can be seen in the photos."
19343,840453,2,gigirobi,28/06/2020,Today there is no service
19343,789089,4,ruben.daval,01/03/2020,"Good place to visit the city. A bit of a cost, but fine"
19343,784521,5,kikurru,22/02/2020,Very good the only downside that sometimes some occupies more than one place
19343,775441,3,Eddie12,02/02/2020,"Sloping and without toilets. It is 120 and not 1220 as indicated, and again, not counting the clowns who park sideways and take three places."
19343,765804,5,Nrk,07/01/2020,"Site near the center. We slept with a little inclination, but nothing that affected the rest. Quiet to spend the night."
19343,765741,4,garaziazkue,07/01/2020,"It is very appreciated that there is such a place in Segovia. It is a bit inclined but salvageable. Near the center and nice place. The loading and unloading of water is better done elsewhere, it is not comfortable."
19343,764518,4,miguelborox,05/01/2020,"Near the center of Segovia, little noise and quiet area, gray and black water drainage service, and clean water load, with poor access since the tap is on the ground and is usually flooded with water (with hose connection 1 "") necessary chocks since it has a low inclination."
19343,763498,4,Triceps,03/01/2020,"Near the aqueduct, 10-15 minutes walk. Quiet place, free. As they have written before, the position of the grating grid for grays is rare, and the water intakes are in the water-filled boxes. Good area to know Segovia."
19343,762719,4,cortinass,03/01/2020,Good area and well located. The fact is that the emptying is a bit weird and the filling is inside some boxes that makes it a bit difficult but hey we can't ask for more
19343,760761,4,seb77,31/12/2019,Service area near the city with direct view of the arena. By cons sloping location.
19343,755287,4,boutderoute,20/12/2019,"Free motorhome area in town with services. 15 mins walk from the old town and its superb Roman Aqueduct which is worth the trip alone and above all respect for the builders, Dia supermarket 200 m away. Ideal for 1 night!"
19343,751831,4,kiwionavan,09/12/2019,"Very good option for a visit to the city. I don't put the highest score on it because the service area (water, grays, blacks) is not well thought out and it is not located in the same area. For the rest, everything is perfect. Free and with good bus connection to get to / from the center"
19343,748161,4,Stephye,29/11/2019,"The services are not very accessible because of the cars parked on it but we had planned (we always do the maintenance before arriving to avoid unpleasant surprises). We were 4 campers and a few vans, the night was very quiet. Thanks to the municipality"
19343,742953,4,raul76,14/11/2019,"Starting from the base that is a free service, you have to thank it, it has several qualified places that are not leveled but with the chocks it is fixed, it has emptying of gray and black waters and filling of water with 1 inch socket, it is usually rare that put this type of shots in Spain but in a hardware store in the area I found the record for 2 euros and I already have it just in case it happens to me in another place. If there are more caravans, the place gives you security, the night we stayed overnight there was a subnormal with a car that makes noise to free escape was spent for 4 hours to make passes through the area and stop a few times in our parking , I don't understand how the police wouldn't stop him at some point. otherwise everything is fine, charming city with its aqueduct and very beautiful alcazar"
19343,740092,4,CatarinaS,08/11/2019,"Area next to the log square. Super sloped floor. We didn't use the services because we didn't need to, but it seemed functional (the clean water faucet is on the floor under a lid, but it's equally practical). We were at the end of October and there were people. Quiet at night. Segovia is a beautiful city, worth a visit!"
19343,739156,4,hamonjl,06/11/2019,Very good to visit Segovia and sleep. Same possibility to empty toilets and water. In this season all the place but not alone.
19343,737014,5,RaulSJ,03/11/2019,"Quiet place, without noise and perfect for sleeping and visiting Segovia. The center is about 101-15 minutes walk"
19343,736652,4,soquete,02/11/2019,"Good area to spend the night, although late in the morning, a calorie singing gypsy, was heard in the distance."
19343,732930,2,12021956,29/10/2019,"I think that for such a pretty city, the town could make more effort ... the area is small and sloping sites are too small for motorhomes of 8 m and more .... However there is not really the choice because the other indicated parking are full of cars, earth, and inaccessible ...."
19343,732407,3,HoliSoyPatri,28/10/2019,"The area has filling and emptying services. But there are few places and then people park on the other side (no longer parking of motor homes but cars) where the places are shorter. This causes them to put the ass of the motorhome as much as possible. So you can find, as it happened to us, with which you start to park correctly in your place for motorhome and someone on the other side has invaded your space. If people had a certain civility, speaking it would be enough. But it was not our experience. The uncle was an unpleasant and did not agree to reasons despite being parked illegally. I still regret not calling the police. Total pifostios of this type are mounted. In addition, the area is in the middle of the city where the bullring and its surroundings are not very beautiful. And of course, as always, thanks to Spanish regulations, you can't take anything out of anything. But hey, to spend a night and get to know Segovia, it's plenty. And Segovia is well worth it."
19343,726386,4,lebrivara,20/10/2019,"Public parking, located ten minutes from the aqueduct. Better to arrive late in the afternoon, supermarket and gas station next door. To put a paste, the discharge area is a sewer and must be emptied very carefully, otherwise very well!"
19343,724237,2,ngau,18/10/2019,Use of difficult services in accessibility and in practice. Concentration of DC on each other. Noisy very early in the morning. Securing because regular passage of the police. 1.5 km from the historic center of this beautiful city.
19343,723866,3,Magellan6665,17/10/2019,"Stayed one night with 25 motorhomes, next to a small supermarket and arena. The only asset is an area that fulfills its function with free water and emptying. Would have preferred sleeping in the parking lot behind the hospital near the center, but no other camper, shame."
19343,719996,3,Masseix,13/10/2019,It is a simple city car park but with permission for camping car.police often passes. Very short places in length. Very fair for a normal motorhome but it's ok. absolutely not recommended for camper with trailer or more than 7.5 m. near center following Aqueduct behind the arenes on the left
19343,718491,4,Barcobird,11/10/2019,"Designated spaces on large car park so option to park anywhere. Well lit at night and felt very safe it was also very quiet. All facilities, water taps are in the ground so need a hosepipe. Space for services is not clearly marked (it’s at the bottom opposite disabled spaces) so people kept on parking there, it’s also one of the few level spaces. Supermarket nearby and UNESCO site is about 10-15 minute walk but well worth it."
19343,714957,3,2205,06/10/2019,"This camping area is not in an idyllic environment but very quiet with free services, it's cool! Located 2 kms from the historic center, just pass left side of the arena and once at the boulevard turn left and always straight to fall on the beginning of the aqueduct."
19343,711900,4,theroverlanders,03/10/2019,"Lucky to get a space at 1700, when it came leaving we couldn’t us the facilities as a car had parked there. Easy walk into Segovia and a reasonably quiet night (after the French neighbours had stopped arguing and singing!)"
19343,706960,4,Angoares,28/09/2019,"We spent a night and very good area, the area of water and emptying is where the sign, you have to look carefully because it is on the ground, it was difficult to find it. Segovia a beautiful city."

To empty the toilet also in a red casket, and for wastewater in a rack placed in the ground."
19343,645387,4,HXavier,20/08/2019,"It's a good place for stay. But in the night we stay we heard cars because it's a road with traffic not a road with a dead end. No potable water, no wc."
19343,640507,5,camilla17,18/08/2019,Convenient area for visiting the city as it is within walking distance. We didn't stop for the night but it seems quiet. Worth a stop to admire the splendid and spectacular Roman aqueduct.

19343,585041,3,rvanvugt,30/07/2019,"Basically not bad to offer this municipal parking, being rather close to the old town and offering all basic services. 

Unfortunately the area is not flat and having a road going through it for people living in the adjacent quarter, it simply means continuous traffic, especially during the day. Between 23h00 and 06h00 it's acceptable calm, but then the noise starts. Big construction area closeby.

Watertap hidden in the ground under the blue lids. Position of disposal for your grey and black water is far from ideal, especially if you have a big waterwaste tank with a valve at end- right or left. I couldn't dump my tanks. 

Again, the idea is good, but the execution could be better."

We didn’t stay the night but there are plenty of other motorhomes set up. Only gave a 3 star because we didn’t need to do any of the waters so can’t comment on that.

19398,1055234,5,victordhj,17/09/2020,"It is a camping, La Pedrera. We have been very good, there was hardly anyone. Very quiet, with plenty of space and the bathroom practically just for us (which by the way, was spotless). It has a swimming pool, barbecues, a bar, a children's area and a washer and dryer service. It has a water tap and power outlet in each plot. It cost us € 21 to spend one night."

19406,2359783,4,JMiranda,11/09/2022,"Area under construction, it seems unopened (or maybe I'm wrong) although it attends you if you call and is available to use. We pass fast only for emptying and refilling water. With Mario it was very easy to organize the stop."
19406,1965969,4,voltioss,11/06/2022,I usually park a lot. It has all the services including electricity and barbecues. I only have one drawback.... we have to put the bacon and the chorizos. Cheer up VIRUTA'S!!!!

Emptying of grays, blacks, filled with water, not drinkable, electricity and you pay the will when you go. You call Mario or Mª Jesus, they give you the code to access and it is to close, the door is not self-closing. If we go to the area again, without a doubt we will repeat.

19436,3241024,3,Phieso87,31/08/2023,disappointing campsite in terms of the concept of cap fun lots of dust swimming pool with fairly murky water and in the middle of the campsite facilities resembling barracks.... jellyfish in the sea at the time we went there August expensive for the services
19436,3235929,1,javyermoreno,29/08/2023,"Don't be put off by the brand, it's a favela/fab mix of people who live there with a campsite. Old and poorly maintained facilities. Poor cleaning. We booked for a week and left on the third day despite having paid for it."
19436,3229403,5,Chrislan_at,28/08/2023,"First class campsite. Somewhat expensive, but it has very good services (entertainment, water park, restaurants at a good price, supermarket, etc). The beach that overlooks the campsite, the worst I've seen in the entire Mar Menor. If you go for a few days to relax, it is perfect. If it's not what you need, I'd go for something cheaper."
19436,3161079,1,AA888BB,16/08/2023,"Because I can't give 0. Exorbitant prices and in addition they force you to take 3 nights because they are the only ones on this place, no competition so they allow themselves that. Home more than low-end, not even smiling."
19436,3087677,5,seny85,06/08/2023,"Huge campsite with all the services we love. It has many activities, slides, food to eat there or take you to the plot. Bathrooms taken care of if they are not clean is because many people are not careful. We will be back"
19436,2617139,4,Katka74,20/03/2023,"Nice camping. Beautiful large plots. WC and showers a little weaker, but clean with hot water. Nice cycle paths around. We will definitely be back…"
19436,2616985,3,lac0991,20/03/2023,"Camping by the sea with direct access to the sandy beach. Ideal to go with children or practice water sports. If we start with the positive in the supermarket they have absolutely everything, with good hours, they open every day. The toilets were clean and the restaurant has good hours and a variety of food by the sea. The pitches are spacious, the ground is level, they have water and electricity. That said, in the photos on the web you can see an idyllic campsite with many green areas, pools with slides, activities for children next to the sea. They have these services, but the photos do not correspond to the reality of the camping area, since in those photos the multitude of prefabricated ""houses"" do not appear, even some destroyed shack-like ones that give the campsite a very bad appearance. The green areas are almost non-existent, no trees or shade, just the bushes that divide the plots. In the plots there are no trees, nor are there awnings, nor shade. At night there is only light on the main avenue and access to the campsite is closed at midnight. Finally, they charge you an amount for management fees, apart from the price of the plot, so you end up paying around €30 per night for 2 people with access to all services in low season."
19436,2560255,1,LinceNomada,25/01/2023,"I was asking prices and for a small van a person and a dog 22 euros plus 12 euros for management fees. From my point of view, excessively expensive considering that the place looks like a shanty town and full of dirt"
19436,2559109,4,modestolemos,23/01/2023,"We arrived on New Year's Eve with the idea of 2 days, we stayed 8. For my taste, everything was ok, the bathrooms are always clean, good plots and very quiet for us, very good."

19436,2487422,1,Dukesa,08/11/2022,"The water service for €4 is appreciated but the place looks more like a dump than an AC service site, everything is very dirty. The campsite looks like a shanty town. I give it the star because it is the only place where it can be emptied."
19436,2476002,4,maraguila,01/11/2022,"We passed De los Santos Bridge. The weather was good, pools and slides open. Few people, spacious pitches, clean toilets. We ate very tasty paella at the bar overlooking the manga, highly recommended. I imagine that in summer it is overwhelming but in November it is fine. Indeed, the landline area looks like a chavolista town."
19436,2459853,1,silviapenachao,24/10/2022,"go ahead that I am not demanding or fussy but that is a depressing slum settlement. I only went in for a water change (€4) but I wouldn't stay there or if they gave it to me in gray and black in the same place and be careful not to splash it...I wanted to add the photos of what it is and it won't leave it, it must be for a reason The bad thing is that if we want to empty it, there is no other option but to go there in all of La Manga."
19436,2431227,1,BerniMartin,08/10/2022,The place for supply and disposal for mobile homes is a disaster. The driveway is already an impertinence. I can't say much about the campsite itself.
19436,2415922,1,Zaydaren,01/10/2022,"The service of loading and unloading water for €4 is appreciated, but the place looks more like a dump than a service site for AC and a single sewer for gray and black."

19436,1809303,3,AnnaLisaPr,07/04/2022,Spontaneously stayed for one night. Huge campsite. I wouldn't stay longer because of the size. Weird mood in my opinion. But the staff is super friendly!
19436,1785282,4,teomobil,16/03/2022,Currently a lot of free places. We stayed for 2 weeks.
19436,1763603,4,MichaInes,23/02/2022,"This campsite is really huge, but we had an outdoor space and therefore peace and beautiful sunsets. We didn't have to pay the administration fee for two nights. The place is basically designed for long-term campers. There isn't much to see around here. Supply and disposal ok. Grauwasser must be registered only one place at the back at the end."
19436,1758148,4,bmwb,17/02/2022,"Nice n clean campground. Half is built up with permanent campers. The other half is rental bungalows and RV pitches with power, water and wastewater at the pitch. wanted to stay 3 days but extended to 3 weeks. Very quiet n relaxing in off season."
19436,1748343,4,inamenger,05/02/2022,"Very nice plots delimited by hedges. Larger seats in the front area. We opted for the smaller ones at the back (84 sqm, area L) because they are far enough away from the street and therefore very quiet. Sanitary area very clean but kept simple. Staff very friendly and helpful. We paid €18.70 including electricity per day for a 14-day stay."
19436,1735368,1,hausei,16/01/2022,"we went again, because we were only offered a large pitch (7m camper is too big for the smaller pitches) wouldn't matter at the very high price anyway (23€) of 1€ difference, but the big pitches only next to the autobahn and a construction site. it would have many quieter free smaller places. in addition to the price, a processing fee of 11€, > 5 days even 27€....."
19436,1732282,3,FindusPettson,11/01/2022,"A place that actually offers everything with friendly staff. We were here 7 days. The campsite is huge with 1500 places. A paradise for seniors with dogs, most of whom come from Germany. They are arrogant, rude and conceited. Hardly a kind word. It's not recreation here. Many of the permanent campers' cars drive during the day, almost no one respects 20 km / h."
19436,1709410,4,Type,13/12/2021,A huge camping site. Everything was in order. The mar is not for swimming. The highway next door hardly bothered us. It is nice that the plots are separated by high hedges.
19436,1702490,5,mcFlyby,03/12/2021,Seems ideal to us. €22 a night. We asked to be near the toilet block and we’re put in a nice secluded place next door so catch up on laundry was a doddle. All very pleasant

19436,1611022,2,IdolinaParra,26/09/2021,"We went in August, the very expensive camping, apart from charging the pitch, electricity, children, dogs, they charge you an extra € 11 for ""expenses"". Quite narrow for long motorhomes. Long queues on the slides and to go to the pool. The best, the sailing school on the beach accessible from the campsite."
19436,1560663,2,Salonen,08/09/2021,"The campsite gives the feeling that it is a neighborhood, but being the only alternative of this type in the area, it lives off that."

19436,1463409,3,ntourneux,15/08/2021,"Huge campsite (over 1100 pitches) but the 100m2 pitches are spacious and little shaded. The showers and toilets near the capfun pool (with slides) are not very clean because they are used by campers who come to the pool. On the woman's side, 3 toilets out of 7 are in service. The beach is beautiful from afar but a lot of seaweed (due to the water not being stirred). The water in the Capfun pool is filthy because it is filled with sunscreen. Better to prefer the other pool."
19436,1456080,1,flosticks,14/08/2021,"It's more of a shanty town than a campsite ... Total lack of control, the plot they assigned us was occupied, so the security officer told us to occupy one. The sinks are ASCO. Large but very neglected pitches. Ridiculous pool for the size of the campsite (I mean, queue to get in if you can get it) and the beach is not much of an alternative ... dirty, ugly, brown water."

19436,1429318,4,LuisAreal,09/08/2021,"Access to the gray cast is a mousetrap if you follow the reception directions (between booths and with impossible turns). It is better to follow the main road (asphalt) until the end and once there, turn right, that way you access in a straight line. Black water can be emptied in each toilet area. Very polite and pleasant staff."
19436,1422954,1,firulay,08/08/2021,"Crowded, no safety distance anywhere. The beach is a dirty quagmire full of seaweed the little commons for so many people. We did not like it ."

19436,1394827,3,Jg91,02/08/2021,"Large, not unpleasant campsite, you have to walk because it is all along. The pitches are nice but the alleys are small to steer with the camper. The toilets are moderately clean and there the beaches the water is cloudy and you can walk to knees therefore forgot swimming. The water park is fun for the kids."
19436,1323058,4,JrRamone,14/07/2021,"Giant campsite on the shore of Mar Menor, all services and great entertainment perfect for families. Large pitches with some shade. Many parcels on the main street are straight brick houses. A bit far from La Manga to visit it although there is no parking problem even in high season. For the all very good. € 33 two people, motorhome and electricity."
19436,1305506,3,ilviha,08/07/2021,It is quite large. It has direct access to a beach with very cloudy water and sand that seems to be built. The slides and pools are fun. The girl from the kiosk of the slide pool serving without a mask. Passable animation for children. Large gravel pitches with water and electricity. Access to a somewhat narrow plot for ac but it passes. Insufficient covid measures.
19436,1292245,4,MartinAns,03/07/2021,The place has a good location! It's very big and clean! The sanitary facilities were cleaned several times a day. There is also a beach nearby!
19436,1247607,3,ongarri,10/06/2021,"Peculiar camping, with a high percentage of fixed population, it is like a small but heterogeneous urbanization. Correct services without more, spacious plots and exit to the beach or something similar in the case of the Mar Menor. Expensive pelin"
19436,1172607,1,didierKZO,12/04/2021,ENGLISH: DO NOT GO IT is very expensive 36 and 38 € for one night for 2 motorhomes. We had to check before coming that the heated swimming pool was working and we bought the tickets on Sunday evening when we arrived and Monday morning we discovered that it was broken down in front of the door or nothing in particular was indicated. We were overcharged on the grounds that it was a public holiday in France when we are on 04/10 !!!! we were taken for Pigeons. It's up to you to see if you want to pay a lot in an old campsite and not beautiful because a lot of mobile men more or less maintained
19436,1172541,1,leszebresnomades,12/04/2021,"Dishonest camping. We called to find out if the pool was open and after validation we suddenly came. After selling us tickets, the next day waiting for us in front of the indoor pool, we learned that it was the unheated outdoor pool (because it had broken down) and not the one I had specified. Fortunately, reimbursement of the pool is possible. We asked to pay the night for 2 camper vans and we were told it was a public holiday in France (although not at all) and suddenly high season price is 76 € for 2 camper vans of 6m for 1 night. We never come camping but 76 € for one night, we think it was a lot especially when the campsite is empty, old, dirty and broken. We will of course not be coming back here again and we said with respect to the reception that he was not being honest as they knew it was not a public holiday in France and that it is no longer holy week in Spain."
19436,1171730,4,TenaciousThie,10/04/2021,"Exciting place, there really is something for everyone here. The children can enjoy themselves. It is super interesting to walk through the whole corridors and to look at the often lovingly furnished ""little houses"". Purchase prices currently between 30,000-150,000 € -wow- this is a small town in itself!"
19436,1118153,3,debwilliams,28/11/2020,21 euros a night .. very quiet but would expect in normal years busy .. has own beach and restaurant.. indoor swimming pool at extra cost .. a lot of long term residents here
19436,1051761,1,IsabelCharra,16/09/2020,"The worst campsite we've ever been to! More than a camping they seem like favelas ... all full of ""shacks"". Also, being such a large campsite and having no indication anywhere, it seems like a labyrinth to find your plot. The services are very old although that is, apparently clean. The only good thing I saw is that it has a direct exit to a beach in the Mar Menor, however, this one is quite bad, with very very cloudy water."

The beach and sprinkle with palm trees, offering a bit of shade, however the sea is extremely hot, ideal for children because foot far away. In view of the many negative comments, we hesitated to cancel our reservation. However we were pleasantly surprised. Only downside, this campsite is very large, 1 km long, and so many people everywhere."
19436,606487,1,Vlc74,07/08/2019,"Not recommended, camping without shade and very hot. The beach is horrible, the water is very hot. Plagued with flies !!!! The beach restaurant is fine.

They allowed us to enter at 7.00 AM"
19436,596741,2,tekita,04/08/2019,"Very friendly and polite staff. Organized. The dumping ground for camper vans is in an unlikely area. However, due to radio communication between staff, evictions are uneventful. Very expensive . Too many buildings, which in certain areas make it forget that this is a campsite."

The staff at the reception is friendly and friendly and told us where to hike in the surrounding area (Regional Park of Calblanque and Sierra de Cabo Tiñoso, Bateria de Castillitos).

Personally, I do not like: the world everywhere, noise, a night entertainment until midnight (impossible to sleep before). Direct access to the inner beach which is very dirty, too dirty. To flee for those who love calm."

We spent a quite night in this free carpark. There were some people using the bins during the evening and a little road noise but other than that we slept well. 
There are no services except bins.

We had to use chocks because of the shower drain as we reversed into the space with the park behind us due to our bikes out the back. If we drove into the space we would have been ok.

Marcadona is a 10 minute walk away. There is a Lidl on the outskirts of the town. There are plenty of restaurants/bars for food and menu del dia.

The town is a 10 minutes walk away. This is a tourist town but there is plenty to see, so no real holdups. Part of the town is quite hilly. 

There is a lovely circuit walk (about 1.5hrs) into the valley and back into the town putting a different prospective on the views. Take a right out the carpark with the views on your left. 
Go down the road about 100 meters and take the dirt track on the left. At the junction take the left dirt track, a sharp left. Keep going and you will notice a narrow track between boundaries on your right as this dirt track is a dead end. It is not marked. Follow this to another dirt road and take a right, take a left at next junction and you will come out on the main valley road. Take a left and follow this all the way into the town."
