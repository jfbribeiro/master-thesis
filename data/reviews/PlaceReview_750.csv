20604,3274731,1,arbsent,08/09/2023,"Very bad, horrible open air disco next door. A 0 for the city council and municipal technicians for poor management. If this is the example we give to tourism, turn it off and let's go."
20604,3269944,4,IPP80,07/09/2023,"It is perfect for visiting the city. It is a bit expensive and the pitches, if full, are very small."
20604,3261729,2,Very1991,05/09/2023,"Excellent location, close to the city center. Electricity for a fee, there are no charging stations but only where there is a water drainage area there is only one paid socket at €2/hour. No bathrooms. Water tap €2/100 l. Expensive compared to the standards of the area. It deserves 2 stars just for the location."
20604,3259047,5,SonnItaly,04/09/2023,"Very convenient parking for visiting Cordoba. We stayed for 2 nights. Loading, unloading. Safe, guarded with a bar at the entrance. On dirt road, slightly sloped. Advised."
20604,3254317,5,titidu64100,03/09/2023,Perfect for visiting CÓRDOBA!
20604,3246414,1,aventurero77,01/09/2023,"One horrible night, a concert in the hall next door ended and a group of young people hit the motorhomes. Those responsible did not attend to the damage and the next night we left because everything remained the same. There are better options outside the center."
20604,3245826,1,PensionistasAC,01/09/2023,"Bad experience, unguarded and open premises. Some young people who were drinking until late at night said goodbye to the place by throwing stones at those of us who were trying to sleep there. I know that this fact is not isolated since the workers already warned us and pointed out the amount of stones that abound there. A real shame for beautiful and welcoming Córdoba."
20604,3197736,4,Javicamo,22/08/2023,We were looking for other options in Córdoba but they did not give us security. It is not cheap and only includes sewage and emptying service. The rest is paid. I was little taken care of. We slept well. recommendable
20604,3190791,4,bidochons17,20/08/2023,Hot night despite a very good place under the East West trees. Slope of the land very correct despite everything we have read on the site... ideal and very close on foot to visit this city full of history. Do not hesitate!!!
20604,3182914,3,Giucar,19/08/2023,convenient for visiting cordoba a bit expensive for the services it offers
20604,3130693,3,mpiva,12/08/2023,"As described, no more, no less! One star less because entering at 1950 and leaving at 4pm the following day (<24h) he made us pay the full rate (€23) which is a lot considering the services aside. There are cameras everywhere. Really convenient for visiting the Mezquita and the city center ... 15 min walk."
20604,3016231,3,vidasman,25/07/2023,"It has the advantage of being very central for those who want to visit Cordoba. It is a typically urban parking lot, in a quiet area. There is shade in the upper part of the park which helps on hot days. The cost is high for a parking lot where services are paid separately, but this is normal in city parks. It has a point of water and electricity, paid separately and for a limited time"
20604,2949090,2,OrlandoSamon,11/07/2023,Sloped parking. Quiet to spend the night. Very expensive and without services. €23 from 11:30 p.m. to 9:30 a.m....
20604,2938992,3,dasafru,08/07/2023,Central parking with service for motorhomes that are paid separately. it is a dirt and sloping car park. with shims solved. expensive for what it is... at least you can spend the night.
20604,2935455,4,RFLL,08/07/2023,"We spent one night here in July and enjoyed the park. Mainly because of its proximity to the historic center and Cruz Conde park. It has shadows and is quiet. We didn't give it 5 stars because it is still an expensive park for the services they offer, since water and electricity are paid. Of regretting the slope of the pavement."
20604,2920991,3,Carcabana,04/07/2023,"Very good location to visit the city but a bit expensive for what it is, it is inclined, it is land and it does not have security fences."
20604,2906245,3,grechnyb,29/06/2023,"Close to old city center, quite parking like a in the forest camping, but without services. For one night to stay is fine and convenient."
20604,2885723,2,mariean,24/06/2023,the charging is not by the minute... we arrived at 2.45pm and left at 11.09pm because there was a show at the neighboring theater... we couldn't hear each other because of the noise... we paid 21.05 euros...
20604,2842413,4,jomamego,11/06/2023,"a little inclined the plots are very tight it is impossible for another one to be placed next to you we played a concert in the theater that was stuck until 3 in the morning we could not rest, in the center very close."
20604,2838962,1,benitocambrin,10/06/2023,"1* is still too much! this car park is theft! A shame ! we just wanted to put water in the van, we had to take a ticket to get back. arrived in front of the terminal, I take out my hose but I don't have a 2€ coin so I can't get water. The time to quickly look for another place, I exceed the 10 authorized minutes by one minute. Result I had to pay almost 1€ for nothing. To flee"
20604,2823859,4,patetmarie85,05/06/2023,Very good area for visiting the city. Sloping ground and very narrow and short places but ok for one night. 23 € per night
20604,2812821,4,thesleepysprinter,02/06/2023,"We stayed here for a couple of days to visit the old town of Cordoba. We needed blocks to get flat but it was quiet at night. Similar price to other places we have stayed however you had to pay for fresh water and there were no toilets or showers. If visiting the old town, we stopped at Horno San Luis for lunch which was very nice - great cocktails!"
20604,2810936,4,HeinzMeinz,02/06/2023,"A nice pitch! We parked here for the night and didn't regret it! It's very quiet (if you park high up) and you can even hear the birds singing. The parking space is very close to the city, so you can reach everything quickly. The prices are rather higher, but in my opinion, justified. Basically highly recommended."
20604,2804440,1,mariarossi,30/05/2023,very expensive and incomprehensible rates !! entered today at 12 and 25 left at 19 and 03 paid 16.35 euros !!!! 6.98 meter motorhome !!!! Strictly parked within the stalls !!!! Shame !!!!
20604,2799152,3,juankein,29/05/2023,"Sloping area, without electricity. If you want paid water, to empty the gray water it is also uphill. The only thing that saves it is the location, that's why I don't put a 1. The Cordoba city council can do much better."
20604,2788501,3,michou55,26/05/2023,"Great place, shaded and not that steep. Accessible to gds cc We 7.30"
20604,2784453,3,sportti,25/05/2023,"€23 for 24 hours, expensive corn close to town. Drainage possible but 2€ for water."
20604,2782867,3,Grabo,24/05/2023,You pay for proximity to centre so it is basically expensive overnight parking. There is so little competition - most Spanish cities only have one campsite or aire de camping car so can charge what they like.
20604,2779273,5,Gironemo,23/05/2023,Good parking space to look at Córdoba / looked at Córdoba for about 5 hours and then drove away again / paid 10 euros for it / space is very crooked
20604,2772024,4,MaRTyENRiQUe,21/05/2023,"perfect location. We went to the fair (25 min from the fair on foot). Price 23 euros per day (it seems a bit expensive for what it offers, which is nothing). Parking space very fair and narrow. Be careful not to get out of your zone with the wheels a few centimeters, they charge you two zones."
20604,2771219,4,gestionarce,21/05/2023,Perfect to visit Córdoba and sleep
20604,2767217,4,Vandiamo,20/05/2023,We are 8.7m & can fit through the gate but there’s only one ideal spot for us to fit as we have a slide out. We usually find we have to use ramps to level the van as it’s a very steep incline. Ideally situated to visit the old town just outside the city walls
20604,2754898,2,lapouche,16/05/2023,2 stars for the position 10 minutes from the old town. otherwise ridiculous pitches for CCs. Pay attention to the pieces of sidewalk that delimit the pitches. The same day three injured therefore a fracture of the fibula. places only for vans and nothing more flat.
20604,2748763,2,Franzydtq,14/05/2023,They are thieves I paid 138 euros for barely 3 days
20604,2726320,4,zetyan,05/05/2023,Narrow location for large sizes (7m50 for ours). we stayed there the time of the visit of the city and to drain. Very well placed.
20604,2723954,5,chrislb29,05/05/2023,"Tree-lined and clean parking, certainly expensive but so close to the cathedral mosque 15 minutes on foot!"
20604,2721503,4,PetraFleger,04/05/2023,"large parking lot also for long campers to use, in the upper part shady next to a park. In the lower part rather dusty. Close to attractions within walking distance. Payment system ok- can not be recognized at times due to direct sunlight. Great place for 1 night."
20604,2717811,5,Nicky73,02/05/2023,"Due to the proximity to all sights and the shady locations, I don't find the parking lot too expensive at all. The fact that you can still drain and toilet waste water there is great. For a caravan 6 meters and with a dog we paid €23 for 19 hours. The park right next to the parking lot is great for the dog to romp around in!"
20604,2703830,2,estherdimi,28/04/2023,"Mada, well, we were leaving 25 minutes in advance and the ticket was not read to us, we called to see what was happening and the lady took a long time to attend to us, for saying something fine, she told us that we had gone too far and that we will pay what the machine asked us for and without giving us another option hung up on us in a very bad way, I gave in and paid but it was already 35 cents Thank you wonderful Córdoba. It's a pity that they spoiled it for us"
20604,2703158,2,pasandvan,28/04/2023,"Very narrow and very short pitches, paying but perfect for visiting the historic center. Arrived early to visit the Cathedral Mosque cool and free from 8:30 to 9:30 and attend mass afterwards. In addition, organic store a hundred meters from the car park. It's rare in Andalusia, we took advantage of it too! 5h = 13 €"
20604,2698208,3,menorko,26/04/2023,parking in the center with shadows there is not much choice so for one night it is fine
20604,2692079,5,ParkMau40,23/04/2023,"Motorhome area located near the city, quiet, with services… For 1 night we paid 23€."
20604,2690197,3,Saskia0812,23/04/2023,"Super central and well located place. Driveway very narrow and directly at an intersection. Gravel parking lot. Appears to be a former car parking lot, as the spaces are very narrow. If there were two mobile homes next to each other, you would hardly have gotten into the Womo. Parking with 7.50m Womo just about possible. Disposal free of charge, refill fresh water with costs."
20604,2688063,3,Quinou,22/04/2023,Very good for visiting the city on foot. Pitches are very tight. Large park nearby. Quiet night despite the nearby avenue. No service except water. Once paid you have 5 minutes to leave otherwise you have to pay again.
20604,2684494,4,norway18,20/04/2023,great for a night to visit Cordoba even though expensive as Services are extra charged
20604,2683537,4,MarionLaulhe,20/04/2023,"For us, it's great that cities, like Cordoba, provide spaces like this, close to the center of the city. Admittedly, the organization needs to be reviewed since the plots are still placed for car parking but they no longer park there! Pitches are clean and shaded. Everyone has enough space, we are far from crowded! Ideal for walking the dog"
20604,2682067,1,schoolopwielen,19/04/2023,"Way too tight and way too expensive. tip: remove the curbs. Cars and vans on the left, campers on the right. Above 23 euros, ask 2 euros for water and 2 euros for electricity. Entrance way too tight. Not a quiet place. Concrete wall with graffiti in the back. City is great."
20604,2671869,4,Croger02,15/04/2023,"Admittedly, very cramped space for parking, including converted vans. But we stayed there for two nights because its geographical position, very close to tourist attractions and right next to a beautiful landscaped park, more than compensates for the parking inconveniences."
20604,2670738,3,ando90mg,14/04/2023,"We parked here to visit Córdoba. The best location is in the center. The spaces are very narrow and not long enough for ACs. We were lucky that it was not full, but I understand the complaints of other users… The price seemed a bit expensive: €14 for 6 hours. The issue is that to park so close to the center there is no other alternative or, at least, we are not aware of it."
20604,2670175,1,potuspark21,14/04/2023,"Horrible, uncomfortable, expensive. Very tight stalls that when it's full you risk getting stuck and not going out. It is only strategic because it is attached to the centre. It should be a camper area instead it is a mixed car park for campers to make a drawer. As if it wasn't already expensive"
20604,2656518,1,Helen0483,10/04/2023,"It's not a motorhome area, it's a parking lot, we arrived on a Saturday and it's crazy that you can't fit between cars and AC, as long as you're in the plots in the middle, you're stuck in a box without being able to get out until some come out, there's pending, the only good thing is the location otherwise nothing. It will also depend on the day you arrive, our crazy Saturday, on Sunday there were more free places."
20604,2656090,4,xixonenc,09/04/2023,"Parking is expensive, but you are a step away from the historic center."
20604,2653037,4,DavidIranzo,09/04/2023,Perfect location to see Cordoba. Great the city of children just 5 minutes walk. Be careful when choosing the parking space as they are small and in some cases you invade the opposite side. Very good charging (€2) and water discharge but bad to connect to the light (we did not use it). A bit pricey but understandable because of the location.
20604,2650333,1,Webkayaker,08/04/2023,"Overrun by cars. It is not really a motorhome area, but a parking lot. Expensive and with great unevenness. Difficult access if you don't know the neighborhood."
20604,2648112,5,andriw1907,07/04/2023,Super good location although a little uneven but without bothering to sleep hehe Filled with 100L for €2 highly recommended
20604,2635001,1,vagabondism,02/04/2023,Water service doesn’t work! It just takes money - but no water. We stopped there just for the services. And I doubt first 10 minutes are free or that the stated price is correct - we payed as if we were there for few hours. So the water machine took my money and at the end I had to pay way more than expected. It’s a shame that noboy takes care of this place but is wiling to put such a high price.
20604,2632567,3,2205,31/03/2023,"23 euros for 24 hours, be careful if you go over one hour you will be charged 46 euros, so you might as well stay 2 days and Cordoba deserves it. 10 minutes from the historic center. free emptying service. Paying water."
20604,2617104,3,ecodada,20/03/2023,"Very convenient for the views, the center is very close. We slept very well on March 17th. With a 6.64 m motorhome, no problem, but we were careful to park it so that it didn't invade other places. Seats are tight and need wedges."
20604,2615948,1,jfdel65,19/03/2023,"Just enough time to visit, expensive for no service, moreover some motorhome owners have paid for 2 pitches because their bike racks encroached on the St square behind the vehicle. Avoid as much as possible."
20604,2612055,4,1kiev2202,17/03/2023,"really good location to visit city center. Pretty safe and easy to park. The price is pretty high, have to pay attention to park in lines, otherwise they will charge for every place engaged. uneven surface but manageable. in total we liked our stay."
20604,2611333,2,travelingsenator,16/03/2023,"We did not know that it charges by how many spaces you take up. We would have parked differently or parked somewhere else. We were charged €70 for parking from 9 PM to 12 PM, 15 hours. Rip off of a price. And it is not advertised as per space, we have a very long camper."
20604,2610870,3,chancath,15/03/2023,"€23 and we had no electricity, you have to stall, that's obvious! You have to stand at the very top near the park there is no noise. It's 5 minutes walk from the historic center, sometimes you have to make some concessions!"
20604,2606294,3,Saradelro,11/03/2023,"Location a few minutes from the center of Cordoba, ideal for seeing the city, sloping terrain although you can put the chocks on, it is not allowed to take anything out in the area. Free emptying, filling 100 liters 2 euros, the price of the maximum daily parking meter 23 euros, quiet place. Supermarket and bakery 10 minutes walk."
20604,2602318,4,Sunshine04,08/03/2023,"The gradient can be easily compensated with a lifting support system. The price should deter long-term campers. Functions. Ideal for 1-2 nights sightseeing. Noisy during the day, quiet at night. Our 8.5 m worked, but no longer is possible. The park above is ideal for dog owners."
20604,2598438,3,JoMarchi,04/03/2023,"Very good for water disposal when in Córdoba. If less than 10 minutes, then also free of charge..."
20604,2595487,4,alejandropoch,01/03/2023,"Narrow entrance, we do not use any service, we only use it to tour the town. Very good location. It was paid in a machine. The price was 0.042 euros per minute."
20604,2592316,3,AntonioPerello,26/02/2023,"I have been 2 nights in a period that has not reached 41 hours and the machine has charged me the price of 2 full days, 46 euros in total. I don't know if he does the calculations at night. The parking lot is made of compact and uneven ground, but with chocks it is solved. Marked spaces are tight. The good thing is the proximity to the Mosque. the water charge is paid. 2 euro 100 l. The rest is free."
20604,2588340,3,Payette1959,23/02/2023,"Arrived at 10 a.m. and left at 5 p.m. I paid €17 and €2 for water but a 5-minute walk from the center For the rest, parking on a slope, acceptable and a lot of dust"
20604,2581809,1,LeftBlank,18/02/2023,"All pitches on a slope and impossible to stand level. In addition, everything is dusty and a bit dirty. The high price is simply not justified."
20604,2579195,3,fabiocat,16/02/2023,"Very convenient in the center. Small stalls for large campers. Free discharge, paid water loading. No current. A bit expensive but you pay for the proximity to the center and the video surveillance."
20604,2572736,3,Gudi,09/02/2023,"The place was absolutely fine for us. However, we have a jack system. We would certainly have had a hard time with wedges. So the place was good, video-monitored and the old town easily accessible on foot. We didn't have to supply or dispose of either"
20604,2572547,1,hasenteufel,09/02/2023,"Catastrophe. Place is so sloping that you can not align. 24 euros and then electricity and water 2 euros each. People the place is really terrible!!! Dear community, please create a pleasant place for us that is also justified in such a city."
20604,2571994,1,pierreafeu84,08/02/2023,attention it counts the length we have a trailer paid 5 places. a shame the parking lot was empty
20604,2568993,3,davidmiller66,05/02/2023,Expensive at €23 for 24hrs (or part thereof). But close to centre. Services are chargeable too except for grey water drain and black water dump. Free non potable water to wash out toilet cassettes. We arrived at 5pm and there was an attendant making note of all vans who take up more than one space. Spaces are not big enough for a >6m vehicle. Only just fit a Motorhome width. Noisy at night.
20604,2568649,5,Atoarredondo,04/02/2023,"What the French who precede me to this comment have paid seems perfect to me, the payment would have to be like this and they would stop occupying what they want of space and time"
20604,2568642,5,sabetdavid56,04/02/2023,Perfect for visiting the historic center on foot. 23 euros: arrival around 5.30 p.m. distributed the next day at 4 p.m. with a Master
20604,2567118,1,Patou52,03/02/2023,"Please note there are widespread abuses, we have a CampingCard with a trailer, all for 13.50m. For 2 nights we paid €230, we went to claim at the tourist office, as we took 5 places (on a parking lot 3/4 empty), they made us pay 5 places"
20604,2561829,1,dinfante,27/01/2023,true thieves! 93 euros for two nights because we occupied two places while the parking lot was almost empty and the places are narrow for wide vans. I knew this car park a few years ago at 10 euros per night and today it is far too expensive and the services are to be paid for in addition. Certainly it is well located but do not exaggerate either!
20604,2556391,1,matthiasbartels,20/01/2023,Great location but the whole place is sloping and the size of the parking spaces has obviously been set with profit maximization in mind. When we left the place after 16 minutes we had to pay €0.65. Are then driven to a free parking lot even closer to the center.
20604,2555547,5,KlausK52,19/01/2023,"So close to the center, a great place, price justified. Any time!"
20604,2554114,4,carlailse,17/01/2023,New Year's Eve stood here for four nights and to our pleasure. We stood in the back so that we crossed with the camper on grass and did not take up two spots. Note that. They are unrelenting. Cordoba is a wonderful city to stay and to walk around through the narrow alleys.
20604,2553824,5,Juanacm6,17/01/2023,"Motorhome parking. Perfect to leave your vehicle well parked, safe and in the historic center of Córdoba. Highly recommended to visit the city. We paid €13.75 for about 5 hours. I don't see it as expensive, the peace of mind that it will be protected is worth it, given the current times."
20604,2550411,4,meheskis,13/01/2023,"69€ for one night…. Huhh… but really close to the center, calm and clean."
20604,2549171,4,chnoebu,11/01/2023,The price is borderline. The location is very good.
20604,2544284,4,Beppe735,06/01/2023,The only negative things are poorly marked and sloping stalls and the price perhaps a little too excessive for what it offers. The location for visiting Cordoba and the tranquility of leaving the vehicle in a video-controlled place are very positive. Quiet night and well lit.
20604,2543012,4,Campinglovers6762,05/01/2023,We stayed for 1 night and having read previous reviews we were concerned. We parked with our 6.9m Motorhome within 1 space but to avoid sticking out too far at the front our rear end was overhanging the space behind. We were charged for 1 slot! The night was comfortable a little noisy but that’s a price you pay for being in the town. Very convenient!
20604,2540399,4,Burgalesas,03/01/2023,"Next to the historic center, very comfortable. The only thing is the price but it is what it is."
20604,2536549,5,marcocappelli,01/01/2023,"Nothing more convenient for visiting Cordoba, 5min walk from the center, loading and unloading services, the spaces are for small vehicles, with vehicles over 640 you have to be careful to park correctly, otherwise you will pay double"
20604,2536300,5,mik71,01/01/2023,"Although it has no services, we give it a 5. Flat, spacious plot, very close to the historic center and above all for the peace of mind of leaving our motorhome in a city without fear. Very good situation both for visiting the city and for sleeping. We do not understand how the City does not make a municipal motorhome area."
20604,2535863,3,Aventuramenuda,31/12/2022,"Perfect for a visit to the historic center. Seats with an inclination, which can become uncomfortable for the night. The place is quite noisy, even at night. Quite high price, although being ten minutes from the center has its cost."
20604,2534979,3,beccyanddan,31/12/2022,"Great location to walk into the old city but not flat, small spaces, would be impossible in a large van in the summer. VERY narrow angles to leave with barriers either side of entry / exit. Not cheap but secure. Free waste disposal."
20604,2534739,2,anderuranga,30/12/2022,"We have looked for the good and the not so good sides of this place. There is a big slope to leave the van, little maneuvering space and we found each plot to be quite narrow. Generally quite expensive. However, it is roughly a 5-minute walk from the old town and there is a small park/field for dogs to roam freely next to the parking lot."
20604,2534662,3,Koala71,30/12/2022,"Ideally located near the city center. Places correct but not very long and you have to stall. If you park correctly, respecting the boxes, you will not pay anything more, contrary to the comment below (we had the rear which exceeded with our 6.40m). Water filling: 2€ for 100 liters! with good flow. At the bottom, it's quieter and we slept very well."
20604,2531754,4,campeobeo,29/12/2022,"Perfect location, in 5 mins walking you are in the centre. The parking is safe and we slept very well. The slots are quite small , for our Van was ok. There is a clear sign at the entrance to park within the borders. We reccomend this place for 1 night to visit Cordoba!"
20604,2528743,3,BernhardKlein,26/12/2022,A perfect parking spot to visit the city. The minute-by-minute billing is also nice. It has nothing to do with pitches or camping. Very narrow spaces. Not recommended for campers over 7 m.
20604,2521829,1,Henares,14/12/2022,"Entry by motorhome just enough, so you don't see the small informative sign (in battery and not online), you are aware of the mirrors so as not to damage the motorhome. It makes more sense to put it much bigger after the barrier and in the parking spaces, but that way you won't be wrong and they don't charge you €69 for occupying three parking spaces in a row (not only me, there are others) and on a slope. The claim sheet is not the official one."
20604,2521341,1,baselunaire,14/12/2022,"Places are very short. The parking lot is large and there is hardly anyone. The slope is steep, and we can't hold on to a single place with our 7m, so we get in the way. In the evening a white car tumbles at full speed, screeching its tires. The guy stares at us. It's scary, we're leaving. It was the controller. We paid for 3 or 4 places. Was it necessary to block the passage?"
20604,2521243,1,Sushielechat,13/12/2022,"The entrance to the car park is narrow for a motorhome, the tree branches brush against our ceiling, it is sloping, it is not ideal for a motorhome. So we stayed for 4 hours to work a bit then left but we paid for 24 hours... I recommend another area or another car park instead. And in addition, the price is absolutely abused!"
20604,2521105,1,AliciaBrown,13/12/2022,A JOKE! we park in low season so nobody and in the parking lot (still gigantic) in length. three places are therefore used. Someone drives past us at least three times and stops in our windows. He takes a picture of our license plate before leaving. we tell ourselves that we are going to pay more and we were right: We are leaving; We paid for all three places!
20604,2517999,2,eleal,10/12/2022,"Because it's the only one there...... very expensive, super uneven, noisy, people outside the parking lot passing by with dogs and running from 7:00. A pity for a city like Córdoba."

Recommended only due to proximity to the center, services and condition, it is very expensive."
20604,2516857,2,MKR,08/12/2022,"Expensive price for a dirt car park, uneven and with narrow spaces. The only good thing is that it is next to the center. You have to pay for filling and electricity separately. There are no campsites or other areas nearby, so you have to die on the stick..."

20604,2502677,2,Deborix16,22/11/2022,"Vehicle: tourism with booth on the roof. They charged us €23/night for spending the night as if we were a motorhome, despite parking in the car park, whose price is €18. They gave us the option of parking there, since there are canvas roofs (to avoid the rain) and the toilets were next door (note that they are toilets, and not bathrooms. There are no showers!) Abusive prices. very central location."
20604,2500733,1,Otho60,20/11/2022,"That price is an abuse, you pay the price of camping with a pool, a few years ago they had reasonable prices and we use it, now not even crazy.

20604,2483900,4,Sinoue2021,05/11/2022,"ideally placed: an easy arrival from the south of the city and the visit on the other side of the boulevard. The price is justified by the ease of access sought and because all possible emptying and filling (2€ for 100l water, remains free). the return by taxi for 5€ from all parts of the old town."
20604,2479968,2,boune69,03/11/2022,"No service, sloping parking supposedly reserved for motorhomes but where there are cars, very noisy (along a very busy avenue) and a prohibitive price. Only advantage it is near the historic center"

The services are paid with coins and there are no people who attend. Everything is self service. Noisy at night because it is next to a large avenue. There are no bathrooms or a washing machine. Only water change and parking. That area doesn't look clean. It's a shame being so well located.

It's expensive. €23 and we haven't spent a full day. If you want drinking water you have to pay €2 more. The point is that since the campsite in Córdoba is closed, there is no other alternative."

The pitch itself has very short and narrow pitches considering the old boundary stones. For WoMo with 8m and more it gets tight. Partly very sloping places, which can hardly be compensated with wedges. Billing to the minute enables flexible arrival and departure."

20604,1844495,5,sandy72,21/04/2022,"Convenient parking for visiting the city, 5 minutes on foot, the proximity and convenience pays off the expense, € 23.00 every 24 hours. Quiet night without noise."
20604,1841625,4,lecasque,20/04/2022,"Not bad in the city center, we spent 2 nights on the top of the car park facing the park, very pleasant!! Small free water point in the park in front of the theater no toilet on the other hand ... and too expensive ... but hey we are in the middle of town and quiet"
20604,1840642,3,oscarDG,20/04/2022,"Secure parking, there is a large park for sports, a dog park and the children's cities are nearby. To visit Cordoba it is close to the old town, Mosque, Alcazar and Roman bridge. For the price you pay 23 euros per day, you could put the water filling for free with the ticket. If you don't want to pay that price, near the Roman bridge there is a dirt esplanade that is safe."
20604,1837921,3,Ragnarelgris,19/04/2022,"We spent three quiet nights, very well located in the center of the city, a 5-minute walk away, against only one emptying and filling area for how large the parking lot is, they should put at least another one and they should try to balance the parking lots."
20604,1835802,4,jabeque,18/04/2022,Water emptying and filling. A good place to spend the night. Very close to the old area. Recommendable.
20604,1832994,4,josemaria27,17/04/2022,"Expensive, very expensive, parking conditioned for Ac, but it is good that they remember us and set up areas as close to the city as these, with a park to take the dogs out and shade in the upper part of the area"
20604,1828865,2,miquel65,16/04/2022,"perfect parking to visit the city, next to the old town, san basilio neighborhood and mosque, quiet place to sleep, the only one but it is the water area, it only works with €2 coins, if you don't have that... , the plots do not have electricity, only in the water area you have 1h also for €2, which forces those who do it to have the motorhome 1 hour occupying the area."

20604,1824140,3,Raiskrispis,15/04/2022,"Perfect location, across the street you are in the center. Next to a green area and several children's parks nearby. The bad thing is that it is dirt, and for the price it should be paved, a little dirty."
20604,1822464,4,lasc,14/04/2022,Ideal for visiting Cordoba we are at the gate of the city shame about the price but really peaceful night
20604,1821567,2,silmg20,14/04/2022,"Great location for visiting Cordoba. Uneven even with shims. For the number of motorhomes that we were, only 1 gray and black water, and they are not included in the price."
20604,1810027,3,Delydet,08/04/2022,"Excellent location, the price of €23 is high, but you can pay with pleasure, the slope is not excessive, the only drawback I see is that considering the price, water change services are not included"
20604,1808468,3,rosmail,06/04/2022,Great location but really very expensive when no facilities beyond waste water and loo disposal are provided. As others have said there’s a lot of easily available free parking nearby.
20604,1795862,4,alexclo,26/03/2022,Beautiful area great for the visit 2 steps from the center and to spend a night. Although it takes wedges BRAVO to the city to think of us and Thank you

20604,1785040,5,ParkPriscilla,16/03/2022,"A city that understands. Good, big place close to the city. Clean and in good surroundings. Everything you need on site or nearby. I'm happy to pay for that! Of course, this could also be optimized here. But great for a big city!"
20604,1784115,4,SiobhanandJack,15/03/2022,"If you're looking for a very convenient place to park for the night within an easy walk of the centre, this is great. It doesn't have any other charms."
20604,1779931,1,crescendo91,11/03/2022,"expensive place, 2 euros per hour. better 500 meters further on free place at the zoo. you pay for this place with your card. people who occupy more than one place are hit twice. So don't stand across. after a few hours we went to stand on the free spot . if it is full, continue unpaved on the path."
20604,1773331,3,FamilyCTAC,04/03/2022,"Perfect place to park to visit the center of Cordoba, everything is very close. The downside that we put is that it is not protected with respect to any person on the street, for the money it costs, it could already be more protected.... also, we corroborate what we have read in other comments that there is a man who calls at your door asking for money."
20604,1772458,4,GIFI24,03/03/2022,"Admittedly it is expensive, €23 24 hours for a pitch without service, but it is in the heart of the city with all the visits, restaurants and shops a stone's throw away. You can't have everything at the same time, so you have to make choices. Next to a park and quiet for the night even if you are in the city center."
20604,1772419,1,mameher,03/03/2022,"€19 for parking during the day for 8 hours. Very expensive for what it offers. Uneven terrain and no type of fence. We parked there for security to visit Córdoba in peace and we could really have parked in any street, since there is no type of surveillance."
20604,1768161,3,Van4life64,27/02/2022,"23€ for 24 hours. Expensive for parking but right in the center and being able to sleep there is an advantage. Park up next to the park for more tranquility at night (on a slope: provide chocks for the wheels) Better not to need water or electricity or to drain because there is only a point at the entrance for everyone .. So it helps to park, visit the city, sleep there and leave!"
20604,1764236,2,JIvan77,23/02/2022,"I give it two stars for the location, which is 5 minutes from the center. BUT it is a VERY expensive area, €24.8 per day or €0.0391/min. The squares are all inclined to one side and are very narrow. You can empty gray and black for free, drinking water is paid and there is only electricity paying where you empty gray. Very poorly designed for motorhomes, with what they charge they could adapt it."
20604,1761399,3,Oozma29Camptastico,20/02/2022,"Great location for visiting Córdoba, just opposite Puerta de Sevilla. Facilities difficult to use as a €2 coin required at the water point. Right next to an auditorium which had live music into the early hours. On an incline so chocks required. Expensive for what is on offer."
20604,1761396,1,bikefire,20/02/2022,"Nothing recommended. Very expensive without offering anything, a lot of noise and no security. In the end it is better to go to the other one that is 5 km away but there is a bus to Córdoba and you can rest. Now it is managed by new owners and the treatment is magnificent."
20604,1758007,2,mgoyena72,17/02/2022,It is very well located. There are no security personnel. last night a man knocked on the door asking for money with an unbelievable story. It is quite noisy.
20604,1755211,1,manuelanu,13/02/2022,"Great location. But apart from that it's on a slope, there is no guard, only cameras, the area is not fenced, everyone can circulate on the motorhome area, it's really scandalous to pay so much for it. Last night a guy was walking by asking for money with a wacky story. To fill the water, payment only with a 2 euro coin!"
20604,1753286,1,MeteoNRuta,11/02/2022,Too expensive for an area. Only as an emergency for services or to visit the city. To spend the night it is better other areas
20604,1752739,4,BKG,11/02/2022,"Perfect for sightseeing and easy to get to. Located at a busy intersection, so noisy even at night. But the proximity to the old town makes that acceptable."
20604,1751889,5,Harpon,10/02/2022,"Perfect for visiting the city, doing a hammam, eating, strolling…. Access for all vehicles apart from a few thin branches…."
20604,1751848,2,ginetteroyer,10/02/2022,area really very expensive especially the service did not include in the package I think that for 23euro it could be included in it very disappointed
20604,1751145,1,YanaPez,09/02/2022,"Services seem to only accept a 2 Euro coin. So we drove into the parking, found we were unable to operate the services and left within 9 minutes, then had to pay 0.40 for the privilege. 100L water is one 2€ coin, 1h electric is one 2€ coin. Parking is charged by the minute, seemingly without grace period."
20604,1748770,3,aluprof,06/02/2022,"Height is not limited to 3.2 m except for a few lower hanging thinner branches. There is only ONE power socket at the disposal. Approaching large mobile homes via the parallel small Avenida del Corregidor. Then you drive almost straight into the driveway. If there is an event in the adjacent arena, you have to expect noise. Noise from the main road until late at night"
20604,1746718,3,Josetxu.1,03/02/2022,"Expensive for what it offers. Uneven that with chocks is solved, small plots for buses and land. It has bathrooms but on the other side in the car area. Very close to the historic center and about 15 minutes from the mosque. If you get up high you won't hear any noise. The best location"
20604,1746407,3,BerndA,02/02/2022,"In January 2022 it is now 23 euros without anything. Very expensive. the city, of course, steals the money from shops and restaurants. The only good thing is the walking distance."
20604,1744563,2,fdmm,30/01/2022,They just raised the price to 23 euros a night. Too expensive and does not include any services. The only good thing is the location.
20604,1742462,4,hapi05,27/01/2022,The location is perfect for exploring Cordoba's sights on foot. I cannot confirm the mentioned height restriction. Our camper is 3.60 high.
20604,1742437,3,hra24,27/01/2022,Very close to the center. But not so quiet and without wedges it becomes a problem.
20604,1738638,3,tornel,22/01/2022,"Very little frequented area. Expensive in relation to equipment, 23 Euros for 24 hours electricity and water in supplements. The only advantage is the proximity to the historic center."
20604,1735557,3,charlesyvette,17/01/2022,"Went in November, indeed we hadn't seen the toilets.. On the other hand, an ideal location for visiting the city center and the mosque. Large park to walk around."
20604,1735395,4,PELATORIO-MURCIA,16/01/2022,"Good, I see that nobody, or at least of which I have read. I don't know you have realized that it DOES have toilets. On the other side of the cemetery, where there is the car park with triangular awnings and which belongs to the same company, there are clean toilets for men, women and disabled people) without showers and they open with a code that appears on the tickets we collect at enter the parking lot. 3 minutes walking"
20604,1735123,3,MaykaMoli,16/01/2022,"It is strategically located, very close to the center (10min walking), but for about 40 hours they have charged us €37...it seems excessive to me, when electricity and water are paid separately! That yes, have a €2 coin prepared xk otherwise you will not be able to use the supplies (it does not accept more than a €2 coin). Close to the highway!!"
20604,1734852,4,BenniBen82,16/01/2022,"The parking space is super close to the center and all sights. It doesn't get any better! Garbage and gray water disposal also possible. 18.50 euros is quite cheeky considering that there is not even a toilet or shower. But Cordoba can afford it! All very tight, but I found the place quite nice with the trees!"
20604,1734562,5,gerardomdz,15/01/2022,"Parking with gray-black unloading area, charging water (€2) and electricity (1 single socket). Very very central, a few meters from the center and a 10-minute walk from the cathedral-mosque. Uneven seats (shocks will be needed). Somewhat noisy due to traffic, park as high up as you can. Highly recommended to visit downtown Cordoba."
20604,1729302,2,akawana,07/01/2022,"The only good thing is the location, very close to the center. The squares are tiny, by car. This survey. Very expensive for what it is, parking and emptying area, € 18.50 (without filling water)"
20604,1729058,4,thylae,07/01/2022,"We spent two nights there, very close to the historic center, a beautiful area with all the amenities a bit expensive but the location is worth it…"
20604,1728457,3,Plaeuskadi,07/01/2022,"the 3 stars are for the parking situation right next to the monumental area. It is a shared car park. Be careful when entering, it is very narrow. It is unlevel, tiny squares for ac, to load water you have to pay with only € 2 coin. There is only one place to load and unload as well as a plug, so you have to wait a long time. it is also very expensive. much to improve"
20604,1725131,4,stefanogiraldin,03/01/2022,"Perfect location for visiting the historic center, correct price it is difficult to find areas like this in the city centers Recommended"
20604,1721945,3,Gonso113,01/01/2022,"The price is really expensive (18.50 a day) since they do not offer services except emptying of sewage and filling of clean ones by paying. Now the place is very good, quiet and the higher up you park, the more feeling of being out of a city. To visit Córdoba, I didn't really break my head."
20604,1721307,4,ripodasventura,31/12/2021,"Payment area, very well located, small and uneven squares. Free emptying, the rest paid. Recommended for visiting the city."

20604,1718294,4,Amundsen3181,29/12/2021,"Very close to the center, in 10 minutes you arrive at the Roman bridge. € 18.5 for 24 hours, loaded with water (100 liters for € 2). Not very well kept (waste bins full) but very comfortable. Had a quiet night. Many campers, there is always passage."
20604,1715405,4,ijp,25/12/2021,"We stayed to sleep, everything was very quiet. There is a drop in the ground. The water drainage was fine. A little expensive"
20604,1712183,4,beniti,18/12/2021,"Our stay has been very positive. We have been in the low season, with very few motorhomes. It takes 10 minutes to walk to the center. We travel with a dog and in just three minutes there is a wonderful park with trees and vegetation with a canine enclosure with very good facilities for dogs to run and play. There are some bathrooms missing and the price is a bit high (€ 18.5 24h)."
20604,1709389,2,mara66,13/12/2021,"Simple parking. I agree with the previous opinions, the only interest is the proximity of the center. Services were unavailable on 12/13/21"
20604,1708779,4,goribf6,12/12/2021,"We have only used it as parking, so we do not value it for the services it has. We parked in the final area of the parking lot and slept level with chocks. It is 5 minutes from the center and spending 24 hours is 18 euros. Ideally, the services will work as a point for improvement."
20604,1708778,1,ligueritxa,12/12/2021,"It is a shared parking with cars! with extreme entrances and ridiculous sized places for motorhomes. not worth it. I put a star for its location, next to the center"
20604,1708592,3,triguerovilanova,12/12/2021,"three stars for its location, in the same entrance to the old town but the uneven plots and services, today in particular it gets stuck, therefore. without service of filling and emptying black. price € 18.50 as if you had services that are not operational as of today."
20604,1707857,1,F.Alvarez,10/12/2021,It is not worth it for the price it has and without offering any service except a mere parking lot. We arrived very late at the Constitution Bridge and taking a walk we found a place without difficulty
20604,1707638,3,anpega2,10/12/2021,"First of all, it is not an area. It is a car park with a perfect location to visit Córdoba, very close to its old town. With a single utility pole it falls short, especially on a bridge where we have been many motorhomes. I suppose that the fact that the Brillante campsite has been closed has further complicated the overcrowding."
20604,1707354,5,Minotavrvs,10/12/2021,"It is located 5 minutes from the historic center, a lot of noise at night. It is quite expensive not to have any service included in the price. € 18.50 per day and it is an open and unguarded car park."
20604,1707138,2,antoniotg,09/12/2021,"I do not understand that they say that there is electricity service, when there is a plug and it is where the gray water is dislodged, Sirs, it does not work for me, otherwise uneven terrain and very short plots, it is true that it is near the old town of Córdoba."
20604,1706775,3,Milimaga,09/12/2021,"The parking is very good, close to the historic center of Córdoba. Be careful when entering because the entrance is narrow and we broke the bulbs of the side lights of the camper. When leaving be careful when paying because they do not give you time to leave, for spending 3 minutes they did not let us leave and we had to pay 0.70 cents, a shame, I know it is not a lot of money but having stayed only 12 hours and paying for 24 because above they do not give you margin of exit."
20604,1706609,3,hnavarro,08/12/2021,"The great advantage is the proximity to the historical case of Córdoba, he reassured at night. At least on the December bridge it was chaos, Cars, vans and Motorhomes parked together which made it impossible to park correctly since Motorhomes usually have a considerable overhang and forces them to occupy part of the rear space."
20604,1706243,4,Kike25,08/12/2021,"It is true that it is not cheap, € 18. But you are less than 10 minutes from the old town, which by the way is huge. € 2 fill water, 100l (yes it is a nuisance that only the machine accepts € 2 coins) Otherwise we were the December bridge was full and we slept three quite quiet nights we have to put wedges because it is uneven. We liked it and we would certainly repeat"
20604,1705616,4,manoplas,07/12/2021,"Very spacious and super quiet area. They usually park caravans / vans and private cars. It is 5 minutes walk from the Alcazar and the Mosque. The price is € 18.5 / 24h, it is quite expensive, but to be in the center of Córdoba you cannot ask for more. It has an area for emptying / filling black and gray water and an electricity connection for € 2 more. You can manage the payment from the EQP APP (equinsapay)"
20604,1705563,2,borjaymaria811,07/12/2021,"The only good thing is the location, small squares, uneven, expensive, filling and cleaning the bathroom costs money, it seems to me a shame about the area, they take advantage of the fact that it is in the center. It is a shame that a city like Córdoba does not know how to value this tourism, it seems to me that it takes advantage and laughs at the world of motorhomes."
20604,1705550,3,AC360,07/12/2021,"Very chaotic, cars and motorhomes everywhere and mixed. Emptying waters is an impossible mission, continually clogged and a long queue at all hours. Very close to the historical case. Expensive for the inconveniences that I have mentioned but there are not many more options."
20604,1704891,2,cortinass,06/12/2021,"The only attraction it has is its proximity to what there is to see. Parking is a disaster. It is a car park where they insist on putting cars that they don't take. It is expensive for what they offer, on top of that yesterday the drain was stuck all day, in the end they fixed it but this morning first thing it was stuck again. I have not been able to change waters."
20604,1702007,2,Mariya80,03/12/2021,"The only good thing about it is the location. Very expensive area € 18.50 for one day. A part € 2 for water and another € 2 if you want electricity. By the way, the machine only accepts € 2 coins. Sloping and very narrow squares. Highway very close, so noise is heard. Difficult entry, we had to go around several times to find it."
20604,1701291,4,Gribouille81,01/12/2021,"Area very well placed to visit the city which is magical. No electricity and very expensive, but you can pay by the hour so we only stayed to visit then went to sleep in Antequerra 40 km away and free."
20604,1700895,3,ginavalli,30/11/2021,"Well connected place with the city is very safe. Although one night I had a bum walking around my RV, but I still felt calm. I don't think it's guarded. There is the arena nearby and if there is a concert you can hear some music ... But nothing disturbing ... Highly recommended to see the city"
20604,1699567,2,MarionaRuben,28/11/2021,"We spent the night there on Friday night. Quiet place, with cozy and beautiful surroundings. Very large AC area. We found it a bit expensive (€ 18 per night). There was a gray water drainage area, but you had to pay a supplement of € 2 to fill the water tank. PS: we recommend going to Churrería Victoria on Doctor Fleming 9 street."
20604,1699422,5,gsusT5,28/11/2021,"Good site. Very central, quiet and with a lot of capacity. € 18.50 24h. € 0.0367 / h. Clean and individual toilets. Separate pouring and filling services (€ 2)."
20604,1698716,5,nancylm,27/11/2021,"It is very well located to visit the old town of Cordoba, a few minutes walk from the places of interest, restaurants and bars. Very clean and very good service. You pay to an ATM, you can with a visa. Care for water and electricity you will need € 2 coins"
20604,1698046,3,Katiova,26/11/2021,"In my opinion, something expensive for what it really offers is € 18 per day, apart from that you have to add € 2 more if you want to fill water and another € 2 if you want electricity for an hour (for which you have to stay next to the pole. because there is only one point of light for the entire parking lot.) You have to give the machine a blow to take the coin because if it does not get stuck and it seems that it does not work."
20604,1694153,2,algado.photo,20/11/2021,"A very successful scam: parking on a steep slope, electricity at the other end for a little while, the rest ditto ... proximity is the carrot, the price is the stick; it's not worth 10 € ... go further, there are places in town if you are not 7 meters ..."
20604,1690728,3,rafaydana,16/11/2021,"The best thing is the location: very close to the historic center. Video surveillance. Unlevel, you have to put chocks. Very noisy if you stay at the beginning. Very expensive: € 18 24 hours only parking seems excessive. Clean water service is paid separately."

20604,1682505,2,molamolax,08/11/2021,"It is a very bad service area: it has no surveillance, it is not fenced, it only has a gray water discharge station and electricity and it is quite expensive. It is also next to the road and the open-air theater, so there is a LOT of noise on show days. The only good thing is that it is close to the center and you feel safe"
20604,1680888,3,lujan400,07/11/2021,"The machine to refuel water and electricity only goes with a two-euro coin, without a telephone to be able to speak with the company that manages the area."

Quiet at night, during the day also some parking cars, but no nuisance. Well lit and with CCTV surveillance. With flot blue, gray water drain and (only) 1 socket. There is a friendly person who keeps the place clean. Despite the heavy rain we had, no mud."
20604,1679274,5,mathetmath,05/11/2021,"Very well. A small flaw: the entrance / exit to the car park is narrow and in the emptying area, tree branches can interfere with high campsites."

We slept well but in the morning we realized that 3 bikes out of 4 had been stolen from us !!! we hear absolutely nothing. complaint filed. I do not recommend it at all, plus the parking does not help us much either. They have cameras but in that way and with the trees ... as if they weren't there."
20604,1667594,3,odreytxd,29/10/2021,"The only positive point is the proximity to the old town. Otherwise, a lot of pedestrian crossing to go to the park, dusty, narrow, sloping ground ++ and finally paid services and very dirty !!!!"

20604,1665668,1,LuciaBarbieri,28/10/2021,A disaster. The only good thing is that there are trees and it is quiet to sleep. An excessively expensive fee and services that DO NOT WORK and (they don't have any sign saying so) are paid separately. A shame that such a beautiful place is so poorly managed.
20604,1665530,3,caruser,28/10/2021,"The good intention of the city council is appreciated, although it lacks electricity. somewhat uneven and with a large park the place has a fair pass if it were not for the high price it has .."

It is behind a theater with concerts, if you go to bed very soon it will bother you if there is a concert, in our case we enjoy it, so very well, at 11:30 p.m. they end. It is worth paying to be safe from theft and trouble."
20604,1659427,3,Sarper,24/10/2021,"Ideal for a couple of nights, it' very close to the city centre but there are no toilets in the neighbourhood. We had enough space to open our rooftop tent and to let our dogs run around the park right next to it."

20604,1654286,3,Zaydaren,20/10/2021,"Very expensive. € 18 spend one night, without anything added, just overnight. Quite steep terrain. Fair enough access to large AC. You have to park in battery, they warned us that otherwise they will give you a fine. Although it is appreciated the city council to have an area near the center"
20604,1648585,1,reisssi,17/10/2021,"Too many visitors let their dogs run freely across the square. Therefore, there is dog excrement in many places, which is difficult to see because of the brown background. You only notice it when you step on it. Good location, but unkempt impression."

20604,1642883,3,vanhomi,13/10/2021,The parking lot is right next to the old town. You pay 18 € per night there. It is checked whether you stand there for several nights! The parking areas are mostly sloping. There is a supply and disposal at the entrance. There is a stadium nearby. That can be very loud. Otherwise the place is relatively quiet. Ideal as a starting point for a trip to Cordoba.
20604,1641799,4,sm4shing,12/10/2021,"I would say excellent rest area. Surely the slope could be a problem in some areas .. but with the wedges the problem is solved. I have not yet unloaded or loaded, I think you pay something for the water load.

There is also no change machine or responsible staff to facilitate it, at least in our case."
20604,1630550,4,amciruelo,06/10/2021,If it is true that it is inclined ... but it is solved well with chocks. It is worth it because it is a step away from the Jewish quarter and the center ... and that is paid ... € 18 / day just parking

20604,1610812,4,JoseAledo,26/09/2021,The price is justified by the practicality and the proximity to the old town. The pitches just lack electricity. But very well
20604,1608104,1,sjmotorhome,25/09/2021,"Parked here, was just unorganised as mixed with normal cars. No set area and a grumpy attendant. Not very welcoming. Went into the city for 6hours and left. Did not want to spend the night as for the price it was to much for the hassle. Sorry, not for us."

20604,1598817,3,SEBAS1999,22/09/2021,"Ideal to visit the center of Córdoba, it is close. The Parking is next to a large shady park where you can relax and take refuge from the sun. We did not get to spend the night because in the afternoon suspicious-looking characters began to pass by and asking for financial aid with not credible arguments. It gave us some insecurity because anyone can walk into the parking lot."
20604,1597955,4,Breithlina,21/09/2021,"We stayed here 1 night, although it is paid, it is appreciated to be parked so close to the center. It seems pretty safe. The squares are narrow but it is very unlikely that it will fill up. There is a lot of shade and the place is very nice. Gray and black water can be emptied and filled with non-potable water (we only use the water for showering and scrubbing)."
20604,1596861,4,AnkeRainer,21/09/2021,"The parking space is quite large and also suitable for vehicles up to 8 meters, this is on a main traffic artery, but it was quite quiet at night on the weekend. if you are lucky you can hear a concert. however, these last until about midnight. it is perfect for exploring the city on foot."
20604,1570012,5,crisesro,11/09/2021,"Central location, you pay for the location. In which city do they let us park next to the old town? There is an auditorium next door, if you don't like noise you should find out the dates of the concerts. Although there are shadows, the heat in Córdoba in August is only tolerated by Cordobans ... recommended at other times of the year."
20604,1569635,2,chiarajacopo,11/09/2021,"Parking with water loading / unloading. Water for a fee, no electricity. Video surveillance but not enclosed by a fence, so anyone can enter. Expensive (19 € / day), no services. Great location for sightseeing."
20604,1566332,2,Consolos,10/09/2021,"We were there this week and the heat was suffocating, in the area the shadows were fair and although it is not attributable to the facilities, I am going to think about it 4 times before going there in summer. Downtown 10-15 minutes walk, the facilities are regular, uneven and give a feeling of helplessness. Anyone can walk in. The best thing is the park next to it, very nice if you go with pets."
20604,1557533,3,AET66,07/09/2021,"Given that there are no other payment alternatives in Cordoba, it is not bad, although expensive considering that the services are paid separately. The facilities are good and the surroundings are well and well connected and close to everything, somewhat noisy but we have to bear in mind that it is in the center. A pity that the people who leave the auditorium use it as a picnic area and loading area. A shame"

We were out for almost 12 hours and everything went well. Quiet place, rest well. The only thing is that there are areas where there is some incline and you have to put leggings. The gray and black can be emptied. Good for the city of Córdoba!"

We had a problem with the change of coins (because the water and electricity machines only accept € 2 coins, take them ready if you need them because it is mission impossible if you look for it at a time / day that the bars are closed).

20604,1037106,3,Etienne56100,09/09/2020,Ideal for visiting the city. We stayed there for one night. It pays off with water service but no security guard. A little noisy because a lot of traffic. For one night it's okay.

20604,1014303,1,BLADE13,30/08/2020,"I have never seen an area as expensive as this, I do not understand the city hall. The most expensive I have found in all of Andalusia and Portugal. At this price I will not return unless rates change."

The historic center is a few minutes walk away, that is its great value. There is no marked parking space for motorhomes, but you can park wherever it suits you best. The upper ones are shaded and are further from the avenue (it has a lot of traffic)."
20604,976987,3,siscuriba,18/08/2020,"Near the center. Uneven squares and poorly designed place to evacuate water. A little expensive. The upper part is shaded, under the trees. Narrow squares. But ideal for visiting the city"

Better to wear chocks because it is somewhat uneven. Clean, very pleasant. You cross the Av and you are on the wall, at Puerta Sevilla. You pay for time like any Parking, you can stay overnight, maximum 17.50 eur for 24 hours. That if you pay just when you leave."
20604,881744,4,EmelineS,19/07/2020,"Perfect for visiting Cordoba, empty in this period with a lot of places in the shade, but many places on a slope if you want to spend the night. Still a bit expensive 11 euros for 5 hours."

20604,794869,4,ScrappyDoo,13/03/2020,Pricey yes but worth it as it’s very central. Quiet night not much traffic. Good place to walk ones dog. Entrance/exit a bit tight as were the parking spaces and the service station. But hey there weren’t many MHs at the time of my visit so not a problem. I would certainly recommend it.
20604,794510,4,montybiker,12/03/2020,Optimal location 10 min. from the Mosque. The worst thing that the entrance and exit are complicated for vehicles 7 meters. The service area is poorly designed.

I parked at the back, right next to a pleasant park with trees. However, the ground is inclined, so I had to level my motorhome.

It does have some shade up the hill, but getting level requires some large ramps.  The were some small vans parked overnight, which obviously don’t have the necessary facilities so be careful where you walk.  An easy walk to the Mezquita, but a much longer walk to the centro which is also well worth a visit.  It was quiet overnight and the car-park guy seemed to wander about which is good."

The problem is that no one in the parked Spaniard pays attention to whether vehicles in front of, beside or behind them are still coming out. So at least the mobile homes are parked tonight, as the space is not sufficient. In case of an emergency, no one can get out. The screaming, hysterical parking attendant, however, thinks this is fine. We hope that at least all cars will come out tonight without having to drive."

Places a little short for vehicles longer than a van. Shadow only at the top and no tarmac area. But all these disadvantages are largely offset by the nearby park which is raised, and especially by the proximity of the historic center, five minutes on foot.

An interview that leaves a lot to be desired ex: emptying K7 clogged and feces that spread on the slab. The price € 17.95 for 24 hours is really exaggerated, plus € 2 for water! The main advantage lies in the proximity 10/15 minutes to the center and the Mezquita. At the top of the car park, access to a very pretty park where the ""joggers"" make their jogging"
20604,532768,4,LOBO-IBERICO,29/06/2019,"Good area, at the top of the whole you have many surveillance cameras and shade trees. the entrance is a bit fair especially if you measure more than 7mts (when turning after the barrier).

And actually for no money (€ 17.95 per 24 hours) when you consider that parking in the center of a large city such as Amsterdam costs € 10 / hour. Nice shade spots. Entry is a bit awkwardly laid out for campers, but doable. Water available for a fee. Enjoy Cordoba"

20604,470627,4,seldarock,29/04/2019,"It is more a parking than an area, but its location is unbeatable, it compensates the price. Crossing an avenue you are already in the historical part.

To use the toilet you have to ask for the key and it is far away, better to use the car. You can fill water and empty poty for 2 Euros. € 17.95 24 hours.

Only downside is the dusty and sloping surface. Also access through the barriers tricky for longer vans but we made it at 8.7m.
20604,435047,3,katy47,01/03/2019,Perfect for visiting the city too noisy to stay more than one night and very expensive but secured by cameras all around and it has the merit of existing because near the historic center that is worth the trip you can not have the butter the money and the creamer we will return despite everything to finish the visit of the city because in a day too short
20604,431807,3,Vandiamo,21/02/2019,"Very difficult to access (we have 9m MH) but easier to exit. very sloping site & we had to park lengthways as no bays could accommodate our size. Expensive but to be expected within a big city. Didn’t use services so unable to comment. Saying all that, it was very quiet & felt secure"

20604,427436,4,jam37,08/02/2019,Perfect for visiting the city and the magnificent Mosque Cathedral of Cordoba not to be missed. Price a bit too high for parking without electricity (17 €) per night but 100m from the historic center.
20604,426913,1,Cicero,05/02/2019,"A star because the place is near the center. Otherwise too loud, bad surface and too slanted. The toilet emptying was very dirty and the price for parking with 0.0359 € per minute much too expensive."

20659,1736774,4,Juanangarcia,19/01/2022,"Quiet place to spend the afternoon and overnight, with picnic tables and nature. If you come from the A-66 you have to enter through the signs for Valle del Jerte, as they say in previous comments."
20659,1703666,4,La_Bicha_III,05/12/2021,"Quiet place, without any noise and without light. Very pretty scenery and some level sites. The rear of the bullring is not visible from the road. Good site. You can get there very well and without a tunnel from the hostel. Just follow the Valle del Jerte road."

20659,1466845,4,bishovan,16/08/2021,"Place away from the town, with lots of shade and flat parking. There are garbage containers and a water fountain. It is a place very busy with cars and people doing sports, but we have spent two nights without problems and accompanied by other campers"
20659,874232,3,txapela_buruan,16/07/2020,"We didn’t like the other parking lots in the village of Hervás and we got here. There was no one, we were alone. The water in the fountain is good, it is at the back of the bullring, and in that place the morning shade is also obtained. No cars, no noise ... we were pretty quiet, even though there was no service"
20659,855248,2,Mayi6857,08/07/2020,"When we arrive at Hervás with the google indications, it directs you towards a tunnel through which a large vehicle cannot pass. Some residents of the town warned us in time and told us that to access the bullring we should go back (500 m) and Let's follow the Jerte valley road, from there Google runs without problems. The place is not bad but very hot, mosquito and little shade"
20659,768415,5,Cantera,14/01/2020,Quiet. There is shade and a water fountain. About 10 minutes from the town on foot.
20659,569293,4,gcrisg,22/07/2019,Good place to spend the night. Quiet. The only thing is that you are somewhat careless about cleaning. People going to picnic at the stone tables in front of the fountain should collect their waste more carefully.
20659,100764,1,Indiocolgao,27/08/2016,Pretty ugly place and also be careful as you have to cross a small tunnel
20659,78752,3,haytor,27/06/2016,"I think it's a better place to spend the day, than to spend the night as it is far from the town and very lonely. In any case quiet with a fountain that everyone stops to catch water."

20671,2039116,4,la_cesar_van,05/07/2022,We spent the night and it was great... Very quiet and hardly any cars pass by... No hats and very close to the center for walking
20671,1870263,4,SigridPokorny,04/05/2022,"very quiet in a residential area. small terraced houses on 2 sides. Aside from me, there were two RVs while there was no one in the other parking lots. I felt abandoned and that's why I slept here. well lit, but unfortunately a little sloping the whole parking lot. It's better in the lower area, but that's where the residents are, because it's in front of the houses."
20671,427380,2,thisisvantastic,07/02/2019,Pretty much bustle and noise for a Thursday night

20691,463160,4,elrafaelillo,22/04/2019,"Quiet parking and a good option for Easter, when the others are complete. Given the time of year we have not had problems with mosquitoes, as it has happened to other campers in the summer."
20691,286070,3,alvaronaga,11/07/2018,"Good place for children. It is a park next to the river with picnic area, park and lawn where to run. The bad comes at dusk that is filled with mosquitoes."

20700,1438451,5,pollogti,11/08/2021,"Individual area (1 space), but there are two shaded parking spaces right next to it. Very quiet and pleasant. The sewage must be disposed of in the cover that is in front of the water intake, it is not marked. I've tagged it with tape but I don't know how long it will last."
20700,1277183,4,LauraiMagi,25/06/2021,"Very small area, 1 square plus another for the waters. But it has a lot of parking next to it, shady and very quiet. Since it is a small town, it costs a bit to get there and some streets are a bit narrow to pass. We parked between the cemetery the recycling area (at the bottom, nothing was smelled) and the area. All perfect!!!"
20700,1103297,3,fbrunner,23/10/2020,Everything working perfectly. Thanks to the municipality.

There is a space reserved for an AC but a lot of parking spaces. Attached to the small cemetery (like. Many of the areas of the villages) Containers of all kinds and everything in order in terms of Waters."

20700,406747,5,Boirense,11/11/2018,We went today to throw gray and black water and everything perfect. It had two tap taps filled with water. To be a small town it fulfills its mission of supplying for campers. I want to thank the municipalities that think about our collective and make us a space by providing their services for free.

20701,1154949,3,Bichen,21/03/2021,"Very comfortable service area, filled with water and very practical for emptying gray and black water, the only downside is that it is right next to the road and has a lot of traffic to spend the night."
20701,1107593,4,fbrunner,27/10/2020,"We only stopped for maintenance. Almost everything working: there was no water on the tap in the place for washing K7, but it was possible to use the other tap without any problems. Access is very easy."
20701,933464,2,AnaOrtega,05/08/2020,"It is not a place to sleep, next to the road. Good place to change the waters. We had no problems sleeping in the town's parks. We had a good dinner at La Barca restaurant in Barrio la Estación."

20702,2169472,4,YAH,03/08/2022,The beautiful environment and with recreational possibilities for adults and children. Inclined parking and cleanliness not very well maintained. There is an emptying and filling area. Enough places for motorhomes but they are not respected by cars. The quiet night to rest. It was recommended to us by a friend from the area and he knew it as the Carixa Recreational Area.

Unbeatable environment with natural leisure areas equipped with tables, children's playground and barbecues. It coincides with the Deza River route halfway between the Toxa Waterfall and the Carboeiro Monastery. I am asking for greater control of car parking."
20702,709709,4,DaPads19,01/10/2019,"Stayed for one night. Clean and tidy parking. Lovely recreation  area - most of it is closed (possibly all seasonal). Sloping parking - chocks required.

20702,681354,4,mpestana,08/09/2019,"The area is fine, with all services for water changes and even a sink. There are about 15 places. It has next to river pools, tables and playground. The only negative is that it is next to the road and is inclined but it is solved with some chocks."
20702,630313,5,joselekun,15/08/2019,The area itself is inclined but worth it. With children it is perfect. Barbecue tables park and natural pools.

The police confirmed that there were frequent break-ins and thefts. It is very unfortunate and pitiful! Park as close as possible to the buses which will ensure your safety."

20710,1160003,3,santiCP,29/03/2021,"Be very careful about getting into town with the motorhome. At the weekend it is a chaos of badly parked cars. The canal streets are the narrowest. If you are lucky to be able to pass, you will most likely get a scratch. This car park is the best option to visit the town and not complicate your life. Yesterday I got in ignorance with a profile of 7 meters and it took me a lot of work to get out."
20710,940309,2,RoseRuiz,08/08/2020,"Very large plot, without shade. They have charged us € 2 to ""watch over"" the vehicle (immediately afterwards the watchman has left). He told us that there was no hour limit so I imagine you can stay overnight. Near the Albufera restaurant and boat rides area. In the village there is also parking on the street."

Park 30 cm next to you and leave the engine running all day for air conditioning and electricity. Of course, just let the wastewater flow onto the square. This is not an isolated case but normality. By the way, in summer and winter (I stop here a few times a year)"

20721,3240837,4,Yeliso,31/08/2023,"It is a luxury to be on the beach, it is very safe next door is the civil guard barracks. It is dirty because the same people in the motorhomes empty gray water and also the water tap there is not for washing dishes or brushing teeth, if we do not set an example of taking care of it, the time will come when they prohibit parking."
20721,3226903,5,tcha3,27/08/2023,"Ideal parking, on the beach, with showers next door. Very spacious for many caravans and vans. There were a lot of vehicles but it was very quiet at night, the worst thing was the heat. It is true that there are wild boars, I saw a javelin with its piglets at 1 in the morning in the parking lot. Be careful, do not leave any rubbish around the vehicle."
20721,3216450,1,viajero.,25/08/2023,"A lot of caution, at nightfall. Wild boars invade urban areas and can be a circumstantial danger. For the rest!, people with good businesses, willing and very professional."
20721,3212610,4,CarlosCaravanista,24/08/2023,"A big parking lot, with a lot of space and a lot of caravans, quiet to sleep, great view and in front of the beach, if you have a motorcycle is good to park there and see the best spots around."
20721,3080232,5,naroa8,05/08/2023,"Perfect for sleeping, seeing that in the entire natural park if it is not an urbanized area they do not let you sleep, a very good option. ATTENTION! From August 8 to 16 parking is prohibited, Fair and concerts in that area."

20721,2992214,4,ccigronlocation,20/07/2023,Great big carpark but busy spot on the beach with water & showers. Beach can be hit & miss with cleanliness - it does get tractored which is great for the sand but the water can be lovely & clear one day & dirty & murky with rubbish the next.  Didn’t have any issues but did sometimes feel a little dodgy as alot of people throughout day & sone permanent campers.

There are public toilets on the beach but with restricted hours."
20721,2882416,4,Tonioga,22/06/2023,"A special place. Close to the sea, level, relatively clean (some users, very few, do not behave as they should), with litter bins. After 12 at night total silence. Angelita Restaurant you eat well and not excessively expensive, very friendly. Do not park on top of the platform, MULTAN. We will return, without a doubt."

20721,2690603,3,Reiziger14,23/04/2023,Don't understand why it's so busy here. The campers are close together and there are people / locals around the campers all day long. The supermarkets have limited opening hours (what is stated on Google is incorrect). On Saturday morning there is a small market 100m from the car park. Beach is nothing special. There is a tap with drinking water. Restaurants within walking distance.

Only downside is that there is a concrete block approx 2 metre wide and half metre high in the middle of the parking area of a similar colour to the ground. The day before we arrived a motorhome had run into the block. It had to be dragged on to a low loader to be removed. Debris was still around, so beware."

There is a tap right in front of the beach. Free parking at least during the time we came in December, it is not suitable for emptying anything, so if you plan to charge electricity and empty water, this is not the one for you. They usually park most are caravans."

20721,1755836,3,miticoarpege,14/02/2022,Sure very busy but like all the other places around here. We thank that they do not send us away and we try not to be intrusive with tables and chairs. We are always inside a natural park.
20721,1752258,1,catetphiphi50,10/02/2022,everyone has their choice to spend the night where they want but here no pun intended by the sea but packed like sardines so we left the place quickly
20721,1747591,4,Dreameraventure,04/02/2022,We have spent the night next to the cemetery. If there was a problem we would have gone to the side where the majority of the motorhomes are located. A good place to start or end the Cabo de Gata park. The town is very quiet in winter.
20721,1744661,3,Mariolan,31/01/2022,"Large, level esplanade, where to spend the night, dumpsters, very crowded, small shops nearby, no services. The Civil Guard advised us not to park in the cemetery area, due to the eviction of environmental personnel, we changed, but they did not evict us."
20721,1743008,5,povilas393,28/01/2022,Big parking lot. Looks like some of the campers live here long time. Amount of campers did not bothered us since there is still enough space to park for the night.
20721,1742896,1,Falvarez.tec,28/01/2022,"What was a parking lot where you could spend the night, is becoming a maxed out camp. Today there would be at least 100 motorhomes. They will end up shutting it down."
20721,1742363,5,etienne,27/01/2022,"completely free parking certainly without shade but in January it is fine. free water and emptying, possibility of having the laundry washed at the ccar area for €3.50 and €3.00 for drying. a Repsol truck passes every Tuesday and Friday morning for gas. A very big thank you to the municipality and above all we must continue to respect the places if we still want to enjoy it for a long time...."
20721,1738405,3,manny_la_belle_vie,21/01/2022,Way too many people. Please note that you have to park in the large car park. we were on the cemetery just opposite and the Guarda Civile came to tell us (very kindly) to go to the large parking lot or to the campsite.
20721,1738008,5,BiddyTheBus,21/01/2022,Quiet place parked right in front of the sunset off season. Many Campers so your feel safe.
20721,1735842,5,Eole39,17/01/2022,Super parking well placed facing the sea without prohibitions. Let's respect these towns that allow parking. Do not believe that you are on conquered ground like this morning a large German motorhome which had connected its hose to a beach fountain to fill a water tank (at least 300 l on this type of vehicle ) without any embarrassment. This kind of behavior does not play in our favor
20721,1735517,3,mimar26,16/01/2022,do not park in the parking lot of the cemetery opposite they dislodged us at 9:00 in the evening.
20721,1727456,3,travelthedogs,06/01/2022,"Spend 2 nights. Beach is nice. Parking with way too many campingcars, even in januari. In town there are some nice little bars where you can eat/drink cheap. On the beach it is expensive."
20721,1727212,5,Rderemoto,05/01/2022,One of the few beachside sites left. Enjoy maintaining the utmost care and respect. We have just arrived and it is full. There will be about 100 BC.
20721,1720898,5,ytxaso,31/12/2021,"I'm not giving it 10 stars because you can't. Parking on the beach and promenade. Very quiet, no noise. Nearby tapas bars and several grocery stores. Perfect to spend several nights. No bathrooms. A fountain on the promenade and outdoor gym."
20721,1716441,4,Chcol89,27/12/2021,"Very beautiful place we stayed there for 5 nights, coming back every evening, many places however we preferred to settle down towards the cemetery opposite, less crowded than at the seafront. Garbage cans, water point, shops, restaurants. Do not miss pushing a little further to visit the Faro de Cabo de Gata and see the salt flats with the flamingos. BP station services at 3.5 km / 5 €"
20721,1714863,4,,23/12/2021,Very good for free parking and accepted by locals and professional fishermen.
20721,1713607,3,Unicore,21/12/2021,"It's absolutely not a nice place (for that), but we always say, if it's cold and dark outside anyway, we close the door and we are comfortable inside ... that's enough, the night between 40 (?!) Other campers in rank and file was calm. The beach is ok, but there are definitely nicer places."
20721,1711838,4,Met0,18/12/2021,"Parking that does not make you dream, everything is closed out of season except the mini-market but it deserves to exist ideal for sleeping a night on the road We were about twenty vehicles"
20721,1711306,1,EGPH,17/12/2021,"I honestly don't know what people find beautiful in this place. It is a camp of campers piled up in a not so beautiful area. We spent the night in the cemetery parking lot across the street and then left in the morning, there is nothing interesting. ATTENTION! Don't buy in the mini markets in the area if you don't want to be ripped off! 10 € for 12 bottles of water and 1 liter of milk! A robbery!"
20721,1710137,5,JorenDroogh,14/12/2021,"right next to the beach where fishing boats are, large and free parking. nearby you can view the flamingos or go to the market or Spanish cafes. nice point to explore the Cabo de Gata from."

20721,1658826,4,oldman65xxl,23/10/2021,"Relatively large parking lot for many campers and cars. Therefore a lot of traffic during the day. The beach is clean if you disregard what the dogs left behind. Shops nearby. Disposal at the Repsol petrol station. Water and shower on site. The description of the place is not correct. There is no public toilet for day visitors and ""sleeper cars""."
20721,1632249,5,Francamo,08/10/2021,"The site is very good. Showers on the beach. The beach like all of Cabo, transparent waters. Next to the town to walk, buy or consume in its bars and restaurants, let's take care of this place to continue enjoying it. Let's be civic and don't mess anything up."
20721,1629939,5,Harry11780,06/10/2021,"Secure parking, very prox. GC barracks, along the promenade, is paved, spectacular location, prox showers. all on the beach"

20721,1609377,4,astrid93,26/09/2021,"The location is excellent, you have the promenade to one side, with bars, a supermarket ... it is true that it lacks a bit of cleaning, but if the people are a bitch, it is what it has ...."
20721,1592707,2,dtau,19/09/2021,Really a great place. Approx. 50 mobile homes. On Saturday afternoon (!) The truck came to empty the waste glass containers. Gone again before breakfast.
20721,1581967,1,RobertoPE,15/09/2021,Very dirty place. We have spent the time to park and start because the smell of urine and fecal water is unbearable.
20721,1578688,1,Martaribas,14/09/2021,"We spent one night. Very dirty, we had to move the camper from place to place because of the stench that came from the first area where we parked. Full of caravans. In the morning the heat hits you, to run away go. All very dirty in the surroundings. No services."
20721,1566018,4,itsusa,10/09/2021,"We spent a quiet night (5/9), the area closest to the beach is usually busy, but there is plenty of room in the parking lot. After reading some comments we thought we were going to find a horrible place and it was not like that. We slept surrounded by more campers and AC. There are showers on the beach and garbage containers."
20721,1560593,4,Chameana,08/09/2021,"Charming little town. We were one day with his night and very very well, after reading the comments I expected it worse regarding the care but it is seen that we are behaving well, I recommend it"
20721,1559168,2,CrilinCrilin,08/09/2021,"To sleep, good. But next to the parking lot it is very dirty, it is the people's toilet. Lots of papers and strong smell. Please do not cost anything to have a potty or a bucket with sawdust for the camper without a sink and then throw it into a container as another garbage. As long as we continue like this and we do not respect and take care of the sites, in the end they will not let us be anywhere."
20721,1524197,5,pilarabad,28/08/2021,"We spent a day with the night and perfect, with the beach in front and close to bars and beach bars very well."

20721,1519131,5,ivanavila,27/08/2021,"All perfect for spending the night with the camper. We were scared by the comments ... But we slept very well. There were a lot more AC and vans, right next to the Civil Guard headquarters. Recommendable."
20721,1511512,4,Rull83,25/08/2021,"We slept last night and everything was perfect, we were not sure from some comments but the truth is that we have not had odor problems or we have seen that the waters have been emptied. The beach is not bad to go with children."
20721,1495596,5,monicurro05,22/08/2021,Good place to sleep on the beach. We arrived uneasy about some comments but it has been a 10. Bar el Cabo 100% recommended.
20721,1475797,1,iri95camper,18/08/2021,"A pigsty, we go by van, the AC next door threw the black and gray ones on the dirt floor. The stench from the parking lot is very unpleasant. A pity, the site is spacious and could be fine. But the people are very sow. The beach does not kill. If you end up here by mistake, at least have dinner at Bar El Cabo, for a few beers you go out, dinner with tapas. Highly recommended"
20721,1475698,1,Trav3ll3r,18/08/2021,"It is a dirty, noisy and crowded plain. The beach is close but not great. To forget."

A public toilet is missing and it would be perfect. It has a paved area and a hard sand area. The breeze has been very annoying at night the closer to the beach the more air but it is a good place."
20721,1396985,4,Jiud,03/08/2021,"Parking near the beach, near local showers. We spent a quiet night with several other vans and motorhomes."

Perfectly leveled, there is only one asphalt half, but the dirt one is exactly the same. In addition, the building next door is the headquarters of the Civil Guard, so you can't be safer."

There is water and now it was also running in January, but unfortunately you cannot connect a hose to this tap. Only a bucket or a watering can remains. The beach is spacious and there are small fishing boats on it, you can see it in constant use. The town was quiet and atmospheric."

20721,1017847,4,aaronaj,31/08/2020,"A recommendable place (next to the beach) due to its flatness and the size of the parking space. Two only inconveniences at the time of staying overnight: the noise of the garbage truck when doing its work and, in our case, several groups of kids who made noise when they returned home from a party."
20721,1015626,5,nurisnuris,30/08/2020,"Good esplanade to spend the night in front of the beach. It was full when we arrived at 10pm, we were lucky to find a hole. During the night the garbage truck woke us up when it passed by making a tremendous roar."

The only problem is that the parking lot is a little disgusting thanks to those people who leave their waste on the ground, from used Tampax to toilet paper. Let's see if we learn not to empty water in non-authorized places. No wonder we are vetoed in many municipalities, and we will find the prohibited sign right away."

20721,481930,4,Fabien14,12/05/2019,Location ok. Facing the sea. In addition there is water available. A lot of camper and van on the parking lot and a lot of passage. We only stayed one night so not much more to say.
20721,477316,5,cocodoum,06/05/2019,Superb quiet place for the night. The village is nice. Direct access to the beach. Excellent sea bath on May 2nd. The beach showers are almost lukewarm and handy. Authentic fishing huts and friendly fishermen who feed the cats. I would have stayed there one more day for peace. Go to the viewpoint a little further is beautiful.
20721,474524,5,MARISATILA,03/05/2019,"We spent the night in front of the sea, incredible views, we did a good bike ride along the road that is there when the walk ends, we had to get off at some stage but we had a good time and we went back through the town. The only thing that we dislike, came to steal the caravan behind us at 17:00 in the afternoon! It's a shame that this happens because they create a great insecurity!"

We slept very well almost do not hear the cars go by on the road, you only hear the sea and we were close to 5 in total. Nearby there are some very nice fishermen's cottages that do not bother anyone. There is also a chiringuito nearby with bathrooms that is open all year.

20721,429596,4,Txema69,15/02/2019,"It is an esplanade of land near the promenade and the beach and I did not seem to be crowded even being about 20, I was left with the doubt is where the poty emptied some ""companions"" but I am sure that in a suitable place rather lifting some chest and emptying and this in the end has its consequences. In short it will also be the time, in summer I imagine it will be complicated."
20721,428369,2,carpetman2301,11/02/2019,Too busy. When parked we felt like being in a poor campsite. No views or space around us. Spent the night but moved on quickly.

Some campers take the right to empty their cassette in a sewer mouth surely not legal. It is these behaviors that will one day take the municipality to prohibit the parking of motorhomes on this place.

Movement of motor homes during the day. I recommend visiting the lighthouse. Incredible sunsets. In the village there are food shops and some open bar (low season)."
20721,421299,5,malcon,08/01/2019,Good place next to the beach spend a night with another 20 motorhomes and no problem next to the town although on this date there is not much atmosphere but better since I suppose that in summer it is more difficult to be quiet. It is worth going to the beautiful landscape lighthouse.

20721,405655,5,Doyo,07/11/2018,"Very nice spot facing the sea This is probably more complicated in the summer, but in late October it is very quiet and well attended by motorhomes. Ideal before visiting the beaches of Monsul and Genoveses (not to be missed!)."

20721,389481,2,sabrina001,07/10/2018,"We are here on Oct. 6. 2018, we did not like it. Despite the fact that in the village a lot of effort has been made to make it look nice, we did not like it. The village lies in the middle of the area with plastic greenhouses. Good for transit. In the season, busy with tourists, now somewhat desolate."
20721,389136,4,sixpack,07/10/2018,"Big place directly at the sea and at the village. Although on the road, but not many cars go through.

How long will it take the neighbors to ask the city council not to allow motorhomes to park?"
20721,342030,3,Txelios,18/08/2018,"Very quiet area to sleep. The air runs and that in our van is appreciated to spend the night. Next to the beach that has a very clean and transparent water.

20721,144597,5,yapagare,21/06/2017,"Very close to the beach, there is a source of drinking water, garbage containers and is close to the town. A good place where they do not put up for parking"

20721,118899,3,katradouz,26/01/2017,"It has the merit of existing given the organized racket that is rife in the region, a priori given the quantities of motorhomes, it is tolerated despite the bans everywhere. For one night, it helps, for the rest and except if you just want to have the beach 50 m away, it's frankly not very interesting."
20721,118857,3,cic1002,25/01/2017,"Beautiful view of the sea, but a ghost town in this season, a little too sad for our taste."
20721,118494,3,lio48mich49,17/01/2017,"I think that before talking about the Spanish who often welcome us better than in France, you should sweep your door. We see incivility from foreigners and I think these people would not allow it in their country, thanks to Spain"
20721,116908,4,mirabelle9,28/12/2016,Magnificent. tolerated for motorhomes. But until some incivilities. It is to the one who will be the most feet in the sand even to hinder the work of professional fishermen. Spanish motorhomes throw their trash out the window. What a pity. Spain is so beautiful.
20721,110577,3,Zztop,19/10/2016,"It was very good last year but frankly the rotten trash cans are too much, too bad because the village is nice"

20721,101346,3,gorka1,29/08/2016,Perfect for spending the night. We arrived on Sunday at 7:30 p.m. and it looked like a camp. People abuse it and then they close the parking lots.

20721,54518,4,rycardo,11/09/2015,"Excellent location, right next to the beach. Many motorhomes. The only problem is that it is next to the road, but it is a road with very little traffic."
20721,30704,3,gerardcc,19/01/2015,Parking on the beach between the village and the fishermen's huts. Tap. Calm.
20763,3049983,1,JCG59,31/07/2023,"Avoid during high season. Lots of cars turning, people coming up from the beach drunk because there are clubs on the beach. We didn't stay to sleep, we didn't feel safe."
20763,1966133,5,AnnaRi91,11/06/2022,"Nice place very close to the beach. There is a restaurant on the way down to the beach. On the beach is a shower and toilets, which are open during the day. Since the parking lot was full when we arrived, we parked a bit earlier on the street and stayed there overnight, although the parking lot was empty in the evening. Good and quiet (apart from a few local residents) place to stay for one night."
20763,1947088,2,boxsters,05/06/2022,Noisy because there is a bar nearby but plenty of free space in the evening. Almost flat depending on the places.

20768,3288642,3,latancheb,12/09/2023,good for troubleshooting but in terms of sanitary conditions very very basic. the same for the dishes. and the way of proceeding for the dubious Elec consumption. the correct locations. well placed to visit around with a vehicle.

20768,3263150,5,bogluc,05/09/2023,Excellent campsite. If you arrive after 1pm the reception will be closed but Antonio will be there to welcome you. Deposit of 20 euros or identity card. I only stayed one night but without any problems. 14 euros (10 euros per van + 2 euros per person). Paid services except free non-drinking water and waste water disposal. Very quiet in general
20768,3252924,5,Lufesa,03/09/2023,"Very good place, we arrived for one day and stayed for three. Friendly staff, good price and Figueira beach, one of the best in Portugal, a 20-minute walk away."
20768,3247714,5,curlylove,01/09/2023,We paid 12 euros for 37 square meters and two people. The WiFi was really good and the shower cost €1 for 3 minutes. It was the best campsite shower we have ever experienced. There is definitely warm water and the pressure is great for a rain shower. Would come back at any time! Can't understand the bad comments.
20768,3167546,1,Stephanemichelet,17/08/2023,disgusting . small location. dirty sanitary. check meter reading
20768,3122833,5,Franvito,11/08/2023,"Very quiet and pleasant place, the owners are very friendly and ready to give any help, we spent one night, a very good price, it has a gray water disposal area and a clean water fill. Showers €1 - 3 min, yes, they are solar powered, if you arrive in the evening like us they will have cold water."
20768,3118943,3,pachoune,11/08/2023,"18.5€ a night with electricity for 3 + the reception which is not very warm, I think it's a bit expensive. I found a way to charge electricity per Kw/h!"

20768,3106500,2,VmSr,09/08/2023,"We went because of the good comments, we paid €13 for a small plot without separation from the ones next door, showers at €1/3min of cold water without any pressure in not very clean barrack toilets, the only point in favor is the beach 20 min away walking and very pretty, for the rest I would not return, the value for money is abusive."
20768,3104168,5,julialopezm,08/08/2023,"Antonio, a very good and polite man, looked for us a perfect place for our small camper. They did not make us pay anything extra for electricity or toilets like in other places and they left us a 3-slot plug if we needed it. €1 to shower but it's worth it if you come from the beaches. The site is very nice with a good sunset"
20768,3100309,5,gastonlecombi,08/08/2023,"Great . Passage in van vw, 1 night, with elec, 2 adults: 12€ (+ 1€ for shower). Free washing machine. Top . A very friendly place, the showers and toilets are very clean. It's quiet. The Intermarché is 5 minutes away. The village is cute as anything. There is everything you need ! I strongly advise it. Blow of heart on this campsite."
20768,3095582,1,Markos22,07/08/2023,"Area with poor access, the owner is rude, we decided to leave because of the bad treatment, at first glance a lot of dirt in the facilities and surroundings... I would never return."
20768,3078050,2,Raphael66,04/08/2023,Good location but I sanction the state and the cleanliness of the toilets (disgusting)
20768,3069663,5,blauerlandy,03/08/2023,We stayed here for one night. Very nice staff. Shower and toilet clean. Enough shady places available. Ideal place to drive to the beaches. We would come again. We paid 16 euros for 2 people for one night. Electricity and shower extra.
20768,3068202,5,pfiddy,03/08/2023,We stayed over at the campsite for one night and absolutely loved it. The staff was incredibly friendly and the space was really well taken care of. Just make sure to have a couple of €1 coins for the shower. Highly recommend ❤️
20768,3053320,4,DavidGferriz,31/07/2023,Right to make a stop. The plots have a lot of privacy with vegetation. The toilets are correct but could be improved.
20768,3051408,5,Darts41,31/07/2023,"nice area. there is wind which makes it possible to support the heat, much more bearable for the dogs. The pitches are well sized and the setting pleasant. good welcome. a superb beach 20' walk away (provide good shoes). small restaurant 5 'in short, a very pleasant 2-day stopover"
20768,3020333,4,surfndestroy,25/07/2023,"Pleasant pitches well isolated by vegetation, very pleasant staff. A good place for a stopover. Close beaches."
20768,3004752,4,Cesar66,23/07/2023,"Many things in favor of this place, the staff is very friendly and attentive to any questions or problems you may have, balanced quality/price ratio, the beach is gorgeous, a point if you have transportation to visit other larger towns. on the other hand, some areas of the dusty floor, and the bathrooms, whose installation can frankly be improved. If you are looking for tranquility and privacy do not hesitate."
20768,3001770,5,Postzegel,22/07/2023,"Not a word has been said too much in the description. It is a great place to experience the Algarve .. from here all places are easily accessible. the campsite is beautiful ... beautiful places, nice showers, and only a 20-minute walk to a beautiful beach ... an absolute must."
20768,2987864,3,HerrWu,19/07/2023,"Small space, free choice of pitches, hedges and trees provide very good sun protection and privacy, friendly staff, sanitary facilities on a simple level, shower cannot be used, camper & 2 adults & electricity = 14.10 €"
20768,2971416,5,mbendi20,16/07/2023,"Privat and quiet camping ground, great setup with bushes in between each spot. Shower and toilet facilites were clean. Located in small village, short drive to beautiful beaches."
20768,2963195,5,RubCar,14/07/2023,"Area with delimited plots although with little shade. They have everything you need including washing machines. The showers are paid. The treatment of the staff was great, especially by Antonio."
20768,2956222,4,rpk128,12/07/2023,"There are beautiful separate plots. The shower costs 1€ extra and there is no toilet paper. Unfortunately, the washing machines are very dirty and you can only use the short program (the operator is constantly behind you and watches everything you do very closely...)"
20768,2953188,4,Girardet,12/07/2023,"Small, well-kept area with pitches well marked out by small hedges. Proper and clean toilets. €10 per pitch, €2/adult, €2/child, €1 dog, €0.50 electricity, €1/3min shower. I recommend"
20768,2950711,4,simoamg1965,11/07/2023,"rest area with essential services, perhaps to be modernized, but always tidy and clean, cordial and friendly welcome. we stayed 6 nights, quiet area, the beach is not very close (25 minutes on foot) but it deserves, I would say one of the most beautiful beaches in the area, precisely because it is not very busy."
20768,2939509,5,isi2122,08/07/2023,"A wonderful place for the night. Showers and toilets have always been clean, a bit spartan (which is absolutely ok for the price!!) but everything you need is there. We received a very warm welcome and were given tips for going to the nearby beach. This is a dream! Can't understand the bad reviews at all. We'd love to come back!"
20768,2933106,2,noroeste,07/07/2023,"They accept caravan. Plot you pay according to size. All services pay separately: washing machine, showers, electricity,... there is no toilet paper, the toilets seem like a block (in every way). Little cleaning in the plots. 100 meters from the area, Aquario bar, very friendly lady and good price."
20768,2925445,1,injy0109,05/07/2023,"Toilets made of odds and ends with recovery boards…, everything is payable, showers, no toilet paper, washing machine and depending on the space, small or large, you pay the price. 1 positive point: it is sheltered from the wind."
20768,2917252,5,Pandavanda,02/07/2023,"Simple but nice little place. We could choose one of the pitches of different sizes. Beautiful beaches nearby, however the maps directions (walking distance) were misleading."
20768,2911404,5,everech,01/07/2023,5 Stars; because the pitch is just super nice. Warm welcome from Antonio and the place owner. The sanitary facilities are simply clean and spacious. We had 2 lovely days here.
20768,2903840,5,AR158,29/06/2023,"We were very happy here! For 8 € we stood a night. For 4€ we could do all our laundry. For 1 € we could shower for 3 minutes. Showers and toilets were relatively clean. The entrance to the site is easy to miss, but you can find your way there. Staff there is very friendly and helpful. We were only there one night and then drove on."
20768,2892016,1,sylvainrch,25/06/2023,"Places too small. No indication to see the entrance to the campsite you get lost. And toilets and showers are disgusting. I do not recommend, photo nothing to do with stroke the site misleading advertising"
20768,2891953,1,kirstenfamilly,25/06/2023,The welcome is very cold I absolutely do not recommend me and my wife and my children walked away so dry
20768,2891802,1,jessicamother,25/06/2023,The toilets are deplorable. I won't put my children inside. There are pipes going everywhere the Christi's are really really. Not up to standard. This is very shocking.
20768,2891010,5,sibylle_holger,25/06/2023,"Very warm welcome, great location: about 15 minutes to the beach, small town with a nice pizzeria, ideal for excursions. Sufficient space, simple clean sanitary facilities, everything works and Antonio always has everything under control. We felt very welcome and would love to come back."
20768,2890891,5,ShuShusana,25/06/2023,"Perfect. We spent only one night with no problems. The entrance is a bit narrow because of a badly parked car. Maneuvering without problem AC 7 m. €10 without electricity. We empty gray and fill clean water. It was practically full of families, children, long-term dogs and not a single noise. It's wonderful to meet people who really respect and know how to behave. Thank you"
20768,2882206,5,jangabriel,22/06/2023,"Very nice place to stay , quiet and cozy . The stuff is  friendly and helpful. A bit misleading to go to the beach , but a very nice beach . Uber to Sagres around 15 and from Cape St Vincent 18 euro back  . From Sagres to Cape St Vincent can go walking , around 1-2 hours but with breathtaking landscapes . I highly recommend even if some of the facilities need upgrades . Overall very good ."
20768,2875651,3,LostKiwis,20/06/2023,Facilities need upgrading. Staff were friendly.

20768,2867977,5,gromsch,18/06/2023,"We don't understand the bad reviews below. The place is really beautiful. Basic but there is everything you need. It's clean and the pitches are big. The reception was super warm, we felt right at home. The road to the entrance is narrow but we easily got through (camper van 6m long). The location is excellent. We'd love to come back!"
20768,2865264,5,GertrudHandschin,17/06/2023,Instead of one night we stayed 6 nights. A great place for our needs. The beach is fantastic (dogs are allowed) as is the area for hiking.
20768,2861115,4,albidg,16/06/2023,"Simple place, nice staff. Cheap prices. Very silent night."
20768,2849264,4,NatiRic,13/06/2023,good reception yes there are meters for electricity but all is in order and it is good to indicate at the entrance of the campsite the beach is magnificent and for the price it is very good
20768,2848366,5,swanamente,12/06/2023,Great value for money and the beach is a dream. Precisely because you can't just drive your car directly to a huge parking lot with a restaurant. The people who give a star here and drive straight on didn't look at the square. The pitches that you see first are the best for a quick night out. Around the corner it looks like the photo. Showers and toilets very clean and pleasant to use. We felt very comfortable through the hedges and the location in nature and the small village.
20768,2839730,5,Vanside_Story,10/06/2023,"We received a very warm welcome from Antonio even though we hadn't reserved in advance. The plots are separated from the neighbors with hedges and bushes, so that you are quite ""alone"". All very rural and cosy, clean and tidy. If we hadn't been passing through, we would definitely have stayed longer."
20768,2836475,4,ellieandwillt,09/06/2023,"Good and cheap campsite, €10 a night in June which includes large pitch, free dumping, free drinking water, Wi-Fi and toilets (showers and electric are extra). Quiet at night, facilities clean and only a short walk to the beautiful beach and lovely restaurants in town. Only 1 toilet and shower per gender for the whole campsite which is not ideal and make sure to arrive before 1pm! Recommend!"
20768,2821189,5,Domiant8786,05/06/2023,"We spent 1 night and everything was great, very quiet and a few minutes from the beach"
20768,2815200,5,LorraineundManuel,03/06/2023,"We paid €10 a night, reception is super nice. And the plumbing is totally okay! The showers run on solar - are logically colder in the morning than in the evening."
20768,2813321,5,samson2019,02/06/2023,"great place, showers and toilet clean, friendly reception. away from the beach quite a long way but scenic and then a dream beach, almost deserted"
20768,2810632,4,PatetCor,01/06/2023,"Great place where we stayed 3 nights, it's like a campsite but with a more attractive price of 10 euros without electricity, with plot delimited by hedges, toilets and showers at 1 euro"
20768,2784300,5,passot9,25/05/2023,"We stayed there for 3 nights. Yes the toilets are rustic but clean, yes there is no swimming pool but the beach is 20min walk away. But for the price of 8 or 10€ (depending on the size of the pitch), you are in a campsite where other brands would make you pay between 20 and 30€. The reception staff are very nice. I highly recommend."
20768,2776381,3,joelponpon,22/05/2023,Friendly but rudimentary area. Good spaces. Attention hot showers at 1 euro for 3 minutes but in fact almost cold water. Electricity 0.50 per KW. Take a good photo of the counter on arrival and departure.
20768,2769698,1,VonWagen,20/05/2023,Gates close at 9 pm and there is no indication of this whatsoever on the website. Arrived at 9:05 and had to find a hiding place in town behind the dumpsters. Fuming.
20768,2765571,3,orchano,19/05/2023,"We have just arrived, a correct shower in clean facilities but very handmade and a bit dilapidated, but fine! Correct plots and separated by hedges that give privacy. Pros: the entrance is very narrow, maneuvering is necessary, the town's dogs bark... a lot, I don't know at night. Three stars…because of the barking dogs."
20768,2748209,1,ReinerReisdorf,14/05/2023,"Photos do not correspond to the place. Super narrow driveway, stray dogs, looked very run down and disgusting. Went straight back."
20768,2740940,1,Mausl13,11/05/2023,"For 1 night ok. Driveway with 7.5m. doable, just slowly. Sanitary a shack, we have not used. Supply disposal ok. Dogs barking all night, reception was weird. You eat well in the nearby restaurant, but look carefully at the bill! We were charged one beer too much and tax (7€) even though the menu said it was included."

20768,2727860,5,RasselbandeBPS,06/05/2023,"Nice space to stay. A 15 minutes walk to a small and beautiful beach. In the village there are a few bars and a small mini market next to a bar. There is a garden on the campsite you can use for BBQ or just relaxing in the shade. Toilets and showers are clean. Paid for a small campervan, one person and a dog 8€ per night. Recommended!"
20768,2724650,5,potuspark21,05/05/2023,Fantastic!! Very kind staff! Advised!!

20768,2680265,5,sanneontour,18/04/2023,"Beautiful, safe and natural place! Detached plots. You are just outside with the dog and by the sea. Friendly and helpful operators. We extended twice and felt very comfortable! We also found it good that no one arrives late and cannot leave before 9 a.m. So you have an undisturbed night! (shunting and slamming doors)"
20768,2679487,1,Rayrapid,18/04/2023,"Very run down, we continue."
20768,2659603,5,JanMennenga,10/04/2023,"Small nice place with showers and toilets. You should not expect great luxury here, but having to pay only 9 € for 2 people + dog (without electricity) is more than fair. In 20 minutes walk is also a super nice beach where there are quite a few people and dogs are allowed. We'd love to come back"
20768,2626847,5,przezyciepl,27/03/2023,"Everything works. There is a machine, 2 euros for 100l (must have a 2 euro coin). You can also pay 3 euros and have water (I think?) Unlimited and dumped."

20768,2593867,1,Braut777,28/02/2023,What are the pictures here have nothing to do with the place ... Everything unkempt and messed up! Dogs constantly barking at night- access only in dry weather.
20768,2585674,3,joe-b,21/02/2023,"access by gymkhana, location just for a 7.50m with trailer and car, visually the toilets are from another time, even cromagnon would not like it. quiet at night no barking dog, just a rooster, nice little park, maintained, average reception."
20768,2579245,4,MarioS.,16/02/2023,"Small, nice place with everything you need. Reception was nice. We even extended it small van for 2 laptops, mobile phones, charge a camera battery and used up some of the light in the car in the evening. Something can't be right! Even if the electricity price is still fair."
20768,2578622,1,volga2,15/02/2023,"Hello everyone. Above all, do not book before seeing on the spot Narrow and chaotic access in a small alley. Very poor place with XXS pitches for van but not for CC of 8.50 with a trailer. Rather cold welcome. Ground not or little maintained and muddy in places. It's a little zone !! Do as we go your way"
20768,2574335,5,Lisadventure,11/02/2023,"Arrival after 1 p.m. possible, official check-in then the next day. Place is very green for a parking space and still sunny. €10 per day for car INCL 2Pax is a mega bargain! Electricity flat rate, great wifi, simple & clean sanitary facilities, great beach within walking distance. We had a lot worse dogs barking. We were even allowed to set up our tent without extra charge. You can always walk in and out. Recommendation!"
20768,2552863,3,JohannaJergens,15/01/2023,"The starting position and the WiFi are positive to mention. Otherwise I would not come back. Dog barking all night long. Electricity is billed according to consumption. Each child, cat & dog costs extra - all in all not a good price/performance ratio."
20768,2551780,1,jezleeuk,14/01/2023,Terrible sizes spaces .. charge per person.. per child and per dog .. be careful it soon adds up.. Shower resemble the toilets from Train Spotting.  Last resort if nowhere else available …Also you get locked in from 7 in the evening until 9am.. not idea if you want or make an early start or have an emergency!!
20768,2551382,2,Alain33440,14/01/2023,"Arrived at 12 p.m. on a Saturday after slaloming between a rotten path and a cross entrance with a not easy 8.50 m in the end, we were delighted that it was full because it is a pile of cc in a very dilapidated place for our taste! !"
20768,2549847,5,ManniMaster,12/01/2023,Little sweet place. Arrival is possible until 7 p.m. Showers and toilets basic but perfectly adequate. Hot water. Walk to the beach about 1.5 km. Great route for a lap with the dog. We found it very nice there.
20768,2542317,4,we.explore,05/01/2023,"I can't understand the bad reviews. Totally cute and very simple place. As far as I understood, arrival until 7 p.m. is possible. After that you won't be able to come back. I took a shower at 9 p.m. and there was still hot water"
20768,2538669,2,ThomasKrebs,02/01/2023,There aren't any major alternatives in the area and since I was there to surf I stayed there for two weeks. I give one star for the pretty good internet and one for the location. I deduct three stars for the constantly (24/7) barking dogs on the square and in the surrounding area. A real dog orchestra. I've never experienced anything so bad and I'll never come back. Promised.
20768,2531306,1,yvesisere,28/12/2022,"One star for the proximity to the charming beach located 20 minutes away by following a very pleasant path. The ""old-fashioned"" side does not bother us but the filth, the flagrant lack of maintenance made us flee. This area is dirty, unpleasant. Without talking to you about the sanitary facilities… Or the reception."
20768,2513808,3,park4nightgisou,05/12/2022,"Everything is a bit worn, needs more maintenance; however the village is there, a decent restaurant without more, a mini-market where the welcome was more than cold ..... not serious the Atlantic Ocean is about 2 km to go on a nice path, paradise for surfers."
20768,2508285,3,RoopsdelaTeste,28/11/2022,very decent space (those at 10 euros). toilets and showers clean but smashed partitions. shower 1eur for 3mn. peaceful place apart from the dogs in the neighborhood but that's the lottery .... ideal stopover before extending to Sagres
20768,2503176,4,ams1111,22/11/2022,"Very nice place. Neat, clean and wonderful staff. They have everything we need here. For us, the only minus was that the sanitary facilities are old and definitely need an upgrade. About 20 minutes to walk to a lovely beach."
20768,2503162,4,FredFlintsone,22/11/2022,"Places a bit small, but sufficient. Spent a pleasant, quiet night. Toilets & showers clean. The fact that you can't drive onto the square after 7 p.m. & the next day before 9 a.m. you can't leave the square with a vehicle because the gate is still closed - deducts a star!"
20768,2490835,4,BrigitteMorgenstern,11/11/2022,"Nice place, shower was too hot and €1 is usually not enough. Beach very difficult to reach."
20768,2482812,4,traveljw,04/11/2022,"It's kept simple, but that's exactly what we like. price is fair. Didn't need showers and toilets. We were looking for a place away from the street. Stayed 2 nights."
20768,2477888,3,bimblebus91,01/11/2022,"Okay site for the €9 we paid for a small pitch with no electric. Unfortunately at night it turns into a bit of a prison camp, you have to have your van back by 7pm as they lock the gates and you can’t drive out again until 9am which is a shame for surfers wanting early morning surf."
20768,2466008,3,verenalmbr,27/10/2022,Okay for one night - unfortunately the sanitary facilities are very poorly equipped and could be better.
20768,2465954,3,PirataDucato27,27/10/2022,"For 1 night it's fine, we slept peacefully. The services and the showers, being paid, leave a lot to be desired. The night clerk may seem a bit unfriendly at first."
20768,2458869,5,Tini2012,23/10/2022,Very simple but really great for one night. The showers cost 1€ and you should have warm water for 3 minutes.. that's not quite true. You need your own toilet paper for the toilets. The pitch costs 8€/night. There are even slightly larger pitches that cost €10/night. You pay for electricity as you need it and there is free WiFi. It is not possible to arrive after 9 p.m.!
20768,2453916,4,albatros21,20/10/2022,"Simple, but there is everything you need. Nice walk to the beach, natural setting."
20768,2451481,5,rafadr,19/10/2022,"We just came to do van service without overnight staying. Staff is nice, everything is clean. Camping looks very nice."
20768,2439103,5,chilo888,12/10/2022,"Good campsite. Gray and black water drainage, drinking water filling included in a reasonable price. Electricity is adjusted to Kwh consumed, that's correct. A quiet night for less than 10€. Thanks a lot"
20768,2437085,5,elvets,11/10/2022,"Very basic facilities but everything you need and clean,relaxed and peaceful. For 8 euros a night (small camper pitch) what more do you expect. Reception open from 9-1, arrive outside that time caretaker shows available pitches and you either leave ID or 20 euros which you get back at reception next day. We ended up staying 9 nights as the place grows on you and we met some lovely people there."
20768,2433357,5,issystevenson,09/10/2022,"Stayed for over a week, for €8 a night the site has everything you need to explore the local area. Very quiet at night and all facilities were clean. Local pizza restaurant is great and a cheap but nice bar right across the street. €1 for 3 minutes of lukewarm shower is the only downside."
20768,2418639,4,ph.fetre,02/10/2022,We stayed 2 nights. Very nice and convenient place to visit the region. The plus is the price. 8 euros for a van and two people. I recommend.
20768,2412284,5,giselaCutanda,29/09/2022,"We went in to spend the night and take a shower, €1. bathrooms very austere, but we got what we needed on the way."
20768,2410775,3,Floris92,29/09/2022,"All services are there, but quite minimal. There is no toilet paper, there was no lock on one toilet and one shower. They seem quite strict; there are many signs with rules."
20768,2398467,3,panontour,24/09/2022,"Due to a lack of alternatives to free standing, we stayed here for one night, paid €14 for a mobile home with 2 people in mid-September. Not a super idyllic place but functional."
20768,2397314,3,ketxa,23/09/2022,"Economic area 20 min walk from the beach, paid showers. The outside door and toilets look like they're from a refugee camp."
20768,2396126,4,AdeFranCisco,23/09/2022,"spacious pitches for 8€ delimited by hedges, toilets to be reviewed, but passable for one night. 1€ per shower for 3 minutes."
20768,2393760,5,july5159,22/09/2022,"We spent 2 nights there, it was great! Very quiet, super friendly and accommodating staff! 15-20min from the beach on foot, by a nice path along the mountain! Absolutely beautiful beach! Hot shower, 3min for 1€! You can empty your gray water and fill up with water for free! We highly recommend this place!"
20768,2389851,5,Betweenangel,20/09/2022,"Very quiet place and with access to a spectacular beach 20 min walk! The staff is very friendly and the prices are quite affordable. €8 small pitch, €2 per person and €1 per dog. We do not contract electricity. Hot shower €1 3 min. Nearby there is a pizzeria that eats very well."
20768,2388444,2,patiu,20/09/2022,I am very surprised by the other comments everything is paying electricity with no check on the meter the showers the toilets place too small for a motorhome of 7.50 everything is paying I did not like fortunately we were able to discover salema a haven peace of mind the descent is very steep I rather recommend the less risky bike
20768,2371593,5,JessKa,14/09/2022,"Highly Recommended! Hard to beat value for money, very good starting point to explore everything around. One night turned into a week, I felt very comfortable there!"
20768,2368360,4,vero06910,13/09/2022,Much better than a lot of camping in Portugal. I recommend.
20768,2355456,3,Bas-Ti,09/09/2022,"We stayed here for one night and it was okay in itself, a bit noisy for a pitch. Supply and disposal is free, electricity costs extra. For €8 a place and €2 per person, that's a fair price. You get a number for your parking space, meaning you can leave your space throughout the day."
20768,2353134,4,LeChrisn,08/09/2022,"Beautifully laid out and made, very comfortable. But everything costs money. Even for a one and a half year old child 2€ are due. Shower 1€ for 3min. The showers and toilets are ok, but built very primitively with wooden panels. Emptying the mobile toilet also costs €2"
20768,2347945,5,Sinapuro,07/09/2022,"A good place to rest and close to the beaches. Very good price and services: bathrooms, showers (you pay 1 and you have 3 minutes, there is plenty, to wash, wash clothes, drain the vans... There are enough places, we arrived without booking. It is one of the most complete areas and affordable prices that we have been through Portugal. You can walk to the town"
20768,2344740,5,Martadela,06/09/2022,Easy and fast to empty and fill water. Good price €3 external
20768,2344152,2,les2fraises,06/09/2022,"Expensive for a simple place (11€, van + 2 adults), without service included (shower 1€, 3min of hot water, which in the end is cold…) no washing up sink…"
20768,2325671,2,Treborvan,31/08/2022,"Your website is very good but it is not like that. Generally careless. It is not worth much except that it is between Sagres and Lagos and little else. Unpleasant staff close at 22:00 and you can not enter or leave with your vehicle. Rates that are not published for everything: children as adults, filling water, separate electricity per kw. It is worth spending one night pitches good but expensive for what they offer."
20768,2323821,2,julesixo,31/08/2022,"Fine for 1-2 nights. Sanitary facilities are ok and clean, but unfortunately the water in the shower, for which you have to pay extra, is not warm. Pitches are good in size. However, what really bothers you are the free-roaming dogs that pee and poop everywhere. Also in the plots. This is absolutely disgusting! Unfortunately, the friendliness of the staff left a lot to be desired!"
20768,2319665,4,VeraResende,29/08/2022,"Camping with good conditions and a beach close by. The changing rooms are different, in a more alternative style but I liked the experience. They have good conditions but if I were to stay more nights I would prefer other conditions. Given the prices it was really good!"
20768,2319451,4,BriaVan,29/08/2022,"Good for stopping, enjoying a shower and recharging with water and electricity, but not much more. Motorhome area with services (shower, WC, waste water disposal and clean water available). 4 stars because inexpensive for the area (12 euros in all with a van, 2 adults and electricity). The place has little charm and some pitches have no greenery. Owner very nice. The showers cost 1 euro, last only 3 minutes and are not very hot. Showers and toilets are very clean. Figueira beach is a 20 min walk and sublime, the sunsets there are definitely worth the cost!"
20768,2319265,4,alextralea,29/08/2022,"We spent a quite night here. Only the noise from the cars passing on the big street was a little unpleasant. Showers and toilets are not great, but alright for the price. We recommend going for a walk to the beach - we took a picnic and spent a lovely evening by the sea."
20768,2317232,5,conchi92,29/08/2022,"Very quiet in the middle of nature, you can be with the dogs in peace. Very economical. The spacious plots."
20768,2298098,4,jule20,25/08/2022,"We arrived here around 9:30 p.m. and it was no problem, in parcel 11 you will find the caretaker who will then show you the free spaces. Very cool guy, he gave us the WiFi password right away. One star deduction because the toilets could be a little cleaner. And no large sink to brush your teeth. Otherwise very nice place with good pitches and friendly staff"
20768,2256147,3,MartaAns,17/08/2022,The place is ok with everything you need to recharge. 1€ for 3min hot shower but the water is not actually warm…
20768,2254436,5,josmadeleine,17/08/2022,"Camping area with showers, toilets, washing machines and dryers, close to the beach. It's a little outdated but ultimately so well located that we put up with it. Reasonable price!! Very cute village of Figueira and sublime and quiet beaches!"
20768,2252477,4,Basislager080711,17/08/2022,Good place. Slightly peculiar entrance. Precise billing of the kWh. A bit dated wash house. But otherwise a very good parking space at the end of Europe;)
20768,2250530,5,furwood,16/08/2022,"Everything you can ask for, well-defined plots and a very good location, very quiet. To put a catch, you can not leave with your vehicle in the morning until 9:00. We will repeat!"
20768,2248220,1,ruslabon,16/08/2022,Very  unfriendly owner!
20768,2217915,5,veco80,11/08/2022,cozy area. in the center of a very suggestive village. paradisiacal beaches reachable with a short walk. We stayed very well.
20768,2211119,4,stela9,10/08/2022,"I don't give it 5* because there were 3 loose dogs peeing all over the plots, and the next day it smelled very strongly of pee. This should be under control. The area itself is perfect. Clean toilets and showers. But please, I also have a dog and the ones that were on the loose even peed on our paddle board..."
20768,2206609,3,jeff60,09/08/2022,"Just for the ease of finding a place for the night because otherwise between the nearby road where there is continuous traffic and the dogs of the village who bark all night long, it's a shame. Otherwise, the pitches are well marked out, there is a shower (€1), washing machine, place to wash the dishes and fill the vehicle with free water and toilets available"
20768,2167471,5,vstrxd,03/08/2022,"We paid €17.70 for two with two dogs for one night with electricity and free wifi (it's very correct), the beach is accessible at 20min on foot, very pretty. The pitches are almost not overlooked, you can fill up with drinking water for free. Dogs must be on a leash, but lovely walks around."
20768,2162554,5,mm1910,02/08/2022,Beautiful place in the middle of nature and relatively quiet. During the day you can hear a distant noise of a street. It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the beach. The sanitary facilities are small but very clean and the washing machines are new. The pictures are no longer up to date. One of the receptionists speaks German. For the price an absolute recommendation!
20768,2162396,4,nautique07,02/08/2022,"Area at the edge of the campsite for a fair price. Very convenient for going to the beach and taking nice walks. We pay for the electricity consumed and 1 euro for the shower, which makes us more responsible! (knowing that we fill up with as much water for the CC as we want!) Pitches at 8 and 10 € depending on the size and 2 €/ pers. electricity according to consumption (50cts/ kw)."
20768,2148241,1,Remmie,30/07/2022,I entered the property and I already had an argument with the owner. Because I hadn't stopped at the stop sign at the front desk. He stood in front of my bus like a police man and then reprimanded me. For your 10 others!
20768,2132157,1,Madinina5,27/07/2022,"We failed in this place at the end of the day because we couldn't find a spot for the night. The caretaker's welcome leaves something to be desired, he is half-friendly and makes grave jokes. The worst thing is that he does not warn us that there are several location rates. With 3 children (including a 3-year-old girl) who pay the same price as adults, without electricity with our 6m motorhome, we paid €20 per night... All this without the price of the shower which costs €1 for... 3min!!! In the sanitary part there are only 4 toilets and 4 showers, which means that in the morning it quickly becomes complicated! I understood better why our pitch stank of wee! Otherwise the environment in full sun without trees and the noise of the nearby road... We saw no attraction to this place except that it saved us for one night."
20768,2127077,5,chrishum,26/07/2022,"Very pleasant area, which is closer to a campsite by the ancillary services (toilets, toilets, dishwashing tray, etc.). Well-marked pitches with little shade. Located a few hundred meters from superb beaches, not easy to access, with clear waters, without crowds, even in high season. Very reasonable price (less than €15 for 2, electricity included)"
20768,2115269,2,licordyerva,24/07/2022,"The site is not worth it, very bad and expensive showers, they close the door at 10:00 p.m. you can hardly see the sunset of Cabo de San Vicente, the plots with gravel and straw. Towards 40 degrees and there was nothing with to cool off, so shower with rubber filling because there is nothing else and the manager wanted me to pay one euro for the shower, I do not recommend the unpleasant manager at all."
20768,2112195,5,laplaya2067,23/07/2022,"Very nice place to spend a few days in the Algarve area. Highlight the kindness and efficiency of Mr. Antonio, who takes care of everything. Any problem he solves for you."
20768,2112187,4,RaquelRocio,23/07/2022,"Great area, quiet and close to a paradisiacal beach (7 min by car). Mr. Antonio, charming, friendly and available 24 hours. The showers is what should be improved. They are clean but the water comes out either very hot or cold (it costs 1 euro)."
20768,2109870,5,jojosch,23/07/2022,"Perfect option considering there’s no place around you’re allowed to stay for free. We payed 8 euros (low season) and 10 (Jul&Aug) for 2 people in a van. Gates are open from 9-21 (9-22 Ju&Au) which you just gotta be aware of before. Showers are powered by solar, so taking a shower in the morning might be a little hot and when it’s dark it can get chilly, but nothing you can’t prepare for!"
20768,2106434,3,xgabimax,22/07/2022,"Everything more or less as described, the bad thing is the showers and toilets, a little neglected but clean and the water is little and cold. Expensive for what they offer."
20768,2100044,2,Alpakasa,20/07/2022,"Convenient because there's no place to sleep around. On the other hand, the atmosphere is not fantastic, the paid showers at 1€ are more lukewarm/cold, lots of rules… in short, practical but not fantastic"
20768,2091709,4,RobSchnei,19/07/2022,"Price and performance go very well together! A rather basic place, but everything you need is there, even washing machines. We could choose from different pitches. Groundsman and operator friendly and helpful. The beach, deserted even in high season, is about 2km away and great. And yes, dogs sometimes bark in the village, but who cares?"
20768,2077438,3,Allan35,15/07/2022,"We stayed there for 2 nights because there are very few pitches in the area, some pitches in the shade, dog barking at night, price of electricity according to consumption (€2.50 on average per day with a plancha, fridge and microwave)"

Either you give the man your ID or 20€ as a deposit. Seats 8/10€, infant costs 2€ extra. Place clean, lots of ants. Could do more with it. Dogs barking at night. Please secure the railing at the bridge to the meadow - so dangerous for children."

20768,1900587,5,T--22,19/05/2022,"Very very cheap place - 8€ for campervan and 2 people. Arriving late (until about 8 p.m.) possible due to the groundsman who lives there. 3 minutes shower costs 1 euro, sanitary facilities top (take toilet paper with you). Electricity 50c per kWh. Everything was clean and quiet, we really liked it"
20768,1899187,3,cham36,18/05/2022,Small and sloping place. A key key. For one night it helps but hey we can do better.
20768,1888116,4,liliane32,13/05/2022,"Very pleasant park. Large pitches in the middle of nature. On the other hand, no tray to do a little laundry and although the toilets are correct and clean, the system for the showers is weird! We pay one euro for just lukewarm water when it flows... lol Beach nearby with lots of nudists."
20768,1880371,2,merkelsihrer,09/05/2022,"In itself cheap and ok for one night, but the place is very carelessly designed. The WiFi was extremely slow and unusable, no toilet paper was provided and the showers burn you as you cannot adjust them. It's a total shame that the potential here isn't exploited. Stupid when you pay and don't get what you were promised."
20768,1879040,4,rubenelia,09/05/2022,"The place is very nice. The evening welcome was very kind and helpful (the morning reception less). You can choose the size of your parking (8€ small,10€ big). If you need to do the laundry, the washing machines are small (4kg) and one of them doesn’t work. It’s possible you’ll have to wait long to wash. The place is very close to the beach and a little restaurant (at 9 p.m. the kitchen closes)."
20768,1867594,5,dan07,03/05/2022,"Very nice reception area! Plots separated by hedges which preserve a bit of privacy, of a good size (we chose a large one at 10 euros). Very quiet night. I don't understand why some are reluctant to leave their identity card there are plenty of campsites that do that, I had no worries. For them it is only the assurance that you will not leave without paying."
20768,1864883,5,marnellix,01/05/2022,"Nice people! Everything available! Great value for money! Sanitary facilities simple but well maintained. If you arrive after 1pm - reception is then closed, they ask for 20€ as security or ID - don't understand the fuss about this in some comments! The place is nice and quiet overall."
20768,1836804,4,sanabria1981,19/04/2022,"very well located, cheap, not to be placed next to the chicken coop, but recommended it is cheap and quiet"
20768,1832815,3,Margarida14,17/04/2022,Pleasant place surrounded by trees. Floor in bad condition especially on rainy days. Expensive for the conditions.
20768,1827523,2,traumfaenger.vanlife,16/04/2022,"very small plots. Sanitary facilities in order. Streets next door clearly heard. in addition, the price of an adult is called up for a 6-month-old baby. the space is cheap, but the performance is also very low."
20768,1827175,3,Alcebral,16/04/2022,The facilities are fine. The bad thing is that you cannot go out with the van from 8:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. in the morning. You can go out to dinner at two nearby restaurants on foot. There is a beach 20 minutes walking.
20768,1818258,4,squakypanda,13/04/2022,"Really great place for the price. You can easily walk to the beach. The manager may seem a bit rigid, but otherwise fine."
20768,1813211,4,randocamp44,10/04/2022,"We arrived late evening. Yes you have to leave an ID because the nice hostess is only present in the morning until 1pm. No particular anxiety about that (there are other ways to usurp your identity, trust me). Correct price 8€ for 1 night 2 people. Very nice walks around the campsite."
20768,1812275,1,klr40,09/04/2022,"Can only confirm that from the previous comment. Apparently he has no interest in taking on customers. By far the rudest owner we have come across. He didn't want to take us in without handing in our ID card. It's a shame because it's the cheap parking space in the area, but then we'd rather leave our money somewhere else. The pitch in general looked nice."
20768,1807371,1,ranger88,05/04/2022,"Wanted to keep our original ID. After we said that this is not possible, he said we should leave. Unfriendly is a bit of an understatement..."
20768,1807000,5,vanito90,05/04/2022,Quiet place to stay the night. 8 euro for van. Reception closes at 13 but you can check in until 20:00 and pay the next day. Free wifi. Very close to sagres to go enjoy some surf!
20768,1806761,3,Stefan3,05/04/2022,everything was very cramped shower/toilet not well maintained is located directly on a busy street value for money not suitable

20768,1784076,4,park4night18273637,15/03/2022,Reception is open from 9:00 until 13:00 each day. As long as you get there between those times then everything else is easy (i.e don’t need to leave ID or anything). Checkout is at 12:00. Gates are locked from 19:00 until 09:00 so you can’t drive out or get back in between these times! (Although you can walk in and out through a locked gate).
20768,1781249,5,okletsgo,12/03/2022,Absolute favorite place. Very sweet and beautiful pitch. Paid 8€ per night for everything including 2 people. So absolutely cheap. Stayed 4 nights.
20768,1773329,2,vickycanelle,04/03/2022,reception open only in the morning. the receptionist only speaks English. in terms of electricity no way to control what we spend. the showers are not hot for long
20768,1772587,1,mervdenis9597,03/03/2022,"Do yourself a favor and go to another campsite. This rude man who supposedly manages this is the rudest, most aggressive thing I've encountered here in Portugal. He didn't respond to calls (during the day) nor did he have an opening time on the web, then he just kicked us out (despite the space) because he didn't want to let us in! ?"
20768,1767968,4,sayradan,27/02/2022,"natural setting, very quiet town, pleasant walk to the beach."
20768,1757639,4,kyo17,16/02/2022,"Please note the price is €10 without electricity, which must be paid on departure. The most annoying thing is that we are not invited to read the meter together on arrival and departure. €5.30 for 3 days (full sun) I find that a bit expensive. But other than that the place is very nice"
20768,1756526,4,Matroos,15/02/2022,"Away from the crowds, this is a friendly and cosy site. A 20 min walk brings you to the secluded beach. Beware however, if you arrive when the office is closed, you have to hand in your ID-card. This is illegal and dangerous. Identity fraud is a serious affair, victims see their life almost ruined. Management must find another way!"
20768,1753597,4,lesclaudes08,12/02/2022,"Very good for the situation, the services.. 1 star removed for the electricity rate (paying according to your consumption) 2 nights with fridge plus TV in the evening plus a minimum of heating (18° during the day outside) hence little need for heating, and all the same .... 19.80 euros for electricity ... so initial price of 10 euros multiplied by 2, or 20 euros per day up to you"
20768,1746822,5,Pierredu14,03/02/2022,good location. price 10€ with electricity. perfect. very good walk...
20768,1739995,5,Andycar,23/01/2022,"Very good area in the middle of nature to relax and get to know Cabo San Vicente, Lagos and other locations. I want to say that both Antonio and the lady at the reception are friendly, correct and always willing to help you. As for leaving documentation, it is if you arrive when the reception is closed. This is the same in hotels. I do not understand why they are alarmed and criticize."
20768,1738153,1,Ralf4x4,21/01/2022,"I was only there for 2 minutes, the unfriendly man wanted to keep my original ID! I said no. He could make a copy for me, or I could pay the few euros in advance. No, he really wanted my ID. We drove back immediately. Guys this stinks to high heaven, never give your ID! You never know what a stranger will do with it..."
20768,1736451,4,xcninayx,18/01/2022,"Campsite with very beautiful surroundings! Beach about 20-30 minutes walking distance. 3 minutes shower for 1 euro. The showers are solar powered, unfortunately you cannot regulate the heat, which means that the water is sometimes boiling hot."
20768,1736146,5,TheWildJourneys,17/01/2022,"Planned to stay 1 night, but ended up staying 6! This campsite is a calm, friendly place, and we loved our stay. We just about fit our LWB sprinter in a small pitch, which, plus our dog, was 9 Euros per night. Which is incredible value!

Also, please note - re. comments about Antonio, he's been friendly and great with us and everyone we've seen! (despite him not speaking English)"
20768,1731054,5,Paisley,09/01/2022,"Central location, nice reception, multilingual (reception open daily from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., afterwards Antonio receives the guests, speaks only Portuguese, but tries very hard to make people understandable), simple, very clean sanitary facilities, dogs friendly, relaxed , friendly atmosphere. COVID-19 compliant, vaccination certificates are checked."
20768,1729743,1,Lambsie,08/01/2022,"Guy who lives in a caravan on site is very rude, very  aggressive, loud, hates dogs and unpleasant towards people. Does not wear a mask and doesn't keep his distance. 
Unwelcoming behaviour.
AVOID!!!"
20768,1728979,1,tz,07/01/2022,"The unfriendly receptionist approached me without a face mask. He didn’t even greet just asked for my COVID Cert which I showed. I asked him friendly if the mask regulation had been lifted. His answer was along the lines that this is not needed on this campground. That gave me serious concerns. Than he wanted to keep my passport, which is illegal. I left immediately again. This place is unsafe."
20768,1725914,5,Hardy59,04/01/2022,"Everything, as already described, is excellent. One of the most beautiful (!) Beaches in the Algarve can be reached by walking through a wonderful valley. The dream par excellence! In the village, in the Rua do Comercio, there is a small shop that sells everything. In the morning from bread rolls to sparkling wine for New Year's Eve. We had a really great week on this course. We recommend."

20768,1703098,4,BiMo58,04/12/2021,"Small, clean and quiet Womo place with large enough parcels! Sanitary facilities, V + E as well as washing machines and dryers, everything was very functional. The electricity is billed according to consumption, the beach can be reached on foot in 1.5 km. The village itself has nothing to offer except a small coffee bar / restaurant, but Sagres is only 15 km away! Recommended !!!"

20768,1693387,1,enteenton,19/11/2021,"On the last evening we didn't come back until 8:00 p.m. and stood in front of locked gates. Luckily a nice lady opened the gate for us. Unfortunately, the ""Platz-Wart"" showed up and explained to us very aggressively that the square closes at 19:00. Nobody told us before. So if you still want to have a cozy dinner in beautiful Sagres (without being bullied), this place is nothing."
20768,1691496,1,berbee51,17/11/2021,"Hot shower only 3min, no control over the warmth of the water Lots of traffic noise during the day. On the day I left they shutdown the water supply because of an problem. I needed to pay 2 euro to use there service station to get water. The small pitches are very the small. The big ones (11 euro) are nice. Good wifi."

The sanitary facilities are clean 2 showers and 2 toilets / per sex but built in the form of DIY (slum style). They are recent but, in the long term, things will fall apart. Shower € 1/3 min. only with the sun and at 5 p.m. In the morning nothing. refusal to reimburse because there is an explanatory panel. Lady in the morning very unpleasant."
20768,1667349,1,melodiejulian,29/10/2021,"When we arrived, the receptionist told us it was 8 euros/night. when we wanted to pay the day after the girl ask us 12 euros because we have 2 small kids...
we have been travelling 1 year around europe, first time we have to pay for a baby! shameful! So 12 euros for a tiny parking without electricity no water. you have to pay everything extra. Dogs are barking at night. not recommend this place."

Ideal for shining towards the Vincentian coast, or exploring the wild beaches around (Figueira, Furnas ...). A small path leads to the beach (20minutes). The village is very quiet, apart from a small bar on the corner (the very rude waiter, the one and only unhelpful Portuguese encountered in Portugal), no shops. We will return to this lovely park."

All very simple but that's exactly what we like. The sanitary area is very clean. The reception is super nice and flexible on top! The proximity to Sagres and Lagos is great. The beach is only 1.5 km away."

20768,986492,4,Raquel.Carlos,21/08/2020,Well located area 30 minutes walk to a paradisiacal beach. At the back there is a barbecue and a very large table with chairs to eat in the shade of two trees. Great stall to hang out. It only has a sink to wash the dishes and the showers are paid. The owner is a bit tight-fisted because he doesn't turn on the streetlights and you have to go in the dark. At night a lot of humidity.
20768,983764,3,calichy,20/08/2020,"Correct area. The showers are with solar panels, the water is very warm and almost cold. The wifi did not reach us until the plot. Recommended if you want to go see the sunset in Cabo San Vicente and move around the area. They close the doors at 11pm. We spent one night we arrived early but on the way back it was full. We spent one night € 13"
20768,979338,3,manel21,18/08/2020,"Access somewhat narrow. It has showers open until 6pm for those who are not parked. Those who are parked can use them after 6pm, always paying 1 euro for 3 minutes of water. It has a picnic area, clothes stall and a barbecue.

20768,915268,3,Netimuse,31/07/2020,"Only area of the zone. A little uneven, in my opinion expensive (€ 12 / night), with separate electricity according to consumption and € 2 to fill clean water. Quiet area in a small town. They close the gate at night, you can enter and leave on foot or even with a small motorcycle."
20768,893107,3,Chemagan,23/07/2020,"Area located near Sagres, Cabo San Vicente etc. Small plots and very fair entrance on both sides. It has hours from 9am to 9pm, then they close the gate with a padlock."

20768,553384,4,Oskarin,14/07/2019,"We spent two nights (1 and 2 Jul 19). VW California, couple with a child 7 years old. Authentic, charming place, it has everything but without luxuries: super clean bathrooms, shower (€ 1) and washing machines (€ 4). Very well located, to a carreruca / walk of a good beach, and in town where, for example, you can dine a typical poultice without ruining yourself. With vehicle you can visit Beliche, San Vicente Lighthouse, Camilo beach and Boneca, cliffs ... To put a penny I will say that it is so rural and so authentic that the roosters will give you good morning without you being able to escape them, but good , is the only noise you will hear (and crickets and leaves moved by wind). I do not want to give 5 stars, but I reserve them for the perfect place, if I find it ..."
20768,541802,5,farinmarscholl,07/07/2019,"Super place to stay, not much money. I paid for 3 people + electricity about 15 €, which is a felt to cheap price. The showers and toilets are clean and the environment is quiet. Only to be recommended!"

Only a star deduction, because the sinks in the bathrooms are a bit small and 1 euro for three minutes showers but is quite short. Nevertheless, one of the most beautiful campsites in the Algarve!"
20768,505747,4,tatttiiii,06/06/2019,At first glance it looks like a somewhat neglected area but its charm lies in the excellent care and cleanliness of the bathrooms. The euro that costs the shower is well paid for this maintenance. We only spent one night with a van for € 8 two people. But we would have spent more if the beach was a little closer.

No animation, otherwise the services are the same except the wifi which is completely inoperative. 2 static buses that distort the landscape, this car park may disappear in the longer term if management continues as it is now what I do not wish of course."

Disappointed that the showers are either too hot or too cold unless you catch them at the optimum time early evening. I washed my hair above an old fashioned clothes washing basin with super powerful hose! Spectacular beach 0.9 miles away. Pierre showed us the path to take to get there. A lovely walk."
20768,312614,1,monicawela,03/08/2018,Only speak English. They charge you for breathing. We only enter to drain the gray water and we charge € 1 and do not put it anywhere the rate of emptying water.
20768,299216,3,apeos,24/07/2018,Area somewhat expensive for what it offers 3 people and light 14 euros shower aside the beach 25 minutes walking though a very beautiful road and spectacular cove
20768,295161,1,Paul_and_friends,21/07/2018,"January 2018: Plant is very simple and although only a few years old, it makes a run-down impression. The prices, see picture with price, I think for too expensive. If you expect everything together, then pay 2 people, with electricity, shower etc. 11 Euro. For the same price level you get a ""real"" campsite with well-maintained squares and modern sanitary facilities."

20768,260693,2,philitineo,29/05/2018,"Hello, unlike the comments that preceded me, I will say that the area seems to be abandoned. The spaces are overgrown with weeds, with stony ground not reflecting the so-called proposed standing. Heaps of gravel, wheelbarrow, stings, damaged barnum, litter the ground on the parking spaces. 8 € with electricity seems to me, not unjustified, but excessive compared to the environment. Wi-Fi is, however, effective. It's a consolation. Personally, I will not come back, you see, good road to all. (Philippe)"

20768,218668,1,el_vago,13/01/2018,"Unfortunately, the already narrow access by cars from residents was so parked that I could not reach the camp. 400m backwards and uphill between parked cars were no pleasure. The curses to report, I save myself. I am 255cm wide, 6,50m long. Urgent recommendation: before entering, check if the way is FREE."
20768,215001,1,vanlifepegaso,16/12/2017,"Camping Raynair. Cheap and shit. Showers 3 min,  1 euro and you are lucky if you get hot water. Small places like in a parking. Camping is near the road, every morning you wake up with the sound of cars. I prefer to sleep in a free parking than paying 7 euros for nothing, or is better to pay 10, for good services.
."
20768,214307,3,TotoIran,10/12/2017,"It is a nice place with a very friendly and helpful owner. His englisch is not very strong.  Everything seems to be a little bit unorganized and the facilities are simple. But there is a good atmosphere amongst the campers. 

Like on the most camping places the Wifi is not very fast. The showers for 1€ just works for 3 minutes. Anoying are the very loud dogs in the village. Even in the night."

20768,181404,1,lavado,21/08/2017,"After spending two days there I have to comment on several things. The area itself is not very bad, but it is quite neglected. Its owners nice people. The problems are several: 1st open until 17h30 'after that time do not go that you do not enter although the owner is there, but he tells you that he has finished his work schedule and that you come tomorrow, I have not been told what I have seen with my own eyes. 2º the services are that they give pity very bad being the showers of payment could fix them. 3º there if you have a light sleep do not worry, the hippies talking until many and when these are silent 2 or 3 in the morning they start the roosters do not fail at 4 are singing and they answer each other. 4th El'accèso with a large vehicle is not possible. Because of all this I would not return"

20773,1418538,5,YannFerreira,07/08/2021,"Magnificent landscape (mountains, rivers, dams, fruit trees, etc ...). As far as camper air is concerned, there are a dozen gravel places and it's flat. toilets and showers are extremely clean. Comfort. The best of the best there is a swimming pool. The owners are kind. You are pampered."
20773,1362306,1,Cocobeloeildeclichy,25/07/2021,"Neither welcoming nor exceptional. if you like to feel free don't go. You are assigned a place and you are forced to put the camper van in the direction designated by the owner. Over time, the service and friendliness must have eroded. Bread baked on site, expensive and ordinary. Showers and toilets clean but swimming pool under the watchful eyes of the owners and their guests. To avoid!"
20773,1340775,5,Baroubigoud,19/07/2021,If you are on the N103 do not hesitate to stop in Vilartao at Fatima and Xavier you will be warmly welcomed. They speak French. They make good bread. You won't go wanting. Thank you Xavier and Fatima we will be back.

20773,857300,5,Bassiebal,09/07/2020,"Very nice place and environment. You can use the shower, toilet (also disabled), washing machine and dryer, a lovely cool swimming pool and a cozy terrace and interior space. They have their own wine, olive oil and honey. A family place! In the area you can walk with 360 degree views, and also visit the village where time has stood still. Work is still done on the land with horse / donkey and wagon. Note: navigation sends you to the village, but this is not suitable for the camper! Follow the blue signs, so do not take the exit to the village, but go straight on."

20773,351487,5,pascalito,24/08/2018,"The comment, Mr JIBYV surprises me, you are not objective. For reading all your comments, it's fine if it's not so good if a tractor, a rooster, a dog and even a transformer make noise. You give a bad image of motorhomes. I see only one solution to your problem sell your motorhome and exiled you deep in Siberia (Pascal)"
20773,351384,5,pascalito,24/08/2018,"How not to fall in love with Fatima and Xavier, everything here invites you to take the time to live and enjoy the time passing. Xavier gets in 4 to satisfy you, a council, a small problem with your camper it will give you the right addresses to repair. Fatima will delight you with its cuisine, its buns and bread baked on wood fire are excellent. (Pascal and christine)"

The kindness and the service are in the genes of this small and adorable family. We struggled to leave (came for one night, stayed 4) but it is to better come back on the return. Brioche, bread and meal at TOP"
20773,341037,5,jess63,18/08/2018,"I am shocked to read such an execrable comment of ""jybiv"" since we have been here for a month and therefore we were here this famous night. We would like to point out that we sleep with all windows and skylights open without any inconvenience. Do not be surprised after such a comment ""jybiv"" that the French are poorly seen abroad. The kindness and availability of Xavier and Fatima is immeasurable. Every morning our owners ask all motorhomes if they need shopping or money and they are happy to take us there with their personal car. Fatima offers on demand homemade bread baked in their wood oven."
20773,338051,5,ninettejuju,16/08/2018,"After 2 stays at Xavier and Fatima the negative comment is not at all objective ... dear Mr next time go on a parking super market it will be free, and in addition you can do your shopping !!!!! In France there is no place comparable to this one, during our stay we did not know the other motorhomes but we all ate and drank together and spent unforgettable moments friends if you were not invited to the party ask questions ! Xavier and Fatima do not change anything you are at the top. Friends camping car drivers do not stop at this comment ......"
20773,337581,5,Josgoldsmits,16/08/2018,I do not agree with the last review. It is a great camper place that has everything to offer peace and cosiness you are forced to merges. Fatima and Yavier are very helpful and help you overall. The French people who wrote the last review better sit on an uninhabited island
20773,334998,1,jybiv,15/08/2018,"The comments below seem to me overrated. If the reception remains ""friendly"", it is not less interested. The calm and sweetness of the place boasted when we arrived is only illusory. By cons if you like being in the middle of nowhere, spend your time between the bar and the small pool, ""galèrer"" to supply you with food, this place will be perfect for you. We managed to sleep between 3 am and 4 am, after our lovely neighbors finished the party (without any intervention of the owner to calm the fervor ....) and before the cock sings and irritates the dogs around . We do not recommend this isolated place at a cost of 14 € for a cc, electricity and two people."

Warm welcome by Xavier and Fatima. Even their dog ""pirate"" is friendly and befriended our little dog during the ride guided by Xavier. Picturesque village nearby.

If you go to Portugal without stopping at Fatima and Xavier, you make a big mistake. They are of exemplary kindness and generosity. For all the services offered you will find no less expensive.

A warm and friendly welcome, impeccable services, very clean, fully equipped, a swimming pool which will refresh you. Fatima and Xavier will warm your heart with their kindness and availability. The meals that you will be served are of excellent quality. Even if this area is not on your route, it is worth a detour.

20773,38818,5,boisso,10/06/2015,"Absolutely sublime, a warm and family welcome. Xavier and Fatima are two charming hosts who are very available and very attentive. All comfort is present, if you are on the road from Bragança to Chaves, especially stop at Vilartao, at Tempo Parou is worth the detour. Time has stopped there. Very good value for money. Certainly one of our best memories and one of our most beautiful encounters in Portugal."

Well defined pitch = no problem of space with the premises very permanently installed & a little noisy when returning but bearable!!!
20778,3125635,3,FallObst,11/08/2023,"A very outdated CP. Many long-term campers, the advertised ""supermarket"" only has a few goods - but there are very good small supermarkets in the village center. Toilets & showers ok, some standing toilets or toilets without a seat. Since we paid almost €20, the price/performance ratio is right here. Completely ok for one night. The night was quiet and we slept well."

Lots of shadows as well as sunny places. On Saturday, there was a live concert from 20 until midnight, but else it was quiet and enjoyable. No disturbance at all.

20778,1890562,1,tank22,15/05/2022,"Huge campsite for long-term campers. Motorhomes are furthest away from the beach and due to construction work there are currently no shaded areas. Also right next to a hall where there is loud live music from 10:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. It's cheap at €17.50 without electricity, but that's about it."

The sanitary facilities are very old and the cleaning lady ensures that the premises are respected... Be careful! There are friendlier places in Portugal."
20778,1785598,2,HindrekSepp,17/03/2022,"no toilet paper. The shower is as it is, no it can be washed. The only good thing is that the beach is next door. Payments in cash only. There is also a thing like a café. Maybe it's in a state that it's not high season."

Clean sanitary facilities, washing machine in very poor condition (not working the first time) arrived at 11 am electricity put at 2 pm, the employee was at the meal. 4 amps, so jump 2 times No hot water for dishes. To report to ACSI I think the control must have passed through."

The campsite works especially with bungalows and campervans are accepted, certainly but ransomed: € 16.95 for 2 people with electricity not counting laundry at € 3 and drying at € 5! In addition, in the morning, the shower was cold and I had nails as a coat rack in the toilets closest to the camper area. Nothing to say on the other hand for the services drain / water except that the place of drain WC is not indicated (treasure hunt to find the unmarked door at the back of the building). For comparison, we paid € 7.10 per night around Porto, with the same services (except the washing machine / drying)!"

20870,2359777,4,JMiranda,11/09/2022,"We went twice to empty and fill with water. Great for it, also garbage containers. Perhaps to sleep it is less interesting, it is nothing more than a large and open cement parking lot in an uninteresting residential area with a road next to it. Still, great to have such a space for AC"
20870,2358976,2,Davcat01,10/09/2022,"Just to fill and empty thank you city. Be careful, large water outlet nozzle. Otherwise large parking lot which was filled with heavy goods vehicles. Motorcycle concentration I don't know for what event but they broke up a lot of noise that day."
20870,2230589,4,txell75th,13/08/2022,We have not slept and it is not very striking to sleep. We have only stopped to empty and fill and everything is perfect. One inch thread for the clean faucet.

20895,1730641,3,RotecGo,09/01/2022,"Everything as described in the declaration, the great thing is the city and the beach."
20895,1708804,4,Sula27,12/12/2021,"The place is simple, neat and well organized. The sanitary facilities are cleaned twice a day. The location in town, right on the beach, is ideal. Good restaurants and wonderful walking and cycling paths by the sea. The neighboring cities of Olhao, Faro or Tavira can be reached cheaply and easily by train. We felt very comfortable and extended it several times."
20895,1703131,1,isifreddy,04/12/2021,"The place is a bad joke! The places are tiny, the campers are close together and you can still hear the neighbor in the closed car next door. There is no privacy here and anyone who likes to sit outside is wrong here. The staff was also super unfriendly. An exit from the square is only possible from 8:00 a.m., without exception! If I could I would give it 0 stars!"
20895,1700593,3,bluesman42,30/11/2021,"Clean campsite with a nice location. Helpful and smiling staff More cold than hot showers. I knew this campsite well in the summer with a good atmosphere between campers. At this time it is calm, very very calm. At 7 a.m., things are chattering and at 7 p.m. nobody is moving. I don't stay there. It does not give a damn. For those who want to rest and wait until the next day, it's perfect"
20895,1694269,3,Ladde,20/11/2021,Large campsite with lots of trees. The large number of wash houses are positive.
20895,1669149,1,asterion,30/10/2021,"To flee ! Extremely unpleasant welcome (check in and check out), impression of being in a reserve piled on top of each other. Positive point: proximity to excellent restaurants nearby."
20895,1621094,4,flosspops,01/10/2021,"Very busy site with lots of full time residents but great position for the the beach,harbour,  restaurants/ bars& shops . Amazing beach with crystal clear water and an area to right past the kite surf shack where dogs are accepted.ferry & water to taxi’s to the island 5mins walk €21 mh 2 people &dog ."
20895,1568842,3,Arlindo,11/09/2021,"The park is good because close to the beach and good restaurants , a lot of dust on the plots"
20895,1470139,4,AxelKnobloch,17/08/2021,"Nice, small family campsite right on the beach. Few shady parking spaces. Sanitary facilities a bit older, but clean. Reservation not possible. Worth a visit."
20895,1449376,2,NolwennGreg,13/08/2021,"Campsite full, impossible to reserve…. With an average reception. We slept at 10min on an old football field in order to be able to return there and the next morning at their request and there always full ..."
20895,1289155,4,Thaize,01/07/2021,"Good Space, familiar and safe! Close to ferry and beaches"
20895,1242605,4,Pipok,07/06/2021,Yes lots of residents but multi nationalities so very friendly. The location is amazing re beaches & great restaurants very nearby. Post total lockdown it was nice to have a relatively busy place with atmosphere. €16 for 8m MH 2 adults. Typical standards for a municipal site. Not the prettiest but very functional. You’ll need to stop at Olhao or Tavira for a big supermarket. We’ll be back.
20895,1214406,4,Margadira,23/05/2021,"The park is very nice and well located, but in May (low season and pandemic) it is almost complete with resident caravans."
20895,1118960,1,vickster896,02/12/2020,We stayed for four nights. The place is almost completely full of elderly long term vans. Think shanty town meets Benidorm. Many spend all their time drinking and don’t leave the site. On the third night we were literally attacked by a drunken woman from Lithuania. We complained to staff and moved to another pitch. This was in the middle of the shanty town area so we left the next day. This could be an incredible place if they limited the length of the stay and stopped serving alcohol to drunks. Many people were not following covid rules even when there was covid in the camp
20895,1112457,1,Arnoar,05/11/2020,"It is impossible to provide services (water, WC) without spending at least one night there. Regrettable, especially as the locations are cramped and without any charm. The only advantage: the nearby beach, a small paradisiacal bay protected from the waves of the sea. For your laundry, prefer the laundromat located in the city, to the right of the campsite up along the road, half the cost."
20895,1091509,4,tito42,12/10/2020,Parking often full. We called to book late (8pm maximum). Clean toilet and showers. Shops and restaurants nearby. 17 € for 2 people a van and electricity.
20895,1085635,1,larolette85,08/10/2020,Please note 2020 prices: price for a motorcycle trailer € 3.10 (free in previous years). Price change also for different seasons. We will not be returning customers for 8 years.
20895,991999,5,jeanpierre55,22/08/2020,"Nice campsite in summer and winter, shops, beach and restaurants nearby on foot, however, often full phone before I go there every time I visit"
20895,864413,5,Saragarsan,12/07/2020,"Great location of the campsite, many shady areas, services are not bad."
20895,786060,3,IvanilTerribile,24/02/2020,"Municipal campground full, asked to unload and refuel the attendant looked at me horrified as if I had a bad disease. Stopped in the parking lot after camping with other campers no problem. I like Fuseta as a town, but pleasure is subjective, maybe others don't like it"
20895,785404,5,waynesmith,23/02/2020,"Great location, the site was clean, many long term vans. Beach just over the road. Tight site but we would stay again."
20895,755500,5,wicklow86,21/12/2019,"Very good campsite. Showers and toilets a little dated but worked well
 - very powerful shower. Plenty of pitches available. Was very quiet considering we had neighbours all around. Friendly welcome and reception were helpful. Would stay again, €15 on a large pitch with electric."
20895,749989,1,gege31,04/12/2019,"I continue (saw that it is impossible to make a change) the WiFi c lamentable, with a L ..."
20895,749983,5,1050120,04/12/2019,"Hello everyone, I can understand that for some people the old ones by their camps water bottles etc etc ... it's a well deserved rest they worked all their lives so do not be mean your turn will come and you also one day you will be retired !!! cordially. Jack"
20895,747178,1,enrouelibre,25/11/2019,"Nullissime and beaufissime. Piled in the middle of long-term residents and their ""fences"" of water cans, a washing machine for a hundred seats, music at the bottom right next Monday evening end of November (information taken at the reception, it is a Zumba class ...). I envy those who are parked quiet for free a few hundred meters from here, on a large car park at the edge of the sea ... Go your way!"
20895,746292,4,nemo11,23/11/2019,"Very well located, close to the sea and the city center, a little small sites, a lot of sedentary French suddenly it does not travel damage"
20895,720203,1,gentlejim,13/10/2019,"- Horror: loud-tight-comic mood, I drove to the parking lot at the Isla Tarifa"
20895,716836,3,larolette85,09/10/2019,"Good camping, correct home, reduced sites, old but clean sanitary. The new block more modern but very small cabins (shower and toilet). Attention september often complete a lot of old people, a lot of French who think to be at home. Location of the campsite top: beach, trade, port all on foot. Quality price ratio correct."
20895,707273,1,JOJO17,28/09/2019,September 28 and complete by people who live there year-round.
20895,696222,3,Samipa,18/09/2019,"The campsite is ok for the price, as it offers everything needed to clean up when passing through. However, it seems somehow uncomfortable: tight, stones, little green in September, somehow parched. The food in the restaurant does not taste so good. The whole place looks like a pensioner's paradise."
20895,693235,5,Nadanjo,16/09/2019,"Relatively ""tight"", but otherwise perfect for the price! Since the staff changed constantly, I can not confirm the rudeness by any means. If you want a service, proper toilets and hot showers, is here in good hands! :)"
20895,684989,5,Chipie92,10/09/2019,We had to stay for one night we stayed 2. Everything on the spot. € 15 for 1moto CC and 2 adults. Near the village and the sea. Numerous trips to the sea. 3.09.2019
20895,684261,4,Kayastur,10/09/2019,"Good camping at a great price. Near the beach and the harbor. Fuseta is not much to visit but it is very Agustí, you eat good fresh fish at a great price and you have a beach next to the campsite. You can also take a ferry for € 1.80 round trip, to go to another beach much better."
20895,673169,4,cadytu,02/09/2019,"Good camping and cheap. In August € 28 two nights, 2 adults and camper. There is noise from outside, but at 12 at night everything is calm and you can sleep well. Correct bathrooms and showers. Correct plots, although with little shade. Those with shade are occupied by fixed caravans."
20895,545310,4,Xuacu,09/07/2019,"We spent 5 days in April, without problem of site. Very quiet near the center of town and the Ferries."
20895,537979,4,roulottegard,03/07/2019,"For a Municipal campsite, it is very correct (price, health, home) by cons places are limited. It is open year-round, many people live there .... All amenities are on site, the train to visit the Algarve, and on the port offers Taxis boats to make the Islands, and cayak. Access to the beach 2min. A good price-performance ratio."
20895,443917,4,jkotti,24/03/2019,"Great place, the lively village, the beach and various cafes and restaurants are close to the campsite. With us the staff was very friendly and helpful. 16.00 Euro for a 7 meter mobile home, 2 people, 1 dog and electricity we found absolutely ok. From the 7th day it will be even cheaper. We recommend!"
20895,430433,3,melbarouf,17/02/2019,"Clean and good walk 2 day stop for linen and shower. very good if only if you are under 50 do not expect the usability described in the comments. our arrival: 2 thirties with 2 dogs to completely panic and worry many of our neighbors who, say it might be better in an EPAD ??? yeah it's more expensive"
20895,424786,3,Tongden,26/01/2019,Good and cheap place. Friendliness at the front desk is partly expandable! WiFi reception can be down for days.
20895,421576,4,mirabelle9,10/01/2019,I love Fuseta. Charm and sweetness of life. camping !! In winter retirement home for many French people. Regulars who recrait their village. Feeling of suffocation in my opinion. Has the merit of existing.
20895,412124,4,vintageb3,05/12/2018,"Well run site. Tidy. Showers and toilets clean. Chemical toilet dump very clean. Secure site as its gated. We found the staff very friendly and helpful. Spoke good English. 10 Amp power. Noisy bar across road, quiet by 10.00pm."
20895,411810,4,Calibee2018,04/12/2018,Excellent camping with everything you need. Village reachable in a few steps. Shopping in the village. Sanitary very close toilet otherwise OK.
20895,410803,5,annsarner,29/11/2018,"A lot must have happened since the description from 2015. The staff is friendly and communicates in many languages. Wifi is not perfect but ok all over the camping. The beach, the fishing harbour, the little village, so alive even in winter, with cafes, shops and restaurants. Alive not because of the tourists, but because portuguese people live here ! We loved it here. Normally we get a little itchy after a couple of nights at a place. We stayed for three weeks !"
20895,407564,4,valounet007,15/11/2018,"Nice campsite located near the city center. The toilets are clean, the staff speaks several languages ​​including French. The only problem, a lot of French so not very exotic."
20895,401438,4,AlanStewart,30/10/2018,"Great place and all staff once you get to know them are great. Remember, this is a local municipal campsite run by local Portugal people. Just a note: there is no height limit in campsite but there are trees so take care"
20895,398303,5,bozoducato,24/10/2018,"Home always so friendly (it changes some Spanish campsite) very well located everything can be done on foot, beach, restaurant, race ..."
20895,389303,5,HansCardenas,07/10/2018,"Great, great. Large plots. Super clean services, the magnificent bar, plenty of shade. Very frequent garbage collection service, there are many plots taken by long-term customers, light poster very well prepared. The wifi leaves something to be desired but it is all over the campsite. The staff very correct. Very quiet place and one minute from the beach. I recommend the restaurants next to the municipal market (on the river)."
20895,386253,4,blanc.carole,02/10/2018,"Modest campsite (and therefore not expensive at all) actually very well placed with all the amenities accessible on foot, beach, village, shops, restaurants. Had a very enjoyable week."
20895,385354,4,gig34i,30/09/2018,"Nice campsite very populated because close to a beautiful beach at the edge of the lagoon and a friendly village. Plots small but shady, very nice reception of the two holders, good atmosphere."
20895,378015,4,skyontheroad,20/09/2018,"Having in mind one is in the Algarve, 100 meters from the beach or the ferry that travels to Armona island and a motorhome, 2 people, a dog and power supply is around €17 a night, the place is great. Don't know what toilets and showers look like - we have a motorhome, not a tent. The pitchs vary from exposed to quite private, depends on what you can find available. There's a service point for motorhomes, a minimarket and a restaurant on site. Quite during the night."
20895,374142,3,vanvanyr,15/09/2018,"Actually simple camping, small and very tight location but it is 100 m from the beach and the village. Important Info, it offers recharging of propane cylinders."
20895,373661,4,guezys,14/09/2018,Clean. Well located. Correct price. Good welcome
20895,366936,1,Arlindomasp,07/09/2018,Cleaning ladies are not at all amiable They are upset They should be trained to talk to customers
20895,366566,2,Arlindomasp,06/09/2018,Plots very tight and full of dust only good thing is seaside and village center
20895,357193,1,libetxu13,28/08/2018,We arrived at 10pm and the only place left was a dwarf plot with the sink in half and the trash there as well. As we were tired we decided to stay. The staff that attended us very unpleasant. Dirty bathrooms. The plots one on top of the other with 0 privacy. Ours seemed the great way with people passing by all the time. Never to return.
20895,342350,1,poupette04,19/08/2018,"Attention, full camp site the caretaker sent us to a French individual who arranged his land for some vehicles under the pretext of helping us took 10 € per person 10 € for the camper with EDF and 1 shower and a toilet for 14 people who were there, to flee absolutely."
20895,314761,3,alex1dregirard,04/08/2018,"Simple camping, actually in the summer we find ourselves a little on each other, but access to the sea and the city center make us forget this point. Good for 1 or 2 nights to visit the surroundings"

20895,271277,3,PBK,19/06/2018,Welcome in french. Different rates depending on the size of the pitches you have to choose. What is nice is the proximity to the beach. Sanitary ok. Good for one night (17 €).
20895,263736,3,Iisa,04/06/2018,"Fully equipped space in the vicinity of the village, quiet but very busy - difficult to find a suitable place with a large motorhome. Sanitary facilities ok"
20895,251291,3,matouter,11/05/2018,"Good location but no more than 2 nights saw the benefits, a lot of French people who are there for long stays."

20895,234130,4,soniafernoux,07/04/2018,"Not come for 2 years, very pleasantly surprised by the new sanitary facilities and modern electricity kiosks, the staff at the reception very friendly, the friendliness of the cleaning team morning sanitary is still to improve!"
20895,228797,4,notrepetiteroulotte,21/03/2018,"Nice campsite, friendly staff, we stayed for 2 nights. A place ideally placed for bike rides in the salt marshes, greenways in very good condition."
20895,208109,2,valeric123,31/10/2017,We stayed only one night frankly uncomfortable in this kind of camping-overgrown camper with regulars who feel very much at home. The toilets are dated 20 € a night with a van too expensive!
20895,196804,5,cathlef58,23/09/2017,From more sea to 200 m and town center at the exit of the camp-site ....

20895,149487,4,CristinaLlamas,09/07/2017,"We travel with children (3 years and 9 months). To emphasize: careful with the arrival, very full (when we arrived there were only 6 seats left). Positive: close to the beach, quiet, clean, small supermarket, friendly workers, nearby market worthy, and bike lane for sports (near train station). Negative: close to bars with a LOT of noise until 4 in the morning; 6 showers only."
20895,135940,4,luccio,19/05/2017,Very good camping shade but a little on each other. Super ride at night by the sea
20895,119271,1,vivo,03/02/2017,Full to overflowing and more. could nt get on.
20895,118203,3,mirabelle9,12/01/2017,Well located between city and lagoon. It borders on overcrowding. Clients of regulars who believe in a reserved area. High price compared to services.
20895,110663,4,franc1port2,20/10/2016,We have been to this campsite for several years in a row and have enjoyed it all the time. Warm welcome both at the reception and the caretaker .....
20895,103836,3,jepago,08/09/2016,"Totally agree with Chris44. We escaped after three days, too bad, because the corner is superb. Three stars for camping, zero for the atmosphere."
20895,90396,4,afy3340,07/08/2016,Very good camping shaded by places a single flat noise because the evening music is at a very high level on the front and back of the campsite until a very late hour but beach level very well located.
20895,65385,4,movette,14/03/2016,Perfect welcome. We were informed about sporting activities beyond our expectations. Quite satisfactory campsite.
20895,65233,3,iakito,12/03/2016,"Camping very well placed but old as you can not find anywhere. No hot water for washing up or washing clothes, several sized locations numbered from 1 to 6, location based rate. For a motorhome 7 m long, forget 1 to 4, and again when the trees do not interfere with parking. I do not even talk about satellite reception. Rates decrease from 7 nights of presence. Everything is paying in addition to adults and location: trailer, dog, electricity, motorcycle, etc ... Everyone speaks French at the reception and the concierge. Wintering of many French regulars. To ask why ..."
20895,63629,1,quadeur,12/02/2016,"Never place and warn the guards to evacuate us from Fuzeta in the late afternoon, this year we feel proscribed in Portugal, fired from everywhere because of campsites and n the and gb that pollutes it returns in Morocco"
20895,60239,4,gg56,21/11/2015,"Good welcome. Great location near the harbor and beaches. There are 3 sizes of locations to choose from. The sanitary are correct but nothing more. Many motorhomes are installed out of season for 5 to 6 months for some. There is a train to Faro and even to Lagos, which is convenient"
20895,57677,1,christ44,16/10/2015,"We were happy to return to this small municipal campsite after 7 years but then what a disappointment despite the place dreamed between the beach and the small typical Portuguese village, we had the unpleasant surprise to cross (without any hello) a handful of ""old ""French former followers of Morocco who believe in themselves and by their behavior make us really ashamed to be French. And for us are simple and friendly people. Really sorry."
20895,44757,3,cervolix,29/07/2015,Good welcome. Great location near the harbor and beaches. The locations are not very big and we are a bit on each other. The sanitary are correct without more. This campsite must be interesting out of season when there are fewer people.
20895,34886,4,patjak,29/04/2015,"Very clean sanitary facilities, very good reception at the bar, normal reception, sea and city location, very favorable"
20895,33095,3,pheclaf,06/04/2015,"Good campsite, close to the beach, the port and the city, so convenient. The sanitary (clean) are minimalist and need a little renovation (showers without pressure - a single tap hot water dish for all the campsite). Many spend there several months, there is probably a reason."
20923,1217830,4,JosePili06,25/05/2021,"Okay, it is free, difficult to connect hose. It does not have to empty sewage"
20923,1115229,3,PeteAndMel,14/11/2020,Decent park for the night. We stayed in the top carpark. Can be a little noisy as its obviously right next to the highway. It's not a huge service stop but it was safe enough for us
20923,468240,4,baloo75,26/04/2019,"Perfect to empty and fill before arriving in Barcelona. It does not have blacks, so you have to empty them in the grille of the grays, but carefully and throwing water at the end, no problem. In the other sense there is also."
20923,232847,5,richarangi,03/04/2018,"Very good, also when you get home. you leave it clean"
20923,213238,5,Taillandier,01/12/2017,Impeccable to drain sewage and get water

20924,2931242,5,siggimueller,06/07/2023,"Fueled with diesel for €1.319, we could use the showers, toilets and the parking space for the mobile home free of charge, everything was included in the price. Friendly service at the gas station and in the restaurant. We ate a menu for €12.00, it was adequate and good. We can recommend the parking lot :-)"

I only have words of gratitude for the kindness of all the staff, both night and day, and to add that the facilities are impeccable. They have made my day!"
20924,2466148,5,Bird,28/10/2022,"We spent the night there on a Saturday and the truth is that it was very comfortable. Perhaps because it was the weekend there was no car noise, a very large car park, monitored by cameras and free. The very nice gas station attendant"
20924,1779340,3,lianaelmans,10/03/2022,It might have a higher value but for me as a solo female camper driver I didn’t feel comfortable staying overnight here. It’s next to the highway with a huge terrain for truckdrivers. There weren’t any camper vans there only truckers. Sorry but I left… Also the coordinates aren’t right and it takes you to a different area. Better to google for ‘Navatrans Service Area’

Electricity and exchange is € 2. 2 € showers, but if you have a lunch or dinner at the restaurant, it's free. Very calm. The very good location, between Cuéllar and Segovia, and shortly from Madrid, exit highway n ° 80. We will return !!."

20934,3290829,3,FannyCamp,13/09/2023,Nice campsite with a real super chill hippie atmosphere! The only downside is no drinking water and a reek of sewer odor.
20934,3278707,1,SSD,09/09/2023,"A lot of noise at night, people playing music and shouting. No shade, only for fixed caravans. Spicy food, according to the cook and waiter, is normal. Forget if you want to relax."
20934,3226658,5,Azeth,27/08/2023,"Incredible place with super nice people, we went in two cars. The showers are phenomenal, the only problem is that you have to have 0.50c coins for 5m of hot water, they do not accept other types of coins or payment because they are machines, 100% recommended"
20934,3225645,5,tempetefam,27/08/2023,"After 4 nights spent in this place just atypical, friendly and filled with benevolence. Not knowing this spot on your route would be a shame. People are cool with a lot of respect. The pool is a plus. I will come back for sure. Thanks to Mikky's"
20934,3225177,1,camperplaatseuropa,27/08/2023,unfortunately too expensive. go find another place.
20934,3224168,5,larulietta44,27/08/2023,"an atypical place as we like them!!!! the staff is very pleasant and attentive. you arrive at a hippie campsite with large pitches, here they are very dog friendly and we love it!!!!! moreover free stay for them the restaurant / bar on site is full of charm and we eat fresh! unbeatable value for money in high season (€27 with electricity for 2 adults and 2 children)"
20934,3213387,5,jorconde,24/08/2023,"We have come by recommendation and really, although with many motorhomes, the space transmits peace and relaxation. We came for one night, we stayed 3, a good family atmosphere with children of 8 and 11 years old. we recommend."
20934,3213193,1,qb2,24/08/2023,"It's a shame how this site has gone to waste. Not long ago you paid €12 for the first night and the rest €9, per motorhome with passengers included. At the pool, at rush hour, we were 3 or 4 families, I have photos from several years and you can see it. This year €26 with 2 children. More than double, the pool does not fit, the abandoned park. In short, I've been recommending this site for years... well, I never come back."
20934,3198333,1,blasjose,22/08/2023,We entered and saw that there were countless plots occupied by caravans that seemed to have been there forever. We didn't like it and we left.
20934,3162148,5,carlos.rassy,16/08/2023,excellent experience. I strongly recommend.
20934,3145435,4,rrodpin259,14/08/2023,"We have spent two very pleasant nights. For those who are very demanding, it will seem abandoned and not very clean, but it is a kind of camping only for caravans and motorhomes. As a negative point, the slightly cleaner pool water is missed."
20934,3115389,1,CristelBurgt,10/08/2023,"Dirty camper place. Stray dogs and very busy. Hippie place with special people who seem to live there permanently. Special scene, we left immediately."
20934,3111412,4,xevipuche,09/08/2023,curious place to see a world apart
20934,3084723,5,GaizkaVan,05/08/2023,"We are doing the Algarve route and this is undoubtedly the one we have liked the most so far. The places are spacious, the toilets and showers are small to say the least, however, the bar and the pool are very good. It should be taken into account that the place has two entrances, one is ostensibly official, while the other sends you down a track to the street. The price is right. They make pizzas in the bar for €10"
20934,3077757,3,catess,04/08/2023,"What a disappointment when we came in 2017 and loved it. Too many caravans, and comings and goings of cars, it is no longer an air of camping car. It remains atypical and welcoming"
20934,3030449,5,LuaRes,27/07/2023,"Great to rest from Albufeira. The common spaces are very charming, the natural pool a luxury. Super nice staff. We found everything clean. Hot water at 50 cents, not necessary for this heat. An AC with a lot of personality."
20934,3018541,1,sun.on.wheels,25/07/2023,"Unfortunately I cannot recommend the place. You can only visit the toilets directly after cleaning, everything after that is pretty disgusting. Especially the people who have lived there for a long time are really a problem. The pool is muddy and smells like sewage. Don't recommend it to anyone."
20934,3015241,4,Carlosmude,24/07/2023,Second year that we come and everything remains the same. A great atmosphere and very good attention. We will return for sure
20934,2989728,5,cparker2023,19/07/2023,"We spent 5 nights here and loved it. Very quirky, hippy vibes with lots of long termers parked up. Plots were spacious and most had shade. Our daughter loved the animals and swimming pool."
20934,2971994,5,dasafru,16/07/2023,"It is a charming place, swimming pool, spacious squares, you can see a farm with different animals."
20934,2959764,5,Bushtrece,13/07/2023,"For little, it is almost a campsite. The “natural” pool is great. The bathrooms and toilets are scarce, although very clean. The staff is great."
20934,2922439,5,winonae,04/07/2023,"We had a great night here. Was our last with the van so we could dispose of our sewage & toilet. There is no drinking water, instead there is flushing water, and I found the showers and toilets to be clean. The smell mentioned is there with 4-5 parking spaces, with 120 no problem avoiding it. The pool is great, 20€ in July/Aug. for 2 people, electricity & laundry for 5 € extra."
20934,2903050,5,Tendinha.Roadtrippers,28/06/2023,The Eden of Campervans. the best places we've had to date. Differentiated place with plenty of activities and a feeling of being in a magical place.
20934,2889570,5,tamara35,25/06/2023,just great. We went in a caravan and with a dog and everything was fine. The pool is a success to cool off. The environment and the climate of 10. We will repeat for sure.
20934,2848696,4,PabloIturriaga,13/06/2023,"Without a doubt, it is the most special place I have ever been. I'm not giving it five stars because perfection doesn't exist, but it is a unique space, cheap, with large plots, abundant vegetation and a quite unique atmosphere. The pool and bar are 10. A great place to spend a couple of days on your route through the Algarve."
20934,2825247,5,2F,06/06/2023,"A very beautiful place that our hosts have created from nothing. what happiness this swimming pool… In short, paradise… thank you"
20934,2749317,3,ABdeW,14/05/2023,"Large outdated campsite, many regular guests. Love all the animals. After 2 months in Spain it was a relief that everything is so open (no fences!). Good cycling to a beautiful beach and small village. Still only stayed 2 nights, we found it too big and plumbing is really a thing. We saw someone emptying the chemical toilet at the toilet building. A more extensive and personal check-in would prevent this."
20934,2741668,3,Danielk1988,11/05/2023,"First of all: we stayed longer than planned. The atmosphere is really great, the people and the place too! BUT: everything is very old. Especially they sanitary facilities. The fecal stench, which has already been mentioned several times, is difficult to endure. (in some parts of the square) The price of 19 euros for 3 people showers for 50 cents are too much. It's a shame because of the potential"
20934,2736675,4,mherrm,09/05/2023,"Lots of seats, great restaurant with bar and good pool. The sanitary facilities were okay, hot water costs extra. Depending on the wind, it sometimes smells strongly of sewerage."
20934,2726079,5,Marco156,05/05/2023,"A great place with a great atmosphere. The toilets and showers are getting old, but are cleaned twice a day. Great pool and nice staff. On Saturdays there is always a delicious pizza and otherwise you can eat delicious there. There are also rolls... We'll be back..."
20934,2721318,5,heikemaxontour,04/05/2023,"A sensationally great place, with everything your heart desires. Very pleasant atmosphere. Are now 1 month here and have extended by another month. Traveling in 2 years, the best campsite we have had so far. We feel super comfortable here, feels like at home. Very great."
20934,2713002,5,tomabety,01/05/2023,"Nice place, swimming pool great for kids. Lots of campervans in the end of April, seems to be popular. Carpet in each spot is super convenient."
20934,2688189,5,maildajoana,22/04/2023,This park is wonderful. It has a relaxed atmosphere and a fantastic blend of nature and art. The pool is beautiful. The restaurant is charming. I recommend you visit this place because I know you will leave as delighted as I was.
20934,2653792,5,Elcristo88,09/04/2023,Very happy with this campsite when you arrive you look for a place where you like to park and then you go to reception a luxury very happy with all the super friendly staff and for the children the animals the pool and that's perfect. The playground should be more careful because almost everything is broken
20934,2652487,5,Burini,09/04/2023,"Place with charm and to feel good. The only drawback little shade & location. Sanitary ok. In general, the campers* themselves also keep things tidy here. Affordable restaurant, good WiFi, pool, billiards, darts, various leisure activities once a day. I feel a bit sorry for many animals, little birds, but everything else with heart and soul. Many stay here longer. Beaches every 15 min by car"
20934,2646283,5,zorrock43,07/04/2023,"Incredible site, great atmosphere and good facilities, in low season 16 euros for a van for two people, the bathrooms are clean, I don't know why people complain, they clean them several times a day, you can be with your dog loose in the campsite. highly recommended"
20934,2637137,4,Europa2023,03/04/2023,Cozy campsite with many people with a good heart. The toilets and showers are not always fresh and regularly have a typical sewer (?) smell. Close to beautiful beaches with the most beautiful views. Nice swimming pool and cozy atmosphere at the bar.
20934,2624432,4,SteffiWittig,25/03/2023,"Super nice facility, not perfect, but maybe that's why it has so much charm. Great pool. Yes, showers & toilets are getting old, could invest in them. And enlarge. I didn't notice the odor/stench. Bar has delicious food and good coffee. convivial mood. Many families, also with older children. Bit far off the beaten track, bicycle makes sense."
20934,2617264,5,pe44,20/03/2023,There is a lot to discover here and the people are super nice. The atmosphere is great and the place is lovingly laid out. I actually have a good nose... I didn't smell anything... I'd love to come back!!!!
20934,2608733,4,dutchfamilytravels,13/03/2023,"The atmosphere is nice but as everyone describes. 3 toilets for so many campers is really too little! There is a lot of potential, but many people actually live here permanently. It's a pity to see it going downhill."
20934,2587093,5,kaja1,22/02/2023,"Super nice place and we have already extended three times. Toilets, showers, pool area, everything lovingly and clean. Great nice staff. We'll definitely be back."
20934,2586017,1,aras1234,21/02/2023,"The first impression is good, it has a hippy look, fun, cheerful, with a very pleasant socializing area... but when we start to notice the details, the opinion changes, where is Security? The hygiene? In certain places it smells like sewage, the entrance is narrow and dozens of motorhomes are piled up in an evacuation, what will it be like? we started to suspect the legality of the place… I do not recommend it"
20934,2585986,5,tohugo,21/02/2023,"Nice place, enough space to stand, bar pool Hippi moderately laid out area, nice talkative people"
20934,2585246,1,euramobil1515,21/02/2023,"if you like to smell sewer smell you have to be here, what a stench., the plumbing really dirty. it is dirty and filthy, we were gone quickly. with the necessary maintenance it could be a nice place"
20934,2573014,4,xaedalada,09/02/2023,"I can understand a lot of the comments here but we had a lovely time. It's not a polished, fancy site, but it's cheap and has a lovely vibe. It's a bit of a hippie kind of place, filled with lots of long term people. It can smell in a few places but there is so many places to park you can avoid it. The bar is great, cheap and full of chatty people. It's not for everyone but we loved it!"
20934,2572239,2,FranziAimee,09/02/2023,"The place has charm in places and a lot of potential - but how can you simply let the waste water run off into the hedges above ground? There is 30cm of stinking sewage (and it already smells over half the square). A lot seems unfinished or solved quick and dirty (in contrast to the cool, rustic areas) and a lot is broken."
20934,2557687,4,Timovandewiel,22/01/2023,Super satisfied with our stay. Pool freezing cold but open. Canteen/restaurant has delicious Dutch snacks. Pizza night on Saturday evening highly recommended!! Fresh pizzas from the pizza oven. Place 12.50 without electricity for 2p. Shower 50 cents per 5 minutes.
20934,2553461,4,MarkJager,16/01/2023,"Our spot by the pool was perfect. Swimming pool freezing cold, but open. Playground broken. Pay close attention to where you park your camper. Some places narrow, sewage smell, etc. Perfect at the pool! So it really depends on where you are and what your experience is like. I certainly didn't think it was massive. Unfortunately there is smoking inside. A lot is organized (bingo, hairdresser, doctor, yoga, massages)"
20934,2552244,1,MissLily,15/01/2023,Too crowded for me. That is for security reasons. CC too close to each other. Otherwise has charm and friendlyness. Many who stay a long time.
20934,2551287,5,Kissiesontour,14/01/2023,"What a nice place, with swimming pool, lots of animals, and play area for children. We stayed for a month (Dec) and would return in a heartbeat. Cozy atmosphere and excellent restaurant. There was a Christmas dinner and New Year's party, so various things are also being organized Sanitary could be upgraded, but works fine, lovely hot showers. Top spot!!"
20934,2544928,5,froschgerda,07/01/2023,Great atmosphere and very nice people. Would come back any time!
20934,2540187,4,yrsaontour,03/01/2023,Still a great place. We had nothing to complain about besides one defective shower - but the other 3 worked fine. It is true that the sanitary buildings especially the one at the reception could benefit from a makeover but they still suit their purpose. We were here for 4 days (and had a great New Year’s party) and would love to come back. The great atmosphere you get for free.
20934,2508880,1,camperaad2020,29/11/2022,"Smoking is allowed in the canteen in the same children's play corner. Everywhere it suffocates to sewage, ""fresh"" water for the camper is brown water. Half the campsite is sick. It's a shame that the government doesn't close this place down, what an incredible mess it is here, nothing really works and everything, but really everything, is incredibly filthy….."
20934,2479654,1,SuzanneKoppen,02/11/2022,"Faded glory! This campsite looks nice at first glance, but if you look further you see plastic and waste lying around everywhere. There are also far too many dogs and there is dog poo and pee everywhere, very dirty! There are too few showers and toilets and they are also dirty. A lot of regular guests who are there for months. The reception was very chaotic and not customer friendly."
20934,2477128,5,Basoline,01/11/2022,A lot of work has been done to make the place presentable again (according to returning visitors) but it could use some more attention. Too few sanitary facilities for such a large place. Cozy canteen. Restaurant (didn't eat so no idea what the food is like) present. Pizza on Saturday is really good. Mixture of visitors. Hippie atmosphere. Beautiful gardens. Places with (fake) grass on gravel.
20934,2464645,2,Metvijfopreis,27/10/2022,"In itself large places, but a lot of dog poop on them. Apparently the dog of the campsite owners is allowed to roam freely and pee and defecate everywhere, while there is a sign with clear text that ""dogs must be leashed!"". The animal harasses other dogs and chases small children. Maintenance is necessary, the price for one night (incl. electricity) of €20 in the low season is too high."
20934,2414359,2,ThomasZasso,30/09/2022,"It's the kind of place which would be amazing if it would be well maintained, but unfortunately it feels like it's falling apart. The playground has lots of broken things, plastic bottles laying around etc. the bar area is very dirty and people are smoking around. prices are also quite high in my opinion. we came and decided to go to a parking in the city instead."
20934,2397677,4,mario90perez,23/09/2022,"Quite a large and quiet campsite to sleep, with a bar, swimming pool, area with animals... very cool place!"
20934,2368853,2,yohannanovoa,13/09/2022,"We stayed one night to go to Zoomarine, the campsite is spectacularly beautiful but it's dirty, they have a bar-restaurant that could be impressive and it's full of bird shit, all full of spider webs... we forgot a sweatshirt and it took us a while in return 10 min and it was gone. They have only 1 toilet per sex for the entire enclosure. The hookups to the electricity are soaked with the rain"
20934,2346311,5,Moisesg.g,06/09/2022,"A unique experience, family atmosphere and plenty of space for children. I would highlight the pool, the variety of animals and the food in the restaurant (10❤️). The treatment is very close and I think that in terms of quality - price, there is no other place like it."
20934,2334182,5,machuca76,03/09/2022,I loved it. I was passing through and stayed a few days
20934,2324394,4,SabineFaehndrich,31/08/2022,"overall very nice, relaxed place with nice lounge and great pool. Price very ok. too few toilets and showers Therefore only 4 stars."
20934,2307052,5,famdamgo,27/08/2022,Super well equipped area with all services super large with bar and animals that can be seen very good environment perfect for visiting zoo marine
20934,2292900,5,Semarri42,24/08/2022,"Very quiet place, many people because it is high season, one drawback is that the price of a washing machine is a bit high €5. highly recommended place"

20934,2279082,1,magana,21/08/2022,"2 years ago a great place. But now no one has time to worry about the system. too few toilets, dirty pool and now also 20 €. before it was 10 €. ???????"
20934,2268378,5,leiremclouis,19/08/2022,"Well, it is one of the best places I have been, it is half a hippie campsite, with a lot of animals, a half paradisiacal pool, very suitable for children. I will be back"
20934,2245845,5,juanmam97,15/08/2022,"An ideal place if you want to disconnect, spacious plots and most of them with electricity. Very good atmosphere and attention from the staff, swimming pool, games room, animals and lots of flora. €20 per day"
20934,2232956,5,lorrys,14/08/2022,"Very nice place ideal for families, very large playground and an inflatable, cold but aesthetically very nice pool and very large internal area .. all the services of a campsite in a camper area .. price slightly higher than the average in high season ..but it really offers a lot so in the end it was worth it, we will definitely be back"
20934,2230726,4,NaslinFabienne,13/08/2022,"I confirm the comments, cool baba spirit, nice CC around the pool. 20€ per night for 2 people, add 0.50€ for hot water in the showers. CC area but is more camping in reality. I recommend"
20934,2192613,4,ohanayyulia,07/08/2022,"Quiet area day and night. We have gone with two girls and we liked it a lot, swimming pool, playground, many families. The bathrooms are not bad but for how big it is there are few. Price €20 per night. Nice place to spend several days. There is no supermarket."
20934,2181088,5,EvaLuna77,05/08/2022,"Place with a great charm! You disconnect and feel at home. The pool is beautiful, the corners with ceramic pieces, the animals... The restaurant and common areas with restored furniture help create the hippie-bohemian and artistic atmosphere. We will be back!!"
20934,2179164,5,FernandoNeto,05/08/2022,excellent place to unwind. exceptionally cheap price. Two points to improve the dated shower and having a mini market would be fantastic for basic needs as the shops are a bit far to walk.
20934,2125986,4,Anielein,26/07/2022,"The place is an experience in itself. A dream especially for children with a unique animal park and a great natural pool. The bar is super welcoming and a definite plus when the weather is bad. A star deduction for the sanitary facilities, which were consistently unclean."
20934,2121383,5,henry2110,25/07/2022,Nice place to stay. Quiet and a bit out of the way. Cool bar and restaurant with delicious food. Sanitary facilities are ok.
20934,2100257,3,karmenher,21/07/2022,"The concept of the area is great, but the bathrooms are very fair in terms of cleanliness. One day we had no water for the shower. Large pitches, but little shade. Great to spend 2/3 days"
20934,2100172,1,xgabimax,20/07/2022,"Terrible in my opinion, little cleanliness, everything dilapidated, bad smell, just as we entered we left. I do not recommend it"
20934,2099841,1,ferlojo,20/07/2022,"A little abandoned area, swimming pool, to call it in some way, very dirty and neglected, there is a commune of people who live there, neglected weeds and trees and make it difficult for motorhomes to enter and transit, in general everything is neglected and dirty, I will not return, the Price does not match what it offers."
20934,2099498,1,Isaclau,20/07/2022,"Very abandoned area, the pool was super dirty and it was because the pump was broken, due to complaints they closed it and started to clean it, the entrance in very bad conditions for motorhomes, it smells bad since there are several pools with stagnant water, high price €20 for two people, €2.5 for each extra person, not recommended"
20934,2075436,2,jfescoriza,15/07/2022,"Very nice, it is recommended to take a walk through the area and discover the plants and animals that there are to see. The problem is cleaning and maintenance, since it is null. Recommended to see but not to spend several days. Entrance through the narrow road."
20934,2073159,3,jagomsah,14/07/2022,"PROS: Family place with good treatment, level plots with 3x3 artificial grass carpets, good food, music, great bar and very good prices! CONS: Very very fair hygiene (bathrooms, pool, bouncy castle....), narrow access (1.5 km where only 1 car fits), no rules (bathrooms in the pool and entry/exit of vehicles at night), access walk to Armaçao de Pĕra long and by road"
20934,2063554,5,ainarav,12/07/2022,"our favorite area, perfect pool, delicious food"
20934,2061118,2,Rebeca80,11/07/2022,"The area is fine. Pity of the dirt in the facilities. People washing dishes where not, people throw beverage cans, cigarette butts, paper anywhere. I understand that we are on vacation but young people after midnight making noise, swimming in the pool? nobody says anything? parents of course not, owners either?"
20934,2048064,3,Chicco3939,07/07/2022,"Place creatively laid out. there are animals. Nice (salt water) pool. Facilities at the restaurant unfortunately totally dirty and without water. Shade rather little, in the afternoon on some pitches. car with roof tent plus 1 person = 20€/night; Electricity connection has to be paid for, whether you use it or not. Conclusion: The creative side is admirable, the camping-related side with question marks."
20934,2046522,3,Allan35,07/07/2022,"We stayed 1 night. We paid €20 (2 people and motorhome) Showers, emptying and filling water are extra. Price a bit excessive. Very pleasant swimming pool and different pitches to choose from, quite well laid out"
20934,2044814,4,mipiloteviajera,06/07/2022,"We were last week and it was €9.5 plus electricity and children total €18. After three days we have returned again and they have changed the price and they inform us that July and August all plots with electricity or without electricity is now €20. In any case, the place is worth it with children, it is the second year that we have returned"
20934,2025839,5,lorelai81,01/07/2022,"We traveled with children, and after several days from one place to another, we decided to set up camp for 2 days in a place with a swimming pool. , but we didn't try it, because the first night we had dinner in the van, and the second night was the ""pizza's nigth"". They were exquisite! 2 adults and 2 children, €16 per night."
20934,1984484,5,Coke83m,17/06/2022,we drove from Germany to Portugal in a total of 22 days 6600km and the place was awesome! Place-to-stay is the name of the place and that's what we did 1 day completely on the place. Price is tiered depending on the size of the pitch. We got 2 days for €9 each. The place and the flair is unique. WiFi only near the bar. Dogs and children welcome.
20934,1894753,5,Alexandra.keller,16/05/2022,"Very warm place with birds, garden, fine dining, a bar and pool. Animals allowed."
20934,1849443,5,paulikala,24/04/2022,"We have spent one night here to explore the algarve (benagil and carboeiro). It is well situated for getting around the Algarve. We arrived late and the reception was closed, but the door was open. Entered and we put ourselves where we liked and the next morning we discussed where we were and we paid the girl who was very nice. It cost us €9 for 1 night without electricity with a dog and children. It is a very nice and peculiar place, a bohemian atmosphere, hippie among the people and very careful. An indoor pool is under construction. Perhaps another bathroom house would be needed because it is quite large, it looks like a campsite (there are tents). We loved it for the children, families who travel by camper are not usually thought of and here there was a spectacular wooden play area, an indoor area with board games, crafts, stories... complete and with an air of Waldorf pedagogy. We have fallen in love with the place and will return in the summer for several days."
20934,1832846,5,Margarida14,17/04/2022,"Excellent location. Friendly people, great atmosphere. Best site visited so far"
20934,1824985,5,Rebiker,15/04/2022,"Spectacular !!! And I think that with this there are no words. Mikki is constantly renovating, it has expanded its plates and facilities and it already has new toilets and is building an indoor pool in winter that is going to be a show."
20934,1791808,2,Lepanto666,22/03/2022,"You love it or you hate it! Anyone who likes lots of noisy children, free-roaming dogs, too few showers and lots and lots of people is in good hands here. Everyone else stays one night, drinks a well-mixed gin and tonic and takes off. The square certainly had its character when there were no more than 50 vehicles here, but now it's all about maximizing sales."
20934,1790674,5,lenication,21/03/2022,"Came for 2 nights and stayed 16. Great with a child because there are many other children (DE, UK, NL). Very relaxed atmosphere. Saturday evening there is 1A pizza from the wood oven. Upon arrival, choose a seat and give the number to reception. IG lenication"
20934,1789095,5,Jolisa,20/03/2022,"28-1-22 we came for a weekend but ended up staying 14 days. Very nice place. Met nice people. The toilet building at the back exit is often the cleanest. Nice bar and fun activities during the week. Bingo, fitness to music pizza night etc. They were busy making an indoor swimming pool. I could have made some stuff and sold it outside at the RV."
20934,1776806,1,ilsa90,07/03/2022,"A very unsafe place for children. Open sewers, playground equipment falling apart, everyone gets sick and an open construction site of a swimming pool that is life-threatening. I don't understand how this place is promoted so much by social media channels. The part where the animals are located is very beautiful and well maintained."
20934,1760293,1,pijl.ontheroad,19/02/2022,"It doesn't smell nice. Open sewer. Showers not clean. Too few showers for number of people. Many families unfortunately fell ill when we were there. If everything were in order, it could really be a great place."
20934,1731778,1,knutknutsen,10/01/2022,"I have traveled a lot around Europe and have had some wonderful experiences.  I got a tip about Mikki's place to stay.  Took the trip booked 3 nights which became 8 weeks. 
 Totally fell in love with the place.  Everyone is incredibly welcoming and you become like a member into a large family from the youngest to the oldest.
 Very family friendly place.


 Greetings from a happy trawle"
20934,1731305,1,TortoiseTales,10/01/2022,"This used to be a lovely place to stay with lots of space, lovely gardens, animals and pottery ornaments which make it unique.
Now too many children running wild and making lots of noise.
The toilets are tired, dirty and neglected. The number of toilets and the waste bins collection area is insufficient for the number of campers.  Smell of raw sewage.  Water quality not good.
Not recommended."
20934,1717674,1,camperaad2020,28/12/2021,"many negatives. Power supply is unsafe (taped with garbage bags against rain) Old dirty toilets and shower. For washing dishes you have to pay 50 cents and you get cold water. There is red gunk everywhere that gets in everything. Water unusable. Yellow water. We had to have our water tank cleaned. And everywhere it smells like the sewer, really everywhere."
20934,1694223,5,Massana,20/11/2021,"AMAZING! Much more than a campsite, a home."
20934,1681684,2,Janenagnes,07/11/2021,"This is a special location with many negatives that are not mentioned: dirty, non-functioning toilets (2 for 120 campers) unsafe environment, no good drinking water, poor service at the reception (find everything yourself!) everyone can go on and off the cp , unsavory types who sniff your camper in the evening, dogs that are let out at your place. So not a well organized environment!"
20934,1661829,2,magana,25/10/2021,Nice area but far too few toilets and always dirty toilets. !!! otherwise everything was ok nice people.
20934,1660955,5,Brunoamocortijo,25/10/2021,"Spectacular .....!! It is a very peculiar place, without great luxuries and with a lot of art and respect for nature and animals ... without a doubt the best area I know so far ... we will return for sure ,,, !!!"
20934,1632028,5,Joffrik,07/10/2021,"Super chill place to stay. Were supposed to be 2 nights, but it turned into a week! With good restaurant where you can eat and have a beer!"
20934,1617373,5,virgitas,29/09/2021,"This campsite is really a must see. Every corner is designed with so much attention to detail. The atmosphere pulls you under its spell. There is something to discover on every corner - for just € 11.50 a night including electricity, this is the best campsite we've ever been to. Big plus: donkeys, alpacas, sheep and goats have a home here."
20934,1610148,5,ViFamily,26/09/2021,"Very colorful and pleasant space to go with the children. Very friendly staff. Swimming pool, inflatable, animals and many gardens to discover."

20934,1586710,5,clifie,17/09/2021,"It is worth the detour if you pass through the area. We stopped for one night but we stayed 2. Amazing pool, massage service, good food, very good service and the neighbors all very respectful. The hot water in the shower has a machine, 50cent / 5min. We pay € 15 for 2 adults with electricity"
20934,1566752,5,Francho8,10/09/2021,"We have been one night, two adults and two children and the truth is that we loved it. Lots of spaces with plenty of space, a great pool and a great area for children. There are animals and a large room with games. You breathe tranquility. We would return for sure."
20934,1549729,4,danimarta,05/09/2021,A place to relax..hippy environment ... especially for children ... many activities: oasis pool ... bouncy castle ... billiards..ping pong ... games ... park ... small zoo. .shower and dog washing machine and 2 new washing machines. ecological system of dirty water ... it smells a little ... but forgive us for the planet .. when the covid pesallida is over .. why don't the employees wear a mask

20934,1465291,3,laloli-auto,16/08/2021,"The place is great, the staff is the same, for children it is edtupendo, but they let in people with tents who stay until the wee hours with loud music and do not let them rest, they set up a disco next to motorhomes with families with children, a shame That they allow this because the site is edtupendo, we are leaving because we have not slept."

Lots to see and do for young and old. The showers are very spacious. Downsides: cold dishwater and dogs run loose, they defecate and pee in all kinds of places and this is not cleaned up."
20934,1295697,2,alex-itineo,04/07/2021,"Very good place but quite expensive.

20934,1133639,5,hansi_mueller,29/01/2021,"An incredibly lovingly designed parking space with a lot of freedom and incredibly nice operators. Unfortunately, you only see a totally outdated image on Google Maps. They have turned the whole thing into a great oasis here. There are many children of all ages and a large playground. The restaurant is great and so is the cake. This concept is unique."
20934,1122773,3,Regina65,21/12/2020,"The place should be a little more cared for. It smells really bad around the wash house with the washing machines (which by the way don't look really appetizing) and when it rains you should have wellington boots packed. One mud puddle after the other. The park is beautiful with the pottery and animals. It's a shame, a little more care, then there are 5 stars again."

20934,944500,5,ibaitxo,09/08/2020,"An oasis of tranquility, totally recommended. You arrive by a dirt road and you find this place that invites you to stay. We were just passing through and we stayed 2 days. Lovely people that the first thing they say to you is ""no stress"". Spacious pitches with pebbles and a piece of artificial grass. a discovery"
20934,937696,5,Primpos,07/08/2020,"Excellent site, we came to spend the night and when it dawned and we saw how good the place was, we stayed another night. The pool, the plot, the common areas, the restaurant ... all very good. And to complete it, they have beautiful areas with animals, an orchard, and precious sculptures. Super recommended. The best RV area I have ever been to. I would repeat without a doubt."

20934,857184,3,KrystalShip,09/07/2020,"Lovely site, beautiful to look at (colourful pottery and artwork all round the site, surrounding fields) but way over priced, unfortunately.  In February it was €12.50 per night, plus €2.50 for EHU, and we are a family of four, so an extra €5 per night for our two children! €20pn is way above average for Portugal.
A positive is the free cold showers, a negative is the old washing machines."

20934,808359,4,Shazer,24/05/2020,"Campsites reopened, expect a warm welcome from Mikki. To protect yourself you should self isolate and maintain social distancing as much as possible as the permanent residents swim and socialize freely without masks, hand sanitizer or gloves.  The place is looking absolutely fabulous and ready for summer."
20934,791496,5,jlabeille,05/03/2020,"A really special and beautiful campsite! The price is around 10 € (for several nights) absolutely great - additional services such as shower, fresh water and co. but cost extra (not expensive!). Every day there are delicious cakes and the dinner is really good. We really liked it here and would definitely go back."
20934,780799,5,Missytours,15/02/2020,"Stayed 3 nights here, very quirky place with all the pottery displays and the animals and birds in the gardens. Lively bar, very peaceful at night, friendly and helpful staff. hot showers, washing machines etc. Would definitely come back again."

The place is fully booked even in the winter months. Nice and cozy bar. Good food and good prices. A star deduction, because there was no friendly settlement on departure. Previous agreements were not followed and kicked out to have a place free."
20934,752784,5,JuliaLiAr,11/12/2019,"Totally recommended, especially if you go with children. They have many animals, a very nice pool and a place to have a beer or eat (not the best food in the world, but the place is very nice).

For those who would like to have some fun, we got you covered! just go to the backdoor of the greenhouse/pottery shop and look under the potted plant on the left side of the entrace (next to the toilets) enjoy! :)"
20934,684474,5,inseparablesviajeros,10/09/2019,"It really is worth it, we get very dark and the GPS takes you along a longer lane than if you don't know, it is scary to get in the motorhome but calmly it is very good and wide lane, Being here is like being in another era and it gives you a peace, chulisimooo !!!! I really loved it, you have to see it with animals, gardens and lakes but all very rustic. He threatened to return jjjj. Thank you for your kindness."
20934,679017,3,maria24,06/09/2019,It's okay to sleep if you get close or on the road but nothing else. The showers and services we didn't use were very dirty ... the place quite left and a bit noisy at night.
20934,664447,5,kathamlou,28/08/2019,Quiet place clean and dépaysant..c was our first time and we will return without hesitation for a moment ..the top for our daughter who started the walk was a carpet of synthetic grass that facilitated its evolution in front of the caravan ... superb pool and always a corner of shadow or land next ... to get from the zoomarine take the roundabout and continue to the gas station station galp turn right at the roundabout and continue 500 meters and then a bitumen road on the right after the sand structure park on the right ... continue to the end on a path ... staff at the top but no trace of the bosses! we will see them next time we hope ..
20934,659794,2,Shazer,26/08/2019,"We've loved quirky Mikki's over the years but sadly it's become quantity over quality, prices have increased, quality has decreased. Situated inland 10/15 minutes drive from shops, nearest beach, it's become impersonal (200 pitches licensed for 120 facilities for 60?). There's no consistency in quality with old pitches (pool area) being superior to the rest which are partly finished dirt pitches."
20934,654806,5,Romboia,23/08/2019,Excellent ?
20934,651865,4,nadine40,22/08/2019,"I enjoyed the place less than last summer, because this time we were bothered by an unpleasant smell that looked like sewer, I think it came from the water point that was up to the top locations and was worn by the wind at times, but the owners are always so kind, so I maintain my 4 stars, despite everything"
20934,648106,5,roiggc,21/08/2019,"A very beautiful place to rest. If you go with children they will have a good time with the parrots and the pool .. The plots with artificial grass .. makes you feel like it, stay one more day. we use it only for overnight and canvio de Aguas y wc but in the end we were to eat ... The GPS takes you along a narrow dirt road between fields .. and you have the feeling that you are not going well."
20934,645913,5,HymerHila,20/08/2019,"Perfect place to relax parents and enjoy children. With animals, plants, birds pool."
20934,645689,5,toutankhamon,20/08/2019,"Have spent 3 days at Mikki. Great location, very nice pool. Nice evening grill. Multilingual boss, charming, as well as the rest of the employees met. Congratulations and thank you Mikki"
20934,645516,4,latortugaylaluna,20/08/2019,"Without a doubt the best area we have been in so far. It has all the necessary services plus bar, restaurant, swimming pool with a lot of charm. A little paradise. CAREFUL! From the Zoomarine roundabout Google Maps sends you on a complicated dirt road, so you better ignore it and move on to go through the other access to the area."
20934,642382,5,DenBart,19/08/2019,Excellent play to stay for long or short term. It has everything you would expect from a camping site and allot of nice little touches. The reception area is really nice with birds and plants surrounded by pottery. I was expecting to stay for a few night but that turned into 2 weeks. Highly recommend!
20934,638587,5,Toni1902,18/08/2019,"Excellent area, we came in passing for one night and we took 4 and missing another, it has all kinds of services, saltwater pool that looks like a lake, very clean toilets, children's playground showers, billiards, free table football, very special place where children They do not want to leave, it is very similar to a campsite but at the price of laughter, we will return"
20934,638219,5,sylvainsandra,17/08/2019,"We had a great week. a very good welcome. Locations very well defined, quiet, everything is beautifully flower and for a ridiculous price 15 € per night 1 camper, 2 adults, 1 child electricity drain water and toilet and filling. I highly recommend it. Thank you Mikki"
20934,635923,5,Gorkalaitz,17/08/2019,"Perfect place to rest and disconnect. If you go with children in August, your children will not want to leave the friendships they make. Very cool bathroom area. Do not enter through the entrance that is attached to the zoomarine. Enter through the entrance that is attached to the roundabout of the galp of Pera since it is a straight and wide dirt road and on the other side it is very bad with the motorhome."
20934,624078,5,severi2002,13/08/2019,"Excellent place in a beautiful pool atypical universe as tt the rest.de beautiful bar locations, meals possible at very reasonable price. For 2 adults and 3 children and the vehicle 20 € per night. Attention reception open from 10h to 17h but possibility of settling anyway very beautiful place exotic"
20934,620083,4,CarlosAday,12/08/2019,"Great. Very good to go with children by the pool, playground with zip line and animals. The only bad thing is the access, Google Maps takes you through the entrance of the Zoo Marine, a bumpy road and a curved slope. DO NOT enter through the access next to the Zoo Marine. You have to enter through the other entrance, in this Google Maps link: Pêra, Faro District"
20934,616240,5,Alan1979,10/08/2019,"A true oasis, excellent condition"

20934,553838,5,santi42,14/07/2019,Awesome place the only bad thing in my case is they do not speak Spanish but with the great translator I recommend it but without hesitation.
20934,546488,5,fferreira,10/07/2019,"Access difficult but worth it. Very nice place with services and overnight stay at a fair price. Great for cultural exchange, there are people from all over the world and some stay months. It is even possible to rent a car on the premises."
20934,527561,5,Nani1980,24/06/2019,"We just arrived and I must say that it is much better than almost all the campsites I know. It has a special charm. We arrived outside reception hours but they told me to enter without problems and that tomorrow opens reception at 9. It has a pond-beautiful pool decorated with incredible taste. The plots have a piece of artificial turf. There are many birds that have loved. A cafeteria in which it seems that they do barbecues several days a week and it is beautiful ... we came for one night, but ... I do not promise anything! I have the feeling that we will make base here and move around the rest of the area."
20934,517801,5,Vanlifebalance,16/06/2019,I can only agree with the previous speaker. A wonderful place. It also offers events such as barbeque and excursions in the area. There is a playground and generally a lot to discover. Everything was very lovingly designed and maintained. We will be back
20934,511937,5,ClaudiAlinaGregor,11/06/2019,"Simply fantastic. If we could, we would give 10 stars. We've been on the road for almost a month now and that's the most beautiful and comfortable place we've ever seen. Everything was done with a lot of love. We wanted to stay only 1 night at the beginning, it was 4 and the farewell much hard. There are chickens, parrots, alpacas and pigs and a beautiful pool. The first night costs 12,50 € without electricity every additional 9 €, electricity costs 2.50 € / day fresh bread and rolls are available at the bar. A perfect place to relax."
20934,491185,5,IMF,24/05/2019,"Excellent payment area, great in all aspects, cleanliness, comfort, decoration, staff treatment, really looks like a campsite, plots with a piece of artificial grass, light, bathrooms with hot water, many animals to see, bar area and Great relax, pool that looks like a free lake, good food, organize activities, for those who are Spanish you have to speak some English or Portuguese because Spanish does not understand, relaxed atmosphere, dogs are welcome, very quiet, few young people , 9,50 € motorhome with 4 people and electricity, 2,50 € change of water, 0,50 hot water shower, totally recommendable, I will definitely go back"

20934,437363,4,GinaM,07/03/2019,"We were there for 1 night. It looks very nice, all the plants, nicely maintained, great furniture and ceramic work. We understand that some stay longer. The atmosphere at the place was also very open and friendly. The point deduction only because it is for our needs (not a large campers with shower / washing-up / toilet) not so suitable. Either way, we would go back because it is just so pretty! And clean!"
20934,433503,5,lachave,25/02/2019,We spent a few days in January and were delighted. We will come back. A small flat is the shops that are a bit far.
20934,430603,5,Mopedrider,18/02/2019,"Great bar, great coffee, fast Wi-fi, very busy and does fill up. More spaces are being created over the next few months to satisfy demand. A high number of long term guests and understandably so. Would recommend a stopover if on route just for the experience."
20934,429911,5,johnlark,16/02/2019,"Saw comments, sounded great, even better than expected. Site excellent and a good size. Well designed facilities and all working well.

20934,412756,5,daniellegrimwade,08/12/2018,Perfect. Very busy site even in the off season. Nice warm shower and toilets. €0.50 for a shower for 5 minutes which you put into a coin machine in the shower. Water to fill up with. Bins for disposable. Washing machines for €5.

The shower is priced at € 0.50 for the 5'location € 11 as we had a DC and a trailer and € 3.50 electricity and € 2.50 for drain and water. We will come back to it. They are expanding the field."
20934,368334,5,Julia040hamburg,08/09/2018,"For me one of the most beautiful places on earth! We wanted to stay one night and it was 4th an absolute paradise ... standing in a cozy park bay surrounded by fruit trees. The owner is very nice and there is absolute serenity on the court! You feel right at home, relaxing in the most beautiful pool I have ever seen, or sipping a delicious coffee in the greenhouse with a homemade piece of cake. I would come back immediately! One negative thing was that the toilets and showers in the days felt were not cleaned ... too bad"
20934,364110,5,Bruxina,03/09/2018,"It is a cozy, quiet place. Very good atmosphere. Hot water € 0.50 5 min. It is very close to the zoomarine. 4 km from an algarve shopping mall. We will definitely be back."

No doubt to return as a place of passage"
20934,358066,5,luluval,29/08/2018,"Super we stayed 3 days, we paid € 15.50 with electricity for 4 people per day with access to the pool which is superb.

Lovingly furnished and well maintained. 9.50 € per night for a T4. 1 star deduction, as the hot water in the shower did not work, despite payment. Another star, because the filled water tastes funny and no signs at the dumping station point to drinking water and the waitress did not know for sure."
20934,355146,5,allorente,26/08/2018,One of the best places we've been. It has a lot of charm and is very well taken care of.

20934,313599,5,Eupark,03/08/2018,"That there are places like this is thanks to its owners, respect for nature and applications like this. Beautiful place to enjoy as if you were in a campsite. Beware of the deviation of the N125 road because it is not very visible and as you pass you have to return to the roundabout of the marine zoo to change direction. Perfect stay."

20934,268301,5,vastarby,14/06/2018,"Wonderful place. All pitches have their own fake lawn. Beautiful place with plants, flowers and trees all over. Nice showers and bathroom. Good food in the restaurant. Beautiful pool. Price without electricity is 10 euro first night, 2nd to 7th night 7 euro and 8 night for free. Electricity per night is 2,50 euro. Extra good prices for long stayers. Recommend this place."

20934,235493,3,Shazer,11/04/2018,"Quirky art sculptures, spacious artificial grass pitches, lovely Indoor entertainment, bar, restaurant area, good food, everything reasonably priced. Paid 12 Euro first night (6.5 metre van), 9 Euro second night, both with electric. The only downside/compliant is they allow smoking in the bar, restaurant (indoors)."
20934,232979,4,maminie,03/04/2018,We went there around March 23rd and there were big places. for a first time I enjoyed. hot showers for 0.50 €. 7 € per night and for 7 nights you pay 6. pool. Very nice bar and meals. Very nice and friendly.
20934,226217,3,pmc.ld,07/03/2018,"The reception is indeed quite good but we feel that here are privileged long stays. Many, many people, very, very tight. Stayed 2 nights very quiet for the washing machines (5 €) and dryers (4 €). Atmosphere ""between regulars"", not necessarily so friendly."
20934,223444,5,Muddyfeet,18/02/2018,"Excellent stop, really laid back atmosphere, Friendly helpful staff. Spacious showers with plenty of hot water €0.50 for 5 mins. Washing machine €5, free dog wash area. The bar sells lovely coffee & fresh croissant, plus bread rolls. They offer a set menu 4 nights a week. It’s quiet of a night time.  Reasonably priced & discounts if you stay a week or a month. Jan/Feb time it was very busy so maybe best to ring in. We stayed a month on a large pitch with electric for €270. By staying longer we made wonderful new friends. It’s a 5 minute cycle ride into Pera for a cash point, small store, the odd bar & chemist. Armação De Pera is a 30-40 minute cycle ride but uphill coming back!! All in all a lovely place to visit with lots to see with regards to the quirky pottery pieces around the place."
20934,223054,5,Tonina,16/02/2018,An absolute must come here !!! a place made with love! an absolutely amazing place to stay ❤️
20934,201826,5,speyote,10/10/2017,Area with a lot of charm. Like a camping. The price is € 7 without electricity but the first night has an extra cost of € 2.5 (I think by the service of emptying and filling water). Electricity costs € 2.5. The eighth night is free. The shower is included but if you use hot water you have to pay 50 cents. Very cozy bar-restaurant and fairly correct prices. Everything very clean
20934,199807,5,LisaundLilly,02/10/2017,Sooo nice.
20934,196331,2,thiermax,21/09/2017,"Good reception but leave a desire because just given, the price is cashed, the manager left the bar with other people while it could take more time and care for the newcomers. Warning ! the manager told us hot shower but she did not tell us it was paying 0.50 € per person, it is a customer who told us and you have 5 minutes and when you soap the counter runs"
20934,195438,5,baguette,19/09/2017,"We needed water and could not find a service area in the area. So we came to ask nicely if it was possible to fill our jerrycan and our shower so 30 l of water. The boss kindly agreed and asked us for 1.5 euros for the service. The place is very charming, the pool is beautiful. If we did not have to leave, we would have stayed with pleasure in this beautiful little campsite."
20934,190746,4,Rubiocks74,06/09/2017,"I spent just one day and thought it was great. If I go there again I will definitely repeat. To get there you have to take a dirt road, don't be afraid that you will arrive safely."

20934,186944,5,Bourmalos,28/08/2017,We had planned to stay 1 night but this small corner of dream for camper seduced us 3 nights. Perfect and calm. Clean and all available with kindness and more. And for 13.50 euros the first night then 8.50 € with electricity. The natural pool is a not insignificant bonus. Thank you for this restful and nice stop off the coast.

20934,176990,3,mireee,16/08/2017,"It's pretty good. You have 2 washing machines and a dryer. You also have to wash clothes by hand, wash cutlery, dishes, etc. If you take a dog you also have to wash it. A part you can choose whether to have electricity or not. It has a pool of natural waters although it would be a little dirty the water was hot and it was fine."

20934,85215,5,lespicards60119,25/07/2016,"On the advice of Park4night, we arrived in this quiet, pleasant place, with a welcome in French. Meeky and her husband created a space worthy of a garden, decorated with her own creations. Much better than the Lagos campsite (horrible) and 2 times cheaper. The team also offers dinner on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Excellent and affordable. We recommend this magical place in the middle of nothing (so quiet), with a natural pool (no chlorine and frogs at night)."

Expanded to 90 locations and full! also a lot of caravans profits (prices derisory compared to a campsite) so much less pleasant stay, the rain being also part of :-( a detail: do not pay in advance the month, because if you do not stay for x reasons, they will not refund the difference! (we lost 47.50 € in the case :-("

You can always become an Orbitur member and enjoy a 20% discount. The park is spacious, with generous spaces for motorhomes, has areas overlooking the dam, and has lots of shade trees. Old-fashioned bathhouses, and only one for the entire park."

Everything works fine The places in front of the camper pitches were occupied by machines and trucks There are road works in the village We parked our campervan on the parking lanes It is a place for the locals. There are bbqs, tables and benches. You can also play football. Old carts are also on display. A cozy place"
20946,2654305,4,Hydrodr,09/04/2023,The N8-4 towards the motorhome is best avoided by larger motorhomes. But a nice and clean place. There are beautiful hiking trails in the area that are reasonably well marked.

20946,2052386,1,Danifina18,09/07/2022,"If this has been done, it can be called aerial...very sloping terrain, the area where in theory it can be filled with water leaves much to be desired, the rocks of the taps have the measure of industrial irrigation, the typical rocks of the hose do not work garden, which are usually the ones that are worn, very shabby. I get to know it and I don't even come close, to do this it's better not to do anything."
20946,1093647,1,LucasE,14/10/2020,"The AC enabled site is small and unfinished, so we parked in the car (on a slope). At 4:50 am a sprinkler threw water into the AC, waking us up with a great fright. At 8:00 am we are woken up again by an alarm with a shrill sound .. One of the taps without water .. Anyway, everything indicated that we were not welcome .. A real shame"

20969,1758528,4,nicoisa,17/02/2022,"Beautiful area. On the other hand, you should know that you cannot go to the center of Cadiz by bike because the 2 bridges are prohibited for bicycles. It would be necessary to make a detour of 33 kms."
20969,1754298,3,josefcloud,13/02/2022,"Quite ok for one night, very well attended. The street noise is clearly audible and at times loud at night. Pleasantly clean area, hopefully it stays that way. But the promenade is not idyllic either."

20969,1736158,3,gila,17/01/2022,"Nice place, shouldn't be crammed with RV's as this is a car park not a pitch! One should not annoy the local users and pedestrians with cars, otherwise such a place will certainly not be allowed for much longer"

20969,1563184,4,beasgr,09/09/2021,"We spent one night and it was quiet, the police came and stayed for a while but they didn't tell us anything and they left. To spend a night is not bad, but being relatively close to houses there is not as much privacy as in other places. There were other vans but everything was quiet."
20969,1253183,1,jomaaut,13/06/2021,"Be careful with large ACs, do not park on batteries, during the day it is full of cars and you cannot maneuver to get out. At 9:00 p.m. a group of people between 30 and 40 years old arrived with several children of 6 or 7 years old and they were in a bottle until 5 in the morning, creating a lot of scandal and hitting the AC, it is a shame that those parents gave them that example to children. I will not come back."

20969,1171347,5,elorapanais,10/04/2021,"A very nice place, on one side the urbanization and on the other the water and the possibility of walking in a beautiful environment. It's peaceful, we spent one night there, it's quite far from the center but for a stopover before visiting Cadiz it's good. We did not find access to water."

At 10:00 in the morning they where still closed. Due to the dogs walking around and leaving their drops, there are overall more flies."
20969,792651,5,Martha123,08/03/2020,"Lovely place, nice area to walk our dogs. There is a bin, toilets are 100 metres away and beach showers. Bus stop very near for a trip into Cadiz"

You have a beach bar and toilets, and in the shower you can use organic gel or at least they didn't tell us anything. Highly recommended"

20969,447852,4,Helihessen,01/04/2019,"Nice place to stay with a view of the river. Quiet during the day and at night. The small beach is within walking distance and nice ways to walk through the large, adjacent nature park. Water well next to the small bar, Díaz supermarket within walking distance. Bus stop nearby, the bus ticket to Cádiz 1.70 Euro. We felt safe and stayed five nights, although we were mostly alone. Nearest disposal site about 7km away in Puerto Real."
20969,438808,4,demiandrave,11/03/2019,"Yeah it is a great spot but to confirm: you cannot cycle to Cadiz across the bridge!!! We did it using the empty service road for authorised vehicles only and later found out it is prohibited. We got away with it but won’t do it again. We may use the spot again though but without cycle access to Cadiz the point for staying would be less. But calm, pretty and relatively secluded. Some road noise."
20969,429147,4,CarlyWicks,14/02/2019,"Lovely location. 6 other motorhomes here which made it feel safe. Unfortunately, a load of local teenagers rocked up in their cars blaring out loud music and making a load of racket - they were here from 10pm till 1:30am!!!"

But a lot of traffic yes, that doesn't bother us to sleep at night, but during the day it's non-stop. When you have a dog, you have to be very alert for the traffic and the people who enter and leave the parking lot"

Well leveled, with incredible views of Grazalema and only 10 minutes from the town center (a plus, the traditional cheese factory a few meters away). The downside: the noise of the cars from very early and that there are always ready people who park in line because their views are more important than the well-being of the majority"

We stayed only few hours for visiting the village and it looks peaceful and clean."
20975,1863640,4,gusichica,01/05/2022,the place is spectacular. the only thing that has some soundtracks that sound when cars pass at a high speed. some character is dedicated to spending the night and early morning honking the horn. and some compis dedicate themselves to camping. let's be consistent that later we will be prohibited from parking anywhere. thank you
20975,1814834,5,Eloy57,11/04/2022,"a car park near the town, you can spend the night because I asked the local police."

20975,1781740,5,Caballoloco,13/03/2022,"Very comfortable, without great slopes and close to the town of Grazalema and several trails in the area. Ideal for exploring Grazalema. There is some noise from the speed markings on the tarmac right on the stretch of road leading into the area, but traffic is non-existent at night. We have not seen prohibition signs for motorhome or camper overnight. Highly recommended."
20975,1780400,5,kyky49,11/03/2022,Ideal parking for visiting this pretty village. a little traffic noise in the evening and in the morning but quiet night. We were 8 CC. beautiful hikes to do from here.

20975,1775349,5,dref59,06/03/2022,"People who are weak sleepers and well flee, a main road with speed bumps, a constant passage of cars. Grazalema deserves to be seen but at what cost :) grandiose panorama. No services plan before arriving. But to get to this place you have to make kms of switchbacks in the mountains it is very very hot in a large motorhome"
20975,1752245,5,catetphiphi50,10/02/2022,a small car park to visit the city very nice and especially when leaving to take the road to Zahara which overlooks the lake magnificent view
20975,1749294,5,Boch51,06/02/2022,"Really convenient location to visit Grazalema and her beautiful landscapes. Parking is gravel and flat, the views are great. Previous comments complain about noise from the road but there is very little passage at night and we had no complaints staying the night. Felt secure leaving our RV to explore nearby. There are several pastures to say hi to the goats, sheep, pigs, chickens and cows too!"
20975,1745951,2,KinitoSpiti,02/02/2022,"It is one of the few car parks where they allow overnight stays. In the car parks in the mountains, it is prohibited. The floor is dirt with some unevenness. Next to the road, with soundtracks to harmonize our sleep. Perhaps you can enjoy the sunrise with a beautiful view of the town, yes, the foreigners who insist on parking in line and camping at will leave you a hole."
20975,1737310,2,bikefire,20/01/2022,"It is a place to park during the day and enjoy the views or visit the town, nothing more. Being next to a fairly busy road it is difficult to rest and enjoy the tranquility. During the day the neighbors pass by for a walk, and at night it is quieter until 6:30 when the noise of the cars begins and is heightened by the soundtracks on the road. NOT RECOMMENDED"
20975,1725694,1,raunavi,04/01/2022,"4 AC owned the place. Tables outside, music and voices until the wee hours, their dogs shitting all over the place and of course, emptying the water in the same parking lot before leaving .... very good friends !!!"
20975,1718694,1,George1207,29/12/2021,"Great hikes from this village into the hills however for an overnight has been our worst. The local boy racers take great delight in speeding over the rumblestrips on the road, the bin got emptied at 2 am, I kid you not! And then to top it off a local set off fireworks pretty much til the early hours of the morning."
20975,1718167,1,karpediem,28/12/2021,"The place is neither more nor less than what many of us deserve. Of the 11 vehicles that we are in right now, 5 are parked in a row instead of in a battery, so that less than half of those who could enter enter. to go very well for all because of you, the poor must need a plot to feel free"
20975,1714184,4,isabellaoh,22/12/2021,"Good place to stop and rest or to stay overnight as it is one of the only places in the area where you’re allowed to sleep. Spent two nights here and as mentioned before there’s some noise from the road, but we slept fine. Many hikes near and the view is quite good too."
20975,1708452,3,Salocin,11/12/2021,Parking day night good to visit the city.
20975,1707738,4,nmhenriques,10/12/2021,"Nice and quiet place. The 'but' is that it is right next to the road, and there are some soundtracks that play when cars pass. The place is quite level, and has beautiful views of the town and the Sierra. There is a container for garbage, and in the hermitage a water basin."
20975,1699143,5,ffijo,27/11/2021,"Very good place to spend the night, quiet, very crowded"
20975,1698877,5,capf18,27/11/2021,"Good place to spend the night, although it is close to the road at night, hardly any cars pass by. Quiet and with beautiful views, you can go to the town on foot taking a walk (about 10min)"
20975,1695212,4,Drownedrat,21/11/2021,"Good  quiet overnight stop, outside the village but only 10 minutes walk in. Three other vans with us.  Would return, we slept well."
20975,1686143,5,mathetmath,12/11/2021,Great view !
20975,1683500,3,butfun,09/11/2021,"Stayed the day only but would spend the night.  Only 1 other van all day so nice and quiet.  Clean with bins available.  Tap at the church yard opposite.  Tuesday is market day but still didn’t feel busy.  We did the Cueva de las dos Puertas walk, the signage was very scarce but we made it by luck & following small piles of stones.  Approach road from Ronda was fine in our 7.5mtr."
20975,1661304,3,David82,25/10/2021,"Esplanade of land, on the outskirts of the town, with a lot of car traffic during the day, but very correct to visit the town. Nice views"
20975,1659363,2,Grigri2,24/10/2021,"We have been coming for years and this is going from bad to worse. The site is fantastic, but the behavior of the people leaves a lot to be desired. People sleeping in a tent ... people with a portable electric generator on all night ... Please, we have to take care of it together."
20975,1639246,3,Paolosbird,11/10/2021,"Unusual for us to do an actual proper parking site, we much prefer more out of the way, just us type of locations.  However, we struck out at our first two places so came here.  Pretty awful road noise until quite late, and rammed with motorhomes of all shapes and sizes.  However, potable water available, decent walks and scenery, and several lovely cafes"
20975,1621013,4,MartaHortencio,01/10/2021,Excelent spot with awsome view to Grazalema village. The soundtracks that exist on the road make the passage of any car quite audible.
20975,1620842,3,Gapencais,01/10/2021,Nice view of the village but even at the beginning of October a lot of vehicles. I think the speed bumps will rock our night
20975,1615840,4,SaraAircrag,29/09/2021,A very quiet night with beautiful views. A 15 minute walk from the town where there is a great selection of bars and restaurants. There were about 4 more vans parked. No fine. I would repeat!
20975,1601814,5,amadoperez,23/09/2021,"good area to sleep, at the exit of town, and very quiet. recommendable"

20975,1576075,4,annapebels,13/09/2021,"Quiet place despite the road next door, very nice views. A little dirty from some toilet paper."
20975,1557080,4,Crumbleszatan,07/09/2021,"Nice spot with beautiful view but it is close to a road so a little noise like next to each road :). Rather flat, a good ten places and 10 minutes from the village center on foot."
20975,1529499,4,Peyadama,29/08/2021,"Quiet place, but we went for the weekend in August and there was a party with loud music. But the place is good to sleep. A bit of noise for the named circumstances. There were more AC and vans, but for August, very quiet. Recommended. To nothing of the town walking, 5 minutes walking."
20975,1519714,5,Jose-Pepe,27/08/2021,The best place to be in the Sierra de Cádiz and visit Grazalema. Close to a slightly busy road but with great shade from the trees and unbeatable views of the town and mountains. There is no service more than a container that is appreciated. Very quiet place where we could spend a perfect night accompanied by other campers and ac. Remember to respect nature and the environment
20975,1493616,4,PacoyMarian,21/08/2021,"Perfect place to spend the night, with some shade and unbeatable views of the town, it is also very quiet."
20975,1480188,4,Txangoneti,19/08/2021,"Although I only stopped to eat, I will return to spend the night and do some route. It is wide, level and with a tree that ensures some shade."
20975,1437850,4,Apablo1,11/08/2021,Wide and level field before reaching the town. We have spent the night with a lot of campers and ACs. Very close to the highway.
20975,1387504,5,MarBarcelo,31/07/2021,Highly recommended place to spend the night and see Grazalema. Extraordinary views. 15 min. walking uphill to town. Beautiful and peaceful.
20975,1284774,5,furgofamilysantander,29/06/2021,"We have spent one night here and we have had a wonderful time, a quiet place with stunning views of the town of Grazalema. Highly recommended."
20975,1277656,4,izaprub,26/06/2021,"We have spent two nights. The first, a Thursday, super quiet. The second night, Friday, some kids started spinning at 2:00 a.m. In the same way, it is a splendid place to visit the town, do hiking trails and if it is during the week there is no noise. There is also the hermitage with a fountain in front."
20975,1237472,3,covita,05/06/2021,We spent the night very quiet about 5 camper and a motorhome
20975,1235530,5,alfonsoselva,04/06/2021,"Good place to park your motorhome and visit, a very beautiful town, you eat very well and cheaply"
20975,1234913,5,CONLDELOLA,04/06/2021,"Site with beautiful views. Perhaps a bit bothersome the proximity of the road, although at night there is hardly any traffic. It has no services. We go down to the Ubrique gas station (24km), with a water loading and unloading service for € 3. We would certainly repeat."
20975,1227451,5,RojAleo,30/05/2021,"We have spent one night here and I have to say that the place is fabulous, it is true that it is next to the road, but the views and the enclave are great. The noise of the cars has not been annoying to sleep. Just 10 min. walking from town. We will certainly repeat."
20975,1221910,3,faurys93,28/05/2021,"It goes up sharply to visit the village which, in my opinion, owes its popularity only to its position and the unity of its constructions. To sleep it's really not that great, noisy, too close to the road. If you plan to continue on the A372, there are much nicer places once you have passed the village."
20975,1220021,5,yamil_87,27/05/2021,It is not the best place but it is the only one that is allowed in the town of Grazalema. Next to it is a cemetery with a fountain. The site is silent. It has some leftovers and is more or less flat.
20975,1207115,4,camillewtr,19/05/2021,Great place 10 mins walk to Grazalema town. A bit of passage at night but that did not prevent us from sleeping well. Perfect for setting off on the hiking trails of the Grazalema natural park. We did the El torreon hike just a 10 minute drive away.
20975,1195363,4,pablolarri,13/05/2021,Good place to visit the town that is a 15-minute walk away.
20975,1188702,4,chemagutierrez,08/05/2021,"You sleep super quiet, it has no services but is very close to the town, the odd car passes but the views of the mountains make up for it (there is a small tap in the cemetery)"
20975,1186993,5,angladaja,06/05/2021,Area 10 minutes from Grazalema. We have not spent the night but we would have if it had been necessary.
20975,1185212,4,Arkenot77,04/05/2021,"Site with beautiful views of the town. About 10 minutes walk, the way is uphill but the descent is more comfortable. Being close to the road you can hear cars passing by, but generally a good place to spend the night."
20975,1185018,3,laucla,04/05/2021,"Good place because it is close to the town, I do not recommend going up higher with a motorhome, it does not have any service and is a bit noisy"
20975,1183986,4,luismiru,02/05/2021,"Good site, near the town and more or less flat. Of course, I doubt that it will last long and overnight stays allowed when people set up a campsite in a parking lot ... (cooking on the ground, advances, chairs, tables, rinsing utensils ...)"
20975,1173460,3,elorapanais,14/04/2021,"Superb view and access to the village in 10 minutes, good for the day, but it's noisy to sleep there with the road nearby and bumps to slow down the cars which make noise not possible, I really advise against for the night if you are noise sensitive"
20975,1164222,4,JessikaEvadic,02/04/2021,"Quiet place on the outskirts of town, with spectacular views, without any service, to park and spend the night. 10 min from town. At the gas station there is no water or emptying service and the owner is unpleasant."
20975,1158344,4,giulia96,27/03/2021,"Unpaved and fairly flat parking, 5 minutes from the beautiful center of Grazalema. There is a rubbish bin. From here you can enjoy the view of the whole town and the surrounding nature. Close to the sometimes busy road. Very busy on weekends. Overall, a good place to spend a night and visit the country."
20975,1149661,1,jordibella,10/03/2021,They don't want us in parking lots near the town I'm going bye bye
20975,1128059,4,marialed81,04/01/2021,"Nice and very quiet place. We have spent two nights there together with several motorhomes and vans. The only thing that does not have any service is a parking lot at the entrance of the town, in 10 minutes you are in the center of the town."
20975,1124918,4,anibal1977,28/12/2020,"Quiet place to spend the night, 10 min walking from the town, with views, the police come to see how everything is going and they were very kind to us, there is no motorhome service and in the town the prohibition of parking for motorhomes is signposted, the The only one but, is that 9 motorhomes and some give the note, like making a bonfire, so in the end they will also prohibit us from being here"
20975,1123947,4,Manuelkaravan,26/12/2020,"Enchanting place. A walk with magnificent views to the town, approximately 10 minutes. Good atmosphere and very quiet night. Highly recommended."
20975,1098454,4,nobo77,19/10/2020,"Ample parking close to the city. In the evening, however, in the early morning I was woken up by the noise of cars, there are decelerators on the road, which increases the noise. I felt like I was in a parking lot by the highway :)"
20975,1092909,3,cortinass,14/10/2020,The place is very good but the people are very dirty. Much smell of urine. We went somewhere else
20975,1072973,3,Romanini,27/09/2020,"Parking with some shade, in 10 minutes walking on the sidewalk you reach the town. Very noisy. Be careful to go to Zahara de la Sierra. I recommend not crossing Grazalema and going down towards Zahara, a very narrow road with many curves and an awful precipice. Go through Algodonales."
20975,1060695,5,TorroCamp,20/09/2020,"Good parking at the entrance to Grazalema (Cadiz). I have only tried it to take photos, but I think it could stay overnight without problems. I add photos."
20975,1060610,5,danitania,20/09/2020,Perfect for the car and to be able to visit the town of Grazalema .... somewhat noisy road to the side but good views with benches to the other side ...

20975,1031093,5,chrisur,06/09/2020,We arrived in the afternoon and decided to park there and take a walk around the town to be near the parking lot. Very frequented by climbers. Good atmosphere and worthy town to stroll through its streets. We were very comfortable.
20975,989720,2,biker-van,21/08/2020,"The truth is that it is the best option to spend the night due to its spaciousness, but in our case we find it too noisy, due to the speed bumps"
20975,986974,3,JRM64,21/08/2020,Good place to see the town with a little shade. The road has some difficulty for large ACs.
20975,984517,4,nitos,20/08/2020,Spacious and with some shade 20 min walk to the center
20975,858111,5,xandru,10/07/2020,"Ideal to know the town and to spend the night, the sunset with a full moon and looking at the mountains as our son says is priceless ... 100% recommended."
20975,791830,3,jacknight,06/03/2020,"If the two other car parks at the entrances to the city are well positioned for the visit, this car park here is more suitable for staying overnight. But from there, you can also access this little gem by a small secure road: very pleasant walk."
20975,790926,4,guillemurgui,04/03/2020,"We spend the night without problem. Very friendly policeman, he told us how to place the van. Nice views of the town. Without services"
20975,790687,4,jessy74,04/03/2020,"Between this village and Zaharra de la sierra difficult to choose. Breathtaking. Superb very typical white villages, very high up. Better than to Sierra Nevada. Do not miss it and maybe there are others !!!!"
20975,790345,2,rob_machin,03/03/2020,"Yes it's noisey, its quite level, dusty and rough, it's free, and it's got a bin, that's it. I think the locals have a good laugh at us trying to sleep there,,, which ain't easy !!."
20975,780830,3,madder,15/02/2020,"Ample parking more or less level, quiet environment, but the worst is traffic noise, quite annoying during the day and at night the low traffic is also noticeable. The fault is, above all, for the presence of speed reducers just at the parking lot."
20975,779630,1,yeq,13/02/2020,"A plain of land on the outskirts of the town with the road 2 meters. To spend the day is fine, sleeping is horrible. They do not stop passing cars from 6 in the morning and it is impossible to sleep. I do not recommend to spend the night."
20975,778464,5,biquet5155,10/02/2020,Large parking lot along the road (quiet at night). Magnificent view of the valley and the village. We can picnic without problem. Opposite a chapel with fountain. Beautiful village 10 minutes walk with various shops. Oil changes can be made at El Bosque 10 km away and not in the car park. As we have seen.
20975,775572,3,acuita78,02/02/2020,"It is an esplanade about 10 minutes from the center of town walking, we spent a quiet night. It is true that cars are heard when passing but at night it is quiet. Super nice town recommended to visit. They fit about 30 motor homes."
20975,767535,3,kekokiwi,11/01/2020,"Sorry for the noise, there are always people, right in front of the cemetery, the town and surroundings of the best of the mountains, good views, worth it"
20975,763565,3,stayfree11,03/01/2020,"Parking quite wide, next to the road. We have been 2 nights without problems. Traffic is heard, but there is little during the night. Beautiful views of the town. 10 minutes to downtown."

20975,734182,3,JulioMM,30/10/2019,"We have been three nights without problems, climbing in the magnificent sector Plaques de Cortijo. It is a simple parking lot of land that has no more services than garbage collection and is somewhat noisy, but since the campsite above the town is closed for renovations and that there are hardly any places to park in the town, it is a good option."
20975,727940,4,Masseix,23/10/2019,A large parking lot for small and large camper Sleeping according to your pretentions.proche city for visit. parking stained by waste.
20975,725885,2,Tornjak,20/10/2019,"Not bad but a little too far from the village if the stop has only the visit for objective. Accessible to all sizes, shaded and stabilized, it is also the parking of coaches. No service but satellite reception and 4G optimal."
20975,717476,4,vicenteacebal,10/10/2019,"Parking on the side of the road with enough space. 10 minutes walk to town. Road noise, especially due to some noise that makes a lot of noise."

20975,500901,2,en.ri.co,02/06/2019,"If you don't mind the noise of cars, that's fine. Consider that the bollards, if taken at low speed, do not disturb too much, amplify the noise of the cars at high speed."

20975,427944,4,Zesobreiro,10/02/2019,"A quiet place to spend the night, a fantastic view, ten minutes walk to visit the village and worth it, is beautiful. Although it is on the edge of a road, at night it is not very noisy. When we arrived, in the middle of the afternoon, there were not many people, but until night the space became full. We liked it, no service, but beautiful"

Tap with water in the hermitage next to the parking lot. But you can not abuse. Other sources at 300m for any emergency. Ideal to take the road walking towards the town. Is beautiful."

Good to sleep peacefully in low season. Pretty town with narrow streets, a medieval castle and great views of the entire area. Routes on foot and by bicycle leave from the same town."

If you go with a dog, there is a lot of space with a forest so that he can de-stress from the hours locked up in the Camper. The only downside is the access. If there is a car parked badly in the street above, you have to maneuver or look for the street below like us"

The bad: lifeguards are as if there were none, we with small children in a small pool putting up with teenagers making bombs and bothering users, playing ball, etc... silence is not respected, after 12 o'clock 1 in the morning they continue to make noise, barbecues, in short, a camping without law"

But the price is steep. 73€ for 2pers+electricity/night (for the smallest pitch) and it's not even the peak season price! The high price is not justified and we would not go there again.

Yes, there are a lot of dogs, but the extreme cleanliness on the site and the generally pleasant, relaxed atmosphere also have an effect on everyone making sure that it can remain so pleasant. well-stocked supermarket, the swimming pool and the sound of the sea when you fall asleep... just great!"
21020,2498585,5,corricavallo,17/11/2022,Fantastic campsite…very comfortable pitches even for large campers…heated swimming pool with hydromassage in winter…very clean bathrooms…motorhome washing area with water jet…recommended both restaurant and shop…summer baby club…cycle path towards the town center…very kind and helpful staff…simply fantastic.
21020,2493088,5,Runnertrail,13/11/2022,"The top in terms of cleanliness, beautiful pitches, beautiful sanitary facilities, very beautiful central aisle. We will return."

21020,2411740,5,Heikeundbonnie,29/09/2022,"Very nice place, reasonable price, very friendly staff and everything piko bello clean. I can only recommend him. Stayed here for 5 days ??"
21020,2323125,3,JackieHarrison,30/08/2022,"Dreadful roads to get from the motorway to the campsite.  The campsite is spotlessly clean and well groom . Small pitches and hard to get into with a 8m motorhome.  We ate in the restaurant,  food was good but the staff were unfriendly.  We would not stay here again ."
21020,2309353,4,KimRuitenbeek,27/08/2022,"Nicely set up campsite. luxury swimming pool. Different sized spots. Tight twist to the spot. loos spot at the very back of the campsite On the beach. Part pebble, part sand. Youth was very noisy both during the day and in the evening."
21020,2256912,5,JulesAuterlot,17/08/2022,"3 months ago Wonderful campsite where we stopped for one night ...and stayed there for 10! Reception, friendliness of all the staff, cleanliness... The campsite is adapted to the needs of children in the sanitary facilities and the swimming pools. The supermarket sells everything at fair prices, the restaurants have excellent value for money. The sea is 2 steps away with a magnificent beach. Heaven"
21020,2244040,1,agulinaress,15/08/2022,"disastrous, they wanted to give me a plot with two walls of 5 meters without shade. I ask them to change me or give me my money back, they tell him that I will lose the 40 euros of the reservation. I preferred losing them to baking in the sun. They don't care how they treat the customer. I will not come back"
21020,2168724,1,Bonapart,03/08/2022,"far too expensive, let the crisis pass..."
21020,2167038,4,Gaelle-Jeremie,03/08/2022,"the location is incredible, feet in the water... it's very very expensive, it's true (82€ for 2 adults 3 children) but swimming pool with 2 slides, children's club, toilets cleaned continuously, showers open H24, mini Consum supermarket on site... super beautiful setting, very clean location raked after each departure. frankly, a dream place !! in the shade and more which is a plus!"
21020,2086428,5,CarolavdG,17/07/2022,"Yes, not cheap, but that is not a good campsite on the Spanish coast. This one is absolutely worth the money. Perfectly maintained spacious pitches (choose whether you want a small or large pitch). Super friendly staff, very clean & good sanitary facilities & lovely beach just on the other side of the road. 1 thing: why not free WiFi at this price? The campsite is too perfect to take a star off it"
21020,2039488,5,SandyTue,05/07/2022,"We were there during the Easter holidays, we could choose the place ourselves. There are refrigerators for rent. Soap was empty, otherwise everything was large and clean. Wifi subject to a charge. Pitch 34€, adults (from 10 years) 7€, electricity 6€. Check-out until 12 p.m., extension until 6 p.m. €10."
21020,2034471,5,FamiliaTerremotos,03/07/2022,"Perfect campsite to spend a couple of days, load water, empty poti, charge batteries with electricity socket... Right on the beach, dogs can enter and they have a bathtub to shower them. The supermarket inside is quite well priced, the swimming pools are very good and the toilets are clean. Advisable 100%"
21020,1963282,4,autokarramarra,10/06/2022,"Camping with heated pool that gives it a plus. It has Acsi for users of this card. If you don't have it, it seems like an expensive campsite. The beach that is at the gates of the campsite is made of stones. Nearby restaurants and a walk to town."
21020,1947212,5,LorenaM,05/06/2022,"The people at the campsite are very friendly, clean facilities, there is a very large swimming pool for children with a shaded area with sun loungers for adults. Supermarket where you find everything. Plots of all sizes"
21020,1902484,4,roroschi2022,20/05/2022,"very nice campsite, large pitches, very friendly welcome! everything very well maintained and very clean. 1 star deduction for bad and expensive wifi and not very friendly staff in the restaurant. conclusion: highly recommended!"
21020,1851918,4,titounne,25/04/2022,"Large, well-kept campsite, demarcated pitches of different sizes. The toilets are clean. There is a well stocked small supermarket. Beautiful bike rides. The village is 3 km away, easily accessible by a pretty seafront. Small flat, the weekend regulars arrive and a bit noisy until late at night"
21020,1777409,5,PhoenixCologne,08/03/2022,"Very nice, clean and well-kept campsite right by the sea. Super equipped. In the pre-season with ACSI card quite cheap. Always my pleasure."
21020,1734698,5,SjesOnTour,15/01/2022,Beautiful campsite. Very safe. I was alone here with my 2 children and not once did I feel unsafe. The pool stays open all year round so that was great fun for the kids too. Only downside the shower is either very hot or very cold or it fluctuates from hot to cold. Environment is like walking into a magazine. Very nice.
21020,1721637,5,Grubenbecher,01/01/2022,"Very nice days spent here over New Year's Eve. Super clean, everything works, and actually almost fully booked. Top!"
21020,1705399,5,Maribeluna,07/12/2021,"Good camping, all the comforts inside there is a super Consum, very good prices at the foot of the beach 5 nights with light € 100, restaurant with very good prices, we will return"
21020,1679352,3,JeremyTania,05/11/2021,"Quite expensive campsite (48 euros per night) for the facilities offered, especially in November. Strong smell of evacuation in the sanitary block and blocked drains in the washing-up area. A single large sanitary block for a very large campsite far enough from our site. Suppl. for Wi-Fi. A little impersonal. Positive points: heated pool, good location next to the beach and quiet."
21020,1662822,5,ginss67,26/10/2021,"Beautiful shaded pitches, luxurious sanitary facilities, very clean swimming pool near the beach, friendly welcome, well-stocked supermarket, we will surely come back"
21020,1653072,3,natbouchet,19/10/2021,"Lots of people, a little on top of each other, very good and inexpensive mini-market, by the sea but not much to see."
21020,1626749,5,pm5818,04/10/2021,Very nice places in different sizes and good shade places. The area is very quiet and right on the sea. The sanitary facilities are clean and in good shape. Shops with all the necessary things right on the square and in front is a bar. It takes about 30 minutes to walk to town and there are some beautiful beach bays on the way.
21020,1610221,5,weinsi,26/09/2021,"Top campsite right by the sea. Unbeatable cleanliness. You'd really have to search to find the fly in the ointment. Supermarket at the place seems to be for the whole area, since the selection and the prices are great. Staff friendly and constantly cleaning, without disturbing. I would give it 6 stars too!"
21020,1591741,5,BabetteBo,19/09/2021,"A very nice, clean campsite with a pool and a few meters from the beach. Very friendly staff. There are places of different sizes, separated by oleander hedges and trees. You can choose your place freely. The sanitary facilities are amazing, almost wellness oases, extremely clean, hot water, soap, exquisite equipment, you don't expect something like that on a campsite (6 * for that)"
21020,1590112,5,jpaulstb,18/09/2021,"In front of the beach, very large pitches, very well maintained campsite for 20 euros out of season with acsi to recommend"
21020,1550516,3,McHeck,05/09/2021,"Mixed impression. Big camping, good showers. WiFi way too expensive, and that in 2021! The location right on the beach is of course unbeatable."
21020,1530625,4,Archelon5,30/08/2021,"Few motorhomes on this date. This is due to the high price while on September 1, it will be 20 € with acsi. Disturbing to see the rates in July and August preventing families with children from having affordable camping vacations. We stayed two nights to let the thunderstorms pass."
21020,1490223,3,EM15,21/08/2021,"Very well located campsite, good facilities, not suitable for resting, bottles are made on the walls of the campsite (from the outside). We start to sleep at 5 in the morning. The plots next to the main gate are torture, people go in and out giving the metal gate a loud bang. Surely in low season it will be very good"
21020,1489831,5,javialerta,21/08/2021,"Highly recommended. In a spectacular place (not a typical hyper-turbulent place). In beachfront. It is not idyllic (a lot of stone), but a wild point that captivates. Very good facilities. Spacious, new and clean bathrooms. Good and cozy pools. Well-kept pitches. Large, complete supermarket with normal prices. In short, a great campsite. We will be back without a doubt."
21020,1462005,1,MichaelaSevim,15/08/2021,"The place makes a good impression, but we only drove through it. 62 € for 2 people / 1 night was too expensive for us."
21020,1331714,3,DavidParker,17/07/2021,"Camping with good facilities and very clean. Next to the beach, with swimming pool, supermarket and restaurant. 3 nights AC and two people € 192, I see it very expensive, paid wifi separately in 2021, I come to think that they have inhibitors, but it is what there is in July. Pretty noisy neighbors."
21020,1279280,5,lobosolitario13,26/06/2021,"Good atmosphere, great facilities we will definitely return"
21020,1213848,5,luluigini,23/05/2021,"Beautifully designed campsite in a beautiful location. Nice staff, clean, nice toilets and showers. We paid 20 € / night for two with a car. Unfortunately, wifi costs extra, very expensive. Right on the beach, which wasn't too crowded. There is a small supermarket at the campsite, but it was only open on Tuesdays and Sundays (maybe only in the off-season). The next supermarket is about 2km away and can be easily reached with a nice walk on the beach. Several beach bars and restaurants nearby. Highly recommended!"
21020,1182024,5,GuenterKoenig,30/04/2021,"This is a very nice place very clean and friendly staff. 20 € for a mobile home and 2 people with electricity, water and pool. Very large plots surrounded by hedges. Very nice large washroom and toilets. You can go cycling here very well."
21020,1176400,5,malaman5,19/04/2021,Super clean campsite with large pitches. 20 euros two people and a van per night with access to electricity. They were also super friendly and treated us great.
21020,1160877,4,TenaciousThie,30/03/2021,"You have to like it. Fully paved and graveled. Exactly parceled out in various sizes. Nicely separated by nicely grown hedges. Large playground, heated and covered pool, open restaurant. We (42, 40, 4, 2) liked it so much that we stayed one night longer and weren't even at the beach. WiFi costs extra and deducts one star."
21020,1132986,3,hasenteufel,25/01/2021,"Campsite very nicely laid out with beautiful large plots, everything was very neat. Beach with large pebbles not really nice to look at. 3 km from the nearest town."
21020,939070,1,XIgor,08/08/2020,"I am not going to say that the campsite is wrong because it would not be true. The campsite is clean, the manager is very friendly and the restaurant waiter is charming. Otherwise it is a normal and ordinary campsite at a price of 50e per night for two people and a van, on a small plot without electricity. There is no Movistar coverage and Wi-Fi is paid. For my taste expensive and the wifi one unthinkable in 2020."
21020,913182,4,Sergiopri,30/07/2020,"I do not give it 5 stars because after paying € 62 a day for 2 people and a motorhome, I consider that Wi-Fi should be free. It is paid and expensive (€ 5 per day) Otherwise a very good campsite, with an excellent restaurant. The staff (Mustafa) phenomenal. Other services, toilets, swimming pool, supermarket very good."

21020,761753,3,Francky33,01/01/2020,"Pitches that are small and difficult to access. Noisy on December 31 because management accepts that some put the sound system in the middle of the day! Positive point for the sanitary facilities which are clean and well heated, 20 € with the Acsi card"
21020,726259,1,campervandog,20/10/2019,"Redicoulously over priced.
We just tried to stop there expecting to pay around 18 euros per night.
We were quoted 26 euros per night for the smallest pitch.
This was Mid October 2019, dread to think how much high season costs.?"

21020,669238,1,Jeroni,31/08/2019,"It seems that they have enough clients and they treat you with contempt. You have to pay in advance without the possibility of a refund if you have to leave before. Today I asked if instead of 12 it came out at 1, answer, one minute after 12 and you pay € 10. It is noisy until 12 or 1 in the morning, enter the one who wants if no surveillance. The expensive prices for what they offer."

Beach 10 m, beautiful city center 15 minutes walk, sound waves to fall asleep"
21020,389760,2,FrauColumna,08/10/2018,"Located directly on the sea (beach forbidden for dogs) and at first glance high quality equipped. Very friendly multilingual staff, both on the square and in the restaurant. But: sanitary dirty, zero privacy, in the evening very loud music and a large parrot next to the reception alone his existence in a too small aviary fristet. WiFi by the hour bookable, expensive fun. But then a hefty price of 32.50 euros for 2 people, 1 dog and electricity. For one night okay, that would not be longer for us."
21020,309534,4,BenoitLauvergne,01/08/2018,"Superb campsite, ideally located at the seaside. Sanitary recent and very well maintained. That happiness, except maybe a waitress not very friendly restaurant but we must have fallen bad! I recommend it."
