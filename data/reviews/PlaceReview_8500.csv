106635,3243344,3,escargot22,31/08/2023,"city that deserves to be visited, correct area compared to Spanish standards but very pity the sewage treatment plant right next door noise of pump and especially really unpleasant smell."
106635,3223842,4,rafaydana,27/08/2023,"Quiet place to unload. The faucets are changed; the threaded one with pressure on the side to rinse the toilet, and the low pressure one without a thread on the clean water filling point. The change does not imply any cost. The town is pretty. It is recommended. Thanks to the municipality."
106635,3183195,4,FernandoFerrandez,19/08/2023,"The site is simple and basic but I liked the experience. Silent, it has water, drain and sink for washing or washing. The shaded area is quoted, but sufficient. There is a garbage container. Also illuminated. Drawbacks: there is a generator nearby that every so often makes a slightly annoying noise. But I came just to take a nap and in the end I stayed a whole day. and the town of 10"

106635,2898989,4,marinec69,27/06/2023,Very quiet place on weekends. Nice place with good catering. You hardly hear water purification. Occasional whiff of scent from the small plant. Draining gray water is a bit tricky; small well

106635,2774476,4,SimonF15,22/05/2023,"Nice spot, room for 5 small units. We missed the signage to turn right and ended up going through the town, no issues for our 6m camper. The turning is right immediately before the bridge. We were woken at 6:45 by the local farmer running his tractor next door! Guys got to make a living I suppose but a bit of consideration wouldn’t harm!"
106635,2762610,5,PacoSampedro,19/05/2023,We have spent the night here alone. Very quiet . The services work perfectly. A step away from the beautiful and well-kept town with welcoming people. We highly recommend it. Thank you very much for facilitating our stay.
106635,2691749,3,JYE19,23/04/2023,Quiet but very desolate place. We stopped only to see the town and eat at a well-known local restaurant. We went to sleep in Castañares de Rioja. It has a better area. Thanks anyway to the Sajazarra town hall.
106635,2669312,4,distritocamper,14/04/2023,"Small and quiet area perfect for eating and visiting this small town. We did not stay the night this time since the internet coverage in that area was not very good. To get there, it is best to follow the signs at the entrance to the town."
106635,2649888,4,juanolo,08/04/2023,Small area but it is appreciated. The town is beautiful and close to visit. The only drawback is the emptying of gray water that is not functional and is small. Very quiet at night. The bells ring but it is bearable. These types of initiatives are appreciated.
106635,2615509,5,daveiga87,19/03/2023,We spent one night. Area equipped with all the basics except electricity. There is a generator that makes noise from time to time but when we slept we have not heard it at all. Very close to the town. We would return.
106635,2615057,4,Danain,19/03/2023,good place to sleep. It's practically in town. level and calm. The only bad thing is that you can hear the water treatment plant and the bells of the town. To visit it is perfect and the precise town

106635,2540025,4,Antoniopurchil,03/01/2023,"Great leveled and illuminated free area, the only drawbacks are how small the gray water chest is and that there is a small treatment plant very close and perhaps in summer it gives off an annoying smell, at Christmas we have had luxury. Although here they put up for 6 motorhomes, I think at least 10 or 12 can fit."

106635,2411792,4,thelianin,29/09/2022,parking not always easy to access because narrow street at the beginning of the village but we got there with our 7.5m. Gray water difficult to drain. Free clean water and a friendly village to visit. Beautiful bike rides to do in the middle of the vineyards. Light on the parking lot all night too intense.

106635,2030684,4,Juanky59,02/07/2022,Very quiet area in a nice and cozy town. It was named one of the 100 most beautiful towns in Spain for a reason. The only thing missing is the gray water drain grid. Thanks to the City Council for providing us with spaces for our needs.
106635,1889643,4,WanderWebb,14/05/2022,Nice little aire in the edge of the pretty and very very quiet village. Slight intermittent hum from the water works and an occasional smell but nothing too offensive. A little shade available. Very well signposted through the village and easy to find.

106635,1826276,3,Danikrack,16/04/2022,"There is a generator near the area that looks like a reactor and the noise is annoying, there are strong smells of sewage at times. The worst were the children of the motorhomes parked there, playing and shouting around the other users since 8 in the morning. Little empathy for others on the part of the parents."

106635,1502293,4,mrtxll1987,23/08/2021,"Very quiet area, with a picnic table. Very close to the village. I put 4 stars because the water outlet to be able to fill the motorhomes is not standard and we were not able to fill it even though we asked all the cars and campers that were there.

Anyway, we slept super well!"

106635,1387877,4,JRM64,31/07/2021,"The area is well a little small. The access very well indicated. To get out, take the same driveway since the GPS gives another route that passes through the center of town and it is impossible to maneuver with an AC of 7.5 m. The charming town. At RTE Ochavo you can eat luxuriously."

106662,2294084,5,Dodgevan,24/08/2022,exceptionally clean maintenance area rarely seen at this point. (congratulations to the site team)
106662,2284008,5,DavidS.G.,22/08/2022,"Perfect and quiet place. At the end of the visit to the cave, we stop to empty and fill it."
106662,2098452,2,elvi,20/07/2022,"We did not use the services, we parked to visit Las Grutas de la Moneda, with the coordinates the GPS took us correctly"
106662,1881447,5,gito002,10/05/2022,"There is ample parking, easy to maneuver a long vehicle. Very clean toilets, water point and gray water drain."
106662,1837823,5,jodu1965,19/04/2022,Clean good place. Water appears to be intended only for rinsing the cassette. The fresh water tap is shut down.
106662,1550645,3,carolleDeboves,05/09/2021,"For water, have the right connections. otherwise nothing to say impeccable slept a very quiet night."
106662,1115125,5,Lu_Ma_Tra,14/11/2020,Very clean. Friendly staff from the grotto. Toilets were also open. Grotto is worth visiting
106662,1062669,3,molly95,21/09/2020,Ok services but a push tap so slow to fill
106662,1062316,4,Phil10kn,21/09/2020,Very handy in the area. Too bad only one water point (cassette and clean).
106662,974568,5,Alexangie,17/08/2020,Perfect for emptying wastewater
106662,958631,5,AnaPaulaCostaSilva,13/08/2020,Excellent for water maintenance / change. Unloading the toilet cassette.
106662,748212,5,dantro54,29/11/2019,"Excellent free Aire with full facilities (incl. very clean toilets, rest-rooms, cafeteria etc) BUT only between 09:00-17:00hrs. NO OVERNIGHT stay permitted because they lock the gates at 18:00hrs. Parking area is solid cobblestone but is sloping in all directions. Perfect for an ""empty and refill"" stop while visiting the caves or Fatima."
106662,550017,5,franckvoit,12/07/2019,"Very good for the services, possibility to sleep in front of the grills, cave visit"
106662,529245,5,bernardvoyageur,26/06/2019,No problem filling with the right fitting
106662,514127,5,fraphnc,13/06/2019,"For the drinking water connection, provide a female 26/34 connection."
106662,513251,4,eagleroad,12/06/2019,"Service area available to visitors ""camper"", which is very nice to have thought. Note that the emptying of wastewater, toilet cassette and water filling is free. Important recommendation, to refuel with water, impossible to do by connecting a pipe. It must be filled with a can and funnel, very very strong pressure, no connection can hold. But thanks to this site for thinking of us!"
106662,484786,5,cbrv@hotmail.fr,15/05/2019,Thanks to the site for this area and the visit of the cave is worth it
106668,2732813,4,meichhorn,08/05/2023,"We spent a quiet night here. In the evening there were a few walkers, otherwise quiet. Near road is audible, but didn't bother us."
106668,2682195,3,Pascal1969,19/04/2023,"Nice area given the proximity of the highway. On the other hand barbecue forbidden, we just got hit by the police..."
106668,2586579,4,Mariike,22/02/2023,"We spent a quiet night here, obviously it's a place to go to sleep and little else, but it was clean and the night was super quiet!"
106668,2445229,2,Camper_damah,15/10/2022,very careless. You cannot access the river and the route is just a mini walk. it is dirty and unmaintained
106668,1958619,3,quiqueruiz,08/06/2022,"Neglected is not enough, the city councils do things for the elections and then simply abandon them, they have nothing and it is like nature is leaving it abandoned. It can be used for a break or sleep but as I say total abandonment."
106668,1881469,3,BOGOVAN,10/05/2022,"Poorly maintained picnic area. Ideal for resting and stretching legs. Quiet and very close to the highway, but it is not noticeable. No shade for vehicles."
106668,1852376,4,bikefire,25/04/2022,Perfect place to stop for lunch/dinner and continue the trip. quiet for nap
106668,1829611,3,FerManza,17/04/2022,It could be a nice place to be but it's not very well maintained and it doesn't have a water source. a pity The sound of the road is hardly noticeable to sleep.
106668,1829078,4,linki,16/04/2022,"A little further on next to the pier there are more tables, it is flat and there is a small fountain. The noise is not so noticeable"
106668,1790552,1,WombatM,21/03/2022,"Close to the freeway, the noise bothered us. The place is a single mud pit after rain."
106668,1769404,3,Cuatroenfurgo,28/02/2022,"Quiet place to spend the night and stop to rest, there are picnic tables, no water, no emptying. We also did not see containers in the area. Although it is a transit area, nobody bothers. We spent one night with AC and the dogs were able to run loose with no problem. There was quite a lot of mud, yes, in the rainy season I would not recommend the area. Keep the environment clean!"
106668,1764435,4,JIvan77,24/02/2022,Good place to sleep and make a stop on the way. There are tables to eat and a small promenade to stretch your legs. Please let's keep it clean.
106668,1744819,3,ekiben,31/01/2022,"very good and practical but currently, has just been treated with herbicides and the smell is strong and it hurts the skull..."
106668,1743839,3,Jeffbar64,30/01/2022,"Very handy on the way back. Just off the freeway, the parking lot is below, so traffic noise is less bothersome. The railway is noisier. The terrain is quite flat, but given the tracks, the rain must have turned it into a quagmire."
106668,1718647,4,montecorto,29/12/2021,Good place to rest and watch birds. There was a lot of mud in the access to the parking lot due to the recent rains. Cleansed. You can hear the road but it is not annoying.
106668,1703118,5,Rebanabielas,04/12/2021,Picnic area with tables perfect to spend the day or spend the night. Lots of calm.
106668,1702658,4,zurix,04/12/2021,Site next to the highway. Very quiet to spend the night. Next to picnic tables and the stargazing center. Perfect for a night on the go.
106668,1657878,2,blaiseetvero,23/10/2021,"For us unattractive and dirty, rubbish everywhere. We hear the highway but nothing dramatic. Went to sleep without worry. Only for troubleshooting but has the merit of existing. Trouble-free access with a PL"
106668,1558993,5,farrupark4,08/09/2021,We have made a stop to eat. further down you can park at the foot of the river.
106668,1542213,4,romekjokel,03/09/2021,"Good place to rest for one night, but be careful where you step - unfortunately there's poop everywhere"
106668,1281931,4,camper_serli,27/06/2021,"We have slept one night and it is wonderful, it is on the side of the road but you can not hear so much that you can not sleep. We were alone with another Camper and it is a wide and fairly level esplanade. It has stone tables, there is no water fountain or other services."
106668,1081864,5,Madbird,04/10/2020,"We stopped to eat and very calm, we were alone. stone tables and pretty clean."
106668,871047,3,leoquesada,15/07/2020,Beautiful place to stop to eat or rest. Let's be respectful of these spaces and we will always have them at our disposal
106668,862587,4,Edusnowy,12/07/2020,The place is located near Cordoba city. We stayed one night with the van with the pop-up roof and even took out the table and chairs and we had no problem. A Civil Guard car passed by and said nothing to us. The site is quiet and you can take a little walk. The site is quite dry and there is not enough soil.
106668,726651,2,lostwithamnesia,21/10/2019,Traffic sound & strange smell. Could be good for a short stop tho.
106668,612512,1,AuroreDcs,09/08/2019,"We wanted to go to the parking a little further than the picnic area. False idea: a lot of group walkers or young people, but also cars cars suspicious enough, with each time a man and a woman who remain in the vehicle ... in short, I do not do drawing! We tried to keep going and go among the olive trees further, but it was a second failure: a lot of car pass farmers in the area. We then tried around 22h to go in the village above: impossible to find a flat and discreet corner. We left the place against the heart and exhausted, towards Cordoba. We stayed at the lake dam, see location on the app."
106668,612034,3,TuyYo,09/08/2019,"Easy access to the picnic area, there is only shade in the table area, the van stays in the sun."
106668,605859,4,Bitxeiros,07/08/2019,"We spend the night. A tad of noise down the highway but not in excess. In the morning, good place for breakfast since there are stone tables."
106668,522247,4,mameval,20/06/2019,"Good for Cordoba. All spots in the city being disgusting, we preferred to ride 20 minutes to be green"
106668,482838,3,tamirosal,12/05/2019,"Good place to stop, we had lunch and a little rest. We do not spend the night"
106668,460209,3,balcam,20/04/2019,"Very convenient, just off the highway. We had a good night in the rain, not disturbed by the highway."
106672,3266380,3,RamonVerges,06/09/2023,"Parking on the outskirts of Artà, where we spent the night in the sandy parking lot. Quiet place but during the night there is movement of cars and people who park to go to the center in the leisure areas. Recommended if you're passing through, we didn't see the police at any time and no neighbors said anything to us."
106672,2604295,1,Shibainu,10/03/2023,"NEVER for vehicles longer than 5.40m!!!! Access only possible directly through the city. Currently under construction on the access road, alternative route leads right through the city through the narrowest of streets. We got stuck several times with 6m.... Pay attention to the no-through sign for trucks, this seems to refer to the width of the road or the narrowness of the junctions."
106672,2481193,4,rosisroad,03/11/2022,"Do not drive here with a camper or van. Not even if your car is “only” 6m long. The place is good but you can only get there through the old town of arta. Up to 6m vehicle length you can drive in there, but we are desperate. We just barely made it back out and brought the traffic to a standstill and our van is exactly 6m long. With a normal car it is already very tight."
106672,1825814,5,MonicaMallorca,16/04/2022,"Quiet night for Easter! From the car park for Good Friday they light up the castle with torches, beautiful! If you go through the gas station, with a transporter you pass without any problem. You are 5 minutes from the walled Monastery, where there are beautiful views of Artà!"
106672,1695057,4,eiderishu,21/11/2021,"I stopped for a while to visit the wall and the tower and eat there. It's worth the stop, if only for the views from above. I didn't stay to sleep, it could be a good place to get out of trouble. The streets of the town are very narrow! With a Renault Trafic I was soooo fair!"
106672,1458148,1,MARIARP,15/08/2021,"There is a magnificent car park next to the Repsol gas station that does not appear in this application, but you will easily find it. It is great and free. ATTENTION: DO NOT enter the old town with a van or motorhome! It is very narrow and you will almost certainly get stuck or rub against the vehicle."
106672,1008943,3,SvetlanaCousinie,28/08/2020,We stopped for lunch at this parking lot. Unfortunately there is little shade on a hot day. However you can easily find space and parking and in the heart of the city.
106674,2605219,5,YlBlu,10/03/2023,"it will depend on the season, but it is a flat seafront car park with about 50 spaces. in this period, March, there were only about ten cars, so there was plenty of space. no security problems, you can leave the camper or stay overnight. we just spent the whole afternoon recommended"
106674,1533367,1,AESE,31/08/2021,"Parking for cars, motorhomes do not fit and less in the summer season when the site is highly sought after. Small and fair places, you can barely open a car door. a lot of traffic, noise and passing people. Camping in front, try your luck at the campsite"
106674,739481,3,Roel964,07/11/2019,Right next to a very wide beach! We stayed here on November 5 without any problems. But I am curious how long the residents and the neighboring campsite will tolerate this.
106674,448431,3,Melina85,03/04/2019,Good off season parking
106674,430224,1,Meri87,17/02/2019,"At night, although there is a lot of traffic but at eight in the morning there is a lot more traffic and a lot of people and cars making a lot of noise and you can not rest, they park cars very close to you, you can not get out of the car ... unthinkable summer."
106674,398213,1,Josephinemarteens,24/10/2018,And great walk to do along the beach and have a coffee in the sun.
106674,397965,2,Josephinemarteens,23/10/2018,Small friendly parking. good for one night or more. Stay discreet.
106676,2431350,5,Feggers,08/10/2022,"The place is an old serviced road, great for stopping the night… shade from trees…the road is fairly noisy but in the evening the traffic is minimum…within 25 mins from the nature park … a few papers around!!! Be human and kind and take your rubbish with you.."
106676,970509,4,tamgl84,16/08/2020,"Quiet place to spend a night. It doesn't have any services, just a picnic table. It is next to the road that is at a lower level, at night we did not hear much noise. No car passed on the access road during our entire stay. You enter and leave the same place because the road is closed, but we had no problem turning around with an AC of 7m. Little to do around but it serves as a stop on the road between Trujillo and Monfragüe."
106705,3051055,5,joanmagrans,31/07/2023,For lunch in a good shade.
106705,2970132,5,MarinaFever,16/07/2023,"Great area with two picnic tables, very quiet and shady. We had a great night and spent the whole day there since I work remotely. There was a very good internet connection. We ate at the station restaurant, a delicious menu for €15. All perfect!"
106705,2796374,2,Majon21,28/05/2023,"Quiet place, right on a beautiful bike path (railway) to Tortosa or Benifalet. Unfortunately, toilets were closed."
106705,1603387,3,xondi,23/09/2021,"It is not the most beautiful place in the world, but we have spent a couple of quiet nights without noise, some dog in the background and yes, the labrador with the tractor flattening the ground can give you the afternoon if you are looking for absolute silence. The place is safe and pleasant, surrounded by orchards and fruit trees. The noise from the road is hardly noticeable. The menu at the bar next door is very good, with grilled meat."
106705,1485807,3,almu12,20/08/2021,Small and quiet with a nearby bar. To sleep we went to Xerta.
106705,1159745,3,ElCau,28/03/2021,"The place is nice, we planned to stay the night but in the end we left after dinner as it would have been impossible to sleep due to the noise of several dogs barking non-stop. Much better at the Xerta jetty."
106705,1095397,4,livio52,16/10/2020,Good locations a bit noisy with the highway but nice.
106705,801988,5,laura_pons,15/05/2020,"This place is great to spend the night. super quiet, it has tables and the bathrooms are open depending on the season. gave me a lot of confidence sleeping there"
106705,762748,3,joandsf,03/01/2020,Good place to sleep and make the greenway. Access narrow but has a good time. Watch out for the branches. In January the bar was closed.
106705,738823,4,Sunny002012,05/11/2019,Not far from the road. but still a quiet place during the day and at night. in the morning the panorama is very nice ..
106705,690400,4,Jere,14/09/2019,Good place to stop. I am from the area and it is a quiet and safe place. One could also spend the night.
106705,638200,4,claude31,17/08/2019,Beautiful shady place access to the entrance of the village of Aldover take the viaestacio and pass the old train station and the restaurant the tables are just after
106709,1738303,1,Kutter2,21/01/2022,"Impossible to get a place for a WoMo. The self-appointed parking lot attendants guide you into extremely narrow passages, I retreated."
106709,1737548,5,Alexandrina,20/01/2022,"It can get a bit noisy at night, but if that doesn't bother you, you can stand here for free. It is not intended as a camper place and therefore one cannot expect such comfort, but for parking close to the center or doing laundry 10 minutes away it is a good option."
106709,1715589,5,Boxireist,25/12/2021,"We went here on the holiday and the whole area was empty. We were able to park great and tour the city. More cars came in the evening because there is also a restaurant here. There is also parking along the street for larger RVs, but I don't know how busy it is during the week."
106709,1144313,1,frenchfamilytrip,28/02/2021,The place does not seem suitable either for parking during the day (for a large motorhome) or for the night. This is a parking lot for shops ...
106709,1112482,5,kahoy,05/11/2020,Great spot close to the city and an interesting neighborhood with classic block buildings!

5 min outside of Leon, 
Easy parking"

106732,2675080,4,weltraumaeffchen,16/04/2023,quiet street parking lot with large lawn and lake access perfect for sunset
106732,2659577,5,DariusT,10/04/2023,"A very good stop for the day, for some reason no one recommends it for the night, a couple of minutes to the pink salt lake on foot, there is also a beach there not only for wading but also for swimming."
106732,2641586,4,adelalre,05/04/2023,"Good place to park. We didn't sleep, we only visited the pink lake, but it seems like a safe area to spend the night. There are houses with good people."
106732,2639884,4,MariaAZ,04/04/2023,"Quiet area to visit the lake. We only stopped for a short time. Apparently it did not give us insecurity, there were few people and all visiting. On the other hand, I find it too lonely and a bit insecure to spend the night. Not suitable for large vehicles"
106732,2145079,3,salamamcvan,30/07/2022,Good spot for parking while visiting the pink lake but doesn’t feel safe to stay a night
106732,1820804,4,FiniFreese,14/04/2022,"Parking was very easy and good, just a lot of mosquitoes so it's best not to have the doors open without protection. Pink Lake right next door"
106732,1756700,4,isabellaoh,15/02/2022,"Street parking in a quiet area. Good place to eat lunch and go for a walk by the lake. Enough space for a van, might be tight with a motorhome."
106732,1750261,3,povilas393,07/02/2022,Not the best parking for large campers. Parking spaces are narrow and road not very wide.
106732,1153472,4,xondi,19/03/2021,"Super wide, clean, flat and very quiet street with a lot of parking space, I do not understand the complaints about this. Nor have I felt insecurity, they are urbanizations of bungalows and normal people. Next to the pink lagoon. I have parked two days and zero problems. Lots of grass for kids and pets."
106732,1100494,5,lagunarosa,20/10/2020,Perfect

106732,1081151,2,gigifox,04/10/2020,"Street near the lake. Possibility of parking for a quick visit. Some pink reflections, nothing extraordinary. Curiosity to see. I will not stay there for one night."
106732,854856,1,nounita,08/07/2020,"Passing through Torrevieja at night, we settled in a square along this street. Everything seemed very quiet until ""someone"" pulled us onto the motorhome with a ball pistol. Obviously a neighbor who must not appreciate the presence of motorhome in his street. My husband searched, but the person concerned had to stay well hidden in his apartment. She fired 3 times. So we changed places. Despite this mishap the place was very quiet but packed with mosquitoes!"
106732,801018,5,lagunarosa,09/05/2020,"I live right in front of the lagoon and many motorhomes come to spend the night. It is a very quiet place and I have no news of thefts. Anyway, the area is totally recommended. You will see my car over the wall. I know what I'm talking about"
106732,792297,1,vanesik27,07/03/2020,"Beware, there are drug sales nearby, I would not recommend this place to sleep, just to make a brief visit ... it is very nice, but keep in mind that they can steal ...."
106732,790342,1,alaindeloin33,03/03/2020,It is a parking lot for VL along the sidewalk so not provided for motorhomes! I do not see the point of putting posts like that !!!
106732,789243,3,fred.voyage,01/03/2020,"The markings on the street are again a bit narrow for campers, but the street is wide enough. Nobody thought it bothered. You can do it with a normal camper between the orange trees. Every now and then one is missing, so that you can park there with longer vehicles or easier. Almost flat underground. Little traffic, people go for a walk, dogs run, jog. No other sounds perceptible, especially at night, very quietly. You can see the lake from the parking lot or walk in 3 minutes, but it is not pink at the moment."
106732,780907,5,isaway,15/02/2020,"We spent one night there, it's super quiet in this season, February, little traffic and a view of the lake."
106732,778243,3,Irie,09/02/2020,"Quiet spot, along the street next to a park. Nothing special but seemed safe and nobody seemed to care that we were standing there. Lot of dogwalkers. The pink lake was not pink, too much water."
106732,717063,3,bm.aroundtheworld2,09/10/2019,"We stopped during the day to go to the lake, the street seems quiet in this month of October."
106732,448255,4,DanWhyatt,02/04/2019,Parked here during the day for a few hours and felt safe and quiet. Would be ok to sleep the night.
106732,444928,5,nicolabushell,26/03/2019,"Perfect park up for the lake, felt very safe, it's free, flat and possible to stay overnight although we stayed just for the day and made our way to the coast for the evening."
106732,426179,2,Becka,02/02/2019,A beautiful place for camper vans. Unfortunately not for the campers of 2.90 m. Height. There are orange trees close to the road and block good parking along the curb.
106736,789582,3,philiz64,01/03/2020,"Very practical for the ascent of the Caro if you do it on foot, (courageous because 10 min by car), not quite in the middle of nature ..., road just in front and a house opposite but quiet. Not many other possibilities in the area."

106740,2169158,2,Kapucin38,03/08/2022,"Not quiet at all the day we went. Maybe bad luck because there was a swimming competition at the municipal swimming pool which ended late at night... then a concert, and music all night afterwards. Not to mention that it was very hot!"

106740,1766020,5,Miguelbg,25/02/2022,"parking next to municipal swimming pool without services. It is somewhat inclined but there are many car parks on the side of the roads that do not have an incline. Very quiet, places to have a drink around well priced. recommended if you are on the road."
106740,658320,3,LeoPascual,25/08/2019,"The town is quiet, plenty of shadows and it's fine if you're on the road and you don't want to deviate too much. Some bars, taverns and restaurants. We have spent the night and in the morning I bathe in the municipal pool that is very good, they have also told us that they eat fabulous in the bar."
106742,2902545,1,Lipperontour,28/06/2023,Absolutely not recommended. Very hilly sandy road. A lot of rubbish on the side of the road. Main beach of the outskirts of Lisbon. Aind immediately turned back. do not belong to the church.
106742,1271031,3,ASFB,22/06/2021,"Camping is not Allowed, the police and the military, patrol the area frequently. Mosquitoes, sometimes a lot of rubbish, during the weekend/summer it's crowded. At night some not good people might appear, not a good place for the night. Drunken youth at night for party and many illegal activities on the surroundings. The road is bumpy, potholes, dusty, winter time a lot of mud."
106742,613803,3,legallf29@gmail.com,09/08/2019,We also came across a barrier .... closed. We then took the road further south which leads to the end of the earthen arm. There are many locals who camp there.

106742,421103,4,herru,07/01/2019,"We join in: very nice quiet place (opposite city you can hear, but still far away), but the road is fierce. for 3 or 4km we have unbelievably needed 20 minutes over a path with many potholes. Attention also on the way: take the way from the south to the peninsula, our navi wanted to send us through the naval base ..."
106742,413336,4,jomaha,10/12/2018,"A star deduction only because of the infinitely long and very bumpy path. The place is gorgeous, there are showers there (we have turned it up with the water pump pliers;)). Right on the water, to see sunrise and sunset. The journey is worthwhile !!!"

106759,1793745,1,Damartinezcon,24/03/2022,"The site is very beautiful and is very close to the bat cave but you can't spend the night, or at least that's what the forest policeman told us (in a very kind way by the way) who accompanied us to a parking lot where we could spend the evening."
106759,1790095,4,oceeme,21/03/2022,"A very nice and quiet place to rest, eat, take a nap... I don't know whether to spend the night. Be careful on your walks, because behind there are ""bees working"" and I got scared chased by one of them."

106759,1306932,4,ElMRN,08/07/2021,"Very nice spot with your choice of views over the hills or towards the valley! Wake up to the sound of goat bells and some hikers. Just the life of the mountain! As there is no service or trash can, take back your waste and, why not, some dirt that would have been lost in the area."

Steep road. We do not see much the valley as higher but it is also beautiful! The Civil Guard has gone to take a look, no problem. Dogs must be tied. No service, thank you to keep the place clean."
106761,789574,1,philiz64,01/03/2020,"I could not put 0 star ... Indeed parking, a little Caro view and garbage containers, just under the windows of neighboring homes. Avoid unless everything has broken down!"

106771,943308,3,novamoon7,09/08/2020,"We stayed here one night. The lower parking lot was already full of cars and we then stood in a street bay. It was very quiet, but you weren't really private."

106806,2506796,5,thevandot,27/11/2022,"This is one of the nicest places during our 2 months in Spain. A nice & warm welcome, very good wifi and excellent sanitary facilities. We came to rest for a while. Although it is in the countryside, there is plenty to see by bike. The only downside I can think of is the barking dogs and flies in the area, but there is little you can do about that."
106806,2494585,5,fan4womo,13/11/2022,"Was only there 5 minutes. Everything seems a bit small for large vehicles (> 8m) and there is a speed bump. However, the owner is very friendly. The small square is very secluded next to private buildings. - Disposal only at the BP petrol station 500m down the road. There is a vending machine there, but neither dishwater nor drinking water is free."

106806,1184470,5,DebbyCtH,03/05/2021,"Beautiful and special place. You don't play tennis every day. Lovely people who are always up for a chat. And beautiful area for walking the dog. Even nicer (and tastier) are the bakery, the supermarket, the greengrocer and the liquor store that just drop by at the motorhome. With all kinds of delicious version products. We had 3 great days here!"
106806,1181833,5,Bernd551538,29/04/2021,"Everything was great, very nicely done and lovely people. Everything is there what you need. We will be back. Greetings Rosi and Bernd"

106806,1144475,5,olive4,28/02/2021,We just spent 3 nights at John and Saskia’s place. They were great hosts and are clearly passionate about their project and the region. We really enjoyed all the hikes from their place - the countryside and views are stunning. We loved too buying produce from the visiting baker and butcher/grocer. The bathroom was spotless. We would love to come back another time.
106806,1142044,5,WillyenKatten,24/02/2021,"John and Saskia thank you for the warm welcome. I immediately felt at home. I can heartily recommend the ""extension table"" that you organized to everyone, because it was not only very tasty but also very cozy. I will come again next year for sure."

106806,1103740,5,sylann,24/10/2020,Excellent reception we park on the old tennis court which has the advantage of being flat and we have a panoramic view of the countryside and the mountains. Our hosts being motorhome operators everything is done for our well being: sanitary with extremely clean shower. Kitchenette. Possibility of emptying gray and black water and making water.Excellent fig jam! Yes the dogs from the neighboring farms bark: it is normal in the countryside but they have respected our sleep. This morning a magnificent flock of sheep passes a short distance away. I highly recommend this place to nature lovers who flee crowded and uniform campsites
106806,1088328,5,biloute1960,10/10/2020,"A great atypical place (set on an old tennis court). Surrounded by fruit trees, silent. Possibility of walks. But the main thing lies in the reception. We feel more like friends rather than customers. I recommend The pool is a plus. The bathroom unit is nickel."
106806,1088235,5,HansdenOtter,10/10/2020,"A beautiful place, with beautiful views. very sweet and very helpful owners. a nice pool. and a nice bathroom. a good washing-up place. regularly a nice extension table. with local products. the groceries are delivered daily / weekly. you can enjoy walking and cycling here."

106806,763622,4,odysee,04/01/2020,"Extremely warm welcome, small, not many places. Full when we arrive at 5 p.m. But we were able to stay. One less star for neighborhood dogs that howl to death all night. Provide earplugs."
106806,748146,4,ACKrijgsman,29/11/2019,Perfect spot for a relaxed visit to this beautiful part of Spain. You receive a warm welcome from the owners. Lots of info available about activities in the area. Bathroom an toilet very clean.
106806,737434,5,Evajilo,03/11/2019,"Private area of a very friendly Dutch marriage, they give you all kinds of tourist information of the area. We spend the night very quiet, surrounded by countryside, with very clean bathroom and shower."

106806,475546,5,AgurMaandi,04/05/2019,It was a better version of our home ☺. Moroccan price but European quality.
106806,446095,5,funkyronster,29/03/2019,"Lovely small place run by a very friendly Dutch couple, who of course speak perfect English and make you very welcome. We particularly enjoyed the local traders who come in their vans - fresh bread daily plus a different one every day. We bought lovely wine, meat, fish and vegetables."
106806,429867,3,Louise71,16/02/2019,"Very nice setting the Dutch owners very welcoming, no drain on the ground for black water, small washing machine but no dryer. In the morning the baker spends between 10 / 10:30 bread loaf tomato / tuna. Rando John will explain the courses. I recommend."
106806,421421,5,Annemie1,09/01/2019,"Wonderfully quiet, and as mentioned with amenities and every day someone who sells something, bakery, fruit and vegetables, wine, gas bottles etc etc"
106806,421366,5,Radja,09/01/2019,"Lovely place, amazing view! Beautiful area for walking, cycling or just enjoying the peace. Every day a greengrocer, baker, cheese farmer comes along with tasty products! You can also do the rest of the shopping in the village near Anna (walking distance), you can also have a bite to eat and / or have a drink! Saskia and John make you feel like coming home!"
106806,421322,5,GBoeyink,08/01/2019,"Been here for the 2nd time now. The view in combination with the sun is fantastic again. Last year, the baker, the greengrocer, the fishmonger and the vintner were already wonderful. Now the dairy farmer came with his goat's cheese and special rice pancake of goat's milk. All facets of enjoying life are provided by John and Saskia from Senssleep."

106806,421283,5,Gooff,08/01/2019,Nice small-scale motorhome in beautiful surroundings. Good place for walking and making trips. All facilities available.
106806,421263,5,Spikeyboy,08/01/2019,"A fabulous place to stay. If you like peace and quiet and want to stay in the countryside, rural Spain. Good cycling and walking in the area.  John and Saskia have route information in 3 languages. They are a lovely people and can't do enough to help their guests."
106806,411470,5,Bringamosa,02/12/2018,A wonderful place. Saskia and John receive you with open arms! facilities are perfect. Spacious bathroom with clean toilet and lovely hot shower. Wi-fi is doing well. We have not tried the pool at this time of the year. There is even a bakery and driving supermarket in the morning. Unfortunately we had just started and did not need anything.
106818,1345663,4,lorenzrub,20/07/2021,Quiet for a night.
106818,765840,3,RAFAVW,07/01/2020,Indeed gravel and concrete esplanade quite wide and with good access. It does not have any kind of service but perfect for a quiet night.
106833,2773019,4,stevenpp,21/05/2023,relatively well accessible with a utility vehicle (in dry weather) no problem turning around the only downside we encountered: an industrial quantity of midges
106833,2522890,1,CarolineLucasG,16/12/2022,"Place of meetings, even on weekdays, with in 5 mn of road on the way the meeting with 5 marauding cars, with men alone inside, who follow you, slow down at your height... Nice freak and change of destination ! Even if we are certainly not the target of these mr, it is not reassuring for a girl! Girls, choose another spot to have peace of mind"
106833,2156110,2,payasoloko,01/08/2022,"Good place to spend the day, but at sunset it was full of mosquitoes and bugs, to the point of having to leave because of all the ones there were."
106833,2090963,3,leonieviola,18/07/2022,Don't advise taking the route the maps suggest. Front tire slipped off the path. 5 stars for the help of the village community!!
106833,2047053,5,LaelT,07/07/2022,Place in the middle of nature which is very quiet day and night We were alone on the spot and had a perfect night We recommend this place!
106833,1853637,5,myju,26/04/2022,"great spot! however, be careful of the rising waters... we had to move to move back around 7:00 p.m. because the water rose constantly. and we had done well because the next day if we hadn't moved we would have had our feet in the water! so little advice to install rather towards the path than near the water! ideal for fishing"
106833,1643811,4,CapybaraBoomBoom,14/10/2021,"Very calm at night, precious spot right next to the river. You do hear traffic background in the distance but given that you're surrounded by nature while being so close to Zaragoza, it's acceptable. I would recommend only going when road is dry, by the road that goes along the river from Monzalbarba. Expect some fishermen around 8:30 in the morning."
106833,1456829,3,vieuxjames,14/08/2021,"The site is surely great but it was so hot and everything in the van was boiling hot that I did not take advantage of it as it should. It's not easy to find the way when no GPS other than Maps.me can find the access;) the path is accessible but maybe not for big sills. The path is rough in places, the water (for sprinkling?) Has made good holes but which by going there quietly passes (fiat ducato 6m van with conventional tires). The agricultural path that remains the least damaged is the one indicated by the GPS. When the path makes a Y I stayed on the left, the branches are very low. Then I finally we arrive. Otherwise it seems to me that there are a few small pitches along the path where you can land."
106833,1433158,4,philippinebm,10/08/2021,"Good spot, with a view of the city. I arrived late with my family and I was quiet there"
106833,762581,1,PedroPeterPizza,02/01/2020,"Warning!!! do not go down the little hill. If you wish to stop here do not follow the GPS coordinates down to the river. It was incredibly muddy and we had to get towed out. Possible to stay further away from the river, but not worth the long drive down there over poor road surfaces."
106833,758879,5,WaveKiter,29/12/2019,"Great, quiet place very close to Zaragoza.
There is a spot a couple of 100 m before the indicated site where several large vehicles can stay in case the road is muddy. We stayed there."
106833,640999,1,papy-61,18/08/2019,Actually I advise to approach on foot we stopped 900m from the GPS point there is a large place on the grass see the photo

I don't know if the owners of the bar encourage the workers to make noise because they don't want us to be there, or it's simply that there are a couple of workers who can't do enough and have to go out bothering us. That said, I will continue going but not one more euro here"
106936,3274785,1,LuisjaPR,09/09/2023,Overcrowded parking. They have removed the beach parking lot and replaced it with this one. They have taken all the charm out of the town. See you forever

We arrived on Friday night and we had no problem, it was practically empty. Saturday filled up quickly. If you go when the weather is good (from March/April to September/October) it is better to have plan B in case there is no room, especially weekends and holiday season."
106936,2605143,5,Yeliso,10/03/2023,"Good place for Motorhomes and Campers, there are no emptying or filling services, but it is a quiet area and just below there is a soccer field, more Motorhomes and Campers usually park next to it. To go to the center of town, it is a very close walk."

Quiet at night on the edge of the village where a 2 km hiking trail starts to the next larger beach. You are a bit higher and can therefore catch some wind. Some nice terraces and simple restaurants. 4/5G seems to switch between the 3 available providers throughout the day.

In the morning, parents bring their children to school. Garbage cans and a playground are nearby. Very good for dog lovers, since several paths lead to the sea. There are great views and a water point in the middle of the village as well as some restaurants and bars."

106936,2324676,5,joyan,31/08/2022,Good place to enjoy the town. In the same street a few meters before there is also parking with capacity for 10 campers. I do not recommend these parking spaces for motorhomes due to their dimensions. Very exposed air days due to the height

106936,1906393,5,anaispillet95,22/05/2022,perfect for a 6m long Van. this region is protected: you can park in a beach car park during the day and in the evening you must leave it. that's why this spot is ideal for sleeping. Next to a restaurant but it was mostly crowded at lunchtime. there is a coastal walk right next to it and this provides access to the following beaches. I recommend ! but very popular spot
106936,1901386,4,FamilieGeiger,19/05/2022,"Spent 4 nights here with no problems. From 6 p.m. it was mostly full here, during the day there were a few visitors to the restaurant in the parking lot. Nice area, you feel safe, playground right in front of you. At night it was noisy on 3 evenings but it was ok... No shade at the parking lot or playground.

106936,1879949,5,Casperdig,09/05/2022,"Good place to overnight. Cars parked but move off by early evening so worth parking nearby until they leave. Some noise from youngsters but that subsided as it got later in the evening. Plenty of cafe/restaurants in the village centre. Avoid the ice cream seller in a portable cabin, poor hygiene , licked his fingers before picking up a cone then put it in a paper sleeve. He wondered why I declined"

106936,1866066,5,bralonso,02/05/2022,"Mandatory stop! Spectacular situation with unbeatable views. Overnight is allowed. We stop to sleep whenever we pass through the area. Out of season, very quiet area. Several routes leave from the same car park. highly recommended"
106936,1862607,1,reynaldceline,30/04/2022,"Prohibited throughout the city to park with a cc....If you do, at your own risk! It's a city that benefits from the money we spend there!! Unfortunately the GC came to dislodge us at 10 p.m. (we were about 25 cc !!!) because the city is in the nature reserve ..... Avoid."
106936,1855825,5,txistufly,27/04/2022,"We were there a few years ago, and it remains the same, it has wonderful views and the town itself. Very quiet for sleeping, hardly any movement. No service, please be clean!"

106936,1750694,5,fammol,08/02/2022,"Nice place with a playground in front of the door and the starting point of a nice walk. It's just a parking lot so it may be that there are some cars parked in the evening/night. Our camper is 7.5m long and we were able to stand diagonally to the right without bothering others. If everyone joins up a bit, many campers will fit, so don't be too selfish please."
106936,1740079,5,volitans,23/01/2022,"We spent a few days in this beautiful little town, enjoyed their nice restaurants and shopped daily at the little shop. The parking lot was quiet at night and the walks around super beautiful.
Unfortunately during the weekend more campers arrived and the amount of toilet paper on the side of the trails (and small dogs poo) increased.
Please take your garbage with you and clean after your dogs."
106936,1735433,1,Falvarez.tec,16/01/2022,"In the same viewpoint it is impossible to park because it is pedestrianized and is accessed by stairs, therefore the location of this review is incorrect. The correct review is ID: 106936, created by Unicore"

106936,1584759,5,Seila1985,16/09/2021,"Site with spectacular views, easy access and capacity for large vehicles. It is part of the town, it is quiet and has a nearby supermarket and a restaurant. We spent a night without problems, it is in high demand and quickly takes care of it. We took a place because we arrived in the middle of the afternoon. It is not easy to find places like this where overnight stays are allowed."
106936,1571963,4,monauta,12/09/2021,"The site is good, so much so that it is difficult to find a gap, a few meters before it there is another parking area with capacity for about 6 vans or motorhomes and on the flat."

106936,1484272,5,lauranceverner62,19/08/2021,We slept two very quiet nights with incredible views. It must be respected since it is a part of the town and bad behavior will lead to not letting the night stay.
106936,1453666,5,Pakotinta,14/08/2021,"Quiet parking, excellent views, in the same town, nearby there is a store where you can buy ice and basic things. They fit between 7u8 campers.Free."

106936,1152723,5,ChrisJanz,17/03/2021,"Good level place, just right for a night, nothing more. Because it is on the edge of a residential area. A bit of dog barking, the sound of the sea and the garbage disposal at 11 p.m. could not be heard."

The tap in the square is closed. brutal as we dined at the senior citizen's bar on the corner!
106936,1058321,5,IsabelCharra,19/09/2020,"Small but comfortable parking, since there is no noise and it is quite level. The views from this one are fantastic. In front of the parking there are restaurants and behind it a playground."
106936,1055809,5,gemmaixavi,18/09/2020,Quiet sleeping area. There is a restaurant in front but from 00:00 there is no noise. Good views. Charming and very quiet town.
106936,1031158,3,Speknor,06/09/2020,"It is a parking lot that can fit about 5 ACs or camper on battery (It is not exclusive for AC). We went to make a route through the isleta del moro. From that point you can do several hiking trails. Very good views next to the viewpoint and very close to the beach. We did not spend the night, to eat we went to the other parking lot on the isleta del moro."
106936,1005786,3,KUN71,27/08/2020,"We spent a quiet night without dust, since it is not dirt. Nice views."
106936,824578,5,clavero76,14/06/2020,Very good. quiet and more level than the ground parking. good views from the viewpoint. some vans. I will repeat the next time I come here.
106936,782327,4,Angathome,18/02/2020,Stayed a couple of peaceful nights but be warned it is next to a restaurant so if they have a live band on (which they did  only on the Saturday night when we were there) it is loud and for us impossible to sleep!
106936,778787,5,Maxxbull,10/02/2020,"Recommended, very quiet night, excellent views. And the bar recommended quality / price. I will definitely repeat"
106936,744017,1,Terry319,16/11/2019,Arrived at 6pm police arrived at 8pm and told everybody to leave do not park here for the night
106936,743663,5,checholoko,16/11/2019,"We came here after the foresters kicked us out of the beach, they recommended it to us. Very quiet, good views, just another van and us."
106936,719876,5,Ratones3,12/10/2019,"Spectacular views and very quiet, enter it if it is somewhat complicated"
106936,685186,4,ignaaratos,10/09/2019,Taking advantage of having dinner in front (highly recommended by the way) we stayed in this parking lot. They fit about seven vehicles. No problem or noise. Quiet night and beautiful views as it is attached to the viewpoint. The sculptures and the adjacent coves are seen from here.
106936,447329,2,Mattzx6r,31/03/2019,Currently a store for building materials while they repair the road. Maybe it will be useful again in a couple months...
106936,434555,4,didiepunk,28/02/2019,"We had a good night, quiet, we were alone, lovely views of the coast and the mountains. Water point in the center of the village."
106936,429602,1,Txema69,15/02/2019,"It did not even look like parqin, it is a lot that you have to enter through a narrow street and it is hard to get in by climbing a very high curb, when there were not even cars, I would not go."
106936,400555,4,rosell,28/10/2018,Very quiet place we were at the end of octobre
106955,1698791,2,ilvytogo,27/11/2021,"Would have been here to fill up the water, but found no service."
106955,1279515,2,Vagabund_Rudi,26/06/2021,Good for one night. Thank you for sharing.
106955,439288,4,Occitania.Fr,12/03/2019,Quiet and trouble-free night. The road is far enough. Good morning boats come in so you have to get up early.
106963,1709496,4,evrett,13/12/2021,camping air and free van with playground for children the amenities area is closed very quiet place out of season with more or less clear view
106968,2877643,5,raffzger,21/06/2023,"Top place in a good location right on the lake. Occasionally fishermen come by. Thanks to the creator of the place! Stayed 5 days. Difficult approach (washed out, branches, slope)"
106968,1745030,3,LinaTina,31/01/2022,"Very nice, in the middle of nature. You are completely undisturbed. Meanwhile, unfortunately, but a little garbage here. Ideal place, olive trees, reservoir and tranquility. Approach a bit tedious via ""washboard slope""."
106968,1721386,5,angelus249,31/12/2021,"Awesome place. Spend New Year's Eve here and will probably stay a few days. Untouched nature, that's the way it should stay. No trash here and that's how I'll leave the place again. The journey was fun, that's exactly why you have a 4x4 vehicle!"
106969,3263878,3,DaliainKnaus,06/09/2023,Many small squares. Too inclined.
106969,3228956,2,centrodelsur,28/08/2023,"Inclined, small seats, noise from the electric transformer motor. we don't stay"
106969,3094886,4,kikopago,07/08/2023,"correct, not too big and a little inclined it is essential to go with a full water tank and clean the other tanks many restaurants where you can eat you can do a very cool excursion through the canyon"
106969,3073121,4,jlongo,04/08/2023,"Quiet parking, almost flat, Clean place Close to shops (restaurant, bakery...) 15 min walk from the balcony of Madrid We spent a quiet night there"
106969,3045984,3,Edikeli,30/07/2023,"Inclined squares, without services, but close to the town and quiet. We spent one night. Nearby, take the shuttle to go to the Monastery of Santa Cristina. You can also go to the viewpoint that is near the campsite."
106969,2960622,1,LaBichaBenimarSport323,13/07/2023,"Another example of a population that does not want motorhomes, there is a sign at the entrance to the town that forces you to park in this car park designed for cars, very small and crooked spaces, where it is impossible to even park. I saw the balcony of Madrid and ran out of there"
106969,2828143,4,Wollazize,07/06/2023,"Very quiet, close to children’s park, small shop and a few eateries. Google said tourist information should be open but wasn’t. Spaces are quiet small, a few are almost level. Good location to start the PR-G 98 walk."
106969,2665382,4,Noelm2017,12/04/2023,Very quiet. Small shop in the village and a baker. Good hiking opportunities.
106969,2569302,2,munibike,05/02/2023,"It is a parking lot for vehicles without more and motorhomes are obliged to park in this area, the rest of the town is prohibited since it is small and there is not much space."
106969,2479578,4,rponce,02/11/2022,"Good place to park and spend the night, although it is somewhat inclined, but very quiet"
106969,2479314,4,alejandro.oute,02/11/2022,A little steep but well signposted.
106969,2429449,4,Frankiti,07/10/2022,"Since an area is being made that is very much appreciated, think that they are going to make it for motorhomes, which by the way is not a tourism (in case someone does not know). Spending €55"
106969,2362574,3,EcoFoco,11/09/2022,"Wide and paved site, in the upper part of the town. We spent the night, there were more travelers."
106969,2292292,4,vigopla,23/08/2022,"Very good site made by the town hall. One minute from the town, with bars, restaurants, supermarket, bakery... The squares have a lateral inclination, those of the upper part a little less. We spent a very quiet night, only that a tourist bus may arrive first thing in the morning."
106969,2181017,4,web_van,05/08/2022,"Very quiet to sleep. The city council is to be thanked for the effort to do it, but the squares are a bit narrow and it is inclined. On the other hand, in the town, do not forget to go to the bakery (bread, bica, muffins, empanadas and the majísima la Señora), eat at Casa Mercedes (Spanish omelette for 10) and do the PR G 98 trail. We have enjoyed it a lot! !"
106969,2159234,5,siggimueller,01/08/2022,"Good parking lot, newly prepared a bit sloping but you can sleep well :-)"
106969,2045001,4,MayMariMor,06/07/2022,We were alone and had a very quiet night. No services but good option to spend the night.
106969,1894126,4,manolo57,16/05/2022,"Good parking, well located, easy action although a little uneven. In the town there is the O Curtiñeiro restaurant where you can eat very well at a good price."
106969,1883019,4,Daviz,11/05/2022,"Sitiu very new and quiet, the only bad thing is that it is on the slope, but with some chocks it can be fixed. Nearby is Pepe's store, a bar-store with lots of things and very nice people, especially Pepe, the owner, who also lets you sleep in a farm that is close to the bar."
106969,1562140,3,RikarNoodles,09/09/2021,"It is a parking lot on the outskirts of town. It is not ""badly done"" for being inclined. It is designed to park vehicles, not to sleep in them despite this, there are some sufficiently flat spaces. Given the area where it is located (little space in general) the parking is quite good."
106969,1552543,2,PatasFurgoesvida,06/09/2021,"A shame that being new has such a steep slope, it seems that it is done wrong on purpose. Still we spent a quiet night to visit the sil canyon."
106969,1513231,3,viajoluegoexisto,25/08/2021,"Place with a slope next to the road but very close to the town, if you park in the maneuvering area as happened to us, there is no one to turn around because the lane is narrow, ideal for exploring the Sil canyon, very close from the viewpoint balcones de Madrid"
106969,1504154,1,Xtremtravel,23/08/2021,Pathetic !! What a sloppy parking lot. It is the worst parking I have seen in years !!
106969,1483711,3,furgopandi,19/08/2021,"Very good, quiet, but with a lot of uneven parking"
106969,1468790,2,cbertran,16/08/2021,"It is good that they have made a parking for motorhomes but since they were doing it, they could have leveled it. There is also a lack of water services. The squares are very small. No way 40 motorhomes. 40 campers, maybe."
106969,1438477,4,enricijuliafurgo,11/08/2021,Very quiet at night. Most of the plots are uneven but there are at least 6 pitches that are almost 100% flat. We did not have falcas and we have slept very well and accompanied by 10 motorhomes and campers.
106969,1402811,1,Vanesavb,04/08/2021,"As the name indicates to make a stop .... Small and very inclined sites, not even with chocks .... For the amount of site that there is in the town and the motorhome tourism that it has, they could have conditioned it more. I recommend the bakery."
106969,1391224,4,annairaul,01/08/2021,We have spent two nights and very well. It is true that the squares are small and inclined but to go to sleep it is correct. No services. Great for excursions in that area.
106969,1379962,3,ElChispi71,29/07/2021,"Perfect to visit the Monastery of Santa Cristina, since a bus leaves from the Concello that brings you and takes you for €2 and the entrance to the Monastery is included. The driver is very friendly and gives you a lot of information. Going down with the motorhome is not a good idea because the road is very narrow and below there is no parking for our vehicles. To sleep you have to put on shoes."
106969,1372655,1,sarish89,27/07/2021,"The only place in town where vans can park. It's a shame because it is an esplanade with very small squares and with a lot of inclination. More than to spend the night, it is designed to park for a while."
106969,1326717,1,MIBR,15/07/2021,"As it is a new AC car park and the only one there is, they could have done a little bit of care. Car-size spaces, without any service, no shade and a lot of unevenness. It seems that they are not interested in this type of visit."
106969,1324817,3,BinaWa,14/07/2021,"New designated place without any service. Pretty sloping, no space is straight! therefore deduction of the points. Grocery store very close, also mini-Beckerei in town, many bars and restaurants. Still very calm. Quaint hiking trails with quaint trees. Great view of the gorge (Balcones de Madrid). Monasterio de Santa Christina worth seeing. We stayed 2 nights"
106969,1322493,4,oskrcali,14/07/2021,It's very nice. near the town and routes. you can walk to the balcony of Madrid. It is somewhat uneven.
106969,1308685,4,Nabarniz,09/07/2021,"Authorized overnight. Specific area by length for motorhomes. Shuttle bus to the monastery, check timetables at Casa do Concello, located down 200 m. It is worth getting off to visit the Sil River viewpoint. Good reception."
106969,1304686,3,1978Canto,08/07/2021,No services. Inclined parking. We spent the night in the squares in the back. We were 2 cars of 7 m. a fugue. The sunset is very beautiful. Very nice locals. The balcony of Madrid very cool. A park nearby. And bars and the town too. In the infoturist they gave us maps and everything was very well explained.
106969,1297348,1,Luca9,04/07/2021,"Ashamed, I don't know what engineer would think of making an inclined sleeping place, or a shadow. I do not recommend it."
106969,1277275,1,hyper9,25/06/2021,"Not suitable for overnight with AC. Without services, with a lot of unevenness. Impossible for large ACs and small ones can only park if several of the adjoining spaces are not occupied. It is actually a car park."
106969,1185428,3,eisenherz,04/05/2021,Unfortunately the description is wrong. There are no services there and it is forbidden to stay overnight according to the signs. Very well located as a parking lot for day trips. The hiking routes pass here and a tourist information center is only a few meters away.
106969,1157954,5,MicSimo,26/03/2021,"Excellent parking for trekking to the balcones de Madrid and the monasteiro de santa cristina. We didn't sleep there but it felt very quiet and peaceful, just a bit sloping."
106969,1037719,2,Fernandotkd,09/09/2020,"I do not recommend it, it is asphalted, very steep and no camping signs also there are three places for buses the rest for cars, if you park next to the AC you do not go out To get there VERY BAD roads. And there is only a viewpoint and possibilities to walk It is not worth going"
106969,1019405,3,bouyoco,01/09/2020,Parking to stop and eat or spend the day. See the Balcony of Madrid. To spend the night it is inclined.
106969,1008862,2,Matildabidaiari,28/08/2020,"To park and spend the day well, but I do not see it to spend the night, on a slope"
106969,1005026,3,furgofrd,26/08/2020,"Nonsense area, all the squares on a slope"
106969,957382,3,Lagus,13/08/2020,"Clean, quiet and paved area, although without services and sloping (not intended for motorhomes). Enough to visit the town, the viewpoint of Madrid and spend one night. She was very busy this day."
106969,851454,3,Lukil,06/07/2020,"Very good initiative of the city council. It only has a parking lot that is not very well leveled, but to spend the night it does the trick."
106969,838890,3,jafaga,27/06/2020,Great initiative but with little logic. They are sloping car seats. It has no shade so if the sun hits you can get too hot. We park in some places under the trees between this parking and the Pepe area with car and karavana
106969,748982,4,mpestana,01/12/2019,We sleep peacefully next to another motorhome. It is simply a parking lot and is uneven.
106969,657277,3,a.e.b,24/08/2019,"In principle we chose to sleep in the parking of the viewpoints, more spacious and looks like a cool place. But the kids in the town use the parking lot to spin at 2 at night ... ... so we changed places during the night and went to sleep here. It looks like a parking lot and it is ..... but it is a quiet place"
106969,655309,4,porterosbe,24/08/2019,"Good parking, in the town indicated as motorhome area but does not have services, poorly leveled parking except a few places that are better, quiet place of recent construction we spend the night just us and a large volume."
106969,499004,4,LDVgirl,31/05/2019,"Very quiet during the night, seems like no one is using the car park for whatever reason. Lots of hikes around, pretty village, lots of bars and restaurant in walking distance. In my opinion much better then the other carpark in the village. 
Lots of space."
106974,2872182,1,tonigoyi,19/06/2023,"after spending 12 euros on washing and drying. When I have finished and start to fold the clothes I see that the clothes have not fit well if not dirty, I imagine it was due to lack of soap. I do not recommend"
106974,2612837,4,tinothevan,17/03/2023,Good place with very close parking inside Dia supermarket. Only 2 washing machines and a dryer and if you find them busy you have to wait.. 10€ for 18kg and 5€ for 8kg. The dryer €3 for 20 min
106974,2510944,2,Rberg,02/12/2022,the 18 kilo machine is not working at the moment and the one small washing machine was occupied when we were here
106974,1909775,5,MAMrodriguez,23/05/2022,"Great wash! 5€ for 8kgs / 10€ for 18kgs! On the other hand for this kind of machine, I have been had several times: for drying now I put 20min ""high caliente"" the highest otherwise it dries nothing .. usually it damages the laundry so I don't like it, but with these self-service machines, there is no choice."
106974,1846121,1,jppp,22/04/2022,"If you have any problems with the washing machine, the Dia manager will suggest that you learn Spanish so that you can call for service in the event of a washing machine malfunction. Avoid Dia as well as the laundry service. There is another 200 meters in front of Mercadona"
106974,1221988,5,Mariejahnne31,28/05/2021,"Alright, in Dia's parking lot"
106974,718870,4,JWobbly,11/10/2019,1x18 kg wash machine and 1 x 8kg wash machine and one tumble dryer. All in good condition but nowhere to sit or table to fold clothes. Also quite expensive. Used 18kg machine which cost 10 euro inc detergent and softener plus 2 euro for every 15 min of drying. Came away 14 euro lighter but clothes were clean and it’s nice to have the facility even if it is expensive!
106974,407417,5,Sissi22,14/11/2018,"Thank you Dia. Super practical. Opposite, a cafeteria bakery to pass the time after the races."

107033,713914,2,gabrielafernandes,05/10/2019,"Extremely rocky road, felt very sketchy driving through at night. No flat grounds to park, just a sandy road where you definitely can not park. Beginning of the road is a flat piece by the wall where we parked."

107039,2546307,1,gila,08/01/2023,"development area. Dead end. Not approved for over 3.5. Parking small, tight, you have to turn around to drive down. certainly no place to stay!"
107039,2501305,2,LupiDj,20/11/2022,Too much noise to spend the night. The views along a road to El Corazón de Jesús Impressive and a panoramic view 500 meters from the entire bay of Mazarrón.
107039,2032226,3,camago13,03/07/2022,In summer it is full of mosquitoes. At night there is noise from people coming and going to the restaurant but bearable. Good views and peaceful awakening.
107039,1941620,2,mlolo,03/06/2022,"The site is very good, next to the lighthouse and with very nice views. The catch is a gas-oil generator for a communications antenna that is next to the parking lot. It is very noisy. We had to go."
107039,1806667,5,Lafufudbixi,04/04/2022,Perfect place for van. We spent the night. Beautiful views. Very calm. The restaurant is not open yet. From there you can walk to the sides of Mazarrón port. I recommend it.
107039,651242,1,TuyYo,22/08/2019,"We spent one night there, beautiful views. Very touristic city, parking with a lot of inclination and narrow. Without signaling a motorhome ban, but at 23h they informed us that it was a private parking lot (for the restaurant people) and we had movement of people / cars until 4 in the morning."

There is a waste disposal service, electricity and sink, parking spaces in front of a park with grills and children's entertainment, right on the banks of the Tagus River in a village with 300 inhabitants. We recommend!"
107064,3036463,1,PaulaPereiri,28/07/2023,We arrived to stay overnight but the gate was closed and no motorhome parked. The site appears to be excellent and calm but the area may not be open or completed yet.
107064,2976914,1,Miguel.AFuentes,17/07/2023,"A week ago we arrived at night, there was a car almost at the entrance, measured not to let in. In the end we slept on the street above, very quiet. But it was a chore."

107064,2897658,4,Montanerosviaje,27/06/2023,"It has 6 exclusive spaces for motorhomes, long and wide with some shade. The place is ideal with picnic tables and barbecues down by the river (bathing is not possible). The place is ideal with a playground and shadows. It's a pity that no service works, there is no water or chemical toilet :("
107064,2877981,5,Laviexlavraie,21/06/2023,"Spent a night there with my Volvo station wagon. Very quiet place next to a park with some benches and shade. A café 2min away run by a very friendly manager, where you can go to the toilet. You can eat an exceptional rib steak there for a ridiculously low price. At this time the water is off at the RV site. I think it will be activated again for the summer."

107064,1861101,4,Roel964,30/04/2022,"Place name Arripiado. If you drive ""down"" from the parking lot, you are in a perfect position, possibly with vistas to the water. Shaded picnic tables, BBQ's, kitchen counter. Brightly lit at night. Soft traffic noise from the other side and the occasional (freight) trains disturb the idyllic picture."
107064,1819310,4,rithas,13/04/2022,"Super place, quiet and clean, you could also drive directly to the shore with a barbecue area and table. There's also a faucet there, but without a thread. We were alone during the week, probably well attended at the weekend."

Very quiet, without noise or light, which made the place something enchanted and we didn't feel unsafe, despite sleeping alone there, space for many caravans (I believe they are installing lighting in the coming months, because poles without lamps have already been installed).

Be careful where you park, because when you want to go out, you can't. There is a yellow container and other garbage, although I think people should not see them because of the amount of garbage on the ground."

Totally worth it though!!"
107098,1181111,2,cacharrafamily,28/04/2021,"Only one long square for car or van, the others are battery-powered and it stands out a lot, cutting off the access of emergency vehicles to the forest track."

At 20:20 we entered the supermarket and we left at 20:45 finding us a complaint of the Local police because the bike rack occupied some of the sidewalk that we have not seen a single pedestrian pass. What a welcome to the city.
107128,1717270,2,travelthedogs,28/12/2021,"The first decent place i found in the dark after the pyrenees. I slept great, but at 6 in the morning the staff of mercadona started unloading a truck with forklifts which was very noisy and took very long! So better park in front of mercadona instead of in the back."
107128,751791,3,Acm2,09/12/2019,"The police came to the motorhome area and those of us in the bus part threw us out, recommended that we come here. Quiet place, straight, wide near the Mercadona and without any trouble sleeping. A little further from the center but not much."

The problem is that we decided to leave because it was the town's festivals, blaring music and nervous pets. But hey, the parties are normal, they are 3 days a year and there is no problem for changing places."

The faucets are inside the booth that you see in the photo and it is very dirty. In the gray grid there is no slope, so if you are not directly above the grid, everything goes towards the road. A pity."
107203,2591050,5,Siven,25/02/2023,"Ample parking with the possibility of free water change service. Good floor but no shadows. Ideal as a stage. There are two areas to change the water, with a correct state of cleanliness."

107203,2491262,2,CSP06,11/11/2022,"It is located in a school car park, so it is quite busy on weekdays. To empty water and toilet is fine but the filling part is very disgusting... We took advantage of the fact that very close there is a laundry (Nai clean), by the way its owner is very kind."

107203,2438133,4,vinckje,11/10/2022,Arrived on October 4 for 1 night. Half of the mobile home parking was occupied by piles of sand. Workers were building a new square for the future retirement home. The parking lot was big enough to move to another spot. Service station not used. Had a quiet night. Nice village but we actually came for the tobacco shop.
107203,2435350,5,jma12,10/10/2022,"Double area located on a large car park near schools and sports facilities. Very quiet, easy access to the greenway, free services. We stayed there for 2 nights. To visit: the artesian well at 500m. Congratulations to the municipality."

The inside of the cabinet with the clean water taps needs cleaning and upgrading. Cover of black water emptying box without signaling. Ideal to take a break from the journey, use the services and visit the town of Cella. Quite close to the A-23 motorway."

107203,2243182,4,Capora,15/08/2022,"Very good place due to its size and proximity to the town which, on the other hand, is very good if you want to visit its Sierra bakery, or one of its bars. It is worth getting off the highway to stop there."
107203,2152190,3,TelleriaEli,31/07/2022,"Thanks to the council! Good area. Although there are only 4 places marked, the parking lot is very large. Good access. Correct filling and emptying. The town is worth a visit. To improve it, a little shade would be appreciated."

107203,2054992,5,Felisuco2021,09/07/2022,"Pretty quiet place to spend the night. Enough space to park. If it had any more streetlights, for everyone's safety, it would be better."

It is always good for a city council to cede land and make a place available to the people where they can rest and recover. but the facilities seem to be half finished. the taps are hidden and quite dirty, the emptying of the WC is poorly marked. but it is still a good initiative of the city council"

The first time we had to leave because a group of 8-9 children were having fun throwing firecrackers at the motorhome and banging on the garage door. a pity The second time there were more motorhomes and there were no problems with firecrackers. The poty is emptied into the sewer, and there is no tap next to it to wash it. Small open space next door for those who have a dog."

The grey and black water waste is very good, the fresh water tap is very severe .All was very quiet until midnight when a group of loud , probably drunk youths appeared, they started shouting"

107203,747064,4,padraigl,25/11/2019,"This is a large tarmac parking area with free services in front of the school that has NO dedicated parking spaces for motorhomers. It's suitable for large motorhomes and caravans. The side road entrance has a very tight right turn and is narrow but if you continue to the roundabout and come in from the back of the school it's easier.

Pros:
Free parking.
Free full services excluding electricity.
Local supermarket, restaurant, cafes and bars.

Cons:
No shade.

There are full free services excluding electricity. There are actually 2 grey bays beside each other with a central fresh water cabinet in-between.

The grey drains have NO flow direction into the grate so your waste pipe needs to be over the grate or the waste water will go everywhere.

The black WC drain is at ground level under a steel cover with a chain. The drain is large with no splashback.
There is no dedicated cassette tap and it's impossible to use the taps in the cabinet so you will have to use your hose to clean the cassette.

There are 2 fresh water taps in a concrete cabinet with a steel door, each tap facing towards a hole in the wall. Best way is to put the hose through the hole to connect to the tap. They are both medium screw-on connection with excellent pressure. They have 3/4 turn handle to regulate the flow.

There are large bins in the carpark.

There are cafe/bars close-by. We had 2 very quiet but very cold nights here on our own. We arrived on a Saturday and left on a Monday. The weekend was very quiet bar a soccer match in the stadium on the Sunday. Monday morning was a little busy with kids being left off for school.
There are some walks in the countryside and we found a 2km running circuit to warm up the bones.

Bugs/Mosquitoes. (They love us..)
We did not encounter any mosquitoes here in the end of November. It was very cold as we were above 1000 meters."

At this spot if you walk down the street little further there was a lot of trash between the bushes. For sure not all of it was by people who park there for night but at least something.

107675,3045786,5,ManuLara,30/07/2023,"Perfect to arrive late, spend the night and the next day go to the beach. They usually put the vans and the AC in the trees that are entering to the right, if you park there they will not move you at 8. Let's respect these places so that they continue to let us spend the night."

The stream is dry, we intuit that because it is summer and the time it has not rained. We are located as soon as we enter on the left, under the shade of two trees. The gap is minimal. It's close to the road and you can hear the motorbikes especially, but we don't feel that bothersome. The site is frequented by pedestrians, cyclists and people walking their dogs.

107779,833405,4,AGasulla,23/06/2020,"Parking highly recommended. It is a very large esplanade and quite well leveled. It has easy access. There is no type of parking indication, so in principle they can park both vans and motorhomes. Located next to the road, just before entering the town, but it is very quiet and there is not much noise at night. Next door is a school. We had no problems, but I imagine that there will be more noise in the morning at school. It has NO SOURCE of water. The only one nearby is across the road, in front of the tourist office, but when we went, it was sealed."
107779,719729,4,Juju_carrada,12/10/2019,Very quiet parking There has been no noise during the night. Near the center of town. Without services
107786,2662155,4,Krux,11/04/2023,"Arriving on a holiday they charged us 5 euros and we didn't even have bathrooms in the morning. The bar during the week opens and closes when it wants. Of course, the place deserves a mandatory visit, which well compensates the cost of parking. We also had a sunset that is not forgotten"
107786,2624457,5,lidi_ss,25/03/2023,"We have stayed one night together with 3 other vans/AC and very well. We arrived at 7:00 p.m. and the bar was already closed, the next morning they didn't charge us the €5. The parking lot was already full at 12 noon"
107786,2615778,4,blimthepixie,19/03/2023,"Great spot for the walk. We arrived at night so didn't have to pay the new €5 charge.

Bar is open from 0930 to 2000 on the days it is open and they let you use the toilets.

Apart from that no services apart from the bins.

Carpark is most level near the bottom where you access it."
107786,2612354,4,saintamour,17/03/2023,A good walk and a big surprise when you arrive at the viewpoints. The parking lot is large and a little steep. Paid in season I think. No service except a trash can. Very little shade.
107786,2587986,4,ingridcrnc,23/02/2023,"We stayed just for one short night during the week, bar was closed so we weren’t ask to pay 5€. Not ideal because it’s on a slant. However, the view from the Cárcavas de Burujón is amazing !"
107786,2574445,3,taimiguel,11/02/2023,"As of today, people from the town hall ask for €5 to park and have cut off the accesses for vehicles that go to the ravines, which are very beautiful and worth it. There are a lot of people, although it is Saturday and I suppose that during the week it will be different. We spent the night in a quieter area near the reservoir."
107786,2492624,4,vekigo,12/11/2022,"Although during the day, especially during the day, the places fill up quickly, at night it is very quiet. There is a bar and it is the starting point of the route, which is not demanding. The access and parking itself is dirt and not very level, but in general it is highly recommended."

The second 2.35km are mostly a single trail.Trousers and good shoes recommended.Not for kids without experience.To climb the last steps,bring a stone."

107805,2535480,5,Nanaka,31/12/2022,"Super quiet night. The car park is divided into two heights, I recommend entering the lower one, it is wider and more manoeuvrable. A 5-minute walk from the town and it is the starting point of the water route. We spent one night with our young children and we felt comfortable and safe."
107805,1764428,4,ComplicesDuales,24/02/2022,"A quiet place, the town's water source is cut off due to drought, so I recommend filling up in Finestrat or Relleu before coming here, there are currently some works nearby but they only make noise with radials sporadically. A beautiful town to spend 1 or 2 days, I recommend doing the water route and buying an ""espardenya"" in the town's oven, it is a typical oil cake from here."

Some places are not well leveled, but in general, very well. In the town there is a fountain where you can load water. On New Year's Eve all the people have dinner in the main square and after the chimes of the church a party with live music. We will be back!"

107829,2847517,4,juanini,12/06/2023,"It is a good place to spend the night with bars, a fountain and a supermarket nearby. The problem may be in the summer season or on weekends because young people with loud music and a desire to have fun naturally gather. For the rest, Trassierra is a very quiet area, with countless hiking trails such as Fuente del Elefante, Pozo de las Nieves, Baños de Popea."

When you look over the edge of the parking you'll see the (in our case empty) unpaved parking and the way to enter it. The unpaved parking is nice, flat and quiet. It's in a valley with very nice views, so also sounds from the village will be amplified and echo-ing. From the beginning of the evening untill the morning a large dog barked his lungs out"

update - leaving was nearly impossible as it's so busy and ppl block the exits, we had to go out the exit and I had to stop all traffic to get us out. Not fun!"

Please be considerate of others and do not leave garbage or towels in the bushes, do not leave the gray water open leaving horrible puddles under the ac, do not take out chairs, tables and awnings, as it is a parking lot, not a campsite. We have to give a good image to motorhomes. If we continue to do it wrong in the end they will put up a height barrier, and with good reason."

All bays, whether belonging to Murcia or Almeria, are equipped with garbage containers. In the palm and Carolinenbucht police and authorities keep checking that everything is right. Different bakers come by every day to sell bread and pastries. Bärbel, a German bakery comes Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. Also with sausage and other treats."

107952,746397,5,izumiberat,23/11/2019,Very nice. The children enjoyed exploring the caves and fishing shrimp. We also tasted jellyfish for the first time. We stayed two nights without problem. There are two small vans that pass with bread in the morning.
107952,736250,4,zurix,02/11/2019,It is a very nice place. At the entrance there is a sign prohibiting camping with fines of 3000 euros but we have spent 2 nights without problems. It is a pity that such an environment is muddied with people who take EVERYTHING out of their vehicles and allow their dogs to walk loose without surveillance and to poop on a beach where children play. With such acts we will get them to put a barrier.
107952,735377,5,adventures_of_tobyk,01/11/2019,This is the best place we have found so far. The beach is perfect for children and also dog friendly. There are no services. Very friendly campers. We didn't want to leave! Highly recommend.

Since about 12 other campers stayed there, it was a bit tight. But the view of the beach and the sea is very nice and the wide sandy bay invites you to relax. Great short walk over to the spectacular neighboring bay."
107952,409604,5,nonacharlotte,23/11/2018,"We loved the Cuatro Calas. We stayed here for 2 nights while just having a lunch break. Stroll from one Cala to the others by a path along the coast. 1 van and 3 motorhomes, the 1st night. Each well spaced parking is great. We were on the left with sea view leaving space at the beach access for vehicles that would like to park the day. But on the 2nd night, 2 Czech motorhomes passed us by the side and installed next to us right next to us. We only saw them. If they could put themselves on the sand directly, they would have done it. But not counting on the non education of some, the site is superb. Garbage cans on the parking lot."

Only downside which has nothing to do with the spot itself but rather with the disrespectful people who go there and leave behind the vestiges of their festive passage. We have collected your waste. PARTYING WHILE LEAVING THE PLACE CLEAN IS POSSIBLE!"
107955,1295480,4,ClaireDutreuilh,04/07/2021,"Large picnic area. We were able to park the van under the trees. We were alone for the night.

It is very quiet to spend the night, there is no traffic in the area and you can only be woken up by the birds at dawn. There is a bicycle lane and a pedestrian zone up to the town. And you can rent electric skates from the town to the soccer field, which is a short walk from the area. For about €6 you can return by taxi."

107971,2562366,5,Detourer,28/01/2023,"A great spot near to the beach with good walking routes into Rota. The Apparkya app is very simple to use for paying the 5€ per 24 hours fee, which we had to do each day. You can risk an 80€ fine if you don't pay. Maximum stay allowed is 72 hrs."

107971,2435307,4,ayperbla,10/10/2022,"A perfect place to take a short bike route to the city or go to the beach, which is a 1-minute walk away. The only drawback is that the water drainage area is somewhat dirty and broken."
107971,2431156,1,apalmapt,08/10/2022,The place for parking is spacious but very unfriendly… it should be paid by an app that doesn’t work. We try 5 different types of debit and credit cards. The fresh water and to drain is free.. we opt to leave to other facilities a little further.

107971,2372353,4,Scote,14/09/2022,"From July 2022, €5 will be paid throughout the year and €72 hours for a limited time. It seems that they do not monitor but they do monitor and the fine is €80. They have limited the area of the pine forests and they are also €5 and 72 hours. Starting in October, you can also pay on Avda where the motorhomes are located that are not in the area. €80 fine and no one can take it away from you. the long seasons for foreigners are over."
107971,2367568,3,Charlie_21,13/09/2022,"If there is no festival in the adjacent park, it is a quiet place near the beach. 5 euros per day, with the service offered, is ok. Maximum length of stay: 72 hours. It is checked occasionally, the fine is 80 euros! From October, the same conditions apply to the adjacent Avenida Punta Candor, where many campers park."
107971,2340444,4,Vanrrenka,05/09/2022,"It was full, so we parked on the next road, and the truth is that we slept very well. It was the night of August 13."

The place has 20 pitches but a few without embarrassment grabbed 3 places for CCs that could have fit on one. The place is safe and the price of 5€ more than reasonable for 24 hours.

If you go to sleep from 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. you do not even need to pay, but €5 for 24 hours. The people are very nice, the only drawback is that there are not many places."
107971,2170701,3,tania1985,03/08/2022,Great spot to park and go to punta candor beach which is very nice one. The grey /black water place is quite outdated there are wholes on the floor and permanent dirty water on the floor. Sometimes a bit smelly probably because of trash bins. Can be a bit noisy at night.
107971,2154719,1,fbot,01/08/2022,"very noisy place. at night traffic of motorcycles and cars and people. also those who come to get water from the tap. at the moment a work nearby and from 8 in the morning more noise. beach very close. water emptying and filling included in the 5 euros, although you can do it without paying. On the same avenue there are dozens of caravans parked, and from what they say, the police say nothing."
107971,2134785,5,RuliVanLife,28/07/2022,"We have been in a car park next door that also has a row enabled and is closer to the beach. Very quiet place, the police made their rounds there too. In high season €5/24h is paid by app. recommendable"

Quiet at night and at the foot of an impressive beach. 3/4 km from the town, you can walk although there is a bus stop at the exit of the area. The area is paid with a mobile application Many thanks to the City Council for its construction, although its maintenance should improve."
107971,2121372,3,hasenteufel,25/07/2022,the VE is very old and not very hygienic. We still recommend the place because it is close to the beach and quiet.
107971,2094951,5,EmilioEsquivel,19/07/2022,"The Area is in very good condition except for the gray water drainage area, which has been in poor condition for several years. I think the City Council has made a mistake by putting that type of application, to be able to park. The proof is that before it was full, and now more than 6 places occupied I have not seen on the occasions that I have visited."
107971,2065438,5,Abrah,12/07/2022,"Site very well located to go to the beach that is formidable, with a beach bar to eat luxury on the beach. Rota far, there is a bus that takes you to the center. To pay the €5 overnight you must download an application, it is indicated by the entrance to the parking lot. On weekends a lot of people. To put a snag filling the clean water very slowly, tap without thread and push"
107971,2028155,4,gersansi,01/07/2022,"It is very well located, although it is a 40-minute walk from the center... it has a beach and a beach bar with bathrooms nearby... Some maintenance would be needed, especially in the emptying area... the tap, it would be good if they changed it for thread since a lot of water is lost. I hope that now with the collection there is more movement since it shows that there are a few who have been half camped there for a long time."

Thank you, we will return ...."

Great place to spend a few days, loading and unloading water and plenty of room inside the area and outside too. Thanks to the town hall for this area, in high season a little control, with 72 hours is enough"
107971,1922702,4,loppieontour,27/05/2022,"Nice place on the beach. Unfortunately, many places have been occupied for a long time by people who spend their holidays there. Spent 2 quiet nights."

107971,1826639,3,papple,16/04/2022,"The position is good, especially for not too large vehicles. Very bad the long sedentary lifestyle of many, mostly Spaniards. Maybe it's the result of the holy week holidays. In any case, it is a very useful service, to be kept efficient and clean. A little further on, there is plenty of space for many campers. Calm."
107971,1824278,5,anemiqueve,15/04/2022,"The site is very good, no noise at night and you can go to the town on skates in 10 minutes on a good path. The beach is next door and there is a beach bar to have a few drinks. Oh, and best of all, it's full of super social and cuddly kitties. There are foreigners who do not move from their site but do not bother."
107971,1821458,5,karinchristian,14/04/2022,"The small space in front is very narrow, only for small vehicles. The large square behind it is blocked with long-term campers, who will ensure that the community will close it soon, even if I read the Spanish comments here. We were 200 m further ahead at the football stadium."

Rota City Council should regulate that."

This weekend there would be about 400 between settlers and surroundings. It doesn't surprise me that later they ban us everywhere...yes, this is like a town. The water area is somewhat dirty and neglected. The civil guard passes from time to time."

107971,1741417,3,Fernandotkd,26/01/2022,The loading and unloading area is a bit dirty but it is due to the number of motorhomes in the surroundings. If it's like this in January I can't imagine in the summer
107971,1724981,1,nomad51,03/01/2022,"Parking fields very narrow. The sanitary installations are primitive, shabby, the opposite of hygienic."
107971,1708892,4,Francesco57,12/12/2021,"Great place, free loading and unloading. Quiet nights and the town of Rota, about 1.8km away, is well worth a relaxing tour. Beautiful beaches and temperatures around 20 degrees."
107971,1706705,5,plisflops,08/12/2021,"A bit small for such a touristy place. The area is great, beach, park, restaurant, the correct services. If you can't find a place in it, there is a lot of space outside where you can park. Quiet area, perfect for walking with dogs, children, and visiting Avenida de Almudena Grandes."
107971,1704972,5,App84,06/12/2021,"A fantastic area with many motorhomes, fantastic place, quiet, noiseless and safe. With water discharge and loading area. We spent the night without problems. We will return, although it is true that in summer the beaches are very crowded and it is different. Recommendable."
107971,1704922,5,ManuMartinez81,06/12/2021,"Optimal public area to spend the night. very quiet, you can even leave things outside the van without being stolen (I'm not talking about camping) Next to a wonderful beach with a beach bar for coffee, lunch, dinner and a drink. Much better than what you find in other nearby towns."
107971,1703863,5,Hjot,05/12/2021,"optimal parking space, many thanks to the Rota community. Clean, marked spaces, service area for black / gray / fresh water in the central parking area. More spacious parking spaces in the area, but also very well used. No turning circle for large motorhomes."
107971,1703059,3,Depaula,04/12/2021,"Ideal place to visit Rota or go to the beach, quiet, safe and with the basics to empty. You can walk to the center by bike or take a walk along the edge of the beach. There is also a bus every half hour (number 2) € 1.15 the trip is paid on the same bus and the stop is 50 m away. In summer time I don't know what it will be like."
107971,1694128,4,Wolle2,20/11/2021,"A big thank you to the city of Rota, you have ""done everything right"". A beautiful beach, great bike paths, shopping centers are also easy to reach and everything is free, whether water or disposal. We will definitely come back when we come over here."

107971,1655926,4,Lokedigalarubia,21/10/2021,Area with filling and emptying services for gray and black water. Very quiet for the night. In front of Candor beach and the bus stop that takes you to the center (line 2) The baker usually passes through the area between 9:30 a.m. and 10 a.m.
107971,1639200,4,raquevan,11/10/2021,"Free area with a beautiful beach next to it. The drinking water tap has no thread and cannot be easily attached to any hose. Areas of gray water discharge and black water that can be improved but acceptable, where the gray water creates puddles, better to park far away. Sometimes the baker passes around 10am in a white van."
107971,1638501,4,carchanco,11/10/2021,"In a privileged environment, with a long and almost deserted beach. Walking to Rota takes about 30/40 min. With the possibility of emptying, the most complicated filling because it is a flat-mouth tap. I would repeat for the environment and the tranquility."
107971,1638132,4,Nuevosmun2,11/10/2021,"Gratuitous. Very quiet to sleep. DISADVANTAGE: the drain to empty the gray water overflows, and makes a path to where we are parked. ADVANTAGE: CEPSA is very close to the Amazon locker called ""flowers"" that you never know if we are going to need something urgently. Beach next door to see some incredible sunsets. We would return."
107971,1635382,4,tonio35ast,09/10/2021,"The area is fine. Now it is free and there is no stay limit. Next to the beach, with a bike path to get to rota. The worst thing I saw was that to fill water the tap is not adaptable, and for gray water it is somewhat difficult, but in general it is very good. Very calm"
107971,1614154,1,ROANGO,28/09/2021,"The Rota City Council has still dismantled the beach showers in front of our noses, it sends balls and we cannot remove the sand from our bodies."
107971,1594486,3,Pastorcinnn,20/09/2021,"The area is great and with the beach very close, unfortunately the abuse is free and we are condemned to extinction, motorhomes that live there, parked cars of the motorhome owners to move, I wish there was a maximum stay time or a minimum price for there to be rotation of people"
107971,1591602,4,raulmr51,19/09/2021,"Very good area with what is necessary for changing the water and emptying the toilet. In the indoor car park, a very quiet place without noise to spend the night. Thanks to the city of Rota."
107971,1574596,3,mariaaguila,13/09/2021,The area or the parking is no longer paid ... so each one parking his fucking ball ... I wish and the city council had stopped paying to give more option to park the rest of the motorhomes that we love Punta Candor ... .
107971,1535032,4,javyalonso,31/08/2021,"The area is fine and the filling and emptying services are free, this is very positive. The parking is 5 euros and because of the location it is not bad, but the Rota City Council only thinks of putting a festival right next to it ... The filling tap is not threaded, so it makes it difficult to load water if you do not have an adapter for smooth taps, like those in park fountains."
107971,1525419,5,montbli,28/08/2021,"Good area on the beach, good initiative of the city council, other municipalities should take an example."

107971,1499125,2,baikal,22/08/2021,"The area is fine, but the drain is poorly leveled and the gray water does not fall into the sump. This weekend has coincided with a very unpleasant traffic jam. It is commendable that the Rota city council has put this area of AC, but it needs a reform and periodic maintenance."
107971,1489759,1,amsguerrero,21/08/2021,"A shame, I see that people thank the city council for putting this area, but putting a concert venue next to it is a real scoundrel, they announce that the concert ends at 00:00 but then they continue with Dj until 02:00 and then the young people of the bottle. In addition, a bad smell in the water area, because it seems that the pit is full and there is no one who can stand the smell. A real shame"
107971,1475501,4,PiloteQuique,18/08/2021,"Thank you Rota city council for this good area and your services. Ideal to spend a few days, with all services."

107971,1419378,5,ramsesyana,07/08/2021,"A great place to stay, spend three nights there since it is the maximum allowed then I had to go to the street of Alado and also great I will return to places like that"
107971,1408347,1,javiernicolas,05/08/2021,"The situation is very good, a few meters from the beach. It is a dead-end street where cars enter and leave as they please, they come to fill jugs of water as if there were no end. The people literally camped out, with the awnings and chairs, as if it were their farmhouse, not even hiding, a pitiful image. There should be more control."
107971,1401332,3,aetzvan,03/08/2021,"The area is fine, there is a card that is how the panorama goes by releasing the gray and has its place 10 meters away, people with an awning outside, without comments, amazing. For the rest it is fine if you are not lucky enough to park inside you can do it outside but without taking anything out."
107971,1385542,4,Azususu,31/07/2021,"A great place 5 € / 24h if it were not for the Music Festival that lasts all summer (every day of the week) and until 2am in the morning they do not evict and still people stay in the vicinity, urinating, Screaming.. . So not counting on being able to sleep until 3am. If it weren't for this, it's a great place to be."
107971,1378050,4,dzone,29/07/2021,"Perfect. The fact that you have to pay € 5 and you cannot stay for more than 72 hours, makes this site more valuable, without some leveraging for months and without leaving room for itinerant visitors."
107971,1326526,4,vaneygeni,15/07/2021,"Near the beach. quiet area to sleep. Be careful on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays when there is a music festival. You have to pay € 5 in the app for 24 hours."

But now the emptying and filling area is very bad and also there are always two or three Ac, always the same as the owners, camped out, with all the elements of camping outside, open side windows, awning taken out taking advantage of the sidewalk, pouring liquids right there. Very bad image."
107971,1288073,5,albinaiamarc,01/07/2021,"tiny but comfortable area! Next to the beach, a quiet beach and not crowded at all. The area has few parking spaces, we arrive in the afternoon and find the last free space, but further on there is a wide street where AC and vans also spend the night. bus a few meters. The sunset from this beach is incredible! free emptying and filling. Rota, you have worked it out!"

Congratulations to the Rota town hall, it is difficult to find areas for filling and emptying water, they have discriminated against us and here you can spend the night without problems, the parking lot is a bit full but there are some more in the area !!! Good beaches and a good area for cycling !!!"

When we went out to change the waters, we put chairs in the parking lot where we were. I believe that in higher seasons it is too much confusion, the parking lot in the back was also full. I didn't spend another night there!"
107971,1184734,5,outremers,03/05/2021,"Free motorhome area with water and drain near the beach. If you are feeling too cramped there is a large parking lot just behind 50 meters away or you will be even closer to the beach. Huge beach overlooking Cadiz. You can listen to the radio station from the American base, it is a bit different from the Spanish stations."
107971,1182659,5,weinsber,01/05/2021,Good area and has for discharge of sewage and water intake very quiet and close to the beach.
107971,1181321,5,lacamp20,28/04/2021,"All service available and free, very welcoming, clean area, on the other hand I would recommend going to the parking lot behind on the beach side, already indicated on the application. nicer, very quiet and few people when we were there, not sure if it's the same on weekends or in high season"
107971,1175119,3,karinchristian,17/04/2021,"Most of the designated spaces are too small for larger motorhomes, and disposal did not work for me either. But there is a large parking lot right next to it, where there were many motorhomes, apparently longer. It is a 50-minute walk to town"
107971,1173214,5,Claire21,13/04/2021,"Super parking with nearby the beach, a pine forest, beautiful cycle paths and the center. There is another car park a little further down towards the beach with more spaces."
107971,1168791,5,vitvalka,06/04/2021,Awesome location. Close to the beach and a chiringuito. Corals in the water. On the parking lot (there are many) is a lot of space and one has a water tap. Walkways and gym spots undre pine trees. Cepsa gas station. Amazon box. Cycling path. Landing army planes. Million of cats living here. Can you ever ask for more? We love it here.
107971,1153174,5,elrocio,18/03/2021,"One of the best places in the region several parking, shade, etc."
107971,1152350,5,elrocio,16/03/2021,Forest mountain bike beach !! the class !!!
107971,1148384,3,Porterricks,07/03/2021,"Place now full in the shutdown at the beginning of March 2021. Womos also park along the street. Some stay for a longer period of time, so that there is no more space afterwards. Due to the narrow installation areas, you cannot set up a table or chair next to the motorhome. All that remains is the bike / sidewalk in front of it. Close to the beach, beach bar, Cepsa gas station."
107971,1114994,5,kieranandalice,13/11/2020,Wouldn’t sleep here but perfect for free services. Thanks to the municipality!
107971,1096546,4,hippitanos,17/10/2020,"Quiet area with discharge of gray water and filled with water, the only thing is that at night there are many noises of little motorcycles going around it seems that they are racing, otherwise everything is very pleasant and there are always people recommended."
107971,1095256,4,LaPortuguesa,16/10/2020,Highly recommended area with a beautiful access to the beach allows drainage of gray and black water and filling the only penalty that there is no light
107971,1094699,2,LaPortuguesa,15/10/2020,"What a pity that with the good area that it is there is no light outlet, profits for the Ayúntamientamiento. Look"
107971,1088479,3,franruiz,10/10/2020,"The area is quite good, it is appreciated that the city council offers this free service, the problem is that many settle here as if this were theirs, today 10/10/20 there are two families with their chairs and tables occupying the entire sidewalk without allow people to pass. When we are not allowed to park we will complain, and all because of a bunch of rude people."
107971,1043572,3,Marypk,12/09/2020,"Area to empty gray and black. The gray grille is quite small and the refill tap does not have an adapter, so you have to fill with a carafe. The area was full, we spent the night just in another area (which is not marked as such) on the back and without problem."
107971,1033353,1,Virgiiiii,07/09/2020,"The only good thing about it is that it is free, but in such cases it is better to pay ..."

107971,995818,4,txirola,23/08/2020,"The area is luxurious, but the Rota city council should limit parking to 48 hours, there are people who are stuck in the area and do not give many other motorhomes the option to enjoy it."
107971,921500,4,Dabyz,02/08/2020,"We emptied water and filled it in late July, it was almost full. To fill water you have to put the hose directly, it has no adapter, and you have to be constantly pressing."
107971,873779,2,cubitas,16/07/2020,Too bad area motorhomes are settled caravans all summer it's impossible to park
107971,863605,3,carlosdsvq,12/07/2020,"The greywater culvert should be wider, since it is difficult to get it right. With this, gray water is scattered outside, which causes bad odors, so it can be unhealthy. For the rest, we must congratulate the city of Rota for offering us this area for € 2 a day. It has its shortcomings, but its benefits are many. In contrast, the local police should control the stay of some of its users, who spend the entire summer without leaving the site. And to top it off, without the appropriate measures of distance between them, so it is not surprising that it is a new focus of contagion of the coronavirus."
107971,859481,3,bikefire,10/07/2020,"Bravo for the Rota City Council offering a place to recharge and empty waters. The site is very limited in places and you must pay € 2 for being parked 24 hours. Access to the beach is perfect, about 300 meters, there is a beach bar next to it. We have also seen many motorhomes parked in other nearby car parks but I cannot confirm that it can be spent overnight."
107971,851795,3,LaRoncadora,06/07/2020,"The area very well. But like the previous comment, some give it an abusive use, it should put a limit of 48 hours as I have seen elsewhere. We could not stay all full and some caravans even with locks. A 10 to Rota and a 0 to unsupportive."
107971,850261,3,dani3lin,05/07/2020,"The area is in a very good place, but until they set a time limit it will be the area of a privileged few. impossible to park in them when they are parked for the same months and months."
107971,845067,4,pitusilla84,02/07/2020,"Good parking, although it is usually quite busy. there is possibility to park outside the area. there are people who spend the whole summer there. has services. It is far from broken (3km), but there is a bike path to go. It is next to the beach"
107971,823141,1,claisius,13/06/2020,"It is an area with a good location but it is impossible to find a free space. There were people who looked like they had been parked for months, not counting a caravan that even had a barbecue on the sidewalk. Good for Rota city and bad for this type of users as well as the authorities that allow it."
107971,779759,5,fungun,13/02/2020,"I think this place is awesome, if you follow the rules, putting chairs out is ok, but barbecue etc. was not tolerated. One is in 5 minutes over the jetties by the sea and can walk km. You can get water and drain in 200m, a good place to relax for a few days. The only downside is the aircraft from the military base who cares."
107971,777128,1,carlossuperfandango,07/02/2020,"Very sad but this place is going down hill fast. Being abused by the people ""full timing""  who think they own it. Water and toilet empty stinks. I was scared to catch a disease. This place was great 5 years ago."
107971,774692,5,Naow56,31/01/2020,"I'm there, and I'm leaving in 3 days. We are at the end of January and place taken by everyone, but if you are lucky to find a place to go! We are between motorhome operators but everyone is geeeeentil ... Drinking water, gray water and toilet cassette OK. Bar at the end of the street, and beach as far as the eye can see. And secret spot for surfing right?"
107971,766520,3,derMartn,09/01/2020,"Small parking lot for Womos.Ver and disposal not in the best condition but it worked. Place was full, put us outside because there was at least more space."

107971,693685,3,fiper68,16/09/2019,Pitch was ok. Water / waste management. Good starting point to walk in the pine forest or to the beach or dunes. There are even nicer SP in the area
107971,667441,3,Naty65,29/08/2019,"I have spent 2 nights, very quiet, I have paid € 2 for the day, there were quite a few empty seats, but it is true that they are usually the same, we have been lucky. Everything is great."
107971,641702,1,oscar_pollo,18/08/2019,"People are inconsiderate or very smart. there will be like a group of 5 motor homes that don't move, two different days and trying to spend the night. They had clotheslines, legs and everything. there with the tables outside occupying half a sidewalk. I think you do not understand that it is an area not a campsite but of course for € 2 a day that is much better forcing the rest of our classmates to look for life."
107971,624476,4,EmilioEsquivel,13/08/2019,"Payment area € 2 per day, with all services, is very close to the beach with showers and beach bar with toilets, the gray water discharge area is in poor condition .. I think the City would have to put some system to control to the unparalleled and unsupported motorhome, the time of stay is double, since there are some that are weeks away, even the month of vacation."
107971,552461,3,ralberto13,14/07/2019,Service area with possibility to flush toilet and water as well as carry water free of charge. The water tap is not threaded and has a timed closing. Dumping of water is poorly managed and accumulates bad odors. The park area is always full because it seems that it was invaded and the two times that I used to discharge waters I got a sermon because they did not want me to do it. That's why I parked in the park next door after taking the ASA.
107971,546193,4,danigg,10/07/2019,Perfect area to spend a couple of days. Just 3 minutes to the beach walking. To put a stick should the town hall of rotated put some control and not allow people to be stationed there continuously. since it is a pity that other people can not know this place to the these more than half of the squares occupied by people encamped there for a long time
107971,518979,3,natalu,17/06/2019,Completely enough for transit and everything for free!

Beach very close and not too busy even for a Sunday, showers on the beach worked, the bar was packed at lunchtime. Quiet spot for an overnight stay with all water facilities. Lots of roadside parking nearby."
107971,486068,3,jeanmar,17/05/2019,"Quiet area not far from the sea. We went to the port by bike (15 minutes) to take the boat or bus to visit Cadiz, very convenient"
107971,449286,1,carlossuperfandango,05/04/2019,Spoiled by people who stay there by the water tap for 4 months in same spot. Never move hanging out washing and camping .Please be sensible and give others a chance. You know who you are.

THERE IS NO NETWORK! There should be wifi, but we never found the one in the campsite, we tried to connect to the one in the restaurant, but it didn't work anyway, so we were without internet for two days. So if you need internet, I don't recommend it"
107986,2622597,5,verroa,24/03/2023,"It’s a great camping surrounded by mountains, very calm and quiet. They also have a restaurant with good food and pool for 1 euro/day (pay in reception). There is only 1 washing machine and 1 dryer (coins). Clean (but old) bathrooms and showers. A very lovely place to stay! they also have some rules with the toilet, but they dont always check if you have a toilet. (Depends on who works there ;-))"
107986,2580757,5,zieglerdani,17/02/2023,"We had no problem with a VW T4 without a chemical toilet. Absolutely fair price for the offer - € 13.50/ night including electricity for 2 people, dog and van. Sanitary facilities simple but clean. We felt very comfortable!"

They do not speak English at all, the ideal is to have a translation application to facilitate discussions."

107986,1735588,4,isac99,17/01/2022,Probably best campsite on Gran Canaria. Hot showers. WiFi only in attached restaurant and it's not good - only works when restaurant is open. Good menu and choice. Only Movistar phone reception so best to buy a SIM card for WiFi if visiting. Can attract a local party crowd on weekends but weekdays is very quiet. Swimming pool currently shut.
107986,1731665,4,fannyfirlefanz,10/01/2022,"Simple gravel place in the canyon, toilets and showers clean, staff friendly and helpful (but only in Spanish). Probably WiFi, but not where we stood .. Unfortunately, water not particularly tasty."

When we arrived they asked us if the camper was homologated (no), he did us a favor because it was 40 degrees. Although due to COVID, the pool goes for shifts and the afternoon shift was full. Many showers. Also there is no shop to buy anything and the bar closes today at 9"
107986,1155852,2,ju1308,22/03/2021,"Frankly icy welcome. The campsite refuses non-approved vans. This is the first time in ten countries that this has happened to us ... Too bad, because the site seems very pretty."

108002,3288376,5,luz190,12/09/2023,Very nice place right by the sea. Joggers and anglers come by during the day. Very quiet at night. Narrow entrance but easily manageable with a van (T5). With a bit of luck you can even get shade from the palm trees.
108002,3218455,5,simon3102,25/08/2023,"Beautiful parking lot. Direct access to the sea. It's very quiet at night. The 2.5 meters are not correct, the only thing that limits the height are a few palm leaves, which only start at around 3 meters but don't bother you if you touch them."
108002,3210206,5,oliviamcled,24/08/2023,"Amazing campsite! We parked up right next to the water under the palm trees. Serene view, awesome atmosphere and incredibly nice locals.

At night you only hear the sound of the waves. People are very polite and friendly. The beach has many stones but you can snorkel. The path that goes to Isla Plana is very pleasant for a walk."
108002,3115725,2,discovan,10/08/2023,The parking lot is very dirty. The floor is fine dust like red cement that stains everything. Horrible how you put the motorhome inside. People urinate around the edges and everything smells like urine. We're going somewhere else...

We were able to park the van on the other side of the promenade and we enjoyed the best space in the place next to the sea. In the morning, people begin to pass along the promenade doing sports and walking dogs from approximately 7 but without problems or complaints. Ideal place to rest."

Be careful not to miss the entrance, it is directly behind the last property on the left-hand side."
108002,2645958,5,backhomelater,07/04/2023,"Lovely place! been there in April (semana santa) and it was super chill.

Just 2 vans more around, very quiet place to sleep, and awesome to just open the backdoor directly to the sea and have your breakfast or read in peace. some locals pass by doing sports or walking their dogs but nothing to worry about.

The ground may be a bit irregular in some places"
108002,2640143,4,Palo12,04/04/2023,Quiet place in front of the sea. We spent one night with no problems together with 4 campers. More or less level. There are garbage cans nearby. Stone beach. There are routes to do by bike. Nearby is the dog beach. Remember: respect the environment
108002,2631143,5,robson20202020,30/03/2023,Quiet free public car park benefit of been in secluded spot away from the crouds. No road noise. Only locals during the day parking here. Very quiet in the night.
108002,2627426,2,Ceej271,27/03/2023,"Very small parking area for the amount of vans using it, also used by locals as residential parking and is unfair to be taken up by campers. Not much flat ground available, room for maybe 4 vans only. We went to the large campervan carpark further round and absolutely loved it. Don't know why you'd choose this spot when you can have a much nicer space 3mins down the road."
108002,2627054,5,baumbeutelschaf,27/03/2023,"Beautiful parking lot, right on the beach promenade, 20m from the sea. No problem in the early season. The specified height control is not correct, there were also higher Womos there. The height at the entrance is limited only by palm trees. Nice beach and even in March the beach bar east of it was open."
108002,2623723,5,JoeBalu1694,25/03/2023,7 meters and 3.30 height not an issue. Anyone who has problems with that should rather think about their driving skills or a more stable Womo
108002,2623643,4,RamonaGierling,25/03/2023,Beautiful beach! Calm environment. Almost missed the entrance.
108002,2582248,1,Juanangarcia,18/02/2023,"We try to pass with our car, and it is not possible either by width or by height since the palm trees prevent it"
108002,2578044,5,cecilesacre,14/02/2023,"Very quiet corner, 2 nights spent, easy access by AC 7m, several travelers, the sea just in front The entrance is a little before the point indicated on maps, just before the fence"
108002,2574700,5,arek60,11/02/2023,a beautiful place next to a passage with palm trees that stretches for a kilometer
108002,2562327,5,xaedalada,28/01/2023,"Lovely spot! Can we a little tricky getting down the almost hidden little track to the spot, but absolutely worth it. Lovely spot surrounded by other campers, sunset was beautiful and we had a lovely walk along the beach this morning too. Would recommend, but head to the shops first as there isn't anything in walking distance for food or water :) enjoy your stay and tidy up after!"
108002,2562265,5,LauraBorra,28/01/2023,First day in our life of using a motorhome! Comfortable place to rest with an incredible sunset and several campers around us. Free and without services. The entrance to the property between two palm trees goes somewhat unnoticed and was somewhat fair for our outlined motorhome.
108002,2542598,5,marifelixova,05/01/2023,Calm and nice spot. We spent 1 night. Beautiful promenade for walks or running.
108002,2518089,4,vlad77,10/12/2022,"Nice place by the sea. There is only small pedestrian pavement between so very quiet. Preferably for people looking some shady places as many palms around. No good for solar panels expecially in winter time.
See is quite wild in this bit so need to walk few min. for swimming."
108002,2503184,5,MaxiSole,22/11/2022,"The icing on the cake after the city tour of Cartagena. Quiet, you only hear the sound of the sea and when you leave everything clean again, the next ones and the few residents are happy too. You can enjoy beautiful sunsets. Thank you for this great pitch. We stayed two nights and would love to come back here."
108002,2491828,5,RaquelDiez,12/11/2022,To access there is a path between two palm trees right next to a chalet. Very nice place by the sea.
108002,2457994,1,Sitanja,23/10/2022,this place has been sold and is now private!!!
108002,2440844,5,remini33830,13/10/2022,"Small car park suitable for vans or small motorhomes, on the edge of the cycle/pedestrian path. We spent a quiet night there, very beautiful sunset. More daytime traffic."
108002,2387276,5,surroundedbydetails,20/09/2022,"Awesome little place! We stayed here for three days and nobody cared. We could take out chairs and table. People walking by but you won’t even notice. Had a bunch of great conversations. We made it here with a 7m long and 3,20m high RV. Not gonna lie it was tight and tricky but with a bit of driving skills it’s doable! No services. Beach just a bunch of cm away haha. Love it!"
108002,2344760,5,natetchris77,06/09/2022,"Beautiful area !!! We spent the night there (a Monday night). Quiet place access to the sea by crossing the path. We unfolded the table to eat without any problem. Just the entrance to the path which is not wide and at 90 degrees to the road. We had a van 2.70m high and 6m long and passed without problem, going slowly. I recommend !"
108002,2063932,1,luciao,12/07/2022,"Access is very complicated for motorhomes. I do not recommend sleeping here. The only nice thing is the view of the beach. We couldn't sleep the whole night because the young locals were partying with loud music and staying in the place. Also, there is an invasion of flies."
108002,1926793,5,hmorillo,29/05/2022,"Excellent site. By the sea, only a short walk separates you from it. The area is very quiet, just a few people walking in the morning. We share the area with a couple of other vans. It does not have any type of services. Access is not particularly complicated."
108002,1846610,5,Nadine112,22/04/2022,"Parking right on the beach. With us it was very windy and with light rain, but still a nice place. Staying the night wasn't a problem for us. Maybe unfavorable in the rain."
108002,1830163,5,gramos,17/04/2022,"For me, perfect place. Even the weekend sleeps well. Further on towards Azhoia, there is a huge parking lot for caravans, where some even camp. It is another option, because this place is quite limited when it comes to parking. It is not very big and throughout the day there are cars… there are bars and a supermarket nearby."
108002,1763369,5,worldvan2020,22/02/2022,"Great place! Just behave, don't litter, etc. We'd love to come back"

108002,1707849,5,betaduc26,10/12/2021,"Dream spot, right by the sea. The sound of the sea is a bit loud? A little tight at the entrance! Spent one night there seems safe. Do not eat in the Vistabella restaurant, underground bad and expensive."
108002,1707832,5,whatshappens,10/12/2021,"Quiet, 2.75m high no problem."
108002,1465735,3,aizkkora,16/08/2021,"The place is good but there was a commotion all night until 6 in the morning of young people drinking in the area, and they park their cars there too and there is always noise."
108002,1416661,3,txalber,07/08/2021,"Quiet area next to the promenade, but in August on a Tuesday a lot of kids passed by. 5 min walk to beach bars and water in the footbaths. Not suitable for AC. you enter between palm trees and it is a dirt car park"
108002,1301144,4,coves82,06/07/2021,"I did not spend the night here, but it seems a quiet place, a few meters away is the promenade and the sea"
108002,1261489,5,Berlingo_Ferre,18/06/2021,"We spent two very quiet nights here, there were mosquitoes but not too many. The police did not come at any time. It is little crowded and 10 meters from the sea. The boardwalk is next door, but walkers don't bother and they are quiet people. Perhaps for high AC it can be a problem due to the height, since to enter there are palm trees that can brush the ceiling."
108002,1214379,4,tamihami,23/05/2021,"Nice spot right on the sea, seen a beautiful sunset. Within walking distance of a sandy beach with a few beach bars. Spent 2 quiet nights. There is also a trash can, no other amenities."
108002,1196175,3,xondi,14/05/2021,"Small and quiet space but far from the center, so it is not as crowded as the rest of the car parks. The beach in this part is made of pebbles and rocks, it is not suitable for bathing. The access road is wide enough for any standard Ac or camper, you just have to be careful with the branches of the palm trees and open wide enough to enter or exit."
108002,1156525,5,martaRM26,24/03/2021,"A super quiet place with incredible views. It is small but about 4 vans fit well, not obscuring the views it has. The terrain is uneven so it would be good to use the levelers although it was not necessary right where we have placed ourselves. Site 10 without a doubt. In low season it was just us and another van."
108002,1153864,5,biancaberger,19/03/2021,Dream spot! Please dispose of your rubbish (including toilet paper !!!) so that it stays beautiful!
108002,1142334,5,HansdieGans,25/02/2021,"Nice and no problems, not even over 3m high."
108002,1136558,5,charly67,11/02/2021,"Perfect parking under the palm trees, close to the sea. Alone for sleeping in the off season."
108002,1080775,4,Alice.pouly,04/10/2020,"October 2020: very calm and peaceful place during the week (Friday evening for me). At the edge of the beach, a very nice little promenade. ATTENTION: I do not recommend for Saturday evening because I was there and young people stayed until 6am, leaving lots of rubbish the next day ... No respect."
108002,1069141,5,GorkaOlmos,25/09/2020,"Small dirt car park, very quiet at the end of the promenade, next to the sea. Narrow entry site, only cars and some vans. I step between two palm trees. Not a noise all night."
108002,1019053,4,JoseMir,01/09/2020,"We sleep without problem in this parking lot, there are a lot of people during the day but at night it empties. They didn't tell us anything, but we got a group of girls who finished the bottle and stayed for an hour in front of the van talking at dawn. Except that, all great"
108002,1004189,3,HooLee,26/08/2020,"Quiet place, next to the sea. But in general the area was very dirty, with 2-legged animal poop. I had a good time with my 2'60m van without touching palm trees."
108002,1004090,5,Krissa33,26/08/2020,"Great place, feet in the water! I spent 3 nights without a problem"
108002,945287,5,Reubennz,09/08/2020,"Our 2.6m camper had 0 issues accessing the area. Palm trees not a concern at all. Don't even think we touched them. Perhaps the council trimmed them? Very, very nice place though - right by the ocean, just us here - very nice."
108002,852586,4,carlinhortuno,06/07/2020,"We have been this weekend 2 vans VWMultivan and Mercedes marco polo and perfect place, we were just us and spectacular sea views, there is the promenade and then the sea, this small beach is made of stone, a small drawback was that at night They passed young people to some place of big bottle but it is only when people pass by then nothing, to enter you have to be attentive, for me in particular a good place"
108002,789469,1,Elitacor,01/03/2020,Negative comment since it is not possible to access this place if the vehicle exceeds 1'80. Not suitable for GV or Motorhomes. Maybe for a VW California or similar ...
108002,781222,5,grom01,16/02/2020,"We stayed 2 nights without problems. Beautiful, romantic place, a lot of things to do. Only 2 campers today."

108002,662530,4,golfstar,27/08/2019,"The driveway under the palm trees is a bit hidden, but is still accessible to all under 2m. Great location and nice and quiet."
108002,417644,5,Puglia,29/12/2018,For the user Miticoarpege: my van is 250cm high and I passed without any problem so I didn’t realize that other people could have problem. I also put some pictures of the entrance so if you have a big car you should check better photos before choosing the location. As you said this app is for all and it works as a community so if you find something it is not right you can also change the description of the place or edit the high limit.
108002,417521,1,miticoarpege,29/12/2018,"Since this App is aimed at all campers, you must also specify that to get to the park you must go under a tunnel of palms no higher than 180 cm in the center."
108002,415646,5,Katze,23/12/2018,Thanks for the nice place. We stood here for almost a week and really enjoyed the nice weather and the place.

108009,426891,1,scully,05/02/2019,Told by the police you can park but you cannot live in your motor home.
108032,3206586,1,Ranchoneta,23/08/2023,Remember that it is a natural park and overnight stays are prohibited.
108032,2953640,5,oplast,12/07/2023,"A quiet and peacuful spot surrounded by nature and near a river - we spent the evening undisturbed and we slept very well. If you drive past the electric plant trough a small alley on its left, you enter a more hidden and quiet area surrounded by trees and including a few convenient parking spots with lots of shade in the morning. :-)"

Against: -Party of young people the two nights until the wee hours of the morning in the house next door. -Party vehicle movements. - On the 2nd night, a neighbor (drug addict) approached asking all the ACs for €5 to park there. We all decided not to pay. There was no problem. We said that the Local Police informed us that it was free."

In broad daylight they entered our motorhome and robbed us (between 2:00 pm and 7:30 pm), we were not inside, but when we arrived, things were mixed. We have filed a complaint and the police have told us that it is a bad area, and that there have been other robberies. They entered us through the sliding window."
108087,877226,3,Loicleco,18/07/2020,Located 30 minutes from the beaches on foot. Quite a bit of noise because the expressway is right next door. Count that from 8 am sleep has become difficult. No service and no prohibitions. It is a good compromise to visit the city and stay there late.

108162,1876896,5,paco650,08/05/2022,Great parking about 500m from the wall surrounding the old village. Not flat but ok to discover Elbas. If you take a dog the only restaurant in the old village that will take it is called Onofre.
108162,1815871,5,Nyksund,11/04/2022,Parking 200 m from Elvas with views of the aqueduct.

108162,1772511,4,carlitronks,03/03/2022,Spectacular views of the aqueduct surrounded by gardens. Quick access to the city center and cafes nearby. We could not spend the night here because we arrived a little late and there was no room left.

108162,1764119,4,BrianC,23/02/2022,"Very well situated for visiting this old fortified city. Parking is very close to the 16th century impressive aqueduct. The city is very worthwhile visiting. The car park has no facilities, but gave four stars for its location. Spent a very quiet night with 4 other motorhomes. Told tourist information, who said no problem parking for the night. Ramps needed for most areas, although some are level"
108162,1636222,4,hnavarro,10/10/2021,"It is not a motorhome area, it is a very practical car park to visit the city. Very quiet night, we felt very safe. Pitches with unevenness. Restaurant ""Acontece"" 800 meters towards the city, expensive but Haute Cuisine. From the parking lot towards SW there is a small restaurant, across the avenue."
108162,1539625,4,nestou,02/09/2021,Very convenient. Near the ramparts and the old town (on foot). A few places flat.

In the morning we got up and went to have breakfast at the Da Paloma patisserie, a 5-minute walk away and totally recommended. In general very pleasant to sleep without noise."
108162,1186644,3,Perdi2xelmundo,06/05/2021,Ideal place next to the aqueduct of Elvas. Good views and five minutes from the historic center. We just made it through the day and ate here pretty much alone. No problem.

108162,482247,4,BayernSchorsch,12/05/2019,"Parking is pretty sloping, not suitable for the night, but perfect for sightseeing. But when we arrived there was a NL motorhome and let his greywater run into the parking lot. Nice contemporaries, the place will probably soon be closed for RVs."

There are sorting bins in the parking lot"

108187,2506872,4,Imasther,27/11/2022,"In addition to having the 40 liters for €1 in the last tap (for non-potable water, the rest of the taps are for treated water for €1/20 litres) you can empty the black water in the outside bathroom of the gas station by asking for the key and the gray ones in the vehicle washing area."
108187,1991116,5,Titpomme,19/06/2022,"Very good service station, two water points and air. Small store for troubleshooting. I recommend."
108187,1879351,5,vanlifersswe,09/05/2022,"Very good place to refill water, high pressure in the hose. To fill the big tank in the van the last tap is the best, but take the ones before for drinking water, that’s what we were told by the locals :)"
108187,1506058,5,MARIARP,24/08/2021,Brilliant! The last tap is the 40L / € 1. Incredible pressure and the sink works great too.
108187,1408049,5,Vanessa64,05/08/2021,Perfect ! It is 1 € for 30 liters of drinking spring water but the pressure being very strong you have to go through jerry cans or large water bottles of 5 or 8 liters to fill your tank afterwards. There is also the car wash as well as the Repsol gas station in the same place.
108187,984538,5,Esther2018,20/08/2020,"Perfect for filling well water, € 1 40 liters. Very busy place. By the way, there is a car wash that is suitable for the motorhome."
108187,853883,5,FrancescMR,07/07/2020,"Taking into account that AUTOCARAVANISTS have practically no places to empty and fill waters on the island, a filling point like this is appreciated. For motorhomes well water for 3 euros, 120 liters. It does not have a nozzle, you must use a flat tap adapter."

108192,1119475,4,Saitiko,05/12/2020,"Very quiet at night, but the adjacent road was busy in the morning. The adjacent path invites you to take a walk. I can personally recommend the tavern across the street. Have a cheap good breakfast."
108199,2746619,3,Azam,13/05/2023,"acceptable place for one night, try not to put the ac very inside in case others block it, read the signs to know when the flea market is, on that day and the day before the flea market there is usually a lot of noise"
108199,2608469,3,guiizmo95,13/03/2023,"Simple car park, beach close by. Bar on the beach and lots of shops around. Perfect for passing, parking and enjoying the beach! Do not sleep there, dirty and noisy."
108199,1802532,3,danylyxander,01/04/2022,"Acceptable parking, in a good area near the main avenue, very very noisy since cars of workers in the area come and go from the first hour and apart from that if it is combined with market days, it can even be difficult to leave with the motorhome, positive part It is free and the downtown area. I recommend the old town to walk and eat."
108199,1739536,3,Wanderingspirit,23/01/2022,"In the adjacent shopping center there is a laundry in the basement. Open 24 hours a day. Washing €5,- and drying also €5,-. Only with coins! Great for parking during the day. At night there are nicer and quieter places nearby. For example in the harbour."

In short: no problem, neither with the washing machine (far right) nor with the dryer (15min 2 euros, temperature hot). However, I had added my own detergent tab. In short: does what it is supposed to do."
108206,2532788,1,0range,29/12/2022,the worst laundromat in spain so far. poor instructions (e.g. fill in detergent vs don't fill in). At the end there was no or hardly any detergent. the dryers take forever to be on medium. conclusion: waste of money and time.
108206,2334864,5,rperazad,03/09/2022,It is very well located next to a supermarket. It has easy parking.
108206,1693397,5,Fuchsiontheroad,19/11/2021,Super clean! Machine changes notes into coins. Laundry runs for 30 minutes. The dryer also runs for 30 minutes and the laundry (10kg) becomes super dry! In terms of price fully in order!

108219,513719,3,Andrezillo,12/06/2019,"We stayed one weekend in June and found it a very good place. It protects very well from the trade wind of the NE.

Right next to the thermal spa (closed on Mondays) or you can walk down the path into the woods and you’ll find free thermal pools alongside the river which are lovely! I think they use the run off from the spa above, really recommend!"
108248,2523535,5,DaviddeTudela,18/12/2022,They are some spaces next to the road and outside the parking lot of the private pools. Better than nothing to spend the night there waiting for morning to arrive to access the parking lot of the pools.
108248,2351054,3,nerenaranjito,08/09/2022,"Uneven. You park next to the road and there is quite a lot of movement of cars until late. Even so, it is good to be able to enjoy the hot springs (the public ones) late and early in the day."

108248,1973001,5,travellivevan,13/06/2022,We spent a very quiet night in the middle of nature. You have to go early or late to have a place to spend the night. It is a few meters from the free hot springs.
108248,1881138,3,Dragonfly_on_the_road,10/05/2022,"The parking lot is big enough and the spa looks great. Hot springs eg free are closed by a gate and a padlock. Unfortunately, we were unable to take advantage of it. We didn't stay overnight."

108248,1692702,3,JesusCa,18/11/2021,There are only containers. Few places and without leveling. It is a good place to sleep since you have a cheap but beautiful spa and natural hot springs next to the river. The smell of these waters is a bit fetid but after a while you get used to it. I highly recommend the evening spa experience. Quiet place from 23:00 to 10:30. The rest of the day many cars
108248,1548316,3,quoob,05/09/2021,Not many flat spots. The  road not very wide and in high season could be very busy. Very quiet at nigh although in my experience on a Saturday night you have parties of people coming to the springs at any time of the night (up to 5.30am) and can get noisy. There’s also a bar and a restaurant in the Pay-to-get in (€5x90min) Thermal facilities.
108248,1357853,4,lapitona,24/07/2021,In the month of July with enough people during the day but to spend the night quietly. on the way before the hot springs there are quite a few sidings for gv jackets or motorhomes. garbage cans at the entrance to the hot springs
108248,1238667,3,mariamgm,06/06/2021,Quiet place to spend the night but uneven
108248,431573,3,RatonCantabria,20/02/2019,"There is space for motorhomes on the side of the road here, but it gets REALLY REALLY busy at the weekend, make sure you'll be able to get out still when there are cars badly parked up both sides of the road and no turning space at the bottom... We slept in the aire in Ribadavia and drove down here at 9am before spa opened to park, getting into the spa when it opened at 10am. Spa is excellent!"
108248,414100,3,bumblebussing,14/12/2018,Parking for the thermal pools.. public and private. The car park for private pools closes with the spa. There are still a few spaces outside you can park on the road. enough space for a motorhome. The car park was very busy even in December. we didn't stay the night. No services
108248,407509,3,romanber,15/11/2018,With the storm of rain and wind I found this place that inspired me more confidence to be a little more sheltered than the one in Ribadavia.
108250,1588099,3,fannyap,18/09/2021,"Ample parking. There is plenty of space for vans and motorhomes. The area where there is a roof is low, only cars fit."
108250,878128,4,alvaromako,18/07/2020,"This is very good for a stop. you can charge light, a luxury. In summer, be careful with the temperatures"

108261,1868387,4,Yasper,03/05/2022,"Caution! First 13% then 20% incline! Definitely not for every vehicle. At sunset the young people came with 10 cars, but they were peaceful and didn't stay long. At 9 o'clock in the morning a pickup from the city came, we were driving there. According to the sign on the church, no sleeping allowed. Great for one night, with a magnificent all-round view!"
108261,1856748,4,denisparkfournight33,27/04/2022,"Very good I recommend, attention access with steep slopes and coast at more than 12%, very calm night, very beautiful panorama and very nice hike, flat and vast place"
108261,1826168,4,Limoneti,16/04/2022,"We spent the night of Maundy Thursday alone, very quiet during the night with very good views and several hiking trails. During the day it is a very crowded place, strong ramps to climb, small garbage at the entrance of the hermitage."
108261,1717383,4,chispita,28/12/2021,Spectacular place to spend the night. At 9 in the morning the Police came and told us that we could not camp but because of sleeping there is no problem.
108261,1664119,5,JuliaFritzenwanker,27/10/2021,"Mega view, great sunrise and sunset to see, star gazing, simply fantastic, the way up is just a little steeper, maybe not every van can manage ;-)"
108261,1418037,4,tinachan,07/08/2021,"Brutal views, both sunrise and sunset. We slept next to an AC, the downside is that many cars went up to watch the sunset, even at night until curfew at 1. There are no services or garbage."
108261,1251918,3,Losagapunis,13/06/2021,"The access is narrow and steep, but nothing insurmountable, our AC is 6 meters and we get there without difficulty, all the way is paved although you have to go with caution .... incredible place but be careful with the bottles, it is close to Alcoceber and they go up to drink in cars at night ..... flat and perfect place to sleep if not outside because at night there is movement of cars"
108261,1206583,2,Bobby79,19/05/2021,"We wanted to go to the parking lot with our 3.7 t. Approx. 2 km beforehand there is an incline with a specified 20%. Not possible for us. It's also very, very difficult to turn."
108261,1127969,5,BarryGrey,04/01/2021,"Absolutely superp place. Stunning view, superquiet, starting point for a couple of great hiking routes. But the road to get here is narrow and very steep. Parking lot is nice&flat."

108261,780063,5,Espana18,14/02/2020,We stood here one night. Very quiet and a fantastic view. Flat paved place. Before we looked at the large parking space nearby and immediately escaped. Totally occupied.
108261,753021,4,footloosetrvler,12/12/2019,"Nice and quiet with an astonishing view all around. Only few people visiting during the week, don't know about the weekend though. The way up here is very steep, sign said 20%. Not good on windy nights."

108261,443938,3,veggielovers4x4,24/03/2019,Great location. Nice and quiet. We did get a nocturnal visit but they remained (this time) quiet. Really an incredibly beautiful view.

108261,420296,4,zorl48,05/01/2019,Exceptional. View and calm assured.
108273,2854369,2,Ranchoneta,14/06/2023,"Tranquility, a single shade and in summer as there is no air you cook, it is true that in the viewpoint there is more area but there is an awful lot of slope, no shade either, good views and in summer the flies and mosquitoes also eat you, it is an area of cattle and for those who don't know cattle flies bite really hard. If you are in the area, fine but nothing to come to a done thing."
108273,2593680,5,HairySpotter88,28/02/2023,"Fantastic view, romantic in the evening until the end of the day, at night you can literally hear the pin drop when there is no wind! Please leave the place clean and undestroyed, the parking lot at the viewpoint (= Mirador) has two small rubbish bins. Thanks."

108273,1569511,5,evasoos,11/09/2021,A wonderful location to spend the night.
108273,1395304,4,Emilio88,02/08/2021,Good place to sleep in the area with good views. It is super quiet. A little further on is a small public parking in battery to visit the viewpoint to the reservoir.

They dry fatally, washing machines don't work, normal prices for how shabby it is. If you go take €0.5 coins because there is no exchange machine and if you don't they will eat €1. It is true that there is nothing closer, as a last resort it is fine, but if you can move, the better..."

108276,2935181,5,Brewer,07/07/2023,"Very good site, helpful friendly staff. Huge pitches if you spend more than 10euro. We paid 38 for super pitch, 3 adults and electricity so close to pool, extremely clean sanitary facilities and a very reasonably priced restaurant/bar that served a cracking fish and chips. Cannot fault it at all and will stop here again. Even had facilities to wash the van which was much needed after a 1000 miles"

108276,2659875,5,AntoniJS,10/04/2023,"We were there during Holy Week and I would like to highlight the following strong points: - Very large, flat plots with water, electricity and drainage. Very wide streets. -Very quiet campsite with clean and wide showers and toilets. -Delimited areas for playing, pétanque, for dogs. Weak points: -Pool a bit small. -The restaurant's hours were not the best, skipped and not followed. -Game room with few games."
108276,2625543,5,Nats06,26/03/2023,"A spacious, quiet, secure campsite. Pleasant employees. Handicapped accessible. Many showers and toilets, very clean, electrical outlet at each sink, lockers with key, benches, trash cans, etc. Laundry with many sinks, tubs for washing clothes by hand, 2 washing machines, 2 dryers. .. closed park for dogs, playground for children, swimming pool, restaurant, etc. The best!"
108276,2622631,5,SilverEagle,24/03/2023,"A very nice campsite, well maintained, very clean sanitary facilities, nice large fenced outdoor area for dogs, where they can run loose. All in all a super campsite. 2 points, which the campsite cannot do anything about, but is the responsibility of the campers. Dogs on a leash, 99% don't. On comfort pitches, empty the chemical toilet into the drain pipe of the waste water tank at the camper."
108276,2548423,5,Jack89ste,10/01/2023,"We thank the campsite. Having arrived late and having only to rest for the night, we stopped to sleep in their internal parking lot. They didn't charge us and let us use the campsite's showers. Very kind. Many campers and fixed houses inside the campsite, it seemed to me a great quiet place. BEWARE Google Maps got us through downtown and it's tight"
108276,2545923,5,brunoalexander,08/01/2023,"For us a top place. Price depending on pitch size and length of stay. We paid €21.90 including electricity for a motorhome, 2 adults and 1 dog. On the larger pitches, fresh water and gray water disposal is in place. Nice town. Nice for walking and cycling. Ideal with a dog."
108276,2543645,4,Manu046,06/01/2023,"Positive: very good starting point for motorcycling. Places very large and wide streets (also suitable for very large vehicles with trailers). Sanitary facilities very clean. Friendly staff. Negative: no wifi at the seats. Restaurant not recommended, mini market and bread service are also not recommended. Conclusion: price-performance fits at 20 euros for the large space."

Recent sanitary facilities and shower as we would like to have in all campsites but obviously not often cleaned. Small bar restaurant on site. €10 in October but the pitches are extremely far from the sanitary facilities and some people urinate along the hedge, which is a shame. Small downside: pack of nearby dogs barking at all hours."
108276,2440706,4,paquiroger,13/10/2022,good campsite. Too bad only one toilet block at the bottom of the campsite and for the whole campsite. Far from the locations of the beginning.
108276,2424798,4,HansEngl,05/10/2022,"The campsite is really spacious. The pitches are really big. Electricity, water and waste disposal all in place. The price varies according to the size of the space, from 10 to 25 euros. You're just off the beaten path, but calm and not crowded. There aren't 5 points, the cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired. We stayed 10 days and it was never cleaned."
108276,2357604,4,kim.bo,10/09/2022,"Good treatment, good plots, wide streets, correct bathrooms, very quiet and well priced. What more could you want? The downside, crossing the town inside, with a caravan you have to be careful with the balconies."

108276,2313800,5,VirginiePe,28/08/2022,Good price for a more than correct location and a very good welcome. And very good location for us who travel by mountain bike. We will surely come back

For 10€ per day with 1 motorhome, regardless of the number of people it's 10€… there are larger pitches but more expensive, without really a big difference. The swimming pool is superb with deckchairs, few people this weekend of August 15th. The restaurant and the nice bar, in short a good stopover as we would like to find more. 17 km from Peñíscola."

There was not a lot of campers there during our visit so had lots of vacant space around our camper van. If you choose the ACSI price pitches you will be quite a distance to the toilets, showers bar and other facilities. Super friendly staff. Town a short walk away. Had a nice meal in the bar restaurant. Would return."

For the middle category, 2Ü, 2P, dog, WoWa: 38€ (March). The cheap category includes another route to the utility/sanitary building. This very well maintained.

108276,1480114,4,jtorra,19/08/2021,"Quiet camping like none! Perfect for Julios and Agostos, the rest of the year closed pool. Huge plots, impeccable, new and clean services, electricity, water and drainage on the plot. Bar they do little but good. Hours from 10am to 4.30pm and 6pm to 11pm. Very cool pool, too bad they don't open the pool on Mondays and close every noon. (open only July and August) Brutal price! We will be back!"
108276,1460758,2,Udiarraga,15/08/2021,"Despite the fantastic situation of the campsite, the excellent customer service and the current and clean facilities, the campsite is not optimized: there is no shade on the pitches, ours in particular the water supply did not work, the schedule of the services is split ... and the ""supermarket"" is very scarce. One day it will be a great campsite, it has a lot of potential"

108276,1438578,3,UdoSPRINGER,11/08/2021,We stayed in the square for one night on the 8th of July. 48 € for a Womo and 2 people and extra large and electricity. We didn't like it. Pitch was quite small and dusty with fine gravel despite being extra large. The way to the parking space is difficult because of the low-hanging branches. We had not found gray and black water disposal. Noisy by train line and no access to the sea. But safe night with air conditioning.

It has changing rooms with showers and toilets and a swimming pool, including water and electricity. the only problem is that it has almost no shade, but it runs through the air and helps pass the heat. There is also a bar 10 minutes ’drive from Alcocebre Beach and a 5-minute walk from Alcalà de Xivert."

Three rates depending on the size of the plots (16, 20 and 24 € with electricity). Bar, toilets, black and gray oil changes on the most expensive platform or on plots). Extremely courteous and attentive welcome. Credit cards accepted. A beautiful place where an evening stopover as well as a long stay can be considered without a second thought. For our part we will come back to it. A practical tip: do not enter the city center as the GPS encourages you, but go around the city to reach the campsite. With my 6m30 van I narrowly passed in the alleys, with a profile or an integral it would have been impossible ..."
108276,784524,5,Latrusqui,22/02/2020,We were at the beginning of years a couple of times and it is a great campsite. They have a great deal with the motorhomes. It is new and the trees need to grow a little but the services are very clean. Perfect! We will repeat!

Our 2 children enjoyed the space to ride around & the park. The bar/restaurant area is currently being finished (should be in a week or so). Staff are very friendly! We will be back again next year.

108276,743996,5,irnbru,16/11/2019,Just to clarify. It’s 5 euros for a standard pitch with no WiFi or elec.  Pitches are quite large and  are adequate for most vans. Choose a bigger pitch then you pay more. We are here 7m van And it’s absolutely fine.  Nothin open at this time other than toilet/ showers and laundry.  At 5 euros it’s amazing value for money.

There is a sign that says it is mandatory to consume 30 euros in gasoline or the supermarket but they don't tell you anything if you don't (we didn't spend). The only drawback is that the faucet is to press and you have to keep giving it all the time.
108287,2909692,5,vacademilka,30/06/2023,There is emptying of gray black water and water supply with good access. Everything as long as a minimum cost of €30 is made both in the cooperative and in the gas station.

108335,2717014,4,MiSchroe,02/05/2023,"Basically a very nice place and quiet. In warm weather, however, due to the large picnic area and playground, people are present with very loud music. This morning until noon school or kindergarten class on site. Today a stage/picnic area was extensively decorated by community workers. Probably a big celebration sometime soon."

In the morning indeed had a visit from 2 friendly white dogs that did not leave. Because our dog can't be with other dogs, we left."
108335,2602122,5,Dutchwheelz,07/03/2023,"One of the most beautiful places we stayed. purple mountain sides from the flowers. beautiful trees. in the morning 2 large white dogs scared the crap out of me when I was getting something from the back of the camper and felt something behind me. I did however buy their love with some cookies & saved my own life ;) . the road is asphalt, a bit narrow. but no problem for my 7m long & high camper."
108335,2588669,5,acinipo-,23/02/2023,"Hi guys, this place is lovely, it's a pity it doesn't have all the basic services, there's a garbage container and a fountain with a small trickle of water and pool tables and fantastic views, the town 500 meters or so away and at night totally without noise. a magical place. I forgot to advise that AC with more than 6 meters is a bit complicated"
108335,2573949,5,Auwilly,10/02/2023,Above is a second vantage point on the cross with a fantastic view and a tap that provides warm water when the sun is shining. No problem getting up here with a 7m mobile home. Absolutely calm. There's also a point for stargazers.

No Camping. We spent a quiet night alone. Just a few barks in the distance. Typical village of the mountains at 500 m, yes, uphill."
108335,2482565,5,LaTitorra,04/11/2022,"We have been two great nights. During the day there are some beautiful trails, very well indicated, you eat very well in the town. Although there is a road nearby, traffic is zero at night and scarce during the day. We have gone in a caravan, previously we called the Town Hall and they told us that without a problem. Our stay was midweek. There is a drinking water source with little pressure"

108335,1817747,3,akiyo,12/04/2022,"The spectacular site, wide area and in the viewpoint there is a water tap. The bad thing is that there is a steep slope to climb, although it goes up quickly. A pity that there was a group of 8 teenagers with their dogs, cars and drinking and smoking and it gave us a hard time and we didn't stay to sleep. We decided to sleep in Aracena."
108335,1798969,5,Mogotronik,28/03/2022,"Good place to sleep and spend the day. More or less flat site, with a picnic area, water and garbage.

Unfortunately not suitable for us to walk the dog longer, since there are no paths for hiking here, only 3 steep paths which are closed by gates after 300-400m. Marked routes on the other side of the village 4-5km."
108335,1660819,4,MaryJu,24/10/2021,Very nice area to spend the night or a day. Picnic table and children's play area. Garbage and drinking water on site. A very beautiful view of a lake. Small easy hikes nearby. The only downside to avoid on weekends is a meeting point for young people from the village with music… not quiet at all on Saturday evening.

We went with a large volume of 6 meters and the crossing with another car we did, but just right. As soon as we arrived we found a herd of goats with a mastiff in the area, later 2 more mastiffs came to visit us, we assume that from the town and as they are usually quite territorial, we sent our van to get into the van but at first they seemed calm."

During the meetings, the children fed donkeys, horses, goats, and pigs, gathered wild asparagus, and we were also able to buy chicken eggs from a local. Nice walks to do."

108360,1772983,4,larasophiedaily,04/03/2022,"Parking under the hotel also suitable for taller cars! The park attendant accompanied us to a parking space and instructed us, as it was very narrow. Despite the paid space, it is still perfect to spend the day in Alicante. It is billed by the minute. Probably less suitable for sleeping, but you can also stay there at night."
108360,1706762,5,charlin04,09/12/2021,"The Meliá hotel car park is great for visiting the city, as it is 100 meters from the esplanade, 50 meters from the beach and 200 meters from the center. 24h. / € 19.95. It does not have water or electricity services. The people in charge of the parking are very friendly, my Atvc measures 7 meters and I parked perfectly."

The spaces are small but we managed to fit a 6.5m long and 2.8 cm high. Those who attend are geniuses, get off and ask them if there is any space before entering that they look for your return. They made us enter through the truck gate. We paid 6 euros x 3 hours."
108360,858036,5,tommaya,09/07/2020,Perfectly located car park in the heart of Alicante. (Height of our cc 2.90) We asked the caretaker if we could park there for a few hours and he kindly opened a large gate a few meters from the main entrance to that we could get in by motorhome. He also showed us where to park. Super nice caretaker and secure parking!

108391,1739107,3,LeBary,22/01/2022,"Nice place to spend the night despite a slope which can be annoying. Our night was windy but our breakfast overflown by 6 eagles was worth it. Picnic tables, small pine forest and to top it off, a swing for two people facing the void allows you to have a good time. Nothing indicates that the water point is not drinkable. The surroundings of the site are dirty however..."

But he has indicated another place to spend the night.

The water works, although as they say there are people who are not motorhomes who make use of it. When we arrived there were 3 motorhomes in the best area, which is stone, we got close but the ground is dirt. We have rested well despite continuous noise throughout the night from some nearby factory."

It is not idyllic but it is spacious and quiet (at least in a COVID context there is no one at all throughout the night) And a little further in the background, there is another asphalt floor space in front of a wooden table and two little trees that makes the place more friendly."
108444,1014048,2,Palayo,30/08/2020,"The facilities very well prepared, but very noisy from the road, and the settlement that exists nearby, monopolize the fountain for motorhomes in the morning to catch water, wash clothes and give water to the donkeys."

Although it has a large esplanade for being a fairground (avoid village parties) and abundant traffic attached to the area We spent only one night and it was a horror since the fairground has a public scale to weigh trucks.

108467,3084560,2,jesbasor7,05/08/2023,"We wanted to spend the night, but we didn't like the atmosphere and we decided to leave without arriving at 12 noon parked. When paying they tell us that it is €14, we say no, that it is €8 (they told us on the phone and on the web) and he tells us that it is a fault of the colleague who is there in the morning, that if we do not pay it , does not open the barrier to leave. Outraged is little, what a deception! I do not recommend it at all."
108467,3046766,3,Anagd,30/07/2023,"The good: it is 5 minutes from the restaurant area, it is level, next to the river, ideal for spending the day in the city, it has a guard at the entrance. The bad, impossible to sleep, nearby discos until 4 in the morning, when the discos close, the party goes to the parking lot where the vehicles are parked and they leave everything full of garbage and urinate, to find another option to sleep"

108467,2663461,3,popemonica,12/04/2023,We have spent two nights here and the truth is that the best thing is the proximity to the town and the catamaran to go to Cádiz. At night too much noise from the road that passes next to the parking lot. If you want to sleep without noise better look for another place.

For the rest it seems expensive since €8 without any type of service is not the most common. Traffic noise from very early."
108467,2605372,4,deserteagle,11/03/2023,Third visit here and perfect for visiting El Puerto and taking the catamaran in to beautiful Cadiz. The downside is you are surrounded by light to medium traffic noise but this abates later in the evening. For clarity the local audible discotheque operates each Friday from midnight to 0400hrs but not sure on Sat/Sun. We will only use in future during the week. Otherwise an excellent base
108467,2595920,3,gerrypfn,02/03/2023,Convenient to visit the fantastic town of Puerto Santa Maria. We stayed here during Carnival so it was noisy but well worth 8 euros to be within walking distance if the celebrations.
108467,2590308,3,rambles,25/02/2023,Great parking area with the walking bridge over to the town. However €8 with no services is a bit steep. Take the ferry to Cadiz or if you have a dog walk the other way to the train station straight to Cadiz. Dog is free. However don’t come at the weekend there is a night club nearby with music blaring out until 4am. Such a shame we had to leave!
108467,2585348,4,Vandiamo,21/02/2023,"Great for large motorhomes, we are 8.7m & don’t get charged any more for taking more than one space. Ideal for train to Cadiz.

They charge 8 euros for 24 hours and if you spend a minute they charge you another 8 euros, on top of the security guard with a ""cool"" attitude.

108467,1797805,1,ermic28,27/03/2022,It's not worth paying €8 to park your CC in this car park. It won't be any safer than on any other. I surprised teenagers hanging around around 9:30 p.m. on my way back from Cadiz. Very noisy with the road and young Spaniards crossing it at night to go party in El Puerto.

Unfortunately the ferry wasn't running at the moment, but there was an alternative bus connection. Which was bad for us because dogs are not allowed on the bus or on the ferry.

Very expensive compared to areas that offer filling or at least emptying. As for being guarded, I think that's saying a lot. We entered late and there was no one controlling. About the gas station, saying that being in the parking lot does not give you access to emptying and filling. You MUST refuel."

108483,2760717,3,JosePellicer,18/05/2023,I tried to spend Saturday night. First came dog walkers. Then at dusk teenagers alone with the car and also couples. In the end I decided to go down to the parallel street below to spend the night.
108483,2715039,4,Camperlife69,01/05/2023,Quiet and calm place. Not the cleanest but fine to spend the night.
108483,2568836,5,Victorpablo,05/02/2023,We have spent two nights and we have rested very well. No vehicle traffic.

108487,2551077,5,waspo,14/01/2023,Perfect spot for the night. Lots of surfers during the day. Otherwise super calm and relaxed.

108489,2630510,3,Ralphdomi,30/03/2023,"We slept there one night. In the morning woke up early by the departure of the trucks but we were parked near the street. At the bottom of the car park, surely quieter. We ate excellent tapas at the bar ""el boliche del nene"" on the main square of the village!!!!! and cheap and very original"
108489,2520849,4,vanlifeFloki,13/12/2022,Just stop to refill our water storage.Bit of walk up and down but relatively quick water flow.

108546,3060124,4,viajeroaustriaco,01/08/2023,"Safe place, in front of the sea. We spent one night there with other campers. WC is closed at night but the shower is active. Young people were a bit noisy at night and the church bell woke us up in the morning."

108546,1679786,5,JackRees,06/11/2021,Beachside location with toilet and shower facilities after 9am. Cheap cafes and bars closeby but no supermarket that we saw. Amazing ocean views and plenty of room - if a little windy. We spent 3 nights there. Great little spot.
108546,1335762,3,RiccardoAlborghetti,18/07/2021,The place is very nice and touristy. 3 stars because the entrance is an uphill bend with two sidewalks. I arrived on Saturday and there were cars everywhere ... I was struggling to pass and I had to leave. we went elsewhere
108546,1210782,5,appavan,22/05/2021,The pin for this spot should actually be a bit further south: there is an area south of the showers which is a bit elevated and has lots of space and an amazing view!! We spent an amazing day and night here :)
108546,1066780,5,Pinocchio070720,23/09/2020,Perfect place to park up right behind the beach and have free private (and warm!) shower inside the blue building at the north end of the large parking... :)
108546,1031774,4,Lopeth,07/09/2020,"Right where the beach begins, the entrance is about 150m ahead of where the coordinates are marked, indicated by a P for parking, a lot of space. In high season you will have to arrive early in the morning or late at night to take a seat. Silent night and with the noise of the waves. At the beginning of the car park there are public outdoor toilets and showers, very clean and well-kept."
108546,1030118,5,RuiVal,06/09/2020,Very good space. In summer it gets more complicated due to car parking. Bathroom available only in the summer period.

Very quiet, close to the beach and directly garbage, toilet and outdoor showers at the parking lot. No shadow."
108546,932791,1,lifeaswevan,05/08/2020,Tried to park here but couldn’t find a single space available. We got there at about 6pm and it was one of the most crowded places we’ve been to. Terrible traffic around the beach area and no place to park a car so definitely no place for a van. (It was a sunday though so i guess it must be emptier doing the week and later at night)
108546,779646,4,carregal,13/02/2020,In February we spent a very quiet night. The town in this empty time and many closed premises.

Access to the solar toilets and hot showers clean, with pressure and very spacious, in the turquoise blue and white building at the far left of the promenade looking at the sea. Very good sandwiches at the booth fries just in front!"
108546,541438,5,Turnschuh,06/07/2019,A great spot. There are two cottages on the promenade where there are hot water showers and toilets. The parking lot is very empty and quiet in the evening. The people in the place very friendly and the beach totally clean.

Retuned to vehicle to contact Police for report and insurance company. There is a rough area nearby which isn’t apparent at the metro car park.
108549,2418886,5,lilou67,02/10/2022,"We stayed there all day, the metro is right next door (Condequinto station) to go downtown (Puerta Jerez station). Very practical, I recommend"

108549,1640876,5,Antoniopurchil,12/10/2021,"Perfect for what it is: you park and take the metro to the center, it is an area, it is a free parking during the hours that the metro works."

108554,1567362,3,martaoscar,11/09/2021,"Apparently quiet next to a garden and the skatepark, in front of the cemetery. Many people walk and ride a scooter. As it was Friday night, cars with music passed by and we had to sleep with the window closed. You can sleep, but without more than the site."
108554,654727,3,capichana,23/08/2019,"This quiet location in the shade has done us a good service. Nevertheless, and it could have happened anywhere, an individual tried to open the tailgate blocked by the entrebâilleur ... very big fear at 6 o'clock in the morning!"
108554,468056,3,ralberto13,26/04/2019,Basic park to stay one night. We stayed on night after returning from Marroco. No services and a little noisy but acceptable.

108585,3273655,5,NuriaDF,08/09/2023,"AC parking right next to the Camping. The reception is the same. A highly recommended place to spend one or more nights. The town is 1.7 km away and you can walk there, although on the way back, as we were tired, we took a taxi from the center of Ronda which cost us 10 euros. Impeccable cleanliness and a lot of tranquility (only 1 more camper)."

There is the area or campsite on offer, the area is very good, impeccable sanitary facilities, hot showers, everything is impeccable. 18€ cc 2 pax 1€ for the dog"
108585,3234539,5,MatteoPantini,29/08/2023,"We only spent one night, we were the only ones present in the campsite and we had a very good time. Very honest in suggesting this place to us at €19.00 for 3 and not the adjacent campsite with swimming pool since it was already 8.00 pm. Very clean bathrooms."
108585,3169105,5,Amick,17/08/2023,Great campsite. Extremely clean and maintained. The welcome is great and the staff who speak good French are very friendly. The pool is quiet. Good value for money

We were turned away before dinner after wanting to play a card game. Incomprehensible if you run a bar/restaurant on a campsite.

Good pitch (plenty of space), excellent pool area (more like a hotel) and various playground and other activities (that we did not use). The on site restaurant is a proper restaurant with good food (best octopus dish I have had anywhere). Less than 20 minute walk into the historic part of Ronda on a quiet road. Ronda is a must visit - we had seen photos but it was so much more than we were anticipating."
108585,2909015,1,capitangelato,30/06/2023,"Closed for maintenance (June 30, 2023). The camping aside is 30 euros, 2 people/1 small van."

108585,2816545,3,Fam.SchmiFa,03/06/2023,"Pitch functional with small flaws as described. Infants have to pay as an extra person, although there is nothing for them. When asked if they were allowed to use the playground on the associated CP, this was denied. Since the parking space is adjacent to the playground, you had the noise all day. The way to Ronda, easy to find, but currently about 1km only possible on the road."
108585,2788818,4,Tamlac,26/05/2023,"A big thank you for the welcome, kindness and above all very good advice in French. A very functional area, small flat for intermittent hot water for the shower and cold water for the dishes. Very weak WiFi. Restaurant next door, very good but the 2 rolls offered on the table are charged 1.50 each, consumed or not."
108585,2788756,4,chtsering,26/05/2023,"We received a warm, really lovely welcome from Carmen. Small flat for the air, the water in the shower was hot intermittently and there is no hot water for the dishes. Very good location for visiting the beautiful Ronda, 1.3km easily doable on foot. We thank Carmen again for her exceptional welcome."

108585,2704227,4,mherrm,28/04/2023,Good starting point to visit Ronda on foot. 1 toilet/shower per gender a little tight but sufficient.
108585,2700046,4,Bilou36,27/04/2023,We were on the camper space next to the campsite. Great location with a multilingual and charming person at the reception. The only downside is that there is only a functional shower and no hot water for washing dishes. E-bike needed to get into town. Excellent stay.
108585,2690151,5,Saskia0812,23/04/2023,"Small, top located parking space right next to the associated campsite. Showers/toilet/washing machine available. Two V/E places. Registration next door at the reception of the associated campsite."

108585,2681387,5,bast40landes,19/04/2023,we had a good night without noise in peace! everything is clean wc shower! at the reception Carmen speaks fluent French and she is adorable and gives good advice
108585,2679703,4,LudoBea,18/04/2023,"Area forming part of the campsite. Very nice home. Recent toilet blocks, very warm shower water (too bad), no toilet paper. Many sloping places requiring chocks. Very quiet night. 2 very functional service areas. Restaurant at the campsite 50 meters away. 18 euros in this season (van+2 people)."
108585,2677979,3,Wokiss,17/04/2023,"Only option to walk Ronda, leave the van on a secure hand.  Poor wifi, Toilet&showers need updating."
108585,2664043,2,Kvanto,12/04/2023,"Surprisingly, all places in the campsite are with a slight slope. All cars are forced to level off. For the first time I met a toilet without toilet paper and a bathroom without soap. They are not provided. Even the public toilets along the highways have it. Strange greed of camping owners."
108585,2662994,5,Nelyan,11/04/2023,"Very nice area. Registration is done at the reception of the El Sur campsite. Sanitary included in the price: wc, shower, washbasin, sink. Paid service: washing machine and dryer. Grocery and restaurant at the campsite. Everything is on top. Rare to find such a functional area. Ronda at 1km300 to do on foot or by bike from the area. Friendly and helpful staff. THANKS !"
108585,2655361,5,louisoudiane,09/04/2023,"CC area belonging to the adjacent campsite. We paid 20 euros for the pitch, 2 people and water electricity and gray and black water services. Quiet despite the number of people. 15 min walk from Ronda. Very clean. Perfect !"
108585,2653352,4,stef30129,09/04/2023,"Pleasant area even if a little cleaning (butts) of the location would not have been too much. Clean toilets. Mixed reception on the friendliness. As much as we were very well received, as much, for the departure we came across a French girl who was not pleasant at all, too bad. Very clean filling and emptying area"
108585,2639674,3,JoaoBravo,04/04/2023,"The area is good but the toilets were very bad. Great and super friendly reception. They urgently need to improve the toilets. Some noise because it's next to the road. Very close to Ronda, where you can walk."

108585,2618842,4,camper_stan,21/03/2023,"A little bit expensive, has a decent laundry and enough showers for everyone."
108585,2613165,2,BoxerPetite,17/03/2023,"Our first guess on P4N was that it should be a good camper place. At check-in she wanted to book us right into the campsite for 24 euros per night. We said that we would like to spend the night at the camper place for 17 euros. Unfortunately, we found out too late that with more than 30 campers you have to use 2 showers and that there is no hot water for washing up."
108585,2611157,3,Sandraenton,16/03/2023,"Perfect place but no charm at all. All campers are parked as in on a parking lot. 1 shower of the two was working, dish washing with cold water only. It is good for secured parking with electricity so we were happy because it suited our purpose, on the campsite there is a restaurant and a really small store. Super friendly crew, receptionist speaks several languages."
108585,2608420,5,gemahn,13/03/2023,We were very satisfied. Friendly service. Well organized. The price performance ratio is very good. Ronda and surroundings just beautiful.
108585,2605136,5,jdf500,10/03/2023,"Great park up attached to the campsite, friendly receptionist, speaks several languages and is very knowledgeable about the area. There are now two motorhome service areas within the park up for filling with fresh water and emptying of grey and black water. The old town of Ronda is about a mile walk from the park up, the Bull Ring is fantastic as is the Puerto Nuevo, would definitely stay again."
108585,2600606,5,chantaldante,06/03/2023,"Area on small gravel with all services, toilets, electricity and wifi for 15€ per night. A bit far from the city center, have good shoes.

108585,2597134,2,WLMHoogendoorn,03/03/2023,"Fairly short pitches, but half of the camper place was open. Now the 21 places were completely full. There was only 1 shower available with a very bad faucet. The shower building is open, so very unpleasant in colder weather. Only cold water for washing up. No hand soap or toilet paper available. Check-out must be before 12 noon. We didn't think it was really value for money. Night was fairly quiet."
108585,2587152,4,nandjgocamping,22/02/2023,A very good motorhome parking area run by the campsite. 2 toilets and 2 showers for the 20 pitches. Hot shower but only cold water in sinks.  All very clean and tidy. Very secure. Only 1.5km walk into Ronda. Sone good road cycling from here too. €15 for a van and 2 people including electricity seems fair value.
108585,2585445,4,overmack,21/02/2023,"Good area, all services, it is a campsite but it has an attached motorhome area, very quiet and well leveled."
108585,2581139,4,gilles1310,17/02/2023,"Area very good, only downside the places are short, 7m max, and narrow. Owner very friendly and speaking French. We spent just one night."
108585,2577739,5,PaVie,14/02/2023,"Very friendly welcome and in French, very well maintained campsite with beautiful pitches 1.5 km from Ronda.

108585,2558523,3,Vanderlife2022,23/01/2023,Good location for visiting Ronda. Clean sanitary facilities but very mediocre shower. Very annoying especially in cold weather.
108585,2527296,3,Janenagnes,24/12/2022,Great place. Everything is there for the camper. Idd no hot water to wash up. Beautiful area.
108585,2520879,1,LenaHedlund,13/12/2022,"This place is not something I would recommend. No WIFI as promised, no toilet paper, when we pointed it out they said we would have to pay for it, but no information about this before. No front door to the shower/toilet, so freezing cold to shower, weak hot water. Unfriendly staff. Continue past. The same owner as the campsite, so they want you to set up there in the low season, but more expensive. Lena."
108585,2516936,2,Azanobini,09/12/2022,"the place is not bad and is certainly preferable to the campsite next door which offers the same things. only that: - constant noise from the street next door for algesiras which only stops at night - the promised wifi doesn't work - there were three of us, empty area, I asked to postpone the checkout by ONE HOUR, 1 pm instead of 12, and the lady at reception REFUSED. zero flexibility and focus"
108585,2507742,4,cycleretreats73,28/11/2022,Was a good spot and very friendly on reception. The spaces are quite close together and you can’t sit in front of camper. The wifi doesn’t work but everything else is spot on.
108585,2484514,5,Kickn,06/11/2022,Super pitch to visit Ronda. We have a 7.9m camper and it also fits perfectly. Only some pitches are very small. It's very quiet here and we stayed 3 nights. The showers are also okay and hot water is also there. ? Can therefore highly recommend the place.
108585,2470996,5,CamperMaster13,30/10/2022,"Very good place to continue with the route, quiet environment, almost level squares, curious toilets and showers, area for emptying and filling water... 10 minutes from Ronda and 25 from Juzcar (the Smurf town). Thanks for everything."
108585,2469936,5,molskyy,29/10/2022,"We spent one night, it was quiet and safe. Bathroom was clean, the place was well maintained. The price of 15€ is more than fair in my opinion. You need to go to the reception of Camping el Sur and say you want to stay here - it’s the same reception desk. I recommend!"
108585,2468884,4,ccnous,29/10/2022,"Very good value for money. Very well placed to visit Ronda (6 kms) for us by motorbike.

108585,2393865,5,danfjr1300,22/09/2022,4/29/22. Despite 7.80m and a few maneuvers parked in the Ccar zone. Too big for camping. Secure parking Little space but partly shaded. Restaurant next door is awesome. 20 min walk downhill from an entrance to the Historic District; more to go up!!

108585,1872645,1,GJW,06/05/2022,"Camper place very small you can not sit in front of your camper! The wifi does not work! When we asked for it, she responded very laconic, no, it doesn't work at the camper place (neither does it at the reception) we said they advertise it so that we expect wifi, after all, we pay 18 euros. Yes but wifi is free so if it doesn't work then so be it you don't pay for it. We have left."
108585,1868008,4,domiabdel,03/05/2022,"good morning. Small clarification, the campsite does not take the acsi card, but offers a 5% discount on a price of 28.50 for a cc of 7.50m and 2 people. As for the CC area depending on the campsite, the manager told me that we were too long and that we would not go in. So, we are on the CC area in Ronda and there are no problems."

It has bathrooms but the hot water in the showers is only given from 7 to 10 and from 19:00 to 22:00. The sinks do not have hot water and the bathrooms are open so if you are taking a shower and it is cold outside in the showers or bathrooms too. It is a 2.7-minute walk from the bullring, about 37 minutes on foot, and you have to go down a road that has no hard shoulders."
108585,1836950,4,geraallday,19/04/2022,Nice pitch. There weren't many other campers when we were there so we had plenty of space. Ronda can be reached on foot in 15 minutes.

I recommend."

Not coming back for sure!"

108585,1217136,4,SebastianChristoph,25/05/2021,Easy check-in and everything is very well maintained. Eliminates stressful searching for a parking space in the city. Negative for us: - no warm shower for 12 euros (costs extra) - from about 10 p.m. continuous frog concert (because there is a small pond next door) - definitely remember to wear your earplugs!

There are other magnificent places near the center and the beach that are very accessible, wide and flat to stop and spend the night perfectly with your camper or motorhome, so this place is not worth it."

108626,1319412,4,ManuelLopezGarcia,13/07/2021,Not recommended for motorhomes of more than 6m and wide if for camper type or van through narrow streets and the parking space that is for cars of various lengths relatively quiet place but very used so it is difficult to park in the afternoon passing of people towards the Church and restaurants
108626,1305147,4,gloriamgp,08/07/2021,"We have spent one night and very quiet. next to the train station. going down to the right there is a tap with water. and a little later the containers. 5 minutes from the upper part of Altea, which is worth visiting, beautiful. also very close to the beach."
108626,1265190,1,carsanlo,19/06/2021,"Lousy. A parking lot on several floors with slopes, sharp curves, full of cars in summer and impossible to park a Motorhome."
108626,1201176,4,jorgefurgocamper,16/05/2021,"A simple but very quiet car park, close to everything, 5 minutes walk from the beach and another 5-7 minutes from the old town. 4/5"

108626,774232,4,Rubydooby,30/01/2020,Not many free overnight options in this town centre but this is conveniently close to walk to old town and promenade. Great for a one night stop but felt a bit guilty as locals are in and out in the morning although we had no problems. Useful Public Water tap to fill containers is 60 Mtrs to the left of the lower exit. Not recommended for motorhomes much over 6mtrs long though.
108626,597389,3,Datoga,04/08/2019,"Parking with several levels and enough room but several steep slopes. Near the old town and the promenade, near viewpoints with beautiful views. In general a good place to park."
108626,454772,3,Valencia1326,14/04/2019,"Site for motorhomes not very big. With mine of 7 meters I had to do a lot of maneuvering somewhere, and I skimmed branches and hedges. 5 minutes walk from the seafront and 10/15 minutes from the old part."

108627,3222819,3,GillCampos,26/08/2023,"We do not stay overnight, we only use it for services. Water faucet without thread/clamp makes it more challenging for those with thicker faucets."
108627,3196974,3,SemprAbrir,22/08/2023,"Service area very close to the IP2 with great ease of access allows you to empty, but supplying water already requires some adventures... in our case we were always firmly holding the insertion of the hose into the tap, as it is a threadless tap!"
108627,3193725,2,MileneDinis,21/08/2023,"service area was only used for evictions, without access to supplying drinking water as the existing faucet is not threaded, nor accessible to any normal hose."
108627,2843169,4,Reiziger14,11/06/2023,"Conveniently located parking, supermarket and laundry nearby, the village and castle within walking distance. The services work well. A disadvantage is the dogs that occasionally bark very loudly and for a long time. I don't know how the locals keep it up. At night the car park is illuminated by street lamps."

The castle and free info centre tops a very nice tranquil village"
108627,2611657,1,ingin69,16/03/2023,"Could have been good, however, someone decided to park a truck and trailer across four spaces (see photo) ruining it for others. Selfish behaviour such as this should not be tolerated."

108627,2525780,5,fan4womo,21/12/2022,"Everything is very nice here! Lots of space at the moment! I can't understand why it can get tight here with my 8 meter motorhome. The sat nav only shows the exit to the right too early! You then have to take the next street on the right and then right again into the dead end. Signage is from one side only. Really quiet and good, in the middle of the village, gas station diagonally opposite."
108627,2503800,1,OzeanienArt-on-Tour,23/11/2022,"I drove past the other day, actually wanted to spend a night. On the side of the garbage can, one car stuck behind the other, the WoMo place was also quite full and I have a 9m WoMo with a large turning circle. Of course I would have somehow managed to squeeze myself in there, but I probably got claustrophobic afterwards... Very (!) narrow there."

108641,2669784,5,waynesmith,14/04/2023,"What a great campsite, new toilet block near the front of the campsite, the others are in need of refurbishment (I’m sure this will come in time) indoor and outdoor swimming pools. Specific dog toilet areas. Nice walk to the beach where you will find lots of bars and restaurants, you must visit The One Bar for a good and cheap night out."
108641,2551655,5,GabiBadura,14/01/2023,"Super place!Lots of permanently occupied places with lovely gardens. Large plots, even for motorhomes up to 10 .Nice staff at the reception - very helpful. There is a mini supermarket and restaurant on the campsite. The pool is open all year round. Dog run, dogs very welcome. Most of the guests are very nice English, the atmosphere is very nice. We are very pleased, we will definitely come back."

We have paid €35 for one night, a bit excessive to be honest. The campsite is a 40-minute walk from the center."
108641,2494103,5,Drownedrat,13/11/2022,"Very well run site, clean and tidy with liberal hot water in the showers, indoor pool ( outdoor pool closed for season) and good on site shop. We paid €25  a night and electricity worked out just under €2 per night ( pay deposit and bill settled on departure). We walked everywhere so it was a bit too far away from the old town for us but if you use the bus or bike it would be perfect."
108641,2427761,4,Mr.Ti,06/10/2022,"Great facility. Water, electricity and gray water directly on the plot. Pitches are relatively large. Clean facility. Many permanent campers. It's about a 20 minute walk to Benidorm. Perfect for a city tour. Point deduction for the old, broken playground. Swimming pool definitely too small for such a large area. Front desk staff were super friendly and helpful."

108641,1173581,1,TripsWithMyWife,14/04/2021,They charge 2€ per dog ridiculous!
108641,1129370,2,737italy,09/01/2021,"I give 2 stars because of the very high price and the services offered. I stayed on 7/8 January 2021, alone and with a van of mt. 5.40, Euro 25.00 per day, (I don't know how much the month of July and August can cost). WiFi is slow and paid (not included in the price). As already reported by another user, the price of electricity is too high (they ask you for a daily deposit that you will surely risk losing). As for the cleanliness, nothing to say, the campsite is very well kept and very clean. I could not take a shower because the room was heated, but the windows were kept strictly open, a person who is not used to such harsh climates risks pneumonia in these cold months, I mentioned at the reception, but it hasn't changed nothing. Since there are other equally large campsites nearby, I recommend that you do an inspection to see if they are cheaper."

Very clean showers and facilities. Convenience store on site and several shops nearby. The pitches are well demarcated and with enough space, individual water on the other hand electricity is very expensive. We still had a beautiful and comfortable stay."
108641,754601,3,jenka,17/12/2019,"In a good location ideal for Benidorm, unfortunately it's looking a little tired and full of long termers. The electricity is expensive as is the daily rate."

108658,439762,3,nicolabushell,14/03/2019,Great for a quick stop as it has picnic benches. The water tap has no thread though so good for filling up bottles rather than an inbuilt water tank.
108686,1374236,3,SimoneChufster,28/07/2021,A cute village but access is limited to those in large campers or motor homes. Friendly place and worth a visit to see a part of the Sierra de las Nieves National Park.
108686,450756,1,colindove,08/04/2019,This is definitely not a place for motorhomes. Car park is full of cars most of the time and access is  virtually impossible for any vehicle over five metres. Would not recommend.

108697,755112,2,Ekaterina,19/12/2019,"It is possible to spend the night here before taking the ferry to Morocco, but it was very loud! In the evening, the parking lot was filled with restaurant visitors. At 12 noon the police knocked, we were allowed to stop but only once, so to speak, the next morning we went to the ferry anyway. Around 7 am, garbage collection, cleaning vehicles of all kinds were in use. Overall too stressful and noisy, but nice view."

We did not get to spend the night, but we left it for two days (from 12:00 to 23:00) and in addition to being quieter than the area of the park that is a few meters away, you have more shady areas on one side of the road . And near the center."
108705,655841,3,Mayi6857,24/08/2019,"It is not bad to spend a night, taking a walk you are in the center, little step of vehicles, towards the afternoon shade in area of trees."

We did the Pulo do Lobo Waterfall route and we have to say that it is INFUMABLE. Nothing recommended. Go down to the waterfall and go up where you came down. Or at least in summer it is not recommended.
108742,2848064,5,Nando51,12/06/2023,"I spent a perfect day and night, I went to visit Pulo do Lobo and did the trail along the river, which takes two hours to walk and offers fantastic views."

You can drive down to the waterfall but we figured out that this spot has a way better view. And who doesn’t want to wake up next to the sheep? :D If you walk down the waterfall, there is a rubbish bin half way or in the village that you pass when you drive to this spot."

We could easily manage road and park a lonely night directly at the cascades with a 7m truck. Bit narrow to turn down there. During sunday afternoon many visitors came and went after some selfies. No mobile net!"

Tip stop at the first car park with a trash can right after the gate before the white warning sign. It's a real ? If not 4x4 and or raised. I was up to the old fountain and I turned around with a 6 m Fiat Ducato Possl vehicle after that it was impossible to the bottom. It was funny but it was hot?"

108744,518513,4,carlosll,17/06/2019,"Very good to sleep, it feels safe and calm. We were on Saturday, in the afternoon children with motorcycles, something annoying, and then other young people doing spinning with a car, but the typical thing that happens in each town."
108744,451341,5,Mari1,09/04/2019,"Very nice place! It is a kind of recreational facility, generously laid out with several barbecue areas. We stood there for 2 days and it did not bother anyone."
108744,428110,3,nelipq,10/02/2019,"Quiet place, far from the town, we sleep without problem. Prque with slide for children, picnic area and barbecue"
108749,3189489,3,ZambiVan,20/08/2023,"Thank you to the municipality for this service. Personally, I think it's good for filling up with water and evacuations."
108749,3152932,2,Virgile03,15/08/2023,"We can just drain gray water and refill it with water Full WC part and disgusting, some we empty their cassette in the middle of them gray Really people without any respect.!"
108749,3102356,3,anaQ35,08/08/2023,Has the merit of existing and being free in the sector. clogged toilet but the rest works. Provide adapter for water.
108749,3085912,1,NOAH14,06/08/2023,"The sewage drain is clogged and overflows! You can park but if you happen to be near the drain, better find another place because it's disgusting."
108749,3083209,4,Attila077,05/08/2023,"It's not the best to have a sloping unloading area, but if you take the measures well, it won't be a ""big job""! :-D There is everything ... but you have to search well ;-)"
108749,3078406,5,SergioConnor,05/08/2023,"It's perfect for me, a clean paved place with trees on the other side where you can walk the dog. Near everything"
108749,2909144,4,monipedes,30/06/2023,"It is a truck parking without services. Even so, it is close to the town and, for one night, it is fine."
108749,2862036,4,volvox12,17/06/2023,"Good place to spend a night, with the basics to be comfortable. The only negative aspect is that it is at the foot of the road and there is some noise. It is located about 15-20 minutes from the port."
108749,2820643,4,Mendexxx,04/06/2023,"The area itself is ok, the road passes right by, but there wasn't much traffic at this time either. The dumping area smelled very bad, probably because the black dumping area was clogged and the water was overflowing. It has some slope. The port is an 8-minute walk away."
108749,2778452,4,BezzaG,23/05/2023,A slight slope but nothing that bothered us. Had a quiet night here. Services all clean and working OK. Kudos to whoever engineered the Heath Robinson fix for lifting/holding up the manhole cover and then applying pressure to the push button tap! Potable water flow a bit slow but the fix makes it slightly less tedious!
108749,2699980,3,Berbel01,27/04/2023,Perfectly ok for one night. It's just really loud.
108749,2698028,3,Phil10kn,26/04/2023,Thank you to the municipality for making this service area available free of charge
108749,2678598,3,Sin.deentrega,18/04/2023,Loading of water and discharge of grays well. Sewage backed up but there's a small culvert right next to it that can be lifted up and used while it's being fixed. inclined. Thank you very much to the town hall
108749,2677343,1,hedwigr,17/04/2023,Discharge toilet not possible due to blockage
108749,2666976,3,stef30129,13/04/2023,Not very welcoming but all services are there for free (apart from electricity). very practical
108749,2653421,4,Kram907,09/04/2023,"Asphalted area, quite inclined and with all services (except electricity)."
108749,2649225,4,supertrump,08/04/2023,Area with services but too small and inclined. a motorhome has broken its automatic step because of the high sidewalk at the entrance. sometimes those who do these areas do not have a motorhome
108749,2638194,4,angoitia,03/04/2023,very quiet area with all services. 10 mim walk to the port. town worth seeing. attached to soccer fields. It is very inclined
108749,2637866,1,LorAi,03/04/2023,"Sloping site next to the road, and the gray water emptying area full of feces... Very dirty people... Thanks to the town hall for this area, but there is a sign that says that you cannot wear leggings, and without them it is impossible to sleep... It is not very coherent..."
108749,2635293,3,alien62,02/04/2023,"apart from the cleaning which is the fault of the users, the square is downhill and there is a high step to climb the drain"
108749,2619289,1,reneboul,22/03/2023,"one star, not against the installation because I thank the municipality for this free area, but zero stars for the motorhome(s) who dump the cassette next to the drain, okay it is clogged but you just have to think about it ( if they have the brains for it) and with a screwdriver we open the manhole cover right next to it and we empty the poop. Thank you for respecting the places."
108749,2605092,2,annickpelorjas,10/03/2023,"Noisy parking lot, mopeds spinning in the parking lot"
108749,2603304,2,karyon,09/03/2023,"It's a lot of downhill. Ordinary parking lot. I didn't feel good there alone, I went to sleep elsewhere."
108749,2594772,4,amilcareilcamper,01/03/2023,Free loading and unloading area with parking (allowed max 72h). Drinking water.
108749,2592846,3,ViennacatsAT,27/02/2023,"We stayed one night. V/E is OK. The slope is just about the same, but better with wedges. From 6AM road traffic, otherwise quiet. We liked the city and the port. Around 7PM the place was almost fully parked."
108749,2582652,4,merger8,19/02/2023,"Parking enabled for motorhomes and campers. It has water and empty black water. There are only about 9 spots and it fills up fast. It should be noted that all sites have a slope. For the rest, you can spend the night quietly."
108749,2578254,2,diego66,15/02/2023,"We could have done better, but not worse! Steeply sloping area, directly on a busy road. The night is quiet, but from 06.00 the passage of cars and trucks begins. Unusable loading and unloading area with a step to reach it. In short, you stop right if you are on the last resort and you can't find anything better."
108749,2577500,3,Matz3055,14/02/2023,Good clean place that is just off a road less traveled at night. Great that you can do V&E there for free.
108749,2560418,3,AxelTomm,25/01/2023,"Place slightly inclined - very quiet at night. A few meters to the city center or the sea. Very good disposal for gray water and toilet. If only some idiots didn't need the clean water tap to flush the toilet cassette ... and would dispose of their ""clean water"" directly on the asphalt ...."
108749,2550054,5,freedompeople,12/01/2023,We were only there to dispose of and fill up with water. But you would have slept well there.
108749,2546113,5,silvia71cat,08/01/2023,"We only use it for emptying gray and black water. Thank you very much to the town hall for enabling us these areas for free. The emptying of black water is done by means of a cover that is raised on the ground, a pity that many do not know this and use the gray water grid to empty the black water."
108749,2540649,3,jonatanpardo,04/01/2023,"Despite the unevenness, we compensated by parked upside down since our car is tilted as standard. In addition, wedges can be used without problem. As for the noise, there is a lot after 7am since the road gives access to the N-340. They also tend to start trucks very early from the parking lot next door. We sleep regularly. If you can, go to the Delta to sleep."
108749,2539528,4,philea83,03/01/2023,Good location to stop and especially to empty gray water and black water. Fill up with clean water. All this for free it deserves at least 4 stars. For sleeping it is not indicated.
108749,2535286,4,martingallat,31/12/2022,"It's great for topping up and draining water, but sleeping somewhere else down by the harbor was great"
108749,2493340,2,Thetravelman,13/11/2022,"Seemed safe but very noisy. Hearing cars passing by all day and night long.
Impracticable to service with a long vehicle."
108749,2492741,1,DolorsyJuan,12/11/2022,"very inclined, mosquitoes, we have not used unloading and filling point. outside the center and the ambient zone. good walk around the port. We have eaten a good rice and cuttlefish and looked for another place to end the day and sleep. thanks to the city council for trying, with all the space that is flatter it would be more successful"
108749,2487994,1,Route-66,08/11/2022,"Asphalt parking, near a road and roundabout. When driving away from the waste water discharge, I drove damage under the camper. There is a significant curb where people drive off and the drain pipe was damaged. We didn't stay."
108749,2427571,3,AgurAlber,06/10/2022,"It is fine if you are passing through, because the charm of the town, beach and gardens 2 km away"
108749,2413076,4,jcsgalvez,30/09/2022,"Despite the incline it is not a serious drawback. We have had a very quiet night. We ate delicious rice in a local restaurant, bought local products and took a boat trip to the mussel platform. So that later some say that motorhome tourism is not interesting."
108749,2411174,5,camilo57,29/09/2022,We have slept a very good night. We have made use of all the services without problem. there is a little slope that is neutralized with chocks or by turning the motorhome around like I did. a reference site to return. We have also eaten a first class paella in a restaurant. So we are very happy to leave here.
108749,2317645,3,bettaejany,29/08/2022,stop only for loading and unloading water (very functional and thanks to the municipality!). I would not sleep there because it is close to the road and on a slope
108749,2302260,2,somosnomadas,25/08/2022,Two Stars for the free service by the town hall but it is very inclined… not even with chocks! Wasps and poorly clean the water change area. On the outskirts of town. somewhat noisy
108749,2258327,1,xumake,17/08/2022,"Extremely inclined, not even with chocks can you be half level"
108749,2118286,3,SPQR56,24/07/2022,Lots of slope. Water: more than 425 ppm. Not drinkable for me!
108749,2100292,3,Fuencis,21/07/2022,"We have only used it for emptying water, both gray and black (It says that black emptying is paid for but payment was not enabled, and yet it was open for use). It has no shadow."
108749,2033849,1,AlbertRC,03/07/2022,"Visited 07/02/2022, it will be the time but it is infested with biting mosquitoes. Inclined asphalt, it depends on how you want to position your vehicle does not help. Curiously, there is a car park on the opposite sidewalk, but they continue to park on this site. For one night if you're in a hurry it's worth it but it doesn't have any charm."
108749,2031714,1,LT35YaiOi,02/07/2022,"Not recommended at all, very inclined to be a paved area, on these dates, in addition, the area is invaded by mosquitoes, more than 10 bites in less than 20 minutes. In addition, the town, for tastes, but it is very urban and lacks an old town or something walkable that deserves the torture of mosquito bites. Maybe better on other dates..."
108749,2019301,2,llaasaiel,28/06/2022,Slightly skewed is an understatement. Shady would also be an exaggeration. Hardly usable. The village youth uses the street for kickstarts. not recommendable
108749,1967091,4,AR63,11/06/2022,"We spent 2 nights in this area, during the week, in mid-May. All services ok and free, there were 3 of us, quiet night, traffic resumes normally in the morning. Good location for visiting the Ebro Delta, for us on a motorbike. Thanks to the municipality..."
108749,1864976,4,tonibaker,02/05/2022,Perfectly fine for a night but the picnic area under the pine trees opposite was full of glass and dog poo. We decided to move on so didn’t stay but made use of the tank emptying. We didn’t like the look of the drinking water so didn’t use that.
108749,1845360,5,UTERALF,22/04/2022,Thank you to the community for this place. Supply and disposal are also free of charge. Immediate proximity to the town and not far from the beautiful harbor. The neighborhood to the soccer field is not disturbing. The space above the actual parking space is ideal for larger campers or with a trailer. The place is recommended for an overnight stay in transit.
108749,1844477,3,KILIANBERGA,21/04/2022,"If it weren’t for the slope it would be a good area. However, to visit the village and have a good lunch, go to the cinema. And to sleep, with shoes you are sure to fall asleep! Few places."
108749,1826732,3,labeaga,16/04/2022,We spent the night in this area. Very calm
108749,1825543,4,ErGe88,15/04/2022,"It is good to spend a night and be able to empty waters. Site with little charm and car parks very close to each other. However, it perfectly fulfills its function and is free."
108749,1822883,5,EmyBikeWorldPiera,15/04/2022,The Area is fine to spend the night but we had to leave...Not a single place...There were more cars with people sleeping inside than motorhomes...
108749,1821582,4,MarkAm,14/04/2022,Area with all services except light. Area with paved ground and a little unevenness. Very close to the center and the port taking a walk. Thanks to the City Council for this great area!!!!
108749,1813173,4,Dune49,10/04/2022,"It was 03/17/22 Terminal very clean, I was able to fill up with water, drain black and gray water, all for free, thanks to the municipality... Yes the parking lot is also immaculate, but the corner is for us without much interest, we did not stay to sleep. We continue to Barcelona..."
108749,1781877,4,GomiRa,13/03/2022,"Near the center of Sant Carles de la Rapita, free filling and emptying of water."

108749,1763642,4,LeBary,23/02/2022,Very good for filling drinking water and emptying gray water. Seems sloping to sleep without wedge. Noisy without too much privacy as well.
108749,1750382,3,Nanou49,08/02/2022,"Clean parking, nickel for the day, 1km5 from the city center, but Bcp too noisy, starting trucks at 5am in the upper parking lot.."
108749,1738324,5,Natas,21/01/2022,"Excellent service point for emptying gray water, free (drinking) water. Along a fairly busy road. We did not spend the night here."
108749,1734163,4,rollanderic,15/01/2022,"Parking very good for troubleshooting, especially when you have just been fired from a parking lot without any ban in Peniscola... In addition, water available and gray and black water drain. Thank you to the municipality."
108749,1718322,3,Didiruca06,29/12/2021,"For what we used it was parking to visit the Rapid. Inclined yes, and a walk from town. To sleep I do not think I would stay here."
108749,1710409,5,Carlosvictor,15/12/2021,"12/15/21 a place as the compi says, slightly inclined, some balance it with chocks, (although it is prohibited with billboard) emptying of grays, poty, and load of drinking water, everything very clean, thanks to the town hall."

108749,1587299,1,MartaAragon,17/09/2021,"It is appreciated to be able to fill and empty waters but to sleep we went to another place. A lot of slope (ideal for taking marble races), unwelcoming, it smells terrible in the gray water drain ... a greeting!"
108749,1541054,4,GonzalezCaroline,02/09/2021,We stayed for 4 days. Very charming town and welcoming people. Motorhome area along the road. so noisy. Parking and free water. Very nice municipal officers and policemen. THANK YOU
108749,1538921,1,lorax90,01/09/2021,"It's pretty bad vibes .. It's very lonely and it's next to a truck parking lot. When we arrived and saw it, we passed by. You don't feel like staying."
108749,1471253,5,yeleniaamohedoo,17/08/2021,"We went to empty water and fill it again, everything is fine, the parking lot was empty even though there was a caravan parked that looked like it had been there for a long time, for the rest all the services well, no price :)"
108749,1456526,4,JORDI2EURA,14/08/2021,We must thank the initiative but things must be maintained. The site for sewage is sketched and full of paper. The city council should have someone pass by often to clean up. The same goes for the platform for the grays. As sometimes happens it does something and leaves. If you want to be calmer about 100 meters above there is the parking lot of the cemetery. Thanks anyway.
108749,1364526,4,anitayriki,25/07/2021,Asphalt parking with gray and black emptying and free water. you can spend the night a good place for a stop.
108749,1361180,3,carlosbenicasim,25/07/2021,"Good for filling / emptying waters, poor access to enter or exit the road that passes, due to the incline it made us go to Peñiscola, which is half an hour away."
108749,1340626,5,Miguelmmartins,19/07/2021,Nice and clean space for maintenance. We had lunch in the other side of the road.

108749,1229034,4,Francis2408,31/05/2021,"Free supply and disposal in a parking lot, the flap for the black water doesn't just hold up and fresh water you have to hold down the button, fills up slowly. But everything is free and works!"

108749,1185667,3,Rafa58,05/05/2021,"We spent one night and it was quiet, paved terrain and with some unevenness, but thank the town hall for the possibility of being able to sleep and refuel. The more areas for AC we have the better, so thank you."
108749,1168667,2,MonyGab2020,05/04/2021,"We have loaded clean water and emptied the gray ones. The black waters we have not dared because it seemed that it was muffled, perhaps that is why it was all full of shit around."
108749,1168181,4,maiaterra,05/04/2021,"Very quiet area to sleep, 15 minutes walk from the port. You can fill it with drinking water. Negative that someone emptied black water into the gray grill and was disgusted, everything in its place !!!"

You do not feel like sleeping there, but still thank the people! Let's hope they unblock the sewage, a lot of disinfecting their hands when entering the establishments but nothing to clean the shit from the AC area."
108749,1113565,3,Raybak,08/11/2020,It doesn't make you want to stay there and sleep. The black waters are blocked. But at least it helps out and it's free.
108749,1109099,4,jpac5919,29/10/2020,Everything is repaired and to do the oil changes is now nickel. Thanks to the town.
108749,1100029,1,jessy74,20/10/2020,Went on October 19 this was cleaned but the black water pipe -WC- was not unblocked so it overflows. it is necessary to empty in the main grid and to clean after. Attention only one tap so caution you must disinfect. The terminal is not suitable and it might be possible for those who speak Spanish to report these problems to the town hall.
108749,1090637,1,yapagare,12/10/2020,"It looks like it is abandoned, very neglected, dirty, we did not take water because it made us very disgusting, the shit of those who, even being plugged, have emptied their sewage is lying around on the ground. we didn't even come close, the parking lot was very steep; come on, they have the area to say that there is an area in the town when they kick you off the coast. disgusting!"

108749,1079645,2,Enfelen,03/10/2020,"It is an area simply to not let you park in the town or surroundings, with the excuse that they have an area ... It is inclined and you cannot win with the chocks ... Unusable and unhygienic emptying area, Road stuck because of the noise it's constant. A shame another site that does not want our money ... Good luck"
108749,961570,2,EliseVictorciriviera,14/08/2020,"We have been there for two days because we live in the caravan and we have to work online during the week. We are alone all the time. The ground is sloping and the motorhome area is poorly maintained. It has free services but the clean water tap is a bit bad and to remove the toilet, which many people leave poo on the floor."
108749,860508,1,folerpa,11/07/2020,This place must have a couple of years old abandoned. Dirty and foul water area. Nothing recommended when passing a road next to it and being very noisy.
108749,849053,2,xondi,05/07/2020,"To go empty shit and fill water is fine, the tap is threaded and is a push button, the kind of leaving your hand glued until you feel it. It would be the last place where I would sleep in this town, there being other better points, since it is a beach bag and has 0 charm. It is for what it is and see you later, Lucas."

108749,771379,3,Dinamita,22/01/2020,"Very well paved, but on a slope, very wide squares, the emptying of sewage is clogged, and a tap tap without thread to adapt coupling for drinking water and cleaning of the black water tank, but you have to thank the city council for the initiative of making an area for motorhomes"
108749,768091,3,RedDog,13/01/2020,Stopped to use the services yesterday 12/01/2020. Entrance was interesting for our 9m unit. Plenty of room once inside. Services were free. Water point has no connection so bucket or watering can required.
108749,766186,3,Ditschis,08/01/2020,"Uneven floor space, good removal and supply options."
108749,761511,1,clomax,01/01/2020,"Very disappointing, too steep, isolated terrain, we have been here for 10 days, we only come here for services. When will a real motorhome area in Sant Carles even pay."
108749,757832,5,latorsche,27/12/2019,"All services are there and free in addition, thank you the town. we did not sleep here because the terrain was too steep for our taste. We just did our shopping at the Mercadona."
108749,751346,1,ulysesss,08/12/2019,"Very dirty not worth going, droppings on the floor. The town hall should not allow such a place."
108749,746985,1,Landy130,25/11/2019,"The faeces flap is blocked, you can use at most the grid of the bottom outlet, where already hung some toilet paper and fecal matter. There is a flush button over the clogged flap, a faucet at the side of the column, I do not want to remove any drinking water here. The place is sloping and next to the street, in my opinion not recommended."
108749,745992,5,jordibella,22/11/2019,"Emptying sewage in poor condition, just a tap to wash the poti and load water"

108749,690322,1,abas,14/09/2019,Area without service. It is not enough to make a place to take away from the rest of the town. and meet the spit. I left because I could only empty waste. It has no water to clean the remains and chemical and fill a clean tank ......
108749,667029,4,tulle,29/08/2019,"Easy to access, there is only the gray water drain that works. The terminal for water does not work, close to the city center and the port. Next to it there is a separate truck area"

108749,439296,1,VeganLife,12/03/2019,We passed today. The service column has been installed but is not yet operational. A panel indicates that the cost will be 3 euros. Possibility to download gray water for free.

108749,425586,4,Porsche718,30/01/2019,Great spot for a free stay. Fresh new tarmac with a new dump station for grey water. No other facilities.  Bit of a slope but OK if you have ramps. 10 minute walk to town centre and new Mercadonna supermarket.
108749,424490,1,Wal0606,25/01/2019,"I can only say with horror. Right on the street! Actually, this is a truck parking space. For one night it would go but the municipality of Sant Carles could have found something better !!! Opposite a small park, go well for ""Gassi""."

108758,2931459,5,ellieandwillt,06/07/2023,Beautiful stop while making the journey around Bardenas Reales! Busy spot and people left big gaps when parking so it was difficult to find a place to park - please park a bit closer to one another so everyone can fit in. It’s next to the famous rock formation and this is one of the only hiking trails that is open at the moment - I recommend stopping at the tourist information centre to find out where it is possible to go.
108758,2784936,5,jurij94,25/05/2023,"Nice place for stop, make som photos, lunch and go away."
108758,1860965,5,Yasper,30/04/2022,"Super great area! You can drive the camper in a circle once. stunning. The road is compacted and can be driven on with the usual Womos even when it rains. There is always the possibility to turn off the circular route, but watch out for the road. We stood in the mud for 24 hours because nobody could pull us out. Probably the only legal way to stay there."
108758,1776081,4,Boch51,07/03/2022,Probably the main parking to visit the pretty rock and the desert. You also can walk around or even drive around the desert and stop at other spots. Night forbidden.

108758,1150266,1,KinitoSpiti,12/03/2021,"A dirt car park without more, there are no services of any kind. The last 4 km is a flat but bumpy dirt track. It is worth a visit for the rock figure of Castildetierra and the desert surroundings. Starting point for excursions by bike, on foot or with the vehicle (only on the enabled tracks). EYE! THE OVERNIGHT IS FORBIDDEN. The guards pass and warn in bad ways"
108758,1072391,4,jagger4night,27/09/2020,"Visited with: Motorhome L = 7.5m H = 3.3m Good place to stop and visit surroundings. Positive: views, access and parking space Negative: no services * Do not spend the night"
108758,1038846,5,Paichi,10/09/2020,"Parking to take the typical posture photo. It is 3.5 km along a loose stone road where going at 30 km / h with a home vehicle is quite a feat because it sounds as if it were going to split in half. The site is cool, but you have to take into account what I review"
108758,794533,5,tudelano,12/03/2020,Castildetierra is mandatory when visiting Bardenas. Perfect for parking and taking a walk or bike tour. The prohibition to stay overnight is well specified.

108811,1742200,4,Kurt-Suender,27/01/2022,Good for the day. Too loud for the night. But you can quickly walk to the city or to or under the bridge.

108816,3118949,2,elpernales,11/08/2023,"for the day, great. cool waters to withstand the heat and very well. At night, the chavs from the surrounding towns come to make eights with their shabby tuning and burn wheels. the civil guard had to be called in the wee hours of the morning and the next day, more of the same. Valid place only to be for the day."

108816,1150636,5,jorconde,13/03/2021,Local enxebre but very pleasant we have taken a good dip at this time although the pond was not cared for. we have gone to sleep in Vilalba.
108816,1147420,5,Kaour,06/03/2021,"A unique place, the water is at 23 all year round. Free access no need to consume at the refreshment stall, it is a public place that does not belong to anyone. The refreshment bar was closed anyway."
108816,1101232,3,ju1308,21/10/2020,"As said by others, it is an outdoor thermal pool managed by the adorable owner of the refreshment bar. The least of things is to consume something at home. This is also the way to get the key for the toilet. Unfortunately, a team of morons did some sort of rodeo with their cars in the middle of the night, which is disturbing to say the least ..."
108816,862710,5,SaMoMu,12/07/2020,Very nice place inside. Perfect stop on the way to go with children: the bath in the pond is free and in the morning it is crystal clear. The manager of the bar is very friendly and makes us feel welcome. The bar opens at 8 and the toilet is for bar customers. On Saturday night a bottle of the youth of the town but nothing worrisome.
108816,860997,1,hippypirri,11/07/2020,"Some locals edges almost hit us for going with the dog, at the entrance there was no sign warning of the ban, only within 100 meters of the entrance, at the top of some lampposts, about 10/15 meters from height. I suppose they put it there so that it can be seen from a helicopter. This is not Galicia"
108816,755361,1,Nomadicats,20/12/2019,Whole area completely flooded and obviously inaccessible. Highly dangerous during the rainy season!
108816,717870,5,MrsAnnieRoberts,10/10/2019,Excellent spot with friendly locals. Great for a walk around the village too.
108816,558886,5,Moira108,17/07/2019,I stayed here four nights and was made very welcome by the people at the cafe (they even brought some bread for me). Very busy on sunny and evenings but with a very relaxed atmosphere.  A little disturbance at night with boy racers but not too bad. The free amenities more than made up for it. Highly recommend.
108816,411798,5,Frankieee,04/12/2018,"Perfect. Flat, there was literally nobody. In the morning local guy came to swim.
Really nice, recommended."

Unfortunately we don’t speak Spanish well, so potentially if we’d been able to properly communicate with him he looked as though he may have been saying technically you’re not allowed stay but if we followed some rules he may have let us. He said something to us about there being no permit for campers in the mountains."
108824,1212269,5,nigsin,23/05/2021,"Very nice place to stay. We asked for permission at the hut. With a few rules that should be followed in nature anyway, we were allowed to stay here. Great view!"
108824,787288,5,CorrecaminosXT,26/02/2020,"A super quiet place (in February / March at least). The road can be a bit long but it is worth it, it is also concreted in part and there are several places to stop halfway that are also very good."
108824,503928,5,guidem,04/06/2019,"Great view, access is actually quite alright, pretty steep at some points but we did it with a L1H1 2x4 Transit with allterrain tires and had no difficulty at all to get there.

As for the view... It's totally worth the dirt roads. The terrain is flat enough to level the van with little effort. There is a little highway noise far away, but other than that it's completely isolated (but with 4G reception for those working from the van)"
108824,500293,1,Jeffesor,01/06/2019,To be discouraged .. chaotic way. We have a 4x4 van and punctured a tire. Galley to turn around and two fingers to damage the housing. So we stayed on a parking below which offers a magnificent view of the huge lake.
108824,429325,5,barou,14/02/2019,"Magnificent views overlooking the lake and in the distance the mountains as far as the eye can see. I went with a motorhome of 6 m without problem. Chaotic path but at the end of the road, happiness :)"

But at midnight, a strange man who is unclear in his words asks us if we have drugs, then tells us that the police called him because a suspicious van is parked...then tells us that he is from the police and called his colleagues. In short, big scare. After he left, we quickly moved on...."

108832,2483289,5,youzoulel,05/11/2022,"Perfect spot, true to the description. The fountain seems closed when we pass, probably because of the summer season. Trash nearby. Little highway noise for those who have fragile sleep but we highly recommend it!"

108832,659814,1,dielectricus,26/08/2019,Isolated hermitage without lighting at night. It gave us a feeling of insecurity. Location somewhat isolated. We found a strange vehicle with strange people. We left.
108832,629374,4,clodopedo,15/08/2019,"A quiet place and the highway traffic is far away and does not bother. It has garbage container and 2 sources. We have spent a night on the road between Burgos and Madrid. The water from the 2 sources has a yellowish color, characteristic that the land gives us as we have read, but we do not know if you can drink."
108832,474935,5,EddyEddy,03/05/2019,"I agree it's a charming spot. The water tap on the wind turbine side has a threaded connection, and there are rubbish bins. Access is via one of three dirt road approaches, so check your map carefully first, or enable dirt roads in your satellite navigator."

Like everywhere in Nazaré there is a guy helping you to park and wants a Tip for it, he probably also checks that nobody breaks into the Camper. Even though he is not an official I would suggest to support him to support you"
108858,1776479,5,madsun,07/03/2022,Lovely self service laundrette. 3 washers and 3 tumble dryers of different sizes and prices. Easy to use and is pre-loaded with detergent and softener so no need to bring your own. Average cycle of the washers were 30 mins and the clothes came out smelling fresh. Didn’t use the tumble dryers.
108858,1693843,5,Verreisetante,20/11/2021,"There are 3 dryers and 3 washing machines. the washing machines are in different sizes M &) L & XL. the prices include detergent that is automatically dosed into the drum. You can also pay with bills, the machine changes into small change. A TV shortens the waiting time, there is free Wi-Fi, a table to fold the dry laundry, and laundry baskets are also available."

108867,2036274,4,L.Vieira,04/07/2022,"Spacious park, in the center of a very friendly village. The night was very calm. It just doesn't give 5 stars because it doesn't have a service area. I will make the suggestion to the municipality."
108867,1886803,5,hganhao,13/05/2022,Car park at the rear of town hall. No services but very calm and peaceful. The city has good restaurants and good hypermarkets.

108894,2758419,4,Chrislan_at,17/05/2023,"We came here because parking in the area by the river is an impossible mission. We slept very well. Quiet and we felt very safe. The bad, the noise of the cars."

108894,1883850,5,Stratters,11/05/2022,Obviously no facilities - it’s a car park ! But great location for exploring and the girls in the tourist info were very helpful.
108894,1582336,4,Johanna50,16/09/2021,Safe place for the tourist office. Slept well for 2 nights. Many people come and go with their car until late. Perfect location for the city. I've only seen regular parking spaces (campervan).
108894,1527735,4,UsuaUsuki,29/08/2021,We slept with the van the night from Saturday to Sunday. Well-lit parking lot next to the road. But I'ts not bad. 15 minutes from the historic center.
108894,1127255,3,javiers,02/01/2021,"Let's see, it is a parking lot next to the beginning of a highway, then it has noise. Also, it is not very visually pleasing. But there is little else in Cuenca."
108894,942859,1,asiererci,09/08/2020,Parking inadvisable. Lots of traffic noise.
108894,840254,4,Horchatilla,28/06/2020,"Place to spend the night without problem, in the squares that Bus puts. If you leave the skylights open, you can hear traffic throughout the night because it is next to a fairly busy street. The staff of the Tourist Office, very friendly. A good walk to the Upper City of Cuenca with excellent views."
108894,754079,4,Floral42,16/12/2019,"2 quiet nights. Railway side, but no train at night. Facing the park. 20 minutes walk from the old town. Very well."
108894,752040,4,Oscarfalgas,09/12/2019,"We spent two nights there, after asking the tourist office, (which is right there), they told us there was no problem sleeping even if I put a bus on the floor. It is only parking, without any service."
108894,740918,5,Samolo,09/11/2019,"Good place to park and spend the night with a camper or small caravan, perfect if you want to walk downtown. Relatively quiet It has nothing nice not services but fulfills its function to do night after the tapas in the historic center of Cuenca. It also has the information office in front."
108894,423260,4,SuyBob,18/01/2019,"We do not spend the night, we only spend the day seeing the historic center. We parked right where the description indicates. There were remains as before there was a barrier and they had to charge to park but not anymore."

108898,1084972,4,Ralou,07/10/2020,Attached photo of the poster prohibiting parking in this place. At 100 meters there is a good esplanade where to spend the night without problem.
108898,568388,4,Aixa,22/07/2019,Very quiet place. It is a small mountain town with a great view. The fountain next to the bakery and bakery are very good. Suitable for an overnight stay
108898,462460,5,Laietta,21/04/2019,"Very good to park and make route, also the oven next door!"
108904,2749548,1,ManonEnSoofie,14/05/2023,Steepest hill I’ve ever ridden. Must be honest I don’t feel save at all. Not spending the night here
108904,2394116,3,adelelouis,22/09/2022,Parking ok for one night in Bilbao. A bit noisy in the early evening then again early in the morning. The car park remains well shaded in the morning. It helps!
108904,2140461,1,SexinVan,29/07/2022,When we arrived at 12:00 AM we found a car with a broken window. We left the place.
108904,2130176,3,JoaquimCoca,27/07/2022,"We arrived in the afternoon, and we were able to park without problems. Other campers arrived later. The night has been very quiet. In the early hours of the morning, the local police came and did a walk-around. No services, and a bit dirty."
108904,2086294,3,anamungar,17/07/2022,We had a quiet night. The parking does not have any service and is quite dirty. It was the only option we found to sleep within the city about 25 minutes walk from the old town.
108904,1945471,3,Andrea-Dinis,04/06/2022,"Very complicated for a 7.30m AC... the spaces on one side are car-sized, those on the other side too, but there is a grass/slope area that depends on which space a large AC could enter. In our case, we could not stop since the squares with more space had cars parked or did not give the height with the trees. Pretty dirty area."
108904,1936321,4,ConnieLiam,01/06/2022,Slept well and felt safe. There was an aire that was closed for the next few days so we had to find another spot whilst we travelled into Bilbao town. No facilities but provided a safe place to go at night.
108904,1820215,4,keetiekar,14/04/2022,As good as it gets near the city! Parking spot in the middle of a small but hilly park. Spent a very quiet night without problems. City center by foot 30 min and subway at 10 min.
108904,1794987,4,Teok,25/03/2022,"Car park 25min walk from the center of Bilbao. There is a fairly steep climb to access it. Few places but cars don't stay long. First night very quiet, the second came young drunk people with music, the police pass but they don't chase anyone out of the park."
108904,1772037,5,madsun,03/03/2022,"Great spot just off the road of the busy streets of Bilbao. Felt very safe leaving vans there. The address didn’t take me directly to the car park, and it’s a one way system around the block, so here is a more direct one: Larreagaburu Parkea
48004 Bilbao
Bizkaia, Spain."
108904,1771878,5,Jueson6,03/03/2022,"Excellent parking spot for vans in the middle of the city, very isolated from site and away from roads or any walking routes so felt safe leaving the van their all day. Didn’t stay the night but I would have comfortably if I needed to. Highly recommend"
108904,1259903,5,AdrianCotelo,17/06/2021,"Good option if parking is not closer to the center, steep slope and need to maneuver a bit when there are hardly any spaces available"
108904,1065340,4,Juanangarcia,23/09/2020,"Perfect to see the city, large holes for the car and only 15 minutes from the old town. The area seemed safe. We had no problems"
108904,917512,3,CristianKrusty,01/08/2020,We have spent the night without much trouble. The police showed up in the morning without telling us anything. Some car at night that has woken us up and the visit of a mosquito. A good place if no other options today.
108904,889815,5,ivanfermena,22/07/2020,"Very good place, we stayed one night and it is just a short walk from the center, 15 minutes from the old town. We went by van, I do not know an AC but if it has a somewhat hard slope at the beginning but it can be climbed without problem, something that also makes few people climb. The police came up and didn't tell us anything. Recommended."
108904,745453,5,claramas,21/11/2019,"Very good place to be in the city. There are no services but it is quite flat. We spent one night in November, when arriving in the middle of the afternoon there was no place, but waiting for 10 minutes, they were left free. No noise at night."
108904,657232,1,cabaldi,24/08/2019,"Important notice: do not park caravans or vans in this place. We came to enjoy the big week in Bilbao and came back without suitcases ... During the night the whole caravan was looted (suitcases, clothes, goods ...) they also stole another caravan and 2 vans the same night. Do not park here !!!!"

108907,3276188,5,LaYoguivan,09/09/2023,Spectacular place next to the castle. The charming townspeople. Small problem with flies and mosquitoes. Spectacular sunset. Very quiet to sleep.
108907,3159686,5,boheme85,16/08/2023,We stopped for lunch. Magnificent view at the foot of the Chateau. I think we can sleep.
108907,2589286,5,Duzifahrer,24/02/2023,"Great place on the meadow right next to the castle. Sensational view! Very windy. Attention, do not drive through the narrow village in a large mobile home."
108907,2228425,5,123lil,13/08/2022,"Very quiet place to spend the night. You can stand in front of the castle or to one side. There's not much of an incline, so we don't need the chocks. There is a children's playground next door with a fountain and litter bins."
108907,1576769,4,ChrisnRay,14/09/2021,Stayed one night at this curious castle. We were left alone although several locals walked close by us to check us out. During the night the wind became intense causing us to move out of the direct wind for fear of losing our solar panels. If it’s calm then park right up by the wall near the play area if not park between the play area and buildings under the trees.
108907,1549366,4,LinaKex,05/09/2021,"Beautiful place to stay, quiet, most precious sunset, water and playground in front of the castle, but in the night the castle is lit up with big lamps so don't park in front of them if you want to stay for the night, also some people taking walks around the castle until night (ca. 23:30h)"
108907,442142,5,Rockburner,20/03/2019,"Fantastic to be able to park right next to the castle! Lovely views.
Somewhat exposed to strong winds though!"
108907,411162,5,Yureka,01/12/2018,"Good spot for one night, the village next door seems desert in winter. Very nice view of the surrounding land and medieval atmosphere."

108910,1728710,3,FalcoBordegas,07/01/2022,"It is a clean and hard car park, it is not completely level but you can protect yourself from the wind, which is important for campers with a raised roof."
108910,1175467,4,DAF-T244,18/04/2021,"Very quiet and not very busy. I was lucky enough to have a snack stall here on Saturday / Sunday during the day. Baguettes, crepes & coffee while corona was cool. It gets very cold up here at night."
108910,759817,5,CanKerberus,30/12/2019,"It is somewhat inclined, there is very calm coverage and sheltered from the ideal wind to leave the camper or the ac and go up the mountain"

108932,2630824,5,Faniju,30/03/2023,"Parked in this spacious and secure car park from Tuesday to Thursday. Convenient for visiting the city by bike (20 min ride to reach the center). Young people park at the front of the car park at night, so it is best to stand at the back for more privacy and less noise. Attention Madrid by bike is complex due to traffic, long slopes and few cycle paths."
108932,2596544,4,PowByte,03/03/2023,"Spent here a quite night. But currently there is a construction side near by, worked woke us up very early in the morning."
108932,2557661,4,Gaston1977,22/01/2023,The place is very good to make a stop to visit the city. It is spacious and with a good location since it has nearby services. It is also a quiet area and you can visit the cemetery (whoever likes it).
108932,2540720,5,jrv222,04/01/2023,"It is an asphalt parking lot, we spent a very quiet night, without noise, there is a bus stop and metro very close, about 200m away there is a churreria with some XXL cheers to start the day with energy......"

108932,2385413,5,modovan.ph,19/09/2022,"We arrived Friday night until Monday at noon and the truth is that there were no complaints. Very quiet place, Mercadona 1 block away and the Metro 10 minutes walking"
108932,2282331,4,noevila13,22/08/2022,"There are trees that provide shade during the day, a sign indicates that you can't park on Fridays because there is a market (although only in the morning), without services, it's just parking, but we spent the night very quietly and it's very close to the metro! I recommend it to spend a quiet night before continuing on the road, very close to the M30 and the M40"
108932,1896589,4,doriane3004,17/05/2022,"Nice place, possibility of being in the shade. On the other hand, a lot of passages whether children, family and mechanic? No worries about leaving the Van all day"
108932,1568574,4,alaincurt,11/09/2021,"Quiet night, a few young people but discreet, perfect parking, safe area. Great location for downtown as explained in the first review. Little anecdote, we went into town all day, and when we returned to the camper van, window open, and yes we had forgotten to close it, like what here is correct."
108932,1295233,4,MaDoDu,04/07/2021,"We have been the night of Friday and Saturday. Quite quiet, except for a car that played music at night. Mercadona 50 meters away and ""Almudena"" metro stop 5 minutes away. To visit Madrid is a good option, we have left the motorhome parked all day and we have not had any problems. During the day there is little shade but the ground is asphalt and flat."
108932,1268552,4,mario-pe,21/06/2021,"Friday market so it is not recommended to park on Thursday night. It takes about 3 minutes to the La Almudena metro, which makes parking very convenient for visiting the city. It is also close to the cemetery that, although it may not seem like it, has some very interesting monumental tombs, the civil one is also good. The best nearby bars are “Mirador de Candeleda” and “El Figón”"
108932,1243219,5,elisuca,08/06/2021,"A very good site! Zero noises (at night a car came with music but immediately left) and there is a small tree to look for its shade. There is a market sign on Fridays, but we slept on a Monday and we have not had any problems. There is a bus stop right there and a metro nearby."

108933,3221976,3,peter7676,26/08/2023,"We spent 1 night in the parking lot (2 other vans). Not very clean, a few local cars that spend the evening there but no worries. We were able to dine at the water's edge and see the boats go fishing, very nice view. Good night and very close to the start of the tour of the caves by boat. The plus: the boat tour motorhome has a battery booster!"
108933,3054291,4,Txivero,31/07/2023,"We try to sleep here. Upon arrival we asked a company that rented canoes, if they could. They told us that even though they were private port land, they weren't usually averse to it. In the nearby castle, they told us that street people lived and slept. Although the site was cool, we preferred to look for other options."
108933,2687709,5,ademortier,22/04/2023,Excellent for visiting caves. Lots of comings and goings at night. We slept in the Lidl parking lot.
108933,2509840,1,BaFu,01/12/2022,"now here as well , police from time to time comes buy and clears the place from campers. Looks like the whole Algarve got this no Camper policy now. but to be honest, maybe it was just to many campers . maybe time to test Maroko in Winter"
108933,2221901,5,CaporalColas,12/08/2022,"We spent a very quiet night there, some shaded corners, and 2/3 campers with us, perfect"
108933,2169976,5,NicoOuttier,03/08/2022,Perfect place to sleep in Portimao the week of the Sardine Festival! No service but a feeling of security reinforced by the presence of other motorhomes/vans (and many sinners during the day!)
108933,2102102,5,vstrxd,21/07/2022,"A pretty view at night, quiet, quite a lot of traffic because it's a walking path. Someone is squatting the old fort, don't come in!"
108933,1737854,1,TrudiToni,21/01/2022,"We just parked here for a few hours to go on a boat trip. In the afternoon they broke into our autocaravan by smashing the drivers window, took two laptops, camera plus equipment and a music speaker. Not safe at all, even in off season :("
108933,1728443,4,NatashaBOK,07/01/2022,Stayed one night towards the end of the road. No other campers at the time but Fisherman during the day. Felt safe to leave the camper there while exploring the city and the beaches.
108933,1701570,5,DOMED,02/12/2021,"A little further from this vacant lot, you will be on concrete facing the sea. The view is much more pleasant. Near the museum, not far from the center. We slept very well there. Police in the port area next door."
108933,1619449,5,chloegreen,01/10/2021,"We stayed here for 3 nights, a couple other campers too, not bothering anyone at all, lots of space for others to park. No facilities but easy access into the town via the port path. A few kids driving around on the Saturday night but polite and no trouble!"
108933,1537555,4,beneblazquez,01/09/2021,"We have slept next to the entrance to the port on a quiet sand esplanade and cleanly as we always do as we always do various garbage from bottles, in that we also look like Portuguese and Spanish"
108933,1489579,2,benimar345,20/08/2021,"It was empty. We have not dared to park, but it comes as is according to the description. Next to the soccer field."
108933,1017090,3,milhunt,31/08/2020,"As close to the centre as you can get for free and relatively quiet for how central it is. lots of cars do come and go during the evening and night however. nice views across the harbour with fishing boats coming and going often. under a ruined monastery within which locals do sleep. police are clearly not too bothered about  campers staying overnight. lots of cyclists, pedestrians and runners come through in the morning."
108933,780524,2,bricolo40,15/02/2020,"We passed last night but we did not stay, too many cars coming to turn, maybe a good place to see. We left for the Castellos car park."

108933,481974,3,L.Sim,12/05/2019,"It's ok for one night, as it is hard to find a better place in a city... not really nice, but as silent as it can be in a city like Portimao."
108934,3283388,5,eidermou29,11/09/2023,"We spent one night and because we have a return ferry, otherwise there would be another night. Super quiet, clean bathrooms with good showers, very nice reception girls, a cove a 3-minute walk away, lots of shade, emptying and filling…€44 for two people, a van and electricity. I would repeat."

Sea within walking distance and very beautiful. Santa Eulalia is also easily accessible by bike. The staff was very nice, especially Monika from the bar, it can get louder in the evenings until 11 p.m., if it bothers you, it's better to choose the back seats. I thought it was great, planned 2 nights, stayed 5 nights."
108934,2470493,3,kuenna22,30/10/2022,"Location on the beach Staff friendly and helpful Toilets and showers always clean Small supermarket next door, prices ok o gray water only with buckets o cheap compared to Ibiza o plots small - washing machine only washes cold - sink only cold - black water has to be emptied in normal toilet - Noisy late in the evening at the end of October (barbecue area, play area)"
108934,2428635,5,Baitlers,07/10/2022,we loved it very much. only stayed one night but want the charm straight away. very natural and kept small. everyone helps everyone and there is even a small area where people can post their services or give away books and dvds etc. Absolute opposite of a huge 4 star campsite and therefore perfect as it is. Try the citizen.
108934,1958482,2,arinsa,08/06/2022,"Beautiful beach with great beach bars. Sanitary facilities getting old, but very clean. Overall, the staff is very friendly and tried hard. We had no problem with a 7.50m camper. Unfortunately, the place is very small and the plots are very narrow, so you have zero privacy. A certain volume in the evenings due to the bar and barbecue area. Washing machines only with cold water :("
108934,1903546,5,Fraruocco,20/05/2022,"We were going to stay two days in the end, we even changed the boat and we stayed a week...and more than I had left. Super friendly campsite with a relaxed atmosphere. We will be back"

Next door there is a great restaurant which offers very generous and very good dishes, adorable French owners and full of good advice to discover the island :)"
108934,1665764,5,karmamavan,28/10/2021,In Ibiza you don't have much choice with a mobile home (> 6m). Three campsites and all very expensive. This one is the cheapest but also the best. Hot showers without restriction. Near a beautiful beach. Next to a supermarket where you can also order sandwiches. Next to a pizzeria where you can pick up homemade pizzas and eat them on the beach. Friendly staff. Very neat. Not for the luxury camper.

108935,2123935,2,brasilandes,26/07/2022,The reason for the 2 stars is because unfortunately they do not accept dogs. That's because others screwed it up. It is a beautiful campsite and recommended for people who do not have a dog. I've only been there to discharge and fill water. Nice staff €14 euros for water and discharge. It is the only place on the island where you can discharge gray water and black water.

There is a worker from the campsite who helps you with the operations. He manages the hose to prevent anyone from putting it in the sewage cassette. Both black and gray waters go to the same drain. It is not ideal, but at least we have a place to go to perform the service."

The good: natural environment among pine trees, shade, spacious plots and a very good location on the island for touring. Very calm. The bad: too quiet, there was practically no one and the camping atmosphere is missed. The bathrooms, two modules, one renovated and the other one was released by the Phoenicians when they arrived on the island (old and broken)."

108957,2677961,4,momoHenri,17/04/2023,"Parking extremely well located for visiting Porto. For your visit, if you go up the street which turns to the left when leaving the car park, you avoid a lot of fatigue because you cross the river by the metal bridge (magnificent view) and arrive directly at the top of the city and you You can visit quietly downhill which will be much less tiring because Porto is very steep but is a very beautiful city!"
108957,2675568,3,salamamcvan,16/04/2023,Safe parking in good location but leaving the parking almost impossible. Street super narrow and it was full of parked cars. Couldn’t turn the last curve without touching the wall or parked car.

The parking lot was still quite empty and we had to wriggle in all kinds of corners to get on and off. When driving away from the car park, you only have a few centimeters left to take the bends in the small streets due to wrong parkers. If these are really bad, you're stuck."
108957,2594629,5,currini,01/03/2023,the best car park to visit Porto. It has some sites reserved for large motorhomes. it is flat and safe and the staff is incredibly friendly. We have seen motorhomes of more than 7 meters without problem. Five minutes from the center of Porto.

I recommend driving the one-way street against the direction of travel, it is about 100m, clearly visible and little traffic. You save yourself the drive through the narrow streets."

We spent relatively quiet nights. Try the fairly new WOW close by where you'll find a dozen good restaurants (we chose Golden Catch and Root&Wine and could order from both menus which was fantastic). Also, the cork museum is impressive."

very good place to discover Porto"
108957,2462227,3,Mathieufardel,25/10/2022,"Positive point is that the car park is guarded, possibility of shower for 2€. But it is small, not easy to maneuver with a vehicle over 8m."

108957,2434474,5,chickenhead,10/10/2022,"Parking Dantas. If you want to visit Porto in a motorhome this is the best way. Yes, it’s a little bit tight to get larger vehicles in but the parking attendant is very helpful. We managed on a Sunday lunchtime in October in our 7.5m. Within 5 minutes walk you are in the centre of the old town to enjoy. Felt very safe to leave the van as guarded 24h. Port everywhere you look! Definitely recommend."
108957,2428847,5,MiguelGarrobo,07/10/2022,"Great! We arrived on the eve of a bank holiday and it was quite crowded. He told us that our van was too big (almost 7 meters) but after a while we were able to park in a spot temporarily. The next day we moved it. It can be a bit difficult to park but with the directions we were given, it was no problem. Highly recommended and very safe site. Thank you very much Manuel and company!"

We didn't want to spend the night but some did, it's not a beautiful place but the neighborhood seems quiet. We left the van for a good part of the day and paid €11.30. The person present helped us park and then get the van out. Too narrow for motorhomes."
108957,2360306,5,lauriefeels,11/09/2022,"Very friendly and helpful staff, 24 hour surveillance by security staff and dog. Very very safe. Perfect location, less than 10 minutes walk to the river, Luis bridge and the old town. Very clean toilets and even showers for 2€. We had a quiet night and a relaxed stay. Not suitable for large motorhomes, the one-way street will be narrow!"

We have spent two nights for 35 euros in this with total security, Wc, showers and very central. Best parking without a doubt to visit the city and sleep."

108957,2290303,4,alemodena,23/08/2022,"For those who have a Van max 6.36m TOP parking to visit the city center without taking any means! Quiet (except for the seagulls but you get used to it ..), very supervised. You have to do a bit of maneuvering even on the way out but the staff are very good at guiding everyone both in and out. Crowded since parking is also for cars. It is an excellent compromise for those who want to visit the city comfortably. We did it two nights."
108957,2285970,5,JannaK,22/08/2022,"Parked here during the day. Arrived at 10:30 and had to wait for a seat to open up. The parking lot is really very narrow, but manageable with a few maneuvers (Mercedes Sprinter, 6m). Feels very safe, very nice parking attendants to help you. Platz is also very well located and you can walk to the old town in 15 minutes."

108957,2270068,2,DameJulie,19/08/2022,When we arrived there was no more room and the manager told us to leave without giving us any further information. We climbed the big climb with our 7.50m CC. The streets are very narrow. We were blocked. Neighbors helped. Please note: you cannot turn around. When you leave the car park you have to take directly on the right and ABOVE ALL take the climb.
108957,2258197,5,xTina,17/08/2022,"Fairly secure site, two very attentive security guards who direct you at all times and are aware of any movement of vehicles. Bath and shower service. We stayed for approximately 26 hours and it cost us €17 with something. We were in a 6.80m camper. Highly recommended, view the streets first and see if there is room, it is not very big."
108957,2248072,5,Fiskk,16/08/2022,"Very central parking, we slept in our smal van, probably hard for huge vehicles, but very friendly staff with 24hour watch.
Helps with guiding during parking and leaving through the really small lot.
Would use again!"
108957,2238923,4,zichi77,14/08/2022,Convenient parking for visiting the city. Not very easy to reach but with a 6.30 am camper we did it. I think it's the maximum length tolerated. We slept peacefully one night only with the sound of the seagulls! Very kind valet.
108957,2236202,2,asaizferri,14/08/2022,"It was full but looked like a nice very very small parking lot. ATENTION: When you get out of the parking lot, do not continue the road uphill or you won't be able to get out to the main street. Very very narrow streets and tight curves."
108957,2229304,5,donillo,13/08/2022,"Great place to stay in Porto. But the parking lot is narrow and the parking is like at a marshalling yard. But the staff helps with parking and always finds a spot. Toilet is included, you can shower for 2 euros. Guarded 24 hours so very secure and only 5 minutes from the highlights of Porto. Only suitable for campervans and small mobile homes."
108957,2222688,4,lauragbs,12/08/2022,"Only fairly safe parking we found in Porto. well supervised, the owner makes rounds at night. Please note that the road out of the car park is very narrow and downhill. We have an L2H2 crafter and it was just fine."

108957,2204067,1,jopaco79,09/08/2022,This parking lot is for cars and small vans. For motorhomes of more than 6.50m it is hell both to enter and to leave and wander around to get to the main street. High chance of scratching or hitting mirrors with AC

108957,2192908,4,MatteoRanalli,07/08/2022,"In my opinion the parking is not suitable even for 6m vans. They enter it, but with a lot of effort and annoying others. Apart from that, as a location it is very good for visiting the long river of Villanova de Gaia and the historical song of Porto. The showers work and the staff are very helpful. Quiet and peaceful night, shade in the morning, slightly sloping."

108957,2161209,5,cleomarta,02/08/2022,"We have spent the first night without problems, the only place where we have felt safe. The price is €17.5 a day, but it's worth it, it has a free bathroom that is quite clean and you can take a shower for €2. After other more insecure experiences and with fear of leaving our van because of the comments on other sites, without a doubt this is the best place, although a little noisy at night."

We arrived here at half past 11 in the evening (Thursday) and it was completely full, we should then drive in & wait until something was free & then move... absolute catastrophe.

To leave the street, the turn of the GPS impossible, badly parked cars and if you continue straight ahead you get stuck. I drive a GV fiat ducato and I have sweated a lot not to scratch the van. (We even received applause from the people when we left intact) If you go, it's better that someone cuts off your traffic to go in the opposite direction from where you entered the parking lot."
108957,2039924,3,NorbertdeJager,05/07/2022,"Small parking lot and only suitable for motorhomes up to 6 meters. We couldn't park with our 7.2 meter alcove camper. It was a drama to get through the narrow streets, partly because of all the parked cars."

And at 6:30 p.m. there was even more room than in the morning
108957,1985835,5,ivanhoegv,17/06/2022,"We went by van and everything was great, the security guard was very attentive, there is 24-hour security, we arrived at 2:00 p.m. and there was room, I remember before going to sleep that there were still free places. 24 hours €17.50, we slept right there, it even has bathrooms and offers you a shower for a 24-hour stay, I felt very safe."
108957,1967667,4,ConnieLiam,11/06/2022,"We stayed here for the night, €17.50 for 24 hours. We made use of the showers and toilet facilities, you just need to ask the guards there. Felt safe and secure, but extremely tight car park, although the guards will help you (with language barrier, which is fun). We have a 6M van."
108957,1967414,5,HeuvisTour,11/06/2022,"Great parking lot! We only drove into town for a few hours, had very good parking in the lot (7m motorhome) and then walked into town. Although the parking lot is quite small, it wasn't a problem as the super dedicated and friendly parking lot attendant showed you around. We had no security concerns due to the surveillance!"
108957,1961219,5,MenOfNorthCountry,09/06/2022,"Great parking lot close to the city centre. 24 hours security, went in with a 7m RV, has toilets and even shower if you ask the owner. Staff was super nice and helpful."

108957,1933615,4,Steffi.und.Tobi,31/05/2022,"Parking guarded day and night, €17.50 for 24 hours. A bit cramped, but you will be instructed. You have to ask about the showers, they are in a residential building. The car park is NOT SUITABLE for RVs or campers with long wheelbases, the exit into the small road uphill with a sharp, narrow right turn is almost impossible and only possible with repeated maneuvering and experienced drivers."
108957,1926087,4,meitocamping,28/05/2022,"Good location to visit Porto crossing the bridge of D. Luis I and spend the night. Bridge under construction, only accessible to pedestrians. Detour via Pont do Infante. €17.50 for 24 hours."

108957,1903648,5,pinfly,21/05/2022,"Ideal to visit the center, the very nice and attentive guard. The place has showers (we really appreciated that) and they have clean water to refill. The only inconvenience to keep in mind to leave the area is that if you go with a van there is a point that you will have to maneuver. We had to go backwards."
108957,1894472,5,Vaculici,16/05/2022,A great place to start a basic sightseeing tour. Great caretaker.
108957,1890566,5,tank22,15/05/2022,"Super parking lot, right in the center and you have a very good feeling leaving the van there. Toilets are also very clean. In any case, you're happy to pay the price."
108957,1883173,4,luupucipiapa,11/05/2022,Parking very well located. Paid but cheap. Good attention. The only drawback was that you couldn't pay by card or with large bills.
108957,1883161,5,Frida23.5.2020,11/05/2022,Super centrally located. We were there with a 6 m camper. And it fit easily. We were greeted warmly and even get a parking aid. The toilet is super clean. Addendum... Departure for large vehicles through the narrow streets is very difficult.
108957,1860585,5,Mart38100,30/04/2022,"You can't do better for parking in town. Attention not many places, we were in April. Perfect location, 10 minutes from the quays of Gaia in front of Porto. Not expensive for the place. Very well kept. We will help you to park, be sure!"
108957,1848213,5,Jorgenet,23/04/2022,"Perfect place to visit Porto. The street is very quiet and with hardly any noise at night. And 5 minutes from the bridge. Of course, you have to go early because there are few places."
108957,1847939,5,Leonhymer,23/04/2022,"It's perfect for visiting Porto! On the other hand, not for very large vehicles, although the parking managers do their best to park you. There are toilets and even a shower, but we didn't use the latter. We didn't spend the night."
108957,1844251,3,Volkeryuma,21/04/2022,The square is very central to visit Porto. A few minutes to the bridge over the Douro and downtown. Only something for smaller campers. You are dependent on instruction on arrival/departure from the very helpful staff. Shower/toilet are available. Only the central location justifies the €17.50 to be paid. No recommendation for longer stays unless you are a sardine.
108957,1840462,5,jaquedomadia,20/04/2022,"An excelent place. we stayed for 2 nights.
next to the river, its possible to visit a lot of turíst places just walking.
its a lite bit narrow for motorhomes with more than 6m.
secure place.
faboulous, with service.
Rui and Manoel are thoughtful."
108957,1834321,5,nomaysuave,18/04/2022,"Perfect for sleeping next to the center. It is guarded 24 hours, the managers are super friendly, it is well priced, it has to load and unload water and bathrooms. We went on a Saturday during Easter when Porto was full and we found a place. I even saw a motorhome parked, but it is better for Camper. When leaving the car park, turn into the back street because the one that continues straight ahead is very narrow."
108957,1832204,3,merlo93,17/04/2022,"Super central, few places. Full on a weekend and hard to navigate the narrow streets."
108957,1821314,5,vicisvan,14/04/2022,"5 Stars!!!! Not because of the look, classic parking lot flair. 5 stars for location, staff, security. The men even walk across the parking lot at night or drive cars out if the owners can't make it. Anything over sprinter size could become a problem. Toilet directly at the barrier, cold shower next door. I also saw a washing machine here"
108957,1818726,5,WhatTheFred,13/04/2022,Terrific. Almost in the middle of the city! Guarded and super friendly. It is also possible to stay overnight (€17.5) and there is a super clean toilet.
108957,1818146,4,Leoniemichelle,13/04/2022,"Safe and guarded place. Perfect for a day in Porto. We even took a shower for free. When driving out, it gets a bit narrow at the end of the street and you have to manoeuvre. For vehicles over 7m this could be a problem. Very nice parking attendant. We didn't stay here."
108957,1817842,5,FernanAR,12/04/2022,"It is one of the few areas in Porto. It is a small area, but I dared to go with a 7m motorhome, looking for safety for my little ones. There are guards (very friendly) throughout the day, including the night and there are services, although I did not need them. In order to get out, he had to remove the barriers, since the maneuver is somewhat difficult but it can be accessed well. Very happy to visit and tourism in Porto"
108957,1814104,4,nl27,10/04/2022,"Great location for visiting Porto. Clean toilets. 24 hour care. If you request a shower, they direct you to a shower in an adjoining building, free of charge."

108957,1806769,4,erikon,05/04/2022,We were there for 3 nights and have visited the city and its surroundings with peace of mind. The operator was very helpful and gave instructions during the difficult manoeuvres. The camper should not be longer than 6.50 m. Would park there again. Close to the Douro river. Origada!
108957,1799858,5,bluegibson96,29/03/2022,Great parking with toilets we stayed here one night very secure and safe. We were even able to have a hot shower too!

The guards are very attentive and help in any way possible. Reasonable price for the area, €15 for 24 hours. Very calm. Without services, but perfect to visit the city and sleep."
108957,1792690,5,coritzundmora,23/03/2022,"Very nice parking attendants and the price for one night is really reasonable, you are in the middle of the city and it is relatively quiet."

108957,1765628,5,TalesOfMarola,25/02/2022,"Best spot to park in Porto (by far). Nice parking within walking distance from the center and very near to the port wine area with a lot of nice restaurants and bars. For €15,- /24h you don’t only get secure parking with surveillance, but there’s also a clean toilet and if you ask, even a nice, hot and clean shower. The owner is an amazing guy. Highly recommended!"
108957,1758690,5,octopus015,17/02/2022,"Parking super well placed to visit Porto and taste wine in the cellars. But also and above all: the car park is monitored, by asking reception, access to the showers. Water available. Only downside: you have to come out by the small alley (~ 50m) by which you arrive which is one way... so you end up driving in the wrong direction. It is done but the locals are not tolerant."
108957,1752331,5,palnoch,10/02/2022,"Excellent spot. The best I’ve had in a city. 6m long van fits with ease. It had ample sunlight for solar in the middle. Manuel is a legend. 2 min walk from a beautiful park overlooking the whole city and easy access to the center. Secure area with cameras. Shower, water, even electric if you ask. Enjoy!"
108957,1751527,5,UU44,09/02/2022,"Perfect spot by the bridge for sightseeing and overnight stay. Manuel has everything under control, gives us a warm welcome and shows us where to park and how to park. toilet on site. Manuel has the key for the shower. will be back for sure."
108957,1751284,5,Topdakkie,09/02/2022,"Great location, just a short walk to the city center. There is a clean toilet on the parking lot. Manuel is very helpful and even lets you use the showers in the building across the street. To leave you need to drive about 50 meters against traffic (same way as you came in) otherwise the road gets too narrow."
108957,1742120,5,4Vanderlust,27/01/2022,"Perfect ! We left our van here for the day and paid €10. The very nice guard, helped us park and we were even able to take a shower in the outbuildings located next to the parking lot without paying anything more!!"
108957,1741838,5,GiottiAlmeria,26/01/2022,"Perfect place, we've been alone for two nights, I don't understand why there weren't more people here, it's a great place to visit Porto, very close to the Luis I bridge, the wineries, the river... Total security, Manuel has it all controlled, a very nice guy and worried at all times that we were fine. In addition, a very quiet night, without noise, what more could you ask for? Thank you Manuel."

108957,1715125,5,AlejandraD,24/12/2021,"Perfect for 6.5 meter AC. They have a mini-room with a shower (we don't use it). Emanuele is great, they helped us indicating to enter, park and to exit! Important for AC: you have to go out on the same street they entered, even if it is in the opposite direction, there is no problem (all the neighbors must be that they know the owners and they respected us while we went in the opposite direction."
108957,1713800,3,DutchDrifters,21/12/2021,"Great place to stand. Within walking distance, via the bridge, to the city. NB! Go back how you got there! Getting there was doable with our 7.5m long (and 3.3m high) camper but leaving was a disaster. The road we were led into became narrower and narrower. At the end of the road we couldn't do anything but damage a stone wall, it just didn't fit."
108957,1708469,5,inmadubita,11/12/2021,"Fully recommended place. For € 15 a day (24 hours) you have the camper guarded and safe. Near the center across the Luis bridge. They have free toilets and showers. Very friendly and helpful staff. Manuele helped us change a wheel and everything, he is very nice and friendly, thanks for everything! It is the best place for Porto. Remember to bring cash because they do not have a card."

108957,1699866,5,Hansen.Danmark,29/11/2021,Fantastic good service and great helpfulness from the staff. Secure parking. Nice clean toilet conditions. We entered the square nicely with an 8 meter wagon. Drove out of the square towards one-way without any problems. 50 meters to great views. 3-400 meters to tourist center. We would love to come again.
108957,1696929,5,NoeEssacud,24/11/2021,"Parked 48 hours here, we preferred to play it safe rather than economy, for 15 euros for 24 hours the parking is impeccable, well-frequented area, guarded parking, no complaints, after spending a night at 10 euros in the parking lot of the station, the extra 5 euros are really worth investing"
108957,1696053,5,Leo601,22/11/2021,"Super central and very good guide! 100% recommend! ☺️ We were allowed to simply drive back the one-way street with our 7.40m mobile home, so everything was super uncomplicated!"

There's security 24h and the personal are very gently.

The entrance is a little difficult for larger vans, but the guards show you how to do it. In general, they are super nice and helpful there, especially the guard Manuel helps where he can. We took a shower there and were even able to get rid of our gray water (canisters). Definitely recommendable!"

According to the manager of the parking it would be possible to spend the night there (around 15 euros for a 24 hours stay).

108957,888898,5,aniawozniak,22/07/2020,"Very good parking spot. We got there with our Fiat Ducato, which is 5.41m long, without bigger troubles. Plenty of spaces, toilet available. The guard was there the whole time, so we weren’t worried that someone is gonna rob us, as it apparently happens quite often in Porto. We paid 15 euro for nearly 24h. We slept in our van on this parking lot and it was really ok, not noisy, nobody was bothering us. Very close to the city center. Payment only in cash, like in most of the places in Portugal. Recommendable!"
108957,873960,3,elysium3,16/07/2020,"Really not for small builds. The road is one way and the return to the main road is more than narrow. we narrowly passed with our 2m30 wide, brushing against the walls"
108957,859998,3,XorruVan,11/07/2020,"We have spent one night and all day in Porto. No problem, 15 euros almost 24 hours. At night until 1 in the morning you could hear seagulls and some noise but the parking situation is worth it. Safe, quiet and 5 min walk from the old town. The exit from the car park is through narrow streets, we are going with a short ducato and there is a very tight curve at the exit in which we have had to maneuver a lot. Important!! Currently there is a work in the back of the parking lot and during the week they work from 8:00."
108957,767806,5,myslien,12/01/2020,I would definitely recommend this spot. We stayed here over night in our campervan without any problems. We felt super safe and the workers were very helpful and friendly. 15 euros for almost 24 hours.
108957,752410,1,gelorsv3,10/12/2019,"Because of my parking experience, nothing advisable, the exit of the parking lot is very cumbersome since you have to cross alleys, it is always quite full so it is not convenient. I recommend the parking lot that is next to the train station a little higher up in Via Misericordia without problems of height, guarded and close to walk to the center of Porto"
108957,728301,5,thomas4203,23/10/2019,Great place to park and sleep a night in Porto safe. Guardian super nice and toilet available. Quiet enough for parking in the city center at night
108957,686993,3,astricile,12/09/2019,"Very safe place, being 24/7 watched, you can safely keave your car here. Sleeping is no problem, the guys are very nice. Toilet is there.
in the night is was very noisy from city traffic, but if you don't care, its the perfect spot - so close to the city centre! for me it was too loud."
108957,679789,5,isasarka1,07/09/2019,"Very nice place to stay if you want to be close to the centre. We went to the town and slept in the parking lot. It’s not a quiet spot but for being so close to the city and having your car watched 24/7 definitely one of the best places around, leaving the car alone didn’t seem like an option to us after reading about all the robberies over the last year. 15€ for 24 h in 2019"
108957,628964,4,Giulis,14/08/2019,Great position really close to the center! 24 hours of control with a little bathroom!we spend just few hours but the guys are really nice!
108957,616811,4,milami,10/08/2019,"Parking very close to the city center, the managers help to park. The alleys to leave are very narrow, it is difficult with a large vehicle."
108957,587818,5,AinaraG,31/07/2019,"We stayed all day yesterday and spent the night. Everything is great! There is a person 24h a day controlling, therefore the perfect security, is silent, a step away from the wineries and also has a bathroom that let you use without problem! 24h for € 15, more than acceptable! Of course, by 10:00 is complete! so it is advisable to go soon!"
108957,550443,3,eny80,12/07/2019,"Parked here as it is secured but very tight access as well the exit road, it has been challenging and scratched my window mirror. But very conveniently located to go in town"
108957,540762,4,eljoliet,06/07/2019,"Secure parking day and night. We left the van for two days and one night with the agreement of the caretaker of parking (which does not see any inconvenience) strong points: security of the carpark with security guard and camera, and access toilet and washbowl clean, a5 minutes of the cellars and Of the bridge don Luis by stairs. Weaknesses: noise from the city and the famous Portuguese gulls ??"

108962,2606530,4,kombiwashere,12/03/2023,"The bad news: like the previous commenter, we were awoken in the early hours by people making fire and playing loud music. The good news: this is probably just isolated to certain weekends and there is another lower spot right next to this one which was away from the party, flat, spacious and tranquil."
108962,1748516,1,inmadubita,05/02/2022,We came to spend the night but it was full of kids making fires and everything. We haven't seen it for sure and we're gone
108962,1702808,5,emilysummers,04/12/2021,"Super quiet spot during december, the drive through the town has a few sharp corners and the turning up to the spot is quite steep, and the road a bit rocky, only recommended for smaller campers and vans. no one bothered us, we stayed two nights and both evenings a couple of friendly locals turned up to walk their dogs."
108962,1187489,4,StepiMach,07/05/2021,We cleaned all the place. Tnx
108962,1144934,4,travelbus,01/03/2021,The driveway is really only for medium-length vans due to the incline. We slept well. Nice and quiet. The police drove past us in the morning. But they weren't interested in us. We would come again. There are barbecue areas. The walkers and locals are all very nice. Everything you need is available in the village.
108962,1097624,3,pamthevan45,18/10/2020,"Great area for a week night and to park for climbing, however can confirm you will get no sleep on a Saturday! We left at 1am"

108962,517619,4,r1a2u3l,16/06/2019,"It is a road with a steep slope at the beginning. There are several plains, there is hardly any shade. It is very quiet, we have had lunch here and only one car goes down the mountain. Something dirty, with beer bottles"
108962,502421,4,Harpon,03/06/2019,"2 car parks one above the other, including a very large (the one above with water tap and barbecues). Very good for the night. Nice clear view."
108962,481679,5,Zdeno,11/05/2019,"We spent friday night here and there was nobody making party. Very nice view. The access is quite steep, but nothing extreme. Maybe just more shadow would be perfect."

108962,452832,1,CVDBCHRISTIAN,12/04/2019,"Very difficult access by narrow narrow streets. ok if you ride in Citroën 2CV. Otherwise it is better to abstain but you do not lose anything because absolutely no place, anything!"
108962,426519,4,jjtuna,03/02/2019,Nice and practical place accessible by truck but can be a bit steep for a big motorhome. You just have to avoid sleeping on the weekend because the young people come to party until 6am in the morning music and they leave all their garbage on the floor. I filled 3 rubbish garbage bags on arrival. Too bad because the place is nice and quiet outside the young without education.
108970,2580242,5,Burgwasser,17/02/2023,"The way up to the castle is unpaved, partly with large depressions. Front-wheel drive vehicles will not make the ramp. From the top you have a fantastic view of nature. The wind can be very strong and also cold."
108970,2515578,1,rodrigo,07/12/2022,"Impossible to access, act only for 4x4 vehicles. The best place to stop is next to the town cemetery."
108970,2427530,4,sherpa25,06/10/2022,"Access not recommended or even impossible for motorhomes but for others, nothing very complicated. This place is not creepy at all. Certainly the castle is a bit austere but with the crows and more, the site is spectacular! 360° view"
108970,1668784,4,Toinette05,30/10/2021,Magnificent and impressive. it's worth it . we got into the van without any problem.

108970,1244659,5,tonerre,09/06/2021,The view is magnificent and worth seeing! But indeed the path is not very simple we went up by car to arrange we had no problems we just have to be careful the path in 3 places is full of holes but largely doable by car nevertheless I advise against it if you have one. van or motorhome ...
108970,1169982,3,VoyagerNCC74656,07/04/2021,The path to the castle is not manageable for front driven long heavy motorhome with low ground clearance. Better park down by the roadside and walk the path to see the (closed) castle and beautiful view towards Sierra Nevada. A rear driven shorter motorhome with good ground clearance could do it. But there are sharp edged rocks all over the track. Mind your tyres!

A gem.

The same goes for the electricity service, it has a high cost, €1/h, in my opinion. There are only 4 sockets for the 8 places."
109010,2494312,5,PatitodeGoma2,13/11/2022,Very quiet area in the town of Cantonigros next to the soccer field. At about 500 m there are several paths for excursions on foot or mountain biking to La Foradada.

As a note to say that in this sector a lot of education is lacking, you cannot turn on your AC and have it bothering the rest for a while, or the same element take the TV out the window and at full volume. We have to think that we are not alone. Thanks to Cantonigrós for hosting us."
109010,2445707,4,SergiAguilar,15/10/2022,"Good area, very quiet and the great town. €5/day with services included, although there is only one post with 4 current points, and the area is 8 AC. At the point furthest from the pole with a 25m extension cord you arrive. The clean water faucet is broken and does not work. Difficult access to the emptying of grays, if your AC is short you will surely scratch on the ground. Very close to the Foradada route access."

109010,2112958,3,Salva2p,23/07/2022,"Very quiet area! The town with bar, bakery, supermarket just 200m. The excursion to the Furadada is about 2km. Goat trail with a significant slope. Now in summer without water in the waterfall but it is worth going down. The site is beautiful. Access €2.5 per person. We will be back in March or April. About the area: Electricity €1, water €1, emptying of grays and blacks. Overnight €5"
109010,1949063,4,PilieIsidro,05/06/2022,"Excellent views, very quiet. You have to be careful when entering and exiting as they can touch the basses. To improve the gray emptying area, it is high and has a risk of touching the lows. You have to pay through the APP."

109010,1749234,2,Celia.ir,06/02/2022,"An ideal place for excursions and mountain routes. There is a butcher's shop with different local sausages and stuffed potatoes to lick your fingers. Now the grade is 2 as access to the area is awful, you leave the bass. Be very careful when leaving, we went out of the ass. Until it is fixed, unfortunately we will not return."

The road to the foradada lasts about 15 'and there is a booth where they charge you € 2.5 / person. The booth closes at 6:30 p.m., at least in March, which is when we were there. Both gray and black water work and there is free drinking water. A marvel."

Therefore, this area is not safe if you want to leave your van or motorhome alone and go visit the center."
109099,2545151,3,gwhorgan,07/01/2023,"Stayed for night before ferry in early December. As noted, a bit noisy, but very convenient for early ferry sailing."

Parking lot became completely full by 11a but cleared up again after 7p. Please give a tip to the nice volunteer parking attendant who watches your vehicle. Note: Fresh water available for the jug at the water fountain along the boardwalk by the waterfront.

109099,1726138,3,Elena-furgo,04/01/2022,"a place that is not really quiet during the day is a car and people fair, since it is a free public parking and just a 5 min walk to the center of Algeciras so nothing quiet, regular night, people doing sports .. walking ... and the surroundings are not very beautiful, right in front of the port."
109099,783677,2,samsimillia,20/02/2020,Quite noisy but great to be so close to the port for the early morning ferry.
109099,779170,3,Amondsen,11/02/2020,"OK for the waiting time to the ferry the next morning. No infrastructure whatsoever, but self-proclaimed parking space guides (""yellow vests"") and jam-packed during the day; it is best to drive straight to the northwest (again to the water), there were already a few WoMos and you are a bit away from the hustle and bustle :-)"
109099,752707,2,lulubarakus,11/12/2019,"Be careful, do not be fooled by people who claim money for parking. Locals confirm, this is a free parking!"

109108,2744619,5,holkyzbrd,12/05/2023,Many places to park. I spoke to a man who checks the parking tickets. We paid 1€ from 13-18.30. enough time to visit the city. Not good for sleeping.
109108,2651064,4,Gerhard_K,08/04/2023,Good location and partly shady. No charge on Saturdays after 2:00 p.m. Sundays completely free. A bit unromantic for an overnight stay...
109108,2433472,2,fujifilm23,09/10/2022,You can only stand here for four hours and it costs a lot.
109108,2146246,4,parkvan2002,30/07/2022,Parking next to the train station and about 20 minutes walk from the historic city center. Plenty of spaces for cars and vans only.
109108,1897537,4,GBO56,18/05/2022,"Single car park. Large but variable filling: yesterday Monday full of places, this morning full at 10 am. Very good for visiting the city, 17 mins walk from the basilica, not expensive. Quiet night. Under a railway bridge but you can hardly hear the trains."

109108,1210777,4,FuXerxes,22/05/2021,"The parking lot is ideal for spending a day in the city and not far from the old town. The area seems safe and the parking ticket is very cheap. We didn't spend the night here. If your vehicle is longer than 6m, it is advisable to continue driving on the road and to park on the side of a road that is rarely used."
109108,787408,2,vanlife1987,27/02/2020,"In general it is a city little prepared for motorhomes. We visited several parkings and we stayed with this one, it was the flattest (the bottom, since it is as divided in two) and relatively close to the center (25 min). You have to arrive early, late or noon, because it is a very busy place. There was no motorhome (and that says a lot), but we were lucky to be able to choose a place since most places are destined for cars. Pass the train over and although we do not sleep badly, it is not to spend more than one night there. We are a little disenchanted with the little ease they put motorhomes in this city."
109108,727188,4,bluemagic,22/10/2019,You can park on 2 sides of the road and one side is much more quiet. Perfect for the weekends. We arrived Saturday afternoon and left Monday morning when the parking lot starts to get full again. Then plenty of space and no one bothers if you use 2 parkinglots. From Saturday 2PM to Monday 10AM it's free of charge. We had 2 quiet nights. Felt safe. 15 minutes walk to centre.
109108,726933,4,Roadtrippers1,21/10/2019,Paid parking spot under roadway....7.5 m motorhome parked there in 2 spots ....bought 2 parking tickets just in case...traffic warden seemed fine with it when we returned 1€ for about 4 hours....needed to watch someone using the ticket machine before i was able to get a ticket out!!
109108,449576,4,maxxl,05/04/2019,The place is huge and close to the old town during the day but full and lying under a bridge on the trains drive. I am the street next to which you can see in the picture driven in and stood further back between park and embankment apart from the trains quiet and secluded right in the center
109110,2748427,4,FamiliaToRo,14/05/2023,Beautiful and very quiet place to spend the night. Some traffic noise due to the proximity to the road but it is ideal. Be careful with the entrance that is not well indicated.

109110,1633255,3,Blancomotion,08/10/2021,"A place for a night, nothing more, nothing less. We were there on a Thursday, it was very quiet, only a few older residents went for a walk. At the weekend there could well be a youth club here. The place is littered with broken glass, so wear sturdy shoes. Tables & benches available & okay. Better to put the car a little off the beaten track. Place is partially illuminated."

The staff that attended us, in the afternoon, was not the most pleasant, however those of the morning shift were totally different. Little more to say about a mid-range campsite with all its virtues and defects."

109204,1125868,5,Bobtail77,30/12/2020,"Beautiful place to sleep, driveway is okay.  The water from the fountain normally flows."
109204,1114261,4,gregos17,11/11/2020,"Be careful with heavy motorhomes the small street to access the parking lot is narrow and very steep, crossings are impossible. indeed a magnificent view once in the parking lot, I spent a quiet night there without any problem, small downside it's a place where the little ladies come to crot their dogs and that's a real shame."
109204,938012,4,miussarai,08/08/2020,"Peaceful place. You can hear the road in the distance, long views. A bit full of excrement on the sides, but otherwise fine."
109204,812028,3,Blue_Marjal,30/05/2020,Nice views. At night several youth cars came to talk. Much powder for my taste.
109204,804939,4,killakalle,21/05/2020,"Came to get water. Fountain was not operational. Nice view, though"
109204,792784,5,Dougie,08/03/2020,"Very steep hill going up to it with only one lane available with cars parked in other, narrowly missed stalling (without ability to restart/hillstart on that incline) as a car descending only last second found the one available space to pull into. If you're light or very powerful engine then no problem for you (if yourself or other car can find a spot to pass in).... Beautiful view and only 1 AC."
109204,785906,5,Focusout,24/02/2020,Lovely spot with great views. Loads of room and adjacent to a very pretty ermita.  There is a footpath from the parking area too.
109204,766584,5,luca.monviso,09/01/2020,"Lovely place with beautiful views of the Gulf of Valencia, quiet in a beautiful town with bars and restaurants. Ideal for hiking, MTB. To come back."
109204,753016,4,footloosetrvler,12/12/2019,"Great spot with an astonishing view. Very quiet. Police just stopped by, took a photo of my ID and number plate and said only for one night."
109204,742938,4,Mizkei,14/11/2019,"Nice quiet parking. Two other vans parked there overnight. Great views, but some rubbish scattered down the hillside. The only noise was some dogbarking. Totally recommendable."
109204,680178,4,birraneta,07/09/2019,Very calm. It was our first night in a van and perfect.
109204,606423,4,herbsofthesun,07/08/2019,"Perfect a night, quiet with a nice view!"
109204,538474,3,Aid_ontheroad,04/07/2019,Underrated little spot. Beautiful views. If you park at the front by the tree you get shade most of the day. Ranger passed by and was fine. We stayed 2 nights with no problems. Only people there is the odd car and dog walkers. Please pick up your rubbish though. Gives us van lifers a bad name. There is a walk down the hill which is nice. Water and bin is at top of the hill to the left on exit.
109204,489151,5,missalhera,21/05/2019,"Really beautiful point of view, I loved watching the sunset and see the city of Valencia below gradually light up. Alas a lot of toilet paper on the floor, please respect the place!"
109204,434523,3,pordini,28/02/2019,"The tap is a bit annoying, water sprays around. But it works."
109214,2714151,5,wanderingbears,01/05/2023,"Safe place to stay overnight was very quiet, and we had a great sleep. Able to park under lights for security. Visit Chimos bar for food and great drinks."
109214,2414250,4,mclouismc4333,30/09/2022,Perfect to rest or spend the night. Wide and comfortable street for maneuvers.
109214,758211,5,amakeda,28/12/2019,Quiet town and several areas to spend the night by van without problems
109214,736293,3,CHABIZGZ,02/11/2019,"It is a wide street, easily accessible, flat and very quiet. A good option to spend the night if you are in the area."
109220,2556621,4,yleniajv,21/01/2023,"Ample gravel parking located on top of the asphalt, you go up a steep ramp but without problems for our car that measures 7m. Quite quiet, although with many roosters crowing from 5 in the morning and some buses that warm up before leaving around 7 in the morning, causing a lot of noise. It is quite close to the market and the center."
109220,2529555,4,MRcampers,27/12/2022,"Quiet site, easily accessible, large and flat in almost the entire area. It is a dirt car park that is just past another tarmac going up a small ramp. We have asked the local people and there is no problem parking and spending the night there (in the ground parking lot, not in the other one)"
109220,750759,5,Leo13,07/12/2019,"Very nice and calm, we drove up on the gravel because it wasn't so bright. Tomorrow the rooster crows."
109220,432470,4,Landy130,23/02/2019,"Market hall open Saturday and Sunday, Sunday also open market, 5 minutes from the parking lot. Place is good for a quiet night."
109221,3138513,1,xiquitin,13/08/2023,"Where the GPS told us to get there, the pass was closed."
109221,3017777,5,Bestia80,25/07/2023,"super nice and quiet, slept wonderfully, were all alone... However, in the lower parking lot. only to recommend"
109221,2518865,4,stefeze,10/12/2022,"The place is very good but we finally left because it was very windy and very cold. It is true that access through the town is narrow, we did it with a VW T5 and that was fine, but I don't think it would happen with a large motorhome."
109221,2486850,5,offroadidler,07/11/2022,"You can easily drive here without a 4x4, but not with vehicles over 2.30 m wide, longer than 7 m and/or with too much overhang behind the rear axle, especially as there is a risk of bottoming out. Van works great. The view is magnificent and it is very quiet at night."
109221,2399516,5,Heidifinition,24/09/2022,"This place was advertised as a 4x4 and the description also states that the driveway is very narrow and steep. If you still think you have to go to such places, you are welcome to do so, but please refrain from the bad reviews because of your bad research. Beautiful place between trees, great view, no prohibition sign regarding parking."
109221,1738704,2,sucapesu,22/01/2022,"The site is amazing, good views of the sea and mountains. there are two picnic tables. I give it 2 stars because getting there is complicated. With a camper there is no problem if you are agile, the road is very, very narrow and steep, it goes through the middle of the town and it is very narrow."
109221,1736432,5,marieremi,18/01/2022,"Great spot with a magnificent view of the sea and the mountains around. No sleeping ban. We stayed two nights and saw no one. In high season there must be a few people I think. The road to get there is narrow. We are with a 4x4 discovery, so rather small. There are walks around."
109221,1486318,1,AESE,20/08/2021,"This is a recreational area, where there are two tables, the hermitage and the mountain paths. The way up it fits a normal car. Camping is prohibited in that area. And the lions ... years ago they left the Aqualeon."
109221,1273726,5,Waheela,24/06/2021,"Very quiet, with great views and many places to spend the night. Roads and narrow streets to get there, if you continue a little further along the road you will save yourself a somewhat difficult stretch of town, with a very sharp curve with a slope."
109221,1104919,5,BarbaraSayer,25/10/2020,"Very cool place with very nice views. It's windy. The link to Maps takes you down a path that is disabled. You have to cross the town. When you arrive in Albiñana, it is advisable to look for the hermitage again and the map redirects you to the correct path. Very narrow road, difficult to get out of the way if you come across another expensive car."
109221,1046465,4,robcapicer,13/09/2020,"Quiet place with good views, there is a flat esplanade 50m before the top where to spend the night. Right at the hermitage you can meet bottle or athletes first thing in the morning. You have to cross the town, it is not indicated and quite narrow not suitable for large motorhomes."
109221,776104,1,PhilippSanchez,04/02/2020,"Access the Google Maps showed was not passable, because destroyed by storm and anyway what for 4x4. It may be possible due to the location, but the alleys are very narrow and sometimes steep that I did not want to risk it with a CaddyMaxi at some point. Drive on to another place nearby that was at least as beautiful and the access easier."
109221,746426,2,sabynaoffroad,24/11/2019,"We were left wanting to arrive ... We could not climb with a large 4x4 because of the steep and narrow streets of the town. There was a lot of pick up parked in the town and it was impossible for us to maneuver on a slope. Warning: we recalculated the GPS route more forward but it was impossible to reach above the mountain because the road was too broken, narrow and near the cliff."
109221,476357,4,koontzsp,05/05/2019,We have spent the night very calm and with much air to be on a peak. There is a corner that fits a van to protect you from the air. There are two stone tables. The climb is by a very narrow road. Very good views and you can listen to the birds in the area.
109221,463110,3,DragonetaBCN,22/04/2019,"Of lions roaring nothing, fortunately, there have been no animals in Aqualeon for a long time ... The place is quiet and with views, but beware, very narrow streets to cross the village and the road to reach the hermitage is also very, very narrow. We only stop to eat, but it seems to be super quiet at night, although very lonely tb"
109221,420023,4,suzzz,04/01/2019,"Very beautiful surroundings Quiet and with views. There is no fountain, but the town is half an hour away on a very cool trail."
109222,2273085,5,Naroa1985,20/08/2022,Just enough to spend the night and space for 2 motorhomes. Quiet place without noise. No services.
109222,1714954,5,arkaitz1981,24/12/2021,With chocks the small unevenness that it has is saved. despite being on the road we have not had a single noise all night.
109235,3205902,1,PlanW,23/08/2023,no place to park. Arrived at 06:15 - it was already occupied - mainly with campers who are staying there. Stick to the rules -.-
109235,3010573,1,Word.by.Fly,23/07/2023,Very confusing and full. Small spaces. We can't park
109235,2908140,2,ellieandwillt,30/06/2023,"We arrived early (before 7.30 on a Friday and it was already full and there are no spaces for long vans like ours - seems they have blocked off the larger spaces in the middle?) Luckily, as we were early, we managed to get a space in a spot on the side of the road just before the tunnel next to hydroelectric plant which is still not far from the start of hikes and very close to funicular. Can only recommend to arrive in this town early especially if you have a big vehicle! Amazing scenery and great hikes are worth it!"
109235,2764717,5,TaijaH,19/05/2023,We parked here for a day while we hiked ruta del cares. Very good and mostly flat parking. It's close enough for the starting point of the hike. For large vehicle this seems to be the best option available. We arrived before 7am and there were only 2 other cars(19/5).
109235,2749067,4,RuthandKoen,14/05/2023,Great parking space for our 6 meter camper. But there are not very many suitable places so get there early.
109235,2706793,3,Weisenbach,29/04/2023,We parked here during the day. You have to be there very early!!!
109235,2503990,4,emax88,23/11/2022,"Small, but allowed for campers during the day in low season, good base for the start of the Ruta del Cares (about 600m). THERE ARE SIGNS IN ALL CORNERS THAT INDICATE THAT YOU CANNOT STAY THE NIGHT, let's avoid behavior that could penalize us all with new prohibitions. Not usable in high season, but from Las Arenas there are shuttles to go up to the trails."
109235,2499251,1,metjimmyoppad,18/11/2022,overnight fines
109235,2332757,3,Katrin.froe,02/09/2022,"Few parking spaces, very crowded. Overnight stay not possible."
109235,2270319,3,AlexMAB,19/08/2022,"Small car park but a good place to start the Cares route, the car parks are small and if you go with an AC you may have space problems, there is a lot of traffic in the car park in the morning."
109235,2260583,4,vikolomoku,18/08/2022,Great for vans or Ac of 6 meters maximum. Quiet night with the sound of the river in the background. Perfect for doing the Cares or Bulnes route.
109235,2154127,3,FrancescMR,01/08/2022,"If you park at the back you won't have any problems, but keep in mind that you can get trapped by the vehicles that park in front and to the sides. The funicular is 100 meters away."
109235,2013836,3,trillonyotero,26/06/2022,very small if you arrive late not ai site
109235,1768688,4,Boch51,28/02/2022,On a Saturday in the end of February there was no spot available so we drove toward the departure of the hike and parked on the side of the road. You better arrive early in morning or come during the week. I can't imagine how complicated it is during summer...
109235,1718120,2,oceeme,28/12/2021,"Fairly crowded and too exposed, plus next to a road junction. No mobile signal."
109235,1593218,1,Yugular,19/09/2021,"They didn't let us in, and we wanted to take the cable car. They told us they were reserved."
109235,1543306,3,lynnelynne,03/09/2021,"We didnt stay here, but we did park here. there were plenty of campervans and it looked to me like their owners were waking up, brushing their teeth in pyjamas etc, so I guess people stay the night though it's not very flat"
109235,1465658,1,LledoJordi,16/08/2021,It is forbidden to park any type of vehicles. Only allowed for residents of Bulnes and the Bus. Everyone parks wherever they can on the shoulder with the risk of receiving a fine.
109235,1138871,3,SmallWorldsPodcast,19/02/2021,"Didn’t park at the entry as the sign says no overnight stays. If you head up the mountain there is a cell tower with a wide pull off for 2 vans. Not perfectly level, but quiet for a night."
109235,1096949,5,PeteAndMel,17/10/2020,"Fantastic. Slept here one night. Arrived late in the evening when most had cleared out. No hassle. Smaller parking spots so again, get there later when most have cleared out to get the best park for your camper"
109235,1039075,5,Nitt,10/09/2020,Few places and not long but a camper or small AC does not stand out too much. You cannot spend the night but we arrived at night and nobody told us anything. Spectacular surrounded by rock and the river.
109235,1010136,5,marcmcfly,28/08/2020,"Perfect spot. Flat and quiet. In theory it's prohibited to park overnight inside a National Park, however, there's a clear sign against caravans and AC, nothing about other vehicles.

It gets crowded very fast, we arrived around 18h. We saw campers parked higher at the side of the road, past the bridge, but I don't think it's allowed. 
The river next to it is a big plus."
109235,923401,2,superfamilyonroad,02/08/2020,Few seats and uncomfortable for AC. We arrived at 8am and we were lucky to find some free space.
109235,918952,2,lobosdemar,01/08/2020,Very small if you go by motorhome. In summer it fills up with cars.
109235,651548,3,katedave,22/08/2019,Ok for vans but not mobilehome. full by 8am in summer. ok to park outside carpark within white lines to the right of the cablecar entrance.
109235,581795,2,clavero76,28/07/2019,"Be careful, it is small and designed for cars. You can get locked up, there are many cars during the day. I parked outside, on the side of the road but not to spend the night. The gutter is uneven. No mobile coverage."
109235,519389,4,Manoito,17/06/2019,"Day parking. It fills up very fast, you have to catch up early. We parked next to the road a little bit higher. After the walk we look for another place to spend the night ..."
109235,427872,5,meditador,09/02/2019,"Very good to spend the day, but there is little room, you have to get up early. You can not spend the night, it's part of the National Park and they fine."
109250,3219301,5,Go_Vegan,26/08/2023,"Nice town, it has several routes and trails. The parking lot is small and in summer it is occupied by people going to the pool. The pool has very good prices, the entrance fee is just over €2 and it is great. Highly recommended"
109250,2753662,3,MikelResa,16/05/2023,"May 16. We have slept alone and peacefully. At 11 pm the bells stop ringing and at 7 am the town and its bells dawn. At 9 o'clock the boys and girls enter the school next door. There is a fountain and trash cans. If you want to visit the castle you must call the town hall phone number. Of course, visits are only on Sundays. Otherwise, a place to sleep peacefully and get up early to go out."
109250,2489374,5,en.liberty,10/11/2022,"flat location, spacious area you can turn around easily, a water tap. allows you to spend a quiet night with a magnificent view of the castle and the church. And to visit this pretty village quietly"
109250,1682444,5,DaviddeTudela,08/11/2021,"Thank you for posting it as there is no parking sign and the site is fine because it is discreet, it has a fountain and sewer to download. Out of nowhere and unintentionally it has everything an area should have."
109251,750681,3,Psan,06/12/2019,Perfect place to spend the night at the fair
109251,426901,4,quilkin,05/02/2019,"This place looked quieter than the other location in Xixona, so I stayed here. No problems, and a better Internet signal as well. I was the only campervan,  early February."
109255,2555654,3,SLMFC,19/01/2023,"Night of January 19/20, 2023. Quiet location, flat land. Great for the night. Large area not far on foot or by bike."

109255,1104917,3,DanMor,25/10/2020,Very remote place. recommended to spend the night if you are en route. so lonely. many places to park

109255,430387,3,samuelino,17/02/2019,"Quiet place to rest a while or spend the night, with picnic areas, children's play area and fountain to catch water."
109256,2820597,3,Tonyrudge,04/06/2023,practical parking near tramline into granada. no facilities & very noisy with young ones at night.
109256,2661377,4,anaintrance,11/04/2023,"We spent the night without problems, in the evening there was some group of kids with music but they left before midnight, the parking lot is huge with few cars during the night. Close to Lidl"
109256,2581874,1,josizo,18/02/2023,"I went because of the positive comments and the truth is that I didn't like it at all. There were suspicious people looking at the motorhomes, I left and found something better very close."
109256,2566291,4,fuerrza84,02/02/2023,"I stayed there for 1 week. Close to transport, good for visiting Grenada. There is a CC area not far away where you can shower. A few vehicle enthusiasts occasionally in the parking lot skid but overall quiet. Please leave the car park clean, there are trash cans available."
109256,2553076,5,Romiw,16/01/2023,"Very large and quiet parking lot, 2 minutes to the tram. 30 minutes by bike to downtown. We stayed 2 nights, gladly again."
109256,2539283,3,SchwabeAufReise,03/01/2023,Space for one night ok - some young people and vehicle testers came by until 24 h - no v+ e possibility
109256,2480532,3,FrederikkePiil,03/11/2022,"It's spacious, but even here in off-season on a Thursday in november, cars kept coming around at night. We were woken up at 03 in the night because of some people talking loudly right behind our car. A lot of parked cars with people still in them - seemed a bit suspicious."
109256,2467010,1,T0605,28/10/2022,"Very bad place to park, they often steal because they know that the cars are alone and the parking lot is not guarded. There is almost always broken glass on the ground. It is the place for parties and drinks for young people. I do not recommend it at all."
109256,2440230,4,Manu88,12/10/2022,"We spent one night, it was a Sunday, there was movement of cars with people who came and had dinner there, some played music, but nothing serious, the thing lasted until 1 or so. Flat sites, without services. Metro stop next door. For the rush it was worth it."
109256,1878821,4,gadou42,09/05/2022,"Super practical! Be careful on Saturday evening it's more music BOUM BOUM But the rest of the time Impeccable, and quiet The tram takes you to the city center in 15 minutes GOOD DEAL FOR VISITING GRENADA"
109256,1776012,1,ce-79,06/03/2022,I do not recommend spending the night there. People meet there to party. I left at midnight! Too noisy !
109256,1766495,4,etienne,26/02/2022,Spent 3 nights with no problems. Ideal for visiting GRENADA by tram 150 meters away. Reminder no service. Very large ideal car park large ccar with trailer
109256,1755231,5,LifeVwVan,13/02/2022,Quiet place to spend the day/night. Next to a tram stop to visit the center of Granada. There is also a supermarket 4 minutes walk away. The civil guard usually passes but there is no problem for the night.
109256,1750854,4,manouete,08/02/2022,"We spent 3 nights and 2 days. very quiet place and tram right next to it. We had the motorbike so it was impossible to say where the tram would take you, but of course certainly to Granada."
109256,1569889,3,Miki1955,11/09/2021,"Be very careful with the Google browser, it directs you to a non-passable area. The best thing is to go directly to the Granada metro station called JUNCARIL. It is a parking lot that belongs to this station."
109256,1500808,4,danialza,23/08/2021,"Good asphalt parking, flat. We arrived at night and there was only one camper, the two vans spent the night alone, at midnight a car rang making a bit of noise but without any problem. It has no bathrooms."
109256,1236480,3,michalk0128,04/06/2021,"Make sure GPS shows the route on the main road, next to the tram stop, not in the field... Not such a silent place, though"
109256,1212640,3,IsaetMehdi,23/05/2021,"Huge flat parking lot but we were there on a Saturday night and it was a mess all night with bands of young people and loud music, rodeo. It all ended around 4 a.m. after the intervention of the local police."
109256,1067160,4,alkebel,24/09/2020,"Asphalt parking, very quiet, we were alone at night. Very good option to visit Granada, it has a metro stop a few meters away that leaves you in the center, and taking into account the parking problem in the city, it is a very good option."
109256,1005376,3,turni,26/08/2020,"Google Maps takes you through the countryside and you can go perfectly by road. People were partying in cars, he smelled regu from dirt from alcohol and pee. In the morning not a shadow. However, we did not sleep badly, just with some noise until 3."
109256,981014,4,adribarbeito,19/08/2020,"Free secure parking without services. It is huge and bright. There was no more AC in the area. While we got to dinner about 40 cars and young people gathered. The truth was they weren't making too much noise, but the Civil Guard evicted them, I imagine by measures. covid."
109256,961477,4,IbantxoG,14/08/2020,"Very quiet, spacious and level site. Close to public transport and 4 young people making a bottle, quite quiet (Thursday night)."
109256,782678,5,DR8,19/02/2020,"Great, very large parking space. Since, at least in my time (February) absolutely safe, it is best to put it farthest away from the road in the back, then you don't notice the morning rush hour and it's totally quiet. The only problem: I went to Maps or Google Maps and was guided through bad terrain and then arrived 75 m away. The parking space is easy to reach from a main road (GR 3417, opposite Calle de Diezma)"

109258,2701869,3,Piolin,27/04/2023,The only thing I want to comment on is that you DO NOT have to follow the directions on Google Maps because it takes you along a mountain path and the last section is very steep for motorhomes. You have to take the NA-7510 Carretera de Larraun.
109258,2673792,5,trilobites,16/04/2023,"Area under construction that still has no services. We didn't spend the night, although it seems like a very quiet area. We only stopped to eat and it was very good since there are several picnic tables set up"

We couldn't park there but the terrain seemed quite sloping. Of course, the views were spectacular. At another time of the year it must be a good point to stop."
109272,2123442,4,Patrali,25/07/2022,"great spot, all good. Beautiful beach (no problem being clothed on the nudist beach, with us it was about 60% of the people who were clothed). But: we were initially three on the site, in the evening the campers (mainly French) came like an invasion. In the end there were 13 pieces!! And there were always some who then had no more space."

109272,1775841,4,SiobhanandJack,06/03/2022,"A good, simple spot that is easy to get to if you're just off the UK-Santander ferry. It was just us and one other van in March so plenty of space. Beautiful views and looked like a nice beach below but we didn't explore due to the rain"

The police have appeared in the middle of the morning saying that this parking lot is not legal and that all of us who were there could be fined. That if we were lucky today and they didn't fine us, they would do it the next day. The car parks marked below are legal."

There is also the possibility of making a bicycle route to the beach of Liencres, very easy and without cars."

109272,860224,5,IraTravelling,11/07/2020,To spend a night is very good if you are looking for good views and a quiet place. That if there are no services. But it is very close to town. You have a beach right there and you can also start the trails from here walking :)

109273,2521859,1,cebramar,14/12/2022,"Away from the town and without internet. They also fine. It is a beautiful place but to visit it changing from the town. Do not spend the night,/camp, they are fined."
109273,413256,4,Gitsky,10/12/2018,We were here on a Sunday and there is a querry on the other side of the road so it might be noisy on weekdays?

109274,2456471,5,beatrice61,22/10/2022,wonderful place to stay and hike...you sleep close to the waterfall..clos and showers were open but not very inviting...but overall a very clean place with no litter
109274,1980994,2,TimoWiegard,16/06/2022,"Showers are either broken or locked. So not usable. The toilets are more of an outhouse. There is almost no network there. The driveway is an impertinence for everything that is larger than a VW bus, since it takes at least half an hour on the serpentines. With a ""campsite"" has little to do. More like 2 parking spaces with a barbecue area, water, benches and an outhouse."
109274,1701487,1,goubi,01/12/2021,Around 7 pm we were admonished by the police to leave because it was forbidden to spend the night there. A pity because it is indeed a beautiful place and beautiful walking area. Parking during the day is not a problem.

We should leave these places cleaner than we found them. Any trash on the ground is an invitation for others to pollute even more."
109274,430854,5,pmc.ld,18/02/2019,"Bivouac for hikers and nature lovers. Departure of hiking. Wilderness camping area. The showers are no longer in working order but the 4 toilets are fully operational, as are the 3 water points (2 taps and a fountain). Water without health guarantee. The silence, the song of the river running along the parking lot, a little piece of paradise."

109276,2575276,5,SimonSarahSumo,12/02/2023,"Lovely spot, super clean toilets with paper, soap and hand towels. Bbq hut also. Magnet for youngsters in cars though in the evenings so we moved to the lower parking area 50m below. Wise move as there were a few lads in cars early evening. Didn't trouble us and soon left. A few cars arrived late but parked up quietly and we never heard them leave. Slept well. Great for dog walks."

109276,1725392,5,SusaUndRalfOnTour,04/01/2022,Perfect place to stand freely. Garbage disposal and water source on site. Great hiking trails right outside the door.
109276,1698869,5,odudua,27/11/2021,"I have been on a Saturday at the beginning of December. There was no one, so in these pechas perfect to make a stop on the way and make a route and see the city."
109276,1237021,4,SusiBen,05/06/2021,"Perfect place to spend the night in the middle of nature. Easy access and spacious parking, ideal for spending the day, going on excursions and eating at its picnic areas."
109276,1209095,5,ktuluu7,21/05/2021,"Very level ground, Thursday afternoon the odd car but at night I stayed alone. There are some streetlights at the beginning of the area so it is not dark. The ground well leveled, containers, water ... a pass of site."
109276,1176083,3,javivinai15,19/04/2021,"Very dark at night, it imposes respect to stay alone, to sleep there."

109276,1144709,3,travel_bnmr,01/03/2021,"Very nice place with some drawbacks. very dusty because of the ground, so every car is a big cloud of dust, young people playing loud music from their car. Cars that pass by and then leave again. lucky for us that there was a curfew, it was super quiet from 2200, so had a great night. If the clock isn't there, I wouldn't recommend this place to sleep, but to visit."
109276,1086775,4,zidaneta,09/10/2020,"We slept on a Thursday night and we had no car or youth problems. Only one group came for less than an hour, quietly and left. There is a fount. Closed services. I can't hear anything"
109276,877057,1,Paco1,18/07/2020,"Friday night. The place is great. After settling in, at night the procession of brains begins at high speed with tuned cars. Open air disco. We had to leave."

109276,787916,5,ibschis,28/02/2020,Lovely place. you wake up in nature and ready to hike into pine woods. really new and tidy. restrooms were closed though
109276,764094,5,speedyhc,04/01/2020,"In the recreational area of Santa Ana, plenty of parking space. We had two great nights. The place is beautiful for walking, running or cycling. The town, 10 'by car is very worthwhile. Walk it and the views from the castle. A 10 site."
109276,755751,5,SergiAlacant,22/12/2019,"Perfect place with lots of space !!. Very quiet. The toilet is always closed, I think it is only for the disabled. You can also park on the benches below the roundabout, where there is more shade. Ahhh, the monastery bells ring all night!"
109276,752103,4,tdwesten,09/12/2019,"Nice spot between the hills. toilets were closed. quiet during the night, during the day some locals are passing by. good area for hiking and running"

109276,718572,5,rafaramirez,11/10/2019,"Lovely site. 100% recommended. Water. Shadows, nature, walking trails ... It is worthwhile to deviate a bit from the route to climb there. We have had a perfect night. The spectacular breakfast in the surroundings. Everything very clean and taken care of."
109276,708013,4,furgoMamadu,29/09/2019,"Very cool, easy access and many mountain routes or promenade, with taps of drinking water, garbage and toilet"
109276,670697,5,Maggyulito,31/08/2019,"Very nice and quiet place to spend the night, below the round parking has more places with shade. Also suitable for large AC."
109276,659007,5,timeless_travelers,25/08/2019,We spent a couple of peaceful nights here alone. There are some beautiful walking routes with great views of the monastery and town of Jumilla. Easy to find shade under the pine trees. Water available from a few fountains in the area and ample bins for rubbish.
109276,636490,5,jokimo,17/08/2019,"Quiet place, easy access by road, water points, picnic areas and the best thing is that camping is allowed. That if closed bathrooms. shadow if you know how to place yourself in the right place. garbage"
109276,546846,5,panchogc76,10/07/2019,"We have had a phenomenal night, sleeping super quiet with the sound of crickets and the view of the stars. In addition, the Civil Guard step to monitor the area during the early morning, so they make you feel very calm."

109276,525427,5,Olganeo,23/06/2019,"We spend the night in van, perfect, quiet and beautiful ??"
109276,485056,4,HenningF,15/05/2019,Wonderfully quiet place. We were here for one night. Toilets were unfortunately closed. The existing source does not provide drinking water.
109276,465980,5,McO75,24/04/2019,"Amazing spot. They finished the parking lot. Great area for hiking. The facilities have been locked, but there's a nice BBQ place."
109276,435549,1,xiberun,02/03/2019,The place is under construction and the small parking lot of the entrance is very sloping. Wait a few months for the end of the development work!
109276,425123,5,KallePef,27/01/2019,Wonderful place for hiking or just relaxing. Spontaneous stop on the passage. We will be back!
109276,420839,3,AqQuaRafting,06/01/2019,"At this moment the parking space is closed for maintenance, only spaces that are not level remain."
109277,2583793,2,Wunderkinder,19/02/2023,"At this point it was not possible to stand. It was full. We have placed ourselves further east-south. The place would certainly be super quiet if it wasn't just gabbering like in our case and the sound was loud all night. I also find the smell here sometimes unbearable, standing on corpses is also unpleasant and there are mountains of rubbish everywhere."
109277,2541238,5,Hailee,04/01/2023,So many road with no purpose. Except for us to have a quiet night. Not the best smell tho.
109277,1879730,3,rvanvugt,09/05/2022,"It does not really matter where in this area you park, the odour of the waste- disposal- side does not depend on your location, but on the wind. The smaller dead- end- roads with their parking bays are the best options. Some areas have declination, some are flat. Garbage allover, quiet, almost no traffic, poor internet- coverage (north worse than south). Obscure area, but fine for 1 or 2 nights."
109277,1184840,3,Choupiie,03/05/2021,"In fact the place is very quiet, with a beautiful view and little waste towards the very end of the car park. However from 9pm it started to have a very strong smell of sulfur / gasoline / ?? . The smell pervades the vehicle and is overwhelming. I think it can be dangerous, we are in the middle of nowhere and yet this smell .."
109277,1181627,3,kasparjuvenalis,29/04/2021,"Interesting place. If you have no problems encountering animal bones and illegally dumped garbage and are interested in deserted places, this is your place. Have fun. Unfortunately, the surrounding area is very uninteresting and the garbage dump in the south of the industrial area gives off an unbearable stench. So park as far north as possible."
109277,769978,3,Camioncar,18/01/2020,"Very very place, even too quiet, it is a huge road that must have been for an industrial area, however the constructions never saw the light of day, it is gigantic, and abandoned, so much so that we have found sheep skeletons I think. The road is perfect full of places to put it, but at night a smell of sulfur appeared, so it may have been right in our time. As the description says it is pure solitudes. It made us a little freaky to stay in a ghost place, we just took a nap and left. I will come back well with a karting to have fun in the huge ghost road or to shoot a zombie movie, it's up to you to make up your mind but you will not risk anything in my opinion"
109294,2537682,4,xamascos,02/01/2023,We stopped on the way home and spent a very quiet night. Part of the car park is level.
109294,2359643,5,mukimurron,10/09/2022,"Incredible silent place and today without wind and starry sky, spectacular views. We slept tonight since we went to eat at the Ezequiel restaurant and with the portion of lamb we could no longer follow the route, incredible prices and very abundant portions, I recommend it."
109294,2042256,5,saraloizaga,06/07/2022,"quite level parking, with very beautiful views, containers, walking to the town takes 1 minute and it has super, etc and best of all the pools that open from 12 to 20 h (July and August) that are super good and that for 2 euros They include a bath all day and then a shower, and on top of that it has a beach bar that has everything, cold drinks, various trinkets and a wide range of ice creams"
109294,889305,4,Limo,22/07/2020,"It is the parking for the municipal swimming pool, € 2 the entrance, with green area and shady forest, there is no problem to park the Motorhome"
109294,534027,4,Angathome,30/06/2019,Free  without barrier or facilities. veryBusy when pool open (12:00 to 20:00) but quietish overnight. Good views of surrounding mountains.
109311,2405678,1,campervancastaways,26/09/2022,"We parked here for just for lunch in the camper after trying for some time to find somewhere else around the lake to park, it was really difficult to get round all the one way systems and find parking for motorhomes, this was ok for the quick stop. No overnight anywhere by the way"
109311,1990452,3,bencrafter,19/06/2022,"We chose to park here as we are over 3.5 ton, 5 min walk to the lake which is very nice! On our return a local reminded us not to stay at night… we are aware of that, I guess they have had problems in the past.."
109311,1328300,2,virgipunki,16/07/2021,"I have not had a problem with the police as they said in other comments, but at about 1.30am several cars with kids have arrived to make a bottle with the music at full blast. I have asked a policeman who I have crossed and he has indicated a parking lot that is higher than the roundabout, he says it is quieter because fewer cars pass. A 10 for the policeman."
109311,1279442,2,jmassana,26/06/2021,You can't spend the night. Pass the municipal police. They indicate that the pk next to the roundabout at 150m is allowed.
109311,664149,2,Clarissa04,28/08/2019,Wide parking. In the morning the police passed by and told us that we could not open the roof of the van because it was considered that we were camping. He did not denounce us and told us that later there was a field where you can spend the night ...
109318,2745664,4,davemucc,13/05/2023,"Quiet in May 2023. Fairly level. Good access to recycling bins and cycle route out of town.

Definitely suggest much more suitable for small vans eg VW transporter/vauxhall vivaro - we are in a 6m Peugeot Boxer with bike carrier and had to park over 3 spaces to avoid obstructing the enterance/exit and being blocked in. It wasn't very busy when we were here, but in summer not for bigger vans."
109318,2252169,4,susisabater,16/08/2022,Very fair for large ACs. We find a place although there was something left out of our citroen jumper and we had a good night. The next day it was filled with cars and we almost couldn't get out. careful with this.
109318,1449701,2,jonatanpardo,13/08/2021,"Mixed parking with cars but small for long ACs. Maybe for campers well. If you are going to do the Via Verde Val del Pas by bike, I recommend going to the AC area of Ontaneda (13km from Puente Viesgo) and doing the route in reverse."
109318,548423,5,Rasjahsk,11/07/2019,"Agree, nice place, more peaceful than other options in town. Just next to river dam where it's lovely to swim. Free parking and nothing indicating illegal to stay overnight. There are water fountains 5 min walk in the centre of the village"
109325,2671783,3,MerelFlorence,15/04/2023,"Simple place to stop and rest, but I wouldn't sleep there. Too much noise. Water still not running."
109325,2584698,1,macflo1508,20/02/2023,Right on the street. Pretty loud. water is not running
109325,2491053,3,zcesty,11/11/2022,"Amazing views, but still the rest area near the busy road, not recommendable for overnight. No more water tap."
109325,1036081,1,noeyjou,09/09/2020,We only stop to stretch our legs. Along the road. It seems insecure.
109325,651958,2,Pls56,22/08/2019,Too noisy road to Andorra. Left in the village but area under construction. Parking at the top of the road near the pool for tonight.
109325,588215,5,Horchatilla,31/07/2019,"Small picnic area, without deviating from the road. We do not spend the night. Fresh and quiet"
109328,2404973,1,rafaydana,26/09/2022,Beware: it is a sloping parking lot without services (there is no water or anything). The area sign photo is a hoax. Town without anything remarkable. I do not recommend.
109328,755710,4,crifred17,22/12/2019,We spent an impeccable night there
109342,2591469,1,Georg_Kettwig,26/02/2023,"It's like Lost Places, huge, very lonely and very dark. Since a car drove through several times (or more) and also stopped, we were suspicious of the area and drove again"
109342,2563154,4,Vanderfolk,29/01/2023,Right next to it is a motocross track. There were a few out there in the morning. The police came by in the evening but didn't say anything. The view of the mountains is really great.
109342,2518795,4,Matthias1208,10/12/2022,"If you like it lonely, dark and absolutely quiet, this is the place for you. The area is really huge and therefore suitable for vehicles of all sizes. We stood a little higher in the back and had a great view. Depending on the strength and direction of the wind, you can smell the landfill."

109342,1776023,4,HerrBerd,07/03/2022,"I spent 3 nights here, as already described, very quiet and safe. You can choose where and how you want to stand. The view of the Serra Nevada is really very nice! And within 1 hour you can be at the top. Is also recommended! Also suitable for larger vehicles. Minor repairs are also possible here. You will not be disturbed.. Perfect."
109342,1764228,4,Carthatobi,23/02/2022,"Absolute solitude and tranquility - not for the faint of heart. If you feel unsafe alone, you should avoid this place. The perfect place to stay for the intrepid and lovers of Lost Places."
109342,1181657,4,kasparjuvenalis,29/04/2021,"Due to the garbage dump in the south of the industrial area, it is better to choose a place in the north."
109342,1136756,5,WigVan,12/02/2021,"Great place. We spent there a night, it was quiet and with a beautiful view. Right now there are some works being done (probably something with the sand) and once an hour there’s a truck coming and going from the area. Kinda creepy apocalyptic vibe though ;)"
109343,2551049,3,canglez,14/01/2023,We were on 1-7-2023. There were other motorhomes and a California. Very calm. The pebble beaches are impressive.
109343,2420242,1,McHeck,03/10/2022,Broken car windows are not a good sign! We therefore preferred to drive further and stayed at one of the campsites nearby. There are several.
109343,2272557,5,LilianeDol,20/08/2022,"Right at the entrance of a natural park, birds, a wild beach and other sandy beaches...an exceptional place for nature lovers! Very accessible even in high season...a dream! And a wonderful beach bar that perfectly bears his name ""Dolce Vita"" A memorable pause, they are very attentive in a picture of the simplicity of paradise!!! I repeat and repeat with constant enthusiasm!"
109343,1801342,3,sieoth,30/03/2022,"Perfect for transit. In the low season no problems despite prohibition signs! Absolutely quiet, but zero service."
109343,438437,5,lochikuelo,10/03/2019,"Quieter impossible, great although there is a sign of forbidden motorhomes, I suppose that in summer they will denounce"
109355,2867801,1,claireichard,18/06/2023,it is the village square... really not suitable for stopping besides a sign prohibits it
109355,2518924,3,teco,11/12/2022,"Very cool place, it's a shame that they don't even allow parking at the moment. Currently December 2022 access is under construction"
109355,2041446,5,furgonetiis,05/07/2022,"quiet, level place, with containers and fountain two minutes walk away"
109355,1804276,1,Farganyares,02/04/2022,"The place is great but they don't let you spend the night. A person from the town hall came to tell us that we could not sleep there, that we had to go to the recreational area for motorhomes (paying, of course)."
109355,1635409,5,Ismael75,09/10/2021,Fantastic place in the middle of the village. a fantastic playground with lots of grass for the little ones to play in and two picnic tables. Flat place to stop. This place needs a lot of respect. The bells ring every quarter and twice an hour.
109355,1604835,5,lauradibiasi,24/09/2021,"Super nice place, we haven't spent the night, but i imagine it would be the perfect spot."
109355,1361288,5,moloco.1,25/07/2021,"Very quiet place, in the middle of the town, the street that arrives directly has been cut off, there is a sign that says it is a pedestrian street, but the parallel street is perfectly accessible. There are swings, 2 picnic tables, shade, we have only been 2 campers and very good"
109355,1217395,3,IreneuTranis,25/05/2021,Right in the middle of town.
109355,1042666,5,guille80s,12/09/2020,"Fantastic. Next to the village. Picnic area with tables and chairs, fountain, trash can and even free toilets. It is usually quite crowded but at the top next to the road there is usually room and there is not much car traffic."
109355,750069,5,LaClosca,05/12/2019,We stopped to eat. The village very well maintained and spectacular views.
109361,2832463,1,Julier100,08/06/2023,"When I arrived there was a customer who fortunately told me that the free washing machine wasn't working and that the other washing machines didn't get the laundry completely clean either. After the dryer, the laundry was probably not dry either, so I drove on."
109361,2594631,5,jermima,01/03/2023,We used this laundromat. The card machine didn’t work but if you download the Washtur app you can pay using PayPal. It also takes euros. Washing and drying take 30 mins each. We used the time to cycle around marina.
109361,2566389,5,FredFlintsone,02/02/2023,"Great location, great parking & great laundromat. With washer & dryer. There are good restaurants and cafés nearby, perfect for bridging the waiting time."
109361,2559364,5,Kutter2,24/01/2023,You can park right in front of the laundromat. Payment by credit card or coins. Excellent!
109361,2553836,5,Topper744,17/01/2023,"It has 3 washing machines and 3 dryers, you can pay with coins and credit card. It has NO coin changer."
109361,2532243,5,AnetteKvale,29/12/2022,You can pay with card or coins.
109361,1879662,1,ederil,09/05/2022,Actual price is 6€ for the washing machine and 2 for the dryer. It takes coins only and there is no way to change bills. Better go elsewhere.
109361,917680,1,abxo,01/08/2020,"1. I was able to park next to the washing place (midweek the gates are open) but security guy was coming immediately asking questions, saying I cannot sleep here and noting my license plate. I said I only want to do laundry. And then he would check on me every 20 minutes even in the washing room looking how my washing is progressing and taking notes in a notebook. It was kind of entertaining how serious he took his job. 2. The clothes that come out of the drier don‘t smell well. They have a muffy smell. I wouldn’t use this washing room again. Also the washing machine has three programs: A B and C. But nowhere it says what they mean. But in general: Staying on the outside parking lot right before the first gates even overnight wasn‘t a problem though. Even though it is located right next to a the entrance security booth it seems they don’t care if you stay there with an AC or campervan. The washing room is a 7 minute walk from there."
109361,848712,1,ChrisT771,04/07/2020,You can no longer drive onto the marina grounds. 500 m before the laundrette is over. They are relentless at the barrier.
109361,791887,5,Unoka,06/03/2020,Best laundromat of all time! Here you are in a port where the boats park in front of the house! Is chore becoming a luxury discovery? For more than correct prices: 4 € wash; 2 € 45 MN of drying
109361,776508,5,jbisa02,05/02/2020,Very clean laundry and parking is very close. It's great for those who want to eat while waiting for the laundry

You have to go down the road or take a short cut to the cemetery, if you want to follow the Jara greenway. In the parking lot there is a bar with a terrace.

109373,1166248,2,nodoyuna,04/04/2021,"Charge clean water with a 1/2-inch threaded tap, okay. Regular gray discharge. For the sewage there is a manhole to the right, on the sidewalk, but it seems that it is blocked, it cannot be used."
109373,1127643,1,Caravanadominguera,03/01/2021,"Simple area without delimiting and badly located for gray discharge, but it does not do its job. It does not have for black in exchange the filling of water is comfortable since it is not a push button. The night is not quiet until the traffic cessation and the closure of the paddle tennis court. Afterwards, you sleep very calmly and it is a better option than the station because it is darker and more desolate."
109373,1091482,3,OshitoWEY,12/10/2020,"Great for emptying gray water, the black water issue is complicated ... Drink water too, because it's a traditional tap, but hey, you can do the trick."
109373,1088690,4,nikita4nai,10/10/2020,"To discharge gray, and load clean water. there is no black to clean. We did not sleep there, we went next to the old halt."
109373,1080490,4,Baptiste8887,03/10/2020,"We drained the gray water with a bucket to drain it into the grid. The neighbor having appreciated our precautions offered us vegetables. The other inhabitants are also warm. Therefore, drain it carefully."
109373,471025,3,dmelones,29/04/2019,"Only gray water and clean water, drainage grid a bit complicated depending on size and location drainage. It does not have for blacks."

Police drove by several times and did not bother us.
Seems to be used by trucks overnight too.
Flat enough for one night."

109395,2415001,3,JohnSteele,01/10/2022,"This place is just a big remote area to park up, good for larger vehicles. Not very picturesque and no lighting. A few dog walkers and close to the main road not enough to keep us awake though. Would recommend as a free area to park up for a night's sleep."

While i was inside the camper eating lunch, someone in daylight managed already to cut my bikes cover with a knife and undo the bikes locks.  When I went out they ran away.  So I can only imagine what would’ve happened if I stayed the night.  Beware!"
109408,2673245,1,Raidertim,15/04/2023,It is the third time that I find vehicles parked in the Camper area. I call the local police and they tell me to call the tow truck directly. The latter hardly knows what I'm talking about. Anyway... good intention of the town hall but pathetic maintenance and care.

The only drawback is that it is really difficult to get there with a motorhome and even less a caravan in tow due to the narrowness of the final road. Picnic areas, walking routes to the river, waterfalls, bathrooms and showers, barbecue area... All great. Please help not to dirty and maintain these places."
109451,2447986,5,JimmyEva,17/10/2022,"Very nice site. Easy to get to, plenty of parking, dirt but flat ground, picnic tables, taps, toilets and showers. We spent one night alone. In the morning (09:00) maintenance personnel came from the area. recommendable"

At the 1st roundabout in Yatova take the 1st exit on the right then after 200m the road splits into 3 branches, follow the C. Fuente del Molino central then follow the navigator! the road is paved and can be traveled without any problem !!"

109451,1786410,5,vinz_the_camper,18/03/2022,"Nice and 'evening/night' a quiet place. around sunset (-7.15 pm) it was very calm and quiet until we left. During the day it can be a bit noisy / busy because of locals who picnic there, they are generally not quiet and sometimes have music playing. Please note: the narrow road is not really suitable for the somewhat large campers (7m)."
109451,1779508,5,FritzFitz,10/03/2022,"A fantastically beautiful place, it's worth going by. Waterfall with a small lake easily accessible, in which you can also take a bath. There are toilets, endless space and fresh water. The approach is not for large campers, as it gets very narrow."
109451,1778401,5,campybrown,09/03/2022,Beautiful peaceful location at natural camping area down a paved narrow track. Level parking places with drinking water and toilet facilities open. Only one other can at the site. We spotted roe deer nearby and would stop here again.
109451,1741275,5,steviethevan,25/01/2022,"Wonderful peaceful location down a narrow track. Water point and toilet available (could not find rubbish bins), showers are locked. Thought this spot would be too good to be true from the reviews but pleasantly surprised!"
109451,1739058,4,losfofus,22/01/2022,"In low season, a very quiet and idyllic place to spend the night surrounded by nature. We were only two motorhomes. Public restrooms are super clean. There is a barbecue area, fountains and garbage containers. To put a downside, the access to get there is narrow and it is not illuminated if you arrive at night."
109451,1731678,5,Yotchii,10/01/2022,"Narrow road but superb quiet location, with toilets, water and barbecue available. Magnificent cave nearby."
109451,1561146,5,DeMirandaAurelie,09/09/2021,"Superb reception area, calm and soothing in the heart of nature. Magnificent waterfall nearby, clean sanitary facilities. Few people in low season. Attention difficult access, we went with a 7m50 motorhome but it is probably the limit"

109451,1430905,4,Enzo332,09/08/2021,"Quiet place, beautiful landscape. WC and access to water on site, showers closed during our visit. Lots of flies which can make some moments unpleasant. Difficult access for large vehicles."
109451,1365042,4,asepla,25/07/2021,"We found the place looking for information on the cave of the pigeons, we did not find anyone charging and many confused it with the cave of the turche where it seems that access is allowed until 9:00 p.m. There are toilets here and we find them quite clean, but be careful on sunny days and Saturday nights with an influx of young people partying."
109451,1315697,2,MarinaRomina,11/07/2021,"Nice and quiet place to spend a couple of days. The river is nearby, the cave is fine, and there is a barbecue area. From here on, everything negative: they demand to pay per person and car when you leave the car in the public parking lot, the showers are closed, the bathrooms are dirty, and all the services you can use whether you pay or not. I will go to the next without paying, because the other is a scam."
109451,1290673,4,kugavan,02/07/2021,We did not arrive but we loved the area. Access to the cave of the pigeons which is very beautiful and you can bathe.
109451,1249984,5,QuisAndres,12/06/2021,"Spectacular place to relax at least during the week. Very close to the cave of the pigeons and several pools where you can bathe. We have not seen a payment signal or found anything on the website as a previous comment said. And neither city hall staff nor forest ranger have told us anything to pay. Even so, if it were something symbolic, it would be worth it to keep it that clean."
109451,1235215,4,dussel,04/06/2021,"ATTENTION: You must pay for the campground at the town hall or via the Yátova website if you want to stay overnight. We didn't see the sign saying so when we arrived in the evening. Spent the night without any issue. Toilets, fireplace, freshwater, picnic benches and rubbish bin available. Don't miss out the Cueva de las Palomas! You can reach the cave via the stairs south-west of the picnic area"
109451,1225239,5,estrubani,29/05/2021,"We have spent two nights very comfortable. We went with an AC of 7.5 m and although the road is narrow we were able to pass, although we had a small memory of a branch of a carob tree that stood out. The area is very good with services, water, barbecue and the Las Palomas cave 2 minutes away. Very quiet at night although during the day on weekends it is very busy."
109451,1172807,5,Damartinezcon,12/04/2021,A very pleasant place to spend the night and with some beautiful routes to do during the day. Highly recommended.

109451,932091,4,Deivy81,05/08/2020,"A very nice and quiet place with services. The road is narrow, we passed with an AC of 7 and a half meters and we passed, just but we passed and it was worth it."
109451,849646,4,dekapax,05/07/2020,"An ideal place to camp only if you go in a Camper or small AC. All services in use, except for barbecues, which are prohibited in summer by fire regulations. The emptying in the toilet in the cave of the pigeons is possible to bathe and make routes"
109451,789526,5,BobbingCar,01/03/2020,"Easy to find by following the GPS until you see signs indicating ""zona acampada"" to follow to the end. We passed with our nasturtium motorhome of 7.50m long and 2.50m wide but there are narrow passages. With a large motorhome only go if you are comfortable with the size of the vehicle. No water on site (maybe this is the time of year) and a ""non-potable water"" sign. Non-functional toilet (no water, always). Trash cans in the middle in a small white building with hatches on top. Barbecues. Really superb cave / waterfall 5 minutes walk away, it's a really beautiful place!"

109451,731599,5,campervitoblue,27/10/2019,"Perfect place to sleep and spend the day! area with barbecue and tables to eat, recommended to make water route"
109451,727650,4,moone,22/10/2019,"The place is hard to find, but beautifully located. We were above the campsite, where there is a lookout that gives you a good view of a massive cave and a stream. Surrounded by olive trees it is really very idyllic and quiet. The actual campsite was unfortunately closed (mid-October 2019)"
109451,725640,5,LazyDreamer,20/10/2019,"Place top! Free, beautiful nature, beautiful walks to do! The cave and the pond with small waterfall right in front of the cave are really worth seeing. Get up before the sun to enjoy it from there, you will not regret;)"
109451,631819,5,MiguelProace,15/08/2019,Very quiet area with enough parking. The access to the car parks is by a paved road but careful for the AC that is narrow. There are services and laundry rooms and an annexed area for camping with a tent. Eye there are mosquitoes.
109451,594126,5,CanKerberus,03/08/2019,"Good place, has toilet, showers, tap .... this secluded and isolated area there is access to a small path with waterfall and pools Be careful with the ground timbers, we have stumbled across the whole family"
109451,439394,4,welikelife,12/03/2019,"Not bad at all, sinks, toilets, garbage cans, barbecues. It's a picnic area. It's not clean at all but the setting is beautiful. It is very quiet. Full of walks, swimming to do. On the other hand we had trouble finding. Follow the shingles of acampada. Attention access is narrow. We went with a7m which is 2.45 wide but I think it's the limit. it's free, we can stay as much as we want."
109462,1738951,2,Eddie12,22/01/2022,No doubt nice for a relaxing break but far too steep to spend the night there.
109462,1279093,5,hansd72,26/06/2021,"Pool open when all the others are closed in June with 30-plus degrees, the pool parking is dirt, and with slopes but has some shadows. on the other side of the park there are services and a paved road. We have not spent the night but we have used the pool and everything is perfect."
109462,870815,4,SIMS6,15/07/2020,Good picnic area ideal for resting and having a bite to eat. Closed toilets must go to those of the Bar and no picnic table is in the shade otherwise top.
109462,600376,1,aude26,05/08/2019,Disappointed we did not stay because the parking is not really a parking 1 place and in addition on super slope ... as it was very late we parked on the old golf practice at the bottom (see the next parking offered by the site) a little weird but great night
109462,427804,5,Zalamealareal,09/02/2019,"Large parking area and services. It is within the population, so you can safely do night. I advise it."
109466,2721349,3,Sjaak91,04/05/2023,"During the day, cars drive along the road. Very quiet at night. Be careful with the threshold when driving in and out, do this very diagonally. We hit the bottom of our bottle holder. Nice spot with a view of the valley (not the lake) and the sea in the distance."
109466,2705665,4,mouch,29/04/2023,"Nice spot despite the very close road, be careful if you go down on the one just below, it's a hassle to go up with a Ducato maxi."
109466,2526189,3,MiguelNs,22/12/2022,A good place to spend a night the dirt floor that can get muddy there are litter bins and the occasional broken bank very little mobile data and a lot of traffic since it is right next to a main road.
109466,2291739,5,JoseIgnacio84,23/08/2022,"Good place. We went down with the nasturtium to the second floor through a little street that is difficult to access (careful, not for heart patients) and it could be better."

If you arrive and there is garbage, pick it up even if it is not yours. There is always some scoundrel, and we will all end up paying for the behavior of some. Don't leave lights on at night. There are animals that can become disoriented."

109538,2509704,5,Rasselbande4x4,30/11/2022,"Fantastic spot right on a very nice beach. Totally calm and relaxed. Few vans. Not recommended for anything over 6m, as the parking spaces are too small. We stood 2 nights with no problems. Garbage cans available on the beach."
109538,2486074,5,Sigkatzu,07/11/2022,"Small place for large motorhome but possible. Quiet night, the police passed several times without stopping. I think in summer it is not recommended. Magnificent cove, sunset and swimming."
109538,2462830,5,okih1906,26/10/2022,Just perfect very good night near the cove
109538,2438162,5,bralonso,11/10/2022,"Excellent car park for overnight stays out of season. Residential/tourist area with few inhabitants. Entrance to a small cove. We have spent several nights, 4-5 vehicles at a time. The people in the area are very friendly. All in all, a good place to stay"
109538,2437670,5,jcfredcampers2A,11/10/2022,"Great off-season parking with a large Cc + trailer. We were able to get into several places when entering the car park because all the places on the beach access side are small and are only made for cars or vans. Neighborhood under construction, so quiet."
109538,2427116,4,ijkimber,06/10/2022,Lovely spot to park and great views. 5 mins to the beach. Just 2 vans at the moment.
109538,2424081,5,joggl123,05/10/2022,"Spent a very quiet night. We were very few campers and could be relatively far ahead. If you take the small path to the left, you can stand above the cliffs and enjoy a great view. The beach is also very nice, further to the left there are fewer stones in the water (bathing shoes). Police came by and gave us a friendly nod. Just like many Spaniards. Recommendation!"
109538,2422251,5,lexietsully,04/10/2022,"Easy to access but for a vehicle of 6m Maximun! The beach is below and we have a nice view above. We're flat, there are garbage cans, it's calm, the police are doing their rounds but say nothing. In short, we recommend :)"

109538,2320940,3,joseanrp18,30/08/2022,The site is quiet and illuminated. We stayed one night with 4 other campers. The only downside is that a car arrived in the middle of the night and played loud music for an hour and woke us up. Once he was gone there was no noise at all.

109538,2277210,3,Yosipa,21/08/2022,Clean and quiet place to spend the night. Near the beach. No services. Some young men from bottles frightened us by leaning out of the windows and turning around.
109538,2234181,5,GanGam1994,14/08/2022,"Very quiet area at the end of a residential neighborhood, perfect for sleeping, we stayed one night and everything was perfect, we slept together about 8/9 more vans. At the entrance of a Preciosa cove, they have a sewer system and it is a bright space. In the cove there are garbage cans. Highly recommended for sleeping, we felt very safe. Paved floor and very easy access."
109538,2193110,4,sly0007,07/08/2022,"nice view, lots of parking spaces, almost empty in the evening when the locals go home. only the shower and a tap were missing. We stayed 2 nights."

109538,2092122,4,Ole132,19/07/2022,"We stayed one night and will stay a second. Parking is only recommended from around 8 p.m., as the beach and the parking lot are well frequented. We stood here overnight with two other campers. Our camper is approx. 6.3 meters long with the bike rack and is easy to park. Unfortunately no toilet. Garbage cans are located on the beach (left side)."

109538,1752568,5,feedyourhead,11/02/2022,Spent a very quiet night here and had the beach to ourselves the next morning. Beautiful paths along the cliffs. No direct sea view from the parking lot.
109538,1722834,5,Massana,02/01/2022,"Very quiet place, you can hear the sea from here but you can't see it. Close access to the beach. the beach is very nice. surfer area. flat parking and you can stay overnight"
109538,1693164,4,raulmati,19/11/2021,Next to a beach that is not of another world but the parking is very comfortable.
109538,1657683,4,bartekvw,23/10/2021,"Parking is at the end of a street in the middle of the residential area, but the few steps to this beautiful beach in a bay make up for it. Even at this time we were standing with several people on this parking lot and still had the feeling that we had the beach to ourselves - great sunset!"
109538,1618384,4,nytomc2,30/09/2021,"Good for a night, and a great cove a few minutes away, it saves the day."
109538,1611614,4,DrakkarVan_T6,27/09/2021,"Quiet place to spend the night. In two nights, only two cars passed. Good views and nice sunset. It has a nearby cove (less than 2 min walk). There is no collection point for clean water or for emptying dirty water nearby, but it is worth the site."
109538,1574642,4,MohiLee,13/09/2021,Quiet space with a beach one minute away. We have had no problems with staying overnight.
109538,1556851,4,SinaGu,07/09/2021,"Nice place, if you are lucky you can see the sea from the van. We slept very peacefully! The only (tiny) drawback: the stand is super nice, but you can't really bathe because the entrance is too rocky."
109538,1517596,5,brk7792,27/08/2021,"We spent a night without problem, the civil guard passed by and they did not tell us anything, ideal just to sleep."

109538,1299771,3,ALYBE,05/07/2021,"Good place of passage, access to a beautiful cove. We stayed 2 nights, Thursday and Friday ... on Thursday, a bottle of teenagers nearby. No police ... in those days."
109538,644296,5,Pola,19/08/2019,"Although it is a parking lot, it has good access to the beach and is very quiet, you can spend the day in La Calita or take a long walk walking to the oil cove. Good site. We do not sleep there but it seems that you can spend the night without problem."
109538,616976,5,camperocai,11/08/2019,I am right now in this parking lot and I have been disturbed by four completely drugged subjects. The nearby urbanization has among its families this kind of teenagers who annoy people to spend the night here. The same in winter there is no one but in summer ... these things happen.
109538,537168,3,savethefreak,03/07/2019,Unless you are a medium/small van and respect the disabled signs for the two larger spaces you will struggle to fit in here. Not suitable for large vans/motorhomes.
109538,516012,5,Pp00oo99ii88,15/06/2019,"We spent a night here on the weekend, we were alone. Beautiful sunset and very nice walk on the beach."

109547,2769455,2,yoyek69,20/05/2023,If not in big need better dont park there. People that help park there can rob Your car - I saw few cars with broken windows. We pay 10€ for a day and nothing happened but it was more like a luck :) sad that police not doing anything about that because place is excellent.
109547,2709203,5,Sylvhanette,30/04/2023,Very well placed. A person helped us place ourselves against a little change. Almost full parking lot. It was a Sunday.
109547,2619971,2,carlottanaldi,22/03/2023,"Excellent position! Dirt parking and THEORETICALly free... As soon as we arrived with the van, two guys signaled us to follow them to be able to park and then they insistently asked us for money (€20 for the day)... When they realized we only had €5, that we gave them, they are gone.."
109547,2016716,3,Sisti,27/06/2022,Dirt parking with some potholes. There were gorillas that helped you park and find a place. We resolved the issue of visiting the Center. No service. Recommended to park during the day according to our experience with a Camper
109547,1810383,1,Bernardin,08/04/2022,completely inaccessible for parking ... not recommended .....
109547,1706677,3,mariestmn,08/12/2021,"Middle of the center!When we parked there a gorilla approached us and helped us park our van. The man pushed around cars there to make space for us, they wanted money but we didn’t have cash so they left us alone. We left the van there over night and when we arrived the next day at night to take the car, the men weren’t there  so we didn’t have to pay. For us everything went good, nothing happened"
109547,1063336,1,coronavaner89,22/09/2020,"Avoid this wasteland !!! Despite having paid the gorillas, they robbed us of the van by breaking a window. Do not leave anything of value inside!"
109547,1002348,1,Mbteam,25/08/2020,"To avoid there is a Band of Romanians who broke my window and stole my things in the afternoon in front of the camera, I was complained, the police did not react !! Be careful, this phenomenon is everywhere in Seville"
109547,764475,4,caravanchen,05/01/2020,"Parking well located, we have been 2 days, it is free but the gorrillas ask at all hours, we give € 1.5 when we get to park, he asks for € 5 !!! I laugh in his face and I no longer give a penny more in the 2 days ... they ask but I have not given and we have not had any problems, next time, I will give them ... thanks. The sand floor is very bumpy, but there are areas where you can find flat."
109547,746793,4,jade6631,24/11/2019,Parking conveniently located We stayed the night and were not disturbed by the noise. The Spanish side street is a cul de sac and there is no passage at night. The parking lot is well lit. - In the morning there were more people because of the tourist location! - José a Roma made us understand that we had to give him money for parking!
109547,740803,4,Fernandogil,09/11/2019,"It is a public parking lot. Those around are parking cars, very typical for Andalusia. They do not work for anyone. In that parking lot you can be as long as you want"
109547,487026,3,Sbrrr,18/05/2019,"Great location to visit the city. Indeed, you have to pay the ""placer"". We arrived at 20h, we must negotiate one or two hours because at 23h, it is not there and the next day is another team that claims their share. We slept in the van and against all odds, it is relatively quiet at night."
109547,474221,3,vanHIGUIER,03/05/2019,"Parking broken but empty from 16h, leaving room to park and offer a night tour. To spend the night we pushed to the dead end behind the military museum without being disturbed despite a lift roof"
109547,450493,1,eaglediego,07/04/2019,"Avoid if possible. The lot is in very bad conditions and any vehicle will touch underneath when entering and driving around. It is attended by unofficial parking attendants which will require few euros every time you go back to your vehicle. The firs who helped us find a spot was happy with €1, then another came and was very pushy to get his share. Was very disappointed at my offer of €2. We didn’t feel safe. There are better places still close to the centre."
109551,2834254,5,AlbaGomGom,08/06/2023,It is not a parking lot as such but it is perfect. It would rather be the icon of the little tree. The bells if you are a good sleeper you don't even know.
109551,2831083,5,FabioRamirez,08/06/2023,"A good night, although yes, the bells ring all night from time to time, it gives you the opportunity to walk the streets at night to have a drink and have a good night, there are picnic tables"
109551,2713486,5,mrtxll1987,01/05/2023,Spectacular place. Very quiet night next to the castle. A visit to the castle/church/museum is highly recommended. The entrance at night a little complicated due to the lack of light but very good during the day. beautiful village
109551,2665855,5,arlachi15,12/04/2023,"An extraordinary view, very quiet and flat. We slept with the roof up, all good. Some hikers passed by in the morning."
109551,2649731,5,vwt6raquelyalex,08/04/2023,"Spectacular site with views of the castle! Very quiet, the only thing is that the bells ring every hour and quarter… I love it!"
109551,1721692,4,surferaa,01/01/2022,"We spent one night there, and very well, very calmly we went to see the parrizal (beceite), but you had to buy tickets in advance, since there is a capacity limitation due to covid. Plan B was to visit the fishing village, but it is a palizon, and it is not worth going to the end. We hiked by bike."
109551,1641874,4,Silcarfer,12/10/2021,"One step away from the old town. If you are a light sleeper I do not recommend it. The church bells ring every hour from 12 at night to 7 in the morning and, from 7 o'clock, every quarter of an hour. For the rest, we slept very quietly and with beautiful views of the castle."
109551,1630592,4,xondi,07/10/2021,"Perfect for escaping from the motorhome area, which is always more crowded and lazy. In one jump you are in the old town. It is a public parking on the outskirts, already bordering the country houses. Be careful, it is the top one, with better views (the best is next to the rose bushes). The one below is indicated only for passenger cars. Several containers going down to the Plaza de la Iglesia. It was the only van."
109551,1584700,5,OlgaJad,16/09/2021,"Very quiet. Totally recommendable. We arrived in the afternoon and there was enough space to appear but in the morning it gets full. No services, but with enough bins."
109551,1568513,3,enriquesendra,11/09/2021,"Good situation to see the town, a week doors of the old town. Gravel and leveled squares, gray and black emptying (the black emptying loses and part remains on the ground), water can be filled, but the tap has little pressure and no thread. You sleep very quietly and the parking lot is practically full."
109551,1489207,3,Jon.Klara,20/08/2021,"Parking next to the castle, very good views at sunset. No services, although there are litter bins. Busy parking, at least in August. It's fine for one night."

109565,1961921,4,levelo,09/06/2022,"Very nice place for an overnight stay. As already described in the comments before, the bells stop ringing at some point. There is even a relatively clean public toilet below one of the viewing platforms on the way to the hotel. Waste disposal in front of the toilet in separate containers possible."
109565,1660772,5,daniel3005,24/10/2021,"Quiet location with walking paths all around. The locality is 2 kms and has a market and restaurants. Church bells do not ring at night. Some movement of cars around because of the hotel, I advise you to look for a place a little away from the main road. I felt pretty safe."
109565,727561,5,duquezavan,22/10/2019,Superb views. Very peaceful night near a church. Bells didn’t ring during the night from 10 pm to 9am. Felt very secure.
109565,435350,3,atos1,02/03/2019,Could be a good place - if not the bells of the church would beat the time a lot. Hotel with restaurant 200m. I went to the reservoir underneath and had a quiet day and the night there.
109571,3221371,3,RosaPatricio,26/08/2023,"We stayed one night in August and the experience wasn't bad. The park was close to the center but had no shadows. The park is safe, clean and peaceful. Castro Daire is worth a visit because it is pure nature."
109571,2314474,3,Burgaillo,28/08/2022,"Parking very far from the town, good for sleeping but nothing more. If you want to see the town, park in the center that is far away and the return is all uphill"

109578,1036900,5,joseab,09/09/2020,It is worth the visit to the town. The parking lot looks very quiet and the view is very pleasant.

Very large place, almost dispersive, quiet, bbq area with water (you need a person to keep the button pushed otherwise the water flow will be blocked), functioning and clean bathrooms but far from the camper parking area which is simply a parking lot flat."

It's a free government run camping.

El Teide park is stunning. This place is perfect to discover the park.

Two things to note:
- Facilities are closed because of Covid
- It gets cold at night, prepare"
109603,783316,1,willvy,20/02/2020,"As a camping area it is very good, but the problem is in the motorhome that if it is greater than seven meters you are playing it at the entrance to the assigned place where they have designated that they will spend the night. The road is very bad. In the picnic area you can pass but not spend the night. If you have a van or a small motorhome ... you decide to go through the fence ..."
109603,765025,5,tamboish,05/01/2020,"Beautiful area, the way down there is a bit scary if your mobile home is bigger but it‘s doable. You have to register first online but it‘s only a few clicks. We spent a really quiet night and could see the milkyway. Best place!"
109603,457235,5,alfvde,17/04/2019,"This is a free camping area called ‘Zona de acampada de Chío’. The motorhome area is pretty far downhill, access road is a bit scary (steep, small dirt road) and we hesitated to even drive it. But was doable, even with our heavy motorhome. And so worth it! Gorgeous, in the woods but still open enough to see stars and let sun through. Super quiet. Water tap only up by the picnic area, so fill the tank before you drive down to the campsite.

109699,1064833,3,troll17,22/09/2020,"Very quiet port to spend the night and visit the town. Good beach, coastal route to the San Adrián hermitage. Do not follow GPS, when you get to the fisherman's house on the main street, turn right and it goes directly to the port. We were 3 vehicles, I asked the owner of a place and he told us that we did not bother."

109699,885249,3,Laveloz,21/07/2020,"Do not park at the end, there is a treatment plant that makes a lot of noise. If there is no place before, wait for the afternoon that cars usually leave. The noise of seagulls perching on the ceiling is inevitable"
109699,869899,4,jafaga,15/07/2020,Parking for all types of vehicles although access is a bit rare. We spend the night although I recommend ear plugs for the buzz of a nearby warehouse. We had no problems with the seagulls but soon after arriving it started to sparkle and did not stop all night.
109699,716778,3,Bluebird76,09/10/2019,"Well for the day, charming little port, we went for a 7km round trip to the Sanctuary of St Adrien. 8 fishing boats came out at 8pm and returned from 2am, after impossible to sleep with the noise of engines, unloading, beeping forklifts when they recoil and around 6am screaming gulls that go recover the remains. So those who slept well are either hearing impaired or lucky that the boats did not come out."

109706,854339,1,tonly,08/07/2020,Park to visit the town or spend the night well. But to use it as a garage for our vehicles... better to look for other options.

There is a tram stop just opposite, €1.50 per ticket (pets with muzzles are allowed) and it leaves you in the city center, to visit La Basílica del Pilar (Preciosa), the town hall, etc… shopping centers (the most I was impressed is that in 'Grancasa' they allow pets? Yes, it is true that in some stores there is a little sign with two links for them to wait there, but they can walk inside the cc??) We will repeat!!"

109758,2591974,3,Leila1879,26/02/2023,"we parked here for 2 nights. good cycle paths into the city. there is only one tap working so has to be shared between fresh water and toilet cleaning, not very hygienic.  we were there on a friday night and there is band practice in the street for a couple of hours in the evening. the waste ground at the back of the athletic ground is good for dog walking and has many rabbits and birds."
109758,2589999,4,RossiSimona,25/02/2023,Very good loading and unloading area. Ample parking also for large vehicles. Cycle path nearby to go downtown. Trams nearby. Great night. Thank you.
109758,2588920,2,NiciundTobi,24/02/2023,"Okay to stay overnight, it's a bit noisy due to trams and cars. The environment is not particularly nice with a dog. The supply & disposal is very medieval."

109758,2581084,4,LaBichadeElchi,17/02/2023,"At 7 pm the area is full, but right next to it there is a lot of parking that fills up little by little. The tram in front. Comfortable. It is next to a sports field. The area is not very pretty."

109758,2576868,5,groentjescamperplezier,13/02/2023,"Great place with free amenities on the outskirts of Zaragoza. We were able to sleep well here for 3 nights and of course visited Zaragoza and we did that with the tram that stops in front of the door, buying a 1.50 ticket on the platform was easy. Also all kinds of shops within walking distance."

109758,2573673,4,itsallaboutthejourney,10/02/2023,"Located directly on a busy street during the day. At night, on the other hand, there is almost no traffic, so it is surprisingly quiet. With the tram stop in front of the door (ticket €1.50) a perfect base to explore Zaragoza"
109758,2572010,4,Relax2000,08/02/2023,"As already aptly described by the previous writers, free parking space with V/E directly on the street. 45 mins walk to the center or by train in about 15 minutes.

109758,2563340,5,WilbyUK,29/01/2023,Nice basic aire. It was quiet and safe with water and emptying facilities. Not that busy in January. There is a Carrefour hypermarket just 5 minutes walk from here. There is also a tram just across the road but we walked to the centre of Zaragoza which took 45 minutes. Lovely cathedral. Yes recommend this aire.
109758,2560358,5,miriamv14,25/01/2023,"Very good place to visit Zaragoza. The quiet night without noise, the only thing you hear is the tram that is right in front, but you can bear it. It also happens very often to be able to visit the center."
109758,2554357,5,titou2609,17/01/2023,"Free area with delimited spaces and operational services, water and garbage. The proximity of the tram and the road did not bother us. Quiet night. Very convenient for visiting the city. Thanks to the municipality."

109758,2546615,4,dalunar,08/01/2023,we have been the bridge of kings. A joy that you have the tram next to you. easy to get to from the highway or motorway. that yes... in summer it would need shadows. A failure that the faucet is a push button... impossibility of connecting a hose
109758,2542677,4,JohnSky,05/01/2023,"Arra camper grande 15 minutes by metro from the centre, but bus stop 1 minute away. Quiet night despite the proximity to the road. Free loading and unloading but the water pump has no ring nut and it is difficult to load."
109758,2541042,5,HermioneH,04/01/2023,Lots of parking - small spots unless lucky to get one of the designated motorhome ones. Quiet night and perfectly level. Tram goes every 5 mins and late into the night. €1.50 each way - pay at the machine and tap when on the tram.
109758,2539416,4,JoanCasas,03/01/2023,"Very well located area, on the outskirts but with the tram stop right in front. Well-marked, paved and flat places. Emptying and filling services. Ideal for visiting Zaragoza."
109758,2537281,4,Nico4298,01/01/2023,We have been here several times. The place is ideal with the tram to visit the city and at the same time remote enough to be quiet. The area fills up very quickly but there is room. Too bad that the services are deteriorating little by little. Yesterday the cleaning valve for the cassette was out of order and the drinking water valve was leaking a lot…
109758,2535784,4,bkb,31/12/2022,Large paved parking lot. Places drawn on the ground. Free water and garbage. A single water point for drinking water and cleaning the cassettes. Tramway to the city center 50m away (€1.40/trip). Sorting bins. Very convenient for visiting Zaragoza and finally not so noisy at night.
109758,2535716,3,joanjo,31/12/2022,"Great area, far from the center, but well connected (10 minutes by tram). The service area is poorly maintained, the last few times we've been there the tap to clean the chemical didn't work, and it's too short for so many motorhomes. A bit of traffic noise, but you sleep well."
109758,2534723,5,AdriR1,30/12/2022,"Good location next to the tram (dogs are allowed) so it has been great for us to be able to use it to visit the center. A tad noisy on the street and by the tram itself (it's not the death of anyone either). No shade (I don't know in summer...). What I don't understand is the people who open the tap of their gray water in the parking space itself, will they confuse it with the emptying space? I don't understand…"
109758,2534547,5,sonluk,30/12/2022,"Huge parking all paved, level, large squares and with an area for all water discharge, very quiet and clean."

109758,2518854,4,AicoGarri,10/12/2022,Spacious and quiet place to park and spend the night. We went on the weekend of the Pilar festivities without knowing it? Great to go to the center because the tram stop is next to it.
109758,2518492,5,alvanee,10/12/2022,"When we arrived there was no space but we parked in a car parking area just behind (next to the football field) like many other ACs, in addition to these places there is another car park right next to it where many ACs and campers also parked. Available filling and emptying of water and potty, although the faucet for washing the potty was broken. Tram right in front. safe and quiet place"
109758,2518170,4,RLJ,10/12/2022,Ideal area to visit Zaragoza. Tram right in front 10 minutes from the center. We stayed one night and there were many motorhomes. Thanks to Zaragoza for this area.
109758,2517820,5,xgoReus,09/12/2022,"Thanks to Zaragoza for this area. We spent two nights there. Very good place to spend the night and see Saragissa with the tram nearby and with good services. We were very much campers and felt very safe. since it was full, the first night we were in the parking lot next door, also with plenty of AC and able to use the services. Zaragoza is well worth a visit."
109758,2517160,4,adrialex,09/12/2022,"Normally very crowded area, it is normal for being very close to Zaragoza with the tram next to it. We were in the apartment next door and it was super good with all the services (except current), many thanks to Zaragoza for having us!!!"
109758,2516882,5,maitec,09/12/2022,"Good place to park and has the tram that takes you to the center in no time. The tramway accepts dogs if they wear a muzzle. In case there is no room in the area, right next to it there is an open field where there are always motorhomes parked."
109758,2514478,4,Nat1984,06/12/2022,"Very well connected to the city center with the tram that is right in front (€1.40/ticket per person). very quiet and as a very positive aspect that I highlight, the presence of the police that passed through the area on several occasions. Many thanks to the Zaragoza City Council"

109758,2510794,4,funacoshi,02/12/2022,Super good! You sleep quietly and with a very good bike lane to the center at 3.5km.
109758,2509833,3,Millaneando,01/12/2022,"The initiative of the city council is appreciated, but a place where you could rest would be better, the rest that begins at 1 in the morning when the tram ends ends at 5:30 in the morning when the tram and traffic starts, the A2 A few hundred meters away, the avenue next to the area and the tram still make it impossible to sleep."
109758,2509446,3,juansunder,30/11/2022,"good initiative, by the town hall, perfect area to visit the city and spend the night, a bit far from the center and sloping squares but in general good"
109758,2507756,4,WanderWebb,28/11/2022,"Great location to visit the city although traffic does start from around 530am, so a little disturbing. Black water tap not working but the fresh water tap is, meaning that some may be using that to rinse - bring bleach!!"
109758,2504101,3,PaulavanS,24/11/2022,"very busy road and unfortunately the water is not working, or it is already closed. Many spacious places. You can reach the center in no time by bike."
109758,2499663,5,ViajandoenTUTU,19/11/2022,"Very good space: wide, flat, paved. Regarding access to the tram that connects you with the entire city and in particular to tourist areas, you must take the trains to Mago de Oz to visit the bridge and the historic center, I recommend you get off at Chimenea station where you will see the cathedral and the old bridge first class Tickets are purchased right there. We loved this car park!"
109758,2498660,5,charliepace5,18/11/2022,"perfect connection with the city center by metro , quite at night"

109758,2497454,5,JuanP14,16/11/2022,"Very good area to spend the night. Tram 100 MTS away that takes you to the city for €1.40, ideal and comfortable. 500 meters from Carrefour. There are many places, but they are always full. It is important to say that the seats are comfortable and flat!"
109758,2491437,5,easygth,11/11/2022,"Convenient place to see the city. Water, supply and disposal are available and the tram runs directly across the street into the city. We spent 2 nights there and it was full. For a free seat, 5 stars!"

The camper area is safe and quiet despite the nearby road, good loading and unloading service. Absolutely recommended for visiting the city."
109758,2485996,4,gyzmo35,07/11/2022,40 minutes walk from this magnificent city. Large area which is completed by the large car park next door where there is more comfort. Too bad there is waste everywhere. Spain is getting dirtier and dirtier. is sad Free services. Thanks to the city.
109758,2485599,3,Tvc,06/11/2022,"Good spot to visit Zaragoza with your bike or with the tram. Nothing more than that however. Very crowded, which makes it more safe than it otherwise would be. You can refill water and clean toilets for free. There is a lot of trash, however, and also quite a lot of noice of traffic."
109758,2484335,5,MayFigarella,05/11/2022,Good place to spend the night
109758,2482972,4,MartinezPL,05/11/2022,"Near the city (the old town 4 km on foot, the tram returns to the parking lot 1.60 €) it fills up in the evening. If you are driving on the way to Madrid or vice versa somewhere, it is worth stopping for a while or a night. Relax, with the windows closed, standing from the pitch (it's next door), you cannot hear the tram."
109758,2477695,5,daniyfany,01/11/2022,"site very well located there are enough spaces, what the motorhome spaces are sometimes occupied by small vans and large motorhomes we are forced to park in small car spaces with the problem that sometimes among colleagues we close without noticing on the other hand the tap of water already deserves a break and put it back"
109758,2469183,5,Angelet56,29/10/2022,"Very good to visit Zaragoza, the tram 50 meters away (€1.40 ticket) they let dogs on (one with a muzzle in the last car). the area is almost always full but there is a lot of room next door that is also full of acs"
109758,2465363,5,PhilippeCorte,27/10/2022,Parking for motorhomes with easy access evacuations. Ideal location for visiting Zaragoza with the tram that passes in front of the car park. Very practical cycle paths to get to the center in 15 minutes. Ideal for a short stopover. The car park is very coveted from the place until 4 p.m. after full.
109758,2460755,3,antipass,24/10/2022,"Unpretentious and quickly full spot, but ok for a transit night and close to all amenities for a quick visit to the city. Satisfying for sure."
109758,2460724,4,castmember,24/10/2022,"City center area so you have to accept the noise that goes with it. However, the night is calm. Stay in October the area is full. Fortunately there is always enough to park a little further along the athletics stadium."
109758,2460518,5,Family-Bruynooghe,24/10/2022,"I would like to apologise on behalf of all Van/Campervan owners. It is a shame. Zaragoza offers a very large car park with free service for which sincere thanks. A car park where the city centre is very accessible. Yet the car park is so dirty. The flower boxes and surrounding greenery is full of rubbish. Never seen this before. So disrespectful. Cleaning up is the job of the users, not the city."
109758,2455903,5,typHAINE04,22/10/2022,"Excellent free location with service, the tram 50 m away is just what you need! Great"

109758,2446835,4,IrisF,16/10/2022,"Functional, clean. City is accessible on foot and by public transport. Large Carrefour very close (on foot or by bike, as the height in the parking lot is limited) At the sports facility you should be able to take a shower for 1.20. Quiet at night, only tram is a bit noisy."

109758,2443270,4,Eliasand,14/10/2022,"The parking lots are very spacious. We stayed two nights during the Pilar week and didn't experience any problems whatsoever.

109758,2436894,4,camposole,11/10/2022,"At the Pilar festivities we find a place to sleep here. The tram passes Just by the side, take it into account for those who are sensitive to noise, although it is not too much."

109758,2424815,1,spetsay,05/10/2022,"No need to try to stop there on October 5, the area is completely saturated, motorhomes parked in the car park with the police making rounds. Avoid at all costs. we could regret that it is not paying with a maximum of 48 hours…"
109758,2423076,4,AndrzejHankiewicz,04/10/2022,"Wonderfully located CP. Easy and quick access to the center. Proximity to Carrefour hypermarket. Full sanitary service. The disadvantage is certainly not enough places, but the solution is a second reserve parking lot at the stadium. Thanks to the authorities who took care of us."

109758,2405227,3,PhilippeS,26/09/2022,Very good for visiting the city and unloading. But you have to like tight CC concentrations...
109758,2404166,5,LaLourenco,26/09/2022,"Fantastic place to stay overnight safe with dozens of campervans parked, place to flush dirty water and toilets, and load clean water, We love being there with our Freedom in Motion"
109758,2402234,3,LeLayChristian,25/09/2022,"Agree with previous comments, we can add that there are shops 5 minutes from the car park including a huge Carrefour supermarket."
109758,2393416,4,danfjr1300,22/09/2022,Suite So 80 ccar that day But still free places in the 3rd zone: access = along the tram and just before the bridge on the right with gravel ground. Tram less than 50 meters for the city center you get off after crossing the water (large bridge)
109758,2393400,4,danfjr1300,22/09/2022,"17 and 18/4/22: following coordinates (N 41° 41' 9'' W 0° 53' 27.2'' are better. You follow a well-signposted path to get there. You arrive at the right entrance with at G location of the service area (drinking water, waste water)."
109758,2385250,5,FranckVAN,19/09/2022,"Indeed, like all previous reviews: the area is shadowless / a bit noisy / very quickly filled. But if it's just to sleep it's perfect because the tram is right in front to go everywhere in Zaragoza. On the other hand, if you prefer to spend your day in the car park rather than visiting … go your way"
109758,2382783,4,trigopina,18/09/2022,"Quite a large area, with many seats, but it fills up. Next door there is another parking area but without services, although with more shade during the day and less light at night. In general, the area is quiet, although there is some noise from cars. And at 8:30-9, there is a movement of cars and people who go to play football in the fields that are next door. In the AC area there is a lack of shade."
109758,2381327,4,dti1985,17/09/2022,"The area as such is fine, fairly level and spacious squares. You can hear a lot of traffic and if you arrive at night there are no free spaces, although on the street that continues you can also park without problems, what's more, I think it's a little less noisy and without so much light. It lacks a bar or cafeteria nearby. On Saturday at 8 in the morning they were already playing soccer in the surrounding fields"
109758,2378148,5,Mairos,16/09/2022,"Large area, with all services available and in good condition. We stop to eat. Right in front there is a tram stop."
109758,2373662,4,LuzAnton,15/09/2022,"Very functional to get to know the city in a very comfortable way. The only drawback is that it seems that there are motorhomes that are parked, unused, taking up space, perhaps by local people. Which considerably reduces the possibility of being able to spend the night there. At night it was always full, there has not been a free place in the 2 nights that we have spent."
109758,2369329,5,Elios59T,14/09/2022,Huge municipal area for free CC with possibility of emptying and filling up with drinking water.

109758,2154060,4,Elisopola,31/07/2022,Convenient free area attached to the tram stop leading to the center which is not far away. Too bad that the tap for flushing the toilet cistern is out of order and many people are using the tap to load drinking water to rinse the toilet cistern. We hope the water will be fixed soon!

109758,2104465,4,magair,21/07/2022,"Perfect access from the highway and very practical to visit the city, having public transport stops right in front of it. Long and wide enough spaces for what it is: a parking area, not a campsite. Congratulations Zaragoza for facilitating our access to your beautiful city."
109758,2101303,5,Howls01,21/07/2022,Parking with services. We use it to spend the night on our route. The road passes right next to it but you can rest well. It was quite full but there were still spaces available. Thank you Zaragoza for this space!

Negative: terrain with a slight slope. There is no shade at all. The water area is poorly designed. you can only fill and empty grays at the same time with long hose."

109758,2008509,4,CristinaMMarias,25/06/2022,"Good area to visit Zaragoza, with very good communication by bus and tram. Like any area within the urban area, very noisy. The pity is that the access of cars to it is not controlled, which prevents motorhomes from parking."
109758,1994547,4,MartinDez,20/06/2022,easy to find parking and service area. near the tram. ideal cycle paths to get to the center in 20 minutes. hypermarket 5 minutes walk. small downside: no shade in the parking lot.

109758,1968453,3,iceman5430,11/06/2022,"This place deserves to exist. Very useful as a parking lot with some minimal services, time to visit the city (by tram or by bike). But to spend the night is something else. It's really just a parking lot, and nothing else. Above all, it lacks a little shade."
109758,1966731,4,laGosi,11/06/2022,"Paved area with many wide spaces and oblique parking on both sides, with a tram and bus stop next door and a carrefour very close to the area for emptying gray water and black water and loading clean water, the cleaning faucet does not work poti, it lacks trees that provide shade."

109758,1938554,5,Sunscheinchen,02/06/2022,"We had a very quiet night. The street and the tram didn't bother us, they almost didn't notice it. The supply and disposal is very easy to handle. Many thanks to the city for providing such places free of charge."
109758,1935788,1,Ginabi,01/06/2022,"Well located place for a city tour. To stay overnight, especially with a small child, it was a disaster. The street noise is not the problem, but the behavior of the others. Mobiles arrive until late at night (3 a.m.), people talk loudly, park around, use the VE during the night and then continue at 5 a.m. Very inconsiderate."
109758,1931672,4,Vandiamo,30/05/2022,"Excellent (except for the road noise) for our 9m motorhome. Lots of parking around too if full. Tram L1 towards Mago de Oz for city centre) easy to use in all languages, €1.40 single (validate on tram). 10min journey to Plaza del Pilar for Cathedral. Runs till midnight returning.

109758,1881871,3,Calimero125,10/05/2022,"Ideal for visiting this pretty city, the proximity of public transport is really practical. On the other hand, it is actually better to bring earplugs for the night, the highway does not really go very far."
109758,1880098,3,kikidu,09/05/2022,"Personally, the parking space was not close enough to the city center to walk (with a dog) for me, otherwise I would have used it. However, it was too crowded and sparse for me, so I preferred to be nicer and looked for a day parking lot the next day to visit Zaragoza."
109758,1878317,5,CANB,08/05/2022,"It is very good, there is a tram stop that takes you to the center. There is also a carrefour 500 meters away. There are for gray and black water and drinking water filling. Many thanks to Zaragoza City Council for this all-free area."
109758,1873859,5,kudson,06/05/2022,"Good for a couple nights, easy to get to the town centre as the metro is just across the road. This spot can be busy but there is also parking in the stadium parking right next to it, but no services there"
109758,1873269,3,cargo,06/05/2022,"Parking CC almost full in early May. Fortunately, it is extended by an empty car park on which to park along without getting in the way, at least at the moment. A tram line on the edge takes you to the city center in 10 minutes for €1.40, ticket machine on the quay. A hyper Carrefour at 500 m, but inaccessible to CC. Surroundings a little dirty, traffic noise."
109758,1870901,5,AlejoBarcelona,05/05/2022,"Very well. Very quiet on a Wednesday in May. We only stayed overnight, we do not use the water services, so I cannot comment. Thanks to the city council of Zaragoza"

We slept very well, without too much noise. There are no taps or toilets but the bars are close to the underpass"

109758,1845404,4,gon943,22/04/2022,"Thanks to the Zaragoza City Council for allowing us to park our vehicles in this well-lit area near services and the metro. In fact, another gray unloading area is missing (the same area allows it, it is long enough for 2 vehicles) it would also be interesting to put the recycling and rest containers together and not so far apart since it forces you to go to 2 different distant sites."

109758,1824905,5,Raulana,15/04/2022,Very good place to spend the night. In a short time I saw the police go by twice. Level ground to put some snag just be careful with the branches of the trees.

There is enough space to walk the dogs in the surroundings (there are rabbits)."

109758,1795514,3,e.nak,26/03/2022,"I have only come to spend the night and I would say that it is a good place although a little noisy (too much movement of cars around). Look just in case another option, it was almost full!"

109758,1790926,4,spoony03,21/03/2022,"lots of motorhomes tonight. the 2 car parks are full. Noisy until midnight because a big mower maintains the lawns of the tram line at night. The rest of the night is quiet. on the other hand, in the morning, the emptying area is taken by storm and you have to be patient. but ultimately, it's a good well-placed area."
109758,1790908,1,justlemien,21/03/2022,"After I have settled in, at 8:00 p.m. cars park behind me, the winds come out of the drums of the bass drums, they form a circle next to the motorhomes and begin to play. No way to enter the tv, even on the phone no way to hear each other. The height impossible to leave because the cars block the CC. Anyway, make water and stuff and then go sleep somewhere else. HELL."

Next to a road so obviously not the most calm place but night was ok. Would recommend if you’re planning on visiting the city."
109758,1787613,4,bkb,19/03/2022,"Free parking near the stadiums, very quickly full. Admittedly a little noisy between road and tram, but so convenient to get to the city center with the tram.

109758,1760040,4,Nuwa,19/02/2022,Ares is big. When we arrived about 9:30 p.m. There were only 4 free places left. Things in favor: it is paved. The wide and flat filling and emptying area. There's water. The light rail that takes you to the center of Zaragoza is crossing the area. Things less in favor a lot of light is in front of the sports center at eight o'clock there are already people training soccer. The distance to Zaragoza is a lot to walk.

Really clean, flat and well maintained. 
We felt safe! Visited the pretty city of Zaragoza 
Its 45 minutes walking but only 15 minutes in tramway (8 stations) to reach the basilica. 
Maybe little bit noisy for some since it's by a large boulevard."
109758,1732537,5,MeteoNRuta,12/01/2022,"Fantastic area with plenty of places and services. Some ""buts"": Anyone who is a light sleeper may be somewhat bothered by the passing of the odd vehicle; You have to use transport or bike to go to the center ... or else a good walk; when we arrived it was almost full (we hope the camper rotation is respected). Otherwise great, thanks guys !!"
109758,1732398,2,Go_Vegan,12/01/2022,"I give it only two stars. good initiative for Zaragoza to put an area, but knowing that it is for sleeping, they are not flat squares, slight costs in the car parks. the rest great"

109758,1731768,3,Rasjahcor,10/01/2022,"It is appreciated that a great city allocates a space for us. Many should take an example. The services work perfectly and since it is any given day during the week there are quite a few AC's and campers. However, the place seems far from idyllic. Close to roads and soccer fields making it quite noisy and crowded. For a night on the road well but nothing more."
109758,1731056,5,Sammy.jun,09/01/2022,A good free city parking space for a maximum of 72 hours. A supply and disposal is available. Unfortunately no electricity.

109758,1730401,5,albertobd,09/01/2022,"Thank you very much Zaragoza, a perfect and free area. The water intakes and perfect emptying. Even though the filling water intake was perfectly separated from the bathroom box cleaning intake, there was a van that cleaned it in the clean water filling outlet. That there are people like that we do not understand, they do not care about everything that is sad."

At 11:30 p.m. we called the local police to complain because the riot was coming so they came after ten minutes and passed in front of them and it did not occur to them to say anything (music, electricity generator, caravans and above all the screams that hit) because the thing got heated and what I predicted the two women came out almost with sticks of them and the unfortunate thing is that we had to endure all this without being able to do anything thanks to that municipal police of Zaragoza that does not know about ordinances or does not want to complicate life. I give a 10 to the city and a 0 to those incompetent policemen for not knowing how to do their job. Thank you very much Zaragoza."

109758,1236405,4,amaiasandua,04/06/2021,"Good place to visit the city, thanks to the tram that takes you to the center for 1.40, it has loading and unloading of water and is marked and paved. The only downside is that when it is very hot this is an oven because it has no shadows."
109758,1236195,5,Pardiko,04/06/2021,"All services, and if you like sports, athletics track, next to it, also a bike path, next to it, which takes you to the Center, tram, at € 1.40 and also takes you to the center, I mean, phenomenal parking."
109758,1232349,4,keas,02/06/2021,"Well connected to the center with the tram and fast entry also from the highway. It has no shadows and that in spring-summer is an oven. It is not flat at all but you can not put blocks, very good antenna signal. At night there is almost no noise and during the day it can hold up very well. Very correct loading and unloading area. Thanks to the city council, it is a pleasure to be well received."

109758,1206424,5,JosePili06,19/05/2021,"Thanks to the city council for providing us with basic services. It is fine to spend the night, but if the noise bothers you a bit, we recommend spending the night somewhere else. We have slept well, great to visit La virgen del Pilar and not put the Ac through the center."

109758,1185353,5,bb.stefkovic,04/05/2021,"Huge car park, right next to the stop to the city center.  One tram ride costs € 1.40 and tickets can be purchased directly at the stop.  Gray and black water can be poured in the car park and drinking water can be added.  There is a sports ground next door.  We didn't stay overnight, just a break during the day."

We heard about one in the morning noise and they were trying to break the locks to carry the bikes. Out of that, all good, an area with all services except electricity, free, with a tram that leads directly to the center, right in front and for 1.40 Euros. I advise that you take care of your belongings and do not park on the limbs. Steal"

I had to tighten the filler cock that was seen to be missing for a long time. I think we all carry some tools in our vehicles and it doesn't cost that much. Not just because of the annoyance, water is a scarce commodity. I repeat, it costs nothing and we all earn a lot and if you don't know how to do it, then call the town hall and let them know so that they can find a solution. Thanks a lot"

109758,1098576,1,Iosef,19/10/2020,They steal. Little vigilance. Not recommended. A bike was stolen from my bike rack during the night while I was sleeping. They broke the lock. They were prepared and it doesn't seem like it was the first time. A shame.

109758,914190,3,feelingood,31/07/2020,"Quiet night. We have not taken the tram to go downtown, the stop is right in front and they pass every few minutes. The noise from the road is not annoying. You cannot go with the AC to the carrefour next door, there is a height limitation to enter the parking lot. The most curious thing is that there is also this limitation to enter the carrefour gas station ... There is a cepsa right next to it and no problem"
109758,902019,4,MargaritaL.A,26/07/2020,"Area with ample seats, emptying and filling of free water. Without eleectricity. In front of the tram stop area to go downtown, quite a lot of traffic but at night it decreases. At night the garbage truck passes by and you can hear a lot. It fills up easily but you can park next to it and wait until there is some free space. Recommended place to visit the city for an overnight stay"
109758,885713,4,EntreCaravanas,21/07/2020,"Counting that it has water to load and emptying gray and black for free, it increases the score to 4 stars, it is very wide and the squares are wide, but it has next to it a road with relative noise level and a tram stop that begins to work at 6 in the morning so it's loud. Otherwise everything perfect. (You cannot remove tables or chairs, open awnings, etc, etc !!)"

We spent 2 nights and everything was great, spacious, level squares, with 2 emptying service places, close to parks and bike lanes and very well connected with the fantastic tram to the center, shopping center etc. Just for how well we were, we plan to go back to Zaragoza from Malaga once it passes and all this that we are experiencing and to enjoy the atmosphere of the street of the tube."

It has an emptying and filling service and a Carrefour 10 minutes away on foot. In front of the area you can take the tram that leaves you in the center in 8 minutes."
109758,857543,4,dosvelas,09/07/2020,It seems that access to the area is incorrectly indicated. You have to get to the bridge and turn right. Go through the gate of the soccer field and continue.

109758,796952,3,padraigl,21/03/2020,"This is was closed off because of Covid-19. There were 2 army personnel there allowing motorhomes to use the services ONLY. No overnight or stopping for a break was allowed.
They said to try find a place outside of a town or village, not a city to spend the night."
109758,794805,5,Barcobird,13/03/2020,"A fairly new site that someone has actually thought about from a motorhomers perspective.Access from the motorway is simple, parking is in flat spacious bays and they are marked diagonally on a one way system so no silly parking. I don’t understand why on one side everyone reverses in, beats the whole idea! It has free water, grey and black dump, well lit and very quiet at night. The city can be reached by tram opposite or scooter etc in 10 mins and the visit to the cathedral makes it all worthwhile. Excellent site, thank you which is probably why it was full, over 30 motorhomes."

109758,792334,5,caso78,07/03/2020,A perfect area. so many cities should follow suit.
109758,792288,4,padraigl,07/03/2020,"This is a large tarmac dedicated motorhome parking area with 36 spaces and free services sandwiched between sports fields and a busy road with a tramline. The dedicated parking spaces are not level. Some motorhomes drive in and some back in but they are designed to drive in with the one-way system. Driving in there is slight dip to the front right which suited our shower drain perfectly. They are not suitable for really large motorhomes (bus type) or motorhomes with trailers. The maximum stay is 72 hours.

Pros:
Free parking.
Free full services excluding electricity.
Local shopping centers, supermarkets, restaurant, cafes and bars. 
Tram station to city across the road, €1.40 for a single.
Outdoor gym.
Bike paths.

Cons:
No shade.
Noisy road at night.
Some motorhomes emptying their grey waste in Aire.

There are full free services excluding electricity with good signage.
The system is 2 fold. When you pull up to fill the fresh water and empty the black WC cassette the grey area in front of you can be used by another motorhome and when you are empting your grey waste a motorhome can pull in behind to use the fresh water tap and empty their black WC cassette.

The grey drain has good flow direction into the center grate even though it's on a slight slope and the motorhome pipe need to be on the upper side.

The black WC drain is 600mm off the ground under a steel cover. The drain pipe is large with no splashback. The cassette push button tap is on the pillar beside the drain and has reduced pressure hence no splashback. 

The fresh water tap is a medium screw-on connection with excellent pressure. The tap has a 3/4 turn handle  to regulate the flow.

There are large bins in the carpark.

There are restaurants and cafe/bars close-by. Carrefour hypermarket in a small shopping mall is about 10 minutes walk towards the city where there are public toilets and charging area for electronics. 5 minutes further on is a bigger shopping center with a large MediaMarkt and Decathlon. The parking is height restricted at both malls so NO motorhome parking available.

Beside the Aire are 8 soccer enclosed pitches with always something going on. A little further up the road is an athletics stadium, again with training taking place most evenings. During busy sports events especially weekends cars will park in the Aire.

We had 3 very quiet nights here eventhough the road can be noisy but that didn't stop us from sleeping.
The only caveat this stay was that 2 motorhomes opened their grey waste in the parking area when the official drain is only 10 meters away, and the Aire wasn't busy.....
Also didn't not see the police this time around.

Bugs/Mosquitoes. (They love us..)
We did not encounter any mosquitoes here at the beginning of March."

109758,787473,4,victoriacavellvc,27/02/2020,Nothing pretty but very functional and appears safe. We stayed one night. Very large spaces in asphalt. Very busy even in February. Other spaces before/after the actual camper car park next to the sports field. All services worked. Easy tram ride to the city. But tickets at the machines at the tram stop. It is noisy as it’s next to a main road but it’s the city and largely quiet midnight to 7am
109758,784860,4,bkb,23/02/2020,"Free parking, water and oil changes. Opposite the tram stop for the city center (€ 1.40 per ticket). Close to sports facilities and universities. Shopping center 10 mins walk. Cycle paths. Calm at night. At 4 p.m., the 36 places are practically all occupied."

Only to buy a card, you have to go to tobacconists and kiosks (the trip costs € 0.70) they are not sold at the tram stations. You can only recharge the card and buy tickets (at 1.35). On Saturday afternoons, almost all the kiosks closed and the one we found open tell us that they are sold out, in the end stanco"

109758,616642,3,arkalira,10/08/2019,"Very well connected by tram with the center but in my opinion it has two important disadvantages: there is no shade anywhere (and in zgz it is very hot in August) and this other inconvenience is somewhat more fortuitous but more annoying even than the heat: Tram maintenance staff was cutting the grass just 20 meters from 1 to 3 in the morning. I thought it was some kind of joke of some campsite and I was about to call the municipal but I saw that it was indeed Ayto staff. Otherwise very good, the correct services and the maximum stay 72 hours. It allowed us to know Zaragoza and leave with a very good taste in this city."

At the entrance of Zaragoza, 40 minutes walking to the center in a straight line, in front of a tram stop (€ 1.35 / every 7min) that leaves you at the Pilarica.

109758,476966,3,patodormilon,05/05/2019,"In addition to the inconvenience of parking cars, the access could be better signaled. For the rest an area was needed in Zaragoza, although it has already been small. Although I have motorhome I do not use the area because I live 10 minutes from elka."
109758,470659,1,taillonnais17,29/04/2019,"The site seems very attractive except that it is extremely noisy (incessant traffic noise from the avenue, shuttles every two minutes of the tramway, fussing sirens screaming ""at the Starsky and Hutch"" Police from 5am, noise of the clipper of a municipal employee - a horror!"
109758,467780,3,diegosport,25/04/2019,"Free area, the area of filling and emptying could be a little wider so you do not have to wait so long when it is full of caravans, having so much space there could have been done, in addition there is a football field and it is full of cars when there is a match The rest of the area is quiet and the tram stops next door"
109758,464776,4,pec66,23/04/2019,"We stayed here for 2 nights. On Sunday 21/04 the car park was full. The motorhomes parked on the car parks next door. Tram right in front of 1euro 35 to visit Zaragoza. Possibility of draining black and gray water, as well as filling the water. Good recent and clean area, light sleep light road noise and tram until midnight."

109758,462549,4,somalillo,21/04/2019,Fairly good. On Saturday morning you wake up surrounded by cars everywhere as there is a sports center there.
109758,461316,4,akawana,20/04/2019,Well connected to the center with the tram. But it fills up with cars that go to soccer games and do not respect them. sites
109758,459305,4,LyG,19/04/2019,"Place with water loading and unloading. About 3km from the center. Very well connected to the center. The tram has the stop next to it. It has large spaces for a motorhome, but there are also more parking for other vehicles. We went at Easter and it was quite busy. quiet place. gratuitous"
109758,457486,5,sp56,17/04/2019,Adapted parking and clean tram lines next to visit bravo and thank you to the city
109758,456634,4,bipbip2,16/04/2019,"Free, very clean, tarmac and spacious pitches, tram nearby, contiguous boulevard but quiet at night. I'll be back ! Thank you to the municipality."
109758,456568,4,javolo65,16/04/2019,"It is a good area, with services and clean. It is far from the center but well connected to the center by the tram that passes in front of the area. Walking about 40min. Near a Carrefour. A good area."
109758,456034,4,Fifida,16/04/2019,"Nice area, tram next door, but it was hard to find because the address was not mentioned, I specify the address: Calle del Poeta Luciano Gracia 50018 Zaragoza Spain"

109758,455174,4,javeasteve5,15/04/2019,"Just stayed 2 nights, including same as last poster. Cannot agree about car situation as always saw vacant spaces when we returned to site and vacant spots during whole of last night. Not the quietest site with main road and tram stop opposite causing squeaky tram brakes to be applied numerous times an hour as tram service is excellent, cheap, efficient and saves 45 mins of walking into town. No problems whatsoever, felt safe with at least 20 plus other vehicles, some whom left early to get to ferry ports."
109758,454286,2,travelingwitharya,14/04/2019,"The area as such, great. Very well connected with the tram and with the free services. The area seemed quiet. But it is a pity that of the 36 seats available, 80% were occupied by private cars. We called the police and they did nothing, the only option they gave us was to wait for a car to leave."
109758,453942,5,Kipjo,13/04/2019,"Beautiful service area, clean, free services. Tram at 50 m, ideal for visiting this beautiful city."
109758,453886,4,Txiki40,13/04/2019,"Supporting the previous comment, it is shameful !! The cars park at ease in this area. And many have to go and can not visit this beautiful city. Then you park your motorhome in car parking and they eat you."
109758,453627,4,elzorromanchego,13/04/2019,"Today Saturday the cars (Cars) occupy 75 percent of the seats for ACs, do not respect the signals, nor the P.Local bother to enforce the signals so the Caravans Auto leave since they can not park."
109758,452740,5,Mizdo,11/04/2019,A great level area with all the services and communicated by means of a tram that is practically in the same door with a cadence of five minutes that leaves you in the center of a fantastic city like Zaragoza in a few minutes. Congratulations to the municipality
109758,451256,5,Xavierteia,09/04/2019,"Congratulate the City Council for such a great idea. The area is very well located, with tram in front, about 4 kms from the pl. of the Pilar. The super to 5 minutes, you can not ask for more, and for free. Now, among all we have to take care of the place."
109758,447610,3,doolittle,01/04/2019,"The area is very good, with a tram stop in front, although walking is a pleasant walk. We must thank the interest of the municipality. A 10 for the motorhome area. The negative point is the lack of control when it comes to preventing parking cars, the municipal police we warned did nothing, and there were cars even in the emptying area. A 0 in this aspect for the town hall."
109758,444488,4,Tonino44,25/03/2019,Very good location ... Lots of places ... but even better by moving away from the stadium ... tram next door ... Crossroads to two stations ... quiet ... convenient to visit Sarragosse.
109758,443773,5,Manek,24/03/2019,"Very good area, good water intakes and empty, tram at 10 steps, highly recommended."
109758,439792,5,HELIOS5,14/03/2019,Great location to visit Zaragoza with the tram station right in front and in 15 minutes you are in the center. It is very quiet at night. Thanks to the municipality of Zaragoza for this beautiful location.
109758,437895,4,mctanguy@free.fr,08/03/2019,Very practical area with all the free services. The locations are wide. We had a hard time finding it is located at the Campus del Ebro tram station and is located in front of the athletics stadium and near a football stadium.
109758,434924,4,feetontour,01/03/2019,"Good and clean service area. Right by a busy street with cars, busses and Tram but quiet during night. Walk 30 min into city or Tram station nearby. Large pitches. Felt safe."
109758,434802,3,SDF24,28/02/2019,"The gray water, black water and clean water filling services work well and are free. Thanks to the municipality of Saragos for its welcome!"
109758,433482,3,Merjo,25/02/2019,"The area to spend the night and visit the city very well, somewhat noisy by the tram but without major problems, the only tap to clean potti leads to error if it was not because it has no thread, I have seen people drinking, they should put some informative sign ."
109758,433329,4,grisou08440,25/02/2019,Free and clean but no connection or emptying. Expect the holds because the places are on slopes. The city center accessible with the tram next door (visible from the parking lot) Noisy by the avenue which is next but good.
109758,431475,4,sixaracautourdumonde,20/02/2019,Beautiful area with delimited and long squares. The historic center is 10 minutes by tram for € 1.35 per ticket. The shopping center is 1 km walk or a tram station to the city center.
109758,430943,4,belengp,18/02/2019,Well connected to the center. Opposite a University with very cheap restaurant cafeteria.
109758,429272,4,ishtar,14/02/2019,"Good place.. Near university and tram, very comfortably situated. All amenities free."
109758,427207,4,sciroco,07/02/2019,"Very good, permanent background traffic but bearable. As already indicated cars are installed on the sites reserved for motorhomes while the parking is very large"
109758,426806,3,Magis82xt,05/02/2019,"Nice for a stop in transit, cars take the place of motorhomes so not sure to find the place. Easy access. Night from Saturday to Sunday no noise. Amazing because near the stadium."
109758,425141,4,calichos,27/01/2019,"Very wide, inclined squares and tram opposite. The collection and unloading of the electric scooters from the station next to it can be annoying. Quiet zone"
109758,425076,4,RubCar,27/01/2019,"On the outskirts of the city but very well connected to the center with tram, buses and bike path. The squares are very wide but with a little inclination. The filling and emptying area is clean. Undoubtedly the biggest problem is that the cars park unceremoniously inside the area and you can arrive with the AC and have no place. You should put a much lighter indicator with the rules"
109758,424632,4,Cio,26/01/2019,"The socket for charging clean water, fixed tap with thread is already finished."
109758,424286,5,camou,24/01/2019,"Very clean, opposite a tram stop, next to a crossroads supermarket. Very large places. Drain all waters and possibility to fill up with water."
109758,422941,3,Treasurebox,16/01/2019,"A large, asphalted area specifically for motorhomes. Trams appear regularly just opposite the car park though we used the many cycle paths to visit and explore the city. We only stayed for an afternoon but the area felt safe and reasonably quiet."
109758,421336,4,Donjavier,09/01/2019,"Very good place to sleep. Quiet. The somewhat precarious services, lacked that are designed by someone who has read at least two words about AC. Excellent place to know the city. By tram you are 5 minutes from the best of the city. We recommend it"
109758,418537,4,Petita,31/12/2018,Good area Well comunicated. Good access Fix / hold water intake and improve drainage of sewage.
109758,418424,3,ibanoe,31/12/2018,"Good esplanade, exclusive sign for motorhomes, spaces wide enough. This cold night, at least 16 motorhomes. The loading / unloading area seems provisional: fountain tap (without thread) and next to a pipe with valve and thread but a little puny (this morning, both without water); the emptying of blacks in a vertical tube ... impractical, unclean. Tram opposite !!"
109758,418361,5,mireieta81,31/12/2018,"They recently opened it and I think it needs to be put into something else. It would improve if it had light and wcs, also with shade for the summer. Spacious places. Well connected to the center with the tram."
109758,418017,4,PyT13,30/12/2018,"Good look. But the City of Zaragoza would achieve its purpose if they better equate the area. That it does not cost so much to clean it up better ... Some toilets, another device to empty the toilet, another place to empty gray water ... I see many squares but if it is full, there will be a lot of glue for emptying ... At 1km there is a very cool shopping center: Great House."
109758,417619,5,Silsal,29/12/2018,New. Comfortable. Broad. With the tram in front that brings you to the center in a few minutes. It is highly recommended.
109758,415591,5,jmalvato,23/12/2018,"Excellent site to visit the city. Exclusive for motorhomes and campers, it is denounced if they put on chocks, tables or chairs are removed and awnings are opened. highly recommended"
109758,415590,3,eeae,23/12/2018,"Good location with tram stop directly opposite. Some details are missing, but to begin with, it's fine. We will increase stars as improvements are seen."
109768,2235565,2,sandrido,14/08/2022,We stopped 1 minute just to take pictures at the bridge. It is right next to the A7 autopista so it is very noisy as a parking lot and I don't recommend it to stay overnight but only for a quick stop. Easy access even for large vehicles.
109768,1708136,5,RatayTeam,11/12/2021,Easy walk to Roman aqueduct (look for wooden path) and nice place to stop for a break
109770,3284046,4,irisrives,11/09/2023,"Very quiet parking by the sea with beautiful views. There are bathrooms that are open during the day until 6 p.m. The pools are very nice and comfortable, and there is a fresh water ""shower"" (a pipe from which water comes out and opens onto a platform, then it is poured into the sea so you don't You can use soap or anything)."
109770,3085602,4,fwildner,06/08/2023,nice spot directly on the coast. we were there on a saturday and there wasn’t much noise or disturbance by others… toilets are very clean & the natural pool + showers are super refreshing in the morning.

109770,2646106,5,MrRolling,07/04/2023,"Beautiful view! Beautiful starry sky! The breaking waves do make some noise, but we found this rather soothing. In the evening there were few people, on arrival around 4 pm there was a lot of crowds in the parking lot of day tourists. Natural pool with lifeguards and toilets. The effort!"
109770,2568039,4,GassieAliaan,04/02/2023,Great place with nice view and close to natural pool. There is a natural well next to it that is flowing continuously that is in use as a freshwater shower. We only had a lot of noise from 3 am until 7 am. First youth with very loud music and when they left from 5-7 am men talking loudly at 2 mtr from our van. So we had a lively night....
109770,2550137,5,LauraSchiller,12/01/2023,Straight and very large parking lot with beautiful views. Directly at the sea. Toilets are currently closed - probably only open in summer.
109770,2534982,5,Bruncini,31/12/2022,Magical place. Just there were no showers and toilets but it is December... We were there with our 2 children (2 years and 7 months). The older one saw small fish and crabs...and the site is just magnificent There is the municipal swimming pool right next to it where we could buy beer and cake :)
109770,2526870,5,Grangefamily,23/12/2022,It's a great spot. large parking lot by the sea and next to the natural swimming pool. Continuous flowing shower. we were alone. big waves so noise of the waves but what a grandiose landscape. one of our best spots
109770,2523379,3,travelbaz,17/12/2022,"The pool and the view are great. The parking spaces are directly in front of a hotel. The question is who is watching whom. The toilets are currently (December) closed. Unfortunately, many people have peed behind the walls and left paper lying around. It stinks. Pity!!"
109770,2279428,5,VirgiDani,21/08/2022,"we loved it and more than that we went with children, quiet"
109770,1824057,5,alle111,15/04/2022,One of my favorite parking spots on Tenerife (if the weather is nice). I love the natural pool with amazing views to the mountains. Also there is a shower with constant water flow. The toilets were close when I was there.
109770,1753436,4,schegy1,12/02/2022,"Parking space nothing special (next to the sea). The toilet is closed at night. The natural pool is great. Do not overlook the shower (pipe with a constant flow of water). However, according to the board, it is not drinkable (it may contain fertilizers). Lots of traffic in the evening and in the morning."
109770,1720582,4,PeachT5,30/12/2021,"good place, it was quiet, nice natural pool"
109770,1710438,5,bigjump,15/12/2021,"This park up ticked all the boxes for us in a self sufficient van... nice quiet parking, natural sea water swimming pool, very few people around. wouldn't suit a motorhome in the high season. 
We only occasionally eat out but an exceptional, highly rated restaurant just a few hundred metres away on a farm tempted us to dine out! 
The cafe was closed while we were there but that didnt bother us."
109770,1666879,4,dansnotresacados,28/10/2021,Pretty view right by the sea. Beautiful sunset and sound of waves. Not many spot but enough for a few cars. There is a shower with fresh water outside and natural pools!
109770,1643495,3,emschen,14/10/2021,Ok parking. It was noisy and a lot of cars came. At 6:30 they start to clean with a blower. Plus side: you can park by the sea.
109770,1120379,3,ju1308,09/12/2020,"Nice place, but no showers / WC as indicated. The natural swimming pools are very pleasant and the village a little decayed."
109770,1116410,5,kayleevandam,19/11/2020,"Maybe I didn’t find the right parking but it wasn’t too big. There were constructions going on so I think that’s it. Still a good spot! It’s next to a hotel where people can see you so I think it’s extra important here to keep the place tidy. Keep your trash, don’t camp, respect the rules :)"
109770,1104428,2,lalorenzo,24/10/2020,"The place is good, but a lot of cars arrived, with music and drinking bottles and we had to go ...."

109781,2294634,2,zonvadrouille,24/08/2022,"Beautiful and calm place. However, the road to get there is a bit chaotic (the GPS took us through paths) and at night the place is gloomy and does not really inspire confidence."

The leveling is a little inclined due to the slope of the street. Quiet pedestrian crossing area as there are no homes on any of the sidewalks. Close to the city center, 10 minutes walking.

The only bad thing is that it is a busy area with many vehicles every day and it can be a bit annoying to rest. But our experience was positive."
109782,1754711,4,ROBERCRIS,13/02/2022,"Very comfortable to park there since you are next to the amphitheater and the city center.

109804,2507387,4,FeeeNdr,27/11/2022,"Clean, comfortable, easily accessible laundry for motorhomes and prices are reasonable. Despite the detergent that is included, I advise you to add detergent because your laundry will smell like nothing but hot water. The WiFi works well, only downside, you have to ask the owner for the code by Whatsapp. I still recommend!"

109811,1600432,4,KilyD,22/09/2021,"It is not bad to spend the night and continue the march. A bit of car noise throughout the night, and you can hear the hum of the power line passing overhead. But for one night it's not bad."

During the day well, at night on the weekend I do not recommend it."

It is the last car wash, so it should be empty at this time. The cleaning water point is away from this point. so you have to be coming and going. Very bad. Only if you're in a hurry to stop."
109835,755001,3,julilla,19/12/2019,"Gray emptying is in the grid between the vacuum area and the car wash area. The emptying of blacks is lifting the sewer in front of the last car wash space, on the right.

We recommend it"

109912,1656849,3,jessen333,22/10/2021,"Unfortunately, this advertised place has closed the outdoor pool for weeks. Indoor swimming pool Small and you don't want that in the sun. WiFi only for a fee and the space is too small for campers over 7 m. Clean yes reception nice The sea is too far away on foot."
109912,1650990,3,storchennest,18/10/2021,"There is nothing wrong with order and cleanliness. Only 3 stars because the places are very tight, too many low trees, the risk of getting stuck, scratching etc. is too big and annoying. You can hardly get around the curves with 7.50m. The satellite reception is also in question. The reservation obligation with a deposit in September was really bad for us, although only 70% was occupied."
109912,1519364,4,txap,27/08/2021,"Impressive facilities, new and very clean bathrooms, the pool also very clean and the water is excellent. In the bar you eat very well. The area to make the waters is very good, for € 0.50 you have 10 minutes of water to fill the water. The beach is 1km away and can be reached immediately by bike or walking. All employees are very majestic and attentive. The only one but is the supermarket, it is very small."
109912,1432779,4,monsieurflash,10/08/2021,Nice campsite with everything available grocery store swimming pool bar restaurant ... super clean sanitary facilities. Shaded pitches.

109912,1362585,5,Tonioga,25/07/2021,"It is difficult for me to give it the maximum score. It is an ideal campsite for me. More than 30 years ago I came for the first time in bungalows. We have been in tent, tent trailer, caravan and now in AC. Family camping, where tranquility and silence prevail. Standards are met. Super clean toilets. In the restaurant you can eat well at a reasonable price. The magnificent staff."
109912,1358414,5,carlitosg,24/07/2021,Large and very quiet campsite. There are quite a few toilets and showers and they are all very clean.
109912,1079162,4,WanderWebb,02/10/2020,"This is a difficult one to rate. Excellent facilites although some were not available due to the time of visit or covid. Better suited, especially in busy periods I think, to smaller units or caravans, we were lucky to find a pitch large enough and/or without low trees to park. Within walking distance of the beach,shops and town but they’re not on your doorstep. Nice enough for a short stay. The longer you stay, the better deal you’ll get."
109912,1078708,5,ju59,02/10/2020,"Extra camping at all levels! Here, cleanliness reigns, friendly staff! Indoor pool a little cool but perfect! I have never seen such clean toilets! I highly recommend !"

Only the seats could offer a little more privacy, since they are all side by side without privacy and so the sardine feeling comes up a bit, but that is complaining on a high level ! Paid 30.80 1Van 2Pers. 1Hund. Nice beach about 15 minutes footpath. We will be back!"

109912,711615,4,Archelon5,03/10/2019,A bit far from the beach. We preferred the camping Molino 2 directly on the beach with space reserved for dogs (it is rare) and a price of 16 € for two with camper and electricity (by cons washing machine 6 € is expensive) .

109914,1783898,4,lifeo8,15/03/2022,"Nice and quiet spot, there was more space when we went there so we parked a little further up the road on a dirt parking space on the side, it's not really the best but it worked the case, in reality there is very little traffic on this road even during the day. The walk is nice, on the other hand the cave paintings you have to have a magnifying glass to see them, they are erased ^^"
109914,1736526,5,Agusverde,18/01/2022,"It is a fairy tale, the path is a bit difficult but it is in the middle of nature, with a stream and hiking trails. If you go in the evening, it is better that way the cars of the hikers will have gone. there will be about 5-7 car parks more or less"

109914,753147,5,Bobstones,13/12/2019,"Love this place stayed here many times for the climbing. Popular at weekends with climbers and walkers etc so park sensibly.  We actually park just above in a ‘lay-by’ as we get more sun on our solar panel, it’s quieter and the views are better."

109918,2480314,4,sirmanolo,03/11/2022,Parking without services. quiet and quite green to be so close to Madrid. I did a bit of partying and no one gave me any trouble. I put 4 premieres for the tranquility and proximity to the city.
109918,1978290,5,LaBlankita,15/06/2022,"Very quiet night despite the heat. We did not sleep in the parking lot as it was full, but in one of the parallel streets, where there are only developments without noise. Ideal location to get out of the hustle and bustle of the capital."

109918,1269280,4,Berto79,21/06/2021,"Parking in front of an urbanization. It is not registered as an AC area or vans. The park next door gives it a green touch. To spend the night as a place of passage, phenomenal."
109918,479254,3,bouyoco,08/05/2019,A parking lot in an urbanization on the outskirts of Madrid. Without services. A little uneven. Slightly short seats. Yes it measures more than 6 meters excels. Quiet to sleep.

109919,1712840,1,lucilla65,19/12/2021,"Parking uphill. Dirty. Very windy. Even if the road is dead-end, cars pass very fast. Very isolated. Given the distance from the drain and the fountain, I consider it very uncomfortable."
109919,1701747,1,park178,02/12/2021,Uphill parking away from loading / unloading which is in the market square. Windy and dirty. Okay to spend a night. In the morning we woke up with a wild boar at the door.
109919,816917,4,carpetman2301,04/06/2020,Perfectly ok to spend a night or two here whilst waiting for the Town Hall to make available your 48 hr permit for the main Aire nearer the town centre.

109920,2011578,1,Nippers,26/06/2022,"Taking into account the area, the council should condition this area for motorhome parking (with water change). We would certainly win and the area would gain a lot from it."

The source of the recreational area to carry water is far from the AC and you must carry a long hose or jugs as we had to do. The setting is beautiful and we slept very peacefully."

109940,2765648,4,Dan-lauJoub,19/05/2023,We spent a very quiet night there on a weekday. The weekends must be more agitated at the sight of the dirt that is left behind. Accessible by motorhome of 7.5 m.

109940,1750882,3,wgeers,08/02/2022,"A very quiet place during weekdays and nights. You can see from the nuisance of dirt, broken glass, plastic and other junk that the youth in the WE are having a hard time. We were there alone for two nights and during the day we imagined ourselves on our dream island!"
109940,1081572,4,burosseontheroad,04/10/2020,"Very good little stop for a snack. The place was unfortunately very dirty, papers, cake wrappers and even a can of motor oil as there is a car bridge. The bridge was also very practical for our van. The view is superb apart from the dirt."

109941,2536489,4,afineta,01/01/2023,"Now it is delimited with squares, but it is comfortable, flat and to make a visit to the routes and the town well (a shame that they charge, for you see a stretch of river with a footbridge....

110000,1251758,1,BasilBolty,13/06/2021,"What makes local councils think that we want to stay on the edge of industrial estates surrounded by vandalised buildings?

110089,1753982,1,estherkuntzelaers,12/02/2022,today the police came to tell everyone that everyone has to leave before the concrete blocks. behind the concrete blocks are campers for weeks and months. too bad they keep the places occupied for people passing through who want to visit Mijas for a day.
110089,1748244,1,chris710,05/02/2022,"In fact, many people believe that they are at home here, it is their second homes for these people from the north (D) who take up all the space and leave everything, chairs, tables, plants, etc., they can even visit the cities, too bad."
110089,1747528,3,Regis13,04/02/2022,Lots of people difficult to have room I was lucky a Frenchman left his pitch when I arrived I spent t4 nights without problem there is water and a point to empty the dirty water. Many live here for several months free parking but you have to stay behind the blocks otherwise the police will have you cleared
110089,1745346,2,7g7g,01/02/2022,"stayed one night this year. what a dump. terrible camping behaviour. emptying grey water in the grass at the rear, toilets down a manhole in the carpark. chairs tables and washing out. place smells bad too. dog shit everywhere! of all the places I've seen over the years this one needs regulating or clearing"
110089,1742309,4,peetenman,27/01/2022,"Nice place, the road is clearly audible. It is now enforced that no more campers are allowed in front of the white deposit. Pity was always very pleasant with several campers."

Police swing by from time to time but it's never really an issue.
Water tap at the back to the right of the stairs, grey pits in the ground. Super stores within ten min walk and a lovely large local market wed & sat. 
the bus to get to Fuengurola & Marbella is also only a 8/10 min walk away."

The market on wed & Saturday is great for fresh fruit/veg, clothes and odd bits n pieces."
110089,1282209,4,jomaaut,27/06/2021,"Good place to park and pecnote, tap to load water and sewer to empty grays, all free, there is a large sign that says that you cannot camp, as there were several with awnings, tables and chairs outside. I have been 2 nights and although there is a gutter where it can be emptied, some have emptied on the ground at night. Then we complain if we are forbidden to enter I feel ashamed of others"

110089,1117510,3,noaneal,24/11/2020,"Okey, this is a special location, which is why I am also adding a review ... when you enter the parking lot you will see a large place on the right where you can park the camper (when we arrived they were certainly there with 40 - it is 24/11/2020 - low season). Right in front of you is a white cabin, these are the toilets and 5 meters in front is a sewer lid with a cord, which you can lift to discharge. Be careful! To the left of all this in the corner of the site you see a bridge, there you can take water, for free, mind you, tap has screw thread but is small connection !! Only location around marbella where you can discharge and take fresh water so is ok, but I wouldn't stay there at night ..."
110089,1110373,4,debwilliams,31/10/2020,Arrived 4pm very busy with around 50 Van's    great spot for short walk into promenade with many bars and restaurants.. free water in far corner and manhole for  grey water.   would recommend.. not a pretty place to park but convenient stayed 4 nights
110089,1047640,4,viccoz,14/09/2020,Very good place with all water services (rustic but necessary). Black water there is a sewer in front of the toilets that can be opened and flushed there. A bit noisy due to the proximity to the road but acceptable.
110089,975853,2,dekapax,18/08/2020,"The only place in the surroundings where you can fill with clean water and beware that the pump is not easy to see, it is at the bottom of the parking lot next to the underground bridge that passes gray water on the other side of the road, you have to raise a small sewer that has a handle next to the toilets (closed by covid) sewage water"
110089,958389,4,nalha,13/08/2020,Free parking with free water filling. The tap is threaded and is at the end on the left. We didn't sleep but there were quite a few motorhomes.
110089,951756,4,Luzindel,11/08/2020,"Large free parking next to a golf course. Very calm. Nearby there are supermarkets and restaurants. Located 8-10 minutes walk from the beach. Next to it they have a market on Saturdays, so it has a water source to recharge and a bathroom to unload black water, there are also garbage containers. Tables and chairs can be taken out. I recommend it."
110089,896525,5,Khalid82,25/07/2020,Nice place to stay not so far from the beach. Aldi and lidl are at walking distance. Toilets are open for use and when we woke up on saturday we found out that there is a market just 100 meters away from the parking lot.
110089,875139,5,pudska,17/07/2020,"Stayed here for nine nights, no bother beach a short stroll away, Aldi and Lidl just a few minutes walk, nice and quiet at night and if you want or need some solar work doing or upgrading too lithium, see mark in the mercedes camper, he has a sign in the window."

110089,789848,1,SlowWeGo,02/03/2020,"Large parking, very ugly. Black water service is basically a hole in the ground, quite dangerous and very disgusting. Grey waters said to be dumped anywhere, we didn’t do it. To fill up clean water takes ages as there’s a huge queue. We found the place quite miserable and would only use it if its a must."
110089,775972,4,biquet5155,03/02/2020,Very large parking lot with services. Convenient for a stopover. Aldi and Lidl nearby. Along a busy road. Pretty seaside resort.
110089,772628,3,grandadsgapyear,26/01/2020,"Great stop to fill and empty, thank you to the town. There is a Lidl just up the road and a launderette on the opposite side of the road from Lidl, both within walking distance. In the town main square is a hardware shop,todo una euroshop, which’s is trying to cater for motor homes and stocks items like toilet chemicals and some camping equipment. The owner is very helpful and quite a character, you’ll know him if you meet him."

110089,755864,2,LostAndFound,22/12/2019,"Without much atmosphere, but very central with proximity to the center, supermarket, beach. CAUTION: Disposal on the manhole cover is not permitted. I was observed by a city employee sitting in a parked car. I had to endure an emotional reprimand and a fine of up to 3,000 euros."
110089,754902,4,riffian,19/12/2019,Registration with the police unnecessarily complicated. Take all the documents and the green card with you. Wednesday is market day and the tap is blocked until 3 p.m. It is one of the few places between Malaga and Gibraltar where you can get a quick service.
110089,750116,3,zaina,05/12/2019,"Be careful this place may be considered as an area but the police (friendly) is there to remind you that it is not one and requires permission to park a few days. With the respect that one owes to the commune, it is necessary to leave this place clean and not to camp if one wants to be able to return there. Thanks to Cala de Mijas."
110089,742715,3,GeorgyBoy,13/11/2019,"Very large motorhome, suitable for large motorhomes. Wednesday there is a market on the square, there is still enough room. Then the toilets are also open. There is possibility to take water."
110089,742260,3,eduvipa,12/11/2019,"Quiet place to spend a few days, services could be improved but seen what there is for other places better not to complain, nearby there are supermarkets and bars and a few meters the bus to Marbella and Fuengirola"
110089,735411,3,Vandiamo,01/11/2019,"Perfectly adequate Aire in good location for bus M220 to Marbella under bridge on roundabout under main road. Very basic facilities, grey water down manhole cover in front of toilets. WC manhole cover in front of fresh water tap which is just a push button but we tend to use a strap around the unit to keep it flowing. No sign of any police whilst we were there. Huge Aire & very quiet"
110089,727950,3,Christiangueripel,23/10/2019,"Huge parking lot to spend a night safely around many cc, possibility to fill up water with a push-button that is used mainly for fairgrounds draining sewage on land: raise hatch, as for the cassette? some also empty in this hatch, not possible to rinse !! in the morning the market settles, no more possible to empty anything until 15h."
110089,722158,5,sjmotorhome,15/10/2019,"This place is most certainly underrated. 5 star all the way, such a fantastic free place to stay for a few days with a beautiful town just a few minutes walk. They also have amazing beaches. So happy to if found this place. I would come pre empty on waste as I’m still not sure how to dump here but I have found the fresh water place in the far right corner as you look across the carpark"
110089,718267,1,Maremil,10/10/2019,"We stopped just to empty and fill deposits, it was not known where to do the job clearly. After asking, we didn't find it convenient to have to empty (in a sewer 50 cm in diameter and about 2 meters high, I say it for safety) and fill 50 meters away, it is not comfortable!"
110089,701432,5,phicri,23/09/2019,"Very happy to have found this area. So complicated in the sector. We can drain and fill except at market hours, wait 15h. We feel safe with several motorhomes. Near the beach and shops. Very good restaurant L'Albahara located down the blue footbridge."
110089,676376,2,jonerko,04/09/2019,"It seems that Wednesday make a flea market and it is inaccessible to reach the source site. To top it off, a vehicle labeled by the town hall parked above where the waters are emptied."
110089,650524,2,silviadri,22/08/2019,"To empty right in front of public toilets there is a sewer cover to empty. A police officer directed us because we couldn't find it, since people were emptying it by the tap and they were cleaning it, and asked us if we could put it here. He told us that on the part of the town hall we were welcome but please be respectful. To park is fine"
110089,598384,1,rodandoenfamilia,04/08/2019,"Total lack of concern on the part of the town hall, after being an area of the few in the area, when we arrive we see that the passage through a paddle tournament has been blocked (which is already over and they are dismantling). They should worry a little more about those who use the facilities and at least limit the download area so that they do not occupy it with the uses they give to the space. Really shameful, tourists should appreciate a little more than the end of the day what we come to is to leave money in the city. Well, we won't have to spend our money on another town that accepts us."
110089,527211,3,jlpc,24/06/2019,It is the fairground esplanade. If you look on the floor next to the water is the sanitation box and you can empty gray and black with the drain just in the hole or fall more on the floor than in the chest. It is not made for motor homes. In another corner of the esplanade there is space to park but you are surrounded by weeds and dirt. It is not pleasing to the eye. Use emergency and follow.
110089,518989,4,natalu,17/06/2019,"Nice, free place. Quiet ambience, many long-term campers. Many supermarkets, bars and shops nearby. 10 minutes walk to the beach."

110089,511694,5,cdejong,11/06/2019,"Excellent spot. Basic, but everything there. Rare sight on the costa del sol. Everything is paid or turned into campsite or apartments. Friendly atmosphere, quiet at night. Golf club behind so be aware that you might end up with some golf balls against your camper, although we didn’t have that (4 nights). Say hello to Mark in his big Mercedes 814D, he knows A LOT and camps out there pretty much always."
110089,490652,5,Elisa38,23/05/2019,Very good place. I recommend because on the coast it is not easy to find a free area especially spacious not far from the sea
110089,490627,4,stokespandj,23/05/2019,"Essentially a large gravel car park, but plenty of room and only 400m to the beach. Town with plenty of bars, cafes, shops and supermarkets close by. Services basic. Water tap is far corner and black/grey waste near locked toilets. Toilets open during market hours only. Note: services unavailable during market (Wednesday and Saturday) so if you need remember to use on the night before. Very quiet at night. For free, near the beach - thank you for providing this area on the Costa del Sol."
110089,475143,5,ElChispi71,04/05/2019,"Large and spacious area. Although the A7 passes nearby, only a slight rumor is heard. The filling of perfect water, the emptying is more cumbersome since it is necessary to go towards the cabin of the WC and there to raise a cover of culvert to empty. The beach is a short walk, do not hesitate to eat some delicious spiced sardines. Thanks to the City Council for supporting tourism in motorhomes."
110089,461619,4,pabscon,21/04/2019,"Large esplanade with a corner full of motor homes, jacket and some car spending the night. The town center is next door and with many restaurants and bars."
110089,447009,4,Patchris27,31/03/2019,"Many CC back from Morocco, but we found a place along the golf course. Drain gray and black water by raising the disgust plate in front of the public toilets that open only on Wednesday and Saturday morning for the market, on this occasion the emptying is not allowed these two mornings there."
110089,434804,5,KanttiAdvanture,28/02/2019,We just use warer refill. Water is fresh and really good taste. Water tab is far at corner.
110089,433571,3,Maetthy,25/02/2019,The place is ok. Tuesdays is on the large tar surface of the Spanish market. The traffic on the A7 is not too disturbing.
110089,430474,3,CarlyWicks,17/02/2019,"You can empty grey and black waste by lifting a drain cover next to the toilet block.
Water is in the far right corner."

110101,2057222,1,MontseRuiz,10/07/2022,"The place is beautiful, there is a hermitage and a bar. But to go with a camper impossible. It is full of weekenders and badly parked cars, even on the shoulders. We had to turn around."

110101,1645810,5,mirori,15/10/2021,"Narrow road. Very nice, quiet place… we found the hermitage closed, it is big, picnic area, etc. tb there is a closed bar type ""food truck"" (a trailer), a fountain… we went there in October."
110101,1639570,5,FieseKante,11/10/2021,One of the most beautiful spots in the area! An almost 360 degree view over the valley. There is access to toilets at the church and in the high season you will meet the super nice owner of a food truck there.
110101,1610505,1,Atolondrao,26/09/2021,"Nice lost site but unfortunately overexploited, I have known it for years and I will not return. A shame ..."
110101,1416701,4,palomamoreno,07/08/2021,"Nice place with a foodtruck next to the hermitage that when everyone leaves is very quiet. Too bad you understand that There, when we arrived they doubted whether to leave. There are many picnic tables and a gazebo."
110101,1340175,4,jalomur,19/07/2021,"Ribas de Freser. Good natural site. We went on Saturday and therefore there was a lot of van occupying the best areas, so it is recommended not to be late. Quiet and with views."
110101,1336874,4,black8j,18/07/2021,"A perfect place, incredible views, very quiet at night! I only have 2 but, the place has become a bit crowded during the day since they have opened a kind of bar with a terrace giving even more play to the fact of being able to spend a pleasant time, have barbecues and many routes on foot, and the other but It is the fact that there is already a sign indicating that camping is prohibited! Still, spectacular!"
110101,1331502,5,Fario83,17/07/2021,Access by narrow and sloping road but what a view on arrival! Set up as a picnic area with several bbqs under the pines. Very clean. Numerous locations for cc. No services.

110101,783647,5,Thermalnermal,20/02/2020,"Stunning location. however there is now a post preventing parking next to the hermitage. the car park for the picnic area  has an overhanging tree and likelihood of grounding especially if you have underslung tanks, long wheelbase, long rear overhang etc. would not advise over 5m van to access. 2 larger vans can park on concrete area next to picnic ground."
110101,755894,4,nyerra88,22/12/2019,Great to eat and spend the day. Messas and bbq. We have not stayed to sleep but it seems quiet. The only bad thing is two giant antennas.

110104,3196730,5,jerome6769,21/08/2023,"Nice stopover for one night. no services but place in the middle of nature and calm. Small car park on the other hand and not wide access road. Dead end. Not recommended for large motorhomes, especially if other vehicles are present. The U-turn may be impossible."
110104,3181501,3,oceeme,19/08/2023,"It is probably better just to stop to eat and rest, although there is surely no problem staying overnight. As they have indicated before, you have to follow the Maps signs until you see the orange indications on the road for ""Pista"" and ""Pesca"". The place is not super clean, but the tranquility and solitude are worth it."

110104,2691317,5,Mutley952,23/04/2023,"Lovely quiet place to spend the night.  We went to the end of the road and on to the gravel by the dam and used levellers to get relatively flat, on the turning circle by the picnic benches would have been fine as well, we just didn’t want to block access as several fishermen came down but were very friendly.  Great place to walk the dog, very dry undergrowth already so don’t have any open fire."

110104,1023332,5,Mjarissa,03/09/2020,A beautiful place. Google maps however will probably send you there via dirt roads. If you inspect the maps in satelite mode you will find a more easy way along the water.
110104,798124,5,izumiberat,06/04/2020,Very nice. We just spent three nights there. The police have passed. They were very friendly and just asked us how many days we were planning to stay.

110205,1747825,4,roncon28,05/02/2022,"Overnighting very calmly and very well is an esplanade, next to the hermitage there is a fountain, near the place there is a lot with dogs that from time to time bark as if there were no tomorrow. Recommended and quiet place if it weren't for the dogs and their uneducated owner."
110205,1747820,2,Xarifa,05/02/2022,"Large space and actually very quiet, if not several of a neighbor's dogs would bark non-stop."
110205,1707198,4,bigarena,09/12/2021,"2021 12 08 simple and quiet parking still alone in this season, water nearby."
110205,1700842,3,Elze,30/11/2021,"Nice, flat terrain. Water at the playground. Starting point for many long-distance walks. Cycling routes through the mountains and valleys. There are no shops, so bring supplies. Slept well, until at 3 o'clock dogs barked....... and at 5 o'clock the rooster began to crow. Unfortunate."
110205,1180938,3,xondi,28/04/2021,"There is another source with good water pressure at the end of the field, next to the hermitage, next to the playground."

110206,3097531,4,evelyn82,07/08/2023,Perfect parking for a day at the beach with the dogs! maximum height 2'20. You cannot spend the night specified before arriving.
110206,3082538,1,margon8,05/08/2023,"Been there several times and it was great, but seems they prohibited sleeping. Great day beach with Dogs, but find some other place at night."

110206,2978058,1,mechanicznapomarancza,17/07/2023,"There is no way to get there now, 2,1 m high restriction and sign saying no sleep overnight."
110206,2868941,5,maii2,18/06/2023,"The site is very good and it is very quiet, maximum height allowed 2.5m, the path is a bit uncomfortable but it is worth it. There are no shades and the showers on the beach do not work due to the drought. There were many vans all along the beach. Dog friendly beach nearby."
110206,2772905,5,traveleurope,21/05/2023,Beautiful pitch right on the beach! There are bins and toilets on site that we were able to use during the day.

110206,2711325,5,roadtripsta,30/04/2023,looks windy but also very beautiful. Attention: access restrictions from 2.5m. but you can drive past the gate on the left.
110206,2604141,4,Laukha,09/03/2023,"As there is the barrier, we tried the path that bypasses it, it's a bad idea because we got stuck in the sand! Once out the spot is really perfect we were alone facing the beach"
110206,2514716,5,helenakolb,06/12/2022,"beautiful in the off season! the police came in the morning and asked big motorhomes to leave, they didn't say anything about our 2.60m Ducato."
110206,2489402,4,Souldiver,10/11/2022,"I liked it very much. Please, dear people, don't just leave your output and that of your dogs lying around, otherwise it will soon no longer be possible to park here. It has enough trash cans. So pack your (and your dogs) legacy in a dog poop bag and dispose of it."
110206,2410286,5,CharlesPruvost,28/09/2022,Dream spot! The feet in water! Spots all along the way. Quiet night. Wake up with the sunrise. A lot of van but a lot of space. Lots of trash cans present so use them. The police come by but say nothing. IN THE TOP.
110206,2352197,2,mrselman,08/09/2022,"I would not go there again! Bad smell, dirt and a lot of noise at night (at 4 a group of people started talking loudly near our van and we had to ask them to lower their voices). Warning: avoid areas where the sand is soft, at night it is easy to miss them and get stuck. Still a safe place is the least bad of the nearby options."
110206,2340721,4,chris63000,05/09/2022,Super spot difficult to access with a van but we went through the small path next to the barrier which is a bit chaotic if you go slowly it passes. In addition we are facing a beach for dogs which is very good.
110206,2244967,3,tenebra_tattoo,15/08/2022,"good place but it is a natural park. Something I don't understand is the beach bar that opens at 11 at night with its respective bottle. The policeman who passes by in the morning to control the campers makes more sense if he passes by at night. I recommend parking at the end of everything, towards Roses to avoid the noise of music, cars, etc. I'm amazed that in a natural park they allow that but AC's don't..."
110206,2106962,1,Tracey-jo,22/07/2022,there are 2.5m height barriers blocking off both entrances to the beach road and the way round is blocked off... maybe it will be reopened out of season

110206,1675895,5,ruthWermter,03/11/2021,"Quite a long way just before the beach. When we were there, there were buses and camper vans every few meters. very chilled and calm atmosphere. stayed 2 nights and would come again :)"
110206,1651738,5,kewanee_journey,18/10/2021,"Super quiet night with a great sunrise, 20sec from the beach in addition in the off season you can walk on the entire beach with the dog not just on the really top dedicated area, there are plenty of places to park, I recommend"

110206,1431265,5,PraiaSara,09/08/2021,Extraordinary site in front of the beach with the possibility of a beach for dogs. Quiet environment during the day and at night and it is also quite level.
110206,1373644,5,IndiavsIrene,28/07/2021,"Parking in front of the beach, dogs allowed. Level squares. The police pass by and no problem. Absolute tranquility. Views of the entire coast. To go through the access road bar of 2.5 for vehicles."

110209,2607084,1,zilarkara,12/03/2023,"Not recommended for vans, yesterday I parked there with the intention of spending the night and when I returned, broken window, stolen radio."
110209,2558594,1,Zeerid,23/01/2023,"Would not recommend this spot. Stayed here one night, next day someone tried to break into the van beside us during broad daylight. Scared him away by pointing pepper spray at him. Left a note for the other camper."
110209,2515702,4,DanRamone,07/12/2022,We used the parking during the day to visit the city. Lot of space but pretty dirty.
110209,2515351,5,konto,07/12/2022,"A big parking lot. Used for an afternoon visiting the city. Sign says there are cameras. There were some other  campingcars too. Dont understand the low rating of this place, its ok and there are lamps too. We were not robbed, so 5/5."
110209,2503626,3,celenotaygete,23/11/2022,"Nothing special here, even stood here alone between the cars. But within walking distance of the old town, which is well worth a visit, 10min. Containers at the driveway and had a quiet night."
110209,1898034,3,KarryB,18/05/2022,"Good location to visit Tarragona. The parking lot is rather dirty, although there are recycling bins there now, but yeah, no shade. Would arrive in the morning or evening. Spent one night there, was quiet."
110209,1871958,3,Toja22,05/05/2022,"Good for visiting Tarragona,but I would not sleep here as it is just a dirty parking. 
Free,no services, recycling bins. The cathedral is at about 10 minutes walk."
110209,1761558,3,Alih,20/02/2022,Not much to look at but nice park nearby. A few cafes and a supermarket within 5 mins walk. 15 minutes up the Ramblas to town. Although it wasn't pretty felt safe.
110209,1732981,3,AnRod,13/01/2022,"I spent 1 day and 1 night there. well 10 minutes walk from the city center. calmed down. on the other hand, if you want a place, you must arrive early in the morning before working hours or in the evening after working hours. the day is complete. filled with cars of the locals who work nearby"
110209,1707479,4,Elerrante,10/12/2021,"Parking for the night, go to the city if necessary and follow the route. It is not to be more than a day, as it is for local use."
110209,1685319,2,Chcol89,11/11/2021,".We arrived around 10am and it was armored with cars everywhere, only one motorhome had managed to park, too bad. We went to avenue Carrer Ernest Lluch parked on this street near ALDI, 1.7 km from the historic center"

110209,1138732,4,EkstraMisjaPL,18/02/2021,"Good parking to park the car away from the center and bustle.  Unfortunately, there's a lot of rubbish around.  Locals often come and go - the biggest traffic after work.  Sunny, no trees.  You can charge the battery from solar panels."
110209,1121666,5,Barbulzard,16/12/2020,"Hello there, the place is very practical, easily accessible (even for trucks of 6 meters in length) flat and close to the old center of Tarragona. We stayed there all day and it went well"
110209,757353,3,mumdventure,27/12/2019,"Perfect for parking time to visit the old city, it is really 2 minutes. On the condition of finding a place. I did not want to sleep there the place does not seem safe."

110209,650447,1,floma1921,22/08/2019,"We went there on August 21st. The police arrived at the parking lot and told us that it was not safe to spend the night here, that cars were often fractured. They advised us to go to one of the car parks around the beaches which were much safer."

110213,2566977,2,Hector.P.,03/02/2023,"Nice spot but kicked out by the police in the morning after first night. No ticket, policemans were cool. Seems this place isn t allowed for campers"

110213,2550429,5,TaijaH,13/01/2023,"The area is very large and there are plenty of options where to park. There are also picnic tables, outside grills and trashbins all over the place. We stayed two nights in January without any problems. Very calm and surrounded by nature. There are also several hiking paths going around the forest."

110213,1612139,3,aquindecisa,27/09/2021,"They do not let you spend the night. You can go for the day. It is a very cool place with picnic areas and you can enter with the van. The path to the picnic area is regular, you have to go slowly. I give it 3 stars because I liked the site but they could enable an overnight area in one of the plains and it would be very very top"
110213,1296870,1,Cordy,04/07/2021,We didn't go in for the closing times indicated at the gate. We were not sure if they would throw us out at night or not.

110213,1138629,4,tukinga,18/02/2021,"We spent the night here with no problems. Super nice picnic place in the pine forrest accessible by car.  There are people jogging and going on a walk in the morning and few cars passed by, but it was very quiet at night. Important if you need to work: we had no internet connection, problems with the signal."
110213,1134581,5,Estraellia,02/02/2021,"Extraordinary place, surrounded by a big forest, very peaceful. busy on weekends, local are coming for barbecue and hikes. but in week time, super quiet."

110213,1029916,4,RikiEvalia,06/09/2020,"Good place to sleep. Very quiet even being Saturday. Watch out for the floor next to the tables, we get stuck. Luckily we pushed the van out and slept along the paved road."
110213,972963,4,Jogalopez,17/08/2020,"Pine forest with several access points, large parking areas among the pine trees, ideal for children to run and play. Quite a few tables and benches and some barbecue although obviously forbidden to make fires in summer ... a lot of tranquility."
110213,944272,3,PeugeotGAL,09/08/2020,"We spent a night with the dog on a Saturday in August, it was very quiet. In theory you can't stay overnight, but there are no signs anywhere. The civil guard did not pass, so we spent a quiet night. There are no services, only water at the beginning of the pine forest. Very shady area and picnic areas, with a bumpy road. People walk by with dogs, on horseback ..."

110213,733025,5,GoingThisWay.nl,29/10/2019,"Magical place! Go a little further than the P4N location and you will find a square parking area a little into the woods, so you are even further away from the road and more into the forest. Really quiet at this time of year. The acces road is really easy.. no problem at all.. just go slow.. Only weird thing is the constant humming of the nearby powerlines ;)"
110213,717983,4,caddythecanper,10/10/2019,"Very calm area with tables, be careful, very difficult road"
110213,689601,4,Alyafri,14/09/2019,"Access in poor condition, but the ideal site. For the busy day of walkers who respect your privacy, at night super quiet. Very beautiful, great for children and dogs"

110213,540789,4,Meera1,06/07/2019,"Nice peaceful shaded area. Friendly local dogs. If you head downhill you’re reach a river where you can wash. DONT take the road the satnav takes you as it is so bumpy, a real road runs parallel to it and you can turn in. Police passed twice during night but didn’t stop to bother us."
110213,496070,5,LudwigsOdyssey,29/05/2019,"Really nice place here, peaceful with plenty of shade, police come by just to check so makes you feel secure. You may here some strange noises in the night, that'll be the horses!"
110213,465153,4,chickpea,23/04/2019,"A lovely woodland picnic area. Used a lot by dog walkers and joggers during the day. We were the only van there and on our own over night. Instead of driving through the entrance, which has big concrete gate posts, follow the public road to the left, and there is another entrance on the right which avoids the rough track."
110213,434566,5,thibothibo,28/02/2019,"Incredibly quiet and beautiful place. Barbecues available and wood all over the forest? There is a motorhome area to go for a drain and water 15 minutes north, which is convenient. And a large commercial area 10 minutes before Algesiras. Really great for kids, and all sizes of heavyweight. To access it, prefer the small road on the left which is paved and regular, otherwise the path is not simple as you can read in the other comments. Enjoy!"
110213,433067,5,pmc.ld,24/02/2019,"Totally agree with all previous comments. Super spot for a camp in the peace and nature. On the weekends, hundreds of locals invest in a day of outdoors, barbecues and picnics in a good-natured atmosphere. At night, at this moment, everyone returns to their home and calm returns, absolute."

110227,1963590,2,YvonManue,10/06/2022,"Parked on a dirt parking lot in the middle of olive trees, why not. A short walk along a river. Very busy area during the week too. To sleep there, why not, for those who like to be 50 meters from the road that is ultimately very busy during the day but also at night. For us, it will be the only night."
110227,1092683,5,PaVan,13/10/2020,Very calm and safe place.
110227,514205,5,didivisi,13/06/2019,Parking in the middle of old olive trees. Flat and vast ground. River nearby arranged for swimming. Snack bar at 200 m. Well-marked hiking and mountain bike departures. We had a quiet night.

110229,3215896,3,AnitaPhilippe,25/08/2023,"The park indicated here has a height limitation. We parked on the side road, it's not level and not much space. Place with some shade. It is noisy (city center and popular festivities were taking place). Bathrooms in terrible conditions and the showers on the beach had the water cut off due to the little rain. I give 3* because it is a practical and safe place."
110229,2633442,1,Aguila6,01/04/2023,"We were on 03.31.2023, impossible to park, the plugs do not work, the power has been cut, so the site has little interest since the parking lot has a maximum height barrier of 2m so that AC does not enter. We do not understand how Ibiza discriminates in such a way against ACs and other homes with wheels."
110229,1862016,3,vanlifersswe,30/04/2022,"Okay place to stay for the night, a quiet little town. Nice beach and cute cafés and restaurants around"

110229,1724563,4,Diaspora,03/01/2022,"In winter, nice and calm bay to park and stay the night. Playground with picnic tables right at the beach. In weekends, Dutch snacks, refreshing drinks, good music and great people at the Amigos bar."
110229,1492367,5,Silvia2220222,21/08/2021,"We arrived at 5 in the morning and there was room to park, we spent the night without any problem. At 100 m is the cove, there are supermarkets at the foot of it."

Has good mobile signal, is quiet at night, with only a few cars passing and parking there during the day, and there is a clean and free toilet in the gas station up the road. The only issues were that it was very windy when we were there and it felt quite exposed, and there was a pile of manure nearby which smelt awful!"
110252,2723182,5,vivirnoescaro,04/05/2023,"Quiet place with unbeatable views. Picnic areas, hiking trails and good coverage if you need to work. We spent a couple of very quiet nights, totally alone and with zero noise"
110252,2661699,3,LaSardinha,11/04/2023,Good place to spend the night. There is no space for many vans and it is easy for it to fill up. The surroundings and the views are worth it!
110252,2617694,3,malte24,20/03/2023,Beautiful place unfortunately a lot of traffic that drives past very densely and quickly. A trash can would be great.
110252,2569295,5,aidanjwillmott,05/02/2023,"great spot, stayed 2 nights. the best view possible. no serivces, toilet at petrol station 5 minutes drive, good small shop too. recommend for visiting ports natural park"
110252,2515746,4,AlbaRuben,07/12/2022,"Cool. Quiet space on the edge of the viewpoint, between vineyards and land. Close to make routes. Right next to it was a children's playground. The bad thing is that we were 3 vans and it didn't fit anymore."
110252,2439220,5,andreumas,12/10/2022,"We spent the night there and it was great, without any problems!"
110252,2424845,5,agnes246,05/10/2022,Spectacular site
110252,2312278,5,bettaejany,28/08/2022,We spent a silent night with the sunset over the mountains. It is a 6-seater picnic area with games for children but no services and rubbish must be taken away.

110252,1490103,1,rosaguerrero,21/08/2021,Summer Friday with large bottles. We had to leave at 11 at night because they had a party there with loud music. A shame because the site is beautiful

110252,768018,5,SteveA12003,13/01/2020,Small car park next to a kids play area. Stunning views. Great place to start cycle rides. Stayed for two nights. Had one woman drive past wagging her finger at us. Rural Police drive past twice on the first night with nothing said. People do drive past very quickly but not between 8pm and 7am so a quiet night. Got to say it again stunning views.
110252,748626,2,frankk67,30/11/2019,"Not recommended to go with pets, the asphalted road passes cars and sometimes very fast."
110252,728446,5,Amandinemb100,23/10/2019,Perfect place! Amazing views ! And calm assured! I stayed there one night with dog and cat no problem! And in smaller water tap low flow! But it always helps!

110261,2751762,3,patriciasab,15/05/2023,"Small car park, a little too isolated. Just suitable for picnics."
110261,2720246,4,Iresanmi,03/05/2023,Very comfortable place near the highway to spend the night. A little noise from the road but it doesn't bother sleeping. Ideal for a stop to rest and continue the next day.
110261,2643190,5,FurguiRoque,06/04/2023,"Quiet and clean place to spend the night, with a path in the lagoon to see more than 50 species of birds."

110261,2482741,4,Pfeffer,04/11/2022,"Here again, one of the few places that (in almost 4 years) have not changed for the worse. Thank you - garbage only in the bin !!"
110261,2482540,4,enzohuber,04/11/2022,"Good place, with a trash can. level surface. Relatively quiet but the cars drive past the parking lot relatively quickly."
110261,2144287,4,pernilladirkx,30/07/2022,very spacious and flat i was all alone in the middle of august so I was a bit scared but no reason nothing in the night except for cars on the highway. in the morning many cyclists and local people coming to put their trash in the bin. not very clean place but okay
110261,1809207,4,ronjawanderlust,07/04/2022,"Good place for one night. A short walk to the lagoon is worthwhile. Little traffic, more cyclists."
110261,1807998,4,Mymy6231,06/04/2022,"Simple parking right next to the lake, with a nice walk along the nature reserve. Right next to the highway: at night you can hear the trucks slightly but that didn't stop us from sleeping. Avoid if you are a light sleeper!"
110261,1786852,4,Leonhymer,18/03/2022,Pleasant car park. Lots of birds to see and rabbits. It is true that the highway is heard but it did not disturb us to sleep..
110261,1762947,4,davecasc,22/02/2022,"Nice parking area for one night. A little road noise but not bad. Sadly, the circular walk around the lake has been closed off. You can walk to the observatories in either direction but not all the way around."
110261,1459171,3,didyway,15/08/2021,Fairly flat parking lots. But noisy: noises from the highway and possibly people parked. We were unlucky: a family made a noise just late at night.
110261,1132541,4,Estraellia,23/01/2021,Nice place to stay near hiking path and natural reserve. busy in weekends
110261,996720,4,Endgegner,23/08/2020,"Really nice place, even if the comments are confusing. Easy to find, had quiet all night and heard nothing from the motorway, was woken up early by the gunfire, is a hunting area next door. So today was a vegetarian day. Thanks for the tip!"
110261,983497,4,cjboned,20/08/2020,Quiet place. There is the possibility of many places in front of the entrance to the lagoon on the other side of the road. In the same entry only 2-3. We spent the night with only two more vans. A bit of noise from the road and nearby airport. Better with a mosquito net for the bugs. Lots of movement in the early morning of people with bikes and walking.
110261,789798,4,surfingal,02/03/2020,Stopped here for one night two weeks ago. As previously said parking for two vans in small car park but additional large parking area on other side of road. Road noise throughout most of the night. A twitchers paradise and surprisingly busy from about 8am.
110261,697115,2,"Neal_der,_der_mit_Marthe_zusammen_ist",19/09/2019,"Parking ok, but definitely not recommended for the night. The highway is very loud. The trails are really nice. We drove on"
110261,664755,1,Hook72,28/08/2019,Unfortunately no shade places. We drove back after half an hour. Not recommended in August. Nature around the lake very nice.

110261,540887,5,Superrobby,06/07/2019,"Beautiful place! There is indeed a large car park on one side of the road but also a very small car park just opposite, perfectly accessible to large size (my cc is 7.5m). Thank you for thinking of preserving this place right in the middle of nature."
110261,459884,4,LDVgirl,19/04/2019,"What a great place to spend the night! Really quiet, despite being just next to the motorway. 

Nice walks along the lake, big waste containers. I would def recommend it."

110276,2995524,4,gallegomeca,21/07/2023,We slept luxuriously and for a great breakfast a little unevenness
110276,2630266,4,gedo,30/03/2023,Excellent spot for the night to recommend. In the middle of summer there will surely be a lot of people.
110276,2603059,4,Wunderkinder,08/03/2023,"The place is quite a dream, loads of tables and benches, bbqs, full of nature, beautiful flowers, lots of grass, beautiful trees and the standing space is adequate, albeit quite sloping. But the square is very busy and really crowded on the weekends, there are a lot of celebrations, walkers, hikers and more here, you won't get any more space, it's full to the brim."
110276,2587334,5,StephanieO,22/02/2023,"We spent the night with no worries, it was very quiet and we found a flat place to park. Start of beautiful hikes."
110276,2586790,4,travelbursuki,22/02/2023,"Great place for picnic, you can make the bonfire in the grill place if it's not summer, BUT It's actually forbidden to sleep there."
110276,2585485,5,BineBriidi,21/02/2023,For me the quietest place in a long time. Nice hiking area
110276,2571712,4,Carapat,08/02/2023,"nice and quiet spot on recreational area with tables and barbecues, hiking trails. We were able to go there with a converted coach and a car carrier. Slightly sloping parking lot"
110276,2537915,4,Hadini,02/01/2023,"Beautiful large place, with good hiking opportunities. Very busy during the day. At 2 a.m. a car came, people got out and drove again after 30 minutes. Fine for one night"
110276,2522639,4,NicoleZKen,16/12/2022,Nice and quiet place. We had a quiet night here. In the morning all the cows came to the fence because the farmer came to bring straw. Unfortunately a lot of dirt despite 3 large containers. Join us and make the world a little cleaner. An hour of getting dirty helps a lot! Thanks in advance!
110276,2426114,4,CaillouOnTheRoad,06/10/2022,"The place is really nice, in the nature but some cars came around midnight to do I don’t know what so it can be a bit stressful but nothing happened."
110276,2422448,5,DavidRhye,04/10/2022,"Great big location, so lots of private spots. hike nearby to the dam and have a quiet swim in paradise with eagles flying overhead. does seem to have some shady cars coming and going at night, but no issues"
110276,2387993,4,misterbliebloe,20/09/2022,"Lots of picnic tables, you can park in the shade of cork trees. No interdiction sign for parking at night. Entrance for a natural reserve, far from a big road so very quiet. Seems to be a bit of a spot for young locals to meet at night but they don't bother no one.
Safe and great spot. Ideal for looking at the stars.  No police."
110276,1906494,4,CarlosDuran,22/05/2022,"We have slept 1 night, a very calm, quiet place, away from circulation and clean. The beautiful setting. During the day families come to the picnic area, there are many squares, at night we were alone, the whole area to ourselves. There are many squares, you have to level, and the dogs have been free. Very close to the highway and gas station. Ideal to rest between trips."
110276,1838284,4,hemart67,19/04/2022,"quiet, barbecue areas beautiful surroundings, sloping parking areas."
110276,1809227,5,ririfred,07/04/2022,One of the nicest spots we’ve parked on! Great for bird-watching. We stayed here 2 nights. Los Alcornocales is a fantastic national park.

110276,1751953,5,beaaguirre,10/02/2022,We have spent a perfect night! Just a couple of cars that passed through the night but nothing more. The area is full of picnic areas and green! It is true that if the area is very busy there are few level spaces but it was not our case. We will be back!
110276,1542679,4,eseperroverde,03/09/2021,Fantastic place to spend a few days. It is a fairly large parking lot (not very flat) surrounded by lots of tables and barbecues. We slept for two days. In the morning some people with dogs pass by and in the afternoon several hikers. No water or shops nearby. For dogs 10/10.
110276,1055992,3,Basq,18/09/2020,Known as Montera del Torero viewpoint.   Great for watching birds of prey migrating south to the straits of Gibraltar and Africa.  Good phone signal.  Biting flies a  menace. Not much level ground
110276,774589,5,thesoaperi,31/01/2020,"Really nice picnic area, away from the main road so no noise, there are tables and barbecues (no fires from May to September!), Nice walks! 2 very peaceful nights"

110292,1066469,2,beaaguirre,23/09/2020,"After a rather winding road, the place did not seem cozy at all. Set aside on one side of the same road with nothing more than a mountain view."

110292,430897,5,barou,18/02/2019,Small area very practical. Calm assured even if the road is near. We are in nature. Beautiful walks or hikes depending on the form to do. I recommend for a break or a night :)

There are orchards next door and we have been listening to dogs all night long and when we wake up more dogs and they don't stop. Anyway. Parking not recommended. Ahh... And the road right next to it, but wow, that's the least annoying thing."
110301,2058204,4,RanganCaddy,10/07/2022,"Very quiet, we were alone all night, it is in the middle of the road that is little traveled at night. It has no wastebasket or fountain, separated from the colonizing towns."
110301,1849774,5,Ederest,24/04/2022,"We were already in 2020 with our Dokker with a bed. Now we have returned with our Movano camperized and everything is just as good. Nature, tranquility and good accessibility. This time if more people have come to sleep. Up to 4 campers and motorhomes. Last time I didn't mention the restaurant across the street, where you can order a coffee or have breakfast. Less than 1km services for motorhomes and the town."

Everything but flat, not quiet and if you are unlucky you have to stand next to the Parking on the road. And that in November. looks dirty. The lady of the Cafe rinses her mop out in the water No thanks, haven't seen us again, it's certainly not worth the detour there."
110339,1649442,5,andreasliebe,17/10/2021,"Small quiet place. The thermal bath can now be used again. Between 22 and 24 degrees warm, very clear and pleasant. 2 restaurants were open, one with an outdoor area under vines. You stand very quietly by shady trees, diagonally across from the small chapel. In the neighboring town of Tijola very good free VE with good drinking water. Better to choose the western approach through gardens and plantations."

110400,2572745,5,JoelVadrouille,09/02/2023,"Yes, the terrain is not perfect, but other than that...nothing to complain about. Towards this side of Granada, there are not many places to park without being bothered by bad smells. Work is underway at the thermal baths but does not start until around 8:30 a.m. That night, we were 2 CCs."

110400,433514,5,PeterIris,25/02/2019,"Great place to spent a quiet day and night (low season !). Flat parking up, or more slopy but more beautiful parking following the road. Unfortunately the natural baths are closed in low season (and are more or less a swimming pool). Don't know how busy it can get in summer when the baths are open, but should be still good to spent the night as the baths close at 8pm."
110403,1028263,4,el-zahori,05/09/2020,"Very interesting place due to the presence of a fir forest, water and certain endemic species, as well as the landscape. But it is not a recommended area for large motorhomes, as it is accessed by a 13 km dirt track from the south (Lucar). From the north (Cullar Baza) I don't recommend it for AC. Be careful, it is a fragile place, no groups."
110403,752717,1,samlele,11/12/2019,"It should be specified which route you took with a motorhome, in any case it is very pretty but arriving from the South, pay attention and plan which way to go because the google maps routes are bad and often lead to unpleasant surprises . Basically a big hassle and again we have a van."

110416,1188186,5,Judith81,08/05/2021,We have spent the night here and great! There is to fill clean water and empty dirty water for free. There are trucks staying the night tb. The breakfast is very good and well priced and if you have dogs like us it is a great place because it has field around to take them out for a walk.

110418,2182152,3,gloriavandita,06/08/2022,"We have parked several times in this car park, always during the month of July and we have not had any problems. The area is somewhat dirty and there is a lot of movement during the afternoon of people who go for a walk or walk their dogs. On one occasion the local police told us that there was no problem staying overnight if it was just one night. Tip: have a muffin with colored butter for breakfast at Pizarro :)"

110426,2867786,5,ElizabethBM,18/06/2023,"It is a medium open space next to the hermitage, for 2 or 3 vans or not very large caravans. The access road is narrow and to enter you have to maneuver a bit and go down a small ramp in reverse, but we had no problems. The views are beautiful, there are no services or to leave the garbage. Very quiet night."

Especially thanks for this place, so peaceful and beautiful… the stars in the night, the sun going up and the playground for the kid and hikes in the area :) Just a reminder, pick up your garbage and especially toilet paper- how difficult can it be?!"
110426,2576040,5,MarioFarlete,12/02/2023,"Last 50 meters of road complicated for AC or GV, but without problems for vans. We deviated a bit from the route to eat quietly and we loved it. Perfect place to spend a night."

110426,1835795,1,manuelanu,18/04/2022,"Totally occupied by 5 local cars having a picnic there. The location is very difficult to access on the last 10 meters, only doable by van I think. Otherwise yes the view is magnificent."
110426,1777810,5,lifeo8,08/03/2022,"Great spot! Super calm, no car passing by, just dog walkers or mountain bikers, a breathtaking view and the feeling of being alone in the world. Yet there are houses nearby but not glued to the spot. The village of Masarbones is a 2km walk away and very cute, you have to follow the saludable route signs and you're there!"
110426,1701795,5,Hommelleider,02/12/2021,"Very secluded and not easy of acces, but totally worth it once you get there!"
110426,1561679,4,amygrace,09/09/2021,"A great place, but as others have said the last 100 metres to enter are very rocky, particularly last 20 metres - in the end we parked just above rather than entering. To turn to enter would be a complicated (we have a 6 metre van), though not impossible! Great views and very quiet, no one except a dog walker morning & evening."
110426,1397767,5,MarieJeff,03/08/2021,"Very nice place, quiet, with a beautiful view over the valley. The site is large, very flat and shaded. the path leading there is limited passable but it goes with a small van."
110426,1221541,3,Anto95,27/05/2021,"Pros: nice view, ample parking and with a historic church (closed) next to it. Cons: dirt road to get there with large stones in the ground and differences in height, the access ramp to the parking lot is challenging, narrow and steep. Come if you have a small van and you want a quiet and isolated place in nature but avoid if you don't feel safe driving in difficult environments"
110426,1180363,5,AlinaJoannaZoe1331,26/04/2021,Peaceful spot with.. heard some hunters at night but otherwise total silence. The road is a little rocky to get here but nothing within the impossible. Only the entrance to the flat paved parking is quit steep and narrow. Would recommend it for motorhomes.
110426,1109664,5,JanezBanic,30/10/2020,"Really peaceful place with a very nice view. A few dog walkers in the morning, otherwise you are alone.

110426,776103,5,PhilippSanchez,04/02/2020,"A little out of the way, but a clear recommendation! Rather what for Vams and not for WoMos because the access is narrow and bumpy. The view and tranquility always pays off. One of the most beautiful places."
110427,2457341,4,du_ni,23/10/2022,You can park here right by the sea and there are no prohibition signs. About 15 minutes walk to the nearest restaurants. View of Fuerteventura.
110427,740496,4,MLISE,09/11/2019,We also came only for lunch and shower in the wind and that's cool. 2 days in a row because the lighthouse protects us well and the view on the coast is really nice. Many walkers. Just do not look at the lighthouse that leaves something to be desired.

110428,2545641,1,walsch,07/01/2023,the place is ok during the day .... completely unsuitable for overnight stays in the main because of the loud permanent barking of 2 dogs. The mutts hang around so close that earplugs don't help anymore

110428,2451647,3,frajomima,19/10/2022,"As detailed. Esplanade of earth and gravel. No services. Ideal large vehicles. Near the town and with beautiful views.

110428,1181625,2,kasparjuvenalis,29/04/2021,"Unfortunately, the parking lot is completely unusable as a place to sleep, as there is heavy traffic there very early in the morning. The only positive thing about it is the proximity to the city, which, however, also means that you are led through the narrow streets when you arrive, which is really no fun above a certain length."
110428,1127914,4,angela1978,04/01/2021,"Perfect to visit antequera, everything is close by. We slept one night and it is true that there are some dogs next door that were a bit annoying and the traffic noise as soon as the morning begins. it is not the quietest place"

110429,2740905,5,Roonoo,11/05/2023,By far the best place we have found! Very quiet and there is a water fountain and bins. The police do not come to bother you unlike the parking lot next to the beach.
110429,2730792,4,LaGriotte,07/05/2023,"Probably the coolest spot around town. Not far on foot from its castle and the city center. Many dog walkers and a small guinguette in the evening in front of the Ermita but the people are nice and it remains calm.

110429,2561377,3,Wunderkinder,27/01/2023,"We were approached by the police on the second day. Might stay another night after polite questions but I think one night would be better. The driveway is a horror for larger vehicles from some streets. Don't trust maps, please see which road is better. Trash cans are more than enough available. There is sun and shadow."
110429,2489547,5,MaxiSole,10/11/2022,"A great, quiet place. We spent 2 nights here. The highway could be heard a bit, but we didn't find it disturbing. The police drove daily patrol, but were friendly. Thank you for this wonderful place, please keep it clean, the walkers and dog lovers thank you."

110429,1995250,5,Rubylicious,20/06/2022,"The place is very nice for one night, you stand on the mountain with luck there is a mild breeze and you can see the sea. There are public toilets and you can dispose of your garbage. The restaurant is open until late in the evening and in the morning there are many dog walkers.

Beware of the ground full of potholes and boulders, and above with low branches. The best access is from the town itself along a wide paved road with a slight slope. The cleaning people from the town hall came and didn't say anything."

110429,1750948,2,Lambretta75,08/02/2022,A pretty steep climb. Nothing for large mobile homes. We didn't spend the night there. To get to the back you have a good chance of scratching the RV on the trees. Front too small and crooked. The place nearby is very nice and worth a walk.

110429,1720275,5,TalesOfMarola,30/12/2021,"Super picturesque and quiet spot on top of a hill, next to a beautiful old chapel (which also has a restaurant). Best place to park is behind the chapel. The area is more flat. On the side is quite bumpy. No services, but there is a picknick area with some bins to dispose garbage. Good for a night’s stay! Also, the police drove past twice and didn’t even say anything."

110429,1552836,4,Altsasu,06/09/2021,"A great place to sleep in peace and quiet near the old town of Altafulla (10min, back with a steep slope). At the end of August we slept in 2 vans. During the day the people of the village go to the hermitage for a walk or a drink at the bar, but once the night is over it is a very quiet place. Tables, grills (closed) and trash cans are available."

110429,1226296,4,izarbeangel,30/05/2021,"We were on a Saturday to sleep. All good, except that some young people came in a car and they were about an hour with music at full volume. Then they turned off and left and we were able to rest. The place is very good, somewhat dirty in the surroundings because of the papers that people leave when they go to piss. And that there are containers in the hermitage."

The guys are nice, but emptying black and gray water next to cleaning dishes is not the most pleasant. The services left but who uses them even worse. The price for such raised."

The bread was old and hard. The staff was friendly. I can not confirm these good reviews here. €16 for three people without electricity!
110431,2674685,5,beaglewheeler,16/04/2023,"Well that's a great pitch! Super nice service, great food in a great clean pool. The complex is nicely divided and very well maintained. You can also buy vegetables, eggs, wine and cheese in the shop and the fresh baguette is super delicious. The journey was unproblematic if you don't use the sat nav. You just have to pay attention to the signs! No problem for large vehicles either."
110431,2666365,4,Tremenda,13/04/2023,"A very pleasant stay. A close and very friendly treatment. Close to Cartagena to visit it, and near the Sierra de la Muela Cabo Tiñoso and Roldán, where we made a beautiful route to Castillitos. Gravel route or mountain bike. You can also go up to Castillitos by car."
110431,2643481,5,AngieLu,06/04/2023,A place that won't let you leave so quickly. It was heavenly calm and the chirping of the birds was wonderful. The homemade fresh baguette every morning is legendary. And the other food was delicious too. I was extremely enthusiastic about the energetic massage offered and it also moved me. I would be happy to come back here another time. The people there are also unique.

110431,2601856,2,isagermaine,07/03/2023,Good but really far from any shops less than 10 km away the bus is 3.5 km away wasteland as a nice location yes but that's all the photo is misleading and very expensive and moreover I do not accept to pay 2€ per animal
110431,2599878,2,voyageur835,05/03/2023,"excellent welcome, the place is very nice, very pleasant and the bus to Cartagena is nearby (2 to 3 km). the churros and chocolate are excellent. the toilets are a bit old but need to be renovated. Very good stopover to visit Cartagena."

Possibility of meals in the Cafeteria, car rental, meditation, yoga, Taï Chi, massages. Cafeteria, car rental, and massage tested and approved. If we pass by here we will definitely come back."
110431,2595148,4,leptitjp,01/03/2023,"Very quiet, very beautiful, very friendly staff. Lack of shower Wc and washing machine, but there are others under construction. The access is indeed narrow but we passed with our 8m30 long. It is rather the shrubs along the small road that affect the bodywork on each side, but only micro scratches. On the area, be careful, even the large spaces are not all suitable for people over 3m high under the trees. To leave we preferred the other way. Indeed there is a very large puddle, and not due to the rain, rather a broken drain. It is a passable dirt road with no shrubs, but we hit some branches at the house just before finding the paved road."
110431,2577564,5,uwepimpl,14/02/2023,"For the 2nd time in 4 months we are on the beautiful finca. It offers everything we as campers expect from a pitch. The sanitary facilities are simple but very clean. The shop and the restaurant are open 12 hours. The leisure activities such as yoga, energetic massages and guided meditations are exceptional. The team is always available and happy to help with problems."

110431,2576642,5,FalconFin,13/02/2023,Nice place with lovely staff. The price- quality ratio is good and The location is in a quiet environment. The showers and toilets are clean and hot waters certainly doesn't run our on the shower or at the sink. You don't need coins in the shower - you just turn on the tap. Hiking and bike paths start at the gate. Nice bar and shop in the area.
110431,2576018,1,Trevorwest,12/02/2023,"Not the best of places, facilities disgusting. Advised us on arrival that new toilets/showers were under construction but did not think the current ones would be so awful. Don’t follow the sign posted exit to AP7 when leaving if it’s been raining you will get stuck in the mud along the track. This place is in the middle of no where and it is not cheap stop."

Sanitary facilities in the container, not so great, but new ones will probably be built. Restaurant offers many organic dishes."

WiFi is fine in the camper where we were so that we could watch TV ourselves, we did not notice any faltering power. Now about the sanitary facilities, hang a fresh shower curtain for a few euros with the gentlemen and a new shower head that does not always fall off."
110431,2566184,5,SueTe,02/02/2023,"A very special place! Lots of rest, nice people. Clean, well organized. Whether ""right in the middle"" or outside in the large open space - the right spot for every requirement. Ruben and his team are warm, dedicated young people"
110431,2564997,1,dineX,31/01/2023,"When you look at the pictures you expect something different than what you find when entering the bathroom! Selling spaces within very narrow, on the more pleasant outdoor area unfortunately only partial power supply possible. In the morning we drove directly to another pitch without using the bathrooms and washing machine."
110431,2560942,3,aljnorton,26/01/2023,"We actually stayed outside on some open ground as they were really busy when we arrived. It was actually more pleasant there to be honest. It was really crowded inside and had very basic facilities.

The staff were pleasant enough and there were plenty of places to walk around the site. The city is fabulous and a visit to the ruins is a must. 

Expensive for experience."

But the organic cafeteria and the whole wellness concept of this finca are great and we will be happy to come back. Very nice staff."
110431,2552628,5,3aufReisen,15/01/2023,"Wonderfully green. When we were there the lemon trees were bearing fruit in abundance. Gravel soil throughout and no dust, at least within the enclosure. €13 for an overnight stay. Graduated discount for stays of 2 nights or more. Not too much for the plant. We were treated courteously and fairly."

110431,2548598,5,ak3921,10/01/2023,We were there over New Year's Eve and felt very comfortable. The place is quiet and exudes good energy. Long-term campers and transit guests mix. We particularly liked the vegetarian menu and the small organic shop. It is very quiet at night and you can make beautiful hikes there.

Thanks for us!"
110431,2511220,5,rallyfreewind,02/12/2022,A quiet dream. Solo travelers are left alone and the area invites you to explore. A place with strong energy. The operators are always there for you and always help. I will gladly come again.

110431,2324620,2,CANB,31/08/2022,"we have been there for a weekend, the places are small for a 7.5 m AC so you have to take a large place for €25 per day, the pool seems to be fine but when you enter it you realize that it is quite run down and tiles a bit lacking in cleanliness. The worst thing is the toilet to empty the colt that is attached to the sink. Very run down bathrooms."
110431,2266782,5,mrsknight4life,19/08/2022,"Lovely little site abit off a track road but not very long we have a large camper 9 meters long and we were fine. Staff very lovely and helpful.

A grocery store with everything you need from bread, pastries even some products for cc. Spacious pitches, snack bar at reasonable prices, a menu that changes every day tapas and pizzas at the top.

In our opinion the place is lovely and wonderful and for the price totally worth it. Friendly staff who tries really hard to make us feel at home. Such a pity that some people destroy this natural place and nice atmosphere with their behavior but that's a society problem and not Finca Alegría's."

Wifi good but electricity supply can be intermittent, largely due to demand.

Shower with hot water, wifi, you can also do laundry (laundry and dryer cost 3.5€ each but if you buy it together it costs 6€) or buy coffe or food in restaurant. It seems to be in the middle of nowhere but you can feel close to nature in this place - waking up to the sound of singing birds is pretty amazing ;)"

They also have a restaurant which you are very excited about."
110431,1739863,3,eriba697,23/01/2022,Isolated and in the countryside. Calm assured but access is difficult. You can rent a car for Cartagena. It seems more interesting to book at the campsite north of the city
110431,1739196,4,nomad187,22/01/2022,"Super stopover and peaceful surroundings. Showers and toilets need updating. There seems to be a big electrical wiring problem, electricity cuts out regularly and there is not enough current to supply the fridge if everybody is using electric, so fridge switches to gas, other electrical appliances only operate at part power. Power surges when electric comes back on after cut outs."
110431,1736288,5,didiernoni,18/01/2022,"Hello, there are some who are never happy. The area is perfect, secure, yes perhaps the men's showers need to be reviewed. The area is right in the middle of the almond trees which are in bloom this season, it's magnificent. beautiful mountain bike rides 6 kms from the sea by the paths and 10kms from catagene. perfect telephone reception and free wifi. on-site catering, terrace bar in front of the beautiful swimming pool"

110431,1729303,5,TomUlli,07/01/2022,"Hello, we stayed at the finca for a month again in December. All the people were very friendly and the owners are friendly and very helpful. The price was very good, with a 30-day stay it was 270 euros for 2 people with electricity. The place is good, the view is great. Please all dog owners, keep the area outside clean, as other people are still walking"
110431,1727981,5,KaPe54,06/01/2022,"The operators are very friendly and always helpful. The pitches are small to large, depending on your choice. Sanitary areas are simple, but always clean.

110431,1722409,1,BimobilOnTour,01/01/2022,"Despite prior reservation of a place, which was confirmed, we had to stand outside in the forecourt in the middle of a lot of dog poo. Everything was jam-packed and overcrowded, far too few showers for the masses, and they looked rather provisional. And then ask for € 23, without electricity or other service for this parking space - next time I prefer to stand at a gas station."
110431,1718848,2,merten,29/12/2021,"On the pitch's website, the price for one night from 15.09. until June 15 indicated at € 13.00. When we took our assigned place on December 28th, 21st, the place suddenly cost € 23.00. The reason are the days between Christmas and New Year. Due to this non-transparent pricing policy, we drove to another parking space the following day."
110431,1716993,4,MARGIL,27/12/2021,"It is a quiet place surrounded by nature. Could deserve 5 stars if an effort in the quality was made for the toilet space (a little too basic), garbage space (often crowded), night lighting (too dark). For those who love nature and tranquility quite recommended."
110431,1714899,5,DeNiiiiiice,23/12/2021,"Highly Recommended. If you are looking for peace, friendly and helpful hosts and a relaxed atmosphere on a safe parking space, this is the right place for you. We stood here for 5 nights in early December. The finca is a bit away from shops. But lovingly prepared dishes, bread fresh from the oven every day and a small shop on the premises provide catering."
110431,1713876,5,RolandoChristina,21/12/2021,"We felt very comfortable. A colorful international mix of friendly people was gathered here. The very best was the food; it is very good vegetarian cuisine. The sanitary facilities are a bit older and also cool in winter. Very friendly, young team."
110431,1710610,5,myskay,15/12/2021,We were here for 11 days and we really enjoyed it. Very nice people. We especially liked the peace and quiet and the landscape. Good P / L ratio. Highly Recommended. The men's toilet / shower should be better.
110431,1702781,5,TDausend,04/12/2021,What a beautiful oasis of calm this is. Super nice and relaxed people at the reception. Very sunny place with gravel plots of different sizes. A great range of regional organic products and delicious tapas. You can also indulge in the massages from time to time. I definitely remember the place.
110431,1699940,5,PerfiladaLyfe,29/11/2021,"Very acceptable price and great deal. You have the option of doing yoga and meditation in addition to other activities they offer. Pool open all year round and very quiet place. The only thing is that the exit they advise when it rains gets regular with the mud, but you can go out where you enter and hopefully you will not find a car in front of you."
110431,1699216,4,correkaminos,28/11/2021,"It is a private estate that has decided in its facilities to accommodate motorhome tourism, very quiet and great treatment. They give the option of renting a car for a small price which makes it easier for you to get to know the area without needing the motorhome."
110431,1695612,5,RSX2020,22/11/2021,"Very nice welcome, peaceful and clean place. Massage are highly recommended. Thank you, we will be back."

110431,1677710,5,camperlovers,04/11/2021,"We think this is a nice, quiet place with very friendly owners. Delicious food! Really recommended. Excellent sanitary facilities, hot & cold shower, spacious pitches. Nice that there is a pool. Wonderfully quiet, no barking dogs, no road, thousands of stars to see in the evening .... Good WiFi, also in the camper. Nice little shop with organic products. go vegan"
110431,1674856,5,Ikorni,02/11/2021,"Very good communication from the first call. Reception 9 am-10pm. All questions are allowed and answered in a very friendly manner. Clear space. Pool for children is fantastic. Sanitary very clean, showers hot, food very good. Fresh bread in the morning. Children very welcome. Operators speak several languages and wait patiently if you want to order in a foreign language. Very fair prices."
110431,1673987,5,Didi1961,01/11/2021,"Stayed there for 2 days. Hosts super friendly, toilet and showers clean, nice pool, small restaurant recommended. Very quiet, in the middle of nowhere. The bike path to the beach is a bit difficult to find, very hilly, partly gravel roads, tip: leave the parking space to the right according to the exit sign. Then after a short while you come to the asphalt path. Be sure to take provisions with you."
110431,1671720,5,bevaskew,31/10/2021,"Very impressed! €60 for 5 nights including electric (low season). Peaceful, away from it all which is just what we needed.  Nice pool, we loved our daily swim! A decent sized pitch, slightly tricky to get into.  Good facilities and very affordable food and drink. The road is fine, I'm not sure why some reviews were negative, we've certainly been on a lot worse!! Well done Espacia Finca Alegria!"
110431,1665857,5,SyFri,28/10/2021,"Magical, friendly, calm, fantastic"
110431,1663413,2,francoise1775,26/10/2021,"Not easy for large CC with trailer but not impossible after a few fears. In times of health crisis, cleaning was not done daily. Fortunately the bins were emptied a little more often because we had the right to the overflow of maggots. We appreciated a large location the 16 amps but not the few sleepless nights due to noise. Ruben comments are constructive"
110431,1662596,5,pinelmarieange,26/10/2021,Answer to nonoplonge you are not going back just pass in front of you must not put such derogatory comments
110431,1661751,1,Nonoplongee,25/10/2021,If you want to risk scratching or breaking good luck help to access it with a big cc
110431,1661026,5,pinelmarieange,25/10/2021,We have been coming for three years and it is always a pleasure. the place is quiet clean the owners are very welcoming the pitches are large enough the water and electricity terminals on all 16 amp plots. drinks at the bar are inexpensive bread and catering on site around the pool or take away vehicle rent on site we are 15 minutes from Cartagena
110431,1659419,2,martine40,24/10/2021,"Idyllic place when we arrived .... but we quickly realize that we are isolated from everything, advice to have a means of locomotion. sanitary man very average ... the local trash leaves as desired .... when in the restaurant more than limited. very good but the service to be reviewed, forgetting in the order ...... the surrounding dogs howl all night long to sum up we are disappointed"
110431,1657503,5,Elsmon,23/10/2021,"The place is great! It deserves 10 stars. The place is lovingly, cozy and well thought out. Sanitary facilities in containers - simple, but perfectly adequate and clean. The employees are extremely nice and motivated. Everything is as in the description. We were very happy about this place."
110431,1651278,5,HectorHoose,18/10/2021,"Lovely site, still open (big bonus!), including the pool, bar & restaurant but remains a small, quiet & rural site which is utterly perfect! Only €11 per night (for 2 nights - gets cheaper the longer you stay) without electricity. Road in is narrow & rough but perfectly drivable in our 7.5m van. Lots of extra bonus’s like hire car to explore nearby Cartagena, fresh daily bread & even a massage if you fancy!"
110431,1646874,5,valentintin,16/10/2021,"We stayed 3 nights and enjoyed it very much. The operators are very nice and try hard. There was enough space, the surroundings are beautiful and the food tastes really good - compliments to the kitchen :) (and a lot of it is even organic, which we very much appreciate!). Entry and exit with a 6m Ducato absolutely problem-free. A vehicle is advantageous for excursions, but a car can be rented on site."
110431,1636634,5,fincaalegria,10/10/2021,"Responding to ""mariepierrel"": The access is tarred !! The exit, yes, it is 2km of gravel and dry land. We are less than 10km from ""everything"". We also have very cheap car rentals. Nature is “everything” for us. And here we have all the services! The beach is 6 km away! Yes! By car 10.5 km. In the men's restroom, we just added a screen"
110431,1635255,3,mariepierrel,09/10/2021,Dirt road to access the area !! a means of transport is absolutely necessary when the camper van is installed because it is far from everything. Attention beach at 11 km and not 6 as it is noted on the app. Men's sanitary facilities in the works !!! not very well thought out locations. pleasant swimming pool.
110431,1628072,4,ipvb,05/10/2021,"We stayed here overnight with a camper and dog. Good atmosphere and delicious food. Nice campsite and will definitely return if in the area. The road to get there is a bit scary, but doable. Kindly received"

110431,1616100,5,fincaalegria,29/09/2021,"In reply to ""jpaulstb"": Dear friends, when it rains mud it is normal, we are in nature. But anyone can get there, the road is asphalt anyway. If they wanted to eat, they just had to communicate it to reception or by phone, it's very simple! 23 € is the exclusive price of ONE NIGHT IN SUMMER, all inclusive, with the swimming pool."
110431,1615903,3,jpaulstb,29/09/2021,"Good friendly welcome but difficult to access especially since it had rained, very muddy path. nice swimming pool, clean but tinkered toilets, we wanted to eat in the restaurant ... saw no one. the land is not well maintained, it is in the middle of nowhere. 23 euros without electricity seems very expensive to us."
110431,1600396,5,PacoTabaco,22/09/2021,"A very quiet place to rest. They have a swimming pool, small bathrooms, a bit old but clean, a small shop for organic products and a restaurant. The people at the campsite are very nice. One camper, two people, € 23"
110431,1582598,5,txipironsobreruedas,16/09/2021,"Magical, unusual and charming place. A calm and quiet oasis between Cartagena and Mazarrón. To say that we went to spend the night on our way to Mojácar, and we stayed for a week .... Finca Alegría has reactivated all our senses that remained asleep as a result of stress and routines. Thank you for creating this space and making us feel so happy. She-wolf, Cao ❤️"
110431,1560883,5,TRAGAMILLAS,09/09/2021,"An oasis in the middle of the desert, very peaceful place, very good baths, a large pool perfect for the heat, good place we will return"
110431,1531446,5,finansierra,30/08/2021,Good place to rest. Pool open until night in case you want to bathe. Plots with water and electricity. EYE with an olive tree inside the enclosure that you may take it with you. Vegan shop and food. To enter one way and exit another. Entrance by road about 1200 meters from the road. Not to be confused with the one at the foot of the road.
110431,1528218,5,CaptainBiggles,29/08/2021,Had a very pleasant stay there 2 years ago. A brilliant small site with excellent facilities and a very warm welcome. Lovely owners and a very helpful Manageress with excellent English spoken.
110431,1519874,5,fincaalegria,27/08/2021,"In reply to ""bubunco"": The place is in nature. We make it easy to hire a cheap vehicle. The road is suitable for vehicles up to 12 meters. If you got stuck with another large vehicle, you were going in the opposite direction, because there is one way to come and another to exit. Reducing our entire campsite to the men's washroom is a huge exaggeration."
110431,1516798,5,choquito,26/08/2021,"I discovered this place by chance and it is highly recommended if you are in the area to make a stop. Very clean, the pool is great and the menu for lunch or dinner is simple but very good value for money The couple who run it are lovely, They know how to treat customers"

Perfect attention and the facilities more than good, swimming pool included, I recommend trying the homemade and organic food, which they prepare with great care. a pleasant surprise. If we go back there I will not hesitate to return. Humor and good vibes are also guaranteed."
110431,1493636,3,bubunco,21/08/2021,"Warm welcome, surrounded by nature. Compulsory means of transport, relatively isolated. Difficult access with motorhome over 7m, because it is not possible to pass each other. Personal experience because we passed a motorhome and we hung up. Pitches difficult to access. Price a little excessive in view of the services (dilapidated men's showers) El Portus Beach 11kms"

In a super environment and with services that almost nobody offers you, they even rent you a stroller so as not to move the caravan. A young couple giving themselves over to their project! and they do very nice activities"

We were there for 4 days in which we took the opportunity to rent the car for hours and be able to go to coves where it is difficult to go with the motorhome, we ate the menu of the day that is made with looooong love and of course we enjoyed the pool. There is some shade and the wind was blowing so we were able to cope with the heat ...."

Anyway, they came here, and we weren't there, and they called and we told them we were under construction, but they could come in if they needed anything. We're sorry this was your response."
110431,1263995,3,Ramona_,19/06/2021,Mega friendly and lovely staff. But unfortunately the sanitary facilities and the place are extremely dirty and neglected. a pity. It could be so beautiful.

110431,1119402,5,fincaalegria,05/12/2020,"We denounced the above comment. Rating left after 5 days. Why did he stay here so long if there are much better ones nearby? And why is he lying with hatred? Everyone tells us that the place is beautiful. The water comes out very hot. Tomatoes, from 1.35 € / kg. Trash can be full for a moment, but empties immediately. Why are you lying?"
110431,1117049,2,Machu,22/11/2020,"Very disappointed, the photos do not reflect reality. Yes, nice pool ... but everything else is DIY with salvage and the comments are kind! Showers almost cold at the end of November, cobbled together toilets, overflowing garbage cans ... There is much better a few kilometers away. Unbeatable prices? Tomatoes at 3.50 euros per kilo! In short, we have seen better, much better for the same prices."

110431,796728,5,vanwanderesses,20/03/2020,Beautiful place with pretty much everything that you need. (Except black and greywater station) The owners are really friendly and allowed us to stay during the quarantine. We are still here and the gates are still open in case you need a place that is safe and has all the facilities you need. Because it is in between fields and right next to a hiking area there is a lot of space to walk your dog and don’t break your quarantine. There is also a tiny store on the campground selling organic food from the area.
110431,792037,3,SonjaGruendler,07/03/2020,"Waste water disposal and rubbish disposal were missing. 1 toilet / shower on the upper floor. Space is not ready, but operators are nice. The nicest thing is the pool."
110431,782082,4,jonkil,17/02/2020,"A beautiful rustic Finca with fantastic owners. Great parking, all with electric and water. Walking among the almonds and the citrus orchards is fantastic. Bathrooms/kitchens/WiFi/pool/public areas are superb. Would be 5 stars if grey/black water disposal point was commissioned. One of the best stops we had in Spain and we will return. Simply excellent."
110431,781787,4,sylser,17/02/2020,"Very relaxing place, friendly welcome, surrounded by nature. We will come back!"
110431,773914,5,claufran,29/01/2020,"Stage planned for 1 or 2 nights, but stayed 5! Space, friendly welcome, cleanliness, services and extra price! Walks around the finca between almond and olive trees, by bike to the village to eat tapas, by car to visit Cartagena. And everything is said! We will be back with pleasure! Thanks to the owners!"
110431,773335,4,Janve,27/01/2020,"I do not put 5 stars because the emptying of gray water is directly non-existent, otherwise the site and facilities are perfect, they facilitate the stay by putting showers, sinks, microwaves and washing machine service for € 2 at your disposal, they have activities and a small restaurant with option for vegetarians, swimming pool open all year. Undoubtedly recommended, yes, try to solve the issue of emptying gray water? the access road is not impossible but it has its point of complicated, somewhat narrow and a bit bumpy but it arrives without problem."
110431,726121,5,SDF24,20/10/2019,"Everything has been said, but I want to thank the owners of this place because we feel really good, with everything we need. Change of scenery, friendly welcome and very reasonable price! It is better to have a motorcycle or other to visit Cartagena and surroundings. A few flies at the moment but like everywhere in these regions right now!"
110431,699081,4,solvitav,21/09/2019,"Great price, nice pool. A place in the middle of nowhere. The WiFi was too weak even pretty close to the reception. Toilets and showers, however, were nice and clean. Just some organization overall seems lacking. Grey water emptying just outside over the soil."
110431,677260,3,pichy,05/09/2019,"The intention is good but they need to finish adapting it, greatly improve the emptying of blacks and grays and not think that with a pool everything is done."
110431,675322,5,thiemari,03/09/2019,"Very nice place, very good home, gray water, black water, electricity and a real bathroom (not like camping), all very clean and as a bonus a superb pool. All this for 12 euros, we spent 2 nights just 2 motorhomes. We strongly recommend it"

110431,662355,5,EliyDani,27/08/2019,"Very quiet place with all services, even has a pool. A lot of television channels are taken. Located in the countryside but close to everything. The road seems complicated but we have passed without problems with a Capuchin motorhome. Large plots, flat and spacious to maneuver. Great treatment by the owners. Very well! PS the entrance is at the end of the farm."
110431,657122,4,cesc,24/08/2019,"Good vegetarian food, good treatment of the owner, spectacular pool and clean bathroom. Some service is missing but Rubén, the owner, told us that he would have them soon."

Would repeat"
110431,613420,4,Gemist,09/08/2019,Great Pza only access is a little weird. So do not distract from the visit. It's worth it. ?

No flies this day."

110431,566633,4,Luisfefurgo,21/07/2019,Nice and quiet place. Complicated access if you come from Mazarrón because Maps sends you on a road in poor condition. If you come from Cartagena you have no problem. The people who run the place are very friendly. They make your stay very easy and give you directions of all kinds. There is a shower room in very good condition. You can also use the fabulous swimming pools. We will repeat!
110431,558828,4,florent85,17/07/2019,"Access a little complicated, take the small paved road next to the car break and continue always straight very narrow but possible even with a vehicle of 10, for a possible vehicle in front to put on the side in the fields. As for the welcome the young couple is very friendly, and to finish if you like the silence ""three stars"" and to top it all a beautiful beautiful pool awaits you. (organic products at your disposal)"
110431,518825,5,Selli87,17/06/2019,"Highly Recommended!! Super friendly owner. Complete supply. You can buy wine and beer from the region. We are allowed to use everything. Only drawback disposal is far away from the pitch. Is still in the construction phase. Nevertheless, full marks"

110431,453661,5,bow89,13/04/2019,"Great peaceful place with very friendly hosts. They speak very good English too. We stayed here for 2 nights with our 2 children €15 euros a night - water, electric, toilets, showers, WiFi, very nice pool. Just take it slow on the road, it’s not as bad as previous comment says. Follow signs for Espacio Finca Alegría."
110431,448915,1,lisettelouis,04/04/2019,I come from this area. The path on 2 they is very bad impossible to duplicate.We could not get back because the donkey of the portal scraped the camper. The place seemed a bit weird I do not recommend it

110431,440871,5,cgim,17/03/2019,We received a very warm welcome from the young owners. We stayed here a little more or a month. You will really relax here. Several very well-kept bathrooms with toilets and showers are at your disposal. A very good base for cyclists (there are many calf bitters in between) and mountain bikers. You can walk to your heart's content among the almond groves. Cartagena is more than worth a visit ..... Thank you. We will definitely be back.
110431,437456,5,jack11120,07/03/2019,Home super. Young couple very helpful. Quiet and very pretty place. Sanitary irreproachable (nickel). Organic products for sale. Access not driveable and difficult the owner must remedy. To recommend

110435,3118951,4,Maxp0010,11/08/2023,"Rest area overlooking the sea and very close to the beach, 15 euros per day with van and 4 people (2 adults and 2 children) showers 1 euro for hot water. The bus leaves nearby and takes you to Malaga in about 1 hour. An hour's drive from Granada too, but we visited it with our own vehicle. Toilets and showers ok even if perhaps few for the number of pitches."
110435,3117188,5,mamaferrari_,10/08/2023,"Very good site. Very friendly receptionist, we arrived without a reservation and they took great care of us. The bathrooms very clean. There is a sink, washing machine, showers... you can empty and fill water. Sea views."

110435,2999952,5,cariass,22/07/2023,"The best in the area, the friendly and kind owners, the very complete area, the beach right next door, good gastronomy... Being a little elevated, the views are beautiful, this means that the noise from the road is not heard. Close to everything, Torrox and Nerja. This area has a special charm. We repeat every year."
110435,2857437,5,Bessi20,15/06/2023,Big recommendation! Great location (we heard absolutely nothing from the street) slightly elevated and therefore a great view of the sea. The owner is very nice and helpful. Sanitary facilities are always very clean. We felt so comfortable that we stayed longer than planned and at 13 euros a night it was absolutely fair!
110435,2836720,5,katuramu,09/06/2023,"it was great. hot showers are €1 for 5 minutes, but the cold water keeps running so if you need more time you can keep showering. the owner is really nice too!"
110435,2689203,1,elny,22/04/2023,"nice place, but noisy. I pay immediately, instructions only in German, excellent services, too bad they lock you in if you want to go out at eight you forget it. removed the padlock, the bar does not open, a German lady who was in the queue with us to go out (9 am) tel. in German and a guy arrives with the remote control, a cheeky smile who looks at me like I was running away and asks me if I had paid."
110435,2685441,5,DD9QE,21/04/2023,"Great place, nice owners! We stood here for 7 days. Unfortunately, the place is almost always fully booked, which is of course a good sign."

110435,2644904,4,enekoelenainigo,06/04/2023,"Good experience, although with details that would make it much better: in corner squares, you need kilometer cable for electricity, the bathrooms, showers and sinks are scarce and they do not have garbage, you have to take it outside. In addition, they have very little turnover, so they quickly outgrow it, there are too many people with long stays. I know it's not a campsite, but posts to improve and ask..."
110435,2619626,4,johnandjan,22/03/2023,"Aire with views of sea , much as already described plots to east get best sun and those with a sea view are best. Buses to Torrox and Nerja and Malaga can be a bit unreliable but just need a little patience Services all very clean"
110435,2609066,5,UrsulaJoist,14/03/2023,"Everything you need as a camper is there. Very clean sanitary, multilingual reception, restaurant and bus within walking distance, groceries 200m. Dogs allowed. There is also space for large campers. Operators do everything to make you feel comfortable. Brokerage of rental cars. Access to the pitches for large Womos a bit tricky but doable. Were here 3 times and keep coming back."
110435,2606424,1,chantaldante,12/03/2023,Complete area. We just did the gray and black water drains and water filling for 5€. A little expensive. Many are settled there for several weeks. What a pity !! We had to continue on our way.
110435,2551342,5,MarKer,14/01/2023,Super friendly hosts. Sensational view. Sanitary very clean. (The washing machine is here now.) V/E in order. Top connection to Malaga. Bus stop right in front of the door. Lots of long term campers.

110435,2360923,4,NicolasPais,11/09/2022,"Good site with parking in front of the sea. The only problem, the beach bar that is right in front with music until 3:00 AM. And having to leave the site the next day very soon (before 11:00)."
110435,2346849,4,juncris,06/09/2022,Good place to spend the night. We have been one night at the beginning of September. No noise from the bars or mess. It is also true that it has been the beginning of September and the topic of beach bars and such is totally dead! Very clean toilets and perfect for showering. €1 for hot water. They also bring you bread if you order it. Direct views of the sea. €15 a night!
110435,2336780,2,zyg,04/09/2022,"brand new, all clean, chosen according to reviews. View on the sea? meh. But a hell of a racket non-stop for 12 hours now. It will be one o'clock in the morning. Music, background noise, boom boom, old rock special bikers, local group badly covering hits from the 80s, all at full amps coming from the chiringitos below on the beach. Not the foot at the beginning of September."
110435,2212178,3,infiernos,10/08/2022,"Large area on the beach, price with electricity € 20 day, very new 1 km from the town. The price a bit high"
110435,2165190,5,gabla,03/08/2022,"Of the three pitches, I would definitely recommend this one. Slightly elevated position so that you have sea views and are a little further from the road. A quiet and friendly pitch. Very clean and well equipped with nice operators. If they are not on site when you arrive, simply call so that you are given free spaces and the barrier opens"
110435,2109094,4,carabellabeach,22/07/2022,"Good location with very clean toilets and showers, laundries and sinks. We got a shadow and we were great. How bad it is to have to call a phone to be able to enter and leave the area and the Pebble Beach that we have even come with injuries. Price €20 with electricity"
110435,2104320,5,brasilandes,21/07/2022,Great location right in front of the beach. The owners are very friendly. We stayed one night as we were traveling through. Spacious pitches with gravel underground. All facilities are available. Overall a fantastic place and we will definitely come back to stay longer.
110435,2094029,5,Evaump81,19/07/2022,it's great. in front of the beach. clean and super nice sir. We arrived outside of check-in hours and without a reservation. and no problem for one night alone. to put a snag ... it lacks a self-service washing machine and it would already be the milk

110435,2030757,5,donatelo53,02/07/2022,"Very good place, lovely owners, very clean bathrooms with an outdoor shower for when you come from the beach. It would lack some shade and that the music from the beach bar would not be heard until late at night."

110435,2005073,2,chavo,24/06/2022,the area is very good but the beach is bad and the beach bar in front with loud music until 2 in the morning.
110435,2000234,5,boneil2,22/06/2022,"Lovely spot just across from the beach. Friendly and helpful staff working hard to make improvements to the site. Great bar next door, Canaries chicken and chips is stunning for €6.50 but avoid getting sucked into buying drinks until you know the price, like a €2 jug of sangria for €13 ... Highly recommend this site and it will only get better"
110435,1994479,4,jillyandbazza,20/06/2022,A great spot overlooking the sea.  Lovely owners and good facilities only 1 female/male/disabled toulet & shower.  Amazing seafood restaurants and bars (one a tad noisy during night). Short of shade.  Still a lovely spot. ✅✅✅
110435,1989838,4,ubrendel1,18/06/2022,"The place is good, the boss is super nice, the toilet and shower are super clean. As on the campsite, children romp until night and Spaniards in groups really loud, you have to like it"
110435,1875470,3,MJR,07/05/2022,"Prices have gone up. It already costs 13 euros (per night), the car with two people. I understand that everything is more expensive, but before, when you went on the weekend, you could go out on Sunday after lunch at no extra cost. Now they charge 5 euros for this. Also, depending on where you camp, you have to pay one price or another."
110435,1827094,5,esepepe,16/04/2022,"Good services, with showers, sinks and drying area. Everything very clean even though the area was full. The woman at the reception is very helpful and friendly.

110435,1813272,3,AgnesMenuet,10/04/2022,"Very friendly reception staff and good views of the sea, but if you go during the weekend, you can hear very loud music from the beach bar downstairs in a disco style until 01:30 in the morning (it was supposed to close at 12:00 but it seems that they do not respect the schedules. The owner called the police). A pity because very difficult to sleep before 02:00 in the morning."

110435,1651202,5,choccy5254,18/10/2021,"A perfect camper park for enjoying the beach. It sits above the coastal road and whilst the road noise is evident, it is not intrusive. There are bars below which do produce some noise but on the 2 nights we were there we were treated to some good quality live music. Plots are of a good size (50m2) on gravel but many need levellers. Front plots have a good view out to sea."
110435,1643948,5,jessen333,14/10/2021,"Due to the terrace location, a great view of the sea and a safe feeling in the evening. Very clean everything a parking space needs. The way to the sea 50 m but coarse pebble beach. Lots of restaurants on the beach and nearby."

We recommend it !!"

Large washing machine of 9 kilos for 4 euros.Lekker bread to order that you can pick up in the morning.Everything looks neat.Below at the reception a cozy seat and a wall with all kinds of stones from campers.It is a must
110435,1227713,5,JLSJ,31/05/2021,"Perfect area, we have spent two spectacular days in the area, everything clean and correct, fair price, the beach bar opposite does not bother so much ...."
110435,1213576,3,EsthervdAa,23/05/2021,"The camper place itself is great, sanitary facilities are super clean and everything is there. However, it is noisy at the weekend, not only because of the music from the beach bar, but also at the camper place itself. You can of course just have a drink at the beach bar to avoid being bothered by the music;). If you like to visit Torrox, the location is great."
110435,1209893,1,Jesuslopez,21/05/2021,"The area itself is fine, good views and all the services, but the beach bar across the street is deadly, it's 00:00, it's empty and it continues with the trash music that it plays at full volume, it's an exaggerated thing. Here do not seek rest because it is impossible to sleep."
110435,1202711,4,palambre,16/05/2021,"In front of it there is a beach bar with horrible music, rumba type that tries to get going, but that bothers more than anything else, it's almost 9 pm and they've been giving it up all afternoon, I suppose it will stop at some time. on the beach it was annoying but up here you seem to hear more. the fantastic area the person who attends, the views, everything is great, but the music ....."

110435,1188777,3,yolo6667,08/05/2021,"I can confirm all the positive reviews, but only for the 6 weeks of our presence in the winter months. But: In May we have to experience at the weekend that large families, even with caravans, take the pitch for themselves without considering other campers. The night's rest is not observed, the children throw stones, dogs are not leashed, the adults run several times over foreign parcels without a face mask near the dining table. Unfortunately, kind words and requests are of no use. From 4 p.m. until after midnight, music can be heard from the beach bar. Anyone looking for peace and quiet is definitely wrong here (on the weekend)!"
110435,1184215,5,ZB2JK,03/05/2021,Nice site with a great view over the sea..

Showers are paid, but they are really well-thought through and have everything you need. We spent two nights, but would have loved to stay longer."

110435,1150022,4,Frankia84400,11/03/2021,"Beautiful parking area accessible to all sizes. for trailers and cars, parking at the entrance. the prices are decreasing. in March we paid € 11.50 without electricity. for electricity, it is € 3 per connection once, then 0.40 cents per kw / h. it is better to ensure the day before of available space and to reserve. Our German Friends are in the majority. Welcome in French."
110435,1137241,5,Mutbegleiter,14/02/2021,"Close to the sea and restaurants. There was always a free shower (hot water comes immediately), unfortunately only cold water for rinsing. Many permanent campers in winter. The rear seats (31-36) cost € 8.50 per night for stays of 14 days or more, but drive-up wedges are required. Helpful operators - good recommendations."
110435,1131607,5,Balloni,18/01/2021,"Nice parking space right on the coastal road. 50m above the coastal road, so hardly any traffic noise, at least hardly audible to us.

110435,1128082,3,bzwirbel,04/01/2021,"5 stars for the employees, 4 stars for the location, plumbing, we used our own for various reasons. 2 stars for the size of the place (only because some permanent campers behave like the Platzcheriff's and this to defend their territory, because they put their motorhome on the place marking and complain unfriendly when they no longer open their garage door) So much for the distances which should be adhered to due to Corona. If we had parked the other way around, our friendly neighbors would always be in our place in front of their garage without a 1.5 meter gap. Perhaps they would have asked us to put our chairs and the table away so that a distance can be maintained, so we would not have been able to leave our mobile home at all. A good tone and a friendly hello at the beginning would certainly not have been a mistake. As the saying goes: c'est le ton qui fait le musique. Unfortunately, for the reasons mentioned, we cannot award a star to the operator, who is really very nice, but tolerates something like that. We experienced something like this for the first time during our entire trip during Corona. Too bad. It's a shame that there are such permanent campers. Brings the whole camper who are friendly and helpful in a wrong light."
110435,1108653,5,almiro,29/10/2020,Very kind and friendly owners. We arrived at night and they weren't at the reception but they let us spend the night and pay them the next day. Quiet place. By the sea. Very good views. Very clean. Excellent.

By the evening a fantastic moody sky was showing, with all the lights below in the cities, as far as the eye could see.

10 euros a night parking ,so reasonable..would recommend this parking as a transit area for water changes,as the town is basic."

The entire area is restricted, you have to sleep somewhere before entering the national park because otherwise you will be fined. And they patrol at all hours"
110573,2520453,5,Martin5698,12/12/2022,"Nice parking lot, 2 km away from the gondola. Were with several campers in the parking lot, very clean and quiet. Gladly again."

110576,445171,3,Pw847,26/03/2019,Be careful in the morning a lot of car blocking the passage to go out. To leave before 9h or from 12h30. To arrive from 19h a lot of place. When people leave to eat. I had a quiet night. Not very flat. A toilet a little lower.
110577,2236526,4,Janve,14/08/2022,"Central parking, valid to visit the town or to take a bath in its river beach (don't even think about entering with the AC) there are currently some public bathrooms to use."

A disused building just opposite with vs and come from young people who are not bad. The monastery is 1 hour walk from this spot, perfect for a short walk before the visit"
110578,1763973,1,logan7885,23/02/2022,just park for going at the monastère by foot. it's really not safe close to this road.

110615,1130766,2,petyametya,15/01/2021,"Town centre was almost impossible to navigate with a Citroen Jumper. Way too central to spend the night. Instead, we drive a little further down to the Marina where there was a bigger parking lot. Two more vans were present during the night. Some industrial noise in the early morning, but the view is a consolation. 
Please note: we stopped at Marina de Alhandra instead!"

110618,3240425,5,huebnet,31/08/2023,"One of the best places on our tour. There were a few campers under the pine trees by the sea or, more sunny, further back by the river. Beautiful, wide sandy beach, fresh sea, good shower with a fixed jet, also with seating for disabled people."
110618,3228180,5,prsoler90,27/08/2023,"Quiet open space, next to beach bars, showers, promenade and beach. You could tell that there were people who had been there for several days."

No place in the shade (at this season nothing surprising), but at the edge of the water, you can come across turtles Then the beach, nothing to say, free deckchair under the parasols, calm and very pleasant spot Shower on the beach... what more could you ask for during a road trip? Try to pick up your trash"
110618,3157290,4,daciaviaje4,16/08/2023,"It is a good place, it can be seen that there are people who live here all year round, the people here are very friendly and in the afternoon it began to fill up with campers, we spent one night and without a problem, the only bad thing is that the ground is all sand / mud and that sometimes it smells very bad"

110618,2841540,4,ManiTheVani,11/06/2023,Ok spot for a night but not the nicest beach and the carpark is quite dirty with a number of pot holes. Plenty of campers there who were all really friendly.

110618,2692135,3,maumau83,23/04/2023,it's good for one night we're practically on the beach but with the materials processing center next door we have sewage smells it's unpleasant

there are a few full timers and dogs off there leads but we had no problems.
at the end next to the beach they are building a bar so a bit of noise and the carpark was muddy.
Good phone signal and shower on beach working"
110618,2586512,1,teatros,22/02/2023,"I gave up parking here. Half of the vehicles are clearly permanent residents leading a sedentary lifestyle here. The area is sand. After rainfall there is water. I continued 200 meters to a patch of grass by the road. I do not recommend for Concords, etc. :) or with trailers. A hippie from the 1st camp offers tattoos"
110618,2555443,3,rvanvugt,19/01/2023,"Yep, the sewage treatment plant does cause noise with its pumps and may smell depending on the wind. And with rain, the area becomes terribly muddy. Nevertheless a good option with direct view and acces to the beach, where you can also find a functioning shower (Jan 2023). Due to the high trees a lot of shade, quiet during the night but some traffic during the day."
110618,2546424,4,DanielaKorinek,08/01/2023,"We like it. 5 campers are here. calm and beautiful. Yes, the treatment plant smells a bit every now and then, but it feels safe."

110618,2449408,3,Frantellez,17/10/2022,"the site actually has a good location, there are almost always more vans or motorhomes, the pedestrian walkway that passes right in front leads to Estepona, it is an incredible walk always by the sea. As a negative point, right next to the parking there is a building that is a sewage pumping station, at night it produces some annoying noises and the smell it gives off is nauseating"
110618,2434084,4,marmy,09/10/2022,"Nice place, shower available (even water under the bench), quiet at night, quieter during the day - at least nothing will be lost, they come by car to walk the dogs, one night is fine, GSM signal is ok."

I could also 3 hours to the beach, all good. Beach showers currently not in use! Garbage disposal is possible. Good place for dogs. Fish and turtles and small snakes can be found in the river. It's a great place"
110618,1788295,4,NinaLuz,19/03/2022,"At first glance a great place, it has rained a lot so very blubberig. Feels a bit remote and is now quiet, I arrive around 7 pm. Before you approach the parking, there is a lawn where 4 campers are and there is still a lot of space There is a service road where you can stand and on the river also wel. So much space. Because I travel alone, I especially 'feel' where it feels like safe sleeping. was fine!"

Now it is good because it is January, in high season you cannot come. There are no services and just in front between the parking lot and the beach there is a very beautiful walkway to walk. I recommend it in low season."

You have to go down a very narrow street and in a forbidden direction to access the parking lot not suitable for large motorhomes, and the road is winding at a maximum of 30 kilometers per hour for 7 or 8 km. Perhaps with a small camper you can get there well with a medium or large motorhome, better abstain."

However, there are not many places, so you have to come early in the morning or late in the evening. I spent 2 nights there. Better suited for smaller vans than large motorhomes. Some cars park there at night, turn on the music, but it was ok."
110682,2478600,3,RocioManzano,02/11/2022,"It is a small open space, where they take 3-4 normal motorhomes. You have to be lucky to get a seat, but you can't ask for more when next door you have the Alhambra car park for between €30-60 depending on the season. It has no clear service. A fairly quiet place to sleep although somewhat uneven."

Our ac and other vans were parked, not many, but if you want to be next to the Alhambra for free and close to the center, it's great! One morning a super nice security guard appeared, who explained to us that the Granada government team does not want campers but that it was legal here and there were no robberies. If we return, it will be here"

If you like running, you can also easily explore the city on foot. A really great view by day and night! It's right on the street, it's not absolutely quiet. If it bothers you, don't stay the night. We would come again!"

Thank you."
110682,1718886,4,Crmpuce,29/12/2021,"Free place to spend the night very close to the Alhambra (you can walk 5-10 minutes). It is almost next to the other parking lot that costs 30 euros. Hollow for about 5 vehicles, it depends on how you park. It is not too flat but for one night it is fine. There will be about 30 minutes walking to the center, along the Paseo de los Tristes. On the return with the C35 bus you are already in the area in 15 minutes."

110682,1693045,5,irandagetti,19/11/2021,Small free parking but with a beautiful view over Granada. Perfect for a night or two to visit the city and the Alhambra. Close to the road so a bit noisy but with ear plugs it's perfect.

110682,1661558,3,mayo19,25/10/2021,"Room for two or three campers, the rest we park in line. Without services and quite exposed, but ideal if you want to visit the Alhambra or want to visit the center, since there is a bus stop in front."
110682,1582233,5,Leyeti05,16/09/2021,An extraordinary view of the city. Only 2 places. 500m from L'ALHAMBRA.
110682,1567390,5,martaoscar,11/09/2021,"Incredible views of Granada from this car park. Very quiet place, you can find mini bottles, but they are higher up and do not bother. 25 min walk from the center (downhill) we took a taxi for € 6. There were more campers there. 100% recommended."
110682,1546179,4,Arrecifes,04/09/2021,"It is a fairly small road (dead end), we arrived at 10pm and there was no room, but around 11pm all the cars left, so we were able to park the van. Incredible views and very quiet area. We had a visit from a few cats and some security guards who respectfully asked us not to take out tables and chairs, but to have the van there and sleep."
110682,1528222,5,hoppiness,29/08/2021,"We stayed here for three consecutive days; we left the van and went down to town (it takes 15 minutes on foot). The place is very quiet, there is a beautiful view of the city from above. She passed the surveillance twice to ask us if everything was ok, they were very kind, it really seems like a safe place."
110682,1484727,4,ZaoosAnatia,20/08/2021,"We have left the van to visit the Alhambra, it is about 10 minutes walk. We are going to spend the night here, at the end of the street it is a little flatter in the rest with incline. There is no water or toilets and the bar next to it seems closed. There were kittens and one almost jumped inside us."
110682,1305115,5,txan11,08/07/2021,"Good place to sleep and with beautiful views. AC was there all day, it’s great to go to the Alhambra. Quiet area for overnight and good views! We left the AC all day to visit the Alhambra."
110682,1273128,4,RaquelVR,23/06/2021,"Very quiet area to spend the night and visit the Alhambra, it is very close and you can walk. We slept one night and it was quiet, we also left the Camper parked during the day and went to visit the Alhambra. drawbacks: the bar is closed, there are no services nearby, not even to empty waters."
110682,1177176,5,Lepinperdus,21/04/2021,Small car park ideal for visiting the Alhambra and avoiding paying the exorbitant prices of private car parks!
110682,1158149,4,GianlucaHammers,26/03/2021,Arrived in the late morning to visit the Alhambra (15 minutes from here). Convenient and relatively quiet considering it is on the street side. I trust in the lockdown at 22.00 set up for the Andalusian province.
110682,1124229,3,Anaaa,27/12/2020,It is very close to the Alhambra parking lot for motorhomes and is a quiet place to spend the night. But only 2 vans and a car enter if there are no cars. I recommend going in reverse for exit time in case you get a little trapped as there is no room to turn. For the day after reading the comments we went to the Alhambra car park as we did not feel confident leaving her alone there.
110682,1090068,4,Kelokei,11/10/2020,"Good view, we arrived and there were many cars but we parked without problem. Quiet night, in the morning walkers and cyclists pass. 5 min walk from the alhambra pay parking."
110682,1083198,3,Tamarindo86,05/10/2020,We slept two nights and had no problems but we did not dare to leave the van during the day. There were crystals on the floor. The views are beautiful.
110682,1042035,5,cabuti99,11/09/2020,"Spectacular views if there is no one and you catch the last site one pass, the photo of the white camper is mine on this site, there are no services. We have spent a brutal night here."
110682,760005,3,grandadsgapyear,30/12/2019,Ideally placed for Alhambra but make sure you have booked tickets or arrive at the ticket office very early as they sellout. Also best to arrive at the parking in the evening as there isn’t much space.
110682,757448,4,lurmiba,27/12/2019,"We spend one night, small place but very well located, near the Alhambra and 20 min walk to the center. If you want there is a bus stop on the other side of the road. The number 35 that leaves you in Isabel la Catolica square (in the center of the city)."
110682,534148,1,Jevina,30/06/2019,"Maybe we were just unlucky but we were gone for 2 hours during the day to visit the alhambra, and we came back to find our driver window broken, and they had taken both our rucksacks. Maybe this is how the locals express their frustration at people parking here? Either way, we'd never recommend this to anyone."
110682,527613,5,calibeach,24/06/2019,We use it to park for free and spend the day in the Alhambra from 11am to 6pm. It takes a long time to get to the paid parking of the Alhambra 3min walking. the parking of the abusive alhambra 4'80 € / h and 52 € / 24h
110682,511562,4,oudeska,11/06/2019,"The spot is good. Arrived on Tuesday, 7:45, high season. Tickets already sold out for next 4 days. The locals aren't happy with all the parking cars but apparently there's nothing they can do about it."
110682,445609,4,JCFish,27/03/2019,"We used the car park to visit the Alhambra, it is really close to the entrance. Running lazy can also take a stop by bus, which stops directly at the car park. I would not stay here as it is right on the street."
110682,437918,5,carsina,08/03/2019,Quiet place to spend the night is somewhat inclined very close to downtown 25 minutes and 13 from the Alhambra. There is little room we are 2 ac and two Camper because there are parked cars. near the road but not very noisy.
110698,1840119,3,apyguay,20/04/2022,"Apparently quiet place but it is attached to the road and many cars pass by (at least during the night we stayed). The train passes by behind every so often and that annoys when it has not yet dawned. At night there was a group of teenagers very close by making noise (I guess a bottle) which made it difficult for us to sleep. Because there is light from street lamps, the birds sing even at 5 in the morning"
110732,1114415,3,marisa_nb,11/11/2020,"We have just arrived and the place is beautiful, but the navigation has taken us down a path of owners completely impossible for caravans. My van is small and has suffered with uneven ground"
110732,615243,2,Corriente,10/08/2019,"After more than 16 years traveling and overnight in that place and surroundings. on August 8, some heartless people who did not say a barbarity, violated the door of our motorhome leaving it unusable to take only a camera of a girl who was hiding under the seats. Since recently this place is no longer safe because we are not the first to be robbed here."
110732,533959,4,Corriente,30/06/2019,Good place to spend the night and if the sun does not bother you also the day. Although there is a lot of sun in summer from 10.30 to 19.00 approximately. nearby there is a picnic area with wooden tables and even a children's playground including a source of drinking water. Perfect place for the route of the throat of the Nogaleda and natural beach of the Jerte river.
110732,528055,4,albarnipe,25/06/2019,Quiet and small place where a walking route begins to the Las Nogaledas gorge. If the noise of the river does not bother you to sleep it is an ideal place. There are many trees so getting shelter from the sun early in the morning is perfect.
110732,440225,5,Andresmaria,15/03/2019,"If you park in battery, fit three or four campers. During the day, cars are parked to make the ""throat of the nogaleras"" route."
110746,3252220,4,Robin890,03/09/2023,Very beautiful view. The driveway is not suitable for every vehicle as the edge is quite high. But no problem with my Sprinter. I spent a good night here.
110746,3238844,4,AniSpahieva,30/08/2023,"The view compensates the bad entrance (very big holes) and everything else. No shade, so if it's hot outside, it will be hotter inside :D. There is no good service either. Beach nearby."
110746,3110574,4,Aishanna,09/08/2023,"A spectacular view. A 40-minute walk from the center. In the company of other campers, quiet and peaceful. We found the place clean. Beware of potholes when entering the dirt parking lot."
110746,3094422,4,UKVWRafter,07/08/2023,"Careful upon entry there’s two places to enter this spot choose wisely, lovey spot"
110746,3090412,2,balou7373,06/08/2023,"Very nice view but lots of traffic, asser noisy."
110746,3077671,3,ameliesperling,04/08/2023,"Very nice view but the place itself is difficult to drive through the high curb and the bumps, stones on the square. Not suitable for every car/mobile home. We couldn't / didn't want to risk driving on it through the underground"
110746,3028778,3,Adelieetstef,27/07/2023,"Arrived at midnight on the spot, there were young people installed everywhere around, music. We did not feel comfortable and preferred to sleep a little lower. But the spot is top, beautiful view!"
110746,2586207,3,YlBlu,21/02/2023,"the place is very quiet, parking on a cliff, the only problem is access, only with Jeeps or vans not suitable for too low vehicles. we didn't stay for the night"
110746,2544427,3,AlbertRC,06/01/2023,"Parking very close to Alicante (not to go on foot). It is close to the road but you can sleep very quietly. We spent the night on 01/01 and it was super good. Too bad the lack of hygiene with a lot of garbage. Cliff very close without any protection. If it were level, with wooden perimeter protection and without brush or debris, it would be phenomenal."
110746,2516578,4,ArthurGarderes,08/12/2022,"Very practical place, there were not so many people in this season. You can park quietly and nobody bothers. Very close to the downtown. There is traffic and people who come for the view but nothing annoying."
110746,2509700,1,adamwilson,30/11/2022,"this place is not surrounded by nature!!! far from it, close to a main road and almost in the city center of Alicante. not for us. 
So, indeed a star for it's city location (if that's what you like) and  views of the ocean. be careful when entering."
110746,2508039,3,BulliHomeZone,28/11/2022,Space would be great though! be careful who wants to drive on it in the dark…. Must reckon with a lot of rums. The edge is so deep that I didn't dare even with the campervan.... A few meters further is a parking lot on the left…. Better to choose and take nice photos opposite…. View wow though
110746,2487376,5,ArturFriday,08/11/2022,"good acess for small vans , got hr vivaro, 2 places on main road if you scarr on slope."
110746,2476271,5,toby92,01/11/2022,"Slept well, in the morning only a few people left their car there to go for a walk but it was November 1st so there is! To sleep near Alicante is a good solution!"
110746,2440070,5,J994H,12/10/2022,The driveway is not as bad as described in the comments. Great place for the night.
110746,2396609,5,boonievanlife,23/09/2022,"drive in from the right side of the blue sign, it looks bad but didnt scratch the bottom just go slow. Both road entries are too deep, lots of scratch marks on the road there. 

Great panoramic view."
110746,2371048,4,Suna79,14/09/2022,"As seen in the third photo, the ideal is to enter and exit where the green arrow indicates, that's perfect. Very rocky and steep terrain, but leveling the wheels for the rest, quiet and clean. sound of the sea in the background"
110746,2356373,5,tamtamangie,09/09/2022,"Arrive early to get a good seat because not big! Regarding the big step you have to pass on the side in the ground (next to the blue sign with arrows), magnificent spot with the moon which lights up the sea and a sunrise worthy of the name. Rather quiet despite the road not being so far away."
110746,2030567,5,mattmoore97,02/07/2022,"Great spot, the step down really isn’t that bad. Looks quite steep but it isn’t. We’ll worth it if you want to visit Alicante"
110746,1940021,1,camperGilbert,02/06/2022,"To steep to go down there, wouldn’t recommend. There’s a parking a little bit further on the left. It’s more safe to drive and park there."
110746,1807256,4,infernomand,05/04/2022,"I didn't dare to drive over the edge with my camper and then parked about 30 meters further along the road on the left in a small parking lot. Wasn't a problem either and the view was still very nice, but unfortunately there was a lot of rubbish lying around."
110746,1746760,4,diiiddz,03/02/2022,"Great spot! A bit noisy from the road, but the view is amazing!!"
110746,1744829,2,mrlmcv,31/01/2022,"For sure the spot is very scenic, but to get in you will risk damaging your vehicle given the high step down from the road and massive rocks around. We could sleep until 1 am, but we have to move away after a strong wing came up and some cars with kids playing loud music arrived"
110746,1741363,2,chitemmurte,25/01/2022,"We tried without success several times to get in, but after hearing a screeching sound from the exhaust pipe we decided to move down the road to a easier spot. It's a pity because the view is lovely."
110746,1732404,5,BenniBen82,12/01/2022,Great pitch with a beautiful view of Alicante. You can get to town in 15 minutes by bike. Trash cans are also on site!
110746,1708013,4,O.A,11/12/2021,"Stayed two nights here, first night was disturbed at 5am by a car playing loud music, but otherwise not bad, nice views and close to Alicante center."
110746,1701749,1,StephiEichbaeck,02/12/2021,"With a normal motorhome, we don't see any possibility of getting onto the pitch without damaging the floor of the motorhome. We tried slowly, but it would not have been without damage, the sales are just too big. It's a shame, the location would be great."
110746,1656860,5,Dr.Kathi,22/10/2021,"Brilliant parking spot! as previously mentioned the curb to get there is indeed high but it is manageable. you get to park right on the cliff, during the night you sleep to the sounds of the waves (and some youngsters meeting there chatting, laughing and drinking) and in the morning you enjoy your first coffee directly towards the sunset

some waste bins available."
110746,1639120,4,pmorenctl,11/10/2021,"Place to spend a quiet night and close to the city. To put one downside, I would say that the road can be annoying if you have trouble falling asleep."
110746,1588618,4,Pyras,18/09/2021,"Near the main road, open space large enough to accommodate more cars. at night it is frequented by a few people but it is still a great place to sleep."
110746,1557151,4,Kellouch,07/09/2021,"Very unstable road, of course, but with patience, you can park without worries. Rather uneven ground, wedges would be ideal. A few young people with music when we arrived, but not very loud so not disturbing. Spot near a main road, but very quiet at night."
110746,1500389,4,ocece45,23/08/2021,"Place with a very nice view. The only downside is that there are people and music all night long. Personally, it didn't bother us too much because we were very tired. I recommend."
110746,1187039,1,Piloudou,06/05/2021,Go down a little more to the left 200m approximately
110746,1171819,5,cucumberblueprint,11/04/2021,"Accessible without problems! Yes, there is a very high ledge on the driveway that you see first when you approach the square. If you just drive straight over there, every mobile home that does not have off-road ground clearance will somehow get stuck. There is an easy way to get there, though. Someone else has already posted a drone picture here in which a possible entrance was marked. We found an even simpler one! If you drive around the curve and turn down on the coast, you can then drive from below in the direction of the parking space and just drive straight ahead in the curve between the traffic sign and the bush on the hill which is about 2m higher than the rest of the space. You can then either just stand on this mini hill, or simply drive down to the left to the normal place. Sounds a lot more difficult and adventurous than it is. Our heavy 7.3 m alcove motorhome with a very large overhang at the rear made it without any problems and without scratches. You have a great view of the sea and you are still close enough to Alicante to order food, for example :)"
110746,1160998,1,Konidreams,30/03/2021,Access impossible without damaging the underside of the van or campsite because the passage (the step) to access it is too high!
110746,1127962,1,BarryGrey,04/01/2021,I dont recommend this place. The threshold to get up this place is too high. Great chance of damaging your  exhaust or differential. The place is covered with sharp stones and rocks.
110746,1124381,5,Dratewki,27/12/2020,"Beautiful views, in the evening young people in cars, but silence at night. 30 minutes walk to the center of Alicante."
110746,1118564,5,MarcusEnFourgon,30/11/2020,"Magnificent view of the sea, free and without height limitation. Mind the step ! There is a fairly high border to go down (and up) to access the parking lot. DO NOT GO STRAIGHT ON THIS STEP. It is absolutely necessary to go on the bias otherwise you will rub underneath for sure! Van 6m, 3.3T, not raised, I got in and out of the parking lot 3 times without problem on condition of going at an angle, and smoothly, slowing down the descent. It's fair but it's okay. Check out the last photo! Follow the green line and turn around further if you do not arrive on the right side! Otherwise it's safe and certain to go rub underneath. Other than that, the spot is perfectly calm out of season, but not level."
110746,1116934,4,BenCampervan,22/11/2020,We spend a quit night here. A few cars in the evening but nothing to worry about. I added a picture of the little ramp you'll have to take to get on the parking spot.
110746,740507,4,captaindave47,09/11/2019,"A good spot with great views, as others have said the step down onto the parking area is a bit of a worry but I made it ok. The height barrier is no longer here."
110746,726173,4,Roberts92,20/10/2019,"Good view, 20 min walk into town, slightly unlevel, no services"
110746,721107,1,fizzghigg,14/10/2019,"I did not dare to enter given the height of the ""walk"" between the road and the car park. In full bend and close to the road. On the other hand, a small car park much more friendly is a few tens of meters away ..."
110746,698406,2,toniomero,20/09/2019,It seems a good place but the access step to the land area from the paved road seemed very large and I have not dared to enter ... the good place .. but the horrible access
110746,698103,4,Moerphi,20/09/2019,Very nice view. No problem to stay the night. No facilities around. We went to a nearby camping site for showers and restrooms.
110746,673759,4,moliolio,02/09/2019,"Normal beach parking, but quite good for one night. only in summer and on weekends is very busy and you will not find a parking lot on the beach"
110746,458095,4,ywane,18/04/2019,Of assured place and a beautiful walk by the sea. Not top for the night I think.
110746,444075,3,samani,24/03/2019,This is a parking spot overlooking the sea not a wild spot... that being said it's good for 3 vans and easy access in to town on foot! it next to the road but the sea overrides it
110759,2704803,1,aanaa_1992,29/04/2023,"Nothing works correctly. Washing machines that don't wash, dryers that don't dry. The water comes out very slowly and does not give time to fill. Very high gasoline prices."
110759,2603898,1,happy666campers,09/03/2023,A very expensive laundrette. 8kg wash is 5.45€ and the dryer is 3.99€ for 25 minutes. There is no table provided for you to fold your clothes. We will avoid this place in future.

110759,1950798,5,Grustolo,06/06/2022,LPG gas filling station. Very kind. They have the various unions that adapt to the various European external gas outlets to refuel directly from the pump.
110759,1885206,1,Nusschen,12/05/2022,"Unfortunately, we weren't allowed to fill our gas bottles... we asked nicely and got a resounding no. A sign on the GLP column also shows the ban on ""filling bottles""."

110759,1135254,5,CasitaNL,05/02/2021,Correct. LPG / GPL. Recommendable.
110759,774703,5,passum,31/01/2020,A normal gas station with the possibility of filling his gas bottle without any problems. Own adapter required. The gas price was very good and we would have no problems.

Payment machines all sealed off advising to pay with a parking telephone app.  Unaware if non compliance is enforced. Decide against and used Parking “Els Daus” further along the road.

110790,2734003,5,Kimskrams,08/05/2023,"There is no height limit and the car park is great for visiting the beach. Park a little further back and let the residents use the spaces closer to the beach, that's only fair."

110790,1573405,5,alx269,12/09/2021,"Perfect for a 7.5 long car but you occupy a square and a half, we spent the whole day and night there with more motorhomes and campers without problem"

Here there is no problem, it is wide. We parked in the 7.5m AC center and it occupies 1 and a half space with the rear one, but during the week there is no problem. At night, cars come to the beach bar but they do not bother and during the day, normal traffic. Everything is worse"
110790,1383329,4,surmania,30/07/2021,Nice place to sleep. Great for walking around the area
110790,1123165,1,agrupe,22/12/2020,A huge apartment complex is currently being built here. So this place is probably useless for all time. At the moment only for fans of Bob the Builder.

110800,2966117,4,ccigronlocation,15/07/2023,Good quiet spot in bush land within the hills on a short gravel road in fruit plantation (could be on a farmland but not sure - farmer did wave as he passed on tractor in the morning though).
110800,2588569,4,thainnp,23/02/2023,"Very nice, quiet area. We spent one night in the castle parking lot. There is a bench with table & dumpster. The way up is a bit bumpy, but doable with my VW bus. Unfortunately, there are a lot of oak processionary moths in the area (therefore 1 ⭐️ deduction), so be careful if you are out with a dog."
110800,2558363,5,JoelVadrouille,23/01/2023,"The path is bumpy but peace is at the end of the road. I even met a passenger car there... so it's ok, driving slowly."

110800,1679462,4,lega4,06/11/2021,"Very good for a vehicle if you cannot make it up. In November clementines are green, but probably around January it should be perfect."

110800,783077,5,syruswise,19/02/2020,"The road in is rough but we spent a quiet night, morning and early afternoon here, only saw two cars drive past. It's a short but fairly steep walk up to the castle but well worth the visit. Be mindful of your pets though as there were processionary caterpillars when we visited."

110818,3152918,3,Raulana,15/08/2023,A good place if you can park but there are always a lot of people and they also park badly and it can be difficult to get out of there. We didn't sleep because there was a lot of noise. I recommend eating in the inkwell as an experience is not bad (small dishes 8e and large dishes 16 very good product quality)
110818,2744333,3,michmaart23,12/05/2023,"Nice location near the beach and the restaurants but very noisy at night, the garbage trucks come at 00:30 and 02:30 and 03:00 to empty the bins in the parking lot, also a lot of noise from traffic."

110818,1850395,4,guardiola89,24/04/2022,"We spent the night well without any problem, there were no gorillas making a mess. Good communication to see the City of Malaga by having the 11 bus line 5 minutes away.

110818,1824554,4,MariaMall,15/04/2022,Good place to spend the night. Beach next door and playgrounds. The restaurant next door is fine. The only inconvenience is that the typical gorilla is there during the day .... I passed the police but they didn't say anything

110818,1689491,5,annaizqui,14/11/2021,"We have been great. We stayed for three nights, quiet. Without any problem. A little noise from road traffic but bearable. I guess the noise also depends on the time you go. The bus stop to go to the center (number 11) is 5 min. walking. The Tintero bar right there is fine. And the Panchi Corner is great! Very economical and perfect for breakfast."
110818,1081506,3,solrrak,04/10/2020,"The site is very well on the beach with showers, services and playgrounds. Many restaurants to eat, the bad thing is that there are gorillas in the parking lot during the day. The road is too close and the traffic is annoying."

110837,3093649,5,Eollia,07/08/2023,Nice to spend a night when you take the boat. 20 minutes from the port of Algeciras. Close to the road but you can't really hear it. Nature area with free animals. Let's continue to respect this place!
110837,3079218,5,EliasRiquelme,05/08/2023,we have spent the night without problem. there is no kind of service. neither water.
110837,3065453,3,landak,02/08/2023,Very nice quiet place. night. Perfect
110837,2954548,2,RalfSommer,12/07/2023,"The street noise is only bearable at night between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. Picnic tables available. Fire/BBQ prohibited by warning sign. No water, no toilets but plenty of toilet paper in the bushes. A garbage can available."
110837,2862194,5,LinduxR.,17/06/2023,Very nice pitch. Spent two quiet nights. hikers and cyclists during the day. no toilets. 100 meters away rubbish bin. very relaxed.
110837,2802512,5,MariaHeidi,30/05/2023,"three days in nature, slept great. there are spectacular trails, to be done on foot or by mountain bike, horses, cows, sheep and goats in freedom. there is an area with tables. At the entrance is a dumpster. entrance a bit narrow. There is a fountain in the area but it is currently closed."
110837,2698026,4,GeoffinSpain,26/04/2023,Would not recommend large motorhomes due to the entrance and cattle grid.
110837,2608008,5,TortugaenRuta,13/03/2023,"We spent an afternoon and night there, in case we coincided with STEPPE WOLF, just to say hello and chat, no luck, the place was very beautiful and quiet to sleep, every day we looked for more nature in this hostile world"
110837,2594036,5,Tenerifetene,28/02/2023,"easy access, there are tables and barbecue"
110837,2552114,4,KonDeer,15/01/2023,"Fine for one night. A bit tricky to find a flat spot. Very quiet and empty at night, but in the morning it quickly gets crowded."
110837,2539594,4,hejholahello,03/01/2023,"Fine and in nature surroundings. Not much noise from the road and with a view to the sea.  Not super leveled, but we found a fine spot anyway. Can recommend."
110837,2539284,5,Atanasiova,03/01/2023,Great place for a night! Nice views.
110837,2434916,5,Pavons36,10/10/2022,"Good stop in nature, trails are made from here because I see people who come park and start the route. Little or no noise from cars on the road. Great!!"
110837,2171767,5,TatieMarti,04/08/2022,Good for one night. Better here than in Algeciras city
110837,2083603,4,stepcek,17/07/2022,Nice stop next to the road. Sheep before our car in the morning. Camping tables near. Quiet night without any problem.
110837,1955422,4,luigi196,07/06/2022,"good place to spend the day. It is accessed without problem with a large volume. shade, and recreational area, routes can be made from there. the only bad thing, the traffic noise from the road next door. BE CAREFUL if you go with dogs, there are processionary caterpillars"
110837,1919454,2,zaturox,27/05/2022,I drove on in the middle of the night after sheep rubbed on my car here at night
110837,1795548,3,thevandrouille,26/03/2022,"Troubleshoot for one night. The road is close with a lot of passage. The earthling is not very flat, provide wedges or luck for a place on the flat"
110837,1734876,4,PetitTonnerre18,16/01/2022,"No level we had to put on the calles, quiet place in the middle of nature, we had the visit of 3 donkeys, access to hiking trails. Perfect for the night"
110837,1729528,1,VanLiz,08/01/2022,"I'm never quite sure that many of the people who write the reviews have lost the essence. 1. The square is less than 200 meters from the street, which means 2. you can hear the street noise and 3. you have to navigate a lot to stand there straight. In addition, the access is a challenge because instead of a small bridge only fixed iron bars bridge the hollow."
110837,1729169,4,feote,07/01/2022,It is a recreational area. There are tables and others to eat. Good place to sleep.
110837,1664112,3,laessigebaie,27/10/2021,Its okay for the night but not the besr place
110837,1602748,4,jogocu74,23/09/2021,"Good and very quiet place to spend the night and go on a hiking route in the morning, I spent one night here because in Tarifa town there was a lot of air and here just a slight breeze."
110837,1531892,5,zuliettah,30/08/2021,"Very nice place, quiet, only some locals passing. picnic are with water and BBQ
Be prepared for the visit from horses, donkeys and cows!"
110837,1388731,4,Stefanus,01/08/2021,"Great place to sleep, a bit crooked and now and then a car that drives by"
110837,1141014,3,TheresiaWittwer-Wolf,22/02/2021,Can rain and storm heavily here. Barking dogs can disrupt sleep. Great view. All around a lot of sheep and a lot of birdsong.
110837,1134793,4,Estraellia,03/02/2021,Nice place to spend the night. lot of people in the morning even in weekdays.
110837,1121753,4,kieranandalice,17/12/2020,Nice spot but not many level places. We got stuck in the mud as it rained overnight
110837,1056522,3,Basq,18/09/2020,Great location for autumn migration. At least 100 birds of prey over in a couple of hours this afternoon.  50 white storks seemed to abandon in the high winds and may have dropped down to wait for quieter weather.  Kestrel hunting here gave great views and saw off a rival with talons exposed at it.  The water tap was not working.  People came for the view across the Africa and left. Some locals passed through but fairly quiet
110837,1043131,4,Miranda05,12/09/2020,Nice spot to spend the night. Lots of people come and park during the day at the weekend to do the trail. Other than that it’s pretty quiet.
110837,927762,5,Edu_Mdelr,04/08/2020,"Full moon that could be seen from the skylight, silent and with a super beautiful and calm landscape. on a slope but maneuvering you can manage to sleep flat."
110837,570552,3,juliot4,23/07/2019,Good place to spend the night. Quiet and with vegetation .. there is no water or lighting. Not many people pass. It has bike and hiking strips. He even passed the civil guard and told us nothing at all .. recommended
110837,434625,3,robinreems,28/02/2019,"The road was very busy. But we were the only people at the place, we spent one night."
110837,433738,3,nenette1976,26/02/2019,"We had a good night. Cars are not disturbing. By cons, after 1 year on Portugal without any worries. This morning, despite a padlock, we could only note the theft of our son's bike. 700 euros! The road is quite practical, we went with a bus 13 tons empty. I wish a masterful fall to the thief!"
110837,429672,4,abycis,15/02/2019,Very nice place at the foot of the mountains and a nice walk. We are visually cut off from the road but we can hear cars passing by. Path leading to the parking lot very passable.
110837,424582,1,robertrouveen,25/01/2019,We did not reach this destination so no information about the location itself. Road is in very terrible condition. With car or maybe a van should work.
110839,3127101,4,joseman2013,12/08/2023,"It is the parking lot of a sports center. We arrived at night and it was empty. Quiet and without noise to spend the night. In the town there are several shops to buy fruit, bread..."
