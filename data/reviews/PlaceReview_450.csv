16457,732227,5,Sophieee,28/10/2019,Absolutely stunning place. We stayed for the weekend to surf and also walked around the lagoon. No services up here - LEAVE NO TRACE! Especially toilet tissue - take it home.
16457,401565,5,barou,30/10/2018,Grandiose ... Place everywhere around the lighthouse or other car parks. Paradise for surfers and breathtaking views ...;)
16457,144956,5,Roberrr,22/06/2017,"Super wapa area, very quiet with incredible views. Without services of any kind. We were an AC all night and we were very calm. During the day a lot of car traffic visiting the lighthouse. At night nobody. Take care of the site a lot because I want to go back. Greetings good trip."
16457,83888,4,bateau654321,21/07/2016,We had a wonderful night. To avoid surely by high wind.
16457,44661,4,tmartin,29/07/2015,"After a stormy day, it was a great show"
16459,3144431,5,Solen44190,14/08/2023,great quiet spot compared to the crowds on the coast. waking up with the horses near the van. I recommend but steep access and not very flat ground
16459,2789557,5,vanval47,27/05/2023,"Quiet place, at the start of a hiking trail. Only problem not very flat."
16459,2735893,4,citcit,09/05/2023,"Very nice view, quiet place but not very flat."
16459,2434836,4,ElAvocado,10/10/2022,"very pleasant, not much traffic (Sunday to Monday) steep side, my little t4 of 80hp passed, but in second ^^'"
16459,1768572,4,Davlor95,28/02/2022,Super quiet spot in the middle of nature. With a view of the ocean on one side and the Rhune on the other! We were alone that night. Indeed the last kilometer is steep and the road narrow.
16459,1455387,3,sweethome70,14/08/2021,"Nice for the day. However, it has a poster for the night (July 2021) which forbids the stationing of campers, if I understand everything correctly."
16459,997480,5,aquaselva,24/08/2020,"Be careful, the access is very very steep for a camper van, we squeezed our buttocks so as not to cross people But it's really worth it, crazy view especially at night, small grass freshly grazed by horses a hike behind which leads to a huge 360 view, in short the best but now that I know the place I will not go back with a camper for sure."
16459,990800,5,gintonicgurke,22/08/2020,We had a super quiet night! Best view. It is best to arrive in the light of day.
16459,978124,4,Ferdi2020,18/08/2020,"Great view over the bay, you are not alone, steep but manageable driveway."
16459,976782,5,Croods,18/08/2020,"Great spot, magnificent view. A short tour of the area before leaving to pick up some cigarette butts and other small rubbish here and there. keep leaving this place clean. thank you."
16459,930218,4,bgilles,05/08/2020,Very quiet spot with superb views of the valley and the ocean. Fairly easy to access even if the last km is quite steep. I found some space but the site is still quite busy. The ground is slightly inclined but this is not really a problem for the little guys. I recommend !
16459,834295,5,Sabannaje,23/06/2020,"Nice place, very, very frequented, this allowed us to have a nice meeting with travelers from 34"
16459,645186,5,polkaaa,20/08/2019,Super spot! Magnificent views of the mountains and the ocean with bonus horses in freedom.
16459,631316,5,teddyc44,15/08/2019,Stunning views of the sea.We are alone to admire the landscape.
16459,590727,4,YST,01/08/2019,Great view ; calm ; 4 locations small vehicles max because too steep for others!
16459,415170,4,RAP66,20/12/2018,"The sunrise of this trip par excellence. It was very windy and unfortunately we did not sleep well (California with pitch roof). At Mor * en, the parking lot is used by hikers as a starting point. At less wind at any time."
16459,397081,5,Anniv,22/10/2018,"1st experience of night in Van successful thanks to this spot, calm where we were alone and the view is really nice"
16459,332555,5,HueyTL,14/08/2018,"Great, even in the rain. the coast is very steep but we went up with a cell 6m, the ideal is to cross nobody over the last 500m. we were 3 with a van and a van. the most accessible places being occupied at our arrival we had to climb a few meters, choose the trajectories because it shakes and patina in the grass, but the view on the coast is superb, the quiet place in the countryside"
16459,310777,5,Mathis84,02/08/2018,Absolute world class!
16459,198285,5,dassmag,27/09/2017,"Superb quiet spot with a breathtaking view. the road is steep but worth it. A visit of the four-legged neighbors (horses) before sleeping, closed this beautiful day."
16459,191472,4,fabrik,08/09/2017,"Not really offroad, suitable for all kind of campervans not much longer than 6m"
16459,167551,5,portfolie,07/08/2017,"Great place, better to get there before dark to choose your place because the terrain is very rugged"
16459,163935,5,AudeL,02/08/2017,Very nice view of the sea and the mountains. Peaceful place. We are 3 motorhomes and our van but everyone has room for the night

16459,112722,4,jluc31300,31/10/2016,"Indeed great location with beautiful views of the city and the ocean, very quiet, dead-end road, only for vans, steep and narrow road."
16459,86720,5,olivetmag,29/07/2016,Superb view and absolute calm!
16459,53823,4,bedass,05/09/2015,Quiet location with breathtaking views of the Basque coast !! We had a great evening and morning. Thank you for keeping this place clean.
16459,22881,4,elodie.mercier@laposte.net,16/08/2014,"Very nice location overlooking the sea, quiet but reserved for vans or 4x4 cells because of the steep slope to access. Thank you for this discovery."
16489,3001442,5,Crisalbin,22/07/2023,"Very quiet, incredible views, very well located to visit the city, the access has a steep slope that can be climbed without problems (motorhome long 6.64m, wide 2.14). Incredible sunset."
16489,2958989,2,olgal60,13/07/2023,Only for visit to the sanctuary.
16489,2332298,3,jairo,02/09/2022,"Camper Ducato 6m without problem. The slope in first gear goes up well and is short. To spend the night it is uneven, it is better to go to the surrounding picnic areas, but to visit the town very well. 2/9/22 only two cars parked."
16489,2229487,4,unbalconnoche,13/08/2022,"Parking for the visit to the town, to spend the night I see it quite uneven. With regard to access to the town and to the parking lot, with our ac of 2.3 meters wide and 6.8 long there was no problem. We have all fought in worse places for sure."
16489,2194450,3,gas4g63,08/08/2022,"I don't understand how they can put comments that they have a hard time with a 2.32m wide motorhome. My integral Rapido measures 2.30 wide and without problems. There is a parking for buses, which go along the same road. A bus is much bigger than a motorhome, with that I say it all. Please refrain from commenting people who are not used to driving. Thank you!"
16489,1723432,2,trillonyotero,02/01/2022,"parking to visit the village, good toast."
16489,1571383,1,Vivemartinique5,12/09/2021,Parking inaccessible to motorhomes. shame
16489,1525031,3,haizetxu,28/08/2021,Good parking to visit the town.
16489,1501901,1,Ana177,23/08/2021,Magnificent point of view but bivouac prohibited (as everywhere in Spain).
16489,1357373,3,guismin,24/07/2021,"We went with an AC of 7.15m and I did not see it as difficult as they say to get to the town, if you find expensive cars you slow down and have a good time since the road is well skipped! the parking that puts, I did not even consider going up that piece of ramp! I parked in the parking lot at the entrance of the town if you find a clear place because the descent is not very big a bit steep! pretty pretty town"
16489,1344631,1,gleefulVan,20/07/2021,"The roads to Santo André are very narrow for the amount of traffic using them. We were there July 20th. The mist was so heavy it made the drive hazardous. The entrance to the parking is very steep and our 6.5m AC would have hit the dip. We parked in the bus parking closer to the village, which is also very steep. The village is over touristy with stalls selling cheap tat. We were not impressed."
16489,1248765,2,jcsgalvez,11/06/2021,"I reiterate what other comments say about the difficulty to get there due to the narrow but well paved road. Thanks to the few visitors we were able to park in the very steep bus area. It is not suitable for spending the night, much less the parking lot at the entrance. That said, the place is worth it for the views, the history and the meaning it has."
16489,1174080,2,Diegocdj,15/04/2021,"Getting to the site is ""easy"" the road has sidings in case cars come in the opposite direction, but getting to the parking lot is another matter, by car you go up well but in AC I think it would be a bit complicated. apart from the wind that was there today, 4/15/21 took your eyelashes away. lol, but the site is spectacular."
16489,1168789,3,crisydanicamperlife,06/04/2021,"It is a parking lot, it has 2 floors, we sleep on the top that is slightly sloping but you gain incredible views. It was windy but we slept well, there were 2 more vans."
16489,919650,3,rocinante,01/08/2020,"It is a parking lot to visit this town. NOTHING MORE. The two access roads are the normal ones in a mountain area, both from Cariño and from Cedeira, you can easily get there with an AC of 6.70 with practice and caution ... (I have found a trailer and a tractor with logs and we have passed), there are also sidings. It is not recommended to stay overnight by inclination and it is a parking lot."
16489,875166,1,madronika85,17/07/2020,"Parking without services, without shadows and inclined. not recommended for overnight"
16489,727124,4,malcon,21/10/2019,"Beautiful place with views of beautiful cliffs I arrived without problem with an AC of 7.20 long clear now in October there was no traffic, it is true that to sleep impossible by the inclination but to see the town without problem I could leave it in the bus parking , to eat or sleep there are before some beautiful and flat viewpoints."
16489,607342,1,KemaoB,07/08/2019,"EYE! Road to get very narrow, we have come with a 2.32-wide car (dethleffs advantage) and I have had a hard time. Very sloping parking lots, you burn half a clutch to maneuver, I don't recommend it at all with anything bigger than a camper. They could put a warning sign at the beginning of the road, but when you want to realize you are already in all the scrubbing ..."
16489,511678,3,Coquillette4X4,11/06/2019,Very beautiful view. Very calm. Very beautiful site. But parking very steep. Impossible to land except on a small location at the top of the second car park.
16489,357973,2,centrodelsur,29/08/2018,Inclined parking with access in slope. Only indicated to make visit to the town and to return to march
16489,330481,1,la.carraca.on.the.road,13/08/2018,We have not found the site. We have reached the bus parking and from there the road was cut. This parking is so inclined that it is impossible to sleep. We recommend moving to Cedeira.
16489,133001,4,mirabelle9,04/05/2017,Very nice village to visit. Very sloping. Can not sleep there cause slope. Superb and narrow road but it goes even in full.
16489,91222,4,willvy,08/08/2016,"The parking area is two levels high. They are very broad; although because of the inclination they have, it makes the use of leveling wedges useless. But the hermitage and its population are worth staying to see. The views of the mountains and the sea are spectacular. So I decided to park a few kilometers before arriving at the hermitage, in front of the O`CRUCEIRO viewpoint where there is an esplanade of land. My stay was quiet day and night. A great place to see. The access roads are badly indicated and you need a lot of caution."
16489,83886,4,bateau654321,21/07/2016,"This small village is wonderful. If you want to sleep flat, you have to go to the viewpoint areas towards Cedeira. The site is beautiful"
16490,3265866,5,EnyluPastor,06/09/2023,"We arrived at 5:30 p.m. today, September 6. and curiously, in the motorhome area, just behind one of the soccer goals, and parked in a line, there are about 10 spaces exclusively for motorhomes, and duly signposted. Many thanks to the City Council, because the place is idyllic, and with immaculate benches and picnic areas"
16490,3243955,5,RVs,31/08/2023,"Well located next to the river and pool and connected to the center by a short walk. It is next to the soccer field and a school so depending on the time there may be a game or training. Next to a road with little noise at night. It is small but you can park in the area. If we position ourselves well and don't mess up, they won't kick us out. The black emptying goes to the ground. There is water and no breakdowns"
16490,3238600,4,robingo,30/08/2023,"Comfortable area to empty and fill tanks, and to be able to visit Aguilar de Campoo. In summer it is full of motorhomes, so it is advisable to arrive early."
16490,3233304,2,Tanruz,29/08/2023,Good for draining and refilling water.
16490,3180858,4,amaiagg,19/08/2023,"Very comfortable and well located area, but right now the waters cannot be discharged. There is a fault that they will not fix until Monday."
16490,3137126,5,Marcopola,13/08/2023,"Very comfortable area to load and unload water, next to a park and close to the town center"
16490,3135390,5,Tejerojo,13/08/2023,Great point and incredible breakfasts in their cafeterias under portals. I recommend Ana Mari chocolate shop.
16490,3134032,5,eriel,13/08/2023,"The area is great, a step away from the town, well leveled and with all the services. But please, do not clean the potty in the water filling tap, read well that makes it clear. After seeing it I have not taken water of course"
16490,3129792,5,ClaraRoma,12/08/2023,"We have spent the night with a 7m nasturtium and great. It is important not to pay attention to the GPS because it makes you go under the bridge, you have to continue to the town and it will redirect you. Thanks to the town hall, I hope they win the Grand Prix"
16490,3107935,5,KlaraGuiomar,09/08/2023,"AC area equipped with water and drains. Perfect for visiting Aguilar de Campóo, its resources and its surroundings."
16490,3080050,5,Verdaguer86,05/08/2023,Very quiet night. Beautiful place 15 minutes from the center on foot. With all free services. Many thanks to the city council!!
16490,3076508,4,ELJURIS,04/08/2023,"Area with all services, very close to the population, charming, bustling and very tasty, for its meals. Worth a next visit."
16490,3012784,5,katabatic,24/07/2023,"Again in Aguilar. Load of cookies and good cheeses in the local trade. The area, of 10"
16490,3004747,5,avasgon,23/07/2023,"It's great!!!! Thanks to the city council for initiatives like this!!! We did not intend to stop in this town and thanks to the comments we decided to spend the night, have breakfast in the square, buy typical sweets and we were delighted with Aguilar!!!"
16490,3004148,5,Sin.deentrega,22/07/2023,We went back to Aguilar. Everything works perfectly. thanks to the town hall
16490,3003990,5,mafo111,22/07/2023,"A good area to visit the beautiful town of Aguilar de Campoo and its surroundings with all the operational services, thank you."
16490,2987881,5,PakitoCalvo,19/07/2023,"Paved area with all free services. There are picnic tables, it's near the town. The municipal swimming pool is on the other side of the river. There is a fountain and water drainage. Town with a lot of charm and things to visit. Thanks to the City Council and its workers."
16490,2985840,5,asor,19/07/2023,"Thanks to the town hall. Perfect area, paved and level. Very clean and everything works properly. Next to them nice tables when they are in the shade. 10 minutes from the center and the information office. Beware of the low bridge (hee hee)"
16490,2981936,5,rodrigo,18/07/2023,"two perfect days many restaurants to eat, spectacular landscapes. area with all services."
16490,2959599,5,GusHigueruela,13/07/2023,"We have spent a couple of nights and we have been very happy. It has everything you need to load and empty water. It is about 15 minutes walk to the center. It has a grassy area next to it with tables that are ideal for eating when it is shaded. Be careful, to avoid the tunnel that is right next to it, you have to go around the area a bit to reach the river area."
16490,2925579,4,alruro,05/07/2023,"Quiet area, near the town and with a drain service"
16490,2896771,4,clioj,27/06/2023,Great Air for visiting the town all services were working and clean very little road noise thank you to the local community
16490,2888566,3,AmberdeRidder,24/06/2023,"A nice place to stay for the night, but unfortunately no toilets that we could use. We had to go to the city center to use a toilet.
Luckily there was a music festival going on so we enjoyed that for a while."
16490,2875496,4,lemdan,20/06/2023,The municipal area is very well located and designed. Accuracy is required for the emptying of black water (toilet cassette). Do not empty under the cleaning tap but in the yellow hatch on the floor opposite the instruction panel.
16490,2864943,5,agilapalante,17/06/2023,"Great area by the river and a nice walk from a very pretty town. If you can choose, move away from the tunnel to avoid noise at night. Very friendly people and good trails."
16490,2843863,5,cocodoum,11/06/2023,"Thank you very much to the municipality for this free and well-equipped area! The village is beautiful, the walk along the river is relaxing. San Miguel Church is worth a visit. Do not hesitate to make a stop at the charcuteria fruiteria La Plaza (on the plaza de España) where you will be well received with good products (charcuterie, cheese, butter, yoghurts, fruit, and bread, etc.)."
16490,2786384,5,Velta90,25/05/2023,"very nice parking. quiet and calm. very nice city. short distance to the city centre. nice lawn with benches. emptying gray water, filling water and emptying the toilet. everything is okay. emptying the toilet is done by lifting a lid in the asphalt."
16490,2707512,4,Raul656,29/04/2023,"Perfect for visiting the town. Walk next to the river. Enough parking space. Attached to the school, but without inconvenience. Filled and emptied."
16490,2691155,4,janhyggelig,23/04/2023,Place okay but the disposal of the toilet! who constructs something like that (fine sieve through which you should probably pass everything? wow that's definitely a lot of fun)
16490,2688957,4,JosepPujol,22/04/2023,"It seems like an improvised area since on school days, there is a bit of chaos with the cars that come to drop off the children, but we were fine and went to the gullón cookie store. We also went by bike next to the river and to the big park next to it."
16490,2678919,3,park4nightducato1910,18/04/2023,"The area is the squares along the road where the tunnel is (limited height, you have to enter from the other side). The ones on the left side are very inclined. Picnic area on the right side. It was full and we parked in the parking lot in front of the nursery school, it doesn't say that you can't (it was closed at Easter). Plenty of room in general. Push-button faucet without thread."
16490,2661916,5,lubinkenneth,11/04/2023,Great services. Thanks for the community.
16490,2656185,3,LivingInLuna,10/04/2023,"Lovely stay… town worth a visit, services people don’t know how to use, the black waste is to be emptied via the floor and not the station, some have emptied black waste at the station and it’s all over the place! Shame as it doesn’t take a scientist to see what’s where…. Don’t park in the school car park, signs clearly show the parking area for campers"
16490,2655490,4,Pantocrator,09/04/2023,"We stayed one night and it was very good, the only thing is people who either don't know how to read or do it and throw the rest of the toilet where they catch it. Nice village."
16490,2644577,3,Bignugget,06/04/2023,"It's good, a quiet and spacious place."
16490,2627217,4,bkb,27/03/2023,"Very quiet and clean area. Very calm night. Picnic tables and green spaces. Functional service area. Sorting bins. To empty the WC cassette, there is a hatch in the floor to be lifted. Do not persist in emptying into the hatch under the tap, this drain is blocked. Nice town center. The church conceals treasures from the 12th and 13th centuries."
16490,2623589,5,Trevorwest,25/03/2023,"Fantastic aire quite at night. Great little town with a lot of history, allow yourself 2 days to look around the town great for bike rides. Only one hour from Santander port."
16490,2616190,5,Carlosb1,19/03/2023,"The place is fine, but someone regularly throws the poti shit into the clean water grate."
16490,2588099,5,Paul001,23/02/2023,"There is clear signage and a drain on the ground for solid toilet yet people think tipping poo onto the grate for everyone is acceptable. shocking behaviour. other than that the facilities are fine and the community has made an effort, just a shame people have to ruin it."
16490,2581564,5,JamesAshby,18/02/2023,"Great free park up with grass area and picnic benches next to it and all services. Nice walk into the lovely town. There was a carnival on and loads of motorhomes turned up quite late. There was a lot of noise - kids kicking footballs right by our van and adults shouting until about 3am, so didn't get the best night's sleep but I assume it was just because of the event and is usually quite quiet!"
16490,2568667,4,unpardedos,04/02/2023,"We have slept wonderfully, super quiet place and 5 min. from the center. You have to enter through the road that crosses the town, at the roundabout it is indicated with a sign. The photo does not correspond to the parking lot, it is coming to the tunnel (where you cannot go with the ac)"
16490,2546906,4,MonicaGarciaDiaz,08/01/2023,correct area. You can hear something from the national highway.
16490,2543264,4,covita,06/01/2023,We have slept one night since we are passing through and the truth is that we have slept wonderfully
16490,2515051,4,oscarsometro,07/12/2022,"The area is NOT the parking lot in the first photo, which belongs to a kindergarten and if the parking continues, the parents will complain about the lack of parking, so you should park closer to the tunnel with a gauge. comfortable area 10 minutes from town"
16490,2507161,4,khorne,27/11/2022,The main photographs show vans parking in the wrong place.   There is a small car park which appears to belong to a school and which many people are using in error.  The correct location is alongside the road in clearly marked bays.

16490,2446294,3,Treeza,16/10/2022,"It’s a nice aire, lots of motorhomes, a popular stop and a good one before heading to the ferry. Lovely town and there are nice walks or cycle rides up to the dam. We stayed Saturday night and there were some jokers letting off fireworks and driving past with their car horns blaring at about 3am which disturbed us but otherwise quiet. However others on here haven’t noted so maybe just a one-off."
16490,2428096,5,marro96,07/10/2022,"We have spent the night here, exactly as the description says. Super quiet and a very charming town."

16490,2417373,2,Red47,02/10/2022,"You sleep well, absolute silence. The toilet drain is horribly clogged and faulty. To fill the water you have to keep the tap pressed."
16490,2414984,4,marpaufel,01/10/2022,"Good area, very quiet. Thank you City Hall. The local business appreciates this type of initiative and the delighted motorhome owners."
16490,2407520,4,MF1,27/09/2022,Along the side of a road this is not a very busy road - we had a very quiet night - the toilet emptying is still out of order

16490,2395310,3,joleen1,22/09/2022,Well marked directions to follow. Plenty of space to park.  Short pleasant walk into lovely town with bars & shops.   Facilities all working well although pity some folk leave the potty area unclean!!
16490,2385213,1,rufach,19/09/2022,"We slept there 2 nights, Saturday night very quiet and Sunday night a bit of traffic from 5am. Area with good services, although there are people who can't read and dump solid waste where they don't touch. Recommended Respect the environment..."

16490,2368019,4,Marylene49,13/09/2022,very functional municipal area. few people are up to date.
16490,2344399,4,txaparrita,06/09/2022,We have been phenomenal. Thank you Aguilar.
16490,2324156,3,terminal15,31/08/2022,"Functional road parking area, quiet and trouble free for the night. Easy walk into the historic centre of the town. Services are complicated for chemical disposal, you must use the drain in the road for waste then rinse at the tap. Also the fresh water tap now has a push fit connector fitted so filling is possible."
16490,2310154,4,Veronica1983,27/08/2022,"Area with all services and well leveled. All full of AC. Beautiful walk along the riverbank, with trails, playgrounds and beautiful views of the dam. Town with a lot of charm and things to visit."
16490,2284298,5,carmengozalo,22/08/2022,very close to the town and quiet little shade at the moment
16490,2270672,5,windalo,20/08/2022,"A 10 for the place. Far enough from the town but at the same time close to walk, water change, enough space, if there are not reserved places, around plenty, picnic area, nearby children's park, etc. I stopped for one night because it was close to the highway and ended up spending two nights."
16490,2251806,5,marieta36,16/08/2022,"very nice area with a walk around the river with which you can reach the town and a gigantic playground. to go with dogs and children great, we have loved the area. good access from the town center, follow directions to the area"
16490,2225879,4,Emimaher,12/08/2022,"The site is very good and quiet and if people were more respectful and didn't occupy two spaces, it would be much better"
16490,2224274,4,HotelRodinhas,12/08/2022,"Wide and comfortable area. The municipal swimming pool is on the other side of the river, approx. 700 meters, it is simple but very nice and with affordable prices. (It is necessary to wear a bathing cap). Thank you for putting areas near sports facilities."
16490,2218067,4,Sobert,11/08/2022,Area in very good condition. With recent expansion to accommodate more motorhomes (although no one parked) There are picnic tables. Near the village. without clotos or buns. There is a fountain and emptying of water. With all the services.
16490,2181640,4,travelban,05/08/2022,"Quiet area to spend the night, nearby city center and swimming pools in summer on the other side of the river. possibility of walks and mountain bike rides. filler tap without thread, attention! the potty is emptied into a box located on the floor and then cleaned at the tap located on the other side of the filling tap."
16490,2170111,3,molamolax,03/08/2022,"It is expanding and has many spaces and if they are covered, it is easy to park next to it on the street. However, it has quite a bit of noise from people passing by, the train and the traffic. The water refill point is not threaded, which makes charging quite difficult. It's also not particularly close to downtown; you can walk but it takes 15 minutes"
16490,2157282,3,JR.,01/08/2022,"Quiet and clean area until someone empties the potty into the drains of the taps instead of the sewer on the ground and leaves it full of shit, they have prepared a piece of grass and tables that are very good to eat or rest for a while."
16490,2136159,4,MartinFidel,28/07/2022,"We spent a quiet night in this area after visiting Aguilar de Campoo. The views from the castle and also from the swamp dam are fantastic. Aguilar is charming. The only downside is directed at some motorhome owners who, due to ignorance or..., empty the poti in the place indicated for cleaning and not emptying it. Thank you Aguilar de Campo."
16490,2128958,4,CapitanClick,27/07/2022,Magnify. Quiet and everything operational. Many thanks Ayto. We will return.
16490,2128889,5,javitori,26/07/2022,"Very good place to spend the night, very quiet area, the emptying and filling area is very well maintained, the Town Hall employees doing maintenance. Very close to the municipal swimming pool and also to the town. Highly recommended."
16490,2128301,5,guti1974,26/07/2022,"Paved area with all free services. Nice walk to the old town. We slept a very quiet night next to other motorhomes. You have to watch where the GPS takes you, because the tunnel next to the area has a height of 2.40."
16490,2095806,5,AnaGirasol,19/07/2022,"Highly recommended area, super quiet area. We have spent 2 nights and without any problem. Next to the river, with a beautiful walk right next to it, are the municipal swimming pools where you can spend the day for 2.50 euros with hot showers. The town is beautiful, it is worth visiting, wandering around because it is beautiful. It has the local gullon cookie shop with an amazing variety."
16490,2075647,5,tamgl84,15/07/2022,"Clean area and with everything very well indicated to empty and fill. Chest for black and tap to clean independent chemical toilet. The filling tap does not have a thread or a lot of pressure but it does its job perfectly. We did not spend the night, we only changed waters but we saw an area with picnic tables on the opposite sidewalk."
16490,2069720,5,Sacupa,13/07/2022,"The area is finished and is next to the water area. I say this because they continue to park in the area that was provisional and the area is much better, apart from the fact that they can say something about the school issue."
16490,2035351,5,traveljw,03/07/2022,Thanks to the community for this parking lot. Adequate for a visit to the city and an overnight stay. Gladly again
16490,1993240,4,JosepPujol,19/06/2022,"Quiet area despite the fact that it is a school area. A little far from the center but in 10 minutes on foot... be careful with the tap socket, it is difficult to put an adapter"
16490,1952396,1,KUN71,06/06/2022,"Improvable area. Next to a school, so it is not suitable if you do not like to get up early. The clean water filling tap is one of those that does not have a quick-coupling mouth. How difficult it is for some municipalities to do things well!"
16490,1948336,1,franciscolorin,05/06/2022,"If you arrive at game or school time you may not get a free place, spaces occupied by cars"
16490,1891389,3,trillonyotero,15/05/2022,"Few spaces and occupied by cars, but we still managed to park, quiet place. Nice town, eating inn Añejo"
16490,1878983,4,Kasku51,09/05/2022,"The area is fine, good location and in a quiet area. The city council should carry out an awareness campaign with parents who go to school to take their children and leave their ""cars lying around"" anywhere, making access-exit difficult and covering the loading and unloading area (it is located on the main street, on the side next to the football field)."
16490,1878088,4,BinomioNomada,08/05/2022,"Good area, with free water and water discharge services. The only bad thing is that it is next to a soccer field and on Sunday mornings there are games from early on and seats are not respected and there is noise. To avoid the access tunnel, it is better to go down Calle Molino Turruntero."
16490,1835013,4,ManuelAvila,18/04/2022,"The area is fine, (more towns with areas would give them life and increase their economy). Near a canal where you can walk, swimming pools and sports areas. We had to park outside because the spaces were occupied, and we had no problems. I do not put 5* because the taps for water loading and toilet cleaning do not allow any adapter, otherwise everything is perfect."
16490,1831260,5,solsticio,17/04/2022,"The area is well located 5 minutes from the center on a pleasant walk along the river, the only drawback is the water filling tap that has no thread and has a lot of pressure, so the adapters for this type of tap jump and you take a shower"
16490,1830764,5,Tonioga,17/04/2022,"Thanks to Aguilar de Campoo for this area. well located to visit the town. Welcoming people. we ate at Cortes, good and abundant."

16490,1820197,4,gawera272,14/04/2022,"Very quiet place full of vans and caravans at Easter. Intake of clean water, discharge of gray and emptying of black water totally free. I have spent a night on the way to Picos de Europa, and great"
16490,1810269,4,cabulmer,08/04/2022,"Good port in easy reach of Santander.  
Good services.
Historic town with supermarkets worth a visit too."
16490,1802697,4,garkar,01/04/2022,"Everything you need here service wise and a quiet night. As others have said go into the town and follow the big blue motorhome area signs and access is easy, even for bigger units. Don't follow sat nav."
16490,1786317,3,franjgr,17/03/2022,"An island with only three road accesses, we don't fit on one, another is narrow, although it goes over and the third forces you to go through the town and go back. Depending on what time you arrive you can find the places for AC full of cars of the parents of children in kindergarten or those who play football. Really no sign prohibits them from parking. Otherwise a short walk from the center, quiet and flat"
16490,1774625,3,sensaciones,05/03/2022,"You have to enter through the town, not through the tunnel walk. Unfortunately there is no sign warning of the height limitation."
16490,1771564,4,bettyboop29700,02/03/2022,ns have only made a stop to visit the city. But a big thank you to the city which provides free services except electricity and an air to park and spend the night
16490,1768165,3,chicotina,27/02/2022,"The GPS played tricks on us, incorrect entry, everything else was perfect. Source and emptying of grays and blacks ok."
16490,1765827,4,LeoDipacce,25/02/2022,"Practical parking, we were able to unload gray and black perfectly, the black ones as the sign on the YELLOW BOX says, water loading without problems, the tap does not have a thread, but with a simple adapter with a quick coupling for this type of tap and that's it . Inconvenient to get there since the GPS sent us through Paseo el Soto, a few meters from getting there there is a height limit of 2.4mt"
16490,1720581,4,Lafamiliacrece,30/12/2021,"To this day, everything works correctly. Clean waters are loaded from a gray box on the ground (it is indicated), to clean the chemical if the sink was clogged, but a yellow box is indicated on the ground, so, no problem. Everything ok."
16490,1717889,2,rakeleta,28/12/2021,"It seems that they have replaced the tap but it is useless to carry water, it does not have a thread where you can hook the hose and you directly take a shower in it; We filled a jug and we filled the tank from the inside. Given that previously there was a faucet, it has not been ignorance to replace something that does not fulfill its function ... intended so that water is not wasted?"
16490,1705659,2,montanes68,07/12/2021,"Emptying grays was not a problem, emptying blacks, it was not a problem either lifting the lid of the box that is on the ground and putting a knee on tar to empty the potti. The tap to clean the potti does not work, they have ripped off the other one, the box to clean potti clogged with water and papers, so it is difficult to fill water. It needs maintenance by the City Council."
16490,1705108,4,Mikelcc,07/12/2021,"We spent one night. Flat parking with good services: differentiated black and gray water discharge, as well as differentiated clean water taps and toilets. A pity that while we were parking, some kids broke the tap with a kick. There is an influx of people like that on weekends as we could see."
16490,1704420,4,natxitua,06/12/2021,"read well, sewage in YELLOW ARQUETTE ON THE FLOOR Grifo Roto would ask the city council to repair it because the site is ideal for visiting the town and making routes. very grateful, it deserves to spend in this town!"

16490,1641838,4,gabilandia,12/10/2021,"We spent 2 nights, one in the own area at the door of the nursery and another in the parking spaces that are right in front of it because it was full. Both nights quiet but one night some noise from cars and motorcycles speeding down the street. Ideal for visiting the city. Paste, the tap that is not threaded and that I would ask the town hall to change it."
16490,1637695,3,GolfLimaBravo,10/10/2021,The area is very good BUT THE WATER FILLING TAP HAS NO THREAD AND YOU CANNOT PUT A HOSE ONLY with this change and that is not pressing but a manual valve I give it five stars
16490,1622881,2,RatonCantabria,02/10/2021,"They've changed the set up here for changing waters, and it's not good now - which is really silly as it used to be great! We gave up trying to fill with water, the taps are awful - even for black water. Much better services in Herrera to the south and Cervera to the west - both of those are excellent. What a shame Aguilar - living 20 minutes away this used to be a regular water stop for us!"
16490,1619225,4,rulandovoy,30/09/2021,"Be careful, the GPS takes you through a tunnel of 2.40 meters ... Area a short walk from the center of town. It is a bit small, now at the end of September it was full. otherwise, it is quiet, except in the morning when you are woken up by the parents' cars that take the child to the school that is stuck."
16490,1612851,4,CalViudo,27/09/2021,"Correct and quiet area at night. At the entrance and exit of the schools, there is a movement of cars but they leave immediately. The sewage drainage system is not the most suitable and would be easy to improve without a major investment. The drive to the center is quite nice, with a walk near the river."
16490,1610069,3,lanjana,26/09/2021,"The taps have so much water pressure that even if you separate, you get a shower and if you are washing the pot ... well, you get full of shit !!! It is also impossible to load water in a simple bottle. Having the sewage drainage box is a real fudge. They all have them in the same place where here it is ONLY TO WASH the pot"
16490,1602913,4,elrafaelillo,23/09/2021,"We have done very well. The issue of parked cars is because it is at the door of a nursery and at the time of entry or exit of the children, there are parked cars, but if you wait a little while, you will have it totally clear of cars."
16490,1598292,5,andresm61,21/09/2021,"A very well-kept, quiet and free area, with water services, but without nearby toilets. It is next to a soccer field and today I have seen many cars that park in the area to pick up their children or whatever, and there are very few spaces, so you can find it full of cars, although they are not usually stay a long time. The quiet night."

16490,1287693,4,carideperez,30/06/2021,Perfect for all services. As the previous comment says in parties they cut the street although there is an alternative route through a small narrow bridge.
16490,1286278,5,Michelfs,30/06/2021,It is very good to load / unload water (gray / black) and clean the van for free. They are festivals at the end of June and with the fairs they close a street but there is access by a narrow bridge. Be careful if the GPS sends you through another entrance with a tunnel of 2.4m maximum height because you have to turn around.
16490,1285051,4,vagabundavan,29/06/2021,"No shadows, but on June 29 the air is very cool. 20th at 3:00 p.m. From June 23 to 29 they are the patron saint festivities and they put out little gadgets shortly before reaching the area, it was difficult for us to enter because they had closed the access street, but we could access through another nearby street.

16512,182363,3,willvy,22/08/2017,"The parking area is abandoned, although there are more suitable areas with less unevenness in its vicinity. The only usefulness of the area is to see La Cueva del Tesoro, they are visitable caves of marine origin. Although its state is abandoned due to poor maintenance, it is pleasant to visit for its beauty."

16524,3150328,3,RVJD,15/08/2023,"Area to spend the night, not paved, very quiet, level, it can be unloaded and loaded clean. The problem is that the parking area is very small, it seems that more space is planned. Children's playground. A five-minute walk away there is a restaurant, La Casilla, which I cannot recommend, regular cuisine and I had to claim a 25% overprice on the bill"

16524,2959689,3,FrancescaBigarelli,13/07/2023,"Quiet camper area, due to the works there are only three actual pitches. There is no real sewage drain so they must be emptied into the gray water grid. There is no standard water tap attachment so impossible to attach your own hose."

16524,2545299,2,DaisyAndOlaf,07/01/2023,"Small, there were already three ac parked and the grass is quite uneven. It gets you out of trouble with the toilets but it smelled bad, the black water is disposed of through the same grids as the gray water, lifting it up at the end. There is no source for the potty, we always have an 8-liter bottle to use in these cases. Please do not use the drinking fountain."

16524,2448568,5,freeryda,17/10/2022,"Great! I don't think electricity should be free, but ok, well meant. Great water supply, large connection is needed (you should just have it, don't complain with 1 star like other comments...). Black water goes into the same drain as gray water - to do this, lift the grid on the right edge. Please do not tip into the public toilet!"

16524,2286872,5,asm9,22/08/2022,"Electricity, water, level plots, toilets nearby (pretty good) and park nearby. Very calm. Not a noise or passing cars at night. Once the plots are filled (2 more or less) there is much more space in the field. We were 7 vans in the same night and some more would enter. PS: the stars looked amazing!"

16524,2139362,3,McClonles,29/07/2022,"Ok for one night, if you can deal with a lot of barking dogs during the night and during the day and general noise, rooster, train etc. and you can also leave some distance to others if everything is still free, why are there always these cuddly campers? What's the matter with you?"
16524,2093836,2,Macsea,19/07/2022,Area not level. You park on the grass. There is only one faucet that is used for cleaning sewage and drinking water. Somewhat out of town. They run electrical wires over your head.

16524,1975041,3,hsnaps,13/06/2022,"Always grateful for free Aires, but there's only so much you can want to sleep on a bit of disused land next to a sewage plant so it's hard to give this a higher rating. It was tricky to know how best to park to make the best use of the space, and not much of the area was flat. It did the job for a stopover, but not a particularly nice spot to spend any actual time in."
16524,1918142,3,PepeQuilis,26/05/2022,"Very well for the municipality of Goitiriz, a small but well-kept area, with toilets, water, and a playground for children. Great and let other localities take note that it does not cost much to have an area in good condition."

There are two dogs in the farm next door, alone all day frozen to death. I don't understand how there are people with no heart either. Having dogs in the empty farm for nothing."

For the draining of sewage, it is in the gray grid itself, on the left side it is written on the floor (half erased) WC, it was quite difficult for us to find it."

16559,768585,2,GLUECKsMUSKEL,14/01/2020,"We wanted to charge our batteries for one night while enjoying the convenience of a shower with unlimited hot water. Although the homepage says that the ACSI card is accepted, this was not the case. We paid 23, - because I know other places that are significantly better and cheaper, such as Rosaleda in Conil. The receptionist was a bit chaotic. You can not choose a place freely, although there was a lot free, but is allocated. Stupid if the lady is wrong in the number. The sanitary facilities are clean, but have had better times and the shower could have more water pressure. It is of course stupid if I go to a CP because of the electricity and then there is a power failure. The electricity could not be restored until noon. I was offered the opportunity to stay longer. But nobody could tell me when there would be electricity again. I still had to pay the full price, even without electricity."

There is also access to a water terminal and there is everything you need for selective sorting for the various types of waste. The place is very spacious enough to accommodate several motorhomes without feeling like they are on top of each other. You can take a walk to the nearby castle.
16571,2080999,1,SPIZA,16/07/2022,"Parking under the Butrón castle. I went years ago and I took a photo with the van under it with no problems. I wanted to repeat the photo this year with the new van and it was impossible. A man parked in the middle, who said he was the guard, prohibited and screwed up the photo under threat of a fine for being private property. But walking you can pass quietly and do what you want strange things in life."

16580,2446867,4,ourvanhelsing,16/10/2022,"Surprisingly pleasant stop in a half-built urbanisation on the outskirts of this beautiful old ""Camino"" town. It can slope front to back and, side to side, but nothing that well-placed chocks can't handle. The only down sides were the persistent flies and the very weak internet signal. Many thanks to the Ayuntamiento."

Regarding the irrigation that they have commented in some comment, we have not seen them working in the two nights that we have spent, they have not been turned on at any time.

16635,3275335,5,EmyBikeWorldPiera,09/09/2023,Ideal parking to visit the park and be calm with the car. There is a lack of shade and at night there are many lampposts and too much light otherwise great 40e all services and light. The bathrooms are very clean. 100% recommended
16635,3266894,4,Oskarin,07/09/2023,"I'll start with the bad, which is only the price (€40/night booking by phone) and that's it. Everything else is good: spacious and with services (electricity, bathrooms, showers, sinks and washing machine). It is PERFECT for visiting Port Aventura, accessing directly through the hotel, and being able to use its swimming pools. I insist: PERFECT. But be careful, it's a parking lot, so you can't take out tables, awnings, or anything like that."
16635,3255720,4,PauloMozBarbosa,03/09/2023,"€40 if booking made by phone or email. I left the reception with the suggestion that they identify the ESA taps: the one below with the toilet and the other with drinking water. And, of course, in a climate like this there is a lack of shadows."

BBQ prohibited. access to the car park also gives the right to use the swimming pool of the River Gold hotel. however a little expensive (50 euros per night) but very practical."
16635,3180435,5,AnaM8,19/08/2023,"Phenomenal! Better to book by phone by calling the park as the price per night is €40 instead of €50. It includes parking for the day of the park which is worth €14. It is not allowed to remove chairs or awnings, or hang clothes outside. Possibility to walk around the hotel and use the services of swimming pools and restaurants, there are also animations for children."
16635,3141070,4,carfil,13/08/2023,A little expensive. But that's the price of safety while you're at the park
16635,3137193,1,chrispn33620,13/08/2023,Attention do not take unapproved vans even if you are completely autonomous or in the process of approval validation. So we fall back on the parking lot next door.

16635,3099101,1,JCG59,08/08/2023,"Overpriced in my opinion for just parking, because nothing can be installed outside. I parked further on a free spot for the same result. (You just have to anticipate the full of water and have emptied the cassette)."

16635,3016005,5,ici27,25/07/2023,Great. Very comfortable to visit port aventura. Near the park. You can use the hotel pool. Bathrooms and others clean. Very friendly staff. The entrance parking area package is unbeatable in price. You spend two nights and if you want a third you stay in the parking lot. I wish there were more areas like this. And with light in the square.
16635,3012843,5,lesdecouvreurs,24/07/2023,"given the access to the surrounding DCs, this one is really good. we advise you to book by phone, this allows a reduction on entrance tickets to the caribbean park of 20% for a family of 4 including children of 7 and 3 years old we paid 116e for the night and access to the park and access to the swimming pool of the hotel next door. the sanitary facilities are very clean and spacious, but no shade."

It is recommended to be there 10-15 minutes before the park opens and ride 1 in the attraction that usually has the longest queue"
16635,2921881,4,cocozoemario,04/07/2023,"good facilities, they could improve the showers and put changing rooms because when the park closed many of us got together and it was a bit of a hassle and the price was a bit high with the payment of the tickets"

16635,2762600,4,bouille84,19/05/2023,"Good price if you also take the seats. That makes us 2 days 2 parks 2 nights for 204€. But if you just take the night it's 50€/night. Sanitary clean but a bit shabby. Ascent. 1st night we were 6, a little more then. 100 parking spaces. 5 emptying and filling spots. Electricity at all pitches. For the last night we must have left for 10am, but they gave us a free parking ticket to park in the Port Aventura car park. She told us that in high season when it's full, it's forbidden to take out chairs, tables, etc., but there it's allowed because it's low season!"

You have to leave before 10 in the morning and they give you a pass to park at the main entrance of the park. From the area you can see a shopping center on the other side of the road but we didn't go and I don't know how far it will be walking. All very well.
16635,2669762,4,squale73,14/04/2023,Clean area and very pleasant staff. The showers are hot and clean. Close to the park. Possible entry and exit without any problem.

The running water tap lacks a quick coupling and the black water tap lacks a 20cm piece of hose so that the water does not splash and thus be able to identify each tap. In the showers there is a shelf to put the gels and a hanger before entering them. Washing dishes outdoors in INV or VER, wrong, it is not roofed."

16635,2519873,5,Radiio2,11/12/2022,One of the best areas I have found. With really clean toilets and showers. With washing area and hot water. Guarded 24 hours by very friendly staff. With the entrance to Port Aventura 10 euros per night. All the services.
16635,2487194,4,zucche,08/11/2022,"The bad thing is that even to empty it, you have to pay the full amount of €35. Luckily, the guy at the reception was very kind and let us do just the porta potty for free."
16635,2471026,2,Marina87x,30/10/2022,"The area very well, but the access HORRIBLE. You have to check-in (I don't understand why) and an hour and a half in the queue just for that. I don't think it's worth it just to access services. In addition, the price is very expensive: 45 euros per night."
16635,2470763,4,castmember,30/10/2022,"Perfect welcome, clean sanitary facilities but to be reviewed at the level of the showers, parking good if not too crowded, and close enough to the park with the possibility of returning to the motorhome if necessary.

16635,2290163,2,elcegri,23/08/2022,"The services are very well maintained, but it is not worth paying 45 euros just to sleep one night in the park, during the day if you want to go to eat in the motorhome it is very far and there are no shadows, so in summer it is horrible if you have no air"

As long as you don't bring a power adapter...5€ more for rent. to go to the park... you have to move in the van to another parking lot.

The toilets are not clean and if you want to take a shower at the end of the park you will have to be patient, 3 showers on the women's side. The positive point is the access to the park by the hotel where you can benefit from the swimming pool."

And there is staff at the reception 24 hours a day, they sell it as a package, entry and night. More information by phone from PortAventura, if you buy by booking it is a very good price.

16635,1910399,5,Lunila,23/05/2022,"The best option to go to Portaventura, a 5-minute walk and you enter through the hotel, not through the park entrance, so you save the queues. The spaces are fair but if you go to the park you are not in the car all day, so it does not matter. You can use the hotel pools. Good service area and toilets, recommended."

At 8 a.m. when we woke up the parking lot was full. The spot is well in troubleshooting, but if you want to be quiet this will not be the case. On the other hand, great if you want to go hiking early in the morning!"
16708,2341984,5,PompelleChloe,05/09/2022,We entered the parking lot with a 2.04 meter van and there was still about ten centimeters above it I would say. We didn't stay to sleep
16708,2250845,4,Van_atope,16/08/2022,"Great place, calm and shaded on evening and night. 4 vans parked. At 9am there where more than 70 cars of walkers."
16708,2166021,4,Jacquottour,03/08/2022,The 2-3 places before the car park are no longer available because they are locked with a chain. Indeed in the morning it is better to arrive before 8 a.m. if you want space and park so that you can leave because people also park in the central one way
16708,2057131,4,VincVan,10/07/2022,"Shaded parking, very pleasant to spend the night. From 8:00 am, the parking lot fills with hikers. No ban, we slept with 3 other vans"
16708,1662916,4,thibetrem,26/10/2021,A few places for motorhomes or vans before entering the car park (2-3). We arrived around 8:30 p.m. Perfect place for the ascent of the Rhune the next day. On the parking lot itself impossible at most 2 m.

16708,1092269,1,satur26,13/10/2020,Parking limited to 2 m in height. right at the entrance there is a fairly flat hole where three or four motorhomes enter. This place is ideal to start the walk to Mount Larrun

16708,105732,4,LucieD35,17/09/2016,"We spent 2 nights in early September, very quiet (1 or 2 other vans / motorhomes). During the day, the car park is full with the hikers' cars but in the evening, it empties quickly. Perfect to enjoy the area!"
16708,102563,3,chrisomz,03/09/2016,In fact being at that of La Chapelle (700 m) we passed by to hike to the Rhune. That of La Chapelle is much more pleasant even if there is also shade there but it is very quickly full

The area is an ancient culture where archaeological habitation has been found dating back to 2500 BC. We hope to discover some of it. It is a small campsite with an extremely sympathetic manager. He explained everything on the campsite and did a round. Neatly clean sanitary facilities.

The village of Coca is also worth seeing, especially the castle. The campsite is beautiful, quiet and in the middle of the woods. Sanitary facilities are neatly arranged. Nothing to note. Restaurant is small and not open every day in preseason."

Excellent cleanliness, very correct plots, incredible restaurant and the owners, Berta and David ....... a show of people.

16772,3240389,2,MarilinaRibas,30/08/2023,"I only give it two stars because in the water change area the black water mixes with the gray water and the drain smells terrible. I don't know if it is poorly designed or broken, but currently it is a mess. Otherwise, the location is good and the squares are fairly level."
16772,3238582,2,sarabara,30/08/2023,We went to empty the motorhome. Free services but very poorly designed. The gray water goes to a sewer that is overflowing with water and when you are cleaning the poty it communicates with that sewer and absolutely everything comes out. He has to fix it since it's a real filth.
16772,3225493,4,rafaydana,27/08/2023,Well located to get to know the city. All operational services. The gray drain a little poorly designed. Thanks to the municipality.
16772,3222386,1,SOLILLUNA,26/08/2023,Parking near the center full of cars that do not respect spaces for AC. It is not an area. The town hall should put order. Thanks
16772,3221014,5,SoniaRF,26/08/2023,"Ideal location, behind the monastery and next to the river. The loading area is very clean, to say the least, the clean water pressure needs to be improved a little, but wow, thanks for everything to Casalarreina. Last weekend of August, festivals in the town. We have been great."
16772,3159700,4,PakitoCalvo,16/08/2023,"Super quiet, free water filling and emptying. The municipal swimming pools are next door. Thanks to the people of Casalarreina for this area."
16772,3146268,4,zorykitty,14/08/2023,A fantastic place to spend a few hours of rest. It is attached to the municipal swimming pool that for €2.5 you can take a good bath or sunbathe in summer. Two minutes away is the river where if you have a dog it will appreciate a dip. Thanks to the town hall for thinking of us.
16772,3134144,3,LaChatinaVan,13/08/2023,"Thanks to the Casalarreina City Council for this area, it is very well connected to the center, and the place is nice near the river. It has filling and emptying water. We will repeat but not in summer and on weekends, there were many people gathered on the courts and until 2AM there was a lot of noise, at 8AM there were already people training. Surely outside of the summer season it is easier to rest."
16772,3086572,4,borjasl,06/08/2023,"It is the parking area of the sports area and swimming pools. A couple of minutes from the center, with many bars in the square. At night the kids get together on the soccer field and there's a bit of a ruckus until 12 or so."
16772,3055623,4,RitaMiranda,01/08/2023,It's not the quietest place to spend the night but it's well located. The longer motorhomes may have a problem parking.
16772,3054904,5,MGViajar,01/08/2023,"Great place to be in Casalarreina, next to the pools with gray and black water filling and cleaning service and very quiet at night. There are swings nearby and a greenway to Ezkaray. We will return without a doubt."

16848,2226743,3,Mowflow,13/08/2022,"The parking lot was ""rehabilitated"", everything was only smoothed out once with an excavator. The ground is flat, but there are potholes. But perfectly adequate for one night. During the day there are joggers, people with dogs and the occasional car using the road. At night, however, there is almost nothing going on."
16848,2189632,3,xeilagiralt,07/08/2022,"Quiet and good place for one night. There is a lot of movement of people, especially athletes and some cars from early in the morning until 8:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. If you want to be calm, we recommend that you wake up early. For the rest, the river is not very attractive for bathing, and the parking lot is sandy and has many holes, so we do not recommend it if there is forecast of rain."
16848,2159998,5,hermannunddieherren,02/08/2022,Better than the place directly at the restaurant where there is a lot more going on. Less beautiful but quieter

16848,1024338,4,magdass,04/09/2020,"Yes, it is accessed by an asphalt road with a dead-end road sign. Easy to pass with AC. There are 2 more car parks nearby but this one is more reserved. We slept alone and great. In the evening people walk with dogs or do sports. At night not a soul until 7 in the morning. There are trees that provide shade. A beautiful castle is a 5-minute walk away."

16849,3122670,1,marine07200,11/08/2023,"How to say in view of the comments we tried it was the nth spot at CC that we tried because everything was sold out. We left so early, plenty of space yes, but very poorly attended parking lots of caravans (live all year round?)"

16849,1876047,4,Sirgokhan,07/05/2022,"Correct site, to be free and so close to the town. The problem is that it is made of gravel, very dusty, I suppose that when it rains it gets awful and the start is quite bumpy and deep. Let's see if they fill them soon."

16849,298524,2,nicolasd44,23/07/2018,A large car park and almost flat. A circus settles so it will be difficult to park at this time. I was stolen my road sign at the back. Pleasant beach but uninteresting village.

16850,3189040,1,air081,20/08/2023,"The truth is a shame, the enclave is extraordinary and if it had another management it would be one of the best places to really be, but Esq the management is REGRETABLE, dirty, smell of dog pee everywhere, playground full of cigarette butts, plots very small…A real pity. The noise issue we had a lot of fuss until 24:00 but then the truth is that nothing."
16850,3154474,1,adrianarenasb,15/08/2023,"I give it one star because you can't give it any, I felt cheated. Plots for camper vans and motorhomes on cement, very expensive prices, no coverage, the shower with cold water, they do not answer the phone, etc... Any option is better than this campsite, the only good thing is the views and that it has a pool."
16850,3141077,1,frjmb,13/08/2023,"Very bad campsite at a premium campsite price. They charge you 67 euros per camper for 2 people and electricity per night. Triple as expensive as others, and this one above the plots are on cement, the water in the showers is frozen, the lady at the reception is very very very unfriendly."
16850,3114602,1,NaiaraBalenciaga,10/08/2023,"Camping not recommended. Chaotic, noisy, dirty, the camper pitches are asphalt parking lots. They charge the girl at the adult price, having delivered the ID, and when claiming it the answer is: €2 total. For the pool you have to get a separate ticket. The workers walk around the campsite on very noisy motorcycles. The showers with almost cold water. The only good thing is the views."
16850,3110408,1,MarionHoerr,09/08/2023,"Not recommended for mobile homes in the season! Lady at the reception very unfriendly, most places are mobile homes. The driveway is a dead end, turning around is hardly possible due to too many parked vehicles."
16850,3045447,3,Jesusvalde77,30/07/2023,"Most of the pitches are on concrete and they give you 2 pitches so you can open the awning but if you get there early you can get on grass. Motorhome, 2 adults and 2 children are €54 and electricity is eleven euros more apart. There is hardly any coverage. Cold water in showers. Beach 15 minutes walking."
16850,3035681,3,PaquiPerez,28/07/2023,"I have just been to this campsite. A motorhome, electricity, a small dog and 2 adults €56.20. Very expensive. Very small pitches for large motorhomes, difficult to leave in the morning due to the accumulation of parked cars. Some great views."

No plots, bathrooms and showers in a deplorable state and frozen water, no coverage, cash payments, expensive prices and bad food, noise until 12, swimming pool not included and full, deplorable staff. I took a place for the van. When she arrived, she was busy. I called reception and they refused to take the car out or refund my money for that night. Full review on GMaps."
16850,2949171,4,carlosnaya,11/07/2023,"Very complete campsite, ideal to spend a good night with views of the sea. Spectacular sunset while you dine. The only bad thing is that the caravan area is very close to the bar and they are open until late as in all campsites, otherwise highly recommended."
16850,2907000,1,meltibo,30/06/2023,"TO FLEE !!!!! 54 euros for a place in the parking lot between the other motorhomes for our car with roof tent. On the ground we slalom between cigarette ends and dog poop, bathroom room, nothing to heat something (apart from a barbecue) w lots of people and teenagers running around until late at night, the only which are good are the tents which are on the bottom of the cliff with a beautiful sea view."
16850,2889827,1,blesle,25/06/2023,Only suitable for small vans. We payed 65 euros for 1 night. pitch was so narrow could not open garage door to take out chairs. Advice Don't stop it's a bit of a Kip.
16850,2813480,1,Jurbar,02/06/2023,There were 3 dog droppings in the very narrow space that was initially assigned to us... And that for just under €50 with electricity!
16850,2585850,2,fred1960,21/02/2023,"Only plus side was the proximity to the sea. The pitches are not managed at this time of year and we couldn’t fit into our allocated pitch. Noisy at night at the weekend. It appeared that visitors from outside came, BBQ and played loud music! Dog poo around. Bathrooms dated, no hot water for washing dishes or clothes. Paid €38 per night for small Campervan, 2 adults and electric hook up."
16850,2549809,3,r.thormann,12/01/2023,"mega location, mega view, mega price. Use the second entrance, about 100 m further on the right. If possible, drive to the lower pitches, this is where the view is best. old facility, old sanitary area, but clean. we were alone on the pitches on January 11th, which probably has something to do with the price of €43 for two adults, electricity and a dog."
16850,2534506,3,coppertone,30/12/2022,"For clarification: There are 2 entrances! The 2nd is without height limit. Between Christmas and New Year it is the only open space within a 50km radius. The view is spectacular, but so is the price! The bar is quite nice. The restaurant terrible. But at the lighthouse there is a nice restaurant with very chilled employees, funny but also acceptable food."
16850,2533726,4,ElisaLavigne,30/12/2022,"good campsite, we paid €30 for 2 adults for a Magnificent van with a view of the sea the sanitary facilities are clean, WC emptying pitch -: the van pitches are free of choice, if you choose a pitch and go for a walk with your vehicle you may not have any more room when you return The employees do not speak French or English"

amazing!"

16850,2290176,1,kelitajotita,23/08/2022,"It is the anti-camping... The space for large AC is minimal (we could not get an awning or table and chairs. The man who attends you, does it with fair education and once you pay you do not look for him anymore, because he does not return you the call or it takes you long to solve a problem. The location is very good, it has great views. The bar looks at it from the outside."
16850,2251620,1,CCfred,16/08/2022,"we arrived on August 15 at 4 p.m. initially satisfied to have the last place for our cc. Very quickly, we are disappointed, we park in a car park inside the campsite, little space. Nice view but too many people, too much noise. dirty sanitary facilities, campsite attendance calls out! very expensive, not worth this price."
16850,2173438,3,AlYMo,04/08/2022,"Beautiful views. Staff at the entrance and the restaurant below very well. The restaurant on the left was fatal. We went down and went up to the sea through the campsite, you need to be in shape. August. Little shade. It is not the type of camping that we like."
16850,2172890,4,fiishnchips,04/08/2022,I stayed here with a tent at the end of April 2022 - amazing views and extremely quiet and fairly empty this early in the year. 1 star deduction for relatively unkempt sanitary facilities - the price-performance ratio doesn't fit.
16850,2132273,2,EnVadrouille68,27/07/2022,"1 star for the great view. No shaded place. Pitch with view on grass for tents and on parking for motorhomes, not very warm. Clean sanitary facilities"
16850,2112186,2,kamperenischill,23/07/2022,"The description of this campsite starts with “small”… it isn't. It is an uninviting campsite where your neighbors are so close that you sit at the table together. The view is fantastic, unfortunately you can't reach the sea because of the rocks. We did have a delicious meal in the adjacent village of San Sebastián, this was certainly worth something. I wouldn't go back to this campsite, lots of noise simmered through the night partly due to the cramped pitches. the"
16850,2066689,2,pickup96,13/07/2022,"The two stars are only for the nice staff. The campsite is totally overcrowded, the wrong choice for people who want to sleep. The party goes on late into the night and cars drive across the square. There was also a big fight at the restaurant. The sanitary facilities could be cleaner and the showers can only have one temperature (very hot)."
16850,1923466,4,ShanThoom,28/05/2022,"We first stopped at the free camper spot just under the lighthouse. But we wanted an ocean view.
The owner let us check out the camping first, so we got to see if we had an ocean view, and boy did we!
Sanitary facilities were fine, but it wasn't busy in this period."
16850,1910689,3,Carlos.Ern,23/05/2022,"The campsite is beautifully situated, but the access road is not entirely unproblematic for large campers. The 1st passage is limited to 2.6m but the very friendly receptionist can open the gate a bit further back so there is no height restriction. The pitches are quite narrow or you stand on a concrete slab with a view of the sea. Sanis old but ok"
16850,1841511,1,Laikak209,20/04/2022,"If the height is limited to 2.60 m, it is not suitable for most motorhomes. It would be necessary to put camping or parking or whatever is only suitable for small vans, not motorhomes."
16850,1790307,3,AmariYoga,21/03/2022,"Here you pay for the beautiful view. Almost 60€ for 2 nights in the low season we found almost a bit too much. Sanitary facilities would be okay, but could be a lot cleaner. The water does not drain away in the shower. Nice was the proximity to the sea and the trail behind the square where you can walk for miles along the coast. owner was friendly. Okay for a stopover"
16850,1705503,2,cabapunti,07/12/2021,"Totally agree with the previous comments, old and neglected facilities, out of the way of the city and very expensive drinks in the restaurant (2 bottles of toasted beer € 7). As a location it is fine, but nothing out of the ordinary."
16850,1638199,3,roseroma,11/10/2021,Nice location if a bit run down. To get to know Hondarribia we had to call a taxi which cost us 13e each way.
16850,1560513,3,Hectorsyncro,08/09/2021,"If there is no other option it is fine to spend the night. Somewhat fair pitches, I think it is more focused on long stays, friendly receptionist, old and very dirty bathrooms (used by bar customers etc etc ...) concerts and parties in the two bars of the campsite. I think that for a tent it is a much better option than for a van / caravan, since there is a better place and with better views of the coast."
16850,1450610,2,Zafak,13/08/2021,"The location is spectacular, but if it's full they put you in a concrete parking lot full of cigarette butts. It is a dirty campsite with a lot of noise at night. They have a different entrance for vehicles over 2.60 high. The camping area is ""a man for himself."" I suppose that in low season it will be something else ..."
16850,1310799,1,JosemiCuenca,10/07/2021,"They have a limit of 2.60 meters in height at the entrance, we come in AC, we are forced to turn around, there may be somewhere to park near this campsite as there is a lot of influx of cars"
16850,1268758,2,JoseAlias,21/06/2021,"The treatment by the staff is very good, and the views of the campsite are spectacular, but if it is full as was our case, it is a horrible campsite, the toilets are old and, due to the type of people who frequent them, very dirty. If it is to petar and you do not have another place ahead, but that you know what there is."

16850,851488,1,noelaga,06/07/2020,"Bittersweet experience, what a pity that the spectacular views that the campsite has are the only memory that we take from this place because the management is lousy. Because of its light socket, the one closest to the toilets in the parking for vans and caravans, we burned the plate of the switchboard of our van and also the charger of the laptop when at the same time the fuses tripped, a lot of coincidence, right? The owner did not deign to speak to us and the employees were flattened, hopefully the claims continue their course ..."
16850,844900,1,Maxxbull,02/07/2020,"Terrible attention, a lot of arrogance on the part of the owner and his family. Walking your dog and urinating on your plot. I would definitely not recommend it to anyone. I would never repeat. Bad atmosphere in the camping bar with local people drunk and arguing and screaming."
16850,768304,3,AnneTheke,13/01/2020,"The place seems somehow loveless, because it is getting old and apparently only the bare minimum. The sanitary facilities were not our thing: probably those who have their bathroom with them. The parking space was only occupied by three WoMos at the beginning of January, so that the really fantastic view was clear, but for 2 people, 1 WoMo, 2 dogs and electricity, 35 euros were unfortunately too expensive."

Sanitary old but clean."
16850,661482,1,xavialpi,26/08/2019,Camping very little prepared for motorhomes. The emptying of grays in a grid of the street in the middle of the plots and the chemical just hooked to other plots. Camping for free camping and mobile homes throughout the year. We will not return.
16850,600524,2,at2sttu1,05/08/2019,"nice camp-site with superb sight on the sea when one is in tent, but sites for CC and vans near the toilets to be avoided: one is just near the bar restaurant, and music thoroughly until midnight, as well as the coming and going for the sanitary."

But really expensive (40 € 2 adults and 2 children) and 0 service. Beach is far away. Not clean. We got a place right in front of the toilets and people crossed our place. The surface for camping cars is asphalt and they are as big as like parking places = though we used 2 and nobody complained. For camping with tent it could be propably nice."

There is a mini market, a bar and the sanitary facilities are tidy."

We are working on it but it is progressing slowly. Many trees bear some kind of burrs that can leave unsightly spots. The grey/black water supply is very poor. You need a hose for greywater, there is no ramp. The E-points are sometimes far: >30m"

The shower and toilets were clean but I had a shower that only gave cold water.

Price difference depending on the length of the CC and supplement for the trailer almost € 6. The token for the washing machine is also € 6. The village of Evora is very pretty, it is worth a detour."

Note: AC service station is not working."

16851,1171405,1,Casse-dent,10/04/2021,"The new ""management"" clearly leaves something to be desired, as well as the general maintenance of the campsite, swimming pool accessible to people from outside without any security, no respect for the rules, shouts, music etc ... The detestable welcome. Small precision, Dona Maria left the management, the couple replacing her has no skills, invites her family during the weekend ..."

16851,1020571,4,Kayeyettella,02/09/2020,"A little aging campsite, but the cleanliness of the sanitary facilities (important for us !!) earns it a few points! The pitches are quite small and have little shade. The pool is nice, and hot which is rare! On the other hand I do not know if it is due to the COVID restrictions, but the swimming pool and the snack bar opened and closed at non-regular hours ... We stayed there one night, and paid 28 € for a van 2 adults and 2 children. Also note the prohibitive price of washing machines: € 6."

It is true that until twelve o'clock there were cars with some music, but they were far away and did not bother too much. Natural area with a walk from Punta Galea to Sopelana that is worth doing. It has a gauge control for 2.2m, be careful with the height of the vehicle. We want to repeat."

I do not recommend.

16877,1486470,5,martagarreta,20/08/2021,All perfect. The police passed but said nothing. There is a height limitation of 2.2mts. We also met some guys who had been there for 4 nights and they told us that the only thing the police ask is that you don't have everything out of the car. There is a beautiful path from the parking lot that takes you to the beach.

16881,3162744,5,vwafrica,16/08/2023,"One of the best campsites we have been to! Super location, more than reasonable in size with small private bungalow including shower, toilet and electricity. Outside water pipes and small private sink. Table and two chairs available as well as light outside on the plot. Access to the not insignificant swimming pool in the middle of August!"
16881,3151199,4,lavadrouilleuse,15/08/2023,"very nice campsite but impossible to pitch the tent and fix the feet of the awning. I have never seen such hard ground! The small toilet blocks on each pitch can be a plus, but I haven't found it! The sink was partly clogged and the stone sink outside badly done! For a one night stopover it does!"
16881,3147193,5,Olabarria,14/08/2023,Very good campsite! Very good pool and pleasant treatment very familiar! Good services for the price paid! €28 night motorhome and two people!

Two beds, a bathroom and a terrace with table and chair (for eating). Car park in front of bungalow. Very calm place. Pool opens at 11:00 -a bit late. night table lamp, hair dryer - very old & destroyed. All in all a good stopover to rest. And much better then sleeping in my tent at 35 degree at night!"
16881,3105905,5,balasos,09/08/2023,"Very cheap campsite for what it offers, everything very clean, own bathroom on the plot, large pitches, the ground is a bit hard for a tent, a large pool on the premises (Olympic size). We had a good night but it was very hot in August, I recommend it"

16881,2969146,5,Moleta82,15/07/2023,"Super quiet campsite, with extensive pool hours (from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.). There is a private bathroom and sink in each plot, as well as tables and chairs. You can go by bus to the city center. Very friendly staff. Ideal for a stop on the way if you travel to the South."
16881,2951360,4,Coonan,11/07/2023,It’s very handy for bus to Caceres. The individual bathroom s certainly unique but I’d actually prefer to go to a nice modern block. It isn’t in the most attractive location either. But if you are there when Acsi is valid then it’s a good price and gets 4 stars.
16881,2909072,5,capitangelato,30/06/2023,"Simply amazing!! You have a large 'parcela'/camping place with your own personal wc/shower (warm water)! Swimming pool, restaurant, self-service, plus all services for a camper car. Price is 18 euro per night with any camping card - but each 3 nights, the 4th is offered, so you actually pay around 14 euros per night! Staff is very gentle and welcoming, too!"
16881,2905983,5,Mariska74,29/06/2023,"A nice campsite. Dry and sandy, but that is part of the climate. We are at the top and look down over the campsite. The swimming pool is really nice. Nice and big with a very nice sunbathing area with lots of shade. Staff are super friendly! Sangria we tasty. For €19 (with ACSI card) I definitely recommend it"

16881,2893006,1,j23rm,26/06/2023,"There is hardly any shade, a lot of ants that sneak into the motorhome and everywhere, the floor is made of Chinese and sand and it gets very hot, the shower and the toilet smell a lot of being closed. We really paid for two days and when we were there we said to leave, they did not give us back a single euro."

16881,2872009,5,Mitsou,19/06/2023,very good campsite very pleasant swimming pool very friendly staff not far from Carceres by bike however I do not want to use the sink for the dishes and the shower which is private I prefer my campsite because the smell is not great and the kitchen sink deserves a good liter of bleach but when you can do otherwise ...... I give 5 stars
16881,2857587,4,jyel,15/06/2023,"consistent with the description. It's true that it's not easy to regulate the hot water correctly... And if you can't stand the promiscuity... personally I found that it was good, very calm, in this season in any case."
16881,2853991,1,annkk,14/06/2023,"Practical for visiting the place, but in mid-June, 30 degrees in the shade, swimming pool not open - only in ""summer"". That's unbelievable, especially since summer prices are charged (without any discount cards €28 for a small camper, two people)."
16881,2853378,5,hganhao,14/06/2023,"Complete and pleasant campsite. The particularity of having a private toilet is a pleasant surprise. Attentive and friendly staff. There are nights that can be calm, depending on the festive events on the football field next door, or the neighbor next door. But overall, I liked it. I plan to come back more often."
16881,2852355,4,giotilinewally,14/06/2023,a municepal campsite with such facilities .... never seen before. super.
16881,2844700,3,Tamlac,11/06/2023,"30 euros for one night, next to a ring road, so constant background noise, but it's more like a motorhome garage..., pitches on top of each other..."
16881,2818061,5,joke64,04/06/2023,"We spent 4 nights at the campsite. Wonderfully quiet, despite the fact that it is almost constantly full. Nice that you have your own toilet and shower, you can even get toilet paper at the reception. Cycling to the city is easy"

16881,2780157,4,alaohi,23/05/2023,"Quiet campsite. Very nice and attentive staff. The best detail that you have your own booth with shower, bathroom, sink and sink. It also has an awning that covers the entire motorhome giving it shade. We do not give it 5 stars because the shower did not have an intermediate point between hot and cold. Otherwise a fantastic experience."
16881,2772132,1,Petervbm,21/05/2023,"Well, everyone has their own taste. After an exploratory walk across this overwhelmingly filled camper depot, quickly drove on. To settle in such an aviary after a tour of 4000 km is a bit too much for us. We prefer what we can still call a campsite."
16881,2762614,3,AdriaOsel,19/05/2023,"All the advantages of the CP described so far, such as the private toilet building on the pitch and the furniture, are correct. However, these facilities are very old. Even the toilet brush, which had been mutilated over many years of use, was not replaced when asked because a larger order was said to be a long time coming."

16881,2683552,4,Appetute,20/04/2023,"Very nice campsite in the pine forest with lots of shade. The highlight: each pitch has its own sanitary building with toilet, sink and shower. There is also a fresh water connection outside and of course electricity. A table and two chairs are also part of each seat. You stand quite close together, but the space is still ok, a restaurant and a small shop are also available."

Having facilities on your pitch is a great idea, they give you a table and two chairs too. Resteraunt looked good and had a constant stream of people. We were charged €67 Inc electric and two dogs seemed very high to what we would normally pay. WiFi signal was great No shops nearby so think ahead."

16881,2632394,5,AnjasReisen,31/03/2023,"Very nice place with friendly staff and tidy pitches. The separate sanitary facilities for each pitch are an absolute highlight. However, the food in the restaurant can still be improved. All in all (with plumbing, shower and electricity) 19 euros paid."

Not as good as the one in France Port Grimaud but over half the price at 18€ per night wit ACSI and electric. Good shop, restaurant and pool would recommend"
16881,2385061,5,Robert276,19/09/2022,"Well laid out and maintained campsite. Have stayed here overnight. Despite the late arrival shortly before 9 am, the reception was still open and the receptionist was friendly and in a good mood. The own sanitary facilities were simple but very clean. The campsite is also well lit at night, which also means that you have to be able to darken the windows (no criticism, hinweiß). If the area offers something, we could also imagine spending a few days on this site."

the shop on site was poor, mainly drink and fresh daily bread, not too much else. there's a 1/2 hrly bus  to the old town (1.20 each way)."
16881,1859561,4,johng,29/04/2022,"Brilliant campsite, big spots, easy access in a 7.5m motorhome. Own shower and toilet on each pitch. Great to chill for a few days. Nice walk behind the campsite. Reasonably cycle (30 minutes) to the town. Downside of the site was the poor food in the restaurant."

They had a deal on - stay 4 nights for the piece of 3. The staff on site are so friendly and make you feel very welcome. On site bar is also nice to visit. We walked into Cáceres from the campsite which we’d recommend as the views are beautiful."

16881,1707811,5,AlanJulia,10/12/2021,"This site is really good and the photos of the toilet blocks don’t do it justice. They are very good, clean and hot water on tap. The staff go the extra mile to help. They helped us to find a clinic in the town centre so we could get our Covid Antigen test. The receptionist even phoned and gave them all our details as we don’t speak a word of Spanish. There’s fresh bread each day and a nice cafe on site all year round."

16881,1700266,4,maria41,29/11/2021,"Flat plots. If you read in the ACSI guide about the sauna, it closed 4 years ago. Very disappointing as we arrived on a very cold day. Facilities are good, our water was very hot but each plot has its own shower/toilet hut with each a gas heater so that may vary I suppose.  We had a peaceful night, did not hear any noise but it is low season. All in all worth a stop on the journey."

I would have liked to have used the pool, it closes at 7 p.m. Private sanitary facilities were great and clean! The scullery and laundry room were clean. 10.66 for a camper including 2 people and 2 dogs was a great price! Great for 1 night. The immediate area wasn't great."
16881,1623140,5,VinceVanVarden,02/10/2021,"Space under the roof is ideal for hot days; Plot with private sanitary facilities, electricity and water connection for the mobile home available. There are 2 washing machines and 1 dryer on the premises. Wash and dry laundry once for a total of € 6 is fine. Nice staff at the front desk. Music from the nearby disco doesn't bother us.

16881,1608257,5,JoseAlonsosales,25/09/2021,"From my point of view, the best campsite I have seen in all of Europe by far The fact of having a shower on each pitch seems amazing to me. It is true that you can listen to a bit of music in the distance on weekends, but come on, there are neighbors that sometimes bother you more. Facilities 10 impressive swimming pools, of course with people, like all campsites With changing rooms and children's playground."
16881,1590378,3,theonagtzaam,18/09/2021,Stayed here from Saturday to Sunday. Very noisy crowd at the campsite and there was a party going on both left and right of the campsite. All in all a restless evening and night. It should have been said at the reception. Price with Asci discount otherwise fine and the city itself is really worth it.
16881,1569560,4,lebourguignon,11/09/2021,"We have just spent 2 nights there (acsi price 18 €). Large stabilized pitches with private shower wc washbasin outside sink and elec water filling. Swimming pool restaurant, small grocery store. Really perfect for a Spanish campsite, moreover the bus to the city center is just outside the campsite ..... Small downside: not enough shade and I confirm the noisy nightclub WE next to the campsite."
16881,1551073,1,lequipageenvadrouille,05/09/2021,Sloping ground Sanitary to clean yourself with the means at hand Impossible to regulate the water to obtain a good temperature therefore very cold or very hot shower And finally the shower hose which breaks Even for 18th it is too expensive and no request for sanitary pass neither to enter nor for the swimming pool Really disappointed
16881,1528146,5,Aventurerosmarchosos,29/08/2021,"Fantastic campsite on a large plot, with shade, individual bathroom on the plot itself. Also swimming pool, cafeteria with menus. We will spend three days of rest and we will continue the route"
16881,1495891,2,C.Soriano,22/08/2021,"Despite having a very good pool, people from outside the campsite can enter and it is overcrowded. The reception and bar staff are rude. The pitches are very large and with their own bathroom, but there is hardly any shade. The baby swings in the scorching sun. Next to the campsite there is a stadium where the party area of the city has been set up, very loud music is heard most of the night."
16881,1481462,5,nerta13,19/08/2021,"We loved this campsite, € 31 (3 adults in a motorhome) for 4 nights, you pay 3, the great pool, the pitches are large and bathroom on each pitch, recommended, we will return. Thanks for everything."

We spent one night with a van, only € 26 which includes a large plot, electricity and a private bathroom on your plot with a hot shower. The bathroom also has a small sink outside to wash things. It has a pool and there can be a lot of people but to cool off for a while it's great. They allow pets.Highly recommended."
16881,1458243,2,brianfrancis,15/08/2021,"It is a comfortable campsite because it has individual toilets and showers on each pitch, and the pool is very nice. However, it is located in an industrial estate far from the city, the swimming pool is open to the public and is crowded on weekends, and the pitches lack shade. In addition, it is attached to a football stadium where they organize macro discos every summer weekend."

A spectacular swimming pool, with public access, of course, so that in the afternoons it fills up to the brim and beware of the just ones. Instead you can enjoy it almost for yourself. To return without a doubt."

The floor is cement well delimited with the possibility of receiving 8 motorhomes and not 12 because of the trees preventing it. this area is at the end of the street so probably quiet because no traffic. cheer.

The entire parking lot has a slight incline, we did not have chocks and in the plots on the left we have slept perfectly. Free filling and emptying service.

In the spring it must be very beautiful with a view of the Mancha mills. Slightly sloping terrain and no light. The City Council is always grateful for these initiatives."
16936,2533115,3,jcastellp,29/12/2022,Slightly uneven ground. When we try to put wedges they slip on the very smooth cement floor. We are not the only ones who experience this. The gray and black dump site can be mistaken for a parking space. It's at the end on the left. Located five minutes walk from the center. Very good for spending the night. Thanks to the City Council for this service.

16936,2514552,2,Franquilo,06/12/2022,"Despite the fact that there are 12 parking spaces, it feels too small. We were three Ac's and it was difficult to maneuver. The trees have very low branches and rub against your vehicle, and they are also placed in the middle, so they take up a lot of space. Still and all the services work correctly. Many thanks to Puerto Lápice for this place."

Very quiet area away from traffic, quiet. You can walk through the town, with a nearby bar to have a drink.

16936,2462685,4,catherinesfinch,26/10/2022,Perfect new site. All automated and things didn’t work! Issues reading debit cards to enter. Finally credit card worked. Services all paid fir separately which was confusing. On leaving a van couldn’t exit as barrier wouldn’t open. Paid ticket for bathroom access didn’t work. Help telephone number unobtainable. Shame as a pristine area. One price for all services would be better.

We left and went to the other parking area at the other end of the village which was much better even though it was not free. But worth the small cost."

A woman saw the problem we were having and offered to hook the hose to her house. How nice to meet people like that on the road. The squares have a bit of an incline. Very good for the town hall of Puerto Lapice."
16936,1528602,4,linchu,29/08/2021,"Quiet place, still without shadows, but a good place to stop while traveling. As a suggestion, they should put a separate water intake from the one for emptying the sewage. Otherwise, all good. Another town hall to thank for thinking of us."

16991,411216,3,mondeno,01/12/2018,December 1 completely alone. We have stayed overnight and the local police has passed without any problem. Very close to the beach. beach near town for my taste without charm for that reason. the one that looks for a chiringuito and a great restaurant.
16991,398522,5,Papypat,24/10/2018,"Given the lack of choice in the region I put 5 stars, the policia passed without comment. Nice walk on the beach ..."
16991,175204,1,carlosutrera,15/08/2017,You can not stay overnight! The police only fine for parking during the night. I think they are called neighbors or the beach bar!
16991,128130,2,refacheiro,16/04/2017,"Site well located, close to the beach, but very careful with the robberies, we stayed two days and went to steal at noon to a motorhome that was parked next to us. Apparently it is very common as the neighbors comment."
16991,103073,5,ellale,05/09/2016,Good place to spend the night ... No shadow ... Bars and supermarkets nearby .. Between 5 and 10 acs and average camper ... In case you want company ...
17047,2217670,4,Baer1953,11/08/2022,"Very nice place to reach town with a nice walk. The Cupacopana of Spain very beautiful. Nice staff in the repression speak many languages, including German, we really liked the square, large squares, everything was clean. The only drawback was that there weren't many water connections, you always had to walk a long way to get water."
17047,1637265,5,Lana2104,10/10/2021,"Best campsite in Benidorm hands down. Friendly staff, clean and good facilities.Big swimming pools.Restaurant and bar. Very cheap prices.Happy hours everyday €1 for pint. every night an entertainment. No dogs and cats.Only downside absolutely no shade at all.We only stayed by pool to stay cool.If you got aircon this is good.Per night €28 for 2 people, VW campsite and electricity."
17047,1372778,4,mireianavarro26,27/07/2021,Correct size plot but the awning was down and in poor condition. Awesome and large pool. Well-kept campsite in every way and very quiet. Correct animation. Great sinks with lots of toilets and showers.
17047,20326,2,robinsonpascal,31/07/2014,"Here we speak only English and Spanish, so if you only understand French you will be ""alone in the world ......"". The on-site market is ok no more, and apart from the pool and sun no other things to do .... the center is quite a walk but hey it's a walk, there are plenty of restaurants, shops , and Market. In town also English is de rigueur, at the price level (in town) it's ok too. I came to this campsite for the first time but good for services and quality compared to the price I will not come back, I have already seen better and cheaper, so you see ....."
17103,3080878,4,Api444,05/08/2023,"Very useful in this region where there are not many service areas. Accessible with a 3m motorhome to empty black water and fill water. Attention discharge for them = gray water and black water. If you empty gray water without telling them, they will charge you 2€."
17103,2803038,2,patmar30,30/05/2023,No desire to park here. Parking without interest for a DC greater than 2.20m. The services are chargeable.

17103,2153240,5,GuilhermeDuarte,31/07/2022,"Great! I spent two nights. I parked next to the car wash, which is open 24 hours a day, but it didn't bother me. Wi-Fi at Intermarchè (during opening hours) and Bar Republika. WC and laundry. Payable water services. 3 km historic center of Elvas. I recommend!"
17103,2102473,3,eider91,21/07/2022,"good place to take a short break, shop and continue the trip. It's a shame that they now charge €3.5 for filling and emptying the water."
17103,2085508,3,criistiina,17/07/2022,"It is not a free area, you have to pay 2 euros to empty it, which is quite good, and 3.5 to fill it with water, it depends on the intermarché,"
17103,2066613,4,F.Miranda,13/07/2022,"Free waters, and we pour the two waters also free. We filled up with diesel as fuel was cheaper here than in Spain. The only problem is that the water supply was on our right side and the street has only one direction, this place requires gymnastics. Good stop! Thank you Intermarche."

At the weekend, drunk youngsters are screaming on the square until 4am!"
17103,1587503,3,DavMac,17/09/2021,"During the day we had no problem pouring gray water and cassette and filling water. We tried now (it's 22:30), with Intermarché closed and it wasn't possible: the taps are closed. Access is good but I recommend being careful with the awnings and the corners of the shading."

17123,2581066,4,sougmi,17/02/2023,Nice well maintained campsite. Good welcome. Clean toilets. Pitches are small enough for large CC's. Trees with fairly low branches make maneuvering tedious. Very close to the small town of Cambrils (15 min. walk). ACSI card accepted.

You can keep your camper nice and clean as they offer you the possibility to wash it. Beautiful old town as well as long beach promenad with good restaurants and coffee shops. Market day Wednesday in the old town. Yes a very good experience and grateful we where recommended to go to Cambrils - we will be back.
17123,2416257,1,joanjo,01/10/2022,"You must book a minimum of two nights. I can understand that, but we called to ask about availability and when we explained that we only wanted one night, we were told that there was a free plot. When we arrived we were told that there was only one, but when we went to see it it was occupied!! They made us come for nothing. Poor organization..."

After he went in to inquire, it turned out that there was an additional €18 per person, so a total of €87/night. Nice try but not with us… found honest people further on! stay away from here!!!"
17123,1976198,5,sunny787,14/06/2022,"We felt very comfortable. Our 4.5 year old loved the water playground and entertainment (mini disco and face painting) on the weekend. The pitches are tight, but our mobile (7.5m including the bikes on the back) fit on it. The dusty sandy soil creates a lot of dirt, maybe bring a large tarp to put it on! There are stinging jellyfish in the sea: be careful! We'd love to come back"
17123,1953072,5,Wirly,06/06/2022,"Great campsite, very clean and reasonably priced. Great pool and very close to the beach. Beach for dogs not very far but poorly maintained. Perfect for a bike ride along the sea."
17123,1789125,5,FrancescMR,20/03/2022,"Camping with high quality facilities and services. Restrooms very well maintained and clean. Restaurant with very attentive and friendly staff. Price and quality hand in hand, we will certainly repeat. I travel by motorhome and I greatly appreciate those Campings that are updated and offer us first-class services, and this is one of them. I recommend it 100x100."
17123,1779783,1,c.Stephan73,11/03/2022,"No hot water in the showers, not great after a mountain bike ride. The attitude of the staff unacceptable, not even an apology. To avoid."

17123,1747134,4,brice34,04/02/2022,"Great campsite with all options. Everything is new, heated sanitary facilities. We are camping because there are a lot of trees to get into the pitches you have to maneuver a little. On the other hand, the campsite is stuck to the beach with one of the most beautiful seafronts we have seen! No car the top"

17123,1728456,4,emcKA,07/01/2022,"A very nice campground near to the city center (about 2 Km) and beaches. I was there in January. It‘s a little far north for a long stay in winter, but good for a day or two before heading further south. I‘m sure it‘s a nice place in the summer for a longer stay."
17123,1726238,4,BrigitteMorgenstern,04/01/2022,"Great sanitary facilities, small parking spaces otherwise clean and tidy. But I also find € 28.52 a high price in the off-season"

17123,1626024,3,hapewick,04/10/2021,"Almost every day the tractors drive on the left side of the campsite to transport rubbish bins, sometimes as early as 9 a.m. in the morning. This is not always very pleasant, and the clearance height of the main paths is not always optimal because the trees are not cut regularly."
17123,1362795,2,wynns2,25/07/2021,"In normal times, nice camping, 10 minutes from Cambrils and ""quick"" access to the beach. We have found that with the Covid issue there is a lot of lack of control, exorbitant crowds in camping areas, swimming pools, ... no control for wearing a mask in common areas."
17123,1340832,4,Remolin,19/07/2021,"Well located campsite to visit Cambrils on foot, the squares are somewhat suitable for motorhomes and with very low branches that can be hit by the vehicle. It has all the services and very close to the beach"

17123,1193585,4,MaligaTourBelgique,12/05/2021,"Small campsite at the top (not directly by the sea but very close). Super friendly staff, very clean and modern toilets. Quiet campsite very close to the city center! To recommend!"
17123,1185483,5,Rasjahcor,04/05/2021,Whenever we go down to Cambrils we come to this campsite. The owners are super friendly (that alone is worth it) and the pitches are spacious. Near the center by the promenade and near the beach.
17123,1170597,3,Solitario,09/04/2021,Campsite with many seasonal pitches with noisy users. Out of season and with an ACSI card it is viable. Attention to the low trees for the AC's.
17123,1170014,1,weyhercamper,07/04/2021,Arrived today and wanted to stay a week. Unfortunately we found that the showers had no warm or hot water. A request at the reception did not give any result. We'll continue like this tomorrow. Too bad.

17123,931500,4,AntoniJS,05/08/2020,"Camping with all the services for motorhomes, the disadvantage is that the plots only have light. To have water you have to go to the place where you can empty the gray water at the entrance. Be careful with the trees, they are a bit low for the motorhome."
17123,897671,3,jgonsam,25/07/2020,"The children's pool is very nice and you can be calm because the water barely reaches the waist of a 3 year old. The super very basic. The bathrooms, although the cleaners are there all day, are always dirty, there is very little information about the few activities that there are, at night the only thing you can do is go to the Cambrils promenade, inside the campsite nothing. Plots you can be lucky enough to be assigned a very large or a very small one, being the same type of plot, I was lucky. The good price, € 45 night motorhome, electricity, and a child"

17123,703396,1,fafa68brulez,24/09/2019,"Very nice and shady campsite. On the other hand, the management is very negligent and does not take into account the requests made during the reservation, 3 months in advance and for the month of September. She favors the Spaniards. All our requests have remained veins. In addition, the campsite is very noisy at weekends."
17123,549758,5,lukes,12/07/2019,"Large, clean campsite. Plots from small to large. Sanitary facilities clean - cleaning staff twice a day. A well-stocked supermarket.

We recommend."

The plots are a little bit right for our motorhome of 7 m but at this season it is not very serious. The staff speaks French, very nice, the campsite has completely redone the pool area with a small waterslide fun for children, the playground was also redone. The grocery store is very good with good bread, the paella of the restaurant is very good. There is the beach next door (1 street to cross), the port with its many restaurants 10 minutes along the beach on foot, or 5 minutes by bicycle bike path. The market on Wednesday about 15 minutes walk (all flat, no coast so it's a nice ride). Clean campsite, very nice calm. There are 2 old sanitary a little old but clean or 1 large sanitary recent with hot water and very clean. We will come back with pleasure for the welcome, the price and the ideal location to walk in Cambrils or go to Salou by the bike path."

The bathrooms of the dirty camping, small plots for motorhomes, the zone of swings gives fear (better not to approach), the light went and came continuously.

Sufficient plots to put chairs and table 500 m from the city center the part near the beach (which is 300 m) must be protected from the noise of trains .. Attention in a few aisles low branches ..
17123,108824,1,chanpou,05/10/2016,"Camping with small pitches Risk of damaging the campers because the branches are low and huge. In addition, bad organization at the reception. We were asked to change places that evening, when we were placed in the morning. Our plot was reserved the next day. So we left. I do not recommend."
17123,67719,1,cloclo64,07/04/2016,"I come back on my comment, if camping in winter was very nice, I must say that we spent a night on Passover and that the reception was more than limit.

The situation is pleasant. 25€ for the night (a little expensive for a CC area) and at the weekend, the reception advised us to take an uber rather than public transport to reach Porto. The price gives access to the biological park."

So play it since they don't give you an option. The camper very well but the reception staff very bad. The last time I was there there was a super affable and attentive person, this time I am very disappointed. I'm leaving without finishing seeing Portugal."

To many animals in a cage in a poor habitat and the information is only in Portuguese. Something worth nothing is that you can’t really leave the property after 22:00. They close the gate and if you want to go out you need to phone the security and they’ll let you out.

In our opinion, space is too expensive for a visit to Porto (virtually no time at the space). with Uber to the center between 7 and 14 euros (rush hour). The reception does not recommend taking a bus (5 changes). Unfortunately, the front desk was extremely unfriendly. no drinking water. the wildlife park is beautiful (best to visit after checking out (until noon!))"

If it is true that it has only one tap, but if you use it carefully there is no problem. Our intention was to leave the car in a safe place. An uber does not cost you more than 10 euros. It compensates the 19 euros that you get for spending the night, light, emptying and filling. Staff of 10. We understood each other in Spanish. Recommended 100%"

It is in the middle of the town and bad luck we coincided with the Quitos so in the middle of the night young people began to arrive with loudspeakers and it became impossible to sleep. It only has 3 parking spaces where you can park for an electrical outlet, the rest are all for cars. Bad experience so we had to leave."

17216,2496161,5,mercelz,15/11/2022,"Very good area! We parked without problems in the rest of the spaces. I would improve the clean water faucet, it is easy to get wet, it gives a lot of pressure. Good internet coverage. It has a gym in the nearby street, a free bike repair station nearby. Electricity is much cheaper in Elciego: 12 hours for two euros. Highly recommend the Thanksgiving holidays."

The idea is very good but in high season it is very fair"

I have also been observing that many people pee outside their vans, motorhome, etc ... (even having potis) and leave little pieces of paper next to their urination or droppings .. if you use a piece of paper, take it back with you. I observed the same thing on the way to Toloño"

17248,2425579,4,Eltorado,05/10/2022,"Free area with all services. There are 5 spaces for mobile homes, but there is also a large parking lot where you can park. Flat and quiet at night. There is also shaded parking. Center and shops nearby."

17248,2290613,4,pineda_vikingo,23/08/2022,"Caravan parking for 6 places. It is normally empty. It is a parking lot with constant movement of cars and the national police also pass by from time to time. It's fine for sleeping, level and quiet. With a playground right next door and supermarkets nearby."
17248,2143779,1,quijote,30/07/2022,"Not recommended for sleeping. Dirt and dust everywhere. Two garbage collections with trucks during the night, one at 5 am and the other at 7 am. It only serves to discharge gray and black water and load clean water."
17248,2112964,4,SaraCrespo,23/07/2022,we spent one night here. good services and level seats. I recommend arriving in the afternoon-night to be able to take one of the places for motorhomes. there is a bit of noise but you can sleep well.
17248,2082718,4,frillo,16/07/2022,"Very good access to ac and parking. I did not see accessible toilets. Water and emptying without problem. On July 15, nearby music from the Carmen festivities until dawn"
17248,2047400,4,fbrunner,07/07/2022,We spent two very peaceful nights here. Great location and services working perfectly. A warning: the trees provide shade but dove poop also falls in abundance (a pity).
17248,2042233,3,Caravanadominguera,06/07/2022,"Pros: Location, close to the entire shopping area, charming Paseo de las Cortes de Aragon, in front of the roundabout, where there is a boulevard covered by the shade of some huge trees, full of tables where you can have a drink or the park of La Serna on the other side of the area, ideal for cycling, children and pets. Cons: Birds in abundance and pigeons. Pineapples fall, it is what it is."
17248,1993969,4,Paichi,20/06/2022,"Area with filling/emptying service. There are about 6 places limited in a macro-parking. It has a shadow. Having the containers next to us, the smell was not very pleasant, so we preferred to park in the common spaces that were almost all empty and perfect. Mercadona is next door and you can go with AC. Remember to ask for La Dolores! and visit the oldest pastry shop in Spain"
17248,1972175,4,Kaiser10,13/06/2022,"Area with gray and black filling and emptying services, we were very hot, in the last parking spaces there are shadows, in the first ones there are not, very accessible to the town, right next to the center, the old part of the town a bit deserted, a pity since it has some beautiful churches, it does not have electricity service, a quiet place to spend the night."

17248,1946274,4,icthus,04/06/2022,"Great for visiting the city which is rich in its historical heritage. In particular, an old Sephardic Jewish quarter of which only the mayor's synagogue remains. We enjoyed the stay in this town of Calatayud very much. Thank you to the municipality for making this perfect place available"
17248,1923537,3,rachelcys,28/05/2022,"Nice to have an air in the middle of town with water available and pine trees for shade. But on the other hand, we only spent one night there and that's enough because it's quite noisy with cars drifting at night, it's the shortcut for scooters in the neighborhood and we wouldn't have felt reassured there if we were alone in the parking lot."
17248,1897337,5,MaiteMonet,18/05/2022,"super good, in the center of the city trees that give a perfect shade to be cool and very comfortable and quiet. No noise at night."

I don't give it a 5 because it doesn't have gray water emptying or filling, but the ares is great! It is next to a road that has no traffic at night. The area is fenced so the dog could be at his free will! Congratulations Town Hall of Brea!"

17248,1708971,3,vivirnoescaro,12/12/2021,"It is a parking with services. Nothing special, but correct. We have slept here a lot of times since it always catches us in passing and always well. Sometimes there are kids because in front of the area there are benches and they get there to drink, but you park at the beginning of the parking lot and they no longer bother you. Tonight, despite being Saturday, we slept luxuriously"
17248,1707794,1,Tomad,10/12/2021,"Lots of noise, drums playing and people making a bottle, you can't sleep all night. one bite."
17248,1706723,4,beloncete,08/12/2021,"Correct area, with 8 reserved spaces next to the water loading and unloading area, although as it is part of the fairground car park, more spaces are available. The entrance is on a roundabout, it is easy to pass it, but you can enter later. The tap to load water has a push button and a large, complicated thread."
17248,1705900,4,Remolin,07/12/2021,Quiet area where you can spend the night and visit the city since it is next to the city center. It has all the services except electricity

17248,1694504,1,alberto40,21/11/2021,We got there and there was a circus set up and we had to go to the other one. they could signal it. The one with a large motorhome will have trouble turning around

17248,1634602,4,BNCToni,09/10/2021,"Thanks to the city administration for this free space. Some would say: Nothing special. Womo drivers say: in the middle of the city, VE, free of charge, quiet - what more could you want"
17248,1634577,4,CMSBejar,09/10/2021,"We were a little worried about whether there was no room since we were arriving very late and on Friday, but great! there were several caravans and cars, but plenty of room! a very quiet night! next to it there is a cornfield and there is a bike path. We write it down for another time :)"
17248,1633219,4,padraigl,08/10/2021,"Have stayed here many times. 

There are restaurants and cafe/bars close-by. We had a lovely menu del dia in Bar Restaurante Paco for €11.50 each.

The free service area has no signage but we have used it with no issues and we drink from our onboard fresh tank.

Cheap diesel €1.18 in BonArea station on the road in."

17248,1556084,1,Learsi,07/09/2021,"Very dirty area, you can tell that no one cleans it, many flies, wasps, children's playground dirty by bottle, we have entered several caravans and as we entered, we all left due to insecurity and hygiene."
17248,1531115,4,DaniAw,30/08/2021,"Very central. It has all the services. There is a playground but quite dirty. We spent one night, you could hear the noise of kids but it was manageable. The noise of the birds was worse."
17248,1522444,3,dekapax,28/08/2021,"In a very large parking lot, surrounded by buildings and with bottled kids, at the back where it is hotter, there are the few places in the area. the coaches occupy a place along the parking lot looking for some freshness and fleeing from the smell of the cubes, but if you go near the park you suffer from nighttime joking even so thanks to the municipality for this area and the benefits"
17248,1517299,1,Marimaar19,26/08/2021,"Impossible to sleep, we have arrived and there was a fair, the birds singing like crazy, children screaming, the garbage smelled very bad, dirty and left. We have not found any public toilet. A shame, because you are touching the center of town ..."

17248,1472291,4,Furgocatt,17/08/2021,"We had a good night, although being the weekend there was some fuss with the kids partying. Being a parking lot there is quite a hole and a lot of shade. There are toilets but they are abandoned, they cannot be used. For a passing night, fine. Right next to it is a hiking trail."
17248,1450535,4,MireiaCodina,13/08/2021,Great for filling and emptying waters
17248,1432543,4,dekapax,10/08/2021,"The motorhome area is small, it is very good because it has trees and water and since it is a very large parking lot they allow parking and spending the night in the rest of the places the problem is that it is the area for young people and it is hot because the parking is sandwiched between built-up area"
17248,1425016,4,joaquinlasierra,08/08/2021,Area for 6 or 7 motorhomes. It is in the center and very close to the municipal police. Ideal to visit the town. Loading and unloading of water without electricity. 2/3 squares shaded by pine trees. Thanks to the Calatayud city council !!

17248,1409100,2,JJunior,05/08/2021,"Suitable area for both installation and parking area. The bad thing about the people who get together at night making a ruckus until the late hours. And also some ""companions"" doing camping taking out chairs and tables !!!"
17248,1403955,3,monicafp,04/08/2021,"Excellent area! very large, next to parks and an area for walking or cycling ... The but ... The cars of young people who gather there to meet up ... Much noise until they finally leave ... Jmac"

17248,1292789,4,KemaoB,03/07/2021,"Good shady free area, toilets, a short walk from the center and next to the local police, who pass by often. The weak points are that there are few places, the tap is push-button (it's a pain to fill with those taps), and the toilets that are there are so dirty that they are actually unusable. But overall very well, thank you very much to the city for hosting us!"
17248,1271393,4,letscambium,22/06/2021,"Free place next to the center, shady squares and playground for children. Free services. Too bad the toilets there are made a pigsty. It is recommended to park in the last places to avoid the sound of passing vehicles."
17248,1259166,1,ALX667,16/06/2021,"The parking spaces are between residential buildings and a large parking lot. Cars drive through all the time - it's a shortcut, apparently. Shadows only in the evening. The place has had its prime. Young people meet with their junk trucks and pee everywhere. I wouldn't refill water here either. Unfortunately arrived too late otherwise we would have continued"
17248,1236171,5,Pardiko,04/06/2021,"Well, with shade, and all the services, but be careful to enter, it is in the same roundabout and the area is between buildings, sheltered from air and noise, nearby Mercadona and the old town nearby, with a lot of history"

17248,1149063,4,Cucaramalla,08/03/2021,"Parkin next to local police. It has a marked area separated from the rest for the neighbors. The filling tap is push-button and you have to keep pressing all the time, it is a bit uncomfortable. The rest all ok."

17248,995167,3,moli82,23/08/2020,"Good parking area, the police are passing to control since there is also a parking lot and from what I have read sometimes there are children messing it up, we were calm"
17248,991043,2,Javito120,22/08/2020,Perfect area. But I subscribe to the previous comment. Kids wanting to tease. They seem to enjoy it. I don't think we'll be back here much.

17248,870046,3,Rubiocks74,15/07/2020,"A very well located area, we walked around the town and it has an exaggerated neglect. We only stayed one night and slept well next to another car. sometimes cars pass by and do some skidding, I imagine to annoy"
17248,843365,5,Rubiocks74,01/07/2020,"We have been tonight and everything is perfect, bars, shops, supermarket, everything close by and the quiet area."
17248,837428,3,bouyoco,26/06/2020,"The area itself is great and the effort of the town hall is appreciated. The reason for putting 3 stars is due to the neglect and poor appearance of the historic center. There are streets that are painful as they are, the maintenance of monumental buildings ... a shame the truth."

17248,790512,5,rponce,03/03/2020,Area with few spaces although there is a large parking lot next to where to park. It is very close to the center and the tourist office. Good for filling and emptying. Thanks to Calatayud for having this motorhome area.
17248,782921,4,15plus3,19/02/2020,"We were here today for emptying and filling. The other comments are correct, the planning of the service station could be better. Attention: Fresh water connection is 1/2 "", not the usual 3/4"" of a normal tap. we have 3/4 ""and 1"" connections. In the next hardware store we are still looking for a 1/2 ""adapter for these cases. We drove on without being able to fill the water tank."
17248,747367,4,padraigl,26/11/2019,"This is a large flat tarmac carpark with free services behind high residential apartments off the main street. The 7 dedicated parking spaces for motorhomes are under the trees close to the apartments which is not great if you need solar power. 

Pros:
Free parking.
Free full services excluding electricity.
Local supermarket, restaurant, cafes and bars. 
Shade.

Cons:
Trees block solar especially in winter months.

There are full free services excluding electricity. 

The grey drain has some flow direction into the grate.

The black WC drain is at ground level beside the grey drain grate and has no cover or signage. The drain pipe is large with no splashback. The cassette push button tap is at very low level on the pillar and has very good pressure. Wouldn't be surprised if the fresh water tap is used to clean cassettes.

The fresh water push button tap is a medium screw-on connection with excellent pressure. The button has to be held in for water to flow.

There are large bins in the carpark.

There are restaurants and cafe/bars close-by. There is a lovely park on the far side of the river just over the wooden bridge. Mercadona is 5 minutes walk up the main street. Alcampo is 15 minutes walk on the edge of town. They have a gas station that can be good value for diesel sometimes. There is a Repsol garage on the A2 that has LPG but we were refused by the guy when we tried to fill up.

We had 1 very quiet night here with 5 other motorhomes. We actually parked at the end of the carpark so we would get the sun on the solar panels first thing in the morning. The first 2 motorhome parking spaces get the sun in the mornings but the rest don't. One motorhome who parked under the trees realised in the morning there was no sun and moved beside us.

Bugs/Mosquitoes. (They love us..)
We did not encounter any mosquitoes here in the end of November but there was plenty of annoying small flies."

17249,3176557,5,levichi,18/08/2023,"Camping with good facilities: beautiful pool and perfect bathrooms. We value it very much. Typical coastal campsite with plots of land. Lack of shade, yes. The large plots. The price in August is 55 euros per night for a van, two adults, a child and a dog. Activities for children and adults. The right employees. You can tell that it is run with love."
17249,2929681,3,Sandra7532,06/07/2023,"we came a few years ago, it was a very nice little campsite and there when we arrived, big surprise it became a paradise campsite, suddenly, we did not cross the reception, too much change and became too big"
17249,2834240,5,annahendo,08/06/2023,"Great campsite - seems very new with amazing pool. Restaurant and shop are only open on weekends when we were there so was closed for us. Easy walk to lovely little historic town, although at 7.30pm nowhere served food, only drinks. Best to have food with you to prepare on site. Nice plots with a far off view to the sea"

17249,1700944,4,midel62,30/11/2021,Surprised by previous reviews. Camping in the middle of nature. Still under construction. Friendly staff. A few locations for the XXL ones.
17249,1563797,1,gon943,10/09/2021,"I do not advise it. Watch out!! almost nil covid prevention measures. Dirty and broken bathrooms. It is in the ACSI guide which I have stopped buying because they lie when they say that the OVERNIGHT in a motorhome is prohibited outside the CAMPINGs. CAMPING should be an option, never an obligation. You just need to want to put the trailers so that the truckers can spend the night."
17249,1531686,1,Suricatobike,30/08/2021,"The worst of all the campsites we visited, they do not explain anything to you when you arrive, the owner breaks Spanish and is not able to explain herself, the anticovid measures do not exist and the slowest check-in in history, I do not recommend it at all, for something it is the only one we found with room to spare."
17249,1399694,2,Floetenjulia,03/08/2021,"Campsite with a lot of potential in beautiful, rural surroundings. Unfortunately, it was still not a relaxing stay: too few toilets, 2 of them defective, no toilet paper, no soap, too few showers, machine noise in the middle of the night. And that for the price of 32 € !! Not again!"
17249,1156464,5,sensecap,23/03/2021,"Wonderful, perfect camping to spend a few or many days. They are within ACSI so you can save a few euros. Many quiet pitches and cabins, all with electricity and water, swimming pool with slides, children's play area, bathrooms, showers and laundry area. and peace, much peace. They are expanding hectares for what it promises even more."
17249,531773,5,Thaiclo,28/06/2019,"Very nice campsite..belle swimming pool, sanitary and very clean services. The reception is very warm. It is quietly located in the olive trees. Very reasonable prices, but it takes a means of locomotion because the first city is 8km Work in progress the camping will triple volume ... See you next year"

17249,280459,5,STX28,04/07/2018,Camping really welcoming and very nice. new owners very smiling with plenty of planning and expansion projects. welcome for CCPL more than 10m with 220 in 6 or 10 amp. Nice pool and small friendly restaurant. Recommend without hesitation if you want to avoid the crowd of Peniscola.
17249,244130,5,flomarbou,01/05/2018,"Blow of heart for this campsite, calm, cleanliness, well maintained, perfect. Home top in French and more, value for money nothing to say. I highly recommend."

17249,227780,5,milou34,15/03/2018,"A beautiful campsite, very quiet, large plot. In the middle of olive trees and orange trees conducive to very beautiful walks that I made with my dog. Beautiful village not far away with all the shops. The sea is less than 10 km. Change of ownership, the new ones are as friendly and warm as the previous ones and they too are French."
17249,199965,4,toccata,03/10/2017,"Perfect ! it's beautiful, the sites are large and shaded and the privacy of each is respected. Beautiful swimming pool and remarkable flowering plants. Bottom: sanitary type ""cloakroom"" are of minimum comfort in our time, but always clean. International atmosphere. For typical atmosphere, go to the village. Organic vegetables at L'Hortet D'Ana. Excellent pastry Virgen Del Socorro."

17265,3247701,3,Rulmann,01/09/2023,"It's not a big deal, but it does its job (empty gray water, clean the toilet and fill water). The tap to clean the toilet is the same as the one to fill water. I find it unhygienic. In its favor: that there are no other service points nearby."
17265,3121879,3,sprinter6,11/08/2023,"Area for 9 seats, near the beach, an Eroski and a bike lane next to the area. The downside is that there are people (I spoke with them) who had been there for more than 1 week and I think that everyone should have the opportunity to enjoy the places."
17265,3074173,4,theibid,04/08/2023,"We have spent a very quiet night together with five other motorhomes. We called the town hall and they told us that we could stay overnight without problems. It is true that the services only have one tap for everything. The beach behind the school is highly recommended, and eating at the Bardancas Tavern, 4 minutes from the area. Seafood tavern with a good atmosphere and the best seafood."
17265,3051064,3,GloriaPuerto,31/07/2023,"Good for emptying grays and blacks, it is what it is anyway. thanks darling"
17265,3035461,4,Antoniozafra,28/07/2023,"Quiet place at the entrance of the town, next to a school zone with a green area, access to the beach in 100 meters, a good place to carry water and sleep. water tap without threaded outlet. thanks to love for this place for us."
17265,3002348,1,EIV,22/07/2023,"quiet area, place for 4 or 5 motorhomes. and a single faucet to clean the chemical and get clean water, not very hygienic really. With how easy it is to install 2 independent taps."
17265,2908751,3,jtoldra,30/06/2023,Good to empty but it is only a tap to fill and we have had to fill jugs
17265,2859618,4,phiphi_5,16/06/2023,Well-appointed service no screws at the tap small parking lot next to the kindergarten
17265,2823934,1,yoli1811,05/06/2023,"It's a shame... I don't understand how they can consider a fountain with a push-button a place to fill water... I'm not going to drink, I'm going to refill... It's impossible to adapt it and make it stay fixed unless you hold it continuously, because it's not talk about the water pressure ... not to return"
17265,2672110,5,HPM1961,15/04/2023,"Awesome, thanks to the community!!"
17265,2615358,3,Kurt-Suender,19/03/2023,"Very small and the fresh water comes from a faucet that is used very after the toilet. A lot of people will flush their toilets. Better than nothing but if you don't have to, you should fill up your water somewhere else. Emptying the toilet is also quite impractical because the drain is so deep that it splashes."
17265,2429554,5,Sim38,07/10/2022,"Super: everything is functional, clean, free and very quiet in this period."
17265,2337844,4,jairo,04/09/2022,"Emptying and filling in good condition and cleanliness. Good ubication. Quiet Saturday night. It is next to a school, so I think it should be avoided during school hours. Thanks to the council for this free service."
17265,2273858,2,Maria1127,20/08/2022,"emptied and filled. Nothing more, although it is appreciated. Regarding the comment regarding the Nordeste restaurant, indicate that it is a seedy bar. Not worth it"
17265,2249181,3,MC4333,16/08/2022,"The faucet is not threaded, but adapters are sold at the town hardware store. When buying it, I got the impression that they have sold a few. In one of the linear car parks on the promenade they do not allow vehicles longer than 5 meters to park, but they do on the other sidewalk."
17265,2185871,4,marialed81,06/08/2022,"We slept there one night because we couldn't find a place on the seafront street. Very quiet place, the only downside is that we could not refill water because the tap had a very small nozzle and we did not have a suitable adapter. Otherwise great."
17265,2181833,4,tdm77,05/08/2022,It's not big ok but you can walk to town and it's free. The most will eat at Nordeste a restaurant located a few minutes walk behind. Super cheap and very warm welcome to do again without hesitation.
17265,2152701,4,elbasto,31/07/2022,"Everything worked out great, although a few more parking spaces wouldn't hurt but okay. City is cute and worth seeing, but one evening is enough."
17265,2112892,5,Paichi,23/07/2022,"The area is not large, there are at most 10 vehicles. What is not very logical is to have a berlingo or similar and get in there when the town restricts access to ACs through certain streets. Let's be a little roommates with those of us who have GV/AC It's close to the boardwalk, there are shops, restaurants, and several trails with great views. We made one through nature to Cabo Ortegal"
17265,2085146,3,fucis,17/07/2022,"Despite the fact that it is not very appealing from the outset because of the area in which it is located, we spent a very quiet night. It turns out that just behind what looks like a school there is a beach... not very big but nice for a walk."
17265,1981170,2,zofe,16/06/2022,"Less bad than I'd feared. While the storm raged up on the mountains and the wind whisked the clouds at the lighthouse, I could let the storm pass here. Relatively quiet at night, when sports hall's operations end. Here you stand reasonably sheltered and level. Admittedly without any charm, but practical indeed."
17265,1977088,1,EwaMyszka,14/06/2022,"Fully parked with cars so you have to wait until they move. Water dirty when you fill the bottle, we didn't use it. Gray water and toilet only."
17265,1958716,1,angelbcn,08/06/2022,The area is full of cars that make it impossible to use. At least that's what happens when you arrive at school time.

17265,1913188,4,jonaskesh,24/05/2022,"Good place to load and empty water, we did not sleep but it seems quiet."
17265,1866454,4,Lunatica66,02/05/2022,"Thanks to the municipality of Cariño for remembering the motorhome drivers, all free services. Negative observation is attached to a school and gray water hits the school fence."
17265,1856840,4,peterpp,27/04/2022,"All right, there are still the companion's flanges to help us keep the faucet coming out. The only drawback is that there is only one tap for cleaning and poti."
17265,1808125,5,elgriegonet,06/04/2022,It has all the basics needed to empty and fill water. Many thanks to the municipality. Full 4G (Orange)
17265,1741004,3,Rasjahcor,25/01/2022,"Thanks to the town hall for having these services. However, the tap is push-button and with little pressure apart from being the same to fill and to clean the potty. The site does not invite you to stay in addition to being full of cars that prevent parking."
17265,1660332,4,KePaXeta,24/10/2021,"Free emptying and filling area. The tap is push-button, with the help of a flange everything is much easier, we have left it on the tap, surely the next one will do well"
17265,1625441,4,AnaMnv,04/10/2021,"Good area for emptying gray and black water and filling with water, but I did not see it well to spend the night."
17265,1613391,3,euproctus,27/09/2021,"Small and with services (tap without thread ...), flat and close to the center of town, shops (supermarket) 1 minute walk"
17265,1563497,3,noranahiN,09/09/2021,"Thanks to the town hall of Cariño for the effort made in starting up the area, that you think of us is appreciated. Being in front of a school makes it difficult to maneuver and access cleaning since parents park on site. The sources that exist could be improved or better changed since they are not the most appropriate. They should consult with the association for guidance."
17265,1561455,3,AiGregal,09/09/2021,"The area is right in front of a school, so from 8 am the siren does not stop sounding every two by three. In our case, a lawnmower was added, passing behind from the first hour. The parking space is small and not delimited and at 10 am it is already full of cars parked without much order, which makes it very difficult to maneuver to get out and depending on how you can get trapped."
17265,1421988,3,aesteban91,08/08/2021,"Good area for loading and unloading, easy entry and level ground, few parking spaces and with water connection, the tap is push-button without a thread."
17265,1411811,4,josemaria27,06/08/2021,"Good area, well organized they enter about 8-10 ac, but there is a parking lot of a school next door where you can also sleep, super next door, beach next door, loading and unloading of water, Good place to spend a few quiet days, it is you can go everywhere on foot"
17265,1407815,5,NomadasCharlatanes,05/08/2021,"We have had a spectacular night. With all the services, parks, super and beach next door. Also attached to the boardwalk. A 10 for this area."

17265,1384213,4,blor,30/07/2021,"Good area, although if they changed the drinking water tap for a threaded one, it would be remarkable high and if they also put an exclusive tap to rinse the poti, the note would be outstanding. The nearby beach, great."
17265,1364972,4,losdopi,25/07/2021,"Small area, very well located. With a pleasant promenade to the town. With filling and emptying service. About 10 vehicles will fit. In summer without problems, but being next to a school and a sports hall during school time it is full of cars. Well, it is not specified as an area itself. It is only forbidden to park cars in the gray dump area"

17265,1312879,4,uxa,11/07/2021,"Great, it is located on the outskirts, quiet area and near a bike path that leads to the center and children's area. Recommended, I do not give it 5 stars because the filling tap does not have a thread and the sewage drain does not have a tap."
17265,1294062,4,aranxa16,03/07/2021,"They have enabled an area where the town sports center to park without problems. Very quiet night, it is a small town. It has gray and black charge and discharge. Nice place."

17265,1288666,4,JavierGonzalezEspinosa,01/07/2021,"We have only emptied and filled. The tap does not have any type of hook, it is like that of a fountain. These types of sites are appreciated"
17265,1246456,4,jcsgalvez,10/06/2021,"Small but quiet and very practical area. It has a slight drawback and that is that there is a school right next door and many parents park, which makes it difficult for the motorhomes to move in a few hours."

17265,1234153,3,ToyTraveller,03/06/2021,"When we arrived at the area it was full of cars parked for school departure. To empty grays we had to tell them to move because they were literally on top of us. To load drinking water, on the wall of the sports center there is a cover with a hose inside. Thanks to the city council for the detail."
17265,1087515,4,CASTELLANO,10/10/2020,"Many thanks to the City Council for doing this area. Very helpful with all services, but I put it to the people who go to the sports center next door and fill it with their cars."

The drinking water is separated from the sewage area that makes it a bit uncomfortable, we have also seen people using the drinking water hose to clean the Poti. Next to the hose there is another water connection to connect the hose itself."
17265,998321,4,Luipi,24/08/2020,"Regarding the issue of the lack of water, we have been able to verify that 15 meters from the discharge point, behind a small aluminum door or hatch in the wall of the sports center next to the entrance gate to it, there is a tap with a small hose that works perfectly. Otherwise it is a good place to sleep and we have not heard a single noise"
17265,982656,1,elixabetege,19/08/2020,"We just moved on to empty / fill the bathroom and were able to empty it, but not fill it as there was no water. The site was full of AC as it is small"

The area is well located: it is very close to the beach, which has operational showers and there is a supermarket very close, and in 5 minutes you are in the center of town."
17265,901137,2,iluari,26/07/2020,"The van is fine for draining, but has only one source of water to clean the toilet and fill with clean water. We had to put on our shoes at dusk. It is 10 minutes from the village, a nice walk. Quiet place, no noise."

17265,536381,2,Anitram,02/07/2019,"Bad taste of mouth that left us our overnight in this area. In the morning we called a tourist to ask if they had water intake since in previous comments we had seen that there was not. We were told that yes (they do have but no thread so if you want to load water you have to put the hose under pressure). They also told us that you could shower in the sports center renting the facilities for about 2.5 euros, but when going to ask in the morning they told us it was like that but you could only shower for not late because in the morning there were sporting events in the pavilion . The parking is shared with vehicles that do not respect the service area .. throughout the afternoon the users of the sports center parked in the emptying area when there is a huge parking lot in the institute at 50mts and there are also signs that prohibit parking for tourism ... but people do not care. In addition, they respect little the rest of the autocarvaanistas. It was 12 o'clock in the night and they left to play a game and people talking and laughing loudly and we were several motorhomes and campeje what we were there (those who had found a gap between so much car) ... definitely do not think we go back"

17302,2555492,3,saarwana,19/01/2023,Outdated place with a small bar. Sanitary urgently needs a decent renovation. Many long-term hibernators.
17302,2306762,5,FabiolaVitali,26/08/2022,"The campsite is really beautiful, the staff are very welcoming and helpful. They have a swimming pool with thermal water with salt water and also a small whirlpool, both of which are well maintained, are the best for a little relaxation. The campsite is located right in front of the sea, just cross the road and you are on a wonderful beach. The sea is very clean"
17302,2159040,2,Bonapart,01/08/2022,much too expensive while there is a great site for motorhomes 3 kilometers away for 15€ with swimming pool and everything...
17302,1963133,2,campiquipugui,10/06/2022,We caught the night there and we were looking for something decent. The site is more or less. There is no shade and it gets a lot of sun. The pool is paid separately (obviously we did not go) and they try to sell you a bathroom for you only when there are community pools. They were clean although the facilities leave something to be desired.
17302,1815521,3,Torfi123,11/04/2022,"In the Easter week 35, - € paid for 2 people and mobile home for one night. I find it too expensive. No shady places. Toilet facilities so-so."
17302,1784126,3,KlausBlau,15/03/2022,"Nice reception, we could choose the pitch ourselves. Pitches are big enough, gravel, have water and electricity. Sanitary facilities clean and well maintained but a bit old. Showers have hot water. WiFi weak."
17302,1780658,3,Udo58,12/03/2022,"Nice, quiet place, the only drawback, disposal of gray water, direct disposal on site but only possible with a hose. Otherwise only via the bucket method. €23 is too expensive there."
17302,1753208,4,josee.vidal,11/02/2022,"Campsite very well maintained and very well located, on the edge of the beach. The reception is very friendly and the contact by email is efficient. The pitches are large. The sanitary facilities are very clean, but a bit old. The price is €23 with only 3 kWh of electricity then €0.65 per additional kWh."
17302,1677497,2,vistanevada,04/11/2021,Very quiet but very run down a shame
17302,1653083,2,UmdieWelt,19/10/2021,"Actually a nice quiet place. But everything is getting on in years and the owners are not interested in clues (e.g. broken toilet flush, washing machine, etc.), questions and the guests. Attention: 3kW electricity included - we cannot understand how we could use so much electricity (we have never used so much electricity on a parking space with a money slot !!)"
17302,1393917,1,pott6,02/08/2021,"Very poorly maintained and very dirty campsite, bathrooms with cockroaches and clogged. Expensive for what it offers."
17302,1241282,1,ManoliPastor,07/06/2021,"Dirty and poorly maintained campsite, it is empty and they do not let you leave after eating you have to leave at 12 very expensive for the service it gives, I will not return"
17302,759861,5,nata82,30/12/2019,"Clean, friendly staff, showers with super hot water. large plots and gravel floor. There are many cats that fixed people feed, our dogs barked at them just like all the dogs that arrived. It has no supermarket, bread in reception. Bar with cheap prices. there are supermarkets very close taking a walk of about 10 '."
17302,422385,4,Calibee2018,13/01/2019,Clean sanitary facilities. Wifi costs extra.
17302,228309,2,Xavierteia,18/03/2018,"Entrance to the parking a bit difficult with an AC of more than 6.5mts. The gray water empties directly into a field outside the campsite, for me it was a big surprise. The WC waters, if they have a specific place, but outside the campsite. They are not prepared for AC. They have thermal pool, it is paid separately."
17302,222568,3,marano29,12/02/2018,"Very well placed compared to the beach but dilapidated sanitary. Thermal pool in the campsite (4.5 €). 21,5 € with electricity (20 € from 4 nights). We took the private sanitary option for € 3.70 more and we were surprised to have to pay 7 kwh of supplement for 7 days mainly due to the private water heater! € 0.46 per kWh anyway."
17302,46513,1,romulus92,05/08/2015,Thieves with my 6 children over 70 € a night
17302,46426,1,romulus92,05/08/2015,"30,00 € instead of 7 € / person + electricity, very expensive"
17302,31047,3,Pierre,11/02/2015,"Small nice campsite. Nothing more. Partly occupied by permanents who come to spend several months in the sun. For the remaining places it is necessary to arrive at the beginning of the afternoon because the turn-over is incessant. Strolls by the sea left out of the campsite, with even some local shops (30 minutes walk), while enjoying a more friendly context ... That the other side more overrated. 18 € the night. Do not take into account the history of Kw / h to pay extra (this must concern the permanent). This is the first time I see electricity meters at each location. Sanitary at least and just heated (3 ° in the morning when we pass)."
17308,3122139,1,VanZitoon,11/08/2023,"it is an overpriced campsite. 900€ for 6 days in August. The pitches are invaded by Dutch caravans with makeshift extensions and tents. They went too far, too big, too luxurious, too expensive, inhumane. There are other much nicer campsites in the region, with direct access to the sea and much cheaper and much more on a human scale. Pass this one."
17308,2838672,5,Bumshumor,10/06/2023,"Great and well-kept campsite with a separate area for dogs. Pitches separated by hedges and clean. Clean showers and toilets, free dishwashers. toilet cleaning machines etc. Internet costs six euros a day, with a red one. But extremely good connection. All around rather little, but great for relaxing and for dog owners."
17308,682370,5,TimDeleu,08/09/2019,Very nice campsite. But quite expensive in the season.
17308,569537,5,Allan214,22/07/2019,"Very good campsite! Very big, plan a bike to get around! Very big location with a lot of shade! Sanitary very clean! Beautiful pool and beautiful sandy beach! A lot of wind when we were there ... only small bad negatives ... the price! 72 € for one night for a couple with a toddler!"
17308,201115,5,redhowe,08/10/2017,"Great kids club which runs throughout the season. In October the cost per night, for a motorhome with 2 adults and 2 kids, was 36€ which is very good considering the quality of services."
17308,153673,5,osbalro,18/07/2017,In high season 75e the night. Go stick! But the spectacular camping!
17308,23569,4,steboucher,19/08/2014,Spot for Windsurf and kite surfing. World Cup stage
17347,2435101,2,Silexxx,10/10/2022,"We use it during the day to eat in the van and then visit Txingudi...there is a lot of movement of people, athletes, walkers, young people without any respect...of course, if you are not interested in visiting the ecological park, you have better places ."
17347,2173085,4,Camperando007,04/08/2022,"Suitable for all motorhomes including, lots of shade and peace. nearby natural oasis"

17347,712830,1,kidicoi,04/10/2019,To avoid.
17347,34099,1,dbfoe,19/04/2015,Really in trouble if you can not find anything else. It is a little cut throat but has the merit of existing.
17347,30131,1,elfossie,29/12/2014,Parking closed at night.
17347,22364,1,TIBIDABO,13/08/2014,"Isolated parking .... out of sight, not bad for the night but no confidence to leave a motorhome unattended the day."
17363,469991,3,Brunnenkuh,28/04/2019,"We stood here one night right on the river with 4 other mobile homes. Very quiet, no problems."
