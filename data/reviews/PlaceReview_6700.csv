89487,2293564,5,SoniaJc,24/08/2022,"A great place to sleep, walk and bathe. There are public showers along the river and picnic tables, we have slept very peacefully."
89487,2156974,4,Saoret,01/08/2022,"We spent the afternoon and evening. It is a narrow parking lot and very busy now in summer because it is next to the river and the public swimming pool. We give it 4 stars because even though there are no services, the place is clean and there are picnic tables and showers to cool off. Until 12 at night there was a lot of movement of cars and people in the picnic area, then we were able to rest well."
89487,1188855,4,CuniOrge,08/05/2021,"The setting is excellent. Parking is something else. It is a fairly narrow place where it is easy to get caught between cars. It has the advantage that the squares are not painted and I parked in a curb where the cars park in battery. My AC was the only one on the weekend (there was no space available, except at night) It is not very level either. I give a 4 because the place is great"
89487,994403,4,alirayo,23/08/2020,Next to the river and the pool. 25 minutes walk from the center of Orense. Very calm.
89487,328978,3,alxbec,12/08/2018,"Sports complex parking with water points and showers, stone tables, close to the river. Also restaurants nearby. We stayed on a Saturday night, it's a parking lot with lots of traffic until late at night, and it starts early in the morning. Add to that the garbage truck on Sunday morning."
89487,312565,5,Bruno44390,03/08/2018,Several bars and restaurants nearby as well as showers in the open air along the river. Very good place for a night.

89488,2892822,5,yoa2703,25/06/2023,The site is great. We slept there one night. We had a hard time finding a place since there are many restrictions.
89488,2155042,4,Gregfit,01/08/2022,"When we passed, there was no trash can and the area was not maintained. Narrow passage in the city to come, to be excluded for large Motorhomes.. ⚠️ No network.. Despite everything, quiet night"

89488,879368,5,falonso,18/07/2020,"We loved it. Very quiet, drinking water fountain and tables around a juniper. We did the night route with the kids and another route in the morning. You have the possibility of reaching Fuentona from here. A lot of people passed us by bike."
89488,439948,4,ArturoVitoria,14/03/2019,"Good site. Drinking water, picnic areas and barbecues. There are no containers, so it is somewhat neglected in terms of cleanliness."
89488,388625,4,Fernandofercu,06/10/2018,Great place for a stop and for the night There is no mobile coverage (At least movistar)

89508,793653,4,lert,10/03/2020,"A small and uneven place, only for vans, a lot of firewood and a place for a fire, water in 1 meter, 3g norms, no one bothers, the police saw - did not say anything."
89508,427726,1,hedima,09/02/2019,"Site with good access for vans but once you get to the place there is no where to put the van, bad care, a lot of garbage, there is no flat access where to put you."
89511,2561482,5,OliverMeier,27/01/2023,I can sleep one night without problem. The police come but nothing is said. It is a place with a lot of sun and super quiet.
89511,946428,1,ignvioqrom,10/08/2020,"We spent the day and night without problem, but in the morning the port police came taking pictures of the parked motorhomes to report them. Parking is prohibited because it is a port."
89511,937979,5,lolivan,08/08/2020,"Small port without restrictions or parking problems and overnight. It is completely flat. We have slept very well and very calm. In addition to having fantastic views, beach next door, restaurants 5 minutes away. Perfect ."
89511,872525,4,PabloyBorja,16/07/2020,Perfect to spend the day and night. Next to 2 beaches. Restoration 5 min walk. It belongs to a small port. No problem parking. Shared with passenger cars that come to fish late in the day.

89568,2963654,3,Gtudor,14/07/2023,we went by to see if we wanted to stay but didn't really feel like staying there. but it is flat and I imagine quiet. I can imagine it is fine for one night sleep and leave. drinking water tap at back of health centre
89568,697821,4,asturmano,20/09/2019,"Small fairly level area next to the Triacastela health center, pleasant to spend the night, although in the morning the doctor and the workers from the center come. Super quiet place, very close to a small park with a source of drinking water."
89617,1872626,5,GuyHomtel,06/05/2022,"A pleasant place. Certainly during the day walkers, often with their dog, walk around, but no one spends the night. Cows and horses quietly please in the meadow. You can also see storks. Ideal for one night."
89617,964898,5,krufki,15/08/2020,Very good area to sleep in tranquility and to be able to wake up next to grazing horses.
89617,708759,4,Unimog5000,30/09/2019,"In the evening many walkers with dogs, but very quiet at night. Easily accessible from the N-234, just follow the signs to Parque Valonsadero. There are no toilets directly at this parking lot, only a trash can"
89617,440770,4,ArturoVitoria,17/03/2019,"Any of the parkings that are in the area of Valonsadero, is fully recommended. Those who are far from the recreational area and bar, the quietest. There are many routes through the forest, and the route that leads to Pedrajas is advisable. To enjoy."
89617,379749,4,Alineetmarc,22/09/2018,Super location quiet and surrounded by nature. 4 stars only because people are lazy to put the papers in the big trash available.
89644,2521805,4,MaxWamsler,14/12/2022,"a bit slanted, the only drawback. But great view! don't be afraid of the wind at night, it's a bit strong."
89644,2476419,5,sfv,01/11/2022,Spectacular views. Space for about 6 or 7 motorhomes.
89644,2472498,5,NataliaFuente,30/10/2022,"We have had a great night. Road with little traffic on these dates. Beautiful sunset and sunrise. Please, do not show that you have been, leave it as you found it. So we can all continue to enjoy these wonders."
89644,2015427,5,rosaamarilla,27/06/2022,Nice place...impressive views...beautiful...at 17 degrees...what more could you ask for.
89644,1493581,4,luiland,21/08/2021,A place with nice views and great for walking on easy trails. Herds of cows and horses can be seen in the wild.
89644,1383038,5,jomateix,30/07/2021,"Excellent. Like all necks, windy, but other than that, it's a great place."
89644,1352378,4,aipife,22/07/2021,"Great, off the road but little traveled. Being at a high altitude, despite being a hot week in July, there was a lot of humidity that got into the car (luckily we were prepared). If you want to cook, there is probably wind."
89644,1159949,4,indycamper,28/03/2021,"Site with beautiful views, and close to several routes to do some trekking (perfect for a night pass or rest). A negative point is that it is very close to the road and depending on the time of year there can be a lot of car traffic that goes up to La Molina and the nearby ski lifts."
89644,1159600,4,Josep324,28/03/2021,"Good place, good views and quiet at night. Quite crowded during the day."

89645,3282454,5,evallespin,10/09/2023,"It is already renovated and you can sleep, confirmed as of September 9, 2023 with the security personnel who are there to enter the campsite, I hope they do not prohibit it soon. There are several caravans and vans. Access to the river beach where there is a bar. Very nice and well renovated place."
89645,2628787,1,Pampoum,29/03/2023,The area was under construction in January when I visited. No placement or accessible parking. I was still able to park at the entrance to the park with the permission of the guard. But there was only room for a motorhome and the U-turn was tight.
89645,2619816,1,Wunderkinder,22/03/2023,"Unfortunately, the place is completely closed due to construction work, no coming in and no standing possible. It's a shame, I wouldn't put myself on the square next to the campsite either, it wouldn't be okay. Unfortunately, after a long journey, we had to continue our journey."
89645,2534583,5,zigalpt,30/12/2022,"Went today and it was open. Amazing place for a piknik or to spend the night. Plenty of parking (just the entrance is a bit steep). Showers, Toilets, Playground, football field. Just next to the Science Museum."

no access
............."
89645,2175962,4,Laf_76620,04/08/2022,"Nice quiet place from 7 p.m. after the departure of the beach attendants. Outdoor showers to wash up in the morning. Toilets also, very clean, but closed at night. Overall very good spot."
89645,2112544,3,coroas,23/07/2022,"Quiet place to spend the night and during the day enjoy the river beach which is very close. There are no clean and dirty water services. The floor is dirt/sand, some holes. Ideal to be close to nature!"
89645,1980881,4,carrypana,15/06/2022,"We spent 2 nights, June 12th and 13th we arrived on Sunday and the park was very full, but overnight we only stayed 3 campervans and all with dogs. quiet place at night, during the day as it was very hot, the beach was full of people who left garbage everywhere and the bathrooms and kitchen were very dirty."
89645,1967162,4,BrunoMilitao,11/06/2022,Excellent place to stay overnight in June! There were only two campervans and plenty of space to enjoy. The sandwiches and hamburgers at Alojamento Local Olhos de Água are very good!
89645,1905454,4,LoboeNhola,21/05/2022,Excellent place to stay in May. We recommend a visit to the live science center and walks along the local trails.
89645,1802113,5,kmauser,31/03/2022,Was here alone on a Thursday in late March. There is even a cave and a small canyon. Above the Praia between the bat lounge and the creek you will find the entrance.
89645,912366,4,lifeaswevan,30/07/2020,Great spot to spend the night! Right now there are signs that forbid overnight but we didn’t notice them until the morning and nobody said anything... there were 4 other rv’s there plus a car with a tent (it was a sunday-monday)
89645,876900,5,jcgjpv,18/07/2020,"Due to the contingency plan of covid19, overnight stays are strictly prohibited. we can, however, stay overnight in Alcanena and come in the morning. park with lots of shadows and about 300m from the river beach."
89645,867239,4,ToInfinityAndBeyond,14/07/2020,Very refreshing river beach. Possibility to park in between the olive trees but not much shade. Bumpy access and plenty of potholes. At the moment is not allowed to stay for the night.
89645,819499,1,atos1,08/06/2020,Absolutely full on weekends! And then party until 2am :-( And on the way jeeps and dirtebiks. No thanks !!!
89645,813884,5,Ranger1T,31/05/2020,"Charming .. Quiet place, surrounding area to walk or do Btt. 10 stars"
89645,796426,5,pozdrozoVanie,18/03/2020,Lovely parking between olives trees. We were here 3 nights. Very quiet. There is a few ways if you want to walk and relax. Water is only available from the showers. There is no tap.
89645,648091,4,gagounette,21/08/2019,"Quiet enough, not bad for the night"
89645,642762,4,Truun,19/08/2019,"Not recommended for weekends in summer ... too many people and some dirt in the parking area. It has a path between mountains that reaches some grottos with bats and water areas, we did not find the entrance to the grotto, a couple from the town showed us everything beautiful about the place, they guided us great to continue visiting the area! We sleep peacefully, without noise and a lot of shade"
89645,506014,5,Vever64,06/06/2019,A great place for a quiet night.
89655,3285999,3,parkaspt,11/09/2023,Dog beach. Please note that it is not a sandy beach but a rocky one (take appropriate footwear).
89655,3235185,5,gusaez,29/08/2023,"I repeat so as not to have a scare like what happened to me. You have to enter from the national direction Villajoyosa. It is a narrow entrance. In any case, when you enter, if Maps takes you through a modern urbanization, turn around because the road is terrible and you can't even get through with a small van (pass with the bike). When you enter the place must seem “shabby” to you, then you are fine. The ideal beach with a dog atmosphere."
89655,3013194,5,Marimorena,24/07/2023,"We had a great weekend in July, it was not crowded, we went with our dog and it was great since there were many more dogs, all sociable. There were containers, the beach was clean, but there was no sign of the beach bar that they have put up in other years. Next to the beach and the fact that you can go with the dog is the best, I hope there are more coves/beaches like this"
89655,2959325,1,FORDMONKEYS,13/07/2023,"Access is somewhat complicated but you can get there without problems if it hasn't rained, the beach is fine but the problem is that since it is a dog beach there are many people who should not go out or go out on the street and do not pick up their dog's feces so it's all full of dog poop, no problems with the police."
89655,2869307,5,kars10,19/06/2023,"Rough road access, certainly unsuitable for long campers. Busy weekend, lots of dogs. Great vibe, with nice people. Parking is not a problem for the police - they tend to take care of the anglers"
89655,2729029,2,SaskiaCarolin,06/05/2023,"Unfortunately no access, was locked"
89655,2643690,5,Baloobrownie,06/04/2023,"One of the best in the area if you travel with a dog and Camper. Great camper atmosphere, the police pass but do not say anything if everything is in order. Beach for dogs so there is no limitation in that regard. The access is a bit complicated full of potholes but it can be accessed."
89655,2616777,2,IBakkenI,20/03/2023,"Very nice place, BUT! there are lots of broken glass bottles and people leaving faeces and toilet paper all over the place. unfortunately this ruins the whole experience at the place for me. if you're going here, it's also important that your dog gets along with others, as most dogs run loose on the site."
89655,2562982,4,Juanangarcia,29/01/2023,"Perfect area to spend a day, very quiet with a beach for dogs. In summer they put a beach bar. Access by dirt slope is regular, be careful with cars over 7 meters"
89655,2542600,5,marifelixova,05/01/2023,"We spent 2 nights on Christmas Eve. Police came and said nothing, just passed through and checked. Calm, beautiful spot. Nice for walks around."
89655,2449375,3,fran649,17/10/2022,"Bad access for large motorhomes, there are branches of trees that you have to be very careful with the height, road with a lot of slope and irregular terrain. There is a ""No camping"" sign and it looked like a flea market."
89655,2449266,4,santigol,17/10/2022,"A wonderful place with spectacular views of sunrise and sunset, it is also a beach for pets which is better. The worst thing is the access to get there but it is easily reached"
89655,2433851,3,Zoupette,09/10/2022,beautiful view of the sea whose beach is below with seaweed. very bumpy parking lot
89655,2340691,4,Thomano,05/09/2022,"We arrived at the end of the day and found a carefree place facing the sea for the van Small open beach bar. Lovely people, place with stunning sea view! Large space to park. No height limit and dogs accepted on the beach!"
89655,2204259,2,DrakkarVan_T6,09/08/2022,"Place that could be 5 stars if we picked up our trash. In addition, there are people who are not aware of their dogs, which generates a bit of discomfort. There were quite a few people with awnings, tables, chairs... it seems that it is ""allowed"". There is a beach bar but no services. Beautiful sunrise and sunset."
89655,2006103,5,VHS,24/06/2022,Perfect place to spend the night. Quiet. Next to the water. No services of any kind.
89655,1941977,5,coucouvirages,03/06/2022,"Incredible spot!! The feet in water. Clean, we were few vans, during the week, at the beginning of June. It seems that the weekend is full."
89655,1868088,5,momoswildlife,03/05/2022,Perfect place. A little bumpy descent. When it rains it gets muddy quickly. no service But the place. the calm. The view. Top
89655,1807137,4,sascharoe,05/04/2022,Super quiet spot right on the water. If you climb one of the mountains/hills to the left or right of it you have a brilliant view of the bay and the small village.
89655,1724580,2,MoquiOnTour,03/01/2022,"Camping prohibited sign, actually a fantastic spot on earth. Unfortunately littered, excrement and urine stench everywhere. Garbage flies around, very pronounced camping behavior with tables and chairs, awnings and pavilion. The aggregates are running, and they are also very loud. The way down is difficult, but not impossible. It would work up to 6 m in length and with some ground clearance."
89655,1702524,2,Elodiebahurlet,03/12/2021,we were directed for a single route by the GPS which is not at all accessible for campsites because we therefore could not go
89655,1624623,1,AngelWolf,03/10/2021,"Perfect parkin to spend the day and night, in an incredible place but if you do not stop setting up camps with awnings, tables and chairs and you do not collect your poop and throw it into the container at the end, do you know what will happen? Well, you will end this paradise. The state of the area over the years is shameful. It takes a bit of collective environmental awareness, folks."
89655,1588546,1,nacho21436,18/09/2021,"Just a few meters before reaching the beach, they have put up a forbidden address plate and a flooded area, so it is not possible to pass with vehicles, if someone enters, they already know what they are exposed to."
89655,1530881,4,JnyGts,30/08/2021,Superb place for dogs and their owners. festival sanitary facilities present and clean. small bar also present. really great
89655,1280908,3,AliciaCamacho,27/06/2021,I give him three for the access is very bad the last stretch is scary potholes and man on one side only takes a vehicle then the site is good
89655,1150878,5,japecli,13/03/2021,Lovely and charming place. We have spent the day and very well. The Police have come but as the vans were closed and we were sitting on the beach there was no problem
89655,1121081,5,Cristi4night,13/12/2020,We had a very quiet night with the van. In the morning several fishing cars arrived. Pebble beach with beautiful views and walk to a watchtower.
89655,1056943,5,vintagecamperfamily,18/09/2020,Nice stone beach and walks around up to the ruins. nice swimming on the other side of the hill with some coral and fish for snorkeling. there is alot of rubbish along the river bed but a garbage bin in the car park which we cleared the carpark and dumped two bags of rubbish. no problem with access in a 3.5t motorhome.
89655,984210,4,camperpiccola,20/08/2020,"Perfect for sleeping and spending one or several days. Parking at the foot of the canine beach. No services. The negative part is that there is a lot of dust, and many people do not spend the night, but rather they camp as if they were in a campsite. The entrance and exit road has a lot of potholes, but it goes down without problem."
89655,792040,4,DrivingDeeDee,07/03/2020,Great spot and no police came down to check whilst we were there for 3 days. Two of the roads coming in are really bad and uneven but the middle one going straight down from the main road to the turning circle area and parkup is fine! There are also bins but no other services and campsites round here don't let you pay to use theirs if you're not staying on their site (we tried for the toilet).
89655,790064,5,KintonVan,02/03/2020,"I loved it, camping is prohibited, but they don't say anything to spend the night, at least on March 1 when I went. Absolute tranquility, a super clean cove and during the day there are several coves around to visit very cool too."
89655,743394,5,cuatro4s,15/11/2019,A very quiet place with nothing around and on a beach for stone dogs.
89655,698899,4,Crack8,21/09/2019,Perfect for one night
89655,600877,4,Alexismarine,05/08/2019,"Very nice and quiet place at the edge of the beach gallets. No worries with the police despite the ban on camping. She goes to take a look simply. Provide shoes for sensitive feet for swimming. No worries for camper access, for the dog's beach some holes in the descent but largely feasible."
89655,410081,1,JuergenD,25/11/2018,At the entrance is a large sign that prohibits camping
89655,393403,4,flax004,14/10/2018,"We have spent one night in this place. very quiet, with a pebble beach. There were two other vans that had been there for a couple of days."
89672,3245624,4,titojosef,01/09/2023,"Very nice place to spend the night, the cove is not very crowded, it has enough places. The police came at 9 in the morning and only asked us to remove some swimsuits that were drying outside. Otherwise great."
89672,3160049,5,ares_masip,16/08/2023,"The track down to the car park is short but steep. It goes down and up perfectly. Very quiet place. Those in the cove bar leave the toilet open during the night, it has water and is clean. We slept with about 7-8 other vans but no noise whatsoever. At the foot of a cove that is not overcrowded"
89672,2356338,5,iznajar93,09/09/2022,We have spent the night totally alone. Super quiet and recommended place Access is a bit complicated perhaps for motorhomes.
89672,2130580,4,Looc,27/07/2022,"The cove is wonderful, very beautiful and without overcrowding in the month of July. quiet night The downside is the poor access (only for vans, no ACs), and since the car park is sheltered, there is no air and it is hot."
89672,1738150,4,Darialola,21/01/2022,"Very nice place (a beautiful cove), little traffic. We slept there one night. Access is however difficult, lots of crevasses and big bumps, very steep (we had a few scares...). No or very little internet."
89672,1575571,5,khancamper,13/09/2021,"Magnificent place to spend the night with more campers, the bathroom of the bar is open. A 10 to the cove."
89672,1523805,5,ainarius,28/08/2021,"We spent 2 nights in the second half of August. The first we spent with many vans, I don't know if it was a weekend and the second practically alone. It is a very quiet place, at night we saw hardly any movement and in the morning a few people who are going to SUP. The bathrooms in the cove are open at any time."
89672,1457641,5,gotzONgotzOFF,14/08/2021,"Very quiet place, being in the middle of August we slept almost alone. It is located on the beach and has a swimming pool. Decent people go to dinner and need to be booked. Highly recommended."
89672,1380528,4,sulleyontherun,30/07/2021,"Nice parking lot, nice bay. Quiet. Steep slope, difficult with the camper"
89672,1308207,5,JuananMontNico,09/07/2021,"We went down to sleep with a 72 cb and 6 m long van. The site is very handsome. Quiet, next to the cove. Large site and, if there is not much car, you can turn around. Few cars after 9pm. ALERT! The next day we left at 11 am, there was already a lot of car and getting the van was almost impossible because we did not have space to pick up speed and the steepness of the slope."
89672,1282065,5,nurmonbel,27/06/2021,"With the van without problem to go down and go up despite the steep access. Perfect pine forest with some shade. The beach bar already open. Around 00:00 the police came down but did not tell us anything because we were parked, we were already in the van and we had not removed anything from tables or chairs."
89672,986389,4,jordiFurgo,20/08/2020,Very good view at sunset and a perfect cove for snorkelling. Closed chiringuito (covid) but perfect to spend the night in La Pineda.

89672,773941,2,sonased,29/01/2020,"It is a pretty place, but the access was really bad now in winter  :( might be different in the summer but narrow road that is not even paved all the way with a lot of potholes. The parking space is not too big, but I'd say it's very peaceful as there is pretty much nothing in this small beach."
89672,630933,1,antho43,15/08/2019,Very difficult to access and restaurant at the edge of lamer poorly polite server and impossible to eat at 14:30. we do not recommend at all to FUIR ....
89672,446241,2,ibizamotorhome,29/03/2019,"The cove is very beautiful but accessible with small vehicles NO motorhomes. Difficult access for motorhomes or large vehicles, narrow road, broken and bumpy. Difficult to turn around or pass by another vehicle. Better to avoid"

89688,949606,3,Ripleyboy,11/08/2020,Great spot to visit the beach during the day. Would be very noisy at night as it is on a busy road. There is a small market just down the road on Monday morning.

89688,351461,4,Patxix9,24/08/2018,"Ideal to rest, eat or go to the beach. The views are very good. I do not see it well to sleep because of the proximity of the road. Without services, it is a wasteland between the road and the beach."

No service and there is a fountain but no fillet"
89692,2095230,4,Benouej,19/07/2022,"Very nice view of the sea from this spot. Located on a parking lot on the edge of the cliffs, it is better to arrive early enough to have space. A food truck is right next door."

Be careful because the area near the river is used as a toilet and is full of bombs and papers, especially if you let your pets loose.

89819,3050065,4,furgoclimbing,31/07/2023,"The parking lot is right at a height which makes the air run, during the stay we had problems with the electricity supply."
89819,3013306,5,isracari,24/07/2023,"simply wonderful, I wish they were all the same, and the employees were very nice"
89819,3012443,3,RalfSommer,24/07/2023,a nice place but there is absolutely no shady place to park. New toilets but left very dirty by campers. Only 2 pieces for men and women.
89819,2999652,4,leiatami,21/07/2023,good place with pool
89819,2989880,5,LRamos,19/07/2023,"Very good, pity is the distance to the beach."
89819,2956498,5,jolynol,13/07/2023,"I'm so glad we found this little oasis on our travels. Spacious parking, friendly staff, showers and toilets. Even a little bar where we bought some fresh churros for breakfast. Everything was very clean and we had a quiet nights sleep. The pool was a welcome break from the beach and very well maintained. Will most definitely come back! Thank you!"
89819,2956310,5,igomezal,12/07/2023,"A good place to rest, very well equipped and complete, even with a nice pool"
89819,2954881,5,PratReef,12/07/2023,"An area of 10, very friendly and attentive people. A good place to rest for a few days to visit Isla Cristina and surroundings."
89819,2951683,4,garmingr,11/07/2023,"A great area, thanks for the nice treatment of the receptionist. Good services, great pool. The only downside is the misuse of some users making noise until late at night"
89819,2937581,5,amilpin080,08/07/2023,"Perfect to come in summer with children. Cristina and Goreti at the reception are always very nice. There is a new kiosk with churros (€1.50), tapas, sangria... (popular prices). We have coincided with the owners Fran and Rocío, very nice, also motorhome drivers. It runs cool in the shade, and at night even a sweatshirt. Two weekends in a row, the atmosphere very quiet?"
89819,2929926,4,Javi_Coyanza,06/07/2023,"Very nice, well-kept and quiet place. Pleasant stay and very friendly attention. Little shade. Pool available to take the heat off."
89819,2904334,5,yulietta,29/06/2023,"It is a very nice quiet place and if you bring children they have a swimming pool, laundry, small store and the necessary services for the stay...everything is clean and cozy...you can enter after the hours that reception says...in my case I called to verify the entrance and they did not put any problem ... the truth is that few places are also there ... there should be more ... thank you very much"

89819,2830686,4,saraujo,07/06/2023,"Good welcome, organization and cleanliness. But with the high value for the location. It is not understood that if it is a Campervan with 2 adults + 2 children, it is the value indicated. If your child is of legal age, you will be charged €3 more. Why? If you are in the same motorhome and if you want to use the changing rooms, do you have to pay €1/shower? And they charge €2 more if it's only 1 night. Overkill"
89819,2829079,4,pskusa,07/06/2023,very nice and friendly welcome! All you need. But extra 2-€ only if you stand for one night ?????Why
89819,2813615,5,famvani,02/06/2023,Great pitch! Very friendly and helpful! Fair price. great pool ;-)
89819,2812609,5,alfoxa,02/06/2023,"It is a very good place with all services 25 minutes walk from Isla Cristina. There is a swimming pool. A huge thank you to Goretti for his kindness, his availability and his help. Alex and Evelyn"
89819,2704322,4,mherrm,28/04/2023,Nice pitch. Toilet cabins very narrow. €3 extra for the pool is a bit excessive.
89819,2703028,5,GeoffinSpain,28/04/2023,Very nice site. Clean friendly staff. Can recommend.
89819,2680563,5,Slakkie3,19/04/2023,what a great place. friendly people. sanitary is clean. nice view of the marshes. sorry we had to move on..
89819,2673411,5,CACAHUEfamily,16/04/2023,"Absolutely great . Friendly from the arrival and very good attention, wide and level squares. Warm bread and croissants in the morning. Very cool salty pool to rest. Everything very clean. Shower system you need exact amount in coins for hot water. Near Salinas, far from the town and beach. Restaurant nearby. We will be back ."
89819,2666396,5,Carapat,13/04/2023,a motorhome area at the top. Thank you to the whole team for welcoming us with our coach.
89819,2664498,5,JorgeDuarte,12/04/2023,"Received with great sympathy, everything well organized and clean. There is no noise from cars nearby and a landscape as far as the eye can see. I just didn't like having to pay €3 to use the pool. It costs €12 a day without electricity."
89819,2662466,5,Pedro_the_van,11/04/2023,"We spent 3 nights over the Easter weekend, we paid £40 no charge for dogs. Showers €1 per 5 mins, water was hot and cubicle clean. No toilet paper provided so take your own. Didn't use the pool which is €3 per day which I thought reasonable.
Staff awesomely friendly, little shop for essentials. Lidl 20min bicycle ride away, Tobac 5 min walk. Really nice camper park"
89819,2637301,1,WilmasWoMo,03/04/2023,"We paid €20 for a parking space, dirty showers, cold water also cost extra. pool extra."

89819,2632083,4,vanpielo,31/03/2023,"Super pitch. With electricity 16€. Pool currently costs 3 € per day per person. Clean and friendly. Unfortunately, the showers smelled very unpleasant (manure). Still recommended. We were even let in at 10:46 p.m. and were allowed to choose a seat - payment the next morning."
89819,2631282,5,maryps,30/03/2023,"Neat and clean camper area, there is no shade but it is ventilated. Washing machines, refreshment point, spotless bathrooms, very kind staff. They accept dogs. I have not tried the swimming pool. Current 10 A. We spent 2 pleasant nights. With acsi 15 card euros per day Highly recommended!"
89819,2624312,4,travelfamilyandapug,25/03/2023,"A great place, the only drawback: you stand relatively close together. Otherwise, the place is ideal for dog owners. The washing machines and dryers look almost like new, all in all really well maintained. The receptionist was super helpful and friendly and you get essentials on site including ice cream. Supply and disposal is clean and included in the price, the pool costs extra."
89819,2623744,5,Tinytruck,25/03/2023,We really liked the place. Price-performance fits. We'd love to come back.
89819,2602132,5,Dutchwheelz,07/03/2023,"Good place to stay when you need some electricity and like a secure area where you can also arrive pretty late at night. large spaces and friendly staff. 2 tourist town attractions and the natural reserve to visit by bike as attractions. showers need coins, toilets bring your own toilet paper. easy camper water refill and grey water and cassette dump."
89819,2597669,5,papouK,04/03/2023,"Discovered in 2018, this spot has become a reference to the point that some criticize its success. We remain unconditional enthusiasts of this place: it is practical, functional, the electricity is now at 10A. Prices remain competitive, electricity is billed on consumption (minus the 4kW included in the package). ACSI card is accepted. Well-thought-out service platform."
89819,2592048,2,mogette,26/02/2023,"Surely a correct area on the dedicated pitches but if like us there is no more space you find yourself under the trees without electricity and suddenly you feel the profit of the managers, you pile up. If you stay only one night it costs you 2€ more. Morality if there is no more room, it is better to leave."
89819,2591583,5,Tonnsinis,26/02/2023,Nice clean place with everything you need. Friendly operators. Washing machine and dryer €4.50. Toilets and showers are small but nice. We will be back.
89819,2584664,5,LaurentEdouard,20/02/2023,"Superb motorhome area, warm welcome, very well kept, small grocery store for breakdown assistance as well as gas, beautiful swimming pool. Close to Isla Cristina and these very beautiful beaches. Thanks to the whole team for their kindness."
89819,2583662,3,ChrisRabe,19/02/2023,"Pickepacke close to close-full occupies the place! Friendly man sent me away to try again next day. Since I didn't like the situation, I drove on."
89819,2579548,3,chantaldante,16/02/2023,"Large gravel area with all services €12 per night + €4 for electricity €3 for the pool, otherwise €5 for services only but a bit far from the town of Isla Cristina. We spent a quiet night but at the bottom of the area because full at 12€ per night before continuing our journey."
89819,2571670,4,guantxu,08/02/2023,"Good area with all services. The receptionist Sta. Goreti, very kind and friendly. I do not give 5 stars for the bathrooms, for certain people they are super small"
89819,2564661,5,Philippepp,30/01/2023,hello for information you have 4000w included in the parking lot beyond o.50 of the additional kw individual meters are installed at each location you can ask for a consumption statement at the reception whenever you want for the sanitary facilities it seems to me that we have some all in our vehicles
89819,2564444,3,UteHuebner,30/01/2023,"You ladies in the reception area are very nice. Unfortunately the space is limited as there are all the services. The place was overcrowded with a waiting area on the side, too few toilets and showers. The existing ones are an impertinence for tall, strong people. Alternative option: handicapped area. WiFi worked poorly in the back seat. Good bike paths."
89819,2564255,4,fleurette05,30/01/2023,beautiful area of cc 12euros plus 4 euros electricity for 4kwh 24h we do not know what it corresponds to 4 nights spent 6 euros extra for excess electricity??
89819,2561177,3,RoMa2915,26/01/2023,"On 01/24/2023, for one night Ok. Very narrow toilets, showers 1 €, otherwise only cold water, dishes and washroom. Electric 4kw incl. more costs extra. 15€ with ACSI card."
89819,2560404,3,Gillesgarcia,25/01/2023,"Large secure car park on stable and flat ground. Cramped toilets. It would be good to indicate, in the description (p4night, acsi,...), that an increase of 2 € is applied when you stay there only one night."
89819,2559825,5,julia312,24/01/2023,"We stayed here for 2 nights, everything you need was there. The area is good for walking or cycling. It is best to reserve in advance, as the place is full even in the off-season. When we arrived the place was already full, but we were allowed to stand at the end of the line."
89819,2553989,3,B.Niebroek,17/01/2023,"It is a beautiful motorhome, beautiful view, quiet at night. Sanitary is too little toilet very tight, with your knees against the door. Swimming pool is nice. We stayed here for 3 nights. The billing of electricity went strange. In our opinion we have paid too much despite the Asci. Tried to explain this to the reception lady but she didn't understand or act like this."
89819,2551735,3,mjtaylor66,14/01/2023,"Very busy when we were here, perhaps too busy, still taking in vans and parking them on the end of rows and in an adjacent field. Pitches are average size, for the size of the park to only have 2 female and 2 male toilets and showers seems a little thin for me. €16 euro per night for frontline pitch plus electricity, we had ACSI so 4kw of electric is free"
89819,2520036,4,steso,12/12/2022,Good pitch. we paid 14 euros for one night without electricity including drainage and supply. Everything has to be paid extra...
89819,2515170,4,RodantPelMon,07/12/2022,"it's a camping-type stay area, where you pay supplements for everything: swimming pool, per additional person, electricity... the facilities are aged, the village is 3km away..."
89819,2514396,5,kristdom,06/12/2022,"Well-equipped motorhome area, clean, easy to access, practicable in the event of heavy rain. The girls at the reception are very nice We recommend"
89819,2508740,5,carlgns,29/11/2022,fantastic area. It is very careful and clean and has beautiful views and sunsets. You can go by bike to Isla Cristina and even Ayamonte
89819,2504301,4,wilmarja,24/11/2022,"Beautiful places with a bit of luck also fantastic views. Flamingos on the doorstep! A star deduction for the few sanitary facilities, which are all kept very clean! Also the landfill for black (4 pieces) and gray (2 pieces)"
89819,2502387,3,park4nightgisou,21/11/2022,"Very nice, impeccable welcome, the hostess speaks impeccable French; everything is clean, well organized, all the services are excellent Pitches delimited with small groves, gravel on the ground. I will add only one downside: the toilets are so narrow that a tall person with long legs has problems sitting down: his knees touch the door!!!!!!!"
89819,2502016,5,ingrid-ken,21/11/2022,everything is great!!
89819,2499088,5,Patrice1961,18/11/2022,we spent 48 hours ... clean and quiet .. the white wine from the region is excellent ... I recommend 1000 percent
89819,2489344,4,CorinaHR,10/11/2022,Very nice pitch with a great view and very quiet.
89819,2423009,2,damavis,04/10/2022,"The Area is quite mediocre and very expensive, they charge you for everything, the base price is €12, from there you add one night +€2, for bathing in a pool that is not 30 cm deep + €3, for electricity + €4, for showers+, for water +, for emptying wc……. In short, for everything much more expensive than in any campsite…"
89819,2422916,3,barba1,04/10/2022,"Good area to visit Isla Cristina and Ayamonte. They charge you €3 to use the pool, €1 more if you're in the front row and €2 more if you're only there for one day. The skin is the skin."
89819,2392455,2,Nievitas,21/09/2022,"the area is fine, but it does not seem normal to me that for staying only one night, the most common in a motorhome, they charge you a supplement of two euros, already having a high average price for this type of accommodation"
89819,2385228,4,AnnieEmme,19/09/2022,"Very nice area, very clean and nice owners. There is a swimming pool which is also accessible to wheelchair users. A bit in the middle of nowhere, despite the fact that there are salt flats with flamingos in front of them. Nearby there are Ayamonte and Isla Cristina, reachable by bicycle or motorbike (on foot it is really far). Washing machine and dryer € 4.5; service of croissants and freshly baked bread. 19 + 2 € x 1 night."
89819,2385217,3,mamenurti,19/09/2022,"fabulous area. The prices for mid and high season seem a bit expensive to me since they include a fabulous pool, but if you are not going to use it... In the end, with the ACSI it did not go wrong for me. The worst thing is that it is far from everything. to go to the beach you have to move the AC and to walk and have dinner in the town, there is a good walk. However, we will surely return, since there is little to choose from in the area"
89819,2358316,3,mivisvan,10/09/2022,"Correct place to spend the night and very friendly owners. But it has not convinced us that they charge you €1 for 5 minutes of showering that even if you turn off the tap time continues to run, there is also no toilet paper in the two tiny bathrooms."
89819,2356045,5,vandreamer55,09/09/2022,"An area that looks like a campsite, 10 facilities and very friendly staff. It also offers beautiful sunsets and views of the Isla Cristina marshes. 25 min by bike to Ayamonte and 10 to Isla Cristina. totally recommended"
89819,2346005,5,LimaFox,06/09/2022,"Fully equipped camper stop, overlooking the salt pans. Beautiful pool area, large pitches, well-kept services and very kind managers. We did not use it but they also rent bicycles (for a fee), to be considered given the area. Absolutely recommended."
89819,2326864,5,cariass,01/09/2022,"It seems to me a very very correct area, one of the few that exist with a swimming pool. Beautiful views, good location for walking, doing activities in the salt flats, buying good tuna and preserves, good gastronomy... The managers are very cordial and polite. New and clean facilities. It breathes calm and tranquility. And also if you want a day at the beach it is a short bike ride away. A different area"
89819,2279480,3,javimultivant4,21/08/2022,"The site is very good, the pool area is very nice... what seems embarrassing to us is that people go to eat leaving their towels occupying the hammocks since there are only 12 hammocks and 70 plots... a little of respect towards others would not be bad"
89819,2258661,3,sannni,18/08/2022,"We went on our way to Seville, for the price of €24, the toilets are scarce and lack cleanliness, even in the dishwashing area, people are not vigilant… there are many caravans planted and people who are there during the season. A bit of noise gave us the feeling that at night the volume was too high from some neighbors. In any case, improving the cleanliness of the toilet and the size of the said and toilet (they are tiny) is well located, you have what you need. There is an area for washing machines and at the reception they sell little things that we may miss, the very nice receptionist! The pool a bit overcrowded and not very clean. Good area with little would improve a lot, anyway we were good and it was ideal for us to make a stop on the way!"
89819,2258618,5,Inmaculin,17/08/2022,Great motorhome area. Super attentive staff. Complete services and very clean. The views of the very beautiful marshes.
89819,2258132,3,lielie,17/08/2022,"It's not what it seems. Staff very good. The pool is very small and dirty. For the number of plots it has, there are few, very small and dirty showers and toilets. Little cleaning. Rest hours are not respected."
89819,2257972,3,PilarOrtiz,17/08/2022,The area is very well serviced and the staff very good but a lot of noise from families with children. They do not respect rest hours.
89819,2202020,4,CandidoPradas,09/08/2022,"Area for AC, caravans and vans, not tents! People think it is a campsite and it is not. We spent three nights and it was great, everything was very clean, including bathrooms and showers. Antonio super attentive to everyone and everything. He empathizes a lot with the children, the pool at night is amazing. Very nice views, there are beautiful flamingos."
89819,2195140,5,Momi,08/08/2022,"The area is still ten, what had been maintained as the first day, and every time I return there is something new. The site is spectacular and make no mistake, it is a motorhome area, it is not a campsite, all services, and very attentive staff, Antonio is a crack, and the price is very good."
89819,2187837,5,ccauto,06/08/2022,"Very good campervan park, spacious and airy without being on top of others. Unloading and supply area included in the price. Clean bathrooms with showers at 1 euro 5 minutes. Pool area with good chairs and sun loungers. Friendly staff at reception. At the reception there is a space with some utensils and food products available for purchase. I recommend"
89819,2184305,5,leti1984,06/08/2022,Beautiful site. Very friendly owners and environment to repeat. Definitely a place where we will return
89819,2180192,3,cristina29,05/08/2022,"Area with wide squares, level, although with many mosquitoes. Paid showers. It seems quite expensive to me for what it offers, €20 without electricity, just sleeping for one night. If you go at night, be careful because the GPS sends you somewhere else and it doesn't look good. It is passing a gas station with deep potholes, to the right, not to the left (there are the marshes)."
89819,2150654,3,josefalcon,31/07/2022,"Very clean area, well located plots, the best thing that the pool has, then it is a little far from the beach, about 15 minutes by car and a lot of mosquitoes. clean bathrooms showers 1 € 5 minutes, super helpful people and everything very clean we will return in winter to see if there are less mosquitoes"
89819,2144193,3,EvaLuna77,30/07/2022,"We paid for two nights and stayed one. We didn't like it too much. A guy with a glass glass looking for a fight in the pool, broke the glass right there because the children bothered him. Bathrooms with a lot of queues, for a fee and with the bucket outside so that you can wash it yourself when you leave with the same mop and dirty water. We were bitten by mosquitoes of all kinds, it was impossible to be outside, no repellent or anything."
89819,2129479,4,beadeckler,27/07/2022,We stayed for 1 night and were pretty happy. The kids loved the pool area. Everything was clean and the parking spaces bigger than average. 4 stars because you have to pay extra for the showers even if you only want a cold one.
89819,2127376,2,XQlero,26/07/2022,"We have camped here several times, each year it is more expensive, and offers less. At first, the man was at the reception all day, and sleeping alone in his AC, his family in a house, far away. super humble. Today he is not even here, everything charges you, and on top of that with a lack of cleanliness... What a shame."
89819,2108757,5,dosyk,22/07/2022,"Quiet and relaxing place, the management very helpful and friendly, we stayed for one night but we stayed there for two."

89819,2078247,5,trotaglamys,15/07/2022,"Ideal place, close by bicycle to many places. We stayed 5 days with children and had a great time. Great deal, Antonio a great guy. We will return if we pass through there for sure, and of course we will recommend it. Keep going!"
89819,2076661,2,calavantop,15/07/2022,"At the moment they do not charge for breathing, but for everything else, shower, pool, etc. Bearing in mind that 18 euros for what they offer is not cheap, electricity aside, it seems to me that charging even for a cold shower is excessive."
89819,2073220,4,Katmandhu,14/07/2022,Good place for a couple of nights. Shade trees are missing because it is very hot in summer. Toilets and showers are too small.
89819,2052982,5,waterparties,09/07/2022,"Very curious caravanning area, well maintained and attended. The pool is not very big, but very nice to cool off. Staff of 10. Regarding prices, nothing that is not announced in advance. We would return without hesitation."

89819,2002918,4,sors,23/06/2022,"Quiet location with a beautiful view, swimming pool and pétanque court. All the services are payable (supplement for with the view, toilets, showers, emptying etc…) be careful if you only stay 1 night they charge 2 euros (no worries for us but we would have liked to be informed of this detail) correct reception bike available for 6€ per half day. Close to the salt ponds, pleasant by bike."
89819,1994568,5,Danielrdguez,20/06/2022,"The area of 10, super clean and very friendly staff. It is far from the beach but it is compensated by the pool, especially the children had a great time. We will definitely return!"

89819,1972200,5,cevamedina,13/06/2022,"Excellent place! all very neat, one of the only ones we have seen with a sink. Close to Isla Cristina where there is a beautiful beach to stop the Motorhome in a forest environment."
89819,1929694,5,amilpin080,29/05/2022,"An oasis in Huelva. It has just been awarded as ""best motorhome area 2022"". This weekend has been very quiet, and we have been able to enjoy its facilities almost for the small group of friends that we were going. The owners are some more friends there, Along with the staff (Cristina and Goreti) who make you feel at home. With children it is a 100% successful plan. A weekend to remember. Thank you and congratulations!"
89819,1927493,3,reschima,29/05/2022,"Beautiful, very well-kept pitch with a wonderful view over the wetland. Everything is available that you need, including bike rental and bread service. Sanitary facilities are very clean, but very, very narrow. Costs: for a mobile home and two people 17 €, shower and pool use have to be paid extra. Hence the point deductions."
89819,1911314,4,Barcobird,23/05/2022,"Excellent motorhome park with large flat spaces on gravel. Service area is immaculate with everything you need. Nice views over the salt marshes.

89819,1848774,4,maixu,23/04/2022,"Good area with pool and all services. Showers one euro. It is not near the center, there is a half hour walk. We took the motorhome to the center to visit the town and parked in a dirt parking lot without any problem."
89819,1841343,1,motorhomecanaria,20/04/2022,"We went to this place with very high expectations for the same description that is given of it, in reality from the parking it is not that it has many views and the prices are not published, they charge you an additional €2 if you stay one night and you have to pay for the shower and the pool. For the shower 1 coin 5 minutes and the very small bathrooms for the 70 parking spaces they have, camping price"
89819,1840423,5,retired,20/04/2022,"After 6 weeks stay I still feel at home. Goretti, Cristina and Fran are good hosts. I don't normally stay in one location for that long. Caravanspace's comment is incomprehensible to me. Clean pool with lawn and Pentancaplatz very well maintained. At Easter the place was full but not particularly noisy. I'll be back for sure."
89819,1839012,5,EricVictor,19/04/2022,"I want to congratulate and thank the two receptionists, for always being so kind and helpful in everything we could need during our stay. And from the owner, Fran, just thanks for being there when needed. We had the bad luck that one of our dogs became a nurse at 11 pm and FRAN quickly found us an ER vet. THANK YOU SO MUCH."

89819,1825672,1,Caravanespace,15/04/2022,The shell fell off. boss never here. Places unkempt. Illegal motorcycle racing on the nature trail in front of the square. Dog feces already at the entrance. Mobile homes are also standing in the dirt on the meadow next door. Dogs roam free. Unfortunately lost the place. Reception only manned by the hour. Power failure all night and was charged. Pity!
89819,1821973,4,klr40,14/04/2022,"Just for information the basic price is now 18€ plus 2€ if you only stay one night, electricity 4€. It is not possible to reserve pitches. Our chair was set aside. Recommendation: It is best to come when the reception is open, then you have a safe place and can do something. Pitch at this time almost completely full. Places very small. Well-maintained facility."
89819,1821720,5,crigbee1,14/04/2022,"Great place to stop with good views down to the flamingos. Unfortunately it poured with rain whilst we were here, so we were only able to go for a short walk."

89819,1807351,4,Regenfrei,05/04/2022,"Nice view, pitches big enough, gravel which is very good in the rain. All clean. Very fast internet. A star deduction for not necessarily clear price structure. I just paid €18 for a mobile home in the third row, two people and electricity.? Looks like there's a 2€ surcharge if you only stay one night. Otherwise all positive."

No lighting on the way to get there. Low-cost gas station next door"
89819,1769862,5,MariaGoncalves,01/03/2022,"The area has very good conditions, the service is provided by a very friendly and attentive lady. The pool despite being winter is very well provided. In our opinion, the area is superior to many campsites and the price is very comfortable. The landscape where the area is located is beautiful, there are many flamingos, salt pans, etc. and above all, it offers tranquility."
89819,1755266,5,Huspy,13/02/2022,"We have now visited the Camperpark Playas de Luz for the second time for several weeks and can only say that we are enthusiastic about the facility and the assistants Goretti and Cristina. The two find a solution for every problem, are always approachable and friendly at all times. We will be back!"
89819,1746867,3,SkippyAU,03/02/2022,"Just pulled in as we were passing by and it’s full, no more space. The manager offered us a spot without electricity but we decided to move on. Very nice manager but the place is packed."

New clean and well kept facilities, super friendly staff but unfortunately some guests are really annoying… especially if they start talking loudly outside and if they go back and forth with the quad. We would have been more but the rude people made us run away."

89819,1684357,4,sunlayandido,10/11/2021,"We stayed 5 days, € 10 plus € 3.5 (6A) all very well, the only thing that only has two bathrooms and two small showers per gender and that cost € 1. In addition, they allow you to enter closed common places without a mask."

Very clean, beautiful swimming pool, very good sanitary and drains. We paid € 20 for 2 nights without electricity. Compared to the previous comment why not have asked the reception by paying the day before departure how to proceed rather than criticizing once left behind a screen"
89819,1661700,0,fcruzmora,25/10/2021,"Dear Rémy66; Upon arrival, you receive a document indicating a telephone number for emergencies and the door opens without problem. It is important to respect the rest of the rest of the users, so the door opens at 9 a.m. If you had another need, you could have communicated it to reception to find a solution. Cheers."
89819,1661597,3,remy66,25/10/2021,Agree with previous opinions except that .... impossible to leave before 9 am because the gate is closed for the night and you have to wait for the arrival of the manager! Not cool when you want to leave early and not very safe if you have a problem in the middle of the night.
89819,1658465,5,yemima,23/10/2021,Great place for a day or a week. I would love to come back for a few days.

89819,1656074,0,fcruzmora,21/10/2021,"Overnight area with large pitches where it is allowed to take out an awning, table and chairs. The following comment is wrong."
89819,1636385,5,Machelina,10/10/2021,"Remember that it is a PARKING, so please do not take out your tables, chairs, and other items, you have a Camping 500 meters away for it. Let's keep one of the few spaces where they let us spend the night."
89819,1631665,3,cali04,07/10/2021,"An ac area with a camping price without actually being one. The seats are good, the loading and unloading is very good but the bathrooms are very small, so much so that you come out with a flat nose. Showers are charged, € 1 5 minutes. The location is very quiet although you have the town somewhat far away, about 3km along a bike path."
89819,1631257,5,malcon,07/10/2021,"A great place, I have been a couple of nights and very quiet near Isla Cristina and 13km from Ayamonte, the staff are very nice and everything is very clean."
89819,1619424,2,laurea,01/10/2021,Very well equipped area. Everything you need for us. The reason for my low rating is a detail about the price that I had not read in any previous comment. The 2020 price was € 10 plus 3.50 for electricity. This year € 13 plus 3.50 electricity and EYE to detail: € 2 SUPPLEMENT if you only stay one night. Success has simply gone to their heads.
89819,1616537,5,philnacc,29/09/2021,"Even if Isla Cristina is not a great place, we really liked this area with its magnificent swimming pool and all the services for 16 EUR / day.

89819,1579096,5,JuliaLiAr,14/09/2021,"The area is very good, especially for cycling routes (7km to Ayamonte). To put a but, it is far from the beach, and the bike path does not reach there, in fact it is not advisable to cycle to the beach, there is a lot of traffic and there is no sidewalk either in a section. better to go by motorhome to the beach of the hole or to the blue house, which can be parked without problem."

89819,1473719,4,sorayaoli,17/08/2021,"This very good cool pool, warm bread and croissant in the morning, large plot and you can take out whatever you want on the street, they let you train in the pool in the morning and I don't give it 5 stars because the bathrooms when you go to pee you hit the head in the door a little small but the shower 1 € 5 minutes you can shower well not on the run and half. I'll be back for sure and they have mini super"
89819,1469979,5,trufayada,17/08/2021,Very cozy place..I loved the area and the super hardworking owners are always attentive to everything. Thank you Fran and Rocío for making us feel at home..we will return without a doubt...
89819,1466483,5,N110,16/08/2021,Good and welcoming.
89819,1452734,3,keizpetan,13/08/2021,It is an area with all the services. But there are too many plots to be a Camper area. It looks like a campsite. Caravans on the plots ...
89819,1452314,4,veggielore,13/08/2021,"Overall fine, the location fails and there are a lot of mosquitoes."
89819,1443679,4,raquelcri,12/08/2021,Recommended area. Small pool where you can cool off. It is necessary to use a vehicle or bicycle to go to the town and the beach. Clean facilities and very friendly staff
89819,1440527,5,Dianasp,11/08/2021,"Very good. Very attentive staff, the place was clean and the facilities as well. The only drawback is that it only has 4 points to connect to the light."
89819,1437009,4,tripax,10/08/2021,"The area is very good, with showers, washing machine, electricity and swimming pool. It is an almost perfect area, but it looks more like a campground. You are going to rest and disconnect a bit and in the pool you will find yourself with a racket of children. They are children who go every weekend with their parents with the caravan and they already form small groups. It's what we liked the least. Otherwise very good and the owners very nice"
89819,1408699,5,noni_vero,05/08/2021,Area with an outdoor pool perfect for spending the night with good facilities and good treatment. Fully recommended. It's one of the best areas I've been to.

89819,1385790,5,franjaraiz,31/07/2021,"New area, very clean, has a small pool and play area, all new, shower € 1 = 5 minutes with hot water. With a small beach bar to have a drink. When the trees grow there will be more shade, everything is new. The reception service is unbeatable, with basic necessities and fresh bread and croissants. Highly recommended. We will come back."
89819,1382710,5,Mingui13,30/07/2021,"Perfect place to spend the night and spend a few days. It has a lot of services such as swimming pool, small shop at the reception, bike rental, foodTruck. The pitches are spacious with beautiful sunsets and views of the salt flats. In the morning they make croissants on request. The bathrooms are clean, they have one for families that is great."
89819,1374043,5,amaiagg,28/07/2021,"Very quiet area away from the center. Spacious pitches, clean bathrooms and showers, the perfect pool for a dip. Views of the marshes where there are many flamingos. Fresh bread and croissant in the morning."

89819,1347861,5,vivoforta,21/07/2021,We went there to empty our grey and black waters and fill our water tank. very good and clean installation. We payed 5€ for the service.
89819,1337526,4,IagoLopez,18/07/2021,"The area is very very good, new and clean facilities. The pool is very good, there is a food truck with great hamburgers, although it is also temporary. The downside that I get is that it is quite far from the town and it is inconceivable to walk if you go with children there is at least 20 minutes walk through the salt flats, the walk is beautiful but long. the greenway leaves much to be desired."
89819,1334776,4,nachipi,18/07/2021,"Good area, the small pool and with a lot of noise. Away from the beach, they should request a good bike path that connects it. With children a bit confusing the way."
89819,1324108,5,familiafeos,14/07/2021,"Super recommended! very friendly, everything super clean and quiet! there is a nice pool that is greatly appreciated! The manager recommended places to us which he was right, very helpful! thanks for sites like this!"
89819,1316762,2,pacoj.,12/07/2021,"Quite wide area, great pitches and quiet at night, the manager a charming person, helpful to the maximum. But nowhere does it say that there are 5 km to the nearest beach and that is an inconvenience."
89819,1313934,5,camperptv,11/07/2021,"A joy of place. Large pitches, quiet and silent area. Views of the marshes. Showers 5min / € 1 It has a great pool. € 16.5 with light."
89819,1300754,4,ToInfinityAndBeyond,06/07/2021,"Good motorhome park. Missing some shade, apart from that everything was good. There's even a small swimming pool.
There's an extra of 2 euros if you stay just one night, after that the price for night without electricity is 13 euros.
Easy to cycle to the beach."
89819,1293808,4,bikefire,03/07/2021,"The Area meets everything you need for a day and night stay. There are no noises from the area, just some motorcycles that pass in the morning but at night you can rest without problem. There is a swimming pool but it is advisable to go to the beach, park for € 1 and spend the day. Keep in mind that entry time to the area is until 23:00. For more information visit the web."
89819,1289837,4,Adrian105,01/07/2021,"We spent one night with camper, 2 adults and two children, € 13 + € 2 (supplement for only one night) without electricity and separate shower for € 1 5 minutes of water. Great family care. Swimming pool with hammock area and umbrellas expands for games with children. Closed from 23:00 for vehicle access facilitates rest."
89819,1285882,5,JYE19,29/06/2021,"A great area. Very nice staff. It has good views of the marshes. The only downside is that it has little shade. Large plots. The toilets a little small, very clean. Totally recommendable."
89819,1285512,3,jaimemsb,29/06/2021,"Very good area, very friendly staff. I do not give it the 5 stars because it is located far from the urban center and far from the beaches."

89819,1273190,5,McLouis535G,23/06/2021,"Excellent motorhome area. Very good services, everything very clean and fantastically cared for. The pool area provides a very important plus. Super helpful and friendly staff. Second year and we will be back. A single ""but"" that does not depend directly on the area: the dirt in the town! Lots of trash! It draws attention."
89819,1267060,5,WolfgangBreitschuh,20/06/2021,"Clean, large parking space. We were able to exchange an empty, gray 11kg propane gas bottle for a full one. There is a small but well-stocked shop for camping accessories. Great natural landscape with many species of birds and a gas station ""next door"". Small pool on the premises."
89819,1249392,5,Marcosfd80,11/06/2021,"We have been on vacation for 15 days and we have not found any area with these services, electricity, water, showers x 1 euro 5 min, luxury pool, laundry and sinks with hot water, private transport to the beach and super clean bathrooms, you have to bring your toilet paper but with the Covid it is better. Fresh croissant and bread every day. Thank you Fran and Cristina for these unforgettable days ...."

89819,1236031,3,tamihami,04/06/2021,"Quite pricey compared to other motorhome pitches for what you get. We also had to pay a supplement of 2 euros because we only stayed 1 night. You have to add 1 euro pp for the shower. No toilet paper. Well clean. There is also a swimming pool, we did not use it but it looked quite nice."
89819,1234544,5,pacoullod,03/06/2021,Very good area. Francisco very helpful and friendly. Totally recommendable.
89819,1227360,5,Carloscalvoconde,30/05/2021,"Strategic and excellent rest area. Ideal for cycling to Ayamonte, Isla Canela and returning on the ferry to Isla Cristina. It has a swimming pool and large pitches. Two excursions that leave from reception, by barge through the marshes with a tasting of prawns and wine and another in Tuk Tuk to see the salt flats, marshes and estuaries. Both tours led by young enthusiasts. Cristina at reception a ten for her friendliness and efficiency."
89819,1201435,5,ClaudioMartinMena,16/05/2021,"Perfect overnight area. Cristina and Fran are great. They make everything easy for you. Very clean and complete facilities (showers, laundries, drains, etc). With a pool, a shop for forgetfulness, we have everything you need to have a great vacation."
89819,1189826,3,margo1965,09/05/2021,"Very good area but expensive, in May it is already high season and one day 2 people in a motorhome with electricity, € 18 (they add a supplement, a single day of € 2). It is a pass of expensive. It does not include a swimming pool or showers free."
89819,1186265,5,domingosev,05/05/2021,"A place with a lot of charm, and also with a very beautiful and well-kept pool, without a doubt a highly recommended place, the charming staff"
89819,1184525,5,TattooedVanlife,03/05/2021,"Have just supplied / disposed of here. The gate was open, but the reception was closed. Then it works with a trust fund (mailbox) at the supply / disposal. Empty the toilet, drain the waste water and fill up with drinking water for € 5. Seems new and everything was very clean and tidy! The pool looked very inviting! Will probably come back ☺️"
89819,1184038,5,Corriente,02/05/2021,"Very good area all perfect, very familiar and if you like mountain biking you can take the greenway that passes a few meters. the owner very helpful and friendly and the maid as well. new services and leveled pitches. the pool and its well-kept area. We will return 100% assured."
89819,1178274,4,nofrills,23/04/2021,"Good parking space with everything you need. The environment is fine for a couple of days. The beach is far away, the pool probably costs extra. Otherwise the operator is friendly and hard-working."

89819,1137408,5,oslo2020,14/02/2021,"Beautiful area on a little height facing the marshes, natural park. Very clean toilet block, welcoming and helpful owner.

89819,1099480,5,hansi_mueller,20/10/2020,An oasis in front of the Portuguese border. the staff is absolutely top class. Very well equipped parking space. Great disposal and supply. It doesn't get any better. We have hardly found anything comparable around here. Many in Spain can take this as an example.
89819,1099306,4,gasgas34,19/10/2020,We recommend. very clean in every way. good welcome. beautiful view of the ponds and salt flats.

89819,1072449,5,retired,27/09/2020,"One of the best places, friendly staff, all facilities in very good condition. Bread roll service and a small shop. Pool and petanca zone very well maintained. Unobstructed view to the east, south and west. Tip for a longer stay."

89819,1046771,5,casan10,13/09/2020,A true wonder. the area is great and is ideal to move around the area and base there. All services very well and super clean. the staff super friendly and the girl at the reception a charming person and very professional.

89819,1038803,4,AraleNoriMakina,10/09/2020,"The best. - The situation to visit the area, WIFI, swimming pool, spacious pitches, friendly staff, price. The worst / or improvable. - The scarce and small services that if always clean, and the almost non-existent shade (the trees are small) Totally recommended place, I do not understand the people who complain about the price, they should have given them the ALL INCLUSIVE bracelet when they bought the car / camper ."
89819,1035112,4,fran_free,08/09/2020,"Extraordinary, second time we repeat, this year with a very well cared for pool. As someone else says, I don't give it 5 stars for the little trees that are shady."
89819,1033469,4,jan28850,07/09/2020,"Correct plots, clean services, the sewage drainage area designed and as they should all be. I do not give it 5 stars because it does not have a single shade / tree to shelter you."
89819,1030359,5,Toyotomi,06/09/2020,"Area in perfect condition, very nice employee who has made it easier for us to cover our needs. Only one downside, that it is not closer to the beach and that the trees still do not provide shade. But you can't ask for more from an area, its price in line with its services and facilities."
89819,1028684,5,jomiorma,06/09/2020,"Nice employees, good price. 13 euros: overnight, 2 adults and 2 children. 3.50 euros: electricity. Super good deal, whoever complains about the price has no logic, to go to a campsite."

89819,1027068,5,amilpin080,05/09/2020,"Very quiet despite being almost full The pool area is beautiful The services are outstanding Good price, € 13 two adults and two children / night with pool, any campsite is now € 40 / night for the same VIP area . Greenway at the door, with a bike path to Isla, where you can eat very well (I recommend ""La Sal"") Ah, very nice staff and attentive to their customers."
89819,1026937,1,Soniapch,05/09/2020,"The services are very good (water, gray, chemicals, garbage ..). But there is a lot of noise from people all day and night (it looks like a fair). Being private, they should take action. You pay, so you want to rest and have privacy. For older people, the outside environment around the area and access road must be cleaned, it is very dirty (plastics, papers, bottles ...) and a ""good area"" has to be all together !!!"
89819,1021929,2,lopezluquea,02/09/2020,"I don't know so many stars in the comments? Surely they are of those who stay late into the night, drinking and screaming, without respecting the rules, high price for what is, or should be, an area. The pool is not doing well with the treatment plant, perhaps a little maintenance would improve its appearance."
89819,1019893,5,franescalante,01/09/2020,Excellent area. All services available and economical. Close to the town and unique views. Very pleasant environment.
89819,1018719,2,jerovega7,01/09/2020,"Area, Camping, Area? It was born wanting to be an Area and evolved into Camping. High rate, for what it is, motorhome and two adults € 15. The rest time is not respected, poor Wi-Fi signal. When a few minutes away is Vila Real de Sto. Antonio, with € 5 fee."
89819,1017980,5,Urko,31/08/2020,The area is now operational again after the expansion works.
89819,1017427,5,nurisnuris,31/08/2020,"A pleasant place to spend a day or more. The trees are still small and there is no shade, when they grow it will be a spectacular area. The pool is very well maintained, as is the sun loungers and children's play area. The WiFi has worked without a hitch, and we've ordered some amazing breakfast croissants. In short, we have been in glory and we will repeat for sure."
89819,1013302,5,chrisda14,29/08/2020,"Good, well-kept and pleasant place with a small shop and pay showers. All services and good atmosphere. With pool"
89819,1013003,5,RaulMarilo,29/08/2020,Small and cozy. very economical. very friendly staff. Small pool but it's okay. close a ⛽ with all kinds of articles. small shop to get out of trouble. highly recommended. right now small trees since they have been 2 years. the two girls and the owners are lovely. 100% recommendable.
89819,1010214,5,tibu77,28/08/2020,"Very quiet and with a pool, unbeatable treatment."
89819,1008327,5,Cristinapc,27/08/2020,"The site very well, and the attention of the owners excellent. they care a lot because everything is perfect."
89819,1008208,1,martincr,27/08/2020,"They are not € 13, if you are passing through they are € 15, without electricity, because they charge a supplement if you stay just one day. Wi-Fi is weak and showers have a queue despite being paid. If you want to have a campsite, set up a campsite ... If you are passing through it is not a recommended place because of its value for money. I am surprised by the positive comments for what is supposed to be a traveling tourism."
89819,1002548,5,Adolfovieco,25/08/2020,"Spectacular area and spectacular attention. I'm amazed at the comments I've seen complaining about the price. € 13 per night in the middle of August and in Islacristina, with a pool and all services. They find it expensive € 1 per 5-minute shower, to shower in their motorhome. It seems correct to me. Water is a rare commodity"
89819,1000352,4,villamalea,25/08/2020,"For the site, great, I loved it, cleanliness, services, a whole 10, the problem I see are the dogs, barking every night, and one particularly dying, impossible to sleep, they should emphasize that problem, otherwise, like i said, very good"
89819,989563,5,Natalaia,21/08/2020,"A 10 for this area, spacious pitches, with sinks, toilets and showers € 1 5 minutes. with a very cute pool. You have the possibility of light. The only downside is that it is a bit far from the town but you can go by bike or by bus. 100% recommended to rest for a couple of days."
89819,988860,4,kilibf,21/08/2020,Very good place to stay for a couple of nights. Everything is very new and very clean. The only but is that sometimes they serve very sharp and for everything they charge you an extra. We spent three nights and we all had noises of children and families until late. It is not ideal to rest but to stop for a couple of days.
89819,984667,5,lolaran,20/08/2020,"We have only used our AC to empty and fill it with water, but it seemed like a very clean and well-maintained area."
89819,979242,5,autocaravir,18/08/2020,"One of the best areas I have been to. Very clean, with all services and with a swimming pool. You can walk to the town which is 2.5km away and there are bike routes as well."
89819,975279,2,JjMarquez,17/08/2020,"Quite expensive, 15 euros just one night without electricity or showers which you have to pay separately. For how small it is, without being in a particularly privileged environment, with a swimming pool with a capacity of 15 people (very small) and for an Area it is almost a camping price. You have to reserve to be able to take a plot, in short, it is appreciated that the opening of areas to the south is stimulated but for my taste expensive."
89819,975031,3,Lasolana,17/08/2020,"everything perfect, 13 euros without electricity"
89819,974453,4,laretro,17/08/2020,"€ 18.50 AC two adults with electricity, including a € 2 surcharge for staying just one night. € 1 5 minutes of hot water. Otherwise, all good."
89819,971482,5,mariajofntn,16/08/2020,"We have been a spectacular weekend! everything full but very quiet, everything very familiar, at 11 pm everything very calm to be able to rest and until 9 in the morning there is no noise. Clean women's restrooms, beach 10 minutes by car. The deal very good staff. recommended 100%"
89819,958155,5,elandresvk,13/08/2020,"Very complete area for € 13 a day during the summer. I agree with all the positive comments you have. The fact that it has a swimming pool means that there are many families with fixed children with caravans as if it were a campsite, especially during the weekend, a detail to take into account for those who do not like that type of environment."
89819,957616,4,cece83,13/08/2020,Quiet place with a nice view as a bonus. Clean and maintained but location not wide enough for my taste. we will come back to that.
89819,954307,5,Vlaf,12/08/2020,"Very good area to visit, with large plots and all services. The pool is always a positive point !! To repeat whenever we pass through the area."
89819,947846,5,Grk222,10/08/2020,"Excellent A / C area. Very comfortable and with Pool. Nice staff and willing to advise on tourist info. Bathrooms generally clean, but a bit tight for someone over 6ft. Disinfectant gel available in bathrooms. It has two places for emptying and filling water so we never had to wait. We will be back for sure."
89819,928717,5,beluga11,04/08/2020,"Well prepared area, we spent a quiet night, very good treatment, no heat as it was quite airy, well connected to the center, we asked for a taxi, for 7 euros he took us to the center, and then we called him again and he passed us to collect. No noise, very respectful people. To come back"
89819,928253,5,MilysCaravans,04/08/2020,"With a swimming pool, ideal for spending a few summer days without remembering the suffocating heat."
89819,915248,4,garciarosuero,31/07/2020,"comfortable and well prepared area. We spent 5 days in July. Access to Isla Cristina by bike is possible but it is true that they should improve it a lot. near a very curious saline water spa. The pool gives life. The great deal. Although there are still no shadows due to the youth of the trees, there is usually a breeze, and we have not been bad despite the heat"
89819,914366,4,madeinroadvan,31/07/2020,"Very nice and quiet place, beautiful views, unfortunately the one next door didn't stop until 01:00 and we had a little sleep."
89819,901624,2,Estersanzp,26/07/2020,"The location is nice but not very accessible to go to Isla Cristina on foot. We have been charged 2 euros for just one night. In addition, you have to pay 1 euro to shower. In July many people and many children, too much noise if you are looking for tranquility. We will not be back."
89819,897197,5,EstherMR,25/07/2020,"Very clean and comfortable, the girl at the reception very friendly."

89819,893112,4,Chemagan,23/07/2020,"The facilities are good and its location too. Some more bath would be necessary and the showers are tiny, large plots and the detail of the pool is fine now € 2 more for just one day does not seem right to me."
89819,893057,5,elsoplagaitas,23/07/2020,"We came for 3 nights and stayed one more. The facilities are good although, as other comments say, it would need some more bathroom. The pitches are spacious. The pool is appreciated on hot days. There is a very good atmosphere. Isla Cristina is a stone's throw away on a bike path. We will definitely return."
89819,892411,3,pakito75,23/07/2020,"The facilities are very good and its location too. Some more bath would be necessary, and that the rates are clearer, € 2 more for a single day they had never charged me"
89819,890424,4,peperaul,22/07/2020,"Nice and quiet place. The owners are always very attentive to everything. Very friendly workers. We have had a great week. To add a drawback, just say that you have to protect yourself from mosquitoes."
89819,889755,5,kikolopez17,22/07/2020,"A fantastic place to rest. Great facilities, even better staff and very good price per night. We will definitely return to these facilities without hesitation."
89819,888687,2,mariuca,22/07/2020,"The area is good in terms of facilities and staff attention. The location is not entirely bad, since it is at the foot of the greenway (very deteriorated and with practically no shadows) and you can go on foot or bike to Isla Cristina (on an even more deteriorated bike path with infernal traffic). There are no shadows. In July, if you are looking for tranquility, do not come full of vociferous people until late"
89819,882060,3,sylvaxontrax,19/07/2020,We went there to ask if it was possible to just pay for a shower and the answer is no: you have to stay there at the price of 13 € per night (read comments below for more information on prices). Small pool also.
89819,870115,5,Sussanna,15/07/2020,"Just perfect. Quiet location, good views. Very complete and very clean facilities. Very large seats and very easy to maneuver. We will return without a doubt."

89819,847909,2,rafaelvl,04/07/2020,"The place and facilities are very good. But management not so much. We were late because the GC kicked us off the beach. The girl who attended me was very friendly and said it was € 13 / night. In the morning they charged me € 15 because being a single night is € 2 extra, which they did not tell me upon arrival although I clearly stated that I was going for 1 night. To top it off, they charge the shower (€ 1) and above it is with cold water"
89819,838356,5,amilpin080,27/06/2020,"We come back to enjoy the pool. It was what it lacked to be perfect. Full line of caravans and motorhomes, but it does not give a feeling of crowds. It can be perfectly in the pool. Ideal to be with the children, while they enjoy in the water , you relax on the deckchairs watching them. Thank you Fran for the area you have set up for the enjoyment of everyone."
89819,815426,5,amilpin080,02/06/2020,"We have spent 5 nights again. We have known Isla Cristina, the La Sal restaurant eats great. The Isla Canela beach is spectacular and very quiet. We have met several families with children, and we have had a great time. Thanks to Fran and Rocío ( owners) for making us so comfortable. There is a spectacular pine forest nearby to run around, not only the Greenway. See you next friends!"
89819,804111,5,amilpin080,20/05/2020,"Better impossible! The facilities are perfect.The pool is finished, which will debut in June.Fran and Rocío are the owners, also with a motorhome, and they could not be more friendly and attentive. More than the owners, they are one more family here. The Greenway passes through the door, ideal for going for a walk, riding a bike, ... Isla Cristina 2kms away by bike lane. Walking without schedules. We have been better than at home"
89819,794483,4,Terryc7749,12/03/2020,Went for three days stayed for seven very well laid out site all you need to enjoy your stay at a great price. Would have given 5 stars but the disabled showers have the clothes hangers and door locking bolt set 1.8m from the floor very difficult to use also other showers and toilets a little small but all in we will be back
89819,793721,4,pajolo,10/03/2020,"Very well placed, very pleasant, clean sanitary facilities. be careful hot water is not guaranteed even if it is chargeable ..."
89819,793471,4,Bayimages,09/03/2020,"Positives. 
Very friendly and helpful staff. Good size level pitches and depending on location good views. Very clean and well kept with good services on site. Small shop selling essentials, washing/drying etc. Very reasonable rates and discount for long stays.
Negatives. 
Toilets and showers are very small. Lots of local dogs barking most of the night which for me was a massive downside. Mosquitos are a issue here because of the marshes so be aware."
89819,793051,5,benimark,09/03/2020,"Excellent site in quiet but convenient location. Good size pitches & great service facilities. Very friendly staff. Toilets a bit small but everything else very clean & tidy. Good walks, bike trails & 10min to Isla Cristina for supermarket. Good value. Highly recommend will return."
89819,787377,5,Anakin,27/02/2020,Reception girl very nice and friendly. Large and well leveled plots. Loading area convenient and good discharge. Chemical emptying of 10. It has a small sink with hand soap. Shop with the necessary at a good price. Very good views in first line. The narrow showers. It is the only drawback. Congratulations!
89819,787061,4,jacknight,26/02/2020,"I confirm all the positive comments. Now this area has no particular charm: alignment of vehicles without shade or greenery. We can not have everything. Those in the front row, like in the theater, have a breathtaking view of the marshes."
89819,783937,5,did41,21/02/2020,"Impeccable welcome, spacious pitches, grocery store with everything you need for troubleshooting, we were even able to change our French gas bottle. Really quiet and relaxing place. Nice bike and even boat trips, which we have planned tomorrow. Very reasonable rates given the services offered. 12 € / 24 h with electricity. I recommend"
89819,783812,5,ben033,21/02/2020,"Ideal for a little rest. Very welcoming, very clean, beautiful view, nice space for services. Too bad the showers are too small and in a prefab, but they are hot and with a large flow."
89819,780386,3,MiraMira13,14/02/2020,"In the evening full to the last seat. Very well-kept, friendly welcome. The two toilets or showers (1 euro) per male and female are too narrow and too little for a 1.75 cm person."
89819,779502,3,denech17,12/02/2020,"Very nice motorhome area. Well stabilized. Very friendly welcome and good service. Bread on order, gas bottles. Showers at 1 € for 5 minutes. Beautiful walks around. € 10 without electricity and € 3.50 for electricity."

89819,771793,5,VittorioB.,23/01/2020,"Nice area, well managed, very friendly welcome. Showers, toilet, loading and unloading all very clean, small food store, washing machine and dryer, restaurant nearby, possibility of cycling between the salt pans € 12 with Acsi card including electricity, otherwise 13.50. I recommend it."
89819,769362,4,RamonKTF,17/01/2020,"Very conditioned everything. I have spent two nights and despite being full, the atmosphere was of total tranquility. I advise arriving in the morning because with the closing of the reception at noon, there is an upset with the availability of plots. Those who arrive at those hours, enter and occupy plots without knowledge of the direction of the area. The Wi-Fi reaches the most remote places but with so many people connected, it is impossible to get it to work in conditions. In short, good site but should improve the organization."
89819,766767,4,ralf-ganter,09/01/2020,"Very nice, clean place. The sanitary facilities make a good impression, I didn't use drinks, snacks and bread at the reception. You need a bike to shop at Mercadona and Lidl. The Wi-Fi only works well near the reception and is unstable at the end of the square. We felt safe and comfortable and would be happy to recommend the place."
89819,765395,4,VollzeitVanlife,06/01/2020,"Very nice operator. I stood here for a few weeks in October. Simple place, but it is really suitable for a few days. Somewhat negative that the next shopping opportunity can only be reached comfortably by vehicle and the sanitary facilities are somewhat small. Otherwise great offer in terms of price / performance."
89819,763675,4,maminadia,04/01/2020,"Great place, nice view: high area, somewhat narrow plot, well received, well equipped, and good atmosphere. I will come back with pleasure."

89819,745235,4,LYP,20/11/2019,"Beautiful place, starting a beautiful bike ride to Ayamonte and Isla Cristina. Clean, super home. Remains the abnormal behavior of some who ruin the calm of the place. A camper without a dog is rare, two is common but three here who barks permanently is too much for owners and neighbors."
89819,744501,5,ManuBec,18/11/2019,"A really nice place. Toilet, shower and dishes available. Nice walks with dog possible. Isla Cristina also worth seeing. We will be back."

There is a small shop selling some groceries frozen bread and croissants, there is a small oven and microwave for you to use. Prices as above and 5 euro if you just use facilities. There is a restaurant close by with excellent reviews but sadly it was too late for us to try it before leaving. Will definately return and hope all you campervan users will respect this area."

89819,729238,5,Saruki3,24/10/2019,"A great place for bird lovers, since it is in front of the marshes and at sunset there are many herons. Friendly staff, informed us of interesting activities in the area. € 10/24 h, but the view of the marshes at sunset / sunrise is worth it, in addition to a mini park with toys and trampoline, where our kids enjoyed."
89819,723890,5,schueri,17/10/2019,Everything has already been written. Great place ... very well laid out. Sanitary rooms exemplary clean. Reception friendly and very helpful. The complete all-inclusive package will be delivered ... incl. Pizza preparation. Great ... it is not better.

89819,718574,5,JOJO17,11/10/2019,"10/10. An area as we would like to find more often. 7 days for 77 € including electricity. Very large well-defined sites. Separate men's and women's sanitary blocks, each with 2 showers, 2 WCs, 2 sinks, mirrors and power outlet, and an exemplary cleanliness. Several crockery trays and several for linen. Washing machine and dryer. Drainage space very well designed with several faces for WC cassettes. Children's play area and small grocery store. Only downside the state of the bike path to be redone next year. But the + of + it is the kindness and the very great availability of the owner, the staff and in particular of Goretty who gets in 4 to collect all the information which you need. Congratulations to all the team, do not change anything. We will definitely be back."
89819,717053,4,julilla,09/10/2019,We use the area to pour water and fill the tank. They charge 5 euros for this service. All very clean and well organized. The campsite was very clean and beautiful views

The detail of the pool is appreciated, although small is appreciated in Huelva in August. The beach is a bit far if you want to walk. The motorhome environment is very good especially for children there is a lot. For me the only one but is to close the traffic at 11"

89819,342033,4,osita,18/08/2018,"Another important thing, the site is 3.6 km from the village, walking with children, it is complicated (more than 8 km round trip). Otherwise everything very well."

The site shows that fellow travelers have mounted it, for the details and their illusion. We wish you all the best, we will return. Nearby sites with a lot of interest that Fran will explain to you enchanted. Thanks for all friends...."

89897,3219545,5,karlook,26/08/2023,Thanks to the City Council for setting up a new field next to the restaurant. Quiet night and great beach. In the restaurant very friendly and good food.
89897,3106868,5,caddydeadri,09/08/2023,"It is a quiet place to spend the night. In the summer months there are many cars and with a large AC it can be difficult to find a place, but with small vans much better. The beach is pretty and has several well-kept toilets and showers."
89897,2565045,4,slocum,31/01/2023,Beautiful location in a dead end street. Resto closes in winter (made with the castle of a boat). beach close by. no services. enough for one or two nights
89897,2402938,3,decinois,25/09/2022,"Quiet parking and very close to the beach. 4G okay. dish. wc closed (end of season?) but beach shower ok. we spent one night there, sheltered from the wind and very calm."
89897,2382083,5,joellejunker,18/09/2022,quiet parking lot by the sea.
89897,2328821,4,Izaromaren,01/09/2022,"I read the last comment, and I decided not to come to eat at the barbecue and hang out on the beach, since it is bad to park the ac. Well, I've come and it's addicting, I've parked the ac at the first try, the beach bar is super good and the beach is beautiful. It is also because of the date, in July and August it is probably more crowded."
89897,2201080,3,Morles,09/08/2022,"There are no spaces for motorhomes... it is a small car park where you can enter with L1H1 type vans... any larger vehicle will stick out and bother you except at night when the car park is empty. My rating is 3 for that reason... That said, the beach is very nice, with toilets, showers, tables and a good txiringuito!!!"
89897,2159106,4,C.rico,01/08/2022,A flat and very quiet car park giving access to a superb little beach. Beach shower and toilets. A restaurant opposite open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Perfect for one night.
89897,2153975,5,xalocgregal,31/07/2022,"Nice location to spend the day and overnight, very quiet, with public shower and bathroom services. A beach bar and some houses around it, perfect to go with children. Nearby the Cueva de la Doncella and the Focico de Porco."
89897,2071968,5,castrexa,14/07/2022,"Perfect and quiet parking at night, barbecue bar for a drink or eat (they don't give dinners) booth with bathrooms and booth with showers that close at 8:30-9:00 p.m. but the outdoor showers continue to work, it has a picnic area. Xilloi beach, beautiful to spend the day. For large caravans, the spaces are small and would hinder the passage but perfect for vans."
89897,1585763,3,Sara_Zoty,17/09/2021,"Level parking, somewhat small, our 6m calmper stuck out. Although we were alone all night (09/16). Beautiful beach, without people. Very calm."
89897,1495553,4,cuyaya,22/08/2021,"The place is beautiful, in my opinion the most beautiful and comfortable beach I have visited in the entire Cantabrian Sea. I don't give it 5 stars because it is not very practical for vehicles larger than a camper. If there is no space in the parking lot, there is a field plot set up as a parking lot about 400 meters from the town road valid for large ACs but I don't think you can spend the night."
89897,1476824,4,75849663L,18/08/2021,"Good site. It has tables and fountains, and beach showers open all night. The bathrooms are quite dirty and when we were there they closed them around 10 at night."
89897,1463894,4,setegarcia3,16/08/2021,"Good parking and very quiet. It is difficult to find a place in summer but at night there is almost no one. We were 5 vans and about 4/5 AC. In front a bar / restaurant (recommended to reserve). Picnic areas in the area with light. Bathrooms and showers do not open until 9.30 just when they are cleaned, closed at night. beach shower always running. dogs only from 9pm to 10am on the beach."
89897,1424234,3,xrius,08/08/2021,"It is a small parking lot. Large ACs do not enter because they would cut off the path. The good thing is that it is a short walk from the beach, has picnic tables, barbecues, bathrooms and beach showers. There is a beach bar next door. Google Maps makes a mistake when entering because it enters against the direction, you have to go around the top"
89897,1417280,3,Armando1,07/08/2021,"Good parking, fountain, toilets, showers, tables and operational barbecues. A bit noisy, especially when the beach bar closes, which by the way is nothing special."
89897,1343782,3,Tinou44,20/07/2021,"It is only a simple car park which just has the advantage of being close to the beach. In this season, the parking lot is completely filled with cars. It's probably better in the evening after the cars have left, but I didn't stay there. Otherwise the beach is really very pretty."
89897,962673,4,Orome111,14/08/2020,"Be careful to come on good sunny days, there are no places and going down to the beach you can get confined if you go with a large AC. After 20:00 it is perfect, you can have dinner at the Los Arboles picnic area and stay the night in a privileged place."
89897,958694,1,asant91,13/08/2020,"Quiet place, not very windy. It is next to the beach, with tables nearby. There are bathrooms but they close them at night, and they didn't open them in the morning, perhaps because it was raining."
89897,645926,4,Fandi72,20/08/2019,"The site is very cool but with the inadequate aptitude of some (motorhome to call them something) soon they will cut, today a car with motor carrier included cutting the circulation in front of the beach bar and for more fucking making a paellita in the middle of the street, postures so we benefit little"
89897,631955,4,jfueyo3,15/08/2019,In the next street that gives more focus to the beach you can also sleep and quieter
89897,407388,5,jakbel,14/11/2018,2 days spent on this site. great place to rest

89956,2338259,3,al1406,04/09/2022,"Located between the cemetery and the children's park. Once the last children left (11:30 p.m.), it was the young people who disembarked in 3 cars with loud music and of course when all the parking spaces were available, they come to park next to you. Tranquility returned around 1:30 a.m."
89956,1791008,1,sciroco,21/03/2022,"Following the passage of several young people, we preferred to leave the place and go to another parking lot."
89956,1774527,5,CagouilleExpress,05/03/2022,"Next to a park for children and 10 minutes walk from the center. We didn't spend the night there, but we left the campsite for the time to visit the city. No problem."
89956,1753961,4,torcivan,12/02/2022,We stayed 1 night and it was a quiet place. In the late afternoon some teenagers and children in the park but at night not a noise. Park with many fun swings for the little ones and not so little ones.
89956,1634018,1,ijkimber,09/10/2021,Had the potential to be a nice quiet place. But it gets overtaken with teenagers. Definitely not a good place to spend the night.
89956,759678,4,Patri81,30/12/2019,We have spent two nights and in general well although one of them a group of young people was in the park giving voices while they were pulling the zip lines. It is the cemetery parking lot. Walking 10 minutes you reach the city center. The park is great for children of all ages.
89956,686603,4,chisca,11/09/2019,"Well there are no services, but to rest and continue perfect and quiet trip !! Thanks C REAL!"
89956,435959,4,Relizard,03/03/2019,"Great if you go with children. Quiet night Close to the citizenship, it is worth seeing the Quijote museum."
89956,428041,4,sciroco,10/02/2019,Very good to spend the night. The play area just opposite is empty at the end of the afternoon. No problem of access
89956,421771,4,rafaydana,11/01/2019,"Quiet, level and asphalted parking. Next to playground and cemetery. Little noisy during the night. Without services."
89956,383302,5,CL33,27/09/2018,Address particularly inaccurate. it is a small street not wide. You have to go to the other side of the roundabout and follow Cimetiero. And the cemetery is from this great park very nice.
89959,3159064,5,glow22,16/08/2023,"Super place in front of the sea with views of the mountain, with a special smell of eucalyptus, very quiet and recommended"
89959,3086863,5,MTM25,06/08/2023,"Superb location, we were only 4 vans. A few steps from the beach for a morning swim. Nearby a restaurant bar, so a little noisy when customers leave but largely surmountable. A shower at the beach."
89959,3031421,5,Newsoul,27/07/2023,"We were alone in the parking lot (July 6) with a magnificent view of the beach, which is a 7min walk away (good slope). Very nice beach."
89959,2888963,4,mattshop,25/06/2023,Only a couple spots for large campers in the back. You will quickly get blocked in by cars so plan to stay well into the evening. Close to the beach and nice views.
89959,2745625,1,StephieA,13/05/2023,No parking for heavy vehicles. There are signs everywhere with an axle limit of 6 tons.
89959,2721624,5,pafranck,04/05/2023,"Superb car park, very quiet with a superb view. We were 2 van and 1 camper in this season. The beach below is easily accessible."
89959,2550627,5,jules58537,13/01/2023,"The view from the parking lot is great! Beautiful sandy beach surrounded by cliffs. Place is quiet in this season (we are alone in the parking lot) just a few locals on foot who walk their dogs. Parking quite easy to access, be careful in the turns because the road is still not very wide. The car park is a little sloping but some places less than others, with the wedges it's perfect. Sanitary facilities down towards the beach (not used by us)"
89959,2112081,4,jjlazo79,23/07/2022,Great views of the Ñora beach. We spent a night right at the entrance anticipating the number of cars that would arrive after 10am so as not to get locked up. On the descent to the beach there is a source of drinking water that we take advantage of to fill bottles and jugs. Very fair mobile coverage for teleworking.
89959,1724439,4,LillebuLea,03/01/2022,"Very, very nice place, there seems to be residents, the place is a bit crooked in some places but overall you have a great view and it's quiet."

89959,1541461,2,RebecaArellano,02/09/2021,Site where everyone relieves themselves. We didn't like it at all. We recommend it only to park and go to the beach. We spent the night because we were late.
89959,1512130,3,GoldenTalento,25/08/2021,We have slept several campers and AC. a little slope. From 9: 30-10: 00 people start to arrive to go to the beach and some with bad faces. Magnificent views.
89959,1502972,3,ivanpinzales,23/08/2021,"At the moment there is no sign forbidding to park or spend the night motorhomes. In Asturias, motorhomes near the coast and outside the established car parks are not welcome. The parking lot is small for motorhomes with the number of cars that flock to the beach daily. I would recommend the previous parking above with the details said regarding parking and overnight"
89959,1476813,4,75849663L,18/08/2021,"Very nice site. We spent one night together with 3 or 4 other ACs and all very quiet. The ground is a bit uneven and there is no fountain, although there is a shower and fountain on the beach."

89959,1388538,5,lelefvt,01/08/2021,"Great spot to spend a quiet night with the sound of the waves !! Two parking spaces available with a breathtaking view. Currently very few people, especially at night. No services available in the car parks."
89959,1247896,4,krusa,11/06/2021,Good to stay overnight. There is water at the beach. There are even larger parking spaces further up.
89959,991694,2,delphetnico,22/08/2020,Very nice beach. The problem is coming and going late at night and early in the morning. Really not easy.

89959,919851,5,loslupins,02/08/2020,"I corroborate the previous comment. Quiet night, we were two cars, a van and a caravan. Good place to spend the night. We didn't try the restaurant, but it seemed like an ideal sunset spot. We go up the stairs too :) and on the beach it is not allowed to go down with a dog."
89959,918278,5,flosticks,01/08/2020,"A spectacular place, very quiet to sleep although during the day it is full of beach cars ... By the way, I highly recommend you have a drink or dinner (it is expensive, yes) at Mare Salata to see the sunset: IN CRE I BLE !!! Now you can go up to the viewpoint on the other side of the beach: the views are amazing, it's worth every step!"
89959,849545,4,JuanjoAlbala,05/07/2020,"A beautiful and quiet place at night listening to the sea, but throughout the day full of people who go to the beach. Only valid for overnight"
89959,725233,1,zionadventures,19/10/2019,DO NOT PARK HERE! Parked here for 2 hours max in the afternoon (October 2019) and went for a walk. Came back and our van had been broken into. Drivers windows and locks completely busted with passports stolen. Needless to say we did not stay the night.
89959,527885,4,niraexploradora,25/06/2019,"We have slept in the downstairs parking lot. Beautiful place and sunset. Very quiet night, only the waves of the sea could be heard. There are places where you can put the motorhome flat. Little coverage of the mobile. recommendable"

89959,454293,2,anayrafa,14/04/2019,"No parking in the parking lot near the beach, so we went back to the large parking at the top, the place is very quiet, we slept very well, but the parking is dirty, papers, sanitary towels, and used condoms pretty much everywhere. No convenience, accessible with all types of vehicles"

89982,3134991,3,Cmurlo,13/08/2023,"It is indeed a very quiet place, but it looks like someone's farm. It is inside the Natural Park. There are few places around to spend the night, so within what there is, it's not bad. The regular arrival path, many potholes, flat but short, so no problems."
89982,394928,3,Charlotte75,17/10/2018,"We stayed here one night to do a biketour in the area, but choosed to stay closer to the paved road then the marker. We had a good night sleep, no pne passes on the dirtroad and little traffic on the road. Also left the cqr there during biking."

There was a dog barking at a distance but stopped as soon we went to sleep. in the morning there were dozens of hot air balloons floating rhrough the valley. On a hiking trail qhich takes you over a pedestrian bridge next to the river. we had a great, tranquile night/morning."

90065,353960,3,chtigaby,26/08/2018,"The place is probably nice off season but it is a crossing point of the corner walk because there is a small pedestrian bridge.

Therefore 5 stars."

Thanks"

Thank you Rose and Adriano for your recommendations and pastels de nata."

Our son was also not allowed to use the adjacent field as a ""playground"" and the farmer has been plowing the other adjacent field since 7:30 a.m. So we weren't that lucky."

90094,2171074,3,Mochileros2022,04/08/2022,Quiet place with a lot of space. The owner provided us with an extension cord for the electrical connection. It is next to the mouth of the sea and at low tide a mini beach is formed that hardly covers it (up to the knees at most). It has a gray to empty black water. The only drawback for me is that we never got hot water.

The power grid only creates 1200 watts, so our refrigerator does not get full power and often switches to gas. It's very calm and beautiful here. The size of the camper is not important, but it should not be over 7 tons, as it could sink into the ground."

You can not leave Murtosa without making a down wind through the channels. ..spectacular landscape. Oh! And if you like photography. ..Approte the sunsets and flamingos. The club also offers kayaking, paddle boards for a walk on the canals or a bike to take a walk through the cornfields. We have loved the place, it is ideal for kiting and have a relaxing vacation.

It has a water source and water emptying service."
90199,3047717,5,AdrianCotelo,30/07/2023,"Perfect for filling and emptying, but aimed at the good people of motorhomes: scrub the pots in your vehicles, not in the filling taps, thus hindering the function for which these taps are intended, thank you."

90199,2907155,2,MariadePino,30/06/2023,"motorhome service, today half full of parking for municipal use, a pity that there are vehicles that do not respect the area only intended for motorhomes, reducing the space even more. It's a shame, the park is right next door, but educate the owners so that their pets don't leave gifts in the area, keep in mind that children also have rights"
90199,2893280,4,itchyfeetfiona,26/06/2023,Surprisingly quiet for a urban site. Level too. A few places to eat around even on a Sunday! Supermarket and park and today we cycle into the city to see the sights. Thanks to the town.

It doesn't have nice views because it's in the middle of an urbanization. It was quite full when we arrived but we had a very quiet night if it weren't for the fact that early in the morning some freaks were racing the car and shouting. But at 11 they left and everything was quiet."
90199,2727618,2,Northern_Fjells,06/05/2023,Great & new supply station with fresh water and gray water disposal. Quite a hop-on hop-off (come and go) though. At two o'clock in the morning camper lists come and make noise and come or drive all night long.
90199,2698791,4,Mutley952,26/04/2023,It is as described some parking bays in a car park just off the centre of town.  There was no space to fit in the Motorhome spaces and a number were parked in the normal car park at 14.30.  Having spent all our time in rural locations it didn’t suit us and the dog would have been in the van the whole time so we left and went further afield to Pontevea and parked in a lovely spot by the river.

A few dark figures in the parking lot, but also a meeting place for many young people at the picnic areas. Didn't feel safe and wanted to sleep soundly at night. That's why I didn't spend the night there."

If you don't take the bus, (we haven't done it because it was too full and we're going with a baby, stroller, etc.)….recommendation: don't call or take the taxi from Santiago, taxi compostela, we've been scammed; ask for an invoice If you can call a taxi Milladoiro much better; at least that has been our experience today."

There are full free services excluding electricity.

The grey waste is a long grid in the ground at the entrance to the services. The ground has a slight run into the drain but only if your pipe is in the center.
The black WC drain is 500mm off the ground and on one side of the water terminal under a cover which is all stainless steel. The large drain pipe creates no splashback. There is a push button tap just above the drain to clean the cassette with weak pressure so water is kept in the cassette.
The fresh water tap is a small screw-on connection and a press button with excellent pressure. One press will give 2/3 litres.
There was some small bins in the carpark.

The town is 5 minutes up the road and down a steep hill with plenty of shops, bars and restaurants to choose from.
This town is on the Portuguese Camino route so you will see plenty of walkers passing by and it's only 7km into Santiago on a well marked route, suitable for walkers or cyclists.
We had a good night here and the road noise was no problem. 

Bugs/Mosquitoes. (They love us..)

The sanitary facilities are clean despite the high space utilization and toilet seats, toilet paper and soap are available. At night an increased background noise but you can walk to everything. Animation is available at the own bar. Was nice here."

Otherwise not to our liking, because everything was quite narrow and there were larger hotels to the left and right. But that's subjective. At this time it didn't matter. Personally, I can't imagine it in the summer. Direct access to the beach. Nice personel."

Next year, it's for repeating!"
90237,1499201,3,Laetitiamtrg,22/08/2021,"Mixed opinion. In the heart of the city but direct access to a pretty beach. We didn't take the time to see the pool. We only stayed there for one night and got divided. Places available, 78 € per night for 2 adults 3 children in high season, which we found expensive but which ultimately was not that much considering the price of other campsites. Clean sanitary facilities."

Without knowing the reason for the town hall or the concession of the beach bar (misguided this year). The place in fabulous and very busy. The area is lovely and it's a pity the mistake made this 2023."
90292,3148392,4,silviahernandez,14/08/2023,"Nice and quiet area, there is shade and you can bathe. The emptying and filling does not work, I suppose it is a thing of the council. On the other hand, the beach bar, despite the fact that its service is not the best, is cozy and you can have a drink/eat something. The bathrooms are from the beach bar and they are not very clean, so they are open during the hours that the beach bar is open. Don't dirty the area anymore, please."
90292,3051033,3,LaChatinaVan,31/07/2023,"Quiet area and next to a very relaxing river, and a good atmosphere. The access road in some points is not very good and as it passes through ""El Puente de Sanabria"" there is a fairly narrow bridge, only one vehicle passes by, be careful!! There is only one sign that also indicates that there is a water service, it is under construction. There is a very cool beach bar, managed to serve drinks and little else, zero friendliness."

The loading and unloading area has been under construction for at least a week.... who is doing the work Manolo and Benito..... Either we all report the facts to the City Council or say goodbye to this place."
90292,3031603,1,Peibolilla,27/07/2023,"We have left this wonderful place, like the rest, because the beach bar has a tower for the DJ with large speakers and they play music until 04.30/05.00 am said by the waitress, I doubt very much that music can be played there until those hours... and even if you can, it seems crazy to me in the middle of nature."

Apparently it is usual on Thursdays and Fridays. the experience has been horrible, we leave with a very bad taste in our mouths"

It seems that the van is going to overturn... and the whole area full of cars. This is no longer an area, avoid it if you can."

90292,1812670,5,akiyo,09/04/2022,"A nice and cozy place. The bar was open and with a very nice atmosphere (music, food and tables outside). The river is next. We liked feeling accompanied by so many other van campers and AC. There is nothing around except nature so very quiet. Water service, and emptying of gray and black. We didn't get to use them though. highly recommended"

90292,1800863,2,Arthropodite,30/03/2022,The drain on the floor is so clogged with dirt that the gray water cannot drain and quickly overflows. We used the black water disposal flaps which was awkward. The faucet handle is removed without any information. With the help of tongs we were able to turn on the water. It appears to be river water (slight greenish turbidity).
90292,1795033,5,millimolekuel,25/03/2022,"Very nice for one night. It's still very gray right now, but it's definitely gorgeous in summer. There was hardly a car on the street, so it was super quiet"

90292,1645357,4,KePaXeta,15/10/2021,"Shaded and flat site, grassy and dirt floor. In summer the chiringuito will work, now it is a very quiet area. It has a gray and black casting area. I suppose that in summer they will connect the tap to be able to fill water. Very quiet, with the river next to it to be able to bathe. Undefined plots but it is a wide esplanade"
90292,1639919,4,Guarrillero,11/10/2021,"At least one place where we are well received, a shame that the clean water tap is off. when we got to the beach bar it was closed. a shame that people ACAMPE, and leave garbage, park in parking lot with their friends, etc. and those things that make every day we can go to less free places."
90292,1633732,3,lgte,08/10/2021,Still no water. others have removed the handlebar from the tap so I deduce that this goes for a long time

90292,1591616,4,mamenpere,19/09/2021,Cool area but as the water does not work it is a limitation (that's why it is not five stars). I hope they repair it

In the bathroom there is a sign that says ""waters without sanitary guarantee"", so I understand that it is not drinkable."
90292,1518903,3,cagimse,27/08/2021,"The place is very beautiful, a great river to bathe, and the best beach bar to have a drink. To put some problem, we find that the water intake with which to fill the clean water tank, is used to wash the sewage tanks, since there is no differentiated outlet for this, with the consequent risk of contamination of said outlet and the tank of the vehicle to be supplied."
90292,1504686,5,Oteroj,24/08/2021,"It has been very busy all summer. The site was always a place to stop and spend the day. Being known has encouraged a lot of tourism and that the beach bar is crowded with people from AC / Camper, etc. in addition to tourism in the area. The site is perfect and beautiful, with the possibility of knowing the area of the Lake and its surroundings. I recommend it 100%."

It has undoubtedly been the best place we have spent the night (for free)"
90292,1490560,1,Pacomovil,21/08/2021,"What a pity. It could be one of the best areas in Spain. But it will end up disappearing through our own fault. People washing the motorhome on the banks of the river. People washing dishes in the services of the beach bar. People with everything set up as if they were in a campsite and the worst, people camped on the same shore of the natural pool, preventing free access to bathers. What a pity"

Relaxing sound of the river ... and with emptying of gray and black waters and filled with water. Can you ask for more? We went through the area where the water was drained, because, likewise, in the other area the road can be heard a bit, but it is not very busy ... thank you !!!!!"

90292,1447799,5,crilaia,12/08/2021,Great quiet place and with a river beach you can park perfect in sun or shade. In the afternoons in August it gets quite crowded but there is plenty of room to sleep. The only downside is that some savvy man has stolen the filler tap adapter and left the hose loose. All great if it weren't for these guys. Like the one who was washing the car
90292,1445626,3,VANNY114,12/08/2021,"Good place to visit the lake the next day. A lot of space but a bit anarchic in terms of how to occupy it. In addition, we have already visited it in August, with the terrain very beaten by the passage of cars. Good chiringuito and quiet night."
90292,1440135,4,OscarHevia,11/08/2021,"Good resting place with river beach meadow and beach bar, let's hope that the actions of the uncivilians do not close it, yesterday there was an individual washing the motorhome next to the beach area. On the other hand, the service area is correct even with two parking places. emptying the toilet, it's a shame that it only has one tap for supply and cleaning which does not make it very hygienic."
90292,1431694,5,Sagu,09/08/2021,"Great site. Access to the river, a lot of space, with and without shade. In the afternoon it fills up, with cars for a bath, and at night with motorhomes that are visiting the park.

As soon as you pass the gas station in the town of El Puente, you have to turn right where a sign indicates BARRIO DE LA GAFA. On the way back, take it just before crossing the narrow bridge, along a street that goes to the left"

The only thing that we came here looking for a place to shower because it indicates it in the description and the showers are CLOSED. Still, ideal to come with children. There is shade. I can swim in the river although the water is very cold. At the campsite in La Puebla they let you shower paying € 3 per person. Greetings"

90407,373494,4,aralc92,14/09/2018,"Great place. We were all alone. Shower, toilet and garbage bin are there and presentable."
90407,349205,5,VanAlain89,22/08/2018,"Excellent post, for little to arrive after 19h in summer because it is invaded by locals in the afternoons. After 20h, no one and magical place where we could observe the dolphins evolving 100 m from the beach. The dream."
90407,308208,5,Charly.23,31/07/2018,"A very nice place, we had a very quiet night, shower and bathroom, garbage cans if you want to spend a quiet day with your partner is advisable"

90435,3044470,5,maellerptx,30/07/2023,"A stone's throw from the beach and the motorhome area (few places so practical if it is already overloaded), beach showers and drinking water fountains. Clean public toilets but only open from 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Restaurants 2min walk."
90435,2388676,4,Guarrillero,20/09/2022,"very good place, only there are few places and the poti tap is the same as the water tap... very quiet, basic supermarket nearby"
90435,2100173,4,anjocores,20/07/2022,"Not the best place to stay. Vehicles to pass. Or in the nearby service area, or on Rua das Algas, where you cannot and should not place tables, chairs, etc. There are residents who have complained in the Municipality. No Camping."
90435,1715215,4,Travellingmacks,24/12/2021,"I don't think the site has been completely finished yet. You can empty the toilet and get water, but there is only one water tap. The coordinates are a little misleading, the site is at one end of the football pitch on the opposite side of the road to the beach. Behind the camper van sign.

90435,1692274,5,fammol,18/11/2021,"Very nice place. Quiet and so close to the beach. There is only a sign with a camper on it so it seems that even ""camping"" is allowed. Number of people had tables and chairs standing outside. In the evening there is training on the adjacent football field so that gives some noise, but that is it. We will definitely come back here!"
90435,1674884,4,Ryanna52,02/11/2021,Great location The GPS coordinates are not good and the address is incomplete: castelo de Neiva. The gray water drain is missing… otherwise I would have put 5 stars.

Unfortunately, the depicted toilet block is no longer there and the showers on the beach are also without function. Maybe because it's October already."
90435,1642592,5,paolaboscolo1,13/10/2021,"Very nice area with large spaces, facing the beach, very quiet, with all the water loading and unloading services. At the taberna da Laurinda we had lunch with the dish of the day, spending 6 euros per person"

However, we appreciated this extremely calm place. No passage in the morning. So wake up in peace and have a peaceful breakfast. The children were able to have fun on the playground (swings, etc.)."
90440,2985486,5,stepocamp,19/07/2023,"Ideal as a stopover. Unfortunately, the picnic area was closed because gardeners worked there, but there is enough space to park on the gravel, even with large campers. I can't say anything about the toilets and the cafe, they were closed. But the river is perfect for a short cool down and also very popular with the locals. Highly recommended"

In addition, the playground is hardly usable anymore and the picnic tables are getting old and unsuitable for smaller people. There was also a lot of work this weekend and the Vorderman pool and drinks kiosk will probably open again soon."
