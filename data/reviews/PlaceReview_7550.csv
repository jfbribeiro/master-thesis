102074,2327038,4,GeorgeMarsh,01/09/2022,"good site for a a smaller van. parking along San Nicolas Obveata so it's worth checking the whole street, overlooked by housing with people passing by so relatively safe. it's a quiet and well kept neighbourhood with no rubbish and the toilet on the river is  an automatic one that closes so it stays  clean and you can wash yourself in it"
102074,1828364,4,vguerra21,16/04/2022,"Quiet parking to visit later the Guggenheim museum area, 20 minutes walk."
102074,1804766,3,Erean,03/04/2022,"The parking lot is quiet, we spent the night there and nothing special to report. There are communal toilets nearby, they aren't amazing but at least they are there! Of course, you shouldn't choose the place for the view or its proximity to the city center, but it is difficult to park in Bilbao!"
102074,1758740,1,MartinMateo,18/02/2022,"My van was robbed, window broken. Thief was hidding behind different car. This happened at 21:00."
102074,1438313,3,nerinasacristan,11/08/2021,"We without problems. We read the comments and we were scared, but we went for a (long) walk to see the Guggenheim, and we returned to have dinner and sleep here. Surely if they want to rob you, Nobody finds out, better park in the area with more people. But the train is annoying if you are a light sleeper."
102074,691313,4,inesserry,15/09/2019,"Good place to spend the night! The fault is that it is next to the train tracks and, from time to time, pass and bother a little. Good access to urban transport services"
102074,679332,1,martino35,06/09/2019,"Attention, do not park here. We stood here on 04.09. for about an hour and drove with the bicycles in the city. When we came back our motorhome was broken up and stolen everything valuable, including 3 credit cards and some immaterial things for us. The police did not care much about it; is probably everyday in Bilbao!"
102074,675476,2,Pfrmpf,03/09/2019,"Place itself is near to the city centre and good to reach. When we came back from a 3 hours visit of Bilbao we realized that someone broke into our van, destroyed our door lock and tried to steal valuable stuff. This happened during the day so be careful when you park your van at this spot!"
102074,659683,4,Stjepan,25/08/2019,"Pros: it is safe to sleep, plenty of parking places, 10-15 walk to the center.

Cons: no amenities or water, parking only.

If you are sensitive to noise, be aware that train passes by."
102074,642327,3,juanracollado,19/08/2019,Good to visit the city. Nothing else. Very noisy.
102074,491212,1,manoleta,24/05/2019,"It is good if the day you spend outside, half an hour walk from downtown, the night I do not recommend the train you have it right behind and not for night and day."
102074,471662,1,Misirika,30/04/2019,"ACs Care, Google Maps sends us through a tunnel of 2.7m in height. The other alternative exit was under a bridge 2m high. We had to go back where we came from."
102074,401333,1,taum88,30/10/2018,"Isolated and very quiet place, too quiet, I found someone emptying the truck when I returned from my ride in Bilbao. Really close to the city center but at your own risk"
102074,396456,4,dianayjose,20/10/2018,Well located on the edge of the river without services. Quite a lot of parking spaces although we had to occupy 3 spaces across
102074,395725,5,edgaredgar,19/10/2018,"Very good, beware the day the car park is full so if you want to be sure of having room, plan to arrive in the evening when people are leaving Bilbao. Otherwise really nothing to say, by choosing its place we can wake up with a view overlooking the city. I have no worries about the safety of this car park, there is almost continuous rolling so difficult for a thief to be discreet. At night I do not know, avoid leaving your vehicle alone. If you make more than 6/7 meters, you can not park in battle so I think you will have to take two or three places ... about ten minutes on foot to reach a bit more active part of Bilbao (but goes below the stadium and along the docks so it's not a chore!)"
102075,522049,4,HannaKraemer96,20/06/2019,Right next to the highway. Therefore very loud but okay for one night.
102075,472803,5,Aidaia,01/05/2019,"Great parking for the day, enough space for the motorhome and with the exit next to the highway. It is 10min walking from the beach and about 30 from the port. There are not many more places to park large vehicles in Porto Banus. For the night it will be very noisy because it has the highway literally next to it. If there was no place, 50 meters later there is another similar one."
102075,430985,3,CarlyWicks,19/02/2019,Parked for the day and walked into Puerto Banus (30 min walk).
102075,427411,4,youzu1982,08/02/2019,"Parked for the day, seems alright for the night if you don't mind the noise from the motorway. Actually it's only 10 minutes walk to Purto Manús, just walk the way towards the beach in 50 meters you'll find the steps to cross  underneath the motorway."
102099,2156094,3,payasoloko,01/08/2022,There is quite a bit of dust and traffic from cars/trucks. In a few meters of distance there are areas without mosquitoes or with many. Beautiful views of the Ebro at sunset.
102099,1796905,3,OliviaPanthera,27/03/2022,"Nice view of the Ebro. There are several lay-bys along the gravel road. A few cars drive by day and night, so not very quiet, you can hear the traffic too. A good place for one night and in this location."
102103,3240356,1,Clabalos,30/08/2023,The police have orders to lower all the folding roofs although this contravenes DGT regulations. You have to give up because if you don't they can touch you but it is clear that this town hall is bought by some campsite that wants you to pay. Regrettable.
102103,3099485,5,Luasintes,08/08/2023,"Quiet area, next to Somo beach and walking a few more meters there is a great beach for dogs. It is a pay zone from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. (just over €5 for 10 hours). Shower on the beach. A few meters from the town center, perfect for a drink at night. Fair width and length space for a 6 meter camper protruding a few centimeters from the line. The first square is quite wide."
102103,2943533,3,parkfornightburken,09/07/2023,A bit small(there was poles on the sidewalk) for our 6meters so we went to the port instead
102103,2165103,5,parkformaeva,02/08/2022,We spent one night in this parking lot in a Campervan. We arrived around 8 p.m. and left the next day around 6 p.m. Parking is paid by the day but very cheap (about 5€/6€). There were other CCs and Vans with us. Very quiet and the beach is right next to it (see photos).
102103,1693291,2,ashleighlou96,19/11/2021,Settled in for the night only to then be disturbed by a resident at 11pm who said we couldn’t sleep there and asked if we had toilet etc in the van. So we moved to other side of town on a street.
102103,1274682,2,dantewilo,24/06/2021,Blue zone you have to pay
102103,1181439,3,KePaXeta,29/04/2021,Quiet cul-de-sac to spend the night and close to the Ferri beach nearby. No services
102103,649771,1,Krasty1,21/08/2019,"Eye, in Somo they are fine any van or motorhome that leaves the parking lines, the places are small and it is easy to get out. They want me to spend the night in the area"
102103,508196,3,23bauer23,08/06/2019,"Nice night. good for bigger cars (max. 7m), beach showers, no toilet"
102103,373870,3,mariacolin,15/09/2018,"A quiet night , no problems,"
102139,1163993,1,CharlyTG,02/04/2021,"We slept one night during the week, and no problem. But we returned another day (not consecutive) and we were very kindly woken up by a girl from private security telling us that she already saw us the other day and that she did not tell us anything, but that please do not stay overnight there and please do not return because I would have to notify the police. It is not a place to spend the night, yes during the day."
102139,1100742,4,OriolazoCA,21/10/2020,"Near Palma, quiet and spacious place. There were people at the last minute and first, since we assume that there are classes at all hours during the week."
102139,728053,3,Cartman26,23/10/2019,"Indeed, a large parking lot which obviously belongs to the nearby university center, we arrived there on October 22 in the evening and were late to leave, around 9:30 am someone from the site came to tell us to leave within 10 minutes. I think that arriving around 6.30pm / 7pm and leaving before 8.30am is playable. Rather good night."
102139,494795,4,Ladydy,28/05/2019,"Large parking near the university, very quiet for the night, well lit. However, very early in the week, people who park to go to university or work begin to arrive. On a weekend it is possible to be calmer during the day."
102139,449049,5,Bonnie70,04/04/2019,This is a great place but be aware that during the week the lot starts filling up at 8 am so best to be on your way early. We arrived about 7 pm and the lot was almost empty. We parked up near the field and orchard and it was a very nice quiet night. Recommend it
102143,2133177,4,estibaraka,27/07/2022,Car park located behind the Vilasante town hall and next to a park with picnic areas and plenty of shade. Public toilets are closed. We have spent 2 very quiet nights and it is a perfect location to visit Ribeira Sacra. The townspeople are very friendly and willing to lend a hand if necessary.
102143,1285566,3,XavierNieto,29/06/2021,"A very nice place, next to a park with stone tables and next to some public services. It is a parking lot located behind the town hall."
102147,3244088,1,TxetoPandilla,01/09/2023,It is the Palma Botellodrome. We didn't even last 5 minutes. Kids with music and drinking.
102147,2634599,3,labeaga,02/04/2023,We arrived in Mallorca at 5:30 in the morning. We got off the ferry and came here to sleep. We have been in 4 motorhomes. calm down
102147,2572274,2,steini1972,09/02/2023,Absolutely unsuitable for mobile homes because it is much too short for cars and buses
102147,2479792,1,julie26000,03/11/2022,awful night! calm when arriving in the parking lot then young people arrived with very very loud music and then the trucks which passed without stopping ..... worst night on the island !!
102147,2323532,1,Txaua,31/08/2022,nothing recommended. we had to leave as young people with loud music stood next to us. We went to another spot that is 10' from this one.
102147,1815124,1,BenenH,11/04/2022,"Super noisy with cars and music until late, and then the trucks stsrt passing in early morning. Handy for the ferry, that's the only saving grace."
102147,1644186,2,todoma,14/10/2021,"At the entrance it only puts cars. According to this, the squares are small. It is very close to the Balearia shipment."
102147,1533228,1,LaurayPedro,31/08/2021,"A lot of car traffic, at night to sleep there are many young people partying with the music blasting. Not recommendable!"
102147,1532522,1,pedro.vlc,30/08/2021,"Super close to the port, and the ferry, a critical site for young people drinking with music, it is not a place to spend more than one day."
102147,1493939,2,julenarteaga,21/08/2021,"Regular place to spend the night, cars pass and noise is heard. The good thing is that next to it there is a small and beautiful cove where you can take a bath. Very close to the ferry."
102147,1442653,1,eguzkienea,12/08/2021,"It is the perfect place ... if you are 18 years old and want to party with people. If you have another idea ... how to get some sleep ... come, take a picture and go quickly."
102147,1415679,1,cillo1984,06/08/2021,"Bad site. As soon as we arrived to sleep the last night before catching the ferry, we already found groups of people drinking. If you want to rest a bit at 8 min there is another park4night much better for it. We switched to that site and very well."
102147,1191950,1,mikaelo,10/05/2021,Really stressful. Lots of young people and loud music.
102147,1098371,1,zeke77,19/10/2020,"Very noisy, regeton all night."
102147,1082589,2,Jessi2803,05/10/2020,"Good to catch the ferry the next morning otherwise unsuitable. Loud young people at night, right next to the street, parking bays for 6m + Womos unsuitable."
102147,1064520,1,elias653723,22/09/2020,"At night it fills up with people making a bottle, the police pass by and don't say anything to them ... terrible"
102147,1057079,1,b166er,18/09/2020,"Botellon. Music people and traffic, the opposite that you are looking for to sleep."
102147,942612,2,Sebaguibert,09/08/2020,"Very nice location, but young people come to party at this place at night. Music blast, we had to change places at 2:30 am to sleep."
102147,920784,2,jahonslide,02/08/2020,"Great view, good place to eat but too noisy to stay and sleep. We left at 2:30 in the morning because the young people meet here to party and listen to very loud music."
102147,475490,3,JuliTes,04/05/2019,Free parking We spent the night on a Friday and it was quite noisy because the cars stopped with loud music and the next day many trucks pass by. After that no inconvenience. Safe place.
102147,450713,1,MirMad,08/04/2019,"Good asphalted and straight parking, with beautiful views. We used it from Sunday through Monday, and from 5am they did not stop going through the road (3 meters away) TENS of large trucks on the way to the port. At dawn begins to walk people in the area and parking, and then it is an enclave where buses of teenagers stop on the end of the year, and lords of the IMSERSO. I would not repeat."
102147,441811,5,Bonnie70,19/03/2019,We got off the ferry and drove right to this spot just as the sun went down. Lovely views. A few cars were there at sunset but by dark it was empty. Quiet for the braying of a donkey which we never located! Traffic picks up on the road about 6am. Easy access. We’ll probably use this spot again before we leave on the ferry.
102147,436611,2,The.Wicksy.Wanderers,05/03/2019,"Stayed one night. Traffic too noisy. In the morning, a hooker was hanging around the motorhome!"
102147,422177,4,fareta,13/01/2019,"Very good place, very close to where the Balearía ferry arrives, ""something"" of distant traffic and good views."
102147,412483,5,Martifurgo,07/12/2018,Very quiet near Palma
102157,3191077,1,nicosara,20/08/2023,In high season a mousetrap
102157,2814006,3,dupi24,03/06/2023,"Well, while strolling we found much better"
102157,2602551,4,Tempete2983,08/03/2023,"Great place and good spot for fishermen, we spent several days there without problems, quiet night, no services but shops, laundry and restaurants nearby."
102157,1237412,4,Rubenlo,05/06/2021,Close to everything.
102157,941616,2,Tiscoski,09/08/2020,Lots of people walking by and lots of car noise. No bueno.
102166,2469236,3,Ranchoneta,29/10/2022,"there are many more parking spaces than three, there are toilets and showers (only cold). paved to the very entrance. If you go during the week you will be practically alone except for a couple from the town, but they go about their business and nothing bothersome, in summer it has to be overwhelming, very clean, please keep it that way. mobile coverage 0. note that you can not camp. As far as I know, spend the night, yes."
102190,933585,4,ToInfinityAndBeyond,06/08/2020,"Quiet place to spend the night, just park on the side of the road."
102192,2547611,3,DaisyAndOlaf,09/01/2023,"It's fine to go shopping, the Max height is 3 meters, even so, be careful inside the parking lot, there are ducts on the ceiling and lamps. Gasoline is really not that cheap, you can find it at a better price."
102192,651426,5,osildur,22/08/2019,The super cheap gasoline. You have a bathroom in the lower part of the covered parking. There is free wifi.
102192,414007,4,alvarobi,13/12/2018,"Parking of the supermarket. Quiet and quite secluded area. Very cheap gasoline (the cheapest in the area and by far). Super, bar and restaurant."
102192,391398,5,patarie,11/10/2018,Wc clean and wifi
102192,374125,3,toshy90,15/09/2018,"Nothing special. No overnight. 
Wifi works best upstairs.
Diesel was 1.094 today. Cheapest we've seen in the region by a lot."
102201,937162,3,Nat1984,07/08/2020,"If you arrive in Olite around noon and taking into account that the area of the municipality has no shade, this picnic area is a good option. there is shade although we had to climb the motorhome (there is no curb) outside the asphalt area. there is only one table. It is next to the national."
102238,2010139,3,Artu69,25/06/2022,Good day parking for excursions. Bad for sleeping because it is quite inclined
102238,402886,1,didi1957,02/11/2018,"Bof, sloping parking, we went a little further."
102290,2632418,4,Spanien2023,31/03/2023,"3/28/23 Relatively small, quiet place. Sanitary facilities are a bit outdated, but well maintained. Good bus connection to the city, approx. 20 minutes travel time. Ideal for exploring the city. Friendly service."
102290,1477382,2,Alice63,18/08/2021,"Pleasant location but passers-by told us that it was inconvenient as we only took one parking space and the parking lot was empty. In town, feeling of not being welcome ... We finally opted for camping."
102296,1693317,1,danutsowa,19/11/2021,We stopped there during the day and weird people knocked to hour doors.
102296,449609,1,Bridget81,06/04/2019,To flee. Bad impression on arrival. Around 23h attempted theft on our bikes. Noise of LIDL fridges. We left in the middle of the night in the most welcoming nature.
102300,3203796,4,WillSexton,23/08/2023,"Beautiful spot, amazing stars on a clear night. a couple of cars but nothing bad. Unfortunately we had some teenagers come up to watch the sunrise supported with their own soundtrack..."
102300,3111662,2,Canela.,09/08/2023,Good to spend one night if you can't find anything else. It is a road siding; Dangerous for animals and children.
102300,2795911,3,Silvio2020,28/05/2023,"It's not a parking lot, just a wider bay next to the road. On Sunday there is really a lot of passage to the chapel behind. Therefore, it is not suitable for relaxation during the day."
102300,2688285,5,marva49,22/04/2023,Nice place with views all around. Recycle bin available.
102300,2328123,4,chinchetos,01/09/2022,"Quiet place with very nice views. A car passes by but after 10 p.m. everything is calm. In the morning we had some small boars for a visit, used to people and without problems."
102300,1697560,5,EY660,25/11/2021,"Absolutely beautiful view. Very nice for a night with the motorhome. The approach with our old HYMER was a bit steep, but still feasible. But worth the effort alone because of the breathtaking view!"
102300,1689069,4,NoemieKunkler,14/11/2021,"Great place for sunrise and the view!
For my taste it's still too close from the highway and you can hear it.
Also hunters come by on Sunday and sometimes Thursday morning, they are friendly and it doesn't matter if you already woke up for the sunrise!"
102300,1640691,5,EmielEefje,12/10/2021,We didn’t stay for the night. But it’s worth visiting even for only the view!
102300,1496695,4,FJRH,22/08/2021,"Great location to spend one night. It's very quiet during the night, only one car came by (as far as we noticed). During the morning after 08:00 you'll notice the occational biker and other locals going up to the monument. Flattest location is the extra wide road where you have a great sunrise view. The location is clean, but once you get in the bushes people forget to clean up their toilet paper"
102300,1220067,4,schurlithevan,27/05/2021,"Great place for one night! It is very quiet and there is not much traffic on the road. Dustbin available. It is definitely worth 5 stars, but I only give it if there is a shower and / or toilet."
102300,1033435,5,kajotravels,07/09/2020,"A great spot !! We were all alone, but you have to say that we are out of the season. Even during the day there were hardly any people up there! We had a sensational sunset and an even more beautiful sunrise. We were really above the clouds and it was wonderful. The spots to stand are paved and I can recommend the spot between the little house and the last cross. That is exactly where the sun rises. Alternatively, for the sunset from the camper, you could stand in advance on one of the side lawns that come before left and right. I don't know if this is allowed. At night, unfortunately, a few but less loud and fast cars drove along this street. It even woke you up."
102300,626899,5,Sebxs37,14/08/2019,Super spot !!! Sunrise and sunset exceptional. Very calm ! Little passage. Camper friends: stop using toilet paper! Use water when you shit! Tired of seeing pq everywhere!
102302,3256426,5,adbs24,04/09/2023,Great with the beach nearby!
102302,2740271,3,Roonoo,10/05/2023,We spent a night there parked next to the Aqua Hotel****. We do not recommend this side of the parking lot for a quiet morning sleep because the hotel deliveries are very frequent and just behind!
102302,2552939,5,CFam,16/01/2023,"We parked here with our 7,2m mh, we had a quiet night. Cars passing all day but stops at night. There’s a steep entrance but we could get on the parking. There are containers for rest, plastic, paper and glass. Shop, restaurant, tattoo shop, gym, sea just a few steps away."
102302,2463299,4,AhyokaMaka,26/10/2022,Unfortunately the entrance is too steep for us. have to go on.
102302,2315984,4,logave,29/08/2022,"There are 2 car parks, one paved and flat but with a height limit of 2'20, and another right next to the dirt. Many cars and some campers. Well lit and seems safe."
102302,2049936,5,kikiya,08/07/2022,"The night was very quiet. No noise. Maybe it's better to find some shade on another street. We were lucky because it was not hot. At first we doubted because there was no motorhome but there are many cars. There is also a car park next to the Local Police where there were three ACs, but it is further away."
102302,2011028,3,Xurrascu,26/06/2022,We have spent the night and it has been very noisy. Many people until so many in the morning screaming. From 5 o'clock it has been quieter.
102302,1573206,5,rafavk,12/09/2021,Good place to spend a few nights very quiet.
102302,1020540,3,pacasu,02/09/2020,"We parked on the street before, there are shadows and it is not a very noisy street due to traffic"
102302,944594,5,janleon,09/08/2020,"You can park without any problem, the local police do not tell you anything, as long as you respect the parking rules, but be careful in case it rains a lot, we go every year in the hotel for a few days and then we stay for a few more days , I totally recommend it, greetings and enjoy"
102302,681446,5,janleon,08/09/2019,"It is a very good place to park with total tranquility, it is 5 minutes from the beach and with all the hotels and restaurants, and shops to buy a lot of parties and lots of people nearby, we come every year and we will keep coming, we love the Zone and we recommend you enjoy. Greetings colleagues."

102303,2923222,5,Jayne8130,04/07/2023,Lovely night's sleep and a fabulous full day on the bridge and along the river. The lower carpark is small with a narrow single track with NO passing possible so definitely stay here for Ponto 516
102303,2782167,5,Julez0803,24/05/2023,"Good for the hike, we didn't spend the night here."
102303,2684522,4,roulibre,20/04/2023,"calm and a bit lost, not very flat. But essential to make the footbridges of paiva. the other car park is very inaccessible by CC. Allow 20 minutes on foot to reach the start of the Paiva footbridges. From this departure count 45 minutes to go to the departure of the arouca 516 suspension bridge. (Attention booking on the internet). the footbridges are free up to the bridge. Everything is great!"
102303,2548629,4,jenwalsh,10/01/2023,"Great overnight stop, the paiva walkways are hard don’t try them if you can’t walk up lots and lots and lots of steps! The parking is great, although no facilities so bring water and be sure you have all you need as it is quite remote! from the parking area you can walk down around 1.5km to the cafe & toilet and the onward around 1km to the start of the walkways, it’s uphill from the start beware"
102303,2527969,4,BiermannJupp,25/12/2022,On 12/10/22 we stayed overnight after visiting the bridge and really magical hiking trail at Paiva.Very quiet and beautiful! We would stand here again at any time. (Marauder)JB
102303,2412186,5,balade56,29/09/2022,"Spacious parking lot, few cc in late September. Tranquility, cleanliness, level. We spent one night there, thanks to the municipality"
102303,2091168,1,matthieuablin,18/07/2022,ATTENTION: footbridges closed to the public since July 12 due to the high risk of fires. Check the opening information on the footbridges website before you go there.
102303,2089422,4,matthieuablin,18/07/2022,"Parking lot with plenty of spaces. Places in the sun during the day and on a slope (provide chocks). Ideal for spending the night (no noise). Possibility to walk to the footbridges by a dirt road in 20 minutes. Parking accessible with a 7m motorhome. Beware of GPS: ours has lost us. It took 3h30 to arrive from Porto instead of 1h initially planned! No parking service. On the other hand, on the lower one: shower (cold water?) and snack."
102303,2018997,5,FridaJanz,28/06/2022,"We stayed the night after visiting the bridge and the really magical hiking trail at Paiva. A little crooked, but it worked with wedges. Very calm and beautiful!"
102303,2010233,5,KindAussieCouple,25/06/2022,"Quiet spot, great location to start the walk, but no shade will get busy when hikers start arriving. Would recommend staying here rather than near the bridge."
102303,1787305,5,tonibaker,18/03/2022,"Huge car park but roads getting there were not the easiest! The is a big bin. Steep walk to the start of the trail which took 20-30 mins (with kids). The parking at the start of the trial, is fine for cars/small vans but the access road is incredibly steep so park here instead. Toilets by the cafe/bar at the trail start. Lovely beach and rocks to climb near the start so the kids were very happy."
102303,1769394,5,jeanettepage,28/02/2022,"excellent place to stay overnight after going across the bridge. Very quiet and safe. 
We are over 8m and the roads to get here are a bit scary! In the summer it is probably really busy."
102303,1597093,4,thomas76740,21/09/2021,Quiet and restful place for the night the footbridges is a 10-minute walk away. Watch out for the wind at night
102303,1351828,5,ScullyMountains,22/07/2021,The final part of the car park is reserved for AC with its corresponding sign. Ground floor. For Campers the use of chocks will not always be necessary.
102303,1223108,4,schurlithevan,28/05/2021,"We didn't sleep in the parking lot, but the parking lot has a specially designated parking space for campers and is safe to sleep. It is important to have wedges as the area is sloping."
102303,1083824,5,XamenEk,06/10/2020,"Easy access for large truck or large motorhome. The walk of the bridges is superb, I strongly recommend. Possibility of sleeping without worries, we spent several very quiet nights."

102303,680854,5,2emilouant,07/09/2019,"Parking from the starting point of the pedestrian walkway. On site there is water toilets that stay open all night. The little snack is super nice and we confirmed the possibility of spending the night there. You are at the edge of the river, it is a paradise that is easily delivered and when the evening falls it is only for you. Last night of our discovery of Portugal we loved it."
102303,661059,2,Lapamillas,26/08/2019,"Ground parking, slightly inclined, is accessed by a dirt track. Quiet place, people park and go on excursions or go down to the river. There is a good walk along a very steep track to the river and the cafeteria. It has bins and nothing else."
102305,723882,2,LucianaCZ,17/10/2019,"The fountain missing water tap, we used pliers but the water flow is very low. We did not stay but it looks it will be hard to find flat ground."
102321,2144201,4,viajetor,30/07/2022,"We have spent a very quiet night, only the river that is next to the parking lot could be heard and around there is only a farmhouse. Very good place to spend a night in the mountains and near Bilbao, although there are no bathrooms and we have not seen a fountain."
102321,1849378,4,trippyz,24/04/2022,"heavy rainy days on our route, and having little rain gear in the van, this spot was perfect for protection one night small river nearby, calm, only one car will pass in the evening. we were at the spot of the church of san Lorenzo just before for dinner under the sheltered chapel, but not sheltered enough compared to this small car park"
102321,1407622,4,Eva.Dmz,05/08/2021,"Super quiet, clean and fairly flat place. Fit 3 motorhomes. Containers nearby. Climbing routes just behind and starting point for various excursions. Ideal to come with children"
102321,1175977,3,MaiteAnaia,18/04/2021,We only made a stop as a starting point to see the Baltzola caves. When we returned we did eat in the motorhome. it looked like the place was deserted at night. by day it was very quiet. there are garbage bins.
102321,729700,3,pdegeus,25/10/2019,Perfect for visiting the caves. Illuminated and quiet at night. No amenities.
102335,890361,1,klvrs03,22/07/2020,"I confirm that the road is very narrow and without stops. Luckily we did not come across any car, if that was the case, I don't even want to think about it. Then the place is super quiet, but those ""views"" of the swamp are very disappointing due to all the undergrowth."
102335,389812,4,Marcelin_SER,08/10/2018,"Very quiet location Beware of the very narrow road on a large portion, impossible crossings, mandatory backing on several hundred meters ..."
102342,950672,3,dmoliner,11/08/2020,Good for a technical stop if you don't need any service.
102342,694809,1,LVX655DR,17/09/2019,"Well just for one night and visit the city, very close to the center. The camper van below is quite pitiful, for my part."
102342,451129,1,tudelano,08/04/2019,Having the parking area next to it does not make sense. Parking trucks and the days of the game is full of cars.
102342,391907,3,Golonko,12/10/2018,"Valid to spend the night. I think even quieter than the area. Yes, quite dirty."
102357,751324,3,wayopa,08/12/2019,"Correct for parking, although they are narrow. trucks are parked in the area. we did not see it suitable for sleeping there are many bars around and parks very suitable for large bottles"
102374,3008861,1,asebas16,23/07/2023,"Spectacular place but FINED. After spending the night with two other vans, two nature protection agents arrived at 10am and asked for our ID and proposed us for sanction. We were only spending the night without having taken out tables or chairs."
102374,2313840,5,aliestmar,28/08/2022,Good place to spend the night and bathe. I recommend it.
102374,2194134,5,lololiege,07/08/2022,"beautiful little corner of nature. ideal for cooling off in a splendid river. No difficulty in motorhome to return, however no network and no shade. Quiet night."
102374,2121100,4,RockNRull,25/07/2022,good place to park and spend the day in the river. be very careful when you enter from the road with the piece of step there is. I recommend at night to see the stars. also in the restaurant the sales have a pickled veal.
102374,2072511,4,Amarka203,14/07/2022,"The place is wonderful and even more so in this heat wave, the only thing being very careful when entering the road from the road is a considerable step, being able to leave it in the shade is almost impossible because there is only one tree, but it is all worth it get to the bridge and see the pools, very clean waters."
102374,1782314,4,laclassebuissonniere,13/03/2022,One of our best spots since our arrival in Spain. We were there alone... with the griffon vultures. The bridge and the riverside are lovely. Need wedges. No network.
102374,1425330,5,cabcris,08/08/2021,"A spectacular place to take a bath or a walk, we have slept alone with a Camper, the parking lots soon fill up ..."
102374,1281072,4,sidzero,27/06/2021,"Quiet place to sleep (we were alone) with the sound of frogs and water, dirt road but easy, limited to 15 vehicles maximum, very close to the River and a bridge with beautiful views, yes there are no bins at least when we we went, so collect your waste the cleaner we leave everything the better! a greeting and km"
102374,1099100,4,colin13x,19/10/2020,"Nice spot near the river, very quiet this time of year ( October ). good walk out into the fields. as you drive in the first turning better for small campers, one flat area across the bridge, or second entrance down hill for larger AC, not to level but OK, we stayed two nights"
102374,1095568,4,Roel964,16/10/2020,A fantastically beautiful place but very popular on weekends and holidays.
102374,967045,5,CristinaSimon,15/08/2020,"Good area to spend the day and take a dip in the pools. Parking is limited to 15 vehicles, so go early."
102374,871150,5,pusyneta,15/07/2020,Spectacular area to meet and take a bath in the river. It is worth spending !!!!
102405,3135943,5,Protasia,13/08/2023,"Very familiar camping, exceptional treatment. The plots are large because our AC is large and has fit perfectly, leaving space even to put a table and chairs and to hang out the towels. It has a shaded children's playground area. The services are very clean. The restaurant is terrific, spectacular custom-made paellas. We came by chance and stayed one more night to enjoy."
102405,3091751,5,T4VAN,07/08/2023,"Small family campsite, very quiet. Services and bar access by stone stairs at the top but very close. An area with old but charming swings under the pines for the little ones. The owners are very friendly with a very familiar treatment. We have only stayed one night because we were passing through but we will repeat for sure. Price €20 plot with electricity. 1 camper 2 people and 1 child."

102405,2990619,5,jeanjulien35,20/07/2023,"Very quiet campsite. Super reasonable price for 2 adults and 2 children with electricity 23 euros. The managers are very friendly. They offer bar and restaurants. Functional toilets. The frame is great. The swimming pool is very good, away from the pitches. Beautiful walks to do around. Go there without worries."
102405,1974284,4,laGosi,13/06/2022,"Camping recently opened by the new owners, in the lower part it has about 20 plots, suitable for large Ac, in addition to an area for changing water, in the upper part a play area for the kids and a building with complete and clean toilets, bar and reception."
102405,1759459,1,APK1217,18/02/2022,"It's definitely not open all year round. The signs look new, but it's hibernation."
102405,1037817,5,paolopaladini,09/09/2020,We really liked this campsite ... everything very clean € 18 a car and two people. the showers and toilets super clean
102432,3204246,5,leafe,23/08/2023,"Beautiful area ! The view is beautiful. There is a nice parking space and clean toilets. There is a cute little snack bar next door. We had a few passing cars and fishermen. You can go swimming at the Praia fluvial da Lomba, 10 minutes by car, which is really pretty. We went at 7 p.m. there were a lot less people and the water is good."
102432,3090909,5,park24492,06/08/2023,"Attention, do not follow the GPS through the alleys of the village, impossible to go down by van. Walking around, very nice place."
102432,2816374,5,Grahamu,03/06/2023,"Access from the north only as access from the south is very narrow and steep.
Otherwise a good place."
102432,2779153,4,MrNathanParis,23/05/2023,"quiet little place, with water, stone tables and toilets. the toilets were not particularly clean.  the view of the river was amazing."
102432,2538758,4,finniundjuliontour,02/01/2023,"So the toilets weren't really that clean when we spent the night there! A dog barked quite a long time in the evening and then in the morning too, but he is further away and it doesn't really bother us! The view of the Douro is like being on another continent!!! We would come again!"
102432,2498476,4,kaj220,17/11/2022,Lovely quiet place to spend the night on the river. WCs (clean). No birds or other life!
102432,2423615,4,Ericboele,04/10/2022,Great quiet place no service only water and toilet End of dead end street. We used it as a base to Porto 30 minutes by car
102432,2286206,5,FabiFred,22/08/2022,"Very nice with water tap...!! from the n222, go down to the left at a small roundabout with indication of Lomba, always go down to the right with indications of Lomba and Beira Rio.

102432,439785,1,mabreizh56,14/03/2019,Can be very good but impossible to get there with a motorhome of 6 m by the indicated paths.
102432,399069,5,mikeed15,25/10/2018,Great place to spend the night - very quiet and great scenery.. Only approach from the north though. South approach very steep and narrow - only just got though with a small vw van. Local bar very friendly and have toilets.
102432,388104,3,PauloMozBarbosa,05/10/2018,"At the roundabout that indicates Lomba, follow the indication Beira Rio. They are a few hundred meters but in a safe road."
102437,2752668,4,borosiete,15/05/2023,Quiet site. We stopped to eat after completing the Júcar river cruise. Near the village.
102437,2635281,3,Joannamjj,02/04/2023,"Very nice place with drinking water and places for picnic, but unfortunately Guardia civil came and told us we can’t stay longer than one night."
102437,1802079,4,Juanangarcia,31/03/2022,"Beautiful place next to the river and very close to Cofrentes with access by newly paved road. Very wide area to stop to spend the day and spend the night. We spent a very quiet night, the civil guard often passes by and they did not tell us anything"
102437,1444478,3,courrier,12/08/2021,"A fairly large space with tables and a water fountain and lots of trees. It has toilets but they cannot be used, they are abandoned and very dirty. Views of the lake and castle of Cofrentes. You can also see the nuclear power plant. We have spent the night very calm. The Civil Guard and the foresters saw us and said nothing."
102437,1427860,2,Martha36,09/08/2021,Some places around here have actually some pretty beautiful views but the issue is the nuclear plant close by.. for us its a two star..
102437,1032053,4,Perricamper,07/09/2020,We stopped for breakfast and the place is very nice and quiet.
102437,774371,1,Traveltiger,30/01/2020,A really great place to stay!  500 m away from the launch of the Cofrentes nuclear power plant !!  We drove on immediately.  The thought of sleeping below the nuclear power plant is horrible ...
102437,751395,4,shirley88,08/12/2019,"Had a peaceful night. Not a very special place, but great for a night. Supervisor stood with his car on the site for a while, but was friendly and said nothing about our stay."
102437,725331,3,laspescadillasviajeras,19/10/2019,Good place to relax and make a small excursion of 4 (round trip) kilometers to the pier. We have not stayed overnight for the comments.
102437,527434,4,PepSaig,24/06/2019,"Good place to spend the night and, just the reverse of what happened to Bambo 1543, the Civil Guard came to talk for a while and said yes you could stay overnight but in no way camping. They were friendly."
102437,480830,3,seantamsin,10/05/2019,Good parking area with water supply. Hole in the ground toilets were filthy. Lots of mosquitoes as by the water.

102445,3284751,4,aparkatu,11/09/2023,"A beautiful and calm place for a night. Difficult path with stones and sable, but detours can be found. (Peugeot Boxer)"
102445,3282869,4,GretaGruen,10/09/2023,"Very nice, quiet, lonely place, if there weren't some contemporaries to whom peace and standing freely in nature with a little distance are completely alien...no one who stands freely wants campsite flair. Due to the partly loose ground, large distances between vehicles are not possible, at this point you can actually only stand alone, see existing pictures."
102445,3094494,5,bizzagliabelen,07/08/2023,"Superb view, quiet, plenty of space, very clean."
102445,2955204,5,disco4002,12/07/2023,"We stayed one night in this place. there were locals bathing in the river. But in the evening there were only a few walkers. It is a calm and peaceful place, which we recommend 100%. We still asked the question to locals on site who told us that they had no worries and that we could stay there. Keep the place clean Thank you"
102445,2251824,3,Titidu47,16/08/2022,"Spot really (too) humid. Potentially dangerous access depending on the vehicle. We ended up on the edge of the fields (possibility to settle down very comfortably), calm, a few walkers in the morning. Very nice paved path."
102445,2215326,5,maxhart6,11/08/2022,"Great spot, no one, preferably done with a 4x4 to reach the end of the dirtroad! Only copy the coordinates instead of going through the app directions otherwise you end up in a housing neighboorhood 2 km away!"
102445,2215242,5,iamTommy,11/08/2022,"Beautiful scenery, spent a calm night by the riverside, no mosquitoes but a few flys…a little bit of off-roading to reach the right spot so more doable in 4x4 cars"
102445,2204412,5,Gian-LucaBonderer,09/08/2022,"Beautiful spot with a lot of space! we will stay another night! Request to young couple with baby, who stayed here tonight with us: we are missing a grey plastic box with clothes in it. some of them have huge emotional value. is it possible, that you accidentally took it with you, when you left this afternoon? it would mean a lot to us if we could get them back!"
102445,1975097,5,ChivanJonny,13/06/2022,"Perfect spot right on the river. Just a few locals coming to swim. Be careful, especially when there is a full moon, do not park near the water, the water rises extremely quickly. During our stay, the driveway was also under water at times. Access road relatively narrow, only recommended for smaller vans."

total silence. close to the little village. felt safe.
few people doing trekking in the morning. passing by, no problems at all.
ground is quite dirty tough."
102458,1651650,3,Lescropagnons,18/10/2021,"Very special place. View of the city and quiet; however it is very dirty and with high voltage lines. It makes it to spend 1 night but should not be too difficult. On the other hand, the white and beige cat is very welcoming and will give you lots of hugs"
102458,1393458,1,yamil_87,02/08/2021,"The site is not, far from it, in the middle of nature. In addition, it is very dirty and is a drinking area for young people. Not recommended"
102458,1067429,3,LMartelo,24/09/2020,"Enough out of town for a quiet night. Narrow uphill path, only for small vans. very dirty. It was not possible to have breakfast there due to the bad smell of the area"

Thank you very much to the city council for this area, please, let's take care of it and spend money in the town because the area is free."

Against: barking at night, a train during the day, streetlights from 9pm to midnight (they should leave at least one) it is extremely dark. Slightly dusty area, allergic eye. Lots of shade; you do not charge (a pity they do not have light)."
102481,3213474,5,MariaCuvillo,24/08/2023,"Excellent site, very shaded, surrounded by nature, with free emptying and filling of water. In the old mill there are showers and toilets for one euro, a luxury. There are walks between pine forests and the town is about 600 meters away, where there is a municipal swimming pool. You sleep wonderfully, the only drawback is that they turn off all the lights in the area and you are left in complete darkness..."

102481,3086458,5,GeoCaston,06/08/2023,"super quiet. Wide spaces. It is easy to get there because it is also illuminated but the lights go out around 12. The town has a swimming pool, paddle tennis court, playgrounds and a soccer field."

For €1 you open the door that gives access to the toilet area and showers with hot water. emptying and filling area right next to it. better to park in reverse to be able to get out better later if there is more ac. Note that 200m before there is a level crossing and it is better to go slowly. Very bright place with led streetlights that go off around 00:15"

Beautiful place in the middle of nature, super clean and beautiful bathrooms and showers (for 1 euro you have access to the entrance) it is worth paying for it just to see how beautiful and well-kept it is. A 10 for this town for giving us this wonderful area in which to be"
102481,2848005,4,dirkprd,12/06/2023,"Have been here several times… the only downside is that there are no coat hooks or even simple hooks in the sanitary building to hang towels and clothes, nor a rack to put shampoo and shower gel on… a lovely shower"
102481,2844985,5,Tamlac,11/06/2023,"A free area, with services for 1 euro, frankly a very nice surprise. Nature in peace and in addition public lighting on the area. Do not hesitate, it is really worth the detour. Many thanks to the community."
102481,2770878,5,sixfootfam,21/05/2023,"Perfect for a one night stopover! Very calm place, shaded place. Possibility of a hot shower… just one euro is enough for a couple!

102481,2716743,5,LosDelgado,02/05/2023,"A charming place where you can relax in the shade of the trees listening to the birds sing. A ten minute walk from a very welcoming town with several routes to do by bike or on foot. The bathrooms are very clean and well cared for. In addition to the small river nearby, the municipal swimming pool is great for the summer."

102481,2652905,4,Kim.S,09/04/2023,"Attention: It can always only ! one! Showers, no matter how many are available. The water pressure is not enough for more than one shower. Please take care of each other and wait while someone is still in the shower! I recommend a No Dogs & No Smoking sign in the showers, again French people bring in their dog and lit fag."
102481,2651650,5,avgVG,08/04/2023,"Perfect place to spend the night, quiet place and also for only €1 you have a hot shower and bathroom in very good condition, it also has a tap outside and picnic tables, highly recommended!!!"

102481,2538615,3,Molenaar,02/01/2023,"Beautiful place and you can go for a nice walk… that's what we did after we were there around 4 pm. When we came back from our walk, there were some cars and a van with a sound box on the other side at the picnic benches… really not normal what a sound came out of that. The other camper had already left and so did we. We were just unlucky .. would have loved to spend the night here."
102481,2536230,1,chabiron,01/01/2023,"Magnificent motorhome area. Clean water, gray water and free toilet emptying, for 1 euro you have accessible toilets and showers it is very clean but not heated inside and no hot water for the showers... and 1 socket is missing for the ladies to draw to dry your hair but frankly the place and at the TOP it would take more places like that"
102481,2533725,5,Silenkyraontheroad,30/12/2022,"A beautiful place in nature, nice base for a walk through the woods. We were the only ones there. You can enter the toilet block with showers by putting one euro in the coin machine at the door. Please note, only one euro coins fit. Toilets and showers were very clean! Thanks for this nice place, enjoyed 3 days here."
102481,2529911,5,FRK14,27/12/2022,Thanks to the city of Quintana redonda for this pleasant space. An example to follow.
102481,2496111,5,IrisKuiper93,15/11/2022,"Nice place under the trees. Sanitary facilities can be used for 1 euro, are well maintained and are very clean. You can even use a shower. In the fall it was beautiful and I can imagine that the shade of the trees in the summer is very pleasant. Furthermore, a quiet place to spend the night."
102481,2494469,5,Myfootprints,13/11/2022,"Great place. Under the trees, toilet and shower for a fee, some picnic tables and hiking opportunities. We saw a few deer around the camper place. Wonderful, quiet night spent on the way to Madrid. Highly recommended."
102481,2494219,5,CapitanClick,13/11/2022,"Just perfect. All the services are operational, everything is clean, quiet... it's not the first time we've come and it won't be the last. Just to put a but... Could you bring the town a little closer to the area?"
102481,2484072,5,Vanessa-J.A,05/11/2022,"After visiting Soria and not knowing where to spend the night, we chose this place based on your comments and it is totally worth it. It is a very quiet and well-kept area as it has excellent hot water showers and is very clean for only 1 euro, although you do have to have euro coins to open the door."
102481,2460025,5,alain1979,24/10/2022,"Bravo for Quintana Redonda! Spectacular area totally in a natural environment between poplars. A small river passes nearby, it is 1km from the town. The town pools are a 5-10 minute walk away. Illuminated place although around midnight the lights go out, you rest wonderfully. Great place for walking or cycling routes. Plane on land. Amazing place!"
102481,2450473,5,Bamba_on_tour,18/10/2022,"Just wow. After nearly 5 months of travelling around Europe in our van, this is one of the best spots ever! free night among the trees, and just 1 euro for AMAZING WC/shower facilities! perfect! The Junta of Quintana Redonda have done an amazing thing here. the little town is great to explore, but buy your cold beers at the Mini Market and not the bars.. if not Spanish, you'll be ripped off.."
102481,2412750,5,losgrassodieste,30/09/2022,"A spectacular place, secluded, very wooded. Very well maintained bathrooms. A 15-minute walk from the town of Quintana Redonda (200 inhabitants). If you need calm, stop by. Highly recommended!"
102481,2411691,5,foxtrotnovembersierra,29/09/2022,"We came through here on our way to Madrid. The showers are absolutely brilliant, nice and hot, very clean and modern. The €1 charge is just to open the door so is all we paid for the two of us. I would recommend turning the shower on to warm up while you get ready as it took a while, and only one run shower at a time as it affects the pressure and temperature to run more at once."
102481,2402249,5,CL33,25/09/2022,"Everything has been said in the previous comments, it's exceptional to find such a place that brings together all the qualities for a good stopover! I note ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐!"

102481,2387279,5,Mairos,20/09/2022,"Quite a luxury, shaded and level sites, with lighting, emptying of grays and blacks and filling with water. It has no electricity outlet. Excellence is achieved thanks to the building in which for only 1 euro, to open the door, in an old mill, you have clean bathrooms and showers with hot water, a real luxury. We stayed one night perfectly. There is an area with a barbecue and tables."
102481,2386215,5,1ukyluc,19/09/2022,This is one of the most peacefull place I've ever seen (in 24 years of vanlife)
102481,2363038,5,rubio_minina,11/09/2022,"Excellent area for all that it offers for free. We have found the bathrooms open (we assume that users who were already here have left it that way for convenience) but we will leave our contribution anyway and I encourage you to do so even if you find them open. Thanks to the town hall for this great area. Please, let's collaborate so that it continues like this and we all enjoy it."
102481,2332932,5,mverjano,02/09/2022,"Magnificent, we are going to pay but only park we realize that it is very, very well thought out. As Cabinet Caligary said... I'm on my way to Soria. Great, splendid, there are no words."

102481,2299665,5,AlberDlc,25/08/2022,A splendid place to rest and unwind. Parking spaces are wide and level. The toilets and showers (symbolic price of €1) very clean. At night there is light until almost midnight.
102481,2289277,5,aplikacion,23/08/2022,"Simply spectacular. The interior of the building shows the operation of a mill. And to the left gives access to impeccable bathrooms with shower. There are benches and a barbecue (closed), as well as a small stream with bridges."
102481,2281019,5,sebp170,21/08/2022,in the top. quiet and service for 1euros.
102481,2247797,4,Taniaeinigo2019,16/08/2022,"Wooded area with shadows, 1km walk from the town with a walking area, new toilets with shower (it has access for €1 but they were open with a stone so that it would not close). emptying and filling area. It has tables and barbecue. very calm. It does not have a light point and in the bathroom there are no plugs either, it is what would improve and the floor is made of stones, it would be good to pave. but to be free... a 10!"
102481,2220544,5,gloriavandita,12/08/2022,The place is very nice and quiet. We have only spent one night but it is a mandatory stop if you are passing by to recharge your batteries and sleep peacefully. Very clean toilets and area with lots of shade.
102481,2190412,5,AnnieP,07/08/2022,Lovely shaded area with plenty of space we are 8m long and no problems. Building with access of 1€ coin. Clean modern showers and toilets. Lovely walks around and you could walk to the village approx 1km but it was very hot and too far for us. Water available and black and grey waste disposal.

102481,1888857,4,soapyf,14/05/2022,In nature this is a beautiful place and all for free. well laid out pitches and able to take out chairs . Excellent showers for €1. It loses a star because of barking dogs and mosquitos. They are so big they bite through clothes and are just as bad during the day. If you aren't bothered by them it's perfect but we have had to move on.
102481,1887591,5,Javi13,13/05/2022,"One of the best areas of Soria, for its tranquility, for its shade, for its facilities. The terribly welcoming townspeople and an ideal forest for deer watching."
102481,1880874,4,Bituko,10/05/2022,"We were last weekend and we share everything said in previous comments, a more than correct area. Thanks to the people of Quintana Redonda for creating it. It is essential to walk around the surroundings (Soriano landscape in its purest form!) and also the Roman villa in the town of Cuevas de Soria, a marvel! Let's take care and support spaces like these!"
102481,1868330,5,jrgallego,03/05/2022,"Magnificent area. Good facilities and services. Good access, level and spacious spaces. The town is close. We will be back."
102481,1866856,5,oceeme,02/05/2022,"Tranquility, space, trees, lighting, Soriano cold and the possibility of a shower for €1 (paying it to go to the toilet while in the middle of nature seems less logical, but there it is...)"
102481,1864302,5,nice2seeu,01/05/2022,"Shade, tall trees, well graded, excellent soil drainage. Absolute tranquility. Train line less than a km; only one train passed in the time we were there. Conditioned walk to the town. We had to use the jack to raise the black cap: it had literally been welded to the ground, we don't know why. You should check it out. Service area ok."
102481,1863536,5,IKERMAN,01/05/2022,"Ideal site, nearby town, very well maintained, there is an old stone mill transformed into bathrooms with showers and toilets, to enter them 1 euro is worth it. Nature, river, picnic areas, WE WILL BE BACK"
102481,1842557,5,tmbngr,21/04/2022,"A very good area to spend the night. Especially camper vans and vehicles with tents. To access the toilet and shower services you need 1 euro. They are in very good condition and I ask that everyone please take care of the facilities. A mill recovered in time. There is no noise at night, the train is close but hardly any during the day."

102481,1825256,5,dirkprd,15/04/2022,"Beautiful and quiet place with good hot shower (1€). Space for 20 campers. The “routeplan” from google maps directs you completely wrong, to Las Cuevas de Soria and after on unsealed roads into the bushes, the road became so bad that I almost got stuck in the middle of nowhere"
102481,1823559,5,ricdan,15/04/2022,"places under the trees, possibility of emptying and filling for free. access to sanitary facilities with hot water for 1st (with coin mechanism on the door) thanks to the municipality"

102481,1799952,5,cperaile,29/03/2022,"Well, everything is perfect, without problems opening the door or hot water. Everything very clean. Charming countrymen. Of course, the navigator got a little confused and he took us to a town called ""Las Cuevas de Soria"" and put us on a dirt road. You have to get to Quintana Redonda and go through the town to the area. In summer it must be wonderful to spend a few days here. By the way, the torreznos at La Plaza bar are great. Congratulations and thank you for this highly recommended area."
102481,1796995,5,javivalcarcel,27/03/2022,We have spent a very quiet night with another motorhome.
102481,1795180,5,pticlod,25/03/2022,very beautiful area surrounded by nature. Thank you to the city for welcoming us in this way. today the water is restored.
102481,1752376,4,UteLausB,10/02/2022,Nice place to spend the night. Pretty straight and solid ground. I didn't test the showers. The water was unfortunately turned off in the outdoor area (probably because of the nightly frost). You can cycle to town in 5 minutes. The small grocery store has a very friendly seller. The bar next to it is rather mediocre.
102481,1744011,5,raspamovil,30/01/2022,"Excellent area in the middle of nature. The best are the showers with hot water and baths for €1. Everything works with solar energy, so if you swallow the euro and it doesn't open the next day, the town asks and the mayor, who is very nice, returns the euro."
102481,1742576,5,CaliforniaKid43,28/01/2022,"Superb area, thanks to the town hall. The lighting is reassuring, even if it goes out at night. alone in the middle of the woods, not very reassuring. Important to arrive: beware of Waze which may cut you through impassable forest paths if you are not equipped; and be careful at the level crossing just before arriving, because a few trains are still passing!! -8° tonight, frozen water"
102481,1738991,5,Bercris2,22/01/2022,"Perhaps the best area I have been spending several days in the summer. Shade, emptying and filling free and with showers and toilets at €1. very calm and when I had a problem, Pedro (councillor of the city council) appeared immediately to solve it. Congratulations to the people of Quintana R. for such an area. Do not forget to have some beers and torreznos at the bar. Huge pool very close."
102481,1703136,3,Mikfox,04/12/2021,"the perfect area, secluded and quiet. In the morning we did shopping and had something in the town and when we returned we went to change water, to fill it in three hours you do not do it, there was barely a trickle, I had to finish with jugs I take the opportunity to take a shower and I swallow the euro but He does not open the door or return the coin and to top it off the lights come on and we are alone and in the dark"
102481,1686148,2,LouiseSophie,12/11/2021,"The place is beautiful, but the showers and toilets were something else.. Me and my partner were having a shower at the same time in different showers, but when my partner got out, the power in the whole building went out so everything stopped working. The next day, the door to the toilets wouldn't open. A bit disappointing."
102481,1662375,5,sofi1961,25/10/2021,Superb location! There is even lighting at night! Beautiful walks to do in the neighboring pine forest.

102481,1651828,5,LilithVans,19/10/2021,"Hopefully more municipalities bet on spaces like this. It costs a lot to find shower areas without having to pay camping, or shower on the laptop. We were in August and just when we wanted to shower the door was broken and the euros were dealt with and the door would not open."
102481,1643542,5,magair,14/10/2021,Thanks to the City Council. Perfect I do not repeat myself in the descriptions of the rest of the users before me. It is a pleasure
102481,1637968,5,Igoros,10/10/2021,"It is time to congratulate the City Council of Quintana Redonda. A spectacular parking 1 km from the town, very well resolved, a lot of shade, lighting, bathrooms and shower at 1 euro. Impressive. For those of you who park here, in addition to consuming in the town -they deserve it- you can come to eat some spectacular torreznos at the Bar Soria de Tardelcuende (5 km), or have a good Gintonic at La Fragua"

Due to electricity problems in the village, we were unable to take a hot shower and the parking lot lighting went out. But soon after, someone came to restore it. If you are ultra sensitive to the nuisances of the countryside then do not try it because yes dogs bark ..... But at the same time when one seeks the countryside it is normal to have some ""animal disturbers."" The services are top notch and the locals very friendly. Nice stroll nearby in beautiful forests of oaks, firs and poplar nearby ..... Some will understand me in this December of me soft and very wet. For nature lovers who respect it"

102495,1917417,3,Vandiamo,26/05/2022,Warning! I wouldn’t attempt to access this if you are a heavy/long vehicle. There is a warning at the bottom of the hill to say no buses or lorries but we saw it too late. We are 9m & 5T and only just made it up. We were lucky when we got to the top that there was just one parking space left. Admittedly it is a quiet neighbourhood but a fairly busy road until the cars stopped at about 2am.
102495,1911051,4,ElloMorto,23/05/2022,"Relatively flat, free parking. Bins nearby. Not exactly paradise, but it'll do."
102495,1895763,4,anaispillet95,17/05/2022,be careful it climbs to get there! but once up there we found a place between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. it is better to go there during the spanish break. it's flat once at the top. 25 minutes walk from the historic center. we go through very cute streets.
102495,1884329,5,RVHpark,11/05/2022,Quiet street . Bus 8 or N9 nearby to the center. Plan your bus ride so you can avoid the steep climb. Perfect street parking space. Safe and quiet .
102495,1879029,5,Anairam,09/05/2022,Very quiet place. Street with many vans and motorhomes. 10-15 from the Albaicín. Highly recommended to be so close to the Albaicín and be so safe.
102495,1878918,5,paulam11,09/05/2022,"Flat spot 20 min walk to Granada centre - you won’t find a closer spot than this for free! Lots of other vans there too, no issues with security. Parking on the side of the road close to a sports field. We arrived Fri afternoon and got a spot easily, and friends arrived Sat night and also found a spot."
102495,1876292,4,ptcarlospt,07/05/2022,"We stayed 2 nights, little noise at night. It is possible to visit the sights on foot. I suggest entering the street from the south, access on a very narrow climb for those coming from the north."
102495,1861455,4,candiemassol,30/04/2022,Park on the street but quiet place and known to motorhomes. Bus station 5 min.
102495,1860732,4,Mike-44,30/04/2022,Please note: Parking prohibited for motorhomes in the parking lot of the sports complex.
102495,1853582,5,LuisinaD,26/04/2022,"Quiet area to spend the night, safe during the day. 20 min to Granada Cathedral. We arrived for the Night and there was space to park during the day it fills up."
102495,1839408,4,GodinoCamper,19/04/2022,calm. level. 10 minutes from the albaicin. usual overnight place. you usually see more campers.
102495,1812926,5,Dolcevita78,10/04/2022,"We have slept very well for two days, it is half an hour from the Alhambra and in the heart of Albarracín ... recommended"
102495,1810205,5,HarissonFord,08/04/2022,For travelers who prefer nature. This quiet area was perfect for visiting the city day and night. Calm without problem. Free. Thanks for the tips
102495,1800777,5,Chusitooo,30/03/2022,"I'm not a big fan of street parking, but considering the difficulties of parking near cities, it seems like a good place. It is a quiet area, at night there is hardly any traffic and it is very close to the Albaicín. I recommend."
102495,1797556,5,Tanathevan,27/03/2022,"Quiet place to spend the night, 20 or 30 minutes on foot from the tourist area of Granada. We arrived at night and found a place first time."
102495,1791699,4,RobyKnoerich,22/03/2022,"Good for visiting the city, but relatively crowded. Felt safe to leave the car though."
102495,1779161,4,Nathalie89,10/03/2022,"We spent 3 quiet nights here during the week. Close to the Albaicín area and 30 minutes walk to Alhambra. Quite a steep road to get to, so a decent climb even when walking back from the city. Waste sorting station in the street."
102495,1772891,3,KepaFurgo,04/03/2022,"Two-way street where you can park and spend the night on both sides of the road. We arrived around 8:00 p.m. and we could not park, because there is a sports center right next to it and there were many cars. We got back around 10pm and we already found a parking space. We spent 2 fairly quiet nights. It is located about 15 minutes on foot from Albaicin and 30 minutes on foot from the center."
102495,1766235,5,Gafax,26/02/2022,"quiet area, many places to park, little noise, we got up at 9. Quite a few people spending the night. We will repeat!"
102495,1761521,4,tobitobsen30,20/02/2022,"Good spot for visiting the city (10-15 minutes walk to Albayzin), spent 2 nights on the parking lot with a couple of other vans without any problems. Quiet at night, busy especially in the evening and mornings."
102495,1748021,1,JuliaRafal,05/02/2022,"You can only park in the two streets that cross: one is very steep and the other there is little space. In the parking lot of the soccer field there is already a sign prohibiting motorhomes, even so last night there were two but I didn't play it. I went to the field in front of the Padilla restaurant and very well."
102495,1725247,4,Setecentos,03/01/2022,"Quiet area to spend the night. Well leveled, easily accessible, in a residential area relatively close to the Albaicín and the Sacromonte. A pity that Granada does not have a motorhome area and we have to look for these spaces in peripheral neighborhoods."
102495,1725072,4,albertozzz,03/01/2022,Convenient parking both for visiting the city and for sleeping at night. the first time we passed there was no space and we parked nearby. Towards evening we returned and there was room. populated by cars and a few campers / vans.
102495,1724805,5,ABC999,03/01/2022,"Great location, very close to the Sacromonte and the Albahicín neighborhood, 10 minutes walk. There are not many places but it is worth trying. The way to get there, alright"
102495,1715476,4,Henskotho,25/12/2021,Easy access to the spot and only a short walk to the center. There are others parking lots in the area. They are closer but also on a steeper road.
102495,1703211,4,Maddeon,04/12/2021,"Free place to park. Not easy to find a place. Ideal for visiting the city as it is located 25min walk from the center. Quiet at night, and no problem for the CC."
102495,1701888,4,Herbstkind,02/12/2021,"We stayed here from Friday to Saturday. There was a lot going on because of a sporting event. However, that didn't bother us. About 10 minutes on foot to the beautiful old town. And 30 minutes to the Alhambra. We felt safe!"
102495,1698784,4,ichbinmatthias,27/11/2021,Free parking on even ground close to the center. Gets busy during sport events. Saturday Morning at 4am we got woken up by the noise of the rubbish collection. When coming from the west the road is very steep (callejon de lebrija).
102495,1696627,4,nuriaa93,23/11/2021,We were 3 nights super quiet and 25 minutes from the center on foot. Near the San Nicolàs viewpoint. Very good site and Safe
102495,1695920,2,sico14,22/11/2021,"It is good to visit the city and go out there, you can spend one night, but I do not think more (unless you have everything the same), since it does not have any type of service and it is a normal parking lot. Unless you have your own toilet. Free and very good location."
102495,1681846,4,DelaMay,07/11/2021,"Excellent place to park and spend the night, it is close to the Albaycin, Sacramonte and the center, leaving the end of the street to the left you go down to the traffic light and on the left is the Albaycin"
102495,1662630,4,vdanube,26/10/2021,"Quiet at night, places are full during the day but several available in the evening. close to the very safe university district. in the evening, sportsmen use the pitches above, so the noise of a ball until 10 p.m. super practical for visiting the city and the Alhambra."
102495,1641604,4,Franvito,12/10/2021,"We have done 3 nights, two of them in a row, it is a street with little car traffic, a quiet place, there is always a van or motorhome parked, 15 minutes walk from the Albaicín and about 25 minutes from the center."
102495,1589014,4,artg3,18/09/2021,"Generally a good place. Close to the booth center and the Albayzín district. Stood there for four nights and also during the day, everything OK. Cars pass by quickly at night and the lights are quite bright. Recommended for city tours and 1-2 nights."
102495,1483253,5,Nico4298,19/08/2021,"Thank you Parkfornight for this great spot. Right in the middle of a quiet residential area, we, like others, set down our van for the day to enjoy Granada. We fell in love with this ideal parking lot."
102495,1426996,4,Apablo1,09/08/2021,"We have spent two nights here to visit the city and without problem, yes, we have only been in the van just enough to sleep. The albaycin is a 10-minute walk away and you can reach the Alhambra and the center in half an hour."
102495,1409840,4,Leonardo4064,05/08/2021,"We slept very well for one night which is good. It should be noted, however, that trucks drive fast at night and that this woke us up because of the tremors caused on the van. It takes 30 minutes on foot to get to the center."
102495,1399809,4,felipebus,03/08/2021,Near the center and free. Good option to spend the night.
102495,1227051,4,bottier,30/05/2021,"We spent 3 days and 2 nights at this spot. No problem, quiet neighborhood close to albayzin! We felt safe. At the top to visit the city :)"
102495,1174142,4,mabaert,15/04/2021,Good spot near city center.
102495,1126889,4,stefansmink,02/01/2021,"Great spot to visit Granada. The parking area is nicely flat, which is not easy to find in Granada. It is a 20 minute walk to Granada city center and 30 minute walk to Alhambra.

I must admit, when you arive it does look a bit dodgy, just the general wellbeing of the area and the graffiti on the walls. But we stayed for 3 nights, always felt save and had no issues."
102495,1018392,5,Garyvalou,01/09/2020,Very good place to park for the day. Very good neighborhood. Not spent the night because the lake is 10min away but the street is quiet enough to sleep
102495,973690,4,Mbteam,17/08/2020,Very quiet and two pats from the old center
102495,777093,1,giulianotofani,07/02/2020,"We stayed two nights, but in the morning the police went by to tell us that you can't stay long, if one stays one night they pretend nothing but long stops don't."
102495,773213,4,Tomasvm,27/01/2020,"Parking online, very quiet and safe. Very close to the Albaicín neighborhood and about 20 minutes walk from Elvira Street."
102495,727557,4,garvig,22/10/2019,Good to visit Granada. Very calm district. Few places available.
102495,717628,1,aabuelo,10/10/2019,Next to drug neighborhood. Is not safe. They steal. Better with a new police station. 5 minute metro
102495,716722,5,r1a2u3l,09/10/2019,"A quiet place to sleep, we arrive on a street with a steep climb. The very quiet night"
102495,716085,5,vwt52006,08/10/2019,"Good place to spend a couple of nights, it is a very quiet place, the only thing that on Saturday night was heard background music noise, but very far from bothering to sleep. If we return to Granada, we will not hesitate to spend the night here again."
102495,691228,4,Elios59T,15/09/2019,"Very good location for 1 or 2 nights in a quiet area at the top of the Albaicin, 30 minutes walk from the Cathedral and the Alhambra."
102495,680525,4,Leon_Man,07/09/2019,"Was parked here allday to visit the city, car is safe, just climbing back is hard, but its good for your ass!"
102495,657170,4,lesstefs,24/08/2019,"Difficult access, it rises hard is narrow but I went with a 7.5m integral. Calm and safe parking, and very well placed to visit the center and 700 meters from San Miguel point of view not to be missed at sunset and for the view of the city. I stayed here for 2 nights including one alone. no problem is secure. Of course no service is parking?"
102495,506911,1,musicboy,07/06/2019,We stayed one night (Thursday) on the street as the sports carpark was full. Had to sleep with skylight open as it was so hot. The noise from passing traffic was intermittently loud all night. Very little sleep because of this and the carpark wouldn't have been much better. Definitely not a place for light sleepers. As for Granada? stray from tourist streets and its a graffitti blighted eyesore.
102495,502975,5,KaravanCamper,03/06/2019,"Quiet and flat place to park, without services"
102495,500635,5,ELS49,02/06/2019,We parked on the small parking lot of the sports complex for one night. quiet place and very well located for visiting the city (less than 10 min walk from the Mirador de San Nicolas). Possibility of parking with a camper on the street next to the parking.
102495,445662,4,brujulaescacharrada,28/03/2019,Quiet place to spend the night. In weekend something noisy for the day since there is a sports center next. Good place.
102495,416820,4,Lunatica66,28/12/2018,"Next to a sports center and quiet school to be holidays, some cars at high speed that yes, we slept one night without any problem. 900 m. from the Mirador de San Nicolás, also parked during the day."
102499,3204130,4,van5night,23/08/2023,"Nice, quiet parking space. At the back you can stand between the pine trees further ahead along the path. Short way over the dunes to the beach. Bad network on the pitch, but good on the beach. Spent a quiet night here. In August not as full as the two pitches in front of it."
102499,2755635,1,visaxel38,16/05/2023,"How to find this beautiful place??!! Weird people driving around, no view of the ocean, dirty papers lying around. I stayed there, without going far from my van, because it was late but I didn't die for the next morning…go somewhere else!!"
102499,2546195,5,ElCau,08/01/2023,"One of the most beautiful places where we have spent the night during this trip through Portugal, we did not see anyone and we were very calm. A few steps you have beautiful views of the sea. Surely it's not a good place in summer, but out of season it's great!"
102499,2359353,3,thijsterpstra,10/09/2022,You can park up to 50 meters from the beach
102499,2258486,1,FofiDav,17/08/2022,Run away!!! THIEVES!! A short walk (30 minutes max) on the beach was enough. They broke a window and robbed us. They have a hiding place on the heights in the groves.
102499,2130553,1,Nirvacid,27/07/2022,don't go there it's forbidden: forest rangers who take your identity in the morning
102499,1053386,1,ruivalente,17/09/2020,The spot was super crowded and we tried and transversal road. Our van got stucked and we had to ask for help. 5 hours later we took our cars safely
102499,1019585,1,Alexxxx,01/09/2020,"Top beach at the end of the road, on the other hand I parked under the buns that are along the path ... permanent passage of a single man in search of company ... after observation, a lot of condoms on the ground. therefore left.after turning in the area it is indeed the corner ..."
102499,992487,5,4goneta,22/08/2020,Quiet place where the only thing you hear is the sound of the sea and you don't have any kind of discomfort.
102499,768177,1,robinreems,13/01/2020,"Very dirty. A lot of trash. Many man alone, sitting in there car. Is this a secret meeting place? We left. (Off season)"
102499,738155,5,AleaDevinable,04/11/2019,Beautiful despite the weather in the rain. Plenty of parking possibilities to live in peace but given the weather and the season we were alone ^^
102499,685295,4,SolineRobin,10/09/2019,"Great place cut off from the wind during the evening (the wind falls in the evening), beautiful sunset between the trees. Different places of possible spots if ever several campers are present."
102499,657321,5,hippsea,24/08/2019,"Great spot! Stayed here with our van for two nights and it was wonderful! The place is shady under the pines and it only takes a minute to the beach. From a platform you can overlook the whole beach, but there is also access to go into the water. Only some other people around, mostly surfers. At night, we were all by ourselves. Highly recommended!:)"
102499,527964,2,ViagensDaquiParaAli,25/06/2019,"This place could be really nice because it has lots of shades and it's close to the beach. However, it's not recommended for families with children as there is quite a lot of prostitution in the area. We saw dozens of cars coming and going within the few hours we were there. They didn't bother us but it's strange being around so we left to Macedo beach really close which was much better."
102499,483246,5,tessthaine19,13/05/2019,"Stayed here last night, great spot very beautiful! We meet a local who said it is safe and fine to stay overnight here as long as you stay close to the pin drop location and don’t stay farther up the path.  At night was quiet but popular for surfers and local through the day.  The path to get in wasn’t too bad we were fine in our ford transit van wouldn’t suit motor homes . Otherwise such a peaceful night !!"
102499,398585,5,alexca2re,24/10/2018,"It was perfect ! ? Thank you for this beautiful location, not necessarily easy to access, but nice to spend a quiet night! The beach is 2 steps ..."
102525,1242042,4,MariaLosada,07/06/2021,"Some very cool beaches. very calm. Great to spend the day, to sleep I don't know (danger signs)"
102525,1224264,1,YetiCamper,29/05/2021,"We went there to stay the night, however there were 2 signs saying ""for work personnel only"" and ""dangerous area, dangerous fluctuations of water level"". We ended up looking for another spot to spend the night."
102525,973505,5,samur_ay,17/08/2020,"Very secluded, space for a single vehicle, but perfect for disconnecting. Without any service. Quiet night to rest."
102525,726437,5,boerni88,21/10/2019,Nice quiet place. Still very clean!
102525,718457,5,marthaan,11/10/2019,Amazing place! we slept well and had a wonderful view! We even took a swim in the river
102535,2645004,4,Tauro19,06/04/2023,a perfect and very quiet place. 100% recommended and close to the helmet.
102535,2448848,4,Jcevost,17/10/2022,"Very convenient for visiting Logrono, 15 minutes away with places in the shade but on the side of the road so too noisy for the night (on the edge of the Camino de Santiago)."
102535,2267459,3,vanbanana,19/08/2022,"We have spent one night in this spot. At night some car came to skid, but we got between two pine trees in the back to get shade in the morning. It has garbage, water sources and the river a few meters away. We slept peacefully and we liked it... We recommend it!"
102535,1638323,5,calibeach,11/10/2021,"Perfect parking, flat .10 'walk to the center."
102535,1525517,3,aldipa,29/08/2021,"We spent the day to visit the city, 10 minutes walking. but we did not sleep because of the comments and we went to the parking lot near the area. PHENOMENAL for the alternative that this city gives us. Thank you"
102535,797506,1,amoran,27/03/2020,In Logroño the best place is the parking lot of the wheels. There are always other ACs and it is the same distance from the laurel as this one. Knowing Logroño I would not sleep here alone. It is not a 100% safe site.
102535,788728,4,Carmengh,29/02/2020,"We parked with the idea of visiting the city and sleeping here, when we arrived at night there were kids' cars and in the end we went somewhere else. No light, gave a little respect since there was no other motorhome."
102535,750891,3,JuliaEtaMikel,07/12/2019,"Parking in front of the cemetery of Logroño. Ideal to visit the city, spend the night and be able to park the motorhome quietly, since the motorhome area is far away. There is a source of drinking water and some snacks next door. It is recommended to visit Laurel Street, a street with a very good atmosphere and very good skewers"
102535,684380,5,chisca,10/09/2019,"We have spent the night, super quiet!"
102535,634128,4,ILLAMOLA,16/08/2019,Well located and quiet. We spent 2 nights and no problem
102535,504263,4,retraite86,04/06/2019,Quiet parking without service but close to the old town. We are alone so the choice of place
102540,2938419,5,abgarciam,08/07/2023,Very familiar campsite. The owners are very nice. It is very well located on the island to move around. For electricity it is better to bring a cable of at least 25 meters. Showers and toilets clean and very correct. Bar with sandwiches and frozen water to take away. It is a very good option if you like family and simple camping. We would repeat.
102540,2353619,2,castor79,09/09/2022,"This campsite can be an alternative but it is very expensive given the very dirty general state of the toilets. 30 euros per night at the beginning of September! Not often hot water in the shower, no wifi, no hot water for the dishes… Admittedly, there is a small swimming pool. The camping car pitches are not delimited… everyone is in a large space like in a car park. Provide an electric wire of at least 25 meters because few terminals. Not really a service area. You have to pass between 2 trees near the buildings, the small pipe barely 3 meters long does not allow you to reach your vehicle, the emptying is done by placing an old container cut in half under your connected vehicle to a hatch through a pipe several meters long. In short, it's DIY and not very hygienic."
102540,1191709,4,25u.de,10/05/2021,"Family run campsite, out of season I only paid 13.70. Unfortunately the washing machine is defective (magnetic switch for fresh water and heating rod), that's why I actually came. Everything around the campsite is locked private property. That means you can't go for a walk there. You can't do anything there without a car / bike. Totally nice operators, are super nice!"
102540,464271,4,papoumette,22/04/2019,"Well. Very welcome, we stayed 4 days. Ideal to visit the west of the island."
102540,383185,5,hellasangel,27/09/2018,"Clean showers, spacious spots and friendly staff. They have two swimming pools, one for kids and one for adults. Beach is 5mins drive away, can’t go on foot but  it is possible with the bikes."

102609,1672594,3,dirkjeb,01/11/2021,"Quiet place to stay overnight. Drives a bit wrong (Saturday evening). Drinking water was not connected/tap did not work. Further, far from civilization."
102609,1620818,5,zerep1974,01/10/2021,A beautiful place very well cared for with drinking water of the best that I have visited.
102609,1489481,4,Jon.Klara,20/08/2021,"Perfect place to spend the night with many squares, full of trees that provide good shade. Nice wake up with playful squirrels. There are bins, fountains, swings and a picnic area, with barbecues, and even a small wood oven. Held on August nights, children's excursions go to see the Perseids."
102609,1296532,3,macabeo,04/07/2021,"Feels like 100 parking spaces in partial shade, found 2 (!) Tables with benches."
102609,1158942,4,Juanangarcia,27/03/2021,"Pretty good place to spend the day and spend the night. It has a lot of shade and water, there are bathrooms but they are closed. On the road many cars pass throughout the day but it is not annoying at all. I would say that on weekends young people go to make a bottle there, otherwise everything is perfect"
102609,519196,4,bereber,17/06/2019,"A place 2'7km from the town, with shade, fountains, spacious, ideal to leave the car and 2 'to get to the beginning of the PR-AB 40 hiking route - attention when traveling, because the signs are not well maintained, easy to get disoriented, although very cool landscapes to see. Paste: young people from the town who go at night with cars to drink leaving it dirty."
102634,2996143,3,ingrid99,21/07/2023,"Very quiet place, we spent the night but it made us a lot of air. The terrain is irregular with earth and stone. The views are very beautiful and an incredible sunset."
102634,2665906,3,AmetsakOporrak,12/04/2023,Good views. Bad level. It is advisable to arrive during the day to park well. no services

102634,2509412,3,karibuvan,30/11/2022,"Spot with a beautiful view and a quiet area at night but a lot of rubbish on the outskirts and it is also a spot where young people from the city come to rest. They knocked on our window to politely ask us for water to smoke. At this time, they don't stay long because it's cold, but I imagine that summer is different."
102634,2392164,5,veronicaleo,21/09/2022,"The best of the location the sunset !!! in a very quiet urbanization, you can hardly hear the cars, that is, there is no shadow right where you see the photos."
102634,2366268,3,AdriaPujolras,13/09/2022,"very nice place, pity that when we were going to sleep, two guys appeared who parked next to us and started making a scandal and yelling. We left there."
102634,1984828,5,DieMahlerts,17/06/2022,"Been there at the beginning of May: super quiet and large place! However, littered, please take your rubbish with you! Great view of reservoir/river. Caspe can only be reached by car, but there are two restaurants within walking distance."
102634,1829898,3,TomasLl,17/04/2022,"The spectacular place, it's a pity that at 2.00 am we had to leave because a group of young people with loud music settled next to the Fishing Museum."
102634,1781650,5,janarpru,13/03/2022,Arrived late and stayed a night with no problems. Views were great in the morning too. We were in a van but probably ok for a motorhome as well.
102634,1736980,4,cstikro,19/01/2022,We stayed a little further than the nautical base on the dirt road park very quiet and not too isolated beautiful view of the lake walk along the lake very pleasant
102634,1735832,5,coco3412,17/01/2022,corner with superb view. We stopped for lunch. Very calm . Possible to spend the night there. Not too isolated. Next to the nautical club.

102634,1316389,4,luiscarlospm,12/07/2021,"Quiet place, only the strong wind bothers a bit, but for the rest, spectacular views"
102634,1130997,4,Davidolas,16/01/2021,"We have not been right at this point due to strong wind. but 40 meters further on in an area with some trees before reaching the yacht club we were more collected and phenomenal. I pass the garbage truck and little else. Views to the sea of Aragon and little else, very quiet area."
102634,776071,4,citapel,04/02/2020,"Nice place for daytime, swimming, fishing. but overnight stay prohibited !!!"
102634,733918,2,dcrocket,30/10/2019,"Dirty, garbage, shit .... but nice look"
102634,683324,5,soysara,09/09/2019,We have spent a very quiet night next to the reservoir.
102654,2123820,3,MissL,25/07/2022,"Not to sleep. We arrived at night and with the same we went in search of a quieter place since this is next to the road. As day parking, perfect."
102654,1724215,3,Bernardette,03/01/2022,The site is flat with beautiful trails nearby. However it is close to the airport and not far from Girona. Plenty of traffic and airplane noise until late on January 2nd.
102654,1155183,5,gorka1,21/03/2021,"For us it has been perfect, we have spent the night alone, in the morning we have done a good walk. There are different routes of different levels to do. When we returned, the parking lot was full of cars that had come to do walking routes. At night you can do a good observation of the stars if it is clear. We give it 5 stars."
102654,436142,5,animon,04/03/2019,"We have spent one night here and it is a very quiet place, we have been alone. Only in the morning did people start to visit the volcano and some cyclists passing by."

102678,1618807,4,AttilaP,30/09/2021,"It's a quite place to spend the night. Awesome view in the morning and evening. Potable spring water nearby (at the bridge), you can also walk along the river and swim. I would not recommend this place for larger/longer motorhomes, as the access road is gravel, narrow and steep. But with a Campervan (e.g. Fiat Ducato) it's no problem."
102678,1535976,4,DianaetLaurent,01/09/2021,Spectacular view! Good surprise!

102706,2380756,1,DaiDai,17/09/2022,"It is impossible on weekends to park in this car park. All places are taken by cars. Especially for someone over 6m. Also pay attention to the GPS guidance, it tends to direct you to go through the center of the village."
102706,2280006,4,mimiponce,21/08/2022,Difficult-to-access parking for long camper vans and nasturtiums. We were lucky to find a place in the middle of the day. Next to the beach and the center. We didn't stay to sleep
