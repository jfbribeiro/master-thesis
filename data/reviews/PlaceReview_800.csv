21038,1975180,4,perropombo,14/06/2022,"A very quiet car park next to the Loyola sanctuary. It has no service, but nothing is paid either. The access is just behind the road that leads to the house of spiritual exercises. Parking with a little slope, very careful and clean. We have spent a very quiet night from Sunday to Monday. The only motorhome that was next to us seemed abandoned."
21038,1909126,4,Odrakir,23/05/2022,"We were trying to get to the other one nearby but we found a pivot blocking access so we stayed here. Quiet night: noise of dogs and reveling youth at the foot of the sanctuary, but acceptable. There are toilets nearby right in front of the Sanctuary (they close at night). The views of the Sanctuary illuminated at night incredible."
21038,1801622,4,Philpod17,31/03/2022,"Very calm night. Parking away from the road. Sloping though. Toilets at 100 m. The most difficult thing is to find the access. In high season, it is not sure that there is room."
21038,827773,4,AnaOrtega,18/06/2020,"We slept tonight, a beautiful place, a bidegorri to get to Azpeitia, all green surrounded by farmhouses, the Sanctuary and pleasant houses."

21038,178350,2,cecilequadra,18/08/2017,"Arriving before 8 pm on 3/08/17, I was able to find the only possible place for motorhome (6 m) quiet place once the customers of the hotel nearby arrived. Garbage cans, selective sorting at the entrance."
21038,162856,1,leslutinsdelaforet,01/08/2017,No room to accommodate a motorhome on this car park. You have to go back down to the car park (at 500 m)
21049,3243634,4,aprendemosporelmundo,31/08/2023,"Good place to spend the night, quiet despite being very busy. We were lucky enough to park right in front of a picnic table and be able to use it, but people brought out tables and chairs in a very discreet way. Nearby there are some very clean public toilets that cost €0.50. Next to the cable cars and the beginning of the walkway. Highly recommended."
21049,3242226,5,OttoyBruce,31/08/2023,"Ample parking to spend the night. We have slept with the roof up without problems. What you can't do is camp, although many people don't care and you can see chairs and tables. In parking lot A there is free drinking water."

21049,3086970,4,mycool,06/08/2023,"Large parking area in the chairlift area. Some unevenness and little shade but it has small picnic areas and is not noisy at all. Lots of civility and education. Hiking routes leave from the same parking lot as well as the chairlift and the tourist train. The area for emptying and filling water is in parking lot A, as is the public bathroom. Good area to spend a nice weekend"
21049,2999774,2,roguyxx,21/07/2023,"A place without more… few shades, some picnic table. You can stay overnight... be careful if you take out chairs and tables... they are denouncing"
21049,2984730,1,juole,18/07/2023,"It's place itself is fine. There is no shade but it is fairly level. Now, don't even think of breaking any of the rules or parking anywhere else in town. They fined us for having a bucket of water outside with our clothes on, not even water fell on the ground. The day before, the civil guard fined some neighbors because they were with the awning and chairs out, up to that point I agreed, but later they went all over the parking lot looking for any infraction to fine the owners."
21049,2960377,3,pimpelb,13/07/2023,many parking spaces and possibility to fill and empty water and a toilet for 0.5 €. Near the village.
21049,2846157,5,Vilamajor1980,12/06/2023,"Very quiet car park and ideal for visiting the area, we have been there 2 nights and they have been very quiet, together with about 15 vehicles spending the night. Many thanks to the town of Panticosa, when we visit the area again we know where to spend the night. We used all the emptying and filling water services and they are great, they are very practical and comfortable (located in the parking lot above)"
21049,2688613,3,BelaPetra,22/04/2023,In spring the pitches are big enough because it's empty. There is a nice path to the next village. Couldn't fill up with water because there's no separate hose for the cassette and no option to connect your own.
21049,2606601,4,arconadag,12/03/2023,Quiet and with space. The noise from the river is a bit annoying at first.
21049,2563775,5,KikoSuarez,29/01/2023,"Parking for the ski resort, but an area for motorhomes. there is a flat part and another that is slightly inclined, it is large and you have all the services at the entrance of the parking lot. There are bars next to the parking lot and 5 minutes from the town center."
21049,2475959,5,MoisesM,01/11/2022,"Place with all the necessary services, gray water, black water, filled with drinking water, laundry, toilets, litter bins... the truth is that it is very well equipped next to the access to the slopes. Eye depends on the area there is a little inclination but nothing serious. Recommendable !!"
21049,2403108,4,Rolo1,25/09/2022,"Handy motorhome to walk Pasarelas de Panticosa. You can easily spend the night here and also empty and fill water nearby on the other side of the river, even wash your camper. There's no bridge, the roof won't work. In Panticosa several bars and restaurants. out of season not everything is open. if it snows or freezes beware, the driveway is steep so you don't get up there!"
21049,2307449,5,Pocoflou,27/08/2022,"Very good place. Next to the town. Please, let's respect all the rules they put, to be able to continue using it."

21049,2277540,5,Anima_viatgera,21/08/2022,"A charming place, with a beautiful waterfall next to the area, in addition, many exclusive sites for motorhomes and campers. The town is very nice for a walk."

21049,2088566,5,Viajandoencamper,18/07/2022,"Near the river, squares on the flat, the bad thing is that there is hardly any shade but sleeping with that landscape is worth it. Nearby you have the chairlift to go up or the route of the footbridges."

21049,1960361,5,armintanzanian,09/06/2022,"very quiet parking of the ski station, I have been in winter and summer, skiing and visiting its mountains many times, in winter it is very busy, it is better to arrive towards the end of the day to get a place because during the day it is practically impossible. outside the ski season without any problem. 2 mins walk from the town, it has gray water drainage."
21049,1903931,5,AlbaCantera,21/05/2022,"Right at the station, upstairs there are bathrooms."
21049,1776763,3,jaimegpuente,07/03/2022,"It was an ideal place until the bad smell led me to the river, at the height of the bridge, and with an astonished face I saw how sewage was poured directly into the river!!! Amazing"

21049,1705962,4,fiveonroad,08/12/2021,Good area to stay. Very close to everything. The bad thing is that the entrance is only one lane for both directions. Do not arrive or leave at rush hour when the station is open. It's chaos. .
21049,1671781,5,delolmo.ivan,31/10/2021,Perfect place to spend the night. Very calm. Totally recommended. Near the village! We were together with 6-7 other motorhomes.
21049,1670486,4,Mssmaris,31/10/2021,"Spent a couple of nights here. Has access to some trails, but in comparison to other locations in Spain, not something special. Parking lot has accommodated over 40 campers while we parked there and felt safe. No services and little town offers a variety of bars and a small supermarket."
21049,1647515,4,Uribecosta,16/10/2021,"Now there is a free gray and black water emptying service, and water intake. You can also wash your car with a coin-operated car wash hose. Everything in perfect condition."
21049,1623547,5,NoaArlandis,03/10/2021,"A perfect place to sleep. There is parking for motorhomes, if the parking below is full there is another quieter parking upstairs next to the ecopark. There are no public services. The super beautiful landscape and next to the chairlift. Many routes leave from there. Love it!!"
21049,1614132,5,SiraQuiroga,28/09/2021,"Parking in the parking lot next to the picnic area, level ground, very quiet, you sleep with the sound of the river. 3 great nights on this date at least. Service area at the entrance next to the cable car and containers, you can fill up with water and clean the toilet, it seems that they are adapting for car washing in the drainage area."
21049,1541037,5,WanderWebb,02/09/2021,"Plentiful parking, very quiet at night and near to the lovely town. We stayed the weekend of the Valle de Tena trail run competition and Parking Area C was closed for some reason- this caused the other parking places to be very very crowded. The only thing this place is lacking is services, but the town is nearby and Sallent de Gallego is just up the road. Will definitely return. Thanks for having us, Panticosa."
21049,1532257,4,chikiguti,30/08/2021,"We arrived late in the afternoon, the motorhome parking was closed, we found a place to spend the night well, the next morning that was a hive of AC, Campers and cars, I do not understand why they do not open the next parking lot. access to the cable car, the beautiful town, the incredible environment. easy access and somewhat inclined parking, chocks were needed."
21049,1503695,4,Salonica39,23/08/2021,"Good place to spend the night. Nothing more. Town near and surrounded by all routes, chairlift, etc…."
21049,1495440,3,Sanxz44,22/08/2021,"Well, as always, the more touristy the worse. In theory, parking C is the one enabled for AC, but some of us park wherever and however they please. The parking lot is inclined. It has no services, it is only a parking lot where they allow you to sleep. We got on the Tourist Train and walked down. For one night it is fine, for more nights I would find another place."
21049,1491892,1,verano21,21/08/2021,"We were in a parking lot to the less right at the entrance of the town. The civil guard arrived at 8 in the morning and informed all of us who had been doing the night that we should come to this place (the only authorized one in town). Very noisy, under construction in the AC area, without shade. we did not spend the night."
21049,1490135,5,AlfaruVan,21/08/2021,"There are two car parks, the one in the back indicated for motorhomes. It has no services. I give it 5 stars because we have spent the night quietly and because the town is close by with all the services."
21049,1488550,4,Xiju,20/08/2021,"Quiet place to spend the night. We have spent two fabulous nights, in silence and accompanied. It has no services. Even so, the town is very close for everything you need."
21049,1486119,4,IBueno,20/08/2021,"There are two parking lots, the one with the smoother bottom and for AC, the first is for cars and uneven. Near the village and quiet, a small playground with tables. There is no service of any kind, which before there was at least water ..."
21049,1482471,3,palomita,19/08/2021,"The parking to sleep this mb, the area did not have any service and in the end it is all the same. There are usually a lot of people but it is quiet"
21049,1482461,4,Juliaapa,19/08/2021,"Good place to spend the night, quiet and surrounded by nature. The town two minutes walk. It is small but if there is no space there is a large parking lot in front where they also park vans and acs"

21049,1381754,3,brachychitum,30/07/2021,"The area is very good, I do not put more stars because it does not have water service, nor filling, nor emptying of gray and / or black. Actually, the part reserved for motorhomes is parking lot C, much straighter. In the photos you can see the car park that is there before."
21049,1358767,4,superkapri,24/07/2021,"Unbeatable place, area with tables."
21049,1319189,4,Miquimera1975,13/07/2021,Parking where they let you spend the night. Good place to visit the town and go on excursions.
21049,1301615,4,anaranjada,06/07/2021,"Parking very close to the town, next to the river. It does not have loading or emptying services, but the site is still very good. First you enter a car park, and then you have to cross a bridge to get to the AC."
21049,1299148,3,ammolero,05/07/2021,"Good place to spend the night on the edge of the town, with the river and a magnificent picnic area next to it. It took us a bit to find it because you have to cross a very narrow bridge and we did not see it at first"
21049,1293566,4,albarnipe,03/07/2021,Next to the river. Ideal to visit the town. It has a great picnic area.

21049,1072615,5,Eli_Jose,27/09/2020,"Parking at the Panticosa ski resort where overnight stays are allowed. It is very large and divided into 3 zones, the AC zone is zone B but since everything is empty (the ski resort is closed) we stay in the upper zone (the widest one)."
21049,1068150,3,Bei-k,24/09/2020,Very quiet place in September. We were only 4 AC and the parking lot is quite large. You can hear the river but it didn't bother us. It is free but has no services. It was good to spend a quiet night near wonderful routes

21049,917253,3,Bobalong,01/08/2020,"Lovely little town. Good super market and a nice restaurant and pizza place.                                  However, there is no water, quite an uphill walk to town to a fountain, but at least it’s doable.  PLEASE PLEASE everyone. Stop pouring grey water into the drain. It is there but it goes straight into the poor river. I have even watched some people put there black water down there. So SAD. There are proper facilities in Sabiñánigo, 25 mins down the road.  Or carry an extra cassette!  We will all be sad when Panticosa puts a two metre barrier up:("
21049,896061,5,angeloojg,25/07/2020,"Nice place. with plenty of room for ac and campers, it is just past the point on an esplanade. the day we arrived there were about 20 motorhomes and campers ... super quiet. 2 min from the town passing a nice bridge. Great to spend a day in summer or in winter!"
21049,895947,5,angeloojg,24/07/2020,Incredible especially at night
21049,889191,1,Pimcakes,22/07/2020,"Really not terrible, a dozen places that could be nice but in touch. otherwise for the rest a large parking lot without interest. We preferred to leave."
21049,879457,3,pacoke,19/07/2020,"We have spent a July night, logically out of the ski season, so quite calm. We were only about 10 BC. It has no greywater and chemical toilet facilities that I have seen. Neither did filling clean water, I think. Just to say that 2 rivers pass around the parking lot, the one on the side of the town under a beautiful Roman bridge, is a river where all the sewage from Panticosa goes (unfortunate). On the other side a beautiful river passes where you can bathe in summer. You can walk to town in a moment"
21049,846555,1,jupersan,03/07/2020,"The tap is broken, the city council could fix this to improve this place, every time I come worse"
21049,785948,1,Leyre77,24/02/2020,"Just emptying grays, and no more service. Very fair to park if the parking lot is full of cars."
21049,784359,5,CanKerberus,22/02/2020,"Good place, the river is heard in the background, in the morning people are beaten to climb tracks there are better level places than others"

21049,760998,3,VILNARJA,31/12/2019,"Quite crowded area in ski season, quite precarious services and normally occupied by skiers cars that park in the drainage area. Better to arrive when the afternoon falls, there are more places. Good to spend a night and approach the slopes."
21049,754695,4,orangehalls,18/12/2019,Perfect location. And it's great that the Aire is free because considering its location. Plenty of spaces. Very calm in the night and we slept very well. The noise of th river was quite soothing. I don't understand why some people are shocked at the raw sewage when there is actually a sign saying it is discharged there. Obviously it's a huge shame but we didn't see any. Only a slight smell.
21049,752753,4,victorAst,11/12/2019,Perfect for water recharge. We have not seen where to discharge the sewage
21049,749434,5,63petete,02/12/2019,Very good for skiing a few days. I don't know if there are services because I didn't need it
21049,732875,3,Txavito,29/10/2019,"There is no treatment plant !! Emptying here is throwing it directly into the river. Do not empty It can be done in the Jaca area and I don't know if there is another emptying area in Sallent, although I doubt that it has a treatment plant"
21049,721035,1,Xarifa,14/10/2019,When I heard and saw the sign that all the grey and black waters of the parking and the village goes directly in the clean and idyllic river I could not believe that this is happening in a civilized European country. A shame! I will avoid this village in further journeys and make this public!
21049,701751,1,rufach,23/09/2019,"Shameful that there are still places without debuggers! Workers who have been cutting grass for 3 hours, from 12 a.m. to 3 p.m., at the end of September, with a golf course mower. There is no lawn to work 3h! Goshoes of camper camper people in the playground, and others continuously raining. Of course, we DO NOT advise the site, and we will not return. What a misfortune ..."
21049,680585,3,afineta,07/09/2019,Comfortable area but they have to put well to discharge waters .... I think it goes to the river (amazing)

21049,626830,3,horitzons,14/08/2019,"Ski area parking with overnight area, with a picnic table with two tables and a small playground. We have spent the night with several ACs and campers. It is next to a river, which cannot be bathed. The area smelled a little bad, either by the river or because the picnic area had certain dog droppings without picking up. We have seen a small tap although it is not very enabled to use. Very close to the town!"
21049,607899,3,31490,07/08/2019,It helps out well because difficult to find something in the corner. The advantage is that the parking is very large so we can isolate and access to the city is direct. Not tested yet at this time but it seems very active :)
21049,575719,1,vitonature,25/07/2019,In the end they will prohibit the overnight.
21049,575527,2,titomon,25/07/2019,"It will be a good place to do routes and others, but we have left due to the bad smell of the river, people ""nature lover"" pouring gray waters (and surely more than one black) in a sewer that goes directly to the River. That is not a download point !! It is for parking drainage !! And well, we also saw the typical ""I cross taking 3 parking spaces with my awning outside."""

21049,441046,5,gordicar,17/03/2019,"Perfect parking to be with the van! thank you Panticosa! what does not seem so perfect is, as always, the little environmental education that people have. In the tap where the sewer is, it clearly states that we are in a motorhome area and that if the gray / black water is thrown away, they will go directly to the river. Well nothing, there are still people ignoring."
21049,436600,3,croozer,05/03/2019,"Please, edit the information. It is an authorized parking for overnight without services of Motorhome area. The terminal could not be put into active because the wastewater goes directly to the riverbed. An ecological crime is being committed when emptying gray and black waters. If not respected they will end up closing the parking lot overnight. There is a motorhome area in Sabiñánigo and in Jaca."

The bad odors are regular and important, we see that the flow ends with a pipe that pours directly into the torrent below where the afternoon even a group of five young bathed despite a ban sign . Wastewater treatment is ?????"

21049,317951,3,enmarcha,06/08/2018,Comfortable area in the middle of ski resort at the foot of the slopes. The place of emptying is very precarious (just a hole in the ground) and the water intake is submerged. What is incredible is that the emptying area discharges directly into the river 15 m below by a pipe. The gray water should be purified. I do not know if the sewage is also poured directly into the river (I hope not).

21148,1811083,2,Pasacito,08/04/2022,"Seville is well worth it. Connection with bus to the center (nº28). For the rest, the parking lot is very deteriorated and neglected. That everyone values it (another evaluation is not understandable, or is it that whoever qualifies it in another way has not been there)"
21148,1801566,5,piscomiguel,31/03/2022,"Very good, quiet, easy access and accessibility."
21148,1799817,4,ronjawanderlust,29/03/2022,"At first the place is a bit off, as it is also a parking space (inside). But at the back there is an outdoor area that is really okay. Noise exists but is acceptable. Especially at night there are no/hardly any planes and trains are very rare. Safe place to visit Seville. We stayed 2 nights and paid €24, so €12 per night. Nice personel."
21148,1790258,3,oldman65xxl,21/03/2022,Safe place to visit Seville. Have slept peacefully. Getting into the city by bus is not a problem. Disposal in the hall. Attention no drinking water. Very friendly and helpful staff. With the APP MOOVIT you can find out the departure times and bus lines.
21148,1785661,3,marieinspiringexplorers,17/03/2022,"Very convenient to visit Sevilla, you always have someone watching over the fenced parking (inside and outside spots). But it’s literally on the highway, close to the train tracks and to the airport so there’s a lot of noise and it’s not really what you could qualify as a lovely place. If you’re visiting Sevilla, there’s a bus stop right in front of the parking so very very convenient once again."
21148,1777864,4,fan_chuan,09/03/2022,"A good place to visit Seville. Everything is there what you need, the sanitary area is not new but clean and can be used, no place to vacation there but very safe. If you have good earplugs you can sleep peacefully. Very friendly staff. Bus connection is great, the terminus is where you should start the city tour."
21148,1772555,3,Poirot1,03/03/2022,Not much choice in sevillia to find a decent motorhome. Now this motorhome location has an advantage with just at the door you can take bus 28 to place de Espagne. 15 euros with elec period March. Unfortunately you have to take train and plane
21148,1764142,3,olivier300,23/02/2022,"It is a stabilized earth ground, bus and shopping center next door, powerful shower, very hot, admittedly a bit expensive for the location. Earplugs recommended, train, plane, but not too much choice!!!"
21148,1760037,1,roger.dam,19/02/2022,a pure scam it's shameful to have us ripped off the way 1 motorhome a motorcycle trailer 21€ knowing that we don't exceed 15m 1€ the shower or you have to cross the entire parking lot of the land to complete and on one lane aerial and next to the trains the top I am very angry
21148,1757150,3,sirralle,16/02/2022,Ok place close to the city and with toilets and showers .. noise from airport and train but it manages to be quiet at night
21148,1755999,3,anxodio,14/02/2022,"Good to visit Seville without worrying too much and without being too far away. When leaving (5:30 p.m.) they told us that we had to leave before 3:00 p.m. and that it was an extra euro for each hour... We did not have loose change and you cannot pay by card, we had to walk to an ATM for 3 euros... ."

21148,1742666,4,doume61,28/01/2022,"for the price of 13 euros per night with electricity, free WiFi, it is guarded 24 hours a day, that's correct. The bus passes right in front and takes you to the center in 15 minutes, there is also a supermarket just opposite, footbridge to access. The staff is friendly"
21148,1740557,2,UrSch58,24/01/2022,"Space is mainly used for setting up mobile homes. Only a few places available to stay overnight. It can be tight for large vehicles. No drinking water. We drove on, not a nice parking space."
21148,1737238,4,Rick.,19/01/2022,"Not a pretty place, but guarded and safer than the parking lots in the city. You can stay the next day until 3 p.m., each additional hour costs one euro more. Toilets are clean, shower we did not use. Lots of trains passing by and planes flying over. Bus 28 stops directly in front of the location and goes twice every 15 minutes, so no waiting time. This costs €1.40 per ride."
21148,1736780,3,lilmonsta,19/01/2022,"It is a pavilion where the people of Seville keep their motorhomes and in the patio they let you sleep. It is guarded 24 hours with cameras and a person. Emptying and filling. Electricity €3. Shower €1. Bus to the center 10 meters. Supermarkets 5 minutes away. Cons: train track 5 meters away and planes above to land (both stop passing between 0:00 and 5:00) Still, the best option in Seville"

21148,1731069,2,OttoKurt,09/01/2022,"By friendliness I mean something else, but it's all a matter of opinion. This parking space is for maybe 15 motorhomes but then it gets really tight. The alleged 100 parking spaces are all completely occupied with motor homes, caravans and boats. Furthermore, the place is completely blocked. Stayed 2 nights but doesn't have to be there again. Not for long vehicles."
21148,1728448,3,Plaeuskadi,07/01/2022,"simple, sandy ground and somewhat noisy from planes and trains. just enough to spend the night and visit the city. good toilets and showers and loading and unloading area. guarded all the time and bus right at the door to Seville for 1.40 very frequently"
21148,1725790,4,albertozzz,04/01/2022,"Comfortable but very bad place, enough to temporarily depress the soul. But perhaps because we have seen it at its worst: with fog and many parked caravans, almost all with no one inside. Unpaved terrain, good cost, we didn't have to go to the supermarket on the other side of the ring road, and freight trains didn't bother us at night."
21148,1721912,3,Rulad,01/01/2022,"Unpaved ground, very simple, the power supply unstable. The night's sleep is interrupted by passing trains. Earplugs could help. Good bus connection to Seville"
21148,1718648,3,sabual,29/12/2021,"Advantages: security, the nearby bus stop and the Carrefour and Mercadona services opposite Cons: the train tracks are attached to the parking lot so, especially the freight trains, make a lot of noise. Also close to the airport and the ground is dirt so if it rains it is a nuisance and dirt for the AC"

The bath is 1.00 euros for the person, 5.00 for the car and 3.00 euros for electricity. They do not accept credit cards."

If you are hooked on the train tracks but very little happens at dawn, we do not need connections since where we were going was a 10 minute walk so the situation for us was ideal."

The bus (28) runs every 9 minutes during the day. It's tight but clean and it's not a campsite after all. To visit the city TOP. Don't be frightened by the entrance to a hall. That's right and to the square it goes THROUGH the hall into the open.
21148,1626466,4,pttrading12,04/10/2021,"Convenient spot to explore Seville, good value. Not pretty, but practical. During summer the outside spots would be very, very hot. 
Shower and toilet relatively clean, grey and black water disposal. The bus stops right outside the door, takes around 20min into the city. A bike lane starts a few hundred meters past the supermarket, 40min to town."
21148,1613835,2,la_balte,28/09/2021,"Indeed, it is just a parking area with a large hangar at the entrance. near a railway track and in an airplane corridor, it is quite hectic but at night the traffic is less dense. the toilets are at the entrance to the hangar. the shower € 1 but unlimited. the ladies' toilets do not lock and are still not clean. plan on cash, no credit card."
21148,1600988,3,JoseAledo,23/09/2021,"Area ideally located for the visit of seville, the wifi is random, the railroad along the area and the planes which pass above remind us that we are close to the 4th largest city in Spain.

In the covered area they are 10e if you stay overnight, if instead it is to spend the day they charge you 5e for 5 hours and from now on each hour that passes is 1e more (it does not make sense but it is). We stayed for 9 hours and paid 9e. It has to empty gray and black and fill with water.

21148,1366159,2,channetleoonthemap,26/07/2021,"We are disappointed given the previous reviews. You have to pay extra for the shower in addition to the 10 € parking. The price of the shower is not noted on the invoice which gives rise to questions. In addition, you also have to pay for water because there is no drinking water service which is also surprising. Positive point safety and next to Seville."

21148,1149359,1,lmrequile,09/03/2021,"We only took the shower there. We were charged 3 euros per person for a shower. Shower with cold barely broken after waiting more than 30 minutes. The boiler was plugged in when we arrived. For us this is really not correct. A word of advice, before paying, check that the water is hot. Because after payment the person disappears or ignores you."
21148,1148454,4,RudyBrink,07/03/2021,"Super good, simple location where your belongings are very safe. From here we went into town by bus for a day and by motorbike for a day. Administrators here are super friendly. Recommended to check the city."
21148,1145323,4,CecileVincentPao,02/03/2021,"It's not glamorous. Railway track expressway and air corridor. € 10 to visit Seville with peace of mind. Very warm welcome. Good feeling of this short stay despite the unwelcoming environment. Bus 28 in front (Terminus to Terminus, € 1.40 PP and per trip). Or 1 hour walk. Or 25min by bike on the cycle path (pass the Passerelle, cross Carrefour then cycle path). I recommend"
21148,1141278,3,PhilippeetFrancoise,23/02/2021,"Don't be proud of the first impression. Caravan and motorhome storage, secure place, you leave with peace of mind to visit Seville. Excellent for 1 or 2 nights. Quiet at night. A bit pricey but you won't find better in the area and the boss knows it."
21148,1133845,4,Spenox,30/01/2021,"It is not a welcoming place, it mainly does caretaking for motorhomes. You are installed outside, beware the ground must be muddy on rainy days. I put 5 stars because very secure and well placed for visiting the city but if you arrive at night the first impression is special."
21148,1129917,4,Javieg,11/01/2021,"Ideal place to see Seville in winter or summer to be able to leave the van indoors and be guarded It has a bus stop at the door that leaves you in the center of the city in fifteen minutes And across the road there is a mercadona, carrefour, laundry and several stores The very good price for 10 euros and the very attentive staff Everything perfect!"
21148,1124181,5,JiriF,26/12/2020,Very safe parking lot for motorhomes. It was guarded 24/7 by guards and CCTV. The guards were very helpful. Close to the bus and supermarket. The driveway into the outside parking lot was relatively narrow so we had little problems getting through with a 8.5m motorhome. It was next to a railway so there was some noise but I didn't think it to be a huge problem. Super safety overall.
21148,1119745,4,ALandDM,06/12/2020,Perfect to visit Sevilla with a safe mind knowing that your camper is under surveillance ! Basic for the rest. The bus stops in front of the park and within 20 min you are in the center ! we also had to pay €2 because we left after 3pm
21148,1114157,5,Robilirob,10/11/2020,"The best you can find if you want to visit the city ad secure your vehicle.
10 euro is okay for this service plus bus in front, toilet and everything"
21148,1107690,4,Roadtripspain,27/10/2020,"Don’t be put off when you draw up to this place. Very good service, the guys there are very helpful, it’s very safe as it’s got 24hr cameras with a guy on duty all night. All the services you need and even better the bus stop for central Sevilla is right outside the door !"
21148,1093950,5,ZAZACACHOU,15/10/2020,"I RECOMMEND ! Very friendly staff who gave us directions to the bus. Handed over a map of Seville with marked The arrival stop of the bus. Parking nickel. clean sanitary facilities. Stuck between the bypass and the railway track it is true, but very little noisy in fact! I slept very well. 13 euros plus 3rd electricity. 1st the shower. No complaints. Just missing washing machine."
21148,1082136,5,steph120442,05/10/2020,"The staff is friendly, the showers are quite clean, it takes 20-25 minutes to reach the city center by bus."
21148,1079298,4,Evelyn25,02/10/2020,Everything you need in a city. By bike about 25 minutes to the center. Very nice and helpful staff.
21148,1075610,5,AndhuaN14,29/09/2020,We stayed for 3 days. With toilet and shower 1 eur. Just to sleep . Line 28 passes through the door that leaves you in the center of Seville. The guys are very attentive and friendly
21148,993150,5,Tichigp,22/08/2020,"We were in the outdoor parking lot, flat squares and we were able to rest at night. The bus stop is right outside the door, you have to change to get to the center. The staff was nice and the toilets and showers are clean"

A parking lot to return"
21148,977976,4,kilibf,18/08/2020,"We have only spent one night and we choose outside, with this heat it is better to choose interior, it will also make less noise from trains. The bathrooms are immaculate and the staff is very friendly and helpful."
21148,960588,2,franckdouaud,14/08/2020,"Parking, non-potable water, unpleasant staff, arrived at 6:00 p.m. and left at 4:00 p.m. the next day, the guard asked me for 2 € more for departure after noon, I don't recommend !!"
21148,904947,5,chally,27/07/2020,Good place to leave the motorhome and visit the city quietly. Bus that takes you to the center at the parking gate. Arriving at any time you can be until 3pm the next day for € 10.
21148,792062,4,Phantom31,07/03/2020,"For the moment it is the ideal place, the noise ... certainly the trains but it is acceptable and there are few. But above all it is secure !!! In addition a bus passes at the foot of the site (the 28) no need of schedule they are very frequent. In short ! Convenient to land and so go see Seville. Above all, don't forget to go see the Torre Sevilla and go up to the watchtower."
21148,790468,3,Domi38,03/03/2020,"Average parking area, but it's a bit complicated to find better in Seville, it's noisy (train, plane and highway) here no drinking water but there are services"
21148,786821,3,Aleco,26/02/2020,"After reading all the comments of the other car parks in the city (broken windows, lots of stealing...) we decided that option who turns pretty well especially because you have the bus 28 that takes you right in the center in 20 mnts with a good frequency (every 5/10 mnts, 15/20 on sundays, 1,40€ per way for adults and kids too!! Cheaper if you buy a multi-way card & it brings you back on the other side just in front the huge Carrefour market!)The place is ok, efficient, safe, but can get full easily, call before if high season! By the way phone above is wrong, it’s 955956632. Clean shower & WC, hot shower can be gone quickly! Go early or late evening, it’s 1€. Overall for 10€ it’s good (without electricity), but the water is not drinkable !! Train passing sometimes and planes but it’s not that bad. You stay outside on dirt (not great if raining , watch out) not inside the garage (it’s for long term rentals camping-cars)(by the way for info the petrol station just before you enter is one of the cheapest: 1.129€/l on 23/02/2020!)"
21148,780659,3,fanbelle,15/02/2020,"Coming from Granada put the following address: callé jose Jesus Garcia diaz, Seville, stay on the service road pass in front of the san pablo crossroads and at the next roundabout go right on the service road on the other side of the national .1.5km on the right written on a large 24 hour camping shed This is it! for 13 € a flat space and electricity. clean shower toilet € 1. Nice boss!"
21148,768285,3,camp12345,13/01/2020,Stayed here 1 night as at a function in Seville and needed our dog to be safe . Not pretty but functional . Please take staff .  Bus outside or taxi 13 euro into Seville . Very secure . You park very close to other vans but with no problem . Beware of the cat . It scratched me !
21148,760430,3,Miniake,30/12/2019,"A good place to get by. Although it has water, electricity, etc. They are quite deficient in infrastructure. We traveled on Dec 28. and they put us at the bottom encased, with no possibility of light. Although ""it was the last hole"" they told us, the next morning we found 3 more ACs behind ours, 1 of them blocked our exit. All for pasta! They are not real 24h. It does not matter when you arrive, that the departure time is 15h. If you arrive later they charge for an extra hour"
21148,758812,3,nadchrist,29/12/2019,Good for visiting Seville. Secure parking.
21148,757349,4,juscha,27/12/2019,"Not nice, but very practical. Super nice and helpful staff. Also right next to the tracks for sleeping."
21148,757163,3,Eribatrafic1989,26/12/2019,"Definitely the safest and most convenient place to visit Seville. However do not have great expectations: it is a hangar and a vacant lot, questionable hygiene, railroad right next to it lined with a highway. Bus 28 will take you to the city center in 15 minutes. The reception is very friendly."
21148,754742,4,nono49,18/12/2019,"Well guarded area, provide cash for payment because no VSE."

21148,750878,4,Dobbythevan,07/12/2019,"Great spot! We were looking for a safe spot to be able to visit Sevilla. This place is the best. It’s 10€/ night. 3€extra if you need electricity and 1€ for a shower. I did take one but wouldn’t recommend it because the water isn’t that warm and the place is a big storage place so it was quite cold. You can also empty your black water and toilet and refill water. The whole place is monitored with cameras and the crew is very nice. We asked for a spot inside. The bus stop is right in front of this place and takes you to the center of Sevilla in 15 minutes and costs 1,40€ pp. would definitely recommend it!! We stayed two nights. Very calm and safe."
21148,749120,4,vincentzw,01/12/2019,"1 Dec, 12 euro inclusief shower for two. Bathroom clean enough and Carrefour Supermarket other side of the street. Pretty okay as silent enough also"

The person who welcomed us gave us a description of what to see in Seville. very convenient with the line 28 and the night A8 has 30 minutes of place of Spain for showers I can not say anything because I use my bathroom in the cc ..... so without hesitation go there it better than having the DC broken
21148,742037,4,TheUglyCamper,11/11/2019,"Highly recommended. It’s not glamorous as the pictures suggest but it’s secure, quiet and the staff are friendly. The location is ideal for getting into Seville and the shower facilities are modern and very clean. The only slight issue is that the water isn’t potable so be sure to fill up before you arrive."
21148,738069,3,paqt1977,04/11/2019,"Good place to sleep for sure. Good attention . Train noise, as it is next to the tracks. But they don't happen overnight. Carrefour and Mercadona across the road. Bus stop at the same door to go downtown Seville. 15 min. Recommended"

21148,686060,4,mickpamg,11/09/2019,"This dusty paid stop with a railway line running next door, the freeway out the front and an airport 5 kms up the road is actually OK.  The services are a dogs breakfast but they do work in a fashion.  The managers are nice enough but language is another issue.  However it has electricity which is a must to run your air-conditioner as Seville is as hot as hell.  There is an excellent Carrefour over the walking bridge.  The 28 bus takes you to the centro for €1.40 pp and drops you back for another €1.40.  The bus is every 15 minutes or less.  All in all a city stop with good security was what we wanted and received."
21148,667132,5,Gonesurfing999,29/08/2019,"We stayed here for 1 night. Shower and toilet very clean, easy and cheap bus service to the centre of town which runs late into the night. Friendly staff, a great place to stay"
21148,643615,4,Patrik11,19/08/2019,We are very satisfied. For a reasonably low price you can easily explore the city from here by bus (even on Sunday evening the bus runs regularly). Showers cost 1 € extra. But shower and toilet are clean and spacious. Went there in mid-August and it was not busy. Highway and train tracks we have hardly noticed negatively. Recommended.
21148,549947,1,regibtt,12/07/2019,"Noisy place, in charge of the arrogant place and outdoor parking lot full of dirt and dust, passes a few meters the train track and every 10 minutes a train passes day and night"

21148,459166,2,brabar,19/04/2019,"Ship to park caravans and motorhomes. If you are inside, they make you park just 40 cm from your neighbor. On the outside it is an esplanade of sand. Bus to the door, but for the return it leaves you on the other side of the avenue, a bit inhospitable. Very friendly staff and cheap parking."

Plenty of parking both undercover and outside . It’s cheap too I spent 5 days here with electric , shower , toilet and water dump for just 50 Euro . I recommend the place it’s only 1-50eu to town on the bus"
21148,407043,1,MELCHORSF,12/11/2018,"It is an old ship, it is spent outside just next to the train track and the planes passing very low due to the proximity to the airport. Very noisy to rest well. The attention of the normal staff, the showers reforming but crappy, the emptying of grays and black super crappy but it is what there is. The price for 5 days € 35 (it's an offer)."

In summer and in summer this shelter is rather welcome by the strong heat, because protects from the sun. The toilets are busy being refurbished. Those existing are rather spartan. The place is monitored 24 hours a day and the doors are closed at 11 pm A bus stop, the 28th, is at the entrance of the car park and drops you off at the center next to the Prado. A little atypical stop that leaves memories."
21148,292916,4,breizhayab,18/07/2018,"Very good place for visiting Seville. The bus at the door is all right. The problem is the railway just above and the planes very close late at night and early morning, quiet at night"

It does not look good but it's quiet."
21148,281549,4,csmilne,06/07/2018,"Located 5km from Seville in a shed which seems to be predominantly for storage of motorhomes. We are not used to paying for parking in our minivan but it had a toilet and shower and the car was secure with someone always on site. Bus stop and Carrefour right next to it.  As others said, nothing flash but chatting to the day guy he said theyre updating the facilities for touristy folk like us."

If we had known that beforehand, we probably wouldn't have approached the place. Current prices are on the website. 20 euros per place for 2 people, each additional person (including babies and children) costs 5 euros. Electricity 3 euros. The street is noisy, wouldn't have bothered us for 15 euros. The pool was great!"

Next to a fairly busy road but the noise was not too intrusive. We ate in the restaurant would definitely recommend. Only 1 toilet and one shower for each sex.  Small swimming pool.
The site has two cats which are a constant nuisance when food is around. Would return."

Didn’t feel particularly welcome. Facilities basic but clean Only one toilet/shower each for male and female.  There is a bar and recreation room which I didn’t use. Other guests dogs barking was annoying.

Rates are 15€ including electric. Given its location so close to roads, it is actually a great place to stay. You can expect road noise from 7.30am onwards but nights are quiet and I’ve enjoyed my best sleep in weeks here. Site security is good, owners are very friendly and the Paella is amazing and great value. Cycle rides from here go in all directions. Most pitches get sun all day. We came for a night and stayed for 4."

Too bad that day, because of the windstorm, the wifi only worked inside the restaurant."

So to return the thanks, we will consume in your bars and businesses. On Rte. Pata Chica eats luxuriously and at a good price. And in the town they make a sausage from 10."

The area is located in the passage of another area used by the town's kids for the bottle, from the 2 cars and kids on foot with bottles, singing, bundling it next to the motorhomes. The guard comes, the kids run or hide. We asked the Civil Guard and they advised us to leave, that at 3 o'clock, with children inside, since it is usual every weekend, and the return to town is worse, according to them, they do not stop being drunk until 9 o'clock. the morning. We had to dismount and leave at 3:30 because it was unbearable and scared the little ones. The bottle area is 300 meters from the motorhomes, cars and hundreds of kids with music blaring. A shame that the city council allows it and they end up throwing tourists out of there for the desire to have drinks. The worst experience we have ever had, if you doubt"

21211,442181,3,ignacio.botella,20/03/2019,"It is quite secluded and a little far from the center of town. The area is a widening of a road traveled by trucks and vehicles. The castle only opens the holidays and weekends, if you want to visit during the week you have to specify a visit with the town hall in advance. For others it has water (with a tap tap) and where to empty the water."
21211,440561,4,OhBoy,16/03/2019,Great views. Castle worth visiting just for the 360° vistas. Lots of little shops and watering places in town. Thanks!

21211,403399,1,antoniomt,03/11/2018,"Just empty water .... abandoned place, away from the village, you have to take a lane to arrive and when you arrive you will find a super abandoned muddy plain, with an ecementado place to empty water and a broken filling tap. We emptied water and went to the town to sleep"
21211,240753,5,ml29,24/04/2018,"Good area, sloping space, great for the night and more, garbage in the village"
21211,214212,5,jlconde,09/12/2017,"Good place to leave gray and black water and load water, you can spend the night, but in the town they do not put any problem to the motorhomes"
21211,210665,2,tijera,11/11/2017,"Only good for filling and emptying services, a lot of slope and right next to a pigsty, smelly pig and many flies"

21211,86096,1,willvy,27/07/2016,"The place is away from the town about seven hundred meters and connected by a stony lane. It seems as if they want to move us away from inhabited areas. And to top it off, with slopes that can not be saved with chocks. If you go in summer prepare to have a bad time. At night he is in absolute darkness. Of those who have gone, the worst for now."

21224,3291081,2,tinela92,13/09/2023,"Actually a nice place, but as always the people are the problem. Boats are used for reservations (German).. the law enforcement officers came after 15 minutes, but they only bothered with the bathing suits, tables and chairs that were hung up to dry, as this limited the space for others.. we had already agreed second row parked with our <5m camper."
21224,3289929,3,Peluso01,12/09/2023,"We were only back from a trip to France once, last summer. Very full of cars, we managed to stay the night but very noisy. I think it's better to just empty and fill and find another place to sleep...."
21224,3287830,1,Salvaje_mente,12/09/2023,"It's getting worse every time. I've been coming to sleep all summer (when you can find a place) and I see that people are very disrespectful. They park badly, remove all the furniture, shout, etc. It fills up a lot, it's small, earthy, dirty, neglected. The draining of black water does not work. There is no control when cars invade the AC space. You call the town hall and they don't take responsibility."
21224,3280283,2,LaFurgui,10/09/2023,"The area has 6 seats but with the camper you can access the adjacent parking lot (max height 2'20m) which is very spacious. We have been there a couple of times. Very noisy at night (bottles, parties, cars...) and very lit. The floor is dusty and dirty from the bottles. Peralada is beautiful and very touristy but it is clear that they are not interested in motorhome/camper tourism."
21224,3272069,3,platoche31,08/09/2023,Medieval village to visit... The CC car park given for 6 places but we find ourselves at 12.... well... otherwise for one night (6 to 7.09) it's ok. possibility of emptying but WC receptacle full... too bad.

There were many motorhomes parked in such a way that they took up too much space to remove the chairs, tables and all the arsenal. Around 10 motorhomes and 3 campers."

Although it is crowded, the atmosphere is very good. The town is very pretty and the people are very friendly. The only but, is the water, that the payment method does not work, it only accepts payment without contact and apparently it does not work. Even so, many thanks to Peralada for the parking."

21224,2621454,2,Antalias,23/03/2023,It cannot be filled with water from the tank because the dataphone does not work to pay one euro for 5 minutes of water. I went to the tourist office and they gave me the impression that they prefer that it continue to not work so as not to supply water. All the sources of the town are cut off due to the drought in which we live.
21224,2617308,3,RandiSvendsen,20/03/2023,"it is clearly stated on the signs that there is a maximum of 6 campers. I saw more than double up. Maybe not too good if we want the place to remain there in this charming cava-town

The square is wonderfully located at the gates of the old town, which is definitely worth seeing. We found the castle museum with its special history and the restaurants great. We also did a bike tour, which was also very nice-great region"
21224,2609795,1,BelaPetra,14/03/2023,One of the most unpleasant places I've ever experienced: 1. Too crowded! Next door is a large free area - closed to WoMos. 2. No water to clean the cassette - it stinks! 3. The hole for the cassette is at about 1.30 height! You can hardly get it up! 4. Drinking water didn't work at all! Unfortunately drove a number of km in vain.
21224,2607421,1,kutenai,12/03/2023,Couldn't get a leg on the ground. The place was packed.. And more campers came.. We're further.. Even the service areas were lined up
21224,2606800,3,DaisyAndOlaf,12/03/2023,It's fine but the truth is that it was very very crowded and it doesn't have much charm. We were lucky that an ac went out just when we arrived. We do not use the services.
21224,2595712,3,Albmi,02/03/2023,"a practical area for services and visiting a very pretty village with a beautiful heritage. We met a very friendly and competent person at the Tourist Office who loves his region, it's a pleasure. Alas, no markings on the ground for campsites because they get too quickly saturated. People park anyhow and it's more in line with safety rules."
21224,2593144,4,PouniMouni,27/02/2023,"Very practical for one night, before crossing the border or visiting Figueres. Cam place. No toilets, electricity or water. But gray water service."
21224,2590538,5,winonacleptomana,25/02/2023,"we spent 1 night and everything was very good, there were several caravans, there is 1 specific place to sleep, there is a space to recharge water for €1 5 min and to throw gray and black water"
21224,2587288,4,Desertbeast,22/02/2023,"Spent one night here, everything was fine. Nice little place to take a little walk. The parking space is intended for six mobile homes, in the evening there were twelve;-) - but everyone had space."
21224,2583732,4,jcastellp,19/02/2023,"Ideal place to visit Peralada. In fact, there are two car parks for ACs and campers: the one marked as such with a sign that says there are 6 spaces but that on the two nights we spent there there were around 10-11 motorhomes and the one next door that there is room for about 10 more. Maybe because it was the carnival weekend the two car parks were very full. Area of emptying/filling with water ok."
21224,2583177,5,embKronos,19/02/2023,"Very nice place with medieval flair, good bike network and many small restaurants, everything worked well, early arrival ensures a good place."

21224,2578880,3,adam20692,15/02/2023,"A beautiful town that was great to walk around, very close to a little shop for basic supplies. There was a smell, however, maybe from the bins next to the motorhome place."
21224,2577039,4,davidbiker,13/02/2023,"Quiet and spacious area. CLEAN WATER service, we arrived and it was turned off. We came back 40 minutes later and the credit card reader screen was working. We were finally able to empty and FILL without problem. The next morning we wanted to fill up again but at 8:00 am the tap was frozen…"
21224,2576621,4,Desmosbk,13/02/2023,"Very nice little area with gray water and black water drainage. As said before no water to rinse the cassette or refuel, the card reader does not work."
21224,2573961,4,Chrisneland,10/02/2023,Unfortunately the card reader does not work. Therefore there is no fresh water...
21224,2571662,5,2winrplus,08/02/2023,an excellent place to spend the night in peace. gray and black water drained free and water filling €1. Beautiful medieval village to visit. Not much open in February.
21224,2571504,5,sazzie,07/02/2023,Great spot with loo dump and grey water. Looks like water machine not functioning but there is potable water from fountain by entrance arches to historic town. Definitely worth visit. Quiet spot for night. Highly recommend this pretty town.

21224,2565886,5,Damian1991,01/02/2023,"Free gray and black discharge service Water load 1 euro 5 minutes of use payment only with CARD. Quiet place very close to the town where there are 2 grocery stores 1 ATM various restaurants and attractions to visit We do not unload on the parking lot as some do with huge vehicles only because they cannot enter the unloading area, therefore they should unload the gray water by hand!"
21224,2564709,4,Anjo,31/01/2023,we have already come. free with services except electricity. thank you community. very beautiful medieval village just next door with shops. we will go back.

21224,2551444,2,StelianaS,14/01/2023,"We have only stopped to eat, the site is very large and there is space for many motorhomes/vans but it had a bad smell from having the containers and sewers so close. There is clean water and emptying of greys."
21224,2551105,3,MikeFrance,14/01/2023,It's free and it has the merit of being offered by the municipality but it's very rudimentary parking in the ground right next to the garbage cans but we sleep quietly there
21224,2546561,4,tomdejong,08/01/2023,"Nice place, nice village. Place filled up early January. In the evening there were 26 campers."
21224,2546337,5,DieSchmidtis,08/01/2023,"Went to Peralada at the end of December for a stopover on our southbound trip. The city is worth seeing, but unfortunately the friendliness of the community is being taken advantage of. Some campers even went to the garbage disposal department, so that the garbage collector couldn't do their job in the morning. Thank you to the residents and community."
21224,2543057,1,Truusknotjes,05/01/2023,cute village. parking place for camper vehicles is 6. during the evening a lot of camper vehicles arrived. wich is noisy and the vehicles just got so close together that is basically dangerously. some had to pull in the mirror to squeeze in. wich is a serious hazard. at 21.00 20 vehicles are parked. we could not even open our own door!
21224,2541005,4,UrTo,04/01/2023,camper area a bit crowded but still worthy of a stop for the night. loading for 1 euro and free unloading. the village is absolutely worth a visit!
21224,2534451,4,merzens,30/12/2022,Good for an overnight stay to see the village and visit Figueres the next day. Quite noisy at night and early in the morning because the place was full and many campers tried to travel at night. garbage collection and car traffic in the morning. City is cute and worth a short visit.
21224,2533175,3,catharinski,29/12/2022,"Best to arrive early. We came around 6pm and the place was full, even in winter. Not very nice but ok for one night."
21224,2527265,3,GertAbby,24/12/2022,"Quite ok for a night's sleep but not so quiet. You are here between the glass containers, a public car park and a thoroughfare with a bus stop... There are quieter places in the area."

This is great in all aspects and very quiet, which is important, apart from how I say the town is great, a lot to see, one of those places that surprises you when you wake up"
21224,2524439,3,Belen_69,19/12/2022,"it's ok, but it's too small, overflowed even in low season"
21224,2524174,4,zentrumsounds,18/12/2022,Good facility which is part of the municipal car park. Space is limited to about 8 but you can squeeze a few more campers in or park in the car parking area to the side. A bit noisy in the morning. Drinking water tap was not working but black water was fine. Perfect to stay before visiting Figueres.

21224,2503415,3,celenotaygete,23/11/2022,"Good pitch with services a little further on. Also containers available. In itself a bit small and sometimes a bit of searching to be able to stand there. During the weekend, the campers place themselves on the next piece. The village is beautiful to visit and drink a coffee on the terrace. Didn't use the services but everything seemed to work. Thanks to the community!"
21224,2502907,4,MaCa1963,22/11/2022,"The pitch is not nice but the location and the village is pretty to look at. For one night for the onward journey ideal. When we were there on November 22, 2022, the place was overcrowded, the campers stood chaotically all over the place. Then we squeezed into it too."
21224,2501344,5,Saftspritze2020,20/11/2022,"Nice pitch. V/E great. Very quiet. Today November 20 very full no more space! Unfortunately, as too often, dogs shit around wildly and the owners act as if they didn't notice!"

The traders are very welcoming. If Figueres and Roses could do the same it would be so pleasant for motorhome owners who casually run the shops and advertise for free"
21224,2488249,1,mikanaud,09/11/2022,"Impossible to put 0. The area has changed, delimited but no locations, we stick you to have a place. Dusty, the water is now chargeable. It is glued to the parking lot of the city's construction machinery. At 8 a.m., the engines are on even if they are not moving. Continuous noise. It's not what it used to be, I wouldn't spend anything here and never come back, we are not respected."
21224,2487840,1,Satori32,08/11/2022,"Absolute horror right now. The site is under construction, it is super noisy. We are piled up in a very small parking lot with the construction machinery right next to it, which is making tar. Lambs bleated all night. This morning, men came out of the building with aprons full of blood. So we slept near a slaughterhouse. Only negative emotions on this spot."
21224,2487833,5,SusanaStier,08/11/2022,Very busy place. There were definitely a lot more WoMo's on the site than described above. I loved it. Got to meet great people. Cute little old town. Thanks very much!

The village and the castle are worth seeing. a walk through Peralada and a visit to the castle are worthwhile. but the new place is terrible. Campers tell me it's always crowded and noisy here."

Road beside is very busy all night as well. We ""slept"" one night here, not recommended to anyone."
21224,2229842,3,sandrido,13/08/2022,In the end it is a good solution to park and spend the night although there is some noise especially from the cars coming out of the adjacent parking lot. It is a dirt road so it is quite dusty. There is a water fountain next to the playground. The country is really beautiful and deserves a visit especially in the evening.
21224,2201044,3,xlobatox,09/08/2022,"VERY noisy area next to the road. With a bit of shade if you are lucky and paid services (water, both for chemical toilets and for consumption, €1 5 minutes). Wide and with room for many vehicles. Parking area with height limitation right next to it. Good to visit the town and spend a night. I would recommend plugs"
21224,2200051,5,Vikmek,08/08/2022,We thought it was a great place! We got there fleeing from the Costa Brava and its excessive prices and collapsed areas and campsites. We discovered by chance a beautiful town. They were having a festival in the castle and we were accompanied by a good classical music recital during dinner. The night was super quiet and the emptying and filling of water very neat and modern! Highly recommended without a doubt!
21224,2195347,2,Nereao,08/08/2022,"It is a fairly large parking lot. The parking area for motorhomes is inside that parking lot. We stayed for a Saturday night. A lot of noise, a lot of car traffic entering and leaving the parking lot. Of course it is not a quiet place but as a positive point it is that it is attached to the entrance of the town and there is a fountain in the swings that are next to the parking lot."
21224,2195300,3,egojaure,08/08/2022,Near the village. Lots of noise at night. There is a source.
21224,2192920,4,Rull83,07/08/2022,"Free parking, perfect location to see the town (I recommend seeing it late/night, with the castle lit up). I recommend parking upstairs to go to the pool on hot days. The police often pass by."
21224,2189513,5,Lajamada,07/08/2022,"Perfect parking located right next to the pretty town of Peralada. Too bad there are people with tourism vehicles, who park and do not respect the motorhome area."
21224,2186237,1,NicolasBrabant,06/08/2022,"the black and gray water emptying is free, but the water is 1 € for 5 mins and there is an error code because only contactless is available... not great at all"
21224,2185550,1,titashore,06/08/2022,"The emptying and filling DOES NOT WORK, it is paid by card and it gives an error. We have tried several cards. does not accept cash."
21224,2163064,3,patgwen44,02/08/2022,"do not rely, especially on the photos, because you will be disappointed, although it is well placed, it is very dusty."
21224,2149560,4,gorkika,31/07/2022,"Parking with video surveillance, quiet and with an emptying and filling area at €1/5min. Recommendable."
21224,2120824,3,gioia51,25/07/2022,"We were there at the beginning of the month, a bit dusty indeed, because people have no respect, it would be enough to go slower ......... 1 euro the water I would say that as a stop 7 km from the La Jonquera border , both more than excellent. the village is worth a visit."
21224,2119382,1,palomita,25/07/2022,"I do not advise this area, there are too many people screaming at night, plus many cars use it to park where it is marked as an area. plagued by mosquitoes"
21224,2119284,1,ciberski,25/07/2022,Do not be fooled by the tranquility of the day. At night there is a continuous transit of people and vehicles due to the nightlife of the town. If you stay I recommend that you look for a space away from the road and parking for cars.
21224,2110218,4,tyrion,23/07/2022,"The pk is quite well at the entrance of the village and with an area reserved for Ac. The problem, I want to think that only while the festival is being celebrated, is that the cars invade our space when the space reserved for them with height limitation, is full. Don't wait for the municipal authorities to fine you. So, if you want to go there these days, arrive in the early afternoon"
21224,2109970,4,crigbee1,23/07/2022,"The notice here says spaces for 6 auto caravannas, however there were probably about 12 parked here last night. The car park is very busy and quite dusty. However as it’s free and water for 1 euro that is fine. Peralda itself is beautiful and the music festival very impressive for such a small place. Well worth a visit."
21224,2104184,1,dakini,21/07/2022,"a good intention of the town hall, but few places because they are occupied by cars, very noisy because of these same cars, and clouds of dust to swallow. no respect for motorists who even come to piss at the foot of motorhomes (2 Belgian cars in this case). frankly in these conditions I do not recommend."
21224,2103220,2,Koala52,21/07/2022,"The village will also be beautiful and the festival as well but: the area reserved for campers is overrun by cars, the parking is on dirt and very dusty, the water is also subject to a fee to rinse the box. I disagree with whoever gave 5stelle."
21224,2100810,5,conchiti,21/07/2022,what a beautiful town. I encourage you to go there and stay watching the town. They have a top category summer festival! Last night we were able to listen to a beautiful classical music concert. site worth visiting. the clean and adequate place with clean water and to throw dirty.
21224,2097801,5,puskajussi62,20/07/2022,Wonderful area - conserts just for you in the cassel - Classical music. Good Service ”post”. Beautiful City just 150 meters walk

21224,2061854,4,elenagm77,11/07/2022,"area with plots not delimited but very wide, some with shade. Close to town. Very quiet, we had a very good night"
21224,2049417,5,Steffi.und.Tobi,08/07/2022,"beautiful, large and undivided space with partial shade. The medieval town is well worth seeing. We spent a quiet overnight stay here"
21224,2047146,3,Caravanadominguera,07/07/2022,"The area costs €1 for 100 liters and only accepts payment by card. The area is not limited to parking, it is the entire esplanade of trees and reeds for AC and of any size since the area is wide. Caravans tb because it does not put anything. The little town is right there crossing, it has a lot of charm and there is a pastry bakery that takes the sense of gourmands, in a small square with super cute tables."
21224,2005940,4,annelisemartial,24/06/2022,thank you to the municipality for receiving us in the village with all commerce. very beautiful casino village pleasant to visit and very quiet. ideal to visit FIGUERAS by bike 6km
21224,1992630,2,Dume,19/06/2022,Number of places limited to 6 for a maximum of 48 hours. Medieval village within walking distance. Lots of traffic until midnight and a lot more from 5.30am in the morning. So not very quiet. Unfortunately
21224,1983328,4,Hugo515,16/06/2022,"The pitch has a parking lot atmosphere, little shade, lots of mosquitoes! But you will be rewarded with a good bakery, café bar, mini supermarket and restaurant in the town centre! Great sights and storks!!! Disposal free of charge!"
21224,1973374,4,TomODonnell,13/06/2022,"We stayed two nights here, and worked one day in the van with our table and chairs outside.

No toilet in the town free to use, but the cafe up the hill is nice and we had lunch and coffees in there while also using the bathroom.

Good connection to work, thanks to the town for providing the space!"
21224,1964024,4,oliviavan8892,10/06/2022,"Beautiful medieval village. Had a quiet night's sleep, just full of mosquito's."
21224,1961466,2,22SJ,09/06/2022,"It was full of cars, people arguing, if I'm from the town, if this is an area only for cars, in the end we changed places to avoid being in that place where the atmosphere was charged... the town is fine, it's medieval. Castle one pass...."
21224,1959283,4,KaneloAntonio,08/06/2022,Good area with gravel floor with unloading services the load €1 per 100 liters is paid by card near the town very nice thanks to the City Council for the free area
21224,1958795,4,naivemelody,08/06/2022,"The lot was nice, great for campers. However, the service station was out of order. We payed a few Euros with our credit card, and the machine took our money, but would not turn on. We couldn't fill the clean water or empty the toilet tank, only able to empty our grey water into the drain.

edit: Workers arrived within a few hours to fix/clean the station."
21224,1944148,5,aina84,04/06/2022,"perfect place to stop to sleep if you are in the area or on your way to France. Few municipalities in Catalonia have free spaces like these, so thank you Perelada! Next to the town that is nice to visit and spend an afternoon."
21224,1931093,4,MeryBF,30/05/2022,"Good place to spend the night if you are on your way to France. It has containers to recycle (cardboard, plastic, glass and remains). There was a bit of noise from music nearby, but if you fall asleep easily, this is no problem. It is attached to the town, so you can walk through its beautiful streets and enjoy the surroundings. We had breakfast in a square and bought bread from an oven."
21224,1912503,4,mhmbest,24/05/2022,"Nice free spot. Clean, grey water and cassette emptying place, a bit noisy but great for one night."
21224,1896390,4,bouloucecile,17/05/2022,"pretty little village, very quiet, despite the parking lot being next to the road. parking for 15 motorhomes max. 1st the 5min of water. ideal for 1 night."
21224,1893156,2,Himalaya13,16/05/2022,"A nice village and nice that Peralada offers this parking space. However, it is not atmospheric and for a quiet night this is also not the place to be because of the traffic that passes by."
21224,1890978,2,mmmpilote,15/05/2022,"The parking is a flat land, without more charm. The town is very pretty. Saturday night it was our turn that some cars -several and different- came to skid and drink. We couldn't start sleeping until 2 or 3 am. the town has no police, only a security guard and at night, no one. Near the road and cars rushing by."
21224,1888879,4,Christian-71,14/05/2022,"the parking area is without charm.. The most important thing now is the commissioning of payment to fill clean water, toilets and gray water 1 euro for 5m of water distribution c good and inexpensive given what we find elsewhere. the cassette emptying funnel too high and impractical. Payment at the terminal does not give a ticket and does not require you to enter your pin code"
21224,1864102,2,EmielEefje,01/05/2022,"You can park the camper on the side of a large parking lot without any charm. Filling/emptying is not possible, it is closed. All in all a sad intention. We drove on again. The road there was also very narrow!"
21224,1863798,2,Rabbit666,01/05/2022,"Free parking space on the outskirts, sand, flat. V/E currently works. not. Garbage can, playground, seating not far. Car parking opposite, so brisk traffic. Subtly lit and quiet at night. The historic center of Peralada has charm and there are some cycling and hiking routes in the surrounding area. Otherwise, the parking space is carelessly created and completely chaotic at the end of April!"
21224,1862511,4,lorenafuentes,30/04/2022,let's see how the night went by very quiet moment
21224,1861732,4,aroska2810,30/04/2022,"The area is very good and it is appreciated that the municipalities take care of us as in Peralada. But IMPORTANT NOTICE: as of April 30, it is not possible to use the filling or emptying of water due to the drought. Its use is sealed."
21224,1857929,4,STACY242,28/04/2022,"Nice place, big place. 6km by bike on a quiet road to the Dali Museum"
21224,1856633,4,Arist,27/04/2022,"Easily accessible on the outskirts of the beautiful municipality of Peralada. Visit painter Guy Thomas, 27c/Hospital. You will be surprised! One star deduction because the supply and disposal is out of order. The place is very crowded in the evenings at the end of April."
21224,1854761,3,tiben971,26/04/2022,Very good parking for any size vehicle. Attention emptying and filling HS on this date. Pretty little village with restaurant and casino. Trash available. No shade on those parking lot.
21224,1850391,4,fummetsvan,24/04/2022,"Out of season, it is a very quiet place, but without services. The town is fantastic and beautiful. To do some local consumption, we ate a very good rice in the restaurant ""Can Larry""."

21224,1841029,5,ManueJulien,20/04/2022,"Large car park provided by the town hall. Thank you Clean, calm but without charm. Visit the friendly medieval village if you have some time."
21224,1840971,3,rulgate,20/04/2022,"Lots of AC and vans but very quiet and safe to sleep. The water supply and emptying point was out of service (due to drought forecast according to the sign). There is a small hermitage next to it with a fountain, playground and a couple of tables."
21224,1840056,4,loorrbt,20/04/2022,"There was a lot of AC, we were in a van so we slept in the parking lot next door. The police passed by and didn't tell us anything. The town is very nice to visit."
21224,1839291,3,roxso,19/04/2022,"well located, close to the center. As a negative point, the water from the black water emptying services worked for us and neither could the gray water be emptied or fill the water tank."
21224,1838252,3,Klunkertusse,19/04/2022,Good place just below the very nice old town. Storks nest nearby. Unfortunately the supply was closed. Pity!
21224,1835232,2,AuroraCruz,18/04/2022,"The water is still closed and cannot be emptied either. A very frequent problem in this area these days. We would not return to this motorhome area, which should actually be called simply ac parking."
21224,1830703,2,joanjo,17/04/2022,"Parking with an area reserved for motorhomes (the water exchange area is out of service, so it cannot be considered an area). Local police ensure that motorhomes do not exceed the 48-hour limit, but do not penalize cars that invade reserved seats. Our expenditure in the municipality has been more than 100 euros in 24 hours, in return we could not even empty water."
21224,1821896,2,AGZ,14/04/2022,"The area is small but not bad. However, the intake and drainage services are disabled according to the city council due to the ""pertinacious drought"". By the way, to one side of the church, next to the area, there is a tap with a good flow"
21224,1821012,4,ivoderooij,14/04/2022,Nice free place. It can get quite busy but with a little fitting and measuring it always fits. service point not working.
21224,1818379,4,oscarsreisemobil,13/04/2022,"Muchas Gracias for a pleasant night. Disposal, water and garbage on site. The great castle in the picture cannot be viewed. But a wonderful old town"
21224,1815364,4,KatieCampbell,11/04/2022,"Great stop over for one night. Not much going on in the town, castle is a casino and Michelin star restaurant and we weren't allowed in the grounds to take a look. There are lots of storks nesting which is amazing to see and a great walking/cycling trails through the fields with amazing views of the mountains. Water/drainage reopened this morning. A quiet night despite being so busy with campers."
21224,1814676,5,Kaesekuchen,11/04/2022,"A great pitch for me. Illuminated at night and even video surveillance. The internet is sufficient to work. emptying available. A little tip, there are always free places towards the evening. And don't be put off by the ""6 places"" sign, it's all full of campers here. Just leave a lane to park out."
21224,1813877,4,df@orange.fr,10/04/2022,pretty village parking just below and at the entrance of the village the drains and water closed this day???
21224,1812230,3,zazin,09/04/2022,"Once again, motorhomes from northern Europe do not respect these 48-hour limits, my steps have been left there. Thank you to the municipality for letting us park."
21224,1810099,5,Fabianmeylan,08/04/2022,Super cool for one night. The police come by to greet you and ask how you are. You have to visit the old town and also observe the swans present during this period. Awesome. Lots of motorhomes on top of each other. No service but there is water near the playground behind the church.
21224,1808050,4,Polla91,06/04/2022,"4 out of 5 just because the services were closed. Very spacious and safe place. it would only be for 6 campers, but we were at least 20. It is important to park within the demarcated area for campers as the police pass by often. Also nice is the town just a stone's throw away. Recommended."
21224,1805707,2,Iogi66,04/04/2022,"Stabilized space, delimited on car and truck parking, HS services except empty cassettes, water nearby (tap behind the chapel). The only asset is the superb medieval village 2 steps away."
21224,1805561,4,3pleL,03/04/2022,Good place to stay for max 48h. Get here early or otherwise all places will be taken already
21224,1800323,4,juditpe,29/03/2022,Very beautiful medieval village with all services. Despite being on the side of the road it is a quiet place. Emptying and filling services were closed on these dates.
21224,1799380,4,ALIFEINHOLIDAY,28/03/2022,Beautiful country slept near the storks oven butcher and fruit and vegetables in the center highly recommended !!!!
21224,1798384,2,markdspot,28/03/2022,"It is a carpark,  no filling or emptying just a carpark.  There's a tap but nothing worked, or has for a while.  Nice carpark and a beautiful town though."
21224,1797589,3,Attraktiverm44,27/03/2022,"For overnight stay ok. Note the 6 parking spaces behind the signs. Before that, you realize a ticket. Disposal blocked. There is water behind the parking space. Nothing more."
21224,1794614,1,gaelchloeleo,25/03/2022,I put a star simply to draw your attention to the fact that the service area is currently closed due to risk of drought. It is always possible to park for the night or the day. However we did not sleep there.
21224,1791381,4,pierrelinda,22/03/2022,A small but beautiful village for a little walk. Cozy shops. The service station is out of service. Drinking water is available at the chapel behind the camper place. We think because there is a children's playground. A 4 because the service is not in service.
21224,1787333,5,isabellevincent,19/03/2022,"superb medieval village.... tobacconist, small grocery store.... pleasant parking, quiet"
21224,1783173,5,saverio64,14/03/2022,very busy car park even out of season. the small medieval town is worth the detour. depending on the season you will have the chance to see storks. the services are not operational. thank you to this community.
21224,1782266,5,SmartyBK,13/03/2022,"All ok, the small town is worth a visit, it's very nice!"
21224,1777099,5,bb.stefkovic,08/03/2022,"Very nice place, even now there were a lot of motorhomes, but we found free place. The night was quiet, the town is worth a visit."
21224,1774050,3,Ralphdomi,05/03/2022,"Free area but currently without services. Park on the site dedicated to camping cars. That night, the car park was saturated with around twenty motorhomes, although the dedicated space is for 6 CCs. Water behind, at the small chapel. The nearby road is quite noisy. Hikes (at the tourist office). Clean area. The police come by often. There is video surveillance. Thank you"
21224,1772839,1,gglabm,04/03/2022,Closed service area. Just parking
21224,1759712,4,aussteiger1993,19/02/2022,fine. Very beautiful historic old town. Space currently without V / E Water is at the fountain. For one night ok. Thanks to the community
21224,1755272,4,dirkprd,13/02/2022,"Beautiful and quiet motorhome at the entrance of the pleasant town. Clearly more than 6 places, but regularly check whether you are on the ""places reserved for motorhomes"" and no longer than 48 hours. Too bad that the water supply, both for supply and drainage, was closed."
21224,1754204,3,Hugues1956,12/02/2022,Good location to spend the night. it is located at the foot of the village. it is necessary to respect the location delimited to the CC because the municipal police often pass and verbalize. there is a water point next to the small chapel and garbage cans.
21224,1751086,3,Alanouille,09/02/2022,"It's a really good spot, but under development.. As previous reviews say, the services are currently closed, and will be chargeable in the future. Do not trust the photos because the parking lot on the motorhome side no longer looks like that, the motorhome area is delimited by signs, the police turn around a lot, and do not hesitate to impose fines if you are not in this zone. It is now impossible to park on the car side because there are height restrictions, however now the camper van area can accommodate more than 6 vehicles provided that everyone parks well. I advise you to arrive early! A lot of people come here in February!"
21224,1749796,3,edouard1227,07/02/2022,"The area is currently being modified, no service for the moment and the water point will have to pay in the future but by pulling the string it had to happen. The locations have been removed but a special place has been left because where do the cars come to park?? thanks to the municipality and also a shame that craftsmen park here all day"
21224,1748136,4,dirkpark4night,05/02/2022,Currently checking whether you are within the zone provided for campers
21224,1746328,4,Luisylobo,02/02/2022,"there is not much space, we in February during the week without problem. there is a pizzeria near La Mamma that is spectacular and at a good price, we recommend it"
21224,1740122,3,WolfgangSchmidt,23/01/2022,Very nice place with narrow streets. The parking lot next door is probably for local residents. The young people of the area like to meet behind the mobile home parking space. We were there from Saturday to Sunday and it was quiet from 11pm. The supply and disposal is currently out of order. Unclear why.
21224,1736976,3,Billybones82,19/01/2022,"A great little carpark that is ruined by selfish campers. a spot for 6 campers taken up by 4. so sad. 
The town is wonderful to visit and very friendly and old world. super small restaurant."

21224,1693941,4,rancer,20/11/2021,"The place is right in front of the historic city center. The service does not work at this time, but again there are reserved places for longer caravans. Not far from the center there is a bakery for breakfast."

21224,1688431,4,AnnabelleD,14/11/2021,"Super parking right next to the historic center. Spacious location, calm night with the police making surveillance passages. Only downside, the services were closed."
21224,1687552,3,FreeView,13/11/2021,The water service is closed (12 / Nov / 21) due to the risk of drought. All parking spaces occupied.
21224,1685024,4,herve6663,11/11/2021,Attention area out of service following flooding .... Usually superb area.
21224,1682557,4,TAMZEL,08/11/2021,Great place to stay overnight if you are just crossing the border. Unfortunately very noisy next to a busy roundabout. Town is cute.
21224,1682336,5,Duundich,08/11/2021,"Nice place..Vund E closed Although there are 6 parking spaces still available, a few idiots simply put themselves in car parking spaces .... stupid that at some point more and more such offers will disappear ...."
21224,1677969,2,SebaOro,04/11/2021,"Nothing special, I think the only service is drinking water. It smelled pretty bad around."
21224,1676643,4,plantefebre,03/11/2021,Thank you to the municipality for this stop shame that the services are not operational beautiful village
21224,1676166,3,raz1988,03/11/2021,The place is calm. just a pity that the emptying and filling is closed. we will only stay there one night.
21224,1674983,1,vlm,02/11/2021,Today closed by the municipal police. Drought alert pattern. Impossible to take water and empty gray and black water
21224,1674415,2,estherkuntzelaers,02/11/2021,"Unfortunately the service place is now closed with police tape? there were 15 campers last night, maybe too many? Police drove around last night but said nothing. had a quiet night."
21224,1671668,4,LC06,31/10/2021,Good for a step. Free services are always a pleasure. Quite calm night in this season with about fifteen vehicles on a large dirt parking lot. The village is very pretty to visit!
21224,1668235,3,ourvanhelsing,29/10/2021,"Rating stops is so subjective. If you want free services after a long drive to cross the border and then stop for an overnighter near an old, historically interesting small town then this will rate highly. If you do not want to stay on a dusty carpark on a roundabout with the noise of late arrivals and early departures then maybe this is not the place for you."
21224,1666063,5,gaelleetfabien,28/10/2021,All services are free and very clean. Very beautiful chateau opposite the service area.
21224,1657934,5,Forus1959,23/10/2021,"Very nice place near a historic town. Empty dirty water and toilet, fill water and all this for free. There are 6 places reserved for large motorhomes. Congratulations to the city for providing this facility for free"
21224,1654945,4,yarru,21/10/2021,Only 6 places occupied when we arrived. Many other motorhomes in the parking lot where we were able to settle in for a stopover night. Noisy early in the morning but quiet at night. Thank you to the municipality for this welcome and for tolerating our presence outside the 6 reserved places.
21224,1648420,4,Gilfert,17/10/2021,"Very good place as a starting point for sightseeing and a round of golf. Before the pandemic, there were two of us on the parking space, today there were 27 mobile homes neatly distributed in the very large parking lot."
21224,1645609,5,yvonnezimmer,15/10/2021,Highly recommended

Close to the nice downtown of Peralada. Selective trash at the back of the parking. Children playground next to the small church just outside."

21224,1610511,4,CalViudo,26/09/2021,Very well located area and a bit noisy during the day. It is often full but there is no problem if the parking spaces to the right of the entrance are filled
21224,1608068,5,kandil,25/09/2021,"A bit noisy first thing in the morning but bearable. Although the six spaces were full, there were another 10 in the parking lot. Good hotels in the village. Recommendable."
21224,1602166,5,JoeTravels,23/09/2021,"Designated camper spot on an mix parking, nice ancient village with a few bars and small grocery store with local veggies. Quiet, does the trick perfectly well!"
21224,1593839,5,Cazaou,20/09/2021,"Very charming place at the gates of the old town to visit without fail! There are only 6 places reserved for the Cc but the place is large and spacious. There is water and drain (gray and black). The nights are calm. The village is worth a look, the library in the museum: 80,000 works collected! Guided tours by very kind and attentive guides. 2 pleasant nights. Recommended!"
21224,1584839,5,suki.m,17/09/2021,"We have been a couple of nights ago, all good, the AC pitches were already occupied but there was plenty of room, I pass the premises and did not say anything, there were many of us, quiet, perhaps with too much light. Charming town"
21224,1574017,4,jps89,13/09/2021,"A good place to spend the night, recharge water, not electricity, and take a walk around the town in the morning, it is worth it."
21224,1541727,5,Afbs,02/09/2021,Good area with all services and reserved plots. 30 meters from the town.
21224,1539205,5,fredericoalli,02/09/2021,"A good place to park with 6 places for motorhomes with a good space between them. Very close to the old town and also to the castle of the city that today is a casino. In 1 hour, 1 hour and a half visit everything. There is also the castle museum but it opens at different times and we are not going to take advantage of it."
21224,1498683,4,aldipa,22/08/2021,"Very flat, with all services free. a place without noise a town to visit with its streets and castle."
21224,1497246,3,yaizita8,22/08/2021,"Asphalt parking near the center of town. In the morning something noisy since it is the parking that there is to visit the town and a road passes next to it. It has surveillance cameras and passed the police patrolling on several occasions. It has reserved 5 or 6 places for motorhomes. There is a nearby fountain, at the entrance to the town."
21224,1489147,5,alirayo,20/08/2021,I can't talk about the night because we don't sleep but it's very close to town and it's comfortable
21224,1485734,5,lemonevil,20/08/2021,"In the same town entrance. There is plenty of parking if the reserved spaces are caught, and the town itself is a charm"
21224,1468859,4,joserudi,17/08/2021,The water and discharge services are very good but it is true that there is noise at night and early because of its proximity to the roundabout.
21224,1464366,2,Trav3ll3r,16/08/2021,A parking lot with a lot of noise throughout the night. Only six spaces reserved for motorhomes but you can spend the night in the parking lot next door. There is a colony of cats nearby which brings a bad smell. I would not go back.
21224,1455181,4,turtle19,14/08/2021,"Thank you to the municipality for providing us with camper places, it allowed us to discover your pretty village. just a small downside. too bad we are installed at the roundabout with the cars."
21224,1442777,5,lamartineta,12/08/2021,"We spent the night of August 9th. it is a very good place to spend a night, with all services, less light, but it is free. You can't ask for more. It is worth visiting my village."
21224,1437134,5,VoyageurReveur,10/08/2021,"We stopped to use the services. Clean and complete, eg, in and clean water. A few places reserved for motorhomes at the entrance to the car park."
21224,1433041,4,vivirnoescaro,10/08/2021,"Great for sleeping and especially for the free filling and emptying services. There are few places for motorhomes. Although the parking is large, we arrived at night in high season and it was very difficult to park. Place to sleep and visit the area, but not to spend the day in peace because there is a lot of car traffic."
21224,1427624,4,gamarra,09/08/2021,"Well, with services to spend the night. Pretty village"
21224,1416053,5,sebasti,07/08/2021,"Fantastic area. Next to the castle and the town. Very few spaces, but with large adjacent parking to be able to stay if there is no room. Services to empty and fill. A 10."
21224,1404077,5,huuronzecamper,04/08/2021,"Absolute 10 out of 10, not for parking per se, but for the free services close to town."
21224,1349716,4,Claualfutur,22/07/2021,"We almost cried with emotion when we arrived at this ""area"" ... which is without more a car park enabled with 6 spaces to be able to park and spend the night ... since it indicates that you can be parked 48h max Nothing to do with the area of the French Riviera where we come from that limit most if not all the parking points by height! a real shame and mistreatment to the tourist !!"
21224,1344077,5,Biggles66,20/07/2021,"Fantastic. Clean, great system for disposal of grey and black. Easy access. Thanks to Paralada ayuntamiento. Fabulous classic festival in summer - Opera, ballet, etc"
21224,1334662,3,Lobo.loboblanco,17/07/2021,"Good site to visit the town, only 5 seats and the sewage clogged can not be unloaded."
21224,1332427,1,Britt_V,17/07/2021,"We dont know what is wrong exactly, probably its clogged, but we couldnt empty our chemical toilet here"
21224,1332195,4,sutegi,17/07/2021,Motorhome area with services is very good !!
21224,1330689,4,Alvarohego,16/07/2021,"Area with video surveillance, which, seeing as it is, is not the least ... the road is close, but cars do not bother at night. good to spend the night on the way."
21224,1327098,4,Jasmijn1997,15/07/2021,"Well serviced place with taps. Stayed one night, light shines into the van and you hear cars passing early in the morning. However, wonderful place near the old town."
21224,1304899,3,Tierras_Insolitas,08/07/2021,"The squares are well leveled and there is a loading and unloading area. As a downside, and that is why we do not give it 5 stars, it is next to the road and cars are heard a lot when passing (especially if you sleep with the roof raised). The parking lot being so large, they could have made the area further away from traffic). Otherwise, good initiative."
21224,1298723,5,JosePili06,05/07/2021,Thanks to the city council for this initiative. Great location perfect to walk through its streets in a very beautiful town. Nice places to eat and a beautiful castle. The place is quiet and the night without noise. If it is true that at 6 in the morning a car woke us up because the main road is right next to it. But it is not a hassle.
21224,1294379,5,dominn11,03/07/2021,06/30/2021 A quiet place in a small town. I recommend it to families with children. In the vicinity playground. You can take a walk around the area.
21224,1281264,5,vanguioca,27/06/2021,Good area. Free services. Hard to find shade.
21224,1273591,4,Lorbanister,24/06/2021,"Good place to spend a night. Level parking and plenty of parking space. Being a public parking lot there is a lot of movement, but we had no problem. You can empty and fill. Easy access and right next to the town where there is an incredible castle. The only downside is that there are many storks next door and an incredible invasion of parrots that make quite a lot of noise."
21224,1271535,4,teodomiro61,23/06/2021,"The area is good, next to the town, the only drawback is that there is car parking and from six in the morning there is already noise and on the road too, I liked that they have reserved places for motorhomes and what in other places the cars invade them."
21224,1239845,2,AlbaGRF,06/06/2021,"Despite being spacious and shady, there is a nearby park where they meet to drink bottles. We couldn't sleep because of the screaming and the music until 3:30 a.m. ... A shame, because the town is very beautiful and worth visiting."
21224,1230462,5,Catavantour,01/06/2021,Good for sleeping and visiting the city.
21224,1212040,1,Robello,23/05/2021,"To be avoided on Sundays. Runaway church bell, aimless loitering youths shouting and screaming all night long, collecting the garbage container."
21224,1204978,5,familiaventura.pl,18/05/2021,"Very nice service point with everything you need for free. separete parking spaces for campers. possibility to park for 48 h. 
very nice neighbourhood, small town and Castle with Gardens."

21224,1194326,5,thehikingvan,12/05/2021,"6 spacious parking spaces provided for mobile homes / campervans. Unloading of gray and black and filling of fresh water, clean and in order. Nice town to wander around!"
21224,1183306,5,varaxavi,02/05/2021,"Great place to spend a maximum of 48 hours. Touching the village. All services. Very quiet, although it is also touching the roundabout at the entrance of the village and at some point you notice the traffic, but it is not a problem. The passage of storks through this place is being reintroduced. You can see the nests and birds next to the car park. Recommended !!"
21224,1182697,5,Abenteuervanlife,01/05/2021,"Great place to spend a relaxing night in transit. Supply and disposal work great and are easy to reach. The old town next door is very beautiful and worth a visit. Some campers stand on the gravel piece next to the parking lot. At night the square is illuminated, but it doesn't bother too much. Just a shame about the compatriot in the rental camper, who disposed of his foamy gray water in the middle of the gravel instead of driving 30 meters further to the disposal. Such people unfortunately ruin it for everyone else."
21224,1180832,5,Hunkpapa,27/04/2021,Very well maintained area with filling and emptying services. My congratulations to the city council. Congratulations.
21224,1180339,5,jujofarito,26/04/2021,"Good place right next to the old town. We inquired about the town and took a tour of the castle (correctly the monastery, the castle is used privately). We didn't park in the officially signposted spaces, but on the large gravel space next door. Is a little further away from the roundabout, and therefore quieter."
21224,1178464,4,teaa_travels,24/04/2021,Beautiful place! Small bakery in town with delicious rolls. Disposal station is very good. Parking spaces are a little difficult to park if the motorhome is larger. No problem with a van.
21224,1173721,5,Mutbegleiter,14/04/2021,I drove by again today for the disposal. The black water drain (toilet) is free again. TOP! Thanks to the community for acting quickly!
21224,1172521,3,Mutbegleiter,12/04/2021,"A practical place in and of itself. The reserved signs and the trees between the plots are well meant, unfortunately make it difficult for large motorhomes to park in and out. The black water hole is completely blocked. The Guárdia Municipal has been aware of this since 12.4.21."
21224,1170149,4,Martinneumair,08/04/2021,Free and well maintained. It is only a gravel parking lot but right next to the town with shops and restaurants. Absolutely recommended for a short stay.
21224,1165692,5,ferraneta,03/04/2021,"Very good parking area and services. Everything clean and well maintained. Walking and cycling routes through the surrounding villages and fields. Thank you, the town hall and the people of Peralada. Perfect"

21224,1164908,5,MarcosHerencia,03/04/2021,Perfect area and also to visit the village
21224,1164493,4,condestinoalmundo,02/04/2021,"Perfect for visiting Peralada, emptying and filling everything correct. Only 6 seats but the esplanade had some more without problems."
21224,1162211,5,Omar.alvarez,31/03/2021,"Motorhome area with 6 places, although there is also a fairly large ground parking. It has emptying of black and gray water and filling with water. There is a policeman at the entrance watching a bit, a full parking lot!"
21224,1161158,5,xgoReus,30/03/2021,It is a recommended place to spend the night. It is still a car park with services but quiet and the village is beautiful. There are six places reserved for motorhomes and there is a whole dirt car park where there were more. a cafe in the village where they make delicious breakfasts and sandwiches and a bread oven with wood oven with very good products. Thanks to the town hall for the idea.
21224,1160756,5,javichimeno,29/03/2021,Highly recommended. In addition to the 6 official places there is enough space for many more AC and campers. Right now we are the triple! The village is a charm. A visit to the museum and gardens is not offered on Mondays. During the day the storks are seen and heard a few meters away.
21224,1154445,5,Francis2408,20/03/2021,"Stayed here for 2 nights, very quiet, the place is great to explore, great bakery within 2 minutes walk, free water and disposal of gray and black water. We stood with 3 or 5 other campers - some with large buses"

21224,1129174,3,Didiousse,08/01/2021,"Very calm site, with all services, on the other hand skeptical pit which overflows, and gives off a nauseating odor. Thank you in winter, otherwise in summer I think it would be impossible to stay within 100m. Otherwise once this is settled it's a very nice place."
21224,1129117,5,Bobtail77,08/01/2021,Perfect place to spend the night before the border with France. The small town is ideal for a short walk.

Next year we will stop and visit the castle and cloister. We were unable to do so due to lack of time (the tourist office closes at 5:00 p.m. and we were there at 4:30 p.m., the cloister being in the same place)."

On the other hand, it is a parking lot and the police services remind us: we cannot take out a chair to relax. The nights can be noisy (traffic), at the moment the castle park is closed for work, it's a shame it seemed magnificent."

It is actually a very large parking located right in front of the entrance of the historic village. 6 places are reserved for motorhomes (panels in front of each of these places) but one can park anywhere. These 6 places are actually closest to the roundabout, but the cars that pass by are counted on the fingers of the hand. We were ten motorhomes. The area offers all services for free and it is very clean. There are garbage cans and sorting. The night was extremely calm, as well as the morning. It was not planned in our program, but we took the opportunity to visit the village late morning: beautiful !! Without this free area, we would have missed it!"

Next to the entrance roundabout so there is noise. In summer there is a festival of Peralada, that is music and cars circling until the many. Surely better out of July / August"

Bravo: finally a municipality that has understood everything unlike Cadaques who refuses. Just a flat: the sound of bottles falling in the container at 4am and that of a truck (trash?) Turning on the parking a Saturday morning at 5am. But this can not be prevented because public parking. Very well. Thank you."

21224,410653,4,Xarifa,28/11/2018,"Nice place with everything you need. The 6 pitches are marked with ropes, otherwise you can also put in the parking lot. The traffic is something to hear, as is a nearby large construction site and at the weekend teens try their mopeds. The storks and green parrots in the nearby trees are fascinating. Thanks to the town hall for this free parking space."

21224,396310,3,Josephinemarteens,20/10/2018,"Always nice this small parking to spend one night or more. This village is really worth visiting, and a stop Plaça del Carme to drink a coffee con licked in this small typical Catalan cafe and eat one of their delicious croissants chocolate. You can also have a meal or sandwiches. Grocery store, bakery, butcher shop, in the village. Two banks with ATM ATMs ATM."
21224,395399,5,soroeta,18/10/2018,"It is grateful to be able to empty and fill the waters for free, thanks to towns like this one. I was scared by the comments of the noise, at the time of sleeping without problems. The squares I have seen them well."

21224,389044,4,irnbru,07/10/2018,We almost overlooked this place. We chose instead to go to the nearby paid site but left again and ended up here.  The motorhome parking area is at the edge of s roundabout.  I think there is a loose drain in middle of the road  so you can hear the cars go over it.  Unless you are a light sleeper it shouldn’t bother you.  We had a peaceful night except for the thunder.  Lovely little town and this aire is certainly worth a visit if your nearby.
21224,381780,4,mtjferre,25/09/2018,Very nice area with the services of emptying and free filling and the pitches are well delimited and reserved and separated from the cars

There would be no paper in the toilet, although I think that if there isn't, it's because people take it…. Which could also be. Very well connected, with a bike lane at the door that takes you through all of Palamós. Mercadona and aldi 10 minutes walk, as well as the coastal path and beach. Thank you!"
21228,2673080,4,Lgodoy,15/04/2023,"We spent 3 nights in one of the squares with views of the sea. The location is ideal for doing a stretch of the Camí de Ronda, cycling routes and/or visiting the town. We missed hot water to wash the dishes, toilet paper and that our stay coincided with the town's Carnival, what a party they put on! They woke us up at ungodly hours with machine music at full volume."

21228,2627922,4,Maike.Bruestle,28/03/2023,"Nice place, in 30 minutes you are at the port of Palamos and also in the pretty fishing village of Cala s'Alguer. Unfortunately there are only 4 toilets and showers, no toilet paper and no soap available. Hot water has to be paid extra for 1€/5min. No warm water when rinsing either. All in all good for the price."
21228,2624669,5,GerardNicoleCH,26/03/2023,"Warm welcome and quiet place. We had the place overlooking the sea. The showers and toilets are serviced twice a day. Hot showers 5 mins for one euro, enough. Machines for washing and drying clothes. Very nice walk along the coast and colorful fishing village to discover at Cala s'Alguer and finally a beautiful and large sandy beach 10 minutes walk away in Palamos."
21228,2613408,1,ThomKlim,18/03/2023,"Well located, but still recommended for a maximum of one night. Not enough power connections, no paper in the toilet, not even soap to wash your hands. No hot water for rinsing. I will avoid the place in the future."

21228,2606043,4,Helton,11/03/2023,"Great views from the terraces and reasonably close to very good restaurants in Palamos. Space can be tight due to a combination of steep access, stone walls and close parking - we saw one CC crash. 

Downsides are the toilets, though work is going to be done, and the WiFi which is weak and relies on out of date security and isn't safe."
21228,2604445,5,JanWildschut,10/03/2023,"Very nice place, despite the fact that the shower does not always cooperate. Sanitary facilities are clean and spacious. friendly reception.

All services + toilet + washing machine and dryer. If I have to say a pro: there is no hot water for washing dishes. 25 minutes from the center and 10 minutes from Cala Fosca. Ideal area for walking. Low season price without electricity: €14.32. Very friendly reception."

21228,1691183,5,CamperJuulenPetra,17/11/2021,We have been coming here for several years and still find it an excellent motorhome for a normally affordable price. Everything is there what you need. The sani spot is located at the entrance and is nicely spacious. WiFi is unfortunately only in the lower places. But the upper places have the most beautiful sea view! We will come again next time. We paid €26 all in for 2 days.

21228,1665222,4,flexi81,27/10/2021,"Nice place and great surroundings. Great little town with nice shops. Small bays for swimming and snorkeling and great hiking trails, as well as sandy beaches. Star deduction because of the extra cost for the shower. Otherwise everything was great!"
21228,1663179,4,Airbrousse,26/10/2021,"Very friendly staff, campsite near the beach and town center. Be careful with places near the wall (TV cannot be picked up). Quite noisy because of the road and roundabout below. We stayed there for 2 nights: 26 € with a full 7m50. Good value for money."
21228,1657063,5,ken44,22/10/2021,"Excellent! Reception in French. If you arrive between 12:30 p.m. and 4 p.m., the office is closed but does not prevent you from settling in. You will regularize later. Electricity at all levels. The beach is relatively close and very pleasant. A coastal path allows a beautiful walk. We will return. 13 € per night."
21228,1654231,5,Cauxcas,20/10/2021,"For the rest, I agree with the majority of other opinions. This area is well kept, close to beaches, shops and the city. The staff are VERY CAREFUL which adds to our pleasure to be there. We will return with joy"
21228,1654212,5,Cauxcas,20/10/2021,"WARNING ! The address given is not correct and I found myself in a dead end. The coordinates are good, but for the address I suggest: 37 Cami Vell de la Fosca. This should take you to the roundabout where the entrance to the area is."
21228,1647258,5,VeniVidiBibi,16/10/2021,"Great multi leveled Aire .
Big service area , bins,  toilets , showers at cost.

21228,1580873,4,ManuelV.S,15/09/2021,"A 10 for this Area in all respects, only one drawback, the happy little ants that you find everywhere the next day. I guess they will fix it"

The reception with an exquisite attention that makes you feel great. The organization if you arrive outside hours is perfect, at reception there is a list with your seat number, and in the plaza a cone with your name. IT IS AN AREA NOT OF 10, BUT OF 12. Congratulations!"

21228,1563712,3,xandru,09/09/2021,"It is not bad but there are things to improve, for example during the day there is not always someone at the reception to assist you and it gives rise to error if you have made a reservation and do not find anyone to ask, little more than you cook it and yourself you eat it. And what made me stunned, they charge you € 1 for 5 min of cold water ... if that is how the water came out of the showers, shameful."
21228,1555602,5,Piot59,07/09/2021,"Beautiful view, cordial welcome. We already came three years ago and happy to find this area again!"
21228,1555056,3,davidferola,07/09/2021,Good night. Price in September € 15. Some road noise. I don't like it when the reception speaks to me in Catalan when you're not from here.

21228,1531192,3,DaniAw,30/08/2021,Very good motorhome area managed by a good team. We spent a very quiet night. It is far and uphill from the beach and the town.
21228,1523501,5,Victoriaeutopa,28/08/2021,It was my first camper experience and my choice could not have been better. Very correct services. I have been able to see the sunrise over the Illes Formigues from my van on the third floor. I really liked a man who comes first thing in the morning to feed the sparrows that are waiting for him. I will repeat.
21228,1517221,5,alexpi,26/08/2021,"A good place, correct price € 20 per night. There is a bike path exit at the door. Walking 10 min to the town or the beach. A 10. In summary, we will repeat for sure."

21228,1473499,2,Alai,17/08/2021,Very nice place. Well organized and adequate services. The cycle path passes through the town of Pamamos (which ends in a moment) and Calella. Only the pool is missing.

21228,1449818,5,Sorifer90,13/08/2021,"We had a very good experience in that place. The attention of the staff is excellent, always attentive. The services are adequate for an area and the plots are perfectly leveled. If we return to the area we will repeat for sure."
21228,1432747,4,frederic1967,10/08/2021,Very friendly area and a very warm welcome only small downside is the situation of the area which at first very sloping only one sanitary at the top of it (shower at 1 € very good) and apart from the beach de la fosca which is 800 meters on foot quite steep nothing else despite these slight inconvenience I recommend price 20 € with services
21228,1381172,3,Totofe78,30/07/2021,"Very clean, not far from the beach, but as much camping space for a single sink for dishes and a single washing machine, it is still limited."
21228,1376124,5,SergioRosales,28/07/2021,"We spent the night of 07/20. Very popular place due to its proximity to the beach. Excellent service even by phone when arriving after hours. Clean and neat showers and toilets. Large pitches. If you are spending more than one night, a little shade would not be bad, but it is just a comment. 100% recommended for us."
21228,1375207,4,Karine26300,28/07/2021,"Very knowledgeable, speaks French and helpful. place in the shade. Just one night. 8 minutes from the beach. Good address"

21228,1308035,4,Irulegui,09/07/2021,"Great area, although there is no shade as it is very high there is a pleasant wind, the ground is made of small stones avoiding raising dust. The beautiful Cala Fosca, it is not worth going to the one in Palamós, much more urbanized. Booking in summer, it was full at the beginning of July, from platforms 3 and 4 there are views of the sea, although you pay € 2 more."
21228,1307466,5,Celinetorres,09/07/2021,"Be careful with maneuvers as the access is very sloping. Aire in plateaux, calm, paying shower. It is better to book in this season. No shade but air because in height."

It has several bathrooms, with showers and sinks, electricity, emptying and filling with water. Super recommended! Next to the beach and the coastal path that leads to Platja del Castell!"
21228,1289059,5,PaulaT,01/07/2021,"All services, comfortable and very well located."
21228,1252574,4,ConLunitavan1,13/06/2021,"The site is super good, the only downside that we put is that there is not a shadow, but the treatment is great and it is clean, beach 10 min walk and town 15."
21228,1251117,4,abeccas,12/06/2021,Well organized. comfortable. The main buts is that the beach and the town are 10-15 min walk away. and it has no shadow. the rest ok

21228,1128896,5,JRM64,07/01/2021,Excellent area. € 13 with electricity. We have been 4 great days. Nearby there is a Mercadona. La Fosca beach highly recommended. A very kind treatment from Rosa. Going to areas like this is appreciated. We will be back for sure.

21228,1125491,5,lothian,29/12/2020,"Let's spend Christmas with this area, from 24 to 28/12. So far the best overnight stay we have paid for. Mari is an excellent person who has everything very well organized. Clean, lots of silence between all the campers, huge spaces, WC services, showers, etc. Drainage, etc. All super easy. We will be back without a doubt."
21228,1124088,5,MarkAm,26/12/2020,"Excellent ac area. The plots are terraced on 4 levels, so they all have views towards the sea. Everything very clean, both the bathrooms and the pitches. The pitches are spacious and wide. Very good ac area, at a super cheap price of € 13 with everything included, we signed it up to repeat again without hesitation !!!"
21228,1123638,4,lebefitter,24/12/2020,"Visit on December 18, 2020. Price € 13 per night including utilities, electricity and wifi - although the wifi was only satisfactory for the lower levels. Hardly any signal arrives at the top. Shower costs 1 € for 5 minutes in addition and is ok for Spanish standards. The places are flat surfaces. It is very steep to the supply and disposal station and to the upper levels, which is why older or weak motorhomes could have a problem with the clutch. We didn't dare to go to the service station a second time with our VW T4 78PS weighing 2.5 tons. Payment is uncomplicated even when the office is not manned. Then you can simply put the money in the mailbox. The next supermarket is a bit far away and the hilly landscape is not an easy walk for everyone. It's a great place for sporty people. Located on bike paths and a long-distance hiking trail. It is about a 10-minute walk to the beach, which is very beautiful and very little visited. The complex is nice to look at because of the terraces. Some places have a sea view."

21228,1078921,4,fil1013,02/10/2020,"Well I just spent there, which disturbs why two euros more to see the sea there. Money still easily earned and not justified even in high season. this is not an apartment hell !! toilets and the rest a little weak with lack of privacy there are simpler not far"

21228,51517,4,pistatxeta,23/08/2015,"Very new AC area so it does not yet have shadows. At the moment it only has 2 toilets with showers so sometimes there is a queue... There are at least 2 more under construction that seem to be coming soon. The attention is very correct and also the cleanliness. It has gray/black emptying services, filling, washing machine, sink for washing, plots with light... In general everything is very good, the last star for when the sinks and light in all the plots run out. Highly recommended."
21228,49661,4,paskhy,16/08/2015,"Pay area €10-15 located in a steep area. It is designed in the form of large terraces which are accessed from a paved street on the right. The land is fine gravel and there are no lines separating the plots, so the AutoCs are sometimes piled up, leaving a minimum space between them. You can take out awnings, tables and make life in the street. Showering costs €1 - 5' of water. The dishwasher area is very tight with a single sink and next to it a washing machine, which also uses coins. In general it is good, and just a 10' walk from the ""Cala de la Fosca"" beach. The wifi does not reach correctly all points in the area, so it will be necessary to use the mobile rate. Today the average occupancy has been 85-100%, so I recommend securing a place before coming to spend the night."

It does not have any type of service, bathrooms, water drains, etc. Of course, today it seemed like a good place to sleep, we have half settled and we had to go out at full speed because of the mosquitoes that ate us in bites. There were so many. Perhaps it is also the season that they are active, but there were many."

I was there for 4 days, I saw two French motorhomes arrive with two trailers which went to the bottom so as not to interfere and who left at the same time as me. Duration 4 days. However, they left the site clean. End of the controversy."

The market starts setting up at 4am so you need to be out of the designated parking places or you will be stuck there for the day. You can park directly across the carpark and will be able to get out.
The services and area is great."

Small but cosy. We had a quiet night.

The parking lot is right next to the police station, but that doesn't seem to deter anyone!! There was also a guy sneaking around the vans during the day. We actually felt very safe, but you never know and then something like that happens... so be careful!"
21335,2637494,5,vaneomoreno,03/04/2023,We have slept here tonight. One of the best areas we've been to. In the official motorhome area there are 3 places but it is in a car park where you can also spend the night. Attached to the town and with bathrooms that are cleaned daily.
21335,2600251,4,Montanan,06/03/2023,Great place to spend a night or two. Clean toilets which are well lit and safe at night. It’s a big area with trees.

We parked in a truck spot because we had no choice.
Afterwards, many many trucks arrived and we got trapped between them.

21340,1296676,4,JaviEva,04/07/2021,"Quiet night on a weekday June. Yes it is true that there is a football field in the area itself, but it does not bother, at 9 o'clock they all left and we were alone. The weekend is still different. Services very good, except the light, which does not indicate (or at least we did not see) how it works. It is not ""pretty"", but I do not see it inhospitable, nor so far from the center (one step away from the Cathedral)."
21340,1277468,2,txampe,26/06/2021,"I give it two stars because the loading and unloading facility is good and free, but it should be noted that as other colleagues say, it is a meeting area for youth late at night so rest is impossible. We have been sleeping on a Friday in June"
21340,1256554,1,miaguchispa8,15/06/2021,"The area, although wide, is very far from everything, it has no shade and the place is inhospitable. In midsummer the heat will be horrible."
21340,1203025,3,txinor,16/05/2021,"A large and flat parking lot. the part of the motorhomes is in a corner, away from the main road. Today we went to unload gray, the drain was clogged but you can see that people have unloaded the same. Lack of maintenance. Attached to the campsite there are very crowded football fields, with people approaching there in cars, quite fast ... It has good it paints but lacks some control."
21340,1111962,4,Xikitines,04/11/2020,New area still without chips for the light. They told us that in a couple of months the light could be used with tokens. Large area with lots of sun and very close to town. Very good initiative to the town of Calahorra
21340,1097720,4,Enfelen,18/10/2020,"Good area to spend the night, good flatness, water, gray and wc even paid electricity so very good. Thank the city council for the site provided ... 1 minute from the Jewish quarter (in itself it is not very beautiful but it has its Jewish history ...)"
21340,1092986,4,AndreaTon,14/10/2020,"Perfect location on walking distance to the city. It has water services
Also, power should be available but it is unclear where to get the eurorelais tokens to activate the power outlets. We had a perfect quiet night without a single disturbance as others commented about disturbing youngsters. The police drove by around 11pm and we felt perfectly safe."
21340,1071753,3,Marianlaudio,27/09/2020,"Area next to Rapaz land (highly recommended site especially if you like animals) and the center of Calahorra. We spent the night very quiet, not a sound"
21340,1070173,3,christiancastro,26/09/2020,"We slept one night with no problem, the truth was that at night there were some young people with a car and music, but not so loud and we were not afraid. The municipalities have come and the issue has ended."
21340,1065167,4,Acap,23/09/2020,"Good place to sleep. Emptying / filling water services, but they could expand the electricity, because there are only two intakes."
21340,1029924,4,Cio,06/09/2020,"Today we are 3 autocvs. I do not appreciate the feeling of insecurity, although it is true that there are 2 cars in the car park and they are installing some of the sound equipment. The water services work, the electricity service goes with tokens (1 token 6 hours) but it does not set a price or where to buy it."
21340,1027936,3,ALADINOLOBO,05/09/2020,"It is located on a large paved esplanade where there is also parking for cars. It has a very good appearance and a good view of the town. It is next to a bridge with a lot of traffic (daytime and nighttime noise). When we arrived there was a single user who seemed to have been installed there for a long time (the feeling of insecurity mentioned in other comments is true). There were also young people with their cars, with their typical and annoying activities. In short, a shame, but it does not meet the basic requirements for motorhomes (safety and no noise). We did not check the water services because they were monopolized by the super-installed user who did not seem very friendly. It is a pity because surely the city council has put this area with good will."
21340,1007884,2,edukido,27/08/2020,"An excellent area, with all the services, but we have quickly left due to the insecurity that the place gave off. They had parked several cars with youth, others repairing dilapidated vehicles and other adults with minibikes running around the parking lot. As soon as you leave the area on foot, you go straight into a neighborhood that is not advisable to travel, we left despite it being already 8 p.m."
21340,986569,5,suavirgi,21/08/2020,We spent the night from Thursday to Friday and very well. Very quiet place and without any problem.
21340,982893,1,opiu,19/08/2020,"Ideal area if you like to party, bottle until the wee hours of the morning and music at full volume. Not recommended if the intention is to rest."
21340,982773,1,Candeli,19/08/2020,"You can't do things that badly. Area that does not transmit any security. It is far from everything and unless when you arrive you meet a brave person, it is normal to leave. We stayed and late at night cars began to arrive rushing into the parking lot. Speakers at full volume, etc. we left."
21340,954697,4,king3tris,12/08/2020,"The area IS ALREADY OPERATING, with free gray and black water discharge service and free clean water filling, and electricity by paying with token (4 plugs), although it has not been clear to me where to get the tokens. 8 spacious, well leveled places. Sparse shade. One step away from the cathedral, crossing the Ebro."
21340,953741,4,camperpiccola,12/08/2020,"Okay, smooth ground, water and drainage of gray and black water. When we have been, it has been very quiet. Remember to leave everything clean!"
21340,942056,5,Lauyser,09/08/2020,"Well preserved area. Very quiet for the night, the police come by often. Thank you very much Calahorra Town Hall. To put a but, you would need a container for the garbage"
21340,923212,3,tyrion,02/08/2020,"Spacious spaces at the entrance of the village in a large parking lot. You can charge water and empty gray and black water. Although there is a plug to plug in, the electrical system is not yet enabled"
21340,921650,1,cnietopr,02/08/2020,"Area with all the services working, there is still a need to connect the electricity, next to the cathedral, but in the Pk next to the area, there are always meetings, celebrations and bottles. A pity, otherwise very good, but when we were until 2-3 in the morning"
21340,916201,1,sandralm8,31/07/2020,"An area that is located in a very degraded neighborhood of Calahorra, we will never return."
21340,899086,1,rkrjacint,26/07/2020,"If it is day to go out or try it, it is a place for the bottle and one of the greats."
21340,891356,4,flaitravel,23/07/2020,"You have everything you need to make a stop: it is flat, there are many squares, there is a green area, to empty and fill ... We had a quiet night, although in the morning you could feel the road a bit."
21340,886142,5,LuisFernandoJimenez,21/07/2020,An area 10. three that made with three different mouths emptying black and gray very well organized.
21340,865481,3,BlaBa,13/07/2020,"New area. Free water and emptying. The electricity that goes with chips is still not working. The pole is next to two parking lots, the others are in front and if you don't have a VERY long cable you don't get there. Come on a baby carriage, access is not adequate to reach the town. The townspeople use the services to fill bottles, shower and wash the car, I hope it does not affect us."
21340,856071,4,JR.,08/07/2020,"Good area with water, emptying of gray and black waters and light tower with operation with jeton, on hot days the hot water comes out more than 100 l. and in these dates at dusk there are many mosquitoes, the area is perfectly located, on the river bank with beautiful walks on both sides and near the cathedral"
21340,853456,4,alsag29,07/07/2020,"Quiet area by the river and very close to the cathedral and the center. Emptying and filling of waters and possibility of catching light. We spent one night, the only downside was that there was no streetlight on in the entire parking lot."
21340,846850,2,JordiPoma,03/07/2020,"Good place to spend the night, although when we went there were some guys with a super loud loudspeaker making a big bottle around 12 at night. We had to notify the municipal police, they came right away and made them go outside. We spent the rest of the night very well"
21340,793378,4,corbygeordie,09/03/2020,Brand new facilities as @ 6.3.2020.
21340,128527,3,Angelcamper,17/04/2017,Good place to spend a night. Historical set very close
21340,127586,3,jojedam,14/04/2017,We slept calmly and without problems. Just on the other side of the river there is a fantastic Picnic area.
21340,127262,1,sandraverdeguer,13/04/2017,"We did not like it, we left, the youth was doing in a bottle, continuously passing cars. and we had to go, just in case."
21340,56699,2,gon943,03/10/2015,"Not bad, near downtown Calahorra is asphalted and clean, we arrived at 10:30 pm and we were about to stay overnight because it was very dark, we were encouraged to stay because there was a van of a couple and we went to the side . Asleep well although somewhat insecure."
21340,51766,3,javier larrosa,23/08/2015,"We found it very lonely, good for one night."
21342,3211542,4,Maverikc,24/08/2023,"All the services are there, although they are a little tight, the water does not come out with much pressure and it is not very well signposted, but it is right where the application indicates. Thank you Utiel for the detail of having this point for Motorhomes. please, let's leave the sites clean !!!"
21342,3172160,3,elviajemehizoami,18/08/2023,"All the services are there, although unfortunately it is quite uncomfortable to empty blacks and with very little pressure. Some type of signage indicating the services and where to park exactly would also be appreciated. Still appreciated."
21342,3105602,3,KnightBusTravel,09/08/2023,"It's okay, a bit busy at night. But enough for one night"
21342,3040340,5,decano1980,29/07/2023,Quite flat site with services and quiet. Perhaps somewhat uncomfortable to empty the pot and to fill water. In September (during the holidays) it is not available. Linked by a walk with the town where it is worth taking a walk through its historic center and visiting the Café Salón Perez (a true gem). Nearby is the Alameda park with some cafes with a lot of atmosphere in summer.
21342,2971864,3,ptcarlospt,16/07/2023,Difficult to find the service point.
21342,2845806,3,LexRainolds,12/06/2023,Fair area... Two stars are because at least you can do the services. The third is for being free. He took two stars off because it seems that you are away from everything...regular environment...and above all because to access the services you risk your wheels...the floor is full of screws and wires...when I went I removed some 10 from the ground... The night was quiet.
21342,2747726,4,DanielaMally,14/05/2023,A very good place to stay in close proximity to the highway. I haven't seen any V/E.
21342,2715288,5,galileo1983,01/05/2023,"Quiet area, next to the fairgrounds. At 200 m a park for the little ones. We spent the night and everything was perfect, there were about 15 motorhomes."
21342,2711886,4,MarilinaRibas,01/05/2023,"It was not very clear to us if the area to park the motorhomes is inside the park or in the open space behind where the water change is. We parked in the open field, we were alone and very comfortable. Utiel recommendable town. Just comment that the hole to empty the pot is the diameter of a pipe, which makes its use quite complicated. We went to Requena to empty and load"
21342,2711468,4,Unji2013,30/04/2023,Thank you to the city for this very quiet area. We spent a quiet night there. Nice place with plenty of room and you can see the police passing regularly which is reassuring.
21342,2705416,4,Josemanuelmt73,29/04/2023,"The motorhome area is behind a place where I understand they put on the fair. We arrived at night and the next day we realized this point. Even so, there were several motorhomes and we have spent a very quiet night. Emptying area with access by dirt road."
21342,2683128,4,karinchristian,20/04/2023,"we, like 10 others, parked on the avenue under the trees. Bit noisy during the day but super quiet at night."
21342,2669587,5,PacoSampedro,14/04/2023,Plenty of space and level. Quiet place and well located to visit the town. Thank you so much .
21342,2655789,5,josejuank,09/04/2023,Perfect and spacious area. flat. Ten vehicles passing the night. Nearby toilets and working fountain. Very good for the city council of Utiel
21342,2650950,5,IBueno,08/04/2023,"Phenomenal area, quiet and flat to park."
21342,2650504,5,patxitxa,08/04/2023,"A wonderful site. Thanks to the municipality. Easy to maneuver, wide and connected by a walk to Utiel. It is worth visiting, having a drink at the Pérez lounge café and taking a walk around the old part. a luxury"
21342,2640652,4,MikiMarco,05/04/2023,"It is very wide for many motorhomes, campers, etc. It has to empty gray and black ones, although they could have already put the tap for the black ones higher up because you have to juggle to fill the potti and clean it and the mouth of the tap for the clean ones is narrow like that you have to come prepared with an adapter otherwise very well the area is very quiet to empty it is behind where you sleep"
21342,2617584,5,VTT13,20/03/2023,"Easy access, free water, worry-free toilet and gray water emptying. Thanks to the city! Ample parking possible for the night."
21342,2615989,4,MariayHeydar,19/03/2023,Very spacious and comfortable area. We stopped to eat and very well
21342,2614261,5,pepitoReyes,18/03/2023,"A spacious and flat place. You have some services downstairs, you can change your water perfectly! Close to a Consum, nearby bars! A very good place to spend the night! From September 1 to 10 are the patron saint festivities of the town and you cannot park because the fair and festivities are installed!!! Highly recommended and very safe place !!!"
21342,2606928,3,Saradelro,12/03/2023,"Quiet place, without services and free, near a gas station with a highly recommended restaurant"
21342,2579776,4,leptitjp,16/02/2023,"The area is not indicated, but the gps points are good. It's not terrible at first glance, but practical for emptying the black and gray, without flow problems. Unfortunately, there are a few shards of glass and plastic waste around the site. We settled in and other CCs came to spend the night. The night was calm. This is where the locals come to walk their dogs, but the place is big enough! The esplanade is monitored by camera. We did some shopping at the nearby Consum, and had lunch at the Castillo restaurant, it was very good!"
21342,2577401,4,Catbo,14/02/2023,not very glamorous and air that is creepy at first sight but do not trust it. we were alone. no problem during the night in addition there is emptying of the toilets and more water filling. the city is a few steps away very good alte for a quiet night
21342,2528162,1,Fer-Lau,25/12/2022,"An isolated piece of land that does not give any security, we entered and left immediately."
21342,2486835,2,Yi_ita,07/11/2022,"Hole to park in line for 6 cars approx, an esplanade of sand and two taps WITHOUT WATER so emptying the sewage is quite complicated unless you fill and clean with the water from your own car. It is not signposted, you must pass a kind of park towards a dead end street."
21342,2486246,3,Douddawn,07/11/2022,No water available at this time. We can just empty the gray water. We cannot fill. Shame. Visit the Bodega Utiel Anas cooperative winery in the city. The lady is very friendly and the wine is good with native grape varieties (Boréal).
21342,2463332,4,Ranchoneta,26/10/2022,"Huge esplanade of land where you can park without any problem, either in the shade of the trees or in the sun to fully charge the battery, it is forbidden to park in the park, well signposted, later we complain that they do not let us park anywhere, there is always some Gil... who gets in the wrong place when the assigned place is completely empty. Perf site to make enormous meetings."
21342,2458437,5,Magdazk,23/10/2022,Very large esplanade of land. Next to the booth is the loading and unloading. Very spacious and clean. We didn't sleep there.
21342,2457417,5,MALI34,23/10/2022,"Well equipped area for services and quiet nights close to the center and shops. This weekend, like every year at this time, there were festivities around a gastronomy and viticulture fair which brought a little entertainment."
21342,2436883,1,mariohs,11/10/2022,"The access is bad because of the rains, the park is very dirty and guys going around the car, it made me insecure and I left."
21342,2403331,5,andresm61,25/09/2022,"We slept in the park through which you enter the area. At night, and with motorhomes parked, we stayed under the trees and it was great, but the area is just past the park, and it's where the Utiel fairs are held, so it can't be used if there are parties. To sleep is fine and you have a water change service and the town is close."
21342,2291909,2,coletademelilla,23/08/2022,"esplana without shade and terral impossible to stay in the morning with sun, at night and to sleep it is fine it has water and it is free but we only use it to sleep and in the early morning to run out before the sun sets, what a pity that in this province do not think. more in us"
21342,2283459,4,Alhu7,22/08/2022,Great area we spend the night very well and the town right next door
21342,2269482,3,jarosa,19/08/2022,The area was inaccessible because of a party they were setting up. We stayed the same to sleep on the night of 08/19

21342,2234916,4,emiguama,14/08/2022,"Good site. We spent a very quiet Saturday night, without drinking or noise. In the morning, people from the town strolling, but without any disturbance. In a park with a nice walk and terraces. Overall good place to spend the night. Thank you very much"
21342,2234307,3,elcisnetrotamundos,14/08/2022,"It's fine, it gives a feeling of insecurity, but spend a night without problem, no shade, you can load and unload dirty water and drinking water, it is next to a nice park"
21342,2194378,3,willifodd,08/08/2022,"Good place to stop as it is next to a pedestrian walkway where there are bars and parks for the little ones. It says that you can stay 48 hours but I don't think they say anything, we were two motorhomes. If I realized that the other motorhome was placed further from the pedestrian walkway, we should have done the same. The bad thing, where I parked kids with motorcycles and then I didn't see but today I spun with a car which sounded like a rally car. About 3 in the morning they left. The truth is that we were on July 28, it was Thursday. Well, I give it three stars because it caught me on the way and it is one of the few places in the area that are quite good. Thanks to the town hall for creating this space but they should have removed it a bit from the hustle and bustle. The best , park far away as there is space . That if I don't imagine it on the weekend… Hehe."
21342,2145063,5,aurelien.joye,30/07/2022,"very good area, we had a great night, quiet and shady, thank you to the municipality :-)."

21342,2023261,3,Rubiocks74,30/06/2022,"Second time we stayed to sleep, and everything perfect. Some noise from kids playing until approximately 00:00. Local police 100 meters away and playground next door."
21342,2020015,3,RosaAlejo,28/06/2022,"The area is in a nice walk, and the best thing that few areas have, is shade. But worst of all is the dirt and dog poop everywhere. It's a shame to have this area so neglected. Let's have a very quiet night."
21342,2011623,1,joseab,26/06/2022,"The service area is set up acceptably, but... A lot of noise throughout the night and at 3 in the morning we had to leave, invaded by hundreds of young people making ""bottles"", which seems frequent due to the dirt of bottles and plastics that we had seen in the enclosure and surroundings."
21342,1987699,3,kanau,18/06/2022,It is a very quiet area. There is a lot of shade. It is surrounded by arizonicas making a more private area. In the back there is an agiliti for dogs that is very good. We also find the area where to fill the water tank and empty gray water. We spent the night very quiet.
21342,1980011,4,sachatromp,15/06/2022,"stayed on the gravel parking lot, because you could see and hear a lot of cars and people. 
during the night the sound was okay. people stopped comibg during the evening. sometimes locals walk by with a dog. 
the parking itself if very level. I stood near the trees and had shade all of the morning."

21342,1949550,4,posvasereso,05/06/2022,"Very good area and with a lot of parking next to a park with many people walking but without noise. To put a snag, the filling/emptying area is not marked, when we arrived it was already dark and it was difficult for us to find it. Otherwise perfect. Thank you Utiel"
21342,1913867,5,Andreacamper,25/05/2022,"Perfect place surrounded by a beautiful environment. Safe and quiet place with park, ice cream parlor and nearby supermarket."
21342,1909471,4,Lemarelta,23/05/2022,calm and safe. There is everything but not very comfortable. The most beautiful thing is the tranquility of the parking area. We have spent two very nice days just sitting on the benches of the Paseo de la Alameda (which is not Alameda but Plátaneros) and letting yourself be carried away by the peace of the environment. The town is nothing special but there is everything. We have missed recycling bins.
21342,1909075,5,oscargr_69,23/05/2022,"quiet night, safe place, near the barracks. the police make the rounds. the neighbors confirm that there were never any incidents. only picnic tables would be missing. ideal for a stopover en route."

21342,1862604,5,silbervogel,30/04/2022,"very nice large place, good for dog owners. I was completely alone here. Water and disposal free of charge. Thanks for providing us travelers."
21342,1860986,3,Kaoruya,30/04/2022,"The problem with this area is that it is not well signposted, it is not known if it is the area with the trees or the vacant lot next to it and to avoid problems we parked in the vacant lot, the same thought of 5 other motorhomes with whom we slept. The water thing is correct, it has both to load and to empty. The three is due to poor signage but if it weren't for that it would be a 5."
21342,1830371,5,LILIANILLA,17/04/2022,"Excellent area, large, level and with emptying and filling service (it is behind the parking area, it is a vacant lot). We spent the night very quiet"
21342,1828436,4,EcsLevante,16/04/2022,"the area is great, the last two photos have nothing to do with it, good shadows, lots of parking spaces, linked to the town with a huge promenade, firm pavement, the truth is very good I was there all afternoon but I didn't sleep."

21342,1824181,2,lenisharma,15/04/2022,"Levelled parking. Keep in mind that there is no decent public toilet. There is one, but it was vandalized and it is very dirty, and everything is broken. If you have a toilet in your rig, it is good for one night. If not, you can visit one of the close-by cafes. The locals take their dogs for a walk there, mainly with out leash. Dog poop everywhere. Charming town center in walking distance."

21342,1794234,3,padraigl,24/03/2022,"This Aire needs signage for parking and the services.

During heavy rain we parked with others on the concrete at the end of the park but the official parking is under the trees. 

The services are free but the black waste is a mystery. Found evidence of black waste under a square manhole beside the building that the 2*taps drain and grey waste drain also emptied into."
21342,1785479,1,Mnazz,17/03/2022,"The place is good in itself, only this shooting does not open up to me, allegedly a parrot problem, only far into the night was shot here that disturbed my sleep a lot and during the night quad drivers also discovered the place for themselves, otherwise the place is very large only poorly signposted"
21342,1779127,5,chimotass,10/03/2022,"A 10 for the town hall and neighbors who have made an area for our group. The water intake and emptying is in perfect condition. It is located next to a large park, but finding it is a bit tedious. A couple of signs and it would be perfect!!!! The night calm and unforeseen. 100% recommendable."
21342,1777130,5,isabellaoh,08/03/2022,"Stayed one night along with 2 other motorhomes, quiet at night and only some dog walkers during the day. Very big area, so can’t imagine that it ever gets crowded, especially not during winter. All services were in working order. There’s also an agility area, which our dog Pernille really enjoyed. There are public toilets in the area just to the right, they’re pretty shady and dirty but they exist"

We parked in the area of the promenade (there are always people walking) and tonight we were about five motorhomes. Everything is relatively close, bakeries, supermarket, shops, bars. Very quiet and cozy town."
21342,1745565,3,MC4333,01/02/2022,Thank you Utiel. The area is very close to the A3 and you can walk to the city center. The sewage emptying area is attacked and freezes. (Raising it a bit I think it would solve it).
21342,1736671,1,Estrenc,18/01/2022,"We arrived at night and we were not very happy, everything was dark, alone and we left. We went to Requena, we were also alone but it did not give us the feeling of insecurity. If it does not improve, it is not highly recommended."
21342,1725916,4,isidrosanchez,04/01/2022,"Very quiet area on the outskirts of the town. The motorhome area is a sandy esplanade but we spent the night 4 motorhomes / Campers in the wooded area at the end of the mall and apparently, it is authorized, since the local police passed by twice, without telling us anything. As in other comments, the sewage drainage still does not work, totally muffled. A shame ....."

It's fine for a stop to eat or rest, although the loading taps are on the same pylon where the shit is floating. Quiet area, although there are a lot of dog walkers and prowlers. 04-16-2022. I pass by here again, and I stay to sleep, along with 24 AC and other campers. Very well."

21342,1705053,3,garmingr,07/12/2021,"Area with basic filling and emptying services. To discover the emptying and filling dock you have to take a walk, it is located behind the booth that is in the open field of Tierra, separated from the motorhome parking. The town is picturesque with its historic route."

The area is behind the park we arrived at night and we did not see it, he advised to get out of the motorhome and look for a walking area so as not to go around the park. There were two more motorhomes. thank these areas"
21342,1692893,4,nancylm,19/11/2021,"It is close to the historic center and is a supermarket. Also very close to the highway so you take a detour. Very simple, but with many streetlights which gives a feeling of security. If you have pets perfect because it is next to a dog park"

Full shade. Great spot. its huge and used by a handful of dog walkers. we were not moved on. don't understand why they want to park you on the roadside when under the trees is much much nicer. t"

21342,1545170,1,bolinche.vane,04/09/2021,We didn't like it at all. Small area difficult to locate next to a large busy park full of young people making bottles. Neglected. We arrived at night and we couldn't even see the fountain. We decided to spend the night elsewhere.
21342,1487360,3,BuenasPeluso,20/08/2021,"Dirt site, level, with shadows, bins, near the town and supermarkets. The gray and black drainage area is behind a brick shed, between the shed and the trees. The clean water tap was working today. Very few people."
21342,1397011,1,rberned,03/08/2021,"Horrifying. Lots of noise from kids with motorcycles and cars constantly coming and going, and shouting and singing in the park just behind. We had to leave as it was impossible to sleep. Avoid this area to sleep, at least in summer."
21342,1336387,4,Heliodora,18/07/2021,"They have already put two taps to fill water and drain gray water, a place with shadows and very close to cafes is the extension of the Alameda, very quiet. Today 07-18-21 we have come to eat and we are alone."
21342,1202847,3,MOG88,16/05/2021,"We have stopped just passing a while, the area is just dirt but next to it, 100 meters away there is a park (without swings) with benches and plenty of shade and a fountain, ideal for children to run or ride a bike. The park has public restrooms."

21342,1092592,1,Maxi-Ana,13/10/2020,Yesterday without taps to fill and clean. It looks like abandoned. A shame.
21342,1055128,1,tigresa,17/09/2020,"Actually I would put a 0, without services practically abandoned, the poster could not be read, we spent the night because it was already late."
21342,1045724,1,mjgmil,13/09/2020,There's no water. there are only the drains.
21342,1030299,1,Aitor-Blanco,06/09/2020,There is nothing here anymore .... We stop to eat because next door there is a shady area but nothing else.
21342,965474,1,dagg,15/08/2020,It continues without services. Disassembled water taps. Sewage disabled. Only gray water can be discharged.
21342,936596,2,esdiemor,07/08/2020,"A pity that such a large and well-shaded area does not have the service of carrying water available. We have only been able to download grays. Anyway, a shame."
21342,846534,1,Favelas,03/07/2020,Area without taps to load. Only gray download.
21342,841479,3,Focusout,29/06/2020,When we arrived on 27/6 the water tap was working. When we left 2 days later the water tap had been removed and the water was capped off. There is good shade under the plane trees but can be noisy at night. Walk into Utiel is easy with plenty of shops.
21342,787774,4,Zulupi,28/02/2020,We have stayed here twice and all very quiet.
21342,778329,3,Fuerteterror,09/02/2020,I would only use it to sleep as a last resort. To discharge gray and black water well if it happens to you. It is on the outskirts of town but walking distance you reach the center immediately.
21342,770243,3,Alvor,19/01/2020,"I spent one night in January - contrary to some comments I read it was a very calm night, maybe the rain helped to keep the “noisy” young people away. There is no tap to fill water and the system for emptying the cassette is impractical! The area is also not easy to find, it is after passing the garden area. The service area is just to the left - next to a white warehouse. Anyway, thanks to the municipality for making this area available as they are not easy to find on this route through southern Spain."
21342,764473,4,CBcamposanto,05/01/2020,"Good location close to the highway but sufficiently remote. It has a CS with water connection without thread. Beware of dog cows that are not removed because it is full. In the evening, surely you crush one."
21342,764374,1,AlbayLucas,04/01/2020,"Very dirty area, they use the same tap to wash the cassette of the drum than to take clean water, instead of a bottle and used as a public drum."

21342,759743,5,majualda,30/12/2019,"We have been one night and super well, it is true that it is a shame that people who walk their dogs do not pick up the poops, but the area and Utiel are worth it, we will return. Thanks to the town hall"
21342,755931,1,ElChispi71,22/12/2019,"To thank the City Council for its support for motorhome tourism, but if a part of its inhabitants (some young people) are dedicated to disturbing, we will leave without visiting the heritage of their town and therefore, without making use of their shops and restaurants; Throwing down the City Council's effort to attract tourism and with it wealth for the town It would be nice to control this."
21342,753076,5,Fitotina,12/12/2019,"Good place to spend the night. the town is very pretty, it deserves some little canes to enjoy it"
21342,751318,3,Telemaco,08/12/2019,"It is with many bowel movements. The City Council has signs asking the owners to pick them up but it is impossible to walk off the asphalt without stepping on them; it's a shame. I recommend not walking at night for the same. The area is quiet and great to spend a few days in Utiel, except what was said"
21342,743771,2,tonypaella,16/11/2019,"Quiet place, only the discharge station is made stupid. Loosplaats is stupid, you have to go backwards to drive away, otherwise you will hit the ground with a bumper"
21342,738448,4,VALLESCOM,04/11/2019,We were the bridge of November 1. Good place to spend the night. A bit ruinous because there were funny young people passing by with the car and the music at full speed. Luckily it was a while alone.
21342,736757,1,dafyd,02/11/2019,Three vans on this Aires we all left when the cars started arriving and tearing up and down the road. Found parking in a quiet side road. Not recommended.
21342,733676,3,SalvaCastilla,30/10/2019,"We were there to load and unload water. The water intake and drain are a bit hidden, at the end of the area next to a small warehouse where they seem to hold playful activities. The car park seems close to the town although at the time we arrived it looked lonely"
21342,719213,5,Angelsjavi,12/10/2019,"We stopped to sleep on the road. Totally recommended, upon arrival there were 5 more Ac. Meeting area for young people who could be heard in the distance. We sleep peacefully. I think we were just before the area in the tree area and a walk"
21342,713298,1,Gienki_Hit_The_Road,05/10/2019,"Avoid during weekends, a lot of noisy teenagers playing loud music at night... not a calm place at all, if you need to stay choose a place furthest to the west in a gravel field"

21342,646921,5,jaime...,20/08/2019,"For me, it seems to me a pretty good area with its necessary services of loading and unloading of waters, staying overnight, that more can be asked of a small municipality ..."
21342,644989,4,cesardiegocastanedo,20/08/2019,"The ac area itself is a simple esplanade without shadow, poorly leveled and with poor access. Before arriving at the area there is a park through which you can access trees on both sides where we have stayed without problems and in the shade six motor homes, while the area remains empty. There are water fountains, and bars on the promenade. A little noisy area because it is a walk zone and neighborhood meeting."
21342,629441,3,JulianA70,15/08/2019,"We slept well, a little difficult to find because there is a near cut area and the GPS is bundled, there is a fountain but we have not found anything else, a quiet area with a nearby park and horizontal ground."
21342,599482,1,cuevi,04/08/2019,"No signaling I know it exists because I am from the town next door. We had to ask the civil guard to find her and I know we arrived because there was a van parked. But we found no source to empty black or gray. We keep going. The area is fine, in September there is a fair and everything is full. And they have very good sausage and very good wine. But the area leaves enough to be desired."
21342,589797,1,bouffonnasse,01/08/2019,"I confirm my comment. This morning at 8 o'clock the brigade leaves. A big reinforcement of accelerator of the blower, the street and particularly the place of parking of the 2 cc to be polished, cleaned, chandeliers bottom. I remember that the leaves are on the trees until autumn. the City Hall employee really insisted around the cc. no respect."
21342,589088,1,bouffonnasse,31/07/2019,Signage almost non-existent. abandoned place in the middle of nowhere. we have come a long way for a sidewalk without a soul. this serapourune night without more.
21342,525917,1,CharlyFr,23/06/2019,"Appears abandoned, gives a feeling of insecurity"
21342,523157,2,paganx,21/06/2019,"Place on the outskirts, good to drive. Supermarket within walking distance. Used this car park for an overnight stay. It was a bit scary, because it was very far away, but completely sufficient for one night. Faucet available."
21342,479099,1,Maudandjustin,08/05/2019,"Horrible. Looks super run down, difficulty to find the amenities. We just wanted to stop in town to go grocery and eat lunch and it was a nightmare to navigate everything is small streets or barricaded. Don’t recommend especially with bigger cc!"
21342,458366,4,JuergenD,18/04/2019,Thanks to Utiel for this free place with water and disposal. On Wednesday morning market was very close.
21342,458363,5,balavag,18/04/2019,"Super area Spacious, clean and quiet. Do not hesitate to stop at Utiel"
21342,454766,4,kucavana,14/04/2019,Great area but eye with google where it gets you and that is not well signposted. Find that the coordinates are perfect. There was a lot of motor homes. Good place to spend the night on journeys and a good little village
21342,454391,4,callajo,14/04/2019,"We slept tonight and very quiet place huge ten cars, would take a hundred haha I recommend it, small and nice town"
21342,445934,1,PapetNanni,28/03/2019,Do not inspire confidence. Pity . A city like this could better highlight this area
21342,442975,2,chickpea,22/03/2019,Only parked here to go to the supermarket. Very close to the college so lots of teenagers around. Dog mess everywhere. Wouldn’t want to stop the night!
21342,428889,2,Perdi2xelmundo,13/02/2019,"Very neglected area. Service of gray and black casting difficult to find: it is in a stone fountain, next to a white ship, access by land outside the parking area. It serves to visit the locality, although it is place of botellón of the young people of the place, so, little tranquility if you stay overnight Friday or Saturday."
21342,425118,3,Jomifa,27/01/2019,"Free and with all services except light, must park in the park that has before the area to Acs because that is where it has others, quiet."
21342,420069,2,Massicann,04/01/2019,"This very secluded, we were alone. a little abandoned No noise at night, but it was Thursday. I suppose that in summer there will be a lot of bottleneck noise. next to an institute."
21342,419718,2,IvanIvan,03/01/2019,Maybe the town is nice to see but the feeling that the area gave us (especially at night) was very insecure. No cars and away from the village.
21342,418580,3,buntbaer2001,31/12/2018,"Stayed from 30. to 31.12. Quiet night, except of one honking car at the night. But the area could be a little bit less messier... Dog shit is lying everywhere.  That's because the neighborhood is used as a dog run area and it looks like Spanish people mostly don’t care about dog shit. Fresh water is only a push button, therefore you need a helping hand for filling your tank."
21342,418268,3,marcospm,31/12/2018,"It is not a bad place to spend the night if you are passing, but we were hit by a few people at 00:30 and at 3:40 at night with a car spinning and honking."

21342,388331,4,emjauk,05/10/2018,Called in here to check waste facilities. It is an odd spot. You park facing the college. The waste area is on the dirt area on the left as you drive in. All waste area working ok. Didn't stay and probably wouldn't unless desperate.
21342,318374,4,nuria474,06/08/2018,Very quiet area with very clean nearby public toilets
21342,297501,4,antojo73,22/07/2018,Fantastic free public area. Very wide. The problem is that Friday night was very noisy. Until 1 in the morning listening to young people talking. But we spent the night quiet.

21342,289109,4,ppjuanes,15/07/2018,"We only used the services as we were passing through, but there is a very large plain and a flat area in front of the Institute to spend the night or park and visit the town. We have been in July there were several very nice terraces to drink something nearby."

21342,278168,3,cegalme,01/07/2018,"Good place to spend the night, we spent a Saturday night and we thought we were going to have a bit of a fuss because it is a big park and has a nearby food bar that gets very good, but we spent a very quiet night. When we arrived there were about 4 or 5 Ac. recommendable"
21342,266411,1,pado,10/06/2018,"No camper but cars services are mostly used to shovel 4/4 or tractors a dumpster in front of the taps, I see young people sitting on the masonry or are fixed the faucets and who throw their cans on the ground . Often there are areas for motorhomes or parked cars certainly illiterate drivers"
21342,263615,5,PattyTrufaRas,04/06/2018,"Stop between the IES Alameda institute and a park. Parking spaces in front of the IES and next to a kind of shed, the area of ​​water change in the form of a stone fountain."

21342,231101,2,Xarifa,30/03/2018,"So many different comments! I think the place is unsuitable for weekends and holidays because of the noisy youth, but quiet during the week. I was there on Good Friday and left immediately, as I saw young people preparing for a party night."
21342,230459,5,rotti,28/03/2018,"Very quiet place, close to the town and large park at the back. Well lit. Totally recommended. Thanks to Utiel"
21342,219259,4,ElVasco,17/01/2018,"Quiet and flat site, with filling and emptying services. Walking area next to the town."
21342,218475,3,qb2,11/01/2018,"Easy to find but hidden in turn. I arrived on the night of 04/01/18 and there was no one, some daring doing sports if anything. Soon another AC arrived, but he saw it too far away and left. I spent the night perfectly and in the morning I made use of all their services. It should not be highly recommended at the weekend, it is right on a walk and a giant flat."
21342,215756,4,davidvid,25/12/2017,"Water ok and it is drinkable, we were passing a good and quiet night, the area is behind a nice walk that leads to the town in 5 '"
21342,213939,3,baranyes,08/12/2017,Area near the highway and the center of town. The only bad thing is that the water does not work (at least this day). But it is a good place.
21342,212479,3,pakorrer,24/11/2017,Area with services less electricity. Very good to visit Utiel we spent a few hours to see the town.
21342,211381,5,Afrikwana,16/11/2017,"Great place to spend the night and even the day, no water to fill the tank. Very nice place, people are nice, and when we walk in the city we notice that finally it is great."
21342,189462,1,tonyr,03/09/2017,Poorly maintained free overnight parking area. Lots of rubbish and broken glass when we visited. Didn't stay the night as planned. Moved on to another aire as didn't seem safe.
21342,184272,3,jonatanpardo,25/08/2017,It was difficult to find the area since it is in a dead end street. The signs are scarce. We had to ask a person from the town. The area is quite secluded and many people go to walk their dog or young people with their cars. In our case we did not have any mishap in spending the night.
21342,162472,1,james54,01/08/2017,"To run away: dirty, young people who make noise until 5 o'clock in the morning behind the cedar hedge and the icing on the cake a car drifting along our machine. We do not feel safe."
21342,123588,3,Dijanx,21/03/2017,Ok for fluid exchange and a nights stay. Quiet in the evenings. Also great for a stroll into town.
21342,119490,3,Pistrus,06/02/2017,"Separate area attached to some schools, but inside a park in spring it has to be beautiful. The emptying area is behind some trees. We liked it fulfills its purpose"
21342,116679,4,macaria88,26/12/2016,This is the tenth time we stop here and the area is still quiet. That night we were alone. Behind the hedge of ciprés one finds the free services. Near the city center and shops. We love the calm and tranquility of the proximity of the village free services.
21342,115223,1,ete7,01/12/2016,"Closed, abandoned, inaccessible"
21342,79442,1,Angarbui,03/07/2016,"A pity that an initial municipal effort is lost due to lack of care and vigilance. Poorly indicated, without instructions. Dirty, broken glass on the floor, bottles of bottles, NOISE, skids. Let's go. Yes, we leave at one in the morning, and tomorrow we will lose Utiel on the first day of vacation."
21342,53423,4,jcaloza,02/09/2015,"Quiet area at least during the week, well lit, near a pedestrian avenue with bars and park for children, highly recommended. I recommend the municipal pool bar."
21342,49240,3,albertulo,15/08/2015,"Well to spend a night if it is a working day because the weekend is a bottle area. Wash basins (look for them) emptying of waters, park. Unpleasant place and too bright and very frequented."

21365,3232225,1,Flikis,28/08/2023,We have not been able to find the services. The area has no charm.
21365,2880732,1,JORDI2EURA,22/06/2023,"It's only worth stopping for the magnificent supermarket at the entrance to the polygon, because that's what this stop is: a polygon car park. I preferred to go to Barbastre, where there is a real area."
21365,2821854,1,ruedines,05/06/2023,"I do not recommend it, they touched the windows of the motorhome. They tried to force the one in the bathroom and the alarm that I have set on the windows went off all this while we were sleeping. We had 2 motorhomes and a camper. Better to go to the other one that is at the exit towards Barbastro"
21365,2448511,2,sun1,17/10/2022,Didn’t stay after the last comments I was not going to take a chance

21365,2363116,3,Beltranejeros,11/09/2022,"Reading some comments we thought about not going. Finally we have spent the weekend and we have been calm and well. It is on the outskirts but in the same town, supermarket and Chinese bazaar next door. Emptying and filling area. I'm sorry that other colleagues have suffered the prank on duty, we had more luck, when you are in a busy area, unfortunately you run that risk."
21365,2349156,1,siljes,07/09/2022,"To avoid the 5th of September they stoned us. We called the local police who told us that they had caught two of the four skate hooligans. They assured us that we would sleep peacefully and so it was, but I doubt that the problem is stopped. So area not to use though thanks to Monsoon for the free upload and download service"
21365,2343586,1,Gacek8210,05/09/2022,Attention!!! We were pelted with stones. Big damage. Watch out for this place!

21365,2053582,5,CapitanAlatriste,09/07/2022,"In front of a hyper ""Asian"", trees, a sink for dirty and gray. Clean water in two taps. And across the road, a gas station and a supermarket, the perfect definition of a stop along the way. Thank you Monzón."
21365,1995642,3,Lauravrc21,20/06/2022,"We have only emptied and filled. It's in the left corner as you enter, a bit hidden. Next to a large Chinese and in front of the gas station and supermarket."
21365,1837802,1,TimeBandit,19/04/2022,"Attention!!!! stay away!!!! At night they throw stones at the Campers. Got quite a bit of damage. Sorry, can't post photos. Policía Local and Guardia Civil are quick but can't do anything until they get caught."
21365,1824507,2,gon943,15/04/2022,"We did not like it for an OVERNIGHT, nor did we take a nap, since the noise of the nearby gas station music and the cars on the nearby road bothers us a lot. We ate here and went to the next point."
21365,1774770,1,joysi,06/03/2022,"To avoid, at night a group of thugs began to stone the Camper. Had to get the hell out of there."
21365,1769589,2,rabegon68,28/02/2022,"The area is fine. It has all the services. The bad thing is that the music from the gas station of the supermarket across the street plays from 07:00 to 23:00. It is torture. It would be nice if, since the city council bothers to set up an area, it would take note and do something to stop the music, which should also bother the neighbors."
21365,1740762,3,xavierfarras,24/01/2022,paved and level parking. there is no shade. correct water emptying and filling area. there is room for 6 motorhomes. in front gas station and supermarket. right next to industrial estate. eye! the gps took me to the other side; where the trucks and buses park! we only stop to empty and fill water.
21365,1635864,3,Remolin,10/10/2021,"Correct area, the place is quiet on the weekend, although due to its location it is likely that during the working week there will be noise because it is next to an industrial estate. On the other hand, there is a supermarket in front of it and it is close to the center (just ten minutes walking)."
21365,1590788,1,hana43,19/09/2021,We went there and we went our way. Truck parking in interest.

21365,1528027,1,dominguez.aj,29/08/2021,"AC area to avoid at all costs. Only if you don't have any other options. In a Pol. Industrial next to the highway. And more when 10kms. there is another really fantastic one, in Binaced."
21365,1519815,1,atomarpormundox,27/08/2021,"AC in an industrial estate, with 6 or 7 parking spaces. It's okay to drain the waters and sleep if you have no other choice.

21365,1339740,1,AsierDominguez,19/07/2021,Area to avoid at all costs. Nothing recommendable. In an asphalt polygon between trucks and concrete with a lot of noise on the side of the road. At 10km (in Binaced) there is an excellent area!
21365,1267865,1,Maskabotes,21/06/2021,"Much noise, it is in an industrial area. The good thing is that it is close to laundry and has filling and emptying services."
21365,1267663,2,Lowcostporeldiy,21/06/2021,"We stopped to change both gray and black waters and without problem. Although we had to look for life because the taps to fill the water tank are not suitable for any nozzle, because they are old-fashioned taps to tighten. Located in a good area to buy or visit the city but not to rest or eat as it is next to an industrial estate."
21365,1219779,4,JensRonn,26/05/2021,"We spent one night at this place.  
Clean and quiet.  
There are several supermarkets, restaurants and bars close by.  Do not miss to visit Castillo de Monzon, it really an experience. Only a twenty minute walk from the car park."

21365,1125073,2,Didiruca06,29/12/2020,"No noisy area, next thing. It is in the middle of the polygon constant movement of trucks, the road right next to it and the train in the back, luckily they do not circulate at night. All this working day, I imagine that the weekend things will change but it also has no charm. The positive is the filling and emptying area with the containers just in front and the super."

21365,975668,4,salvana,18/08/2020,"Area close to the center, which has a nice castle. All the services work, a little left the area of the garbage containers. Thank the City Council for the effort to maintain this area."

21365,723869,3,abarketero66,17/10/2019,"Comfortable but noisy place. Better to make a stop than sleep. Clean and dirty water. Cheap gas station opposite and supermarket too. I went up to the sleeping lot, which is a much quieter place. It has a bar next door but is closed today. Much better than the Zarautz area anyway."
21365,715326,3,lukasundalina,07/10/2019,"Certainly not the most beautiful environment for such a place, but the place itself is well maintained and for a night or a small service stop more than adequate."

21365,465952,4,jpt79,24/04/2019,The proximity of the train line makes the 3 convoys that pass at night seem like a nuclear bomb if you sleep on a lift roof. But all very well. I wish all the towns had a similar space

No tap to clean the toilet so i was afraid ppl would use that tap to clean their toilet too. 5 minutes later this actually happened! So happy i decided to fill it up in another place. The restaurant is simple, but fine and cheap. For vegetarians like me there is not much choice but fried eggs and potatoes, but it did fill me up. Ask for desert menu!

21369,1213649,4,bb.stefkovic,23/05/2021,"Great complete service. Great location, lots of space. It's not much for sleeping, only if in an emergency, because it's on the highway and the gas station. Lots of traffic. Restaurant cheap, food okay."
21369,1134841,5,Omenigo,03/02/2021,Refilled all water and even showered for free! The food in the restaurant is super cheap and completely fine!

21369,1124674,5,javigd82,28/12/2020,"Magnificent attention in the sale of the dollar. They have a saying that goes from ring to finger: ""If you like to eat well and be treated with grace and sympathy, come to the Paco y María Dollar restaurant"""
21369,1124670,5,javigd82,28/12/2020,Extraordinary site. Magnificent attention in the bar and category breakfasts (XXL toasts). At night it has been a long time seeing that it is usually normal so do not panic hehehe
21369,1122258,4,gatavan,19/12/2020,Area for emptying and filling. Ample parking and there is a restaurant next door with good tapas. Gas station and next to the highway.

21369,1031687,5,nicolasxl,07/09/2020,"Fight right to catch up on everything. Water, gray and black. They should take note of other gas stations, restaurants ... Minimum investment and economic report to the locals in the area."

21369,940564,2,Terranova,08/08/2020,"Be careful as of today, the sewage discharge is overflowing, I suppose they will solve it soon."
21369,779743,1,Luzie2018,13/02/2020,We just wanted to get rid of it and it was really disgusting and dirty. Not recommendable.
21369,774771,5,Zoidberg,01/02/2020,Perfect for filling and emptying water.
21369,774564,5,beate11,31/01/2020,It is a rest area next to the motorway. The Venta Dolar restaurant is excellent with an excellent price-performance ratio.

21369,754885,4,cintadisa,19/12/2019,"They have a free shower asking at the sale. Clean service, hot water without problems, with pressure, plug. We had a beer and a wine that with the tapas they put with the drinks we were eaten for € 3.50. Very kind."
21369,438505,4,katy47,10/03/2019,"Aire that has the merit of existing, free but noisy, normal trucks are going back and forth otherwise nice, a pity that everyone lets go its dirt without putting them in the trash. This is where we begin to respect the earth and others"
21369,409029,3,TruyuX,20/11/2018,"Very much trash everywhere on the edge of the parking lot, but very clean and free toilets. It's more like a place to rest and I'm a bit scared of my car ... close to surrounding area not really worth seeing, but for one night as a stopover okay ..."
21369,294116,3,RBGELX,20/07/2018,"We dined in the restaurant, cheap and everything was great, although the treatment of a particular waitress did not please us, the rest very well. And at night we spend the night, the traffic of trucks lasts all night."
21369,238947,5,Skaiste,20/04/2018,FREE services. Clean and tidy.
21369,219280,3,ventures,18/01/2018,"We did step, excellent restaurant for 10 €, wine and coffee included. Drainage area unfortunately not maintained, bottles of plastics everywhere. What a difference with the cleanliness of the restaurant."
21369,210883,5,yvelise,12/11/2017,A service area as we would like to see more often. Very easy to access. Very friendly resort staff and excellent bakery nearby. By cons we did not dare to spend the night.
21369,197371,5,jejo,25/09/2017,Water load and discharge of gray and black. Free and well taken care of. Phenomenal.

21369,54305,4,alicris39,09/09/2015,Ideal for refueling and fluid exchange. All free. This point is appreciated en route. And this allows you to spend the night freely in the area and enjoy the places.
21377,2560126,3,smillaa,25/01/2023,"You're very off the beaten track, which is nice. There are other cars parked there overnight. It is very quiet and even in the morning there are hardly any surfers or swimmers. You really are there for yourself. But the way there is quite shaky and bumpy. That was still no problem for our old camper."
21377,2511567,5,SimonAndrews,03/12/2022,"We stayed here for 3 nights. Probably the best park up I have found in Lanzarote. No services and a 4 kilometre walk to the village, but it's a beautiful walk and the view and the tranquility make it worthwhile..."
21377,2507102,1,Kea19,27/11/2022,"A beautiful place, if the wind doesn't sweep around the corner too much... this morning the GNR came and said it's forbidden to stay in the nature park and stay overnight. Very friendly but they write it down with photos and send it to the head office. I don't know if there will be a post. You can easily stand in the parking bays, which are separated from the beach with wood"
21377,2500620,5,albabrm,20/11/2022,"Extraordinary views, magnificent sunset and a lot of tranquility. The best place where we have slept in Lanzarote!"

21377,2046427,4,gabye91,07/07/2022,"Spaces provided for parking but spaced from each other. Trash cans next to each pitch. Quiet and clean. On the other hand, the road is VERY uneven on about fifteen meters. We were in a campervan and we had a LOT of difficulty getting back up (it slips, there are a lot of holes, stones and sand)."
21377,1771647,5,CAELINAAAA,02/03/2022,Stunning place with incredible sunset and mountain views. Truly one of the most beautiful spots in Famara!
21377,1765124,5,etje,24/02/2022,even with wind and rain showers a fantastically beautiful place. if you walk further than the end of the road you will see a small sheltered sandy beach at low tide (low tide).
21377,1762991,5,janowski,22/02/2022,we spent one night in the car at this wonderful spot.
21377,1714961,5,Romanocamps,24/12/2021,"A wonderful spot! We went to the end of the road and were all alone with the sea on one side and the beautiful mountains on the other. 
Although: so. much. wind. maybe check a weather forecast before sleeping here to see how much wind there will be during the night.
No service."
21377,1681699,5,Jeannekisi,07/11/2021,"Perfect spot for the night, bumpy road to get there but quite passable. A lot of wind ! Magnificent view when you wake up with a view of the cliffs and the sea"
21377,1175996,5,MetaAzulEH,18/04/2021,"A simply spectacular place to sleep. On the beach, the site is very long and large. Deluxe."

21377,1048078,5,yunaKerignard,14/09/2020,"The best location for the sunset. Rough dirt road but worth the trip. No service. Peaceful place surrounded by nature. However, check the direction of the wind before spending the night there."
21377,918980,4,Pandanno,01/08/2020,Good place to park and enjoy an optimal beach
21377,801891,5,yunaKerignard,14/05/2020,Ideal location for the sunset. Uneven path but worth the detour. No service. Fairly windy.
21377,638543,5,Julijimb,18/08/2019,A great site! Access road complicated by potholes in some areas. Very dangerous beach for swimming due to strong currents.
21377,326195,5,cjmelian,11/08/2018,"We stayed in van, and we got a very good memory of the place."
21377,35276,5,fuertemac,03/05/2015,"One of the best places to stay in a van, ideal for surfing"
21377,31997,3,bounns,12/03/2015,"Parking land, quiet at night, surfer day, we sleep on the spot 15 minutes from Famarra with all trade"
21382,3265748,5,lupo2121,06/09/2023,Highly recommended!!! All perfect….
21382,3238372,5,AlainSDR,30/08/2023,"Campsite with a wonderful view. Van electricity 2 people 33 euros. What about this place? Paradise no, but we are not far from it. Location sea view if possible ask for 32 or 33 best. The toilets are more than adequate. The pitches are large but with lots of views like everywhere in Spain. You are a 15 minute drive to visit Almeria and well worth it."
21382,3176013,4,madugr,18/08/2023,"Very nice place. We were lucky and had a place right by the sea. Due to the heat it was very hot but that is due to the location. We were very satisfied. The supermarket had everything we needed. Sanitary was clean, but there is no security that ensures a good night's sleep. It was reasonably priced. The beach is rocky like most but clean."
21382,3091730,4,JuanVillanuevaAlonso37,07/08/2023,"It is not the cheapest campsite I have been to nor the best, but to spend a quiet night it served me perfectly. It also has a beach with exclusive access for those of the campsite that helps to relax. In other comments they complain about noise and also about heat. I was not affected by the noise and it is normal to find it hot in Almería, especially in summer. That if the ground is not straight"
21382,3070228,3,crocotrotter,03/08/2023,very good spot for the view and the proximity to the sea ... for the rest the pitches are shaded but quite small and the sanitary facilities are well maintained but aging .... 33€ per night for 2 with electricity
21382,3041264,2,RMLuepu,29/07/2023,Stayed here for one night at the end of July 23. The price of 40 euros is definitely too high. I've been to many places. Here the smallest pitches EVER found. WiFi doesn't work. Quiet as mentioned in many comments is out of the question. Mobile phones only moderately. I won't come again.
21382,2991034,3,U.Do,20/07/2023,"Womo length is crucial when allocating space, large Womos do not fit in all spaces. Lots of pitches with sea views. At 36 degrees, sleeping was almost impossible. Due to the shading device built too deep, the heat is in the camper at night. Without wind, the surrounding highway is very noisy at night. Otherwise quiet on the beach, no problem with a dog, relatively clean facilities."
21382,2988582,4,doadileti,19/07/2023,"Parking with large camper pitches, those near the sea that are certainly more ventilated, however shaded, private beach available, good services. Almeria can be reached well by bike in about 15 minutes"
21382,2888581,5,werwoolf,24/06/2023,"Campsite with direct access to the sea. Toilets, showers, electricity, water, washing machine available. Restaurant inexpensive and good. Lots of shade at the pitches. Kiosk was handled by us through the restaurant. Some staff speak English, the rest Spanish. Google translator helps. Paid €99 for three nights in the first row with electricity. 25 m to the sea."
21382,2868500,3,ericdeias,18/06/2023,"Family campsite with wheels in the water. Good covered pitches for motorhomes. Showers, toilets, outdated but clean amenities. Pebble and sand beach in the middle of rock faces. Road passes above the campsite but no noise pollution thanks to the waves. Nothing around but restaurant on site for troubleshooting. Campers and their cool dogs. We recommend without hesitation."
21382,2860150,3,FloMo730,16/06/2023,Everything that Camperhertz expects. Quiet beach and clean sanitary facilities. Only wanted to stay for the night. Then it became 3 nights. place great.
21382,2848754,3,BiancaVanlife2022,13/06/2023,"Nice location on the beach, nothing else nearby. Nice shady spots. After waiting 15 minutes at the restaurant I left. Shower neat but outdated, hot water also for washing up is a plus. I think 6.50 for electricity is a lot (only used the refrigerator), which means that I had to pay 26 euros for 1 person, 1 night"
21382,2825066,4,Mamsik,06/06/2023,Everything ok here. Partly overshadowed. 7-8m Womos no challenge. The sanitary facilities are cleaned regularly. No odor nuisance. Easy to reach service point at the entrance - not the exit. Rocky beach -- Shoes are an advantage. Come back here.
21382,2781305,2,CamperlifeSundP,24/05/2023,"Beautiful place, right by the sea! The staff was often not to be found. The reception was almost never manned. One always had the feeling of disturbing the staff while drinking beer in the bar. The sanitary facilities are getting old, clean; but with a bad smell. For the price of €35.50 for one night for 2 people, you would expect a different service."
21382,2777236,4,MNL23,22/05/2023,"A lovely quite site, with beautiful sea views, we were plot 33 right on beach front. Dogs allowed on beach so extra bonus. Facilities were all ok. Enjoyed 2 nights here."
21382,2712788,4,beb-lu,01/05/2023,"Super well located campsite, frequent buses in front of the campsite for Almeria (€1.35). Ideal pitch 29 under the eucalyptus trees (=birds=caca on van) no big deal because it is so nice to take advantage of the natural shade and breathtaking sea view .small nice beach, it just lacked the umbrellas seen on photos.correct sanitary facilities but sometimes unpleasant smells of evacuation.very nice staff."
21382,2705801,4,michaelCid,29/04/2023,Very clean facilities. Great little bar / restaurant. Great if you have your dog as it's allowed in the beach ( clear up behind them for other users please). Friendly staff. Me and monster will def return.
21382,2701846,3,jojoguitare,27/04/2023,for the view 3 stars location 53 super on the beach but! for the men's showers no comfort but nice hot water to redo with your girl for the idyllic setting excessive price 33€ for 2 electricity
21382,2672591,5,Rona1234,15/04/2023,"A place with a lot of charm, clean and very tasty food in the bar there. We were in the first row on the pebble beach, including the sound of the sea"
21382,2620964,4,Meringa,23/03/2023,small campsite in a wonderful cove. place is spectacular.
21382,2609672,5,AndreasBrodien,14/03/2023,"A dream with the flair of the 70s! I wish it stays! The people are friendly and nice, the restaurant offers Spanish delicacies! Gladly again!"
21382,2597499,5,Appetute,03/03/2023,"A quaint little campsite in a small, quite narrow bay. The valley is crossed by several bridges, but on the front pitches ""in front of the first bridge"" you don't hear the traffic at all, only the sound of the sea. You have the bay with the pebble beach to yourself. The sanitary is older, but clean. Restaurant also TOP and cheap!"
21382,2588074,5,MariaG.,23/02/2023,"Top place. Small but nice. In a bay right on the beach. It's like a little private beach. Some places are covered or covered with sun sails. Some are directly overlooking the sea. Still found it a bit pricey 2 person 2 dog motorhome with electricity. I ran with the dogs to the right through the dry river bed. According to the neighbor, salt water comes out of the showers"
21382,2570108,5,Polo0621,06/02/2023,Campsite right by the sea. Sanitary facilities are clean. Restaurant or pub only available for camping guests. If you go there you have to be aware that it is not a typical tourist place. It's Spain. It could use a refurbishment. But perfectly fine the way it is now.
21382,2568098,5,Dokker0308,04/02/2023,"A great place right on the beach, sanitary facilities clean and sufficient. Gladly again"
21382,2562528,4,EsmeraldaMazzu,28/01/2023,"We had already come in February 2020. Excellent welcome. I had fitted out an access ramp to the sanitary facilities (I am disabled.) so well that we have just come back to it. Location near private beach. We have a 7m long motorhome. No problem. toilets and very clean campsite. 33 €, but the 2 small dogs are free."
21382,2560693,1,chauvetfrancis,26/01/2023,"This campsite is not even worth a star, the places are too small in width and height, the accesses are narrow, to avoid absolutely, 33€ in January, with salt water showers, it is really abusive."
21382,2557123,3,vero191171,21/01/2023,"Good welcome by the sea, some pitches very good, others on a slope. Unfortunately at times it smells of sewage"
21382,2552025,5,PrebenLauesen,15/01/2023,"A really nice and peaceful place. Direct access to the pitch's own beach, many pitches with a direct view of the Mediterranean. The facilities are really good, both bathing conditions and laundry facilities. A small ""supermarket"" and a cozy restaurant, where you can pick up the nicest pizzas, among other things. Five stars from here."
21382,2550594,5,Susemichel,13/01/2023,"Just beautiful, right on the beach. Costs EUR 33 per night with 2 adults including electricity Slightly sloping terrain, so the pitches are slanted and only suitable for shorter campers (up to 6m). Fill up with water and go shopping beforehand. We will be back definitely!"
21382,2548487,1,mandyundholger,10/01/2023,No Service at All. I have been riding my bicicle for 12 km to empty my toilet. It Was not even possible for Money.
21382,2540830,2,Awol,04/01/2023,"Very expencive place, rather sloped.
The staff was not very professionel and kind of rude.
Up to 33€ per night for one person."
21382,2528718,4,zitta79,26/12/2022,"I'll start by saying that it's the most expensive campsite I've found on my trip to Andalucia, but the place is lovely, right on the beach, quiet, peaceful, beautiful sea, a really nice place. The pitches are very sloping, I struggled to get the caravan level, had to place some nice boulders underneath. The bathrooms are old but functional."
21382,2519460,4,bushilde,11/12/2022,"Great seat, especially when you can stand up front. Unfortunately there is no tumble dryer."
21382,2491673,5,SpainPort,12/11/2022,"Fantastic. Some parking spaces small but at 5.5m perfect for us. Nice people. Great private beach. Services spotless. Showers excellent. Bus at top of road to go into town, although we did not do this. Other campers welcoming.  Highly recommend for 33 euros for one night for two of us."
21382,2470164,5,coraline31,29/10/2022,"Not at all bothered by the road for us (we are 4 adults and all of the same opinion), pretty beach with beautiful bottoms for snorkeling. We tried the restaurant and in particular the paella (excellent!), clean sanitary facilities and the small + bus stop at the exit of the campsite. In short, I recommend it with eyes closed."
21382,2427080,1,auroresom,06/10/2022,"sea view. small location. salt water shower, which either does not drain or is cold. we stayed 2 nights 2 people and 1 van 66€..."
21382,2408745,5,JuergAndres,28/09/2022,A paradise with pitches right by the sea. Ideal for morning swimmers. A perfect place to relax for those who are looking for peace and quiet.

21382,2362570,3,KatjaLenz,11/09/2022,"Yes, ok for 1-2 nights. There's nothing nearby. In itself, the place looks really nice. You just have to watch out for these poles on the squares. And no idea how to get out of there when all the seats are occupied. It's great that the beach is right in front of the door. Restaurant was difficult but tasty."
21382,2329792,1,M.Rouses,01/09/2022,refrain from capuchin motorhomes. They made us go around the campsite twice even knowing that there was nowhere to fit... campsite very uncomfortable to maneuver. The beach is also nothing to write home about...
21382,2283007,4,JeanAymeric,22/08/2022,"Family campsite with a beautiful little cove. Clean toilets. I don't understand the reviews that talk about the noise from the road, it's close but frankly it didn't bother us. I leave a star for the water of the showers which is brackish. Plan a small cream if you have sensitive skin."
21382,2098654,4,leanne73,20/07/2022,"Atypical campsite due to its location, beware of large motorhomes because the places are narrow. We spent two quiet and relaxing nights there."
21382,2096662,4,Jakou16,20/07/2022,"A great place, with a private beach below! The pitches are more or less spacious, shaded, and the sanitary facilities are clean. The campsite is on the side of the road, so relatively noisy, especially with the resonance of the bridge."
21382,2025245,4,BerndRudde,30/06/2022,"The bay is indescribably beautiful. The campsite has a nice atmosphere. Everything you need to feel good is there! BUT: The work on the rocks in the background, especially the drilling, gets on your nerves. Supposedly they take place all year round (?). That's really a pity! And shop beforehand! Addendum: We don't work on weekends! We stayed 5 nights"
21382,1996136,3,enda_c,20/06/2022,"Nice place right on the beach. Good facilities with very nice, warm showers. Plots are a little tight but nicely covered. One downside is that it's a 10 min drive from Almería with no bus in. Quite expensive with a 6 euro charge per person on top of camper fee."
21382,1994463,4,jillyandbazza,20/06/2022,For our 1st ever Motorhome site we stayed on it gave us the WOW Factor.  Right on the beach it was lovely.  Needs a little TLC but facilities all good and clean.  Met some wonderful people and fab little bar.  Not much else around so being prepared is a necessity.
21382,1978996,5,manuchao,15/06/2022,"Small but very well maintained campsite directly on the sea, impeccable services, Wi-Fi, camper service, washing machine, restaurant. camper and two people with electricity 29 €.

21382,1867536,4,Borrax,03/05/2022,"The campsite is charming. It is on the beach and for the location and distribution it earns points. Van, two people and dog €24~. The facilities look vintage and the restaurant is fine. With beers at €3 with a lid. (somewhat expensive) and with a menu at €10 without drinks. The biggest problem is the limited offer of hiking, bike routes... that the area offers."
21382,1841288,1,Tinetine72,20/04/2022,"Nice campsite with your feet at the water's edge, but very little warm welcome... unpleasant even..."

21382,1828677,3,Manni0815,16/04/2022,"The campsite is not the most modern and the sanitary facilities are not impressive either (salt water). The bay or the beach lets you forget the ""inconveniences"" directly. Just a dream when the weather is nice. Fresh water supply is a problem. 20€ per night with ACSI."

21382,1807547,1,Eibol,05/04/2022,"I cannot comment on its facilities since when I arrived, everything was a problem, firstly because of the measurements of the motorhome, I have a normal 6-meter profile. And then when he said that we had ACSI, he told us directly that he had no places, and from the entrance you couldn't see people inside."
21382,1801015,2,LakesideMaggie,30/03/2022,We found the staff at reception and in the restaurant to be rude and dishonest.

21382,1781995,5,bea13120,13/03/2022,Good for 1 night but plots a little small and difficult to access. Friendly staff and reasonable off-season (07/03/2022) prices: €21.94. Too bad the weather was not right to enjoy the nearby beach.
21382,1774562,2,viveloscolores,05/03/2022,"The price for a motorhome and one person is €17. The plots or at least the one they have given me are dirt and sloping so they force you to put the chocks. The site for discharge of dirty water is small, the filling of water (NOT drinking) the camping beach is not a big deal, stones and nothing cared for. The bathrooms and others are very good. I have a slight smell of sewage."

21382,1709955,1,phil696,14/12/2021,"plots on the beach are ok but the one I had was small and on a slope very difficult to get in especially over the stubbed high curbs, the showers are hot if you turn the tap to cold and you have to leave your belongings outside the cubical, the restaurant was closed no supermarket 1 washing machine and 1 tap for water which is very slow, if you book this site ask what plots are available"
21382,1701716,3,dancooke616,02/12/2021,Beautiful location right on the beach. our only complaint is the showers use sea water so you come out of the shower smelling like stagnant sea water its kinda gross. I wouldn't mark them down for this if not for the expensive price tag €40 for 2 people without electricity is extremely expensive. would expect pristine facilities for this price

Restaurant, very good everything we ate. To put a downside is that although it is close to Almería and Aguadulce you have to take the car. There is not much shoulder to walk or bike. Nor buses, otherwise I liked it. We will repeat"

You are spoiled for choice: either you stand near the beach and are squashed like a sardine in a can or you have a slightly higher space and have the noise of passing cars all the time (Autovia and main road are directly above the campsite! ). We paid 22 € for 2 people and a camper."

But the toilets are trashed and disgusting, there is no supermarket and no possibility of walking anywhere. There are pitches that are car park size (4x2m), hilarious. Hopefully you have one with a tree in the middle or the cable does not reach the electricity socket (there are only two or three). Very careless"

On the weekend the campsite is a bit of a disaster in that regard, the beach is public and there are people who cross the campsite and use the facilities without control"

21382,939055,1,maitaitxi,08/08/2020,The worst place we've ever been. The management of the campsite is disastrous. The pitch they assigned us did not match what we had reserved and the only thing that matters to them (also without any shame) is if you have paid them even if you are in questionable condition at their campsite. We will never return here and I recommend that people stay as far away as possible.
21382,879148,2,T3lastedition1655,18/07/2020,"There are covered pitches for shade. Sanitary is ok so far, but for the money it might be a little better. We paid electricity € 27 for the 2 person bully."

21383,1712739,4,UweGreim,19/12/2021,"We were here 6 plus 2 days. The place is very well managed, the sanitary areas cleaned 3 to 4 times a day. The pitches are big enough and sunny in winter and shaded in summer. The staff is very service-oriented. Supermarket and restaurant are fine. Deductions in the evaluation because of the location and the poor wifi, or internet reception. Bicycles are recommended."
21383,1696005,3,AlbertSaar,22/11/2021,Very out of the way. 2km to the beach and 3km to the next shop. Of course there is also a small shop on the square. OK for us for 1 ... 2 days. 20 € with acsi otherwise over 30. I find a lot of money for the system.
21383,1667626,3,vanhomi,29/10/2021,"The large campsite is about 40 minutes 'walk from Cabo de Gata and about 30 minutes' walk from the sea. The place has a pool, a restaurant and a small shop. The sanitary facilities are modern and clean. The spacious plots are laid out with gravel and covered by a sun sail. Actually, the place leaves nothing to be desired, but is unfortunately very remote."
21383,1584466,2,alexgari,16/09/2021,€ 27.5 / night for an AC and 2 people. Large and clean toilets. Perfect pool. Very far from the town and surrounded by greenhouses. 30min walk to the beach. Slight edor from nearby marsh and sanitation.
21383,1555345,2,albolo,07/09/2021,"Gravel plots. They force you to hire the light. Price per night € 27.50 per day. Showers and toilets 7 out of 10. 15 minutes from the beach. Surrounded by greenhouses. Do not have breakfast in the restaurant! Very expensive, the milk was bad and they charge you things that they do not give you. Flies everywhere, very heavy."
21383,1547835,5,Carlosmunoz82,04/09/2021,"Spectacular! We have spent two days and everything is great. Few noises, very comfortable (in September). Activities for children in the afternoons and nights, the breakdowns that arose were fixed shortly. Price appropriate to the facilities. In July-August it may be that you get too small with a lot of people. We will repeat"
21383,1497150,4,apolloxi,22/08/2021,"A great place. Large pitches. Some nights there is live music or things like that but they finish at twelve, clean bathrooms and large showers but there are a lot of flies in the morning and mosquitoes at night. Pool with very cool slides and animation. We will be back !"
21383,1456416,3,Tritxe,14/08/2021,"I don't like camping that is so big, because the pool is too small, the bathrooms are scarce ... but there was no more, everything was complete. To visit the area very well."
21383,1335314,4,samuel.sanmor,18/07/2021,"We spent one night on the way to Cádiz, clean services and very good treatment at reception. Lots of flies and noisy during the day but at 12 all is quiet and you can sleep well. Practical"

21383,967158,1,Joti,15/08/2020,"Quiet little place for campers with loud music and party. The ac in the sun and without shade, to the beach walking 1/2 hour of sunny day by sand road. Price for 2 adults, two children and € 51 per day and to top it off while the children bathe in a little pool, they charge you 6.30 for a beer and a Coke."
21383,942055,4,maitaitxi,09/08/2020,"Practical and quiet camping in Cabo de Gata. Near the Salinas de Cabo de Gata, the Cabo de Gata Lighthouse and San Jose (Monsul, Genoveses etc). The girl at the reception took great care of us! Recommendable."
21383,912855,4,adriasabater,30/07/2020,"A well located campsite next to Cabo de Gata, but also to go to the beaches of Mónsul or Genoveses. We slept there with the van 2 people 2 nights it cost us € 32 a night. Better to call because the web shows a minimum of 3 nights. The bathrooms are awful and very clean. As it was a weekend there were a lot of people and a little noise at night, but we rested well."
21383,786123,4,JuergenD,24/02/2020,"With ACSI € 20. Lots of free places, that was very pleasant and rare in winter 2020, most campsites are full of noise. Reception speaks English and German. Everything was very clean, especially the sanitary facilities. Top showers! The only drawback: drinking water is only available via canisters on 2 very slow taps for pressing. At the other connections for hoses there is a sign saying 'No drinking water'. For 1 star deduction. And the area around the square is not attractive."
21383,747810,5,GG4831,27/11/2019,"Patron very friendly, the campsite is under renovation and we were welcomed free. We have just returned from a very good night, beautiful place. very hot water, excellent wifi. Very nice gesture that never happened to us. Thank you!"

21383,541899,1,rwansnn,07/07/2019,"Limited tourist interest. Presence of many insects, mosquito flies (linked to greenhouses?) So they sprinkle insecticide hedges every night, intox guaranteed"

21383,181060,4,rakelita79,20/08/2017,"Very friendly reception staff, good supermarket, pool is very good and entertainment too. The bar offers several combined dishes and tapas at a good price. The excellent cleaning. The beach a mile away. The night cost 37.5 euros plot of 70 m2 with light two adults a child and the baby free. The only fault was the noisy neighbors with the loud music until twelve."
21383,171448,2,yramos,11/08/2017,"We went to load and unload water and they told us that it was an exclusive service for clients, we have to sleep at least one night. The receptionist was not very friendly."

Natural park ideal for walking dogs. For car hire prefer Interrent or Goldcar (airport) much cheaper than Kisacar offered by the campsite."
21383,120101,4,Challenger74,14/02/2017,Very satisfied with this campsite. Water electricity and evacuation on the comfort sites of 70 m2. ACSI card accepted even on these sites. Price 21 € instead of 29 € the night. Sanitary very clean nothing to say. Ridiculous supermarket and no animation. Possibility to rent a car via reception but be careful Kisacar are thieves. Vehicle delivered 3 hours late without justification
21383,82688,1,Korde,17/07/2016,"Small camping, the reality has nothing to do with the web, zero services, zero care, shadow with plastic if you're lucky .... In the super in the middle of July says it has nothing because it is low season! . PATETICO, I arrived, I saw and I left (it lasts 5 min)."
21383,62678,3,aoucel07,17/01/2016,"Clean campsite, a good welcome. We were there with a motorhome of 10 m. They have multiple locations. Nice and close to the sea."
21383,41065,1,ste3371,08/07/2015,"Impossible to make water (tap without the possibility of attacking the water pipe with drip supply !!), too many flies and moschini despite the many traps, very little shade, the store is not open at the times indicated, but according to the needs of the operator, the pool can only be used in part because it is used for a canoe course, if you are lower than 3.20 you can stop in the shade of green networks, otherwise parked in the sun. The sea is 3.5 km away and can be reached by a small road that runs along abandoned sheds. The village is 2.5 km away and apart from a few bars and a pharmacy there is nothing else. The star of judgment is for the sea which is very beautiful all along the coast."

21384,3112260,4,Canijitos,10/08/2023,"A very good campsite, good pool, clean toilets and most pitches with good shade. Due to the parking of cars in the streets of the plots, the maneuver can be difficult. The beach is about 10-15 minutes walk from the campsite, but the path is quite bad, at least for small children."
21384,3066339,5,ixia721,03/08/2023,"Quiet and family campsite. The toilets are very clean and there is a small area for children, a playroom, play areas and activities. We recommend it.

Nothing to do around.. left the next day"
21384,3020246,5,dvalderrey,25/07/2023,"Some plots with more shade than others. We were very hot, I recommend bringing a fan at night. Cleaning could be somewhat improved, being complete when we went, it shows that more cleaning rotation is needed in the bathrooms. cool animation. Great pool. Handy supermarket. The beach is very hot and it is not recommended to walk. we will repeat"
21384,2997888,2,LUCIA1999,21/07/2023,Typical camping atmosphere with a lot of noise. To go to the beach 20 minutes walk or 5 minutes by car. They have a pool and restaurant.

21384,2875690,1,emiber,20/06/2023,"Awful. We have had to change plots several times due to noise. It is not controlled at all. Infinite large groups of children and adolescents placed throughout the campsite screaming all day and until late at night. More than a quiet campsite, it is a youth camp. They would have to warn him to decide to stay or not. we will not return"

Very well connected, they also offer you routes with departure and arrival from there, it is not worth risking the fine for sleeping in a natural park."

Yes, it has flies and they sometimes get on your nerves. Nevertheless Los Escullos is highly recommended."

We really liked a well-kept, beautiful place with very friendly staff and a recommendable restaurant. If you have an e-bike, you should use the tarmac path to the beach. Unfortunately there were a lot of jellyfish in the sea, but the place can't do anything about that."

Better not to comment on baby baths… dirty. €36 Camper."

Unfortunately the toilets and showers were under renovation and the campsite was full of tourists.  The toilets and showers were inside a container and were so inconvenient that we decided to rent a bungalow.  We hope to return when the place is more pleasant.
21384,1861333,3,lauge,30/04/2022,"Spectacular surroundings and decent campsite. But for the money they charge it is lacking. We paid €31 per night for two adults and two small children (<6 years) with electricity. Part of the facilities are under construction and the pool is only open during weekends so I feel that is a bit steep. Also, they have no spot for filling drinking water on your car, so we had to leave without water :("

21384,1774629,4,ParkPriscilla,05/03/2022,"The posted price of €9.90, which is often criticized here, is accurate. That's how much a mobile home with one person costs without electricity. That's what the posters say. There is a great place for that in the national park."

But there are also nicer places there. The sanitary facilities are neat and clean, the washing machine and dryer are also great. The drinking water from the tap tastes awful. Gym has to be paid extra."

It is clear that it can happen anywhere"

The restaurant is not at the level of the campsite, it leaves a lot to be desired in quality-price terms. And of the two nights I stayed, the first I did not sleep at all thanks to a dog barking until 5 at night"

Following the change of manager, the customer service has disappeared and only seems to count the receipt of funds. There are now in cabo de gata spaces for motorhomes much more attractive and less expensive than this campsite."

To finish we stole clothes hanging. I will not repeat. Finally the beach is not 300 meters, it is 1 kilometer and 300 meters. The campsite is recorded and made uncomfortable."

Fresh water is 4€ but if you at the same time fill gas for at least 40€ you pay 2€ for the water. Odd thing: you are supposed to emptying grey water on the ground where the motorhome area is. They told us to do so. Straight onto the asphalt. A bit odd but still a very good place to fix all the things mentioned above.

Light interruptor. Plots with trees. Sensational. Bar with food service, daily menu, highly recommended and very rich. You have to visit it and learn the history of what was a great mining town. 100% recommended"
21396,1854421,1,HaMoSprinterVan,26/04/2022,"It's a pity that the campsite is closed this week due to a closed party, but you can't reply to an email or announce it on the homepage. The information didn't reach us in a friendly way either. It's a great location and would certainly have been nice there, but you can't just drive up there or go past it. Too bad."
21396,1726887,2,Ibidahi,05/01/2022,Nice campsite in beautiful surroundings. The Sendo Las Menas de Seron is interesting and recommended! 29 euros per night for 1 person in a camper seems excessively overpriced for the space.
21396,1709054,5,AngelPellicer,12/12/2021,I have spent two nights and the truth is that I am very comfortable. Very good treatment by the staff
21396,1455263,3,viensonlefait,14/08/2021,The road to get to the campsite is fantastic. Very friendly staff. Very small swimming pool (you have to reserve a passage slot) the children's games are in the restaurants and the huge trampoline has created some frustrations since it is more secure… the hours of silence are respected (midnight - 9am) apart from that huuuuurle treeeees strong! From 9 a.m. to 11:59 a.m. It is very surprising that campers are so disrespectful.
21396,736490,5,Olliz,02/11/2019,"Excellent rural camping, very familiar treatment, highly recommended to eat, make routes, visit mining town, and has a children's area. Very careful and expanding."

21396,400631,4,ANTERO,28/10/2018,Camping in an ideal place with trails for sports lovers. Everything very clean and very good attention. The only downside is the narrowness to access the plots above with a Camper and that there was no coverage of Lowi and Orange in the campsite.
21396,248961,5,patpeanuts,08/05/2018,"Very welcome, friendly, cool, the owner is warm and available. Hot water at will. Three nights in the mountains super calm. Interesting hikes nearby."

21396,80639,5,seiken,10/07/2016,"They do not have yet to empty the gray water, but it is in project, even so it is a super recommendable place to spend a good weekend. It is in the old mining town of the ores which can be visited. It has restaurant with good prices and splendidly attended. I will repeat without any doubt."
21399,3286176,4,tobi83ddpark4night,11/09/2023,The parking lot is completely okay. The toilets are clean and open all night. Spent a quiet night here. The town of Rupit is well worth seeing; the hotel bar was still open in the evening. We think the €14 overnight parking fee is reasonable. From Rupit it is worth taking a nice hiking tour to Salt de Sallent via Sant Joan de Fàbregues.
21399,3285381,2,Davizyyo,11/09/2023,payment and the water filling is not going
21399,3191662,5,himmelauferden,21/08/2023,Was quiet all night (Sunday - Monday). There was some traffic as the bars closed before midnight. Toilet is open all night and clean. A mirror is missing from the washbasin. Note separate parking fees for mobile homes. The day changes at 12:01 am. Thanks to the Rupiter community for this great place.
21399,3188500,1,web_van,20/08/2023,"The place is a shared parking with places for motorhomes. The problem is that in the Camper tourism brochures for the area it says that the price is €7 per night but pricing starts at 00:01, that is, if you arrive at 8pm you pay €14! to sleep!! Badly explained. Not to mention the concert that was held until 5am with very loud music... the worst night of the summer... We won't be back"
21399,3186131,4,Brotdose,20/08/2023,If only drinking water was available. Unfortunately still out of order. Everything else was great!
21399,3131333,3,JOJUSA,12/08/2023,nice place to spend the weekend and thank Rupit for thinking of people who travel by motorhome.
21399,3092993,5,susanaponce,07/08/2023,"Great place, quiet at night, during the day full of cars that visit the town, but there is the possibility of a picnic area where it is quiet. Ideal area for hiking."
21399,2776751,2,KarolineKompany,22/05/2023,"A parking lot where everyone parks, some picnic tables and dirty bathrooms. Although the enclave is ideal. You pay by the hour. But if you spend more than 4 hours they will charge you 7 e and if it goes past 00:00 they will charge you another 7 e integers per night."

21399,2697297,4,JonBasaldua,25/04/2023,perfect parking to visit Rupit and spend the night. around €14. paid electricity and only 4 points. Very quiet night and nice place
21399,2681453,2,FuOnTour,19/04/2023,"Very nice place and good hiking opportunities. Unfortunately the prices are wrong. 7 € is the daily rate. Whoever stays overnight pays 14 €. Electricity is extra and water wasn't working when we visited. In addition, a height scanner is installed at the barrier, which classifies larger mobile homes as buses. It doesn't show that and we should pay 15€ for one night in the parking lot."
21399,2627069,4,jasmineraye,27/03/2023,"Lovely quiet place to spend the night. It says about paying for electricity however we plugged ourselves in and had it for free for over 20 hours, so don’t put any money in it without trying first! 4 stars because toilets aren’t great but they’re open 24hr and available to the public. One night = €14. Will definitely be back!"
21399,2624542,3,daniyfany,26/03/2023,"good place to rest. 24 hour toilet service. very quiet to spend the night there are picnic tables, ping-pong table and some good benches next to the river to relax or read while listening to nature"
21399,2598363,2,Macsea,04/03/2023,"Parking for vehicles in general. There is a discharge of gray and black but it is shared with parking spaces. The water, on these dates, does not work. There are 4 light sockets."
21399,2597718,5,lizazoe,04/03/2023,A phenomenal place to camp very well and free electricity with all the services next to it is recommended and a man in the area is very friendly
21399,2563300,3,nubbecita,29/01/2023,"To fill it was covered and to empty there were parked cars. They also charge by the hour, not by the night. We arrived on a Friday at noon and left the following afternoon for €14 without water or electricity. The one in Cantonigros is much better, €5 a night with light included (4 shots) with gray water service. Although it is far from rupit. But to spend the night much calmer and better"
21399,2561409,5,alextrn,27/01/2023,"The services are unfortunately down but will be fixed. Possibility of emptying gray water all the same. Extremely quiet parking, very close to the village which is absolutely amazing. The bakery opposite is awesome, great cheese and great bread!"
21399,2558158,4,sandmarcamper,22/01/2023,Good place to spend the night. Very quiet in a beautiful town. We paid €5 from 5pm to 11am

Do not hesitate to walk towards Salt de Sallent from the village, breathtaking view blast around a 100m high waterfall"
21399,2503690,5,melina0211,23/11/2022,Superb place! I recommend for nature lovers and hikers… very quiet place we spent 3 nights there! Relatively decent price for the frame!

21399,2484901,4,falajaltrips,06/11/2022,I give it four stars because the water filling does not work and there are no indications (a worker told us that it has been for more than a year and returned the lost coins). The rest perfect.
21399,2473465,5,Papulote,31/10/2022,"Fewer showers has everything. Clean, spacious and safe place as well as quiet. Right in front there is a restaurant and a bakery-cafe where you can wake up with a delicious homemade croissant and a coffee with milk. The beautiful town!"
21399,2467332,5,shaldonkoolma,28/10/2022,"€14 if you stay overnight, but €21 for 2 nights 3 days.
Gorgeous town. Free grey and black waste disposal. Pay for water and timed electric, although when we plugged in the electric was free and unlimited. Electric uses a standard European 2 pin plug (schuko),not the usual .
Very quiet overnight. Barrier controlled.
Cooler in the hills.
Recommend approaching from North C-153, too hairy from Sau."
21399,2450116,2,Jolleva,18/10/2022,"It is an area that is excessively expensive, you pay for everything, €7 from 0h. at 24h. separate services. I recommend stopping to spend the night in it. are from Cantonigròs, which is about 8 km away. There are four plots with electricity, all included, they are €5, it is a 5-star area."
21399,2446670,4,RojAleo,16/10/2022,"Magnificent place, magnificent night. Next to a river and the town. It has picnic tables, sinks and gray and black drain. A beautiful and perfect enclave. After reading the comments regarding the payment, in our case, we arrived at 7:10 p.m. Saturday October 15 and we have left Sunday October 16 at 1:15 p.m. total price was €5. We're going in a Volkswagen Caravenelle van."
21399,2426437,5,diver69,06/10/2022,"A very nice place with a super nice waterfall, we spent a very pleasant, quiet night and made a super nice hike to the waterfall... gladly again."
21399,2301243,5,Sanoral,25/08/2022,"We have arrived on a rainy and stormy day and there was no light in the town. The car park access barriers were not working. Speaking with the people of the town, they have indicated to us that they have enabled an access through the exit of the parking lot. It is somewhat narrow, but it has solved us being able to spend the night."
21399,2290690,4,iallavall,23/08/2022,"The town is very beautiful. The place has open toilets, picnic tables with nice views. At night we heard the young man and in the morning the people who came to visit the town. During the night we slept very well."
21399,2286377,4,ideatika,22/08/2022,"If you are going to visit Rupit it is worth spending the night here. It has picnic tables, sinks and water."
21399,2240977,4,carmentege,15/08/2022,"We spent 1 night (watch out because, as they say, if you come in one day in the afternoon and leave in the morning they charge you ""two"" days). It is a very busy car park during the day (if you come by car, it is better to arrive in the evening as there will not be so much traffic and you will secure a place). playground next door. Municipal swimming pool nearby (€3.5 with possibility of shower). Some problem at the exit of the parking lot (and no one attends to you...)"

21399,2166413,1,teklasjess,03/08/2022,"The area very well. The charge is a scam, we have been less than 20 hours and they have charged us €14. If you enter at 00:01 until 24:00 it is €7 (for 24 hours), on the other hand if you enter before 00:01 they charge you two full days even if you are less than 24 hours!!! That's how the government team decided... what a scam. Better to sleep in any other area or parking"
21399,2129076,4,jorgemgallon,27/07/2022,Very practical. Spent 1 night. All services were very good. Toilets very clean. Just a bit of noise from cars in the morning coming and going through the parking and the route next to it.
21399,2067991,3,nightinaparking0207,13/07/2022,Very good parking to spend the night. €5 for around 00-11am. Free toilets. The drinking water service was HS.
21399,2011344,4,XeviPA,26/06/2022,"It's a fantastic place to spend 1 or 2 nights, in a great town. Good gastronomy, several restaurants to choose from. With the possibility of taking routes through the town, don't miss climbing the bell tower, it's worth it. Starting point for excursions, the best known being Salt de Sallent. I don't give it 5 stars, because it's already the 2nd time we can't fill water. Empty blacks and grays no problem."

21399,1759640,4,moments2009,19/02/2022,Beautiful mountain village. Short hike to the sheer cliff and Salt de Sallent waterfall with sensational views. Now in February no tourists. In summer and on weekends I would avoid the place. There are only five dedicated spaces for RVs to share with coaches. We had to pay 14 euros for a 23 hour stay. For whatever reason.
21399,1738841,4,Pitufdez,22/01/2022,Good place if there are no people. We arrived at 7:30 p.m. and we were alone. We spend the night and get up to go on an excursion. At 12 noon we arrived and the parking lot was full. The services had no water. Parking price for 5pm: €5.
21399,1736631,3,coshotas,18/01/2022,"The área is nice  near the river and right at the entrance of the village.

It has only one turret with 4 sockets for the light, a couple more turrets would not go wrong, € 1 / 1h of light, we were lucky and the machine worked without coins. Services and discharge / loading of water. We have spent a very quiet and great night to visit Rupit and do his routes"

21399,1332396,3,JotaCePe,17/07/2021,"Improvable. To begin with, charging € 3 / day to cars and campers and € 7 / day to ACs is meaningless discrimination, not justified by length (if it were proportional to that, it should be over € 5) or by water service, since it is paid separately. In addition, the seats for AC are on a slope, although some of the others can be occupied without a problem of length. Otherwise well."
21399,1308479,4,maskdos,09/07/2021,Municipal parking at the entrance of the town. Asphalted and with marked squares. € 3 per 24-hour camper. Toilets open all night and area for emptying and filling (I think for a fee). Quiet area next to the river

21399,1214439,3,supertrump,24/05/2021,The parking is fine but I think that 7 euros for parking is simply a robbery.
21399,1184355,5,aliciagm,03/05/2021,A beautiful town. We have spent one night for € 3. We did the walk to the Salt del Sallent and of course some shopping in the town shops. Right in front of the parking there is a cafeteria with an incredible oven.
21399,1180627,4,Alexandraft,27/04/2021,"Little more to add to the rest of the comments. the town is picture postcard and there are millions of routes for hikers or mountain biking. The parking lot fills up on weekends, so get there early! electricity (only for 4 AC) was free but clean water did not work even with coins (it did not drain them) so we loaded water in Cantonigros (10km from Rupit)"

For the water, say that right in front of the Parking there is a swing park with a free drinking water fountain. To sleep flat and very quiet place.

We detected it as a motorhome because it put it in the ticket but when paying only € 3. It's worth the descent to the salt of Sallent.
21399,413386,3,alva68,10/12/2018,It is good to visit the village but quite busy and noisy
21399,412858,3,julyjor,08/12/2018,"Shared parking with cars, there is a specific area for motorhomes, but we went to the December bridge and it was too full of cars. The gray water discharge zone could not be accessed because it was occupied by cars and the water load did not work. At night it's empty and it's better. To spend a day is fine, but not much else."

21399,128667,5,martaabu,17/04/2017,"Good place to spend the night. You have to arrive soon, or very late as it is full of cars (in Holy Week it was to open). You are right at the foot of the village and you can eat there. You can also empty gray water (less when there are cars because there is no space) and sink and fill water. You can make excursions or simply relax. Overnight quiet. 5 euros."

21400,2518400,1,molly95,10/12/2022,Unfortunately unable to park at the moment
21400,1145267,2,goribf6,02/03/2021,Adequate parking for a night's sleep but noisy
21400,1120744,4,MarcisYSira,11/12/2020,"We slept 2 nights midweek and terrific. In the early mornings you can hear cars arriving, I suppose to work in town, but they did not take us away from sleep. Very central."
21400,510331,3,bert198,10/06/2019,"The location is wrong, it sends you down a narrow street on one side of the bullring to a dirty gravel parking lot, the parking lot is where the main road on the other side of the bullring"
21400,427148,4,justy,06/02/2019,"We spent a night here and well, a bit noisy by the passage of people and cars but fine. the large motorhomes there are 4 or 5 seats in the center of the parkin."
21400,221276,2,yapagare,03/02/2018,"Parking very central, very small spaces, I do not think large motorhomes move well if there are more cars parked. ideal to visit the town."
21410,3286420,4,lafamilianr,11/09/2023,"Good campsite, it has everything you could want, bathrooms, clean showers, toilet, chemical store and restaurant, swimming pool. I have given it 4 stars because the motorhome spaces are quite inclined and muddy, otherwise it is a highly recommended campsite, I would return again."
21410,3284287,4,FB96,11/09/2023,"We spent one night there. Nice place with an uncomplicated bus connection to the city for €1.85 per trip. 2 people with a VW bus and electricity cost €39. Good sanitary facilities, but no toilet paper in the morning."
21410,3282447,4,ivopolli,10/09/2023,Were on the big meadow for 2 days because all the other places were fully booked. Place was great for 2 nights and for sightseeing in San Sebastian. Bus goes directly to the campsite.
21410,3270190,4,Max96,07/09/2023,"Booked online one day in advance. Worked perfectly at the reception, which was always very friendly. Even the largest squares have narrow entrances and almost all of them are sloping. Nice pool, very good sanis, shop for everything you need. Bus every 30 minutes directly in front of the door for €1.85. I found everything very ok."
21410,3255829,3,larakrgl,04/09/2023,"At 50€/night (2 people with a camper) quite expensive for the fairly simple and densely populated campsite. There is a pool and the sanitary facilities are well equipped, but in my opinion the price/performance ratio is not entirely appropriate. The bus connection to San Sebastián is cheap and reliable, it works great!"
21410,3254407,3,hippielotta,03/09/2023,"Actually a nice place but chaotic organization. Allocated and paid places were already occupied, the place organization at the reception was done with pieces of paper and highlighters, nobody knew which places were still free. Unfortunately, some places were extremely crooked, and the shower later in the evening was only lukewarm. Good and cheap bus connection to San Sebastian, delicious croissants in the shop."
21410,3243672,4,grandcalifornia3000,31/08/2023,"Very friendly, competent lady at reception (speaks fluent English). No problem getting a good parking space at the end of August. Very modern, large and clean sanitary facilities. The bus runs every 30 minutes directly from the square to S. Sebastian for little money. Nice playground. Shop and rest not used. Points deducted because of mediocre WiFi. Highly recommended for exploring San Sebastian."
21410,3226670,4,Ivonnchix,27/08/2023,"Very nice camping, clean, beautiful environment. Be careful with booking online, I did a mistake and booked a camper place (we were with tent), payed also for electricity,  us a result got a tent spot without electricity (unfortunately no refund). nice restaurant,  good bread and croissants in the morning. Easy bus connection to amazing San Sebastian. Loved it."
21410,3224943,2,annamf,27/08/2023,"Practical campsite to visit San Sebastian, the 16 bus stops right there and leaves you in the center. Of course, expensive for what they offer, €96 for two nights, very small plot and the second day we had to shower with cold water after a rainy day that we wanted a warm shower. The next day we complained and they told us that they had had problems with the gas... small emptying area, you have to wait."
21410,3222833,4,WimLiesbeth,26/08/2023,"Nice campsite, very expensive but there is no better alternative here. The place we were assigned was difficult to get in and out of. A very smooth connection to the center by bus."
21410,3201023,3,borovan,22/08/2023,"We were in the outer zone because the inner zone is complete. Narrow but grass pitches and for the toilets you must enter the campsite. Quick access and a few minutes. But by bus you are in the center of San Sebastián in 20/30min and in high season there is a bus until 00:00. And if the big week coincides, then there is a bus until later. Very practical"
21410,3198503,2,RunninGhost,22/08/2023,"In the high season you almost only get something outside. it was ok for us, but you are really very close to the others. and with 42€ for 2 adults 2 children not very cheap for that."
21410,3191491,4,campervanrooijen,21/08/2023,"Great campsite! Nice new showers and very clean. Helpful employees. Satisfying. I just think that if you are on the outside field with the camper, the experience is less. In any case, we enjoyed the swimming pool with the sun beds and the beautiful green campsite."
21410,3163754,3,sannni,17/08/2023,"We stayed for 4 nights and we extended one more. Extending the stay has created chaos, the workers are not coordinated, they assign us a plot that was occupied, they give us a new one, and the same day in the afternoon a receptionist in he comes to ask what we are doing there that the plot was reserved by a customer, we followed what they told us and even so when we left we were not found in the database, we were attended to by 4 different workers who each told us something different, the campsite is quiet 30 minutes by bus Prada next to the campsite you plant in the city, large plot if you touch inside and it is with electricity those without electricity are below everything and you have to go up a super climb, we were there all 5 nights but we noticed little coordination between the workers..."
21410,3151865,2,giudy81,15/08/2023,"Pitch of adequate size for a 5.4 van but in a very humid position and wet ground, almost impossible to stay outside the camper. Nice swimming pool but very cold. Clean bathrooms, fountains present. 56€ for 2 adults 2 children and a van without electricity."
21410,3136435,1,chiara1012,13/08/2023,"To forget and avoid!! 51 euros in 4 without electricity, they put us in an outdoor rest area in a tiny space. The pitch designated for us was already occupied by a car, but it was too small for our vehicle. We booked and paid online (the only positive note as it is impossible to do this in most of northern Spain), but there was no notice of the type of accommodation."
21410,3133800,1,patrick7878,13/08/2023,rip off! I reserved before (50€) and was put on a field outside of the camping with no bathroom on a very little spot. Nobody told me before on the reservation hotline.
21410,3121559,4,marcotaiana,11/08/2023,"Absolutely too expensive for what it offers: camping on a hill quite far from the city with pitches not suitable for campers. On the other hand, there are no better alternatives and to reach the city there is a public bus that runs every half hour."
21410,3097886,3,bia24,07/08/2023,"Adequately sized pitch with electricity. There is no water on the pitch (and I have not found any fountains). Good toilets, but could be cleaner. We didn't try the pool due to lack of time. The campsite is quiet, well connected to the city by bus."
21410,3078109,4,Fussyfish,04/08/2023,"Large Terraced site, very popular, book ahead or you’ll get put on a field outside without amenities. Not many camper/tent pitches have electric but we got one and enjoyed our stay. Fantastic for visiting San Sebastián with regular bus outside. Excellent amenities"
21410,3077823,1,palbp,04/08/2023,"Not worth it. We are leaving ASAP. We paid 54€ for an improvised space. To make matters worst, we called in advance telling them we were arriving on a 7.5 meters long camper-van and asking if there were any vacancies left. They told us to come in, not letting us know we would be placed in an improvised space. If you are riding a camper-van use this place only as a last resort."
21410,3066031,1,arjanx,02/08/2023,"Not recommended. We were on the other side of their camper area, but had only 1 meter of space to sit along our camper. We spent all day staring at the side wall of another camper. We therefore left again after 1 night. Also paid more than € 50 for 1 night !!"
21410,3063551,2,CampovoloFree,02/08/2023,"High price for what should be called a quasi area (€43/night for 2 adults and one child), zero services in the same parking area, having to cross the road to access them, not level, hardly any coverage, Wi-Fi does not reach to most of the campsite and no shade, friendly and predisposed staff that does not compensate for the quality of service / price."
21410,3052202,1,Dinocampervan,31/07/2023,"we paid €40 for one night, two adults and two children. the space felt more like an RV park than a campsite, with manned pitches and overworked staff. Worst value for money I have come across."
21410,3043280,1,Ripo80,30/07/2023,"Very small plots, they do not allow you to remove the awning or set up a table, in addition our reserved space when we arrived was occupied by another person, a lack of control at reception, each one occupied what they wanted ..., bathrooms and showers very far from the assigned area that It's practically outside the campsite, it's like an extension without services, luckily it was only impossible for one night to stay for several days."
21410,3035626,5,MJD80,28/07/2023,"Fairly new campsite. The pitches can be a bit small, but not all of them are. Our camper placed 7 meters on a pitch with a tree in the middle. Went fine. Nice shady spot. No problem if you want to switch pitches. Friendly staff and nice places. We paid €70 in high season per night for 4 people. We used it for transit to Barcelona."
21410,3030330,1,Bojema,27/07/2023,"The pitches are very small, muddy and sloped. Booked for a 70m2 pitch, on arrival we were assigned a pitch that our motorhome (6m) did not fit on, with a tree in the middle preventing us from putting out the awning. We pay 60€ per night and stand in a muddy, sloping and minuscule place. Anything but a clean, tidy campsite, don't go here!"
21410,3024977,3,TheMintBus,26/07/2023,"Not good for the very small, narrow, partly unkempt pitches (tall grass) outside the campsite. Sanitary facilities are good, the shop is small and has the essentials. The pool is nice. Bus is right in front of the camping. It was ok for one night, I wouldn't want to stay longer. 39€ 2 pers/AC/electricity"
21410,3019950,3,EricC38,25/07/2023,"Small pitch down a hill, for van only. The CCs are piled up outside the campsite. Fresh swimming pool. beautiful and clean toilets. I would have put more stars if I hadn't paid €45 per night for 2 adults and a child WITHOUT electricity!!! the positive thing is the bus to go to San Sebastian."
21410,3017121,4,dantas33,25/07/2023,Very good campsite with very good facilities and services. Try to book the day before or come before 5 p.m. because there are a lot of people in this sector
21410,3014325,5,jsb,24/07/2023,Good option to visit Donosti. AC 4 people €34 in the outdoor area. I recommend it.
21410,2998173,4,ikaruz02,21/07/2023,Solid campsite. Some standard pitches (e.g. F17) have a little bit of sun and are damp for a long time when it rains. An upgrade to the slightly more expensive seats is recommended. Sanitary facilities clean. Very well located to visit San Sebastian by bus.
21410,2977091,5,saradedo,17/07/2023,"Spent 2 nights 7/14-15/23. Super nice girls at the reception, there was no place on the campsite and they made us park in the rest area. €37 per night for 4 adults with the possibility of using all the campsite services and with electricity. We could have moved in for the second night but preferred to stay put. Bus every 20 minutes to San Sebastian. All perfect!! Well done!"
21410,2966378,5,karosien,15/07/2023,"Great camping near San Sebastian! Two campsites separated by a road. The restaurant offers basic tasty dishes. Access to toilets from the campsite by the reception, from the second one you have to cross the road. access to the center every 20 minutes by bus ticket cost 1.8 EUR. NOTE: Do not go to this campsite guided by navigation because the roads are narrow and very steep. best to get to place SS"
21410,2960227,5,T5roadsurfer,13/07/2023,"Very nice campsite with great, modern and clean sanitary facilities. You can get to San Sebastián quickly and cheaply by bus. 31€ per night without electricity with the VW T5. There is also a small shop where you can buy a baguette and croissant for breakfast in the morning. We were very satisfied and would definitely come back for a visit to San Sebastián."

21410,2949221,3,Fmang,11/07/2023,Stayed on an empty field by the other side of the road.  The camping looks nice but since we were outside it doesn’t feel like you are staying in. It has some structure for camping car but 42 euro is too expensive for an empty field by the road.
21410,2938983,4,wholeofthemoon23,08/07/2023,"Stayed here for 1 night in the field across from reception (very quiet!). Good facilities on the campsite itself of which we had full access (great coffee in the cafe). We paid €43 for 1 night with electricity, 2 people and a dog, but I’ve read that others have paid more. For Spain, €43 seems reasonable. Minuses - no soap in some toilets and field offers no shade. Plus - stunning views!"
21410,2920005,3,familytrip23,03/07/2023,"60€/night w electricity. Small pitch. For some reason no hand soap at toilets (which is strange considering the price). Small playground is okay. Pool is more for adults. It’s okay, but not for that price"
21410,2824676,4,Bettika,06/06/2023,"Good starting point for visiting the city. Camping clean, pitches rather small and cramped. Expensive for what you get and highway within earshot."

21410,2778220,4,Niekdefender,23/05/2023,Nice and very clean CP. There is also a parking space across the street. Great bus connection into town. Perfect for us and can't quite understand the prescriptive.

21410,2483079,2,ElyaneBuonemani,05/11/2022,we spent 1 night there at 25 euros without electricity we will not return despite places available on concrete he offered us a location on the grass between the tents difficult access to empty toilets clean but rustic
21410,2464341,4,SandraRic,27/10/2022,"Nice place. We are 7.50m long and 3.20m high. There is also space for this in the first ""street"". With ACSI, electricity was free."
21410,2457957,4,Katka74,23/10/2022,"The campsite lacked nothing at all. Only if you are traveling with a larger motor home is it a good idea to walk around in advance and choose a plot that suits you. It takes a bit of maneuvering skill. Otherwise, great accessibility to the city."
21410,2455670,4,markvs,22/10/2022,"excellent campsite, good organisation, nice swimming pool, stop around the corner for a direct bus connection to San Sebastian. Sanitary is clean, there is a baby bath. Downside: the pitches are quite small. we stayed here in the middle of September and the end of October and liked it both times."
21410,2444340,4,lolalu21,15/10/2022,"Very good for us. Straight pitch, everything easy. Washrooms in order. Only a sidewalk to the nearest restaurant would be good. Otherwise great place for a city trip to San Sebastián. Unfortunately no good hiking opportunities, but the Camino can be reached via smaller roads. Paid €25 for one night."
21410,2431599,3,RalfundEvs,08/10/2022,"Were there with a camper (7m) in early October. Pitch with electricity and water on site. The sanitary facilities are great and deserve (5*). However, the pitches are so narrow that we just had space with our camper. The lane is narrow and maneuvering must be skillful = parking lot. Water connection cannot be used on site, as there is no threaded or plug-in connection."
21410,2424788,4,Friegelow,05/10/2022,"In September we got a pitch with our mobile home on the outside area with electricity (campsite was full). For showers and toilets you have to walk across the street (you can only get through the door with a code), these were clean and tidy. Seats are a bit tight. The bus into town stops right at the campsite."
21410,2407456,3,valou0304,27/09/2022,"We went there earlier this month. Warm welcome, but no place at the campsite. we are therefore offered the CC area for the same price with all the services of the campsite included. area with very tight pitches, it's a shame and in full sun. Bus at the foot of the area to be able to visit San Sebastian .. very practical."
21410,2405689,3,elkehansel,26/09/2022,"The actual square is characterized by aging huts. Tents and mobile homes are rather narrow, the sanitary facilities are older. The camper place across the street is on grass, partly has hedges and nice pitches, which is highly recommended. Absolutely quiet despite being so close to the road."
21410,2373793,4,europatourdreen,15/09/2022,"You could choose a place yourself. We had 1,5th place, but there was no other way ;). Also had no reservation, but the field opposite the campsite. We preferred standing there (at the very back, horizontally) paid 30, - pn including electricity / water / waste discharge etc. Given the place (privacy) we stayed 3 night. Toilet/showers is across the road at the campsite. Bus to San Sebastián, was perfect+cheap. Receptionist called dentist, very nice :)."
21410,2370971,5,MatyHerrera,14/09/2022,"We have spent 2 nights and phenomenal. Very attentive staff and very good facilities. They gave us a plot in the area within the camping quite large. There is another outside area but it is removed from all services. 60 euros with light. There is a bus every half hour to go down to the La Concha area. At night when we returned there was no longer a bus, but x 13 euros you go up by taxi."
21410,2369889,4,paulinou21,14/09/2022,"Campsite quite out of the way but well served by the bus line every 1/2 hour which takes you to the city centre. We paid 30€ 1 night 1 van 2 people. Very clean toilets for men and women separated. There is a small supermarket in the campsite, a swimming pool, a restaurant to stick. I recommend this campsite!"
21410,2359722,3,joki68,11/09/2022,Positive bus to St Sebastian. Disadvantage during the week the last bus leaves at 21:30. Places in WOMO area very small. Once we ran out of hot water around 8pm. Space too expensive but not bad for lack of alternatives

21410,2332543,2,wilsoncamper,02/09/2022,"Actually, he would have earned more stars because it is a beautiful place visually BUT: the parking space was extremely uneven (we didn't even get to the level with our wedges) the showers were not particularly clean and strangely designed (shower heads cannot be adjusted) one of the receptionists was extremely rude... only stayed there one night and then left straight away"
21410,2310540,1,FernandoR,27/08/2022,"Very expensive park 35 Euros to spend a night for two people without electricity, to access the bathrooms we have to cross the street and access the campsite without shadows and with little space to put a table outside or open an awning. To narrowly avoid sleeping in a nearby hotel"

21410,2295434,4,Campinglover21,24/08/2022,"Actually a nice place, but really much too expensive. We were in the ""upper"" area, a slightly better parking lot. Sanitary facilities ok, although could be cleaned more often. Wash off cold only. Nice pool. Bus to San Sebastian runs every 30 minutes right in front of the door. Restaurant and mini-market available. We paid €35/night for 2 adults."
21410,2279209,3,telmabaole,21/08/2022,"very expensive but conditions suitable for a night with all commodities. The spaces without electricity in the below left side are very quiet and spacious. In high demand, during August at least. Direct bus to San Sebastian with a good schedule."

21410,2256503,2,MarineClap,17/08/2022,Small and above all very expensive location. We paid €60 for one night with a small van without electricity. The campsite is still well maintained and the sanitary facilities are clean. It is still very very very expensive!
21410,2249421,3,Hermance516,16/08/2022,"Good location to get to Donostia by city bus. We were on a traditional camping pitch but the plot was a little too steep and others around were even steeper. Well-kept campsite, but gray water drain for Motorhomes a little difficult to access if you exceed 6.5 m. long. quite high price"
21410,2211601,3,BjoernBjoernson,10/08/2022,"No reservations possible on the other hand they have enough room for everyone. However, we camped on the grassy pitch outside of the campground, which is locked off at night. The next toilet is a long way but it is a good place to visit Donostia for a day. Bus stop to the city centre right in front of the door. Got a shady spot no electricity and a bit cramped.
1 night: 2ppl 1van: 35 Euros"
21410,2204131,4,ackcosta,09/08/2022,"Wonderful camping, very good and affordable, restaurant has some pizzas to order that are the best, all the necessary conditions, transport to the beach or center, we give 4 stars for a single problem, the outside area is very tight for caravans, everything else It's wonderful, I advise"
21410,2175308,1,Coleen32,04/08/2022,"Campsite with complicated access, sloping and difficult to cross. With an old van impossible to go there."
21410,2162593,1,DiePeanuts,02/08/2022,"If you could give 0 stars, this place would definitely deserve it. As a ""short-term guest"" you will be parked for €40 on the opposite parking lot. The sanitary facilities are far away and not even clean. No soap, not a single dispenser filled with disinfectant. The only positive is the location to San Sebastián and that is just exploited here."
21410,2152529,3,Heidemarie_Diggi,31/07/2022,"Beautifully situated, natural campsite, pitches but quite small. We reasonably fit in with our 6.40m long camper. The vehicle should not be much longer. Showers clean but not always with warm water. 50 euros per night clearly too much for the service offered. You can easily get to San Sebastian by bus, definitely a worthwhile visit."
21410,2150215,2,havanita,31/07/2022,"We had to queue for half an hour and then spend the night in the outdoor parking lot for 52 euros (2 adults, 3 children). The restaurant is not recommended. Slow service, large beer 4.90 euros and baked pizza 12 euros."
21410,2148796,2,Fabio59,31/07/2022,"Not suitable for large campers, the staff assigns the pitches without taking into account the length. We with the camper 7.5 wanted to put us in a small pitch with a tree in the middle. Excessive price"
21410,2140582,5,samara85,29/07/2022,"Great camping, the best thing is that the bus is at the door to take you to the center and also has the return at 11:05 p.m. so you have time to have dinner and come back! With children essential El Monte Igueldo!"

21410,2138213,2,hh911,28/07/2022,Very clean sanitary. Super easy access with the 16 bus stop in front of the campsite to visit the city. Otherwise negative point you have to fight to have a correct location! Reception staff not very friendly. We were twice allocated a pitch for a van even though we have a CC of 7.5 m. They do not take into account the dimensions of the vehicles given at the time of booking.
21410,2129735,1,rodrimoreno,27/07/2022,"We arrived at the campsite to ask about the availability of plots, all complete, but he offered us the possibility of sleeping in the parking lot for €35 without being able to set up anything (table, chairs, cooking,...). An abuse, of course we reject"
21410,2118763,1,rgarjur,24/07/2022,"We arrived around 9:30 at night, we asked if there was a place available and they told us that for a van yes, we waited more than half an hour in the queue at the reception to tell us that there was no place in the campsite that we could leave them in a room for AC that was very far from everything, they charged us about €40 a night to sleep in a parking lot and we had to leave before 11 We left."
21410,2115503,4,Rocky3174,24/07/2022,"Good views, nice pool, clean facilities. Small shop very limited, but good bread. Very small pitches - we were fine with a camper but car and caravan outfit wouldn't have much room for awning/table.
Very good bus service into Donostia right outside the gate. Average price for coastal Spain."
21410,2101344,5,Howls01,21/07/2022,"Camping with super correct services. Clean bathrooms, hot water in showers. Swimming pool. Plot with a lot of shade and level. There is a bus service that stops at the entrance of the campsite and leaves you in the center of Donosti. You can buy the transport subscription card at reception. They informed us about it and it was great for us. They are very nice."

Taking the bus to San Sebastián is perfect. At the reception you can get 6 or 12 journey cards with which you can easily check in. Had to pay € 65 for a place with water and electricity. Long queues at check-in!"

Located on a mountain, place surrounded by greenery! Great panorama! shadow available! Reservations recommended. Otherwise, if necessary, space on the upstream meadow without comfort! Baby bath for whatever reason not freely accessible. Key at reception, currently lost."
21410,2091270,4,pitsid,18/07/2022,"We 2 adults and 2 children paid 48€ with electricity per night in the high season for a small pitch (across the street). With a pool and some child care I think that's ok. Unfortunately, you first have to cross the street and a security gate from the separated parking space to get to the sanitary facilities."
21410,2076516,3,miandefrana,15/07/2022,"Nice. In acceptable conditions. Expensive: 50 with everything included (also electricity). They give you the option of parking in an area in front of the campsite, on the other side of the road, for €40 but it only has water, drainage and electricity. For bathroom and laundry you have to go to the campsite. Some shaded pitches. Long queues to check in. Very comfortable to go to San Sebastian by bus."

The parking spaces are very small, we just got in with a 6.40m bus, larger campers were diagonally in the plot. Water connection is a matter of luck, every pitch has a different connection, some of which are quite unusual. Small shop, bar, top sanitary facilities. Good for visiting the city but very cramped."

21410,2035289,4,fronthauber,03/07/2022,Good: Very clean and well-maintained place. Bus right in front of the door and you get straight into the city (1.85 euros per person). Fresh breads in the shop (were good) and these weren't expensive either. On Sunday there were even croissants. Free WiFi. Bad: 45 euros without electricity. Pitches just tend to be crooked. Partially broken doors in the ladies' showers.

21410,1995672,1,monk50,20/06/2022,"Do not trust ACSI's comment. I put one star for clean toilets. Apart from that, any campsite.... Swimming pool correct but not heated, reception not smiling and not friendly, and as for the restaurant what to say ..... when we arrive we are given the cutlery and we manage to find a table, very little choice when it's on the menu, short average quality ....."
21410,1962677,3,sarahschu00,09/06/2022,"The campsite is really nice and big. The bathrooms are nothing to complain about either.

The staff is friendly and the ""neighbors"" are also very nice. All in all one cannot complain."
21410,1943662,3,JimogHelle,03/06/2022,"Ok place, a bit narrow on the roads to the pitches otherwise nice pitches with shade. However, it is a bit difficult to get rid of greywater as this has to do on the other side of the road."

The black water one is a bit uncomfortable… It has plots with water service and normal plots. The streets are narrow. But all very well. Yes, it is very expensive but with ACSI you have a very good discount."

21410,1813447,4,Rafikis,10/04/2022,"The campsite is fine... some plots better than others, but normal. The bathrooms are clean although half reformed. The bus service is magnificent: from the door every 30 minutes directly to the center of Donosti. Important! Access: follow the signs to the campsite = always along the Ondarreta beach. Any other path is inadvisable."

The ones for M were good and new, for F probably not. Parking and unparking can be a bit more difficult for larger campers... Otherwise, a wonderful starting point to get to know the great city of San Sebastian, we definitely enjoyed it!"
21410,1795896,4,SylDor,26/03/2022,"The site itself is fine for visiting the city of San Sebastian. The campsite itself does not exude an atmosphere.

It is unacceptable and they must fix it."

Made me pay for electricity when I didn't want it and imposed a crappy spot near the trash cans. They are abusing their monopoly."

You never do!"

However, we were there out of season and were almost the only ones on the pitch, but we found a lot of 33 euros / night! 5 euros for the washing machine and 3 euros for the dryer, also quite a lot. You have to book the pool online. Facilities otherwise very clean. At the reception you have to be lucky to meet someone friendly. In the restaurant, however, the woman was super friendly and accommodating, even if the food was just okay. Coffee machine for 80 cents was again a plus. There were also bus connections to the city. If you want to fill up with water, you have to consider that the German hose connection is too big. Overall very good, but we didn't feel very comfortable."

With a dog you can't go on the bus to visit San Sebastian. So another measure for nothing. We will ignore that in the future.

And the toilets are separated from the toilets. To wash your hands you have to go out and go to another building. I do not recommend this campsite.
21410,371971,4,hiace92,12/09/2018,"Very handy site. Buses to town (last return 22.00?) some comments here point to small plots, (true); sloping pitches (true, it’s on the ridge of the coastal cliffs; expensive (yes but are you really going pay less just near one of the most priciest resorts on this coast? It’s two hundred metres from a three Michelin star restaurant!) on the whole we thought it it was good value and a top way of seeing San Sebastian. Very clean, nice staff good facilities. >>>>> The only downer is the camp bar/restaurant. They’ve to Northern European rules without telling any one. If you turn up at normal Spanish dinner time, ie 20:00 onwards you’ll find there’s not much left. Go into town or maybe try one of the other restaurants along the ridge road instead!"

The reception was not very pleasant. And the price ! For a van, without electricity and 1 person: 19,20 €. In December .. And finally, the places! I was given a place that leaned on the front and on the right. Impossible to stay there. I went around and I did not see any better. So I went straight away, the staff seemed mocked .."

After my installation, the same employee asks me to move to a place where the back of my camper is in the driveway. I have no explanation for the reasons for this decision. I make the security risk and she tells me that it's like that and if it does not suit me, I can leave. Yet many places are available.

We are repressed more and more. so do not go back to PORTUGAL and especially not on the Algarve.
21439,452357,4,delpouve,11/04/2019,"Great place, no police in sight, very quiet."

21439,325945,5,Nicocecilehippo,10/08/2018,"Prefer this parking rather than the one with direct access to the beach. Beautiful layer of sun. For your needs, equip yourself with a shovel or throw your papers because dirty in the pedestrian way"
21439,279552,4,martin.coutts,03/07/2018,"Okay for a overnight stop. A short walk into the small town. The public toilets that are between this parking spot and the other one listed are immaculate. We dumped our toilet cassettes and filled with water (threaded connector, you will need pliers to turn the tap on)."
21439,239576,4,pag30,22/04/2018,"Good to spend the night, quiet with tables available. This parking deserves to be better maintained"

21439,176278,3,IPalma,16/08/2017,It is not like the picture. It is paved. Well located to see the town that is beautiful. Right in the parking lot you can take a kayak to go down the river to the beach. Quiet.
21439,169065,4,Patitopa,08/08/2017,"It is a very quiet place, the town has a lot of charm and good bars and restaurants. Less than 4 km away there is a spectacular beach, the best we've seen. It does not have any service, only a few public toilets a few meters (near the park)"

21439,152007,3,Oaklet,15/07/2017,"Really quite good. Pretty by the river - best to park away from the water treatment building (stinky) A walking path goes through the car park and it does get quite busy with campervans but all vans respectful, clean. WC just outside. Some kids had a bit of a loud meeting for about an hr around midnight but that was all. Better than having to pay for a 4* campsite when all you want is simplicity"
21439,135945,3,luccio,19/05/2017,Super quiet place with public toilet at 50 meters
21439,135944,3,luccio,19/05/2017,Great quiet place with public WC at 50 meters.
21439,135061,2,jeboss,15/05/2017,Correct place for one night. Beautiful typical village and beautiful hiking nearby. Attention in the bottom of the car park there is a manhole and every quarter of an hour we shoot the hunt so bad smell.

21442,2584573,1,LeftBlank,20/02/2023,"Terminal ""works"" but it still gives no water. Counts the liters and nothing happens. Pitch very difficult to reach and not signposted. Too bad, but the area is totally neglected and almost useless. We drove on."
21442,2031975,1,Milcone,02/07/2022,"Not recommended at all, we only spent one night and they didn't let us sleep because of the music of the barbeque that didn't cut off until 5:30. It makes no sense to install a motorhome parking lot right next to where the berbenas are held. Access to the area leaves much to be desired, complicated and unmarked. To this is added that the area is under construction, lanes with a lot of land and the area itself neglected."
21442,1827012,4,AliciaBarba,16/04/2022,"A small area for 3 vans or caravans. It was free for us, and everything was great. Very close to the town. The road through this area in spring is very beautiful to travel, although it has many curves."

The machine does not work or give service. Informed the City Council so that they take measures and solve the problems. Thanks for the area but, you have to take care of it."
21442,1589377,1,belenes,18/09/2021,"Only staying overnight, there is no electricity because the machine to pay does not work. The water drain has tomato plants of being clogged in years, risk that if empty it goes out to the asphalt ... if you want to just spend the night it is quiet and excellent, but without more comforts or services."
21442,1361095,1,pollornices83,25/07/2021,Only emptying of gray. The water and sewage machine does not work. They could already fix it to spend a few days in the town and visit its surroundings. It is a pity that they leave these sites neglected after the investment made.

21442,888616,4,Monicaviajera,22/07/2020,"The water change does not work but the light does and it is free. You need shade and improve signage to the place. The streets of the town are narrow and also to enter the area, you have to go through a dirt road that seems private, so you cannot see the area. Neighbors turned to explain where the area was, very nice."
21442,764356,1,elibony,04/01/2020,"Good for the city council of Deleitosa for promoting the motorhome and giving encouragement to the people. We arrived in January and although we were able to use the area, the filling system was not operational. The coordinates are not exact, accessed by bordering the wall"
21442,652530,4,Naitxu,23/08/2019,"Quiet place to spend the night, a little noisy at night but for the farms around. The area is small with 3 shots of electrecity although there is some van or caravan. It is a point in favor of having the pool next door and good places to eat too."
21442,535677,3,Toyotomi,01/07/2019,"A suitable area as entrance or exit to the UNESCO World Geopark Villuercas-Ibores-Jara. Located in a secluded area of the town, quiet, with all services (emptying of water, cargo and electricity). Three marked places, maybe five in total. Access to the area is not completed, pending task for the City Council. The signage and the itinerary from the road is poor and can lead to serious problems, the neighbors are very helpful, very friendly and cordial."

21442,81274,1,virginiaher,13/07/2016,"June 2016 the area very well signposted but it is not working although there is the water column and the plug, it would only be worth to download grays and sleep. The village pool is large and has a bar where you can eat well and cheaply."

21442,74731,1,claude.auvray,26/05/2016,Too bad to lock between 4 walls in the middle of a village without much charm. The region is so beautiful. Well nevertheless for the water point.

Shame

21515,2698151,4,Reiziger14,26/04/2023,"Practical place within walking distance of the town, the cave houses, supermarkets and cafes. Don't expect a quiet night, you are in the city and therefore hear the sounds of the city. The place itself is fairly quiet. There is drinking water with good water pressure. People empty their toilet in the wrong place, it is not clearly indicated, but you have to lift the manhole cover. No shade. Restroom in the park"

21515,2677301,4,Ninisayan09,17/04/2023,Large place where everyone can be on their side! Convenient for visiting Guadix and its troglodyte houses! To have! The city with these shops and restaurants nearby.. We really liked this city!

Drainage and water practical but to fill up with water with a hose, provide a tip with serflex because no possibility with a screw system."
21515,2669708,4,ReinerReisdorf,14/04/2023,"Didn't stand in the place next to the supply, but with about 12 other campers in the large parking lot next to it. One point deduction for all the dirt and debris lying around the sides. But ok for one night, because close to town and safe. But please, dear campers, do not let gray water run out at night, there is a disposal point for that!"
21515,2663580,5,Mikaeldu35,12/04/2023,"It was supposed to be just a stop for water but finally we discovered this city with 1000 surprise. The houses carved into the rock, a magnificent canyon, the cathedral. Little crush on this city. Extremely quiet night. We slept like babies."
21515,2646185,4,quicoiari,07/04/2023,Pretty good. It is close to the center. We spent a quiet night. It was difficult for us to find the point to empty the water because it is a very large esplanade. It is right in front of the buildings where you can see a fountain. We add photographs.
21515,2639282,1,Zagal75,04/04/2023,"Guadix visited and it is not worth sleeping here, it is a plain that is all dirty, as are its closed monuments and an authentic dunghill. I don't leave a single €"
21515,2629860,4,mfmundle,29/03/2023,An ideal place for a visit to the city and the hobbits. The youth meets here but everything is okay and quiet at night.
21515,2629427,4,gach,29/03/2023,normally the motorhome pitches are located on either side of the emptying area at the edge of the street occupied by parked cars also many motorhomes are parked inside the fairgrounds I spent a quiet night there seems tolerated emptying and filling top thanks to the municipality
21515,2624583,2,karyon,26/03/2023,"I drove 26,000 km over the last year and a half. But this was the worst night I've been to. I slept here from Saturday to Sunday. Until 3 in the morning, drunken people wandered around the road and hollered, cars drove, honked their horns, revved their engines, drifted and played music at full blast. An absolutely powerful night. I do not recommend this place at all on the weekend if you want to sleep."
21515,2624160,4,aanaa_1992,25/03/2023,"First of all, thank you for a place like this where you can have services. However, my score is low because the faucet has a push button and does not allow the tank to be filled properly."
21515,2623640,4,AnneCharlin,25/03/2023,"Arrived Saturday market day, many cars parked in the spaces reserved for c cars, verbalization by the guardia of passage In France this is unfortunately not the case"
21515,2618252,4,lupat,21/03/2023,"A large car park with spaces accessible to large CCs. Very convenient for getting to the center and the troglodytes as well as for visiting the surrounding villages. Many restaurants and shops with a warm welcome. A big thank you to the guide of the house, museum in the center of the troglodyte village. A little noise the first night but not disturbing. The 2nd very quiet. I recommend."
21515,2618097,4,HelmutMeyer,21/03/2023,"Large, straight parking space with supply and disposal. The parking space is within walking distance to the city center. Thanks to the city for this free overnight stay."
21515,2616873,4,kristine1960,20/03/2023,"Service area at the entrance to the car park, gray water toilets, clean water filling."
21515,2616636,2,NanoCatSammy,20/03/2023,"When we arrived on Sunday 2pm all the official motorhome places outside of the ""fairgrounds"" were being used by cars so we parked inside the fairgrounds with about 50 others. 
It is very dusty, people and cars running around & racing until early hours of the morning, dogs barking, constant traffic on the dirt track.
The dumping and refill area is clearly marked but is cross contaminated!"
21515,2608671,5,satur26,13/03/2023,"Perfect area to visit Guadix. Very quiet area, near the city center, free services. Thanks to the municipality. Really worth seeing."
21515,2604483,4,celineundTimm,10/03/2023,"Free VE on the street. Very centrally located. We and all the other campers stood on the large fairground (during the week). When we were there the night was very quiet, but I could imagine that the place is mainly used by young people to meet there with their cars."
21515,2602099,4,Chantal33,07/03/2023,"Great car park to visit Guadix, experienced with much less traffic than today. We thank the municipality for welcoming us in this way and operate the surrounding businesses. Do not hesitate to go and taste the churros con chocolaté at the café le versale because they are delicious."
21515,2601543,5,RosayJorge,07/03/2023,Beautiful town of Guadix! We were very comfortable in the area Thanks to the town hall and its people!

21515,2596257,5,pisacampos,02/03/2023,"A good place to sleep, we spent one night and visited the town, it has filled and emptied gray and black water, very central to visit the town very well, thanks to the Guadix town hall, thank you very much"
21515,2594679,4,SteffiWittig,01/03/2023,"We stood in the large square behind the actual RV parking lot, had a quiet night. V/E in front of the square, we didn't use it, but it seemed to work. Good for exploring the city on foot, about 20 minutes walk to the cave district."
21515,2590034,3,budajDominique,25/02/2023,"Saturday morning 8 a.m. market day especially do not park at the back next to the chapel because all the asphalt part is used by the street vendors, otherwise they settle in front of your CC that day installed you completely at the bottom on the left on the earth."
21515,2582375,3,saverio64,18/02/2023,"the bare minimum but it helps. on the side of the road so quite noisy. yet the city is worth the detour with its residential district, its cathedral and its alcazaba."
21515,2578713,3,SimonSarahSumo,15/02/2023,"Motorhome parking full of parked cars, so around 50 motorhomes and vans parked up in the fairground behind. Some young lads in cars not a problem. Quiet overnight and easy to park midweek. Services hideous. Despite someone marking the black waste point the drain right under the taps was blocked. Emptied cassette but didn't feel comfortable about the taps for fresh water. Ugly place but useful."
21515,2576836,5,CyranoFlea,13/02/2023,"Large free car park with services. What more ! Visiting Guadix is very good, but it would be a shame to miss Gorafe. A 30-minute drive away, parking with a view and 2 hikes with magnificent landscapes over the city and the canyon. Really great!"
21515,2573575,3,celenotaygete,10/02/2023,"The services is therefore in the street itself, with a few parking spaces for campers next to it. But the large square behind it is where most campers are. Had a quiet night, but during the day quite a bit of passage and noise (on the side of the bridge). Close to the center and the cliff dwellings are worth seeing."
21515,2573559,3,bimo08,10/02/2023,With the coordinates I ended up on the wrong side of the river with my Garmin (very narrow streets).
21515,2567437,3,hybe32,03/02/2023,"Very convenient for visiting the city and filling up with water and emptying. Go to the barrio de las cuevas, an extraordinary troglodyte district that is really inhabited and very extensive. It is indicated in the city. Go up to the mirador in this district, you will discover an astonishing landscape."
21515,2564574,3,Paul001,30/01/2023,Very loud park up with cars reving and playing music. facilities are not signed so contamination is quite possible. Great location for exploring the town though.
21515,2564218,5,klapet,30/01/2023,"The above pictures are still up to date. VE there, what more could you ask for! quiet at night. Top place to explore the city"
21515,2549141,4,MirellaLorenzo,11/01/2023,"The parking is not the best I've seen, free water, the good thing is its proximity to the center, also about 50 meters away there is a restaurant, Río Verde, where you can eat very well at a very acceptable price, very good parking to visit Guadix"
21515,2548234,4,Mazika,10/01/2023,Ideal to visit Guadix. There is garbage because they set up the market there on Saturdays and the street sweepers don't have the life to clean everything. If you are not a fussy the place is cool for a couple of nights.
21515,2544215,3,gutierrez2307,06/01/2023,Good location to visit the center. On Three Kings Day there were quite a few cars parked in the AC squares. At the fairgrounds there were also ACs parked. It is not a pretty place to spend the night but it is practical to visit the town that is well worth it
21515,2544050,1,garcade,06/01/2023,The emptying and filling of water is disgusting. If you can use another place do not come to this point. I thank the City Council for its good intentions but it could try a little more and put it in better conditions. It is very difficult to use.
21515,2543217,3,bopa,06/01/2023,"large car park, the camper places are occupied by cars. we did not sleep here afraid of the noise of the carnival. the location is ideal for visiting the caves and the city"
21515,2541875,3,ts_thesTig,05/01/2023,"Level, hardstanding. All services (except EHU). Funfair adjacent and can be noisy. Cars often park in designated motorhome spaces. Very close to town centre. Thank you to the community"
21515,2541654,4,leiremclouis,04/01/2023,"If the area is occupied by vehicles. The emptying and filling area needs a fix, especially in the taps. There is plenty of space in the fairground area. The town of Guadix is charming."
21515,2537345,2,climbercamper,01/01/2023,"The taps are not in good condition, but it is functional and free to empty and refill."
21515,2533029,1,ferlojo,29/12/2022,"To the town hall: The initiative is appreciated, thank you for taking us into account as another sector of passenger cars, but..., not everything is setting up an area, let me explain, upon our arrival, and despite the area and prohibition signs, we find ourselves with most of the squares used by cars, a mini fair placed just behind the area itself, and the water filling taps in poor condition."
21515,2525945,4,JuanaPena,21/12/2022,"All the services. Plenty of space and quiet at night. Although there was a small fair next door, it ended very soon and there was no noise."
21515,2518134,4,Haiosii,10/12/2022,ok but dirty and wery noisy place. Please empty your shit under the lid on ground !!!!
21515,2517785,4,MarcAndreu,09/12/2022,we spent one night and everything was fine
21515,2516434,2,Sergioteam31,08/12/2022,thank you to the municipality for providing black and gray water drain water for free 1 night on weekends unfortunately I do not recommend very noisy in the evening in the parking lot and in the morning hot air balloon departure pretty but it makes noise.
21515,2510644,3,Azanobini,02/12/2022,"Lots of people parked, safe but quiet place I really wouldn't say. Now there's also bumper cars! Good for sightseeing but then I left"
21515,2504561,2,jubiaventura,24/11/2022,"Thanks to the Guadix town hall, an area very close to the center and quiet, we spent one night without any problem."
21515,2502027,4,Sigkatzu,21/11/2022,"Certainly not the magic spot but very well placed, close to the city. 20min from the troglodyte houses. Bakery nearby and functional services. Rather quiet at night, however I will not stay on weekends."
21515,2500591,1,vivi252,20/11/2022,"Stood here from Saturday to Sunday. Hear battue in the evening (shots and barking dogs without end). At night, young people drifted in the parking lot right next to the mobile homes until 5 a.m. and from 7 a.m. two huge hot air balloons were loudly inflated. All in all a terrible and sleepless night. There is 1 star for the large parking lot and the lots of space."
21515,2499360,4,padraigl,18/11/2022,"Official motorhome Aire that locals use for parking their cars but you can also park inside the fence in the very large espalade. Perfect for the town.
The services are ok. Can only do the black cassette waste while no van is parked in the service area.
Confusion over the cassette tap as seen people use both taps. Best to clean the threaded fresh water tap before use.
Stayed 2 nights."
21515,2498427,2,MMCfamily,17/11/2022,"I'm giving it two stars because it's thanks to the town hall, it's also very close to the center but we didn't like it, we didn't spend the night, it seemed unsafe and not very quiet, there's a lot of space, they could set it up better, you park on the street next to the parking lot."
21515,2495200,2,Klaus1956,14/11/2022,"The place is partly paved, partly gravel. Generally a dusty affair. But, short walk to the center. Many restaurants were closed. Whether permanent could not be determined. Attention at the local and parking lot access."
21515,2490668,4,LosCano,11/11/2022,"We have spent one night here, quite noisy, but we must thank the city council for the initiative and think of us. Very close to the center to visit the town. Thank you!!!"
21515,2489485,5,Fagabanti,10/11/2022,Thank you Guadix for making this huge car park available to ccs for free! Possibility of emptying gray and black water and filling. Close to the center and the troglodyte houses. Obviously it's not luxury but the land is flat and safe and that's mainly what we're looking for :)
21515,2486119,3,paquito,07/11/2022,"Night of 24/10 calm, large parking lot very practical but location not great. We were lucky that it was quiet that night. However, there were a good dozen CCARs. We had gone to see the hospital car park which was deserted but the surroundings did not help us either. Besides, passing there the next morning it was full of cars!"
21515,2481776,4,danicuenca,04/11/2022,"Very wide and flat area. Asphalted part outside the enclosure, inside land. Water and emptying area. Very central just 5 minutes from downtown. They set up a market on the right bank of the river. You can park on the left side of the field at that time. Apparently quiet area, except for a bunch of young people with loud music and some skidding at night. There are no shadows. Yes, many campers."
21515,2475405,3,Manusalmar,31/10/2022,"The site is very spacious, and very central, but noisy. We spent one night."
21515,2464136,2,Diplo,26/10/2022,"Space is plentiful. The rock dwellings are over 5 km away. Unfortunately, right at the beginning a man came who yelled loudly and gesticulated. Since we didn't understand anything, he went away frustrated. The place is not guarded and we should have left our car there for at least 3 hours. We didn't feel comfortable and left Guadix immediately. What a pity!"
21515,2463523,3,Paula1Paul2,26/10/2022,"We went there on Saturday market day and got a seat. Very central and within walking distance to everything, including good shopping. There is also disposal. The place is quite noisy, which is why we drove on."
21515,2453653,4,DESCHIRON,20/10/2022,very large car park for all sizes only downside filling the water a bit laborious with the push button. the night was calm and the city and its super cave dwellings.
21515,2453155,5,BrisndsdeMendoza,20/10/2022,spectacular esplanade to leave the AC all services just 50 m from the cathedral. nearby taverns where you can have a snack.
21515,2448663,5,Correcorre,17/10/2022,"It is a very good place to park and spend the night. There is one day of the week (Friday night to Saturday noon, due to the market) that you cannot park, although you can trust water because it is outside the enclosure. There is no possibility to connect electricity."
21515,2445311,4,Marielcris02,15/10/2022,Easy access. unpaved esplanade. Calm and safe. On Saturdays there is a market on the esplanade but we were able to park without any problem.
21515,2444894,3,jean-claude65200,15/10/2022,"I confirm the previous comment plus the motorcycles .. on Friday evening 14/10, we went to sleep in Purrullena, 6km away, and we did well!!!"
21515,2439859,3,pticlod,12/10/2022,"convenient to visit and do the services. On the other hand today, October 12, a lot of noise, a lot of cars doing runs. we go further for the night."
21515,2419868,4,Bamboujos,03/10/2022,"Very good for spending a night and visiting the city, quite quiet"
21515,2290331,4,larosa,23/08/2022,We have spent one night because we had to stop. Behind there are parking lots and you can see that people come to spin their cars. It is very good to spend the night.
21515,2290116,5,DAM78,23/08/2022,"It is quite good, there are parking lots for motorhomes or campers, it is close to bars and shops. It has filling and emptying of water (free). There are plenty of seats. On Saturdays they put the market right behind."
21515,2249343,4,lucrimile,16/08/2022,"Convenient to empty and fill. SEWAGE is best emptied by lifting the lid off the ground, less mess."
21515,1992199,4,travel2022jt,19/06/2022,"Station was really fine for unloading. Place has hardly any shade to stand, but everything was there and everything worked :)"
21515,1907169,4,FamBurgers,22/05/2022,Good parking space close to the center of town. Only no shadow present
21515,1906479,3,frannetpat,22/05/2022,Perfect service. Near town and troglodytes. But very dusty parking lot.
21515,1902957,3,ArthurColson,20/05/2022,"Very close to the center of Guadix, convenient to visit. The services are in good condition but the tap is not practical. Lots of traffic at night"
21515,1900294,2,Segelhexe,19/05/2022,"All motorhomes park ON the dusty place, but the official pitches are IN FRONT of the place, on the street to the left and right of the VE, but it doesn't seem to be a problem. Free with supply, central therefore 2 stars. Otherwise not a nice place."
21515,1890129,3,jdpfund,14/05/2022,"Great location. Close to shops, restaurants and town centre. Please note that Saturday is market day. If you want to leave in the morning move on Friday evening. Because on Saturday you risk being blocked by vehicles. The market is worth a visit."
21515,1885260,3,madtrix,12/05/2022,"The parking space is just outside the enclosure, but when we arrived, everything and being prohibited, it was full of cars parked in the places for AC, so we parked inside just like all the AC that had arrived and I suppose they found the same thing. For me, clearer indications are lacking. The location is perfect to visit Guadix, but the site is very neglected."
21515,1857370,4,sofiahigashi,28/04/2022,"The site has water services, it is a bit abandoned, but it is close to the old town. We spent a quiet night, all right!"
21515,1854786,3,FeeeNdr,26/04/2022,"Good location for visiting the city, close to shops. The car park clearly lacks charm and the services are not very functional, in particular the water which does not flow hard enough. The young people of the city drive very fast in cars and on motocross, which creates a lot of noise pollution. It's not really a camping area, more like a public car park, but practical and safe."
21515,1848484,3,Ralphdomi,23/04/2022,"Street-side area with all services. But we settled in the huge parking lot with the other motorhomes and vans, at the bottom on the left because they were quieter. On the other hand, the young people of the city do car rodeos and put the music loud. But that didn't bother us. Thanks to the municipality"
21515,1836920,3,guslazin,19/04/2022,"It was a bit neglected, possibility of emptying and filling, it is located in the fairgrounds, close to everything to be able to take a walk without problems through this beautiful city. Thanks to the people for this initiative."
21515,1836782,4,Marcos12,19/04/2022,"It is true that the area is a bit neglected but to fill and empty water is more than enough. In addition, the parking is next door, the views are beautiful towards Sierra Nevada and Guadix is very beautiful."
21515,1818804,2,molamolax,13/04/2022,"The site works but it's in a sorry state: taps broken and hard to use, clogged drains, everything disgusting with shit floating,... and on top of that they've put on a fair so it's impossible to sleep with the noise"
21515,1818677,1,bencrafter,13/04/2022,Blocked waste… there’s massive turds looking at you whilst you fill up your water..
21515,1818409,2,cristina_831,13/04/2022,"the loading and unloading area succumbed, people throw the poty down the drain of the filling source and everything is clogged, the tap is to press and goes hard. The place to sleep is next to the fairs and, as is logical, they play loud music at least today until 12, but then the young people stay in the area in cars and with loud music. The very nice old town and the proximity of the parking lot."
21515,1806406,3,PhoenixCologne,04/04/2022,"In a huge, dusty, desolate parking lot, which is free after all. Used by the locals as an off-road track and shortcut. Ideal for visiting the city and partially good views of the cathedral."
21515,1801835,3,globulus,31/03/2022,free parking to visit the city. we did not use the services and did not sleep there
21515,1795216,5,WanderWebb,25/03/2022,Okay for visiting the town but essentially a large barren carpark. We had a quiet night here even though the Berlin Circus was in the carpark with us. A couple of boy racers did some rounds and a bike or two in the early evening but afterwards no bother. Police do patrol. Services are outside of parking area alongside the back road. Fabulous 9am bell ringing.
21515,1789141,5,Arpcec,20/03/2022,A very large area. Near the center.
21515,1786502,4,madeodz29,18/03/2022,Thanks to the municipality. quiet night but sounds of bells. we parked in the large parking lot behind the area. around twenty. guadix european troglodyte capital. remarkable site 1.55 euro for over 65s. interior of house to visit.
21515,1786162,4,CagouilleExpress,17/03/2022,At the moment there is a circus just behind. Water and drainage available. Not the most pleasant place but practical to visit the city because 10/15 minutes from the Cathedral and the tourist office on foot.
21515,1781174,1,1978Canto,12/03/2022,There is a 15 seats. We arrived at 5:00 p.m. and all busy. We parked at the end of the fairgrounds. Near the center. With services. Thanks to the council. We spent the night here because the children were sleeping... a bunch of young people until 1 in the morning with music and vehicles on (cold 4 degrees). At 4 in the morning cars skidding and racing. It has been horrible.
21515,1780581,5,itzi,12/03/2022,"That today a city council reserves places for motorhomes is to be appreciated. Many thanks to the municipality. Saturday market, perfect day to do good shopping."
21515,1778146,5,barou,09/03/2022,Lots of space in the parking lot which is not very good. Very calm in this season. Operational services. Thank you to the city for free.
21515,1773341,3,sciroco,04/03/2022,"It's not paradise, but parking and services possible so already not bad. The city is near."
21515,1772741,3,Störti01,04/03/2022,Have a quiet night spent. Man is just what more could you ask for. There isn't really anything to see in the city. Thanks to the city for this opportunity to stay overnight.
21515,1772022,1,Cruizer76,03/03/2022,Really ugly and run down area. Only to be used for V/E.
21515,1768374,2,worldvan2020,27/02/2022,"Completely ok for one night, V/E well located. City not really worth seeing, dirty, prostitutes in the parking lot, etc. Street is quiet at night, young people kept coming from SA to SO until 12:00 a.m. and after that it was quiet. For people without claims ok"
21515,1761624,5,bk55,20/02/2022,"We spent one night here. Is well located and close to the center. V/E would be very good if a Frenchman and then a Belgian hadn't emptied their faeces in the drinking water basin but in the floor drain provided in front of us. I didn't dare to even touch the water tap, because the camp colleague in question had completely sunk it in the chemical cassette."
21515,1761418,4,Frankia84400,20/02/2022,"Ideal for visiting this pretty town. The car park is huge and you can park where you want, except on Saturdays. The service area is a bit short for those over 7.50m. I would never understand why, while there is space in this large car park, some park in the very busy street glued to each other and facing the buildings opposite ??? Thanks to the community."
21515,1757745,4,dupi24,16/02/2022,"Large, practical, free, services (gray water emptying, black water, and water filling) free. Near the cathedral"

21515,1750138,4,jubelle31,07/02/2022,Night of 06/02/22. Simple but effective. Large parking lot in the city center so a little noise at night. But it's free and you can fill and drain water.
21515,1749985,1,Krambambuli,07/02/2022,ugly city parking lot
21515,1745915,4,jobeagal,02/02/2022,"Flat, free and close to the center with more drains and water. What more. Thank you Guadix."
21515,1745881,3,Agnes31,02/02/2022,Please note: no toilets on site. it's a shame because it's very big and close to the historic center. toilets available at the children's park crossing the river (they were out of service when we passed) or the bus terminal.
21515,1744980,4,Carlosvictor,31/01/2022,"A large car park with less electricity services, there is always a place, close to everything, Guadix a town with a lot of history to go through, touring."
21515,1742820,5,Boch51,28/01/2022,"Convenient flat parking with services. Few minutes walking from Guadix monuments.
Services are well maintained.
The toilet empty space is reachable by liftning the trap on the floor!
There is a great water pressure
Thank you Guadix!"

21515,1734575,5,Pretorianos,15/01/2022,"Night without noise despite being a weekend, one step away from the tourist train they take you to the cave houses where it stops for 45m free visit and then you continue on the train seeing the monumental route. Place and visit highly recommended by Praetorian Diving"
21515,1733296,4,typHAINE04,13/01/2022,"Very good for visiting the city and doing services, a bit noisy at night but good. Thank you city. And we are sure to have space with the large parking lot next to it"

21515,1728680,4,Vectragt,07/01/2022,"plenty of parking. As a recommendation, the filling and cleaning taps of Poti are backwards. in the cassette there is a thread which facilitates filling. a little more slope to empty the cassette would also be a recommended option."
21515,1727496,3,fifikiki,06/01/2022,Well placed drain. Free water for camper vans remember to leave behind your own pitch no security issues peaceful village
21515,1718986,2,Chcol89,29/12/2021,"Good for visiting the city, the cathedral and restaurants a stone's throw away but not for the night, plus a fun fair set up in the square just behind."
21515,1716541,3,Artur23,27/12/2021,We have slept well despite having a fair. Only bumper cars and playground.
21515,1708600,3,fmartinvtt,12/12/2021,Convenient for visiting the city and doing services (the day we visited the cleanliness was blah blah) We were passing through at the end of November and we did not sleep here. A cc who slept there told me that the night had been quiet but that doesn't make you want to
21515,1706491,1,vagabundavan,08/12/2021,"Impossible to be here while the fairground attractions are, it is unbearable, it is heard throughout the town, imagine in the area. Change of waters and for another place. A pity, the town is precise."
21515,1703087,3,abravo,04/12/2021,"Good site in terms of proximity to the center of Guadix and services. However, the floor is gravel and when we came there were attractions installed with a lot of noise at night. We stayed one night and the next day we left because the noise was excessive."
21515,1702921,2,Cochinota,04/12/2021,"Gravel site, accessible and very close to the center. The parking lot itself does not have pretty views but is well located for seeing the city. We spent one night and found it to be a noisy place. It has water, drained of gray and black water."
21515,1702544,3,Yeliso,03/12/2021,"It is an area that has approximately 15 car parks and with a very large park-like esplanade, it is in the center of Guadix. At this time there is a lot of noise because they have put some Christmas fair pots."
21515,1700517,5,Scilash66,30/11/2021,"Spent a silent night. I parked at one end of the large parking lot, further away from the noise of the street. And anyway Guadix is worth visiting and I thank the municipality for making the services available to us. Parking very close to the center to visit."
21515,1694204,1,LesPoipoines,20/11/2021,"Same as the previous comments. Saturday night is the meeting point for the neighborhood kékés (Los Kekes Del Barrio). Thank you Kevin, we all saw your golf 4 GTI lowered, no need to blow up the engine when you pass in front of the motorhome area. As for you Dylan, stop making donuts with your opel vectra from 1994 to wow Tiffany and don't forget to put your cans in the trash."
21515,1686676,1,Benetille2012,12/11/2021,"We took advantage of the site to empty the water and recharge it with drinking water. We had thought of spending the night there but the opinions of the place, the ill-famed atmosphere and the explosions of firecrackers from 7 p.m. convinced us to leave immediately. Too bad because it is difficult to be more central. We were able to find a much quieter place in the parking lot north of the referenced hospital as well."
21515,1679017,5,Yeye_trail,05/11/2021,"Quiet, spacious and central location with all services (filling, emptying waters)."
21515,1669785,3,Elenarg,30/10/2021,"Land motorhome area, well leveled. Very well located to see Guadix."
21515,1656063,4,cmlaura,21/10/2021,"We have spent the night of a Wednesday and we have slept peacefully, close to the center on foot. Very curious the neighborhood of the caves. The downside is that it is not clear where to empty the sewage. People throw them into the tap that has a thread. We have not taken water just in case. Otherwise all great."
21515,1652394,4,andreasliebe,19/10/2021,"Huge market square, in front of which around 15 spaces are reserved for mobile homes in addition to waste disposal. Most of them are free in the huge parking lot. There are also some shady spots under trees but without SAT reception. Disposal ok, a bit old. Saturday, Sunday market. Avoid these days. About 30 minutes on foot to cave dwellings, viewpoints, museum. Good to do."
21515,1610927,2,califoscolo,26/09/2021,"Reserved parking spaces in front of the public car park. Lots of car movement and music on the weekend. We stayed one night. Very convenient for visiting the country. Too bad for the inhabitants who urinated all night next to the water load and the campers. On Saturday mornings in one part they do the market in front of the campers so be careful if you have to go out, wake up early!"
21515,1583685,2,kursive,16/09/2021,"We have come to empty sewage and the experience has not been very pleasant. A well without a lid and flat (bad) with a hole of 15cm in diameter (very bad) with visible remains of other people's shit (there is a hose to clean everything!) It is a pretty shabby field, I would not sleep here."
21515,1572255,1,FISO08,12/09/2021,"I arrived on Saturday night of the 11 of the 9 of 2021, the music of the cars was very intense, the Civil Guard arrived and they lowered the music, after a while they made it even louder. After trying to sleep for a long time, around 3 in the morning I had to find a far away place to sleep. A pity that the good initiative of the City Council is spoiled."
21515,1569153,1,BielasyCadelas,11/09/2021,"We spent the night there a long time ago, on a Saturday night ... Horrible, all night with cars spinning, with the music at full blast, they left and came back again ... We didn't sleep the whole night. The next day there was a market, and the atmosphere that existed did not encourage us to leave the van parked there, so we left. I would not return for a joke."
21515,1560679,4,Chameana,08/09/2021,"We made a stop on Monday to empty and the truth is to be appreciated since not in all towns or cities you can find an area where emptying and filling is available and totally free, we came from Cabo de Gata and we paid € 5 just for emptying the black water. Ole by the town hall"
21515,1556710,3,oscpsa,07/09/2021,"The site itself is fine. We stayed on Saturday because we read that on Sunday there was an antique market and it was not like that. At night it is a bottle place and the cars park in the motorhome spaces even with a huge parking lot. It's okay to see Guadix, but we wouldn't split up to sleep"
21515,1509683,1,Lapepa19,25/08/2021,"It seems incredible to me, that with the large space and how beautiful or touristy the town is, they have not had the privilege or the pleasure and expense of investing in making a limited area for caravans and campers ..... even if it was paid , but it is unfortunate to see that crappy please mayor, are you not ashamed? there are smaller towns that have motorhome areas, learn! a little dignity"
21515,1507372,3,xanaclaudio,24/08/2021,Dumps and clean water. To stay overnight it's a bit deserted with no other ac.
21515,1499631,1,Mgalgo81,22/08/2021,For tastes colors. The place did not give us confidence and we left.
21515,1484807,4,Jbx87,20/08/2021,"Basic services, but very close to the cathedral and the city center, it's so rare. Noisy at night, the Spaniards sleep very little they like the coolness of the night but the place seems safe to me."
21515,1477002,4,Mariajors,18/08/2021,Very quiet and central to walk. It has shops close by and quiet to spend the night. recommendable.
21515,1401119,5,rodrigo,03/08/2021,"The works have already finished, well located near the center and with many places to visit: the cathedral, Roman theater, caves, historic center, town hall square ... I recommend the tapas of the restaurants and bars. attention, on Saturday mornings there is a market right next door."
21515,1379120,5,Retsetenodroc,29/07/2021,Free fill and empty service all correct
21515,1307942,4,Cordy,09/07/2021,There are roadworks at the roads leading to the big parking. But of course there is an access at the northern end. We even found a spot in the shade! Close to the cathedral.
21515,1278660,4,NomadasCharlatanes,26/06/2021,"A place to spend the night without problems, it is true that construction works next door but the area is free and perfect. No problem. Close to the city center to visit"

21515,1247519,4,malcon,10/06/2021,"It is not bad for one night, but it is true that there were places occupied by cars although there are the signs of only motorhomes, now the access roads are under construction so you have to look for the entrance and it seems to me that on weekends they sure do next bottle."
21515,1241890,3,amantares,07/06/2021,"It is a bit abandoned because they are undergoing construction, I suppose that when the works are finished and it is cleaned it will be fine, anyway thanks to Guadix for this area"
21515,1213962,4,Ele_y_jose,23/05/2021,"Good area, well located, fits an 8m ac. good access to catch water and empty. eye! to empty the sewage there is a hatch in the ground next to the tap. Do not throw the black in the taps! The area is not in an idyllic place, but it is worth it. Something noisy on Saturday night. It covers very well and cheap in the town. Free tapa with the drink. I recommend the Bogeguilla."
21515,1209739,2,MaiteJoan,21/05/2021,"There are no public toilets as such, it is a simple large municipal car park in the center of Guadix, there is only the fountain in the photo and the possibility of emptying water, we had been thinking that there were more services so it cannot be scored too well"
21515,1182378,1,jacrespos,30/04/2021,We arrived on Friday afternoon and we could not spend the night in the area since most of the places were occupied by parked cars

21515,1143531,5,Didj,27/02/2021,"Very good service area, clean, good water flow, gray water drain and WC. However a little complicated for those over 8 m (impossible to drain for them) As for sleeping there are other more suitable places. Thank you to the municipality for this free service."

21515,1138037,5,shauwert,16/02/2021,Apparently something has changed since the last reviews cause the place is clean and both water taps are working. You can empty the toilet in the lit and grey water on the green pavement. Really nice of the municipality to offer this for free.

21515,1134204,4,Thais249,31/01/2021,"The site is nothing to write home about but it allows you to visit the city. The water tap has been removed. Just behind the designated space there is a gigantic parking area in case you want to get away a bit. The city is beautiful, and the view of the Sierra in the snowy background gives it a very beautiful touch."

21515,861140,2,anaisma,11/07/2020,"To call it an area is to be very generous. It is a battery parking on land that borders a fenced enclosure where inside they put a market and others. As they comment to fill you can not .. It would be to empty gray or black and take a quick walk to town or stop for a while because it looks noisy at night, a shame they could improve it a bit."

21515,786188,4,aventurerfamily,25/02/2020,Very well. a lot of space and that's why some young people come here sometimes but without bothering us. Thank you to the city which offers us free services. muchas gracias
21515,782997,4,aneth01,19/02/2020,Sorry for those who criticize but good location FREE 5 minutes walk from the cathedral. In February no noise at night. Emptying services for gray and black water + water. 10/12 places but you can park in the car park next to it. Stayed 2 nights no problem.
21515,781898,3,JORDI2EURA,17/02/2020,"Area in a good place, very central and well located. The water intake is poorly designed and the taps do not have the classic thread. But you have to be grateful."

Friday and Saturday night the children of the town are dedicated to making noise and accelerations with their cars until late hours before going to the disco .. otherwise it is essential to visit the neighborhood of the caves .. Wonderful

21515,776359,3,christado,04/02/2020,I liked the central location of the square directly in the city. All sights are within walking distance. It was surprisingly quiet at night. During the day it was a bit louder due to the local traffic or parking space search. The following was particularly annoying during my visit (Monday and Tuesday): A resident locked his dog out on the balcony and the dog barked for hours.
21515,772178,4,davally,24/01/2020,Good serviced Aire close to centre. Great historical buildings and the cave dwellings at the top end of town are amazing. There was some noise from young people (Friday night) but not too late.
21515,767382,3,Devos,11/01/2020,"Good and very well located area. We arrived Friday morning, we visited the monumental city, Saturday is celebrated on the esplanade of the fair, street market. Many people but very quiet everything. Our applause to the City Council of Guadix."

21515,745008,3,kevnesta,19/11/2019,Good to park the day to visit the city. But to sleep there is really bad. In the bad neighborhood ...
21515,738651,1,Teresamila,05/11/2019,... Near the town and well ... But the truth is a shame the issue of water .. In the taps it was not possible to take water ... But my surprise is when a town builder has arrived with a bridle and started to fill .... Surely the City Council thinks that we do not carry the water ... Quite noisy at night ... Many people talking for an emergency if
21515,729114,1,LucianaCZ,24/10/2019,"We did not stay, only empty grey and black water. I would not drink the water as the ""container"" under the tap was full of shit. Someone probably emptied  black water there."
21515,728752,4,jjmarina,24/10/2019,we stopped the 12/10 and spent the night there (noisy) Perfect to visit the cathedral (in the morning) Nice little train to visit the troglodyte quarter A small stop anyway and free

21515,589529,1,AlberTitu,01/08/2019,"We spent one night there and thanks. We arrived late at dawn, and I could not look for anything better if I had not left. We were alone, and the feeling of insecurity was quite great. Cars entering and leaving the giant parking lot next door, spinning, with loud music, drinking and throwing bottles ... a mess come on. It gave me something even to leave the motorhome there half a day to visit Guadix, which is beautiful, but a pity that the motorhome area is like that. Even so, the city council is thanked for giving us these areas, but if I have to go back to Guadix I will not do it in this SAFE area. We could not fill the tap because there is no thread to plug hoses, and the gray and black area were as in works, I hope to improve the Area. I do not recommend it."
21515,536012,2,svo0094,02/07/2019,"The only reason for 2 stars is the free draining area containing everything except threads on the water tap. We tried to sleep there but didn't feel safe, and there were many people hanging around(monday), drinking, shouting. at 10pm, youngsters with cars came, started to play superloud disco and dance, than other car came and did the same, so we left. We were sorry we couldn't see the city."
21515,534433,4,franruiz,30/06/2019,It is appreciated that a people think of us and put a free area for campers. It may not be the best area but for a visit to the town or for a stop to rest and be able to drop gray and black is very good.

The good news is there is a separate area for filling drinking water, a hole in the FLOOR for black tanks and a grey Drain all free. We didn't stay. NB no thread on tap so bring correct adaptor for hose."

21515,467296,2,gon943,25/04/2019,"As a constructive criticism, to say that even if there are some super-wicked motorhome people (the ones that are least) the empty / filled / dirty / clean waste design is unhealthy, black should be made in the floor box, but there are people who empty it where it is not must, generating a lot of smell. As I said there is a poor design of the area and the same clears the Poti in any of the two taps. We will not return"
21515,462177,1,cuevi,21/04/2019,"Resurrection Sunday, I do not know if it was because of that, but there is a fair, apart from the Sunday rake. The idea was to eat and stay until Monday, but the emptying was impracticable of dirty and there was a mess of fear with the pots of the fair. We have eaten fast and we follow route. We will have caught a bad moment. A pity, we wanted to remember Guadix"

If you make him some shopping, he will almost kiss your hands. The only small restaurant (which is called El Perlas) does not abuse so far (we are not in France). Menu of the day very honest in relation quality price. More than a good nap?"
21515,411698,4,JeanmiPatou,03/12/2018,"Go to the Tourist Office, the lady who welcomes you is super nice and speaks besides Spanish, English, Italian and French. She is very involved with the town hall for the installation of this area and she is sorry to see in what state some camper put it by emptying their cassettes. If this continues the City Council plans to remove this area.We understood where to empty, the hatch is on the ground but not sufficiently indicated. So it's not just bad will of all users. We bought a red bomb and circled the cassettes emptying hatch on the ground. The city is nice, its traders also so do the maximum to respect them. Thank you."
21515,408801,2,marchachris,19/11/2018,"Possibility of draining gray / black water, it is necessary to raise the metallic hatch on the ground for the black water and not to pour its excrement in the fountain. To avoid the weekend noisy night, young people drink, music and vehicles running in the parking lot. Pity."
21515,395322,3,Raskantin,18/10/2018,"When I arrived there were four cars occupying SIX seats. The next day we were only three motorhomes, the rest of seats occupied by cars. Pity because the town deserves at least two days to enjoy it, but arriving and having to fight a place does not convince me."

The fairgrounds have occupied our parking lot and the gray water drain area: a useless arbor is installed on the site (see photo).

We filled our tank with our jerry can, no thread on the faucet. Emptying and discharging the toilet is no problem. Sometimes a car arrives from the local population. At least we had a quiet night. At the crossroads (300 m) there is an Intermarche with washing machines"

 I felt uneasy as we were the only van and it felt quite eerie there. Anyway we got some sleep until 5am when a car arrived, someone got out, then 5 minutes later got back in and drove off.  
Services working."

21563,3125211,2,Anythinggas,11/08/2023,"Fantastic views from campsite, cheap beer. Once again unfortunately ruined by locals in the campsite who are seemingly allowed to do what ever they want.  Everyone enjoying a peaceful evening and someone who seemed to have setup for the season starts playing a massive stereo. You would have hoped that the staff would have said something but they walked by. We were in a camper but people in tents."

It later turned out that six dogs were staying in a 'bungalow' that were taken care of by the owners. Thank you! They kept them away from our dog. However, we did not feel comfortable and that is one of the reasons why we left."

21563,1458118,1,GabiBergwerff,14/08/2021,"Not a warm welcome. Staff speak little or no English and we got the impression that the Portuguese were helped earlier and better. Food picked up from the restaurant, food was ok. It was very busy at the campsite. It seemed as if more people were being admitted than places were available. At 10:30 pm two more tents and a caravan were set up next to and behind us (this was accompanied by a lot of noise). Incidentally, this was not at a camping spot but just on the street. Many dogs on the campsite, which also bark at night. Views over the water were lovely, shame this was ruined by the cars and caravans very close to us. Sanitary was somewhat outdated and dirty, but sufficient showers and toilets available. The campsite did not seem aimed at people from outside but mainly focused on the local guests."
21563,1297050,5,daniel3005,04/07/2021,"Pleasant place in the middle of nature where there are no pre-booked places for motorhomes, the staff is very friendly and invited us to take a walk around the park and choose any of the available places. It has access to the dam. It has a restaurant with wifi, the mobile network signal is quite weak."

Rent a canoe, boat trip to Dornes, rent a bike, swim in the lake. We recommend. Dornes is one of the 7 most beautiful villages in Portugal."
21563,944206,2,guisanteverde,09/08/2020,"It is located in a good place, near the river and from the plots you can see the water between the trees. When we arrived there was only one free plot left and there were lots of young people in tents. The pool is empty and the reception is a disaster ... There are only a few bathrooms for the whole campsite and only 4 showers for women and 3 for men. For how small the campsite is, it was super busy ..."

21563,95983,1,pdolivet,16/08/2016,Really very disappointed with this campsite at the reception already not very engaging. The few places for motorhomes are concrete slabs. For the first time we had the impression of disturbing the Portuguese between them. We had to move the vehicle despite the instructions of the reception! We paid 26 € for 1 night to 3 adults and 2 children. Go your way!

21585,455259,3,willvy,15/04/2019,First of all it has to be said that this area is what the kids use in the afternoon to meet and be making noise with their motorcycles until about eleven o'clock at night. Then the area remains with a certain tranquility to be able to spend the night without any news. The natives are a little unpleasant but the city is visitable.

21598,463865,3,delfsupertramp,22/04/2019,"Convenient to visit the city, it climbs but it's going, not sleep here, surely noisy. It's better at the lake at the bottom"
21598,458783,1,tasfex,19/04/2019,"First day for the festivities of Holy Week IMPOSSIBLE to sleep in this car park, tremendous concentration of young people making bottles. On holidays nothing advisable."

21598,385096,3,grangurug,30/09/2018,Wide parking. 15 minutes walk from the center. We could not park because it was occupied by the stands of the fair that were that week. Finally we parked in a hole that was free on the main street.
21598,234528,4,ratatouille37,08/04/2018,"Ideal for visiting the old town. 1.5 km of climbing, but it's worth it. Anyway, it is impossible to drive with a large vehicle, and very difficult to park there even with a cart."
21598,223777,1,Blubbs84,20/02/2018,Wrong coordinates! Navigation leads incorrectly to the city center. The other place is better to reach and quiet.

21598,55994,1,eeae,25/09/2015,We have just been and we have not been able to park since the land is occupied by the fair attractions. Another Spanish population without an area for motorhomes. I am very sorry the number of towns that we have not been able to visit due to the lack of parking. The City Councils do not realize the income they lose when they let motor-caravan tourism escape.
