13871,3286946,5,LaPrimastar,12/09/2023,"Thanks to the Jaca city council, everything works correctly; gray, black water emptying, water filling. Quiet place to sleep and get to know Jaca. A few minutes from the old town and being able to visit the Ciutadela (dogs are allowed), the cathedral, the Clock Tower... all highly recommended and where you can eat super delicious"
13871,3252210,5,barbara71,03/09/2023,"Everything in working order for dumping  and filling up with drinking water. 10min walking distance to old town.
We had to show the police the official homologation papers of our converted van. So only official motorhomes can stay on this parking, others risk a fine. The police also fined motorhomes parked on the space reserved for buses. Parking alongside the parking seems to be ok."
13871,3249577,5,MC1960,02/09/2023,"Great spot at the foot of the city. Very calm. Gray and black water service. On the other hand, only around twenty places, at this time at noon it is full. free area. I recommend."

13871,3240219,3,Elliot.MAA,30/08/2023,"Thanks to the City Council for leaving a little area for motorhomes, but it has become very small. It is also shared with buses. We parked outside and in luxury. The best very close to Casco Historia. I recommend it. BEAUTIFUL city with a lot of life. Opinion of some Sevillians."
13871,3237439,5,Pili8,30/08/2023,"They don't fine!! We have been there for 2 days and I have a 5.90m camper and the local police passed by, they didn't say anything or fine.

13871,3228016,5,Yerar14,27/08/2023,"Perfect area. All services free, well leveled and with some shade. You couldn't ask for more. The center of Jaca is less than a 5' walk away. Thanks to the town hall for this wonderful site. Quiet night. Only AC, no campers (They fined with reason), it already says that only AC and buses."
13871,3208830,2,pandasoniq,24/08/2023,I couldn't get in because there was no room. They didn't fine me for spending the night parked next door but now (it's almost 9 o'clock) I see that the cops fine a motorhome inside... I have no idea why...
13871,3203211,4,RUMOJOIA,23/08/2023,"Despite being very popular, it is located practically in the center of the city and is quiet at night."
13871,3160589,4,esbeast110,16/08/2023,Easy to find but very busy.  Sufficient shade and close to town.  Relatively quiet at night.  Enough space to manoeuvre and park 9m tag axle.
13871,3145460,5,lulubaroudeuse,14/08/2023,"parking well located, close to the city center. do not park in bus lanes, police issue fines."

13871,3141606,5,aguere,14/08/2023,"Thanks to the town hall for giving us this area. All perfect water and discharge of gray and black water. Do not park in the BUS area, the municipal police fine."
13871,3137879,4,Rondalla,13/08/2023,area very well located 5 minutes from the center

13871,3131759,4,JorgeDuarte,12/08/2023,"Wing for 23 seats, but if it had twice as many it would be full at this time of year, every 5 minutes an AC arrives. Shared with an area for Buses and the police fine those who are on the Bus. Behind the Municipal swimming pool there is a Park with more places and more peaceful than this Wing, it just doesn't have services. Next to the Asa, there are stairs that will give access to the old part of the city."
13871,3129339,1,Tnike,12/08/2023,"Impossible to park, we continue on the road, Insufficient area for the town, as they say in other comments, some live permanently or for long periods, this is solved by setting a stay limit and a small cost that would surely come in handy for the town's coffers."
13871,3121565,3,anatife,11/08/2023,"In fact, everything is complete. The solution is for many to position themselves on bus locations, at their own risk. I preferred to reach the area of El Pueblo de Sabinanigo, 15 km away. So much for Jaca's visit."
13871,3112159,5,anafl,10/08/2023,Central area with all services. Thanks to Jack.
13871,3110472,3,anelu,09/08/2023,"Car park with all the services free and quite big but it is very busy and it is difficult to find a place, even after waiting for an hour. We went to the next town because the Jaca city council prohibits parking motorhomes in the entire municipality except in authorized areas."
13871,3085739,4,anhuri,06/08/2023,"It's good because you have to empty and refill water for free, the bad thing is that there are fixed motorhomes there and there are few places. For that it would be better if it was paid or controlled to avoid these abuses. If you park on the left (bus zone) you are next to a road that is quite busy at the end and beginning of the day."
13871,3078016,4,motocamper57,04/08/2023,"ok but only 24 seats. IMPORTANT: do not park where it says BUS, today the police came and fined"
13871,3072890,3,FrankHollywood,04/08/2023,"Beautiful city worth seeing. The city can be reached on foot in 10 minutes. Unfortunately, as described by other campers, it is difficult to get a place. We arrived in the evening and got a place in the morning. We could see the hustle and bustle with the police and the wrong campers all day long. There are many permanent campers here, pay attention to the rust on the brake discs."

13871,3050693,5,marinoski,31/07/2023,"Yesterday when we arrived it was already full. After going around several times we went to the campsite and the girl told us that the town hall had set up a new area on the outskirts of Carrefour (towards France). It is signposted, the area is a quiet street. It has to empty and fill water. And the overnight stay is allowed from 10:00 p.m. to 10:00 a.m."
13871,3042899,4,AleyAna,29/07/2023,Paved parking near the center of town. Free loading and unloading of gray and black. It is noted that the town is committed to this tourism. The only drawback is that there are few places for the number of visits it has and it is difficult to get a place.
13871,3040764,4,ojumaremia,29/07/2023,"Today full without places,"
13871,3025882,4,Nelma,26/07/2023,"Thanks to the Jaca City Council for making and maintaining this area, today it is well cared for and everything works, there are only tenants who live permanently and several vans that occupy space."
13871,3019925,3,Krissa33,25/07/2023,"Too bad, I arrived at 2:30 p.m. and everything was full. I stopped just to eat at a bus slot, and after 5 minutes the police came and asked me nicely to leave, but they still allowed me to finish my meal."
13871,3012933,4,anfravi,24/07/2023,"good area for motorhomes, not for campers"
13871,2985039,1,JorgeyLaura,18/07/2023,"If you are a Camper and you have your vehicle as a tourism and not as a van, do not stop because they will fine you. According to what they told us when we went to pay the fine of €40... you can outside and use the water but not park inside..."
13871,2935769,1,lecar,08/07/2023,"Good to make an overnight stay, but if you are too late in the day there is no place and if you are too early the shops are not open until 5 pm, restaurants open at 8 pm"
13871,2915867,1,aranxa16,02/07/2023,"For a city like Jaca, having only this area is a shame, a city full of signs indicating that overnight stays are prohibited in the entire city outside of the authorized areas, since there is only this area and it is always full. To get a seat you have to arrive early."
13871,2907639,1,viosites,30/06/2023,"It's a shame that the town hall still doesn't listen to us. There are users who use the area as private parking. Apart from those who live permanently or for long periods of time. It's a shame that due to a few selfish people and the carelessness of the town hall we can't visit the city. They should regulate stay, so that we all have a chance."
13871,2883657,5,JORDI2EURA,23/06/2023,"A good area, in a central location. There are always intolerant people who, if the tap is broken the day they pass by, make it known. These are problems that will be solved quickly and there is no need to say anything. The area is good and you just have to see that it is always full. A 10 at the town hall."
13871,2862254,4,Greygappers,17/06/2023,"A very convenient free Aire in the very pretty town of Jaca. It is shared with a coach parking area and these start up at around 7.00 am.

There is fresh water and waste disposal on site. It does fill quickly so get there early. There is another Aire in Jaca 2.5km out of town."
13871,2837547,4,Vilamajor1980,09/06/2023,"Good area to visit Jaca. At 6 in the afternoon we took the last square, being a weekday. There are ACs parked in the area without staying overnight. We did not use the services. It would be nice if there was a time limit for overnight stays. We spent a very quiet night there. Thanks to the city council."
13871,2833832,3,JuanPedroMunozAntolinos,08/06/2023,"the area itself as described would be a 10 if not forced to leave. We call tourism and even if there are no signs you cannot stay overnight, they denounce. Going up through the same area you have the center of Jaca at 400m. perfect location"
13871,2832940,5,bertiebuggie,08/06/2023,Good Aire with full services including fresh water. Level and shaded. Very popular place which was full by late afternoon even mid week. The old town is a short walk and worth a visit especially the cathedral and the fort. We stayed two nights.
13871,2806379,3,CattinJ,31/05/2023,"Thank you to Jaca for providing space to park/sleep close to the town. 
It's a busy space which won't win any awards for being picturesque but it's flat, has shade and some services (we only used grey water).
We got a slot fine and there were spaces available until the evening.
Locals use it as a cut through so quite a lot of people walking past.
Jaca was OK..not sure I'd return unless passing."
13871,2791498,4,fourat66,27/05/2023,Certainly the area is quickly full (20 places) but a big thank you to the municipality for having made it. 5 minutes from the city center and good tapas bars. Namely morning awakening by buses because bus station next door.
13871,2790265,2,LaLola_en_ruta,27/05/2023,Still without water. There are free places.
13871,2785356,1,asv84,25/05/2023,"Overrated. Every year worse. More and more full. A branch recently fell on an AC, causing damage. The drinking water tap is still not working. Small area and next to the bus parking that sometimes starts at 6/7 am. Discrimination towards motorhome drivers by the Ayto de Jaca is increasingly noticeable, based on municipal ordinances that are a joke"
13871,2780108,4,txotxeytxoneta,23/05/2023,"an area with services very close to the center of Jaca, there is a lack of space, many ACs left because there was no room left in a tourist place like Jaca, the town hall fined them for parking outside the area, which seems discriminatory to me, so it is more of a great site."
13871,2779820,5,Bedine,23/05/2023,This car park is really well located for a visit to Jaca and for hiking around. Very near the historic center. The Clean water faucet is broken. That of the black water drain works. The only downside at this time of year is the poplar moss and tree sap. It's a big problem. To privilege the side which is not under the trees.
13871,2776672,3,laspescadillasviajeras,22/05/2023,"A Monday and it was full. The dump area was a bit dirty from tree debris. The clean water faucet is broken, the handle is missing. In our case, when the parking lot is full, we continue en route. Even so, it is appreciated that you keep us in mind."
13871,2775328,3,DavidRadua,22/05/2023,Lots of pollen! The faucet to refill water was broken! Pretty quiet to be in the middle of a town.
13871,2772317,2,Lidia3991,21/05/2023,"It was full at 7 pm, there was not a single place left. The council should expand this service and add more places. They lose tourism!!"
13871,2753923,4,dragonqueen,16/05/2023,"We came on a Monday at 10am and there was plenty of vacancy. In the evening the place was full. The police checked. Super place with everything except electricity. Thank you to the community. Close to the center, it is worth strolling through the streets of the old town. The only downside is the many silver poplars. The seeds came down thick as snow."
13871,2747391,1,osocaravanero,13/05/2023,No parking throughout the city. Parking allowed ONLY 12 spaces that were obviously full. We called the Police to avoid a fine and they sent us to a Poligono in the outskirts. We had the idea of spending the day shopping and eating but we went to another place where they even want us to stop to visit them. A pity but we will not return.
13871,2745532,5,distritocamper,13/05/2023,Excellent motorhome area. During the day it is empty but in the afternoon - night it is usually full and you cannot park outside the marked area because if you do not you will be fined. It has a dog park nearby and is a 10 minute walk from town.
13871,2740316,1,lllrrrlll,10/05/2023,"Area always full. On 5-10-23, the Jaca City Council has been confirmed as City Council, being able to penalize if you park outside this place. I suggest you look for another destination."
13871,2736154,5,Picolo47,09/05/2023,Great area not far from old Jaca and the citadel. Be careful though a poplar branch fell on a cc this week in the middle of the night. See if the municipality will do the maintenance. Prioritize the other side. We were there at that time and it really sucks. You still need to have space because it is a very popular area.
13871,2732772,3,iftjourney,08/05/2023,A very popular/busy spot as parking for motorhomes within the city is prohibited outside the designated area. Services available. Arrive early to get a space we came through several times the previous day with no available space spent the night just outside Jaca and returned early the following morning and managed to get a place.
13871,2728023,4,giri57,06/05/2023,Parking was full so we moved on.  It’s a shame
13871,2704712,4,Truusknotjes,28/04/2023,"practical place. there is power on the left, not on the right. come early and have some patience because the waiting is for a departing camper. don't park anywhere else! fine is very high. There is checking. fact when we were there, at least 70 campers entered the site in vain. we were lucky at 3 p.m. someone just left. Jaca is a small cute tourist village. ski and pelegrinos"
13871,2677374,3,anja4967,17/04/2023,The place was full by noon. The buses (bus station next door) leave early in the morning. Very centrally located.
13871,2664641,4,leyenda67,12/04/2023,"Very good somewhat small area, with all services, the worst in the movement of buses in the morning since the parking lot is next to the area. Thanks to the Jaca town hall for this area."
13871,2660128,2,oriolrue,10/04/2023,"eye!!!!! If there is no space, you cannot park anywhere else in the town. After calling the local police, they told me that I could park outside the area, in front of the bus area, it is a battery car park and only if you do not even occupy a sidewalk no road!!!!!"
13871,2649902,4,AntonioRubioII,08/04/2023,We were one day. The area is neither one of the most comfortable nor one of the best places to rest. I give it 4 stars for the location which is ideal. You have to arrive from 10 to 12 to ensure a place. the parking behind is only for buses and the police warn that they fine. Although yesterday there were a few and they escaped (at least when we left).
13871,2648491,1,MonisFamily,08/04/2023,"Jaca doesn't like us, the only central area to visit, after 2 failed attempts and many many laps around the city, we stopped in the surroundings of this parking lot (always full) just to eat and FINE. The policeman was on the lookout, which he was right, because we invaded the road. I didn't even notice the sidewalk, I was guided by the rest of the parked ACs and of course, all fined, so BEWARE"
13871,2647266,1,Silvisol,07/04/2023,"Not recommended They fine you if you stop in a parking lot, a full area, we don't even stop, it is not worth visiting Jaca in exchange for a fine…."
13871,2643371,5,zurix,06/04/2023,There are 24-25 spaces next to the old town. Good facilities and quiet overnight.
13871,2637042,5,mbarat,03/04/2023,"Very practical for visiting Jaca, next to the historic center and with free services. Dog park next door and playground under construction. We arrived at night and we had to park in the surroundings because it was full, but without problems, quiet night."
13871,2635726,4,mymyl,02/04/2023,"Air without much interest because located in the parking lot with the Buses and in the middle of town. All the time, free services and miraculously relatively calm during my visit."
13871,2632639,5,JordiDS,31/03/2023,"Quiet area for motorhomes, campers and buses. It gets very crowded at night. It has an area for emptying water and for filling. For those who go with a dog there is a huge grass field right next to it, perfect for them. All free."
13871,2629137,4,VanArJo,29/03/2023,Very practical to go up (some stairs) to the old town. Thanks Jaca!
13871,2627421,4,Travelaar,27/03/2023,"Nice place to visit the city. It fills up quickly and it is impossible to sleep in due to large buses that start and depart in the morning, but a quiet night."
13871,2626057,3,LaNaveDeHuevin,27/03/2023,"Free water and emptying. The bad thing is attached to the bus parking lot and from the first hour they start to move, and many spend a long time with the engine running, that's the bad thing."
13871,2625777,4,Wildthings,26/03/2023,Handy Aire for using Somport and Jaca is worth a wander. Barrier up when we visited in March. All services less EHU and rubbish disposal adjacent to the site. It was full by 3 PM when we visited (a weekend) and a dozen or so vans parked adjacent in or just outised the coach park alongside.
13871,2618121,5,LandiLuna,21/03/2023,"Perfect stop for MHs. A couple of campers are also here. Close to the old town. Don’t leave it too late to get here though as it does fill up. Didn’t notice many ‘permanent’ residents, mostly people travelling through, like us. Thank you to the municipality for providing this area and the free services"
13871,2615852,1,kaxau,19/03/2023,Do not think about spending the night in it if you are a camper!!!! You get a fine. The municipality of Jaca details it on its website. Although normally you won't be able to because it's always full
13871,2614336,1,jac79,18/03/2023,area to forget for the night. It is occupied by local CCs who are stationed there year-round for more than 50% of the places!!! Do not hesitate to go to the other free area with plenty of space (50) where we spent 2 quiet nights. The police are making rounds!
13871,2607671,5,ando90mg,12/03/2023,"Area with all services, 5 minutes walk from the old town of Jaca. If you arrive after 5:00 p.m., it is impossible to find a place. Good experience, in case we return to Jaca, we will repeat for sure."
13871,2594174,3,mymyl,28/02/2023,"Let's say OK for tonight but frankly.. I don't see what's good here, apart from the services which are free. We are at the foot of the buildings and in the same car park as the buses.. It promises for tomorrow morning!"
13871,2587971,3,Jother,23/02/2023,"Some inclination, otherwise all correct. In the morning the noise of the buses bother the least early risers. PS: Jaca's municipal regulations prohibit AC and vans from spending the night in the city (even if they are small). We understand that 24 seats is a scarce number to deal with the tourism that the city receives. We do not intend to disturb, in fact we have shared a space with 2 vans"
13871,2584043,4,karpets,20/02/2023,"Difficult to park depending on arrival time, in addition to small vans (California) occupying motorhome spaces. Good location, close to the center but a bit noisy. It also has some tilt."
13871,2574702,4,LoPinyol,11/02/2023,We have been very lucky to be able to park. I find it difficult to find a place here on the weekend. The location is very good.
13871,2555591,5,Nomadas80,19/01/2023,very well equipped and clean
13871,2550139,4,GeloCamper2023,12/01/2023,"Almost full on January 11, 2023, many buses in the adjoining part, after dinner it was completely full. Finally in a tourist car park on Calle Burnao next to the Citadel of Jaca where you will sleep very quietly and without noise."
13871,2549544,4,zearotzabeitia,11/01/2023,"The area is very well located, close to the center, but it was full. We spent two nights in the surrounding car parks, which were also full, without any problems."
13871,2546497,5,hekla60,08/01/2023,"Very close to the center and with free grey, black and clean water services. It is almost always full, the area remains small, but thanks to the town hall for having enabled it."
13871,2541966,5,MarcGallego,05/01/2023,"We had a great night, it was full. But we were able to park outside. Best of all, it is next to the center. A very lively town. Thanks to the city council of Jaca."
13871,2529267,3,arconadag,27/12/2022,Near the center of Jaca. Almost 100% occupied
13871,2524939,2,outtotravel,20/12/2022,Location is at a bus depot. The first one left around 6.30 am and before leaving they let the engine warm up for half an hour.
13871,2521142,5,siomikas,13/12/2022,"Nice aire and very cozy and beautiful town to visit. Calm night. Yes it is always overcrowded since a lot of motorhomes comes from surrounding towns and mountains to spend the night. In the morning and during the day we found the place twice at this time and in the evening it is not possible to find a spot and really don’t park in the bus places, because you will be fined and forced to leave."
13871,2519216,1,TxikiRo,11/12/2022,"Impossible to spend the night unless you station in the morning. There is even an abandoned vehicle occupying a space. Be careful with parking in the bus zone or outside invading the sidewalk, as they fine without prior notice. Although it is far away, it is better to spend the night in Carrefour. Honestly, it is not a city to visit by motorhome because there are not enough parking spaces. Perfect for emptying and filling."
13871,2518441,4,Inmabaut,10/12/2022,"We have been one night, we arrived at dawn and all the places were full. Finally we parked around with a camper, there were more campers. Local police hanging around at night. quiet night, the location is great, super close to the center. They did not give us any fine. Recommendable."
13871,2516552,5,RaulSJ,08/12/2022,"Area in the heart of Jaca with all free services, and level squares."
13871,2516122,2,Benatgar,08/12/2022,"The area is good since it is close to the center. The only thing that fills up very easily... the town hall managing the motorhome parking lot is very bad, applying regulations without a legal basis, people park in the bus parking lot but I don't recommend it since they get fined..."
13871,2513249,5,raul1996,05/12/2022,"a 10 for Jaca, near the center and with services"
13871,2508247,5,pelorojo,28/11/2022,"Quiet area, close to the center. Friday at 8:00 p.m. there was no room."
13871,2507935,4,malonu88,28/11/2022,"Very well located near the center, free and highly requested."
13871,2507032,4,pierrepp,27/11/2022,"everything is free but there is no possibility of having electricity. shame. for the rest, I confirm the positive comments already made."
13871,2503445,4,RutCM,23/11/2022,"A very good area to visit the city with good services, except for the water tap that had a special thread and we had to ask some colleagues for help since of all the nozzles we had, none of them worked well. It was full to sleep upon arrival, and we had to go to the other area that they enable. Jaca doesn't like us, they prohibit parking in the whole town."
13871,2497550,5,AnnDeWyspelaere,16/11/2022,"A free place, barel was open. Close to the old town and tourist office, you can get there quickly via the stairs. Water free and empty possibilities. The fortress, just outside the old town, is worth a walk around."
13871,2485795,5,Mrduppy,06/11/2022,"We were glad of this Aire on a stormy night. The old town is very interesting, with its narrow streets and ancient buildings. Thank you to the town for making the space for so many Motor homes. Every space was taken last Thursday night. Easy to find and get in and out of. Well positioned service point too."
13871,2476991,4,familiapardell.miret,01/11/2022,"Very well located area, near the center and with all services"
13871,2467827,5,AdriR1,28/10/2022,"Good location, a few meters from the main street. There are few places, as you come at night you won't get a place. Now on the night of 10/28 the police have come to evict those who are occupying the bus seats (it is shared parking). Behind there is a quite large Pipican for our puppies."
13871,2466581,4,Adrian1507,28/10/2022,"We slept on 10/22. It has a perfect location. Walking in 5' you are in the main street. You have to fill the water and empty gray and black water. The seats are large, you can get tables, chairs and whatever you want. The only drawback is that it is very small..."
13871,2456177,5,pamuxa,22/10/2022,Good area with all emptying and filling services. 24 seats. Always quite full. Near the center.
13871,2441877,5,ourvanhelsing,13/10/2022,"So many thanks to the Ayuntamiento of Jaca for putting on this site. All the necessary facilities, and a beautiful old town.  We turned up just after 11 in the morning and at least 8 spaces were free. By mid-afternoon, nothing."
13871,2437421,5,campervancastaways,11/10/2022,"Lovely town a few minutes walk from the Aire. Very popular place, we had to wait for a place and moved on in the end but returned and got lucky. Free but there has been a barrier, so maybe not always free? Dump/fresh, spacious marked bays on tarmac. Jaca old town is full of life!"
13871,2430816,5,barou,08/10/2022,Perfect. All the services are working and the area is pleasant even if we didn't sleep there. Very nice setting surrounded by mountains. Don't hesitate...and have a good trip.
13871,2429176,1,tiberberti,07/10/2022,"Impossible to park area, always full. It is only possible to spend the night in this area and in another that they have located on the outskirts. You can't park anywhere in Jaca either, except in the Llano de la Victoria car park. Fine anywhere else. We left Jaca without leaving a penny in the shops."
13871,2421070,2,Jolube,03/10/2022,"The faucet for black water is poorly designed, you have to juggle to be able to clean the Poti. There are not many places and on top of that the new municipal ordinance prevents sleeping in the rest of Jaca, except in the Carrefour car park which is very far away, very badly, it makes no sense to mistreat ACs like that."
13871,2404946,4,kdp10,26/09/2022,"Excellent location and easy entry. It’s busy we arrived midday Monday in late September and only a couple of places which were soon taken. Jaca is a great place to visit plenty of bars, restaurants with a good vibe even on a Monday."
13871,2403502,1,Nacho53,25/09/2022,"Area always full of motorhomes, outside if you park they denounce and in the other daytime alternatives they let you park at one end of the city but you can't park at night and at the other end they leave at night but at 10 in the morning You have to leave the area, otherwise report. They are managing the influx of motorhomes very badly."
13871,2402952,1,lllrrrlll,25/09/2022,"Area always full, even on weekdays out of season. and the City Council fines if parked in the town. Apparently they don't want us! I will spend my money elsewhere."
13871,2402672,1,paifuu,25/09/2022,There are more motorhomes than the area closest to the city can support. The mayor does not want more than 40 motorhomes or so and on top of that he seeks to fine all those that are improperly parked. You have to arrive early to get a seat or you'd better go to the farthest (which did not convince us at all although we saw it). In the end we went to Biescas and it was a great success in every way.
13871,2400708,1,Minmosin84,24/09/2022,A shame to go to Jaca to meet and enjoy it and find that we are poorly received. Small crowded area and nowhere to stay overnight without risk of being fined. The other area indicated is on the outskirts and is a truck parking lot. Finally we spend the night in Biescas where we have been much better received.
13871,2382940,4,sheila280885,18/09/2022,full area. Be careful not to park where the buses are. The police come and give a fine. We asked them and they sent us to spend the night in the Victory Flat Day area. Entrance by José Luis serrá street.
13871,2372772,4,llromeu,15/09/2022,Ideal for visiting Jaca. Very crowded and noisy in the morning. Correct services.
13871,2364862,3,angelitobomber,12/09/2022,"the area is really fine, but we couldn't stop at full speed, it is seen that people are leveraging there, it should be more controlled since it is impossible to park in Jaca without the risk of a complaint and the other area is windy... stopping to rest is fine but visiting the city is far"
13871,2364398,3,hanslily,12/09/2022,Busy motorhome. Free. Clean and waste water facilities. Near the center of the pleasant town of Jaca.
13871,2355990,4,AidaLN,09/09/2022,"Chapó, free services for emptying, gray water and clean water. Parking is fine, with level ground. Most are motorhomes and after eight in the evening, it is difficult to park, there are very few spaces, 20 approx."
13871,2354553,1,3260bnm,09/09/2022,Beware the van without being approved as a home. The municipal police told me that I had to leave. They did not fine me but it was not long
13871,2352971,5,McHeck,08/09/2022,Shady and good vibes among the campers.
13871,2347084,5,Aljuinan01,07/09/2022,We have spent a night in this area totally calm. Recommendable. There was enough room. 5 min walk from the center of Jaca. Totally recommended.
13871,2346896,1,jf11,06/09/2022,The city must not like tourists and even less motorhomes!
13871,2345578,3,socrate09,06/09/2022,"free area, would be great because close to the city center but the buses right next to it run their engines in the am for the air conditioning for well over an hour so we breathe their gas and we experience the noise at the same time great for the city environment !!! AC suction cups in addition that take places of tourism AC"
13871,2297598,3,RobertoDomingo,25/08/2022,"Simply extraordinary. Please, let's not abuse these initiatives (tables and chairs outside, dirt...) so they don't get removed. Thanks to the Ayto de Jaca"
13871,2292838,4,Triangulo,24/08/2022,"Parking very well located, but with few spaces, about 24. In the bus section if you park and you are not inside you will be fined, and they will not let you use those bus seats to pectorate. If you wait it may be that someone leaves."
13871,2289684,1,Maldivas,23/08/2022,"It doesn't surprise me that the areas limit us, with how uncivil we are, people who get out of the motorhome and the first thing they do is pee in the parking lot, everything is full of papers and garbage remains and this is ours, because it is our parking , so they send us to the outskirts to spend the night and with good reason!"
13871,2276901,1,Laiko,21/08/2022,Jack is a disgrace. This car park is super small and at night it is forbidden to spend the night in the city. Hundreds of AC moving at night not knowing where to stop. i will never come back
13871,2267925,1,estherrivas,19/08/2022,"If you are parked correctly they cannot fine you, it is illegal. The traffic law does not discriminate between motorhomes and cars in terms of parking, therefore it is illegal. We should always resort and end these abuses of power"
13871,2264475,3,matthis95,18/08/2022,"Full parking lot, the police check and report the camper vans that park in the bus places, we slept in the car park at the crossroads"
13871,2264052,3,amilpin080,18/08/2022,"Full, I couldn't park. At least filling and emptying is free. I have parked next to the Mercadona, but only during the day. At night the police have sent us to the other area of Carrefour. You can only park and spend the night in the authorized places. FINED FAST if you don't park where the police say. A well parked Camper next to the area (in the lines) is fined €80 right now."
13871,2262769,1,GloriaSunlight,18/08/2022,"Attention: we have just been fined for parking, not camping, outside the ac area (because it was full). We are going with a camper and we have parked in battery, within the lines. The camper was parked correctly. We have gone to the center to eat and on the way back we already had the fine. Obviously we will make an appeal because, as a vehicle, we pay taxes and we have the same right to park as a car"
13871,2262330,1,ionidoia,18/08/2022,"We have been fined a camper and a motorhome. It has been impossible to park the area because it was full, with motorhomes outside, we have gone behind the ice rink, PARKED not CAMPED, inside the stripes and they have given us 80 euros each Since we have out to the fine 20 minutes have passed. They are going to catch, they have no signs other than at the entrances to Jaca, inside the town you will not see any."
13871,2250370,3,Francoluiagm,16/08/2022,It would be nice if they regulated it. There are people who have not moved for days and the gaps are minimal if you are lucky enough to be there at the right time. if you park outside or where the buses you get fined
13871,2247624,2,JavierAlc,16/08/2022,Good place to spend the night 5 minutes from the old town going up some stairs that are just behind the park. The problem has been that the services for emptying water and filling were not enabled.
13871,2247298,1,doesnacamper,16/08/2022,"What a pity that a city council like Jaca denounces the motorhomes that are parked outside the areas. yes, I said parked. I have seen the local police going around the town looking for motorhomes to report. How sad and how pitiful on the part of the authorities. We look like criminals. I will not stop in Jaca again to spend my money. they just want flip flop tourism"
13871,2247181,1,Rosi86,16/08/2022,"They fined us with a Camper, with a raised roof etc... because when looking at the license plate it was registered as tourism. Be careful because they are searched and they will look for the fine."
13871,2239582,5,aitorniyo,15/08/2022,"an ideal place to park, free with limited spaces, don't even think about parking in the place that there is for buses, call the local police and denounce everything they occupy."
13871,2238703,5,RobyR,14/08/2022,"Very crowded and coveted free area, I recommend arriving early in the morning. A very clear sign warns you not to park in the space reserved for buses."
13871,2230572,5,jordimonipauet,13/08/2022,"Super comfortable area to visit Jaca! Water and well paved, 10 minutes from the center by stairs"
13871,2226344,5,millasiveco,13/08/2022,"Excellent site, both in summer and for skiing in winter for years we have not had problems. The regulatory ordinance of the parking of motorhomes and approved housing vehicles of Jaca considers in article 4 as a motorhome or housing vehicles the following technical sheet numbers 2448 (housing van), 3148 (mixed housing), 3248 and 3348 (housing motorhome)"
13871,2220440,3,Jordi25312,12/08/2022,"The assessment, more than for the area is for the people. Every time there is less respect for the rest of autoracavaneros. Normal that many municipalities refuse to make areas for cars. People extracting the ores where you can't. Others with strong television until so many in the morning. A real shame. It does not represent the majority of the group."
13871,2216176,5,cmur85,11/08/2022,"Excellent free area with filling and emptying of water. Wide spaces, perhaps more would be needed, the only problem, the mini campers….they occupy a space that is not theirs. For the rest Great. +1 for the municipality of Jaca."
13871,2211405,5,rachaelmharri,10/08/2022,"5 stars from us because we managed, through sheer luck, to get a place late afternoon.  It really is a lottery.  Great spot to let your dog run free right next door.  Silent at night.  No noise from the buses next door.  Perfect for walking into old town and grey/black water changes."
13871,2201189,5,elviajemehizoami,09/08/2022,"Free area for 24 AC a step away from the center of Jaca. Well-mounted unloading area, playground and a closed dog-walking area right next door. The only thing it doesn't have is light. If it's full there's another one in the municipality, in this case on the outskirts... I really don't understand the comments below. A 10 for Jaca."
13871,2176449,4,davsm,05/08/2022,"Parking very well located, but small for such a large and tourist town. We arrived and everything was full, so we emptied the water and parked in an adjoining street, to be able to take a walk around Jaca. We had to leave because they seem to be very strict about AC and camper parking. I don't want fines. If you get a parking space it's worth staying."
13871,2164989,1,poljr5,02/08/2022,"Everything full and campers that could be in the next street taking place of the AC. In the area in front (bus parking) and on the street the police tell us that they are going to fine us, they also tell us that if we park in the town they will not fine the same. Bad treatment of the people to the AC…"

Half shade, half sun depending on the time. Usually quite frequented, although they also park around the area. In general, GREAT to spend one night/s."

13871,2126310,5,Inaxio23,26/07/2022,Perfect area to visit Jaca. It has about 8 squares with shade and as many others without it. Nearby containers and correct and free filling and emptying service.
13871,2105300,4,rafauskiv,22/07/2022,"Good place fills up early and lots of ghost RVs. Too bad... a bit of a bad smell in some areas but bearable. If you can't find a place, there are safe and comfortable nearby streets... even better for your camper."
13871,2102865,5,coadriana,21/07/2022,"we arrived at one o'clock and parked in the shade, all very correct, the little park next to it is very good to entertain the little ones. very close to the center but it is at another height."
13871,2084904,4,JenetVictor,17/07/2022,Good for doing services. There are a few “sucker” motorhomes. Great for walking around town. Half of the parking spaces for motorhomes are not in the shade.
13871,2080897,3,SPIZA,16/07/2022,"We stop to do some shopping to continue on our way. Well located area to visit Jaca, little charm but to sleep it seems a quiet and safe place."

13871,2070006,5,Marclashter,13/07/2022,"Parking super accessible, clean and with all free services and completely flat. We have been very good but fighting for the shade that only gives to one side. Next to a giant area for dogs and very close to the old town of Jaca, a ten for this car park."
13871,2058583,4,mlanzon,10/07/2022,"Not bad, if your vehicle is not classified as a motorhome I do not recommend that you come, the Local Police have fined two campers that I suppose are not as a motorhome or home vehicle, very strong odors from the unloading area, the nearby places will suffer"
13871,2045425,5,DavidIranzo,07/07/2022,We didn't stay here because it was full of ac. But great for discharging grays and blacks and filling clean water.
13871,2044728,5,pachecoibiza,06/07/2022,"very good place to visit old town. Come early because it fills up fast. To our surprise, being in the area today, we found a van selling fruit directly from the orchard, at a very good price and of very good quality, and the vendors are also very friendly. they come to the area every Wednesday from 7 to 8 pm more or less... recommended if you happen to be passing through."
13871,2036642,5,ceciykris,04/07/2022,"Free with grey, black and filling water services. A 10 minute walk from the cathedral and the citadel. Ideal for a walk.

The gray and black emptying services are free, also the filling"
13871,2031017,5,ToyotaMann,02/07/2022,Good place for one night with supply and disposal large children's playground. In the city you can eat well on the outskirts there is a large shopping center with a cheap gas station
13871,2030819,4,ESCARTIN,02/07/2022,"A complete area, well located, with all free services. a Ten for the Town Hall. I do not give it five stars, because there are motorhomes that take time and do not move, nor is there anyone. The Campers occupy the motorhome spaces and you are left out. A little vigilance and it would be Five Star."

I've been to apartments, I've skied, I've eaten,... and now that I have a car, it's all time and space problems. I think that anyone who has known Jaca for years will understand this, there is no right to what has happened, and I never go when it is really saturated. finally sad"

We believe that they are going to pay for it, because there is an entry barrier and an exit barrier prepared. The emptying and filling area is under construction, although people are using it.

13871,1641832,1,jorge79,12/10/2021,"Always full, practically the same ones always and if you park outside you will be fined. It is unfortunately the attitude that many people are taking with motorhomes, totally contrary to those of us who have been in this for many years."
13871,1641536,3,ToniAgudo,12/10/2021,"We were thinking of spending the night here, but it smelled super strong of human feces and of course we didn't want to finally stay. The site is great, free emptying and filling. When I went there were more than half of empty places, the parking lots measure 9 meters by 3."
13871,1639851,5,davidauto33,11/10/2021,We stop to fill and empty. Comfortable and fast.
13871,1637582,3,povilas393,10/10/2021,Not the best motorhome area we stayed for sure but everything is free. There should be at least 50 more spaces for campers since it is almost impossible to get space even at this time of the year.
13871,1635182,4,sunnybird,09/10/2021,"A beautiful simple motorhome near the old town. You only have to go up 79 steps and you are in the beautiful town. It is well worth a visit. We are here at the beginning of October and the places are already taken early in the afternoon. While one camper after another comes driving in all evening. In no time at all, all surrounding parking spaces will be full of campers."
13871,1628021,1,chaparro,05/10/2021,"The area is very well but Jaca with its imminent new Municipal Ordinance will prohibit parking any vehicle, home or vehicle where it is suspected that it is used to spend the night outside the authorized area, so WE ARE NOT WELCOME and of course neither our money. Goodbye Jaca and goodbye to your shops."
13871,1614212,4,cris0k,28/09/2021,We just fill and empty and everything is very good and comfortable. although there is only one area so hopefully you won't have to wait long.
13871,1608370,4,chirlota,25/09/2021,"I have been sleeping in this area several times. All right. Quiet zone. Silent 5 minutes walk from the center of Jaca. In the middle of the afternoon, the vehicles begin to arrive and the parking spaces fill up. If you want to park you should not go too late."
13871,1606005,4,Remesal,25/09/2021,"Right, we did a quiet night. all clean"
13871,1604851,5,patSommavilla,24/09/2021,"Perfect, in the shade, close to the center."
13871,1595320,4,Meigaleon,20/09/2021,Free area and very close to the center. There is a playground and an enclosed area for dogs. It has water refueling and gray water drainage
13871,1593379,4,agarciago,19/09/2021,I could give it a five star rating but if there were at least 20 more places. it is very small. most of us have gone to the surroundings. Anyway sincere thanks to this city council for having this area. thanks a lot.
13871,1590939,1,VALLESCOM,19/09/2021,"It seems like a very good area, but there are colleagues who stay all weekend (from the rest of Europe). I arrived on Friday afternoon at 4:00 p.m. and it was complete. I went to another parking lot and spent Saturday at 11, 13, 15h and it was the same AC on Friday. The saddest thing is that they took the chairs outside as if it were a camping site. Other ACs parked in the bus zone and the police fined them."
13871,1589126,5,damac,18/09/2021,"Very pleasant and quiet area despite the proximity of the center with free water, garbage and parking services. Shaded place for the first arrivals, in the sun for the following ones and elsewhere for the latecomers because the historic center is very pleasant."
13871,1580596,4,mafude,15/09/2021,Quiet area and very close to the center. Basic services and fairly flat to park. Perfect to see the city. I recommend going early as it fills up very quickly. Thank you Jaca for having areas of this type for motorhomes.
13871,1573319,5,shiz4a,12/09/2021,"Excellent facilities
great location.
Very popular so often full.

13871,1549004,5,Sulaspt,05/09/2021,Thanks to the Jaca town hall for having a well located free area with good services. It is a fairly quiet but very crowded area. It would be appreciated if there was another area in the city or to enable another area for the parking of buses since they share half of the space with camper vehicles.
13871,1548386,5,stela9,05/09/2021,"A 10 for Jaca and its Motorhome area. 2 min walk from the center, clean, free, shady and quiet at night. Hopefully more like this"
13871,1544697,4,CHABIZGZ,03/09/2021,"It is a good place, well located, 5 minutes from the main street, with all free services, some shady squares, in a quiet area and next to a children's playground ... But it has become too small ... Jaca It is a very important point in this area, and the influx of visitors, and more with the boom of ACs and vans that we live, makes those 24 places very insufficient ..."
13871,1538140,4,dbraekr,01/09/2021,"Well located for visiting the center. had a quiet night. given the bar was up, stood for free. helaaq the parking is then used as a shortcut..."
13871,1538109,4,MiguelMedina,01/09/2021,"Central area as comrades comment, although it has poles with connectors for light, they do not work. The negative part is the fast and fast circulation of passenger cars. I would ask the City Council for control since it could cause accidents, there are children and people around the Motorhomes. For the rest, many thanks to the City Council and those responsible for tourism in Jaca."
13871,1537509,4,imar,01/09/2021,"Parking near the center and very complete, shade and fairly level, always very full, we arrived at night and had to sleep in the nearby streets well parked, nobody told us anything, the police arrive from time to time and control those who park in the site of the buses..very good for Jaca"
13871,1527411,4,tevenac,29/08/2021,"Well placed near the city center and the citadel. At 12 o'clock it was full, a lot of CC waiting around."
13871,1513205,4,kimete,25/08/2021,"Very close to the center, the location takes you to the exit of the area. Now, in August, arrive in the morning, otherwise it is possible that you will not find a place. quiet, trash recycling right outside. we will repeat out of season. pass the cops regularly. Watch out for those who sleep outside the area or in the bus zone."
13871,1506990,5,gonzalopulido,24/08/2021,"Very good area, with enough shade and close to the center, 5 min. walking, many cars go and there is a queue to load and unload, very quiet and level,"
13871,1503655,1,itziarpiano,23/08/2021,"Be very careful with parking on the road when the area is full (very frequent). There were many motorhomes parked, and we have trusted. We have been fined € 200 for trespassing on the sidewalk."
13871,1502498,4,javixu77,23/08/2021,"Free parking, ideal for visiting Jaca, a charming city with lots of life, the only bad thing is few shady squares."
13871,1492672,5,mariamgm,21/08/2021,"It is a parking lot, but it is very well located to see Jaca, there is a park for children and a very good area for dogs with benches, a fountain ... it is recommended to go early to find a place, it is usually full. Do not park in the area destined for BUS, since we saw how they fined a couple of motorhomes"
13871,1488190,3,palomita,20/08/2021,"It has a playground, it is fine without being any wonder"
13871,1487310,3,llunadana,20/08/2021,The area is very well how embarrassing are those who seem to spend the summer in the area
13871,1466884,5,moncayo69,16/08/2021,"Ideal place to visit jaca, we have spent a very quiet night"
13871,1466274,4,subetealpaisaje,16/08/2021,"Great area to visit the city. Shameful the behavior of those who park in the places designated for coaches. If you cannot find a space, you cannot occupy the vehicle space that the only place they have to park is there. Anyway..."
13871,1464423,4,Campaneros,16/08/2021,"Good Parking with shades, services and close to the city. The bad thing is that it is usually always full; the good thing, that there are more areas to park nearby and you can use this as a loading and unloading point."
13871,1458780,4,selmar89,15/08/2021,Great area and very close to the center. All it needs is light ... don't arrive later than noon when you run out of space.
13871,1458603,2,txikicamper,15/08/2021,"When we arrived the parking lot was full of AC. We decided to park in the parking lots just outside the parking lot, no problem staying overnight. But we would not return, many cars pass through the area, there is a lot of noise throughout the night."
13871,1453889,2,fafatex,14/08/2021,"Good just to drain and fill up with water. Very noisy, very little shade, convenient for visiting Jaca. We did not stay to sleep."
13871,1452599,3,soquete,13/08/2021,"Too many people, people washing dishes in the Poti tap, tables, chairs ... it seems like a commune, the place is very central but either they put control or that will end up being a dung heap."
13871,1446156,1,alicialm,12/08/2021,"I write the review just to ask motorhomes that they do not like other vehicles to occupy the places reserved for them, they do not occupy the places reserved for buses that are next door. When we arrived it was very crowded and instead of parking where it should not be, we moved to Sabiñánigo and the matter was settled."
13871,1439892,3,zuri25,11/08/2021,"It is full, there is constant movement of motorhomes in the water area ... Stifling in August"
13871,1434764,5,FJOB,10/08/2021,In summer it fills up easily but there is parking nearby or you can park in another car park. Do not park in the bus area
13871,1431546,5,susocbr,09/08/2021,"Fabulous area in a beautiful city. A little reminder, when the area is full, you cannot park in the bus zone. DENOUNCE. And with reason of course. There are several more car parks in the city to park without problems"
13871,1428838,5,luzecita,09/08/2021,"Good site to fill and empty, shady sites and free. Next to a playground with a fountain."
13871,1428428,3,ekinet,09/08/2021,"It is a good place to park, it is next to the center, if you find a place. We have been in August and it is a coming and going from AC to empty the gray, black and catch water, for now it is free. It is better to find a place away from the service area because of the queues that can form, odors and constant noise from engines."
13871,1419522,3,palombus47,07/08/2021,7:00 p.m. full like an egg and tight like sardines (Spanish) We preferred a parking lot near the supermarket
13871,1411225,4,Danemfi,06/08/2021,"Good place to visit the city, shady squares, emptying and filling"
13871,1410266,4,etxebeiturriaga,05/08/2021,"It is very good, and next to the center. On weekends and holidays it is a lottery to catch a site."
13871,1409414,4,RACARSERCA,05/08/2021,"Very good site and very good for the city of Jaca by offering these services. We couldn't stay as it was full. A shame that some people set tables so that they do not take away their parking while they load and unload the waters. Say that next to the Jaca Military Barracks, on the Pamplona highway, on the right hand side, there is an esplanade to spend the night, in case this is complete."
13871,1408107,4,Remolin,05/08/2021,"Area next to the city center, very quiet place and many shady squares"
13871,1407792,3,mglez,05/08/2021,We went late and it was packed. Just outside the area there were more sites with several motorhomes and camper and we stayed there. The night was regular as the passing cars were loud.
13871,1403124,3,Sorifer90,04/08/2021,"The area is fine, it has the necessary services. You have to go early if you want to get a place."
13871,1382566,5,Anitibel,30/07/2021,Great place for emptying and filling. If there is no place to stay there are very good parking areas in nearby towns.
13871,1378837,5,Cris_Arnau86,29/07/2021,Fantastic to visit Jaca. there are very few places. There is a children's playground next door and a pipican.
13871,1378331,1,manuiceman1,29/07/2021,"The place is phenomenal, but if you don't have a motorhome, the local police will make you leave, we go with an approved camper and they made us leave. Too bad we will return to Jaca never again"
13871,1375565,4,gon943,28/07/2021,"Thank you Jaca City Council for this area, it will revert to the benefit of the people. Whenever we come it is full, you should check those that are there for many days. It would not hurt to charge a symbolic price per day and a limit of days"
13871,1374625,4,pakito75,28/07/2021,"Very good area, central and with filling and emptying of all the waters.It is to thank the Aytos like this for thinking of us."
13871,1374303,4,Mery4985,28/07/2021,"It is always usually full, but you can use the water services, without having to park. You can find parking outside."
13871,1364908,4,Hoodma,25/07/2021,"Well, although it was full and we had to go somewhere else, the area is fantastic, it has many places and it has become too small from what I have been able to see ... (there are more and more of us). All services for coaches and free. Thanks for the bet but we would still have to reconsider expanding places."
13871,1357096,5,amr01,24/07/2021,"We are in the area of Jaca, we really liked it, it is full of cars in the bus area and parked all around. I heeded Rossemary's recommendation and went to the Las Nieves restaurant. Really good."
13871,1352012,4,loky17,22/07/2021,"Extraordinary as locations very close to the city and all free services on the other hand you have to arrive early, thank you to the municipality"
13871,1349965,4,Paichi,22/07/2021,"It is shady and close to the Old Town. It is difficult to find a place, although when we arrived there were two. But if not, you can park in the streets next door. The maps got us wrong. After the roundabout, after doing it, it says take the first right, ignore it, go straight ahead. Otherwise it leads to the exit of the Area. It is shared with buses"
13871,1345046,4,laurea,20/07/2021,"Very well, in high season it is difficult to find a place. Free I quiet."
13871,1338753,4,EuskalArrantzalea,19/07/2021,"Good place to spend the night! The bad thing is that if you have a camper without a bathroom, you have to figure it out"
13871,1329334,5,xgoReus,16/07/2021,Thank you Jaca for this free area. Very well located to see Jaca going up the stairs to the main street. many very spacious parking spaces even for very large motorhomes.
13871,1327779,5,Rossemary,15/07/2021,"Every year we come from the South and pass through Jaca. We love it, and like us, the rest, because every time the area is more crowded. The good thing, if it is complete, they let us park and spend the night around, as long as we are well parked. It would be good if they expanded the area, or reconvert some bus seats that are rarely occupied. Recommended: Las Nieves restaurant."
13871,1327224,4,micksalter,15/07/2021,"Our first visit to this site, it was full, today we returned and there was plenty of spaces.  We only stayed for part of the day to visit the lovely castle and walk around the city.  Had we not had other plans, we would have stayed the night, as it had a quiet feel."
13871,1321930,5,lidi_ss,13/07/2021,"It's very good! It has a playground next to it, we only stayed for the day but at night we would have stayed."

13871,1311588,5,minicampernv200,10/07/2021,"AC is well located, free and with a service for draining and filling the water and draining the toilet, there are always many users, so if you arrive in the afternoon it can be full"
13871,1304933,5,Familiariojana,08/07/2021,A great success for the city council to provide a free site for motorhomes with services included and a 5-minute walk from the center
13871,1302791,4,pericoGR,07/07/2021,"Quiet and well located with the necessary free services but excessively crowded, at least on these dates, so you have to come with time since you find it full and the one that comes out is replaced quickly. Near the center of town. The initiative of the municipality is appreciated. Do not park in the bus area as the police pass by .."
13871,1302372,4,ammolero,07/07/2021,"A great, clean and quiet area and a stone's throw from the city center."
13871,1285272,3,kascoxu,29/06/2021,Quiet area near the center. 50 meters around the playground you come to a dog park closed with a wooden fence.

13871,1278074,4,jbchris,26/06/2021,Very good place. The soil of the gray water drainage is a little degraded. you have to arrive around 3:00 p.m. to hope for a place. Thank you to the town hall for maintaining this place where everything is free.We spent 2 perfect nights there
13871,1277041,4,javimetal,25/06/2021,"It is very good, but I give it 4 stars because we no longer fit, it has become too small. we slept very comfortably right in front. good initiative of the city council."

13871,1124952,4,Didiruca06,28/12/2020,"A luxury to be able to enjoy the area and of course Jaca, few AC but normal because of the blissful pandemic that we are going through.

13871,1054801,2,avc1981,17/09/2020,The area is great but you can go to fuck all those who stay to live here literally. I have been in the area for days moving to do activities and in the evening when I arrive in Jaca the same ones in the same place for more than 5 days. And I'm not talking about one or two vehicles. very nice but bad management

It is 10 minutes from the center of Jaca on foot. recommendable!"
13871,1006073,5,Milbasura,27/08/2020,Very spacious places a tad inclined but nothing that is not solved with chocks. 5 minutes walk from the center. If you can't find a place (we arrived in the summer and there were only two left) you can park in the bus parking that is attached. People also park in the surroundings.
13871,1003462,4,brunocb,26/08/2020,"Good place to visit the city. It is not allowed to be located in the bus zone, the local police sanction. It also penalizes vans that occupy the sites set up for ACs and campers. However, the police themselves told us that it was allowed to park without camping in any area of the city."
13871,979860,5,PacoNavas,19/08/2020,"Thanks to the Jaca city council! Excellent place to visit Jaca and perfect to spend the night. Very crowded in August, in the afternoon it gets crowded."

13871,928516,5,Bicha17,04/08/2020,"Spectacular area! It is quite full but hopefully you find a place. Finally, other ACs were parked at the BUS and the police passed by and said nothing. Our second night was spent on the next street because there was no gap and no problem. Quiet and the best place to visit Jaca! Beware of booking the site with motorcycles ... It is not fair. The crane took a ... And rightly so! Thanks Jaca!"

13871,876654,5,Mollerussamonamur,17/07/2020,"Wonderful area to know Jaca, which has pleasantly surprised us, with its alleys, the Cathedral and its fantastic Citadel. The area has all the water services and, as in almost all the good areas, its problem, the space, we spent the night and the only one is that in the early morning some thugs came to make noise expressly near the parking lot. Thank you very much to the city of Jaca."
13871,874369,5,agulinaress,17/07/2020,"Perfect area to visit jaca and the area. Free water services. The second night was full, I called the local police and they told me that you can't stay in the bus area. They sent me behind the ice rink."
13871,869220,4,Agutito,14/07/2020,"Recommended, very quiet area and close to the center. It is worth spending one night and being able to visit Jaca"
13871,862839,3,JLYR,12/07/2020,"Only interest: the services and the location close to the center. Otherwise Motorhomes lined up, few places so the others wait their turn .... Good for visiting the city, if you find space, the Guardia Civile prohibiting parking on the bus sites."
13871,860785,5,tomel33,11/07/2020,"Very beautiful area, beautiful wide and shaded pitches. Unfortunately it was full when I arrived last night. But we were able to park in the adjacent street. Five minutes walk from the city center. Thank you to the town for the welcome."

13871,848094,4,LaHeisenberg,04/07/2020,"Very well located. Going up a street you are in the center of Jaca. The bad, few places, in high season it is difficult to get a place. But it seems like they let you park right next to the bus stub. Yesterday there were many motorhomes in that part and the police said nothing. There is a very nice playground right next to it. Good free site!"
13871,842199,4,fufufurgoneta,30/06/2020,"Good stopping place en route, next to a very complete playground and close to the center. Well-leveled parking lots. All services included."

13871,778203,4,RaulSJ,09/02/2020,"The area is pretty good, it's free and it has to empty gray and black and fill water. The problem is that it is always always full, and watch out for fines, because if you don't park right between the lines they fine you."
13871,772863,3,jorge79,26/01/2020,Very good area but supersaturated it is very difficult to have room. Be careful when parking outside because you usually pass the local police to throw those who are occupying part of the sidewalk with the back.
13871,772859,4,autostar47,26/01/2020,Did a quiet night advise any free service ???
13871,767768,5,rob_machin,12/01/2020,"This is a great stop over right in the town of Jaca,  really nice and quite place for a good nights sleep, very bizzy so be prepared for no space, some folks were parking in the bus station area which this aire shares, and nobody seemed to mind,, 4 minutes walk up into the very pleasant town, all services, you do have to pay for electric,,,, but if not it's a free stop..."

13871,766850,4,Gorkaravan,10/01/2020,"Very crowded, they threw us (rightly) for being badly parked, like another 20 more ... Alternative between Mercadona and military headquarters more than acceptable. No services but quiet to spend the night."
13871,764537,5,psviteri,05/01/2020,"We have taken a miracle site. There are only 24, and they fill up right away. Better first thing is when people move. Anyway, in the supermarket area there are many other parking lots that can be used without problems."
13871,761333,4,nocillastrip,01/01/2020,"Fill in Christmas. We only use it for emptying and filling, thinking about the shortage of emptying points in the Tena Valley. All right."
13871,760065,4,Txavito,30/12/2019,"We have spent many nights, yes, always out of it because we have never found a single free site. There is demand to make another 10 times larger. In the end they will expand to the bus zone"
13871,757837,4,JuliaEtaMikel,27/12/2019,"Very busy area very close to the historic center of Jaca, although there was no place when we arrived, we parked next door and there were many more motorhomes outside the area. Free water filling / emptying service. Very nice town. Recommendable."

13871,751487,5,camperpete,08/12/2019,Stayed couple nights early Dec.. was 1st spot on left near non working elec barrier and 4 non working elec points.. nice and handy for town ...take steep steps or the uphill road into town !..was busy Dec and people overflowed into the bus park nextdoor..locals seem to use it as a rat run through and  a kids park behind but all in all good for town parking
13871,750952,5,Lledo,07/12/2019,"We arrived late and there was no place, we slept in a bus zone since there was a lot of space and more parked, we took it off early and there were free places (weird thing) it is very close to the center! Thank you very much Jaca for this area!"
13871,750149,4,padraigl,05/12/2019,"This is a large level tarmac parking area for motorhomes with tree shade. Behind is a dedicated bus parking area. They spaces are not suitable for really large motorhomes or motorhomes with trailers. The maximum stay is 72 hours.

Pros:
Free parking.
Free full services excluding electricity.
Local supermarkets, restaurants, cafes and bars. 
Tree shade.

Cons:
None.

There are full free services excluding electricity.

The grey drain has ok flow direction into the center grate but you need to have your waste pipe close to the grate. The cement around the drain is broken up so there are some puddles.

The black WC drain is 600mm off the ground under a steel cover. The drain pipe is large with no splashback. The cassette push button tap beside the drain has excessive pressure hence some splashback. 

The fresh water tap is a medium screw-on connection with excellent pressure. The tap has a 3/4 turn handle  to regulate the flow.

There are large bins in the carpark.

Beside the Aire is a kids play area and an enclosed dog play area.
To reach the town there are some steps to navigate. It's possible to avoid the steps but it's a longer walk.
There are plenty of restaurants and cafe/bars in the town. The citadel/castle on the opposite side of the town cost €8 to enter.
Carrefour shopping center and gas station is about 8 minutes drive away.
This is a Camino town so there are walks following the yellow signs. There is lovely 4 hour return walk to Castillo de Java towards the mountains. There is also a walk down by the river, just follow the river out the countryside for as long as you want.

We had 1 very quiet night here. We had stayed before down by the river when the Aire was full so we know the town well.

Bugs/Mosquitoes. (They love us..)
We did not encounter any mosquitoes here in the end of November."

13871,730345,5,emjauk,26/10/2019,"Just spent 2 nights here.
Aire is very popular with all spaces filled by 5pm and van circling the area trying to find parking.
The last 2 spaces in bus parking where used without complaint.
Waste facilities good and free water.

Lovely town. Plenty to see and some great walks all marked out, different colours to follow depending how long you want to go.
The blue route down by the river was very nice.
Buses do start up about 8am."

13871,706711,4,Lunila,28/09/2019,"When we arrived it was full so we slept in the next street along with other motor homes. A little noise in the morning when buses start, since parking is shared. Otherwise, if you find a clear place."

An esplanade that looked like where the market is mounted. Very calm. Then in the tourist office they told us that in front of the river we could also park and we moved there where we slept super quiet. Thank you Jaca City Council !!!! It is certainly a place where they want us! Even the woman in the tourist office was a former motorhome! A 10!"
13871,688031,5,cath73,12/09/2019,"Perfect, close to the center, quiet at night but at 18:30 the area was complete!"
13871,686161,5,WanderWebb,11/09/2019,Very popular aire that fills rapidly in the afternoon. Very central and surprisingly quiet given its vicinity to roads and residential areas.

13871,671346,5,minivantravel,01/09/2019,"Very quiet area, well located, free. Large, level and some shaded plots. Clean and free emptying area. Perfect and recommended. Just say that sometimes it stays small and there are places missing! Thank you very much Jaca for such a well maintained site."
13871,663641,4,clones,27/08/2019,"Perfect for visiting the city, free emptying and filling services. There are few places left in season but there are many options in the Mercadona area. Recommended for lunch of Casa Fau rations in the historic center in front of the cathedral, all very good"
13871,657307,4,gucaval51,24/08/2019,Good rest area but still very crowded. It takes luck in the high season to find a place. Also used as a camper service by crews in transit

13871,618740,4,denech17,11/08/2019,"All right, everything is free. Too bad anarchist squatters empty their sewage in front of everyone without any shame. Result, when it's free there is everything."
13871,593917,4,padraigl,02/08/2019,"Did not stay as it was full but used the services.
The services are at the exit.

The grey drain is a normal ground drain. The cement is a little rough so there are small puddles around the drain.

The black WC drain is 600mm off the ground under a cover with its own push button tap. The only drawback is the pressure is too high to fill the cassette and you will be drowned with water.

The fresh water tap is a medium screw-on at the opposite side of the black WC tap. Its a 3/4 turn handle with very strong pressure."
13871,591639,3,AnaEsther,01/08/2019,"We did not park in the area and this we arrived at 12 and something, because it was full and one keeping a place, but we did it next door, in a wide street and the premises passed and well. Now, I don't know if the residence time is met. Well, the question, from the area to the center goes very well, the children's park great, if you go for tapas I recommend the Tasca de Ana, luxury (do not go home Lola, treats the non-local fatal) and do not get lost See the citadel. Thanks to the municipality."

I still could do the services and find a place next to the bus parking, at the end of the day there were about twenty camper parked around the air, I did not sleep there. This air is a victim of its success. Jaca is a very pretty city, with this day also an atmosphere of madness, it is Spain that I like."

After reading many of the comments on this site, I am surprised that you have not found any reviews regarding the area for dogs that are in front of the playground. It's a dog park with a fountain, and very extensive, and that's why I'm surprised that nobody has said anything about this."
13871,540209,5,JORDI2EURA,05/07/2019,"Area for now for free, although everything is ready (barriers, tiketi salesman) to be able to control the stay and collection. According to the tourism office, it is only a bureaucratic problem for those in charge of the administration. Anyway, even if you have to pay, it is a very well located area, with shade, flat and with wide spaces for vehicles. Recommended"

To have all the city facilities only a 10 minute walk away is great and to stay here is ‘FREE’ Yes it can get busy and some noise but is that not what a city is all about! For those negative comments about noise I suggest staying in a quiet village outside the city. Jaca is full of life, Spanish culture, restaurants, tapas bars and boutiques etc.. Thank you so much to the municipality for providing these facilities and once again it’s ‘Free’"

We slept well there!"

Unfortunately, the council has not thought that there are almost 4km to the center, with a 250m drop in altitude (in some sections up to 12% slope). How are we going to do that kilometer uphill to consume and then go down with the shopping bags or after a feast? Obviously we won't."

In the loading and unloading area there is a hatch in the floor to empty the sewage. don't use the font! there is a little sign that says WC, but it is to clarify it, not to throw the water around. It's stuck and it sucks. Let's take care of the areas that enable us! There is a photo of the hatch in the publication"

13970,2954424,2,lcgkt,12/07/2023,Correct to sleep but it is a parking lot next to a train station (without traffic at night) without any charm. The best thing about the area is the town without a doubt.
13970,2831793,3,luismi-izq,08/06/2023,"Comfortable area to spend the night, but the sewage area is impossible to use without everything spilling out and being able to rinse. And the town is a bit disappointing."

13970,2509137,5,WanderWebb,30/11/2022,A great stopover and ideal for visiting Santander or before/after a ferry crossing. Train right outside taking you in by foot if you want a day visit. Nice little town with plenty of eateries. Very quiet overnight. Short parking bays so most motorhomes will be out of the marked bay but it’s in a designated motorhome area so really shouldn’t cause a problem with sensible and considerate parking by everyone.
13970,2500787,4,maximezoe,20/11/2022,"Very good, all free, it's nice. A stone's throw from the center and the historic part as well as two self-service laundromats. It's a pity that the places are not well delimited, the large motorhomes park along and take at least 3 to 4 places..."

There are two water intakes and the one with a thread is the one next to the black ones, so we don't trust it to fill it up. Next to the station, so to spend the night very quietly, it is better to go to the lawn next to it (signposted as provisional parking)"

13970,1809114,4,Odrakir,07/04/2022,"The town is beautiful and the parking lot is close to everything. It is next to the station so there is train noise (1 hour from 7:00 to 24:00, I think I remember).

13970,1401596,1,saragarridop,04/08/2021,When we arrived it was all full of cars except two AC. And that makes it very clear painted on the floor that it is ONLY for AC. There were two free spots left while we emptied. They parked two cars and we very politely told them it was the AC zone. Answer: what about me? I am the authority (and various other jewels). Our only answer: you are rude. We will not return

13970,982934,3,Viajerohappy,19/08/2020,"I confirm the previous comment a good parking to visit a beautiful town. With a comfortable area to change the water, but what some dirty man said that does not even stop to look at the empty black water in the clean water source, putting all the floor full of excrement and paper as you can be so DONKEY / PIG is incredible."
13970,982224,2,jgoiko,19/08/2020,"The truth is that it cannot be considered an area since it is a car park that is used interchangeably and for trucks. The only thing it has is to empty and fill the water that unfortunately there are certain people who are dirty or do not know where to empty the sewage and they have done it in the source, it was all disgusting. The good thing is that it is next to the town and it is appreciated."
13970,979086,4,Van_alaaventura,18/08/2020,"We have come to empty and fill and spend the night. People are either very dirty or not very clean, they had emptied the sewage into the fountain to fill it up and it was all disgusting ... on the other hand, very close to the center and everything very close at hand !!!

13970,948311,4,luiscallejar,10/08/2020,"It is in the same town. With all free services. We should be more civic and when the motorhome spaces are occupied, not occupy those of trucks and buses. While we were there, a truck driver arrived and was rightly angry because the caravans and campers had parked in the truck bay. The man was distressed because he could not park and he fulfilled the tachograph. We should be civic and not touch noses where we are treated well. We recommend Las Hijas del Pez bar to eat."

13970,925488,5,NomadasCharlatanes,03/08/2020,"We had a great night. We arrived Sunday and there was a lot of movement of motorhomes and cars, but it is perfect to visit the town and do mountain routes. 100% recommended."
13970,920763,3,miguel1985,02/08/2020,"Good place to visit the town, one of the most beautiful in Cantabria. The AC itself, as it does not have more, a pk of asphalt, where on the weekend there is a lot of movement of people, cars and it is necessary to share the area with cars, trucks, trailers. It has a filling and emptying area and a nearby playground."

If I give it only 3 stars it is because the area is very noisy, since it is attached to the train tracks, the views and the surroundings are not the best and from 7 in the morning and throughout the day you have noises, also they park trucks what which makes even more noise."

13970,849472,4,Mizdo,05/07/2020,"The Area has all the essential services. The only but that I put is the absence of marks delimiting the spaces for motorhomes giving them a greater width which gives rise to chaos according to dates and days sharing the parking with cars. In any case, a big thank you to the City Council for thinking of us."

13970,699627,5,LucaVan,21/09/2019,"I spent one night here after visiting the Cabarceno park. I had been recommended this town and it really doesn't disappoint. The area of ac is the parking of the train station, but with the service of filling and emptying of water (gray and black). There are 2 faucets, one with thread for hose intakes. The squares are not small, but they are painted for what it was, a car park. Now there is the end zone for acs. I was surprised that on September 19 there were about 20 acs. To say that the town is beautiful. He deserves to spend a great day, walk and meal. The ac area is clean and maintained."

13970,447851,1,CapitanClick,01/04/2019,We arrived at night and the entire parking lot was full of construction material. There was hardly any light and being next to the train station did not guarantee the tranquility we were looking for. It gave us bad vibes and we left. A pity not to know this town that they say is very beautiful because of a bad care of this installation.
13970,435901,3,davidfge,03/03/2019,It lacks specific parking for motorhomes and and to clean blacks. Otherwise the area is fine.

To load water you have to carry a hose with a wide mouth because it is a fountain with a push button. the train takes you to Santander in 40 meters. emptying of blacks and grays. very good

Great move as this is a lovely town with great walks. Today we completed the PR-S-24, 15km circuit route in the hills. If you are into walking you must do it. A map can be got from tourist office or it can be downloaded and viewed on maps.me.
The parking is flat and we had a quite night. The carpark gets very busy in the evenings with people visiting the town.
There is a market in the town on a Sunday morning.
There are plenty of eating choices with the backstreet one's reasonably priced. After all it's a tourist town.."

Close to supermarkets and laundries and a shopping center 5 minutes away. The only drawback is that they do not control the stay or parking since of the 15 spaces it has there were 7 AC of neighbors who had them parked without further ado instead of parking on the streets where They live like some I had already seen."

There is to empty gray and for black it is on the other side diagonally. The only drawback that I put is that they park cars in the squares and in front, which makes maneuvering difficult. Don't need shims. Antequera is wonderful, we ate very well. We will be back"

To empty the gray water you have to do some maneuvers to get the motorhome in that are meaningless (it is outside the area, next to the parking lots) it has to fill water and empty gray but I did not see to empty black water (there were only grates). Easy to find and the surface is a little inclined but it is not necessary to put chocks."
13989,2788443,5,famvani,26/05/2023,Very generous in offering water and gray water drainage for free. Next door is a parking lot where you can probably spend the night. Not particularly pretty but very functional and in the middle of the city.

There is a shopping center nearby, and the city center is also relatively close. Unfortunately, I had the misfortune that on Wednesday after six o'clock in the morning, 50 young football players and a hundred of their parents, who brought them to a trip or a match, gathered at the parking lot and were waiting for the bus. And Spanel can't speak quietly, so it's an incredible noise."

We had no problem finding a space with the camper. Free emptying and filling of water and the place is quiet, to be in an urban context. Good place to stop or for one night."

Your ""overhang"" can then easily go into the berm. Then enough space for longer campers. We are 6.50m (with bikes 7.40m). Road is unfortunately quite noisy. Unfortunately. Opposite cafeteria for a good cup of coffee. Great place!"
13989,2537295,4,vikolomoku,01/01/2023,Ideal for visiting the city and to be able to empty gray and black water as well as refill the water. Too bad there are cars that park in the area and prevent the parking and mobility of vans and motorhomes.

The center can be reached on foot and this is also ok, but otherwise the campers are attached to each other, a lot of noise at night on weekends. The loading and unloading point was poorly designed, you have to exit the car park and maneuver in the middle of the road to get into it."

13989,2482041,4,soapyf,04/11/2022,"Obviously not designed by a motorhomer as if you prefer to park reversed in the angle of the bays can make it difficult to park if you follow the correct access/no entry signs.
can get busy and cars do park in the parking bays for motorhomes."

We parked in the last free space and behind us came several acs that had to leave, so you have to arrive on an ice floe to find a space. In the morning when we went to march we had several cars parked in front of us, although you can't and it made the maneuver a bit difficult to get out."
13989,2375013,5,AraleNoriMakina,15/09/2022,"Good place to spend the night, in front of the courts, (for sure), it's a bit noisy but bearable, near a shopping center, and restaurants and a churreria, to put a downside the cars that park in front in the morning, I think it is an area should be prohibited to park there."
13989,2367050,1,Jean-LouGosset,13/09/2022,"Not recommended, moreover, even if it's free I don't understand the previous comments? Very noisy places and relentless noise all night until morning."

We didn't get any heat. the area is great, a few meters away a playground with very cool slides. 10min walk from the town center. We were right at the fair and the atmosphere was great. recommended 100%"

13989,2017045,5,Evamgongo,27/06/2022,With services and very close to the shopping center in case you have to buy something to eat. Near the center of town. From here you can visit. Leisure area in a shopping center. Grateful to this town that has bet on our tourism. Next to the soccer field

13989,1925032,3,parknight1731,28/05/2022,It remains a car park but everything is operational. Downtown 15 minutes walk superb. Too bad the cars park in front and hamper maneuvers a bit
13989,1907694,3,Toja22,22/05/2022,"The area itself has nothing special,but services work and there are big rubbish containers.
There is a bar just opposite but we did not try it.Nothing else.
Antequera is a lovely city which really worths a visit and it's at about 10minutes walk.
When we arrived,at about 7.30pm,nearly all the spots were taken. We spent one night here."
13989,1907444,4,jeannicolejean,22/05/2022,"passed at the end of April, we stayed there during the day. convenient because near the center, free parking."
13989,1896917,3,JM-G,17/05/2022,Convenient as close to town but a bit noisy. Were inconvenienced to park (CC 8.20) due to cars parked along the sidewalk in front. Returned in the afternoon no problem because there were no more cars.
13989,1888496,4,140up,14/05/2022,"pk complete, but possibility of parking a little further on the slightly sloping right street. if not suitable area charming town, with beautiful arenas."

13989,1880740,3,MikaBallarika,10/05/2022,"Area very close to the road, for dogs it is not highly recommended. There is water, you can empty and 4G signal if you have to work."
13989,1875611,3,swifteurope,07/05/2022,close to town. no shade .. lots of traffic very close.. noise and deasel smell.  better options available .. we moved after a few hours .. see other locations.
13989,1873695,3,jdmostro,06/05/2022,It was almost full when we arrived at 3pm but with the trailer impossible to park. We found a place in the street that goes up at the end of the parking lot and spent a peaceful night there with other motorhomes.
13989,1870120,4,Casperdig,04/05/2022,Be early as it’s popular. 16 Moho’s & vans in designated parking area with another 12 alongside the stadium & a further 6 parked in roads nearby. Tolerated by police as they cruised by without stopping.
13989,1848461,3,Ralphdomi,23/04/2022,"Relatively flat, tar. Quickly occupied because only about ten places. Next to a busy street. Close to the city center on foot. One downside: strong tap pressure. thanks to the municipality"
13989,1822678,3,CagouilleExpress,15/04/2022,Not a crazy spot... Practical because it is possible to empty and refill the water for free and practical for visiting the city on foot but not a lot of space and next to the road.
13989,1820225,1,Merky,14/04/2022,"We had a bad experience in this area. At 06:30 am, some criminals began to hit our caravan and others with great force, blows after blows, they did so with other motorhomes and then fled. They were probably drunk kids from the area in the early hours of Thursday, April 14."
13989,1819134,3,josemaria27,13/04/2022,"A very small area for such a big town, very nice town we parked in a street a little further down to spend the day"
13989,1816584,3,Bertrand9258,12/04/2022,"Rare places, sloping, next to a street with day and night traffic. Better to park on rue C. Teresa Espinosa Moreno on the part without buildings. Town center and supermarket nearby. Automatic laundry at 900m but only cold programs, 30 and 60⁰."
13989,1807127,5,WanderWebb,05/04/2022,"Can’t give anything but full marks. Great location near to everything the wonderful Antequera has to offer. Free services - super strong water flow and separate fresh/cassette rinse taps. Quiet overnight. Best arrive early as it gets full, but there are plenty of tolerated alternative parking places nearby."
13989,1806015,2,Alanouille,04/04/2022,"Full parking on our arrival (around 3 p.m.) Possibility to park in the parking lot next to the dog park. The services work, the spots for black water and for drinking water are not side by side and each has a water tap. The problem is that the water is flowing very strongly.. Which prevented us from filling our tank.. Too bad"

13989,1789611,4,amigueln,20/03/2022,"It is well located near the center, it has services but it is very busy, it is true that there are parking lots around that are not bad and are quieter, I imagine that if it is very full the police do not tell you anything if you park elsewhere"
13989,1788327,3,alain1979,19/03/2022,"Motorhome drivers expect much more from Antequera. It is true that it is free, but it is not an area as such, although it can fill and empty water. A city like Antequera should have a much larger space set up, thus preventing us from leaving motorhomes on adjoining streets. A pity, with a larger area we would stop more days and leave more money in Antequera."
13989,1788237,5,AntonioNeiro,19/03/2022,"Thanks to the municipality of Antequera for this area with totally free services two steps from the center, notice for filling, I put a photo, come equipped. I'm sorry, don't take more photos."

Silent and calm area with many parks and green areas nearby if you travel with dogs. Supermarkets nearby. We only spent one night."

13989,1742355,4,AdriaPGX,27/01/2022,"Handy as only a 10 min walk into the historic and central parts of town. Do need to use levellers when parked up - the nearer the water and waste facility (at the far end opposite Calle Oaxaca) the more level it is.
Thanks to the town for providing this facility."
13989,1742303,3,pat42000,27/01/2022,"very good for visiting the city which is super pretty, it is not an area but a car park on the side of the road! not too much space because Spanish motorhomes use it as a garage! however there is water and we can drain cassette and gray water."
13989,1741396,2,bkb,26/01/2022,Full in the early afternoon. There were about fifteen of us parked in the adjacent street. Quiet night.

Only note: there are 16 places and this January 13th 8 places are occupied by Spanish motorhomes which must use the place as free parking to the detriment of passing motorhomes.
13989,1731637,1,Rulo6,10/01/2022,"We passed but it was full, it is not level and it is a parking lot not too beautiful. There are several places nearby on the outskirts of town much better!"
13989,1731532,3,WindySouls,10/01/2022,Pitches all used when we arrived ... Slightly sloping and in a busy street. We took advantage of our oil changes and went 100m down a flat street and close to 2-3 other CCs.

13989,1727578,3,hwneumann,06/01/2022,"Not exactly nice, more like a mostly crowded, narrow parking lot for caravans. Supply and disposal is flawless, you only need an adapter to an internal thread to connect the water hose ... But the watering can always works."
13989,1726977,3,LMV17,05/01/2022,Almost impossible to catch a place ... better make use of the facilities and park where you can to visit the city and spend the night going up to the torcal. a parking lot with views of the great castle
13989,1718563,1,eliasperez,29/12/2021,"SHAME, parking for the people of Antequera who own motorhomes. They can be seen to have been parked for a long time. City Hall, what are you waiting for? You can park around."
13989,1716819,4,JuanLlorca,27/12/2021,"Area close to the center, although a little uneven. If the area is full in the neighboring streets you can spend the night without problem."
13989,1710583,3,maloox89,15/12/2021,"Good free spot to empty wastewaters but pipes must have problems as it overflows on the road.
People please don't throw your chemical toilet in the first place you find (the water fountain) there is a clear little man-hole with written WC!
Did not refill as the water tap (with the thread) is used also to rinse cassettes and some users are just filthy and stick the whole cassette up the tap."

13989,1705336,3,zurix,07/12/2021,We have only filled and emptied. To fill water you need a male thread because it has a mouth like the fountains. To sleep we recommend a parking lot in a large esplanade next to the Alcazaba.

13989,1611048,5,vitoro,26/09/2021,"A perfect area and within the urban area. Very safe place (the courts opposite and the police station 50m away). The bar across the street didn't bother us (and that was Saturday). It has a source of drinking water to recharge, and a place for gray and black dumps. In addition, 150m away there is a gas station (cheap) and also a laundry room nearby. Highly recommended site."

The car park is slightly inclined and the only negative thing is that the point to empty the toilet is the same as where to get clean water, plus it has a grate that does not allow the toilet to drain easily."

13989,1111580,5,JoseAlias,03/11/2020,"Although there is nothing perfect in this life, for me the fact that a city council offers you an area adapted for AC overnight, with its completely free gray and black emptying area has all the gratitude on my part.

The pitches are falling to one side and we needed our chocks for the shower drain to work. Also everyone backs into their space for the overhang but they are setup to drive in. It was busy as some motorhomes had to park on the road. In the morning when motorhomes had gone cars would park in the spaces.

There are full free services. You have to drive out of the parking area to get there as it's in a separate area. There is a normal gray drain. The black WC drain is under a small manhole with the tap above it. The fresh water tap is in the corner with 2 tap connections. One is press button and the other is a screw-on connection.

Lidl and Mercadona are just around the corner. The main street is 5 minutes walk away. The castle is about 25 minutes walk away up a hill. There are plenty of cafes close by for chocolate and churros.

There are plenty of walks. The Camino from Malaga goes through here and that is well signposted with yellow arrows. We completed a 4 hour walk up to the hills with stunning views of the town. It went through the old textile area and is dirt road walking.

Cheap diesel (€1.15 when we were there) at Petroprix across from McDonald's."

The environment is beautiful, the entrance to the castle is 3 € and right now the path of the Friars is closed and the climb to the hermitage of Sta. Barbara for works. The Horta path of the castle-monastery is open. Access to the castle grounds is closed outside opening hours."
14014,777110,5,albert333,07/02/2020,"Lovely place, today the weather is perfect, only make sure your camper can make it up steep hills, about 3km of 6%/16% hill. view is great no one here just a owl to send you off to sleep."
14014,748915,4,Crachepot,01/12/2019,Perfect except we chose a night when the wind was howling. As the photos suggest you are parking on a ridge with little to hide behind!!
14014,738476,4,IDAM,04/11/2019,"Very quiet, only one car (from a non-noisy couple) visited the area at night. Spectacular views. Too bad for the wind that made it a bit difficult. It fills in the day after 10 in the morning."
14014,738473,4,IDAM,04/11/2019,"Quiet place to spend the night, just a couple of cars at night, couples, not noisy. Beautiful views. We caught a lot of wind and it made everything a little harder. Many people in the morning, but after 10."

14014,430665,4,Ricardsc,18/02/2019,"Simply highly recommended for those looking for tranquility, that if after dark because it is quite visited during the day, there is no service, let us all look at keeping it clean to enjoy spaces like this, I have been this Saturday with just another AC from the Netherlands"
14014,419652,4,lavero11,03/01/2019,Beautiful views of the sea. Visit the castle-monastery very well. Parking great for the night but it shakes well when the wind is strong.

14014,53138,5,catala,31/08/2015,Excellent place to stay overnight without feeling any noise. It is worth visiting the castle-monastery so that it is well preserved. Walking routes can be enjoyed enjoying spectacular views of the area. Excellent place to spend the night without knowing anything. He is interested in visiting the castle-monastery who is well preserved. You can probably do some promising deals with the imprevable south of the region.

14017,909079,1,circusfamilyontheroad,29/07/2020,Overnight is not allowed. The rural agents came and then the mossos de esquadra ... the neighbors seem not to appreciate motorhomes that spend the night there. Equally not worth it for the dust that gets up and for the noisy and few respectful kids who spend the whole night hanging around on the bike and bothering on purpose.
14017,420746,3,arete,06/01/2019,"We arrived late and spent the night, place for one night, surrounded by houses of an urbanization, some dog barking but trankilo place. At least that day."

14093,2595453,4,ColinandHelen,01/03/2023,This is indeed a great little campsite for small campers with great views and friendly staff.  When we visited there was no food available in the campsite and no one knew of any in the village but when we walked over we found the Maison d'Hotes was open and had a great conversation with the owner Malik who serves excellent food for a reasonable price. Recommended.

14093,2524705,5,InstantVanlife,19/12/2022,"The kind of place we particularly like, especially in this period, we are alone in the world. French is spoken, the setting is magnificent. The sanitary facilities are very acceptable. We stayed there for 2 nights. 4G full at Inwi. The perfect spot to rest. 1km of track just before but very passable. 1 pin and a nice climb at the end. But how happy you are."

On the other hand, fill up the fridge before arriving, there is no trade, the port, the beach, that's all. One toilet and one shower per sex, for ten pitches, that's enough"

14093,2204357,1,sultan123,09/08/2022,"Frankly, I advise against going to this camp for the following reasons: there is only one toilet for men, the quality of the toilets is very poor, the camp is located in a village which requires going there more than 3 km on an unpaved dirt road, the price of accommodation is high where we were asked. The charge is 100 dirhams without giving any receipts,"

Would not attempt in a large motor home. Site is also small and not suited for motor homes but cars and vans okay. Facilities basic but pleasant enough for me. Rashid is also very pleasant. Would stay again 100%

What about the inhabitants around the campsite? what to say about Flessal and his family?

14093,794312,3,isabo2020,11/03/2020,"Camping in a beautiful location on the cliff, shame about the very dirty beach.

14170,3158976,4,sarabara,16/08/2023,"Large area, with a service for emptying and filling water, a public bathroom that was out of order right now. The town is a minute walk away, passing the river you have a large park next to the Miño river. The only negative thing is that there is hardly any shade and that the train runs until midnight and then it starts to pass again at 7am."
14170,3126855,3,RaquelBarona,12/08/2023,"The excellent area near the park and the town but there is no one who sleeps the train passes every few until at least 12:30 at night and the first around 5:40 am and also noise from church bells and firecrackers of some kind party I guess. Anyway... everything else is great, especially the park that has mini golf, water jets for children, skate park..."
14170,3126000,5,AmadeuCampos,12/08/2023,"Great ! Close to the Park, River Minho, market and center!"

14170,3078504,1,ivanpinzales,05/08/2023,Impossible to sleep due to the celebration of the Vilanova festivities (2 - 6 August 2023). Loud music all night.
14170,3074286,4,taniafabiofata,04/08/2023,there is the San Sebastiano festival in progress. but you enter from two streets after. other campers present. quiet night even though the music went on well into the night. for loading and unloading we moved. too many in the area and limited in movement due to the temporary closure of 1 access. recommended for the presence of shops and the nearby center for a stroll and shopping.
14170,3069942,5,ferruntino,03/08/2023,"Perfect place to spend the night, fill and empty. Ideal for children. Crossing the road there is a space to enjoy water, museum, skatepark, minigolf... check the dates of the parties, as today for example you can't sleep because of the noise of the concerts and Dj."
14170,3047709,4,tiritos,30/07/2023,It is closed from 29/07 to 7/8. You can only empty water. Is there any parking outside the premises
14170,3045077,4,Pyros1976,30/07/2023,"Asphalt parking with water service, a very nice and large park to walk around, the town is close by. The downside is that a train passes from time to time and with a very beautiful river port, which is a bit dirty. I do not recommend bathing there and with bathrooms in the park"
14170,3015446,4,beccyanddan,24/07/2023,Very clean and lots of space. Toilets open overnight next to water park (follow path under railway line and to the left). Nice town with all amenities. But railway freight trains about 5am! Otherwise a peaceful place
14170,3001974,5,SergiioVillar,22/07/2023,"Good and quiet place, we arrived very late and we did not see what services it had, but it is fine to sleep, a train track passes nearby, but at night we only heard it once."
14170,2995501,5,sueandray,21/07/2023,"Good large space with services, stayed with about 20 other vans. Next to railway so some noise, but town is very pretty and beautifully decorated, and there is a superb park with children’s water area, cafe and biking path along river, which can be accessed via tunnel under railway line."

In July and August, the city is decorated with crochet works made by volunteers from the associated municipalities. The view from the highest point is magnificent. The ocean is 12 km away. Go see Manuela at the tourist office, she speaks French and she is adorable!"
14170,2806267,4,CarolinaCoelho,31/05/2023,"Parking and overnight stay allowed and free. The water and electricity services are very well located and very functional. The floor is fairly level. It has some shadows. Close to the train, but with rare passages and it doesn't bother you too much."

14170,2794339,3,hugo18,28/05/2023,"Good pitch in a nice little setting, park on the banks of the Minho. Unfortunately, you have the feeling of standing on platform 1 - but there are no trains at night."
14170,2780352,5,Velta90,23/05/2023,"perfect stop on the road from Portugal to Spain. Lots of places and plenty of space. very nice pleasant old town. can empty the toilet, gray water and refill water. A nice park on the other side of the railway. of course you can hear the train, but we thought it was just charming. we stood there among 30-40 other cars."
14170,2777493,5,ReinerReisdorf,22/05/2023,"Great place for large Womos, with supply and disposal. right next to the town and park on the border river. Train didn't bother us. Gladly again!"

Although the area itself only has 4 parking spaces, there is a parking lot right next to it where many motorhomes and campers spend the night without any problem. Very quiet place, although the train passes quite close and there is a church also nearby where the bells ring several times a day."
14170,2654659,5,JoseEduardoTeixeira,09/04/2023,The most welcoming village in Portugal. I love this town.
14170,2648377,5,vinckje,07/04/2023,"Arrived on Tue, April 4, '23 We had parked in the normal parking spaces. We were certainly not alone. On Wed evening/night the entire car park was packed Due to the Easter weekend it was very busy The village is very cozy and touristy We stayed 2 nights The train sometimes makes a lot of noise but it does not run at night The church tower is also heard . Not even at night"

14170,2600280,4,Amondsen,06/03/2023,About 40 WoMos were parked in the actual parking lot at the weekend. The reason was the big Saturday market with all sorts of everyday things from cooking pots to underwear to live chickens. But everything is relaxed and free of charge. City and park are also recommended.
14170,2591779,4,jbbernabe,26/02/2023,Delimited and leveled squares. Perfect for spending the night due to the feeling of security as there are many motorhomes. Silent night but soon the train and the cars on the road are heard. Recommended.
14170,2576437,4,VirginieEden,13/02/2023,"Great location, next to the city center and a long walk along the Minho. At least 40 CC but very quiet at night. A few trains pass during the day, at night flat calm. The services are very good. Free area, thanks to the municipality for this location."

14170,2561166,5,Gueko,26/01/2023,"The area as such has few spaces, but it is next to a very large car park and you can leave it there. Level, clean and quiet, except for the occasional train that goes by, but it is bearable. Close to the town and ideal for doing the Miño ecopista. The entire surrounding area is very beautiful and well-kept, next to the Miño. thanks for this site"

14170,2524214,4,emax88,18/12/2022,"Parking area with only 4 spaces, but the use of the adjacent parking is tolerated. In this period, with the town full of Christmas initiatives, the car park is overcrowded with campers who park you even a few cm next to you, it is certainly not the most peaceful night you can find but the town is worth a visit. Free and easy to use services"
14170,2520710,5,Josio,13/12/2022,Perfect place to park your motorhome.
14170,2520591,4,MonicaGarciaDiaz,12/12/2022,"Although it is located between the bus station and the railway line, there were no night noises. Next to it there is a very large parking lot that is where most of the motorhomes were. The navigator took us through a small tunnel through which we did not fit and we accessed from the train station. We only spent the night to go to La Guardia (it is very close, a good option if you want to visit Santa Tecla)"
14170,2515177,1,janneoobik,07/12/2022,Toilet just ate our coins and we could not use it. two coins on top of eachother.

14170,2508352,3,celiwak,28/11/2022,"Apart from the noise of the train and the bus station, this spot does its job for a quick overnight stopover. As a bonus, a great park by the river to walk the dog and a very pretty village.."

14170,2464546,3,HelmutMeyer,27/10/2022,"Thanks to the city of Vila Nova De Cerveira for this free accommodation, supply and disposal option. The parking space is very large and level, unfortunately you can hear the slow moving train at night."

14170,2320379,3,terminal15,30/08/2022,"It is what it is, a large safe car park. We spent one night here, train is loud but stops overnight."
14170,2314906,5,sterchi,28/08/2022,Good place to visit the city and the market. It officially only has 4 slots. Last night there were 65 RVs and a trailer in the lot. It has a public toilet (0.50€). The place is flat and quiet at night.
14170,2298517,4,crisanmar,25/08/2022,A good place to spend the night. Next to the center. The bad thing is that the train makes a lot of noise when it passes. For the all very good.

14170,2256753,5,Kepler0,17/08/2022,"Spectacular to go with children, you have an area with parks and games behind the train. It has a water play area. The town is beautiful and has very good bars, a supermarket and a Chinese. Also a spectacular bike path to ride. The only downside, the train passes nearby and you can hear it."
14170,2252022,5,VANNY114,16/08/2022,Cool. Good for the town. We arrived on a Friday and were able to park with no problems. On Saturday there is a huge market that is more than interesting. Good hotel offer and routes of all kinds. Worth.
14170,2245962,4,Kromoly,16/08/2022,We just did a water change. Only 1 position (correct) very requested: we had to queue after 4 AC and it took a while.
14170,2235119,5,FMFO,14/08/2022,"Beautiful stage. Very lively and interesting country! In addition to the space dedicated to motorhomes which is small, there is another large parking lot in front."

14170,2172271,4,chausson7,04/08/2022,"Good stop off. All water, waste and toilet facilities. Lots of kids activities just across the road, with swimming pool, water garden, park, crazy golf, restaurants and local shops just a short 5 minute walk. Felt secure."
14170,2145428,5,sabimenendez,30/07/2022,"Area with emptying and filling services. Parking in the area is few, but the adjoining car park is used, which is very good. Pity that some people do not respect and set up the beach bar in the middle of the parking lot. For children there is a park on the other side of the railway with water games in summer and a walk along the banks of the Miño. The town is very welcoming and has terraces in the church square."
14170,2133884,5,Gurifrisky,28/07/2022,"Good area, if we put a but it is because of the proximity of the train that makes noise. The town is beautiful and the walk along the river and all the activities are great to go with children"
14170,2099889,4,Mariomenendez,20/07/2022,Good place to spend the night. Some noise due to the proximity of the train. The town is very nice and cozy and with many hotels
14170,2085030,5,camperoff,17/07/2022,"Good views, flat ground, a lot of free space, interesting village where you can go out and grab some decent food. Also there is laundry in this village for fair prices. I think good place for 1-2 nights. Only 1 minus is TRAINS, I could hear one and then fall asleep, while my fiancée woke up 2 times during the night. So if you are noise sensitive be mindful, parking is just next to railway"
14170,2025606,4,Lemarelta,30/06/2022,"nice city. Large area with all services. The biggest problem is that next to the area there is a concert. Let's hope it doesn't last long. otherwise, the landscape offered by the park next to the river is spectacular"
14170,2011788,4,Ajjj,26/06/2022,"Arrived at 21:00 on a Saturday,  still enough space. Quiet, Safe and a cute little town to get a bite to eat. The parking itself hasn’t got any Charme therefor 4 stars ."

14170,1920999,4,jma12,27/05/2022,"The service area is free but its 4-space car park is too small and placed against the railway line. On the other hand, the parking lot next door was already hosting about twenty ccars when we arrived. It is flat and huge with some small shadows. Despite what has been said previously, the trains, which are rare, are not a problem, except perhaps for those who will stick against the track."
14170,1917284,4,1708,26/05/2022,Very good with all the services

14170,1852675,5,Benetille2012,25/04/2022,"Great spot to at least spend the day there with the kids. Free services, thanks to the town hall. The car park is nevertheless right next to a railway line so noisy but once an hour at most during the day."
14170,1849803,4,RamS.,24/04/2022,"Very large parking lot. Actually only 4 designated caravan spaces, but our large rear parking lot was also full. On Saturday there was a market in the town, which is highly recommended. We suspect that's why there were so many WoMos. We didn't need any services, but they were available. Thanks to the city! Train is very close, runs until about midnight."
14170,1835181,4,bertip,18/04/2022,"We have spent several nights on different trips and it is highly recommended. It is spacious and very close to the town, you can walk very quickly. It is also close to the river walk, great for cycling and a children's park. It is better not to be close to the road, but it is still very quiet and pleasant."
14170,1812771,4,Andrea-Dinis,10/04/2022,We only stop to empty and fill the AC and everything is correct.
14170,1799275,5,CINZIAontheROAD,28/03/2022,"Pitches not very large, if you fill the parking lot you have the neighbor very close ... area on asphalt and level. Anonymous but very quiet area and clear night. In a short time you arrive in the interesting area of the city and nearby there is an excellent place to drink and eat. Adequate unloading area. All free. Thanks joint !!!"
14170,1777862,4,Rasputin108,09/03/2022,"Visually certainly not a highlight, just a very large parking lot. But you are in the city in 2 minutes, the beautiful river bank or you can start a hike up to the deer statue from there. Service area was fully functional."
14170,1767683,2,xunpugnodieuro,27/02/2022,"Huge parking lot full of campers everywhere, shabby and with campers who are not very respectful of others, with engines running day and night to charge the batteries. It seems to be in a Roma camp. Free unloading and loading but water indicated as ""uncontrolled"". The only advantage is that it is adjacent to the town center. The disadvantage is the neighboring railway. If you love tranquility, avoid this place"

14170,1674898,5,Quicolas,02/11/2021,Magnificent wide flat animated the town and the eco-operator one step away. The sound of a train from time to time and the sensational weekly market. Cool and a lot
14170,1648707,4,alihase,17/10/2021,"Overall very large space; next to the actual parking space a large asphalt and next to it an unpaved parking lot; everything largely flat. Disposal and supply available, the toilet house (throw in 50 cents) defective, but toilet in the building next to it, but desolate and dirty. The town and the river are only a 5-minute walk away. Recommendation to stay overnight."
14170,1635325,5,RV-Harvey,09/10/2021,Turned up on Saturday and every entrance to the site was closed accept the final one through the car park. When we arrived we were told €10 to park by ladies at the entrance. Ignore them and drive on by. It's free and is good stop over with facilities. Seems acceptable to park over 4 spaces. We didn't.
14170,1612759,5,Nostramo,27/09/2021,"Large paved parking and little shade, the real area is next to the bus station. The train passes by, but that is a train, it is not a matter of making a drama for a train. In the month of June on the eve of the famous flea market it was completely full. Close to the center, nice town."
14170,1605117,2,camper4487,24/09/2021,"Okay for a night. Extremely loud train passing directly by. Toilets are 50 cents, but didn't open when inserting coins, even though they had a green light, indicating ""open""."
14170,1589077,4,Manu88,18/09/2021,"There are only 4 spaces, so we park in the esplanade that is attached, which is a normal parking lot. Despite the train, it is a quiet place and super close to the center. We did the night on a Friday and we took advantage of the fact that there is a huge market on Saturday. The tap is push-button, I suppose so that no one ""forgets"" to close it. We will be back for sure."
14170,1578976,5,KaneloAntonio,14/09/2021,Very good and central area with all services. Recommended Thanks to the City Council for such a good area
14170,1551530,4,LauraCfb,06/09/2021,"One of the best areas we found on our first trip, we stopped on the way out and back and even spent the day there. Tranquility, feeling of security because we had several Ac, plenty of space to not be stuck, downtown and a walk with a park 2 minutes away. The night bell does not ring. The train noise bearable. The road is already fenced"
14170,1549904,3,MIBR,05/09/2021,The place with many squares and good services. Next to the river Miño. The drawback is the noise of the train and bells as the rest of the opinions say and that yesterday the circus arrived and they were until very late moving commissions in the parking lot next door.
14170,1540246,3,hymer4family,02/09/2021,"Quiet place to spend a night, with all services in operation. The only repair for those most sensitive to noise is the fact that it is next to the railway. Very close to the village center with many good restaurants close by."
14170,1533004,5,AndreAraujo,31/08/2021,"Very good place, with a park right next door and right in the city centre. For families traveling with kids, it's worth it. Service area was very clean."
14170,1530071,2,laVicky,30/08/2021,"All good except for the big bottle and party that some teenagers had until 5 in the morning, with the music at full volume. The train is nothing next to that"
14170,1515208,5,MagdaEncarnacao,26/08/2021,"Services in good conditions, we emptied grey and black waters and refilled water for free."
14170,1515191,5,MagdaEncarnacao,26/08/2021,"Quiet place with good free services. Next to bars, parks and river. We highly recommend this place."

14170,1485877,5,Andrearod,20/08/2021,"The place is perfect to sleep, it is also close to the town that you can visit and has all the services. We also visited which is about 11 minutes to see the swing with a spectacular view. I recomend you"
14170,1485656,4,Beasty442,20/08/2021,The actual designated motorhome parking area is next to the parking lot by the service point and only has 4 large size places. We didn't notice the train during the night. There's no shade. The small trees in the parking area don't provide much shade either.
14170,1484584,4,Lunila,19/08/2021,"Free parking with water change services and toilet emptying. It is very large and spacious. Next to the town center, very cool, and a huge park with swings and plenty of room to walk along the river. The train passes by, but it is not very annoying. I wish more cities had places like this. I recommend it."
14170,1480866,5,MonicaVelasco,19/08/2021,Quiet parking although the spaces are narrow without going with AC. Public bathroom that charge 0.5 cents. The train passes by but you can hardly hear it. The church bells start to ring at 8 but nothing annoying. It is right next to what looks like the bus station.
14170,1468264,5,MargaridaMendes,16/08/2021,"Fantastic river beach, place with lots of activities to do. The campervan park is very close to everything and we can sleep there (super quiet night) It has a free water dump/supply service."

14170,1443572,3,Vikmek,12/08/2021,"Very large esplanade with very small trees that do not give too much shade. All in all, the place is perfect to visit the town or spend the day on the river. The trains begin to pass at 5 in the morning, with the consequent noise that a little later joins the church bells. Otherwise quite quiet and clean."
14170,1438437,4,Javi_Coyanza,11/08/2021,"Asphalt parking on the outskirts of town. Large and with many cars, which sometimes accumulates people who do not respect rest hours. Next to train tracks that also annoys rest. The beautiful and worth visiting town"
14170,1432791,4,titandluxe,10/08/2021,"Large area next to the town and a very attractive park for children, on the edge of the river. The train tracks are stuck and it passes several times a day. We didn't even know about it at night. I guess it depends on the dream of each one. It is true that the water has little pressure, but more than enough with a little patience. The services, correct and more to be free"
14170,1426387,4,marianxentecaos,09/08/2021,We were in this area only one night and did not use the services. Very spacious and close to the center of town. It is next to the train tracks so it is a bit annoying.
14170,1410576,5,Nusalvarez,05/08/2021,"Nice place, the parking lot is full of motorhomes. the town is pretty and has several bars with affordable prices. The park that surrounds the area is well cared for, it has a cycle path of several kilometers, a bathing area in the river quite close and free toilets in the town, the parking toilet costs 0.50 cents."
14170,1391728,4,Jesbert,01/08/2021,Stood there for one night with about 60 other campers. We felt safe and were able to visit the beautiful village right next door.
14170,1384298,4,Tinou44,30/07/2021,"There are a lot of places and this little town is really beautiful. Everything can be done on foot. There is also a nice park along the river right next to it. it is better to park towards the entrance rather than towards the train tracks to hear less trains. Fortunately, little goes on. It didn't bother me too much personally."
14170,1371158,2,Lolari,27/07/2021,"Parking space on a gravel parking lot, actually only 4 spaces, the adjacent tarred parking lot is used by many mobile homes. Free supply and disposal, very low water flow. The railway line is right next to it, trains clearly audible. Nearby is a small park with a playground and bike rental. Okay for one night, but nothing more."
14170,1321212,4,carlosmg,13/07/2021,"Good area, with space for everyone, we went on the day of the fair and there was room to spare. 1 minute from the town and a spectacular park. Thanks to the Vilanova town hall. It's a pleasure to spend money in towns like this."
14170,1307341,3,Vagabund_Rudi,09/07/2021,Large asphalt parking lot right at the center. There were a good 50 mobile homes. Good for one night. You shouldn't be bothered by the noise of the freight trains. There is enough space. You can come late too.
14170,1302673,4,Vitorjoao,07/07/2021,"A good park to stay overnight, without problems and with services, close to the center of the village. Thank you to the municipality"
14170,1297244,2,jennyjenn,04/07/2021,"Very good spot to visit this pretty little town! But I don't recommend sleeping if you are a light sleeper! We stayed one night and the bullet train next door passed at 5.30am, plus it honked as it passed and then a few trains followed after. Night not at the top. But if you are a heavy sleeper then this is a good spot lol."
14170,1283267,3,PinaColadaLiebe,28/06/2021,"Small, level & paved square across from a lively park (babble of voices, screeching, ball game noises, etc.) with very spacious parking spaces; many RVs park in the adjacent parking lot; every now and then, the stench from the service station drifts over; trains run several times a day (until midnight); but very quiet at night, then a bit restless again in the morning"
14170,1267202,4,hasenteufel,20/06/2021,Great little place and be sure to go to the small town with lots of local ones. we stood here with about 70 mobile homes.
14170,1263002,5,Mibcosta,18/06/2021,"Excellent parking, has all the structure for services (cleaning cassette and greywater, and clean water to add). Very close to the Historic Center."

14170,1247899,4,UrbietaMoni,11/06/2021,"We came with the van and managed to fill the shower with water. We spent the night very well, except that I was scared by the train."
14170,1239080,5,VitorC.,06/06/2021,"Great place, with all services. The only downside is that due to resolutions at night there were quite a lot of people."
14170,1234899,5,PolTxetxu,04/06/2021,"Comfortable area with a beautiful town and a river walk that is part of an Ecovía. Being an official area, you can sleep without problem."
14170,1120579,4,WhoaBlueBetty,10/12/2020,Spent a couple of nights here. Nice quiet spot (apart from the hourly train until 11pm). Well worth a wander into the town. Water filling/emptying services all in working order
14170,1111641,5,arturbey,03/11/2020,"Perfect, quiet at night."
14170,1106083,5,noaneal,26/10/2020,"We stood here with about 20 campers, safe location, train along the site, you can hear the bells of the church ring what we also found charming, facilities. Stayed on 26-10 with campervan"

14170,1069900,3,iriaxana,26/09/2020,"Little grace is the train that passes at 8 am (Spanish time) and has the detail of honking the horn as it passes! If you weren't awake because of the previous trains, you're already awake for sure! The area itself is fine, it is super large, with filling and emptying of water, the trees shyly begin to cast a couple of shadows and the center of town is literally two minutes away on foot. The very pretty town can be seen in a few minutes. Completely flat parking with space for a lot of people and vans."
14170,1065578,4,sosaw,23/09/2020,"Very good, the very nice little town, a cream cake and a natural juice for breakfast and start the trip, perfect and thank you very much for these spaces."

14170,1005605,4,wir-leben-mobil,26/08/2020,Generous illuminated parking lot with VE and garbage container. A short walk takes you to the lovely Vila Nova de Cerveira. Unfortunately a bit noisy due to the adjacent railway line. The first trains left during our stay in August 2020 from 5:30 a.m. We stayed here with about 25 other mobile homes.
14170,991525,4,manel21,22/08/2020,Good area with all services. It has many squares. The tap has a size that I think is not standard.
14170,961019,5,alves73,14/08/2020,"Very good overnight park, with free service area, close to the green area with extensive park for children and leisure by the river, the only drawback is the train line and the whistle between 6.30 am and 7 am. Dangerous in a way for children and adults to access the leisure park. Beautiful village of welcoming people .... I will return and recommend."
14170,955566,4,aldo60,12/08/2020,"Hello park4 users, I have been in Park for two days later too many people see that the school holidays are well deserved my there are still places, the city very pleasant and well decorated all the services on site thank you the city for home"

The services are all fully functional. Edited the place :)"
14170,781890,4,F.L.Ortiz,17/02/2020,They cut the water in the terminal. To fill the tank we use the water tap in the WC of the bus station. We stop the motorhome at the door and hook the hose without problems.

Unfortunately, the toilets did not work, but about 300 meters away there was another public alternative (free, but closed at night). Depending on the location on the pitch a little louder by the nearby railway line. Okay for one night."
14170,685701,5,DenBart,11/09/2019,Nice place to park with services and a great view of the mountains. Can be a little loud with the trains and trucks working but during the night it is relatively quite.
14170,661975,4,sandralek,27/08/2019,"The area itself has 5 seats and all services but right next to it there is a parking lot where you can park, if you arrive throughout the day they charge you € 5. Next to the old area, at the end of that area on Saturdays In the morning they set up a big market.

And I had to go around until I found access by the general. We are next to the train tracks (something already very common in the areas) The ACs area is for 5 cars shared with buses and trucks. To the side there is a large car park in which entry is allowed and overnight at the AC as well. As a curiosity on Saturdays they celebrate a very large market and charge € 5 for entrance to the area and parking. I called the local police to see if it was correct and they answered that only on Saturdays there is a charge (1 € cars, 5 € ACs. The filling and emptying of grays and blacks is excellent. Good area for children with playgrounds and jets of water and many bars where you can “hydrate” and eat something Laundry 24 hours a ten minutes."
14170,602523,5,Nuriardv,06/08/2019,"Very good stop. The park behind is spectacular for both children and adults. Watch out in August, there are several parties. Every Saturday there is a very famous street market"

If you are present on a Saturday, you will not forget the very extensive market, part of which adjoins the area.

I stayed for one night in what they call the ""adventure mode""... which is to say, the part of the site that a large camper cant access but is perfect for a 4x4.  No neighbours, no noise, just a peaceful night under the stars. Highly recommended."

Nice atmosphere and very quiet. There is a small shop and you can order bread in the morning. There is also a bar/café. Tip is to bring bicycles, because there is a distance to the nearest shop and the city with its range."

14309,2494643,3,fan4womo,13/11/2022,"Exactly as described in my previous comment. The pool is closed too early, extremely many unbearable flies, because of the fertilized fields next door! You can therefore hardly ever sit next to the car for more than a quarter of an hour. Restaurants/bar on the square also closed. Washing clothes is also no longer possible. That's why I drove earlier. The exit is super dangerous!"

Decent but tight pitches. Amenities are there. For a long stay it is a bit far from the city and the beach, but for a one night stopover the place is appropriate."

At night you rest, although you can hear noise from the road and at times also music. Beach 15 min. on foot, but part of the way goes through a narrow two-way road, so it is better to get around by bike or car. Good value for money."

Another camper only pointed this out to us the next day. At this point we were completely infested. caterpillar dermatitis. Red, itchy spots all over the body, conjunctivitis and everything that goes with it. Both persons, as well as our dog."

Bike rental 8€/d"
14386,2493360,1,Ena2,13/11/2022,"Appearances are deceptive! At first glance, the campsite looks very cute. But toilets and showers are dirty. Despite payment, there is neither soap nor toilet paper in the bathroom. Washing machine defective! In my opinion an absolute rip off. Never again! There are far better places close by."
14386,2492174,1,Skydicted,12/11/2022,its only about money there. unfriendly employees and dirty toilettes. Dont do it.
14386,2395284,1,Opeixe,22/09/2022,"The campsite is fine, we paid €24/night to park our van, without using any other service other than overnight. Loading/unloading clean/dirty water has an additional cost. Quiet site but I imagine that like the rest of the surrounding campsites. We definitely do not recommend it because of the above and because of the treatment received by the camping staff, who were not very friendly."
14386,2033686,1,NaiSaio,03/07/2022,We are not staying! Very unpleasant staff and they ask you to stay at least 2 nights. We asked to use the bathrooms and showers with the intention of paying and they flatly denied us.

Sanitary clean but no toilet paper, no hot water for washing your dishes, no washing machines. Partying young people. The ground you stand on is small and muddy (and they give the mud extra water every day…?). Far walk from the beach. Swimming pool and restaurant closed."

14386,1881246,3,latecoaire,10/05/2022,€36 per night out of season. No swimming pool no catering. Minimum 2 days!! I didn't stay there.
14386,1836708,3,RubenP,18/04/2022,"We were at Easter. The campsite is fine, perhaps the bad thing is that the plots are a bit small for motorhomes. What I did not like was the obligation of having to spend a minimum of two nights when those who go with shops do not, which seems discriminatory. The distance to the beach is along a road for a km or so but it can be done well. It's quiet and the staff is friendly."

14386,1752252,4,DeNiiiiiice,10/02/2022,We were happy with the place. Very familiar. Well sheltered from the wind. Clean. The staff helpful and super friendly. The distance to the beach can also be covered on foot and with a surfboard under your arm. A lot of effort is made to keep the place in good shape. Small drawback: not very flexible with the overnight price if you spontaneously extend your stay.
14386,1749968,1,lamasontheroad,07/02/2022,The pine processionary moth is distributed throughout the campsite. With small children playing on the ground it is impossible to be at the campsite. Dangerous for children and annoying for healthy adults because of constant itching. The boss of the campsite is super unfriendly and is mainly interested in financial gain
14386,1737460,4,Outbackers,20/01/2022,"We spent 3 nights here! Sanitary rooms clean, but you had to be lucky with the warm water. That doesn't always work. The place is clear and the pitches are large enough. 10 minutes walk to the beach."

18 Euros for 2 pax and the Van (low season)"
14386,1634548,5,baerolex,09/10/2021,It is a nice camping site for have some surf at sea. 1km from the beach. Everything was clean but don’t forget to bring your own toilet paper. Is was 20€ for a van und 2 Pax.
14386,1633868,3,Belen03,08/10/2021,"Small pitches, the staff very slow attentive and the older man at the entrance a bit edge with respect to the animals.

14386,1372578,1,igor1,27/07/2021,"A shame. the manager with insults towards the clients several clients complaining about the spaces, they are tiny and they take advantage of the vans to assign large places and charge more. Lots of cats and RATS around garbage and employees without masks. a shame I do not know how it is full ... it will be because there is no more"
14386,1372407,1,leiremat,27/07/2021,"A shame! Treatment of the horrible manager. Not only were we not given the option of a small plot, but after insisting that we wanted a small plot they told us that our ducato did not fit. To our surprise, after a while, he parks a van identical to ours in a small plot and 5 cm from our awning. They take advantage of the fact that there are no more options in the area"
14386,1273866,4,Sommersonnenwende,24/06/2021,"Nice campsite with very friendly staff. However, the plots are very tightly divided so that when the campsite is full, there is little space available for the campers. Pool and sanitary facilities were clean and relatively new. Basically a fun place! Nice (glamping) tents that can also be rented."
14386,1154441,3,vitvalka,20/03/2021,Nice campsite. We didn’t stay as for us the price in off season was a little high: €32.30 for family of 4 and electricity if paid in cash. Pool and restaurant closed in march.
14386,1069239,2,jopogom,25/09/2020,"The campsite looks nice, but parts of the sanitary rooms, the pool and the meadow, as well as the supermarket and restaurant were completely or partially closed and still they wanted € 27 / night. We didn't stay there, we went to the next campsite."
14386,1047835,2,CrisyDavid,14/09/2020,"The campsite is fine and the bathrooms are very clean, but they have several roosters that start crowing at 4.30 in the morning and don't stop all night, so it's impossible to sleep. I do not recommend it at all for this reason."
14386,997035,2,GeorgeSoff,24/08/2020,"Plots 60m2 € 48 and 30m2 for € 24 gave us a space next to the bathrooms with the consequent movement of people through our plot, in addition to barely entering the van and a table. It is very crowded and there are cars badly separated everywhere (I couldn't get in and out of the plot with a 4.89m long T5 ... I had to ask for the cars to be moved) good pool and clean bathrooms although scarce"
14386,942533,4,pgarrido,09/08/2020,"We have been there for 5 days because it was impossible to park on the beach (they also get a fine). The palm grove is too crowded, I would choose another destination. The camping is very good if you get a shady area. The bad thing is that there are few bathrooms and showers (3 of each) because there are some closed (Covid) but it is nice, it has a swimming pool, a shop and a restaurant. You get to the beach on foot in 10 minutes"

14386,766441,2,Staceo,09/01/2020,Expensive out of season (€19 van and no electric) and you have to pay €10 deposit for a gate fob - cash! Card not accepted for 1 night stay. Lots of cats and bins overflowing with rubbish. Old cards not removed from pitches so you don’t know which ones are in use or free. Shower building is pretty but toilets dark. Beach a 15 min walk away. Ideal to stop here to avoid getting moved on from beach carpark.
14386,765325,4,Mare07,06/01/2020,"A really nice place for the low season! Pretty and clean moorish style wash house. Well protected by hedge and gate. Many surfers, the sea is 900m straight, absolutely feasible with the surfboard, therefore recommended for a surfing holiday."
14386,762986,1,martienuh,03/01/2020,"This could be a very nice camping place, but it’s not well maintained. The services for camper vans are really poor.

14386,562881,3,2busyclimbing,19/07/2019,"Stayed two nights.  Staff was friendly and the bathrooms and showers were acceptable.  We had extremely loud neighbors who were up past 1 am blasting music with kids running around screaming while we have a young child.  Swimming pool is alright but not very child friendly.  Was not close to the beach!  About a kilometer on a road that has no side walk which was dangerous with our child.  Also the portable water is not easily accessed, it is a small drinking fountain.  The water that is set up with a house is not drinkable!  A decent place to stay depending mostly on where you parcel is located"
14386,548115,1,Yanik,11/07/2019,Disorganized / disinterested no good location and land very small (30m2) sanitary clean Price is acceptable even in high season (26 € camper 2persons)
14386,457659,3,MelanieSuarez,17/04/2019,"Camping with all the amenities, the only downside that as of Easter Week do not accept pets. It is 10 minutes from the beach walking. recommendable"
14386,431270,4,DOMS2474,19/02/2019,"I was initially deterred by the bad comments, but can not confirm this: the campsite is about 1 kilometer from the beautiful beach, the toilets are very clean and well maintained and the price is in comparison perfectly fine (about 20 € per night for campers without electricity / 2 persons).

14386,98994,1,lbrinas7,23/08/2016,"Located in the middle of nowhere, very expensive because 49 euros for a mediocre pool does not deserve"
14386,47188,1,bluebuss,08/08/2015,Camping very expensive 40 € per night to 2 with a camper electricity included (we can not not take it). Rather noisy and poorly maintained sanitary but strong point: at the edge of the beautiful beach of Cape Trafalgar. The other two neighboring campsites are at the same rate. Activities and restaurants nearby.

14404,799732,5,quiqueagrelo,26/04/2020,Quiet open parking at meter price. Some noise from traffic. Very close to the center. There is no service.

14404,774343,1,Laurilla84,30/01/2020,"Today we have tried to park in that parking lot and it has been impossible, since there is no place for the motorhome in any place, it stands out very much towards the lane since they have put some fences so as not to invade the area under the trees."
14404,756356,4,owdshoo,23/12/2019,Very central. There's road noise but not too bad. It's used as a car park so it's pot luck who else is using it in terms of noise and what time they return to their car etc. The car parking machine wouldn't take any of our uk cards and will only take the exact change. Also you need to enter your car registration.
14404,752774,4,Paichi,11/12/2019,"Given the dates, we are barely 2 vans and few cars. We arrived at 6 in the afternoon and there were enough free places. The idea is to sleep and visit the city in the morning, eat something, and continue traveling. It is central, so the location is ideal, even though the road is near there is some car noise. Pass the river to the side, it is very cold. If you don't have heat, you may go cold"
14404,750679,2,JuliaEtaMikel,06/12/2019,"Parking for cars but we are motor homes and vans. Very close to the center, ideal for visiting Burgos. It is next to a bike path and the river. There are parking meters on weekdays and Saturdays in the morning, maximum 2 hours / € 2.40, and can be paid with the mobile. At night, noise of the machines that clean the floor and cars with music giving accelerations."
14404,735425,5,goribf6,01/11/2019,"We park to visit Burgos, very central, 5 minutes walk from the cathedral. There is a parking meter but it is worth it because of its proximity. Very sure. recommendable"

14404,403135,3,Ruby2016,02/11/2018,Free on Bank Holidays. We used it on 1st November and did not pay. Downside was everyone had parked so badly knowing there would be no fines that day that there was hardly any room left to manoeuvre.
14404,385973,2,mikeincuxac,01/10/2018,Free parking overnight but charged during the day. Maximum stay two hours so do not turn up before 8pm unless you are willing to pay.
14404,362162,4,Vilma,01/09/2018,"Good place, central and safe. The payment should be done with the app of my parking to renew every two hours. The bad thing is that the minimum is 10 euros to put in the app. Free from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. and from 8:00 p.m. Saturdays from 2pm and whole Sunday."
14404,343241,5,Smuthaus,19/08/2018,Top place to visit Burgos. On foot you are in 10 minutes in the old town. There are no parking fees on Sundays. We felt very safe.

14404,300049,4,carlosblay,25/07/2018,"Good site, 3 min from the evolution museum and 10 from the Plaza Mayor, ideal to get to know the historical center on foot. Well leveled, quiet (traffic does not bother), no services. The only drawback is that in the hours of payment does not admit tickets for more than two hours."
14404,287545,4,titomon,13/07/2018,"Squares somewhat narrow, but the location is perfect to get to know the city. I recommend installing the application for the payment of parking, it is more comfortable. By the way, my vehicle measures 7.30m and excels the length of the square, but does not bother others."
14404,268180,5,SDH,14/06/2018,We spent one night and very well. It was saturday and there was a bit of a fuss until 11pm and at 6am of the party girls. but they only passed by there. They did not stay. Very good location and perfect for a night in Burgos

14404,124024,2,xuandelaxata,25/03/2017,"The parking lot is divided into two parts, on the right are the many hikers' buses. On the left you can park the caravan, although the place is scarce and it is convenient to arrive early. It has no services, but it is cheap and very well located. Can not fit caravans of more than seven meters."

14404,73666,4,jeanot13,17/05/2016,Well located near the historic center. Too bad we can pay only 2 hours of parking because the city requires more time to visit its monuments and forced to return pay extra time. Otherwise very good.
14404,44237,3,michele6966,26/07/2015,Paid parking € 1.40 per 120 min. You could find it full of cars. Near the center you can spend the night.

The people who live around you will appreciate it."
14408,2465021,3,JCBOI,27/10/2022,"To top up water and drain gray or black water ok. To sleep rather take the other free parking space nearby. In the middle of a residential area on the side of a street. Anyway, thank you to the community!"
14408,2424157,2,henkenelise,05/10/2022,"It is a good location to empty the toilet and fill clean water. It is nice of the municipality to make something of it really. The location is also quite central, which is of course an advantage, but it is not really nice between the apartment buildings. There are only 3 reserved parking spaces for motorhomes along the side of a road. Not recommended for overnight stay."
14408,2281977,4,Catalega,21/08/2022,"Service point for filling clean water and emptying both gray and black water. Simple but comfortable and clean. Two places to park and spend the night.

Right next to it, there is a large public space: barbecues and picnics, a pleasant restaurant and a small river to cool off in. Vicente welcomes you with sympathy and also our Belgian neighbors I recommend this campsite"
14409,2415937,1,xento,01/10/2022,"Be careful, if you go out later than 12, they charge you the whole day, either 1 or 2, it seems like a robbery to me, since normally in another place they charge you noon, which I see as normal, but not the whole day"
14409,2359180,1,ReinhardKrix,10/09/2022,"We were there today, September 10th, 2022 at 4:15 p.m. No person on site. The square has 4 gates. All are open until 5 p.m. No one reached the phone numbers.

There are more and better facilities and that has ensured that the price has tripled from € 5 to € 15. A nice village stop for one or two nights but not for us anymore. Price per month is very cheap, 120€!!!"
14409,1713060,4,MrTransporter,20/12/2021,"Extremely quiet place with nice, large parking spaces. Electricity and very good internet are included at a price of 15 euros per night. The sanitary facilities are clean but small, 2x toilet 1x shower. If the space is very busy, I imagine this to be problematic. The place is neat and quiet. The ringing of the bells of the local church is very audible, but only disturbs if you are lightly asleep."
14409,1709556,5,parkhymervan,13/12/2021,"We have been here for 2 days now and have booked for 1 month. We were looking for a place of silence and found it here.

14409,1704789,4,Razor550,06/12/2021,"Great, flat site with many entrances and exits, making it easy to get around. Beautiful countryside and walks to explore. Easy to walk to the local village, 5 mins or Albaida 30 mins. Bikes also for hire. They’re just finishing a new shower and toilet block on the upper parking, will be great when done. Helpful chap who showed us around. Ozono restaurant highly recommended for lunch!"

To all this, 9:50 p.m. with a curfew at 10 p.m. That is, with the door in your face."
14409,1143510,5,carloslapuente,27/02/2021,"We have loved the place, very quiet, clean and with good treatment. The town is very beautiful to visit and very accessible to routes for children. Close to carricola, a town with a lot of charm."
14409,1117953,3,autorimor,27/11/2020,"You have to call the phone that is at the door so that they come from the town hall to collect and give you the command. € 7 the plot with water included. Toilets with hydroalcohol and paper and clean. The main problem is that the town's bell tower rings every half hour. It was difficult to sleep because it was soooo heard. Nearby there is a bakery, and the camping restaurant was open"
14409,1116759,5,helfra,21/11/2020,"We visited this site beginning noviembre 2020.

The Spanish campers, who certainly are not part of the upper class, make an effort to create a permanent noise level. This works brilliantly through loud arguing, childish screaming and dog barking. Soaking in the toilets seems to be her second hobby."
14409,376135,5,Allegria,17/09/2018,"A small family campsite that has everything you need. Very friendly welcome and helpful. Will spend a week here, lots of nature and tranquility.

14417,759860,1,patxoneta,30/12/2019,"Parking very well located to see the town, with beautiful views of the estuary. It is a pity that some subnormal ones are dedicated to throwing stones at the motorhomes, inviting us to leave there. A pity, we will not return"
14417,751941,5,CuniOrge,09/12/2019,"I've been the night of December 6th. The parking has great access, there are many places (we agree about six, you enter ACs and vans. No tourism) I can not understand the comments read here that the town has nothing to do. The walk to the lighthouse of Pancha Island is amazing! On the dates we were there was a great atmosphere. We loved it"

14417,705394,5,rochider,26/09/2019,"Good place to pecnoctar not even a fly can be heard and the town is 100 meters large, bearing a lift, the truth is that the town has little to see"

There is a route from there to a lighthouse (about 3kms) that is worth it (by the way, to highlight a recreational area for dogs with grass and some stairs so that the kennels can go down to the water.) On the route to the lighthouse at 1,5km approx of the parking."
14417,295378,4,danielleg,21/07/2018,"Really quiet, safe with other campers around us. On the water, viewing the industrial marina. Close walk to restaurants but unfortunately no toilet or water access. Safe + peaceful, plenty of space."

14418,384980,4,girao,30/09/2018,Thanks to Eroski for providing the water service and emptying completely free we have made a good purchase for our pantry. A good and intelligent example that many should apply.
14418,182264,4,dasuzu,22/08/2017,This place does exist and is a service area next to the Eroski supermarket petrol station so cheap diesel too :) Its not just a car park. Only fault is single push button tap so worth spraying with disinfectant as the usual people will put the rap inside the funnel of their WC cassette and no hose connection possible so need a watering can.
14418,168857,4,padresporprimeravez,08/08/2017,The gray and black water filling and emptying service is now operational again.

14418,103098,5,vinya,05/09/2016,Very well. We only use it for filling and emptying water. But there are super of different houses. Also two gas stations. Recommended to buy food and refuel water and diesel. We must congratulate this type of facilities (the shops and us win)
14418,90539,3,belengp,07/08/2016,Sewage can not be damaged and closed.

14418,54650,5,Monrepos,12/09/2015,On Eroski parking. Filling and emptying area very easy to access and well defined. Drain and refill free waters. Possibility of spending the night. Cafeteria. Thanks Eroski
14418,47009,3,eduvipa,07/08/2015,"Area in front of the two supermarkets Eroski and Lidl, is a commercial center with two gas stations, has free water and emptying of gray and black water, ideal for the night, very large parking a kilometer from the town center"

14419,3244302,5,Toagla,01/09/2023,"We parked to see the town. Wide and level. Please do not remove tables, chairs, awnings... So we can continue enjoying."
14419,3211021,2,AnaOrtega,24/08/2023,It is not a pretty place at all. Very narrow places. It does not differentiate cars and ACs. In the same center .. yes.
14419,3197760,4,RocioHenarejos,22/08/2023,"Good place to park with spectacular views, five minutes from the town center and the museum of the mills. You can reach the entrance of the town immediately and without problem. However, to rest during the day it is not recommended, there is a sports center next to the parking lot and there is a lot of noise."
14419,3182522,2,manu40220,19/08/2023,"for parking no more, not suitable for long cc"
14419,3138402,2,igone32,13/08/2023,"I give it 2 stars because it is not exclusively for buses and it was full of cars parked on the corners... well located to visit the town. Be careful! It is a parking lot with no exit and with bad access and no option to maneuver if there are cars parked. We have seen them difficult with a 7-meter bus and a bike rack. There was no room, go back and wait for the movies in 2 cars that prevented the exit ... an odyssey .."
14419,3118803,3,neusbg3,10/08/2023,"We spent one night in this car park, there were cars parked and it was full, we found a place by miracle. The squares are very close together but we spent a very quiet night. The site is within the town, to visit it and start routes from there it is recommended. The environment is fine, but it is not a place with great scenery. We recommend it if you want to be close to Taramundi."
14419,3077411,4,arboldelevas,04/08/2023,"Perfect area to visit the entire valley. Space is tight. Mine is 7.5 MTS and it was difficult for me to maneuver. There is no emptying of sewage. Only filling and emptying of gray water. I could not use it, there was a motorhome parked in the area. Beware of the cars that park next to each other and there is no way out. But anyway thanks to Taramundi for enabling this and the one above"
14419,3033454,3,aplikacion,28/07/2023,"Good area to spend the night, but being shared with cars, the water area is blocked by parked cars. We have done the Os Teixois excursion and when we returned at 4:00 p.m. we had problems getting the motorhome out."
14419,3031610,4,ReneMartinez,27/07/2023,"A few slopes, but absolute tranquility, and 400 meters from the water mills museum, fantastic and wonderful if you go with children, you can touch everything"

14419,2911803,4,Volvero,01/07/2023,"It meets expectations, very quiet and peaceful to spend the night, simple but functional water point."
14419,2687515,4,Alzu,22/04/2023,"We stayed two nights, the first alone and the second with another motorhome, the site is calm and quiet, we didn't get to use the emptying area, only one drawback, if the motorhome is large it may have problems maneuvering, ours is 6 meters and we did not have them. Thank you Taramundi for remembering us"
14419,2674803,4,Frangel,16/04/2023,"almost in the center of Taramundi, all good, if anything, the road is a bit narrow to get there. Quiet and flat."
14419,2647134,1,Kasku51,07/04/2023,With a large motorhome it is crazy. The cars park as they want and leave you locked up. Today at noon it would be literally impossible to get out because they have parked next to the wooden fence.
14419,2644993,4,furgofamilysantander,06/04/2023,"We have spent one night and the truth is that we were a few Ac and camper and it has been very quiet. In the morning everything gets more complicated when all kinds of vehicles park and the space is reduced, nothing that can't be solved but it must be taken into account. Very well located. To say that on Friday, April 7, 2023, you will see the Cheese Fair and on the night of Saturday, April 8, 2023, they have prohibited parking."
14419,2624979,5,vwt46,26/03/2023,super quiet place to sleep and with what is necessary for loading and unloading very comfortable to know the town
14419,2562665,1,carlos110978,28/01/2023,Bad access. Just right for camping. Tourism places. Poor water and discharge services
14419,2463017,4,VivianaCld,26/10/2022,"We have spent the night here alone. No noise was heard and the site is very comfortable. There is a little unevenness in the parking lot, but it does not bother. In the same place the water can be unloaded and filled. The only negative point is that out of season you can't find anywhere to dine, the restaurants close the kitchen. The car park is ideal for doing the water route. Incredible views."
14419,2452237,5,DANECA,19/10/2022,"I give it 5 stars because the town is beautiful, I recommend going to see the museum of the water mills, the parking lot is not bad at all, but be careful with ACs of more than 7 meters because there are very, very narrow streets and turns . we did not spend the night"
14419,2426698,1,Anus,06/10/2022,"Shared parking with cars, very small spaces for the AC, the entrance is a bit difficult for an AC of 7.50 like mine, and the exit is worse, since you have to go down a street with a slope of 12% approx. , and then climb another with the same slope, a horror. The town does not have any charm, although it is in a beautiful valley."
14419,2410961,5,VictorSeijo,29/09/2022,We spent 2 nights. Quiet and perfect place to visit the town and surroundings.
14419,2404192,4,rosaamarilla,26/09/2022,"Quiet area, not as complicated as they paint it... we had 8 cars spending the night... very nice little town."
14419,2337931,3,eit026,04/09/2022,"Parking in the center of town. Getting there is easy, but at the entrance to the car park there are some trees that can rub against the roof/sides. We had no problem parking our 6.5 meter AC, but as other people say, it depends on the vehicles that are parked it can be more difficult. Beware of cars that park very close, as they won't let you maneuver afterwards."
14419,2330240,3,jjlazo79,02/09/2022,"Shared spaces with cars. Very very fair to maneuver with ACs of more than 6m if there are few free spaces. Cars also park in the emptying area at times. The indoor sports center echoes a lot and amplifies any noise inside (balls hit, shouting, etc.) Little mobile coverage for teleworking. The town and its routes are charming."
14419,2308488,4,RV3,27/08/2022,"A very busy area but central to visit the town, comfortable for vehicles no more than 6m and quiet to sleep thanks to this area."
14419,2287441,5,puentiss,22/08/2022,"It is a great place and in the village. To maneuver if the ac is large, and there are several parked, it is complicated... water emptying and filling service. It is a quiet place, without a light, you hear the cow bells and wild boars at night. Before reaching the town there is another space where I saw two parked cars, but this one is in the center. Recommended pizza and freixole shop nearby"
14419,2255467,5,MaxLittleValley,17/08/2022,"we spent the night with large acs and we were very calm, the place was great !!!! a success and the Taramundi area is beautiful. It is true that for very large ACS it can be more complicated to maneuver"
14419,2203439,1,alexyanezdelacal,09/08/2022,"Parking for cars and for AC, most are cars and more in summer, with little space to maneuver and less to move, noise from early morning and services are very deteriorated."
14419,2193114,3,unbalconnoche,07/08/2022,"It really is a car park where cars also park, short and narrow spaces, if it is very full it is difficult to maneuver with an ac of more than 6 meters. The good news is that it is in the town, it is quiet and has all the services, the emptying of black is a chest on the ground marked."
14419,2176346,5,Minotavrvs,04/08/2022,"Great to spend the night and for a change of waters. Although it is shared with cars we had no problems with AC of 7 m nasturtium. It is recommended to be in OS Teixois first thing in the morning so as not to have access problems due to the size of the AC (it was rightly recommended to us by the Tourist Office). For Mazono, you can leave it at the siding that there is from Teixois almost in the town, on the left hand side just before of the water route."
14419,2147567,3,Toja22,30/07/2022,"Very good for visiting the small village.
Everything work and is quiet. 
There were other 4 campers and some cars.
However,big campers won't fit unless parked horizontally."
14419,2119936,3,copicombois,25/07/2022,"Parking too narrow and small for AC. We with a GV van had some maneuvering problems, although in the end we parked. The town is pretty. Shared parking means that most users are cars. There is no shade so we just spent the day."
14419,2113598,5,Jayla,23/07/2022,"Quiet night, in the center of town, free wifi and free water service. The plots are small, there is not much room for maneuver but with care there are no problems."
14419,2089177,1,rafaydana,18/07/2022,It's a dead end trap. Only for campers and motorhomes of 6-6'50 meters.

After 2 tries we left the village which was crawling with disrespectful tourists (crossing the street at all times without looking at the traffic just to take a picture). Warning! Do not go down to Os Teixois without having booked beforehand, and prefer the road on foot (complicated for the descent and the maneuver at the bottom of the valley)."

14419,1437090,3,luishack2,10/08/2021,It's too narrow for 7 meter AC. very difficult to park and difficult to get out if you have another AC next door. water discharge is also quite inaccessible for large ACs. It should prohibit parking cars.

It is seen that it is not very visible because I saw another user emptying the drinking water into the grate and I had to explain to him, the poor man apologized embarrassed."
14419,1394917,3,AnaIsabel226,02/08/2021,"The place is not bad, but it has two drawbacks: it is shared with cars that park too close to the ACs (and other ACs do it too) and that the unloading area is not marked or painted so that you do not park, which also maneuver is difficult. Otherwise it is a great place. EYE! There is no drain for sewage."

In this parking lot you find it hidden from the world, at night it is quiet, it is fine for vans but for motorhomes if one is stuck next to you you will not get out since you have a guardrail in front to turn, do not leave without visiting the mill, it is spectacular.."

14419,1164561,4,DavidFlo,03/04/2021,"As they say it is narrow and there is only one tap in the service area. There was a container right on the entrance road, 20 meters away. The location is good. There was a car at the beginning of the parking lots. Some cars were on normal battery and others on oblique. The space of the service area is not delimited. Perhaps if the lines were painted it would help to organize their use."

Very good bread in the village. Let's visit Mazonovo and its museum, Os Teixois and its museum, Esquíos, Pardiñas and its museum. The routes we did were the water and the blacksmiths."

One of them, who doesn't sell to stores and gives you a free demonstration, Antonio Díaz... going down the stairs of the car park 500m to the left. I recommend it 100%."
14419,1076522,4,Rossemary,30/09/2020,"Very precarious services. Warning, the only faucet gets caught spewing water, so you have to pull hard out. Very short spaces and regular access. When it is full it is difficult to maneuver. According to the merchants, both they and the mayor are committed to motorhomes and do not rule out a better area. I guess that is so, since we are a great source of their income."

14419,1001802,3,Kirabonita55555,25/08/2020,It is appreciated that the Taramundi City Council considers the ac. The place is a little narrow to access the parking spaces. The views are very beautiful.

14419,990731,3,hymercamp,22/08/2020,Small area and not easy to turn around. very calm. the loading and unloading area sometimes occupied by cars. The cemetery parking lot does not have services but is larger and has a playground next to it.

14419,967600,2,anajimenez,15/08/2020,The area is not worth it because cars also park and it is very tight to empty and collect water. Better to park in the cemetery parking lot
14419,966778,1,LauraMartin,15/08/2020,"Although it is appreciated that the municipalities include areas for AC in their projects, the one in Taramundi did not succeed with the location. Too narrow to maneuver, as well as being shared with a car park. The access and exit road is a bottleneck where it is difficult if you meet another AC in the opposite direction. I do not recommend it."
14419,962355,1,Isabelina,14/08/2020,"Disgusting, we couldn't flush because the drain was already overflowing. Bad to maneuver, only for campers and cars. If you have AC, go, bad input and bad output."

14419,950535,2,rreebbe,11/08/2020,"On the signs it says AC parking but there everyone passes it through ... too narrow to maneuver we had a terrible time since the cars park where they want and do not allow the AC, a very very difficult area. The only good thing, although quite improvable, is that there is free emptying and filling, as long as you have space to do it, why do not park any car in the hole if you do not give up for screwed up! We just stop to see the town and eat!"
14419,946284,3,LoveLiberte,10/08/2020,Parking spaces but you can park if there are not too many. Improved emptying area but it serves its function. Very cool cider house. Spectacular routes!
14419,933573,3,jorh,06/08/2020,"Ufff, for large motorhomes it is difficult to maneuver if you have cars or campers parked next to it, I had to talk to my neighbors, so that if necessary they would move the Campers for me to be able to take out the motorhome, service area at the end, although later I didn't have them You have to ask for help, the town is very beautiful and the routes are very good, for children the museum is highly recommended"
14419,929292,3,galgoneta,04/08/2020,"Area behind the sports center. The initiative is good for AC's. A little fair for the big ones, since if they park they are very in the middle and the others have a difficult time getting to the services which is at the end of everything, impossible to turn around if they park AC's towards the end. The gray water emptying plate is very small for some motorhomes, it almost comes out, we have had to cut out a water bottle to channel the water into the plate. They could have made a manhole or something to empty the toilet. We haven't spent the night but it seems very quiet. Is free. Thanks to the Taramundi people?"
14419,928660,4,juntxu,04/08/2020,Good place to park and start the route or take a walk around the town. It can be a bit tight to get out of if you go with a motorhome. emptying service and a fountain.
14419,927974,3,Enfelen,04/08/2020,"I forgot... When you leave the area the arrow tells you the obligatory left and the GPS tells you right... We paid attention to the arrow and we had a hard time passing the first area through parked cars and in the second section two houses are quite narrow... We pass 1cm on each side of the mirror, you have to have enough hand to pass through there... We wear a full Nevis"

14419,910902,3,elenaordo,29/07/2020,"Well located in the town but narrow and shared with cars. During the day we found that several cars had parked on top of the garbage dump and we could not access it. Currently due to Covid, the toilets are closed"
14419,887215,3,Argiz,21/07/2020,"Quiet place, but they should better signpost the emptying of fecal matter, rather than raising a manhole cover next to the emptying of gray matter. People get confused and empty their feces on top of the gray grid. thanks to the city council for this area of ac"
14419,851744,5,RojAleo,06/07/2020,"Great place. We spent a quiet night. There is a water drain and a water source. The place is wonderful with beautiful views. Next to the old town and the beginning of the water route, a more recommended route that takes you through nature and through the villages. Taramundi is magical."
14419,661691,4,dani3lin,26/08/2019,"area for ac not very long, difficult to maneuver. the parking is mixed, so many cars can occupy the seats. It is advisable to eat at the bar that is just outside, a cider house."
14419,640013,1,Elmadair,18/08/2019,"You are lucky if you come to empty dirty water and fill and have not parked cars in the water drain as has happened to us. Narrow area, very difficult to maneuver if full."
14419,629190,3,timonel,14/08/2019,The site is nice but difficult to maneuver for large AC. They also park cars that make maneuvering difficult. We had to travel the entire area in reverse to empty.
14419,625292,4,Relizard,13/08/2019,"Very nice village. If you are traveling with children it is worth visiting the mill museum. Maneuver tight but not impossible, too bad they park cars."

Right next to village and Information office, plus main walking routes to other nearby villages."
14419,441892,3,Chiki84,19/03/2019,"Quiet place with flat squares. Better for vans than for large motorhomes, they may have trouble maneuvering. Enlightenment enough to see what is right and to dominate well. They should clean the water drain."

A message was constantly going out on my cell phone and no one answered. We were knocking on the door and Nadir answered. A terrible treatment to the client having the area working.

14425,1239879,2,Quicolas,06/06/2021,"Difficult access because there is always some insensitive and unsupportive smart guy who parks his car as he pleases. Small squares and there are always stories in the surroundings, in this case a grocery store and some tents. They were also under construction. Pena because the town is cool and there are some interesting routes around. Anyway...."
14425,1184069,3,claudia88due,02/05/2021,"Well located, near the center of Vegadeo. The squares somewhat short."

14425,1133065,3,marsuma7,25/01/2021,"In the center of town, behind the fairgrounds. The spaces reserved for Ac, in a small parking area, are short, poorly designed space. You can park in the large annexed car park, except on Saturdays, when they have a flea market. Inadequate access by narrow street, there are usually cars that make it difficult for large vehicles to pass. Correct services. Quiet and safe place."
14425,1032890,4,rocofurgo,07/09/2020,"Well located, near the center, with a Día supermarket a few meters away. just say you have to wear a clamp for the tap, otherwise fine."

14425,875381,3,Eduardomsmf,17/07/2020,"Area with all services (loading and unloading of gray and black water). The downside is the fill faucet which is fountain and threadless.

If I have to put a but is that the restaurant (which does not depend on the campsite) has abusive prices. €3 for a juice or €3.80 for a croissant."

Overcrowded, crowded and slightly uneven, if you are looking for tranquility it is not here, if you have children it is ideal. Very old toilets. If you are lucky enough to be on the first line you will enjoy good views and an incredible sunset. Direct access to the rocky coast where you can enjoy the views, crashing waves and tranquility. Wind blows to give away"
14452,3095155,2,aketza,07/08/2023,"Good campsite to watch the sunset, it's very windy and the pool is a bit cold, they gave half of our plot to another person and we had to complain at reception, and also comment that the head of security was walking around at 12 o'clock the night with a flashlight looking who was plugged into the current and who was not. We thought it was disrespectful since the children were asleep"

I am not giving it 5 stars because there was a group of young people having a party in the plot above. They got their attention but when it was already quite late and they had already protested a couple of times."
14452,2407438,5,svrt,27/09/2022,Nice clean campsite. There is a bath for babies on request and a small sandy beach for sunbathing but not for swimming. Wash and dry for €3 each. Different sized pitches that were free to choose from.

14452,2062898,2,eijmers,12/07/2022,"Overpriced. Paid 39 euros per night for a camper, 2 people and electricity. Yes, the location is quite good, but that’s it. The facilities are very outdated. Pitches are quite small. A lot of people on the campsite like to blast their own music, which makes it a very noisy site."

14452,1888426,5,pk1tour,14/05/2022,"Nice campsite. Large pitches also for 7.30 meter campers. Beautiful view. The supermarket is currently closed until June, so it is better to stock up on drinks and food in a supermarket beforehand if you want to stay longer. Alternatively, there is a small mom and pop supermarket 3 km towards Oia. Bread can be ordered at reception. Great fish restaurant up the road. Highly recommended!! There is also a restaurant at the campsite itself."
14452,1859756,4,roadtrip3003,29/04/2022,"Only to recommend. Very great location, right on the sea. Clean bathrooms and toilets and hot water. Very nice employees.

Rocks for climbing at low tide and high tide, playground etc. - We (42, 41, 5, 2) were lucky enough to have wonderful weather and an empty space. Otherwise it is difficult to find a place with a large motorhome. Right now there is no parcel, so the alignment is fiddly work! Basically a great feeling on the pitch!"
14452,1163931,1,Joserram,02/04/2021,"16 Hours, 2 Adults, 1 child and the AC. 35 Euros, I consider it very expensive. It is very well located, with the Sea and the Beach next to it, but if you are looking for tranquility, it passes by, there are many children in it, with what it entails in terms of racing and screaming. It is more suitable for caravans and tents, that is, long periods or several days."
14452,1072354,5,jaa45,27/09/2020,"Friendly staff. Clean bathrooms and services. In high season bar, supermarket and restaurant. It has a tennis court and a children's park.

Absolutely stunning location - overlooking the coast, sea and mountains. The site itself is immaculate with a beautiful pool, windmill and the sites are spacious and well looked after. The showers are hot, toilets clean.
The welcome was good - no English, but got by in my Spanish. Very good value @20€ for 2 with electricity and the shop wasn’t open as it is the low season here.
Wifi actually works well around the campsite and not only in the reception or bar - about the only one in all the campsites we have been in!
Will certainly return - quiet and very beautiful!!"

The ""cove"" does not have a beach to bathe as such, they are stones but it does have a sandy area to lie on. Very quiet, with swimming pool and sports courts. The only downside is that it seems a bit expensive to me, € 35 for two people in a van with electricity."

14452,491073,4,vrast,23/05/2019,"Very nice campground. They have a small sand beach, but swimming is around sharp rocks, so advise wearing beach shoes. We took a nice hike up the small mountain behind the campground - the view is worth the hike, although we got a bit lost (the path is not marked very well). Facilities are clean. Hosts are very accommodating (you can get sports equipment [Tennis/Soccer] at the reception). Normally the place is locked at night until 8 AM, but since we had to leave early a workaround was arranged without problems."

14507,3276040,2,broer00,09/09/2023,"Second time we are here. This site meets all our requirements, however ..... the municipality of Foz has failed to place a warning that the water is not suitable for consumption! In my opinion a bad thing. Inquiries with the local population show that drinking water is regularly not suitable for consumption in the municipality of Foz. Agree with the previous speaker. See comment from September 5, 2023 User: IGTE"
14507,3271217,5,euskalgaston,08/09/2023,"Next to the town with clean and dirty water service, very quiet"

Cozy town to walk around, have a drink in its many bars and restaurants, beautiful beaches and a very pleasant route along the coast, with a very well-defined bike path separated from the pedestrian path. Thank you FOZ for giving us so much space, I hope the example spreads in other coastal areas."

14507,3266004,4,joaljoal,06/09/2023,"thank you very much to whom it may concern...spectacular views of the estuary on the first line, now we will spend on restaurants and shops"
14507,3261473,1,lgte,05/09/2023,careful! You can't drink the tap water in Foz but they don't put it anywhere. The Government made a statement on August 3 that there were harmful substances in the water and it was recommended not to drink it or use it for cooking. It's a shame and I think it's terrible that they don't put it in the water tap where many of us get water from to drink and cook. everything else perfect
14507,3244833,5,Osso,01/09/2023,"fantastic place. no shade but big, flat, and beautiful views"

14507,3103474,1,Webkayaker,08/08/2023,"As the partner has said, from August 8 to 12 it does not work. Few places on the edge of the pier, almost impossible to find a place. Fair noise, little privacy. The water comes out dirty, yellowish. The traffic within the semi-collapsed town. Continuous circular of motorhomes and campers looking for a place, without getting it. Nothing recommended."
14507,3101664,5,klaudithor,08/08/2023,"The area is great, flat, many places, discharge and refill of water. Mercadona 10 minutes walk. BEWARE, FROM AUGUST 8 TO 5:00 PM, UNTIL AUGUST 12, ARE THE PEOPLE'S FESTIVALS. AND YOU CANNOT PARK. THERE ARE SIGNS THAT INDICATE IT. These spaces are used to park the cars that go to the fair."
14507,3090185,4,maitxu84,06/08/2023,"It is very good, near the center and in front of the water, full of AC but everything is fine. Every morning the baker comes with her van, she is very nice and everything is very tasty. recommendable"
14507,3084312,3,lopezku,05/08/2023,"The parking area is fine if it doesn't rain, because it's dirt, to discharge black and gray water it's fine, now to fill clean water it's very bad, there are 2 poorly marked taps together, where do they clean the poti to load the water clean, and the water comes out brown. I do not recommend it to do water loads. test before filling in a clear can"

14507,3065357,2,park4nightYHN,02/08/2023,Wide area next to the estuary with beautiful views. Inconvenient the bad smell of the treatment plant that is right next door. There is also a bad smell on the beach. We left ahead of schedule
14507,3061845,5,rocio82,02/08/2023,"Great area, lots of AC but there is plenty of room, spectacular views of the estuary and the nearby beach, a spectacular beach, good water. Next to it a small beach area for dogs. When the tide rises, a large pool is made that does not cover for the little ones. Good atmosphere and market on Tuesdays. The baker comes by in the morning."

14507,3028970,2,licordyerva,27/07/2023,"The number of motorhomes is beastly, some stuck to each other, fights for unloading, the site and the town hall a 10, but the crowd is enormous, let's not turn a paradise into something so crowded, diversity and education."
14507,3003849,5,ElChispi71,22/07/2023,"This is how many towns in Spain learned from Foz. Many thanks to the City Council for supporting motorhome tourism and bringing us closer to its restaurants and local businesses. Huge area, very well located and with water services working properly."

14507,2989598,3,Rosetjaune,19/07/2023,"There are many ACs, it seems that people park there for weeks. I guess it will be townspeople leaving their own because it doesn't make much sense. If you go in AC the place is not bad, but with a van I did not like it at all. I left."
14507,2982514,4,ConnorZik,18/07/2023,"Large open grassy area to park where you can. Very busy here, must have been 100 campervans or so. Ground is flat and offers WC waste and water services. 
Sunrises over the water if you can get a spot with the view of that. Mercadona and laundrette in the town. 
Civil Guard patrolled in the evening to check no one was camping and noise from the bar at night until midnight"
14507,2979777,3,Garrin,17/07/2023,overcrowded by AC that seem to not move... to get to know the town and spend a night is fine... no more.

14507,2926448,3,Ummo,05/07/2023,"Today, a good hundred motorhomes on the vast esplanade bordering the wharf, which is almost full. Only one service station, everything is free for the moment, this place attracts too many motorhomes. We left to spend the night elsewhere."
14507,2916506,5,Costablanca,02/07/2023,"A phenomenal area that we could lose if the lack of respect from the number of people who do not comply with the established rules of not removing chairs, tables, and even awnings continues. I have even seen people camping under trees with tents. We should call the municipal when we see this type of behavior."
14507,2912772,5,jumave,01/07/2023,"6/29/2023 a lot of space we have more than 70 motorhomes, one of them hits the motorhomes in the row that faces the estuary and looks like they are not moving"

Shops and local food market on Tuesday mornings a few meters away. Level squares without the need for wedges in some areas.

We were lucky we parked on the first line, the neighboring ACs at a prudent distance to have some privacy and comfort. Being next to the road, the passage of cars is common. More than 100 ACs, it's a lottery what you can have close. The bakery passes around 9:35 am and beeps a lot!"

The baker comes by around 9:30, and carries very good products. Perfect to stop en route or spend a few days. I wish there were more town halls like the one in Foz."
14507,2522618,5,Arto2018,16/12/2022,Really great view of the Bay of Foz. We stood here without any problems and would love to come back anytime. Thank you to the community for this opportunity to be here.

14507,2504018,5,emax88,23/11/2022,"Free, sea view and with many places available... what more could you want? The walks that start along the coast from Foz are memorable! In the low season there are few campers, you always find a place. The loading unloading is on the other side of the road, a little narrow but usable. Advice: the baker who comes by in the morning with the van has very good products, take advantage of them!"
14507,2502792,5,egoman,22/11/2022,"great view of the estuary and harbor. However, because of the storm, I left again."

14507,2480114,5,icaro5L,03/11/2022,"A great place !!! Thanks to the municipality for allowing me to spend 3 wonderful days in a spectacular setting, I also very much appreciated the great civilization of the fellow campers who with a lot of education and discretion have shown that if we want we can be part of a healthy community, respecting others and especially those who host us by not making us feel only marginalized."
14507,2467299,5,ourvanhelsing,28/10/2022,Difficult to add anything that hasn't already been said. It's not the prettiest of towns but the parkup has the most incredible view. Good hiking on the beach path. Many thanks to the town for this facility.
14507,2465049,5,bubuvantana,27/10/2022,We stood here for 1 night with our Sprinter. Everything went well and we felt safe. There is sufficient parking space and a filling/emptying station for fresh/grey and black water.
14507,2461293,5,HelmutMeyer,25/10/2022,Thanks to the city of Foz for this free overnight stay with supply and disposal station. We had a level pitch with a beautiful view of the water and city. This is within walking distance.

14507,2418893,5,Edurtxu,02/10/2022,"Great area, one of the best I've seen, just one drawback, a single emptying and filling service for everyone. In the middle of August it must be to take it with patience, thanks to the town hall for choosing this beautiful area for the area"
14507,2417626,5,qrzchango,02/10/2022,"For me, it could be one of the best areas to spend the night, above the sea, a large, comfortable area, grass, aligned, without noise, an area where you can empty and load water for free. Of the best"
14507,2414259,5,JVCaravan,30/09/2022,good the day is cloudy but it is lively anyway a place to spend the weekend
14507,2412506,5,Archelon5,29/09/2022,"Very large, flat land with a view of the estuary and direct access to the seafront and the coastal path. Ideal for fishing motorhomes. Plus, it's free. It makes you want to consume and the city is very welcoming and well equipped with a variety of shops."
14507,2407559,4,valou0304,27/09/2022,Very large parking lot along the water and the port. Very quiet at night. thank you to the municipality for granting us this large parking lot. In addition drains and water available on the other side of the road. thank you

14507,2383237,5,JAGOBO,18/09/2022,"Good area, relatively flat near the Foze estuary. A quiet place with nice views. The baker comes by in the mornings. On Tuesdays, there is a small market next to the arena, which is worth visiting and buying local and autochthonous products."
14507,2380201,5,lunamedano,17/09/2022,Large free area in front of the sea and a few minutes from the town center. All services and flat area. Next door there are two other small parking areas.
14507,2379978,5,Sin.deentrega,17/09/2022,very good area. Totally recommended. Thanks to the council.
14507,2365746,5,Mizdo,12/09/2022,"Exceptional area with an unbeatable location with all services. Only clouded by some cheeky people who think they own the place they occupy and leave junk as a reserve when they go out so that they don't occupy ""the place as if they were the owner of it."" of shame"
14507,2365454,5,JesusArtime,12/09/2022,"Many thanks to the city council of Foz for this beautiful area in a privileged place, a town where you can eat in luxury and feel at home again, thanks for loving us"
14507,2364783,5,javyalonso,12/09/2022,"Magnificent and huge area for motorhomes with all functional services. In addition, you are in a very quiet area of the town and sheltered from the winds and tides. fantastic!"
14507,2350597,3,belette12,08/09/2022,nice place but beware of incivilities late at night or even at night.
14507,2339312,2,Andrea50,04/09/2022,"Excellent place!!! Spacious, clean, it's nice to find these places in such beautiful places!"
14507,2334322,5,audegus,03/09/2022,"Good spot, certainly with a lot of people but it moves often. Access to several restaurants and the beach and also to the city of Foz. The baker comes by every morning"
14507,2324540,5,Curribaldieros,31/08/2022,"beautiful area in front of the Foz estuary, very spacious, with grass, very close to restaurants and shops. Today I saw the gas truck delivering. Refrain those who want an area for themselves."
14507,2323351,5,erramonet,31/08/2022,"Place very well prepared for the big AC, I went on a Tuesday coinciding with the market and there is enough space to park and be able to visit the town"
14507,2320902,5,Lusanfer,30/08/2022,"I wish there were many sites like this. The pity is that we will end up losing it due to the misuse of selfish users. Large motorhomes with their trailer, their car parked outside the trailer, boat, bicycles, outside awning, tables, etc. and long stays without moving. It is a pity that the city council cannot regulate this for the benefit of all."
14507,2320835,4,petralenssen,30/08/2022,Very busy place. A fantastic view. Bars and restaurants very close as is the beach and also a dog beach. Please note: Tuesday is market day - next to the campers everything is full of cars from people who come to the market. They are placed everywhere in such a way that you no longer get on or off the place.
14507,2316872,4,AkiraEnea,29/08/2022,"Very nice views, good grass. Close to bars, restaurants..."
14507,2306024,5,ea1abm,26/08/2022,"exceptional, a luxury, let's see if other municipalities copy, thanks"
14507,2305911,4,Mbwa,26/08/2022,Not slept but thank you for the free services to the municipality. Many CC parked facing the estuary.
14507,2304656,3,tash389,26/08/2022,"Large parking area for motorhomes on grass/sandy ground, with a good service point, unfortunately there must of been over 100 motorhomes parked 3 deep like sardines.. plenty of local Spanish had set up camp for a few days. Not the prettiest town, but lovely beach. Inext time I would stay on opposite side of the water and look at Foz"
14507,2295345,5,ririvivi,24/08/2022,Stop for lunch only because many people. All lined up by the sea and near the port. Free water and emptying. Thanks
14507,2292667,1,sebroxou81,23/08/2022,"You have to like being in an onion row… we turned around, not possible for us to be on top of each other…."
14507,2276365,4,YanBabou,20/08/2022,"Very nice surprise! Lots of motorhomes but a magnificent view, a skate park for children and pretty birds!"
14507,2272281,5,german75,20/08/2022,"large parking area, many camper places, loading and unloading."
14507,2266941,5,LoisCes,19/08/2022,"Very good parking. Very large areas, with an area for emptying and filling tanks. Very close walk from the town. Many thanks to the City Council of Foz for making this area."
14507,2265839,5,FMFO,19/08/2022,Absolutely recommended. Beautiful place and beautiful town with magnificent beaches. The only flaw: just 1 loading and unloading space is not enough for all the campers who frequent it.
14507,2264825,2,Sandracg90,19/08/2022,"Too crowded, when we arrived it was packed with motorhomes that didn't look like they had moved in days! We asked the police if we could sleep in the parking lot next door and they said yes, no problem (except on the weekly market day). On Monday the baker came by in a van (with delicious hot tuna empanada)"
14507,2264095,2,alexyanezdelacal,18/08/2022,"Very very crowded site, with users occupying 2-3 seats with their second vehicle even with their chairs, the truth is that we lack respect for ourselves, as it happened, it's fine, but nothing more..."
14507,2244572,1,Corcho,15/08/2022,"I find it incredible that people like something like this, super crowded, and it's not that the site is amazing. Perhaps in the low season it is worth it but in August... hundreds of motorhomes stuck together and the front line ones live there. Thanks to the town hall, but I prefer to continue traveling."
14507,2234695,5,Berlingo95,14/08/2022,"We spent one night there, it is a very spacious and very quiet place. A few minutes walk we can find many restaurants."
14507,2234449,4,Covelar,14/08/2022,"Level area, with services next to the estuary, unbeatable views. We could not park in the area because it is overcrowded with AC that are fixed, taking everything out as if it were a campsite. We had to park in a side street, where we were quiet. The council should regularize this! As another friend says in previous comments, the town is beautiful but it does NOT invite you to stay"
14507,2227329,3,HotelRodinhas,13/08/2022,"crowded area. It is good to make a stop and visit Foz, but it does not invite you to stay."
14507,2218864,5,perichs,11/08/2022,"thanks to the town hall of foz for giving us a place to park and spend the night. It is right next to the town and you can have tapas and there is an ice cream parlor (which, by the way, the Galician ice creams are very good) they were at a fair when we went and it was very lively. Great we will return we were very quiet and we really liked the town"
14507,2208790,3,layeke,10/08/2022,very good spot with plenty of room. to avoid at this time because there is the carnival and the village festival. loud music until 4 a.m. impossible to sleep and impossible to leave because the cars were blocking the motorhomes
14507,2168871,5,Minotavrvs,03/08/2022,"In terms of location, condition and services we give it a 10. We were going with the idea of spending the day and spending the night but we have gone to sleep somewhere else. There was more than enough room since it is huge, but it was hyper mega crowded. Checked comments indicating people installed for life in the front line. There was a fair these days, about to start and it is attached to the area."
14507,2165278,3,Toja22,03/08/2022,"An HUGE area full of campers but you'll find a spot as it's really huge. 
Very quiet and clean. All services work.
In front of the sea and next to a municipal gym.There are also free gym equipment outside.
The town and the beach are at few steps.
I gave 3stars only because I didn't not find the area appealing, but it's just my opinion."
14507,2143195,4,joelmiguel,29/07/2022,"Good place, flat and with services overlooking the river. Thanks to Foz for providing this place!"
14507,2131873,3,damifurgo,27/07/2022,"Too crowded and little respect for the conditions, it looks like a campsite: motorbikes, tables, bikes and awnings can be seen at night deployed outside the place that belongs to it, yes, views, proximity to the center and spectacular walks"
14507,2131257,5,Escalam,27/07/2022,"El Área as always very good and close to the town (but too crowded), we stayed for three days and took advantage of the noise they were making at the Port, many thanks to Foz City Council"
14507,2130178,5,vicenteacebal,27/07/2022,"Good area, thanks to the municipality of Foz. As some comments say, the first line is impossible to park, occupied by motorhomes that must be there for weeks in summer, so everything is a very good place, let's take care of it."
14507,2115900,5,ardianto,24/07/2022,"As always a 10 for foz, magnificent town to visit and eat"
14507,2112731,5,Jayla,23/07/2022,"Great motorhome area, with free water service and so large that it is difficult for there to be no room. That if the first line for the fixed ones that do not move or to change waters, buckets go and buckets come, a shame!"
14507,2105998,1,LaBichoZgz,22/07/2022,"I give a star for the lack of civility we have. tables, motorcycles, trailers, the gray drain open all day, if we do not take care and respect what they give us for free, then we do not complain about height barriers or that there is only payment. Let's see if we understand that an area is a place of passage, to be at our ease there are the campsites. And the worst thing is that you can't say anything because they insult you."
14507,2098106,2,carolps,20/07/2022,"It's cool, camping is prohibited, take out tables and chairs. This inconvenient year the fair is there, bad atmosphere and a lot of noise"
14507,2095578,3,rachaelmharri,19/07/2022,We only used the facilities for emptying grey/black waters and filling up with water.  Looked very busy.  Plenty of other quieter places nearby to spend the night for visiting Foz and its beautiful beach without a ghetto atmosphere.
14507,2088965,3,jdhr,18/07/2022,"The area is great, a bit far from the beach... and from the town but what annoys me the most? THE SETTLEMENTS, people who spend weeks… months… without moving and this is starting to get crowded and people don't know where to go. The trip with a bucket full of gray and return with a bottle of clean ones in the morning is crazy. In the end they will have to ban as always, because every day there is LESS CIVITY"
14507,2087602,4,andonilau,18/07/2022,"Good area to spend a night and visit the town and its beaches. Coincidentally they are parties and they put the verbena and the barracks next door. Otherwise, all good."
14507,2086654,5,BeaKike,17/07/2022,Giant parking with all services. Nice walk along the estuary and perfect to see the town. Delighted with the number of areas we are finding
14507,2075923,2,jammstyler,15/07/2022,"Jammstyler was here and left… good parking to visit the town of Foz. Services invaded by retirees and a place like a town without control. A little more control with the issue of camping would not hurt. The place is good, the human being is the one who has to change."
14507,2069040,4,javisam,13/07/2022,"very good place to spend a couple of days at the beach and walks, the only negative that people (especially older people) use it as a campsite, taking out awnings, tables, etc, when they close this type of area people will lie down head in hands"
14507,2045259,5,FamiliaGT,06/07/2022,"Spectacular views. Close to places to eat. We liked the walk a lot. Also being able to go down to the marsh area at low tide, the children have enjoyed it a lot. At night it seems quiet."
14507,2041890,5,Azatota,05/07/2022,"Thanks to the municipality of Foz for the area, if other municipalities in Spain take note"
14507,2041763,5,luisita70,05/07/2022,"very good area, large and very well located, near the town"
14507,2023144,5,Padinator,30/06/2022,"A perfect place to park, get to know the town and spend the night. It has free emptying and filling. 100% recommended"
14507,2012562,4,Mistercactus,26/06/2022,this is the second time that we have passed there more people than the first time (October) comfortable calm at night during the day we line up for services.
14507,2011141,4,GooseandSwan,26/06/2022,Safe area close to town and overlooking the river. Lots of other motorhomes and plenty of spaces available. Water refill and greywater station provided. Had trouble understanding which tap was for drinking water. Pathway along the waterfront leading into town was lovely for an evening walk.
14507,1985316,5,CristinaMMarias,17/06/2022,"Magnificent area. Thanks to the town hall of Foz for making things easier for us and to its people for their warm welcome. Beautiful walk along the coast. It eats wonderfully. We recommend 'O Pier Bar'. All very good, especially their scallops and octopus croquettes. We will come back here, without a doubt."
14507,1972915,4,CarlosDuque,13/06/2022,"Very spacious and comfortable area. The Paseo Marítimo at 5 meters, then water, depending on the tides. Grass. They cut frequently. Today, Monday, I play and the machines woke us up at 9 in the morning. Water services are fine. Everything is very close, bars, restaurants, Rapadoira Beach... The Cathedrals are 15 km away. We were on Sunday and Monday and the fog did not leave us in the 2 days...Acceptable."
14507,1972488,5,Atbury,13/06/2022,We just stayed one night and it was right on the estuary. There is a place to change black and grey water. Short walk into town for bars and restaurants.
14507,1966908,5,Franfr1,11/06/2022,Excellent Ac area. We were very comfortable for two days. It has very good views towards the estuary and in the background you can see the sea. The town is 5 minutes away and there are good bars and restaurants nearby where you can eat dinner etc... There is a water service and to empty the black water. We will repeat for sure. Thanks to whoever made this possible!
14507,1937126,5,micky57,01/06/2022,very beautiful view. Accessible to all types of vehicle. Close to shops. Not tested the services

It is located a few meters from the center of Foz, where we have several bars to eat well and cheaply, as well as supermarkets. There is a beautiful 4 km promenade from the Area to Llas beach. We stayed for a weekend, it is only allowed to stay overnight for 48 hours."

Parking between very close campers, zero privacy and side view."

14507,1741335,5,Ankow6,25/01/2022,"We didn't spend the night, but the parking lot is spectacular, with great views. When it comes to filling/emptying water, there are some containers that get in the way a bit for long ACs, but it can be done without a problem. A totally open area where the wind can hit hard, even so it is 100% recommended"
14507,1738301,4,Rasjahcor,21/01/2022,"Wide and always sleeps accompanied. Good to visit the town although when the wind hits the one on the other side of the estuary is better. Good pressure in the filling tap, although emptying is a bit uncomfortable with vehicles over 7 meters. Many thanks to Foz!"

Fully working services, no visits from local police. Some motor homes showing camping behaviour, this trend is causing closures along this beautiful coast."

14507,1531644,4,elenacastroposada,30/08/2021,"Very grateful to the people of Foz for providing a spacious and clean space for motorhomes, I can only add my opinion that another water intake and drain would be necessary, it would be perfect !!"
14507,1528616,5,Naty65,29/08/2021,"Second time we are, we slept well, we will return, market on Tuesdays."

14507,1509949,1,BasilBolty,25/08/2021,"This is officially the worst park up on earth. Don't get me wrong, it's not the area or location, it's the people, hundreds of them...

The locals clearly hate us too, cars blasting horns as they drive past all night long.  AVOID in the same way you avoid getting in a lift with a man with a Covid cough!"
14507,1509493,1,eriknoa,25/08/2021,"It is disgusting to see how people behave, I turned around because it was unbearable, people washing clothes and dishes in the only water outlet, cars with mattresses inside sleeping and relieving themselves in the surroundings. the caravans stuck together and with chairs and clotheslines outside."

14507,1492410,5,IzanSpain300,21/08/2021,The site is good and in general there is a good caravan atmosphere. But when emptying waters be careful that there is a guy who should not walk very well on the roof and threatens you with insults and voices with a fine and I do not know how much more nonsense.
14507,1485977,4,DRojas,20/08/2021,"Perfect motorhome town ..... it's nice to see this coexistence. To put a but, a single point of loading and unloading falls short, the rest is perfect."
14507,1484749,4,keposs,20/08/2021,"The place is great, how close it is to many services. We were great, highly recommended."

14507,1483171,4,pattper,19/08/2021,"Another baker comes by at 10:30 am / 10:45 am. It passes in the middle of the motorhomes, no need to move. the tourist office has moved, it is located in a modern building near the second port, near the beach."
14507,1478770,4,lpomposo,18/08/2021,"Spectacular area with services and very wide. Although when we arrived my son stepped into a broken gutter and hurt himself. Be careful, it is next to the drain."

14507,1455004,5,Rafikis,14/08/2021,"We parked there to visit the town. We must thank the Ayto de Foz for the initiative. Not only is it a huge area (and grass!), but it is also on the first line of the estuary and close to the town, unlike other areas that are set up in remote places, industrial estates, cemeteries, and other charming places. For that reason alone, Foz is already worth our visit. How many of us stop there already just for the area…. As simple as that"
14507,1448943,5,autokarramarra,13/08/2021,"Huge area in Foz. Today we have made more than 200 ACs night. And despite that the night was super quiet. A 10 for Foz that surely this generates a lot of income. Also from 8.30 am the baker passes through the area with bread, pastries and empanadas!"

14507,1413374,5,mjcuenca,06/08/2021,"Great AC area, we'd be like 80 sleeping and still quiet. Views of the estuary, and next to the port and its restaurants. In the morning the baker passes by with his van to sell fresh bread and pastries. Keep in mind that there is only one filling and emptying area, so be patient and respect the queue."
14507,1412194,3,InigoFS,06/08/2021,"A simple wasteland. Privileged place, yes. Despite a single loading and unloading point, thank the Foz city council for it. And also to users, since there is absolute tranquility and, with the exception of a couple of vans, the rest have complied with the regulations on camping."
14507,1411981,3,pandas438,06/08/2021,"Well out of the summer season, but at the moment it looks more like a camp, we are sometimes less than one meter 50, in the middle of the night at any time they have people arriving and doing noise as in broad daylight, so unless you are completely deaf, it is far from calm and in the morning the baker honking his horn as he passes behind the vehicles."
14507,1411834,5,PierdeElNorte,06/08/2021,"Spectacular views, on the first line. With gray water and water service. It is quite crowded, but the key is to come in the morning. Very quiet and with a supermarket and restaurants 3 minutes away."

14507,1370998,4,paabloviedo,27/07/2021,Very nice area next to the sea. Overlooking the estuary. Very close to the center to dine in one of the nearby bars. The bad thing is that some consider it a campsite and they are there for several days. Then we complain !!!
14507,1366856,5,lavicg,26/07/2021,"Unbeatable location, in front of the estuary. Free services. Foz has a great beach, a bike path to get to the Ouro river route, and to the Castro de Fazouro. Do not miss the portions of the grocery store ""Rente Au Mar"""

14507,1335926,4,leyenda67,18/07/2021,"Huge place where you can meet people from anywhere, very good atmosphere, in the middle of July the sun has not been oppressive because it is cloudy and without raining, parking I call or you hardly have to put shoes on, some vehicle noise at night if you you stay on the side of the road"
14507,1332844,4,calichy,17/07/2021,We had a very quiet night. Many acs vans and cars with a lot of space. Dirt floor with grass. Near the town and nice walk. Sites like this are appreciated.
14507,1332382,4,jaglopez24,17/07/2021,"Terrific site, lots of people from the guild but the site is huge. The downside is the loading and unloading area, with the amount of people there I think there should be two, and the worst of all is that the tap has no pressure whatsoever, I spent half an hour to fill the tank. The port, the beach and the beautiful promenade, the town does not have much else."
14507,1329063,4,borjasl,16/07/2021,"A very cool place, level and with a lot of capacity. It would need to improve the loading and unloading area, since the nose of the ac is almost on the billboard."

14507,1319483,4,aponz,13/07/2021,"The area is great. I'm not giving it 5 stars because the faucet runs so slow and an incredible queue forms to constantly fill and empty. It is a parking lot, please Do Not Take Tables AND CHAIRS. the baker passes every day."
14507,1319022,5,Eduito,13/07/2021,Good area. Attached to the dock. In a while you are on the ride. The area is very quiet. There is a bar on the corner called omuelle which is very good and we had a very comfortable dinner.
14507,1318684,3,raulmr51,12/07/2021,"Good area in this very busy time, I do not put more stars because the clean water refill is push-button and it is not comfortable at all, with the arrangement of this small incident it would be a 5-star area, thank you very much to the Foz city council for this area, although the thanks would be total by changing a simple tap."
14507,1308139,5,satuco,09/07/2021,"A new service, from July 7, 2021 the bakery passes around 9:30 with good empanadas and croissants in addition to bread."
14507,1306514,4,maretxeur,08/07/2021,"Many thanks to the city council of foz for this AC area, the only downside, the low water flow and the push button, with how easy a tap is. Thank you very much for thinking of us"
14507,1304725,5,Eduito,08/07/2021,"We have only been there for one day, but the area is very quiet and in a very beautiful place. In a moment you are in the town and on the beach promenade. When you leave the parking lot there is a bar on the corner that is very good, it is called Omuelle. We had dinner there tonight and we loved it."

14507,1298795,4,Remolin,05/07/2021,"Great area to visit Foz and its delicious restaurants. The area is huge, making the single dump point very crowded. It would be advisable to open a second emptying point as well as to divide the squares to offer an image of order. The views of the estuary are exceptional"
14507,1295328,4,carideperez,04/07/2021,area with all services perfect to visit the town.
14507,1293329,2,PipaFucina,03/07/2021,"A horror in July. We have gone. A service point for about 50 motorhomes. It was saturated. In another season it must be better, although it is still a dusty esplanade without a hint of shade. Of course, the views in the front row must be beautiful, that's why I gave it two stars."

Mercadona 10 minutes walk. The filling and emptying area is fine. Only to fill the water it has a low flow rate and you have to keep pressing the button all the time. Highly recommended.

14507,1161768,5,Nessitinha_1979,31/03/2021,"Large area for AC. To sleep quiet area. The space to empty the tanks is very good, the only one but is that the water tap is by button."
14507,1152611,5,cscastro,16/03/2021,"Very nice, quiet and comfortable place. To put a defect, the push-button tap is a nuisance to fill water."
14507,1134753,5,tamaraydavid,03/02/2021,"motorhome area with drain and water. with a large parking lot next door. you have Foz city next door, supermarkets eight minutes away and shops. to sleep anywhere on the coast is better than here. but it is not a bad option either and there is no noise at night"

14507,1027557,5,CrisRodAri,05/09/2020,"One of the best places we have been: not for its great (basic) services, but for the tranquility, the space and the wonderful views. On Tuesdays at 08.00 you have to collect because the weekly fair stands are set up."

14507,1013731,5,danymh,30/08/2020,"Good place to spend the night. squares with grass. With views of the rias. On the left, about 800m a sandy beach. On the right routes for walking or cycling. To put one downside, the taps for water filling should be well marked. People get confused when it comes to using them. The threaded one for clean water, the pressure one for black ones."
14507,1011080,5,misas,29/08/2020,Extraordinary!!!
14507,1002973,3,Jomilon,26/08/2020,"Pros: spectacular place in front of the Foz estuary. Free. With emptying services. I doubt he will ever get lkenned. Very nice town with exceptional beach. Cons. You can get the typical people to take out chairs and stay until 2.00 am chatting and laughing loudly. Being free ... Cars usually pass by. If you go with children, it is recommended to go to another area."

14507,984656,4,blor,20/08/2020,Great place in keeping with the town. Foz is worth going through in every way. Perhaps the area should have double everything due to the large amount of ACS in the parking lot. The best I've ever seen.
14507,983698,4,Lolololez,20/08/2020,"Well located, level and with loading and emptying points (1 single point and a multitude of vehicles, you have to wait at rush hour). Very spacious, no problems. They pass by handing out bread and pastries in the morning. Good sunrise views. Many bars and areas where you can have a drink and listen to music in the surroundings. TUESDAY FORBIDDEN from 8: 00-14: 00 for the market. Respect for the rules NO CAMPING."
14507,975539,4,orain,17/08/2020,"Great place but be careful on Tuesdays from 8 to 14 there is a market you cannot park. Emptying and filling area always busy and with queue. Please, you cannot camp (no awnings, chairs, tables...) and then they throw us out of all the places!!!!! There is a camperarea and camping in the same town to take out whatever you want"
14507,964119,4,Lunila,15/08/2020,"Great place to sleep, it is very large, flat and fits any car. Very cool views, no shadows. The beach 20 minutes walk. To put one downside, a lot of queue to empty and fill, it is one at a time and we were many. The water tap is small threaded."
14507,954455,4,AnayAndreu,12/08/2020,"Perfect, level, large and on the banks of the estuary. If there is a problem, it is that the water exchange space is a bit ""small"" for so many cars, and that it does not have shade, but in Galicia the sun is appreciated. ;) Thank you Foz for thinking of us. Negative point for motorhomers who don't know how to distinguish between parking and camping, find a campsite guys!!"

14507,878549,4,joanjo,18/07/2020,"Giant area in front of the estuary, from where begins a beautiful path that skirts the cliffs. The service area has two taps (one for the chemical and the other for drinking water), but the gray drain grid can be improved. Since there is a lot of influx, you always have to wait hard to empty in the morning."

14508,3137797,4,jruiz68,13/08/2023,"Someone emptied the toilet into the hydrant drain the day before yesterday. A neighbor broke it down. Yesterday another character repeated the play. The neighbor has decided to leave the feces floating, I assume they cleaned the water in the hydrant. In addition to endangering everyone's health, due to these behaviors it is not surprising that in some places they prefer another type of tourism."
14508,3095966,5,AdrianCotelo,07/08/2023,Good place to load and empty

The town is recommended to visit, and there are also hiking and mountain biking routes in the area. And on top of that we took a typical Mondoñedo cake and a very awarded empanada."
14508,2946280,4,JuPeteras,10/07/2023,"If it says P for motorhomes because they allow cars to park... if they can park cars, make a separate area for them. It is not understood.. it is a want and I cannot. And above all, we must give thanks for thinking of us."

It needs a little tlc but there is grey water emptying and water to fill your tanks and a bar just next door where we are able to use the toilets. Don't miss the cathedral Square which was buzzing when we  went to eat breakfast, with pilgrims from the Camino."

14508,2245278,1,jonaskesh,15/08/2022,"Honestly, a shame. Try to stop yesterday, 8/14, and 40% of the spaces occupied by cars. There was even a car parked at the sewage dump, completely hindering the ability to empty or fill water. It seems great to me that they are town festivals, but it is inadmissible that in a parking lot destined for a type of vehicle, they do what they want without a fine. Shameful"

The empanadas from a little shop in the Plaza de la Catedral are recommended, be sure to try them (it has boxes of fruit and nuts outside, next to the pharmacy). We could not load water because we did not have the size of the hose coupling. All services were operational."

14508,2070103,2,aponz,13/07/2022,to see the town it is fine but to sleep very inclined. In the regulations it says not to use stabilizers... so it's complicated... The rest of the car parks in the town are the same or more inclined... so it's a shame. also say that the area is a little left.

Good filling and emptying services with a good filling pressure and screw tap. I do not give it more punctuation because the truth is that it is quite out of the city and I did not see bus service (I do not know if there is one) and it is not located in a beautiful place.

The source is the one of the whole life of pressing button and without thread, but with a rope you block it and the flexible hose enters the mouth perfectly. It is very quiet, without riots or bottles; We do not understand how it is not used anymore since there is a lot of room. We were the first half of July2018"

There is a walk nearby, surrounding the port of Ferrol. The worst thing is that at night there was noise: cars with music, people passing by shouting for the simple fact of annoying ... (it was Saturday night, maybe another day there is less noise ...)"
14510,91228,1,willvy,08/08/2016,"It is in the parking area of ​​the town's municipal swimming pool. If you do not know where the urban center is, it seems that it is difficult for you to access, with the slopes for pedestrian access. It is the typical parking area of ​​motorhomes that they do to send us out of town. Then, when you go looking for another alternative, they indicate that you have an indicated area."

Young people driving a fighting dog on the parking lot and another group performing a rodeo car on this desert parking lot. not very engaging It is therefore better to spend the night on the car park lidl or carrefourt.

In summer and especially on weekends it is impossible to park due to the amount of people who go to the beach. Around dinner time, an individual appears who calls himself the owner of the bar and says that we can't stay overnight. I have already contacted the GNR of Torre de Moncorvo who informed that this gentleman does not have any authority to do so"
14534,1926336,1,jacqies,28/05/2022,At this location there is a guy who comes around at 20:30 saying that it is not allowed to stay overnight. However since there is no sign saying that overnight stay is not allowed this is not true. We however moved to the other side of the river where we stayed a night with music from the village and fire works at prime location!

OK, understood, but what authority would you have to approach us in an intimidating tone?"

Wake up at 3am with loud comings and goings, cars turning doors slamming, talking aloud ..... until 5am. We slept from 5 to 6 because at 6 o'clock came the street sweeper a roaring machine that was passed and ironed until we decided to leave the premises. We ended the night at the Torre de Moncorvo area much quieter. Our worst memory of Portugal ....."

The town is pretty but since they don't want us and won't let us park, we didn't stop to eat and buy, which was our intention. Too bad, we continue the trip and we will stop in another place where they let us park."
14547,3161180,1,JoseLetiBubu,16/08/2023,"The filling and emptying fulfills its function, but we have parked in the parking lot next to the indoor pool, and a local policeman has arrived knocking on all the doors of the motorhomes warning that it is NOT an AC Area itself, it cannot be parked. Immediately afterwards we have left, we are not welcome in Ortigueira, we will not return."

14547,3084298,1,Alforjero,05/08/2023,It is much appreciated but it is very neglected and without information of use. A single tap for gray and black. The black chest is under the motorhome and the rainwater grid is cut out and tends to be confused.

14547,2934854,1,Osegui,07/07/2023,"A single faucet and the black water must be poured into a broken trapdoor in the floor, so you must move the AC after emptying the gray ones. They no longer let you spend the night in the parking lot next door. The police kick you out. It's a pity, because with this the city council makes us only go through there, but we don't spend anything in the local shops and restaurants, as we did before A bad municipal management"

Worse still is when you see the friendly races that are marked by rats parking. In an afternoon-night they delighted us with 5 different passes. Tip: it is better to go to the new free area. English: If you do not like rats, you'd better go to the free area."

It is our only interest to pay for a campsite, it is to take a good hot shower, but when the water is not hot and it is necessary to press every 10 seconds on a button to have the same pressure that we have in the camper ... well we are disappointed.

Otherwise nothing to say, well received, polite, kind owners are helpful, cleanliness reigns, sanitary are clean and if they smell a little urine from time to time it is not due to lack of maintenance but just because of urinals that some people use and leave without using the little button that you push you know the button called ""flush"". And for the motorhome all services are included."

Pool, spotless, large pitches, slight downside is a little road noise. If you are going through this area stop for a couple of nights run by a Dutch family, it is stupendous."

14615,3290384,5,Roetti77,12/09/2023,Solid place to explore Barcelona. We took advantage of the shuttle offered and took the bus. Prices ok.
14615,3288203,5,Clararkenciel,12/09/2023,We spent 5 nights at this campsite. The ACSI card allows a price of 25 € 60 for 2 people and a campervan. the campsite organizes return trips by bus which are extremely practical for visiting Barcelona. All visits can be booked through their website. Barcelona is easily visited by bike or scooter because there are so many cycle paths.
14615,3284257,5,Archelon5,11/09/2023,"Haven of peace when we spent the day in Barcelona. Swimming pool and dog friendly area, very good. The campsite bus or the free shuttle to Mataro train station take you to the center of Barcelona. The panoramic bus tour, red and blue circuits, are recommended to discover this beautiful city."
14615,3276966,4,PauloMerencio,09/09/2023,"Very good campsite, with good spaces for motorhomes, some with shade, a good swimming pool, restaurant, supermarket and up-to-date and clean sanitary facilities. The park offers a free bus to Mataró, every 30 minutes, where you can catch the train to Barcelona or go to the beach. There is also a direct bus service to Barcelona, but you have to pay for it."
14615,3269837,4,detleffs6768,07/09/2023,"Good starting point for a city trip to Barcelona! Friendly, helpful staff, good restaurant, small mini market with everything you need! Daily shuttle bus to Barcelona for €7.80 return! Free shuttle to the beach/train station! Unfortunately no beach access! Pool very warm! Large parking space, clean sanitary facilities! Overall we felt very comfortable!"
14615,3246642,1,lolojjo,01/09/2023,"we had a very bad evening, many bikers made a lot of noise, music, burned motorcycles until 1 a.m. despite several people complaining at reception with no reaction from management.. and everything that for 62€/ 2 in a van, elec. obligatory... to be avoided!"
14615,3244390,4,Adriennemossy,01/09/2023,"Very clean campsite, nice sized plots, clean swimming pool, restaurant on site and shuttles great. I agree the price is a bit steep but if you want a city break included with the beach, this is a great spot. Shuttle into Barcelona €3.90 each way per person, goes twice a day or the free shuttle to the train station and trains run directly into Barcelona every 10 mins around £4.50 each way."
14615,3235153,2,manuelcid,29/08/2023,"To be the only campsite in all of Barcelona, the price for a night in a supposed 4-star campsite seems to me to be a robbery: 63 euros, horrible small unseparated plots, we went to bed and the next morning we had a tent in front of the van. what was supposed to be my plot, the staff of the buses that take you to the center of Mataró a few edges"
14615,3222554,4,MilieBa,26/08/2023,"A little expensive for just 1 night in a van €51 for 2 adults but everything is fine and the staff at the reception is welcoming, speaks several languages and very patient I recommend"
14615,3166311,5,verojeje,17/08/2023,"Great. We were supposed to stay there for 4 nights and ended up spending 21 nights there. Very nice swimming pool, top and very attentive staff. The bosses, father and son, are super nice and very invested in camping and the well-being of campers. Free shuttle to the beach and the center of Mataro. We recommend without worries and will return next year."
14615,3160098,4,,16/08/2023,"The campsite is clean and even very clean. Toilets, bathrooms nice and kept clean. Animation service for children everything is in place. Restaurant, swimming pools everything works as intended. The campsite is heavily crowded with tourists. The downside of the campsite is access to the beach. It is a street crossing with no lanes on the road and then an underground passage under the tracks."
14615,3109821,4,DucatoOli,09/08/2023,"Positive points, multilingual reception, French included, plots of correct size, with water and drainage on each plot, swimming pool, children's activities, paid bus to Barcelona to be booked on the internet, free shuttle to Mataro all day, small supermarket, bar, bread The morning. Negative points, no access to the sea on site a lot of flies because of the nearby farm animals"
14615,3107079,5,anamer,09/08/2023,super campsite nothing to say but I'm not coming back July and August too many people I'm coming back in low season very clean campsite very nice maintenance staff and the gentleman at the reception very well I recommend the campsite
14615,3097497,4,KostaD,07/08/2023,The best solution to visit Barcelona. Otherwise the railroad is between camp and beach but they offer free shuttle that drive to public beach each 20 minutes. It’s a expensive parking place just for visiting Barcelona and spending night there but it’s really the best option compared to other camps around. Facilities are clean enough. The camp is full now but nights are quiet without noise
14615,3089225,4,lnf,06/08/2023,"Large campsite, well equipped and convenient for visiting Barcelona thanks to the shuttles to Mataró and daily bus connections to the city centre. Unattractive direct environment (railway and expressway between the campsite and the beach) but large saltwater swimming pool very pleasant after a day in the city."
14615,3087381,4,manuisa,06/08/2023,"Pleasant campsite for its proximity to Barcelona shuttles (subject to reservations) take you to the center of Barcelona and shuttles every twenty minutes take you to the beaches (no direct access from the campsite) and to the center of Mataró. we had a sea view pitch with water and electricity, correct sanitary facilities. Noisy at night around the pool and bar!"
14615,3078518,3,Zextra,05/08/2023,"Ideal solution with a camper to visit Barcelona. The return shuttle service is excellent! Busy if not chaotic campsite in early August. Few bathrooms, not very clean and too far from some pitches. They assign pitches after 12 but there is an internal car park where you can leave your vehicle."
14615,3072048,5,marionetyoann,03/08/2023,"All services available, clean sanitary facilities, train line nearby but does not run at night. A free bus service until 1am to get to the beach or the center of Mataro. We paid in a cc pitch for 2 adults and a teenager €140 for 2 nights in the middle of August. I recommend."
14615,3066190,3,jorileo,02/08/2023,positive points: ideal for visiting Barcelona with the paying bus which takes us directly to the city center in the morning and brings us back in the evening. the swimming pool is good. The dish racks are top notch. negative points: the size of the pitch that was allocated to us allowing everyone to just take out the table and the pressure and temperature of the water in the showers. conclusion expensive for what it is.
14615,3036676,5,katrinberger8,28/07/2023,"Perfect for exploring Barcelona! Daily shuttle bus! Sanitary facilities for Spanish standards top! We had a great place in the second row. Train line (doesn't run at bedtime!) between the square and the sea, so there was no direct access and no section of the beach! For that you would have to take the bus to Mataro. Pleasant live music every evening until 11:00 p.m.! We were very satisfied!"
14615,3029157,5,LienV,27/07/2023,"Very nice campsite. Away from the hustle and bustle of Barcelona, but ideal for city visits thanks to bus service. Swimming pool (with paddling pool) and playground were ideal for our kids aged 2 and 5. Clean sanitary facilities."
14615,3009808,5,AlexC.1975,23/07/2023,"Good location, used for 3 nights (off the ferry and as a base for visits to the surrounding area), convenient with bus service to Barcelona, clean and well organised, very kind staff. Excellent swimming pool to spend a few hours, perfect WiFi service as well as the restaurant and market, bathrooms in order and always clean."
14615,2992704,5,Pantocrator,20/07/2023,"Free bus service, very clean pool, apart from an employee at the reception who was somewhat scarce in giving us information while her colleague did it well with another client. Somewhat expensive but very good services."
14615,2983129,3,eyes3,18/07/2023,In itself a good campsite. But very noisy on the first 4 rows due to train traffic passing the train every 10 minutes and on a busy track. We were in the second row and could not sleep without earplugs. Their website is misleading camping not directly on the beach but 2 km away with their bus. we had booked 8 nights but left earlier. Restaurant good!
14615,2975430,5,MasGhi,16/07/2023,"We stayed for 5 days in pitches A with our camper, the campsite is very well kept, toilets always in perfect order, swimming pool ok and never crowded, the supermarket a bit small but with everything you need. The restaurant offers good food. Very special the bus services to the beach every 20 minutes until 1 am and a direct connection to Barcelona."
14615,2955924,4,tp1312,12/07/2023,"Good campsite, with clean sanitary facilities. Ideal for reaching Barcelona with the cheap bus that runs daily. There is also a free shuttle to Mataró. The campsite has a very international design. The homepage gives you all the important information you need to plan your short stay."
14615,2939058,3,jasmin0804,08/07/2023,"View of the campsite is good. But relatively expensive for €50 per night. Unfortunately WiFi is not good. Despite this we were right next to the reception. Yes, it's a bit loud, but there are also a lot of people here and we knew that it could be a bit louder. If we want peace, then we look for places other than large campsites."
14615,2928119,3,GKJJ,05/07/2023,"The place is good for passing through or visiting Barcelona. Relatively narrow and noisy as we found. The sanitary facilities are already pretty bad. years old and could be cleaner. The service is great, you have everything you need. There are even a few animals."
14615,2925216,1,JoKoni,05/07/2023,"Someone tried to break into our motorhome in the night. They didn't manage to get in, but they broke the side window. 

The camping is ok in general with a shuttle to Barcelona, no beach next to it, pool ok. But we came here for safety, not for the amenities. Very disappointed."
14615,2920177,5,krapulax,03/07/2023,"If you want to visit Barcelona, this could be your basic camp! Full equipped, even a chill out zone! Free shuttle to the beaches in Mataro and to the train station. Direct bus to the centre of Barcelona. AAAA++++"
14615,2917516,5,TielleDias,03/07/2023,"Excellent camping. All structure well maintained and clean, good bathrooms, good swimming pool. Various activities for adults and children. Easy access to Barcelona, if you need to go to the city outside the camping transport hours, you can use the trains that run frequently, the nearest station is approximately 1.5 km away. Camping staff very helpful."
14615,2907245,4,funnyhooks,30/06/2023,"A nice place, but also very narrow. The shuttle bus to the city only goes there in the morning and back in the evening! so no chance if you arrive after 10am.Shuttle to the beach runs more frequently and stops at a train station that takes you into town. Could use the pool extensively. Very neat place."
14615,2895685,5,roadtripLV,26/06/2023,"Super well maintained campsite, the staff are pleasant and make the effort to speak your language. The sanitary facilities are clean and the plots are spacious and shaded. The swimming pool is divided into two parts for people who just want to relax or play ball, which is practical!"
14615,2885987,5,Julez0803,24/06/2023,"By our standards it is already an expensive place if you only want to go to Barcelona (38€ a night). Connection to the city with the public and the shuttle very good. Are for 4.00 € each with the train at noon and at night with the night bus (stops right in front of the door) back. Had a quiet and shady place with our van. Sanitary facilities ok, but not nice."
14615,2882350,3,msbulli,22/06/2023,Very good for visiting Barcelona. Bus transfer from the campsite to the beach and to Barcelona. Otherwise more of a transit place.
14615,2871138,5,Biene6178,19/06/2023,Nice place to explore Barcelona or to stay overnight when passing through.
14615,2868648,5,lavud,18/06/2023,Beautiful campsite with swimming pool and above all a private bus that drops us off in Barcelona near Place Catalunya and picks us up in the evening. Top !!!
14615,2866017,5,Polux64,18/06/2023,"Perfect for visiting Barcelona with complete peace of mind, very well organized by the campsite. Correct with the Asci board. No complaints"
14615,2864301,5,MickeyMike,17/06/2023,"We only wanted to stay one night because of the bad reviews. We don't understand. Stayed 4 nights.38€/night, 2 people, camper with electricity. Super friendly staff. All you need. Sea view. We used the shuttle service several times. Absolutely to recommend. Just a sticky awning because of the trees at our site."
14615,2863289,5,LostKiwis,17/06/2023,Lots of showers and toilets. Great pool. Helpful staff. Easy access to city with bus or train. Mini market good value. Top site with ACSI card.
14615,2862113,4,kopin85,17/06/2023,"Very clean, all amenities are there. Too bad we are separated from the sea by the railway so there is a free shuttle to get there. Very well received (in French) and good advice. 47 € per night. A paying bus (-10€/p A/R) for Barcelona in the heart of the city. The places are well and shaded. Attention a lot of mosquitoes, even with the product we get eaten."
14615,2861645,5,caradokaracho,16/06/2023,"Can only be recommended, especially if you want to visit the city."
14615,2859521,2,lotusbluete91,16/06/2023,"Unfortunately we had some bad luck with our pitches. Places 3, 5, 7, 9 are not recommended, the trees are extremely resinous here. Unfortunately nobody pointed this out to us. There were also a lot of small animals on the pitch (we are used to a lot and not picky, but there were too many). It was almost impossible to sit outside without a few feet crawling up. Luckily we only stayed 2 nights and a full day in Barcelona. The connection to Barcelona is great and so is the pool area."
14615,2843228,5,hpadm,11/06/2023,"Super clean campsite, quieter when away from the road and the animals. Arrival possible until 11 p.m.! The bus shuttle to Barcelona in the morning and back in the evening (for a fee; book online beforehand!) works perfectly. Free shuttle bus to Mataro and the beach almost every hour also perfect. Large swimming pool. Everything is explained perfectly. WIFI works!"
14615,2814149,5,handball1979,03/06/2023,"Good connection to Barcelona, shuttle bus to Mataró or bus to Barcelona. fine. Sanitary facilities could be newer, but clean. The cleaning staff do their best."
14615,2796998,5,SergioPinar,29/05/2023,"We arrived in Barcelona on a Friday at 5:30 p.m. We fell here by discarding since the closest campsites were without quotas. Everything works well. It's nice to see many people with disabilities without any problem. It would lower the score by 0.5 by not having sands in front of the campsite, but free transfers to Mataro. they are excellent If you plan connections. 40 minutes to the center of Barcelona."
14615,2785137,5,JePi1,25/05/2023,"Straight pitches, nice communication, lots of amenities on site and great with the paid transfer to Barcelona."

14615,2782736,5,Pablo007,24/05/2023,Big busy site but you wouldn't know as showers very clean piping hot water and very quiet. Fantastic bus direct to centre of Barcelona for 3.90€ paid 23€ plus tax via Acsi card with one night free for a seven day stay.
14615,2767482,5,JMMarco,20/05/2023,very clean and quiet campsite. very professional and helpful staff. with onions for customers.
14615,2764715,4,CLAUDIOCORTO,19/05/2023,Good welcome. Clean toilets. Perfect for visiting Barcelona. Shuttle at the rate of €7.80 A/R to be booked on the campsite website which is very practical. For Mataro free shuttle every half hour to the station near the center.
14615,2764202,4,AhoernchenX,19/05/2023,"Very clean place, washrooms and rinse stations excellent. It's just a pity that the overhead lines of the railway line were retouched on the official photos. We booked a pitch with a sea view (more expensive) because of the WoMos in front of us, the view was completely obscured."
14615,2763799,5,JNoyez,19/05/2023,"Perfect camping to stay at it you want to visit Barcelona. Public transport, even night buses go to and from the camping. Also a free shuttle to the train station of Mataro. And a direct bus to and from Barcelona (twice a day). Clean facilities, quiet and spacious pitches. Ordered pizza take away from the restaurant one night. Definitely recommend!"
14615,2754159,5,phifi64,16/05/2023,"Already visited in 2019, I'm going back there soon on September 9, 2023, good campsite excellent for visiting Barcelona and relaxing on the beach."
14615,2737542,3,ahime,09/05/2023,We stayed two nights and wanted to visit Barcelona. Bus shuttle to Barcelona from the square for little money. No beach access. If I didn't want to visit Barcelona there would be no reason for me to stay there. Bathroom and parking space is okay but nothing special.
14615,2735992,5,StephMiCote,09/05/2023,"Great. you can't ask for better. All services are present. Lack of nearby beaches but very well served by a free shuttle and shuttle to Barcelona, all in front of the campsite. Good pitches but a bit narrow on some rows because of the trees but at least in the shade."
14615,2723167,5,tc303,04/05/2023,Very friendly welcome in all languages possible. Preferably a place as far away from the main road and train line as it is much quieter there. Nice wine tasting for free on Monday. Extremely good bus connection organized from the campsite to Barcelona with ticket service. Swimming pool very clean and small cheap supermarket. Ideal for sightseeing!
14615,2717308,5,phrd,02/05/2023,"Perfect. Good welcome (contrary to some comments), very well maintained sanitary facilities, practical and inexpensive restaurant, and ""icing on the cake"" a return trip by bus to the center of Barcelona for 7.80 euros, how to do better."

14615,2703772,4,CaroleetRaph,28/04/2023,"not 5 stars for the reception otherwise perfect station or Barcelona shuttle, clean toilets, small restaurant. ideal for visiting Barcelona"
14615,2700701,5,iobee,27/04/2023,Without much charm but very convenient for visiting Barcelona thanks to the direct morning and evening buses.
14615,2695606,5,wildehilde1994,25/04/2023,"Stood here 2 nights (as our tire was flat). Reception very friendly and helpful. 2 nights about 70 euros. Sanitary facilities in order. 'Standard' pitches are not very big but ok. Beach accessible on foot via a walk alongside the train tracks. Not as bad as it sounds, that seemed normal there! There is a way. Dog could also go to the beach there."
14615,2670570,5,Lady007,14/04/2023,"Ideal campsite for visiting Barcelona... Shuttles several times a day, it's a comfort not to have to worry about journeys... Quiet nights and very clean sanitary facilities..."
14615,2660000,2,AnikaDybowski,10/04/2023,"The lady at the reception seemed bored when she heard that we might only stay 1 night, we were offered a place right on the main street for €56. To get to the beach you have to cross the main road with a child. We drove straight on and found a great place for €34 with everything that goes with it. We won't come back here"
14615,2654677,5,28klara,09/04/2023,Super nice campsite; Staff speaks many languages and is super friendly. Sanitary facilities are ok. Great connection to Barcelona. We stayed one night to visit Barcelona.
14615,2653900,5,Wiederkucken,09/04/2023,"Very good, there are restaurants and supermarkets in the campsite, there is also a shuttle bus to Barcelona, round trip 7.8 Euros"
14615,2648323,4,vijobi,07/04/2023,"Great place to visit Barcelona. The shuttle bus only takes about 30 minutes to Barcelona. Very nice staff. The places are big enough. Unfortunately, you can hear the street and the train during the day, but that also depends on where you are. And unfortunately the wifi doesn't work. Maybe that also depends on where you are."
14615,2645656,4,Agavic,07/04/2023,"On April 7, the campsite is practically full...despite the 300 pitches. Sun, blue sky, facing the Mediterranean, what more could you ask for from Bretons who have come to relax in Spain. Pleasant French-speaking staff, restaurant, mini-market, fresh bread every day... and with the Acsi card €23 for 2 people with electricity. we recommend"
14615,2634126,2,SimoneGabriel,01/04/2023,"Space very expensive, sanitary facilities a bit outdated Bus shuttle to Barcelona very good Unfortunately no direct access to the sea And today there was loud shooting nearby for almost the whole day, which unfortunately our dogs didn't like so much"
14615,2629323,4,Wildapple,29/03/2023,"We stayed for two nights to take a trip to Barcelona. It was very convenient with the shuttle bus and you don't have to worry about anything else, very convenient for families. Staff very friendly and helpful. We got one of the smaller pitches, which would have been ok if the two neighbors hadn't parked their motorhomes right up to the border."
14615,2625438,5,LeMarc85,26/03/2023,"Perfect for visiting Barcelona. The shuttle buses take you to Barcelona and back 3 times a day. Directly to the starting point of the sightseeing bus tour. For 3.9€ pp per trip - perfect. Staff super friendly, German speaking. Places terraced, very clean and well maintained. Supermarket and restaurant on site. With ACSI Card in March for €24 (2P, 1 dog, electricity, wifi...)"
14615,2613096,3,BrigitteMorgenstern,17/03/2023,"Space is okay, but I wouldn't go there without a shuttle bus to Barcelona. No direct beach access and still quite expensive."
14615,2602993,4,vQtShZoXX6J9nCF,08/03/2023,Expensive but clean with good infrastructure. Connection to Barcelona regularly by train or by shuttle twice a day.
14615,2601487,5,Katka74,07/03/2023,"Elusive camping. All services great..., to combine a visit to Barcelona with relaxing by the sea..., this is an excellent choice. We will definitely come back here."
14615,2601146,3,saintamour,06/03/2023,Place with supplement with sea view or rather the CC opposite which has a view of the sea. I agree with the other opinions. Super busy road and the railway line between the campsite and the sea. Many services on site. In conclusion the only valid reason is the proximity to Barcelona.
14615,2599856,3,randal668416,05/03/2023,Good to visit Barcelona but expensive. Bus shuttle 2 adults and 2 children to Barcelona round trip about 30 euros. for us the place has no charm because of the busy road.
14615,2597796,4,sebandco,04/03/2023,"We spent 3 days there as a family with 3 children. The campsite is pleasant, the sanitary facilities are large, clean and heated. The bus to access Barcelona is very convenient for visiting the city."
14615,2597240,3,Papillon_34,03/03/2023,Large campsite but no possibilities to go to the sea on foot or to visit the city by bicycle. Ideal for visiting Barcelona by bus or train. Free shuttle bus to Mataro beach or center. We paid 35 euros per night for a standard pitch. This includes electricity 10A and WiFi. Sanitary facilities are good and are cleaned daily.
14615,2498111,5,FritzHerold,17/11/2022,"Been there in early October '22. Check in perfect and friendly. However, the pitches are small. With a 7m mobile it is just about possible to extend the awning. Not more. But it's OK, because few people will probably stay here longer. There are also larger or really big pitches that cost more. Plumbing is good and clean, nice showers. Shuttle to Barcelona is perfectly organized."
14615,2464314,3,zbar,27/10/2022,Good campsite for visiting Barcelona. The shuttle is really convenient.
14615,2464278,3,Buddycamper,27/10/2022,"Large campsite, very expensive, but everything fits. If you can afford that...I would only move to a parking space to visit Barcelona for one day, since you won't use the extras anyway, such as the pool....Check in and check out 12:00 p.m. Also not suitable for visiting Barca, because the own bus runs at 9:00 am and 10:30 am. So at least 2 nights"
14615,2461258,4,soffcamping,25/10/2022,"We were very happy with the campsite. In the low season we paid 34€ a night, which I found a bit too much. Showers and toilets were clean and centrally located. You could reach the sea directly and the employees were super nice and spoke pretty much every language. It was very quiet, despite the main road and train tracks in front of the square."
14615,2458938,4,NCLEB,23/10/2022,Good starting point for Barcelona. Very good shuttle bus to the city center and to Matarò even every half hour. Background noise due to the road still okay. Sanitary clean enough for a city camping. NOT to be recommended is the RESTAURANT. Loveless food from the fries to paella. Really really disgusting!
14615,2456942,5,campzig,22/10/2022,Great camping
14615,2456288,1,jimmyLongBombs,22/10/2022,"Horrible experience. I pray yours may not be bad as bad as mine. 

I’d have been better parking my van in a car park.  

This place really put a downer on what is a wonderful part of the world. 

Crowded, disastrous layout and unhelpful staff. 

Just avoid it."
14615,2444636,4,Home79,15/10/2022,"Ideal starting point for Barcelona. Very good shuttle bus 2x directly to the city center and back. In addition, a half-hour shuttle bus between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. to Mataró!! From there, the train runs every 20 minutes. Background noise due to the road in front of the campsite and the railway just about acceptable, at night i. O. Sanitary clean enough for a city camping. Poor sanitation."
14615,2438024,5,wackerbarth,11/10/2022,"Super place, super nice people and uncomplicated internet reservation for place and shuttle to Barca. It is advisable to reserve both. A tip for those who are sensitive to noise: do not book the first row with a sea view. It's only available from the skylight and it's unbearably loud from the train and street. We were allowed to move the next morning - thx."
14615,2434745,5,Rantzmica,10/10/2022,Excellent campsite for exploring Barcelona. Facilities good and good service at reception. ACI €22 comfort pitch
14615,2430443,5,sherlockmarsl,08/10/2022,Very nice campsite with sea views (depending on pitch). We paid €103 for 2 nights for an extra wide pitch. Booking through the website was easy and all the staff were nice. The sanitary facilities are quite large and relatively clean.
14615,2429534,4,nadineSH,07/10/2022,"Operator/employee very nice! The direct shuttle bus to Barcelona (bookable via the website) was great. Some of the pitches are very narrow and sandy. Sanitary facilities are okay! €46.64/ 2 nights (2 adults + van, electricity included + tourist tax, with ADAC discount) priced right!"
14615,2429141,5,MichelleCa,07/10/2022,"Very nice campsite. Reservation was uncomplicated, sanitary facilities are clean. The reception was very friendly, courteous and all employees even spoke German. There are donkeys, sheep and chickens. Bus to Mataro is free for the shuttle to Barcelona the ticket costs 4€. Small drawback you can hear the street and from time to time a train."
14615,2423771,4,Iza1987,04/10/2022,"Good campsite! Nice employee at the reception, clean sanitary facilities, good and fast organization (without prior registration). The shuttle service to the beach, train station and Barcelona is super convenient. There is a shop (very well arranged) and a restaurant. A small disadvantage is that the road and the S-Bahn pass very close to the campsite (you don't hear it everywhere)."
14615,2413405,5,SabineBrinker,30/09/2022,"Great campsite! Very good service, clean sanitary facilities, good organization. The shuttle service to the beach, train station and Barcelona is super convenient. There is a shop and a restaurant."
14615,2402875,4,Maren2606,25/09/2022,"We spontaneously visited the campsite for 1 night (end of September). The employees were very friendly and spoke various languages. We had a pitch with a sea view and a short walk to the well-kept sanitary facilities. The complex offers everything you need, including the pool. It takes 35 minutes by shuttle to Barcelona (approx. 15 euros; round trip). We paid about 33 euros including electricity."
14615,2387999,4,GarciaCarole,20/09/2022,Very good A little noisy because of the road and the trains. The campsite welcomes campers until midnight and takes the ACSI card 23.35 € (for tourist taxes) for 2 with motorhome trailer car carrier. Toilets and showers impeccable cleanliness and hot water Possibility to take a bus to BARCELONA or MATARO just in front of the campsite for a few euros We will definitely be back
14615,2382156,4,LaurentWhang,18/09/2022,"Very very good value for money. Pitches of a good size, flat. The sanitary facilities are impeccable. Very well located 30 minutes from Barcelona. Very pleasant welcome (in all languages). In the top !"
14615,2381418,5,finn9404,18/09/2022,There were two of us with our Bulli for 2 nights. The place was super nice and clean.
14615,2363122,3,omega800,11/09/2022,"Place nice but no beach access. It is in the neighboring village and can be reached by shuttle until 1:00 a.m. The return trip at 10pm only worked to a limited extent, at the beach H-point in Mataro the driver ignored us and left us standing. For the tickets for the BC bus tour, the best price is guaranteed at the reception, but the price was the same as on the bus line. Pitches ok but it is currently teeming with ants."
14615,2353418,4,ljmb,09/09/2022,campsite with a beautiful swimming pool. They have buses to go right to the center of Barcelona in 40 minutes. Expensive restaurant for the quantity served
14615,2348747,4,smile0803,07/09/2022,"Beautiful natural campsite, very nice staff, short-term booking was possible (beginning of September). Clean showers and toilets, small pool area to cool off. The sandy beach can be reached within 5 minutes with the free shuttle. Unfortunately, the restaurant on the campsite was very disappointing, we could take the food to our pitch, but it was very bland and the portion was not particularly large for the price."
14615,2344735,2,marienkaefer73,06/09/2022,"Price: €65 (2 people, mobile home, 2 nights, end of August 2022, including electricity) Sanitary facilities: Cleanliness/functionality good Beach: Can only be reached by shuttle or 20 minutes on foot Staff: Reception spoke good German Parking space: Not separated, no distance to the neighbors, no privacy, noise from neighbors at night"
14615,2343004,4,pkania,05/09/2022,"Free bus to Mataro, bus to Barcelona for 4Euro / person. Good base camp to go to Barcelona but it is generally busy place and full in high season."
14615,2335503,5,roobinen,03/09/2022,"Organised, people are polite and facilities are clean. The pool and free (good) wifi are a big plus. There are fresh and greywater connections on the parcels. Would totally come back again!"
14615,2327115,5,MarcelFischer,01/09/2022,"Super large campsite with a restaurant, pool, clean sanitary facilities, the sea right in front of you and everything a camper needs, we give it 5 stars and will definitely be back."
14615,2312153,4,vivi9,28/08/2022,"Given the negative comments on other campsites close to Barcelona, this is probably the best security/accessibility compromise for visiting Barcelona. Choice of transport: shuttle, train, night bus. Everything is perfectly explained by the staff. On the campsite, RAS. Correct no more. Avoid the supermarket, too expensive, bad bread."
14615,2291617,3,mmp2201,23/08/2022,"A bit too expensive in price and the sanitary facilities are also pretty dirty at peak times. (Depends more on the cleanliness of some guests) But the worst are the mosquitoes, which bite you all day due to the proximity to the fields. The staff is super nice and helpful. Therefore 3 stars!"
14615,2284470,5,aurelappius,22/08/2022,"Super friendly staff is at reception until midnight. We only arrived in the evening and were given a large space for our VW bus without a reservation. The shuttle goes to the center every day (reserve the evening before!) If you want to stay longer in the city in the evening, you have to return by public transport (approx. 1 hour) or a taxi."
14615,2265980,3,Xabi22,19/08/2022,Very convenient for visiting Barcelona with the shuttle bus. Dirty and clogged toilets. A little noisy in the lower part due to the road and the train.
14615,2227515,2,Aurelie8779,13/08/2022,"Very noisy roadside location with also the passage of the train every 10 min hence the 2 stars. Otherwise the staff is pleasant and helpful, you can visit Barcelona by booking your tickets 1 day before for the bus that leaves from the campsite and takes you to the center of Barcelona for 7€80 round trip per person, I recommend!"
14615,2214317,4,Goreiza,11/08/2022,"We have been three days and the attention has been very good. Large swimming pool, plenty of showers and acceptable cleanliness (sometimes the problem is not so much the cleanliness of the campsite, but rather the people who are very dirty). Wonderful shows at night. Cheerful. Large plot, fridge and even borrowed adapter and extension cord because ours was small. €273 5 adults, car, tent 3 days."
14615,2213794,4,foxandfocs,11/08/2022,"Appreciable campsite for visiting Barcelona. Shuttle system that drops you off at Place Catlunya in 30 minutes (book at least 24 hours in advance in high season). Free shuttle to Mataro beach, its city center and its train station. Otherwise we are still packed like sardines on the pitches and the pool is full of people."
14615,2210575,4,BjoernBjoernson,10/08/2022,"We got a nice spot at the end of the campground sorrounded by tents (good for small vans). Even though there was animation it was quiet. There is no beach close by but a small spot to swim if you are brave enough. Supermarket was not very good.
Great shuttle service right into the center of Barcelona (book the day before).
Clean. 3 nights (1 Van, 2ppl, electricity): 174,- Euros"
14615,2205133,4,AntoniJS,09/08/2022,"Strong points: the pool, it is ""pet friendly"", the restaurant, the shop, the free buses to Mataró, also the buses to BCN, the animal farm, the plots with water and light, shows at night 'August, wide streets and parking and services almost everywhere. Weak points: no beach, shop prices are high, bathrooms and showers lack cleaning more often."

14615,2181288,5,Milataci,05/08/2022,"Nice campsite with everything you need. Some sites are better and bigger, others less well located and smaller, but that's the case with a lot of campsites. In addition, you can go here for a maximum of 4 days, during which you will not be in the camp, but you will visit Barcelona. And precisely thanks to the organization of the visit to Barcelona, this campsite is far and away the best. Highly recommended, live music in the evening is a wonderful finishing touch to every day."

In June, the site was not full and the office were happy to let us swap to a different space that had better shade.  We were set back from the road a couple of rows so couldn’t hear any road noises. In the night you can hear the waves at the beach, which was lovely."

Friendly check in staff that spoke excellent English. Would definitely recommend this site."

The website is not at all what you find."

14615,1607402,2,fabsch,25/09/2021,"The place is clean and well maintained. Prices ok. However, popping noises can be heard in the evening until early in the morning. The place has probably had new neighbors for ~ 2 years who keep their fields free from (wild) animals. And that with a blank shot ?! Our dog, which was not bulletproof, was very scared. We had called especially if there was still shooting, like two years ago. That was denied. Too bad."

With the train for € 9.20 pp there and back, it worked out great. The next day we took the shuttle (9am / 7pm) for € 5.90 pp and we were even allowed to take our bikes with us. At the reception they spoke to us in German. With pleasure again"

In September there is a bus to Barcelona once a day from 9:00 am to 8:00 pm, € 5.50 per person, book in advance. There is a busy road between the campsite and the sea.

Trees give a bit of shade.
Great place to visit Barcelona."

The place itself is beautiful. Friendly staff and a large pool. The sanitary facilities are old but still in order. It is worth visiting Barcelona for 1-2 days.
14615,1554252,3,EmilyandJulien,06/09/2021,"Very good campsite with great facilities and friendly staff. Pool, bar, supermarket, restaurant, laundry... However the road and train line are right between the campsite and the sea - meaning constant road noise wherever you are. And there isn't a real beach. Ideal if you're just stopping for the night or discovering Barcelona (free shuttle bus). But not the most charming of locations."
14615,1521891,5,silvanoebettina,28/08/2021,"What to say…. Excellent welcome, dated but well-kept structure, clean and with well-sized spaces. We were given the seafront location, which was beautiful. Rail and road did not cause any disturbance. The entertainment is great and the heated swimming pool is beautiful. It's a shame that there is no beach in front but only a breakwater. Excellent connection with Barcelona!"

Sea views from the front rows. The only drawback - the campsite and the sea are separated by an expressway and train tracks, so there is no direct access from the site."

Bit cool for the pool but that’s open too. Everyone speaks English and on the ACSI section there’s plenty of room on the fully serviced pitches. Cost this month is 21€ per night all in, 33€ for non ACSI. The sea can be viewed from the site but the nearest beach is a good 20 minute walk, the main road is not great for cycling as it is very busy early morning & late afternoon. We’ve found it very relaxing as a place to stop over at on our way further South. We’ll be using the FREE shuttle bus into Barcelona before we leave."

Pool and plumbing are clean and fully ok but in the evening there is at least 5 hours to 23.00 loud karaoke and live music. The sea can be seen but between the camping and the sea is a busy road and the railway. As a fixture to visit Barcelona (the ""free shuttle"" is not free !!) but everything else - well ...

The staff was very nice, but the space with the pool is good standard, but not a top place (as the ADAC rated it in 2018). Little play equipment for children, very modest playground. At the front of the square is an arterial road plus railway line. Easy access to Barcelona, free shuttle to the train station and other places. But it is also directly a bus to Barcelona for 2.90 € pp and each way."

The cleaning staff work tirelessly keeping things in order as do the garden staff and the children’s entertainment. We stayed in May and then came back again in June/July and will most certainly be returning again. The only negative points are in May there were mulberries dropping everywhere and they were making such a mess, and in the summer the yellow flowers from the trees are the messy nuisance. Be aware, this can be a very noisy site depending where your pitch is, being near to the constantly busy road and train line but we got used to it."
14615,539171,4,ClaudiAlinaGregor,04/07/2019,"Very friendly staff, speak every imaginable language. The place as well as the sanitary facilities were clean. You do not have sea view in all places. If you choose the first rows you have a great sea view, you have to live with the traffic noise (busy street, railway tracks). The restaurant is okay but quite expensive. Washing machines are available, detergent is available in the mini market. The pool is quite large, but we did not find it very clean, in the corners formed on the surface of an oily slimy film. All in all, ok, but the price of 37 € is quite high."

The campsite is very well equipped and clean, although at this time of year (May) the mulberries dropping from the trees are very messy and a bit of a nuisance. The only negative point is that it isn’t possible to take a walk anywhere, only besides the train track which is really not ideal. The free shuttles to the beach and nearby Mataró town and the free bus to Barcelona make up for this though. Already booked our return stay for later in the year."
