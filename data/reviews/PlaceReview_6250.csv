80965,3071459,5,Marina97,03/08/2023,"Great, we spent a day to make a technical laundry stop, shower well, charge electronic things well. and we were very pleased. Afterwards, spend the day on the beach and finally, beer and tapas at the campsite restaurant. Super well priced and very good everything."
80965,2954238,4,ClaraBoia,12/07/2023,"Good camping place. The best about this place it's the fair price: 4,50€/ adult   7,50/van   2,15€ for electricity. The bathrooms are a bit old but clean! If the reception looks closed, you have to go inside the restaurant to ask for a place :) In general, a good place to spend the night"
80965,2577902,4,heinzanke,14/02/2023,The location is fantastic. We were here alone. look into the distance. The initial impression of having landed on a permanent camper place is wrong after we saw the places for mobile homes. We stand on the hill with a view of the swamp landscape. Toilets and showers are very clean. Very nice operator.
80965,2279138,4,Bruthian,21/08/2022,"Highly recommended for its location next to the Baldayo Marshes, more than correct family treatment, cleanliness and level plots. We went once and came back on our return. Also super reasonable in price, 16.5 euros for two adults and a camper van. We also recommend it for its restaurant, where we dined 2 nights."
80965,2043560,3,UteKolbe,06/07/2022,"Simple campsite with outdated but very clean sanitary facilities, nice operators, many permanent campers and dogs barking from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. from a caravan"
80965,1737243,2,TaniaenGalicia,19/01/2022,"It is simply an esplanade where you have your plot, quite full, we went in January, they close at 9pm. It is not a nice place. 4.50 per person, €7.50 per caravan and €2.15 for electricity. Easy access and friendly.Laundry by hand...no dryer...The showers are a luxury! Very clean and HOT water!! The lake in front very very beautiful."
80965,1688908,4,ottowinterskov,14/11/2021,"First of all, the campground is open.

80965,599652,3,Dounitch,04/08/2019,"Camping quiet family, sanitary correct against the use of showers is quite special. You have to get out of the cabin to press a button for hot water. Place extremely tight with a motorhome (6,30x3,10x2,5). Great restaurant for good eater and cheap."

80966,3148043,5,renskehoff,14/08/2023,"Friendly green campsite in the hills, with a beautiful large swimming pool & children's pool. Note, no playground. One of the better campsites of our trip with a nice view over the coast. The bar is great! Tip: order the signature burger As Nevedas. The owner speaks perfect English. Great places, not too big, privacy through hedges. Sanitary basic, lukewarm shower, but clean. A topper."

It has a super to get by in case you need something. Sometimes you pass by a campsite or area that we would like to spend more time but we had to follow the route, we had a week for the estuaries. You are noted for the next time. Thank you"

80966,2678558,4,Chilham,18/04/2023,"Lovely welcome and spotlessly clean facilities. Pitches on a slope. We stayed at a weekend so experienced locals coming and going at all hours, and rowdy kids making noise late in to the evening. Not a pleasant experience. Shame, as the site is okay."
80966,2648364,5,Hugo_official,07/04/2023,"We have not spent the night, there is the possibility of using only the showers for 3'50. It is a very good option if you go in a van without a shower. They have treated us great, in addition to giving us recommendations to continue visiting Galicia. That's how it tastes! we will be back."
80966,2640062,5,TraficJam,04/04/2023,"Great camping, we liked it here! Best/cleanest showers and toilets we've had in a month."

80966,2456324,5,Wurzelino,22/10/2022,"A beautiful campsite in a great Galician landscape. The English-speaking operators are very warm and friendly.

80966,2443056,2,pierredutrey,14/10/2022,"We just spent the evening there yesterday. The welcome is very warm and as far as camping is concerned, we liked everything.

Beach and village of Caion with port not far away. Superb walks or bike rides. Bar and bread and croissant service in the morning."
80966,2163299,5,selderfield,02/08/2022,"We stayed only one night and it’s a lovely site. Very friendly and helpful staff , long level shaded pitches , bar , supermarket and fresh bread and croissants in the morning. The helpful owner let me put my ice packs jn the freezer. If you have dogs -there are 2 easy to find -tracks just across the road that are safe for letting the dog run free ."
80966,2055311,3,CarinaDolezich,10/07/2022,"Small campsite with pool & bar, sanitary facilities clean, dishwashing & washing area dilapidated but adequate. The plots are spacious and partly shady, but in my opinion uncomfortable and noisy due to the hedges and long-term campers... 10 minutes by car to the nearest beach. Pay €23.80 for one person, car, tent & dog, I've camped nicer and cheaper."
80966,1783778,5,JLG06,15/03/2022,"Very warm welcome, beautiful plots and very quiet and clean. Very glad to find such off season campsites."

80966,1628644,5,Friedeke,05/10/2021,"Quiet campsite. Owners speak very good English and can offer endless ideas for exploring the area. Also have a lot of knowledge about it, beyond the usual facts. We will definitely come back!"
80966,1584230,5,felixgermany,16/09/2021,"A wonderful campsite! Super nice and lovable owner; you feel at home! Clean and newly painted sanitary facilities. You can see the daily cleaning. At the bar you can sit comfortably until 11 p.m. and drink beer, Tinto de Verano and other inexpensive drinks. The pitches are pleasantly separated from each other by the hedges and are mostly protected from the sun. You can also learn a lot about Galicia from the owners. Definitely to be recommended!"
80966,1499611,5,mserr386,22/08/2021,"Very simple but very clean, quiet and cozy, only 3km from the beach. Large plots. We had a great 10 days, the new managers are a very friendly family, being just getting better, for a couple of days they had issues with hot water, but they fixed it quickly. They make some spectacular burgers and pizzas. 2 adults, 2 girls, caravan with electricity 28 € / night."
80966,1462380,3,Justwalker,15/08/2021,"Apparently it's okay for a night if he catches you passing through. There was no hot water in the showers, nor was there after warning those responsible. To connect the light, it was necessary to maneuver between the user's belongings from another plot behind which the plug was located. The same to disconnect. Anyway, maybe there are those who have more ""luck""."
80966,1439753,5,albajordip,11/08/2021,"We are just passing through for the shower service. The owners were very friendly and the showers were very clean with hot water. They have a swimming pool, laundry, yoga and beauty classes."
80966,1422923,5,Rafikis,08/08/2021,"A family campsite, very green, quiet ... The family that runs it is charming and will help you as much as possible. An oasis in the middle of the road :)"

80966,1194887,5,ToKiBo,13/05/2021,"In autumn 2020 new owners took over the place and are now renovating it with a lot of love. The owners were very warm and helpful and deserved at least a 10. They speak very good English too. The place is not quite finished yet, but still beautiful. The sanitary facilities are already renovated and very clean and there is a hot shower at no extra cost."
80966,1184225,5,DonHerbie,03/05/2021,"Very nice and familiar campsite, stunning views from the new terrace, especially the sunsets. the treatment by the excellent management, we will definitely return in summer."

80967,2341905,3,DanCamper1F,05/09/2022,"A really nice place, but the WoMo should not be more than 7 meters. The disposal point for the chemical toilet is clogged up quite quickly. The gray water is emptied in a small gully with a cover in front of the sanitary area, so it has to be targeted, or you have a hose with you for the outlet. Paramedic everything is clean and ok. We fit the medium-sized pitches exactly with 6.30 meters. But there are also larger spots on the sides. Laid out as a terrace, the view of the bay is great."
80967,2254843,5,laraymarcos,17/08/2022,"Super friendly staff, and always willing to help. Wide access for an AC of 7 meters. Wide plot. All services and facilities well maintained. Reasonable price. Highly recommended. Beach 5 minutes walk."
80967,2239687,5,lokibordercollie,15/08/2022,"Simple campsite, but very clean. With very good views of the Betanzos estuary. The couple that runs it is very nice and friendly. They recommended places to go with a dog in the area. The bar at night has a lot going on, but at 0:00 there is absolute silence and you can rest perfectly. It is very close to La Coruña and excursions to do on foot. It is a place to repeat."
80967,2207025,5,mariellefla,09/08/2022,"Excellent family campsite with very welcoming owners, very clean sanitary facilities. Beach at 500 m (beautiful lift). Well organized pitches. Do not hesitate to ask for information from the owners who speak French and Spanish and who are very good advice. A Coruna is 30 min by car. To recommend without hesitation.

The cafeteria is now Latara, ideal for dinner or a drink. Be careful if you go with Google Maps because it can take you by forbidden direction, you have to go straight and it already recalculates the route well."
80967,1466125,5,celinem71,16/08/2021,"Small charming campsite run by a French couple who will take care of you. Very clean showers and toilets. We radiated all around to visit La Coruña, Saint Jacques and Pontevreda and enjoy the beaches at the end of the day. The nearby town of Sada is authentic full of shops and restaurants. An excellent surprise."
80967,1036190,5,Otromundoaparte,09/09/2020,"Perfect camping if you want tranquility. We only spent one night, the owner was very attentive, the atmosphere was very good and the most important thing in these times when the bathrooms are very clean! I took a shower that tasted like glory! Due to the circumstances of the Covid, the bar was not open, but a little higher there are a couple of them."

80968,2074625,3,mondeperfect,15/07/2022,"The facilities are simple and old, but everything is very clean. Very friendly staff. The plots are fair in size, but well maintained. The worst: the children running and screaming throughout the campsite until 12 at night or more, without any respect for the rest of the others. 2 adults and van: €20"

80970,2019851,2,capu49,28/06/2022,it's a super quiet place really pretty and the water available is one more problem the Saint Bernard we were with a cat and he almost killed her trying to have fun with it I do not recommend for those who travel with a cat animal
80970,1701113,4,ArthurTaylor,01/12/2021,"Beautiful and very quiet, spent a great night. Downside: there was a huge, freely roaming, St. Bernhard dog who wanted to make friends and we were a bit scared and did not want to leave the doors open, because we did not want him to jump in."
80970,384255,5,neredgar22,29/09/2018,Very nice place in the middle of nature. There's no noise. Very pretty. Ideal to spend the night. You have to put mosquito nets because insects come in.

80971,2159127,5,Bernardette,01/08/2022,"We loved this canping. The family that runs it is charming and keeps it in very good condition. They help you with directions to the area. We went to the Caaveiro Monastery by a GR from the same campsite. It is a somewhat demanding route, but it is worth it!"

The bathrooms in general are very old, you shower in the dark and the water has almost no pressure, but it comes out hot without a problem. It cost us €18/night for a camper with 2 adults without electricity or anything. It does not have to load and unload water."

80971,1410551,1,anacaay,05/08/2021,"We come several vans and motorhomes. They give us a different price for each one, with a lot of disparity. The shower is not hot half of the time, we have to shower several in the motorhome. Then they tell us that they do not have gray water service or water recharge. Total I come with two children, a motorhome and electricity and I will pay 30 euros for not having any service."
80971,1387476,5,MjoseOlivares,31/07/2021,"Camping in the middle of nature, 20 minutes by car from Fragas de Eume, a highly recommended route. It has a swimming pool and the pitches are good size."

Popular with the locals this is a hidden gem, perfect for families and old retired folks like us.  So nice we are spending another night.  Spotless bathrooms, friendly owner, good social room and bar.  Highly recommend!"

80972,3194024,4,GretaBianchi92,21/08/2023,"Higher price than other campsites (60€ high season). Many different pitches with shade, on grass, with light or free. I give 4 because our pitch was in a great location. Very few bathrooms and showers but staff always present to clean and also to manage. Supermarket with high prices and just the bare minimum. Mediocre bar/restaurant. Unforgettable location!!!"

The choice of space is chaotic and if you drive away, it can happen that the parking space is gone. More than two nights were not possible for me. Unfortunately I cannot recommend it. And the waves there were tiny."

So yes the prices are prohibitive compared to the services! But no one is forcing us to go! We paid without electricity 72.00 euros 2 people a CC 2 dogs 2 nights. Free pitch, in fact wild camping but paying. Draining not great!"

Unpresentable, dirty, old, barbecue area between plots, plots and dry trees, they throw the shower water on the beach, it smells horrible, a lot of people crazy about surfing, if it weren't for the beach it would already be closed. Not recommendable."

Camping is very chaotic and if you're lucky you can squeeze in between others on uneven soil. No warm water and old facilities. Don't recommend."

Definitely not worth it!"
80972,2097957,3,ajorquesv,20/07/2022,Large campsite with direct access to the beach. In high season it is difficult to find flat and shady pitches.

We entered on a Friday at six in the afternoon and left on Sunday at five and they charged us three days. Not recommended for motorhomes, you can see that they do not like them. A pity that it is in the hands of poorly educated people who have no idea of running a business because the location is very good."

81053,1683221,5,Friki3,09/11/2021,"The area is fantastic. Castronuño is beautiful. It is worth going to the Mirador de la Muela and doing the Almendra route. At the Town Hall, when you go to pay, € 5 with electricity will provide you with information about the area. The view of Duero lifting the fog is priceless. And yes, only home vehicles. I think it is appreciated. You avoid seeing the showers and cooking outside the vehicle."

We have spent two very quiet nights here. 5 min away from the town with a bakery, butcher shop ... and an artisan cheese shop with 100% natural sheep cheese, delicious. Very friendly people.

The owner of the Guacamayo restaurant explained everything to us wonderfully and we even had dinner in his restaurant with a beautiful garden and an exquisite lamb.

81053,1080279,4,Burgwasser,03/10/2020,"Parking space has probably had no visitors for a long time. That's probably why it's neglected. The entrance for large vehicles takes getting used to. But once you get there, you stand quite nicely with a great view."

81053,402161,4,jumaolda,01/11/2018,"Dangerous Area, I mean: As services and electricity a 10. But it is located behind 2 chalets, to enter the area, they have removed the access to the garage to the neighbor of the left house. The problem is reflected in the anger of these owners against the campers. Yesterday at 1 o'clock in the evening the AC damaged us throwing stones and quinces."

81271,328206,4,IsaduPerigord,12/08/2018,"Complies with the description. We parked 2 RVs all day until late at night after taking our bikes to the beach and visiting Sitges. RAS on our return. So, rather safe parking. Gray water drain full of water made without problem. Do not stay for the night because roadside important movements related to the operation of the station."
81342,3189784,5,JeanVin,20/08/2023,Beautiful quiet place. We spent a magical afternoon and night there…
81342,2399383,2,Ivandb,24/09/2022,"Stayed here overnight to be a bit safer while a fairly heavy thunderstorm passed. That was also the only advantage of this place, there is a lot of waste, seems to be a popular place."
81342,2192146,2,Debuchh,07/08/2022,"Place with a lot of people during the day (maybe only in summer), not necessarily frequentable, we are not going to spend the night here in the end, we are not reassured"
81342,1700213,5,Leonhymer,29/11/2021,Very unusual place and very quiet.
81342,788670,4,VanLifer,29/02/2020,"Great place to spend the night with a nice view of the Santa Ana Dam. It is also a good starting point for multiple hikes above the lake. Negatives, quite dirty and there is a telecom antenna right in the parking lot"
81342,381796,3,Irma333,25/09/2018,"A quiet and beautiful place but full full of trash, piss papers and human poop. The night I had a good time but for the day you saw everything is a dump."
81362,1074989,3,KeyserSoze,29/09/2020,"Used for the meal break. Lots of tables, too bad for the litter lying around and the condition of the installations (2 taps out of 5). But we were able to fill up with water even at that time"
81362,597406,1,bennrr,04/08/2019,"Dirty, smelly and noisy, people use it all night and there's a dog barking. Won't come back."

81371,2662674,4,mayakalbo,11/04/2023,"Calm place. We were accompanied by the sound of water and sheep in the nearby pasture. There were fishes in the water, but the rocks on the waterfall wasn't very clear and there were some bones at the top of the cascade. Dogs drank the river water, bathed in it and everything was fine. Private hunting area, nothing happened to us, but it's better to be careful."
81371,1682317,3,patrick64,08/11/2021,"only one place otherwise it's quiet. Attention medium access especially for coaches (Difficult to turn around). Be careful in the event of a thunderstorm, do not stand near the river."
81371,1482224,3,vieuxjames,19/08/2021,One location in the shade of the trees. Without direct view of the stream but very close. It is better to scout on foot to find out if there is anyone. Otherwise the maneuver to make a half-TASTE is delicate or even it is necessary to make 1/2 turn.
81371,1446204,3,T4Tarragona,12/08/2021,"Good place to spend a quiet night on flat ground, without anything special. No services. River water not very clean."

81371,314322,5,lealadoux,04/08/2018,"A little difficult to find the place, the GPS did not bring us directly. But once it is difficult to leave. Super nice easy access, take the last road before the road to Lamata. At the edge of the water, a bath in the morning. Some locals who come to bathe around 13h. Absolute tranquility!"
81371,291494,5,paul1125,17/07/2018,"Very nice place !! Transporter size ok, with low water you can drive with a four-wheel drive on the other side of the river, there's a lot of space. thanks for the tip"
81371,287972,5,MelaetRo,13/07/2018,"Idyllic place, be careful in case of rain, the water rises very quickly, do not park in the river bed, a small storm and mudslides run down the river."

81393,2361718,2,ruebelbaer,11/09/2022,"nice place, unfortunately a lot of mosquitoes and young people with loud music. we drove on to Carcastillo, only passable up to 3 tons. Otherwise about 3km gravel road, a bit annoying"
81393,2266074,4,charlessp,19/08/2022,"Great spot for this rest for several days, river right next to it perfect for swimming, flat land the only black point ⚫️ it's the number of people who don't pick up their toilet papers there are everywhere, while there is a trash at the entrance !!!"

81393,1962399,4,laurinegtr,09/06/2022,Super spot at the top despite the passage of locals who pushed the sound system a little too loud. River that allows swimming. Mosquito repellent should be provided. Peaceful night and very cool place.

Lots of ""pollen"". It falls from the trees and it goes into the van. a little boring but we get used to it. bumpy path, stony road."

81393,1408520,5,Canocampers,05/08/2021,"Spectacular site, you have to go on the dirt road 3 or 4 kms but it is wide, it is worth it, the application took us correctly, we were with the motorhome and perfect."
81393,1293690,1,ViviCarballo,03/07/2021,"It seems that we have not been in the same place, there is no grass, totally dry. You cannot bathe in the river because it is too mighty. From the town the passage of vehicles of more than 3 tons is prohibited so the entrance is made where the navigator takes you, 3 kms of dirt track."

81393,676806,3,FamilleOurs,04/09/2019,"Full of mosquitoes. The road from the north is much easier to reach, by the other we had to make stone bridges to pass our camper. The place may look nice but a little creepy too (alone on a stormy night)."
81393,659481,3,zoeyexplo,25/08/2019,"Location really nice but I do not recommend to sleep in August infested with mosquitoes. Unless you have a very good repellent. Attention running strong enough, swimming impossible for children"

81393,511743,5,FabricedeNice,11/06/2019,Excellent place where I stayed for one night. In the middle of nowhere. No (or few) mosquitoes in early June. The road from the north is longer but in very good condition compared to the south!
81393,479994,5,ggio,09/05/2019,"Very nice place. Be careful with a team, do not arrive from the south from the city. The track also makes it possible to arrive from the north: it is much longer but absolutely without problem."

81455,1771068,4,LoukaBerjot,02/03/2022,"Not easy to access, the bend is really tight. We did it in reverse so we didn't have to turn around. Otherwise very nice area, little traffic, they added a basketball hoop but we cut the water taps."

81455,291668,3,melanjer,17/07/2018,"Aire that looks rather nice attention however a little difficult to access with a large campsite because we went with a 7 m, the mandatory half turn was tricky but successful! some goats at the bottom of the field but beautiful barbecue and water available!"
81462,3272286,3,SarGue,08/09/2023,"A nice campsite in itself, close to the beach and the pool area was great! Sanitary facilities were clean and the baby bathtub, which also had sanitary facilities for the men, was ideal for us with babies! The negative is definitely the environment! Right next to the campsite is a shooting range from which gunshots can be heard late in the evening and in the morning the wind blows the stench of the composting plant to the camp."

81462,3149059,4,chemadcai,15/08/2023,"Very good camping, in general. A little out of control with the plots. When we arrived, they told us to go and see if there were free plots on foot, that they were very full and they didn't know if we would have places... In the end we found a place, and very well. Next to the beach, we slept with the noise of the sea in the background. The huge and beautiful beach. Lots of mosquitoes. In general, we liked it."
81462,3115347,1,Denet,10/08/2023,"A shame. We entered the plot and our wheels sank. They didn't help us, just for us to call a tow truck. The campers helped us a lot, but by being so buried we couldn't. They could notify We went to another one that had louvered pitches to avoid it. A shame"

81462,2922131,5,Mareike232,04/07/2023,"We didn't expect that from the description and the reviews - it's a super campsite with all the necessities such as a pool (even quite warm with 26 degrees incl. baby pool), nice playground, mini market, restaurant, washing machine, dryer and children/baby toilet /sink/bathtub.. and the best thing is the direct beach access to the huge, little-visited beach, super great!"

81462,2806534,4,Paule30629,31/05/2023,"A very open space without many trees. Therefore hardly any shade. The sanitary facilities are clean, there is a restaurant and the beautiful beach is a stone's throw away."
81462,2782164,4,BerndHarbrecht,24/05/2023,very nice and clean place with direct access to the sea. with pool unfortunately neither on foot nor by bike a possibility to see the city. 23 € with Acci card too expensive for the location. but only our opinion
81462,2748525,5,Tornie,14/05/2023,"The best of four Orbitur courses we've visited this year. Very clean, marble fittings in washrooms. beach access. Unfortunately it was very stormy, so we didn't use the beach. Washing machines, tumble dryers and clothes lines available. Good place to visit Coimbra."
81462,2742488,2,MrToretto,11/05/2023,"Not really nice. But first the positives: the sanitary facilities are neat and well maintained, the staff is very friendly and helpful and the direct location on the beach is also very nice. What we didn't like at all is that it's more or less a large, sandy meadow. Not a big tree, hardly any vegetation except for a bit of brown grass. A pretty desolate place"
81462,2734826,2,moshemeged55,08/05/2023,The shower is the only thing that we liked. The place for the tent was very uncomfortable it was very spiky and ruined all of our camping equipments and there was a lot of snails all over our staff when we woke up. Super expensive for this kind of experience
81462,2698787,4,chregu83,26/04/2023,Everything you need is there. Nothing going on in mid-April. There is a direct path from the square to the beach. WLAN simply in the entrance area. Could freely choose the place. ORBITUR standard.
81462,2697364,4,cristinavil,26/04/2023,Well equiped and very clean. Paid 19e per night for MH and 2 adults. No shadows because trees are still very young and small.

81462,2612871,4,CarmEn2023,17/03/2023,Right on the beach with access. Bit sad in the off season. But everything is there what you need. Prices for washing and drying are exorbitant (6 € each) and everything has to be paid for with small change.
81462,2597942,2,PHP,04/03/2023,"Sad campsite, far from everything, without any charm. Very mixed reception! That's all!"
81462,2552246,2,Patrickbarra,15/01/2023,this campsite burned down in part in 2017 there are no more pines the pitches are small for a cc and risk of silting up beach accessible on foot 5 minutes away swimming pool convenience store provide mosquito repellent expensive price 1 cc 2 adults 1 dog electricity 34 euros per night in high season not justified

Restaurant food good. Children's park, tennis court, basketball, exit to the beach. Very clean, spacious bathrooms and everything in general very well, recommended. We had children's cinema. Orbitur rates within normal"
81462,2270716,2,waxy,20/08/2022,"Plots (supposedly the best) with an incline that didn't even fit the AC in an acceptable way. In addition, the ground is sandy with the risk of getting stuck. Camping staff not very friendly or attentive. We stayed 6 nights and we wanted to stay another one but the management seemed so difficult that we preferred to leave. The positive of the site, its location. A stunning beach on the doorstep"

Located in a very quiet area directly behind the wide beach, you can hear the sound of the waves day and night. The majority are locals, the atmosphere is totally relaxing. Sufficient and 3 times a day cleaned sanitary facilities/washing facilities, very nice staff. A small minus point is the dry, sandy/very prickly ground."

81462,1944215,2,jacqies,04/06/2022,"The good reviews of this campsite let to a small disappointment on our side. It is simply a large beach camping with many bungalows and permanent caravans. Yes, clean showers and toilets and also beach access. The latter goes by a gate which closes as early as 8 Pm. Swimming pool has restrictive opening hours."
81462,1887557,5,curdinho15,13/05/2022,"One of the best campsites we had in Portugal! Free choice of pitches (low season), direct access to the beach, very clean sanitary facilities and a view of the dunes. The price of around €20 per night was also okay."
81462,1858646,4,Naedz,28/04/2022,"I was only there for the shower. I had to pay 5 euros (daily rate for visitors) but it was worth it to me. The sanitary facilities were well maintained, the shower was warm and I had everything to myself. I can't say anything about the place. The woman at the front desk was nice. But she also said that this is not possible in the high season, as there is a lot going on. One star less just because of the price."
81462,1800146,4,Eckeschneck,29/03/2022,"Very nice campsite with short, direct access to the sea. we stayed here for a week and felt comfortable. Very clean, with all the trimmings and not very busy at this time in March. We were often alone on the extensive beach.

The shooting noise was unbearable for us and our dog, who panicked."

81462,1212698,1,fariafamily,23/05/2021,"Bad value for money, the internet doesn't take the space reserved for motorhomes. Everything was out of order including the park for the kids and the site was in working order. It is far from everything and the internal market has nothing and what it has is quite expensive. However, the bathroom is very clean. The city park for camping is much cheaper."

81462,598443,2,laikatita,04/08/2019,"I returned to this park after being here and enjoying it a lot. But this time I was disappointed. The shadows almost disappeared with Leslie. But worse was finding many poorly manicured, overgrown plots that looked like abandonment. An Orbitur-branded park should be more careful with its facilities. For the rest nothing to point out. It is waiting for the pines to grow back."

81484,844972,5,vgcn,02/07/2020,"Accessible and very quiet place for the night. During the day, a tree provides shade, and makes it a very good, almost perfect place. In addition, access to the lake is a real plus, a small morning swim is compulsory!"
81484,681804,4,Pattiam35,08/09/2019,"Isolated and very quiet place. A little passage on weekends (some fishermen). So that this place remains preserved and our presence tolerated, do not hesitate to pick up some rubbish around your camp even if they are not yours. Little tip, the little bag to go do your needs. Even though toilet paper is biodegradable, it's always cleaner not to have it behind all the bushes."
81484,530613,4,VanDeVacas,27/06/2019,"The road is a bit complicated, I do not think a motorhome or large volume can go down quietly. The environment is indisputably alternative. Nudist area."
81484,402426,5,baladeur74,01/11/2018,"For the amateurs of space there is what it is necessary, possible to go down all along the way, narrow by place but I passed with a 6.30 m at mid-slope, there are large esplanades who actually serve a festival"
81484,295331,5,joycolin,21/07/2018,"Amazing spot right next to the lake. We had no trouble getting down here in our extra long wheel base van. No services.

We were robbed during the night here, too. In a very elegant way. The went through all the locks, took a little cash and my manicure. But did not break anything and left my cards and passports folded neatly behind the wheel. We did not hear or feel a thing."
81490,1876336,5,sunjay,08/05/2022,"We spend 2 days here. Nice view, next to ocean, very calm at night. Felt safe because of supermarkets nearby. Toilets at McDonalds (open 11:30-23:30 h) or lidl. Beach showers 5 minutes away. Ideal to take train or bus for day trip to Barcelona. Parking was free. From the first of June to the 30 September you can only park for 1 day there."
81490,869609,3,Buda_790,14/07/2020,"Sleep ok. Near the beach, there are some trucks, a MC Donald nearby, generally quiet, you can hear the cars on the general road a little but if you are not very tikismikis everything is fine"
81490,581370,4,maksimus3,28/07/2019,"Stopped at the parking lot store Lidl. Of the amenities there is a toilet in McDonald's. There are stones on the shore (located across the railway), but there are islands of sand and stones where you can swim. We need to go to a normal beach (about 500-100 meters), we did not go. In principle, you can spend the night, but it's better to go to a more beautiful place."

If you’re into cycling or hiking you will not be bored, and the spot is truly fantastic. We were there alone for 2 nights, for the 3rd night another van joined us. There are some cyclists or hikers passing by, but barely any cars. If the spot is taken you can find more places to park in the gravel road that is right around the corner. Thank you for marking the spot!"

A few passing cyclists and the occasional car, but nobody bothered about the mobile homes. Of course, this only works as long as you behave respectfully, take your rubbish with you, etc., but that should be a matter of course anyway."

There's a large area right by the road, plenty of space for a few vans although I was alone all night. The road is very quiet. Fell asleep to the sound of owls hooting. If you follow the track behind the ruin there's another area further along but the track is a bit rocky and didn't fancy taking my van over it."

We spent one night there, but before sleeping in view of the conditions we decided to move to a parking lot a little further on. Although in the app it is marked as day parking, we slept three vans and the police came by early in the morning and did not say anything to us. There are about 100m between one parking and another.

There are fishermen who make a bit of noise at night. And there is a lot of garbage and toilet paper because there are no garbage cans! However, I recommend this car park because the street is not very busy and it is quite easy to access"
81554,1153738,5,vanlifegirl,19/03/2021,"Good for one night. The police drove past four times, that made us feel safe. Unfortunately there was a lot of toilet paper lying around, so again the reminder to take your rubbish with you / just clean the places."

The pebble beach is used by surfers, and a lovely walk/ride to the little harbour along the cliff path/road or back on to the N340. Perfect place."
81554,392167,5,Jmarn,12/10/2018,"Very small car park occupied by cars during the day and very narrow road to get there. Avoid with a big CC (lucky for us out of season), but Ok for a small van. Otherwise the place is superb with its cliffs and small coves that succeed. Very beautiful coastal hike to the cliffs to the south and beautiful bike path along the coast to the north."

81590,1131465,2,petyametya,18/01/2021,"This spot was too hard to reach because the road was muddy. Apparently, some people made an open fire there and left a lot of debris, which isn't great. Tissues and bottles lying around as well. Humans just make me sad sometimes. 
The spot is hidden away but that also means it's shady so we stayed at the one nearby."

The services work like a charm and there are light sockets supposedly working and free (do not check more).

It is a dirt road and you can choose many places to stay as there is a lot of grass around. We went with a large Sprinter van and we could access it very well.

81705,981877,5,rabbittine,19/08/2020,"Thank you very much for this magnificent place, we followed the small path a little more, to find ourselves in the middle of nature. A magnificent view of the 360 ° around you. On the other hand, please take back your little pee papers, to keep the magic of this place."
81707,1814269,4,laspescadillasviajeras,10/04/2022,"Super good , they only accept coins of 1 and 2 euros but they have a machine that changes but only for bills . The machines have an option to stop so you don't spend time cleaning or going upstairs"
81707,1204201,4,isaway,17/05/2021,"Super practical, € 1 for 3 minutes in clean water, 2 minutes in hot detergent water. money changer, takes 1 and 2 € coins"
81707,427093,4,jessy74,06/02/2019,Thanks for the tip !!!
81765,1103875,1,arracuu,24/10/2020,"Very quiet and secluded place, but in the middle of the morning the Civil Guard came to warn us of a very good roll that we were in an aerodrome where we could not be."
81765,1070334,5,katxie,26/09/2020,"Super quiet, and beautiful view, easy to access."
81765,1055406,5,pp07,18/09/2020,"Very large, flat, easy-to-access lot, very quiet."
81765,614564,4,susip,10/08/2019,"For sleeping in places like that we have a motorhome. The isolation is total. Very nice. Anyway, we must know that the access road narrows as you get on the airfield and that can overwhelm you with a large vehicle like ours."
81765,551705,3,angelamaniaa,13/07/2019,"It is pure nature and nothing is heard, but there are no shadows, only some trees but you have to stop in the middle of the lane. I imagine it will be very cool at night. The area is very quiet. There's no water."
81765,489071,5,tsubibox,21/05/2019,We have had a great night
81765,440853,5,atos1,17/03/2019,"In the middle of nature, quiet and clean. Many flat spots at 800m. As in many places here the smell of pigsties, is now nature! Nevertheless a pleasant spot. Follow the signs Aerodrom."
81765,438243,5,kristine1960,09/03/2019,"Huge dirt land quite isolated, no service"
81765,438239,5,kristine1960,09/03/2019,Huge old airfield place with a beautiful view
81809,3272765,5,Agust1960,08/09/2023,You enter a good path for a 680 like mine. At least today many free places. You can reach the beach via wooden walkways...water...super fine sand and you can easily get there by walking to the next beach. Corme is seen on the right.
81809,1353211,5,uxucousillas,23/07/2021,"It is where we sleep every summer. Always without problem, with the beach and nature next to it. Also source of drinking water."
81809,1164546,5,Beamazia,02/04/2021,"We have spent the day and magnificent. They were cleaning the whole area around the parking lot, so I was worried. Highly recommended, especially with children."
81809,1160760,2,lesocha,29/03/2021,"We had to leave. The park was inaccessible, all muddy. The asphalt of the parking lot also filled with water. It is as if water fell from a spring."
81809,1013915,5,nicosangrador,30/08/2020,"We have slept here with a large AC and a Camper van has accompanied us. The local police passed by and told us that it was possible to spend the night without problem. Children's area and beach, with bathrooms."
81809,859150,3,invall,10/07/2020,Next to the beach. Little room
81809,383159,1,colourmad,27/09/2018,Got robbed here. During daytime. Went for a walk and came back to an emptied van. 2018 Sept 26.
81809,331185,5,Nanin,13/08/2018,"GREAT! We have spent 3 nights, going to other beaches and going back to sleep, and no problem. Source, showers, picnic and, I suppose only in summer, portable toilet. At the entrance to a beach with the whitest sand I have ever seen. Take care, advice, do not occupy more than 5 or 6 seats, it is the parking lot of the beach and this one is quite frequented by the neighborhoods. Make fire, unforgivable! Enjoy!!"
81848,3010624,4,pouce77,24/07/2023,"This is the most accessible and non-disturbing place we have found in the area. Even if the view is a little less breathtaking than elsewhere, the night is very calm. A few car passes but nothing more. And the cemetery nearby, therefore a water point."
81848,767255,5,MaxGemperle,11/01/2020,Thanks for this place. There are almost no places in this difficult area.
81898,3213494,5,Geriacamper,25/08/2023,"We arrived at 20:30 good welcome. The pool is also open at night from 9:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. Very nice and warm, with a jacuzzi. Price per night: €40 for three people, motorhome and light. The bathrooms very clean. plenty of shade and pitches with artificial shade as well."
