24142,3043607,4,nerenaranjito,30/07/2023,We have spent the night without problem together with another van. Very nice views over the reservoir and quiet. Leave everything clean and if tables and chairs are not removed I suppose there should be no problem.
24142,3031222,1,kenykev,27/07/2023,"Very beautiful spot but unfortunately impossible to stay, natural reserve. La Guardia civilia came and took pictures of vehicles and ID and asked us to leave."
24142,2737902,5,Maverick150793,09/05/2023,"Superb place, a little windy and a little cool, went there in a Dacia Logan for the night, passable path, no toilets or ultra-pleasant showers. Uncrowded and not disturbed if you are already there we leave you alone."
24142,2705847,5,420chiller,29/04/2023,"Nice place with great view of the lake! Be careful when entering the gravel road, there are huge potholes right at the beginning, so don't go too fast! Street is very quiet, day and night."
24142,2581946,5,sebok,18/02/2023,no service but a just splendid view
24142,2428822,3,IluminaRopa,07/10/2022,"Had first approached other places on the lake, but then drove back to this one because of the ban. It's quiet and the view is nice"
24142,2289643,2,silviasolea,23/08/2022,"Currently access from the road is complicated, the terrain is very rough and with the slope it is difficult to get out, especially for motorhomes. the view of the lake with its turquoise color is beautiful."
24142,2282455,3,Iree,22/08/2022,"I spent 3 nights here. Only on weekend there was noise from the nearby official campsite until 4am.
Otherwise a good place.
No shadow.


*** Please use a shovel for your dog's and your own toilet.
And leave no toilet paper pleeease.
Leave the place cleaner than you found it ***"
24142,2252432,4,clem_eva,17/08/2022,We enjoyed a beautiful sunset and sunrise overlooking the reservoir. In the evening we and a few other campers went swimming in the reservoir. Watch out for the wind at night (it got a bit shaky in our rooftop tent)
24142,2227990,4,Luuk9990,13/08/2022,"Beautiful location above the reservoir. You walk down a path to swim in the lovely water. Top spot, nice and quiet. Nice sunset. Small piece of the road broken, if you drive quietly it is doable."

24142,2063569,5,labordemickael,12/07/2022,"Great spot for 1 night, pleasant, calm and a very beautiful sunset."
24142,1815670,5,park4nignt,11/04/2022,"The landscape to access the lake is awesome…. for a few tens of meters, there is a hanging path but with a Cc of 7.5 it passes. Desert location but great"
24142,1804826,5,SylvainBlanc,03/04/2022,"beautiful view, and quiet. a little difficult the descent then great."
24142,1743823,5,sykwal,30/01/2022,great spot with a great view; ideal for taking great photos ^^ (be careful though at the entrance to the car park which is heavily crevassed over 2/3 meters)
24142,1481043,5,francoetclochette,19/08/2021,"Superb spot, lake view! We spent the night there, no problem. Attention the guards come around 9:30 am to check if everything is in order, no bad alarm clock but be careful!"
24142,1466389,1,olaffito,16/08/2021,"According to the point indicated by GPS you do not get anywhere, there are no tables nor is it possible to bathe, it is one of my ..."
24142,1044343,5,Zaldox,12/09/2020,Quiet and accessible place. Views of the swamp.
24142,935418,4,vavavan,07/08/2020,"Great spot, top views. We didn’t get bothered overnight. Next to a dam so not the best place for a swim. Beware the other ‘in nature’ spots around the lake, most of them were closed access.."
24142,624379,5,malibert,13/08/2019,Great view and a very quiet night! The descriptions in French and Spanish are misleading: there are no services here. At the lake or in the area maybe - but not at this parking lot.
24142,550283,1,Meletlich,12/07/2019,"No shower, or anything else at this location except the sun. No."
24142,533316,4,LESDUFF,30/06/2019,"All alone last night with the heat wave as a guest, the location above the dam was very comfortable and very quiet for one night! Happy to have found it! Magnificent view ! I confirm no service on this site."
24142,533313,4,LESDUFF,30/06/2019,"All alone last night with the heat wave as a guest, the location above the dam was very comfortable and very quiet for one night! Happy to have found it! Magnificent view ! I confirm no service on this site."

24142,482629,3,Choupiie,12/05/2019,I stayed behind the barriers of height.I stayed 3 days there without problem it was quiet.By against toilets / showers closed! There is a fountain in the center of Lerate
24142,341994,2,alexetmignon,18/08/2018,Attention to the description of presentation. It does not represent the parking place. There is nothing. It's just a corner or to land. Choose other locations around the lake.
24142,184111,3,pefelo,24/08/2017,"Small parking with lake view, quiet, close to the road, yet isolated, no convenience."
24142,179719,4,mariemarion,19/08/2017,"Parking dalloz dam, easy access by van. Great view of the lake. Free parking, no service."
24154,2194426,4,Jokerlola,08/08/2022,"this place is in burganes de Valverde not in miles of the powdery one!! The truth is that it is great, there is a lot of space with grass and shade, as well as another area with sand, swings, a beach bar, and an area to spend the night, asking for permission... we went to the town bar and asked, and they put us in contact with a man . The water of the Tera river is very clean, but be careful with the mosquitoes!"
24154,1292522,3,chusgeek,03/07/2021,"It is valid for one day, there are many mosquitoes, if you go one day they do not charge you anything if it is more than one day, a weekend for example € 20, the commercial issue is not very clear, the man who wants you to pay is very heavy and you He makes you understand that he doesn't want you to be there, every so often he comes to tell you something that can't be done, for one night he has a pass but nothing more."
24154,841710,3,fransousa,29/06/2020,"I have spent the day on the river beach. Very nice, quiet place with a beach bar. I ran into a couple who spent the night. The townspeople have set up a private ""camping"" and say that to spend several nights you have to pay a ""fee"" at the town hall. Come on, they've been there for free for a long time and they don't want anyone to go"
24154,656423,2,Cipomon,24/08/2019,"The place is very good, but it is not easy to understand the legislation of the place: ""it is forbidden to let go and take a bath with dogs. Seprona is notified"". To spend the night + 1 day it is necessary to get permission from the town hall (according to locals). It is full of cigarette butts. From the bar I prefer to skip my perception. The water is clean and there are several accesses. For camping there is also enough place."
24154,630882,4,madeincangas,15/08/2019,Quiet place with picnic area with river beach. Beach bar with bathrooms and a small playground. Camping area and caravan and van parking. I am not sure if it is private or public. We have not spent the night.
24154,558099,5,fulla,17/07/2019,"Site of 10 the comment is right in everything, river beach, swings, txiringuito, and a lot of shade to aparkar the van.a true wonder.Very recommendable to spend a couple of days.If if kuidao with mosquitoes, there is to come prepare kon repellent and some catxarrillo of those to plug for the van. thank you milles for this area"
24154,65989,3,javierlarrosa,22/03/2016,In these moments we are eating in front of the river Tera in a very nice place especially in summer.
24213,3292058,4,josemor,13/09/2023,"ASA-Motorhome Service Area located very close to the town center and the fantastic leisure complex with swimming pools (including a wave pool). It is not good for staying overnight because it is very next to the road and the ground is quite steep but, 750m away, next to the leisure complex, there is a motorhome park where you can stay overnight."
24213,3288754,4,Wambitos,12/09/2023,Right next to the road and with gray and black water emptying and also filling with water. Gratuitous.
24213,3184551,4,NunoM.Vieira,20/08/2023,To be excellent it should be in the motorhome park next to Praia das Rocas.
24213,3001934,4,Kiwinasje,22/07/2023,Place to dump your grey water and toilet. And you can get fresh water. All for free. On the side of a small parking place.
24213,2695580,5,luisfil78,25/04/2023,excellent service totally free in the middle of the mountains!!!
24213,2635515,4,beccyanddan,02/04/2023,"Great free facility, but very sloping pitches so we moved onto the parking opposite the river beach,"
24213,2609375,4,WestyP,14/03/2023,Just passing so emptied grey and black waste and filled up with water.  Didn’t stay as was heading further south.  Pitches looked a little sloping but great stop to fill up and empty.
24213,2597964,5,gerd56,04/03/2023,Very quiet place near small river. Single bin. No other amenities
24213,2524819,4,Laercio,19/12/2022,"Everything working and easy accessible, the official park down the road is also nice in middle of nature, spots close to the road are more leveled than the ones close to the river, there is some clowns going off-road there with cars  and motorcycles very close to the vans typical lack of respect in interior of Portugal, didn’t spent the night because the road noise but still very beautiful!"
24213,1889443,5,carmisifer,14/05/2022,"Near the ASA there is a nice, large motorhome park next to the river / near the ASA there is a nice large motorhome park next to the river."
24213,1080392,4,Parola,03/10/2020,Functional area and in excellent condition. Ideal for those who are passing through or want to stay in the Motorhome Park later on.
24213,999265,4,ricardogotcha,24/08/2020,Quiet and with the Rocas beach very close. There is a motorhome park nearby. A km further on.
24213,880760,4,agilapalante,19/07/2020,Complete and free service area but not for overnight stays. Better to go to the nearby Parking next to the river
24213,770426,5,knusulonus,19/01/2020,"Good supply and final disposal, standard water connection 1/2 inch, we didn't stay overnight."
24213,567927,1,pjpfc86,21/07/2019,"Poor wing, cars parked above dump zone, poorly functioning, non-standard taps Standard hose, full of insects, taps impessive condition. pear chestnut never again."
24213,100782,5,silvertidus,27/08/2016,"Very functional, impeccable!"
24221,2911881,2,veroialbert,01/07/2023,"Disappointed. The views from the campsite are beautiful, it's a pity that the plots are small and many are already occupied by fixed caravans, which means that the charm and the possibility of choosing are lost. The reception treatment was correct but not very welcoming and friendly. The positive are the toilets and showers very clean and quite new. The pool was also closed. I don't think we'll be back."
24221,2892902,2,Christophedouet,25/06/2023,"Very disappointed The plots are tiny, no space to open the blind of the van... They look like parking spaces between the caravans which are there all year round, people look for spaces before understanding... 23€ one van one person and electricity is very expensive for the service. Pool out of service at the moment. The toilets are correct. one of the worst campsites I've been on..."
24221,2691404,4,vegan269,23/04/2023,"What I liked least about this campsite is the area that is right near the road, almost all occupied by fixed caravans, but I went in season and there was room since it is quite large. The bathrooms are immaculate."
24221,2526188,3,Aitorcamper,22/12/2022,"Camping near PANTICOSA, the bathrooms are new, the pitches are very sloping, everything is uneven, we caught it raining and most of it was a mud…"
24221,2318150,3,RedVan77,29/08/2022,"Like normal camping. It has shade but the plots are very uneven and sloping. Most are occupied by caravans that no longer move. We spent two nights in it to begin to know the area. The bathrooms are very clean and it is very quiet. You can hook up the light, but you will need an extension cord of at least 10 meters. In some plots there is a long distance to the electrical box."
24221,2276106,5,DiegoMLML,20/08/2022,"Exceptional first-class campsite, everything very clean and the facilities great. There are two supermarkets right next to the campsite. Highly recommended!! The Tena Valley is beautiful."
24221,2266410,2,Whitestone77,19/08/2022,"The showers, pitches, laundry room and attention to what camping is, perfect. Restaurant, very bad. Request a table for 2 and in bad manners, a no, being exactly 21:34. The reason? They've been working since 9am and you can't. We look for a way to eat ""something"" around the town and on the way back, an hour and a half later, oh surprise!, the restaurant is still working with other diners."
24221,2216157,1,Amadver,11/08/2022,"Bad experience. DISAPPOINTED management. You look for your plot with a single requirement: that it is not occupied (that there is a table, chair or some ""occupied plot"" sign). 7 hours later, with an awning-van... assembled, they call us to ask us to change, that it was busy (it wasn't, there was nothing). Obviously we left the campsite, I can think of a thousand ways to do things better."
24221,2025192,3,LuciaCaravan,30/06/2022,"We spent one night. €28 AC and 2 adults. No services for AC. It has a swimming pool that is open from 07/01. The bathroom area and showers very well, new and clean. The campsite itself is very sad. With hardly any people. Only anchored and closed caravans. I would not go back."
24221,1482480,1,Juliaapa,19/08/2021,"Don't bother asking if you can empty deposits, they won't even let you pay the one-day fee. Little commercial vision, considering that there are much more beautiful and free places to spend the night."
24221,1396389,1,sukobuelta,02/08/2021,"I don't know the campsite, which is fine anyway, but just to see that they won't let you enter to empty and fill or pay… it tells me go to Sabiñanigo. Not calm, I'm going to Sallent, which is about 5km and I do it for free. Being able to get 10 € easy and fast ... really, lack of vision. I know where not to go."
24221,1369849,4,frederic.lecocq,27/07/2021,"I put 4 stars for the very friendly reception, on the other hand the places are very cramped and very close to the neighbor, just for a 7.50m motorhome. the services are very good mini-market shower etc .. on the other hand the swimming pool and too cold for very young children there are almost no people in the water too bad"
24221,1328361,5,JosemiCar,16/07/2021,"Cool. Good luck and we took the last square. Pool open until 20:00. The receptionist, Encarna charming. He gave us a lot of info. No noise at night. There is a churrería on the street near the entrance. € 28 CV and three adults."
24221,1179851,4,Serbumm,26/04/2021,Quite inexpensive. € 22 Furgo + 2 People + Dog. Adequate facilities and good views. Close to town and perfect for a walk around town. Recommendable!
24221,1097613,1,hector85,18/10/2020,Horrible treatment. The receptionists are very rude and unfriendly. We will never return in life.
24221,977042,5,anonimous,18/08/2020,"Medium tent, car and two adults € 23.76 per day. Bathroom facilities, showers, sinks .... new and clean. A great store, they have everything. Perfect pool to rest and refresh, barbecue area ..."
24221,960830,1,Quimvo,14/08/2020,"We stayed two nights. In both we could not sleep since there was a party (during the week, they were not the town festivals or anything) right next to the campsite until 5 in the morning. Therefore, at 8 in the morning they start cutting the grass making a lot of noise. The pitches are small but the bathrooms are new and clean."
24221,951023,1,ekavan,11/08/2020,"It does not offer motorhome services, if you are not staying at the campsite"
24221,862281,1,Goriz,12/07/2020,"We found the staff to be friendly but we will not be back. Tiny pitches, very noisy and unclean toilets"
24221,642097,3,jorgeaz84,19/08/2019,"Simple camping, very crowded and with small plots but with sufficient services. For € 22 (2 people + camper) not bad."
24221,575934,1,triston,25/07/2019,"Terrible treatment small spaces to maneuver, camping designed for caravans all year with its advances"
24221,527445,3,LaPeque,24/06/2019,"Camping with enough services to be comfortable. The plots are very narrow, you are stuck to the one on the side. Perfect to start lots of routes."
24221,196240,1,pilartruco,21/09/2017,"Snake empty of people but full of fixed caravans with their advances, temples, etc with 1m of separation between them and almost space for more.We charged € 22 / night 2personas camper. Dogs admitted, € 1.5 / night. Water emptied for free. Would not repeat"
24221,171774,3,Marsopio,11/08/2017,Camping complete with all services but very crowded. Small plots
24244,424476,1,davidjr1949,25/01/2019,"These are residential streets!
Overnight stays are NOT permitted."
24244,186605,2,marianomoral,28/08/2017,"Quiet place, quite traffic during the day, and moderate at night. A little away from the beach. Usually good."
24252,2073483,4,Titopomi,14/07/2022,beautiful town. In summer they add other car parks at the exit of the town
24271,3251565,5,BenRamDavid,02/09/2023,"Very clean and tidy, the hostess is very nice and explains everything if there are any questions, we came here because we were caught in the rain, the hostess brought us an umbrella with which we walked around the city, clean toilets, a clean and hot shower, those who have babies have a baby bath and a tidy and clean changing area"
24271,3238576,5,sylviealain7278,30/08/2023,"Top campsite, the owner gives us lots of information for visiting the north of Portugal, speaks French and is very friendly. Located approx. 500 m from the sanctuary. The sanitary facilities are very clean. We highly recommend. €24 campervan, 2 adults with electricity"
24271,3132169,4,averroes,12/08/2023,"I would say that it is an area with good services rather than a campsite, since the caravans are very close to each other. The toilets are very clean and comfortable and in general everything is very careful. You have to pay in cash because the device for the cards ""does not work"" ??? A good place for a couple of days."
24271,3115557,5,Hymi8,10/08/2023,We stayed 1 night... very warm welcome and very clean. The view is fantastic and the way to the church with over 700 steps down to the city can be reached in 5 minutes. Price-performance top.. highly recommended for long campers.
24271,3089181,5,smile1461,06/08/2023,Fabulous !!! Camping in a fantastic setting 5 minutes from the sanctuary. Staff at the top and very friendly. I highly recommend
24271,3066324,4,le-vallerot,03/08/2023,"Atypical campsite, on the terrace, on the heights of lamego. The sanitary facilities are clean, the pitches narrow but with a superb view, especially after dark. 5 minutes walk from the sanctuary (624 steps) Of course access to the campsite is via steep roads but without problem with a 7m50 motorhome. price around 32€ for C-car, electricity and 4 adults."
24271,3065147,5,vianabana,02/08/2023,"Excellent view over Lamego, extremely friendly staff."
24271,3062897,5,BSCM,02/08/2023,Great quiet place. Very well kept campsite. Idyllic setting. 5 minutes from the sanctuary. Impeccable welcome I recommend
24271,3062208,5,Familia27,02/08/2023,"very clean campsite, very pleasant, very nice and helpful owners. I highly recommend !"
24271,3033343,5,laponche,28/07/2023,"Very pleasant unusual campsite, small precision we have a 7m50 motorhome and had no difficulty accessing the campsite!"
24271,3030997,5,NunoSaPereira,27/07/2023,"Charming campsite. Super friendly owners. Very very good, calm and with an incredible view over the city."
24271,2948315,5,JanundAnja,11/07/2023,"We liked it very much, a lovingly furnished place, well suited for campers but also tents, with the best and cleanest sanitary facilities. Nice reception with information and bread service in the morning. The location was great for the 621 steps from the must see chapel down into town and back in the dark with impressive lighting. Rating WITHOUT a bottle of wine!"
24271,2941673,5,Marcel4485,09/07/2023,Very warm welcome. The ideal is to stay several days to benefit from the advice of the owners. Price €30 with 2 adults and 2 children and electricity for 1 night. We recommend ++
24271,2922346,5,Arakaya,04/07/2023,"A wonderful family campsite close to the center. Owners very helpful with wine tour organization and winery reservation. On site restaurant, garden, fresh bread in the morning. A magical place with a view, clean sanitary facilities, you can reach the center in 10 minutes through the back gate. Thank you and we wish you a nice summer."
24271,2880556,3,Ask0uille,22/06/2023,"I agree with the beausergio of sept 2022 We came to this camping area with the aim of tasting wine and port but our presence at the bar was not noticed, a Dutch couple was attracting the attention of 2 people in charge of the bar Note the extreme kindness of the employee... otherwise, a commercial welcome..."
24271,2757437,4,Bidulo,17/05/2023,"Charming area. The campervan space surrounds a beautiful, very well maintained house, on a paved courtyard at the front and dirt at the back. Excellent welcome (Clara speaks French), impeccable sanitary facilities, bar, services (delivery of bread, pizzas, etc.), wifi. Quiet on the height of Lamego. Arrive early for good seats. 2 pax + van: €20 (without electricity). Recommended without reservation."
24271,2734638,5,AnnFitzpatrick,08/05/2023,"Great location, 15 mins down the hill to the city. Spotlessly clean facilities and lovely seating area with bar. €20 for 2 people in van no electricity.  Highly recommend.  Yes it is a bit tightly packed but there is room for your table and chairs. The owners are very friendly and helpful. We'll be back!"
24271,2717411,4,SueWinter,02/05/2023,"Love this place. It has a great atmosphere, it's in the grounds of an elegant house with a very warm welcome. Motorhomes are a bit packed in but it doesn't really matter, as there is still space to use your own chairs and table, or you can sit in the large bar area. Food is available to order from a local restaurant, and rolls and croissants for the morning. 10 minutes' walk to the city."
24271,2694693,3,myglobalsoul,24/04/2023,"Pros: good location on a quinta overlooking the city. Everything very clean. Contra: you stand close together in a parking lot, where as many campers as possible are squeezed in. The owners always seem to make sure you do everything right. Everything seems overly commercial. We found 24 euros for van, 2 people Electricity also quite expensive for what was offered."
24271,2686484,5,marieLinebrard,21/04/2023,"Super campsite... Top-notch reception in French... Very clean sanitary facilities... A motorhome, 2 people €20 without electricity, nothing to complain about. We recommend without hesitation."
24271,2634450,5,kiwidreamer,01/04/2023,Exceptionally friendly reception. We were given good recommendations for excursions and hikes. The site and the sanitary facilities are extremely well maintained. The journey was completely unproblematic; the ascent is not that steep. Locally produced wine and port wine can be tasted.
24271,2570581,5,heinzanke,06/02/2023,A beautiful campsite with the best facilities in a good location. We would particularly like to take this opportunity to thank the operators for the extraordinarily good recommendations.
24271,2459232,3,Mojolibra,23/10/2022,it had been raining heavily and I couldn't make it up the slope to the campsite with my motorhome (6 m). So watch out when it's wet.
24271,2447068,5,Edtastic,16/10/2022,"Great place to park up to explore Lamego. Very friendly welcome and managed to get a good spot with views over the town. Other spots a bit ‘car park’ ish. 5 min walk to historic steps and short walk to town. Lovely little bar area.  Owner has a taxi service, great for our wine tour visit. Would stay again."
24271,2431875,5,MacPisi,08/10/2022,"We have felt very comfortable here. A small cute campsite with well-kept clean sanitary facilities. Communication in English was very nice and open. From the place great view over the valley. The places are relatively tight. That didn't bother us! We found the small bar in the outdoor area nice, where there are wines from the region. We'd love to come back. Martin & Margit from Lübeck"

I do not recommend the pizza because it had too thick a dough nor the salad very simple. All this for 22 euros. Otherwise the laundry service is 4 euros. I find it quite expensive but I can not compare."

Possibility of eating on site because they are delivered hot dishes from a restaurant next door (it's delicious). Sale of local products (wine and Porto) produced nearby and very good.

It shows that they have tried to get some, if you are going to lie down alone to sunbathe, it is fine. I went for a walk and it's torture. €50"
24275,2752812,5,Piaeh,15/05/2023,"A really great campsite! However, you also pay a lot for it"
24275,2729374,5,sitri,06/05/2023,"perfect to go with children. Parks, swimming pools, slides, table tennis, minigolf, tennis, etc...etc... Very good entertainment"
24275,2726584,5,calibeach,06/05/2023,"Nothing is missing, huge and well-kept plots, direct access to the beach, pools with slides, children's pools, etc. (September 2021)"
24275,2695302,1,MyJo,25/04/2023,"On April 24, 2023 we arrived at this campsite. They told the reception that they accept the ACSI card (23 euros). During registration there were suddenly no more ""ACSI places"" available and we had to pay 37 euros per night. On closer inspection, the campsite turned out to be largely empty."
24275,2658610,4,Larrainenea,10/04/2023,"Good camping, with all kinds of services. Perfect to go with the family, since pets are not allowed and there is entertainment at all hours. The only thing that many plots are sloping which leads to putting chocks. Mine were not enough for the terrain. They did not let us choose a plot. They have sent us to whoever they wanted and that the campsite was half empty."
24275,2626154,5,Katka74,27/03/2023,"It's our third time here..., we love this campsite. Although this time we experienced a little chaos because we arrived on the first day of opening, and not everything worked 100%, but that's probably part of it."
24275,2424259,5,lola2022,05/10/2022,We stopped by spontaneously. The place is very big. Pool etc. At the reception we got an overview of the free places. Then we were able to look around the site and choose for ourselves. We found a place at the end close to the sea - direct access. Deluxe pitches are generous with electricity and water V/E. Good supermarket with meat counter. Sanitary facilities nice. 43€/night.
24275,2407905,1,DetlevBohmann,27/09/2022,"Certainly a great place, but unfortunately forbidden for dogs."
24275,2375338,1,Olimax,15/09/2022,"my opinion only concerns users of the ACSI card. This campsite in no way respects the rules. The few miserable pitches offered are at the bottom of the campsite, by the roadside and very far from everything. In addition, they ask you for 25 euros while the Max rate for 2022 is 22 euros. Avoid absolutely if you want to pay the ACSI rate."
24275,2237920,5,Milataci,14/08/2022,"Amazing place for a family vacation. We liked everything - the program, the pools, the beach, the sea..."
24275,2072128,5,Timbolinooo,14/07/2022,"Great place. Ideal for families with children. The supermarket is also well stocked and reasonably priced. The place and toilets are good and maintained 24/7. However, the beach is very narrow, but you can always find a spot. So far we have hardly seen a facility that is more beautiful. We have a pitch in the first row by the sea. Unfortunately, this is also very steep towards the front. Our wedges are barely enough to compensate for this. Motorhomes longer than 7 m can have problems here. The price is very expensive but in our opinion it is worth it."
24275,2050560,5,TytusOne,08/07/2022,"Very expensive but worth every euro. Its a huge resort with camper, tent pitches and bungalows. Lot of staff, activities, shop, restaurants and bars. Night shows. Great pool area with grass flooring. Nice and big splash pool. You can move Your car out and spend next day for free until 5 PM."
24275,1846596,5,Manni0815,22/04/2022,"Were there a total of 5 nights and had a parking space directly on the beach/sea (approx. 75 €/night). Very nice campsite. Clean, new sanitary facilities. Wide range of leisure and animation activities. Bus to Cambrills stops right at the square; Express bus ""e7"" runs from Cambrills directly to Tarragona. Unfortunately, the spa was only open on weekends (€20/2 hours). Overall very satisfied."
24275,1843503,5,olansa,21/04/2022,"All perfect. Large and beautiful pitches, impeccable toilets, lots of shade, on the beachfront, supermarket, restaurants, shop, fishmonger, takeaways, entertainment, sports, cinema, shows, swimming pools... Our seventh year here."
24275,1649080,4,chrimilitole,17/10/2021,Very nice pitches near the sea. Correspondingly expensive - but probably standard for a place with this equipment. The sanitary facilities were large and very clean.
24275,1611682,1,Herbie1946,27/09/2021,A very large place with small and crooked plots. Prices astronomical. ACSI places are very far away from the sea and are not offered at all. With ACSI-CARD you get a 3 euro discount. We paid 83.98 euros for 2 people for 2 nights for a crooked place. That was the first and last time. This place is not recommended. Pure rip-off!
24275,1568618,3,siscuriba,11/09/2021,Good camping with good services but they should not be ACSI. They do not meet the requirements to meet this demand.
24275,1348309,4,Remolin,21/07/2021,"Very complete resort campsite, huge supermarket, very good swimming pools and direct access to the sea"
24275,1255652,5,fsanr25,14/06/2021,The best in campsites
24275,1198075,4,sabinette74,14/05/2021,"Beautiful campsite with very pleasant seafront pitches. The spa is closed today without explanation. The downside of this establishment is the catering, especially the restaurant ""la Terrasse"" (the only one open at the end of May). Not very good, industrial desserts thawed, no cocktails, only one unprofessional waitress, hateful room acoustics. 5 deserved stars ??"
24275,1194479,1,Rasjahcor,13/05/2021,The campsite does not look bad but as we got there we had to leave ... they do not accept pets
24275,1058731,2,ImmaGene,19/09/2020,"The camping in general correct, the 5 stars of which they boast are not appreciated much. If you go with Acsi they have a more secluded area from everything but they tell you that it is closed or that there are no places left and they send you to plots that cost twice as much. From the comments I have read, it is seen that it is a common practice. They should not appear in Acsi."
24275,1025251,1,tornasol,04/09/2020,Reception bitter and expensive woman. They don't want our furry ones.
24275,676921,5,TheFords,05/09/2019,"Great site, good places, beach front spots are the best. Toilets/showers immaculate. Friends restaurant on the beach is a must.  Only downside with site the ££££."

24275,502214,4,CBWS,03/06/2019,"Great camping resort with all amenities. Places in various price categories, trees. No dogs. Direct access to the sea (sand and round stones, shallow access). 2 pool landscapes, diving, spa, daily animation, grocery stores, car cleaning places incl. Vacuum cleaner. International audience, on WE even in the off season well crowded. Sanitary facilities could be cleaner."
24275,480948,4,piaf59,10/05/2019,"Large campsite, nice facilities, games for children, swimming pool ... good home 27 euros 2 people, a motorhome car electricity drain and water ... location for caravans and not for camper. a flat, the train that passes and honks3 night and day. do not come on weekends because very noisy ...... small beach at the end of the camp ... supermarket bakery restaurant in the camp."
24275,453244,1,mao14,12/04/2019,"No room for standard pitches 20 € with the ACSI card but offers ""prime"" pitches from 30 €. Again this campsite does not play the game with the ACSI card. Our request was of course out of season and off big weekend"

Great for shopping, you can do your dirty laundry of at least 1 week in 1 go (of course for a fee), refuel your camper at significantly lower fuel prices and if necessary, you can also wash your camper."

24289,2695214,1,eurotrotterV8,25/04/2023,"perfectly accessible with a large camper, but these are 3 normal parking spaces for cars. we drove to the campsite."
24289,2653557,5,jonatanpardo,09/04/2023,"Don't get complicated. Don't go through the center as there is a 3m tunnel to cross the tracks. It is easier to go east, cross the tracks over a bridge, go down Segorbe street or leave the car on Sierra Espadan street and walk up to start the Salto de la novia route. There is online parking."
24289,2589822,5,DeMira,24/02/2023,"I don't understand the comments, we are here right now, we have arrived with a Camper with no problem, we have not passed any tunnel, we come from Segorbe. That if the parking lot is very small we are alone and right at the door of the interpretation center of the bride's jump, we will stay to sleep."
24289,2548329,1,WilmaAufTour,10/01/2023,Please note that driving over the entire city area is prohibited for > 3.5 t. This means that the parking lot for heavy motorhomes cannot be reached! See attached photo.
24289,2504458,2,Cruizer76,24/11/2022,Out of season everything is free and there is enough space. We are 3.05 m high with the mobile home and easily drove through the 3.10 m tunnel.
24289,1914656,4,peoplecalled,25/05/2022,We stood here with our relatively large mobile home. Bypassing the bridge takes 2 minutes more instead of 25 minutes. The parking lot is very small but we had no problems.
24289,1839658,1,CorsarioCM,20/04/2022,"Tiny car park that in high season is impossible to park, you have to go around the surrounding neighborhood and strangely confuse being painted in a faded blue area with white and without parking meters in the area so you don't know if you have to pay or not (I already advance k no) you pay €2 to enter, you can enter for free from the greenway but the €2 gives you access to the Interpretation Center, it is worth it"
24289,1838540,1,wandamante,19/04/2022,"To get to the car park you have to go through a small 3.1m high tunnel, so motorhomes cannot get there. The alternative route to avoid it is 25 minutes."
24289,1196827,1,balavag,14/05/2021,"They charge € 2 to enter to see the waterfall that, unless there are recent rains, is a pool of retained water. There is no place to park. Do not be fooled."
24289,1169268,3,Capora,06/04/2021,Parking is limited but there is room in the nearby streets. We have parked right in front of the Salto de la Novia interpretation center. I imagine that in high season it will be more difficult but it is normal if you go with a motorhome. The setting is very beautiful and the waterfalls had abundant water. And Navajas has seemed to us a very nice and cozy town.
24289,95111,1,manbenew,15/08/2016,The parking area is now located more than 1 km from the bathing area. You can no longer park on the road that goes down to the bathroom area. There is no type of service except the paper mills. The waterfall is the end of an irrigation ditch. Depending on the irrigation of the orchards there is more or less. The last time I went there was little water and the pool was very dirty.
24315,2994351,3,cassrens,20/07/2023,"Beautiful campsite with spacious pitches. Nice reception, nice sanitary facilities, but water was not hot! small supermarket, but the Playa is not that much (nothing). We paid 43.50 euros for 2 people and a dog plus electricity. We think this is really too expensive. That's why quickly again!!"
24315,2927174,2,Imanolescaracoles,05/07/2023,"The only good thing is clean toilets/showers but with cold water and the great welcome treatment. A reservoir full of fleas makes your legs thin, an expensive supermarket and they don't let you pay by card for less than €10. NO WIFI, NO COVERAGE Large pitches but little shade, dogs loose around the campsite... AND EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT IT IS 1 night €36.10 van, two adults and a dog. We are sorry but we do not recommend it."
24315,2868662,4,tomliloutobby,18/06/2023,We spent only one night there with our motorhome. Very nice campsite. Very friendly welcome. Very not value for money. We recommend this campsite for a stopover.
24315,2821467,4,ChristianSGL69,05/06/2023,"We spent 3 nights (May 21-24) at this campsite with our CC. Pitch delimited by rope on the ground sufficiently large. Absolute comfort. The WiFi around the reception-bar-restaurant-mini-supermarket area works very well. Sheltered area with tables equipped with BBQ. Super clean toilets. In the middle of orchards during the cherry season, it's brilliant and super good. Awesome pool."
24315,2779342,4,AdriaOsel,23/05/2023,"Very nice tree-shaded stands, comfortable sanitary facilities and hot water for showering and washing dishes, shop and restaurant with a nice atmosphere. Unfortunately no mobile phone reception at all, but stable WLAN at the restaurant, which makes it difficult if you have to be reachable. Although the operator is not responsible for this, only 4 stars from us."

24315,2152253,5,Mullaghroe,31/07/2022,A unique place. Almost an oasis in a desert. Straight out of a spaghetti Western. Shaded pitches with a laid back vibe. Met some lovely Dutch fellow travellers and tried a bit of SUP on a very placid lake/reservoir. Nice bar and restaurant. Caspe has some interesting history too.
24315,2128914,5,Relook-cars,26/07/2022,"Came to spend a night there because of passage in the region, I am surprised but really, I did not know the region, exit of the highway, nothing around and this campsite. At the top nothing to say. Everything is here . Top-notch toilets. Swimming pool and beach, thank you"

Large swimming pool, swimming possible in the lake, boat rental, paddle, pedal boats, excellent fishing spot. Campsite with bar, restaurant (€13 per person all inclusive), small supermarket, very clean sanitary facilities. We stayed there for 4 days. Very friendly welcome."
24315,2080925,2,SPIZA,16/07/2022,"The campsite is not bad. It is in the middle of the desert yes. The store is very expensive, better to arrive well supplied. No animation the days we were, large plots but a lot of stone. The hot pool water is not used to cool you down. The lake is very close but you won't find any shade... bring an umbrella."
24315,2005005,5,Sivanjemente,23/06/2022,"We only spent one night in low season (9:50 p.m. two people with a camper, without electricity), many things were not yet open but we found it very cozy and with well-cared facilities. We recommend it."
24315,1989933,5,Martin1950,18/06/2022,"A very pleasant campsite. Friendly management, a lovely swimming pool with sunbeds and a field next to it with trees. Spacious pitches.

24315,1473221,5,FaSz,17/08/2021,"Very quiet campsite to spend a couple of nights. It has direct access to the Sea of Aragon, with a jetty and a river beach. The GR99 passes through the door of the campsite, perfect for a 15-20km route combined with bathing in the river. Lovely scenery."
24315,1440152,3,Majelop,11/08/2021,"We stopped by chance because we brought children and the heat was tightening. the pool good and also well priced. The AC, 2A and 2N € 29. good loading and unloading"
24315,1423814,3,AnneGuillien,08/08/2021,"The lake is just beautiful, we spent two unforgettable days kayaking with no one around us (probably linked to the covid). On the other hand, the campsite is extremely noisy, relative calm from one in the morning and the families wake up at around 8 am .... short nights ...."
24315,1361813,3,Remolin,25/07/2021,"Camping where we did a night on the way. Ideal for amateurs who like fishing, canoes, ... as it has direct access to the reservoir."

I don't understand how in July a campsite can be closed, I suppose the covid has something to do with it. The guy who was doing maintenance tried to open us up but the owner or manager did not give him permission ..."
24315,736925,3,sylvie6064,03/11/2019,"Good location on the edge of the lake and good reception at the reception. Good sanitary facilities. By cons, the restaurant of this campsite is to be avoided. The room is not at all welcoming, the staff is rude and the food served is very very average. It's a shame for a campsite ***."
24315,661598,3,HolgHogan,26/08/2019,"In itself a very nice campsite. The pitches are big enough. The sanitary facilities top. The water in the lake is clear and clean. If the wind is unfavorable, unfortunately a fäkalgeruch blows over the place. At night, unfortunately, very loud, because the campground disco until 02:30 clock loudly over the entire place sounds. Therefore not recommended for parents with baby."
24315,634095,2,isamaxi,16/08/2019,"The pool area is very good, the price is good but the camping area is very much left and there is no vigilance of how the areas are used. In one area they get to enter the caravan arbor kitchen car until the cars are outside the area from the hallway A campsite to spend a passing night. The owners and very friendly staff"
24315,633322,4,Nanatawa,16/08/2019,"Nice campsite, quiet, shaded. There is bar, restaurant, swimming pool, small grocery store. Access on the lake. Price very correct. We paid 9.10 € for the camping car 6.5 € per adult per night. So 22.1 € for a night in the middle of August. The sanitary very clean, warm showers that's good. The restaurant is ok but it is a buffet, there is not much choice for 13 euros."

The restaurant is very correct."

24315,84063,4,benoit85,22/07/2016,"Small campsite very friendly and quiet, the welcome is excellent. We made the detour between Zaragoza and Barcelona for the night and were not disappointed. The toilets are very clean. Price 1 night for a motorhome + 2 people + electricity 25 €. Some would say that it is too expensive but the tranquility and comfort in this season at a price."

I don't give 5 stars because I think they could renew the common areas a bit (bathrooms, pool...). A positive point is the bathroom with a bathtub exclusively for babies. The staff very nice. The situation is also very good, close to the beach, a supermarket and restaurants."

Washing machine and dryer worked well."
24332,2982084,2,familienmichael,18/07/2023,"The pool is great although the sun beds are falling apart. Beach nearby is great, you can lease sun beds. We were a bit disappointed since we chose this one for having a kids club and activities. Nobody speaks one word of English in the kids club so only Spanish speaking kids will understand. The so-called fitness room was 20sqm and had no dumbbells only a few bikes and treadmills."
24332,2914854,3,KatrinX.,02/07/2023,"Nice pitches quite close to the beach. Pool usable, small market around the corner. We found the sanitary facilities pretty dirty. The toilets were often very ""dirty"". Not nice! In addition, the price was not justified. We paid €102 for 2 nights in a van for a 70sqm pitch. For comparison: We paid €52 for the same service on another pitch."
24332,2886789,4,MJPp4n,24/06/2023,"Great location, super site facilities, however if you are doing other than camping, the pitches will be very expensive. We paid 28E for a very small pitch with no water or electrics, van pitch for 2 people circa 53E without electricity."

24332,2577534,1,helenis,14/02/2023,"The campsite is full. I give it one star because the reception is unpleasant, few help facilities, much better the option of the area that is next to the Ferrer campsite where there is the possibility of paying for the services even if you do not spend the night. The area is 9.5 with emptying and filling and a hot water shower. This was full and the deal was terrible but it made us know other much better places"

You park correctly and with people on both sides, without any privacy. Old and dirty facilities, especially the chemical toilet. The gray water is outside the campsite and the drinking water tastes like dirty rubber. And worst of all, the price."

Quiet environment and next to the beach. In July two people with a van €50 per day. It's expensive, but for its location and in summer it's not bad. Bathrooms fine. The gym is only for cardio, it doesn't even have a bench press."

Correct facilities, swimming pool, toilets... the plots have electricity and water taps. Reception staff very nice and attentive. It does not have a supermarket but there is one at the end of the street that is very good"
24332,2013410,4,Llorente,26/06/2022,Quite large junior pitches. Washbasins and showers well equipped but on Sunday morning they were not clean. Privileged location due to its proximity to the beach.
24332,1984121,4,SebiMercy,17/06/2022,"Ideal to visit Peniscola. washbasin in place. Spacious cells. A bit expensive, 2 people with electricity €36.40."

24332,1963277,3,autokarramarra,10/06/2022,Very basic campsite. Simple and uncomplicated. It's fine to spend a couple of nights in Peñíscola but I wouldn't do a long-term vacation.
24332,1912320,3,peoplecalled,24/05/2022,"Very very small places. For the price no additional services included such as WLAN. Right next to skyscrapers and a sports field. If you like mass tourism, this is the place for you. We paid €34 for one night with a 6 meter vehicle."

24332,1852686,3,val65,25/04/2022,"Advantages: very well placed: 2 mins from the beach and 15 mins from the centre! Very warm welcome: speaks French, English… German, nice swimming pool. 30€ for 1 night in a van for 2 people, electricity, large pitch, hot shower - the disadvantages: prowling cats looking for food, lack of greenery and privacy! For 1 or 2 nights it's perfect but it all depends on what you are looking for"
24332,1845376,4,eugenia,22/04/2022,Highly recommended campsite in front of the sea and near the castle. Ideal to go with family and pets. Right in front there is a dog park with a small agility circuit.
24332,1807995,4,MartinAns,06/04/2022,"Very nice campsite right in the center on the beautiful Long Beach. The place has a pool and a great restaurant! The plots were very well laid out and there was enough space to the neighbors! The sanitary facilities were also very clean. It was a bit noisy, but that's because the place is in the city."
24332,1802487,3,Kwakaman,31/03/2022,A good friendly and helpful welcome and great location for the beach and about 30 minutes walk into the old town of Peniscola. Campsite had a slightly dated and tired feel and the pitches were of a gravel similar to cat litter which probably accounts for the amount of stray cats wandering around and doing their business wherever they liked. Felt safe and secure and was nice and quiet.
24332,1792921,4,f6iqa,23/03/2022,"Very well. Pleasant staff. Location 1km from the city. 10 mins by the seaside promenade. Vehicle required for major shopping (lidl in Benicarlo). Sink on each pitch. Flat for the hordes of cats who are not afraid of anything and who rob everything that eats at the slightest inattention, even in our presence. You have to put everything away and it's very restrictive."
24332,1789271,5,JoseAguirre,20/03/2022,"We have been a whole weekend, although bad weather has accompanied us, it is a very complete and beautiful campsite next to the beach and ten minutes from the castle of Peñíscola, it does not lack detail, on the same plot you have a sink, electricity, satellite television and cable internet, we will repeat"
24332,1780700,4,Helton,12/03/2022,"Good location, 20min walk to the old town. Small supermarket close by. Acsi pitches can be tight for larger vans, but we paid €17 per night for 8 nights. Very clean sanitary facilities. 

Only downside is the proximity to the football ground, if you're on the south side be prepared for daily noise from players, supporters, referees."
24332,1779299,4,momottejf,10/03/2022,"Very friendly welcome speaking very good French... Place a bit tight for a 7m... As for the sanitary facilities, 2 blocks almost next to each other and therefore very far from most pitches... With the ACSI card we paid 17€ per day for 1 week.."
24332,1772461,4,PhoenixCologne,03/03/2022,"Well-equipped campsite with a complete infrastructure, which is also inexpensive with the ACSI card. Plots very small and unsuitable for large mobile homes. Peninsula Peniscola easily accessible on foot."
24332,1771571,5,marano29,02/03/2022,Campsite very well placed because very close to the city center and the beaches. Wide but short pitches with branches. Our 7m got in without too much difficulty but that's the maximum. Then it's very good and very sunny because the trees have no leaves. There are a few large squares that are all occupied because many French people spend the winter there. Hot water for washing dishes
24332,1761666,3,Hakky,21/02/2022,"Acceptable well-attended place even in late winter. Friendly front desk, everything always clean, well managed. Free WiFi since February 2022 with your own router against a deposit. BUT: If you are unlucky like us, you will be assigned a mini plot that is definitely not suitable for mobile homes. These are overgrown with pine trees, which makes maneuvering almost impossible. Therefore at least 1 star deduction."
24332,1759448,5,stephanmichaela,18/02/2022,The entire place and sanitary facilities were very clean even though the place was full. Good location to the beach 200m and to the old town 1000m

24332,1655070,5,JessyBKing,21/10/2021,"Very nice campsite with different parcel sizes but narrow passages. Staff, speaks Spanish, English and German. The campsite is divided into two parts by a road. The sanitary facilities and showers are clean"

24332,1636575,1,Nostramo,10/10/2021,"In high season too expensive for what they offer. Depending on the plot, the bathrooms can catch you very far. Overcrowding typical of a refugee camp. Not very nice staff."
24332,1618264,3,TageArvid,30/09/2021,"Unpleasant male employee at the front desk. The campsite was nice, good pool area. However, no camping fully adapted for families with children. Ideal for seniors who like to sit outside their motorhomes and watch people. Did not feel like we fit in with two small children. Not a lot of toilets, difficult to fill the motorhome with water and you do not have the right connection."
24332,1531677,4,Suricatobike,30/08/2021,"Great camping, very spacious pitches, large pool and very attentive staff, you also have the beach three minutes walk, highly recommended."
24332,1525294,5,23Patricia23,28/08/2021,"Spectacular campsite. The location is excellent and the pitches huge. They let you put the vehicle, at no additional cost, on the same plot. The bathrooms were always very clean. There are many activities for both children and adults. The beach is across the street and there is a great promenade to walk or bike. I will repeat without a doubt."
24332,1496309,4,maiteatu,22/08/2021,"A great campsite, you can almost spend the whole day without leaving there and without getting bored by all the services it offers. A large pool, clean bathrooms, shaded pitches ... The only bad thing is the price, in high season it gets a bit out of hand."
24332,1447894,4,Josecar,13/08/2021,"With all the services, swimming pool and next to the beach. It would be perfect if it weren't so expensive."
24332,1407469,3,Labaron,05/08/2021,We repeat camping but in high season and we are very disappointed. We had been in low season and we liked it so much that we repeated. In high season and with Covid things changes. The pool gets too crowded and no action is taken and yet the children have to dance sitting in the mini disco. Very little satisfied with the children's entertainment. The performances however very good.
24332,1346622,4,Monderland,21/07/2021,"I'd give it a fifth star if it was cheaper, but that's okay. In July a large volume van and two adults, on a 70m2 plot for € 58 per night with electricity and individual sink. The squares are shaded, the bathrooms are clean and the area on the other side of the pool is very quiet. There is animation from morning to night, and 2 hours of ludoteka for children. 2 'from the beach."

24332,1301197,5,vwtravellers,06/07/2021,"Extraordinary camping !!!! We paid € 32 for a camper and two people, we stayed 4 nights and super good. Clean bathrooms every time you go to the bathroom, very well maintained facilities, well maintained and clean swimming pool. Super friendly camping staff. We left at 12:00 pm but they let us stay in the pool and showers all day. For price and proximity to the beach it is great !! We will return !!"
24332,1296679,5,MarianneGOBBO,04/07/2021,"It is well worth 5 stars, we stayed there for 3 nights. Beach 50m away and not far from the old town of Peniscola. The showers and toilets are very clean, cleaned several times a day. I will stay there again without hesitation!"
24332,1287384,5,Kratosysara,30/06/2021,"We have spent two nights, a camper and two people with electricity 27 euros every day. It has a pool, but we haven't been. The beach is next door (about 200 meters), get to the Papa Luna castle, a walk of about 15 minutes walk along the promenade. We have been very comfortable."
24332,1285969,3,altasucie,29/06/2021,"Much noise at night you can not rest. The facilities are good and clean. The theme of having a very comfortable pool and beach. The prices seem excessive to me, they charged us € 68.50 for one night, 2 adults and 2 small children, it seems like a torrada, let's not even do the cleaning and the beds in the caravan."
24332,1271363,4,Kai270,22/06/2021,Location and facilities great. Price ok for the preseason.
24332,1268293,4,soga,21/06/2021,"A comfortable campsite due to its location and facilities. We have been comfortable. The only thing we did not like was the issue of cleanliness in the toilets (especially the one in the pool, since it is not cleaned enough times), and that there was no security. On the part of some campers, nighttime sleep was overrated, and no one said anything to them. And the issue of masks as if there were no pandemic."
24332,1229522,5,Nurre73,01/06/2021,Our best stay!! On Sunday arrival the very friendly young lady gave good information. Clean sanitary facilities and super showers. Right on the beach and nice walk to the center. Pitch for 7.5 m camper is narrow

24332,1153981,3,Missbick,19/03/2021,"Camping 15 minutes walk from the center. Something uncomfortable for motorhomes since the emptying is done outside the campsite. Very clean and tidy but small pitches. Sink on the plot, it is appreciated."
24332,1119860,2,pedrocogo,07/12/2020,"Like all or most campsites, they give little thought to motorhomes. Small pitches, they do not have even a sad slide for children. Emptying of gray water and filling incorrectly, it is located outside the campsite, to access it you have to do it with the key with which you enter the campsite, but you have to put your nose or put your ass in. There is no mobile coverage, they charge you € 5 / day for decent Wi-Fi."
24332,1119845,2,Lidiali,07/12/2020,"Small campsite, not bad at all, but for motorhomes the pitches are quite small, the ones that are a little bigger, you pay a little extra, there is no park for children to play and the water drainage is bad to empty, our car is very big and we did not fit, with acsi two nights car, 2 adults and a child with light 43e"

The pool was very good, the animation was run by a very nice boy who tries hard to take care of people and children. The lifeguard person is very correct and very attentive in everything, it is appreciated with children.The assessment is three stars for the price, I suppose that the bonuses of more days would pay off ,,,"

24332,700636,1,sofianie,22/09/2019,Does not meet expectations after booking 3 months in advance we only had one location instead of two which have been paid but not refunded. pure and simple flight. the manager is impossible to see he gives his instructions to the hostess hostesses without wanting to assume. Camping noisy especially the WE.

Quite ample plot with sink and electric current that goes into the price with two types of European camping plug and standard as the house. The pool area is nice and it was open but it was cold, although we could one day lay on the hammocks in the sun. The jacuzzi sticks is that the water is too cold. The showers with hot water. There was a mini club for children and night performances in the restaurant. Small supermarket next door. Walk from the beach to Peñíscola between 10-15 min walk. For the back part there are paths next to the marsh to walk or go by bike."

Its fort is its privileged location, since you can walk down (through the forest) to Fornells and Aiguablava and from there take a coastal path to go north (Pals) or south (Tamariu) through the many beautiful coves that motivate the trip to this area. You can also do the same by bike, by bus or with your car. A top camping, complete and with much more than you need. Ideal. We stayed for a week and will surely return."

It is next to the beach that they have set up next to the river and there is a bar where you can have lunch and dinner.

Attention, the driveway is quite steep on the way back, but proved quite alright with a 2.3 litres turbo diesel on a 3.5 tons van. There are other pissible spots, e.g. 2 km further upstream!"

24375,1697262,4,Lauravenard,24/11/2021,"Superb spot almost at the top of the Estrella range. The space is large and can accommodate a large number of vehicles, so you can park wherever you want depending on your vehicle. We have an L3 van so we stayed upstairs near the buildings, we didn't venture behind the dam (better to have a 4x4 to get there). Please note that the snack bar is closed in winter, so no catering or toiletries. Also, don't forget your snow tires and chains. In the early morning we discovered 3cm of snow outside! Magic ! On the other hand, zero network."

24449,1428629,5,roggerbravo,09/08/2021,"Excellent views and very quiet to spend the night (we came to spend the night and we have already been there for 2 days), they start charging for parking in the morning and it costs € 5 for AC and € 3 for cars. There is a beach bar very close, outdoor showers and toilet (restrooms). We recommend placing arenal de moris beach on the gps and taking the route that surrounds the town since the road indicated by the app is very irregular."
24449,1421747,5,bbragado,08/08/2021,"An idyllic and very quiet place to stop. Beach very close to 2min walk with all services. During the day the parking lot fills up but at the end of the day it remains empty, only the camper and AC remain."

Near the beach and the beach bar. Normally you cannot spend the night but the Civil Guard did not pass. Quite a few vans and AC that stayed overnight. The guy who charges warned us that he cannot stay overnight but that the Civil Guard have never fined."
24449,1336648,5,RaqBP,18/07/2021,"We arrived on Saturday, July 17, around 10 p.m. and there was no one to collect. We spent the night here in peace, there were many more cars and vans but plenty of room. Around 9 in the morning the civilian passed by warning that around 9.15am he would start charging, in case we wanted to go out and not pay, so perfect to spend the night without spending!"
24449,1336176,1,LaBambinaBracha,18/07/2021,"Closed!!! They have made a roundabout to go around, there is only one parking lot further back that is from the campsite itself, I imagine that because there were coaches you could park paying, it's imagination was not verified."

The car park is a bit sloping but everything is fixed with damage, even if we don't have to use them. On June 25th (Friday) we had no problem staying there. Camping-etilk 200 meters"

24449,1247647,4,Bandida,10/06/2021,Really nice spot ovelooking the beach. only 3 other vans and no troubles with the police. the field wasn't the most leveled and there were cows in a field nearby that were mooing all night long.
24449,1244657,5,Juhmi,09/06/2021,Beautiful and quit place. We stayed a night without any problems. Nice view and just two more vans. The shower are closed but the public toilets are open from the morning to evening.

24449,1057517,5,pierrotpiodu62,19/09/2020,"Spent a good night in peace under the lapping of the ocean and superb view. Free pitches on a slightly sloping ground. Unpacking prohibited, I think we were in the parking lot and not on the apron. But in September nobody will come to check, I think."
24449,1055118,3,Rasjahcor,17/09/2020,"We wanted to spend the night in the meadow just above it, which is where it is allowed and it is also flat but it was closed. Finally we have slept in the parking lot next to several vans and AC's without problems. If it is true that the terrain is quite steep and you have to level with chocks. As it was low season, no one came to collect."
24449,1051972,4,xavolas1,16/09/2020,"Parking with access to the beach and beautiful views. Only day, there are picnic tables. Out of season there is no one to pay. The public toilets were closed."

24449,723112,3,blindox,16/10/2019,"Nice, but on busy, it depends what we are looking for. For info a rainy Wednesday in mid October, about 15 vans and camper up and 5 or 6 at the parking downstairs. Beautiful waves."
24449,669113,5,bene50,30/08/2019,Great place! The owner was very friendly and left us the next day until 13 o'clock in the parking lot and not again cashed. World class view!
24449,648145,2,aprilvis69,21/08/2019,"Nice place ah beach. high chocks needed. It is not clear where you can and cannot stand. There is a paying (campers 5 eur) and a free part. On the latter we were kindly requested to move in the morning. We barely had time to clean up. We do not care to pay for parking, but because of the arrogant man we left for the next beach"

24449,603283,4,roadstofollow,06/08/2019,"Perfect place, can even put your table outside etc, but the man who owns the parking is a bit grumpy. We arrived at 15:00 so we payed 5 euro, the next morning at 09:05 he came back for another 5. We told him we would leave soon so we did not pay, but he started yelling and pointing at a sign saying we had to leave. Besides that, lovely place."
24449,588869,5,sergi_ac,31/07/2019,Quiet place with spectacular views. Too inclined in my opinion. From 19:00 free until 9:00 the next day.

24449,557073,5,BuF,16/07/2019,"Great view. The beach is about 10m lower and is reached with a few steps. Despite high season (16.7.) Only 5 guests. Slightly oblique but upper part, the wedges have been enough. The neighboring square is more level towards the coast. Both places are right next to each other."
24449,549628,5,josv,12/07/2019,The most beautiful place to stay on our trip to Spain. Dreamlike nature and colors in the mountains. It smells of sea and flowers. Clean and lovely with a small bar on the beach. I did not want to leave.

24449,473057,4,Marengo,01/05/2019,"Very nice spot but off season you can follow the road and park at the bar (closed off season) which is even better and right next to the beach. Quiet night with 2 other campers, toilets were closed when we arrived around 6 pm but a lady came next morning and opened them at 10 am. There is a beach shower next to the toilets. Perfect for one night."
24449,455069,5,leosimon,14/04/2019,Great parking without any restrictions with spectacular views has a little slope but great

24449,413732,5,Tioutby,12/12/2018,"Great location in this season, there is no one and you can even put yourself on the parking right next to the beach below. For surfers the waves are top and there is nobody in the water."

24449,305564,3,duduritz,29/07/2018,Parking 5 € for vans and caravans. To pay in cash. We arrived around 15h and there was still room. The parking dispatcher specified that it was forbidden to spend the night. We preferred to stay elsewhere although other recent comments said you could sleep there. Beautiful beach.
24449,301570,5,whzfuxxx,26/07/2018,"Great spot, sleeping at the cliff to the seaside. Wavy waky waky! Dont stay too long as parking at daytime costs 5€. Needed to pay at around 10!
Showers are free and working day and night.
Toilettes at the Surf school, open in the morning.


Police passed at night but didnt stop!"

24449,274041,5,DeeDeeVendy,24/06/2018,A beautiful and now in the middle of June still very quiet place. There are cows at the parking lot and you have a wonderful view of the beach. Toilets and showers are within 2min walking distance.
24449,271076,4,Speedstar75,19/06/2018,Stayed one day and night. Street lights lamps light up area at night. Toilets and showers open at this time. Shared night with one other van. Some flat spots lower down. Police came and looked but left. No issues.  Nice little cafe/bar which was open in beach car park 2 mins further down.

24449,193646,5,agarciascudo,14/09/2017,"We arrived on a Sunday in September and at night looking for a place to sleep. There were several van and AC and we stayed. A beautiful site and spectacular beach. Very quiet and with lampposts. In the morning, the dogs were able to run along the beach. Nobody charged us anything"
24449,182918,5,Descargados,23/08/2017,"Good place with grass, € 5 a day, legally you can not stay overnight but many people do it and nothing happens. Chiringuito 5 minutes away. Good beach"

24449,98232,5,prof81,21/08/2016,For me a perfect place. It does not have services but it stays quiet and accompanied. Very close to the beach and also close to one for dogs. Unbeatable views

24452,3279306,1,maribelgt,10/09/2023,"Very, very, very loud. hard to sleep here It is appreciated that they think with those in the motorhomes, but there is too much noise to sleep peacefully. It is a very central car park that is very good for visiting the city. But right next to the promenade that is busy at all hours, and with a bus stop that passes by at all hours and stays there with the engine running. You have to pay for the blue zone. It's more expensive than an area"
24452,2696381,4,RC1003,25/04/2023,Perfect to see the town. Quiet and central.
24452,2672883,1,julesdq,15/04/2023,"We slept well here, it is much quieter than you would imagine.  However the next day in the middle of the afternoon someone broke into our van without damaging the vehicle luckily.  Seems unbelievable as it is a very central spot.  There are no cameras on the carpark."
24452,2658385,5,PaskusVan,10/04/2023,"Thank you for offering this parking area, we were able to meet and have lunch in your City."

24452,2540925,3,anditz33,04/01/2023,"It's ok just for sleeping, but there is traffic during the night. Very central to visit Reus."
24452,2539675,4,eloiem,03/01/2023,Wide squares and quite central. Too bad it's paid. To spend the night I think it must be too noisy
24452,2528043,3,Segelhexe,25/12/2022,"Great for looking at the city. No ticket necessary on Sundays. Unfortunately, 2 of the 4 mobile homes were occupied by cars. Uncertain if overnight stay allowed. On Sunday and Christmas Day it was relatively quiet from 3 p.m."
24452,2525345,4,vbaas,20/12/2022,The parking lot is ideal for a van. Proximity for visits. Paying but it is also the almost certainty of having a place (the controllers prowl and make sure that the big places are not occupied by cars).
24452,2518635,4,xavierfarras,10/12/2022,"parking with 4 spaces reserved for motorhomes, asphalted and leveled. although sometimes there are cars. no services. it is paid as a blue zone. from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. 4 hours €4.50. very close to the center. ideal for visiting rivers."

24452,2485621,5,GRMRNS,06/11/2022,Thanks to the person who mentioned the four city centre spots for motorhomes in this car park. Overlooked and so car park feels secure. Excellent location. Perfect spot to visit beautiful Reus for the day. Not overnight friendly I do not think (and would be noisy for sleep).
24452,2418248,4,camidalella,02/10/2022,"4 parking spaces reserved for AC although depending on the day you may find it occupied by cars. Definitely a lot of traffic noise at night. Very good option to visit Reus. €9 a day (from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.) If you neglect to pay the fine, it's €6."
24452,2406203,3,dienaumanns,27/09/2022,"The idea was great, after many beautiful places where we just had to keep going because we just couldn't find a parking space, the city thought along with us. The parking lot is not suitable for overnight stays, although it is allowed. It's just way too loud. Bus stop and traffic *all* night."

Lots of cars drive by, I don't like the people either, since everyone is passing through, and there is little communication with each other. It's also very noisy at night and people will park next to you and then be outside talking loudly until 11pm-2am. I do not recommend it."

You have to pay for parking from 9:30 a.m., even on Sundays (at least in summer). It has a supermarket next to it that has bathrooms. The night was quite noisy, but because there was a party in the French town next door. Although from the reviews of other users it seems that it is not the least noisy place in general."

You can hear the highway but more like background noise. Small bathrooms are great for getting ready and were cleaned several times a day. Restaurant food rather mediocre and takes forever to get ready. Bread in the morning was great though.

As negative points I would say that the organization of the bathrooms is strange (shower and toilet in the same individual space) and that the restaurant leaves much to be desired in terms of waiting time. We arrived without a reservation around 12 noon and found a place."

Small negative point: the noise of the highway which passes just above the campsite."

The Autobahn goes right by, but we didn't find it very loud. The place only gets 4 stars, as vans were the most expensive here - more expensive than mobile homes, which is not entirely understandable."

To be a first-class campsite, they should have a water drainage and water loading area that is easily accessible, not like now, and differentiated water points, one for cleaning the WC and for filling with clean water. Terrible state of service area to AC."

24562,3249131,4,maruxxx,02/09/2023,For us an ideal CP with everything you need. Not much going on at the end of August and free choice of seats under the pine trees. The staff is friendly and the sanitary facilities are clean. In front of the CP is a bus stop with good connections to the city. There are e-bikes and e-scooters to rent in front of the access road (via app). Three nights with motorhome 2 people. approx. 103€ including flat rate electricity fee.
24562,3213374,4,himbeerwald,24/08/2023,"Don't understand the criticism. The campsite is relaxed, comfortable and well run. There is also a lot of shade. Beaches and town are very beautiful. In the immediate vicinity of Lisbon, however, not cheap."
24562,3210744,3,Sunny1689,24/08/2023,"Good to reach Lisbon via uber and train. The pool was clean and nice. The sanitary facilities during the day but an impertinence. It is best to take toilet paper with you. You couldn't wash everything with hot water. Beach 1km away. 2 adults, 2 children with roof tent and tent. Five nights including electricity just under €400."

Very shady but the counterpart is that there are trees everywhere so sometimes complicated to park with a CC of 7 m. Located 1 hour from Lisbon, bus in front of the campsite which takes you to Cascais station then train every 20 minutes."
24562,3177751,1,Burbulin,19/08/2023,"The minimum stay is two nights, we only wanted to stay one, when we asked the reception for the price, he told us: there are the rates, add it to you (van number of people)... and he left.

24562,3154684,3,mocudet44210,15/08/2023,Quiet and shaded campsite. Clean sanitary. Only downside 3 nights imposed on arriving on 13/8 modified to 2 nights the next day. Fairly high price for the services offered

24562,3106322,4,gamaliel,09/08/2023,Nice campsite. €42 van for two adults and one child. Recommended to spend the night and plenty of shade. It is the best in the area.
24562,3093568,3,Biscocho,07/08/2023,The facilities are quite good and are quite clean. The only negative I see is the service in the bar/restaurant. You can tell that they are people with no experience in the hospitality industry and the quality of the food is not very good.
24562,3093362,2,olivier16430,07/08/2023,Bof! Very expensive 41€ for 4 with a van. We stand where we want but the locations are badly done often need to stall. Noisy because near the road. Sewer smell in many places. Fortunately the toilets are clean and there are good washing machines. The pool is nice but the pediluve is disgusting at the end of the day.
24562,3091724,2,oscargo85,07/08/2023,"60 euros per night for 4 with electricity... Very expensive for a campsite in Portugal, nothing exceptional to justify these prices. proof in high season there were still plenty of places available, half-empty mobile homes."

24562,3086157,2,jeromeLeGallic,06/08/2023,"To flee. Noisy (group of a hundred young people arriving by bus), dirty or even dilapidated. broken windows in showers not replaced. foul odors in the toilets. toilets that do not close and so on. At almost 37€ per night (van for 2 adults with electricity), this is unacceptable. The only positive point of this campsite remains its swimming pool for the rest circulated, there is nothing to see."
24562,3084551,5,azaerus,05/08/2023,"Very welcoming and French-speaking campsite, be careful the trees are low for motorhomes. Clean sanitary. Restaurant + small supermarket. A beautiful swimming pool with plenty of sunbeds. We had a very good night"
24562,3082420,4,Serbumm,05/08/2023,We were going for one night and we stayed two. Quiet and very natural campsite. Look for your place on the pine forest.
24562,3079575,5,ikaner,05/08/2023,"Very nice camping, fantastic for kids! They have bouncy castles, games, dance in the evening for kids and small playground. A big swimming pool and walking distance to Guincho beach. The bus that goes to Cascais passes just in front of the camping."
24562,3077586,4,flaquinha,04/08/2023,"We came here because it was the only one in the area and we got kicked out from the beach parking by the police. It is quiet and the bathrooms are decent. It is a bit expensive comparing to other campings.. €36/night for 2 adults, 1 dog and a camper van with no electricity included."
24562,3071048,5,huguesbertolin,03/08/2023,"Top campsite in a great corner of the Portuguese coast. Cascais, Guincho beach is surf and cool attitude. Lovely staff, super clean. All amenities with small bar and grocery store. Coffee croissants in the morning. We paid 63€ in a van at 4 for 2 nights. What else !!!"
24562,3066105,5,sarahdly,02/08/2023,"Shaded campsite, in the pine forest (pleasant to have a feeling of nature, not to be on a ""parking lot""). We paid 30€/night for 2 with a car + roof tent. In addition you have access to a swimming pool, a mini market and a small bar / restaurant. The staff is very nice."
24562,3058647,4,barraultceline,01/08/2023,Super campsite. Swimming pool with a paddling pool. playground. We took an uber to go to Lisbon because it seemed complicated to get there that way. Too bad we were next to people who made a lot of noise day and night. The staff hardly speaks French.
24562,3047273,3,itzicl,30/07/2023,"The campsite is very good, perhaps a little expensive. There were 2 of us in a small Peugeot Rifter and they charged us €32. Check-out is at 2:00 p.m., the pool is fine. They are very strict with quiet time. Be careful, the quiet hour is also the camping closing time. They close the fence at 11:00 p.m. If you arrive a little later, as happened to us, you sleep in the parking lot, which I think is very bad because you can't even go to Cascais for dinner"
24562,3041667,5,marinox20,29/07/2023,"We stayed 1 night at this campsite, we needed to use the services (water, drainage). The service area is very wide for CCs. The campsite is very quiet, the pitches are in the shade. Very nice home. Clean toilets and showers. Very nice swimming pool. 20 min walk from the beach. A bit expensive but for this region of Portugal it is accessible 36€ per night for 1 CC"
24562,3032946,5,Oupahein,28/07/2023,"We had a lovely two days. Friendly and efficient service. Clean, quiet camp and clean ablutions."
24562,3018799,4,marleneange74,25/07/2023,"Very pleasant campsite with a nice swimming pool. Few people for this summer period, and very calm atmosphere. Right next to it, a very large, very windy beach for kite wind surfing. Simple but clean sanitary facilities."
24562,3011740,4,ggrout,24/07/2023,"Everything you need, pleasant swimming pool, shaded area but too expensive because 50 € per night for 3 adults, 1 child and a van."
24562,2979635,3,guayoneta,17/07/2023,"Camping between pine trees and sand. It does not have access to the beach. Check out is at 2:00 p.m. regardless of what time you arrived, something I could understand for the bungalows, but to occupy a piece of land with a van?? That seems like an abuse to me and you should take it into consideration if you plan to stay here. Restaurant closed on Monday, the middle of July and few activities for children."
24562,2972240,5,Ksper,16/07/2023,"The staff is friendly the swimming pool is not cold, some toilets need to be renovated not too much noise at night, very pleasant campsite, I love it"
24562,2967138,3,campersitos,15/07/2023,There are no places marked as such. The facilities are good and it has a supermarket and a restaurant in case you forgot something. The site is safe and the people are very respectful. It has a laundry (6 euros to wash and 6 to dry). The hour of silence is fulfilled. A little expensive.
24562,2946982,2,Magicaroma,10/07/2023,"Attention, for those who have a scooter in tow, if you use it you have to pay 5.40 per day, this has never happened to me in the many years that I frequent campsites throughout Europe ... cost per day 32 euros without electricity for 2 people, showers old but functional."
24562,2939316,4,gigino2011,08/07/2023,"Nice nice! Among the dunes, very shaded and very spacious. neglected services; affordable prices. The beach is about a 15 minute walk away. Wonderful sunsets over the ocean."
24562,2916787,3,Tobi21,02/07/2023,"Not exactly cheap, but unfortunately there are no alternatives in strong winds. Overall an average campsite where the sanitary facilities need updating. A lot is broken. But with pool and very late check-out."
24562,2901674,4,maarten266,28/06/2023,Clean campsite with free hot water and shower. Close to the beach. Can be hard to park with a big camper. Bud really nice
24562,2897407,5,chiaraciaffoni,27/06/2023,only campsite in the area between Cabo de Roca and Sintra. We spent the night here and were pleasantly greeted by the lady at the reception who also recommended a very good Indian restaurant outside the campsite. The pitches are shaded and we had a quiet night. We paid 30 euros (2 people electricity) including entry to the pool.
24562,2882224,3,msbulli,22/06/2023,Fine for a stay in Lisbon and Sintra. Proximity to the beach and surf spots great. Space and plumbing for price below average.
24562,2831913,4,domiheyLA,08/06/2023,"The camping is ok, the pitches are free to choose and a lot of shade from trees. Facilities are clean but rather old and require renovation. For that the price of 27.5€ for 2 persons and a small van w/o electricity is too expensive. Thats why not 5 stars."
24562,2831591,4,Davidpe1984,08/06/2023,Super nice campsite in nature we stood in the shade and the birds chirped us to sleep and greeted us happily in the morning really beautiful. Otherwise everything was very clean and everything you need highly recommended!
24562,2815618,4,Vanity90,03/06/2023,"Free choice of place, big enough and nice in the shade. Unfortunately, a lot of resin drips down, but it goes away with warm water. The playground is okay, but the swimming pool is great but only open until 7 p.m. Sanitary facilities reasonably clean, showers come out enough and hot water. Hot water when rinsing, but not for the hand wash basin. van 1kind without electricity 32 euros, fine"
24562,2813077,4,MachuhaSerhii,02/06/2023,"Beautiful and cozy camping camp, high level of service!  Probably one of the best in all of Portugal.  Here there is security at the entrance, a friendly girl will meet you at the reception, and she will tell you everything in detail, the price in the low season is 21€ per night.  Wonderful clean area, pine park!"
24562,2812497,4,joelponpon,02/06/2023,very nice campsite. Friendly welcome. Free pitches all a little steep and low trees but beautiful pitches you just have to look carefully. Clean sanitary facilities. little busy supermarket but very good bread. ACSI price €23 No trailer or other supplement. very nice swimming pool. very good stay.
24562,2811018,2,Robert276,02/06/2023,"The search for a parking space turned out to be the next “hurdle”; despite the plan, everything seemed somehow confusing. The sanitary facilities are as described, in need of renovation, toilets are narrow, cleanliness borderline and the flushing water is cold. The shady location under trees and the proximity to the beach is worth a star for us. 2 people in the van without electricity for €24.90 is definitely too expensive. My recommendation would be 18€."
24562,2810593,2,Mzelou,01/06/2023,Shady and pleasant campsite but they overbook. Some small motorhomes and vans have gone around 5 times and left. Unfriendly staff.
24562,2797580,4,phyllbobaggins,29/05/2023,"Pleasant campsite right on the dunes, lots of trees to negotiate especially if you arrive late in the afternoon. Great for exploring the coast with a walking path right next door. Services are a little shabby but work"
24562,2784004,4,AylinKr91,25/05/2023,It is very nice to stand here under the trees. We paid €32 with a dog. For the condition of the area we found the price to be a bit too expensive. But you can reach Cascais via a bike path in less than 30 minutes.
24562,2773061,3,ChrisGew,21/05/2023,Value for money is not right. Good location but place is showing its age and just okay clean.
24562,2753097,3,traveller20,16/05/2023,"The place was ok. Altogether shady places, but everything was very disorganized. The facilities were relatively old and a little ugly. Electricity was available, WiFi only at the reception and in the coffee shop. Big drawback: resin fell from the trees all the time, so that after one night our car looked like it had been sprinkled with honey."
24562,2751964,4,LarsSchuermann,15/05/2023,Nice and clean campground with lots of shaded areas.
24562,2748660,4,lisabe29,14/05/2023,"Nice place. Toilets clean and paper available. The showers are really old, but the water is really hot. There is a shop with sundries and baked goods. Free seats. We paid 29€ for one night, two people with electricity. Not very cheap and an hour's walk to the center."
24562,2744144,2,AdelinoCosta,12/05/2023,"2 adults, motorhome, electricity, 2 dogs, €38.10 per day, very windy location and very difficult to park, old but clean toilets, friendly reception staff, ASA, for motorhome maintenance"
24562,2723451,4,ManilaTao,04/05/2023,Nice place to check the sorroundings. Toilets and showers were old but clean. Beach is 15min walk. Just 4 stars because the place was full of moscitos when we’ve been there (beginning of may) which wasn’t good with a baby and also annoying.
24562,2723450,2,SylvieMartin,04/05/2023,"Expensive campsite. 4.50 euros because I had a scooter in the hold. They even charge for the cats, the showers and toilets need to be redone, when we left at 2 p.m. the toilets were still not cleaned. On the other hand there is a lot of shade and that is the positive point. The staff is not friendly. 35€ for a night without electricity with a scooter and 1 cat, 2 people and 1 camping car of 6m50"
24562,2720823,2,SilvioBondim,03/05/2023,"I was there in April/23. Photos are better than reality. The beach is far away and I felt deceived by the advertising on the Camping website. Not very helpful staff. Many trees in the parking spaces, which makes maneuvering motorhomes difficult. I took 21.60 for the vehicle 2 people (without power)."
24562,2711495,5,Velta90,30/04/2023,Perfect. clean and neat toilets and showers. very quiet and peaceful all day long. got a really nice place between pine trees with varying sun and shade throughout the day. they have a swimming pool. is recommended.
24562,2706402,4,acdcwh,29/04/2023,"Ideal for a city visit from Lisbon. Stupid that you can not come from the campsite. Except at the reception, you can't walk the dog from there. Otherwise everything is average."
24562,2703174,3,OvalCarpenter,28/04/2023,"Campsite with pitches complicated by trees, sand, slope. Poor lighting at some points at night. mosquitoes."
24562,2699606,1,aoberson,26/04/2023,"Very disappointing, we were asked 62.20€ for 2 people and 2 nights with impossible pitches under the trees even for a cc of less than 7 m. We left, we were refunded without problem."
24562,2696289,4,Charlie0604,25/04/2023,"The place is ok. The sanitary facilities are clean, I recommend taking the shower house at the bottom of the entrance, it's less busy there. Places are freely selectable and quite adventurous to find one between all the trees. Otherwise, I find €23 with ACSI discount for this place too much, €20 would have been enough. Accept it because there is nothing else just before Lisbon. It was OK!"
24562,2669163,3,happyholiday2022,14/04/2023,"Campsite ok, sanitary old but clean, only a little water comes out of some showers. The beach is about 1 km away, not ideal with children. WiFi only at the front of the shop/reception. Beautiful romantic conifers on the squares. 58€ for two nights + electricity."
24562,2651378,4,EmiVisser,08/04/2023,"A nice campsite to stay a couple of days. The walk to the beach is lovely and you can grab a nice coffee! The spot is for the more experienced surfer, but also great to watch. The campsite has everything you need. Take a good look while picking a spot, due to trees and some spots are small. Overall lovely stay and friendly people at reception. There are bikes for rent if you download the app."
24562,2649669,3,StefanLaura,08/04/2023,"€23 pn with ACSI incl electricity. Swimming pool is open since yesterday. Plumbing works fine, outdated, but nice shower. Places are very variable. Went to Lisbon by bus and train from the campsite."
24562,2611524,4,matemalin,16/03/2023,"Nice campsite with lots of shade between pine trees, sanitary is old but clean (could be renovated). Walking distance to the beach & very easy access to Lisbon by train & bus. 2 people & small van & electricity 22 € per night - unfortunately a bit expensive for the low season. Washing machine €6."
24562,2594725,4,VeniVidiBibi,01/03/2023,"Good campsite, all facilities work, if a,little dated.
Great location for visiting Sintra or Lisbon by bus or train.
acsi accepted €23 for van, Ehu, 2 people, and the dog. Natraj Indian restaurant was good and just a short walk, did takeaway!"
24562,2591441,3,ColleBol,26/02/2023,"Good starting point for cycling to Cascais, or to go to Lisbon by public transport. Drive carefully with high campers due to low trees."
24562,2590865,2,Berrylousain,25/02/2023,Expensive campsite for the season. 12€ will still cost you to wash and dry your clothes. some toilets and showers do not close at all. many shower heads are catastrophic and do not allow you to wash properly...
24562,2586318,5,noursenoune,21/02/2023,"We like the welcome, the setting, the fresh bread every morning, the discovery of Cascais, a beautiful chic town in Lisbon and 800 m from a wild and superb coast … perhaps a little expensive for the season …"
24562,2545742,3,BJB8586,07/01/2023,space is ok. Sanitary old but ok. Seats quite tight. Unfortunately a bit far from the beach.
24562,2543928,2,rachelpitard,06/01/2023,"We stopped there to take a shower, 5€ per person, it's really not cheap especially given the quality of the shower. The night is 17€ for two people without electricity, we went our way"
24562,2538237,4,poobly,02/01/2023,"Good camping. Nice set up, the trees are low so 80% not suitable for over 3 metres.  No direct access to the beach, it's a 20 min walk. Showers and toilets are dated but clean. There's a coffee shop/ snack bar and a convenience shop onsite."

Mini Market & Cafe (closed on Mondays) with fresh rolls without a reservation unless you want a lot. Showers are old but very clean & hot. Service area for WoMos is great. To the beach about 15 minutes €15.65 for 2 people with a van without electricity. Dog €2.30."
24562,2504445,5,al11370,24/11/2022,"Campsite well located a few minutes from Gincho beach and Cascais by the cycle path. Ideal location to visit Lisbon, 8€ from UBER to reach Cascais station where the AR is 5€ for Lisbon. The pitches and the service area of the campsite are accessible for large motorhomes up to 9 meters. Pay attention to the height of the trees, 3.6 meters maximum."
24562,2495715,4,ashbymorf,14/11/2022,"The reception is welcoming and organised. Cafe and shop on site.  Toilet blocks a little dated but perfectly useable. Lots of space, but lots of trees around. The shower is push button, but adjustable, the water was hot. Walk to a massive beach, but quite a walk back up the hill. Great old, quirky hotel, at the bottom of the hill, reasonable prices and great view. Bus stop outside camp."
24562,2475009,5,FormatFamille,31/10/2022,"In the top ! We had booked via the internet thinking that there would be no more room as it was indicated on the site but it is huge and there is plenty of room. There are even baby baths and that's great, thank you. 6th laundry and 6th drying, expensive but convenient. Possibility to go by bike via the cycle path or by ubber to Sintra, Lisbon."
24562,2453492,5,LuziaHelmberger,20/10/2022,"situated on a very nice beach (only about 15 minutes walk through a dune). Bus stop right in front of the campsite, so good public connections to Lisbon. You can also be in Sintra or Cabo da Roca in twenty minutes. Nice playground and pool. We stood very idyllically under old trees, with really big motorhomes you don't stand in quite so nice places."
24562,2450918,3,Pistacchio2023,18/10/2022,"The campsite has a great location, very near to the beach and to cascais or Sintra. However the toilets and the showers were very dirty, until now the dirtiest campsite that I’ve been to. The cleaning lady came everyday, but she did not really clean and on top of that she never refilled the hand soap. For the price (23 € per night with a van, electricity and two people) it’s not what is expected."
24562,2447069,4,mafude,16/10/2022,"Good camping, with enough services. Individual level plots, with power outlet, water and camping table. Nice stopover place to visit Lisbon."

Clean and spacious bathrooms, very friendly staff. 2 nights with Camper, 2 adults, 2 children 5 and 6 years old for €56, without electricity. The rate is the same at all Orbitur campsites. Beach 20 minutes walking or 5 by bike, the bike path passes by the entrance. windy beach"
24562,2287239,5,Gogol89,22/08/2022,"We only spent one day but enjoyed all the amenities. €50 (2 adult dogs in a camper). Very friendly staff, very good bathrooms, they have everything we need to make life easier."
24562,2260808,4,watside,18/08/2022,"Well organized campsite, with many places and the possibility of arriving late. The only flaw is that there are no fixed spaces for cooking and washing dishes. Bathrooms not always very clean."
24562,2260309,3,SimonBerlin,18/08/2022,I agree with the previous speaker.
24562,2229339,3,scje01,13/08/2022,Basically a nice campsite but the sanitary facilities are in a very bad and dirty condition.
24562,2204138,4,martaklerap,09/08/2022,"2 adults, 1 night, car and roof tent on it with electricity 32.90€, it was ok for 1 night, but too expensive. Because, if i compare with campsite at Faro where we stayed also 1 night, it was 19€ with electricity and cleaner than here. Sanitary facilities were old, but ok. But positive that they have so much space for each, it is not too crowded, there is also pool."
24562,2195694,3,hipsterico_perdio,08/08/2022,"Spend one night and the campground is Comanche territory. Everything is free camping with which, if you arrive late like us you have to look for life to find a hole that there is not and everything is uneven. Bathrooms not very clean. The good, the proximity to see Cascais and Estoril"
24562,2188943,3,lionel34630,07/08/2022,"limited campsite, admittedly random pitches haphazardly, sanitary facilities really very limited. clean swimming pool The worst is the restoration, the snack bar is really not worth the detour."
24562,2188558,3,YpoFirst,07/08/2022,"we stayed there for 5 nights. it seems that the staff can speak French depending on the client. shame. the pitches are not easy to access for large CCs, you have to be careful. the football field is not freely accessible, you have to ask for the key, too bad. The toilets do the job. In summary, a bit expensive in view of the overall services (45 per night for 4 with electricity)"
24562,2175871,5,brayda,04/08/2022,Super campsite with everything you need in terms of services for motorhomes. Well shaded at the edge of the Atlantic so fresh and pleasant. The staff is really nice. We spent 3 nights there with 2 adults and 2 teenagers in a motorhome of +6m for 156€. I admit a little expensive but a lot of benefits.
24562,2172373,4,A.HAMEL,04/08/2022,Nice campsite with a swimming pool. For a car pitch with roof tent (CC of less than 6metres) we had it for €28.60 with two adults. some showers are poorly fixed and the other problem is that the wind enters the campsite. We had been there to protect ourselves from the wind but it was still present. I recommend for 1/2 nights.
24562,2157682,4,cedlae86,01/08/2022,"Nothing to say about the campsite, beautiful swimming pool, sanitary facilities a little aging. Price: €45 for 1 van, 2 adults and 2 teenagers."
24562,2152196,2,SergiCalata,31/07/2022,"€34 night, two people and camper, (without water or electricity) quite expensive, positive part: the shade, not much, the toilets and showers are regular but clean enough."
24562,2143664,2,davit55,30/07/2022,"€8.10 for a shower. We would have preferred you to tell us that it is not possible to take a shower before collecting that money. In the end we slept there for €34 (Two people + Van + Electricity) but the trees expel resin and they annoy the van, be careful. To shower in that area at the Bar do Guincho they have hot showers for €2."

24562,2127149,5,Wingmen,26/07/2022,So far the most beautiful/best Orbitur CP we are standing on. staff very nice. Shady places under pines. Sanianlagen compared to the other very good. Even with soap and paper. Walking distance to the beach.
24562,2103149,5,Ambrogio90s,21/07/2022,Has everything you need and close to the beach
24562,2101576,4,Flololivi,21/07/2022,"Quiet campsite, very shaded and free pitches. Sufficient number of sanitary facilities. The hours of cleaning not adapted and relative if one does not seek perfection. Great pool and friendly staff."
24562,2099218,5,SusannaAmala,20/07/2022,"the campsite is in a beautiful pine forest, very close to the Praia do Guincho, reachable on foot, by bike, (there is a long cycle path), or by the bus that stops right in front of the campsite and with which it is very easy to reach Cascais. Value for money ... Super !!!!"
24562,2076138,4,Ryline25,15/07/2022,"Nice campsite, sanitary facilities a bit old but clean with toilet paper and seat protectors. A cycle path that runs along the edge of the ocean to get to Cascais. 1 night stay in early July 2022."
24562,2031980,4,VeroniqueManiere,02/07/2022,"pleasant campsite and charming receptionists! the camper pitches are delimited and of correct surface. A cycle path at the entrance of the campsite allows you to go to the beach or to the center of Cascais. it's steep, the electric bike is welcome. Bus and train to get to Sintra and Lisbon. Nice step!"
24562,2019637,3,scheina1605,28/06/2022,Value for money doesn't fit here. Sanitary facilities getting old and partly dirty. Bread service was good and tasted great.
24562,1997068,3,S.Wegner,21/06/2022,"Bread service, bar and pool. However, nothing justifies the very high price. €27.25/night without electricity, 2 people and a T6. The sanitary facilities have been cleaned but are older. Maybe the connection to Lisbon is good, we didn't want to go there."
24562,1987624,3,loppieontour,18/06/2022,"Price too high for how this place looks. Plumbing is very old and run down. 20 minutes walk from the beach, good bread service in the morning."

24562,1985174,2,bringusthathorizon,17/06/2022,Stayed 06.22.OK but price extortionate for the standard of site.Nice pool but shower blocks run down and dirty.Pitches odd shapes and sizes due to trees.We are okay in our VW T5 but saw bigger motorhomes struggling.Advertises it’s close proximity to the beach but actually a good 20 min walk down the main road and then a long boardwalk to the sand. Nice sunset over the sea though from the beach.
24562,1978805,5,MariaFeria,15/06/2022,"It has all the services, clean bathrooms, very quiet and safe area"
24562,1973834,3,AnnDomonTour,13/06/2022,The complex itself is really nice with all the low trees. The washhouses are getting old and not really clean. Not even after “cleaning”. Super nice beach about 15 minutes walk and quite steep away. Nearby is also a dune landscape that is worthwhile.
24562,1943454,3,Crafter2014,03/06/2022,Sanitary facilities getting old but still okay. Some of the pitches are only suitable for small vehicles because the trees are very narrow and low. The pool is very good and the beach can be reached on foot in about 15 minutes. Very nice beach.
24562,1929918,3,CageE,29/05/2022,"Looks like a nice camping site. We did only water service though for 8€, which I think is too expensive"
24562,1915080,5,Englandscamper,25/05/2022,"Large campsite with good facilities - lots of showers and toilets that are all cleaned regularly. We had power and water on our plot. Great base for heading into Lisbon, we got a bus to Cascais and then a train from there into Lisbon."

24562,1859532,5,LuciaProppe,29/04/2022,"beautiful campsite with a few pitches with a view of the sea, everything in the semi-shade and a large selection. Very good sanitary facilities, with showers that are finally forever warm. WiFi in the café, friendly staff, hand or machine washing options. 21.85€ for 2 people with van and without electricity."
24562,1845167,4,Dorkin,22/04/2022,A good campsite offering shade and clean facilities. Staff were friendly and helpful. Location is a bit far away out but is on bus route and cycle lane. Cost for 2 nights x 7m van  2 adults was €55.8 incl electricity.

Taxi from the center to the campsite around 5 euros for two people. You can go there with your eyes closed. Have a good stay"
24562,1782490,5,JanaDiele,13/03/2022,"Very nice staff, quiet location under beautiful trees. Toilets and showers better equipped and cleaner than on previous campsites! With restaurant and mini market. All you need!"
24562,1781374,2,Knoffoff,12/03/2022,We are now 2 months traveling in Spain and Portugal. This campsite is the worst and at the same time the most expensive that we have visited on our trip.
24562,1775766,4,fipsii,06/03/2022,Stayed for three nights in total. It’s very clean and the staff was friendly. We were just surprised that the washing machines cost 6€. Used the e-scooters in front of the Camping to get to the city. There are some good restaurants nearby.
24562,1740060,5,Perryneta,23/01/2022,"We were in August. Good place, nice, a short walk from the beach, which has beautiful sunsets. Friendly staff, small supermarket that does the job, good pool."

24562,1705656,4,teeneeweenee,07/12/2021,"Sanitary clean, WiFi only in the reception area. Receptionist rude. Places under pine trees okay. No direct access to the beach. Totally okay for one night. 1 night, 1 person VW bus without electricity 10 euros"
24562,1702529,3,Ladde,03/12/2021,"We stayed for two nights. Unfortunately, all the pitches are uneven and under trees. The path to the beach is 800 meters. The sanitary facilities were clean."
24562,1696503,4,gyzmo35,23/11/2021,"The welcome is very friendly, camping in the middle of the pines, so be careful with the branches. A little far from everything and a little expensive for the season, since everything is closed, swimming pool, entertainment etc ... 22.85 per night for 2 with a dog.Beautiful walks and beach 800m away."
24562,1691387,5,randgeronetouchoup,17/11/2021,I recommend this campsite very well and well placed cycle paths at the exit of the campsite
24562,1680656,5,DiegoZapatero,07/11/2021,"Perfect camping to spend the night and see the area of Cascais, Cabo de Roca, etc. All services, friendly people and clean bathrooms. Without a doubt a very good choice. It cost me € 10.80 (1 adult 1 van) each night (€ 4 electricity). Watch out for tree branches for tall vehicles."
24562,1679015,5,TchoOoaa,05/11/2021,"We don't often talk about it, but a very beautiful cycle path makes a 10 / 15km loop (depending on the route) and passes in front of the campsite, the beaches below, joins Cascais and allows you to return via the ""city"", very nice, uneven but really nothing inaccessible."
24562,1669494,4,LESDODUS,30/10/2021,"We went there only to use their services (emptying, filling). The price was € 4.50. We had breakfast and the staff were lovely."

24562,1663433,4,Camper-Ria,26/10/2021,I'm here at the end of October and paid 10.80 euros for one person and a van with electricity. The price is amazing and the camping is really nice. You can even choose your own place to sleep.
24562,1644858,4,JLFC45,14/10/2021,"Off season, van price + electricity 2 adults 1 child 20 €. Very nice location between the pines, shaded with all services, clean with games for children and mini-market, restaurant."
24562,1643907,3,Corlissa,14/10/2021,"Well located campsite to visit various nice things (beach 15 min, center, Sintra, Lisbon). You really do need a rental car or Uber to visit these things and supermarkets, almost nothing is within walking distance. The plumbing is very outdated but works, friendly staff, swimming pool unfortunately closed. The houses are really terribly old and soberly furnished, not properly cleaned, dusty blankets, no lamp in the bathroom, jammed doors, etc. In short, far too expensive (even in low season) for what you get."
24562,1636924,4,natxoykeren,10/10/2021,"The campsite is very good, the toilets very clean, with soap and paper, and hot showers. Next to the beach, and 8 minutes from Cascais center. The price is higher than in other areas of Portugal, but reasonable: a camper, two people and a dog, two nights € 41, in low season. Open all year. Of course, there are many mosquitoes depending on the area where you put yourself."
24562,1634211,3,tinawheatley,09/10/2021,"Staff not very welcoming or kind. Site expensive for what it offers. Pool is nice but closes in October.  Washing machines good but one drier for the whole site isn't enough!! Beach over 1k away, no dogs allowed! Cascais hard to reach ."
24562,1621124,4,Merychus,01/10/2021,"A beautiful place, with a swimming pool and a bus that takes you to Cascáis every hour in the morning and every two in the afternoon, silent, the bathrooms I expected better for the price, watch out! They forbid the use of hair dryers in the bathrooms, in very quiet September."
24562,1618159,4,bluelilly,30/09/2021,"Out of season really nice, then for 20E for a 2-person van (without electricity). A small snack bar and convenience store, nice location between the pines, just the Saintaires could be better for the price. Watch out for mosquitoes, we were massacred ... and that even during the day!"

24562,1588078,4,DieSchachmanns,18/09/2021,Nice and clean campsite. mostly nice staff. Just a little winding. very flexible choice of seats!
24562,1578383,5,lebensverliebt,14/09/2021,"Super nice and clean campsite! Sanitary facilities and options for washing up are great! Very cozy in the middle of the pine trees. We were only there for one night, as it is very expensive (two of us with a van paid € 37 including electricity)."
24562,1571186,4,andylili,12/09/2021,"Very nice campsite, nice shaded / quiet places. Friendly welcome (super cool and efficient girl with dreads). Nice play area for children and beautiful swimming pool. Restaurant, store / clean toilets."
24562,1548015,1,Go4tty,05/09/2021,"Expensive camping. Average sanitary facilities. It is difficult to park and you should definitely not come back after 11 p.m. We arrived at 11:05 pm and were prohibited from joining our location. To compensate, we could sleep gracefully in the parking lot outside without being reimbursed. At 30 euros a night outside the campsite, it's not cheap. Finally, the manager is a litigator"
24562,1544567,1,chrisetbruno,03/09/2021,The price for a 7 m cc for one night 38 with electricity in September a little too touristy
24562,1518436,4,nrion21,27/08/2021,"2 nights spent on site, correct sanitary facilities, very nice swimming pool + large paddling pool and small children's play area. Guincho beach 5 minutes by car, paid parking. City of Cascais 10 minutes away."
24562,1504375,5,alex64600,23/08/2021,"A very pleasant campsite with plenty of shade a pretty swimming pool with games for children. The sanitary facilities are a bit dated and could do with a bit of updating, but overall correct. Plus a beautiful cycle path at the exit of the campsite allows you to go down to the beach and cycle along the coast."
24562,1450299,5,FrancescMR,13/08/2021,"I called to ask if I could use the facilities of the motorhomes (emptying / filling of water) and they have told me that there is no problem, their price is € 7.9 and they require negative PCR or COVID certificate. I have not spent the night, I do not know how the campsite works and the quality of its instructions. With regard to the facilities of the motorhomes, correct."
24562,1419298,2,viensonlefait,07/08/2021,"Not nice, so procedural. A frankly rude person from the bar. We were treated like pariahs because “French people who bring covid to Portugal” Very average sanitation as usual, very expensive campsite. Location under the trees."
24562,1396647,4,mycool,02/08/2021,"Nice campsite with terraced pitches of all sizes. Pool and bar, although the toilets seem somewhat dated but clean. Lots of shade and an ideal place to visit Cascais and Estoril. Two buses at the door. 2 euros for the half-hour bus trip to the Cascais train station. Camper price plus two people just over 28 euros."
24562,1390610,3,Marivivi,01/08/2021,"Very nice pine forest with nice formations by the wind. High price for old toilets, washing machines and toilets. Good drainage area for AC. Well-kept swimming pools and playground. We paid 56 euros family of 5 with AC."
24562,1338402,3,Roelenpleun,18/07/2021,"An excellent campsite, with a nice swimming pool, playground and a beautiful location with all kinds of height differences. The atmosphere is friendly. It takes a while to find a good spot because of many trees. The plumbing is old and tiles are dirty or loose, some toilet doors do not lock."
24562,1317631,2,AxShenanigans,12/07/2021,"Very disappointed.
it's a decent camp ground but expensive for what it is, a basic campground.
we have a tiny van (Kangoo) and they charged us the price of an RV. Some tents are bigger than our van.... the one near Nazaré was so much better and much more decent regarding the price/quality racio"
24562,1302246,3,piazzagiu,07/07/2021,"Nice campsite for a few nights not super easy to find a site because it is difficult to access between the pines, but clean shower, nice bar and small grocery store, a bit expensive for the services."
24562,1300188,4,iaMundin,06/07/2021,"Campsite with a large unnumbered camping area under a pine forest which offers good shade. Correct restaurant, unguarded pool, and decently clean bathrooms.

24562,1222171,5,chusos399,28/05/2021,Fabulous overnight stay. Campsite with a good pine forest that gives shade to all the plots. Close to the beach but you have to go around camping. The plots are not numbered. Very nice and spacious pool. Water filling and emptying services For AC. Good zone. We were very comfortable since it is May and there are hardly any people. In high season like all camping it will be overwhelming. 21.80 pitch for two people and camper.
24562,1152209,1,sunlightA72luxembourg,15/03/2021,Sorry much too expensive for nothing 70 € for a motorhome and 4 people to absolutely avoid the bad facilities
24562,1082690,5,cys,05/10/2020,Very expensive. € 36 ac and 2 pax in low season. It also says that it has a beach and it is incorrect. The beach is more than 2km surrounding the entire campsite on the road. It also says that it has WiFi and only has it in the bar and pool. Washing machine almost € 7. Lots of shade. Very slow reception. For anything you have to wait almost 30 min if it coincides that they are attending.
24562,1082087,3,BoubouchFamily,05/10/2020,"Pleasant campsite after 1 week in the wild. Hot showers and clean toilets, washing machine € 6 clean but expensive. The swimming pool is not heated, the minimarket not supplied, expensive 30 € / night in October small van fitted out with electricity. Overall pleasant stay, however, you have to be transported, family of surfer we had to take the van for each session, 20 minutes walk from the beach by the Dunes."
24562,1067790,3,kuemme607,24/09/2020,"Decent campsite, not cheap. WiFi only at the reception and in the restaurant. Lots of trees on the pitches! Unfavorable for standing with an alcove. Playground closed due to Corona."
24562,1008789,4,RSoftware,28/08/2020,"Overall fine, although it is quite a windy place. Good hygiene. It is true that it is expensive, but the pool and being near the sea have to be paid for."
24562,998298,5,ix1and2s,24/08/2020,"Everything great, very clean, cleaning services come every so often. Lots of shade and very quiet. Very friendly staff. Great pool. If you have to put a but, it is that it is something expensive."

However, the price per night is very expensive. We paid 32 euros for a tent, a car and 2 adults. Pool is incl. This is the ad disadvantage."
24562,977807,5,lurrikarak,18/08/2020,"Quiet and spacious campsite, highly recommended. It has a pool, but it closes at 7."
24562,962146,4,juliebritneytiti,14/08/2020,Few campers currently. A bit expensive for a Portuguese campsite. Pleasant however with a beautiful large swimming pool in which we were almost alone.

24562,854485,4,XorruVan,08/07/2020,"Well signposted, quiet and plenty of shade. emptying and filling of water included in the rate. For one night: 2 adults + 2 children in camper, 33Euros light plot. Pool and services well kept and clean. Corvid19 security measures correct."
24562,813946,5,numendes,31/05/2020,"Spectacular space. there is usually wind, and tall motorhomes must be careful of trees, which are very low. we arrived at the beach with a beautiful walk in the dunes. It is not the best price, and the area for washing and discharging is limited. when we went it was practically empty and didn't affect us."
24562,789443,5,TomAus,01/03/2020,"Awesome campsite with good facilities, supermarket and a nice communal area to watch the football. Close enough to the beach to hear the waves."
24562,775628,4,fatjesus,02/02/2020,"I had pretty low expectations based on the reviews here but this site was pleasantly surprising. Friendly staff at check in, well maintained facilities and fairly decent showers. If you have spent time at caravan parks in Australia you will find it to be par for the course. Take toilet paper into the cubicles with you though, it’s a mistake you only have to make once."
24562,768624,4,snowboarder6,14/01/2020,It's ok. nothing special but clean and not too expensive in low season
24562,751030,4,GoereLG,07/12/2019,"Out of season prices (Dec) per night:
1 adult 4,20€ 
motorhome under 6m including electricity 6,10€
pets: dog/ cat 2,20€

coin for washing machine 5€
coin for  dryer 5€

wouldnt recommend laundry: 2/3 washing machines are out of order, the one that works is really ugly, so are the dryers. I bet these have never been cleaned nor desinfected for ages!! If not in desperate need better don't use it"
24562,736021,5,AndreeaBarbu,01/11/2019,"Cosy and nice park. Electricity included. Decent food at the restaurant (French fries, rice and chicken. And on top, a very good sangria. Would recommend."
24562,696925,3,Jeunette,19/09/2019,"Not the most modern, but acceptable. Still a little expensive (30 € per night) and not very close to the center."
24562,687423,1,alexop12,12/09/2019,"€ 50 for two nights, two people and an SUV, we found it expensive since we do not use electricity or fill water or empty. The old and very dirty showers, they put that clean and it is a lie because the shit of the walls of the showers there was the minimum 2 days. Something good that is close to the beaches and they are very beautiful, there is bike lane. To go to Sintra or ask for a taxi there or go by Bus from the campsite to Cascáis and from Cascáis on another bus to Sintra. The bus is fine but it takes a long time to arrive. I think if I would go back it would be for the beaches, for the rest nothing. It is expensive for what is camping itself."
24562,684855,2,base0404,10/09/2019,"High season: 2 adults van electricity 27€/night 

Sanitary facilities not well maintained and a longer (800m) walk to the beach. you have to find your own spot within the trees as there are no clear markings. Small grocery store was not good either"
24562,676097,3,MrGarbaso,04/09/2019,"Not bad but out of season. In summer it has to be a real chaos since there are no parcels, divisions or bounded areas. Which makes me think that as you leave the visiting van when you return you can find your site “usurped”. Somewhat left bathrooms. Pool included in the price. Two people with a camper and Luz € 28"
24562,676091,3,MrGarbaso,04/09/2019,Good place to go out of season but in high season it can be hell ... The motto parks wherever you want can make the place a hell where to find a place. Otherwise it is fine although there are not many leveled sites. The bathrooms a bit left at least today. Of the price not since everyone understands their economy
24562,665718,4,ltb,28/08/2019,"Nice place, shady and calm, but a bit pricey (~28€ for a camper with electricity and two people).
you do get to use the swimming pool, but the washing houses are a bit old."

Sanitary clean, hot water in the showers. We had a drink at the ""supermarket"" of the campsite and really cheap! We spent 2 nights in peace."
24562,647911,2,breizhil,21/08/2019,"Pleasant welcome, it was proposed to go around and choose before registering. After doing so we did not stay, because not defined places and occupation to 110%! Given period ?. Delicate maneuvers (Discover 73 LM). To see out of season maybe."

The seaside is beautiful, surf beach (dangerous swimming) and very wild. 800 meters down in the dunes very protected to access. After that it's true finding a good place is not easy, everyone comes in after settling and looking at the same time! Sanitary not all new but clean in August. Very calm at night."

24562,555649,3,zamaijr,15/07/2019,"Great facilities. However, organization is lacking. We do not know where to park the motorhome. The service does not follow the Orbitur standard."
24562,555446,5,prol08,15/07/2019,"We stayed at the hotel on 07/07/2019, we made a reservation on the internet, which was more expensive (€ 60.80), at alvéolo 902. It has an excellent leisure structure, a convenience store (open at 10:00 pm) well-kept bathrooms, large shaded area with trees (careful handling), small restaurant, swimming pool. Several water points and electricity."
24562,518151,5,camilathevan,16/06/2019,"We stayed several times in Orbitur Guincho and enjoyed. The place is very big, there is a pool and a lot of nature surrounding the park. We payed 23 euros for two people, a camper van and a dog. The toilets, showers and sinks were very clean. The staff is also very nice."
24562,488984,3,jensen265,20/05/2019,"A little more expensive than the average Portuguese place, but only average sanitary facilities. An early arrival ensures the good seats, because in the evening many newcomers spin longer for a good parking space. The subsoil is partly very uneven, and the wild trees blocked so many potential places. The proximity to the sea is good, and otherwise there is also an effort to keep the facility in good condition. Wlan speed is very slow. (Our ADAC card was not accepted for a 10% discount unlike other orbiter places.) Pity.)"
24562,484699,3,richard14840,15/05/2019,"Not top, all the correct locations are already reserved, far too many trees, arrived at 11am, we had to negotiate hard to have a correct location that was theoretically already booked. Acsi logo at the entrance but no discount."
24562,479040,5,eoternaud,08/05/2019,"Superb campsite under the pine forest, beach and accessibilities by bike path. Good back base to go to Sintra and Lisboa. Perfect equipment. I confirm on the left when entering if strong wind."
24562,474195,5,francis444,02/05/2019,To complete my previous impeccable campsite with perfect and personal facilities very available and polite. For Sintra by taxi to 4 count about 30 euros
24562,474192,5,francis444,02/05/2019,"Impeccable campsite to visit Lisbon and my comment is especially for the motorhome traveling with two vehicles. By taxi to 4 about 32/35 euros to reach the Place du Commerce in the center of Lisbon. In Lisbon in the district Alfama stop for lunch at ""Resta urante"" TASCO DO TURRA 32 Rua Sao Cristovao. A grilled sea bream for 7,90 €."
24562,452472,3,Fidjie,11/04/2019,"Nice place. Hot spot. Cycling path to go to Cascais. Price quite expensive for the period, despite the Acsi map. (he did not take it)"

24562,386095,3,GJR,01/10/2018,"Excellent camping. Awkward that no places are indicated. Reception therefore does not know whether there is room. Facilities are sufficient, not special but clean. Friendly but slow reception."
24562,385722,5,balot78,01/10/2018,Possibility to do all the emptying (without taking a location) for 4.20 € very friendly and speaking a little French.
24562,385371,4,sergio5012,30/09/2018,"To recommend but not in high season because pitches not delimited. Low season € 20 (motorhome and 2 people) with electricity, emptying, water, and everything. Superb swimming pool, wifi, small grocery store, bar and bus stop in front of the campsite."
24562,384059,3,CamperNegri,28/09/2018,"Nice camping if you can take one of the numbered plots. Half of the campsite is unnumbered, we arrived at night and that was chaos, by day everything looks better. Bathrooms a little old, but clean. At night you can barely see anything, it is very dim. The pool is fine."
24562,379140,3,jlc204,21/09/2018,Plots not delimited or poorly defined In July-August it must be a sacred bazaar. Insufficient lighting. very friendly staff and speaking French price for 2 nights 2 adults Van and electricity
24562,372046,5,mauricio-brasil,13/09/2018,"Good camping. A campsite with good parking areas, with shadows. Large and clean bathrooms. Spacious motorhome cleaning area. Places are missing for electrical outlet. Take a big extension."
24562,352151,2,Laptitejule,24/08/2018,"Shady campsite, free and undefined, it's a bit of a mess. Sanitary outdated and poorly maintained. 53 € for 2 nights in a van without elec 2 is expensive paid!"
24562,347946,3,SevGab,22/08/2018,"The campsite is nice: well sported, nice pool, 15 minutes walk from the beautiful beach of Guincho, ideally located near Lisbon (count 1h15 to get there: taxi train) but the bathrooms are not good enough held (only one passage in the day in the middle of August!) and as often in Portugal is anarchy in the locations, they are not delimited."
24562,346742,3,tbu,21/08/2018,"Pleasant camping without parcelling, good pool d 10-19h and the best thing is that the departure is at 17h.Price of van and two adults without light 26 €"

24562,334019,4,nad.dacosta,14/08/2018,"The only campsite near Caiscais. 30, 20 € the camper with two adults and electricity. We just paid in advance for one night and we chose our location without problem for a 6m. Two buses to the city center at the exit of the camp but the taxi is even cheaper if you are two Guincho Beach less than a km.'WiFi but we have never managed to connect."

24562,320835,3,m_agoyer,08/08/2018,"The campsite is quite nice, well wooded and 20 minutes walk from the beach. But the toilets must be renovated and cleaned better, even if in high season, the criticism is more to the campers themselves than camping. It should also be that the plots are a little better delimited, it is anarchy and find a free place is not simple."
24562,315138,2,mobenna,04/08/2018,"Sanitary facilities extremely in need of renovation! Somewhat disorganized as far as the arriving vehicles are concerned ... Even late at night in the dark, vehicles are let in which then wander around and look for a place. Many day visitors seem to be by the pool so it is overcrowded."
24562,314691,4,montague,04/08/2018,"Lots of shady places. Somewhat chaotic due to lack of designated plots. We got in late and had trouble finding a safe spot with electricity. Pool, restaurant and other facilities were nice"
24562,311225,3,mobenna,02/08/2018,Camping is clean - but sandy bottom (quite dusty but common here). Relatively expensive in the cp. to other Portuguese campsites. Swimming pool quite full in high season.
24562,286682,3,caseyabroad,12/07/2018,"The camp ground is nice but the facilities are in need for an upgrade. There are sinks with no taps for washing up? And there is no soap provided. The pool area is large and looks nice though. We paid €25 for one night for two adults, Campervan no electricity which is the most expensive camp ground we’ve stayed at yet in Portugal."
24562,283608,3,claudiadpn,08/07/2018,A lot of people. But close to the beach and perfect for a shower stop and other services (7 € per person for access to services in July)
24562,283006,1,Luca1980,08/07/2018,"We needed to do only CS and in the area is the only point, they have turned up their noses and they asked us for a nice 7,40 €!"
24562,281454,2,Saioalex,06/07/2018,"The campsite itself is fine. You can choose the plot you want. The facilities are good bar, pool and super market ....... There is a bus stop at the door of it that takes you to Cascais. The only downside is that AC 2 adults and two children without electricity € 30, it seems too much."
24562,271019,4,Iisa,18/06/2018,"Good place with full infrastructure and everything you need. Nice bike path to Cascais, good bus connections for Sintra. Not too many possibilities for WoMos over 6m but you can find gaps - very friendly staff & beautiful beaches within walking distance!"
24562,261736,4,Sergio12,31/05/2018,"Nice camping, well occupied for a May 11th. Not easy to park a 7m, but it is feasible. It's clean, the welcome in French and the amenities are at the price level. By cons, the dog at € 3.10 is a bit exaggerated, but hey, it's a campsite and not an area."
24562,257797,3,Mikarond,23/05/2018,"Camping clean but a bit expensive 36 € for 1 van and 4 people, nice pool despite a very cloudy weather"
24562,257467,5,ksmithson,22/05/2018,"We really enjoyed staying at this campsite. The pitches were shady and the facilities were quite clean. There was a TV room with free wifi, a small grocery store, and a bar / restaurant serving a decent variety of reasonably-priced food. The staff were very friendly and helpful - we especially loved the banter from Claudia (who works in the restaurant) as she really made our stay memorable. Great campsite, perfect for visiting Sintra and Lisbon."
24562,245268,4,feya,03/05/2018,Pleasant camping we visited sintra using uber between 16 and 20 euros l too much flight to sintra.
24562,242993,3,Dakar755,29/04/2018,Good camping for visiting Lisbon. Taxi to the train station in Cascais about 7 €. Trains from Cascais to Lisbon every 20 to 30 minutes.

24562,231345,4,claumar,31/03/2018,"We went in to shower, they charged us the normal visit price (€ 6) they do not have exclusive shower service."
24562,228133,4,jm1704,17/03/2018,It is true that camping is good but 20 € day with electricity is too expensive. We must also review certain services. When talking about Wi-Fi differences between only in the cafeteria or right next door and throughout the campsite

24562,207404,4,tanou73,29/10/2017,"Well located campsite, very pretty in a beautiful shady forest. Not really defined location, we ask where we want, which gives a more natural side that we have very well. Also camping very clean and friendly staff."
24562,206766,5,honzalilak,28/10/2017,"I kind of struggled with finding service area for campervans in this area. Since I haven't found anything free, I stopped in this camp and ask if I could use the service area and I could for €4.20. It's not a little, but since there is nothing free around, I considered that to be a good deal. I haven't slept here."
24562,205794,5,tropico75,25/10/2017,"Great campsite under the pines, impeccable health. 6 to 7 € taxi to the train station, 40 minutes to Cais de Sodre, the terminal"

Clean, a little dilapidated health but it's ok. Kids games, nice pool and paddling pool but too cold to test. Cascais can be a good quiet break before or after Lisboa. And it's 30 minutes by car."

24562,108883,3,jackade,05/10/2016,"Beautiful campsite but the camper pitches are poorly defined, the branches are low and the ground is often not very flat or sandy. Well placed if motorized transport: 7 km from Cascade, 19 km from Sinatra, otherwise a little more difficult. Very beautiful beaches 1 km away, very windy, but magnificent spectacle of the ocean. Sanitary facilities correct and clean. Less than €18 per night for 2 people."

The sites are relatively small and we are on top of each other, but they have the merit of being well shaded. Price of 23 € for 2 with a van without electricity. The toilets were not very clean and more hot water for women from 21h ... The beach of Cascais is accessible on foot from the campsite (about 1 km) by a path laid out in the middle of a dune , the site is very windy."

Quiet night and with the company of other motorhomes"

Impossible to sleep with the sound of the repetitive sea cars + trucks + camper that leave them very early (5h) + full of other inconvenience.

24610,2593640,3,ElVeterano,28/02/2023,"Nice enough for one night. In the winter there is very little to attract you to the town though. Nice view of the town at night. Service point all working. Be sure you can get out, the ramp is very steep and there is evidence of grounding from vehicles with long overhang."
24610,2585869,5,MSimoes74,21/02/2023,Quiet and clean place to stop and have a meal. Well attended.
24610,2585866,5,MSimoes74,21/02/2023,"Good place to pass through or sleep, clean and quiet. Along the river that can be visited."

24610,2003874,4,fbrunner,23/06/2022,"We came in with trepidation, due to previous reports that large motorhomes had to hit the bottom to access the lower level of the parking lot (and ours is long and with a low bottom). But, going down the ramp that gives access to the water and eviction services and making the curve very wide, we had no problems. The place is wide and flat, with a beautiful view of the river Zêzere. On the upper floor there is a trash can."
24610,1870709,4,HectorHoose,05/05/2022,Excellent free Aire. Good service point & loads of flat parking all with river views. Some road noise from bridge but quiet overnight. Would benefit from rubbish bins as there are none. Thankyou to the local community for providing this place for us.
24610,1778201,5,hedwigr,09/03/2022,Everything still works perfectly
24610,1754834,4,Statler,13/02/2022,Nice place to stay. The view of the city in the dark is beautiful. There are washing machines across the street and a nice little pastelaria in town.

24610,1663445,3,Barcobird,26/10/2021,We have stayed here several times it’s a nice aire overlooking the river with all services. Nothing to add to my previous review in 2019
24610,1635750,5,carmenrl,09/10/2021,"As the photos are, we have stopped to sleep, empty tanks and fill water. quiet night by the river"

24610,1323749,5,JMCurto,14/07/2021,We spent a very peaceful night. The space is super level. During the day we went shopping in the village. Very beautiful and welcoming. I would like to go back. Thanks to the municipality.
24610,1175029,5,MarcoPVaz,17/04/2021,Quiet place with free water and discharges. Very quiet at night. Supports about 15 motorhomes.

24610,489174,3,Barcobird,21/05/2019,"Although situated next to a road and overlooked by a bridge we had a very peaceful nights sleep. The downside, it is on a two level tier car park, anyone with a long overhang DO NOT  attempt the lower level.The aire with all facilities overlooks the river across to the village of Constancia which is about 5 minute walk. Here there are several cafes, restaurants and you can walk down by the river."
24610,481578,3,AnaSantos,11/05/2019,"Nice area with clean water, grey and black water discharge. Nice view, close to river. Pronounced pendant to enter the area. Easier in the entrance closer to the water facilities."
24610,477553,4,kevrowan,06/05/2019,Goos spot with a Motorhome Point. Don’t drive down the steep part into the car par as you might ground your back end. Work you way round to the left to avoid the risk. Easy walk into town
24610,346987,1,MaJoBruckner,21/08/2018,"Great place as described, but the ramp is so steep and without rounding that I'm sitting on the back and I've ripped away the bumper. Backwards out but it is 20% steep"

24642,3090984,5,LuciaAlbert,06/08/2023,"A wonderful place to spend the night. Quiet, safe, mostly flat and with basic services such as a bathroom and a beach bar that opens first thing in the morning. That yes, they do not have coffee but they are very nice. The best? On the beachfront to be able to take a bath as soon as you get out of the van. I recommend it 100%"
24642,2920369,5,cogulerasfree,03/07/2023,"A place with spectacular views, we slept very peacefully, there is a bathroom in the parking lot, the beach bar closes early and is very chill. and next to it is the natural park to do some rutilla. There was not as much garbage as we read in the comments and what was there was picked up in the morning, just like they washed the bathrooms, the machine did make a lot of noise and it was early. and coverage ok"
24642,2710793,3,LeandroTMN,30/04/2023,Land parking without delimiting spaces or leveling. At tourist times it gets very crowded. There is a beach bar nearby but it doesn't bother. There is no coverage.
24642,2682523,2,ArnaudMar,20/04/2023,A quiet night in a small car park by the beach. Chiringuito during the day not noisy. Poor internet and phone coverage. Start of a beautiful hike in the Cale Blanque park.
24642,2674281,3,Lidiali,16/04/2023,"The site is not bad when we arrived it was a bit soulless, it is not very level. That if it is on the beach and there is a beach bar that is now closed."
24642,2650791,5,espeyreinazafis,08/04/2023,"We spent one night here and we loved it! Very nice place, with a place to park almost on the beach. It has a place to wash your feet, a trash can and a snack bar, but there is NO coverage. In the water you can see a huge drain pipe that has been damaged for 2 years from what they told us. From the beach there is a hiking trail towards Calblanque."
24642,2591728,5,Piusweetdreams,26/02/2023,"In low season it is an ideal place, a large car park on the beach and with access to routes through the Calblanque park. Dogs are not allowed on the beach but on the road."
24642,2566433,5,Carivan,02/02/2023,"A pass of site. Great, very quiet and at the foot of a fantastic route."
24642,2544669,4,KrzysztofKucharzewski,07/01/2023,"A large square right on the beach. We spent a peaceful one night there. Near the beach a bit of a mess on both sides: an abandoned bar and the other being demolished. I do not recommend taking a bath because in the morning a gentleman from the institute appeared, who in a special outfit preventing contact with water (high fishing waders) took a water sample and then quite thoroughly rinsed his outfit under the tap with water on the beach."
24642,2537684,4,madame868,02/01/2023,Nice big parking lot. Is right on the beach and on a great hiking trail; right along the coast. Not suitable for overnight stays (signs forbid it) and police frequently drive there.
24642,2504958,5,camperlovers,25/11/2022,"Perfect place to relax. You can take a beautiful walk on the mountain with unforgettable views. Feels safe, very quiet nights. Waste bins available. Near a supermarket. No 4g range. Lovely swimming in the sea. Dogs are not allowed on the beach, but they are allowed."
24642,2444357,5,janen76,15/10/2022,"quiet night and spectacular sunrise, some fishermen at first. hour. the route of 10"
24642,2436282,1,Andre_1987,10/10/2022,"The truth is that it's a shame how the cove is... many years ago it was spectacular but now it's becoming a disaster... a broken pipe where everything drains from the sleeve, I recommend that you don't swim in this area, better to do one rutita and reach the calblanque beaches."
24642,2425867,5,LuciaLopezJR,05/10/2022,"Spectacular, route, snorkel, level... Ideal during the week and out of season"
24642,2338943,5,Naduski,04/09/2022,"We were at the end of June 3 large vans. Place with impressive views next to a cove, next to the Calblanque Regional Park. It has a bathroom, a water fountain and a beach bar. The police passed several times, no problem. There is enough place, end of June and beginning of July. Flat space can be found easily. The downside, dogs are prohibited on the beach."
24642,2314682,3,viveloscolores,28/08/2022,"Good place, it's dirt and it's very dirty, people throw the garbage and relieve themselves. YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY COVERAGE THERE! Alone in the snack bar. The sea water is cloudy, not for snorkeling, for this it is better to use other coves. You have to wash your feet and a portable toilet. If it weren't for the coverage and the dirt, I would give it a higher rating."
24642,2309458,3,superkiko13,27/08/2022,"Very nice views, a nearby beach bar and a portable toilet (maybe they only put it in summer) the area is a bit dirty and since the parking lot is made of sand, the vans end up like croquettes"
24642,2176543,4,Ricardocaparros,05/08/2022,"Good beach, quiet area. Beach Not suitable for dogs, even if they are educated. Police control of no camping. Beach bar nearby. Hiking trails."
24642,2174966,2,Criisvilla13,04/08/2022,"In the middle of August it is unappetizing, the car park is full, there is a beach bar that takes away relaxation and privacy from the cove, the water is very dirty... it is a good place if you like the mountains as it is close to the Calblanque natural park and has good hiking trails."
24642,2075724,2,twomonkeysincamper,15/07/2022,"Little space to park, you can spend the night without a problem at first, although we went in the last week of May, so it was low season. I put two stars because at that time they were fixing some gigantic pipes that I had taken out of the sea and they were off the shore. To spend a night passing through is not bad, the cove is very beautiful."
24642,1963486,4,Esteban.LH,10/06/2022,It's the second time I spend the night here and the experience has been as good as the first time. Next to my Camper there were 4 motorhomes. The police came but didn't say anything to anyone. Without a doubt every time I pass through here I will stay overnight
24642,1947608,3,Laureliotiti,05/06/2022,Fined for 'camping' civil guard. Me sleeping with the back doors open around 4:00 p.m. I guess my fault for the open doors. Little or no coverage.
24642,1927154,3,peoplecalled,29/05/2022,Ok to stay. Saturday night was a party at the beach club. The beach isn't particularly nice and there are a lot of mobile homes.
24642,1849242,5,solerslr,24/04/2022,Quiet place to sleep surrounded by mountains and with the sea in the background. There are usually more vans and motorhomes.
24642,1738708,5,TomekSalamon,22/01/2022,Super parking. Beautiful trail. Water on the beach.
24642,1735070,3,feedyourhead,16/01/2022,"Steep driveway, difficult for vehicles with a large overhang. Place itself is ok, right on the beach. Otherwise nothing to offer. In winter the sun sets very early behind the mountain and then it gets fresh, so we are further east to a place."
24642,1732937,4,ArielMegi,12/01/2022,A sheltered place from the wind. Lots of local people come and walk along the trail. Poor telephone network coverage.

24642,1706425,5,eagle81,08/12/2021,"Comfortable and ample parking with a fairly wide row in the front line and several more. We have been to the December long weekend and it has been a very positive experience. Motorhome company of Dutch, Spanish, campers, many day trippers for hiking. There is also a beach bar. There are foot showers when exiting the cove."
24642,1674766,4,VANNIA,02/11/2021,"Good place to spend the day and night. Area for excursions. If your thing is to work connected to the Internet, this is not a good place. The signal is very weak."
24642,1644420,5,Escapadasblogger,14/10/2021,"Incredible cove in contact with nature. Extensive parking, you can spend the night and the place where the calblanque route begins. in summer it is possible that there is overcrowding, a beach bar and perhaps it will alter the tranquility more. we went at the end of June and we were fabulous."
24642,1547753,1,txipironsobreruedas,04/09/2021,"A real horror: the fatal narrow and uneven access, the beach too crowded and small, many people who were going to make the bottle ... we fled from there. Dogs are not allowed"
24642,1521552,5,familiasobreruedas,27/08/2021,"We spent one night, we arrived late and there was a pub with a girl singing live under the full moon, I thought the place was very magical. The bad thing about the bottle people outside the pub, but it didn't last long and we slept very peacefully. Be very careful with the mosquitoes, in August they are wild !! Nice place"
24642,1487403,4,celsoboix,20/08/2021,Recommended for spending the night and taking a morning swim. Be careful with mosquitoes in summer because they can spoil your stay.
24642,1481006,5,Jose-Pepe,19/08/2021,"Super recommending site to spend the night. There is no sign that prohibits it. Next to the beach, there is a place for everyone. During the day very crowded and at night somewhat less. There is a beach bar during the day and at night. On the beach itself you can't be with the dogs (but there are coves where you can access with them) at the beach bar, yes, POSITIVE POINT FOR THEM"
24642,1433480,4,danielterol,10/08/2021,"Parking on the beach. They let us take out chairs and tables. It has a toilet and footbath. The police come by from time to time and say nothing. Dogs are not allowed on the beach, but there is a beach bar with a canine area. The beach is somewhat crowded, but not overcrowded. You can snorkel. It has a hiking route through the Calblanque natural park. We came to spend the afternoon, but we did two nights."
24642,1432862,3,jnma-family,10/08/2021,"We spent 2 nights here, there is a beautiful walk to do, it is not quiet to sleep music at the bar and go and Come from campers and cars at night, the parking lot is very dirty there is a lot of garbage"
24642,1424769,5,Leki2020,08/08/2021,"Perfect camper spot, views on the sea, dixi toilet and small bar. Lots of room but many campers. Uneven grounds for some of the parking lot. Hiking path near to it. We stayed for 1 night but could have definitely stayed longer. Right by the beach."
24642,1326028,5,Koez,15/07/2021,"Parking in front of a cove. It has service and Lavapiés (not shower), next to a beach bar. At night, very quiet, but in the morning very busy with cars going to the beach. From there there is a 1.5-hour walk to another cove."
24642,1286947,5,Olaf.In.A.Van,30/06/2021,"Stood on the beach for three weeks. Except on the weekend, when there were a lot of people. Beautiful and clean beach. No services but a small beach bar during the season (from mid-June). Then of course very busy. Wonderful diving spot and starting point for hiking."
24642,1280659,4,martaloza,27/06/2021,"Ample parking on the beach. Very busy in high season so it is advisable not to arrive too late. You can easily take your chairs out, we have not seen that there were problems."
24642,1229337,4,Juanangarcia,31/05/2021,"Very quiet parking next to the cove. There are like two parts to park, one upstairs and one downstairs. No noise and overlooking the sea. From there a route goes to Calblanque. In summer season it would be advisable to arrive very early to be able to park as it will surely be full of cars"
24642,1216807,3,xondi,25/05/2021,"Crowded with Acs and campers on a Friday afternoon, and that is the low season. Otherwise a normal beach. The best, that you are on the first line and its direct access to the Calblanque natural park with beaches and wildest coves."
24642,1152790,4,faurys93,17/03/2021,"The beach is not very beautiful and everyone comes there to piss their dog in the evening and in the morning ...

24642,720512,4,Vanvan80,13/10/2019,To sleep parked as a tourist more and (I think) as close to the park as possible. As a beach it is not very cool but out of the summer season without any problem
24642,651228,4,TuyYo,22/08/2019,"We spent the night of Sunday and Monday and it was very quiet, the bar closes around 9.30 (during the week, we were told that on Saturday they were until 1). A civil guard car passed by at 11, but said nothing, we suppose to check that the bar was closed. As in the whole sleeve there are no showers on the beaches, they are lavapies. Many wasps in the parking lot during the day and water with enough garbage."
24642,642334,3,BusiMtx,19/08/2019,"If you cant spend the night inside the El Calblanque park, it is the closest and more similar place but there is a chiringuito /bar next to the parking"

There is a beach bar that supposedly closes at 8:00 p.m. but closed at 10:30 p.m. because it was the civil guard."
24642,593317,1,choquito,02/08/2019,The problem is that they have opened a beach bar right in the parking area so there is no parking space before. There is still room to park a car. I did not stay at night but it gives me the feeling that music will have until late and especially in summer it will be full of people. By the way the beach bar is called El Palmito
24642,548795,4,tessoliekan,11/07/2019,"Beach is great. Not to crowded, foot showers, garbage bins and a restaurant. There is an awesome walking path into the mountains, only for real hikers, with good shoes ! don't go on flip-flops... (mistake I made). Parking itself is not to big and there are not much leveled spots. In the weekend it can get crowded with cars so make sure you come and go early or late. Not in the middle of the day."

After the Calblanques beaches this beach is OK but not among the nicest in the area. We found it clean however. The trail that starts from there is really interesting you can walk into the Natural Park and to Calblanques in about an hour, which is very recommendable."

24642,415083,3,JuergenD,20/12/2018,"Nice location, but difficult entrance to the parking lot. With our 6,36m van, the exhaust would sit, so we left that. With a shorter wheelbase or high chassis safely feasible."
24642,412765,5,philnath04,08/12/2018,"We spent a night early December, very quiet and nice view. Not dirty that day in any case, many bins installed all along."
24642,411476,5,Yeva_,02/12/2018,"Parked here for 3 nights over the weekend at the end of November. Stunning views over the coast and right at the edge of the national park with incredible hikes and wilderness beaches. It’s about 20-30min walk to an Aldi in the town. There’s beach foot showers and bins and a restaurant in season (closed now). weekend there was a few kids in cars come down late at night but nothing too disturbing. We were alone Sunday night but felt safe otherwise a few campers on Friday and sat. Access is a very bumpy pot hole road, single track not recommended for bigger campervan . And the carpark is up a slope which could be more difficult for bigger vehicles. Lots of dog walkers and fishers come in the day but quiet in the evenings. A really special place would come again. There’s a campsite off the main road that offers water and empty services for 4€ it’s about 10min drive from here."
24642,409225,5,barou,21/11/2018,Parking facing the sea. Very nice view. Many beaches .access easy with a van or car. A little more difficult to cross the small bute at the entry of the carpark in CC .Impératif the walk by the sea on the path. :)
24642,315793,4,Ana123,05/08/2018,"Very nice area, the route that starts to the right of the beach is beautiful, but we had to go there at night because of the amount of mosquitoes that there were (in June). Despite wearing a repellent, it was impossible to be outdoors. It was a shame because the place we loved it !!"
24642,264535,5,Buhostudio,06/06/2018,We have spent one night and no problem. The beach bar was still closed. In high season I do not know how it will be. There is a route walking through the mountain that you should not miss.
24642,247468,4,niko17,06/05/2018,"We put ourselves in the back after the parking, behind the bamboo, quiet night, perfect starting point for the wonderful hike to Calblanque. supermarket 15 minutes walk."

24642,226558,4,gglabm,09/03/2018,"Nothing more to say. Apart from the fact that the motorhomes are accused of all the words, but local fishermen came last night and left on the beach cans and fishing bait, while there were garbage cans next door."
24642,226492,5,sabjetravels,08/03/2018,Beautiful quiet spot unlike the other parkings in town. No facilities. Amazing coastal walk starts from this beach
24642,222050,5,appellover,09/02/2018,"Beauty site, right on clean beach, is cleaned, driveway steep, so careful with long overhang, with us 7.50m went well. The restaurant is closed and neglected, doubt whether it is still open. No toilet, but dirt container. Police come along but no problem. It is a very beautiful hiking area with trails through the mountains with good shoes, breathtakingly beautiful."
24642,213575,4,Spookteam,05/12/2017,"Nice place, quiet and a nice Beach. two areas with a total of about 6-7 places. Local Police had a Look but Continued."
24642,211242,1,zaina,15/11/2017,Hello. Be careful if you have a camper with trailer. The drawbar of the trailer rubs because you have to climb an embankment. Complicated to turn around to leave because narrow. We did not manage to climb the slope. Otherwise the parking is big and you can maneuver.
24642,193335,5,luceline,13/09/2017,"Great site, almost on the beach, clean place, clean the beach early in the morning. Possibility to rent kayaks (40 euros a day 2 places) and along the coast side Regional Park of Cadalbanque, beautiful beaches with very few people (beaches not accessible by car)."
24642,115923,4,mick38,11/12/2016,It looks great especially since there is a footwash. We slept next to a creek where we bathed on December 11th. We have since made the beautiful ride to Cala Blanque on a steep trail in Mtb.

24648,1818966,4,famigago,13/04/2022,"The place to empty water and clean dirty water is not bad, to spend a night and get to know Sabugal, it is fine but during the day a mechanical workshop makes some noise"
24648,1757744,2,MissSchwertfisch,16/02/2022,"There is no longer a camper place, only water extraction and drainage. As already described, the access is very stingy: anything wider than a Fiat Ducato shouldn't be able to get there... Otherwise, a tin hall with a car repair shop has been built on the former parking spaces. Overnight impossible."
24648,1106836,5,LucasE,26/10/2020,"Good area for loading and unloading water. The two drawbacks are ... 1, the inlet for loading and unloading water is very narrow. 2, the taps are very wide mouths (and if both work)."

Small park and very good little skatepark little frequented at 2 steps. For sleeping preferred the service area of Malcata quieter and above all flat. Unlike this one which is not really it but with wedges everything is fine.

The service area is open from 9 am to 8 pm (if I'm not mistaken), and they close the water supply. Soon after, they turn off the ASA lights as well. My only complaint is the lack of bathing facilities for those who live on the road."

You can empty water and toilets, the supermarket with free toilets (yes, without toilet seats) is right there, as well as a cheap gas station. (Only refueling, no shop) It was a bit noisy, but absolutely bearable because of the street. Maybe less recommended on Mondays because of the delivery of groceries to the supermarket."

Possibility of washing your clothes in paying machine. Intermarché open every day including Sunday and public holidays from 8:30 to 21:30 during the summer. Ambient music around 8am. Nice for the night only."

24661,117615,2,Tornjak,03/01/2017,2017.01.03 - Basic area behind the service station or everything is at your disposal to carry out the maintenance of the camper. To stay overnight the holds will probably be needed. We did not stay.

24661,51434,2,marco6673,22/08/2015,Not very glamorous but allows to do the free services in addition to being in a supervised place.
24682,3253571,2,aguere,03/09/2023,Very expensive for what they offer. Plots without shade and to use certain elements of the pool you have to pay extra.
24682,3213486,2,MariaCuvillo,25/08/2023,"It is very expensive, we paid for two nights, an AC with 2 adults, two girls and electricity more than €100. There is no grass on any plot, many very small trees that provide little shade in summer, and at the pool if you want to use its loungers or tables (which are all in the shade...) you have to pay for it, and if not, or you go to the sun or look for a bit of shade from the bushes... it seems a little abusive to me."
24682,3203901,5,CecileChom,23/08/2023,"Very good address, the campsite is near the center (bus at the entrance to the campsite). The pool is large, clean, supervised and secure. The sanitary facilities are immaculate and shaded pitches. Friendly welcome, we recommend"
24682,3182341,4,Fuchsloch,19/08/2023,"Toledo can be reached on foot or by bus. The reception was very friendly, sanitary facilities were very clean and there are large showers. The seats are nicely distributed. Unfortunately, the pool is fenced and there are a lot of rules, but they don't interfere with pure refreshment. Water was clean and not too warm (but I wouldn't recommend a pure pool holiday)."
24682,3155453,2,MoWi1957,15/08/2023,Simple camping.  Way too pricey for what is offered.  Restaurant below average.  (Beef Tataki and duck not freshly prepared and beeped for about 5 seconds in the microwave. Perhaps leftovers from the afternoon? And that for those prices...) Swimming pool without slides etc. Hand in your ticket immediately before swimming.  Wonder if you can swim for a 2nd time?  Toledo cannot be done on foot.
24682,3140961,4,RicheGoose,13/08/2023,"Ideal campsite for visiting the city, the bus is at the door of the campsite. There is a passage every hour on weekdays but on Sundays the passage is less frequent. There is a great view of the pool from the bar and restaurant which is very good"

24682,3048958,2,izon,31/07/2023,"Clean with good facilities. Over priced campsite and restaurant.

Too many rules, it makes the experience annoying.

for example.

no food allowed near the pool except if you pay to have a table, which was not available @ 14:30.

allowed to use the pool only one day if you stay a night.

Pool is open till 20:00 but not allowed to cool down 19:45.

The swimming pool is wonderful. I recommend."

24687,2066461,2,mike31490,12/07/2022,"Quiet night. Water point not so close. Toilets and showers closed both during the day and at night and in the early morning, a lot of traffic and noise in the parking lot. There will be no second experience for us."
24687,2030553,5,cosfg,02/07/2022,"Great parking spot,  5 minutes from ferry, No food in restaurant at 4pm to 8pm. The green area was mobbed with locals sitting out in the sun and swimming. Public toilets"
24687,1969478,5,viepie,12/06/2022,Quiet area with plenty of parking spaces. A few fishermen in the morning but nothing noisy. There is a cafe nearby which offers breakfasts as well as public restrooms and sink at walkway level. Showers are also available but they were closed when we visited. I recommend for tranquility.
24687,1718499,5,Eva22300,29/12/2021,Very nice. Almost empty in December. Public toilets but showers closed
24687,1700685,4,samsimillia,30/11/2021,Perfect place to park if you are catching a ferry or have just come off one. Not the prettiest place but fairly quiet and literally a 5 minute drive from the port.
24687,1095243,2,joelle91,16/10/2020,"Good for a lunch stop, quiet"
24687,752856,1,smallfellowjake,12/12/2019,"Seemed decent enough. This morning a group of 3 people tried to get into the back of our van while we were inside. Moving on, it’s not worth the risk."
24687,618628,5,Kant1,11/08/2019,We did not see any showers.
24687,581406,4,albapla13,28/07/2019,Good place to spend the night going by. There isn't much around but it's quiet

24687,559633,1,Redderslewis,17/07/2019,Do not use this spot we parked here prior to going for the ferry and were woken at 02:30 with the van surrounded by illegal immigrants who were climbing onto the back of our vintage vw camper and looked intent on breaking in. We managed to scare them off and moved to the port and the local police had arrested a large number doing the same to vans inside the port. Overall thirty people were arrested that evening the 15/07/19 and there is obviously a problem with people trying to get into the port and onto the ferry. We are used to wild camping and have been using this app and this was by far the scariest place we’ve stopped at
24687,556992,1,Redderslewis,16/07/2019,"Do not stay here! We were camped up with another van and at 02:30 we where surrounded by illegal immigrants who climbed onto the back of our van a t25 pop top, we scared them off and went to the port and parked there but there had been numerous attempts by people trying to stow away on vans there overnight and the local police arrested over 30 men’s but had to release them. Stay well out of the area and then drive to arrive in time for the ferry. After travelling all over Europe for the last four years this was the scariest time we’ve had."
24687,538284,4,gongor,04/07/2019,"We came on a Wednesday night and first we parked in the back area, but kids came to hang out and we went to the first parking of the curve, as you enter the port on the right, a success, we could sleep the night of pull, no noise or discomfort."

24687,511516,2,BigBertha3,11/06/2019,"Plenty of space and pleasant view of harbour. However, many young men hanging around with periodic police patrols observing them. Lots of coming and going throughout night, not a peaceful night here."
24687,479590,1,Louiseon,09/05/2019,"Pleasant place despite industrial buildings, large parking, police agreement that was there when we arrived, but a continuous engine all night and trucks that come and go constantly from 5am. Pity."
24687,425587,4,Porsche718,30/01/2019,This is a public carpark with no facilities but within five minutes of the ferry port. Close to small village with restaurants and shops we stayed one night without any issues.
24687,372072,4,Ivan74,13/09/2018,"Public parking Without emptying or filling But it has nearby public baths, picnic area, promenade by the sea, restaurants and playground. So it's worth a stop. We were on a Saturday night and no noise. To park we took the first parcels of the right as it is accessed, because it allows to put the back part back without disturbing. Our AC measures 7.10 m and no problem."

24687,151118,1,Sisigreg,13/07/2017,Large parking. Only motorhome but a lot of cars and vans with a suspicious population. Did not stay there. I do not recommend it at all.
24687,150476,4,michnitro,11/07/2017,"Good place to spend the night, quiet and in front of the Port. It is a fairly busy parking lot during the day and afternoon, so it is best to arrive at the end of the afternoon at the earliest."

24688,3022832,5,MarcNahry,26/07/2023,"Very quiet place, nice view, very relaxed people. You can spend one or more days here! Beach ""La arena"" is not far from here where you can go surfing :)"
24688,3014936,3,sensecap,24/07/2023,"Wonderful place with direct views of the sea, free and with water fountains, litter bins and a couple of benches. From now on they no longer allow any vehicle to park at night, from 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. hence the lower score. Too bad, those of us who came to enjoy it in a civilized way lose a great place to spend the night."
24688,2988915,1,gudaworf,19/07/2023,"As I had previously commented, it was sung that they were going to close it, well, as of this Friday, the City Council has declared that you cannot stay overnight and it is prohibited from eight in the afternoon to seven in the morning, all thanks to the anticivil behavior of various groups finally they have achieved it"
24688,2829931,2,natoun50,07/06/2023,"Nice view, but shielded parking, one on top of the other. The dogs in the house behind the parking lot bark every time they pass. Nice for a walk but not to stay and rest"
24688,2798861,5,jurij94,29/05/2023,"Very nice place, not many cars during week and not so noisy that people wrote. Great view, water is here, I love it. People are crazy, if they can write hates about this place."
24688,2707453,5,kiwionavan,29/04/2023,"A fantastic place to spend the night and enjoy the views. Totally recommended. We must be aware that we must take care of these places and not pollute or camp, otherwise every year it will be more difficult to find similar places without prohibitions"
24688,2704024,4,Noelm2017,28/04/2023,"A great view and super good way to walk the dog. Were there with many others. Unfortunately, the dogs from one house on the site howl and bark a lot. Water, garbage disposal possible."
24688,2684574,4,gretawgn,20/04/2023,"A beautiful place on the coast. Super arrival and a pleasant night with many other campers. The downside is unfortunately the dogs, which bark continuously."
24688,2683760,5,Pik24,20/04/2023,"The place is open again for film shooting, and I didn't find the bumpy way to get there either :) No problem coming here with a large mobile home."
24688,2679607,5,nia-974,18/04/2023,"Wonderful place. But at the moment a film shoot is taking place there (no end date), which prohibits access to the spot, we advise you to avoid the area which is full of people. The front parking lot is full tonight! ( here we are )"
24688,2663084,3,hercar3,11/04/2023,"Good rest in this car park with many vans and motorhomes at Easter. Little civility, barbecues, and garbage that a homely man was collecting in the morning"
24688,2648453,5,luckyfreddy,08/04/2023,"The place is basically TOP! If you don't mind that the breeder's dogs next door sometimes bark, you will find a free area that is also used by locals as a starting point for hikes and to relax. Two water fountains available and rubbish bins that are emptied. Since there are no toilets, there are also a few leftovers in the undergrowth of the cliffs"
24688,2520471,5,rachelpitard,12/12/2022,"Great spot for one night, we spent a pleasant night there despite some barking here and there haha. The view is really great"
24688,2480564,4,trips380,03/11/2022,very nice place to walk. nice view. only downside the barking of the dogs of the house which is annoying when you want to rest with the children.
24688,2464443,1,RhondaCamper,27/10/2022,"One of the least relaxing places I've ever been. About 20 dogs barking 24/7, vans packed in like sardines, and gigantic rats without fear of humans running around. Many reviews on here seem intent to mention locals making noise. The locals here are wonderful and have been super friendly, the only problem I see is the vans. After all, the tonnes of used toilet paper is not being left by locals..."
24688,2462380,3,travellingfinn,25/10/2022,"Nice place but too many visitors. Young people coming late and being loud, trash bins overfilled and dogs barking really loud both late and early. We saw a huge rat eating garbage. Police drove by 4 times in the evening but didn't stop."
24688,2446822,2,mathildaholo,16/10/2022,"It depends on what you are looking for in your sleeping spot, there are a lot of vans and motorhomes here, even in mid-October it's armored (50cm type between each vehicle at night). Very busy and crowded. Certainly the view is beautiful but you have to like the camping atmosphere and the proximity. maybe go there off weekends and as said below the dogs barking until 1 a.m. and rebelote at 8 a.m."
24688,2442478,5,NekoNek,14/10/2022,"Site with spectacular views. Flat squares. The dogs bark, but they are far away and in the end you don't even hear them. The atmosphere of regular campers like Sergio make it a safe and friendly place. Let's try to take care of the place. We spent the night very comfortably. There are a couple of fountains and dumps."
24688,2441891,5,Peppie2022,13/10/2022,"Wow! What a spot! Drive to the end. Several motorhomes stay here. The view is great and you can immediately take a nice walk with a view over the coastline! It is very dark. No further lighting available and if we get through the night well, then it is a top spot!"
24688,2390174,4,BobderCrafter,21/09/2022,Very nice place with the possibility to walk along the cliff to the beach. Quiet night. In the evening several people are here to enjoy the view. Absolute place for campers with dogs.

24688,2346482,2,FrediJedy,06/09/2022,"A troubleshooting spot with a view of the ocean for one night if nothing is found in the region. Seats are expensive. Lots of motorhomes and a coming and going of locals (rather normal since they are at home. Rather noisy but subsides as the evening progresses. In short, 2 stars are enough…"
24688,2336684,5,steverins92,03/09/2022,"A wonderful site with spectacular views. Ample parking, with almost no fighting and a fountain. From there there is access to routes to beaches. The only drawback is that most people have little respect for nature by leaving paper and garbage, there being several bins. Luckily, locals like Sergio take care of the space day by day."
24688,2334376,5,sergiokobaron,03/09/2022,"say that this is not an area. It is a parking lot that is public land and there are donkey dogs and this wonderful parking lot where I am every day in my van and I consider it my home I only ask for respect, cleanliness and I repeat noises of all kinds a lot since I do not It's camping. If you want silence, you'll have to go through a campsite. Sincerely, Sergio from Kobaron✌️"
24688,2334028,3,Ita-leo,03/09/2022,"Very tired of what they come to spend the night without a bathroom and do their business leaving papers and human remains, dog owners who leave poop without picking up or pick it up and throw the bags on the ground. Thanks to Sergio and the guys who live there and cleanse the shame of the rest every day."
24688,2324071,2,antoine0506,31/08/2022,The spot is 10 minutes after Bilbao. At first nice because there seen overhangs the sea. In a second time the cleanliness of the places remains to be desired as well as the continuous barking of the dogs of the neighbor.
24688,2323792,3,pierre0433,31/08/2022,"Very nice place, just above the water with paths down to the creek and a hiking route. The parking lot is large, however it is a bit dirty. The dogs on the farm opposite are very noisy, it only takes one to start barking and it's a concert that starts for at least 30 minutes. It is not a place where you will be very quiet."
24688,2320289,5,ferdi187,30/08/2022,"Great spot! Large, relatively straight, great view! The dogs and donkeys didn't really bother us. Police came twice and checked the rights. Worth 5 stars!"
24688,2318519,3,cmarques10,29/08/2022,"Nice view, it's a parking lot. There is a pleasant walk of two and a half km along the sea to the beach (the final stretch is quite a few stairs). Today the night has not been good, the donkey, the dogs and the storm together with the strong air."

24688,2316780,4,MayaHobby,29/08/2022,"The path looks a bit strange in the dark. However, when we arrived there were a few campers here. We felt safe overnight. Just behind the square is a property whose dogs and donkeys are quite noisy. But that's the only thing that bothers you and is made up for by the great view of the sea and mountains. There is also a small water fountain and garbage cans. Recommendation"
24688,2305674,3,Luc1112,26/08/2022,"a lot going on but also a lot of space. Great view and nice paths to walk. A bit littered and the residents' dogs barked a lot and constantly, even at night. It is about a 30-minute walk to the beach, dogs are only allowed there out of season"

There is a lot going on at night, cars come and go again after a short time. The police drove by in the morning, but only looked."

24688,2252906,3,Liliema29,17/08/2022,"Easy access, sea view and sunset, from the evening passage of the locals. Passage of the police morning and evening which is reassuring. Water tap with good flow. Effectively dog barking but quite tolerable."
24688,2241751,5,mgoyena,15/08/2022,Beautiful place where I recommend going from sunset. The time we went it was not crowded and we were able to park in front of the cliff. It had a fountain with drinking water. The only drawback was the dogs and the donkey that made a bit of noise at night but for the views and how beautiful it was it was worth it.
24688,2239666,5,KappaVan,15/08/2022,"Nice, pissing parking lots. Many places. Dogs a little noisy but the horse silenced them. Nice open space to enjoy the view."

Unfortunately, it is a bit littered and the dogs on the adjacent property are almost constantly barking. The pitches are very level and the first row with a direct view of the sea. All in all a nice place."
24688,2228089,4,neledid,13/08/2022,"A very nice view, but unfortunately the parking lot is a bit dirty and it smells a bit. At night, dreams are accompanied by a donkey and a pack of dogs. But we still had a very comfortable night!"

Beautiful sunrise, beautiful views and a walk that does not reach 4km to the beach of La Arena easy, paved, with benches and fountains along the way, ends with a few stairs). To go, sleep, see the sunrise and walk to the beach."

We arrived at the end of the sunset and we were lucky to find it. When it gets dark some cars leave. First thing in the morning people pass by the path but it's fine. It coincided with the big week of Castro Urdiales and we saw the fireworks from here."

One star deduction because at least 10 dogs bark almost continuously in the adjacent house. At about 11 p.m. they stopped and you could sleep peacefully. Nevertheless recommended!"
24688,1767702,2,camillafr,27/02/2022,"Nice view, however we did not stay. I’ve never seen so many locals giving all the vans a meen look… Did not feel welcome at all so we drove on. I do not think campervans are welcome here, never experienced this before."
24688,1766006,5,noa2001,25/02/2022,"A spectacular site, you have to get something early because it fills up quickly. There is a lot of peace and quiet, very good views. A place we will go back to without hesitation."
24688,1765963,2,gudaworf,25/02/2022,"a site that has only a few hours left to put clearance, it is becoming saturated and people are not responsible, I just saw a family that leaves in their AC leaving all the garbage bags and people who occupy more space .., I said, the hours counted"
24688,1739940,5,Joseloi,23/01/2022,"A very nice place to spend the day, with a beautiful walk along the sea. We spent the night there without any problem, although camping is prohibited. We with the van without problems, there were also a few motorhomes. A highly recommended place if you want to disconnect and wake up in a spectacular setting"
24688,1734387,5,martisers,15/01/2022,"Paved parking with sea views. All wonderful, the only thing that fills with people since it is the beginning of a route along the coast. We spent the night here and very well, very quiet."
24688,1727886,4,thetnec,06/01/2022,"The view is truly magnificent. Lots of places. Lots of walkers on weekends. The promenade along the sea is superb. On the other hand, just behind there are barking dogs. And watch out for the wind."
24688,1719101,3,Izarbeltz,29/12/2021,"The place is spectacular to spend the day, we call the local police and ertzaintza and overnight stays are allowed, there were people making fire and with tables and they did not say anything, at night quiet, but 3 stars for a scare we had, one person to late hours nosing twice through the windows of the van and the neighboring ACs, we called ertzaintza and they went around to look for him ... otherwise fine"
24688,1713102,4,dNadine,20/12/2021,Stayed August 2021. Lovely spot.  We stayed one night along with other campers.  Police came round a few times but didn't move us on.  I think you have to park on the gravel and not the grass.
24688,1696365,2,fabiscamperlife,23/11/2021,The spot is okayish.  Kind of busy in the evening. Dogs barking all the time from the property 50meters away. But nice walk along the coast
24688,1647847,5,Babuneta,16/10/2021,"Camping prohibited poster. The place is idyllic, stunning views of the sea, cliffs, wide green area, benches with views, and a Via Verde promenade that starts from the same parking lot suitable for the whole family, beautiful. Very calm. Let's take care of it"
24688,1643889,1,cweber,14/10/2021,Actually a superb place regarding the view and the availability of spots. Unfortunately 1 star because filled with rubbish (mostly toilet paper). We collected a full sack alone. Please please use a shovel when nature calls for the big task and take your paper when nature calls for a wee.
24688,1626543,4,maevaakp,04/10/2021,"Very pretty view. We didn't sleep there, just ate."

24688,1505369,5,CatherinePAUMIER,24/08/2021,"At the entrance, they say that you cannot camp but they leave people with vans and motorhomes. The police go by in case with rounds as it should. Wonderful panorama on top of the rock. Silent, clean. Take a breathtaking walk to a white sand beach (3.5 km of visual, historical and cultural charms). I recommend it 100 percent."
24688,1500469,4,MarcRv,23/08/2021,Great esplanade with incredible views. No problem to spend the night. Highly recommended.
24688,1495714,5,yzanolanstef,22/08/2021,Nice view many trucks eb this Saturday evening but the area is worth it especially in the area despite the prohibitions posted water fountain nearby quiet night dogs had all the same try to preserve the place

24688,1454942,2,pollogti,14/08/2021,"I give it two stars because the site is wonderful. But they will close it shortly: the lack of respect with the site and with the same colleagues (ac / camper, etc ...) is total. Bonfires, cars and vans in the meadow, vehicles that park so close that you can't even open the door ... an absolute nonsense."
24688,1454878,5,Sydney19,14/08/2021,"Very nice spot. The police pass, but are tolerant on condition that they do not spread out. Sign prohibiting camping but no prohibiting motorhomes (…) We spent the night there as well as many other motorhomes and cars (all Spanish). Departure of the hike. Access is now easy (concrete road)."
24688,1452863,5,roadtrip69,14/08/2021,"Great spot, on the other hand, it is a question of arriving early to have space. parking very coveted by all."
24688,1449991,4,Calares,13/08/2021,"Site with very good views and quite level, an eco-operator crosses the parking lot. Although the police often pass it by, people often pass it on about not camping, they pass it through the lining, the majority with the camp set up, some even brushing their teeth in the fountains."
24688,1444425,5,LorenaViajera,12/08/2021,"Spectacular site, in front of the sea. There were lots of ACs, but it is very quiet. There is a fountain and the beach next to it. There is a no camping sign but nobody pays attention to it. It has benches to have breakfast watching and smelling the sea. Very highly recommended, we will be back !!"
24688,1443583,5,Vanthingstodo,12/08/2021,"Great views, plenty of spots. Cares leave at ~7pm, then you can score a sea front spot. Police comes by twice a day, no chairs and table (camping) is allowed. At night some young people came with music but left soon again."
24688,1440565,5,LuluduCO,11/08/2021,We stayed here for 1 night. Peaceful parking lot with lots of spaces. Spectacular view.
24688,1435303,5,Antuning,10/08/2021,"A magnificent place, with unbeatable views and a lot of tranquility. it makes it very clear at the entrance that camping is prohibited, but everyone passes it through the lining ... The police pass by and kindly recriminate those who do it badly, but not a fine, which is what they should do. Then we complain that everything is forbidden to us. let's not be uncivil!"
24688,1432589,5,noiro,10/08/2021,"We have slept many vehicles. The place is beautiful. The police pass several times without getting into anything. If you want a beach, you have to go on the 2.5 km walking route. Or by bike but at the end before the beach you have a lot of stairs. You have to go to the sand beach. The rest is cliff and stones ..."
24688,1432116,4,Nathalie2018,10/08/2021,"Quiet, flat parking with green area next to it. Beautiful views of the sea. We spent one night and no problems"

24688,1418621,4,berlinGOpalma,07/08/2021,We have had a good night accompanied by other vans and Acs. There is a lot of room. There is a water fountain and spectacular views of the Cantabrian Sea. There are several paths that lead to nearby beaches.
24688,1393675,4,HectorHerrero,02/08/2021,Quiet place with good views of the coast. There are quite a few bins and fountain. Space for quite a few vans. The police have passed the police twice and without problems. The only downside is the noise of dogs barking for most of the night.
24688,1391522,5,calichy,01/08/2021,Beautiful views. Green path for a walk near the cliffs. We have not stayed overnight. A lot of movement of people has also coincided with us. There are several sources and bins. A few minutes walk also several bars to have a drink.
24688,1370221,2,MARISATILA,27/07/2021,"Spectacular place in terms of views, but with a lot of movement of people ... it seems to be a very busy area ... we were looking to spend the night therefore we turned around and continued ... I don't think we had rested, everything pointed to what it was going to be an intense night !!!!!"
24688,1364420,3,taupada,25/07/2021,"A spectacular place in terms of views, so if you love being surrounded by garbage this is your place, you have it everywhere and in all colors, wall-e would be like in a ball pool, a shame of place, a lot of movement of cars coming and going, and people coming to eat, drink and leave things to wall-e."
24688,1364309,5,MARIARP,25/07/2021,"Brilliant! We slept in a motorhome the night from Saturday to Sunday. There were many other vehicles. Quiet night, good access and very cool views. Let's respect the environment to continue enjoying it!"

24688,1336031,5,jon_koala,18/07/2021,"Perfect place, the police arrived and fined two vans that had an awning unfolded and outside the parking limits. They didn't say anything to everyone else as we were well parked and with no open windows or awnings."
24688,1334752,5,GuillermoBeltran,18/07/2021,"Fantastic site with sea views. Many motorhomes, but very quiet. We spent the night without problems. Too bad that the surroundings are full of papers of people who go to relieve themselves and do not collect."
24688,1313493,5,nuria474,11/07/2021,"Very quiet place. beautiful views. highly recommended. From the previous comments it seems that we were lucky (we slept on a Saturday night, quite a few motorhomes and cars but no one was partying) It is a shame that people go down a hill to pee and leave paper lying there instead of going up and throwing it at the end of the hill in the trash can. and worse those who leave wipes ..."
24688,1306457,5,habeebo,08/07/2021,Supercool view in morning. There is place on cliff if you dont mind go little bit offroad.
24688,1283068,2,JoanotCastello,28/06/2021,"I guess we must have had a bad day compared to the other people who have commented. Traffic of people until the late hours, cars that come and go until late and people shouting. Also in the house next door they have a pack of dogs that have been barking during the night."
24688,1282564,4,Gutifu,28/06/2021,A quiet and spacious place. With beautiful views and a walk along the seashore.

24688,1233266,4,Tamarindo86,03/06/2021,"Very good place to spend the day and sleep. The views are spectacular and you have a great walk, ideal if you go with pets. It has two drinking fountains. I'm not giving it five stars because at night some cars came with music, they started making noise and drinking next to the vans, I don't know if it's something common in the area. But I would recommend it anyway."
24688,1158180,4,alaitzo,26/03/2021,"A cool place with good views. You have to get into the grass so as not to stand out from the squares, which are short. Penalty of people who leave the engine running for hours ... what's wrong with you?"
24688,1108392,5,tukinga,28/10/2020,"We stopped only for lunch break, but spot is spectacular. Beautiful views, entrance to trekking trail along the cliffs. Would definitely spend the night. We were there in October and there was only one campervan parked. Drinking water fountains available."

24688,1077194,4,luisynoe,01/10/2020,"Quiet place, and the police go through security several times. The path that leads here, if you do it at night it seems that you are making a mistake but not much less, great place and with a source"
24688,1040347,4,camperme,11/09/2020,"Nice views. In the evening, many young people making noise, but they left at dusk.

24688,1011894,2,familiaIglesias,29/08/2020,"Parking next to the cliffs, with fountain and hiking trails, the police pass but they don't say anything. Just to sleep, it is very dirty and at night a lot of work is where cars go for a while. If you go with small children not very advisable."

For the adventurers there is the possibility to go further down a dirt road that really takes you to the edge of the cliff but you have to be sure to be able to come out after. Superb view, very quiet ... except for the dogs of a property nearby (I do not know if we are not lucky but I had the impression that everywhere in Spain that a place is isolated there are dogs that barks ... which spoils a little peace). A bit of a shame for the cleanliness of the place, there were plastic bags and leftover packaging that was flying everywhere."

Overall, the place is highly recommended :)"

Be careful, arrive very early (in the morning) or very late (in the evening) because places are quickly taken! CC of 7.50m OK without problem!"
24836,2186190,5,lesfurets,06/08/2022,"Superb place overlooking the cliff with the sound of the waves in the background. WC in Algeco next to the bar (only summer maybe?). Only downside, two cars that start with a bang to try to wake everyone up at 3am."

24836,1694668,5,nomad17,21/11/2021,Great place to spend the night. It's not very noisy apart from a few fishing cars coming and going. We stayed 2 night and it was perfect. Easy access hard dirt road. I highly recommend. The view is worth the detour.

At first we didn’t know what to think about the signs saying not to drive and park on the cliffs, but in the end we figured you should just not get too close to the cliffs. There were some cars in the evening from fishermen, but they left before the night. It was just us and one other Motorhome. Park a bit higher up to be flat."
24836,1218632,5,Sarahpetit,26/05/2021,Very nice spot! Magnificent view Large parking lot in right sand to put the tent A redo we would put ourselves in the pine forest because a lot of wind and in a tent it is difficult

A couple of cars coming to stop off and leaving shortly after but nothing disruptive. No amenities. In the morning we weren’t expecting the view - it was incredible! Had breakfast to the sound of the waves. Just be careful when parking and moving about as it is a cliff and quite a drop. Visited in January 2020, only 3 other campers around and very friendly. Wish we could have stayed longer!"

Only a handful of level parking spots, area is quite active with fisherman coming and going but all very friendly.

WC with sink next to the lifeguard cabin, lifted in the morning around 10:30 (when we were there) so clean. Place popular with fishermen so the passage but nothing bad. Too bad, we did not enjoy the sunset because it was hazy, but it must be superb. A little wind, difficult to eat outside, but sleep with the sound of the waves, what a pleasure."

24836,123813,4,bernacoul,23/03/2017,"Beautiful place alone in the world. in good weather it must be perfect. On March 22nd, there was so much wind that we had to go take shelter. we will come back to it."
24836,94996,3,ron44,15/08/2016,"Nice place. Perfect to admire a sunset. But not to sleep. Because no shadow / full dodger, no privacy. And obliged to park on the lane part because as shown by the sign behind the motorhomes in the photo, prohibition of parking at this place under penalty of large fine"
24836,90660,4,EnekoSMG,07/08/2016,We did not spend the night but the place was beautiful. The bad wind that hit that moved the motorhome a lot.

Along with several other campers and motorhomes, but at 3:30 in the morning the police woke us up, they made us leave in addition to the €250 fine... Perhaps in low season they do not control so much... Otherwise a beautiful place, next to from the beach, without services."
24874,2234441,1,AniLu,14/08/2022,"Standing at this beautiful place the whole of August 13th, we felt very safe next to the many other campers in the evening and therefore decided to stay the night. The police drove over the square once during the day and didn't say anything to the campers who had set up a small camp. However, they were then rudely woken up at 3 a.m. by a large police force (4 cars) and they were all expelled after the data had been recorded. The place they referred us to was about 1 hour away and when we asked why we weren't allowed to stand in that area, we were told it was POOC area, but there were no signs anywhere. The policewoman said we would be fined €250. Nearby places were also cleared that same night."
24874,2232988,3,yann38380,14/08/2022,5 for the location because just beautiful!! But unfortunately woke up at 2:30 a.m. not the police who asked us to leave because it was forbidden to sleep here.. too bad

24874,1429105,5,eXotioN,09/08/2021,"Very nice pitch! We have nothing to complain about. It was a bit windy, which is why our vehicle got wet and salty due to the break of the waves on the coast.

24892,928759,4,Bodhy,04/08/2020,"Good area to park, spend the night and I would say ""camping"" we have been with a motorhome we have opened the skylights and without problem, for lunch, dinner or breakfast you have tables with benches for it. Good place to do the trail of the Xanas"
24892,918520,4,Mayoamo,01/08/2020,"Perfect for doing the Xanas route. We spent the night without problem with another 3 ac, somewhat inclined but unimportant. There is a bar 50m."
24892,857186,3,pinsmi,09/07/2020,"Two car parks one behind the other. We took the second one a little further from the road. In combination pay attention to the floor lamp which spits well. We enter the road a little, but it is above all the many barking dogs that we generated at night. On the other hand, the Xanas path which leaves from this car park is magnificent"
24892,855351,5,Parte,08/07/2020,"Quiet place at night, we were alone together with a camper car. The source does not work, the garbage if they are."
24892,631390,3,esobus,15/08/2019,We were looking for a place to sleep. We went our way.
24892,571712,3,fcoramir,23/07/2019,"We have stopped, but in the end we have decided to move on. We were alone and the recreational area is small and full of grass. little cozy. better to move on to the recreational area of the buyera."
24892,527708,4,pvlk,25/06/2019,Have not stayed for a night but recommended the hike. It's only 8 km and very beautiful.
24892,464756,3,bea82,23/04/2019,"Small parking lot with incredible views. Ideal to make the route of the Xanas and next to the path of the bear. There are not too many places, about 20? On holidays it can be very complicated, better to park at the last minute. There is water, tables and a bar in front (which closed very soon in Easter, there is no fuss)."
24892,181877,3,Gustavogr,22/08/2017,"Source with drinking water crossing the bridge that is next to the rural lodging. Area with picnic area and containers. There is a bar nearby. In the morning there is a lot of movement, since it is the beginning of the route."
24908,3233525,4,Nini11189,29/08/2023,"Very nice pitches under eucalyptus trees or right in front of the beach (there are about 6 RV sites and many other normal parking bays). Nice playground at the ""lake"". Perfect for children except the adjacent bar which is a bit louder. We were there on Mondays, but it was quiet there. Dogs forbidden, but ours was tolerated. Outdoor showers, the toilets were unfortunately closed."
