105198,1865551,4,Evoist,02/05/2022,A good pitch for the night. Lots of parking next to a church. Slightly more traffic than the previous comments suggested. A little hint: At 4:30 a.m. the lawn will be blown up. We were very shocked when our vehicle was also watered :)
105198,1837709,5,220658,19/04/2022,superb car park where we went to shelter from the wind of the coast for the night. We haven't seen any bans.
105198,878066,5,jorconde,18/07/2020,Nice and quiet with good shadows
105198,765733,5,MaxGemperle,07/01/2020,"The square is on the outskirts and there is parking for the church ""Nossa Senhora de Vagos"", which was built at the end of the 12th century. It is a beautiful facility."
105200,3146760,3,joanjo,14/08/2023,"Shared parking area with tourist cars ideal for visiting the source of the Ebro River. The places are narrow, but you can take the bus places without any problem."
105200,3007199,4,PabloAngulo,23/07/2023,"Shared parking with other vehicles. Good to see the source of the Ebro, and rest in the picnic area. Pretty steep to spend the night. Fontibre restaurant next to the parking lot, we went with two children and they served us as 10!!"
105200,3003180,5,AinhoaKamper,22/07/2023,"Ideal for having a picnic at the picnic tables and spending the afternoon. Source of the river with ducks, shadow and nature. For the vehicle it is somewhat inclined, that is why I would not sleep here"
105200,2993807,3,MayOliete,20/07/2023,"great to visit the source of the ebro, but to spend the night, better somewhere else. It is next to a cemetery."
105200,2640234,3,ramonytere,04/04/2023,very uneven parking in information they tell us that it is forbidden to spend the night in the whole town but to see the source of the Ebro river it is perfect because you are 5 minutes away
105200,2467629,4,AJBP,28/10/2022,the squares next to the entrance to the source of the Ebro River are the most level. Highly recommended Fuentebro Restaurant as well as the PR-S 80 route that starts from the parking lot itself.
105200,2438800,4,mercelz,12/10/2022,"Quiet place but very inclined. Good internet coverage. The entrance to the car park is better indicated with the road signs than with Google maps, there are two accesses, one good, and another more uncomfortable. Google leads to the worst."
105200,2402629,2,CasitaNL,25/09/2022,Good spot to visit the nacimiento but not for overnight stay. Much to steep.
105200,2323677,4,Aydalae,31/08/2022,"Very quiet, next to the river birth park. I slept alone, the restaurant closed early and no one was left. Some incline and little traffic on the nearby road."
105200,2220769,5,emonzong,12/08/2022,Very quiet area. We were in the middle of August and we spent the night alone. There is an almost flat area near the road below the bus zone. And there is a small cemetery next to it. Quite an adventure!!
105200,2194180,4,marieta36,07/08/2022,"We liked it, although it is close to the road, there is not much traffic, there are restaurants, so there are key hours that are full and the spaces are small, we have parked in the bus stops. At the end of the day, only 3 motorhomes, very quiet. beautiful walk right next to it, easy access and no services"
105200,2064835,4,anthonito4u,12/07/2022,Quiet place but small squares and quite an incline. Good place to visit the source of the Ebro.
105200,1888246,4,Mescal,14/05/2022,"Secluded parking, the road can be heard but it is not a constant traffic, so it is quiet. The inclination is salvageable with shims without problem. Start of the route to the source of the Ebro."
105200,1751844,3,elenagm77,10/02/2022,"area located on the outskirts of town. Right next to a busy road, so the noise is very loud. good services, the clean water tap is true that it is still normal. short walk to the town which is very pretty."
105200,1705765,3,julenperez.zeberio,07/12/2021,"Very nice place although it agrees inclination, quiet"
105200,1647425,5,MinetSuarez,16/10/2021,"Quiet parking perfect for visiting the source of the Ebro. We have spent the night without problem, very little traffic, no noise. The area near the road is less steep, the rest is steeper. Near picnic tables."
105200,1534245,4,Byshiyo,31/08/2021,"It is not an overnight area but at the tourist office they comment that there is no problem with the civil guard. It has picnic tables within the route of the birth. Of course, the cleaning brigade began to blow with the blowers at 8 o'clock and at 9 they went to have breakfast in the picnic areas. They were there until 10.30! Keep in mind that they like to work with the fresh one, hahaha. They won't let you sleep."
105200,1459328,4,Avileslu,15/08/2021,"Uneven ground but it can be solved with shims, apart from the fact that there is less slope below. We spent a quiet night despite being next to the road, just one more motorhome. It is highly recommended to get up early to see the source of the Ebro."
105200,1395706,5,Tusky,02/08/2021,"Very quiet place, without services but with a bar / restaurant next door. Lots of slope that can be saved if you get down to everything. To repeat!"
105200,1289207,5,vagabundavan,01/07/2021,Easy access. The park has tables in the shade and a pleasant walk.
105200,955988,4,Jotade,12/08/2020,"Quiet place, we spent the night with another camper"
105200,843298,2,Eternoviajero,30/06/2020,"Much fall, we ended up looking for another site."
105200,494572,2,gepetto66,27/05/2019,"We stayed here last night, very sloping, as the restaurant was closed we parked in front of the car park, the advantage of traveling out of season."
105200,482845,4,CASTELLANO,12/05/2019,"Parking of the Birth of the Ebro river, very quiet for the night. Uneven parking, without services for filling and emptying. Cafeteria and information point in the same parking. Very bright."
105202,3265343,4,SerendipitousNomads,06/09/2023,Big parking field above the chapel. Levelled space for several vans at the top with nice views over the valley and quiet. A short walk through the abandoned old thermal buildings to the new one. Affordable spa and sauna which is nice on rainy days. We went just for the Sauna and Hammam for €8 per person including towel and gown. Spa baths only a little extra but head cap mandatory.
105202,1304222,5,mamatisara,07/07/2021,"The spa has super cheap prices ... 1 hour € 4.50. the setting is spectacular ... ruined templar spa. Free spa parking, and there's another entrance across the river down the road"
105202,1044547,3,F.Miranda,13/09/2020,"Good place to park, big park all sizes, it has an old ruines of Roman thermal area, has a modern hotel next to it. It has a lot of bike trails and walking routes from this spot. We went to the Thermal Spa and a massage to. Good experience. Good two nights! Very very quiet at night. You will have no problem in parking or sleep in this parking!"
105208,3205496,3,ogolux,23/08/2023,Idyllic place! Be sure to follow the directions - otherwise you risk getting stuck in the sand (navigation via GM). The sink is very spartan and only has a cold water connection. You should cook at a common place - this is where you can get stuck. The concept is more of eating together in the small bar.
105208,3151815,5,cezzieontheroad,15/08/2023,Very idyllic scene with a lovely pool and friendly people
105208,3137564,3,aleeas,13/08/2023,"Nice location, pool and nice view. Sanitation is good. Depends on a bit of a community atmosphere, everything on trust. The owner is friendly on arrival but turns out to be a wolf in sheep's clothing. There is a good revenue model, for example, selling Lidl ice cream per piece for € 1.80. Dogs and cats roam around and sniff at and in your things. Cooking is not allowed on a gas burner only in a special place."
105208,3122545,5,LEBRETONJK,11/08/2023,"A small corner ideal for an almost total disconnection... (there's still wifi!) On the other hand, a reconnection to nature and simplicity, a host at the top and a concept based on mutual trust, which is becoming rare In France ! Thank you Julien for your welcome. We recommend and we will come back!"
105208,3104767,5,flym,09/08/2023,"Julien, the owner, has taken advantage of the site to develop a very pleasant campsite mixing chic and bohemian. Well-appointed pitches and well-equipped sanitary facilities. We enjoyed the meal taken at the same table as other vacationers. Nice atmosphere"
105208,3082661,5,SamanthaLeGall,05/08/2023,"We loved our stay there. The atmosphere is great, the place magical and Julien is super nice."
105208,3074361,3,Stinkwurz,04/08/2023,"Very lovingly designed campsite. Geared more towards tents than RVs. The driveway is exciting, but was super feasible for our 6m Womo. We (my friend + my dog on a leash) were ""attacked"" by 3 dogs and barked at us, which led to a point deduction for me. Scared us ultra and the dogs are part of the site. Disposal was indicated, but none existed, only 4km further in town (which is not easy to do with this access road). That leads to the second deduction. But the owners are super friendly, there is a small bar and a small pool, and the sanitary facilities are very clean and well maintained. We stayed one night and felt comfortable and safe."
105208,3054148,5,deffromontfamily,31/07/2023,"Access ok by van, by camping because I don't know. Atypical campsite in the good sense of the term, friendly welcome in French, €28.30 for two adults 3 children a van and electricity, nice swimming pool and sanitary facilities ok :-)"
105208,2953646,5,ToMaTe87,12/07/2023,"Very cool, relaxed place. You get to meet nice people and can sign up for dinner together in the evening. Good cafe at the bar, nice little pool. There is also an outdoor kitchen where you can prepare your own food and wash up. Thanks Julien (+Stuff), we had a lovely time."
105208,2929773,2,jasperajansen,06/07/2023,"Nice campsite, but hard to reach with big camper vans. Camper spots are all the way up the hill and a small steep path leads to the toilet building. Nice pool with honesty bar. No Bbq (coal and gas) allowed. Simple dinner available for about 15 euro pp. we went here because of all the good reviews, but in my opinion its a bit overpriced and not worth the hassle of going up the small gravel roads."
105208,2904404,5,Boehnlein,29/06/2023,"A highlight! The atmosphere is familiar and the joint dinner at a large table was outstanding. But beware! According to Google Maps, many roads lead to Uxa. We really had a hard time climbing the pitch with GM. By far the best way is from the Church of Panela: Nossa Senhora da Conceição follow the blue signs. Otherwise you risk getting stuck."
105208,2851062,5,HazelTucker,13/06/2023,"Fantastic campsite in nature! We loved it. Clean modern hot showers and wc
Honesty page in bar for drinks/ice cream etc
Julien is very friendly and super chilled. We only stayed one night but will be back."
105208,2828473,5,rossi141067,07/06/2023,"We stayed 4 nights. Fantastically beautiful. Approach the last 2km difficult, but doable. Our 85hp motorhome at the age of 25 also made it."
105208,2760021,4,Richter5,18/05/2023,"A nice place with everything you need. There are nice little things like swings and a slackline. The pool is really nice and was a highlight. The driveway was manageable for us, but it is not without it. We are 8.80m long and 3.50m high. On the way, many branches scratched our motorhome. From our point of view, the last curve on the site is not feasible without rear-wheel drive."
105208,2729170,5,Laikayatra,06/05/2023,"A true paradise! Beautifully situated on the green hills, next to the vineyards, with a view of Penela, a lovely swimming pool and above all a very nice atmosphere! We got to the spot easily with rear wheel drive and if you don't have that, Julien will help you get there!"
105208,2715334,5,VirgileSANCHEZ,02/05/2023,"A novice motorhome owner, I was apprehensive about the dirt path... The route turned out to be largely accessible! (Clear signage). Intimate place, surrounded by nature, calm and rejuvenating. pool and animals. Spacious, very clean sanitary facilities. Breakfast provided, friendly dinner. Thanks to Julien and his team! Discovery of a superb region!"
105208,2699653,5,Veke75,26/04/2023,"Lovely campsite in the middle of nature, beautiful view and you can take beautiful walks along the GR26 route. Stayed 3 nights, so blissfully quiet in nature. Recommended!! It is best to send an app to the owner and he will direct you to it. Took the difficult route via waze and is through narrow streets."
105208,2643880,1,kooorange,06/04/2023,"We tried to cross the last climb, in vain. Frankly with a motorhome, it's not possible, I can't even imagine if the road is wet. It's a lack of respect, you don't pay for the repairs due to your unsuitable access road!!!"
105208,2626562,5,eliasModlmair,27/03/2023,everything was great
105208,2607265,5,Evmunster,12/03/2023,"We were a bit hesitant about the arrival due to other reports here, but it was fine with our 6.7 meter camper! Pleasantly surprised by nature on arrival. Despite being unlucky weather wise, we enjoyed this place and spotted a fire salamander. Many different hiking options and fantastic views!"
105208,2602150,5,2dryverfamily,07/03/2023,"Passing through in August 2022. Good breakfast, a top-notch setting, beautiful pool and super cool atmosphere, thank you Julien!"
105208,2575872,5,pierrepp,12/02/2023,"camping in a wood, water and electricity on my plot, small bar/snack and swimming pool in season, nice French owner, nice collection of Rapido and Notin caravans, final access a little difficult but nothing risks nothing... I highly recommend for lovers of peace and nature"
105208,2557725,5,walkmetothewoods,22/01/2023,"A very attentive host, always there to answer our questions, very quiet and friendly place."
105208,2544936,5,Candra,07/01/2023,"Super nice host, secluded, quiet, dog-friendly, water & electricity right on site. The journey is well signposted from the village. The places are distributed on the property and everyone has a little spot for themselves. We would definitely come back when we are in the region. Host also speaks French + English"
105208,2525967,5,thechapcamper,21/12/2022,Absolute paradise. Enjoy the peace and the view. Come with the right expectations. Please contact the helpful and congenial owner Julien about the best access route. From the church in Penela and very clearly follow the signs. With a 6 m camper stood in a beautiful place. Nice walking route to village with castle. Water from own source.
105208,2405462,1,yvesbach,26/09/2022,"place very badly indicated, totally inaccessible with a motorhome of 3.5t and 7m to banish .... stone path, very very steep climb. No U-turn possible, in short I struggled to get out of this trap... cursed destination..."
105208,2319223,5,JazzMo,29/08/2022,"Nice place, great nature to go for a walk. Great shower! Spacious, clean and hot. The bar overlooks the valley and pool. There is a great selection of drinks and breakfast if you want it. Washing clothes is also great! 4% surcharge for credit card payment!"
105208,2282165,5,ed83uzas,21/08/2022,"Perfect place to relax after a long day in Coimbra! Or just passing through to the south! Easy to get to, very nice host and if you arrive earlier than 8 p.m., you can have dinner for €12.50 pp. Rich breakfast also possible until 10:30 a.m. Approximately 10 places available. Very sure! Also very good with family"
105208,2264219,5,karineetfred,18/08/2022,"Super campsite run by a Frenchman, very family-friendly and friendly place. possibility of breakfast and evening catering."
105208,2254801,5,ndhaas,17/08/2022,"Wonderful place, super relaxed atmosphere, great views, very friendly and helpful owner. Definitely worth the detour!"
105208,2225436,5,capazos,12/08/2022,"The place is great, the pool is incredible, if you are around here it is well worth it. It has drinking water very close to the squares and a buffet breakfast option for €5 for adults. For €14 a night it's wonderful."
105208,2197030,5,jufa35,08/08/2022,"Natural place at the top! We loved the atmosphere, the places, the friendliness and the welcome. Very clean sanitary. The children also really liked the space of freedom, the swimming pool with the view!! And the animals. Autonomous and trustworthy management where everyone creates their stay and enjoys the places as they please. We recommend it ++++! The last kilometer unpaved but it passes even with a motorhome of 7.5m"
105208,2170074,5,el51,03/08/2022,"Amazing beautiful place! We stayed here for one night as we were passing through, but we would have liked to have stayed longer. The owner is very friendly and helpful. There is a swimming pool for cooling off with beautiful views. Everything looks neat, tidy and clean, such as the toilet building, but actually the entire campsite is neat."
105208,2127603,5,noeltuote,26/07/2022,"Super cool place to lay by the pool and rest before hitting the roads again. Very nice welcome, bar and snack bar to eat if you want to hang out! In the top!"
105208,2076008,5,paul7338,15/07/2022,"Reception: 6/5!! Environment: 5/5 Calm: 5/5 View: 5/5 swimming pool, toilet, bar everything is perfect! note the welcome and confidence of the owner. we are really free and without any constraint. an atypical site, ideas for construction initiatives, location for super Vans. Many thanks to Julien and his team. Paul Claudine and Louise."
105208,1985457,5,happyfamilysurlesroutes,17/06/2022,We were very well received by Julien the owner of the place. The site is very well maintained. A swimming pool with a magnificent view and the possibility of having a drink at the bar. Clean toilets. Magnificent atypical accommodation... did we fall in love?
105208,1966661,3,SuuzBlom,11/06/2022,"Great vibe and lovely people, cool pool and great view from the bar. However: this is a place in the mountains with a difficult access road. The spots on the campsite are also quite tricky to get in and out, and you need leveling gear for sure. This is, contrary to the entry here, not a farmstay, it’s a purpose-build campsite with a couple of goats and the neighbors have a vineyard. The camper spots are quite far from the toilets, you need to go along some steep and small stairs in the dirt. Especially at night or in the evening, this is quite the hike and only partially lid. We left early because of all this, but it’s also a very tranquil place that other people might like a lot."
105208,1912237,5,niklaslemaire,24/05/2022,"We had a wonderful time here. Small eco campsite with a special flair in the mountains. Cool atmosphere, the owners are very friendly and helpful. Sanitary facilities are very clean, warm water is available. We will definitely come again :-)"
105208,1911834,4,Carlssonmitdach,24/05/2022,"Lovingly designed, small and quiet place. Approach via forest / service road. We paid 12€ for 2 adults in the van. Outdoor kitchen with induction plates is a plus. Sanitary still quite new (container), cleanliness ok - the reception/counter can be found in the common area by the pool. There are cold and hot drinks and a breakfast buffet. Pool didn't seem heated."
105208,1776661,5,LaHijaKoala,07/03/2022,A good place to get to know the Xisto Villages. The host Julien very helpful and pleasant. Clean bathrooms and facilities.
105208,1771005,5,mirthevans,02/03/2022,"Had a lovely quiet night. The road to the campsite is unpaved and at times narrow, but with our motorhome (6m long) it went fine. Campsite with separate places for the camper in the back. Good facilities, hot shower and clean toilets. Swimming pool and bar in summer, closed in low season. Perfect for resting."
105208,1752738,5,sophlkartoffel,11/02/2022,"Little paradise in the middle of nature, really nice staff and owner. Great place to wind down and relax. The facilities are clean, there's a kitchen and a chill out area where you can sit down and talk to the staff and/or other campers. Thanks for a great time, we'll be back!"
105208,1752083,5,mariellereniers,10/02/2022,"Beautiful place, we are here for another week with our children (4-9-14)"
105208,1732379,5,snoopykaihi,11/01/2022,"waw what a place, easy access for vans up to 7m.
super chill green and comfortable parking area.
The owner is the best!

if you look for a place to chill this is the place. Thank you, we come again for sure"
105208,1681778,4,janitravels,07/11/2021,Really a nice place. With goats and chickens and a pool that should actually be heated a bit by solar. Unfortunately that wasn't the case and it wasn't that clean either. And since we were there in November the sun disappeared quickly. But in summer it is definitely super nice !!
105208,1654452,5,smilo,20/10/2021,"A really magical piece of earth. Great people great place. With a large motorhome, the way there is adventurous, but doable. The reward awaits at the destination."
105208,1622403,5,DebbyCtH,02/10/2021,A lovely place to recharge. Surrounded by nature and within walking distance of the village of Penela. The road to it was semi unpaved and a small adventure in itself. A bit steep from time to time too. This is not a standard place for all campers but more a place for bus campers with people who have a love for minimalism and nature
105208,1554587,5,Pamplemoussedu53,06/09/2021,"Everything you would expect from a campsite, and much better !! Magical place surrounded by nature and under the freshness of eucalyptus trees. Julien is a chic guy who created this unique land of welcome. A great experience to absolutely recommend!"
105208,1500020,5,OliverBrueck,23/08/2021,"Great place, were there 2 nights, no problem with our CamperVan (5.50m). But it shouldn't be much bigger. Very friendly handling, great tips from Julian. Highly recommended for nature lovers."
105208,1458079,5,GabiBergwerff,14/08/2021,"After a stretch of unpaved road, we were warmly welcomed by the staff of this small atmospheric campsite in a top location. On arrival we received a detailed explanation about the facilities. The bar is self service. In the morning a simple but good breakfast is possible for €4 per person. The sanitary facilities are good and clean, but not in large numbers. Normally a mixed group, due to COVID, many Portuguese families are currently. The cozy atmosphere is enhanced by the chickens and goats :)"
105208,1414190,5,ilanoxman,06/08/2021,Wonderful campsite with a good view and good vibes. Family atmosphere and very friendly host
105208,1324578,5,MartKlifman,14/07/2021,"Beautiful place to stay. The views are stunning, the pool is really nice and the staff is really friendly. Bathroom are clean and with good showers. 

Do not recommend with a big camper due to steep entrance, but for a campervan up to 6m. it should work."
105208,1317508,5,lauramac,12/07/2021,Beutiful campsite. lovely owner. the views are stunning. highly recommend.
105208,1316919,5,alexetkentin,12/07/2021,"Seeing the place, we immediately decided to stay longer. The location is of this campsite is absolutely fantastic. We are surrounded by nature! The sanitary facilities are super clean. The swimming pool allows you to enjoy a spectacular view. It is a place where you can rest even with children! In short, I want to go back :-)"
105208,1273671,4,PinaColadaLiebe,24/06/2021,The navigation system led us over adventurous gravel roads to this idyllic spot with a refreshing infinity pool in the middle of the green; Julien is very nice & helpful; terraced terrain with camping facilities on a fairly level lawn; no gray water emptying possible; in the evening you can enjoy fireflies; Falling asleep with the chirping of crickets; € 12.00 / night without electricity
105208,1265999,5,Wotschi,20/06/2021,Thanks for the wonderful Stay. It is a little paradise with some nice people around!
105208,1224963,5,schurlithevan,29/05/2021,Such a great place! You feel like you are in nowhere and in the middle of nature. Very nice and friendly. Shouldn't be left out ☺️
105208,1218341,5,maxmstrmann,25/05/2021,Beautiful and very well-kept area! Julien is very friendly. We stood here with two vans and absolutely enjoyed nature. :) The absolute highlight is the infinity pool with a view of the forest! Any time.
105208,1060619,5,Clouless,20/09/2020,Lovely place with a unique style of 60/70s campervans as chalets. Host Julien has set up his uxa paraiso and cares for his goats :) Easy to chat with other guests in the common area and take a rest with beautiful views. We took a hike to the village of Penele (45 min) and enjoyed local culture (beer at 70 cents). Only difficulty are some muddy dirt trails due to heavy rain.
105208,994488,5,jtdavid,23/08/2020,"I'm not much of a campsite, but this one is well worth it. The owner is very friendly and helpful and the place is truly a paradise, clean and with all conditions. The pool is heated and, although small, is enough. The kids loved giving figs to the goats! The only drawback is not having a proper place to dump the waters and having to do it with buckets."
105208,953570,5,markuslhm,12/08/2020,"The description is on point. Very lovely familial place, extremely relaxing. Breakfast for 4,50€ with bread, cereals as well as fruits and juice."
105208,949206,4,hymer4family,11/08/2020,"Very cozy park, excellent views and with all services.  Sympathy reigns in all employees.  Park distributed by terraces which can make maneuvering in larger motorhomes difficult.  ideal park for campervans.  The final part of the path that takes us to the park is on dirt, with a final climb that may be impossible for weaker motorhomes or with little traction."
105208,944768,4,vreydap,09/08/2020,"Quiet and relaxing place, but al, limited go for something beyond a Camper. If you go with a motorhome, call before. The best access from the fire station, but even so, there are places on the road that in the rain, I doubt that without 4x4 traction a motorhome will lift it."
105208,930196,5,GregAurel,04/08/2020,"Amazing place. Great welcome from Julien and his team. Swimming pool and top view. Clean sanitary facilities. 1 van, 2 adults and 1 child € 16. Really very honest about the spot"
105208,918886,5,lauraexplores,01/08/2020,"We stayed for two nights and would have stayed longer if we weren't limited in time. Wonderful and relaxing place, a pool with a great view and very clean facilities. The kitchen has everything you need (even a fridge) and we did a trip to Fragas de sao simao and did a little hike around there / went into the water which was only 30 minutes by car, as well as a little hike around the campsite itself. There was also a huge motorhome that managed it's way over the bumpy street."
105208,897097,5,Kaplou,25/07/2020,Great campsite on the farm for those who love nature and tranquility. The sanitary facilities are new. The infinity pool overlooking the hill is very nice. Julien is very friendly and available. we recommend
105208,875867,5,hobberia,17/07/2020,"Amazing place immersed in nature with beautiful views, yet only a 30min walk to the historic village of Penela. Lovely pool, super friendly staff, great showers, and a kitchen with everything you’d need for cooking. We stayed in our caravan and paid 14/ night with electricity. We stayed wayyy longer than we planned originally because it was so peaceful, completely surpassed our expectations. We will definitely be back and recommend it to everyone!"
105208,875863,5,Supercamp86,17/07/2020,"Incredible place to disconnect from the world, one of my favorites. We stayed four nights but would have stayed longer if it weren't for the fact that we have to keep traveling. A bit difficult the last 200m especially if you are taking a caravan like us. Luckily Julien came to our rescue."
105208,837325,5,Pdesmond,26/06/2020,"Can’t recommend enough. Julien the owner has set up a great glamping site which also has space for campervans. €12 for two people and a campervan with all facilities included. As mentioned, new showers and toilets with good hot water. Very beautiful site with a bar, restaurant and pool. You won’t regret coming here!"
105208,827942,5,HAKUTrip,18/06/2020,"Magical place, very clean and peacefull.
The feeling of a 5 star resort at the price of a normal campground:)
Best way to arrive is from the firebrigade ( Bombeiros) in Penela."
105208,798862,5,emimarchan,15/04/2020,Super campsite We made a great cabin. We took advantage of the swimming pool. Magnificent walks to do in the surroundings. Julien is super nice.
105208,786178,4,family04,25/02/2020,"02/21/2020. Ideal place, very beautiful and well appointed. Know before coming: no emptying of gray water, black water in the WC. Too bad I couldn't stay more. Only downside: access. You have to go to Penela and from the fire station it is signposted. A steep ramp towards the end but it passes (CC 7m). Other accesses proposed by maps but very perilous, I do not recommend."
105208,783507,5,LucaFiechter,20/02/2020,"Nice, quiet place in the countryside. For little money there is everything you need. Definitely particularly nice in summer, with pool and bar. We'll be back!"
105208,738496,5,jamcosta,04/11/2019,"The place is excellent, very peaceful, surrounded by nature. To get there you need to travel a few hundred meters in a dirt road but it's worth it."
105208,698529,5,SMAT,20/09/2019,Beautiful atypical place. Nature and modernity at a time. Simple and discreet welcome. GR 26 next to a superb walk to the village and its Castelo. We recommend it.
105208,667860,5,Pamyouyou,30/08/2019,"Great place in nature. All the comfort is there to rest in road trip: very clean showers and toilets, calm and resting places, infinity swimming pool in a fantastic frame, bar. 1 van 2 adults: 16 € / night + very good breakfasts (4,80 €).

We arrived with our van without booking and Julien found us a location with a superb view of the mountain. Very nice infinity pool with a bar where confidence is required (we use and note!). Price for 1 van 2 adults and 2 children 18 € / night ... derisory ... We loved it !!!"

Beautiful to relax and recharge your batteries. There is also a bar with a pool and clean sanitary facilities. Goats and chickens are also available. Prices for a motorhome including electricity 14 € / night delicious breakfast for 4 € / person Access for motorhomes is best from the fire station in Penela, simply enter uxa Paraiso on Google and then the access is also possible for vehicles over 3m. It is advisable to inquire in advance by telephone, as parking spaces are limited."
105208,460746,5,k.maluck,20/04/2019,"Wonderful. There is a pool, goats and chickens and a very nice owner. Access via MELHORADO is more suitable for RVs. Wonderful view. Shade."

105215,1008681,3,Fangelisee,28/08/2020,"Large parking lot near a sports center. Groups of young people came to make noise all night long. Regular passage of cars and passers-by which makes it difficult to find a toilet area, especially if you are in a converted truck."

105234,645664,5,LeaveItCleaner,20/08/2019,"Absolutely stunning spot, keep it clean! However, do not drive further than the gravel track. First reason - every vehicle that goes down roughens up the farmers field a bit more. Second reason -  while we were there we saw three vehicles get stuck and then we also got stuck and had to have the help of five people pushing and a tow to get out - (that was with the slightest bit of rain from the night before, god knows what it would’ve been like if it had actually rained a lot) Happy travels, always leave it cleaner than you found it!"

There was no social control at all and there were some shady figures walking around. A really desolate area. We have chosen to be in a parking garage in the city for 2 euros per hour (max 2.30 high) and to spend the night outside the city for about 20 minutes."

105245,1162785,2,TeamCarlo,01/04/2021,"Nice try... the person which has designed the service area and defined the rules probably never travelled with a campervan herself. It seems that the design was more important than the function in the designing process. -the water and toilet water is installed with less than a meter distance so people use the portable water for the toilet. WCwater is less good accessible -the parking area is not levelled out but still, you  are not allowed to use your levelling legs -you are not allowed to open the windows that protude outside the perimeter of your Campervan and at the same time there is no shadow -not good for service nor for break nor for sleeping, which is a pitty because the town tried to provide an area for campers but at the end...well... you can do full service in the area if there is no other one nearby. Still thank you for trying Argamasilla de Alba- your town itself  is very pretty and the women in the tourist office very friendly:-)  ;-)"

105245,1121089,4,somobiker,13/12/2020,"I have not spent the night there, but a very good place to do water changes. They have replaced the plain tap with a threaded one. Many thanks to the city council of argamasilla."
105245,1039323,2,lossintecho,10/09/2020,There is hardly any shade. It's okay to empty tanks
105245,899826,2,Mersuso,26/07/2020,Impossible to sleep all night on Saturday because of the music from a disco next door. To change waters is perfect.
105245,762680,2,leiremclouis,02/01/2020,"I did not really like the truth, the tap of the fountain to recharge water is smooth, with which you can not put couplings. It is close to town, that's good, not bad to visit."
105245,669797,3,masanjiro,31/08/2019,"Very good area, although on Friday it is full of cars right next door with loud music. I imagine that during the week it will be different."

105245,596634,1,MoFu,03/08/2019,Very suspicious area. I drove on.
105245,566228,1,Usagre79,21/07/2019,This area is a joke because it has a very good conditioning. The bad thing yesterday Saturday I swallowed a concert of the Junco and a whole repertoire of disco music of 20 years ago There are two discos that go to all pads and do not give truce neither by the music nor by the traffic of chick with cars music bottle ... etc The funniest part of the rules of the motorhome zone of not making noise
105245,563753,2,chelipondrio,20/07/2019,We have had a very bad night. Summer disco right next door with full-fledged music until 6:00. I do not advise it in summer.
105245,523997,1,MCarmentb,22/06/2019,Through the entrance it looked very nice and there are streetlights and sports area. But next door they are dedicated to make a bottle of kids with music to everything that the speakers of the cars give them (which they put in step to skid from time to time) and make it unbearable. We wanted to stop to sleep but we left terrified.
105245,521842,1,rooroo,20/06/2019,"It was really noisy, not many spaces at all,  seems to be a hang out place for kids at night as we got woken up by load music blasting from cars and kids being loud. The police was there watching and didn't do anything. We moved locations at 1 in the morning to a parking spot down the road which was a lot better."
105245,505844,4,ventures,06/06/2019,"Very good step, we will come back."
105245,501394,4,mjtjiago,02/06/2019,"Good Area next to sports areas (basketball and track athletics) and municipal swimming pool, with urban children's bicycle track. You need to call Ofic. Inf. Tourist or Local Police to register. Essential visit to the cell of Cervantes, where he was inspired for Don Quixote (that's why the town is called ""The place of the Stain ..."")."
105245,498705,4,algarvedave,31/05/2019,Arrived late afternoon today and discovered that as there is a running race scheduled for tomorrow we would need to leave around 6am. We enquired in the tourist information office and they suggest we went to Embalse de Penarroya approx 12kms away. Which is where we stayed and we are glad we did. However whilst we didn’t stay is location looks ok and is in a quiet part of town. Grey water and toilet cassette emptying are possible. We would have been happy to stay if not for the running race.

105245,457641,3,beni340,17/04/2019,"Correct area, easy to park online, although spaces not delimited. It is a roller that you are forced to go through the Tourist Office to register. We have called because we did not arrive on time, they close at 7:00 pm, in that case they have told us that we can go through the Municipal Guard, located next to the Town Hall."
105245,432826,5,Cesareo,24/02/2019,Quiet and spacious place.
105245,420339,5,cabony,05/01/2019,"Hello, area to visit the town and sleep, you have to request permission from the tourist office and you can stay up to four nights. Area with all services. To empty blacks you have to uncover a metal sheet that not all use it although it is very well marked, there was paper rest in the one next to where the water is filled. A spurt of ears to these gentlemen who for not lifting the trapdoor look for the most comfortable. Appreciation to the town hall."
105245,406684,4,emjauk,11/11/2018,Called in today to use services. An odd set up as could see no drain for grey waste if underslung tank. No problem for us as can carry to drain. Black waste available but no separate tap for rinsing cassette. Do watch out on gravel areas for dog poo. The town itself is very nice. Some great play areas for kids. Plenty of commerce.

105257,1810276,4,PeterPuch,08/04/2022,"We were the only ones here overnight. Very quiet road, partly because only local residents drive by and there were not that many. Due to the rain and strong wind we had a fascinating view over a roaring ocean with gigantic waves. There are waste containers, the taps and showers were working, the toilets were still closed. The correct address is 28 Rua Punta Alta, Arteixo."

105257,957031,4,GureKabiya,13/08/2020,"I don't give it a 5 because the ground is not level almost anywhere. We have slept alone, good views and tranquility. There is a beach shower, spotless toilets, trash and fountain. Right next to it is a house. Nobody has criticized us. The site is worth it."

Room for 3-5 camper vans max.
Benches and tables in the shade."

105266,437630,5,Occitania.Fr,08/03/2019,"If you park indoors and without a view of the house, the dog will be quieter than if you stay on the roadside or in front of the toilet. Otherwise beautiful place."
105266,424875,3,Sarahmorris,26/01/2019,Fine for a picnic stop but not for sleeping as dogs barking constantly in the house opposite
105273,1147896,4,AyAOurense,07/03/2021,Illuminated parking with some inclination. The monastery is definitely worth a visit. Spectacular. Quiet night only disturbed occasionally by some barking and by the bells that the inhabitants of the monastery decide to ring when they see fit .... (5.50am .... 7.20am ....)

They give you a coin that once you put it in the slot, the lid opens and another green button for water. Easy comfortable and simple. In the store they also sell the product for the toilet."

We had dinner in the restaurant, well priced, they are open 24h and the kitchen until 11.30pm, at least now. We asked if there would be a problem sleeping in their parking lot and no, light and security. Some noise."

We have only stopped to empty and fill, we have had to pay the token (€ 3) at the restaurant cashier. When we were going to start, one of the owners came to help us because he said that sometimes it failed, he stayed with us to see that everything was going correctly."

105292,2591361,5,marano05,26/02/2023,very good. 3€ toilets not far but despite that toilet paper everywhere it's not motorhomes but all the converted cars that also come to park the sad

105292,2501331,5,Alinawrrmn19,20/11/2022,"Access with a T6 was uncomplicated and, in my opinion, also possible for larger vehicles - only the first corner is a bit sharp. I was one night and all alone, so nice and quiet. The house where there may be toilets was closed and the fresh water is not working. Great starting point for a spontaneous hike to the adjacent mountains."
105292,2490916,4,hannaey92,11/11/2022,"More suitable for vans and vans or brave mobile home drivers. Water still doesn't work. Toilet emptying is still possible. I drove up a few meters further, where you can also park, a bit sloping but very nice."

A sign indicates that it is paying but we did not find a parking meter. Starting point for lovely walks. Be careful, the services do not work and to access it, take the path of the industrial estate rather than entering the city, the streets are very narrow"

It seems to be an active fishing area, as we went to bed watching one group and got up with another. The access is a bit complicated and well, we camped in the corner of the wall and it smelled very strong of urine, we must take it into account, otherwise it was great"
105333,2647659,2,lwacrenier,07/04/2023,Place with a beautiful view of the ocean and the waves! Too bad that several groups of young people came to interrupt the soothing sound of the waves with their music… I didn't stay for the night! Pretty dirty place...
105333,2591806,4,escoudriver,26/02/2023,"Very nice spot for its view of the ocean and the rocks! Unfortunately little space on flat ground, and rather poorly maintained place, a lot of waste here and there despite the presence of a small trash can! We spent one night there without problems, we were alone, the sound of the nearby waves covers the potential noise of the road which is just a little higher!"
105333,2440562,4,jim797567,13/10/2022,Great spot by with outstanding morning views!
105333,2369249,4,veve1992,13/09/2022,"Wonderful place! The only flaw: the access ramp to the car park has very deep holes to pay attention to, fortunately it is only a couple of meters long."
105333,2251065,2,OlguiAlonso,16/08/2022,The place is a bit dilapidated. There was rubble and it is very poorly maintained. The views are beautiful but the environment does not accompany. We don't stay.
105333,1856942,1,jitsensebas,28/04/2022,Lots of cars coming and going with a lot of noise (music and laughter/talk). Not recommended if you want to sleep.
105333,1820012,2,tanjamaxtours,13/04/2022,"We were really looking forward to this stop because of the good comments! Unfortunately, we got stuck with the camper on the flat spot in the sand. With four local fishermen it took almost two hours until we were free again. We were accompanied by pounding basses from the cars of some young people. Road is also quite close, otherwise quite nice view! Better park upstairs!"
105333,1811522,4,henrizka,09/04/2022,"Located on a street but not disturbing at night. Nice view, but some fishermen at night, also not disturbing, very good for one night!"
105333,1796544,3,Alex717,26/03/2022,"Only one flat spot, rather filthy, pretty busy with local fishermen, we did not stay but moved somewhere else for the night. (No sign that it’s forbidden to stay, I guess it’s okay)"
105333,1781971,5,Nobodysun,13/03/2022,"Great view, sometimes a bit uneven but not too disturbing. The adjacent street isn't very busy, and afterwards I didn't even notice it."
105333,1768291,3,finnyb,27/02/2022,Nice view and only van there 27 feb but super loud people shouting for several hours pretty stressful
105333,1756589,4,RWD_40,15/02/2022,"We spent 2 nights and 1 very pleasant day there. The place is not very clean, the road just behind, but by parking facing the ocean you can't see anything and hear nothing but the sound of the waves. Only 1 or 2 places at the top (flat, view...) the rest is not worth it in my opinion. A bit crowded and quite windy when we arrived on Sunday evening but then nothing."
105333,1747142,5,4Vanderlust,04/02/2022,"02/01: Incredible, you have sunset and sunrise from this spot! Very quiet at night"
105333,1742776,5,Benoitarres,28/01/2022,"Few places but great spot, view of the sea with sunrise and sunset, some fishermen passing in the early evening. Very quiet night even with the proximity of the road. 2 relatively flat pitches. In January we were 2 vans."
105333,1692666,5,nathlz,18/11/2021,Great for a wonderful night view
105333,1655946,2,Paquett,21/10/2021,"Nice spot close to the coastal road. nice view and right next to the cliffs. during the night several people visited the place to hang out, listen to music or relax. at some point some people were trying out bengalos and other fireworks so we left."
105333,1647342,5,RobertHenzler,16/10/2021,"Great parking space right on the cliff, space for about 3 vans. To be reached even with a 7m camper, the way to the cliff is not long. Trash can available, very quiet."
105333,1619255,3,ladridolibre,30/09/2021,"Good views, nice sunset and nice sunrise. But it is very dirty, there is rubbish and rune everywhere. It is sad to see the little conscience, the little education and the little respect that there is."
105333,1605404,5,maxVW,24/09/2021,"Fantastically beautiful place right on the cliff. There were a few anglers at night, but they were very quiet. The entrance is not that easy to see and very bumpy. However, no problem with the VW bus. We would love to come back!"
105333,1499915,3,TojaLehmann,22/08/2021,"Actually a very nice place, but it was Saturday night and young people came that night and played very loud electro music for 2 hours. That seriously disturbed sleep and there were many anglers who were often at the car and left at night. But under other circumstances, you could certainly have given 5 stars."
105333,1494761,5,coalco,22/08/2021,"Wonderful parking, with great views. The inclination is saved with leggings."
105333,1465386,5,emsrio,16/08/2021,Very nice spot close to the city. A bit dirty as people before us left some garbage. Few fishers and locals who come by for drinks on the rocks but otherwise pretty quiet.
105333,1287076,5,leafrommtp,30/06/2021,"Just perfect ! Magnificent view, super quiet, sheltered from the wind and fairly clean. No service but a trash can. Superb evening and superb night."
105333,422859,3,Tioutby,16/01/2019,"One of the last quiet spots before the cities. The way to get in is a bit smashed but with a truck it goes. A corner with a nice view, quiet at night, unfortunately quite dirty. It is also a good fishing spot. Thank you"
105345,3063142,3,familleFLJ,02/08/2023,"Small, pleasant shaded church square for a lunch break, a stone's throw from a large supermarket with petrol, emptying and filling for camper vans. Ideal for refueling with a view of the city's Chateau."
105345,908068,3,hcpina,28/07/2020,"It’s a nice place to park and spend the night, but with very few interesting things in its surroundings. It’s quiet and clean. Does the job well, but it won’t amaze you."
105354,3091729,5,castroamaria,07/08/2023,"We arrived on a friday around 11pm. It was super busy, but we found one free spot. After +/- half an hour, everyone from the restaurants around started leaving and we could park in a bigger spot. There is absolutely no shadow but the place is rather flat. The next day we realized we could drive and park our (very old) motorhome down at the reservoir. We slept super quiet and safe!"
105354,2586757,1,maxxl,22/02/2023,"Impossible to start with a 6 m Womo, higher up is from the square but forbidden according to the Civil Guard, which has a branch office in the center."
105354,2433668,1,nemito76,09/10/2022,IMPOSSIBLE road for AC or vehicles that are not 4x4. Also there is NO shade.
105354,2221893,4,wlouane,12/08/2022,"We spent a very quiet night there, alone with a beautiful view of the lake. There are showers on the lake beach. On the other hand, no network and no shade!"
105354,1825017,5,Joguhrt,15/04/2022,"We stood 20 meters from the lake for 2 very quiet nights. The area is super nice and a supermarket is 10 minutes away by car and there is also a restaurant. Unfortunately, we did not find the said showers."
105354,1809306,5,janinevn,07/04/2022,"Be careful driving downhill!
We spent one night at this camping spot. During the day it rained and we wanted to sleep in the lower ""parking lot"". The road down was slippery and muddy.
The night was quiet and calm. We have not been asked to leave, no one has asked for anything at all. We have not found the shower.
In the end we made it to the top without too much trouble some slipping and sliding."
105354,1627877,5,dtau,05/10/2021,Great place. Lonely and calm. You can go down to the reservoir and have a wonderful swim. Water still warm. Cell phone reception weak.
105354,1582013,2,iola84,15/09/2021,"Be careful, steep and long slope on arrival, to be done only by van. We slept on the promontory which dominates. very calm place to see anxiety given the desert environment. Avoid rainy days at all costs, you will not be able to go up. big stress for our part, We struggled to start from behind without knowing if it was going to lead. To avoid"
105354,1284458,5,Fitzroy,29/06/2021,"We slept on the first hill down the dirt road, located to the right of the Breña restaurant. Breathtaking view although distant from the lake. Very quiet on a Sunday evening and clean. A shepherd passes over the neighboring hills in the early morning. Don't miss Almodovar del Rio Castle."
105354,1189943,4,VanCatTrip,09/05/2021,"The road is a bit difficult, but nice in a clearing overlooking the lake. You can swim and fish in the lake. We spent three peaceful nights."
105354,1139189,3,CarlosDiaz,19/02/2021,3 Stars because the dirt access (in the photo the slope and the potholes are not well appreciated) is not good. I guess everything is daring ... then you come to a very cool and lonely meadow (see another photo). With an AC of 7m and a lot of weight I thought about it and decided not to go down.
105354,1052396,5,MonicaBosch,16/09/2020,"We were camped 24 hours, 5 minutes walk from the reservoir where we kayaked."
105354,803425,5,Fannyche,18/05/2020,"Very nice, quiet place. We had a pleasant night."
105354,733433,5,adventuresofdaisy,29/10/2019,Stayed for the night after visiting Cordoba. Completely alone apart from a shepherd and some sheep in the morning! Access fine for a small van but could be challenging for a large vehicle.
105354,506967,5,malibert,07/06/2019,Very nice and quiet place! There are several flat areas where you can park well.
105354,502091,5,clemensbr,02/06/2019,Beautiful spot. No shade. The parking below is only accessible via a bad steep gravel road which is worse the the one coming down from the road. We stayed on the top. May 15th 2019
105354,465384,5,fritzibusi,23/04/2019,"Beautiful spot. Unfortunately a lot of trash, we did a clean up. Please always clean after yourself and respect the beautiful nature! Be careful when driving down and up, the road is very bumpy!"
105354,458626,5,phoebegg,18/04/2019,We stayed in exactly the car park showed in the pictures. We stayed for 2 nights because it was so peaceful. Lovely walks around the reservoir and interesting bird life. Lots of flies because it was so hot but we managed! Not really suitable to swim.
105354,435965,1,brammers,03/03/2019,Very steep access with a lot of loose rubble so we couldn't chance it. Leads to spacious areas with lake views. Access to the water is 5-10 mins walk and there is the usual rubbish left behind.
105356,2745168,5,frank1974,13/05/2023,perfect for a quiet night of sleep. be careful when accessing the parking area especially if you have a long motorhome
105356,2607885,5,Carlo_Bettina,13/03/2023,"we arrived in the afternoon and then slept the night. No problem quiet. I point out that there are 4 open bathrooms with water, we have downloaded the cassette but there is no tap to rinse you have to use your own. There is a fountain near the Padel pitch."
105356,2447194,2,fletch_uk,16/10/2022,Inaccessible for us in our 7.5mtr due to our vans long rear overhang and the certainty of bottoming out on the steep entry & exit. We had to move on. The parking looked fine from above in a quiet village with local amenities & nice views for a more suitable vehicle than ours.
105356,1639911,2,angelgil,11/10/2021,Ample and too quiet / empty parking. loose dog and several people hanging around who did not inspire confidence in us. It was on a business day. We leave.

105513,1884574,3,boobookitty,12/05/2022,If you come here closer to high season it is quite busy with cars and vans of local workers so I'd advise to only come in full off season ! lovely view though
105513,989662,4,Milbasura,21/08/2020,"We have slept there other years out of season. Access is supposed to be for authorized vehicles only. With GV without problem but you have to be careful that it is a bit steep and with tight curves. Very nice views. Being at the top, the sea breeze is constant."
105513,590599,5,mamafedona,01/08/2019,"Quite place for a night, not vehicles authorised to stay. Great view and beautiful beach not so far (just a long scale from the parking). Very close there is a toll parking, restaurants and a pharmacy."
105513,411395,4,lyd.jas,02/12/2018,"This place is just great! We stayed here for 2 nights in the beginning of November. Very quiet, great views, good opportunity to swim in the sea and jump of the rock in the middle of the bay, wonderful sunset.
 Important note: this place is not suitable for big campers, since you can only get there by a steap dirt road. Also not legal to stay here in high season!"

105537,391715,5,josecpaulaf,11/10/2018,"Private area of the restaurant ""km 6.5"". The owner allows restaurant customers to rest with the motorhome in the huge parking area, which is huge and with convenient access. Children's area, perfect for a break with children and / or eating with family in an excellent restaurant"
105558,2775520,2,Knaus-650-MF,22/05/2023,"The place does not make a good impression. Apparently parking is not allowed on the concrete slab. Traffic sign ""No entry"" and ""Restricted stopping ban"" We drove on."
105558,2691783,3,harmony7,23/04/2023,"Free parking which felt quite safe on a dusty, flat area next to a supermarket. Ten minutes walk to the seafront. No facilities but a decent spot."
105558,2680472,5,Guyonaarts,19/04/2023,"We have now slept here for 2 nights with our 2 children (camper 7.5 meters long). During the day it is busy and cozy here. Play field next to the parking lot where many children play. No nuisance. Quiet at night, only some traffic noise. 10 minutes to the beach and the nice town. Definitely recommended, you can stand on the concrete slab next to the playing field. Close to police station."
105558,2631562,4,JML11,31/03/2023,"only parking, free, clay, quiet for the (good) night we spent. Barely 10 minutes on foot from the magnificent town center and the very beautiful beach. super in step, see more."
105558,2574231,3,fastlanefreedom,11/02/2023,Spent a night here & felt safe enough to leave van for a day in Sitges. Not much level ground to park but should accommodate 10 vans . Supermarket next door & 10 minute walk to the seafront.
105558,2165743,3,javi51,03/08/2022,"dirty place, abandoned and close to road with traffic noise. the night has been quiet, enough to make a stopover, for nothing more."
105558,2075029,4,cocobg,15/07/2022,"We spent the night without any problem, it's not very beautiful and the road passes by, but everything is relatively calm and out of sight! Frankly we recommend without problem for a night of passage."
105558,1869287,3,Toja22,04/05/2022,"We spent half a day here. It is just a park with no services,just bins. There is a big Carrefour market next. We saw girls skating and ladies walking dogs in the basketball ground next to the park.
Sitges is 10 minutes walk and this parking is ideal to visit the city."
105558,1768920,3,Ralphdomi,28/02/2022,"Noisy but very convenient parking. Adjoining the Carrefour supermarket which is open every day even on Sundays. Installed 3 nights in safety, for the extraordinary carnival of Sitges, on the concrete platform. Ideal for visiting the city center on foot (15 mins), dirty but it didn't bother us. No water except on the CC areas of the city but they are not recommended."

105558,1593522,4,LPK,20/09/2021,"Parking right next to supermarket and police, near the beach and the town. I recommend entering on the left side, right next to the basketball court. We spent the night with two more motorhomes, very quiet night."
105558,1494797,3,shelcore,22/08/2021,Parking near a supermarket and near the police. It is not the best in the world but you can sleep relatively well. There is no shade and it is close to the beach
105558,1353956,2,vanere,23/07/2021,"We have slept one night without problem, it does not have any service. Next to a supermarket. It is not the best in the world but to spend one night is fine."
105558,1158957,4,ivanito,27/03/2021,"Quiet during the week and very busy on weekends. No services, except the supermarket that is next door. We sleep without problem with the motorhome, you can't ask for more, it's free."

105558,488897,4,GaraziMayordomo,20/05/2019,"Highly recommended Right next to the Carrefour (which has bathrooms in the covered parking). Cerquísima downtown, 15 minutes walking. We recommend the entrance to the parking lot on one side of the football and basketball court, without having to go down the steep slope of sand and stone that you see at first. We have stayed with several AC, very comfortable, without noise."
105558,440737,2,Oihan,17/03/2019,"It's not the best place in the world to spend the night (no service, rubbish around), but it's not a problem and it's quiet. Some train and traffic are heard. spend a night well"

105561,1391121,2,raulgg306,01/08/2021,We couldn't get there. Google Maps has taken us through a neighborhood of ultra-narrow streets and there has been a time when we could no longer go by height or width (Mercedes Sprinter monocoque) and we had to go backwards. With AC it would have been impossible to go that far.

quiet place, good for fishing at night."

105565,621430,3,adambubba92,12/08/2019,This is actually for access to Mohle Leste beach which is north of Supertubos. Fine to stay but it is extremely busy during the day and fishermen use this beach and pass through the night.
105565,590292,4,snigel,01/08/2019,"Thanks for the tip. Appreciated the drainage for the showers, nice to use shampoo without harming the environment, and the showers are hidden away so not many people use them. We actually slept here as well, but a lot of coming and going of cars long after sunset and the wind also woke us up in the middle of the night. But ok for one night. Sleeping three stars, showers five. :)"

105567,1753972,1,Vkal,12/02/2022,"The paved parking lot is a BUS parking lot! The meadow in front of it is obviously used for celebrations: campfire sites, empty alcohol bottles... We are not squeamish, but this place did not seem suitable for an overnight stay."

105570,2510105,2,Kutter2,01/12/2022,crapped toilets. Garbage is limited. Garbage cans are obviously always too far. Beer cans scattered everywhere. Barking mutts all around. We didn't stay.
105570,2477113,3,Encarh,01/11/2022,"We have spent a night with a car and his housing trailer. It is wide and quite dirty. Although it was the night before a holiday, he was calm. Quite a few cars pass by on the road, but we weren't next to it and they didn't bother. We didn't see any toilets or garbage cans."

105575,1640120,5,andrespartal,12/10/2021,"Spending the night before the bridge of the Pilar, in principle it gives a bit of shit because you are literally alone and on top of that I arrived at 10:30 at night and at night you could see nothing. They have made the streets and sidewalks but without building, there are no streetlights, no one has passed all night, perfect and safe for a couple of nights, fleeing the bustle of the city."

105576,896161,2,Didiruca06,25/07/2020,"Positive of this parking is that it is central, although for thick AC it is difficult to park, to spend the night we would not be much movement and noise from the road."
105576,734492,2,lesepicurieux.eu,31/10/2019,"This large, welcoming car park is nevertheless quite noisy day and night: the road and the traffic light are very close. Step which depanne (close to estartit where everything forbids)."
105576,621147,5,Catalega,12/08/2019,"Old farm completely renovated and very well prepared. The perfect deal. It is noted that the owner is also a motorhome. Upon arrival, at the door is the phone number to notify and in less than five minutes it is at the door serving you. Very, highly recommended. The price is worth it."
