99659,2088648,4,ETNA-44,18/07/2022,"peaceful place in the middle of a small village, with fountain, picnic table and playground. people are very welcoming only downside: mosquitoes are strong from 9 p.m. !!!! take care of the place it is the premises that maintain"
99659,1786253,4,BobterHaar,17/03/2022,Stayed here for 1 night on the way North. Arrived at around 21:00. There were some parking spaces left. A small dog in front of a house got alerted and circled the van barking for over an hour. So maybe its best to arrive a bit earlier to not keep people awake. Good for a single night but feels invasive to stay any longer.
99659,1427953,5,CW38,09/08/2021,"We recommend. Warm welcome in a hamlet with colorful houses. Water, shaded picnic tables, trash can, calm. Be careful as soon as the sun sets, hordes of mosquitoes attack: remember to close your van or CC!"

99659,1120439,3,suhlmann,10/12/2020,Just normal parking in the middle of a tiny village far from anything to see. It was a quite night for us. Only the train in the morning. Playground was closed due to Covid-19.

99659,855715,5,JoseAngelGarcia,08/07/2020,Tiny car park with tables and a fountain to fill water in a beautiful town with very few houses. We have eaten there and without any problem. Neighbors in town very nice!

99665,1300658,4,thisme,06/07/2021,"Nice place to park just a bit sloping - but shouldn't be a problem with wedges to put under. We drove 100 meters further into a smaller gravel bay on the side of the road there only have space for 2 small campers, but it is there now. No problems with security or GNR"
99665,1039945,4,ToSchi77,10/09/2020,Great park lot for one night wit amazing view in the morning after an astonishing sunset at the cliff. Only problem was the traffic of some party people during the night and the lights of neighborhood. But really worth for a night!

99665,660262,5,nicnac311,26/08/2019,"Perfect pitch with a view of the picturesque coast in both directions! Stand there over the night without any problems! Further down is the paved parking lot to the beach. But it is everywhere at an angle ... The way to the beach is a very long staircase! Unfortunately a lot of garbage, especially toilet paper ...: /"

99734,2980732,4,Albaniact,18/07/2023,This is the Monegros service area. It has services open 24 hours a day. We spent the night in front of the cafeteria. Nobody has bothered us at all and noise has not been a problem despite having the skylights slightly open.

99734,2484413,5,Ingritta15,06/11/2022,Quiet place to spend the night. We stopped in the middle of the route and it was great. We got up early and continued. There is a gas station and a bar...but we don't need either.

99734,508902,5,Bitan,09/06/2019,"We have slept very quiet with 2 more vans, no noise, station bar next door somewhat expensive but with services."
99772,2175714,1,oldud,04/08/2022,Sand access. 4x4 essential
99804,3263231,3,Carlos.Cajo,06/09/2023,"Specific and free parking for motorhomes, but it is right next to the main road, which means a lot of noise all night. There is no access to water or a place to flush dirty water."
99804,3217363,3,Route22,25/08/2023,Thanks to Lidl. I slept one night. Had no other alternative. It's noisy at night because of the main road. But homeless people are still not respectful on site. We drank beer together. But at night the lights are turned off and it's really dark and I stood alone.
99804,3070205,3,alhucemar,03/08/2023,"Many thanks to Lidl for these spaces that are very useful for us, that's why I fill my basket in them, there are no other services but I am grateful."
99804,3069126,3,sueandray,03/08/2023,"Thanks to Lidl for the facility. Shop is large and clean. A couple of homeless nearby but polite and respectful so no issue, and we were only van there. However, main road is very busy until about 2am and very noisy - particularly motorbikes - so would recommend only to stay overnight if no alternative. Parking at nearby Continent is the same - next to road."
99804,2556822,1,cc76,21/01/2023,I spent 1 night. really too loud for me
99804,2521393,2,runningfix,14/12/2022,had planned to stay overnight but didnt feel safe with the homeless vagrants at the lidl entrance so moved onto the Faro municiple swimming pool parking lot and had a peaceful night.
99804,2460941,1,Metvijfopreis,24/10/2022,the place gives a very unsafe feeling because of the bums and weirdos who keep circling your car all evening and night and throwing things at your vehicle because you don't give them money.
99804,2422469,2,HenSyl,04/10/2022,there are indeed parking spaces but water and drainage do not work.

99804,2026436,5,LidiaM,01/07/2022,"There is noise but at least you can park quietly without being assaulted by the police at one in the morning. In the lighthouse, the local police told us that it was forbidden to park in any lighthouse, only for a few hours, if they saw an AC for a long time, they caught their attention."
99804,1981239,5,Steffi.und.Tobi,16/06/2022,We had a fairly quiet night here despite the main road and car wash next door. There is free WiFi here and Lidl has very clean toilets.
99804,1777832,5,bigcamp,08/03/2022,"Four motorhome spaces in the Lidl car park, which is noisy due to its proximity to the main road. In the nearby car wash, loading and unloading for € 3 during opening hours."
99804,1666892,2,suasuasombra,28/10/2021,"Such a car park is appreciated. But it is next to the main road and many cars pass ... in the center there are more places. The good thing for geeks like me, is that there is a swimming pool nearby and the entrance costs € 2.10"
99804,1321690,3,24,13/07/2021,"Thanks to LIDL, big places. Beside, washing station, possibility of draining water, cassette toilet. Add clean water. Busy road so noisy! Finally for a night and / or a stopover is good."
99804,1104805,5,LucasE,25/10/2020,It is a tranquility to be able to park the AC in a place authorized for it. There are not so many opportunities in the Algarve. It gives the opportunity to visit Olhão and to shop at the supermarket .. Obrigado Lidl
99804,879430,3,MHekman,19/07/2020,Next to a noisy road. Lidl ads are not  very clear if you can spend the night there. There was just me there so I took off.

99804,467560,4,malcon,25/04/2019,"It is the parking of the lidl that has enabled 4 seats for motorhomes, we have spent the night, I do not put 5 stars for the noise that there is traffic all night since it is 20 meters from the main road, on the other side of the parking there is also a supermarket continent and between the two supermarkets a car wash in which you can empty and fill waters for 3 euros, very attentive staff."
99804,452014,4,whisky58,10/04/2019,"Nickel for emptying and water for 3 euros, thank you"
99804,424352,4,Herewegoagain,24/01/2019,"Perfect place to stay for the night, with €2 you can empty black and grey next door and refill your water and if your ambitious like us wash your motorhome too. 4 large motorhome bays and made very welcome."
99804,397614,3,MichelMichel,23/10/2018,"There are 4 places for motorhomes at the bottom of the car park, very good for commissions, no more. And next to the Lidl, there is a laundry for cars and motorhomes and in addition we can make the services of clean and gray water plus toilets for 3 euros."
99805,2608485,2,Chcol89,13/03/2023,"Shopping but we can't stay there at night, everything is forbidden we flee this region"
99805,1969666,4,naiaramiquel,12/06/2022,"Quiet place until 6 or so, which is when they come to unload. It's not lit and it was just us so it was a bit scary. But all good."
99805,1353030,3,alis68,22/07/2021,"Please note, the employees have confirmed to us that if ever the GNR were to pass, we risked a fine. So we didn't stay."
99805,1132438,3,sf809,23/01/2021,Staff leaves around 9pm and comes back before 6am. No one cared. You hear the main road and some trucks passing trough the night.
99805,795964,3,Maetthy,16/03/2020,"If I asked the Lidl staff, I was allowed to stay overnight in the parking lot. That was ok."
99805,724135,3,chausson51,18/10/2019,We tried to sleep there. rather quiet. nobody came to disturb us. it's a good backup solution
99805,683929,1,MathildeCpde,09/09/2019,"The police have passed, it is forbidden to sleep in the parking because it is a private parking."
99805,633296,3,rohe,16/08/2019,Nice place to stay over night. It was very calm. The toilets are clean. 5 places for caravans.
99805,452383,3,Barcobird,11/04/2019,"Trying to park overnight In Odemira legally is not possible, so after our visit during the day we spent a very peaceful night at Lidl. The shop closed at 9pm and then all went quiet. The road outside became quite lively around 7am. However we felt safe and secure and purchased fresh bread in the morning as well."

99806,446293,3,les9roues,29/03/2019,"Just parking because very noisy for the night. Motorhome area 5-7 km away super quiet and for € 14/24 h. Cabrera de mar, area camping Barcelona beach"
99848,2561920,3,CFam,27/01/2023,Couldn’t find the water. Didn’t stay. Was at night so can’t evaluate the environment. It’s next to a road though. Confirm 15€ for caravans.
99848,1693113,5,MiguelHito,19/11/2021,"Ideal area for the environment ... beautiful path with the lake and animals. We only spent the day but I think you could sleep without a problem. In high season they charge € 15 parking per day, I do not know if overnight stays. (without services) but there is a restaurant."
99848,1154251,2,ElenaKot,20/03/2021,No service but to park a caravan it will cost you 2 euros and now it is not possible to park right in front of the picnic area. It has another place without a view and it is quite dirty.
99848,778182,4,Bobstones,09/02/2020,We stayed the night and it was fine. Arrived late and left early so not much to say really. Lots of fishermen arrived early but we were already up.
99848,550995,3,annavanlife,13/07/2019,"Unfortunately, we did not come to the parking lot which immediately a man broke and wanted money. what a shame."
99848,447230,3,Surgo2015,31/03/2019,"Night with visits, at 2 o'clock in the morning the police has come and gone, at 3 o'clock the civil guard (we had an intermittent on), very nice by the way, no problem to sleep. (They patrol the area all night long, so quite calm.) At 6 o'clock the fishermen start arriving, with their cars, rods, shrieks ... Although the road is next to this little traveled."
99868,1174156,5,deviajeconlagordi,15/04/2021,We spent the night alone. The road is very quiet and is right at the beginning of a very beautiful route. Without services and without lighting. Louder in the morning because the parking lot filled up right away. Fairly level.
99868,1033568,4,Lafamiliacrece,07/09/2020,"We spent the night of Friday, September 4. Alone, fairly level and very quiet. Road without traffic. Saturday was quickly filled with people coming to spend the day or go hiking."
99897,1180186,4,Bobby,26/04/2021,"This is the parking lot of a hermitage, very quiet, high up, no view because of the trees, there is in fact a flat location only for one or two small vehicles, the access is very narrow and in poor condition on a small part .... for van only. there is nothing around but it is still a good option to spend the night in the forest."
99897,576404,1,Famililife,26/07/2019,This is the entrance of the Hermitage of Manacor and it is difficult to access with large vehicles. There are better places in the town to spend the night.
99930,3108342,3,guimaraes1971,09/08/2023,"We only stopped to visit, I didn't see any bans on AC"
99930,2958956,4,cesarantorrena,13/07/2023,We spent a quiet but very windy night. No problem. It is worth approaching and going down to Ursa beach if you are moderately agile
99930,2792820,3,Reiziger14,27/05/2023,"You can spend the night here, the tourist office confirmed. GNR drove past and said nothing. No privacy at all. Not for large motorhomes. Watch out for the scammer in the parking lot. The parking is FREE! Don't pay the man. The police are aware of him. There is a bus to Sintra for €2.60. In the end I didn't spend the night there. 9 minutes south is a quiet nature spot, much nicer."
99930,2770749,5,VWBreizh35,21/05/2023,"Great spot, we arrived around 8 p.m. Magnificent sunset. Around 11 p.m. a little noise then nothing. Watch out for Sunday morning around 10 a.m. There is a motorcycle rally. Tap accessible within 3 minutes by car."
99930,2687686,4,foflette,22/04/2023,We slept behind the tourist office. Sheltered from the wind. Toilets closed otherwise paying the day. A little passing
99930,2674365,3,Lagorce07,16/04/2023,Nice place beautiful view but complicated with the wind for the van's sunroof
99930,2595750,5,LandiLuna,02/03/2023,A great place to stay if you are self sufficient. Overnight stays are allowed but beware of the rogue car park attendant. He is nothing to do with Tourist Office. Do not give him any money. If he approaches you and asks for money please let them know in the Office.
99930,2576190,4,Adri9228,13/02/2023,Good for going to the tip no more no less
99930,2556061,5,Boop118008,20/01/2023,Calm night sheltered from the lighthouse (otherwise it is windy)
99930,2551810,3,finniundjuliontour,14/01/2023,"We wanted to stay overnight on a Saturday but it was very busy in the afternoon. Several coaches come and pass close to the long parking lots (on the third picture). Since we suspected that it is not better on Sundays, we parked a little further south on the coast. You don't have a direct sea view from here either."
99930,2548926,4,zucche,11/01/2023,"We stopped exactly where the AC in the second photo is. It was there that the people from the tourist office recommended us. He did not advise stopping at the other spaces because they are small, nor at the roundabout, which is private. Close to trails! It's so worth it."
99930,2525990,3,emax88,21/12/2022,"ok to visit Cabo da Roca in low season, but not very convenient for long vehicles that have to park occupying more stalls."
99930,2392153,5,Seila1985,21/09/2022,"We have spent the night without any problem, from here there are also several routes to various beaches in the area."
99930,2375910,5,JackJJ27,16/09/2022,The place is very impressive. We stayed one night and had a great time. Highly recommended if you want to see a fantastic sunset or sunrise.
99930,2355213,2,sterchi,09/09/2022,"Stupid that bus seats have to be filled. When several buses arrive at once, they have problems parking their buses. Stop beforehand if possible."
99930,2313996,3,furgolola,28/08/2022,quiet night with more AC and campers. quite windy. Wc in the tourist office. slight incline floor. nice views.
99930,2289051,5,mariadelrociogg,23/08/2022,"We spent one night and it was great, it was very windy but if you park right next to the wall it doesn't get as windy. very quiet night"
99930,2268586,4,donillo,19/08/2022,"Nice parking lot, but really windy. The parking lot behind the lighthouse is a bit more sheltered from the wind. No problems with the overnight stay."
99930,2161893,3,Nejt,02/08/2022,"A very nice spot, but nothing for an overnight stay with a car roof tent. It is very windy in the evening and we were worried that the tent would not be able to withstand it."
99930,2023055,3,JeAlexOtto,30/06/2022,Stayed here because in the morning we would visit Cabo de Roca ... Directly on the road ... nice noisy ...
99930,1978938,5,BubsTrio,15/06/2022,"Perfect for an overnight stay at the beautiful viewpoint. We found a spot for our camper van (2.80 wide, 7m long) in the roadside parking lots. From there you also have a view of the sea and you can walk to the viewpoint in 2 minutes."
99930,1964189,1,MSchilke,10/06/2022,"We wouldn't stand there another night. Very noisy and scary at night. Vehicles drive back and forth constantly, honking their horns and yelling loudly."
99930,1856420,5,lou0ntour,27/04/2022,"Great for the night, very quiet but lots of mosquitoes. The seats are very large and there was even more space."
99930,1832738,5,TDausend,17/04/2022,"Absolutely worth seeing location. There is enough space for a large mobile home with a trailer. Overnight stay is not a problem, very calm except for the gusts of wind and allowed, as there are no prohibition signs. It is best to arrive in the morning before the day tourists or in the late afternoon when they have gone."
99930,1807669,4,Juntosporelmundo,05/04/2022,"A wonderful place, the bad thing is that it is always very windy"
99930,1791067,5,CINZIAontheROAD,22/03/2022,"To sleep in Cabo during this period is the only solution allowed. Parking on flat asphalt just below the lighthouse, just before the bus stop. With € 0.50 you can use the toilets of the tourist office if open. Baskets present and restaurants within minutes and very good!"

99930,1763869,2,gfokke87,23/02/2022,Parked here for the day during a hike. When we came back the 2 cars next to us had their windows smashed. Seems like this happens more often in this location.
99930,1762617,5,Ismaelec01,22/02/2022,"Very beautiful place, a lot of wind  but you can say you slept in the southernmost point of the European continent."
99930,1667772,2,Unicore,29/10/2021,"We spent a windy night here with three other campers. In the mornings the police patrolled; we hiked to the beautiful Praia do Ursa - when we returned around 3 p.m., the car next to us had smashed a window. On closer inspection, we found broken fragments all over the parking lot. Our opinion: if avoidable, don't park here."
99930,1622113,3,riverjay,02/10/2021,Okay for one night. Lovely sunset and plenty of space. Starting from 9am tourists and cars are flooding the place and it gets quite loud and restless.
99930,1617554,4,ladridolibre,29/09/2021,"Maximum wind! Nice views, flat terrain, and with several vans when we arrive at night. But it seemed that at any moment we were literally going to fly away! We do not believe that it was that particular night, but it is normal that it blows hard there."
99930,1551008,4,egressax,05/09/2021,"Clean, no problem with higher vehicles. We stayed for the night. No problems at all. Toilets near by (50 cents). Not the best view but does its job."

99930,1311185,5,independentravelers,10/07/2021,"Easy access, super quiet, best sunset ever and there are some places where the wind doesn’t hit too hard. We stayed 1 night and loved the spot."

Indeed, after departure from the GNR and all the cars, a lot of space, slightly sheltered from the wind. Work at the lighthouse until 8 p.m. Very little traffic."

99930,678225,3,Samipa,05/09/2019,This place is only quiet from dark and only until 8 o'clock in the morning. From then it is a tourist stronghold. Tourists are crowded in and then carted away? .. But we slept quietly.

The panoramic ocean is beautiful.
99930,412631,2,elena888,07/12/2018,The place is very very touristic with a lot of buses arriving every minute . We just stayed 20 min for quick look of Cabo de Roca and left ahead to Cascais.

99936,763828,4,MaxGemperle,04/01/2020,"None of this bad judgment is correct. A real camper has the pliers and all possible keys for taps with them. There are two houses on Platzz with extremely friendly residents. If you shy away from people of other cultures when traveling, you shouldn't camp! It used to be a very nicely arranged picnic area. But everything is spotless."
99936,638570,2,carolejose,18/08/2019,"Water not available without pliers and again, see, picnic table in a ""virgin forest"", narrow road far from parking everything in front of houses, not great !!"

99953,3143279,5,Neeleworld,14/08/2023,"It's not just a parking lot, it's a kind of campsite. Because there are camper pitches, a tent area and a community house with toilets and showers. A villager told us to just put some money in the mailbox at City Hall. Nice place, great view and lots of rest."
99953,3111763,5,Ephixt,10/08/2023,"We spent 2 quiet nights. Access is limited for vehicles that are too long or too low Our well-laden Berlingo just passed. The place is exotic, a magnificent view, incredible calm, lots of shade and a slight wind because it is on a plateau. The place is well kept. Shower wc kitchen area available are clean."
99953,3110497,5,lorenamariia,09/08/2023,"Amazing spot in the middle of nature with beautiful views from the campingspots. Alex is an amazing host and even has cold and tasty beers waiting for you. Toilets , showers and the kitchen are great, you even have access to a fridge with a freezer! We enjoyed our atay that much, that we had to stay another night."
99953,3106993,5,evelyn82,09/08/2023,"Exceptional location. Very large locations, all with shadows. They do not let you use outdoor kitchens but there are 2 perfect community kitchens. Clean bathrooms and a beautiful children's area with recycled material."
99953,3060876,5,pierrouf,02/08/2023,"The place is splendid, the pitches are very large and very quiet. Alex is very kind and welcoming and you can find everything you need on site, local and organic products. A shared kitchen with fridge and hotplates is available. Top!!"
99953,2984861,5,FraToGib,18/07/2023,"Perfect place for people who love nature and living in nature. We have been there for 2 nights and Alex & family gave us a warm welcome. The place is very silent, you can see all the stars at night and Listen to nature life. Facilities are very basic, but thus this place is a real nature  experience. It is also a good starting point for bicycle trips to Figueres and the seaside. Nice shop also."
99953,2887679,5,gielbey,24/06/2023,"The site is magnificent, peaceful, it feels good. moreover the services are very well fitted out, with originality. Alex is very welcoming. We discussed his activity and his projects. Unfortunately we couldn't stay for the San Joan fiesta. We recommend this place of rest allowing to visit beautiful Catalan villages and the Dali museum."
99953,2882417,5,vulkainge,22/06/2023,"great spot, huge very pretty. we liked the games, common places, beers, vegetables and fruits on sale."
99953,2880355,3,mnic,22/06/2023,Several cooking places as well as toilet & showers. Water comes from the well and partly smells. The shower is cold - but with a great view. The toilets could have been cleaner (toilet paper bucket was already full & not emptied). Alex is friendly & helpful. Alex doesn't respond to WhatsApp - it's best to call/drive there. In relation to other campsites we found it too expensive.
99953,2830471,5,Ritmodelsol,07/06/2023,"Only to be recommended! The route up here is a bit bumpy, but even a Grand California made it. Guy is very easygoing, sells a variety of organic products from the villages, from wine to chocolate to vegetables. Nice camping kitchens (recommend the upper one by the warm showers)."
99953,2822891,5,barbarad94,05/06/2023,"Beautiful, quiet place! The parking spaces are very generously distributed on the large site. Great ways from the square. Shower with a view of the hills, sanitary basic but works. Very friendly hosts! Be careful with larger motorhomes - with 6.80m we only just and very slowly arrived without touching down! But the way is worth it, perfect relaxation, especially with a dog."
99953,2811668,5,waarheenwaarvoor,02/06/2023,"Wow! What a beautiful campsite! The campsite is located on top of a mountain, with beautiful views all around. There are several terraces where you can park. There are several kitchens where you can cook and use the refrigerator. Several toilet shower buildings on site! Shower with a view of the mountains! What else do you want! In the area there are several hiking trails and a mini supermarket."
99953,2798452,3,hangmanstoy,29/05/2023,"It's okay in itself, in principle everything is there that you need. However, it was extremely windy (no one can do anything about the weather, but there was no wind protection either). Cooking with your own stove is prohibited. To compensate, a communal cooking area for xxx pitches. I imagine ugly before if more should be going on. Overall, the price-performance ratio does not fit here."
99953,2756580,5,sophimatti,17/05/2023,"Great place! Spacious between trees, very relaxed host. Warm showers next to the house, cold showers on the pitch. Simple toilets, sink and cooking area. Play facilities for children, donkeys and chickens. We don't need more, perfect for us! However, no possibility of supply and disposal."
99953,2728118,4,MaSpa,06/05/2023,"Very nice place to relax. Owner speaks English. We were with four other campers on the large area and had a great time. When we were there, the owner took a break until 4:30 p.m. Luckily we were still allowed to look for a place instead of standing in the sun for 3 hours. Warm shower and cooking place available. Unfortunately no restaurant."
99953,2722038,5,HarrysElse,04/05/2023,"A very nice place, larger distances to the neighbors possible. Very nice panorama. Old cork, oak and pine. Several possibilities for cooking and a farm shop are available. Small supermarket a ten minute walk away. We would love to come back here."
99953,2711277,5,VanlifeFever2022,30/04/2023,What a beauty!! On the Iberian peninsula the most beautiful campsite we have come across.
99953,2684892,5,mikaellcmj,21/04/2023,Great spot - nothing more to say about it! Not suitable for mobiles with a long overhang at the back due to the approach. An absolute must is a dinner at Alex's place according to grandma's recipe! :-)
99953,2671382,4,travelwithvicky,15/04/2023,"Beautiful place surrounded by nature. The driveway was no problem for our old Fiat Ducato. However, it has bumps where not so high campers, especially those with a long wheelbase, could land. There is no electricity to connect the camper to the mains. Toilet/shower very basic, no hot water. A communal kitchen is available. BBQ outside not possible due to fire hazard."

99953,2661470,5,Titin1971,11/04/2023,"We stayed for 4 nights over Easter. It's spectacular: nature, tranquility, great services,... The couple who run it are the best, friendly and helpful. It is a self-sufficient farm that promotes the values of respect, sharing, humility,... Without a doubt, it is one of the best places to spend a few days. It has a small shop where you can buy handmade products"
99953,2654572,5,HelgeGehtAb,09/04/2023,"Fantastically beautiful place, in the middle of wonderful nature. Very nice hosts. Nothing is missing. The shower is cold but refreshing :) We really enjoyed the quiet here and would love to come back."
99953,2648163,5,symaeurope2022,07/04/2023,"With our camper, 6.80 meters long, the edge was up and down the slope. There is a wide turn up and down the slope, but we were very close to scraping the bottom. It is a beautiful place, the owners very friendly and in contact with nature and local, but think carefully with a larger camper if you dare ... Shop local and organic."
99953,2647990,5,Nessiii,07/04/2023,"We stayed with Alex for 4 nights. An incredibly beautiful place. Full of tranquility and natural beauty. It is not far to walk to the small sweet village. The sanitary facilities are great and connected to nature. But the last few meters to the property was a challenge for us because of the bumps in the ground. Raised vans and campers don't have any problems. In general, cars over 7m really not recommended."

99953,2581659,5,Barbrady,18/02/2023,"Quiet and peaceful place with ample space. There are sanitary stations distributed over the square, which are quite basic, but absolutely sufficient. Kitchen and showers with hot water are available. The ascent was easily manageable for us - 2.90 meters x 5.90 meters. 10 euros/person. We felt very comfortable there."
99953,2549248,5,maramariapi,11/01/2023,"We had a fantastically quiet night on the farm and bought local products in the farm shop. To the off-road driveway: upon arrival, we landed on the step of our Fiat Ducato. With an empty water tank and maneuvering aid, it was then possible to drive down. We'll be back anyway!"

99953,2189267,5,oelderanne,07/08/2022,"What a beautiful place for those seeking tranquility. Lots of space, few campers, kept very simple and natural. The owner is friendly, explains everything and is attentive. His two dogs are super sweet and run around freely. The driveway has it all. With my Opel Zafira B it was ok at walking speed, but lowered or particularly large bullis will have problems!"
99953,2146274,5,nicocorouv,30/07/2022,Great places! A bit out of nowhere but very well maintained with everything you need to smell good and eat well! Only organic and super good products!

You can tell with how much love everything was built! In principle you can stand freely everywhere and there are small corners in which free showers/toilets are set up. there is also a small 'common room' with a fridge and actually a complete kitchen which you can use! we almost had a bit of a festival feeling in the yard. with a bit of luck you might even be there at a time when a bit of a local party is taking place with people from the area. We'll definitely be back <3"
99953,1961696,5,katharinahattenbach,09/06/2022,"A beautifully landscaped course where you actually come into contact with nature. There is an outdoor shower, lots of old trees, lots of space, cute donkeys and a small farm shop. The driveway is pretty narrow. For the rather high price, however, it would have been nice if the toilets had been a little cleaner."
99953,1956002,5,Moengelperze,07/06/2022,"With our caravan, the driveway to the property was quite challenging, but the place is spacious, quiet and idyllic and the tenants are very friendly"
99953,1939705,5,Shibainu,02/06/2022,"Highly Recommended !!!!! Small snack bar and farm shop (all organic quality), lovingly run by Àlex and Marta themselves. In addition, wonderful hiking trails, open-air shower (with a view of the mountains) and toilet (bio-sewage treatment plant) and open kitchen. We stood 5 days all alone in the middle of pine and cork oak trees in the shade. Ascent with a lightly loaded 6m van just about feasible."
99953,1930108,5,flahaye,29/05/2022,"Great place definitely worth a visit (and a return)! Warm and welcoming owners and an extraordinary place allowing to connect with nature, simplicity, star-gazing night skies..  the road going up there is probably not suitable for any van/camper, although we made it up there safely with a vw crafter L3H2."
99953,1875350,5,muzalan,07/05/2022,"Absolute hammer! Alex and Martha have created a real paradise here. The huge area almost feels like wild camping, but the on-site facilities (toilets, showers, kitchen building, 'shop' with local groceries, etc.) really offer everything you need. The calm and the nature of the hosts is perfect for coming down. The only drawback: when it's windy, it blows quite a bit. :-)"
99953,1845362,5,Transitfamily,22/04/2022,"A really beautiful campsite that can be described as rustic but very amiable. When we were there, we were the only ones in the square. Although the owners were on vacation, the replacement was at least as friendly and helpful. We will definitely come back again, even if the way is quite long. But it's definitely worth it."
99953,1818083,5,PatrickHorst,12/04/2022,"We had a really good time at this camping Site. the owners are very kind and welcomig. the Camp Site itself is just beautiful, and the spots are very spacious so you can have a lot of privacy. showers and Toiletts are clean and with a view. nice community area and WiFi Zone to cook and relax. there is also the opportunity to buy locally produced fruits and veggis. we hope to come back some day!"
99953,1814677,5,BlackbirdsBulli,11/04/2022,"The most beautiful place ever! We are so glad we went here despite the rather plain pictures! The place is on a small hill and the view is amazing! Alex welcomes you with open arms. You can stand where you want. It feels like a small commune! Driveway tricky, but definitely worth it! Clear recommendation for vans! We will definitely be back! Thanks!"
99953,1808327,1,sommer08,06/04/2022,"Under no circumstances is it possible to enter this place with a vehicle over 6 m. The driveway is a steep dirt road, very narrow and there is no turning around. But the worst are the deep ditches in which our mobile home landed 7.40 m each time. It damaged and tore off the electrics from the bike rack and the rear bumper. No recommendation."
99953,1769904,4,noordepagter,01/03/2022,Spacious places. Excellent sanitary facilities. Warmly received by Alex and Marta. A bit pricey for low season (€10 pppn)
99953,1723592,5,jens_felte,02/01/2022,"A wonderful place, very nice owners. There was no warm water because there was no sun, but we survived that. We'll be back for sure. With our 6m Citroen Jumper we had no problems with the road. But drive the driveway very slowly otherwise you will hit the step !!!"
99953,1680457,2,MacLindhe,06/11/2021,"Well, close to the nature it is. The dirt road up there is hard to find, and destroyed the underneath of our car. There was a possibility to charge the phones in a building, otherwise no electricity. Shower with hot water. Possibility to by som vegies, fruit and wine.  Beautiful nature, but that’s all."
99953,1666405,5,Revol-verts,28/10/2021,"Magical place !!! So we stayed there for 2 nights !! My daughters, however, very city-dwellers, loved it, and they were the ones who wanted to come back the night after !! Between the donkeys and the layers of sun, we had a great time with Marta and Alex who contribute with their kindness to make this place a 5 star plus more. Pauline and her daughters"
99953,1644634,5,Daniel_87,14/10/2021,"An absolute dream! The property is beautiful with many possibilities to find a nice place. We stood nicely in the partial shade between the trees. Magnificent panorama, fantastic sunset with a view over the Pyrenees from the hill a few meters away. The hosts are very welcoming. The sanitary facilities are rustic but everything is there and very well maintained. We will definitely be back!"

99953,1611046,5,Enneibaf,26/09/2021,A really nice place to slow down. We got to the property with our VW Crafter L2H2 without any problems. One planned night turned into three. In September there is not much going on and you have a lot of space to yourself.
99953,1594299,5,vivianjay,20/09/2021,An absolute recommendation! We arrived quite late in the evening and Alex welcomed us very nicely. Very nice yard and a great view. We will be back! :-)

Alex and Martha were super nice and you have everything you need. Easy to reach with a VW bus, I also saw larger vehicles there that had no problem driving on the gravel road! A wonderful place!"
99953,1508508,5,cildoc,24/08/2021,Sooooo cozy place with wonderful owners. near llançà and fantastic beaches. sooo highly recommended.
99953,1488618,5,juleemxrln,20/08/2021,"A very nice and quiet place. You can choose the places yourself and are very large and spacious. Our highlight was definitely the outdoor showers with a great view of the mountains. Very nice and friendly reception, we felt very comfortable and extended directly. Price per person is € 12 per night."

The journey with my mobile home length 6.0 mtr. Wide 2.2 mtr. wasn't a problem. Have to drive slowly. We will come back."
99953,1281587,5,Martinneumair,27/06/2021,A quiet place to spend a few days. Alex is very hard-working and friendly. Shower with a view of the greenery and a clean toilet. Ideal as a starting point for MTB tours
99953,1242441,5,Sommersonnenwende,07/06/2021,"We spent two really nice days here! Very uncomplicated, because there wasn't so much going on, we were able to choose the place freely! Had a beautiful view! A day trip to Cadaques is definitely worth it, as is Girona. You can get the bare essentials in the shops in the village, and bread and fresh organic vegetables are also available in their own farm shop! The village can be reached on foot in 10 minutes via a very nice path along vineyards. Alex and Martha are super nice and made us experience a great stay! Thank you very much!"
99953,1180829,5,asm182630,27/04/2021,"Alex and Marta immediately give you the feeling of having arrived. Alex takes care of the farm and the property. Marta has an organic farming project and grows vegetables in the valley of the property. There are two dogs, one of which is totally playful. The toilets and showers are simple but very clean. The showers are warm in the sun. There are three different camping areas with hotplates and toilets with showers installed. The view is breathtaking, in the middle of nature! If you like hiking and mountain biking, this is the place for you. The small village of Rabos has a lot of charm. The approach to the farm is a bit adventurous at first glance! The ramps, which are used to avoid the watercourses on the way, look very steep from below! Can be mastered with a normal van and / or mini van etc without any problems! The vegetables that are grown there can be purchased. The pitches are all surrounded by trees, so there is enough shade available! The cooking areas have their own gas stoves including gas! There are communal refrigerators at every hotplate! The farm is completely self-sufficient! You can draw electricity, but you should pay attention to the consumers! The area is very extensive and when you arrive during the day, you may not find Marta and Alex at first! However, that is not a problem! Stand somewhere! Alex and Marta are very relaxed there! It is also important that the two do it all alone and are constantly expanding! Some places have not yet been fully developed, but a lot is being done, so you shouldn't expect a standard campsite! We'll be back that's for sure!"

Upon arrival your hosts (Marta and Alex) are working hard to have their farm in optimal condition, not to forget Bruc a beautiful super playful German shepherd and his partner Tana a beautiful Leonada mastiff, the two animals super tame with humans and other animals, We have two dogs and they have been respected to the maximum, the toilets and showers, super functional, do not forget that it is a self-sustainable farm, everything works with solar panels, you have to make a responsible use, that is, forgetting to connect your extension, that It is possible, but depending on what it is used for, it will be useless, because it will not work, because its function is to give light, and basic supplies, not forgetting the beautiful enclave with a pasture of southern Alsinas, pines and an olive tree that another. Its donkeys and its pool to bathe in summer, in short we will return and recommend it to friends. Thank you partner, and enjoy your precious daughter."

Thanks Allariz for NOT giving us an optimal alternative. We will not return. PD: we came to this site because in the parking lots near the river and downtown we don't want the town hall, they only give us the option to park on uneven terrain."

100211,3130446,3,frankineta,12/08/2023,"We were a few nights ago, it's acceptable. There is no service, it is a simple parking lot and now there is a house in the meadow in the photos. It is a stop for pilgrims and the only bar is not worth much. They get stressed out quickly and it's expensive. For a night of passage no problem."
100211,2321842,4,CABRY,30/08/2022,"Located in the middle of the mountains, this small car park is perfect for spending the night. It is located right next to a covered square where there is a water point and a cafe where we had breakfast with Pintxo. The horses in the photo have been replaced by a house."

100222,412456,4,Cloben,07/12/2018,"Good quiet spot despite the road a little higher, but few passages. Without trash. On the other hand, the ""view"" overlooks a muddy swamp, it is necessary to continue on foot to have a pretty sight on the pond (inaccessible in vehicle).

100248,1460727,1,luisaestrela,15/08/2021,"Beautiful location next to the river beach and close to Frecha de Mizarela. It doesn't have any services but it's well worth it for the tranquility to sleep, the location itself and the beautiful sunset."

The sunset is spectacular and although the carpark was busy during the day, by the evening it was quiet- we were the only ones. The landscape around is beautiful and on the drive back down to Arouca we saw that we were above the clouds! Highly recommend."

Ultra warm in the city in summer and, like in every parking lot, long hours of work until late in the evening. Then alone in the morning. House of Wonder for breakfast (10:00) and dinner at the top of the roof terrace is a highlight. (15 min walk)"

100250,2029884,5,Claramcdowell,02/07/2022,"parked right beside an amazing public park full of roosters (they are quite loud), ducks, swans and tortoise. The park also has great facilities such as running water, toilets, a shop. Only a short walk from the marine and the town ! Couldn’t recommend more ! (note that it is quite small with not a lot of spaces)"
100250,1953912,5,PatriGS,06/06/2022,Parking near the center. Right in front there is a drinking water fountain. It is close to the area to have a drink but far enough away so that there is no noise. It is true that the roosters are heard continuously.

For information and already mentioned in the comments: depending on the route to get there, you will pass a disposal company (cogersa) on the way there.

100294,2371342,4,camitex,14/09/2022,"agree with all the others, and the smells of nature are ultimately very pleasant. The climb with a 7.5 m. is a bit tricky, but those who want can come by bike."
100294,2181762,4,elenacristi26,05/08/2022,"We only made one stop to eat. Children's games, picnic tables, water fountain. The worst is the smell, but normal because we are surrounded by cows."

Without counting being the only one and asleep from the arrival at midnight of the perfect motorhome who leaves his engine running non-stop to recharge"

Of course, the river next door is not clean at all but the sound of the birds at night was great and the beach with bathrooms and showers"
100318,1535025,4,javyalonso,31/08/2021,"Quiet place to park and spend the night, if it is not a weekend. Subsection: the only thing that occurs to the City Council of Rota to set up a festival next to a motorhome area. Theme aside, beware of mosquitoes that can fly someone away or leave them dry right there. The beach is very close and very nice."
100318,1203548,4,bb.stefkovic,17/05/2021,"Several parking lots nearby, close to the beach. Full on weekends. Possibility to pour gray and black water at the beginning of the city in a small parking lot directly intended for motorhomes. But it's usually pretty busy. The town is relatively quiet, only occasionally planes and helicopters from a military base. You can tune in to their AFN Rota radio."

I did not have Rota on the radar and went checking out Sanlúcar and Chipiona... what a waste of time. Rota however rocks - and this is a good place to start from. There is more parking nearby, but no showers or toilets."

They were very polite and quite understandable with the issue of campers, they made it clear that the island, especially in that area (Santa Eulalia), does not want this type of tourism if not ""more elitist"", but that they would have no problem."

May be able to use the toilets in the Municipal Piscina nextdoor but did not see it until next morning when it was closed. Very pretty village 5 minute walk away. Bar even closer. No apparent restriction on length of stay. Only downside NO SHADE. Would have stayed much longer if we were not on route to elsewhere.

100415,2337259,4,Toni58,04/09/2022,"Very good area, you have to see what some municipalities can do to improve the conditions of those of us who travel, a pity that there are most municipalities that persecute us by prohibiting and fining, curiously they are in municipalities that have camping sites and hotels. Surely because they are in cahoots with them, this in countries with solid democratic bases would be prosecuted for prevarication"
100415,2312964,5,daviniagp,28/08/2022,Highly recommended for its location and the services it offers.

there'a enough space for a lot of vans, it's flat and there are some spots with either shade during the afternoon or morning. 
great free services which are great for everyday chores.
few  cars and locals pass by during the day and the highway close by isn't too bad. 
could maybe use a container, I had to walk to the end of the street to throw away trash, no biggie."
100415,1955053,5,calguy,07/06/2022,nothing to say bad thank you to the municipality for this model installation even free electricity that asks more to recommend

100415,1787149,4,WinfriedBarczaitis,18/03/2022,"The description is correct, but unfortunately all 4 sockets were dead. Maybe the rain caused a short circuit? The town is very interesting and more harmonious in its architecture than the nearby Ciudad Real."

Today, however, it was the opposite, there was no electricity, no water fell from any of the taps, it was 5:00 p.m., with a splendid sunny day, I don't think the pipes were frozen at that time. It's a shame because the area was very nice."
100415,1730805,4,Juanangarcia,09/01/2022,"Area with very spacious and very clean squares, with very good power supply, emptying and filling and working perfectly, to put one downside is that you can hear the cars on the highway a bit, but it does not bother to rest"
100415,1730226,5,AlexyMontse,08/01/2022,Very clean area. The gray water was unclogged and working fine. We did not test the free light plugs. One step away from the town that you can walk. The cars can be heard a little in the distance but they do not take away the dream.
100415,1727773,5,Jejelapache,06/01/2022,"Great area, I go there regularly but be careful I went on 01/05/2022 and there was no electricity. Surely due to the rise in electricity prices in Spain."

A great place to repeat, have tapas and buy supplies for the trip. 4 free electricity plugs, while in other areas there is only one paid and 4 hours only, things well done like this area are very appreciated, Congratulations to the town hall"

Blockage in gray water that does not allow drainage. We drain into a grid on the street, leaving the area on the right, without problem."
100415,1705855,3,currini,07/12/2021,The area is fine but it has a clogged gray drain and the black drain should also be filtered because there was a tremendous puddle of sewage. I hope they fix it soon.

100417,2362923,2,GeoDalmis,11/09/2022,"Right on the river, near a residential area. Definitely quiet at night, if young people wouldn't have thrown loud lightning bolts into the river directly opposite the square from midnight onwards. The snack bars are past their best, everything looks kind of run down. In summer the small beach/river is nice for swimming."

100418,3266987,3,RichardMathey,07/09/2023,billing system is complicated and painful. I had to make 4 round trips to pay. With ACSI you have to pay in cash. for electricity there is a consumption statement. to leave you have to wait for someone to come and read the meter and check if you have not consumed more than 5 kW!! Otherwise €0.65 extra per kW. Complicated . Internet paying separately per person
100418,2997654,1,tipsy35,21/07/2023,"35 euro for two people and a caravan, internet not working, pool closes at noon and lots of flies."

There is a bike lane but we went to town by taxi and walked back even though it is about 3 km from the port. At this time of year the bus only runs twice a day. Beach and a rte nearby."
100418,2749703,3,Haddock4485,14/05/2023,Very clean campsite. Big spaces. Except that it is in front of a very busy 4 lane road and therefore very difficult to cross and go to the beach or to get to the city center. But doable. The environment is unfortunately very ugly. Sea of plastic. Fortunately the city is very pleasant to walk around.
100418,2696797,5,Den_Twan,25/04/2023,"Beautiful and well-kept. is on a busy road but you can choose your place so no problem. sanitary facilities are neat and tidy. receptionist are friendly and english speaking. Places are spacious but around 34/35/33 it's a bit confusing, watch out that you don't get boxed in. Aguilas is 2km away but definitely worth a visit. Plaza de España is a must with nice bars and eateries"
100418,2668273,5,Haka01,13/04/2023,"nice quiet campsite. Everything clean and tidy, friendly service. Small shop including bread service. small pool Pitches of different sizes, up to 8 meters no problem. ACSI 19,-. Cheaper for long-term stays."
100418,2663004,4,TanjaMoehres,11/04/2023,"Friendly welcome. On site only power supply. Only fill up water in front of the campsite, not on the pitch. The sanitary facilities are a bit old, but always hot water, always clean and tidy. In the small reception you can buy the most necessary things at a slightly more expensive price. To recommend. 2 adults, 2 children (14 1) - 4 nights - CKE Card (ADAC) - approx. 130 €."
100418,2657202,5,Schwheinz,10/04/2023,"We stayed here for 5 days to explore the city and area. Were received in a friendly manner and served nicely all the time. Received tips, bread service was also good. Can only recommend the place. Come back when we're around."

100418,2572748,1,RmA_C,09/02/2023,"First the positives: the lady at the reception was very friendly and I was glad to have gotten a place for two nights. At first I was only given a seat outside of the ? offered, then I was offered two ""jobs"" on the pitch. Both unacceptable, I stayed one night. Jaccuzi and pool closed, hot water in the shower unstable, space about 20 square meters. 21€ without electricity, 1 person"
100418,2527919,4,Carl407H,25/12/2022,"the operators are very welcoming and take care of everything. Unfortunately, the site is on the main road, which is noisy in the evenings when you camp in the front area. Unfortunately, sewage can only be done manually with a bucket, not a big drain to drive over with the car. the water tasted very much of chlorine, undrinkable. the place is nice and small, the sanitary facilities are clean and the price is ok."

100418,2444570,4,campenmithund,15/10/2022,"A very nice small campsite with very friendly staff and close to the beach (pebbles). There is also a dog beach 5 minutes from the campsite.

100418,2251055,4,AennaMa,16/08/2022,"We spent one night there with a tent. Had requested and reserved in advance by email, worked without any problems. Pool water is relatively warm and could be cleaner, but it was okay. Pitches have a tarp over them for shade which was great. Lots of green as a demarcation of the pitches. Sanitary facilities were ""okay"" clean"
100418,2215404,3,mamina,11/08/2022,"good welcome and clean but large motorhome avoid sun visors with reinforcements at right angles impossible to pass the places tun little wide to open awning table or chair parking area if the trees were not there. ⁶difficulty getting out 6, 90 m did not tell us the places are 4m wide.

100418,2188157,4,maiholsak,07/08/2022,"A super cozy little place but with plenty of big pitches. Super sweet in the information. Bath and toilet conditions fine. Yes, it may be a little expensive, but worth the money."
100418,2174732,1,laurikax,04/08/2022,"shameful! we suffered an attack in the camping bar, from a person outside of him. The police took him into custody and no one from the staff came to check on us. In short, no security, incompetent staff and very fair facilities. There is no gray water to empty and of course we will never return."
100418,2147921,2,paulamilagro,30/07/2022,Camping a bit expensive for us. The facilities without more. A camper and two people 34 euros a night. There are cheaper places where you can also stay and sleep.

So 2 tokens. very complicated adjustment made on their advice, 3 burnt polars. Gray water drain in a small manhole in the middle of the driveway. a group of Germans (again) loud music until 7 p.m. Result one night at almost 50€."

100418,1564388,2,catdesienne,10/09/2021,"The plots are well demarcated, shaded. The sanitary rules are well respected. On the other hand, what is wrong: The noise of the road. Failure to respect the client's peace of mind. Cut the hedges on the plot adjacent to yours, with loud blows of noisy tools when you eat lunch and it starts again in the evening. For me, to be avoided at this time because the priority is maintenance"
