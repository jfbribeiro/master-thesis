105612,1019912,4,Parte,01/09/2020,"I do not give it 5 for the inclination of the mini parking lot or mini esplanade since otherwise, it fits perfectly with our sleeping tastes: Nature, few people or no one, a lot of tranquility and silence at night. But there are no services or water. The fountains are clearly undrinkable that it will actually be untreated but we do use our water."
105612,873210,5,marevuelto,16/07/2020,"Good place, with picnic tables in the shade, there is parking for cars / motorhomes and there is a fountain !! Thanks to the author of this site !!!!"

105633,1682442,1,HLWashb,08/11/2021,This site is ideal for shade but there are large holes and very uneven ground. There was a lot of toilet paper and litter - secluded so guessing as no facilities it is used as a toilet area. We drove in and decided not to park as dirty.

105633,1275697,4,DavidRubioQuereda,25/06/2021,"Very quiet place, feasible access, some dirt, why apparently they entered the adjacent eco-park and emptied a container. There are small containers. To later access the suspension bridges route, a 1 minute walk away. It does not have any service, other than tranquility, nature and disconnection. Beauty does not present almost any."
105633,1169824,4,xondi,07/04/2021,"A good place to escape, especially if you go all the way inside to the right, where no one can see or hear you. Be careful with the branches. As the suspension bridges route is nearby, a lot of people come to park, especially on weekends and holidays. Super quiet on weekdays or at night."

105640,1164357,1,uxtela,02/04/2021,At Easter (4/2/2021) the road was closed and the campers were left in a lighter crossroads in poor condition. Imagine if it could be spent in other seasons. Must go to another place in town.

105647,2642518,5,quizmaster,05/04/2023,"Fantastic place. Use the remote spaces under the trees for the mirador itself features a “no camping” pictogram on the explanation table…. Secondly, navigation apps make you stop at a wide bend on the tarred road out of las majadas past the los callejones exit. Take the gravel road (camino de la fuente de la zarza) on the right and continue to a place marked “mirador de tio cogote” on hiking apps."

105833,480821,4,seantamsin,10/05/2019,"Beautiful, quiet site by water wheel and weir. Only suitable for smaller vans, our 6m motor home was no problem. Limited spaces. Water supply by tiled wall opposite wheel, but no fittings for hose."
105841,2361248,2,Vicenshg,11/09/2022,"Very cool place, but not at all practical to go with a motorhome. You have to park at a distance and you cannot cook in the motorhome and take it to the park because it is far."
105841,1967944,2,aymericdaudel,11/06/2022,We didn't stay as it is a parking lot on the side of a very busy road. Do the trick for sightseeing but not for sleeping.

105847,2758404,5,anadeparte,17/05/2023,"Magnificent! By way of information: I was just woken up today by those from the environment because they were going to fence off the site so as not to park because orchids grow there. They have only made the place smaller, allowing fewer parking spaces."
105847,2650718,5,protector,08/04/2023,10 out of 5. Wonderful place. Walk through the forest along the stream to the waterfalls. Very quiet at night! There is a trash can. Catching a connection 5g.
105847,2514016,5,JeremyRomero,05/12/2022,"A fabulous and peaceful place. Great to spend the night quietly. Some car on the road near the site, but there is not usually. From 7:30 or so there are more cars, cyclists and hikers, but otherwise great. Only point, what you bring, take it or throw it in the containers that are in the place. Let's respect nature :)))) <3"

105847,406189,5,Dandilucki,10/11/2018,Photos 1 and 2 correspond to very close places. Excursion on foot or by bike.
105847,405960,5,vilamobil64,09/11/2018,"Surprise .... The photos do not correspond at all to the place! By cons the place is very quiet, nothing around, the few houses are not inhabited. We had a good night. Photos 4 and 5 with the full motorhome are taken at the place indicated."
105857,3288048,3,kiraundfelix,12/09/2023,"More like chlorine as an interim solution, quite OK!"
105857,3286822,5,goldand,11/09/2023,"Perfect, even if it takes a good 20 minutes for 100L but it helps out well especially in the evening when everything is closed"
105857,3229673,5,AnnaBel35,28/08/2023,"A small tap, small flow but for free water it's perfect. Be careful, it's not the tap in the middle, the one doesn't work, but the one next to the wall."

Exceptionally clean parking inside the restaurant. WC in the restaurant. It has been confirmed to me that we can sleep. Menu 11 €. Spanish step as we like, simple, lively."
105864,1264239,1,jlpc,19/06/2021,"Not worth it. It really is a widening of the track that goes up to the mountain. Difficult access through the town of narrow streets. Motorhome or try it. The place is sloping and smells of livestock. Many annoying flies. It is not pleasant although the views are nice. I didn't even stay to eat. The same in winter, no odors or flies ... but I don't think so."
105864,413463,1,DanielleGal,10/12/2018,Wenrt there with a 3.2 meters high motorhome. Couldn't pass through any of the village roads. Had to turn away.

105868,2775144,5,Tomas1983,22/05/2023,"Very quiet place, close to the town and the natural pools. To better access the town via the side road. Since the town has very small streets. Very large parking area for motorhome and camper"

105868,2586060,5,Adriatwin84,21/02/2023,"Very nice quiet place to discover the old village. Also very quiet to spend the night. But it is indeed not suitable for wide campers. You can do it with a van, but I advise you not to drive past the Roman bridge."
105868,2513461,5,giselaCutanda,05/12/2022,"Fantastic place outside of town to rest. The parking lot does not close. Although we are going with a van, we have gone along the road that the person who put it there said, and very well, it is easy to find because there is a parking sign. Owls at night. Not suitable for motorhomes, steep turn, very uneven"
105868,2116759,4,AlvaroSanchez,24/07/2022,"Extraordinary parking for Motorhomes and Camper. No water and discharge services. Authorized camping area. Lots of room and plenty of shade. Just 200 meters from the Natural pool and a beach bar that serves lunch and dinner. At 300-400 meters from the town that has a bakery, supermarket and several bars and restaurants. A very nice town with friendly people. 100% recommended"
105868,1894594,4,LMV17,16/05/2022,perfect location to visit this beautiful town! we did not spend the night but we ate in the shade of the trees and we could perfectly have stayed
105868,1805454,1,jose.miquel.cabecas,03/04/2022,Not recommended at all for ACs. Both parking accesses are problematic. The upper access has very low tree branches!!! The lower access goes through very narrow paths !!!
105868,1177896,4,Cristinaha,23/04/2021,"The place is very quiet and beautiful, I was there during the week in April and there was no one else. Some areas with slight inclination. The town has a lot of charm, from it there are a few well-marked routes. It has a fountain, a small shop and bars."

105888,2632985,3,Danivogu,01/04/2023,Very beautifully gardened campsite with friendly owners and a lovely Dutch touch. Unfortunately the road in the vicinity is quite loud also at nights. Dogs have to stay on the leash and are to be guided outside of the site to be dogs. A bit too overregulated in my eyes.
105888,2418964,5,ilse429,02/10/2022,Nice place to stay. Really kind owners. There are places with some shade. The place that we liked to stay was a bit further from electricity point but they could extend our short cable with another cable. Toilet and shower are clean. Don't forget to take a walk to the Mira river.
105888,2408792,5,annascheiwi,28/09/2022,"Nice little campsite with friendly operators. The pitches are big, there are some trees and there is a lot of space. Sanitary facilities are tiptop. The street is audible, but not disturbing for us at night."

105888,1486938,5,lolitagelati,20/08/2021,"Super nice, natural campsite. The sanitary facilities are perfectly maintained, new and very clean. The owners are very, very friendly and accommodating. Because it is close to the street, you can hear it very loud at night. You should definitely take earplugs with you."
105888,1394040,5,campervantrulla,02/08/2021,Everything fine. Simple and nice Camp Site to spend the night. You can arrive till 10 pm.
105888,1286131,4,kuzz6669,30/06/2021,Was there for two times for 1 night and both we was alone in all the camp. Only administration and family who live in the house. Facilities is nice. Clean showers. Kindly Receptionist. You can walk to river Mira but hard to swim - high bank. Nice place for 1-2 nights
105888,1280535,4,crigbee1,27/06/2021,Not very busy when we stayed here which was nice as pitches are quite close. Lovely walk down to the river Mira where you can swim. We enjoyed our stay and may well return.
105888,1266957,5,hughb,20/06/2021,"Possibly the cleanest facilities that I have ever found on a campsite. Enormous shower cubicles, more like individual wet rooms.  The owners were helpful. Plenty of areas to walk the dogs off their leads. For me, my favourite  favourite part was the river very close to the campsite. Excellent for wild swimming and so secluded. I only stayed for the night but I will return for a longer stay."
105888,1266072,5,Melodymaker63,20/06/2021,"What a find! nestled in rolling cork trees and olive groves with the river Mira a 2 minute stroll through the grounds, this quiet little slice of Portuguese heaven is a must for recharging the soul. 7 m campervan no problems with access and level sites. Super kind and friendly hosts Miranda and Menno. Nothing not to like! 6 stars!"
105888,1196429,5,TortoiseTales,14/05/2021,"Lovely natural site with spacious plots. Clean and modern toilets and showers.  Great views and close to river Mira for walks etc.  Owners were great and very helpful. Quiet and peaceful site although I do wish families with children would respect others.    If you haven’t got sat nav there is a sign on the IC1, heading south,  with a caravan and 300m, easy to miss (as we did) as it is not marked with site name.  We will definitely be back. Many thanks"
105888,1185136,5,Ramiranger,04/05/2021,"A wonderful, family campsite in the middle of the country. It is run very lovingly by Miranda and Menno. We arrived late in the evening and were greeted warmly. It's a great place to hike and unwind. A great change from the cities and typical campsites. Everything is very clean and tidy. There are beautiful, large parcels with partly shady trees. The two come from the Netherlands and can also speak German very well. We thank both of them and would be happy to come back."
105888,1137930,5,TinkaTana,16/02/2021,"A really lovely place and dog-friendly. Had we had better weather, we would have stayed much longer. The operators, Miranda and Menno, are super nice and they took great care of us. We will come back in any case. The landscape is great for hiking. Thank you very much for the great time Magdalena and Rüdiger"
105888,1106297,2,Arianedefesquetbriz,26/10/2020,"I have no camping experience, this is our 1st trip and 2nd campsite so I can only compare with the campsite where we stayed 2 days just before “that of barragem de Odivelas” .. on this application they have the same rating while it is not comparable. The only positive point I see are the toilet and bathroom which are clean. C not very child friendly. The próprio do not speak Portuguese. No pretty seen apart from the ugly earth and olive trees. We hear a road right next to it. Basically no luxury."
105888,1047724,4,Dadcat,14/09/2020,"Beautiful campsite in the middle of olive trees and cork oaks, very welcome, very clean and well organized during the COVID period, the only downside is the noise of the road."
105888,911797,3,ozge,30/07/2020,"Very nice camp site as an area, under the olive trees, clean facilities. There is river very close by  if you are up for it but not really refreshing. There is non-stop noise from the highway and we learned while we were leaving, not enough water to fill up the tank. There is room for improvement."
105888,877582,4,Catcha80,18/07/2020,All necessary conditions. We only spent one night but nothing was missing. Very hot zone in summer.
105888,807383,5,simonwilsonjersey,23/05/2020,"We wanted somewhere quiet for a few days before heading to Lisbon on just our 2nd motorhome adventure. I found Camping Serro da Bica in ACSI app around 20k south of Ourique so easy drive from Alvor where we had been for a few days.
So, we arrived 13th March for 4 days but very quickly the covid Pandemic really kicked in and ferries back to Jersey (home) were suspended. The site owners, Menno and Miranda from The Netherlands, had just 14 vans and caravans on site with many with no formal home to go to. They spoke to local authorities and agreed that we could all stay on site as long as we didn't venture out in our vehicles.
The site is just off IC1 in the hills above Rover Mira. There are walks around the river, countryside and cola archeological sites. Nearest village in a couple of kilometres but only 60 people and no shops. Terrific for dogs which is great as we have our 2 with us.
It has been surreal with sometimes a feeling of guilt as we have had such beautiful surroundings and wonderful hosts who could not have done more. They collect shopping lists twice a week and visit supermarket in Ourique for our supplies.
Some of us have been working on site painting, installing new pizza oven and various others little projects that they had or their ""to do"" list.
Friends now for life and eventhough some have now started to move on we will be here for a few more weeks. But, that's not really a hardship.
If you're ever in the area look them up. Very clean facilities, grocery van visit on Thursdays, great dogs walks and swimming, yoga by the river weekly, site drinks (happy hour) at 5 on weekdays and a pizza oven.
Finally, just another word for Menno and Miranda, fabulous people who restore some faith in humanity and could not have done more to make us feel welcome and safe."
105888,775015,5,Mobie15,01/02/2020,Stayed 4 weeks January 2020. If you want peace and tranquility in beautiful surroundings with lovely hosts and first class facilities then this is for you. Lovely walking down to the river and around the hills. Will be back again.
105888,767666,3,wistro,12/01/2020,"Very clean, well maintained. However, due to the nearby Ic1 a restless night. For us, unfortunately, nothing for long. The surrounding nature is very beautiful."

105888,534646,4,mathedidier,01/07/2019,"Great place in a beautiful countryside to recommend. Only, there is a very little shade and in summer with ""classic"" temperatures of more than 35 degrees it poses some problems. The owners questioned do not want to plant trees because 8 months a year customers want the Sun and the other 4 months of the shade! As a result, the terrain is almost empty at the end of June."
105888,516876,5,Mike1961,15/06/2019,"This place is great. Completely uncomplicated, everything was very clean, currently almost free choice of location. If you like the outdoors, without constricting trees, bushes, fences, etc. is right here. it almost looks like a plateau. Some pitches also have electricity. You can even swim in the river near the foot. Definitely recommended."

105888,454822,4,globecar85,14/04/2019,Camping that is respectful of the environment in the Nordic tradition. Mainly occupied by dutch and german. Relaxing atmosphere. Sanitary flawless. By cons does not locate in the immediate vicinity of the river.
105888,422927,3,Graphyr,16/01/2019,"Nice campsite, nice couple of nights. Nice owners, Menno and Miranda. Provision is good, but a lot of iron residue (rust) in the water. Beautiful surroundings, good walking routes. For small campers: pay attention to the price; turned out high."
105888,411832,5,Josseandriesen,04/12/2018,"Lovely place, one night is too short! Many travelers decide to stay for weeks or even months. Great hosts, clean and large facilities, nice spots for both campers and caravans. The owners are very much involved and during the week they host an happy hour starting at 5pm, drinks 1 euro. There’s a restaurant with local food nearby and a river you can walk along."

Ideal departure point for large or small walks or bike rides. You can do your shopping in Ourique (10km). Oh yes, catch up every evening in the cozy log cabin with other campers. Everything neatly tidy and clean! Highly recommended!"

105960,966618,4,evaperles,15/08/2020,"A very quiet campsite, the pitches are large and many of them with shade. Very friendly staff, they gave us the option to choose the plot we wanted, although they had assigned us one. Wc, washing machines clean and in good condition. The only downside is that the pool is a bit run down, otherwise, quite good."

105960,766351,1,JuergenD,08/01/2020,The area in the immediate vicinity was contaminated by an 'accident' with plutonium. The last 'new finds' were in 2004 and 2006. Look for Palomares + atom bombs on the Internet and then decide whether you want to go on holiday in this area.
105960,743613,1,tanfran,15/11/2019,"Don't even think about entering! follow your path ... Besides expensive, bad!"
105960,672646,1,ilundu,01/09/2019,"I would not go back. Very dirty plots, full of cigarette butts and other remains. Bad access to the beach, very fair services and sympathy shines for its absence. Expensive for what is offered."
105960,664835,1,yokimotocojo,28/08/2019,"I would only go back for not sleeping on the street, he talked about a nudist area, they have mounted it in the final part of the campsite separated by a fence and left completely, the canvases of the half-hanging plots, the services not very clean, nor saw No one to keep them and right next to a field that at 8 o'clock was working with what looked like a short lawn since only the fertilizer was heard and smelled, to go to the beach cross the campsite and go back down and you get to a normal beach of jente with clothes, my advice is to either do it nudist or clothes but as this is ashamed, it is a shame and normal that in the middle of August it was half empty, I would not return"

105960,654528,1,javitxus,23/08/2019,"If the dream beach coincides, it becomes a textile campsite and almost no services, no swimming pool, because the recommendation of the camping staff is not to use them due to the poor hygiene of the festival people and their continuous spree and drunkenness. Not to mention the noise that must be borne as the festival is held there next door."

105967,2535096,4,jorest,31/12/2022,"We have spent one night, quiet area. Only the passing of the cars produces some noise but it has not been a problem, that is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5. With the signs that have been placed in other places in Puigcerda, one of the few remaining places."

105967,1720461,4,RamFerTo,30/12/2021,"We spent the night of 12/27 and it is a highly recommended place to rest, without noise and without problems. It is better to place yourself in a place a little away from the entrance because from early in the morning there begins to be a lot of movement of visitors to the hospital. A bit far from the center of Puigcerdà to walk, but it is worth it to spend the night."

105975,3278642,3,Cecilecharles,09/09/2023,"We slept here despite the other wilderness spot next door which is catastrophic, a bit noisy place but we suspected that but it was too late to go elsewhere.

In addition, next door there is a park area and picnic tables. In the morning there were some people walking and with puppies."
