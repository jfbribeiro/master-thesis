92715,1899344,3,MarkoDe,18/05/2022,"We had a reasonably quiet night here (just a bit noisy at times due to remote traffic). There is nothing else here, just a lot of space. But there could be something going on at the weekend - especially at night, since a disco is said to be around the corner."
92722,2564719,4,Leonsuewe,31/01/2023,"you can hear the few cars passing by, otherwise the place is really good, with lots of picnic tables and a few cats."
92722,2010220,3,silviamarinero,25/06/2022,"Small picnic area among pine trees, with tables, fountain and rubbish bins. The bad thing is the proximity of the road and the houses of an urbanization a few meters away, with traffic in and out, although it is quiet at night. We were alone."
92722,1168412,4,RubCar,05/04/2021,Pinada with a few tables and a fountain. There is a lot of shade and it is quite quiet despite being on the edge of the road.
92722,1132935,3,AdriCamperCas,25/01/2021,"Very close to the highway, but very little traveled. The area is fine, on Sunday morning a lot of people came to do hiking trails. There is a source that works, but it was all full of tapes for the Covid issue. I do not recommend going up with the van on the way up, you need a 4x4. I give it a 3 stars for the proximity to the highway and because there are houses very close."
92722,610762,4,Elpayofree,08/08/2019,"Excellent, except for the slightly sloping terrain in some areas and the road next to it (although it is quiet)."
92769,3260709,4,Nia21,05/09/2023,Very good overall. Clean toilets and very friendly staff. €20 per night for two people in a van. Disadvantage that there are no plots and very irregular terrain
92769,3227714,3,dmas,27/08/2023,"The location is very good, the facilities are old and the price: 4 in a van, €42 to spend the night without electricity. Before it was an affordable campsite, I remember about €24."
92769,3109035,4,JulioyMiriam,09/08/2023,"One star for the location, another for the pool, another for the clean services, for its pine trees from Soria. Vinuesa, Black Lagoon. Some areas look like shacks that make the campsite ugly. The reception is fine. The price also, we do not need electricity, camper and two people €27 Motorhomes and campers same price."
92769,3089229,5,Ezquerro,06/08/2023,"Very complete campsite, with all the necessary services available, clean and in good condition. Friendly staff and quiet and spectacular surroundings to spend many days. 2 adults in a van without electricity €26 per night. To repeat again."

92769,1835245,1,Mdeizco,18/04/2022,"Large campsite, wild camping style without control or order. It has very little flat area. Clean bathrooms but no soap. Small and old playground. The best thing is the bar, although when they open in the morning they hardly offer things for breakfast. Very little lighting. Elective records are scary. Cables lying around and the connections are terrifying. Be careful if you go with children"
92769,1467832,1,borjaymaria811,16/08/2021,"A chaotic campsite, difficult to find a place, points of light without meaning, park or campsites where you can and without organization, I understand the free camping, I like the concept, but a little sense and organization would not be bad, on the part of the employees From the campsite, they pass you by saying that it is free camping, having a great area in the area I will not try again."
92769,1410495,3,kikebarreda1960,05/08/2021,"Chaotic camping is not parceled out, each one places where he wants Mission impossible to find a level piece if it is in a pine forest, with which it has a lot of Sombra services just, enough Wi-Fi does not work well, it goes at times even so to spend an acceptable night, it hurts that the vinuesa area has no shadow"
92769,1362207,4,pelorojo,25/07/2021,"It is in the middle of nature, with lots of shade and uneven terrain and without parceling out. The old but clean and functional bathrooms, like the pool."
92769,1289065,4,leandromartin,01/07/2021,"Quiet campsite, parking lots with no defined pitches, dated facilities but clean toilets and showers"
92769,1279383,4,Salvana3,26/06/2021,"Camping in the forest very well located to visit Vinuesa, swamp and surroundings as well as to go up to Laguna Negra and Pico Urbion. the best the restaurant Quitauelve. on the campsite itself. fideua and spectacular baked lamb. the croquettes, the casseroles ... well, the whole menu is worth it ..."
92769,1036422,4,RichardCarapaz,09/09/2020,Camping in the middle of nature. excellent deal and price. without parceling gives an enormous amplitude
92769,999907,5,otxoa99,24/08/2020,"Camping at the foot of the road and in the middle of the forest. Without parceling out so that one can put where he pleases. Near the Laguna Negra, Pico Urbión, Playa Pita, etc. The facilities are somewhat old but clean."
92769,979371,5,dandindan,19/08/2020,"Very pleasant, surrounded by nature and well cared for. As it is not parceled out, if there are many people, it can be difficult to find your place, but then it is great to feel inside the forest, in a more natural location"
92769,951448,5,Rodripu,11/08/2020,"Campsite very well located to climb the Picos de Urbion. Pool, great bar and no pitches with very large sites. € 36 per day, 2 adults, 2 children motorhome and electricity"
92769,867462,4,mcendra,14/07/2020,"Two very pleasant nights in hot weather. At night around 14 degrees. On a hill of pines, shade to dojo. No plots, but with great breadth and freedom of movement. Impeccable sinks. Hot water. The bar, with a terrace overlooking. At 8 in the morning, the sound of bells. There are some kitsch mobile homes, but it's so big. No ACSI discount. Little coverage. Very nice wine"
92769,607718,1,PhD,07/08/2019,We went without staying because the sites are undefined and some have installed their mobile home sometimes with a Slum Allure ... a shame because the site is very nature. There was no real location so before paying take a tour of the site on foot to judge for yourself.
92769,371157,2,IKIMILIKILIKLIK,12/09/2018,"The place is very nice, the services always impeccable, but it is not a camping of the category with which it is announced, the lamb is to prove it, but breakfast is at a 5 star hotel price. Price for van as if it were motorhome, and above in the ACSI card do not discount, you see that only interested in going out in the magazine, very badly on your part."

92770,2671090,5,Akkiros,15/04/2023,"Excellent place to enjoy the tranquility of the mountains. Good access, lots of parking, picnic area by the river, garbage cans and a beach bar that should open in summer. I spent a very quiet day and night, practically alone, but it was during the week and in April, surely the weekends, long weekends and holidays are quite crowded. With the possibility of making routes from here."
92770,2670387,5,MimayPascual,14/04/2023,"Very calm. Close to the road, but you can't hear the cars. Possibility of bathing. There is a hiking trail from here"
92770,2447165,5,Borderontour,16/10/2022,"Super quiet, plenty of space for a large motorhome, Justo winged river, you can walk to the pools in 20 minutes, garbage cans and shade, routes to walk with the dog"
92770,2290014,4,elferredelronzon,23/08/2022,"We have had a perfect morning. There is a beach bar where they serve meals. You can take a cool walk to Las Pozas de Felipe, which although they were dry in August at another time, they must be beautiful."
92770,2288561,1,FranciscoNaval,23/08/2022,"The last time we were there it was very dirty. The bottom of the river dam with a lot of mud, it was very scary to step on it. I delete it from my favorites."
92770,2012429,5,maria399,26/06/2022,"good night, quiet. Let's take care of the natural space"
92770,1895898,4,eldelacajita,17/05/2022,"The other car park to the right of the bridge was closed for repairs, so we stayed in this one. There is movement during the day and music (not very loud) from the bar, but at night it is very very quiet. Level and with little coverage. With garbage containers. It is recommended to go up to the Pozas de Felipe. At night, be careful, don't step on the toads that come out of the river!"
92770,1867753,5,zaro,03/05/2022,"We have spent two very quiet nights. If we respect the environment, having places like this to wake up is a privilege"

92770,1822595,4,1978Canto,14/04/2022,"No services. With hardly any coverage. But the place is fantastic!!! walk along the river, walk to the pools, barbecue, bar... the sound of the river. We recommend it! Even if it's a rest stop."
92770,1772282,4,mariamgm,03/03/2022,"Very nice and quiet place to sleep, surrounded by nature and next to the river!!! I give it 4 stars because it doesn't have good coverage."
92770,1749943,5,Natas,07/02/2022,"Incredibly beautiful area, right along the river with picnic tables and a house with barbecues. On weekends people come to this place. In the evening there is no one left. super quiet. Trash cans available. Recommended!"
92770,1618204,5,vitoro,30/09/2021,"Good place to spend the night. We arrived at night and no one was there, nor did anyone else while we were there. Very quiet and fairly level site. The river does not bother to sleep, on the contrary."
92770,1543654,5,Federon,03/09/2021,"Very good place to spend the night, we sleep alone, the terrain is quite flat and with plenty of room for several ac. During the day, few people laughed next to it, the contact with nature was very pleasant. Today the chiringuito was closed I suppose because it is between the week and September, what if there are garbage cans. the really beautiful area with possibilities for walks in the surroundings"

92770,1309774,5,Longhinos,09/07/2021,"Great place to spend the afternoon and evening. Shaded parking spaces (large vans may not fit). The bathing area is great, with sand to make the entrance to the river more comfortable. Area with picnic areas and beach bar. There is a basin with running water (it does not indicate if it is drinkable) and garbage cans. tonight we were three vans and a motorhome. The garbage truck passes early."

92770,699467,3,KateMead,21/09/2019,"Good place, easy access. We arrived on a Saturday, only people here after 16.00hrs. Raining, but still managed to make a bbq in the hut from collected wood on hot embers left from other people earlier in the day. nicer pitches up the road to the right over the bridge, but not as flat."
92770,639316,5,Fernandofercu,18/08/2019,"In summer and weekends full in the day but very quiet at night. Kiosk with toilets open on these dates. If, after crossing the bridge, you follow the path on the right you reach another quieter parking lot. Little mobile coverage. Possibility of barbecue."

92793,1813089,5,Travelchicken,10/04/2022,In the spring great views of the lake great sunrises good place for fishing space for small campers. Please park in such a way that the locals still have space to park.

92793,1453704,4,olivier16430,14/08/2021,An authorized place: the guardia civil passed several times without telling us anything. A little passing for the locals but nothing too heavy. The view of the lake is nice but the lake beach is not very clean.
92793,794954,1,yoshi2016,13/03/2020,"No longer recommended, police came at 11:30 p.m. and took us to the parking lot in Zahare de la Sierra. Friendly, but very determined"

92793,753145,5,Cpudlas,13/12/2019,We travelled a little further from the gps spot down a narrow road for some more seclusion. Wouldn't recommend for wide vehicles. Great views of the lake. Windy but quiet night. Only walkers passing and a Shephard with a least 200 sheep! Great spot
92793,746404,4,holaquetalmuamua,23/11/2019,Really nice parking. Lovely village and great area for walking. Big local traffic of dog walkers and hunters but noone bothered us. Very beautiful!

92793,631645,5,heatherandrokas,15/08/2019,"We spent the first night by ourselves and it was bliss. Second night a couple more campers arrived but we still have our privacy.

92793,598130,3,RickPaz,04/08/2019,"End of July - A lot of passage during the night (car, moped) - Otherwise nice corner, strolls possible, source of sulphurous water nearby. Passage in Bornos quite narrow."
92793,483842,3,Cathethe,14/05/2019,Nice spot quiet and with a nice view of the mountains in the distance and the lake. A little frequented by locals evening and morning. A lot of mosquitoes and waste
92793,432025,5,conmanco,22/02/2019,Have spent 2 quiet nights here. Only a few locals come with their dogs over. It was also relatively clean. Garbage cans are about 150m up the road.

92793,424420,4,Pfeffer,24/01/2019,"The place is really scenic particularly attractive and with a 7m mobile home to reach. Not all the legacies of man and dog are so beautiful. A dumpster would be great, because I would like to pick up the plastic. In summer it will be more difficult to find a parking space here."
92793,411968,5,MurielEric40,05/12/2018,"Beautiful area. We went through the streets indicated by the GPS that is to say in the village and with our 7.5 m no problem because little traffic. It is a very quiet place, but we stayed only part of the day. The view is superb !!!"
92793,391892,2,MaeKris,12/10/2018,The place is actually very dirty ... arrived late at night we still slept there. The next day we realized that there was a small parking in front of the campsite.

92831,2952402,5,koalaiadan,12/07/2023,"Perfect place to empty gray and black water. We have been able to load water perfectly. Toilets with showers. We have spent one night (next to the trucks), before arriving in the Algarve, so it is a very good location (half an hour from Albufeira). A site like this is appreciated"

BUT if you end up sleeping there as we did and since we have a baby it takes us more time, be careful not to exceed the time limit at the highway! The ticket is only valid 12 Hours and there is no discussion but a big fine. :-("

92852,1807703,2,lifeo8,05/04/2022,"We had to leave in the middle of the night, teenagers were accelerating back and forth, shouting, etc. Loud honking at 2 a.m., just in front of the vans. It's a shame because without that the place was really perfect, calm, flat in a dead end... there is a nightclub next door so I think it must happen often unfortunately"

92864,2619838,5,livingPacolife,22/03/2023,"This was such a beautiful P4N. Peaceful and in nature. We were there a few nights and in the weekend and it did get more crowded by local people enjoying themselves nearby but still it was nice. The road to this spot is not so bad, for our transit 6m it was easy. There is only one road to here so you always drive back +/- 20 minutes to continue your travel but it will be worth it."

ATTENTION: According to the girl at the interpretation centre, you can park during the day but you can't stay overnight because it's inside the natural park and she recommended sleeping in the pueblo which is an area that in theory won't be a problem, we sleep in front of the centre. Pueblo is cool."

92884,1000973,3,ferdy,25/08/2020,The place is idyllic and until 1 in the morning everything is perfect. At that time a group of several cars and about 10 young people arrived with loud music.

92895,1207876,3,AMON05,20/05/2021,Nice place to spend the night. Toilet in the graveyard but closes at 10pm. Water at the playground. THE MOST ANNOYING are the bird scaring cannons in the near rice fields. They fire day and night to scare the birds and it is like at war. And this near to a bird protection area. We could hardly sleep. We wont come again to Ebro Delta.
92895,1191762,4,Talivan,10/05/2021,"We spent a night alone, quiet and without noise, except for a sporadic car passing by, parked next to the wooded picnic area of the Hermitage that consists of tables, swings, a fountain with drinking water and a trash can.

92896,2454870,3,Marielcris02,21/10/2022,Perfect place to park during the day. On the beach and next to the beach bar. I do not recommend spending the night because there is a lot of traffic. The AC moves when cars pass.

You can stay up to 3hours,more than enough to visit the whole city centre and even to reach the cable car station.
The big supermarket has all the typical English products.
There's a petrol station that has a very good price (£1.26/Lt!). 
We spent some hours here during the day, sleeping is not allowed."
92898,1798089,5,monikatomas,27/03/2022,Free parking. Near Main street. Perfect
92898,527279,1,StrohWueste,24/06/2019,Yep three hours not more. Got clamped for 3 1\2 hours. 80€ or 60£ only cash! so if you plan to stay longer stay in the outside parking lot and avoid trying to find parking inside and border traffic jam!

You can park 300 meters away if you arrive before and at 11:30 p.m. park here. Absurd, but they didn't let me in the next day if I didn't pay for the previous 24 hours for having arrived at 11:15 p.m. and not entering. There are more campsites nearby than if they want motorhomes."

The terrain is not very level, it is quite difficult to find a flat place as it is full of stones"
92953,2663120,2,stinkepfote,11/04/2023,"The road up is really extremely narrow and curvy. I just about made it with my 6m van, but turning at the top was a bit challenging because there were a lot of cars standing around. There are max. 2 places that are straight. Ideal for VW buses, anything larger is rather unsuitable. But I highly recommend the place to watch the sunrise in the morning."
92953,2067169,5,Ibiltariak,13/07/2022,"Very quiet night with another van. The bad thing is that it fills up with people to watch the sunset and there is not much place to park. I recommend going up a while after the sun has gone so you don't run into anyone going up, which is quite narrow."
92953,2018412,4,bomba94,28/06/2022,"We spent a very quiet night in this spot with our van. The view is really crazy and nobody bothered us! The ground is not very level but there are many stones that can be used to level. Just take two aspects into consideration. Many come to the lighthouse in the evening or early morning to run or watch sunrise / sunset, but no one has told us anything. In addition, it is quite exposed to the wind"

93002,2406346,1,i_rracional,27/09/2022,"Hondarribia does not want a camper or caravans. We were fined for sticking out of the lines, without disturbing or hindering anywhere, and after talking with the City Council, there has been no way to fix it.

93002,2182385,3,Georgeblonde,06/08/2022,"We have not spent the night but it is a quiet and well-known area. The only thing that when arriving at an AC that was parked there, they had fined him for invading the parking lot delimitation... the rear overhang got into the grass a little... like all vehicles at a small or greater distance... We have decided to go to the Guadalupe area."
93002,1950656,4,ptcarlospt,05/06/2022,"Who could have imagined that in a city with so many beautiful places, young people like to drink and talk loudly right in front of a cemetery? Good thing it started to rain and they left. Other than that, a good place"

I recommend this place."
93002,487797,2,zuckerstrasse,19/05/2019,"The specified place is very precipitous also actually only suitable for cars, unless one turns across. In a stormy, rainy night from Saturday to Sunday, I spent the night up the cemetery. As I said the weather was very bad and Sundays the cemetery is closed, no one has seen me there. That would not have happened in the summer."
93002,323208,1,msalvado,09/08/2018,"In summer it is forbidden to park in the entire town of Hondarribia, for vehicles over 5m and 2'20 high.

We have been parked next to the cemetery only in the morning and we have been fined at 1pm."
93006,3165055,5,RikVB,17/08/2023,There are 2 options (as seen on photo 2). Next to the road for easy access with large motorhomes and another one on the hill for smaller campers (harder to access). We parked on top off the hill and had stunning views. Amazing spot!
93006,2461732,3,MMBontheroad,25/10/2022,"Nice view. Pitch only for small vehicle, van size, because difficult to maneuver. Close to the road, a bit of traffic, but not too disturbing. However, a lot of wind. Close to the monastery so ideal before going to visit."

The entrance is passing the town of Lariño to the north, paved road, “Tras da Arca beach.” Just 100 meters away is the esplanade and next to the beach. We passed and we went by a back road and we saw ourselves black to turn around."

When we finally got there it was spacious, clean and deserted. Nice quiet night sleep!"
93063,1713658,4,NinJoe,21/12/2021,"Nice quiet place. The approach is a bit tricky. We went up in heavy rain, but you can't see the depth of the furrows. Some of these are very large. Otherwise we had a quiet night. The wind turbines didn't bother us or our dog. The ground is relatively flat and the surroundings are beautiful. The ruins above are also worth a little trip. Great place!"
