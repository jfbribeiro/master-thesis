98228,2573538,4,Adelaar,10/02/2023,Great place for the night. You cannot place larger than 6 meters or you will have to be antisocial. Wonderful for cycling

98228,1741359,3,MissSchwertfisch,25/01/2022,"Only 3 stars because the N2 is very noisy... Otherwise, a beautiful view, nice company in the form of parrots, working toilets and right on the grandiose ""Ecopista do Dao"" cycle path with a bike wash and air pump."
98228,831666,3,CAPFSC,21/06/2020,"Good place to park and ride the bike at ""ecovia do Dão"".
The toilets are very dirty (jun2020) and few shadow. Not very clean."
98228,819731,4,Pfarcadas,08/06/2020,"Small place near the old train station. It's quiet good to spend a night and do some exercise, like run if you like. Not in the city center like the others. If you camper as more than 6,5meters you may have a problem parking here"
98242,3119589,5,Lukil,11/08/2023,"What a marvelous hotel. Well the rooms we have not seen. They offer you free of charge and without the need to consume anything a private piece of land, closed with a gate although somewhat inclined. We stayed for dinner and breakfast and 10. Super nice and attentive waiters, and spectacular food quality and at a good price. highly recommended"
98242,2838184,5,pirusanti,10/06/2023,"Great place to spend the night. The hotel owner was very kind, he gave us the keys and we were able to enter. The restaurant is highly recommended, the food is excellent and the entire staff is ten. We feel at home!"

And had a great night the stars. Delicious food in the restaurant - would highly recommend, and a nice walk up in the olive groves the next morning. Clean toilets in the restaurant as well."
98242,2518972,5,Rutafamilia22,11/12/2022,"Mandatory stop, FABULOUS SITE. We came for dinner because it had very good comments and the food was great, a little expensive but well worth it. The friendly and attentive waiters, with many details. They let us sleep in a nearby plot of land with a key, which will soon be converted into a gas station. We had a great breakfast. Store with DO products Very clean bathrooms. nice fireplace"
98242,2277861,4,Eva_Javi,21/08/2022,"Ideal place to take a walk through the Despeñaperros Natural Park. Although it has no services, they lent us a hose and we took a good shower. The restaurant is very good although a bit expensive."
98242,2119571,5,Luisferbomb,25/07/2022,more than good treatment... we stopped for dinner (they have a delicious menu) and we asked the waiter about the parking for ac. He gave us a key to a plot next to the restaurant and there we could sleep peacefully and without any disturbance.
98242,2008535,5,yoetazu,25/06/2022,"Great hotel-restaurant, with majisimos workers. They let you sleep for free on their land, with views of the Despeñaperros gorge. Dinner and breakfast from 10, they also have typical products of the area to buy. Amazing place, food and people. Thank you!"
98242,1984544,5,Coke83m,17/06/2022,"Very nice owner. Unfortunately we didn't eat anything there, but the restaurant looks very good. I can only agree with the other positive comments."
98242,1829505,5,oscarDG,17/04/2022,"It's open. All very well, the truth is that they are very kind. They give you the key and you come and go as you please. We slept very well, very safe."
98242,1804975,5,Vero21,03/04/2022,"Owner and staff lovely and very helpful, we had lunch and breakfast there, they left us the key to access the land."
98242,1768235,1,kikofans,27/02/2022,It is closed
98242,1702755,5,anita25186,04/12/2021,"We have spent one night next to the hotel in the area they have for us and great, I wish more establishments would take notice and do it. The next day, we had breakfast at the hotel and everything was very tasty. A nice quiet evening."
98242,1661073,5,RoamingEastmans,25/10/2021,Would 100% recommend this place for a stopover. Ideally placed just off the motorway.The owner was very helpful and welcoming and gave us a key to the secure parking lot which is lovely and quiet. It is entirely free with no obligation but you can use the lovely on-site restaurant/cafe/bar if you wish which we thoroughly recommend.
98242,1634193,5,Trafictrail,09/10/2021,"100% recommended place. We arrived at night, they left us a key to open the car park and we did not pay anything. The next day we had breakfast there and everything was great."
98242,1632560,5,apasolento,08/10/2021,We arrived at almost 12 at night and Noa opened the fence ... totally recommended they do not charge anything but we had breakfast the next day and everything was very tasty ... RECOMMENDED 100%
98242,1353459,5,mateomorrral,23/07/2021,"Highly recommended to sleep en route, the exquisite treatment"
98242,1123286,5,laxouba,23/12/2020,"We arrived shortly before curfew and they very kindly opened the car park for us and left us the key to the door. The hotel breakfast is very good and they also have a shop with quality products. They told us that they would surely be open until kings and that later they would have to close due to the Covid restrictions, so if you are going to go anyway it is better to call before."
98242,1047619,5,marixavi,14/09/2020,"Wonderful place to spend the night. It is a fenced enclosure that they have kindly offered us in the restaurant. Somewhat inclined but there are flatter areas. They treated us in an incredible way, super friendly and attentive. You eat very well, the terrace is beautiful and we take away an indelible memory. We will be back!!! P.S. The croquettes very good."
98242,846153,5,Kireabi,03/07/2020,"We were going to Cazorla and it got late so we looked for a place to have dinner and sleep in the park4night. For the comments and the fact that they accept pets in your hotel (I loved that detail) we decided and great !! Super friendly, attentive and you eat very well. They have a land next to the restaurant where they let you stay for free. It is inclined but in a good part and we did not put even the chocks."
98242,793515,4,VicMc,09/03/2020,"We stopped to eat here before following our route. The waiter was very friendly, he treated us terribly and we ate highly recommended game meat. We also take the opportunity to buy oil in the store they have."
98242,592731,4,magalijestin,02/08/2019,The waiter at the hotel restaurant kindly offered us the secure parking of the hotel. Great space for us alone. A disadvantage: it is located near the autovia so the earplugs are necessary for those who are sensitive to noise. On the way we stopped at the campsite which is very quiet but paying (31 € for 4)
98242,391250,5,Soraya200777,11/10/2018,"A recommended stop you want to sleep in the area or not, the treatment and its exquisite kindness. They have a land they want to prepare to be able to give us service, at the moment it is not very flat, little by little, they will improve it, it is great, I wish all the hotels had their vision, we have to support this type of proposal. Try the partridge pâté. We have slept great and safe. Thank you, Antonio."
98257,1605030,3,GuillaumeF64,24/09/2021,Nice village but watch out for La Guardia
98258,2708960,5,zwoiufftour,30/04/2023,"Great place to get someone to or from the airport. Space is below the heaped slope - noise is kept within limits - 30 seconds each. I slept peacefully. Be careful, only the first part of the course is solid ground - do not drive too far in when it rains, danger of sinking."
98258,1842615,1,FPL11,21/04/2022,"To stop for a while, it may be fine. The impossible night with the noise of the planes. Too close to the airport."
98258,1688581,3,Lauravenard,14/11/2021,"We spent the night of November 13th to 14th on this spot and we slept very well. It is certainly not the most beautiful spot in Spain, but it is not the worst either. The proximity to the airport is not disturbing because very little activity at the moment, we only had 2 take-offs in 13h on site. Concerning the pilgrims, the path of Compostela actually passes 100m from the spot but nothing disturbing, the pilgrims are rarely noisy and rather respectful towards others!"
98258,666236,1,earthcore,29/08/2019,"Worst spot in the world, planes a few meters, pilgrims who go to St. Jacques spend a hundred since 4am ..."
98258,630850,4,Paharilla,15/08/2019,"Esplanade surrounded by trees, next to the road to Santiago, there are shady areas. No services"
98258,580355,4,Wumpette,28/07/2019,"Excellent spot, except the hundreds of walkers who spend early in the morning and the nearby airport"
98258,510413,5,Kezapied,10/06/2019,"Excellent spot, no service, accessible all sizes. Rocky soil in places."
98268,2707008,3,polalbu,29/04/2023,Very good place to spend the day and sleep. Easy access but it is the typical road with trees on both sides that scratch the van from end to end
98268,2275674,3,WimPersyn,20/08/2022,"Beautiful place, but I did not drive through it, the bushes seemed to me to have grown too close to the road (go and have a look on foot). I don't think my campervan would have hit it without scratches on the sides."
98268,1812045,5,freepatata,09/04/2022,"Access road for van not very large. The place is nice, good views and quiet."
98268,1404007,5,PabloS.N.,04/08/2021,"Very quiet place, narrow road, perhaps the motorhome will not enter ... highly recommended to spend the day, bathe and sleep peacefully."
98268,1352210,5,Fabrice76,22/07/2021,Dangerous entry and exit. path for small vehicles do not be afraid of scratches on the bodywork.
98268,859016,1,Jordiperez11,10/07/2020,Flooded area. Access is very difficult and you can hardly turn the car around. Apart from all the dirt there was. Nothing recommendable
98268,478968,5,annegwen,08/05/2019,Great location by the lake. Very calm night
98268,351811,4,Farkoss,24/08/2018,"Very good location for qqls nights, but difficult access for large size .... perso I have a van fitted ...."
98272,2767892,2,jmd44,20/05/2023,Narrow access road but in good condition and with crossing areas. Picnic area only. Very well laid out. Restaurant. Lots of local visitors. A sign at the entrance to the site specifies that it is forbidden to spend the night there... too bad the place is very pleasant.
98272,1488057,1,ilanoxman,20/08/2021,Closed for Construction
98272,918036,2,cordero,01/08/2020,"We arrived by chance due to a GPS error. Quiet place to take a bath, without services. The parking lot is small and sloping. Area equipped with several picnic tables and umbrellas and a snack bar."
98272,892539,2,Thierrysmj33,23/07/2020,"Superb place but not on the beach parking lot because it is too steep, be careful only 2 or 3 places and no lake view"
98272,732352,5,NeildePoulseur,28/10/2019,"Deserted, this day. Have holds"
98273,709221,2,deramofabian,30/09/2019,We were told that it was no longer possible to download in this place
98273,643810,1,superfamilyonroad,19/08/2019,We have not been able to see where the waters are emptied in either of the two directions of the march.
98273,585517,4,lapradetane,30/07/2019,Area with possibility of emptying waste water. possibility of refilling with water = 1 euro every 5 minutes
98273,542780,1,sergih,07/07/2019,In the direction of Girona there are no services for AC.
98295,3198042,5,monsieurpatatearoulette,22/08/2023,"Ideal for spending the night, gray water can be emptied next to the Marina. Park in the shade of trees. Afterwards, to go into the city you must have at least bicycles. Very calm night, first plane at 9 a.m."
98295,3152276,5,DavidPss,15/08/2023,"Plenty of space, little noise, nearby bins to throw away your trash. Very very few planes and at night none. Cafeteria nearby, to walk. Large shopping center nearby but to go by vehicle. Perfect place to visit Santander even if you can't walk, there is always a place to park, regardless of the time of arrival"
98295,3149956,5,Claudinemarque,15/08/2023,thank you to the municipality for leaving us this very quiet place and beautiful view of the port and the take-off of planes (which are very rare)
98295,3138556,4,osronica,13/08/2023,"Very quiet parking, little traffic. We stayed there for 2 nights. It's quiet at night without planes otherwise they are very close. A bit far from Santander. You have to walk 45min to the airport and take the bus that takes you to the center (3.2€ for a 10min trip every 20min)."
98295,2545362,5,Santiago2022,07/01/2023,"Grade, comfortable, fairly quiet, despite being next to the airport."
98295,2477362,5,frank1974,01/11/2022,"excellent place to park for free at the marina. I spent the first night at the paid area further down as I needed to recharge my batteries badly. then, moved here the second night."
98295,2275636,4,Titbell35,20/08/2022,Very nice space on one side the marina on the other the airport. Easy access by bike to Santander. Airport activity is amazing for one who loves. we were given advice to park with the door on the airport side to install a table and chairs so as not to be seen from the road. Quiet night.
98295,2253682,4,JEAN-LUCC66,17/08/2022,"Very good for spending the night there, quiet (without a plane until about 9am). Not much to do in the area, but at the gates of Santander."
98295,1621338,3,lolomachamot,02/10/2021,"Not that quiet place, plane continues from 8am to 11pm. Beware of pollution from airplanes when the wind comes from the airport, we were poisoned by gas from airplanes."
98295,1611610,5,Poopy33,27/09/2021,"I do not understand that people go to the ugly pay area, parked on top of each other in a fence. It's beautiful on one side we see the planes take off from the other port! It is really 5 * perfect for going into town by bike! We love it a lot!"
98295,1330416,2,rsef,16/07/2021,"Very calm, a little dirty, open and level space"
98295,1030948,2,Ikergarcia,06/09/2020,"A lot of parking space and lots of trees, a pity that people don't take care of it and it's full of garbage on the ground. I spent a night there and until 2 at night I couldn't sleep because some funny people were spinning their cars. a shame"
98295,1015285,4,Saramg,30/08/2020,"Good place to spend the night, in our case we spent a rainy night and under the trees we take shelter well and during the day there is shade. It is next to the industrial estate, the port and the airport, although we did not hear any plane, there were two more vans and in the morning people go out to run there but they did not bother."
98295,787184,5,crispons,26/02/2020,"We just stop to rest, many places without a prohibition sign, some noise when taking off the planes, during the day it is nice to see it."
98295,670576,4,rahiko,31/08/2019,"I was here for 7 days without any problems. Foot and bike path 7.5km around the airport. Only cyclists and pedestrians. Half way there is a nice little tapas bar. Bar Punta Parayas. We recommend. Quaint, cozy, sun and shade. On the lateral sides possibility to see takeoffs and landings. Big shopping center Valle Real 8 min by car. 1 departure. I liked it very much."
98295,655657,5,EmeSarah,24/08/2019,"We spent the day and the night. The ride by the bike path is great. We were 4 trucks, the parking is very big and shady. The night was calm :)"
98295,442459,3,7276,21/03/2019,Had 1 night parking next to the airport but no flight at night. Santander 10 minutes by scooter. A bicycle and pedestrian path goes around the airport 7.5km very well to do before the aperitif.
98295,365157,3,gemita,05/09/2018,Very quiet to spend the night and with shade for the day.
98306,1497512,1,CanKerberus,22/08/2021,"They have cut down the entire pine forest, it is processed in a pile, there is no shade, only an esplanade I suppose to plant."
98306,526734,4,japi,24/06/2019,Very calm. Some noise from the highway but little since it is quite far. Ideal if you are passing through and do not want to sleep in the typical road parking. So you can get up and have a quiet breakfast surrounded by small trees and birds
98306,475396,2,chainsaw,04/05/2019,"Not a cat, arrived Friday at midnight, nobody and the same Saturday. Road easy access without rut. Only downside: we hear the highway which is awkward with a vw california (roof ""pop top"")"
98306,417327,4,zakowich,29/12/2018,"Made without a hitch with truck crate 6 m long in dry weather, dirt road that climbs a bit so I will avoid after the rain (so big size). Flawless spot, beautiful view."
98324,2987536,3,AridaneRP,19/07/2023,"Paved esplanade but with inclination. It has no spare or services nearby. But it is the only place to park the AC, the rest of the car parks near the beach are not suitable for vehicles over 5 meters."
98339,1912346,3,forero,24/05/2022,"In principle it should receive 5 stars, if it weren't for the closed services or for a non-existent bar. I will not be able to speak of a quiet night, due to the dogs barking only compensated by the songs of the Pirol and the nightingale in the morning. There is nothing to thank the city council, they did not put anything, all the infrastructure was financed by the EU."
98339,1654725,5,limonsin,21/10/2021,"Great Area, Thanks to the city council for this effort Now what we have to do is take care of it so that they see that we appreciate the good details,"
98339,1129563,4,DobloDiaries,10/01/2021,"We parked here for the night and it was very quiet. No one around. There’s a little water fountain nearby. Has restrooms, but they where closed..."
98339,1076499,3,Rossemary,30/09/2020,"It is a parking lot for the Béjar Greenway. Greenways, by the way, great. Near the village. What I didn't like is that I saw several peeing right there, and not from motorhomes, or vans, but from the same town, and then they blame us ..."
98339,1017992,4,Javieg,31/08/2020,The parking lot has water with a small hose adapter. Otherwise quiet place separated from the town and where the greenway begins There is plenty of space to park and it is quite flat
98339,978725,4,saultrafic,18/08/2020,"The parking is good for sleeping, it is one km away from the town - there are cars until approximately 12, the best thing that the greenway passes through the parking lot the bar of the old station is open on weekends on weekdays nothing. we did night only two motorhomes."
98339,963494,5,abril18,14/08/2020,"Quite flat parking, next to the greenway, there is a tap where you can get water, but you have to transport it, the bar open from Friday to Sunday, and the toilets are also open on weekends. The population deserves a visit."
98339,879372,3,aldipa,18/07/2020,"Fairly flat, although without services. Site for a bike route or walking along the old road. Lovely people at the Bar and attentive. Very flat"
98339,554718,4,mikel82,15/07/2019,"A very quiet place but it is no longer as in the photos, it is somewhat neglected by the town hall, since weeds have grown, at night there is no lighting, for everything else we have spent a very quiet night, recommended"
98339,435363,5,danisf,02/03/2019,"It is a beautiful place with very easy access, quiet and with good views of the city of Béjar in its old part surrounded by the wall. It has a couple of restaurants next to the parking lot. From the parking lot you can go by bike or on foot along a natural path that goes for the moment to Hervas in the direction of Caceres and Navalmoral de Bejar to Salamanca."
98350,2085781,1,rociopastor,17/07/2022,"The civil guard passes by opening a file. They do not allow vans to park. They have come at 8 in the morning with everything collected asking for parking papers. only that the vans, not the cars... the access is very complicated potholes of great unevenness in the terrain. a lot of caution"
98350,1881192,4,Jakob.K.,10/05/2022,nice beach/bay difficult to reach for most cars as the road is VERY bumpy with bumps up to 30cm deep. not for large mobile homes and weak nerves when it comes to your own car.
98350,1753307,1,Miki26,11/02/2022,Nothing for mobile homes! The street is completely destroyed!
98350,1503704,4,exvegano,23/08/2021,Before it was a lonely place (the foresters came to tell you that you couldn't camp there) now we were 7 vans. We saw how a car broke the crankcase with a stone on the road. Only for people with experience behind the wheel or 4x4. It fishes well. We left very early in the morning.
98350,1488203,5,Botta_d,20/08/2021,"The place is super quiet and a few minutes from the beach walking. There is plenty of pine shade and plenty of room. The last part of the road is very destroyed, you have to be very careful. There is no type of service"
98350,1243534,4,Samuelbar44,08/06/2021,"Very calm night, some van with us. To access the car park, it is a one kilometer path but accessible by van or converted truck. And then the beach is a 5 min walk."
98350,1235828,4,pim74,04/06/2021,"Nice parking in the woods, a few flat pitches. Beach less than 5 minutes. No noise. Ideal out of season."
98350,1171106,5,RedPepi,09/04/2021,"Our favorite place! The road has many potholes, but when you are there you can choose a beautiful spot in the forest and it is only a few minutes to the sweet bay of cala torta and the beach! super wonderful !!"
98350,946623,5,JulienO.,10/08/2020,Beautiful protected area but impossible to sleep there at the bottom of the rutted path ... The police cordially came to tell us that we could park there for the day for swimming (even if this is prohibited) but that we could spend there the night. We therefore went to the parking lot above for a very quiet night.
98350,929794,5,T2bbaywindow,04/08/2020,"Track accessible by van don't worry, it's worth the detour. Shaded, calm with very beautiful beaches, small walk. Watch out for surf, wave and rip currents."
98350,926501,3,julili4,03/08/2020,"We did not dare to venture far from the sign indicating the names of the beaches. So nothing spectacular about the view we had ... On the other hand, we walked to the beaches (about 30 min) and there were quite a few vans so it was doable."
98350,796821,3,Yereimy,20/03/2020,"The cart is not recommended for motorhomes, if for vans and 4x4. Until today the road is a bit complicated due to the potholes. You can sleep. During the day there are people but then there is no one. You will be able to hear the birds and walk along the beach at night. It is accurate."
98350,561201,5,erdeivi,18/07/2019,"You sleep in luxury in the shade of the pines and the scandal cove, very close to the parking lot."
98350,558798,2,zugas,17/07/2019,"Complicated access. We arrived with a Ducato, but the last meters carefully. A very quiet place to spend the night. 5 'walking from the beach. Recommended to go late at night and leave before noon."
98350,545639,1,RuteBlue,09/07/2019,"In summer it is a full one, it is peta of people. The road, the last stretch is bumpy. I advise camping early in the evening and leaving when people arrive. In winter it is more appreciated to go to the area."
98350,380346,1,Loloiodei,23/09/2018,Impossible access from Cala Mesquida
98375,2945172,4,Vaness68,10/07/2023,1st beautiful spot in Spain. Nice location for swimming and spending the night. Attention fishermen arrive early to set up
98375,2259976,5,nodetenerse,18/08/2022,"Windy paradise… but paradise. Depending on the water level, you can stop and set up your home in many places. Cool and long and beautiful sunsets! Of ten !!!"

98375,2179832,4,fabianstamate,05/08/2022,"This place is beautiful, truly. The water is blue and the space is pure nature. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that this place has a serious amount of bugs. We have been a lot of places with bugs but this place is on an apocalyptic level! For this reason we only stayed one night."
98375,2128264,5,JeanCayron,26/07/2022,Great place. Magnificent view and feeling at the end of the world. Perfect for one night. Not disturbed at night despite a certain wind. Small flat for mosquitoes.

98375,2085842,3,BarbaraMendez,17/07/2022,"Beautiful view. But we woke up next to a dump of poop next to the car. There were already flies, but the stank was unpleasant. Quiet night, a little bit windy. Not the cleanest place. Easy access to swim. Some trees for shade. For a night it's okay."
98375,1643616,5,kikibn,14/10/2021,Extraordinary place we spent the night in the small parking lot a little further on the road 20 m from the small lake. Cherry on the Navarre ochres sunrise over 2 gray herons and a multitude of birds and egrets little ducks. . not to be missed ... sublime when you wake up

98375,1449781,4,vieuxjames,13/08/2021,"During my visit the water was low. Many places to park. A few in the shade but rare. In the morning, visit from a very friendly guard who informed us that fires are prohibited, that it is possible to stay overnight but not to camp for a week. The site is liable to flooding."
98375,1279554,5,mkel1,26/06/2021,Mostlikely the best parking spot I have been at yet. Super pretty! You can go swimming in the lake and look at the stars at night.
98375,1173781,4,Laulos6813,14/04/2021,Very nice site. The bad thing is that there are mosquitoes but it is bearable

98375,499185,5,Pierrec,01/06/2019,"Only in the world facing the lake, no mosquitoes for us (early June). Swimming possible and small promontory to eat in front of the view. Perfect! Rather for small vehicle because little space to turn around and get flat for the night."

98380,2554167,2,brittaHeArt,17/01/2023,"I couldn't settle here, I didn't feel comfortable. Loud hum and dirty air from nearby industry. Always cars with one man and one woman who parked for 20 minutes and left again........ I slept very badly and left early in the morning. The other campers didn't seem to be bothered by it, not recommended for highly sensitive people like me."

98424,1826156,4,el_vizorro,16/04/2022,"There is something magical about it - you park directly on the riverbank, you fall asleep to the sound of flowing water. There is plenty of space and it is a known place."
98424,1583308,3,moutri72,16/09/2021,Certainly nice place but the gps coordinates do not take us there
98424,1392788,5,ErwanBERTHELOT,02/08/2021,"Friendly and calming place. Difficult to find, however. Great for an overnight break. Little noise except the sound of the flowing river and a little heard the road next door, nothing annoying. Secure location, three vans are next to us but everyone's peace of mind guaranteed. Walk the trail and you will find a nice transparent blue bath, a little chilly nonetheless."
98424,1321703,5,clem64,13/07/2021,"2 nights in mid-July, very quiet place, near the water where you can even swim, and well shaded to stay cool! Too bad not everyone respects the places with their waste"

But you have to take it into account"

98424,428905,5,unmondea5,13/02/2019,Super nice location. We were dislodged by the civil guardia around 10am pretending that the place is in a natural park. This is not the case. No fine. Very quiet and ideal for swimming.
98431,2500353,2,La-Lu,19/11/2022,"A place with a lot of car traffic all night, not pleasant. Also, a guy came to knock loudly on the window of the van at 4 am to ask us for money, I don't know if his intention was to break the glass, but he was very insistent and disturbing, we had a bad night, I don't recommend it."
98431,2430167,4,Edouard2706,08/10/2022,Parking very well located but very noisy on Friday evening.
98431,2263585,2,Glovetrotter,18/08/2022,"The site is fine if not for the noise caused by the cars passing by until dawn, which already lessens a bit. The price of parking is €1.6 for four hours, which is the maximum allowed. Also the tram stop is very close and this takes you to the city center."
98431,2203349,4,claps78,09/08/2022,"very good for visiting the city by taking the tram, the one we priced (line 1) made in 1944 is magnificent. to sleep it seems noisy because on the side of the road."

98431,1540028,3,coucou2,02/09/2021,"Very noisy because of the main street and the busy fishing until late at night, but with a beautiful view of the city and the river at night. On Sunday mornings a small flea market with some delicacies for breakfast. You have to be careful not to be parked. The parking lot is more suitable for cars. The possibility to drive backwards into the parking lot did not open up to us"

98432,2960781,5,Jaroga,14/07/2023,"We have been 2 days and we have spent the night without problems. It is a very large parking lot but without shade. At the Information Office they confirmed that you can spend the night both here and on the dirt plains in front (which look bad due to the dirt accumulated there). You can reach the center on foot in about 15-20 minutes. In the parking lots in the center, next to the beach, they don't even let the AC park."

To the old town you walk about 14 minutes. Reserved for the market on Fridays from 6:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., so you shouldn't stay overnight from Thursday to Friday."

98432,471839,3,Laruski,30/04/2019,"It's like the parking of a shopping center. We have practically slept alone, but without ""any charm"". We have not raised the roof or removed tables / chairs. Far from the center and the beach (walking half an hour)."
98432,467464,3,nasara,25/04/2019,"The parking does not have any charm but it is very practical, squares to spare. Better to park near the playground, further away from the main road. It is in the upper part of Conil, so you just have to go down to get to the center and the beach."

98473,964865,5,geco,15/08/2020,"You can get there with a dirt road that you take to the right of the a-232 coming from Mora de Rubielos. The path is recognizable by a dilapidated stone house located at its entrance. They are about 500 meters of dirt road, easy. At the first crossroads, keep to the right, a small short climb, nothing complicated. There are a couple of open spaces, a few hundred meters away from each other, suitable for parking, stony but level ground. Stunning place. I don't feel like recommending it to large campers."

98490,1101034,3,TaniaSerrano,21/10/2020,Next to the lagoon the king and the pink perch restaurant. We spent the night and had breakfast in the restaurant. The only drawback is that it is attached to the national and the coming and going of trucks and cars can be heavy for the rest. But for the rest the area is very good. Surely in summer it will be very full.
98490,1018618,1,niniarta,01/09/2020,"We were determined to spend the night there, but when we arrived and saw the parking lot, with a lot of unevenness and zero charm, we went to the area for motorhomes of the Castillo de Peñarroya and it was wonderful. If you are in the area I recommend you go to sleep there, it is about 19 km."
98490,924120,2,elenanus,03/08/2020,"We slept one Saturday night and between the big bottle and the music in the park next door, the rest was difficult. It may have been punctual, but the kids stayed until 6am with the music and shouted loudly among the vans that were parked. For the rest, the parking is dirt, with shadows, picnic area, stream and beach area enabled for bathing. Of course, there is a lot of mosquito."
98490,867091,3,Guinma,13/07/2020,"It is currently the site that they have enabled to spend the night.

98492,1807792,5,NAIKEROB,06/04/2022,I have been to spend the afternoon and for my dog to enjoy being a dog beach. I did not spend the night but it seems to be filled with motorhomes and campers. The day I was there was full of them.
98492,1778194,4,cogito,09/03/2022,Overnight stays are probably still tolerated at the moment. Even if the vehicles are longer than 5.50m.

98492,1526553,2,Alutxiflora,29/08/2021,"Very noisy. I suppose it will be due to the circumstances of a pandemic, but I was there last weekend and I was like a kid with music in the cars and on the beach. I moved to the parking lot next door where all the motorhomes are and so richly."
98492,1363153,4,mlmgm,25/07/2021,Parking for the Agua Amarga dog beach with direct access to the beach. It fills up on weekends and in summer. Careless people with the rest of the vehicles that cross the camper instead of respecting the sites and camping. Let's respect the rules!
98492,1339614,4,elgriegonet,19/07/2021,A great place to spend one night or more. In the summer it’s a bit full but in the winter it is the perfect place! Just in front of the sea! 4 stars because in the summer is really busy durring the day.
98492,1241090,4,Marratxi,07/06/2021,"Last Sunday we slept without any problem. Some airplane noise until 12 at night. This parking lot will be lost if people don't ""civilize"" themselves. People with an awning outside, tables, even some caraoque. Removed from those in music, those who least respect the rules are foreigners."
98492,779716,4,BellesBimbles,13/02/2020,Lovely place with a bus 15mins walk away  into Alicante. Bins but no other facilities. We stayed on and off for 4 nights with the local police passing by in the evening but did not say anything but in the morning we were asked to leave. Not sure it helped with a large Motorhome with their awning out the day before. We should respect park ups are just that and not display camping behaviour.
98492,754447,1,Lule1,17/12/2019,Forbidden for vehicles over 5m in length

98492,426369,4,Wal0606,03/02/2019,"Great place! Airport and road do not bother at all. The sea drowns out all sounds. The RV's are worse. Although there is enough space, they have to be taken seriously. In the 3 days I would have to change places twice to have my rest. People!!!! Keep your distance !!!!! Only four stars because supply and disposal is missing! Highly recommended:-)"

98492,420647,4,Juju70,06/01/2019,Beautiful spot. Peaceful despite being near the airport (surf drowns out the planes). Great view of the sea as you park basically in it! Plenty bins. Nice to be allowed to take your dogs on the beach too.
98492,416093,2,mef,26/12/2018,"The only good thing about this place is that motorhomes and dogs are allowed which it seems that in Murcia this is unusual. Try to park as close to the waves as possible, the noise from planes, trains and automobiles is constant. If you are looking for peace and quiet, don’t stop here at night. We only stopped because we had tried several other P4N stops where big signs forbid motorhomes and it was getting late on Christmas Day."

98549,411418,4,lyd.jas,02/12/2018,Very nice place! Great views over the sea and a nice beach to hang out for when the weather is good. Two notes: place is very uneven and possibly only suitable for low season.
98549,409479,5,Tuckerbus,23/11/2018,"Most beautiful place we found in Mallorca. Parking of a restaurant, which is closed in winter. We stayed for two nights, which is tolerated by the police. Great view over the bay and Cap de Formentor. During the day some hikers, at night we were all alone and had our Ruhe.Mülltonnen available. Swimming on the beach possible."

There is no good atmosphere anymore, we will not be back anymore, someone put glue on our AC locks. A shame."

98555,987114,4,Furgonetear,21/08/2020,"The area is very good and it is very quiet. We were also last year, the only thing I have to say is that people do not take care of the sites because from last year to this it is full of pee, poop and pieces of paper. You have to take care of the sites, in the end it is normal that the people who live around are fed up with the motorhomes and label everyone as dirty"

Police came late afternoon even said hola not a word about moving. Came back at 9pm telling campers to leave. some were sleeping.

98634,2982820,3,CoralieCedric16,18/07/2023,"very beautiful park to visit for free with a river of ducks and you can see pretty green parakeets, the toilets come out of service there is a water fountain but which is also out of service .. because of the drought... parking without shade but in Barcelona not many parking options to sleep"
98634,2628889,4,lalaandjavi,29/03/2023,"Great place for parking near barcelona, we slept there and felt safe. It is located in a low emission zone, be careful if you have an old van, you could get fined."
98634,2546838,4,Bahars,08/01/2023,"Clean, quiet, safe, central, easy access to Barcelona and toilet in the park or a few meters further in the café. Lots of movement during the day, many dog owners in the evening, very quiet at night! I've stayed here for several nights"

98634,1579269,1,regorsnas,15/09/2021,"You can't sleep here, the police are coming. there is no shade and it is not very well leveled. I don't understand how it can get such good reviews."
98634,1518407,1,antocl,27/08/2021,"Indeed the place is calm. There is even a police put-to-bed and wake-up service. I think it's possible to spend the night but it's not really tolerated by the police, in low season maybe"

10 km cycling to the city center but totally worth it for the peace of mind considering all the other horror stories you read about other parking spots."

98634,916994,4,ArthurGimenez,01/08/2020,"Quiet and comfortable place to spend an express night. With the n63 bus that passes by the parking lot, you will reach Plaza Cataluña in 45min."
98634,494751,5,hansthevan,28/05/2019,Superb for our needs. We were reluctant to park in Barcelona as we had read a lot about vans being broken into. It is a very very long way to cycle in from here but brilliant if you love to cycle!! there is a tram line that probably goes into Barcelona. Park with toilets wasn't open when we were around but maybe during the day! Quiet and friendly locals.

98675,3017482,4,JEAN-LUCC66,25/07/2023,"Very good to spend a night. Only small inconvenience the noise of the road nearby, but little passage however. The most annoying are the dogs barking at night. On the other hand, very positive point, we confirm the passage of the baker with his small van, around 9am. Nice corner of the countryside near a nursery."
98675,2843034,4,Moji2ks,11/06/2023,Some traffic on the road but perfect to spend the night in the quiet area. path to walk the dog next door

98675,1676308,4,ster888,03/11/2021,"Super quiet place, we are alone sleeping but without problem! It is a bit inclined so a chock is needed. We waited for the baker but he did not pass :(, I guess he only spends the weekends"
98675,1661809,4,Albertotrafic,25/10/2021,"We were the night from Friday to Saturday. Us and another camper, quiet place, little traveled road at night. The best the donuts, Neapolitans and the bread that were brought to the door of the van."

The night with rain accompanied and have 2 AC for company too. 3 seats AC. Our AC of 6.50 comes in just right. The baker, very nice, comes in the morning, bread and pasta. I recommend."
98675,1373631,5,ritayandres,28/07/2021,"Very quiet, a little inclined, with chocks it can be solved. At 9 o'clock the baker woke us up, we bought bread, Neapolitan and delicious muffins, all through the bedroom window without getting out of the car."

98675,1310568,5,EvaBuu,10/07/2021,"Ample parking, we were only two motorhomes. The car park has a slight unevenness, but it is very comfortable and almost priceless. In the morning the town baker passed by selling bread in his van, a nice touch that we liked, especially the breakfast hehehe"
98675,1131166,4,calichy,17/01/2021,"Quiet place to sleep. Off level a bit. Signposted caravan sites 3. As it is Sunday morning, enough cars have arrived to go to mass. The parking is shared. It has no services, no garbage can. However, these sites are appreciated to be able to spend the night."
98675,1061620,4,GabriSuarez,21/09/2020,"Asphalt parking without services. somewhat uneven but salvageable with the chocks. The places reserved for AC are very short, to the point that one of 6.40m does not fit. Despite being close to the road, we have spent a quiet night as there is no excessive traffic. We came here because in all the Cabezón de la Sal car parks they have put signs of prohibited AC's and vans."

98675,983985,4,Jugon86,20/08/2020,"We made the night to go see the redwoods. Curious town to see with works and small art exhibitions scattered around the town. If you go by bike there is a nice river walk. We slept 4 vans, very quiet even being along the road. At 9 in the morning the baker came by."
98675,978207,5,jafaga,18/08/2020,Very quiet despite being on the side of the road. The places for motorhomes are short so if you go with a bus it is difficult to park. We with a car and a karavana have parked in the back one and we did not bother anyone. The town is quite curious to see and we did not expect it
98675,965099,4,mondeperfect,15/08/2020,"It is close to the road but at night there is hardly any traffic. We slept very well. There is a confectionery-workshop (San Juan confectionery) 2 km away with pastries, cakes and delicious breads"

We were alone, very calm and even the baker passed in the morning when he saw us there offering us bread. It is worth the visit to the town and the river path, beautiful."
98675,651452,4,Ceilidh,22/08/2019,"Nice, tranquil place for the night after arriving off Santander ferry. We were alone. Easy to find opposite the church, 3 spaces allocated for MH overlooking beautiful countryside. Easy walk into village. No facilites, a bin across the road and recycling in the village."
98675,650365,5,NaiSemgiKing,22/08/2019,It is an area in a beautiful place but we continue towards Cabezon because there was no more AC / Camper and we prefer to always have neighbors
98675,614047,4,ruticion,10/08/2019,"Very quiet place to sleep, it is a delimited parking lot with spaces for motorhomes, next to the entrance to the town and the road but it is little traveled and there are not many noises"

98676,3234252,5,estebanweisi,29/08/2023,"We spent one night here and it was quite good. Very crowded during the day. Sporadic cars and even police patrols come at night, but they didn't tell us anything. No amenities except a foot shower. Be careful with the branches of the trees, they can scratch the roof of the car."
98676,3127453,1,Henrrubi,12/08/2023,"We have spent one night and we do not repeat. A lot of party noise and there is also an incessant hum of some installation. It is dirt and due to its large size it becomes crazy to park… dust everywhere. In addition, there is no control and the cars park where they want without leaving space to leave."
98676,3082779,3,RXAMMC,05/08/2023,Too much dust. Perfect for going to the beach. We spent a night and noise of brats with the car spinning and with the music. Otherwise well.
98676,3060225,2,GabrieleBonzi,01/08/2023,"Parked one day and one night with 7m overcab. The only plus point is the convenient access to the beach. For the rest I can't find other advantages: very dusty, at night several groups of boys from ""botellón"", celebrating with loud music and shouts. During the day it fills up with cars parked without defined spaces, which makes it difficult to get out of the parking lot with bulky vehicles"
98676,2971467,3,BielMenorca,16/07/2023,"This land car park is in the Maritime Terrestrial Zone. You can park during the day without removing anything, but at night no vehicle can be there. The fine is €3,500. Better to park on paved streets of the urbanization."
98676,2957572,4,sanesu,13/07/2023,"Fantastic place because it is the parking lot of the beach. Better to arrive in the afternoon to choose the site. If you plan to leave early the next day or before 6:00 p.m., keep in mind that it fills up with cars and getting out can be complicated. Otherwise, sleep super well and the beach 10. There is a shower at the access to the beach. I don't give it 5 stars because the floor is dirt and it raises a lot of dust."
98676,2917201,5,Petitbonhomme,02/07/2023,"We had a good night on this large dirt parking lot! Little rooster when you wake up, a stone's throw from the beach. Water point"

There is a picnic area with large wooden tables, very shady under twisted ancient trees. That night I was riddled with mosquitoes from the beach but above all sleeping in the parking lot."

98676,1619079,4,Wohnmobil-Klaus,30/09/2021,"Large public parking lot that is full of cars on the day. It is only a few steps to the beautiful sandy beach. It's a parking lot where you shouldn't take out your camping furniture. You can sleep in the camping vehicle. Restaurant, shops, pharmacy and supermarket about 10 minutes away."
98676,1509164,2,valkiria-travel,25/08/2021,"A dusty parking madness, everyone parks as they please. With a large vehicle difficult to put it in or take it out at rush hour. The only good thing that is next to the beach that is worth a visit."
98676,1481013,4,iontxu93,19/08/2021,"Good place to sleep, next to the beach, quite dusty, sometimes it seems that there are kids making bottles with the car, but since it is the large parking lot you go to the other end and there is no problem"
98676,1453233,4,jogigi1,14/08/2021,Large parking lot next to the beach. At night there were some kids making a ruckus but in the end they calmed down and left. The police have come to do a surveillance round around 2:00. We have slept several AC and vans
98676,1371108,4,Cirlis,27/07/2021,Huge parking lot next to a beautiful and long beach. We slept one night although we did not repeat because of the dust and some noises of kids partying.
98676,1171115,5,alcavic,09/04/2021,Good place to spend the night in AC and van. very wide with area near hiking Now it is even calmer due to the issue of the pandemic. We are three motorhomes staying the night
98697,3192884,5,musafirin,21/08/2023,"Spectacular site, the only hit is the strong wind there is and more if you go with a roof tent in your vehicle. Also to say that it is usually quite crowded, but the good thing is that there are several places on one side and another and you will surely end up loving one. Super easy to get to, you won't need a 4x4"
98697,2890483,5,iVagamondi,25/06/2023,"You don't need a 4x4 to get here, but you do need to be tall to maneuver. If you have a van it's fine, avoid if you have a camper, especially if you are longer than 6 meters. Before entering take a look ""on foot"" to be sure it's not already occupied, it will be difficult to maneuver if there are other cars, so check first."

98697,2485238,5,FCV91,06/11/2022,We stayed for two nights on the spot a couple of meters before the end of the road which provided us with a stunning 270° view. When we left we got stuck as the ground is a lot more sandy than it would appear. Only got out because other campers pulled us out. So only 4x4 as recommended in the profile of this spot.

98697,1649552,5,Gunnar99,17/10/2021,"Top place for a night or two, 4x4 might not be necessary but depends on the weight of your car.
VW T5 is about the maximum width that can drive there."

98751,413586,4,Landy130,11/12/2018,"The place is OK, exactly as described. Only in the afternoon sun, due to location directly on the slope, north of the mountains."
98761,3238220,4,montsefrancesc,30/08/2023,"The camping site is flat and quiet, but not very clean. To get there pull back that you pass through the installation of an electric power station. We stayed one night when the harvest began. For this reason, shots are occasionally heard, which are intended to deter animals that might eat the grapes. Even so, we slept very well as it is quiet and peaceful."
98761,3002981,5,makepause,22/07/2023,Lonely place with great scenery and the opportunity to swim. Spent the night there
98761,2652671,4,park4night804,09/04/2023,We spent one night in this lost and abandoned but beautiful place at the same time. We woke up with the chirping of birds. A pity that it is not more careful.
98761,2607551,4,LuisHevia,12/03/2023,"Quiet site, very level and well accessible. There are containers and a water pipe. Perfect to spend a quiet night and dawn there. The spectacular dam is worth seeing."
98761,2035464,4,FredericFox,03/07/2022,"The parking lot at the former and disused Club Nautico. We spent one night there. It was very quiet, lonely and deserted. A footpath of about 5 minutes leads to the beach. Meadows were mowed, garbage cans, otherwise no service. We couldn't see any prohibition signs anywhere. Access via the dam wall. It's a pity that there is no official place set up here between steep vineyards."
98761,1119356,3,lgte,04/12/2020,A shame because it could be a magnificent place but everything is abandoned. The buildings and the roads. There is a very nice one to do from there but at the beginning you have to avoid the fallen trees in the middle of the way. Good coverage
98761,1045571,4,hugobaltasar,13/09/2020,"We stayed one night comfortably. However, several cars passed at dawn."
98761,711234,3,brigidacastrelos,02/10/2019,We spent two nights. we made the route of the vineyards of belesar. quiet and comfortable site. sir services
98771,1377536,3,yagodivx,29/07/2021,"Large parking lot, without any service. Despite being next to the road, it is quiet since there are hardly any cars passing by. The town, its river beach and trying the local gastronomy are well worth it. It is essential to visit Colinas del Campo (10 minutes by car). Too bad no AC area is enabled in the area"
98771,1118257,3,Burgaillo,28/11/2020,"Truck parking on the side of the road, lonely. I did not like."
98771,541753,3,amicalement,06/07/2019,"Roadside parking (uncrowded). Suitable even for large sizes (several heavy weight seats). Rocked by the noise of the brook, night calm and carefree."
98801,2376647,1,MrSoze,16/09/2022,"we were yesterday and in that place you can't park an AC. I would even tell you that not even a camper because it does not have a parking area, only the highway. It's small and not pretty, cars are constantly passing 3 meters from you."
98801,732809,2,esencia,28/10/2019,"Even in summer, the shadow that you can't find elsewhere was appreciated, but at the end of October ... I didn't like it. It is next to a chicken coop and full of cleenex .... it is also very small and does not stop people spending a minute. There is a source but with hose it cannot be used"
98817,2708565,5,tonetaalicante,30/04/2023,"Let's go with ac 7.5 meters. Several horseshoe curves to access, but paved and without problem. We have slept great, without noise. Awesome views, under the wall, and level. Site to turn without problems. nice neighbors. Within the town, please do not camp."
98817,2539982,3,Caravanadominguera,03/01/2023,"Let's see, his thing is to park where the places are marked, not to get into the very park where the fountain is. The first because there are children and second because it is the esplanade used by older kids to skate, play music, play ball and I see it as a worse option. The small parking lot that is a few meters away is preferable. You have to come, it is super quiet and with a beautiful setting."
98817,2476861,5,AnaM8,01/11/2022,"Super quiet and flat, under the wall and a beautiful view in front. Village water fountain and small playground"
98817,2258595,1,elnido18,17/08/2022,"If you have trouble sleeping it is not your place, in the park a lot of noise even the most 'mm"
98817,1854038,3,igejo,26/04/2022,"Quiet place, silence and with a fountain that is of great help, I parked a 7m AC in the same fountain, nobody says anything, the neighbors tell us that it is normal, it is where almost all of them park, the location is not correct, we send inside the town and you do not have to enter, I will try to send the correct location"
98817,1589399,3,PetraSheriston,18/09/2021,"Amazing winding road up to the town, fantastic views. childrens playground but other than that you are just parked at the side of the road at the top of the town. Night was quiet, and we slept well."

98839,2249546,4,chabulosa,16/08/2022,"in the middle of a pine forest, with few flat spots. During the day movement of people to access the extraordinary and difficult to access house Platja de Coll Boix"
98839,2239101,4,47592771K,14/08/2022,"The car park is ample, although the terrain has a slight incline and there is little flat space. Access is complicated, as the road is narrow and the final section has holes. Even so, you sleep in the middle of nature and you wake up near the beach, which allows you to arrive early in the morning and enjoy the beach alone."
98839,2188824,3,sophiednnhsr,07/08/2022,"Nice place but very difficult to access. Parking lots are very sloping. We were there from Saturday to Sunday - not recommended, as many locals walked to the beach and partyed there. But otherwise nice."
98839,2159592,5,kanika,02/08/2022,"The road starts well, and on the road 2 fit, letting each other pass, then it narrows and the potholes begin in the ground, quite large, especially in the last section, we with a Ducato L3, we got it slowly slowly, but good. You sleep very well in silence. In the morning, around 10 o'clock people began to arrive who were going to the cove. To access it, better with slippers"
98839,2107253,5,FaustineRiles,22/07/2022,"Nice place to sleep. The path is not obvious because the road is damaged but the place is nice. Totally in the woods, no water or toilet. Possibility to swim in a cove not far from there. Really nice."

98839,1497791,4,sidzero,22/08/2021,"Good place to sleep, quiet Access is complicated, a very very narrow road some of the roads and the end is made of stone, we sleep practically alone with a visit from a goat, the bathrooms are closed and the water there is not drinkable, the route to the beach It is very beautiful, but the final access is difficult, between rocks (bring plenty of water). And on the beach ... more goats, it's cool, it's worth going"
98839,991783,4,lereina,22/08/2020,Access is difficult. The road is bumpy and there is a lot of unevenness. But the site deserves it. We literally slept alone in the middle of the forest surrounded by mountain goats. A little further up there is a shelter and services (currently closed). Coll Baix beach is a 30-40 minute walk along a beautiful but difficult to access route
98839,970620,4,2en1C3,16/08/2020,"A beautiful place, surrounded by nature. The road to reach the area is dirt and narrow and full of potholes, slopes and stones (not recommended for motorhomes and large vans). The parking area is quite uneven. We did not stay to sleep because being Saturday there were many cars of people sleeping on the beach."
98839,692603,5,MariaL.A.,16/09/2019,"Perfect place to spend the night, without noise, very quiet, only nature is heard. A little above the parking lot, about 100m., There are 2 tables, a fountain and a shelter and bathroom, both were closed when we were. It can only be accessed by walking. Perfect place to go down to the cove."
98839,396356,5,Smax56,20/10/2018,"Parking in the middle of pines, not a sound, quiet, 20 minutes walk from the plaster of Collbaix, splendid place to advise."
98854,3277719,1,JesusMarta,09/09/2023,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT, a very unsafe place, after spending the day in the cove I was surprised that the window of the van was broken and what I had inside was stolen, luckily everything of value always goes with me. The cove is very beautiful for snorkeling."
