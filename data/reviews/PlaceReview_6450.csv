84866,852897,3,penngann,07/07/2020,"I preferred to ask myself a little higher. At the entrance of the forest, between the trees. there is room. I spent a day and a night there without any visit or problem. And 2 minutes from the beach."
84866,302817,3,Rtc,27/07/2018,"Did not stay the night since you are just parked along the street. Good for going to the beach and bar, use toilet and shower there."
84891,3277432,3,Txape62,09/09/2023,"Very large campsite with several different areas, many permanent users, new area for AC, no shade, waiting for the already planted trees to grow, no Wi-Fi in the new area. poor quality-price ratio."
84891,3074872,3,sarabara,04/08/2023,"Service at reception a bit borderline. To go to the new area you have to cross the residents' campsite and the road is very narrow. The new area does not have any kind of shade, plots with completely dry grass. The only thing is that it has a fairly large pool, an area for children that is very good with a water park. A bit expensive for what they offer."
84891,2241155,1,Litelman,15/08/2022,"Bad treatment and edge of the reception staff, despite giving arguments to leave the plot a day before, I do not know how to return the money. They charge you €8 per person and they do not let you use that extra day that we are not going to enjoy to pay those €8. You tell them ""now I understand the bad reviews on the internet"" they reply ""but still, here you are"" super polite. sewage treatment plant that makes a lot of noise and smells a lot."
84891,2173534,3,IreneH,04/08/2022,"Campsite with many private pitches and no shade in the camping area or delimitation of pitches. The slides and pool ideal for children (and not so children), but the slides without any control. Little cleaning of the toilets and a lot of noise at night without any control. We had some neighbors shouting until 00:30 and when we went to tell them they lowered their voices but didn't shut up until 01:30."
84891,2035063,1,raulrisko,03/07/2022,"To access the camping area you have to cross the residents' campsite along a narrow straight line that 2 cars do not enter, the rubbish area is super far away, in plots water and sewage. no Wi-Fi, no shade, bathrooms far away, noisy sewage treatment plant on the corner of the campsite. They charge you everything when you enter and they ask you for the dog's chip number. for children very well by the pool and water slide. enter 14 exit 12"
84891,2034986,1,anderberg79,03/07/2022,"Not recommended to go in AC or tent campaigns with the price so expensive that it has. No night entertainment, no Wi-Fi, no shade, pitches with dry grass."

84891,1110589,2,dlpd,01/11/2020,"Campsite used at the end of October Expensive (45 euros for one night 2 adults 2 children), no hot water, access to chemical toilets limited by request for a key at the reception (not always available) paying wifi"
84891,994379,4,hbl,23/08/2020,"Huge campsite with good facilities, renovated and clean bathrooms. In the new area with little shade, to empty the toilet you have to ask the reception for a key and there is no specific place to empty gray. The campsite is huge and is quite crowded with bungalows. For me too many people ..."
84891,866102,4,borjasl,13/07/2020,"The camping is fine, fairly new common facilities, cleaning could be improved, it does not have a specific point for filling and emptying motorhomes. In the new camping area there is no shade. The pool and aquapark very well. You can see a family atmosphere."
84891,663114,3,nuketown,27/08/2019,"Camper area in the final part of Camping, an esplanade without any shade, large plots with light and water (each plot with tap), camper area with new and fairly clean toilets. Swimming area with swimming pool and also some trampolines that you do not find in many campsites, to go to the town necessary car since it is on the outskirts. At the time of reception I would put a need to improve."
84891,625995,3,Alai,13/08/2019,"Great campsite but very tidy. Although initially filled with mobile homes, there are plots at the end which are shaded but not large. Beside the toilets, a bar, a children's playground and a small aquapark. Further swimming pools, a shop and another bar. In August, € 34 for two adults and electricity. Recommended"
84891,565720,1,laialaieta,20/07/2019,"The previous comment is wrong. € 46 have been an adult, two children and wifi (without electricity)"
84891,562847,1,laialaieta,19/07/2019,"It is a campsite with permanent mobile home almost 90%. To the vans and caravans they send us at the end, an area without any shade or grass, a dry land. Far from the pool and everything. The aquapark is without a pool. € 31 adult and two children without electricity and with wifi. For camper it is not worth it."

84891,437057,3,evadiesel,06/03/2019,"In low season the closing hours for doors is at 9pm, less on weekends. At the door of the campsite you can not park the AC. You can not do barbecues. The squares of AC are at the end of the campsite, they are big with water and light, which you climb by jumping the curb. Hot or cold water does not mix. Sports facilities, swimming pools, toilets and restaurant very well."
85003,670484,4,Didiruca06,31/08/2019,"We already knew this place some time ago, parking is available to go to the beach sa basin and precisely the problem is this one, now there are many campers and camper vans people who want to go to the beach complain of the space, part that more than one have no respect. The place is idyll, flat with shadow and the cove next door, at night pass cars that seem to annoy us."
85003,577952,1,Rodrigo232323,26/07/2019,Attention Police come to fine !!
85003,557797,5,peach_hdz,16/07/2019,"Very good place to spend a night and very close to the coast (difficult thing for the area). The cove ""Sa Conca"" which is 5 minutes walk is beautiful. It's hard to get a place in high season, but it's worth it. We slept one night with 4 more motorhomes."
85003,553426,4,verschuere,14/07/2019,Very nice we are staying in the day and lots of cc are staying at night. 2 minutes from the beach.
85003,546095,4,Beatrixtorres,09/07/2019,"Good parking area to spend the night, silent and in front of a very beautiful cove. Platja d'Aro shopping area 20 minutes walk."
85003,545228,1,RR82,09/07/2019,"In summer you can not sleep, at night come the kids of the disco to make botellon and put the music of the car at full volume! Even some couples are parked next to you to do a kiki and you with the kids inside. Shameful! To top it off, in the morning people come to park to go to the beach and they threaten to denounce you. I had a bad time, the truth"
85003,545219,1,JBOSCH,09/07/2019,"This area is a parking lot, not a camping area. One thing is to spend the night one night and the other to drive the motorhome one week, hang clothes .. as if it were a campsite. Last week the police came to get people and put fines because they were dirtying everything"
85003,532663,5,SARAI,29/06/2019,"Great, silent and on top of a beautiful cove."

85003,467777,4,Roel964,25/04/2019,"We are now for the second time. Quiet place, near the beach. But ... Last time a hubcap was stolen from our Fiat Ducato while it was stuck with ty-raps."
85003,449638,5,lord_kudos,06/04/2019,Really nice spot. No-one here during my stay on a weekend during low season. Would definitely recommend for a nice night sleep. The place is isolated considering its proximity to everything. Highly recommended
85003,447304,4,Miildii,31/03/2019,It was quiet & nice to sleep. However in the morning one smaller camper got robbed through the side window. They just went to the beach for an hour. We saw two young guys in baseball hats luring around...
85003,442578,4,The.Wicksy.Wanderers,21/03/2019,We stayed one night. Quiet despite being next to the road.
85003,442177,3,Goueno22,20/03/2019,No particular advice quiet parking what ... just for one night for us ...
85003,441790,4,laspescadillasviajeras,19/03/2019,"Quiet night, although it is next to the road but it is little traveled. The cove is beautiful and you have a lovely walking route"
85003,439676,4,thecourts,14/03/2019,Very quiet parking place overlooking Port D'Aro. walking distance of small beach. Shops Aldi Lidl Decathlon about 30mins walking distance past the marina
85003,429197,4,cocoetjuju,14/02/2019,"A perfect stop along the road very little and close to the access to the beach. By cons, a bit far from the city center to walk."
85003,386467,5,ferymarina,02/10/2018,Site with surplus among pines. Little traffic Plain. Several parking spaces at 2 minutes from some coves. You see the sea Far from the buildings
85003,385835,5,fablaure29300,01/10/2018,Calm and pleasant place very little passage. I recommend.
85003,385244,5,Roel964,30/09/2018,"Free parking, quite some shade and only 150 meters from a very nice beach!"
85003,384931,5,nacho1773,30/09/2018,Ideal site Very calm. The police passed and did not say anything.
85003,381913,5,imbender,25/09/2018,"In September: ideal for the night. Quiet, flat, shady, 5 minutes from the beautiful beach."
85003,342110,5,jakas,18/08/2018,Very quiet place at night and shaded during the day. Very close to the beach. It's the second time we're going and both times we've been very happy

85003,306745,5,omareliasjb,30/07/2018,Quiet and flat to sleep near the beach!
85003,304233,4,Kagirre,28/07/2018,"A great place to sleep. A lot of shadows and a flat place. Sa Conca beach 2 minutes walk, there are showers. There is no service at the place of sleep. Good place to sleep. Dark and flat place. Two minutes from the Sa Conca beach, there are showers. Good place to sleep. Many shadows and flat place. 2 minutes away from the basin beach where there are showers."
85003,303411,4,Suki,27/07/2018,Flat and very comfortable place to spend the night. Fairly frequented.
85016,2593811,1,AgnesRonto,28/02/2023,"DO NOT PARK your van UNATTENDED anywhere in Barcelona! Whatever type of van you have, the thieves are specialised for robbing the vehicles as these are the only places you can park: in the city there is simply no free space. Rather pay a fee in a secured parking lot instead of endangering your belongings!!!!!"
85016,748955,1,Carolrc7,01/12/2019,"Not recommended, better go somewhere else"
85016,403510,1,MPBen,03/11/2018,"Sector at risk. We parked our vehicle along the artery near the metro Vall d'Hebron, when we returned the road side window had been forced, obviously the thieves knew the model of our car."
85017,3147139,4,bia24,14/08/2023,Very nice campsite with a small beach on the river (also suitable for children). Warm welcome and good restaurant. It feels like family. Dated but clean bathrooms. The only flaw is the current that occasionally jumps.
85017,2629529,3,wanderfalken1,29/03/2023,"Early season and a totally quiet place. We are alone here on the meadow directly at the river, the dog can move freely; just beautiful. The entire system including sanitary makes a very neat impression. The site is open from April 1st to September 30th, 2023 €28.50 for 2 people Van Dog without electricity is just too much in the preseason!"
85017,2410401,5,bimobil230,28/09/2022,Beautiful Campsite. with shade and sun. we were stranded with heavy camper damage. helped with transport to Madrid and took us to the pick up point. Spacious and a clean sani super shower Nice and good restaurant.
85017,2239354,4,Carsifer,14/08/2022,Quiet campsite with large pitches. Close to the river where you can swim and with many places to walk.
85017,2235579,5,Partner_Van,14/08/2022,An amazing place to spend a quiet night. The facilities are very neat and clean. There is also a park for the little ones and a bar/restaurant for the not so little ones. We spent one night and the price is very good for everything it offers.
85017,2220013,4,Gachas,12/08/2022,You eat very well at a good price. Good attention. Book dinner and lunch! Cool area to walk and for the kids to play.
85017,2139604,2,annasi,29/07/2022,"The campsite is beautifully laid out and the shower and toilet are clean and the staff was very friendly. However, there are many children (we think holiday camps or something similar) who are very, very loud from early in the morning until late in the evening. The noise doesn't bother us at all, but we find the price a bit too expensive (over 33€ for one night with a camper, two adults, dog & electricity)"
85017,2102056,1,annece2104,21/07/2022,"This is the first time I've written a comment… 200 or 300 children screaming until 1:00 am, at 8:00 am super loud music like in a disco, no shower, no water, blocked toilets, no internet, cold water for washing up, almost got yelled at when I wanted to order food because I hadn't booked (??? how could I guess that?)…we would have hoped for at least one symbolic discount in view of these conditions but we have not paid in full... we invite the campsite to protect its customers a little from all this mess or to privatize the place next time..."
85017,1866524,4,movastar,02/05/2022,"Very idyllic and quiet location by the stream, sanitary facilities are simple but clean with a really hot, good shower. Friendly staff, but unfortunately hardly speaks any English. Free choice of space and little operation at this time of the year. 25 euros for two people with a smaller camper rather expensive."
85017,1555835,5,ULTREIA,07/09/2021,Great site but many many many flies
85017,1528937,4,MeriPS,29/08/2021,"The cozy campsite and clean facilities. Laundry at € 3. Large cafeteria, good breakfast toast. Very tasty pizzas for dinner too. The bad and important thing is that there is no coverage. Neither with Yoigo nor with Vodafone. Any. Wi-Fi only comes in the cafeteria, not in the rest of the campsite. There is also a lot of mosquitoes, which has nothing to do with camping, I understand, but there was a lot."
85017,1516018,5,JuliayPepe,26/08/2021,"Spectacular setting. Clean campsite, with bathrooms and showers in good condition. It was half empty when we arrived and we had no problem choosing a place. Friendly owner. You sleep with the sound of the river in the background, spectacular. But the flies and mosquitoes did not let us enjoy as much as we would have liked. Good price."
85017,1493770,5,familitortatomi,21/08/2021,"Reasonably priced campsite, with clean toilets and showers, treatment of the boys who take it very friendly and with the river next to the pitches that relaxes a lot"
85017,1470292,5,coro4,17/08/2021,"Camping with river beach and pets allowed, we had a large plot, menu food for € 18, very rich, clean and well-kept facilities, very good attention from the owners"
85017,1450786,4,Elipc,13/08/2021,"Very nice people although very, very slow when it comes to giving you a plot and registering. everything super new, very clean the restaurant of 10. the plots are not well signposted, they tell you more or less where to stand and then there is no room for more people to get in and they stick to you. They gave us a plot on the edge of a curve, we had to move the van so that a motorhome would pass."
85017,1354113,2,wendellthingre,23/07/2021,"Decent site sizes, but the way they’re arranged means people are walking across your site all the time. Has a nice place to swim. In an odd location, not much of a view around. Way too many kids for our liking, quite noisy. Facilities are small for the amount of people, everything always seemed very wet. Fine for an overnight stay and a freshen up."
85017,1325791,5,SteKohler,15/07/2021,"Small but nice place. New sanitary facilities. The restaurant is very good too. The driveway is a bit steep and narrow, I wouldn't want to come with a large trailer, but no problem with our bus. I would come back in a heartbeat."
85017,1239892,5,HoliSoyPatri,06/06/2021,"Camping Valle Do Seo. It is a small campsite but not lacking in detail. They have a pitch area and a free camping area, with access to electricity if you need it. Sinks, laundry, bathrooms with showers in perfect condition and very clean, a fabulous playground with trampolines and everything. And, a great bar (you can see the good reviews on tripadvisor). It is phenomenal and a privileged environment; the green of the mountains and a river with access to a bathroom that is a joy (cold, like all rivers; but great for the delight of adults and children). Finally, highlight the wonderful treatment of the owners and employees, super friendly (they are nicer than pesetas), always attentive and waiting for you to have the best experience. In addition, the price is very competitive (€ 20 camper with 2 people). Without a doubt, highly recommended. We will repeat, we have been wanting more !!! PS: 30 minutes away is Las Médulas (a must see, it is very beautiful)."
85017,1171064,5,Rapera86,09/04/2021,"Super quiet and beautiful campsite, very friendly owner, house type showers and very hot, just one flaw, the bathroom was full of mosquitoes ..."
85017,963771,4,xit0,14/08/2020,Cozy campsite with access to the river from where a path starts and you can swim. The restaurant very good and the services were fine.
85017,923039,4,machinzanas,02/08/2020,"Small but fine, quiet, shady and very family-friendly. The ""beach"" a great plus. Correct cleaning."
85017,922598,4,siscuriba,02/08/2020,Small campsite but with clean toilets. Small plots. It has a river to bathe. Narrow path to get there. No wifi in plots. Cozy
85017,848550,5,VANdi2,04/07/2020,"Very nice and cozy camping. We only stopped by for a shower and took the opportunity to have a drink, as it was nice to be there. Very clean sinks. Tranquility and super friendly service. Not every day you find a place with such good vibes :) A 10 !!!"
85017,369283,4,Eff,09/09/2018,"Nice, small place at a brook located."
85017,303388,5,lecamionbleu,27/07/2018,Small very nice campsite with restaurant. Small stream just behind cold but relaxing. 3 pers a van and electricity for 23 euros
85017,292422,3,Homerino,18/07/2018,"The boy who wears it is very kind. The plots are a little together. The access is by a road that only fits an ac, if you cross a motorcycle you do not pass. I had the bad luck of doing a night one day that it rained a little and the power flowed continuously but it paid the same. The wifi did not arrive so it is perfect if you want to ""disconnect"" literally. Furgo, 2 adults, small dog € 23.40"
85038,1751599,4,myothercarisaStuka,09/02/2022,"Good place to sleep. quiet. plenty of space no night trains. Jerica is worth a walk round, interesting bell tower and moorish Castle ruins. I walked to the top nice views. quaint Town."
85038,468640,5,rosazomenyo,26/04/2019,"Parking without services, next to the train station. Excellent conditions for parking and overnight. Very plain"
85056,653558,3,30051962,23/08/2019,Really nice and always these beautiful granite tables. Stop to eat awesome + water. You also have a campsite in this village the owner is French. I will stop at my next visit to this beautiful region.
85067,3227399,4,simolipiovanlife,27/08/2023,"Nice spot, near the lake with good activities with kids."
85067,3039494,5,frjmaya,29/07/2023,"I have spent the night here and tonight I will repeat. It is a marked public parking. It is a pine forest, nature, I spent the night very quiet, there was only one motorhome and another van. there is a town 10 minutes away for anything."
85067,2929898,3,Cristian.Vito.w638,06/07/2023,"It's not bad if the parking lot below is full. It is dry, a lot of dust and very uneven. In summer, from 11:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., it is impossible to be inside or outside the van (or in the shade). To spend the day in the swamp and then go to dinner in the van well."
85067,2483050,4,phoheisel,05/11/2022,very nice quiet and great atmosphere in the morning (:
85067,1803684,4,robinreems,02/04/2022,very quiet this time of the year. a lot of places to park. not every spot is very flat. we didn't use the facilities so I don't know if it's open now. we stayed 1 night with no problems
85067,1572429,4,sergio.marco,12/09/2021,"A perfect place to spend the days, a lot of shade and little crowded, a bit of garbage in the pine forest, but it is perfect"
85067,1265313,5,TanquetaGiorgio,20/06/2021,"Great spot to spend a few days in the ourdoors climbing, mountainbiking and water sports at the lake."
85067,1174949,5,yako242,17/04/2021,Perfect to spend very quiet and safe days.
85067,1164512,5,dfsilveira,02/04/2021,It is a huge pine forest with a multitude of squares along the dirt road that goes down to the hermitage. We spent 2 nights at Easter with many more campers but distanced from being so wide. we will be back.
85067,1155065,3,navarroivann,21/03/2021,"A spectacular site but in the whole area a lot of processionary caterpillar, eye children and animals. With medium and high temperatures it is better to avoid it."
85067,1148488,4,Fraruocco,07/03/2021,"We have spent a very pleasant night among other caravans. We have arrived late but we have still found a fairly flat plot. The site is in a beautiful pine forest, recommended."
85067,1138805,4,Diegocali,18/02/2021,"There is some flat area, a place integrated in nature and quiet, perfect for spending the night and doing activities."

85093,3284005,3,maria29ac,11/09/2023,"We arrived one day at 9:00 p.m. and it was already full, the next day we returned around 6:30 p.m. and there were places free. I called the number on the door and the man who answered the phone was a bit unpleasant, he opened the door for us without explaining anything. After a while a woman arrived for the check-in. There is hardly any shade, showers cost €1/5 min and it cost us €15 without electricity."
85093,3283794,4,KatiandKris,11/09/2023,Perfect place to stay. Everything you need. Good proximity to the beach. Only negative points are 3 out of 4 toilet cubicles are not closable. There is a lock but out of alignment and you either hold the door or wave to the people
85093,3276504,3,mimimopi,09/09/2023,"The area is very well located, the facilities are quite good, although the cleaning service in the bathrooms should be improved... what seems unfortunate to me is that they charge whatever they want, I was there on September 4 and they charged me with electricity 25 euros and then I met another person who had been there that same day and had been charged 20 euros with electricity."
85093,3271722,5,josianesouchon,08/09/2023,stop off in this superb area next to the sea and a pretty seaside resort. all sanitary conveniences bread laundry. Secure with code. Spacious marked out pitches. walks paths in height and small creeks. fills up in the evening and again yesterday not full. 15 euros without electricity. 20 euros with. No noise.
85093,3210771,2,marcguille,24/08/2023,"The Area itself is fine. Now, this non-reservation is an absurdity that must be ended. We travel quietly and that's how we want to do it. It's as easy as charging the first night. As simple as that. The opposite is to make things complicated and without giving a real service. It is not acceptable.

85093,3121542,5,lauraarisasancho,11/08/2023,"Perfect location for one night, the beach is not worth it, a lot of posidonia, the town is also good for a drink. area with washers, dryers, wc, shower (for a fee), with sinks for washing clothes and dishes, filling, emptying gray and black."
85093,3118637,4,amaiav,10/08/2023,"Excellent location. Next to the parking lot of the beach and the town. Clean toilets, the 5 minute shower is enough. We have stayed 3 nights (from August 2 to 4) and all of them hung a full sign in the middle of the afternoon. I would repeat for sure."
85093,3060162,4,Sandalias,01/08/2023,"Gravel and dirt area. Very well located if you are looking for a beach destination. First line. All services, a little more shade is missing.

85093,3013470,5,Camperoespanol,24/07/2023,"We had a fantastic night here. VERY quiet spot, even as the little town has its Féria , and the beach is packed. Still the camping is tranquil haven.  It’s mostly no frills, but you have your services, paid shower (good! People have to save water!) , clean toilets, washing machine. Part shade leveled gravel pitches .2 min’s by foot to beach . Very honest price . 20eur in peak season - unbeatable"

85093,2958915,4,MarLoren,13/07/2023,An area with good and new facilities on the beach. We don't give it 5 stars because we arrived at 10pm and they didn't notify us that the next day we had to leave at 12. We thought it would be 24 hours since you entered... shower €1 (gives you time to shower perfectly) €20 with electricity €15 without electricity If you only need to do emptying and filling services it is €5. It is very well located.
85093,2939433,5,DaniaL,08/07/2023,"It is close to the beach and in the heart of the town of Aguamarga. How much with all kinds of services and very well. It is very calm. It has a children's playground. I recommend going at 10 in the morning, which is when the girl is there. If you arrive at night, you probably won't have a place, we were there in July."
85093,2931469,5,lostresvanenvan,06/07/2023,EXCELLENT. The treatment by the girl. The environment and location of the area in the same town. Plots and services. All. We repeat two nights without being followed. They were both wonderful. Have tapas in the bar in the town square and go to the cove in the middle. I recommend everything 100%
85093,2922114,5,riviera2016,04/07/2023,"Extraordinary area, very cosy, clean, with all the comforts, quiet and a step away from the beach and a charming town.

85093,2899128,4,JorgeKatie,27/06/2023,The site is very good but the reception hours are very restricted (about 4 hours in total) and the phone number left at the door is incorrect (there is another one on a large sign that is the right one). Services such as showers are paid but everything is fine and clean. It is also very close to the town and the beach.

85093,2862552,5,thymofischer,17/06/2023,"Are already the 2nd time here. Palm trees have been added again. The facilities are constantly being improved. The place keeps expanding but manageable. We especially enjoy the evening stroll through the streets. The picture in the office is of Agua Amarga in 1951, it's a must see. The walk along the coast is recommended, but sturdy shoes would be good."
85093,2843644,5,Shorty21,11/06/2023,"Stayed here for a total of 2 nights. Everything you need on site, even things you won't find on many campsites (washing machine). Internet doesn't work that well and the showers cost €1/5min. Sanitary facilities are cleaned daily. Electricity on each plot for 5,-/day. VE on the pitch is fine too. Garbage disposal 150m outside."
85093,2835547,2,ForrestTheFord,09/06/2023,"The location is great, especially since you can no longer use the big parking lot in front because they put up a height barrier. Not much to the town except from the beach. The reception is only open a couple of hours a day. You receive no information when you arrive and have to find out where everything is located yourself."
85093,2813709,5,nathmlht,02/06/2023,"very well located, very clean, welcoming, no noise at night. a great restaurant in the village: ""el trasmallo"" where the fisherman offers family cuisine based on his catch of the day"

85093,2727498,5,Holly2274,06/05/2023,"We liked it. Good location, clean facilities, nice place. Places narrow, but awning still works. Gate is always closed. €5 for electricity is too much. We don't need one. Garbage container about 200 m in front of the gate. Could be improved."
85093,2726431,5,Emiliopovedano,05/05/2023,we leave delighted with the treatment received by the girl who attends the area. very clean services the set of rooms in perfect condition. large parking spaces. Everything is very correct. Recommended to all motorhomes. We will be happy to return.
85093,2720208,3,TaniaSerrano,03/05/2023,"Good facilities, shower for €1 5 min. Close to the beach, the only option to sleep, but we must be consistent, for those of us who do not need to take out chairs, etc. €15 a night seems excessive, being able to spend the night in the nearby parking lot, they put a height barrier...3 stars because it is well set up and good facilities, not 5 for the whole town."
85093,2705618,5,rusocervera,29/04/2023,"It has everything you can ask for, services, showers, clean, proximity to the beach..."

Everything is very clean and well maintained and we continue to invest. Nice little town, not too crowded with tourism. Therefore 5 stars from us!!! We'd love to come back."
85093,2665962,2,Lidiali,12/04/2023,"15e without light, 20e with light the area (for summer season) there is not much more a small town and beach. Little inhabited right now and without activity, small plots to remove the awning."
85093,2664662,2,pedrocogo,12/04/2023,"Good situation but very small plots. There are no containers nearby. Rude receptionist. For 20 euros, out of season, it seems excessive to me. At the entrance there is a parking lot where you can spend the night, much more recommended than the area."
85093,2654200,5,Amadver,09/04/2023,Very good experience. Very close to the beach and hiking trails. Getting a plot was difficult but MNieves made room for everyone. Just two minutes walk from Agua Amarga. The last day the showers came out with cold water and it would be nice if they had some two-phase adapters for forgetful...
85093,2642107,5,temarga,05/04/2023,"Perfect to spend several days. During Holy Week it was quite full, but there was no problem finding a place at 10am (when they open). Well-kept facilities and clean bathrooms. The shower is €1."

85093,2617777,4,jasmineraye,20/03/2023,"Really lovely place to stay. Not even a 5 minute walk to the beach. The beach says no dogs however everyone walks their dogs on it so we did too. Not many restaurants open this time of year but can highly recommend La Nonna, staff are lovely and food is great. All in all, a really beautiful place to stay and explore the small town. Minus a star as stayed another night and dog barking ALL night"

85093,2557799,4,Norkyautomation,22/01/2023,"This is an ideal site to go and chill out. The local bars weren't open much, they opened it intermittently but it didn't bother us. If you intend to stay for more than a couple of days probably best to stock up on provisions before you arrive.
Currently the reduced rate represents good value but am additional 5£ for a shower block would put us off."
85093,2557259,3,MallyDickens,21/01/2023,"Lovely place, nice places. But the sanitary facilities announced are still not in operation. Home a little cold."
85093,2556229,4,gphil,20/01/2023,"Is a nice place, nicely laid out with lots of tasteful greenery, 300 m from the water. It would be perfect if the nicely done toilets under construction were already finished. What a pity!"

85093,2536154,4,primavera64,01/01/2023,"Nice area next to the sea to spend New Year's Eve. The bathrooms aren't finished yet, but it's not a problem for those of us that we're taking, another thing is the campers that don't have a shower... We couldn't connect to the Wi-Fi. Today the poster is full, so in summer we assume that it will be difficult to find a free place if they do not make reservations."

No sanitary facilities, but tile cutters & mortar mixers as musical accompaniment until 6:30 p.m. Space for the car with supply and disposal = 10 €. An information sheet on the door is multilingual, so the commitment for non-Spanish speakers is exhausted. She explained to me ""that's enough"", all in a way that makes me suspect that friendliness costs extra"
85093,2527871,4,Sjoberg,25/12/2022,We stayed a week in this nice place.  Work is in progress for the sanitary but we have everything in the car so it is not a problem for us.  Wi-Fi works well.

Currently, the place only costs 10 € because the sanitary is being renovated and is not available. we don't need it, because we have that on board.

85093,2522059,3,Ettedanreb,15/12/2022,"Currently no showers, no toilets, no sinks for dishes. Therefore €10 plus €3 electricity (if required). Secure area with gate. Unfortunately, there are no trash cans in the square and the lady at the reception ONLY speaks Spanish. Impossible but true! Too expensive for this service in my opinion."

Spacious plots, with shade and sun, good night lighting, the idyllic place a few steps from the beach and the town. I highlight the kindness at reception advising that we could go out in the afternoon."
85093,2475336,5,ManuelChus,31/10/2022,One of the best areas we visited for its proximity to the beautiful beach town and for the kindness of Mari Nieves who made us feel very comfortable Thank you
85093,2453293,2,traveltelly,20/10/2022,"2 night €36 (camper, 1 person incl electricity) The owners are hardly there. Many campers stand during the day in front of the gate not knowing what to do. From the 3 showers is only 1 working and it costs €1,- for 5 min. Good thing is the beach is close by."
85093,2453242,2,Formentera,20/10/2022,"Not comprehensible to give 4-5 stars. this is our third year here. In 2020/21 the place was great for 13 euros, now 18 euros and run down, a lot is broken, only one of three disgusting showers works. Toilet glasses are missing, no hot water, etc. no contact person on site, not even in English. I can no longer recommend the place."
85093,2446612,5,nuquesu,16/10/2022,"continues as always, a good area very clean and with all the services (it would need a ""repair/change of the toilets) very friendly staff. we will keep coming back, as soon as work allows us. Thank you."
85093,2439033,5,NJMC,12/10/2022,AC access is not allowed within the town. A good place to enjoy the beach. The area is very complete and clean.
85093,2438319,5,dasafru,11/10/2022,"good location, the only area in the urban core in cabo de gata and next to the beach."
85093,2434902,3,paquito,10/10/2022,"Good reception, good area but a little expensive! 15€ per pitch 1€ per shower 3€ elec, this is the price of a campsite out of season. Otherwise good, the sanitary facilities are clean but could use some updating...Very good wifi."
85093,2415436,4,Tessisworld,01/10/2022,"Parking space in a great location. The sanitary facilities are broken in a few places, but we still found the price/performance ratio to be very good. We spontaneously extended one night because we really liked the area. Arrival and departure is totally uncomplicated here. The reception is open until 7:30 p.m. If you come after that, just find a seat and pay the next day."
85093,2413379,5,Mats391,30/09/2022,"Good pitch! We paid 15 euros with 2 people and a van (without electricity, otherwise 3 euros). Sanitary facilities were clean and are now even being renewed. 3 minute walk to great beach. The small town is also worth a visit. Uncomplicated check-in, even if the reception is not manned. Not many shady spots but not a problem at the end of September. We would come again!"
85093,2407674,5,Linda303,27/09/2022,"beautiful CP, costs 15.00 per day in September for campers and 2 adults (without electricity). Only a few meters to the beautiful beach. Some nice restaurants nearby, as well as shopping. We would come back."
85093,2390810,1,lagar,21/09/2022,I called to ask about free places. I was told that they don't take reservations. I told them it's that I'm at 5 o'clock... if by when I arrive there isn't? the answer was... well don't come!
85093,2387623,4,mdtransit2020,20/09/2022,"We hesitated to go because of the bad comments from people. Finally we wanted to try it since the location seemed top to us. we were not disappointed. Nice and well kept site. the clean services, there is a Mop outside so that when we finish showering and it is full of water we can use it. It takes the same time to mop as to put a bad comment. if you need them to go behind you washing pay hotel"
85093,2376032,2,EnyaF,16/09/2022,We stayed one night and never again. Very noisy. Lots of barking dogs and owners say nothing. A pity because the site itself is quite good and well located.
85093,2355738,5,lebrivara,09/09/2022,"Second year that we return, we have spent 4 days. Despite the negative comments about cleanliness, they are not entirely true, we have checked morning and afternoon how they were cleaned. Rather, being ""dirty"" belongs to uncivil people who think that by paying, they have the right to leave it dirty and not to leave the facilities as they found it (clean). One of the best areas in the area."
85093,2340256,4,mara78,04/09/2022,"We have spent two great days, near a beautiful beach, a charming town and correct services. We will be back"
85093,2336393,5,labuenavida,03/09/2022,"Good location, near the beach and the town that is charming. Services ok, and friendly staff and with a baker in the mornings. We will return."
85093,2324063,2,adrialex,31/08/2022,"I give this assessment because the town of Agua Amarga is very beautiful, but the AREA leaves much to be desired! First the price without electricity €15 and with electricity €20 when on the web and the answering machine they are €18, the bathrooms are an Odyssey!! Of 3 showers only 1 works and the toilets don't even have a lid, apart from the fact that they are super dirty and as if that weren't enough the shower costs €1, the pitches aren't bad but without any shade."
85093,2313510,3,elch1511,28/08/2022,"Nice place, unfortunately the showers and toilets are not the best. The proximity to the beach and the small town is great, unfortunately there are many stones in the water on the beach, which make it a bit difficult to go in."
85093,2313171,2,LosPitukis,28/08/2022,"The only good thing is the proximity to the beach, just 200m. The bathrooms are not cleaned until late in the morning, there is no shade and the shower is paid separately. €15 is expensive for the service you have."
85093,2309711,2,danitabo,27/08/2022,"I was last year and it was fine. You called and they picked up the phone, although they won't let you book, at least they let you know if it's full or not. This year you call and skip an announcement that they don't reserve and that you stop by, obviously I haven't gone so as not to waste time and not make a trip in vain."
85093,2299139,5,blasjose,25/08/2022,"perfect area and above all very well located just 200 meters from the beach. Very attentive staff. emptying of dirty, showers and toilets very correct. thanks to the town hall for letting an area like this be put in place and being able to enjoy cabo de gata. I recommend it 100%"
85093,2297743,4,pedrogc,25/08/2022,"The area is very well located and has all the services of an area to spend the night. The care, as some people say, fails a bit, but it is not only the fault of the owners, but of some people who are very slutty and do not respect things. Normal price, some want to travel and have everything for free, but this is a business, not a ngo"
85093,2293032,4,SonyGasteiz,24/08/2022,Quiet and helpful area. Ideal for visiting the beaches and coves in the area. There is a lot of movement of vehicles in the early and late hours of the day.
85093,2287479,4,judithacha,22/08/2022,"Highly recommended area, near the beach and with all services, pets are allowed, coin-operated showers, power outlets are with a 3-point adapter."
85093,2270501,3,Manu1968,19/08/2022,"Area very well located... but, it is very neglected, there is no night lighting and the worst, the toilets/showers, very dirty, lack of maintenance and cleanliness, it is from a chavolista town, it is disgusting to enter them. A pity that the facilities are not maintained. They live from their situation, and this year fewer people are observed....."
85093,2253568,5,ruizk,17/08/2022,great situation a few meters from the beach of Agua amarga. showers for 1 € that should be checked because only 1 of 3 (men) worked to get a place you must go early or difficult in high season.
85093,2249720,4,PMiles,16/08/2022,"Rest area very close to the beautiful beach and the town. Very quiet at night. Pitches in the sun, but spacious and tidy. Few Spartan bathrooms, loading and unloading, washing machines. 20 € pitch with electricity, good price."
85093,2214539,3,bimbaraner,11/08/2022,For what is offered it is expensive and the facilities are mediocre. It takes advantage of being in a natural space and it is difficult to spend the night there. From reception friendly and helpful treatment but to improve the facilities.
85093,2208130,2,jesusbarrera,10/08/2022,"Compared to other areas, it is very expensive for the services it offers, the price they put does not correspond to the real price, AC electricity €20, without the right to shower, washing machine €5 and dryer €4. I suppose they take advantage because there are no nearby areas and the environment is beautiful."
85093,2205568,3,Naca-Eli,09/08/2022,Acceptable. Good ubication. It is 2 minutes from the beach. Because it is August they raise the price of electricity.
85093,2195924,5,baiasca,08/08/2022,"It's a pretty good place. Correct toilets, correct shower and the woman at the entrance is very friendly. Towards evening there is no room left. It is close to the town and the beach."
85093,2191138,5,DavidRof,07/08/2022,"We arrived at 10:30 p.m. and there was no room. The next day in the morning they let us go in to take a shower, very nice (€1 for a 5-minute shower, magnificent) and wash the pots and pans. The shower has a lot of pressure, and the washes are very, very clean and with paper. In addition, everything is decorated with very cool plants."
85093,2179531,5,virginiaher,05/08/2022,"people do not know what to complain about, there is no other place like this in the area, of course there are things that can be improved, and also the attitude and demands of many who pass through here pretending to find the services of a glamping at €15/night. .."
85093,2179194,4,Asillero11,05/08/2022,We were good. Besides that it had shade. Paid showers. Near the town to be able to visit it.
85093,2174582,1,Espasnua,04/08/2022,"We have been years ago and we love the area and the area. The last time we tried to go it was impossible, there were more than ten vehicles waiting on the street to enter. They do not make reservations and because of the treatment on the phone, they are not very interested in what you tell them. I see that as the area is easily filled, they treat us like cattle and do not worry about giving a good service."
85093,2145783,2,jorgemontero,30/07/2022,"The floor of the boys' bathroom sinks at every step, only one shower of 3 works (last year 2 of three worked) They do not allow reservations, but they do not inform you by phone of the checkin deadline... We were last year and The girl seemed to be doing you a favor by serving you. Dolo recommended if you want to spend a couple of days in the area, since there are no more places. There is something weird."
85093,2144784,4,paulamilagro,30/07/2022,"A good place to spend a night or two if you are visiting the area. Spacious and clean pitches. The good thing about it is that you can come at any time you want although the reception is from 10 to 13:30 and in the afternoon for a while. The bathrooms are neither good nor bad, they can be improved. But what is the area is quite good and very familiar. The woman at the front desk is very nice. Very pretty town."
85093,2143346,2,baroudi,29/07/2022,It's a shame.. really well located place.. but the toilets and showers are catastrophic... in the shower area there is a risk of accidents due to broken tiles! The toilet is so small.. if you close the door.. if it can be closed at all. you don't sit down anymore. Borderline for me... apparently all the money is being taken out of the company here without investing.
85093,2139325,5,RocioFondevila,29/07/2022,"All very well. The Service Quality. possibility of changing the plot once you know the advantages of one and the other. The toilets are in an acceptable state: clean in the morning because the girl who manages them does the cleaning, less throughout the day (but always acceptable) as they are used and the users do not ""do their homework"". My assessment is very positive. I recommend it."
85093,2121503,1,SUMI0405,25/07/2022,"The bathrooms are dirty and the smell that comes from the garbage containers that are all in the town in front of the area, make it not recommended, also there is no shade."
85093,2108120,1,annie33150,22/07/2022,No unwelcoming staff makes you not want to stay I returned in view of the friendliness I came out directly I do not recommend
85093,2104154,4,Icamon,21/07/2022,"A great place to spend the night near the beach. It was full when we arrived and we had to go somewhere else to spend the night. Anyway, we had a 5 minute shower for a euro."
85093,2042204,5,mmanu28,06/07/2022,"We spent 2 nights at the end of June, we liked the area, very quiet and next to the beach. We arrived outside office hours, we entered and parked in a free space and the next morning with the reception open we made the payment, by the way very friendly and everything was perfect. Showers €1 5 minutes, cleaning could be improved, also by users."
85093,2041831,1,dennbpcamper,05/07/2022,"The paid toilets could already be a bit cleaner. eye price is not for 24 hours we enter late-night and at 12 noon the next day a girl calls and then kicks in the butt, with the explanation that their policy is like hotels ..... that's scamming or explaining it to the check in... really bad. 0 stars. If I return it is by remote chance."
85093,2035630,4,Corterueda,03/07/2022,Good area to visit Agua Amarga and surroundings. Now in July and August it is usually full.
85093,2033868,5,alain1979,03/07/2022,"Very good area in a beautiful town. Beach 3 minutes. Correct size seats. Cannot be reserved. Very clean water filling and emptying area. There are sinks. Garbage and recycling area just outside the area. Very friendly staff, very quiet place. Well leveled. There are showers, I didn't use them. Very good site!"
85093,2031682,4,sonotem,02/07/2022,"Good location very close to the beach. Very attentive staff. It is not possible to reserve, so it is a negative point. The toilet area is not attended. current and plot ok."
85093,2029723,4,merx1978,02/07/2022,"the attention very good as always, the only thing we have seen this year, that the bathrooms are fatal and the showers of 4 that there are, two did not work, the hot water ran out right away, many people and few services, otherwise all good."
85093,2029021,1,joselito33,02/07/2022,"We have been disappointed, the bathrooms work with euro coins and are very neglected, the bathroom floors are broken, two of the three showers do not work, the hot water runs out very quickly, there is no maintenance, they could reinvest the money and watch the clientele."
85093,2028079,4,HuhnundAuto,01/07/2022,"Nice owners, good places, uncomplicated, close to the beach. Showers in 5 minutes absolutely doable for us. unfortunately garbage container opposite, therefore some flies. Is probably new, because the operators can do nothing about it."
85093,2015740,4,alfrodobolson,27/06/2022,"Nice area very close to the town of Agua Amarga. €15 per stay, electricity has risen to €5 instead of the €3 that other colleagues paid. The spacious plots, you can take out awning and chairs. The plots furthest to the right are directly opposite a huge row of dumpsters, separated only by the hedges that demarcate the area. Washing machine €5 and dryer €4."
85093,2008744,3,sey,25/06/2022,"This is the second time we are on this site. Last year we liked the area and the town so much that we decided to repeat it. But note that the care and cleanliness of the bathrooms in the area is nothing to see, this year quite dirty."
85093,1983647,5,frederic1967,16/06/2022,a very beautiful area close to the beach 200 meters and a very beautiful little village only black point but it becomes customary if you want to shower on the area it is a shame because at 18 euros with electricity it could be included
85093,1977633,5,Karlchen_Camper,14/06/2022,"Stood here for one night and felt very comfortable. All in all (shower & electricity extra, plus washing clothes) certainly not that cheap, but still all good. The proximity to the beach in a beautiful bay is great and the lady at reception (speaks German) is super nice. thanks!"
85093,1976724,4,gimenells,14/06/2022,The area is fine and the town is very pretty. The plots are spacious and it is quiet. The beach is super close. I don't give it a 5 because there is a lack of hygiene and care in the bathrooms.
85093,1963121,5,Spinbikes,10/06/2022,"Camper area at the entrance of Agua Amarga, next to the beach. €15 per night with loading and unloading and Wi-Fi. Wide and level plots, calm and quiet area at night. Somewhat small toilets, showers at €1/5 minutes. 10 minutes from the parking lot of Playa de los Muertos."
85093,1959722,5,campiquipugui,08/06/2022,"Highly recommended! 2min walk from the beach and 15min drive from the ""playa de los muertos"" Large plots and very quiet! With bread service at 10:00. I would definitely go back!"
85093,1957524,4,rbn_88,07/06/2022,"very good, we put a 4 because if you measure more than 1.80 in the toilet you will be tight at that time of day. large plots the rest all good, no shade. We traveled with a small van"
85093,1955280,4,Relyat,07/06/2022,"Two minute walk to the beach and town.
Gravel pitches, reasonably sized.
Showers, toilets, dishwashing could do with improving.
Road is close so there is noise, but not much traffic and none overnight."
85093,1908812,5,sergitarres,22/05/2022,"Super recommended !!! We spent two nights, loading, unloading and chemical toilet € 30 (15 per day). There was plenty of room (mid-May)"
85093,1899847,5,FranAlva,19/05/2022,"The area deserves a 5, clean, well-kept, close to the town and the beach. To put a but… the showers last 5 minutes with one euro (the sign says 7 minutes…) and it starts counting from the moment you put a coin in, not from the moment you turn on the tap… otherwise, everything is fine."
85093,1892594,3,UteMeike,15/05/2022,"The place is very close to the beach and the road, quiet at night. The area is nice, a small place with hiking possibilities. The place is pleasant when relatively empty, unpleasant when full. Parking bays, no shade. Shower 5 minutes for 1 euro, be careful, after that no more water runs, not even the cold one! Cold dishwater. Reception only sporadically manned."
85093,1867261,1,ElenaRodriNegri,03/05/2022,The area is very small. On our arrival nobody at the reception. We took the opportunity to take a shower (the bathrooms are tiny and in very poor maintenance and hygiene conditions). We prefer to spend the night in another place so just as we entered we left.
85093,1860263,1,AntonioVal,29/04/2022,area 15 e. it is too expensive for the services it has except the water change you have to pay for the rest
85093,1857337,3,Morizet,28/04/2022,"18 euros, location electricity is expensive for the service given. Paid shower, sink for the dishes not practical and garbage cans in the village. no hot water in the sink. Too bad, otherwise nice and quiet place."
85093,1854815,5,FifersonTour,26/04/2022,Stopped for one night stayed for six nights. Great stop over really quiet and village is so sleepy but beautiful. La Hoya cafe / bar just two minutes from the aire has excellent coffee and tostada in the morning.
85093,1836404,4,meadman,18/04/2022,"Nice site. Close to restaurants and shops. Toilets/ showers tight  spaces but clean. Site was nicely presented, slightly tight spaced but acceptable.
Get there early as high turn around as site is close to the beach."
85093,1834431,3,izas1976,18/04/2022,Good location and quiet night. Cold shower water and toilets could be cleaner.
85093,1831074,2,tonylozanomusic,17/04/2022,"The area is not bad, the problem is that being so close to the beach and there are so many people wanting to enter, several problems arise, the cleaning of the bathrooms is minimal, the bathrooms run out of toilet paper and at noon they are already all dirty full of scratches and fatal, not to mention the space that I have seen vans with a larger bathroom, go that you sit with the door in front, the showers are very poorly organized, 3 showers, at 1 euro 5 minutes that is what is normal, what is not normal is that by mid-afternoon there is no more hot water, in fact I had to take a cold shower, and where you put the coin is outside the shower so you have to go out and come in naked with the other people there showering inside the shower there are no shelves for shower utensils and much less there is a changing table to change clothes, it is a very nice area but very poorly organized, otherwise the night is fine and without noise and the people very respectful"
85093,1825318,3,abardina,15/04/2022,"They take advantage of the few options to sleep in the area. We were lucky and found a place, it filled up quickly. The truth is that it is exploited but we slept peacefully and we were able to get chairs and tables, which is what we wanted."
85093,1824255,4,MaRu2014,15/04/2022,"Very nice site. Friendly staff, very well priced, clean toilets. Wide areas. Near the town and the beach. We will be back."
85093,1823575,1,windalo,15/04/2022,"I've been coming since they opened, but the situation has gotten worse. It is not possible to reserve and when you arrive it is always full because now they allow caravans, vans without campers to stay overnight. I've seen SUVs, Citroën Berlingo sleeping in the trunk… it looks like a campsite. Above the open door at night, I was able to walk in the dark between vehicles without being a user."
85093,1819325,1,icobo,13/04/2022,"They don't pick up the phone, when you get there in a very bad way they tell you that it's full. A little more education costs nothing. We never plan to go back."
85093,1819268,2,alissagio,13/04/2022,"NO garbage cans! You should dispose of it in the village! Cold showers for men - generally you have to pay for showers, despite the moderate price. WiFi works very badly - often only in the afternoon when the campers are out and therefore there are few people at the CP. The ladies are often grumpy and only there for 2H each, so if you have any questions you have to wait until the next day. The gate is always open to strangers..."

85093,1789234,4,Jolisa,20/03/2022,9-3-22. We arrived late afternoon and they still had room. For this place you have to get off the highway for a while and then back again. You have 4 showers in a row with a shared changing room. Not much room to put your stuff. With a shower curtain you prevent the people who walk past the toilet building from not seeing you change ... could have been better. Check out is 12:00 but we were allowed to go a little later.
85093,1779878,4,Leslobs3,11/03/2022,"Area a little expensive: 15€/day with electricity, not including the showers... but close to the beach, the town center and the hiking trails. Pretty village, pretty setting, we will be back."
85093,1770199,4,san19982,01/03/2022,"The area is quite good, you pay what you want to use more, (shower, electricity, washing machine...), quiet place near the beach and the town. The baker passes at 10 so you have daily bread. There are several routes to do nearby. The only thing I miss is someone at the reception, who controls and transmits security of who enters and leaves and thus close the entrance door since they are always open."
85093,1766294,5,europa-kontour.ch,26/02/2022,"Great place, we were there early and were lucky enough to grab 1st place (large forecourt). Do not accept reservations (mail remains unanswered, go anyway). Everything is available what you need, nice little place, beautiful hikes possible."
85093,1764256,4,JackKhousto,23/02/2022,"Well located, fairly spacious pitches, pleasant welcome but: - deplorable wifi signal - 3 washing machines, not industrial, for one drying machine only and this one inefficient."

You pay for everything else, you pay for electricity, you pay for the shower. But the crowning glory is the washing machine which costs € 5 (and another 4 to dry). Also thank the management who will have agreed on the barrier at 2 meters in the large parking lot in front. The town: a desert"

85093,1720228,5,ix1and2s,30/12/2021,"Good area, well located, very close to the sea. € 12 without electricity. Clean bathrooms and large, level pitches. The shower is € 1 and you have 7 minutes of water, plenty to take a good shower. Very good filling and emptying area, with area for washing clothes and sinks. By sunset it was complete. The baker has spent around 10 in the morning selling bread and pastries, great !!!"
85093,1717153,3,brunoalexander,27/12/2021,"The location is good, the beach is about 300 meters away. The sanitary facilities were dirty and outdated during our stay. The toilet doors cannot be closed. At our parking space it smelled disgusting of piss. Lots of wild cats roaming free. It was okay for an overnight stay."
85093,1716182,1,EUSEBIO30653,26/12/2021,deplorable welcome .. no possible abuse if you do not stay the night! and we make it clear to you without politeness !! luckily I found a little corner of paradise 25min away so thank you to them hehe

85093,1713316,4,Type,20/12/2021,Nice place ... nothing to complain about the price-performance ratio. Unfortunately not much was open in the village. But it's just off-season. The owner is German. A very nice person;)
85093,1710529,4,DaniMarco,15/12/2021,"Quiet camper area in December, we stayed two nights at 15 euros per night including electricity, hot showers 1 euro, clean sanitary facilities, good a / c system. Possibility of trekking in the area. There are many hungry kittens, if you love animals give them something to eat please! ;)"
85093,1710470,4,aivanyoe,15/12/2021,"The area is well set up and close to the beach, in summer it has to be full, on these dates few people, about 10AC, I have been comfortable, what I did not like is the little time of the reception staff that is in the area and there are no garbage containers, you have to go to the village, otherwise fine."

85093,1706646,3,dermhurl,08/12/2021,"very well located next to the beach, with all the necessary services. In some areas of the town motorhomes are not allowed. They gave us square 15 next to the sewage drain, although there were still empty squares. We asked them to change at least to eat and they would not let us."
85093,1693620,3,pacoortiz,20/11/2021,"Very well located space, all foreign clients except us. Quiet atmosphere. It can be improved by placing some light at night and putting more care and cleaning in the toilets. Great staff treatment. We will repeat."
85093,1693425,2,kristinaEH,19/11/2021,"The price for the services you have is excessive. The toilets without paper, and that there were not many people, and without reception staff. Only an hour and a half in the morning and two in the afternoon. They also did not take advantage of that time to clean the toilets. € 12 and shower at € 1"
85093,1690630,3,tabrox22,16/11/2021,"Dont stay close to serivce piont, we had milion flies and bad smell. Wifi isnt great. Bathrooms overall clean. For shower u have to pay extra. There are some cats Here, Please take care of them, they were thristy."

And a lot of AC we had to leave and find our lives. Knowing in advance about the bridge and do not take advantage to have its capacity to 100% as in the summer. We were inside and about 8 AC could fit more. I am not coming back."
85093,1637479,5,kastanyas88,10/10/2021,Very complete area. If it touches you in the part of the mountain there is shade but not. But the truth is very close to the beach and very clean facilities. € 15 with supplies 1 euro 5 minutes shower

85093,1624924,4,MariClaire,03/10/2021,"A great area. Right next to the exit of the route towards cala de en medio. A detail that if you enter in the afternoon they will let you out at 5:00 p.m. the next day. They don't make reservations, which is worse when planning. Overall good area."
85093,1609825,5,aorts,26/09/2021,"Great place, all services and a good atmosphere. with a small van with a roof tent, and two people, 12 euros per night. The shower costs € 1 5 minutes, it has wifi. We will repeat."

When you get out of the shower the space is shared with others ..., there is little privacy. I understand that the price is because it is 300m from the beach and very close to Playa de los Muertos. Despite that everything is clean and working, very friendly and helpful staff. Few shadows."
85093,1596918,4,brujillavan,21/09/2021,Showers cost € 1 5mn and € 2 10mn. great place and in the center.
85093,1584372,3,alexgari,16/09/2021,"€ 18 / night one AC and two people with electricity, perfect for visiting the town and the area. Without shade, on hot days it is better to go to the beach which is 200m away. Basic toilets and showers. More sites like this are needed! Bravo!!!"
85093,1583474,4,Seila1985,16/09/2021,"Although the price may seem a bit high, the place is located 300 meters from the beach, the facilities are clean and cared for and it is easily accessible for any type of vehicle. We spent one night on the way to San Jose and we were very comfortable. As a downside it is near a road and there is noise."
85093,1570095,5,lebrivara,12/09/2021,"We have just spent our second night, and we are super comfortable, the owner is very friendly, make them spacious, it would take a little more shade. But otherwise all services at hand. The toilets are clean, the beach is 2 min walk away, quiet at night. We will certainly repeat. Nothing according to the last comment."
85093,1569128,2,catdesienne,11/09/2021,"20 euros a night on September 11, very excessive. Dilapidated sanitary facilities. Downstairs spaces facing the car park zero, dust, absolutely no shade and no noise. Garbage trucks for 1 hour, cars coming and going, tractor cleaning the beach in the morning. Only the top places under the cliff can earn this award. We will not be returning."

85093,1563077,3,AET66,09/09/2021,"We have spent the night of September 8 to 9. Apart from the dust and little shade, the area very well. The negative, we had as neighbors three families from Malaga who met while parking and until 12 at night I had to give them the touch, there was no way to sleep or be calm! There are people who do not understand civic norms !! We would repeat for the area and services in the area."
85093,1559095,5,RobertoPE,08/09/2021,Beachside area with all services. We stayed two nights and great. The path to Cala de Enmedio starts from the same door and we have gone two days. In the middle of September and at six in the afternoon I already had the full poster.

85093,1555008,5,axarmango,07/09/2021,"We were on Saturday, September 4, it is close to the town, everything very close. Very friendly treatment of the lady in charge, clean services and with anti-covid standards and for our part, it was a good idea to pay € 1 for the shower so it does not pampline and it takes less time. We will repeat without a doubt."
85093,1549813,5,McBacon66,05/09/2021,Nice spot in a little village by the sea. Will be shaded and than even more perfect!

85093,1521617,3,monfermat,28/08/2021,"The location is perfect !!! But it is a dry land, not a shadow (and in Almería it is necessary) ... it takes time for the trees to grow."
85093,1515595,2,ilundu,26/08/2021,"The area is very good, but the area is so crowded that it is difficult to find a place ... They do not make reservations and do not answer the phone or to know if they have a space or not. In the town you can not circulate in AC, very narrow streets."
85093,1509671,4,GodinoCamper,25/08/2021,"Correct area, with everything you need, decent size squares, that is without shadows, for covid reasons the showers are 1 in 1. You can be waiting about 30 minutes at the door for your shower shift. Otherwise everything is fine, rest is respected and close to the town and beach. We will repeat if we have the opportunity. On these dates it is always full, get up early to get a place."
85093,1508773,1,juliplaza74,24/08/2021,"Yesterday, Monday at the end of August, we arrived at noon and everything was complete, the answering machine was on the phone and there was no one at the door, in the town it was not even possible to circulate, the star is not in the area, that sure is fine, It is because of the crowdedness of the area. If you can, do not go until well into September or with a reservation and confirmed!"
85093,1468030,5,LaNenita,16/08/2021,"Clean, delimited pitches, all the services you may need for a motorhome and next to the beach and the town. Also super quiet and ideal for hiking."

85093,1436777,1,Mas518,10/08/2021,Until 17:00 they do not know if the establishment is empty or full.
85093,1435121,4,andreaema,10/08/2021,"We stood in line outside for hours, we went in to ask questions and the treatment by the one who takes it was horrible, it is as if it bothered him that people go to ask and insist. Once we entered, the treatment changed completely, a correct and kind woman. Even if it is completely out and they tell you that there is no place, ignore it, there is a lot of movement so stay and insist."
85093,1433690,1,MariangelesAmado,10/08/2021,"Edge not the following !!! We already know that they are left over, but the woman could be a little kinder."
85093,1433507,4,inovell,10/08/2021,"We have entered to empty waters and very well, ample space. Likewise, the services were also very clean. For us, the treatment of the management has been correct and pleasant. I guess since the capacity this morning was full to spend the night, that's why there were people killing time, waiting outside"
85093,1428107,1,jlmorsan72,09/08/2021,"I do not know where to start ... the management is unfortunate, it is an odyssey to be able to enter since they do not reserve and there are a lot of motorhomes waiting (with how easy it would be to pay your reservation) .After hours of waiting, you manage to enter and they receive you Miss Sympathy ... Otherwise, the facilities are good and clean, although there is no shade at all and the floor leaves much to be desired."
85093,1417768,3,andrea1302,07/08/2021,"The management of the entrance is a shame ... they do not reserve and they do not make things easier, we were waiting 2h30 min to get a place that also nobody assured us ... they do not know how many people are leaving in the day ... even so, just outside there is a Galibo parking and another next to where you can spend the night without problem. The park is very good, in a sunny but with space to take out an awning, and there is a breeze."
85093,1414318,1,Insanmar,06/08/2021,"They do not reserve, nor do they answer when you call to know if they have free places and when you arrive everything is complete and they tell you to wait at the door to see if someone comes out throughout the day and at the door all full of AC waiting. I understand that they are left over, but it costs nothing to be a little kinder and make things easier."
85093,1411363,1,luchinio,06/08/2021,"Very poorly managed, unpleasant and pushy. A little empathy towards others would go bad for us. The man's comment says it all, 'as I have it full I don't care' ... well ... you don't deserve it !!!"
85093,1405211,1,fernandoalonso,04/08/2021,"The entrance management is a shame, if you call you get a voice-over telling you the time of the possible entrance and they do not tell you how it is available and when you arrive it is full, and I tried to go several times and you always find the same problem, here I will not try again."
85093,1396975,1,zanpantzar,03/08/2021,"Bad management, unpleasant treatment. We called the day before and an answering machine told us that reservations are made from 10:00 to 13:00. We have appeared at 11:30 and we have found a sign at the entrance where it said that it was full until 17:00, without giving the option to ask. At 4:30 p.m. we have returned and the comoleto poster was hanging until tomorrow. We have not been the only ones."
85093,1385615,5,famdamgo,31/07/2021,Super well located and well managed area the town is charming and the beach is very good perfect to visit Playa de los Muertos
85093,1377221,4,alinoa,29/07/2021,"They don't make reservations but you have to be vigilant because there is a lot of movement in and out. Reservations only one week and one month in advance in high season. It is a good place, close to the beach, hot but quite breezy. Very nice little town and places to eat. Essential awning to cover yourself from the sun and heat. Nice people. It is a place to repeat."

85093,1358853,4,txiki1026,24/07/2021,"A good place to visit the bitter water beach and its surrounding coves. It has all kinds of services and the price did not seem excessively expensive. We stayed there for two nights but we had to spend the first in the small esplanade outside (no fines and we were very quiet too) since when we arrived it was full. The next morning, around 10 a.m. we managed to enter."
85093,1356965,5,Javicamo,24/07/2021,Great location and acceptable prices. Very close to Amarga beach and ideal for a route to the beach of the dead. The services are very good and the owner is always attentive. You have to go early because it fills up fast. Recommendable.
85093,1355071,3,Asi13,23/07/2021,"It's fine to spend a few days, but you have to go early to get a place. We found it very cheap to have to pay € 1 for a 5 minute shower, plus time runs even if you don't have the tap running ... my partner had to go out with the soap on his head. near the beach and recommended to go for a walk to the beach of the dead (3km)."
85093,1349497,4,MikiOlot,22/07/2021,Very good camper area. Many days it is complete. Little shadow!

The first night was complete because we arrived at night and slept in the village a little higher up, very quiet. € 15 and € 3 more if you contract electricity."
85093,1305069,5,Carlikun,08/07/2021,Extraordinary area of Motorhomes. 18euros (3 people and electricity) First line of the beach and near the town walking 5 minutes. Very good attention. Easy access. Note: at 6pm in the afternoon they had already hung up the entire poster. They do not reserve. We entered in July in the morning without problem Totally recommended
85093,1303016,5,DaniItineo,07/07/2021,Good place to spend a few days. One step away from the beach and 40 min walk from the Enmedio cove. It is worth stopping by.
85093,1299850,5,sey,05/07/2021,Perfect area to spend a few days. Central to visit the town that is very beautiful and visit the nearby beaches.

85093,1285934,3,josemileo,29/06/2021,"Quiet and correct area, there are no streetlights, when it gets dark, there is no trash can, unclean toilets because of the unclean, there is a lack of a mop for those who come out of the shower to use it or give them a manual on how to use it, this close to the 3mn beach, pitches without shade, basic services, restaurants are not cheap like ice cream parlors that must bring them from Norway for the price"

85093,1276280,5,Autosusmabe,25/06/2021,Ideal area. Everything very clean and taken care of. Next to the beach and the town of Agua Amarga… In theory we were going to stay only one night and we have stayed two. Large and comfortable seats. (For showers 1 euro 5 min).
85093,1271454,5,sergio142,23/06/2021,We just went to fill and empty. € 5. The site next to the beach. Pleasant. It can be filled and emptied without problem comfortably. It is worth not wandering around looking for a source. There were quite a few AC and Camper. Some shade. 2 people sleep with filling and emptying costs € 15
85093,1270073,4,AUTOCARAVIAJAND,22/06/2021,Good clean area and close to the beach I do not give it 5 stars since it is supposed that quiet hours are from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and until 12 at night a group of children playing and running throughout the Area until 12 and nobody the reception tells them nothing ... We go with 3 children too and they could not sleep from the fuss they made .... A little expensive for a large family € 20 with light. But close to the beach
85093,1267312,5,KurtUngersbaek,20/06/2021,"Great place, with very nice operators who ensure a great, nice and quiet atmosphere. We have already renewed three times because we liked it so much."

85093,1239588,4,JaviImbernon,06/06/2021,"Located on the beach, it has all the services and large and level plots. Little shade and the toilets a bit neglected. Otherwise, a highly recommended place to spend a couple of nights on the beach. A visit to the town's ice cream parlors and an excursion to Cala de Enmedio are recommended."

We have eaten at the Agua Amarga Restaurant and it is fabulous, the seafood rice of 10. Do not forget to buy your own oil, it is wonderful to eat raw. First time we were in this area and we will be back for sure"

I do not recommend it, dirty and very unpleasant by the lady who runs it"
85093,1224695,4,Urkrass,29/05/2021,"Very well located and organized. One of the few places where Corona is taken seriously. We cannot understand the complaints about the ""German couple at the entrance"". They are officially the site attendants and receptionists and have to keep things tidy in such a busy place ... They were nice to us."
85093,1217495,4,Wilmhobby,25/05/2021,Nice place close to the beach. Total price for the pitch size a bit high with electricity 15 euros

85093,1211121,5,Gabor1979,22/05/2021,"The location of the camperpark is unbeatable, Agua Amarga is a charming town with a beautiful beach and a good atmosphere. The area is a few meters from the beach and is a perfect place to relax. The German lady who welcomed us was very nice. Bathrooms, shower, everything clean and well maintained. We stayed 5 nights, we will be back!"
85093,1210667,5,19871987,22/05/2021,"A perfect Camper Area, a magnificent treatment and a spectacular setting, in short, a corner of Cabo de Gata not to forget and to return."

85093,1180602,5,karinchristian,27/04/2021,"very lovingly made place. Actually a dream place. Thank you Nijar Municipality. Not only put up prohibition signs, but also offer alternatives. Space is generous, including wide spaces for very large motorhomes. Operator very nice and also the German lady who lives there very friendly."
85093,1178322,3,nofrills,23/04/2021,Super nice place to go on a beach holiday and hikes to the next bays. The place owner is friendly and the price-performance ratio ok. But Germans live directly at the reception in their mobile homes who act as if the place belongs to them. They are very unfriendly and sometimes abuse the guests. The operator should throw these people off the site to create a peaceful atmosphere.
85093,1160914,5,Frankia84400,30/03/2021,"Super Aire, clean all services, accessible to all sizes, including towed. Manuel welcomes us very warmly. The village is typical with a magnificent view"

85093,1139139,2,Montauk55,19/02/2021,"Nice place with sights, hiking, beach, the place is okay, if the couple at the reception were still friendly and competent, so because of wearing a mask, they are like spit dogs, they have no manners. The owner comes by every evening and makes the registrations. Shame for the place. Would be nice."
85093,1136077,5,monicap94,08/02/2021,"Beautiful area, quite and very well maintained. Showers cost 1€ for 5 minutes, very clean and new. Great welcome from the owner. Beautiful little village!"

85093,1125271,4,Guarma,29/12/2020,"Clean, quiet, spacious, comfortable area, friendly staff ... Maybe in summer there is a lack of shade.Our first overnight stay in an area.We called before and when we arrived the boy was there (because of the Covid there is no one at reception). several bike and hiking routes. Nice beaches and good places to eat (Bar Guarimón). We will definitely return"
85093,1124363,5,digitaldesignnomad,27/12/2020,"Great space and very friendly staff. You can see in detail that love has been put into the pitch. The village is also very worth seeing. It's a shame that we couldn't go to the beach with our dog, so we left the next day. We ate paella at the Ole Ajo restaurant - very tasty. Small note on the pitch: Unfortunately, after flushing in the designated basin, there is no disposal for leftover food. But still highly recommended."
85093,1119696,5,sammatiakiles,06/12/2020,"All perfect. We called ahead to see if it was open and the guy came down in 5 minutes, he was already there before us. Next to the small town of Aguamarga, next to the beach. It is true that there is no shade but in winter it does not matter a bit, in summer I imagine that it is impossible to be."
85093,1113434,1,GillesArlette,08/11/2020,"The place is beautiful and the town charming. The negatives are the two managers who are rude and rude to some customers. But the worst part is the owner's father, who takes himself as the king of the people and is imbued with himself. He does not know how to say hello or thank."
85093,1112906,2,Tschero,06/11/2020,We stayed one nigth and we will not come back (the owner is not nice at all -2 stars and the place itself is not really nice -1 star). toilets and safety seemed ok.

85093,1100284,5,alvaromenawer,20/10/2020,"Large pitches, between 2:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. they do not attend but they open you up so you can settle in and check in later. The WiFi is regular and the service is good. Clean bathrooms, correct anti-covid protocol. They charge you for the shower but the water filling and emptying service is included, so we opted to shower in the motorhome. We stayed 2 nights and the truth was, very comfortable."
85093,1096150,5,nuquesu,17/10/2020,"Area in perfect condition, clean and correct services. spacious plots with all services, fair wifi, correct treatment. we will be back."
85093,1081147,3,ruanoy,04/10/2020,Very close to the beach. The owner is unfriendly ... stall bathrooms and showers for € 1 5min. We asked for an adapter for the light and he told us that he would not let us know that he would sell it for € 20
85093,1079896,2,afdeudero,03/10/2020,"Very dirty bathrooms, zero hygiene measures. The very unpleasant owner who has no interest in properly serving customers. We have been to other areas in the area and all are much better than it is."
85093,1065565,1,bert21,23/09/2020,"I do not give less punctuation because they do not let me. The owner was very rude and unpleasant, we paid for an electricity service, we blew the fuses and the lady did nothing to solve the problem and on top of that she answered in a bad way. When you enter they do not explain any rules to you but that if they want you to comply with them all but in front of everyone they start to beat you up. They told us that we had a shower but that if we wanted hot water it was € 1 5min and it turns out that when I went to shower the euro was both for hot and cold, otherwise you pay, you do not shower. Not to mention the cleanliness of them very dirty and run down. Next to reception a machine for coke cans but it is useless because it is broken. In my parking space a horror, that looked like the jungle, between a lot of cats and an inordinate amount of insects, the night became a horror. If you can find another place to sleep better."
85093,1065551,1,JMP23,23/09/2020,"The service of grief, the woman who works there has very bad manners and has no education, at the end of the day we told her that we are not satisfied with the service and that we were going to publish it and her reply was “I don't care, I don't care. comments do not affect me at all ”excuse me? you are a scoundrel lady. If you don't know how to work for a public, stay at home and don't go out. On the other hand, the bathrooms ... Some spiders that looked like spiderman, oh my ... Also when we called to ask for information they told us a price and then when we got there it was another ... You have to be careful with that too. There were many many cats, I say this for people who do not like cats or are allergic ... I will not repeat there or given away."
85093,1060213,5,gemmaixavi,20/09/2020,"Good area. Quiet. The very correct owner, is going around there. The correct bathrooms. Very clean and well prepared water replacement service. We do not shower there, since the water is included in the € 12 (without electricity), and for showering it works with € 1 coins, so we opted to shower in the van and change water. We entered with two dogs, of which we paid nothing. Without a doubt to repeat. One cons: there is a lot of humidity, there is a beach and a good laugh next door."
85093,1054243,5,alex2332,17/09/2020,"Good area, spacious pitches and everything clean. Showers are charged at € 1 5 minutes. Very close to the beach. It is filled to the brim with AC and campers. The only annoyance was neighborhood lad dogs howling at night."

85093,1035445,5,currante,08/09/2020,"Good area 2 minutes walk to the beach. Good facilities but no shade. It is not reserved, so you have to be aware of the departures, and it is usually full until September 15. Perhaps this point would be to improve. The phone refers you to wats or mail. To wats, they respond quickly"
85093,1034872,4,pablo1996,08/09/2020,"Incredible location just 1 minute from the sand of the beach, clean showers, for putting some bad phone attention because they don't get it when you call and the owner is quite unfriendly."
85093,1033658,5,solrrak,08/09/2020,"One of the best areas I have seen, better than some campsites. There is no shade as in almost all of Cabo de Gata. Smokers please stop throwing their cigarette butts everywhere, here the ground is gravel and it is impossible to collect them."
85093,1032078,4,CrisyDavid,07/09/2020,Good area in the same town and next to the beach. Very aware of the Covid issue. The only but is that it has no shadows and by day it is impossible to be there.

85093,1011703,4,josemialbi,29/08/2020,Good area there is no shade at all but it is very close to the beach. From the very entrance to the area there is a path that takes you to the cove in the middle that is a real pass! highly recommended we have spent 4 nights
85093,1005789,3,KUN71,27/08/2020,"Good area, although practically no shade. Attached to the people. You have to arrive first thing in the morning because it fills up right away. We spoke to a client who had paid for three nights, but had to go. He spoke with the manager and agreed to give them to us, with which we spent three free nights with electricity included."
85093,1002929,4,luisabino,26/08/2020,Location within the motorhome with 7.5m without problems. with beach very close. very clean.
85093,1001990,1,MirianBB,25/08/2020,I try to shame they do not pick up the phone right at the door of the area there is a huge parking lot where you can park motorhomes and a little later another for cars two minutes from the beach for free and where you can spend the night.
85093,993173,5,dani3lin,22/08/2020,"Very good area, the person in charge very attentive at all times that the measures against Covid19 are fulfilled. Everything very clean.

85093,984665,4,Merky,20/08/2020,"The motorhome area is very good, the owner or manager is a friendly lady and the areas within the complex are clean. The beach is very close, but nothing pretty, full of stones, better to use construction boots with steel soles to enter. But some people comment that walking for about thirty minutes there is another very good beach, although we could not visit it."
85093,974192,2,isabellopezperez,17/08/2020,They do not answer the phone and on top of the recording they tell you that they do not make reservations and then you will wait for cars with reservation to be available and enter. How do you eat it?
85093,967989,5,Jflidaz,16/08/2020,"Good area, close to the beach and clean. The only thing if you are going to use electricity, you have to bring your cetac plug, Spanish is not worth it. I charge € 20 for the plug"

Some very good covid-19 measures with the owner in the lead making them comply and disinfected constantly. the only but is that the shade is scarce."
85093,890202,5,Lumiadv,22/07/2020,"A nice place, well located and close to the beach. Agua Amarga is a neighborhood in Nijar and a vehicle is necessary to move around the area. Very good anti Covid measures."

85093,881367,4,patryhergo,19/07/2020,"Good place to spend the night, with all services, and very well located. I do not give it 5 stars because the plots are somewhat fair and because for € 12 the shower could be included (€ 1 for 5 min.- € 2 10 min). It is worth taking a tour of the town of Agua Amarga."
85093,879407,5,elsoplagaitas,18/07/2020,Place with all services and just a stone's throw from the beach. We have returned 3 years later and they have renovated sinks and showers.

85093,846187,4,Drugo,03/07/2020,"The place is very well located, 3 minutes from the beach and the town, the plots are well leveled, the shade still awning is complicated by the low position of the sun and the orientation of the plot. During our stay the parking lot was full, and due to anticovid measures only one person could use each bathroom, which greatly saturated the service. In general, it is quite good and complete."
85093,840487,4,nonohuercal,28/06/2020,We stayed two nights 06/25/2020 to 27 good plots and for 15 euros a day you have toilets light load discharge and water shower 1 euro good place somewhat expensive to not have shadows

85093,749916,4,wayopa,04/12/2019,"Area more than correct. The lowest number places are next to the road. At night it is not annoying because there is little traffic, but during the day the noise of the vehicles is heard when passing"
85093,746776,5,enrouelibre,24/11/2019,"Very nice and functional area in a charming little village (a little dead in early November, but a bar on the beach saves the day, especially as dogs are welcome, a miracle in Spain!)"

Practical: There are many ways to hang washed clothes (clothes line, pull-out clothes rails on the wall near the washbasins, mobile drying racks, although very rickety; )"
85093,740585,2,mm-bs,09/11/2019,"For 17 euros incl electricity and showers you can go to a campsite with ACSI. 12 Euro only for standing is not appropriate for this lonely area. Clean place, friendly reception but overall too expensive."
85093,739590,2,Adrift,07/11/2019,Lovely location but the lady running the place gave us a cold welcome and was mis informative about restaurants we were told that the restaurants didn’t open until much later so we were pleasantly surprised to find the beach side restaurant open at 16.00 and serving a nice menu del dia. Went for a shower in the morning having been told by the the same lady that the paid for showers were hot but were in fact distinctly cold!! For €12 without hook up the pitches were very narrow.

Enter the water loaded and discharged from WC.Parcelas large and very quiet night. To repeat without a doubt!"
85093,718558,5,zazufranchefi,11/10/2019,"All right. Cleanliness, attention, service and perfect care. Too bad the town needs a little cleaning in its streets and garbage containers. Many flies."

85093,685142,4,ignaaratos,10/09/2019,"We just went to empty and load. For five euros first thing in the morning they have it well assembled (there are two ACs at the same time downloading) and it is done fast. Next to the beach and the town that is very worthwhile. To take the day, we parked in the open field in front of which, although it is prohibited, a villager told us that you can even spend the night. We day without problem."

85093,682541,2,fali1134,09/09/2019,"The site is normal, I can understand the price of 12 euros x the location near the beach, but that kk charges you showers separately .... I think very miserable could learn x at least as the camper park of € 10 olive groves with all services included."

85093,666275,3,veroialbert,29/08/2019,We have been one night. Washbasins and showers very clean. The showers are worth € 1 for 5 minutes. Overnight € 12. The only problem of the place is that it is a very tourist area and silence at night in the regulations is not a priority (other areas at 12 ask for absolute silence). It is also a town with few services and is a bit far from the entire natural park of Cabo de Gata.
85093,659441,5,therryT41,25/08/2019,"5 stars deserved! Very good reception, well defined and comfortable places, very neat, clean services and showers, in the morning you can buy bread on the spot. Beach and shops a few hundred meters away. Very comfortable and clean CS area."
85093,654825,4,rubencaravana,23/08/2019,"A wonderful place to spend a few quiet days and near the beach, with a very friendly treatment by the staff"
85093,653476,3,Sielenaid,23/08/2019,"Area near the beach, with the necessary. Slightly small plots, very helpful staff."
85093,648675,4,zukitruki,21/08/2019,"The place to go to the beach is excellent, it is next to the area although it has some stones, the place is very quiet and spectacular. I don't give it 5 stars because shadows are missing since the trees planted are still small. A 10 to the reception and the attention of the staff."
85093,644600,4,jorgeb,19/08/2019,"Nice area, 3 minutes walk from the beach. Quiet, except for the first places without light that are close to the town's garbage bins, which gives odors according to the wind and noise of the garbage truck. Bathrooms with showers for € 1/3 minutes, sinks, sinks, etc., all clean. Beautiful sandy beach, with seaweed and stones in the water."
85093,639604,4,annadvives,18/08/2019,A perfect place near the beach and the woman very friendly and luckily was the owner and let us park the motorhome at the end of the parking lot since they had no seats left. Highly recommended
85093,630009,4,donatella63,15/08/2019,"The rest area is very clean and well maintained with marked and well leveled pitches. The only flaw is that it is adjacent to a waste collection and composting area so it is very busy late at night and early in the morning by waste collection truck so a bit noisy and with many annoying flies. The beach is nearby with white sand, I recommend shoes to enter the water because many stones."
85093,624065,5,liberp8,13/08/2019,Very well! We have spent two very comfortable nights. Next to the Agua Amarga beach. Clean bathrooms and the woman always aware that everything is in order and helps you in whatever you need. If we return we will repeat without a doubt!

85093,616431,4,meinlifestylebusiness,10/08/2019,"The space and facilities are clean. There are 3 showers and 3 toilets each, more than on many other pitches. Unfortunately you pay for the cold shower 1 euro, I think a lot. The sea is rocky and some algae are washed up. Bathing with shoes is ok. We stayed three nights, unfortunately, the place has been completely occupied, so little privacy. Pizzaria in the village makes a very good Verdura and is recommended. Small shop and ice cream shop are also available."
85093,613933,5,Vikipe,09/08/2019,"Excellent location, services, all very clean, careful, to spend a few very pleasant days, tranquility with children and our pet only the beach with some stony that you do not see (bring bathing shoes) the crystal clear and pleasant water of 10 ."

It has all the services and the bathrooms are super clean. The large plots and everything is very new. Of course, WIFI is fatal. They didn't load even Instagram photos. The rest all very well"
85093,596929,5,luistxu,04/08/2019,"Magnificent motorhome area 200 meters from the beach in high season € 15 with light, emptying and filling of free black gray water very clean showers and bathrooms also the shower is paid € 1 for 5 minutes."

85093,576051,5,gabla,26/07/2019,The best pitch we have ever found on our trip to Spain and Portugal's coasts. In addition to a tourism authentic place and a beautiful beach. It is definitely worth it. Thank you to the operators!
85093,571320,5,diane91,23/07/2019,Have spent 4 days. Area very good and very clean. For the shade the best is not to put along the cliff but in the middle of a square in the center to have the shadow of one side then the other in the morning and evening. We will come back.
85093,570089,4,SARAI,23/07/2019,"I do not give all the stars for the theme of the shadow, there you can not stop the heat it makes ... awnings until the trees grow would be appreciated. A pity, because the girl who takes it has it very clean and is very willing. The amazing place, next to the beach. Something more expensive than other areas, because of the situation I imagine."
85093,568544,4,caroste1,22/07/2019,Very good despite 3 days of wind with bursts at 50km / h. pity that waste
85093,568148,5,maitetxu87,22/07/2019,"Motorhome area, new, still without shade, but located near the beach of bitter water.Bathrooms and showers very clean. It is worth visiting the town and having a drink. There is a walkway marked as a path that leads to the middle cove, 30 minutes walk, but it was worth it!"
85093,565770,5,nomadtravel,21/07/2019,"Area highly recommended. Urban, new facilities with many services in the village."
85093,563467,5,danirg,19/07/2019,"Perfect location, facilities and treatment. A few meters from the beach, shops, bars, etc ... totally recommended"
85093,563437,5,amrtrigano,19/07/2019,"There are plenty of words for me of the best there are ... clean toilets, showers, attentive ... the shadow is a factor but if you know how to orient yourself when putting the motorhome you control it perfectly. In the late afternoon it usually takes a lot."
85093,558241,4,carlosblay,17/07/2019,"Very frequented at the end of June. Good location a step away from the town beach and the path to the beautiful cove of Enmedio. Good toilets. Good CPR in general. For us, the lack of shade was a big handicap."
85093,546879,5,bassthi,10/07/2019,Highly Recommended. Very nice reception and no 300 meters to the beach. That's exactly how I imagined camping. Here one unintentionally likes to stay longer. 12 € per night + 3 € electricity are perfectly fine. Showers 1 € for 5 min ... Supply and disposal available. Here one unintentionally likes to stay longer.
85093,546771,5,annayoscar,10/07/2019,"Super, recommended 100%. Clean, close to the beach, € 12 without electricity. It has a mattress for children, town with restaurants next door, laundry room. Very, very good place"
85093,522405,5,infante46,20/06/2019,"Little more to say. all right, as some say, for € 15 could include water, but the site is worth it. its location is spectacular, almost on foot from the beach, few Camper park we have like this."

85093,491075,3,Novarock,23/05/2019,Actually very nice pitch not far from the beach. For the mold in the showers and the additional costs of 1 € per 5min showers there is deduction point
85093,486862,5,Saulin,18/05/2019,"Splendid area, quiet place, beautiful population, good cuisine and the area as I said before splendid, hopefully the example and we can continue to enjoy areas as is."

85093,472108,5,Silvia2220222,30/04/2019,"The Area is a wonder you can see it is new, there are toilets and a hot shower for € 1, the night cost us € 12. There are services of all kinds and dogs are accepted. It is next to the beach and the town has a lot of charm. You can go to the coves along the trails."
85093,470379,3,dondon,28/04/2019,"Attendant, a person of few words, allocated us a plot against the rock face, so no evening sun; 15€ with electricity, toilet cubicles are tight, 3 showers 1€ for 5 minutes, washing machine €4, a newish site so it’s clean and well maintained. The grey and chemical dump are in close proximity to some of the plots, so not good if you are next to it. Smart whitewashed village, small supermarket and other shops selling mostly female attire. Site is near to a lovely little beach a couple of minutes walk down the lane, plenty of bar/ restaurants, we ordered the Paella mix, the nice waiter guy said come back in hour as it’s freshly cooked, well worth the wait, delicious with a glass or two of white wine. Safe travels."
85093,458479,5,peritogo,18/04/2019,"Good area, spacious plots with all services, friendly and attentive staff. I would repeat without hesitation."

85093,451649,4,kaz4589,09/04/2019,Lovely little campsite with everything that you need. It's in a beautiful little village with the nicest coffee we've had so far! The only downside was the park at the campsite was a little basic. I would definitely stay here again.
85093,450012,5,S-M-S,06/04/2019,Very well maintained facility with all services - gladly anytime again! Very quiet at night! Highly recommended!
85093,442768,5,knudMcLouis,21/03/2019,"Excellent place to enjoy the PN Cabo de Gata. It is located 2 minutes from the beach, impeccable services, perfect service, and large plots for € 12 for a camper, two adults, a baby and two dogs. Thank you very much to your owners for everything."

85093,434016,4,xaf,26/02/2019,"Located in the same town, correct places with or without electricity. Calm environment at least in winter. The area is nice, nice and not too big. Free Wifi. I consider that for the price you pay, the showers should be free."
85093,430085,5,brammers,16/02/2019,Attractive camper area in a very pretty whitewashed village resort. It was a bit noisier than expected being near the road and with various maintenance vehicles around. You can buy drinks and wine at reception. No supermarket nearby so stock up. In February there are a few restaurants open in the day but not at night. Everything is spotless and a big effort has been made with planting greenery.
85093,429019,4,gypsy1963,13/02/2019,"A very well-kept place, with everything you need. Especially the friendly staff, who takes care of everything and everyone with a lot of patience. We recommend. Away from the hustle and bustle - wonderful. A small village, little going on, but a beautiful bay. For rest and relaxation absolutely 'nice. I will gladly come again!"

Shower very clean, with warm water. For washing only cold water. Playground available. Located in beautiful nature and beautiful village and beach. A completely lovingly furnished place."
85093,426597,5,KABOU,04/02/2019,Brand new area. Very clean. All services. Flat pitches on gravel delimited by marine rope. Sanitary impeccable. Near the village (restaurants) and 200 m from the sea. 12 € / night + 3 € electricity. Possibility washing clothes with fixed drying rack provided. To recommend !
85093,424591,3,SuyBob,25/01/2019,"Area somewhat expensive to be winter, maybe if the showers were free and the WiFi decent ... They leave you a ""tear"" for € 10 bail to get out and enter the premises at the time you want and you can use the bathrooms. The very kind treatment and invite you to a welcome shot!"
85093,424572,2,zalaska,25/01/2019,"2 stars only because if the place is clean and well maintained, it is the only positive point. In this season, the village is dead, holiday homes with 2 restaurants closed at this time. Clientele mainly German. 12 euros without electricity, showers is expensive. If you do not need the services, there are a lot of nice places to sleep at the pass 2 kms away."
85093,424478,5,clauphil,25/01/2019,"Well designed and very nice area, very clean bathrooms, excellent shower 1 €. 15 € per night with electricity, decreasing rates depending on the duration, very good halt."
85093,422642,5,Yoshi-on-Tour,15/01/2019,"There is absolutely nothing negative here. Everything was available, everything works, everything was very clean and well maintained. Nice owner. Wi-Fi was fine, even the electricity! Trash can be disposed about 50 meters from the square. Beach about 5 minutes walk. Also a small shop that opened in the morning. A small bar is right in front of the place. A quiet little village to relax."
85093,421878,5,Latti,11/01/2019,"Closed clean place with clean sanitary facilities, shower 1 euro. very nice, German speaking reception, washing machine and dryer for 4 euros.

85093,420613,1,Hedvan,06/01/2019,Very disappointing. Village was a ghost town and not clean. But good potential. 6 amp but fuse went several times. Free wiffi but didn't work.  You have to walk to village to leave your rubbish. Good hiking and amazing views.
85093,418736,5,Bmariba,01/01/2019,"Very good place, well located, clean bathrooms, the shower is for a fee, € 1 for 5 min, but it's worth it. The only complaints are that the parcels near the road are quite noisy and a rooster that gets up early! :) and that they do not have garbage cans inside."
85093,418735,5,Bmariba,01/01/2019,"Very good Area, the plots have good size. You hear the road a lot if you touch the square in the background, and a rooster that gets up early!;) Otherwise everything is fine, very clean bathrooms, showers are for a fee, € 1 for 5 min, but it's worth it . The only noise is in the area that faces the road and that they do not have buckets to throw the garbage inside."
85093,418662,5,Nippers,01/01/2019,"Very good area, with everything you need to spend some incredible days less than 200 meters from the beach. Unbeatable treatment, with concern that we are as comfortable as possible. Within the area there are no garbage containers by municipal ordinances since all garbage containers in the village are gathered in a square located 300 meters from the area."

85093,397119,3,Zztop,22/10/2018,"Easy, clean, as even described the nocturnal concert of dogs, then roosters. Too bad there is no trash and you have to look for the container in the village. Few people"
85093,396409,3,Marx4,20/10/2018,"Good: - very new, modern and well-kept facilities - friendly staff - location next to Malo beach: - price € 15 that does not include showers (€ 1 5 minutes, € 2 minutes, even if you turn off the tap time counts the same) - mangera of drinking water and wastewater in the same place (a user may voluntarily or involuntarily misuse it)"

Obviously it is not the fault of the area, but my mother, if you are a light sleeper you do not sleep anything here. And in the showers there is no place to support the clothes. Everything else: very good. Without the above: 5 *"

85093,365676,5,tximix,05/09/2018,"The best part of the area, we thought it was a coincidence and we had spent 3 days, moving around the sand and there are many coves around it. The area from where you are walking on the beach for 3 minutes, and the town itself is very nice. Give money out of cash at no extra cash."
85093,361674,4,JBR,01/09/2018,"We have been two days. Good area in every way (toilets, tranquility, attention, proximity to the town and beach ....). I recommend it and I'm sure we'll repeat it."

85093,330288,5,RBGELX,13/08/2018,"I give it a 10, for services, location, comfort, etc. The only one that I see, is the lighting, but the owner has already told me, that due to paperwork problems, they have opened without finishing everything, I hope that the next time, it's finished."

At first we had to wait about 10 minutes (usually not always), but have a buzzer and a telephone to notify and come immediately. The access to the camper zone is very good and the squares are wide. Everything is very clean and well taken care of. The area is two steps from the beach and the town. A great place to base camp and visit the areas of Agua Amarga, Cala de Enmedio, Playa de Los Muertos ... We cost € 12 per day + € 3 for electricity + € 1 for the shower.

When we turned off the lights to sleep around 12 at night (we were 3 women). The man in the car decided to go to our window and ask us if we wanted his company. You can imagine the fear we went through. I just hope it helps you girls"

85381,3151126,5,Petenea,15/08/2023,A beautiful and quiet place to sleep facing the sea and listening to the waves. The civil guard passed and without problems observed and they left. I have read comments about the noise of a disco in our case nothing at all perhaps because it is during the week. I recommend it 100%.
85381,3085223,1,melimelow64,06/08/2023,"Infernal. there is a house next door which organizes parties, we were treated to music all night long. impossible to sleep. I guess it's because it was Saturday night. even with kies balls the sound was way too loud. never again here."
85381,3024439,5,Matthinbcn,26/07/2023,"Extraordinary spot with superb beach especially at low tide. We spent a pleasant night in the sound of the waves, and with respectful roommates. Highly recommend and take care :)"

85381,2967356,1,mrJohnnybegood,15/07/2023,"The place is very nice, in front of a beautiful and quiet beach. But we hardly slept because at 00:30 the dance music started to play at the top and continued until 05:30. There seems to be a nightclub next door, although we didn't see it, we only heard it. It was Friday the 14th of July, I don't know how often they play it, we left the next morning."

Top kite spot, lagoon with standing area (at low tide) towards the bridge."
85381,1921230,1,PolTxetxu,27/05/2022,"attention, dangerous place to sleep. Two nights ago we slept here without any problem, but today we went back to sleep and found two Campers with their front windows smashed. Tonight they threw stones at them."

85381,1892666,5,Lauracali,15/05/2022,"Impressive to spend a few days, you park practically on the beach, which is beautiful. It has the beach showers next to it and is more or less level."
85381,1878261,5,Neum4101,08/05/2022,Very nice little parking lot right on the beach. Ideal for beach activities. Only suitable for small mobiles and vans. We stayed there with five vans and shared space with anglers and surfers.

85381,1623825,4,Melinaa,03/10/2021,"Nice place, but be careful when it rains. The entry and exit is rutted and stony. In combination with wet ground, this leads to tires that spin quickly."
85381,1592980,2,lanjana,19/09/2021,"The site is fine. The problem is that there is an ""element"" that says that it has been here for 1 month and that it is planning to look for trouble. It has been stuck without respecting the distance next to our side door and says that we do not bother it. had a bad day, the figure. With people like this, who will have been here for a month because they will have thrown them home, it is difficult to go around the world. It's dangerous, he's taking photos of the license plate"
85381,1547612,1,ikerlari3,04/09/2021,Very difficult access for motorhomes and large campers. There are few flat parking lots and they are usually occupied by the cars of the neighbors

85381,1294675,4,Asret,04/07/2021,"Access is complicated if you go carelessly, I go with a courier and I have not had any problem, yes, be careful. I think it is one of the most beautiful stops that I have made so far, feeling safe having one more camper and having people living nearby. Precious!"
85381,1118895,1,miguelmlajara,02/12/2020,"Impossible to access with a motorhome. There is a step to enter that if it is very low it is safe. We had to go and it was difficult to turn around, although by maneuvering a lot we managed to get out. I do not recommend for motorhomes."

85381,1032327,5,PaulaCasti,07/09/2020,"Access with van without problem. Quiet place with a lot of charm, grass and sand floor, it is not 100% leveled but nothing scandalous. We slept alone and almost on the beach, all very quiet and perfect, we had no problems and having several houses nearby there is a feeling of security."

85464,3117134,5,cortomontese,10/08/2023,"Yes, the journey via the dirt roads and the railway line is a bit adventurous. But we were there for the second year in a row without any problems. There is no indication of private property anywhere. A few hikers and joggers pass by, all friendly. Long story short: collect the garbage and be friendly to the locals, then it will remain a very good spot."

85464,1918069,5,T4Kasper,26/05/2022,"We had a super quiet night with a magnificent view. Access absolutely no problem, but it should be clear to everyone from the pictures that this is not a spot for the big white glambing suitcases. 4x4 is not necessary."
85464,1537508,5,kokopellis,01/09/2021,"Really great spot - right on the cliffs. A lot of walkers, but no problem at all, are just surprised. With our pickup with cab and 4x4 we got through really well. Just enjoy the area and the sound of the sea!"

85464,1456676,5,JulenCalco,14/08/2021,"As the previous ones explain, access is somewhat difficult for vehicles with low height. We have entered without problems with a Volvo XC70. A 4x4 is not entirely necessary when it is dry. Everyone who values their options. But a vehicle with a little more height is highly recommended, potholes and roots in the route. Bon Voyage."
85464,1449809,5,mamercio,13/08/2021,"Difficult access, the car must be high, but I have accessed without great complications with a California without 4x4 traction (yes, it is important that it has not rained or there is a forecast, with complicated mud it would become impossible). As the path does not appear in google maps, you have to put a satellite view and identify the only path that arrives (there is no loss). The incredible night and the magical morning"
85464,1396684,2,lislontour,02/08/2021,5 star outlook! Under no circumstances should you drive up in your car. We tried the RV and came up. Nature should remain nature.

85464,756522,5,Beule1113,24/12/2019,"Pure nature, lonely and calm. Perfect for us. For a short part of the driveway we needed all-wheel drive, because the short climb was very slippery (wet grass and mud). The path (track width) was sometimes too narrow for our truck, but the short sections were feasible. Since very deep and large puddles have to be driven through, it becomes difficult with normal motorhomes."

85465,1526719,4,calinostra,29/08/2021,"We liked the tranquility and that it has a lot of vegetation. It has water, we believe that it is not drinkable. From the same picnic area, there is a path to see the coastal area. We went around with the van and it has beautiful views."

85512,3196806,5,Revor74,21/08/2023,"All the reviews that I have seen here are very well explained, I just wanted to add that the day you see that there will be a storm, remove the vehicles because they will be under water if they are parked inside, it is a flood zone if it rains a lot."
85512,3167895,5,aellea,17/08/2023,"For what the area is, it is an incredible place, it is next to the beach which has showers every 100 meters and public toilets, in the area there are bars, shops, supermarkets, parks along the promenade every so often... you sleep very peacefully, there is no music nearby and the police often pass by on the road outside. Very good place, it would be ideal if they enabled one as well as an area with water and emptying in the area."

85512,2176567,2,maylis78,05/08/2022,We came just to spend the night and it's really quite difficult: the car park is banked and does not allow you to benefit from the sea breeze to cool the motorhome and its occupants at night. The place is quite dirty (it's sad so close to the sea) and above all we were terribly devoured by mosquitoes hence my note.

Close to the beach 150m on foot and easy to access. The earthen car park does not have any services except garbage cans and showers on the edge of the beach.

This could reduce the pollution of all pitches, which is embarrassing for campers and the local population."
85512,1710623,4,steso,15/12/2021,"The parking lot was partially flooded, but you could still have found a dry place to stay. However, we preferred to stand in the parking lot facing the beach. It was no problem to spend the night there at this time of the year."

I was assigned a seat, although everything was free and the stream was further away. The place was very wet, it was clear in February, but there was still a risk of getting stuck. So I was more on the street. In the morning 7:30 no water, neither toilet nor shower, nor outside to wash up. It was -2 degrees. Should be normal for the region. Therefor 28€ for 1 car+caravan 1 person and dog low season!!!! Unfortunately not recommended for the price!"

Expensive in our opinion. Good shade, beautiful trees, very good pool, very friendly reception staff, clean, nice trails start from there. Too many low branches, the ground instead of grass, few and far between services in our case, a bit old."

There are toilets, but they are closed at the moment. Presumably they only open in the summer."

But it can easily become a very nice spot again as long as there is nice precipitation again to fill it up again."
85600,2253563,5,Calypso2227,17/08/2022,"Ideal as a stopover, especially in the hot period to be able to bathe. The water is not clear but is refreshing. Places under the trees in the shade and view of the water. Lots of dust however in summer."

We spent a peaceful night after many baths in the swamp :) There is a local (non-touristy) cafeteria run by a super kind and attentive family. We ask for description, respect and care for this beautiful place so that they don't privatize or forbid us to continue enjoying places like this on the planet :) We were lucky, no flies!"
85600,2039687,5,leapriez,05/07/2022,"Very friendly, calm and pleasant place. Swimming is allowed as well as dogs with pedal boat rental. Spaces large enough to each have their own space. I highly recommend this place."

85600,897265,4,Luci120,25/07/2020,"Very good site, with very good views and shadows. Ground not very level, but can be improved with chocks. Be careful with leaving the road and approaching the reservoir, because 2 cars have been trapped in the mud in less than 24 hours. For the rest, super good;)"

85651,2451237,4,MarieBERNARDO,19/10/2022,"We slept there two nights without any problem and quite close to restaurants and shops, about 10 minutes on foot. Some very early noise between port workers and traffic on the road. For those who are light sleepers this can be a problem."
85651,2137547,5,artezien,28/07/2022,"A great location if you don't want to look for a place for a long time. We parked a little higher to be 5 minutes from a creek. Ideal for swimming in the afternoon and enjoying the sun. It's not the most glamorous, but for parking during the day, it's super practical… And free! On the other hand, impossible to take out table and chairs."
85651,1749537,3,sebjohn38,06/02/2022,"Attention parking prohibited for motorhomes, that said in this season there was room, so we parked and we went to the page to take a sunbath."

85651,724081,4,calibeach,18/10/2019,"Pretty central parking in roses. The only problem is that you are parked parallel on the same road. But seeing that all parkigs have height restriction or a sign of a banned acs, it is the best option near the center."
85651,614206,4,matexpress,10/08/2019,"A noisy, but very convenient with downtown and large beach right 10 min walk and small beach and trade on the left in 3 min walk and then the port to visit! possibility of filling the faucet with drinking water at the small beach!"

I will return without a doubt"
