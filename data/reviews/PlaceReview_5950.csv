We were able to park in a shaded area (battery area where we parked “badly” in parallel because there was plenty of space and we didn't bother anyone). There are several streets in a residential area where you can park to go to the beach; We went in low season, I don't know how it will be in high season but I guess it will be full.

But it goes with some momentum :) the place is beautiful! The colors of the landscape and the sunrises are breathtaking. Unfortunately, on the third day I was awakened by the Guardia Civil. They were very friendly and did not give me a ticket. Have you still shown that I have even cleared away the garbage of their compatriots."

The rest of the way is very walkable and we were not disturbed by the police. Regarding the wasps actually we were a little disturbed on the early evening but they leave with the darkness. The road that passes above does not disturb absolutely!"

Terribly crowded on weekends, otherwise quiet and close to nature. But: the square is slowly turning into a rubbish dump. Eternal shame! containers are available for this. Please follow the rules (no camping, etc.), we will not be tolerated."
76555,2345167,1,Lorenzosurfero,06/09/2022,"Site with a lot of uneven sand and if it rains badly it clogs you yes or yes, then you can't spend the night and of course you can't take out an awning or chairs and it belongs to the coast, that is, the Civil Guard fines, the locals there puncture your wheels and be careful with what you leave in sight, many thefts in the Motorhomes. Be careful with this site."
76555,2193831,4,desevilla,07/08/2022,"I have come to this place a lot, it is good to spend the day, if you take a place you are on the beachfront, the parking lot is dirt-sand. At night it is forbidden to spend the night, there are those who stay and the fine comes after 8 months. And there are those who are lucky and do not get fined for 4 days. We slept at the entrance before the coast limit sign. Crowded weekend."

Trouble getting there, difficult to maneuver, full of AC and passenger cars. Only day parking and no shade, services etc. Best Punta Candor in Rota for €5 or the campsite next door. And be careful with the fines if you stay overnight, which are €200 minimum."

76555,1725185,1,Lorenzosurfero,03/01/2022,"Well, a confusing beach and you never know when the Civil Guard is going to fine you because it is a coast, a lot of sand and there is always someone stuck. Local surfers as normal do not let them enter the Peak. And if that happens then you fight. I do not recommend it at all."

Let's see if we find out that this is considered Camping and is prohibited."
76555,825639,5,JoseyCharo,15/06/2020,"We have been the weekend and the Civil Guard has come several times and they have only told us not to take out the tables next to the caravan, because you cannot camp there, but otherwise, if you take a place, everything is perfect"

Ultramastered, one of the owners of the surrounding houses we saw him scratching motorhomes with a key, apart from that he felt bad atmosphere with those who seemed to be from the Zone. I do not recommend it"

76575,2724373,2,MarcosGD,05/05/2023,"We did not sleep, the parking lot is small and very steep. The views are very beautiful. The way to get there is quite bad."
76575,2314194,5,Ionion64,28/08/2022,Very nice lake for our first night in a van with two children. A first car park can park two or three vans and a passage gives access to a very spacious picnic area but we did not dare to venture there with the van for fear of being locked in (sign entry ban in Basque). We were all alone. Lots of sheep but not aggressive. Great spot!
76575,2227959,5,malouelfriede,13/08/2022,"Amazing view on the lake &farm close by. A bit scary because we arrived in the night and couldnt see anything, and we were the only one parking there. We saw some remnants of the ‘insulin’ incident another was speaking about in a review. In the morning the police came, but they just made a round and left again: not bothering us whatsoever. Still, gave us a bit of anxiety. Cool animal sounds around"
76575,2178238,5,valcrouzes,05/08/2022,"Great for 1 night, deserves 1 tree. possibility of parking 2 large C because. Access to the lake, superb view, sheep around the lake but which do not interfere, not seen any ants and only a few flies (we are in the middle of nature at the same time) people pass because further there are tables and barbecues (padlocked when we were there) but very quiet and go as the sun goes down. I highly recommend"
76575,1934435,3,Dragonfly_on_the_road,31/05/2022,"This spot is near a farm. The whole area (and even the spot) is for grazing cows and sheep (at least at this time of year, May 31) making it a fly-filled area. . It's crawling. There are also a lot of ants (really a lot) in quite a lot of space in the grass. It does not leave much space to land and even reading a book outside was annoying as the flies are present. Too bad, the view is great and the area looks quiet. We only stayed there for a few hours and we fled?"
76575,1798302,2,Bluesvaner,28/03/2022,Very nice setting but there are a lot of noisy people wanting to park in the tiny parking lot. Sloping ground except 2 or 3 seats at most. Narrow and bumpy access road.

After we watched him inject his necessary dose of insulin,that nice man began to horn clacson to the rythm.Two hours later of this amazing performance, we had to leave,dissapointed missing the final part of the show. Otherwise,the place was rubbish:-)"

And bars in front of the playground. We do not sleep. Beware of GPS. He sent us for a bridge of 2.75m in height. We had to go back in the forbidden direction, cutting off the traffic. Better to go through fields."

76648,3257504,1,Levi,04/09/2023,"Inadvisable except for small campers. The spaces are for cars and it is full until the end of the day. Let us not insist on occupying spaces that do not belong to us. Much better is the nearby parking lot, 5 minutes away, large and spacious."
76648,2597909,3,PauloMozBarbosa,04/03/2023,Five minutes from downtown. There are several flat places for a quiet night.

76648,1601683,4,LuliLulineta,23/09/2021,"To spend a night is fine, some places are inclined but others are not, it gave us more security to sleep in this square than in other parking lots that are more solitary"
76648,979073,3,Caro-tide,18/08/2020,"Parking rather quiet at night and hectic the day we spent a pleasant night. Accessible to large riders, 3.5m high and 9m long."
76648,782552,1,GillG,18/02/2020,Really I cannot recommend this carpark at all.  We arrived after dark and it was still very full with cars and more cars were arriving.  The worst part that it is very sloping.  We left and went to the carpark near the bullring which is level and spacious.
76648,590754,3,rrhsevilla,01/08/2019,"Public parking Very close to the center of Santarem. It is a busy parking lot during the day, it is best to arrive just to sleep and take the opportunity to leave the van there to visit the town the next day. I take this opportunity to say that we dined at the Taberna de Sebastián, and dined at luxury and cheap."
76648,427577,2,romeo,08/02/2019,Very nice .... we parked in the parking lot next to the larger and more practical arena
76648,323429,3,pacospain,09/08/2018,Place to know the city and spend a night. Containers nearby

76664,892743,3,CatMary,23/07/2020,"Service station next to a restaurant. To fill the tank with clean water it is next to the air device for the tires. It takes a while but it's ok. For the gray and black waters it is next to the car wash. I leave a photo of the place where the black waters are discharged because it is not very noticeable, it has no indications."
76664,787461,5,Koocko,27/02/2020,The black and gray waters are next to the car wash. The very kind employees

76664,749585,5,TimNWright,03/12/2019,"Great to have free services in such a remote location. Ignore the height warning - we are over 3m and there was no problem. The black water disposal is NOT in the toilets. If you face the diy car wash facility, just to the right there is a large square metal manhole cover. In the middle of it is a small hatch - this can be used for black and grey waste. I chose to drop my grey waste in the pressure washing bay round the back as the hatch was a bit small to aim for. There is no tap to rinse the cassette close by but I used my grey water. The water is over by the HGV diesel pump. It’s a bit slow but fine."
76664,748279,4,kexo,29/11/2019,"Used for white and gray. clean water has narrow pistol, so it takes a while to fill the tank. We confirmed at the staff that water is drinkable"

76664,434284,4,lexie2317,27/02/2019,"Free to empty grey & black water and to fill up with fresh water too! The fresh water takes a while to fill full tank but who cares when it’s free?! Be careful when emptying black water as it is just into a toilet - if you make a mess, clean it up- services like this are a fantastic and if mis-used it may be stopped."
76664,420068,4,vintageb3,04/01/2019,Attendant very helpful. Showed me where to dump grey water and where to fill with water. Water is slow as it’s a gas station trigger for topping up radiator. You dump black down WC so be clean guys as this service could be easily withdrawn if it’s abused and left dirty!

Because it is particularly narrow to access it. more work is being done at the moment in the village. you have to go through a very narrow alley and with balconies 3 m high! So van or van of 6m max!"
76678,2553191,5,livingPacolife,16/01/2023,"Nice place, close to the town but not many cars here. Friendly people walking by. Also good starting place for hikes. (Ps: watch out in Benahavis with big campers, there are some small narrow steep roads here! Best to stay on the outside of the village)."

For now, you can spend the night in the open field next door. The area has all services except electricity. It is perfect for spending the night, but since there is no shade when it is hot, spending the day will be somewhat uncomfortable. Playground in front. Thanks to Tárrega for hosting us."

But from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. it is impossible to be there if you have a dog, many flies directly into the dog's eyes. Neither citronella candles, nor incense, nor fly swatters. A pity, but if you don't want your dog to have a bad time, look for other options."
76817,3183756,5,Mazacolt,19/08/2023,"The campsite of 10, clean and well-maintained facilities. Very very kind people. The only drawback are the mosquitoes in August and more specifically the stable fly, which having a dog is somewhat dangerous and very annoying for the animal, since they land in its eyes and can transmit worms. Even so, since it is not something from the Persian camping, I give it 5 stars."

76818,1415131,3,jcfsup,06/08/2021,"Family camping, very friendly manager. It does not have a restaurant, you have to go out right next to it. Not a good site for large motorhomes (> 7 meters). The plots are boxed in and you cannot maneuver, thus losing half a plot. Ok for one night, but no more."

76818,942923,5,Maceira906866,09/08/2020,"I do not usually respond to comments, but I think there are some data that do not conform to reality, for the night they charge € 9.90 and it gives the right to park in an area marked for it within the campsite, it is not on the street or a field, 2 people are included who can use all the services of the campsite, including the swimming pool, all the plots include ELECTRICITY"

76818,927364,1,XQlero,04/08/2020,"As good and beautiful as the campsite is, I don't think about the motorhomes, 10 euros to park in an open field and above all you can't do it until 8pm. Either that, or the 40 euros they nail you to ""camp."""

In the square great showers (rain showers) a pool, nice things a lot of rental paions, yakuzie for rent barbecue areas and much more. Small but very good in everything. Particularly noteworthy is the team. In the low season is only a toilet house and for men there was only a single sink for everything. Upon request, another wash house was opened immediately. That's really attentive. We drove specially from the coast to relax for a few days from the swirling sea and do not regret it."

The staff very friendly."

Algae on the beach, for me it is not a problem, it is part of the sea, you pass it and you can swim or bathe without any problem. The town of Nigrán and Baiona are nearby, very friendly staff"
76822,2049323,3,dadoncamillo,08/07/2022,Beginning of July with 2.5 people in a campervan. Complex very large and very beautiful and well-kept. sanitary facilities impeccable. standard pitches very small. Larger pitches very expensive and despite the surcharge for the 1st row actually no view because they are on the land side (ria). at low tide very strong smell of algae. Only bungalows facing the sea. very busy because very popular with families with children.
76822,1976549,3,Al-paca,14/06/2022,"Very nice location. Sanitary facilities new and well maintained. At the exits/entrances there are gates with access cards, only got one for two people & the gates often don't work. The first two nights the restaurant, shop and pool were closed, but there was no discount. The staff often only spoke Spanish and was unorganized - also in the restaurant the food was underwhelming."
76822,1975132,2,PSTM,14/06/2022,"from us there are only 2 stars despite the top facility and strong wifi. Reason: swimming in the sea is not possible, too many algae, that's probably why there are jacuzzis in the bungalows ;-). At low tide there is a strong swamp smell. if that doesn't bother you...it's ok, the rest was great."
76822,1935521,3,zachariah273,31/05/2022,Well maintained campsite on the beach. Very bureaucratic though - We got assigned the pitch right by the toilets even though it was quiet and 95% of pitches not taken. Extra charge for pitches looking out over the bay. Facilities are brand new but expected for €27 a night.
76822,1934318,5,BerndRudde,31/05/2022,"Not cheap even in the pre-season at €27, but with excellent sanitary facilities, strong WiFi and a great location! About 5 minutes by bike to beautiful Baiona!"
76822,1932224,3,melaniehardman,30/05/2022,"Super clean location. Friendly staff. Great location. It’s not a 5* as it was the most expensive site we’d stayed on at €27.50 for a van, 2 people, no EHU. The beach had a HUGE shelf on it which made walking down for a swim challenging (not sure what the site owners can do about that though). We loved Baiona. All being said it you want to see Baiona this is the best place)."
76822,1880160,4,Gutifu,09/05/2022,Recommended campsite. We were at Easter and it was quiet. The bathrooms always clean. Large plots with views. It also has some very nice bungalows.
76822,1838955,4,johnreed078,19/04/2022,"Considering its beautiful location, almost surrounded by water, and the facilities which were spotless, I did not mind paying a bit more here. I would not want to be here during holidays and the summer when I can imagine it would get very busy and noisy. But that is my personal preference."
76822,1828041,4,coco29340,16/04/2022,"Campsite well located by the beach. Calm, family. Large clean toilets. Only pity that the cafeteria is closed during a local holiday period (Holy Week). Shops of basic necessities accessible at 15 min on foot."

76822,1560558,3,Califurgo,08/09/2021,It is a camper complex that has it all. Lots of people and lots of noise too. In the standard plots hardly even the van enters the rest of the upper level plots are perfect plots. The bathrooms are top including the one for babies
76822,1547684,5,ulligw,04/09/2021,"Very nice and clean place, right on a super sandy beach"
76822,1542240,5,ricardogotcha,03/09/2021,"Very nice campsite. It has beach access, excellent condition, very clean, very quiet, has lots of activities and is situated in a very beautiful location. It's super close to the center and has bike paths for cycling or jogging just outside the park."
76822,1535905,1,DavidRH88,31/08/2021,"The campsite of 10, facilities of 10, beach at 20m. the handicap is the cafeteria, which treats the usual well and the rest not. I am telling this right now that it just happened to me that they treated me badly after spending a lot of money yesterday and today. Unfortunately the management of the bar."
76822,1530510,1,Carlos66,30/08/2021,"Very expensive, not in France or Holland so expensive, a bungalow is worth more for that price."
76822,1513837,3,Durdurc,26/08/2021,"Large pitches overlooking the marsh. Pool with a capacity of 80 people, very small for the size of the campsite. Convenient to regulate the time in the pool. Beach with a lot of seaweed, unpleasant to bathe. A single area for emptying gray water throughout the campsite, insufficient, in the middle of a street with plots on both sides, where there was a shop totally dotted with gray water."
76822,1498057,5,camper_308,22/08/2021,"Camping of 10 the bathrooms were clean and quite new they have a restaurant that was attended to 10 by its staff, you have a beach and swimming pool and the town that you can go for a walk would return"
76822,1488468,3,Plaeuskadi,20/08/2021,"Good camping regarding location and cleanliness of common areas but it is quite crowded. Very poor children's entertainment and the restaurant expensive although you eat very well. The pool has no place to be, or you bathe or you go and the Super is very good. The beach FULL of seaweed. Best beach america"
76822,1486997,5,Marcosluna,20/08/2021,"I am very satisfied with the campsite, it is very well located because it is next to the beach, the restaurant is a couple of meters away with good views and above all the waiter Bruno is very friendly and good professional, the pool is very good for the kids, the lifeguard very attentive to all good work on the campsite, we will be back shortly"
76822,1486892,3,Eli13,20/08/2021,"We have gone directly, without calling and there was a small plot left, with a 5.40 just van but you enter. They have been very kind to us and have recommended that we go in to see the plot to confirm if the van would enter. The facilities are good and clean and the area is beautiful but it is very very crowded, it has been impossible to wash clothes, we have thrown laundry in Baiona and great."
76822,1465275,4,yoryo123,16/08/2021,"Camping quite crowded in high season there is a waiting list for days you call and they put you on the list and call you as the plots are emptied, the luxury toilets for cleanliness and quality of service the bar restaurant a luxury to drink or eat on the spot somewhat expensive beach. The prices are not bad if you compare it with other coastal campsites of the same level. Pretty small pool."
76822,1453114,1,sonrisusan,14/08/2021,"Aupa! We are traveling ""on the march"" with two small children. We called the campsite to see if they had a place. That there was a “waiting list” and to call the next day. We called and they didn’t know if it would be there, maybe without electricity, maybe two days in different places ... They would call us at 1pm if there was a place and they wouldn’t call us. Cold treatment. What does he think? Will we be waiting for them?"
76822,1439964,4,beriweb,11/08/2021,"Many people on these dates. Very clean bathrooms. Terrace overlooking the beach to spend a very pleasant time drinking a cool mojito. And it is quite expensive. One last comment. We have come with two motorhomes. The second stayed outside the campsite in a great parking lot. Quiet night, close to the beach."
76822,1391321,4,Rafikis,01/08/2021,"Although the entrance is a bit of a mess, it is to some extent understandable given the dates we are in. The campsite is not bad (impeccable services), but the best thing without a doubt is its location, the swimming pool and the restaurant. Recommended, but expensive"
76822,1387638,3,Gwaihir,31/07/2021,"Contradictory feelings. Unbeatable location, beautiful views, bike path to Baiona, cleanliness of bathrooms and showers is honorable; the space is squeezed to the maximum: the squares, even the largest (and most expensive) are not very loose, narrow interior streets and everything very close together; even access is too fair for large ACs. And yes, the emptying and filling area is lousy."
76822,1382594,3,inaki1981,30/07/2021,"The camping in location and services is very good. The bathrooms are perfect all day. Quite squeezed space. But the water filling and emptying system is by far the worst I have ever seen. It shouldn't be or allowed. Planted in the middle of a street, surrounded by plots, whoever receives that plot is not going to have a dream vacation precisely ..."

76822,1334785,1,Freerules,18/07/2021,A bit expensive and if you are looking for tranquility it is not the right place .. very noisy .. nobody controls the noise after 24:00. at peak times there are queues to shower and wash .. even though it is COVID time the capacity is not controlled and there are 100% more people who enter continuously from outside .. the only good thing is the location and cleanliness ..
76822,1323384,2,naxs,14/07/2021,"Exaggeratedly expensive, fair pitches and very crowded, swimming pool with a good slide and exit to the beach full of seaweed, very spacious and clean toilets and showers but very little water pressure."
76822,1318426,4,carlosmg,12/07/2021,"Highly recommended, a bit expensive, but all its facilities are perfect. With pool with slide and direct access to the beach. Correct emptying area for a 7m car."
76822,1291826,4,Pitiuser,02/07/2021,"Clean facilities, but quite noisy. Very familiar, the children have a blast because they have a thousand things to do (playground with zip line, swimming pool, sports fields ...). On the beach, the bar / restaurant of the campsite is very cool in quality and price."
76822,1280542,5,drlago,27/06/2021,"Super campsite, with all services, spacious pitches with shade and hedges separating them. With access to the beach, and pool with slide. Restaurant and a supermarket where there is everything. With AC of 6.7 meters we had no problems maneuvering, although you have to pass the entrance carefully because it is narrow and a bit low. I recommend the pitches overlooking the marsh."
76822,1279717,5,Tiago1234,27/06/2021,"Fantastic restaurant with pool bar and water park. WC with bathtub and shower for the little ones Minus points: Being able to have a barbecue in all areas of the park near the campervans, lack of WC near the swimming pools, entrance very restricted in height for the campervans at the reception, little entry control for people outside the park. .. Positive points cleaning the shower toilet"

The roads are very narrow for AC and the area for emptying and filling water is very bad, narrow and with difficult access and there is only one place to empty in a very large campsite. Everything else is very good but the price seems very expensive."
76822,1023193,5,llaniskos,03/09/2020,"Very good experience. We spent two nights, we took the good pitches for the caravan and very well. Super quiet to sleep in and clean. The girls loved the pool."

76822,1013406,5,rodada2014,30/08/2020,"Large campsite with plenty of site and all the necessary for the motorhome. Very advisable. The worst, and it is nothing of the campsite, the northwestern air that when it enters there is nothing to stop it and it is felt. The best, Bayonne and the surroundings."

76822,992510,3,tortugon,22/08/2020,"All good as always, the only downside is with the parcels assigned. When we arrived they gave us one without shade or the possibility of laying. We commented on it, and although there were several empty ones, they denied us the change. A week in the sun and seeing better empty plots. In my opinion, the high price for the services they have. Cleaning well. Correct Covid protocol."
76822,980336,4,Sergio20,19/08/2020,We spent two nights at the Camping. First line of the beach and very complete in terms of services but expensive. (€ 47 per night in August for AC with two people)
76822,895962,3,touch,24/07/2020,"Small standard plot, be careful if you go with a large volume or a large motorhome, in some plots the turns can be complicated, little habitability on the plot once the vehicle is in. I travel with a T4 camper. 2020: common areas (toilets) with young people who have long stayed at the campsite without keeping recommended distances or capacity, maybe another year I'll come back and raise your score"

Supper sun gears to admire. 2 nights with 2 adults in the motorhome incl. VE 68 €, price is OK"
76822,663766,4,laikatita,28/08/2019,Good campsite. Beach right next door. Lots of shadows. Generous portions. Interesting pool with slide. WC always clean. On foot we easily reached the nearest villages for dinner or ice cream. The drawbacks were the waiting time to check in due to lack of available spaces upon arrival. Make a reservation. High prices 2 nights 115 euros.
76822,661190,5,Van2indaroad,26/08/2019,"Camping with all services. Good value, although not cheap. Direct access to the beach, restaurant, super, swimming pool and bike rental, kayas and paddle boards."

A but very large, it seems incredible that a campsite with so many families like this one does not have a pool for young children. The one they have has a minimum depth of 1.1m. And it's something carillo, really."

76822,520192,3,Sonicj,18/06/2019,"Lovely location, nice beach and surroundings. Easy walk to town/marina. On the downside campsite way overpriced and very 2 sided - beachside is all bungalows/new camping pods and seasonals. The camping pitches are on the opposite side and on check in was told it had lovely views across the water and on the printed site map it shows it as golden sand but in fact when the tide is low it’s a green mud lagoon viewed through a chain link fence. Also some road noise from camping side. Tricky entrance with large motor home. Showers/toilets clean but hot water a bit hit & miss. Also only able to pay cash when leaving or bank transfer on arrival. Cash machines in reception charge a fee and pay in euros or the exchange rate is very bad."
76822,495917,3,theklaa,29/05/2019,"Nice reception at the reception and well separated plots. The toilets and showers are clean. The only downside: the restaurant, the supermarket and the bar are closed until further notice. If you need bread or other food, you are forced to go to the village."
76822,487666,5,Domi44,19/05/2019,"Beautiful campsite located between the beach and the lagoon 2.5 km from the city center served by a bike path and pedestrian.

The area where we stayed was relatively quiet, but you have to be lucky with the neighbors that touch you since as you are unlucky, forget about resting as the campsite passes olympically. Another thing to say is that it has a swimming pool and water slide, but remember that you will have to share it with the people on the beach who are not from the campsite, they give temporary passes and there people come in droves so, be careful with your things if You leave them in the pool .... It has a supermarket and restaurant with an extraordinary beach. We liked the area, but not the treatment of the campsite."

Certainly, the price is a little higher than elsewhere (26 € / day for a camper / 2 adults and electricity). Of course, there are not all the conveniences (evacuation of gray water in the bucket, no washing machine) but considering the absence of alternative in the immediate vicinity, and the kindness of the staff, we accept to pay a bit more expensive"

(It was Monday) the campsite is full and the bathrooms are very clean, they are not new but there are separate services: sinks, showers (bathtubs) and toilets. Direct exit to a super nice beach. Correct service attention."
76829,2196255,2,guyr,08/08/2022,Small location but with a view of the beach and direct access to it. The toilets and the showers are a little dirty but still good. INCOMPREHENSIBLE because they do not take ice packs but sell ice cream. €8.50 person + €10 van + €7.50 tent + €7 electricity. Very expensive for the services €50 for 3 people and minimalist reception. The only + of this campsite is the access to the beach
76829,2187898,4,esobus,06/08/2022,Nice little campsite. Very good reception and a lot of free places in the middle of August without reservation. It's perfect for a few nights. In addition there is direct access to the beach.

They assume the mistake, we ask for the amount and they return it to us, but why do we complain, if not... they don't even pay attention to us. Not recommendable"

Beach less than 100 meters from your motorhome. To enter it is better to go a little further forward and turn around (it is much better to enter especially if you carry a large AC).

I have to highlight the precaution that exists with the whole COVID issue, which gives a lot of confidence, in terms of the separation of plots, disinfection of common areas, as well as the mandatory use of a mask at all times.

76838,3166197,1,ValeriaB,17/08/2023,"camping for tents, not for campers. places for campers are very few. we paid €38 for one night in advance only to discover that there weren't any pitches long enough to fit a 7m motorhome. walked out and lost the money paid"
76838,3150880,3,gaizkabar,15/08/2023,"Camping on a very narrow street, many cars parked wrongly along the way, small pitches and lots of noise all day. clean toilets and the supermarket is open every day without a break. two beaches nearby and breathtaking views. The bus to Sanxenxo juate near the entrance of the campsite"
76838,2937336,2,calamoucho,08/07/2023,"I have never seen so many badly parked cars in a campsite in my life. They do not put them in the plots, they park in the streets of the campsite, in free plots. Anywhere. We had a free plot right next to it and almost always 2 cars in them with the nose inside ours. We will not repeat."
76838,2822036,1,parknuit29,05/06/2023,There is nothing heavenly about this campsite apart from the beautiful beaches nearby! Shelters denature the seaside. The caravans are all in single file and uninhabited at this season. The bathrooms were quite clean…
76838,2675097,5,comun187,16/04/2023,"Spectacular camping, beautiful beaches on both sides of the camping, very good attention, the owner Marisa is charming"
76838,2651624,3,GuilleyNatalia,08/04/2023,Pretty sloppy and out of control. The campers park the car however they want and you arrive with the motorhome and you have a hard time getting through without touching them. It's a shame because the views are spectacular. At Easter cafeteria and supermarket closed.
76838,2411417,1,triciaglover,29/09/2022,Im here and im leaving. Awful place. No one  at reception. All the good pitches are taken up with permanent/ shut down vans. Everything is shut down. Do not recommend
76838,2378127,4,Paepper,16/09/2022,"Thanks to the low season, we had one of the few pitches right on the fence with a view of the sea. Places are rather small. Sanitary facilities in the corner of the campsite are newer and better. The two bays are very beautiful. Thanks to Acsi, the price was a very good deal"
76838,2292849,5,otilia43,24/08/2022,"Very well located campsite, large plots with grass, very good service, a wonderful cafeteria, two beautiful beaches"
76838,2229748,4,sangor88,13/08/2022,"We went to this one because it was the one where the dog was admitted. We spent two nights when we were only going to spend one. The first very quiet night, the second… a lot of noise (Friday). We don't give 5 stars for that. Otherwise everything very well. Clean bathrooms and great treatment."
76838,2203162,2,MariaBA,09/08/2022,"Location on beautiful beaches, grassy plots. Clean bathrooms. Poorly conditioned for motorhomes, emptying of water that is not very accessible, on a slope, so that half of the tank remains full, streets with cars that you do not enter. Expensive for the services it offers."
76838,2200641,3,gmsebastian,08/08/2022,"The location is good, it is full of caravans and fixed shops. The beach is also good, we only stayed one night because it is very noisy, it was 12 at night and the kids were still playing ball, screaming and running around the campsite. It was like being at the exit of a screaming school that lasted until very late."
76838,1877193,4,Rodacar,08/05/2022,"Very nice, you find a place and you sit down, a lady comes to you to register at the end of the day. Terraced camping, almost flat and large places. Very clean toilets. Very nice beach and walking path."
76838,1544604,5,abeccas,03/09/2021,"Quiet, beautiful campsite and above all in an incredible enclave. with the ASCI card, an almost motorhome area price."
76838,976380,1,t334,18/08/2020,Large motorhomes cannot change waters because they cannot maneuver
76838,964187,4,Familiaizquierdo,15/08/2020,"Very good option near sanxenxo and portovo, to go by bike or take a very pleasant 20 minute walk. Good services, and a very nice beach in front. The campsite has a supermarket that has EVERYTHING. We paid € 25 / day for two people, without plugging in, the only downside, the draining area of gray water not very adequate, difficult to maneuver ... the rest was phenomenal"
76838,954764,5,tormunio,12/08/2020,"Great facilities, bathrooms with a shower for the disabled adapted, the price is very good 11e x the camper van without light since we have a second battery with solar panel 13e the 2 people at 6.5 per day and 3e x a dog is great"
76838,887481,4,carantiguax,21/07/2020,"Well located between two beautiful beaches that are accessible on foot from the campsite. You can reach the town by a new ride that they have enabled, also by bicycle. Correct and clean facilities. It may be that the occupation was less due to the current situation, but we were able to choose between several places, more than adequate for a CA."
76838,719457,3,Devos,12/10/2019,"We participate in the XXXIV Seafood Camp. Organized by the CC De Vigo club. We arrived from Andalusia. The campsite full of fixed facilities .. Some very uneven sites. Services in normal conditions. The price increased by about 90% compared to last year. It is considered low sensitivity with this club, but ..... the happy law of supply and demand plays its role."
76838,639987,2,luiscamper,18/08/2019,"Camping crowded with caravans that are all year round, good access to the beaches, toilets to improve, attentive staff"
76838,524814,2,filipeafife,22/06/2019,"Service was poor. Bathrooms in need of maintenance, closed cafeteria, very uneven terrain and occupied mostly by carriages and annual tents. The mains did not work properly. Good access to the beaches (good point)."
76838,355431,3,ManuWater,27/08/2018,"Small gray water drainage area to maneuver, showers have little capacity of hot water, good access to the beach."
76841,2879312,4,lydie65360,22/06/2023,"Very quiet campsite outside the weekend, because the vast majority of pitches are occupied by caravans for the season. They only seem to be inhabited on weekends. Please note that there are less than ten pitches available for passing motorhomes or vans."
