100426,919840,3,Srdepaz,02/08/2020,The site is certainly very quiet but there is a lot of garbage nearby and dogs loose
100430,2281515,3,elodieprz,21/08/2022,"Nice quiet spot in the fields near a village, on the edge of a river but no access for swimming. The place is very quiet we were completely alone all night but no convenience on site."
100430,1686171,5,JeanneCasseron,12/11/2021,"Nice place to spend the night. Very calm, nice view on the village. The water point no longer works. River right next to it, it's nice!"
100430,1529035,3,LaPatoneta,29/08/2021,"Good place to spend the night, quiet and shady. Tap at the entrance to the soccer field. The gate was closed. A bit abandoned, with the flora dry and tall, without clearing. No toilets and no access to swim in the river."
100430,1486216,5,musikero,20/08/2021,"Very quiet and cozy place next to the Rivera del Tormes, it has a recreational area with BBq and a very cool bridge that leads to the river. We have not done the night but you can stay the night, it is Camper Friendly!"
100430,1278370,5,fidelgs,26/06/2021,"The place is spectacular. Very quiet and pleasant. The girl at the bar was very nice and prepares some delicious paellas, yes, reserving."
100430,1162581,5,tomillosax,01/04/2021,We have spent a night and why lie ... Give a little respect for loneliness. Access by narrow road. 2.3 x 6m to spare. There is a small stretch of land to access without problem. In the village they told us that we could sleep anywhere that no one would tell us anything. The place is excellent to spend the day and the town with numerous murals painted on its facades is curious. People 10
100430,924371,3,alban74,03/08/2020,"Pretty park, shaded, calm, possibility of walk to the river. But the water point no longer works, no toilet, little maintenance."
100430,894708,5,iamael523,24/07/2020,We spent one night where we were going late on the road. It is advisable before going to call the Town Hall. The place is open even if the gates are closed. The locals are very friendly.
100430,890460,1,Mikelon020,23/07/2020,"Arriving at the place I had to turn aside on the road because a car was coming. In it, a scruffy-looking man with an unfriendly face made me roll down the window. I wonder if ""I was going to park there"", and he told me that we were going to be ""Puta madre"" in a somewhat ironic and macabre tone. It is free of interpretations ... but we left and will not return."
100430,880978,4,kebra1213,19/07/2020,A great picnic area next to the Tormes River. A quiet place in the middle of nature. We notified the City Council that we would spend the night there and without problem.
100430,733240,2,neo2019,29/10/2019,"A point for the water (with leaky faucet) and a point for the possibility of sleeping. Place left abandoned, everything is wire, you have to pass through the fence to use the tap. Let's say the place is helping out, nothing more!"
100430,705942,4,chantal1660,27/09/2019,"Beautiful place, follow children's playground.aire.robinets drinking water.populations very accueillante.calme absolute."
100430,582845,5,sylaudre,29/07/2019,Very nice place very quiet drinking water no draining games for kids soccer field provide anti mosquito
100430,461681,4,Marsete,21/04/2019,"We arrive at night and give a little respect, on top of the pta you get yourself and there is no one, complete darkness, it seems that you are doing something wrong .... But we have spent the night super quiet, by day is something else."
100433,3090830,4,MariayCarlos,06/08/2023,quiet place to spend the night
100433,1522995,1,adrianpallin,28/08/2021,Parking is prohibited with go ...
100433,1136774,4,SmallWorldsPodcast,12/02/2021,Busy with people and cars. But free parking all day and night and no issues staying in van overnight. Easy to walk to all of the town and really nice place to visit.
100433,1065127,3,wanillo,23/09/2020,"It is a wasteland on the outskirts since it is impossible to leave it near the old town. It is near a school, to access the slopes are very steep and there is a lot of traffic. We could notice prying eyes and whispers while we ate inside, and without taking anything out, only the window open due to the heat. We did the shopping in the supermarket next door because it gave us a feeling of little prepared for tourism. We spend the day, we don't spend the night"
100433,568190,3,JuliaAlgeciras82,22/07/2019,"The town was full and we spent a night here, it is a esplanade a little left without services and about 10 minutes walking from the center, the way is downhill but the bill is uphill. Playground right next door. Castro Usuals is worth visiting, a walk through the port very pleasant and lively."
100473,3261774,4,claudiaxsr,05/09/2023,We parked the motorhome during our walk along the Cares route from Poncebos. It is about 2km (20min walking by road) from the town. In Poncebos it is difficult to park motorhomes and we did not want to risk it. I recommend trying to park on the sides as it is more level.
100473,3194983,3,joseswan,21/08/2023,"Quiet place to sleep, sloping but quiet. The bad thing is that it smells too much like urine"
100473,3122055,5,zosteiros,11/08/2023,"Parking 2 km from the town of Poncebos. The terrain is sloped towards the center, but on the sides there are straight surfaces, perfect for sleeping. It does not have bathrooms or services, but the landscape is very beautiful."
100473,3083153,4,Xepi10,05/08/2023,Quiet place with beautiful views. Only a few squares without unevenness. Two kilometers from the Ruta del Cares.
100473,3010561,4,Word.by.Fly,23/07/2023,Excellent view surrounded by mountains. Land with a lot of unevenness
100473,2922863,5,Mini-Molly,04/07/2023,Very beautiful view. The night was very quiet. A handful of campers have spread out well here. It's hard to find a level spot. There is a bus every hour to the mountains. A great place from which you can then drive to the Picos de Europa. The hikes here are really nice.
100473,2905205,4,4833,29/06/2023,"Acceptable for one night before the Cares route. Incredible views but uneven. Asphalt parking with no place to go on foot (complicated with a dog). For the Cares route you can park in Poncebos, next to the road, a 6m drive or even a little longer if you leave early (8am) and avoid walking on the road. Much more restaurants offer in Cain than in Poncebos (hotels only)."
100473,2843059,3,Moji2ks,11/06/2023,Parking with many spaces for a change in the area. It fulfills its function. With traffic because it is next to the highway of the Cares route and somewhat uneven. Although much better to sleep here than directly in the villages.
100473,2830544,5,Bennilein,07/06/2023,Spent two nights here and found it very enjoyable beautiful sunrise/sunset views and a nice place to start hiking or take the bus rubbish bin is down the road thanks for the free use of this area for the RV
100473,2752759,1,anexploring,15/05/2023,"Steep entrance! Unfortunately, I'm docked with the trailer hitch (L3H2) ... You don't have a network either and the parking lot is very crooked. The only positive aspect: the view is really nice!"
100473,2732124,4,jgcamper,07/05/2023,Highly Recommend this park. Very quiet night spent with a number of other vans. Ground is a little uneven but flatter spots are found at the bottom of the car park. Poncebos can easily be walked to 2km up the road which has lots of trail heads for popular hikes. There is daytime only parking there near the train station and along the road if an additional 2km to your hike is not for you! 4* due to uneven ground. There is one general waste bin on the road before entering the car park. No other amenities.
100473,2719897,4,MissL,03/05/2023,"I recommend this car park. Quiet and with beautiful views. Perfect for sleeping except for the unevenness. But hey, it was worth it for the views. There is no coverage or garbage cans... It is 2km from Poncebos. On the way to Poncebos you can park on some sides of the road so you don't have to walk 2 km (I would be afraid to walk on a road for at least 2 km, it doesn't seem safe to me)."
100473,2706787,3,Weisenbach,29/04/2023,We used the parking lot to stay overnight. It was very quiet at night. Tomorrow at 7:30 a.m. we drove 2 km further and then parked at the Funicular car park for hikers. The parking lot fills up early. But you can also park along the street. The hiking tour to the village of Bulnes was very beautiful.
100473,2662028,5,jmonsar82,11/04/2023,Quiet comfortable and dream views there is no coverage
100473,2585638,4,aproba,21/02/2023,"Spectacular place, views, surrounded by mountains, 2 km from the Bulnes funicular There is no coverage, uneven spaces in winter, absolute tranquility, we were alone"
100473,2506133,4,Celia.,26/11/2022,"Very good place to spend the night, a little uneven. We spent a very quiet night, it is perfect if you want to do the Cares route the next day. Of course, in that part forget about coverage and the Internet."
100473,2503175,5,hleuaftfher,22/11/2022,Truly gorgeous spot. Stayed here mid November and had the whole place to ourselves. Slightly sloping. Beautiful views. Easily accessible by 6.5m long van. No height barrier. Slept undisturbed.
100473,2485779,5,Vanessa071988,06/11/2022,"Very good place to spend the night if you want to do the Cares Gorge the next day. No services, no bins either. Please take everything with you. There are only a few flat places"
100473,2441621,4,Mathieufardel,13/10/2022,"Super parking lot with an impressive view in the middle of the mountains! Quiet night, and few people in this off-season car park! Very easy to access, I recommend! Only negative point, there are only 5 places where the ground is flat!"
100473,2346997,5,lauraapeltrath,06/09/2022,"Perfect stop before walking the Ruta del Cares. No toilets, but rubbish bins at the entrance of the parking lot"
100473,2345588,5,ricoshay,06/09/2022,"Perfect stopover for the Ruta del Cares, sadly as noted by others, some disrespectful littering but wow, what a stunning location!
Sleep disturbed at 3am by someone in a car, screeching around honking their horn, hopefully not a regular occurrence!"
100473,2336498,4,andre_inacio,03/09/2022,Nice and quiet place for one night. We slpey here before doing La senda del cares.
100473,2327245,5,vieuxjames,01/09/2022,"Very large car park. A little sloping but very practical and in a very beautiful environment. On the other hand, it would be good for people who sleep in their vehicle not equipped with sanitary facilities to think of taking a garbage bag and sawdust to make dry toilets. When you see the parade in the morning there is no mistake about who leaves their human excrement in the edges of roads. It's disgusting and it's very disrespectful for the workers who come to maintain the low sides."
100473,2315957,5,eit026,29/08/2022,"Ample parking. When we arrived at 00:00 there were many motorhomes, but plenty of places to park. Perfect for spending the night before going up to do the Cares route."
100473,2274897,4,Anit23,20/08/2022,"Good place to spend the night, near the routes and in the middle of nature."
100473,2233754,3,elhinchon,14/08/2022,"the place is not bad to spend the night. the incredible thing is how badly people do things... we have seen sewage being emptied in the mountains, meters from a river and in a natural park... the truth is, we deserve not to be allowed to park anywhere. .."
100473,2229965,3,Furgocatt,13/08/2022,Good place to spend a night if you want to do a route in the morning. Very close to Poncebos. Spectacular scenery. But quite uneven and there is no coverage.
100473,2214490,3,Bivouac44,11/08/2022,"Very convenient place to spend a night. Easy to access but relatively sloping. It is possible to park with a motorhome then in the car park at the start of the Cares gorges, by going there early (before 7:30 a.m.)."
100473,2168216,3,PaulaLlorens,03/08/2022,Paved parking with many spaces and beautiful views of the mountains. It has no services and most of the squares are uneven. Very quiet night without noise. Perfect for doing the Cares route or going to Bulnes the next day.
100473,2122793,3,LeaBijaoui,25/07/2022,"It's ok to stop here if you wanna be able to get to the hike early and have a spot to park there (it's only 2km from the parking where the hike starts). The view is beautiful, and it's quiet at night so no problem for sleeping. Apart from that, it's not that good : it smelled like piss really strongly, there were only a couple of spots that were flat, no phone network..."
100473,2022910,3,ISantest,29/06/2022,"Quiet place, most of the squares on a slope. There is a container at the entrance. We were in a small camper in June 2022 and we were barely 10 vehicles spending the night. Pity the smell of urine."
100473,1992836,4,Beapelona,19/06/2022,parking with many places. Perfect for the Cares route or others.
100473,1960179,5,VanlifefamilySweden,08/06/2022,"Amazing spot during low season! It’s a big public parking, but during low season it’s empty and with an magnificent view of the mountains. Close to the start of Ruta del Cares, which is the reason for people coming here, but we took the van to the starting point since it’s still about 2-3 km away. When we slept here only 2 other vans did. Felt like wildcamping ?"
100473,1897731,3,CycyetRiri,18/05/2022,"Very large car park, 2km from Poncebos and the start of the Cares trail. Convenient to spend the night and leave early in the morning to find a place in Poncebos. Very few flat places so provide wedges."
100473,1877554,2,philou47,08/05/2022,"Provide wedges of 10 / 15 cm. No 4G at SFR and Bouygues or telephony. Calm, if you are lucky enough not to have stupid and disrespectful neighbors!"
100473,1826331,4,Davara,16/04/2022,"Very quiet place 2 km from the beginning of the Cares Route and Bulnes road. We recommend arriving in the mid-afternoon, when most cars have left. There are few places to park on the flat."
100473,1826028,4,CarlosVico,16/04/2022,Very quiet and perfect place to do the Cares route. Difficult to find a flat site.
100473,1649924,5,alprpas,17/10/2021,We simply parked to do the Bulnes route. Correct.
100473,1635727,5,frandrago,09/10/2021,"Spend two nights in a row, quite quiet place to sleep and close to poncebos"
100473,1593217,4,Yugular,19/09/2021,"Access is a bit bad and there are few level squares, but we had a very quiet night."
100473,1584726,4,joanainarr,16/09/2021,"Quiet place to spend the night. the central squares are longer, and although they have a bit of an incline it can be easily solved. No coverage. Walking to the beginning of the Cares route there is a half hour"
100473,1554867,3,lbroks,07/09/2021,"Ample parking on a slope, but perfect for leaving the van there and walking up to Poncebos. If you go before 8 in the morning it is better to park upstairs, in the town car park or on the road where the route to Bulnes begins. There are no services, not even garbage cans."
100473,1549598,3,Unicore,05/09/2021,"We spent two fairly quiet nights here, perfect for driving to Poncebos for parking between 7-8am. Most of the parking lot is sloping and we used drive-up wedges without any problems. We spent the first night in heavy rain, but thanks to the asphalt everything was ok. Spectacular view! Unfortunately the place is very heavily littered, the next rubbish bins are in Poncebos."
100473,1537757,2,FernandoFerrandez,01/09/2021,Good for sleeping if you go to Bulnes later. Most of the squares are on a slope. But very dirty and a continuous smell of urine.
100473,1521756,3,Bikercamper,28/08/2021,"Perfect to spend the night before doing the Cares route. The location is beautiful, although the parking lot is not very clean (smell of urine) and there is no coverage."
100473,1513284,2,frankiegoeswild,25/08/2021,Nice view but that's about all. Way too busy parking lot with almost only sloping spots. Busy road where there is still a lot of driving late at night. A shame to spend the night here; there are so many nicer places in picos d'europa.
100473,1482275,4,sofi-a,19/08/2021,"They let us spend the night without any problem ... what more could you ask for? Yes, we can not throw stones on our roof and try to comply with the rules ... simply !! because there are so many @ ceporr @ !!! Even so in the morning, we moved at 7 o'clock to get closer to Poncenbos to walk the next day ... this parking lot is a bit far."
100473,1474757,5,oierbtx,18/08/2021,"The parking lot has a bit of an incline in most of the space, but fine. A quiet place to sleep. Do not even think about moving the vehicle to bring it closer to Poncebos unless you move at 8 AM, there will be no safe place, better to walk."
100473,1392004,5,conductorrafa,01/08/2021,"To do the ideal Cares route, the entrance was bad but a luxury, although there were few Campers to sleep and I got off to Arenas de Cabrales."
100473,1387481,4,anderbal,31/07/2021,Parking with a lot of incline and smell of pee although the views are incredible. Ideal for sleeping and going to the car parks closest to the start of the Cares route early in the morning
100473,1312019,4,tamihami,10/07/2021,"Very nice view! Stood here with several campers for the night. Quiet. Spots slightly oblique. Easy to drive to Poncebos early in the morning (few minutes). You can also walk from here, but it still sticks to the walk quite a bit. Please note: the parking lot at Poncebos is full before 8.30am. There were also people who already spend the night there, but according to the signs that is not allowed."
100473,1207077,4,Ivan74,19/05/2021,"After not being able to sleep in the siding before the tunnel, I came here. Large site and although the squares are normal size, at this time it was empty. The negative is the entrance. It's a steep hill and the big ACs hit the bass to get in and out. The marks on the ground indicate that it did not happen to me alone. For the rest, it is appreciated that they make these large parking lots."
100473,1027732,3,BertaQuesada,05/09/2020,Very uneven but quiet and well located to do the Ruta del Cares the next day.
100473,996079,4,Cao89tx,23/08/2020,"Huge parking lot quite uneven although at both ends you can be fine. We sleep quite a few vans and ACs. There are no services, but sleeping in such a natural setting is a luxury. It is 2 km from Poncebos."
100473,962136,4,rico72,14/08/2020,2 km from the sloping funicular but fine for the day.
100473,946635,5,Chemagan,10/08/2020,"Parking near the Ruta del Care, uneven but quiet to spend the night."
100473,919724,5,victorgv,01/08/2020,"Do not stay overnight in it, just use it to go to Bulnes. The parking lot next to the funicular is filled early. From this here to Bulnes on foot there is an hour and about 45 minutes and just under 9km. The climb is tough but worth it. IT IS SPECTACULAR!"
100473,698199,3,nunue32,20/09/2019,"Convenient parking to explore the surroundings. Not really charming, and the places are not all flat."
100473,670631,5,jom73,31/08/2019,"No problem sleeping, wide area without services and uneven that is solved with chocks, that if next to us there was a strong smell of urine, which as it was raining all night disappeared the next morning."
100473,651539,5,katedave,22/08/2019,"Surrounded by stunning mountains on all sides. Big parking but small area that is flat. not in natural park so no problem to sleep. great for walk ""ruta del cares"" next day. move early as the carpark in poncebos gets full very quickly. we left at 8am and it was already full but no problem to the right of the cablecar."
100473,628162,5,claudiacan,14/08/2019,Fantastic place and no problem to sleep even if it is a natural park. Enjoy !!!
100473,581914,5,bluecvan,28/07/2019,Great place to stay for night. Limited places on even ground.
100473,538817,5,pat030,04/07/2019,"Parking flat on the left, quiet and very nice view of the mountain."
100473,427871,5,meditador,09/02/2019,"You can park for the day, but you CAN NOT SPEND NIGHT. It's part of the National Park and they fine."
100473,392039,5,Linson,12/10/2018,Big car park off the road to Poncebos. Not much of it is flat but we had a great night.
100474,366146,2,METZGER,06/09/2018,"I understand better why the toilet was locked, very late at night young people come to party with music and shouting, if like us you spend the day to visit and wish you rest at night. Continue your journey to a quieter place"
100494,2600199,5,GwaiZola,06/03/2023,Beautiful place to sleep and wake up in the nature. Lots of space
100494,1699641,3,danilo47,28/11/2021,"Not suitable for Womo, very bad road. Nature conservation area! Forbidden to stay overnight, great during the day. Beautiful bay."
100494,1179479,5,MayBri,25/04/2021,"Spectacular, 100% natural place."
100499,3025198,4,PacoSusi,26/07/2023,Good place to park and visit the city. day only. Right on the street below there is another very large parking lot.
100499,2685825,4,Norfri,21/04/2023,Good area to spend the day and visit the city. The floor is sandy but reasonably level with views over the wine areas. Easy access to the city by elevator. We don't sleep here.
100499,1652680,5,Rafikis,19/10/2021,Easy access and super well located to visit the villa. Right next to the elevator with which you reach the town center in 2 min. We did not spend the night.
100499,1591527,4,Mirisanta,19/09/2021,Near a walk that leads to a small lagoon. besieged next to the elevator that leaves you at the gates of the town wall. we have not spent the night. the lovely town.
100499,1202263,4,Consolos,16/05/2021,Quiet place in front of some blocks of flats. 2 minutes from the elevator to go up and visit the town. A little uneven but a great option. We were very comfortable.
100499,1159512,3,Plaeuskadi,28/03/2021,"We have spent two quiet nights. next to the pool bar with swings, tennis court and next to the elevator. some places with a slope but the first ones are not. Highly recommended to see the town, bike the route of the lagoons, see the town of La Hoya and the route of the dolmens"
100499,778403,3,pedrolb76,09/02/2020,Many free places but on slope-slope. Next to the back of the Civil Guard and near the elevator to visit the beautiful old town.
100522,890041,1,Rororous4,22/07/2020,"Not for having slept there you have to climb all the sites, it is a siding (surely private) with an olive tree on a seedy road where hardly a camper and a half fits."
100522,424829,1,Krystalthevan,26/01/2019,Nice view but horrible roads to get to to this spot. We managed somehow with our transit van and one part of the road was blocked with a tree!
100537,2658687,5,danib544,10/04/2023,Good place to spend the night. We got together 4 motorhomes. Very good views. Be careful when entering if you have a long rear overhang. It touched me a bit. Go slow. I finally went in reverse
100537,2145847,5,artazulo,30/07/2022,Quiet area to spend the night
100537,1754008,5,RaulSJ,12/02/2022,"Magnificent place to spend the night. At night no noise is heard, and you have a view of the castle, the town and the spectacular stars, without a doubt a great option to sleep. Fully leveled, and perfect for 7.5m AC"

100537,1436964,5,Karlitos762,10/08/2021,"Good place to visit the castle and spend the night. For the very busy day. The quiet night. We slept next to the cruiser; two ACs enter. At the tourist office they told us that you can also park right next to the crossroads under some trees or on an esplanade near the office. There are no toilets or trash cans, just a trash can."
100537,1336077,5,amigosyluz,18/07/2021,"Beautiful and peaceful place. We travel large, camper (7M+ and trailer) and could easily get there and park. Also nice for children to play."
100537,1297525,5,manel21,05/07/2021,Very quiet night with the views of the illuminated castle. There are several areas to stop: The one of the crucifix before the tourist office and with the paved floor that can fit 2 AC ona of land within the walls and a little above the tourist office. Further better to go on foot

The only inconvenience, to go to the town you have to walk along the road and with a dog it becomes complicated. They reserved a place for me at the end of August. I will be back!"
100640,2333755,5,Saitiko,03/09/2022,"Very nice little campsite. The family takes care of everything very lovingly. We were only shown the place and then we could decide if we wanted to stay. You stand on small terraces and we had a beautiful view of the sea through the trees. However, it is a bit cramped for long vehicles. 20 euros per night 2 people with dog and van without electricity. Gladly again!"

100640,2243827,3,GregMarjo,15/08/2022,"Very clean campsite, but expensive. Clearly you are paying for the geographical position, no swimming pool, varying water temperature, just a bar and bread for breakfast. Full August, a van plus an aunt, two adults, three children, 45€."

If you continue to the interpretation area of the river there is another parking lot and I don't think the train is heard there."
100695,3174472,2,oceeme,18/08/2023,"I don't think it's worth the stress, knowing that 400m away there is another well-signposted apartment (which occupies a dirt soccer field)."

100696,412111,1,apage,05/12/2018,Not a practical overnight stop unless you block a ‘do not block’ access gateway for the only flat spot or like sleeping at a severe angle. Daytime parking is fine however a lot of smashed car glass was there tonight. Short van only if you wanted stay the night on the flat and block the gate access.
100696,390100,3,VanGusto,08/10/2018,"Very sloping parking area, only one place where you stand approximately straight (right next to the garbage cans). We did not feel well and drove on."

100697,2694676,3,surfjah99,24/04/2023,Free parking but not too big. Arrive early to pick a spot.
100697,2659677,2,Wunderkinder,10/04/2023,"So the hike is wonderful, even with children, although mine are very fit for 4 and 7 years. 10 km in total. But the place itself is absolutely not recommended, the path is constantly steep and sometimes narrow here. Lots of rubble and far too little space to park really relaxed here. Thank God we were nearby and only came here by car."
100697,2615263,3,kasparjuvenalis,19/03/2023,"In mid-March we were completely alone here even on a Saturday. Unfortunately, the water level was so high that we had to turn back after 3 km on the way to the lagoons because our dog would not have been able to get across. Theoretically you could have climbed over the rocks if you are fit. Pitch is ok for one night. Kiosk was closed, only one vending machine was open."
100697,2371427,4,ptcarlospt,14/09/2022,I had a problem-free night. Arriving early or late is easier to get a seat for the large AC
100697,2330978,4,GeoDalmis,02/09/2022,"Stood here 2 nights without any problems, each with 1 other camper. Absolutely quiet at night, the first cars for a hike come around 7:30 a.m. Space directly at the bar - good & cheap, clean toilets. Unfortunately, typical residues of campers without a toilet. From here hike to 7 Lagoas and/or circular route. The short way (after the bridge on the right) is quite easy, the longer way has it all. Difficult mountain trail."
100697,2304552,5,park57000,26/08/2022,"Great to spend the night and go for the 1h30 hike to the lagoons the next morning. Arrived around 7:30 p.m., we had room for a 6m van. By arriving a little later it is easier to find a place. Quiet night but great mosquito hunting despite mosquito nets and citronella. The little bar is cheap and also serves sandwiches/burgers."
100697,2099831,4,Sylviebancourt,20/07/2022,Very calm and practical to go in the morning to do the superb hike of the 7 lagoons. We arrived there at the end of the day around 6:30 p.m. and found a place. We were alone to spend the night there. It was nice to do the hike early as we were almost alone in the lagoons leaving around 9am from the parking lot. We had no mosquitoes.

We got there at around 6pm and there was only one spot available so definitely get there as late as possible to go to the lagoons early next morning. The bar is good and it has a restroom on the back you can use. We didn’t hear a single sound all night.
100697,996487,5,rebame,23/08/2020,An ideal place to spend the night and visit Sete Lagoas. It is important to arrive at the end of the afternoon in summer there are usually many cars and little parking. It is recommended to do the complete circuit starting inside the town.
100697,936825,5,mako18,07/08/2020,"Good place to park and to spend the night, very quiet. It has the bar next door (open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.).

100697,710783,4,andrefcferreira,02/10/2019,Peaceful and calm place next to the village. Maybe some land leveling and some trash bins would be pleasant :)

Nice for them to get up and open their shutters on a motorhome... Who would like to have that close to home. And what interest for us? Out of respect for the local residents, do not go there especially since it is without interest"

100786,3042921,3,Pachakutina,29/07/2023,"The campsite is saved by the environment, the spacious and shady pitches and the friendliness of its employees. The guy at the reception gave us a lot of information about routes for mountain biking and hiking in the Sierra Cebollera. Otherwise, services and facilities are very neglected, without maintenance and very poor cleaning. It is the only option in the area, so we imagine that they are not ""urgent"" to improve the quality."
100786,2847792,5,JenniferRuiz,12/06/2023,"Quiet, spacious campsite with spacious pitches and an adapted toilet ♿. A beautiful place, Sierra de Cebollera, which we will visit again without a doubt."

There are many free spaces for games and a swing area for children. The restaurant does not have a great variety but everything is very good and at a very good price. The staff treated us excellently."
100786,2508834,4,UncleBuck,29/11/2022,Closed. 26th November. Did allow us to fill up with water and offered us a shower as we had been shown to our pitch.
100786,2466842,2,travellingfinn,28/10/2022,"Our experience was not the best. Barking dogs and cows with bells roaming freely on the campsite made it impossible to sleep. No internet or cellular coverage, wi-fi only works in a small area by the restaurant. Bathrooms are cleand but not fresh. Lots of old and dirty caravans. Maby It's better in the high season as we were here in late October. The staff was welcoming and place was cheap."
100786,2412636,5,gladils,29/09/2022,"It's a simple and basic campsite, perfect for me! You don't need anything else to be calm in the middle of the Cebollera natural park and be happy. It's also super cheap: I paid €11 a night for me and my mini camper."
100786,2342137,5,andreaRar,05/09/2022,The treatment has been exquisite by the owner. We have not spent the night but we have emptied the gray and black water and filled the water for a very good price. Perfect area to be able to do several routes without having to take the motorhome. 100% recommendable!
100786,2138626,3,Eduardomsmf,28/07/2022,"Camping is ok but basic. The facilities are fine, but quite old, although well maintained. You can use washer and dryer. It has a restaurant that is not bad. The good thing allows dogs and does not charge. The bad thing is that it does not have to empty grays and blacks and fill. It has many options for excursions in the area."

100786,1310580,4,Gaivota,10/07/2021,Very nice place. Not so far you can visit Black Lagoon (6€ entrance ) . I really recommend if you prefer nature than luxury. Ok

In fact, I recommend the one with the waterfalls (trails 3 and 4 according to the map of the area). the campsite is very quiet and those who run it are very friendly. indeed super warm water in the showers, ideal after the walk"
100786,1087475,5,Rouse79,09/10/2020,"Very quiet place to enjoy nature. Cows and sheep pass by, there is a river right next to it and you have several very beautiful hiking trails to do from the same campsite. Very brave water in the showers. Very friendly people."

100787,2330755,5,silvaT3,02/09/2022,"What a pleasant surprise. It was not easy to get a reservation, do it in advance. The Park has very good infrastructure, good plots and many activities. We stayed 3 days and didn't even go to the beach to enjoy the park."
100787,2197598,5,laupej,08/08/2022,"Very large pitches under a pine forest where there is always shade. Activities for children throughout the day and very large pool.

100787,1457852,5,Tibiloutes81,14/08/2021,"Very pleasant and shaded campsite: a swimming pool, a restaurant and a small supermarket. Perfect for a pied-à-terre to visit the island ... if you are looking for a campsite of course. And it is very clean and quiet."

A small supermarket, with the basics. At 0 o'clock it is silence, which is respected and one falls asleep great. Gray water drainage area and clean water filling. Chemical toilet. Three kilometers from the beach of Son Bou."

100792,2900754,3,Slybz,28/06/2023,A lot of people in this period and a lot of passage. A hassle-free night and the immediate proximity to the beach is a real advantage.
100792,2615630,3,tinothevan,19/03/2023,Ok place for one night but there is a lot of noise from the street and few places available. So much coming and going of people who park their cars for a ride on the beach. Certainly not a classic place in nature. I recommend the parking lots further along the coast!
100792,2604885,4,jasocamp,10/03/2023,"The place is super fine, but very uneven in some places (probably washed out by rain or something similar). It's more or less right on the main street. It doesn't bother me at night. Otherwise, the parking space does not necessarily invite you to stay longer"
100792,2596880,4,Eudemobile,03/03/2023,Small car park on the edge of the beach with a few flat spaces. Nice beach with showers. The road passes right by but the noise during the night did not bother.
100792,2471187,4,cb0210,30/10/2022,"We spent two nights here with our motorhome, accessible place, be careful not to go too far because it gives direct access to the beach. More or less clean, flies during the day and mosquitoes at night but nothing unbearable. The road is very close, busy and people drive fast, however the noise did not bother us to sleep."
100792,2424647,4,Belenvillar,05/10/2022,"Quiet place easily accessible if you are careful not to get in the sand, close to the road but not too inconvenient. There is a beautiful dog beach and a very nice beach bar."

100792,2014948,4,Patrali,27/06/2022,"about 120m to the beach. direct sea view from the parking lot. The road doesn't bother us, since there is very little traffic at night. The beach bar is very cute and well shaded. The beach at the sea is fine and white, great for children as it is very flat. With a little air out of the tires or four-wheel drive you can also drive 30m further into the path."
100792,1920583,4,Pascal124,27/05/2022,"Great spot, near the beach. With a 4x4 you can drive a little further to the right. Everything was clean there and the nearby expressway didn't bother us. 4 stars only because there were some ticks in the sand"

100792,1753273,4,distritocamper,11/02/2022,We had a wonderful day here. It has a garbage container and a very nice wooden path to the ideal beach. Perfect to spend the day with your camper.
100792,1742599,4,AbelyLales,28/01/2022,The traffic noise at night is offset by the sunrise on the beach. Ideal walk also if you have a pet since many residents come to this place with them. The beach bar further on is open in January and with great service since it is closer to the road.
100792,1706380,3,BenTxan,08/12/2021,"Comfortable place to enter with camper, views of the beach and showers next to it (in operation). The road that is next to it had a lot of traffic and it is heard a lot and in the area there is an abundance of garbage even with containers and bins."

100792,1625220,2,Corlissa,03/10/2021,"Not a suitable place to spend the night, close to the main road and few paved parking spaces. We went to the place next to this one (parking lot at beach bar) where you have much better and nicer places."

We weren't quite sure if we could spend the night here, but the police just passed by and when we asked they told us that we could spend the night without a problem. We went with a jeep and the bed upstairs."
100792,1370103,4,RaquelM,27/07/2021,We spent one night. We were alone and no problem except some noise from the beach. There is a beach bar and the beach a few meters away.

We spent the night very well but at 9 am the Civil Guard passed by and asked all of us who stayed overnight for their DNI. You can park but not stay overnight. throughout the municipality of Llanes. We don't know if they will fine us. I guess the first one is a warning, there is no prohibition sign"

100849,748665,1,bigarena,30/11/2019,"Horrible. impossible to sleep between the constant noise of trucks coming and going all night. Not difficult in general but 3 hours of sleep being continuously awake, that's a lot. Bar 24h / 24h with clean bathrooms."
100849,695366,5,jaj2018,18/09/2019,"Stayed here 1 night. 24h toilets.
the only shower that is working is the one in the garage. you have to pay inside the garage and they give you the key. its round the back. they speak no English but you are in a que of all the lorry drivers."

100856,2660045,4,carabassa,10/04/2023,unusual place under wind turbines but very quiet. the noise of the wind turbines did not bother us. very few passages to ask how this spot was discovered!

100879,1522422,2,LisvethWoehrer,28/08/2021,"The night was not very quiet for me. From 8 to 12 in the evening young people were there with loud music. Some of them came back around 4 a.m. From 5 to 6:30 they played loud music again, honked the cars and fired fireworks. This is definitely not the case every night. I think I was just unlucky. They didn't go to my van."
100879,1330054,5,SylviaOng,16/07/2021,"This is a perfect spot! It's quiet, pretty flat, NO FLIES, there is a bar around the corner, lovely views, not too high up and more than enough space. I really recommend this area. There are picnic tables, barbeque area, water and wastebins."

100905,965018,5,Perryneta,15/08/2020,"We spent the night of 08/13/2020, very quiet, another van and an AC. When we were leaving, since it was Friday and a holiday on Saturday, more vans and caravans arrived. The natural pool in the parking lot is very good, and others in the surroundings are better :)"

100906,2721626,5,tonysplash,04/05/2023,"Incredible welcome, respectful people. They serve full meals with salad for 16€. Best Paella we have eaten in Spain. Nice swimming pool. 20€ per night without electricity. A haven of peace! Look for the route on google maps and not by Park4Night because we propose a non-existing road. Winding road, honk in the turns."

100906,2554104,5,McHeck,17/01/2023,"Beautiful place and very nice operator. The other campers are all really friendly. If you are looking for peace and quiet, you will find it as well as pleasant conversations. We've been there several times and will definitely be back soon. Please note that the access from the Autovía has some very tight curves and is also steep."
100906,2464453,5,Fruttenking,27/10/2022,Beautiful campsite with lovely people. Great bread and croissants in the morning. Nice hikes around and an amazing pool to swim.

100906,2269714,5,apannitti,19/08/2022,"As a loyal customer it is like a second home. Calm, respect, fun and kindness make you feel at peace. Large, varied and well separated pitches. Swimming pool and common structures reflect Diego's architectural flair (halfway between Gaudì and prehistory); clean services and ample willingness to help. Access road to be done carefully but suitable for all vehicles. Recommended for everyone!"
100906,1908125,4,globetrotter82,22/05/2022,"super campsite, calm, friendliness, nature, all provided by a super friendly team. Only ""grey"" point, the grocery store which in my opinion could get a little richer. But the restaurant is very good. The pitches are very spacious, and scattered in nature, far enough from each other to guarantee a certain intimacy."
100906,1664974,5,ChristopheEtKarine,27/10/2021,"If you are looking for tranquility and wide open spaces then you have come to the right place, out of season this campsite is a haven of peace, the facilities are of very good standards, the sanitary facilities of exemplary cleanliness, the friendly staff all in a frame or buildings seem to come straight out of a book by Jr Tolkien. All for a very reasonable price (-from 25e / night)"
100906,714744,5,beedgee,06/10/2019,"In complete seclusion on a plateau is a small work of art from a campsite for naturists (nudists). Here, the owners have created incredibly beautiful homes and pool area. You can do long walks. The approach a few miles before leads partly through very narrow U turns in canyons. Be sure to honk when you are wider and hear if someone honks"

100926,1274221,1,Abigopi,24/06/2021,"The town is striking because of the fossils on the facades and the museum is totally recommended for €3. But there is almost nowhere to park in the entire nucleus and the soccer field is an esplanade without shade and without any other services. The botanical garden is fenced and gated. There must be a bathroom area with access for vehicles and tables, but we didn't get to go. We went to Serradilla."

Seats marked for vehicles up to six meters, showing a complete lack of knowledge of what a motorhome is, which prevents me from rating this ASA with five stars."

We travel by car + camper.  The staff did not allow us to leave a camper here.  Very little space when leaving.  We have a total length of 8m.  Designed file for passenger cars.
100937,1393311,3,jorgerif,02/08/2021,Parking at the entrance of the border. We paid € 12'60 and spent half a day seeing Gibraltar. Something expensive. You have to be careful with the corners of the eaves of the covered area that are dangerous to leave half a motorhome in them.
100937,1068220,1,danitania,24/09/2020,"It is not worth paying those prices (3.90 euros / hour or 31.20 a full day, having another cheaper parking next to the port with all services and also in a more beautiful area."

Lots of bird song; a goldfinch serenaded us nearby, heard a scrops owl in the evening and a cuckoo in the morning - lovely! 

The landlady wasn't in to pay in the morning,  so we pushed €5 through the a crack in the front door with a note - hope she got it okay."

They let us use the facilities of the hostel, there were showers, washing machine, sink for dishes ... there are two parking areas, if you park in the meadow, be careful that the sprinklers are turned on in the morning. I recommend parking as close as possible to the neighbor's fence. Spectacular site, thank you for giving this service to those of us who are going en route"

100965,1016426,3,Javi_Coyanza,31/08/2020,"The enclosure very beautiful, without disturbances. It is the garden of a restaurant in which owners allow car parking, but nothing is free, they charge € 5 per night without services and whether you make drinks or not. Kindness is not lacking for the owners. They should promote consumption (if you eat / have dinner, stay overnight for free), especially since they do not have supply or emptying services."
