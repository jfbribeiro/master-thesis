21604,1748320,5,SaoirseTheRelayCamper,05/02/2022,Calm spot for overnight. Bins available but no other services. 4g good. Flat spaces. Great for walking along the Via Verde. Gorgeous views of the surrounding countryside.

21604,1051480,3,crisslulu,16/09/2020,"Super quiet place at night, but from 07:00 am a lot of truck traffic."
21604,760594,4,shirley88,31/12/2019,"Great place to stay overnight. Very quiet and next to the beautiful via verde path. The sign on the photo is an advise to use the via verde between sunrise and sunset, so the parking space is also fine for the night! In the morning around 8 the first cars came by, because they perform some maintenance on the via verde a bit further on. Only garbage bins, no other services"
21604,456818,4,devonbird,17/04/2019,Had a super quiet night here surrounded by beautiful countryside. The Via Verde bike track is great. At 6.30 am half a dozen trucks turned up to load up at an adjacent quarry. So make sure when parking to tuck yourself well away from the entrance gates and turning area!
21604,226673,1,wagenblog.org,09/03/2018,This is a day parking lot. Overnight not desired.
21604,220045,4,baloo589,24/01/2018,"We will stop there for a few days to make the green way in both directions, quiet place, easy access"
21604,207368,3,pacodevalencia,29/10/2017,"Sinister the place, not that much. Indeed the old station is not able to accommodate people! But the place is calm, except for some hunters who parade on Sunday mornings."
21604,141286,3,jef33,06/06/2017,Quiet at night. Walk on the superb greenway. Illuminated tunnel. We will come back.
21604,69649,1,lavud,21/04/2016,Quiet but a little sinister ...
21604,37059,3,momo3008,19/05/2015,"Ideal for an evening stage, in a beautiful nature. View of olive groves and Olvera Castle. Parking at the bottom of a dead end street, so very quiet."
21607,3137645,4,manu516,13/08/2023,"A very nice place to stay for a few days, 20 meters from the water of the beach. Very calm and in two days that the state has not told us anything the police. always having a head and not like many that we have seen with tables outside and awning since later we complain that they fine and do not say what they have done. It is far from the town although in the morning a van comes selling ice and bread"
21607,2757047,3,liss876,17/05/2023,"The Guardia Civil told us in the morning that you cannot camp here, only day time parking. They were taking pictures of peoples license plates. There were lots of mosquitos in the evening. Otherwise a great spot, right next to the beach and close to bars. Good spot for daytime parking."
21607,2723581,4,norway18,04/05/2023,"really great to be so close to the beach, only the adjacent street gives a point deduction. Attention deeper sand in some places. Shower when going locally."
21607,2716244,5,HugoMiguel,02/05/2023,"it's just a pity not to have services like evictions and water. weekends crammed. spectacular location, with a free beach shower and as long as common sense is maintained (no camping), it has what you want for a motorhomer who likes to wake up on the beach. even the dog loves this beach. AC Micas do Jaime awards 20 stars"
21607,2704755,5,Wildapple,29/04/2023,"Great parking lot to spend time right at the more. At night you can hear the waves, except when a car drives by (usually very fast). Be careful when parking and look carefully beforehand so that you don't get stuck in the sand. Today at 10:30 the baker came by with a car for sale. Unfortunately, some just leave their rubbish on the beach and go about their business in the forest across the street."
21607,2693776,5,Rollsit,24/04/2023,"great place feet in the sand, shower on the beach. in the top"
21607,2690987,5,GoLaniGo,23/04/2023,5 star hotel location.   Right on the beach  enjoy
21607,2666302,5,crisfera,13/04/2023,"A 10 for this site. Sleeping in front of the sea is a privilege that only we have, so take care of it!"
21607,2634127,5,aanaa_1992,01/04/2023,A perfect place to rest. Beach a few meters away. There is a wooden walk past the beach bar. It is worth going for a walk there. On Sunday it was full but on Monday it was quieter.
21607,2624458,5,anke1980,25/03/2023,"Perfect place, quiet to sleep and few seconds on the beach."
21607,2610443,5,hansenannelies,15/03/2023,Wonderful place right on the beach. Eateries left and right. Now enough space. Clean up your garbage
21607,2582043,5,PHP,18/02/2023,"In winter, few people but a unique spot on a huge beautiful beach. Restaurants nearby but it is good to contemplate the sea!"
21607,2556509,5,uliseszeus,20/01/2023,"It is a fabulous place with good views of the beach, beach bars very close in case you fancy something, many points to throw rubbish. Please let's take care of it, we must take into account that it is a car park and vehicles cannot be placed in any way or camping"
21607,2465375,3,nomadazaca,27/10/2022,"It is a beach parking lot, without services or anything. The good thing is that the beach is there, right in front of it and that is the most pleasant thing."
21607,2462086,1,Gromo,25/10/2022,"Both the beach, dunes and parking lot are incredibly veiled. In the dunes toilet paper and piles. Vanlifer starts to appreciate our environment! Furthermore, there are several clear signs in the parking lot that prohibit campers from staying overnight. We drove on."
21607,2438314,3,lupobianc,11/10/2022,Nice place X to free several campers even if we are in October water and shower in the bar near garbage bins and glass present at 500mt restaurant open
21607,2330927,4,d2clon,02/09/2022,"we don't give it a 5 stars because the road is there, no much traffic but some fast cars passing.

the problem with getting stuck in the sand is mostly in the west part, close to the chiringuito, in the east part the sand is solid 

great parking spot with nice views and access to the beach."
21607,2289298,5,pandorayprome,23/08/2022,"we have been intermittently several nights and ladies and gentlemen make no mistake: overnight is not allowed ANYWHERE. Once this has been clarified, there are areas that are more lax than others in terms of visits by guards or the environment. , and this is one of them: showers, restaurant and sea views. The gorillas do not bother and they are the ones that can tell you if the police have passed or are about to pass."
21607,2286597,1,santi1976,22/08/2022,I don't put a zero because I don't know how. You have to be careful where you park because you can run aground with the sand. full of people who have been standing there for a long time. in the morning it is full of gorillas who ask you if you can leave the area for them. It looks like a slum camp.
21607,2284204,5,brabar,22/08/2022,"Perfect place on the beach, but you can not spend the night. The police have passed by and we have asked and they told us that they come once a month and take photos at night, if you are there the next morning they fine you."
21607,2178269,2,JoseCarlos,05/08/2022,"Civility please. An idyllic site but some dump it all out. Tonight a fine to the song ay goes by the law of coasts (irappealable) prohibited by law from 22.00 to 07.00 hours. (Now you can allege that you drank and could not drive, it doesn't work) Very reliable information motorhome at this time prohibited a fine to the song."
21607,2054202,4,javifP,09/07/2022,"Magnificent place next to the beach, there is no place to empty, it is kept quite clean except for a few unaware. Usually packed to the brim on weekends. This place is worth taking care of"
21607,2052778,5,Orbelinda,09/07/2022,"An incredible place, quiet although very close to the road but a few steps from a fantastic beach."
21607,2035697,5,CynASM,04/07/2022,"Spectacular place. At the foot of the beach. From the parking lot to the center of town, walking is about 5 km along a path that is very good. We had no problem. We recommend it without a doubt"
21607,1996306,3,mralbertoma,20/06/2022,"Near the beach, there are trash can showers and beach bars nearby. Close race, very noisy because cars go by fast."
21607,1883523,1,dmarco,11/05/2022,"the civil guard arrived and took pictures of the license plates, apparently this is in the protected area of the coast, they will come in the morning and whoever is still here will be fined"
21607,1877548,2,javi4x4,08/05/2022,Disrespectful people emptying the waters in the sand. (Then we complain that they ban us) The road gets very smelly after 7 in the morning.
21607,1856637,1,AlexSevilla,27/04/2022,"It was a good place but it is degrading. More and more people disrespectful to the rest: rubbish, noise, biological waste everywhere. A pity that we treat such a beautiful environment in this way. It costs nothing to leave the site as you arrived or better, let's be civil please."
21607,1773932,3,HeinMueckEU,05/03/2022,"The road is not very busy, but cars drive at 80-120km/h just a few meters past parking lots. But there are no barking dogs ;) The sand is very soft in parts, you shouldn't just drive into a gap somewhere in the dark, maybe you won't get out of there again."
21607,1764553,4,zwerfleeuwen,24/02/2022,"Enough space along the entire road to park your camper. Great place, right by the sea. Awesome!"
21607,1749460,4,Vaneton,06/02/2022,"Great place, quite spacious although it is usually always quite crowded, in summer it is difficult to park, very close to the water car parks, but some colleagues with motorhomes and campers are uncivic and very unsupportive, parking the line to the beach and preventing other colleagues from being able to parking, it's embarrassing. Señor@s, we are going to do things well for the benefit of all, thank you"
21607,1743661,1,antonioip,29/01/2022,"Too bad, it's a beautiful place, but people don't park safely, they bother with music and leave garbage. A few years ago this was an idyllic place, now it is a place degraded by disrespectful people."
21607,1743232,1,merlinamoreno,29/01/2022,"I'm embarrassed how people park here. So that we can all live together, we must park on the battery, not parallel to the beach. This is full of hicks who play loud music and leave garbage on the beach."
21607,1694253,4,Ladde,20/11/2021,Very close to the beach and very quiet. There are garbage cans. Well attended even in the off-season.
21607,1624982,4,tieskeheijl,03/10/2021,Great place right on the sea. waste bins and beach shower available and nice beach bars with good food. Police didn't care and it was super busy out of season. top!
21607,1541855,3,wawev81,02/09/2021,Ground parking. Many caravans. The good thing is that the beach is next door. There are two beach bars at the ends of the parking lot. The bike path that goes to Punta Umbría has an entrance.
21607,1536729,5,OPONAMA,01/09/2021,"It is not a place for ac or caravans, it is simply a fairly large parking lot on the beach it is obvious, if the guard passes, they end up fining because it seems that people live there. the place is idyllic and beautiful. It does not have any type of services other than what a normal beach offers. Cold shower and garbage cans. Much uncivil who relieves himself on a dune or between cars."
21607,1534654,3,larosa,31/08/2021,"Nice place, many Campers but there are no services such as toilets or emptying. People go after the pines or straight to more dunes. It's a shame, not everyone is prepared to last several days and it is a bit ugly to see someone piss a few meters from you. Obviously not everyone does that but they are enough. The next morning the Civil Guard passed by, fined and took pictures. Night of 08/29"
21607,1532424,3,Txekar,30/08/2021,"We spent the night of 08/22/2021 and the next morning the Civil Guard took photos to fine anyone who repeated it ... I am not surprised because it seemed that some ""lived"" there and there is no place to drain water ... so you can imagine where they did it."
21607,1512320,4,Djeiser,25/08/2021,Many ACs and campers. Good place to enjoy the beach. There are showers on the beach. Very quiet night.
21607,1506787,3,trillonyotero,24/08/2021,"Good place to spend the night, a lot of dirt"
21607,1475977,1,Gambare,18/08/2021,"Hearing comments like ""there are no services you have to go behind the dune"" bad, very bad."
21607,1470769,5,teoraus,17/08/2021,Cool ocean view! Perfect spot
21607,1466260,4,oskrcali,16/08/2021,A great parking lot right next to the beach. there is a shower and a snack bar. Enjoy the place because I don't think it will last long. It is very crowded at this time with the abuses that we all know.
21607,1465883,4,Campinka,16/08/2021,"Good place to sleep, many campers and motorhomes that make you feel safe. The only bad thing is that it is right on the road and you can hear the cars a lot. There is a beach bar next door. Although it is free, the guys in the parking lot in the morning ask for the will."
21607,1450864,1,patitofeo2,13/08/2021,"The place was beautiful but those beings that litter everything, that relieve themselves by your side, those that drain and make there a smell of ... well. Gentlemen, you cannot spend more than two nights in a place without draining and without emptying the Poti, by God, I was disgusted when someone told me I brought my jugs with water and I won't move from here in a month. € 10 per day."
21607,1449715,4,aioaioaio,13/08/2021,"Lovely site. With many and varied vans, caravans and even people who live there. Two beach bars with the option of whether you consume something, you can use the service. Sad that people use the showers on the beach with soap and passing the road, everyone relieves themselves there ... that was how everything was, very dirty. Please let us be aware."
21607,1438822,4,MrLBRD,11/08/2021,"Very close to the sea, feet in the water. Although there is only one shower for the whole beach it is still very practical. There are a lot of people, a bit noisy. There is no toilet so you have to go behind the dune and it is very dirty; trash, rubbish. We still had a good night's sleep."
21607,1435374,5,abrilou,10/08/2021,Quiet place next to the beach. Ideal for staying overnight and safe.
21607,1425809,5,Laurencefwi,08/08/2021,"Brilliant south facing feet in the sand, shower near the chiringuito. in the evening when everyone is gone, only the motorhomes remain. quiet road a little silted up. very pleasant."
21607,1419878,4,GuioGs,07/08/2021,Beautiful beach and very good beach bar next door. You park on the beach and see a beautiful sunset but in high season it is full of cars. I recommend arriving early
21607,1416727,5,christiancastro,07/08/2021,"Super right on the beach, currently pretty full with mobile homes, campers and others. Be careful in the parking lot so you don't get stuck in the sand. You can hear something from the street next to it, but it was ok for us."
21607,1410982,5,Zur,06/08/2021,Perfect! Large parking lot for motorhomes and vans on the edge of the beach
21607,1408412,4,Beapelona,05/08/2021,Good sleeping area overlooking the beach. Full of caravans but with room. A lady told us that they get fines sometimes but especially if you spend more than one night in a row.
21607,1403325,3,irisluca,04/08/2021,Highly recommended for sleeping overlooking the beach. Quiet only with road noise.
21607,1402414,4,itzulipurdika,04/08/2021,"We spent a quiet night, although the parking lot is near the El Arrecife beach bar (small and simple). The beach is long and sleeping in the first row is priceless (August 2021)"
21607,1396834,4,Marielazzs,02/08/2021,"A large sandy esplanade that can accommodate many camper vehicles. Next to the sea, impressive views, a bit of noise due to the proximity of the road. We went during the week and with no problem in terms of noise from other users. Totally recommended."
21607,1385546,1,Albi.,31/07/2021,"A big disappointment, after going there, they tell us that dogs are not allowed, remove the pet friendly ones because it is false."
21607,1376708,5,LouQ,29/07/2021,I am 50m from the shore I listen to the waves when I sleep a beautiful and quiet place has a beach bar on each side of the embankment the baker comes down the mñn it is incredible to be that good for free.
21607,1318211,1,agueda55,12/07/2021,"A beautiful place, but very battered, a lot of noise, a lot of people staying the night, a lot of dirt, very close to the road ... cars kept passing by. We were on the weekend and maybe that influenced people playing music late and making it up, pissing on the door of our van ... well ... we had a bad night."
21607,1315945,5,Urriella,11/07/2021,"Parking perafayadizu to park with large AC. The sea is a few meters away, making it ideal for reciella cola, enjoying the beach and feeling the foles pela nueche. The dawn is also very quick."
21607,1288598,4,bendec,01/07/2021,Nice quiet place with many mobile homes and right on the beach
21607,1281877,3,faltrike,27/06/2021,"Nice place, but a lot of noise and people, little quiet place."
21607,1280055,1,chiquitin,27/06/2021,"It is an idyllic place but thanks to people who camp in shacks giving an image of shanty towns, relieving themselves in full view of everyone, sleeping on the ground and hanging clotheslines, the truth is a shame, Gentlemen this stains the image of the true caravan, be aware and take care of our environment and our reputation."
21607,1253991,3,fjsg,14/06/2021,"Very good place to take care of it, this weekend it was super collapsed and shanty type, please let's take care of it so as not to run out of it."
21607,1247629,3,Vagarosa,10/06/2021,"Good place to spend the night right in front of the beach, the Guardia Civil passed by and said nothing. The beach and dunes are littered with garbage and dog waste, ACs pouring into the parking lot, trailers disengaging, it looks more like a tent camp. I arrived at night and left early in the morning to a nicer place."
21607,1246290,5,Gustavosoares2005,10/06/2021,Very good to spend the day and night sleeping to the sound of the waves!!!
21607,1240822,5,peterwired,06/06/2021,"Great location, right on the beach. 25 colleagues, but that's fun! Fine cafe restaurants."
21607,1232864,5,snupyacky,03/06/2021,Vanlife paradise. out of season is ideal. sleep in front of the sea and have the whole sea at 50 meters. a boon for nature lovers.
21607,1228801,5,jairo,31/05/2021,"A luxurious place. I think it is not allowed, but it seems that they are permissive with wild camping. Unhooked caravans, barbecues, awnings deployed with their artificial grass, gray on the sand. It did not seem like the appropriate place to rest on the weekend, some colleagues do not respect the rest of others, with music and vans started during the night"
21607,1227545,5,Ireleopardgirl,31/05/2021,Parking located at the foot of the road and with sea views depending on where you find a place. The only problem is that from early on there are people having breakfast and arriving at the beach bars (there are 2). If you are looking for something quiet this is not the place because at night there are also the beach bars open.
21607,1225240,3,eva.84,30/05/2021,"A real shame. The site a past but those who inhabit it are scoundrels. puddles of gray everywhere. authentic base camp. Nobody respects anything not even the neighbors. If the place disappears, ask those who think they own the world to have a motorhome. if we respect we will be respected."
21607,1225232,3,Bense,29/05/2021,"The site is a joy, but sadly I don't know how long it will last. Today 05/29/21 caravans unhooked and with generator started, barbecues, open awnings, cars making groups with central camping. Super saturated. The truth is that little happens to us, we shake hands and we take up the armpit ... I have gone and I have spent the night in another place. If they fine over they will complain ..."
21607,1218505,5,fjsg,26/05/2021,"After having spent two nights, spectacular, right next to the beach sleeping listening to the sea, wonderful beach"
21607,1215895,5,MarinaCaro,24/05/2021,"Wonderful views, you park in front of the beach and sleep listening to the waves is amazing. Too crowded for my taste"
21607,1189457,5,manuelaznalcazar,09/05/2021,"Good parking, stable, has no services. The important thing is that you have the beach one metro and two beach bars next to it. I recommend arriving from 9:00 p.m. so that there are no cars that are going to spend the day on the beach or very early."
21607,1177955,4,PinaColadaLiebe,23/04/2021,"Large, level beach parking lot on firm sand next to the road; Parking with sea view; wonderful, long sandy beach; Traffic also at night, but doesn't bother you; unfortunately a lot of dog poop & rubbish; a lot of coming & going; Guardia Civil passed without stopping"
21607,1169921,5,mattissons,07/04/2021,Very good spot. Beautifully located right on the beach. Loved to walk up to the ocean and to take long walks in the beach. You can hear some noise from the roads at the evening/night but we didn’t get disturbed.
21607,1163336,5,mattissons,01/04/2021,"Very good spot right on the beach! 100% recommend, we stayed for 2 nights and enjoyed to step out from our van and be on the beach. Took long walks in the beach and enjoyed the sunsets and waking up to the sound of the waves. Absolutely loved this place and so far the best free parking we have been at (we didn’t pay 2 euros that I read down below that people did.. we didn’t even knew that before now when we already left and read it here)"
21607,1150594,5,MicSimo,12/03/2021,"Beautiful and very quiet, we only spent one night because unfortunately we had to leave, wake up on the beach and in front of the sea is priceless!"
21607,1150021,5,biancaberger,11/03/2021,"Very nice and clean beach! Between two bars, both open. Stayed 4 nights with no problems. Right on the street, but there is little traffic. During our stay some mobile homes and vans on site."
21607,1138328,5,faberyayo,17/02/2021,Very neat and clean. We have been for 3 nights and had no problems. Good place to wait for the boat to Tenerife.
21607,1125781,4,DomingoBarreno,30/12/2020,"It is one of my favorite places for several reasons, there is a lot of space although in summer it gets saturated, at this time of year it is very good. Next to the beach and having the town of Punta Umbría very close to do the shopping and refueling. The area is between two beach bars and I have to say that this summer they removed the showers from the beach, it is free event in the middle of summer (2 € 24 hours)"
21607,1112914,4,Josecar,06/11/2020,"We were on the Pilar bridge, and the place is quiet, next to the sea. A marvel."
21607,1092331,5,mgonzalezsa,13/10/2020,We really liked this site. It is located at the foot of a beach with a lot of space and clean in which to walk with dogs. There are also two chiringuitos that are very good. Nearby there are routes to do between the pine forests. We were on the bridge of the pillar two nights and we were really good. Recommendable.
21607,1091869,5,juanmat4,13/10/2020,"We spent two nights, together with 3 other motorhomes and without any problem, the only thing the road is a little heard"
21607,1088139,5,pacobeta,10/10/2020,It is wonderfully quiet here and close to the beach
21607,1085431,5,Honkajoki,07/10/2020,"We have spent two very good nights in this place. No service but good to stop, sleep and continue. There is always A / C on site."

21607,1081878,5,DjPalanky,04/10/2020,"Spectacular place, very good to spend the night, at least in low season (10/03/20) I have spent here two nights not in a row and luxurious, no problem nor the police came !!! Recommended 100%"
21607,1076182,4,Eirelau,30/09/2020,"Parking on the beach with sea views. The site is quiet although there is a lot of movement of fishermen who park at the last minute or very early. It is a very pleasant place to spend the night and go to the beach, but around 4 kms. from supermarkets. There is a beach bar right there and another one nearby. If you want to go to Huelva you are only 15 minutes away. The cost is € 2 / 24h. Highly recommended."
21607,1074631,4,sofrasi,29/09/2020,A good place to park the van and enjoy the beach and its beach bars

21607,981203,3,GoiLurretan,19/08/2020,"As mentioned in the previous comments it is a nice place, the beach can be left on the beach without any problem and you have to pay 2 € to be able to park all day. It is close to the bars, where there are toilets and it is possible to walk around the area. Although we were comfortable and comfortable, the parking lot and surroundings are pretty dirty. However, it is a recommended place."

21607,970881,4,AntonioyAna,16/08/2020,"We have been several times in this place, it is on the beach and you only have to pay 2 euros 24H. If I had a water point and discharge, I would give it 5 stars. Chiringuitos next to the parking lot."
21607,967819,1,Gorbeia91,15/08/2020,We spent two nights there. The place is fine but because it is next to the road there is car noise at night. Anyway we wouldn’t recommend it because they even stole the solar panel from us.
21607,954902,5,LRamos,12/08/2020,"Very good! At the foot of a spectacular beach, it is flat and the dirt / sand floor does not make dust. Paid parking area, but only 2 € / 24h. It has no services, but some beach bars / rest."

21607,932609,4,TORVENTO,05/08/2020,"For 2 euros, 24 h. If you are lucky you can park overlooking the sea. The bad thing is that there is a lot of noise until 2 or 3 in the morning during the week, the weekend will be worse. But you can park and stay there as usual, there were rumors that it would change this summer."
21607,920170,4,Gitanio,02/08/2020,"Enough noise at night, PLEASE, WE WILL ROTATE, WE MUST LET OTHERS ENJOY THESE SITES. It is not worth spending 20 days like the one with an apartment on the beach."
21607,917945,3,Nivaldo,01/08/2020,"Very good and quiet place to stay overnight. There are no showers and the toilets are for users of beach cafes. Pay yourself € 2 to be 24 hours. Place with few shadows to stay during the day, and become complicated due to high traffic."
21607,908646,4,madeinroadvan,29/07/2020,"It is very good, now in August it costs 2 € 24H with the parkimeter, there is daytime surveillance, several Campers and ACS."

They informed us that they will prohibit the ac, while we were there were no problems and there were several ac and campers more. A great place 10 min bike from Punta Umbría. Without services."
21607,897304,4,Pipa1303,25/07/2020,"Parking costs € 2, there is enough space but most of it is occupied by caravans. It is better to arrive early to get a good place with views towards the sea. We slept without problems and everything was great. The showers are closed due to the COVID issue."
21607,897166,4,Estersanzp,25/07/2020,"The site is very good. Calmer during the week, very busy weekend. Depending on the time you go there may not be parking. In some areas there is a lot of sand, you can get stuck. 2 euros_24 hours."

21607,888730,3,Valencianoisla,22/07/2020,"Very good place, but we have arrived today and the city hall has just put a red zone, you pay € 2 all day, but the person in charge of the area has told us that they do not want caravans to be parked. A shame on the part of the city council, every day we are less free to be able to enjoy our nation and everything so that a few make money at the expense of citizens."
21607,883943,5,magalimourad,20/07/2020,Spectacular parking area. It is good to arrive early or late. On the beach. We will be back.
21607,883311,4,Khalid82,20/07/2020,Nice place to spend the night. We only understood that the showers have now been removed at the request of the community. In the summer it is best to go very early or late because of the crowds of beach visitors.
21607,881841,5,Nie.nie,19/07/2020,"A marvel. We found it by chance. Quiet on the beach and road, you can hear cars passing by early at night but little. There are caravans and campers. Brilliant. We will repeat."

21607,852326,3,amilpin080,06/07/2020,"The site is spectacular on the 1st line of the beach, although there is no nearby place to empty and load water. We have spent 2 nights parked without problems. There were some camped caravans, and some cars pulled up to the awning. There were more than 50 caravans and motorhomes. mosquitoes at nightfall. By day it is full of vehicles and it is a bit chaotic."
21607,844955,4,pamana80,02/07/2020,"We were there for two nights, very good. The road noise is somewhat annoying, but the place on the beachfront is well worth it. No problems to spend the night. There are even camping caravans."

21607,794762,5,nastasjasimontennstedt,12/03/2020,"Very safe parking. We spent one night there, very peaceful. The waves still make a little noise, and some people drive fast on the road which is 5m away (maybe also pcq we have a VW T5 California, and we hear everything through the screen) but otherwise nothing to complain about. Restrooms in restaurants, and showers on the beach. Obviously beautiful sunset!"
21607,791498,4,jlabeille,05/03/2020,"A nice place where you really stand directly on the beach. However, it was already extremely crowded in February and the beach also seems to be a very popular destination for the locals. So definitely not a hidden spot but it's still worth it."
21607,791081,5,lottedi,05/03/2020,"Wonderful place for people and dogs. No dog prohibition signs on the beach, view of the sea, very quiet, garbage disposal possible, beach clean"

21607,716230,5,laetitiadiaz,08/10/2019,Amazing place. The police went through the night and said nothing. Last weekend there were motorhomes emptying dirty water and urinating outside the motorhome ... we should learn to be more civic if we want to continue enjoying these sites
21607,696903,5,joshnick1190,19/09/2019,"Very nice and quiet place. The sea directly behind the dunes. Be careful when shunting, put on some sand loose. Stand there one night alone, in the morning some fishermen come."

21607,673503,5,argomez,02/09/2019,"We have spent two nights and it is a fantastic place, on the beach. It is just a parking lot without any service for ACs."

21607,634512,4,SeilaVillar,16/08/2019,We read a comment that advised against it by people who were there continuously and robberies. We did not have any problem. We parked next to the beach bar and there was a watchman at night.
21607,623627,3,Kixkur2,13/08/2019,"Land parking on one side the road and the beach on the other, quiet night, beach bar with delicious food, without services for the AC, is not an area but perfect for 2 nights."
21607,614742,1,machuca,10/08/2019,Careful there are many people known around here some theft can always fall through the windows. It is a place flooded with caravans and motorhomes that are spent here throughout the summer season have no respect with anything with people so it does not surprise me that every year we have more problems to enjoy our motorhomes I find it a shame what is mounted here. I am a motorhome
21607,612794,4,Mlena,09/08/2019,Little space in the summer.

21607,520715,4,Manuelyfamilia,19/06/2019,I'm with Javiergut. It is a great place to stay a few days. Let's take care of it and it will last us without problems. By proximity the tables and chairs can be placed on the beach and thus avoid problems of legality.

21625,2175507,5,Ain123,04/08/2022,A 10! The owner very attentive. It has a removable pool that saves you from the heat. Quite quiet to sleep. Stone squares of about 30m2 with light Very highly recommended
21625,2164745,4,isabelleJ,02/08/2022,"Super clean place and good equipment, with the swimming pool and the bar it feels more like a small campsite. Location a little small but only negative point. Good value for money and everything you need in the nearby village. path for l'Escala by bike."
21625,2096273,2,Remmie,20/07/2022,"Nice place! But what I think is a big disadvantage is that there is no hot water for washing dishes. And that you have to pay 1 euro to shower is also not really of this time. Even if you want to take a cold shower, this is not possible! MTB is not possible, because of the drought you are not allowed to enter the forest. The fines are high! But just to be clear, the motorhome can do nothing about it."
21625,2038794,4,525JRS,04/07/2022,Fantastic place in a beautiful area! All comforts and amenities are available. Feel free to look at the Instagram of the CP for beautiful photos.
21625,2009431,4,Yokidoki,25/06/2022,"We have slept 1 night during the week. For an AC area, it is very complete. Good points: - shaded pool and picnic tables ❤️ - quiet area, on the outskirts of a small town, surrounded by countryside - small area, not very crowded - recycling bins Bad points: - depending on the wind direction, it sometimes arrives strong smell of a livestock farm Conclusion: we will repeat!"
21625,2004806,5,TomODonnell,23/06/2022,"Lovely spot, and much better than the other paid spot a few minutes away that we pulled up to which had no shade at all.

The owner was very nice and helpful. 

The spot with BBQ and camp tables was great and we worked from there easily, using the pool to cool off in the heatwave we were there for.

€1 to use the shower and coffee machine in the office. Facilities in good   clean condition."
21625,1944110,2,Knappin,04/06/2022,"For the price too small pitches, you have to use electricity (5 euros), even if you don't use it, very strange... like so much here in Catalonia."
21625,1898557,5,Reinhard52,18/05/2022,A pitch that offers more than usual at a very fair price! There is a lot to discover in the area and the sea is not far either! The owners are friendly and helpful! I've been here a total of 4 times since 2019 and it's always been enjoyable!

21625,1861598,5,jeanmarc530,30/04/2022,The services are more than correct for the price charged. The pitches are a little cramped for the 7.50 m units. Hot water in the dishwashing sinks would be a plus. Good location for beautiful walks in the park.

The owner also speaks English. Washer and dryer together cost 9 euros, both are getting on in years, like the rest of the system. It's basically OK, but I don't understand the euphoria of the other reviewers."

We were the last ones leaving today and were offered help, in case we wouldn‘t find a place to stay the next days.

It takes 9 km to go to the beach but by motorhome we have no real choice since it is impossible in the high season to bivouac or even park everything is forbidden ... and campsites take us for pumps to money!

What we did not like at all is that the bathrooms are together with the showers, that is, there are only 3 booths where each one will wash you, shower and sink. And in addition to showering you have to put € 1 for water to go for 8min, it is not enough with the money you have paid for the area. In our case above all we have left without taking a shower and putting the euro as the hot water did not work. Too bad for showers-WC because the rest is ideal."

This year the natural pools have no water. The parking lot has to drain gray water and to fill water, with a 1/2 thread tap. Highly recommended site."
21636,964792,5,dekapax,15/08/2020,A perfect area with filling and emptying and although it is shared with cars they do not say anything if when you arrive the seats in ac are occupied and you occupy the car seats thanks to the city council

We were all day, we walked through its streets, the religious monuments closed ??. Roman bridge, many pilgrims, and ... What is important: good establishments where you can taste its fine cuisine and, we did so."
21636,670133,5,padraigl,31/08/2019,"This is a large carpark with 5 dedicated parking spaces for motorhomes beside the timber fence eventhough some motorhomes park around the trees in the carpark for shade. 3 or 4 of the motorhome places are in full shade in the evenings due to the tall trees.

There are full services excluding electricity.
The grey waste is a normal ground drain.
The black WC drain is 500mm off the ground with a cover and it's own press button tap. The drain pipe with a grid is large but it tends to splash about a bit when emptying the cassette. The grid can gather items and there is a stick to help clean the grid.
The fresh water push button tap is a small screw-on connection opposite the black WC tap and drain.
There are large bins in the carpark.

This is a Camino town and you will see plenty of weary pilgrims around the village. If you get talking to them they have very interesting stories. There is a small shop for fresh bread and plenty of cafe/restaurants in the village. Some restaurants require a pilgrim passport for the cheaper menu. We had a nice menu in Meson el Palacio for €11.

The local river is used as a swimming pool beside the Roman bridge which is very refreshing to swim in. Wear beach shoes as the stone are slippery.
We completed a 3hr30 hiking circuit that is advertised just past the church or in the tourist office. It's recommended as easy but there are challenging uphill/downhill parts. But it's a lovely walk.

**Be aware. We drove through the village Riego de Ambros to get here. There are height restrictions signs of 3m before the village but we are 3.1m and we got through carefully.  The village has a narrow street and low balconies..

We had 3 lovely nights here and highly recommend this Aire and village."

21636,422543,1,Charroknaus,14/01/2019,"The parking lot looked good, pity that some hooligans hit us the car and they even threw us apples. They did not leave us alone and the Civil Guard had to go.

21654,3239182,4,PedroMM,30/08/2023,"Good place to visit the city and sleep. We arrived almost at midnight and there were many people in the surrounding park taking use of the fresh breeze. After midnight it was quiet and we slept with the windows open.
It was a weekday, so I suppose it was quieter because of that.
No shadows."

I have to drive 8 hours and I hardly slept."

21654,3102422,5,Irerozas,08/08/2023,"Great motorhome area, quite flat with a park on the edge of the Guadiana river, great if you go with children and if not, very nice too.

21654,2960797,3,campersitos,14/07/2023,The site as such OK. We were looking all over Badajoz for places to sleep and this was the best. The bad thing is that you cannot do “camper life” (dinner or put things outside) because camping is not allowed. For motorhomes it is perfect. There is free water. It is close to a park and a bar.

The only drawback that I put is that it does not have shade and being in Badajoz in summer without shade can be crazy. We are hot but it is what it is. The squares have a small inclination so you have to use less wedges in the upper ones."

21654,2787099,4,cathy-alain,26/05/2023,"Although this car park is a bit noisy, it has the merit of existing and being free. Many thanks to the municipality. Perfectly located for tourism, it has gray and black water drains, drinking water filling."
21654,2783309,4,SantiFuentes,24/05/2023,It's a great area. Thank Badajoz. It is in a very nice location. A beautiful park and a bar in the park. From there you cross the bridge and go to the historic center for a nice walk. We loved it.
21654,2782751,4,Marina.44,24/05/2023,"Well located area to see the city, next to a park. Very nice. The area somewhat inclined, almost all the vehicles had chocks."
21654,2747350,4,CesariomMF,13/05/2023,"Well located, although small but still good that it exists. Provides the essentials to visit the city. I wish there was the same here. Thank you Badajoz"
21654,2703621,3,Conpa,28/04/2023,"The place is easily accessible, the services are good. but to sleep from Thursday to Sunday I do not recommend it, the music from the bars on the other side of the Guadiana, were at full blast until 02:00 AM."
21654,2698519,3,kanda,26/04/2023,"Totally full Monday 24/04 at 1pm. Very close parking, not flat, very severe rules about levelling ! Water & waste working, thank you. Would not wish to pay except for water/waste."
21654,2688668,4,Severiano,22/04/2023,"There is when it is paid as they say it would be for January 1, 2024."

21654,2669537,4,mm-bs,14/04/2023,very nice paved place. Max vehicle length approx. 7.50 mtr incl. bike rack. Heavy ships find no place here and have to dodge. just walk over the footbridge and you are already in the city.
21654,2665946,3,susalafer,12/04/2023,"Well located area, fulfills its function, it has become small since it is in high demand and is always full. Thank you very much to the city council for taking us into account"
21654,2660166,4,isdalu,10/04/2023,"The area has services for filling and emptying water and cleaning sewage. Everything quite well maintained and clean. We must thank the town hall for facilities located very close to the historic center and well maintained. The only problem is that it is too small for a city like Badajoz. Next to the area there is a large park on the river bank that allows sports activities (bicycle, running, etc.)."
21654,2658036,5,JABUINPA,10/04/2023,"A small area but with an excellent location next to the park that runs parallel to the river, ideal for walking, riding a bike, playing sports or taking pets out. And it also has a bar open from 9 in the morning. better impossible"
21654,2650713,4,alexandrearmez,08/04/2023,"Boa Asa, with discharges and water services very busy, but limited in terms of places. very good location"
21654,2644964,4,Parola,06/04/2023,"Hello. When I arrived there was no space and I parked in the access to the garages. A flat place vacated and I went there. There was a faint noise from the bars across the river. Police control to provide even greater security, in a well located and safe space. The location is superb, with access to the historic center via the Palma bridge. I went."
21654,2643091,1,PattiDavi,06/04/2023,"Last night, Wednesday, loud music until 4.30 from the clubs across the river. 6 hours non-stop of pounding music. With all the good will, I could not close an eye to the noise. TERRIFYING!"
21654,2639777,3,MiguelAmador,04/04/2023,"Well located park, but very popular, so there are no places available. I didn't understand the electricity service. The solution is to use an adjoining parking lot located at the back of some garages, but entry cannot be done through the ASA because there is a prohibited sign."
21654,2636144,4,galerna_van,02/04/2023,"It is very well located, with direct entrance to the river park and a bar with a terrace overlooking the bridge. It has emptying and filling. Only 20 places, at night difficult to find a space, in the morning there were 2 free places. We parked on a street that only gives access to garages and is attached to the parking lot. Noisy Saturday night but we felt safe."
21654,2634520,3,ISALU7,02/04/2023,"Small, not flat, always full but convenient for services and the historic center."
21654,2630098,5,emgc73,29/03/2023,"Motorhome parking very clean and with gray discharge and toilet emptying and clean water recharge. Located next to a beautiful park, which also has a bar, excellent view of the bridge."
21654,2626156,2,KLEINMichel,27/03/2023,Places for motorhomes that I did not appreciate at all after Access is complicated you have to go through a forbidden way The parking lot of twenty places everything is on a slope The places are very narrow and the maneuver complicated Very badly designed Possibilities Emptying And filling
21654,2621615,5,LivingInLuna,23/03/2023,"One of the gems…. The city is the most beautiful you will ever see…. The castle is all free and the old town is incredible!! The site was free spaces at around 10:00am, it did fill up and some were parked on the access road, but hey we are all after the same thing? Would highly recommend this one"
21654,2611959,5,wirsinddannmalaufreisen,16/03/2023,Good quiet place. V+E. Quick way to the old town via the pedestrian bridge.
21654,2609006,3,TraianVoineagu,14/03/2023,one word: crowded! came twice but there aren't spaces available. you can empty and fill up and park nearby at the construction site (entrance via NH Gran Hotel). a lot more space available
21654,2607889,5,Mariolan,13/03/2023,"Good area, close to green areas, and a step away from the center by crossing the historic bridge, 10 min., somewhat uneven and without shade, quite in demand, thanks to the city of Badajoz"

21654,2597357,5,La_Oceana,03/03/2023,"A very quiet area, we spent four great days there. Badajoz is a fascinating city that is very easy to get around and very welcoming, the museums are free and the cakes from the Santa Ana convent to take away your senses. The river park facilitates a good walk to enjoy the afternoon. Thanks to the Badajoz City Council for taking care of their city and the services for motorhomes."
21654,2587837,2,KEPJG,23/02/2023,Sloping and very crowded. Water and waste etc all in place. Inconsiderate and selfish parking in the access road (assumably because people can’t accept that the place is full) prevented us taking the only free space. We were worried about our vehicle being hit so we didn’t stay.
21654,2580596,4,claudioantonio,17/02/2023,"I really liked the place, good location and with some services, a bit crowded but good, being carnivals, it's normal"
21654,2579771,3,ElVeterano,16/02/2023,"A decent enough aire but too far from town and during carnival month woefully too small. Absolutely rammed full today and at least 10 other campers parked on the streets surrounding. We could not even park, let alone stay. But thanks to the town for the facility."
21654,2578816,3,rolfwomo,15/02/2023,"Drain, absorb water ok! Spend the night?? Only for those who don't mind standing together like sardines in a can. Some quiet, large places can be found on Isla de Los Monos. Admittedly, the access road leads to bad roads."
21654,2578118,4,AzucenaCampo,14/02/2023,Great space next to the river. We spent 4 great days without any problem. Highly recommended. Many colleagues and you make friends.

21654,2577512,5,dikihotch,14/02/2023,"good location but no places to park. unfortunately, as in many cities, motorhomes stay for a long time and do not allow others to stay at least one night and visit this beautiful city. we slept on the adjoining dirt court. the area is clean. thanks to the municipality"

21654,2549027,4,bkb,11/01/2023,Perfect location on the banks of the Rio Guadania to visit Badajoz. You just have to cross the Puente de Palmas to find yourself in the old town. All services except electricity. Sorting bins. Very quiet night.
21654,2548897,5,Pretorianos,11/01/2023,"Very quiet to sleep without restriction of nights next to the pedestrian bridge and park, near cafeterias with very varied breakfasts to put on toast and the typical Extremaduran crumbs"

To make an extra note... You don't need water, nor discharge it. In 18 hours I walked from Portugal. Thank you Badajoz for this free area."
21654,2511826,3,rafagonzalo,03/12/2022,"Thank you Badajoz for the area. Wide squares with unevenness that can be solved with wedges.

21654,2497221,2,77francois,16/11/2022,good for visiting the city but little free space because motorhomes from a concessionaire were stored

On the banks of the river, recreation area to walk, run or ride a bike. 20 spaces that fill up quickly, not to mention that there are parked rental motorhomes that occupy a space with no residents inside. Kiosk 20 m away for coffee or beer. Site traveled by pedestrians and cars."

Quiet environment. Get there early because it fills up fast. Small unevenness that is solved with chocks."
21654,2465372,5,Valezingaro,27/10/2022,"visited several times, it is really very beautiful, it is a pity that a camper rental company uses it to keep its rental campers parked, so there are fewer important parking places, I hope that the municipal administration will make them move them."
21654,2463881,4,zulzul,26/10/2022,"Good area, excellent situation to visit the city. The services are quite comfortable. The only drawback is that most of the squares are uneven. Many thanks to the city of Badajoz for facilitating our stay."

21654,2452895,4,paulandjane,20/10/2022,"We arrived at around 3pm and there was one space left, right next to the waste and water facility. The motorhome area is away from the main road, close to the river and a big park.  It's a 10-15 minute walk across the pedestrian bridge into the town centre.  It's a clean and tidy site with big spaces and we felt safe here.  It was quite noisy as other campers were leaving fairly early."
21654,2436923,5,bullginas,11/10/2022,"The park located in front of the area is one of the 3 most beautiful in Spain, according to what they say, and of course, it is beautiful and very well cared for, including a park for dogs. Going up the avenue that starts from the large roundabout through which you enter the area there are many shops. We have been during the week and at night absolute silence. Thanks for this area!"
21654,2434462,3,chrimilitole,09/10/2022,The specified parking space was fully occupied. We were able to park on the adjacent dirt space next to the sports field. Located near the beautiful pedestrian bridge into town.
21654,2433123,4,tyrion,09/10/2022,The area is very nice and located next to an idyllic park next to the Guadiana. Crossing the bridge you reach the center. It's a shame they didn't plan for electricity outlets even if it was for a fee and some public toilets since the ones there belong to a snack bar
21654,2409148,4,Isobuzz,28/09/2022,"Parking very well located on the edge of a park allowing you to do your sport and walk your dog there (you will even find a dog park at the other end of the park). 10 minutes walk from the city center to visit the old town. Services are clean. Only downside, the air is small so come early to get a seat. Another point to underline, the police come regularly to check the CC papers but if everything is in order no worries."
21654,2402692,3,joleen1,25/09/2022,"Fab location, plenty walking & close to city BUT disco thuds until 3am both nights we were there on a weekend"

It was almost full, better not to arrive at the last minute, although it will depend on the seasons. We didn't use the restrooms but everything was clean and well maintained. Shims are necessary. Next to the bridge to cross to the historic center and enjoy it. A luxury that the city takes care of offering such a place for this type of visit. Grateful!"

21654,2303758,3,khalcobo,26/08/2022,"The area is good in general. Emptying and filling comfortable and a park bordering with geese and a bar. On the other hand, it is better to take the upper part because it is downhill and in the morning there is a lot of noise in general. In addition, in the evening the area is filled with cars of people who go to the park to spend the afternoon."
21654,2293848,3,ElviraCastro,24/08/2022,Immensely grateful to the municipality of Badajoz for giving this place for motorhomes with their services.

21654,2055208,4,Maleka1412,09/07/2022,"Very basic, but simple, in a very good area next to the park and the river. Just 5-10 minutes on foot you have a main street with various shops and services."
21654,2028778,4,LuisFranco,02/07/2022,"Very good, with wonderful gardens that combine with the practice of sports. I strongly advise. Not only the noise of the bars on the other side of the river."
21654,2024200,5,FiatDucato94,30/06/2022,Stood here with our VW T5 for one night (25.6.-26.6.22). Free service station. trash can available. Good internet reception. Right next to a beautiful park with a river.
21654,2008889,5,SamYates,25/06/2022,"Stayed last night, well situated for town centre (just go across bridge). Fresh water, black and grey emptying free of charge. Right next to a massive park and river."
21654,1999992,5,desirealaminos,22/06/2022,very good place to visit the city and sleep. We had to stay several days because of the bad dogs and we found a vet and the stay was pleasant. Many thanks to Badajoz for making this place available!
21654,1995743,4,subito-25,20/06/2022,The place is not bad: close to the center with all services. The city doesn't offer much. Have you seen more interesting cities in Spain? The restaurants only open at 8:30 p.m. We ate in the camper.
21654,1972681,5,anne.saive220262,13/06/2022,Free area with services very well located for visiting the old town on the other side of the bridge. No shade in the parking lot. Fortunately located close to a park and the promenade along the river to cool down. We spent a quiet night there. Thanks to the Municipality of Badajoz.
21654,1966506,4,gamma1,11/06/2022,Very convenient place to stay. Easy to walk into the old city.  There were still spaces available until 10pm at night.  You can walk the castle walls and see the repairs after the siege by the British in 1812. There is a park with a cafe/bar a few yards from the aire down by the river with very friendly staff.
21654,1940020,4,Aloys52686,02/06/2022,"Nicely laid out. Spacious pitches on flat astvalt. Tap water and discharge everything. Quiet neighborhood. 15 min walk to the center via the bridge. Has beautiful things but also a lot of ""faded glory"""
21654,1934486,4,didougisou,31/05/2022,"Very well located area with all services. Only 4 CC when we arrived on a Tuesday around 3 p.m. so several spaces available. Certainly an asphalt parking lot without shade side by side but directly overlooks a magnificent park (which we do not see on the photos provided) which gives all its appeal to the place, possibility of lounging under the trees, on a bench.. Picnic .. With even a bar."
21654,1933877,4,Malvern59,31/05/2022,"Location is perfect for visiting city we arrived at 1pm and it was not busy,  walk over bridge to historic city quiet night"

21654,1845832,5,SerendipitousNomads,22/04/2022,"Great spot under the medieval bridge. Nearby Cafe and park along the river. Some places sloped. Unfortunately, not enough spots! we arrived at 17hr and had to park along the shoulder of the road. Every night, at least 10 vans more than capacity had to do the same. Friday and Saturday nights are noisy."
21654,1841108,4,aiportela,20/04/2022,"Exceptional location right next to a green park great for walking. Attention very crowded beware late arrivals, difficult place."
21654,1838228,4,Sin.deentrega,19/04/2022,"Pretty good if not very good. Some defect, such as uneven squares. We were lucky to find a place, many others had to leave or wait to see if we were lucky and someone left. Like everything, it can always be improved. Thanks to the municipality of Badajoz"
21654,1832970,5,leiremclouis,17/04/2022,"Small area, although in the morning there are usually free places. Very comfortable emptying and filling area. Although right next to it there is a gravel road that can also be parked."
21654,1826242,5,joseyoa,16/04/2022,Very good quiet area and very close to the city to visit its monuments a 10 for this initiative to our tourism.
21654,1819705,4,pozilun,13/04/2022,the area itself is very good and very easy to park and unpark. as well as emptying and filling water. the bad thing is that it was full when we arrived and we left next to a gravel parking lot. the night quite calm. because all the water fill faucets have to fix it a bit.
21654,1819004,2,Philleas45,13/04/2022,"The Park was full, we stay on the gravel, outside the Park, sleep very well, we dont use the services"
21654,1814863,2,callajo,11/04/2022,"saturated and small site turned over more motorhomes than those that were parked here, very small for this city, they have abandoned our sector."
21654,1814709,4,baikal,11/04/2022,"Very well located area in a beautiful and cheerful city, but it has become too small. We had to park outside the compound. Somewhat noisy."
21654,1810661,1,CamperSas24,08/04/2022,"The smell is quite horrible, felt like a dumpsite,  people have set up  camp and stay there for longer periods of time. Didn’t feel the vibe. Left!!!!!!!"
21654,1808141,3,Macanudo,06/04/2022,Very nice to visit the city. Some spots are a little sloping. Silence at night.
21654,1806592,3,pticlod,04/04/2022,overloaded area. some locals play suckers. very small pitches. the services are correct and clean. very good for visiting the city and that's it.
21654,1793252,4,PacoSampedro,24/03/2022,"Near the center, it is very good to visit the city. Many squares and somewhat inclined. We only use it to change waters and visit Badajoz. It is appreciated to have areas that allow you to visit the cities."
21654,1779186,1,pinfriedvt,10/03/2022,"The city is worth seeing, but at least 4 stars. The parking space at most 1 star due to the lack of space and the insufficient distance to the neighbors. This is pure ""cuddly camping"". Then fewer pitches with more pitch quality"
21654,1776565,3,dupi24,07/03/2022,"Practical, close to the city (which we did not find very pretty…) on top of each other. Free"
21654,1774237,5,Nandoxx,05/03/2022,An exceptional public area for its location and its services. Super accessible and comfortable face and liquid discharge area. Good seats. We arrived this Thursday at 8:00 p.m. and it was completely gray. There is an unpaved road next to it that can be used if there is no free space. We were lucky and immediately a motorhome came out and we were able to take its place.
21654,1760982,4,distritocamper,20/02/2022,"Small area, but it fulfills its function to empty and fill water; It is in front of a very nice park to walk; although we only use it as a base to go out and explore the city crossing its Roman bridge. We did not spend the night. Non-level seats."
21654,1760382,4,IFlor,19/02/2022,"meets objective, well located. a circuit for walking and running and a fantastic park, with many sports tracks and a dog area. fantastic to change waters... there are only 4 ""flat"" spaces, these are on a transverse slope... I have doubts that with my chocks I would be able to level my motorhome There are not many services (supermarkets) nearby. IT IS NOT ""the best area in Spain"""
21654,1757644,4,Chrissis58,16/02/2022,"a good place, but crowded! by evening it is full."
21654,1757411,4,domkath,16/02/2022,"well placed to visit the city but very small, you have to arrive early! moreover the dump is too close to the cc."

21654,1748927,5,FamilyCTAC,06/02/2022,"We have spent two nights here and perfect! Area with water and emptying of gray water, with few places to be honest, it hurts to be all the places occupied, although there is a lot of turnover! A perfect place to be able to do tourism, pedestrian bridge at the door to the center... everything very very close! The noise from the bars on the other side of the river...you can hardly hear it, so quiet nights!"
21654,1747649,5,wikingo6,04/02/2022,"A nice place. Nice city, quiet at night. Thanks to the authorities for this offer."
21654,1741906,1,Anja71,26/01/2022,Attention. Someone stole our camper stairs during the daylight while we were inside. We think he used to hurry to jump off the wall because the next to the motorhome there are traces of the broken fasade.
21654,1735504,4,martareist,16/01/2022,You are right in the middle of a park! This can make it louder at night. But that's obvious when you park in a city :)
21654,1732267,4,Juanangarcia,11/01/2022,"Very well located area 10 minutes from downtown. Very wide and level squares, the place is ideal next to the river. To put one downside is that the black drain tap is going pretty bad"
21654,1729706,5,mileo2020,08/01/2022,Great place. Center of Badajoz is almost a 10-minute walk away. Park nearby is nice for walking and there is also a cafe near the motorhome.
21654,1724444,4,Morcin,03/01/2022,"the location is very good, a bit noisy, some shade would be needed and the squares a little bigger, the services well, I hope they put more areas in other parts"

21654,1712935,4,DandLtravels,20/12/2021,"Excellent site, close to centre, pretty flat. Thank you City of Badajoz. Would be great if this initiative was copied elsewhere in Europe and the UK."
21654,1712324,3,Tracey-jo,19/12/2021,"Large, not quite flat area with grey/black waste disposal. Unfortunately it sits directly across the river from a club, expect LOUD until midnight Friday and 5am Sunday morning..
Great spot to see the city though"
21654,1712218,3,joselitogutierrez666,18/12/2021,"Much noise from the bars on the other side of the river and somewhat inclined. For the rest, great location and very easy access from the highway."
21654,1711609,4,tinocenteno,17/12/2021,"Very good place. Quiet overnight. Thanks to the City Council of Badajoz. The town hall of your neighbor, Cáceres, let him wake up. I spend the money in Badajoz."

It also has a great park next to it that if you bring a pet they will have a great time. When we went it was quite full, but at noon there is always somewhere free. You also have shops and supermarkets very close."
21654,1708332,4,viosites,11/12/2021,"The area is great to visit Badajoz. It is not the prettiest we have seen but it has all the loading and unloading services. It is worth going and visiting the city, enjoying its gastronomy and meeting its people."
21654,1707312,4,Jucarperez,09/12/2021,"Perfect for visiting the city, it has unevenness and you have to put chocks. Quiet at night, we slept very well. Without noises. The city is grateful for this area."
21654,1704839,5,TatiV,06/12/2021,"Great free area with all services. Very central, a few minutes walk from the city center and next to the river. A ""but"": it stays small. Thanks to the city council for this area."
21654,1704091,4,FNunes,05/12/2021,Impossible to park today it was overcrowded the city needs this park to be expanded or a new one created
21654,1703892,4,Merijn85,05/12/2021,"Great place to discover the city, ideally located for that matter. Not so attractive and quite cramped, but located on a spacious park. Free water filling and discharge."
21654,1699541,4,MarionaRuben,28/11/2021,Recommended to spend the night or spend the day to visit the city. It is 10 minutes from the center crossing a beautiful bridge. Next to the service area is a nice walk around the river. Quite inclined.

21654,1693915,2,Avilacan,20/11/2021,"Thanks to the City Council for this initiative. It is a place with a lot of noise outside the area. A nearby park. Background music and passersby coming and going. We spent only one night. Water emptied and we headed towards the Alcazaba. A good parking, without services and very quiet in November."
21654,1688575,5,perichs,14/11/2021,"Thanks to the city council of Badajoz for making us a space to sleep, and to be able to be.

21654,1657337,5,Jasper2180,22/10/2021,Although quite a small area there were many spaces when we arrived. A few attractions in the old Town but for us not a “ wow” The cafe is a stones throw away surrounded by ducks which appears to be the attraction.Very popular by the locals as its in the grounds of a very beautiful park. Very busy with joggers etc.
21654,1653964,4,vicenteacebal,20/10/2021,"Good area near the center but we have not slept because it is complete, free. We spent the night on the soccer field."

21654,1645334,5,PacoGR53,15/10/2021,"Perfect place to stay overnight, water services, emptying and filling, the proximity to the city center and the situation almost linked to a public park makes it very attractive and in great demand, the spacious squares, some on a slope, congratulations to the Badajoz city council for this initiative."

21654,1634234,4,waldo98,09/10/2021,"Thanks to the Badajoz City Council for the area. Good location, although a bit small for the great movement it has. As an improvement, the council should control that the motorhome rental company that uses it as parking for its private purposes occupying space does not do so."
21654,1629879,5,FIFI11100,06/10/2021,"Great location. Be careful not to arrive too late otherwise you can park next door, passing through the prohibited direction which by the way does not interfere with traffic!"

21654,1623260,4,Adamberry,03/10/2021,"First Thanks to the city council for everything. The area is uneven has gray and black cast and fill. It was complete, we have parked next to it. Someone said that you can hear many dogs .. They do not stop barking !! Haha they don't bother me but it's true. Somewhat noisy on the weekend but it is appreciated having this good location in a city at the entrance to the old town."
21654,1622145,5,Jasper2180,02/10/2021,A great Aire easy to locate by listening out for the ducks. Arrive before lunchtime as fills up quick. A cafe just Infront near the lake and 10 minutes walk over the bridge to the Attractions. Well worth a visit.
21654,1621905,5,cali04,02/10/2021,"Good location, good services and free on top"
21654,1621112,5,Merychus,01/10/2021,"Free, gray water, and to empty the toilet, near Del Río and its promenade. 10 minutes walk to the center. Its free nature makes the pitches fair and dogs can be heard in the distance"
21654,1619311,5,KaneloAntonio,30/09/2021,"It is an unbeatable area, all perfect, all the services of the city, a large park. Thanks to the City Council of Badajoz for such a good reception and good area"

21654,1616698,5,tereSecanella,29/09/2021,Very good area to regain strength and continue to Portugal
21654,1606833,3,raulmr51,25/09/2021,"Area with filling and emptying services, the parking lot is a little steep, fixable with chocks. Next to it there is a park on the banks of the Guadiana, very beautiful, it is worth it. There is within the park next to the area a cafeteria with toilet service. At night there have been more noises. In short, a good place to spend the night."
21654,1582046,5,Currocuesta,15/09/2021,"We spent one night here in Badajoz and super Agusto, it has a park and a beautiful walk along the riverbank, Right in front it has a restaurant and emptying and filling area. All super"

21654,1570965,3,AraDct,12/09/2021,"We arrived yesterday at 11pm and it was full, we had to leave. In any case, there is a fairly significant incline and at that time there was a lot of noise in the area. The initiative is also appreciated ..."
21654,1567697,3,Albert_Challenger,11/09/2021,"It is a parking lot and has a filling and emptying service. Very good location next to a park, the river and a moment from the center across the bridge. As a negative there are no shadows and a lot of noise until 2-3 at night. It does not have many places either. To say that it is one of the best in Spain (as it says in the description) is a bit daring ... But a very good initiative on the part of the city council."
21654,1560712,5,Rbleia,09/09/2021,"Perfect for an overnight stay. A bit dirty, garbage is next to the parking lot. There are free services, except electricity that there is not."
21654,1553156,5,sonia_08,06/09/2021,Good area next to the river. If I had to say something is that a container is missing it will be basira since people are a bit dirty and leave it on the ground
21654,1549103,5,Mcypyayc,05/09/2021,Brilliant! at the level of French pay stations. A 10 minute walk from the center with a variety of bars to have a snack or have something to eat. Also interesting are the bars on the river.
21654,1546092,3,mening,04/09/2021,An area with few services but easy to reach and good gray and black water service. The proximity to the center is something in favor. The ground needs chocks. No shadow
21654,1539151,2,LahmeEnten,02/09/2021,"In itself quite nice, but only for people who don't want to sleep before two o'clock. Before that, loud music from the residents and parties in the adjacent park. VE works."
21654,1533444,3,sacuma,31/08/2021,"Arrival a bit complicated, the GPS sends you down the second right street, after the roundabout and access is difficult by dirt road. The correct entrance is the first street on the right and you go straight. For one night and visiting Badajoz is fine, asphalt a bit inclined, there is a beach bar in a park next to the river that has a good service"
21654,1504727,4,Gely71,24/08/2021,"Great location. unbeatable scenery to have at the door. I don't give it 5 stars, because there is not a single tree. so it is something to take into account, especially in hot months."
21654,1484662,4,Edel,19/08/2021,"Area with emptying and filling of water. For me, something small. Ideal for visiting the historic center of Badajoz. The initiative is good. Hopefully more municipalities take an example."
21654,1484197,4,hanweilong,19/08/2021,We have stopped to refuel grays and eat. Very good location to visit the city and to be grateful that the City Council makes an area for AC this well. I only put 4 * and not 5 because to put water you have to be pressing the tap all the time and being slow is uncomfortable. Thanks City Hall!
21654,1472339,4,AlbertBoxed,17/08/2021,"Good place to spend the night and even days. In addition to the park, chiringuito and water services, you can call a Baker who brings you pastries and bread. A very kind man. It would be good if the City Council solved the light issue and the sunshine that hits, the rest is fine."
21654,1454151,3,anapsi77,14/08/2021,"Simple area, without shade, with some incline and well located next to a park and the river. The experience has not been positive since at 5 in the morning they threw stones at a motorhome and smashed the moon, so the police had to come."
21654,1450920,3,monica1971,13/08/2021,"I disagree on which is one of the best. It is very simple. It is a parking lot for motorhomes. with clean and gray water service. very central and next to a very nice park. Of course, in full sun. the city council is thanked for considering motorhomes."
21654,1436873,5,Mas518,10/08/2021,Very good area to spend the night and visit Badajoz with everything illuminated. A little inclined but with the chocks everything solved.

21654,1424369,4,CaptainMoppet,08/08/2021,Not very engaging at first. It's borderline zone and one wonders how it is frequented. After a night without problem we discover the surroundings. It's super nice and the previous comments are justified.
21654,1418940,5,karlinka,07/08/2021,"If you drive through Badajoz and don't stop here, you're missing something: 1) all services super simple and free of charge 2) great, green, very large meadow and great café / bistro (cheap!) Opposite 3) 2 playgrounds 4) river with geese and ducks very close 5) Ideal stop with dog! 6) Walk over the bridge: nice stroll through town! 7) The whole place is very nice and super clean!

We have beautiful views of the city of Badajoz, with its easily locatable citadel. And from the neighboring bridge we directly access the core of the city.

Close to local shops and restaurants. A short walk takes you over the bridge into a lovely city centre. Quiet at night too. Thank you Badajoz.
21654,1072946,2,weedvitty,27/09/2020,"Of the best areas? The entire sloping area is sloping. (It is not excessive but it already happens to be an area of the pile, not what the one who described it paints) It also does not have Wifi The only thing that is special is a plate attached where the water services says that it is an area of excellence of 2017 ( by the town hall of Badajoz -.-)"
21654,1067515,4,Bideanbi,24/09/2020,We spent the night. Many places were free. There is no wifi. The services are fine. It is next to a large park. It has a slope but not much. They’re in the works next door and they start with pretty early sounds ... Repetitive mode.

The area faces the bridge and it is beautiful but that is not why the caravan area is good. Better not to go in summer, we are gone, horrible!"

A lot of people walking through the car park and some locals also parked in spaces that could’ve been used by motorhomes who came late at night looking for a space. There are also small dogs in a garden nearby which bark like crazy whenever somebody walks along the pathway! Maybe this place is nice on a quiet Wednesday but I wouldn’t stay again during a weekend. Water is free and you can empty your toilet. Some spaces are level but most are uneven and slightly slanted. Just an average place overall"

21654,486374,5,JORDIEURA,17/05/2019,"Very good area, and you can confirm everything good. The tilted squares aside is the only thing that can be criticized, but at the tourist office if it is said that you travel by motorhome you are given a survey where you can comment on this aspect and value it. It is convenient to do it."

You have to get there in the middle of the morning to get a place or around 5:00 p.m. In spite of this, if the area is full next to the park there is a dirt track where you can spend the night without problems. We spent a night in the lane and then the next day we took a place in the area. Spectacular park Bus stop nearby. The truth is that it is the best. Recommendable."

Very convenient and a 5' walk from the city centre, but fills up and can get busy on weekday mornings and evenings. OK for one night. (There are two parking lots: the smaller one is quieter but on a slope; the larger one is fllatter but busier)"

From a large esplanade without limits, to 4 sites with just space and somewhat inclined. Instead of being an example to continue with other P. Nationals, I think they are on the way to eliminating the overnight stay. They say there is an area for motorhomes in Daimiel. It would be unfortunate. It is a unique place."

The silence and darkness are brutal! The places are super sloping, but allowing us to spend the night inside a national park, with a service area a few km away in the pueblo, thank you."

21690,1990500,4,bencrafter,19/06/2022,"Fantastic spot! If you have come for the mtb like me recommend getting a lift to the top, it’s roughly 5-6 km climb! E bike or not it’s a killer! Also the walks are really nice, slightly cross borders into France which is cool"
21690,1887670,4,jmreims,13/05/2022,Superb spot with a magnificent view. A bit of traffic at the end of the day but the night should be calm. Narrow road to go up but it passes comfortably and little traffic.
21690,1749522,4,yoyo170,06/02/2022,"Very nice day and night spot. no services apart from 2 small trash cans. Attention exposed to the wind, to avoid therefore by strong wind. We were there on a Saturday evening and after the hikers left, it was a few young people who came to enjoy the view until very late at night. it was cold, so we can't imagine the crowds in milder weather. We will not attempt it in the summer!"

Going up the road that goes to the ski resort, many possibilities for activities in nature at any time of the year. The road during winter and at least even in early April is closed from 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. Space for about 6/7 vehicles, depending on whether they are vans or ACs."

21690,85985,4,dontpanic,27/07/2016,"Quiet spot with a gorgeous view. The road from Guils to here is about 1.5 km, but narrow, so be careful. If you're driving an RV and your navigator tries to send you through the village of Guils, DON'T, as the streets are very narrow and you might find yourself in a tight spot. Take the turn-off to the right, right before entering Guils. The village is walking distance, a pleasant walk along a quiet road, shaded by trees, with a fountain at the bottom. Nice stone-housed village with a small & affordable family-run bat/restaurant in the town square"
21690,60522,5,emejota,29/11/2015,"We were last July one night and it was fantastic. It is a very large, quiet parking lot, only the cows and horses that passed by accompanied us. During the day there is an open shelter that sieve meals."

21693,3227901,3,Furgochurri,27/08/2023,"The parking lot is not bad if there is no wind because it is very open to the east. The beach when you see it for the first time seems to be a lost paradise, but... Be careful, there are millions of ants all over the stretch of sand that covers the beach, and they bite. A pity."
21693,3200260,5,isavanfretti,22/08/2023,"Parking next to the beach, with several salt mills next to it. beautiful views. The beach is very quiet and you have a footbath with fresh water.

Thanks to the town hall for making it possible!"

Unfortunately, as far as I know, there is no disposal option on the entire peninsula so that you have to go down completely to empty the toilet cassette."
21693,2443483,5,Tini2012,14/10/2022,"There is not much to say, except: it is definitely worth staying here!!! The place is a dream. It's difficult to swim because everything is covered in seaweed, but there are many other great beaches on this peninsula. If you walk a bit along the beach, flamingos even live there. It was really great and mostly quiet at night."

Stormy night but thoroughly enjoyed standing here. 4-5 motorhomes parked here as well.

I came here because they kicked me out of another place that I found in front of the Mar Menor where I was so richly alone and happy, but the neighbors complained. The police sent me here, where we don't seem to bother anyone."

There’s room for 20+ vehicles but people don’t have consideration, parking with large spaces between then setting out tables and chairs and solar panels. Shame. If this place is not respected then it will be taken away."

It was super quiet, pleasantly dark without lanterns and there were no problems with the police or other people. The mentioned mosquitoes were limited during my stay. There were some there, but no crowds. Since I'm passing through to Valencia, I have not been outside much."
21693,486790,3,padraigl,18/05/2019,"*WARNING: beware of the mosquitos.

A flat quiet carpark right next to the sea with a small beach on the left side and rocks on the right. The water is not clear like the south side coves. But it is best to wear beach shoes as there are rocks and stones.
The night we were there it was very windy with the motorhome swaying during the night. 

There are no services only a bin. Some cafe/bars and small supermarket are close by in the apartment complex. At this time of year there is not much to see here and it was very quite except for the other 3 motorhomes.

We went for a walk in the evening but we were eaten by a vicious swarm of mosquitos. They were on our clothes and around our heads, I've never seen so many. 
We watched our neighbours come back from their walk and it was comical for us watching them practically run from the swarms of mosquitos as they tried to swat them away without success. Of course it wasn't funny for them."

A bit of incline in the terrain and the air that was blowing did not prevent a good sleep and rest. It is recommended to visit the town first thing in the morning because then it peta and we could not see the castle due to the pandemic. The town closes at 8pm and people left the place quickly. It is a point to keep in mind if you arrive a little earlier. We will be back...

21700,2418433,5,claraleone,02/10/2022,"Good quiet spot 10 minutes walk from the city center, Zamora is a city that deserves to be visited in the evening concert nearby but nice. Waste water and garbage made available thanks to the city"

21700,2320781,4,Grialia,30/08/2022,"Well located next to the Duero and at the gates of the city. Load and unload right there. Spectacular sunsets. To put a snag, the squares are somewhat small. You can't camp, but there are picnic tables next to it with views of the river and the city. Thanks to the council for offering us this space."

21700,2113982,1,DavidGonmed,24/07/2022,"Small squares, no one to sleep, lots of cars and loud music. They should control the area a little more if it is a rest area and more when it says that it is video monitored"
21700,2100194,1,Ch31u,21/07/2022,"Very noisy, there is no stopping people screaming, with music and a lot of traffic in the area at high speed. We spent one night with several AC and other Campers. Ideal for dogs, as there are green areas where they can be walked."
21700,2084453,5,Delydet,17/07/2022,"Free area with loading and unloading of water near the Duero river and in an environment with many trees, you can reach the old town of Zamora in about 10 min. nice walk. Thank you very much Zamora"

It's right on the street. However, the noise is low at night. However, the pitch is not suitable for larger mobile homes. There are more car parking spaces and accordingly short and narrow. Ideal for visiting the city."
21700,1801349,2,pticlod,30/03/2022,"the places are made for cars not for CCs. the view is nice, but the noise from the street just behind is significant. the services are operational. We do not stay for the night and go to the other area of Zamora."

21700,1744570,1,AntoniaEstrany,30/01/2022,"Very small squares, next to the road, and the water did not work. A neighbor told us that the city council cut it when it felt like it... because at 4:00 p.m. with sun and 18 degrees, I don't think it was frozen..."

The place is good to spend the night, but the bad part is that there is a lot of noise of cars and we in particular, we coincide on a Saturday night and the walks of people at late hours ... they woke us up several times. There are few squares and it has green areas."
21700,1673953,4,BrisndsdeMendoza,01/11/2021,"Incredible views of La Bien Cercada, a quiet area and close to the center. Very accessible to visit and have pinchos dinner."
21700,1669269,3,cagoufff,30/10/2021,Great air of service. Thank you to the city! Under no circumstances parking for camper vans. Ideal for vans. Camping Car of 6 m you leave the template of places. It's still a shame that motorists park there. I leave this one to go to the other which seems bigger and more adapted to me.
21700,1667856,5,adriroci,29/10/2021,Recommended to spend the night !! Very quiet area to sleep and close to the old town.
21700,1661221,5,crigbee1,25/10/2021,Great place for a stop. A short walk across the bridge takes you into Zamora. By the road but quiet at night. Soon gets full with only eight spaces.
21700,1651305,3,fripouille0169,18/10/2021,"Thank you to the municipality of Zamora, for providing an area with all the services. Please note that the spaces are small. There is another area next to the historic center where it can hold 30 motorhomes over 8m."

21700,1603449,5,rgamezperez,24/09/2021,Perfect location next to the Douro river. Very close to the old town of Zamora. Recommended for walking or running in areas without slopes. Few parking spaces and a lot of noise from the adjoining road (it is an urban road with vehicles passing continuously and at high speed). It has many green areas and a spectacular landscape. Totally recommendable.
21700,1600351,5,AsierGarciaAlvarez,22/09/2021,"Beautiful views of the city and with several seats, although it is true that the motorhomes enter just right ... I went with my Camper and super well, hardly any cars passed and I had a very pleasant night. In addition, walking you get to the historic center in a short time."
21700,1595830,4,Paichi,20/09/2021,"It is not far to visit the old town. the width of the squares is just, that's why many park badly. In the afternoon there were cars parked, then they left. Pass the road right next to it and even though it does not have excessive traffic, it disturbs the tranquility. It is a walking area, so do not be surprised by the bustle of men and women commenting on this and that at early hours"
21700,1595647,5,Come2021,20/09/2021,"Excellent place, with which I am going to start sleeping in a place other than a campsite with my van. We have spent the night 3 Motorhomes and 4 Campers. It is a safe place, some noise because there is a road next to it, but it is bearable. Level. Recommendable."
21700,1577366,4,Tigomgom,14/09/2021,10 motorhomes that night but difficult to park. You have to stand on the cob. I confirm that the Belgian camper van was placed lengthwise which eliminated a parking space. Otherwise area well placed to visit Zamora which is magnificent.
21700,1576475,3,pacobogallo,14/09/2021,"The area is not bad but today it has been raining and the gray water sewer is blocked and cannot be emptied, also when we arrived there was an incident that placed his longitudinal motorhome in the parking lots occupying three places and took out chairs"
21700,1570249,5,ViajandoconCamper,12/09/2021,"Free area, has filling and emptying of water, level site, although it is attached to a road there is not much traffic.

21700,1441351,5,EfeJotaGe,11/08/2021,Good site with the possibility of loading clean water and leaving gray and black and Free. There is a lot of movement because when we arrived (in July) in the afternoon there was only one AC and at night it was full.

To put buts, the squares somewhat fair (if you park in battery you invade the sidewalk) and the water tap is push-button. Thank Zamora for the area."
21700,1405313,4,pioupioutruk,04/08/2021,"Clearly not suitable for a 19t of 11m such as mine, this being so I was able to park along just before the apron, it goes right on, obviously nobody disturbs.

21700,1329148,4,GreenStorm,16/07/2021,"Good place to stop and change the waters. We sleep very quietly. In summer and by the river, as is normal, many mosquitoes. The squares are painted for cars, something incomprehensible, which makes everyone park as they see fit. The filling is by button, not very comfortable. Even so, it is always appreciated that they provide us with these areas. Recommendable."

Comfortable and clean services. The only flaw is that the area is a bit small and you have to be lucky to find a place to easily park campers over 7 meters."

It doesn't have facilities, (it used to but for some reason the showers, etc. are now closed), but contrary to other commets, we took up 2 spaces and were only charged 6.55 euros. Right in town centre. Huge capacity. In the port. Added bonus, watching the ferries coming and going. Own loo? Walk into the city, sit on jetty, watch ships at night."
21726,2873730,1,antoniomontals,20/06/2023,The Port of Almería has not yet found out that for that price in almost all places they offer an area with ALL services included. Not just a noisy parking lot. This is NOT how tourism is treated!

Several other cars passing overnight. It is safe, it is close to shops and the center is super close on foot. There is some noise from the boats but it didn't bother us at all.

We did not stay overnight but upon our arrival in the morning at 8:30 there were several campers. In the morning it is slightly noisy due to the ships in the harbor but in the afternoon it was very quiet. A quarter of an hour from the beaches and the castle to which it deserves a small excursion. It is totally sunny"

On the promenade in the east you can sit in bars and restaurants with a view of the beach. Very good place for one night. It was very quiet for us.
21726,1865847,5,bralonso,02/05/2022,"We spent one night. Perfect for getting around the city center. We were about 8 Autocaravans, at the very bottom of the parking lot. The port police passed several times, without problems. We feel totally safe."

21731,2370962,5,Fredyzaragoza,14/09/2022,"There is a confusion of many users: speaking with the local police they tell us that the municipal ordinance (which they themselves say is wrong) says that services are €5 along with electricity. In other words, if we want to empty or fill the water, we have to get a ticket (which is valid for 48 hours). what I said, that is very bad. If the police pass and you are emptying, they ask you for the ticket"

It does not return change, it puts the exact amount. One con: There is a kind of circuit for motorcycles right next door, and of course, it can be very annoying, which together with the heat as there is no shade, makes you consider staying more than one night. Regardless, the site is good."

21731,1495621,5,WanderWebb,22/08/2021,"Functional not fancy is how I’d describe this aire. It does its job perfectly. Large enough to not have to worry about getting a place, parking and services at a super reasonable price, near to a few shops/bars to get the essentials, LPG and diesel available nearby and it’s on a great route through from France-Spain with lots to do as you journey through. 
There is undoubtedly still some confusion about whether you should pay or not despite clear signage stating 5€ to park AND/OR use the services. Police DO patrol and we did see some people escorted to buy a ticket. But many MANY others get away with it. Personally, 5€ for 48H with EHU and services is more than reasonable - just pay it!"

Recommended for the night, although it is neither pretty nor there is nothing to see."
21731,1473356,5,Maialen87,17/08/2021,It is a car park where there are places for motorhomes (blue zone). There are already signs where it says that you have to pay both to use the services and to park in that area (we ask the local police to avoid misunderstandings after paying a fine). The price is very good (€ 5 / 48h). They allow you to stay overnight in the area for cars but to use the services you have to pay.

From what I understand that you have to pay even if the facilities are not used. The price is great € 5 for 48 hours including services."

21731,1327187,4,micksalter,15/07/2021,"It’s a bit like camping on a parade ground, but with the Police and Guardia civil regularly patrolling, it gives peace of mind.  The only down side is that people with vehicles without toilets crap in the bushes."

21734,2880190,2,don_quijote,22/06/2023,"Actually a very nice place. Unfortunately, wild dogs came at night/evenings and made it impossible to stay outside. In the morning I found another half slaughtered animal and a fence is being erected across the square since today."
21734,2864711,5,OscarLosson,17/06/2023,"Very calm nights, hidden at the bottom between the trees. Lots of motocross in the morning. (on weekends) The nearby bird watching park is fun and free."

21734,2813215,4,klariferrari,02/06/2023,"One of the most beautiful places I've been to so far! Very quiet and very big! Stood here two nights with no problems. On both days there were still locals here in the evening, who tried out their motorbikes at the other end of the huge square. In the morning at around 11 a.m., two tractors started with the forest work and made the place nicer. I recommend standing at the very back - is the quietest!"
21734,2763951,5,guissem,19/05/2023,"Wonderful place where everyone can find their place! Unfortunately, we were woken up by the tractors that were cleaning the area, but it's a combination of circumstances that shouldn't diminish the rating of this beautiful place."
21734,2748202,1,antoine850,14/05/2023,"I agree with the previous opinion, a horrible night also we decided to leave at 3am because the sound had increased again. After research it would be a known place of rave party."

I really am pissed.. btw lots of sand so you kinda need 4x4. Greetings to all the other campers that decided to stay for the horrible night. 
I prefer city spots and no camping then..."

21734,2735017,5,RicardoFranco14,08/05/2023,"Probably one of the best spots, not only in Portugal, but in all Europe. No services, but if you can be self-sufficient, it's a paradise. 
- No restrictions or signs of prohibited to camp.
- Stay as long as you want. 
- It's so huge, that you always have your privacy. 
- Lots of shadows."
21734,2718715,5,croix.deville,03/05/2023,"Magnificent spot, lost in the middle of the pines. It is next to a road that is so wide you can easily walk away from it. There were vans during our visit but we can stay away given the extent of the spot (we easily put more than 100 vans). There was however some dirt on the ground, which I picked up for the put in the trash at the entrance of the spot (!!!!!)."
21734,2692958,5,Godpay,24/04/2023,"Wide area with shade and sun, green and calm, with flat places where you can stop. During the day you can hear motorcycles nearby. At night it can be scary being in the dark and isolated. I advise you to take a bag so as not to leave rubbish on the site. If it rains, be careful, some vehicles may have difficulty on some paths. It may take some time to find the ideal location."
21734,2690700,5,anettekrkfnfnf,23/04/2023,Spent a night here. Arrived after dark but it was easy to find a level spot for a camper van. Pretty and lots of space. Toilet paper in the bushes - please be considerate and take your rubbish with you.

21734,2154870,5,AS095,01/08/2022,"Quiet night spent. Vast forests. Up to a certain point it is passable with a camper or bus, further on loose sand and for 4x4 drive. Lots of shade and trees. During the day many people come, at night we were the only one. Top!"

21734,1917162,4,ASM,26/05/2022,"Nice spot. Also suitable for hammocks. On a country road, so that from 7 a.m. there are sometimes more and sometimes fewer cars. The route guidance via Google Maps initially led us incorrectly as soon as we started the navigation. So pay attention to whether the target coordinates are also close to a whim :)"

We arrived on Sunday evening, there where quite a lot of families all over the place, but still there is more than enough space to find a spot for yourself, later at night everyone was leaving, and it seemed like we where the only ones left.

21734,1700383,4,grosbeybs,29/11/2021,"Ok van / CC Good places to spend the night, fairly clean. (some waste near road and PQ). Getting lost in the paths makes it possible not to hear the road nor to be seen. (Campfire ok and easy) Pb: there is this strange guy in his White van who makes turns slowly. It doesn't make you want to leave the van alone to go for a walk. he didn't come near us."
21734,1695716,3,kristinraav,22/11/2021,Super nice natural atmosphere. You have to drive in a little further so that you don't hear the road. I also have to confirm that a screeching van drove around at night and came terrifyingly close to me. I left at 2 a.m. because I was scared. I was also traveling alone. Otherwise great place to switch off.

21734,883216,5,BrunoDauwe,20/07/2020,Beautiful nature. Middle of a forest. With tons of possibilities to stand flat. Be a bit careful with the sandy tracks.
21734,798267,5,Jannes_P,08/04/2020,"Quite a large plain loosely covered by trees with space for hundreds of vehicles in theory. The ground looks like it's sometimes used by motocross racers. There's enough room for tons of people not to intrude each other's private space. Being there alone, I found it lovely. — It doesn't get all dark — the light pollution from Lisboa is considerable."

21742,1490756,5,crespoman,21/08/2021,"Despite previous comments we spent 2 nights there and it is a great place, next to the river with many parking lots and shady trees in the morning. The nights were Friday and Saturday and still very quiet and without much noise. 100% recommended, it is not easy to find such a place in the center of a city."
21742,1329877,2,AraceliIglesias,16/07/2021,"The gauge is on the left side, motorhomes can park on the right. Good place to spend the day. I do not recommend sleeping, cars came and went all the time ... bad atmosphere. The same thing happens in the motorhome area. Better just spend the day"

21742,460938,3,JJunior,20/04/2019,Ground parking without services. You have to be careful on market days since the parking lot is filled considerably and with large motorhomes you will not be able to maneuver and / or exit the parking lot. Good parking to go to the center of town and visit the wall and the church.

To access the town, from the car parking there is a path that leads to the town, you do not have to go through the road. You can access the pools by bike and it is free, cars and motorcycles pay. They are 3km from the first parking lot, you can access and bathe without problems."
21745,3219230,2,cristina_831,26/08/2023,"Parking for the night is very good, beautiful views and quiet. But to go to town it is dangerous, more or less 1kg on the road without a hard shoulder, extremely dangerous. The town is very pretty, but with the few facilities that are given to those of us who go by motorhome, it does not invite us to return."

21745,2692438,3,trastorno,24/04/2023,"It is a parking without services. Good views and not far from the town, about 500 meters. When we went, it was full and not very quiet due to the barking of the dogs that were in the parking lot. To the left there is another parking lot for motorcycles and cars, much quieter and less crowded."
21745,2677782,5,AndreGriffi,17/04/2023,"The path leads to two car parks, one for caravans and the other for cars and motorcycles. Very quiet place with incredible views of the town and the mountains. Very little light pollution. That day we were alone. In the caravan area there is a sign that specifies that it is the only place where caravans with a maximum stay of 24 hours can spend the night."

21745,2644454,3,DFS,06/04/2023,"EYE!! This park is not exclusive to motorhomes. According to the sign at the entrance to the road, it is suitable for any vehicle, including cars, motorcycles and buses. Soon we will no longer have a place to park in this town. Either they don't want us, or they want to push us into the campsite."
21745,2631702,4,calepuz,31/03/2023,"Without services, (only garbage and light) but quiet to sleep. Authorized by the town hall on its website. From July 15 to September 4 there is a private transport service that leaves you at the beginning of the parrissal route."
21745,2626186,4,LaraVSantorum,27/03/2023,"That's all right. With views of the village, you can hear the bells in the distance. Plenty of vans fit, there are rubbish bins (although they were full) and street lights. The road passes below, but you don't feel it. There is a farm nearby and in the morning they could hear the dogs barking."
21745,2618745,4,XLV,21/03/2023,"Good parking for the night, you have light and rubbish, it is true that it is a bit far from the town but they have arranged a parking space about 300 m from the town right at the entrance. Due to the characteristics of the urban helmet, it is understandable that they limit access on weekends and in the summer months to vehicles of 6.5 m. Both the town and its surroundings are well worth it."
21745,2616291,4,elpeli,19/03/2023,"Good place, far from the town but to sleep well. It is a bit inclined. They have put up lampposts and a wooden fence."

21745,2544677,1,lavanyoneta620f,07/01/2023,"The place is quiet to sleep, it has no services, so it doesn't make sense to move us so far from the town, we are not welcome here, it is forbidden to move around the town except from Monday to Friday if it is not a holiday or part of a long weekend , that is to say, it is not possible to circulate, that makes the visit to parrizal unfeasible because there are 6 km one way plus 6 return plus the route, about 18 km. Village not viable for motorhomes"
21745,2533440,5,bross,30/12/2022,"area of land, about 2 km or less from the town, you spend the night very well and quiet, garbage services only, thanks for this area"

21745,2065294,4,LACHINCHILLAVIAJERA,12/07/2022,"We have slept here very peacefully. It is a parking allowed to spend the night. Near the town there are other car parks for the day We have done the route of La Pesquera with bikes and you go bathing in the pools. The Parrizal route is wonderful. The La""Assut pool, great for swimming. The PENA reservoir with shadows and swimming. We have gone to all these places with electric bikes."
21745,1975394,4,ageeme,14/06/2022,"Quiet and 750m from the entrance of Beceite. It is the only car park with an overnight stay allowed in a motorhome. No services, just garbage. About 20 minutes walk from the Font de la Rebosa and 30 minutes from the natural pool (l'Assut)."

21745,1884177,4,pilberper,11/05/2022,"Very quiet place with views. We stayed on a Monday night in May with 2 motorhomes and one more van and we had no problem. Just that you can hear a dog barking from the farm below, but nothing that a few earplugs won't fix. We would go back."
21745,1831569,5,MartayEliseo,17/04/2022,"Parking without services or lighting. There is one for AC and one for cars but there were RVs and vans in both so plenty of room.

About 15' walk from the center. In the town you can not enter with the AC unless you go to the campsite. With water and emptying/filling it would be almost perfect."
21745,1822319,4,bukowells,14/04/2022,"Good area, near the town, about ten minutes walk, if you want in the morning you can park closer to the town in another parking lot. It is a pity that it has not been emptied and filled with water, because they have records to be able to do it and from what I have been able to verify there are plenty of water. Congratulations to the City Council for the area and see if the services you requested arrive soon."

When you get out of the vehicle for the first time, a faint farmhouse smell fans your nostrils, but within minutes your sense of smell gets used to it. It is slightly inclined, but nothing too bothersome. To access, take a run in first."

21745,1447770,3,juandedios,12/08/2021,It has a slightly pronounced entrance but without poorness it climbs well since it is asphalted.

Not very accessible to go to town on foot, you have to walk on the road without a hard shoulder, not very safe with children. To access the Parking there is a very steep climb. Take into account that in the summer season they prohibit the entry of motorhomes to the town and natural areas."
21745,1276043,5,happycampers3112,25/06/2021,Quiet clean parking with rubbish bins. Easy 10 minute walk down to the village which is very quaint. Great swimming spot too.

21745,1170664,5,LauraSA,09/04/2021,"Very well. 10 minutes from the town walking along a little path. No smell of chickens (not like the winged parking lot that stunk) and for two more minutes it costs you to go it is worth it, apart from that it is much bigger. It must be said that when we went by van we went to the area on the right, which in my opinion is the good one. Very nice views of the town."
21745,1165727,4,Lunila,03/04/2021,"We slept two very quiet nights, far from the town and to access a fairly steep slope. During the day we go down to the parking lot at the entrance of the town, next to the farm. You cannot access the town or the roads that lead to the surrounding routes by car. We moved by bike, although there are quite a lot of slopes for everything."

The same vultures observatory, they told us that with AC you cannot access by the forest track, they do not want us to spend in the region a shame. ..we thought we would eat, etc"
21745,1064783,4,Zaldox,22/09/2020,Good access and suitable for an overnight stay. The views of the town in the morning are beautiful. The problem according to the wind is the smell of the farms.
21745,1045738,4,apeudeterreta,13/09/2020,Quiet area with great night views. I get 4 stars for the lack of services and because it is a bit far from the village. The road to access has enough slope but is paved.

21745,392012,1,quemajos,12/10/2018,I give it a star for giving it something but it is a wasteland with many bushes and very irregular they do not let you sleep at night maybe because there is a chicken farm next to the land and it might be that you get upset. I think we deserve something more. have tried to fix it and it seems an insult to the campers
21745,208308,4,xaviben,01/11/2017,We have slept one night there. Very quiet area and without any problem.
21760,3183188,5,LluisRobles,19/08/2023,Perfect place to leave AC for a day and visit Málaga by public transport. Small but with everything you need. Very clean and very friendly treatment. Recommended 100%.

21760,3159743,5,Aroa90,16/08/2023,Area with good services also has a small store. We have spent 3 nights and we have been very comfortable. There is a good quality price relation.
21760,3154984,5,Billison,15/08/2023,"Very quiet and a nearby place to go to the beach and transport to go to Malaga. Despite having only 1 bathroom for men and another for women, it is very clean and there are no queues because the shower is €1/5min. Croissants and freshly baked bread are available in the morning. Highly recommended reservation in time."
21760,3118971,5,vquinalhia,11/08/2023,"The owner received us very well. The site has all services included (clean water, dirty water, disposal, bathroom, crockery), except laundry and dryer (4 euros each/60m) and bath (1 euro/5m) separately.

21760,2874385,5,Lesdgimis,20/06/2023,"Nothing to add, everything has been said. Super small campsite where everything exudes well-being, small plots but for people passing through it's good. We had to stay 1 night and did 4. Parcel 32 TOP Downside: the beach at 800m, very extensive certainly not nickel, pity Croissants and bread baked every day by the owners."

21760,2821191,5,Domiant8786,05/06/2023,We spent 1 night passing through and we liked it so much that we will repeat it without lasting. Close to the beach and the promenade. Kindness and good service
21760,2808384,5,MagicMike888,01/06/2023,"Such a great pitch! We spent 4 nights in this cute place and enjoyed it very much. Quiet, very clean and well maintained. It is also only a few hundred meters to the beach. Staff and owner super friendly. Small shop has the most necessary things and cheap prices. The fresh baguette and the croissants are incredibly delicious! Only to be recommended: ) Top price-performance ratio!"

21760,2796501,5,Ems2901,28/05/2023,"Perfect place to spend the night, we arrived in the afternoon and they took great care of us, with information about the places of interest. We went for a walk and although the area is not very beautiful, we reached the beach in 10 minutes on foot. There we had some tapas in the beach bar that had opened, but in the same camper area you can also have dinner. I recommend it if you have to stop to rest."
21760,2792434,4,Charlie0604,27/05/2023,"A cute little very compact pitch furnished with attention to detail. With a nice operator. At first I thought I couldn't park in the lot because it looked so cramped, but once you're inside there's even room for a table and chairs. Sanitary facilities and supply and final supply good! Small shop on site and also baguette, croissant and pizza. Nice!"
21760,2766151,5,WoMoChriss,20/05/2023,"Mega quiet and well maintained place. Operators are always there at the times, always friendly and there are fresh baguettes and croissants in the morning. Small snack bar, large parking spaces and can also be reached with 7.5 meters using the approach via the city"
21760,2740976,5,FinnyBee,11/05/2023,Lovingly maintained parking space with approx. 30 spaces and separate plots with enough space for awnings and furniture. super clean!!! The site owner is always present in the centrally located shop and is super nice and helpful. The way to the sea is about 800 m. The beach is finally not overbuilt with glitzy hotel complexes. Really recommended!!

21760,2715690,5,indigovan,02/05/2023,"Unbeatable value for money! The place is relatively small and kept simple, but always clean and tidy. The mini market contains many useful things that are needed in case of an emergency. The only downside is the wrong information about the bus connections. Take line 163 or 263 for the return journey, not the 160. Nevertheless, 5 stars for us. #indigo_van"

21760,2681509,5,Myleif,19/04/2023,"Very nice, but small. Tricky if you're over 7,5m. Make sure that you arrive via Calle Sócrates, don't trust your gps, if you don't want your undercarriage to kiss the tarmac."
21760,2660452,5,Nasmi,11/04/2023,"It is a wonderful place. Clean, nice, quiet. The guy who runs it is super attentive. They make you bread in 15 minutes, or a pizza... Totally recommended. The access is good, we have an AC 7'5m. On the beach visit La Calma, a wonderful chilau terrace."

21760,2623107,3,JeannineC,25/03/2023,We went here as we were searching for a spot to stay to visit Malaga. No spaces available for the next weeks was the answer. We found a dirt patch to stay along the road to the campsite.
21760,2611400,5,blakeywoman,16/03/2023,"We arrived without a reservation but Cathy was brilliant and we had her last available space for 3 nights. Reception were really friendly and all spoke great English. Little shop was good value. Easy walk to the bus stop, 40 mins into Malaga.  Great recommendation for authentic Spanish food at El Pimpi in Malaga.  Nothing not to like here.  We will certainly return if in the area.  Many thanks."

21760,2570241,5,die2,06/02/2023,Small parking space that is circular. Baquettes are freshly baked so they are always available. Owner family and the blonde lady super friendly and helpful. Shower (1 € 5 minutes) and toilet always sparkling clean. Quietly located in the middle of a residential area. Gas bottle exchange (unfortunately only Cepsa) possible. We felt very comfortable and would love to come back.
21760,2548404,4,polischka,10/01/2023,"Good place, don't drive to the navigation system, but around the outside where it's wide enough. Unfortunately no services for external, space was occupied."
21760,2548151,2,FrauWomi,10/01/2023,"Small parking space almost always crowded, already approached 3x but always occupied. Inquiries are unfortunately only answered with a time delay, which is why we drove to them more in vain. Access to the parking space not correctly signposted, very tricky for motorhomes over 7.5m. Pity....."
21760,2527072,5,DorsetDrifter,23/12/2022,"Good friendly reception with helpful staff, good facilities, 500m from bus stop to Malaga and 500m from beach.

21760,2453183,4,Raffilka,20/10/2022,"A cute campsite with small pitches. Clean sanitary facilities, a shower costs €1 for 5 minutes. Beach (grey sandy beach) and bus stop are about 7 minutes walk away. In the low season most of the beach promenade was closed. You can go to Malaga for €1.70, it's really worth it! It is best to buy the way back directly, this saves you money."
21760,2452413,1,jorisdewe,19/10/2022,"The photos look attractive, but the reality is anything but. The location is not charming, in the middle of a meaningless residential area. You really have to look far, if you want to find a terrace to drink a coffee. I can last a maximum of 1 day here. Cakante feeling zero!"
21760,2435897,2,sandra_denise,10/10/2022,"Looks nice, but just wanted to take a shower. Although you have to pay for it yourself, only overnight guests are allowed. Of course I understand if you have had bad experiences, but if you ask for extra money it should be possible."
21760,2428800,5,mjtaylor66,07/10/2022,"Very small family run site with 35 or so pitches. Access is tight through a residential area but easy enough if you take care through the streets.

We went at the end of June without a reservation and they found us a place, we spent 2 nights to visit the surroundings (Cueva del Tesoro: recommended even with children and nearby beach areas). Very good deal. Pretty good facilities and services."
21760,2287120,1,AraleNoriMakina,22/08/2022,"I was there last year and I already had problems but I didn't pay any attention, this year they don't even pick up the phone, you send a wassap they read it... and they don't care, after a while you call they pick up they tell you that they're sorry that now they're calling you.... 2 hours later no call or anything, and you without being able to plan the night...never again...there are better places, at first it seems cheap...once inside you pay to breathe, very narrow squares."

Pleasant treatment, washing machine for €4 we had nowhere to keep our clothes, and they left us a clothesline to hang them. The night is €14 with electricity (wifi included) Clean toilets, the shower was clean. The truth is that it is super good for a night and a route. We spent the night quietly, without noise, we will return! Close to the beach and center"

21760,2117951,5,GooseandSwan,24/07/2022,The perfect spot to explore Malaga and the surrounding beaches. 10 min walk down to the beach and the bus stop as well. The grounds are clean and very welcoming. Katherine who owns the site is very warm and welcoming. The price was very good for its location and facilities. Some shaded spots and it is very quiet area at night. Wish we could’ve stayed longer!
21760,2092831,5,SanvandenBerg,19/07/2022,A very nice place to visit Malaga from there. The people who helped us were very helpful and spoke good English. She advised us on the best place to stand in terms of shade. Everything looks neat and works properly.

As a family, they rather see you leaving. Also there are many motorhomes standing there for months. The ambiance is therefore not very good."
21760,2037327,5,jerovega7,04/07/2022,"I agree with previous opinions, except for that of Opark4nigth, the reception could not be more friendly with customers, any problem is solved immediately and the tranquility that is breathed in the area is absolute.

Staff is very friendly and helpful, they speak good English (an exception in Spain). The only less point is that the shower costs €1.00 for 5 min, but only gets warm after 1 min. And no hot water for the dishes."
21760,2015634,4,CANB,27/06/2022,"Highly recommended area, very attentive staff. To put a but that they charge you one euro for five minutes of shower, it should come in the amount that is paid for the area and also that there is only one shower, one bathroom, which I think should be improved."

No noisy traffic outside and a quite small site so it all felt safe and secure when traveling with kids. We did not visit the beach but instead took the bus to both Rincón de la Victoria and Málaga beaches to spend our days there.

21760,1822688,5,CagouilleExpress,15/04/2022,Indeed the streets on the last meters are narrow but a great welcome. There is a bus that passes through the city to go to Málaga. It's small and quickly filled but very pleasant.
21760,1815197,5,Mistouflette194,11/04/2022,Very nice
21760,1801846,4,globulus,31/03/2022,"nice welcome. demarcated pitches. the toilets lived. but the atmosphere looks nice. the environment is not great, between residential area and wasteland. black sand beach."
21760,1791247,4,Perrot86,22/03/2022,"Nice area, clean, convenient to visit Malaga, near the beach. Super friendly staff."
21760,1773863,3,TheBananas,05/03/2022,"We got one of the last spots around midday and were received by a super nice guy. Electricity is 4€ now, he explained that they have to raise the price due to general price increases. 
We didn't feel too comfortable being stuck between other campers like sardines, you almost feel watched by the other (some probably longterm) guests. Paying 1€ for a time pressured shower isn't nice, either."
21760,1763984,3,Simido69,23/02/2022,Unfortunately it was full - access a bit complicated. Pitches look small and cramped. But then we found another nice campsite...
21760,1759298,5,Valtu.21,18/02/2022,A very good decision to visit Malaga in a quiet way. Superbly managed by Caty.
21760,1757405,4,mauromanzato,16/02/2022,"very nice rest area, well maintained with very efficient and numerous loading and unloading services, very clean showers, it is not close to Malaga but the bus is 3 minutes walk from the rest area, Alicia is very friendly, often full advice to book with the internet."
21760,1727721,3,nodoyuna,06/01/2022,"I would have liked to spend the night in this area, from the comments you have, but we arrived at 9:30 p.m. and the door was closed. We phoned the number next to the numeric keypad and they did not answer they did not return my call. In no place I saw that there is a time limit to enter, I suggest that if so, they put it clearly. A shame"
21760,1699212,5,correkaminos,28/11/2021,"Very quiet area, very friendly staff"
21760,1683023,5,Fabclo06,09/11/2021,"It's not just an area, but a big house. very user-friendly. very clean shower and toilet. calm. victim of its success also by the friendliness of the hosts. We will explain everything to you. bus ....... call before because very often full."
21760,1681414,5,denech17,07/11/2021,Sorry my previous comment does not concern this RV area.
21760,1681378,3,denech17,07/11/2021,"Very warm welcome, nice bike ride to Torre del Mar. Access not easy, and a bit expensive."
21760,1669153,5,Captnsunny,30/10/2021,We didn’t get to stay here as they were already full for a holiday weekend.  However Catherine was brilliant in helping us to find what we did need.  We will be back and definitely stay here if she has space.  Worth phoning ahead.
21760,1660910,5,chenon,24/10/2021,"Area always very clean, very warm welcome, shower € 1, pitch € 10, washing machine 8kgs € 4, very quiet and secure. Bus to Malaga 500 meters away, as is the beach. Beach restaurants 500 or 600 meters away as well. Thank you for this area that we have been visiting since 2017."
21760,1652011,5,05091959,19/10/2021,"Superb area with a very warm welcome, small well maintained plot. Spent 2 nights Recommendable. Bus M 163 to visit Malaga at 500 m, very practical."
21760,1652002,5,papou74,19/10/2021,"Very quiet and secure by code and video, given the number of barricaded windows around it is reassuring, beautiful shower, toilet, sink, bread and small grocery store"
21760,1650629,4,mamenurti,18/10/2021,"Small and a bit crowded area although with a lot of privacy in each perfectly delimited plot. Pitches of various sizes, but even the small ones offer you enough space to make your living. The worst thing is that long motorhomes sometimes invade part of the roads, making it difficult to enter and exit your plot. Very friendly staff. We will be back!"
21760,1648108,5,jean-ClaudePELLET,16/10/2021,"Superb motorhome area, well maintained, great welcome, quiet, we had not booked, the owner speaks a little French, beach nearby, bus line to visit Malaga, location at low cost, secure, attention narrow road for large vehicles, but that's okay."
21760,1643404,2,DanimitTomundKids,13/10/2021,"Nice, small pitch with good service. I always think it's a shame when you have to pay extra for showering, but it's ok. Wifi was pretty weak. The biggest problem is that we caught a rat. We also saw traps and on request I was confirmed that the exterminator comes regularly. Gone stupid. An indication of this would have been good!"
21760,1642368,5,nienkeiliaens,13/10/2021,"Very nice campsite, quiet place with very friendly owners. Close to the beach, cool restaurant (la calma) and bus to Malaga (20min drive)"
21760,1631050,5,PaulHerrmann,07/10/2021,"What a great place! Staff is very nice and the whole area is made with love. From the lighting at night to the various decorations.. The only thing negative is that the parcels are relatively small, which is only a problem when its full (weekends). Beach close by and also a bus stop taking you directly to Malaga for 1.70€. We stayed 4 days."
21760,1623381,5,belenvalentin,03/10/2021,Very quiet and cozy area and the owners are very attentive and friendly
21760,1603036,5,la_balte,23/09/2021,"Great camper park in a recent and very clean neighborhood. the place very calm and very cozy. very welcoming and caring people. various services offered, hot snacks and croissants for breakfast. excellent place to spend a few nights."
21760,1602056,5,gavenny,23/09/2021,"Love this Aire ,it's quiet good WiFi 5 minutes walk to the beach and nice bars and restaurants and bus for malaga stops opposite restaurant. pitches are good size and you can really feel at home. owners are motorhomers so really know what a good place looks like. small shop, shower, washing machine. One of our favourite stops all over Europe."
21760,1598839,5,helenejacques17,22/09/2021,"Here is an impeccable area. Very calm night. clean and tidy, practical services. The little extras .... fresh bread and croissants. Bus 163 to visit Malaga. I highly recommend !!!!"
21760,1596411,5,TobiasProebster,21/09/2021,Highly Recommended! You can't beat price for the location and what you get. Very nice owner :)
21760,1595233,2,Capitano1,20/09/2021,"Unfortunately, I cannot understand where the enthusiasm for this place comes from. The traffic goes by early in the front, it is not possible to sleep late. Since you have the supply and disposal right in front of your nose, this is particularly interesting at breakfast. Quite apart from the impossible approach, the place is too far away from everything."
21760,1593413,5,QUICKY23,20/09/2021,"Small area, but cozy. The staff of 10, good treatment and friendly from the moment you enter."
21760,1593234,5,pedesc,19/09/2021,"The high score is for something. The staff take care of making you feel at home. Small place and the facilities do not have any luxury but the entire enclosure is very cozy, bike and motorcycle rental service, small food store, they make pastries and pizzas that take you to the plot, friendly staff and the decoration is well cared for. Great place 100% recommended"
21760,1583889,4,mamita1959,16/09/2021,"Small nice area in a quiet area. 500 m from the beach. good clean sites on cement. very little shade. washing machine. small grocery shop. The gentleman speaks a little French, very friendly and very helpful. I recommend"
21760,1563114,5,AET66,09/09/2021,"Perfect!! We were there from September 7 to 8, 2021 and everything was very good, surroundings, facilities and treatment. We would repeat without hesitation."
21760,1554155,4,pache85,06/09/2021,"Perfect area to spend the night with the camper, very good terrain and good facilities I would definitely repeat"
21760,1552790,2,svietof,06/09/2021,"The plots seem small, we were refused because the vehicle was too long ... and in addition with a trailer ... good by going around ... we could have ""passed""."
21760,1551389,5,Cordobes_82,05/09/2021,"Although the GPS takes you on unpaved roads, it is well located. Their plots are not small and they are well defined. The services are very correct and the tranquility and silence prevailing in the established hours are appreciated."
21760,1547898,3,Llibert4t,04/09/2021,"Very careful, respectful environment and good services. We will repeat for sure."
21760,1542887,5,JorgeCF,03/09/2021,"We did one night because we were passing through but it made us want to stay more days, without a doubt a great place, nice, well cared for, with clean and large pitches with shade thanks to the trees, perhaps not in all but in many pitches. Quiet place and close to the beach, also the guy who attended us was very friendly and cordial. We will definitely be back."
21760,1537362,5,javiromero,01/09/2021,"Quiet place at 12, tor mundo kieto, callaito. Tourist site for what is category ... The services are good, very pleasant attention. Bread in the morning, and the best of the best, which is very cheap ... Not recommended for scandalous ... We will repeat .."
21760,1501257,5,Marisa50,23/08/2021,"Very clean, quiet, it is perfect for an overnight stay, very friendly, light plus space 13 euros. enter via socrates street"
21760,1497101,3,SonyaXP,22/08/2021,"Small area, with departure time 14h, 500m from the beach along a path that becomes past if it is very hot. They prepare bread, pastries and pizzas when you need it, this is a very positive point. To be passing through is fine. Pay showers. I do not recommend to go with children, they value silence very much."
21760,1492322,5,Daviddu85et17,21/08/2021,"I put this message 15 days after our visit Well it's our favorite of all our areas It was very friendly, with shade! Very pleasant grocery and snack service 13 euros with elec ... I recommend !!!!"
21760,1481805,4,ilundu,19/08/2021,"Perfect area, but access is a bit tricky. Very good attention from the owners, any information you need is given to you. Ideal location to visit the city of Malaga, bus a few meters away (less than € 2 each way)."
21760,1479964,5,JordiLlaveria,19/08/2021,"Highly recommended place to stop, 10 minutes from the beach and offers both electricity and water cleaning services. The treatment has been great and very attentive, they solve any type of doubt that may arise."
21760,1477030,4,AraleNoriMakina,18/08/2021,"Perfect area to spend the night, quiet and safe, the owners are very kind and friendly, but the same thing happens to the majority of the areas, the services are scarce, there is only one toilet and one shower for the whole area, clearly insufficient, especially the toilet and on top of it the typical bunkhouse that deteriorates over time, but it is definitely a recommended place to stop."
21760,1465141,4,RhoVT,16/08/2021,"We were in early summer. The owners are super friendly and attentive. Clean facilities with basic services. It is very close to the beach and well located. You can take a bus nearby. It is tiny and very pretty. The only small downside is that they ask to be in total silence at night and in good weather, you want to be quietly in the cool talking."
21760,1462872,5,claudiareyes,15/08/2021,"Very nice owners, maximum flexibility. Very clean and quiet. It is usually full, but they welcomed us at the last minute, better to call. Very close to the beach."

21760,1462742,5,franpxl,15/08/2021,"We really liked the place and the locals :). It is recommended to spend several days. Many services, although in high season sometimes you have to wait, of course. All workers and owners very attentive and helpful. If you plan to visit Malaga and its surroundings this is a good place to spend several days."
21760,1456647,5,RubenyBea,14/08/2021,"Well, I have been in this area changed gray and black water for the low price of € 3, the lady is super nice, nice and sure that if I need to sleep in the area I will fall here, since when a person is pleasant it is necessary to share it with others . Recommended 100%"
21760,1449743,4,joaopdr,13/08/2021,"We parked there for 3 nights and it’s quit during night and even during day time . If you stay there more than 5 days , I think , the price is reduced!"
21760,1447985,5,ybakx,13/08/2021,"Correctly. With a camper of more than 9 meters it was no problem. The awning could also be opened completely. Friendly staff with neat facilities. Shower costs €1 for 5 minutes. If this is too much for you, you can take a shower on the beach. Everything delivered fresh to your motorhome!"
21760,1430723,1,toni18,09/08/2021,"Great, flat plot, very clean showers and bathroom, we arrived a little late and ordered some pizzas that were brought to the van. The unbeatable treatment. Without noises"
21760,1423470,5,rockietje,08/08/2021,Very friendly welcome. The lady is fluent in English and Spanish and is extremely helpful. The pitches are not very big but certainly sufficient. All amenities are available and it is clean. There is also a small shop where you can get fresh bread (for 1€!!) among other things. Highly recommended!!

21760,1386453,5,jopi,31/07/2021,"I like!!! a service, a deal, a peace ... of 10, the city council should give them more space, they deserve it and we deserve it. The boom of motorhomes, in three years we are going to have in Spain the triple of motorhomes per square meter that Fracia and the towns and cities have to be prepared and not only put up signs of prohibited motorhomes and refer them to the camps. More areas"

21760,1372735,5,mireianavarro26,27/07/2021,"Great and quiet place. We receive very good treatment from the owners. Price € 10 per AC / night + € 3 electricity. The showers cost € 1 for 5min of operation, which I think is correct to speed up the bath. A point against would say that there is only one bathroom for boys and one for girls, so a bit fair (although there are not many in this area). I would go back without hesitation!"
21760,1350986,5,Manuelgari,22/07/2021,"The stay has been great, everything very clean, very well cared for, very good service. It has a small supermarket that has everything. You have to drink something, they even have pizzas and rice at the moment. We have been at home and we will return. One recommendation is that there could be a separate toilet in the men's one. Thank you so much for everything."

21760,1124177,5,JiriF,26/12/2020,A very nice motorhome parking lot. The electricty costs 3 euros per day however it is very strong. The camp receptionist is very friendly and speaks great English. The parcels are about 9m long each so it is big enough for a moderately large motorhome. The driveway to the parking lot is wide enough. I had no problem entering with a 8.5m motorhome. It is a calm area with little noise. I reccomend.

21760,1021739,2,pedromartinezlopez,02/09/2020,"Hidden and difficult access, for large Ac, I do not recommend it my Ac measures 8m and it was hard, when you get to the area the plots are large but you also have to do a thousand maneuvers to enter them, you suffer ... there are cables and trees that They make it difficult to deploy the satellite dish, the town itself does not have much charm and the beach is a bit polluted, I have not felt comfortable there, I treat it dry."

Rates are: 13 € per day with electricity and services, otherwise 10 € per day without electricity. If you stay 7 days or more it is 10 € per day electricity or no possibility of washing the machine 4 €, 7,5 € with drying, there is the necessary, if you miss some commodities.

The owner provides you with all the equipment for emptying as well as for filling with water, he is constantly at your disposal and bends over backwards to be of service to you. In the morning you will find fresh bread and croissants in its small shop as well as a certain number of special motorhome accessories.

21768,1441654,1,Didak1981,11/08/2021,"I don't know where the one who wrote the review got to fondle but in that parking lot it is not feasible to sleep, asphalt parking with a horrible painted building. As a recommendation, go to the caravan park, a quiet, clean place with a park next to it"
21768,1432960,5,Naguel,10/08/2021,It's very nice! You have the water jets in case you want to refresh yourself and a source of drinking water next to it. The center 5 min walk.
21768,767743,4,Leila10,12/01/2020,The town is very cool. The area very well. Perfect for overnight and change of the 3 waters. Good and quiet situation. There are picnic tables.

21770,3248547,1,KasLimon,02/09/2023,"Abandoned, neglected and very gloomy place. Lack of maintenance in the area, abandoned, looted and occupied hotel next to the parking lot. Drinking area with kids with loud speakers and shouting until 6 in the morning. There is also a bar on the other side of the parking lot with loud music until late, karaoke, etc. A disaster of a place."
21770,3211116,5,mzasf,24/08/2023,"Super nice place with all the comforts: bathrooms, water supply, free electricity and a place to empty dirty water. It is true that these services could be better located but the area is worth it for how beautiful it is and above all because it even has a beach, playground and picnic tables. Easy access."
21770,3137835,4,jruiz68,13/08/2023,"There is an Afterhours a short distance away with music at full volume until 3 AM and from there screaming drunks emerge until 7 AM, Toledo night!! Otherwise the place is fabulous. The area is for loading and unloading, maximum 2 hours, but right next to it there is a shared parking lot with cars."

21770,3090776,1,MomoMomete,06/08/2023,"As a place it is very beautiful, on the beach, with a green area and tables, although somewhat inclined on all sides. As a site for emptying and filling, nothing good, very complicated. The water intake behind a large tree, the emptying of gray and black on the ground in the same place, difficult to hit. And on top of that, the cars are parked here and the Motorhomes are not allowed to use them."
21770,3078729,1,AndreaMoncho,05/08/2023,"Irregular, uneven ground, chocks cannot be used, therefore impossible to have the vehicle straight. Free light but only for 2 hours. emptying of gray and black water in the same chest. Faucet access a bit complicated. For me it is a transit area, to spend the day, beach, beach bar, playground for children, the area is not very well cared for."
21770,3074742,3,Viana152,04/08/2023,"At the foot of the beach, we have only made a stop without spending the night, more motorhomes. The place is nice and seems calm!"

21770,3041762,1,gc72,29/07/2023,"Great, but I haven't found the services... I've only seen a (nice) parking lot with cars and 3 motorhomes. I haven't seen the services..."
21770,3006756,4,herve34,23/07/2023,"A little sloping mixed car park with a few places where motorhomes can park day and night. Area for emptying and filling clean water, with free electricity. Superb supervised sandy beach and forest environment. Very clean toilets and outdoor showers. Bars and restaurants with entertainment late at night but quiet the rest of the night."
21770,2996508,4,jorgecopa,21/07/2023,"Great views, and a very beautiful area. The gray and black water discharge area are in the same place and there is only one hatch in the ground for the entire area. The spout of the tap to fill is quite large, so we had to leave our adapter. There are plugs and you can charge. The bathroom is very good, it has paper and soap available."

Thanks Outes for making it available and not restricting access. We made a point of investing our money and having some cañas and enjoying them at the restaurant next door. 4G to work good. We will be back."

The rest of the spaces are public parking for beach and bar services. No camping, only parking.

21770,2856997,5,defabers,15/06/2023,Truly a prime location. Daytime beachgoers. Nice clean beach. Great for walking your dog. Very quiet. Bit of a clumsy way to dispose of your gray water. Friendly people . Stayed 2 nights. Very quiet at night. Recommended!
21770,2810712,4,marinec69,01/06/2023,"Slightly slanted places, but at least during the week a great place to stay. Hiking opportunities along the coast. Only tapas bar was open when we were there and not bothered at all. Customers mainly parked next to the restaurant. Service also fine. No separate tap for toilet is the only drawback. Not marked as a camper place except for the 2 places at the service."
21770,2791280,3,Where2belong,27/05/2023,"Beautiful beach, but not enough official places and these are also very narrow. On Friday evening, all official spaces were occupied and many moved to the normal car parking lot. Certainly not in the spirit of the city... Through the bars there is music until late at night. I would not recommend an overnight stay."
21770,2790992,5,LLo1978,27/05/2023,"Beautiful view, small area to spend the night, with electricity, water and drainage. Around the corner is the bar or conxuro that treats you phenomenally and you eat very well. We went asking where to buy bread and they went out of their way to bring us the bread. Without knowing each other at all. When we return we will make a visit of rigor."
21770,2783248,3,Nelma,24/05/2023,"Beautiful place to walk or go to the beach. The water intake is very wide and we could not adapt it to recharge, the drain for grays and blacks is shared and it is a cover on the ground."

21770,2698742,5,Anna4444,26/04/2023,We stood here for one night in the large parking lot. The two hour time limit only applies to the disposal station and not to the car park! It was wonderfully quiet at night. Access to the parking lot and disposal is also suitable for large mobile homes. Beach and very nice hiking trails along the coast start directly at the campsite. Everything is very clean. Thanks to the community

The available services are free but scarce: two electricity sockets, two taps and a drain for gray water, I don't know if it is also valid for black water. The toilets were closed. The beach has showers, tables to eat and there is a small playground for children."

21770,2609482,4,lavacaenruta,14/03/2023,Very quiet place with trails that start from the area. The services for emptying are quite uncomfortable as it is a chest on the ground. We spent two nights with a tremendous storm of wind and rain. Precious!

In December the car park next door is practically empty, as there were no bans we decided to stay one night, we slept divinely. The beach is very beautiful, in winter it is a place to rest easy with the camper."

The loading and unloading area, despite the fact that there is a sign that indicates it, we were not clear about the emptying area. It is a box on the ground and we empty the black ones and also the gray ones there. There is light and tap water. Green area and route to go for a walk with the dogs."

21770,2387205,4,MiriVan8,19/09/2022,"The water and power outlets are behind the public toilets. The bathrooms are closed, I don't know if they only open in summer or if they close during the week. For gray water, a sewer must be erected in the area where it is loaded. The only but is that the tap nozzle is very thick and we did not have an adapter for the hose, otherwise it is highly recommended."

It cost us to find the emptying area, it is a trapdoor in the ground that must be opened and once it is finished, cover it again, it is in front of the shed where it is connected to the water. There are some toilets right next door when we went they were clean."
21770,2280256,1,otromario,21/08/2022,"It is not an area, it is a parking lot that has emptying and filling services. They only allow you 2 hours. I have not been able to fill up because there are cars parked in the loading-unloading area. A lady has rebuked me telling me to go to a campsite . A bad future awaits us. Hopefully it's just because it's August."

21770,2116800,1,sil_van,24/07/2022,"All full of cars. We did not find the area to empty, I imagine a vehicle would be parked on top and it is not visible. It does not limit the car parking and AC. On weekends it fills up"
21770,2102717,4,enriquesendra,21/07/2022,"Next to the beach, toilets, water intake, emptying of blacks in the sewer, but it does not have to empty grays; car park where although there are 5 spaces for AC in the shade of some large pine trees, as there is no specific signage, it is occupied by cars. Walk towards Freixo and towards Noia. There are several bars, recommended (tapas) the Ancora bar. Supermarket in Freixo (3 km along the coastal path)"
21770,2084482,4,pinkp,17/07/2022,"Very good to sleep with a van, large trees, tranquility, silence. In the morning you can have breakfast in the blue house right there and take the 3/4 km walk along the estuary, wonderful."
21770,2073215,5,gaditan088,14/07/2022,"Perfect place for vans, bathrooms open during the day and a shower on the beach. It also has picnic areas. We spent one night and we loved the beach and the area"
21770,2055328,1,Fatimutxa,10/07/2022,"In summer, the beach bar opens on weekends until 2:00 in the morning with loud music. In addition, it has already become a place where the people who use AC make noise as if we were drinking. A pity, but at 1.00 we start elsewhere"
21770,1978969,5,Quicolas,15/06/2022,"Fantastic location for the whole year although in summer you have to fight with some unsupportive smartass. Green areas beach playground for children and on both sides of the beach some wonderful trails to make a route on cloudy days. The one that goes in the direction of Freixo is recommended and then when you arrive, have some seafood or fish. cool and a lot"
21770,1973804,2,Pastorcinnn,13/06/2022,"I imagine that other days it must be great, today at the motorhome site, 2 cars and a motorcycle obstructing the space, the space for motorhomes is not clear and it gets confused, the site is spectacular, on the edge of the beach, with Parkland"
21770,1950127,4,olivierwind,05/06/2022,"The place is nice to rest for a night or two. The beach is beautiful, there are not many people so it's quiet. The drain is located behind the public toilets (which were closed). The same water in the small block with white PVC doors."

21770,1800099,4,giulia96,29/03/2022,"We didn't stop to sleep, but we easily emptied the black and gray water (not grate but manhole) and loaded the water (excellent pressure). The car parks are not very flat but the landscape is very pleasant."
21770,1545488,3,Bepeya,04/09/2021,"Nice place to spend the day, with beach, promenade, picnic area and playground but NOT TO SLEEP, a lot of noise from cars and people with loud music."
21770,1526398,4,Dsp2288,29/08/2021,It is a quiet place to sleep. It is 20 meters from the beach and there are tables to eat. It has toilets and showers on the beach. Most of the squares are slightly sloping. There are bars and restaurants nearby. It also has a playground.

21770,1340129,4,Calmnf,19/07/2021,The parking is ample and they have added a motorhome point (gray water and water and electricity connection). The beach has public bathrooms and several restaurants. Very practical
21770,1249167,1,palomita,11/06/2021,It was very good until the bar next door put on a DJ and they stayed until late. the kids go out drunk and making turns with the car
21770,1148792,2,mancuerna,08/03/2021,"The squares are not very spacious, as long as they are not already occupied by the cars that come to the beach, which is not one of the best in the estuary either."
21770,1120275,4,Capitan3000,09/12/2020,"Very quiet place with privileged views, you have water at the end of the walk and a park for children. The only but is that the motorhome is a bit uneven if you do not find a place on the front line."
21770,1057938,2,Marcossamil,19/09/2020,"When we arrived it seemed an idyllic place with those views, everything started well but at 1 in the morning we had to go because of several groups of kids who got together to make a bottle and play very very loud music. We chose to go ourselves and another AC that had arrived after us."
21770,1008773,4,jordi_284,28/08/2020,"We were alone with a van. Very quiet all night. At 20:30 the parking lot is empty of cars that have gone to the beach. There are many wooden picnic tables and a nice playground. Galicians go to the beach even when it rains and it is foggy, so there are always cars during the day."

The place is safe and with several fires and ACs for the night, but until 12 there was a bar with loud music that did not let sleep. The playground and the area look neglected, and with a dirty feeling. The abandoned hostel doesn't help either. With Muros and Carnota close by, they are not worth losing a night there."
21770,899650,5,dirovaz,26/07/2020,"We spent two perfect nights, a quiet place next to the beach, with a long walk, showers and a park for the little ones. During the day the parking lot gets very full but at night there are only a few vans and some motorhomes left."
21770,850300,4,Pataka,05/07/2020,"Parking next to the beach, quite large. There are showers, wooden tables, and a great grassy area. There is also a path that runs parallel to the coast for a walk, in fact we went with a dog and found a cove to stay. There are also several bars right next door."

21770,675785,5,Shandritaa13,04/09/2019,"Parking on the beach, which is two steps away. In the afternoon it is full. When the sun goes down it empties. So it is a quiet and beautiful place to spend the night. It is mandatory to sit on the stairs of the beach at night to admire the landscape with the lights of the villages and the stars. Beautiful. Highly recommended. Showers on the beach. Otherwise no service."
21770,629690,3,Adriondaroad,15/08/2019,Pretty good in the absolute. But for us bad experience. Group of young music in background all night. We had to leave to sleep.

21786,1613189,5,javigomez,27/09/2021,A good area if you want to spend the night or visit the town. Be careful with the GPS indications that coming from the Zuloaga viewpoint takes you up a steep climb and its corresponding curves and narrow streets throughout the interior of Sepulveda. The best thing to do is go through the tunnel and take the first detour to the right that takes you into the street that gives access to the area.
21786,1607692,5,Paichi,25/09/2021,"Great parking to park and visit the town. He sleeps well even if he passes a nearby road, at night there is no influx. The squares are small for AC, so if it is very long you will have to park the other way around, like the buses or trucks that frequent the place"

I do not recommend going through the town with the AC on weekends and during business hours, it is better to use the tunnel that crosses from one side to the other."
21786,1089962,4,Antoniofj,11/10/2020,"It is a very wide and flat car park, with space for many motorhomes and a jacket, and easy to access, although it must be found and occasionally it can be difficult if the GPS route is not followed well. Coming from the East, it is before reaching Sepúlveda and is indicated as (P) Parking. Great views of the town, but without services. Quiet, bright and noiseless."

Another alternative is to cross the town through the tunnel."

Maybe in the high season there is less gap, although I doubt it because it is quite large. There is no shade, but it has beautiful views, and it is very close to the Plaza de España and the tourist office."

Beautiful village with several trails, rivers 5km circular and the long path 12 km (for this you have to ask for authorization in the house of the park where they are not very friendly and then nobody asked for it) Path along the river, nice but monotonous, you see vultures"

21809,3146759,3,Masmme,14/08/2023,"The area is quite well located in general and well leveled, but they should put up a sign to better mark the entrance. What is worse is the emptying and filling since it is at the entrance of the area and if someone wants to leave or enter, they cannot until another motorhome or Camper has emptied or filled. Otherwise a very quiet area"

21809,3121583,4,Sotastrelles,11/08/2023,"The town hall is very grateful for the location and the wonderful location right in front of the river and within the town center itself, but it is a pity the terrible conditions in which the area for emptying and filling water is found. While you are filling/emptying you cover the entrance/exit street so that no one can enter/exit. Others park cars when it is a motorhome area"

21809,2681592,5,janbojanbo,19/04/2023,Entrance to the Area De Autocaravanas is from the LU-664. Don't follow google maps navigation as we did. Some very narrow streets and river footpaths not suitable for motorhomes!! The site itself is lovely. Next to the river and very peaceful. Thank you Spain. We love you. XX
21809,2662266,4,vicenteacebal,11/04/2023,"Quiet area close to the city, perfectly meets our needs. Thanks to the town hall for facilitating the stay."
21809,2661638,4,sxjose2000,11/04/2023,"The area is very good, the emptying and loading area is very bad and right in the area of passage. At night there is no light. Tuiriz Bakery just on the other side of the river. Delicious dumplings, bread and cakes. We liked the city of Monforte de Lemos very much. There are good walks."
21809,2651852,3,park4night804,08/04/2023,"Eye EYE eye and MORE eye with gps. It puts you through a street before, which is very narrow and with no exit to the parking lot. Look at a photo that they have uploaded where the conservatory is and there it is. At the entrance is the water area and if there is someone loading or emptying, they block the way. You can't go in or out. Once inside it is spacious and next to the river, but at night there is no lighting."
21809,2643294,4,cva-iramola,06/04/2023,"Very large caravan area and well located to visit the town on foot or by bike. Level squares with gardens and picnic area. The unloading and filling services we don't use, but it doesn't look good and its location isn't the best, in the driveway. In short, recommended."
21809,2636177,3,katabatic,02/04/2023,"Don't trust the GPS instructions. Access from the side Conservatorio Musica. Suitcase for black unloading. Suxerencia: without mentioning the name :), eat at a restaurant next to the Roman bridge"
21809,2607281,4,JorgeW123,12/03/2023,"good place, near the center, the bad thing is the place to discharge the sewage."
21809,2605723,4,Sieteleguas,11/03/2023,"It is always appreciated that a City Council provides us with a place to be calm, so for that part a ten. The area is somewhat basic and somewhat neglected, plus it is poorly lit. The site, if it were more well cared for, would be perfect, next to the river and next to a very nice promenade that leads to the town. It is a pity that the environment is not a little more careful."
21809,2599011,5,LAXIENA,05/03/2023,"It is true that you have to do a little maintenance, but these Areas are greatly appreciated. We made use of the tables to eat, we walked along the river and we slept great. Thank you so much."
21809,2574383,3,Alzu,11/02/2023,"Thanks to the City Council for remembering this type of tourism. The area is very quiet, we did not use any of the services, although it is true that they are not in good condition and at night it is too dark. There is always room for improvement and I hope they take it into account, because the town is worth visiting"
21809,2533573,3,JavierSevillano,30/12/2022,"Quiet area to spend the night and visit the town, but the sewage pipe is broken and some inconsiderate person has still used it and it is all dirty..."
21809,2475273,3,ladeseada,31/10/2022,Do not follow the directions on Google Maps. The reference to enter the caravan area is the Monforte Multipurpose Building. The access is indicated and is done through the side of that building. Google Maps does not contemplate that entrance and sends you on a path next to the river.
21809,2470655,2,rponce,30/10/2022,"thanks to Monforte for this area. However, for hygiene and health reasons, it is necessary to improve and repair the emptying of gray and black water. Duct.broken and clogged.Equally a single faucet, for everything, including clean water intake is not hygienic. They could repair and put a threaded mouth on the faucet, from the fountain, which is currently muffled. Area. Quiet and close to visit the population."
21809,2458325,4,Morcin,23/10/2022,"good area with services, there are two tables next to the river with its beautiful promenade, close to the city, comfortable squares and very quiet"
21809,2364046,4,Eltorado,12/09/2022,"Quiet night. Area almost empty. Environment nice, next to the river. The emptying station laid completely stupid. Not very ""hygienic"", but it works. For one night ok"
21809,2362488,4,EcoFoco,11/09/2022,"We arrived at noon to the area, it was almost empty. We ate on the benches and tables near the river. Being at the foot of the population, we toured the city and spent the night there, accompanied by another 5-6 vehicles. Everything normal and very calm. normal services."
21809,2356987,3,claraPujol,10/09/2022,"Poorly signposted, free services quite fair. The tap to fill water is wide and if you don't have an adapter you can't fill it. Just inside the parking lot there is another fountain. At 10 minutes from the center. We have slept well, we can't hear anything but birds."
21809,2295499,2,Aml206,24/08/2022,"The black water area was disgusting, the water change area is at the same entrance and makes it difficult for other motorhomes to enter and exit. to see the town it is comfortable to park and walk."
21809,2287610,4,DragonetaBCN,23/08/2022,"In our case we also found it quite full, but with quiet neighbors, so we had a good night. It took us a while to find it, the GPS is not very precise and the entrance sign is not very clear."
21809,2286963,3,ideatika,22/08/2022,"Very well located near the town for a walk along the river and with basic services. We were unlucky enough to find it very crowded and with some noisy neighbors, although who knows, maybe you go two days later and you're alone."
21809,2286723,4,sharky33,22/08/2022,Area with all services... very quiet night! Thanks to Lerma for this space.
21809,2286012,5,kinos,22/08/2022,perfect to spend a night it has a loading and emptying service
21809,2275729,5,pepesaspa,20/08/2022,"I don't usually write comments, but today I was outraged. I read 3-star ratings for lack of maintenance or not being able to use services. Yesterday the emptying of black worked. Today it's full, I put a stick in and it came out like a kilogram of wet wipes. If we are not able to maintain an area, we do not deserve that there will be new areas. There is a lot of dirty and a lot of unconscious."
21809,2275642,4,iasu,20/08/2022,"Very well located, near the historic complex and a river club where you can enjoy swimming pools, volleyball courts, soccer...etc. Filling water with a complicated faucet and discharging gray and black too close together."
21809,2255374,4,HooLee,17/08/2022,"Level seats, quiet place, good surroundings, well connected, nice walk to the center. Bad location of the download area."
21809,2237644,1,miriqui,14/08/2022,"Shameful that there are at least 4 spaces occupied by cars with mattresses in the back, when if we park motorhomes in car parks they fine us and the cars here (micro-campers? Really?) don't say anything. It is not only in this area, for a couple of years it has happened in almost all of them. Also motorhomes occupying two seats, little empathy and civility. a pity"
21809,2237099,4,ramfarre,14/08/2022,Unbeatable space to visit the city that is 15 minutes away following a path right next to the river. The place has a lot of shade and the services are on the access slope.
21809,2215741,4,AnitaFarlaine,11/08/2022,"To visit Monforte is a great place. Well leveled, next to the river, very friendly people even being parties. We have slept on a Wednesday. The gray water is emptied on the access ramp. It is not clear where the black waters are, because if it is where the gray waters are... it is fatal."
21809,2206581,4,Pedro-L,09/08/2022,Wide and level area. Close to downtown using the river walk. To solve the water intake there is a nozzle with a wing nut that I have left in the photographs. It is true that the sewage is not completely channeled due to the breakage of an elbow. I thank the population that facilitates their visit.
21809,2205016,5,Kamubi,09/08/2022,"Very good site, near the town, with shade and very quiet. The only drawback that we have seen is that the area to empty the black water has a broken pipe and does not evacuate well. It is true about the location of the GPS. It drops you off right on the road. But hey, that's a lesser evil. highly recommended"
21809,2176714,2,LuchiLiu,05/08/2022,"The area itself isn't bad, but after 7 o'clock workers from the town hall come and yell at the car park, dragging jerrycans, yelling, making an awful noise. Horrible, noisy and very rude."
21809,2155198,4,uxue963,01/08/2022,"We have spent two nights and it is very good. The place is very quiet, and spacious for several vans/AC. As the review says, finding the place at first is not easy with the GPS, that's why you have to be attentive when you reach the street. There is a fountain with water. We do not give 5 stars because it does not have a bathroom"
21809,2100768,3,elhinchon,21/07/2022,"the area is not bad... it has to empty waters, fill also, and where to spend the night. We have spent the night with other Camper and ac without problem. The only thing to point out is that despite being an exclusive area for caravans and campers, the neighbors use it as a parking lot... at 7:30 am some workers who left their cars fell. and in the evening some young people with music who went to the river.."
21809,1983591,3,victorAst,16/06/2022,Stop to refuel with clean water. Not a trace of the people camping and the swimming pools. only one camper and two caravans
21809,1974763,1,kaos2020,13/06/2022,"After the previous comments we decided to pass by to try our luck... but no. A group of caravans with inflatable pools follow and they have become owners of the site. Instead, to eat we went to a picnic area near the river and after a while we were there the police came making the rounds, at 4:00 p.m. Since the city council puts these areas they should put a maximum of time and monitor it. If not, they don't work."
21809,1967161,3,gig34i,11/06/2022,"Impossible to park, car park used by fairground people, full."
21809,1917168,5,amoedo89,26/05/2022,"The signage of this area is very bad, you enter next to a school/pavilion. The GPS location leaves you on the main road, the parking lot is behind the building. green area with tables next to the river. there is a walk that leads to the town in about 5-10 minutes. Complicated gray filling and emptying area since it is in the passage area."
21809,1886883,3,HectorHoose,13/05/2022,"Flat parking, next to the river. 5 mins walk into old town which is quite run down. Service point is on the access road so if using nobody can enter or leave. Badly designed toilet disposal, partially blocked. Clean water tap is separate & down by parking. Very quiet overnight, slept well until council workers arrived at 07.45 as their equipment is stored there."
21809,1863887,4,villapilarin,01/05/2022,Many thanks to the people for this area. Next to the river very quiet. Recommended for overnight. We do not empty or fill but the comments about the location are right.
21809,1863151,3,baloubalou,01/05/2022,Not convenient for services but quiet location by the river
21809,1847979,4,Camperosnovatos,23/04/2022,"Area close to the center, about 10 minutes walking. It is located next to the river and next to a table area. Secure area that has capacity for about 10 motorhomes. We were very comfortable. Easy access although the filling and emptying area is on the access road to the area and two motorhomes do not pass. I recommend staying here."
21809,1840269,3,Jonander85,20/04/2022,"Very quiet area, 10 minutes walk from the center of Montforte. It has water filling and emptying, although its location is quite inconvenient, it is on a slope and blocks the entrance/exit of the area. Otherwise it's very good"
21809,1822099,4,Burgaillo,14/04/2022,"Good place to spend the night, near the center, with a nice walk next to the river, it doesn't take long to get to the center. Poor location for emptying and filling but nice to have. With tables to eat and good views of the castle."
21809,1777077,5,Caxao,08/03/2022,"Thanks to the council for reserving this site for us. It does not have plugs for electricity or a specific place to empty black, but at least we will always be very grateful for the places where they remember us to be able to park and sleep peacefully. We did not plan to stay because we were passing through and in the end we visited the town and ate in one of its restaurants."
21809,1766169,4,mateogc,26/02/2022,"Good situation, very calm and quite silent, an inconvenience that the water emptying area is in the middle of the access to the enclosure."
21809,1683460,5,Crisamcar,09/11/2021,"The area is in a magnificent location. Quiet place, next to a walk along the river (illuminated at night) that takes you to the town and very close to the castle, supermarkets, shops, cafes ... We only slept one night and everything was very quiet. As they say in some comments ... there are a couple of men who sleep under the eaves of the building that is next to the area, but they don't mess with anyone. And then there is the negative part, that the one who arranged the water loading and unloading area ... his head was relieved ... ufff. Put it in the only entrance / exit that the area has ... if someone is using it, you have to wait for it to finish to be able to pass. In short, a lesser evil for an area that we loved."
21809,1669197,4,Quicolas,30/10/2021,"The designer engineer of the unloading area does not have a motorhome. No empathy. For the rest, well located next to the river a step away from the center for a beautiful walk. Cool"
21809,1653085,4,Simatero,19/10/2021,"Very good place to spend the night, quiet. We have spent 2 nights and without problems. There is a homeless man who sleeps sheltered from the cold, on the wall of the conservatory, and made 2 Ac's not want to spend the night ... the man does not mess with anyone. Recommended ... the issue of emptying ... grays and blacks go to the same site, a shame ... and the water connection is bigger than normal. Thank you."
21809,1638977,3,marsuma7,11/10/2021,"Quiet area, without any charm, but with plenty of places and very suitable for spending the night. Service area obstructing the passage of the access road to the area; no exclusive place for the dumping of black, very poorly designed and built area. 15/20 minutes from the Parador. Thanks anyway to the municipality."
21809,1637892,5,Carrr,10/10/2021,Good ubication. Quiet place. Near the river with a nice walk.
21809,1602940,1,yoyasa,23/09/2021,"The water change thing is chaos, the tap and the gray and black water drain go to the same place, without treatment and everything comes out of the wall of the Conservatory of Music, in an alley where if no more cars pass you can do the same. changes if there are no problems, it's a shame how badly designed it is."

21809,1552998,5,Chirfris,06/09/2021,"Thanks to the City Council for providing sites like this and thus enjoying the area ....... Fairly level parking lots and a part of them with shade, very quiet area and without noise. The only downside is the black drain which is the same as the gray one."
21809,1534081,5,carlesolive,31/08/2021,"We have spent 1 night, super quiet place next to the river. We arrived and there were other ACs and campers. There are two picnic tables and we had dinner at one of them. At night the only noise was from some AC that arrived late, the rest of the night very quiet."
21809,1530082,5,laVicky,30/08/2021,Very quiet and peaceful place. An evening walk along the river is very relaxing.
21809,1523359,4,mafo111,28/08/2021,"Good area next to the river super quiet place nature at the top views of the castle just above we have it ... I do not give it 5 stars that it deserves because the emptying and filling service is super uncomfortable, but hey is what there is thanks to the council for giving us these services"
21809,1518141,3,JoaquinCeltas,27/08/2021,"Difficult to locate the entrance, especially at night, there is a tiny sign. Noises from Workers, garbage truck. Just for one night."

21809,1498013,4,tiritos,22/08/2021,Quiet place to spend the night. 100% plain. Near the town walking. Ok to sleep peacefully
21809,1487466,2,LaFeraFerotge,20/08/2021,"The place is large, but there is difficulty in accessing the emptying area and the sun is late until all over the left side of the area. We didn't stay there because of the heat, but it's close to the village. The entrance to the area is difficult to find by GPS and see."
21809,1476217,4,Abcs,18/08/2021,Very quiet place. Level. next to it a shady area with tables. Near the village. recommendable
21809,1468888,4,windalo,17/08/2021,"A good place by the river where you can walk to the center of town. Change of waters hinders the entrance, a point to improve next to the sewage that does not have a specific cover. If not, it would be 5 stars. I recommend Trespes for lunch, a 10."
21809,1446836,4,omotecoolninja,12/08/2021,"Pleasant area located on the edge of the Rio Cabe, 5 minutes by bike from the city center along the banks. Thank you to the municipality and have a good stay in Galicia for all of you."

21809,1417446,4,sonjoravant,07/08/2021,We were going with some uncertainty after the last comments but we did not have that feeling. Quiet and crowded area with more than 20 cars. 15min from the center following the course of the river.
21809,1412652,4,LaGuinda,06/08/2021,"Very good area but VERY POORLY INDICATED THE SITE TO ACCESS IT. And another thing, it has the emptying where you enter with the consequent problem if a motorhome wants to enter or leave."
21809,1412030,4,Yoko77,06/08/2021,Good situation to visit the town taking a walk along the river. We sleep soundly with at least 15 more cars and campers. A shame that they are under construction in the immediate vicinity and it is a bit noisy. It is always appreciated to have an area of this type.
21809,1391080,5,Nela1962,01/08/2021,Very well located near the center walking along the river. Bad location to empty / fill water since it is in the same entrance and is blocked.

21809,1378858,4,retanfer,29/07/2021,Parking is not bad. The worst thing is that the filling space clogs the outlet and inlet. People are disrespectful taking out tables and awnings. g Thanks to these egoists they will close all areas to us.

Quiet area with filling and emptying of waters. The only downside is that if there is someone emptying / filling water, the site cannot be accessed because it is at the entrance. Important, the tap has an inch thread!"
21809,1308263,2,Titopomi,09/07/2021,Complicated taps for filling. Rubble on one side. Movement of heavy machinery from 8 in the morning. I did not find it very pleasant
21809,1296637,4,borjasl,04/07/2021,It could be improved by putting the filling and emptying point in an area other than the access to the area.

21809,1262120,3,willvy,18/06/2021,A good place to spend the night and be able to visit the town that is less than 1 km from the place. The settlement is well leveled and we had no problem on the days we stayed. The problem comes from the gray and black water intake and drain place. It is in the only driveway. You cannot enter or exit if someone is draining.
21809,1161305,3,GHC44,30/03/2021,"Good area located very central and in a nice place. The but is to do the services is difficult because it hinders to get in and out in addition to very little hygiene. The homeless theme is not annoying, but it does not inspire confidence. We spent a night there and very quiet in addition to doing the services (uncomfortable). At dusk the homeless people knocked on our door asking for alms."

21832,1410723,1,Pryska,05/08/2021,"Well, it is a car park on the outskirts, next to the train track and the circus, if there is a circus, the drainage area must be found ... well, the three stars I do not know where they come from, it is a car park with a drain in a corner ... and a circus."
21832,1400521,4,vilanova,03/08/2021,"Very large and quiet area within the town, with free water loading and unloading service. We were only passing through one night and there is a cider house nearby. Very good experience."
21832,1399775,4,luciaherraiz,03/08/2021,We haven't slept there. The train passes by. Free service of emptying and WC and filling of water. A marvel. You can stop and see the town for a little while. There is enough space and the Parking is very well indicated.

21832,1369536,2,Kasku51,27/07/2021,"It is not a quiet place. Much noise from 6:00. It looks like a camp, because of the people who have settled there. On top of that, the bad luck that a dog from another AC barking until 00:30, luckily ours did not dare to answer him. I DO NOT recommend this place."
21832,1362905,3,Periquillo,25/07/2021,"The area was planned at € 1 but the machine was never installed to make the payment (source of the tourist office). Very quiet place, ideal for visiting Tolosa. The only but is that a family has settled there with 1 van and 1 semi-camperized truck, occupying 3 places The night we spent there they were arguing until late In the parking bags you can sleep without problems"
21832,1247196,4,Lobo.,10/06/2021,"The motorhome area is at the end of the street on the right. in the large parking lot there are many motorhomes safely parked from neighbors. I admit that the site is a bit gloomy and even a little secluded. We have spent many weekends and I have no complaints. Tolosa is a fascinating place to go potty, stroll, etc."
21832,1212512,3,Rafa58,23/05/2021,"A little neglected area and a sad place, but this is better than nothing, there is a park next to it full of AC but it looks like it belongs to residents of the town."
21832,1186116,1,BarryGrey,05/05/2021,It's full of spanish motorhomes parked there permanently. bad atmosphere.
21832,1173453,4,docmart,14/04/2021,"The parking lot itself is not particularly nice, but it is free, functional, and absolutely quiet at night. There are 5 designated parking spaces on a wall, probably with shade in summer. In the large parking lots next door, the parked mobile homes of the residents cavort - quite a lot! Sufficiently good for a city bundle and night. ¡Gracias al ayuntamiento por la cortesía!"
21832,1168990,4,gersansi,06/04/2021,"This is very good, the squares somewhat small since with a 7.41mt motorhome. the nose stands out ... Near an Eroski supermarket. The town is worth visiting."

21832,1007354,5,SunlightT-60,27/08/2020,"The area is very good, free parking and also in the shade all afternoon. PS: I find it very shameful for people who park where they don't have to park when we have a decent area. People ask a lot that municipalities make areas so that later people do these things. Regrettable."
21832,923027,3,Maor,02/08/2020,"We spent the night quiet at first it gives the feeling of insecurity because most of the motorhomes that are parked are fixed there is no one inside and the place is a bit lonely but the truth is that nothing happened, a place of passage for nothing else"
21832,852477,3,joanjo,06/07/2020,"We spent the night in the car park, where there were other motorhomes, because it gave a greater sense of security. They have not given us any problems as there are many places. The area is very quiet and close to the center. The area to change water is pretty good, you will find it in the polygon, on the left, next to the train track."

21832,724600,4,bili25,18/10/2019,"Super town very pretty and to visit absolutely. The parking is perfectly indicated you have to look at the signs. Many Cc's are parked on the car parks when there is room on the adjacent areas, which in the long run will eventually eliminate the parking spaces in the Cc. Respect the sites and leave room for the residents."
21832,703842,3,joetalain,25/09/2019,I agree there is a lack of information to know where to park.

21832,175136,4,Furgotodon,14/08/2017,The area as it has been said is not worth much although it is very much appreciated that at least the town councils think about this group. has just enough to cover the services of emptying and filling (which is not little for € 1). but we stayed in the parking lot next door since there were about 10 Ac and the empty area. to spend the day there are some GREAT municipal swimming pools
21832,172996,2,nununeta,12/08/2017,Area in industrial area and away from everything. In fact we have not stopped in the area but in a parking lot next door where there was more AC. The filling / emptying place is hidden and not well marked.

Well located for the center and for the climb to the castle (I do not recommend going up with long vehicles). A pity that a city like this has no area.

21928,397846,5,Familyvan17,23/10/2018,Very quiet parking at the foot of the castle. The second level and the lowest level are the flatter ones. The center is two steps away.
21928,393282,4,bert198,14/10/2018,"I spent the night of October 13 and I had no problem, we were a caravan and a camper in the third step of the parking lot that is flatter"
21928,300215,3,xuandelaxata,25/07/2018,"Magnificent parking just at the base of the climb to the castle, where on the other hand you can not. Although not all parking is flat, there are places that are not pending. We slept on Friday, July 20 and despite being alone there was no problem of hooliganism."
21928,255265,3,penafiel,19/05/2018,"Very good to spend the night and visit the castle except when you are woken up at 6am by a city employee who comes with a thermal blower to clean the parking lot. Other than that, the castle is worth seeing."
21928,223441,1,Bucanero,18/02/2018,"For what it's worth, I had planned to go to the Castle and Peñafiel's wineries during Holy Week, but when I saw the comments, until they had a motorhome parking, guarded and fenced, I would not go, my motorhome was worth a lot. My, and especially when I go out is to have fun and enjoy, not what I look for problems, a greeting for all but those who get into the campers"
21928,213324,1,edutoma11,02/12/2017,"Jooodeerrr !! I had thought of visiting Peñafiel, but in view of how wild and uncivilized they are, I will pass by. It's a shame, why they have spoken to me very well about their castle and the historic center, but I do not want to risk being dented or broken by a glass of the motorhome."
21928,190358,1,eeae,05/09/2017,In view of the comments. WE GO LONG.
21928,80965,1,velavela,11/07/2016,"Very good site to visit the castle, but I do not recommend it, I broke a glass of the caravan."
21928,62902,1,VicentePC,24/01/2016,Good place to park. We have had to run away because some kids between 12 and 14 years old have had to believe that their way of fun was to pummel a motorhome. Bad education for a town very focused on tourism.
21948,3269888,1,valerieval,07/09/2023,Very dirty and disgusting place smells of urine and a lot of waste…. run away
21948,3017966,3,maraguila,25/07/2023,"Stop to see the spectacular Romanesque church of the town. We have not spent the night, we have emptied and filled, everything clean and correct. Perhaps to sleep it is a place with little charm but the municipalities are very grateful to have it."
21948,2917332,5,Mvariant,03/07/2023,Part with asphalt and another with earth. pretty flat. You can discharge gray and black water but the filling tap did not work. Next to it you have the well-kept municipal swimming pool. Adults 2 euros and children (up to 16) 1 euro. Mandatory pool cap. They sell them there. It has a bar to have a drink or snack on basic and quick things.
21948,2893900,4,diera,26/06/2023,"the tap to load water does not work, behind it there is one that more or less does the fix, area with shade and air that is appreciated when it is very hot☺️"
21948,2819616,2,pif22,04/06/2023,"The locks and the city are worth seeing. To spend a night, it is better to look elsewhere ..."
21948,2685707,3,VeniVidiBibi,21/04/2023,"Grass parking and a free service point. 
on our visit, the cassette tap wasn't working , so we collected water in bottles from the fresh tap to rinse.

some bars and cafes , we only stopped as we are walking the Camino de Santiago."
21948,2670769,4,nicalonso27,14/04/2023,We've been great. No noise and next to the town. Very good to visit Fromista and the locks of the Castilla canal.
21948,2665136,4,jlacacho,12/04/2023,The area has the necessary services to visit Fromista and its surroundings. I use it to cover a part of the Castilla channel by bike. It is 10 minutes from the center and a little more to see the quadruple lock of the canal and even take the boat that runs part of it.
21948,2655500,3,Pantocrator,09/04/2023,"A little out of the way but fine, a lot of surveillance by the Civil Guard and it is not very noisy. Thanks to the people."
21948,2631046,4,dombegue,30/03/2023,"Water available, waste water drain and cassette drain. Small flat on the place, and also on the cleanliness. Thanks to the municipality for the existence of the area."
21948,2562433,5,Dani87,28/01/2023,Perfect to empty toilet for free and water tap with a thread fitting but push tap. wonderful service!
21948,2508881,3,CalViudo,29/11/2022,"Area with all services, except light, free very desolate and not pleasant. On the outskirts of town and away from shops and restaurants. The situation is a pity because the town deserves a visit. However, thanks to the city council."
21948,2473990,3,txudens,31/10/2022,"A little desolate and on the outskirts. At 10 minutes from the center. The gray cast area has a curb, although it can be surrounded. The free water service has worked well for us."
21948,2367816,1,legolicas,13/09/2022,"Very very dirty, isolated and the day I was there it looked like a dump, too bad I didn't stay"
21948,2346819,3,juanini,06/09/2022,A bit isolated area. although it is always to be thanked to the town halls that dedicate spaces for AC. Perfect black water. Gray waters as they say there is a curb but it can be accessed from the side. As of today there was no water in the tap. Trash and containers to the side. Fromista is well worth a stop and a better situated area. Thank you!!!
21948,2234749,4,nazaretss,14/08/2022,"The area is land. Next to it there is a flat paved parking perfect for spending the night, next to the pool which is great, it's €2 and you can take a shower. In the area you can load and unload but in the front there is a curb. You should not park on the side of the unloading area. You can walk to the city and you can get there quickly. Town with a lot of atmosphere to stroll in the afternoon/evening."
21948,2181070,3,MartinFidel,05/08/2022,We stop to see the church of San Martín and the Canal de Castilla.
21948,2152928,1,retuheras,31/07/2022,"Access close to the motorway, but to access the unloading area you must overcome a difference in level of more than 10 cm, with the risks that it causes to the chassis of the vehicle, not to mention the road occupied by cars on both sides of the access"
21948,2131775,1,CapitanClick,27/07/2022,"Once again, we find ourselves with the problems derived from the lack of respect on the part of the neighbors who make use of the motorhome areas for their own... enjoyment. Civilians and even official vehicles block the passage to the AC parking area unless it is by jumping the curb of the unloading platform (with the risk of breaking the AC tanks)."
21948,1878976,3,Kasku51,09/05/2022,We only stop to visit the town and do some emptying. The entrance to the drainage area must be conditioned. Now there is a step with two big potholes. Entering towards the open ground and then going backwards is the best option. It is worth a stop to see El Canal de Castilla and San Martín de Tours
21948,1858873,3,baloubalou,29/04/2022,Ok place for a night nice village and lock to visit
21948,1822774,4,juliajulita,15/04/2022,"The area is on the road, next to the municipal swimming pools, it is small but correct. In April it was the parties of the fifths and the music resounded. The town is beautiful and the Canal de Castilla surprising."
21948,1818795,4,NovemberCharlie,13/04/2022,Handy parking on the edge of pretty small town.  Good place to park while exploring.
21948,1774108,5,yoshy,05/03/2022,It's all OK. Also suitable for overnight stays.
21948,1769441,4,llanicos,28/02/2022,"quite flat quiet site, although space is limited."
21948,1736571,4,Yeskita,18/01/2022,"Very pretty town, with several churches and hermitage to see. Also at the end of the town you can visit the Canal de Castilla, beautiful and with the possibility of visiting it by boat (although in January it is stopped). The area itself does not have much, but you sleep peacefully, although you can hear the train."
21948,1706879,3,Galileo74,09/12/2021,"We arrived at night and we did not find any car, and feeling lonely, and the place quite dark, we looked for parking in the streets of the center and without problems. the truth is that we use the services and without problems. just comment that the front curb of the sill for the discharge is quite high, and the lateral access is better. otherwise a visit to the town is a must."
21948,1673180,3,BrisndsdeMendoza,01/11/2021,"Correct for a quick stop, water change and visit to Fromista everything works correctly."
21948,1658541,4,Ecorbos,23/10/2021,"The area is close by, a five minute walk and you are in the center of town. It has all the services. The stay (Oct 15) was very quiet, good restaurants and a very beautiful town."
21948,1634137,4,susins06,09/10/2021,Quiet area. The noise of the road is not heard the train has been heard but only once before falling asleep. If it is not very clean it is because people leave little pieces of paper so be aware and leave the places where you park clean.
21948,1619232,4,rulandovoy,30/09/2021,"Easy access, well equipped although a bit far from the center of town. Fromista is worth a visit, it has 3 very interesting churches as well as the Castilla Canal locks that are also worth visiting."
21948,1519105,4,mussol8,27/08/2021,"The great and new service module. Alert with access to the emptying space, make a small step. We parked in the paved area and despite being small we slept three vehicles without any problems. Easy access from the road. good cell phone coverage."
21948,1503560,4,Belen_69,23/08/2021,"Very easy access from the highway, little space to park. Municipal pool next door, very nice for only 2 euros"
21948,1494191,4,radar68,21/08/2021,"The town is well worth a visit, the filling and emptying area is perfect, the only problem is that today there were flies and mosquitoes, we have come to the Carrión de los Condes area and perfect!"
21948,1491171,3,Dape,21/08/2021,"Easy access from the highway, the dump area in good condition"
21948,1402499,3,Duque73,04/08/2021,"Very quiet place to spend the night, you can use the services and the pool showers"
21948,1343707,3,zarigueyas,20/07/2021,Small area with little shade but with emptying service and clean water intake working. Next to the municipal swimming pool. The very pretty town. Worth.
21948,1341799,2,Technopilgrim,19/07/2021,"We were there on 07/11/2021. We stayed to eat and visit the Church of San Martín. Very hot. Very little shade and it was busy. We had to go to cool off at the municipal swimming pool that is right there. It was worth it. We empty gray and fill clean. The area is not worth much but at least the services worked and were free, which represents a help that is always appreciated."
21948,1240850,1,dsainz,06/06/2021,"The water intakes do not work. Dirt and ""suspicious"" puddles around the dump area."
21948,1233589,3,Bisis29,03/06/2021,"Nice town, thanks to the city council for the area. The water intakes do not work."
21948,1231407,1,robertoro,02/06/2021,Well today the water intakes did not work
21948,1215966,3,Quicolas,24/05/2021,"Small area and a bit seedy, run down and a bit out of the way. Free services and little else. Anodyne. Fromista essential visit. Cool"
21948,1215672,3,kasta85,24/05/2021,Good place to recharge and empty water since you hardly deviate from the highway
21948,1203480,3,Ragnarelgris,17/05/2021,"We spent one night and it was very quiet, the truth is that it is a bit abandoned and poorly lit."
21948,1110528,2,Burgaillo,01/11/2020,"Bad, run down, dark and roadside, noisy"
21948,1090635,3,Clouless,12/10/2020,"Place to park, nothing special, close to fromista which is rather expensive for food and drinks"
21948,1072112,2,RamonKTF,27/09/2020,"Very abandoned and poorly maintained services. Noisy surroundings. I didn't stay for the night. Only parking for visits to Frómista. During the pool season, it will be difficult to find a parking space."
21948,1018870,3,Lorencros,01/09/2020,"Recommended for stopping, emptying, filling ect. The fountain does not have a thread and little flow but there is a chest next to the fountain if you open it there is a socket with a thread, but you do have to carry pliers or a spanner. The only bad thing that some MARRANO has emptied the sewage into that casket when there is one in yellow and it puts WC."
21948,1018324,2,cresbar,01/09/2020,"The area is actually the pool parking lot. Very dirty. Very bad and dirty services. There are two boxes, one for black and one for clean water. In the clean water one they had emptied several cassettes, and it was flooded with floating feces, without being able to use. The only option was a tap without thread or flow, which you have to press all the time so that water comes out."
21948,1015521,3,rodridomalo,30/08/2020,"Fair enough, noisy and with cars going to the pool."
21948,1012364,2,Javi_Coyanza,29/08/2020,"To change waters and emptying it is worth, otherwise very very dirty environment and left no attention. A shame with the facilities they have. Very peculiar town to walk its streets and visit churches, that yes with donation ahead."
21948,991415,5,noedia,22/08/2020,"It is a clean rest area, curious, what is expected of an area to be able to spend a couple of nights and discharge water."
21948,924687,5,ciudadanok,03/08/2020,"A pleasant flirt, with essential services for ACs and Campers. Quiet and comfortable to spend the night. A pleasant walk from the center of the pleasant town. An idea to be imitated by other municipalities that seek to attract quality and respectful tourism. Chapó."
21948,863619,3,Kuffner,12/07/2020,"Area with water and drain. ATTENTION, the water tap is a fountain type and it is difficult to refuel if you do not have the appropriate adapter. You can always fill with carafes and a funnel. Shaded areas."
21948,857111,3,Tiris,09/07/2020,"Not bad. We have eaten in the shade. The concrete sidewalk gives to put table and chairs. The font works fine. We have missed recycling bins, there was only normal garbage. The pool was open. We have not entered but people were seen leaving."
21948,845837,1,seteymar,02/07/2020,"We have come and gone. It was all full of water, full bins. A little abandoned."
21948,720230,5,Obiwan00,13/10/2019,Place with all services and to spend the night very quiet and next to another AC. The place is taken care of.
21948,713801,2,Elenaponfe,05/10/2019,"Area a short walk from the town, has all the services and is appreciated, but the parking place is neglected, we slept next to another AC and a van, because we saw that we were not alone but in the morning we went to park to another area of the town because we did not like to leave it there. In front of the Camino de Santiago, the town has very nice churches, especially a Romanesque and you can make some stretch of the Canal d Castilla (highly recommended by bicycle)"
21948,711728,2,Maark,03/10/2019,I just parked to see the town. Pretty careless.
21948,692917,3,apeos,16/09/2019,we don't sleep just park we see something left
21948,653542,3,padraigl,23/08/2019,"Planned to stop here for a couple of days but the minute I got out of the van I was bitten on the leg by a mosquitoe and that was at 3pm in 34 degrees!. I know they like me but that too quick for my liking.
Didn't want the battle later on in the evening so decided to move on."
21948,475726,4,jferfre,04/05/2019,It's really good. It has water and emptying.
21948,474786,1,agustinypili,03/05/2019,"The first week of May they are celebrating. the area to ac park cars result, a shit sticks on a stick"
21948,413475,4,markhadley,10/12/2018,Our third visit here. Convenient spot. facilities as described below. It is a short walk into the interesting village.
21948,412714,4,Jentilzubi,08/12/2018,"Small but correct motorhome area, I have not found it as dirty as they said in the rest of the comments. The only thing that had broken the handle of the water tap, but with a wrench solved, otherwise everything was fine. Ideal as a stage if you want to follow the Canal de Castilla."
21948,392915,2,jazfiend,13/10/2018,"Good to park for the visit of the village. The services exist but are a little precarious. Access to water is inconvenient (single tap, no thread to fix a fitting). But the good thing is that the area exists and it is free."
21948,278936,5,Marquesmm,02/07/2018,Great rest area and to visit the town stop pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela. Follow the instructions on the informative sign to load water in the winter months.
21948,278488,1,llabiegu,01/07/2018,Very dirty and insecure. It is at the entrance of the town. Not recommendable
21948,248447,2,pichy,08/05/2018,We did not spend the night because we found it dirty and unsafe and the services work but they are a bit precarious. Very improvable
21948,148177,4,PacoFernandez,05/07/2017,Very quiet place next to the pool and 200 meters from the town center. It is located next to the Camino de Santiago.
21948,114517,3,JohnRidd,17/11/2016,"The aire is fine and clean. The service point ok if you have a larger van then you may not like the access to the concrete plinth. All the services work well and they are free. There is also a self service weigh bridge on the other side of the road it charged us 30 cents to weight our 4500 kg Hymer, brilliant at least you know where you are. First repsol garage on the way to Leon after you leave has LPG and great services."
21948,102275,1,mariuca,02/09/2016,"Being is, but it's a shame. It is simply a small space that has been left between the last building and the highway. Very dirty It does not invite at all to stay. A shame"
21948,87046,3,momocath,30/07/2016,Great for a night with pool and always 1 and 2 euros child / adult.
21948,82152,1,jpagullo,16/07/2016,Currently the place is a little dirty and neglected.

21953,2439945,2,rafafpf,12/10/2022,"At night young people drinking until 2 and then traffic from 7. We still had no luck. The site is fine, a little sloping. The faucet doesn't work."

21953,1142948,2,stinanielsen,26/02/2021,"Ok, near the city. The water didnt work. But you can find water outside the cityhall. And in the other playgrounds. We did not spend the night."
21953,775708,1,casablanca,03/02/2020,"Beautiful place, quiet, shady, dog piles everywhere, rubbish everywhere despite the containers set up. Too bad. Taps without water. I didn't stay."
21953,746205,5,chloejones2012,23/11/2019,Lovely little place. Especially if you have kids they would love the playground. Nice and quite at night. But be warned there are lights that are bright so make sure you have to blackouts on.
21953,639195,4,Bodievonhoernschi,18/08/2019,"We arrived at night and just stayed there to sleep but it's a nice place for one night. We can recommend it. No toilets, but water to fill up your tanks."

21953,61431,2,Galle88,26/12/2015,"Nice place, we were on a Tuesday. first step the local police told us that to be more than one night you have to ask permission, but they do not put any problems. the policeman very kindly explained to me that there are sources of drinking water, wc and barbecues and of the things to visit like the swamp of tous. pity that at 00'30h two cars went up to spin and start screaming screaming"

lovely people and animals."

Washing machine usable for 6€."
21961,2368624,4,jamesiai,13/09/2022,"Second visit to this small / medium sized friendly campsite we have visited before, more like a home with alot of character.

22007,2409325,2,juliatux,28/09/2022,"It's a simple parking lot next to the river.³ We haven't spent the night, we stopped to fill the tank and the fountain doesn't work. We were only able to empty greywater."

It is better to spend the night in the other parking lot. Now, it is perfect for emptying black and gray water and refilling the water before you leave."
22007,2207024,1,extremniza,09/08/2022,"Well, my experience was very negative. We parked, changed water and visited the town. So far correct. But when we went to bed, between the river, the rubbish and the streetlights, the flies and mosquitoes ate us. We had to leave, and as the other car park was full we ended up parking and spending the night in front of the ITV."
22007,2091643,3,adepalen,18/07/2022,"Good place to spend the night because the top of the car park is grassy and fairly level. It has outlets and taps to change the water, but they are a bit old. It is 10 minutes from the center on foot. There is movement of cars from early in the morning because it is public and free parking. The river is nearby for a nice swim in the summer."

Two spaces reserved for AC that are usually empty because they are next to the garbage containers. There is an esplanade of land in the same location where there is space for about 8 motorhomes with the spaces not delimited and quite flat. Quiet and safe place.
22007,1560767,1,rufach,09/09/2021,"A place without charm. Very noisy environment, cars and motorcycles. Many dogs barking day and night, do not shut up for a moment, stressful. People with dogs who bring them here as if this were a pipican ... Hard to rest. Hard to feel peace. Hard to understand how there can be so much noise in one place. Not recommended, horrible. Respect the environment ..."
22007,1504908,5,pabibadel,24/08/2021,"Very practical area: at the foot of the town, protected from the sun by a ""concrete cliff"", with services (note: to fill the water you need a hose with a wide nozzle because no adapter is attached to the fountain tap. ), on the banks of the Narcea river. Pitches on asphalt, dirt or grass. Reassuring side because the gendarmerie (""Guardia Civil"") makes patrols even at night."
22007,1476170,3,asturmano,18/08/2021,"Functional space although without much charm, yes, it has all the services and is just what you need to spend a night. The entrance slope, although it has a slope, does not pose any problem at least for a 7 and a half meter motorhome like mine. Correct."
22007,1395277,4,BinaWa,02/08/2021,Parking space at the foot of the village with a steep and slightly uneven driveway. Parking lot is used by cars and there are hardly any RVs. But at night it is very quiet and you can buy very good food and regional products in the village. Thanks to Cangas de Narcea for the free possibility to stay overnight and to dispose of it.
22007,1385750,3,goribf6,31/07/2021,"We were there for three days. The area is basic, it is not bad to visit the area and do some semi-derista routes and by bicycle. As points against saying that it has a pronounced drop, the tap is push-button, shared for cleaning the potty and to take clean water and the Area is inclined. We sleep on the esplanade above the area that is much flatter. Anyway, we thank the people for their commitment to motorhomes, the Civil Guard often comes to watch. We ate several days at the Narcea cider house. All delicious and highly recommended. On a positive point is that it is free."

22007,851740,1,RojAleo,06/07/2020,Appalling. Despite the fact that we spent the night it is a place that we did not like at all. We only spent two vans there. The next morning we discovered that right at the entrance to the town on the right there are some parking lots next to the river where there were motorhomes. It is a pity that being so close to Muniellos they do not take more care of this area.
22007,827688,2,KUN71,18/06/2020,"Only two specific and narrow spaces for motorhomes. There are much more parking spaces and an esplanade right next to it. It is good to visit the villa, but for the night I give it a 5 out of 10."

22007,622925,4,elgeorge,12/08/2019,We love the site. Near the center and with water and emptying services. Just behind there is a field where more motorhomes enter. The site of the cars a little inclined.
22007,350427,5,jfiestasl,23/08/2018,"We were 2 nights parked on the esplanade a few meters above the squares indicated for motorhomes and perfect for visiting the town and its surroundings. When we got up after the 1st night, we saw how a willow had fallen on the seats reserved for motorhomes, thank goodness that there was no parked there that night. Perfect place to make walking routes."

22008,2823173,1,MaBeT,05/06/2023,"Very disappointed, we came on purpose. In the Acsi book, they indicate that there is a swimming pool, but not specified that the only swimming pool present in the campsite costs seven euros per day and per person, in addition to the €17 for a pitch with electricity. Moreover, there are no trees to shelter from the sun and have a bit of freshness… Too bad!"

Swimming pool good but showers often cold. Places different we like the P area. It's fine with the dog. But cycling is on roads with little traffic. Let Komet take us to really great places

In 2022, entry to the pool will no longer be included at ACSI, in addition to the €16 for the parking space, €7 per person will be added to the entry fee, i.e. €30 per day. The normal price for a pitch is €26 including entry to the baths. That's why ACSI isn't worth it, the ladies at the reception said that straight away."

22008,1983464,2,erstahl,16/06/2022,"Two stars for two positive aspects: The staff was very, very friendly. The thermal swimming pools are very beautiful and spacious. BUT: The parking spaces have the charm of a motorway service station."
22008,1869235,4,JuanPedroMunozAntolinos,04/05/2022,"Good note, we have repeated many times and it is known by us. The best area is the plots in the Barbacoas area, they are the largest. This year they have improved in many things, better emptying area, more toilets, more changing rooms, price €33 per day, motorhome and two adults with a pool for two days (incoming and outgoing) it seems economical to me because entering the pool only on those days it would cost you more"

22008,1795315,2,Wpacolo,25/03/2022,"The price of the title is wrong. The price for motorhomes, Camper etc. It is a minimum of €30 with entrance to the baths, 2 people. We think it is expensive for the services they offer. (Only the swimming pools and a mediocre bar, there is not much else to do) Cleanliness and very fair services … Beware of the “poops” of domestic animals in the plots. Cats at the bar and in the restaurant kitchen."
22008,1735870,4,Sunshine04,17/01/2022,"There are plots of different sizes. The situation of the parcels varies greatly: from very good to very bad. Before you decide on a plot, you should definitely visit it! Because of the really good swimming pool, this place is extremely popular. The mobile homes are close together. It is not a good place for people looking for tranquility. If you don't need electricity or water, you can park in the locked parking lot. We were very happy to stand there, because there is peace and there is enough space, even with a very large mobile home. The WiFi is useless! Overall, the place is very clean and well organized. The swimming pool is great! For five euros a day you can visit and leave the pool as often as you like. About 3.5 km to the town of Fortuna. There are several small supermarkets and a few restaurants. The road to get there can also be easily cycled. For dog owners and hikers: There are only two paths that are worth walking. Both are stored in the “Komoot” app. They lead to the two nearby mountains. Aside from these trails, the entire environment is dirty, unsightly, and overall not worthwhile. We can't stay here for more than five days. But just because of the swimming pool, 1-2 nights are worth it."

22023,424549,5,atos1,25/01/2019,"Nice and clean little village with large castle ruins. At the position no flat surface and only for 2 vans with very narrow passage in place.

Café was open till 22h00, people are friendly and it would be nice to take a coffee there as a kind gesture. Due to heavy rainfalls, the area was quite muddy, but without danger of flooding. Watertaps can be found in the little village. Shop only has conserved foods, no fesh vegetables. I spent 3 nights and had no problems."

22056,3241819,5,Fadila,31/08/2023,"It is true that for a city like Oviedo there are few spaces but as it is also linked to a paid parking green area, there is enough capacity for all types of vehicles and sizes, it has two emptying areas, supermarkets, neighborhood stores, parks, laundries, a pleasant walk of just over 30 minutes to the center. Near the area there is a restaurant called La Panoya. Thank you Uvieu"

The only tap - at least one more would be needed to clean the potty - in two possible emptying points, does not have a screw. However, we must thank the city council for thinking of us."
22056,2717998,3,ealonsoa75,02/05/2023,"We only stop to empty gray and black. The neighborhood in which it is located looks very good. The potty drains well but there is no specific water tap for thorough cleaning, a big drawback. Otherwise everything seems correct."

There are some great bars around the park up area. A big Thank you for the town for supplying the area. We always spend local when we stop at these free Aires.
22056,2607471,3,Waischno,12/03/2023,Safe to stand on. Quite noisy at night due to street noise. fresh water good. Gray water does not run cleanly into the gutter.
22056,2606277,4,ManuelVte.,11/03/2023,Quiet area to be within the city. Next to parking. We used the parking lot as there were three spaces left and our van is just over five meters and you are next to the motorhome area. Drains and water. Many services very close.
22056,2601476,5,Lman,07/03/2023,Free aire with services. Some noise as you would expect for a city stop. Considerable walk into centre-35/40 minutes. On the outskirts of Oviedo is Fernando Alonso museum.
22056,2594243,5,martinePB,28/02/2023,"Very practical CC area for parking your vehicle and visiting the city. An information panel indicates the buses to take to reach the city center: C2 to go, stop at Marquès Santa Cruz (near the old town) and C1 for the return (stop at Cuatros Canos to find the CC). It takes about twenty minutes by bus one way and the same for the return."
22056,2592286,5,Libancito,26/02/2023,"The only drawback is that it is far from the center. Everything else, a 10. Silent, calm, the services working perfectly. And all FREE!!! Thanks Oviedo."
22056,2591282,5,dikihotch,26/02/2023,All very well. clean quiet and close to all shops including a laundry 150 meters on the same side as the area. the town is 3 km away for the brave. thank you to the municipality and to the administrators.

lots of motorhomes and campers here."
22056,2557540,5,costalmon,22/01/2023,"Area with loading and unloading area for black and gray water. Without light. Maximum 72 hours. Quiet, without noise and that is sharing space with car parking. You can go to the center on foot although it is a bit far. Supermarket Más y Más just opposite. Close to bakery and cafe"
22056,2555346,4,javiers,19/01/2023,"The area is very well prepared and relatively quiet. However, it is very far from the center and is insufficient to satisfy the needs of the entire city. Then they put up signs prohibiting parking in other places."
22056,2544639,5,panojillo,07/01/2023,"We have spent a wonderful night, a very quiet and safe area with very spacious plots"

22056,2528266,5,MaicaGarcia,25/12/2022,It's phenomenal. Well located and with the services working phenomenally. Recommended. A bit far from center.
22056,2521365,5,funacoshi,14/12/2022,"The downside is small. We stayed several nights in the low season, and there was at least an average of 15 cars left outside because it was already full. The local police come by every morning to control the stay. If it were a little closer to the center it would be better, but there is a bakery nearby called Manin that I recommend for its bread and empanadas!!"
22056,2516151,5,Juhy,08/12/2022,Good area to visit the city. Emptying and filling perfect. Quiet night.

22056,2504004,4,emax88,23/11/2022,"Excellent park to visit Oviedo (about 30 minutes on foot or by bus), some stalls are huge, also suitable for very large vehicles or with a trailer, others more normal but still ok. A stone's throw away you can find a supermarket and launderette. It is quite quiet at night despite not being isolated. The unloading area is strange but functional, the grids are placed on the sides of the stall..."
22056,2502776,5,parkto,22/11/2022,Perfect to empty and fill as well as being able to spend the night. Quiet place with hardly any noise at night. It has a supermarket and restaurants nearby.

22056,2501983,3,Gyurci,21/11/2022,"All good, it's close to the center. If you have a dog, keep in mind that it is not a great site for them. It's around many buildings..."
22056,2498882,4,marcadiz77,18/11/2022,"We arrived and there was no room, but thanks to the kindness of another family we squeezed in a bit and we were able to stay. There are few places but it is super well located, bus nearby to go to the center and around there are bars, supermarkets and laundries... grace!"

22056,2482013,4,Sammy.jun,04/11/2022,"Free parking space in a separate area of a parking lot with everything you need or not. Supply and disposal, no electricity. For shopping, there is a supermarket nearby. To get to the center of Oviedo, take the C2 bus out / C1 back. Have change ready. €1.20 per trip. Oviedo itself is nice to look at and to linger over a glass of wine."
22056,2474132,3,toftof83,31/10/2022,"Good spot free spot with services without electricity. The problem, being in the middle of the building despite a quiet night."

I stayed 2 nights and just when I arrived it was full, I found a place on the street immediately next door and at night you can put it in. Well leveled. 2 service spaces with 2 water intakes apart from the fountain. Next door there is a supermarket, a sports center and a municipal swimming pool 6 minutes away."
22056,2445848,4,marpaufel,16/10/2022,"Good area, with two emptying and filling areas. It is a pity that the maximum time allowed is not controlled. There are neighbors who leave their van or motorhome there all week. For the rest fine. Local businesses appreciate our visit."
22056,2435599,4,thetugs,10/10/2022,"I agree with others descriptions. very clean. Sunday night was quiet until morning workers start cleaning and clearing. street lights remain on all night. I took the train into the city  - the process is okay once it is explained by helpful staff (usual: RENFE to FEVE tickets incompatible  at the moment, missing information boards at the place where they are needed)"
22056,2420458,4,LaBichaneta,03/10/2022,"Good area, with spaces for larger and smaller vehicles, relatively level and with a double pool for services. Although it is very urban, it is quiet at night. Nearby bus line that takes you to the center of the city. The only drawback, the misuse that some neighbors give it, who leave their AC parked all week in it, preventing others from using it."
22056,2381368,4,juanfrantejero,17/09/2022,"Area with all services, close to supermarkets and bus line. Take c2 to go to the center and c1 to return. Few parking spaces and those that exist are too large. recommendable"

22056,2336337,4,Eddy-on-Tour,03/09/2022,"Central, but few places, but quite spacious, there is a parking lot next to it, which is chargeable. Since all the seats were occupied, we parked our van next to the seats and paid just under 4 euros from 2 p.m. to 10 a.m. the next morning. Supply/disposal is ok! It is very adventurous to go to the old town by bike. We recommend walking or taking the bus if necessary."
22056,2328748,4,joxelrivs,01/09/2022,"Free water, gray and black services. At night quite quiet, although from time to time a car passes too quickly. There is a nearby building currently under construction."

22056,2294330,5,acampostru,24/08/2022,"Perfect area to visit Oviedo (15m strolling) has everything shops, restaurants, green areas, has two places for filling and emptying, although it has enough places it falls short for all of us who want to visit the city, the good thing that the area is around green parking lot so you can stand waiting for a spot, thanks."
22056,2289406,4,Alvor,23/08/2022,"Park with good conditions, 2 places to carry out the services, but always full in the places reserved for motorhomes, I had to park in the green area that was not paid on Sundays, the amount to pay during the week is also not expensive. To visit there are parks closer to the center such as the Carrefour shopping center."

You can park all around...but it's paying. city center 20 minutes by bus C2. C1 to return. 1€20 one way. Trade nearby. 2 emptying areas. On the other hand, we didn't really like the city. everyone to see"
22056,2249823,4,Eu04,16/08/2022,"There are few free spaces for AC and camper, although there are paid spaces in the green zone and it is not very expensive: beware! Throw the money Just because the parking meter does not return money! It has all the services: black, gray and refilled water. It is not exactly where the address indicates but if you look on Google Maps you see it Right next to it as a caravan parking area. Thank you Oviedo!"
22056,2235679,5,AnnaBala,14/08/2022,"Few places for AC, but the parking lot in the green area had many ACs. The ticket is cheap. We spent two very quiet nights. The services very well."

Supermarket next door. The only drawback is the distance from the center but it is well resolved with Bus B2 to go, and to return the B1 getting off at Cuatro Caños. Oviedo is well worth a visit, almost all the museums are free."
