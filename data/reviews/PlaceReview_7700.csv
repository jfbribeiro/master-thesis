104045,2531498,1,afineta,28/12/2022,"After spending 20 minutes to be attended to, they tell us that they no longer allow it, the boss does not allow gray or black water to be emptied, there is laundry and LPG…. But the truth is that it is a chore because in the town the area is also locked…."
104045,2519718,5,Maggiethegreenvan,11/12/2022,"Excellent service and a beautiful view from here. Laundry is quick and cheap. 14kg wash and dry was €11. 

Also there is LPG, vacuum and washing area for big vehicles, air/water etc Very friendly staff and it's handy to pay with card for the tokens needed. Thank you"
104045,2454786,5,Aico,21/10/2022,I was here to do the laundry. You have to go to the gas station to get tokens. All staff very friendly and helpful.

104045,1385628,5,phomega,31/07/2021,Add that from today they have self-service laundry with washers and dryers! I was looking for a laundromat since there isn't any in Cazorla and I found it by chance on the way to Quesada. 4 euros washing machine and 3 euros dryer.
104045,973840,5,ferisa,17/08/2020,They also have Autogas to fill. It is advisable to speak with them before changing waters to receive instructions.

104046,2141108,3,kilocamp,29/07/2022,Nice place to stay for a break. The trees of the little chapel give some nice shadow. Potentially enough space for a few vans and maybe even stay for a night. Not sure how many cars are on the close by street though.
104046,926099,3,Heyo,03/08/2020,Beautiful place that I recommend. But inaccessible by motorhome ...
104047,3150079,3,LaValentina,15/08/2023,"A quiet parking lot next to the cemetery. We arrived at the town and saw that it happened to be the holidays. When we returned to the van at 1am, there were some kids in another car with the music on full blast. We decided to go back to the party and when we returned at 2am they were gone. At around 7 they came again with the intention of waking us up. Since we ignored them, they left."
104047,2554408,4,toniromandelafuente,17/01/2023,the site is in front of the cemetery and the truth is that it is not bad at all to put a foul on it and it is not the site I would put that all the dogs are loose otherwise it is right next to a path where you get to a pool
104047,2548276,5,davidsabadell,10/01/2023,We have slept here several times and it is wonderful. Very quiet and several excursions also leave from here. Highly recommended

104047,1757007,4,Mitfire,15/02/2022,"Good spot that helps out. Very quiet, away from the ""city center"", in a suburban area. Accessible for a CC of 8m (the more the half-turn is likely to be complicated). Small: near path for dog walks. Place frequented by locals for the same reason."

104078,3107340,5,barendanne,09/08/2023,"Wonderfully quiet at night, quite busy during the day! Kiting was great, a bit gusty. wing foiling difficult due to shallow and seaweed. Wonderful 2 nights, you can also walk / cycle from here to the lake and to the town. There was some waste and toilet paper in the bushes. And watch out for the water, which comes a little further at high tide than you would think. No amenities."
104078,2738751,4,Wisse,10/05/2023,"Wind force 6 with gusts of 8, North North-West wind, yet we were almost out of the wind. Largely shallow water, great kite spot. Quiet, in the evening some joggers and a fisherman."
104078,2101983,3,Minsche,21/07/2022,"You are no longer allowed to stand directly on the beach. We then placed ourselves next to a bush from the driveway. Still right on the street. Pretty busy. Fishermen from 6 a.m. Kiters, beachgoers. There is a rubbish bin right on the beach and further back towards the kite school. Please use them too!"

104078,1698135,4,BGdu86,26/11/2021,"Very beautiful spot and very quiet, no passage before the morning with a few fishermen. We hear for a good part of the evening a kind of factory on the other side of the lagoon, a little annoying"
104078,1695120,4,Charliekiteboy,21/11/2021,Nice spot very close to the lagoon! Very accessible path for any type of vehicle. Some places a little sandy but very good! Max 4/5 cc
104078,638362,4,Jeremy2303,17/08/2019,Superb peaceful and quiet place ... in the evening there are fishermen ... it's very nice ... and directly on a kite surf spot for the next day

104078,491740,5,gil84,24/05/2019,"Very quiet place with some fishermen's huts, the lagoon next to perfect for kite"
104087,3211069,3,xexu,24/08/2023,"Good place to rest on the way. Two tables with little shade, barbecue area, container, children's playground quite deteriorated and four parking spaces ideal for Campers but somewhat narrow for Ac. Each car park has a water connection but they are out of service. It is located next to a road, it could be a lot of noise to spend the night."
104087,2635138,3,freidankvan,02/04/2023,"The basic idea is good, but the bays are relatively short and the road quite narrow, so that you can hardly get into the bay. No water comes out of the tap. But it's enough for a lunch break!"
104096,2994723,1,lidi_ss,20/07/2023,"You can not enter, there are pivots."
104096,2973924,3,Bengelina2019,16/07/2023,"it used to be a very nice place with a very nice view, unfortunately they have now set up a ban on night hoses from 10 p.m. to 10 a.m. point, there are also bollards there so that larger cars can no longer get in"
104096,2530024,4,kickerstar,27/12/2022,It goes by van (large California) the view is magnificent. There is passage to admire the sunset.
104096,2500151,5,Alozanom,19/11/2022,"Great to be able to spend a few hours, with spectacular views. There are two poles at the entrance that limit the width, but we have entered with an AC Challenger, without problems! 100% recommended"
104096,2297221,5,Walloch,24/08/2022,"Small car park with a magnificent view. We did not dare to spend the night there following the prohibition sign since we are in August, but to rest there it is perfect."
104096,1954129,1,nicolasvann33,06/06/2022,Very nice view but very complicated D access we did not dare to venture there in addition prohibited sign from 22 ha 10 h
104096,1860987,3,fanfan34,30/04/2022,it's good for vans but not motorhomes very steep slope prohibited from 10 p.m. to 10 a.m.
104096,1720787,3,vdanube,31/12/2021,Great view but limited access (therefore 3 stars) by posts of width (approx 2m) and very sharp speed bumps. vehicle with wheelbase or long overhang impossible. I did not tempt the devil with a 6m van. to do with minivan.
104096,1673904,4,benedicte,01/11/2021,"Great place facing the sea. We just spent a night there with a beautiful view. The only problem is the parking lot closes with plots from 10 p.m. to 10 a.m., so it is impossible to get out during this time. place only accessible to vans."
104096,1660548,3,Marcopola,24/10/2021,Very nice place but not available at night
104096,1642143,5,Ononis,13/10/2021,"Super spot, incredible view, sunset to die for. When I came there (mid October) the police did not come to close the parking lot. The small beach five minutes on the right when you face the sea is adorable, some fish to see while snorkeling. Convenient: showers on the beach. A little windy, but more protected than the large castle parking lot across the road."
104096,1630072,4,pjota,06/10/2021,"Spent 2 quiet and uneventful nights. Narrow and steep access make it suitable only for vans. There’s a sign prohibiting parking from 22:00 till 10:00, and police closes access between those times, but one of the guys closing the access told me that if I was fine not moving outside until 10am, I could stay overnight and that they don’t fine people (so far)."
104096,1616052,5,eric3,29/09/2021,"Very quiet night, nice views"
104096,1581871,5,wondina,15/09/2021,Perfect place to sleep. Beautiful views. We arrived on a Wednesday and there were us and another van. Difficult access for AC. Very steep slope. 100% rexomendsble
104096,1576172,5,park4night49264,13/09/2021,"Wonderful parking lot right by the sea. Very quiet area. The parking lot will be closed at 10 p.m. and you can still stay where you are. Spent a quiet night here with another camper. Beach showers can be reached in 5 minutes on foot at the nearby beach, as well as a drinking water point."
104096,1566469,4,DSaraD,10/09/2021,We went at night and passed the entrance. You have to be attentive. There are some pivots with which you have to be careful and the slope to get out is steep. Not being able to enter at night we parked on the street at the end of the port and quite well. There is a lot of space and shade.
104096,1552502,5,martirucky,06/09/2021,"A place with incredible views, the best place to sleep with a van, we slept with another and two motorhomes, they close from 21 to 10, little traffic is heard, we will repeat"
104096,1499204,5,3decamper,22/08/2021,"We have had a great night and day. Great views, with room for about 8 campers or small AC. It closes from 10:00 p.m. to 10:00 a.m., next to Camí de Ronda and Far de Roses, so people pass by all day, but at night it is very quiet. No services"

104096,1472399,5,Eztakatizenik,17/08/2021,Very good site. We slept next to 4 other vans
104096,1404643,5,nauzazu,04/08/2021,"A good place to sleep. During the day a lot of people pass by since there is a path to walk around the entire beach but at night it is quite good. From 9pm you cannot enter, but if you are inside you can spend the night without problem. The entrance is quite steep, perhaps xra some AC it is difficult to enter xro the vans, without problem. Without a doubt, we will surely return if it comes to us."

104096,1320818,1,usoba,13/07/2021,They have put up some signs on some billboards (which I imagine they will move at night) where they say that after 9:00 p.m. you cannot park.
104096,1289871,4,Fritzi.E,01/07/2021,This was a nice place. It's 20 min from the beach but up on a cliff so the view was more than stunning. People passing by but a calm and quiet night. A few spots underneath trees with good shade.
104096,1277812,5,GerardBajona,26/06/2021,"Very quiet night in a charming place, next to the lighthouse and overlooking the sea. The coastal paths pass underneath."

104096,1254135,4,sylvainTeissier,14/06/2021,"Superb spot, I spent 3 nights there at the beginning of June, the view is splendid to observe the sunset, the first coves are 100m away and the canyelles beach is a 20min walk along the coastal path. Bcp of passage during the day, quite calm at night, they put up barriers at night But do not disturb us, any height but watch out for long vehicles and sills."

104096,1225622,4,leonhardseifert,30/05/2021,"Basically great place very close to the city and relatively quiet. However, in the evening many young people meet in the parking lot directly opposite on the hill what loud music and the howling of the engine have no sanitary facilities but a garbage can but otherwise very nice with a view of the sea"
104096,1191506,5,siwopics,10/05/2021,A very nice place to stay with a beautiful view. The entrance is about 15 steep concrete meters. We stood with another mobile home for one night and felt safe.

104096,1008147,5,AriadnaArenyes,27/08/2020,"Very nice and quiet place, maybe in the busiest summer and with more people during the morning. Apart from vans, there were only fishermen. Nice atmosphere and unbeatable views"
104096,867083,4,laprimavan,13/07/2020,"I have been last weekend, it is difficult to find a place but we were lucky during the day, at night I did not stay. It is a little dirty but the views are worth it."

104096,834492,2,surferaa,24/06/2020,"Nice views but a lot of movement of people, both cars and walking. Just ahead is the path that runs along the sea, access to the beach and the fishing area."
104096,786077,4,Vanvan33127,24/02/2020,"Little space, in winter the car park of the castle has no barrier and it is good."
104096,745233,4,stevewoods,20/11/2019,Lovely views stayed 3 nights. some youths came a few times through each night to smoke their pot and play music lol.  but did not disturb us too much so we stayed.  be careful if you have a long car. we have a low bike rack which we had to remove to get out the parking area as it's Very steep.  no regrets the view is stunning.

104096,667357,4,bibiche72,29/08/2019,"Beautiful location. The view is beautiful along the promenade generating a little noise in the evening and in the morning. The light of the lighthouse is not a problem. The road passes above, the passage remaining little disturbing. Have the eye to find it in the climb on the right, the way down you do not necessarily see Impossible camping. 8 places"
104096,663436,5,JamesiCook,27/08/2019,Really wonderful spot with a view directly to the ocean and nice sunsets. Quite and save. Couldn't be better.

104096,518471,5,HerrCalli,17/06/2019,Very nice place in the preseason. No wind at all! At the weekend many walkers are on the way. Teenagers use the place every now and then at night for a break from partying. But everything is absolutely compatible.
104096,484021,5,missalhera,14/05/2019,"Very nice point of view. I loved watching the sunset and getting up to the sea, I recommend it 100%"
104096,480318,3,aude.p,10/05/2019,Small flat land with a beautiful sea view. Maximum 4 vans. Clean. We had a noisy night because people came to talk on the parking lot until 2am.

104096,462406,4,algar20,21/04/2019,"Very quiet, with no suroll throughout the night. You are touching the rocks and a path that goes out along the coast. There is no type of service. The only drawback is that it is full of dogfight ... For the rest very well."

104096,403163,1,Myxte,02/11/2018,Too small for a camper.
104096,393023,5,Didiruca06,14/10/2018,"Incredibly charming .... Small parking lot touching the lighthouse, beautiful views of the sea, night trankila, The only downside is the access ramp, AC with much rear overhang as ours is complicated access and exit. I see that it will be a very requested parking."
104110,2760561,5,MaretJ,18/05/2023,"Very quiet and nice square, picnic tables, very clean toilet, with paper. The big road is up on the slope, but the trees muffle a lot of noise. It is possible to park along the long access road. More or less flat. It is possible to stay overnight."
104110,949806,5,numyss,11/08/2020,"Very good area to spend one or two nights. With tables, for barbecues and source of drinking water. You can do a couple of beautiful routes around the area."
104138,727997,1,lostwithamnesia,23/10/2019,That has changed a lot. Now there is only a road where people seem to dump old bushes etc. Better to stand on the street.
104139,3288745,4,maiterp,12/09/2023,"Good parking, lots of space and quiet. The area is very nice with a park, in fact it is one of the Expo areas. recommendable"
104139,3242305,4,aleja93,31/08/2023,"ample parking. quiet at night. water and tables across the road. Be careful if it is windy because being made of stones you end up full of sand. next to some pools with sand that, although they are not the best and are small, are good to spend the day"

Probably also used for a gathering of local grandmothers to talk to ... There is a scarf around the benches and because we wanted to camp, we had to go elsewhere. It would be better in a motorhome."

Excessively windy, you even wonder if you're not in a boat, it's pitching so much! Very quiet and uncrowded, beautiful hikes on the ridges. The derelict radio relay is a bit creepy but there are no ghosts!"

Right next to the Charco Las Canales, an ideal place in the center of town, one pass and from there the trail starts towards the Charco Pataco, an area of pools and nature. Letur has a lot of charm, water is the protagonist at every step you take. We also recommend eating at La Garduña, a place for tapas and good music."
104246,1157447,3,Consolos,25/03/2021,"Wide street with the possibility of parking next to the river (noisy because there was a small waterfall right next to it). There is unevenness, although in a couple of specific points it can be more or less balanced. If there is no other remedy, like us, who catch us already too tired and at night, it is not a bad place. In the same street there is a Super, and a couple of bars. The town is very beautiful and worth seeing."
104255,3132279,4,maliciatravel,12/08/2023,We spent a quiet night sheltered from the wind and a little in the shade thanks to the sufficiently high walls.

for us a great stop over."
104255,2534299,4,Annemieke-Nederland.,30/12/2022,Great place but still regret that we spent the night here. The road was too noisy for us. We sleep under the lifting roof. There are toilets at the cemetery and you can also fill water. Everything neatly cared for but too clean for us.

104584,394232,1,mich2211,16/10/2018,Parked here for one night. Area seemed a little edgy. During night two males attempted to breakin through front door. They ran off when they saw we were awake. Would not recommend parking here

104614,2196859,4,iviejo,08/08/2022,The site seems to be fine but we did not dare to enter because there is still a step between the asphalt and the dirt part (large camper)
104614,2089651,5,ElenaAlmaraz,18/07/2022,"next to the Ebro, very quiet and cool. We stayed 1 night alone in a large Camper. there is room for 2"
104614,1971749,4,martinww,12/06/2022,"Lovely place off the road. Partly hidden, quiet except for the sound of the river and the birds. Almost no traffic at night. This place is for one or maybe two motorhomes, not 4 as a previous reviewer suggested. If someone is already there, leave them in peace and go elsewhere."
104614,716630,3,AlwaysReadyToRide,09/10/2019,"Quite quiet, 5 cars / day above. Narrow but charming, little stroll along the river, mushroom lovers"

104624,3045329,2,Canela.,30/07/2023,"Don't be fooled by the photos, it is a mini place with a few pine trees surrounded by houses and car traffic. We went looking for shade and space for our dogs and the surprise was that we almost had no space for ""Cinnamon"", our van. The good thing is that it has water in two points (road and in the picnic area itself)"
104624,1115226,3,F.Miranda,14/11/2020,"Good quiet place to eat or even sleep. The access is very narrow, and only van till 6m have good drive to get here. The place is very calm, but you have two big fountain very near to fill up the tanks. Very good for a bike in the nature. It has some houses around, but the people here are mainly agriculture activity. Nice place."

104644,1790400,1,gardunu,21/03/2022,The civil guard came and asked us for the data. They also informed us that the access of motorhomes such as campers is dangerous in this area. They recommended that parking be done in the AC area designated for our vehicles. So this is why I give this negative review.
104644,1415400,1,Robur,06/08/2021,"Total disaster. It's just ugly and dreary there. Thousands of annoying flies. Difficult to turn. Nothing to see. Everything weird, garbage, faeces and paper. 5 km approach on a tight serpentine. Only the road that leads into the water is access to the reservoir, the banks are extremely steep. Stones from the slope lie on the road."
104644,1171776,4,G-sus,10/04/2021,"The spectacular site, I put 4 for the little room for maneuver, but totally recommended"

104644,610265,4,RoadcarOtto,08/08/2019,"Really nice place but it's pretty tight to maneuver as long as no other car is there, so it's no problem. Further up there are a few parking spaces."
104644,459547,4,Madelaine,19/04/2019,"Pretty spot to pull over by a lovely reservoir, no facilities.  Not a lot of space, so may struggle to turn around in a big camper when there's other cars about"
104644,387063,5,Pablogueb,03/10/2018,There is little room to maneuver but enough. Go around the side of the house and leave the site free again.

104651,2556937,2,boxer60,21/01/2023,"Great parking for the day to explore around the lake. The car park was almost full when we arrived around midday and there were people everywhere, but when we returned 3 car’s windows had been smashed! We were very lucky that for some reason they did not break into our van. Be warned!"
