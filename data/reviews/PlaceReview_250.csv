13080,2660234,3,Lgodoy,10/04/2023,"We used the services, but we did not stay to sleep, since the street is very steep. The town is beautiful and the Majaceite River route is highly recommended."
13080,2654471,3,Edmugu,09/04/2023,Perfect area for services. Many thanks to the town hall for keeping it available to travelers who want to visit towns as beautiful and charming as this one. Perfect for the Majaceite River route.
13080,2607541,3,isdalu,12/03/2023,"We have not used the services but it is appreciated that they are available. The problem is that it is not a comfortable area to spend the night because it is a street with a lot of slope (a slope). It is in the same town and it is easy to access its downtown area. It is a pity that the town hall makes the effort to install services, thank you very much for that, but do not consider the area to park / stay overnight. It is clearly indicated that chocks or leveling legs cannot be used, although I think it would not help much due to the steep slope in some sections. It is indicated that the parking must be in battery, but the parking space does not measure more than 4 or 5 meters, impossible for an AC not to invade the street or the sidewalk."
13080,2596919,5,ertruji,03/03/2023,perfect!!! Good for the town hall!
13080,2588214,4,nandjgocamping,23/02/2023,"Goos service point with parking for about 15 vans. Signs ask users to park en bateria, which I think means at an angle. Many were parked parallel to the road so not making best use of the space. Close to the town and walks. We spent a very quiet night there."
13080,2580989,5,Beispielname,17/02/2023,"Everything works great when we were there, but you need a 1/2 inch adapter for the water tap, for example if you Gardena wants to connect hose."
13080,2576075,4,ermaska,12/02/2023,"Very good place to spend a couple of days, with water, well located"
13080,2512421,5,nanaisviajeros,04/12/2022,"Very well located and with everything you need, totally free downloads and water collection, everything very clean, ole by the town hall that many should take an example"

13080,2481668,5,DantePabloMe,04/11/2022,Single bay for fresh water and disposal of waste. Spotlessly clean. Turning is just before the bridge as you enter the town.
13080,2475808,1,hasenteufel,01/11/2022,Tonight at 2 a.m. we were pelted with eggs and lemons. the SP is not a real parking space because there are also many cars parked here and it is very sloping. Keilee and step must not be moved out. we didn't feel well looked after here and drove on in the middle of the night. local residents give the impression of being unwelcome. the place itself is very nice.
13080,2455769,4,ayperbla,22/10/2022,"Nice place, good parking area and emptying and filling services in correct conditions, the only drawback is that the Local Police/Civil Guard should control who parks... since there are vehicles that are not motorhomes or campers."
13080,2444443,5,M_F_A,15/10/2022,Perfect to visit the town or to stay a few days and from there do hiking trails. It has a bit of a slope but it sleeps perfectly and they allow the use of safety wedges. Very quiet and silent area at night. Thank you for enabling areas like this.
13080,2424454,5,mj230591,05/10/2022,"Thanks to the mayor and the citizens of El Bosque for welcoming us, it is wonderful that there are still places where vans and/or motorhomes are accepted. The town is very pretty and you can park anywhere (as long as we respect the rules); The path of the Majaceite river between El Bosque and Benamahoma is highly recommended, many shops with delicious food and handicrafts."
13080,1985728,4,MiguelMoya,17/06/2022,"A quiet place to spend the night and also change the waters, highly recommended to do the path from El Bosque to Benamahoma"
13080,1772196,5,beaglebum,03/03/2022,Perfect. Thanks to the council for providing this.
13080,1770404,5,AntonioNeiro,01/03/2022,"A very welcoming town, as long as you respect the rules they let you spend the night in almost the entire town, good hiking trails, we were very comfortable."
13080,1759919,4,zebest13,19/02/2022,"free services, functional, clean, perfect on the road to the white villages."

13080,1745969,4,KinitoSpiti,02/02/2022,"Free service area that is greatly appreciated to visit the Sierra de Grazalema. You can park in the surroundings or in the streets of the town, always respecting traffic regulations. The town is on the route of the white villages of Cádiz, with many routes around and gastronomic possibilities."
13080,1741897,1,fmpalo,26/01/2022,"In the parking lot they have put it on battery, you can no longer park"
13080,1738274,5,laKaty,21/01/2022,"a 10 for the town hall for its well-kept gardens, you can park in several town places without problems and I recommend the inn el maño to eat delicious"
13080,1732424,3,ladystonee,12/01/2022,"Little space for battery parking. Single screw tap, gray drain and toilet ok. The area is slightly sloping, we parked on a street in town (c / ribera del rio) and we were great. The Pico del Torreón Route is recommended."
13080,1729470,3,Chus66,08/01/2022,"It is actually a village street, with the dump area at one end, so there are parked cars that limit parking. In addition, the sign indicates battery parking, but since the space is small, so as not to invade the road, we were all parked in line. Of course, it is one step away from all the town services and the hiking trails."
13080,1728451,5,Plaeuskadi,07/01/2022,Very nice town with a beautiful and easy route (that of the Majaceite river) to do with children. the visitor center is right next to where you park. It is a very uneven street and the police asked to remove the chocks. good bars to eat
13080,1726413,5,malcon,05/01/2022,"As they have already said, it is not an area, it is a street where they allow parking, the police told some that they will remove the levelers and there is an area for loading and unloading, a very quiet area but you can park anywhere as long as you are correctly. The town is very nice to eat restaurant el maño, very good food and very attentive staff"
13080,1720122,5,miguelichi7,30/12/2021,Quiet place to spend the night. We stayed one night with several motorhomes. Close to bars and the start of the hiking trail. It is a normal street with houses but there are emptying and filling services.
13080,1716076,4,gomezfr,26/12/2021,"good place but for motorhomes / vans of maximum 6m, it is battery parking and with more distance you leave a lot of motorhomes outside. there is more certain around that they are equally good"
13080,1713187,5,raskatran,20/12/2021,"very close to bars and supermarkets, the magaceite river hiking route leaves across the road"
13080,1708760,5,goribf6,12/12/2021,"We only use loading and unloading. a good place for it, and free. The area was packed."

13080,1706714,4,plisflops,08/12/2021,"Area with all services, in a town with a perfect environment for hiking. It is appreciated that a people of these dimensions offer us these services. The streets are named after writers with fragments of their works. Recommendable."
13080,1703069,4,Depaula,04/12/2021,"First of all, thank the City Council of El Bosque for putting up a place where you can empty, fill up and spend the night. As a way of thanking us, we made purchases of local products (Meloja among others) and ate a very correct quality / price menu (€ 9 per person)"

13080,1698532,3,tarracosirius,26/11/2021,"Very nice village. It's not an area, it's a sloping street (You can't put panties on). There is to change waters."
13080,1695228,5,Drownedrat,21/11/2021,"We didn't sleep here, just visited the village for a coffee but would happily have stayed, and we used the emptying facility. Very grateful- thankyou"

13080,1678087,1,koebusje,04/11/2021,We think that residents are not happy with parking in front of their door. The front wheel lug nuts were all loosened. Very dangerous situation on the way. Reporting to the Police in Ronda was not possible. There was no one who spoke English. If only I had to come back the other day!
13080,1676904,4,oldman65xxl,04/11/2021,Spent a quiet night here and did a lovely hike. Disposed and our water supplies replenished. There are nice and inexpensive restaurants. In the tourist information office there is a permit to go hiking in the national park.

13080,1645936,3,happyflo,15/10/2021,"Parking on a street, it only has emptying services, they have removed the water filling tap, they have not left even water to clean the potti, we spent a quiet night."
13080,1640971,4,bancarrotas,12/10/2021,"Very clean, it hurts that there is no water, they have cut it, I suppose it will be due to the pandemic issue and that they will restore over time"
13080,1613407,3,Juanmax1,27/09/2021,"I have always considered the height of view of the rulers of the wonderful town of the Forest making it a reference point for motorhome tourism, until I have been this weekend and I have found that they have removed the water tap without giving any reason. A shame I hope that these rulers reconsider and put water back in (even with coins)."
13080,1593050,4,choricita,19/09/2021,Very quiet perfect for sleeping but without services a shame 09/18/21
13080,1577503,1,Antoniomaike,14/09/2021,"It is sad that one of the pioneering areas in the province of Cádiz, has dismantled the drinking water tap, depriving us of being able to enjoy this beautiful town and put it on the long list of municipalities not friendly to motorhomes ..."

13080,1172312,5,RobGreen,11/04/2021,"Quiet place to spend the night with a camper. It has a drain for gray water and filling the potti with clean water. Near the center, 10 minutes walk. Thanks to the City Council of El Bosque for enabling such an area, the other towns should take note. Every day we have breakfast and lunch in the great restaurants in the area."
13080,1161281,4,Libancito,30/03/2021,No services but perfect area. Space for about ten vehicles and a 3 minute walk from the center. Highly recommended.
13080,1144306,5,margot60,28/02/2021,"An ideal place to spend the night with filling and emptying services, near the town. A 10 to the municipality of El Bosque, this is how tourism is generated in the area. We ate and bought local products."

13080,1072221,5,Antoniozafra,27/09/2020,Filled with water and emptied of grays and blacks .... a luxury attached to the bullring. We parked and we were only 2 AC. but it is signposted to park in battery and logically the ac does not fit .. apparently if the police call a fine ... at the end of the street next to the park in C / Rafael Alberti .... we were very quiet for two nights. Thank you The forest for being so welcoming.
13080,1071898,2,MALR011257,27/09/2020,"We spent the night without problem but the municipal police caught our attention in the morning since it is a battery parking area. The place for changing waters and potty works perfectly. It is not really an area, it is a place where you can change water and a street where you have to park in battery."
13080,1068933,4,javiergalvan,25/09/2020,"The police passed by advising us to respect the battery parking in a friendly way, in fact there is a sign of obligation. respect signs to preserve the place. Thanks, IT'S NOT AREA, it's parking"

13080,779409,5,biquet5155,12/02/2020,"Area along a quiet street near the arenas and a small park. Slightly sloping. The places are very wide and you do not overflow on the road. Emptying gray and black water and water point. Very quiet (apart from the garbage truck that goes through the night). Beautiful ballad trail along the river. Restaurants, shops nearby. Pretty village. Thank you for your hospitality."
13080,777998,5,JuliaLiAr,09/02/2020,"It is a street where motorhomes are allowed. It has a certain slope, it is convenient to wear chocks It is very close to bars and the Majaceite hiking trail, which is beautiful. It is an ideal place to go with children as it has parks nearby. recommended (in winter or spring, because in summer it must be very hot)"
13080,775582,1,acuita78,02/02/2020,I don't know whether to define it as a motorhome area. It is still a very quiet street where you find cars parked with battery parking that motor homes of more than 6 meters usually park online why they stand out on the road. If at the beginning of the street they have an emptying area (gray and black) and a tap to get free water. We spent a quiet night.
13080,766156,3,Victor0909,08/01/2020,"We have spent a very quiet night. Above the street is the gray and toilet discharge area, as well as the water point. Despite what the description says, it does have water."

13080,678282,3,zukitruki,05/09/2019,"The street has a little slope, it is a bottle area, with noise until late even we knocked at the door at 1 in the morning to disturb."
13080,598153,4,RickPaz,04/08/2019,"Perfect for draining, filling (tap deteriorated)."

13080,474060,3,Laruski,02/05/2019,"Positive: water for free filling and emptying. Negative: it is a row of few parking lots, all in a row, next to a playground and apartments. There are few cars traveling, but it is not very ""cozy"" to say, nor obviously, there is a lot of privacy. Well for being free but I would not consider it an ""area"" in itself."
13080,467770,5,Labaron,25/04/2019,"Area with all services, in battery impossible to park with ACs of more than 7 meters. The town does not have much to visit but it can be a good place to go to eat, it has enough restaurants and good prices."

13080,392344,3,Jarmbike,12/10/2018,"There are people who should not be in the world of autocaravanismo. This place is next to homes, and there are people with chairs outside drinking in the street and making noise. It should not be like that !!"
13080,380391,4,pacotor,23/09/2018,"Corroboro what my colleagues say that it is a quiet area, slightly sloping, that although parking in battery allows us to park online, area to download dirty water and to fill, also free. Ole by the town hall of El Bosque, for me, perfect"
13080,374785,4,ELICE,16/09/2018,It is a parking lot where we spent the night about 6 motorhomes. Puts parking P on battery. Next to the bullring. Quiet street and next to the town and restaurant areas. We have not found any emptying or water filling. Nearby there is a Galp gas station we do not know if it can be emptied there.
13080,291206,3,djoacamper,17/07/2018,"Ok but nothing special, not really suitable for a van if you need to cook outside, therefor its too close to houses, road etc. moved to another place"
13080,263783,5,braconne16,04/06/2018,Perfect and free point of service for the full of water and the emptying of greywater and WC a simple point as there is little in this region. Besides you can actually park but it is not really a camper parking area. This can probably help sometimes.

13080,255496,4,j.brunet,19/05/2018,Be careful some by creating places give false information. It is a service area with parking day and night. You had to click on the motorhome and not on the car park. Parking next to homes but it's very quiet. Everything is free.
13080,255207,4,Zoidberg,18/05/2018,"Ideal for changing and filling waters, the tap works correctly."

13080,61816,3,luismiru,30/12/2015,"You can empty gray and chemical. You can also take water. Area as such do not expect, below there is a residential area where there is ample parking where the floor is more level and you sleep more quietly. Ideal area to connect the ascent of the port of the Boyar by bike, make the Majaceite route or see the surrounding villages."

13097,2850708,2,juandelsaz,13/06/2023,It is a simple parking lot. The area with electricity has a chain that is removed with a key stored in a mailbox with a code that they give you by calling the phone. The views are pretty. There was a popular race and music until late
13097,2840314,1,Mastrobirraio,10/06/2023,"A place as beautiful as Olvera and famous for the Via Verde de la Sierra does not deserve to offer such shabby accommodation for motorhome owners. The red zone, which is reserved for motorhomes, is invaded by cars and at night by kids with music and shouts. No control leads to these results."
13097,2761086,5,bails51,18/05/2023,"Great spot for via Verde. A ton of parks without services 5eu only 4 parks with services 10eu.
Quite a walk up a steep hill to town though."

13097,2548687,1,danymaster,10/01/2023,"Too bad, they make you pay just for being a camper or autocaravan and not a normal vehicle. On top of that, it does not give you any service in the €5 car parks. I spent the night at the hotel and they don't care if you spend the night or not in the vehicle, just the fact of being parked there you already have to pay. Olvera City Council should review that. Next time I'm going to Coripe or Puerto Serrano."

13097,2440229,1,M_F_A,12/10/2022,"A shame. It is the parking lot of the greenway. Cars are not charged and AC and camper are, €5 or €10 depending on whether you use the services. The black emptying area does not have a tap to clean the potis and we did not find a tap to fill water. Besides, everything was full of rubbish. Olvera doesn't deserve such an area"

13097,1858123,3,FeeeNdr,28/04/2022,"It does not look like a motorhome area but rather a public park with passing cars, motorcyclists, cyclists and hikers. I felt isolated because the village was quite far and the historic center 45 minutes away on foot . To sleep only because in the city there are a lot of parking spaces or parking. Why not pay 5 euros but it's not worth it at all!"

13097,1809998,1,pticlod,07/04/2022,the phone line is always busy impossible to reach anyone. I asked the bike rental company how to do it. he joined a person who said that it was only possible to park for a minimum of 2 nights. we found parking elsewhere near the greenway for free. I do not recommend this place. it looks like racketeering.
13097,1804878,5,anavega76,03/04/2022,"Very quiet, clean and ideal place for the night. Possibility of making a route along the greenway on foot or by bicycle (bicycle rental point). Restaurant the station, highly recommended."

It is not a place that I would repeat. there are other places in town to sleep without having to pay. Summary: Very expensive for what it offers"

13097,1760554,4,JoseManuelMM,20/02/2022,"Careful and safe place, very quiet with zero noise, 5 minutes from the town. The only thing missing is some services (there are some nearby but they are very dirty and sometimes closed, I think they belong to another business) because many people relieve themselves near the parking lot."

13097,1707944,3,Festin,11/12/2021,"If you arrive in time to enter the blue zone, interesting, you will have light and you can use the vacancy and filling services for only € 10. The red zone (€ 5) a simple parking lot without any service. Maybe they should let you use the filling and emptying services for the 5 € of the red zone. For the rest, at the foot of the greenway, a good bar-restaurant, but very far from the town and with an important ramp."
13097,1704425,4,orlutiki,06/12/2021,"Quieter than most Spanish campsites or aires - only distant dog barking! Shame about the campervan that ran its engine for several minutes at 01:30, presumably since no proper heater. No leafletby the time we left at 9, but put money in the box anyway. Very helpful guy who spoke good English in the interpretation centre. Take my advice and do not try to cycle up the hill to the town - very steep, but not too bad a walk. Vía verde great and well worth a walk or a cycle."
13097,1699683,3,PSH1971,28/11/2021,"Only four available spaces with electricity and all were full when we arrived at 19.00. There’s a number to call to arrange to pay (€5 for a spot without electric)  but no one answered. However someone left a leaflet on the windscreen when we were out cycling next morning, and we were able to leave payment in a small postbox under the information sign. There’s a great restaurant alongside."
13097,1681852,5,JuliaLiAr,07/11/2021,"A great site. 10 euros with electricity and water in your place. picnic next door and great views. You can take out tables and chairs (within the 4 enabled spaces). Outside there is parking for 5 euros, but without water or electricity or anything ... it is worth paying 10. The greenway leaves from there."
13097,1651216,5,aquindecisa,18/10/2021,"We really liked it, we went on recommendation. We were in the area that is worth € 5 just to stay overnight and we ate in the picnic areas. It is the beginning of the greenway, take advantage to take a bike. Quiet place. In the morning they came to collect. If you want electricity and drainage it is € 10 and you have to call a number."
13097,1648238,4,Timonell,16/10/2021,"Right at the beginning of the greenway. Very quiet, with views of the castle and next door there is an accommodation with a restaurant. The tourist girl comes over and explains tours and gives you a map."
13097,1637889,2,ArturoVitienes,10/10/2021,"The feeling we have had is of contempt towards the world of motorhomes. (It looks like the mouth of the wolf) Not a single light neither in the place of the tables, picnic area, nor in the place of motorhomes."
13097,1605076,2,raph.66,24/09/2021,"Before arriving at your destination, there is a vertiginous slope, but too late to reverse because already engaged and narrow road. We spent the night in the parking lot, quiet night. In the morning departure and go up the slope, no luck a tractor coming down. We had trouble leaving in the 1st camper van and trailer, big fright."
13097,1572934,5,rufina1953,12/09/2021,"We have been in the blue zone and it seems to us a very good area, water and electricity connection in each of the squares. It has a suitable area for draining water and is next to a picnic area that can be used. Camping is allowed. A few meters away there is a cafeteria restaurant with a very pleasant terrace. It is convenient to call by phone for instructions"
13097,1296348,4,Fitzroy,04/07/2021,"The site is well equipped for services, quiet to spend the night. The view from the picnic tables is superb. However, the site is very isolated and does not allow you to visit the city. We called the phone number and received a code to open. We were alone for a weekend in early July. A man came to collect the € 10. We were able to stay beyond 12 noon."

13097,1178029,4,Katagat,23/04/2021,"A very nice place and great place with supply and disposal as well as with electricity (10, - €) without electricity and without V / E (5, - €). A 20-30 minute walk to town or castle and church, but it is worth it. Great view from the castle. Entrance to both the castle and the church, each 2, - pp is definitely worth it! Bike and hiking trail on a former railway line 36km long with many tunnels. Highly recommended!"

13097,1054061,4,camera.en.route,17/09/2020,Spent a quiet night here. Was the only campervan and didn't pay anything as there was no water. Probably a rough break that should be repaired the same day. An ideal starting point to explore the Vía Verde de la Sierra.
13097,978695,1,JRM64,18/08/2020,Area very far from the town of Olvera and difficult to access. We will not be back. Better find a place to park the AC at the fairgrounds. Avda Iberoamerica. Recommendation of the Civil Guard if you only want to visit the town. Worth seeing.

13097,793400,3,TesoroFA,09/03/2020,"We park in the blue zone, paying 5 euros. At around midnight on a Thursday, 5 cars appeared with music blasting, skidding wheels and screaming. We left in the middle of the night. Despite this, during the day we had a great day on the Greenway. Perfect for walking, running or cycling. The town deserves a visit."

One pair of blue lights did patrol past but did not stop. MH specific area looks run down and as others have said black waste is blocked and like a bog. Might be a problem if windy as exposed on one side."
13097,425395,2,Lemmix,29/01/2019,"Place with extremely steep and narrow driveway. Departure in adverse conditions (rain, slippery road) for non-four-wheel-mobile extremely difficult.

There is a small playground for children near the restaurant. all services are available for 10 euros, when we arrived the area was closed by a chain, we must go to the restaurant nearby to pay and ask for opening. Since we did not need water or electricity we were able to park next door for free, but beware it's forbidden from June to September."

Without a doubt it is to spend a day at the beach. Keep in mind that there is a market on Tuesdays and Saturdays and you cannot park from 07:00 to 14:00."

13148,917778,3,abxo,01/08/2020,Good and safe place to stay as there were most likely about 80 campers there the night I was there. Even putting out your chairs and tables seems to be tolerated and there is a community of locals that seem to be living there permanently. They are nice but they can be a bit loud when they party at night. If you want it quiet try to park a bit away from them. There is no wind at all due to the location in the middle of the city and buildings all around. So it is a very hot place to be.

13150,2312947,4,daviniagp,28/08/2022,"We have spent a very quiet night. It has to discharge grey, black water and water tap. Good place to rest!"
13150,2302992,5,petitetribu,26/08/2022,"The area is super good, clean, with all its services working. quiet area The sweeper passes at 8:30 in the morning with the sweeping machine, even allowing himself the luxury of passing between vans and motorhomes. The emptying box is not practical, the access for motorhomes is above the curb because it is narrow. Kudos to the council for doing something like this, we'll be back."
13150,2264968,3,xesda25,19/08/2022,The parking lot was occupied by the town fair. Right now the area cannot be used until the holidays are over.
13150,2214060,4,javerago,11/08/2022,Quiet area near the highway. Emptying of gray and black water. Next to the esplanade where the weekly market is held. There are some large trees that provide shade. Close to a health center and the bus station
13150,2113845,2,Jaah,24/07/2022,"It's next to a nightclub, you can't sleep."
13150,2085476,3,cnietopr,17/07/2022,"A somewhat soulless area, a little far from this pretty town that is well worth a visit, it has all the services, working but it is a pity that the services are poorly executed with a very bad access for drainage, without separation of black and gray water and a single faucet. There is a very shaded area next to the area for the summer heat"
13150,2083114,4,Jessedu,17/07/2022,"Very quiet place where you can spend the night, it has free water loading and unloading services."
13150,2035604,4,yzacarias.cpy,03/07/2022,Quiet place without noise. Cool at night to have a good time. Highly recommended. A single drain not suitable for a large motorhome as the entry maneuver is difficult.
13150,2028564,3,baikal,01/07/2022,Highly recommended and quiet. To improve: you have to put an additional tap and the black water pool is permanently suxia
13150,2020036,4,van_142_,28/06/2022,"Parking lot is OK, but there are no shadows ar all. Did not try any services."

13150,1963857,2,CamperCliff,10/06/2022,Water supply is not working. There are some shadow spots with a little trash laying around.
13150,1909454,4,Lemarelta,23/05/2022,"all good, but very sunny. There is everything and a cement floor. I recommend it to see the town. It is very nice and quiet, there is everything and it is a very old town. Fortunately, far but there are containers to recycle. I was tired of having to throw the plastics in normal containers."
13150,1905501,3,Norfri,21/05/2022,"A wide, level, cement and little shade place. All services but the black water and gray water dump is in the same place. Everything working, I stopped by just to use the services, thanks to the San Clemente gathering."
13150,1880873,5,Maldivas,10/05/2022,"Very quiet night, one step away from the town, flat asphalt esplanade, water, emptying and garbage container. Let's leave the area clean please!!"
13150,1850851,5,Mandarindu33260,24/04/2022,"Thanks to ""this city"" for the welcome of motorhomes. nickel parking, gray water and water drain. What more...."
13150,1849076,5,jumaolda,23/04/2022,Perfect area to park motorhomes with trailers. With huge space around to park. The town is good for a walk. Its bars are very expensive since they see you coming from outside and they take advantage of it.
13150,1833305,5,VanDoleo,18/04/2022,"a great experience!! a great area, in the morning the civil guard comes by to ask if we are okay!! we will repeat"
13150,1824928,5,begopwi,15/04/2022,I subscribe to all the good comments. One is planted very large with all services. Very quiet area. Highly recommended to make a stop along the way!
13150,1809416,5,Fluga55,07/04/2022,"Great parking space for 8 vehicles - according to the classification. In terms of space, more will surely fit. Clean full V&E, all on plaster and neatly marked. Fresh water is also free. We had a wonderfully quiet night there. On Thursdays there is a weekly market about 200 meters away, but there is no disturbing noise, only fresh fruit and vegetables."
13150,1801824,5,Nita28,31/03/2022,"Very nice place. There is a market on Thursday, so it is not as quiet as expected, but there are fresh vegetables and fruit right next to the square. Highly recommended is the wine bar including bookshop and art: Escalopendra C. San Sebastián, 12, San Clemente"
13150,1796180,4,Geejay,26/03/2022,"All in working order. Clean, safe and quiet overnight. On the outskirts of the town in a very open area. Interesting town and architecture. Several banks, shops and a good sized Mercadona 20 minutes walk."
13150,1795455,2,Rarbarargis,26/03/2022,"Fine for a night, but does not feel super safe due to its location on an industrial estate. couple of cars on the property at night with loud music."
13150,1783780,3,Fredpsq,15/03/2022,Convenient for a stop near the highway and for emptying gray water.
13150,1779788,3,JessDen,11/03/2022,Dirty water drainage and water refill possible. Perfect for one night transit.
13150,1774530,3,CagouilleExpress,05/03/2022,The services are not in operation but practical and quiet to spend the night when you are on the road towards Valencia.
13150,1771605,1,JosepMCLouis,02/03/2022,A pity the neglect of this area! We were only able to empty grays. Black was cloaked and shit was literally strewn around her! A shame!!!
13150,1766373,1,Annadinamita,26/02/2022,"there is no emptying of black and you can not fill water (broken tap). We don't stay. to visit the town, better truck parking"
13150,1753083,2,jlrc,11/02/2022,"Only to sleep, it does not have any service that works, there is no water, the tap is broken, you cannot empty black water, only gray. It's a shame but you can see that the town hall has completely abandoned it and opened it in 2013. Quite an example."
13150,1741172,3,Rick.,25/01/2022,"Great for a night's sleep, then quickly back on. No possibility to discharge black water. Tap could not open without special key. Flat and fairly quiet night."
13150,1738527,4,Mbwa,22/01/2022,"Thanks to the municipality, very quiet, with services except black water, provide pliers for opening the water tap. Pretty little town to visit."

13150,1733002,4,Heatherf,13/01/2022,"Clean grate for waste disposal but water is switched off. Flat surface for parking with little passing road traffic. Two cars parked behind me for a chat during the evening, which was annoying, but other than that I would suggest this is a good overnight stop. Market day at the far end of the car park Thursdays."
13150,1728787,2,RamonKTF,07/01/2022,"Very neglected. Only a tap that has water but no means to open it ... you have to find your life to operate it. The black ones, not having a specific site in sight, can be dumped into the gray sewer, according to the legislation in this country. A pity that the Consistory is not for the work of maintaining this space."
13150,1728607,2,joanjo,07/01/2022,The squares are flat and wide. We had a quiet night. The service area is a disaster: there is only one faucet (no handle) and the chemical cannot be emptied due to lack of maintenance.
13150,1708518,2,rebelmoto,11/12/2021,"the car park is large and certainly quiet, but the services are in poor condition, black water drainage blocked, clean water tap damaged ..... I only emptied the gray water. too bad to create an area and not to maintain it ....."
13150,1707884,5,Anitabiker,10/12/2021,We spent the night on the way to Alicante and slept great. A very calm and quiet place.
13150,1698531,4,tarracosirius,26/11/2021,"As a place of passage is very good, we were 3 cars. We did not visit the village, it was night. Thanks to San Clemente."
13150,1683613,4,medicus45,09/11/2021,We spent the night in a very quiet place as we were passing through on our journey north. No noise since it is close to the cemetery. Ideal to sleep and continue our trip the next day.
13150,1681974,4,irieman,08/11/2021,Great parking lot for passing through. had a quiet night for 0 euros. Gray water disposal available. See level parking spaces.
13150,1657988,4,clauveen,23/10/2021,"First of all, thank the City Council for its commitment to these spaces. We spent the night in the van and it was great. Easy parking. A bit dirty environment that could be perfectly from the campers themselves (cans, bottles and various plastics), a shame…"
13150,1638261,5,Jhonmelon,11/10/2021,Very simple and very comfortable area
13150,1634555,4,jlnavarro,09/10/2021,Several spaces next to a very large parking lot
13150,1634513,2,miguelycatia,09/10/2021,Be grateful when municipalities decide to create areas for motorhomes. But we are not pigs either. The tap and the area for the discharge of sewage are in a sorry state. It's been two years since I was last here and nothing has changed. Regrettable.
13150,1626187,3,Bea77,04/10/2021,"Thank you for this very practical and free surplus air! Lack more than the toilets to empty. For the tap, a fork was left on the water point. A hose is essential on the other hand (the original one remained on the ground and not usable)"
13150,1612825,4,Lubin131955Louka,27/09/2021,"Thank you to the community for this motorhome area, nice little town and a warm welcome"
13150,1606499,3,fmp,25/09/2021,Quiet night. Emptying area.
13150,1571651,4,javivinai15,12/09/2021,"Thanks to the City Council for this area. it's big, shady and the air runs. allows a comfortable stop. BUT it is one thing that there is no tap and another that there is no handle. Pliers!!! What pliers? You activate the tap with the help of a fork that you will surely carry in the Motorhome and that's it! Open tap. (then you close it well). You have to take imagination to things! Hahaha. Ale! problem solved."
13150,1540970,4,joaopleao,02/09/2021,"Fairly good location to stop for a night when in route to somewhere. Stayed here for a night and cannot find any fault beside the fact that you do need a tool to turn the water tap on. In the morning, we were surprised by a local market only 50 meters away which was great to stock up on some needed items."
13150,1518684,4,Euleon,27/08/2021,Thanks to the city council for this spacious and quiet area of Motorhomes. a pity that they have broken the water tap and that without pliers it cannot be opened. The grate is opened so that the Thetford can be emptied so that the debris does not remain on the grate. There are trees that provide a lot of shade.
13150,1390617,4,Tabare,01/08/2021,Very good place to drain and catch water. We had pliers and we had no problem with the tap. Thanks to the city council for the services. We have not stayed to sleep ... it is wide and flat but it looks like it is not very quiet.
13150,1363944,2,ertruji,25/07/2021,"The tap is broken, a lot of noise from the disco and cars constantly passing, and a lot of smell from the river"
13150,1358278,5,nuriaagurain,24/07/2021,"Nice town, we have slept under the pine forest to spare, phenomenal, the area is in the sun. Quite close there is a disco, no noise problem. On the shopping street entering the Plaza Mayor there is a bakery that has gluten-free products on request, quite a surprise, since I am celiac. (Carmen bakery) the product is from Albacete. The service area is fine, except for the key."
13150,1358231,4,masakre,24/07/2021,"Good area to spend the night. The water tap does not have a crank, but you can find it right in the hole behind it, if not with pliers you can fix it. The area is next to a nightclub, but you can park all over the huge esplanade in which it is located. In tourism he recommended the wooded area that is further ahead due to the heat and we have been luxurious."
13150,1324163,2,Laurencefwi,14/07/2021,Really too dirty. hello flies. creek dry on 7/14/21 and filled with green algae and garbage cans. the water is free ... and hot. take a pair of pliers. Garbage bin available.
13150,1277954,1,pmsapt,26/06/2021,"There was no faucet, there was no water, it was impossible to empty the black water, completely abandoned. The only thing that takes advantage is the floor. Too much noise at night."
13150,1246458,4,CanKerberus,10/06/2021,"Good free area, the tap lacks the way, you need some pliers asphalt squares leveled, for my taste little shade I liked"
13150,1198692,3,Marquesmm,15/05/2021,"It does not have a tap, the dock is for emptying small vehicles, I put 3 stars because the town has an area, something that other renowned towns do not have, although they should know how to exploit it to attract more tourism. Thanks to the people of San Clemente"

13150,1092589,1,Maxi-Ana,13/10/2020,Yesterday 10/12/2020 I was without taps. It is as abandoned. A shame.
13150,1073912,2,rafaydana,28/09/2020,Look of abandoned. A little dirty. Far from the center. Nevertheless it fulfills its function. We have filled and emptied; to spend the night we have done it closer to the town since the place is quite large. Thanks to the municipality.
13150,1011820,2,elias653723,29/08/2020,"Very dirty area and with a disco 10 meters away, the music is very loud, now because of the covid it closed at 1.00 and you could sleep, how good it is that you can load and unload water."
13150,881458,5,VeroGP,19/07/2020,"Very quiet area to sleep. We spent a night passing through. Free water loading and unloading although little lighting.

13150,755917,3,JRM64,22/12/2019,"Area next to the cemetery. Quiet area although somewhat left. We have slept well. Gray water and drinking water area, although the tap was broken. Poor light."
13150,751109,1,KExplorer,07/12/2019,Awful. Didn’t feel safe at all as lots of youths loitering around and so much noise that the little ones found it hard to sleep. There was a bonfire nearby with youths playing music really loudly (they must have been using a speaker) and singing and shouting. Cars constantly going past too. If it wasn’t for our little ones needing to sleep then we would have left.

As has been said in some other comment, the worst cars are passing at high speed there. Anyway we spent a very quiet night. The emptying area a little narrow to enter."

Discharge of gray and black water (raising the sewer) and possibility of filling. The tap can be opened with pliers. There is a nearby churrería open on Sundays, the delicious cheers! In addition, it is next to recycling containers."

As we did not know what intentions they were carrying, we were quickly scared. I do not recommend spending the night without talking to the police first."
13150,172030,3,Gema324,11/08/2017,The area is very good. The tap works well. And this is as in the photos. Behind it passes a channel almost without water. The cemetery is a few meters away and about seven or eight in the morning some trucks and tractors passed by. I do not know if El Centro is near but you can not see anything around
13150,137175,5,hennecfr,24/05/2017,"We confirm the comments of ""Justelemien"" the service is complete, no lumbago to lift the grid and the tap has been replaced by a classic model. thank you to the municipality for this free area."

13150,118886,5,justlemien,26/01/2017,"Hello, After reading the comments, my curiosity pushed me to stop here to see this story of black water. In plumbing we say water valve and waste water. You understand at least what wastewater is. So after going through the question, it comes out. The construction of this area deserves to exist. Wastewater and wastewater are emptied at the same place. It has cost less to build but it is there. To empty the cassette, just lift the grid in the center of the emptying area. It is mounted with hinge or articulated mechanism if you prefer. In any case, we must bend down to empty the cassette, there is no stooge. The corner is nice, quiet, too even this January 25, 2017. The water tap works despite the morning frost. (Those who found the water cut in January 2016) is normal because here the freeze can go down to minus 10 ° (not every day lol) and the plumbing does not like the cold. I try to attach some pictures of the grid. Happy retirement to old people like me and happy holidays to those who still contribute. (Just)."
13150,118672,3,antlica,22/01/2017,Tranquility = Perfect. Drainage gray and black water without problem. (The two waters are drained by the same grid that can be lifted without effort) The water was cut that day. It was not a faucet problem ..

13187,1426051,1,Jacobroder,08/08/2021,"More than a camper park it looks like a hippie commune. In fact we paid the € 10 for the night and left an hour after entering (losing the € 10). The showers did not work, the restaurant does not have a kitchen on Sundays, the reception does not work, the reservation is made in the cafeteria. It has a tennis and gym area that is still good but as an area to spend the night I do not recommend it!"
13187,1285349,5,jybiv,29/06/2021,"When I see isaway's comment, I have the impression that he is not talking about the same area. Indalo is the area of the tennis academy, really great and price at the top. We have been going there for over 10 years. Please note that a new area is open just to the right before the entrance to Indalo, approximately 50m away. Never tested because often closed."

I recommend going to the top of the campsite as it is the quietest and most peaceful area. There are a few sinks with perfect hot showers."
13187,792230,2,IDEFIX13,07/03/2020,"3 years later we found the place as we had left it but badly aged. The wifi does not work often and in any case very poorly, the hot water in the downstairs showers is very random, the road to access even more smashed covered with dried and dusty mud like the atmosphere in high winds. In addition, management does not seem to care. Farewell."

There are 2 shower houses with toilets and washing machines. The access road is very well signposted from Lidl in Vera. To visit Vera it really needs a car or a bicycle. Walking is a challenge. The restaurant probably closed today ... Too bad ...? Here are many long-term campers have settled and their pitches individually designed. The BonnyMobil, Bonny and I feel comfortable here."

Lovely bar with excellent tapas, we had the meal of the day too @ €10 per head, this was bread, salad starter, main course, desert & coffee, all really tasty. The staff are very friendly. The nearby town of Vera is lovely & is a relatively easy 20-25 minute cycle ride away (that’s with the kids setting the pace). There’s a Mercadona in the town & a Lidl plus your usual phone shop, pharmacy, hair dressers, cafe’s & bars etc. A weekly market on a Saturday in the town square from 9-12 noon. Also a cracking park for the kids on the outskirts which you cycle past on the way in/out."
13187,225474,4,kernowcamper,02/03/2018,Not easy to find despite coordinates. The trick is locating the Lidl and then it is a case of following the tennis club signs. Follow unmade track for approx 2 kms into the campo. Aired on the left and separate campsite on right. Worth the effort. Well laid out hardstandings. Very quiet and ample hook-ups and water taps. WiFi free but weak. Receptionist welcoming.

It's in a beautiful part of the Cabo de Gata with lovely views. I would've given it a five star but for the noise - shooting all day long in the valley with the gunshot sounds echoing, and a really annoying yappy dog (s) from other motorhomes. Whilst I appreciate people love to travel with their dogs, it can really spoil it for others when small dogs yap all day long intermittently at any slight activity near it. Pity for the noises otherwise I would give it a five star review. 6 Dec 2016."

After pleasant surroundings, beautiful landscape, shower and sanitary clean, nice pool."

13205,1776018,5,Remolin,07/03/2022,"Good private area with all services. During the night I haven't heard any train, so he falls asleep quietly. The town can be reached on foot in fifteen minutes."
13205,1735647,1,burrita,17/01/2022,"The services are paid, a sink and a single shower. The owner is watching what you are doing all day, either personally or with the cameras, he even looks at your electricity consumption and comes to call your attention if for him the consumption is higher than what he has established when you already You pay for some services."
13205,1734816,3,JoseR.,16/01/2022,"A good place to spend a night and have barbecues with friends or do some DIY, but I find it a bit expensive for not having anything nearby and only a paid sink and shower. You also have the suburban railways and the AVE nearby, you can hear a lot, but you get used to it"
13205,1726955,3,McQ,05/01/2022,"So it is a nice place with supply / disposal. However, we paid 16 € for our Rosses mobile home - WITHOUT electricity! Which is much too expensive, because the railroad tracks are DIRECTLY on the property for all trains that pass every 8 minutes. We only stayed one night because it was way too loud."
13205,1711674,4,Lumi13,18/12/2021,"Nice, rustic place with nice seating and free-roaming chickens. Sanitary building functional. But close to train tracks (midnight to 6 a.m. it was quiet)."

13205,1694840,1,unicorniorosa,21/11/2021,"Disappointing, the price doesn’t match what it says. Almost stepping on the ground also makes you pay. Worst of all, it’s not the noise of the trains, it’s the total control of your movements, you feel constantly watched. I top it off when he comes and tells me to keep my dog in the, motorhome he wants to get the chickens out. jajajaja. No m, I had found in 30 years as a camper, such a bizarre situation. Not anymore."
13205,1689093,4,CamperJuulenPetra,14/11/2021,"A great motorhome to stay, everything is there what you need and more. The pitches are not too wide but enough to stand. You can also stand on the lawn or sit down with your chair, there is a lot of space! The price also makes a good impression in our opinion. We paid €13 all in, including electricity. Care place well situated at the entrance/exit."
13205,1660563,5,goneforawanda,24/10/2021,"Lovely, well maintained site. The owner will greet you as you arrive and is around the whole time so it feels very safe. Everything you need including electricity for €13, hot shower 1€/5 mins, and laundry €4. It is right by a high speed train line & the trains are loud but typically not many at night. We stayed two nights. If you go into Bellvei we can highly recommend a meal at Ca La Juanita."

And the owners of the place are not pleasant, they make you feel like a criminal since they control you closely if you put the coins in the mailbox, and supervise all your actions. Unfortunate attitude. We will not be back! Don't go"

13205,211066,2,SERGENT-NEMO,14/11/2017,"Well, the site is fine. With all the services. But (as there is always a but) the AVE line very close is very problematic. Also the buts screaming all afternoon. El'accèso to all services is with payment (disappointing) more than anything with a price of € 8 + € 3 of electricity, for this price you could include the shower at least. For the people who are not upset with the noise, it's fine."

Small defect: a little difficult to find without application because the municipality has removed the signs. The welcome, the desert of quality areas, the price, the services offered as well as the garden are all assets that will quickly forget the passage of the railway line nearby."

When you eat together, you get to talk to the other campers. For dog owners many hikes from space. The cats mentioned are only on his private property and one rarely runs across the site. A look at Franze's homepage is worthwhile."

13261,2522867,1,Boxerliese,16/12/2022,"The pictures are from a better time. Everything looks like a landfill. Cats 35 run around everywhere, including where he prepares the food for the guests. Franze probably cleaned himself thoroughly months ago. At the end of the day, he doesn't want anything to be thrown away, because it just runs into the ground. 8€ for nothing, there's better. Running around on the square forbidden"

There is no running water, no electricity, no toilets, no shower, no gray water disposal... but a dump that impresses even by Spanish standards. If you want to eat here, you should never look into the ""kitchen"", unbelievable conditions. Let's get out"
13261,2479296,5,tobolina,02/11/2022,"If you come, please check Franze's homepage beforehand, because then you will find out which ""specials"" he offers. We didn't know and therefore missed the Halloween special. But it was still a nice atmosphere around the campfire."

The owner also lets his cats and dogs roam all over the areas where he cooks. Everything dirty and not very appetizing. Also the price of 8€ for nothing is too expensive"

What a blessing in the hinterland is Franze's place! Quiet, starry sky, sun and wind. Franze brought us the paella directly to the mobile home and it was really fantastic and cheap too! Thanks!"

It’s a proper get away when you wake up to the sound of birds chattering and not a car in earshot.  Can’t comment on facilities here because I don’t need any, very welcoming host though and town only 15 minutes away."
13261,1821744,5,Paolosbird,14/04/2022,"We are here now.  What a lovely spot.  Nothing but views.  Plenty of space on the pitch, the host has brought us a plate of nibbles! Haven’t found water and dump yet so can’t comment.  (Don’t need it).Some walks around us, rabbits, birds and a few tiny houses with very friendly locals.  If you want tarmac, loads of amenities, shopping don’t bother.  If you want peacefulness and nature, it’s here."
13261,1804230,5,agetho,02/04/2022,We would like to thank Franz for the hospitality. The paella is great and gets *****. We like to come back.
13261,1791976,5,KoShamo,22/03/2022,"Great, rustic place. Franze, the place owner, received us with a welcome greeting. 2 nights became 3, because after the tajine pot we wanted to eat the famous paella. It was all delicious. We will definitely check back next season."
13261,1784656,5,RoulieOntheRoad,16/03/2022,"Very warm welcome from Franz and his wife although we did not speak a word of German. Emptying of black water is possible. Franz helps out a few liters of water for one night. Quiet night in the pampas. Very rootsy and very nice atmosphere. If you're looking for a chic spot with a calibrated service area, go your way, but if you're ok with simplicity, it's perfect!"
13261,1766547,5,BiFra,26/02/2022,"Very generous space, warm welcome by Franze and with a welcome greeting. The host regularly cooks for us campers, creating a family atmosphere. So plan at least 2 nights to taste the tagine and the paella. Both were excellent. We will be back. Many thanks for everything."
13261,1766525,5,huenerkopf,26/02/2022,I can only agree with all the positive reviews. Don't be put off by the approach. Also suitable for large RM's 12 m.

13261,1761391,4,AlbertHolzapfel,20/02/2022,Super nice place. Franz conjured up the finest paella for us. Unfortunately we could only stay one night but it was absolutely quiet.
13261,1750530,5,udokrohn,08/02/2022,"The planned 2 nights turned into 4. Franzl is a super nice, helpful operator and cooks delicious food. A campfire after the meal is a must with a good drink."
13261,1748088,5,flaquito,05/02/2022,I would be here for 5 weeks. Franz is a very nice and helpful operator who also cooks very well. eg his famous paella. I'll be back.
13261,1734527,5,Steiniknausi,15/01/2022,are today for the 1st time on the pitch and have to say we like it very much as soon as we arrived Franz gave a welcome greeting and in the evening he cooked Moroccan Tajin very tasty and tomorrow he will make everything rustic and simple for everyone who wants a pajella but this is what we want and this is perfect! He also has gas bottles to swap... Greetings Ursel and Heinz
13261,1733329,5,splinti,13/01/2022,for the 2nd time here and we would love to come back. We've always had the funniest encounters here.
13261,1715398,1,TyraenJan,25/12/2021,"owner gets angry quickly we had a problem with our gray water tank it was leaking, place to empty the cassette was very dirty in the middle of the night you can hear people walking around and talking barking dogs which is no problem for dog owners of course.NOTE NO FRESH WATER! Only a jerry can with ""spring"" water if you are not or do not speak German you do not feel so welcome."
13261,1684395,5,Dieselpumpe,10/11/2021,A wonderful place in the middle of nature. The planned 2 has become 5 nights. The trajin and the paella are super delicious. In the evening campfire and a wonderful view of great sunsets and clear starry skies. A great welcome and tips from the operator round off this extraordinary space. You can sponsor one of the trees
13261,1671545,5,Paolacali,31/10/2021,"The perfect place to get lost. Very, very special, away from everything, spectacular nights and no noise. It has no services due to having suffered a fire. Not suitable for ""posh motorhomes"""
13261,1616861,5,IrisF,29/09/2021,"Warm welcome by the operator, this is where you really get an African feeling. Starry calm night. The guest area is not affected by the recent fire."
13261,1552683,1,Ralphohnefabermitph,06/09/2021,"The place is not recommended. The place is scruffy, decrepit, neglected, weeds are rampant, most of the plants have dried up, broken, littered wooden buildings, dog leftovers, everything is scrap yard-like. The operator is not guest-oriented, unfriendly, sometimes aggressive, offensive."
13261,1250425,5,Relyat,12/06/2021,"A wonderful place. Individual and charming. 
Quiet and peaceful with plenty of space
The owner could not be friendlier or more helpful."
13261,1147143,1,avistadecamper,05/03/2021,"It seems the house of horrors, quiet place, owner not friendly, he did not let us just eat inside he said it was impossible"
13261,793314,4,Dijanx,09/03/2020,"We had a very pleasant stay here. My dogs really enjoyed the freedom of the landscape.
Franz gave us the warmest of welcome's.
This site has the best views of the mountains and surrounding area. Wow! 
The site does look different, from the pictures.
 Time has added some quirkiness. 
Really enjoyed it here. Will return with bike's next time to explore further afield.
We did arrive with full water!"
13261,784146,5,Espana18,21/02/2020,"Absolutely must if you are in the area. Very friendly welcome from Franze, superbly located, all around nature, you can actually hike in all directions, a paradise for dogs. Absolute calm day and night. Franze has put a lot of effort into the parking space. On some evenings there is paella, prepared by Franze, followed by a convivial get-together."
13261,781554,3,delaSelvaNegra,16/02/2020,"Greetings great, well eaten, landscape terrific. Ideal for hiking and with dogs, rest, just beautiful. It is best to come with a full water tank. Supply and disposal should be reduced to a minimum, fresh water is only available to a maximum of 30 liters per day in a pampy tone and with inappropriate arguments."
13261,779864,5,RackhamderRote,13/02/2020,"An extraordinary site: originality, calm, setting, absence of light pollution to enjoy the stars, the sunsets and sunrises. Warm welcome. Closer to nature: impossible !! Preferable to arrive with plenty of water and emptying done to limit the ecological impact (emptying of cassettes possible, in a clean and environmentally friendly way)."
13261,771791,2,claudine44,23/01/2020,"Nice site but very bad reception, spongy ground in case of rain. The owner yells at us because he doesn't want us to make traces with our wheels. € 8 it's expensive for no service. Not recommended especially in winter."
13261,768619,4,KallePef,14/01/2020,"Individual space for individual visitors, but also suitable for normal people ;-). Good if you have large batteries or solar (we have :-), because there is no electricity. Franze is a nice original, in the middle of quiet nature! Fantastic here on a starry night !!!"
13261,762753,4,Campscout,03/01/2020,This is really a very nice parking space on the ass of the world. You should only be careful if the operator sells his food that you ask for the price beforehand. We found a portion of lacquer with potatoes and vegetables 28.00 euros a bit expensive.
13261,744780,5,Relax2000,19/11/2019,"A pitch of a very special kind, embedded in a fascinating landscape. Warm welcome with a welcome gift from Franze, who puts a lot of passion in his Finca. Thanks again for everything !!!"
13261,741282,4,katalin64,10/11/2019,"great place very unusual !! Frantz welcomed us very nicely and with a plate with donuts, fruits and eggs that represent a smile and even biscuits for our little dog! 360 ° view !! pity that day there was a lot of wind !!"
13261,575847,4,Ixy63,25/07/2019,"Great welcome from Franze. he offered us fruit and a rose, he even thought of three cookies for our travel companion? In the middle of nothing but a magnificent view. When the trees are bigger it will be great."
13261,483572,5,blaubabsi,13/05/2019,"Franze is a welcoming host. He puts a lot of passion in his Finca Caravans and has, after a considerable hurricane in April, almost everything back in balance. Total silence at night, very relaxed two days spent there. Any time."
13261,455437,5,SarahBu,15/04/2019,A super nice pitch with very nice operator. You feel good immediately. Very nice view of the mountains. We made a nice mountain bike tour from there. In the evening cozy campfire. We will be back!
13261,442979,5,sarah94,22/03/2019,Nice parking space in the middle of nowhere! Here you can enjoy the absolute peace. We were greeted by Franze very friendly and felt very well during the whole stay. We will come back! :) Greeting Sarah and Tim
13261,439431,2,vinangel,13/03/2019,"This was a strange place. Very remote, huge pitches very warm welcome from Franz the owner but....... Franz cooks a lovely paella and invited everyone to sit around and share a meal which is a great idea. When we were there all other vans were German so we were the only noun Germans sharing the paella. Disappointingly although my husband speaks a small amount of German ( I don’t) he tried to speak with them and they all ignored us. All said they spoke no English so we felt isolated and sat in silence through the meal while they all chatted away. All were offered a beer except my husband and I and after eating we left and returned to our van. The week before we had spent with a lovely German couple whose company we had enjoyed immensely. What a contrast."
13261,437257,4,roadcats,06/03/2019,This pitch is one of the best we have visited so far. Secluded in nature. The Franze a brilliant cook and the paella just wonderful. Animals feel just as much at home here as we do. We will be back.
13261,431282,4,OurTour,19/02/2019,"Plus - Franze is very welcoming and makes a good paella. Reminds me of campsites in Morocco, basic but made with love. Daliesque / abstract art scattered around the site. 
Minus - You are a good way from anywhere. Franze will do shopping for you, but best to stock up before you arrive as its a long way to a shop. Also not much around for walking / hiking / sightseeing."
13261,422517,5,CacherTeam,14/01/2019,"A great place for individualists. We wanted to stay for 2 days and it was 10. The food offered by Franze really worth it. Every time he went shopping he was asked if he should bring something. A service without equal. For those who want peace and quiet, like to move in or out of nature with or without a dog."
13261,421408,5,ostfriese,09/01/2019,"Very quiet location, great for hiking. Nice reception and always good mood at the operator Franz. If something like food or similar. Missing, it is with pleasure and fast brought. I am feeling good here !"
13261,420422,5,connicon,05/01/2019,"This pitch is exceptional! Surrounded by wild nature with a wide view in all directions. At night a fantastic starry sky and absolute silence. The place is superchillig and imaginatively decorated. On the large plots there are comfortable sofas and small fire pits. Every camper has a lot of freedom around him. Franze, the gracious operator, attentively looks after his guests and creates a warm and family atmosphere."
13261,397844,5,vilamobil64,23/10/2018,A magical place. You have to stop at least once (and come back). What a welcome !
13261,278798,2,chundara,02/07/2018,"The man very attentive, (does not know Spanish), but the place a little weird (to say it somehow) we did not stay. It is very secluded, and there was nobody staying overnight."
13261,247080,5,Maxxbull,06/05/2018,"Very quiet place, the owner very friendly. If you want peace and tranquility, this is your place. We will certainly repeat"
13261,230516,5,jcastillejo12,29/03/2018,Recommendable ! Very attentive
13261,229402,2,agn38,24/03/2018,"Two stars for the view but too ""quirky"" to our taste. We did not stay there and continued our route Murcia."
13261,223080,5,joklagi,16/02/2018,"Perfect to finally switch off, to be free, to find yourself and to listen to what the heart tells you - holiday in a different way This pitch for all campers is unique in Spain ... beyond Africa, so is the nature and tranquility all around! Grandfather Franze is such a good kind soul and an excellent cook: Paella and Tajine ...."
13261,222961,5,maxmo,15/02/2018,"Superb place we totally disconnected the boss welcomed us with oranges, almonds, a small salad and a tajine cooked by himself and served at the camper. We loved the offbeat style of the place. If you like the peace and the nature go there, it's worth the detour"
13261,206413,5,andreasliebe,27/10/2017,"I forgave 5 stars. Error in the app. Place is highly recommended. Beautiful nature with olive and almond trees, as well as cork oaks. Ideal for hikes and bike tours. Nearest supermarket 10 km. Therefore, shop before. Very nice care by Franze. We will be back definitely."
13261,206411,5,andreasliebe,27/10/2017,"Space is highly recommended for all nature lovers. Very nice care by Franze. All around mountains, olive groves, almond tree plantations. Next supermarket in 10 km, so before shopping. Ideal for hiking or bike tours. We will be back definitely."
13261,192246,1,littleolewinddrinkerme,10/09/2017,Drove in slowly drove out in haste. Thought i was on a Vietnam war film set
13261,190327,5,muckelmaus,05/09/2017,"If you are looking for peace and relaxation, this is the place for you. The welcome is warm and you feel welcome. The finca is surrounded by nature. If you are looking for peace is just right."
13261,63452,4,forment,08/02/2016,We love this side isolation :-) But be careful not electricity or toilet / shower or wifi! Otherwise very nice to have very large locations :-) and great 360 ° views. NOTICE to the amateurs: this camperpark is for sale !! See his website.
13261,40233,1,RJ,29/06/2015,This private and paying area is in a desert place without shade. We arrive there from the main road CM 3220 by 4 km of a small road crossing beautiful fields of almond trees. the caretaker lives in a large motorhome in the area.
13261,13005,5,MLucas,17/03/2014,Area in the middle of nature. Ideal to disconnect from the world. Great value for the price.
13271,3165810,2,oceeme,17/08/2023,"What could be a magnificent place to spend the night is only a very good place to pass through. The reason is not only the garbage, but the bar plays music until 4:15 in the morning at an inappropriate volume that prevents sleeping even when parking in the furthest space. For the rest, there are almost all the services, including a shower, although the water supply does not work and you have to do it in the laundry room."
13271,3113601,3,Solife,10/08/2023,"Super welcoming and clean place, all amenities are there. Pretty little river beach. Too bad the restaurant puts techno music on full blast every night from 10 p.m. to 4-5 a.m., making it impossible to sleep even with earplugs."
13271,3080236,3,Marieange73,05/08/2023,"great place but techno full blast from 3am to 5am, impossible to sleep even with earplugs not directly in the parking lot but in another location."
13271,3008910,5,bobby29,23/07/2023,Wow!! Thank you Portugal!! This is amazing! A natural wild swimming spot that has been naturally built into the river for safe swimming. There is a little bridge across the waterfalls. A cafe/bar toilets are clean. The shower is cold which was frustrating because the sink had perfect hot water just not the shower! 10/10 quiet peaceful night. Well lit up at night also. Everyone friendly. A lady comes in her car after 6pm to sell fruit and veg/honey…. Etc
13271,2978928,5,Cesar66,17/07/2023,"A wonderful place, grass meadow, natural pool, shade, bar, it is a luxury, you want to spend more days. Highly recommended."
13271,2952769,5,Maaaaarit,12/07/2023,"It looks like a mini holiday park! Beautiful piece including lawn, trees (shade!), water for swimming, picnic tables, a restaurant across the street, a house including toilet, cold shower and washing-up area. In the evening it was quiet at the restaurant from 22.00. Everything looks well maintained and it's clean! Did not use the services."
13271,2942920,4,snoopy44,09/07/2023,"Very pleasant area near a river beach. The services are very good. As the area is near a bar, there can be music late into the night."
13271,2899425,5,inespombo,27/06/2023,Very cute and peaceful. Clean bathrooms (no light at night) cold water shower. Services running. Very big and nice. The river beach was without water but they were fixing everything for the summer
13271,2853834,5,SjesOnTour,14/06/2023,Wonderful place. Quiet and allowed. Everything is there if you don't want to leave you can stay here.
13271,2781290,4,jmd44,24/05/2023,"Probably an old campsite. Numerous services (clean water, gray water, black water, dishwashing sinks, washing, etc.), everything is functional and free. Very quiet area...after the restaurant closed. A good stopover."
13271,2744462,5,Rhithik,12/05/2023,"Lovely place, beautiful scenery. Small river flows past the place. In the summer there is swimming. Restaurant right on the water. Everything neat. Felt very good. We have been there 2 nights."
13271,2697328,5,HPM1961,25/04/2023,"A wonderful place, beautiful nature, quiet .... Unfortunately bad internet reception, thanks to the municipality"
13271,2694394,4,kanda,24/04/2023,"Lovely, quiet and not too busy. They are marking off spaces to allow locals to visit and enjoy the area. Work  (17/04/23) to improve the river near the weir for swimming. A small bar just beside. WC emptying & fresh water unit is damaged but working. It’s a lovely place to visit. Don’t enter by the village if you’re more than 7 metres there’s a very tight turn"
13271,2685647,4,alain85,21/04/2023,pleasant area free services it's spring and even here prohibition signs are springing up like mushrooms to limit pitches but because of who or what those who use too much water... maybe... or those who squat with it cc and trailer and car.. already seen here several times. enjoy shopping and market day
13271,2684047,5,Karin1974,20/04/2023,"Thank you for the free opportunity to use this natural space! Excellent V / E !!! Unfortunately, there is currently no possibility to swim, so the river bathing area is being rebuilt."
13271,2677872,5,Awen,17/04/2023,"Nice clean area. Sanitary clean, but no hot water in the shower, only in the sink for the dishes. Many accessible barbecues and a reserved and delimited place to make fire on the ground. Ideally placed next to a small park for children and a bar / fast food Accessible place for large motorhomes since we are there with a 12m converted coach Les Happy Dudul"
13271,2642301,5,Anatole22,05/04/2023,"Great place. Calme. Nice pitches in the sun or in the shade. Clean toilets. We were lucky because the emptying and full space was cleaned (unblocked) and filled with water the day before our departure. Small supermarket at 1km3. And what's more, it's FREE."
13271,2582289,5,walsch,18/02/2023,"the pitch has everything you need....rest, water, toilets, cold showers, waste disposal, good cell phone....it is very good for one or the other overnight stay, although there is nothing of interest in the immediate vicinity."
13271,2582242,5,PenJ,18/02/2023,"What an excellent site and its free with plenty of parking space on reasonably level if slightly rough ground. All the services for motorhomes are available, even the Euro Relias Mini's water supply was on in February. There are indoor toilets plus an outdoor cold shower with BBQ areas adjacent. There is a café across the wooden bridge over the R.Moinho stream. We had a quiet night's stay."

13271,2451236,4,jmv89,19/10/2022,"Still as good, but the place for the ccar has been reduced. it may be understandable in summer but in winter .... Everything was clean when we went."
13271,2327534,1,FNunes,01/09/2022,Very dirty after a festival. Which was done here last week. The river beach has no water.
13271,2320934,3,Eltorado,30/08/2022,Hippy Village. Not for everyone. I have never seen such dirty toilets. The night - quiet.
13271,2261973,3,omotecoolninja,18/08/2022,"Great place to bivouac where the pitches are spacious and certain in the shade. Waste water and cassette drains are clean and free. No electricity. The toilets and showers are clean and located nearby. The pretty river beach is pretty but the water level is down, the reception of the snack bar is great. Thank you to the municipality and have a nice stay in Portugal."

13271,1762343,2,MissSchwertfisch,21/02/2022,An overkill of parking bans that force RVs to park in the shade when there are no other visitors - shade is no fun in winter. I drove on..

For large motorhomes and trucks, it is necessary to come by the national road that comes down from Guarda. We talked with the traders of the village.

We had no problems in removing the table and chairs for breakfast, I suppose that in high season it will be limited. We were very comfortable and in a very good area to go to the beach or take the camí de ronda. There was toilet on the beach and lockers but we did not see water intake or showers"

Suitable for vans with a maximum (!) length of 6m. —> Dear drivers of larger vehicles, please drive to a parking space that is suitable for you. It is absolutely antisocial to stand across several parking spaces here. In good weather and on weekends it gets crowded here and then the locals can no longer find a parking space."

13301,1722388,3,bikesonworldtour,01/01/2022,"I can only agree with some of the commentators. this is one of the most beautiful kite spots in Spain, especially at Levante. however, the behavior of parking lot users is characterized by selfishness. Incidentally, the beach toilet is right at the beginning in the small wood. Large motorhomes are best placed lengthways to take up as much parking space as possible. you can stand here for months."
13301,1714054,1,mara66,22/12/2021,Very nice place but it seems to me that a little common sense on the part of travelers would allow this spot to last ... Parking bans (places reserved for emergency services) are not respected ... some park long and monopolize many places to the detriment of others and locals ... the spot deserves 4 stars but user behavior does not.
13301,1594031,4,leaodapraia,20/09/2021,"A car park where many motorhomes park. Free park that normally would have a height barrier but for now this match.

13424,3051782,1,kiko1985,31/07/2023,"Careful! They fine you 200 euros if your Camper does not have a home vehicle approval. The police admit that anywhere in Ansoain it would be lawful for us to spend the night, but if you go to the industrial estate they won't tell you anything. In short, if we had parked elsewhere as a tourist we would have received a fine for something else. We did not park in the parking lot in the center because there was a 60-euro fine. We won't be back."
13424,2833101,4,huisbus,08/06/2023,"Have used all the facilities here, great. Not a cozy place to spend the night, so we didn't. Ps in the library, a 5-minute walk from the parking lot, you can go to a well-kept toilet for free."

We did not see any misuse of the 72 hours restriction which is great to see. This is how these excellent facilities will keep operating. We walked into the city in approx 20 min. Plenty of facilities as mentioned in other posts. Peaceful stay all round."
13424,2627478,5,AlboGando,28/03/2023,"Perfect place to spend 1 or 2 nights visiting Pamplona! There is a sign mentioning parking is allowed up to 72h. However I believe some motorhomes are permanently parked there...
Not a lot of spots but arriving before 3pm you should find one!"
13424,2625182,3,Hambe21,26/03/2023,Stayed overnight here in February. Was finding it very difficult to find a suitable park up in the region. This is a busy town carpark overlooked on all sides by flats. I was a bit wary initially but had no issues and a very quiet night. Bakery near by in morning which was very welcoming with enormous croissants and good coffee. Friendly community.
13424,2625018,4,Linnert,26/03/2023,"For free. Ideal for visiting the city. Shops and local transport nearby, very clean, supply and disposal options. Not quiet until the evening because of the location in the residential area, but not disturbingly loud either. quiet at night.

Bus 11 takes you down the street and takes you to the center in 10 minutes. level squares. I don't give it five because in the end it is surrounded by streets and there is traffic and it is a bit far from the center on foot."

With an outside temperature of 35° in August, you can hear every noise from your neighbors. The mopeds rattled through the streets until 1:30 a.m. The parking lot is a mixed lot. At around 6.30 a.m., many cars are already driving off. Hardly any rest to sleep. Opposite is a good bakery with a café."
13424,2213237,3,neusmar,10/08/2022,"Only for motorhomes and residential vehicles. The rest of the places, at night and on weekends, are only for residents. Around also all green area / residents. Consulted with the police, you could not spend the night if it is not with a motorhome. If you go with one, fine. You can stay up to 72 hours and there is a bus stop, very close, that goes to the center of Pamplona."
13424,2211063,5,dovig,10/08/2022,"Very practical parking area with area for emptying and filling.

It is a vacant lot where in one area there are 9 ac spaces, but in the rest everyone parks and there is a lot of movement and noise. We parked to go with the bikes for a ride around the center and we left because the place was not quiet at all. Thanks to Pamplona for the initiative."

The drain of the black water is very high, so in addition to gloves you may need a raincoat and a good stomach.

Be careful with snow season because if you go in the afternoon-night to be there the next morning it can happen that you can not take the motorhome until the afternoon because they park so many cars that make the exit maneuver very difficult.

Convenient loading and unloading services. No electricity. For large campers, it is best to park on the pitches on the left of the entrance to C. la Cerca. Close to the historic center, recommended for visiting Baeza even if it is very noisy"
13463,2783878,5,GeorgyBoy,25/05/2023,Secure parking. near bus station. They start driving at 6am.
13463,2782132,4,SiraQuiroga,24/05/2023,"Free, level and 15 minutes from the Plaza del Pópulo on foot. Enough spaces for at least 20 ac. The downside: the branches of the trees are very low and make some spaces useless, which is a shame. If they do not control them, they will even prevent access without touching you. Thank you Baeza, it is well worth a guided tour with one of your companies, taste and buy Virolos and try the ochíos"
13463,2777661,3,AlvaroyMaria,23/05/2023,"A place to park and free services is always appreciated, especially if it is as close to the city center as this one. However at night we had a lot of difficulty sleeping the only night we spent there, as it is located next to a bus station with a lot of activity."
13463,2767729,3,Jlm1956,20/05/2023,"Very noisy wedged between a large parking lot and a bus station not very relaxing, too bad"
13463,2764285,4,Kernigit,19/05/2023,"Next to bus station and a busy road, so a bit noisy, but great for visiting the beautiful town, one of the best we’ve seen in Spain."
13463,2743461,5,Fjroldan70,12/05/2023,"It has a capacity for 24 motorhomes, very easy to access even with long vehicles. A 10-minute walk from the center, it has all kinds of services nearby, bars, shops... Baeza is beautiful, I recommend doing the Paseo de las murallas. It's next to the bus station, but for me this is not a problem. Congratulations to the town hall and its inhabitants of Baeza for this extraordinary area."
13463,2738041,4,Paulette2999,09/05/2023,"Clean parking, near the center (max 10 minutes on foot) On the other hand quite noisy because right next to a bus station, at 10:30 p.m. there were still buses leaving the station and in the morning engine noise and coach back-up alarms around 7 a.m. Gray water service available and drinking water"
13463,2728177,4,carmenconsa,06/05/2023,"Although it is next to the bus station, it is a very quiet place, each parking lot is divided into 2 and separated by hedges, drains and drinking water taps. 20 min walk from the center."
13463,2727579,4,patriciasab,06/05/2023,Pkg well placed to visit the city. Very noisy at the end of the day. Quiet on Saturday morning. Functional services.
13463,2726573,4,F.Alvarez,06/05/2023,"We stayed a couple of nights, it is next to the bus station, so it has a lot of movement and noise, although bearable. A walk from the center"
13463,2719523,4,agustinmariano,03/05/2023,We use it as parking to visit the city. highly recommended. The plots seemed spacious and with trees. Good sensations even to spend the night
13463,2699050,3,Eric690,26/04/2023,the locations are perfect with access to services. but close to a bus station with maneuvering coaches equipped with audible reversing signals. Very noisy.
13463,2696639,2,pasandvan,25/04/2023,Perfect for visiting the city. We didn't sleep or do the services. The black water drain seemed clogged.
13463,2690334,5,sisilapomme,23/04/2023,"We spent the day in baeza. Very beautiful city, lots of monuments to see. Good restaurants. Good parking with all services next to the bus station. Well located for visiting the city."
13463,2682438,4,javyalonso,20/04/2023,The area is very well located due to its proximity but quite poorly planned: next to the bus station and with the rubbish bins attached... too much noise for how good it is in Baeza. Extra reflection: why do some insist on removing chairs and tables knowing that it is not possible? Neither here nor in other countries. Then we will regret.
13463,2680040,5,Pacomonzo,18/04/2023,We visited last week and we were quiet and with all services 5 minutes and 10m away. From the historic center highly recommended
13463,2667846,5,Aigory,13/04/2023,"Very good area. Perfect to spend one or two nights and visit the city. In the afternoons it is usually full, but in the mornings there are gaps. Next door there is an unpaved parking lot that allows overnight stays."
13463,2654177,4,Danifb,09/04/2023,"Thank you Baeza City Council for this area! but it would go very well, firstly, prune the trees, it is a danger when maneuvering, more than one could tear off their antenna with them!, secondly, could you monitor more the young people who are going to drink at the bus station? between their talks, laughter and the music of the cars parked in the bus area, impossible to sleep!"
13463,2651993,5,JuanySonia,08/04/2023,"A clean area, with hedges and trees that gives an environment of nature, paved ground, close to the center, supermarkets, bars..., shops in general, and the bus station. We have visited Baeza at Easter and everything was wonderful, processions and spectacular drumming."
13463,2645911,5,ando90mg,07/04/2023,"We arrived on Holy Thursday around 5:00 p.m. and there were no free places. We take advantage of the emptying and filling. You can spend the night on the unpaved esplanade that is in front. Recommended, 5 minutes walk from the historic center."
13463,2645450,4,LaLuisa2020,07/04/2023,"Well paved area delimited by hedges, very good impression upon arrival, near the center 5 minutes walk but you can't sleep with so much noise, having the bus station next door and a cafeteria with tables on the street, it attracts young people still not wanting to go home to loud music from cars and voices before 7am. Good area, although it is not the best site."
13463,2641452,5,MartinFidel,05/04/2023,"A monumental and welcoming city, thanks for the service provided for the ACs."
13463,2637499,3,hilger,03/04/2023,"Place near the city is good, almost never get a place. I think many people take longer vacations here. Almost no departure in two days"

13463,2624412,5,Fco.Aparicio,25/03/2023,"Congratulate the Baeza City Council for the area...with services for filling clean water and emptying gray and black water. Most of the places occupied by foreigners who take out chairs, tables and loungers with stays of more than a week. At the moment free, with the excess of abuses it will become a paid area. Very close to the center, all services very close."
13463,2619774,5,HelmutMeyer,22/03/2023,"Large, straight and clean parking space with supply and disposal. The city center is within walking distance. The pitch is fenced and is located between two streets. Thanks to the city for this free overnight stay."

13463,2602325,5,wassmer,08/03/2023,"Very nice free paved area spacious location with hedges to separate. all comfort except electricity. in the city center but without noise because the road is not very busy. town with beautiful cycle paths. watch out for the trees at the end of the pitch which are a little low and can scratch the motorhome, march being careful nothing is impossible"
13463,2600055,4,Atoarredondo,05/03/2023,very good only one drawback they were afraid that pruning the trees you have to be careful with the branches
13463,2597050,4,protector,03/03/2023,"Quiet and calm at night. Perfect for visiting the city. The service is also top notch. Of the minuses, there is a bus platform with peaking buses and a crazy city screaming all over the street."

13463,2587005,4,Alix06,22/02/2023,"Very nice area, thank you to the city! We just stayed there for the day to visit Baeza which is a very beautiful town and do some shopping. Watch out for the black water drain which is a few meters from the taps and not below as some seem to have thought."
13463,2585954,5,RandiSvendsen,21/02/2023,Excellent. And Baeza was so nice - we will be back and spend some more time.
13463,2585676,5,sciroco,21/02/2023,"Perfect, an area as we would like to see everywhere. Many thanks to the city of Baeza. ?"
13463,2584977,5,sscantalapiedra,20/02/2023,"A great area, very close to the center. We spent a quiet night until the noise of the buses started in the morning (something normal) around 7:00 in the morning. The beautiful city and its gastronomy and people of ten. Thank the city council for taking us into account. We will return without hesitation"
13463,2578520,5,Franzini,15/02/2023,"recommended, thanks to the cumune"

13463,2568864,4,MA39,05/02/2023,"Good to spend one or two nights, 20 minutes to the center. On the night from Saturday to Sunday, there was noise from cars and kids shouting and honking. But ok overall. Going down the promenade you can go around and reach the monumental area."
13463,2565996,5,Andycar,01/02/2023,"Very good area, with wide and well delimited squares. Ideal for getting to know the city by taking a walk. It is next to the bus station, but they are not a bother. Bars, churreria, Dia supermarket right next door."
13463,2564820,5,Diferal,31/01/2023,Great area. Near the center. We didn't even find out about the bus station to sleep.

13463,2551751,5,alejomolero,14/01/2023,"Magnificent area, spacious, quiet and close to the center, a 10 for the Baeza town hall"
13463,2549308,4,AntonioNeiro,11/01/2023,"Super cool area. The only negative that we saw is that there is only one tap to load water and to wash the poti, they should also cut down the little trees because they touch the roof and sides of the AC."
13463,2539169,4,SantosOrtega,03/01/2023,"Good area but somewhat noisy, next to the bus station. About 15 minutes from downtown. Thanks to the Baeza town hall."
13463,2534290,4,Serbumm,30/12/2022,Perfect to visit Baeza. Near the center. Filling and emptying of water. He confirmed that it only has a tap.
13463,2533370,4,herve34,30/12/2022,Paved area behind the bus station. Completely free with the possibility of emptying. Unfortunately only one tap to clean the toilet cassette and fill up with water. Fairly quiet at night. 10 minutes walk from the old town.
13463,2531510,5,afineta,28/12/2022,"As a super good area, wide, flat, very comfortable places, the only thing to say something to fill water there is only one tap that has little pressure and there is only one… .. (I suppose cleaning the potty and drinking water should be well separated) one for each thing, even so eskerrik asko Baeza"
13463,2516790,5,Van_essa,08/12/2022,"Great free plot, with the center accessible on foot. Much quieter than I imagined. Great initiative from the town hall."
13463,2515372,4,Pepapal,07/12/2022,"It is excellent that the municipalities put free areas of this type. Perhaps a little noisy as it is next to the bus station, but it was not a problem for us. The only aspect to improve would be to put a different tap for filling water and for cleaning black water."
13463,2514648,5,king3tris,06/12/2022,"Very good area, excellent despite the objections we had due to its location wall to wall with the Bus Station. Good rest. Just 10 minutes from the pedestrian c/ San Pablo, where you can see the first palaces. It is worth eating at the restaurant ""La Clave"", just a couple of minutes from the area, inside the building of the Ciudad de Baeza Musical Group."
13463,2509581,4,Xansa,30/11/2022,"The place is central and comfortable, divided into large plots of two, separated by hedges. It has a water change service. During the day you can use the toilets of the bus station and the sports center behind. The only drawback is that it is noisy being close to the bus station, with the traffic of cars, buses and people, but during it is generally quiet."
13463,2509214,5,Sjoberg,30/11/2022,"We spent four days here for free, very nice!"

13463,2507462,5,jraulrs,27/11/2022,"Free public area with all water services. In some car parks there may be a height problem due to the trees. We have been quiet the night from Saturday to Sunday and no problem. However, the area adjoins the bus station. I understand that, depending on the day, there could be noise. It is a 10-15 minute walk from the center, very nice. It has a Dia right in front of it."
13463,2505552,3,EGPH,25/11/2022,"Very convenient for visiting the city center but absolutely not recommended for sleeping. Not so much in the evening (all quiet during the week) when early in the morning, before 7 the station buses stay on for a long time, people talking loudly, garbage trucks and traffic, lots of traffic. The services are functional even if we didn't find them particularly clean, maybe it comes first, it should have more respect!"
13463,2500798,2,reisande,20/11/2022,"very nice parking but in the wrong place, a lot of noise until late at night and again before 7am in the morning, and as mentioned before, stay away from drinking water, toilet pollution"
13463,2500220,5,Blaidelta,19/11/2022,"Very central and clean, with emptying and filling services. Thanks to the Baeza town hall."
13463,2498862,4,wilmarja,18/11/2022,"Neat asphalted place with all amenities. Unfortunately, there is 1 tap where the toilet is flushed and water is tapped (so not recommended). Supermarket at 50 meters. During the day a lot of ambient noise until about eleven / half past twelve in the evening. For those who are sensitive to radiation: you are standing under strong LED lamps with hard light."
13463,2493802,2,Klaus1956,13/11/2022,"Wanted to drive to the square today, unfortunately the trees are so low and not trimmed. Still possible for 2.8m high vehicles, everyone else gets scratches. It's a shame that the city doesn't maintain an actually beautiful square accordingly."
13463,2485883,4,MartaCabellos,06/11/2022,"clean, comfortable, a short walk from the historic center. the bad noisy, being in a transit area and next to the bus station."
13463,2482965,4,etapacampera,05/11/2022,"Very good idea the separation by hedges, spacious area and well located. Negative there is only one water tap to clean the toilet and to load water, they should put one for each thing."
13463,2481928,5,MariaAtzori,04/11/2022,Thank you City Hall of Baeza!
13463,2476187,4,RocioManzano,01/11/2022,"You sleep super well, no noise even being next to the bus station. the only bad thing is that it does not have to empty the gray water or refill water."
13463,2471456,5,toneticuc,30/10/2022,"Spectacular area. A 10m walk from the center and around it has bars, supermarkets, etc. Thank you Baez!!!!!!"
13463,2468531,5,Maradull,29/10/2022,"It's very good, there are about 20 spaces, paved and a 10-minute walk from the center. It is next to the bus station and a sports hall. In front of the station there is a breakfast place that is very good, good toast and churros! Anpa cafe. there is also a Dia supermarket 3 min walk away."
13463,2468138,3,SanVega,29/10/2022,"10 minutes walk from the center, clean and with wide spaces. We arrived at 9:30 pm on a long weekend Friday and there were still free spaces. It is attached to the bus station and there is quite a racket. Some fight between drunks and youngsters at dawn. It doesn't have a bathroom, you have to go to the one at the station, which is closed all night. Gray water is in the same place as clean water."
13463,2466184,5,5reisende,28/10/2022,"I spent a comfortable night here after touring this and the neighboring town. My little mini camper needed all his confidence to stand between all the buses. The toilet is in the bus station, closed at night and accordingly, but better than none."
13463,2462517,2,voltaire31,25/10/2022,"The drain area is not well maintained. It is indicated the presence of toilets that we did not find, perhaps those of the bus stop but closed at night."
13463,2461934,4,BGMobil,25/10/2022,"Ideal stop to rest or visit the city. Nicely landscaped with hedges and trees that will hopefully provide more shade soon. Thanks to the city for this place, so much more relaxing than the chaos on the shores."
13463,2460284,4,josemleon2,24/10/2022,"It has everything to be perfect except for the black emptying area. For the rest, it is wide, level, illuminated and very well located to discover this town and its impressive heritage. Thanks to the town hall for thinking of us."
13463,2456640,4,Pilargg48,22/10/2022,"We are visiting Baeza in a motorhome and we stopped in the area, which seemed very nice and very central, but I do not give it a 5 because it lacks a tap to rinse the WC. It seems very unhygienic to me that it has to be done with the tap. clean water We don't use anything. We went to Úbeda that there is separated"
13463,2456078,5,BrisndsdeMendoza,22/10/2022,"Many thanks to the municipality of Baeza, the area is spectacular, central, flat, paved, clean, very well lit. the immense water change plaza. the paired parking spaces surrounded by hedges to give more privacy. the downside is the proximity to the bus station, from 7 in the morning there is a non-stop noise and heavy traffic on the road."
13463,2454197,5,TxusBB,21/10/2022,"Thanks to the town hall for this area for motorhomes, near a nice and pleasant city, the service of filling and changing water / wc is well done if the person who uses it is a little intelligent and thinks about what will come later, yes It is one of those that does not care about everything, it will do it wrong, use your hose to clean the cassette. the trees need pruning at the height of the ACs"
13463,2437532,2,Steberoe,11/10/2022,"the place is great but I wouldn't take any drinking water here and all water drains are full with toilets, we drove on"
13463,2408268,5,ivecocamp,27/09/2022,"AC super good, with some shade, and very new, the area is not very noisy despite being in the urban area, the center is about 10 minutes away on foot, so I consider it to be in a good area, some of the squares have some inclination, but not too much."
13463,2408086,5,javierteco,27/09/2022,"Super good. clean, nice, spacious, central, free and the visit to the town of 10. Have some tapas at Casa Paco la guinda. Many thanks to the City Council of Baeza. Things to fix indicate better to empty black water and above all put another tap (there is only one) to differentiate filling and cleaning of water"
13463,2400554,4,Paichi,24/09/2022,"We went to visit the city. The area is fine, but I find it quite noisy to stay the night. The day we went it had rained and the smells were very ""alive"", it gave me a little bad vibes to be there longer than necessary"
13463,2400111,3,parknight1731,24/09/2022,Beautiful area pitches well delimited by small hedges. On the other hand very noisy even at night because next to the bus station and the cars are running the engines. You must also pay attention to the branches of trees which are low and hinder maneuvers
13463,2391941,4,Mojolibra,21/09/2022,"you can empty your toilet, there's a hatch near the gray water spot. you can just empty the toilet. great place, supermarket around the corner."
13463,2378886,4,surroundedbydetails,17/09/2022,"Thanks to the city of Baeza for providing such a nice place. They really made it feel comfy and honestly, we barrenly noticed the bus station next door. It’s really worth to stay here for 2 days to explore the city. You can fill up water and empty your grey water tank easily in the provided area. Only bummer … why not add a little spot for emptying the toilet as well? However, great place."
13463,2311616,1,gubattel,28/08/2022,Place to forget. The town is worth a short visit of a few hours but it is better not to spend the night there. I keep coming and going of cars with nocturnal noises in a kind of passing street. People who enjoy popping firecrackers and a bus depot with vehicles that start the engine. Better to look for other places to sleep
13463,2269663,5,AndresSaavedra,19/08/2022,"we spent one night and one day, very good area, no electricity, we don't need it either, if I had to make any comments, it wouldn't be negative, just a suggestion, prune the trees that rub against the roofs of the motorhomes, thank you very much Baeza"
13463,2221039,4,GusHigueruela,12/08/2022,"The site is magnificent. I have spent one night and can only speak highly of this area for AC. More than 20 seats, water, gray and black areas. It has supermarkets nearby and the walk to the center of the town is very comfortable and interesting. The only downside I can put is that it is right next to the bus station, and the usual noise of such an installation is unavoidable. Many thanks to the municipality."
13463,2189696,5,bimbaraner,07/08/2022,"Good area, ideal if there was an option for electricity (for a fee). Good location for visiting Baeza, a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
13463,2130864,4,marisolss,27/07/2022,Good area equipped with gray and black water emptying and filling. Very quiet at night. It is essential to visit the town and have tapas in its many bars. The historic center is a 10/15 minute walk away. Many thanks to the City Council for its construction.
13463,2127646,5,MTormenta,26/07/2022,"Really nice facility with generous parking bays and planting with some shade.  There were toilets in the bus station when open, and it also has a good bar, which was very popular when we were there as was the heladeria opposite.  Short walk into Baeza town which was very beautiful and definitely worth a visit, particularly the Cathedral."
13463,2063503,2,KatjaSuster,12/07/2022,"This is just a parking space with big park lots,may be good for big AC that can't park elsewhere.It is located right next (more like on) the main bus terminal,which may be quiet at 2am,but very very noisy soon after.There is just a spot for dumping water and a water tap only there.There is NO TOILET on the spot,maybe there is on the bus station,but the busy as it was we didn't want to look for it"
13463,2018064,5,pablojog,28/06/2022,Very quiet and beautiful… it's a pity that the hedges and trees are still small and don't provide shade. In a while it will be a spectacular site!
13463,2001687,4,alineetmedi,22/06/2022,"very well located, nickel location and everything is free."
13463,1995848,5,Pepa,20/06/2022,"Very spacious, quiet, central squares and it also has a churrería 300 meters away (dovecots) that is worth it, you can walk to the center, when we arrived there were many motorhomes with tables outside I do not know if it is allowed, thanks Baeza"
13463,1971956,4,p4nseitz,12/06/2022,"A very nice paved flat place. The evening stroll in the historic town was impressive and is a short walk from the pitch. Despite being next to the bus station it was ok in terms of noise on Saturday and Sunday mornings. If there was electricity, I would give it 5 stars."
13463,1967389,5,Ginesvw,11/06/2022,"Extraordinary camper area. Very good location and services. Good initiative from the town of Baeza. We loved it, we will surely return. THANK YOU"
13463,1967371,3,danebette,11/06/2022,"Nice area, in a while, when the trees will have grown, there will necessarily be more shade. Ideally located for visiting the city which is worth the detour. 3 stars because too noisy for us. The main road, the bus station right next to it. After all, we can't have everything: everything was free."
13463,1959345,5,pericoGR,08/06/2022,Recommended area with delimited places and with the necessary services for a motorhome. Located next to a monumental urban center that is well worth a visit. Thanks to the municipality

13463,1954779,5,Pawers,07/06/2022,"Large squares and a beautiful town that deserves a visit, especially the historical part. The noise from the station is acceptable, it doesn't bother much to sleep. The sewage discharge area could be improved, which is a box on the ground and apart from the fact that it splashes, you only have the clean water intake tap available, otherwise it is an excellent area in a beautiful town."
13463,1949199,4,trastorno,05/06/2022,"Large and very good area. With many seats. Baeza is very beautiful, it deserves to be in the town and explore it quietly. All the services are free. I don't give it 5 stars, because being next to the bus station, first thing in the morning you can hear the bus engines. Relatively close to the tourist area of Baeza."
13463,1934637,5,Erpit99,31/05/2022,"Quiet place, near a very tasty churreria and with an emptying/filling area. Ideal to spend one or two nights."
13463,1930943,4,ericsanchez,30/05/2022,for parking nothing to say perfect but for the emptying area a single tap for clean water and toilet cassette moreover some people confuse the emptying of gray water with that of the toilets located under a hatch right next to for novices this allows a confusion otherwise the area is ideally located with a beautiful landscaping effort thanks to the municipality of Baeza
13463,1916881,5,jrjoe44,26/05/2022,"Very pleasant, clean, partially shaded car park and small separation hedges. Quiet at night. Wc in bus station but they are average otherwise It's free with services. Supermarket at 60m, town center at 800m. Thanks to the city of Baeza! It's perfect. And to top it off, Baeza is a superb city."

13463,1867925,5,txistufly,03/05/2022,"Nice area, 2 motorhome sets distributed by different ""plots"". The only source to fill the water and clean the black water, they could improve that, the rest is great"
13463,1864277,3,Mmmoustic,01/05/2022,Well organized area. The day buses make a bit of noise but it's not a problem. Quiet night. A gym next door where you can see a basketball game on Saturday evening.
13463,1864251,3,jamigui,01/05/2022,"very good for visiting this remarkable little town, but location a little noisy at night especially with the road to Ubeda next door.. and only 1 tap to fill up with drinking water and clean the toilet cassette it's still a bit fair..."
13463,1857633,5,nomadazaca,28/04/2022,"A spectacular area, the squares are separated by hedges every two. The loading and unloading area is very wide, and the site is very accessible. Thanks to the Baeza town hall for treating us so well."

13463,1838229,5,tonigoyi,19/04/2022,"The site is great and very close to the center, the only thing is the noise of the buses, but it is solved with some earplugs. We have eaten at the bus station restaurant that is very close to the area for €11, the menu is very good"
13463,1825766,4,txu-txu,16/04/2022,"Good place to sleep and visit. Only one faucet for water and toilet, bad. Well located site."
13463,1824344,4,sgllobre,15/04/2022,"a very well located area, with free water and emptying. One drawback is that there is only one faucet and the chemical must be rinsed with the same filling faucet and there is only one faucet for everyone. otherwise great, 10 minutes walk there is a laundry €4 wash 12 kg washing machine and €2 dryer 20 minutes that is super dry and great"
13463,1823978,5,ClaudioMartinMena,15/04/2022,"A great area. Always full, but quite busy between 9:00 and 11:00. Afterwards it is difficult to find a place, although outside there is plenty of space to park and spend the night. The water tap in the emptying area has a small thread and a push button. Baeza is beautiful to visit and from the bus station many leave for Úbeda. You have to get the tickets at alsa.es."
13463,1821261,5,fcoivanpm,14/04/2022,"good area, we slept next to there is a parking lot, but very quiet. Two drains"
13463,1818071,5,Alicialapoo,12/04/2022,A 15 minute walk from the center and next to the health center and the Civil Guard. There is plenty of room because when the spaces are filled there is also an esplanade and another empty car park next to it.

13463,1785800,5,oldman65xxl,17/03/2022,"Spent a very quiet night here. The bus station didn't bother us. Ideal for visiting Baeza. This morning from 08:30 the hedge was cut and a leaf blower was used. Supply and disposal is very good, you need a small adapter for the water tap. Bakery across the street. In front of the entrance is a large gravel parking area."
13463,1785050,3,fredletaz,16/03/2022,"Parking in town. Practical and functional emptying area. For CCs with a trailer, only one space allows parking, the one at the bottom opposite the drain, which is a little wider. Relatively calm night quite noisy day. Huge street lights all around. Thank you to the municipality for these facilities."
13463,1783312,5,alain1979,14/03/2022,"The area is not 5*, but everything that surrounds it makes it so. It does not have 5* because the emptying of sewage is quite bad and uncomfortable. It is true that it is behind the bus station, but it has little traffic. It is 10 minutes from town. 2 minutes away there is a bakery and a restaurant called La Clave with a dessert of olive oil ice cream on chocolate soup that is brutal. Thank you Baez!"
13463,1782972,5,ParkPriscilla,14/03/2022,Many cities can take this as an example. And it doesn't have to be free.
13463,1778557,2,Papy45,09/03/2022,"Calm ? Surrounded by 2 avenues that run like a highway, a stadium on one side and the central bus station on the other: find the error. Without counting on the behavior of certain German motorhomes who take the air for a campsite or the small hedges for a tin can drainer. OK for services, visiting the city and spending the night with earplugs."
13463,1776782,4,dzt,07/03/2022,thank you for this air to the commune. easy access to the old town. central café theater in the old town to discover do not hesitate to have a drink you will be surprised.

Con: it is attached to the bus station, from 6 in the morning a lot of noise from the buses and voices of the employees."
13463,1767279,2,corinne62,27/02/2022,"Noisy on the bus station side, better to park in the car park next door"
13463,1765482,2,DRS,25/02/2022,"Pros: Level seats, with all services and a good location. Cons: Noisy, the filling with water is exasperating, only a tiny trickle comes out, there are no shadows yet, the trees are small."
13463,1763318,4,yopicar,22/02/2022,"Well located for visiting the city, the squares are large. We did not spend the night there, but during the day a lot of traffic around the area, between a car park and a bus station, hence 4 stars"
13463,1762827,5,Libertu,22/02/2022,"I slept very well despite the bus station, and I'm actually sensitive. Next door is not only a large Dia supermarket, but also a China shop where you can find everything you need. Diagonally across from the bus station, on the corner, is a café with delicious coffee specialities. There is also bread and rolls. And a very clean toilet. On Tuesday there is a market very close to the pitch, lots of clothes, but also dried fruit and olives and the like. The city is very beautiful."
13463,1760670,3,travel_bnmr,20/02/2022,"Great that a city offers something like this, would also more than recommend it, but it's really noisy Saturday night, and its right next to a bus station, so you get woken up by a roaring engine from a bus. The town is beautiful and the bars are nice, and within walking distance."
13463,1760283,5,Nines_9,19/02/2022,"Good area, near the center and with many squares. To put a snag, the trees are very low and in some parking lots they can't park motorhomes, only vans."
13463,1757829,5,MarilinaRibas,16/02/2022,"Great area, very well located, very large spaces, good access to emptying and filling. Very close to the center to go for a walk and visit the beautiful town of Baeza. A 10 for this area. Better than the one in Ubeda, which is smaller, but equally comfortable too"
13463,1751721,4,JuandelaCruz,09/02/2022,"It is spacious, easily accessible and close to the center, which can be reached in a walk of about 15 minutes. The plots are large, level and well defined, close to a supermarket. A good place to stop and enjoy this beautiful town, the only thing missing is to put a different tap for clean water and black water. Thanks to the municipality of Baeza"
13463,1746613,4,Josetxu.1,03/02/2022,"Good parking, level, well defined and clean with services. Close to the historic center that is like traveling to the past of how careful it is! Right next to the bus station but there are not so many buses or so much noise to bother. The night is very quiet."
13463,1743914,5,JoseAntonio101,30/01/2022,"well leveled area with some noise from 7 in the morning, 10/15 minutes from the old town, brutal the sensation of the surroundings of the cathedral seems to move you to the Middle Ages"

13463,1741862,4,ngau,26/01/2022,"Very good spot to visit Baeza and have a good night's sleep, but expect to be woken up in the early morning by the bus station next door. The services would be perfect if there was an additional tap for clean water."
13463,1739172,4,dickndan,22/01/2022,"Although this lovely purpose built Aire is next to the bus station so there can be some noise from early morning it's still highly recommended. Dia supermarket next door, great cafe and patisserie across the road and only a 10 minute walk to the historic centre. Grey waste point and fresh water on site. Free."
13463,1735806,5,Perryneta,17/01/2022,"We stayed the night of 09/01/2022. Very good place to sleep near the center of Baeza. Ample seats, clean place. The City Council is thanked for these spaces. As downside: the noise from the bus station from very early, but without more."
13463,1731804,4,Kasku51,10/01/2022,"The area is fine and will be better when the hedges and trees grow. The squares on the side of the station are completely level, those on the other side have a slight unevenness. Tonight from 6 in the morning noise has been heard."
13463,1729031,3,thylae,07/01/2022,"Nice practical area but noisy because of the buses nearby the Spaniards are very talkative even at 6 am, but we were well next to the beautiful city and with everything you need to drain, beware the water tap requires a small diameter to be able to be connected to the pipe"
13463,1728862,5,paologallo77,07/01/2022,"Amazing area, gratis, safe, we slept well close to the center. If I have to suggest a place where to spend the money you didn’t spend in the parking area, pay a visit to K novas in the main square. I went there for a coffee and a churros in the morning and went back for Lunch: Chuleton, beer, wine, gintonic and coffee…service was fantastic! Elia the waiter and maybe the owner ? Was great! Cheers"

13463,1715623,3,patxoneta,25/12/2021,"Close to the old town. Beautiful town, well worth a walk. The wide area, with quite a few flat and large squares. Being next to the bus station, there is quite a lot of noise from early in the morning."
13463,1712628,3,jlpc,19/12/2021,"Delimited, pretty, flat, but what a shame to have to hear the buses at night when they reverse two meters with the pi, pi, pi, pi. If you are a deep sleeper you will hear something, but those of light sleepers are going to wake up. The black box at ground level is also not cool, you have to take it where it is flooded, or that there is only one tap for everything. A shame because otherwise it is very good"
13463,1708868,3,povilas393,12/12/2021,Very noisy place since bus station is so close. Parking lot us ok. Watering filling could be better.

13463,1663307,2,henkenelise,26/10/2021,Only 2 stars due to the noise from the bus station next door. See also all other comments on this. Slept well because there is no bus traffic at night. 07:00 in the morning the noise starts again. But for a night and a visit to the medieval center it is definitely worth it.

13463,1638801,5,amrtrigano,11/10/2021,Perfect area to visit the city. We did not spend the night and neither did we empty or fill. I approached to see it and as the colleagues say the tap and drain is the same to fill and clean the plotty. If the area is filled next door there is a field of land. I imagine that they will not prevent them from being there.
13463,1631654,4,jyk56q,07/10/2021,"Very nice area well located near the center, but the environment is very noisy in the evening especially, slept well between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. on weekdays"

There is no tap to clean the poty and the sewage drain hole is a bug hole. The clean water tap is also damaged. Maintenance is seen to be absent. I do not understand the good opinions of other colleagues. It is close to the center, but that is not all it values"

There are surveillance cameras in the surrounding area belonging to the Academy, which gives it extra security. It is appreciated that both Local Police and Civil Guard are dropped by the area frequently. We spent one night surrounded by 6 more motorhomes. The negative thing is that they park cars and many times they occupy places destined for our vehicles and that the lights of the street of access to the area come on very late (I imagine that due to the change of schedule) and you have a dark section of about 100m that when You come back at night, it's not cool. 10 minutes from the center of an amazing city that deserves to be visited."

The first thing the policeman told us was: common sense! What we must be clear about is that it is not a campsite or an area ... watch out for awnings, camping, chocks or they will end up banning it ... we respect the laws ... and above all we do our needs on the sites adapted, in half an hour I have already seen two watering the trees! these last days I see things that I do not like!

13491,2436574,5,NekoNek,11/10/2022,"Quiet place, with plenty of parking and safe. The seats are practically flat, with a chock you leave the AC completely flat. There were ACs of all sizes."

13491,2408709,3,vandonorte,28/09/2022,"We slept here on 09/20/2022. To visit the center and Calle Laurel we went to the Intendencia street car park but then we moved with our t5 to Las Norias. In one of the corners there were several cars, despite being parties we slept quite peacefully. You hear the traffic first thing in the morning."
13491,2389606,5,cervantes,20/09/2022,super large quiet car park that can accommodate a multitude of motorhomes except tonight... with the harvest festival of St Matéo the car park is also crowded with the circus and Luna Park next door... it's complicated. otherwise it's nice
13491,2372348,5,rubio_minina,14/09/2022,"It has become the ""unofficial"" area of Logroño and it seems perfect to me. It is much better for staying and spending the night than the one that has the services and is located about 150 meters away and it is appreciated that we are allowed (thanks, Logroño!). Still, there are people who do not respect and deploy camp without any shame."
13491,2369057,5,susana.f.perez,13/09/2022,"This car park is perfect for spending one or more nights. given that it is not a car park dedicated to motorhomes, the direction of the pitches must be respected. the police often come by to check. It's a shame that some motorhomes take advantage of spreading out like at the campsite (table and chairs outside) because it harms everyone and it will still be prohibited parking"
13491,2365086,4,MF1,12/09/2022,Great shaded area and free there is a funfair in the designated camping area - very quiet night - there were over 40campers here-   the area is so large you would fit a few hundred!!

13491,2358951,5,Malpica,10/09/2022,"Awesome space. With lots of room and lots of shade. The center of Logroño one step away. Step notes to the illustrious mayor that parking users have put the ""do not disturb"" until 9.30. Send the sweepers elsewhere."
13491,2358095,5,irenezzurita,10/09/2022,All very well. Plenty of space for any motorhome and a quiet night. It is true that street sweepers make noise but it is the best option if you are in Logroño.
13491,2350554,1,Anarutera,08/09/2022,A good idea that at 7 in the morning they start cleaning with sweepers. It's 8:15 and they continue. They are seeing that it is full of motorhomes sleeping and they have been sweeping for more than an hour. I don't know if they do this daily or how often... but you can't rest here.
13491,2347711,5,vicmbarbero,07/09/2022,Perfect place. It is shaded by trees and there is a hole since it is a very large parking lot. At the gates of a swimming pool with well-kept facilities.

13491,2319536,4,elpoyo,29/08/2022,"Large parking lot with lots of trees providing a lot of shady area. With a bike lane that you can go to the center or visit Logroño on the banks of the Ebro. Ideal for visiting the center or Calle Laurel. There are people who don't know how to respect it and they think it's a campsite, with people like that it won't take long for the city council to close it down or limit it in height."
13491,2303984,5,JosePardo,26/08/2022,"Perfect to visit Logroño, a lot of space and with shade. Pools next door and about 15 minutes walk from the center."
13491,2303600,5,Territorio_Kiro,26/08/2022,"Little more to add, large with lots of shade and perfect for visiting the center Just remember that it is not an area or a campsite.

13491,2298699,5,Saseali,25/08/2022,"Parking ideal for the shade it has and the environment, it has a lot of bike lanes to go to the center and spend the afternoon in the pool, which is very good for 8 euros. At 100m there is the area to do the services."
13491,2298158,2,orugasonroad,25/08/2022,"The area is perfect, but at 7 in the morning they started working with a blower right next to the parking lot and it was impossible to continue sleeping."

13491,2276521,5,rubenautol,21/08/2022,"Extraordinary parking with shade and many holes. 15-20' from the city center and at the very entrance of some spectacular swimming pools. Paying attention to other comments, let's respect these places that leave us free and let's do things right, without parking where you can't and respecting the rules."
13491,2274132,5,annasaiz,20/08/2022,"Quiet, flat and shaded. 15' from the center. Important to respect what other comments say: do not park campers/ac in the lanes in front of the pool, we leave this space for the locals, the parking lot is huge and this way we will avoid complaints that could harm free spaces like this."
13491,2272921,5,esterlovesyou,20/08/2022,"Great, shaded and very well located. I don't see much of a future for it since people take out tables and chairs, relieve themselves on the lawn... and throw garbage in the bins that are full. There is a container at the beginning. Civility or we will run out of zones"

However, there are at least 10 motorhomes parked across the street occupying more than one space, tables and chairs outside the motorhomes and I have even seen two children with their bikes in the parking lot as if it were a campsite. Then we will say that how bad is the Logroño city council that has closed the parking to motorhomes. How much Sunday tourist!"

13491,2159920,5,carlavilar,02/08/2022,"Good area to park and spend the night. To avoid problems, we parked at the other end of the car park as there are many local people who park here to go to the pool… this way they will continue to let us park here due to the proximity of access to the center, lots of shade and tranquility!!!! Thank you Logrono"
13491,2155546,4,Raulitoicarlinya,01/08/2022,"Good shaded parking! Next to the municipal pool and 15 minutes from downtown! Do not remove chairs or tables, they will end up prohibiting the entry of vans and caravans! Park away from the pool!"

The others are fine"

13491,789402,5,padraigl,01/03/2020,"This is NOT an Aire but basically a very large normal carpark under trees with NO dedicated parking for motorhomes. 
Saying that and with the motorhome reversed in between the trees the motorhome is down on the front which suits our shower drain.
We moved here after parking at the official Aire and a woman who was doing the services advised us to move here. We were the 2nd motorhome here on a Friday until around 7pm when there were 15 motorhomes in the space of an hour. On Saturday this increased to 30. 
About 50% of the motorhomes were parked sideways and on Sunday morning around 8am before the market got going the police made them all move and park into the car spaces further back. The carpark close to the market is very busy on Sunday morning so it's best to park well back. It's not busy at all during the weekdays. 

I believe the police don't mind motorhomes parking here as long as they don't obstruct cars parking for the swimming/sports center and during Sunday market.

There are no services here only a few small bins. The free services are at the Aire 2 minutes up the road.

Between the carpark and the river is a swimming park/ sports area. 
We completed a 3.5 hours circular walk (sourced in wikiloc) out to the low hills with stunning views. 

The town center is 15 minutes over the pedestrian bridge. It gets very busy with a good atmosphere during the weekend evenings. There is a bus stop near the entrance to the swimming/sports center.

We spent 2 quiet night here with no issues. 

Pros:
Free parking.
Close to the town center.
Local restaurants, cafes and bars. 
Great shade.
Walking and bike paths.

Cons:
None."

13491,674216,4,01cooperl,03/09/2019,A large car park with trees to shade. It's fairly quiet however the roads can get a little bust on a weekday in the morning. We had some boy racers at 6am which wasn't ideal but maybe we were just unlucky. Logrono is beautiful!!

The ""people"" not only take out tables and chairs but even put hammocks from one tree to another. It looks like a ethnic camp. Unfortunately the irresponsibility of some that we will all pay.

It must be done at the other end of the parking lot. If there are many motorhomes you have to park in battery and not in line to use less space. If the motorhomes bother the users of the swimming pool they will stop allowing parking. Thank you all for complying with the recommendations of the logroño police. It is a good for everyone.

It’s quiet, shaded and has a decent breeze blowing through. The parking lot is on the campus of maybe the biggest health club I’ve ever seen; options for anyone of you need to workout or relax. There is a water fountain in the W/SW corner of the lot and is a quick bike ride into Logrono. It would be a little bit of a walk but still doable."

13584,3163605,4,EnricoSport,16/08/2023,"parking on asphalt slightly sloping there is a gray and black water drain with relative clean water load , the location is small and you can get around in one day , in the upper part there are cheap restaurants , the stop is worth just to go to dinner at [ El tigre ] where you eat fresh fish at a very low price"
13584,3091914,3,Talapeche,07/08/2023,"Very nice clean and spacious paved place, the services are minimal, water tap out of order, gray and black water drainage present but you have to look carefully, nothing is indicated. Big problem at night, the place is lit by many powerful streetlights, and becomes the gathering of young people from the neighborhood late at night .... It is possible to stay 7 days but .. no thank you ...."
13584,2831965,5,marzar,08/06/2023,"great news, although the actual camping car parking is closed off due to the building of a designated toilet block (looks like showers also) and I can see cabling for EHU. you can still dump black waste, and get water by the steps up to town. the new facilities will soon be finished, and we have been told you can still park at far end of carpark till it's finished, even on market day."

We had to change places because of the annoying people. For the rest, a very spacious place and only 3 motorhomes are fine. The town is a bit narrow and many slopes."

The supply and disposal is currently being renewed, so it can only be used to a limited extent. For disposal of the toilet, a lid can be opened on the floor in front of the sign with the rules (it is labeled WC and has a metal handle). A nice place, you can hike. But we didn't stay overnight."
13584,2677736,4,labarotte38,17/04/2023,"A huge and quiet car park, a typical town without too much traffic, a canyon suitable for an easy 4 km walk, a hot thermal bath 2 km away... You have understood it, you must reserve at least two days in Alhama. only downside today: the emptying area is under construction and no filling possible. so this step will only be better"
13584,2666828,3,felixroller,13/04/2023,"The town/city is worth visiting. Highly recommended, the guided tour lasts about two hours and is very interesting. The area is well located, relatively close to points of interest, but be prepared to climb hills. They are improving the area of the services to empty. I suppose they will also install a faucet since there was currently no water filling point."
13584,2637921,4,Zagal75,03/04/2023,"Absolute peace during the two nights staying in this area. The empties are fenced but the tranquility of the nights makes up for everything, not a barking dog. I highly recommend guided tour of the city"

services are there but toilets closed."
13584,2623694,2,OscarHevia,25/03/2023,"I do not consider it totally an area because it lacks clean water and the toilet container cannot be cleaned for the same reason, the terrain is wide but with very few flat places, in most it is necessary to use wedges and even then it is difficult to level. and the existing fixed toilets are closed, I think the council has little interest in improving the facilities."
13584,2616608,4,HelmutMeyer,20/03/2023,Nice quiet parking space with a great view and supply and disposal. Thanks to the city for this free overnight stay.

13584,2606653,4,henkenelise,12/03/2023,"Great beautiful place with a beautiful gorge in front of the door. Toilet building is sometimes open. clean water tap is under the 3rd sink and is almost invisible. chemical toilet drain is under a lid at the glass container. They can indeed improve on that. Similarly, the sewage system cannot be discharged into the river without a new treatment plant. Occasionally you smell something"
13584,2600679,4,frantep,06/03/2023,4 parking spaces in the first location with the best view. Gray and black water as others have described in the front left of the square. I haven't found fresh water yet. We're still exploring the city today.

13584,2582130,2,pacolo,18/02/2023,"It does not deserve the green color of the motorhome area, since it does not have the minimum services for such recognition. It is also very close to the sewage discharge of everything in town, since it does not have a treatment plant and sometimes the smell is quite unpleasant, but the town is well worth a visit"
13584,2579457,4,shadowz,16/02/2023,Nice walks around the town. Stunning scenery. Plenty of fountain water points.  Good phone signal at parking. Only let down by other campers trying to park 60cm away despite huge parking area.

2 parking stars: it's a slope in all directions: bring the biggest blocks to level your camper! Along the fence facing the town is level! WC disposal hard to find (no toilets here) as is the potable water (with a very short mounting) people are parking over it making it useless! Last night I moved because of 2 black cars eyeing my camper."

It's enough of so much prohibition against our vehicles. We have loved the town, we have eaten every day in the bars here and we have bought typical products. Thank you Alhama. We will definitely return."

We were eating at ""Bra Ochoa"" everything was very good. Thanks to the City Council for facilitating access to cars, I do not give it 5 stars because access to clean water could be improved by putting a fountain, I believe that water is wasted with a box on the ground."

But other motor home owners have given us the information."

Close to town, albeit uphill, but a beautiful town full of history, with walks through gorges and ancient streets.
The temperatures may not be as high as on the coast but the scenic beauty makes up for it.
If you want to get away from the  hub hub of the coast, this is the place for you."
13584,1740240,4,ladystonee,24/01/2022,We have been four days very well. I don't give it five stars because the water tap is hidden in a box and it's uncomfortable. The hydrotherapy route to the Pantaneta is recommended.
13584,1735473,4,sayradan,16/01/2022,"Magnificent place to spend the night, there is gray and black water to release but we have missed a water tap. Very nice town to visit and a quiet place with beautiful views"
13584,1728703,3,Holundermann68,07/01/2022,"Well, ok to stay the night if you want to see this beautiful place or if you are in transit. Otherwise not recommended, toilets locked, the cats apparently like to use the cars as such. Smells abnormal and you take this gift with you. The hot spring of Alhama is also no longer active or diverted, you can no longer bathe in the pool at the moment."
13584,1726353,3,Van_Benson,05/01/2022,Many thanks to the city for the opportunity. We were one night. There were about 10 others there. Unfortunately there were parties celebrated and firecrackers or was popped. Therefore 1 point deduction and the other point deduction because it is quite oblique.

We had difficulty because an AC was parked on top, it is a box that has a hose to lift it. It can also be identified because there is a black hose on top. Highly recommended place and environment."
13584,1710076,3,Travelers,14/12/2021,"Been there today. Parking was completely empty, also the tap for water was not found. The intention was to go a little further up to that hot spring. Unfortunately there was no hot water and it was dirty. We then drove back to the coast."

The place is clean and makes a safe impression. All other campers were further down, the parking lot is completely empty outside of the market times."
13584,1686605,3,rafagonzalo,12/11/2021,"Wide and level esplanade at the back. Free area with loading and unloading of water. A garbage container would be missing since there is only glass, paper and plastic. We also miss a tap to clarify the ""poti"" next to the black discharge. Thank you very much to the city council for thinking of us"
13584,1681608,5,Muevete4wdfortheworld,07/11/2021,"The site is well located, it is quiet, there is where to get water and where to empty the gray and black, at the back of the car park is where it is flattest, and hiking trails start from there."
13584,1656864,5,andreasliebe,22/10/2021,Great pitch. Area at waste containers reserved for campers. The rest of the place only buses. The picture is deceptive. Normally 2-3 campers. Space for max. 10th market on Friday 8 am-2pm. You can stand still. Threaded tap under cover plate to the left of the container. Toilet cast under plate with handle to the right of the container. Quiet at night. Max. 7 days. Great gorge and hiking trail behind the village.
13584,1645267,4,VanFather,15/10/2021,"Good and safe place to stay the night. Drinkable water, calm and nice. Thanks to Alhama for this place. On Fridays there is a market from early morning so park close to the garbage container."
13584,1479531,3,RAQUEL1,19/08/2021,"We slept alone, only one camper arrived at dawn. The only place to sleep in the town, but not recommended due to the excessive noise: road, people with motorcycles, place for walks and meetings, tractors, etc."
13584,1436499,4,Luzelektrikopalue,10/08/2021,"The ample parking lot, with two trees per month, is appreciated for the shade they create. it has all the services but they are hidden. the gray water sewer and the black water are to the right of the garbage containers. The source of drinking water is at times to the left of the containers. The sewers need to be filled with clean water and drained black water. It also has toilets but we found them closed. The tourist office is close by"
13584,1206883,5,Milagroneta,19/05/2021,It is a wide place with a certain inclination in some parts and next to trails and the town. at night you can sleep without problems. we recommend it

We will be a few days!"
13584,1155682,4,LinenWes,22/03/2021,Great place to empty / fill. Two manhole covers at the waste containers. Lift the manhole cover to the left of the waste containers to refill drinking water. Lift the manhole cover to the right of the containers to empty the toilet. Gray water will flow into the ledge by itself.
13584,1152452,5,michaeldg,16/03/2021,"Excellent place to spend a couple of nights (7 is allowed). Water and disposal slightly hard to find, right of the trash containers is the black water disposal, left of the containers is good tasting drinking water with very high pressure.

Thursday morning we had to move over the huge parking lot due to market. Not mentioned so I guess this is temporary to make space for the flu pandemic fear."
13584,1137543,4,BertdeBus,14/02/2021,Great place to stand overnight. We were here on a Saturday evening and a lot of people from the neighborhood gather on this square. The curfew makes it quiet quickly. We were the only one here.
13584,1103431,3,Mariuge,23/10/2020,We have spent a quiet night. It is appreciated that there is a space to spend the night.
13584,1102645,3,Baltimortel,23/10/2020,"We had a pleasant night with only two other CCs at the end of October. Unfortunately we wake up at 8:00 am Friday morning with the installation of the market with the obligation to move. No sign, nothing to indicate it."
13584,1096402,4,cell,17/10/2020,"Ok, I think they would have to put a tap to be able to charge better. It is tilted. Otherwise correct."
13584,1073844,4,gesui,28/09/2020,"Good initiative of the people. But it is necessary to delimit and limit the gray water and drains, and the collection of water. The tap is to the left of the recycling bins in a chest on the ground. If you don't know, you can park on top without knowing it. Charming town, we stayed 2 very quiet nights."
13584,1031064,3,stayfree11,06/09/2020,"I recommend Cultural route with the guide Silverio. And El Tigre bar. Otherwise, area as described below."
13584,909368,4,rimorico,29/07/2020,"Huge and quiet esplanade for all sizes of AC. Emptying (gray and black) and filling. No electricity. The place coincides with the market, so you have to free up the space on Saturday. Without shadows, immense sun. From what I see open all year. Thanks City Council. It is recommended to see the Roman bridge a 15-minute walk away."
13584,897912,4,vallilli,25/07/2020,"Very good site. Friday mornings market, you can not enter. The regular services, I could not find the water tap, nor to wash the cassette. Quiet place. Good churros at the bar el churrero. The very nice cuts. Very good views."
13584,843722,5,Anus,01/07/2020,Congratulations to the city council for providing us with this wide area and with all the services.
13584,816954,5,Peran,04/06/2020,"We have called the city council and they have told us that without problem, we can stay, except on Friday that there is a street market, everything very clean and well-kept, thanks to the City Council and the people."
13584,794255,4,FUB,11/03/2020,The parking spaces are in a corner of the large square. The VE is special but everything is there. The gray water channel is in front of the parking space sign. There is a round lid for the toilet between the shield and the gutter. For fresh water you have to look 10m to the left. In the second place is a square lid under which you can find a fresh water tap. Nice old town. Nice hikes possible.
13584,779423,3,Luzie2018,12/02/2020,"Those who are sensitive to electricity should avoid space. I couldn't stay there. The space itself is not bad, it is just a sloping concrete space where you definitely need wedges. There is a toilet disposal, but I didn't look at it. Is a floor inlet. There is no water to rinse the Toi-Box."
13584,773519,4,cazstodd,28/01/2020,Black and grey waste by the autocaravanas sign. Fresh water point the other side of the bins. When we arrived at 1600hrs we had the place to ourselves so parked by the view at far end of car park.
13584,763987,4,javeasteve5,04/01/2020,"We spent two nights here arriving on a Thursday, we parked in aire with no view, 3hrs later police moved all others to aire due to Friday market.  For black waste you lift a circular drain cover next to the grey water drain. There is no water at this point to rinse cassette.  For water lift the square drain cover in the floor at the end of the first bay next to the bins.  If you want to leave during the market give it some thought when you park up.  No noise other than clock chimes, no boy racers, no loitering youths, even the market traders were reasonable setting up.
The thermal baths and the Gorge walk are both about half hour away in opposite directions."
13584,744159,4,hannahhannah,17/11/2019,We spent a quiet night here with 3 other motorhomes. Can’t comment on the services or lack of as only required parking. Stunning views and great location.
13584,737664,2,gloombuster,03/11/2019,"A nice free aire, but there is no water available as it has been removed/vandalised! Toilets locked permanently. Grey and black ok. We had a bad night here with the forever annoying Spanish youths congregating very near the motorhomes and suffering their shouting etc until the early hours. Ear plugs required! Avoid spa at weekends as packed."
13584,737479,5,nocillastrip,03/11/2019,We did night on Saturday of the November bridge. About 10 Camper and caravans. Quiet night.
13584,732212,4,maguforever,28/10/2019,"Absolutely recommended in the low season. Without toilet or shower facility. No Ver.- or disposal option, but safe and quiet. Gladly again."
13584,710867,1,upupa_van,02/10/2019,"The services are really mediocre, HS, good to review."
13584,691442,4,anaisma,15/09/2019,"Free area with water: lifting the casket that is a little above the containers, under one of the squares next to the earth wall, use hose hung on the metal fence because the hose is cut. Emptying grays on the rack and blacks raising the box next to the rack. Use the container that is in the parking lot, do not litter in bins!"
13584,691252,4,anaisma,15/09/2019,"It is a beautiful town with a lot of history, I recommend guided tour of the City Hall € 3 with entrance to the main buildings. Surrounded by tajos and the Alhama river, beautiful surroundings to make several paths, one reaches the hot springs. Regarding the area, free, the services are closed, uneven but in the background beautiful views and on this occasion quiet to sleep. Friday market14"
13584,686032,2,elvi,11/09/2019,"The town is beautiful but I did not like to spend the night because we were alone and at 1:00 in the morning there was a car with very loud music and young people shouting, not for us but for the houses around that was all silent, it is a shame to allow those energumnos to do what they want on a Wednesday. The next day we went with the ac to the thermal pool of the spa."
13584,659803,4,simba25,26/08/2019,"The water is cut from a casket a few meters above the containers, it is to open the casket and give way, with what the faucets work. The area is very uneven, if you do not place yourself at the bottom of the annexed fairground, you have to put on footwear"
13584,601707,3,yglpactat,05/08/2019,Water does not work anymore
13584,600311,4,yglpactat,05/08/2019,Not seen a ban between June and September as mentioned above. We have just spent one night without any problem.
13584,573023,1,Cyrilmartin2.0,24/07/2019,Forbidden to the camper between June and September ATTENTION! !!!!!!!
13584,482219,4,iseroi,12/05/2019,"Super parking very flat on the bottom, several trails starting from the top of the city past the old mills. For the services, they are at the top of the car park in the small triangular point, it is summary but it helps"
13584,478251,4,mjviajera,07/05/2019,"Nice place. Park to know the mountains. Extraordinary views Hot springs, .... Know the road to Vélez. It is worth the trip."
13584,477746,4,padraigl,06/05/2019,"The official motorhome parking is beside the services but the ready of the carpark used for the market on a Friday is huge. We parked looking out over the gorge. Even though it looked the most level part of the carpark I still needed chocks. The rest of the carpark is sloping.
We had a quite 2 nights and no dogs barking.

This town is on the side of the gorge so most streets are steep. 
We walked to the lake following an easy to follow path. It took about 1 hour. We did not get to go to the hot springs which was a shame.
Found fresh bread in the local Repsol garage on Sunday morning as all shops were closed.

The are full services available with 2 taps tied to chain link fence, a black WC drain and a grey drain.
The black WC drain is under a small round manhole with a bar to lift beside the grey drain.
The left tap is for fresh water and is a medium screw-on. There are large bins also.

The only drawback while we were there, were the amount of flies. At one stage we had about 40 flies in the van. The motorhome next door had the same issue with flies as we found out next morning."
13584,467749,1,mimi65,25/04/2019,I add.21:30 the police made us change places tomorrow c the market. back near the service area. dogs barking at night will be hard if it continues ...
13584,467327,4,mimi65,25/04/2019,"You have to look for services, everything is next, 2 taps hanging on the grill left more to the right for the toilet, the plate to lift is 1 m forward, metal bar to lift, good trip"
13584,467086,5,delavegaRT,25/04/2019,"Hello everyone, beautiful place, very nice walk in the gorge that runs along the old town, there are all services, I recommend (Christine Robert)"
13584,455817,4,devonbird,15/04/2019,"This is a lovely town to visit as has been said before. The gorge walk to the lake is terrific and there’s a fantastic bar near the lake to help with the return walk. Just to make a correction to a comment before about the black drain being blocked: please note that the square drain with the grid is NOT a WC dump, next to this there is a small round drain cover with a handle, this is for toilet waste. The water supply is a little primitive but works."
13584,450213,5,chickpea,07/04/2019,Large car parking area with all services. Sloping so will need ramps unless you can park at the bottom overlooking the gorge. The services are all located at the carpark entrance near to the recycling bins. A market is held on Fridays so motorhomes are asked to park in the service area on Thursday evenings/ Friday mornings. The town is lovely with many bars and restaurants and shops. Quiet at night.
13584,448252,2,DanWhyatt,02/04/2019,Large open car park but not flat. Services very poor. Black water drain blocked. Fresh water looked in bad condition. Peaceful night and within walking distance to the hot spring.
13584,445859,5,jardinier25,28/03/2019,No problem. all services. just look everywhere !!
13584,442197,4,northernraider,20/03/2019,"Nice town, nice walks through the gorge, good views, plenty local shops, free services, well worth a visit."
13584,439721,4,juridi,14/03/2019,"full area with a little tilt that is solved with wedge clean waters emptying gray and black, quiet and with garbage cans and recycling"
13584,433502,4,martincr,25/02/2019,Wide municipal area with all services. The blacks are drained by lifting the circular casket that is near the grid of the grays. It is indeed uneven but the chocks can be used. Highly recommended the guided tour from the tourist office for € 3. Thanks to Alhama for offering us this area.
13584,433271,3,ontheroadmitknirge,24/02/2019,"Nice to offer so many pitches from the community. all in an inclined position. Supply and disposal for free, thanks. not great, but okay for one night. the barking of the dogs is not bad"
13584,427856,2,MaudGus,09/02/2019,There is no installation to drain black water from where the 2 stars. Many dogs bark very regularly. We go our way
13584,427510,3,Peran,08/02/2019,"Very good place, friday flea market does not park in the center of the park."
13584,422601,4,LaLata,15/01/2019,Located in the village with beautiful views. In the village you can find all the services. Emptying of waters. The parking is somewhat uneven. The toilets are closed (low season). We have spent a quiet night together with two more Ac. It is appreciated that it is free.
13584,414811,2,Txetxumd,18/12/2018,"Good place to spend the night, although it is necessary to fit the AC in almost all the parking. The emptying is not recommended since the town does not have a sewage treatment plant and see everything in the river."
13584,414753,1,Justie240,18/12/2018,Dogs continually barking day and night and as it’s in a compound in a gorge it just echos continually!! Not a good nights sleep
13584,414735,3,Justie240,17/12/2018,Free area with toilets etc (in summer). Not particularly flat but very central and overlooking the gorge. Hotel where the springs are located is closed down. You can still access the public springs but there’s no where to park the motorhome so you have to walk from this site.
13584,414525,3,nomada76,16/12/2018,"Good place to spend night and day, you can fill water, empty gray and potty raising the sewer (recommended by a neighbor). Look for the black hose that is next to the trash cans and lift trap door to open tap."
13584,407192,4,miguelycatia,13/11/2018,Good place to spend the night.
13584,243116,5,noformal,29/04/2018,"Good parking, very close to the town and hiking trails. It is not an area, it does not have services."
13584,234944,3,Jogalopez,09/04/2018,"The area is without services for that reason only 3 stars, but it is free, very wide, easy access to the entrance of the town, close to the thermal baths, it has some slope so you have to find the most suitable place or put your chocks ... we sleep from Saturday to Sunday and not a problem of noise or bottle, the town is worth it and in the bars the fame of Granada, good tapas and attention"
13584,231005,3,Seren,30/03/2018,We only stopped for a break and water. Nice town though. Services are by the recycling bins in the top left of the bottom car park. Water is via hose accessed by manhole cover (follow black pipe to find it). Plenty of space to park etc
13584,227784,1,HazelB,15/03/2018,The night we stayed here was very noisy with local youths revving cars up and racing motorbikes up and down the road. Local dogs barked nearly all night. Interesting way to get water as well
13584,226135,4,OffRoadKev,06/03/2018,"Good services, great gorge walk, friendly village. Will be back for the hot springs"
13584,223760,4,wagenblog.org,20/02/2018,"City free place. Gray water via disposal channel, toilet over manhole cover, fresh water via PE pipe, tap under cover. Disposal and fresh water gives us the city for free. Thank you!"
13584,218226,1,Blubbs84,08/01/2018,Nice place but the places are all together in a slate location and that makes sleeping impossible. I quickly ran away. Not recommendable.
13584,217971,4,ello,07/01/2018,"Good parking in the middle of town. For motorhomes are provided about 10 seats, which are a bit crooked. Once a week there is a market in the big square. Garbage cans and drain for greywater available."
13584,214091,1,nicolashg,09/12/2017,"Eye, the perfect place, but about 00:00 a little boys on a motorcycle playing the whistle and a few others from above throwing stones at the motorhomes, a complete. the police does not appear"
13584,213311,3,cabulmer,02/12/2017,Photo is confusing. Marked out parking bays are in the lower carpal by the recycling area. It has a drive over waste and a sewage drain under a circular cover with a handle. Fresh water from hose. Rules are on the board. Nice historic town with walks and a small public warm pool.
13584,210541,4,Anakin,10/11/2017,Parking on slope. I think the water intake is a hose bent from the wall. The gray grid and the black one would have to remove a lid. I downloaded in the antequera area. In the square the very expensive Andaluz bar. Not recommended. Guided tour at 12:00 for two hours duration for € 4.
13584,199516,2,anaisma,01/10/2017,"The town is very beautiful and the area is well, there are trails to do (although they were somewhat neglected with spills to the river by some areas of sewage) If you go on a Saturday that you know we have not looked, it was Saturday and there were young people from botellon in the surroundings screaming, also a dog from a nearby house I do not stop barking at the screams and any noise"
13584,150826,3,Amilla,12/07/2017,Located in the fairground. It is a bit remote and alone. Eye to possible botellones :-(
13584,140973,3,dilem,05/06/2017,"Well-located area, tarred ground, slight slope, no water point a priori, nor drainage black water"
13584,134251,4,alba49,10/05/2017,Lovely old town. Great walks and sightseeing. Very friendly. All facilities required including local shops.

13584,119295,3,voyageur18,03/02/2017,Between Malaga and Granada. Parking area at the foot of the village with all services. Even in February seats are taken before noon ...
13584,109076,5,Marginal,07/10/2016,"Very good area. The air is very pure and the people are very nice. The repair service of cars ""Moya"" which is nearby is good and cheap, 18 € per hour. There is a very large fig tree in the parking lot, but a ladder would be useful for picking because the most accessible figs have already been picked. A nearby church announces the hour day and night."

13591,2675611,5,roblaurajames,16/04/2023,"A nice quiet place to stay, with flat pitches. There was a warm shower (1€/5 mins) toilets, ablutions and a washing machine and dryer. I would stay here again. 8€ for the night for all three of us. A bakers car turned up in the morning around 9am selling bread/croissants etc."
13591,2621676,5,parkhymervan,24/03/2023,"Clean, quiet, good and very cheap. Very suitable for a longer stay. The canal is a few meters away. You can easily ride a bike along it. 3 km to Totana."
13591,2603047,5,Lasemeuse,08/03/2023,"Very well done rest area. Clean, neat and the manager of the premises is super welcoming. The places are not large, but to walk around the region, it's great."
13591,2590257,5,rosaliarte,25/02/2023,"Great area, its owner welcomed us despite arriving late and saved a place for us, grateful for it. In the mornings the baker comes by from 9 to 9:30 (except Sundays and holidays) and sells you freshly made bread and some very tasty Neapolitans. Bathroom and sink clean."
13591,2588224,5,frantep,23/02/2023,Very nice and practical place that offers everything for the camper! I can't understand the negative rating at all because of the alleged narrowness and the uselessness of the supply and disposal! Here everything is offered for 8 € what the camper needs and in good quality!
13591,2584059,2,rvanvugt,20/02/2023,"Area is clean, owners are friendly, plots are narrow, waterservice area unusable for me due to its location, not possible to empty my black water tank. Noisy due to barking dogs, a lot of long term visitors spreading themselves around their car. Officially 30 plots, but the owners don't bother to put 36 cars in every little corner or in the centre field. Too much focussed on earning money."
13591,2583697,3,SANDRA2023,19/02/2023,Very quiet place and ideal for a stopover if you are traveling

13591,2571983,5,cgim,08/02/2023,"Very sweet owners. Help where possible. Everything is there for the convenience of the camper. The baker comes by in the morning. From here you can walk, cycle, mountain bike, or just relax. Lorca is 20 km by bike along the canal. Based with its crater lake is more than worth it. Restaurant La Rata, here you can enjoy good food,….."

13591,2506748,4,balderj,27/11/2022,"excellent camper location, have arrived here several times, what we like anyway is the graduated system in terms of service, you pay extra for electricity and the shower, you do not need it, you do not pay for it. what I do regret is that there are campers who find it necessary to dump a full bag of empty wine bottles here while there are municipal containers nearby."
13591,2498085,4,Beasty442,17/11/2022,"This is our second visit to this site. We weren't disappointed and stayed for 3 nights. Enjoyed some walks, cycling and played petanca. The wind the one night was rocking the motorhome."

13591,1755130,2,caro02,13/02/2022,"Just looking for a place to stay. But again everything full of permanent campers. Also, the motorhome should not be too big."

13591,1748257,2,dupi24,05/02/2022,"On top of each other, not a smile from the owners when you arrive."
13591,1740736,1,rvanvugt,24/01/2022,"Crowded tight spaces, no privacy at all, not my cup of tea. Tidy and well maintained yes, but the lack of privacy made me leave immediately. A pity, as you get the impression that it's all about making most money with less area offered. I decided to stay at the neighbors, which offers very big and wide spaces at the same price in a completely fenced area, with nicer views and a lot more privacy."
13591,1737355,1,Carthatobi,20/01/2022,"Completely crowded, maximum 2 meters distance between seats. Anyone who doesn't need privacy is certainly in good hands here. Next door is a new pitch with huge plots, a good alternative for those who find it too small."

13591,1732114,3,copemo,11/01/2022,"Actually a great place if each place had a little more width, therefore more a better parking lot and every corner is currently being used for parking. Super nice owner or administrator, well maintained and clean, everything you need is available. Addition, I'm sorry, but this beautiful place is declared a parking lot by more and more latecomers and people standing across from it."

13591,767168,4,tvradio42,11/01/2020,This site now has a smart new toilet. Views are good and WiFi one of the best. Basic but very friendly stayed four weeks. You need an electric bike to appreciate the area. Four star as supermarkets bottom of very steep hill.

13591,233392,5,Muddyfeet,04/04/2018,"Lovely aire with a real friendly & welcoming atmosphere. The owners have excellent English & were most helpful with local information etc.  Fairly level ground, two tiers, at 36 ft, we were too big to go up on the top level but there was room to accommodate us on the lower level. Pitches are on the snug side but for €7 a night, you get what you pay for. One clean spacious shower with plenty of hot water (€1 for 5 mins) washing machine & tumble drier @ €3 each and washing lines too. The machine was busy all day, everyday but people just took their turns.  Gorgeous views across the valley and great cycling.  It’s about 6km into town and quite a gruelling cycle home as nearly all uphill but no bother for those with electric bikes."
13591,225900,5,diglois,05/03/2018,"Very popular aire, helpful owners and assistants. Good WiFi, electric needs long leads unless you're next to it. Walks and cycling nearby, town about 3km away. Washing machine and drying area."

Good for walking and cycling, the town is a fair walk away although there are restaurants in walking distance. Petrol station 15mins walk has a shop."
13591,204198,3,pepacamper,19/10/2017,"All very well, except for the payment training. They have a sign that says if you are not there you can leave the money in a mailbox. At the Fiat next before leaving and since we did not know if we were going to stay more nights we left € 10. We returned in the afternoon and left another € 10 more. At night a woman walked by and told us that if we paid her, we told her that we had left it in the mailbox and said ok. In the morning before leaving a man came telling us if we stayed longer and if we paid him, we told him that we had already done it and he asked us when, etc. Anyway, even if you leave the money in the diver and, better wait because they charge and you leave with the bad taste of the mouth knowing that you have paid and are suspicious;)"

The manager came to tell us that the area was only open from November 1st to May 31st. He allowed us to stay overnight and opened the water, electricity and wifi for us. Area to recommend!"
13591,15745,5,ddbzh44,27/05/2014,Very nice area slightly in altitude with magnificent views. In the heart of the mountain range of Espugna which can be visited on foot or by bike from the site. Home nice and cool! 7 € with Wi-Fi. Well located between Lorca and Murcia.

13618,3008513,4,Yame17,23/07/2023,"Quiet campsite. Minimum 3 nights. The best is its pools, they are fantastic. large plots. updated showers. Everything very clean. One thing I found strange is that there is no toilet paper in the bathrooms, I have never seen that before. The store/supermarket is only open on Fridays and Saturdays. Price for 2 people + plot + electricity = €42.40. Pets are not allowed."
13618,2888341,5,Nellekees,24/06/2023,"friendly and helpful reception, hot water at any time of the day, swimming pool was wonderfully salty and very clean water, places more than enough. we were very satisfied"

13618,2445185,4,ivopolli,15/10/2022,A great place. The pool is amazing and is refilled with thermal water every day. Pitches and wash houses really great. Only the price (without ACSI) and the friendliness should be worked on. Otherwise definitely 5/5 stars.
13618,2429177,2,hamicado,07/10/2022,We were quite rudely pointed out that at least 3 days must be booked. You could have said that nicely.

13618,1710814,2,LisanMark,16/12/2021,We were parked nearby so went to view on our bicycles. Wanted information regarding longer term stay. Spoke to reception and based on their treatment of us I left and said to my husband that we'll never ever stay there for any reason.
13618,1708621,3,hoang,12/12/2021,Price are high 33 euro for cc and 2 kids incl electricity . You need to pay for kids from 2 and up. Only wifi in in the pool / reception. Paid WiFi on the campsite. Good swimming salt pool around 30 degrees. A lot of people that are staying there for the winter.
13618,1619465,1,AM55,01/10/2021,Place was NOT allowed to be visited for / before booking (had come from Mazarron by bike). An absurdity - I've never seen anything like this in Spain in the last few weeks! Unfriendly gentleman at the barrier / reception.

13618,474471,4,dudululu,03/05/2019,"Very large campsite but warm welcome (in French). The locations are correct, the bathrooms are clean. There is WiFi and two saltwater pools. Very calm. We paid 26 € for one night, with van and two people, no extra."
13618,344868,4,sici72,20/08/2018,"Camping very clean, it's very very relaxing, perfect French home, to advise to be quiet, there is no animation"
13618,338632,1,Luisfran,17/08/2018,"The emptying is a lie, it is outside the campsite, and they do not let you fill or empty or pay. Pretty unfriendly and unpleasant."
13618,253454,5,TininMurcia,14/05/2018,Excellent camping Very quiet and well parceled. Spectacular salt water pool at 30 degrees. Very calm. Almost everything is motor homes.
13618,224413,1,Mumu09,24/02/2018,"Very bad reception. Do not accept even miniature dogs. Like all the campsites in the area, complete in February. In general, Spaniards do not like animals. So they do not like, therefore, humans. Spain does not deserve to stay here"
13618,62840,1,pat17460,22/01/2016,"While the emptying station is outside the campsite, even when paying they refuse you access. It's their right but not very nice given the lack of resort in the region."
13620,3237661,4,Bine2299,30/08/2023,"We were prepared by the comments and closed everything from half past seven and didn't have any mosquito problems. It's just no place to sit outside. But a group of campers did just that until night and chatted incessantly and very loudly. In comparison, the only three shots at birds in the late evening were nothing. It's a shame, how can you be so inconsiderate. V/E probably only on request, is locked."
13620,3235469,5,Covelar,29/08/2023,"Spectacular area in the middle of the Delta. Next to Casa Fusta, which is a restaurant that eats great. Staying overnight is free, and services cost 5 euros. Full of mosquitoes but very pretty"
13620,3219221,5,Evoeh,26/08/2023,"The place is very good. The Delta has mosquitoes, it is one of the characteristics of the ecosystem. Obviously, if what you want is to set up your table at 10 pm, forget about it, you are among rice paddies. Stay inside, put incense, anti-mosquitoes and kill the one that has been able to enter and do not replenish water at those most critical hours in summer. For the rest, there are roosters that start crowing at 5 in the morning"
13620,3207526,2,patri20,23/08/2023,"The super nice place but it is full of mosquitoes, we have been outside for a few minutes and we are full of bites. We're leaving because you can't be with so much mosquito"
13620,3153192,5,wagner68,15/08/2023,"very nice in the middle of the delta and rice fields. lots of places, a restaurant and various possible activities. a drain terminals available (paying, 5 euros)"
13620,3133905,5,MarioFamilyVan,13/08/2023,"perfect for those passing through. Nearby they are all closed for village festivals, even Amposta is closed, this stop allowed us to spend a quiet night."
13620,3102238,4,AndreaFquattro,08/08/2023,"Fairly large car park with many spaces. Bring mosquito repellent because clearly there are many, they say that in September during the rice harvest the quantity still increases. It is easy to find without GPS, you just need to follow the indication of the restaurant ""La Casa De Fusta"" that are all over the Delta. It seems quite airy and there are no lights at night. We have not tested the service"
13620,3086701,3,DavidMolina,06/08/2023,"It is surrounded by rice fields, hence the explanation for so many mosquitoes, but being free, it is luxurious."
13620,3042627,1,jak123parl,29/07/2023,"The place itself is actually ok, but the comments about the mosquitoes are actually true. You can't get out of the van properly. Were there for a minute and each had 5 mosquito bites"
13620,3040731,4,Zlnzln,29/07/2023,"Quiet near the pond. Super clean, uncrowded. Could it be because of the terrible mosquitoes that rage with rare savagery at sunset and dawn? If it weren't for his damn critters it would be perfect!"
13620,2994986,4,park4nightR7,21/07/2023,"Good place to spend the night for free, paid services (5 euros), very spacious and quiet place in a spectacular area, the only problem is the plague of mosquitoes, you literally can't get out of the van, for the rest, an absolutely recommendable place."
13620,2984476,5,Juanmillas,18/07/2023,"I have not been to this site, but several times in the delta in other places. I leave this comment only because of the innumerable criticisms about mosquitoes, let's see..., you are in a lagoon, an unavoidable area of mosquitoes, the problem is not the parking. If you don't assume that, DO NOT go to the delta…., in a week I will go to this parking lot because I have noticed the logical opinions."
13620,2906296,1,staffie88100,29/06/2023,"At 10 seconds at least 50 mosquitoes in the motorhome, our dog was bitten at least 100 times on the body, I do not recommend this car park"
13620,2852435,4,MiaPaula,14/06/2023,"Convenient because it is free, plenty of space and located at the access to several walk departure points."
13620,2848240,1,rokicampers,12/06/2023,"Impossible to be There is a plague of mosquitoes and in a minute you are full of bites. In addition, the space needs to be conditioned both due to garbage and neglect. Shots are heard all night to scare the birds away from entering the rice fields. For what you can't sleep… there are much better places"
13620,2837220,4,patriciasab,09/06/2023,"Large parking lot for all sizes of CCARS. No services. Lots of mosquitoes! The essential oils of Geranium, eucalyptus, lemongrass repel them a little! The museum is interesting."
13620,2825608,2,fpuertoes,06/06/2023,"The place is beautiful, next to the rice fields you will see many different birds passing by and the sunset is very nice. Too bad about the noise at night with the systems to scare away birds but above all the mosquitoes, it's a plague. Waking up, we left without even having breakfast as we were literally eaten by them. It has no services."
13620,2809210,5,Davidarretxe,01/06/2023,Very nice and quiet. At dawn there are clouds of large mosquitoes! Perfect for not moving the van and exploring the area on foot or by bike enjoying the birds.
13620,2808522,5,Pablosub,01/06/2023,"Quiet place to spend the night, free. water services are 5e. The Casa de Fusta restaurant makes very good local food. The rice very rich. Bike routes that leave from there. We saw flamingos! essential protection for mosquitoes (you are in the lagoon)."
13620,2796592,4,albertkek,28/05/2023,I have been here many times and there has never been a problem. Very well located and spacious. The only con is that at night shots are heard that serve to scare away the birds. Very good and recommended area.
13620,2781574,5,silvii6,24/05/2023,"We slept very well here for two nights. Yes, the guns can be heard, but that didn't bother us. There was a lot going on, but there were still a lot of places left!"
13620,2778029,1,QQ1212,23/05/2023,"If you are looking for a sleepless night, this is the place for you. The firing systems to drive the ducks off the fields are very loud, frequent and last all night."
13620,2776878,5,FamilyVanplanet,22/05/2023,"Quiet area with level squares, services have a cost of €5 (emptying and filling with water). Perfect to sleep a couple of nights and get to know the area."
13620,2770850,5,galen0,21/05/2023,"Yes, quiet guy, level and with services (download €5). Restaurant and place to rent bikes, etc."
13620,2769300,1,pasquib,20/05/2023,Mosquitoes will eat you
13620,2752857,4,lenny1996,15/05/2023,"Nice place, there's a lot going on here in May. Shots can be heard in the evening and at night, probably duck hunting. Sewage and water costs 5€."
13620,2742501,4,FrancescaBigarelli,11/05/2023,"Quiet parking area, normal"
13620,2741147,5,thilotravels,11/05/2023,Free parking. Surprised at first because everything is numbered. But you can just stand up. Playground right next door and restaurant highly recommended.
13620,2728766,4,Elst75,06/05/2023,"FREE parking mostly for motorhomes, few campers. The floor is made of stones (gravel). Located next to the restaurant ""Casa Fusta"" and a viewpoint where you can calmly observe the basins of L'escayinsada, the largest in the nature reserve. There are sinks but no shower, nor to wash dishes. A small beach bar where you can buy drinks and ice cream. From the Camper you do not have views of the rice fields."
13620,2726508,5,IrisRupp,05/05/2023,Supply possibility can be used all day. Place very clean. Fish platter in the restaurant very tasty.
13620,2716093,4,marievague,02/05/2023,"Always a very nice place, place a bit small. emptying and clean water services at €5. On this weekend of May 1, 2023, full parking lot so a lot of noise during the day. Very calm night."
13620,2715629,5,indigovan,02/05/2023,"Given the few opportunities to stand in the nature reserve, this place is ideal for a stay in this area. There is enough space and there is no barrier, so you can arrive late. #indigo_van"
13620,2713883,4,nuketown,01/05/2023,"Perfect place to park, sleep but it's a pity that the parking spaces are not controlled, if we would be less comfortable or selfish we would enter more. The organization was a bit of a disaster since in the morning they did not have the possibility of filling water or cleaning potti due to lack of water Despite this, they wanted to collect the 5e. In these cases, a better control paid by us would be ideal"
13620,2710210,3,PsychoPat,30/04/2023,indeed a magnificent region on the delta but where it is not always easy to meet and when you reach the end you are told that it is full... I found it very tiring... you just have to find a another place and time passes
13620,2706463,3,Ernes98,29/04/2023,"Since it is not paid and there is little control, unfortunately it is a DJ, there are those who occupy more than one place, others who leave the table and go to spend the day there... If things are crowded and Instead of 30, 40 can enter, a little please. The place itself is in a very beautiful setting, in the center of everything that can be visited by bicycle. Cool restaurant! paella a 10."
13620,2705063,5,saggiunddani,29/04/2023,"Super free quiet place. However, from 9 p.m. all seats were taken (28.04.). Disposal or fresh water 5€"
13620,2704467,5,izasisa,28/04/2023,Good place at least in low season. From what it seems it is allowed to remove tables and awning. A good starting point for a couple of bike rides (around the lagoon and out to the trabucador beach).
13620,2702376,5,donnaA,28/04/2023,Parked here for 2 nights in small camper-van with my 2 daughters. Felt very safe. Toilets available during the day close about 7pm. Staff in restaurant and cafe very friendly. Lots of camper vans and motor homes.
13620,2695626,5,Saskia0812,25/04/2023,"Nicely located pitch to cycle to the beach and see flamingos. Rocky ground. You can easily park here with large mobile homes. V/E available for an extra charge, we didn't use it. Were one night on 27.3. there."

13620,2689310,4,JosepPujol,22/04/2023,"We were in the middle of the delta and very calmly, the only bad thing, that even with the mosquito net, mosquitoes slip through."

13620,2670668,5,smayli,14/04/2023,Was very nice again had two nice nights and two wonderful kite days.
13620,2668371,5,KILIANBERGA,13/04/2023,"From cinema In the summer it must be more difficult to find a place, but in the off-season it was easy (arriving in the middle of the morning). Quiet place, with restaurant to buy bread or have a meal. Starting point for cycling and walking routes. Ideal for children. Thanks!!!!!!"
13620,2666815,5,mariaviver,13/04/2023,Very good! We arrived late and there was somewhere left. Very kind. We bought fresh bread and rented a bike for the 4 of us (including the little ones) to go along a type of greenway that borders a canal. We saw many birds. All great.
13620,2665531,4,ochautemps74,12/04/2023,"Large car park with free parking, service 5 € so very correct, very quiet at night, a little too many motorhomes for my taste, but very practical."
13620,2664553,4,BennyMartin,12/04/2023,I couldn't test the parking lot (which doesn't look bad at all) but just an emptying and a full of water. Perfect for a stopover. However…. A lot of free riders already stationed asking you to be able to empty their slush funds when you have just paid… strange state of mind…
13620,2656386,4,chantaldante,10/04/2023,Beautiful free area in a quiet area and beautiful walks to do. Bad road to get there. Restaurant next door. 5€ for services. Lots of people and full in the evening. We spent a quiet night and were woken up by doves.
13620,2655970,5,familyM.CH,09/04/2023,"It is important to arrive early or just after lunch, as everything gets busy in the afternoon. It's great with girls, you have a small park next to it, the restaurant snack bar, and very easy routes to cycle. Very quiet place and highly recommended for visiting the Delta"
13620,2655667,5,sophie.et.juju,09/04/2023,"2 nights spent in late March. Very nice and well-kept place and for free! Thanks to the operators. Only for waste disposal and water would be 5 euros to pay. Perfect starting point for cycling tours in the Ebro Delta. Fresh baguette in the morning in the restaurant. We'll be back, thank you."
13620,2653902,4,DR1969,09/04/2023,Public and orderly area. Perfect place for bird watching
13620,2652237,4,kolokasa,09/04/2023,You must arrive early because it fills up immediately. Good area with wide and flat delimited plot. Excellent for both walking and cycling routes.
13620,2650427,5,indiana65,08/04/2023,perfect and thank the owner for so much kindness pity the incivics that there are everywhere .... removing chairs and tables and occupying more space than they should ... especially foreigners who believe they have the right to everything
13620,2648768,5,cdo123,08/04/2023,"We had a great night! Very quiet and very nice environment! You can rent bikes in the wooden house! Try to get there early, especially in high season!"
13620,2647781,5,JoanBcn,07/04/2023,Good place to spend the day and night. Good attention/information from the staff. €5 service for gray water and clean water.
13620,2646839,4,xabatiko,07/04/2023,Free area with large delimited and level plots. It fills up easily and it's hard to find a seat in the afternoon. good cycling and walking routes to see birds in the restaurant area next door with good service.
13620,2646676,5,morris8a,07/04/2023,"The truth is that the site is luxurious, and completely free. With bar and restaurant, bike rental or open toilet next door if needed. I totally recommend as the environment is spectacular."
13620,2644139,4,MADOCA,06/04/2023,Beautiful natural and relaxing place.
13620,2641280,5,joanmagrans,05/04/2023,"Very nice surroundings, wide squares, next to the restaurant and ideal for bicycle tours."
13620,2639308,5,FamiliaGil,04/04/2023,The pitches are very level and easy to enter. The services are very comfortable and for €5 you can fill and empty gray and black. Parking is free. very well located to be able to make routes by bike and walking. A success in spending 2 nights. we will be back
13620,2637883,5,LorAi,03/04/2023,"Thank you very much for this area. Wide and level parcels, in the afternoon it fills up very quickly. Free sleep and €5 services. Beach bar next door, they rent bikes for rides. Restaurant next door that does takeaway. We will be back. Thanks again."
13620,2637245,3,gerrypfn,03/04/2023,"Fabulous location and great stopover. You can eat, hire bikes or walk and birdwatch. Only issue we had was someone stealing our water carrier temporarily stowed between the bikes and the van. T"
13620,2636764,3,heimmarkus,03/04/2023,"easy approach, but very very crowded very early. Water and waste disposal together cost 5 euros! Numbered parking spaces, even the smallest gaps are parked. Arrivals until about 10:30 p.m. OK for an overnight stay in transit. in the morning the police drive control"
13620,2635810,4,Reuben_Joe,02/04/2023,"Great place overall, but understandably crowded at times. I wish there were more places like this one. Not many other options around this area"
13620,2635695,4,ElisaElius,02/04/2023,"Good area We went these dates and they don't pay. You can rent bikes and take a tour up to the fence. Recommended 100x100. We also had lunch in the wooden house and we loved it, the restaurant next door. Toilets available from 9 am"
13620,2635289,4,alien62,02/04/2023,"the place is well organized, you pay for emptying closed with a chain. a nice restaurant, bathrooms, and bird watching station in the lagoon. Unfortunately, the road for 7 km is narrow in the middle of the fields, difficult to exchange with cars, I imagine with campers."
13620,2633754,5,PepeReisant,01/04/2023,Great place to rest with beautiful views surrounded by nature.
13620,2633522,5,Wildthings,01/04/2023,"Great spot adjacent walking and cycling trails. Gravel standings with recycling bins. You have to pay for any services by asking someone in the adjacent centre who unlocks the tap and access to black and grey waste (€5 we think). 60 pitches so would be tight in high-season. 
Either go prepared not toha e services or pay €5 which is probably only working hours daily; not certain. 
Would use again."
13620,2629548,5,albatros21,29/03/2023,"Quiet, clean, and at the start of cycle paths. Flamingos, lagoons, long beaches. Stunning. Restaurant Casa de Futa to advise, delicious and friendly service."
13620,2626623,5,Annadinamita,27/03/2023,"we arrived at noon. Good food in restaurant. We rented bikes and had a good ride. We observe different birds and especially beautiful flamingos. We also spend the night. And I think that in such an idyllic place, 5 euros for services is not much. I would go back even if I paid more."
13620,2624095,5,Blanchedu84,25/03/2023,"A great quiet stopover, it's like being in the Camargue in the middle of rice fields and birds! Too bad for the restaurant that we could not test because closed on Sunday."
13620,2621904,3,IBakkenI,24/03/2023,"Quite a decent place with what looked to me like wild birds trapped in a cage next to the restaurant. I see it as ridiculous that they charge for emptying grey/black water and filling, when you only need to drive 10-12 minutes and you get everything done for free. There is also a small lookout tower just across the road.."
13620,2618910,5,crisjuank,21/03/2023,"On the way we thought it would be a seedy parking lot and far from God's hand, we were pleasantly surprised. A super careful parking lot, with a very cool restaurant, we ate wonderfully (the paella a 10!) It also has bird cages, some of which are curious. Beautiful landscape where you can start excursions. I counted 60 cars and campers. The services are paid, but really, to be free, a 10!"
13620,2614483,5,amcantalojas,18/03/2023,"We arrived late and the RV park was full, we asked at the restaurant and a very friendly waiter came out to check if there was any space left. Since there was no one, he let us spend the night in the parking lot next to the passenger cars. When it was free we went to dinner at the bar as a thank you."
13620,2607949,3,thoka26,13/03/2023,"Although free of charge but VE for 5, - € even if you only want to borrow the urine canister of the separation toilet, I think it's impudent. There are toilets, but emptying the canister is forbidden."
13620,2606152,5,Catalinalafalce,11/03/2023,"A paradise this place. Very calm, well organized and good atmosphere."
13620,2603255,4,rodette,08/03/2023,We were there on 25.2.2023. Parking was free. We took the opportunity for a short walk at sunset and then went to enjoy some tapas at the restaurant! Good place !
13620,2589878,4,Laure30133,25/02/2023,"Clean and quiet place. Free parking. On the other hand, the water and the emptying were only available from 10 a.m. the next day because someone from the restaurant must be available. If you don't have sanitary facilities, it's difficult to find wild places. Not suitable for a van."
13620,2588829,5,Freenam,24/02/2023,"Sunny, straight and sufficiently large pitches. Restaurant next door. Great starting point for cycling tours. Everything as described by predecessors."
13620,2584866,5,Fredetdo,20/02/2023,"Very good place to park. At the moment it's free, only gray and black emptying services and full of water are charged 5€. I confirm, the restaurant serves good food with (among other things) excellent regional dishes. And of course many walks around, on foot or better by bike. Right now a lot of pink flamingos!"
13620,2582561,5,Zaidatb,19/02/2023,"Great area to enjoy the Delta! The area is owned by the restaurant next door, which by the way has very good food. Ideal area to go rogue as bikes are rented there, there are animals, children's park, etc. Good place to spend the night!"
13620,2576544,5,Duoz,13/02/2023,"Very nice , spacious camper park quiet good location. Restaurant nearby is worth going and not expensive. Friendy familiy restaurants who are proud to tell the history off the Delta. Recommendable."
13620,2569617,5,uriplans,05/02/2023,"Very well located area for cycling trips along the Delta. Many well-marked and free spaces, water services are paid only €5. In the same place you will find many activities to do if you are naughty, from a children's park, renting bikes, kayaks, fishing boats. Definitely visit the Restaurant, the food is delicious."
13620,2564240,5,05091959,30/01/2023,great free place in this season paying service 5€. Start of a great walk in the middle of the reserve with extraordinary wildlife. We spent 5 quiet nights.

No wifi in the parking area !"

13620,2553377,2,Leila1879,16/01/2023,"we have a 6m van and not much space to sit by your van when the car park is busy. you have to wait for the man to get fresh water and emptying toilet and he usually turns up about 10am. people use both taps for fresh water and cleaning the toilet as there are no signs, very disgusting. 
BUT it is in a beautiful location with amazing sunsets and sunrises with great access to cycle the lagoons."
13620,2551852,5,Abril20,14/01/2023,Large area of land with delimited plots. Next to the wooden house restaurant and the reed pool. 10 minutes from Poblenou del Delta. The restaurant told us that at the moment the area is FREE AND SERVICES €5 (without electricity). Good restaurant.

13620,2527261,5,sandrido,24/12/2022,"Super place, quiet next to the Casa de Fusta restaurant where you eat very well. In this period, parking is free and you pay €5 only for loading/unloading. No electricity. At night you sleep well and only hear the noise of the birds. With the bicycle it is possible to make beautiful routes in nature and admire the flamingos. Do not miss the sunset over the lagoon."
13620,2514500,5,illoundmops,06/12/2022,"It's great and we were very safe. In addition, it was very quiet. There are several opportunities for walking or cycling here. We borrowed a bike for two (Surrey Bike) and explored the area. There is also a restaurant, a small playground and you can watch chickens. You can buy drinks at the bike rental and there is plenty of seating."
13620,2504689,4,Bavariai690,24/11/2022,Quiet place despite a little background noise... but not disturbing. Perfect place to rest body and soul. Walks or bike rides. Natural park and hundreds of birds. Several points of view to admire or photograph. We recommend.
13620,2495625,3,EricBruvel,14/11/2022,"This November 14, no one to cash the stay... The shed remained closed. So free. As the restaurant is closed, there is no tap water. otherwise dump OK. Very calm place. No security concerns."
13620,2486249,4,xebri,07/11/2022,"We were on October 14 and quite well. We only had to pay €5 for water, the parking did not charge us. The ground is fairly level. The only problem was the hunters the next day, at 7:30 they were already shooting. The rest normal, nothing infestation of ants as other people commented. Of course, mosquitoes always keep you company, but it's the delta... what are you waiting for? :)"
13620,2481553,5,francoisegoyard,04/11/2022,very nice place. no water in winter. restaurant closed. walk through the lagoon. calm apart from the sounds of the farm in the distance.

Fee for fresh water is 5 € (no information sign available). Toilets ONLY open during the day. Parking and use of the toilets are free. A lot of mosquitoes because of the swampy area."

Do not get too close to the trees because they are full of ants and they enter easily, in the restaurant you eat very well! Our menu will be able to taste 6 first to share a rice and the 3 typical desserts all delicious. the trabucador beach, the fangar lighthouse, els ullals de Baltasar and buy fish at the Amposta municipal market"
13620,2446026,4,chiaracibe,16/10/2022,"Great spot to see the sunset and flamingos early in the morning, beautiful view. Stop with gray and black water drain, there is no electricity and there were fountains but the water was closing. Beware of midges, here it is essential you have an insecticide! We stayed one night and the next day we went to the nearby beach."
13620,2445967,3,RaquelMurillo,16/10/2022,"quiet place at night, lots of ants and they got into the ac. It so happened that it was hunting day and at 7:30 they started shooting, it's only once a month."
13620,2432965,5,Nadine.Weber,09/10/2022,"Great ! quiet, bike rides on tracks and roads but cool in this season... the mosquitoes attack at the end of the day!! 9€/night with water refill otherwise free. You can recharge the batteries of the VAE... 5€/bike...you have to ask the gentleman in the small wooden shed on the left at the entrance to the area (very nice)."
13620,2362670,1,Viajamos4,11/09/2022,watch out! the site is fine but during the night millions of ants entered the motorhome. We have spent hours removing ants and we were not the only ones.
13620,2320101,4,MiguelMinondo,30/08/2022,"Very quiet place, next to a restaurant where they serve good lunches until 11 am. At night the place is deserted, barely six BC on a weekend in August. Good place for bike routes and bird watching. More areas like this spread throughout the Delta were needed, especially near the beaches and towns"
13620,2318857,3,CarmenCamp,29/08/2022,"I was expecting more from the reviews I had read, but I was disappointed. It is a gravel parking lot, no shade, no electricity, and aside from mosquitoes, there was an infestation of ants that have crawled through every hole in the ac. The information on the activities of the park of the whip house was scarce, it may not be the best place to visit it."
13620,2275476,5,anansoain,20/08/2022,"you can book on the website of the most of la cuixota and yesterday there were almost no mosquitoes we were very few in the area at 8 o'clock they close bathrooms and drain emptying area.... very well located next to a viewpoint, you can make routes by bike....and you sleep with the croaking of frogs...wake up with the sound of ducks..."
13620,2268535,1,ToniTolra,19/08/2022,"The entrance hours are from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. After a 6 hour trip (600 km) we arrived at 01:00. and we found it closed. It is unheard of that a motorhome zone that, in addition, is paid, has entry times. We went to spend the night in the area of Sant Carles de la Rápita, which, although not as pretty, has a water filling and discharge service."
13620,2246727,5,JOJUSA,16/08/2022,Good stop for the night near the trabucador. Mosquitoes are a problem but of course it is an environment full of water because of the rice. The restaurant makes very good paellas.
13620,2239013,4,CMD4X4,14/08/2022,"Parking super well located with restaurant. For putting a hit? the toilets close at night, but for 5 euros (in our case with a 4x4 roof tent) it is more than enough. WARNING! stock up on a good mosquito repellant!!"
13620,2233035,1,aroafont,14/08/2022,"The area is fine, but impossible to be with so many mosquitoes, there are too many! I would not repeat!!"
13620,2155098,3,Hodlok,01/08/2022,"Very quiet area with many activities nearby. The restaurant is very good. The area as such is quite nice but a bit expensive for what it offers. If it had electricity, the price would be justified."
13620,2140264,5,DronyMochila,29/07/2022,There are places for campers at €5 with services included. I have spent two very quiet days making paths. Very helpful staff
13620,2008057,2,Pumaflo1997,25/06/2022,"Actually a very nice place, but there are so many mosquitoes here that you don't want to be outside at all. We went in early and got rid of all the mosquitoes first. Will continue straight away tomorrow."
13620,1954267,4,aiguader,06/06/2022,"All very well (location, space, services, essential restaurant). However, there is a decline in the professionalism / training of the waiters and the people who in a few hours lead the reception of the area."
13620,1930390,2,mecano84,30/05/2022,a beautiful place but the staff is not friendly and in addition at night there is a lot of noise with automatic fire damage
13620,1904773,2,AVIVA50,21/05/2022,The site is fine... But... The mosquitoes are enormous and in industrial quantities! very very unpleasant !
13620,1902588,5,berlisendaxtr,20/05/2022,"We spent the night on 5/18, you can make a reservation online, large spaces, for a vw California they charged us €5, gray/black drinking water, next door you can rent bikes and do routes. I recommend it."
13620,1900185,3,Jeromeverite17,19/05/2022,"Ideal for going for bike rides, quiet place, 9€ with services. 12 km from Rapita cycle path."
13620,1892672,2,Aloys52686,15/05/2022,"The places depend on the length of the camper. Up to 6 'm it's €5, but they screw up and charge everyone €9. Don't give in. scammers"
13620,1882132,5,SamuelGG,10/05/2022,"Good area, in low season you can enter and leave without problem in high season Check in from 09:00 and check out at 10:30. Good area to visit the Encanyissada and the Tancada."
13620,1840313,4,baloo75,20/04/2022,"great area. To the previous comments add that they also sell butane, propane and liquid for the potty, which is good for an emergency. We rented a bike-car and it was a lot of fun"
13620,1835276,4,mariemichel,18/04/2022,Attention: Water taps only Open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
13620,1832644,4,evamsa,17/04/2022,"It is a great area, it would only lack the power to connect to electricity. I don't understand the water filling schedule either"
13620,1818757,3,MarkAm,13/04/2022,"Correct area all services included except electricity. Ample places, you have to book and pay online. Good located, passes the road to make bike trips to the delta. There is a restaurant next door."
13620,1818147,3,JonathanSanme,13/04/2022,"The Area is very good and with services included, except electricity. Has picnic tables, restrooms. The staff leaves a lot to be desired, as does the restaurant staff. (Especially the older staff) The food is good and I recommend it 100% and the same as the area and its surroundings. If you go to the restaurant patience to be served."
13620,1813632,4,marpaufel,10/04/2022,"You reserve a place in advance and when you arrive it is occupied. He says it well here, you have to book before and not arrive and position yourself where you want. They must have better control, we are talking about €9 per night, without electricity. The best is the restaurant and its staff. Exquisite paella at a very good price."
13620,1804316,1,Chausson22019,02/04/2022,The 2 toilets are locked from 6 p.m
13620,1801338,4,Sabwag58,30/03/2022,"Nice place, a bit bumpy approach. Supply and disposal is possible 24 hours. The toilet was ok when we were there. But there are only 2, and there are whole buses with students, so it's definitely difficult. The restaurant is open Fri/Sat/Sun until 10 p.m. (30.3.22), otherwise only until 6 p.m., it's just not worth it out of season. staff very friendly. Besides us, there were 5 other campers here. price ok"
13620,1799766,1,M3urice,29/03/2022,Very disappointed after previous visits. Paid the €9 and put ticket in windscreen so could be read from outside after being told was 'muy importante' to do so. That did not stop some uncaring person banging on my van waking us and demanding to see the ticket. I told him where it was and he just left. No apology. Old dirty toilet outside and the meal in the restaurant was poor . We won't be back.
13620,1794973,5,Frankia84400,25/03/2022,Always so nice apart from the weather.
13620,1790870,3,Ricardsc,21/03/2022,"Area that could well deserve 5 stars if it were not for having some squares very close to each other, it is very common in our country and something that users hate, we do not mind paying more for it, by the way that it does not have power It is NOT a problem for most ACs with solar panels, leaving before 10 a.m. and restricted filling and emptying hours seems to me to be a serious mistake."
13620,1790296,4,625bailey,21/03/2022,"Spent a lovely quiet evening/night at aire. You pay at bar hut €9 card or cash. You can pay online as well. All services available except electric. Surrounded by nature reserve, great for bird watching."
13620,1785923,1,M3urice,17/03/2022,"Paid 9 euros; very disappointed with the restaurant after our former visit; old toilets and after learning that it was ""muy important"" to display the ticket in the windshield, one of the staff knocked vigorously on my door demanding that this one was visible in front of my steering wheel ... and no apologies nor for waking us up after a long drive. No water either. We are not going back there."
13620,1783038,4,EmyBikeWorldPiera,14/03/2022,Payment area 9e well located with services but without electricity. Restaurant next door and several paths for cycling or walking.
13620,1776699,4,Irie,07/03/2022,good place in the middle of a nature park. 2 years ago when it was free of charge is was very crowded. Now people seem to prefer the new free place  in  Sant Jaume d'Elveja near a busy road. If you like silence and nature this is a very nice area. Friendly staff. They take reservations.
13620,1771485,4,PhoenixCologne,02/03/2022,Friendly staff. Very nice location on the edge of the national park. Ideal for bike rides to the sea or the Ebro. Places are parceled out and quite small.
13620,1770483,3,Jane23,01/03/2022,"Spent a few quiet nights here. The service station (fresh water) is only accessible at limited times. The toilets are really dirty, not only when other visitors come here at the weekend. We didn't use them. You can eat well in the adjoining restaurant, paella and seafood. We explored the delta by bike, impressive bird life."
13620,1764781,4,copemo,24/02/2022,"Quiet, well-kept place with supply / disposal without electricity and acceptable 9 euros - unfortunately also in the area with a lot of delta tourism. The public toilets are absolutely unacceptable, especially when there are 100-300 extra visitors for the museum and amusement park."
13620,1759399,2,casetarodes,18/02/2022,"I do NOT understand how we get to 4 in the afternoon and until tomorrow we can not clean the cassette or fill water because it is cut, if we come is to stay and use the services, but tomorrow at 12 we have to be out if we want to pay one more night ... gentlemen, better service! I don't understand how we got to 4 in the afternoon and until tomorrow we can't clean the cassette or fill it with water."

We have been 26 /01 and with many places. The restaurant is 10 I recommend 100% good price and quality and very good service. To reserve we called the phone and this morning we paid. thank you for leaving us a few more hours, many thanks"

Gerard and rosa maría Challengers 260, our Gea"
13620,1729146,3,Travelfamilycat,07/01/2022,"A good place. Quiet, spacious and with services. Start of bike and walking routes. Restaurant and Bar in the same space. I do not give more note for 2 reasons: Draining schedule and filling from 9 to 18, and no electricity option."
13620,1722475,5,MaribelVives,01/01/2022,A spectacular place. Good services. Many activities to do in this paradise such as the Delta de l'Ebre. Spacious places and very good attention from Mr. Àngel
13620,1722243,5,Michael21,01/01/2022,"Nice clean place and quiet nature reserve, nice groundskeeper, reasonable prices"
13620,1718318,4,Didiruca06,29/12/2021,"Now pay, € 9, but it is worth places like that. whenever we come we never have problems, and a good paella always falls. It is true that they cut the water, but in the morning they open it again. Nice bike ride to the blunderbuss."
13620,1711726,3,Mapet_,18/12/2021,"Actually everything is very nice and a very nice restaurant with very friendly staff, but the self-firing systems are extremely often triggered, especially at night in the area, and the very loud cracking noise drives us crazy. We wanted to stay several nights, but continue to travel annoyed after 1 sleepless night."
13620,1706584,4,Type,08/12/2021,Everything was OK. Recommendable.
13620,1701314,2,MARGIL,01/12/2021,"Location in a superb setting, alas for a price of 18 € for 2 nights the water is not available at essential times, toilet emptying impossible at departure times, toilets closed ... and I do not note the restaurant (I did not eat there) because the welcome makes you want to go ... too bad .."
13620,1684514,1,matsolitarios,10/11/2021,"I don't understand it getting worse and worse and on top of that, pay and in the pushy restaurant we won't Boberemos Goodbye !!!!"
13620,1680633,2,glueckskind75,06/11/2021,"We didn't like it, even if the location is actually nice. The whole night was a coming and going. In the morning from seven o'clock the shooting system went permanently, once in the immediate vicinity! The toilets were broken and therefore locked. The restaurant makes a good impression. The journey was relatively difficult, we won't be back."
13620,1680468,5,MacLindhe,06/11/2021,"Perfect stay! The way out there is a bit narrow, otherwise it is worth every cent, Also a good restaurant there. Nice walks and heaven for birdwatchers."
13620,1679344,4,JeremyTania,05/11/2021,"Large, quiet parking with a beautiful view. Ideal starting point for visiting. Very good restaurant next door. Not possible to fill fresh water because cut off at 9am in the morning."
13620,1676353,1,vert3,03/11/2021,"What a bad surprise, the change from free to € 9. Not against paying for customer services at the small restaurant next door for many years. Never again! .. Big mistake of the managers. Adios"
13620,1591765,3,TH7357,19/09/2021,"A mixed note because on the one hand an area very well located in the middle of a preserved natural space for bike rides or bird watching, the calm a price and correct pitches and on the other an obligation to leave before 9:30 am why? no water available when leaving because it is cut off at night for fear of abuse? the incessant opening and closing of a rubalise to access the site"
13620,1589401,1,geogeo,18/09/2021,Before it was free except for normal services the welcome not at all friendly when he sees you arriving he runs to put their tape lest you come back you can not even choose your location we give you a number and hop parked I will never come back
13620,1540000,5,olivierb44,02/09/2021,"Very nice clean place, well equipped, lost in the rice fields with a restaurant next door. 9 € per night and the reservation is only made online, it's a bit complicated but we can get there. I recommend."

13620,1524797,2,kokopelly,28/08/2021,We are right here. We are regulars in the specific area of this area but we must say that this time the water to clean the toilet cassettes and the water to refill do not work. If it doesn’t work how are we supposed to empty the blacks? Without being able to rinse the cassette? We can't get them to answer your contact phone. We plan to stop coming
13620,1478929,4,Beyclaude,18/08/2021,"Beautiful location 9 euros per night with water and drain, calm waking up in the morning with flights of hibis, herons and to the sound of donkeys the real footsteps of the grumpy motorhome operator super restaurant next door I will come back"
13620,1450082,1,Crusch,13/08/2021,"Very unfriendly welcome. At the reception they say that you have to book online. I'm struggling with the app. Finally, he can do it from the register. € 9. No water no electricity! Nothing around, isolated in the swamps. Filled with mosquitoes. Staying outside is impossible !!!!! When leaving, at 9 am, we realize that the water is off. Unable to fill. No one at the reception !!!!"
13620,1438312,1,bronch,11/08/2021,"The site well. the mosquito thing is hell. From 7pm, dress in thick clothes and only show your eyes, otherwise you are dead, ah! And if you can, put on glasses so as not to leave any surface of your body in sight, because he swears that they will cheat you there. The bathrooms are a shame, they suck. I'd rather pay double and have them at least have the decency to clean them."

13620,1420452,4,MariaSPRP,07/08/2021,"The site is good, it has a camper area for € 5 / night and an area for larger pitches for 8 (or 9 now I'm not sure) MANY MOSQUITOS from 7pm, but well located, good views and activities nearby."
13620,1380996,3,marcmope,30/07/2021,"Generally dirty toilets and it is highly recommended to bring mosquito nets and mosquito nets. There are many parking spaces and other services. Chiringuito, picnic tables and restaurant / cafeteria next door."
13620,1334813,1,serx85,18/07/2021,"Arrogance and antipathy of what seems to be the owner, quite bad management. If you want to stop there to visit the area for a while, they force you to park inside the private area."
13620,1296131,4,cbertran,04/07/2021,"Correct area although it looks expensive. But in the Delta there is not much choice for sleeping, unless you are paying triple in a campsite. It is true that it could have services such as electricity or a shower. People who complain about mosquitoes or firecrackers to scare away birds, I don’t understand it. These things, they come with the environment and have nothing to do with the area."
13620,1292129,1,gon943,03/07/2021,"Even if they pay me, I won't come back. It is not as good a site as they say. If you do not mind being eaten by mosquitoes ""suck blood"" even if you wear repellent all over your body, use a mosquito net or use insecticide in the cabin, it does not matter, they will be there day and night why others return and if you have a dog, it is better get used to the firecrackers of the hunters in the area. € 9 per night is expensive."
13620,1278357,3,Davidal86,26/06/2021,"Correct area, lacks services such as shower and to be able to wash dishes. For the price there should be that service. € 9 motorhomes € 5 Camper. The WC services are open from 9:00 to 18:00."
13620,1258563,2,piplette,16/06/2021,"Friends c forklift drivers, beware it has become paying 9 €, to be devoured by mosquitoes, to have very narrow pitches, and very dubious sanitary facilities, personally we go our way"
13620,1244300,3,lacayto,08/06/2021,Correct place to spend a night. We went in a Camper and well. a little dislike of the one who seemed to be the owner. The sinks were not very clean. Mosquitoes are something that is already known in the area and is normal.
13620,1242090,5,jferfre,07/06/2021,A perfect place to rest and have rice at La Casa de la Fusta. See birds of all kinds from the viewpoints. Essential mosquito repellent. The services work very well.
13620,1241260,4,lgd66,07/06/2021,Place in the middle of the Delta clean and suitable for motorhomes. To avoid I think the wk of great influence but outside the tourist seasons a calm and relaxing place! Only downside the firecrackers every 10 minutes day and night!
13620,1239064,2,isaura27,06/06/2021,"The place itself is good, but we paid 5 € (we went in a camper) to have access to toilets that are not always open and very unclean. The service of the bar was correct. There are a lot of mosquitoes and at night they don't stop hearing the sounds of firecrackers, which I understand are to scare away the beasts of the rice fields. Anyway, if you go in a camper it's better to go to sleep somewhere else."
13620,1212408,3,DiOSauto,23/05/2021,"You have to reserve! € 9 day. In a good place to start a route on foot or by bicycle. Next to the Casa de la Fusta, a good place to have lunch, dinner or a drink, with a couple of playgrounds and picnic tables. Area with different ""caged"" birds."
13620,1203476,5,pabloanpv,17/05/2021,"Very quiet, level site. Picnic tables and a lot of activities, see website. Perfect for casting gray and black. Two taps for filling. The only downside would be that the water for filling is cut off around 7:00 p.m., and they give it again around 9:00. Everything else is perfect!"
13620,1200590,4,Anfrie,15/05/2021,"Good place to explore the area by bike or car. If requested, water is also available outside of the specified times. Tourist information and bike rental is on site. On the day of departure we were allowed to stay until the evening. The restaurant next door is very good. We would come back."
13620,1186300,4,NicoleStucki,06/05/2021,"A parking lot with fresh water and sewage points. Toilets can be used around the clock. I paid € 9 with a campervan (without electric, I don't think there are). There were only a few campers on site, some came very late. A quiet place in the middle of rice fields. Beautiful fauna and flora, nature reserve for water birds. Restaurant was open."
13620,1185659,3,Rafa58,05/05/2021,"Not bad but without light, we still need parking spaces for our vehicles, so welcome."
13620,1183820,3,LaLola_en_ruta,02/05/2021,"One Sunday night we were four AC. To improve, poorly delimited and very small squares. All night with noise like shots."
13620,1174678,4,alttalmer,16/04/2021,"Super quiet place, we slept on 04/15 completely alone. Very friendly staff, we paid the next day since when we arrived there was no one (option to pay by credit card). We went with Camper but we had to pay € 9 as it was big. Option of emptying and filling with water. Toilets that we did not use as they were closed."
13620,1169345,5,javiernicolas,06/04/2021,"We have been to Easter. Now it is paid, € 9 for AC and € 5 for small campers, with the right to fill and empty. The treatment of the staff is EXCEPTIONAL, to say that they are friendly and attentive is not enough. We went with the kids and the pedal karts that they have for rent were lax over time, they helped us with a puncture on the bike, inflating wheels, etc. And without mosquitoes! You can not ask for more, THANK YOU for the deal."
13620,1168733,4,deepbluesky12,05/04/2021,Spent one night here to see the Ebro Delta by bike. Towards evening the place was completely full. Price for a night with a van was € 5. Payment is made at the small wooden house / shop by the toilets next to the restaurant. Toilets open until 10 p.m.
13620,1167977,3,JuanCarlosHinojosa,05/04/2021,Very pleasant area and starting point for cycling through the different corners of the delta. Do not be agonizing and do not go to the worker's plate in AC. It is not necessary and any day they will make it difficult for us because of the incidents who want to leave the AC's by the water.
13620,1164548,3,Pastorcinnn,02/04/2021,"Very friendly staff, quiet overnight, but for 9 euros a single unloading site for at least 60 seats, it has no toilets, no electricity, no Wi-Fi, no sink, only loading and unloading of water, I would rather pay more and have some more service, I would still repeat"
13620,1163651,3,memeloo,02/04/2021,"Ideal location, practically the only area within the Delta. The spaces are not very well defined, which leads to bad parking. There is only one area for emptying and filling with the consequent collapse in the mornings and afternoons. Notice to sailors, the remainder of Easter is full for reservations. Call before passing."
13620,1163481,3,martajat,02/04/2021,Complete Easter. € 9 per night. You sleep very quietly and the location is very good to visit the delta. The access roads are very bad and there is no electricity or toilet. If you park the car well you can take advantage of a part of the plot to put chairs and a table (just right). The van pitches are very small parking spaces.

13620,1155041,5,albert91,21/03/2021,"After the local police did not let us spend the night in another car park and visit others without finding a valid option, we decided to go to this one. They treated us very kindly and it has been a very good experience. The price for AC is € 9 (with emptying and filling) and on Sunday they have not set us time limits to go out. When we return here we will repeat!"

The place is easy to drive on, even and gravel. From 10 a.m. the groundskeeper opens the lid for the disposal of the chemical toilets and takes € 3 for this. The restaurant takes care of the physical well-being. The place is ideal for short-term stays."

Drinking water with reduced hours and emptying of water. The signs are confusing, you don't know where to park if you are a camper and theoretically you have to notify the restaurant that you are arriving and leave your information: -O. You can go for a bike ride through the nearby lagoons. There is a small snack bar and bathrooms."

There are quite a few insects at night that come to the light. You can hear birds, donkeys ... there are animals nearby to see them in the morning. A play area for children. And despite what the French complain about the noise that the Spanish make, I have not noticed more noise than in other areas of Spain and even France. To be a free area, that's fine."

Water service in very limited hours, and you must anticipate it, you have to get a ticket at the booth and get in line, for € 3 you can empty gray and black and fill clean. Ideal place for multi-family activities. The issue of mosquitoes, this weekend in particular there were clouds of them, so be very careful in critical hours because my wife has even come back riddled with Relec. Otherwise a very good location near the beach, and free parking, table area with benches to eat and free services from 9:00 to 18:00 approximately. Highly recommended."

13620,1022077,4,JordiGuillemas,02/09/2020,"Given that it is a private area and that they let it park for free is fine, too bad it is full of mosquitoes in the summer."
13620,1015857,3,miquelet16,30/08/2020,The place is privileged but there is no shade. Good idea because the parking lot is very big and many activities can be done but the water change can only be done in a reduced schedule in the morning and can be a problem.

The owner of the parkimg and restaurant very friendly. Let's take care of this area. Responding to Ismap30, who comments that it is a “shit of a place, because pyrotechnics scared their dogs”, I inform him that it is not pyrotechnics, they are saved from hollow cargo, to protect the rice crops from birds. I also have dogs and they were not scared, and that they have a very bad time with firecrackers. But it was not the same roar. ."

It can also get very windy down there."

Knowing that the owner is aware of the big problems of ants and lets you leave with a camper completely covered with ants both from the outside and the inside. Then you will have found your happiness. I strongly recommend this place!"

Only problem is there are literally thousands of mosquitos. You can't escape them. Would not return for this reason. Services out of date and restaurant looks like something out of a zombie movie or a place that hasn't been touched since the 80's.
13620,536393,3,katyano84,02/07/2019,Correct. starting point for the beach. noisy at night because of petarades to frighten the birds. mosquitoes are kings. Average restaurant considering the prices.

Free area, large plots, emptying and filling for 3 € (available 9-13h), bar-restaurant (delicious rices) and wide range of activities. Virgin area, pure nature, a paradise of beaches.

13621,3276310,4,PereHerrero,09/09/2023,Parking on the outskirts of Torredembarra with access to the beach (50 meters away). Little vegetation and little shade but recommended. Between the beach and the train track.
13621,2776522,5,Maufroyclau,22/05/2023,"large car park with sea view, without service but terminal not far, small town and nice seaside"
13621,2610437,4,Siegfriedwagnerkemper,15/03/2023,"A good place for Freisteher.Die prohibition signs are only at the entrance to the beach.The place is level and directly behind the dune that separates it from the sea.From time to time a train runs past.Hardly heard, it's gone again.Be careful with the driveway. Small slalom through concrete blocks before going up in a semicircle."
13621,2577788,4,JuditaD.,14/02/2023,Nice place with loads of space for many (big) cars. The railway was indeed noisy and disturbing. But the beach and the dunes are very nice to visit for a day.
13621,2540004,3,YvesVerlaecke,03/01/2023,I really have no idea what makes this place so special. It is an ordinary unkempt beach parking lot. The railway next to it creates a lot of noise. We stood there in the afternoon to sunbathe and drove into the mountains to find a quiet place.
13621,2511577,5,bibi59700,03/12/2022,"a great place right next to the beach,"
13621,2215268,5,MITCHBMW,11/08/2022,This pitch is the vision of paradise come true. Pitch right on the beach. The beach is incredibly fine and the water incredibly clear and beautiful.
13621,1714759,3,bj41,23/12/2021,"close to the railway, a bit noisy. No trash, no water. 5 motorhomes on December 23 there is still room. perfect for a short walk to the port."
13621,1524443,2,Estela7Night,28/08/2021,"The location is fabulous if your goal is the beach and just parking. The advantage is that you do not have to move the vehicle for it. Disadvantages: the noise of the train, there are no services, and we played a bottle with music. The low note is due to noise and dirt; extremely dirty."
13621,1401607,2,Juanmaboxer,04/08/2021,"The truth is that in principle despite being somewhat dirty, the place is not bad, but when the kids arrive to make a bottle and everything changes and not even the train bothers like them, do not worry about the police not showing up even when there is touch curfew, I annoy more sleeping in my van than 100 kids making a bottle, I will not return to this place"

13621,1170078,3,CamperLion,08/04/2021,"A lot with a lot of space to park. In winter and spring calm. Although caravans are prohibited, as the sign in one of the photos indicates, at the beginning of April we slept with our van. If you are a light sleeper, the noise of the passing trains is annoying, since it is next to the tracks."

13621,1104584,3,Dorifg,25/10/2020,"We spent two days, we did not stay to sleep because apart from the fact that there is a sign that prohibits it, the train passes by the side and late in the afternoon we were alone and we did not like it at all"
13621,1042987,4,edouard1227,12/09/2020,"We spent a few days there a lot of people during the day, beach 50m away, but we slept in the tarmac parking a bit higher"

13621,947175,4,Mariazg,10/08/2020,We were there Saturday night with 5 AC and several cars. Next to the beach and close to bars and promenade. The parking lot fills up during the day. Until 2 there was a group making a bottle.
13621,775406,5,edube,02/02/2020,Very good place near the beach to spend the day. We have not stayed overnight but it looks very good. Recommendable.
13621,775030,4,VALLESCOM,01/02/2020,We have spent the day in front of the beach. We have set chairs and table to eat. Also the awning. Very calm.
13621,549878,2,JORDI2EURA,12/07/2019,"It is forbidden to spend the night, and in summer they watch over it. The other parking lot is also better informed in this application, parking next to the bridge that goes to the Barri Maritim. This place is good because it is touching the paths that go to the beach but only good day."

13621,127277,4,Fy64,14/04/2017,Parking very nice for a lunch break and immediate access to the beach. Forbidden at night. Very good for day parking.
13621,85728,4,luciaberbeach,27/07/2016,Very good place to stop and go to the beach or visit the town. At the entrance there is a sign that says forbidden caravans and motorhomes from 22 to 8. Despite that and the comments we saw we decided to try and had no problem for a night.
13621,78078,3,Thumper,23/06/2016,"Large flat area with direct view of dunes and sea. Beach shower, sea water beautifully clean. Seaside side of railway line. Portaloo toilet on beach, stayed 2 nights, no police, even though sign said No parking 22-08 hours. Recommended"

13635,2523207,5,XeviPA,17/12/2022,"We didn't sleep there, but it's a great place to park and visit the sanctuary. The terrain is a bit uneven, but it's definitely a good place to spend the night. It doesn't have any kind of services."
13635,2345392,3,Pichulina,06/09/2022,"The place is ideal to visit the monastery but... We had to leave, at 2am some young people came who sat next to us having a drink (having all the parking free), they woke us up and we did not hesitate to leave."

13658,3284388,3,Nit46,11/09/2023,"Correct area to spend the night. The center is a 30-minute walk away. The road is close and you can hear the noise of the cars but it is not exaggerated. If the motorhome spaces are full and you park in a car park, make sure you really fit inside the lines because we have been fined €45 for occupying two spaces."
13658,3278879,3,Viktorbcn86,10/09/2023,"A bit punky place, very full of AC and some cars that seem to live there. A lot of truck traffic during the day, not at night, since we decided to leave. Electricity is paid through a machine (€6.5 12h) all the places were occupied and one outlet was in use. We went somewhere else to spend the night."
13658,3277655,4,cragnagna,09/09/2023,"great! next to the beach and tables under a pine forest with all the services available free of charge, not the city except elec. rather quiet at night despite the road and the railway nearby. The city center is about 40 minutes away as well promenade along the ocean and another beach. a little shade depending on location. Alright"
13658,3272237,5,francisbriais,08/09/2023,super direct beach plus tables in the shade of pine trees
13658,3261234,2,JeanPierreFau,05/09/2023,the location could be superb it is right in front of the beach but there are more camper vans than places therefore stuck together and an infernal noise day and night with the trucks and the train. for me it's really to be avoided
13658,3256900,3,ascenrs,04/09/2023,"When we arrived at the motorhome area it was full, but in the parking lot right next to it there were some motorhomes and vans parked. We spent the night there without any problem. PS: it is a short walk of about 40 minutes to the town."
13658,3236670,2,javeasteve5,30/08/2023,"Had to stay for local gas repair.  So noisy, especially so from 06.00hrs but even during night, constant traffic.  Very busy as both aire and overspill car park rammed full. Gijon not particularly attractive, use services during day to avoid morning queue. Saw toilet cassettes being rinsed with both taps, the taps being inside cassette exit tube…."
13658,3236407,4,xevifar,29/08/2023,Perfect area to spend the night and visit Gijon. Although there are many here you find a place. urban bus stop nearby
13658,3234563,5,365puestasdesol,29/08/2023,A very good area. Good situation to sleep in silence and a 30-minute walk to the center. Thanks to the town hall of Gijón
13658,3227040,3,lumbertito,27/08/2023,"We were lucky to find a site, it seems that there is little movement of caravans and it is always full. When we left, it didn't take them a minute to occupy the square. The place did not give me much confidence, but in the end we spent a quiet night after seeing Gijón and enjoying Asturian gastronomy. There is noise from trucks going to the port."
13658,3219300,5,lorenaafonso,26/08/2023,"area for motorhomes, with an area with tables and benches under the trees and in front of the beach, we arrived around 8:00 p.m. and we spent the night, it is a bit noisy because the road passes right next to it to enter the pier, but everything brilliant"
13658,3217921,5,anais95,25/08/2023,Excellent site. There are many parking spaces. You have electricity at 6 and 12 hours. There is a machine in case you need some car or food. Bus stop next door. Walk from the beach. I highly recommend it!!
13658,3204510,3,gesvil,23/08/2023,"Good area, close to the beach, during the week it is noisy in the morning, entrance to the port, few places but it seems that there is no problem to spend the night in the car parks that are attached, about 60 vehicles on average in the 2 days we stayed, the best option to go to the center the car-share, with hi mobility €3 to go to cimadevilla, we are 4 so it is cheaper than the bus"
13658,3202577,4,Adone93,23/08/2023,"Pros: Free, close to the beach. Cons: very narrow, small, far from the center"
13658,3197464,5,RaulFG74,22/08/2023,"Excellent free area next to the beach. You have a 24h light option for €12, but there are only 10 sockets. We arrived in the morning and we had no problems finding a place with light, but those who arrived around 8:00 p.m. were left without a place…. Good filling and emptying service."
13658,3196876,1,challanger12,21/08/2023,"impossible to park, parking lot next to it also filled with car and motorhome mixed, I do not recommend at all."
13658,3175479,1,crichu98,18/08/2023,"The city council should start managing the use of the Area, there are people who stick for 4 days without moving, vans with mattresses parked inside the Area, which surely in the technical sheet are neither a home van nor a Motorhome. A little more police to control this or start charging for parking to avoid people smarter than the rest."
13658,3153747,3,grberm,15/08/2023,Good area to spend a few days next to the beach. Easy access. The cars park where the motorhomes
13658,3141767,4,Sin.deentrega,14/08/2023,"Large area, perfect loading and unloading. It is usually full, but with a little patience it is easy to find a place. Right next to the beach there are picnic tables. Those of us who are en route can't stand more than two nights as the noise from the train and the vehicles coming and going from the port is unbearable. Just enough to visit Gijón."
13658,3133874,1,saihala,13/08/2023,"motorhome area ok you can also be in the parking area but there is a problem with a user who must be there all year round, he plays music all night to annoy and looks for drills with the users, we all end up leaving the area and more than one argued with the unpresentable, municipal and national did not appear (to be avoided)"
13658,3115619,3,millera,10/08/2023,"It could be a magnificent area, but more than half of the spaces are occupied by residents of Gijón who use it as private parking, one even boasted of having his teleworking position there. Regrettable!"
13658,3111592,1,LidiaDePradenaMelero,09/08/2023,"A disastrous motorhome area, there are only 6 places in a Gijón and the campers are installed for weeks without moving. I do not recommend it and Gijón would have to set up a correct area, we had to leave without visiting the city."
13658,3106685,2,mjosesosa,09/08/2023,"In this area it is next to the downtown beach, you have to take the bus. The area is very small. Only a few AC. The rest are parked outside in the parking lot next door. That same night they were fining all the motorhomes that stayed the night and left the lines and occupied two places. The place is not too quiet. It has picnic areas next to it and people make parties."
13658,3105401,4,erperi14,09/08/2023,"Very good place to visit Gijón, 20 meters from the beach, you can park without too much problem, there is a little noise from the road but it is bearable, I have read in some comments that it is only for Motorhomes, here there are all kinds of people sleeping campers, I don't know why you make these kinds of comments when they are completely false."
13658,3092870,3,inma1992,07/08/2023,"It's okay, close to the center and in front of a beach. They take very few motorhomes, from the hard drive forward if possible, the rest would be badly parked, the local police informed us. It is for motorhomes, not for vans or campervans, only ""Cars"" since they have a better size and can park in another place, making it easier for everyone to enjoy! It has to charge light for 6 or 12 hours"
13658,3091586,3,jumiclea,06/08/2023,Perfect for serving. I saw the police put a ticket on a badly parked motorhome.
13658,3082511,4,WarwickParsons,05/08/2023,"Lovely off grid parking, area is kept very clean.  Traffic noise didn't keep us awake. I would have given it 5 stars except there are literally 100s of campervans fighting for a few spots"
13658,3061949,3,LuilliVan,02/08/2023,"well known, long-term caravanners, noise coming trucks."
13658,3048883,2,cellentano,30/07/2023,"The location of the pitch is good, right on the beach. Unfortunately very crowded at the end of July. Quite noisy at night, so you can't sleep peacefully. Power connection didn't work. Definitely good to stay in off-season, but I wouldn't stay here again in peak season."
13658,3037017,3,zucche,28/07/2023,"The place in terms of location is great! The spot on the beach side is great but we got there early, the others are pretty bad. A lot of noise from people screaming, cars entering the area and people cleaning the AC all at dawn, people play loud music during the day. Finding a vacancy is difficult, the ones that have it, put a motorcycle occupying and those who live there and don't leave, not giving the opportunity to others. 5G Vodafone perfect"
13658,3027103,1,yosoyales,27/07/2023,awful night. Until 3 in the morning with music and fights from the youngsters in the park and at 5 trucks begin to pass that seem to get into the caravan. I don't know how this can be so crowded. You can tell they don't want us around here because they don't take care of us. I do not recommend it or crazy
13658,3026766,1,OscaR7676,26/07/2023,"Noisy site, constant trucks and train passing. There was a fight at night between people fixed there that several policemen had to go to break it up. You don't sleep well. It's fine for a water change. We went the next night to the expert parking lot, paying €5 for total peace of mind and close to the center."
13658,3022448,3,rocofurgo,26/07/2023,"The area is good, it has plenty of spaces and if you don't have a parking lot outside, you can park, the beach is right next door and there is a bus stop nearby to go downtown. But nobody mentions the entrance to the port of trucks that from early morning and throughout the day are coming and going until late at night, or the train that is right in front, those details are also said."
13658,3019176,4,lluisromeuporta,25/07/2023,"it was full motorbikes taking places, cars... we had to go to the parking lot next door"
13658,3017532,5,rebame,25/07/2023,It has a great location for visiting the city. We did not spend the night but the neighbors told us that they had slept well. Thank you Gijón for the area
13658,3016777,1,FamiliaRodriguezGonzalez,25/07/2023,"Lots of regular people, little space, a place for young people at night until 2 in the morning, music, voices, no rest, not even for a stop, I won't be back. A disastrous place for dogs, they cannot enter the beach and there is no place for them anywhere."
13658,3013424,2,Richardtkd,24/07/2023,"The only good thing about it is the location, but it is practically impossible to park because it is seen that there are people who spend weeks occupying a space, they travel with motorcycles and change water with buckets so as not to move their motorhome for days. There should be a parking limit control by the city council. The surrounding environment does not give much confidence either, it looks like there are robberies."
13658,3004059,5,MarioRoGa,22/07/2023,"We spent a quiet night in the parking lot next door, as it was full. The next morning, I entered the area. Right next to the beach and the center of Gijón by bus."
13658,2998625,5,Escalam,21/07/2023,"as always very good and I was lucky to be within the area, I spent two very good days, as always and campers who spend many days as it is free and next to the beach, thanks to the Gijón City Council and the port to which it belongs"
13658,2994639,2,ChavesSousa,20/07/2023,I liked the services and the location. But I don't recommend sleeping there because at night it's impossible due to the noise.
13658,2993555,3,andrewfranki,20/07/2023,"We only came to empty and fill water. Is free. There were many caravans spending the night, it shows that it has a lot of traffic. They told us that the police come by every now and then and that it's hard to sleep, but we didn't sleep there so we have no idea."
13658,2986335,2,arantxabcn,19/07/2023,"a very noisy area, a lot of truck traffic next door, also since it has some picnic tables, the young people get into partying and there is no way to sleep. We parked in the spaces outside the area because we weren't able to find a space all day, it seems that those who are, are settled there, a pity."
13658,2960691,5,Annikaschnitzler,13/07/2023,"Great place! From 10/11pm it was quiet. Have slept well! In the evening young people came and made music in the adjacent park. I thought it was great! No drunk teenagers outside the door. The people there were all very friendly. Laundry around the corner, showers on the beach, V/E works too. Were in the aquarium, which was also really great to see. was fun Thanks for that!"
13658,2949001,2,Betty2612,11/07/2023,"has the merit of existing but too much noise from music until 2 a.m. then the noise of trucks from cars from 5 a.m. very little slept too sensitive to noise, on the other hand facing the beach very little space, a lot of leeches in my opinion, I saw and spent one night, that's enough for me!"
13658,2948602,3,kaxu,11/07/2023,"area that would be well placed to visit the city, but already it would be necessary to be able to park, then stuck between a roundabout and the picnic area it's hellish, we were treated to a flamenco concert until 2 a.m. morning and from 6 am there is an incessant flow of cars and trucks. Light sleeper avoid this place."
13658,2943432,4,Marian4night,09/07/2023,"Well leveled and very good services for filling and emptying water. The noise from the trucks going to the port starts around 8 AM. During the night it is quiet, except for some users who do not respect the rest of others (loud music until dawn, the dog barking all night...) Ideally it is on the beach and with shady picnic areas next to it. Light, €12 24 hours"
13658,2942532,4,JuanraMobyDick,09/07/2023,"Like every year we've come, it's full, but after a couple of hours they left us a free place. As they have already said before, it is seen that at least 40% of the users are permanent or long-term people; In short, if there is no control there is nothing to do."
13658,2938853,4,jiadradan,08/07/2023,"Very good motorhome parking. On the beach, with tables and shade. very crowded Noise from trucks, people in the parking lot and people going to the beach. At night you can sleep. Many people live for a long time, leaving those who come to spend the night without a place. Stops nearby to see Gijón. Ticket price €1.50 X Trip. Buses 4 and 6 go to the Center."
13658,2915092,3,IglesiasFatima,02/07/2023,"Very good location on the beachfront, the only drawback is that many trucks pass by, there is a lot of bearable noise, the maritime freight port is next door. emptying and filling water. light. the beach water is very cold being from the south."
13658,2876979,3,Sieteleguas,21/06/2023,"It is not one of the best places to spend the night (somewhat noisy, especially if you sleep on a weekday, it is right next to the port entrance, so many trucks pass by) but, if you are lucky and there is room when you arrive, it is acceptable . The city center is a bit far, but can be reached in about 45 minutes on foot. It has to empty black and gray, and tap to fill."
13658,2868050,5,chanchito,18/06/2023,"we spent one night in the first days of June. we had a good time everything. a little noisy at night, but we are on the side of the road that leads to the port. thanks to the municipality for this place. although Gijón deserves a bigger motorhome stop."

13658,2840274,3,guiry,10/06/2023,"Good place to unload and fill up, beach right next door, we only stopped for a few hours since it was packed and narrow in the car area, some live there and you don't have many opportunities to take a seat. But thanks to the Gijon Town Hall."
13658,2820183,3,ducrem,04/06/2023,"We went to change the waters on Friday, June 2, 2023 in the morning and it was very crowded with both cars and motorhomes, maybe it was bad luck but it gave the impression that they had been there for a long time. Luckily we had already stayed two nights in a parking lot in the center for €5 a day, quiet parking you can spend the night and it is highly recommended if you want to go out for tapas in Gijón."
13658,2814727,1,ToniAgudo,03/06/2023,"We went to sleep at 11 p.m., coming back from Bilbao and it was amazing... We went to park even further away but inside the parking lot and there were bad people around. A local woman who took the car came to us and told us that it was not a good area that we better park near the cars since they stole a lot. Bad feelings from Gijon, if you can park in the park above next to the beach."
13658,2808988,3,Tarttine,01/06/2023,Has the merit of existing. We are many and far from the city. Very noisy. The services are free. Luckily we had the bikes because the city and the beaches are beautiful. Lots of bike paths.

13658,2713778,5,LeticiaC.A.,01/05/2023,"We have been one night and the truth is that it is very comfortable, it is very crowded but we had no problem finding a place and that is a long weekend. On the beach and with a very cool picnic area next to it. We have not used the services, but it does have them. Recommended."
13658,2712702,5,Valencan,01/05/2023,"Extraordinary location next to the beach, with a promenade, shadows, picnic tables... A good combination in the center of Gijón. Along with the access to the port of Musel, it can be annoying for people with fine ears. Two negative things: - The price of the connection to the light is VERY expensive. I have paid €6.5 for 12 hours. - There is no limit of stay, so there are permanently occupied places,"
13658,2709963,5,Chinche99,30/04/2023,"The location is perfect, beach next door and urban bus very close, get a bus card so that the trips cost €0.38"

13658,2708340,3,marsuma7,30/04/2023,"The only area in Gijón, far from the center but next to one of the city's beaches and a picnic area. At the entrance to the port, a lot of traffic. The service area is a shame, with one of the faucets broken and the WC discharge area at ground level and without water. Gijón deserves something else."
13658,2704239,2,mb56,28/04/2023,It's not our way of traveling stuck between the port entrance and a roundabout we leave room for others we follow the coast to find a pleasant area

13658,2670082,2,Reisefreak,14/04/2023,"Electricity now costs 7.5 euros for 12 hours on April 14, 2023 and 12 euros for 24 hours. Parking is free. The machine can also be used without knowledge of Spanish. Payment also with EC card. Suitable as an overnight stop if you can live with the traffic noise. Annoying is the mobile homes that are permanently parked without being inhabited, blocking the few spaces for travelers passing through."
13658,2624272,3,lavacaenruta,25/03/2023,"The area is quite good, very level but super noisy being at the very entrance to the port. The price of electricity seems like a joke (€20/24 hours). Thank you for this area that allows us to visit this beautiful city."

13658,2595370,4,Carlostara21,01/03/2023,"Free parking although you must pay for services. As a point to improve, they should give options when contracting electricity, since it only gives you two options: 12h at €6 or 24h at €10."
13658,2593294,4,Libancito,27/02/2023,"A good place to visit Gijón. And free. You only pay light, if you want it. It is true that you are in the part of the port and there is noise from transport, but we slept perfectly. The truth is that the location is worth it."
13658,2581261,4,hicham44,17/02/2023,"Dogs cannot be released since it is very close to the road where trucks pass and it is also prohibited in that area by the Gijón town hall as well as on the beach that is directly opposite, although the site is very good, with picnic areas in the same AC area, we slept well despite the little noise."

13658,2529167,5,matze107,26/12/2022,"Well done by the community here! From 10 p.m. it is definitely so quiet that you can sleep comfortably. If you don't get along with the Spanish way of life, or if you can't stand a few cars driving by at night, you should go to your finely divided campsite or stay at home."
13658,2526346,4,cathy-alain,22/12/2022,"Well defined pitches with all amenities, free water. Electricity with payment at the automaton. Ideal for visiting the city. Thank you to the municipality for making these locations available to us. Only downside is the noise at night."

13658,2437895,2,Lesaintbernard,11/10/2022,"If you have the possibility to go elsewhere, do so otherwise it helps but the number of passers-by in the car at night is disturbing."
13658,2423182,3,marpaufel,04/10/2022,"It is a shame that a city as beautiful as Gijón has such a neglected area. To begin with, there are people who use it to leave their motorhome as a parking lot all year round. The same thing happens in the adjoining parking lot where they leave them and leave. People even live in cars. The emptying and filling area is somewhat shabby. Local businesses appreciate our visit."

It has free emptying and filling services and then some squares have paid electricity. Definitely a good place to spend the night!"

13658,2293952,1,NinjaSantana,24/08/2022,It's always crowded... a shame. There should be more places like this... right in the center of the city and with a lot of noise because it is right next to the road... so there is no one to rest... in big cities like this there should be more places so we campers bring money to spend in the cities .... they should take us more into account.

We asked a local policeman if we could raise a pop-up roof in the adjoining car park, answering that to camp you have to go to a campsite, due to the lack of knowledge of the policeman between parking, spending the night and camping, and the fear that they would wake us up in the middle of the night, we went to another city to avoid being fined, which, although appealable, is a nuisance"

13658,1945787,4,ConnieLiam,04/06/2022,Can see it’s a popular spot. Was a bit hard to sleep at night because of the trains and bins being collected at 11:30pm. But was fine to sleep there once you get used to it. Clean and safe spot.
13658,1934220,5,MatthiasBeck,31/05/2022,"Very large parking lot with partition for mobile homes. Since all camper places were occupied, we and others simply parked in the parking lot in front of it. It was no problem for 2 days. The beach was right in front of the door. We liked it very much. Thanks very much!"
13658,1930365,3,vh95,30/05/2022,Completely crowded. The locals have parked their vehicle here even though they are not there. The power connection is no longer in operation.
13658,1929555,4,frannetpat,29/05/2022,Parking near the beach. Old town 45 mins walk. Tonight we are about fifty c.car.
13658,1918076,5,gilda2015,26/05/2022,"Spectacular parking lot on the beach, area with services and bus that takes you to the center in 10 minutes, walking half an hour."
13658,1886875,2,rosa1988,13/05/2022,"Space located about 1/2 hour from the center of Gijón. It is possible to empty and fill it with water, but to fill it, it is very poorly done. It is surrounded by rubbish bins and on the edge of the curb, which made it difficult for us to approach the AC properly. The worst is the noise, it is at the entrance and exit of vehicles-trucks from the port and falling asleep has been quite complicated."
13658,1885309,2,daniecreuse23,12/05/2022,"We arrived yesterday evening with the aim of spending the day in Gijon... After a very bad night due to the incessant passage of trucks, cars and trains, we left this place without leaving you a penny... if you don't know not receive tourists, they are not inclined to spend in your city."
13658,1884452,4,JorgeHdez,11/05/2022,"Suitable place for loading/unloading water. The only area authorized to spend the night in Gijón. With line 1 you get to the old town, being able to get off at several stops. You can do the return on foot, it is about 35 minutes going quietly. The downside is the truck traffic entering the port. The beach is next door and there are parks and green areas."
13658,1883197,3,Levoyageur26,11/05/2022,"Beware of motorhomes over 7.50m. Ours is 9.30m, we are distributed immediately. Lots of passenger cars. The beach is pretty, but today, a lot of seaweed..."
13658,1877663,5,Encarni46,08/05/2022,A spectacular site !! We only spent one night but great to see the city and enjoy the beach
13658,1871244,5,viajandogeral,05/05/2022,"Everything Free except electricity, excellent place, in front of the sea, one of the few in Europe free. Many places, 2 km from the center, everything close."
13658,1871147,3,Ragnarelgris,05/05/2022,"We stayed one night, a good place but in the morning a lot of noise from trucks and cars being close to the port, otherwise a privileged place being next to the beach."
13658,1869375,3,sun1,04/05/2022,"Very noisy hope it stops for the night!!!! Otherwise it’s a nice place, we must make the best of things for nothing, thank you."
13658,1861151,4,EvaCopperwear,30/04/2022,"Very nice place for a free stay/night. Can get loud on weekends. You can book electricity at the Automat, which also sells camper items like clean water/WC tabs. And also chocolate ;) public toilets near by for 0.30€ (10,20,5 cent coins required)."
13658,1859909,3,hsnaps,29/04/2022,"Yes there's a beach but it overlooks an industrial area so it's not particularly nice and dogs aren't allowed. It worked for a convenient night but bring earplugs, it's very loud at time with lorries going to the port. Best thing is the vending machine which had all sorts of motorhome items like hose adapters and toilet chemicals, plus food and drinks which is handy if you're missing anything."
13658,1852717,2,Cco34,25/04/2022,"Very well placed to go to the beach, a bit far from the city center. Avoid if you want to sleep, very noisy with the entrance to an industrial site in front of the rest area. Unworthy of a city like Gijon"
13658,1846888,5,tobiandlaura,22/04/2022,"Nice free parking space that can offer electricity, water and sewage. Spent one night here and it was very pleasant. The city is also quickly there. The location is great!"
13658,1836788,5,CINZIAontheROAD,19/04/2022,"Beautiful area, very busy and like other realities, narrow and very close car parks. You are very close to the beach, a discreet green area with tables and shade. The environment appears very pleasant with the possibility of having electricity. We used the loading / unloading area only, finding it very comfortable, clean and functional. Too bad for us not to have also stopped for the night."
13658,1830595,3,popajoel,17/04/2022,"Giant car park with extension on the outskirts with free emptying and filling, only interest because far from the city, 4.5€ for 7 hours of electricity and continuous comings and goings on this Easter weekend. Bus departure nearby to visit the city by bus, here neither metro nor tramway. A good stop Pee!! To be avoided during the week for the activity of the port. Decision not to sleep there."
13658,1828969,4,milleralabama,16/04/2022,"Good area for the city, although it remains small. Noisy in the morning due to the passage of trucks to the port. with several bus lines to the center. With vending machine for possible forgetfulness"
13658,1825102,4,silvilanas,15/04/2022,"Large area with free emptying and filling service, it is close to a beach and the seaport, the only drawback is that there is a lot of truck traffic. there is some parking with an option of electricity and a machine with some basic products such as liquid and pills for the poti, adapter for the filling water tap, etc ..."
13658,1822020,5,loscaravaneros,14/04/2022,We arrived at 3 in the afternoon and there was no room. So we just empty and fill. The services are very good. Location looks great.
13658,1818492,5,RAFSS,13/04/2022,"Excellent place by the sea, with all the services and a step away from Gijón, quiet and safe night."
13658,1815649,4,EOI,11/04/2022,"For a big city like Gijón, one area is too small, it would be necessary another one at the other end, this one is almost always full and the parking lot next door too. From very early on there is noise from the trucks and cars that go to the port."
13658,1810923,5,LAXIENA,08/04/2022,I thank the council of Gijon again for this Area. Now older people put electricity on us. a marvel. thank you
13658,1796543,5,vidadetres,26/03/2022,"Enough places, also next to it there is a parking lot that you can park, easy access and maneuverability. Draining gray water, black water and filling it, in front of the beach (one pass) we traveled with a 3-year-old girl and at 10:00 p.m. we slept, along the road but very acceptable. Thanks Gijon."
13658,1795828,3,MC4333,26/03/2022,Thank you Gijón for allowing us to empty and drink water. I've been in the area for a week and it was always full. I hope they open another one in the Molinon area.
13658,1791801,5,DaviddeTudela,22/03/2022,What I highlight the most in this/this area is the machine for selling products on motorhomes at a good price for everything.
13658,1789446,3,HooLee,20/03/2022,"The loading and unloading area is a bit awkward since the tap is not next to the black lid. Level squares and next to the beach. It's not central, it's the port area and the train tracks."
13658,1780727,2,bkb,12/03/2022,Free parking in the port area. On the edge of the beach prohibited to dogs. Free water and garbage. TV reception complicated if you park under the pines. Very noisy (continuous traffic of trucks going to the warehouses). At least 40 mins walk to the city center.
13658,1779707,3,arcadiaego,11/03/2022,"Large car park with services at the entrance to the port and in front of the beach. For light sleepers, it is necessary to provide earplugs!"
13658,1777320,2,MauiBelin,08/03/2022,"Great place near the water and plenty of tables etc. Only problem, on the side of the road. The noise during the passage of trucks breaks the tranquility in the middle of the day. In the evening it must be much better."
13658,1775915,3,juancgavilan,06/03/2022,"We have only stopped for a few hours, but finally we did not want to spend the night, because we did not feel very safe in the area. The surroundings are not pretty, and people take their dogs loose, which was uncomfortable for us since we have 2, but we always keep them on a leash. The good thing is that it is very convenient to park, 20 meters from the sea, parking is free, and there are paid services. At 200 or 300 meters there is a mercadona, several cafeterias."
13658,1769384,5,gramos,28/02/2022,"It is very good as a motorhome stop, it has emptying and filling services. It is attached to the beach with trees and a park and picnic area. It is good to walk to Gijon, the beach is quite ugly because it is attached to the Port, but it is a very practical stop."
13658,1769242,1,asiererci,28/02/2022,The site is not bad but the night is horrible. Lots of traffic (lots of noise). Not recommended for an overnight stay.
13658,1761179,3,xunpugnodieuro,20/02/2022,"We didn't sleep here, the place is on the beach but attached to the harbor entrance and the railway. It gives the idea of a very noisy place. However there is loading and unloading."
13658,1754686,4,winypu,13/02/2022,We have spent a quiet night. next to the beach. walking distance from the town 4km more less. nearby bus stop at the roundabout next to the gas station. good service

13658,1747228,4,vicenteacebal,04/02/2022,"Good area attached to the beach and park. Near bus stop 10 minutes downtown, walking 40 minutes downtown. Next to the entrance to the port, as we were on the weekend there was no movement of trucks."
13658,1740787,5,BomberR1,24/01/2022,"Great, and the beach 20 meters away."
13658,1737586,4,B1ch0,20/01/2022,"Even though you can hear the trucks coming into the port(it's not that unbearable), it's a good AC area. Very complete, and although somewhat far from the center, taking a walk (45 min), or by bus you arrive in 10 min"
13658,1735010,4,Luliss,16/01/2022,"AC area of the city with services. It is away from the center but can be easily reached on foot or by bus. There is a vending machine with useful products and for electricity. Lots of long-term parked resident ACs. We spent two nights and it was very quiet, although sometimes some noise from the trucks entering the port."
13658,1721522,1,nataliafp88,01/01/2022,"We have tried to rest a little tonight, but as some comments say, groups of ""people"" come to make bottles in front of the parking lot, playing music and making rest impossible. I recommend? No. In the end we had to leave the station."
13658,1721520,1,chester.81,01/01/2022,"loud music in the middle of the night. highly discouraged. pity the place deserves it, right next to the beach."
13658,1715936,3,neki9,26/12/2021,"The place is fine, water and electricity which is a new machine with which you can buy with a card 12h, 24h 36 or 48 is the maximum stay. A lot of noise from trucks and others is the entrance to the port. Walking is a very nice walk and nearby there are some good and cheap cider bars."
13658,1715281,4,jcast,24/12/2021,"Perfect to be quiet, the city is close and there are services around, recommended 100% 100"
13658,1712240,3,huanag,19/12/2021,Good spot for charging. A beach nearby with cold beachshower. The surroundings except the beach are not very pretty.
13658,1708029,5,calle5621,11/12/2021,"Great space, everything you need. Was a little concerned that it would be too loud at night because of the traffic to the port. But everything was fine and we slept well."
13658,1676028,5,neskatxita,03/11/2021,"We spent the night in this motorhome area on the night of October 31. It is next to the port, and from other comments I thought there would be a lot of trucks passing by, but we rested very well. A bit far from the center, but with a nearby bus that takes you in 15 minutes. Filling and emptying of water. Paid electricity (not yet activated, but will do so soon). Recommendable!!"
13658,1671699,4,trillonyotero,31/10/2021,Far from the center but quiet
13658,1670647,4,Francesco57,31/10/2021,"Good place, convenient and free loading and unloading. A little far from the center, but you can take a nice walk or bike. A little noisy, but it can go anyway. Recommended."
13658,1667937,3,openend2020,29/10/2021,"Narrow parking bays. No camping behavior allowed, but there are plenty of shady picnic tables and you are right on the beach in the harbor area. Especially early in the morning noise from trucks. V / E and dumpster, no toilet. Overall completely ok for a free city car park."
13658,1667846,4,nathlz,29/10/2021,"On the beach, at the entrance to the port, a little traffic ... to spend a night, very good"

13658,1645501,2,AxouMat,15/10/2021,"Lots of noise being at the entrance to the port of the city, a lot of trucks. The train passes right by too. On the other hand, the access to the beach is top. The arrival of the Nomadas terminals which will provide electricity will be a big plus in this car park which for the moment is polluted by people who come to wash their cars with loud music early in the morning."
13658,1627181,5,Killxtron,04/10/2021,Excellent place to spend the night and go to the beach! Free services! Water and gray water drainage
13658,1626568,3,maevaakp,04/10/2021,"Good area. Convenient for spending an evening in the city center and returning on foot (about 30 minutes walk). We slept there on Sunday evening and no problem. Indeed, a car passes in the morning to distribute bread and pastries."
13658,1621316,1,Adampitch,02/10/2021,"Avoid Friday night or Saturday. The picnic area is full of people drinking and you know, after 5 am it is impossible to sleep because of the screams, fights, music and the incessant passing of trucks. A pity, the site is beautiful."
13658,1618312,5,JMAZ21,30/09/2021,"Good Area. A bit far from the old town, but in a little step, you get to the center. They are setting up electricity infrastructure for payment."
13658,1614145,3,frannetpat,28/09/2021,Very complete at this time. But we were there on a weekend. Pleasant and ocean view.
13658,1610842,4,Keiravan,26/09/2021,"It is true that there is noise because the entrance road to the port is right next to it, but otherwise fine. Clean water service and gray and black discharge. Half an hour walk to the center of Gijón. A lot of parked motorhome that looks like they belong to people from the city who are parked there"
13658,1605840,1,villapodencas,25/09/2021,"And because there are no less stars, it is impossible to sleep. incessant traffic and noise. If you intend to rest DO NOT come to this area. It doesn't make up for you to have the beach in front of you .. fatally, it falls short."
13658,1603422,3,happyflo,23/09/2021,"Area with few spaces, free emptying and filling services, we had to park outside the area next to the park, to spend one night is fine."
13658,1592442,3,domigranier,19/09/2021,"It is called area but just because it is equipped for the emptying of water and cassette but the places are cramped and scouatees it is forbidden to take out table, chairs and to put the chocks. Beach right next door. We neither have slept The people of the south"

13658,1563247,3,B564,09/09/2021,Good area to visit the city. We moved by bike. there is the bike path that starts here and you can go to many places.
13658,1555369,4,LaiaSerra,07/09/2021,AC good. Services ok. The only downside is the noise of trucks passing towards the port at 5am. There are many bus lines that take you downtown.
13658,1552144,2,lena9203,06/09/2021,"Few places for AC and it seems that they are people who have been there for a long time. You can park in the parking lot that comes often, but they are fair places with the neighbors' cars. It is close to the road and there is a lot of noise. The only good thing is that you are next to the beach and that you can empty the waters (black and gray). We left after emptying the waters to another parking lot"
13658,1548563,5,sanchez.mercado,05/09/2021,"Quiet, with the services for motorhome. free and comfortable: black, gray and drinkable. If there are no parking spaces, you can park in the parking lot without problem. Spectacular sunrise in the sea. Lines 4 and 6 leave you in the center in 10 minutes for € 1.25. Gas station next door to refuel or buy the basics. Swings on the beach for children."
13658,1543673,4,gersansi,03/09/2021,This is very good but few places for ACs ... I agree with colleagues who complain about traffic noise ...
13658,1539327,4,Siciliano,02/09/2021,"Great area with all free services. Few free places in summer because of the ""jetas"" who set their ""summer residence"" here without any control by the municipal authorities. Police lurking because of users who park outside the area occupying TWO spaces, which causes discomfort among the neighbors."
13658,1539066,2,luistxu,02/09/2021,Impossible to sleep due to the incessant traffic and noise. The center of Gijón 40 minutes walk
13658,1521964,2,cherobe,28/08/2021,An area of 10. Although lately to the noise of the trucks from 6 in the morning you have to add the bottles. Lots of party people making noise and with very little respect. It's a shame the authorities don't do anything.
13658,1521936,5,viajoluegoexisto,28/08/2021,"Perfect place to park and spend the night, it is necessary to indicate better the drinking water taps and cleaning water, it can create confusion, 15 minutes walk is the Salao pizzeria, people from the neighborhood and very good treatment. Obviously there is noise because the port is next door but we have slept well, it is next to the beach with a spectacular sunrise, finally, it has a whole walk of picnic tables"
13658,1515837,4,KeberlynFigueira,26/08/2021,"I think it is not a place to spend the night, although it can. There is a lot of traffic of cars and trucks, but to park, empty and fill waters, and visit Gijón, it is the perfect place."
13658,1511479,2,FlapiWaris,25/08/2021,Much noise due to the traffic of the trucks that pass at full speed towards the port. We arrived and there was no room (at least there was about 50 AC) we waited about 10 minutes until we saw one leave and we entered. We spent the night and left. The correct services. Away from the city center.

13658,1479529,4,MaraMim,19/08/2021,Perfect for emptying and filling. We stayed in the parking lot right next door (free) as the area was full. In the parking lot you can't hear the passing of trucks. There were more ACs and vans. No hassle with neighbors and perfect for sleeping. Glued to the beach. A 10 min walk there is laundry and super neighborhood.
13658,1478799,4,Channelchallenger,18/08/2021,"Perfect area next to the beach, with all services, the only bad thing is at the entrance to the port and trucks do not stop entering throughout the night, a lot of noise."
13658,1456805,1,mendezdoblado,14/08/2021,"To download and fill. There is a group of fixed motorhomes that were said to attract the attention of all new arrivals, boring people. And to sleep very noisy."
13658,1456505,3,HorseLuis,14/08/2021,The area is very good. Next to a beach and picnic area with tables and shade. The bad thing is that it is next to a roundabout.
13658,1444516,4,viajeros33,12/08/2021,Parking next to the Arbeyal beach and picnic area. There is a cafeteria next door with hours of 12-22h. It is about 30 minutes from the center of Gijón but it is very good walking. There is not much noise due to the passage of trucks towards the port but it can be solved with some plugs. The baker stops by at around 10:30 am and 12pm. It has a water change area. Thanks to the City Council. Gijón.
13658,1442738,3,itrece,12/08/2021,"To spend the day it is fine, quite quiet. It also has services (water, garbage ...). But to spend the night I do not recommend it, since all the cars and trucks on the road can be heard passing. If you like to walk, it is super good to park since the center of Gijón is about 35-40min walking."

In a walk you can visit the aquarium, railway museum ... Parking with AC, camper and cars, there are many parking lots at 2 points in the area. No noise at night. In the morning the baker passed by ♥ ️"

13658,1427264,1,snaveau,09/08/2021,Bad memory a car backed up on our motorhome when we were driving in the area and the other motorhome operators rude to us. We left as soon as the observation was completed.
13658,1420387,4,xemita,07/08/2021,"The AC parking lots were busy but we parked the ones next door and it was full of AC, the police pass by and they say nothing. Emptying and filling water can take a long time, as it is overcrowded. Next to the beach and with picnic tables."

I give this area a three because I have slept badly. The first night many trucks and motorcycles passed by, making a lot of noise, and on the second night almost no trucks passed. at most the area is 50m from the beach and 20min from the center"

13658,1399532,1,VictorW,03/08/2021,"The effort of the city council is appreciated but it is impossible to sleep there, trucks coming and going at all hours of the night, the good thing is that nearby there are supermarkets, banks, public laundry and a beach. I saw from the bus that near the football stadium there were more ACs parked, perhaps it is a better option to sleep."

Port entrance trucks don't bother that much. Baker whistled past at 11:30 with bread, croissants and prenaos. It is full, but outside the area, in the adjoining parking there is some room. In front of the beach"
13658,1373069,3,Jayla,28/07/2021,"Although the site is spectacular, beachfront, picnic area in the shade, I give it 3 stars for the atmosphere. We spent only one night, in the parking lots outside the area, impossible to find a place in the area, it is monopolized by fixed motorhomes. To sleep it is super noisy and people, young people, families and children can be in the picnic area until the wee hours, for 1 night no more."
13658,1355759,3,Antoniopurchil,23/07/2021,"Filling and emptying of water. Clean but very noisy. Mostly always occupied by the same apparently since even the butane truck will sell the bottles to the place because they know them, they have the area as if it were their private camping, even with a speaker with music outside to animate the meetings they do . Thanks to the City Council for putting up the area and I encourage you to control more."
13658,1343311,3,RaquelLa,20/07/2021,"Although as they say it is crowded, it is a perfect place to visit Gijón. We have spent 2 nights with 60 other caravans but without problems. Despite the large influx, the filling and emptying area is clean. The noise from the trucks is bearable. The baker stops by at 11 in the morning with bread, empanadas and croissants. Thanks to the city council for the facilities."
13658,1337523,2,borjasl,18/07/2021,"A crowded area with many ""installed"" motorhomes as well as very noisy at night because it is next to the roundabout at the entrance to the port. It is used to fill and empty while en route."
13658,1315618,3,torghi13,11/07/2021,"Lots of people, we can hardly park. We went on the night from Saturday to Sunday and the trucks were no problem sleeping. Lots of people wanting to change the waters, so the wait is long. On the plus side, it's free, it's next to the beach, and it has a shady picnic area that's great"
13658,1307407,2,Monica23888,09/07/2021,Very noisy truck traffic entering and leaving the port
13658,1300210,3,Pab6,06/07/2021,"Privileged area on the beachfront. The bad thing is the noise of the trucks entering the port very early. Also in the afternoon it is filled with ""fragonetas"""
13658,1282971,5,blimthepixie,28/06/2021,"The area for motorhomes is busy, we got lucky and found a space. The other car park is big enough for parking if full.

Water point and drainage. There are also toilets in the garage and also stand alone cubicles when lifeguards are on duty. 

Probably couldn't get a site closer to the beach.

Yes, it is noisy from port traffic but so what?"
13658,1279054,3,Tamasco,26/06/2021,"Area for 18 AC. As the previous comments say, packed. We caught the last site there was. Outside the Area, there were another 15 ACs, in the parking lot. With services. In the morning quite a lot of noise from the trailers."
13658,1274557,2,criscebral,24/06/2021,"The place is not ugly, since it has the beach attached, but very, very, very noisy. It is next to a roundabout and the access entrance to the trucks for the port."

13658,1266995,4,NuriaVeg,20/06/2021,We parked for a few hours. We found a place but there were enough AC and vans. There is a tap for filling water ... but for emptying I have not seen. Quite well located. Gratuitous
13658,1264870,4,franjgr,19/06/2021,"The area is fine, but the city council should consider a second area because it is full 300 of 365 days, thank goodness that in the parking lot where it is embedded there is usually no problem parking and the motorhomes expand outside the area. It is also due to the fact that the time that ACs spend in the area is not controlled and some use it as private parking. In the neighborhood restaurants and shops"
13658,1253885,4,vitormvc,13/06/2021,"Only place with services in Gijon, so it should be valued. Many motorhomes on site. Beautiful surroundings, with beach and cafes, but the location is not the best (far from the center)."
13658,1245636,4,Quicolas,09/06/2021,"Correct area attached to a regular beach. I sleep in the p del Molino and if so I will use their services. As in many other areas, the problem is the unsupportive clever who leave their ac all year round as if it were a garage and the cockroaches that don't even throw them out with dynamite. Anyway .... Motorhomes throwing stones at their own roof. Country....."

13658,1195331,2,lkwlkwlkw,13/05/2021,Such a strange vibe - right by a massive industrial port with loads of empty camper vans stored there as well as people who are clearly living there full time. We slept ok - after quite a lot of noise at around 1030/11 it quietened down. The surrounding area is a bit dead and we didn’t feel that comfortable leaving our van to explore. As a facilities stop to fill up and empty water fine. No toilets open but we bought some bread in the petrol station next door and there were some surprisingly nice toilets in there.
13658,1184171,4,MidlifeCrafted,03/05/2021,"Early May ‘21. Great location & easy flat walk to city center. Parking a mixture of vehicles in use / in storage, but plenty of ACs parked outside area with no issues."
13658,1164691,1,latecha,03/04/2021,"I wonder if the city council will charge the contribution to the community of neighbors who have their usual residence set up there and that on top of occupying a place, they make you feel annoying. A shame ... because the facilities and the location are first-rate ."
13658,1164654,1,Asturperson,03/04/2021,"A well located and well equipped area. The problem is the users who have their plot set up there ALL YEAR ROUND, who also believe they are the owners of the area. They have the best places and make you feel like you are annoying when you use some of the facilities in the area."
13658,1137813,1,HerbContri,15/02/2021,Wanted to stand there on 02/14/21 for a day and a night. Unfortunately parking space full of local campers / cars. No way. I am no longer coming to Gijon.
13658,1110002,3,Scilash66,31/10/2020,"I give 3 stars and not less right because it is the only space used for campers that there is. It is actually quite noisy for traffic. However, if nothing else, it overlooks the beach and you can take a pleasant stroll along the promenade. Easy services."
13658,1089159,3,newhome_newadventure,11/10/2020,"It's a shame that locals park there campervan there while they living in the city. Holding up place for the travelers, they should know it's hard to find place to sleep. 
And then there are long termers who seems to be staying there for weeks. 
The city should do something about that.!!
But you can park before the area if full, seems police dont mind that."
13658,1083774,3,rulandovoy,06/10/2020,"Perfect location, next to the beach and bike path to the city center. The only problem, at least in summer, is that there are tables where people gather to have a bottle and parties until late at night without any control, with music and even people singing and playing the guitar. On the other hand, nobody moves so that they do not take away the site. Long stays, not just 48 hours, a shame."
13658,1075890,4,faurys93,30/09/2020,"We did all the parking lots close to the city center (good at 1 or 2 km) and there is only this one where there was room. Close to the beach, we stare at you when you arrive but we relax pretty quickly :). On the other hand, super noisy to sleep there. Finally we just took the aperitif, you have to take a bus to a city center that is not of much interest."
13658,1068204,4,Lladonetta,24/09/2020,"Free area with filling and emptying service, apart from the reserved places, there are many more ac and campers and in principle it is allowed. Something noisy to stay overnight if you are picky."
13658,1068100,2,AliciaCamacho,24/09/2020,"Lots of noisy trucks, people singing from the bottle. Overnight there but we didn't use anything else we left"
13658,1067381,2,Rossemary,24/09/2020,"Although it is an area with parking, filling and emptying and on the beach, there should be more control since there are at least more than 10 motorhomes living there with their mounted beach bars, drains, etc., depriving the rest of being able to enjoy it, so we do not feel comfortable and off we went. I hope that Gijón controls that."
13658,1065962,5,Dinamita,23/09/2020,"An area very well located on a beach promenade with benches and tables with all services, a lot of motorhomes, if it is full there is a car park where you park and apparently they do not say anything, the only bad thing is that there are people who do not know move from there for a long time"
13658,1063645,3,guiomar,22/09/2020,"Thanks to the most excellent city council of Gijón for this area with everything free to visit the city. It is taken by unpresentable people who do not move in months, they even have fixed pipes to the drain -generators-clotheslines and a violent attitude if you tell them the police will come."
13658,1063347,3,yoleirtap21,22/09/2020,"Area enabled to unload gray and black, with 2 taps ... It is not the most recommended in Gijón to spend the night because there is a lot of traffic in the port area, cars and motorcycles modified to make more noise."

13658,1044430,3,garrucha,12/09/2020,"A great area, I liked it a lot, the only thing I don't like is that there are many people who stay there all summer, and they don't give other people a choice ... I would like the City Council to do something about it. That at least the motorhomes that are there days and days and days will be watched a little more, and no one tells them anything. I would like to go back, if things change a little ..."

13658,1026981,1,Correomaverick,05/09/2020,"Well signposted motorhome area with emptying or water services. The beach next door. Walk downtown about ten minutes. The problem is the noise at night since it is next to the entrance of the port with the passage of trucks, cars and some make bottles there. It is better to go to the Rinconin area."
13658,1026086,2,travelwithdogs21,04/09/2020,"Area to empty and continue. Noise night. Cars cornering at high speed. Braking. Botellon. It is not worth staying. Bad condition, well defined squares for saying something positive. Beach next door! Good ride."

13658,999848,2,ViajarEnRuta,24/08/2020,"2 stars for the proximity of the beach and the service from the Gijón City Council, but it is a shame for the motorhome that the farmhouse is unruly, which has been set up by a few who stay most of the year and literally believe they are the owners, while waiting One came to the water area with his carafe and when we told him that we were there, he told us that ""he was at his house"""
13658,997058,5,Fusti,24/08/2020,"Perfect place to relax and let the world flow as usual. The area has 18 spaces and more than 50 normal parking spaces where, respecting the lines, you can park. large clean beach. you can enjoy it without complaining."
13658,990002,1,CR1516,22/08/2020,"The negative of the area, difficult to take a place because there are some who do not move throughout the summer. Bad smell. Noise all the time from the trucks that go to the port, young people with bottles until 8 a.m. The police pass by and do not nothing with the young people of the bottle who urinate in the street, they throw chairs of the nearby burger. The only positive is its proximity to the beach, this place is getting worse and worse"
13658,985303,2,Didiruca06,20/08/2020,"It was like the square ..... Crowded. Full and impossible to park, in fact I appreciate it because to sleep there it has to be hard with the traffic of trucks. The good the beach right next to it."

13658,964488,1,Toyotomi,15/08/2020,"If you are going to empty or to the beach, it is worth it. To sleep is hell. The traffic of trucks and trains is unbearable, young people without education can choose the park behind as a party area and you will have to accompany them until 4:00 am"

13658,952030,1,kikuromera,11/08/2020,Area to park and spend the night but very difficult to find a place. To empty water (gray and black) is a bit chaotic because of the queues and wait.
13658,950421,1,aimargeneration150,11/08/2020,The area is very very well Two problems The noise of the trucks that go to the port And those that pass anchored to the plot all the time occupying the site to fill and empty the waters It is a shame that the municipalities are all the day for there and they do not have a way of looking that they are not always the same
13658,947607,2,willvy,10/08/2020,"The place is idyllic, with the beach behind and completely level. We have the problem in the area, or rather the motorhomes that remain in the places established for everyone throughout the summer. If someone in charge reads these lines, they should learn from León with limited parking time. A real shame."
13658,945729,2,RobertoGaDo,10/08/2020,"Positive: you have a beach next to it and a small promenade with tables, it is also 20 minutes from the center. Negative: it is not a place to spend the night if you want to rest, you have an avenue 2 meters away where many trucks pass as the port is next door and from 6 in the morning there is a lot of noise."
13658,938696,3,Caduki76,08/08/2020,"We were very lucky to get a place. It is true that there are users who spend the night more than what is allowed and who load water through carafes so as not to lose the site. The beach is next door, ideal for taking a refreshing swim. The taxi to the center about € 7. In the annexed area, even if it is not a specific motorhome area, parking is allowed, I understand that there are no problems to spend a night there."
13658,937416,2,Monicabc,07/08/2020,You can refill water and empty but nothing more. The entire parking lot is full and on top of that they look at you badly. It smells really bad. I don't recommend going there.

13658,930129,5,EOI,04/08/2020,"Thanks to the Gijón city council for the area, now they only need to regulate the parking time. There are uncivilized Motorhomers who think that it is a campsite and the plot is theirs, then we cry because they take it away from us for abusing it. It has been impossible for me to park in the four days I have been in Gijón. There is a group that is always the same."

13658,885723,1,sunlita,21/07/2020,Very clever !!! they do not move the AC to empty or fill .. lest they take away their place ... they fill with jugs and empty .. in the same place where they are parked .. you warn them and they look at you badly .. Shame !! then we complain that we are forbidden to park in the places .. The area is fine .. a lot of noise the only thing !!
13658,866310,4,Zaydaren,13/07/2020,"Great area. Next to the beach. Far from the center. Noisy at night due to port truck traffic. The area itself is not very big, but they don't fault leaving the AC in the parking next door. The downside I see is that it seems that the people who are in the area are constantly, they do not move to empty the grays or to fill water, they do it in buckets, lest they take away their place. Yesterday and today to the fullest. It is noted that the province of Lugo is closed."
13658,786885,2,vanlife1987,26/02/2020,"Good location in terms of views, you are attached to the beach. It is an acceptable area to change the waters, but it has many negative aspects; It is a little far from the center, a very noisy place to sleep, trucks do not stop entering the port, rude sweepers at dawn, talking as if nothing, without considering that we slept there. It is only recommended for one night and considering these details. Luck..."
13658,786817,2,claisius,26/02/2020,"To stop and visit Gijón is acceptable, close to the beach but very far from the center, about 40 minutes walk along the promenade. The bad thing is to sleep, it is impossible to sleep through the night, the entrance to the pier is right at the door and trucks do not stop and to top it off at 06:30 in the morning the tractor and cleaning equipment passed and it was impossible sleep."
13658,785638,2,ktm4tiempos,24/02/2020,"A lot of truck noise, and those of the cleaning with an education of 1%, at 1:00 the garbage truck that seems to fall the world and at 6:30 the sweeper making more noise than a factory, it seems that They do it intentionally. Otherwise everything very well."

13658,767094,4,Letitaco,10/01/2020,"Good area to spend a couple of nights, approximately 20 minutes walk from the center. With services of both waters. For me, the only downside is the traffic noise because it is attached to a roundabout that overlooks the port. There are comments on the squares, they are sufficiently wide and long of 6m approx (the previous lines of the size of the squares are still painted than if they were too narrow)."

Quite big, with many places and if there are now more places to stay, you can park near this aire in the parking area, and the police do not tell us anything. For the noise, a bit noisy, because it is near the port area, but during the night it becomes silent. Nice surrounding, the aire is located near the beach. Good connection with the center of Gijon, because within 5 mins walk there is a bus stop, which takes you directly to the city center. Safe, as the police is patrolling often."
13658,721407,1,Bennys_tour2019,14/10/2019,"We spent there a night and it was impossible to fall asleep because of all the noise. Also, it is quite far to the city centre and the next day, we were chased away by another camper who thought we parked wrong as our camper van is not a traditional van and therefore can be mistaken as a small truck. He could have asked friendly before being so rude to us."

Free filling and emptying site, facing the beach, with shade, snacks ... what more could you ask for in an area? It's August and it's scandal. If you are a light sleeper, you will hear cars and trucks. But ..... you don't know. Walk to the center in 30-40 minutes. If you are not used to walking, you take the bus at CEPSA."
13658,657343,3,silval,24/08/2019,"Being August, it was a coincidence to find a place, although it was not one of AC's that are always full. We would be about 50 GV motorhomes, mostly in car seats.

Also from early morning the traffic of trucks and workers that go to the port is continuous. It has picnic tables next to it that could be ideal but the wind usually blows a lot. Good to spend a night but not to rest."

It's 1:30 a.m., we had a garbage truck at 11:30 p.m., a dozen huge trucks heading to the port, runs of tuned cars, mopeds, packs of dogs that people let bark on the beach, at the moment and for 2 hours, loud techno music. Its only advantage is that it's free, because it really sucks."

13658,31172,3,AnderLG,15/02/2015,Good area near the port security booth and next to the beach. Nearby there is also a gas station and bus stop. The bad thing is that it is a little far from the historic center and a lot of truck traffic for people who have problems with noise while sleeping.

They ask to pay 0.30 cents but when it doesn't work the machine accepts any card even if it is from the doctor. If we went back to Gijón we would repeat for sure. Easy to find parking for cars and vans, more difficult for motorhomes."
13662,3026492,5,p_villares,26/07/2023,"Difficult to find a place in July, if anything first thing in the morning, I don't understand why the campers don't park in the car spaces, if they fit perfectly, so more motorhomes would fit. To go to the center of Gijon it is a bit far away, but if you have a dog the beach for them is right next door and in the huge park they can also run loose."
13662,2993541,4,andrewfranki,20/07/2023,"Super crowded. They park all kinds of vehicles, it is true that finding parking is not easy but it is super well located. Right in front is the Olaya for dogs, El Rinconin. It has no services but you know that you will be in a quiet parked place."

You also have a stop right there that with lines 14 and 25 leave you in the center for 1.5e. It is a busy place, we arrived in the middle of the afternoon and we were lucky. As a colleague says, there are some cars that seem to live there. A community where everyone knows each other and has a bit of a romp."

It would not be bad to regulate a maximum stay even if we had to pay something. If it is already difficult to travel in summer with dogs, in Asturias more so with so many prohibitions and few options."

The parking lot is quiet and during the night it is a pleasure, because we have not heard any noise or disturbance. It is located a few meters from the coast and promenade. In the morning the baker has passed, he sells bread, a variety of buns and sweets as well as coffee. Without a doubt, a great place next to Gijón that we will repeat."

13662,2409813,4,Bennoh,28/09/2022,"Great place, mostly flat areas, right on the promenade into town...which by the way is definitely worth a visit. Regular police pateouille .. and the baker still comes every morning at the end of September."
13662,2398244,4,Tittiflitzer,24/09/2022,"Good parking for a night or two! There are many mobile homes here, but you can definitely still find space (at least in the off-season). From 8:30 a.m. the baker comes and honks his horn at regular intervals for an hour, so nothing for late risers. Quick way into town via the promenade."
13662,2395317,3,jlacacho,22/09/2022,"The place is really very good, painted plots for motorhomes and another area for cars. Next to a magnificent park and with a walk to the city... So far so good, if it weren't for the fact that people must use it to ""park their vans and cars"". Cars that park in car zones throw a mattress and take out tables and chairs and chat until the wee hours. Ultimately, disrespect."
13662,2395077,5,jesushinojo,22/09/2022,"We slept one night with no problems. Many AC and campers, although it is seen that some were parked. It is away from the city but it is right next to the boardwalk and there is a very large park. The baker passes. Recommendable!!"
13662,2382458,4,Meli710,18/09/2022,"We have arrived at night (about 11 p.m. approx) and we have found a place to park the first time. It is very good to spend the night and we have felt safe. Of course, there are no bathrooms or showers so it is only ideal for spending the night. It is a very calm and quiet place. We loved it but if it had bathrooms it would be ideal. It is true that there is a small booth where it indicated that there was something but they were closed (hence my score)."
13662,2364763,3,javyalonso,12/09/2022,"Full parking lot and, for a change in this location, small cars parked in the big holes that I don't know if they really are for ACs and the like or can park there. The bad thing is that people tend to camp in this place, with chairs, hanging clothes, etc... We'll be sorry later."

Unfortunately, the toilet didn't work, the adjacent park is beautiful and so is the dog beach, there are also showers. There is a lot going on here even at night as the street is right next to it"
13662,2336428,3,dynk,03/09/2022,"The parking, the nearby park and the dog beach are quite good, we ran out of space for some vehicles in the MOTORHOMES, then they fined us..."
13662,2307531,4,tash389,27/08/2022,"The public carpark has been taken over by motorhomes, there are restrictions signs up for parking on 29th Aug. Level ground, the angled spaces big enough for 7.7m. Bread man drives around with pastries etc. easy walk to town, down through park turn left along the promenade and you are on the bay. Excellent sleep. No grey/black waste"
13662,2299876,5,AliciaBR,25/08/2022,"Good parking to spend the night. Very quiet and close to the beach promenade, and to a park. The baker passes from 8 am every hour. If you ask for a taxi, to go to the center of Gijón it costs around €7. It is worth stopping here instead of the car parks closest to Paseo de San Lorenzo, where you also pay €6, but there is a lot of noise from cars"
13662,2294401,3,acampostru,24/08/2022,"This time bad, it was all full there was no way to park, of course it was the big week and all of Gijon was overflowing, however other times we have been and it was perfect, quiet, near the water, the walks."
13662,2293861,3,annaubdfloundbob,24/08/2022,Is okay. The park is very nice and so far it is quiet and you stand comfortably straight. The nearest supermarket is about 10 minutes away on foot. There is a dog beach and other small bays. We stayed here for one night because unfortunately the beaches cannot be used as surf spots. Our Fiat Ducato was parked in a normal car space. The WoMo places are all full.
13662,2292386,2,Viajerohappy,23/08/2022,"Little space there is no way to get a place in this area. No services. The day that the municipalities realize what they lose, things will change"
13662,2267486,4,Parody,19/08/2022,"Busy car park with entrances and exits during the day, beware of perrears, it is very close to the beach for dogs and a huge park. I would repeat"
13662,2266768,1,Surfreak,19/08/2022,The terror of the parking lot… the baker!!!
13662,2251425,5,palomita,16/08/2022,"A fantastic place to spend the night, although in recent years we have seen that it is almost more and more crowded. The baker passed by at 8.40 am"
13662,2249513,3,Gregorianski2,16/08/2022,"The location and the parking are great. Unfortunately, it is really difficult to find a spot. Some of the RVs seem to be there the whole summer."
13662,2247975,5,coco0742,16/08/2022,"A great place to sleep. The spot is 25 minutes walk from the city center, it is an ideal location. However, the car park is very often full, you have to be lucky to find a place. Please pay attention to vehicles when you open the doors because you are not alone!!"
13662,2240101,4,Mic_past,15/08/2022,"Very difficult to find parking (arrived at 17, we had to wait for cars to leave). Quiet night and many campers in the area. I recommend it only for a one night visit of Gijon"
13662,2237857,4,SoraiaTeles,14/08/2022,"Nice place, however impossible to find a free spot when we traveled in August. It seems a calm area, with many campervans, green space and a super nice playground. Not too close but not too far either from the centre (maybe a 20/25 minutes walk)."
13662,2235271,4,jbverger,14/08/2022,"Incredible parking, I was there on August 7, only a little full for my taste, only Vans and CCs, Good atmosphere reigning, a little party between campers but nothing really disturbing, Beach for dogs at the end of the landscaped park bordering the car park, ideal for animals in this case. Landscaped park also super pleasant on a sunny afternoon. 15 minutes from the center on foot"
13662,2226182,4,destinocatorce,12/08/2022,We spent 2 nights here. It has seemed to us an ideal place to be with our dogs with a park and beach for them Right next door. The baker who drops by in the mornings is a great extra. The only drawback is that being a car park you have to be very careful with dogs because sometimes cars go by very quickly. It is difficult to find a place at least at this time. We will surely repeat here.

13662,2071150,3,Slimsteve989,14/07/2022,"The parking lot is always busy. Many campers did not get a place because everything was full. If you parked incorrectly, you got a ticket from the police.

13662,2033771,3,gilda2015,03/07/2022,A very nice parking space if it weren't for the fact that there are uncivil colleagues who use the park to leave the cars closed for months without caring about the rest that we want to go spend two days. Let's see if they put a 72-hour signal so that people move their asses and we can all enjoy it.
13662,1906378,4,LaBichaneta,22/05/2022,"Easily accessible site, without services but quiet, close to a beach for dogs, a promenade and a park with a children's area. Standard size and larger seats for AC and GV. It is a pity that the latter are often occupied by other van ""partners"" with small vans that would comfortably fit the standard seats, but need to occupy the space of the large ones."
13662,1904632,5,odonotim,21/05/2022,"Top spot, felt very safe, loads of other vans, noticed regular police patrol too. Local baker will wake you with his van of fresh baked goods in the morning, which is a plus and a minus :) Public toilet nearby seems shut but there are others on boardwalk.

13662,1255262,5,Beniat40,14/06/2021,Good place with a lot of CC but great to spend the night with a big green space next to it and a great walk to do along the cliffs. There are also two other places further on and especially at the mirador with a magnificent view.

Right in front of the promenade that takes you to the center of Gijón in 30 'walking or 10' by bike along the bike path. The truth is that we were even sad to leave, we were very good, the best option to spend the night in Gijón."
13662,1063343,4,yoleirtap21,22/09/2020,"The best place to spend the night in Gijón since it is very quiet, a bit uneven ... It does not have water services or drainage."
13662,1049594,5,CristianLM,15/09/2020,"We loved the place, very close to Gijón, very quiet, a bathroom close by, the park where the parking is located is great. You have a beach that you walk to. Passed the baker in the morning :-)"

Free. As it should be a forbidden parking area to take any item outside !! Thanks Gijón !!!!"
13662,1026991,2,Correomaverick,05/09/2020,Well defined area. It does not have discharge and water services. Pay baths and beaches next door. To the center about 20 minutes walk along a beautiful walk. Very quiet to sleep and rest.
13662,996671,5,TrikilyVan,23/08/2020,Spectacular site. There are places for AC and for different vans. (if they respect them). Payment WC (€ 0.30). Large green area where you can take tables and chairs. One of the best I've been to.
13662,992926,5,jamis1.0,22/08/2020,"Very good place to spend a few days. Large, signposted and level squares. Located at the end of the promenade. Walking along this walk you get to the center in about 30 minutes. It does not have a water drainage area."
13662,972812,2,Sheali,17/08/2020,The toilets are chargeable and swallowed my 30 cents without opening. Special card required. Parking close to a rather noisy busy road. No baker seen in the morning ... we are in a van and this spot seems more suitable for motorhomes.
13662,971943,5,aina91,16/08/2020,"Good site, large squares, quiet area. The walk to the city is very beautiful."

13662,951558,4,chanobas,11/08/2020,"The site is very good but it is difficult to find a place. Next to the sea, beautiful views, next to the promenade. While we were waiting to get a place, an AC arrived and parked in the place (large, AC) that was keeping a car for him. A pity that they act like this."

13662,939212,4,RubenRubio,08/08/2020,Large parking for the night. Next to a large park and a 15-minute walk along the coast from the city center. We arrived mid afternoon and it was almost full. At the last minute a lot of people came but there was no longer room. Public toilets opposite. We had a very good night. Recommendable!
13662,930738,5,TatiV,05/08/2020,A perfect car park to spend a couple of nights if you are supplied. There are no water services but the place is worth it. The park is spectacular. Highly recommended. The problem is getting a place. We were lucky.
13662,930251,4,Deivy81,05/08/2020,"Like Parking, very good place. It does not have any service and the delimited sites are not respected too much, it would be good that in large spaces they only park here and in small cars and van"
13662,928641,4,juntxu,04/08/2020,"The only drawback is that the center of Gijón is far to walk, otherwise it is very good. if you go with a dog you have a beach right next to it"
13662,924907,4,Satanaky,03/08/2020,"It is a very quiet place. falls asleep cool. It has a public toilet that is very clean and you pay by card.

13662,918266,3,flosticks,01/08/2020,"The place is cool if you want to go with your dog to the beach. In addition, the center is a short walk away (20-25 min) ... but in summer it is a bit overwhelming if you are not lucky enough to get a motorhome pitch: the others are very narrow and it is full ... it is a bit claustrophobic."
13662,918199,5,Xabiexpert,01/08/2020,"Very good place to spend a few days and discover Gijon, the bath 30 cents with a card and the winged dog beach. The center 15 or 20 min walk. 100% recommended."

13662,863019,5,kylifurgo,12/07/2020,"A great place to spend the night many vans and AC that gives those of us who started a little more security ... The bathroom in the parking lot very well.

13662,747889,4,samvick,28/11/2019,"Large parking lot occupied by a lot of other motorhomes. 2 quiet nights for us. Very nice walk by the sea to go to town otherwise there is the bus right next to it. ""Camping"" stop. Small blow of mouth on the other hand after having seen one of the CC emptying its tank of gray water on the ground ... It is because of people like that that CC are frowned upon!"

13662,690879,3,RC1003,14/09/2019,"Free. It is a parking designed for cars, so the plots are short for 7 meters. Away from the center, pass the baker. In spite of everything, you can go."

13662,681377,5,max8xam,08/09/2019,"The public toilet they comment works and is a pass. If you use any card you can use it for free, whatever it is. The area in general is very good."
13662,677537,4,laurea,05/09/2019,"Perfect for pecnotar, you have to wait for some free space, but in the afternoon a car always runs. Quiet, surrounded by green area and a few meters from a beach suitable for dogs. Well leveled, but without services. There are no services for motorhomes, there is a service at the entrance but it is usually closed."

The toilets can be accessed with any metallic-stripped card, no payment needed.
Lovely!"

13662,655592,4,katedave,24/08/2019,Fantastic location. great next to park and beach for dogs to run free. only downside it was a bit noisy with people talking and shouting to each other at night from other cars and mobilehomes in the carpark. perfect apart from that.
13662,654695,5,Franlopezricarte,23/08/2019,Perfect place to stop and spend the night
13662,648768,5,Furgolden,21/08/2019,"Perfect also if you go with dogs, a few meters from the canine beach and in front of a park where you can go loose! With the Reby app you can rent an electric scooter (there are all over the city) and move along the bike path."

13662,643293,4,zurix,19/08/2019,"Settlement of vans and AC although there is also a car. Next to a large park, the promenade and beach suitable for dogs. The baker's passage between 9 and 10 is priceless but in addition telepizza also serves the parking lot. If it were filled and emptied it would be the most. Overnight calm."
13662,639023,4,pacasu,18/08/2019,"Level parking, next to the beach, with toilets (to use them you have to pass something metallic through the card slot}, near the center, bus stop next door, very quiet and with many motorhomes, although we find a place without problem. The baker comes at 9 am;)"
13662,626485,3,JoyceS,14/08/2019,"Very busy, a lot of campers and cars coming and going. Noisy until midnight along with the barking from many dogs. But the rest of the night very silent. Behind the parking lot is a huge park with ocean views. Toilet is a self cleaning booth, open 24/7. This is for 1 night when passing through. It's much smaller than what it looks like on the pictures, with a larger camper it's quite a challenge."
13662,587404,3,aliciayjavier,31/07/2019,"Very good place to park and sleep. Lots of AC and parked vans and no noise. Without bathrooms At 9:30 a.m. the baker passes with a van full of buns, bread and empanadas. It is 20-30 minutes from the center of Gijón. On the promenade there is a Crosffit Box of a very very nice boy, if you have the opportunity go to train."

13662,578928,4,loupale,27/07/2019,Friendly parking right by the sea and a park. Unobstructed view of the ocean. A local baker spends around 9:00 and offers breads and pastries. Quiet night without much noise. Place a little small But it is a parking lot originally to respect If we do not want to be restricted by the municipality
13662,578410,4,leeloo95,27/07/2019,Quiet parking. The night went well. No services but the baker spends the morning around 9am with bread and pastries. Parking is shared with cars but there is more CC to recommend.
13662,571438,5,mlindaanne,23/07/2019,"Nice parking, shared with cars. Easy walk to the town. Because the parking spaces are marked for cars, they are a little small, so most people use a little more than one. Very quiet during the night."

13662,564153,5,flashontheroad,20/07/2019,"It is a crowded but quiet place to be a city, there are many Furgos and ACS, but it is worth it, you have the city for a walk along the promenade and a large park just below. For those of us who go with a dog, the canine beach is one step away."
13662,560390,4,ben33,18/07/2019,Good spot to visit Gijón. Downtown 3 km we did it with children from the car park to the aquarium and then visited the city and no problem. So go ahead !!!!

13662,552185,5,estei33,13/07/2019,"To visit Gijon is great, 3km from the center by the pass. Relatively quiet environment to be in town with park, bike path. Closest range allowed to dogs so a horror when you do not have one. Go instead on the left beach at 100m.ideal for - 7m DC. A lot of people last night. Baker who passed at 9:30. Awesome."
13662,549718,3,nicola33,12/07/2019,"Convenient parking, cycle path leading to the center. attention spaces are suitable for cars. We with the 5 meter camper have occupied only one parking lot (as it would be correct and legal to do) instead dozens of other campers have positioned their 7 meters occupying at least 2 spaces .. And this is not correct. It would be a parking lot for van / small vehicles, not for everyone. They will certainly forbid it .."
13662,546455,5,elenanus,10/07/2019,The place is great! Quiet and sooo wide. Surrounded by green areas with playgrounds and areas to walk the dog. Promenade at 1min and the beach in front is suitable to go with dogs. A marvel!

13662,492359,4,carogue,25/05/2019,"Nice place to spend 1 or 2 days maximum because no service. Too bad because the area is nice with this large park and the proximity of the sea, beaches and the city (3 km anyway) but the ride to go along the sea is too nice. Tranquility of the night and baker in the morning around 9am."

Great to have toilets with toilet paper BUT the showers had no curtains or anywhere to hang stuff so we didn't use them. Also we couldn't work out where the black water drain was(in the grey water drain??) & the 2 taps weren't labelled so we didn't know which was for rinsing/filling - so we only used the grey water drainage.
Nice small town to visit."

13715,2019914,5,blackbella,28/06/2022,"Best camper place I've visited so far. It's free! With showers, hot water, which also costs nothing. It was clean! And if you find it dirty, just take the cleaning rag yourself or go to a campsite with a cleaning lady! Beautiful park area. Nice people. Small kiosk. dog friendly I stay two nights. Was actually only planned for one."
13715,1998553,2,Pusina_2000,21/06/2022,A very nice setting but very very dirty toilets and showers. In more than 24 hours that we were there they were not cleaned

13715,1918883,5,miblanes,26/05/2022,"AC area in a beautiful setting, next to the river park of Ágreda. The town 10 minutes through a grove. It has a hose to fill the water tank. The truth is great, I recommend 100%"
13715,1907123,4,Monoboo,22/05/2022,"Great place to spend the night or stop for lunch in the wooded area with picnic tables. There are tables, shade and a water fountain, as well as an electric car charging area. The bathrooms seemed closed to lock and key. 15 minutes walk from the town. Thank you Ágreda for this place."
13715,1898589,4,NunilaM,18/05/2022,"To be free, the place is super cool, it had bathrooms and a kiosk but they were closed when we were there. Very clean area, with swings, a small stream and tables to eat. It has no light."

13715,1770284,5,jcastellp,01/03/2022,Very good area near the village. We had a very quiet night. Access with Tomtom takes you to a gate that is closed. With Waze you get along well. Squares with some unevenness that is solved by wedges.
13715,1761372,4,CrazyLau,20/02/2022,"The place is great, many places to park between trees, or without trees. Quiet and fairly level place. A pity that the tap for the water to fill/clean potty does not have the drive handle, so there is no water. Black's drain is clogged, so we haven't been able to use it. The bathrooms were closed."

13715,1741595,3,Anniedidier,26/01/2022,"Stop, but we will not spend the night there. Too limited to drain, trees, branches and gates, 7.5 m motorhome Beautiful park, quiet, too bad."
13715,1741102,1,antonioip,25/01/2022,"The setting is beautiful, but for 7.5m motorhomes it is very difficult to access the loading and unloading area. A pity, since they have plenty of space to have located the service area in an accessible way. The signage is a mess, just a small plaque, looking in only one direction out of the 4 possible directions to access the area."
13715,1728872,5,boni78,07/01/2022,ideal place to spend the night. very quiet area with barbecues and parks for children.

13715,1577043,5,Perricamper,14/09/2021,"We liked the area, of which we have visited it is the best in the area. The bad are the bathrooms, which cannot be used when the bar is closed. During the day many people from the city go to do activities in the vicinity, so they are constantly passing by."
13715,1576335,4,ongarri,14/09/2021,"We slept on Saturday the 11th, quite full, but very quiet. Some mosquitoes, normal in summer, but luxurious. Very good site"

13715,1546523,5,MGRL,04/09/2021,"Quite open site. Surprisingly careful. Likewise, people from the town with cars and others, but it is quite quiet. Pretty shade. Except for the emptying of waters, we have not used any other service. All sooo correct."
13715,1536928,5,MarcosAina,01/09/2021,"Great area, with grass and shadows. Very nice place."
13715,1536719,5,NievesRG,01/09/2021,"Great area, it is very well equipped and the place is very nice and quiet. the only thing to be aware of at night the mosquitoes, since a stream passes and there is a lot of trees. Lots of shade and green."
13715,1518768,5,familitortatomi,27/08/2021,"After a few years without stopping, we are once again surprised by how well cared for the area is, a 10 for this council !!!"
13715,1501976,4,josecarmen,23/08/2021,"A very complete area. The bar (at least on Monday) opens at 4pm and as a consequence the toilet and shower services are closed until it opens. Otherwise a very nice and quiet place. As a suggestion for improvement, it would be to put a pipican since there is a lot of well-kept green land. And that the bar also opened in the morning."
13715,1501331,4,Scrud,23/08/2021,"We spent the night of the 20 and a beautiful and pleasant place. The only downside is that while the bar is closed, the services are also closed, so we couldn't make use of them. Otherwise a 10 to the town hall, we will surely repeat"
13715,1498529,5,Ana1304,22/08/2021,"Shady area, cool place in summer. The environment is very nice. The town is reached by a beautiful walk full of trees. Ágreda has an interesting urban area to visit."
13715,1498441,4,oceeme,22/08/2021,"It is a 5 star area for the space, the grass, the gray and black emptying, and filled with drinking water, all free, the toilets and hot showers (while the bar is open) ... BUT ... the people He occupies the spaces he wants, even cars, he uses the water to wash his bikes, he does not try to clean his tracks after his showers ... He gives us something for free and we only know how to be rude."
13715,1498325,3,MartiPortell,22/08/2021,"A fantastic environment, an initiative to thank the city council. There are some points we would like to comment on: -There is no specific place to empty sewage, and we think it is very easy to install and much more hygienic -To date the bar has closed at 11 pm and has opened at 11 in the morning, while the bar is closed the services and the showers are also For the rest, recommended place to stop."
13715,1470822,5,MiguelyOlga,17/08/2021,"After spending two nights here, we can only congratulate the Ágreda town council for this beautiful area where the stay and services (all free) are incredible, pdt: other town councils could follow an example since with these complexes we also contribute to prosperity of neighboring businesses. Fins aviat Ágreda"
13715,1464940,5,Anamo8,16/08/2021,"Very very good, very quiet area, large grassy meadow, shadows from many tall trees. The only thing that can be annoying are the dogs in a nearby factory, I don't know if the poor are in good condition, they don't stop barking."
13715,1458039,4,FuenteCamacho,14/08/2021,"One of the best areas we have seen. I do not give it a 5 because the filling-emptying area can be greatly improved, since if there are several ACs waiting they cut off the access path."
13715,1452703,4,joaquinlasierra,13/08/2021,Good area on a tree-lined walk with grass floor. Stagnant waters that favor mosquitoes. Very nice environment. We spent the night and we will surely return if we stop by. Thanks to the Agreda City Council

13715,1392994,5,AndamosMochileando,02/08/2021,"We stopped to have lunch and spend some time. A very nice place with lots of space and shade! We did not test the services. We saw some guys pitching a tent right next to the emptying area, so we understand that asking for permission is allowed"

13715,1389033,5,camera.en.route,01/08/2021,"This place deserves full points! Just outside the city, in the middle of nature, it resembles a park. I'll definitely come back to explore the surrounding region."
13715,1384343,5,FJOB,31/07/2021,Good area in a green area. Beautiful walk to town that disappointed me a little. The GPS sent us to another place. To enter you can go to the Repsol gas station and follow the signs or closer from the industrial estate there is a short dirt road

13715,1365451,5,comyola,26/07/2021,"Awesome. I cannot leave the only comment in French without reacting. If he had difficulty parking that doesn't make it a bad site.

13715,1364851,5,ChusR,25/07/2021,"The area is great! hot water, showers, toilets, gray water, grassy area, near the town The only thing is that on both nights that we were, around 2 or 3 in the morning, a couple of cars passed honking in front of the motorhomes ... it is known that there is not much leisure that people in cars were interested in, despite the fact that on a nearby terrace they had several events"
13715,1336976,5,Stromberg,18/07/2021,Excellent area with good views and a lot of tranquility. Walk of about 10 minutes to the town. Thanks to the people of Ágreda for this area.
13715,1336535,5,OniKirinaru,18/07/2021,"A rare concept. It is a municipal park where they park motorhomes. All day the inhabitants go for walks up and down. At a quiet night, except for some reggaeton music that passes by, but dark as a wolf's mouth. Otherwise great, the unloading area a bit maneuverable but the City Council's effort to provide us with resting places is commendable. Terrific bar guys"

13715,1325760,4,LuisaReina,15/07/2021,"Thanks to the city council of Agreda for this very welcoming area. The only thing to improve would be the entrance and exit of the water evacuation area, which for large motorhomes is a bit complicated, otherwise it is great, in a very beautiful environment"
13715,1304941,5,cascareva,08/07/2021,"A spectacular station: beautiful, clean, spacious and with all the services, including hot showers, which is not very common. The town with shops nearby and routes through the bike and walk area. Very happy!! Thanks to the city council."
13715,1303206,4,HooLee,07/07/2021,"If I had electricity it would already be a 5 *. A beautiful and quiet place, 10 'walk from the center. Level squares."
13715,1300677,4,carlosll,06/07/2021,"Excellent site, lots of shade, it feels safe, easy to get to. Perhaps for motorhomes of more than 6 meters access to the gray water drainage area will be complicated a little, but without a problem anyway."
13715,1300267,4,Criss.jake,06/07/2021,"It is a pleasant and well-kept lawn parking lot. As cons, the dogs cannot be loose, it is quite popular and at night disco music is heard until the early hours of the morning. In addition, you have to be careful and stay away from the spotlights in the bathroom and the cafeteria because they dazzle all night. Otherwise, it has a park and services."
13715,1299844,5,Lusalo,05/07/2021,"Without words and unbeatable, that all this is free, I hope the greed of the user does not spoil the area, thanks Ágreda."

13715,1277962,5,LALOBAAKIRA,26/06/2021,"Good area. Lots of shade. They told us that you can take out tables, chairs, awning. Respecting the environment. It is forbidden to throw garbage in the bins, they have put up posters. Some continue to do it, there is a container for it. CAUTION The navigator took us through the old town, VERY narrow streets, we were not miraculously embedded. Another better and short entrance through Siemens Gamesa, roundabout and the area next to it."

In our opinion, a very attractive place with good shade.
Space for black and gray, with drinking water taps.
Just a 15-minute walk from the beautiful city of Agreda
with excellent bars and restaurants.
The building with public toilet and shower was closed, we assume
it is due to Convid 19 issues and will reopen when this issue subsides.
We will, without dubts, come back."
13715,765414,1,Mardano,06/01/2020,It was a spectacular area but it has been renovated and now it is impossible to park. They have raised the floor of the road and dug some very deep ditches on both sides as a gutter that make it impossible to park by literally destroying the underside of the vehicle. I hope the City Council realizes the error and remedies it as soon as possible.

13715,728008,3,Bulli_Camper,23/10/2019,Simple parking space without additional services in a park. Environment not as nice as it looks in the photos and a little hard to find. For an overnight stay but ok.

Careless, the bathrooms and the dirty showers a pity, because the park is well structured. It has drinking water, but to dump black water we didn't see where. I give three stars for being beautiful, quiet and free"
13715,706246,2,dundee3792,27/09/2019,DC area located next to the park. Access by road next to Repsol or then take the street leading to the DIA and continue on the path.
13715,701731,4,moustaches31,23/09/2019,"Very quiet place where we spent the night. Park between 2 trees facing the service area and back to the creek. Beware of vehicles over 7m, the rear talu is high. A small gutter more or less deep borders the path. In case of rain the ground may be muddy. Too bad the toilets are not cleaned every day. 1st road on the right after the REPSOL station."
13715,701348,3,Zgzstark,23/09/2019,"To spend the night is very good. The bathrooms are really a disaster, people do not take care of free services a shame. You can load and unload water, even the toilet."

13715,659329,5,Erkaban,25/08/2019,"For now the best I've been. And not only for being free, but also for being an example of education and citizenship. The public does not have to be worse if we all maintain it. Lawn, Services, showers, bar, leveling, dirty water cleaning, everything. I'm sure something is missing and someone puts some fault. You also have a camping area on grass. Of everything."

13715,598343,4,jimena53,04/08/2019,"I subscribe to all the previous good opinions, the only problem is that the bathrooms depend on the nearby bar, and depending on who has the year and the good or bad, depends on whether they are clean or dirty. This year they are quite clean, but instead they have removed something that we value very much, hot water. I hope the city council takes good note."
13715,594054,5,DjPin,02/08/2019,"Excellent place, clean bathrooms and cared for by the bar. Great pizzas and attention! There are snacks, barbecue, playgrounds. The town is worth a visit. I wish all areas were like that."

Toilet blocks are fine, showers don't have a curtain or door however when it's quiet as it was for us you don't get disturbed (showers are each walled off, but no door).

Fresh water available at the waste dump.

Overall a nice spot.

4 star as semi open showers could be an issue for me in busy times."

13762,1642385,3,MF1,13/10/2021,Hard to drive over grid to let grey water go - beside this grey water there is a place to empty black water. The switch for to fill water is behind red bricks where the two taps are - great place to take a break
13762,1633921,3,Lanapangea,09/10/2021,"The area is neglected, we spent the night with a lot of noise from the road. The gray drain is sure to seep from all sides, the grate is raised. For the black drain it is not clear if it will be a hole in the gray grid, or is it that there is no black drain. Two taps, but no water."
13762,1597399,3,Paichi,21/09/2021,"To park and visit the town, perfect. If you want to carry water, you have to turn the stopcock behind it. To sleep, I do not recommend it. Pass a national highway right next to it, it's too noisy."

When I have been and it is quite clean, although it lacks a bit of maintenance on the part of the person in charge. A threaded tap is ideal.

As against I would say that the tap to load water does not have a thread for hoses and you have to be pressing often. The cars from the next street can be heard but they did not bother me to sleep. Generally good area.
13789,2602133,4,Virtass,07/03/2023,Perfect town square. V+E problem-free. Tap without thread/connection. Therefore water thief or watering can necessary. Had no problems with entry and exit with the app. Can also be used in many other cities.

All services (they have already differentiated dirty and clean water taps). Noisy at night as it is attached to a main 6-lane avenue and a lot of traffic.

To enter there is an assistance button but basically in the celadora you have to choose 24 h 5 € and that's it. A 5-minute walk away is La fragata 2, a cafeteria with a full breakfast, with natural orange juice, and a very kind woman."

Thank you very much to the municipality. but they have to improve the area."
13789,2417372,3,Edouard2706,02/10/2022,Air well located with water and garbage services. The only problem is that it is near a nightclub. Avoid on weekends because it feels like a nightclub!

Many thanks to the council for providing this type of area."

Start and only pay €5 in and then everything is displayed, don't forget your own license plate."" The place is not fenced."
13789,2409456,2,Anairam,28/09/2022,"Comfortable and close to the center as they say, but the fountain to load water does not have a thread so for me, at least, it is very difficult to put water to the point of not being able to put it. You must pick up the ticket as soon as you enter! I didn't read this because I was in a hurry and I've gone crazy to pay, go out, etc. Please, that one of the two taps has a thread!"
13789,2371538,2,ptcarlospt,14/09/2022,"It's not expensive, but payment system is confusing. In addition, it is not possible to pay several nights at once, having to go and get a new ticket every day and take care not to forget or miss an appointment. At the exit, the control was manual, an employee came to check my tickets, he made a mistake in the accounts, I had to explain myself in a language I don't know and only then release my exit. Wouldn't go back."

Congratulations to the city council for thinking about the motorhomes... but a big drawback, you're a bad sleeper... a lot of noise... a piece of advice, stand at the end of the area, because there is no respect for the people who sleep here.

13789,1754303,1,LaRamonettadeBlan,13/02/2022,"It's 7:30 in the morning and there are still people around screaming, drunk, racing cars, etc. It is a shame that the Valladolid city council charges for this service and that not even the municipal police come through here. I do not recommend it."
13789,1749444,2,plv45,06/02/2022,"Well placed area as well as price and services. But I confirm the comments of passing motorhomes on 01/16/22. This area is to be avoided on a Saturday evening. Young alcoholics screamed all night, from 11:00 p.m. to this morning. They were harrassing passers-by at 9:30 a.m. when we left. Squealing tires when starting and braking. It was a difficult night."
13789,1740381,4,Erriberri,24/01/2022,"Exclusive to AC. Very good location with large spaces, €5 24h. The night of 01/21/2022 very quiet. It seems to me a very good option, at least during the week...!"
13789,1735424,1,Asunsp65,16/01/2022,"Not recommended at all, you pay €5 a day and it is not guarded. Quite a conflictive nightclub next door, until 7 in the morning fights leaving a boy on the floor. we will not return"

13789,1709772,3,izaneta,14/12/2021,"€ 5 24h approximately 30 seats, filled and emptied of grays and blacks. Quite noisy from traffic but can be coped with. It scored three stars because to get water out and empty you have to lift manholes and there is no other place to rinse the bathroom cassette than the fountain itself and it is unsanitary and uncomfortable if this problem were solved it would be perfect."
13789,1699274,2,dinamica52,28/11/2021,"The only good thing is the location near the center and spacious squares. Noisy, lots of people partying at night, the water fill tap is a non-threaded fountain. For a city like Valladolid, I find few places"

13789,1670292,1,Huf,31/10/2021,"Terrible on a Saturday night. The lot borders some sort of discotheque in one corner. At half past two in the morning it's teeming with shouting and pissing teenagers between the motorhomes. 

Other than that you pay €5 just for parking; no services. Whilst a central location it seems a bit of a waste."

13789,1628757,3,zilviaas,05/10/2021,"The area itself is fine. Fairly level and spacious. The problem is that the road can be heard a lot. Until 1 and from 6:30 in the morning there is a lot of traffic. We go in a van with a lifting roof, even inside the motorhome you can hear less."
13789,1627806,5,Merychus,05/10/2021,Excellent parking to visit Valladolid without noise close to shops and bars. To put a problem as a colleague has said is that passers-by is not closed and they walk around looking at you like cows on the train

But to avoid for the night if you want to sleep, the car park is located between 2 busy boulevards, so there is a very high level of noise pollution which is incompatible with a night's sleep. Small sound lull between 1 and 6 a.m. ....."

13789,1384243,4,MiguelMY,30/07/2021,"Near the center, a short walk. The price of 5 euros seems correct to me. The squares are big. To put a but, the emptying area is right next to the exit, and if your intention is to empty / load to leave you have to maneuver a lot to be able to do it, otherwise everything is correct and thank the City Council for having created the area."
13789,1383272,4,EldaDC,30/07/2021,"A short walk from the center. Spacious places. The only but that I put is the difficulty to maneuver when turning to leave the area and to load and unload waters, since it is right next to the exit barrier and does not allow much margin of movement."

Reasonable price of € 5 for 24 hours (whatever time you are). The barrier does not work and it is very annoying to have to call and wait for them to open. But it is not fenced and people constantly cross it which gives a feeling of insecurity. We finally decided to leave and not sleep there. It is a pity that the city council has not thought about that aspect. On 9/9/2020 construction begins"

We were on a Saturday and we only paid for the parking until midday which cost € 1.30. Sunday is not paid. Water and sewage services are free. Cheer up and visit Valladolid which is a jewel and thanks to the town hall for the area"

On the weekend from Saturday it is free, that is, you do not get a ticket. The attention of the people is great, pleasant and polite. A welcoming city. Free loading and unloading services, although the water did not work on Sunday the 15th the water did not work, which is why I do not give it 5 stars, but I recommend this place yes or yes."

13789,118065,5,knaussudwind,09/01/2017,"Magnificent place halfway between Galicia and Madrid. Quiet, ideal to spend the night, visit Valladolid. We travel by car and caravan. We unhook the trailer and park the car in the square in front, although it also has parking spaces in series so as not to separate the trailer car. I recommend it to all caravans so that you do not stop to sleep at gas stations."
13789,117872,4,salolimu,06/01/2017,"Good area, you have to get a ticket at 9 in the morning but it's free, you just have to register at the booth. The taps do not have threads, but we discovered that on the right side there is a lid with 2 threaded fries, you just have to lift the lid. It is allowed to park in other parking rows, you just have to tell the girl in the parking lot. We almost left because it was full."

Close to the city center even on foot, a few trees as a bonus ;) On the other hand, quite noisy at night, on a Saturday evening (07/09/2016) techno music until 5:30 a.m., various screams... Hard to sleep for sensitive people ."

Just walk to the barrier that closes the park. Quiet and uneventful night. Of course, during the week, the same during the weekend is different."
13798,1828994,3,anhorakova,16/04/2022,In the night calm and nice place (we even slept in a tent but do not recommend) but in the morning there was sooo many cars coming to the National park. Surroundinga are beautiful though!

13808,2297612,2,Novatis,25/08/2022,"Chance of some shade, but the site was scary. The Lake is a dry pool at this time and the place is very hot. We passed just like the other nearby parking lots. In August life is not possible there."
13808,2281921,3,M.BoXeR,21/08/2022,"Place far from life, western setting, if the Lone Ranger appears it would not be strange. It may have had better times, in August the lake is drier than a cricket's armpit. Fire falls from the sky. The restaurant has cold beer, I recommend the place just because it is picturesque, there is shade and it is a great experience to tell our grandchildren about."
13808,2104989,4,flipo1996,22/07/2022,"Clean place, we came at night and stood between the trees, when we woke up in the morning we first saw how beautiful it was, unfortunately some cars driving by in the morning hours, but very remote at night, you can see the stars great, In the morning the owner of the restaurant spoke unfriendly in Portuguese, but she couldn't understand it, it might be worth going straight to the water."
13808,1904115,5,mallewim,21/05/2022,"Great quiet place! You have to look for a vertical piece, but then you have something! Nice and shady under the trees. Turn on your bird sounds app and you will leave behind about 20 species of birds! When you leave: take a look around and clean up some mess! Picnic guests also come here. They sometimes leave something behind! Small effort right??"
13808,1750021,5,SerendipitousNomads,07/02/2022,"Picturesque view and walking tracks around the Barragem. Peaceful place. A few other campers. Had drinks at the Cafe but was told no food available for dinner despite other camper folk eating, so maybe it is necessary to pre book?"

There is a small sink / soap on the side of the building. Toilet that I used my own. Come again? ""yes, I'm not demanding"
13808,1624112,4,FranciscoCarrico,03/10/2021,"Spent 7 nights here, completely away from the world. The view is not amazing but it's still very nice and the silence and peacefulness is just great!
Ate grilled chicken at the restaurant near by once and it was fine. I see a lot of comments about the owners being grumpy here, just think they're old and isolated, but they're nice
There's a camping near by were you can change waters for 6€."
13808,1591750,3,Majatour,19/09/2021,An outstanding view of the reservoir. Therefor the three stars. The owner of the restaurant is very grumpy and not neat. His ajar dogs bark half the night. Free range chickens and guinea fowl should be watched. GNR came by several times with no problems. We stood there with 6 caravans.
13808,1567566,5,staceandmaya,11/09/2021,Beautiful quiet spot amongst the trees and next to the dam. Restaurant seems nice but didn’t use and was undisturbed. Bins here too. Few other campers so felt safe as solo traveller.
13808,1233172,5,vanessabarragao,03/06/2021,"We got to this spot during the night. We could see the stars by the sound of the local nature, amazing! The night was relaxed and without any extra noise.when we woke up we could see the marvelous view. Amazing place!"

13808,799853,4,Mmmoustic,27/04/2020,"Because of Covid 19, we stayed 3 weeks first in the nearby woods and then in this parking lot. The place is wonderful for walks, and flowering in April, we went around the lake (8% full) in 6 hours. There is a lost place with little water or the carp come up to spawn. You can also walk to Panoias (water in the center of the village and shops) or Garvao. The take away next door can prepare grilled pork ribs and fries for 10 euros per person. Emptying at Castro Verde. Bread and vegetable vendors pass by from time to time."
13808,773962,4,cartaguche,29/01/2020,The perfect place to rest a good night. After an unsuccessful attempt at dialogue with the service grillad (not causing the innkeeper) we abandoned the business and had dinner in our motorhome.
13808,766502,2,coriander,09/01/2020,Very big space for parking on the two side of the road. There is shade on one of the side. The level of the lake is very low. Beside the road there is a restaurant without wc and with an unfriendly owner. It doesn’t seem like a good old place but a shitty and smelly house.

13808,638574,4,benedicte35,18/08/2019,"Really quiet place! Dry lake on the other hand ... (August 2019) otherwise calm, no wind, a few mosquitoes but given the place it is not surprising."

Indeed the welcome is singular, it's like really in the depths of the American West but we spent a very quiet and very pleasant night; if we could fish (the signs say no) and if there were minimum services, I would have stayed there for 2 or 3 days."

That is on the area provides access to the wifi with the code (without the quotation marks) ""g4gm8v4y"". The bistrotier rustic and without use is not therefore unpleasant."

It is tight, with narrowing streets that take you over a 1 lane bridge that is best suited for foot traffic.

If at night we were dazzled by the starry sky, in the morning we loved the sunrise and the shepherd taking his goats to graze. We will be back!"
13843,3234042,5,avivseri,29/08/2023,"Really quite, cell service, great view on the lake. Not to far from a place you can go swimming in the lake."
13843,3207852,2,SamuelZarco,23/08/2023,"Nice place to stop and spend a few hours, but perhaps the detour is not worth it. It doesn't seem like a safe place. Most of the trees in the photo have been felled, there is only a picnic area and a parking lot. I would not stay here."
13843,3148058,4,makepause,14/08/2023,A good spot for overnighting with many space. We took a bath in the lake but special swimming shoes are needed.
13843,2842932,5,gretawgn,11/06/2023,"Huge space, free seating and very quiet. trash can available."
13843,2838623,5,Reiziger14,10/06/2023,"Both nights 4 campers. During the day only some locals driving by on the road 50m away. Occasional stray dog. And the shepherd with his flock of sheep. The pitches are straight and fairly firm, despite being unpaved. Make sure you have a screen against flies and mosquitoes (also during the day). I didn't swim, it didn't look appealing with the bugs near the water, but it could."
13843,2823306,5,KamiBrown,05/06/2023,Beautiful quiet spot with lots of level spaces under trees. Lovely for swimming and paddle boarding. The dog loved it too
13843,2762940,5,djprojekt,19/05/2023,"Was our first place in Portugal and it was exactly as we imagined. On the water, super quiet, all the best."
13843,2752704,4,Dan-lauJoub,15/05/2023,"Very nice location without service, with a beautiful view of the lake. Accessible to motorhomes of 7.5 m and over. we spent a very calm night with beautiful photos for the sunrise."
13843,2649519,5,bunnygore,08/04/2023,"Very quiet, we had a great night without any problems. Some work vehicles passed by and in the morning a shepherd came to take care of the goats :)"
13843,2635132,5,rallyv12,02/04/2023,"amazing site. Peaceful night. Plenty of space, level, with another 3 more cars."
13843,2631437,5,antoniocardoso30,31/03/2023,I loved super quiet and peaceful night
13843,2618144,4,Carich,21/03/2023,Good location next to lake.  No facilities but fine for one night.
13843,2613700,4,Wunderkinder,18/03/2023,"The place is super quiet. But we weren't alone. The space is sufficient. We didn't like it so much that we stayed more than a day. But it's still nice and pleasant, with goats as neighbors. For us too little demanding and beautiful walks or hikes. Internet was fine. Trash can is available."
13843,2579998,5,Kurt-Suender,16/02/2023,Super nice place with lots of rest. Ideal with the dog. You can hike a lot and long at the lake. There is a lovely farm dog (last picture) who guards the goats. A large garbage can is at the top of the driveway.
13843,2575898,4,TaijaH,12/02/2023,This is great area with plenty of parking opportunities all over small dirt roads next to the resevoir. We slept very well and area is also nice for having some walks. There's one stray dog wandering around but he's kind and does not bother anyone.
13843,2571825,5,DiDU26,08/02/2023,"This stopover is very practical where you can stand on the banks, the water is abundant in this season and it's very quiet... Swimming for the brave is very cool... Warning: an internet network not always on top for teleworkers..."
13843,2463890,5,ThierryLeneutre,26/10/2022,"Magnificent place to rest, the dogs are adorable and endearing. They are just looking for a little affection. It's nature, it's quiet, it's beautiful, it's near Aljustrel and its amenities. Go there without hesitation."
13843,2376302,5,malugo,16/09/2022,Very quiet and spacious place to spend a night near the dam. Tables and benches under the trees. Shepherd dogs nearby with herds of goats. The dogs are very friendly and accompanied us on walks.
13843,2367977,5,VeganPixie,13/09/2022,"Beautiful spot, so super quiet, slept here like a dream! Loads and loads of flies right now though.

There are goats and dogs wondering freely here but they all seem quite friendly."
13843,2071321,5,DEDEdu72,14/07/2022,"Hello, hectares of meadows accessible via paths suitable for all (see depending on the weather). Sheep on the loose with the dogs but who stay away. Swimming is possible, not overlooked thanks to the vastness of the site. A strong wind is constantly present, in our case it was very hot. we recommend this spot which is one of the best possible."
13843,2053976,2,elhinchon,09/07/2022,"We spent an afternoon there and something strange happened to us with some locals, so we decided to leave. the place is very good, but I recommend to be careful..."
13843,1969853,5,TomLeveau,12/06/2022,"It is a vast space on the edge of the lake easily accessible, high pines provide shade. There is a pack of adorable dogs -even with our fearful husky- the only downside is that they bark from time to time."
13843,1957157,4,Fuzikipt,07/06/2022,"Beautiful place, quiet, close to the water..we've been twice. And we will come back for sure. But, no service. Beautiful nature. We have the presence of some beautiful and sweet dogs, if you can provide them with food, I believe they have no home."
13843,1904088,4,mallewim,21/05/2022,"Very quiet at night! We were guarded by 6 dogs! Very sweet! If you are not afraid of dogs, check them for ticks! I have removed 25 ticks from 1 dog! Just pull out!"
13843,1746525,3,mich44,03/02/2022,be careful do not leave your shoes outside because shoe stealing dog
13843,1681029,3,Silvia_Lorenz,07/11/2021,"Actually a great place, however, there are 3 large free-running dogs. Friendly to people but who is afraid of dogs or has dogs with them should look for another place."
13843,1664813,5,OllieBB,27/10/2021,Nice quiet place on a reservoir. Trash cans and picnic tables available. Shepherd roams around here with sheep and goats. Nothing but silence and tranquility.
13843,1529979,4,mmmmmmmaix,30/08/2021,"We spent one night here. Quiet place (in the middle of nature) with a lake next to it. It was very hot but it is what you have to go in August. At night we were visited by 3 dogs that were probably the shepherd's, they left immediately. During the day many flies, we left because it was very annoying. We were completely alone. No services."
13843,1249618,5,seriane,12/06/2021,Great place for those who love tranquility and nature! thank you to the next ones for respecting this magnificent place! easy access
13843,1174556,5,stuart58,16/04/2021,Lovely place right on the lake nudism naturism possible can swim andfish
13843,1085733,5,AnaPkt,08/10/2020,Quiet place by the water. We spent the night and woke up to a beautiful sunrise
13843,1038923,5,raffanoise,10/09/2020,"Incredible site. I parked near the water, mega starry sky, completely isolated. I've stayed here twice. In one of them I contacted nomadic gypsies, something very rare these days."
13843,824616,5,JLYR,14/06/2020,Nature spot. Nice view. Calm apart towards the picnic tables ... We were 3 CC scattered towards the water's edge. Perfect.
13843,823453,4,JLYR,13/06/2020,Top. superb and calm landscape. only drawback: flies ... but bearable?
13843,798260,5,Joanja,08/04/2020,"Very nice area and lots of level places under trees. From time to time cars drive over the dam, apart from the other two campers, only the shepherd and his animals were there. Super calm and relaxing. Garbage cans available on site."
13843,778592,5,aventurerfamily,10/02/2020,Very nice spot
13843,775962,5,DrivingDeeDee,03/02/2020,The perfect parkup. plenty of space for campers at the top but no-one else was there when we arrive so we drove all the way down to the waters edge. a but bumpy and rocky track but possible even in an 8m 3.5tonne sprinter. Quite a few flies on the evening so we kept the doors shut but during the day when it was hot they disappeared. would highly recommend!
13843,772280,5,MBDETRI,25/01/2020,Super place if you go to the lake shore. There is some traffic on the square on the street in the evening.
13843,764956,5,cortez77,05/01/2020,Awesome spot.
13843,758905,5,Fabien14,29/12/2019,We loved this place. Calm and peaceful. What was there good. Shepherd who passes daily with his animals.
13843,741202,4,c_OOl,10/11/2019,Quiet place in nature fantastic view. Currently many cranes are present. It's better not to have a dog here. The dogs of the shepherd are quiet against people. But get completely wild from other dogs. It is therefore their terrain.
13843,740103,5,Rene33,08/11/2019,Beautiful area. Larger room so as not to interfere. We only came here for lunch but seemed great for the night.
13843,670375,5,Melyo29,31/08/2019,"Spot very quiet, as a passage, there is only the shepherd who left his herd at 19h and returned at 8am. In early August, there was only one motorhome to accompany us and saw the space, it was more than 50 m from us. Possibility of getting closer to the lake towards the sheepfold. Clean place."
13843,524392,4,LESDUFF,22/06/2019,Beautiful step not to be missed !!!
13843,521382,5,andrewmack,19/06/2019,"Quiet, no barking dogs or noisy roosters. One dog came up to van but just wanted some food. Very peaceful, there was only two vans overnight."
13843,517034,5,ASousa,16/06/2019,"Very beautiful and super calm place. There was no place in the parking lot for only 5 seats and I went to get closer to the water, without any problem. It was even more enjoyable."
13843,461655,5,Saffron,21/04/2019,Beautiful and quiet place to spend the night and sightseeing. Shepherd dogs have always walked close to us but are very kind
13843,432585,5,CNelmes,23/02/2019,"A great spot, very peaceful with great views across the lake. Do not come here with a dog. There are local sheep dogs that roam free, fine with people but attack dogs in vans."
13843,429819,4,sam'plais,16/02/2019,Extra quiet in nature
13843,416256,5,atos1,26/12/2018,"Alone for 5 days over Christmas, only the small goat herd and friendly herding dogs. Now and then a car of the workers of the waterworks. You can also stand under the trees."
13843,388539,2,popo305,06/10/2018,"It was not until the night falls to be quiet because this place is very popular with locals. One who comes to wash his car, young people turning in mobilettes, 4x4 passing and repassing"
13843,374837,5,joerub,16/09/2018,"Had a good night, very quiet and very nice place, with a nice surprise this morning, the landing of 2 hot air balloons right next to us. Simply unforgettable."

13843,255374,5,mistytoo12,19/05/2018,Nice clean spot. Off the road just beside the car park enjoyed it !
13843,233425,4,Linasb,05/04/2018,"Good place to spend a night. It has a large tap with non-potable water. There are picnic tables. The shepherd's dog approached, but it is not aggressive."
13843,218488,4,rvanvugt,11/01/2018,"A nice, clean and quiet public parking offering space for a small number or campervans. Quiet through the night, just in the morning some cars passed.
Good spot to start some hiking and walking around the lake.
The dogs of the shepherd are indeed aggressive towards other dogs, not too humans. My dog was bitten by one of them, luckily no big harm. Be warned!
No services but a container for disposals, keep the area clean. 
GNR passed 2 times in the morning and waved friendly... ???"
13843,202477,4,Marloufabnina,13/10/2017,Nice spot far from the roads so quiet except from 5:30 for us. 3 4x4s that rolled really fast. But good night anyway. Clean and flat. Tap available.
13843,173481,4,Youpia,13/08/2017,"Quiet, not drinkable water, provide a big fitting, dogs not bad."
13843,117159,3,Djuna,30/12/2016,Good for a quiet night. But in fact be careful with dogs very nice with humans but much less with dogs.
13843,74211,3,bagou,22/05/2016,"Indeed, very quiet place, very pretty. I just wanted to warn to pay attention to the dog that must be at the shepherd, he is always present. This dog attacked and bit my dog. Be careful for both dogs and children."
13843,66990,4,chou,01/04/2016,Super calm and very pretty
