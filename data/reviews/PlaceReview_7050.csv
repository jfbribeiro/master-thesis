94772,2514241,4,Georgeblonde,06/12/2022,"Very quiet place at least at this time. I do not put 5 because there is no water to fill the tank or any other ""comfort"". site to recommend. Nature and silence at night."
94772,2433579,5,danpez,09/10/2022,Magnificent site next to the river. Quite a few flat sites and access road in perfect condition. Amazing place away from noise
94772,2247082,4,AgustinAlapont,16/08/2022,"The site is very quiet, with the river a few meters away, with little depth, I recommend wearing booties, it is quite level and shaded by trees. in the middle of August it cools down at night, better to go prepared. the town is about 15min. on foot, the Civil Guard barracks about 8 minutes."
94772,1640960,4,Balucita,12/10/2021,Good place to eat and sleep. Shadow and river. Something dirty.
94772,1493309,5,t4paulasss,21/08/2021,"Good place, people a bit rude, but that's being lucky ..."
94772,1459868,5,AndresMarMan,15/08/2021,"Very quiet and cool place to sleep, with the river a few steps away, perfect for spending the night. it's like for about 5 campers. MY DIES!"
94772,1361332,5,SilviaViajera,25/07/2021,"Large esplanade with lots of shade next to the river to get your feet wet. When we were alone it was very quiet but many motorhomes and camper vans arrive, if you want to make friends it is the best, but somewhere else."
94772,1314754,5,coves82,11/07/2021,"I was there on 7/10/21, the Civil Guard approached us and told us that they could not stay overnight, they were not fined… .. the site is a very nice and quiet pass"

94772,1007249,4,Oscarayala,27/08/2020,"Quiet place by the river, quite a few flies and mosquitoes for being so close to it. During the day there is a little traffic of people and bathers, at night we sleep completely alone. Very cool night to be in the middle of August. Just 5 minutes from Villalba, where there is a super full supermarket and the tablazo restaurant, highly recommended."
94772,976291,5,RikiEvalia,18/08/2020,"Good place to sleep next to the river. I recommend if you go with dogs, they can bathe without a problem."
94772,938990,5,cheteac,08/08/2020,"Ideal place with shadows between trees and the Júcar river next to it. Very quiet, we spent two nights. The town is an 8 minute walk away. I recommend going to El Tablazo restaurant, a very nice place with a bathing area. Possibility of mountain bike and hiking routes, also to do the ravine and the via ferrata of Ventano del Diablo."
94772,431471,5,Davillu,20/02/2019,Very quiet place and very beautiful. Be careful with the branches of the trees when entering. I entered a motorhome and perfect but you have to be careful.
94789,1518504,2,LaVitola,27/08/2021,Too lonely and secluded unsafe
94789,1515374,4,SilviaCarrillo,26/08/2021,"Perfect place to stop for a bite to eat. Little shade, but with a fixed awning. Some cars pass but they don't tell you anything."
94789,1343731,1,Wally2020,20/07/2021,10% incline to get there bumpy place next to road we don't stay here
94789,1099575,3,slopestyle,20/10/2020,"Sloping parking, quiet, without services, several places, even for large vehicles."
94796,3068687,2,thacole,03/08/2023,nice for hiking and visiting the waterfall but not for spending the night. it's right next to the road and sloped.
94796,2644177,5,AusteKairyte,06/04/2023,"Very calm, near the beautiful waterfall. From there you can hike to beginning of waterfall. Highly recommend."
94796,2303960,5,andersonpt,26/08/2022,"great place to spend the day, have a barbecue, picnic, cool off on the small beach, relax."
94796,2282788,5,Amly83,22/08/2022,We parked a little further for the night (area with abandoned rubble ☹️) A quiet night on a Sunday evening after a fairly noisy day with lots of family and music. But with these heats we were very happy to be cool and by the river. Short walk to do with waterfall.
94796,1810245,5,JoseLopes,08/04/2022,"Very peaceful park for a family picnic. Very calm water for children to play. Lots of tables, grills and toilets."
94796,1408732,4,Domingo72,05/08/2021,Cleaned up. very nice.
94796,946681,1,tribunormand,10/08/2020,Dirty and uninteresting place
94796,854793,5,Cessyle,08/07/2020,"Super nice corner but a little sloping except to park at the bottom. Picnic tables, barbecue, small beach in the shade. The road from the east (upper Douro) is closed due to a collapse. You have to access from the west (dam side)"
94796,625127,4,phareouest,13/08/2019,Indeed it is not very flat. Many tables and shade. Small beach for dipping (it is very cool but the kids did not resist)
94796,366881,4,sosso55,07/09/2018,Slightly sloping but very nice place. We stayed the night
94829,2200911,5,luismartinpenagos,09/08/2022,Good place to cool off in summer. The natural pools are very beautiful. Quite busy. It is advisable to bring beach chairs and water shoes. You can park near the pool instead of the upstairs car park which is further away.
94829,1646391,3,MarleneFuchs,15/10/2021,"Must be a great spot in the summer, the natural pools look great. However, everything was closed in October, including the toilets."
94829,1439393,4,yayo13,11/08/2021,"Very wide area, flat and above all quiet. Next to the natural pools."
94835,736535,5,LurtaAlaia,02/11/2019,We slept here the night of November 1 to visit the city the next morning. The parking is freshly paved and in perfect condition.
94835,615946,2,Piolin,10/08/2019,"In the nearby pools in August 2019, not a drop of water. I suppose that in the rainy season there will be water, but in the summer and when you most want a cool bath .... IMPOSSIBLE. Too bad. The orchards need water and divert the river for its use (normal), but people can not cool off in summer. But there is a fountain (with water) and shaded tables."
94835,332183,4,lomario,13/08/2018,"There is a contact phone to arrange a guided tour of the site, on Mondays closed."
94852,1688094,5,antsinboots,13/11/2021,"Normally cars stop at the road to the entrance to the Turia gorges, but in the weekend it gets crowded so people stop all over the place, left and right of the road, between the olives. Locals don't seem to mind. Nevertheless we stopped on the side of a side road. Spent three great days here."
94852,1268478,5,KarenyPablo,21/06/2021,We had a nice night there. Very good site. From 21 to 7 or 8 in the morning no cars pass and during the day there are not many who pass. Chulilla is about a 20 minute walk away. From the site there is a small path that leads directly to the cliff. The only thing we didn't like is that around the trail there were papers and trash from other campers.
94885,2696658,4,fanch.gourvil,25/04/2023,"I hesitated between 3 and 4 stars. We are not very far from the highway, even if it is almost not visible, we can hear it even when. It was raining and we were able to shelter under the porch of the church for dinner, which was very comfortable for our young children! Indeed, we were protected from the strong wind from the coast. In short, not completely ideal but does the job very well!"
94885,2221279,1,Sonaea,12/08/2022,(July 2022) drove on because we wanted to have a picnic there but the grass has grown far beyond the picnic benches. It was no longer possible to sit down on a bench there
94885,2215012,4,neoderiba,11/08/2022,Quiet place on a very little busy road. Level ground and trash nearby. There are no more services! watch out for mosquitoes
94885,1780031,4,Natas,11/03/2022,"Pretty quiet place next to the church, opposite is the cemetery. There is a fast flowing river next to it, you can hear this well at night. The neighbor's dog came every day to cuddle. From here it is a half hour walk to the coast."
94885,1147402,3,Kaour,06/03/2021,Quiet place. I stopped there to eat only. The beach of the cathedrals is not to be missed.
94885,994905,4,amsguerrero,23/08/2020,"Quiet place, ideal to eat or rest, the area of the cathedrals beach is shameful, crowds of people without respect, the AC parking taken by cars, however it is forbidden to park AC in the car parks"
94892,1361624,1,Na41,25/07/2021,"The place is not bad, the uncivilized kids in the town are bad, a group threw a stone at the van in the middle of the morning, making a dent, with the consequent complaint to the GCivil"
94892,1191629,5,bozamadriz,10/05/2021,"We spent one night there, it is a very beautiful town, the people are very friendly and very quiet to spend the night. No noise and the people there are more than used to vans and motorhomes that spend the night in their car parks."
94892,959152,3,snowflake4,13/08/2020,Due to COVID the natural pool is closed.
94892,666649,5,Rmo86,29/08/2019,Very quiet and beautiful place to spend the day
94892,573116,4,Smuelas3,24/07/2019,The parking is quite flat. It doesn't have much shade. The bar has not yet opened the kitchen with what being forbidden to put drinks and meals from outside you have to eat in the AC. Otherwise a very quiet place to spend the day.
94892,545782,4,raultg,09/07/2019,"The site is phenomenal, next to the natural pools (free admission), above is the other parking of the jet, there they charge you € 5 for the whole day, it is also great with bathrooms and barbecues. I put 4 stars because it would be great that they will enable us a place."
94892,537790,4,etxea,03/07/2019,"We have spent one night, but it is worth spending more. Next to the natural pools and their beach bar. Near El Chorro, very nice area"
94904,3069053,1,EduAlonzo,03/08/2023,"Avoid, height limits in all entrances! They don’t want us, let’s spend our money somewhere else."
94904,1811643,2,jannahollema,09/04/2022,don't go on weekends; absolutely no place to be found
94904,1455085,4,Zulaya,14/08/2021,"Not recommended for spending the night but to leave the van or the AC without getting into the center, since in August there is an impossible traffic. The parking lot is very large and there is always room. There is height limitation at 2.80m but if you park outside there is no clearance control. With bus 33 you get to the perfect center. The bus ticket is € 1.85 per person."
94904,358730,2,gon943,29/08/2018,"I confirm the place, behind the Eroski hypermarket, nearby bike lane and urban bus it takes walking to the center about 30 minutes. They do not usually spend the night AC."
94909,2479646,1,BarbeetRousse,02/11/2022,not at all suitable for a 6m motorhome or van. only one place and not at all flat.
94909,2251219,2,SteDanRhin,16/08/2022,"We slept here out of necessity, not a frequented place. If you are passing through, you can go."
94909,971061,2,fuzek,16/08/2020,"There is almost no room, it is next to the track. To stay a while is fine, but to spend the night better the recreational area on the other side."
94909,953867,2,Yokoloko,12/08/2020,"The place is quite seedy but it is good to spend a night passing by. From time to time an airplane is heard but it does not bother at all, a very quiet place"
94909,629683,5,Emaborsa,15/08/2019,"At first sight it looked as a simple parking lot. But once you cross the little bridge you get to a big picnic area with some BBQ spots. There is also a tap for water, i spotted the pipe coming from the other side of a second bridge who leads to some houses, so i guess the water is potable. However it is to far to use it to refill your tank :)"
94909,349709,4,AKELA2032,23/08/2018,"Very nice spot. Where I asked myself: under a canopy of trees, shade, river, cool, quiet! Ideal for visiting a few days the cuidad de San Tiago (15, 20 minutes by car). No services. 2 to 3 vehicles in single file. Big jigs to avoid! No height limit. Do not hesitate .... The site is clean, so ....."

94917,2859403,4,hannah339,16/06/2023,"Great for one night. Quiet . felt safe . However, only four stars - because there is rubbish everywhere. possibly from other campers. Clear away your trash. Trash cans are available"

94917,2310210,3,simon31fr,27/08/2022,"Night spent on 08/16: that evening, football training so a lot of comings and goings in the parking lot and lighting of the field but calm at night. On the other hand, this evening it was very windy all night (but contrary to other comments, we were not under the trees to the right of the car park because access is not so easy with an old van due to a very bumpy steep path to get there. to access)."
94917,2306458,5,jodiedonnard,26/08/2022,places that saves a lot of wind indeed. It helped us a lot because at first we had planned to stay on the coast (lots of wind). calm night.
94917,2108016,3,gicaton,22/07/2022,"It was a good emergency spot for us as there was too much wind to stay at the coast. It is quite busy here until late at night (cars passing by, people walking dogs) and early in the morning kids come to play football."

94917,1803368,5,kristof_g,01/04/2022,"fantastic place, really quite and out of the wind. close to mountainbike trails. but, be aware there is a new law in Portugal since 2021 that you're not allowed to camp/park anymore where you want. between 21h and 7h it's forbidden to be parked anywhere with a car with living space (vans and motorhomes). it's only allowed on dedicated places. we didn't have any trouble but we were warned about it"
94917,1796542,4,Alex717,26/03/2022,"Probably not the nicest place but it’s okay, really for a night or so. We had a quiet night. Nice: recycling station right there."
94917,1775752,5,fipsii,06/03/2022,We stayed for two nights and had no problems. Some people come here for walking or taking their dogs out. The soccer field was most of the time busy but we were not disturbed at all. Mornings and late evenings were quiet. Good place to reach some mountain bike trails.
94917,1759747,5,walterontour1,19/02/2022,"We stayed here because there was too much wind by the sea. You are somewhat protected here, but not completely.

94917,564472,4,mattchuuuveitch,20/07/2019,Really great spot to hide from the wind. No services nearby but it was quiet and the wind blocked by the trees all around.
94917,498724,2,klickser,31/05/2019,Small clay court at the fence of a sports stadium and nothing around. Sea far away. Rather to see as a stopgap.
94917,424132,3,capreg82,23/01/2019,"Quiet and more sheltered, unless the wind comes from the ground ... quiet night. Otherwise place without interest."

94946,2741462,5,zwoiufftour,11/05/2023,big place There is a straight seat at the back. Very quiet during the week in the low season. Walkers come during the day.
94946,2305862,3,jerome6769,26/08/2022,Thank you to the municipality for giving us access to the parking lot for the day. Small nice bar below. Pleasant path to get to the buffones of Pria. There is parking for the night in the town next door.

94946,1441308,4,GerardJusto,11/08/2021,"Quiet place, although quite close to some houses. It has a slight incline. There is a bar nearby and the walk to the jesters is worth it."
94946,1383644,5,newcaravan,30/07/2021,"We slept in mid-July (one AC), waiting to see if they came to tell us something, but we really did not see any sign prohibiting sleep. The site is on a slope but at the top it is completely level. The beach that is nearby and the buffoons of Pría, amazing."
94946,1265742,5,asturmano,20/06/2021,"Very quiet place to sleep, at the top very level. At 10 in the morning the Civil Guard appeared saying that they were going to file a complaint for having spent the night. I claim that I had not stayed overnight and that they could not prove it. There is no sign that prohibits parking at night. Perhaps a close neighbor with interests contrary to motorhomes can notify the Civil Guard."
94946,938774,4,escriboda,08/08/2020,"Tonight the police came at 3 in the morning (stealthy, at night and treachery) and they have left a photocopy (ONLY for motorhomes and camper vans, but NOT for vans) of the signs that require parking and spending the night exclusively in the area of Llanes. They have not denounced, they have only notified but could have done it at 10-11 at night, which would have been better understood. Still good site"
94946,922339,5,traslacortina,02/08/2020,"Perfect. I have spent two nights, I have only gone to sleep, during the day my car was not there. People ... The 1st night a caravan arrived at 23:00 making noise. The second night the same at 00:10: park, start, accelerate, chocks ... Then another with loud music. The last I heard arrive at 02:00. In the morning tables and chairs outside, then they don't let us spend the night in the places."

94946,907971,5,annayoscar,28/07/2020,"Very good day parking to go see the cliffs, it is free. You should not stay to sleep, for me it would be abusive. The buffoons' visits are fantastic, you have to walk 1.5km but it is a very pleasant walk"

Next to it there is a forest and a dump that can be used to spend the night if necessary. Thanks to the people for the initiative, but with a little effort you could make a place where you wanted to spend the night."
95012,1770929,4,MC4333,02/03/2022,Thank you El Toboso. The fully operational area. We slept next to a park and in the morning we visited the village. totally recommended
95012,1746163,4,Eduardo1205,02/02/2022,"Today everything in order and clean. The fall of gray water went wrong, the water goes in any direction except for the grid. It is clear that they did not ask Don Quixote for advice…."
95012,1704602,1,mergullo,06/12/2021,"Currently it cannot, and should not, be used. The gray grid is clogged with multiple wipes and droppings. If you lift the lid of the black drain, you will see a beautiful green lagoon overflowing and full of floating objects. The water tap, as already mentioned, has very little pressure and flow and in the grid that collects the water from this tap there are traces of wipes and stool"
95012,1696719,3,guismin,23/11/2021,"Okay, but the black water drain was very full and we could not empty it, and the tap for drinking water had very little pressure and we never finished filling!"
95012,1689829,2,koldoyMari,15/11/2021,"It is a town that is making it very beautiful and it is worth visiting, however the area does not enter motorhomes or large volume vans, it is jammed and very poorly maintained is a shame"

95012,1367520,4,tomel33,26/07/2021,"Still very practical, but the black water tank is clogged and almost overflowing ... The small wood next to it is very well shaded but difficult to access by large riders."
95012,1365789,3,pmc70,26/07/2021,"We tried to spend the night in the pine forest, but at 12 at night we heard strange noises and footsteps around the ac, we were alone. In the end we parked in front of the Civil Guard barracks. The system for emptying and filling does its job."
95012,1326848,5,Nacho_kmf,15/07/2021,"Place for filling water and emptying black / gray. The filling tap has a small thread, as you have to hold down it has a wire in place to keep it on its own (it would be nice if it had another type of tap). Even so, the council must be congratulated for thinking about ACs. We recommend a visit to Dulcinea's house (free) and the Cervantino museum (€ 2). Next to a pine forest where to stop."
95012,1193946,5,JosePili06,12/05/2021,Service area for motorhomes with the possibility of spending the night in the pine forest (ideal in summer). We recommend visiting the Casa de Dulcinea. Nice village. The toilet drain has a screen and the toilet cleaning tap has a low flow. For the rest great.
95012,1102749,4,Franruiz85,23/10/2020,"We have spent the night in the pine forest without problems, not a sound and it is quite flat to walk. We have used the service area to load water and empty grays. Good site."

95012,476713,1,FordNugget01,05/05/2019,You have to open the water tap by lifting a lid on the floor. There is no tap for clean water so it can not be used. If the sewage works. Very dirty area We only stop to eat. Next to a factory
95012,476625,2,xrius,05/05/2019,They have removed the water filling faucet. Only gray and black water can be emptied

The time we were in a quiet place, you can move far away from the road to avoid noise... There is a lot of shade. At night, well I don't know what's going on and if you can get any surprises."
95013,460046,1,furgopug,19/04/2019,"The site has enough inclination, if it is to rest for the day is worth but at night I do not advise it. We have had a bad experience with a man who has parked next to us, has approached and has begun to touch with the member outside. It is a point of gay encounters according to internet (rest area) Very bad roll really."
95022,2245431,4,Bideanbi,15/08/2022,"There was hardly any space in the whole town and even less free. Following this path, you will reach some sports areas where there are two parking spaces. At the furthest point there were motorhomes. It is free and there were no prohibition signs. We didn't sleep there but there didn't seem to be any problems."

95035,1864669,3,lagose,01/05/2022,It's a quiet site. A very large esplanade. Let's spend the night. Very emblematic at the gates of the Belmonte Castle.
95035,1839061,3,jumaolda,19/04/2022,It cannot be accessed with large Ac 7.50m. And less parking upstairs in the castle. It is a want and not be able. I visited the Castle and the Mills by motorcycle (from the San Clemente area) and it was spectacular. Highly recommended.

95035,1728779,2,RamonKTF,07/01/2022,"It is true that being able to spend the night near the castle is spectacular, but the esplanade leaves much to be desired. Very little level space and the rest with a lot of slope. You have to arrive during the hours when it is not open for visits and thus be able to find a suitable place for a motorhome"
95035,1705132,4,vitoco,07/12/2021,"Spectacular place, right next to the castle, it is true that it has many uneven parts, what we did was leave the ac at the entrance of the parking lot and first explore the terrain... very quiet night, we were 4 ac and campers, it is better to arrive after 18:30 when the parking is empty, the castle is closed on Mondays"
95035,1638133,4,1978Canto,11/10/2021,"Large free parking, with stones and dirt. Just before entering the car park there are some flats where it remains quite level, as the car park has a steep slope.

The swimming pool closed in this April, I can hear it, but at 35 € per night without elec for 2 adults and 2 children we are close to a scam in this season. Modern sanitary facilities contrary to the overall layout of the campsite."

Beautiful enclave but the civil guard woke us up at 830 informing us that it was not possible to spend the night on the entire coast, despite not being indicated at all.

95100,1537688,5,olgahotti,01/09/2021,Great place. Today we stood here with only one other camper and it was super quiet. The view is very nice and the reception 4G
95100,1526455,5,ra.jose,29/08/2021,"Esplanade of a hermitage, quite large and flat. with some shade. A large picnic table. Very calm. We have spent the night with 2 more vans"
95100,1525224,5,Albernis,28/08/2021,The site is great with a sky that looks perfect. when you arrive you are going to see a Montañita you have to go up a path to the top where there is a chapel
95100,1522111,4,ellysmokey,28/08/2021,Very peaceful place. Great to spend a night. There are no signs for the hermitage but the GPS leads correctly to the point.
95100,1505869,5,MartadelValle,24/08/2021,"Quiet and perfect place to spend the night! :) There was no other camper, but there is enough space for several. Being between trees and elevated, the noise of the road does not reach and it is cool. Very clean and cared for. It was our first experience with the camper and we loved it :)"

95100,1459063,4,Jaumenegro,15/08/2021,"A good place to spend the night, quiet and with a pine forest where you can leave the AC. We had a wind storm and heat wave, but in the morning when we got up it was very cool. It is a very good place to spend the day under the pines. Easy access for large ACs."
95100,1388831,5,AlexGz,01/08/2021,Quiet place to spend the night. It has a picnic table next to the hermitage. Perfect place to look at the sky and see the stars if you catch a clear night.
95100,1384524,5,sarayespinosa29,31/07/2021,"We have been very comfortable, it is quite flat. Tonight we slept with three other campers, but we were far from each other, because there is enough space. Google Maps took us all the way down, but you will see the little hermitage at the top, you just have to go up the road. Highly recommended !!"
95100,1362290,4,oihana5566,25/07/2021,"A very good place, on top of a hill. With a picnic table and garbage. Wide site without any hassle."
95100,1287785,5,ebeach,30/06/2021,We got there at sunset and it was amazing. Dozens of rabbits jumping as we went up. Brutal views and dusk. We sleep alone without the noise of cars and illuminated only by the light of the stars. Being in a high place it was cooler.

95100,1261396,5,Kikema,18/06/2021,Great quiet site near a small church. A car (we suspect it was police) passed by just before dawn but didn’t bother us. Lovely views of both sunrise and sunset

95100,1050213,4,magdass,15/09/2020,"A very good place. Quiet and shady. Accessible to AC. We only went for lunch but I think you have to sleep very quietly because you don't hear any noise, just a little bit of road traffic from afar."

95100,927203,5,anneso110382,04/08/2020,"Superb place, we spent one night there and we were there alone. The place is clean but with a lot of wind, which is not a problem in summer. Many trees to install a hammock."
95100,773247,5,clemtramp11,27/01/2020,"Super natural space in height with beautiful views of the surrounding cultures. Ultimately, it would involve setting up a motorhome area with shower and wifi. Free, paid? It will be a surprise. Hopefully the places remain natural and frequented by hares and foxes that we can see a lot. Take your waste because no trash. Two very quiet nights."

95144,3275627,5,MirVan,09/09/2023,"We spent two days with a large and great van, we loved it. The large plot with lots of shade and views of Pedraforca. The campsite has many services and parks for children. Two nights with electricity cost us 56 euros. We will repeat."
95144,3193677,1,mrjaques,21/08/2023,"Our experience was not recommended, there were two nights with a lot of noise and it was impossible for us to sleep. I do not recommend it."
95144,3025813,4,SarahAJ75,26/07/2023,"Stopped here for one night.
Reception was friendly. The toilets, showers, wash-up/laundry areas were very clean, especially in the lower part of the site. Area D had an amazing view of the Pedraforca.
For 5 stars, the swimming pools would be cleaner and a nicer restaurant, which offered limited choice for vegetarians and felt more like a canteen.
Overall, I would recommend this site."
95144,2655277,5,cabre_anna,09/04/2023,"Very family campsite with very clean and new services. In the toilet for the disabled, they have a changing table and a bathtub for babies. Spectacular views of Pedraforca."

Good pitches for campers, for large AC few and difficult. Very good price at this time, €23.50 camper, two people, with light."
95144,1591824,1,SilviaXevi,19/09/2021,The fatal restaurant. The campsite nothing. By motorhome very little plot
95144,1351837,5,mikelote72,22/07/2021,"Spectacular campsite, by location and situation, super friendly. A scandal-good meal at a laughable price. Store and cafeteria services very good. Clean facilities with people cleaning several times a day. Without a doubt a place to return and enjoy its facilities and its people."
95144,1119120,3,tetoni,03/12/2020,"Good reception, good facilities but it's a shame the place to empty gray water: it's on a climb and the wheels are slipping, it's also difficult to maneuver to get in and out. If they want to have motorhomes it should be improved !!"
95144,1111807,4,Danu,03/11/2020,Beautiful camping with a warm water dish washing room. Between permanent permanent motor homes but quiet. Good price and friendly staff. Close to hikes of Pedraforca and Gallina Pelada.
95144,905217,4,maick87,28/07/2020,Spectacular views of Pedraforca. Very clean. The same lacks better service in the shop and cafeteria.
95144,816845,3,Albert_Challenger,04/06/2020,"It's fine but I find it excessive that they charge € 5 a day for a dog. In our case 2 days with 2 dogs € 20. We were at the top of the campsite, with good views but the circulation is a bit complicated with very narrow streets and slopes. At the bottom of the road, we went for a ride and the pitches are much better. Having been down much better!"
95144,752073,2,SteveA12003,09/12/2019,Do not eat here the food is dangerous. We had the sausages and lamb. Sausages were cooked 2mm in and raw on the inside. Sent it back and. Came back with no change still raw. Lamb under cooked with the fat uncooked. Campsite has a great view in winter as no leaves on the trees. Good bike trail and walking right from the site
95144,574894,4,WanderWebb,25/07/2019,"Nice site with fairly good facilities. Very small shop on site and fresh bread available to order. The turn into the site should be taken with care for longer vehicles. Driving around to the pitches is then very awkward with narrow roads, bad slopes and cambers and uneven entrances to the rather small pitches. We stayed on the opposite side of the road where the pitches are slightly bigger and easier to access for larger units. ."
95144,546863,5,lacoca,10/07/2019,"A pass of Camping, the food, especially the breakfasts are unforgettable, the attention of the wonderful people, the perfect location ... we recommend it 200 x 100"
95144,396963,2,Smayu,21/10/2018,"Camping with all services. A part have heated pool with sauna and jacuzzi that is rented by the hour. The only bad thing is that it is expensive, 30 euros sleeping with the van one day and without light."
95162,3240254,5,SabrinaKK,30/08/2023,Access well signposted. We took advantage of the water and the opportunity to empty it. The place is wonderful!
95162,3222418,5,olgal60,26/08/2023,Simple but useful area. 2 min walk from town. Guided tours and charming town. We will surely repeat.
95162,2937280,4,Chasishome,08/07/2023,Very correct space with water charge and free emptying. If you approach in summer 50 meters spectacular municipal pool for 3 euros with services
95162,2865269,4,Icallejero,17/06/2023,"The entrance is rare, it is signposted by the bed of a river that is paved but the exit from the bed is a slope that is complicated if there is loose sand but hey we entered with an AC of 7.40m, the area is wide and flat, this next to the pools, we had a few portions for dinner, we slept well, some dogs could be heard but normal, the town is pretty and the bakery is very good"
95162,2748538,4,Corcho,14/05/2023,"Except that the entrance is somewhat ""strange"" but it is already well signposted so as not to enter through the bridge, the area is very good, good views, quiet and close to the town. A 10 for the town for the place."
95162,2642396,4,Alejandropolo,05/04/2023,"Next to the sports center, dirt, flat, water, gray and black free entrance by bridge if you are small and by the riverbed if you are older, next to the town."

95162,2600992,4,EDUARDOPARIS,06/03/2023,Peculiar access but nothing complicated. The area is great. Beautiful views and a very pretty town. The visits to the Castle and the guided visits to the Church-Museum of San Martin and the guided visit to the town are highly recommended. a great plan
95162,2583455,4,doomplanet,19/02/2023,Exciting to get over the bridge to the parking lot. The parking lot is fine. View of El Castillo.
95162,2507755,3,ToyTraveller,28/11/2022,"Although we accessed with a 7.40m AC, access is narrow and a bit tricky. The environment is quite abandoned although with good views of the castle. The service area is quite good. We did not spend the night."
95162,2505909,3,metjimmyoppad,26/11/2022,the access to the bridge is very narrow. campers go through riverbed.
95162,2493766,5,vanecalvocecilio,13/11/2022,Highly recommended. Beautiful views of the town and a close walk. Emptying of gray and black water. Sports facilities
95162,2451889,3,Peixera,19/10/2022,"Good views of the castle from the other side of the river. Flat ground with gravel. We recommend not accessing it by the bridge, better to do it by the river bed."
95162,2326573,3,jesgm,31/08/2022,"Area just to spend the night. It has some very powerful spotlights that turn on when people pass by and are on for many minutes, for economy it would be appropriate to reduce the timer of these spotlights. You can't hear the road"
95162,2283289,4,aedulcinea,22/08/2022,"inaccessible area for motorhomes. only small campers and PATERA cars. I have parked at the exit of the road to Sos in the collection of used furniture, good photo."
95162,2224079,1,chiquitin,12/08/2022,The town is beautiful and unfortunately we had to leave because the access was blocked by the car of some enlightened person. Too bad the city council does not control this because it generates tourism losses. We won't be back.
95162,2034194,4,ESCARTIN,03/07/2022,"Grijo soil area, well settled. The entrance has to be done by accessing through the dry riverbed. A Ten for this beautiful town, which leaves us free space, and has all the services, also free. They access any motorhome without problems. Mine seven meters and no problem."
95162,1895102,4,IrisDunkel,16/05/2022,"It's almost unbelievable, but the driveway actually goes through the cobbled Branca, please follow the signs, don't worry, we've also covered the length of 6.5m, there's another meter there. Residents were friendly and helpful. The view from the square above is really nice. Unfortunately, the adjacent outdoor pool wasn't open yet. Thanks to the community"
95162,1818489,2,Apcejuela,13/04/2022,The signaling is corrected!!! Although access through the channel is a bit complicated. The town is well worth it. Very friendly people provide you with everything you need.
95162,1787192,1,Lupivan,18/03/2022,"REGRETTABLE!!! Access over the bridge is practically impossible, even for cars or vans of 6 meters. Access by the river is blocked by parked cars. We couldn't get in. It is a pity that the city council does not worry about these things. We have gone to Sos del Rey Católico."
95162,1734796,1,La_Bicha_28,16/01/2022,"Impossible to access with 7m AC through the main access, because of the containers that are discussed here, either, since they park cars. We had to leave. a pity"
95162,1678307,5,Wanderingspirit,05/11/2021,"Very nice motorhome on a flat terrain with a view of the village and castle. Quietly located, at night there were occasional guard dogs barking. Excellent location for fresh water and the discharge of gray and black water. You have to go through the riverbed to reach the motorhome, the sign with the indication is actually in the wrong place."
95162,1588889,5,koteli,18/09/2021,"Nice and quiet place, access is somewhat difficult for large or low AC. We got a storm at 6.00 to shake the AC. We had dinner at Mou's bar and very well."
95162,1373472,4,haritzcarrera,28/07/2021,Good site fairly level and with services. The town is 5 minutes away and next to the swimming pools and the possibility of walking and cycling routes. Some noise from the winged ground dogs.
95162,1341609,3,Remolin,19/07/2021,Very close to this beautiful town. Very calm
95162,1178197,4,VanDame,23/04/2021,"Pretty tricky access. Over the bridge where the sign is NOT TRYING. Right at the bend, where there are some containers, you can access the riverbed (asphalt) and that is where you can cross. It was indicated by a local because nothing is clear. The area, correct, with good views and loading and unloading of water"
95162,1174803,4,AntonioDomingo,17/04/2021,"Great place, wonderful views and services, very good to be with the dog since there is no road nearby, it is not a 5 because there is no shade. Careful access for large vehicles."

95162,1127571,4,isabelSalvador,03/01/2021,We slept wonderful. We would be around 5 AC. Access a bit complicated but you can enter without problems.
95162,1127027,3,Davidolas,02/01/2021,"Access is about 50 meters before the sign on the bridge. You have to go along the river (it is paved and without water) to the bridge and climb. 50 meters from the beginning. for large ACs that is the way, some passes over the bridge but you run the risk of leaving half a car on the stones"
95162,1042126,2,JavierFrances,12/09/2020,"In the van you enter just without touching, the area is ""half well"" set up in the absence of shade and services"
95162,953949,5,filologoloko,12/08/2020,"Very good site. Incredible views and with all accessible town services: greengrocer, bar, bakery, restaurant. We bought some oil cakes that they indicated to us in the very good bakery. On the second day we ate at El Secreto restaurant. Very good option. Guided tour of the town. Area with free services. The people's initiative is appreciated."
95162,816141,4,Fredyzaragoza,03/06/2020,"Area in perfect condition. Emptying gray and black water and filling free drinking water. Thanks to the city council for this place. The entrance is a bit complicated, you have to enter through the ramp that goes down to the paved river bed and exit when you get to the bridge and not through it as the signal indicates. I have not had a problem with my 7.42 m. It does not have 5 stars because there is no shade."
95162,792600,5,aserpj,08/03/2020,Very quiet place with very good views of the town. well-kept area. access a bit narrow. pretty village
95162,789041,5,bichovito,01/03/2020,"It is to be grateful for any good intention on the part of the town councils to facilitate our trips but if it is true that the access is somewhat complicated, I with a 6 Mts gv well but a large ac has it more complicated although it can happen. We had the bad luck of having a carnival party in the pavilion and could not sleep so we had to move in the middle of the night"
95162,778453,3,silval,10/02/2020,"Difficult access by the point indicated by the signs, you have to pass a narrow bridge and to do so, make a turn of almost 90 on the road. There is another option, go through the river, but if there are cars parked on the ramp or the riverbed, wide vehicles do not fit"
95162,737352,4,casablanca,03/11/2019,"The driveway is a bit narrow, ok, but easily feasible. The place is big, central, all services are free, and the water is under pressure. (I find it unfair to give the place just a star just because you can not control your vehicle.)"
95162,734050,3,GaraziMayordomo,30/10/2019,"Access by a very narrow bridge somewhat complicated. A few meters away, you can go down a wide ramp and access the dry and asphalted riverbed. We recommend this option. Very nice views in front of the town. It is a little apart and without shadows. But we slept great and alone. Highly recommended to visit the town, beautiful."

95162,499128,4,DreamerD42,01/06/2019,We spent the night yesterday. Good place with loading and unloading services. Quiet night We got access to the bridge opening us a lot to face it well and to access without problems with our 5.40

On occasion, the comments made are not entirely objective. I have motorhome of 3 m in height and 6.50 in length and in the area of Uncastillo I have not had any problem to access the area by the river."
95162,442833,4,jorgeaz84,22/03/2019,"The area is well, quiet place and with beautiful views. The town is well worth a walk. Luckily it is warned in the description that it is better to enter the access to the river that is before the bridge, if not impossible!"
95162,442402,1,doolittle,20/03/2019,"About the area itself I can not comment, it was impossible to reach it. The access by the bridge is practically impossible, you can not turn without rubbing the vehicle with the walls of the bridge. The alternative access by the ramp to go down to the river bed is dangerous because of narrow and bad road, in addition there are usually parked vehicles blocking the passage to the ramp Ac unusable area with these accesses"
95162,441436,3,gon943,18/03/2019,"Accretable, level and gravel area. Without sufficient separation between faucets loading clean water and Poti rinse, it is not known which of the two is, so it is indifferent, I advise disinfecting the faucet spout with legia before plugging hose. The advice of access to the area as the presentation says is very useful. This town is worth visiting. Thanks Uncastillo."
95162,441159,1,davidfge,17/03/2019,"Impossible to go down to the river, for a badly parked car. Also at the end of the ramp were some steps. By the bridge with a large motorhome we did not try it. A pity because the town seems beautiful. We went somewhere else"
95162,436482,5,JuanP61,04/03/2019,"Hi Jesal, I have seen your comment and I am sorry about what happened, besides being from this village I have a motorhome and I thank you when I leave, that the areas do not create complications for us. I have contacted the town hall to see if it is possible to prevent a badly parked car from preventing access to the area. It is a beautiful villa that is worth visiting and I encourage you to do so!"
95162,427626,1,Jesal,08/02/2019,"FATAL. The Area we have not been able to see. We arrived at the town around 9 with the intention of parking and going for a walk around the town and have a drink, but we could not reach the area: just after leaving the river at the beginning of the street there was a parked car, an SUV dark that impeded the passage. We tried to pass, we found that we could not and we had to go backwards until we could turn around. The worst thing is that the owners were there, even a couple of teenagers at the door, and they did not bother to remove the car. Pity, because the town seems very beautiful!"
95162,419073,1,chivirina,02/01/2019,We had an AC of 8.6 mt and could not enter the river because there was a car parked and the bridge was impossible to turn. We stopped a little later jto. to the road where the route of the fountains begins.
95162,412785,5,kikebarreda,08/12/2018,Complicated accesses for the rest. Excellent area
95162,404679,4,anpifer,04/11/2018,"ATTENTION ATTENTION !, I do not know what happens to the turn in the bridge, I tried it and I took a refregón, besides it is very very complicated, with the help of the neighbors of Uncastillo they told me that the only way to access was as I said in the presentation, going down to the riverbed, at the tourist office and they told me that the Hydrographic Confederation does not let them signal it correctly."
95162,359148,3,Roel964,29/08/2018,"With a 2,3 meter wide camper you have to manoeuvre a bit to enter the small bridge, but not problematic. Large parking area close to a nice village.

We had trouble fitting the hose to fill the water because the mouth was larger than usual. Luckily they lent us a suitable adapter. It is paved but uneven. Good access is from Jaca. It is not recommended to go from Borao and much less from Echo. The town is very beautiful. We recommend visiting it!

Also if you are coming from F from the north on the N-330: Drive first to Jaca and then onto the A-2605. Then you have a very little-used, winding, sometimes narrow, beautiful country road.

95242,1755417,4,Thessis,13/02/2022,The area is very nice. Somewhat sloping but nothing that can't be leveled with shims. The only problem for me has been that there was no phone coverage. I have Orange. I don't know about other companies.
95242,1689426,5,quicoamador,14/11/2021,"You can get there from Jaca without problems, the road is in perfect condition, the parking is very good and has services, and the town is cool. Excursions can be made from the same AC area. Thanks for areas like this."
95242,1655769,4,asv84,21/10/2021,"Despite the small unevenness of the squares, the area is very well planned and cared for. The thing about the bells, if you are a light sleeper, with some earplugs it is fixed. The town without a doubt, and the entire valley, are worth the visit. Thanks to the city council of Aísa and the Provincial Council of Huesca for such initiatives."
95242,1635337,1,rocioherrepla,09/10/2021,"The access road is closed due to construction, the only access is crossing a small mountain village through which motorhomes do not enter, impossible to access on 10/09/2021"
95242,1627658,4,Betty2612,05/10/2021,Very pretty frankly a place to see except that it is better to plan your provisions before no bakery or grocery store at this time for other seasons honestly I do not know! in the meantime it is a quiet place to the rhythm of the village bells and the cows and we love it and also a big thank you to the municipality!
95242,1623863,5,AraleNoriMakina,03/10/2021,"Extraordinary area, for putting a small hit on the small incline, thanking the Aisa town hall for this area, a beautiful and charming town, I do not understand the complaints of some that if water that if bells, in short ......"

95242,1546462,5,amayasg,04/09/2021,The spectacular area ... is worth it for its tranquility ... but ... above all .. if you are going to have dinner or lunch ... do not be fooled .. the hostel igüer is a total scam .. € 25 we have paid for a menu that does not deserve more than € 12/15 ... better in the ac
95242,1540463,5,imar,02/09/2021,"Very well equipped area, quiet and beautiful place; the road a bit bad, thank you very much Aisa for taking care of it"

95242,1510786,4,el-zahori,25/08/2021,"The Area is very good, better than some of the payment. The surroundings and the town are very cool, I recommend the circular excursion from the Recreation Area to the campsite. IMPORTANT: in Aísa there is no grocery store or bakery, nor in the vicinity. You have to get provisioned."
95242,1501611,5,Anabsaiz,23/08/2021,"The area is wide with good services. For motorhomes, access the road from Jaca A-2605. The other access is not recommended for AC as it is a very narrow road."
95242,1494551,4,AventuraRutera,21/08/2021,"Very comfortable and wide, avoid by all means the Borau highway from Jaca. A beautiful town. Near the parking lot, following the road to Esposa, there is a little exercise park that at least served my little ones as a park to spend some time, as well as having a fountain."
95242,1488963,5,AmetsakOporrak,20/08/2021,"Free area. It does not have bathrooms but it does have discharge and water services. Well located. Perfect for one night. Recommend the restaurant of the hostel Igüer. Delicious food and spectacular attention. The town is small but beautiful. And the spectacular night sky. I do not think that the use that some people give to the fountain to collect water, such as doing laundry, for example. This way you get that they limit us to be in many areas."
95242,1482448,5,Juliaapa,19/08/2021,"Spectacular setting, surrounded by nature, very quiet place to spend the night, with gray and black emptying services. We spent one night with several campers and Acs. About the sound of the bells that some comments review, I did not find it at all annoying, since it is very faint in the background, I did not hear anything during the night. Only two bars in town, but very nice."
95242,1463443,5,Hectorvlc,15/08/2021,A highly recommended area. Free water and poti! Thank the people for the effort. We went to dinner at the Igüer Restaurant and dinner was spectacular. Do not let it escape. Lovely town !!
95242,1340634,3,Mandalorian,19/07/2021,"Clean and no shade. Quite steep. It is a shame the nocturnal tabarra of the bell tower; touch the quarters and hours twice, all of them. It is advisable to take ear plugs to be able to get some sleep ... there is no WC for the van, but there are water services for ACs. When we were there (Jul / 21) we couldn't get water from it because it smelled stinky."
95242,1334302,4,RamonFdez.,17/07/2021,"Ideal place to rest, there are very well signposted trails for hiking and the croquets and migas of the Hostal Iguer, are tremendous. We read that we had to go from Jaca and avoid going through Borau, but Google Maps took us from Jaca to Borau, so when you arrive in Jaca look for the A-2605 road"

There is no local trade, so bread comes on the road Tuesday and Friday, and Monday and Wednesday fruit, vegetables and fish. To take into account before coming .. Very quiet place. It is important to enter from Jaca and not from Borau since it is a 3 meter wide road."
95242,1248630,4,merialt,11/06/2021,"Very wide area, with two water intakes, and emptying of dirty water. The only downside is the unevenness. But thank the city council. from Aisa is created area. It is at the entrance of the town and is very quiet despite having the road next to it."

95242,1160657,5,EduardoLaviga,29/03/2021,Perfect site on the way between the valley of Hecho and Canfranc for emptying and filling. Or spend the night if you feel like it. Places like that are needed for vans. Very pretty town. thank you very much AISA

95242,812944,4,VanDame,31/05/2020,Excellent place to spend the night and get to know El Valle de Aísa. A free municipal area where you can load and unload water for free (Thank you !!). It would only lack a shadow to be flatly perfect
95242,786840,5,51dom,26/02/2020,"Indeed, slight slope. But no problem with calles. Water and drainage in February. Very clean place. Very calm. Certainly, there is the church bell, we love each other. Significantly less disturbing than the noise of surrounding cities. Do not hesitate to make about 20km to discover this very beautiful village. With restaurants and cafe."

95242,408070,3,tomstokes84,17/11/2018,"Very beautiful and peaceful. It's a newly created parking area with services. However, there are two waste drains but no specific ones so toilet waste is going down both. I presume then, people are using both taps to clean out their cassettes, which isn't ideal. Also, the taps have a large screw connector, which I don't have so couldn't fill up and they spurt everywhere. Just needs more thought."
95242,394173,4,rrojo,16/10/2018,New and very quiet area in a very nice village. With bar and restaurant nearby. Very close to the Igüerre valley. We spent a very quiet and silent night.

95271,3084425,4,JaviKa,05/08/2023,"Very quiet and cozy place. To sleep we saw it regular since it is attached to a national highway with traffic. For the rest, very well, the town has two bars, there are fountains, and next to the parking lot of the pool there are well-kept picnic areas. We cook at night and without problems with the people of the town, very friendly."
95271,2949603,4,Cano17,11/07/2023,A peaceful place. Without services but with sports courts and a well-kept park ideal for small children. The pool opens at 3pm every day in summer and until 12pm there is hardly any movement in the area.
