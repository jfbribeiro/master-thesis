94299,1075142,4,markd7,29/09/2020,Beautiful if you can get a flat spot as lots of rocks and quite busy. We got blocked in one night there were so many vans!. No services but peaceful if you have quiet neighbours.
94299,900015,5,Nanusere,26/07/2020,"There are two almost flat squares, the rest are not bad either but on land and with potholes. You have to wait for them to leave the beach to enter with a large vehicle or get up early. Beautiful views of the beach of maior area, Mount Loiro and the lagoon. An impressive sunrise. In a 5 min walk you are on the other beach."
94299,387263,4,Carmenrac,03/10/2018,A quiet place with very good views. Be careful if it is a very large vehicle. I do not think it fits.
94320,2887684,5,enbuscadelsol,24/06/2023,My favorite spot of the spots I've been to on the Almeria coast.
94320,2647791,5,alfonsopoveda,07/04/2023,"beautiful place, a 10, quiet, there are trash cans, remote, very spacious..."
94320,2573720,2,caddypunk,10/02/2023,Vehicles longer than 5m are not allowed on the gravel road that leads to the spot. Overnight stays are also forbidden. The sign saying that has been overpainted by campers but that won’t stop the police from putting fines. Almost no mobile network coverage.
94320,2544544,5,FranMarras,07/01/2023,"Beautiful beach, very calm. No signal. The restaurant with bathrooms is closed out of season. There is no shower, no water. Narrow road, but suitable for all types of medium and small vehicles. There are differentiated garbage cans for recycling, please respect!"

This place is nice but the photo is much nicer then reality."

94320,2515296,5,Freddifero,07/12/2022,"Marvelous. it seems difficult to get there but in reality the road can be traveled without problems the place is wonderful even if full of people who, as usual, do not respect the peace and silence that many go looking for in this kind of place."

94320,2490444,5,vanandco,11/11/2022,Lovely community of campers and vans here. We really enjoyed our stay.
94320,2483389,5,SalomePicot,05/11/2022,We spent 2 nights with our motorhome. Access a bit difficult my doable. There were other vehicles with us. It was great! Very nice place to relax and rest.
94320,2478036,4,delphinemarce,02/11/2022,"Magnificent view to reach this superb place. On the other hand, a very popular place for motorhomes and vans. Very rough sea difficult for swimming with young children. Naturist beach. We had a good night."
94320,2436357,4,obitravelstheworld,10/10/2022,"Very nice place overlooking the sea. Ideal for swimming, even if the waves are sometimes quite large. Great beach between rocks and mountains. The beach is also used by nudists. When we were there there were many dogs. We stayed two nights although there were many other campers. The driveway is beautiful and adventurous. There is a nice hike in the mountains. Unfortunately a lot of toilet paper."
94320,2424958,5,Larisari,05/10/2022,"Traveling with a dog and two small children: wonderful place. Please take everything back with you, including the toilet paper!!!! Is easily accessible for all vehicles"

94320,2382303,5,alisha97,18/09/2022,"One of the best places of our trip. Were there in December and met super nice people. Internet is only available at the top of the mountain, which makes it even nicer to relax."
94320,2373228,5,Baitlers,15/09/2022,as beautifully described a beautiful place. It was even used as a film backdrop. Spent a lovely evening in good company and a great day right on the beach
94320,2363458,5,bella090620,12/09/2022,Beautiful place to spend the day at the beach and stay the night. We didn't see any police. At 8 a.m. only the garbage cans were emptied. Have stood there with about 6 other campers. Super beautiful sunrise. Please keep the place clean!!
94320,2339543,5,Cachorrita,04/09/2022,one of the most beautiful places where I have slept. the road is along a narrow track but with a van it is good. very little coverage. several campers to spend the night.
94320,2308727,5,swag74330,27/08/2022,Many vehicles but still space. Very calm. Magnificent night with the sound of the sea + swimming on waking. No shade.
94320,2273883,5,avegas88,20/08/2022,"Good place to spend the night. Calm and accompanied by other campers. We did it without problem in August. Little level site, it will be normal to have to fit. Somewhat complicated road to get there, but worth it"
94320,2273852,5,juanpolo,20/08/2022,Great site and very quiet on the beachfront. We spent the night without problem in August 2022 in the company of other campers and without police presence. The terrain is slightly sloping and it is necessary to wedge.
94320,2116457,5,MariaIglesias12,24/07/2022,"Incredible, it looks like a natural park between mountains and beaches with crystal clear turquoise water. Then it's so quiet and clean depending on the neighbors who touch you x)"
94320,1832001,5,KyraTappe,17/04/2022,"The police aren't coming by at the moment (yet), it's great to stand here! Mostly locals, lots of dogs!"
94320,1821754,4,Kobold29,14/04/2022,"A magically beautiful place. When it rained, we put our plants outside and forgot them there. Hopefully they find a new owner. The road was narrow, we were a bit scared to come back when it rained, so we left prematurely. But indescribably beautiful there, really!!!"
94320,1757320,5,TobisDoblo,16/02/2022,Great space for vehicles under 5m. Please stick to the length limit so that the place will not be closed to everyone soon.
94320,1752435,1,luzifuer,10/02/2022,the police often come by and send people away under threat of fines. So no place to stay!
94320,1745643,3,onberijkbaar,01/02/2022,beautiful but got send away by the police. Vehicle >5m are not allowed to park on the waterfront near Mojicar
94320,1724073,1,kurtlouis,02/01/2022,"The access is forbidden for vehicles over 5 meters in length and definitely not recommended! The path is very narrow and steep in sections. When two larger mobiles meet, things get interesting. Dear owners of larger vehicles: obey the ban so that this beautiful place is not soon banned for people with more modest cars!"
94320,1711039,2,EGPH,16/12/2021,"I honestly did not understand how large campers got there as the access road narrows inexorably and we, with our camper of not even 7m, did not dare to pass."
94320,1700274,5,MarisaBonmati,29/11/2021,"We had a fabulous night, the terrain is quite flat AND it is very quiet. There are bins for recycling. It is a naturist beach. The walks and the scenery is spectacular. Worth."
94320,1687439,5,onefootinthecave,13/11/2021,More space and less uneven here than in the other bay. Clean and maintained with plenty of bins. Great for dogs
94320,1641557,5,dacmail,12/10/2021,"Good site, a few meters from the water, and quite level, there are signs forbidden to park vehicles of more than 5m"
94320,1629520,5,Pippivan,06/10/2021,"Just a dream! Spent the night here and find it hard to leave. Direct access to the sea, rubbish bins available and somehow in nowhere. The access is via a longer, somewhat narrow gravel road, where larger mobile homes are a disadvantage."
94320,1616592,5,lion917,29/09/2021,The best spot we have ever done! saw amazing crystal clear sea. we passed without problem with our 6 meter cc. beware the beach is naturist.
94320,1598516,5,BigMountainSki,22/09/2021,Spent lovely night here at the end of September.
94320,1557513,1,Josecar1,07/09/2021,Hard access. a lot of control by the police what happens constantly and
94320,1527852,5,druizben,29/08/2021,"Very top place! We have been two nights and no sign of the authorities. We have met many camper and AC's, good vibes, nude beach and animal friendly. Inside the natural park it is very difficult to spend the night in high season, a very good option to the north of the park"
94320,1518799,5,DadouCahu,27/08/2021,"Ideal setting to spend the night on the beach, absolute calm, we were 3 vehicles for the night (2 van and a roof tent)."
94320,1515990,4,criscaro,26/08/2021,"During the day a lot of car and camper. But at night, we spend the night super quietly. The place says it is not suitable for vehicles over 6m including cargo. The road to get there is very narrow and dirt."
94320,1494361,5,Montheroad,21/08/2021,"We were coming for one night and in the end We have spent two perfect nights here. More or less level terrain. Quite a few campers and some AC. Very good atmosphere, quiet to sleep with the windows open, which is appreciated by the Almeria heat. There are several trails to go with incredible views. Naturist space. Dogs welcome on the beach. Remember to pick up what you mess up!"
94320,1432416,4,samildanach,10/08/2021,"Very nice spot with this beautiful cove and the small parking lot facing the sea, access is a bit complicated in places with a large but doable motorhome. We came with a 7.30m. Lots of people during the day but quiet at night. ""Free"" beach with a lot of diversity, Family with children, locals like Vanniste Punk à chien. . . No problem to spend the night."
94320,1369768,5,xav05,27/07/2021,Great spot with a little too many people for my taste. But definitely worth the detour. We had a perfect night.
94320,1249752,4,Potami,12/06/2021,Spent two nights in this beautiful place without incident. Oncoming traffic on the street below is better if you don't want to have a big vehicle :)
94320,1246952,1,HansClever,10/06/2021,"Camping is currently no longer tolerated. The police or Guardia Civil have been checking every day since Easter and requesting that you continue your journey. They want to keep the beach free for the locals. This is understandable, because some campers have exaggerated their furniture in front of the door. After the season, it looks better again. Unfortunately, the locals also shut everything down!"
94320,1220841,5,Goarden,27/05/2021,"Beautiful beach. The driveway is a bit adventurous, but it's definitely worth it!"
94320,1204661,4,eirelav22,18/05/2021,Beautiful and peaceful place.. Fkk is possible. Police ist looking around twice a day. Don't shit everywhere
94320,1159093,2,UltraCaddy,28/03/2021,"Seems that authorities have lost patience. Since a couple of weeks police comes by regularly and makes clear that overnight stay is not permitted, independent of use of tables etc. 

Anyways it leaves a bad taste to see refugees landing here (happens regularly) while Europeans enjoy the beach ..."
94320,1133929,5,HansClever,30/01/2021,"The ""dark figures"" are very nice Italians who have collected firewood. Broken glass is nowhere around and it's a very nice community here in the bay. Drug boats don't land here, but now and then refugees. No tables and chairs in front of the car! The police don't like that !!!"
94320,1133716,1,BulliT3-88,29/01/2021,Nice place but everywhere there are broken glass from mobile panes there are also many dark figures walking around in the bushes. In the evening boats with drug couriers also came. I drove on quickly in the evening.
94320,1131569,5,stefansmink,18/01/2021,"Great place! The last kilometer towards this spot is a tricky ride, but this is manageable with a van or camper and definitely worth it."
94320,1130693,5,kieranandalice,15/01/2021,Really nice spot. Only a little phone signal
94320,1128841,5,hponwheels,07/01/2021,"Magnificent place !! To all of you who go without a bathroom in the van, please pick up your shit and the papers! There are enough containers !! I've been there a long time and I'll be back !! Keep it clean please !!"
94320,1123873,5,Elstim,25/12/2020,"One of the most beautiful spots we visited in Spain! Part of the movie ""Treasure Island"" would have been shot there. Very limited mobile network."

94320,1120553,5,BenCampervan,10/12/2020,Great spot to stay. Good to stay the weekend but be aware of older people how stay here for a longer time. They might get grumpy if you play music after 21:30....
94320,1112463,5,argodak,05/11/2020,"This place is amazing, many campers stay there for days/weeks. very secluded, basically a wild beach surrounded by hills, great views and hicking opportunities if you climb the hills."
94320,1073578,5,lalabadou,28/09/2020,Quiet place surrounded by nature with a beautiful beach. Magnificent stone path to access it. One of our best spots in Andalusia.
94320,1054666,5,paugc88,17/09/2020,"A very very beautiful place. The waves of the sea, the breeze and a lot of tranquility. There were 2 AC and a van. There are no services, but there are several containers. 100% recommendable"
94320,994012,4,marivigs,23/08/2020,"A very nice site! The sea and the sound of the waves. Several Furgo a. We spent the night without problems, very calm. In the morning the local police pass by, without problems but they do not allow camping."

94320,843612,4,viajeconosotros,01/07/2020,"Be careful with the entrance track. Large caravans and vans can be seen in trouble on some stretch due to the narrowness or if they cross another vehicle. Please, collect the garbage, there are several containers, here you have no excuses."
94320,792829,5,poletex,08/03/2020,Great
94320,751263,4,BlueSuperVan,08/12/2019,Super good spot. We had a very quiet night. Access road a bit bumpy/hilly and maybe not accessible for the bigger motorhomes. No problem for our 5.5m sprinter/LT van.
94320,736303,4,Jmnhh,02/11/2019,"Very narrow gravel road, not for the faint of heart! But if you have made the first 300m after the roundabout or the small beach bar, things are better. The place is beautiful, only the flies are unbearable on the motorhome during the day. Okay on the beach. We were there 2 nights (motorhome 7m length). Guardia Civil drove past once a day without stopping."
94320,425311,2,Geoffo1,28/01/2019,"Went down this track, it is not for the faint hearted very difficult drive and do not attempt with vehicle over 6m. Nice when you get there but once you are committed there’s no turning back. My wife wouldn’t stay in the vehicle whilst I drove down and bottomed the vehicle several times. Never again, I recommend for vans only at a push. Civil challenged us twice: no chairs or camping equipment at all!!!"
94320,424998,5,vtttof,27/01/2019,"Very quiet and with a great view. Passages of the civil guard and no worries out of season, as long as one respects the places (barbecue to put away). Access track in good condition, maybe difficult by camper (there were 2 during my stay). Not too many flat places, ideal to have holds."

94328,2238304,4,Gurguma,14/08/2022,"Very correct, clean showers and €3/person. In addition, they offer ample parking, cafeteria-restaurant. A good stop-&-go. In addition, a few meters away there is a very convenient lowcost gas station!"

94348,512410,4,theroverlanders,11/06/2019,It’s a gravel track with over hanging branches for about 1.5 km from the park. Our Land Rover Defender made it and it was worth it but parking is tight as it’s still a road in use. Very quiet night though

Everything is lovingly designed. - the crowing of the roosters starts at 4:30 a.m. winter time - there are a lot of houseflies (it's a farm after all!) - if the many pitches are full, it could be tight with just one toilet and one shower"

The hosts, Josep and his wife are very kind and you can ask things if you need something. There is also a market nearby (500m). At night you might hear some cars on the road and in the morning you might hear the animals on the farm. It’s a great place to stay when you’re doing a roadtrip!"
94408,2324018,2,jabos,31/08/2022,"Nice idea, just not suitable for us. Guided in fine by phone. Two caravans permanently inhabited by somewhat vague people.

94408,1769614,5,fdc00050,28/02/2022,"excellent, do not miss it really. It is a farm as indicated in the name. perfect for children with animals they have a great time. And for those of us who are no longer so young, being woken up by the rooster is a luxury in these times. Surroundings to ride a spectacular bike. Getting to Estartit in the morning by bike and having a good beer on the beach is priceless."

As soon as the night falls, everything becomes calm again, only the noise of the air conditioners of the cardboard factory next to the farm. You are only 1 km from the historic center, some pitches are covered on the twenties available. An excellent welcome from Joseph the farmer owner. 1 shower and a toilet available on this area.

Josep showed me around, helped me get the van leveled with some extra blocks, gave me a map with walking and cycling routes,... When leaving he asked how he could improve the place (like leveling out some of the parking spots) and got to it 10mins later! There are some cute donkeys on the farm, super friendly animals and they really didn’t make that much noise so perfect as well. The farm is perfectly situated to hike up the mountain to the Castell de Montgrí and go see the amazing views of L’Estartit and de Illes Medes; from here you can also see L’Escala/Roses/... and the snowy mountaintops.

94433,332316,5,Marikilla_jajaja,14/08/2018,"Without services, some unevenness, we have spent a single night, very centric but quiet place in a typical town Sevilla, to eat in the bars very cheap, friendly and friendly people."
94434,3233152,4,Salabertfamily,29/08/2023,"Quiet and flat place in the middle of nature, accessible by an easily passable path, possibility of swimming, we were alone and slept very well! Too bad there's a lot of waste. There is room for several vans or vans."
94434,3146721,5,altchouss,14/08/2023,"Little corner of paradise, very pleasant swimming...only downside, the others who defecate everywhere leaving soiled toilet paper hanging on the branches close to the water...the surprise of the morning when you wake up. ...honestly pack in a bag or go to a campsite if you're not able to use a shovel!"
94434,2487237,3,Fredpsq,08/11/2022,"Helps out well in the area. Flat with room, relatively far from the road that you can hear a little. Nothing extraordinary but with the merit of being in the middle of nature."

94434,2259377,4,odawg,18/08/2022,Quiet spot 30m from the river. We were alone in this barely remote place. A lot of flat space for several vans. The path is quite narrow but safe.
94434,2098068,4,mrbruno,20/07/2022,"very surprising spot, the access is rather reminiscent of a post-industrial area but if you are lucky enough to go to the last location 10 meters from the river and be there alone you will be the kings of the world. Lots of small fish and American red crayfish."
94434,1990319,3,wahooh64,19/06/2022,"Car park with 27 spaces, therefore on principle very practical since access to the river is a few hundred meters below. The place is superb and therefore very popular."
94434,1969668,4,Helenemarie31,12/06/2022,"Place without immense charm and a lot of waste but big advantage of having direct access to the river. The proximity of Alquezar and the park of the sierra de guara is also a big plus since it is forbidden to sleep there, it is a good base for going back and forth during the day The land is large and flat and it's easy to find a place in the shade"
94434,636802,3,popycam,17/08/2019,"Nice spot but dirty ... people are not respectful and leave pq, butts, cans etc. It's a shame ..."
94434,626776,4,Romie85,14/08/2019,"Very nice spot at the edge of the river, arriving from Alquezar before the metal bridge and the entrance of Pozán de Vero small dirt road that goes down. Possibility to go to the end to be closer to the water but with 2 trucks one slept on a slope, so small plateau just above flatter. Very calm and pleasant"

94446,2859267,5,LouieHassett,16/06/2023,"Still a tiny bit unsure if campervans are actually allowed here because of some ambiguous signage - but had no problems staying for a night. We interpreted the signs to mean that it was no campers beyond the point they were plaxed at - in which case these spaces are fine.

Only ones here, great terrain, bit of wildlife. Calm spot."
94446,2359463,3,CristinaGR2,10/09/2022,"Nice and quiet place. The downside, the picnic areas were not in the shade and on a hot day like today it has been impossible for us to eat there. There are bathrooms."

We were the only ones to spend a night there, if it is true that there are signs everywhere saying that it is prohibited, but it was late and we stayed. a very quiet night to wake up in a spectacular place. It has bathrooms and a picnic area, although the water may not work... The parking lot is next to the road."
94446,1830709,5,Reissaustajaruokaa,17/04/2022,"Lots of parking slots next to the paved road. We were there on Easter Friday and there was lots of cars, people come there to walk around the lake. Overnight there was only 3 vans. Good place for dogs. You may have picnic in the shade next to the parking. There were toilets and drinking water available. Road there was paved, but a bit narrow so you need to watch for cars coming from opposite dir."
94446,1716611,5,tamaraydavid,27/12/2021,the views of the lake and the site itself are spectacular. there is a sign that prohibits entering with caravans on the lake road but we did not see any sign that prohibits parking in the parking lot. sleep one night with no problem.

94446,967449,4,Atiflows,15/08/2020,The walk through the reservoir 100% recommended. The parking is slightly inclined and there is no light in the toilet. Very quiet place to spend the night. Swimming in the reservoir is prohibited and is very dangerous.
94446,848584,5,eiderishu,04/07/2020,"Very quiet place, more than I imagined, since there is movement of people / cars from around 9:30 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. and several motorhomes at night.

When we arrived in the evening, almost all the parking spaces were occupied by cars, but at 9 pm only 5 mobile phones remained. The path around the lake is worthwhile (7km), only a swimming opportunity is missing."
94446,663954,5,zmendoza,28/08/2019,"Super quiet, wake up facing the mountain, accompanied by a peaceful pony! Country!"
94446,633677,3,celinec,16/08/2019,"For one night we stayed at the 1st car park opposite Bird Observatory; it seemed to us quieter. Superb lake tour, to do."
94446,552523,4,mikelisasi,14/07/2019,Quiet site where hardly any cars pass. It has some inclination but nothing exaggerated. It has bathrooms and fountains. We have spent a very quiet night.
94446,462204,4,Christnnne,21/04/2019,"Great place to stop for a break! There were several people on a Sunday in April, but there is plenty of room. Nice place to stop with children. Enough space to walk / play. WCs did not look fresh."
94448,2230301,4,traficsylae,13/08/2022,"superb place. lots of vans and CC's. beautiful beaches. but in the dunes, a lot of toilet papers... pick up your papers damn it!!! it's not very heavy. Show civility and respect for nature and people. By dint of dirtying nature, places like these will no longer be accessible."
94448,1103814,2,blaiseetvero,24/10/2020,Access for all sizes BUT very sloping. Permanent traffic all night long just a break from 2 to 4 hours in the morning and all at the end of October! The beach below is superb but it is strictly forbidden to stay there. Well in troubleshooting to sleep. Nice to spend the day.
94448,862903,1,nai88,12/07/2020,"You cannot park at night as it is a Natural Park. The police came at 6.30 in the morning with the sirens and they vacated the parking lot, they warned us that they were going to put fines next week"
94448,742102,1,TheBalls,12/11/2019,This is a lovely spot amongst the tall pine trees BUT there’s a lot of cars circling around in the dark - flashing lights and doing all sorts of weird things. We wanted to move on but it was late and very wet and windy so we pulled down the blinds and ignored the activity outside. Creepy .....
94448,567800,1,Talitres,21/07/2019,"Same, we went and then left, strange atmosphere, not clean. We preferred the spot close to the beach"
94448,555070,2,DCB-SUBITZA,15/07/2019,"Parking with a lot of slope (little flat area) and without services. At night cars circulate inside the parking lot ... Better to go to Liencres to sleep, which is 2 minutes away."

94448,446635,4,galotrofico,30/03/2019,"Pinar very cool and you can walk around, good alternative to the parking that is closer to the beach"
94448,438638,3,sam'plais,10/03/2019,The GPS point entered two parking lots. The first being in the woods and the second next to the beach. That of the beach is forbidden to the camper but tolerates out of season
94448,367488,1,fafavril,07/09/2018,"Parking certainly very beautiful but strange atmosphere with cars that spend every minute with no other motorhome or van around, we flew"
94448,349546,5,Burbujita,23/08/2018,Quiet and beautiful place to sleep and rest. There are many places although few are flat.

94459,2432027,5,krusa,08/10/2022,"Perfect for standing. If there is no space, there is a meadow on the other side to stand on. But sometimes they ask for money."
94459,2178773,5,Summersurf,05/08/2022,"Super during the day, unfortunately not allowed at night and when you leave (after 8 p.m., at the beginning of July) it is still very full. Meadows next door cost about 3 euros per day."
94459,2028117,5,Purem,01/07/2022,Magnificent beach to see absolutely. Day parking only as mentioned in previous reviews.
94459,1960363,5,armintanzanian,09/06/2022,", it is an idyllic place to sleep and to surf, I have been going there for 5 years, at the end of the street you will find a very small parking lot in the same roundabout to turn around, it is free you can spend there as long as you want as long as you respect, In a field right next to it, a family has set up a parking lot for €1/day to spend the day at the beach, a very good option if you are just passing through."
94459,1795929,2,camimi,26/03/2022,"Unfortunately, access to the beach is blocked. Nothing special to see anymore"
94459,1727893,5,julmartinezp,06/01/2022,"Spectacular views. You can see the cliffs and the beach. Being low season we found parking without problem, I suppose that in summer it will be collapsed. It is very worth it. You can go down to the beach by some stairs. All green and very spacious, perfect if you have a dog."
94459,1461248,1,ribamontano,15/08/2021,This place has been abused for years. With ac spending the night many days in a row. Right now sanctions and they get you up at night. Outside of high season you can safely spend a night without incident. There are no services of any kind.
94459,1393183,5,quentinenloes,02/08/2021,Very nice place to stay. It is forbidden to spend the night. So do not show any signs of camping such as tables and chairs.
94459,1280299,5,clemyenvan,27/06/2021,"The favorite of our stay. A beautiful little field where we were 6 or 7 vans in June. Langre beach is superb, with the possibility of surfing, swimming and hiking. No water point."
94459,1065128,3,wanillo,23/09/2020,There was no place to park and we parked a few meters before on the land of a private individual who charges € 5 to AC and cannot stay overnight. Very nice beach.
94459,1063234,2,KeyserSoze,21/09/2020,"Superb beach indeed but a spot squatted by surfers' vans. There is space next to it in private pay parking, but not allowed at night. We therefore did not stay."
94459,1057539,5,mayfer,19/09/2020,"Undoubtedly the most beautiful beach in the world .... very small parking without services, very quiet and with spectacular views.There is a nice walk that communicates langre with two other beaches, loredo, and galizano you go through the top cliffs a beauty of landscape"
94459,1051261,3,Rafabi,15/09/2020,"Large parking lot where you can stand for 2.50 € until 9 p.m., not overnight. However, further ahead on the road there were about five campers (estimated at no charge). We were only there during the day, the beach is very beautiful but also well attended."
94459,1035563,4,pedroalvares,08/09/2020,Very good location specially for surfers! There is not a lot of parking spaces...
94459,1020001,4,laflacavan,01/09/2020,"Good views. Next to two silvers. The parking lot fills up. There is a house next door, but we had no problem. The police come around 11:30 pm and in the morning around 9-10. He said nothing, I suppose they will attract attention in the case of being camped."
94459,1010738,5,csugranes04,28/08/2020,"Spectacular beach, very nice views from the front line car parks. Camping forbidden but the police passed or they didn't tell us anything."
94459,1000343,5,SybilVane,25/08/2020,"Spectacular view. You can stay overnight without problems if you don't raise the roof. The Civil Guard passes once at night and once in the morning, but they are out for a walk, they don't stop if everything is fine. AC and vans. I recommend."
94459,998479,3,familiaIglesias,24/08/2020,"Parking with access to two beaches, if you manage to park it is fine to spend a night, not allowed to raise the facts, no service .."
94459,983028,4,leribea,20/08/2020,Nice place with access to 2 spectacular beaches. Few places but if you can park in one it is a very good place. There is a field that they open as a paid parking only during the day. We have spent two days without problem. We were badly parked on the yellow line from the end of the marked spaces until the entrance of the parking lot but it was always full and nobody told us anything.
94459,975613,3,patungui,17/08/2020,"We went with a van and a roof tent, at 11:00 p.m. the police came and made us lower the roof :( luckily we were able to sleep inside the van ... Maybe if we put the roof up later they wouldn't catch us ... (to take into account) There are caravans, vans and cars .... Perhaps you would have to ask each town hall what is happening ... Xq in Sopelana we had no problems."
94459,965791,3,Mathieuzuzu,15/08/2020,"Very nice place with 2 nearby beaches and hiking trails along beautiful cliffs. Limited number of places. The police passed around midnight and made the vehicles leave that were not parked in real spaces, no problem for the others. Friday night: Lots of coming and going during the night (vehicle parking, music, noise)."
94459,960274,2,Sheali,13/08/2020,"A splendid view of the 2 beaches (surfing and swimming) BUT the places are very expensive! If you see one, take it. Slight slope therefore wedges are recommended. no convenience no shower, no toilet, no water so plan ahead. The surfers of the nearby beach stagnate there and the other parking indicated on park4night is only valid during the day until 10 p.m. impossible to sleep there, too bad the spot is perfect. We have a pop-up roof it was recommended to us by others to lower it by indicating to us that the guardia passed around midnight and asked the holders of pop-up roof to lower them it is too camping. Given the comments on the campsites in the area, we prefer to sleep there. Many fishermen disembark late at night at the Spanish lol 22h. We don't know what time they will be leaving :-) we'll tell you tomorrow!"
94459,942315,5,Rouss_to,09/08/2020,"A beautiful place .. we were lucky to park overlooking the sea !! lovely wake up .. quiet place, we slept in our van. down stairs access to the beach. highly recommended place."
94459,854300,4,jonathanmartinezgomez,07/07/2020,"An impressive viewpoint with access to two beaches, there is no indication that you cannot stay overnight. An incredible sunrise. In the morning the local police passed by, they wrote down license plates and sent a roof down to a van, I hope that no fine will come."

94459,678901,4,bellamo,06/09/2019,"Awesome view, stayed overnight. Unfortunately no toilet. Guardia civil patrolled at around 22h and around 9h ish but didn’t even got out of the car and left."
94459,605613,5,Miranda3lm,07/08/2019,Beautiful place to spend the day and night. You can not camp but when we were there were several campers and motorhomes. Super recommended!
94459,583819,1,esencia,29/07/2019,"The place in the photo belongs to a meadow or something similar that Saturday, July 27, was closed. Without the meadow there is no place but to park cars"
94459,570001,4,carreteraymantras,23/07/2019,"Magical place with incredible views and two beaches next door. The police pass daily but if you don't have a raised roof and tables / chairs outside they say nothing, just let them know. I recommend arriving late last day is full. There are no bathrooms."
94459,343905,1,alexandry06,19/08/2018,Great place and magical beach however beware the civil guardia is around. They release us for the sole reason that we had a vw with an enhancement. So considered as campers! The height.
94459,343471,2,Mkawick,19/08/2018,"Very small free parking, no convenience. We have hardly found a place. Passage of the guardia in the early morning: ""no no camping, es parking"". Repacking the table to join the pay parking next door, about 1 km (€ 3 car, € 5 truck per day). Beach below is forbidden to animals."
94483,3179540,4,cochecitolere,19/08/2023,"Perfect place to spend the night with views of the boats. I don't give it 5 stars because of the humidity that is logically generated and because of the smell, which although I have seen bad comments, it is bearable, you get used to it quickly. 100% recommended for one night."
94483,2255918,5,esoler,17/08/2022,"We spent one night, very quiet, quite a few vans, the only place in that area that still allows the night. In the morning it fills up with cars visiting Santoña. Nice sunset."
94483,2214832,2,JEAN-LUCC66,11/08/2022,"A place with an annoying smell (heat?) and quite noisy early in the morning on weekdays, but where it is still possible to sleep there."
94483,1952193,4,Mirentzu,06/06/2022,"We slept the night there. Around 5am there was noise from people working in the area, but then it calmed down and we slept very comfortably. Very nice views and generally quiet area."
94483,1939682,3,frannetpat,02/06/2022,At the water's edge . Quieter than the other places offered in Santona.
94483,1829771,2,jdthdm,17/04/2022,We slept better on the road that leads to the canneries. During the night there was quite a lot of movement of cars coming and going. 30 m later you sleep better.
94483,1653152,4,lyndavincent,19/10/2021,Very quiet at the edge of the water not very far from the center. no service. passage for sinners. for one night.

94483,1497467,4,chemacrespo6,22/08/2021,"Good place to sleep if you find a hole in the green area, the rest of the area is fine but not as beautiful. Sunset is a wonder to enjoy. Enough AC and Camper, no services nearby, but Muncipal Hostel 3 minutes by car and unlimited hot shower for € 1.23 in a very clean bathroom."

94483,981839,3,jch600,19/08/2020,"To stop and rest and if you want to stay the night. Relatively quiet although there is a very busy industrial park street on the side. It is right next to the waste station and treatment plant as well as the fish canneries, which can make it smell bad if the wind comes from that side. Landscaped area with trash and various garbage. There are good views of the bay and the parked boats."

94483,948778,1,Alcasanc,10/08/2020,"Do not go !! next to a ""clean"" point, surrounded by garbage. We stopped to eat and it has been the most indigestible food of my life, the smell of rotten fish came with every breath of wind. disgusting. On top of that, the police passed by looking for ""prey"" to be fined."
94483,942402,3,luchigg,09/08/2020,"Site on the outskirts of a polygon. Sometimes cars pass and there are fishermen but otherwise it is a quiet place to sleep, nobody is disturbed. From time to time it smells like fish but inside the van it is not noticeable. A bit dirty from the remains of the clean spot next door. It has beautiful views of the boats."
94483,848573,4,elneno,04/07/2020,"Good and quiet place for large ac, no space problems. Not like in Santoña that is more complicated to circulate"
94483,843307,2,Eternoviajero,30/06/2020,"We spent a terrible night, noise of fishermen, at dawn, kids screaming from the bottle, and if you go out to dinner and you have to return at night through the bad vibes."

94483,642496,4,canglez,19/08/2019,This is a perfect and quiet place both to visit Santoña and to spend the night. It is a street where there is enough space for many motorhomes. There are no services. I know the area well and this is the best place for us.

Poorly defined plots, you have to cross some to get out. A scam, paying for very poor services or that they do not offer. nothing recommended"
94488,1632990,1,gargante,08/10/2021,"I agree with Manuel Ávila's comment, we have not been able to use showers or services due to a total lack of cleanliness and conditions. the website of the campsite indicates a different place from the one that is located, really creating different expectations total € 22 motorhome 2 people without light and the same services as if we were on the street."

Very noisy, lots of cars until late and to top it off a construction site at 8 in the morning with its hammer is not an idyllic sunrise. Small and pleasant beach of stones and sand, at high tide only stones. Waves and many surfers. Access road a bit complicated."
94520,3287087,4,DrJuki,12/09/2023,A good campsite for €20 for two people + pitch without electricity. Employees are nice. Places are quite narrow and without separation. Each place has its own sink with cold water. The campsite is difficult to find with a navigation system/Google Maps. From Laredo just follow the signs! The toilet paper hangs on the outside of the toilets... the place isn't exactly the nicest.

94520,2985151,4,VeravdDungen,18/07/2023,beautiful campsite with plane trees. all but a few pitches are in the shade. friendly hostesses and a security guard on an electric scooter at night. plumbing is very neat!. enough playgrounds. center and sea is 15 minutes walk. quite pricey for us (2 adults 3 children camper van and electricity) 40 euros per night. silence between 24:00-8:00 is well observed.
94520,2983429,3,carpunto,18/07/2023,Very nice and clean... be careful with the GPS that sends you to the polygon and leads you down a sandy path... it's better to call for directions
94520,2948052,5,MJCC1919,10/07/2023,"Great campsite and impeccable conditions. Plenty of shade, dishwashers in all plots, barbecues and tables available. Super clean bathrooms. It has a grocery store and restaurant, a playground and is well located."
94520,2911677,4,marsuma7,01/07/2023,"Modest-sized campsite at the end of the natural area of the Santoña marshes. In the estuary and 15 minutes from the great beach of Laredo. Equestrian centers 5 minutes away. Large and shaded but not delimited pitches, with sink and water connection. Clean bathrooms with excellent showers. Barbecues and picnic tables. Loading and unloading area for motorhomes not well designed."
94520,2845868,5,FamilieKuster,12/06/2023,"Excellent campsite in the midst of wonderful nature, ideal for everyone who just wants to enjoy themselves. Everything is there, what you need, swimming in the estuary (only at high tide), on foot in 1/4 hour on the huge beach of Laredo."
94520,2844034,5,IreW,11/06/2023,"Very well-equipped campsite with all services: super clean showers and toilets, well-defined plots, no night noises that favor rest. The staff is very friendly and they help you in any way possible. They allow pets and have a free lavacan. It is located in a very beautiful environment with the estuary at the foot of the campsite. Definitely a place to return to."

94520,2839848,4,Niblar,10/06/2023,"Campsite absolutely ok, no privacy but large plots and shade from trees. Swimming possible on the banks of the estuary, 15 minutes to the sea and 30-40 minutes to the ""old town"". Somehow we expected something different from the comments. In any case, we wouldn't stay longer - there are more scenic spots. Nevertheless, everything fits, maybe we expected / saw too much."
94520,2833578,5,Romy1306,08/06/2023,"Very nice campsite. Fairly big pitches with trees to give you shade. Great facilities all working beautifully. Did not use shop nor cafe. Acsi €19 well worth it!
Town not too great but pleasant enough but superb long sandy beach along campsite."
94520,2829955,3,Apester2000,07/06/2023,"The campsite is perfectly fine, maybe even a little too well structured. The place attached is reminiscent of a Spanish version of Timmendorfer Strand"
94520,2827161,5,isabelllaaa,06/06/2023,"Busy at weekends despite low season. But also spontaneously got a parking space with a sea view. Small supermarket available, filling and unloading station for campers available. Sanitary facilities simple but clean."
94520,2815218,5,SiegfriedUndBablin,03/06/2023,"Great facility. Ideal orientation to watch sunsets. Some GPS don't seem to know that there is paved access. They issue a corresponding warning and guide you over real sandy tracks. So don't blindly trust the GPS, just follow the signs."
94520,2812203,5,BerndHarbrecht,02/06/2023,a super great place with everything that goes with it. with access to the water when there is no low tide.
94520,2810190,5,Gabyvoyages,01/06/2023,"We spent 2 great nights in this very welcoming campsite, very clean, very quiet despite some crowds. Lots of walks to do around, dogs really welcome and spoiled (delicacy offered on arrival and shower equipped for rinsing after swimming!…) On-site catering not expensive and very correct. We will come back."
94520,2809227,4,cage,01/06/2023,"Place has all you need. Well equipped and a mini market and Restaurant if you need. Good sanitary, no working Wifi, unclear grey water disposal. The way the pitches are distributed needs improvement. All spots were filled pitch by pitch and it’s very close to the next camper. Could be spread better if the camp site is not full. Felt like a high season parking whilst there were enough free pitches"
94520,2793818,5,Schwheinz,28/05/2023,"Very nice place, very clean sanitary area, nice staff. Located right on the beach with great sunsets. Beautiful bike tours and the pretty old town with good bars and restaurants are not far away. We felt very comfortable."

Unfortunately, the approach is very irritating, because my navigation system did not find the street indicated and the coordinates are not correct. At some point we were standing in a dirt road.

94520,2720566,4,HaraldMeisel,03/05/2023,"Campsite absolutely good there is nothing to criticize (see previous reviews) but Laredo is like a ghost town at this time of year, hardly a restaurant is open, no supermarket, almost no life, just countless streets with empty high-rise blocks... actually quite frightening"
94520,2712989,5,Taxaner,01/05/2023,"Beautiful campsite right on the water. Almost all pitches under trees. At times when it is busy, it is better to reserve in advance. Everything neat and clean. Sanitary facilities modern and clean. Washing machines and dryers available. staff very friendly. For us 5 stars. PS The restaurant is not that good. It's enough for a coffee or beer. The WLAN/Wifi is not particularly good."

94520,2434664,4,JanL.,10/10/2022,"Good warm showers but shower heads could use descaling. Lots of trees, so good in summer, but impractical for a lifting roof or satellite system. Food in the restaurant okay but nothing special, but very friendly. The beach at the mouth of the river smells a bit at low tide, but the large beach is very nice if you don't look at the buildings. Walk about 25 minutes or 45 minutes at the river beach."

94520,2394289,5,SallyBarry,22/09/2022,Excellent washing areas very clean..exceptionally clean .Shady pretty area with many trees. 10 min walk into town..not much to see in town but there are restaurants..Next to sea and nice vista but not really for swimming..more of an estuary than a swimming beach. Good stop if travelling from ferry in Bilbao.
94520,2394214,5,ConorQ,22/09/2022,"Perfect camp site, probably our favourite during our trip. Very nice, big pitches and great facilities. it's quite far away from the beach (the western side of the estuary isn't really suitable for swimming) and it's quite far away from Laredo old town but otherwise can't complain"
94520,2388776,5,Albertayler,20/09/2022,Very calm. Very friendly staff. We spent 2 days in superb Laredo and Santoña. The small boat that crosses Laredo Santoña accepts bicycles. Have a good stay.

Direct beach is okay, unfortunately a lot of rubbish here and there because it wasn't cleaned by the city. The other beach can be reached by bike in 5 minutes and is very beautiful. Good place for families. recommendation"

94520,2199497,5,vBas15,08/08/2022,"Amazing camping spot really modern, clean, and nice to spend time in. Note that the pricing listed on the app is not correct during the higher seasons: we payed 27.50 for a van with 2 people and no electricity, but electricity is 3 euro extra. Book ahead or come early!! We came at 20 one night and were refused, had to come back early next morning snd even then only 2 spots available."

The bathrooms are very clean and sparkling, the shower and toilet are nice. 2. the access to the beach is more like an access to the river, in which you cannot swim 3. it is close to Laredo on foot (25 min) 4. very pleasant atmosphere, you can dine on pizzas, sandwiches, and there is a mexican foodtruck, you can see the sunset!"

Right on the sea (dogs allowed too!), very friendly staff and a supermarket/restaurant right next to it with humane prices.

94520,1579041,4,santolargo,14/09/2021,I am right to choose this campsite after reading several reviews. Camper plus one adult on a very large plot with a sink in each plot has not reached 14 euros a day. Friendliness and good disposition of the girl at the reception with the possibility of changing plot if I saw another that I liked more. Updated and very clean toilets and showers.

Gray water disposal could be a bit scarce for large homes. A wonderful bar terrace with a view of the sea for a perfect Spain feeling rounds off the matter nicely. We will be back definitely!

Excessive price, a camper van, 2 people and electricity € 29.10. Taking into account that we only change waters and we do not use a bathroom, showers and the rest of the facilities.

All the amenities at your fingertips (air tires, drinking water, cassette emptying and wastewater). The environment is on the other hand a little ""average"" (background noise) even if the walk along the arm of the sea along which the campsite is located remains relatively calm. Attention for new arrivals using WAZE: do NOT follow the route proposed by the app which will go astray on improbable paths winding between agricultural enclosures and horse meadows, be sure to arrive on the campsite by the North on the asphalt and not by the East!"

94601,2793458,5,Arehucas,28/05/2023,We had a quiet night here. But ATTENTION! The entire area is marked with yellow lines. Means that you are not allowed to stand here. We drove to the site in pouring rain and thunderstorms and not a single resident was present.
94601,2551825,4,Bajonska,14/01/2023,"Free spot for up to 4 RVs directly on the beach, quiet during the off season. La Manga is a horrbile testament to seventies tourism architecture. All restaurants etc were closed. Not much to do around here."

94610,832496,4,izasisa,22/06/2020,"On Saturday night 06/20 the Ertzaintza appeared to check that everyone who was there was parked and not camped. It is a private space for public use and the owner of the tower called the police to denounce the ""camper"" attitude of some vehicle, removing tables and chairs, turning the parking lot into a camping site. If this is repeated it may be taken from us and the site is beautiful !!!"

I rate this place with a ""small"" 4. Place frequented by locals, about ten cars when we arrived (8 p.m.)"

94622,1469510,1,ringostarkey,17/08/2021,Authentic ecological disaster. Iberdrola emptied at night and treacherously the reservoir up to 11% of its capacity to generate electricity in its turbines at the time of the highest price of electricity in our country. Now a secarral for pure speculation. We had visited it last year and it was heaven. Hopefully he recovers to his previous state. It's a huge shame :-(
94622,1392028,5,arturohontalva,01/08/2021,Almost people in the evening. Alone for the night. Splendid view extremely calm. the water is low at this time. Difficult to access for large motorhomes

For us a recommended place, but if you want to be alone, no."
94622,910985,5,sukiinwonderlan,30/07/2020,"We came in the middle of summer, so during the day there are several people. To have a good parking space it is advisable to arrive at the end of the day. There is space for everyone to enjoy the place with a safe distance (corona time). It is a really beautiful place with wonderful water for swimming. We had a very quiet night with more vans. The access road is reasonable. Our van measures 7m"
94622,728263,4,Cathy1453,23/10/2019,Track is paved with concrete. You can park higher up than this on a flat piece of land just off the track. Very quiet spot.

94629,3184182,4,Mottaisc,19/08/2023,"We were able to sleep there one night, the location is made for a maximum of 3-4 vans. The only downside is that the locals come to fish there early and there are quite a few visitors in the morning. Do not hesitate to eat at Bar O Cais just above, they will make you discover Portuguese specialties for little money, we enjoyed ourselves!"
94629,3137554,4,claudiolietti,13/08/2023,Quiet and pleasant spot. Found other vans to sleep. Very close to the city. At night some fishermen arrive who don't bother and make the situation more authentic. Restaurant next door with very nice staff!

94629,3096006,4,Dezmog,07/08/2023,"Nice place to spend a night in a van, at the water's edge. The restaurant located next door is very good, with reasonable prices and quality service. People are lovely. On the other hand, a lot of passing cars and pedestrians, you should not be a light sleeper."
94629,3051498,3,WarwickAddison,31/07/2023,"The view was nice but not much privacy, lots of fishermen,cyclists and walkers but it was okay to spend a night. The Portuguese bar and restaurant up the road was amazing. a real local experience with great food, we ended up spending most of the evening at the restaurant."

Super nice walk along the river. Watch out at the side of the spot, broken stones, it’s unsafe! Also group of six stray dogs chased our cat so be careful with your pets. Maybe good to come late and leave early."
94629,2404890,1,Walter676,26/09/2022,"Driveway is currently being renewed and is currently borderline even for a van! And: Were chased away by the locals immediately after arrival, so better avoid this place!"

94629,1240103,5,Patrick0308,06/06/2021,"Great place, there are stairs for bathing. There is a well with drinking water at the restaurant 50 m away. It is 5 km to the old town. Great walk and bike path. If you want to ride a bike, just head towards the sea. Great bike path past the beaches with bars and restaurants for catering."
94629,1113647,3,AdrienFourmy,08/11/2020,"Nice place, indeed a few cars are parked but nothing disturbing. BE CAREFUL not to follow the GPS (with the address indicated) but to follow the GPS coordinates on Google Map, we found ourselves in a dead end, extremely steep with no room for maneuver !!! We were stuck for 2 hours because our engine overheated."
94629,1107855,4,RensJo,28/10/2020,Top spot! We took an Uber to the center from here.
94629,975499,5,LauAG,17/08/2020,"Quiet place, at the water's edge, you have to be independent because no water or toilet on site. Easy to access, after the restaurant you walk along the river and you arrive on a fairly flat place for the night."
94629,970259,1,topboy,16/08/2020,It’s actually a lovely place. Might be a good idea to avoid going on there during a weekend. You might end up in a full on rave with people drumming on your van and shaking it while you desperately trying to sleep over the music! If you in for a spontaneous techno party until 7am (with some really good music) that might be the place of choice.
94629,952704,5,Obornico,11/08/2020,We were at night. The views are superb. Quiet but they are working now and probably the site will be modify.
94629,794930,4,ABusAndBeyond,13/03/2020,Quiet spot by the water. A few locals in cars appeared to look at view but were quiet and left us to ourselves. Pretty view over the city. 7m van fit fine.
94629,760819,4,emilyld,31/12/2019,Not exactly ‘in nature’ but very good for a place so close to the city - fisherman around (perhaps not ideal for someone sleeping single) but they were all friendly and not talking too late.
94629,750907,4,MHF42,07/12/2019,Very typical and welcoming restaurant (23 € two courses + 2 drinks and bread). The night has been quiet. Many people came to park but left in the evening
94629,631039,4,2015,15/08/2019,"Typical restaurant, natural place"
94629,609719,2,Bastouf31,08/08/2019,"We stop there to picnic but not to sleep, it's pines, the water is not very clean down and I do not call it a spot in ""wilderness"""
94629,592321,4,rafix,02/08/2019,"Charming place, the restaurant did not miss the local with 0 tourist and a welcome o top to please us. The boss called us a cab to visit Porto. The truck is perfectly safe. The fishermen very welcoming."
94629,587672,4,AmAyVi,31/07/2019,Beautiful place with a beautiful view. The fishermen arrive early in the morning. End of evening animated with young people who come to pose with the music. With kiess balls we slept well.
94629,561147,1,florence976,18/07/2019,Very narrow place for a camper. Many maneuvers .... it's atypical indeed;) We leave
94629,555670,4,deno_familly,15/07/2019,Place a little atypical close to Porto. Accessible without problem with a motorhome of more than 7m. Not bad passage even at night (mainly fishermen). Very welcome at the little cafe cafe just next door.
94629,547697,4,danducati,10/07/2019,Very good place we recommend it and small welcoming restaurant spanking us to taste all the local specialties and speaking a little French and warm
94629,519047,5,boby21,17/06/2019,"Nice place, enough passage, fishermen and people from the neighborhoods, we had no feelings of insecurity. Good plan to go to the center of Porto thereafter."
94629,473052,2,AlindiraWaff,01/05/2019,"Small street narrow enough to access. We asked a young couple if the place was safe, they told us no, and that many young people gather here to smoke. We leave, just in case."
94629,332623,3,Bertricois,14/08/2018,Small dock friendly but a little dirty with some smells in the edge to be in the shade. Otherwise quiet but in the evening quite a few fishermen and car that come a little land. The view is still nice!
94655,2753474,5,Iamcharly,16/05/2023,"Amazing spot, not so difficult to get there (just be comfortable with small roads), quiet"
94655,1704175,5,NiklasGuggenberger,06/12/2021,"Just perfect and impressive, you should be there for sunset!"
94655,1664127,5,janindav,27/10/2021,Great way with access via the place Gorafe. Feasible with all-wheel drive T6.1. Some nice pitches along the way with breathtaking views.
94655,1182102,5,Patrick0308,30/04/2021,"Just great, I didn't get to the finish line. On the way there are great spots where you can park and stay overnight."
94655,1123473,5,lucasbiker,23/12/2020,"Easy to access , there is no one around and it's pretty calm"
94655,791470,5,threeinwood,05/03/2020,"Magnificent spot! And what a calm, never heard so little noise. 300 meters after what the GPS says. Again: beautiful"
94664,2921042,2,elgriegonet,04/07/2023,The water is out of service-it doesn't work
94664,1790285,3,Legrandnene,21/03/2022,large vehicles can access.
94664,1692282,3,estherkuntzelaers,18/11/2021,"You can park well to fill water. water for washing up, no drinking water!"
94664,364913,1,Arona,04/09/2018,It is a petrol station of Carrefour. It does not have places for the discharge of gray and black waters.
94690,1311597,1,naiaman,10/07/2021,"You need a token to use it, and you pay for it in the shop attached to the gas station. hygiene is not the best. 7.50 for 14kg."
94734,3088075,4,free82,06/08/2023,"It's okay to shower, you ask for the keys and they keep your ID or car keys. There are showers both at one station and the other, in both directions"
94734,2558100,5,justdoit81,22/01/2023,"GPL and diesel and fresh water full tank. With the latter, the trick is to take the station on the far right, only the hose is mounted there and it runs out very well. The shower was locked, but I didn't ask either, since I then showered in the camper. Diesel a bit expensive, otherwise great!"
94734,2455365,2,jessz123,21/10/2022,The showers are indeed free but the water is cold and the pressure is weak. Also no possibility of filling up water - all the water taps didn’t work.
94734,2093361,4,Ch31u,19/07/2022,"The very complete service station, access on foot, from some car parks next door, it is impossible to enter with the vehicle if you do not come down from Lisbon. Free showers, with good pressure. We tried to sleep in the parking area outside the service area, but the noise from the airport, along with the noise from the highway, the mosquitoes, was important Dumpsters in the environment, keep the area clean."
94734,1799289,5,akenatom,28/03/2022,Large service area where you can eat and take a free shower. It's perfect.
94734,1781426,5,Mikael63,12/03/2022,Amazing! A clean and free hot water shower!
94734,378273,4,ENCB153,20/09/2018,"Safe, but a little noisy. We could shower for free at the gas station. The bathrooms in the Burger King were clean and open all night."
94752,2818411,5,GuidoDB,04/06/2023,Super quite place. Surrounded by nature
94752,2649927,5,angeljo,08/04/2023,"In the middle of nature, on the banks of the Navalcan reservoir. We have been at Easter and there were many people in the afternoon for a picnic. When night falls you are left alone, together with the fishermen. Beautiful sunsets and sunrises. It is accessed by dirt road in relatively good condition. There are lots of idyllic spots along the banks of the entire swamp and under the holm oaks. With rain it will be difficult."
94752,736274,5,Compilador,02/11/2019,"Views of the Navalcan swamp, very quiet area for bird lovers. Easy access for cars"
94752,507986,5,Hanou,08/06/2019,Very nice place thank you for the place we are early June it is good and there are some local picnic near this beautiful lake attention preserve this beautiful place
94772,3255095,3,Tiph.Tzl,03/09/2023,Stayed on August 25 in a roof tent. Waste collection upon arrival because other previous users did not respect the premises. Quiet by the river without too many mosquitoes. Motorhomes and vans arrived after midnight without paying attention to others and noises. It's a shame.
