15873,2652817,4,Martybhoy,09/04/2023,"8/4/23 Perfect stop over, quiet at night, flat and lovely view. 3 motorhomes the night we were there. There are no services. It’s a popular place for launching private boats and also boat tours."
15873,2633535,4,Peterwest,01/04/2023,we stood here for two quiet nights and made an organized tour of the lake and along the dam from here.
15873,2573456,4,walsch,10/02/2023,"the place is good for one night because it is quiet.... there are actually no dogs barking at times. However, apart from the dam wall and the lake, there is nothing. The construction site is still there, but doesn't bother us at all at night. Cell phone is very good."
15873,2495854,1,OzeanienArt-on-Tour,15/11/2022,"The pictures are totally out of date. There is a large construction site here, where work is loud from 7.30 a.m. until at least 7 p.m. in the evening. And it's not pretty! If you only come for the night, you may be lucky!"
15873,2448662,5,floracbl,17/10/2022,Spot with a very beautiful view of the lake and an incredible starry sky. A few passages of cars in the parking lot until late at night but not very disturbing. Always some problems of cleanliness people have trouble paying attention to their trash...
15873,2382266,3,mtalhao,18/09/2022,Excellent location with a fantastic view of the dam. Wonderful sunset. Quite quiet but without any night lighting. No services but nearby Alqueva.

15873,1940661,4,jacksgreen,02/06/2022,"A lovely place to park, did two nights in the week. Only thing I could say is they need to empty the rubbish bins. As we all clean up after us but if the bins are full it just blows across the the park."
15873,1903173,4,yoyo65400,20/05/2022,"We arrived at 6 PM two French camper van were already there the place is flat and big enough for 10 vans, the sunset was pretty nice. Easy access to the water if you have your own standup paddle-board but not really enjoyable for swimming because of seaweed on the lake shore."

15873,1753899,4,DianaSchneider,12/02/2022,"Very nice place and quiet location, despite the proximity of the dam. Very clean hope they keep it clean. Since there is a free supply and disposal facility 6km away, including for chemical toilets."
15873,1681417,5,acmarino,07/11/2021,"Pleasant place but no dumps or water for motorhomes. Today and Sunday and the snack bar was open and the boat trips were working with a large group of people renting for tours. There were more than 100 people in the place besides 02 ACs. There is no sign to prohibit motorhomes, but we didn't spend the night because we couldn't dump gray and black water."
15873,1634526,5,idavolta,09/10/2021,"Very nice spot quiet bit busy on the WE, beautifull sunset and sunrise.

15873,1126254,5,shauwert,31/12/2020,Nice spot on the water. At 1:00 am we came across 2 cars with loud music but they left after 15 minutes. Beautiful view of the dam and the water.
15873,1122700,5,zboink,20/12/2020,"Perfect place to spend the night by the dam. GNR came over and said it was OK for campers to spend the night. Please behave, don't leave any rubbish behind so this doesn't change and everyone can enjoy the area."
15873,1122564,4,SadieDaisymoo,20/12/2020,"Big open carpark, very quiet at night. Fishermen launch their boats from the slip road and a few other day visitors. We stayed 2 nights and were not bothered. The cats don't look thin but are more than happy to have any scraps you throw them."
15873,1116919,5,Yupiteam,22/11/2020,A very nice and calm place.
15873,1114843,4,newhome_newadventure,13/11/2020,"Nice and quiet in the night, in day time people come and visit the lake. 
Beware there are cats, and they will sleep under your hood/by your engine. Just open the hood in the morning before you leave to check if any cats are there. They dont move if you start the engine. I had 4 cats laying under my hood, they jumped away as soon as I opened it."

No problem parking, we asked the police and they said it was OK to sleep. Worth visiting the Praia Fluvial da Amieira, which has outside showers  and it is close by (12kms) but apparently no overnight parking permitted."
15873,904142,5,nevesss,27/07/2020,Awesome place. A boat tour company and the lake very close to take a swim. Spent a night here and the sunset along with the stars made our stay just perfect.
15873,868555,5,Paupinkpomme,14/07/2020,We came at night fleeing from COVID19 and the heat of Extremadura and we found this piece of epic swamp ... without words very easy and soft ... alone at night .. the stars accompanied us on a magical evening .. bath in God level morning ... Highly recommended! The people who work at the beach bar very very friendly!

No services, bar nearby."
15873,788854,3,ElVeterano,29/02/2020,Nice spot. No tree work going on when we were there. Good for one night. At least 10 other campers there but plenty of room at this time of year
15873,782888,3,GoereLG,19/02/2020,"I can confirm the last comment: there is still tree removal and wood shreddening going on and therefore pretty much noise at daytime. 
No access to toilets. 
Rubbish bins on the spot.
Nice view across the lake especially at sundown, sheep in the nearby surrounding and lovely paths to walk, too. From time to time there are some fishermen or boat cruises."
15873,778416,4,Ayesha,09/02/2020,Superb sunset. Plenty of space to park but there was some tree removal happening so not the quietest during the daytime at the mo. The adjacent watersports company are excellent -Alentejo Break.

15921,3286501,4,Guri,11/09/2023,"We slept the night of September 2 in the parking lot next to the area since it was full. Uneven parking so parking spaces are required, quiet and spectacular views"
15921,3276852,3,neonebirus,09/09/2023,"Parking area with many spaces, free and close to the beach, it has services for motorhomes and public showers, also a few meters away, with daytime hours there are toilets and changing rooms. The problem for my taste is that it is overcrowded, too many people and vehicles."
15921,3273359,5,mariinaa11,08/09/2023,Quiet and easily accessible motorhome area. It is close to a very beautiful estuary and has showers and bathrooms a few meters away (check schedule). The beach is 5 minutes walk away.
15921,3218580,5,SonnItaly,26/08/2023,"Excellent rest area with services, 3 outdoor showers for the beach, close to a wonderful beach equipped with a bar. With 1.80 cents from the port you can take the ferry that passes once an hour (until 11pm) to reach the center of Viana do Castelo. Safe and comfortable area."
15921,3218249,5,riafrederickx,25/08/2023,Perfect Camper Place. Close to beautiful beaches with restaurant and beach bar. And with the transfer for € 1.8 to the center. We arrived when it was very busy. The campers were very close together. The next day there was more room. 2 service points! Recommended : go to the dome of the Iglesia de Santa Lizia for 2 €
15921,3191263,5,elliottjones,21/08/2023,"Stayed here, there are 3 free showers, clean drinking water points and a ferry that leaves on the hour every hour from 10am till midnight, it’s €1.80 and it gets you across into town, the beach is an ace sheltered windsurfing / wingfoiling or kite surfing launching spot, poses well if you don’t want to launch on a shore dump, would 100% recommend if you’re in a camper the people we had near were super friendly and helpful. There are bins provided please use them and keep this gem alive."
15921,3174484,5,vtapiasa,18/08/2023,"We have spent two nights and it has been perfect, you have the beach nearby and all the free services, water, drainage and showers as well as a restaurant nearby and spectacular views, there are usually people and car traffic but nothing major"
15921,3162626,3,daianabouzo,16/08/2023,It was very crowded and there was not enough space. Very good showers!
15921,3121631,3,bodysalta,11/08/2023,"Good place but there was a disco or something on the other side of the estuary and it was impossible to sleep, I went several km away and it was still heard, incredible. Otherwise the area is fine, the beach is very pretty and there are surf schools and good waves. The beach is full of cars before 11 am"
15921,3119017,2,koyake,11/08/2023,"Very busy place, but outside parking is available. unbearable a large open-air disco that makes music continuously from early afternoon. It is now 3.45am and it hasn't stopped since 4pm yesterday. The services work well."
15921,3118737,4,rocio82,10/08/2023,Complete and few places. We have parked in the car park in a place where you can invade part of the grass so that you do not get fined. It is full of cars and very close together. The beach is very beautiful and the natural walk to the beautiful beach. To spend 1 day at the beach and we have slept 1 night. There really are ACs that have been in the area for many days
15921,3105911,5,traven.pl,09/08/2023,we made a service here only
15921,3087558,4,FamilyBun,06/08/2023,"We spent 3 nights there, the place is rather quiet, the places are popular. The view may not be great, but the proximity to the beach and its superb view make us forget that. Points+ drinking water, bins, shower, toilets not far at beach level and the boat to cross points - waste many don't bother to throw it in the trash and no shops"
15921,3087054,2,LinceNomada,06/08/2023,"I was in August and a bad place. The area is not delimited and if it is, people go through everything. They occupy even the loading and emptying areas of A/C. I had to put my G/V van in front of the taps that I could easily catch and I left the place like a soul that takes the devil"
15921,3067411,4,lecar,03/08/2023,"Great place made 2 nights. Busy Did not use the shower, as we just shower in the camper. Pont nearby for € 1.80 pp one way to the other side, we went to Santa Luzia, nice view. Restaurant fine.."
15921,3030150,3,viajamoslibre,27/07/2023,"Ok to spend a night and visit the town. The nearby beaches are also very nice. But at night there is a lot of noise, movement, motorbikes and cars coming and going. It's not great."
15921,3016966,4,Paichi,25/07/2023,"In the AC it is practically impossible to park, but downstairs, where the loading/unloading area, there are plenty of spaces at the last minute. You sleep relatively well but late, because people are talking and walking around until 1 in the morning calmly, and then at 9 AM everyone is already active. The views are cool"
15921,2970721,1,nidia1888,16/07/2023,"Magnificent facilities if it weren't because it seems that you are sleeping in the parking lot of a nightclub. Loud music from the beach bars, music from the restaurants. Drunken noises. I keep passing cars."
15921,2966508,4,Flotineta,15/07/2023,"We've been here for one night and will stay for two. very busy 24 hours a day by fishermen, even at 5 in the morning. For the rest fine, quiet area on the banks of the river. the upper area of motorhomes much better but full. services for emptying, showers, beach, restaurant... quite well set up."
15921,2956775,3,Fryzo,13/07/2023,"Good area, although noisy, vehicles pass at night and in the early hours. Very fair and almost always occupied places. 2 free emptying and filling areas."
15921,2952824,3,esteladlh,12/07/2023,"very nice and quite flat, free filling and emptying of gray and black water right next to it and free outdoor showers, the only thing that many cars pass by and from 6 in the morning a lot of noise from cars and garbage trucks without stopping, for the rest very good"
15921,2927629,4,Abril22,05/07/2023,"Quiet night, although the motorhome site was full. There is no problem to spend the night in the surroundings. Beach for surfing although recommended to go with children to play. Accessible."
15921,2918043,1,miticoarpege,03/07/2023,"I don't understand so much enthusiasm for an area where the campers are all cramped, with constant passage of cars and a view of the industrial area"
15921,2916311,4,RufioF1,02/07/2023,We pass only for water filling and emptying. All ok. All seats occupied.
15921,2901707,5,AnnelieBe,28/06/2023,"Beautiful beach and nice area, we were pleasantly surprised. The Aquario restaurant comes highly recommended. The 2 nights were very quiet. We felt safe and comfortable."
15921,2896280,5,Lorenayedu,26/06/2023,"Quiet place next to the sea, we slept very peacefully and it has everything, to fill, empty... all free. The only drawback is that the town falls about 4km from there, it has an access that you go down to the estuary and they take you by ""ferry"" to the town for about 2e"
15921,2892964,4,FernandoHymer,26/06/2023,"Nice area with two places to do technical changes of waters and wc.
Parking leveled near the river Lima and the beach.
On summer you have boat to the other border at the city of Viana do Castelo.
Beside the parking area you can see the ruins of a lime kiln from the XIX century. Dont leave in it your garbage as some people do.
Recomended."
15921,2883953,4,Felipent,23/06/2023,"Great spot, thanks to the municipality. With free services. beautiful look. I recommend."
15921,2871857,3,LaTourneta,19/06/2023,"The place is magnificent, but the state in which the sewage emptying points are located is lamentable"
15921,2851983,5,claraisaco,13/06/2023,"Very quiet area, apart from the parking behind the bar there is another area where we find more vans and caravans."
15921,2831444,5,WillSexton,08/06/2023,"5* for Great beach access and showers. Not loads of spaces but there is the the lot next to the old restaurant which seems to act as overflow. Nice water and waste services. View of the  harbour, access to town by ferry or bike. A few cars at night but nothing bad."
15921,2828842,5,BarriereCeline,07/06/2023,"A great location with beach right next door, super clean toilets and shower. Bike path to go into the city."
15921,2822397,4,terraverde4x4,05/06/2023,"It has approximately 7 official seats. On the side there is also space for parking and above, behind the evictions, there is also a parking lot on land that can be parked, albeit unofficially. It has two places for dumps, although it is difficult to make a U-turn afterwards with long caravans, if they have cars parked in the park in front. We stayed in the upper land park."
15921,2815583,3,eagleroad,03/06/2023,"Accessible drain that works, as the other comments say, good site...yes the day! Because for the night, car, motorbike, passing by making their engines howl, music, it's not for me But thank you to the municipality for this camping car site."
15921,2813070,4,ChrisGew,02/06/2023,Quiet place in a good location. Toilets and showers available during the day.
15921,2782397,4,Xansa,24/05/2023,"It is a good place to spend the night, but there are very few places. A little further on, there is a parking lot where there were several caravans and, apparently, without a problem. At the top, in a dirt parking lot, several vans were parked. Quiet night, and breakfast next to the exit of the commercial port."
15921,2777497,4,ReinerReisdorf,23/05/2023,"Officially 7 parking spaces for campers. Supply and disposal possible. Unfortunately, very short park bays have stood over with our 8 m Womo. Ferry runs around the corner from 10 a.m. opposite to the city (€1.80 per person per trip)."
15921,2771673,4,bertiebuggie,21/05/2023,Very popular site. Get here early! The parking places are quite tight and not very long. We are 6m and fitted ok but not much spare. There are two service points both with fresh water taps away from the cassette emptying points. Ferry is ok and handy for visiting the town which is really interesting.
15921,2742987,4,Richar45,12/05/2023,"Several parking spaces, including at the top behind the small restaurant. Exceptional view of Viana do Castelo. Below, along the river, 2 large places reserved for emptying and water supply. Bins available."
15921,2711248,5,dragonqueen,30/04/2023,"Nice place, disposal option with fresh water top. Good possibilities for showering and public toilets. Was full at the weekend"
15921,2674375,5,Ba8709,16/04/2023,"It is a good place to camp, although I suppose that in summer it will be very crowded, it has everything in terms of service"
15921,2664397,4,Bignugget,12/04/2023,"A good place to stay, at least this time of year. Beautiful beach, small bars, surf lessons, very neat showers open during the day, good and clean service station. Viana do Castelo is worth a visit."
15921,2649939,5,Marcoblau,08/04/2023,It looks like a new site. perfect for downloading and loading water. It's at the end of the road. eye for maneuvers
15921,2648378,3,Hoodma,07/04/2023,"Quite a large area, service systems that deserve attention so as not to clean the pot in the clean water (I saw it in person and I don't understand how it is possible to do that). Very far from the town next to beaches and surf schools"
15921,2646058,4,animurillo99,07/04/2023,"It is next to a car park, everything is quite full but even so we have spent a very quiet night. I recommend it!"
15921,2644345,3,pablo.dominguez,06/04/2023,"We spent one night there, pretty quiet. There are 2 areas for loading and unloading water, but one of them is already clogged and did not work. In any case, the state of both leaves a lot to be desired, they don't deserve more than 3 stars. There is enough room, but there is a lot of occupation, both AC and passenger cars. The beach is 300 meters away, very good for water sports (kite, surf, windsurf"

There is no uber in the city to visit the center, so you will have to walk or cycle. 150m from the area, there is the restaurant “foz” which is wonderful. We managed to fill the water tank and empty it too. Only problem: being a coastal area, too windy! We left before dawn, as the motorhome was rocking a lot!"

15921,2094887,3,arlenebaart,19/07/2022,"We stayed here for one night, the parking spaces are quite small (our bus is 7 meters) and it is a rather uninviting corner. The service point is not really clean, but works fine. A plus are the showers. We have spent more than a week at a place just down the road. The parking lot is right next to the ferry that takes you to the other side in 5 minutes. In our opinion, the perfect place to seek out the crowds if you want, but above all to cool down and enjoy water sports at the beach."

We parked on the top at the car park without any issues (we have a converted van but there was also several RVs there). The only downside is the noise because of the restaurant there was always cars coming and going and people talking loudly until about 2 am."
15921,1009731,3,martincr,28/08/2020,"Far from the center, it is the only downside. Despite that, it has everything you need."
15921,982234,5,adri1601,19/08/2020,"We spent one night in the asphalt parking lot and great! Very quiet area, you have to empty clean and dirty water and to take drinking water. There are showers at the back but they are open so we personally didn't like them and we didn't shower."

To go to town you have to go by boat (it passes every hour) € 1.50 and you can take it there."
15921,951970,3,Titopomi,11/08/2020,"The area is next to a beach and a couple of bars. There are toilets and showers. Far from the center. If you are walking or cycling, you have to cross to the other side of the river through a bridge with a lot of traffic and a very narrow sidewalk."
15921,946561,5,victoria1yem,10/08/2020,"Good free spot to stay overnight. You have access to the beach, the toilets are open from 9:30 to 19:30. Showers at the entrance to the beach are not working atm because of covid, but there are two more showers at the parking spot. You can fill up your water tank for free. At this spot there are mostly only motorhomes, but there is one small spot a bit above, where are mostly vans - we chose the one with vans and met some nice people there. There is one big pothole in the middle, so just be careful."
15921,942041,4,Pedrogu,09/08/2020,"Very good place, it has everything and the showers are not very cold. We were in the parking lot above and had a problem, that around 2 o'clock a group of people came and started to make bottles and they didn't let us sleep, it was probably Saturday during the week this very well."
15921,940983,4,JuliaAlgeciras82,08/08/2020,"Area right in front of the town of Viana with very few places. There are outdoor showers and free gray water filling and draining area. The views at night are very good. Despite the few spaces around it, it is full of parking spaces occupied by vans that overnight without problem.

15921,933424,3,appellover,05/08/2020,"The service areas (2) are fine and free water. The problem is to turn around because it is a dead end and there are many cars.

15921,920787,4,cesla20,02/08/2020,"Site near Viana do Castelo, flat land and gray water can be emptied, it is not the best service area but it does its job. It would be nice if they installed a tap where they could hook the hose to clean the Potti well, but since it is free, better not to complain ..."

15921,786478,2,Jannes_P,25/02/2020,"The service stations are good. However, it's quite a popular spot, not only with campers but also with local fishermen who stay next to the place overnight, silently walking around and sometimes having a chat with each other long after midnight. At least that's what they do in February - I'm not informed about the annual change in the habits of fish and fishermen."

15921,649395,4,Lavalmar,21/08/2019,The area is small and more at parties like ns has coincided with us. It has all the services how bad it is quite crowded because they also park cars everywhere. The location is perfect next to the beach and with the boat stop (€ 1.50) that crosses you to the other side to visit the Center. We liked it and we stayed for a couple of days because the truth was that we were lucky to put up
15921,643844,4,dragoneta,19/08/2019,"It is added that there is a specific service for nautical toilet. something as simple as a sewer on the floor with a lid, I don't know how all the new areas don't include it. if the area is a bit neglected. double service of all water, black gray but one of the two blunted."
15921,642563,3,Alromo,19/08/2019,"Ac area of few places, where cars park. There is an esplanade of land above with fair access for large motorhomes. Place to recharge and empty waters. In summer they open showers and toilets to serve people on the beach. The beach of Cabedelo is nearby. The town can be reached by boat from the motorhome area for € 1.5 the way. It is the fair many firecrackers at all hours."
15921,632098,4,virginiaher,15/08/2019,The site highly recommended and the visit to the town and the Monastery of Santa Lucia too. the only bad thing was that we agreed with a techno music festival that lasted 4 days less badly that we arrived last (August 7-10) but it was unbearable we could not sleep and even for the day at the beach the noise was very unpleasant. Recommended and economical the surf school of Playa Grande that is nearby and the little boat what happens to the town very practical until 12 at night
15921,615554,5,virginiaher,10/08/2019,"Few places but ideal, two beaches next door, a small and quiet, another large and wilder with surf school. A little inclined."

The old town is excellent to wander round. We ate evening meals at the O Birren (Great service and excellent food, if you are on Spanish time tables are much harder to come by). There are Excellent Thermas about 3 miles away, in Prexigueiro, cycled there twice."

More than 30 wine cellars to visit."

16014,2927728,4,BreakingVan,05/07/2023,"I give it 4 stars for location, shade, and the O birran bar that is nearby. To fill and empty on a slope, we did not use it, because we did not need it and it seemed complicated. The noisy night, the ground forces us all to stand on one side, and too close, and it coincided that there were many rental motorhomes with children. And at 8 someone mowing the field woke us up."
16014,2853060,4,HooLee,14/06/2023,"Level squares, calm night, pretty route nearby. It's a pity you can't take a bath."

Here the Ribeiro wine fair is held, with a large influx of people, the area and the surroundings are filled with motorhomes."
16014,2693578,4,rondepon,24/04/2023,"motorhome under the trees. lovely when it would be hot. for Solar less. places are slanted, so blocks are needed. Loose and loading place is slightly higher. the old town part is beautiful to see."

16014,2639802,4,pablo.dominguez,04/04/2023,"Ample parking area, quiet and away from the noise. We spent a quiet night after visiting the historic center and the Jewish quarter. The only thing that is the soil is sandy, it could be somewhat better conditioned, since on days with bad weather it must be a quagmire."
16014,2590742,3,MiriVan8,25/02/2023,"The truth is that I expected something better when I saw such a good score... The town is pretty and the location of the area is good but the area itself is uneven (it is difficult to find a level place), the cars park inside the reserved area and at the Being a land area there is mud. The loading and unloading area seemed quite improvable to me. Even with all this, it is appreciated to have an area for ourselves."
16014,2572346,4,javeasteve5,09/02/2023,"Spent winters night here with two others, looks grubby due to fallen branches and leaves.  Did not use services. Quiet night, only sound was owls.  Townspeople appeared friendly and happy to see tourist.  Parked on compact earth with some gravel, relatively flat, some dog walkers."

The only drawback in our visit is that the water service was made from a drum with an outlet that was impossible to load (if to supply from some utensil) we assume that it was due to the drought or something like that."

16014,2318797,5,javimad-87,29/08/2022,perfect and shady place close to the playground and city center. the only drawback is that neither of the two taps on the water supply work. I hope they fix it soon and it will get the five stars they deserve

With shade between trees, water loading, gray and black unloading, very close to the pretty town (you get lost in its downtown streets), close to restaurants where you can't leave without trying the octopus! The only drawback is the unevenness of some squares"

Area in which they denounce the cars that park inside, bravo for the City Council. With a lot of shade, the water taps did not work, as an alternative there are some 1000 liter drums with a very very large tap"

16014,2217655,1,navenodriza,11/08/2022,"Bad atmosphere: around there was a group of pimps disturbing. If you have arrived after 3:00 p.m., stay in the motorhome because the bars close the door in your face at that time, most do not attend and they throw you out in a bad way. I will not come back"
16014,2209070,4,bekampervan,10/08/2022,"Good place to sleep, you sleep very quietly, next to the old town and the civil guard barracks, the only thing that there is no water to make the change, it was cut off. We have slept next to more vans."

The location is ideal since it is a very quiet area, and after a 2-minute walk you are in the center of the town, which is beautiful and worth taking a walk to visit."
16014,2190218,5,AC360,07/08/2022,"Site very close to the historic center, quiet with filling and emptying of water. Shade. We recommend the Papuxa tavern (from the 12th century), they don't offer a wide variety of things but everything is tasty. The site is worth visiting, very cheap."
16014,2186231,4,omotecoolninja,06/08/2022,"Very nice location for the shaded bivouac under the plane trees. The old town located 10 minutes on foot is magnificent to visit and take advantage of the stay to taste the specialty ""Pulpo a baira"". Swimming in the Rio Avia is excellent. The only negative point, no water for cleaning and emptying this morning at 9:00 am. Enjoy your stay in Galicia."
16014,2183572,5,belarmino,06/08/2022,Wooded area and very quiet at night. There is room for emptying water. Charming little town just 10 minutes from the thermal pools. It is not necessary to go to the paid ones because following the path there are free ones all over the river
16014,2180879,5,V.Lopez,05/08/2022,"Large shaded parking 4 min walk from the historic center, beautiful. Gray, black and water download. If, instead of entering through the walled arch, you continue straight on, you will see some stairs that, if you go down, lead to a path that borders the river, with access descents.

16014,2133361,4,Fran21,27/07/2022,"Ideal place to stay one night and visit the town with great charm. To catch the water you need a hose of more than five meters.

16014,685278,4,padraigl,10/09/2019,"This Aire is under trees. The ground is sandy/dirt and very dusty with pitch markings of large wooden planks, the trees themselves and are not level. It's not great for satellite reception or solar panels but you can't have everything. 
There are caravans in the top and far corner of the carpark that look permanent but maybe belong to the carnival in the town. Locals also park their cars here.

We happened to stay the 9th September which is a holiday here. There was a street procession of the Virgin Mary and later in the evening a free orchestral concert in the outdoor Castle Auditorium which was brilliant. The town was in party mode and a band played until 1am.
The next day Tuesday was market day and we had to wait until 3pm to be able to get out of the town.

There are full services excluding electricity in a separate small narrow carpark with its own entrance before the Aire entrance..

The grey waste is a normal ground drain.
The black WC drain is 500mm off the ground and is under a large cover which is all stainless steel and good and deep reducing splash back. There is a push button tap just above the drain to clean the cassette. The button is very stiff and when you do press it the water is strong and goes everywhere. I can see people using the easier to manage fresh water tap.
The separate fresh water tap is a normal screw-on connection with a press button and excellent pressure.
There was a large bin on the road below the Aire.

The town is 2 minutes up the road with plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from. The nicest bread is from a coffee shop close to the castle.

Bugs/Mosquitoes. (They love us..)
We did not encounter any mosquitoes eventhough we were at the outdoor concert until 22.30."

The trees give a lot of shade when sun is shining but, they also take away any view on a satellite. So if you want to watch TV, this spot may be not the right one for you. Only in the far right one may find free view on the sky so your TV will work. But that area is just good for max 2 campervans. The town as such did not really catch me, it was a Monday and all shops were closed. Nevertheless a nice area for one or two nights."

Swimming pool ideal for kids. we paid 26.6 € for a camper of 7.5 m and 4 adults, without electricity. Friendly welcome in perfect French. noise from the nearby main road is not disturbing at all. Hardly any traffic at night."
16044,3048718,5,teufteuf68,30/07/2023,"Nothing more to say than the previous comments. Old-fashioned campsite, friendly welcome, “free” pitches in the square, aging sanitary facilities but which have the merit of being present in several places and therefore not too far from all the pitches. Everything is clean. 6€ for the van and 5€ per adult to stay until 5:00 p.m. the next day."
16044,3029817,5,meestik,27/07/2023,"30-year-old campsite but still having an effect! We also stayed there for 2 days to take advantage of the swimming pool, the cycle paths, the barbecues with patios and to rest. The person who welcomed us, who speaks impeccable French, is very caring for everyone."
16044,2983701,5,Elisabeth49,18/07/2023,"We stayed here for one night and really enjoyed the place. Admittedly, the campsite is rustic, but I have rarely seen such clean sanitary facilities on a campsite. We paid €5 per adult and €6 for a van under 6 m. Departure 5 p.m. max, we were able to enjoy the swimming pool. No problem to have a location without reservation and at the last minute. Very welcoming staff."
16044,2916750,5,Inexitah,02/07/2023,"Very pleasant park, with a lake, farm with some animals, swimming pool, children's playground, soccer field, minigolf, etc. Several toilets, modest but very clean. Cafe/restaurant Gray water dump area could be wider."
16044,2846220,4,boltpark4nite,12/06/2023,"Like a ""Robinson place"", 14 euros/night - pool, showers, barbecue areas and lots of ducks and animals. super nicely laid out and great environment with bike paths to the nearby lake 5min nature reserve. 15 minutes to the beach. and it expects a powdered sugar beach by the sea with a great beach bar, as you know it from punta cana. yes, the camping is getting old but has its charm!"
16044,2805910,5,JosCiel,31/05/2023,"We thought it was a wonderful and quiet campsite. Spacious pitches. Many toilet blocks; not new but everything works. Hot water with good water pressure. Lots of trash cans and water points. Very affordable. Friendly welcome, the lady spoke very good English. Exactly our kind of camping. Stayed 5 nights instead of 2 planned nights..."
16044,2761796,5,Feuerrotespielmobil,18/05/2023,"The campsite is located on numerous well-developed cycling and hiking trails. It's well laid out, lots of space, plenty of sanitary blocks and grills, and the most spacious showers we've ever had with hot water. Formerly a showpiece course but still clean and full of charm today! We felt very safe and comfortable! You can even cycle the 30 km to Aveiro!"
16044,2730316,5,patou19,07/05/2023,Giving comments on the campsite would be better or a small Portuguese paradise a welcome with a soft voice and the correct price with sanitary facilities and a beautiful pond what more in this beautiful country
16044,2706833,1,fister,29/04/2023,"This entire area is unsafe. The hunters put illegal poison out to kill the wild dogs, and they threaten to kill you if you see it. We saw photos of many dead dogs from this area. The police knows who it is"

16044,2297247,3,DobloThibs,24/08/2022,"the place is amazing, it feels like an abandoned city, visiting a Chernobyl campsite. frankly we can not put 5 stars because it is much too old. on the other hand, it's worth spending a night there just for the change of scenery. we imagine this campsite 15 years ago in its heyday, everything abandoned! it's so crazy."
16044,2263805,3,breizhnous,18/08/2022,"large plots on well-shaded grounds. The reception is very nice with several activities to do. on the other hand, the toilets and the washing-up area are not maintained, the campsite is quite old. We feel a place that must have been top in its heyday."

16044,2232503,2,Cocomingo,13/08/2022,No electricity according to a sign at the entrance to the campsite. The reception tells us that it's full and that we won't find more places in the campsites in the area. Home not very pleasant.

It has a swimming pool, supermarket, bar, tennis court. 30 minutes from Aveiro. We have spent three nights and we have been very comfortable, it is so big that despite being August we are super far from the others so it gives a lot of privacy. It has good wifi in a room with sofas and a table."
16044,2175661,4,SyFri,04/08/2022,"Very nice CP, spacious with large pitches. However, the showers probably run on solar heating. The current prices in the season per night: €4.80 per person, €6.00 for campers under 6m and €2.00 for a dog."
16044,2082747,5,CarinaDolezich,16/07/2022,"Very nice campsite, unfortunately very deserted - it looks like something was really going on 30 years ago. With a beautiful pool, mini golf, etc. - all colorful & a bar right next door. Very quiet and pleasant, large pitches with shade - many outdated but clean sanitary facilities & wash basins directly at each pitch. One person, car, tent & dog €11.90. Lovely again!"

16044,946640,4,iratilekirai,10/08/2020,"We found it to be a charming campsite: with its stream, its ducks, bridges or long logs to pass the river from one side to the other ... It was not our case, but we thought that to go with children is a cane! We would return."
16044,884764,1,chiropra,20/07/2020,"Portuguese campsite from the 1950s where nothing is suitable for motorhomes. the accesses are very narrow, rutted and as that was not enough they added donkeys. the pitches are very small. for emptying, the location is for the liliputians. the worst is that this campsite is surrounded by the ring road of the superb city of mira and wake-up guaranteed at 6am!"
16044,793495,4,RolloFC,09/03/2020,"We are currently the only campers on this site. That is why he seems a little lonely and abandoned. The local permanent campers are apparently only on weekends on site. Like all courses in this region, it shines with 70s flair and could use some color. The sanitary facilities are old, but clean! You can tell that we are traveling in the pre-season. The place is just awakened from hibernation and prepared. There is a lot to discover for children! Conclusion: Alone creepy, if there were several campers here, really fine! Swimming pool: closed pre-season Sports facility: closed pre-season Restaurant: not tested"

For the price, you have access to the pool that we have not tested. In short, perfect for a short stay. The reception is very courteous and is done in several languages including French."

16044,157583,4,Jeranne,24/07/2017,"Very clean and welcoming campsite (maybe a little dated but maintained!). Bad luck, we had a bad week, there was a lot of wind. Not many people at the end of July !!!"
16044,94830,2,nierknierk,15/08/2016,"Camping that could be nice, but archie armored. The pool is not even accessible. Not possible to have electricity because quota exceeded and a lot of noise, too close to the national road. In short if you seek calm this campsite is not for you. Off season it must be fine."

16044,88674,4,yvesisere,03/08/2016,"So, if, of the place, including for large motorhomes. Under the pines, near a flotilla of ducks. Camping a little outdated, it's true, but it also makes its charm. And few people in early August. And the bike beach to take you to the beach. We were able to practice naturism a few km north of the Praia de Mira, in Barra de Mira, walking about ten minutes on the beach."

Fishing fans, do not forget your canes! No bus to get to town. There is an Intermarché with laundromat and everything needed to drain and replenish water. He is very good and some employees are bilingual. But it is a little difficult to find: on the national road that goes to Cantanhede / Figueira da Foz."

16049,3102090,4,Spildy,08/08/2023,"We spent a really good night, we didn’t park exactly at this parking, but at the road to it, so we had more privacy and space. A lot of flies and little bit of smell from the sea. Be careful, in the morning came police patrol and (maybe) charged people who had a table and chairs in front their car. But in the evening no problems."
16049,3081530,5,MiguelMY,05/08/2023,"Very good place to spend the night, only noise from the women waves. A step away from the center, which can be reached by taking a walk to the lake on the coast. Arrive early or late, as the parking lot is full of vehicles."

Be very careful because the access that the GPS gives you from the town will take you to a street with no exit, the best way to access it is by the road that goes to Baiona, take the detour that says playa area grande. Spectacular sunset."

The only downside, the behavior of 4 AC that went together; tables and chairs in the street, commotion, laughter, etc. It was after 12 at night and they were still with their attitude, so we decided to leave. A shame."

The only drawback: in the morning, the completely empty square fills up very quickly with anglers and especially spear fishermen who get ready on the square. So if you want to sleep in comfortably in the morning and have breakfast, you should go somewhere else."

There is a great small asphalt square by the rocky beach as a perfect spot for morning yoga. Please keep it clean and take your papers and take your trash.
16055,1955230,5,zofe,07/06/2022,"The path down from the upper car park was recently renewed. The lower park is still bumpy and uneven.

16059,2707751,1,LordMaster,29/04/2023,"Small pitches for motorhomes. Difficult to maneuver. Very noisy and not at all familiar: the campsite owners are not capable of telling those who are bothering them to turn off the music, although according to them they reserve the right to kick out disturbing customers."
16059,2670861,4,martenchristine,14/04/2023,"Campsite, clean. Very good and clean toilets. 15 at night without electricity."
16059,2610859,3,rodrigmi,15/03/2023,"Clean, tidy campsite, good shade. Super clean showers and toilets. Very good price with the ACSI card Attentive and friendly service staff, but telephone management leaves much to be desired, this aspect must be improved a lot. A negative aspect is the poor bus service to go to Torrox-pueblo and Torrox-costa"
16059,2609253,4,henkenelise,14/03/2023,Much has been written about this neat clean campsite. You need a bicycle to go to the coast or the village. Restaurant and shop on site. That is very nice. One star less because it is quite difficult to park. Note the trees with low hanging branches.
16059,2578498,5,Javylore,15/02/2023,"We only stayed 1 night and it cost us 20.50, two people in a van and electricity. You have to leave a cash deposit for the entry card (5 euros) and an extension cord in our case (20 euros), when you leave they will return it to you. We found it quite good, everything super clean and the girls at the reception very nice and helpful, they even gave me a sticker that we loved."
16059,2567393,4,Vikingson,03/02/2023,"Very well maintained campsite. The toilet blocks are very clean. All services imaginable. The counterpart is a densely occupied campsite, with sometimes tricky manoeuvres. Very professional welcome, provided you know that departures are before noon. There are no reservations, which gives truly nomadic motorhomes a chance."
16059,2558734,4,Sin.deentrega,23/01/2023,"we only spent one night. We thought, for the short time we stayed, that it was quite good. AC, two people and electricity €19 with ACSI. The services are very clean and new. If it is true that both access, entrance, etc. A bit tight. Super friendly at reception."

16059,2479920,4,wolfkorn,03/11/2022,A nice well-kept campsite. Clean new plumbing. At our time not much going on so very quiet. The paths are difficult to navigate for larger mobile homes. It was still possible for our Womo 7 meters.
16059,2470241,2,Snoopy85,30/10/2022,"very cramped campsite entrance, no places to park the time to register, the places are difficult to access in a motorhome .... fortunately we went to see if it was suitable ... to get to this campsite on a narrow road with a small ravine on the side, for almost two kms...we left without regrets"

Recent and very clean toilets. 15€ per night CC + 2 people without electricity. €5 access card deposit. the only downside the beach is not 800m but 1300m on a narrow and sloping road. Swimming pool closed. We planned 1 night and stayed 3.
16059,2192306,5,SBranch,07/08/2022,"We arrived when it was obviously very busy. We were squeezed in, no problem as only a one night stop over. Toilets and showers excellent, lovely and clean. Mens were horrible by morning though. Pool was lovely. I lively but happy site"
16059,2044064,3,Auscampers,06/07/2022,We stayed 3 nights. Very shady with lots of trees. Very strict with using the coal bbq as we needed to do it at a designated area. The pool is nice with a bar / restaurant

16059,1839124,1,AdrianCastells,19/04/2022,"Camping in the middle of an urbanization with the separation of the concrete plots, very hot, swimming pool closed until summer, and a bit of bad sling, we saw a fight in the restaurant and we did not spend the night."

16059,1772989,2,KKF,04/03/2022,Difficult access for large motorhomes. Some big squares but few. Ideal for campers. The mountainous environment within urbanization. It is not pleasant to walk. We don't stay.
16059,1756861,1,francoise1775,15/02/2022,"Plots for small CC or Van trees on each plot which greatly reduces the installation, if you have a slightly larger CC you will have to take two places, be careful however with low branches. Water refill and emptying not practical. Too bad there is a lot of potential with a little work. We won't be going back."
16059,1741782,2,reisender06,26/01/2022,Technically neat place with all media. Was our alternative place because the sea was full. But dark and in the middle of nowhere. Not a nice vacation spot.
16059,1736641,1,marcethug,18/01/2022,Huge crowded international campsite. On top of each other. Not a word of French or English at the reception. One night but no more ☹️☹️☹️
16059,1687821,4,mathetmath,13/11/2021,"Nice and quiet campsite, we slept very well. The only flaw would be that the pitches are difficult to access because they are bordered by large, low trees."
16059,1664000,1,tioking69,27/10/2021,"Camping away from everything. No views. Dingy pitches. If they go with an AC of more than 4 meters, it is very difficult to move. Correct bathrooms. Correct staff."
16059,1657325,2,Mariska07,22/10/2021,"We did not like this campsite. Very poorly maintained, dead leaves not picked up, old cigarette ends on the pitches. No maintenance ... sanitary facilities clean enough but not ""neat"", no hooks in the showers. ""Open"" emptier, dirty containers placed next to the sanitary blocks. The campsite is not really near the beaches. If you don't need to be at this campsite, go your way ..."
16059,1427244,4,LaBambinaBracha,09/08/2021,"A campsite to go, plots of land but of good sizes, there are bathrooms every little bit and with chemical toilets in almost each one, the pool with great water temperature, with the covid theme you have to reserve and you can 2h a day, 15 min before you have to leave to disinfect the entire area, if there is a gap the following hours you can go without problem. There is a churrería at the beginning of the campsite, a supermarket with super rich bread. I would definitely go back again."
16059,1363036,4,juanenviar,25/07/2021,"We stayed one night and we really liked the camping. The only downside we can put is that we had to walk to look for the plot before entering with the car and for the shower you have to keep the button pressed or you run out of water, but hey we would go again without a doubt."
16059,1330175,4,Califurgo,16/07/2021,A little old campsite but with all the comforts. Very clean bathrooms with no crowds. He has a churreria in the morning. Fabulous treatment from the campsite staff

16059,1148007,4,Bummelsachse,07/03/2021,"We found the place to be good. The wash houses are cleaned regularly and the kiosk is open every day. The places are big, yes there are trees, you just have to be careful The operators are nice. The sea and the promenade are easy to reach by bike."
16059,1143020,1,bcfcamper,26/02/2021,"Worse place I've ever been. Hard to park, completely full of trees with low hanging branches. During the stay of 2 days saw several fights, very grim atmosphere. Lots of noise at all hours and zero respect for covid-19."
16059,1102961,2,Guyane,23/10/2020,"Not found terrible! Soft sandy coating, many low trees, clean sanitary facilities but 2 showers, one of which does not close, 1st day lukewarm water, 2nd day cold water. Torrox, blah, in short will not come back to it."

16059,228203,4,mogette,18/03/2018,"Very advantageous with the ACSI card. In March 15 € / day. It is necessary to choose the location, the best placed being at the top. We had 528 to give an example. Sanitary clean. Exemplary campground, at least then."
16059,227615,3,romoli71,14/03/2018,"It's fine, clean bathroom, hot water for the shower, warm for the dishes. Home in French, Resto, small convenience store at the entrance. Ideally it takes a motorcycle or a car, far from everything, bike not very well. I had to clean my site myself. Holes, piles of leaves. I would recommend the owner to clean and equalize the pitches after each departure as is done elsewhere."

Free, otherwise it's super good."

Sanitary facilities were poor - no toilet paper in both mens & woman’s toilets, only one shower to share between 90 or so sites, was smelly and both toilets and showers were definitely not cleaned regularly.

Despite the fact that we have had the bad luck that they have taken a deckchair that we have left outside and another 2 chairs. But they seem to have been coming here very often for years and they quietly leave things outside and no one has ever touched them. So we will think that it has been punctual.

16090,1856789,2,Mekong,27/04/2022,"The location is particularly convenient for Via Verde cyclists. BUT the traffic noise: We booked 4 nights but fled after 2 nights. From early in the morning until late in the evening, 40-ton lorries thunder past the mobile homes every 30 seconds on the A-318. At night approx. every 5 minutes."
16090,1837043,3,JABUINPA,19/04/2022,"The reception is very slow since it is the same as for bike rental, and we had to wait half an hour. Good site and location, and the town can be reached on foot in 15 minutes. Few toilets and showers for so many people, and they are not cleaned frequently nor is the paper and soap replenished. Even so, it is appreciated that the town hall has such an area, but for a little more they would have a top area"
16090,1834884,3,jalomur,18/04/2022,"Good initiative of the Town Hall, our case arriving on Saturday we had to pay the full weekend, although it was difficult to find a caravan area for 7e. The bad thing is that we stayed for dinner thinking that the fence opens recognizing the license plate like in other places but it is not like that, they open it with a remote control and from 8 o'clock there is no one in the cycle tourism center so we had to sleep outside."
16090,1832040,5,VanesaRoberto,17/04/2022,"wonderful, attention of 1st, quiet, outdoors, clean toilets, pleasant place, large plots."
16090,1811697,1,KaneloAntonio,09/04/2022,Area of land with trees very difficult to park and far from the town
16090,1808461,4,rosmail,06/04/2022,"Great little spot. Very basic facilities. The tourist office to pay for your ticket is right by the site, not in town."
16090,1808369,4,JensRonn,06/04/2022,"This is the second time we will be visiting Doña Mencía in 2022.
First time 3 days and this time 2 days.
We wished we could stay here several days but all spots were fully booked.
We had some issues with our prebooking of light connection. In the beginning, the person at the reception stated that there were no plugs available, which we could see was untrue and eventually we got power connected.

16090,1806205,4,CagouilleExpress,04/04/2022,Practical area for strolling on via Verde by bike or on foot which is really very very pleasant. We paid 7€ per night 3€ for electricity. The toilets are clean. By cons paid shower as often in Spain. Pay attention to the opening hours because it is impossible to return when there is no one so we spent one night in the parking lot in front of the area.
16090,1805174,4,Scorpios,03/04/2022,"good cp with amenities. the rented bikes are not of top quality, especially the battery does not last 4 hours..... nevertheless had nice days. book during weekends and high season! there is a fixed rate of 7 euros for the weekend, whether you stay 1 or 2 nights. restaurant nearby recommended."
16090,1802917,5,juanini,01/04/2022,great place Some noise in peak traffic hours but worth it for the environment. Large plots. Greenway right next to it. Possibility to rent bicycles. And an obligatory visit to the wine museum of Bodegas Mencianas. Thank you Ms Mencia!!!! We will be back

16090,1772488,3,Arkaravan,03/03/2022,"It is a large area although being attached to the road you can hear a lot of cars, trucks ... the environment and being able to rent bikes is also perfect the children's park but the management ... of the two times I have gone many Problems due to the issue of light, a lot of time to manage, should improve this aspect, since if you arrive late, the issue becomes quite heavy."
16090,1772127,3,Albertronic,03/03/2022,"Very noisy place to be, next to the busy road. Large plots. Playground. Quite a few options in terms of bicycle rental, even for children. Electricity €3. Parking €3. Free emptying and filling, but it's inside the fence. The land of the town hall, management of the cycling center. It is frequent that they are absent. I had to wait half an hour to manage arrival."
16090,1772124,5,leomo2407,03/03/2022,"A nice pitch. Nice staff, clean toilets. The shower (1€) was unfortunately cold because too many people showered one after the other. Electricity 3€. Playground right next door. In the village free fast wifi and a large playground. The staff is there from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., after that you should register online, but unfortunately that doesn't work at the moment."
16090,1771640,5,Bushtrece,02/03/2022,"I think it's the best camping park I've ever been to. Quiet, with all services and beautiful surroundings. Highly recommend bringing bikes if you can. If not, you can rent them there because it is in the middle of the oil greenway. The downside is that sometimes at night you can hear the road a little"
16090,1757109,4,pepepepone,15/02/2022,"second night spent in this area, and very good, with all the services and in the process of improvement, strategic place, for biking and hiking a restaurant next door and a town close to Doña Mencia and on foot or by bike you can go to the other town with charm zuheros, thanks to the town hall, better reserve a place"
16090,1752888,3,JAS21ONTOUR,11/02/2022,"We stayed a week because we liked the cycling.  Somebody staying at the site opened the gate for us and they also cleaned the facilities, but when they left nobody cleaned for 3 days and people were left waiting outside the gate.   On the weekend the site was full and the shower was soon cold. Beware electricity is only 6A supply.  The staff are friendly and approachable but they need more help."
16090,1750969,3,francordoba,08/02/2022,"(Requires prior reservation through the web form) Area in good condition, €3 per night, with bathrooms (not very well maintained) and shower (€1/4min). Level and large plots, ideal for getting to know the area. I don't give more stars because of the disastrous staff... closing and leaving before the hour and forcing us to find our lives to gain access (Thanks to the tourist office we were finally able to enter)"
16090,1732850,3,maloox89,12/01/2022,"On first sight and on ""paper"" the place looks good and for 3€ per night seems a bargain...but toilets are very dirty and open to everyone not only customers, we stayed 2 nights so over 3 days never cleaned and road is very noisy.
Good shower 1€ for 4 minutes very hot.
Dish washing area only cold water and uninspiring.
Would rather spend a little more but have clean and hygienic sanitary blocks."
16090,1711932,3,marielcaramel,18/12/2021,"Looks okay, nice pitches, but directly on a highly frequented road. It was too loud for us, so we didn't stay."
16090,1704928,4,Jorge02,06/12/2021,"A good place to visit the area is a covered campsite for € 3, the only downside is very good, and hopefully it never happens, it is in case of evacuation, it is very complicated because some places cover others but otherwise fine and you can rent bicycles to go by the green way to zuheros"
16090,1698050,5,Katiova,26/11/2021,very well organized area with all kinds of services shower bathroom laundry and and sink. You have to register in advance on the website of the City Council and it has a restaurant next door (in November it is closed from 7 in the afternoon). around 10 the baker comes. Very wide spots of light with a power of 10A.
16090,1690598,5,javilugu,16/11/2021,"A highly recommended stop, you have to make a small reservation online that in a few minutes they answered us, the staff of the cycling route (where you pay € 3 per night and € 1 shower) very nice, well-kept bathrooms and facilities."
16090,1688620,4,Letspgr,14/11/2021,"Very good initiative of the city council! 3 eur / night + 3 eur / electricity + 1 eur / hot shower. Next to the greenway of oil, it is essential to go to Zuheros, a beautiful town. A bit noisy being on the side of the road and the toilets not very clean. Very well located and good vibes in the area."
16090,1681991,3,dora63,08/11/2021,"Friendly welcome, services for CC, bike path nearby. But actually very close road with a lot of noise, except between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m."
16090,1681249,5,leiremclouis,07/11/2021,"One of the best areas I have ever visited. Shaded, level and large pitches plus easy access. Weekend without electricity, only 7 euros. At the foot of the greenway, to visit zuheros and doña Mencía. Doña Mencía makes free guided tours, ending in a winery .... A show"
16090,1680601,3,jesushinojo,06/11/2021,The services a bit dirty. We stopped to fill the water only. We pay nothing

16090,1660061,5,Fco.Aparicio,24/10/2021,"Highly recommended area. € 3 per night and electricity apart. It is advisable to reserve to have a point of light. It is paid at the Cycling Center ... attended by Antonio. Very friendly and helpful person. We recommend the route to Zuheros, one of the most beautiful town in Spain. This weekend it was half full. We will repeat without a doubt."

16090,1637290,1,rafaydana,10/10/2021,"It is no longer a motorhome area. Nor is it a campsite, even if it pretends to be. It is also not a car park. The caravans occupy 3 spaces: the caravan, the trailer / awning and the car that pulls it. The area is full of cars and caravans. It looks like the parking lot of a fairground. It is a shame. It is a pity. We will not be back."
16090,1635156,1,Delfint695,09/10/2021,"Total disaster, at least today. Here you have to reserve to enter, but the staff has not respected it, and those who, like me, come doing a tourist route, when we have arrived at 2:00 p.m., trusting in the reservation, we find ourselves without a site. They tell me to wait they are going to fire someone who does not have a reservation confirmation, but I do not like bad vibes, so we left."
16090,1616975,5,cdiazc,29/09/2021,Very nice place to stay. Very good and cheap services. € 1 for the shower. € 3 to sleep. € 3 for electricity. Benches and tables to eat and direct access to the greenway.
16090,1597893,5,Roselvv,21/09/2021,"Nice area with all the necessary services, super clean and well-kept bathrooms. Good shade, ideal for bikes because the oil route crosses right in the middle. The only downside I see is that it is at the foot of the road and there is a lot of noise at bedtime."
16090,1591894,5,DaniLongWay,19/09/2021,"Almost perfect place to come as a family. Visit to the castle, archaeological museum and wine museum for free. Greenway for cycling or hiking trails. You can't ask for more for less. There is also a bar next door where you can order take-out, specialists in grilled meat."
16090,1587486,5,Luniguel,17/09/2021,"Very good area with all services. You pay 3 euros, and if you want electricity you pay 3 euros more. Despite the nearby road, we slept well. And if you are also a cycling lover, you will love the rental store they have. Very cool routes."
16090,1566414,3,chrisetbruno,10/09/2021,For one night it's fine there are locals who live here and not too welcoming
16090,1563379,5,ovillalibre,09/09/2021,Perfect place to spend the night. It only costs € 3 / day (plus another € 3 if we want to connect to the electricity). You can also empty gray and black water. The pitches are very clean and the space is very pleasant. Perhaps the only one but is that it is next to a road with some traffic but you sleep well.
16090,1560649,5,VanessaAlvarado,08/09/2021,"At the foot of the Greenway of Oil. Nice pitches. Possibility of cycling and walking routes. We really like this site. To put a downside to say that the road passes in front of the area, but we, inside the motorhome, did not bother us."
16090,1544391,2,pacodevalencia,03/09/2021,"At the beginning we have the illusion of a perfect place… but… during the Covid period, showers and XV closed! And in addition it is at the edge (tidal edge) of a busy road. Adepts of calm, go out to sea. The restaurant next door is nice."

16090,1139707,4,RafaelJimenezManzano,20/02/2021,"Great area, ideal for a bike route. The only downside being that being close to the race traffic noise from vehicles even at night despite the curfew."
16090,1131105,5,valerie78,16/01/2021,"Great place for people who like to do bike routes since it is attached to a greenway. It has all the services, we had breakfast in the bar (old station) where the toast and the treatment were 10. We rested very well although if there is perhaps a negative point it is that the road next door is heavily traveled by heavy trucks."
16090,1123801,5,AntonioyAna,25/12/2020,"The area is very well located, greenway, close to town and super cheap. The day costs 3 euros, 7 on the weekend and 3 euros for electricity. We will repeat without a doubt !!!!!"

16090,933413,4,rimorico,05/08/2020,"Almost flat terrain, comfortable filling, emptying and black facilities (free if you are passing through). You pay right next to it. Baker comes in the morning. Two considerations: dusty soil and municipal workers working hard, the way I was: watering truck, electric logger, hard-packed with compactor ... infernal noise. Good afternoon."
16090,848963,5,ArcaDream,04/07/2020,"Quiet and very nice place. Although the road passes nearby, it is not very busy and the best are the bike or hiking routes that start from here. The subbetica cycle route passes, the second longest in Spain. Price: € 7 parking € 3 / day for electricity. The bathrooms are now closed for prevention. There are about 30 places, 10 places with light."
16090,820631,5,Krissa33,10/06/2020,"Very pleasant, shaded. Calm on weekdays, but busy on weekends. I had already come last year, since there are terminals for electricity. They also accept caravans."

16090,790019,4,AmandaTres,02/03/2020,"Good area with services such as public toilets and shower (the latter for 1 euro). It has a cost of 3 euros from 12 to 12 in the morning. When we arrived, the place where you pay was closed, but you can park and pay when it is open (at 10 in the morning). The noise of the road is heard a little, but in general very well."
16090,789610,4,Auxiliar02,01/03/2020,"Good area. the only thing is that the road is heard a lot. You pay for bicycles. the light was caught by the first ones who arrived. The town is fine, only that there are many dog poops, it is impossible to walk without looking. Hopefully the municipalities are encouraged to put areas everywhere. we have been very satisfaced."
16090,789295,3,acuita78,01/03/2020,Quiet area where we sleep well. At the foot of the bike path with services open during the bike rental shop. Show a € 1 4 minutes. We had a great time.
16090,787756,5,alhucemar,27/02/2020,"Despite the proximity of the road and the only source of night noise, it is a great example of adaptation and integration of an area of a municipality in the Subbética NP with many possibilities for activities in a natural protected environment. Do not forget the bikes because it is at the foot of the Greenway of the Oil."
16090,776951,4,RamonKTF,06/02/2020,It is still in the phase of improvements and expansion. The electrical outlet points will be extended. Do not forget to get the ticket at the bike rental shop. Very nice staff.

16090,774377,4,luifer,31/01/2020,"We have spent 2 days, the area is fine, the rent of closed bicycles, the closed toilets, the beautiful green road, the regular town had never seen so many dog poops on the ground you could not look at the houses you would not step on one, but it is Agusto in the area, you eat normar in the restaurant but for the price they charge you can not ask for more."

Flat terrain and allow caravans. Worse, the laundry area has the floor drain behind, who uses it to know that the soap you use goes directly to the ground, herbs ... Nothing environmentally friendly"

Gets very busy on Friday and Saturday nights, but earlier in the week blissfully quiet. Potentially electric hook up points near the toilets, mounted on a tree/lamppost (although not tested). To recommend."

The area is paid to the green road of the subbeticas, near the town of Zuheros (highly recommended to visit) the cave of the Muecielagos, the station of Cabra, ... the baker passes every day about ten in the morning except the Sundays. Ideal for families because of the natural and quiet environment, it has swings and a children's area. On the pier you can taste the local wine (Montilla-Moriles) and grilled meats."

16090,570152,2,Fryzo,23/07/2019,"Quiet area, too bad it has coincided that they are under construction and consideration for those who are stationed is rather little. Everything is dry due to high temperatures and some maintenance is lacking. It can be night but currently not advisable to spend the day."
16090,507747,5,koma1980,08/06/2019,"Excellent area, very beautiful, located in the green way! Free Light connection € 3."
16090,490441,5,Vikipe,23/05/2019,"An area of 10, quiet, familiar place, to repeat. Sorry that the services are not yet available. I recommend it."
16090,489591,5,Krissa33,21/05/2019,"Super, flat places, shade, sun, there is something for everyone. Thank you to the Municipality. Only problem: the place for services is not yet in use. The road is noisy during the day but it's quiet at night. Beautiful walks for dogs"
16090,476291,4,JoMac39,05/05/2019,"Thanks to the town hall for a motorhome area on the greenway. Very neat and with restaurant next to this. a pity that people are the ones who in the end we load, in the place where I put there was a dog poop. and on Sunday morning, I caught one who was letting the dog piss near my van. The one that wants to have dog that shits in its plot."
16090,465369,5,brammers,23/04/2019,Fantastic site right next to the Via Verde cycleway. Some gravel and many grassy pitches. Our dogs enjoyed playing on the grass. Footpaths lead from the cycleway into the national park next door. Some traffic noise as the site is adjacent to the main road but it's quiet at night. Watch out in the rain as the ground gets soft and slippy away from the gravel. Tourist information boards In English
16090,460532,5,ikirmai77,20/04/2019,"Nice area On the ""green road"" for bicycles or walking. The village is also near. Stupid area from where the greenway leaves. Town near"
16090,455972,5,fondistak,16/04/2019,"Recommended area. Much room, wide spaces. Picnic tables, water, a bar-restaurant (quite crowded). The greenway: highly recommended to do well walking (even with children), with a bike, running ... A road passes next, but at night there is not much traffic. Without a doubt, an area that should be taken care of."
16090,454169,4,cheteac,13/04/2019,"Very nice and nice area, with grass and swings for children, they are also finishing the work for emptying gray and black water. It is true that the road passed very close, but at night there is hardly any traffic and you do not even know. We saw it by chance and we stayed two nights. Thanks to the Doña Mencía City Council for these services."
16090,429981,3,carogo,16/02/2019,"Flat area, clean, with water and playground. Along the greenway, nice to talk with walkers and quiet after dark. By cons, the road below is quite noisy all night. The village of Zuheros is a must visit (and maybe the parking at the foot of Zuheros to spend the night, no service but a breathtaking view!)"
16090,425160,4,debbiefletch,27/01/2019,Brilliant stop over bang next door to via verde - access to water and electricity - 3 euros a night.  Close to la cantina restaurant which opens at 7 am.  Waste disposal less ideal.  Stayed 4 nights!
16090,422290,5,Evajilo,13/01/2019,"The site is great, there are many places, with lawn, benches, litter bins, water point. To release gray water may be its neglect point, is on the road crossing and is not very well prepared, since it is in slope and the water goes to other sides. Although it is next to the road it does not bother to sleep, to the other side it is beautiful, and it crosses the greenway area, which is very busy and encourages to take or rent bikes, which can be rented there. Nearby is Zuheros, very nice too and the Cave of the bats has surprised us. We will be back."
16090,420084,3,javisa75,04/01/2019,A very comfortable area for parking spaces. A canteen right next door. The town is crossed by a passage under the highway. The worst is the emptying of gray and black water. Very badly located. In fact we went to see him walking and there was just a car parked in front. Our ac does not fit for grays. And it is a bit piggy to put black in a sewer without tap. Thank you for providing space!
16090,417810,3,capf18,30/12/2018,"Very wide area and easy access, the only problem is that it is attached to the highway and is quite noisy to sleep as they do not stop spending cars during the night. Another drawback is that the drain of dirty water is on the other side of the road and is badly located (sewer on bicycle lane with cars parked in front) impossible to use since the van did not fit."
16090,413355,4,violetaloz,10/12/2018,"Free service area, on the other side of the town across the road. There is to fill water and a sink to scrub. Behind the bike rental building there is a box to catch light. The waters are emptied when leaving in a chest of an avenue. Bar at the entrance. Parking between trees and near greenway"
16090,412608,3,martincr,07/12/2018,"Well delimited and located. Right on the edge of the greenway. I do not understand that the emptying services are where they are, but thanks for the area."
16090,409251,5,migueldira666,21/11/2018,"Spacious area in a quiet and beautiful place with easy access. In the immediate vicinity a restaurant where you can eat at a reasonable price. You can practice sports hiking and cycling. For the emptying of black and gray water you have to cross the road, it is a sewer and it is signposted, you have to be aware because the signal is somewhat hidden."
16090,403986,5,rafaparrado,03/11/2018,"The area is great, close to the town, in the middle of nature, next to the greenway of the Subbetica."
16090,393381,5,gachero,14/10/2018,"Free camping area next to the greenway, you can rent bicycles to walk along this route, the guys who serve you are super friendly. Paste: you have to go to the other side of the road to drop gray and black although they told us that it is already approved to do work and pass it next to the camping area. Good tapas at the chiringuito next door. Ideal for families with children"
16090,254575,2,zimarc2017,17/05/2018,"OK for the pleasant greenway, but we did not like the place: too noisy by the road, no services on, not top view. Motorhomes stuck to each other."
16090,239798,4,Britania,22/04/2018,Stayed here for a night excellent place with the via verde just behind. Great views and nearby cantina the only downside is the grey and black water services are over the roundabout and on the other side of the road but water is available nearby.
16090,226100,5,critom07,06/03/2018,"Very nice place and well exposed (despite the proximity of the road). We stayed 2 nights. Beautiful walks on the greenway. Shops in the village. Water, drain and electricity on site. What more ?"
16090,220641,3,Urko,29/01/2018,"Calm and pleasant place. There is a bicycle rental managed by the City Council, who provide several electricity supply points for € 3 / day. The staff extremely friendly. Just behind the bicycle rental building, you have the water intake. The only important downside is the emptying of gray and black which is very uncomfortable and you do not have water to clean the black cassette."
16090,220500,3,centrodelsur,28/01/2018,"Nice area next to the Greenway. There is a nearby restaurant and the town center within a 10 minute walk. Available electricity and water. What is worse thought is the emptying of both gray and black, which is located on the other side of the road."
16090,219131,1,chuskygijon,17/01/2018,"The services of water and emptying of gray / black are separated by the road and also for emptying the grid (one for all) and without a tap to be able to clear the poty. It was just a technical stop, we did not sleep there, but until it's all together I will not stop there again."
16090,213856,5,carlosutrera,07/12/2017,Very quiet place if it were not for the noise of the road at 20 meters. There are only 3 points of light (€ 3). The police spend every 4-5 hours to control.
16090,204032,3,Torroles,18/10/2017,"This area belongs to Doña Mencía, Zuheros is the next town. Just to not create confusion. Say that it is a good area next to the greenway."
16090,191603,5,Pedromazorko,09/09/2017,"The site is highly recommended, it has shade, the electricity is contracted for € 3 a day, it is provided by the bicycle rental. It has to empty the dirty, this on the other side of the road, it is indicated. In the dirty room blacks can be emptied, not an employee of the town hall said as it is the sanitary sewer. For € 10 menu and pool at the hotel"
16090,146077,4,nelipq,27/06/2017,A very nice place to spend the night.
16090,134493,3,alba49,12/05/2017,Well laid out site. Fresh water tap but no grey water nor chemical disposal. Very noisy and busy road right at the side. Town and shops 20 minute walk away.

16090,119476,5,juankau2,06/02/2017,"Magnificent parkin area on the mountainside, with magnificent walking routes, mountain biking on the old asphalt road. And the great possibility of visiting the beautiful town of zueros and its caves, as well as the possibility of parking in the Zuheros car park just at the beginning of the river bailon route, with magnificent views."
16090,115596,3,Almacar,07/12/2016,On the other side of the road and away from the town to walk. Only close to a restaurant if you arrive at night.
16090,88125,4,larryvigo,02/08/2016,"A good place to spend a few days, attached greenway, and the town very close. It only lacks a place to empty the waters. Free !!"
16090,72440,4,crazytess,09/05/2016,"This is the village of Dona Mencia, 4 km from Zuheros, but at the exit of the greenway. The place between lawn and trees very nice, there is only water. There is no empty gray water. It is next to the office to rent bicycles."
16090,70370,5,MOY,26/04/2016,Excellent quality and good price with the best views
16090,60694,3,mirabelle9,05/12/2015,"Nice area, close to a popular restaurant. It's a good sign. One regret, the road passes 100 m. Beautiful paths for walks"
16090,57567,3,phatn1,15/10/2015,"A nice quiet area may be a little noisy depending on traffic (due to the nearby main road). Water is available and the electrical connection (3 € / 24h) To ask the bike center. Wastewater can be emptied easily. (Ask the bike center). The local police often go around to check if everything is calm and in order (= increased security). A nice stopover if you want to visit the ""Via Verde Subbetica"" (Subbetica greenway) a 60 km trail that can be done on foot or by bike through the olive groves (ancient route of Olices traversed by an oil train .) to discover the beautiful small villages of the province of Córdoba ..

16122,3280585,1,gangerlfamily,10/09/2023,"Quite a strange area, strong smell and quite run down. It was enough to empty the gray water and toilet, and we drove on to spend the night."
16122,3202089,1,Adricollage,22/08/2023,It's a shame the bad smell. It is a place of passage or a last minute solution if the other sites are full.
16122,3182588,5,nathalieleg,19/08/2023,Plenty of room and very quiet.
16122,3181075,4,Mirpe,19/08/2023,Adequate to be able to see the town and stop for a night or two.
16122,3147406,4,Andrea-Dinis,14/08/2023,Very spacious area with views of the estuary. The downside is that it smells a bit bad. Regular filling and emptying area
16122,3125838,2,CarlesRoig82,11/08/2023,"Very neglected place, unhygienic and a lot of noise, train, plane, a dog from a house that does not stop barking. I recommend emptying and filling and finding another place to sleep."
16122,3105376,3,oriolrue,09/08/2023,"If you don't have another option, it's good to spend the night, but keep in mind that it's a noisy place, cars, trains, planes, no bad smell, there's a shower on the beach, cold water but it's good to cool off"
16122,3104569,4,jordiadrian,08/08/2023,Quiet place to sleep. It seems that there are some cars and caravans that are there all year round. area for emptying and filling water a bit careless but it can be done. Thanks to the town hall for thinking of us and enabling an area for Cars that are not abundant in the area.
16122,3083988,4,Happyzafi,05/08/2023,"Good place, it is not idyllic but with everything as it is, it is to thank the people of this town for maintaining it and providing the services. In good weather it is a nice place!"
16122,3046671,5,MarkHarley,30/07/2023,"Idyllic place, with all the services next to it, (clean water and emptying of dirty ones) the only drawback is the treatment plant, but it does not influence. the beach next door, children's park, beach bar, restaurant next door. There are two guys who live in their respective caravans who are very nice, any questions you have you can ask them without problem, they are from the area. I recommend it."
16122,3033754,3,ze.balca,28/07/2023,Good enough to spend the night.
16122,3027431,2,Paichi,27/07/2023,"It is appreciated having an area in this area that is rather scarce, but we had so much disgust dealing with the black water sewer, the terrible smell, the poorly defined clean water tap and the cassette itself, that we decided to go far away, very far away and with half a boat of nenuco on top to forget all that"
16122,2963709,1,miguelro,14/07/2023,"The place is very pretty but it is right next to the sewage treatment plant and just below there is a dirty water discharge, which falls directly into the estuary, generating a very unpleasant smell."
16122,2922795,5,FurgoCemi,04/07/2023,Quiet place to sleep with good views.
16122,2853034,4,Laritacs,14/06/2023,"It is located in a very good area with a walk and park for children. The restaurants in the area offer exquisite food. It offers views of the sea but they are not the best in the area, it is full of seaweed. It's fine to spend the day. Good services and quiet area."
16122,2837604,4,autocaravanariga,09/06/2023,"Place a sloppy and bad-smelling pruning in the part where the water is changed because there are people who empty the WC deposit where they shouldn't. Some motorhomes that seem to have been there all their lives. Outside of this liquid change area there is no bad smell and there are many places. I wouldn't have a problem sleeping there, although this time we didn't because we were passing through."
16122,2836036,3,KellyyMiguel,09/06/2023,We only went to clean deposits ... Site a bit neglected
16122,2723626,3,mafo111,04/05/2023,quiet place to spend the night next to the sea gardens playgrounds sports area but at night quiet...
16122,2718836,2,Northern_Fjells,03/05/2023,"Place with a great location by the sea, but right next to a sewage treatment plant, so it smells a bit and a lot of mosquitoes. An overnight stay can only be recommended with the windows closed. The fresh water connection also smelled a bit strong, which is why I would not use it. So more of a parking space in a beautiful village."
16122,2580689,4,FurgoCelta,17/02/2023,"It is a somewhat neglected and lawless area. But it offers you the services of emptying black, gray and filling with water. It is level, good views, nearby playground and restaurants. There are permanently installed caravans that are families with low economic resources but they are calm and do not mess with anyone."
16122,2524924,2,javiers,20/12/2022,"Although the place is quiet, there is a fetid and penetrating smell that cannot even be tolerated, at least in the rainy season, when it seems that all the town's sewers flow into the estuary. There are seagulls flying around to see if they can catch something from the sewer."
16122,2520588,2,MonicaGarciaDiaz,12/12/2022,"Normal area. Emptying and filling little care and old but it does its job. It is next to the WWTP, we did not smell anything or make any noise. Well located in the town next to the estuary."

16122,2433643,2,elimax,09/10/2022,"It's a very good pitch. Unfortunately, the sewage treatment plant smelled very strongly. After a walk 6 km south we drove to a parking lot. Very nice location on the beach but no service."
16122,2308640,3,Banditcd,27/08/2022,"We have been two days and one night with a lot of uncertainty due to the written comments and I can say that at night there was no noise or smell, that is, first thing in the morning when the WWTP operators start working there was some smell and a bit of noise from machinery working, there are worse places out there... The children's park is great and the Casa Do Muelle restaurant is a blast."
16122,2300679,1,FernandoVilela,25/08/2022,How is it possible for an area that should be resting and located in a place free from pollution to be located next to a sewage treatment plant? No minimum conditions! A shame!
16122,2287913,1,jordaco,23/08/2022,"Quiet place???...not at all. Very noisy area of cars, planes, people and the sewage treatment plant with its smell. There are two fixed caravans that have been with a very bad image for quite some time. I'm not coming back!!!"
16122,2287602,3,DragonetaBCN,23/08/2022,"The parking area is fine, quite busy with motorhomes when we went. At night a car passed by several times speeding up and playing loud music to annoy those of us who were there. When they finally got tired, quiet night. Despite being next to the sewage treatment plant, we did not hear any noise, as they say in previous comments."
16122,2287260,2,tata13,22/08/2022,"Site to upload and download. Gratuitous. Parking not very nice, but quiet. Perfect for a day at the beach or a walk around town. It has no shadows."
16122,2254925,1,pattper,17/08/2022,"Strong smell coming from the treatment plant (building next door) Not pleasant at all, just for parking and visiting the city. Funny way to welcome tourists...."
16122,2252401,4,Habibi1978,17/08/2022,"Not bad at all for what you find out there. Perfect gray emptying, normal water filling if you have the adapter, and black emptying a bit dirty by dirty people who are not careful. The charming locals like all Galicians. insignificant noise from the sewage treatment plant and a slight odor. perfect to spend one or two nights and eat some oysters"
16122,2251107,1,GemmaMQ,16/08/2022,"The loading and unloading area does not have separate taps for gray and black water, and at the end you have to put the potis in the same place where you hook the hose to load. The black water discharge site is not very clear, but it looks like a simple drain that ends up in the estuary. The parking area smells like a sewer and is full of flies. It really is a shame because the space is wide and you have a large park next to it. The environment itself is not bad at all and the effort of the council is appreciated, although there is a lot to improve. In the end we have loaded and unloaded and we have not stayed, since the site has not convinced us very much, in addition to the fact that there were some people who were a bit strange."
16122,2251100,2,bg_alberto,16/08/2022,"It does not have well-differentiated intakes between ""clean water intake"" and ""black water intake"". The same water supply point must be used for both. Very flat, well leveled. CHILDREN'S PARK NEAR."

16122,2242385,4,nomadazaca,15/08/2022,"The site is great, quiet and a good walk, to enjoy. It is true that from time to time the sewage treatment plant next door smells, but it is not too unpleasant. The clean water tap is a 3/4 stopcock that is on the left side, not the chrome tap that is for cleaning the poti."
16122,2217911,3,Sin.deentrega,11/08/2022,"The discharge of sewage clearly to improve. The area in general is not bad, views of the estuary, promenade, park, beach, bars and the town has everything. For us the noise of the sewage treatment plant is the worst, I parked as far as possible from the walls of the sewage treatment plant. Thanks to the town hall"
16122,2210571,3,pp7,10/08/2022,"Too many people in Pontevedra, no room for a single van...we go on our way.. So much the better.. Small car park facing the sea.. Small excellent seafood restaurant."
16122,2190411,3,alicia2022,07/08/2022,"nice place. The entrance is a bit strange. we slept one night, fine. The only thing to say is that several caravanists play music and take out chairs, you have to take care of places like this. not overdo it far from supermarkets."
16122,2122664,4,kuboonroad,25/07/2022,The place is quite good with views of the estuary. Basic loading and unloading services. With a park and several bars to have a drink. The smells are those that usually exist in ports but nothing serious and quite bearable. Small beach in the estuary a few meters from the car park

16122,2034519,4,1aventurade5,03/07/2022,"There is no emptying of black water, only gray water and there is drinking water. The topic of the smell, today is our third day and although it is annoying at times, it is not unbearable in the least. A few meters away there is a children's park, a very nice promenade, soccer and basketball courts, and a skatepark that is not worth it. But overall it's fine."

Manicured garden crowded on Sundays."
16122,1799217,1,lasskris,28/03/2022,Totally terrible place. It is a public car park where RVs are allowed and there is disposal. It smells unpleasant and the environment is dingy. Let's get out of here quickly!
16122,1769900,3,jubelle31,01/03/2022,Night of 02/27/22. Free and there are all the services (water and gray and black water drains) BUT the site is really noisy and VERY stinky because the building next to the service area is a wastewater treatment plant:/ Too bad because the view is superb

Cars have been parked at the place of loading and unloading water and there is no water on the tap, local police do not work on Sundays and cannot be loaded or unloaded or fined. An organizational disaster and disrespect"
16122,1690295,4,Bulma80,15/11/2021,"We slept on the other side of the building because there was a lot of noise when we got through the park next door, although the night was quiet."
16122,1542704,3,albanela,03/09/2021,"When we arrived and parked the place was great, with a lot of flat parking, next to the estuary, with services. The bad thing was when we got off, that day the smell was unbearable, we had to go."
16122,1518601,4,JosepS,27/08/2021,Very quiet place and if you move away from the port area there is no bad smell there is a brown / orange building that I don't know exactly what it is but there are civil guard cars and it gives you peace of mind.

16122,1471881,2,fojedo,17/08/2021,"Quiet place, the two drawbacks I see are the noise and the smell that comes out of the Lonja. We parted ways to avoid camera noise but the smell of plofff fish."
16122,1409155,3,robokot,05/08/2021,"It has all the services, there are even soccer fields, basketball courts and a park nearby for children, it would be a good place, but there is a very bad smell, and the feeling it gives is not very good, there are motorhomes there that give the feeling of a settlement , but the area if it were more cared for and guarded is not bad"
16122,1408386,3,tamaraydavid,05/08/2021,"All services are free and there is a water drain. It is a pity that the area is next to the treatment plant because it smells very bad. there are a couple of caravans that are always parked there ... and some nights cars come to spin or play music. the views are very nice, there is a children's playground and a bar nearby, walks along the estuary and public toilets nearby."
16122,1406349,3,autokarramarra,05/08/2021,The proximity to the town and a playground is great. It is a good parking lot to stop for the day to visit but the feeling to spend the night was not good. There are several Caravans installed by people who live permanently there that did not give us much security. Although we had no complaints either. It is simply a sensation. The smell of the estuary was sometimes a bit unpleasant.
16122,1356698,2,enriqueadv,24/07/2021,"If the police do not control those who are installed in the caravans, this area will be left without visitors."
16122,1354959,4,krisjov,23/07/2021,"Very nice, quiet place, too bad we found bad weather .. the public toilets are 300m near the kiosk, while for showers there are only those on the beach but it is forbidden to do them with shampoo! For the rest it is a place that deserves! Too bad about the stench of the port drains!"
16122,1353122,1,AgustinMaya,22/07/2021,"An area disaster, there are some madmen installed fixed with a caravan with a music festival that they do not respect, impossible to rest! Not recommended for spending the night !!! What a shame of people! IM not coming back anymore !"
16122,1344885,4,ventaniella,20/07/2021,"Nice area to spend the night, discharge of gray and dirty water. It is free and is 4 minutes from downtown. A must have some oysters and a seafood platter. We went to the Arcade Recreation Bar and the treatment was excellent."
16122,1318617,3,IreChi,12/07/2021,They have expanded the area because there is a very large parking lot that can accommodate at least 20 caravans. Close to bathing area and promenade walking very close and a playground right next to it. Basic services. There is an Edar next door. On weekends it is not active but from Monday you can smell the smell.
16122,1277876,2,recor,26/06/2021,Good area with basic services emptying gray water and refueling water. Black and light no. Everything is free. Ample parking for many Ac. We finally did not spend the night there. It smells bad enough to drain / raft and cars do not stop arriving with the young kids in the area to hang out with their music. Nothing quiet if you want to rest.
16122,1234909,4,Madbranquinho,04/06/2021,Quiet and friendly place. We had dinner very well in a restaurant very close to Casa de Muelle.

16122,1042346,4,columpetas,12/09/2020,"Don't worry, it smells a bit like a ""raft"" (not like a drain) but that is normal in some areas where there is seafood, razor clams etc ... if you are from Costa you will understand. for all that well, although the gps makes you sick ... if you do not make the last turn with gps and pull straight ahead you see the area sign"

16122,950255,1,Chiki84,11/08/2020,"It smells really bad. There is a kind of water treatment plant next door. If it were not for that the site is fine, it has to load and unload water. The views are pretty. We left within 10 minutes of arriving because of the bad smell."
16122,936153,3,Catalina19,07/08/2020,"Views of the estuary. paved, easy access. It has gray discharge and water filling but no black discharge. next to the beach, playground, bars, services (on the beach), it has a walk that leads to the Paio bridge and reaches another beach."
16122,889388,1,xiulet,22/07/2020,The best part: the free services. For the rest it is worth nothing. Desangelat. The village has nothing either.
16122,851280,4,mpestana,06/07/2020,"Spacious area with services such as playground, beach, promenade, beach bar, skatepark, skating rink, sports court ... It smells a bit bad, especially at low tide but bearable."
16122,777880,4,abuelopablo,08/02/2020,"As reported slightly smelly but couldn’t smell it inside the van,maybe different in hot weather ! Loads of space and quite a few other vans, nice meal just up the road. Quiet after about 9pm. The police patrol cruises around from time to time."

16122,752415,1,ColinL,10/12/2019,"Arrived 10th December, lovely spot with a great view but the smell from the adjacent sewage works was too overpowering. We lasted 10 minutes before leaving."
16122,718878,3,Tino52,11/10/2019,The area has good views and is quite flat but the trajín of the kids of the town can be unbearable. The very basic filling and emptying area. We do not stay for the incessant scandal.
16122,694333,1,Baillette,17/09/2019,"Indeed the smell is uncomfortable, we fled. Too much parking and beautiful view"
16122,666488,3,GemmaMQ,29/08/2019,"Very spacious area and next to a large park with swings and playground for children. We have not loaded and unloaded waters. The only downside is that it is right where the sewage drains and very often there are odors from the sewage! A pity, otherwise it is fine."
16122,640754,3,netalexworld,18/08/2019,"There is no emptying of blacks, do not vertais them. Only gray water. Let's be civic.Paruq children's for children. Skate park very loud. Sewage car park"
16122,625038,2,felibea,13/08/2019,"It is good to spend the night, the issue of water changes is another story, very left, and the thread to catch water is the other way around, you have to tap with a male."
16122,621340,2,Slowly_p4n,12/08/2019,"Water disposal is possible. Toilet safe, but this is not solved clean. Fresh water is only available from a pressure tap without thread. In addition, there is a hose nozzle with an internal thread that comes out of the ground. So if you have the right adapter, it should be better to refuel here. We fill up here certainly no fresh water. One of the dirtiest stations."
16122,594076,2,ralulz,02/08/2019,"August 2019, super spacious although very bad smells coming from the river. We have decided not to spend the night."
16122,586426,2,gon943,30/07/2019,"By chance, tonight, the hollow metal noise of the nearby Skatepark is unbearable, until 1:00 in the morning and a trailer with the engine started for a while. Smelly day. It would be very acceptable if it does not become the skatepark, the smell was not so bad. There are different nearby and good restaurants and other businesses. Still and everything is worth visiting Arcade."
16122,488606,3,Beaglecamp,20/05/2019,"Great place for a night, nice view. Not much to do and it stinks a bit to sewage treatment."
16122,421648,3,simZone,10/01/2019,"The place and the view are great. Especially if you stand behind the house right on the water. But the service station is one of the dirtiest I've ever seen. Large holes collect the stinking water into which you then inevitably get in. In addition, the faucet is a disaster ... But it was quiet and you can go for a nice walk."
16122,366807,1,agustinypili,07/09/2018,The motorhomes and caravans that are here are from the neighbors that the Nazi party has throughout the year smells bad noise purifying park for dogs with its corresponding pipican all that we have it pegadito.

16122,243161,3,scotspike,29/04/2018,"Nice view, close to town.  All services provided although a bit basic."
16122,238745,3,bifbafbof,20/04/2018,The service area is located in Arcade on the 550 coming from Pontevedra at the traffic light on the right and coming from the south on the left at the traffic light. the services a tap without a screw for the cassette ??? gray ok
16122,228947,4,jannilou,22/03/2018,"Parking area pleasant enough for small walks, good alternative to the population density of Vigo.

16122,218313,4,garyf,09/01/2018,"Plenty of space, clean and very quiet at night. Lovely views and plenty of dog walking. The tap by the waste disposal is almost useless so you will not be able to fill up. I'd stay here again definitely."
16122,213441,4,adonisito1,03/12/2017,"Very pleasant, flat, good views. Access is easy, we are in a large van with trailer. Dumper is ok, dog walk is very good. Water frozen, but we would come back, especially for the scenery. Everything you need in town. No smells in December."
16122,210075,3,ScottandBec,07/11/2017,"Ok spot. Hard to get to as lots of one-way steets that Google maps didn't pick up. On river - tidal, smells a bit. Public WC close by. Parked for lunch but wouldn't bother to stay here overnight."
16122,204789,1,missa33,21/10/2017,"Heavy truck refrain, narrow narrow road to go. With balconies advancing on the floor. Impossible for us to access it and turn maneuver very difficult!"

We liked it, just be careful with the cyclists. The parking lot borders directly on the bike path & then the residents can (rightly) get stinky when you open the door to the bike path."
16180,2769821,2,jayjay99,21/05/2023,"Actually a nice spot if you compare it with the others in the area... However, there was music from a nearby bar until late at night, which was really loud and young people also celebrated loudly here. Definitely nicer here during the week."
16180,2759778,5,Anus,18/05/2023,"Good place to stay for a day or two, not to occupy more than one place. Do not take anything out or open the windows, do not camp or they will throw us out"
16180,2710969,5,zapatillaroja,30/04/2023,"After trying to spend the night at Playa Torn we ended up in this place and it was a success. AC parking area facing the sea, very quiet, clean area, very respectful users, there is a container nearby. Give us a very quiet night, we feel safe. You have the boulevard with restaurants and bars, a pleasant walk and the huge, family-friendly beach. After 8 pm difficult to find a place."
16180,2677590,2,pollhuguetts,17/04/2023,A place where we could not park because of incivility of one of our compatriots. Congratulations on the solidarity between motorhome owners.

16180,2526493,2,Inuk_F,22/12/2022,"The place is nice and quiet, but the arrangement and situation of the parking spaces and the bike path are not suitable. Right now there are two parked ACs taking up more than one space without following the marked lines. I'm leaving, I don't like parking like this. I passed the next day by bike along the lane, there was an AC parked right next to the lane, how do you open the door the moment a silent bike passes by..."

16180,1730633,5,anabel_cupy,09/01/2022,Tranquility despite the wind that always makes in this area. Beach and promenade a few meters. In high season surely less tranquility being on the seafront. No restriction signs.
16180,1726379,5,Ebula,05/01/2022,"Space for about 8 mobile homes directly on the beach side of the street. Even large / long motorhomes can be approached without any problems, no height restrictions.

16180,1585561,2,Marc-In,17/09/2021,The fourth photo doesn't fit the space. It's a hard shoulder right on the promenade. Little parking space. It's not worth it.

16180,1283896,2,carlesgarvel,28/06/2021,"The site is fine, next to the promenade in the first line, but no fine white sand as I have read in another comment, the beach is average. I would highlight the amount of mosquitoes that there are both during the day and at night, something incredible."
16180,1238706,1,berlingomiami,06/06/2021,"Well lit place in front of the sea, but many people making bottles all night and breaking bottles ... Etc .. We have called the municipal and squad mossos 2 h ago and nobody has come ... That makes it a little place safe and very little professionalism on the part of the police ... We will not repeat more!"

16180,753427,3,debycoles,14/12/2019,Lovely views and very quiet. We were there for two nights and really enjoyed it. In December the place is nearly deserted at the beach area. Someone did try and get into our van at 3am the second night. We recommend bringing a big dog. Our extra locks and alarm stopped them.
16180,747512,5,moniquel50,27/11/2019,"Stayed the night from 26 to 27/11/19 very quiet, no noise, just the murmur of the sea. Thanks to the municipality for letting us ask a few moments"

16180,544663,4,Yippiecaster,08/07/2019,"Good to stay the night later. With ""promenade"" which is pretty crowded. After dark, the beach is completely empty, the promenade still populated with self-optimizers. Right on the beach a chemo-loo and shower. Ergo: Beautiful place in the morning first into the sea, but then quickly gone."
16180,447037,2,Lebensglück,31/03/2019,"Quiet to sleep at night. Otherwise busy, because the parking lot forms the loop of a roundabout. Great view of the sea and long paved beach promenade."
16180,443357,4,Jolepapy,23/03/2019,Quiet area with only the sound of the sea. Market on Sunday morning at 500 meters. Nice walk along the sea. In season it is possible that it is full because it is the carpark of the beach and there are many places which are empty in this march

16180,396174,3,Bringamosa,20/10/2018,Location looks promising but at this time of the year the toilets are locked. The beach is right info front of you.
16180,288605,5,jeanclaude77,14/07/2018,"Excellent stay, nice beach, not too busy with shower and toilet. Be careful to stay discreet because the neighborhood does not appreciate the unpacking. We put the awning by parking along the river"
16180,215110,3,Carsten1378,17/12/2017,"Parking on the beach overlooking the sea. Dustbin available. Toilets on the beach 100m, but now closed. A bike path has now been pulled over the parking spaces, so that now much less mobile fit here. Police have tolerated us."

16180,140952,3,califlipo,05/06/2017,"We spent the night last Friday. The place is not very nice, that is, it does not have a fantastic environment, but we sleep super quiet! At around 9 a local police car passed but he did not say anything to us. There was no one in the whole night, neither people nor other campers or ACs. Just us, the beach and the sea. Free."
16180,137259,5,jean-cedric,25/05/2017,Arrived on May 23 I spent two days on the parking very nice place beautiful view of the sea green space not far from the city it feels safe I left the windows of the camper open the day to ventilate on the other hand the parking is slightly inclined but one can find places by looking well to get up to get out the holds

16197,3225270,4,Crisoloz,27/08/2023,"It is an open parking lot, 24 hours are 14.50 in high season, it has a 24-hour bathroom and showers on the beach 5 minutes away for 1 euro. To spend a night it is good and very close to everything."

16197,3199864,4,sorayagc99,22/08/2023,"24 hour guarded parking. The historic center of Cadiz is about a 15-minute walk away, to see the city is quite good. It cost us €14.40 for staying for almost a day. Most of the parking spaces are for cars but there are also a few for AC and vans."
16197,3197706,3,Javicamo,22/08/2023,"The best thing is its location and the tranquility to sleep... If they invested a little in improving the infrastructure it would be perfect. Having no competition is what happens. However, I recommend it."
16197,3196823,1,alexceuta,21/08/2023,"The company that manages the car park leaves much to be desired, they should adapt to the users, for AC of 7m €29/day, without at least offering water and let's not talk about the conditioning of the land, it is a demolition that they made a flat and begin to charge, zero infrastructure."
16197,3173957,4,Fabienemma,18/08/2023,"Ample parking, perfect for motorhomes. Plenty of room despite arriving on a weekend. Train line right next door. 15-20min walk from the beach.

You can't take anything out of the van. 12 hours €14.40 and up to 24 hours the same price for vehicles under 6m. Ideal to go to La Caleta, see the Castle and go to the historic center on foot about 15-20min."
16197,2958854,4,MarLoren,13/07/2023,"Parking with spectacular views of the castle of San Sebastián and Santa Catalina. we slept soundly, fresh and safe. One minute from the beach of La Caleta and two from the neighborhood of La Viña. I am not giving it 5 stars because it does not have filling and emptying services... yes, it is true that there is a WC service next to the guard's booth at the entrance that you can use."
16197,2944575,4,Evatrotera,10/07/2023,"You can park next to the wall with views of the sea. sleeping listening to the sea, we had the bad luck that in the castle that is next door they put on music (as was our case). Well located to go to the beach and visit the old town of Cádiz. No services. You cannot take out any camping elements, it is only parking, but they allow overnight stays. motorhomes price €28.80 for 24 hours."
16197,2942192,1,grberm,09/07/2023,Narrow entrance from the street that leads to the parking lot. There were motorcycles parked on both sides and we couldn't get through. When I was in the castle I was looking at the parking lot and it leaves something to be desired for the price it has

It can be challenging to get there due to the scooters parked on calle Campo de las Balas (we had to move one of them to get through).

Very expensive, if you measure more than 6 meters you pay double the rate. €14x2=€28.80 A robbery. The motorhomes park at the end, possible maneuvers but complex with 6.50m.

16197,2543151,4,eloycarrellan,06/01/2023,"The best parking for travelers you can find, and very very close to the center. We spent 30 hours (staying the night) and it cost us €21.50. The site is very clean and if you are lucky enough to park near the sea wall you will enjoy it a lot. Do not park in the driveway, ACs and vans congregate at the end of the parking lot. Safe and not noisy. To improve, the asphalt."
16197,2541788,4,AndyBurns1974,04/01/2023,"Yes it's simply a car park with no facilities.
however, it's a quiet spot with easy access to the old town and sunsets over the Atlantic and fortifications makes it a great car park to be based from. 


24 hour for our van was on 14€ great value and a great spot. we have a van not a motor home


parked up against the wall with the sound of waves as the back drop."
16197,2531657,4,robbog,28/12/2022,"Although it has no services, the site is fine. There is a flat area to park motorhomes at €14/day. At night it is very quiet, you only hear the sea.

16197,2520102,4,SarahT2,12/12/2022,Expensive but a great location to explore Cadiz. We did 1 night here and 1 night at the other car park near the docks which was €6.20 per 24hrs but noisy with the nightclub and shipping yard moving containers 24hrs. We expected to pay the €28 but were charged €14 and we’d stayed 23 hours. It is no more than a car park with rubbish bins but patrolled by staff and it feels friendly and secure.

16197,2504049,5,FredFlintsone,23/11/2022,We felt very comfortable & safe. Fall asleep to the sound of the sea & wake up again. Great setting when you are right by the sea. Short distances to the old town & nearby park.
16197,2488742,2,Yereimy,09/11/2022,"€14.80 per van less than 6m, without services, nothing can be taken out. For this price it is better to look for a campsite. There are many places to park without paying."
16197,2468073,5,AlvaroSanz,29/10/2022,"We were at the end of September. Highly recommended place to visit Cádiz since you are very close to the center. The parking lot is very quiet and has very clean bathrooms. To take a shower in the summer months, you just have to go to La Caleta beach, a 10-minute walk away, and for one euro you can shower in luxury."
16197,2425698,5,Exorsi,05/10/2022,I was dubious about paying €14\nt but sitting here looking out at the lapping waves it seems a bargain. 15mins to the centre of town. excellent and feels safe

You have to be careful when entering if you are in a motorhome since the entrance is not very wide, although you can still enter and exit easily. The location is fine, there is a beach 5 minutes away that, although it is not the most beautiful in Cádiz, is very good."

16197,2315976,3,Novatis,29/08/2022,"Very expensive for not having any service, although I would return for its location, near the center and that you sleep by the sea. In the previous car park you would be closer to the center but without spectacular views of the reefs and the fortress."

16197,2276551,5,karlillos12,21/08/2022,"Perfect for visiting Cádiz, everything very close at hand. It is not a campsite, it is a parking lot, so you do not have the comforts of a campsite, but because of the area and the proximity of things, it is perfect"
16197,2276067,5,JonathanSanme,20/08/2022,"We have been 2 days and super good. Close to the historic center, the beach and the Genovés park We repeat for sure... The good thing about Cádiz is that you can explore it on foot. Since it is a small but very complete city. The bad thing is that it does not have services, I hope that the city council in the future thinks about putting them. It would be luxurious."

16197,1707228,3,STEPPHENWOLF,09/12/2021,"Parking without services on uneven ground and no attraction. The only interest if you are lucky, would be to be in the front line to observe the sunset and the sea beating over the wall from the AC. Although this implies that all night the wind is beating against the AC. Excessive value for money, in the case of AC with a length greater than 6m. A short walk from the center."

16197,1701953,4,Herbstkind,02/12/2021,We stood here for one night in early November. This place is perfect for visiting Cadiz. The course is right by the sea and we got a great side seat on Saturday morning. The sunset was very impressive!

16197,1691995,2,SantonaCamper,18/11/2021,"Quiet and well located place. We arrived with a vehicle that measures 5.99m and they charge us a double rate because we carry bike racks, with which they consider that the vehicle measures more than 6m."
16197,1691254,5,hedwigr,17/11/2021,"Super place to stay overnight. Worth the money (28 euros, > 6m). Close to the center, safe, spacious pitches with a view of the sea and sunset"

16197,1682274,5,ggt,08/11/2021,"Secure parking, ideally placed for visiting Cadiz. 14.50e for 24h (6m) this is not exaggerated since the whole center is paying every day of the week (when you can park)."

16197,1669762,4,Elcoven,30/10/2021,"This was the only place we could find to park our motorhome during the day in Cadiz, after trying a couple of others. The charge is €0.04 per minute for mohos, charged on exit, timed by ANPR. It's a bit of a walk to the town, but manageable. We walked into the main square, the cathedral and out to the castle within 3 hours (cost €7)."
16197,1668669,5,MikiJova,30/10/2021,"It seems like a great option to visit Cádiz. Two steps from the Caleta and very close to the center, parking directly on the sea and with great views. At night only the sound of the waves is heard. The only downside that they do not have to empty so it forces you to move at a given moment."
16197,1659416,4,Sarper,24/10/2021,This is the cheapest option we found in Cadiz for a longer stay; there is plenty of room but camping is not allowed (not ideal for a rooftop tent). I definitely recommend it!
16197,1659141,5,odysea1996,24/10/2021,"€ 14 for 24 hours: totally worth it. Amazing ocean view, well located, seemed safe too. Perfect for a few nights in Cadiz"

You can't get anything out and the dog is always tied up (although pets are welcome). Positive: close to the center and wonderful views"

And if you arrive and there is room in the motorhome area, you have triumphed because it has unparalleled views. The only but is that every time you enter you have to go all the way around. € 14 for the whole night 6m van"

Were standing and spending the night from Saturday 2:00 p.m. to Sunday 12:00 p.m. directly at the wall facing the sea. € 14.40 was the final price. Our camper has a pop-up roof, which was not a problem. There was a corrugated iron house right at the entrance: the toilet with running water and soap. We would definitely recommend the Platt again!"
16197,1562471,5,Archelon5,09/09/2021,"To see Cadiz and all its remarkable trees, this well-kept and secure parking lot is the only alternative. In addition, the place is managed by a reintegration association. Very quiet night and evening walk along the seafront, to the left when leaving the car park. Today, you have to arrive before 11:00 a.m. or after 7:00 p.m. to be parked correctly in the place provided (but not reserved) for motorhomes."

16197,1452013,1,ilasku,13/08/2021,"Shameful. The only parking for motorhomes in Cádiz. In addition to being expensive, the parking staff allows cars to park in the authorized area for motorhomes. I ask them why they are allowed to park and they reply that they are orders from their superior. Result, more cars than motorhomes. Shameful!!!"

With that price you should have access in good conditions, there are motorcycles parked in the access that leave you xms of passage. 10 euros for a 4-hour visit to the city. Nothing recommended if you have a large motorhome"

Otherwise, unobstructed views, royal calm and effective guarding: employees perform continuous rounds, align parking and pick up garbage. Near the historic city and shops and restaurants. Fabulous fish market less than a quarter of an hour walk. Conclusion: expensive, where a star less, but if we love the seaside and postcard sunsets we find ourselves in the absence of alternative on Cadiz."

16197,187673,4,amizy,30/08/2017,Guarded parking. Great location to visit the seafront and the historic center of Cádiz. The fare can slow down but it is very difficult to park in Cádiz so parking is more than validated.

16199,3238846,5,guzmansantosm,30/08/2023,"Gray water discharge point, fulfills its function. It is located to the right of the street in front of the Carrefour parking lot. The signal is clear. Commentary August 2023"
16199,2776422,1,MiriVan8,22/05/2023,"It gives the impression that they regretted putting up a motorhome area... where there was a faucet and an area for emptying grays, they put up a space for the disabled, apart from putting a sign prohibiting parking motorhomes in the parking area... it What they left behind was a gray emptiness in the middle and middle of the road. They covered one of the signs in the area with bags. Judge for yourself"
16199,2297729,1,cris_pirina,25/08/2022,"Loading and unloading is very inconvenient, because there are usually parked cars in the designated space and the source is very poorly located.

It is difficult to maneuver avoiding putting a wheel into the pit. I was at night, without problems; By day, it should be borne in mind that the street is two-way and in an urban environment."
16199,840735,2,jorconde,28/06/2020,"Thank you for existing but I had no water, I opened the path and nothing. Not being able to clean the black emptying after finishing emptying is not at all hygienic."

16199,664871,2,Attycus,28/08/2019,It is not very pleasant to empty. The square is unique and when we arrived there were 2 cars occupying it. Any motorhome service is always appreciated but should be done with a bit of criteria.
16199,510914,2,fraphnc,10/06/2019,"Plate to lift for toilets but not for gray water, a grid is available on the road against the sidewalk. All this is not always pleasant for the passers-by.

16243,694699,4,padraigl,17/09/2019,"This is a large carpark with a very large grass/dirt/sandy area behind and in front of the promonade that motorhomes can park overlooking the estuary. It pretty level and we did not need to put up chocks as it suited our shower drain.
There are NO services only small bins around the park. The services are at Eroski supermarket 5 minutes up the road. There are water taps around the park but not sure if they are portable.

Cafe, restaurants and a lavanderia are facing the carpark. Public swimming pool, tennis courts, skate park and a dog training area are in the park.

The promonade goes around the estuary and is busy in the evenings with people walking, running and on their bikes.

Bugs/Mosquitoes. (They love us..)
We had 1 mosquito in the motorhome and it bit my wife through her clothes while I was walking on the promonade. We did eventually find it and send it to mosquitoe heaven. Thought we would have more due to the estuary but alas no."

This past summer we came one day and we could not park because they had reserved everything for a kind of flea market. Next bars, supermarkets, the center of town 3 minutes away ...

A car had to reverse half a kilometer to the headlight because we did not fit with the two vehicles. The one on the right has an impressive downward fall, with no remover or any type of barrier."

16258,3274812,2,noelia9889,09/09/2023,"Good location, next to the Carnota beach parking lot. But it can be quite improved. The signage is poor, the dirt road to access is full of potholes, there is only one tap (where we could only clean the toilet: none of our adapters fit), and the place to empty the toilet is not hygienic (hole under a metal plate on the floor). The Cee gas station is much better."
16258,3272708,5,chiquicrispis,08/09/2023,"Many thanks to the council for this service. It's great, you only need a large thread adapter for the hose, which comes in any adapter pack, ideal to have along with the hose.

16263,411662,4,arranlawson,03/12/2018,"3.5 stars. Good location, close to beach, free. Issue is on a road"
16271,3256421,3,journeyfromthemiddle,04/09/2023,Parking was quite full (arrived 5pm)with many vans that look permanent. It was not particularly clean and was smelly (maybe by people dumping grey water in the area).  It had bins. Despite a couple of late arrivals it was a quiet night.
16271,3232955,5,Domilos12,29/08/2023,"we stopped for one night, many campers to feel safe and a fantastic view of the sea when you wake up"
16271,3231005,1,merisu,28/08/2023,"This place is going from bad to worse. loud people until 5am, being a parking lot is what it is. You can't miss the smart one who showers with soap and leaves the whole puddle, that's how it goes. lots of fixed a/c. for one night, nothing more."
16271,3216223,3,Sabiri7,25/08/2023,"all quite dirty, many people and without respecting the hours of sleep. The place is very beautiful and easily accessible, but the beach is not usable. we spend the night to fish from the promenade. at 6 in the morning the civil guard came by with the car with a camera on the roof and they stopped one by one and took photos. I don't know if fining the one who had things outside or because they happened"
16271,3213618,4,simon3102,25/08/2023,Spent one night here. You feel safe because there are many campers. A little dirty
16271,3201075,5,estelagaaa,22/08/2023,"Very quiet place to spend the night, there are many ACs and it is close to the beach, 15 minutes from Malaga center, I would definitely repeat"
16271,3185071,5,juanpolo,20/08/2023,"We spent the night with no problem in AC. Great place facing the sea, one of the few and best places to stay overnight in Malaga city. Nice walk around."
16271,3105411,4,chozaneta,09/08/2023,"They have just put up a sign prohibiting the movement of vehicles over 5 meters. We have spent the night without problem, but the signal is already there. Although it is still full of AC and people staying overnight"
16271,3086410,3,SandroT,06/08/2023,Nice atmosphere came in the evening and was already very crowded as there were a lot of local campers fishing there…
16271,3082816,5,Mml095,05/08/2023,"We really liked this place, it has spectacular views, it is next to the coastal path, a 3-minute walk from the beach which has a shower and an area for barbecues with tables at the top. In the parking lot there were quite a few vans, caravans and motorhomes. We stayed two nights and we loved it."
16271,3078206,3,D.Ptn,04/08/2023,"It is a good place for people who like to be in a lot of company (type in a campsite). Access to the beach is very, very difficult as it is littered with large rocks. There are a lot of parking spaces, but when I came there was hardly a place since it was summer and there are many people staying for a long time as other comments say. There is a good path for cycling and walking."
16271,3074100,5,ducatav,04/08/2023,"A site where several ACs camp, someone who lives here. Facing the sea, ideal for a walk along the promenade enabled. Good camper atmosphere. A little noisy at night due to the movement of cars, and people who go to sleep later. But nothing out of the ordinary. I would come back here."
16271,3052985,5,GuidaJunglist,31/07/2023,"we spend two nights here and it was the best place for us.
I'm looking for the guy that was there this week , he tooked us a photo on the sunset, tattooed arms. if anyone know him please let me know"
16271,3029506,3,aymericblt,27/07/2023,Good location clean from the beach…parking a little dirty…reassuring because several motorhomes…on the other hand a little noisy all night people come and go…the impression that some live here all year round…can not find better
16271,2988838,4,anetagrs,19/07/2023,"We were very comfortable, we spent a quiet night, there are a few motorhomes that live there and they are very friendly. The next day we went down to Playa del Cuervo, a 5-minute walk away, it has a shower to remove the sand, on this same beach there is another parking lot but they usually have barbecues and there is more fuss."
16271,2918903,5,Pinuccio2023,03/07/2023,Very nice and shaded parking. We spent only one night here and despite the proximity to the road we slept soundly…fresh and peaceful. The place is isolated but there are many campers. A path to the sea also passes through it but we didn't do it. Handsome!
16271,2892989,2,FortySeven,26/06/2023,"It is not a recommended place, at least in summer. Very close to the road, very crowded even at 03.00 am. Very crowded with big AC in the morning. It's hard to get a seat. At dawn many people come with noisy cars. There are bins. There is a lot of shade. The beach and the showers are about 300m away"
16271,2846676,5,AoifeRedmond,12/06/2023,"Great spot. There are no services, but lots of shade and right next to a board walk that brings you to multiple different beaches. Shops nearby. It can be pretty busy though."
16271,2839100,5,espeyreinazafis,10/06/2023,"We spent only one night here, it was quite quiet, very close to the road but no noise was heard. There were more vans and AC. It has a small promenade where you can go for a walk."
16271,2829524,5,VictoriaGamero,07/06/2023,"I loved the place, we were able to sleep without problems and without noise. The views are beautiful, although you have to walk a bit to go down to the beach. One of my favorite places in the area to spend the night"
16271,2821685,2,SaskiaCarolin,05/06/2023,"We didn't like it at all, it's right on a freeway, totally noisy, no beach, lots of campers parking like anything else.."
16271,2812962,5,rutaruperta,02/06/2023,A very beautiful place. 1-2 min walk to the beach! About 40 places for campers.
16271,2791805,4,Julio7763,27/05/2023,Busy little spot so come early.No water or waste facilities but does have bins that are regularly emptied.Right next to the sea where you can sit and enjoy a beer.We felt safe to park up here for the night.As mentioned before there is a bit of road noise so earplugs are a must !Great for a stopover.
16271,2756647,3,LaGriotte,17/05/2023,"I put 3 * because not so bad for Málaga. Beach next door. So a little less urban than the other options in town. We hear the road and camping atmosphere without the amenities. Lots of CCs, families etc, with aperitif noise until 1am. (We were there on May 11)"
16271,2734676,2,Kikab,08/05/2023,"There is no directly accessible beach, just rocks. This location may possibly be interesting for a fisherman but, a priori, there are not many fish in the area! In addition, it is located below a fairly busy road."
16271,2712150,5,zaZUKowani,01/05/2023,"We recomend this parking. 2 min to beach. Quite during the night, just noise from road above."
16271,2711216,5,PilyVaro,30/04/2023,"Good views, large garbage cans... a lot of people, yes, you have to go early to take a seat! Everyone with Camper or caravans, silence was very respected, and we slept luxuriously. Very good to enjoy the beaches of Malaga, the fish and the surrounding mountains"
16271,2703448,4,amelievdh,28/04/2023,"Slept there one night, parking lot quite full. We hear the traffic. Just a trash can. At the seaside..."
16271,2659342,4,Anaye,10/04/2023,"We spent a quiet night, without noise, although quite tight as it was full and by chance we caught a place. Good sunrise and good views"
16271,2652872,4,EllenFee,09/04/2023,"Great free parking but very busy and with know-it-all permanent campers. Relatively clean. The police would probably check and hand out fines for soap/shower gel from time to time, but overnight stays would be allowed. Big street barely audible. Great connection to Málaga from El Palo, there are also beautiful beaches, restaurants and supermarkets, about 10-20 minutes west along the beach."
16271,2650472,4,Travel4life16,08/04/2023,Very full. Large mobile homes don't stand a chance. Free space is a matter of luck. Better in the morning. Otherwise one of the few free parking spaces around Málaga...
16271,2635408,2,Km900000,02/04/2023,"full, and the end of March."
16271,2635342,3,gerrypfn,02/04/2023,Ok for one night. Bit crowded but we managed to get our 8.5m van in. Short walk to the beach or bars. Felt Safe enough. Bit of road noise but nothing some earplugs couldn’t block.
16271,2627224,3,Mitu,27/03/2023,"I don't know why the place has such good reviews. I have nothing against standing close together, but you do feel constricted here. The area isn't the prettiest either. For me only one night and it's good for that, but I don't quite understand why you would want to stay here longer."
16271,2623391,4,milis237,25/03/2023,"Arrived around 3:00 p.m. and got hold of the last place for the time being. It is also used as a normal parking lot, so there is a relatively high fluctuation and cars that arrive later are also lucky. We loved the place. There were large garbage cans everywhere and a wonderful view."
16271,2620549,2,Alt-Family,23/03/2023,"Parking not suitable for vehicles over 8 meters. I don't understand what makes it so attractive. Approximately 8km from Malaga, without services, you are attached to each other and if you are lucky you can even hear the neighbor snoring. We will not be returning and I do not recommend it."
16271,2617076,4,steven1909,20/03/2023,"A super place with many parking spaces. The road is noisy, but that makes up for the security that comes with parking with 20-30 other campers and cars. In addition, the view is great and the dog beach and restaurants are within walking distance."
16271,2613088,5,viveloscolores,17/03/2023,"The site itself is very good to spend the day and night. Although it is very crowded and it is difficult to park, this makes it lose some of its charm. Otherwise great views."
16271,2601010,1,NiFrie,06/03/2023,"Rarely seen anything like this! Here, no consideration is given to each other and the whole square is blocked by parked cars. Above all, the ""campers"" with their giant ships do what they want here. They are not interested in the fact that there could be 2-3 ""normal"" buses or cars instead of a ship. Just ignorant. The place should urgently be cleared again by the police!"
16271,2600130,1,Lauritawar,05/03/2023,"It is very crowded and everyone parks as they please, so the space is not used as it should be. Some move their cars from the front row, put some chairs to save their place and leave. There are some that are established, so although it is a worthwhile site, I do not think it will have much left, since we do not take care of it."
16271,2595317,2,Park53,01/03/2023,Good location for visiting Malaga. But crowded on this first day of March. A little roots but hey ...... for one night it's fine. Too bad the town doesn't do anything better.
16271,2594716,2,mamelix,01/03/2023,"Good for visiting Malaga, crowded and pee smelling around."
16271,2590970,3,u3900256,25/02/2023,"If you are self-sufficient, a nice place. We stayed here for one night. Dusk on the bench by the sea. No service except rubbish."
16271,2588409,1,jcguerreroes,23/02/2023,"This site is overcrowded as of February 23, 2023. There is not a single place to park, all full of motorhomes at will. Incredible…."
16271,2584392,4,Damian1991,20/02/2023,Amazing place we have found many places certainly not facing the sea but that's okay no service and people who have been here for a long time and unload on the ground. One night is certainly worth it
16271,2578920,1,Springer12,15/02/2023,"Out of curiosity I drove past the square. It's full and everyone's confused. Whoever thinks it doesn't matter how and where the main thing is that it doesn't cost anything. Where do you leave your gray water and cassette contents, probably not all have a separate toilet. Observed how a camper with 2 cans to fetch water were on the way, unfortunately the showers are locked in 300 meters :-)."
16271,2578375,4,cogito,15/02/2023,"Long-term parkers: true very popular, since free of charge: true, hardly any free spaces: true f/m/d: standing in close contact with garbage cans, nothing else Location: very good"
16271,2566475,1,kakraemer,02/02/2023,"catastrophe! The place is totally parked with mobile homes of all sizes. We hardly got back down, the wagons are so close together."
16271,2565805,4,Jeselyn,01/02/2023,"A place with several places to park, but it was very busy, we arrived at 11 pm and we barely got a free space, if they find a place it is ideal. A very quiet night is spent, it is worth staying here, the beach is in front and you can walk and see the landscape. There are cans to throw the garbage."
16271,2563988,1,Lman,30/01/2023,What used to be one our favourite spots is now rammed full with long term vans. Many parked inconsiderately. Some look like short stay so may move but no room today.
16271,2563823,1,emax88,29/01/2023,"Parking lot full of permanent residents, we struggled to find a place ... and regretted it. Generators on until late, sewage discharges at night so as not to be seen (4 o'clock) but it felt great! All 'set up' outside like a campsite. Thanks to all these behaviors it will definitely be closed soon!"
16271,2561725,1,Beckydawson,27/01/2023,completely full with long-term motorhomes
16271,2561279,3,Malikcop,26/01/2023,"No services. Far from the city center. Nice view of the sea, bins emptied every day, close to the seafront and restaurants, quite quiet."
16271,2555427,2,ArminStahl,19/01/2023,"We arrived here around 12 p.m. and just managed to get hold of a spot. It'll be fine for one night. As in many places, there are a lot of long-term parkers here."
16271,2554496,3,Irie,18/01/2023,"Crowded gets a new meaning here, every meter is taken and people seem not to mind blocking cars or paths. However movements every day so you might take a chance. On the Sentero to Malaga. Nice bikeride into town. Calm nights."
16271,2550112,4,KonDeer,12/01/2023,Crowded but safe and nice place right next to the beach. Malaga center is 7-8 km from here. Its biggest disadvantage is the lack of services.
16271,2550103,1,Carl407H,12/01/2023,Catastrophe! Packed to the brim with no regard for locals or other visitors. The thick camper vans stand close to each other here.
16271,2547677,3,HymerHans,09/01/2023,"Noisy, small parkup next to the coast. Spent two nights without any problem."
16271,2542993,2,danytogno,05/01/2023,I stopped by seeing the various positive reviews but it is very close to the main road so you can hear the cars a lot. I found much better parking!
16271,2541210,4,Hailee,04/01/2023,"Full to the burst. But not dirty at all. It is a very popular spot.
Still a nice location. Maybe one of the best around..."
16271,2538827,1,PowByte,02/01/2023,Full to burst. To many trees and dirty.
16271,2534721,5,InaIgnac,30/12/2022,Nice but full. Just full. We didn't get a seat
16271,2534108,4,marifelixova,30/12/2022,"Full of motorhomes and vans, we arrived at night and found one last spot. No privacy, road right behind the parking (lights from the road a bit disturbing). Very nice walks around with the dog, close to the promenade. Public free toilets near 5 mins walk). 1 night ok."
16271,2533700,5,GiuliaPanna,30/12/2022,"We are spending a few days here ... magical landscape, bathrooms 5min walk on the path, close to the beach, bus stop for Malaga center 5min walk. shops reachable on foot or by bike, along the path and the seafront"
16271,2528326,5,PeteNui,26/12/2022,"Very best spot we have so far. we are spending Christmas eve and Christmas day here. really love this place. quiet, clean and safe."
16271,2526233,4,RafaHDnomada,22/12/2022,"A good place close to the city. It would be good if we made an effort to keep it well, for when you come back or new Campers arrive."
16271,2520901,3,Cruizer76,13/12/2022,Totally full. Even in continuous rain. The only nice thing here is the proximity to the sea.
16271,2519705,3,Blaidelta,11/12/2022,I have slept one night. The noise of the highway is heard. The site is secure. It looked like a camp to me. As a storm threatened I did not see it for sure
16271,2510180,4,Rubenoestergaard,01/12/2022,"Ok for visiting Malaga. But A LOT of campers and a very busy road next to the site. I would go somewhere more quiet, but we are also sleeping in the pop up roof."
16271,2508821,4,colaurado,29/11/2022,ideal for motorhome. easy access. beautiful view of the sea. benches and garbage cans.
16271,2504902,4,RichardSaenz,25/11/2022,"It is not a regulated car park as such and it is overcrowded. It is not close to go to Malaga on foot, you need a bike or motorcycle. The good thing are the views, the promenade and a beach next door. There is space for all types of vehicles. A little noise from vehicles because the road is nearby but you sleep super safe."
16271,2504147,2,JensJacob,24/11/2022,"Don't be fooled by the photos. Advantage: relatively close to Malaga, good network. The place is completely overcrowded. After 3 p.m. there is almost no gap, but everyone tries to stay up late at night. The feeder road is busy until 11 p.m. Many permanent campers in cars. Dusty and cramped. Malaga should offer more and regulate more strictly. My opinion."
16271,2503426,4,TirzavdB,23/11/2022,great place near the bus stop to the city. we slept peacefully even though it was a busy affair.
16271,2500477,5,Eladudek,19/11/2022,Very nice parking. Lots of campers. Safe to Malaga 6 km.
16271,2498405,5,Eurotraveller2022,17/11/2022,Super cool atmosphere!
16271,2494384,2,LotharMeyer,13/11/2022,"The place is perfect for cycling to Malaga. We spent 2 nights here at the weekend. There were many Spanish campers here, so we felt relatively safe. Thank you Spain for such places."
16271,2484575,2,LuKyHan,06/11/2022,"On the weekend, the place is literally crammed with motorhomes. Access to the sea problematic. We used the place as a starting point for a cycling trip to Malaga."
16271,2462729,5,andreapinchi,26/10/2022,"The car park is nice, popular and overlooking the sea. Right next to it passes a pedestrian and cycle path that goes towards Malaga and leads to nearby beaches. One in particular (playa del penon del cuervo) is very nice, large and with free bathrooms, just a pity that the beach showers didn't work"
16271,2447583,3,TomasP,16/10/2022,"Ok place to park, showers were not working (only the ones closer to center)
At night a lot of noise from the main road (so not much sleep)

Located 15min from center by bike"
16271,2443639,3,cecilep74,14/10/2022,The spot is very nice but there are way too many people. The sunrise was very beautiful.
16271,2443463,5,Tini2012,14/10/2022,We stayed here for one night in October. The place was well attended with many campers. Great location. although the square is below the main road it wasn't noisy at night. In the high season you might have trouble getting a place here.
16271,2435173,5,irenegoco,10/10/2022,"Park with spectacular views! Near Malaga with a brutal promenade. The problem is that there are many motorhomes, and it is difficult to find a place."
16271,2429844,4,annaubdfloundbob,07/10/2022,"Nice place. However, the bushes around it are very littered and characterized by going to the toilet ... we found the street very groaning from the noise level."
16271,2425923,5,MartinaComai,05/10/2022,nice and quiet parking
16271,2416513,3,sterchi,01/10/2022,"There are campers who have been standing here for a long time and dispose of their gray water in the bushes. I don't even want to know where they're going with the Blackwater. The view of the sea is wonderful, the beach with a working beach shower is not far. The place is right on a street and still quiet at night. No toilets available. Unsuitable for vehicles without their own toilet."
16271,2412466,5,Hugislive,29/09/2022,Awesome parking lot. Clean as the garbage truck comes twice a day. without service you get a fantastic view of the sea here! Street noise very low. gladly again!!!!!! Very close to Malaga city
16271,2406612,5,Trafas,27/09/2022,"Very quiet place, full of neighbors. Safe and with great sea views. Best to sleep."
16271,2396963,3,galikanokus,23/09/2022,"Nice place to stay overnight. Came there around midnight and there was still lots of free spaces. I feelt safe there. Bit noisy from time to time, but can’t complain, as what to expect when you park next to busy road. In a morning I meet some friendly people, definitely advise this place as morning view cure all of the minuses related to night sounds"
16271,2396327,4,anarcotico,23/09/2022,Beach showers nearby and barbecues with tables. Tiny beach. Near Cala del Moral.
16271,2387875,3,zoerik,20/09/2022,"ok for one night. street is not as loud as you think (but you can hear it) - unfortunately it is very dirty. It is also not very suitable for swimming (but we made it easy anyway). rather a place for the ""emergency"" ..."
16271,2387126,5,AdamKolarik,19/09/2022,Very nice place with view of the sea. It was super crowded though and some noice was coming from the near road. Stayed 2 nights and enjoyed a lot.
16271,2369310,4,Elios59T,14/09/2022,"Beautiful location near the Nautical Club (pleasant little beach access) and the El Dedo district (restaurants and bars) Very crowded on weekends and public holidays, especially when some CCs settle permanently facing the sea instead of parking in cob as befits free public parking. Very quiet night despite some occasional noisy passages on the main road quite close"
16271,2346848,5,ViR.22.9,06/09/2022,quiet place to spend the night
16271,2314038,5,JorgeFigueiredo,28/08/2022,Fantastic place to sleep one night. If possible arrive in time to see the sunset. no services
16271,2307074,5,LaTrokaDaily,27/08/2022,"The parking lot would be much cleaner if those who come by car did not relieve themselves in the bushes and around the shameless, otherwise it is not quiet because it is between a road with a lot of car traffic and a road that connects beaches through which many people walk but good for one or two nights passing through is not bad."
16271,2289840,4,Aluvan,23/08/2022,"Good free pitch right by the sea. Spent 2 nights there. There were many other campers there. Unfortunately, the adjacent street was very noisy."
16271,2285466,5,superchic975,22/08/2022,"I'm August, plenty of parking and bigger spaces for Small RVs and camper vans.  Absolutely beautiful location!"
16271,2280539,5,valentina1990,21/08/2022,"Rest area without services and free, a few meters from the sandy beach. Showers and toilets are possible on the beach. Great panorama both in the evening and in the morning. We stayed for one night in total tranquility and safety."
16271,2261600,5,eyzulay,18/08/2022,"For me the best place to spend the day and spend the night. There is shade and sea views. Plenty of room for big ACs, mine is 7.60 and no hassles. Very quiet place. You can hear the cars go by but at night almost nothing."
16271,2228875,3,merisu,13/08/2022,"Night of 12/8, civil guard at the entrance, it was packed for the Malaga fair. motorhomes with awnings and tables taking up space for three. Better to come on other dates."
16271,2213641,4,paulaundsamiontour,11/08/2022,"Great pitch, right on the stone beach. Well filled place so we felt safe, almost everyone had their chairs and tables outside."
16271,2212400,1,yorker,10/08/2022,"It looks like a town. It is full of vans, caravans and motorhomes. There were a few that were seen to be installed there. The police were fining some who had the awning removed. Other motorhomes occupying two sites. We were three years ago and it has nothing to do with what it was. We don't stay to sleep"
16271,2207846,5,Mamen8,10/08/2022,"Perfect parking overlooking the beach. Very quiet and comfortable. Clean, parceled out, with trees that provide shade and a small promenade with sea views."
16271,2198984,5,Caceres,08/08/2022,"Perfect place to park the motorhome and visit Malaga bus stop 200mtr away we spent one night and everything was perfect, keep the place clean to keep it that way"
16271,2187688,4,Anagd,06/08/2022,"A lot of shade, it is full of motorhomes and vans, with views of the sea, to sleep a little noise from cars since the road is close, but otherwise fine, walking 10 minutes there is a beach with showers and beach bars, during the day too cars park to go to the beach, there are free places to sleep"
16271,2178350,3,AcExtrellas,05/08/2022,"Good place to spend a night, lots of cars and fires in high season. It's spacious and has good views. People pull out chairs and tables and don't say anything. It has some shade but it is somewhat dirty. We have to be responsible"
16271,2122356,5,npio,25/07/2022,"Quiet place and good atmosphere, people take out chairs and tables and the police pass by but don't say anything. There is a pebble beach right there and a sandy beach 10 minutes away on foot."
16271,2109724,5,Dreameraventure,23/07/2022,"I was going to spend one night and finally I stayed 3! It is difficult to find an area in Malaga and this place has been perfect! Depending on the days there will be more caravans and the day the parking lot will be full of cars. Close to the beach, port, jogging,…"
16271,2090569,4,Jardin8282,18/07/2022,"The site is very nice, the location is great close to the city but outside of it. Nice visits and a nearby beach with showers and barbecues. The negative is that the road is very close although it lets you sleep. The Youth goes there to their things. A lot of movement of cars all day and night. When I went there were ACs who were not assiduous people in this world because they did not respect sleeping hours"
16271,2071016,4,titovirutad,14/07/2022,"Great site, beach with shower 5 min walk, town el palo 15 min walk we spent 3 nights and very quiet with shadows recommended 100x100 at 500 meters motorhome area to empty and fill."
16271,2065068,1,emmaandmichael,12/07/2022,"Be careful here! We were asked to pay for parking even though it should be free. It was also extremely busy and getting a spot was a challenge. Didn’t stay the night, just parked for the day."
16271,2063989,5,momo99,12/07/2022,"Great pitch for the night. We arrived around 9:30 p.m. and still managed to get a seat. When we arrived, the police were there because a camper had set everything up. Overnight stays are tolerated, but camping is not permitted."
16271,2058929,5,renault22,10/07/2022,"Very nice view, easy access to Malaga, we'll be back!"
16271,2020653,5,FrancescoN.,29/06/2022,"Perfect, directly on the cliff, a stone's throw from the beach and 5 minutes from the village. No loading / unloading. Very popular."
16271,2018888,5,babbnr,28/06/2022,"Best overnight parking we've had on the whole coast from Valencia. Quiet, frequented by many other vans/CCs and yet there was room in the evening for newcomers. The beach is nearby, there are cold showers there."
16271,1994333,4,espeyreinazafis,20/06/2022,"Parking next to the beach, very easy access from the road, with trees that provide shade (if you spend the day it is important). We only slept one night and we had no problem, there are plenty of parking lots. You can hear the sea in the background and the road if a noisy vehicle passes by, but not much. There are several garbage cans. The truth is that to be improvised it was quite good."
16271,1943653,5,danair,03/06/2022,"Great place right by the sea! We had a lot of visitors, probably 15 vehicles. Good night. You can hear the expressway, but it didn't bother us at night. A beautiful bathing bay with beach showers is 2 minutes to the east. The bus stop to Malaga center is 5 minutes walk away at the marina. Unfortunately a lot of toilet paper and legacies in the bushes. Trash cans available, please keep them clean!"
16271,1943016,4,laufame,03/06/2022,"Very nice parking place for vans and MHs. Beautiful view of the sea and nice walk on promenade. Would not stay for night, it’s a little dirty and noisy around here."
16271,1941576,4,JaviSaguSer,03/06/2022,It is very good especially to go by bike to Malaga. We must be clean and careful and not give the image of a wild camp so that they let us continue enjoying the place.
16271,1939031,5,floramei,02/06/2022,"Divine view for sunset, spend the night without problem. Divine, clean. no services"
16271,1938082,4,ArthurColson,01/06/2022,Small pleasant car park facing the sea and close to Malaga (the city is easily accessible by bike). Only downside: overcrowded parking lot :(
16271,1915024,4,Aloys52686,25/05/2022,It is incomprehensible that this place is so poorly known. 10 minute walk to El Palo. 8 km to Málaga. Spacious place and directly on the sea. Beautiful ! Let's keep it that way. No amenities. At 7 pm the police arrived and the seats had to be cleared.
16271,1896647,2,Ericmk1,17/05/2022,"Very nice place. However, we did not feel safe and drove again. Strange men were very interested in our car. Another shouted very aggressively and hit a tree with a machete as he tried to build a shower. They'll be gone in 2 weeks, they screamed when we asked. PS no gorillas"
16271,1878330,4,buttermacfly,08/05/2022,"We got a miracle site. The people are very friendly, but many live there, they spread out everything, they make fires, they talk until dawn. beach. we have gone by bike to malaga and great because there is a bike lane almost all the way. it seems like a free campsite lol. There are containers and shower on the beach."
16271,1870302,3,Laumofe,04/05/2022,"We arrived very late and found a place just below the road, if you wake up with little sleep you will be regular, but the location and the views are very cool. It looks like people stay there forever..."
16271,1870203,3,Travelaar,04/05/2022,"Super busy, completely full at the end of April. No services, which is fine, but because it is so busy, there is no or hardly any sea view."
16271,1858906,4,ohanas,29/04/2022,We stood 1 night. It was really okay for that. Almost crowded. were lucky. Great boardwalk. The street noise didn't bother us. It was quiet at night. Would come again.
16271,1858299,4,rakelabril,28/04/2022,Wide and level but quite crowded being low season
16271,1839128,3,ALIFEINHOLIDAY,19/04/2022,Nice parking on the seafront. Crowded on weekends and popular holiday periods. also very quiet car park you hear some street traffic recommended and a bit far from the center of Malaga.
16271,1839105,4,AdrianCastells,19/04/2022,"A full of campers and AC, in front of the beach and 10 minutes from the promenade of Malaga with many restaurants, everyone respects your space, good location."
16271,1832358,3,Lastola,17/04/2022,"A good place to spend the night, near Malaga and with beautiful walks along the coast. The bad, many people and quite dirty."
16271,1830168,4,thevivavan,17/04/2022,Parking very good but crowded.
16271,1828360,3,PelicansVoladors,16/04/2022,"Mixed parking, next to the N340"
16271,1824538,4,Mariazg,15/04/2022,Good place to spend the night! Lots of motorhomes and campers. In the morning the local police have come but they have not said anything.
16271,1822152,4,reisefreak1,14/04/2022,"A very nicely located, free space, which is mainly used by motorhomes of all sizes. Magnificent views of the sea and the Bay of Málaga. The road behind it doesn't bother us, especially since there is hardly any traffic at night. Very easy to cycle to Málaga, about 8 km; many resto's along the promenade. Only rubbish bins, otherwise no possibility of supply."
16271,1818722,4,najamafe,13/04/2022,We have been two great nights. We do not give it 5 stars because it is far from the center. The area is quiet next to the beach with the promenade that connects to the center in 20 minutes by bike.
16271,1815273,5,Kikidou309,11/04/2022,"Good and safe place, conform to the description !

>>> keep your trash, take care of environment, leave no trace  <<<"
16271,1812830,2,DisgraceNo1,10/04/2022,"Some inconsiderate long-term campers, so the place is often full. The main thing is that the birdcage and the scooter have space. There was excrement and toilet paper everywhere in the bushes. Garbage is partly disposed of in the bushes, despite the trash cans. Sewage just runs out. Atmosphere of the permanent campers rather gloomy and arrogant. Locals pissed off by the behavior! Sadly, the place would be really really nice, surely banned soon."
16271,1810310,4,Gulliverkli,08/04/2022,"Safe, not far from the historical city centre. We spent here 2 nights without any problem."
16271,1808521,4,RamS.,06/04/2022,"We stayed for one night, were passing through. Perfect place for one night, also for more. Many use it for a trip to Malaga (bus stop at the gas station ahead). Also a few permanent campers who leave everything outside and the place looks a bit messy. But all in all GREAT!"
16271,1804911,5,Klunkertusse,03/04/2022,We stood here for a few nights with a sea view. A cool place to explore Malaga by bike or bus.
16271,1796930,4,Alcacp,27/03/2022,"We have been from Saturday to Sunday, ample parking on the beachfront. We have spent the night without problem, although we have deployed nothing outside, other neighbors had a table and chairs outside. Definitely a hit place."
16271,1782921,4,PapySunny,14/03/2022,Very good location 7km from Malaga (ideal by bike). We arrived on a Friday evening and there were a few places left. Armored on weekends with motorhomes + locals (and unfortunately very dirty)
16271,1781187,3,mabilica,12/03/2022,"Very convenient, on the main road and just outside Malaga, right on the coast.  You can also visit La Cala & El Palo. Both have some lovely shops and cafes. Spaces for most of the day in March."
16271,1777594,5,pompon17,08/03/2022,"A stop to schedule in the morning because very popular place. Parking where you can spend 1 or more nights, without services. But the view and the location are great. A seafront promenade, cycle path, beach. We think that in high and mid season, places must be inaccessible..."
16271,1772776,5,marmelleo,04/03/2022,"Beautiful parking, no service but quiet right on the sea and on a very long promenade. Highly recommended and not too far from Malaga city."
16271,1770530,5,Atchy,01/03/2022,Great place to stay. Very flat and with the bike you are very mobile in the vicinity. Space is now packed at the beginning of March 2022.
16271,1769030,4,hdavis248,28/02/2022,"Nice little car park next to the beach with some lovely walks. True you are packed in like sardines but it's fine for one or two nights. Before we left, some inconsiderate landships with trailers took up about 4 spaces each so you may find the place full but only with a small number of vehicles!!"
16271,1764768,1,DominicRuehl,24/02/2022,"Unfortunately, I can only agree with many of the previous speakers. You stand close together and a few very nice colleagues block the first line, several places for themselves."
16271,1762716,4,EGPH,22/02/2022,We stayed here for a few days and had a good time. We found many campers but made friends with the neighbors. The noise from the street above can be heard but it is not too annoying and then the beach is very close and sunrise and sunset are spectacular!
16271,1762514,5,4Vanderlust,21/02/2022,"02/17: Arrived at the beginning of the afternoon there was still a place for us, it is true that it is not easy because the car park is small and there are a lot of campers + local cars. The place is beautiful with the promenade and a beach not far away."
16271,1757038,4,JocJacCampingcar,15/02/2022,"small car park well located facing the sea, difficult to find a place."
16271,1753742,4,Valto31,12/02/2022,We arrived in the afternoon at 2 motorhomes of 8 meters and we found 2 places indeed some we need 3 places but that's everywhere. We spent 2 nice days in a quiet place
16271,1751470,1,Gerd247,09/02/2022,"Very nice place, but unfortunately everything is too parked, I suspect, as it is with long-term parkers. We had to keep going, and so did everyone else after us. Some are across which they claim 3 places for themselves, well birdcage and drying rack need space too."
16271,1747099,5,Vagabond-on-tour,04/02/2022,"The 160 or 163 bus, starting at the petrol station, takes you to the center in 18 minutes for €1.55."
16271,1744095,5,goldinesatack,30/01/2022,"The site is very comfortable, quite quiet and you feel safe. Incredible sea views and beautiful walking path. Very close to Malaga and easily accessible. The only problem is that it is usually very crowded and it is difficult to find a place."
16271,1740415,3,lucaspanu,24/01/2022,"like many others I find myself writing that the place is fantastic but many people with the camper just don't know how to live ... they take more seats and even go away and leave chairs and bikes to stop the parking ... crazy stuff ... if then there are perimeter bars and prohibitions, ask yourself two questions ... do not privatize the spaces ..."
16271,1739801,1,parkvw5,23/01/2022,"It's a very nice pitch, but how impudent some campers are taking the 3 parking spaces for themselves. Also for the residents here in the area. And then the people wonder why there are prohibition signs. Not recommended at all we drove on"
16271,1738699,4,Nila_Chinchilla,22/01/2022,"Parking itself is very nice, close to small beaches and restaurants. Only downer is that it's super crowded (also in off season) and the space could fit way more cars and Vans when people would park  their big as caravans not as selfish. PLEASE ALWAYS REMEMBER OTHER PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A GOOD EXPERIENCE TOO AND NOT JUST YOURSELF."
16271,1735597,5,Jaromg,17/01/2022,"Great. We arrived at 9:00 p.m. and there were only 3 spaces left. You are at the foot of the sea and close to the sandy beach. A few meters away there is a walk, in the morning there are people walking and cycling, who do not bother us at all. The highway is nearby, you can hear the cars go by at night. But for me, seeing the comfort of being with 20 other ACs, by the sea… it is priceless. It gave me a lot of security. It has no service."
16271,1733015,4,Chcol89,13/01/2022,"If you arrive and there is room, it's happiness, very well located by the sea, beautiful walk with nearby shops at 1/4 hour. Some stay there"
16271,1727921,5,Vanlifestarters,06/01/2022,"quiet,very nice,but quite crowded beginning od January.Good place to visit Malaga,cycling paths"
16271,1720436,5,RatayTeam,30/12/2021,"Spent a few nights. Good vibes and friendly campers. Yes, it's crowded - it's also safe, free, level, and near the water. our dog enjoyed playing with other dogs."
16271,1719460,4,NilsB1979,30/12/2021,Good free space. Road audible towards morning. Quite full. There is a beautiful beach in 500m. To the center of Malaga approx. 5km along the water.
16271,1715101,3,fammol,24/12/2021,"This parking lot has been completely taken over by motorhomes. Two years ago we were there for two nights with only 4 campers, I wonder how long this place will remain legal to spend the night. Every now and then some people drive around in cars with music. Otherwise great place."
16271,1714856,3,DeNiiiiiice,23/12/2021,"The place right by the sea, we hardly heard the street. Great starting point for cycling towards the center of Malaga. The place was full at night. We stood here one night. The city designed the area around the parking lot really well. It's just a shame that apparently every bush and corner around it is used to do its toilet."
16271,1714268,5,riffian,22/12/2021,Good place by the sea. With the bike you have all options. You can hear the road something else all good. Water and disposal can be found at the parking space one kilometer further.
16271,1712419,4,elrocio,19/12/2021,"don't come too late! it's quickly full 7 km from Malaga, cycle path, illuminations to see !!"
16271,1711286,4,pepitatravel,17/12/2021,"Very good spot facing the sea. Lots of people but to spend the night is very good and at this time of year we do not hear too much the road. On the other hand, watch out for the big pigs which empty their gray water in the parking lot. A shame !"
16271,1710564,4,maloox89,15/12/2021,"Good place to spend one or two nights obviously no privacy (don't understand what people want more than being free and no police kicking you away!).
Lots of noise from the road but great seafront position.
So bad to see some big 200.000€ or something motor home just leaving their grey waters on the ground.
Please"
16271,1705564,1,park4night145,07/12/2021,"Packed with campers now.. Cant stay here, no privacy."
16271,1703813,4,playaluz,05/12/2021,"The site is fine, 10 minutes walk from many restaurants and bus to Malaga. On the bridge of the Immaculate is full. The caravans have been respectful and quiet, although the traffic on the road above can be heard quite a bit."
16271,1703105,5,Protrust,04/12/2021,Great place right by the sea and packed with mobile homes every day or evening. We stood there for 2 nights without any problems and went into town on a Vespa. Also goes very well along the beach with a bike.
16271,1702421,5,cocoaroundtheworld,03/12/2021,"incredible place. in front of the beach, of season no police checken so you can stay for as long as you want!"
16271,1698890,2,Zora777,27/11/2021,In November totally overcrowded with camper vans.
16271,1697704,5,adam12813,25/11/2021,Excellent parking for overnight stay. Can access the sea too. Flat promenade for walking/running which was great. Would recommend.
16271,1689292,5,Chapuis,14/11/2021,5 stars for the view and the location close to the cycle path that leads in 30 minutes by bike to the center of Malaga. Magnificent sunset and sunrise. Breathtaking view for the squares along the sea. Proximity to the road. We actually hear the 4-way close. You won't be alone. Lots of CC. There were just 3 places left at 7 p.m. in mid November.
16271,1687019,5,VanLiz,13/11/2021,"You feel like you're at the campsite; o) Of course you can hear the N-340 well, but on the whole it's quiet at night. If you really want to have peace and quiet, it is best to go to the prairie. beautiful location, close to the city and right on the sea. What more do you want (sea)"
16271,1685938,4,patetmarie,12/11/2021,"Very nice place by the sea accessible to large motorhomes, very quiet night. Sad to see some emptying their gray water on the spot, three vans around us! Is it so difficult to respect the places available to us?"
16271,1674573,5,frannetpat,02/11/2021,Full sea view. Many c.car. For me very well.
16271,1672812,4,chark7,01/11/2021,Good location and close to the coast with a coastal walk. In the mornings there are people walking or doing sports. Quiet night (always depends on the neighbors on wheels) Suitable for dogs. All Saints Bridge quite crowded. We took place by the hair.
16271,1665935,4,FlexiPMI,28/10/2021,"Good place to spend the night, very quiet although it is attached to a walk. views of the sea and about 6km from the center of Malaga on foot. very nice walk"
16271,1663642,4,Vollstrecker0202,26/10/2021,"Campsite okay for one night, right by the sea but no direct access. Slightly trashed, and right on the main road and immediately after the motorway. And a lot of permanent campers. But the night was good for sleeping with the window closed."
16271,1662870,4,findurfreedom95,26/10/2021,Nice parking just off the highway on the waters edge. No water or toilets but showers along the beach and garbage bins are on site. Petrol station 5 minutes walk and restaurants 10 minutes walking. Space enough for large motor homes
16271,1645970,4,Rafa58,15/10/2021,"Good place spend one night and take the opportunity to visit Malaga from there since at the gas station there is a bus stop that takes you to the center of Malaga, it is 200 mt, it is number 160 and then it leaves you in front, I recommend it, I with my 7.4 mt I had no problem ..!"
16271,1619277,4,Bufer,30/09/2021,"Good place. We stayed 1 day and 1 night during the week and it is a safe and quiet place, with more motorhomes there. Some road noise being close, but nothing very annoying."
16271,1618399,5,nytomc2,30/09/2021,"Spectacular place, with shade very close to the beach, and the lovely people, WC at Repsol gas station 10 minutes from the car park on foot, showers on the beach to get rid of the saltpeter from the sea. I recommend it 100% !!"
16271,1614289,3,estherito,28/09/2021,"The place is well located, has shades and good views. Nearby there are beaches with shower, gas station and small markets. We have been 3 nights. Saturday was fatal to sleep because there are caravans with loud music, cars that come to party, etc. the rest of the days there is no party, but a lot of noise from the road, cars and motorcycles at high speed. We recommend plugs!"
16271,1611533,5,marisaof,27/09/2021,"Great place to spend the night, in the morning you can hear cars because the road is next to it."
16271,1597454,5,Theraptorvan,21/09/2021,"For more places like this !!! Absolute tranquility and a movie sunset, but you have to be aware that you are next to a walk and at 7: 30-8 in the morning you hear people walking and talking."
16271,1542264,4,Gervg,03/09/2021,"We were staying one night at the end of August. It was difficult for us to find the site, as it is not visible from the road and has a hairpin turn. Where they park AC, we spend the night for free and without problem. Quiet place with sea views. We would repeat. Next to the Palo, it can be reached in 7min on foot."
16271,1542075,4,CarlosPerezGarcia,03/09/2021,Perfect parking to spend the night with motorhome / Camper. Very nice views of the beach. the only downside is the proximity of the road and the noise of cars but nothing exaggerated. you can sleep peacefully. right in front you have a promenade and bike path that you can get to Malaga by following it. Perfect if you take your bikes with you.
16271,1535169,4,Ch4Ch4Ch4,31/08/2021,"Very nice view, we did not see the beach showers, large parking lot, unfortunately we had very noisy van neighbors"
16271,1529044,4,pikota23,29/08/2021,Quiet and the truth is that we were in the area of the parking lots closest to the beach and the noise from the road did not bother us. We repeat for sure.
16271,1527160,4,eguzkilore,29/08/2021,We spent 2 nights there. We slept with plenty of AC and vans. There are containers. Possibility to take the bus to the center of Malaga at the Repsol petrol station (10 minutes walk). Very close to Peñon Cuervo beach.
16271,1514006,4,alessjandro,26/08/2021,"Fantastic, legal parking space right on the beach promenade. There was street noise but not very annoying. Dustbin available. (Beach) showers are available at the next beach (Penon del Cuervo - approx. 2 minutes' walk along the promenade). The parking lot is usually very well frequented by mobile homes - however, locals like to use it as a meeting place for parking lot sex."
16271,1509158,4,fercaravana,25/08/2021,Quiet place near the beach. There will be about 50 places. During the day cars come to go to the beach and it may be more crowded. 10 minutes from the beach and 15 minutes from good restaurants. There is a bit of car noise as the road is very close.
16271,1496497,1,Monderland,22/08/2021,"The area I suppose does not deserve a star, but that is how it reads me. We tried to park here and it was impossible because of the motorhomes that were camped, occupying two and three parking spaces by themselves. They saw us wanting to stop and no one deigned to remove their things (THAT IS FORBIDDEN, LET'S SEE IF WE LEARN!). I did not call the miracle police .. To camp, to camp."
16271,1494403,5,Tinou44,21/08/2021,"Very nice sea view. Some pitches are in the shade, which is much appreciated in this season. Many of us spent the night there, but it was relatively quiet."
16271,1478463,4,eli16880,18/08/2021,It took me a little while to find it but the truth is that we slept very comfortably. There were more vans and motorhomes and the truth was that super good right next to the sea
16271,1472411,4,pinfega82,17/08/2021,"We were there this weekend, the truth is that for a public parking it is quite good, with nearby beaches and a super long walk in both directions, nearby restaurants too. They let both day and night pass without problems. There are shady parts. The only thing that there is quite a lot of noise from the road."
16271,1470206,3,jnma-family,17/08/2021,Easy-access parking to the beach below but very crowded as we passed.
16271,1469269,5,Lafamiliacrece,17/08/2021,"Good place to spend the night. Very quiet, with many motorhomes and vans. To repeat."
16271,1466915,5,DoroDetail,16/08/2021,"Perfect place to park during the day and spend the night, without restrictions when it comes to taking chairs out of the van, we have spent a couple of nights without problem, the ideal is to arrive at the last minute to take a place, when people leave the beach, It is a 3 min walk, when I return to this area, I will repeat for sure !!!!! there are showers on the beach and the city center is just 15 minutes away"
16271,1466350,5,MariaYecla83,16/08/2021,"Great site !!!! We have slept one night and the place is super quiet .... yes ... to get a place and to arrive from 7 in the afternoon, which is when the people who go to the beach start to leave."

16271,1421453,4,AngelMaya,08/08/2021,"We have just spent the night, the place is spectacular, very good vibes with the people around, the only problem I put is that in our night here, there were undesirable people who made a lot of noise, although in the end we were able to sleep well and fresh in the middle of August! recommendable!! perfect for spending the night and very spacious parking from 8 in the afternoon"
16271,1407830,4,fer2003,05/08/2021,"Good place to sleep. we spent the night with other motorhomes, vans, trucks and buses quietly. It has several trees that provide shade. Against you you have the noise if you park on the side of the road, I suppose that if you park next to the sea things change."
16271,1376078,5,soledai,28/07/2021,Lots of AC and vans. easy to get. very nice balcony facing the sea. there are no services or water. so cute
16271,1350482,4,gabilandia,22/07/2021,"Perfect place to park and spend the day at the beach, to sleep a bit noisy due to the proximity of the road. The promenade and the bike path next door. We were in June and there were quite a few vehicles, it was almost full."
16271,1349371,5,leiremclouis,21/07/2021,"It is one of my favorite places, I love it. You sleep next to the sea, in a level parking lot, yes, there are no services. The beach is 300 meters away, a magnificent cove. In love with this place"
16271,1348963,5,ManuelBorrego,21/07/2021,Very good place to park and spend the night. good place for motorhomes and a jacket. We have spent one night here and the place is very quiet
16271,1324948,4,juulap,14/07/2021,Shower on the beach 200 meters below.
16271,1318872,4,Edgar14,12/07/2021,"Good place to spend the day and night. quiet area next to the beach. from 7 in the morning you can see movement, people walking on the beach and cyclists"
16271,1285887,4,beatemma,29/06/2021,"Lots of vans and RVs so you feel safe, not immediately overlooking the beach. No font problem, but not gorgeous either. Just what you need for a night outside of Malaga"
16271,1278147,5,NomadasCharlatanes,26/06/2021,Perfect parking to spend day and night. Super well located to go to the beach and coves. Recommended 100%.
16271,1273448,4,miguelbom,24/06/2021,"It is not a bad place to spend the night, more or less quiet and with good views. It does not have services and the place is kept relatively clean if it is not for people who spend the night in cars that have nothing to do with motorists. That is my impression after two nights in the place."
16271,1267328,4,jomaaut,20/06/2021,"Spectacular place, we have spent 2 nights, the parking lot was full of AC and campers, good views of the sea, very flat, garbage cans, beaches and restaurants within a 5 minute walk, the only downside is that many cars park on weekends and that It is very close to the road, but at night not many cars pass by, we slept well, we will return."
16271,1266729,4,rubio2000,20/06/2021,"It's good to go on weekends, it's full of cars to go to the beach"

16271,1230359,2,R.Martin,01/06/2021,"Gravel parking next to the road, we spent the night and a lot of noise from cars. There is a cove of fat sand and stone nearby. The bike path passes next to it."
16271,1222777,4,Juannomada,28/05/2021,Fantastic place to stay far from the crowd having quietty and great views of the bay and the sunset. It´s very close to Playa El Dedo and the chiringuitos. No services but rubbish bins. Some shade for shorter vehicles but behind the first line.
16271,1207366,4,bb.stefkovic,20/05/2021,"Parking near the sea. We used it only for sleeping, we arrived late in the evening, left in the morning. Flat ground, in the evening for a while noise but within the norm and nothing wild. Night and morning calm."
16271,1152202,3,paulinefrate,15/03/2021,Many many complicated people to park this but we still spent 3 nights here. 7km walk from town center but restaurants and bars 10 min walk. We will say that it helps
16271,1146605,3,lostwithamnesia,04/03/2021,Calm & plenty of space off season. Traffic noise 24-7 which makes this spot okay for one night stay.
16271,1139502,5,cpnijmegen,20/02/2021,"Fantastic parking lot with lots of space. Relaxed atmosphere, beautiful view. Garbage is collected every day! On a hiking trail, beaches nearby, restaurants within walking distance. We rented electric scooters for a day (with the Lime app, € 10 per day) to go to the center."
16271,1137221,5,Alan999,13/02/2021,Great for even 3 days ...
16271,1131935,4,elrocio,20/01/2021,Very good little noisy nice view for all
16271,1129893,5,thorretje,11/01/2021,"Good place to spend the night at the Repsol you get very tasty baguette, you can walk there in the morning,"
16271,1114932,4,janalexander,13/11/2020,"Parking space right on the main road, beautiful bike path almost continuously to Malaga (approx. 30 minutes). Garbage cans available, shower on the beach about 500m away. Lots of campers there, police came by twice in the three days, but only drove through. Only 4 stars because of the volume of the street and the mediocre internet reception."
16271,1094009,4,ClaraDuranceau,15/10/2020,"Very good for one night, nice view of the sea, road above a bit noisy but not annoying. Because be careful, the camping air at 300m does not accept vans, just motorhomes, not cool."
16271,1088901,3,KeyserSoze,11/10/2020,Not that noisy in the end by taking the places furthest from the road.
16271,1082243,2,annaberni,05/10/2020,"Didn't like the place. a lot of people passing by, noisy during the night and it's convenient only if you're travelling to Almería, otherwise going to Malaga you have to do extra km"
16271,1078464,5,MelanieSuarez,02/10/2020,"Quiet place to spend the night, without services but 5 minutes next to it you have the beach of the finger with restaurants, supermarkets ... We slept one night with more vans and AC. recommendable"
16271,1068835,5,Nuvitzki,25/09/2020,"Very quiet place during the week, where you can spend the night without problems, we were several Furgos and AC. Lots of space and good sea views"
16271,1059537,3,clovys,20/09/2020,Very nice view and it's clean but noisy the road above and very present.
16271,1059046,4,ele29,19/09/2020,Nice place! We arrived and there was more AC which always gives more confidence .. there is a beach a couple of minutes walk away. You can go to Malaga center for a very cool walk and eat some skewers on the way back. We went from there with the bikes and very nice. The only negative is that it is under the road but the noise has not bothered us at any time .. the noise of the waves predominated;)
16271,1034337,5,Garyvalou,08/09/2020,Very good place. Possibility to park in the shade. No worries to stay several days. Some very quiet nights others with lots of parties !! Showers on the beach
16271,998864,2,fab1366,24/08/2020,"Good place to sleep. but do not leave the campsite because the day is unattended even 10 minutes under the Flight Penne and fracturing of the passenger window and the side porthole. have my Steal credit card, phone, ect ... end of vacation not great. very close fast lane direct access to the VOl car park in 5 CHRONO MINUTES."
16271,940370,4,sonyapipi,08/08/2020,"Flat, with good views, 300 m from the gas station and two silvers (one on each side). Look at the sea on the left side because at night there are some bottles in the area on the right"
16271,931187,4,Vanxus,05/08/2020,"Public parking without services where you can put your table and chairs without problem. We have spent the night together with more Campers. Busy place, near the parking there is a promenade and two beaches with showers."
16271,920273,2,frobles,02/08/2020,"The place is good, spacious and without problem to remove chairs and tables. the problem for me is noise at night. there is a nearby area of large bottle and several groups of young people have been placed next to us at night to give us the tour. In addition to that they have left everything done a dirty shame. For a passing night as we are we can be worth it."
16271,891612,4,Unclealbert,23/07/2020,"There right now, i asked some Spanish users and by all accounts very safe, beach with  a shower 200 metres a way"
16271,859446,5,Voypaseando,10/07/2020,"Spend a night in high season and very calm, nobody came to tell us anything. We were 4 caravans and several cars that went to their own but without disturbing. Good views, I recommend"
16271,841851,4,garcyland,29/06/2020,"Perfect area to sleep, during the day it is full of cars on the beach but at dusk many ac and vans arrive, very quiet area but without services, there are several shaded parking lots and only a container. There is a cove walking 10 min (there is a shower), and a second one walking 15min, in this second one there is a restaurant"
16271,790439,4,jcdc,03/03/2020,Good free parking for a break. road nearby beware of noise. walks by the sea possible. The outskirts of Malaga are not too interesting.
16271,788972,5,horrorhasi,01/03/2020,"Nice place - right on the main street but still quiet. No infrastructure except rubbish bin. Shower about 500m near the gas station. Unfortunately, some motorhome drivers use the small bushes as a toilet or to empty their klos.meerblick."
16271,786532,4,jpg.rocky,25/02/2020,"After finding the campsite up the road was full, managed to get a spot here. It seems like week days you have a better chance of finding a space, weekends cars come and fill the gaps. Very nice location next to beach. M160,M163 leaves across from the petrol station into Malaga, €1.55 pp each way. stopped there four nights, if we had time, may have stopped another day.  Motorhomes rotate quite often."
16271,780296,3,VittorioB.,14/02/2020,"The place is nice, without any service, but with a beautiful view of the Gulf of Malaga, a cycle path in 14 km leads to Malaga, to the north with the cycle path you go to the Rincon de la Victoria. At 1 km in El Palo there are numerous cheap restaurants as well as shops and supermarkets.negative note attached the parking lot passes a freeway and the noise is noticeable day and night, bring ear plugs."
16271,779914,3,Yvesvero,13/02/2020,"Parking a few minutes from Malaga, lots of people even in February"
16271,775944,5,passum,03/02/2020,A good way to stand for 2 days. Unfortunately there are too many unreasonable campers who use the parking lot like a parking space. It's a matter of time if you don't want to be seen as a camper anymore. Add to that the fact that two campers ran the engine for almost two hours. I just don't have the words.
16271,774244,5,VeganLife,30/01/2020,"The place is wonderful! :-) Until a few years ago it was less frequented while now it is always full. Many campers seem sedentary and take up a lot of space with tables, chairs, motorcycles, trolleys, bbqs, solar panels on the square etc. and they use it as if it were a private campsite instead of a public parking lot. :-( These abuses risk making all campers forbidden to park."
16271,773766,1,brau404,29/01/2020,"Please call all users in this area, it is a shared parking with vehicles, it is not an ac area or a campsite, do not take tables and chairs outside and above all do not reserve the site with tables and chairs as If it were your private plot for weeks. If we continue with these abuses the police will ban the parking of AC and camper in this area"
16271,773502,4,LordStretton2,28/01/2020,"Full up last night and full up again now. Best time to arrive is mid morning. Very popular aire, no services but right on the seafront and buses run along the main road into Malaga. A 15 minute walk into local town what’s there not to like??"
16271,771912,5,Motorhome.life.l.l.c,24/01/2020,Great free place to stay. Felt same. Lots of motorhomes. We stayed 3 nights. No services.
16271,770890,3,fred59ha,21/01/2020,Stand here and the parking lot is full. Ok for one night to go to Malaga by bike.
16271,769004,3,TineMine,15/01/2020,"Medium-sized car park by the sea, a lot of other motorhomes. The street next to it is relatively loud. Garbage cans available. small access to a stone beach. In the evening a great view of the illuminated Malaga. The Guardia came over, drove a lap and was gone again without saying anything. Fully okay for one night."
16271,768075,3,ostrunio,13/01/2020,"Don’t come here during weekends, it’s full. Don’t come here with animals, it’s not good place for them. Good for overnight, but road is a bit noisy. Maybe good place to go and visit Malaga by bike or a bus, feels safe. Lot of shadow which is good in summer, but in winter you will not charge your battery."
16271,767762,4,Sarumr,12/01/2020,We were many AC and vans. With sea views. We slept very well.
16271,766510,3,ben033,09/01/2020,"Nice for the night, but no service, far from shops and next to a double track"
16271,766350,3,RotecGo,08/01/2020,Ok for one night
16271,764254,4,derMartn,04/01/2020,"Parking by the sea and behind a street that doesn't bother you at night. Parking lot is not illuminated. There were a lot of womos, from here you can take great walks and ride or bike to the center of Málaga."
16271,763651,4,Jacomo32,04/01/2020,"Arrived late we were happy to find a place here, it was almost full of motorhomes. A little road noise but very bearable at night."
16271,760183,2,Aventuramenuda,30/12/2019,"Comfortable location next to the beach. Large area in which you could easily place about fifty motorhomes, although by the aptitude of some we will hardly be half. A place that for the attitude of a few, we would soon be banned."
16271,758510,2,retter488,28/12/2019,"Large parking lot right next to an expressway. Not bad for a walk by the sea or a visit to Malaga, but I definitely don't want to stay there."
16271,756761,4,digitalvannomad,25/12/2019,"Nice parking place by the see, always busy with other campers, a bit noisy as it's next to a busy road."
16271,755641,3,RotecGo,21/12/2019,"Good parking lot to spend a night, promenade in front of it, by bike 25 minutes to Malaga. 5-6 others were there too."
16271,750881,4,antojo73,07/12/2019,Nice place to sleep although the road could be heard. Within a kilometer walk there is a bus stop to the center of Malaga (€ 1.30 per ticket). Return by taxi from the center is about € 12.
16271,750425,4,plastic604,06/12/2019,"Very crowded always it seems. At least 20 motorhomes when I arrived late last night. Great spot though, right next to the sea. No services. Good internet connection. Right next to road but didn't bother me. Really feels like a campground if you're into that sort of thing."
16271,748232,5,Christoofar,29/11/2019,"Medium sized parking right on the promenade. In the evening there were many other campers here, which makes you feel on a campsite. The most beautiful view of the sea and the proximity to the road hardly bothers, since there is not much operation at night"
16271,745597,3,glaadys,21/11/2019,Nice place but again with rubbish despite the 10 bins in the parking lot. A lot of noise from the road. And a hysterical lady chasing dogs without a leash because there are cats loose. We stayed there for 3 nights. But you can find better
16271,742944,3,Chamois38,14/11/2019,"Noisy parking near the road and the passage of cars, it is a meeting place for men ..... Becomes calmer between midnight and 5am."
16271,740897,5,Jmnhh,09/11/2019,"Pleasant place to spend the night. Many other campers, you feel like you're camping. Nice view of the enlightened Malaga at night."
16271,718468,5,jasminaufreisen,11/10/2019,"Nice environment. Although on the road but from 21 clock almost no car. is located on a beach promenade which if you go on 2 beaches along both have shower and the little more also several restaurants and a small sports park. Gas station is also right there. In theory, there is a bus to Malaga. I did not try but just seen."
16271,713646,1,NoeliayRaul,05/10/2019,We just parked and a guy from another caravan came to tell us that he had just stolen the valet man. We left without thinking. We do not recommend it.
16271,707492,4,susanajorge,28/09/2019,We spent a night here. It has a road up in the park where there is a lot of cars passing by but at night we listened nothing. Really quiet and we felt safe. There were some motorhomes. No facilities. Near beautiful small villages. A bit far to go walking but we had bikes.
16271,700231,5,TheUdis,22/09/2019,Very nice parking near the sea. A bit of movement at night but not excessive
16271,699894,4,poersch,22/09/2019,"Directly by the sea, rocky near there are 2 sandy beaches. Night come and go locals by car. Despite everything was the best place in the area."
16271,662459,2,SevMatheo,27/08/2019,"We stopped at around 9:30 pm, a calm place. But around midnight young people arrived with music and a lot of car passage and come and go. We preferred to leave to find another place for the quieter night. We surely did not have a chance tonight."
16271,660851,4,JoelArbuezGomes,26/08/2019,Beautiful place to spend the night or rest a few hours overlooking the sea! Otherwise there is nothing ...
16271,637567,2,laurentS,17/08/2019,We spent a quiet night facing the sea. But too far from Malaga !!!!
16271,635458,1,campFrance,17/08/2019,"Nice place but all night cars come and go, this seems to be a well known meeting place in the area, moreover the overhanging road is quite noisy .... not to do."
16271,632488,2,NaiaTxus,16/08/2019,"WATCH OUT!! We stayed 2 nights, on the second we slept with a half-open window and tried to steal. There are quite a few vans and motorhomes, but I found it a restless place, a lot of car traffic from people who come for walks, fishing, etc ... several cars seemed to be making rounds looking at the vans. It has a beautiful sunset, beach and bus to Malaga nearby."
16271,618872,4,chachoumuz,11/08/2019,"Nice spot, no services on site except garbage cans. beach shower possibilities at 200m and bus stop (bus 160 or 163) nearby next to the repsol station (westbound) we stayed there 2 nights we felt safe (police doing rounds)"
16271,594998,4,Galita,03/08/2019,"It is the second year that we come to this area. We loved it and we repeated. We have spent two nights and very quiet. Beaches nearby. And if you want to have a little fish dinner at El Dedo beach 10 minutes walk from Tintero restaurant, recommended and not very expensive."
16271,594669,3,Lprosello81,03/08/2019,"We have spent the night there and it is going very well. Several beaches nearby. Very calm. Taking a walk you arrive at Palo beach where you can have a good dinner. In August we were very calm, few people."
16271,569110,3,silviarm,22/07/2019,We have spent a couple of nights this weekend and two others two weeks ago. There is no problem that nobody took you from there is nobody .. you may have a quiet night or find many people wanting to party and not let you sleep. ... there are many garbage on the floor. near the beach
16271,548802,4,tessoliekan,11/07/2019,"Great spot. Stayed here 2 nights. There is a great walk along the shore. Plenty of shade. Almost did not hear the big road above you. Multiple campers. Busstop is very near to go to malaga. Plenty of people passing during the day, so very safe to leave the car."
16271,539534,1,Jeffcath,05/07/2019,"Spend the night, the road passes just above and you can hear the noise of cars. Nice walk but no beach nearby."
16271,518496,5,nicola33,17/06/2019,"Spent 2 nights here (friday and saturday) very very quiet during the night, full of camper only on saturday. Good place, bus station for Malaga only 5min walking (160 or 161). Town center 10min walking, nice beaches around."

16271,495414,4,CarlosCab,28/05/2019,"This is a good place to spend the night, with trees and sensational views, the only thing I would say is that the road passes very close and the noise is high, but when you get the dream is no longer anything, hahaha, what think with the beautiful sunrise."
16271,481685,3,Zdeno,11/05/2019,Very nice parking spot. Nice beach about 100 meter away.

16271,452477,4,peoplecalled,11/04/2019,We also stood here for one night. The place is quite quiet and you do not get much of the street. Gives shade and sunbathing. It's nothing for swimming.
16271,441801,4,samani,19/03/2019,Very busy but nice spot... my satnav tried to take me around a hairpin bend which leads to a small tunnel with I'd guess a max height of 3m.  so don't go this way I had to reverse back up the road...  follow the main road and come back on yourself
16271,441448,3,petitphilou_namur,18/03/2019,"Convenient to spend a night, despite the presence of the road, I had a good night. No service except trash, no unpacking, respect the place and the host country."

16271,431521,4,DerekR,20/02/2019,"Nice location, no hassles. Stayed 3 nights. If coming from Malaga be careful GPS doesn't take you off the main road until after Ripsol Petrol Station. About 10 MH here. Can catch the #M160 Bus to Malaga (10 mins, €1.55), every 30mins from Ripsol petrol station, 300m west."

There are always a few mobile homes and overall makes the place a very safe impression. There are garbage cans, nothing else, but not too far away is a gas station with toilets etc."
16271,424115,2,thehappyland,23/01/2019,I’ve given the place 2 stars because of the views. But I was woken up at about 1.30am to see 4 men being arrested. Police where everywhere searching bushes. I wouldn’t stay here again!

We were shocked to see a camper van with a CD plate draining all its greywater directly from the car park. At 23h we saw also empty his tape Wc over the small ravine. What a dunce!
16271,410942,4,nonacharlotte,29/11/2018,"All right, we do not really hear cars during the night. Bike ride to El Palo along the sea. Very good place for one night to be close to Málaga."

Cars can come and go in the night but nothing too disturbing. Great view of the bay and the landscape. Beach just 5mins away to the left with beach showers. Built up area with recycling bins and petrol station 5/10 min walk on the right. Great place to stay if you prefer quiet nights outside the city."

16271,119821,2,Travelcrazynl,11/02/2017,"Stayed here one night. Bit of an uncomfortable feeling. The parking lot is during the day quiet. During dusk and night constant traffic from cars. In the morning the parking lot is covered in condoms and condom wrappers. They didn't bother us but it wasn't a nice feeling when cars circled the parking lot. The view is nice, during the day a lot of runners, walkers and tourists come by via the path that connects Malaga with the coastal towns. Good for a rest stop, wouldn't advise for an overnight stay"

I highly recommend Camelle's small restaurant ""Café Bar Rotterdam"". Very humble but delicious. Everything is homemade (including the fries!), with local products, few things on the menu because it is made according to the local catch. Great desserts too!"

What I don't like is the lack of civility of some motorhomes, which occupy the spaces with awnings and chairs, leaving no space for other parking users. With these behaviors, the municipalities will end up forbidding us to stay in these environments."

Start at the beach. The other is an old cart track that goes faster. Start at the house over. Place ideal for dogs. At about 9.30 the baker comes. At about 15.30 clock the moving supermarket. IMPORTANT: Space is very clean, so leave again. In 2002, the beach front was black with oil. The Prestige has just dropped around the corner. The local residents value cleanliness."

16338,1963557,5,Kernigit,10/06/2022,"Fabulous place. We swam in the river, sunbathed on the beach, had a beer in the bar, watched the sun set over the river, fell asleep to the sound of frogs, and woke to singing birds."

16338,1682233,5,Quicolas,08/11/2021,"A wonder, surrounded by nature and trees and shade. In high season, very crowded and very lively, it looks like a campsite. A slow delight all year round, perfect to put your ideas in order and soak up your beauty. Cool and a lot"
16338,1680096,5,camperaad2020,06/11/2021,"An amazing place, really beautiful! If you're in the area, definitely stay here for a night(s), one of the most beautiful places I've been. There is certainly room for 40/50 campers and maybe even more"

16338,1520911,5,Mariguti,27/08/2021,"Precious. Very spacious. There were ACs all along the way, under the trees. But there is a lot of space and you can find corners with privacy. There is a walkway along the river Miño, to make a beautiful and very comfortable route, by bike or on foot."

16338,993737,5,forajido,23/08/2020,"We have spent the night here and perfect, everything very quiet and clean, lots of AC and vans. We must take care of and keep these places clean so that they continue to let us stay overnight. Recommended."

16338,973041,5,Sangutrillos,17/08/2020,"A very cool place to spend the night. We arrived at night and with rain and the feeling was to enter an enchanted forest. If you follow the road, you will reach a car park with more light, toilets and showers and a bar. It is a quiet place with an amazing environment to spend the day if it is not raining. The showers are outdoors and overlook the beach."
16338,970807,5,currupipi,16/08/2020,"Great place to spend the night, quiet and shady. The river has a small river beach for bathing and showers, as well as having a fountain and grills. There is a nice bar for a drink, they have good looking food too."
16338,964084,5,LauraHarker,14/08/2020,"Spectacular place, close but not annoying road, with bathrooms 7 min walk (day only), barbecue, beach to get into the river. There are many flies. We have slept two nights so far and we have had no problems, we have taken out chairs and tables. There is no water to discharge. The town is a 15 minute walk away, with a supermarket and bars, worth a visit. There is an AC parking with water service."

16338,876839,5,jorconde,18/07/2020,"Very good for bathing in the river with the children. The beach is small but quiet, you cannot take the car to the shore but it is close. We have not stayed overnight."
16338,784183,3,Jannes_P,21/02/2020,Nice spot with even a tiny little bit of beach next to the (closed) WC and the (functional) outside shower. Plenty of free space to park and now during off-season time it soon gets quiet - except for the disco or what is it that can't be all to far from here and keeps shoving bass sounds with too many bpm into my pillow. It's a pity. - In summer there will surely be a lot more going on here.
16338,741153,4,Sophieee,10/11/2019,Gorgeous spot. We stayed two nights (Fri & Sat) with no bother or noise. Lovely walks. Rained a lot as it’s November!

16338,526775,4,robro,24/06/2019,"Beautiful place just next to the river. WC was closed, but the cold showers were working, albeit the light spray wasn't enough to satisfy the girlfriend's needs to wash her hair :) The place is very busy with locals fishing and walking their dogs or visiting the nearby bar. Due to the cobblestone road it's a little noisy. Nice place nonetheless!"
16338,471077,5,ricardogotcha,29/04/2019,"Fantastic place for a picnic in the middle of nature. River, birds, trees all fantastic. You have wonderful coffee. With great success"

Nothing to do with the spot itself but so loud. Fair amount of locals around until about 9pm. Only about 3 vans parked up for night, so quite peaceful in that respect"

16362,875876,2,RVs,17/07/2020,Good place to park large ACs and visit Gernika but a bit 'soulless' to sleep. Crossing the river there is a very pleasant flat walk that leads to other towns. About a DAY for shopping.
16362,718404,4,quipat83,11/10/2019,Large car park ideally located to visit the village which is worth a visit and to be at 15 minutes on foot. Quiet and peaceful night

Relatively quiet during the night but noisy in the early morning due to main-road on one and railtrack on the other side. In colder months and when you sleep with closed windows this does not cause any problems, but in warmer months and open windows I would not stay here overnight. No service. Close to the city."

16368,2989227,5,jorgeb,19/07/2023,"Narrow town streets but possible with a 7.50m motorhome, although bumping into someone is difficult at some points if there are parked cars. Nice beach and it covers very little, very good for children. It has showers, beach bars and wooden walkways. The parking lot is not very wide but it has places that you can put the overhang of the motorhome well. There is a bar that is also a grocery store, but quite expensive. The bread they sell is very good."
16368,2963485,5,chark7,14/07/2023,"Arrival somewhat narrow. No services. Public toilets and 2 beach bars. Small but pretty beach, especially at low tide (wide and shallow). Very quiet night and flat site."

But it passes perfectly on ac of 7.15 and if it were of 7.50 the same. Beach parking with garbage cans and water fountain. also beach showers. About 10 parking spaces for cars and ac. Very close to Camelle. beach at 5m. you can stay overnight!!

16368,962165,4,GureKabiya,14/08/2020,"We slept one night. Very quiet and with good views. Level ground. We were 6 vans. It is true that the GPS sends you through streets in which some AC would not pass. On the beach there are showers. The bathrooms look good, but at 9.45 they were still closed. Town hall staff were seen cleaning parks, etc. so they still open at 10. A recommended place to spend a night."
16368,917290,5,isaterr,01/08/2020,"Super quiet place, with spectacular views. restrooms open all day right in the parking lot. We only slept in a small van and us, it must be a little crowded town because there were no cars during the day. the squares are not very big but I do not think they are inconvenient because you park a motorhome. Be careful with the GPS that brings you down the odd complicated street."
16368,617113,3,AyAOurense,11/08/2019,"Very quiet place with good parking in front of the beach, clean daytime toilets. Be careful with the access crossing the town, if there is someone badly parked it does not happen with the motorhome; There is a shortcut, dirt track."
16368,583316,1,Suri,29/07/2019,"ATTENTION! Not suitable for 7m motorhomes. or more through Arou you also pass through the town and the locals park. A lot of slope and turns at 45 ° and then you have to go out there. The beach is very noisy, not worth it."

16368,546078,3,flashontheroad,09/07/2019,"We spent here one night, we slept completely alone. It's a good place, with the flat squares and next to the town.

Apart from the bathroom there are no other services and there is only a small bar in the village."

16368,363869,3,bede14,03/09/2018,Very good bivouac. The coastal path to Camarinas is magnificent. It is the coast of pink granite breton in more grandiose. Provide tennis or hiking shoes.
16368,347848,5,boncete,22/08/2018,"Flat parking, in a small town with very cozy neighbors. Wonderful people The beach has a blue flag, which guarantees high quality water and sand cleaning. Right next to the parking lot, there is a beach bar, with very clean bathrooms. We were lucky that the night we spent the night put a movie in a summer cinema."

16368,90881,4,jonma,07/08/2016,"Quiet place by the sea! No parking problem. Beware of the GPS because it took us through the center of town and the streets are very narrow, better to reach the coast road."
16368,24123,5,Ronald.forster,23/08/2014,"To the west of Arou by the seaside road, we arrive at a point of view (lookout point). From there, you can go down to a very small beach without anyone or stay at the point of view where there is a drinking water point. Not for big motorhomes."
16383,3256936,4,Franklin77,04/09/2023,"The view is beautiful. We had an excellent, calm night, lulled by the sound of the waves. For the lower part of the car park (sea view), chocks are essential. The services are in very average condition. Despite everything, thank you to the municipality."

16383,2480376,4,ourvanhelsing,03/11/2022,"We'd give it a 5 for the stunning view, a 3 for the chock-defying slope, unless you are on the grass near the front, and a 1 for the car owners who think it's OK to come out of the basketball hall after midnight and put their sound systems on full blast. Also, if you are the only van ln site in stormy weather, it can feel a bit exposed and isolated."

16383,2185464,4,MC4333,06/08/2022,"Services working perfectly. Spectacular views. To empty correctly you have to stand right on top of the grate, since the platform is not inclined and the water can overflow."

The town is less than a kilometer away and can be easily reached by taking a walk. We entered with a 7.5 meter motorhome without problems. I think any vehicle can fit. To spend the night; Advice, if there is wind that day, go somewhere else."
16383,1675120,4,Globastiaan,02/11/2021,"There is a stray dog that lives here behind the building next to the green shed. If you have dog food with you, please leave some food at the green shed. A sand brown dog. Scared of people and ran away every time. A beautiful stormy night! Easy to reach for us with our 7.5m long camper. At the bottom you can drive around the building and you do not have to turn around."

16383,1417448,4,caballerofrancisc98a,07/08/2021,A great area of 10 but it needs to be pedestrian communicated to Caion that is next door. Some way to walk. The wonderful views. Very good services. Thanks to the city council for the good service.

It kept smelling of chemical waste incinerated, depending on the direction of the wind. That can't be healthy and we looked for a new place for the night."

There is a large car park on the seafront and allowed. Very practical for filling and emptying. Good views, tranquility but no level plot.

16383,1247699,4,Taniarc_87,11/06/2021,Area with all services and with stunning views. The downside that I can put is that it is far from everything. You have to move with the car for any errand.
16383,1224851,4,pepedetui,29/05/2021,"Complete installation for cars, next to the pavilion, but very lonely. I recommend sleeping in the car parks on the beach or in the center of Cayon."

It is more sheltered in the emptied area, in the upper part of the pavilion. The night was quiet, there was an AC apart from us."
16383,1064734,5,Primpiratas,22/09/2020,AC next to sports center with sea views. The parking area is quite steep. If there is bad weather upstairs where the emptying area is flat and is protected by the sports hall. We have spent the night with 2 ACs. Very good views for a magnificent sunrise.

16383,705730,4,DaPads19,27/09/2019,Stayed for one night. Parked at bottom of car-park which meant we did not need chocks. Great view of the ocean. Very quiet overnight - all we could hear was the sound of the crashing waves. We did not use the services as we had no need to. Thank you for this lovely site.

16383,461177,2,ilikegerkins,20/04/2019,"A bit grim really. Very sloping parking and an ok view, nothing special. Probably seem much nicer if the huge ugly building  wasn't there. Didn't stay the night and didn't use the services so can't comment on those. The Police did do a drive by while I was there so that's reassuring. 1 star for the ok view and the other for the Police."
16383,412334,5,nnb,06/12/2018,A great place to spend the night. We were on the December bridge tonight and we were alone. To put something negative that is a little inclined but with chocks without problem.

16383,143252,1,miticoarpege,15/06/2017,"Beautiful photos that have been put, but no one who has put an overview of the huge construction that is there. In fact nobody says that this is the parking lot of the gym. Good only for emptying the toilet. Beautiful view, but like everywhere. The beach, however, is inaccessible, indeed not even seen."
16383,126439,5,laurashu,10/04/2017,Very good views to sleep

16403,3258252,1,Toagla,04/09/2023,We couldn't see the tower because the motorhome spaces were occupied by cars and we didn't dare to park in a car park...
16403,3211370,1,Yeliso,24/08/2023,"We have been today to visit the Tower of Hercules, all the motorhome spaces were occupied by cars, a shame!! We parked in a car. If this is known to occur, a solution should be sought."
16403,3162433,1,davidandlaura,16/08/2023,"The cars park in the spaces designated for the AC, you call the police 092 and they do nothing. A joke, not recommended with a big car. Ours is small and fits in a car space."
16403,3092574,2,INIGOA.,07/08/2023,"The fact that cars park in AC areas is a joke: I have called the local police in Coruña and....words: my bosses tell me that it is AC parking but cars ARE NOT PROHIBITED FROM PARKING, therefore no we fined them... and that I can park in the car zone but if I leave the plot, fine! That's how we go!!"
16403,3070849,3,Escalam,03/08/2023,"We were lucky enough to be able to park well, but it is true that the cars did not respect the spaces that are 7 of the ACs, we were 2 ACs and 5 cars, if it was well marked on the ground and at the front it would be fine, Anyway, thanks to the City Council for allowing us to visit A Coruña in such a central location"
16403,3026092,2,wakatuku,26/07/2023,Passenger cars do not respect the motorhome parking...
16403,2969510,5,AridaneRP,15/07/2023,good place to visit the lighthouse
16403,2961076,5,crichu98,14/07/2023,"We arrived at 3:30 p.m. to visit it, an area set up for 7 motorhomes. There were 4 tuned cars and 3 motorhomes, I notified the tow truck that is permanently there removing vehicles from the area. I'm sorry, but it's well signposted, we already have the site too restricted to go around Coruña on account of people passing by everything. The place worth visiting and very beautiful."
16403,2950572,4,Travelcrazynl,11/07/2023,fine place for the day.
16403,2936999,2,thierrywilliam,08/07/2023,Not much space to park. With the work we had to do a big tour. Nice parking lot for the day
16403,2912833,5,jumave,01/07/2023,6/29/2023 free parking to see the Hercules tower and surroundings for 7 motorhomes but some tourism parks in the area reserved for motorhomes I think more signage is needed
16403,2720534,4,zwoiufftour,03/05/2023,"Self-appointed, unemployed parking attendants see that camper vans take up spaces. Please don't forget to pay a small fee. No parking from 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. Haven't tried... found better places..."
16403,2641419,3,MercheRIIG,05/04/2023,"Day parking only. We arrived and all the spaces were occupied by cars, there are only 8 spaces marked for motorhomes with vertical signs but people don't care and park cars, when there is plenty of room for them. Perhaps they should signpost the squares a little better by painting the ground so that this does not happen, because the ACs cannot park anywhere other than that."
16403,2631740,4,premiervol,31/03/2023,"Convenient, free. A little luck to have a CC place because indeed many cars are parked there."
16403,2614361,4,Charlie0604,18/03/2023,Thank you that there are extra places for motorhomes here! But unfortunately almost half of them were occupied by cars. Maybe the police should come here to look more often and hand out fines to illegal parkers?! It would also be good if the pitches on the ground are properly marked that these are for RVs only. Maybe the drivers will get it then!
16403,2586199,3,Kakoulilimilky,21/02/2023,"parking very well placed for walking on the seafront and to the lighthouse, on the other hand the places reserved for motorhomes are mostly taken by cars. large playground nearby for children very well."
16403,2581923,3,PowByte,18/02/2023,Well placed.
16403,2539688,5,Santiago2022,03/01/2023,Nice parking to visit the tower of hercules and take a nice walk along the cliff.
16403,2385179,3,albaa9597,19/09/2022,There are only 6 places for AC but they are occupied by cars. I called the local police and they told me that they can occupy them but we can't occupy the tourist places. We were lucky that in the end a van came out and we were able to occupy a place suitable for AC.
16403,2257888,1,sterchi,17/08/2022,"Far too few places. The seats are also too small. Be careful, you will be fined for parking in spaces for cars or buses."
16403,2244144,2,cucogabin,15/08/2022,When I arrived this Saturday around 1030 hours there was no room. I parked my fiat ducato (housing van). Outside the motorhome area. But without crossing the lines. When I arrived fine of 100 euros. Watch out.
16403,2219978,2,Gachas,11/08/2022,"It is not clear whether or not you can park the motorhome and I think it depends on the policeman on duty who turns a blind eye or messes it up for you... I was lucky but he told me that where he had it you couldn't spend the night. It wasn't clear to me why or where it could be, but since he didn't fine me, I didn't insist and simply thanked him. A mess!"
16403,2211776,4,laGosi,10/08/2022,"Very large battery parking with an area reserved for AC, but cars park in them, next to the Tower of Hercules."
16403,2200861,2,BertoCaceres,09/08/2022,few places for AC. You can't even stay overnight.
16403,2188461,3,xalocgregal,07/08/2022,"Perfect location, very few spaces to park the AC well, inclined, no AC services. Despite this, we spent the night very quiet and perfect to be the first to visit the Tower of Hercules and continue our trip soon. La Coruña does not take AC tourism seriously"
16403,2150825,1,AMEDU,31/07/2022,"It's silly to call the municipal authorities, they tell you that cars can park in AC spaces, but if you park outside the spaces you get fined and they don't, how well this country works"
16403,2063029,2,lobefurgo,12/07/2022,"Ideal to visit the lighthouse or visit the center, to sleep I doubt it, for the. influence of people and because of the slope of the parking lot, we had to go."
16403,1889505,5,MrsWein,14/05/2022,Great parking lot to visit the lighthouse. This one can only be recommended! Price to go in to the lighthouse 3€ per person! Parking was free and there were plenty of spaces. From here you can also take a stroll along the promenade.
16403,1812161,5,CINZIAontheROAD,09/04/2022,If you want to visit the Tower this is an excellent solution. Car parking in an apparently quiet area. No shadow and flat asphalt. To visit the city you have to walk quite a bit.
16403,1772598,1,LAXIENA,03/03/2022,"When I arrived I went straight to the ACs parking area and it was occupied by cars. I called the local police and they told me they were sending a patrol. When they appeared, they went directly to fine 3 cars parked in the bus area. I went to talk to them and they told me that they were out of control. What a pity that we care so little. By the way I pay my taxes in Coruña."
16403,1762966,5,xunpugnodieuro,22/02/2022,At the end of February only daytime stop to walk on the huge meadows near the ocean. A show to recommend to everyone!
16403,1718678,3,Abrah,29/12/2021,Come early to find a parking space. Ideal for visiting the Tower of Hercules and the city center can be reached in 15 minutes walking along the seafront. There is no problem parking in places that are not typical of motorhomes.
16403,1683105,2,Lauravenard,09/11/2021,"We parked there for the day but the parking is not free !!! A man asks for money to park there, otherwise access is impossible .. it's not official. Lots of cars and very few places for camper vans!"

16403,1640772,1,Veropale,12/10/2021,Motorhome places taken by cars. So no place. A lot of people. Better not to venture there unless you arrive very very early in the morning. Too bad because this parking lot is at the foot of the Tower of Hercules. We are leaving again.
16403,1564574,3,frankie13,10/09/2021,"We went at the end of August with the intention of visiting the Tower of Hercules and it was very crowded, a gorilla helped us find a place. Ideal for visiting the tower and surroundings and the city center"

16403,1483386,2,danysanhi,19/08/2021,"Good parking to spend the day in the city. They are spacious and well indicated that they are a motorhome area, it hurts that people do not care and park cars.No one watches it so it is difficult to park."

16403,1354613,5,Tinou44,23/07/2021,"Daytime parking only very practical for visiting the Hercules Tower and its magnificent park full of pretty sculptures. On the other hand, you have to arrive early to have a place in this season. I parked around 9 a.m., and when I returned around 11 a.m., the parking lot was full, and several motorhomes were turning without being able to find a place."
16403,1353190,4,ElChispi71,23/07/2021,Perfect for visiting the Tower of Hercules. The problem is that sometimes they park cars in the places reserved for motorhomes.

The only one but they are the 3 of always who cook outside, take out chairs and tables, these 3 are the ones that in the end damage the image of the group. Thanks to the city council and AGA for another great area for collective enjoyment, let's take care of it together!"

Now, at 06:30 or so and every half hour the somewhat noisy train will pass by. And the buses that cotcheras are next door start their engines at 07:30 or so and that's Sunday today."
16422,976904,4,siscuriba,18/08/2020,"Very suitable area. The problem is that to load clean water you need a hose with a 1-inch thread, something unusual in our world. To take into account if you need to fill clean water. The rest is perfect; little shade."

16422,869888,5,jafaga,15/07/2020,Spectacular. Some shady squares. We stayed three nights to explore the area with car and karavana. The first night we stayed in a dirt car park next to the area because there were no spaces. The town has a lot of atmosphere despite being post covid time
16422,786469,5,CuniOrge,25/02/2020,"Extraordinary! The area is great, with all services, paved, level and with huge spaces. The town is very close and very beautiful and lively. Just a tip: it is better to skirt along the promenade in either direction than to do it through the old door, the slopes are dizzying. On the other hand it is more accessible. The center is the plaza of the García Naveira brothers"

The price announced by telephone and that once arrived on site were different, cigarette butts litter the floor of the toilets whose hygiene leaves something to be desired, we asked for a gesture in relation to the state of the swimming pool, the state of the infrastructure, and especially the fact that it is not the price that had been announced to us 1 hour earlier by telephone, but no, impossible to discuss. We were still “forced” to spend the night there because of the insecurity present in Barcelona but frankly…. We are not the type to criticize far from it, but it seemed important to us to warn the community"

16432,3088994,3,DouanDunkan,06/08/2023,"very dirty toilets, small camper places 8 meters will not fit everywhere. great location"
16432,3084714,4,leapilard,05/08/2023,"A very nice campsite by the sea, with very welcoming staff available for the slightest problem. We loved our stay at this small campsite! The toilets are clean and toilet paper and soap are always available. Very relaxing :)"
16432,3045744,2,ourban,30/07/2023,"bathrooms and toilets in shameful condition, almost no shade. one star for proximity to barcelona the other for beach and cats. 32 eur for 1 night with a van and 2 people."
16432,2985306,2,Joebo,19/07/2023,"Only good for visiting Barcelona, the pool is green and cannot be used, the only thing missing is fish inside. The shower house is only downstairs next to the reception, so park right down there down the underpass. Showers are ok, toilets are very dirty. Not for families, just to see Barcelona (€2.80 train)."
16432,2978890,4,roadii2023R,17/07/2023,"You have everything that you need. Bathrooms are enough for standard hygienic. Services are also ok. It‘s quiet (32€ for 2 persons) & ‚cheap‘ im comparison to the other campsite. No mosquitos (at least when we were there). Using the Pool is not necessary, because you have the sea in front of the campsite. (Like 5min walk). You can get to barca by bicycle ~ 40min or use the public transportation"
16432,2976587,1,baborloni,17/07/2023,"The place is really neglected. Due to its location on the beach and being the closest campsite to Barcelona (40 minutes by train), it had everything to be very good if well maintained. Unfortunately the location is the only advantage. For the rest, the pool is abandoned, with green water, the facilities are precarious and very old."
16432,2976503,2,OblasserA,17/07/2023,"Ideal for visiting Barcelona, as the train station is nearby. Beach can also be reached in a few minutes. Sanitary facilities, well...if it doesn't have to be... Operator very friendly"
16432,2965702,1,sdf,15/07/2023,"Hello, the only advantage is the train station 5 minutes away on foot. The land is a real mess, between the noises of the road and the trains it's the stereo. the swimming pool has been out of order for a while the water is green all that's missing are the frogs, and you can see they don't care, come on at the sea they say.. more than average sanitary facilities, the image of the rest. even for one night it's misery, to flee to flee..."
16432,2935298,4,cosinize,07/07/2023,"It has seen better times, perhaps covid has had a hand in it: until 2019 it had a Routard license plate. Anyway, excellent for visiting the city with the R1 train at 300 m, zone 2 fare. aAlso good prices: 2 adults, two children, electricity = €50. Clean toilets and showers, functional and clean loading and unloading area. within walking distance beaches and restaurant bar on the beach La Rotonda."
16432,2933880,3,SaraMargherita,07/07/2023,"Top: 1. friendly environment, relaxed atmosphere. 2. friendly staff even if ""improvised"" 3. 5 minutes walk from the station and the beaches. Flop: 1. an entire block of toilets not usable, some of the others don't drain 2. largely dilapidated and abandoned 4. swimming pool not usable (green water) 5. wild pollarding of the splendid trees: little shade and pain in the heart."
16432,2896761,2,HaraldSchell,27/06/2023,"Too expensive for this hole. Everything is very old. Not necessarily clean. We only found it good that there was a lot of shade and the proximity to Barcelona and the train station. Otherwise...well...unfortunately the only parking space around barcelona, so we'll probably come back if we're on the road there"
16432,2888007,1,ronaldjenny,24/06/2023,"We were not really happy when we read reviews. But this is really not possible, we don't care about new or perfect, but here the toilet is sprayed a bit clean with a garden hose from a distance. The bar and terrace are closed. Everything is dirty . Swimming pool is green. Toilets upstairs are closed. You can only come here for one thing, which is to visit Barcelona. Such a shame !"
16432,2863708,1,Klaus-Claudia9,17/06/2023,"Be so good and don't drive into this place. Were there on 06/15/2023. Not recommended, place is very unclean unkempt. Toilet facility below all dignity. Pool was a green cesspool. Price for camper, 2 adults, 1 dog and electricity, grandiose outrageous 52 euros. I turned around immediately and then went to the Barcelona campsite for about 10 more, for 42 euros and a great infrastructure."
16432,2832320,3,caddyot,08/06/2023,For 1-2 nights it's ok perfect to explore Barcelona. Sanitary facilities are very old and not really clean.
16432,2830539,4,sophiekoffeman,07/06/2023,Very good located! Close to the beach with a really nice beach bar where I was at least twice a day ;) 30 mins with train to Barcelona so great combination of beach and city. Also close the a harbour with the best paella and other restaurants. Camping is old and not too special but perfect for the basics!
16432,2796855,3,HYB455,28/05/2023,"Beach and beach cafe just opposite. Campsite is a bit old, swimming pool not usable. You can choose the place, under trees, no plots. Showers are hot, washrooms are old and cleaned every day. I would come back, I like the nonchalance. No cafe/restaurant/shop. Lots of cats, very cute. €34 incl. electricity 05/2023"
16432,2790109,3,emijonadba21,27/05/2023,Very functional campsite. Ideal for Barcelona visitors. Sanitary facilities getting old but clean. Don't expect luxury. Very nice owner!
16432,2787616,3,theauroravan,26/05/2023,"Good place to stay for visiting Barcelona, of course not a campsite to have a camping vacation. It needs some TLC & is not the cleanest but has everything you need. No restrictions on shower time or where to park. It’s not cheap but the best option to stay if you go to the city. The train ride is quick, cheap & easy to figure out. Definitely a good spot to stay for your visit in Barcelona."
16432,2773929,1,p4nlutisi,21/05/2023,"Convenient because of its location by train to Barcelona. Otherwise moderate to poor camping in relation to the price (€37). The only good sanitary facilities are the hot showers. The rest is filthy. No renovation has taken place in the last 15 years. The cycling distance to Barcelona is also disappointing (20 km) and, above all, hardly accessible due to poor infrastructure and signage."
16432,2730292,1,allroad5,07/05/2023,I went there sucks! Piled up on top of each other and for this connection you disconnect someone else! Never seen such a messy campsite! to flee. Money pump!
16432,2722420,4,JanisBecker,04/05/2023,"Yes, the place is not well maintained and looks a bit whimsical. Sanitary clean! But the operator is very nice, often makes his rounds around the square and checks the rights. Places can be occupied arbitrarily and there are also really nice corners. The price is high - 93€ for 3 nights without electricity for 2 people and van. But super fast to Barcelona! It's worth it!"
16432,2717725,5,Caradohildegard,02/05/2023,"We arrived here today, friendly operator. Yes, the price is reasonable, but this is certainly due to the proximity to Barcelona. So far everything is ok. Can't complain!"
16432,2715338,1,MaYaontour24,02/05/2023,"I don't understand a single positive review, except that it's in a great location for easy access to Barcelona. And that is shamelessly exploited. Price underground from 36€ for NOTHING! Old ok but not reinvested a dime, unkempt, dirty and bad energy! Secure ? No barriers, no fences, no cameras! NEVER AGAIN! But: The groundskeeper is very friendly!"
16432,2713737,1,tc303,01/05/2023,"Camping seemed closed. Website not available. At the reception it was closed, two young people wanted to introduce us. Cash payment only. Didn't look serious. We drove on."
16432,2708557,4,DavidGranier,30/04/2023,"nice and functional campsite, clean toilets and showers. it's not super luxury but more than enough for the two of us with the van. We were very happy especially since the train station is 5 mins away, the train takes you to Plaça de Catalunya in 30 mins for 5€20 round trip. In April €24 per night, which is reasonable, plus the campsite is quiet."
16432,2702745,4,abcsuermondt,28/04/2023,great campsite for a visit to Barcelona. 2.5 hours walk along the coast. back by train. Abdul nice boy. He only accepts cash payment. city camping which is dated but great for 2-3 days. toilets and shower are there and there is hot water. don't expect too much.
16432,2694855,3,papygreen,25/04/2023,"Perfect for visiting Barcelona which is 25 minutes from the central square for 5€60 round trip. The toilets are correct without more hot water and cleaned every day. Please note that I was asked to pay in cash, which requires you to plan if you stay a few days"
16432,2688848,5,juliyea,22/04/2023,"One of my absolute favorite places for years! quiet, green oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle perfect for exploring Barcelona's sea views right on the beach, through Masnou underpass: great little place Sanitary facilities always clean friendly Dog beach & dog park (free running) right next door Yes, the sanitary facilities are old and it's expensive. BUT absolutely authentic and likeable!"
16432,2687289,3,KennyTheKamper,22/04/2023,"Served it’s purpose to allow us somewhere safe to park and leave the van to explore Barcelona. Way overpriced. Tiny pitches and only one set of bathrooms open. Lots of graffiti. But only 10 mins walk to train station. If you want to explore Barcelona it is safe. Cost us 44€ for one night for 2 adults, 2 children in 7m motorhome."
16432,2676282,3,RastLeg,17/04/2023,"Close to town and quiet by R-Bahn. Overall unkempt facility. Pitches partly on terraces. 2 people with electricity €76,- expensive. Toilet clean with T-paper but old! Narrow showers with no storage space similar, fortunately hot water."
16432,2669008,3,GrandCanyonKA,14/04/2023,"The location of the square for a visit to Barcelona is probably unbeatable due to the rail connection. We paid €37.25 per night for two adults and one child with no electricity. The sanitary facilities are actually no longer modern, but they were always clean and stocked with soap and toilet paper during our stay. We spent two quiet nights here in April 2023."
16432,2666466,3,luckyfreddy,13/04/2023,"You get a relatively safe parking space if you need electricity and supply and disposal. Sufficient for a visit to Barcelona. 10 minutes to the train station. Ticket round trip €5.60. Travel time 25 min. Sanitary facilities can be used in an emergency. We preferred the installation in the vehicle. If you are looking for a place for a family vacation, you will probably be disappointed here."
16432,2662126,2,deklet,11/04/2023,"Two stars for the location: beach right in front and 10 minutes walk from the train station for Barcelona center, horrible welcome, we paid €37.50 per day (I realize that's on the customer's mind ) too expensive for the services offered sanitary very dilapidated and not clean."
16432,2659599,4,Lasac_p,10/04/2023,"It has all the services, it is close to public transport to travel around the city, it is very quiet. It is quite expensive for the quality it has and is completely maintenance free."
16432,2659163,3,LesGlobeurs,10/04/2023,"Nice view, close to the train to the center of Barcelona by the R1 line, fairly quiet, service ok. the price is too excessive €50 for 2 adults, 2 children, 2 dogs, electricity, drainage ok"
16432,2648126,5,Marinaranurata,07/04/2023,1st star for proximity to Barcelona. The train station is 5 minutes away and the train runs very regularly to the city center 2nd star for the nice groundskeeper who is always on site 3rd star for the quiet on the pitch. 4th star is for the sunset directly on the beach access through a tunnel near the train station 5th star is for the cute cats on the square :-)
16432,2633333,4,ElectroBaer,01/04/2023,"(VW T5) We stayed here for a day and night to visit Barcelona. Very nice reception. The place itself is nothing special, but you feel comfortable and safe and it's quiet. The sanitary facilities are old, but clean. Just the right thing for our purposes, the price of €31.50 (2 adults + van) is a bit high, but considering that you can visit the city carefree and save parking fees there, we thought it was ok."
16432,2631664,3,Tiddel83,31/03/2023,"Plus points: free choice of parking space, hot shower with pressure, friendly staff and safe parking space. Good connection to Barcelona. Negatives: unkempt and loveless (meanwhile) and expensive. 37-45€ (with electricity). Costs sometimes so and sometimes so ...."
16432,2614060,4,HannahZech,18/03/2023,"We found this campsite perfect for visiting the city. When we came back to our camper in the evening, an employee was with us after a very short time to check whether we really are the owners. So you can leave your car here all day with a good feeling. The sanitary facilities are a bit older and therefore look dirty."
16432,2597518,3,FredFlintsone,03/03/2023,"Value for money is not right. It's a real shame, this campsite would have the potential to create something nice from it...unfortunately, the place looks very run down. We still give 3 stars: for the friendly staff and the good connection by train to the city. For the hot shower & the toilet paper, sanitary facilities were always clean."
16432,2596526,3,Michel1248,02/03/2023,"3 stars only for the good connection to Barcelona. Otherwise rather 2. The san. Facilities are rather difficult and very old and poorly maintained. However, the employee was very friendly. We could choose the pitch. Even if the road goes right past it, it was quiet at night."
16432,2589411,2,Lagalik,24/02/2023,"We spent 3 nights (2 adults, 1 child and a van) for 133 euros. Fortunately we have our bathroom in the truck, because we could never have used the worn and very dirty toilets of the campsite. Fresh cat droppings every morning on our site. Campsite open to all winds day and night. Only advantage: El Masnou station (R1) 10 min walk to Barcelona."
16432,2588611,1,KarlCarstenKatja,23/02/2023,"This campsite only gets one star for its proximity to the city centre. The facility is getting old and really ready for demolition. There is cat droppings everywhere and it stinks because of it, don't want to know what it's like in summer. Was glad that we didn't have to use anything on the site with our camper, especially since the price is absolutely exaggerated at just under €37 per night, including electricity."
16432,2586549,1,carstenontour,22/02/2023,"UNFORTUNATELY the only alternative to visit Barcelona. The sanitary facilities are underground! Absolutely not recommended. Cats walk around the square. There's cat poop everywhere! Totally overpriced for the general condition. In Germany this place would probably be closed by the authorities. Many write ""getting old"". In my opinion, the place should be demolished!"
16432,2585829,2,fred1960,21/02/2023,"Not happy with the facilities here. Dirty bathrooms with leaves and dust in the basins. No welcome and when Abdul turned up we had very little information about the place. Very expensive for what it was (€38 per night 2 adults, small camper van with electric) Only plus was the proximity to the train station to get into the city."
16432,2584393,5,madb88,20/02/2023,"Excellent location, quick and easy public transport to downtown Barcelona. I couldn't find a better place in a safe place closer to the city center. Water intake and waste water disposal are provided, so I don't really understand the bad reviews given because of the outdatedness of the community bath, unless someone comes with a tent."
16432,2578310,4,EssehayliClaire,15/02/2023,"the location is perfect 5 min walk from el masnou station. the train takes us to Place Catalunya in 20min for 2.80 euros, the showers are hot and clean. payment only in cash."
16432,2568940,2,MaxBro1995,05/02/2023,Stayed 3 nights in February to visit Barcelona. With about 30 € / night (without electricity) for a VW bus and 2 people quite expensive - only cash. The facilities are completely run down and not maintained at all. But at least the water pressure in the shower was good. Great connection to Barcelona (25 minutes by train). Please note: there is no return train after midnight - not even on Saturdays
16432,2549737,3,Mikesurlaroute,12/01/2023,"Despite the previous comments, it is indeed an old campsite, the young man at reception (Abdoul) is very nice, the sanitary facilities are dated but above all clean. Maintenance is done twice a day. Close to the suburban train that takes us directly to Barcelona! We will gladly come back. If you are looking for a castle go straight."
16432,2543653,3,travelwildmychild,06/01/2023,"Dated campsite but well located. Near the station from which to take the train that allows you to reach the city center comfortably, 10 minutes on foot + 30 minutes by train (p. Catalunya), buy tickets for 2 zones. The structure is run down and there is no maintenance or cleaning in the common areas, but the water in the showers is hot and there is paper in the toilets. Quite expensive compared to the service they offer. 2 adults + 2 children in van = €44 per day, without electricity"
16432,2536025,2,KarolinKlawes,01/01/2023,10€ for cleaning the toilet and filling up with water.
16432,2534706,2,m.freiwald,30/12/2022,"2 points for proximity to Barcelona hot shower water. The place from the structure itself (terraced) is nice but much too expensive 37 € / night, Womo 2 pers all plumbing. We were here from 27.-29.12. for Barcelona sightseeing for more the place is not."
16432,2521489,2,vio1984,14/12/2022,Expensive at 40 euros a night for 2 people with a caravan. Sanitary facilities dirty. Unfortunately not recommended. 2 stars because the operator was very nice.
16432,2520805,2,GiuliaPanna,13/12/2022,"Neglected, perhaps because it is low season, a bit expensive, it is not correct to charge even two 2 and 1 year old girls. Excellent for the train connection with Barcelona."
16432,2500234,1,corricavallo,19/11/2022,"Dirty, neglected and bathrooms beyond indecency around the campsite at least 3/4 abandoned caravans and tents full of waste of all kinds…. Not recommended."
16432,2481178,2,JohannaMugabi,03/11/2022,It’s very loud because of the street and just not an inviting place in general which makes it hard to justify 35€ for a night with a tent. The washrooms were really dirty as well.
16432,2472237,3,lu1110,30/10/2022,"Late arrival possible. Unfortunately, dirty sanitary buildings and quite expensive. Small café on the beach about 5 minutes walk from the campsite"
16432,2467240,1,fan4womo,28/10/2022,Viewed. Neglected and overpriced. It's out of the question.
16432,2463984,3,11fh,26/10/2022,"Great spot to visit the city, but the toilets and showers are very old. Payed 39€ a night for a van, two people and electricity. However we could choose the spot and, although you hear the train from time to time, its quiet at night."

16432,2423435,3,Nike26,04/10/2022,Paid 23.05 for a T5 van without electricity with one person. I was allowed to choose my place. Sanitary facilities really run down and not really clean! It was fine for me for one night..Advantage with the R1 in 35min in Barcelona! And Van stands safe.
16432,2420291,3,nedellecmimi,03/10/2022,"an ideal campsite for visiting Barcelona, 200m from the station, exiting on the left. the beach is also close by passing under the railway tracks. forget the swimming pool ..... the toilets were not cleaned every day ..... the gentleman at the reception was very friendly."
16432,2411032,3,Westsidemobil,29/09/2022,"Beautifully landscaped campsite which unfortunately could use some maintenance. Likewise the sanitary facilities.

16432,2405612,2,CRTP111,26/09/2022,"place because Great location close to Barcelona with public transport. Like many before, I unfortunately have to say that the hygiene leaves a lot to be desired. However, the terraced complex has a certain charm."
16432,2398698,3,bubuvantana,24/09/2022,"We used a pitch here for 2 nights. (Sprinter 2 people €62.50). The location was great, you are in the center of Barcelona in about 20 minutes. The facility manager was very friendly. The facility wasn't overcrowded either. The sanitary facilities, which are relatively unhygienic, are a pity."
16432,2393801,2,VerenaMuecke,22/09/2022,"Actually a nice place with a lot of potential. But nobody seems to really care. The pool run down, the filled water looks scruffy and moss green toilet/shower are rarely cleaned. overflowing bins, dirty toilets. 37€ per night with electricity. Much too expensive and only cash. There is a stop within walking distance from where you can be in the city center in about 25 minutes."
16432,2393498,2,nicelnic123,22/09/2022,"Actually a nice place with a lot of green, but the office was locked and a man who was sitting around with his buddies on the premises checked us in, kind of weird guy. Toilets upstairs are closed, electricity is only available on the left side of the square. No pool, bar is closed, sanitary so semi. Far too expensive 37 € with electricity. Only cash payment and you can go look for the employees.."
16432,2387526,3,Pianne,20/09/2022,"Ideally located, close to the train station for Barcelona. In an old time…! this campsite had a beautiful swimming pool… the sanitary facilities are in disrepair. The welcome is friendly. Prefer to park at the top of the campsite, away from the road and the railway tracks. But during the school period, noise from schoolchildren from 8am. We understood that the campsite was sold to a promoter…. so check it out..."

16432,2339586,4,SimonStaufer,04/09/2022,"Perfect campsite to explore Barcelona, close to the train station and the beach, pitches under the trees, very quiet. The sanitary facilities are no longer the best, but they still work great, are clean and there was hot water for showers, too. Campers and 2 adults without electricity 62 € paid for 2 nights. Was ok for us as it's better than a smashed window in Barcelona."
16432,2324852,1,MichelGilbert,31/08/2022,it's not even worth 1 star we turned around on arrival because we had planned to stay 3 days. good for a one night stopover
16432,2294043,2,lorenzofumelli,24/08/2022,"This campsite is good only for the position it has near the train station to get to the center of Barcelona, otherwise it does not offer excellent services, the place is not very well kept, for example the abandoned swimming pool with stagnant water is clearly visible."
16432,2290962,1,SebastianBaltes,23/08/2022,"Dreadful. The person responsible can never be found at the reception. The toilets and showers are dilapidated and covered in graffiti. Almost all sanitary facilities out of order. Only cash is accepted and 31.25€ for a VW Bus and two adults WITHOUT ELECTRICITY is too much. When I left, I argued with the person in charge about the price for a long time, but without success."
16432,2287582,3,JujuEisenbahn,22/08/2022,"Campsite with a lot of potential, which unfortunately is not used. Playground dangerous because boards have broken out. Pool has certainly not been used for 20 years. Everything is getting old, but the campsite is highly recommended for a city trip. 35 euros a night. At first the staff couldn't be found and then unfortunately didn't speak any English."

The staff is very nice, but doesn't speak English. Nevertheless, they try very hard and they manage to communicate. The train station with a good connection to Barcelona is very close, the beach with a beach bar is also within walking distance. Recommended campsite, we will be back!"
16432,2287361,5,floundinesontour,22/08/2022,"due to lack of space we had to go to this place. With the thought of staying 1 night, despite bad reviews, we let ourselves in on it - 4 nights later we unfortunately had to leave (end of vacation) We were so excited about this unique place and didn't want to go home. Of course it's getting old, but everything was super clean, the staff was extremely nice. We'll be back ❤️"
16432,2282955,4,Martenrb,22/08/2022,"Ideal to look at when passing through Barcelona. I wouldn't vacation here for a week. But if you want to see Barcelona and want to park safely, this place is ideal. The Platzt is getting old, but that also has an advantage: all the stuffy campers stay away. During our stay we only met nice friendly campers."
16432,2239048,4,GabyMarte,14/08/2022,"we want to see Barcelona and he's brilliant at that. works without pre-booking. the place is clearly getting old, but there are hot showers, relatively clean, close to the beach and the train station. we couldn't ask for more!!"

16432,2199386,2,claurin,08/08/2022,"Positive: 10 minutes along the road to the R1 (Caution: 2 zones!), one of only three campsites in the Barcelona area, insofar as there is relatively no alternative, as the other two are better rated and therefore booked up faster. Cons: Overpriced for the quality of the place and the services still available. Seems only to be squeezed but little cared for."
16432,2191477,4,JulijaOs,07/08/2022,"Although camping looks a lill bit abandoned, showers and toilets working properly, and train station is 10 min. walk away. Pretty much everything we needed. Good option to leave a van and visit Barselona. Nothing was stolen, we felt safe."

16432,2170325,1,housseaumorgan,03/08/2022,"we stopped for one night and will not stay longer, quite expensive camping we have paid 50 euros for just a location and electricity and nothing more because the swimming pool is not maintained it is all green and closed. toilets next to the reception which are open and it's not the top ah and it does not take the card you have to pay in cash."
16432,2158418,3,patouillere72,01/08/2022,"1st return for 3 years, the campsite no longer resembles what we knew before COVID. the bar, the swimming pool, and part of the pitches are closed. the campsite has lost all soul, it's a shame. Remains the interest for the proximity to the beach and the train station to visit Barcelona."

staff were friendly and helpful though and after the toilets had been cleaned they were much better. Generally not somewhere you would want to stay for a long period but very handy for the City."

16432,2132027,3,Tatino,27/07/2022,"Honestly I am amazed, it is a good position to reach Barcelona, it is not large but it degrades the extension, accessibility to the sea (underpass at 200 meters), black and gray water discharge, disused service block and the other, extremely dated, but clean. Swimming pool but completely abandoned! No bar service. 37 euro camper, 2 people electricity cash only. It would be a little oasis if a little more maintained."

Very bad value for money: for a mobile home and 3 people 42, - per day. 1 point because nothing was stolen. The CP is probably only there because there are no other options for camping here."

We had a good time there, stayed 3 days. Walk to train is 5-10min   30min transit and you're in the heart of the city. Well recommended!!!"

If you want to spend the night in a ""orderly"" camper paradise, you might not be in the best of hands here. But if you are looking for a special place in the best location, this is the place for you: small, safe, personable, a bit shabby, toilets/showers clean, everything very well looked after by Abdul, the empathetic campsite manager. Top"

By train to Barcelona in the city well during the day. But the place is not maintained and is totally run down. There is nothing left except dirty showers and toilets (only 1 house left). It's a shame that everything is rotting away there."

16432,1976580,4,bolzakcamper,14/06/2022,Ar first camping seems like it’s abandoned but it has all the basic necessities. Pool is shaggy but you have 5min by walk to the beach. It’s quiet and very green! (Not quiet at 4am when because of hens and roosters). Owner Abdul is a super nice guy as well as the “security” Italian guy. Toilets are old but clean. We loved it there and it was super safe. We stayed there for 1 week.
16432,1967903,3,MobyDickKoeln,11/06/2022,"So... that's true about the pool. That's a pond. The sanitary facilities are very, very old... but they work. Warm water. We had three nights to visit Barcelona. It was perfect for that purpose. Friendly guy at the reception. To start excursions very well there at the train station. Rear seats are nice and quiet."
16432,1905681,1,kikoencamino,21/05/2022,It is the closest campsite to Barcelona and is well connected by means of transport to get to Barcelona and its surroundings but it is a semi-abandoned campsite and now run by two guys. Bar / restaurant / swimming pool closed. Old and dirty bathrooms. TOO EXPENSIVE since it offers almost nothing we paid € 37.50 per night in mid-April.
16432,1899637,2,familyof5invan,19/05/2022,"This place other than the location, which is SO convenient to Barcelona is a shithole. The owner, hoses it off the bathrooms daily, but not a cloth or disinfectant in sight. Take advantage of the location and safe area but don’t expect to be enthused by the facilities. Location wise, your on one train (R1) to Barcelona in 30 mins. Very expensive - 51 euros for our family of 5 for one night."
16432,1897088,1,ParaMuecke,17/05/2022,The location is very good to visit Barcelona. Beach within easy reach. But that's it. Sanitary very old. Not maintained. Pool water was dark green... Front desk hardly any English. And for that in 14 days round trip Spain France the highest price off-season.
16432,1848068,3,the.tofus,23/04/2022,"Very dirty and old. The ugliest and most expensive campsite we have been to so far. Spent one night to go to Barcelona by train, but TOP! The beach 5min away is beautiful! It was very quiet even though the train and expressway are only a few meters away."
16432,1843557,3,BarbaravdW,21/04/2022,"Main reason to visit this camping is to visit Barcelona by train. For the quality of the camping it’s expensive. Half the bathrooms are roped off, but the main bathrooms are clean and the water warm. In the beginning there were some stray cats begging at our pitch, but they stayed away when they learned we wouldn’t feed them."

16432,1807292,4,AnnaLisaPr,05/04/2022,Currently only a temporary help on site. So you have to be lucky to meet someone. Sanitary facilities ok. The proximity to the train station to go to Barcelona is perfect.

Quite clean toilets and showers, a little dilapidated. 5min from the train station. 20min by train to go to the center of Barcelona. Only downside is the price. Excessive! 45th pr 4 adults without electricity (provide 6th extra). Stay in February, few people"

Sadly it will close next year."
16432,1749524,3,sebjohn38,06/02/2022,"cool campsite in this season, you come in and set up where there is space. See you with Abdul the next morning. Nice, a little expensive for the services. The next day we preferred to join the Las 3 Estrellas campsite. cheaper. What is good about El Masnou is the proximity to the station and the frequency of trains, buses, Barcelona half an hour away."
16432,1736107,3,alanzepec,17/01/2022,"The primary quality of this campsite is that it is close to Barcelona. It is also quiet and clean. However, it is old, not very organized and for the price they charge, it needs to be better. This place needs investment."
16432,1729308,2,Bugeye,07/01/2022,Two stars because you can only pay cash and man at 'reception'(...) can only speak Spanish. We're 2022! Two stars cause proximity station and quiet at night(only in winter...?). Absolute shame that a city like Barcelona that gets x millions out of tourists each year doesn't invist in proper infrastructure!
16432,1728459,4,Olimpijka19,07/01/2022,Parking close to the station - very good communication to the center of Barcelona. Green and clean. Close to shops. Nice service. Clean beach and a dog park next to the campsite.

16432,1713812,3,Domitineo31,21/12/2021,"Average campsite but closest to Barcelona, excluding both at the end of the airport runway to the southwest of Barcelona. Convenient, the train station 10 minutes away on foot to go directly to Place Catalunya at the top of the Ramblas, for 5.6 euros round trip per person and 25 minutes by train. Price 37.20 euros / night, electricity included…. in cash. Expensive for a 2 *, not too much choice on Barça, many are closed."
16432,1713715,2,cama9693,21/12/2021,"Small, very old campsite. Lots of stray cats. Operator very friendly and uncomplicated. Great for a day in Barcelona. But nothing more. Showers and toilets Old and dirty. Whoever comes here shouldn't expect too much."
16432,1702506,5,maestrorocker,03/12/2021,"I really liked it and recommend it. it works on the basis of trust. Even if they arrive and find the reception closed, enter and they will soon find you. Very close to the beach and the train station which for around €5 goes to and from the city centre. Pay attention only to the size of your motorhome. Mine is a 6m Integral and maneuvers have to be done with some care. I recommend!!!"
16432,1690335,3,steira25,15/11/2021,"The back seats are surprisingly quiet despite the busy road and the train in front of the entrance; Standard is very, very simple, but everything you need is there.

I made myself hot water with an immersion heater and a bucket for the battery shower. 30 euros per night are cheeky. The employee there was okay, but only spoke Spanish."
16432,789126,3,popotefamily,01/03/2020,"good for proximity to Barcelona and the train station is a short walk away. for the rest, the campsite should refresh the toilets. good the water is hot and mixers for the sanitary area at the entrance. the big criticism, the emptying of cassettes in the gray water hole. and there is a hose to rinse, but people also use it to recharge the CC tank (yuck)."
16432,774422,4,ursomajor,31/01/2020,"Very good camping spot to see Barcellona with great access to city, train and beach. Super friendly people and very accommodating, and yes maybe it is not a resort, (thank god and this is a plus) but a great place to see the city. At 30 eu a night it’s the right price to be in an urban area. We’ve paid higher prices for a “resort like” place and received less services. We value kindness simplicity and genuine human interaction. This place affords it all. Strongly recommended!!!  we stay 3 nights, happy travels to all."
16432,765409,3,wernermueller,06/01/2020,A very safe alternative for visiting Barcelona. Usually has its price. Place calm and nicely laid out. Sanitary facility at the reception is ok. Dog friendly. 2 people plus electricity about 35 €.

16432,759926,3,ArianeP,30/12/2019,The campsite has fulfilled the job we asked it: not too far from Barcelona (30 mins) and secure. We were lucky on the spot level as we arrived early and on weekdays. It is true that after the motorhomes are more crowded. 30 € per night without electricity during our period. Spot did what we asked for: not far from Barcelona (30min by train). 30 € / night without electricity.
16432,757328,2,kellycamp,26/12/2019,"The campsite is located close to a busy road and a railway. Bad value for money, 30 euro camper and two people. Definitely in the top ten of the worst campsites ever seen and the country of masnu too!"

He said his colleague would be there in 2 minutes. After waiting 25 minutes and asking further where his colleague he just shrugged. Other Spanish campers tried to take over the check in. But all very dodgy. Everything lived and no great sanitary facilities. After further negotiations on the price with the supposed owner and no understanding, we drove on. We should pay 45 € per night for a Bulli and 2 persons 2 days before the season change. Overpriced!"

Prohibitive price. 7 minutes to get out of the campsite in the morning (a stop in front of an uninterrupted stream of vehicles). I crossed Barcelona without visiting and am not ready to return. A star because not possible to put zero.

The only convenient advantage to visit Barcelona, ​​because direct train to Plaça de Catalyuna, 300 m from the campsite. Lamentable wifi if you are far from the bar.

We had a place a little high on the left from where we see the sea a little bit and we did not hear the cars on the national. Sanitary medium, camping price a little expensive but it is still much better to have the camper safely in a campsite rather than a parking lot in Barcelona where there is risk of burglary. For around 19 € we had a map of 10 transports for Barcelona. Trains every 10 minutes. 45 minutes from the campsite to Plaça Catalunya! Station at 300-400 meters. Nice pool for hot days."

Only found one tap - on the water dump. A longish walk into town - but the nearest beach is a dog beach. Restaurant not serving.
16433,2203985,3,SinaCie,09/08/2022,"Well, Spanish: loud, full and sanitary so the most necessary. The pool area is new and great. The mini market on the square too.

Excellent bakery and pastry shop in a small street in the center where we have the best cappuccino of the last 25 days between France and Spain.

We arrived around 5pm to visit Arguedas and its cave houses. Perfect for visiting Las Bardenas! We did not use the services (it works with tokens to buy at the center).
16443,3100311,4,Celine42380,08/08/2023,Many locations. Dusty floor. Ideal for visiting the Bardenas desert. Did not use the services.
16443,3097710,5,estelle.nadine,07/08/2023,"This year we had no flies, mosquitoes or bad smells. this is certainly due to the wind blowing in the right direction. The area was full because there was the feria with the release of bulls. The party was happening in town. Not a sound in the area which was very quiet. Good atmosphere between motorhomes."
16443,3085283,3,sdx,06/08/2023,good parking fulfilling its purpose. to visit the bardenas reales. Be careful between March and September you cannot hike there. we can only stay on the track stuck between a military firing zone and a protected area for the reproduction of birds! And there is no info about it on their website. it is only once there that we are aware. very disappointing
16443,3080557,4,bavaria1185,05/08/2023,"Super location without electricity but free thank you, a very nice village especially during the fiesta period I recommend stopping"
16443,3061698,4,ingrid517,02/08/2023,"great place to visit the Spanish ""desert"": the bardenas reales calm, large, water point, drains and even municipal swimming pool!"
16443,3054872,5,sandycmoi,01/08/2023,great place very quiet. We found a place even when arriving around 10 p.m. the view of the troglodyte houses is great and we were able to visit them because it is possible to take a walk even very late (there is lighting). Please respect the place
16443,3054805,2,adri_ozzy,01/08/2023,"Well located to get to the bardenas desert. Very large parking lot for vans and trucks right next to the space provided for CCs. A bit complicated to find the right road to get there from the village. Right next to the troglodyte houses, which can be visited on foot. No services."
16443,3037276,4,RobinCassan,29/07/2023,very large space for very many campers. not always very flat... strategic position for the bardenas desert
16443,3029648,5,Kapucine77,27/07/2023,10 minutes walk from the municipal swimming pool (6€) quiet and clean area. Possibility of doing the services by buying tokens from the merchants of the village. 4G and TV ok.
16443,3029392,5,bsphoto,27/07/2023,Thank you for this free parking space with V/E. The night was very quiet. The place on arrival at 5 p.m. hardly occupied and packed at 9 p.m. But there are alternatives right next door. Perfect for visiting Bardenas Reales. We were in the park 7 a.m. and almost had it to ourselves.
16443,3020271,4,choubinvan,25/07/2023,The spot is great? next to the main desert entrance. Don't arrive too late because it's a bit of a battle for places but the view of the troglodyte houses is just incredible! Yes it is hot and yes there are mosquitoes but it is definitely worth the detour
16443,3014613,4,Jenny_5222,24/07/2023,Great location for visiting the Bardenas Reales the next morning and with the troglodyte caves behind. Lots of mosquitoes at this time and flies. Quiet location.
16443,3004760,2,theorg3,23/07/2023,"Very beautiful landscape near the cliffs, but despite its horrible night with a lot of mosquitoes."
16443,3004556,4,Alexandriiine,22/07/2023,"Perfectly located for visiting the Bardenas. Close to the starting and information point of the desert motorized circuit. We did not see any sanitary facilities indicated in the advertisement. Lots of people creating some noise. Seen on a magnificent cliff, and close to the cemetery."
16443,3003251,5,KnausBoxStarXL,22/07/2023,"Free parking space! Ideally located to navigate the semi-desert of Spain. Starting point about 6 km away. Supermarket (Poxim, Spa) within walking distance. Everything perfect!"
16443,2967452,3,N1C,15/07/2023,"A park up with no particular special features … apart from the coloured LEDs lighting the old cliff dwellings. Rather noisy, but sufficient for one night to get an early start to visit Bardenas Reales."
16443,2966849,5,Heinzlife,15/07/2023,Very good free place. Close to the Bardenas Reales. Great location and view. There are a few caves to explore behind the square. Supply and disposal a few meters outside the pitch. Supermarket is a few minutes away by car. The city itself is rather sleepy and doesn't offer much to see.
16443,2966815,5,MeterreauChloe,15/07/2023,free and relaxing motorhome area despite the number of campers present. Located 5 minutes from the Bardenas desert by car and within walking distance of an old troglodyte village that can be visited. We also observed a magnificent sunset from this village perched high up.
16443,2965650,5,zairarc,15/07/2023,"Clean area without unevenness and delimited, with water services. There are some cave houses below that are worth visiting and are illuminated at night, near the town, municipal swimming pools and a pum track for scooters and bikes. Perfect for visiting the Parque de las Bardenas and Sendaviva."
16443,2958566,4,lesdecouvreurs,13/07/2023,"One night, the spot is nice with the troglodyte village behind, possible departure for a short walk in the desert. Small flat, places are a bit tight so not possible to eat outside, and no shade. But it's a free air, and almost flat, so thank you to the municipality for this provision"
16443,2950129,3,leroy62,11/07/2023,Convenient for parking one night before going to the Bardenas natural park. Quiet night. But little shade or none at all during the day and lots of flies and mosquitoes. We had to eat in our motorhome so as not to be devoured. But it has the merit of being free and at the foot of the cuaveros that can also be visited for free with explanations in these caves dug into the rock. Thanks to the community for this.
16443,2936085,2,OTM21,08/07/2023,"Convenient given its quiet location for one night, too bad the flow of gray water clogged and black water drain full !! never seen that!!"
16443,2931425,3,ellieandwillt,06/07/2023,"Convenient place to park overnight before visiting Bardenas Reales the next morning. The cave houses behind are pretty and very interesting. It gets busy and the spaces are narrow and slightly sloping - please don’t take up 2 spaces by putting your awning and chairs out as this is not helpful for anyone looking for a space in this busy place. There are a lot of mosquitoes and flies around, the grey water drainage was blocked and overflowing, and we didn’t take water so not sure if this works yet. The WC water does work. Fine for a night but not the nicest place."
16443,2928184,2,lukasmarocci,06/07/2023,"The area is good, many squares, in a beautiful place and with all the services. the police should control more tourist places and take care of tourism, as we are motorhomes and campers"
16443,2927007,5,vanlifejvb,05/07/2023,"Parking a little ""factory"", narrow places, and large volumes of motorhomes. Town itself is uninteresting apart from the cave houses located just behind the parking lot."
16443,2922284,5,ginette-royer,04/07/2023,super nice place with a magnificent view of the troglodyte caves very calm clean
16443,2922031,5,schoppenvrouw,04/07/2023,good place to discover the las bardenas. rather tight spots and close together. no problem for us because the las bardenas are close by. toilet discharged. there are a lot of flies and mosquitoes in this area at the moment.
16443,2921662,5,Minotavrvs,04/07/2023,"Quite a secluded area, with views of the caves, curious to visit. Next to Bárdenas Reales. Against: the only faucet enabled is the black water one, many mosquitoes. Sign indicating that for drinking water and electricity buy tokens in shops but it seems that the machine It was in disuse. We loaded water disinfecting the tap well. Foreign tourists camping: this is prohibited! The sign indicates it."
16443,2877124,4,djipi5,21/06/2023,"At the entrance to Bardenas. Small gravel pitches, lots of motorhomes, no shade. Free. Not used the services."
16443,2847059,4,JessLeg,12/06/2023,"Drainage ok but water available only for WC (the box for having other services has disappeared, too bad!) Quiet and clean parking, with space at this time, and located just next to the entrance to Bardenas."
16443,2831828,4,cawotte83,08/06/2023,Extra spot before visiting bardenas. Nickel. Arrived at midnight. There were 2 spots left in the parking lot. Quiet night. Toilets at the end of the cemetery. Bring your toilet paper.
16443,2829906,5,jeff4064,07/06/2023,Very pretty spot! Top restaurant and bar in town and small convenience store
16443,2826295,5,Wildapple,06/06/2023,"We arrived at night and there were still a few spaces left. You stand directly at the rock caves and can start from there into the desert. It is about 700m to the local bakery. We had a quiet night. Attention: Pay attention to the signs, you cannot drive through the town with the small streets but may have to drive around it depending on the direction, then it will be no problem."
16443,2819157,5,enzo92,04/06/2023,really very very nice place especially a set of houses set in this mountain the parking lot is very large and vast you can easily move over and over again days
16443,2813638,4,HectorHoose,02/06/2023,Fabulous views at this parking place. Relatively flat pitches although we needed one ramp at our pitch. Walks from the parking both into the countryside & the town. Service pitch is just before the entrance although it has been vandalised & so only black & grey waste disposal. If the town would repair it to enable fresh water it would get 5 stars.
16443,2812764,4,MDB72,02/06/2023,Very convenient for visiting the Bardenas desert. Facing the troglodytes. For water you have to buy a token in the trade. Had a good night despite the many motorhomes.
16443,2809470,4,Tigomgom,01/06/2023,Good but pitches a bit cramped (not to mention a table and chairs that come out on the pitch next door…). Functional emptying area just before the entrance. For more ease go to the large car park in front of the troglodyte houses.
16443,2796013,4,Matt33,28/05/2023,"Perfect for visiting the desert, the entrance just 5 min. At the foot of the troglodyte caves which our son really appreciated! Water drainage possible. Water refill it will be necessary to buy tokens in the shops of the city."
16443,2795019,4,Andrea-Dinis,28/05/2023,"Area at the foot of the caves and next to the town. The area itself is not very large (15-20 seats) since it is an area with a large influx of AC/vans but practically next to the area is a field where there would be another 40 vans. Unfortunately, as in the private area of Valtierra, simulations of shots are heard to scare away the animals from the fields. Be careful with fearful dogs."
16443,2785583,5,jurij94,25/05/2023,"We spent there few hours, nice for stop and walking around. We didn't sleep here."
16443,2783416,3,giotilinewally,25/05/2023,beautiful very large cp.
16443,2780907,2,lagrandebanshee,24/05/2023,"Positive point: the location towards the cave houses. It's spacious, it's free. But suddenly, it's crowded. Otherwise, the water point is out of order. No toilet, so it's dirty…. We would have liked to realize earlier that there is another small CC area at the Sendaviva animal park, 5€ per night with all the park's services and toilets accessible 24 hours a day. We recommend this one instead."
16443,2765275,5,sastraka,19/05/2023,"We loved it. In the heart of the town and with views of the famous cave-houses, which are also illuminated at night and can be visited. We had a great rest, I would absolutely recommend it."
16443,2761315,4,lutz448,18/05/2023,"The driveway is not well signposted, the GPS leads through narrow streets in the village - very difficult. Coming from Pamplona, first take the main road to the end of the town, then you will see a sign - follow it. Otherwise everything great."
16443,2758413,5,Joce56,17/05/2023,"Thanks to the city for this beautiful location at the foot of the cliffs. Very quiet and very large due to the immediate proximity of the car park of the adjoining cemetery. There are many toilets at the end of the cemetery. The city has the charm and calm of its authenticity, it's very pleasant. Do not forget to visit the very moving troglodyte dwellings..."
16443,2756084,4,nathanpyr,17/05/2023,"Good for one night in transit. A lot of people but it does. On the other hand, very dirty outside the car park: Wee, poop, waste and paper everywhere. (Lack of civility. But that belongs to everyone…). Beautiful sunset on the heights and balconies of the houses in the rock with the church in the background."
16443,2756057,5,ChristianSGL69,17/05/2023,Parking dedicated to CC 20 delimited spaces next to the cemetery and at the foot of the troglodyte houses. Another larger parking point on clay ground with 30 undemarcated spaces located 50 m before the P CC. Water point and all drains between the 2 along the very low traffic street. 5 min walk from the CV and the 2 restaurant bars. Very calm night.
16443,2754339,4,gustripbeatz,16/05/2023,"Not bad place to sleep, but there are quite a lot of people and the toilets indicated we did not find them"
16443,2751594,4,JeanRenard,15/05/2023,Great & free parking space right by the famous cave dwellings and at the entrance to the Bardenas Reales - from here you can start a circular hiking trail directly or you can enter the nature park via a gravel road. Supply and waste disposal available and after 3 minutes on foot you will find a small supermarket in the parallel street.
16443,2749263,3,dragonqueen,14/05/2023,"The square is beautifully situated below the ancient rock dwellings and is ideal for visiting the Bardenas Reales. There were a lot of mobile homes here at the weekend. The place itself is rather desolate with lots of rubbish in the main square. The bakery was closed on Saturdays. The disposal point is easily accessible, even for large mobile homes, and is practical."
16443,2747424,5,Audrayvanlife,13/05/2023,"Location at the top. Super well placed, at the foot of hiking and mountain biking trails. 3 possible tracks. Near the entrance to the Bardenas desert. The small town of little interest, but with 2 or 3 open terraces, otherwise it is also the desert in town. I recommend this location."
16443,2743327,5,Jbx87,12/05/2023,"Very large and pleasant area, free service, facing the caves, very quiet night. Nice village 5 minutes away, many terraces of bars and restaurants. Thank you to the municipality for your welcome!"
16443,2740981,5,famillealliot,11/05/2023,"Very large area with plenty of seating and relatively clean. Very calm night facing the caves of Arguedas. Free water and emptying. About 6kms from the entrance to the Bardenas desert, Info point at the entrance. Thanks to the community."
16443,2718918,4,Woopy78,03/05/2023,"A large space, necessarily with a lot of vehicles around. Perfect for spending the night in peace after visiting the desert, drinking water and toilets (not clean, but which have the merit of being there) in the cemetery."
16443,2712069,4,Radiio2,01/05/2023,"Lots of vehicles but plenty of room. Free emptying, filling and draining. At the foot of the Bardenas and you can visit old houses made in the mountains. Two minutes from the town center. Don't be very calm. Yes, obviously with so many vehicles there is dust, people don't know what to expect… Thanks for sites like this."
16443,2709652,3,Hodlok,30/04/2023,Quite basic area but well located to see the Bardenas or get closer to Sendaviva. The services are clearly insufficient and poorly maintained for all the motorhomes in the area (motorhome area + parking). Tonight we have been like 150 motorhomes…
16443,2709340,1,SBusje,30/04/2023,"A desolate place. Over 200 vehicles arriving after 11pm tonight. Then in the morning departure to Bardenas Reales with traffic jam. The 2 hiking trails on the SP are the only ones I would walk as hiking trails, even though the signposts burned after the fire. The street in the BR is totally overcrowded and the poorest are the walkers and cyclists in the cloud of dust from cars and motorbikes"
16443,2708203,2,odnanrefai,30/04/2023,"With the number of caravans and vans that use this area, you should be a little careful and add services, even if they are paid. A single source and area for emptying water, no public toilet, for at least 200 vehicles that have spent the night here, seems less than insufficient. I don't know who owns/responsible for the place, but it could be better."
16443,2706847,4,leschoupinous84,29/04/2023,Very nice area at the foot of the cliffs!! Close to the desert and the city. No electricity and the water is coin operated.
16443,2699673,4,Rone13,26/04/2023,"parking very well located to visit the Bardenas, near an area for emptying gray / black water"
16443,2699414,2,lodu82,26/04/2023,very spacious motorhome parking lot with far too many people. we stayed there for barely 2 hours and we found it quieter elsewhere. good location to go to bardenas.
16443,2696373,5,FlorianColas,25/04/2023,"it's crowded here but it's a good spot to visit the Bardenas. There is no need to buy tokens for water and sewage disposal. Just use it, it's free"
16443,2695173,5,TheDutchTraveler,25/04/2023,"We have been here for 2 nights on the large parking lot next to the official motorhome. There are dozens of campers and it is pleasantly busy. Slept well, good view and good location for visiting Bardenas Reales. You can discharge toilet and water here. We did this in Tudela."
16443,2694703,3,Alvaro83,24/04/2023,"A good place to spend the night near the town. Quite well leveled, some service but quite dusty, left and with quite a bad smell. To visit the town or Las Bardenas perfect"
16443,2693819,4,sisilapomme,24/04/2023,"Very good quiet parking lots of motorhomes. Dirty and gray water no problem but no drinking water the distributor is broken. Good location for visiting the bardenas. The entrance is 6 km away with an information point, then visit by motorhome on the track, no problem."
16443,2690482,4,lagaille85,23/04/2023,great parking to spend the night before going to visit the Bardenas.Magnificent at the foot of the troglodytes and illuminated with all my colors at night as well as the magnificent sky. The only downside is clean water.
16443,2687481,4,NanoCatSammy,22/04/2023,"Great location, incredible views, much more room than in Tudela. Right at the foot of the caves."
16443,2686157,4,karinakate,21/04/2023,"A lot of campers, but really nice, quiet and clean. Good for one to two night stay"
16443,2685727,3,SandTill,21/04/2023,"Calm night, the view of the troglodyte houses is great, the start of the slopes and the information of Bardenas is 20 min by bike, follow the road to the left out of the car park."
16443,2683348,5,loul450,20/04/2023,"parking very well located to visit the bardenas. we parked 2 nights, very quiet. I confirm a lot of dust. gray and black water emptying possible."
16443,2678528,4,Alpamasun,18/04/2023,"We stayed here for 2 nights. Dusty parking lot and 80% occupied over Easter. if you want to be self-sufficient, absolutely top. From here you can make the tour of the Parco Bandenas Reales. We did too. However, campers are quite polluted by fine dust. Adventure guaranteed. supply is available. Drainage and fresh water as well as toilet disposal. For passing through and visiting the park Top."
16443,2673304,4,DadRoux,15/04/2023,"Very practical for visiting the Bardenas, very large but we are a bit on top of each other. Possibility to drain but no water to fill the tank (only at the toilet cleaning tap)"
16443,2673249,5,oscarmike,15/04/2023,"Great spot. Perfect for visiting the beautiful desert area.  Very large overflow next to Aire.  Good 4G. Water, WC and grey water services.  Highly recommend.  Not very much in the small town, only a couple of restaurants on the tiny square.  But still a great spot."
16443,2673114,4,Bongo65,15/04/2023,"Thanks to the municipality for this free area near the Bardenas Reales. There is clean water, gray and black water so all that is missing is electricity with euros and it will be perfect since there is a field of solar panels above. If you have a problem with your bikes go to Cyclos Marton (puncture) and Bardenas Bike (battery charging and mountain bike rental)."
16443,2671355,4,pamuxa,15/04/2023,Good area with all emptying and filling services. Close to the center and good for routes.
16443,2671219,4,florentcpt,15/04/2023,"Superb very quiet location with a magnificent view of the troglodyte habitats (possibility to visit them). Clean area, access to the drain and black water, however the clean water did not work. Restaurant nearby within walking distance."
16443,2670415,3,leathibsven,14/04/2023,"Perfect if you like to be parked next to each other. Paid services. But troglodyte dwellings a few meters away and an ideal location for visiting the Bardenas. A few shots / firecrackers were heard in the early evening (party in the city or hunters!?), but very quiet night"
16443,2666380,5,cacou996,13/04/2023,Very practical for sleeping near the desert! many vans and motorhomes. direct access to several hiking trails
16443,2658579,5,CathDan40,10/04/2023,"We stayed one night. Very quiet place, close to the center of Arguedas and at the foot of the caves to visit them. Good place to rest after visiting the Bardenas."

16443,2653066,4,maitxu84,09/04/2023,"It is huge and it is very good, we have spent three nights. The bad thing is dusty. But otherwise great, the town is very good. Recommendable."
16443,2646050,5,laurasc28,07/04/2023,"We slept in the parking lot next door and used the toilets. If you don't have a place in the area, the parking lot is great and super big."
16443,2640722,5,Lunatica66,05/04/2023,"The parking area is already worth it because of the area below the cave houses, 11 km from the Bardenas Reales, to visit motorcycle or bicycle recommendation as it is a gravel road. Also next to it there is a large open field where you can also spend the night."
16443,2639319,3,manoki68,04/04/2023,No drinking water and no electricity available (station defective). Gray water and toilet emptying is possible. Simple parking space for an overnight stay with a self-sufficient vehicle possible.

16443,2625451,3,audomaro,26/03/2023,"Free area, it's true, lots of places, especially for large motorhomes with trailers, it's easier to park in the parking lot next door. The emptying of XV cassettes is condemned, but it does not bother some nags to empty their cassettes on the gray water grid."
16443,2624612,4,bella6644,26/03/2023,"We spent a very good night there. The pitches are a bit sloping and a bit narrow, but the place is very pleasant and really not far from the Bardenas desert."

16443,2617710,3,pierrotdu33,20/03/2023,"Lots of CCs are on the gravelled area before the area on the right. there is actually a lot more room. Note that behind the official delimited area, there is a path that overlooks the (roofs of) motorhomes: wouldn't the problems of stone throwing by young people come from there? The visit of the Bardeinas desert at qql 15 minutes is sublime :-)"

16443,2611553,4,WLMHoogendoorn,16/03/2023,"Slept here for two nights. No hassle and nice and quiet at night. The cave houses are very beautiful to visit. No electricity, but water and also the possibility of emptying. The emptying area is not clean. Early in the evening all places are full. There is a lot of parking on the gravel field next to it, but that is not the intention."
16443,2611032,2,walsch,16/03/2023,The place is unfortunately completely overcrowded and unfortunately blocked for others by some permanent campers .... Too bad
16443,2602798,5,KimArndts,08/03/2023,"I spent two nights here. fortunately had no hassle with young people. It's very cool to visit the cave casas that are right behind the camper place. from 3 p.m. it was dripping full and in the evening all places were occupied. a little further on is a large open gravel area where you can stay if it is full. water didn't work today, but draining water is possible."
16443,2601674,4,Andi66,07/03/2023,"I stayed there for one night in early February. The illuminated caves are a beautiful sight at night! VE was working at the time. IMPORTANT: Do not use the navigation system and try to reach the parking space through the village, it is simply too narrow for campers! Follow the signs, the approach takes place in a large loop from the south across the fields."
16443,2600848,3,nowrongturn,06/03/2023,"I chose not to stay after a walk around the town. The cave houses are interesting but I didn’t have a good feel about the place.  As others have said follow the signs and not the sat nav- the emptying is on the approach road , not attached to the parking.  There isn’t power available despite the signs saying there was.  Great to have a free parking spot but it wasn’t right for me."
16443,2597393,4,MobilLoewe,03/03/2023,"The negative reviews are incomprehensible. A great place to stay, one night great. V&E was not possible, therefore a star deduction. A ""hip"" tapas bar in town, on the Plaza de los Fueros, large selection, nice staff, super cheap, well frequented, many happy guests. We were the only tourists. When paying we were almost ashamed... Top, top, top!"
16443,2595168,4,hasenteufel,01/03/2023,no youngsters throwing stones at the mobile homes last night. Great base for driving into the desert. Expect at least 4 hours to drive through the desert. Simply fantastic!!!!
16443,2592500,4,fvela,27/02/2023,2 nights and day rather calm but Saturday evening 5 young people threw stones at CC. the police intervened and made 3 rounds. No more worries on Sunday evening. Ideal and relaxing place at the foot of Bardenas and Cuevas! To have. Thanks to the community
16443,2592414,1,AlejandroCH,27/02/2023,"The area is not bad, but be careful! A group of kids throwing stones at the Vans/Ac, these incidents are repeated daily, we left the place because it is not quiet!"
16443,2592029,2,MelInAVan,26/02/2023,"The spot is very pretty with the caves BUT there are still (in view of the previous comments) kids who threw stones at a camper (25/02). The police came, there was no other incident. The car park is 10 minutes by car from the information center (the entrance to the park)."
16443,2590896,5,Familleballade1,25/02/2023,great place to spend 2 nights at the gates of Bardenas.
16443,2589824,2,Adri9228,24/02/2023,"Convenient parking to see the caves but very quickly filled. On a Friday at 10:30 p.m. a group of young people came and knocked on the van door once. Not wanting to wait to see if they come back and given the comments from the parking lot next door, we preferred to leave to avoid being thrown stones and having damage."
16443,2589561,1,mymyl,24/02/2023,At 11 p.m. young people came to stone the motorhomes. I think they were aiming at the satellite antennas (so I got nothing) I tried to film them but they ran off while profaning insults... I didn't wait for their second visit to the another way and I left. I strongly advise against this area and this city.
16443,2589445,3,finchen2020,24/02/2023,"Super nice location directly under the cave village, which is illuminated at night. Spent a very quiet night! Ideal for trips to the nearby Bardenas Reales, which are highly recommended! The only point of criticism. Very bad disposal/supply! Gray water blocked, toilet emptying impossible, no fresh water! Anyway, thanks to the community!"
16443,2588714,5,AntoninAime,24/02/2023,"Magnificent location facing the caves of Arguedas! Quiet and flat night, parking easily filled even in February. Ideal for departure to the Bardenas desert really close!"
16443,2588324,5,heinzanke,23/02/2023,"What more could you ask for? Free and secure parking - absolute peace and quiet at night. Very good location. The caves 30 meters away, the desert 5 km away. Thanks to the community."

16443,2586607,4,Freenam,22/02/2023,"Pitch flat, in front of the cave dwellings. Everything you need. Baker Trigo Dulce bakes delicious baguettes. Arriving in good time secures parking spaces - despite the off-season, everything is occupied in the evening."
16443,2584490,4,Trottie,20/02/2023,"Neat free overnight stay with marked out places next to the old cave houses that are beautifully lit at night. Great starting point for a bike ride through Los Bardenas. At 11 pm some jolly youngsters came walking along the boardwalk, after that a quiet night. Waste container without glass container. The village has a nice bar with a large terrace, a butcher, greengrocer and a baker."

16443,2576035,5,cdulbecco,12/02/2023,beautiful place. ample parking. with everything free except water. The pretty town with bakery and supermarket. the great caves. crowded in february but perfect for good weather
16443,2566674,5,Romy1306,02/02/2023,"Great location for this aire. Services 50m from the site. Town with a few bars and shops a short walk away. At the bottom of troglodytes dwellings worth visiting. Night lights show in the evening. 
Plenty of room for small and large vans."
16443,2565402,5,pauliky8,31/01/2023,"The water works with jets that are purchased in local shops. The emptying of gray is free (it is a little before reaching the parking lot, on the left) and the overnight stay too. It is next to the Bardenas Reales and literally attached to the Arguedas caves. Very good option to sleep in that area"

16443,2554835,4,tasjavanrymenant,18/01/2023,"Good parking to spend the night before visiting the bardenas. Quite busy, even in January. In the morning you can also walk to the village from here for a visit to the bakery (about 10 minutes walk with google maps.)"
16443,2552985,3,Chd1,16/01/2023,"Good starting point for Bardenas, otherwise nothing to complain about."
16443,2549843,4,ManniMaster,12/01/2023,"Great place. We stood for one night. There aren't too many pitches, but you should always be lucky for the winter season."
16443,2548217,5,freedompeople,10/01/2023,"Good place, of course very busy because of the Bardenas Reales. Despite that, we slept peacefully for two nights. The disposal works well, we didn't get any water - only works with tokens, but the ""pay box"" for the tokens was dismantled. Maybe just because it's not in season? We can recommend the place."
16443,2547770,4,vanlifelina,09/01/2023,"Good spot, lots of other campervans and felt very safe. Near to town. Water and electricity for 1jeton (?)"

16443,2528100,1,degazinet,25/12/2022,"I found the signage to find the area insufficient. we bothered to try to enter by following the GPS indications through the city while passing it then following the CC emptying signs, parking lot, we get there directly"
16443,2518302,4,sarabara,10/12/2022,Large area with several delimited plots with some logs between them. The filling and emptying service is out of the area but it is very good. A few minutes from the town square.
16443,2517790,5,layottes,09/12/2022,"Nice convenient area to visit the park. Be careful when arriving from the north: some GPS take you through the small streets of the village, narrow and at right angles. It is best to go south of the village and come back to the area passing near the cooperative. Only one water tap in operation at the moment for WC and drinking water."
16443,2514692,5,veri,06/12/2022,"Thank you very much Arguedas Town Hall, magnificent area, let's take care of these places."

16443,2503578,5,Xperience,23/11/2022,"Perfect perfect perfect. An area of 10. The site is very beautiful, you have the caves next to it and it is very quiet. Many ac and vans I found a place for little. If there is no space before there is a large car park where there were more ac and vans. Very close to the Bardenas Reales. That is if you respect the issue of removing chairs, tables and awnings. You don't get anything. Thank you very much to the town hall. I will be back."
16443,2502992,5,JuliaGarrels,22/11/2022,"Great views of the caves, nice locals and good walking area just behind the caves."
16443,2497641,5,Kellyb411,16/11/2022,Lovely and easy after a day in the desert. The caves quite cool to see also!
16443,2496585,4,Cruizer76,15/11/2022,"Free, beautiful location, caves and desert right outside the door. Great for 2 to 3 days. Supermarket around the corner. Water probably broken at the moment. Anything goes with disposal. Approachable from any size."
16443,2489799,3,VanlifeCat,10/11/2022,"Nice view of the caves and convenient starting point for Bardenas Reales - unfortunately the supply and disposal is defective, a sign has been put up. The parking space was completely overcrowded yesterday, and people also parked in the second row. Still a quiet night, we felt safe."

16443,2486318,3,suziepark4night,07/11/2022,"Perfect for a night before or after visiting Bardenas Park. However many people, no services (apart from emptying dirty water). The view of the troglodytes that you can visit is nice."
16443,2485406,2,Lenaweyrich95,06/11/2022,"Very handy for visiting Bardenas Reales the next day. However, the smell of the surrounding agriculture is not negligible, it stinks quite badly. Otherwise the parking space is relatively straight, fresh water was defective."

16443,2478168,3,5OnTheRoad_Amel,02/11/2022,"Has the merit of existing, practical for sleeping before going to Bardenas. Huge and stuck tight, no particular view. Nice troglodyte caves to visit on foot. pay attention to the terrain in case of rain"
16443,2477093,2,Camille37,01/11/2022,"The area is full during this holiday period, we are crammed together but it has the merit of existing to go and visit the desert. Big negative point: the pestilential smell! Park as far away from the business as possible. The police come by night and light up the camper vans, people hang around near the recycling center so avoid this area as well."
16443,2476046,4,dicky974,01/11/2022,"Area in a superb setting, at the foot of the troglodyte houses. It is necessary to arrive early because, from 4:00 p.m., the area is very full during this period of school holidays. Large parking lot not very far in addition. Possibility of emptying and cleaning the toilet box. Smell in the air due to nearby farms but we get used to it. Very calm! Too bad the cellars are not illuminated at night, it surely depends on the time of year."
16443,2470867,5,bubuvantana,30/10/2022,We stayed here for 1 night with our Sprinter. Ideal place to visit the national park the next morning. Nice residents and a small supermarket in the immediate vicinity. The emptying station also works. It's a very popular pitch.
16443,2464244,5,Family-Bruynooghe,27/10/2022,"Super large car park with services for every type of van and motorhome. The original motorhome parking area and next to it an open plain for at least 50 motorhomes. Very busy, lots of motorhomes but still quiet and peaceful during the night. Ideal for visiting the caves. At night, the caves are beautifully lit."

No need to pick up to park. we can empty the toilets but the coin mechanism is torn off so no drinking water. remains the tap for black water. do not stand near the cooperative because the smell is very strong. we have the opportunity to visit the troglodytes and pretty hikes around this car park.

16443,2454106,4,JorgeOria,20/10/2022,area right at the foot of the cave houses of Arguedas. Ideal to go see the Bardenas Reales. we arrived on thursday 10/20 at 17:00 and full. Right next to it there is a large esplanade next to the cemetery where you can spend the night without problems. quiet place without noise.

16443,2436011,3,RabeaKurka,10/10/2022,"OK for one night. Proximity to the Bardenas Reales perfect. Many mobile homes that have moved to the neighboring gravel parking lot. We have not used the VE, so no statement can be made in this regard. The place was more appropriate for us. Nice play of colors in the caves in the evening. 8.10.2022"
16443,2435826,2,Goerch,10/10/2022,"Nice place, but very narrow and sloping. The neighboring square at the cemetery is more suitable. However, thanks to the community for providing it"

16443,2425897,3,abeille79200,05/10/2022,CC area ideal for visiting the desert during the day flies and mosquitoes in the evening and the smell of chicken coops but you can't have everything free and without inconvenience for one night it's ok

16443,2410100,4,ericaubourg,28/09/2022,we are a bit on top of each other but a good starting point for Bardenas Reales! the places are well materialized and it allows to visit the city. you must arrive not too late at the risk of not having room.
16443,2405649,3,stanlg,26/09/2022,"Parking at the edge of a cliff which contains old cave houses (to visit!). Unfortunately the machine for filling the water was broken and there was no toilet. As for the mosquitoes, they are out at nightfall. Either very convenient near Bardenas."

Try to look elsewhere maybe ...."
16443,2347202,3,lindalemon94,07/09/2022,Good spot for one evening/ Night. You can walk to the caves and to the quiet village. There are also grocery shopping opportuities. But you can theoretically sleep in the desert too if you do not want to stand with 50 other campers. Lots of dog poo around the place.

16443,2288772,4,michilbr,23/08/2022,Great starting point for the round trip in Las Bardenas Reales. Standing in front of the village caves for free for 48 hours is great! Place very well leveled. Next door at the adjoining cemetery are more places. Disposal works great. Fresh water cannot be refilled because the token mechanism is broken.
16443,2287889,2,marcangouleme,23/08/2022,"2 stars only because of the lack of maintenance of the service area. Already to have water you have to get tokens from the merchants, but the coin mechanism has been removed, which is not practical, and like everywhere, if lack of maintenance then it quickly becomes dirty. Attacked by mosquitoes in the evening, there are rice fields nearby. Good starting point for the Bardenas Desert"

16443,2229881,4,febronio,13/08/2022,"Very nice location, 4 stars really for the view, the magical place and the services, with electricity it would have been 5 stars, and yes unfortunately very unpleasant due to the mosquito there are really a lot."
16443,2228335,4,MartaPrada,13/08/2022,"Perfect quiet area to visit the Bardenas Reales. Emptying service but the rest of the services do not work. Yes, a lot of mosquitoes."
16443,2225715,3,bonheursolunatimote,12/08/2022,"it remains a group of motorhomes and vans. very practical for visiting the bardenas desert, however you have to arrive to stay at 6 p.m. or even 7 p.m. otherwise there is no more space. Tap at the entrance to the cemetery. nice view of the troglodyte houses."
16443,2224820,4,Leende,12/08/2022,"Location wise 5 stars! Beautifully situated under the cave houses. Free cp close to village, 5 km from info center Semi-Woestijn.Great disadvantage the mosquito infestation at twilight"
16443,2210258,4,benou64,10/08/2022,"Near the very friendly village, flat and nice parking for free. Beware of mosquitoes and cow odors (farms nearby). Prime location to discover the bardenas or go to the senda vida amusement park"
16443,2200932,2,GVLM,09/08/2022,"Perfect location during the day because near the bardenas desert and visit the troglodyte houses. A sublime sunset and very pleasant premises but flee before dark because we stayed there for 10m, the time to pack up and we had dozens of mosquito bites despite repellent on the skin and candles. Didn't have time to test the services except for emptying gray water."
16443,2185824,3,nico1444200,06/08/2022,Convenient to be steps from the desert. Drainage and water nearby… however noisy at night and virulent mosquito I still distribute them throughout Spain…
16443,2176935,3,Floriflora,05/08/2022,"nothing more to say than the existing comments... nauseating smell and mosquitoes galore, only positive point there is the water in the cemetery and the troglodyte houses to see and not far from the desert"
16443,2170532,4,willioux50,03/08/2022,Parking near the information center and the departure point for the walk in the Bardenas desert. View of troglodyte houses (illuminated at night in a magnificent color). Only drawback the impossibility of recharging to use the service terminal because by possible token purchase.
16443,2170344,4,amilpin080,03/08/2022,"Watch out for mosquitoes at dusk, there are many. The area fills up in early August. The cave houses next door are cool. Municipal pool nearby to cool off from the heat wave. Ideal to go to the Bardenas Reales and Sendaviva. I believe that the water is not free, tomorrow I will check it."
16443,2166574,3,Benanne35,03/08/2022,"Well placed to visit the park of bardenas, on the other hand we were attacked by mosquitoes: appalling! (there are rice fields near the village)"
16443,2164115,3,MoniRoterBus,02/08/2022,We couldn't find the water and when we wanted to fill our kettle (1 liter) in the cemetery there was trouble. The place was very crowded and it was loud for a long time. A lot of mosquitoes and our neighbor disposed of the gray water in the bushes. For a night in front of the semi-desert ok nothing more really has to be.
16443,2162676,4,ChristopheG.,02/08/2022,Parking lot with a lot of wind. Formerly inhabited caves to visit. The town is small but nice to walk around in the evening.
16443,2145624,4,JohanVisser,30/07/2022,It was a great location. We spent the night there with 30 campers and no one was bothered by stench or mosquitoes. It was clean and fine.

A water service point. Micro convenience store 400m away which has the merit of existing and having the necessary products."

16443,2123665,2,Thierrysmj33,25/07/2022,A little shaded car park… the services are a little far from the car park. Troglodyte houses just above but a little abandoned Near the start of the desert we stayed only one night and were very hot
16443,2123312,3,kikilloatk,25/07/2022,"If you want mosquitoes and the smell of pisuuu this is the ideal area, I have not seen more mosquitoes at dusk in my life, we had to leave at 10:00 p.m. the mosquitoes ate us!"
16443,2114793,4,FredVal35,24/07/2022,Close to Badernas so well located. Plenty of pitch but very popular. Very nice view Disadvantages: unpleasant smells and mosquitoes at sunset in large numbers.
16443,2105997,4,thometlaeti,22/07/2022,"Very nice view of the troglodyte houses and next to the start of the hike. Shaded place 5 minutes from the village and its mini-market (no running possible in the early afternoon because it does not open until 5.30 p.m.). For a free place, it's very good: the place of emptying and drinking water is only 50m from the pitch. Only downside, no public toilet nearby."
16443,2097558,1,gioia51,20/07/2022,"Excellent free parking AA, we did not spend the night there, only passing through the services, at the moment, that we arrived there were the beauty of 43 degrees which made us give up, there was no one around. In another period certainly excellent position for excursions. Recommended"

Two only problems, we couldn't sleep very well because of the mosquitoes and the operators started talking and cutting the weeds with the machines from 8 o'clock."

16443,2018011,4,Andjoc,28/06/2022,"We only went to the site to visit the troglodytes and do the oil changes and fill up the tank and do some shopping. we went to spend the night in Valtierra, too many people on the area for us. But thanks to the municipality"
16443,2014930,4,SylviaNowakowitsch,27/06/2022,"Many thanks to the place. A nice place, we slept well and had a delicious meal in town. The chirping of birds put us to sleep and woke us up gently. Unfortunately we could not take in fresh water. Gladly again."
16443,2001944,4,ramon67,22/06/2022,"we popped in but didn't stay the night. The forest fires did some damage to the bridge that leads to the information center... which was closed between 2 and 4 p.m., so between the fires and the lack of information we preferred to postpone our visit to Bardenas to another time..."
16443,1996791,5,Totokar1,21/06/2022,"Large area at the foot of the troglodyte houses which can be visited. 15 minutes walk from the center of the village where there are bars, restaurants and various shops. Very convenient for visiting the Bardenas."

16443,1980794,4,SylvianeJULIEN,15/06/2022,"good. near Bardenas. view of the caves. drain ok. if you need a little water, there is a water point in the cemetery. bad point: no shade. last night a cc had taken 4 of the most shaded places by getting across and moreover drained its CC directly on the pitches, while draining at 20 meters: what a shame. thanks to the city."
16443,1971083,4,micky57,12/06/2022,"I confirm the previous opinions, good location for the bardenas desert. nice location in front of the caves and close to the village, but no shade. we did not use the services. Thank you to the municipality for this free area"
16443,1969457,4,kiki3103,12/06/2022,Thanks to the municipality ideal place to do the Bardenas desert as well as the troglodytes
16443,1961986,4,arual.tv,09/06/2022,"Good for one night, not really cozy because of a busy parking lot. Plus, a toilet would be nice. It is worth visiting Cuevas"
16443,1958600,4,kazimoto,08/06/2022,"Area very well located for walking in the Bardenas. We stayed there for 3 nights. If the area for emptying gray water black water is operational, we could not fill up with water. The cleanliness is not the best, but given the number of camper vans in this area and the fact that it is free, thanks to the municipality of Argondas, the fact remains that motorhome operators should be more respectful of the place."
16443,1950003,5,odilesandre,05/06/2022,extraordinary this free area at the gates of the bardenas desert excellent location of course mosquitoes fly but it's the countryside Friday evening a few young people come just go out and demand silence put everything in order if you want to visit choose an excellent guide Javier
16443,1941515,5,manelpm,03/06/2022,"Quiet and safe, near the natural park of the Bardenas Reales, the town of Arguedas nearby. The worst flies and mosquitoes."
16443,1937491,3,yjanin,01/06/2022,"Yes for the smell, the mosquitoes and the flies, but that at least has the merit of existing especially close to Bardenas!"
16443,1929498,5,sachatromp,29/05/2022,"Loved this place! way better than the field right next to it... the ground was very level. a lot of people were complaining about a bad smell, but I didn't notice any? some spots have shade in the mornings. 
great place if you are going to visit the national park!"
16443,1929345,4,marycath,29/05/2022,"beautiful campsite, free. in a quiet area, directly under the troglodytes!!! Camper services are located across the street. it is indicated that the tokens for the water are available at the merchants of the city. No foul smell during our visit. For a free place, that's great! a thank you to the city that allows it!"
16443,1921810,4,TonyBUK,27/05/2022,The Aire is a marked parking area below the cave houses. the large meadow full of vans is far more than are supposed to stay and might lead to issues. The toilet flush and drive over drain are ok. Fresh water cannot be dispensed as the token slot is missing. Bring water if staying and DO NOT dump waste water on the ground as we saw being done in the meadow or it will get closed off.
16443,1918901,4,EricDuplouy,26/05/2022,"Despite the criticisms, I put 4 stars because the village allows us to land right in front of the caves. The air provided at the parking lot is clean, it is true if you take the land before it is limited. Yes no filling and other but finally for once the motorhomes are accepted with open arms. Sincerely, Eric"
16443,1907598,3,estelle.nadine,22/05/2022,"I confirm for flies, mosquitoes and odors. Still no water to fill the tank. Gray water and black water drains with cassette washing available."
16443,1904654,3,Quinou,21/05/2022,Nice place to spend a night under the troglodyte houses. Water terminal and drain on the other side of the road and supermarket 300m away. But lots of people. We were in our early 30s.
16443,1892104,5,Yejo88,15/05/2022,"all great and with stunning views. the town is next door to be able to buy in stores. people with other AC, campers...etc hyper nice."
16443,1883776,4,maxmo,11/05/2022,"very good for visiting the Bardenas desert, the departure is from the area, it is very practical. In addition, the troglodyte houses are a curiosity to see, they are illuminated at night."
16443,1879209,3,FerdiVan21,09/05/2022,A really big place and a good starting point for the Natural Park Bardenas Reales. There were very many campers on this site. Very good opportunities to walk with the dog. The nature park is ok.
16443,1877496,3,mogette,08/05/2022,"A rather pleasant area with a view of old troglodyte dwellings. Friends hikers, the area is not great. There is a hike of about 6 km starting from the area well in its first third and then zero. We then did a 10 km hike in the Bardenas desert but obviously the sector is more made to be traveled by car or bicycle."
16443,1858640,3,baboo,28/04/2022,"The air is calm, a bit tight in the number of places, and the view of the troglodyte houses is very nice, but the worst thing is that some motorhome owners allow them to empty their gray water on site once night has fallen so as not to to be seen (really disgusting!!!!) what a great reputation for the French!!!!"
16443,1856368,4,Bertrand9258,27/04/2022,"Beware of the meadow: proven risk of puncture. Luckily very friendly Taller Floristán gas station and mechanic. Instead, go to a landscaped area. Bakery and convenience store nearby and good. Thanks to the community."
16443,1854105,4,chevris,26/04/2022,"beautiful area for motorhomes, 6 km from the Bardenas desert, plenty of room with a meadow on the other side of the cemetery and the filling emptying area on the other side of the road"
16443,1853782,4,Ch59,26/04/2022,"Free area well located Drains without problem. Quiet except in the parking lot next to the trucks at 8 am. Close to the superb Bardenas desert, especially around the military zone. To recommend"

16443,1849983,5,ivoderooij,24/04/2022,"We just stood here next to the motorhome in the grass. Nice place, nice and quiet."
16443,1840856,5,diegobianchi,20/04/2022,"Very suggestive Spartan area, at night, the cliff is illuminated with multicolored lights. Ideal for visiting the Bardenas, with a route also by camper, on dirt roads of 35 km, very picturesque."
16443,1835587,3,Aitororueta,18/04/2022,"Good location, close to the town to walk. The site is very beautiful, next to the cave houses. There are no toilets nearby. When we went, the filling and electric charging system for motorhomes did not work."
16443,1831598,1,taillonnais17,17/04/2022,"I disagree with josegalan. today like yesterday (and this is not the first time that this has happened) we can only empty our gray water. you can't empty your toilet cassette (the hatch is blocked and condemned. The coin mechanism has been removed or torn off, so it's impossible to fill up with clean water. In addition, the place is in a terrible state."
16443,1830476,5,josegalan21,17/04/2022,Very quiet and spacious site. It has all the services and is full of vans and motorhomes
16443,1822621,5,bobbyhome,14/04/2022,Very pretty area facing the cave. Very clean and quiet parking lot we spent a peaceful night.
16443,1819246,4,etienne,13/04/2022,Another peaceful night. Lots of ccar on the area and even on the parking lot next door. A big thank you to the municipality for your welcome.

16443,1814051,3,le-vallerot,10/04/2022,"Quiet area with a beautiful view of the troglodyte houses, illuminated in the evening. If the area is complete there is partly landscaped land nearby, allowing the parking of many motorhomes. Emptying and filling possible thanks to a token to be taken in the shops. no electricity The Bardenas desert is about 10km away. a few shops in the village, grocery store, bread"
16443,1806268,4,turtle19,04/04/2022,"thank you to the municipality for this motorhome area, close to everything, with a small bakery with very good products, at the foot of the caves, hiking trail and not far from the Bardenas desert. Too bad some dog owners don't pick up the feces."
16443,1804623,3,hilger,03/04/2022,"The place at the rock caves is fine. We were on the meadow square by the way. Unfortunately, today was a bike race and we were totally parked up, the Spaniards don't care that you want to drive away."
16443,1798938,5,JAS21ONTOUR,28/03/2022,Very interesting to visit and learn about the cave houses.  Spent a very quiet Sunday night and would return.
16443,1795824,4,ljp24,26/03/2022,Very quiet area with a beautiful view of the troglodyte houses and a stone's throw from the Bardenas desert if the area is complete between the cemetery and the vegetable packaging factory you can settle in without any problem we spent 2 nights there (watch out for the spikes which hang around in places) we did not puncture thanks to the municipality
16443,1794594,5,varkaleta,25/03/2022,Very good place to rest with good views. We had a very quiet night.
16443,1791003,5,Dan-el,21/03/2022,"Nice place, with views of the houses carved into the stone. Fairly level plots and water and drainage services. Thanks to the council!"
16443,1788990,5,baptistereee,20/03/2022,Very good location next to the Bardenas. Drain and water at 50 m.
16443,1788456,5,janarpru,19/03/2022,"Great place, loads of campers and felt safe. Close to the natural park. Town was cute too. We stayed one night but definitely a place we’d come back."
16443,1788444,5,ranger88,19/03/2022,Super relaxed night! Caves are awesome and easy to get to. A trip to Las Bardenas Reales is highly recommended. You can drive there directly on gravel roads.
16443,1787908,5,femke22,19/03/2022,Fantastic place! Large parking lot with fairly straight spots. From the motorhome you can easily walk to the supermarket. Among the caves that are beautifully lit in the evening. Had a quiet night in a beautiful place. From this motorhome you can drive to the information center of the park in 10 minutes. Recommended!
16443,1786693,5,mfb52.,18/03/2022,"very good, emptying, water, what could be better, a large free car park at the foot of the caves and close to the shops, the Bardenas nearby"
16443,1786403,5,vinz_the_camper,18/03/2022,Quiet place with basic amenities. unfortunately the water filling is not working at the moment because the unit where you have to put the coins in is gone. Possibility to discharge chemical toilet and gray water.
16443,1783142,5,YvanTrivino,14/03/2022,"at the foot of the caves, flat and ideally placed"
16443,1781909,4,EmandJames88,13/03/2022,"Amazing park up under the caves! Make sure you have a look around them-they’re lit up at night too. We didn’t need facilities but they are as described, no toilets around at all though you need to be self contained - there is a toilet at info centre 10 mins drive towards desert tho. Shop is 5 min walk, bars in town 10 mins. Great cycle routes v near by and the desert is spectacular. Quite popular."
16443,1779394,4,edenmahdi,10/03/2022,good place at the foot of the troglodyte caves at the door of the bardenas desert drain area 50 m before on the left no water coin operated broken damage
16443,1773057,4,jubelle31,04/03/2022,02/24/22. Stop just to empty the water. Free (except plenty of water €2) and efficient but dirty environment. For those who complain about the smell.. the fault of the consumers who continue to eat pork piled up in the barracks nearby
16443,1773056,4,cricri84260,04/03/2022,Reading the comments I realize that many have not found the emptying of gray water and cassettes. 50 m on the left of the street when you have the caves behind you. I add a photo.
16443,1772553,5,petboarder,03/03/2022,"Simple parking space in the best location. I can't say anything about supply and disposal, we didn't need it. Sight and place with bars and restaurants right next door. You can't expect more for a free seat, you don't need more."
16443,1769817,5,harleyjoe321,01/03/2022,Everything you need! We felt very good and will definitely come back again
16443,1768075,4,JoneFernandez,27/02/2022,"Good area, near the town, a lot of movement of motorhomes and vans. Poster with the rules and as always some foreigners taking out tables and chairs. Otherwise well."
16443,1765150,4,DaviddeTudela,25/02/2022,A large area with all the services (although we have not used them because they are paid). The place is nice and next to the bardenas.
16443,1759460,5,SaRon110819,18/02/2022,Very nice and quiet parking space. From here it is only 10 minutes to the Bardenas Reales Natural Park. We spent two nights here and felt very comfortable.
16443,1758022,5,xunpugnodieuro,17/02/2022,"Quiet place, crowded even in mid-February. No service, only the drain (no water except the fountain of the neighboring cemetery). Quiet and peaceful at night. The one small grocery store was closed. Ideal if you visit bardenas reales."
16443,1756454,4,Lagalik,15/02/2022,Very quiet parking at the foot of the troglodyte houses. The terminal to empty its gray and black water is located just at the exit of the car park
16443,1756077,4,Boults,14/02/2022,"Great location as said by loads of others. Warning though, the water supply is still not fixed, so make sure you have 2 days worth when you arrive, or do like us and just drink wine :). The guy in the shop was really honest about it when we tried to buy tokens. If you are doing the Bardenas Reales it’s amazing and the lady in the information centre was super helpful and lovely with it."
16443,1755840,3,Gopvan,14/02/2022,"We have spent a very quiet and pleasant night. Of course, we arrived at 10:00 p.m. and it was almost complete."
16443,1755117,4,maxikangooGG,13/02/2022,"Great spot but there is a not very pleasant smell, we don't know where it comes from. It's free."
16443,1754705,5,Mofli2020,13/02/2022,"A beautiful site under the caves of Arguedas and very close to the Bardenas, it is worth spending the night, well leveled, quiet and very relaxing walks."
16443,1753439,4,Jorg3Arancon,12/02/2022,"The area is very well situated, just below the caves, which are lit up at night, and opposite a promenade with exercise machines. There is a supermarket very close, to fill the water you have to go to the shops and buy a €2 token, I lower it one star because it does NOT work, it is broken and unfixed, you cannot fill water, the rest is ok"
16443,1751854,5,yboisseau,10/02/2022,"Superb locations. Even for very long vehicles. Very quiet at night. Very close to Bardenas Park. Drain gray and black water. Bins on site. On the other hand, the timer is broken, so no clean water available (just the rinsing of the cassette). In short, a nice place to spend the night out of season (the area must be saturated in season)."
16443,1748374,4,THLX,05/02/2022,"A convenient stopover next to the village. Services available, but the main interest is that this stop is at the gates of the Bardenas Reales which can be visited from sunrise. Still, this area is more and more frequented, at the same time two years ago we were 3 CC, this year around 20."
16443,1742608,3,remicaquelard,28/01/2022,"Contrary to some opinions, the places are long enough for a motorhome and a well-defined trailer (12m). There are bins, nice place for emptying (black and gray) token to take in the village. very clean place. Beautiful walks to do. the caves are lit at night. A big thank you to the municipality because very few places like this in Spain."
16443,1738672,5,4Vanderlust,22/01/2022,"01/19: Perfect, very quiet with only locals walking by. Very good parking to then visit the Bardenas. For the black/grey water and filling services, this is along the small road that you take just before entering the car park (not easy to see at the start)"
16443,1732952,4,Brilisad,12/01/2022,"This time we were able to find a place, they are small, but they exist, it's great. Mud in some places. Gray and black drains possible but no water for filling because the device was for the tokens was defective. Good starting point for the Bardenas."
16443,1732613,3,rochmans,12/01/2022,very beautifull place to park but no water to refill. the water machine was broken.
16443,1730625,4,Ramoni_Mclouis,09/01/2022,"A quiet area that is usually occupied quickly with limited places and an overnight stay limited to 48 hours. Quiet and nearby there is a supermarket. Taking a walk you can visit the towns and have a drink. It has gray and black water drains. It is a shame that there are still people who do not know how to comply with the parking regulations, FORBIDDEN TO REMOVE CHAIRS AND TABLES, then we pay just for sinners. We will return for sure"
16443,1730519,3,jensTT,09/01/2022,"Good place to spend the night before visiting ""Las Bardenas"". It fills up quickly in the afternoon and some campers choose to park in the car-only area next to the cemetery. If it is full, there is a large open space next to it where you can park, but avoid the squares next to the cemetery so as not to disturb and respect the neighbors who have so kindly made this stop."
16443,1728228,3,santi60,06/01/2022,"Area that meets expectations, quiet and well defined plots, without electricity connection near town."
16443,1724484,5,ninick68,03/01/2022,This area is free in a beautiful setting with free emptying and the possibility of buying tokens in shops to fill up with water. So let's stop criticizing as I have seen in other comments!
16443,1720825,4,GladJuvan,31/12/2021,"Very good spot but the unpleasant smell comes quite simply from the campsites because they empty their dirty water in the parking lot. We stayed there for two nights, a motorhome emptied its water and the other night someone came emptying its chemical toilet behind our van. people do not respect anything! knowing that at 50m there is enough to empty it. it's a shame but the spot remains good."
16443,1717859,4,lruiz,28/12/2021,"very good for 2 nights, close to the dessert of Bardenas. at the moment there is no water, gray and black water is good."
16443,1711764,3,OrenKipnis,18/12/2021,"The parking space is very nice and calm, however the service point is out of order snd one csn not fill water or chargr yhr batteries."
16443,1703477,4,Leonhymer,05/12/2021,Almost level. Very calm and nice seen. Highly coveted
16443,1701675,4,NATH79,02/12/2021,Nice delimilite parking lot. Water and drain services 100 meters away. Magnificent view of the illuminated cliffs. Great place to visit the Bardenas.
16443,1694569,5,Mirisanta,21/11/2021,"The area is fine. next door there is a kind of park with exercise machines, which the children have loved. It is close to three types of mountain bike routes. the town is fine, just enough to have a drink and buy bread. We will return better prepared for the bike routes !!"
16443,1693404,4,MitMichel,19/11/2021,"Quiet, beautifully located on the rock face that is illuminated at night, in close proximity to the Bardenas Nature Park, but even now almost fully occupied"
16443,1689541,5,Sunka37,15/11/2021,Perfect for visiting the desert
16443,1687070,4,Van33SMJ,13/11/2021,2 nights without any problem. very quiet and at the foot of the troglodytes that can be visited for free. The service area is a little before the car park on the left. Token terminal.
16443,1685694,4,caphimat,11/11/2021,"Very pleasant area at the foot of the troglodytes, and close to the main entrance to the desert. No services, but very clean, and free."
16443,1681716,4,HughBasant,07/11/2021,"Perfect for spending the night, the entrance to the desert is about 500m away and the town has a supermarket, nearby there is a gas station where you can serve yourself (it is oculomica). You can discharge sewage and it has a tap with water"
16443,1680271,3,DomJbus,06/11/2021,"For one night it's fine, impressive troglodytes above! Not used the services. Lots of mosquitoes around even at the end of October. Well placed for departure to Bardenas, but be aware that if it has rained or is going to rain (and there it was 2), access to the desert is strongly discouraged. Check the weather if you don't want to make the trip for nothing"
16443,1678884,4,Rapido8086,05/11/2021,"Rapido8086 Hello, I confirm that this morning I used the new manhole for emptying the cassettes in the presence of the employees of the municipality, very easy to access."
16443,1675958,3,Chcol89,03/11/2021,"Nice space to spend the night, quickly filled but many possibilities around. A good ""Mallen"" restaurant in the city center, beautiful night lighting of the troglodytes just behind. The service area is in the street a little further but we can no longer put tokens so no water. We can empty and this morning a municipal team is on site to repair the toilet drain which is broken."
16443,1675534,3,vanlife83270,03/11/2021,"Convenient for visiting the Bardenas, parking quickly full so you can park on the cemetery side on a wasteland that is not very clean and close to a factory so a little noisy even at night. But overall for one night it's fine."
16443,1667426,4,Katzentour,29/10/2021,"If you travel self-sufficient, there is nothing to complain about! We had a great time here!"
16443,1665767,3,shirleylou,28/10/2021,Perfect for the night but be careful not to empty the toilet box because poo everywhere and it is clogged… Quiet night and caves to visit
16443,1664103,4,lameule33,27/10/2021,"Very large parking, unfortunately, no more electricity because the coin mechanism was ransacked!"
16443,1654984,5,bumblebeeHH,21/10/2021,"Very good free parking space to drive to the bardenas reales in the morning. Coming in time secures a place. Very busy in the evening. Free sewage and garbage disposal. There is another large parking lot right next door, if it is full."
16443,1649400,4,marchoso,17/10/2021,"Highly recommended area in front of the Arguedas Caves. Formed by two parts to spend the night, one with services that are paid by acquiring tokens in the stores, and the other to the right and in front of the cemetery, which is completely free and from where you can also see the caves. Quiet and recommended place to spend the night and a starting point to visit the caves and the Bardenas."
16443,1647944,4,R.a.,16/10/2021,"Super place to explore the bardenas, but many campers on the motorhome. Nice view!"
16443,1642376,3,mig85.mm@gmail.com,13/10/2021,"Too bad the token system is broken so it is impossible to take drinking water for emptying the toilets it is blocked its flow everywhere on the ground, positive point the parking is under surveillance."
16443,1637474,4,oldman65xxl,10/10/2021,"There would be five stars for sensible disposal. No drinking water, dirty toilet disposal. However, there is a tap in the cemetery for small quantities. The cave dwellings are brightly lit at night. The square is the ideal starting point for visiting the Bardenas Reales."
16443,1633114,5,viajererosenfamilia,08/10/2021,"We loved this place, we spent one night, very quiet overlooking the caves. I would recommend it 100% for any traveler who wants to visit the bardenas, make routes, visit the living path or who is caught passing through"
16443,1632878,3,frascho,08/10/2021,"Top spot! To visit the rock dwellings us as a starting point for the tour through the semi-desert Bardenas Reales. Although narrow and usually very crowded towards the evening, there is a huge wasteland a few meters away, there are usually a few Womos. If only it weren't for the disposal, dirty, full of faeces and without function, what a shame."
16443,1628087,5,mercheandthevaiven,05/10/2021,"Good area to spend the night at the gates of the cemetery. If you follow the side walk you can go to the town where you will find bakeries, bars ... the upper part is a neighborhood walk area and they were all very friendly."
16443,1618587,3,jaja69,30/09/2021,"Well located at the foot of the caves and 5km from the main entrance to the Bardenas desert. The motorhome area itself is not very large and the spaces are quite narrow, but it is possible to park on the other side of the cemetery just nearby. On the other hand, the water and electricity charging station does not work, it is just possible to empty the waste water."
16443,1612820,4,CalViudo,27/09/2021,"Perfect area to spend the night before or after visiting the Bardenas Reales. The seats are wide and access, if you pay attention to the GPS, is complicated. Tip: Follow the signposts and not the GPS. In summer it is usually very full and is complemented by the cemetery car park, where many more vehicles fit. It has no shadow and the previous comment that talks about the amount of flies, is true."
16443,1611095,5,sonrisusan,26/09/2021,"Aupa! We spent 2021-09-17 / 18 nights, but not in the area, in a large parking lot next door, and we were about 40. It has no service, but the caves are visible. The worst tiger mosquitoes ... how many grains, and this itch ... 20 minutes from SendaViva! And near the Bardenas!"
16443,1609907,3,monomanandfamily,26/09/2021,Pros: Very good views of the troglodyte caves. Large pitches. Cons: a lot of flies but a lot !!! Griffin inside the cemetery.
16443,1606365,4,ThomasEmmerich,25/09/2021,"The description of the place is correct, supply is okay. Unfortunately, fresh water is defective."
16443,1604566,3,laura-volker,24/09/2021,"Very well frequented parking space. But very quietly. In fact, it smells a little unpleasant. We did not use services - so no comment on them. Very well located to visit the Bardenas Reals the next day"
16443,1602626,5,Anamallegue,23/09/2021,"Beautiful place near the Bardenas Desert. The services ok, the water filling with 1 jeton, the machine is broken (09/15/21), we went to the town gas station to fill up. 100% recommendable!"
16443,1598671,5,caporal,22/09/2021,"At the foot of the cliffs and the troglodyte illuminated at night, calm, almost level, near the city center, service area 100 meters away."
16443,1593423,4,cuquivanlua,20/09/2021,"Well located to reach the royal Bardenas. all careful. We went yesterday Saturday, and it was full, although in a wide esplanade next door it was possible to park, without exaggeration there were more than 50 camper / motorhomes. Pretty close bakery, great croissants"
16443,1586000,4,mariepierrel,17/09/2021,Area very well located to visit the desert of the bardenas. Don't arrive too late to get a seat. Quiet in the evening. village next door with inexpensive restaurant. To advice
16443,1578657,3,chejl,14/09/2021,Nice well located
16443,1571350,4,margootje,12/09/2021,Great spot quiet and free! There are plenty of eating and drinking opportunities in the town at a 10 min walk. Perfect for visiting Bardenas Reales nearby.
16443,1565390,4,leparadisencampingcar,10/09/2021,"Indeed odors due to the presence of many farms around. But this is the countryside. It is a simple parking lot with the possibility of emptying (euro terminal a little further). Garbage cans available. Grocery store 200m away. 6 km from the circuit in the desert (to do absolutely, without any particular difficulty by bike, a little chaotic road of 34 km). About fifteen places. Quickly fill"
16443,1555279,4,Paquimaat,07/09/2021,"Great area to spend the night at the entrance of the park. We arrived on a Monday in September at 8pm and there were only 2 places left. Despite having many people, the night has been very calm and quiet."
16443,1551015,5,TaniaSerrano,05/09/2021,"Incredible place to spend the night and get closer the next day to bardenas reales which is 6 km away. We arrived around 20:00 and we were lucky to find a place because it was very full of traveling people. There are large squares and other smaller ones that are a bit fair, but still worth it. Water intake and water drainage. And without forgetting that you sleep under the Arguedas caves !!!"
16443,1545569,5,mirikol,04/09/2021,"Precious. Near the center where there are bars and restaurants, and the municipal swimming pools which are very good. little shade. super close"
16443,1529910,1,Macsea,30/08/2021,Within a minute the AC was full of mosquitoes. Just open the door to get in and out. I killed 10 mosquitoes inside the AC and went somewhere else. A shame.
16443,1525470,2,clemlst,28/08/2021,"Parking full fairly quickly. No shade so very hot in a desert region. Quite a few noises in the evening but it helps out because to visit Bardenas Reales there are not many places, quickly busy and wild camping almost impossible with the Guarda Civil patrolling"
16443,1492491,2,lauaguirre85,21/08/2021,"The beautiful views, but if you want to spend the night on fire prepare to die of heat now in August. I say this because with the amount of mosquitoes there are, it is impossible to sleep with the doors open, I have more than 100 bites"
16443,1489708,3,Ogay,21/08/2021,"As of 18-8-2021 the water and draining of blacks do not work. In the store they sell you they say neither that it is in disuse, nor that it is made a dunghill, they continue to pour sewage even though it does not swallow! just remembering it makes me vomit. ok to the positive comments regarding the parking area that is away from the non-service area about 200 m"
16443,1485673,4,Hugodani2010,20/08/2021,"The site is very good, it is beautiful and there are many cars, it is quite level but there is no shade, the town is also good, the cave houses are curious, if it fills 50 meters there is another dollar that people stay, they eat you the mosquitos."
16443,1485138,3,mingo-44,20/08/2021,"Very good for a night no shade. We were not able to empty the black water because the drainage blocked and overflowed. To refill with water, purchase a token at the bar next door."
16443,1484409,5,rubendejota,19/08/2021,"Area with water drainage service, although the filling system did not work. Very quiet and pleasant, the views of the caves spectacular."
16443,1483013,5,Gabyana,19/08/2021,Perfect to rest after a day of hiking
16443,1481677,3,Colchoneta,19/08/2021,"Free area under the caves (Beautiful lighting at night, which makes it cool to sleep). Free but with a light point and gray cast without conservation (very dirty!) And with previous payment of ""milestones"", some coins that are bought in the town's establishments."
16443,1480011,4,mirtheandfou,19/08/2021,Great spot for the night. Plenty of space when we arrived. A nice quiet town where you can enjoy a cold beer and use a toilet as there are no services on site.
16443,1475407,3,mitou24620,18/08/2021,Drain point not cleaned regularly .. I don't understand how people can be so dirty and not be careful…
16443,1474478,4,vanGRsun,18/08/2021,"Quiet for the night but quite quickly filled in the evening. This is located right next to a vacant lot that a few vans occupied, with better chocks."
16443,1471862,5,stellum,17/08/2021,"Great area, we stayed one night. It fills up right away, but we were lucky and we were able to spend the night. There is a bakery, greengrocer, butcher shop, ... still a kilometer from the area"

16443,1443784,5,EmeSarah,12/08/2021,We had a very good quiet night. There are just a few trees missing to protect us from the Sun very present in the early morning
16443,1436464,4,lilishan,10/08/2021,Very beautiful view ! We are in a converted van and there is no water or electricity on site and a lot of people ... It might be worth it to find another place but for one night it's OK.
16443,1426783,3,palombus47,09/08/2021,"Quiet night. Better to arrive not too late. For emptying and clear water (with tokens), the platform is located 50 meters before the car park."
16443,1423457,1,Davidmj3,08/08/2021,"Site without any shade, uncomfortable and you have to go a long way from the highway to get there. We didn't even stop, we decided it was better to find another place."
16443,1419712,4,annsoslvt,07/08/2021,"Small but shaded places, it is very pleasant, a lot of people, do not arrive too late. Magnificent tourist site, albeit dirty! Tokens for the service are not very convenient. Site to preserve!"
16443,1402516,4,Bolonio,04/08/2021,"A great place to spend the night. You have to arrive before 8 pm to have a place. There is no water, at gas stations you can recharge water for free if you refuel, if not € 3."
16443,1394826,4,Taurine,02/08/2021,"Good access, next to the marked and marked area for motorhome parking there is another large and open area where we slept, since the signposted one was full. The machine for loading electricity and water did not work, but we were able to discharge the two waters. He confirmed what he read out there that there were mosquitoes, and many, we had to kill inside the Camper before sleeping."
16443,1394289,3,derkeff,02/08/2021,The perfect starting point for the bardenas reales. There is a swimming pool in the village which we used for showering. Unfortunately there are no shady spots and the flies are a real nuisance. Unfortunately we couldn't find out where to get electricity and water.
16443,1392567,4,alvasan75,01/08/2021,"Quiet area next to the caves, near the town. Ground floor. Quite a few mosquitoes at night. We do not use the services that go with tokens that you have to ask for in the town"
16443,1391758,5,LeMarc666,01/08/2021,We had a very quiet night here in front of an impressive backdrop. Ideal to visit the Bardeñas Reales. It's great that the municipality is making a place like this available.
16443,1389193,5,KasperskyVan,01/08/2021,"Relevant fact THERE ARE MOSQUITOES at night high level! Very comfortable, to sleep without problem, quiet and beautiful place. It is full of vans and motorhomes, the ground is firm and made of stone with dirt, it gets a bit dirty. There is a place to walk around and a cemetery."
16443,1384960,4,yes_224,31/07/2021,"Nice gravel parking lot that fills up in the evening. It is in a good location because it is close to different things to do: bardenas desert, the municipal swimming pool of arguedas as well as the ""sendaviva"" amusement park Be careful no shade so it can be very hot."

16443,1363018,5,Anuskabelzu,25/07/2021,"Fantastic place to spend the day and night. Ideal to go with the bikes and get closer to the Parque de las Bardenas. Well defined plots, and separate area for Ac and camper vans. Area for dirty water and fountains. Remember, take a lot of water to make a complete tour of the Bardenas, which is very worthwhile. Entry hours from 8-20h, free."
16443,1357118,4,meduxask8,24/07/2021,Very quiet area in a pleasant environment. Very close to the town and with views of the caves.

16443,1340413,3,jiranzo,19/07/2021,Good area. The bad thing is that the clean water and sewage emptying services do not work. Municipal pool nearby. If it had all the services operational we could give it 5 stars

16443,1334637,4,Meadow,17/07/2021,"A very peculiar place. It gave us a feeling of security both day and night. The residents of the town are pleasant and friendly. The drinking water service did not work, the rest did. It is worth stopping at least one night."

16443,1318099,3,familiapardell.miret,12/07/2021,We spent a quiet night and in the morning we visited the caves before going to sendaviva. Too bad the water doesn't work.

16443,1290738,2,mimamuschl,02/07/2021,"2 stars because free but otherwise: You can look at the caves but a maximum of half an hour is enough. In the evening, a spot on the rock face is illuminated. Space offers no shade and at night you unfortunately don't have a good feeling of security (people walking through the parking lot at night). Great for an early starting point to the desert, but wouldn't go again."

16443,1108856,5,RollingStoned,29/10/2020,"2 days ago, before the air closed, we had a very good night! Very pleasant air, the municipal police came to tell us that the Navare has been confined since Sunday and that tourism is prohibited, that they are going to close the parking lot. So we spent the next night at Bardenas. We came back the next day to empty, the gray water no problem, the black water was clogged, the clear water was free though!"
16443,1107455,2,Quenrin2,27/10/2020,"The parking area is prohibited today by order of the police. Because of covid 19? For how long ? Nothing is mentioned. We have not tested the services. The parking lot next door is probably not available for the night either, a woman prowls around and takes pictures of the license plates of all the motorhomes. We are not welcome!"

16443,1084641,4,KikoSuarez,07/10/2020,"Quiet area and in the town. It is a quiet area, which has a supermarket 500 meters away and 10 minutes in the center of town with bars and restaurants. It is right on the entrance road to the bardenas. To fill with water and electricity, you have to buy some chips in the shops of the town."

The views of the caves are curious and it is a good place if you want to sleep accompanied by other vehicles since there are usually people staying overnight in the place. It has no water or toilets. Smells like goat quite a bit. Recommended for sleeping and little else.
16443,1043688,4,ApDent,12/09/2020,"Simple but ideal spot for visiting Bardenas Reales. It lacks shade so it can become quite hot.. fortunately the municipal swimmingpool is only 5 minutes away (euro 4,-)"
16443,1043347,4,DanArKemper,12/09/2020,"Good start for the Bardenas, at the foot of the troglodytes, different color lighting in the evening. Emptying requires a little maintenance."

There are no services, they are about 100 meters (they are paid). Planes are heard until 10pm more or less. The ground is dirt and quite dusty. Recommended for spending the night and visiting the park. Good views towards the caves."
16443,1037904,5,Timer,09/09/2020,Perfect for an overnight stay. It has a bar and a SPAR next to it and there is space for about 33 caravans. We arrived around 8pm and they were 40% busy.

16443,889213,4,Pimcakes,22/07/2020,2 very quiet nights in this car park for ccar. Access to Bardenas 6 kms. Very unusual site with the troglodyte dwellings just behind.

16443,790819,4,padraigl,04/03/2020,"This is a dirt/sandy underfoot Aire with 16 dedicated parking spaces divided by timbers on the ground. It can gets quite mucky in wet weather. The spaces are not level as they lean to one side and you will need chocks to level the motorhome. It's sandwiched between the cave houses, the cemetery and the town.
They are not suitable for really large motorhomes (bus type) or motorhomes with trailers. The maximum stay is 48 hours.

Pros:
Free parking.
Payed (token) fresh water and electricity point.
Free grey drain.
Free black WC drain.
Local small supermarkets, restaurant, cafes and bars. 
Bike and walking tracks.

Cons:
No shade.
Dirt/sandy underfoot.

There are full Euro-Realis services including an electric point on the service pillar located on the left side on the drive in, separate from the Aire with good signage. Tokens are got from the local shops.
Insert the token and press the relevant button 100 litres of  fresh water or 1 hour of electricity.
*We did not try the electric point so not sure if it's working. But the connection is not covered over.
**The fresh water was free when we were there in early March.

The grey drain has good flow direction into the center grate.

The black WC drain is on the right side of the service pillar at ground level under a plastic cover. The drain pipe is large but there is some splashback due to its location. The cassette push button tap on the opposite side of the pillar and has reduced pressure hence no splashback. 
**The drain was blocked when we went to empty the last day.

The fresh water tap is a medium screw-on connection with excellent pressure. The tap is a push button. 

There are 2 large bins in the carpark and 1 at the service area.

There are 2 small supermarkets and cafe/bars in the town. 
We completed a 3 hour circular hike around the Senda Viva wildlife park which is is in the Bardenas Reales.
There is plenty of trails and tracks for mountain biking or hiking.
On leaving we just emptied our grey as the black WC was blocked and we didn't need any fresh water.

We had 2 very quiet nights here with about 7 motorhomes.

Bugs/Mosquitoes. (They love us..)
We did not encounter any mosquitoes here at the beginning of March."

Lots of vans left by 10am so it seems the 48 hour rule is generally observed. Interesting place but unlikely to hold your attention too long unless the desert is of interest to you.  Some of the spaces on the right as you arrive are very narrow and look more like car spaces."

16443,727910,5,LaeLaeLa,23/10/2019,Very close to the Bardenas. We spent 2 nights here. Visit houses dug in the rock of day and also at night with the electric lamp. The children were delighted. How lucky to be able to access this place with free water and emptying.
16443,726593,5,Pierrot38110,21/10/2019,We spent a lovely quiet night near the desert of Bardenas. Free service
16443,726158,4,ralphss8,20/10/2019,Nice place to stop. Caves are worth a visit. The spaces marked at the right hand end are way too small and impractical for anything bigger than a camper van. Spaces facing the road are OK though. Was very busy in mid September and some vans left to use the alternative parking on the other side of the cemetery which is pretty rough. didn't use the services so I can't comment.
16443,723118,4,2205,16/10/2019,"Very nice area of c.car, all shops nearby."
16443,717722,4,lukasundalina,10/10/2019,"If you are here, you should definitely visit the residences in the rocks. Until the 60s, these were inhabited as affordable apartments. In some you can even find the decor and kitchen! - At the service station you unfortunately get no drinking water, otherwise a good place to visit the national park."
16443,715313,4,frck,07/10/2019,"Free service, water and emptying. small flat for users who do not respect the service at their disposal, the drain WC was out of service on our way, thank you to them."
16443,714605,5,Esterel31LD,06/10/2019,"Thank you to the municipality for creating this camping car area. water and emptying at our disposal. Calm and close to shops. Bakery and grocery store. Very good restaurant at the exit of the city 52 paseo de la Ribera ""HERMANI"" with a menu at 16 EUROS excellent, good reception. We did the circuit of Bardenas by motorbike (34km), very well, we will return."
16443,714575,5,Masseix,06/10/2019,Everything is said or almost. On water terminal it is noted unsafe water.
16443,709992,4,Baillette,01/10/2019,"Very good for the night. Services ok. No mosquitoes for us today. We did the circuit of Bardenas motorhome, it still shakes a lot."
16443,705696,5,aillet56,27/09/2019,"Base for a 34 km circuit in the Bardenas (Spanish Monument Valley ...). Beautiful free area under the Cuevas, old illuminated troglodyte dwellings. Very busy place, do not arrive late. Nearby town center and the information center of Bardenas Reales a few kilometers."
16443,703986,5,Sissi22,25/09/2019,"Apart from a few mosquitos in the evening, beautiful suite with the illuminations in the evening. We did the Bardenas desert on a dirt bike, great."
16443,697677,4,jph64,20/09/2019,"Everything has already been said. Beautiful site. Just mosquitoes, plan what you need and especially, arrive early, places are expensive. We took a token at 2 € but for nothing, free water, no problem. I recommend."
16443,696434,5,Magellan6665,19/09/2019,"Nice location, but no service, village nearby."
16443,695768,5,Archelon5,18/09/2019,"It is a breeding region so flies and smells but that's the countryside. The area is perfect to prepare the visit of the Bardenas. On foot, the troglodyte dwellings above are to be seen. Then two options for the desert: a guide and his 4x4 that takes you from the area for 3 hours and a half. It's 40 € per person; where to go to the information house at 5 kilometers from the area which will indicate you the circuit of 35 Kilometers drivable and quite feasible in camper; privilege the turn to the right when you are facing the military field; plan the day and do not rush to land at noon, places clear with sublime views are not lacking. To go to the information house, you go to the blue bollard and go straight on."
16443,694803,3,LVX655DR,17/09/2019,"Area bordering the Bardenas, clean, free water. The station to empty is before entering the area, in front of the cemetery. No need to go to the tourist office of the locality to have doc on the Bardenas, there is none! you have to go to the information center at the entrance of the Bardenas, about 6kms after the area. The Bardenas deserve to be seen"
16443,686779,5,dominikkutrowski,12/09/2019,"Nice place. We spent one night there with our normal combi in transit. It was pretty crowded in September, so we had to place ourselves on the left along the wall. But was not a problem for anyone."
16443,685262,4,Bins79,10/09/2019,"Area with all services. Considering the previous comments, I was not very excited. Tonight big wind so no mosquitoes, no smell, a quiet night. Perfect for the Bardenas, starting from the interpretation center, the central loop with return to the center is 34 km. Easily feasible by camper, good track to make preferably in the right-hand direction never if rain."
16443,674352,2,flocamcar,03/09/2019,"Aire not bad if operational service and attention to the nightlife of the Spanish, they put themselves in the square until late at night. 2h and it's the life of patachons"
16443,669601,2,Dom974,31/08/2019,"That night, I left a skylight open this morning around 6.30 am an invasion of mosquitoes in the motorhome"
16443,669175,3,Dom974,30/08/2019,"Clean area but beware, there is a bull breeding and there can be smells nothing too bad to compare with the invasion of mosquitoes, there are everywhere"
16443,666425,4,danisa62,29/08/2019,"Superb area, not far from the desert Bardenas. I refueled just before entering the site at 1.15"
16443,665776,2,Mijina,29/08/2019,"The site is very beautiful, but everything said is true, there are many mosquitoes, bad smell, overcrowding, it can be filled without paying, but the emptying of sewage is clogged and disgusting. Very close to Bardenas Reales in case you come back to visit them or go the next morning. We have not fallen asleep, we have only emptied gray and filled."
16443,665529,2,hinala,28/08/2019,Very close to real bardenas. Quiet place but with a lot of occupation. We have not fallen asleep because it is full of mosquitoes.

16443,665141,3,iswanda83,28/08/2019,"In spite of the comments of the people, we do the filling of water without paying, but it is true that it has no emptying area. It is a super quiet and beautiful place, yes, crowded, but still we had no problems. We were told that if it was filled there was another area where overnight stay is allowed on top of it, where there is a hermitage."
16443,659002,3,calif72,25/08/2019,"Very good for a break, moustiquessssssss but it's a shame! To be taking water in the cemetery because the service area is foul! Room, not maintained. People empty toilets anywhere and anyhow yet here is a town that welcomes us, which provides a modern terminal with tokens to take at the merchants and instead, some empty the gray water squarely on the area and toilets anywhere. Some (Spanish) soon the worst arrive at 1:00 am and make a mess of the devil, TV bottom and go back to the cemetery to fill the watering can .... it becomes depressing the campsite because everything is there! Except people?"
16443,656071,4,Gewar,24/08/2019,Great place to see near the desert entrance. Flat no draining and filling and not a lot of places.
16443,655212,2,denisroc,24/08/2019,Well located area at the foot of the troglodyte houses. Quiet night but no space between the camping -cars. There is a good restaurant (the bardenas) 300 m. There are bad smells that come from the factory located at 500 m.

16443,637140,2,calichy,17/08/2019,Beautiful setting but we spent the night just one night because it smelled so bad in the whole town. Two types of squares in general quite narrow. It was almost full. There is a nearby esplanade where we also saw vans and ACs.

16443,620467,2,marmotte77,12/08/2019,"Well located area to visit the city. Easy access, relatively flat. Regarding the services: easy emptying. Electricity only at the service station and NON-DRINKING water at 2 € the token. it's bad. Come only in autonomy or with the need to drain. Leaving to be in autonomy, we preferred by far, the car park of the Virgin of Yugo."

16443,581704,4,Rennie25,28/07/2019,"Almost perfect place, sanizuil something outside the parking but not used because very dirty and feces there. At the cemetery next to the parking, it is not clear whether or not drinking water is available, we only used it to wash dishes. Natural park is fantastic! We have visited with a rented 4x4, it is also possible with the camper however we have also entered smaller roads. Village is boring, but according to me there is a party once a year, everywhere there are meadow fences, to hunt cattle through the village, and a mini torro arena. Cave dwellings can be visited next to the parking. To the left of the parking is a small toilet block which we only found the next day."

16443,542921,3,briochons,07/07/2019,Certainly beautiful area if you are at the foot of troglodytes. By cons it is a pity to be surrounded by breeding of all kinds so flies and smells very unpleasant. This being good situation to start the track in the park of Bardenas
16443,519137,4,Raidertim,17/06/2019,"Perfect place to visit the Bardenas. In the village there is almost everything, the area is free but very busy, but this is great.

16443,494057,5,blondsea,27/05/2019,"Follow the entrance signs to the Parque de las Bardenas from the N-134, and then the signs to the area. The GPS (neither TOMTOM nor Google) does not know how to arrive. We parked the penultimate one Friday in May. The water and the emptying of waters is a little before entering the area, the water works with chips (jetons) that are bought in the town. There is no electricity in the squares. Quiet to sleep"

16443,487880,2,cmlaura,19/05/2019,"Very nice area with empty gray and black water free. But the water has to be paid, and does not accept euros. You have to go to a shop in the town to get it, and if it turns out, as in our case, that you arrive on a Sunday, then you do not have water. Nor was it clear to me if it was drinkable, because in a little sign I said no."

We were just woken up at 5:20am (21st Feb) to someone stealing one of our locked bikes from the rack on the back of our van. Would say given the time that this happened this was a planned theft rather than a opportunistic thief. We saw one male, we chased him & almost caught him before he cycled off. Shame as it’s a nice town, the locals made us feel very welcome apart from that & the spot is really nice next to the Troglodyte homes."

Tokens were said to be required but the fresh water was free when we filled up. Not sure on the electric though. We didn’t venture into town. Visitor centre for the park 5km drive and has motor home parking. We took our motor home into the park and it’s possible to drive all the way to the corvinas ravine if the weather is dry - the road is rough though. Spanish military range nearby - plenty of low flying F18s if you like that kind of thing !

16443,164129,2,alouette,03/08/2017,"Too bad, beautiful area with service and beautiful view, a beautiful place, but impossible to stay after dark swarms of mosquitoes attack you, we have never seen that. There were so many, it was the beginning of August."
16443,150391,3,cobra,11/07/2017,Quiet but for the view you should only look at the troglodyte side.
16443,147307,4,boairbi,02/07/2017,"Excellent stopover, little visit to the peaceful village, small shops, and the entire center of the village is covered with small cobblestones so almost no cars!! and what's more, in the motorhome area you can visit the troglodyte houses without entering them, risk of landslides. And it's clean and the night was quiet. Kind regards, Boairbi"
16443,141287,4,"rip,s",06/06/2017,Very nice parking lot. Very nice village with several bars and restaurants. Ideal for discovering the Bardenas park.
16443,138507,5,Toy8119,28/05/2017,Very quiet place to sleep. Excellent views of the mountain with local caves. It has a black water emptying area. We were there at the end of May on a weekend and it was practically full of ACs and vans. Highly recommended.

16443,129087,4,Giroquim,18/04/2017,"Right at the entrance to the Bardenas Reales park, it is a beautiful and well-equipped area. When we went (Good Friday) it was full and with more ACs parked outside the expressly delimited areas."

16443,125552,3,cham56,06/04/2017,"Conforms to the description of Guihome, beautiful place"

16443,119626,5,drinkalot,08/02/2017,"Superb place for a couple of days (48) hours stay. Quiet with rock dwelling cave's behind, water, both fresh and grey, toilet emptying facilities, bars and shop within walking distance."
16443,118100,1,voyageur18,10/01/2017,Nice area but sad village. Complicated to find a business
16443,117947,5,syl22,07/01/2017,"Beautiful, well-appointed and new free area with lots of spaces. The site is interesting and close to parks, Bardenas in particular, essential shops in the village, efficient WiFi on the town hall square. Many hiking possibilities from this area. To get to the area, do not go through the center of the village where the streets are very narrow, but follow the signs which pass outside via the Bardenas road."
16443,114585,4,jacko147,18/11/2016,Great area to if only to see the caves opposite the parking bays. They are lit up at night with changing colours.
16443,113222,4,evamsa,03/11/2016,"We went on Halloween weekend throughout that area and we slept on October 29th and there was not a single soul there, not only was the AC area full but the car area was also occupied and they were all very close to each other, the truth is a bit chaos! although the area is very close to Las Bardenas, and has water to fill and empty. The caves that can be seen from the area are very cool and at night the lighting changes color."
16443,112737,1,celineetyohan64,31/10/2016,"We went there at the end of October. Location on top of each other. No toilets, even in the center of the village. Good for a motorhome but not recommended for a fitted van without toilet."

16443,109427,4,KUyDAISY,09/10/2016,"Good area. Perfect for going by motorhome or by bike to see the Bárdenas Reales. Also perfect for going to Senda Viva, where you can also park your motorhome. The town Arguedas has very little to see."
16443,108675,5,paquito,03/10/2016,"I confirm, beautiful location with a view of the troglodytes which light up at magical night! For information, there is water at a terminal a little further away which works with tokens and something to drain, perfect. We stayed 2 nights, it was quiet. For information, inquire before visiting the Bardenas following the military tests, there are hours to respect... Info in the village and at the info point at the entrance to the site."
16443,105895,4,lesbordersgarou,17/09/2016,This parking area would be perfect with at least toilet facilities available. There is no water or electricity on site. In the immediate vicinity of the city center (city a little empty of entertainment and local life) located 5 minutes from the entrance to the Bardenas desert
16443,104923,1,kty,13/09/2016,"Services should be rectified. There is no water or electricity in the area. You have to go further to get services. Clean, pleasant site but we are woken up by packs of village dogs barking! Good for a stopover but nothing more.."

16443,92044,3,Amaury66,10/08/2016,"All is said. €2 per token for the terminal at the nearby gas station. Be careful not to go down from Sendaviva Park via the municipal road to Arguedas, during the holidays at the beginning of August, because of the encierro barriers, a big cold sweat with the camper van. To visit the Bardenas, hikes or mountain bikes or camper vans! And yes, a 30 km circuit is passable by vehicle."
16443,89090,5,nagore76,04/08/2016,"Very good area in a beautiful place, near the entrance to the Bardenas Reales Natural Park. Nearby there is a bar that sells bread and a small supermarket with basic things. The only drawback I can find is that the mosquitoes eat you alive because the area is surrounded by rice fields. Don't forget a good mosquito kit"

16443,80601,4,gsilva211,10/07/2016,"It is very well organized, but in summer it is very very hot and the mosquitoes eat you. Congratulate the City Council, one of the best municipal areas I have seen."
16443,80069,4,evelynethierry,06/07/2016,"Easy to access, well-defined spaces. View of the troglodytes (superb) emptying possible, shops and the gas pump issues tokens for water and electricity, no shade but nice and quiet place.

16443,62517,2,ventures,11/01/2016,"Arrived at night, impossible to return with the signs, the next day, right in the city center, stay calm. For the location, perfect, very clean, Euro Relais terminal with “non-potable water” signs so stock up beforehand. For the village, it's desert Spain, on the other hand in the city center, enter the family bar, under a porch, opposite the kiosk, at 5 p.m., grandpas, grandmas, grandchildren, we love it."
16443,62308,5,Mikel380,06/01/2016,"Pleasant and quiet place, the important thing about this place is its ancient caves where the last inhabitant left in 1965, and a perfect area to go out to admire the Bardenas Reales desert and make your journey along tracks in good condition."

16443,53237,5,dubradol,31/08/2015,Everything has been said about the quality of this area and its environment. Note for the forgetful the possibility of renting mountain bikes from Ciclos Marton in the center of the village (tel: 948 83 15 77) to be able to stroll in the Bardenas Reales.

Accessible from the east end of the city, and not from the center, follow the signs. The first 10 days of August takes place the village ""feria"", traditional atmosphere, bull release in the town and multiple festivities. In the middle of summer the air is quite busy (especially by the French, and you can meet nice people who love this application)."

Slightly noisy during the day with the busy alley. Very noisy on Saturday evening. Very active mosquitoes in the evening. as usual 18 places and we all stick next to each other it's better.
