Too bad because the location is good, close to the beach, shops and restaurants."

Pretty much traffic of people coming and going, even in the night. And in our case someone even tried to break into our camper at night, so be careful and close off everything. NB: showers currently out of order due to water restrictions."

14636,2642106,4,HarrySchmitt,05/04/2023,"I'm standing here for the third day today and will definitely be here over Easter. Is a normal parking lot with corresponding coming and going. Until 1.5. still free. No V/E, although there is a water supply on the children's railway from which you can get water in a canister without any problems. Distance 50 m towards the beach. I'm satisfied not to find anything comparable in the near vicinity at P4N."
14636,2626817,4,Cruizer76,27/03/2023,Currently free of charge. Vending machines specially locked so that you can see it. Even with a trailer (10m) we immediately got a double parking space. Great location right on the beach and promenade.
14636,2623603,3,mjtaylor66,25/03/2023,"Right nezt to gorgeous beach - gets busy but cars come and go so you might have to wait for a space

14636,2510420,4,jesusAcevedo,01/12/2022,On these dates it is free but in the summer months it is a blue zone. It's fine but you have to arrive early or it will be difficult for you to find a place because it fills up between cars and AC
14636,2507358,4,onenightaway,27/11/2022,"Great stop, nice town, right on the beach …. But don’t stay here Saturday nights, local young people turn up in cars and plays music until very late in the evening"
14636,2504539,4,anjappp,24/11/2022,"We stayed there for a night, it was quite and good. Lots of camper vans around. No free open toilets tho (they are open when bar Holalà is open), we went to the hotel bar across the street instead - they were kind to let us use theirs. Would recommend."
14636,2504313,1,lilietseb,24/11/2022,We were robbed on this car park on a Sunday in early October. Despite many people and passage.
14636,2486968,4,merymoon72,07/11/2022,"Great, on the same promenade there are bars, shops nearby. Without services, it is a free blue zone parking in winter. Fountain and garbage containers 1 minute walk. We stayed a couple of nights, constant movement of cars during the day. Despite staying on the weekend, calm down."
14636,2466319,5,romaromeo,28/10/2022,"Super SP, stay there 3 nights. Town and beach nearby. Restaurants minutes away. For families: There are various pitches around it. Railway Museum is worth a visit. For dog owners: there is a dog training ground in town 10 minutes away."

14636,2445708,3,Angelet56,15/10/2022,"only parking però next to the beach and the town. the places are very fair and the cars park next to it, which makes it difficult to open the door. Saturdays weekly market very close. If you can, it is better to come during the week because Sat and Sun a lot of movement of parked cars"
14636,2424678,4,surroundedbydetails,05/10/2022,"Free parking (during off season) right next to the harbour and 2 min walk to the beach. Restaurants, grocery shop and barber also close by. It’s a parking in the city so there will be some noise but nothing that bothered us. The secret to this place is to come mid-week, as weekends are always more busy in Spain, no matter where you are. We had 3 quiet nights here. No services."
14636,2410765,5,jmk71,29/09/2022,"we spent 2 quiet nights on this place, except for 2 motorhomes out of 15. Young burglars went through the side windows of the motorhomes in the middle of the morning. it was 11 o'clock. so far from the reviews everything is fine apart from this little problem, the place is still very good and the police come by several times during the night."
14636,2397072,5,AnnaSarvanti,23/09/2022,Great parking next to the beach. Free during off season. Had a quiet night.
14636,2341761,2,johnDido,05/09/2022,"too much noise at night, the boys who come back from beach parties scream and scrape off with their cars from the parking lot. otherwise it remains a good position"
14636,2294249,1,Triangulo,24/08/2022,Not recommended for sleeping. We had to leave there at 03:00 because strange people arrived in a car with music blaring.

14636,1946518,3,Samanthapaina,04/06/2022,"you pay it is not true that you eat it says it is free, the services are not there, the shower is from the beach and oh services, a good place to go in the afternoon to eat in the town"

14636,1803769,5,falajaltrips,02/04/2022,"Free parking in low season, perfect location and wide spaces. The bad thing is that if a car parks between two motorhomes, you have difficulty opening the door, but they are spaces and they have every right to occupy them. As a critic I will say that we have a van next to us with a generator on public roads and for things like that they take away places to spend the night."
14636,1760900,2,ivanCalifornia,20/02/2022,"parking with spaces, super narrow half a meter between vehicles or less, at night frequent bottles and their corresponding drunks with open trunks and music at full volume until 6am. the only good location. I do not recommend it."

14636,1734201,4,Fred1810,15/01/2022,"very good parking on the beach, very quiet.. possibility of more than 7 m free in winter.."
14636,1733787,3,miticoarpege,14/01/2022,"The car park is not very large and is used a lot by cars, so it is easy to find yourself bottled up. Free in winter and therefore thanks to the community. No thanks instead to fellow campers who go to empty the toilet in the manholes in the street at night, in doing so they will drive us out."
14636,1732100,5,Dargo34,11/01/2022,"free parking in this season a few meters from the beach and restaurants we spent the night there without worries, about fifteen cc were also there. I recommend out of season for a stopover"

At night: there were campers and cars in the parking lot, all quiet and peaceful, I slept well and undisturbed."
14636,1717583,4,EloiAA,28/12/2021,"Perfect parking for the winter season. Asphalted, level and with free spaces. Quiet at night and day, I understand it’s because it’s winter. I don't know if I would recommend it for the summer, there is no shade and it must be very busy."
14636,1716607,5,DominikaR,27/12/2021,"Wonderful place. A very calm night. A lot of space. Free in December. Close to the sea, bike paths. At the park. We stood one night"

14636,1706862,4,pacasu,09/12/2021,"Level, paved parking with limited spaces, although they are not very wide. we spent a very quiet night, without noise. at this time of year you do not pay, as it says in the photo of the sign. very well located to visit the town and stroll along the sea. The police passed several times and no problem, highly recommended at least on weekdays"
14636,1704801,3,crec,06/12/2021,"The great place, close to the beach, locals. But at night on weekends they make bottles in this parking lot and in the surrounding parks, they haven't done anything to us, but we have had music, shouting until 06:00. And last night an ambulance had to come to attend to a young man."

14636,1634711,4,NeeltjeJacoba2,09/10/2021,"Nice place, after september 15th free parking. Sea view and easy city acces. Beach 1 min walk.  Beware of the weekend evenings and nights, the locals are friendly but loud and have parking parties till 06h in the morning."
14636,1426229,1,PalomaMaidanik,08/08/2021,"If you go at night on a weekend there is a lot of light, noise and a lot of people pass by. In the heart of the city."
14636,1279569,2,PatrickSchmelz,26/06/2021,"I had no problems with my Womo to stand there for a day for 7 € and a night. Close to the beach / harbor / bars / town / restaurants. On the one hand this is great, but it also brings typical party noises and loud music with it. I was standing in the parking lot on a Saturday."
14636,1225760,1,Lola1956,30/05/2021,"We have spent the night from Saturday to Sunday, we will not do it again. When the beach venues close, which are several, groups of young boys with loud music, screams and obvious signs of drunkenness pass through the parking lot or stay for a while. Some of them hit us on the back doors just for fun ... then they left. They were passing until 5.30."
14636,1223893,3,sprinter6,29/05/2021,"It is not a parking for campers and much less for motorhomes, but it can be. Close to the beach, restaurants and the main promenade. From May to September there is a fee."

14636,766162,4,Cfuenmar,08/01/2020,"Perfect for visiting the city and walking along the beach or the small train park. Avoid sleeping on weekends, those days better sleep in the North parking lot, next to the Mossos police station, much quieter."
14636,757352,5,mumdventure,27/12/2019,"Very quiet parking in low season. Perfect for visiting the city and enjoying the beach. Close to the many restaurants, shops, playground ... I went there on the outward and return journey, never felt insecure."
14636,756952,1,Maryduesi,26/12/2019,"Caution! At night they tried to open our motorhome (driver and front passenger door). We woke up and, thank God, were able to chase away the burglars in time. Despite the beautiful beach and sunset, we would no longer stay in a public car park in Spain."
14636,739699,3,Scheneveymarc,07/11/2019,Very well near the city center without services and free in this period. Before me a French draining its gray water at the foot of unscrupulous flower beds !!!

14636,721965,4,Shed24,15/10/2019,"Stayed for one night on a Monday with2 other vans. Easy enough to find a space as it's out of season. Carpark is now fully tarmaced and level, signs confirm no parking charges as out of season. Only one car creating noise for about 20 minutes near to midnight, but otherwise a peaceful night. 2 minutes walk to the beach where dogs are allowed!"
14636,708037,3,Salvi-Juarez,29/09/2019,"Comfortable, near the center and the beach, but Friday and Saturday nights it is noisy due to the people who leave the bars and discos or bottle shops."

With great pools and other activities such as tennis and football pitches. Indeed a great place with well kept toilet and shower facilities. 10/10 can recommend"
14639,2746258,5,hopkik,13/05/2023,"Excellent site, the facilities are top rate from the supermarket to the swimming pools! We used caravan and motorhome vouchers with no issues, with ACSI as a backup.  Excellent bus service down to the town which was bustling on a Saturday with public transport to go to Tarragona and Barcelona by train. Lovely and quiet in low season, but could see it being very busy and noisy in high season."
14639,2727457,4,CamperlifeSundP,06/05/2023,"Campsite as big as a small village! Everything you need, supermarket, washing machines, swimming pool etc. Very nice reception! As an ADAC member with a caravan for two, we paid €25 a night, great value for money! The sanitary facilities are clean, but the showers constantly switch between hot and cold, definitely not a problem in summer. Especially recommended for families!"

14639,2504742,2,DieDreiTanten,24/11/2022,"Far too expensive space. 44€/night 2 people in the Bulli in the low season and then you have to pay extra for the WiFi. Unfortunately, from the end of November the only way to stand far and wide. The showers are stunning and gross. It stinks of drains and the tiles are coming off the wall. For the price you get a hotel room in the region. I find it outrageous."

There is also a strong smell of sewage in the sanitary facilities. The supermarket is well stocked and the prices are ok. The restaurant wasn't that good. Location is ok, but the bus to Barcelona doesn't leave Barcelona until 17.55 and 18.55. Great alternative for € 11.50 for two people."

Normal pools to top it off they tell us that on Sunday we had to go at 10 o'clock on the plot. We left without scrubbing breakfast, without discharging water and very angry. It is the first time we go and the last. Nefarious and not worth the price for what they offer."
14639,238032,4,kevrowan,18/04/2018,Big site with all facilities including indoor and outdoor pools. You can watch English football in the bar/restaurant. Only downside we found was the Wi-fi is very expensive although you can get a free hour if you buy a drink at the bar.

My advice is that you do not use any of the recommended places in all of Montjuich, they usually open the vehicles and steal everything they find of value. If I did not find another place I would sleep in Montjuich, but I would never leave my camper van alone. Regards."

Talk to the Guardia Urbana (offices just around the corner from the Palau) for clarification. Madness to park here. There is a motorhome parking area right beside the Pompeia Tennis Club for €30pd. Expensive but secure (guarded) and a handy spot to park for city access for a few days. Right near to the Palau and Poble Espanyol.
14640,78572,1,Pitxurri,26/06/2016,I live next door. The prohibition of parking for motorhomes is not legal in Spain. Some municipalities abuse this restriction. For one night it is not a problem. The real problem there is the 7% inclination. But that's yours!

No need for deluxe plots unless you need power.  Total tranquility under the shade of the trees.  Yes, bathrooms need an update but you don't much time there really.  Bar is cosy, great activities for kids and awesome pools.  To repeat for sure."

The sanitary facilities are a bit old and weren't exactly clean. A bit overpriced at €40 for 2 people and when you leave you should note that the reception is only open until 8 p.m.
14680,2969288,4,LenaKue,15/07/2023,Great campsite including two beautiful pools! Pitches are each equipped with a table and benches. ??One star deduction only because almost €38.90 for two adults with a car and tent roof is still a handsome price compared to other places.
14680,2950839,3,amilpin080,11/07/2023,"It's a pity the change of Huttopia company. Prices have gone up a lot, especially in July and August (we'll have to wait until September). Management expenses (€20) unjustified. Very quiet, very friendly and attentive staff, ideal for families with children. That said, the only penalty is the large price increase from one year to the next."

The reception is from 9h to 15h, if you arrive after the guardian you enter and you settle and you make the registration the next morning. 20 € / day all inclusive right now for a motorhome and 2 people.

Too early in the season because little activity, restaurant closed. And spent a night under water, ground barely stabilized. 2 parts in this campsite, one to 17 € with very small sanitary clean and another part 19 € with sanitary larger. The bad weather did not let us appreciate the places certainly well in other conditions."

How motorhome is 10 m American RV we have a trailer no problem with the size of the pitch. Offers electric water and chemical waste on some pictures. Stayed in March off-season therefore the restaurant was only open weekends. The site offers Wi-Fi which was not very good. The main shower block is the best showers I have used so far on a campsite. Excellent location for walks in the forest National Park with El Rocio just a short drive down the road. Reasonable priced with ASSI card with Electric. Would deafly recommend.
14680,222220,4,connicon,10/02/2018,"Family and quiet campsite in a beautiful natural setting in the nature reserve. Very nice staff. Two pretty pools. ASCI card also on the premium seats. Pitches large and very beautiful, partly sunny partly shady, quite sandy, with hedges separated, water and sewage available. Very bad mobile reception. Wifi costs extra, but good coverage all over the place. Sanitary ok. Be careful with the concrete slabs on the pitches, which are partially brittle - not traveled!

14759,2819932,5,Chess,04/06/2023,"If you like it...as a freedom camper looking for peace and quiet, this is certainly the wrong address, but the facility is exceptionally beautiful, the sanitary facilities are great, the staff is friendly and the leisure facilities, especially the water park, a Valhalla for children...recommended change."
14759,2747170,2,elfriedeborder,13/05/2023,"A very nice, clean place with all kinds of entertainment, a 5 star place. However, I wonder if there shouldn't be another place for disposing of the chemical toilet in the washroom. No space for the gray water disposal of the Womo's Pets are allowed, but there is only one way to go for a walk outside of the large space"
14759,2742578,5,Piaeh,11/05/2023,"We had a great time here with our kids. However, the pools are not heated, so at this time (April/May) they are still very cool. But all in all a great campsite and clean"
14759,2683028,3,letsgo21,20/04/2023,"Review of a young family with 4p. who stayed for 2 months. Campsite is very clean and well maintained. Friendliness of staff could be a lot better in our opinion. It is an expensive campsite, but you know that in advance and you will get something in return. It is a pity that the beautiful swimming pool with slides is not heated and is currently just a little too cold for a nice long swim. Supermarket is open for a long time and has democratic prices. The plots are neat and generally fairly flat. But we think these are too small by standard standards. A small plot is around 70m2 on many campsites. This campsite falls under Premium plot. What some may also find difficult is that there is 0% control of night noise. In short, it is a beautiful campsite, but also a real company where the family character is no longer there."
14759,2660041,5,AnikaDybowski,10/04/2023,"Multilingual very helpful reception staff. Facility very clean and modern. Pitches are great although the campsite is huge there is a feeling of privacy in your plot. An absolute highlight for the children are the slides, pools and playgrounds. Entertainment is guaranteed and there is a choice of restaurants too! 5 days all inclusive 370€ Easter holidays bomb!"
14759,2647342,4,sambadeivid,07/04/2023,"Very large campsite, with several restaurants, gym, shop with many things, spa, pool with slides. Facilities, toilets and showers very clean. Spacious plots with electricity and water in each one. Very quiet and beautiful walk to the beach. What we didn't like is that to empty the gray water you have to tell them at reception and they open a door for you outside the campsite, very bad service."
14759,2636350,5,Guentiwa,02/04/2023,"The campsite deserves an unqualified 5 stars from us. Pitches large and clean. Great WiFi. Nice reception and clean sanitary facilities. Only the price is not cheap at 40€, but quality has its price. The best place we've had in Spain so far."
14759,2619214,1,LucaBonicalza,22/03/2023,"One night for one person, tent and motorbike: €42! It was the only campsite open, never again."
14759,2575737,1,mariapa4182,12/02/2023,"We were in August, for what they charge per plot, at least one decent shade, please. To catch a shower that is not damaged, you have to be lucky. It is so big, that there are too many people everywhere. The slides are not well maintained, I brought the kids full of wounds from the joints on the slides. Plus you have to pay for everything. I won't be back for sure."
14759,2571322,5,tatamechanik,07/02/2023,"Exclusive camping , everything Top . You pay for the convenience ... I recommend a great campsite."
14759,2565578,1,matthiej,01/02/2023,"extremely expensive. (2nights, 2adults, 3 dogs, motorhome and electricity: €110!)
NOT a camping, but a resort.
only, non heated, outside pool available, indoor pool you have to pay extra (12€/person)
the checkinguy was eyeballing us the moment we came in
you'll never see us again."
14759,2545865,3,Roane,08/01/2023,I have been there 2 consecutive years in the summer. awesome first year. we had a blast with a great water park and top-notch entertainment team. the second. The Colosseum was opening. animation team much less approachable and stressed. there are only enough to make you spend a maximum damage.
14759,2539650,5,JamieGross,03/01/2023,"We stayed here for 6 nights over Christmas. Very relaxed with children. The permanent campers were very nice to our kids. We used the free gym, water park and marina park (indoor playground, table tennis). Gladly again"
14759,2531214,5,AnnaApel,28/12/2022,We were here for 4 days and everything was very clean! About 1km to the beach and many restaurants nearby.
14759,2528664,4,bushilde,26/12/2022,"The beach is great. Spa worth it. It is a beautiful, well-kept facility. Nothing for campers who love free standing. It's more like a club."
14759,2526117,2,deleila,22/12/2022,At this time of the year practically only overwinterers and you can tell that you are not so welcome as a short-term guest. I've had nicer sanitary facilities on cheaper campsites. Spa costs 12 euros for 1.5 hours ..... for a month 40 euros very peculiar pricing policy
14759,2497770,5,Rimantasb4,17/11/2022,"This was a sweet and cozy little hideaway. The staff were all very attentive, professional and just over all kind. The toilets and showers was clean. Great selection of many activitys. We felt very a safe and secure."
14759,2427831,4,calibeach,06/10/2022,"we spent 4 days in october very well and with a lot of space but in summer it has to be an anthill, 450 seats of acs, plus the bungalows, too many seats for the common spaces: restaurants, swimming pools, parks, mini golf, etc, our stay in october with children very good"
14759,2362037,5,nani71,11/09/2022,"Campsite with all the services you can expect, you don't have to go out at all, you have everything, perhaps the only one, but it has grown so much that there is a lack of space (especially in the pool area), it looks like a little crowded."
14759,2361068,2,borjaymaria811,11/09/2022,"one and no more!!! if you are looking for the charm and life of a campsite forget about this place, if you are looking for a non-stop and be entertained at all times without worrying about noise and spending money you will enjoy this place, be careful with children in the pools, as don't worry, the lifeguards are blocked if a child is lost, zero protocol. I don't think I'll come back, I'm looking for other things!!"
14759,2331915,4,frobles,02/09/2022,"We have been coming for more than 15 years and we have experienced all its changes. If you come looking for a camping site, this is not your place. if you come looking for an entertainment complex where you don't look much at what you spend and enjoy to the fullest. Welcome. This is a resort. leave the camping thing for other places."
14759,2138621,3,sanobino,28/07/2022,"5 stars not deserved, a factory to make money a lot of things are extra. The water park is nice but you have to manage to find a place... In short, apart from the price which is 5 stars 3 or 4 stars max would be more appropriate"
14759,2120029,2,Galar,25/07/2022,"The plots are very good, spacious and with good shade. But there is no respect for the hours of sleep on the part of the campers, and the campsite does nothing to remedy it. The pool with the slides very crowded, the Bali very well, although you have to pay for its use (after the stay is not exactly cheap). Lack of cleanliness in the toilets. In short, poor quality/price."
14759,1997646,3,sunny787,21/06/2022,"In and of itself a very nice place, especially with children. However, there is an extreme mosquito plague here. Both during the day and at night, one is attacked by mosquitoes en masse. Especially considering the fact that there are now disease-carrying mosquitoes in Spain, we felt very uncomfortable. Vll could the place operators take action in the future!?!?"
14759,1972861,3,reschima,13/06/2022,"Super five star campsite. Very clean, large, water park great for children, ten minutes walk to the beach, mini golf, supermarket, etc. Points are deducted for the many mosquitoes and the background noise on the square at weekends until night. Basically, the campsite leaves nothing to be desired."
14759,1946913,4,aberts02,04/06/2022,Great 5 star campsite (expensive) great location and nice water park. Clean shower / WC
14759,1853112,5,luiscamper,25/04/2022,"It is a 5-star resort, the best that can be found in the area, many activities and areas for children, a perfect supermarket, spectacular swimming pools, well-cared facilities, the spa is paid separately."
14759,1807451,4,lenication,05/04/2022,We stayed here for a week in a small square. Yellow category for 31€ per day for 7 days. Indoor pool costs 8€ adult and 4€ child for 90 min. The place is very clean. The supermarket very well. The coffee in the bar too. Childcare is great. I found it to be rather loud on the pitch. 2 days construction site in front of the door. At the weekend the place is very busy with Spanish long-term campers.
14759,1803022,5,Den_Twan,01/04/2022,"A more luxurious campsite if you will. They are friendly but confusing at the reception, if one asked a woman behind a certain place it was occupied and when I went in afterwards it was possible We chose the place with private bathroom (64 € per night) Lots of peace and spacious place There is so much to do and see here Outside the park, a bike is recommended, the village is 25 minutes on foot but doable"
14759,1797465,3,lasskris,27/03/2022,"Beautifully laid out CP. Plots separated by hedges. Everything very clean and tidy. Very good washing machine €4.50 & dryer €3.50. Wifi bad. We found the sauna & wellness area too small. Massage was ok. Unfortunately very expensive, 1 day/€50, from 3 days/€37.50 for the larger pitches for 2 people, bimobile, dog & electricity. Water is in every place."
14759,1781527,1,Mirosanchez,13/03/2022,"The worst place by far. We have paid €50 and it has been impossible to sleep beyond 6AM. Roosters, crickets, birds... can be heard at full volume from the wee hours of the morning and it is impossible to fall asleep. I don't know if there is a farm next door or if they have animals somewhere, but the rooster in particular is insufferable. Certainly not a place to return."
14759,1777323,5,AnselmoVC,08/03/2022,"Top class campsite!!! Very well-kept complex, great pool, nice and shady parcelling... everything you need... supermarket, gastronomy, dog shower, fitness studio, wellness - something for everyone. The staff was always friendly and helpful. The sanitary buildings are very neat and spotlessly clean. The beach (about 800m away) a dream"
14759,1759925,5,RLJL,19/02/2022,"All the details have already been described very nicely in one of the last long reviews. We agree. Have stood here for 31 days from mid-January and were completely satisfied. What we had to get used to is that it doesn't happen here before 9am. No supermarket, no fresh rolls... you almost become a late riser ;-) great place. Saturday is the weekly market near Lidl/Aldi"
14759,1747720,5,brunot656,04/02/2022,"Very nice campsite, pleasant welcome. Price 50 € for 2 people motorhome of 9.5m"
14759,1738006,5,Sunshine04,21/01/2022,"I won't give 5 stars that easily. But it is not without reason that this square is celebrated on the Internet as one of the largest and at the same time most beautiful squares in the entire Mediterranean region. If you miss something here, no matter what, you haven't looked properly. It is a bit confusing at first that there is no disposal station on the site. The reason is simple: Disposal takes place at every place! Only for those who use cassettes, there is a separate option on the square. For vehicles with tanks, there is a drain pipe at each site that is intended for both gray and black water. The prerequisite is that you have a hose that is long enough. If you don't get along with it, you can use a disposal station outside, in front of the square. You just have to register at the reception. Every pitch is cut differently! For vehicles more than 7 m long and/or more than 3 m high, it is very important to first inspect the site. The reason for this are some trees, sometimes the rods of the shading system and the distance to the sewage pipe. Visit first, then make a decision! Most pitches have 10 A electricity. Luxury pitches have 16 A. Many pitches not only have WiFi, but also LAN sockets. The path to the beautiful, fine sandy beach is 700 m long, paved and leads through the pine forest. Suitable for bicycles. Although this square is equipped with a large pool area and a huge, new amphitheater, there is absolute silence in the winter season, because these facilities are not used during this time. Restaurant is very good and the supermarket is great! Yes, the price is higher than other places. But quality and equipment also have to be paid for! We stayed here for two weeks during the winter season and paid €33 a day for a pitch of around 70 m² without an ACSI card. The longer you stand, the cheaper it gets. If you are thinking about standing in one place for a long time, this is the place for you! We felt extremely comfortable. In our opinion, it is by far the most beautiful place along the Spanish Mediterranean coast."
14759,1709655,2,wanderbulli1407,13/12/2021,"On the first evening we could watch the cockroaches race on the paths. Every morning we had to remove the excrement from cats in our place. Accordingly, it stank terribly! When asked at the front desk they just shrugged their shoulders, saying that nothing could be done. The sanitary facilities were clean so far. At least that. But we won't be back!"
14759,1685603,5,Horst0815,11/11/2021,"Very well-kept luxury campsite where you can and should endure it for a long time. Short stays are quite expensive, as you can hardly use the inclusive services. Great sanitary facilities, car rental, multilingual reception, cheap supermarket and really good restaurant. Treatment very nice throughout."
14759,1654037,3,chriscales,20/10/2021,Dear. Beautiful shaded and well delimited plots but not very practical for gray water (outside). Cold slide pool in this season. You still have to pay 8 euros more to access the swimming pools ... no green space for dogs. Superb beach on foot a km but if you can go out at the back of the campsite to go and return you have to make a huge detour ...
14759,1610133,5,Zhoser,26/09/2021,"Ideal camping to go with children, they will enjoy it a lot. It is not cheap but you have to pay for all the services it includes. Nice beach 15 minutes walk."

14759,1492682,5,alvarobi,21/08/2021,"Good camping. Strong points: water park inside that is impressive. Spa. Very quiet and familiar. Ideal to go with children. To put something wrong, it is not cheap and somewhat crowded in very high season."
14759,1481094,4,Reiseeuphorie,19/08/2021,"Great space for families, especially the water park. The sandy beach nearby is very nice. The cleanliness of the parking spaces and sanitary facilities as well as the service, however, not in the 5-star range, which one could actually expect for the high price."
14759,1459046,4,F.Miranda,15/08/2021,"Yes it is expensive, in August 9.50Euros per person (>12 years) and 60 euros for a place <6.00m, but it is the experience for the kid, because it has a Aquapark inside (with Covid only 3 hours per day and with appointment), we are paying for the services including the Spa. Electricity in This mounts is included on the price. If you don’t have kids avoid to come here in this month."
14759,1402110,5,hugogabarrigitano,04/08/2021,"Ideal to go with children, respectful people and silence at night, no music or loud voice, the only downside is that it is expensive but everything is ok"
14759,1187565,2,Elvaes,07/05/2021,"It is not worth to spend 1 night. Very expensive (50.- €). Very narrow interior roads that make maneuvering difficult. To empty gray water, you have to go outside the campsite in its maintenance area. Third world area to want to be a super camping. I attach a photo."
14759,1148465,4,Belen_69,07/03/2021,"Everything very clean, the restaurant very good. Good WIFI. As it hits the inner streets are very narrow and it is a bit difficult to maneuver with a large motorhome.

Plots with water and electricity, depending on the size, the price varies, a large volume in a small plot, plenty. € 62 day 2 adults, 2 children and dog. Expensive, but the services they offer deserve it. Animation, sports courts, surveillance. At night absolute silence."
14759,996626,3,Peketoy,23/08/2020,"It is fine but it is not to shoot rockets either. Camping for children, for adults from my simple point of view. Price for an AC with two adults and two dogs with a medium-large plot € 62 per day."

At first I was put off by the size, but with the variety of offers, it was ok. for our dogs there was a pool and much more. Everything was very nice and clean. 100 m to the beach! I have to deduct 1 point! I was looking forward to the relaxation pool! Unfortunately, there were a lot of small children who made noise, nothing to do with relaxing!"

A place for families with children that can be seen everywhere. I went there because there is a private pool for dogs. Otherwise, the possibilities for jogging for dogs are poor, if the dog does not enjoy being surrounded by traffic."

As a negative point, the standard plots do not have water and their access can be difficult. In short, we will repeat."

Admittedly it's expensive but it's a resort and the beach is across the road, shops, bar and Salou accessible by bus for 2€. 5 swimming pools, 3 mini-markets, restaurants, evenings.. on the other hand if you want calm…. Perfect if you have kids though."

Terrible service. And null covid measures."

Everything is just right for us (you have to love the buzz) Really everything is there and you can stand cheaply or go for all the luxury and space and pay more. It is a party for the children because there is a lot of children's entertainment and with 4 swimming pools no more worries. 2 supermarkets available. 5! Toilet/shower buildings. We will come again.

14808,1493531,1,Sorifer90,21/08/2021,"Terrible experience. One of the attractions of the campsite are the swimming pools, their condition is shameful, it is impossible to find a hole in the water, too many people in all of them. The cleanliness in the services and pools could be better for what they charge. We spent two hours and requested a departure with a refund of the money. After fighting we got the refund except 50 EU for negotiations."

I am at the entrance and the pool is at the bottom of the campsite (huge) But that said: it is clean, not far from the beach, a bit far from the center walk for me who struggles to walk but otherwise people are great nice. No acsi card so for me: 118 € for two nights at 5 with electricity. No supplement for the dog. At this time not many people, and outside a mini market with super staff, extra"

14808,246037,3,LandryFamily,04/05/2018,Arriving we were a little scotché by the size of the campsite and marked promiscuity (we like wild camping in peace then it is to say?). The nights are quite calm despite the number of campers. All activities are on-site: 5 swimming pools 3 restaurant ... hallucinant. Taken divided into a rate for a location + 6 € / person ... so 24 € for one night on average it takes (with electricity). Close to the sea. Sanitary clean but nothing exceptional.

14808,138997,3,Minipouce,29/05/2017,We chose a premium location with water and grass evacuation as the others are on yellow earth and on top of each other. Sanitary perfect. Perfect services: supermarket restaurant and entertainment. On the other hand expensive: 7 € per adult 23 euros the site per day out of season. No supplement for dogs. Beach nearby as well as the railway but not annoying

The prices are very correct compared to the benefits at least for the period that I go. Obviously given the size of the campsite, it is possible that in July and August it is very overloaded, and that we are far enough in the camping given its size, but hey it must be due to success. It is also true that no matter which month you want to spend, it is better to book, to have my place this year I had to book during my vacation last year, in the plots where I was, there were only 6 seats left in September, that's all to say ... 4 stars because it's worth it."
14808,29209,3,xav50,14/11/2014,"We went to this campsite in early September and 12 nights. Approximately € 23 per day for motorhome pitch with 2 adults and 1 child. Very very complicated when we arrived fully booked the campsite. We had not booked. We said in September it will be quieter, but not the Spanish do not return to school before September 15. So little room to give us, the first place very complicated to put a motorhome and dirty, so back to the home. He gives us other places, we will see on the spot, we go down to the reception to reserve the place time to do that, we go back with the motorhome arrived in the place, a dude we stakes the place, then back to the home, the 3rd time it was good, but it lasted more than 3 hours all that, plus a big heat with a toddler complicated. Otherwise the location, we were good, because the campsite is super large, it is more a village, we were 800 m from the reception and 1 km from the beach. The campsite is super nice, clean always cleaned showers and toilets, except the pool too crowded, so hygiene to see! yet there are 3 pools, a stage show, 2 groceries really correct price, 2 restaurants, doctor, a laundry for about 11 € a woman does your laundry, a souvenir shop. So noise until 00:30 should not seek calm, yet the location where we were, not too much passage. I do not think the redo this campsite, just passing! Otherwise not too far from Salou and Cambrils a lot of people and shops. The beaches are beautiful but you have to find a little place to settle. It's great if you have bikes with you."

14823,204543,5,marieangemorel,20/10/2017,It's perfect. Quiet: we are alone. Clean. Lay flat on pretty cobblestones. Of course we are mid-October and weekdays. The ruins of this castle are beautiful and free. The city accessible by alley stairs or not. The steeples answer each other. The inhabitants live simply. It reconciles with homelessness after hating Sintra and the hordes of tourists we were.

During the day there are many people along the promenade and the beach, but there is no feeling of insecurity, at least in the low season months (April). A lot of noise from planes, and bad coverage. The natural area is beautiful, a long walk to the delta. Recommendable. After going around Bcn many times, this site seemed safe to me."

We were only on the beach for half an hour and the car was broken into despite the parking attendant and all valuables were stolen. The parking attendant just told us that this would happen more often here (even though they are there? Very incomprehensible.) Didn't stay the night then.
14962,2070146,3,Hectoribio,13/07/2022,A good option to wait to board the ferry. The port is 25 minutes away. The guarded parking lot. The beach is not bad either.

Hardly anything going on at this time of year and there is also a toilet, but without paper. Felt pretty safe, sometimes cars come in with people smooching, but it doesn't really bother us. The runway is close, but you get used to the noise and almost no planes fly off at night."
14962,1698559,4,roadtoparty303,27/11/2021,"I spent 2 nights in this car park, I had no problem with theft! The beach is 10 m in front of us what more could you ask for? Of course there is the airport 500m away with a lot of flights. But the scenery makes us forget the coming and going of planes. There is a prohibition sign at the entrance but it should be taken into account only for the high season! Out of season you can park."

14962,1676749,5,CyrilleGrand,03/11/2021,"We stayed there for two nights, nothing to report other than the noise of planes ... which is quite normal near an airport. To visit the city we went to the parking lot of El Prat station (15min, free)"
14962,1655403,4,daroelmonge,21/10/2021,"I slept here two nights, the place for me is fine. Parking is free on these dates and there are more options nearby also where to sleep. It has paths for biking and running. 2km along the beach there are tables and chairs to eat. The bad thing is that the van next door to me they rebounded when they went to the showers, they left everything open. Just don't get too careless. It is a place that I would return to !!"
14962,1655202,4,foxyandgreen90,21/10/2021,"We stood here one night in October. Very few campers. Right on the beach. Showers can be used (but no shampoo!) And toilets (relatively narrow). With earplugs you can get enough sleep too! Since the holiday season is over in October, we didn't have to pay anything and the dog could go to the beach without any problems. Totally okay for one night!"

We spent the day at the beach, very well. As a car park next to the beach, I recommend it without a doubt."
14962,1607161,5,RaketaPodKozolcem,25/09/2021,Top parking place near the beach (50 m away).  We were there only during the day.
14962,1554494,5,clementjaeger,06/09/2021,Amazing place. Gets real busy during weekends in daytime. We spent 4 nights there. Check arrivals and departures of El Prat before to know if there is enough „quite time“. The police drives by regularly (also at night) and tolerates campers if you don’t let things outside and behave unobstrusive- made us feel safe. Water/Showers/Toilets/Bar/Dumpsters/Small Outdoor Gym.
14962,1463678,4,JYE,16/08/2021,"Great, quiet at night, ideal to spend the night, x the day you have to pay. It can be a problem if you don't like airplane noise. they pass every 10/15 min, it is only a moment. It was not a problem for me. PS: I would give it 5 stars for me"

We were going to pick up a girl friend at the airport on Friday morning, and we decided to go by van. We saw that there was the beach nearby and some comments about the night. Although we certainly went. There are two parking areas, one of which is paid from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and the other is for residents. At 9:00 p.m. we leave it to residents. We had the doubt if it was possible to spend the night"

14962,1264835,3,JosePili06,19/06/2021,"Currently paying and the beach opposite is under construction. Even so, it is worth coming first thing in the morning or at the last minute and parking at the end of the road on battery (also paid in summer) because the area is quieter. Free from 21 to 9"
14962,1257443,3,CamperLion,15/06/2021,"A good place to sleep near the airport. The bad, the bottles that people make there at night. You can hear the planes, but you can rest without problem."

14962,1239505,3,hugobaltasar,06/06/2021,"As in high season there is a fee, it is worth continuing a few more minutes to park where they do not charge, in front of the beach. In any case, there is a lot of airplane noise in the area - to spend the night you need deep sleep or earplugs"
14962,1175675,5,genisru,18/04/2021,"Good place to sleep, quiet and in front of the sea, the only drawback is that you have the airport next door and the planes leave often, if you are sensitive to noise they will wake you up .. but if not super good !!"
14962,1174020,4,nigsin,15/04/2021,"Right on the beach in front of the airport. There is a public toilet nearby and there would be showers on the beach. The place is clean, a bit muddy when it rains. It was quiet in the night. There were more campers on the square."

14962,793510,4,Vali1929,09/03/2020,A large parking lot in front of the beach. You have drinking water nearby and also bathrooms. It is true that you listen to airplanes but nothing that plugs do not solve and walk to the viewpoint of good morning to see the planes take off has its charm. We have spent a night without any inconvenience.

The noise did not bother. But we do not sleep there for security ""fear"" hahaha"
14962,117953,1,habein,07/01/2017,"To spend the day yes. The night no! Planes take off every 1 to 5 minutes until 1am. Resume at 7am. Passage of the Guard at midnight, and all-night passage of cars.

14962,79768,1,mustio,05/07/2016,"Very nice place, but close to the track. There is no one to sleep, the planes when taking off seems to get into the motorhome. We're going somewhere else."
14962,75188,4,Damienetmargot,31/05/2016,"The planes are annoying the first day but then we do not hear them anymore, and if it's the price to pay to have such a view it does not bother me at all. The night is relatively calm and the day becomes a friendly beach. The authorities look after the parking lot with a regular round (very reassuring). I'm going camping in the same place in July"

15010,2555100,5,zentrumsounds,18/01/2023,"It’s not cheap (and no ASCI card option) but this smallish site is a really great option that has excellent access to the city, really warm washroom facilities, and best of all has an excellent restaurant that is frequented by many locals on special occasions. So don’t miss an opportunity to book a table if you’re there! Laundry facilities are €4 (quite steep) but there is a launderette nearby."

15010,2541816,5,aldotorre,05/01/2023,"A jewel, simply a jewel. Make a reservation absolutely because places are few and it's always full, but it's worth it. The restaurant (to be booked separately) deserves a separate discussion, let's say that it is definitely not a ""camping"" restaurant"
15010,2535127,4,campiquipugui,31/12/2022,Camping with a bit narrow plots but with all the services. We were here 2 nights in the summer and we would definitely go back. You have to book in advance because it is always very full. With an ideal pool to cool off. Bus line and taxi service that leaves you in the center for very little.
15010,2535119,4,tresamigosontheroad,31/12/2022,Very friendly stuff!! Facilities are clean but the parking slots are very narrow. The restaurant at the campsite looked great and well visited! There is also a well equipped supermarket.

Clean functional sanitary facilities, friendly staff, good compact size, great restaurant and good proximity to town. Every 20 minutes by bus for €1.55 into the city-so easy and fast! €20.40 per night in December. Definitely recommend for a stay near Granada!"

Pool, washing machines, dryers, hot water in laundry rooms, heating in bathrooms, a good restaurant and supermarket, several bus lines at the door direct to Granada, Mac Donalds at the door and a deli shop 500m away. Friendly treatment. We have seen parking large 4x4 trucks and a 9m double-axle car. We will be back."
15010,2507726,5,TonyRaynor,28/11/2022,A warm welcome from good English speakers. Location is good for both Granada and Alhambra (€15 taxi). Burger King 100 metres and Mercadona 600 metres. Access for tall Motorhomes is good and length 8 metres is fine. Both restaurant and kitchen are being completely refitted and are likely to be good as they are caring owners. Toilets/showers are clean and quaint
15010,2505686,4,fundp,26/11/2022,"Good place with great connections. Booking in advance seems a good idea (also for the Alhambra). The facility is very small and the restaurant was closed. Toilets were clean, showers were ok."

Very clean sanitary facilities, a smiling and benevolent welcome, very shaded pitches with small “lawn carpet” for a small dining or relaxation area, bus at the exit to be in the center of Granada. The campsite ordered a taxi for us to reach the Alhambra for a very reasonable price. To recommend."
15010,2462217,5,Diplo,25/10/2022,"Very small campsite and a real challenge for large caravans. The place was always fully booked in the evening. Everything is included in the price, warm shower, soap on the sink, toilet paper in the toilet and also the supply and disposal. Electricity is to be paid separately. Bus stop in the immediate vicinity. Get on once to the final station Zentrum and get off! 1.55 euros the trip."

15010,2421209,3,valou44119,03/10/2022,"Disappointed by this campsite compared to the comments. Admittedly, it is close to Granada and the young woman is very welcoming, but the places are small, being on the roadside, there is constant noise, the swimming pool is not maintained, and we did not have hot water during 3 days …for 30 euros per day."

The price may be high but you have to take into account everything it has with the addition that it is the closest to Granada and Sierra Nevada at the same time, in addition to the fact that a bus passes through the same door every 20 minutes that leaves you in grenade. You can order bread and croissants for the next day, which is really a detail."

15010,1726572,3,Catherinegirerd,05/01/2022,"Campsite good for its location, but some services leave something to be desired. 30 € with electricity, the showers are certainly clean but not very hot, as for the washing-up area there is no hot water at all. BE CAREFUL they only accept CASH !!! Also, remember to book because very quickly full!"

15010,1702246,3,miquelrace,03/12/2021,"The camping is quite good, and the staff very friendly and attentive. I only recommend that the plot where you park is not covered with tree branches if you do not want the roof of the motorhome to wake up full of pigeon and bird droppings"
15010,1700893,5,ginavalli,30/11/2021,"Beautiful campsite, with all possible services. Spacious and clean hot water showers. Unfortunately a little out of the city, it takes two buses to get there, but in 20 minutes maximum 30 you are in the city center. Highly recommended"
15010,1699068,4,Carloscalvoconde,27/11/2021,"A charming campsite, very well connected with three bus lines to the center of Granada. With ACSI card € 20 / night in low season. They should put the gray and black water exchange area further away from the toilets. The bar-restaurant is very good. 300 mts. a multiplex cinema and a shopping center plus a gas station. Highly recommended."
15010,1698260,5,frintropergrill,26/11/2021,"€ 20 per night with electricity, waste disposal, water, sanitary everything OK. Enough free places even without pre-booking. Alhambra tickets without any problems at the box office. Perso required."

Select staff attention. A little bit expensive for camper but we can't wait to go back. We will repeat soon."

A small shop with the necessary if necessary, a restaurant (closed on Wednesdays), all services (garbage, laundry, toilets, drinking water ect). A bus passes in front of the campsite for Granada. I recommend !"
15010,1688588,4,Letspgr,14/11/2021,"There are two types of pitches, the cheapest are 19.60 for one night, two people and a van with electricity in November. These pitches are a bit narrow and with little privacy. The advantages of the campsite: bus stop at 1 'with bus to the center of Granada in 15', heated bathrooms and hairdryer and everything is very clean and quiet. I recommend it for a good stay in Granada."
15010,1671645,4,LC06,31/10/2021,Campsite well placed for access to the city in 20 minutes by bike and Mercadona supermarket 5 minutes away. Quite narrow pitches of course ... It goes well with a 6 m van. A lovely swimming pool and numerous clean toilets. Very calm night. I recommend.
15010,1670336,5,oldman65xxl,31/10/2021,"Nice, small and clean campsite with everything you need. Friendly staff. Definitely pre-booked, even in autumn. Bus connection to Granada, 1.55 euros, and to the Alhambra, another 1.40 euros, ideal. Taxis are inexpensive. We booked a flamenco tour with food through the CP. Both were excellent. Granada with the Alhambra was a great experience."
15010,1669938,3,vanzimut,30/10/2021,Camping full shame .. not a lot of camping in the area
15010,1667612,4,vanhomi,29/10/2021,"The nice little campsite is ideal for seeing Granada and is therefore very popular, so call ahead. The plots are sometimes narrow. The subsoil is natural, partly covered with gravel. The many trees provide shade. The sanitary facilities are clean. There is a nice pool and a good restaurant on the square. The place La Zubia is unfortunately not very attractive."
15010,1651441,4,mich81380,18/10/2021,"Perfect for visiting Granada. The bus is 300m away. small pitches, be careful with large CCs. perfect welcome. nice swimming pool. I recommend."
15010,1644074,4,Fiflc,14/10/2021,"Practice. near bus. small but with washing machine ... possibility of cable loan, booked on the internet very easy and reassuring not to search and waste time in the city on the other hand flamenco show sold is a scam, in any case the meal, because the dance was very beautiful and as we are taken there, we can accept the price ... but the meal is unspeakable!"

15010,1631678,1,Papyducati,07/10/2021,"Tiny crowded campsite, no full places. People are on top of each other. We left and found another campsite (near a lake and in the Sierra) with room and much better. I do not recommend it, they take advantage of the proximity to the city and the lack of infrastructure in the area."
15010,1624765,5,Bluebaluu,03/10/2021,"We felt comfortable here. Small and beautifully laid out. The pool is great. 16 €, 2 people with van. Fully booked even in the off-season. The bus is a great way to get into town, with a supermarket close by."
15010,1621139,3,weinsi,01/10/2021,"Actually a parking space if you consider the size of the parcel. The reception is friendly and relaxed. We got the last seat without a reservation, but only for one night. He tried hard. A bus stops in front of the door, but it doesn't go to the Alhambra either. Okay for one night, but actually too expensive."
15010,1617126,5,lyceo38,29/09/2021,"Nice campsite, quiet, well-defined spaces, very clean sanitary facilities, beautiful swimming pool. Be careful, book online because there are many requests.

15010,1502713,4,AioraAG,23/08/2021,"Highly recommended campsite to get to know Granada with good bus connections. It is small, which makes it cozy, but the pitches are a bit small in my opinion. One point in its favor is that you can choose between several of the plots that they offer you. Although there are those who praise it, the water in the pool seemed too cold to me."
15010,1499506,5,juan0815,22/08/2021,"Super clean (it is cleaned 2-3 times a day) and everyone is very friendly! The plots are a bit smaller, but we don't see that as a problem. On the contrary, there is more shade available, which is really nice here in Granada. The bus into the city takes 10-15 minutes and costs € 1.55."
15010,1497306,4,adrien3721,22/08/2021,Small pitches but even without a reservation the receptionist offered us two pitches. If you have the backpacker's guide you will have a 5% reduction think about it

15010,1476782,4,AraleNoriMakina,18/08/2021,"A very small but correct campsite, plots delimited by quite intimate bushes, a piece of artificial grass that helps well-being, a small but correct swimming pool, quite clean services, a 5-minute BUS stop, definitely a good option if you are going to visit Granada, For what we use the camping just to visit Granada it can seem a bit expensive."

15010,1387688,4,jucalander,31/07/2021,Perfect campsite for a visit to Granada. The toilets are in optimal condition and the price seems right to me. A curious note is that the pitches have an area of artificial grass to walk comfortably and not fill you with earth. A pleasant surprise.

15010,1359414,4,IzaskunP,24/07/2021,Small and very practical campsite. With shadow. Ideal to visit Granada. The water in the pool is cold which is very appreciated and with a good schedule from 9-9h. Friendly staff. Clean bathrooms. Bus to the center: € 1.55 per person and € 9 taxi. It has been a success.
15010,1330105,4,wilmar,16/07/2021,"Correct camping to visit Granada, pitches with hedges and shade, very friendly staff with all kinds of explanations of Granada. The worst is the pigeon shit that is huge, but the campsite is not to blame."

15010,1218084,5,camillewtr,25/05/2021,"The campsite is actually open at the moment. Nice campsite, pitch with electricity 23.30 euros. The showers are clean. There is a small restaurant open for lunch. The best part: the location is the best compromise we could find to be close to Granada but not necessarily in a city center car park. It is difficult to find spots in Granada itself and the campsite allows easy access to the center by bus. Buses are quite frequent (every 15 minutes)"

15010,785745,2,tomb5607,24/02/2020,The camping its self is fine and has everything you need it's very tight and pitches are small. But the constant smell of burning plastic is unbearable it prevented me and my partner from sleeping one night it was so bad we could hardly breathe in the van. it's also extremely noisy constantly moving Van's as it's such a small site it is very disturbing. it is located conveniently to visit granada but I wouldnt recommend it if you have another option

15010,398400,4,hopeontheroad,24/10/2018,"We liked it here very much. Nice reception. Very clean and for our Campingvan (Sprinter) also enough space to feel comfortable. For larger vehicles, some pitches could be a bit tight. Great room to bathe baby. Nice pool. Good price, 22 € f. 2 adults, vehicle and 2 toddlers. The sinks are only 2 with hot water. But since never before have more than 2 people flushed, it was okay. We have washed for 3.50 € laundry. Unfortunately, the machine is currently only washing cold, detergent is included. Clean was the most anyway. For breakfast you could order croissants and bread. A croissant is the size of two and costs 1 €."
15010,393568,3,Eulenspiegel,14/10/2018,"Nice, small, city campsite with charm. To Alhambra by bus about 1 hour drive. Shops nearby within walking distance. But there is also a very small shop in the campsite. Nice restaurant that is also visited by locals."

Nice pool and good meal with a delicious beer at the campsite.ideal restaurant to visit lalhambra we took the taxi option about 10 euros for 2 people. nice pool very nice
15010,299767,4,filou46,24/07/2018,Remain a very good solution to visit Granada with the bus that passes in front of every 15 minutes and park in the shade. Swimming pool very pleasant when it is 40 degrees and especially closes at 9 pm. We paid 120 euros for 3 nights to 4 people.

15010,244173,2,PapiPhil,01/05/2018,"Expensive camping for what it is. Price of a 4-star hotel with only 2. Old sanitary (but clean) and cramped spaces. Too bad because with a minimum of renovation and maintenance, its geographical location would make it very attractive."
15010,238260,2,DanielF,19/04/2018,There are a lot of campers on a small area. The cars have to stand very closely to each other. Bathrooms are old fashion and do not look nice. Wifi available for 1€/day/device. Plus is that there is a bus station near the camp ground. But it takes up to 1 hour to get to Alhambra because you have to change the bus at the busstation in Granada Central. Would not recommend but for 1 night OK.
15010,230314,3,mlp,28/03/2018,"In peace, well bus because in front. Payment requested in cash. It is better to book tickets for the Alhembra before because the campsite takes 5 € / person more for the reservation. During Holy Week long before we were fooled. We will return next week to make the visit."

Friendly welcome although a little cold. French speaking staff. Grocery store, nice restaurant, bar, laundry, paying wifi, swimming pool (still open in October!), All water services, ...). A bus line a few meters takes us to the city center in 10/15 minutes for € 1.50. Note that the campsite is cute, beautifully landscaped and pleasant. Which does not spoil anything. The reception sells tickets for the Alhambra for 5 € commission. The advantage with their reseller access is that they manage to have places when on the website is however indicated complete. In short, a very nice base for a few days. I advise :)"
15010,202081,1,domido76,11/10/2017,"Arrived at 6 p.m. Complete campsite. We are asked to park in a car park a little further up and come back tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. without certainty of having a place. Too bad for us, we won't be visiting Granada this time."
15010,195478,4,brunolutheo,19/09/2017,"Nice campsite, very warm welcome in French with offer to reserve tickets for the Alhambra and flamenco evening. Small pitches but still OK if you are on the middle pitches towards the toilets. Book because there is little space and the campsite in the center of Granada is closed for work. Motorhomes queue in neighboring car parks to get a place."
15010,139760,3,cp,01/06/2017,Narrow pitches. We're feeling a little suffocated. Average reception quite cold in French however. Otherwise very good for visiting the city. The bus is 50 m away and takes you to the city center. Practical but to be avoided for very large people.

Tip - don’t park near the fence to the car park as youths hang around in their cars blasting music till late. A bit noisy with traffic but it’s near the main road so to be expected. Fully fenced so felt quite secure. Great clean facilities for grey and black emptying & getting fresh water. Thank you for providing this facility."

15033,2578819,4,gg13013,15/02/2023,Large area a little noisy near the highway. To go to Madrid two solutions: the bus line 421 (and not 241) to take Calle Valdemoro. Go to Legazpi terminus (5km place Mayor!). Metro to Sol station (line 3). The train is faster (24' against 40'). Pinto station = 25' on foot. Platform 1 towards Atocha. For the return Atocha station platform 6 towards Aranjuez. We preferred the train.
15033,2570147,5,patou241,06/02/2023,"A very good spot to visit Madrid. You feel safe there, Leclerc is next door with the laundry. Impeccable, clean services. Bus 241 takes us to Legazpi in 30 minutes for €2.60! It just lacks electricity (but at €8 for 24 hours you shouldn't ask too much). It would be necessary to recycle the glass on the other hand."

Now because of COVID, the bottle is prohibited"

entry at any time as site is barrier with ticket entrance, price states €8 for the night, but we arrived at 7.30pm and left at 9.30am and were only charged €5.70. pay with visa/mastercard on exit.
we heard a few fireworks set off randomly during the evening, but not sure if it's because it's close to new years eve. 
just across the carpark from the shopping centre, and I'd feel safe leaving the van here to get a train into madrid for a day or two but sadly we didn't have time for a visit but hope to return one day and will stay again."

15033,521535,3,pg35,19/06/2019,"Good for a stopover, close to shops, near highway noise, cheap fuel nearby"
15033,502951,5,infante46,03/06/2019,"Excellent, a 10 for the town hall. Good facilities, economic price, good location with shopping center next door, cheap gasoline (€ 1.19 today), large park to walk around with the dog. surveillance and fencing cameras. For this price of the best, very good installation of water and drainage. those who complained about the price are miserable, the bullies bother you all in the end."

Very central, fenced, with cameras, service for motorhomes (drinking water, empty of gray and black, lighting ...) close to the train to Madrid and all for five euros a night.

15033,469367,1,esencia,27/04/2019,"It has stopped being free. We have been coming for a long time to just change waters and, either it was free or very cheap, it counted for minutes (15 cents). Today we have found the unpleasant surprise when leaving to have to pay 3 euros for 10 minutes. Only changing waters is no longer worth it. I have not noticed how much it costs to spend the day. 3 euros is for 1 hour or less"

So, 3 € the first hour (or only for emptying and full of water), then 0,0036 centimes the minute the first day then 0,0055 € the following days. About 8 € per day, very reasonable prices considering the quality of the area and proximity to Madrid. Limited to 7 days. Thank you to the municipality."
15033,454117,5,francisa,13/04/2019,"Actually very well this area, but unfortunately free for a short time. But 0.33 € per hour is still reasonable at the gates of Madrid."

15033,436888,4,UshuHay,06/03/2019,"We were on the night of March 4. Ample space, and large area of emptying / filling. The noise of the highway becomes a constant runos that did not prevent us from sleeping. Although it is better to use plugs if you are sensitive to noise. You are next to a big city and you can also hear the trains, the occasional plane and ambulances. The access area is under construction and at 8.15 began to bite. But I imagine that in a few days they will have finished. The area is located next to a huge park and a large shopping center."

15107,972716,3,arkimac,17/08/2020,We slept there one night. The site is good because it is on the beach and close to the leisure / restaurant area. But at night young people pass by to go to the bottle beach. There is an asphalt parking with few spaces and at the bottom an access to a natural land area with a few others. Overall good. It was full when we arrived (August).
15107,836565,4,pamana80,25/06/2020,It is small so I recommend going early or late when the cars leave. Next to the beach. There is part asphalt and another part of sand. Be careful not to get stuck. recommendable

The road is still completely cut off to vehicles just metres from the bridge as the result of an avalanche in December 2016.

OK for one night but thought being right in front of a 5* hotel was not such a good idea. Didn't go into the Palace as they were not prepared to allow us a English or anything other than Portuguese speaking guide. So we saved €14 there.

I do not understand what the problem this province has with this type of tourism. We cannot travel tied to campground schedules !!!!!!! We travel en route! and I don't need any camping service, except to empty and fill deposits that we thankfully pay where the service is offered. Too bad for not understanding or protecting this tourism. Without us in the off-season, many villages would be dead.

15133,233382,5,txapela_buruan,04/04/2018,"Beautiful place, you sleep a few meters from the beach. From here there is a path to the left that takes you for a beautiful walk to the cala del toro, highly recommended. Visit the tapas of the La Ola bar, to our liking the best with difference in quality, and above all, kindness. It seems that there is no overnight problem, since we share night with a lot of vans and AC in April"
15133,227799,3,phildeslandes123,15/03/2018,"Three stars because no water service on the fountain in the center of the village, otherwise 5 stars for calm and walks"
15133,222760,4,mirabelle9,14/02/2018,"Parking one day tolerated, another one gets fired. Understandable considering the behavior of incivilities especially of motorhome of Northern Europe. Unpacking chairs, tables, wedges etc. Some people get in or empty their toilet. Regrettable while the site is superb. A very typical village."
15133,213783,4,bernard19,06/12/2017,"Passed in November, not very clear to know if the night is allowed! Small, friendly village, quiet."

Very little flat area so ramps essential, care driving on as ground rutted. All worth it for fabulous view and beach. Couple of restaurants/bars open and a small convenience store.
No services other than a waste bin."
15133,209223,3,Eiderizagirre,04/11/2017,It is not allowed to spend the night in any of the two gravel car parks that are facing the beach. There is a signal that prohibits it. The board made us.

15133,204400,4,Coco56momo,20/10/2017,"After having been at the Los Escullos car park where there was nobody, we preferred to try this car park. We stayed here the night, about 8 campervans and vans in total. Beautiful place and very pleasant night."

Quiet and recommendable place with beautiful views and without noise. Of the most beautiful areas of Cabo de Gata."
15133,191753,3,ferrary,09/09/2017,Good place to spend the night but in the low part in the high one it is very windy and the whole motorhome moved without emptying of water and filling only for parking and sleeping
15133,172305,4,Ben79,12/08/2017,Ideal place to spend a night. We stayed in the parking lot above; Even the GC was there taking some photos of the views and didn't tell us anything.
15133,166436,4,Daire,05/08/2017,"It is a quiet place to spend the night. There are posters forbidding overnight stays and motor homes, but while we passed the Civil Guard and did not say anything even though there were several ACs."
15133,160852,4,pepe2484,29/07/2017,"In principle you can not stay overnight, but we had no problem. The fountain in the town square did not work and the laundries were very neglected."
15133,144560,2,jerovega7,21/06/2017,"After a few years, we found that the municipality has not done anything to improve the camping area, for motor homes, we are an important part for the income of La Isleta, if we add that the beach is made foxes, no longer have the interest than in times past."
15133,142913,4,Eeoodares,13/06/2017,A lovely location just outside a great village. Signs saying no overnight parking. Nobody seemed too bothered. Nice and peaceful.
15133,138210,5,RosaVergara,27/05/2017,"It's great to sleep there! Of course, the guy at the diving center tells me that it is only allowed to sleep in the upper parking lot even though all the motorhomes are in the lower one."

Not been moved and there are approx 50 other motorhomes here. Its your decision or risk you may get a large fine. The town is very nice and small with Restraunts and a small supermarket. Its a long way out to get a ticket......
15133,116527,4,mirabelle9,23/12/2016,"It's finish. From now on, motorhomes are prohibited, due to a protected national park. Severe fine. It's sad and stupid. We will find other nice little spots elsewhere."
15133,108878,4,vevedol35,05/10/2016,Good for the day but a guard arrived at 8 p.m. He told us that it was forbidden at night and to go and settle in the village.
15133,104901,4,Jamesdean95,12/09/2016,"Well placed for visiting the village and accessing the beaches, practically full on this beautiful Sunday in September"
15133,104154,5,Robertocampo,10/09/2016,"Very nice place. Ideal for passing through and stopping to sleep. Despite there being a sign prohibiting overnight stays, I think they don't cause problems since there is always a motorhome and/or camper. It has garbage containers but it does not have water or other services. The beach has 1 shower at one end and very nice bottoms in the corners for snorkeling."
15133,101553,4,Javilon,30/08/2016,"Ideal beach for children. We just spent the day. It was a windless day, so very good."

Pas de parking du crépuscule jusqu'à l'aube. whenever possible. A night we slept on a street in the village. // Wonderful, right on the beach, full of cars and campers. No services, only garbage containers. Parking is prohibited from dusk to dawn. Possible fine. One night we were given environmental protection and we slept on a street in the town. Two other nights we risked sleeping and were not fined."
15133,63266,5,mirabelle9,04/02/2016,"Let's not be surprised to get fired. (yesterday at 8 pm) Morning parade buckets at the water tap. By cons, I see motorhomes sucking for a long time. Or empty their toilet. I let you guess for me, I alternate between the campsite and the parking."
15133,60748,5,mick38,07/12/2015,"Superb in December we spent several nights there. Be careful all the cabo gata park is forbidden at night. For the weekend of 4 days of 5, 6, 7, 8 December in front of the influx of Spaniards the park guards came to hunt us, then it was the Guarda Civil. We ended up in an abandoned urbanization. They are nice and do not put fine"
15133,51932,3,gon943,24/08/2015,"As Ester says (beautiful!) There are illegal and discriminatory signs of motorhome prohibition, I have seen some erased by black sprais. The place is not bad to spend some night."
15133,50646,5,ester,19/08/2015,"No problem spending the night, even with the motorhome prohibition plate. He has been coming for 2 years in August in different fortnights and I see the civil guard passing by and they have not told us anything. Beach full of families. 5 stars"

15133,39706,4,margriet,23/06/2015,"Wasteland next to a charming village. No facilities and few horizontal areas, but an amazing view."
15133,31042,3,Pierre,11/02/2015,"Good but situation in zone of the natural park with numerous signs of prohibition to the motorhomes. A local passer-by tells us that park wardens pass from time to time. We decided to stay but are in fear of being evacuated. Very windy (north). Small fishing village little inhabited. Return to the same comment: manu-militari transfers. We spent the night on a parking lot at the top of the village (towards the watchtower) sheltered from the wind. So nobody in the corner and no customers in the restaurant. As for the protected area I have trouble understanding, especially on the roadside, in an urbanized area and in the middle of the waste."
15133,30816,4,trafdo,26/01/2015,There is a free shower right off the beach next to the stairs. // Hay una ducha gratis to the derecha de la playa junto to the escalera.

15163,377052,1,Borgy,18/09/2018,"We have arrived at 23:00, it is a place where they come to smoke joints, couples, a place not sure ... we will not stay here or crazy! The beautiful views, the only thing that is worth it."

The road to it is steep and windy but buses manage to do it.
15163,223905,4,Stigeon,21/02/2018,"Amazing place. Spend the last 4 nights there without seeing any other van or camper. Pretty quiet. Ok, some young kids smoking and having fun, but nothing to worry about."

15163,133590,1,koumbaia,07/05/2017,"Access not recommended for long vehicles, heavy, or having trouble in the climbs: my motorhome almost stopped in the climb while it was in first! Hairpin turns, narrow streets in one direction, descent prohibited vehicles over 5 m long, cars parked on both sides ... and on arrival, a place very (and very badly) frequented! Despite everything, a magnificent view!"
15163,84435,4,balooTEiV,23/07/2016,We stayed here on our way back from our trip 15 days apart. We had no problem. The view of Barcelona is magnificent. It is clear that the bottom of the neighborhood is not very reassuring but it is much cooler than other places in Barcelona.

15163,24421,3,reivax,26/08/2014,Great view of Barcelona. Warning easy access back / return by Roquetes. The place does not inspire tranquility for the night but it's just my opinion. Your turn to judge.
15169,723860,3,joelle91,17/10/2019,"Large car park, clean, almost flat. Beautiful panorama. Near a village hall, however, we are alone on Thursday, October 17th. This tranquility is very rare in Portugal."

Bar and restaurant with friendly staff and some shops with local products. Resto closes at 6pm. No services."
15170,2948108,5,oranjebusje,10/07/2023,The place is magnificent. But we were sent away by the police. They referred us to a campsite nearby or a camper place outside the nature park. Unfortunately!!!!

down to Vide is 20km primarily 12 % going down. our clutch and brakes over cooked. old van but every component is new... so other way to Covilha is way easier. and also more beautiful"
15170,2823165,5,nathalia22,05/06/2023,"What an incredible experience! It is really worth visiting Serra da Estrela! It's fantastic! We recommend going up through the city of Covilhã, as the Loriga road is very steep, so we only went down it. We slept 1 night, in front of the chapel, very silent. In the morning, the GNR knocked on the door and said that he could not sleep there. A feather! Perhaps by talking to them beforehand, they'll authorize you to spend the night."
15170,2787026,4,KaKeMi,26/05/2023,Brilliant spot with a great 360 view. Nickel network. We are on the west side with a magnificent sunset. We were with another van. Super quiet. No service but I recommend taking a little trip to the small supermarket to buy cheese and ham. The ladies are adorable.

15170,2512097,4,imnotjoao,03/12/2022,"Arrived during the night, some narrow roads after we arrived to this place. Not easy to find a flat Space but the best seems to be on the west side of the house between the towers. Smooth night and in the morning the park was full (It was an holiday).

All is the mountain, is super safe no crime around! You can park anywhere in Serra da Estrela. More people in winter than in summer. Nice place for one day. If windy go behind the buildings. The police is super nice they all look like olímpic atlhelets, because they are special mountain police, very well equipped. Good place for any caravan."

Stayed the night and it was quiet and there was a great sunset (the fog cleared up), was windy during the night but we parked around the rear and sheltered best we could by the buildings."

15170,190079,4,vlisa,05/09/2017,The ski resort is quickly forgotten (except winter season). Few attendance this season on Mount Torre. Sunset and beautiful sunrise. Starry night on the roof of continental Portugal!
15170,130497,1,8usti,23/04/2017,"The site lacks magic; dusty parking and with uneven, excessive people and very dirty. Old facilities of the GNR and the only ski resort in Portugal. Maybe in winter and with snow it has more appeal. There are places where you spend the night in La Serra da Estrella infinitely better."

When you tell him that you don't want the plot because of those limitations, he tells you (he hopes that I'm looking for a better one, hayyy if I have one that you can stay until noon) you go in to spend the night and you see that it is half empty. If you want bread or pasta for breakfast in the little shop, you can't, you have to reserve it the day before. Good cleaning and it is cared for."

This place is spotlessly clean, incredibly quiet, it has all the facilities you need and is just wonderful. We will definitely be revisiting here, no question about it. 
The site has a lightly stocked very reasonably priced shop and you can order bread, croissants and pain au chocolat. Two restaurants nearby and that’s pretty much it."

15313,3186904,2,patriziazoe,20/08/2023,"Quiet place but it was a bit expensive for what it offers, plus you have to pay more to have access to the pool. nice bar restaurant but the kitchen is not optimal. We have paid for 3 nights, but the next day we ran away due to the staggering amount of flies. impossible to stay"
15313,3178999,5,elodie33,19/08/2023,"Very nice campsite, maintained, clean and quiet. Impeccable toilets. Shaded and well marked out pitches. However, provide wedges because it is a little sloping. We recommend the restaurant which is very good. Detour to do!"

New and very clean facilities. A nice bar and a very nice swimming pool, which can only be used for a daily fee.....(a choice that I personally don't agree with)."
15313,3086878,3,Alexander75,06/08/2023,"Expensive camping for what it offers, since you have to pay separately for the pool. Very appropriate to spend a few days of tranquility. Large and not very delimited pitches... The showers and sinks are very good and very clean."
15313,3077690,5,schreiberx,04/08/2023,"Wonderful campsite with very friendly staff.
The restaurant is excellent (for a camper restaurant) and the swimming pool allows you to cool down.
We just wanted to stop here for the night and then decided to stay longer."
15313,2995450,5,VeravdDungen,21/07/2023,"beautiful campsite. very luxurious sanitary facilities. There is a swimming pool for which you still have to pay an entrance fee! quite pricey but for that you get music in the toilet. will be neatly guided around the campsite, after which you can choose a place yourself. 5 persons 50 euros per night!"
15313,2838918,5,tovv,10/06/2023,"Very quiet campsite. The sanitary facilities are very clean and well maintained. Dogs are welcome. The staff is extremely friendly. The restaurant is small, lovingly furnished and incredibly good for seclusion. It is recommended to reserve in the restaurant."

15313,2802189,5,SethBulli,30/05/2023,Due to the terracing there are some cozy places that you can choose yourself. Very nicely situated in nature. The night was very quiet; no annoying barking of dogs!
15313,2758051,5,judith1521,17/05/2023,Loved this campsite. The pitches are random and terraced but are flat and of a good size. We arrived and the sign said full but the owner couldn’t do enough to help us find a suitable place for a small van. Bar and restaurant were open and bread was available to order. Great place for walking and cycling we did a 20km walk from the site on PR 15. Would definitely recommend
15313,2755214,2,Helou29,16/05/2023,"Disappointed! Home average managers. No well-defined places, placement at their discretion. A bit of a mess. Not very well maintained except around the pool. Campsite far from everything, 0 hiking trails from the campsite. Positive: recent sanitary facilities, well equipped, clean and heated. Helpful restaurant staff (1 lady speaks French). We regretted not having spent the night at the Bragança area."
15313,2753534,5,ja50n0,16/05/2023,"really nice place, very clean and well maintained facilities, great pool and lovely hot showers. pitches are perfect for VW campers, bigger vans and MH's are here, they seem to be happy with the space. Nice views and very quiet at night. Stayed here for 2 nights, VW camper with 2 adults €38 in May 23 with ACSI"

15313,2713852,3,nowrongturn,01/05/2023,"Could be a fantastic site but the pricing is too high- even with ACSI paying so much for one extra dog is crazy. In a 6M van I still needed to use wedges and the numbered pitches are very narrow but long - tried 3 before I could get one in reach of power. I paid €22.95, 1 person 2 dogs with power. Will try to add price list photo"
15313,2622125,3,RainbowUnicorn,24/03/2023,"Looks lovely but we thought it was €10 a night according to this posting but we would have to pay €30,50 per night for a camper, 2 persons, 2 dogs and electric. We updated the prices according to their pricing today."
15313,2602172,5,MelInAVan,07/03/2023,I spent 1 very quiet night there. The landscape is very pretty. The toilets are clean. The welcome is rather warm. I paid 14€ for a van and electricity. I recommend !
15313,2600820,4,SusanneBrunner,06/03/2023,A nice quiet place completely in nature. Sanitary are clean. The individual pitches are uneven and soft when it rains
15313,2466957,3,Leeni7,28/10/2022,"Great campsite, separate pitches, nice operators, great sanitary facilities. We were almost alone here. In the low season 2 people and dog without electricity 19 euros. 15 euros for a 9kg laundry is too much."
15313,2461547,4,Jess1710,25/10/2022,very pretty campsite in nature welcoming staff toilets at the top but to do the dishes cold water too bad. earthy ground in very calm rainy weather for 1 night 2 adults 1 child 1 dog 26€60
15313,2354280,4,ahsturm,09/09/2022,"Very nicely located campsite in the nature park, super friendly reception, ACSI is accepted, sanitary facilities are super clean. Make a reservation in the restaurant for the evening, the regional menu is highly recommended, but you have to be really hungry. Much nicer than the WoMo pitch directly in Braganca, it was way too crowded there."
15313,2336907,5,WoodWorks,04/09/2022,"Beautiful campsite, very clean sanitary facilities and very nice places to stand. It was nice and quiet, we really enjoyed it here. Very highly recommended to stay here. ☺️"

The GR are too far to go on foot, we try short walks in the woods. Otherwise very curious pitches in espaliers no levels otherwise a bric a brac down there stuck to each other! Clean toilets but without toilet paper, too bad for a 4*"
15313,2304114,4,PR46,26/08/2022,"Very good park with excellent shades, very friendly service by the staff, clean bathrooms and with the necessary conditions. Points to improve: The prices for the swimming pool are expensive and should be included in the price, the dirty water discharge areas are very bad to empty the dirty water, very small sewer with difficult access for motorhomes."
15313,2278866,5,carogossart,21/08/2022,"We loved our stay at this campsite! Everything was top: location, sanitary, swimming pool, games for children. Only downside is the restaurant we were going to for pizzas but out of pizzas that night :("

15313,2228915,4,Jean-Michel77,13/08/2022,"Very clean toilets. Pool optional, but still expensive. The pitches are small on the hill part but we preferred that to the flat part where the pitch is free. The paths were under construction during our stay, so noise from the opening of the campsite. You can order bread for the next day, it's great. A person at the reception speaks French, the young people do not."
15313,2211972,4,FamilleInalti,10/08/2022,campsite well placed in the park with beautiful walks or mountain bike rides. Free pitches on land or small spaces (40 spaces). The pool at the top well maintained. concerning the restoration we have not tested because full or service closed for lunch .. The toilets and showers are clean.
15313,2187611,4,Larryrose,06/08/2022,"First stop being a motorhome and highly recommended. at night you only hear the trees. The pool has beautiful views of the mountains. Pretty dry waitress. The boy is very nice. Sign not very flat where we parked (I understand that due to the hazing of being new to these issues), but I saw the lower part more straight. BBQ site and clean restrooms. The arrival is easy (6m)"
15313,2178345,4,Alex56450,05/08/2022,we were very disappointed. plots not so big but above all very very dusty !! Sanitary areas not great: dilapidated at the level for washing dishes and linen. no hot water in some showers. nice pool good for one night
15313,2174397,3,Pcouto71,04/08/2022,"We came in August with high expectations but we were a little disappointed, the plots are not pleasant (little shade), very dusty, depending on the plot chosen, access to electricity can be complicated, on the other hand, the spas are modern, well equipped and extremely clean. too bad they only have 2 shower cabins with hot water, the pool is nice but you have to pay..."
15313,2159427,5,jeff60,01/08/2022,"Very pleasant campsite, on a level with small friendly pitches. A large square in the center can accommodate the largest cc for one night. Very good restaurant.

15313,2082526,5,Didsky,16/07/2022,"One of the most beautiful and well-maintained small campsites that we have come across, for a very reasonable price. Swimming pool is extra to pay but definitely worth it. Beautiful surroundings, in the middle of the Montesinhos Natural Park, where chestnuts are also grown. El Cepo Verde has very friendly owners who are happy to explain walks, and there is good food (and drinks!)"
15313,2071210,5,tommes1964,14/07/2022,"Nice place in the mountains, terraced pitches, very clean. Swimming pool available. A bit pricey, but worth every euro."
15313,1978749,4,sybenirisonatrip,15/06/2022,"Beautiful places, good and clean sanitary facilities. Still 1 star off: No toilet paper, no hot water to wash dishes and extra costs will be charged for the pool. Based on the description above, we wanted pizza, but they don't serve it every day. The resturant was ok. The homemade pie was great."
15313,1977458,3,RemyAndMe,14/06/2022,"Nice place with lots of shade, but please check the bill, I was billed too much."
15313,1974835,4,gp38,13/06/2022,I take off 1 star because of the restaurant which is far from corresponding to what it claims: a very (too) extensive menu that they are not able to serve in full and the dish they serve you only looks like far to what you ordered. Conclusion: 5/5 for the campsite and its sanitary facilities and 1/5 for the restaurant.
15313,1961297,4,samsarabim,09/06/2022,"Nice place, sanitary facilities are new and clean. Nice barbecue area, but all in all not a highlight: Quite full, you are sometimes close to other campers/tents. Unfortunately we arrived late but were still able to find a place. No washing machine but laundry service including drying for 15 € was too expensive for us."
15313,1928968,3,GFbusje12,29/05/2022,"The campsite is beautiful, but the owner placed us near a couple of very large campers on the lower field. It was very messy and crowded. If you can stand on top of one of the terraces with a bus camper, it is ok."
15313,1926213,5,meitocamping,28/05/2022,"Very nice campsite, with shaded pitches on terraces or on a large square. Shims may be required on some locations. Modern and very clean toilets. The restaurant, with prior reservation, recommended, especially for its hearty regional menu at €23.50. Services available. Only downside, the poorly designed location for emptying gray water."
15313,1923107,4,skurl,28/05/2022,Terraced campsite in the woods. All clean. Nice restaurant (reserve on arrival).
15313,1888894,3,Lachaume86,14/05/2022,Very friendly and accommodating welcome to assign us a place for a night in a van. But the pitches are steep and poorly accessible. Clean toilets.

15313,1879317,5,chachaaure,09/05/2022,"Very nice campsite in the heart of the natural park, very quiet. Modern and clean infrastructure. We paid 18euros for one night in a motorhome with two adults and a dog (without electricity)."
15313,1834309,3,mabreizh56,18/04/2022,"Bof!!... I am much less enthusiastic than others.... The pitches are not terrible...and the campsite is very steep, not well maintained. Very positive point, the brand new sanitary facilities, hyper modern and functional. Wi-Fi networks do not pass. You have to take CepoVerde at 3.5o€ for 3d mini and it doesn't work everywhere!!... Price 12.25€/d"
15313,1834053,5,MTDO,18/04/2022,"Lovely campsite with friendly owner. Facilities are good. Pool a bit cool but refreshing. Good for biking through pretty, small and old villages. Enjoyed it a lot!"
15313,1830261,4,KangooroGZ,17/04/2022,An excellent camping area. Beautiful location for routes through the Natural Park. Very friendly staff and a good price. Perhaps the best thing would be to have hand soap available in the bathrooms. An excellent place. Thanks Green Stump!
15313,1808877,5,VictorToni,06/04/2022,"Great place, we went out of season. A camperized van, 2 people, and 2 dogs about €15 per day. Bathrooms/showers very clean, the setting is beautiful."
15313,1783557,5,MelonHay,14/03/2022,Well maintained small campsite on the edge of Parque Natural de Montesinho. Access from the north is along beautiful narrow windy roads but with little traffic we newbies managed in our 8.2m Motorhome! Restaurant serves delicious local dishes and wines. Very friendly welcome with English speaking hosts. Walking possible in Parque from site.
15313,1782400,5,Bellyman01,13/03/2022,"One of the best places in Portugal. Well maintained but still rustic. New very clean sanitary facilities. Level pitches. Bar, restaurant and bread service. Nice staff (operators?) Also open in March."

15313,1630734,5,Combilove,07/10/2021,"Top campsite in a natural site, very quiet. New sanitary facilities, large, super clean (I love Portuguese music playing). Delicious restaurant (reservation required) boss and staff at the top, speaking French and English. Hiking in the surrounding villages, the boss can advise you. Nearby village of Vilarinho where you can buy excellent, award-winning honeys. I recommend this campsite"
15313,1629560,5,natxoykeren,06/10/2021,"Good camping. Large pitches for campers. We went with a dog and no problem. Clean bathrooms, although they do not have soap or paper. Individual showers. The restaurant closes at 20:30, they give dinners by booking, but in low season if you arrive before closing time you can have dinner or order take away. It has a swimming pool and a park. A pleasant stay."

15313,1560572,5,InesVicencio,08/09/2021,"We stayed for two nights in August at this campsite, with terraces, very well framed in the landscape. We liked the facilities, cleanliness, service, dinner in the restaurant (we booked in advance) and the silence during the night."
15313,1558071,5,babesadventure,08/09/2021,It was a very nice campsite with a magic view. super clean toilets and shower!
15313,1531075,5,MuriDC,30/08/2021,"Relax camping. We took a shady square, we were even cold so we had a great sleep. We pay € 14.85 / day. Showers and toilets included and mega clean (you have to use your own toilet paper) but the facilities are extremely comfortable. It has a bar with food (you have to reserve). Large pool (closes at 8pm) and you pay € 3 / day. Electricity is also paid separately. Site for draining water and recharging"
15313,1516498,5,LiaPereira,26/08/2021,"[EN] For tents (we don't ask for electricity). Very recommendable: friendliness, cleanliness, good infrastructure for washing dishes and clothes and a very good atmosphere. The campsite is beautiful. The tents are arranged along small terraces with many oaks, respecting the natural slope."
15313,1504347,5,alex64600,23/08/2021,"A pretty campsite in the middle of greenery. Very pleasant place, family-friendly, very clean toilets and very nice staff. The campsite restaurant is also to be recommended, the food is very good for a very reasonable price. The very well maintained swimming pool is also a plus."
15313,1482391,5,lisalvador,19/08/2021,"Extraordinary cleaning of toilets and showers. The park has a lot of shade, due to the amount of trees it has (chestnut and cherry trees) and preserves the natural aspect of the Montesinho Natural Park."
15313,1456601,5,Reef77,14/08/2021,"Has to be one of the best camp sites in Portugal. Lots of shade to avoid 38C heat, perfect pool, perfect bathrooms. Organised. Cheap. Amazing view of valley. Close to Bragança.

Remember to post your comments when you park for a night so we all learn from each other. Remember to respect the environment & local communities because we all create a reputation for one another."
15313,1454899,5,vwafrica,14/08/2021,"Excellent campsite with swimming pool (super appreciated after a day of driving and 40 degrees!). Pleasantly nestled in a green area, therefore shaded and relatively cool in summer. 32 € for 3 people, a van, electricity and access to the swimming pool. We will return. We recommend 100%."
15313,1406266,5,durendal1936,04/08/2021,"Beautiful campsite with all amenities (except a washing machine). Nice places, fantastic view, lovely pool and playground.

15313,1307180,4,MorueFamily,08/07/2021,"Very nice campsite with quality pitches but above all of variable size. Big downside: the very high price, accumulation of options ... example: 1 washing machine for 10 euros ... we had a good time with the children, everything is very clean."
15313,1219813,3,GerbenR,26/05/2021,"If money for service does not matter and you can have a spot with a nice view, its the perfect place. I think they charge much (even in low season) for what they give. We paid 17€ without electricity. 2,5€ for each dog (3,8 in high season?!). There is no toilet papier in the toilet."
15313,1215153,5,ninafa,24/05/2021,"This campsite is small and beautiful. There is plenty of space, a fire pit, a stone oven, swimming pool. The sanitary facilities are modern and very clean. Dogs are allowed, it is quiet at night. The staff is very friendly and the campsite's small restaurant is highly recommended, especially the chocolate mousse! You can go cycling well and it is a 15-minute drive to town (Braganca), where there is a laundromat (Lavandaria Americana) and a large Lidl. The castle is worth a visit. We would come back anytime, it was very nice here!"
15313,1032703,4,Naturuchi,07/09/2020,"The toilets are spectacular and very clean, it also has a swimming pool with a very nice lawn. It has a bar and they even offer dinner. However, you have to pay for the WIFI and it only reaches 10-15m from the reception."
15313,1024385,4,Maraise,04/09/2020,"Beautiful campsite, super quiet at the end of August. I did have one of the better places with a view over the mountains. The only downside is that you have to pay separately for all facilities. So I paid € 3 for 1 dive of 5 min in the pool. Furthermore, very nice!"
15313,897376,2,Andoni.G,25/07/2020,"The places for the motorhomes are not flat and if you get the 3, be dead! it is on a slope and you don't even put it straight with chocks! The truth is that we did not like the pool apart! but otherwise it's very clean"

15313,791532,4,RolloFC,05/03/2020,"Price: 20 € the night. Electricity and Water. We (young couple) travel with a dog in a caravan. A beautiful campsite with a special flair. To explore the area around Braganza, I can recommend this place. Due to the current weather, it is a bit muddy on the lawns. But there are also gravel places. To get to the place you have to go down the paved road for about 200m with an 8-10% gradient and then up again. It can get tight in oncoming traffic. No toilet paper on the modern and clean sanitary facilities."
15313,656850,4,joc85,24/08/2019,"So there are some comments that are not just a camping your own sanitary clean and welcome your sympathy for our taste by tale prices should be updated on Park4night because it is not 10 € but 18,35 €"
15313,637136,3,Bernie64,17/08/2019,"Quite disappointed by this campsite. Disparate locations from worst to best. 3 toilets for each sex, really undersized compared to the size of the campsite, not to mention the queues for showers. Washing machine 5 € and made wet which is very expensive. Paying pool, a little thought to families who come with 2, 3 or more children, making the stay quite expensive. Electrical connection to the limits of safety (passage of extensions in the stairs). Warm water or cold for the dishes. Otherwise nice staff, some more friendly than others but good overall. Resto no more, but good. Good for a stopover, not for a stay."
15313,620885,2,Lisou35,12/08/2019,"Friendly welcome and very pleasant staff. We regret the number of sanitary / shower undersized compared to the capacity of reception. Lack of cleanliness. We were disappointed with the location, which was really small for our motorhome. Arrive early in the afternoon for a better choice. The restaurant was nice with a map adapted."
15313,618471,5,astropa,11/08/2019,"Very nice campsite, quiet, clean, in the heart of the park. but be careful not very flat terrain. the restaurant on the other hand we were disappointed (very few choices, average pizza)."
15313,616723,3,malibert,10/08/2019,"Good: the staff is very friendly and helpful. The food in the restaurant is great! The price is absolutely fine: 55 EUR for 3 nights, 2 people, AC, electricity in high season. Bad: sanitary facilities were cleaned too rarely, rubbish too rarely emptied. The showers rarely have hot water and the water pressure is worse than in the RV - on the third day the showers were dirty, stank of urine, and the water was freezing cold that I showered in the camper."
15313,610576,5,amtrafic,08/08/2019,"Very pleasant campsite. Unmarked pitches, clean toilets, accommodating staff, good and inexpensive snack/bar. We spent 1 night there with a van, 15.60 for 2 with electricity, booked because we arrived quite late. Maybe cheaper on site directly?"

15313,556870,5,Facinas,16/07/2019,This is the second time we have been there. The horizontality is not of great precision a wedge is welcome. We can not have shade trees and a slab on the ground it is necessary that the roots are placed somewhere. Other than that it's super well run. The campsite is not an amusement park and there are never too many people. We enjoyed the soft and portuguese music in the sanitary which is impeccable and .... beautiful. Camping frequented by civilized which is nice and not frequent. Super staff. Nice option to start the tour of northern Portugal.
15313,553016,5,portugesh,14/07/2019,"Beautiful campsite, everything is fine. Located in the countryside, quiet, family. The toilets are clean and pleasant. The services are very good for motorhomes. The staff is very kind. I recommend with eyes closed."

Animation all day for the little ones and a small Chiki park in the restaurant. plots with grass and own sink for washing. The bad is the little cleanliness of the toilets, which is much to be desired below. Buy what is necessary to enter since it does not have a supermarket"

BUT the place is dated. The showers look like they are rarely cleaned, facilities aren't maintained or updated. No shop. Cleanliness of whole site including pools is a concern. Won't be back"

15349,714495,1,Nippers,06/10/2019,"After spending a day in this campsite, we realize that the problem is not the flies (almost impossible to admit within the paranormal) but that the problem is the lack of direction. I explain myself while some of the clients make us comply with the rules (I would say that it is not necessary or indicate what they are) allow the abuse by some clients who believe that everything is valid, even children defecating in common parts (gardens) ... that neither would it be the child's fault there is always a father to pick it up. Voices, disorder ... despite the facilities ... advised against coming. For the price there is camping as well as camping park with better treatment than this."
15349,713722,2,Nippers,05/10/2019,"Camping very cool, but careless. The bathrooms clean them once a week ... besides the weekend we were there came several English caravans that caused a great mess. They didn't say anything to the management."

In December 2017 we paid only 12 €. We will not be back."
15349,393293,5,KMK,14/10/2018,"We liked the camping, it's different. The green plots are very comfortable and spacious, with their own sink. It is true that we have been in October and everything was very calm. The best of all is the Spa, it is tiny but considering that you are inside a campsite, it is a luxury. Maria treated us great! To put a but, you need a car to go to Peñiscola."
15349,307908,4,chekeboo,31/07/2018,"Camping with many resources, spa pools, entertainment for children, restaurant ... shaded well-defined spaces but very far from everything. That's why there are only caravans. Many flies."

During our visit, at the beginning of March, the place was completely occupied (booking days before!). The water available on site is not potable as we were told.

15353,2589686,4,Jane23,24/02/2023,We spent a pleasant week here. With paella eating together at what is probably the longest mobile home table. Thanks to Trini & Juan! The place is not too big and the coast and Murcia can be easily reached by bike. We give one star less because we found the way the toilet paper was disposed of very unpleasant (open trash can). There is a lot of rubbish outside the square.

15480,3280555,4,Guri,10/09/2023,"Very well located area, close to the historic center; There are small and larger spaces where you can park 2 AC/Battery Campers; There is still a lot of incivility in this group, we witnessed a heated discussion: 1 camper did not want to park in a battery and leave space for another user. Let's be more supportive. I don't give 5 stars because the area is shared with cars. We slept the night of September 8"
15480,3277026,5,PauloMerencio,09/09/2023,"Very good service area, with all services available, located in a huge green park, just a few minutes walk from the historic center."
15480,3276872,4,AnaOrtega,09/09/2023,We have come several times to this area near the city center. Curiously this time it seemed to us that there were several fixed Motorhomes. It's September 9th and it's almost full. Thanks to this beautiful city.
15480,3270293,4,yapi37,07/09/2023,"4 stars, area in the city center 15' walk from the historic city.. on the entrance to a park.. must be visited... thank you to the municipality.. be careful not to take out chairs, tables or blinds, it is prohibited in Spain on public areas (500€ if angry police)"
15480,3266586,5,Duri,06/09/2023,"Very good motorhome area. Good accessibility, it has portable toilets that are cleaned frequently and the environment allows for good walks and activities in the area, as well as visiting the city. I stayed several days and would return without hesitation."

15480,3261184,2,MC1960,05/09/2023,"It is an area not very close to the old town. There is a park and games for children. If you are seated at the entrance to the car park it is very very noisy, sports cars or people coming to walk their dogs don't stop until 11 p.m. Personally I don't recommend this area unless you find a place at the back."
15480,3260760,5,CarolCastillo,05/09/2023,"A super quiet place with services that work perfectly, it also has a small park. The location is also very good since a 10/20 minute walk away is the historic center and the main square. There is a supermarket and a pharmacy just 5 minutes walk away. I would return if given the opportunity."

15480,3229309,4,nuskag,28/08/2023,"A great area, but it can't be that small fires park in a line taking up more than one space. We should try to respect and park properly so that we can fit more...."

15480,3219839,2,pedron,26/08/2023,"Thanks to the council for the area, near the center, the downside, which is noisy, due to the roads and the people who come to the park at all hours, that's what parks are for, but incompatible with rest"
15480,3204916,4,UrkoSaez,23/08/2023,"spectacular area with park for children. The only drawback that I put is that it is shared with cars since if we have few places to be able to pecnortar if they are busy I do not know where we are going to go. For the rest, thanks to the town hall for this free and well-maintained area."
15480,3194647,5,JuanCarlosArnanz,21/08/2023,Magnificent area with delimited and flat squares. Near the center. Thank you very much to the town hall.

Too bad, the location is good. The toilets are not maintained, to be avoided."
15480,3165955,4,Fovemove,17/08/2023,"The spot is very good, clean It's not that quiet with the proximity of the road and the late arrivals of the CCs."

Thanks to the town hall for making such a welcoming place for our environment, I hope other town halls take them as an example"
15480,3103983,4,libertadsuarez,08/08/2023,"The place is not very pretty but it is very good.

15480,3074893,5,Patxo22,04/08/2023,"One of the best areas we have visited. Two steps from the center, next to the bike path that borders the city, next to a LUPA and an Alimerka and super quiet (green areas, swings, courts...). Zamora is worth at least a couple of days. Not only cultural visit, but also gastronomic! It has been a pleasure. We thank the City Council for the area because it is not common to be so well received"

15480,3026722,5,Jolleva,26/07/2023,"To visit the old area it is perfect, we were there on the 19th and 20th, the discharge and loading of water is correct, I did not visit the bathrooms so I cannot comment"
15480,3008886,3,bobby29,23/07/2023,"It’s ok maybe for one night. We arrived and left. It seems grubby and not well kept, the toilets were the worst toilets I’ve ever seen."

15480,2925179,5,Pabloldl,05/07/2023,"Excellent place not only to spend the night, but to spend a quiet day. Acceptably clean and well arranged services (with water, toilet paper and hand towel).

15480,2868950,5,GabyundMicha,18/06/2023,"A really beautiful city, great flair. Thank you for the overnight stay. It would be nice if the toilets were left clean... surely it doesn't look like that at your home!"
15480,2868779,5,GerardCM,18/06/2023,"Magnificent area. This is how a council takes care of its city, its shops, bars and restaurants. Other municipalities should follow suit. Thank you very much Zamora!"

A 10 to the Zamora town hall."

15480,2699424,4,ElectroBaer,26/04/2023,"(VW T5) Spent one night in transit, nice place. There was almost no parking space left when I arrived (about 6 o'clock in the evening), so it might be better to come earlier. There were only 2 chemical toilets."
15480,2695779,4,Malvern59,25/04/2023,Spent one night here very busy not many spaces when we arrived. Lovely park area. Handy for Laundry and supermarket

15480,2663131,5,rodarodeta,11/04/2023,"The space itself is very nice, surely this is the reason why it is very crowded. I think it would be reasonable not to have the bathrooms given that they are unhealthy. Also important to me is the relationship between the neighbors and the campers, which is very good and natural, something that will last you."
15480,2654705,5,taniacamarillo,09/04/2023,"Very good area, it was full, I imagine that for Easter, it is next to a very large park and very close to the historic center, highly recommended!"

15480,2638609,4,sabimenendez,04/04/2023,"Very comfortable to visit Zamora. But be careful, it is not a motorhome area, it is a shared car park and we must optimize the spaces. In the central squares there is no space to park in battery but in the exteriors in almost all of them there is room to get into battery.

The only downside, you can hear the cars on the road, but still we have slept very well. We have not recharged or emptied waters, so I did not enter to value it.

15480,221049,5,campero,01/02/2018,"Please always park in batteries...there is plenty of space even for cars over 7 meters in all the rear spaces next to the area. It gives a very very bad image and the neighbors complain and rightly so when a motorhome parks along it occupying 4 or 5 car spaces.....if 10 motorhomes do that, I won't even tell you.....it's a shame because this parking lot is luxury.....let's think about the others...."

Iberdrola emptied at night and treacherously the reservoir up to 11% of its capacity to generate electricity in its turbines at the time of the highest price of electricity in our country. Now a secarral for pure speculation. We had visited it last year and it was heaven. Hopefully he recovers to his previous state. It's a huge shame :-(

15605,3244693,4,furgopepin,01/09/2023,Very economical camping and perfect for visiting Puebla de Sanabria on foot. Walking 5' from the town. A little dusty but we understand that it is due to the passage of summer. We have gone in other times and it is greener. I recommend it.
15605,3244014,2,ikersagarduy,31/08/2023,"Dusty campsite where its years of glory have passed, it is generally in poor condition, it is noticeable that there is a lack of maintenance and care in every corner, old bathrooms and late cleaning leaves much to be desired, so as not to repeat it, a shame since the location It is perfect for visiting the town and even spending a vacation, the price in my opinion is expensive for what it offers."
15605,3237898,5,buschwicketnous,30/08/2023,"Well located campsite, access to the village via a small path.

The bad thing about it is the restaurant, in my life I have seen a more incompetent waiter/owner. Better not to drink a beer, it takes less time going to town on foot."
15605,3163567,4,cheersvanlife,16/08/2023,"We liked the campsite, it has a lot of trees and it is close to the town on foot. The bathrooms are clean and have hot water. We took away one star because to use the pool they require you to wear a bathing cap and you also have to pay an additional €2. 2 adults and a 17-month-old baby (free) in a camper van €15.24/night (VAT included)"
15605,3160310,4,Laxaro,16/08/2023,23/08/13 - We have been 16. Ours was a big plot and it was in the shade for half a day. Near the swimming pool. Very good to get to town. A negative point is that a lot of noise is heard when cars pass through the inner roads.

Unfortunately, the swimming pool was empty and the sanitary facilities were very outdated. Many local permanent campers who were very nice and helpful. The town is cute, walkable and good for eating out."
15605,2886740,1,dolou,24/06/2023,"we thought it would be a nice campsite for a stopover. And very big disappointment!NO SWIMMING POOL!Noise until 1am, between dogs barking and children left to their own devices who scream very loudly without the parents saying anything...and then it's the highway that we hear very well...

15605,2752007,2,furgonetteando,15/05/2023,"Camping well for fixed caravans, the rest of the plots are not well cared for. We wanted to eat something in the bar and they didn't give us because they were with meals on the terrace (there were two tables) but with the dog they don't let you enter the terrace. If we joined, let the dog and go to the terrace if we eat? A shame. Cheap price but I prefer to pay a little more. Everything outdated."

15605,2644116,5,air081,06/04/2023,"Cozy place. The restaurant manager is very nice and attentive. We spent two days in the area and it seemed like a good place to spend the night. It is true that in front there is a parking lot where overnight stays are allowed, but it was very crowded and with many mosquitoes. We prefer to go camping."

15605,2408301,5,loradenda,28/09/2022,"All right. I do not understand the complaints of other users. For the price you can not ask for more. We paid 15 euros for one night in September (a camper and two adults without electricity). Moreover, we plan to repeat in order to get to know the whole area better. The personnel is very friendly."
15605,2377921,4,dayanalale,16/09/2022,"Quiet site. Very nice staff, we had problems with the water intake and they solved it instantly. A shame not to have been able to enjoy the campsite due to the rain."
15605,2364807,4,SivCa,12/09/2022,"Pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the sanitary facilities, good general maintenance of the campsite. Electricity on almost all pitches (we were able to choose where to stand). Reception and restaurant in the same building. Nice staff! 2 people + 1bb (free < 3 years old) in a van with electricity: €20."
15605,2272730,3,5enunafurgo,20/08/2022,It's economic. Small bathrooms for the capacity of the site and not very clean. In our plot there were bottles and remains of food. Large pool (no access without a hat). Broken and dirty playground. Very noisy. Wide and flat plots. The restaurant is very good but to go slowly. We come from Galicia and nothing to do with what we had found there.
15605,2187911,3,marisacaravana,06/08/2022,"Although the campsite is modest, I think that the ones who make it pleasant are the users. There is a lot of noise here but from people who do not know how to speak without shouting and without thinking that there are staff who want to rest. We're on the road and we've gone to rest and we're still waiting for 12 o'clock to get tired. education gentlemen and respect"
15605,2071572,5,VMG79,14/07/2022,I think it's a great value campsite. The area where it is located is very good. Next to the beautiful town. The campsite has a very large swimming pool. Pretty decent toilets. Game's zone. For that price you can't ask for more.
15605,2057463,4,sunny787,10/07/2022,"Were passing through, felt very comfortable. The beautiful place can be reached quickly in 5 minutes on foot. As is almost always the case in Spain, most restaurants only serve dinner from 8/9pm. In the heat, the cool pool was just great. It was just stupid that it seems to be common on the square to listen to loud music whenever you like. This bothered us at night."
15605,1875185,3,kimvdlageweg,07/05/2022,I thought it was quite expensive for what you got. we paid 20 euros for 1 night. We wanted to use the wifi but it was very bad in the restaurant. and then we were redirected to another place but it didn't work there either. The pool was also not open and looked gross. And there was a lot of barking from dogs. We didn't use the showers and toilet so I can't say anything about that
15605,1866900,3,JEAC,02/05/2022,"The campsite is not bad. Improvable showers and bathrooms. The worst accesses, both by car and on foot. Poorly maintained and very dirty, I understand that it is the fault of the city council. There is no right that politicians do not take care of tourism. Very friendly people at the campsite."
15605,1826284,5,Sivi6573,16/04/2022,It is super simple but with everything you need. Wide and flat plots. The shower with super hot water and water pressure. One step away from town. And the people at the reception very friendly.

15605,1363265,3,Freerules,25/07/2021,"Quite abandoned and full of dust that when it rains it is a quagmire. Finding a decent plot with electricity is mission impossible. If you want shade, be careful with the branches of the trees that are not pruned and the AC rubs. the only good thing is that it has a swimming pool and a restaurant. Electrical outlets and a little cleaning are missing."
15605,1316350,4,cuzcurrita,12/07/2021,"Pretty abandoned campsite. Road access to the town, dirty. The city council should take more care of this place."
15605,1070382,4,DoryVigo,26/09/2020,It closes at the end of September. Very nice site. Super large squares and in the middle of trees. Very well priced.
15605,970990,1,LAXIENA,16/08/2020,"It is strange that Puebla de Sanabria is one of the most beautiful towns in Spain and that it has this Camping. Dirt everywhere, completely abandoned plots, broken or non-existent taps. Surely in its day it was a campsite of 10 but currently the state of neglect it has makes it unfortunate. The filling and emptying area is a quagmire ... !!! I have to add that around 1:00 in the morning a group of children of about 10 years started shaking the Motorhome and laughing they woke us up. In the morning we flew like arrows from there."
15605,951860,3,dianagf,11/08/2020,"Very well priced and lots of shade. We took a square without light, 148, and except for the tree roots that made it difficult to level things, it was luxurious next to the river and the exit to the town. Of course, the non-existent WiFi and the emptying area could be more comfortable."
15605,891715,2,Mayi6857,23/07/2020,"Date: July 22, 2020 the campsite is already open and you can use the services, showers, laundries ... A reform does not hurt, for shopping the supermarket is insufficient, absence of recycling containers. The visit to the village with an effortless walk up the slope to reach it is worth it."
15605,858027,1,Lukil,09/07/2020,"As of July 8, 2020 it is closed. An old sign that says: ""closed at the end of the season"" at the entrance."

Sanitation okay, but showers tiny but with no possibility, something off. The place can be reached on a nice, shady footpath and well worth seeing. 20,80 € for two persons, dogs free. Use of washing machine for 3,00 €."

15668,3058580,4,Lupincito2022,01/08/2023,A decent spot to overnight. I got an inexpensive Uber to the ruins at Conímbriga which are definitely worth a visit. You’re also in the car park of the town market so ideal for stocking up on vegetables etc. It wasn’t quiet as it was the town’s free music festival which we went and enjoyed.
15668,3048778,4,J-ERochefort,30/07/2023,"Quiet stopover for one night, no passing car because the location is in a dead end. Little surprise when you wake up: it's market day on Friday (not in the car park, but opposite)."
15668,3045401,4,mtalhao,30/07/2023,"The absence of shadow is the only thing to point out. Quiet and very close to the Po.ro.s museum, which is worth visiting. A repair to the municipality: the drainage of gray water goes to the rainwater network, which it shouldn't. The taps do not have a thread, which requires an accessory. Thank you Condeixa."
15668,3037058,4,danicuenca,28/07/2023,"Space with a large number of seats, although narrow for a large volume. Water collection and deposit of gray and black. Paved and quiet area."

15668,2859891,4,Marycoei,16/06/2023,"Quiet place to spend the night, very quiet, park nearby and museum opposite. Service area for discharging gray water, black water and clean water supply. The faucet to put clean water has no thread, we couldn't get an adapter possible. We improvised to fill it up, it worked but it wasted a lot of water."
15668,2834335,4,TelmoRainha,09/06/2023,Good spot to spend the night
15668,2796389,4,ptcarlospt,28/05/2023,"Several places, it is possible to park a motorhome of more than 7m quietly, despite the spaces being narrow. The water tap is strange, I couldn't fit any of my adapters, I had to use a funnel and bottles to fill it up."
15668,2762917,2,SofiaBN,19/05/2023,"The unloading space is a normal parking space for a car, being small for a 7 meter motorhome. The water tap is not in its best condition and we were unable to supply it. It pours water out, wasting water. All the surrounding parking is large enough for cars, with no specific spaces for large motorhomes."
15668,2748848,5,RadaSarka,14/05/2023,Great spot with services.
15668,2731059,4,JRosa,07/05/2023,"Good space, even for 7m cars. Water and flushes all working. Close to a cafe with delicious traditional Condeixa escarpiada. To not lose."

15668,2612582,3,Peanuts,17/03/2023,"Unfortunately, the parking spaces are suitable for a maximum of 6 m. VE very clean. On Friday mornings there is a market across the street on the large square, which is why it is noisy."
15668,2610156,5,Martukasoto,15/03/2023,"Good place to sleep and quiet, with plenty of parking. There is a bar next door that is quite good for breakfast. It is free to refill water and discharge dirty water, so everything is correct."
15668,2603101,3,ElVeterano,08/03/2023,"Pleasant overnight here but we had to use the wedges. The council workers came with strimmers to cut the grass on the verges, but they held off starting work until 10am. They are at least helping to keep the area looking clean and tidy. Thank you to the town for this"

15668,2564070,4,javeasteve5,30/01/2023,"Spent one Sunday night so as to visit ruins. Very quiet, NO beggar, clean tidy service area. A lot of local AC owners arrived just to empty, no doubt after weekend away. Hard standing, street lighting, very little passing traffic, Good 4G signal, early morning sunshine straight in windscreen drying up condensation. Ideal!"
15668,2554842,3,patou241,18/01/2023,"Parking space rather than area, despite the presence of services. Our CC of 7.2m bikes still passes. The beggar came to see us, we refused, he left without being aggressive."
15668,2550258,1,fan4womo,12/01/2023,"The place is actually not a real parking space for mobile homes, but, in terms of dimensions, for cars. - Warning! Unfortunately I was harassed at the place in the evening by a beggar who THERE, WHEN I WAS JUST STANDING THERE, came to my mobile home and knocked! So I went elsewhere."
15668,2529136,3,familiarebelo,26/12/2022,Wing with free eviction and water services. It is a car park used for motorhomes. Quiet location with coffee and ATM nearby.
15668,2524197,4,emax88,18/12/2022,"Comfortable, quiet parking, with fairly easy services. Only be careful on market days because the square where it takes place is right in front and it won't be so quiet those days. Nearby a ring path for walking near the stream. We spent a quiet night before continuing our journey, we were alone but absolutely safe. Thanks to the municipality!"
15668,2509090,5,Family-Bruynooghe,30/11/2022,"Parking for any type of Campervan next to the Fresh market. We didn't visit the town. We spend the night there on passing through. We were 5 campers, quiet night. Free services, bins, no electricity."

Unfortunately, water refilling was no longer possible because the car was parked at the service station (because of the market). Tap without thread, otherwise everything is tiptop."

Unfortunately, the entire river including the waterfall was without water, which is a pity. We weren't in the ruins, didn't tempt us. The parking lot has space but is very busy, especially on weekends. The main street is very noisy, otherwise it was pleasant at night."
