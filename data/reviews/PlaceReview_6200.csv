79981,2594934,3,FNunes,01/03/2023,A calm and well arranged place. But there is a great danger that the entrance gate is closed after 5 pm if there is an emergency you cannot leave unless the gate is opened for you

The reception forgot to tell us that the local fiesta was to be held next to the camping until 4 in the morning. And since the gates were locked we couldn’t  leave that night. Lesson: before choosing your pitch, ask about local fiestas."
79981,1905419,1,Vivian1985,21/05/2022,Campsite makes a good impression. When we arrived we were told that the price is now 35 euros per night due to an event. You should find out beforehand whether there is an event taking place in the city. Otherwise pretty place.

79981,274867,5,markhadley,25/06/2018,One of the best and also cheapest places that we have stopped. 4.35 Euros for cc 2persons. All facilities are good. There is even a lounge to use. Longer than 7m would be difficult. The vehicle gate is locked evenings 7pm to 9am and weekends lunchtimes. I suggest that you ignore satnav and follow signs once you get to the town.
80005,2439341,5,philpowers,12/10/2022,Very good ... A lot of space and not far from there beach and drinking water is 2mins away. I think that now there is no better in this area.

There were plenty of pitches (2 other campers were parked here) & we were able to get some sleep. We stayed a few more hours until noon, by 11:30 am the place was full of cars from beachgoers (I guess). Probably good for the night, during the day you should free the space for others."

80008,2372710,5,kostarina,15/09/2022,"Great spot for a night or two. We stood here all alone. The police came by but didn't speak to us.

80008,1708076,5,LisaTimothy,11/12/2021,"The road there is not without it, the car should not be too low, otherwise you sit up. 4x4 is certainly helpful, if the ground is wet, otherwise you will have a problem. Fantastic beach! Great quiet night."
80008,1657188,5,RCTEAM,22/10/2021,"Bivouac by the sea, beautiful sunset and sunrise, swimming before the aperitif. A dream spot."
80008,1047806,5,luperco,14/09/2020,Extraordinary cove of the irons. To spend the day and spend the night. You have to go down the dirt road but it is accessible.
80008,683053,3,c.fabrizio,09/09/2019,"The place not too bad, feet in the water. On the negative side we did not feel safe, many 4x4 car passages and he looks at you so that you understand that you are not welcome (our feeling) so we preferred to leave the place after dark."

80027,3252776,4,xaliki21,03/09/2023,Nice place to spend the night and day as many say. It is easy to access and flat to sleep on. The only negative and that's why we don't give it 5 stars is the garbage everywhere. We must take care of nature and always try to leave the places even better than we found them. Diablo's throat a spectacle! We will be back.
80027,3151646,5,MoisesM,15/08/2023,"Good parking to spend day and night, we stayed here for 3 nights and no problem, the Devil's Waterfalls are right next door and you can take a nice bath.

We spent a couple of nights... very close to the Devil's waterfall that he arranged for us this summer because we were able to cool off since the river pool had no water. The town and its historic center are worth visiting. It has a bike lane to access the town either on foot or by bike. The worst hornets!! many and impressive
80027,1993541,4,Fernandogil,20/06/2022,For one night it's fine. There are only garbage cans and three picnic tables. Ideal place to visit the waterfall
80027,1734835,3,Juanangarcia,16/01/2022,"Nice place to spend the day. We were going to spend the night too but in the end we left because some dogs from the house were next to us and they wouldn't stop barking, plus the place didn't give us the confidence to sleep there. To spend the day is perfect"
80027,1723810,5,VILNARJA,02/01/2022,"Good place to spend the day or spend the night, out of season somewhat lonely and very dark, even so it is divine. and the devil's waterfall a few meters away."

80042,1872336,5,t6walter,06/05/2022,This is no longer a campsite. But a nomadland bubble hotel. Sleep in a transparent bubble. Beautiful by starlight. But of course much more expensive than camping.
80042,1317384,1,killintime,12/07/2021,Don't both wasting your time you drive down sandy bumpy track and even though it is empty they have no spaces and you can't park there for couple hours even offered money just to have a shower there but totally got refused would never return here wasted time getting here shame as it seems it could have been good
80042,498751,1,Spaniensille,31/05/2019,"Disappointment ... Directions to the campsite goes over a gravel road ... the place was totally empty ... no food, the pool was empty, it looked very run down ... the gate was closed, although it was open .. You do not have to do this journey"

80070,1550905,5,javier2f,05/09/2021,"The access to this area has a particularity and it is that it has two speed bumps, the first of them higher, which conditions the vehicle that you are going through, we pass without any problem, but if we look at it so as not to rub, the area is precious, it does not have coverage and it does not have service either. otherwise I would recommend it"

80075,2248052,3,Joselelatele,16/08/2022,Quiet place although with some noise from the highway and some planes. There were quite a few mosquitoes though. In general we have slept well.

80104,747850,1,rjanis14,28/11/2019,Be careful that night we almost stole our bikes around 6:00. on the other hand our English neighbors had their electric bike stolen. I do not advise using this judgment.
80104,564684,1,Escarabello,20/07/2019,"Very bad night atmosphere. I would not recommend it, people sleeping on the floor little sense of security. I would recommend better the parking of the soccer field."
80104,543233,4,27Cebiches27,07/07/2019,Parking with very high ceilings and trees with large glasses perfect for stays in hot hours. Step without overnight (does not seem very safe for that purpose)
80104,484697,3,edmond69,15/05/2019,Good place to park and visit the city
80104,463901,4,maintresas,22/04/2019,"We have been many times, spending night and day and very well is near the center and now in this time they do many events here in Els camps elisis. As always and everywhere, we are exposed to theft, I encourage you to visit Lleida will give you many surprises."
80104,395154,3,Schanet12,18/10/2018,"Arrived at 4 pm Quiet night. Several rounds of policemen until very late. Comings and goings, no fear. The locals tell me, it's quiet. Right next to the covered market and 5 minutes from the tourist and shopping center. Easily accessible King's Cathedral and Castle for 360-degree panoramic views."
80104,393192,1,sherketa,14/10/2018,"We were looking for a place to park the motorhome while visiting the city during the day, and the Guardia Urbana itself advised against parking here because of the risk of theft."
80104,391741,1,jscfn,11/10/2018,"I do not recommend at all. We arrived to sleep and found it very unsafe, movement of strange people, cars doing weird stuff ... as it was late we opted to park in the main. Generally, it is not easy to sleep. I have registered in the app only to warn that it is not a good option."
80104,338137,1,Imher,16/08/2018,We have gone with the intention of sleeping and we have left. There was no AC in the middle of August. I do not recommend it.
80104,314619,1,Loky34,04/08/2018,"Parking squatted at night, mattresses on the ground etc ... We left Lleda because the other parking next more secure to the train ... We went to the one with the pool next to Lerida in a small village"
80104,302594,2,nad.dacosta,27/07/2018,Very good during the day to visit Lerida. But there are small groups of homeless people sleeping in their cars and we have not taken the risk of staying at night because of the probable noise.
80104,291681,4,oscaroli,17/07/2018,"Trota, you went to run into the new generation of urban that are not characterized by their sympathy (have to have very bad digestion), that I know there is no municipal regulation that prohibits parking throughout the city, in fact I see many here. La Seu vella, is one of the most spectacular castles in Catalonia and the bar, if it is a bit expensive, but the best located in the city"
80115,3197932,5,jerome6769,22/08/2023,"Thanks to the municipality for the welcome. large, very accessible parking lot. Lots of shade. Perfect for visiting the castle and the medieval city. Be careful during the month of August medieval festival with a lot of people from 5 p.m."
80115,3061505,5,aurel,02/08/2023,perfect parking for visiting the city. shady. not a lot of space. lunch break only
80115,2857834,5,EspritsEnLiberte,15/06/2023,"Perfect for visiting the city, we took the length because there were plenty of places (L3H2). Very quiet, only locals."
80115,2433055,4,werner78073,09/10/2022,7.5m without problems. Sundays and almost no vehicles
80115,2211344,5,dieclaudi,10/08/2022,"perfectly parked under trees, 5 minutes walk to the castello, lots of space, recommended as a day parking!"
80115,2138170,5,VinceScholl,28/07/2022,"Top parking lot to spend the day in Silves. The castle can be reached in 5 minutes on foot, after the trip you can go shopping at Aldi. Also suitable for larger mobile homes!"
80115,1900319,3,SiggSigg,19/05/2022,"Overnight stay without problems, very quiet and right next to Aldi. A few dog owners in the evening, otherwise all very peaceful and relaxed. Suitable for a night or two to see Silves. There are also two official pitches nearby. Both in the blazing sun, both without a toilet... and that is one of the main reasons for us to pay money. We'd love to come back."
80115,1228606,5,annapanades,31/05/2021,Perfect location to visit Silves castle and town during the day. Not possible to stay from 8 PM to 8 AM.
80115,992782,4,inigosuspe,22/08/2020,Excellent parkin to visit the castle and the town.
80115,828905,5,arkkas,19/06/2020,"The 2 CC areas being closed, I stayed in this parking lot for 3 nights without being disturbed. Yes, there are some young people who come in the evening by car and who make little noise ... we are in a parking lot, we have to accept others. Shade under the trees that line the paths. The large neighboring median is free to access in normal times when parking is prohibited."
80115,614069,4,mickeygti@yahoo.fr,10/08/2019,"The area next door being closed we stayed there, there was 3 car. A bit noisy a car down so a tow truck came, two young cyclists who made 15 laps of the parking shouting and then the departure of the few cars that were parked there. If not near the castle, the store next door seems to have put the key under the door. We wanted to take a little water in the cemetery but the goalkeeper did not have the air apreciated and mumbling things in Portuguese that we did not understand, so I filled my second jerrycans of 10 liters and am left."
80115,430373,3,Treasurebox,17/02/2019,All the Aires were full the weekend of the Orange Festival so we parked here for daytime only. Easy walking distance to the town and river area. A large paved area without services (though bins nearby). No height or length limitations. Most spaces have at least partial shade from trees. GNR passed by on horses.
80181,3118989,5,Raulana,11/08/2023,"Free at night. Hours from 10 to 19 you pay for 4 hours 4.80 is perfect since it is right at the entrance to the bathrooms. You have to arrive or at night especially if your car is big or before 9 because it fills up very quickly. There is a bathroom and garbage. It is important to get a ticket for the bathrooms online, price 3.5 per person. The enclosure is super well conditioned with a bar and toilet."
80181,2869730,4,BertoS,19/06/2023,"paid parking during the day 09-20, 1.20 euro per hour as max. Very quiet at night, the police didn't send me away and didn't issue a fine even though I passed. motorhome max length 7m"
80181,2686354,5,MiguelMachado,21/04/2023,"I stayed here for 2 days, it's quiet, it's right next to the baths, at this height both the baths and the park are free, I think they only start charging in June"
80181,2592888,5,Z_Ramone,27/02/2023,"a place where you can spend the night without a problem, free out of season for vans and not very large motorhomes, out of season you don't pay in the bathrooms either... the GC passed by and didn't say anything, it's the second time I've been in the place."
80181,2574550,4,laura2529,11/02/2023,"This is the car park for Fuente de los Banos. There is a path off the car park that takes you to the pool and is a 5 min walk. Our 7.4m camper was too big for the spaces so we were overhanging, it wasn’t busy so not a problem. Only stayed a few hours to swim and walk the dog. Car park is free out of season (dates on ticket machine) except Easter and bank holidays. Beautiful spot."
80181,2539419,1,Lacepavieja,03/01/2023,"They report if you park before 09:00. I parked at 7:30 to do a mountain route and not disturb the town and at 8:10 I already had the complaint... Although it seems stupid, it's better to park in the town, there are several areas where you can park or stay overnight without complaints . The policeman told me that the signal is put up by the town hall, he limits himself to complying with it, and the town hall completely passes."
80181,2534088,5,Kamubi,30/12/2022,"Quiet place to spend a couple of days and do some routes through the mountains. The hot spring is fine, but if there is no sun it is a bit difficult to enter at this time of year. Well-kept area. We have not paid for parking. There is no source or area to empty the poti. A pity. An Ac would give a lot of life to the town."
80181,2501438,4,Drownedrat,20/11/2022,"We only came for a few hours during the day but it's free to park at the moment, lots of space and  I think it would be fine to stay a night out of season if your van isn't too long (we are 6m). At the bottom of the steps - free toilets and  changing room for the beautiful pool ( I thought it was warm enough to swim in November!) plus outdoor cafe for a coffee afterwards."
80181,2408223,1,CamposCamper,27/09/2022,town that is not going to smell a single penny from my pocket nor is it going to receive my visit as long as it does not discriminate as it does to the motorhome world
80181,2405814,2,mugje023,26/09/2022,"parking is fine, you can walk to the nature reserve and that is really worth it!"
80181,1991246,1,Pakotinta,19/06/2022,"In this town they don't like ACs or campers, there are no sites enabled for it, they only care about earning money by bathing in a river, the river is very beautiful but a pity on the part of the town hall, dogs are not allowed to access the river , food limited to one sandwich and one liter of drink per person, etc. I wasn't worth it. No parking from 10:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m."
80181,1949781,4,TinaMaren,05/06/2022,"Free during the week, expensive at the weekend, 4.80 euros for 240 minutes and the bathroom costs extra. We had a quiet night during the week and were there with three other motorhomes. Walking distance to the natural hot springs. Asphalt, garbage can available."
80181,1932977,4,Furgoperea,30/05/2022,"We went on a Thursday to spend the day and we didn't have to pay for parking or to see the fountains, we thought that since it wasn't high season or a weekend, you didn't have to pay. Finally we went to another area to spend the night, since this car park is next to the road."
80181,1855961,4,FiatDucato94,27/04/2022,As a day parking lot to visit warm springs super! Paid €1.20 for 60 minutes. Sources are free during the week. We were there on Friday 4/22/22 around noon in cloudy weather and there was nothing going on. Water is 25 degrees warm. So not hot.
80181,1831339,3,fnlnf,17/04/2022,"we spend the night a lot of vans and 5 motorhomes, the local police pass by and if you are in lines (more or less) they don't say anything. 4 hours of parking €4.8 (from 9:00-20:00) and the ticket to go down to the pools €3.5 (€3 if you get it online) per adult. It seems to me that since the place is pretty, overcrowded for my taste... I guess that's why they charge for everything, because everything was crazy."
80181,1823095,3,mariajo1,15/04/2022,"We have slept peacefully together with 6 other motorhomes and vans. The police came by this morning and only ordered those who were online and had to be on battery to change. He hasn't said anything to the rest of us. During the day it is a blue zone, you have to pay at the machine"
80181,1762246,4,Djangolecce,21/02/2022,Large and rarely used car park in winter. Right now you don't pay. Perfect for a relaxing day in the thermal waters
80181,1750800,3,TheTurtleFamily,08/02/2022,Parking not great but for one or two hours of swimming it does.
80181,1517447,4,Faro12,26/08/2021,"It is next to the road, many people and little place to park, we were lucky, we spent the night, at first alone, then it was full of vans, the bad thing was the merriment that the young people had mounted until 6 in the morning, there , nobody said anything to them and the music sounded very loud, it is a shame the lack of respect of the people, not for us, if not at a general level"
80181,1468814,1,muscondi,17/08/2021,Blue zone paid parking .. € 1 20 every hour Uncomfortable for large motorhomes .. Pets are not allowed in the place .. The bathing area is very good .. I recommend parking somewhere else.
80181,1062492,1,superNessito,21/09/2020,"They have done it for 24 hours. Blue parking zone: for what you must pay yourself, or they can come and fine you."
80181,769332,1,siwa,16/01/2020,Expensive. We found lay-by on the road.
80181,726888,1,sonialex,21/10/2019,Parking during the day is not free. 1 hour = € 1.20
80181,429341,5,barou,14/02/2019,Free parking in this month of February. There was no one. I stayed there a good hour. The place is superb and the water is good. I am even bathed:
80181,411993,4,blackfury,05/12/2018,Well!
80181,383056,4,larryette,27/09/2018,Very good to go for a swim.
80181,294849,4,szipka,20/07/2018,We were here on Friday early afternoon and it was gratis. So we don't know when it is paying park unlike the photo of the table. We could find place to a 7 meters campervan but there isn't a lot of free place. It's near if you want to visit the beautiful Fuente de los Banos.
80218,2966766,1,FurgoCelta,15/07/2023,SITE CLOSED. They have put the stones back at the entrance.
80218,2917694,5,trovonix,03/07/2023,"perfect place to stay, nice view and accessible directly from the highway"
80218,2676920,1,Maquinawer,17/04/2023,The access is cut off by huge stones. no wonder it was the fishermen themselves who go to that place
80218,2142869,1,MobiSurf,29/07/2022,"The entrance is a big criminal, we don't want to damage our Womo, so we left"
80218,2106563,4,fabfontaine,22/07/2022,"Access ps simple for large motorhome but perfect place for a stopover, breathtaking view, perfect beach for swimming, but a little salty place near the motorhomes"
80218,2060758,3,robinboo75,11/07/2022,Good place to relax and eat quietly. the beach is very good but we had the bad luck that it was impossible to enter because of so much seaweed. It's a shame that people are so piggy with pee pees and handkerchiefs to clean Pepe.
80218,2022991,5,JeAlexOtto,29/06/2022,Fantastic parking overlooking the beautiful bridge ... We were all alone but slept super quiet and great.
80218,1527913,3,albanela,29/08/2021,"Quiet place between the road and the sea. Little parking, right now 8 cars and our van and it is practically complete. The best, the views, the worst the access. We don't spend the night, we just spend the day. There is a small cove."
80218,1293192,2,nuggifan,03/07/2021,Some strange person was standing right next to our camper late at night and smoking. Even though there was lot of space the person was standing right next to us. We felt uncomfortable and left. Nice view though.
80218,939574,1,monundenrique,08/08/2020,Not suitable for every motorhome due to the deep bump in the ground.
80218,922179,5,Maikyco,02/08/2020,"Perfect corner to spend the day, with a small cove next to it. There is little room to park, a few cars fit."
80218,762804,4,Jensesa,03/01/2020,"Unbeatable views. A little strawberry from the fishing boats and the road, but nothing too outrageous. Quiet night alone. If you go at night you have to go slowly to find the entrance that is dim. There is space."
80218,736894,4,Hugo_on_tour,02/11/2019,"Very calm and nice. In the night sometimes come cars and drive again and on the day parking and fishermen there, but it did not bother us."
80218,573861,2,Voyage_a_dos_de_Bidule,24/07/2019,"Very disappointing. Not so good, close to the highway, quite dirty with condoms everywhere. Little room, 3 maximum camper. The beach was completely covered with seaweed on our arrival, impossible to swim. We left."
80218,483697,5,heatherdale,14/05/2019,Stunning location. At 6m had to wait for locals to go to turn round to position ourselves for this mornings drive out. Very steep access we will crawl out in first gear. Unforgiving rocky parking surface. Slept safe and well. No services. One of those wonderful places that leaves amazing memory. Locals swimming and fishing. Very limited space to walk the dogs.
80218,422763,4,simZone,16/01/2019,Very nice view. Very small place. Pretty. Offside...
80218,365865,3,aldipa,05/09/2018,"A very nice cove, with spectacular views. Site for few cars or van. Several fishermen. We do not stay to sleep, too far apart. Without services"
80219,781123,4,Bsavoye,16/02/2020,"Good place to fall back, when the other sites are colonized by young people with sound systems worse than a nightclub."
80219,467309,4,jerryweidemagmail.com,25/04/2019,"Very good and quiet spot, spent the night without problems. No services, but there's a nice bar with a friendly host! Impossible for our camper to take the dirt roads to the other Park4Nights close by. Very good alternative!"
80226,2757436,3,KerryAnn,17/05/2023,"This clearly is parking for the bar, but a lovely little stop of for refreshment and a short walk both to the newer swimming area and town."
80226,1561226,2,gaturcas,09/09/2021,"Nice spot, but a lot of traffic in the street (even at night). Difficult to sleep well ..."
80226,1031419,4,F.Miranda,07/09/2020,"New area, very good for any size 5.5m on one side of the river, other sidebar the river no problem to big vans. Very good swimming area. Rebuilt in 2019, good pic-nic area to. Padel and kayak is possible! Good to stay at night very safe, only one bar and wc."
80226,264916,4,joaooquim,07/06/2018,"Very beautiful place next to a river, with a bar with an esplanade with a prestigious view to the bed of the Ribeira (esplanade suspended over the bed). Free wi-fi available from the bar. site still under construction, I think it is to make a campsite with various resources on the other side of the bank. Bridge under construction. water to drink or fill the available water tank on the side of the road."
80228,264741,3,ventures,06/06/2018,"We made a stop this day after hours of driving without roadside rest stops. This station is abandoned, but located on both sides of the road. No worries of security we were alone. Having lost the photo by sending my email, I made a photo by internet."
80229,315167,3,Calitonet,04/08/2018,"Fair places in August to stop, 2 meters from the road a lot of noise but to spend a good night"
80330,704602,1,ElisabethJean,26/09/2019,This car park is prohibited for motorhomes at night. We just had a GNR test in the middle of the night. The guards allowed us to finish the night in the parking lot but we will have to leave the premises early tomorrow morning. Notice to amateurs!
80333,2724889,1,kriscris,05/05/2023,"street closed, it cannot be reached and as far as it can be accessed is the blue zone"
80333,2552422,1,CFam,15/01/2023,Still not accessible due to street works.
80333,2467076,1,euge,28/10/2022,"As of 28/10/22 become inaccessible, and under construction"
80333,2423296,4,AgurAlber,04/10/2022,"good place between a campsite and another, and beach in 10 meters because now out of season parking is free and there is hardly anyone"
80333,2378095,4,lubiczklan,16/09/2022,"We spent good, quiet night over there. 4 stars because of lack of the toilet or something what would be similar to it."
80333,2312103,1,boxerh2l3mat,28/08/2022,"You don't rest well on Saturday, August 27. Very difficult to sleep for various reasons; Surrounding campsites with disco music until 1:00 am, cars have come to this area to park and party until 2:00 am, and lots of people coming and going from the beach with a few too many beers, shouting, touching the van, etc. so with interruptions until 4am. And at 8:30 I hear people and cars going back to the beach."
80333,2239296,5,AraceliMartin,14/08/2022,"a perfect night. We arrived at 11:00 p.m. and spent the night. the beach two steps away. It is a blue zone, €6 per day maximum. very quiet and safe place. The police passed by just as we arrived. They were very kind and explained other places to camp in the area of the Costa Brava that was our destination."
80333,2182400,4,pondersvan,06/08/2022,"We have spent a good night, 20 meters from the sand. Quite calm. Recommendable. We arrived at 19:00 and we were alone, we got up with three more vans. Ideal for visiting the Tordera delta."
80333,2122090,4,betbe,25/07/2022,"Good area to park and in front of the beach, less crowded than S'Abanell. You almost always find a place. The only flaw we could say is that it is a blue zone and that there is the typical movement of people leaving and entering the campsites."
80333,1953984,5,Lucky-Lizard,06/06/2022,A dream of parking (free until June 15th and from September 15th) - right on the beach. I have no idea why everyone else is switching to the numerous campsites around.
80333,1252557,3,alionilla,13/06/2021,"Parking next to the street, near the beach of Blanes and next to a campsite. Comfortable so as not to get complicated and not in a secluded place, although quite noisy from cars coming and going, even on weekdays."
80333,1246506,5,NinaMahal,10/06/2021,"Have been here several times now with the motorhome. I recommend coming early, before 9am, turning around at the very front, and then standing with the door facing the sidewalk. This is the most comfortable way to avoid being parked. Free of charge until 14.6. then 6 € day. I go to the promende at 10pm and sleep there. For me, this place is perfect to go to the beach with the dogs."
80333,1171345,4,FredWoMo,10/04/2021,Initially a quiet place. Obviously a hotspot for surfers when the waves are high. Whole street full of cars on both sides. Police drove past but tolerated us. Bad internet for those who need it.
80333,756739,4,msprm620,25/12/2019,Out of season eco .. Right on the beach ...
80333,746902,1,stevewoods,25/11/2019,The location is good but we ended up leaving at 1.30 am. cars come near you in the night often the same cars so it seems a place to drug deal or they consider a break in.  felt very uncomfortable for the first time on out trip.  It's a shame as it could be a nice place to stay
80333,664263,1,sodeuxde,28/08/2019,Traditional paying parking 6 € per day. no camper location.
80333,637875,4,Dorifg,17/08/2019,"It's all right, all you have to pay twice as much, but it's worth it, because you're near the beach"
80333,433120,4,mexipo,24/02/2019,"Place with spectacular views of the beginning of the Costa Brava near the mouth of the river Tordera, without problems in low season, somewhat isolated at 50 m beach."
80333,416104,4,Pess,26/12/2018,"Free parking when it's not season, perfect for one night. At 20mt from the beach, wonderful view at sunset and sunrise. In winter a little isolated and dark."
80368,2041687,1,VictorCerro,05/07/2022,"It no longer works, they have put a padlock on it so that it cannot be entered."
80368,571974,4,ArturoVitoria,23/07/2019,"Very good site Snack with shade and ample parking. To put a catch, when we went, the toilets and showers were closed. Otherwise, a recommended site."
80411,3221088,4,atalia27,26/08/2023,"An insanely beautiful place!!! Incomprehensible! Ominous silence and evening, a bit busy during the day. The big minus is the distance of the car from the water, we parked our trailer in the neat parking lot, which is a cute and natural lawn surrounded by vegetation and a country house and a 2-minute walk from the natural pool and the waterfall. Recommend anyway!!"
80411,2982042,4,interarte,18/07/2023,Bathroom from the bar open all day and night. Ok to spend the night. During the day it’s a bit noisy and crowded.
80411,2754698,4,KerryAnn,16/05/2023,"only gave it four stars because the parking is next to someone's house and you feel like you could be in their garden, but otherwise it's a lovely spot.

There is no view of the rock when we are in the van, you have to walk 100m to be able to access the view. Too bad there is a lot of waste such as toilet paper etc on the floor which spoils the thing."

Was tight for us at 7m. Drive up is gravelly and rocky, doesn’t need 4x4 but not good for large, low-clearance campers. Road is a bit overgrown so anything wider than 2.1m may have trouble. Two other campers turned up after us, so best to arrive early."

80584,608050,5,Supertramp80,07/08/2019,"Wonderful place! Great view. Some hikers come by, otherwise super quiet! have been there since 16h and the place was free. Also without 4x4 came up. Highly Recommended!"
80584,564804,5,tnjstrck,20/07/2019,"Beautiful and calm place with an incredible view! 4x4 is not necessary, we got there with a Van. During summer it is recommendable to go there early, we had to try three days at a row to get the place because there wAs already someone.."
80584,477838,4,dsk81,06/05/2019,"It's good, beautiful view is quiet but must pick up the toilet paper that you let nature is not a trash that's why everything will be closed one day and we will pay for campsites."
80584,450134,5,ilikegerkins,07/04/2019,Very peaceful and amazing views on a clear day. I managed to get up here in a 2wd Mwb Renault Master although I had to take the gravel section in first gear. Definitely achievable in a van and well worth it.
80584,396129,4,Flori_in_Aix,20/10/2018,"Super nice place, even in the autumn mist. unfortunately we could not see much, but we enjoyed the peace very much. In the morning there are some joggers and hikers on the way."
80584,323378,5,TheCasualOnes,09/08/2018,"Only accessible for 4x4. But 500m down the street from the marked parking area, there is another area where one can stay, even without 4x4. Hill is steep, but no problem. Amazing view!"
80584,315403,5,Mathis84,05/08/2018,"Best place ever! Pure nature, absolute peace and an incredible view of the sea and the city with beach! But 4x4 recommended !! The road is very unpaved."
80591,1785491,4,hymer540kobe,17/03/2022,"Small vans can park. A bigger motorhome can instead park in the old N2 road by the entrance to the village, close to an old building (road restaurant) that is derelict. N2 does not have much traffic as it was bypsssed by A2. Aluenda has a yoga retreat and offers a wonderful hike to ""Pico del Rayo"" peak if you have good legs."
80591,724705,2,meatwaggon,18/10/2019,"Beautiful and quiet, but the pesky flies drove me away in the end, so didn't stay the night!"
80591,470860,4,Tatina,29/04/2019,"Quiet place to stop on the route, nice views and lots of silence at night!"
80615,3250751,4,cn240fm,02/09/2023,"quiet and secure area. the showers are a little old but someone cleans them every day, so very clean. there is even toilet paper in the toilets, even better than at the campsite! if necessary washing machine and dryer (fee). The only downside is that the staff gives us explanations in English and not in Spanish."
80615,3229178,3,Watou,28/08/2023,"It's pretty good to go to Barcelona, a bit expensive but correct, on the other hand if you have to call the emergency number do not use whatapp as indicated on the reception panel, it does not answer, make a call classic!"
80615,3226571,1,LizzySalzman,27/08/2023,"outrageous! The toilets stink and there is no soap, you have to shower with cold water and 5 minutes for 1 euro, you can only use the WiFi in the room itself, and paying 25 euros per night is very cheeky!"
80615,3213661,4,gillesBosq,25/08/2023,"very convenient for visiting Barcelona and going to the beach at night. 10 minutes walk from the train and the beach which takes 30 minutes to the city center. do not hesitate to come in and stand in the middle to take a place as soon as it frees up (it turns a lot we did not wait long) correct shower, nothing more. 25 euro it is certainly expensive but for the proximity of Barcelona"
80615,3178892,2,marduck72,19/08/2023,"the train stop is 1 km away, price a bit high given that you have to pay for the showers and little supervision, the sneaky (to say the least) who stood next to us invaded our pitch and the one on the other side . As there was no night surveillance present it made noise until 2am. I recommend other place to visit Barcelona."
80615,3156609,3,lolos77500,16/08/2023,Ok well for the night provided you have a steely mind I waited 4 hours to get a place be careful it's not the first to arrive who takes the place c the Law of stronger AND as soon as you take the ticket and you go home no matter what you pay 25€ even if you want to come out after 1 hour or 30 minutes SHOWER AND WC too old
80615,3124261,5,chiaragyk,11/08/2023,"Not beautiful, but at least safe and clean!"
80615,3113637,5,MarioFamilyVan,10/08/2023,"Convenient stop to visit Barcelona with a train that takes you directly to the city center in about 40 minutes. If you arrive in the evening and it is full, you can stop outside for the night and wait for the morning exits, the road is safe and the police often pass by to check. the right services without pretensions, I would say the only valid solution for Barcelona."
80615,3101997,4,GlennDumo,08/08/2023,"One of the better places as a base for Barcelona as it is so close and relatively cheap. Don't expect great luxury either. It is certainly not a campsite to spend hours on (although I did do that to watch a football match, pretty good WiFi ;)"
80615,3077331,4,Orca_ma,04/08/2023,When we arrived there was no room and they put us on a waiting list for the next day in the middle of the street so we couldn't hook up the light. It has no shadow. The rest of the services ok. The showers are paid €1/5min. Payment is in cash €25/24h
80615,3047364,5,theworld,30/07/2023,Very good. Recommend Everything is automatic. Quiet. Good for visiting Barcelona. Train is 5 minutes walk away. Beach tb 5 minutes.
80615,3046344,5,Maverick1960,30/07/2023,We spent a quiet night here. Convenient to visit Barcelona.
80615,2984659,5,Chidionvan,18/07/2023,"Rest area very clean, loading and unloading ok. Under the sun and payment in cash €25/1 day. Current CONNECTION with schuko socket!! 15 minutes from the sea and the station"
80615,2983495,4,chispeantes,18/07/2023,"The emptying of black water is comfortable, with a hose to rinse well. There is not a shadow and the spaces are not very big, but it is reasonable to be able to visit Barcelona. We would return. It is slightly on the slope but with a chock it can be fixed well. At night it is quiet. It takes about an hour to get to Barcelona (on a crowded train)."
80615,2978707,1,cedricg03,17/07/2023,"Horrible. Arrived at 7 p.m., full of people, even caravans. The management piles up in Indian thread in the middle of the aisle, bumper against bumper, 25 euros for her, a joke, inadmissible in the event of a problem I think. We finished higher and much quieter than this dealership parking lot"
80615,2942641,4,PasqualeS,09/07/2023,"Fully automated parking area, clean and well maintained. Good for visiting Barcelona: a 10-minute walk takes you to Vilassar de Mar station and an hour by train (line R1) takes you to Plaza de Catalunya. In July 2023 we paid 26 euros per night with electricity. There is no shade."
80615,2942489,4,lkanning,09/07/2023,"Very nice parking space, easy to reach, about 10 minutes walk to the beach. Showers great, costs 1 €/5 min."
80615,2941145,5,MSchollbach,09/07/2023,Super nice camper place and ideal starting point to visit Barcelona and to go swimming on the Costa Brava. All services available.
80615,2921217,4,jake80,04/07/2023,Convenient place to reach Barcelona by train. Beach 5 minutes walk. Clean bathrooms. The only negative note for us was the connection of the socket because it is not the standard one but Schuko. We did 3 days on battery.
80615,2919993,4,Ducutza,03/07/2023,"I gave 4 star due to the fact that even though they are saying that you can leave before 12 PM, we were charged with 6€ for 4 hours, we arrived on check in at 7AM on Friday and left today (Monday) before 12 PM. The drier is not drying the clothes, I had to dry them twice. Other than that I can recommend this place, it's safe and not far from the train station."
80615,2918914,5,Pinuccio2023,03/07/2023,Nice motorhome area with all the necessary services in the surroundings. Toilet and shower area always very clean. A 10-minute walk away is the train station which takes you to Barcelona in 30 minutes (last train around 11.45pm). €18 in low season and €25 in high season for a 24-hour stop (when you enter you take a ticket and the bar opens so the count is precise). Then €1 per hour up to another 7h
80615,2916151,5,mymy34,02/07/2023,Nice secure and quiet motorhome area. 10 minutes walk from the sea and the train station. 20-25 minutes from Barcelona. Close to supermarkets and a gas station. Clean showers and toilets (1€ for 5 minutes for hot water). 25€ per day in summer. Small flat there are no trees or separation between the pitches.
80615,2907909,4,Sara_90s,30/06/2023,"Convenient parking area to reach central Barcelona in about 45 minutes. €20 all inclusive, July and August €25: electricity, wifi, water loading and unloading. payment in cash upon exit. hot showers €1 for 5 minutes, washing machine €7 and dryer €4. vending machines and coffee maker available beach 10 minute walk away. only flaw there is no shadow"
80615,2906099,5,halli_hallo,29/06/2023,"Great straight course with fine gravel. Take your card when you drive in, pay *in cash* at the machine before you exit. Toilets very clean, hot shower for 1€ (keep a single coin ready), coffee and snacks from the machine. Very quiet, 10 minutes walk from the beach or from the train station to Barcelona. Fresh water, waste water, rubbish, WiFi and electricity are included in the 25€ per night. TOP"
80615,2896910,5,thecat62,27/06/2023,"Good and clean place ideal to visit Barcelona. Just 10 minutes walk from Cabrera de Mar station (ticket for 3 zones, train R1). Showers are very good, toilets are clean. Staff is friendly and helpful!"
80615,2889524,4,lu26,25/06/2023,"Area well located, very comfortable, lack of staff to give some information about the area, thank you as well."
80615,2877040,5,papaschlumpf42,21/06/2023,"good place, because we used to stand by the sea, but it's no longer allowed there, and it's actually difficult to get out again after it rained. So really great, everything very clean and safe to go to Barcelona by train."
80615,2840785,4,djipi5,10/06/2023,"We spent 3 nights there, 60€, a motorhome, a trailer, 2 people. Same price without trailer and to more people. Closed in the evening at 10 or 11 p.m., gate to enter. Quiet, slept well, no shade. Hot shower at 1€ for 5 minutes. Some problems with evacuation in the toilets. Own."
80615,2839537,5,jangabriel,10/06/2023,"Very nice place , close to the sea (10 minutes walk) , train is about 15 minutes walk to Barcelona . All is very clean , arranged and very quiet . Price is ok for all the services provided . Recommend it"
80615,2828333,4,yang082288,07/06/2023,"I didn’t see it recently so I’m making note of the 1€ fee for hot water shower. The cold shower is great too, since summer is here. The entire lot is sloping a little. Cash only payment. Snack machine is funny because all the labels are backwards so you can’t tell what any of the drinks are."
80615,2820998,5,charlig,04/06/2023,"Very good site. Showers, toilets, quiet area. For €20 you have parking and electricity."
80615,2784380,4,mahonc,25/05/2023,"A good basic site for a few days while visiting Barcelona. Stayed 2 quiet nights.  Pitches average size. 
 Toilets not too clean while we were there but that is the fault of the users and some dirty fool emptied his sewer into the gray water drain."
80615,2777316,1,Gellis,22/05/2023,"Rinsing is only possible with cold water. During our stay, all the toilets were unfortunately so dirty that it was unthinkable to use them. The pitches are quite tight and the train to Barcelona takes more like 30 minutes at a brisk pace. Travel time around 40 minutes. All in all rather an expensive ""parking lot"""
80615,2776289,2,pacasu,22/05/2023,"Wide, level spaces and easy to park. well located to go to the beach, a 10-minute walk away, or to visit Barcelona, a 10-minute walk away, you can catch a train that leaves you in the center in approximately 1 hour. Both the unloading area and the bathrooms and showers are quite clean. The only drawback that I put to the area is not to charge by card and not to inform you, until you are going to pay."
80615,2776053,5,melonncito,22/05/2023,"Amazing!! We came for a service (water refill and emptying) and found extremely helpful and resourceful reception staff. The area was super clean and honestly it was one of the best services areas I’ve been to. Thank you so much, we will be back!"
80615,2761402,5,JustinLakey,18/05/2023,"A brilliant site if you want to spend some time in the city. Toilets and Shower very clean and well looked after, €1 per 5 minutes for a shower was incredibly reasonable and very hot. We felt comfortable leaving our van here for a whole day alone whilst we explored the city and never felt worried. €20 a night outside of the summer season is a steal. You won't regret parking here!"
80615,2760984,4,thesleepysprinter,18/05/2023,Great if you’re travelling into Barcelona and want to know your van will be safe/secure. Toilets fairly clean. We filled up with fresh water and emptied our grey tank free of charge. 20€ for 24hours. Walk 15mins and catch the R1 straight into the city!
80615,2752875,3,lenny1996,15/05/2023,"If you are visiting Barcelona and want to be sure of your car, the place is ok. toilets clean. 20€ the night. We arrived at 9 and left at 11 the next day and had to pay 23€. It will be billed again per hour if you exceed the 24 hours. All other services also cost extra."
80615,2751936,5,PeterMcGoran,15/05/2023,a really lovely spot. we were here in June for Primavera Festival and it was busy but we still managed to get a space. lovely location away from Barcelona but with the possibility of going in.
80615,2744096,5,franber77,12/05/2023,"Ideal motorhome air for visiting Barcelona, train 10 minutes walk from the center of Barcelona, safety and tranquility, I highly recommend this place"
80615,2722269,3,Albiasalbias,04/05/2023,only for the night near station and beach bof not worth the 20 euros
80615,2715550,4,indigovan,02/05/2023,"Suitable place for visiting Barcelona as it is well connected by metro. Everything is kept simple on the pitch, the toilets and showers could be a little more hygienic. Overall, for the price, it's absolutely fine."
80615,2697990,4,ecostt,26/04/2023,"Simple pitch, narrow, but everything you need is there, and rather quiet. Ideal as a secure parking space for visiting Barcelona"
80615,2691455,2,OssauMillenium,23/04/2023,"Suitable area, but crowded: motorhomes park in the central aisle: great maneuvers for departure. Pitch €10 (washing machine €7 dryer €4 not really cheap). The sanitary facilities leave something to be desired."
80615,2686795,2,doohnibor,21/04/2023,"The square gets crammed with cars, so many have to stand in the middle where there aren't actually any parking spaces. If someone wants to drive early, you have to move your car too. €18 is too expensive for that."
80615,2686683,4,yeah37,21/04/2023,"Not a dream place at all but it does the job very well, the main thing is a safe area, rather quiet and above all well placed to go to Barcelona, train 10min walk away"
80615,2683726,4,cofoha,20/04/2023,"Secure area. Ideal for visiting Barcelona in peace. The train station is about 1/4 hour on foot. €18/24h, this price is reasonable for the services offered. On your arrival, if ""full"" is displayed, do not hesitate to contact the reception because they still accept the parking of a few cc in the middle of the central aisle."
80615,2679920,5,fredpaoli,18/04/2023,"very pleasant area, I would rather say 1h20 to get to the center of Barcelona (25km), very quiet night but full area from the middle of the afternoon, reservation impossible"
80615,2671809,4,barbatruc33,15/04/2023,a motorhome area that allows you to park your van safely to visit Barcelona serenely. adequate services with toilets and showers. a good solution during the week and out of season!
80615,2665935,5,charrier38,12/04/2023,"Clean, quiet, hot shower 5 minutes for 1€, perfect for visiting Barcelona"

80615,2648876,4,josemaria27,08/04/2023,"Due to so many ac thefts in Barcelona, this camp is safe and clean, it is close to the beach and the train station to visit Barcelona,"
80615,2645766,5,Filspellward,07/04/2023,"the description above is correct is 100% correct.
we stayed 3 night to visit Barcelona and it was ideal for that."
80615,2630097,4,RobertoAiram,29/03/2023,"We paid €18 per night and you have all the services except the hot water in the shower that you have to pay for, the Lidl that is supposedly nearby is already closed and doesn't work and it takes 10 minutes to get to the train station that goes to Barcelona for 7.70 € the round trip. For the rest a camping only to sleep has no more."
80615,2615302,4,Stan91,19/03/2023,"Quite expensive (18€/24h) but well maintained, safe and electricity included. First check whether there is still a place available, otherwise you pay 4€ for free. Showers €1. Restaurant CasAnita 15 minutes from the square highly recommended. With the train for €7.70 round trip to Barcelona because parking there is too expensive. Book Park Güell in Barcelona in advance otherwise sold out."
80615,2614584,4,FamilieSchlenkerbein,18/03/2023,"Perfect place to visit Barcelona. Vending machine at the entrance. Beach & train not far away. If the ticket machine doesn't work, you can pay when you get off in Barcelona. Playgrounds nearby. Showers & toilets clean & cleaned daily. Showers €1 for 5 minutes. Coin-changing machine available. Small lounge. We stayed 2 nights and had nothing to complain about."

80615,2596786,1,Ratenfaenger,03/03/2023,We tried to book online no response it doesn't work. Why ? It's an automatic machine at the entrance so first come first served. it's a sardine parking lot to avoid I don't understand people who like it you can barely open the door of your cc. we went elsewhere.
80615,2596134,5,ThaMonkeyKilla,02/03/2023,"Pitch serves its purpose. Showers/toilets clean. A short walk to the beach and the train to Barcelona. Is located at the end of a residential area and supposedly a safe parking space. A coin changing machine is available. The best thing to do is to check on foot beforehand whether there is a space, because you have to pay €4 with the entrance. At most the WiFi would be to complain about."
80615,2589646,4,SL120881,24/02/2023,Parking space is appropriate. Showers are great. Wifi can hardly be used from the mobile home due to poor reception. But is a good place to visit Barcelona.

Basically a parking lot amongst a housing estate. 15 minute walk to beach & small shop about 2 mins"
80615,2564067,4,chartingfamily,30/01/2023,"Only solution to stay close to Barcelona with the motorhome. Clean secure but always full. We arrived one morning and had room but those who arrive at the end of the day often don't have room. the toilets are clean and the showers too, however, the water is warm and really hot for the last 30 seconds. So in winter it's not great."
80615,2561688,4,MarionRenner,27/01/2023,Good and clean place to explore the area. 18 euros per night including electricity is fine.
80615,2561232,1,RolandSchwabe,26/01/2023,"We drove to the square, noticed that it was already overcrowded and wanted to leave the square after about 2 minutes. Ticket held up, unfortunately the barrier remained closed. I pressed the emergency button, the bell rang and nothing happened. So to the machine, it wanted €4 and we were able to drive out. Please check if there is still space."
80615,2559382,5,Hafenperle72,24/01/2023,"Info: Both machines at the train station are defective. If you want to go to Barcelona (line R1), just get on. Drive to Plaza Catalunya (directly on the Rambla) and tell the information desk there. They know the problem. You can then redeem the 7.85€ otherwise you won't be able to get out of the station. Buy a Zone 3 ticket on the way back."
80615,2558590,5,xaedalada,23/01/2023,"Best place to stay when visiting Barcelona - vans are very safe here meaning you can go out all day and evening without worry.

€18 per night is okay with electric included, if you're doing washing don't waste money on the dryer as it doesn't dry but instead just hang it in the sun.

Best time to arrive is 9-11am when people leave. If you arrive & it's full just park down the middle til morning."
80615,2552345,3,Annelinee,15/01/2023,One of the closest place to Barcelona if you need electricity. Showers didn’t get warm properly (first time only after 4 minutes and the second time it got cold during the last minute); some machines (dryer and coffee machine) are not working although a note is missing so you end up spending money without getting service. Rather full.
80615,2552047,5,Fredizbo,15/01/2023,Everything is perfect. The only downside is that the area is not indicated by signs and that you cannot reserve in advance. Please note: provide cash for payment.
80615,2550795,4,Jan1950,13/01/2023,"Beautiful camper place with distant views of the mountains and not the sea. Clean sanitary facilities and all amenities. Train to Barcelona (R1) runs 4 times an hour from Cabrera de Mar station. Cycling to Barcelona is a disaster for the first 5 km through a wasteland, but the next 20 km is better. It is not recommended to cycle in the dark."
80615,2543601,5,XiscaP,06/01/2023,"Great area to visit Barcelona and leave your car in a safe place. Electricity is included in the price. You pay €1 for the shower and it lasts 5 minutes, which seems correct to me. The showers are clean and the water is hot. To sleep it is not noisy at this time (January)."

80615,2543133,2,DalMez,05/01/2023,This place must be popular because it is full. They are supposed to be open 4-6 but they were closed. Also closed 06/01. There was a lineup in the street of RVs. If you are winging it I’d head for somewhere more reliable.
80615,2542296,5,davidon,05/01/2023,"We stopped by here to take a shower and to empty our toilet. The whole thing worked wonderfully even though all the seats were occupied. We were able to take a shower (warm water €1 for 5 minutes) - emptying the waste water actually costs €4, but the operators still let us empty our toilet for free."

80615,2540701,5,Landcruiser75,04/01/2023,"Place sure very nice, but something of overcrowded. The residents and the police still have nothing against the van being parked along the access road when there is no more space."
80615,2532171,4,Vanessa071988,29/12/2022,"Very well located & secure (under video surveillance) parking space to visit Barcelona. Shower 1€, not very warm. Cleanliness could be better. 10 mins to train station & approx. 30 mins to Barcelona. The square was always full, even the middle of the square is used. WoMos were already standing in front of the barrier in the morning. The whole residential area is full of WoMos. Supply & disposal available. Currently €18."
80615,2529981,4,kostina845,27/12/2022,"We came here only because of the good safety reviews. There are CCTV cameras and a lot of motorhomes. 4 stars for the fact that it is very crowded, there are a lot of caravans, there is no personal place next to the car. It took a total of 40 minutes to get to the city. Wi-fi catches well only at the reception. Cleaned every morning, clean and welcome to be. Thanks."
80615,2529819,4,ksm-jonas,27/12/2022,"There is (almost) nothing to complain about here, for half the price of the surrounding CP, the camper is safe here and you can easily reach Barcelona by train. The WiFi is also very good near the reception and the bathrooms are cleaned daily. But there is 1 star deduction for - The expensive washing machine (7 €) - Paying exclusively in cash Be sure to come early, space fills up quickly! :)"
80615,2527510,5,JeroenHoek,24/12/2022,Great place for a visit to Barcelona. Sanitary facilities and the environment are clean. Village is fine.
80615,2527469,5,Alepedro,24/12/2022,Found it complete but it gave me an excellent impression and then if it's complete..... there will be a reason. Stopped for the night in the nearby paid parking lots which are free in this period.
80615,2524916,3,PowByte,20/12/2022,"Spent 3 nights, we took the train to Barcelona for 2 days from the station near by Cabrera del Mar.. Google maps suggest the next one which is in 2 km. I gave 3 stars because the entrance to service area entrance was very bumpy and I motorhome struggled to get it. They should invest some money to level it."

80615,2513493,4,patou241,05/12/2022,Good spot to visit Barcelona with electricity and services: 10 min walk and 35 min train journey to get to Plaça Catalunya. We stayed there for 3 days. The laundry is to be avoided: washing (7€) ok but drying at 4€ it took 3 to get dry laundry... and the charming lady at the reception only reimbursed us for one...

But the exit is very narrow, the side streets feel like every 300m a 20-30cm high calming hump, many touch down, whoever has a large overhang is dangerous. The grinding marks can be seen. Wlan does not arrive. 7€ for a load of laundry is too expensive."
80615,2503109,3,BebopontheRoad,22/11/2022,"Seemed to be a fine place, but I have to give it 3 star as I couldnt enter. It was full, but it still supposed to let you in for 90 minutes to use services for 4 euros. Whats more, it had a sign that clearly wasnt out out by the staff, to indicate that it is full. So I had to do an entire detective act myself. The toilet wasn't too clean and had no hot water nor soap."
80615,2494300,4,MichaelFischer,13/11/2022,"Unfortunately, only cash payment possible Places large enough for 2 days, 2 showers and 2 toilets for all campers. 18 euros is including water and electricity Shower 1 euro for 5 minutes is just a lot of traffic through the campers.

80615,2481505,4,jessetsteftravel,04/11/2022,"Area with all the necessary services. What we appreciated was the little chalet where you can find tables and chairs, board games, books, a coffee and food vending machine. The area is located in a nice residential area, payment is only in cash via a terminal. On the other hand, the price is quite high (18€ for 24 hours)."

80615,2473994,4,MickaeletGeraldine,31/10/2022,very practical area to visit Barcelona but I do not see any other interest because in the middle of a dormitory city without interest. a little petty to charge for hot showers .. on the other hand it is better to arrive not too late because at 5 p.m. everything is already full.
80615,2470203,4,Wohlmobil22,29/10/2022,"Nice place, but it could get very hot in summer because there are no shaded areas. Unfortunately the prices have been increased, from 15 euros to 18 euros and the washing machine from 4 euros to 7 euros. The good thing is that the parking lot is monitored. If you want to go downtown or to the beach, you don't have to worry. (all at your own risk though)"
80615,2467229,3,fan4womo,28/10/2022,"Exactly 25 km from the Sagrada Familia. Barcelona can be reached via the cycle path along the beach promenade (not always well signposted). You should have battery and time for about 60-70 km to visit Barcelona. The parking space is too expensive for what it offers. But it is the cheapest alternative to the campsites, all of which are extremely expensive, even in the off-season."

But for 25 euros a night we expected more: no soap or toilet brush in the toilets, 1 euro for a 5-minute shower, no shade. Ideal as an emergency solution, but not advisable if you have other alternatives."

There's still room for improvement."

Luckily in my case I only had to empty black water and even so they charge €4 for pouring water into a toilet"

They say non-potable water so you can get water from the vending machine (that water is sanitary as in the entire urbanization), hot water in the shower with coins that do not work, dirty, without surveillance... They do not reserve even paying beforehand. If you arrive and there is no place, it will hold you. Very bad."

80615,2070657,4,emilycardus,14/07/2022,Having read reviews about Barcelona break ins we opted to pay for the safety. The site is convenient and has good facilities. Showers and toilets are clean. But most importantly we felt safe leaving the van whilst going to the city. It’s about a 15 minute walk to the train station which is then 35/40 minutes into the centre.
80615,2060613,5,fabiocat,11/07/2022,Comfortable area with functioning and clean services. 500 m from the beach and the Ldl supermarket. Friendly and helpful staff. Comfortable and frequent train to reach Barcelona in 40 minutes.

The price is somewhat expensive (€25/day) but in Catalonia it seems that everything is savage at the parking level... a super quiet place to spend the night, no noise, cold showers and hot showers for €1 for 5 minutes. Electricity and free Wi-Fi with a very good signal."
80615,2047550,3,MehliMobil,07/07/2022,"In itself a nice place. In the high season €25 for 24 hours. The sanitary building is small but sufficient. However, the sanitary facilities are in urgent need of renovation. On a positive note, there is also a disabled toilet with shower. But here, too, a renovation is urgently needed. Hot water in the shower costs €1 for 5 minutes. Sinks are outside - unfortunately only with cold water. 7€ for a washing machine load seems a bit overpriced to me. The dryer, on the other hand, only costs €4. The beach, train station and a Lidl can be reached in just 10 minutes on foot. Barcelona can be reached by train in about 40 minutes."

By bike from the station, it is 5 minutes away, while from the station to Barcelona it is about 40 minutes by public transport. Transporting the bike is not quite as simple as they say. In the metro there are no convenient accesses, you have to take the lift (one bike at a time) and often there is no bike."
80615,2006903,4,patriceFURLAN,24/06/2022,Location very well located allowing to visit Barcelona and to go to the beach. Perfect with children to vary the activities. The places are not very big (we can't fully pull out the blind). All the amenities for the motorhome very easy to access. Free access toilets. Washing machine and paying showers.
80615,2005218,4,samuelixx,24/06/2022,I recommend this area only for visiting Barcelona. Hot water only in the shower and for a fee (1 € / 5min). To wash the dishes 2 sinks always dirty and with cold water (I do not recommend washing the dishes directly). For the cost of 2 days (36 €) the services are few. Having said that we were in a secure parking lot. Nice beach in front. Wifi included. Train station 10min walk.
80615,1999102,4,Englandscamper,21/06/2022,"Great location for visiting Barcelona - short walk to station and very regular trains to/from the centre. Also walking distance to beach. Facilities were fairly basic and not the cleanest. Campsite works as a self serve, requires cash to pay on departure."

The beach is not far, the train connection to Barcelona is great and the parking space is cheap (18€/24h). A good option for anyone who is traveling spontaneously if not arriving late. absolutely to suggest"

No toilet paper, no soap, it probably hasn't been cleaned in a few days because it looks and smells really disgusting (public toilets are better maintained). In the evening the hot water in the shower did not work. It is such a pity that the owners do not take better care of this place."
80615,1938276,5,fiskdamm,02/06/2022,Great camping for the location. Flat parking spots with electricity. Clean facilities and reasonable price. Not really camping feeling but who are in Barcelona to hang out at the camping? Feels more like a parking ground for motor homes and vans than a camping. Safe with fence around. Easy access to Barcelona with train.
80615,1936396,5,Marmotte1956,01/06/2022,This seems to be the best option for visiting Barcelona. Very quiet location in a residential suburb with the commuter train 800m away (good frequency).

80615,1930834,4,Marcel97150,30/05/2022,"We had some reservations before landing here, but it turns out that it's the perfect place to leave your vehicle and set off to explore Barcelona. (leaving early, returning late) The sanitary facilities were clean and the nights quiet. At the time of departure, we could not pay by credit card, only in cash. Banks at 1.2 km. Thanks to the neighbors and their bikes."
80615,1911012,4,CattinJ,23/05/2022,"Not picturesque & staff  involvement is minimal making this a virtually automated experience - but it's a secure base in a safe seeming neighborhood and easy to travel by train into Barcelona (30 mins). €18 no EHU, €1 for 5 mins hot water was all ok but €7 for the washing machine when it clearly used to be 4 seems greedy. Not the best value compared to other cities but then Barcelona is expensive"
80615,1909916,5,Rikou91,23/05/2022,"Very well placed, clean sanitary facilities, many services. I recommend."
80615,1900514,3,giachard,19/05/2022,"unfortunately, once you have entered, if you want to go out for an excursion and then return you have to pay the ticket for another 24 hours and in any case always if there is still space as it is not reserved. the WiFi doesn't seem to work if you are not near the reception"
80615,1895439,4,cecea,17/05/2022,"Convenient area for visiting Barcelona, 10 minutes from the train station and Lidl. the services are essential and cost above average. There is no shade, if you stay in the camper for lunch in the summer you gasp."
80615,1887340,4,OlivierHilde,13/05/2022,"Great place with various services. 1st night slept peacefully, 2nd night less as a coach wanted to leave at 2 am that could not make the turn to the exit. Use of the washing machine is €7. Showering is €1 for 5 minutes of hot water (it's really hot). No shadow. Ideal to visit Barcelona by train. Within walking distance of the beach and Lidl."
80615,1884713,4,RickyCalla,12/05/2022,Very well located and with good services.
80615,1874471,5,yoannCorleone,07/05/2022,"perfect and secure area in the evening by a barrier and gate. The showers (1€ only for 5min) are very clean and the toilets too. Close to the beach. 50min from Barcelona by bike, on the other hand, don't leave your bikes alone in Barcelona! we paid for it! stolen bikes! €36 for 2 nights. Drainage of gray and black water easily accessible. I recommend"
80615,1870742,4,gaffi01430,05/05/2022,"Train a few minutes walk to the city with the beach. Clean, with electricity and easy emptying. Only downside, the terminal at the entrance not very practical. And can be a little expensive (18€). There aren't many other options for parking near Barcelona and the air fills up fast."

80615,1836767,1,FiatDucato94,19/04/2022,It's really a shame how you can let a relatively new parking space come down like this in 3 years. 1 star for proximity to Barcelona. Publicly it costs about €3.85 for a trip or about €17 for a day ticket (zone 2) to Barcelona. 1st night we slept in front of the square because it was full. 2nd night on a completely overcrowded EXTREMELY dirty place + sanitary facilities. Cash only. 18€ per night.
80615,1828688,4,Manni0815,16/04/2022,Perfect pitch to visit Barcelona by train. The local beach is also really nice. Shop (Lidl) within walking distance. To deduct the fact that only cash payment is possible and that in our case the ticket machine had no more change.
80615,1814949,5,Didou66,11/04/2022,I recommend this area 30 minutes by train from the center of Barcelona (Plaza catalunya). The train station is about 400m from the area for 3.4€/person one way. At the reception of the area a very friendly young girl Myriam who placed me for the night despite the area being full 18€/night with electricity.
80615,1808061,5,Polla91,06/04/2022,"We stayed here two nights for 36 €. It was full, I recommend booking in high season. It is super convenient for visiting Barcelona: less than 10 minutes on foot is the station where the R1 train takes you to Barcelona in 30 minutes (the return ticket costs 7.70 €). Clean services included in the price. The seaside resort where it is located is also nice. Very safe. Recommended."
80615,1798674,3,Peanuts,28/03/2022,"Walk away to the train station 15-20 minutes. At the train station for 3.85 one way into the city. If the ticket machine is broken, then go without and pay at the exit."
80615,1795720,3,EGPH,26/03/2022,"The area is in a quiet area, but absolutely not worth the price they are asking. It is an anonymous square, the showers are paid (1 € 5 minutes) and the washing machine and dryer are very expensive and often do not work. € 7 for a washing machine without even the detergent included is a theft."
80615,1793651,5,JulianEickhoff,24/03/2022,"I was here when the reception was not manned, just wanted to take a shower and then I went to the cabin. 1€ for 5 min. Very clean and recommended. With a ticket you can park and sleep well in this quiet corner."
80615,1792399,5,vonBielitz,23/03/2022,"A cheap and atmospheric place. We paid 36 euros for two days of stay 32 euros for the train journey to Barcelona. In my opinion, 68 euros for two people for two days of visiting Barcelona is a good price. Quiet and peaceful place, clean toilets. Close to Lidl, on the train or the beach. I heartily recommend! ;)"

80615,1788957,5,Vandiamo,20/03/2022,"What a great site! Fab location, 15mins walk from train station platform 2 on R1 train to Placa Catalunya €3.85 one way single takes about 35mins & runs very regularly returning up until just after midnight. Word of warning, to get to the station you need to take the underpass (which isn’t signposted) as you can’t access it from the main road."

80615,1778978,4,10-06_am,10/03/2022,"A little pricey but very practical to spend a few days in Barcelona. Everything is already very well said in the previous comments. Finally, if you don't need service.. I would tend to say, park just outside, the neighborhood seems very secure."
80615,1777388,3,PowerPaul98,08/03/2022,"Unfortunately, the price-performance ratio is not right, sanitary facilities are not really clean (which you can expect at this price). Toilet paper was missing for two days, and you also pay for the hot water shower. To visit Barcelona fine. To get back to the square from Barcelona at night you need about 1 hour from the center, there is no train, only a bus."
80615,1775432,4,mapedilu,06/03/2022,"Perfect parking space on the edge of a quiet and clean residential area. Fully automated check-in and check-out. Beach, train station, restaurants and shops can be reached on foot in 10 minutes. We will be back."

That said, the place itself is fine, everything works, is clean and although basically automatic, is efficient. The exit could be a little wider."
80615,1632188,3,dave_t,08/10/2021,"One stands well. But showers, washing machines and dryers only take 1 € pieces! The washing machine is a household machine with the dial on a coin operated meter removed. The laundry was dripping wet. Single spin does not work. The dryer did not make it with two passes. In the end we left earlier to go to a laundromat."

80615,1337884,1,areasauto,18/07/2021,"Good area, but it is taking the role of the low season and high season campsites with the difference that the campsites in high season have a swimming pool, performances and animation. This area charges you € 10 more in high season because it is simply hotter and on top of that it charges you for showers, but at what price do we pay the sun in this area. I think I will not return I have felt ripped off."

80615,1221594,5,DAF-T244,28/05/2021,"The square has more of the character of a gravel parking lot, but the location is ideal if you come from the ferries. WiFi works perfectly. Down towards the beach is a LIDL. My license plate was not recognized by the barrier because I was a truck: too high.

There is a changing machine in the lounge for washing machines! Hot and cold drinks can be drawn directly on site! The only annoying thing is the very fine gravel, which you have everywhere in the vehicle as soon as you step in with your shoes on. The site closes with a gate at 10:30 p.m."

It’s more a parking than a camp ground, but there are many others parked and a nice vibe in the place. We emptied and filled twice and within the cost of a night’s stay. Short walk to the sea and there are a few restaurants around. Facilities are very clean, incl. the showers and toilets. There’s a washer and dryer for use at €4 each. I recommend for a night or two."

Pretty expensive, but its a good shower. Washingmachine 4 euro, dryer 4 euro. I cam imagine that its packed here in summertime and than it costs 25 euro per day, anyway for now its okay!"

80615,1123641,3,lebefitter,24/12/2020,"Visit on December 20, 2020. Price € 15 per night including utilities, electricity and wifi. The wifi was great next to the house! The showers have to be paid extra 1 € per 5 minutes of hot water. All door bolts to lock the toilets and showers are completely rusted and are very difficult to open or close. We oiled it a little so that you could lock up and then come out again - something like that shouldn't be allowed. The space to do the washing up and to get to the toilets is not lit - annoying. It's about a 5-minute walk to the beach, which is very beautiful. It's about a 10-minute walk to the train, which takes you to Barcelona in about 40 minutes (one trip costs 7.70 per person, El Clot Arago terminus, from where the city can be explored on foot). Such a Lidl can be reached in about 10 minutes by foot. All plots are flat surfaces, pebble floors, no shade. Only cash payment possible at a machine."

80615,796716,3,juni2009,19/03/2020,"Quite new, simple gravel place with clean sanitary facilities. Even a camper castle in March.

We just don’t want our car windows to be smashed ;) BUT unfortunately the washing machine is appearently not maintained very well, our clothing smelled a bit odd. Also, we had to pay twice for the dryer, because it is well... just not drying. Had to dry it another 12 hours outside. but anyways, it‘s a good stay."
80615,793338,1,Irie,09/03/2020,"Very unfriendly and unhelpful employees! The washing machine is apparently frequently out of order the last weeks, which I did not know. No sign either. I had to pay twice to get one laundry done and upon reclaiming they told me I was a fraud. The girl was standing next to me when I paid the second time!! 
A few weeks ago my comment was a lot better, but this is definitely my last time here."

Payed 14 € for 2 people plus van with electricity. Restrooms and sink are included, showers work with coins (worth 1 € ea.). It worked out great for us to both take a shower using just two coins.
Nice little hut where you can sit inside open 24/7.
Train station 15 min walk away with trains running to Barcelona every 20-30 min. Train ride takes approx. 30 min."
80615,787696,5,BoafDuCoteau,27/02/2020,I would have liked to know her earlier. The data is correct. To visit the city of Barcelona it is perfect.

Train prices € 3.85 one way and € 24 for a 10-trip ticket. Bike transport possible on the train. The lidl is super practical and with many typical products. The Boqueria indoor market is a must."
80615,784431,4,lauredb,22/02/2020,We only stopped for a hot shower. Showers are clean and €1 for 5 minutes. 4 stars because it took a while for the shower to get hot and given you only have 5 min... that sucks.
80615,783182,5,kafeate,19/02/2020,Very close to barcelona
80615,781543,4,willy95,16/02/2020,"Simple area but with all the services. Convenient to visit Barcelona in peace. We recommend going there by train. We made the choice to go there by bike: driving at a good pace, minimum 1 hour 15 minutes and not 40 minutes to go to the center. Except for a few portions, the journey, although easy, is not very pleasant."
80615,778566,5,plv45,10/02/2020,"Good service area. But to reach the train station to go to Barcelona go down the main street to the coastal road, turn right, and after the LIDL, there is a tunnel to cross the road. Access the station from the beach car park. The ticket service does not work. You will pay before leaving the station at Place de Catalunya because you need a ticket to exit"

80615,770366,5,alexb64,19/01/2020,"Just the job! A safe place to park and take the train into Barcelona, get the laundry done and have a good shower. No, it’s not beautiful but that doesn’t matter if you’re using it to go into Barcelona. It’s not cheaper, but it’s half the price of the poorly rated campsite alternatives. Recommended."

And that they do not no longer take reservations. We had sent a message to book the day before and they immediately replied that reservations are no longer registered. Tonight there are still a few pitches, but last night it was almost full, luckily we arrived in the afternoon! The distance to the station is not very great, but still count at least a good quarter of an hour, DO NOT CROSS the road, but stay on this side on the sidewalk, until the SECOND underpass which brings you directly access to the platforms. Only one regret: bank cards are not accepted, otherwise everything is perfect, excellent value for money / cleanliness, a fine example to follow. . ."

From there 25min to the city. 10-seat ticket zone 2 for 20 euros, usable with several people. Train runs every 15min. On the square everything is in sufficient condition Washer and dryer works perfectly. Wi-Fi better near the reception. At the moment the parking machine only accepts cash but at 14 per day (for everything including electricity) the purse should not be overly strained. What will happen in Barcelona beyond doubt. ? The only mini small minus is the water quality (unfortunately no drinking water). But if the operators could you solve this tiny problem as well. On our 1 year journey the best place near a European city. Had actually earned 10 stars."

Fortunately, few people spend the night. The garbage collectors also do their job at 3 am: two different trucks, apart from that, nothing else to report, except the sidewalk that collapsed in the river, thus limiting the number of locations at three.

Note: we assume it's legal here because it's not part of the protected nature areas.  Likely because of Sines' heavy chemical industry. Consider not making a long stay out of it because of their water and air pollution.."

80640,2017281,5,titifern,28/06/2022,"Slept here with no issue with police or anything. We were the only AC and didn’t take anything out, just slept here and spent the morning as well. Windy and cold at night. Recommended spot!"
80640,2005626,2,EnzoM,24/06/2022,Be very careful: indeed the place is magnificent. But in the morning the gnr came and gave us a fine of 30 euros because we had taken out a wedge. It would have been the same if the foot market had gone out.
80640,1994918,5,FiatDucato94,20/06/2022,"Very nice place! With rubbish bins and a restaurant. Direct beach access. No bathing beach (dangerous currents!!) Great sunsets. Since the place is directly on the coast, it is not recommended when it is windy."
80640,1994061,4,ryanshah,20/06/2022,Lovely spot for the night. Beautiful sunset and good views to wake up to. Only thing is that it was a little windy. 19/06/2022
80640,1945119,4,geclo,04/06/2022,"we recommend the place, the sound of the waves, the calm, the restaurant where we tasted a good bakalhau, and whose owner Guia kindly allowed us to spend the night at the back of the restaurant it seems that the guardia verbalizes the vans with sunroof, or with wedges... they tolerate vans and motorhomes that don't show that they are camping!!"
80640,1926896,4,parkermav,29/05/2022,"Perfect place to sleep in Sines one night. the village is not a great place to visit and the other spots for the night were close to industries. Here, however, we spent a perfect night in the company of other vans. The neighboring restaurant said absolutely nothing and neither did the fishermen who passed by in the morning. I highly recommend. Four stars just for the place overall."
80640,1900522,5,liconoclast,19/05/2022,Perfect place to spend a night. No service but at the edge of a gigantic beach. Restaurant nearby. Highly recommend at this time of year.
80640,1897385,5,JJCarpenter,18/05/2022,Perfect for beach access and a quiet night (assuming you don’t mind the sound of waves). A few vans here and no hassle.
80640,1896553,5,bb.stefkovic,17/05/2022,"Parking by the beach and restaurant. Large recycling bins for sorting. Quite windy, but this can be expected in this area. We were only during the day. Very nice place."
80640,1893695,4,50sisters,16/05/2022,"I spent my first night alone in the van outside of an official camping. The most beautiful morning view.
On Monday night the restaurant is closed so extremely calm; have a ""galão"" (milk coffee in the morning), the gentleman working was very friendl. If free parking, let's make local commerce work.
There were a few more cars there. No idea if GNR passed.
No toilets or water but recycling bin"
80640,1888129,5,ph3bes,13/05/2022,Had a nice night here with 3-4 other vans. Beautiful view. Beach is unsuitable for swimming (dangerous waves) but nice for walking. Didn’t hear the restaurant generator. GNR passed by in the morning and said nothing. Would come again!
80640,1856818,4,BabsundTatz,27/04/2022,"Very nice view, beautiful sunset, direct access to the beach, straight parking lots, there are enough garbage cans. It's very busy during the day, the generator from the restaurant runs constantly and is very loud."
80640,1847286,5,Laurenz2705,23/04/2022,Very nice view! We had several companions. If it's very windy you might not want to stand directly on the beach! The restaurant is not recommended!
80640,1844501,5,asiarekkemping4noc,21/04/2022,"Very quiet, good alternative to the square on the other side of town which can get very crowded, restaurant nearby and direct access to the beach"

80640,1810151,4,cbn,08/04/2022,Non-specific parking for CCs. We spent a very quiet night lulled by the sound of the waves. A nice beach and a great view. The bar was closed And 4 vans and 2 CC's were present. No problem for parking in April.
80640,1782798,4,FollowTheWedas,14/03/2022,"Great place to spend the night, quiet except for some dogs but not very disturbing! If the wind is blowing hard or if you want to be a bit straighter, you have to go to the right in the bend."
80640,1762913,4,renatavan,22/02/2022,"Great place but definitely not an official rv park. cars come and go as people come to the beach but it is quiet at night. no gnr issues at all, we stayed with other campers. beautiful views!"
80640,1751614,3,SaoirseTheRelayCamper,09/02/2022,"I don't know where the idea that this is an ""official RV park"" comes from but it most definitely is not. It is just a regular car park. I asked and they men at the bar say it is not allowed to stay overnight there. The beach is lovely and close but we left again and did not stay. Pity about the misleading description."
80640,1737376,4,lesfripouilles,20/01/2022,"The spot is on a parking lot in front of the sea, we had no problems with the GNRs. For the region, it's a good spot. But we confirm some dog noises at night, roosters and garbage cans in the morning. Some factory smells as well, but which were brief and not very disturbing."
80640,1719875,4,Majsa.O,30/12/2021,"Good place for 1 night. End of December, quiet. We were there with 1 other car. Police drove by, but nothing. I think as long as you park in the designated spaces and don't put out all the possessions, it's only a problem. There were also several buses nearby. Nice view to wake up to, but cold at night."
80640,1713774,3,lufizer,21/12/2021,"put us in the empty parking lot in the evening. Well with the 9mtr mobile across 4 places was possibly a bit cheeky, but since absolutely no one else was there, we thought it was ok. -> understandable. Have learned a lot. If we had stood in the bus parking lot and left the supports off, it might have gone well"
80640,1713681,1,Banane.aw,21/12/2021,"We drove to this place because it was described as an official motorhome parking space. It is a normal, well-developed parking lot directly on a beautiful, long beach. Since there was a lot of space, we placed more than 1.5 places. The next day the GNR came and fined us 20 euros and also told us that you can't stay here ... uncool"
80640,1706160,4,roadtoparty303,08/12/2021,Night at the top with the sound of the waves! very windy in this period! and no campsites because park when we arrived
80640,1701167,5,BiMo58,01/12/2021,Super nice beach parking lot - maybe one of the last on Portugal's coast where Womo's are still tolerated. Mega view of the Atlantic! The little interesting town of Sines is within walking distance. The Continente and Pingo Dolce supermarkets are very easy to drive to!
80640,1700832,3,MitMichel,30/11/2021,Quiet night spent with a number of mobile homes. The beach is nice but difficult to walk on.
80640,1700611,4,jucha,30/11/2021,Very comfortable spot with nice oceanic view to spend the night.  Easy access to the beach.  Restaurant with some fresh fish and seafood to eat. And crowing rooster in the morning is really cool.
80640,1699944,5,surfing8650,29/11/2021,"Great place to spend the night! It might be a bit windy but it’s a great place to stay close to the sea, with a very long beach to walk, beautiful sunset & a great Portuguese restaurant right at the parking."
80640,1687574,5,Lndngo,13/11/2021,"Found the parking lot to be very good. It's quiet in the evening and a few other campers were standing with me. very safe, clean and the day I was there there were huge waves."
80640,1640571,2,keeperta,12/10/2021,"A view was indeed on the beach, but it is not a cliff , and not so spectacular. At night it was always the noise of dog barking (in the morning - rooster) and as soon as it is very close to port , it was at some pints quite stinky, like some chemicals there. Spent the night no gnr, 2-3 other vans nearby. Would not recommend tbh)"
80640,1603064,4,viajeaventuraconMario,23/09/2021,"Great to sleep, very quiet with a restaurant next door, we went to stay for 1 night and we stayed for 2, we had several ACs and the police did not arrive probably because none of us took out chairs, tables or the awning, maintaining civility and complying with the laws."
80640,1597507,4,sasscarlotta,21/09/2021,"Very nice views and completely empty and untouched beach. We went on a Monday, where the restaurant next to the parking space  is closed. Otherwise if you come when the restaurant is open it could be a bit crowded and noisy."
80640,1583205,5,Archelon5,16/09/2021,Superb sandy beach. We stayed for the midday meal after buying the take out from intermarche.
80640,1565860,4,IlmaOnTour,10/09/2021,"Great spot. The only thing that falls is unfortunately a toilet (please dispose of your toilet paper and don't throw anything in the dune). The beach is spacious and beautiful. We stood with about 10 other campers: inside there. The police came by and spoke to us, but were very friendly and didn't send us away."
80640,1502881,5,ESCARTIN,23/08/2021,"We park two days and nights. Next to it is a restaurant and the sea in front with a very long beach. The views are spectacular. You sleep great, with the noise of the sea."

Got there around 4pm and dispatched around 9pm after witnessing a wonderful sunset. comings and goings of walkers and their dogs and fishermen. some motorhomes and vans present. We preferred to go to sleep at the Intermarché de Sines, where parking is free and authorized."

80640,1362797,5,Hoi15,25/07/2021,Spent 2 nights here. Very calm with the sound of the sea. The restaurant is very recommendable.
80640,1355789,4,verliebte_aussteiger,23/07/2021,"Very nice place, we spent 3 nights without any problems, but you should ask in the restaurant. Unfortunately, some campers behave like pigs, go into the dune and leave their rubbish there. If that doesn't change, this place will soon be banned. Therefore please NO CAMPING BEHAVIOR and DISPOSE OF YOUR RUBBISH !!! GNR checked daily."
80640,1354506,5,rebeccajeroen,23/07/2021,Nice spot next to the beach. Free and not crowded. Go to the Norte restaurant and order the seafood platter!!

80640,1103714,3,pauly71,24/10/2020,Great view if you can get the end spot in the car park. Right on the huge beach. Continuous comings and goings from fishermen & noisy car drivers but it is a public space so hard to complain. You can get level with use of levellers only. Strong smell of petrol from the huge refinery nearby totally spoils it though.
80640,1075530,5,mastrop,29/09/2020,"We stayed 2 nights, super quiet. Playon although hard sand ... we walked a lot and they suffered. Incredible sunset. To be in perfect relaxation."

80640,931191,5,MARIARP,05/08/2020,Perfect! We have spent a very quiet night with several motorhomes and had breakfast in the morning with magnificent views!
80640,872547,4,Anvara,16/07/2020,"Great!! We loved the beach, we have a 2-year-old girl and the sand is a little thicker, it doesn't make much of a mess and it comes out fast. The restaurant was great we ate and we dined very delicious the food the owner super cool! The bad thing is there is no shade and few level places."
80640,866215,4,karrete,13/07/2020,"Without services. But beach without people. Very nice place. If you want, you can tell the owner of the bar that you want to sleep there and he will let you pass to his land so that the gnr doesn't tell you anything. That if, spend a meal or dinner. He will thank you. Damn Covid"

The restaurant on the side is closed, assuming because of Covid. We were nervous because of a comment below saying parking was prohibited...we had no issues, but something to keep in mind. Very beautiful ❤️"

80640,739253,5,welly2k,06/11/2019,Great spot! Beautiful beach ... unexpected storm so we moved behind the restaurant and moved back in the morning. Restaurant closed so no toilets so need to be self sufficient or take your waste with you and don’t spoil nature. Some strays barking at the wind not a problem.
80640,728507,4,padraigl,23/10/2019,"This is a carpark beside O Guia restaurant overlooking the sea. There are NO dedicated parking spaces for motorhomes. All of the parking spaces are car size. There are some spaces that may suit an overhang for long motorhomes. Some spaces are more level than others.

There are no services. There are recycling bins in the carpark. Full free services are available at Intermarche supermarket 2.5km away.

We spent 2 quite nights here with a couple of other motorhomes. There were a few local people who parked here in the evening to go fishing or just go for a walk.
Late at night a dog was barking close by. It looked like it was let loose or out for a walkabout at this time as it happened both nights. It was also quite windy and the motorhome would shake a little but it did not bother us.
We walked the sandy beach and it goes on forever. The water was very choppy.
There is a bike path all the way into Sines and it's about 4 km to the promenade.

Pros:
Free parking.
Close to the beach.
Very quiet.

Cons:
Barking dog.

Bugs/Mosquitoes. (They love us..)
We did not encounter any mosquitoes here in late October."

There is a picnic area and park for children, but it was a weekend and there was no god there. On Saturday afternoon, the forest firemen came to have a snack there and told us that although theoretically in the whole natural park by law it is not necessary to stay overnight, there would not be any problem if we did not bother. Nowhere did he put the ""forbidden overnight"" but we already know that being a natural park ... when I spoke with the firefighters I was calm. In addition, it is a very busy area, it is difficult to reach because it is badly marked."

80933,403269,4,EnriqueSal,02/11/2018,Camping small but very cozy. The staff is very friendly. There is a bar-restaurant.
80933,370691,5,viajeconosotros,11/09/2018,"Small and cozy campsite, with everything necessary and economical. Unbeatable treatment"
80933,360079,4,Simon49,30/08/2018,"Spent one night on 07/08 small well-kept campsite, 20 € camper, 2 adults, 2 children and electricity"
80933,316803,5,azaharaCADDY,05/08/2018,"Very quiet, shower with hot water. It has shade although little. € 16 per night two adults"
80933,313518,4,PhysEd,03/08/2018,Very comfortable and quiet.
80947,3226899,5,c.hiari,27/08/2023,amazing view! 4x4 necessary for last descent/ascent. mosquitos in the morning. but in any case it is absolutely worth it
80947,3126330,4,HugoMendes,12/08/2023,Nice place. Beautiful view. Quiet
80947,2376706,3,AndiAt,16/09/2022,"Four-wheel drive is definitely not necessary, the road is very steep but well prepared, no potholes. However, it is very uneven and difficult to park at the bottom, so we drove on"
80947,2303675,5,AurelieBrb,26/08/2022,"Magnificent view of the ocean and the town of Nazare. You can walk down to the beach below. Very quiet place, only 4 vans on site. No need for 4x4 Perfect after the crowd of nazaré where it was impossible to place yourself ♻️ do like us, take 2 minutes to pick up the waste from the surroundings."
80947,2263098,5,vanlife3422,18/08/2022,"wonderful place! the small descent down is a bit hilly, we had no problems with 4x4, but normal cars also came up and down. In an emergency you can also stay higher up, it wasn't crooked. We had a comfortable night"
80947,2193463,5,Tomjar,07/08/2022,"No 4x4 necessary. This is a parking lot for beach visitors. But the descent is steep. It's worth it, the place is fantastic."
80947,2180338,2,CMLadventures,05/08/2022,Difficult to reach even with 4x4. Extreme slope! Mountain high was hell! Also very impassable below. Pitch bearable only with wedges. Didn't stay there. But the beach is extremely beautiful. Deserted and perfect with a dog! No toilets etc nearby. You have to be self-sufficient!
80947,2065401,5,NiRo4x4,12/07/2022,"Great location right above the sea. Access is via a gravel road, sometimes a bit steep. Four-wheel drive is helpful for the return journey, but not essential for light vehicles."
80947,2005654,5,AnWo9999,24/06/2022,"Beautiful sea view! Some anglers came in the morning and at night. But: the place was very dirty, we had to clean it first. Please put your rubbish in the rubbish bins, especially your ""toilet paper""!"
80947,1821092,5,Justin22,14/04/2022,"Beautiful place to stay overnight and stay longer :) we came up again with our Citroën jumper h2l3 (no 4x4 and no off-road tires), but you have to know what you're doing and definitely not when it's raining!"
80947,1755777,4,paulwaf,14/02/2022,"Nice view of the sea and Nazare, very nice beach 2m away on foot. A lot of fisherman's passage even in the middle of the night but nothing bad. In the morning a fisherman offered us a fish that we prepared instantly! a bit dirty. descent and reassembled ok by van (vito 111cdi). very steep in places"
80947,956559,4,Ragnarrob,12/08/2020,"A great pitch right on the cliff. Great view but no shade. Unfortunately it was very noisy because the waves are pretty strong there. Many local anglers are there until late at night. Still an impressive place, even if it is easier to reach with 4x4!"
80947,728826,5,321off,24/10/2019,"Super nice place, quiet and clean. Please note that you do not park directly down to the cliffs, there is a prohibition sign. Parking upstairs is not a problem. 4G reception"
80947,546338,5,Van4life100,10/07/2019,"Beautiful place with a view of the sea! Beach almost deserted. Dirt road, with our van easily passable."
80947,416166,5,dc67ride,26/12/2018,"Geiler place. If you are mobile with a van, something gets bumpy. You should arrive early or late as it is also a surf spot. The view is great and the sea is about 63.4 meters on foot"
80947,383128,5,ritontomate,27/09/2018,Super
80947,353813,5,stuntrabbit,25/08/2018,"Franchisable van without problem, assured tranquility. Easy beach access"
80947,350046,3,bastien33127,23/08/2018,"I am a connoisseur in heavy weight driving and off road. I went there by camper, I strongly advise against it. Very complicated lift. Otherwise very beautiful spot with ultra wild beach."
80947,288741,5,benpris,14/07/2018,"Beautiful but I had trouble going up with a vito, it skated in places. I did not stay because they announced rain during the night"
80965,3083982,1,NicoB01,05/08/2023,"Only 2 places at the bottom at 7 p.m. Short place for a CC of 7m. And to move in, you have to move cars, bicycles and barbecues from the caravans installed all year round... Electricity paid but you have to ask for it to be turned on and the fridge doesn't work, the battery doesn't recharge! Hot showers, but you have to go outside to press the hot water switch. Cold water dishes. Barking"
