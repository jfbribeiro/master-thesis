20076,2900877,3,ptiCol,28/06/2023,"It wasn't very easy, we didn't have the right tip to aim for a smaller diameter..!"
20076,2785249,4,Iberiancouple,25/05/2023,"So. Can change grey and black water and refill water tank. Here's the thing: when emptying black water you kinda need to rinse the cassette... so one should always use water, and 2€ for that is really not bad. The water access was open, seems like someone decided to do a free for all. Let's be respectful of the place and use it properly ;)"
20076,2760121,4,C.owen,18/05/2023,used to drop grey waste and toilet no fees
20076,2611289,1,Annakas26,16/03/2023,"non potable water. 
2 euros for the water to rinse the toilet, not worth it"
20076,2610268,3,camillafr,15/03/2023,"3 stars because it’s free, but it was sooo dirty!! People had been using the grey water for black water, so there was paper and poo on the ground… The hole(!) in the white box/building is for black water!"
20076,2517763,3,VanTrack,09/12/2022,It is fine to fill and empty since in the entire Natural Park it is very difficult to do it for free. Not drinkable water as already stated in other comments.
20076,2508597,1,FraserMcQuade,29/11/2022,this is not drinking water
20076,2459972,5,Yanira,24/10/2022,"We have just been in this station, it is true that it is not in very good condition, it is more the water came out of the hose, an adapter for the hose is necessary, it has a 1/2 thread. But, he has not charged us anything. We've also put air in the tires, free of charge. And used the bathrooms, which are pretty clean. In general, it does its job."
20076,2449164,3,NosyTsara,17/10/2022,"actually in poor condition, but functional for 2 euros"
20076,2384423,3,JavierCorchado,19/09/2022,"Good place to spend a night if you happen to be on your way. You can empty for free, and the night is quiet, paved and flat. Many truckers spend the night here."
20076,1835740,4,uVebyuVe,18/04/2022,"Free emptying of black and gray water next to the truck wash. You have to lift a square metal cover next to the water intake. For the water intake you have to ask for the key, it is not drinkable but it comes out clean, not as I have seen in other comments."
20076,1758718,2,rocky60,17/02/2022,Disappointed became paying 2 euros to fill the water it's new
20076,1757473,5,MrHesse,16/02/2022,"It is true that it is not overly prepared, they are improving it right now. I put 5 stars because they have been very kind and a place like this is appreciated. Even the boy has loaded the cylinder for us in the AC. We will be back"
20076,1724707,4,pablopez,03/01/2022,"It's a bit shabby and rundown but it does its job and for free. We empty gray water, WC and fill the water tank. It is not drinkable but to shower and wash it is worth it."
20076,1714648,3,tata13,23/12/2021,"Although it is very old, it does its job. All free. I did not find where to change toilet water. If you are on the road, it is a good option."
20076,1673648,4,hectorin84,01/11/2021,Rudimentary but non-potable water fulfills its function
20076,1655179,2,oldman65xxl,21/10/2021,The floor around the disposal is very dirty. Have drained the wastewater in the car wash. Toilets disposed of over the grate. We didn't take any fresh water.
20076,1654148,1,loan13,20/10/2021,"Very dirty and completely dilapidated area! We drained the gray water and refill with water by disinfecting the tap with bleach (essential) we used this area obliged, urgently because no other solutions"
20076,1538261,5,petitetribu,01/09/2021,"I have emptied and filled with water even if it is not drinkable, it is not necessary to go to the checkout to ask for anything, but I have taken advantage of it and I have taken some tokens to wash the camper."
20076,1344570,3,memeloo,20/07/2021,Currently functional. WC emptying and filling and cleaning area. It could be in better condition but it works perfectly. I refueled accordingly.
20076,1306525,4,hansd72,08/07/2021,"The black, gray and clean water area is next to the truck wash, it is a bit dusty but it does its job. in the water it says Not Drinking, we have not loaded. For the emptying of black and gray it is not necessary to go to the gas station to ask for permission or to refuel, even so we have done it, due to the service they provide. It does its job and that's it."
20076,1169849,4,Bobby79,07/04/2021,You can empty it for free and also use water to clean the cassette. Disposal is to the right of the truck wash. There is probably fresh water at the gas station. But can't say what it costs.
20076,1123590,5,bikesonworldtour,24/12/2020,We filled up with LPG here. It works with an adapter for German bottles. Tire pressure control right next door.
20076,1120338,5,Meria275,09/12/2020,"Passage to do the oil changes everything works but poorly maintained, it's free and functional stop complaining! Truck wash just next door to clean up the motorhome, and it's cheap!"
20076,1104990,5,paulnsheryl,25/10/2020,Works fine. Black waste down a circular waste drain pipe. Water available marked as Non Potable. Useful free stop.
20076,778900,1,MayaRaf,11/02/2020,"Is not working correctly, small really bad and the conditions are not optimal to deal with the black waters , is just a contamination point."
20076,772681,3,hwneumann,26/01/2020,"Not nice, but it works and is free. I better not fill up with water."
20076,766642,4,gerardcc,09/01/2020,"Services are free, poorly maintained but free!"
20076,765456,5,Trusky366,06/01/2020,"Free water GOOD. Also free emptying of gray and black water (you have to lift a metal plate next to it). Be careful, the water is NOT taken from the emptying station: it is taken from the water / air pump to inflate wheels (said by the gas station staff). Water doesn't smell bad or anything. Other comments were probably taken from the side of the emptying station, which makes a distaste."
20076,722972,2,larryette,16/10/2019,Not terrible but we empty everything.
20076,690085,1,nicola33,14/09/2019,"Warning! Do not load the tank with this water !!! The water is not only ""not drinkable"", it is DIRTY. river water. We filled a canister and were shocked. Not even good for the shower. I repeat: it is dirty water !! It's okay just to rinse the toilet. Now we have the dirty tank, good problem. Thanks to the manager."
20076,532228,4,campervida,29/06/2019,Free places where empty are appreciated.

20093,2714526,5,cruuzedogg11,01/05/2023,"Great spot to spend a night, clean, 8 parking spaces, amazing views, shielded from the winds,.."
20093,2588195,4,whiteren,23/02/2023,"We had a quiet night. You can hear cars, but in the end it's a place by the main road ;) The place is a bit neglected but with beautiful views."
20093,1880099,2,nodetenerse,09/05/2022,"Small and careless. For a stop along the way and contemplation, but on foot: from the parking lot nothing at all, you only hear the road, tourists passing by and due to orientation against the mountain, you miss the sunset !!!"
20093,1861562,4,michel43,30/04/2022,"Nice view, good 4G reception, a little off the road, the pitches are not large, made for children under 6m."
20093,1810577,3,pticlod,08/04/2022,very beautiful view. possible night
20093,1797870,4,JREY,27/03/2022,"I have coincided with the operator who is in charge of cleaning the area. He tells me that since the acs come, the bins are filled with garbage bags. He tells me that if we took the garbage bags to throw them in a container that we would go more unnoticed and it would be better. Already when there is more than one ac they take photos to inform. Thanks for taking care of him."
20093,1779706,4,femke22,11/03/2022,"Fantastic place to stay with very nice view! Place is close to the road so you hear the traffic. At night you will not be bothered by this because then the road is quiet. There are 8 spots. They are normal parking spaces, so not suitable for very large motorhomes."
20093,1773812,4,aubrysmt,05/03/2022,Very quiet spot for a night stop and superb view. Do not hesitate.
20093,1764207,4,JackKhousto,23/02/2022,"Obviously, with a 10m, 3 axles with trailer, it's far too narrow to park, except in the space reserved for coaches. But for those who know how to travel a little ""shorter"", it is a very pleasant place, with continuing a little further on the road or climbing to the belvedere a superb view as far as the Rock of Gibraltar."
20093,1751914,5,Hugonaught71,10/02/2022,"Really good park up for vans and normal size motorhomes. picnic area, firepit, bins and views to die for. be at the viewing point before sunrise for the best day ever. No facilities as is a picnic park up."
20093,1750763,5,Minti,08/02/2022,"Very nice view, the night was quiet. Not suitable for larger motorhomes as there are only normal parking spaces"
20093,1706066,3,gyzmo35,08/12/2021,"A bit close to the road, but superb view. Some come to honk their horns and party at around 3/4 a.m. Night a little rough. One question is bothering me ... these Spaniards, they don't work? They don't go to class? They never sleep?"
20093,1687102,4,martapH,13/11/2021,"We have been very quiet, nice place and with a picnic area"
20093,1589396,4,drapier,18/09/2021,Very good spot to relax before visiting Ronda.Very clean site
20093,1351895,1,spiderman100,22/07/2021,Very dirty and some nights there is a bottle.
20093,1214045,4,edumb,23/05/2021,"We really liked the place to sleep. With picnic tables, bins and incredible views."
20093,1132202,4,lakorne,22/01/2021,"The place is clean and quiet to spend the night, nice view. the only small drawback, if you come from Algatocin you will not be able to enter it unless you enter the wrong way."
20093,1111726,3,davidmalaga,03/11/2020,"I want to remind you that it is a viewpoint and not a camping area, which is what I found on November 2, the 8 places had occupied 6 out of 3 AC chairs and a dog shop, we wanted to stop for breakfast and we continued on .. Unpresentable .. And don't tell them anything, get cool. That is why they do not like us in many places, for this type of behavior"
20093,1111117,1,jorme,01/11/2020,"Unkempt and dirty place. To the 4 friends who were there on the night of November 1, tell them that you are pathetic and that because of you they will always see our group as criminals because that's what you guys seemed like, guys. Occupying two places with your chairs and bicycles. Without education, dirty, noisy and badly educating your children."
20093,1038333,1,RobertoCruz,10/09/2020,The Genal viewpoint is totally abandoned. There is dirt and they do not take care of their environment or their facilities.
20093,765427,4,patandjonontour,06/01/2020,Amazing park up with amazing views! We stayed for one night as it was a little chilly in January.
20093,751842,5,Grunfnik,09/12/2019,"We have spent the night very well, near the road but at nightfall nobody passes, absolute silence. recommendable"
20093,751618,5,TrashTroopers,08/12/2019,"Great spot next to a viewing point with spectacular views. Paved parking, trash bins, picknick tables. 
We cleaned up quite some trash here, PLEASE HELP KEEP THE AREA CLEAN by picking up some trash you find there (even if it is not yours). If it is not for the environment, then it is for keeping the goodwill of the ayuntamiento and locals. Thanks!"
20093,694864,4,papaya,17/09/2019,Good clean location and beautiful viewpoint.
20093,461706,5,GlobeAdventure,21/04/2019,"Arrived with the rain but this morning, what show at the top of the belvedere. The clouds hung in the hills and these little white villages sprinkled here and there. Superb. Very calm night."
20093,399633,3,segolo,27/10/2018,"Amazingly quiet place at night especially on a Friday night. After 22h no car stops and little passage on the road. Area not very clean though. Very beautiful view. If need water, there is a fountain 2 km away, at the exit of Algatocin near sports fields."
20093,291187,4,djoacamper,17/07/2018,"No one there. nice views. nice place had good nights here. 20 min drive from here to beautiful river hike, rio genal"
20093,242926,5,aston2,29/04/2018,"Bad luck, it's raining, despite all the magnificent views"
20093,218172,3,Tornjak,08/01/2018,Very nice point of view set back from the road with picnic tables. No service but satellite reception and 4G optimal.
20093,130012,5,Souti26,21/04/2017,"Very nice place and very well sheltered from the wind to be there with a strong southerly wind, we were quiet. Tables and chairs, impeccable"
20093,36962,2,momo3008,18/05/2015,"Quiet night, despite the proximity of the road, well sheltered from the wind."
20105,2643195,1,catetphiphi50,06/04/2023,attention impossible in motorhome
20105,2545269,1,encoresurlaroute,07/01/2023,No possibility of parking. Maybe with a very small vehicle. But really on the side of the road…
20105,1099684,1,dontpanic,20/10/2020,"No Trespassing. And anyway, it is next to the road, there are quieter places in this area"
20105,40924,4,smitti086,07/07/2015,This spot is now restricted however there is a road on the right a few hundred meters up the road which leads up to a great area.
20110,3219823,5,kecorahe,26/08/2023,To repeat. Everything very careful and quiet environment
20110,3185987,1,altohe24,20/08/2023,Camping with bad shower facilities that you have to bend over. I'm 1.80 cm tall. Small plots. €40 a night very expensive and irregular plots
20110,3154441,1,madugr,15/08/2023,"Through my journey along the Mediterranean I came across this place. Contrary to the other comments, I unfortunately have to give it a lower rating. It's a small campsite with my campervan I can't extend the awning in width because the pitches are too narrow. The way to the beach leads along the freeway entrance and with a 3 year old child too dangerous, the way to the tunnel is pulled down and up by a huge blackberry hedge, so watch out for the thorns. The beach is dirty is not part of the site but if someone wants to go to the beach there are definitely others this one is not worth visiting. You can't adjust the temperature when showering, it changes from cold to warm and back again. When I took a shower there was so little water that I was allowed to shower against the wall. I paid €56 for 2 adults and 2 children, which is far too expensive for what is offered. I will not come back. Unfortunately I don't like who I like."
20110,3021844,4,inkus,26/07/2023,"Small campsite with all the necessary comfort. Even if the pool is semi-covered in July, deckchairs in the lawn were available. The staff is neither friendly nor rude. You can hear the road a lot but in Marbella, there are few places where you can't hear it. dangerous access"
20110,2997017,4,AryWonderW,21/07/2023,"Small campsite, well equipped, good value for money. A bit noisy due to the motorway but I recommend it!! Clean services, clean swimming pool, super mini market and restaurant! Friendly staff! Convenient taxi service outside the campsite which took us to Estepona, a beautiful city. Possibility of going by bus n79 but to take it is far away. Uncomfortable and dangerous access to the beach!"
20110,2914305,5,WalterT5,02/07/2023,"Places with tropical plants, mostly under trees, beautiful old well-kept vegetation. toilet clean. 2 hidden footpaths 5 minutes to the beach. Good restaurant on site, pool, shop, everything simple and OK, friendly staff. € 29.- with 3 people without electricity (from 2 days). Some street noise. Beach lined with large hotel complexes. We will be back."
20110,2859474,5,escherianonegro,16/06/2023,"Delimited and shady pitches, clean and well cared for. €18.50 2 people and dog with camper per night, with electricity and utilities included, if you leave before 10am, otherwise €30. Quiet night."
20110,2851240,5,CN29,13/06/2023,Very nice little campsite. The staff is very kind. Small supermarket on site and access to the restaurant by the campsite. The sanitary facilities are regularly cleaned and the swimming pool is very good. Sunny or shaded pitches. 25€ per night 2 people with electricity. We recommend
20110,2843019,5,Jimmy6868,11/06/2023,"Large, airy pitches, everything available, modern sanitary facilities. Restaurant and shop not inviting, there is still potential."
20110,2833275,3,kilkenny-fan,08/06/2023,"The beach is easy to reach, but not very suitable for swimming. You have to fight sivh over a few meters of stones before you stand on sand. I can't fault anything about the sanitary facilities. A bit difficult to reach by bike, had to go towards the cars. I think 22€ per night for a tent is steep, but I have to get used to it slowly."
20110,2788343,4,EliderEisbaer,26/05/2023,"Very nicely laid out campsite. Many beautiful plants between the terraces. Showers, toilets and washing machine ok but not outstanding. Unfortunately to hear constant street noise and a bit expensive. Paid €33 per night for 2 people including electricity and campervan. Overall ok and recommended for a stopover."
20110,2729214,3,Kristin11,06/05/2023,We personally didn't like it that much here. Our toilets weren't that clean and a small jet came down the wall from the shower. There was also no possibility to deposit things in the cabin. The air in the hall by the pool was unbearable. Wlan works very well for this if you then asked for the code.
20110,2726920,4,lelecaporal,06/05/2023,"if you are passing through a relaxing day, excellent campsite in the middle of a former nursery with a hot pool in a greenhouse. tried going to the beach a scary tunnel and beach not great. clean toilets nearby there is a restaurant where you ate well"
20110,2710930,4,Pepito7,30/04/2023,pleasant campsite even if there is the motorway nearby in the evening it remains correct in terms of noise. swimming pool and impeccable service. to visit the region it is perfect and Estepona is a magnificent city.
20110,2642367,4,dafnos,05/04/2023,"good facilities, smallish plots, very noisy as next to a main road, shop, loads of cats that seemed to keep taunting my dog, no fear! good on site restaurant but hated the walk to the beach, over rough ground and through a drainage tunnel under the main road, but we did it several times and it didn’t take very long. nice cycle/walk prom to Estapona but parts were closed and had to go on main road"
20110,2596517,3,Michel1248,02/03/2023,"Very nice staff. The place is unfortunately right at an intersection, so it's a bit noisy. The sanitary facilities are good and are cleaned very often. Cycling to Estepona is very easy via a cycle path along the sea. The bus to Marbella is also great."
20110,2573274,4,mjj81,10/02/2023,"Parque Tropical is a nice place. Convenient, clean, well located although you can hear the noise from the highway. Not too expensive at least in January. The lady at the reception is friendly. We stayed there for a week"
20110,2567533,5,FredFlintsone,03/02/2023,Unfortunately the campsite was full & we didn't get a place. The lady at reception was very nice. For €3 per person we were allowed to use the hot shower with good pressure. Sanitary facilities super clean.
20110,2561721,3,Beckydawson,27/01/2023,Nice enough site but very small pitches. beach not as close as you think and having to walk alongside very busy roads
20110,2560749,4,EmJerv,26/01/2023,"Shady leafy campsite, relaxed vibe. Small plots but fine for 6.5 m RV. 5 minute walk to the beach. You have to pass under the road via a tiny tunnel. Showers warm and then cold and then warm again. But fine. Very well stocked shop at reception. Receptionist is super sweet and helpful. Avocados were delicious from their garden. Didn’t use the pool but it looked clean. The facilities are all clean."
20110,2554788,5,TilloconFury,18/01/2023,"Beautiful campsite with lots of banana plants and palm trees. Pitches small but sufficient. The indoor pool is nice and warm (the hall, not the water). The only negative point is that the shower heads hang a bit low. Everything super clean."
20110,2554363,3,HeikeXLI,17/01/2023,"Small plots, narrow paths. Loud on the freeway. A stroll to the beach is not possible. We only stayed one night. The lady at the reception very nice."
20110,2550658,3,Chilham,13/01/2023,"It’s okay, but for this money (€21 with ACSI), it should be so much better. Facilities need a significant overhaul to justify that. Route to beach a disaster. Restaurant is good but overpriced."
20110,2543530,4,silvia71cat,06/01/2023,"The campsite is very well maintained and clean. The girl at the reception and the maintenance guy are very attentive and helpful. the cleaning lady is unwilling to help and shakes the mop without looking if it is splashing someone. Relatively narrow plots. 2 people in Camper with ACSI €21 Washing machine €5 Dryer €5 When paying with ACSI it has been cheap, but in reality camping is expensive."
20110,2541018,3,jd07,04/01/2023,The campsite is nice and pleasant. very friendly reception. I give the evaluation of 3* because it seemed excessively expensive for a 2-person camper that enters at 7 in the afternoon and leaves the next morning (€30.80).
20110,2540383,4,Basoline,03/01/2023,"Spacious pitches on gravel between beautiful plants. Very friendly staff. Discharging gray water a bit inconvenient: when you're done you have to make a tour of the campsite. Environment has not much to offer. We were traveling through so no problem for us. Too bad we couldn't easily go to the beach. Furthermore, certainly a nice small-scale campsite!"
20110,2534533,4,Helton,30/12/2022,"Small, friendly and clean site with all facilities, including an open pool (in winter!). Asci rate is €20 per night. 

Downsides are proximity to a very busy and noisy road and pedestrian access to the wonderful beach via a drainage tunnel under the road, which was flooded when we were there."
20110,2534234,3,PeteNui,30/12/2022,We stayed here for 2 nights and it cost us €48.58 without electric. overall is good enough. found a hard way to get down to the beach. swimming pool weren't heated.
20110,2533529,5,7g7g,30/12/2022,lots of shade but easy to drive around even with 8m. 20e acsi including electric. the supermarket has everything and the staff are very friendly. the walk to the beach is not good but there is a better way if you walk down the road left of the restaurant on the roundabout. about 150m there is a path on your left to the cycle path. cycle to Estepona is great and easy going with good views.
20110,2514816,4,CriviR6,06/12/2022,"Quiet and as the best option due to its proximity to Marbella, in contrast, in this one the spaces are larger for long vehicles. Friendly staff, heated pool that we did not try because we did not wear clothing. Regarding the tunnel towards the beach, well, that is as it is due to its proximity to the highway, it is not a thing of the campsite. Diversity of flora and very complete services. With ACSI €20 and electricity."
20110,2499388,1,corase,18/11/2022,"Chose the spot for hookup on the beach. Tunnel through which you can reach the beach on foot. To reach this tunnel you have to walk behind the crash barriers on both expressways. Doesn't work at all, was honked at by the drivers. Dangerous! I wouldn't do it at home either."
20110,2442183,3,Niki420,14/10/2022,"Beautiful, cozy CP with lots of nature. Unfortunately a bit expensive: VW T5, 2 people electricity for 27.60/night. Check out at 12pm"
20110,2419075,3,Princesse07,02/10/2022,"nice campsite, a little expensive. friendly welcome, the only problem is this one. getting to the beach not very practical and quite dirty route, lots of trash cans and a disgusting tunnel to pass."
20110,2386797,5,mamasueadventures,19/09/2022,Lovely quiet campsite- access to beach a bit awkward if trying to use a bike. If you exit the campsite and head up the hill towards the church with the silver dome turn right at roundabout and down the hill ( Calle Lima) at the bottom is a bike path on your right  - follow that and it takes you directly to the beach and  bike path where it’s an easy 45 min cycle to Estepona .
20110,2240450,4,Noerode,15/08/2022,"Quiet and nice place. The seats are spacious and in our case well leveled. We spent 3 nights, the only downside is that the power socket is quite far from some squares. Clean bathrooms and showers. Small but very nice pool."
20110,2232537,2,lielie,13/08/2022,"Very unpleasant staff. The good thing about it is that they give you the option of spending the night for €16.50, and that it is close to Marbella. To spend one or two nights well. Some very uneven plots."
20110,1940007,3,loscaravaneros,02/06/2022,"The campsite is fine, the area is quiet. What we saw wrong is that the plots are very uneven and narrow and the potty very uncomfortable like a residential toilet where all the waste splashes..."
20110,1846390,2,reisefreak1,22/04/2022,"Were here for 4 days over Easter; our conclusion: access to the sea adventurous through a steep tunnel. Disturbing traffic on the A7. Shower without controlling the temperature. Price rip-off, because and only when checking out was informed that the price without ACSI card is 36 €/2 pers/day (!), with ACSI 20 €. Beautiful: long beach promenade to Estepona and the resto on the CP (private operator)."
20110,1813265,2,ririfred,10/04/2022,"The camping as such is nice. But the location is very unfortunate: next to a highway, which you hear constantly. It’s very hard to reach the beach or restaurants too. You can go there quicker through a tunnel underneath the highway, but it is flooded when it rains. Beach is also often closed off by the many hotels. The camping is also quite expensive, considering it’s low season."
20110,1807754,4,Mosbah,06/04/2022,"A bit costy considering it's low season. With 2 kids we pay around 37€ with electricity for one night, some discount if staying longer.
BUT the place itself is lovely and really gives a tropical feeling! An indoor pool (very quiet, barely no one there) with warm water which we all loved. Facilities seems fine and the area itself is quiet. Heavy traffic can be heard but not noisy."
20110,1788726,1,pczek,20/03/2022,We email to book and they replied no need. I confirmed dates anyway. When we  arrived they asked for our booking. When showed the email they only had a dirty place next to the bonfire. Then we put washing on at the normal 40c cycle. The machine boiled and destroyed our clothes (steam poured out of the top). They claimed nothing was wrong with the machine and put it back in service. Be warned.
20110,1778306,4,mcFlyby,09/03/2022,Nice site. Lovely pitches surrounded with trees. A bit tight but aren’t most. Toilets and showers clean. Heated pool a bit grubby but a distraction on a wet day. Beach a bit of a walk and not the best but two decent bistros on the door step and a stocked shop.
20110,1772288,5,EfratKimhi,03/03/2022,"Great place to stay! Everything clean, showers with hot water. A heated swimming pool!!! Plants and flowers everywhere. We definitely recommend thogh price a bit high for a family of 5, we stayed one week!"
20110,1767036,1,nicobiermann,26/02/2022,"Sloping & narrow places, showers leave a lot to be desired, WiFi doesn't work. theoretically okay..16.50€ if you stay from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 a.m. the following day."
20110,1749316,4,MimmiNiklas,06/02/2022,"I see that people think it’s tight for big cars, it depends on where you park. We are 7,50 and there was absolutely no problem! Very friendly and nice with heating in showers. Unfortunately the heated pool closed at 18.00. Did not try the bar. Went to the beach and paid 10,- for a Gin Tonic!!!!"
20110,1741031,3,eaunaturelle,25/01/2022,"we only used this place to fill up with fresh water and empty the grey tank and toilet. easy to find and a friendly welcome. only suitable for motorhome up to 7m as it is a bit tight. we're 6.5m and it was fine.
we didn't stay but the campsite looked nice."
20110,1734828,4,klausleo,16/01/2022,A very pleasant place
20110,1725971,4,UweRommel,04/01/2022,"Were there on January 3, 2022. Not suitable for big ships. Access to the beach through a narrow tunnel. Heated showers. Gravel subsoil. Small shop on the square with baguette."
20110,1723051,3,isabellaoh,02/01/2022,We came here just to shower (3€ per person) and dump and refill (6€). Showers went back and forth from being very hot or cold as there’s no knob to change the temperature. A little pricy for just dumping and water and inconvenient for WC dump as you have to walk around a big building. Receptionist was nice and spoke English fine. Wouldn’t stay here as the plots were very small and crammed.
20110,1712869,4,maloox89,19/12/2021,"Really feels like being in a tropical park but also near the motorway in any case we slept pretty well!
Nice atmosphere and sanitary block was clean.
Indoor swimming pool is small but full of plants!"
20110,1709812,4,shimon42,14/12/2021,"We have stayed here twice in the past couple of weeks.  The cost is good for excellent facilities (€20 with ACSI card), the pitches are quite small and we had to be selective with our 7.5m van.  We found a great spot (106) with plenty of room.  The site is situated right next to the main road so road noise is a factor, however, not prohibitive in my view.  Very friendly staff."
20110,1708790,3,WillyenKatten,12/12/2021,"came here for service today. costs €6. Discharging dirty water is just as well aiming for the well, but with the cassette I had to walk around a building, which in my eyes was not clearly indicated."
20110,1707756,4,George1207,10/12/2021,"friendly set up, big enough pitches for 20 euro/night.
Used the pool which was nice and good facilities.
Bit tricky along road to get to the beach but good dog walks nearby up the hill. We would stay again."
20110,1702814,4,Louis_OH,04/12/2021,"Very cozy campsite: sufficiently large pitches, many nicely planted with banana trees, gravel, very clean showers, mini-market, hardly any noise from the nearby motorway, campsite barrier closed from midnight, one night € 21.60 (van / 1 p .), two nights ff. then € 19.20, each including electricity."
20110,1684039,4,djolecc,10/11/2021,"Super small campsite, well-maintained vegetation not a branch does not interfere with children and adults alike there is always a place only downside the noise of the road at weekends and rush hours the rest is quiet .. indoor and heated swimming pool is a more."
20110,1681758,4,mifaldita,07/11/2021,"Shaded pitches, shop to buy, without any problem !!"
20110,1668174,2,calimeric,29/10/2021,"Indeed the place is pleasant, but the pitches are very narrow, the WiFi does not work at the back of the park, and especially expensive paid for an arrival at 5.30 p.m. and compulsory departure before noon, at the end of October"
20110,1663159,4,Sarlauma,26/10/2021,"It is a really nicely laid out campsite, with the Acsicard 20 € for 2 people + camper we find a bit too much."
20110,1646246,4,Tuprisporelmundo,15/10/2021,"No problem on our part. The name does it justice. The toilets and showers were clean. The only downside is that the power outlet is far in some pitches, we had to ask other campers for a 30-meter extension cord, because with ours of 10 meters it did not arrive (and the one they loaned us at reception did not arrive either)"
20110,1617565,5,Bea77,29/09/2021,"The campsite is aptly named because it feels like the tropics with this magnificent vegetation. We were lucky enough to be able to choose our location and stayed 1 more day, so we felt so good. Reasonable price with the comfort of the equipment provided, it was really great! Just a small drawback for the showers which remain a bit narrow for our taste."
20110,1604158,4,jaanaposedi,24/09/2021,"Nice and clear place with a lot of green. Plots surrounded with banana trees and palm trees, we liked it, looked a bit like in the rainforest. Sanitary facilities clean. Staff friendly. We felt very comfortable"
20110,1475972,5,txeroni,18/08/2021,We have spent two very comfortable nights. The reception staff are very friendly and the plot is very shady. The pool is very good and bathrooms and showers acceptable. 2 adults / AC / electricity € 34.60 / night. 5 min walk from the beach. We will be back!!
20110,1464777,4,pequesport,16/08/2021,"My assessment is only for one night, the girl who attended me at the reception very nice, has a small shop and a restaurant with variety. The plot with a lot of shade. They insist a lot on entering the Covid protocol, they even send you a pdf with it and then nobody pays attention, not even the cleaning lady who enters and leaves the bathrooms with the mask on her chin ..."
20110,1429475,3,vax69,09/08/2021,Quiet campsite with indoor swimming pool. Uncomfortable to get to the beach. The only possibility of stopping in the area.
20110,1410744,3,elgriegonet,05/08/2021,I came here just to fill water and dump grey and black water. Polite stuff. Only one tumb to fill water and to use for the black water too. Total cost 6€
20110,1389699,1,loslolos1103,01/08/2021,"A fairly neglected place overall, the facilities very basic, particularly the showers. Hot water comes out late, bad and never. Quite dirty and far from everything. The beach 10 minutes away on an impassable and dangerous road. The staff, dry and cutting."
20110,1386760,5,RICESTER,31/07/2021,"Very nice park, excellent semi indoor pool - super nice. Mini market with good prices. Great restaurant and bar space, but with hotel prices. 10 min from the beach. Camping with very affordable prices in high season."
20110,1299743,3,Roelenpleun,05/07/2021,"Neat campsite, beautifully laid out with beautiful plants. Places are fine, not super big. There is a short cut to the beach but it is not very child friendly. The pool is nice, under the corrugated iron it can feel a bit stuffy. Staff are friendly and speak good English. Plumbing is not super clean. The road causes a lot of noise nuisance."

20110,1239456,5,Jdramalho89,06/06/2021,"Excellent park. We ended up staying two nights because it's really good. Caravan places always in the shade, the surroundings really remind you of a tropical place. very clean bathrooms. Super friendly and helpful staff. They provide a number through which we can speak to the reception via WhatsApp. Free and good wifi. I think I can say it's the best camping in the area."
20110,1191733,5,noeliaypuntos,10/05/2021,"Magnificent experience. We loved the heated pool, as well as the vegetation and how well-kept the facilities were. Very close to the theme park, so I recommend it for families with children."
20110,1177887,4,Frankieee,23/04/2021,"Due to covid there was only cca 5 plots actively used (rest was either free or long term occupied). Pool was great (hardly used by anybody else). Wifi excellent (on middle row plots, bottom row is much worse). 
2 nights for 2 adults and electricity = €45
Place for discharging gray water not ideal, as well as black water. But manageable. 
Overall nice experience, thanks"
20110,1153975,3,vitvalka,19/03/2021,"We liked the pool with warm water a lot. But this year in feb/march it was much colder than previous years. Also the price with two kids is around 25-30€ a night depending on the lenght of stay, in winter. Good hideout on rainy days, but a little far away from beach, shops and towns."
20110,1136422,5,Charlotteopreis,10/02/2021,"Beautiful place. very friendly people, very helpful. nice little shop with the most important things in it! 5 min. Walk via shortcut to the boulevard and the beach. recommended this campsite."

Children can move around freely. In the pool only with adults. Connection to Marbella by bike terrible. Almost only on the motorway. After Estepona great on the promenade. A7 audible, doesn't bother us."
20110,1123921,5,Michaga84,26/12/2020,"A clean camping site with lots of vegetation. We stayed here for 2 days, the kids are happy because there is an indoor pool. About 8 minutes walk to the amphibian, free wi fi. Nice atmosphere"

The heated pool area acceptable but improvable. What they should improve is the emptying area for motorhomes. Near the beach with a nice and long walk.
20110,740777,3,yvelise,09/11/2019,Noisy campsite on the edge of the national. To disadvised to the big jigs. With our 7.40 m parking was not easy because very narrow traffic lanes as the locations. Too bad because beautiful beach nearby

The positive aspect is the proximity to the pedestrian path to see the mills. To do at sunset. The negative aspect is the fact that at night young people gather in the picnic area and sing at the top of their lungs until 4 in the morning. I recommend positioning yourself as you enter the picnic area on the right

To sleep it seems to be very good, quite level."
20113,2512073,5,LecomteKristof,03/12/2022,"Super location and had a very quiet night. You can drive up with your mobile home, but there are only a few parking spaces. Possibly to consider in low season. Several restaurants within walking distance."

However, I don't recommend this car park to spend the night there - some guys lingered chatting and laughing until 3am right between the sleeping campers despite much more space at their disposal. In addition, there is a large continuous passage of cars, you can see that it is a meeting place for young people. We haven't rested at all. We will never go back."

It is more spectacular to sleep upstairs, next to the mills, but we have found the road cut off, having a concert, so we have stayed here. Quiet and you can walk up to see the mills. There is a picnic area next door. As it was windy, it was empty, but it can be a noisy place if there are people using it."

Sloping near the edges so people tend to park only in the centre area. There is a lot of dirty rubbish around. Good for visiting the windmills and castle and quiet overnight but nothing else to recommend it in my opinion.

Even as the site is very large if you get away from these tables you can hear almost nothing. It's quite dirty"

All that are little points but combined together they make you sleep not too well.

Big gravelled area, partially flat, partially some declination. Picknick- tables and garbage- bins around. Easy walk to the castle and the mills, nice view. If you park close to the mountain, you have shade in the morning till 10h00. Overall an okay- place, but far from ideal."

20142,2320044,5,cuevi,30/08/2022,"Perfect and free, with all the services. To put a downside, we missed a container, there was only one glass. Great views of the castle and next to a very nice town with a very good bakery. Perfect soil, we arrived pouring rain and not a single puddle, not even mud."
20142,2319449,5,xevifar,29/08/2022,area with all services. very cool view of the castle
20142,2248596,5,carmentege,16/08/2022,We stayed one night and very well. Next to the historic center where there are bars and places to hang out and have dinner. Very good views. The castle is also next door (by car it is a moment. Recommended visit). Water and vacuum. Places marked and everything very well indicated. To put one but the light from streetlights a little powerful. Thank you Cardona council for this initiative!
20142,2102030,4,MrAlexl7,21/07/2022,"Great place for parking.  Easy access to the castle and the city (there is even an elevator).  But the gsm signal is weak and they can play football and drive cars until late.

All services (drink water, blavk-grey-water) were gratuit."
20142,1978387,1,rafaydana,15/06/2022,"The score is due to the unspeakable and uncivil driver who spent yesterday afternoon and night driving a dark-colored Toyota car driving at high speed through the parking lot, kicking up a large amount of dust. There are no containers for trash and recycling. Thanks to the municipality, which by the way is beautiful."
20142,1950614,5,sitri,05/06/2022,good area with good services. thank you cardona
20142,1935009,4,camperke_,31/05/2022,"Nice place, had a quiet night here.

Would be 5 stars with a litte less street lights, it doesn't get dark."
20142,1930970,5,JORDI2EURA,30/05/2022,"Improved area in recent years, with separation between vehicles and containers. It is very good and can be alternated with the other of the Corominas, in the same municipality."
20142,1928280,3,Paquimaat,29/05/2022,Free services. The water comes out pretty fast and a lot of it. The only negative is that there are no containers and that the pitches are very short. Our AC of 7.10 did not fit.
20142,1859833,3,Rabbit666,29/04/2022,"Free parking space at the sports center, some of which is also a car parking space. So much hustle and bustle! V/E works, garbage container available, but no seating area. A climb to the Castell is worthwhile and the municipality offers various circular hiking trails."
20142,1827767,5,ivoderooij,16/04/2022,we parked here to visit the city and the castle. parking was a bit tight due to all the Spanish cars ignoring the camper spots. the city and the burgt are well worth a visit.
20142,1820938,5,scalp007,14/04/2022,Thank you to the municipality for this perfectly functional area.
20142,1812696,4,LosViajesDeSnaky,09/04/2022,"We have had a very quiet night. The place is good and with good views. We have not used the services, so we do not comment. To put a catch, too much light in the streetlights. Thanks to the Cardona City Council for this space and for thinking of our group."
20142,1811812,5,Juaniky,09/04/2022,"Thanks to the people of Cardona for having this free place with all the services. Although there are some caravanists who leave garbage, cigarettes and objects on the ground. They should be cleaner, we would have more places in other towns"
20142,1778107,5,filang10,09/03/2022,Perfect place to spend the night with the camper and to visit Cardona! Recommended!
20142,1777358,5,MarjoleinVanDriessche,08/03/2022,"Nice location, view of the castle and the mountains! very centrally located, near the salt mines (recommended, definitely visit when you are here!), the castle and the town. The facilities for discharge and filling are fine. Thank you very much, Municipality of Cardona!"
20142,1774737,4,Robohouse,05/03/2022,"Two very quiet nights, the lighting is already installed and for my taste perhaps too powerful."
20142,1768562,4,Carlosvictor,28/02/2022,"nice place, tables and chairs without showing an example of what not to do, embarrassing."
20142,1761532,4,Miqu3l,20/02/2022,"Good place to park, flat and quiet if it weren't for the fact that we coincided with the Carnival and in the village we spent the night partying, we could hear music but from afar and we were able to sleep. Depending on how you park, you have a discreet space where you can assemble a table and chairs without being seen too much."
20142,1740547,4,vkat,24/01/2022,"It is currently being built, so the seats directly on the sports field are occupied with building materials. During the day there is construction noise and a lot of dust from trucks using the parking lot to unload and turn. But quiet and relaxed in the evening."
20142,1732423,4,Brunnenkuh,12/01/2022,"Very nice location from the square. Very quiet at night. There were only 2 RVs here. Free water works like the disposal. The outside area of the Castell is accessible free of charge, very large."
20142,1730262,5,ieiashs,08/01/2022,"Fantastic area. Next to the football field: quite crowded during the day, but quiet at night. We didn’t need to use heights to level the AC. Drainage and filling service. Ideal for visiting both the salt mines and the castle, I recommend theatrical tours if you go with children."
20142,1709507,1,LAAUTOVIAJERA,13/12/2021,"Good as for the review I have to say that it is not positive, to park there is not a single place reserved for motorhomes, which I do not understand, having a discharge area next to it. The more or less correct discharge area, except for the clean water loading area, a 3/4 or 1/2 thread would be better as it complicates the loading of water a lot, the rest more than correct. Second, youth is not the future"
20142,1705257,2,JotaCePe,07/12/2021,"A shabby and uneven field, full of rubble, with the church carillon playing every quarter of an hour. Only the water change point is worth it."
20142,1704228,2,ruta1,06/12/2021,"Okay, near the center."
20142,1697252,3,OscarReina,24/11/2021,First we were in the Castle parking lot but there was a lot of unevenness in some areas. Finally we spent the night in the area next to the soccer quota. Gray water and toilet service. Filled with water. Very central.
20142,1695391,5,DOMJC,22/11/2021,"A fully equipped and free area, at the foot of the castle, a stone's throw from the medieval city, a breathtaking view of the valley ... everything to satisfy motorhome operators! thank you to the town!"
20142,1689502,4,Remolin,14/11/2021,"Good area, quiet night. It is a bit complicated that it is shared with cars, because on match day it is very crowded. Near the center and the mines"
20142,1681350,5,Furgolon,07/11/2021,"Perfect area to spend the weekend in Cardona and visit the castle and the salt mines. The area is a parking lot that is shared with cars during the day, quiet at night, and on the other side of the soccer field there are not so many cars. we have made use of the gray and black casting. all very well and the town, castle and beautiful mines."
20142,1674442,2,A.xavi,02/11/2021,"I did not like anything! Shared area with cars, (soccer field parking) Saturday night some other meeting of kids and the filling tap is very impractical, to fill 100 liters you spend 300, the city council should change the water connection for a quick connection one. Ea a parking lot to spend the day."
20142,1673092,4,os954,01/11/2021,"Parking with filling station, emptying and chemical toilet. Thanks to the city council !!!! The charming village and must see the castle and the salt mines."

20142,1658985,2,satv13,23/10/2021,"First of all Thanks to the City Council for the initiative. But this Saturday we tried to go three times and it was impossible because of the number of cars parked, even above the gray water dump. So we went to the Castle and couldn't stay."
20142,1623631,3,Danu,03/10/2021,"Good place to park and visit the castle. Unfortunately around 01:00 at night there were young people making a bottle and we couldn't sleep because of their screaming. There is also a lot of light. We recommend parking BEHIND the stadium, there is a sign that indicates that it is also a parking lot and it is a little flatter. The cars were parked in front of the toilets but at 10:00 there was no one parked there."
20142,1602271,3,iseult,23/09/2021,Very good for visiting the city and sleeping in peace. You need good legs to go to the castle but the view is magnificent

20142,1549578,4,Abril20,05/09/2021,"Ground parking with all services except light. There is a lot of space but it is shared with cars. Poorly signposted access; is the parking lot of the football field. 5 minutes from the center, if you walk a little we left the AC in the parking lot and walked to the castle (1.5km approx) and the salt mine (700m). The church and the old town very beautiful. Thank you town hall for thinking of us; we will be back!"
20142,1537831,5,Afbs,01/09/2021,There are plenty of places and it has all the services. For all types of motorhomes
20142,1495703,3,B564,22/08/2021,Good place to stop and change the waters and refuel. I did not like the access very much but it is not impossible to get there.
20142,1410728,4,toijarta,05/08/2021,"Many thanks to the author for this magnificent area so that we can spend the night and empty waters, next to the town and with fantastic views of the castle. Just one problem: some cars park occupying part of the space for emptying gray and black water. It is not understood because there is a lot of free space. Perhaps the city council could mark that small space so that they will not span right there."
20142,1397781,5,EstherQDI,03/08/2021,"Very quiet place (Monday night), with some shade, water and toilet discharge. Impressive views of the castle and the salt mines. Very well organized town. I would go back without hesitation twice. Gràcies Ajuntament de Cardona."

On Saturday night, a bottle of young people just behind the area. It is not at all quiet being next to the sports area. Near the center and the castle to visit."
20142,1249061,3,LaLola_en_ruta,11/06/2021,"Thanks to the city council. As an improvement, the space for AC should be determined since it is shared with cars. Emptying area difficult for parked vehicles to enter. It is not a quiet place due to sports activities. Good for a night of transit and visiting the city, it is worth it."
20142,1225782,5,JosePili06,30/05/2021,"Thanks to the city council for the initiative. Motorhome area with free emptying and filling of water, very quiet night, beautiful views of the castle and a few minutes from the center with all services, we recommend the Monserrat pastry shop."
20142,1211847,5,thorretje,22/05/2021,"Great tidy amenities fine, and I didn't see a ball coming into the parking lot, but there are people fussing about everything, if there's a football field there (could) a ball disappear over it, I'll be back here for sure, great place with beautiful views, municipality board THANK YOU !!"
20142,1210702,4,dima_rv,22/05/2021,"We liked the site. We fill and empty. Views of the castle. We saw football comments, we thought we wouldn't care. In fact, football does not bother but what has happened is that many balls were thrown out of the field and strongly hit the motorhomes and cars parked there. We saw later that you can park upstairs in the castle."
20142,1205535,4,gepetto66,18/05/2021,"People at the end of the afternoon and sportsmen who train. Thank you to the municipality for its space, except on match days. Otherwise a beautiful view of the castle and the salt mountain. Saturday and Sunday, and museum and church closed."

20142,1184217,2,noiammp,03/05/2021,"We have spent two nights in the parking lot, since it cannot be called an area. We could not unload or load since some cars occupied the site. There are no places stipulated for motorhomes, and it fills up with cars every day making access difficult. perfect place but unfortunately it is the opposite."
20142,1183568,2,martajat,02/05/2021,"Pass site to load and unload, park and see the town. Car park shared with motorhomes. Thanks to the city council for the site but it is not an exclusive area for cars. Cars parked occupying part of the unloading area. He would not spend the night."
20142,1169462,5,oriolrue,06/04/2021,"Very cool area, but it is used by cars as parking. if you arrive and it is full, between the soccer field and the ravine there is a little path that leads to another large area where you can park. The town is beautiful and the mines and castle are worth a visit."
20142,1167209,4,SCR.OFICINA,04/04/2021,"Spacious and quiet area, with gray and black water discharge, drinking water and picnic tables. Watch the days they play football as they will last the day the parking lot is full."

20142,1145112,4,jtmontagut,01/03/2021,"Perfect for overnight. Area located between the salt mines and the castle. Water loading and unloading services for gray and black water. Unpaved area. I guess they are still just doing it as there are no limited places. Car-shared parking, which must be implemented when there is football."

20142,884715,3,danoe,20/07/2020,"Spacious and quiet place to sleep. We were 4 vehicles. Beautiful views of the Castle. It could be more tidy, as there are remains of construction materials. It’s right in front of the football field, I guess when there’s a game, in the morning there must be movement."
20142,881544,1,JRM64,19/07/2020,Very desolate area. Full of parked cars. With junk and furniture abandoned in the middle of the open field. It does not invite anything to stay for the night. We only stopped to eat in Cardona. I think that the City Council should be more concerned if it wants to attract the public that we move in AC. Not advisable.
20142,874636,3,BigFamilyBCN,17/07/2020,"Very quiet place and quite level. Very close to the Salt Mines. There is no light option, nor shops where to buy bread. Very beautiful views of the castle"

20142,752143,4,DuarteMML,09/12/2019,"We have been on the bridge on December 6, 2019. Quiet clean place, water and all services already work. Perfect place to park since it is 10 minutes walking from the Castle and another 10 or 15 of the mines, it was great for us since it is in the middle of the two sites and the center of town 5 minutes away."
20142,750052,4,Didiruca06,05/12/2019,"Very quiet night, the bells are ringing pro relax. Ideally located for visiting the town of Cardona or the salt mines. Good views of the impressive castle. The emptying area would change it to avoid those characters who do not respect anything."
20142,746895,2,Papagomas,25/11/2019,On Saturdays and Sundays with football matches the cars invade the water and emptying area. We found it impossible to access the services. If you make the highly recommended visit to the Salt Mines you can park on the premises during opening hours.

Very friendly and efficient staff."

Better take a taxi if you don't want to wait..."

Unfortunately, every place is very uneven, so it is not possible without wedges. Also the traffic from the main road (80km/h) is really loud and can be heard all the time (at night). I find the 21€ (ACSI) too expensive for that."

20190,2629436,2,momoHenri,29/03/2023,Pleasant welcome but for the rest a real disaster! Right next to the freeway so extremely busy. The beach is tiny because the houses are built on it. The showers are for some only with cold water and the others difficult to regulate. The paths are dangerous because they have holes and significant slopes. Hellish!

You can hear the street, but it didn't bother us. You have it almost everywhere. The sea can be louder. 2 people + 1 dog with ACSI €21. But everything included. What good is a place for 15,-€ where I have to pay extra for electricity and shower. Will end up being more expensive. Everything OK"

Facilities here are really really good. Hot clean showers. Washing facilities and the washing machine was just €3.5 and to dry €2 which was excellent and included the powder. Didn’t use the restaurant as it was closed both times we have stayed. Would come back

Nice pool area, very clean showers and toilets, and a good supermarket nearby. A drawback is the emptying site for grey water: hard to access and unhygienic. If you decide to fill fresh water there, use your own hose as the floor is also an emptying site for toilets but with no separate hose."

It is true that it is a little inclined but it is not so much, the worst of the site is the amount of flies and bugs given that there are animals (sheep and cows) nearby and the noise of their cowbells all night. In the bar they don't give hot breakfasts until 10:30, at least in September but you can use outside tables with your own food."

20423,2302959,4,amilpin080,26/08/2022,"Perfect for visiting the town and doing adventure activities. I recommend the Duendes via Ferrata with children (and Sorrosal for adults, which is next door). If you have some experience, rent the equipment at ""Pyrenean adventures"" (€15) . The one for children is easy if you have experience in adventure parks in trees. The one for adults is easy but it is long, with great heights. Spectacular!"

Who are the disrespectful?"

We spend the morning to go to Casa Joaquín, which has spectacular food, but you have to make a reservation 2 days before. There are only 4 or 5 places for large motorhomes, the Campers without problem there are more places."

I will not come back."

It is the one that is to the entrance of the population, with an entrance next to the town with a curve too closed, to enter better by the furthest one. Here there are many vehicles parked overnight. If your motorhome is one more vehicle, there are no problems; but if you expand you are thrown out."

No water or eletricity available.
Close to a national road, with cars passing all night, but to be honest didn't heard much during the night.
You can find plenty of parking with shade.
Only con is that there was no one else around, so we felt a bit less safe."

As soon as we arrived, he came to talk to us, and in the morning he was waiting for us to charge the two euros for the football raffle, and he didn't tell us that it was a voluntary payment. It was a bit rude. Good and beautiful beach, with extensive sand. Further on, in the non-licensed area, it is possible to take the dogs"

20450,3017567,5,requingris,25/07/2023,"6 real camper places, but located in the heart of the city center near a swimming pool and toilets 200 m below in an open leisure center. The rest is a large car park where you will find water and garbage. The ground is paved, a little tilted but with a correction of wedges it is sufficient. Many places in the shade."
20450,2959752,4,zerodfault,13/07/2023,Very hard to park here. Cons: My motorhome is around 7.5meters and I couldn’t park it. Either wouldn’t fit lengthwise or it would hit the low trees.|| Pros: has a lot of spaces. Clean and apparently calm.
20450,2939317,4,greglaurent62@gmail.com,08/07/2023,Thank you to the municipality for providing free emptying and filling services. Attention access is a bit complicated especially for large jigs.

20450,2817392,5,hossanova,03/06/2023,"Absolutely great parking space, right next to a city park that includes indoor and outdoor pools (the latter only opens in mid-June) as well as free (!) clean toilets and hot (!) showers (just walk downhill past the indoor pool, about 5 minutes away, opposite the fairground). Fresh water was on 1.6. accessible. Better than a lot of CP! Thank you to the community for making this possible!"
20450,2794335,4,SolarJoe,28/05/2023,"We stood still and felt safe. Perfect for transit, but we wouldn't want to stay here any longer. Disposal goes, but fresh water is turned off"
20450,2792082,2,Caradinho,27/05/2023,"It would be a good area, if only it wasn't downhill! We were not able to level the camper properly even with chocks"
20450,2791611,4,igorgama,27/05/2023,"Possible to waste your waters, but unfortunately fresh water isn’t working."
20450,2790982,4,Chianki,27/05/2023,"Flat place, possibility to empty the gray water and the toilet cassette, fill the water tank and spend the night there. Quiet and free place"

20450,2717493,4,HPM1961,02/05/2023,"So….we liked it here. It's a bit crooked...you need wedges, we straightened with a rock and slept well. The V/E works, okay... dirty water drains badly, but the rest works fine. Thank you to the community. A nice little place"

20450,2643269,4,palomita,06/04/2023,Super quiet but without services. shims are needed
20450,2603745,3,Guus70,09/03/2023,The terrain is indeed very skewed and even for the straightest places you need big wedges. Therefore only 3 stars. The night was quiet. If only every village had a place with facilities. Thanks to the community!
20450,2565036,3,RossiSimona,31/01/2023,Poorly maintained area. To date the gray drain is clogged and everything pours into the lawn. Sloped parking but in the shade so good for summer.
20450,2564012,2,MissLily,30/01/2023,"Small places, everything sloping. Took water but that water tasted really bad. 
Woke in the morning from a choir of dows, roosters AND vild cats so needed to go early."
20450,2561574,1,Marlouk,27/01/2023,There is a lack of parking space here. The arrival and exit a bit difficult! Otherwise okay for an overnight stay!
20450,2560465,3,FUB,25/01/2023,"The parking spaces are in the last corner, as well as the VE, of a car parking lot. The pitches are too short for mobile homes and you have to look for a spot where you fit. But they are ok for vans. The VE would be ok if the gray water drain was not clogged. That's how it goes down the hill. That seems to have been the case for a long time. Otherwise quiet area to sleep."
20450,2559599,5,PuderVan,24/01/2023,"this place is FREE. You can and may spend the night here, and there is also a fresh and gray water point. Yes, some of the seats are a bit crooked. Nevertheless, it is interesting what some people expect from a free place including a warm shower and toilet 3 minutes away."
20450,2559515,3,muremy,24/01/2023,"strange, this place does not appear on my park4N, unless I put it in my favorites! it was when I wanted to indicate that it appeared! very sloping and narrow for 7m40, but doable to go there! trees . drain/water. it looks quiet"

20450,2512828,3,Sammy.jun,04/12/2022,"It's actually just a parking lot for ""cars"" with a supply and disposal option and this is in the corner. A little quicky. I, with my 6.5m+ bikes, would have to think carefully about where I would stand for the night. Otherwise it was a quiet night. Oh, despite the ramps a bit sloping"
20450,2507154,3,justineetsam,27/11/2022,"Space not great in general, we did not dare to take water there because not super clean good to empty your tank"

20450,2288977,4,terminal15,23/08/2022,"Perfect location for an overnight stay, but as mentioned you will definitely need chocks as it is sloping. Small outdoor swimming pool with showers nearby. Very popular spot, can be difficult to manoeuvre when it fills up."

20450,2122006,4,GeoDalmis,25/07/2022,"Spent two quiet nights here. However, the space is sloping in both directions - can only be compensated to some extent with wedges. Parking a little further down at the free, very nice outdoor pool is more suitable. It is also not a mobile home parking space, but a normal parking lot with supply and disposal options for mobile homes. Exit for >6m very difficult and narrow"
20450,2047713,5,Zakaman,07/07/2022,Good free pitch with lots of shade. Fill up with water and dispose of it. Free swimming pool right next door - unfortunately there seems to be a limit on people and we couldn't get in anymore. Maybe better in the morning.

20450,1883157,5,marthaconso,11/05/2022,"Quiet sloped but we didn’t mind. Free swimming pool was closed at this time but I can imagine it would be great during summer. We walked to try find the pool (10 minutes away) and some workers said we could take showers for free, which were lovely with unlimited hot water. They told us we could park our van outside but we had to leave unfortunately. Would recommend even just for the showers."
20450,1846691,5,SurfNoob99,22/04/2022,Great parking lot. There is a very nice plant shop towards the swimming pool and further towards the fields there are even free toilets.

20459,2867301,3,ccomsa,18/06/2023,"The most expensive campsite during my road trip Spain Portugal (Douro Valley), the swimming pool does not work, it is the factory, noisy and full restaurant on Sunday 19 euro for a normal car and a person without electricity. No choice it is the only one in Burgos"
20459,2866401,3,wakoe,18/06/2023,"1 Person with van no electricity 19€
washing 3,5€ drying 3,5€
During my stay wifi was only working properly near the reception. 
for a warm shower I had to go to the next wash house..."
20459,2824098,4,MarionWallace,05/06/2023,"This campsite is fine for a night or two The facilities were a bit old but perfectly clean, and the office staff were friendly and spoke English. There's some minor noise from a factory across the river but we didn't find it too intrusive. 
We couldn't get a bus back from town on a Thursday evening but a taxi cost less than 7 Euros. NB there's a monastery v close by that's well worth a visit."
20459,2822696,3,LuilliVan,05/06/2023,I was in May and quality price was good. You have a bus that takes you to the center of Burgos. clean toilets
20459,2813112,3,Mino4255,02/06/2023,Sanitary certainly old but clean. 23€ with the Acsi card when it is announced 17€?
20459,2782848,5,Bamboujos,24/05/2023,"Very good, spacious pitch, admittedly the sanitary facilities are a little dated but clean and I've seen much worse...some people complain about nothing, frankly it's a very pleasant campsite with a very decent restaurant"
20459,2780191,1,Haegar128cgn,23/05/2023,We're on the pitch today and we're disgusted. Nobody here is interested in maintaining or keeping things clean. I've rarely seen such scruffy sanitary facilities. I totally agree with Redvan.
20459,2775604,1,Redvan1,22/05/2023,"Worst place we've seen. Toilets and showers are very old and dirty. Childrens playground is falling apart.They charge nearly 40 euros (7 for electricity only!) and don't do any maintenance. Shame on them! Also, the pool was green and closed. There's no privacy at all. people are packed together. We asked our money back and left, 20 min east there's a great campsite. very green, clean, affordable"
20459,2739614,2,sarriette73,10/05/2023,"Bad, expensive noisy and average promiscuity. Not too many choices in Burgos… imposed location"
20459,2727515,4,iobee,06/05/2023,"Clean, without any charm. The pitches are not reserved, we settle where there is space."
20459,2720266,3,kanijamadrid,03/05/2023,"Note that motorhome services are very accessible. The toilets, sinks, etc... very clean although quite old. We only spent one night but it seems to have a lot of life. Especially the bar - restaurant at the entrance. It is well located to visit the city or even make a stop, rest and get the motorhome ready to continue on your way."
20459,2694348,2,didierBuron,24/04/2023,campsite very well placed to access the city. The campsite is already full at this time and not all the sanitary facilities are open. however the price remains high: 32€ for a van and 2 elect adults
20459,2672299,5,BiancaVanlife2022,15/04/2023,The man at the reception speaks Dutch. So nice if you run into bad luck and someone can help you translate. The restaurant at the campsite is superb. The paella delicious and the wine for a Spanish price. By bike 15 minutes to the center or 50 minutes walk through a park. Plumbing is outdated and most campers come there for a stopover. Quiet area definitely worth it
20459,2628929,5,cyladel,29/03/2023,"Very good, spacious pitch, sanitary facilities could use a little more heating. Public transport near the campsite. After visiting the cathedral, a nice and typical restaurant to recommend at PONCHO Calle san Lorenzo 15y24. Excellent tapas and dishes and a warm welcome."
20459,2602436,3,martyboy,08/03/2023,"Nice site for a stopover and a day in Burgos. Cathedral worth a visit. Only downside is near bye church likes to ring its bells at 12am,12:15 am and from between 6am and 8am which was annoying."
20459,2596851,4,Alanister0314,03/03/2023,"We stopped for one night while visiting a nearby (great) mechanic. Large showers were nice and hot, my children appreciated they could be hand held. Very tired facilities though, hard to tell how clean they were. Playground very tired too, but fine for one night. €3.50 each for washer/dryer, €26 for 2 adults 2 children (they only charged for one child though)."
20459,2596510,5,Michel1248,02/03/2023,Large campsite with everything you need. Free choice of pitch. Very nice staff. The city can be reached perfectly by bike and is super beautiful.
20459,2565982,3,WeegieWilly,01/02/2023,"All units were parked on the road, though pitches didn’t appear waterlogged.
Old metal door to enter facilities, which felt like a prison. Inside-warm-very welcome given zero degrees outside. Showers large, water hot.
Cleanliness seemed ok-difficult to tell as facilities are so tired.
3k walk into town on paths along the river, UNESCO cathedral worth a visit.
Conclusion-fine for 1 night stopover."
20459,2560645,4,LucaRonzoni,26/01/2023,"Very convenient campsite for visiting the city. Immediately outside the campsite there is a pedestrian road from which you can easily reach the center following the course of the river. Functional bathrooms, very hot showers. Restaurant and shop at the entrance"

The place is still well frequented, but you can also find a little more spacious places. Overall very quiet, you can hear the street in the distance very faintly. Overall a good place for a stopover."

20459,2276269,3,Urtega,20/08/2022,"Very old facilities, they would need more maintenance and some small reform. The store is very neglected. Perfect for visiting Burgos by bike. We have been good there"

20459,2133066,4,agcmoa,27/07/2022,"very large campsite, too expensive for a municipal campsite: €31 for 2 adults in a motorhome. There are no hedges separating the pitches, so the placement is quickly chaotic. Some electrical terminals are hs. The toilets are cleaned several times a day. bus stop in front of the campsite to go to Burgos in 15 min (June to September) Cycle tracks along the river."
20459,2120407,5,bp85,25/07/2022,"Very good campsite, at the reception a man who speaks French, quiet place and large pitches and lots of shade. 5 clean toilet blocks, toilet paper provided, hot showers with variable temperature and shower head.

20459,1870714,3,Leslobs3,05/05/2022,"Very pleasant welcome. Beautiful green spaces outside for walking or cycling. Convenient for visiting Burgos. Very clean toilets. The campsite deserves a renovation of these pitches because the ground is wet, grassy and muddy... A renovation of the service area would not be a luxury. On the other hand, the washing and drying machines are efficient."
20459,1866884,4,FlakeDVK,02/05/2022,"Nice place with good shade and better bar. Right next to the beautiful Miraflores charterhouse and 4km walk from the center of Burgos. Pleasant walk following the river without risk of loss. Low frequency of buses to Plaza de España. Very friendly staff. Municipal camping, austere but correct. If the rates were adjusted a little in low season it would be perfect."

20459,1832476,2,arno252,17/04/2022,"We paid €39 for one night for a motorhome, two adults, two children. Nice campsite, professional staff, clean but a little dilapidated sanitary facilities, swimming pool transformed into a pond for ducks.

20459,1627061,4,Aupatolosa,04/10/2021,It is the second time we go to this campsite. Very well parceled out for AC and with many electrical outlets. Very quiet and with very decent shower services. Very clean. A cafeteria with sandwiches and menus. At the entrance of the campsite for a bus that takes you to the center (the schedule is provided at the reception). The only thing against it is the amount of flies there are.

20459,1521037,2,FraGhi,27/08/2021,"Very unfavorable value for money. Sanitary to renovate urgently. Swimming pool that looks like a footbath. Correct location, perfect welcome. The asking price 35 € for one night, 3 people, 7.50m with electricity must allow the work to be paid. It is not up to a municipal campsite in a city like Burgos"
20459,1496579,4,LluisSala,22/08/2021,"Municipal campsite with many places, with all services. It has a good pool. Toilets and showers are simple. To visit Burgos we parked in the castle car park, and then we went to the campsite, where there was no problem with places and you can enter until late."
20459,1476759,3,randrea2,18/08/2021,"Practical campsite because 10 minutes from the city center and served by a bus. We spent one night there, not too many people, clean toilets and the possibility of recharging with water etc. Count 30 € per night for two in a van with electricity. 3/5 because no charm."
20459,1473486,4,borjaymaria811,17/08/2021,"Good camping in passing and to visit the city, for a couple of days well, the restaurant very well indeed. recommended if you are not looking for a campsite for long stays"

The sanitary facilities are old but clean, like on some city campsites. I liked the place very much, there are a lot of trees and a pool. And the city is very worth seeing."
20459,1324656,5,kicocc,14/07/2021,"We have been there for two days and we have loved it. The unbeatable situation to go with children. Right next to it is a park with huge slides and a picnic and barbecue area. Right at the exit, the bus stop that leaves you in the city center and the children do not pay. The campsite bar with portions that could be take away at popular prices. Super friendly camping staff. We will be back."
20459,1320362,4,jeandaniel,13/07/2021,"Correct campsite, old but clean sanitary facilities. 10 minutes walk from the Charterhouse of Miraflores (superb).

20459,1310819,1,UnaiVeiga,10/07/2021,"I find it incredible that there are Campsites that say it is 4 stars and I did not get even 1, the facilities in very bad condition and very dirty give privilege to people from outside and not to their clients and very abusive prices for just staying the night."
20459,1302191,5,nomadazaca,06/07/2021,A great campsite well located to visit Burgos and with attentive and very friendly staff.
20459,1301705,4,Smayu,06/07/2021,"We spent two nights without any problems. Part of the facilities we could say that they are somewhat old, but clean and with everything you need to visit the city and be able to rest peacefully.

The individual parking spaces have no separation, everything is open. It's all pretty shabby. At night a church bell rings somewhere at the most senseless times. Ok for emergencies. The operator is very nice and friendly."

We stayed a few nights as the simplicity, natural surroundings and great atmosphere forces us to stay longer than planned.

New, clean sanitary facilities in which not everything is fully functional. Shower rather cool, dishwashing with cold water. Very nice, communicative operator who is probably still suffering from the consequences of the Corona crisis and a forest fire 4 years ago."
20485,1911782,5,zipfbi,24/05/2022,"A very nice, very quiet, individually designed campsite in the middle of the mountains with a fantastic view. We were greeted very friendly and personally by the owner and his son in English. Absolutely to recommend. It is better not to go to Google maps, but first go to the Gouveia police station and then follow the signs to the campsite."
20485,1900265,5,GerdSeifert,19/05/2022,"We stayed here with our mobile home for two days in this wonderful place. The owner was very communicative and extremely friendly. We had our own toilet and shower. All service facilities worked perfectly. After a wonderful hike through the mountains directly from the campsite, there was a cold beer in the bar. We were thrilled by the sunset and the starry sky."

20485,1846761,5,zdouli,22/04/2022,"Very good address, Lionel takes the time to share the attractions of his country. Be careful not to rely blindly on the GPS to find the campsite at the risk of covering miles of tracks..."
20485,1843238,5,Leonhymer,21/04/2022,Very nice home. Private shower without time limit. Nature campsite under the trees and superb viewpoints especially for the sunset (100m from the campsite). The 12km hike accessible to everyone is really very beautiful. 3h30 to 4h. 15€ 2 adults and 2 dogs. The campsite is well fenced to let the dogs run.

In the mountains with a few different hikes around as well as half an hour walk from a town.  Bar very pleasant. Must try the hot chocolates. All facilities great. Recommend getting directions to Gouveia then sat nav to campsite. 12€ a night and facilities to glamping aswell (however we did not use them)
20485,1810567,5,MarinoRottier,08/04/2022,The best place where we have stayed in Portugal so far. The owners are very friendly and we felt welcome instantly. The reception building is cosy and the hot chocolate drinks are yummy. We could park the van where we wanted and were assigned a personal shower and toilet (free!). The view is phenomenal! A 12km hiking trail through the national park starts and ends at the camping. An absolute gem!

A real shot of ❤️"

The site is in an exceptional location, in the middle of the forest, incredibly quiet and right on a beautiful hiking trail of about 4-5 hours, which leads through the picturesque village of Gouveia, among other things. The sanitary facilities are clean. We recommend the campsite 100% :)"

I spent the evening at the bar which is like their living room! The father heated the oven&made chestnuts for the family&for me! I would have spent another night there, but the father warned me from the thunderstorms that arrived the next day! He even explained the best road to go on with my trip!"
20485,1658557,5,deerhouses,23/10/2021,"The location of the campsite is unique. The sunset was sensational. Since we have a relatively large mobile home (7.5 t; 2.45 m wide, 3.75 m high and 7.80 m long) the entrance through the gate was narrow but feasible. We were the only guests that day, but were able to have a warm meal together with the very friendly and helpful hosts in the evening. We would come back again and again!"

It is highly recommended to enjoy a dinner there, great food and for the meager amount you don't have to leave it. From the rocks, in the lee, the sunset is simply amazing. In the Serra de Estrella it is wonderful to walk."

20485,938967,3,Devin,08/08/2020,The campsite is in a beautiful location! You can go hiking in the area and the view from up there is really worth it! The sanitary facilities are new and clean. The place itself is unfortunately not very well maintained. You could do a lot more with it! There is a pool and the price for 2 people and a van is € 11 in the high season. That is also justified.

20487,1883837,2,DUBIN,11/05/2022,"The price is 25€ for 1 night, 2 people and electricity for 1 motorhome. The value for money is really not good. To fill the clean tank you have to use watering cans (not very practical) and for gray water the owner tells us to open his tap and let it flow on the ground.

20487,1478983,5,Pomarinho16518,18/08/2021,"Dear campers.

As owners of Quinta do Pomarinho, we appreciate your review. It gives us the opportunity to change, improve, etc., where necessary.
However, a review with complete untruths (see the review of ""Justfriend"" below) requires a response from our side.
The said person did not want to cooperate with the obligation in Portugal (COVID-19) to submit a vaccination certificate, PCR test or self-on site. Said person thinks this is all nonsense! When it was indicated that one cannot stay at our campsite, they drove off angrily. We are sorry that the person then expresses his frustration in giving a review about a campsite where he stayed for a few minutes before driving away angrily.... The Pomarinho team."
20487,1466875,1,Justfriend,16/08/2021,"Been last month. Ugly campsite, not a single shade, ugly toilet and no real Covid prevention. Pool is a mere farm tank. We immediately drove on without staying overnight. The blunt owner did not like that, they made it very clear."
20487,1465073,4,threeinwood,16/08/2021,Quiet and pleasant. There is a small swimming pool from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. then it is reserved for the adjoining gîte which is part of the campsite
20487,1418059,5,crigbee1,07/08/2021,Lovely campsite with good sized pitches. Owners super friendly and helpful. Easy to visit Castelo de Vide. Lovely walks from campsite which are really pretty. We will return.

20487,1096367,5,Helmutt,17/10/2020,"One of the top 4 or 5 rural camp sites in Europe, that we've stayed at during almost 3 years (in travel time) of touring Europe in our Camper.

Our camper is 7m long and we had no problems. The sanitary facilities are perfectly functional, spotlessly clean and well maintained

If you are looking for a tranquil campsite in a beautiful location, give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."
20487,1004382,4,nunomargalho,26/08/2020,"Nice place, nice owner. Missing the sunset bar.. The small pool fits the kids desire for fresh on summer.Unfortunately no barbecues allowed.."
20487,782787,5,sylduh49,19/02/2020,Super nice walk to do among the cork oaks to go to Castelo de vide. Perfectly clean sanitary. Super location. In short nothing to complain about. The very pleasant gentleman who received us does not speak French. Stayed there for 2 nights
20487,668196,4,pulla,30/08/2019,Super spot with all the amenities. The terrain lacks shade but this is the region.
20487,525747,1,JoyceRichard,23/06/2019,"Price 20€ in June. Startled by unpleasant reception by the new owners. After having looked at the bare shadowless terrain and dated toilet, we did not install and went to another campsite."
20487,513699,3,Chounet,12/06/2019,Much too expensive 20 euros for a night with electricity and with the Acsi card. Poorly defined location and sloping terrain. Go your way.
20487,507512,5,joelledeve,08/06/2019,"What a nice place. Very calm and lost in the countryside, sanitary simple and very clean."
20487,488363,4,RoamingFree,20/05/2019,"Super clean with lovely showers. Our kids enjoyed the chickens and donkeys. The site is rustic in a lovely way, the path in is a little bit rough but we had no issues (ours van is 7m and we had no issues). Would definitely recommend."
20487,323144,4,sveliva,09/08/2018,Nice campsite with a magnificent view of the sunset. Sanitary facilities are clean and there is fresh spring water from our own well everywhere. Cost for two people and campervan 19 €. Owners are super friendly and open
20487,264834,1,fdi,07/06/2018,"Clean but rustic facilities. pitches type ""camping on the farm"". Average home. tariff 1 camper, 2 people without electricity 18 €. No possibility of emptying, in short I advise against."
20487,263793,1,carojp38,04/06/2018,"Required to put 1 star for the comment. Difficult access. No delimited location, neither mowed nor flat. The owner was chatting with people (dutch) and did not even move. 1 girl who speaks only English showed me a sheet with rates.Bref the horror price asked 20 euros so we left as dry but impossible to do 1 / 2tour with trailer and in street to get off a car which fortunately has does she step back"
20487,257612,3,Toucanos,22/05/2018,"Indeed it is not a campsite with tarmac sites, nor with the barriers and flags that accompany the campsites that are made for all those who are not motorhomes. On the other hand, those who love nature in its raw state will be served. The water ? I realized that the owner was putting cisterns and put photovoltaic panels because no electricity. In summary, we are in a campsite but we have the impression of doing the wild which is now almost impossible. In short, you want an international camping, do not come here, no masseuse, no gym. If you want to reconnect with what looks like wild, enjoy yourself here."
20487,250274,1,andreani,10/05/2018,"Desolant, 20 € = location for caravan, road to the limit of the carriage, no drain gray water, nothing to fill the water, it must still be drinkable, which I doubt very much given the facilities. The place is quiet but the Dutch take us for truffles. To avoid."
20487,210135,5,serveuse17,07/11/2017,"Great place 16.50 euros electricity, water drain and washing machine included 2 adults and 2 children, speaks English and not French, great place very clean, showers and toilets, products on sale nice, children loved and especially to see the cows , plan his dinner"

20487,141152,4,plasmat,06/06/2017,"Passage in April 2017, located in the Natural Park of Serra de Sao Mamede. Access via a narrow road but no problem, even for an 8-meter motorhome. Locations of your choice in nature, welcome without fuss by a friendly Dutch who speaks French! Simple but correct installations, reduction 5 euros if Acsi. Walk on GR in the maquis along the cork oak woods until Castelo Vide."

20487,106040,5,romaincayrey,18/09/2016,"A superb setting in the heart of nature, a warm welcome, very clean sanitary. I recommend it for people who like to escape the crowd and privilege authenticity."
20487,76031,1,annicketmarcel,08/06/2016,Unacceptable access by a path whose edges are not maintained. The brushing was done at noon around us without taking care of our presence (at noon and sending herbs and pebbles on the body). We will not be coming back.
20489,3161634,3,VS44,16/08/2023,"Good welcome and activities + facilities / equipment at the top. Sanitary clean however no soap. Regarding the location we had the right to a space just in front of the toilets (literally, with the passage that goes with it), + hornets and wasps galore. Price of €86 (other campsites for the same services are around €28/30 (2 adults + 1 motorhome + electricity)."
20489,3137867,1,DRAKOAGBS,13/08/2023,"It seems excessively expensive to me, a small plot for a motorhome. €40 per night for 2 people and €8 for each child. My children are 4,7 and 16 years old."
20489,2843018,4,IngeLarsenOnTour,11/06/2023,"Nice and quiet place. We have 3 nights here and it was fine. The bar staff was very nice and friendly! The buss to Madrid was next to the campsite and easy to use. No water in the pool, what a shame!"
20489,2678221,4,lipovsga,18/04/2023,"good starting point for Madrid. Bus runs close to the CP. The place has everything you need. Renovations are currently underway around the pool area. Bar nice and friendly. Some places are very difficult to access, but have their own shaded areas for tables and chairs. Nice."
20489,2613117,5,saintamour,17/03/2023,Good value for money. A pitch at 25€ per night with water and electricity is fair. So yes the road is not far but neither is Madrid. If we want calm we go further. We are happy. Shower clean and hot water just right.
20489,2555620,4,.LYDIEJF,19/01/2023,"We plan to stay there for 3 nights. Clean and impeccable sanitary facilities. Very easy to get to Madrid by bus. One negative point: the restaurant!!! the prices indicated on the card do not correspond to the bill: very expensive and not very qualitative. If you want to have a great shopping experience, check out the XANADU mall, (15')...there's even a ski slope!!!"
20489,2501131,4,fredletaz,20/11/2022,"Beautiful and vast campsite, friendly welcome and even in French. Correct prices. Bus 100m away with a super convenient change for Madrid. Bread deposit at the restaurant. Flats drain slab unusable if your cc has the evacuation towards the middle and narrow aisles making maneuvers delicate but in no way impossible. Out of season choose another location and see the reception."
20489,2364448,5,antalvarez,12/09/2022,"We were in November and now in September. They have improved a lot, especially the motorhome area, it is very good. But please, do not clean the floor with noisy tools on the weekend. look for other times"
20489,2322002,3,CABRY,30/08/2022,"Passing through Madrid, we spent 2 nights at the campsite. we had a standard pitch not the top ones. it was very good. The swimming pool is only accessible from 11:00 a.m. and the sanitary facilities were not clean. To go to Madrid we parked in the center of the village to take the bus. It is direct from the village. It takes 45 minutes."
20489,2287762,3,martaklerap,23/08/2022,"We stayed 2 nights, 2 adults, car with roof tent + electricity 70€. Positive - they welcomed us even when we came really late in the evening, after 22:00, but they still let us stay. Friendly staff, but english is a problem here. Pool was nice. Negative - sanitary facilities were new, but women showers very really dirty. Everytime I went, there were many other woman hair, sand etc."
20489,2011760,3,Methni,26/06/2022,"Place ok, but not in balance in terms of price - 75 € two nights with van / 2 adults + baby. In the restaurant area, unfortunately, there was a constant smell of drains. No supermarket, but there are machines from which you can get the essentials. Sanitary ok, but there were few people on the pitch. At full occupancy I think the little cleaning will not be sufficient. Proximity to Madrid ok. About 25 minutes by car. The bus takes about 1 hour and comes very irregularly. The front desk didn't recommend him."
20489,1831027,2,nubad,17/04/2022,"Simple campsite near central Madrid. The toilets were cleaned in the morning so the rest of the day they were dirty and almost always without paper, the showers with sensors. Pitches with abandoned and dirty caravans. They told us that if we arrived later than 00:00 we would have to sleep in the parking lot outside with the camper and the girl could walk to the plot. Totally surreal!!"
20489,1782988,4,ManoloySonia,14/03/2022,"The campsite is quite quiet, it is close to almost everything if you go by car, on the plots you do not hear the noise of the highway, the bathrooms are clean but the taps in the sinks did not work, the showers have a motion sensor and it is very inconvenient you can't turn on the hot water until you're inside, the showers in the men's bathroom were out of order had to go to the women's."
20489,1699548,3,Biscuits,28/11/2021,Clean and practical services even off season. Quiet. Unfortunately in the middle of nowhere with hunting grounds on one side and stream cutting off the path on the other side. Proximity to Madrid nice if willing to negotiate the bus or order an Uber for approx EUR35.
20489,1694377,4,antalvarez,21/11/2021,"Heated toilets, perfect. good cafeteria, a very useful minimarket. Of course, quite a few pitches with fixed caravans are apparently abandoned, dirty. The management of the campsite should not allow it, it detracts."
20489,1430885,4,FamilleHuet,09/08/2021,"We spent 3 quiet nights. The top pitches are right and sloping to put a motorhome. Very pleasant and helpful welcome. Sanitary facilities and clean swimming pools. To visit Madrid 1 hour by bus with 1 change and a perfect Madrid transport app but pay attention to the schedules, we arrived 5 minutes before the schedule the bus had already passed. 50 minutes of waiting."
20489,1322050,4,RPM1970,14/07/2021,"Camping with good facilities and a lot of cleanliness. The pitches with their own bathroom are wonderful. The only but, the restaurant, for the price of the dishes I do not see well that they serve a fairly good meat with frozen bag potatoes. Highly recommended campsite with reasonable prices."
20489,1312114,3,Gaivota,10/07/2021,"Good camping but bad booking service . I made a reservation of a pitch with 70m2 and I receive one with 56m2 full of obstacles. Pitch 43 , when you book by internet , take care, check before go parking . Ok"
20489,845408,2,javicl79,02/07/2020,"Camping next to the highway, crowded and expensive. It is also quite narrow when entering with a large motorhome, there are places where it is almost impossible to turn the corner. Otherwise services like any other camping, nothing special."
20489,782180,4,HAPPYCAMPER2020,18/02/2020,"The place is good, if a bit noisy because of the highway; the connection to Madrid is a bit cumbersome, up to the Retiro 3x changes, 1.5 hours, on the way back you can easily strand in Villaviciosa for one hour .... nevertheless recommended (there are hardly any alternatives)"
20489,722963,4,ngau,16/10/2019,"We spent 2 quiet nights despite the proximity of the highway. The top locations are a fair to put a CC. If there is room, do not hesitate to take a ride to choose. Very nice and helpful home. Sanitary clean. Ideal to visit Madrid 1 hour by bus."
20489,609262,5,Dacavia,08/08/2019,"Great campsite to go with children and visit Madrid center, clean services the attention of the great staff, the plots are of all sizes varying the price. The price within reasonable 48 euros van 2 adults 2 children 10 years and light. The restaurant is great. We will be back."
20489,591938,4,momar,02/08/2019,Perfect campsite to go with children. Some more shade is missing in the plots. Small plot without electricity with two adults € 33. Children pay from 4 years.
20489,552350,1,jerovega7,13/07/2019,"Both boast of bungalows, could also boast of prices, is not normal prices applied for two people in motorhome, € 47, daily. One and no more. Then they pretend that the campers, let's use the camping, not like that."
20489,496336,4,jensen265,29/05/2019,"Great place with rather small areas. Sanitary facilities are impeccable, but that should be expected at 34 € per night (2 people with Campervan)."
20489,468563,4,Katja1234,26/04/2019,"We spent a few days here and it is a nice campsite. The price is at the expensive end for the month of April. Would not recommend the place for big campers, as there is a lot of room to maneuver around, but it went fine for our size (6 meters). The price was 37 for 1 night (camper, two adults and electricity). The wifi worked fine and the facilities were fine."
20489,439020,4,HELIOS5,11/03/2019,"Camping at the gates of Madrid, count 45 minutes by bus to go to the center and 2 buses. We were Saturday and after a long wait (1:30) we arrived at the station behind the Royal Palace. The campsite is ok and the staff friendly. 3 nights, 2 adults and a camper + electricity 69 € with the ACS card. Be careful the aisles are narrow and the maneuvers can be complicated for the big camper. Wifi in the entire campsite and health at the top."

20489,349997,5,jmoutonnet,23/08/2018,"Camping at the gates of Madrid. Great location, pool, restaurant. The noise of the highway does not get along. The location of the drain for the camper is misplaced. A shuttle bus leaving the campsite allows us to go to Madrid."
20489,324868,5,luisete84,10/08/2018,Excellent facilities although the plots are a bit small (for more money they have larger plots available). It is a little more expensive than usual but it is worth it because everything is very well kept and clean.
20489,324346,3,pzdf937,10/08/2018,Clean campsite with large swimming pools with canopy for shade toilets and showers clean but a hot shot and a cold blow for 47 € the night is expensive
20489,303206,4,Delaunayfamily,27/07/2018,Very easy to access from the highway and the campsite being all in length we hear only a purr in the plots of the bottom. The pitches are large with awnings easy to install a clothesline. Sanitary very clean. A bit expensive 47 € for 2 adults and 2 children + electricity but considering the comments of other campsites around Madrid not too much choice ....
20489,300231,4,poupeyou,25/07/2018,Camping very clean dog accepted very friendly staff. we had a very good night's attention the platform for greywater not practical

Price €5 24h. Public toilets 100m away next to the beach bar open from 9am to 7pm every day. Quiet and perfect place to stay for a couple of days, luckily they have set a day limit because before there were fixed motorhomes all year round."

This for me was paradise....... but nothing is perfect."

But just like in Doofland there are many bourgeois (here small Spaniards who are hardly half a head bigger than their dogs), who immediately scream for the police to be on a leash if you let your dog into the water without a leash for a moment."

tay. there is no water or drain. the water tap is outside the Cepsa filling station in a turning circle, but the tap is not working. no water. we went over to Cepsa, paid 2 euros total for 2 lots of water 5 mins each time to fill tank and give us extra water to rinse toilet across the road.
so don't go to this looking water. 
poor facilities for motorhomers."

It has no services but next to it is the ""AC area"" with filling and emptying of black and gray water. Located about 30 min walk from the town center, there is a bus stop on the corner. Important!! We have called the police, you only pay for the months of July and August."

You pay €5 for 24 hours from an app, it's worth it for the proximity to the beach and the place itself. In the morning the Civil Guard passed without any problems. The only downside is the mosquitoes, there is vegetation nearby."

Although some incorrigibles show ""camping behavior"", the police, who drive by several times, do not complain. Nice beach and nice town nearby.

It can be a little over-zealously patrolled by the long-term residents in what is after all a public car park (the photos at the top are of the official area next door). Parking can be tight at times, which can lead to loudly-voiced differences of opinion on rights to living space. Thanks to the local police for their tolerance"
20490,1690744,1,jff,16/11/2021,"The rating with one star is not for the pitch, but for the people who reserve spaces (!) On a free parking space of the city of Rota (THANK YOU for that!) While they are going on an excursion. That is simply anti-social and breaks the sense of such places. What a shame!"
20490,1665852,5,lortagu,28/10/2021,"It is not the atheist who marks the application but it is right next to it Wide area for caravan and camper. We have been two nights with the camper and it is an incredible area. Gray and black water service and water tap, free. One hundred meters from Candor de Rota beach. Highly recommended."
20490,1617472,3,aussteiger1993,29/09/2021,"Great place everything is good .. permanent pamper nerves something with music Spanish mentality is an exception. It happened to us for the first time. If the reputation is ruined, it is unabashed. It's a shame to spend my money in another city. Thank you for the hospitality"
20490,1358067,5,fcoivanpm,24/07/2021,"Now it is regulated as parking for caravans and motorhomes, upon payment of 5 euros per day and a maximum of 72 hours. The only bad thing is that they have set up a concert tent next to it and they are with music until 2:00 a.m."
20490,1205134,3,mdrodcac,18/05/2021,"Both the AC area and the parking lot are crowded, impossible to park. They should regulate the maximum stay 48 hours, there are too many AC parked to spend the whole summer without moving from there. The beach is not recommended for families, there are people doing nudism."
20490,1182441,4,lornajane,30/04/2021,"This parking is separated from the parking with the main services. It's next to the board walk, the dune & the stunning beach which leads you 4 k. East to Rota. A baker comes daily, the local police circle by at night, the dunes are protected  & well maintained.
We have often walked back from Rota along a starlit beach, using the big rador tower as a beacon guiding us home.
Busy at weekends."
20490,1181323,5,lacamp20,28/04/2021,"See comment on the area where there are services, better to park here, be careful however on weekends and high season, probably well stocked given the location"
20490,906187,3,Jasalop,28/07/2020,NO CAMPING. NO AWNINGS. DO NOT TEST OUT. DO NOT PARK ON LINE AND OCCUPYING MORE PLACES. THIS IS NOT A CAMPING. The police and civil guard pass regularly. And they already vacated the area once. Incicive behaviors only harm and bad image the motorhome sector.
20490,882850,4,yasminglez,20/07/2020,"If you come early in the morning there is plenty of parking space, it costs € 2 a day in summer season. We have spent a quiet night with other caravans and campers. Idyllic place to spend the day on the beach."
20490,786323,1,SvenZoellner,25/02/2020,Caution! Local Police regularly takes pictures of motorhomes that are not in the designated parking areas ... You will receive a high Starf money notice by post due to violation of the parking regulations with the associated photo.
20490,772750,1,sbb-2019,26/01/2020,"We came on January 25th. about 30 minutes after the authorities had asked to vacate the place. Few vehicles were still there, even on the move. The others had settled in the other places around. Over night there were about 50-70 womos in the open and parking areas nearby, all of them use the infrastructure, many of the SP as long-term campers, that's not how it was intended!"
20490,770325,5,Chiskis,19/01/2020,"The site is very quiet and there are many motorhomes. The only but, is the proximity of the air base. That planes make a lot of noise when they take off."
20490,744349,3,Holly51,17/11/2019,Very nice place with good V / E. It's quiet at night. Good starting point for long walks on the beach or bike rides. Partly under trees. The course is divided into two different parking spaces. Here you can do it well a week.
20490,735923,4,Steppenwolf_59,01/11/2019,"I was on a car tour (Germany Switzerland France Spain -> Gibraltar -> and back). In the late afternoon of August 2018, I felt as if I was following the sunset. And that's how I ended up at this parking lot. I loved the great beach, the great waves and the pleasantly warm water, around 21: clock. I definitely decided to come back here ... with my RV ... when I'm retired. But what I read here, especially from the locals themselves, makes me think. The Spaniards are right! It is a parking lot! No campsite !!! It should, simply as paying parking lot, be converted with barrier !? If necessary with a weekend ticket or max. 14 ... 28-day ticket to buy at the town hall? And / or especially the community / police should always be successful, in foreign and false use! Especially ""permanent camping"" over two months, in a parking lot must be banned! Otherwise, ... I will come back to see what has become of it ... Greetings from Germany / Baden-Württemberg ..."
20490,621200,2,ferdiamor,12/08/2019,"Undoubtedly the best place for AC, except for permanent occupants, organized in clan to control who stays overnight and even who enters to empty or drink water. They take turns to save the sites, take out chairs and tables, despite being prohibited. While the stay is not limited to a maximum of 48 hours, those who come to spend the night will have to park outside and expose ourselves to the benevolence of the Ilmo. Ayto and security forces and bodies. Hopefully they do not get tired of enduring uncivilized and ban it completely, thus losing one of the most beautiful places and close to all kinds of services next to a spectacular beach."
20490,552464,4,ralberto13,14/07/2019,"Car park for vehicles and with possibility of parking and overnight stay by motorhome. It has next to Free Service Area for Autocaravana. In July and August the park has a cost of € 2 per day. It is next to the beach, with a very good blue flag and very pleasant sea water for bathing continuously."
20490,548618,3,Gorky13,11/07/2019,"Good place next to the beach, we slept 2 nights in our Camper. Filling and emptying of water, with baths during the day, those on the beach. Good company and good conversation with our friend and neighbor the canary ..."
20490,547072,5,MJR,10/07/2019,Thanks to the City Council of Rota for making an area for motorhomes. We do sustainable tourism using bicycles or public transport to visit the cities. We consume just like any other tourist and we have cultural interests because most of us are not flute dogs. Thanks for the bike path. and such a clean city. The Town Halls of Conil and Chiclana could already take note.
20490,532996,5,dani3lin,29/06/2019,"This parking is not the area itself, the area is the other that is marked and where there are services, this is a parking in which we are allowed to spend the night and is just 50 meters from the area to catch or release water. from July 1 during the summer they charge € 2 / day which is still superb. several accesses to the beach from the same parking"
20490,516079,3,Jasalop,15/06/2019,"This area is NOT an area. The Ac area is further behind. This area is a parking lot and during the summer months it is a green zone and a fee. The municipal police and civil guard often go by and if they see that the area is becoming more and more crowded, and even more so if some begin to unfold awnings and remove tables and chairs. Soon they will throw us all out of here. Please. Parking Yes. But camping No. Respect."
20490,504947,5,NunoMiranda,05/06/2019,"Optimal space for motorhomes to park during the day or at night right next to the beach, with all conditions, water supply and gray and black waters. Next to the village and with wonderful pedestrian routes to make through the dunes near the sea and inside the Pine forest. After Seville, through Saluncar de Barrameda and Chipiona this space is unique."
20490,494913,4,fcoivanpm,28/05/2019,"Very good area, but very crowded and difficult to get a place, stick much without moving. There is gas station next door with gas bottles and several services"
20490,492355,4,Vandiamo,25/05/2019,"Love this free Aire, right by the sandy beach. Lots of spaces although does fill up with cars on a weekend but quietens down by Sunday night. Great boardwalks all way into rota & Chiringuito bars have started popping up all along the beach. Bus every half hour into Rota but nice walk approx 2m.   Free services but very tight roundabout at end for large vans, we don’t attempt it (9m)"
20490,490655,5,katradouz,23/05/2019,"A very friendly area with all the free services, two vendors of bread that pass regularly, the beach is immediately behind the dune, nice walks in the forest, all shops nearby and traders who speak English or even a little French. There are indeed people who live on this area, but they work in Rota. It is quite legitimate and the long-term parking is totally allowed by the municipality. You are very welcome here an example for the rest of Spain. On weekends the places are quickly taken but on weekdays it is very calm."
20490,474671,5,sunlightPT,03/05/2019,"Nice place near the beach, quiet, baker in the morning, good agreement with other motorhome. The services are located on the other car park. Hard tap. Congratulations to Rota Town Hall"
20490,460747,4,DanMor,20/04/2019,Very highly water zone. Nearby streets with more comfortable parking. we change waters and park nearby.
20490,448605,5,delavegaRT,03/04/2019,"Hi all, nice place near the beach, nice walk all along the beach and in the pine forests on wooden pontoons beautiful view of Cadiz. The baker goes every morning, I recommend (Christine and Robert)"
20490,443498,4,JuergenD,23/03/2019,Great for free supply and disposal. There would still have been places available. But we wanted to continue.
20490,439941,1,gusepe,14/03/2019,"The location on the beach is good, but the locals take out chairs, tables, throw themselves 3 months fixed, the police pass and do nothing. The tap of clean without thread and the gray does not fit well or is not level, taking all the water under the motorhomes and the bad smell that leaves"
20490,434642,2,big,28/02/2019,"Many people on the three car parks even in February, area passes me the salt, but for the services. big02"
20490,429934,5,Serge36159,16/02/2019,"Only a few places available every day, many are taped. Parking next door can meet the demand. Quiet and all free services, thank you."
20490,427479,1,antonio1,08/02/2019,"In Sanlúcar de Barrameda, in Chipiona they ended up prohibiting the parking of motorhomes. Or among all (especially the Spaniards, who are the ones who can hurt us the most), we veto these illegal and incivil practices, calling and reporting it to the local police or in a couple of years this car park / area will also have disappeared Let's apply common sense."
20490,427160,1,carlossuperfandango,06/02/2019,3 weeks ago I tried to get an overnight  parking place here  but was unsuccessful. I have now returned and it is full of the same people who think it is ok to live here. Trailors parked in spaces where others cant park solar panels awnings with chairs and tables disgusting selfish people.
20490,425426,2,carlossuperfandango,29/01/2019,Agree with review below. Some person taking 6 spaces for himself. Trailor car chairs and tables. This is a carpark not a camping ground. Why cant we all be sensible? 5 years ago this place was beautiful. Now spoiled by people who think its ok to live there.
20490,421364,2,nafrobmk1,09/01/2019,"Van people avoid! full of motorhomes parked sideways taking up 3 spaces each chairs and motor cycles taking up more room, got here late and parked in a layby up the road."

20490,415254,4,cathyoung,21/12/2018,Stayed here in Dec for 2 nights.  very peaceful and safe.  Police regularly patrol.  Bread van comes around in the morning.  service tight but all in working order and clean.
20490,413840,2,vanlifebuilds,12/12/2018,"If you have a van, don’t park here, there are way better places to park. The good thing about this place is that there are services"
20490,407412,4,Sissi22,14/11/2018,"We stayed for two nights, super quiet, we were at the car park next to the area which is saturated. Beautiful setting. Motorized, 5 km to the port, we took the ferry to visit Cadiz. In addition, at the supermarket Dia you have a launderette."
20490,391322,1,antonio1,11/10/2018,"SHAMEFUL. The best places are caught by foreigners who have been camped for 2 and 3 months turning the area into a settlement, clotheslines, awnings etc. The worst thing that has outraged me most today is when I observe how an Englishman tells another Englishman that he is going to leave the square (of the good ones) so that he can occupy it. With this, we Spaniards have no choice. They warn each other. SHAME"
20490,387943,5,-bruno,05/10/2018,"Very quiet place, with all services, close to the beach. Thank you to the town hall."
20490,387360,5,blanc.carole,04/10/2018,"Super free area 2 steps from a beautiful beach with refreshment bar and toilet. There were 10 other campers who all respected the hygiene and cleanliness of the place; tip top so! The trick to go to Rota and take the boat (35mn, 5.20 € one way) to visit Cadiz is really good; very nice day trip!"

20490,355424,2,SADESA,27/08/2018,"Area with tap without thread, the discharge of bad gray water located very close to the parking lot and there are some that do not take care when emptying leaves and leaves bad smell. On the other hand there are a few regulars and it seems as if the area were theirs. The responsible ones would have to take letters in the matter and put a cap of days. In short, we went to a parking lot that is behind and very well ..."
20490,335308,2,Jasalop,15/08/2018,"The area is in a magnificent site. Since the beach is wonderful. The clean water tap has no thread. And the current of gray water is badly made. And the gray water, instead of running towards the chest, runs below the acs, giving rise to a very bad smell. But the biggest problem is the same as always, people do not respect deploying the awnings. And that is camping. And so it goes."
20490,322917,4,anditz33,09/08/2018,"The site is fine, it has water and water drainage. The problem is that there are people who notice that they are in season, and they occupy a lot of space, especially the French. We have been alone one night, and it is a quiet place and very good to spend one or several nights."
20490,319629,3,mayen,07/08/2018,"It is quite good the only thing that the bad do of some users that put the motorhomes taking two seats, if they were well delimited would be much better. a greeting"
20490,312987,5,chally,03/08/2018,"The parking lot in the area also has a € 2 ticket per day, the parking lot mentioned above has a sign indicating that it is only for cars, although there are always motor homes."
20490,312888,4,Anakin,03/08/2018,Right now it's full. Frenchmen with awnings outside. THAT CAN NOT BE DONE!! Nearby there is a parking 2 € / 24h with possibility of shade. There we are just parked without taking out nasa. So SI !.
20490,297776,1,jfescoriza,23/07/2018,"Horrible, a lot of noise, long-stay camping people ... it shows that it's free"

20490,231926,5,freedomforlife,01/04/2018,Here now 2nd day. A bit busy but ok. not to much noise. Very relaxed. Beach is only a 2 minute walk away and clean. water and wast at the end of the Aires. Had to fill water containers up as no screw fitting on tap. but not a problem. Police patrol round to keep an eye on things. Bread van comes round in the morning. Loads of little bars and Restaurants around if you fancy popping in to Rota.
20490,223437,4,Maispa,18/02/2018,"Water intake does not work, you have to take it from a hose on the ground, otherwise it's very full."
20490,220259,5,Marquesmm,26/01/2018,"Perfect area, the wooden footbridges take you to Rota through a wonderful pine forest environment, and in winter our dog has had a great time on the beach as many people take him for a walk."
20490,218407,3,marcandsam,10/01/2018,Free services so thank you municipal council. However the Aire was packed like sardines so did not stop
20490,216411,4,bernard695,29/12/2017,"A little small area for large vehicles but has the merit of existing. The free services, the guardia often goes to monitor, and large car parks are available a little further. Very popular with foreigners on 30 camper I am the only French"
20490,215046,4,phil0o0o,16/12/2017,"Most: restaurants 500 meters, 3 km departure for Cadiz by boat, cycling / walking, not far from the beach, free services. The -: no electricity, reduced spaces, water flow, some camper cupping, a limit of 72 hours would be welcome."

20490,211548,5,daviddiasjesus,17/11/2017,"Quiet parking, 15 min walk from the center and 10 from the beach. with free water and water discharge services. At this time of year there are several places."

20490,194628,4,tata13,17/09/2017,"Well located. All free services. Beach very close, bike path to the town, gas station opposite. Few car parks, but well distributed. One side is in battery and another in line, so that longer vehicles can park and let go for emptying and filling."
20490,183020,3,Maispa,23/08/2017,Very crowded almost all camping good ejm is better in the parking that is attached to the area for € 2 day green area until the end of August after free much more extensive and without settlement. In any case there is plenty of parking around.
20490,180893,2,aei,20/08/2017,"I returned two weeks later and in one of the rows they follow the same positions, they do not even move to empty the deposits. It also gives me the feeling that they are parked against each other, so we enter half of the motorhomes. the site is very good but what a pity they do not put a maximum stay. The place otherwise is fine, beach nearby, gas station and bus that takes you to the center"
20490,180249,3,Chary,20/08/2017,"Well located and adapted area, only drawback that the campers of the area are seen with the freedom to be there all summer without giving the option to those who arrive in step to park there and visit the town. Please! Let's wake up in this country and make good use of the areas."
20490,175427,1,izquierdo,15/08/2017,"Perfectly located area to enjoy the beach, somewhat removed from the center of Rota but you can go well by bike. The problem that observed ..! is that there are local motorhome enthusiasts and there is no way to stop in the area and let the rest of the team come to visit the city or its surroundings."
20490,172235,4,michnitro,12/08/2017,"Good service area, with plenty of spaces, although in summer it is difficult to find a free space, you can park past the area without problem."

20490,170832,4,pmoura,10/08/2017,Nice place to stay a few nights.really close to the beach and with a good bicycle path.
20490,166980,1,izquierdo,06/08/2017,"Very good area to rest and spend a few days and nothing else ..! The problem that we have seen ... is that there is an increase in local motor caravanners and they do not let the fellow campers who are biking around leave a single station. free,"
20490,162400,3,centrodelsur,31/07/2017,We were on July 28. There is a comfortable bike ride from the area to the town. Emptying and filling free. The bad thing is the large number of motorhomes that have been there for a long time and that leave few places for those who are traveling. There is more room to park in the back.
20490,155791,5,CristinaLlamas,22/07/2017,Perfect. Quiet. Full. In front of the beach. Near Rota.
20490,154408,4,Ernes,19/07/2017,"Well located, close to a very good beach with all services. The parking is green, € 2 for a day. For draining gray water and water intake. Quiet place to sleep."
20490,150982,4,Pinasho,13/07/2017,Very well located. On these dates it is at half capacity.
20490,142676,5,beabeys,12/06/2017,"Perfect. Just comment on an incident that I witnessed: there is no signboard at the entrance and there was a roteño who parked the car, just above the gray water drain, without knowing that this square should not be occupied.In that period of time no AC was able to empty. When the person went for his car, he had the door scratched. These actions do not benefit, on the contrary."
20490,137282,3,Luc,25/05/2017,"Free service area, they are rare in the area, clean water tap with push button and without thread. Overnight stay possible."
20490,133230,3,Mamen8cc,05/05/2017,The place is very complete and easy to get to. The only bad thing is that some parked the motorhome occupying 3 spaces without any consideration.
20490,129564,4,rgrous,20/04/2017,"Located a few meters from the beach, but far from the town. At Easter everything was already busy."
20490,128406,5,davidsuroeste,16/04/2017,Very quiet place with bike lane and bus stop to go to Rota for €1.15. There are cars that have been there for months. The truth is that it's a shame. Thank goodness there is another parking lot behind it so there is more space. In summer it will be more crowded. Free water and emptying
20490,127368,4,Mamen8cc,14/04/2017,Complete and very quiet service area. Close to gas station and beach. The only bad thing is that there are people who park the motorhome occupying 3 spaces.
20490,123582,3,wroclawdan,21/03/2017,For drains and water OK. But if you like peace and quiet... you'll have to come back. The motorhomes are parked next to each other. Holidays in an apartment are not for me and that's why I chose the campervan!
20490,120635,4,Imalaphil,19/02/2017,"Great stopover, free and all facilities. Parking also available down towards the beach. Has got quite busy lately. Bar close by, petrol station across road. Very quiet area. 45 minutes walk to Rota town which is quite nice."
20490,120093,3,katradouz,14/02/2017,"Indeed there is a free ""area"" so we do with ... aim the microscopic grid for emptying and provide a container, the drinking water tap has no thread. Inaccessible to large vehicles. The parking lot is very small and suddenly the neighboring parking lot is taken by storm. The site is not ugly, a nice walk along the coast on cobblestones and wooden walkways and a beach accessible further ahead (if you endure the recycling center.)"
20490,114571,2,mange,18/11/2016,"Area that only retirees enjoy when they arrive at the first of summer, taking all the sites and enjoying ""a private area"" for them, having an all summer stay. Depriving of power overnight any motorcaravan user who is en route."
20490,113537,4,Silvialike,06/11/2016,"Very small area, with a small roundabout to change direction. Very close to the beach but not the town."
20490,110392,3,willvy,18/10/2016,"In this second stay I am observing that there are many motorhomes that remain in the area for more than three days, and that must be prohibited because if they want to camp they go to a campsite. There are some who take advantage of the area to spend the holidays. The philosophy of using this mode of travel is broken. The rights of some end where the one of the others begins."
20490,100477,3,cesarbracho,27/08/2016,It's pretty good next to the beach but for these dates very busy until long hours in the morning but for € 2 a day is not to ask for more ok
20490,93419,5,jpg35421,12/08/2016,Excellent location. 2n€ per day with services and by the beach.

20490,76882,3,willvy,14/06/2016,"Area close to the beach, quiet although with a lot of motorhome movement in the area. The drinking water supply site and discharge area are quite good. The toilets are typical of a busy area. It's good to go to the beach for a few days."
20490,76050,4,Max85,08/06/2016,"Quiet area except Friday, Saturday and Sunday invaded by the Spaniards not very discreet and especially not scrupulous about cleanliness, unfortunately.. On Sunday evening they empty their gray water directly on site, while there is everything on site for free, but do not don't want to wait."
20490,74576,3,RoseOlivia,25/05/2016,Nice place right by the beach and access to toilets (not very clean) and outdoor showers on the beach. Free to stay and water and waste disposal available. No shade but quiet and feels safe away from main roads. Plenty of shops and bars nearby.
20490,67502,4,amg01,05/04/2016,"Very good area, quiet. Walk along the seaside to the village which is quite far away. We slept there 2 nights, many camper vans, the services at the terminal were functional."
20490,67411,4,on6gps,04/04/2016,There are several parking lots around the service station. Police passed by without any comments (April)
20490,67332,4,chauray79,04/04/2016,Alright. A little far from services. Bus to go to the city center and the pier every hour.

20490,32531,4,cic1002,26/03/2015,"Clean and quiet. On the other hand, no water the day we were there. We found a water point at the entrance to the beach (150 m) which allowed us to save ourselves a few cans. It is best to have bicycles to reach the boat shuttle to Cádiz (5 km)."
20490,31283,4,boutderoute,19/02/2015,"Friendly and clean communal area, free. Close to the sea by a wooden footbridge. Complete services. The town of Rota is worth visiting. Treat yourself to a boat trip to visit Cádiz for €10."

20493,2853649,3,Reiziger14,14/06/2023,"Yes it works, but it's not the cleanest place. It stinks and there are a lot of flies. The drinking water tastes good. But it's hard to fill a jerry can. Doesn't fit well underneath so I had to do the last bit with small bottles. It's easier if you have a garden hose! I only came here for the services, didn't stay overnight. It doesn't look like you can spend the night there."
20493,2717652,2,HugoMiguel,02/05/2023,"very dirty and unkept place, but free. enough to empty the dirty water and fill the water tank. I was still waiting to use the services, because in front of me there were two horse-drawn caravans that filled many water bottles typical of people in that area who take advantage of the place because it is free. it didn't seem safe to sleep AC Micas do Jaime gives 2 stars"
20493,2643182,4,fwm1950,06/04/2023,"Navi led us to the large parking lot, but the parking space is directly to the left of the fire brigade! A power cable hangs on the wall. We paid 5 euros at the office. Unfortunately we often heard engine noises from the fire brigade during the night."

20499,1787511,5,caroliua,19/03/2022,"We went there with our van in early March and had a very good time. The beach is also great and dogs are not a problem at this time of the year. Unfortunately, huge mobile homes parked across 4-5 parking spaces and showed camping behavior. Locals looked annoyed for a reason. Please show more respect so that the space can continue to remain open to everyone."
20499,1786053,5,Chantal33,17/03/2022,"March 17, 2022 arrived at 5 p.m. to just spend the night there because of the storm. 5 motorhomes were already there. On the other hand, it is just a car park so do not go there on weekends or in high season out of respect for local residents. Clean place. The land next door is closed, barriers I think there has been abuse by some motorhomes as specified in the comment below."
20499,1777011,3,DanArKemper,08/03/2022,"Although out of season, avoid weekends because locals have the right to park. No service, beach 30 meters away. Please leave the place clean."
20499,1772255,1,Gerd247,03/03/2022,"I'm shocked, it looks like a campsite now. It is parked across several parking lots, chairs and tables are put out and therefore looks like an overcrowded campsite! Surely this won't last much longer! Definitely 12 to 15 vehicles, including very large mobile homes. There is hardly any space left for local cars, the main thing is that you are on the beach!!! drove further."

20499,1744345,5,Latrujimerlo,30/01/2022,"We have slept very comfortably over the weekend, not a single noise, there were other Ac. The bad thing is that there is nowhere to get water or empty gray but there are public toilets next door that were open although we have not used them. It is at the foot of the promenade. At this time of year perfect because there are hardly any people and you can be comfortable."

At night the police came by and did not say anything, but the one with the tickets came to check first thing in the morning and told us that we had to put 2 tickets because we were occupying more than one place. Also at night there is a lot of noise. Young people pass by at all hours, very noisy."
20499,1240375,5,Milagritos_t4,06/06/2021,"We have spent two nights without any problem. On the weekend it gets relatively crowded during the day with people going to the beach, but in the afternoon it is completely empty.

20499,1135439,5,stefansmink,06/02/2021,Perfect spot for camper vans. Next to the beach and the parking is actually pretty 'private' since it is surrounded by trees and a high hedge. No facilties during Covid times.
20499,1135320,5,Elenita39,05/02/2021,"Very well located, shady beachfront, children's park and dog's beach 2 minutes away! there were bathrooms but they were closed. The town a 10 minute walk is very beautiful and there is a pizzeria with Italian owners, which brings the pizza to the caravan!"

20499,1092345,5,manitu9,13/10/2020,"An ideal place in October, the possibility of taking tables and putting up a roof passes the police and does not say anything very welcoming. Use a 200m container and no bins so that we are not prohibited from being there. 100% recommended out of summer season"

The bathrooms have been closed on October 1, but there are others along the promenade (if you look at the sea, to the left), you have to pass the tourist building and find them. the quiet and shady place, a step away from the beach."
20499,795529,4,AnaBanana,14/03/2020,"It remains a parking lot but practical with clean public toilets. A little gloomy in the middle of winter because the city can seem a little ""ghost"", nobody in the streets arriving at 22h. But more lively during the day, and then a few other motorhomes present were suddenly a little reassuring."
20499,794623,4,Mark74,12/03/2020,"Ideal and quiet place for a stopover. Too bad that some (still the same registered in northern Europe) can not help but take out deckchairs, chairs, tables and solar panels, which is prohibited. These same motorhome operators fill the beach bins while it is stipulated by the municipality to put our waste in the containers available to us."
20499,794299,2,HansClever,11/03/2020,"As of yesterday, a contact-payment barrier will now be installed and it will soon be over with free parking. In the end there were only big pensioner yoghurt cups, close together, so that they could see something from the sea. Creepy!"

There is a sign posted by the city council for motorhomes that warn of throwing garbage in the containers next to it, not in the bins that if so continue will limit the entrance so we can not enter. Let us respect all so that they do not close it, that we complain later."
20499,777097,4,MmeRobertRoche,07/02/2020,"We spent the night there and no problem, the only downside is that some motorhomes do not pick up the ""droppings"" of their dogs and the site will certainly become very dirty if it were to continue."
20499,758323,5,snitchblanca,28/12/2019,"Very quiet place next to the beach. There were public toilets, shade, park for children. The trees are somewhat low and you have to be careful.

20499,220951,5,debbiefletch,31/01/2018,"Excellent spot, quiet yet safe, with access to clean toilets. 6 other vans there 30/1/18. Would recommend as stopover or if visiting the area. Great to be able to walk along the promenade"

20499,204460,4,Noldor,20/10/2017,"Very good place, places for cars, near the beach but we have to take good care of it or take it away. It's parking in the village and they use it a lot. Just overnight without taking anything out."
20499,195750,4,bleiz,20/09/2017,Well hidden at the end of the dead end on the right.
20499,189544,3,Wally_Louis,03/09/2017,Free between 8pm and 9am otherwise ticket required all day days of the week. Quite noisy from summer carnival sort of thing next door until 1am (stayed on a Saturday night). Lots of birds in the trees looking to poop on your van at dusk.
20499,139399,4,nelapop4nite,30/05/2017,"Great spot, clean tidy, well lit. Toilets also good Herbie Hymer"

20499,121308,5,lucebinouze,25/02/2017,"Great place out of season, we were there on February 23, 2017. The car park is surrounded by hedges that allow a tranquility compared to the pedestrian promenade. We were in a van and were able to eat outside without disturbing etc. The toilets clean and open all the time, the beach 1 minute! Quiet at night during this time of the year."
20499,114781,4,Chamois38,22/11/2016,"Parking accessible out of season, quiet, very clean environment and sanitary facilities, beautiful beach and pleasant seaside promenade."

20499,66252,4,joshi_es,25/03/2016,"We have come during Holy Week, and we are calm. Right now we are only 2 motorhomes and our van. There are public services (WC), and we are right on the waterfront. We are on the seafront, and there are restaurants right next door. In summer, I do not know if it will be possible to park, but we will spend the night today. 3/25/2016"
20512,3281756,2,ledeannadine,10/09/2023,"disappointing dirty campsite, inflatable swimming pool, not enough electrical boxes for the number of pitches (during my absence I was disconnected and reconnected to a household power strip). positive point beach access. I will not return"
20512,3260713,5,AnaGuerra,05/09/2023,"The area is well located, very quiet. Although it closes at 7pm, it welcomed us at 10pm. We will stay again."
20512,3224763,5,jgoiko,27/08/2023,"The area is very good and advisable, bathrooms, showers and sinks with hot water, Wi-Fi, electricity, with filling and emptying included in high season for €20, there is a small pool at the entrance, a store 2 minutes away and a supermarket a 10, to 100 m. from the beach, it is true that the road can be a little dirty, but it is outside the area and you cannot blame it for something that is not yours."
20512,3221365,5,bouquet87,26/08/2023,Ideal for walks friendly staff very good welcome very well delimited pitches I can see myself spending a fairly calm winter there I hope to be able to come back soon
20512,3202819,5,madugr,23/08/2023,"A small campsite. We were warmly welcomed by the owner. The place was clean and the sanitary facilities as well. Was also left clean by the guests. The way to the beach takes some getting used to, but it's just over a dune. Price €25 a night for 4 people including unlimited electricity in the middle of high season is really cheap. 50 m to the sandy beach which is worthwhile."
20512,3173179,3,PatrickHueter,18/08/2023,Was okay. Toilets does not suffer clean. Way to the beach also very dirty. Have been received friendlier. Very small parking space. Positive: beach and electricity without limit.
20512,3149353,5,Furgopitecus,15/08/2023,"A success, there are not many areas attached to the beach. This has all the services, friendly staff, next to the beach, close to a beach bar, restaurants and a kite spot next door. To put a but, there are no shops nearby, so the best thing is to arrive with a well-loaded pantry to spend some fantastic days at the beach."
20512,3136048,5,FloshiFlo,13/08/2023,"Very nice pitch! We actually only wanted to stay for 1 night and ended up staying 3 nights. We think €20 a night for 2 adults, 1 child under the age of 3 and a dog + electricity is cheap. Direct access to the beach (dogs are tolerated). The toilet facilities were cleaned regularly and the staff was very friendly :-) Shops and restaurants are within walking distance. If you don't get a parking space, you can park in front of the door. We would love to come back here."
20512,3080967,5,isidrosanchez,05/08/2023,"Beachfront area. It has a small pool for children, showers and bathrooms, all the times I have been, clean. Filling and emptying area at the entrance of the area. Gravel pitches level and almost no cleats necessary and some well shaded, maybe a bit narrow but not a problem. Special mention to the kindness with which we have been treated at reception."
20512,3008970,4,Joebo,23/07/2023,"Very nice operator, good English. Very close to the beach. Shops nearby. Toilets/showers have been cleaned several times a day, but unfortunately very small Warsaw (2 showers 1 toilet)"
20512,2935190,1,wemovetogrow,07/07/2023,"We wanted to have a look around before making a decision. A man shouted from a distance that we had to wait before looking for a spot. We walked on to the beach. Not much soup for the rest. A stretch of sand with mobile showers and toilets. Places were nearby, even in the summer"
20512,2910318,2,Mampfredo,01/07/2023,We are now at this beautiful spot for the third time. But this time very disappointed. The operators have changed - the place is very neglected. Especially the cleanliness of the toilets and showers left a lot to be desired. Hasn't been cleaned at all for days. Under these circumstances we will not be returning. Price in HS €20.
20512,2899252,5,EDS0368,27/06/2023,Good welcome. Area with all services. A beautiful beach nearby. This is the second time we have come and are delighted. Just to review the locks of the sanitary doors.
20512,2876891,5,KnightBusTravel,21/06/2023,Super friendly welcome and everything you need is there! Would definitely come again. Paid €14 including electricity for one night. :-)
20512,2855059,4,osamanie,14/06/2023,"Good area next to the beach, it has everything you need to spend a few days comfortably. By putting a snag excessive dust from an adjacent path."
20512,2843422,1,Calimero125,11/06/2023,"Area appreciated in 2022, much less this year. The reception staff are cold and distant. the hygiene and the state of the toilets leaves something to be desired, The toilets, showers and dishwashing trays are cleaned in a “hurry” in a very random way. In short, the dust from the road, plus the wifi that works half the time It's decided we won't be going back there!"
20512,2826656,5,Vantastico_pl,06/06/2023,We did service for 5 euro (instead of 18 that we've been offered few kilometres further)
20512,2702697,2,stephmick,28/04/2023,"Very cold reception. Little privacy, separation by a barrier that is broken. If you go to the toilet, put the paper in the trash and not in the toilet. Imagine yourself as a woman, for example. The emptying of your vehicle is right in the middle of the area between the showers and the toilets."
20512,2695617,4,Saskia0812,25/04/2023,"Well located right on the beach. Many permanent campers. Place seemed dead, were on 28.3. here for one night in transit. Negative: V / E directly between the two places. If you want to get out of the back seat, you can't get through here."
20512,2694329,5,bengi69,24/04/2023,Very lovingly built mobile home parking space on gravel. Direct access to the beach. Unfortunately we are only here for one night in transit. But come back another time for a few days

20512,2650973,4,Yannick59welcom,08/04/2023,"Very warm welcome, pleasant campsite, lots of people in January, near the beach, speaks French, Reasonable price, very good location and sanitary facilities."
20512,2631002,5,TraianVoineagu,30/03/2023,"we went to stay only a night. ended up staying 3 days. if we weren't in a bit of a hurry, we might stayed longer. exceptional staff, super friendly. nice camping, not too crowded, quiet in this time of the year. nice and clean facilities. wifi, showers without timers, barbeque, fast acces to beach. a spar supermarket and a few bars only open in town, nothing else to do but relax. we recommend"
20512,2580833,4,annie.paleni,17/02/2023,We stayed one night for 10 eur + 4 eur electricity. It is very full so reservation is recommended. Facilities are clean and nice with hot water. Access to electricity is not next to each pitch so make sure you have an extension court long enough.
20512,2576175,4,laura2529,12/02/2023,"Stayed 1 night for 10€ + 4€ for electric. Showers are high pressure, no push buttons/timers and hot, it was worth staying just for them. A short walk to a long beach that seemed to be dog friendly. Tripped the electric trying to use our electric hob, so assume the amperage is lower than usual. Knocked off a star as the vans are packed in, which doesn’t seem safe and lacks privacy."
20512,2572082,1,Mivo,08/02/2023,It's terrible how the mobile homes are crammed together on an unsightly site!! Gruesome!
20512,2570113,5,garneleauftour,06/02/2023,"Totally nice owner, everything very clean and well maintained and you are 50 m from the beach. Were super happy there!"
20512,2570098,5,Tobe_or_not,06/02/2023,"Nice place..nice operators and everything you need is there. Price was 10€ a night, 4€ electricity. Very close to the beach, dog does not cost extra"

20512,2560432,5,dref59,25/01/2023,"What can I say except extraordinary, a warm welcome from Marcella and André who are always ready to listen, present for anything. Very very clean sanitary facilities. Everything is there on this area, we came for one night and stayed there for two months, pure happiness, a wonderful atmosphere between motorhomes of all origins. We will return"
20512,2551423,5,AndreaRalfMo,14/01/2023,Super nice quiet CP. We only wanted to stay one night and it turned out to be 8. Nice people and right on the beach. Shopping is also great. Great walks through the plantations. Toilets always clean. We'd love to come back. We paid 12 euros including electricity.
20512,2532339,2,wjwenkeler,29/12/2022,"Although close to the beach, it is completely overcrowded and the way there is full of bags of dog waste. even hang in the tall bushes. what a pity the spot could have been kept more attractive. the pictures are misleading. we didn't stay. the surroundings look like a neglected backyard."
20512,2529117,4,JamesAshby,26/12/2022,"A nice very friendly place with all facilities and laundry washing/drying. It was very busy as other reviews have said with lots of long term campers, but a nice atmosphere. Not loads of space but separated pitches and decent showers etc... Near to nice beach and town with a Spar. Depends what you're after but worked for us for a couple of nights."
20512,2527686,3,ninamalina,24/12/2022,Nothing special. Only close to sea. No privacy. Weird feeling being there. We moved to another camp close by. Much better.
20512,2512929,4,andmira,04/12/2022,"Now called ""La Finca"". Very crowded, they didn't have a single place free. He finally gave us a spot that had been reserved for the next day. Price still EUR 10/night, but Electricity now EUR 4."
20512,2508593,4,Jojyb,29/11/2022,nice welcome. the area is very large but very busy. many motorhomes stay there for a long time. clean toilets. very hot water. possible with large motorhome and trailer. some locations you have to unhook the trailer
20512,2502592,4,lisaprincipessa,22/11/2022,"Very tight, mobile homes are close together. Not an idyllic place, BUT: right on the beach, really hot showers, free good WiFi, all services and for only €10 a night. dogs welcome We stayed 3 nights instead of 1 night. Reception open from 9am-1pm and 3pm-7pm."
20512,2486589,5,AgnesTimmons,07/11/2022,Couldn't get closer to the sea. Very nice spot with nice hosts Andrey & Marsela. Clean facilities. We stayed over two weeks for the convenience.
20512,2472295,1,Camille37,30/10/2022,"Crammed together, no privacy, we didn't stay."
20512,2439513,3,wayneinteressierts,12/10/2022,White wall on mobile homes. Very tight. Didn't stay and drove on.
20512,2365642,5,KarloCamper,12/09/2022,"Super pitch, right on the sea, behind the small dune. Footpath to the beach about 50 meters. Huge beach, so there are hardly any people on the beach in the area of the parking space. We are excited. Just paid €20 per night. Friendly operator. Place clean and well maintained. close to town!"
20512,2360585,4,linus0208,11/09/2022,"It's almost impossible to get close to the beach. there is a private access to the beach and the place is also nicely laid out. the beach is really very nice and there are also showers. Everything very clean and well-kept. However, the only campsite that is still in high season in September and therefore also increases prices, which are still okay. we paid €20/night including everything"
20512,2332686,5,dsvidydesi,02/09/2022,"The photos are not fair for how cool and great the place is ... Everything is super clean, a great atmosphere, super nice people, access to the beach a bit of a mess to put a little problem but come on, you walk 4 minutes and you enter from another side .We have been 4 days and delighted."
20512,2319591,4,Peyadama,29/08/2022,"We entered later than the time they have set. The reception closes at 7:00 p.m. Still, the AC is open. We entered and a user told us that there would be no problem staying overnight and in the morning the owner would check us and it is €20 with services and electricity and €5 for each child over 5. €30 a night for two adults and two children over 5. Check out is at 1pm, leave us more because it's not full."
20512,2278175,4,UrbanTraveller,21/08/2022,"Suitable RV site. Very close to the beach. It has a small football field with artificial grass for children and a small plastic track. The town itself has nothing and we found it outdated. To make a point, the people who come by car to the nearby beach bar make a lot of noise. It cost us €20 with electricity."
20512,2233890,1,manu013,14/08/2022,"A horror, a horrible night, we were right next to a parking lot where young people made a mess! They started at 12:30 a.m. until 1:30 a.m. and it continued from 5 a.m. to 6 a.m., music from their car, shouting, 30€ per night (August 13), 4 ampere electricity, not enough to put on an air conditioning. Only 1 star for the reception and the direct access to the beach."
20512,2226623,4,agravia,13/08/2022,"Very good area with impeccable bathrooms but small plots, a lot of noise at night and as already mentioned, from 7am workers, cars and other annoyances. However, the best in the area. Thanks."
20512,2219928,4,viajero.,11/08/2022,"It is a place with a lot of charm!, but…. extortionate prices in July, August and part of September. For them it is high season in winter. Let's park at the door, which is legal."
20512,2185859,4,monfermat,06/08/2022,"Perfect for going to the beach... the owner is very nice and the facilities are good, very adequate for its price. The town is not much, very simple."
20512,2121247,2,W2T,25/07/2022,"The place has everything, but the sanitary facilities are getting old. Direct access to a beautiful sandy beach. However, at night very loud music from nearby bars and early in the morning construction workers & street noise."
20512,2118260,3,SPQR56,24/07/2022,"Beach at 150 m. Fill water: more than 470 ppm. For me, not drinkable!"
20512,2109784,5,ErikThomann,23/07/2022,"Nice place, the price is okay. The sanitary facilities are very clean and it is only a 3-minute walk to the beach. I would recommend it..."
20512,2071577,5,Hoi15,14/07/2022,Beautiful pitch by the sea. Nice owners. Quiet location.
20512,2051836,3,Rutera13,08/07/2022,"In area it is correct, but I don't like that they leave caravans, because some set up some semi-fixed beach bars that believe that the area belongs to them and are very scandalous, for that it is better to go to a campsite."
20512,2024219,4,latecoaire,30/06/2022,Very good nothing to complain about! Avoid places on the dusty and noisy side of the road.
20512,2020747,4,Carjan,29/06/2022,"3 days very pleasant for €15 pd including electricity. Facilities well taken care of, easy access to nice beach. Restaurants, ice cream parlor and spar within walking distance. Friendly owner. So fine. Just the many dogs with their owners who don't pay close attention. Barking, growling, sometimes loose."
20512,2008240,4,edugiansante,25/06/2022,"15 euro with energy, water, showers in June so pretty good. Only downside is that there’s literally nothing around. Beautiful sand beach dog friendly, but no chiringuitos. Supermarket is prob 2km or more away - there are two or three small restaurants but no dogs inside. Staff here is friendly and it’s good to chill."
20512,1971626,5,Calileo,12/06/2022,Great !! Very clean and very well maintained area by top staff - More than fair price for an area that offers the same services as a campsite.

20512,1927983,4,traveljw,29/05/2022,"Ideal for campers (10€ without electricity). Nice greeting from staff and fellow tenants. Close to the sandy beach. Water and toilets OK. Just a little tight places. Build a solar system. Let's see if that makes a difference on the electricity price (electricity in Spain is expensive and time-dependent, see app 'Precio de la Luz' )"
20512,1923579,3,peoplecalled,28/05/2022,"Value for money is really great. For 10€ with showers and toilet you can't say anything. But it is a ""white mobile home landscape"". The place and beach is not particularly nice. Very narrow places."

In progress for a few days, a giant inflatable pool!"

20512,1845166,5,F.Alvarez,22/04/2022,A few meters from the beach and the restaurant area. Highlight the kindness of the workers. Improvable facilities.
20512,1802264,3,MimoOnTour,31/03/2022,"Price and cleanliness okay, but we felt like sardines in a can. Small pitches, more like a parking lot. We didn't want to spend more than one night here. Attention: Many permanent campers who seem to spend several weeks/months on the site.."

20512,1736874,1,looky,19/01/2022,we arrived at around 5pm on January 17 but no more room. we were able to sleep in a parking lot not far away. another motorhome was with us.
20512,1735161,2,carlosll,16/01/2022,"If you are looking for tranquility then this is your place. They have a problem with the light sockets. The normal would be a scale between 220-230V, but I have been able to verify oscillations that barely reach 210V and even drop to 190V. This is very detrimental to your electrical consumables, especially if you have a trivalent refrigerator, as it can damage the plate. All this checked with a multimeter."
20512,1709645,3,FindusPettson,13/12/2021,"Actually a nice parking space, as described, but with 5 amps electricity, not even the refrigerator works in the winter. The main fuse blows all the time. There you can also be self-sufficient."
20512,1708144,5,audreycalys,11/12/2021,"The village died in this season but what a rest! Very good night. The gentleman welcomes you kindly. The wifi is available everywhere. The showers in the prefab are large, hot and clean. Right on the beach, wasteland to take the dog out just stuck (it would be good to pick up the poop even if it's a wasteland, we will end up not being able to avoid it) 14th all inclusive"
20512,1706397,4,sugary,08/12/2021,"We came across this place and ended up staying a week. Pretty good site, lovely staff, clean facilities and lovely hot showers lovely beach but the town is very quiet this time of year. O.k if that's what you want. Would return if in the area."
20512,1700042,4,jamesm633,29/11/2021,"Nice staff, nothing really open in the area in winter season but no fault of the site, who stay open. Next to a nice clean beach. Great cycling routes nearby. facilities are fine, could do with benches in the shower area's but everything is cleaned daily."
20512,1699620,3,fredetmaryno,28/11/2021,"A nice place but nothing more, 5 amps for 4 € suddenly the ALDE heaters in poverty because only 1 kilowatts otherwise it farts. The shops are almost all closed, on the other hand the managers are welcoming. I'm not sure I'll go back there, a bit sad at this time."
20512,1691090,4,marjonhauloglas,16/11/2021,"Do not be tempted to follow the navigation, you will be led over a cart track that a motorhome cannot pass. Just go through the town, on asphalt roads and be guided by the signs."
20512,1681804,4,SuitillosVan,07/11/2021,"On these dates just to spend the night since there is nothing in the town, but in summer it is very good, next to the beach. The price in November 10 € night AC two adults and two girls, it has a water connection every two plots and electricity equally."

20512,1654928,4,smeetjeee,21/10/2021,Clean facilities. A bit easy Made and older. Only 1 laundry machine was working so there was a line the whole day. Very short walk to the beach.
20512,1652381,3,hexle78,19/10/2021,"Clean toilets and showers. Washer and dryer. The lady at the reception prepared delicious sangria for us. ;-) Very close to the beach. It smelled bad at our place, so we didn't feel so comfortable."
20512,1651152,3,Machu,18/10/2021,"Small pitches and not all equipped with electricity, sanitary facilities in Algeco old-fashioned but clean. At that time everything is closed around, only the beach… the teutonic people, the blondes from the north, have taken possession of the place… it's teutonengrill… sunbathing… sunbathing… sunbathing…."

20512,1612649,5,andreasliebe,27/09/2021,"For us one of the best pitches in Spain. Nicely laid out, good sanitary facilities, washing machine, only 35m from the beach with its own access to the natural sandy beach with dunes behind. Skyscrapers only to the north, to the south only nature. Spar store with everything you need within walking distance, a pharmacy, a few open restaurants, but otherwise almost everything is closed over the winter. Coming for the 3rd time."
20512,1589196,5,jferfre,18/09/2021,"A great place to be near the sea. In September, it is important to call ahead. Motorhome prohibited in the outdoor area"

20512,1433850,5,RiRiRita,10/08/2021,We went in to change the water in the van for 5 euros and they let us take a shower. Very friendly treatment by the person in charge. Very clean campsite with good facilities.
20512,1398018,4,chispeantes,03/08/2021,Simple but pleasant campsite. little shade yet. € 20 in high season is fine. I flicker with people who complain in another comment that the owner has set up a pool and a soccer field. Is that really a bad thing? it is an improvement !! They have also added a small trampoline for the children.
20512,1360343,5,weekendvario,24/07/2021,Good paid area for campers. Big spots with trees on both sides. If you park in the middle of to campers you will have shadow both in the afternoon and morning. Water access between every spot. Electricity can be used with CEE plug and normal EURO-plug. 20EUR for 2 persons for 1 night. Showers and bathrooms were very clean.
20512,1318869,4,carthago27,12/07/2021,"Nice sea nearby not always very clean on weekends for the high traffic, too bad for 20 € per night. Go to the small Los Delfines restaurant next to the area, the salmon is to die for."

20512,1278642,3,pawsitive.dogz,26/06/2021,"Very well maintained, large showers with hot water (incl.), Direct access to the beach. A few meters further, the access with a ramp and footbridge to the water is much more pleasant in winter. In summer, and especially on weekends, it's like camping in the children's playground. Quite exhausting as a childless. But great for children."
20512,1273035,3,serge3292,23/06/2021,"Very disappointed, increase of € 6 in June. More and more caravans with very large and very noisy families. It's not really a CC area anymore. The owner even installed a small inflatable pool and a mini football field for the children. Very unfortunate because we spent great years there."

Tip: try to shower when others are not otherwise you run out of hot water. Everywhere was clean and tidy on site. Quite busy even though the town was completely closed apart from the Spar shop. Gravel track behind the site to the beach. Fabulous beach."

It is next to the beach It is clean and the staff is very nice, they are a charm The pitches are of different sizes, with little shade but you can take out awnings and chairs, so you enjoy being outside They have ice and beers cold, which always come in handy.

20512,954304,1,miquelrace,12/08/2020,"Those in charge are friendly and attentive, but it is an area with several “haimas” set up with many children shouting without anyone saying anything until after 00:00 hours, little respect for the rest of others. The electric current is only 5 Amp. We will not be back."
20512,881463,5,idanere,19/07/2020,Camper park a few meters from the beach. With very correct facilities and friendly and helpful staff. Nearby there are restaurants to order paella to take away. Recommended to be able to get an awning and tables near the beach in the middle of summer!

20512,803137,5,WhiteRastas,18/05/2020,"Shortly before Christmas 2019, we found this space via a parking space app. We actually only wanted to stay there for a few days, but it was a three-month stay. The longer you stay, the cheaper the daily price becomes. We only paid € 6 a day, including water and sewage. Electricity costs € 3 extra per day. Fresh water can be used in individual places. There is a floor inlet for disposal, as well as a chemical toilet disposal station. Containers have free showers, toilets and an opportunity to clean dishes. Washer and dryer are also available, which can be used with euro coins. In the back corner of the square, there is a large linen laundry area where you can hang your laundry. You can use free WiFi at the reception, but there are tables and chairs that are perfect during use. The parking spaces are spacious and parceled out on gravel. The course is equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay. In the place there is a very well-stocked savings, on the square a gas man regularly comes to the bottle sale. The sea can be reached in a few minutes on foot. You can hear it in the evening. Dogs are allowed on the pitch. Sorted rubbish can be disposed of free of charge. We lacked nothing on the pitch. Most of the guests there have been coming there for the winter for years, know each other and usually come together for games or small celebrations. We can only recommend this place and hope that we can spend the next winter there again."
20512,792268,5,carlosll,07/03/2020,"Good area at a good price next to the beach. € 8 plus € 3 for electricity (optional).

20512,653937,2,BERKUT,23/08/2019,"Good place for the location, but it is the closest thing to a third-party campsite, caravans, tents, noise until the early morning no bread or super service, street door open all night, positive baths and clean showers"

20512,610571,2,berthoh,08/08/2019,"It is a campsite with rest area services or a rest area with the rules of a campsite, you do. So if you are more than two, keep the surcharge in mind. Even hours of silence and circulation are a handicap for those who had not taken them into account. The surroundings are not memorable. Clean."

We will come back again without problem on occasion."
20512,432245,3,xaf,22/02/2019,"Simple, cheap area with good showers. It is located at the end of the village and a few steps from the beach. As many areas of the area is full of Germans, English and Dutch who spend long periods so it is sometimes difficult to find a place for traveling motorhomes.

Only problem the lack of space because the Germans and Dutch stay in long stay (it is not a criticism). so there are only 4 or 5 seats per day in Turn over. on the other hand outside there is a free parking that allows parking while waiting for a place.
20512,426394,5,ddehem,03/02/2019,"Very nice area, well equipped and at decreasing prices. For 3 or 4 days, 8 €, 3 € electricity. It is better to book because this area is often complete. Very welcome and, icing on the cake, in several languages."

20535,2806872,4,AWW91,31/05/2023,"You definitely need wedges to stand in the balance. The pitches are located directly on a street, so it can get louder when cars drive by faster than allowed. V/E nothing to complain about. Despite the road, we had a relatively quiet night."
20535,2802635,3,k4yah,30/05/2023,"Only 4 designated spaces. sloped. The drive there some of the bends are tight, cars drive fast and parking is right next to road . Fresh water and disposal but on a slope. Good bins for recycling. Wouldn’t rush back."
20535,2799561,4,Oquisell,29/05/2023,The toilet door is always closed.
20535,2797276,5,JuliaandRoberto,29/05/2023,Many options to park on flat lot after day campers have gone - enough room for everyone to enjoy nature and quiet nights with full services! Amazing.
20535,2794178,5,juniorbrazil,28/05/2023,"Very nice clean place a lot of tables , bbq , toilet, water and toilet cleaning there’s also a nice trekking around with caves"
20535,2782600,5,kanda,24/05/2023,"Wonderful, calm place to be in the woods. Almost flat designated parking for CC. Services working. Very quiet."
20535,2770045,5,MarenK.,21/05/2023,"We had a very quiet night here! However, it is probably a very popular place for families and friends for picnics and BBQs - voices and music could be heard until about 11pm. then only the owls ;-) there are five designated parking spaces for mobile homes, but there were also at least five or six more on the other parking spaces."
20535,2766437,5,lifeISlive,20/05/2023,Perfect place to stay for a few days with several facilities available for free. Also very quiet at night.
20535,2762084,5,tassietravelers,19/05/2023,A super place to stay. Peaceful and quiet. We woke to the sound of the birds. Great for an evening stroll in the forest as well.
20535,2738895,5,ewanjmackie,10/05/2023,"Great spot, very much recommend. Toilets are not open yet but that did not bother us."
20535,2723234,4,Travelcrazynl,04/05/2023,"extremely good spot, highly recommended.  2 nights max, so its not overflown with longstayers. Nice hikes around. bbq areas nearby , lots of locals. a lot of white campers unfortunately.."
20535,2692592,3,MrsThomas2u,24/04/2023,"Lovely woodland setting. Spent quiet night with 8 other vans/cars. We parked inside car park, although motorhome spaces are marked on outside, facing the road. Unfortunately the toilets, which were our main reason for coming here, were locked and cobwebbed so probably not been opened recently. Also the water tap has to be held on and is very leaky and slow."
20535,2687414,5,OldSquizzle,22/04/2023,"Thank you dear Spaniards, a place with rarity value. Good supply and disposal, shady and easily accessible as well as very clean! Of course, the locals are also looking for relaxation and fitness here - anyone who complains about this has probably not understood the purpose of camping trips. We had a good night's sleep with 6-8 others and a nice encounter. That's how it should be. Excellent!"
20535,2659552,5,RenaultMoncayo,10/04/2023,"The area is super good, with tables and to make a fire, there is also a children's playground area."
20535,2652910,5,Aitor-woloszyn,09/04/2023,"The place is very nice with picnic tables, also for barbecue, all the gray water and black water services and also to refill water and to sleep very well, only there is a street and at the time we were there many cars passed by but other than that very good place, highly recommended."
20535,2650065,1,missyontour,08/04/2023,"You can't imagine how bad this place is. I left the sewage there. Thank you to the community. The WoMo places are very close together. But the worst thing for me is that now that the weather is nice, everything is full of families, each of whom takes one of the many barbecue areas. It's like a festival and not for someone like me who likes quiet. I keep driving."
20535,2636291,5,robinreems,02/04/2023,good spot. we only had a picnic here. but i can imagine that this is a good place to sleep. in the low season already quite some camper vans. I'll remember this for next time i visit this area
20535,2628502,3,Waischno,28/03/2023,"It can get pretty crowded on weekends, when the grills are in constant use. services available. There is quite a lot of rubbish in the bushes, although there are a few rubbish bins. The night there was very quiet with some other campers."
20535,2627487,5,AlboGando,28/03/2023,"Amazing location outside San Sebastián to spend a couple of nights! Services working only low pressure water and the need to keep holding the button!
Definately recommend the location as well as bringing things for a barbecue! Nice fire stations :-)"

20535,2589426,5,joshua1998,24/02/2023,"Except for the fact that the space provided is just long enough for a VW bus to fit, it is very quiet there with very good supply and disposal options. The garbage cans were empty. Parking the mobile home is only possible across the car parking spaces and was also practiced that way."
20535,2584120,5,wilmarja,20/02/2023,"Busy with families during the weekend during the day (as in many places in Spain), quickly quiet in the evening and super quiet at night. Beautiful surroundings, many containers for separated waste, bbqs and picnic benches."
20535,2567332,4,bm.aroundtheworld2,03/02/2023,"Pretty little CC area, unfortunately the people are not very clean, and that can be seen with waste everywhere, not to mention those who leave their gray water open 10mt from the terminal which works very well! Respect these places if you want to continue enjoying them for free! Garbage cans available. Toilets currently closed. Good phone reception."
20535,2564797,5,kinnu,31/01/2023,"Very quiet night here! Beautiful surroundings, friendly locals"
20535,2545754,4,jagga,07/01/2023,"I stood here for 2 nights in the designated parking space, which is very narrow and small. Other campers stood across several car parking spaces. Water can be availed on the other side of the park. The park has several fixed barbecue areas for free use. The toilets were closed in January and the dumpsters hadn't been emptied for a long time."
20535,2530694,5,ROBY,28/12/2022,"Beautiful area. Not really dedicated parking spaces for recreational vehicles. Moderate traffic at this time, but water to services. However, the hut is closed. Many trash cans. Very clean."
20535,2522613,5,Alvor,16/12/2022,"Very nice in the middle of a natural area, picnic tables available and walking trails. In the Basque Country this is a quiet place (away from noisy roads) where you can get a good night's sleep! Services area with everything needed available. Very good;)"

20535,2495692,5,pinsmi,14/11/2022,"There are places outside the ""park"". We got inside in the extension of the dump area. It's quieter even if the road is not very busy. Toilets closed from Oct 16. It's better with wedges, but playable without. The restaurant ""Listorreta"" is very good. Service from 8 p.m. Free and very well designed dump area."
20535,2489628,4,karolinabertram,10/11/2022,Great place! Quiet with nice areas around
20535,2485420,4,elinewalaker,06/11/2022,"Stayed here a few weeks ago, stayed there for two nights. Was some people there during the day on sunday, it is a lot of tables and calm envitonment. There were no toilet available when i where there. Nice to place to stay overnight and drive in to San sebastian"

20535,2451426,5,mariem2612,19/10/2022,"Great car park in the middle of nature. Attention, no camper place, we have a 6m40 vehicle and were therefore obliged to take 2 places, askew. So if there are a lot of people it can be annoying. We stayed there for two nights. Free wastewater, black water and drinking water services. Very calm corner. Great."
20535,2449082,3,Frank209d,17/10/2022,"Nice location, good rest area with lots of shade. Only 2 official, narrow pitches for medium-sized motorhomes right on the road. Various mobile homes were parked across each of the 4 car spaces marked. Disrespectful! That might work in the off-season, but in the high season you're bound to have trouble with the locals using the place as a meeting place."
20535,2445333,5,Delphine3464,15/10/2022,"Super motorhome area with drinking water, nice view and departures for walks nearby. It takes about an hour by bike to reach San Sebastian."

20535,2368622,5,MarcoSteptoe,13/09/2022,"This is one of the very best Aires we have ever come across during extensive travels in Western Europe! The setting is the main 
thing. Shady trees, mountain views, a river nearby, peace and quiet. However, the facilities are also excellent. Not only recycling bins, grey and black waste water disposal and fresh water, but well maintained toilets too!
Cannot recommend this place highly enough!"
20535,2354821,5,LOU4SEE,09/09/2022,"Super quiet place in the countryside, very little traffic, lots of space, picnic tables and several barbecues, very clean toilets. Thank you to this municipality for offering us such a friendly and practical place."

20535,2325373,4,irenemcac,31/08/2022,"Wonderful area to rest at any time of the day. Highly recommended. The situation, in the middle of the forest, favors a very pleasant temperature, even in August. As against the passage of a road could be commented, but it is very small, with hardly any traffic. The sound of nature predominates more. In addition, trails depart from the same area."
20535,2324974,5,DebbieDelaere,31/08/2022,"Perfect nature spot for vans and campers. Free of charge, clean, kidsplaygound, you can dump toiletwater and waste. Picknickbenches and bbq available. Thanks to the city of providing this wounderfull place!"

20535,2298432,5,orfi,25/08/2022,A great quiet location in nature. All services are there. The rest area is clean. Only 20 minutes from downtown. In short ideal.
20535,2287413,5,medusavan,22/08/2022,"Good place, children's area, seats a little fair in size, as far as length is concerned, but nice and satisfying. It would need some light. Too bad that night there was a storm and we couldn't enjoy the place. Police surveillance on several occasions but everything correct does not stop."

20535,2230455,2,Luc1112,13/08/2022,"theoretically a 4 star place, but in mid-August it was very crowded by, among other things, inconsiderate campers who took 4 instead of a place because there were no campers left. The police drove by in the evening but did nothing, the next morning pictures were taken. Probably for the community as info, we suspect if the campers continue to behave like this, the place will be closed"
20535,2222100,3,Quentai13,12/08/2022,"Completely crowded parking lot. Should be early. Only has a small parking space available. Toilet, benches, barbecue areas and water available. Toilets ok."
20535,2218862,5,mickaelernault,11/08/2022,"everything is free ! family atmosphere ! gray water drain, drinking water, barbecue, children's games, toilets, water fountain only downside the lack of good manners of some who do not know how to park properly and who take the place of many."

20535,2199746,3,Africart,08/08/2022,"We were calm despite the fact that there were many people, until late at night vehicles arrived to spend the night. On the other hand, it has a number of services, dumpsters, bathrooms, sewage disposal and drinking water filling."
20535,2195855,4,Gzabi,08/08/2022,Very good for one night. Very full in the evening but there was still room. Very quiet at night and room to sit on the grass or picnic table. Dirty toilets in the evening but cleaned in the morning. Potable water. A good place. Better than a crowded campsite!
20535,2191820,5,LauraLeon,07/08/2022,"It's possibly the nicest, greenest place I've ever slept. We were almost 24 hours with our minivan. We had a barbecue in the afternoon and at the end of the evening it was night. It is very quiet at night. A beautiful place to spend several days there."
20535,2176869,5,TonvG,05/08/2022,"Free camper place for about 25 campers fifteen minutes outside San Sebastian in a wooded area. Daytime recreation for locals.

20535,2164590,3,nicowonto,02/08/2022,"We spent one night there. Lots of pitches, a few families enjoying barbecues during the day. The alarm clock was quite noisy, we were treated to 5 municipal workers armed with their brushcutter from 7am... a good hour to wake up... The site is therefore well maintained. The toilets were cleaned in the morning."
20535,2159784,4,Alexis.17,02/08/2022,"Plenty of seats. Pleasant setting, under the trees. Not far from a natural park a priori, with plenty of hiking trails all around. Free toilets, clean and practical. We went there on a Sunday evening. It must be a place where families meet on weekends. Because there were many parties (noisy until 10-11 p.m.) and people. But very quiet and pleasant the rest of the night."
20535,2159562,4,MiniCamperBE,02/08/2022,"Good atmosphere on the pitch and a safe feeling. Nothing for people who want to have their peace. Toilets available, were even open at night, I would visit again."

20535,2150241,5,LadyFletch,31/07/2022,"Excellent place to stay. Motorhome and toilet facilities available. Yes there were plenty of families with picnics, music etc, but it is their park and they were having a good time. One request please. If your van will fit into a parking space, please be respectful to the locals, and park in a parking bay and not across 3 bays lengthways which means the locals may not be able to park."
20535,2136711,4,bvq,28/07/2022,"Had a quiet night, but activities until midnight!"

Lots of places for vans, RV. Only downside, this place can be really noisy. A band put on electro music until late at night. It was a summer Saturday. Maybe a better weekday spot?"

20535,2093048,5,lebehere,19/07/2022,"best place for nature lovers. Beautiful area, everything you need is there, lots of space, lots of shade, seating, hiking trails, barbecue areas and a playground with table tennis. not recommended at the weekend, a lot of families with children ergo noisy and crowded, but after that you have a hard time resting"
20535,2084054,5,SeleneNou,17/07/2022,"Perfect place! The WC is closed around 11:30 p.m. and cleaned and opened at 9:30 a.m. During the day on weekends it is impossible, full of families. There are plenty of picnic tables and a children's area. There are drains and source for AC. We have been many vans and motorhomes. It is part of a Natural Park, let's respect the environment and appreciate this type of zones and areas :)"
20535,2079619,5,yoannCorleone,16/07/2022,"Perfect spot for one night. With WC and sorting bins! Gray and black water drainage possible, drinking and non-drinking water.

20535,2076540,4,PuxiCamper,15/07/2022,"Nice place, lots of green fields, a playground, barbecues, tables and benches. Large parking for motorhomes or large camper. The only thing that there were enough people to be Thursday, the weekend seems to be quite crowded as other comments say."
20535,2062537,5,AventurasRealLife,11/07/2022,Very nice and quiet to spend the night.
20535,2050707,5,Yeliso,08/07/2022,"There are several sites for Motorhomes, area for water, barbecues and tables, very quiet during the week, on weekends it is filled with cars for barbecues. There are local police, you can be there day and night. The road to get there is a bit narrow but fine."
20535,2038783,5,furgotina,04/07/2022,"Beautiful place to spend the day and to spend the night. Very quiet at night. There is a ping-pong table after the bathrooms, a barbecue area and numerous benches and tables to eat."
20535,2038020,5,dalvarez,04/07/2022,"Perfect area, we have spent the night here and we have to watch out on weekends since the people from the barbecues park in the area and get crowded, otherwise perfect the police often pass by."
20535,2031909,2,Rostoll,02/07/2022,the squares are occupied by cars that party in the barbecue area

20535,2028139,5,Purem,01/07/2022,Very quiet night with free services to fill up with water and drain. Perfect.
20535,2023528,5,momo99,30/06/2022,Great space for a quiet night. In the middle of nature with picnic benches and clean toilets.
20535,2023018,5,OliviandBen,30/06/2022,We loved this spot! Right on the edge of the natural park but also quite close to the city. Many of the spots were sloping but we really enjoyed the vibe here. Also the drinking water was particularly tasty!
20535,2011407,5,claudiaop,26/06/2022,"Very good site. Very calm. There are clean toilets, tables and barbecues. You can also find plugs."
20535,2001373,5,RosarioCosano,22/06/2022,All perfect. A magnificent place to spend the night. The only bad thing is that it is quite crowded.
20535,1997943,5,PascaleSaltersenB,21/06/2022,"There are 2 spots, but there is plenty of room for more. What a lovely area. I was able to have a good walk from here!!. In June it is quiet, I don't know how it is in the summer season."
20535,1996710,5,manix05,21/06/2022,"Area a little lost at the end of the road that climbs towards the natural park. Narrow road but it passes with a 7.20 meters. 18 km from San Sebastián. Free toilets and service area, very quiet at night."
20535,1991786,5,mirdiazto,19/06/2022,"The site is very nice. Quite busy but quiet, we slept wonderfully in the middle of the meadow. We will be back. You can have barbecues, and there is an open bathroom. recommendable"
20535,1984683,5,hansinto,17/06/2022,"Excellent place to spend the night, with waters and lots of nature"
20535,1972306,3,surroundedbydetails,13/06/2022,"Mixed feelings about this one! It’s great to have a spot that’s right in nature and offers free services. Also there is plenty of space for several vehicles, for both small and big. However, a lot of people during day time (evening it gets nice and quiet) specially on weekends. A really big bummer was the WC closing over night and the garden trimmer picking up work at 7 in the morning."
20535,1952434,4,notecolumpies,06/06/2022,"Cons: It is an asphalt parking lot and a little inclined. Pros: It is in a park with barbecues, swings and routes around it. The bathrooms are spotless but I think they open from mid May"
20535,1938599,4,llriviere,02/06/2022,"practical place 20 minutes from the center of San Sebastian, with clean toilets Enough space, no parking problems but be careful Mr. and Mrs. motorhome driver not to spread out too much."
20535,1927318,4,Cindyfp,29/05/2022,"Nice spot, we spent one night there. Only two parking lots and we had two motorhomes, vans occupied the parking lots and it didn't take long. The car park being almost empty, we parked the motorhomes in two car spaces. Many people party at this place so quite noisy at times but otherwise top, very pleasant environment."
20535,1926198,4,Carlssonmitdach,28/05/2022,"We arrived after midnight. Unfortunately, as there is no lighting, we could only find the toilet with a flashlight at first - it was locked but opened around 9am. We only ""found"" the supply/disposal in daylight and only then did we see that there were other places around the corner. At night (Friday) a few noisy cars and motorcycles, but tolerable."
20535,1924552,4,ronjawanderlust,28/05/2022,"Nice place, plenty of parking! A bit crooked though. Busy place, we went during the week and it was ok. :)"
20535,1919212,5,Delfin99,26/05/2022,Good facilities and enough parking space during off season
20535,1910603,5,celineamouyal,23/05/2022,A great spot that we highly recommend. Thank you to the authorities for giving us the opportunity to enjoy places like this completely free. We tried on a Sunday afternoon and luckily 1 CC place out of the 2 was available. Everything else was full and people everywhere. At 8:00 p.m. everyone left and the place was all to ourselves. 20 minutes from San Sebastian. top
20535,1910541,5,HaukeHein21,23/05/2022,Great pitch with delicious restaurant!
20535,1905540,1,Idolo,21/05/2022,Beautiful area - impossible weekend!!!!

20535,1904103,5,Slyou33,21/05/2022,"It was perfect for one night. Quiet, in the woods. Don't arrive too late to get a seat. 20 minutes from town."
20535,1898632,3,MATURANO,18/05/2022,"good for emptying and filling, on the other hand do not go there on weekends, no place for cc"
20535,1897705,4,CycyetRiri,18/05/2022,"We made a stop there to fill the water and empty the gray water, these 2 services work very well! Nice place to spend the night there as surely, there are large grassy areas, picnic tables and barbecues and it seems very quiet. The toilets were closed when we went."
20535,1891420,4,Enikrue,15/05/2022,Crowded on Sunday because everyone is enjoying the park. toilets closed
20535,1882337,5,Coline2A,10/05/2022,"A motorhome area as we would all like them! Large expanses of grass, barbecue, children's games, picnic tables, hiking trailhead, free gray water and black water emptying, free drinking water! Prefer the car park to the left of the street going up to be farther from traffic. Public toilets open only from June to September."
20535,1855647,4,chevris,27/04/2022,"quiet at this season, all services are working. Many hikes to do."
20535,1824211,5,xamascos,15/04/2022,"Very good place to spend the day or night, very popular on weekends, in summer there are public baths."
20535,1818983,4,julenmauro,13/04/2022,a great and quiet place. pity that there are no toilets in operation outside of summer
20535,1808288,5,Lhizsa,06/04/2022,"Great place, nice and quiet at night. It's probably busier here in the summer, with grills and fire pits. Toilet facility was closed."
20535,1803996,4,LuciaProppe,02/04/2022,"No toilet in winter, even though it was advertised. Very nice environment and easy to get to. Very quiet and some parking spaces slightly sloping. You feel safe among the other campers."
20535,1803126,5,myskay,01/04/2022,"Good for one night, or more. When the weather is nice, it is definitely very nice with fireplaces, hiking trails, etc. It only stormed for us, but it was quiet and good VE."
20535,1776006,4,nice2seeu,06/03/2022,Very nice site. Clean faucet with quick connector but with push button (you have to be holding the button to fill). Gray and black perfect. Only two spaces marked for ACs although we have been in winter and ACs and vans park in tourist spaces. In high season they tell us that during the day they fill up with cars and it is not possible to park there.
20535,1773559,5,juancgavilan,04/03/2022,It also has recycling containers of all kinds!
20535,1773556,5,juancgavilan,04/03/2022,"Spectacular place, free loading and unloading of water, a lot of forest, birds and walking trails, there is a house with a caretaker, he speaks only French but is very friendly, highly recommended place in nature!"
20535,1768151,3,gajettelaiv,27/02/2022,Lots of space but gets super busy on weekends.
20535,1768052,5,Sensationlibre,27/02/2022,"super corner very quiet, pleasant. drain water, 4g, barbecue, picnic table. perfect"
20535,1767240,4,Mssmaris,27/02/2022,"Please keep it clean! Amazing spot with services! Friday-Saturday quite day and night. Saturday during the day many family picknicks, quite at night. GDR drove by and waved. Please behave all, so we can keep this nice place."
20535,1762012,5,Manaxelo,21/02/2022,"Top ! Lets go inland. Has the very great merit of existing, in a geographical area where we are frankly unwelcome and where almost all the service areas are chargeable. Here, everything is free!!beautiful, very quiet nature area with barbecue, picnic tables and games for children. It's February and we're alone."
20535,1752766,4,trotaruNVos,11/02/2022,"Good place to spend the night and after breakfast go on a route around the area. Quiet even though it is next to the road, little traffic at night. During the day, especially on weekends, the influx is greater. Lots of picnic tables. Let's take care of this wonderful place."
20535,1740166,5,BeaKike,24/01/2022,"Very quiet place with all services available. In the middle of nature, routes start from there. Cars pass by the road at night, but it does not prevent sleep"
20535,1732216,5,Amigomoon,11/01/2022,"Peaceful wooded location , water taps still on for use in January."
20535,1721988,5,TimoBrockmann,01/01/2022,"We used the facilities here and everything was great: Black water, grey water and fresh water, as well as trash and glass. It’s a really nice area. We didn’t stay overnight but we were tempted. It was a sunny day and lots of families were sitting in the park here. Great spot!"
20535,1717690,4,GladJuvan,28/12/2021,"In fact there are all the services listed. The area seems really perfect but very isolated. we have just spent there absolutely nobody, we have changed the spot. shame."
20535,1711199,4,sanferan,17/12/2021,Good quiet place in the forest
20535,1707792,4,elultimovan,10/12/2021,"We were one night on the December bridge accompanied by 4 more motorhomes, very quiet, a pity that the services were not open, the road to get there with several speed bumps and dark. I would return yes or yes"
20535,1700934,5,NinJoe,30/11/2021,"Great place to stay. Very quiet. Service station available: fresh water, disposal of gray water and disposal of chemical toilet free of charge. Highly Recommended."
20535,1695938,5,alaitzo,22/11/2021,"Wonderful place, quiet in the fall. Picnic tables, grills, children's games, hiking ... Free motorhome parking and free services. Well a 10!"
20535,1694215,5,NatashaBOK,20/11/2021,Good spot but an even better option for staying overnight and away from the main road is the Errenteria parking place.
20535,1688903,5,bumblebussing,14/11/2021,Great stop. Good services. lovely hikes and walks all well signed. quiet in November.
20535,1679949,5,Ums1214,06/11/2021,"Great place, very quiet, clean and spacious. The services indicated are available except the toilets when we were there. We really recommend this place!"
20535,1660149,5,lostresmosqueterosenfurgo,24/10/2021,"A super familiar and quiet place, I definitely recommend it 100%. The ONLY detail is that the bathrooms are closed from October to June. The source of drinking water and the drainage of water is available."
20535,1634029,4,dtau,09/10/2021,"Very large facility, lots of parking spaces for cars, which of course can also be used for campers. Quiet, especially if you choose the side part."
20535,1619674,4,Georgiaish,01/10/2021,"A nice stop off, close to San Sebastian. Right within nature, with BBQs and picnic tables available. Very peaceful, only a few other vans from 9pm."
20535,1616933,4,MANUPippaChloe,29/09/2021,Very nice place for picnic walk and relaxation but for my taste still too isolated to spend the night there beautiful nature
20535,1607779,2,JC75,25/09/2021,"The setting is very beautiful, but the location of the area is not appropriate. In addition, there are only two seats and they are glued to the road. I'm not going to comment on the loading and unloading area, but it is clear that whoever designed it did not know anything about motorhomes or campers."
20535,1562146,3,EmielEefje,09/09/2021,"Only 3 stars for the area, beautiful and you can walk super. Sleeping was annoying and impossible. A group of people who were screaming and making a lot of noise until 2:30 am. There are only 2 camper spots and they are very close to each other. The 2 places were also occupied by 1 camper, transversely, very unfortunate. All in all, if you want a quiet night, not recommended!"
20535,1557436,4,THOMASFAM33460,07/09/2021,"We went there on Sunday September 5th. It is a place I think that allows many Spaniards to meet. We arrived quite late, around 6:30 p.m., we still had parking spaces. Very friendly, and from 9:30 p.m., the locals go home. Quiet night, in total darkness with the sound of birds! A delight. Free - public toilets"
20535,1554921,3,OctySept,07/09/2021,"Quiet and remote. But too dark, there is not even a light at night. We knew we had arrived by GPS"
20535,1554519,4,Fergussie,06/09/2021,"When we arrived it was night and we did not see the parking area well, it is also close to a road where many cars pass and it is a bit annoying. The surroundings of the park are very green and beautiful."
20535,1549946,5,nachule,05/09/2021,The picnic and parking area is very nice and familiar. the national park is definitely worth it.
20535,1540048,4,hponwheels,02/09/2021,"The site is good! and the services work correctly !! ATTENTION: the best problem is the one that is avoided !!! take your dogs TIED !!! What a mania with leaving them loose if they fight with others who are tied up !!! and please respect the silence so as not to disturb others, we had some neighbors in a van who thought they were alone, the desgra..dos !! for the rest good !!!"
20535,1533422,3,johnandjan,31/08/2021,"Not quite the quiet experience we expected as many children screaming until after dark then those in campers banging doors and up until after midnight not respecting others. The layout of the spaces is not very good either . Nice field surrounded by trees, restaurant nearby and disposal and water points"
20535,1513966,5,KangooroGZ,26/08/2021,Great place to spend the night and rest. Either to know the area or if you are en route. About 8 a.m. traffic in the area begins.
20535,1505201,5,familyroad,24/08/2021,"We love !! Quiet and very beautiful place with free barbecues, toilet, gray and black. the weekend is peta but at night we are alone."
20535,1501597,5,gemma18,23/08/2021,"A good place to spend the night and day. Green area, picnic, barbecue ... We parked our 7.40m motorhome without any problems. The seats next to the Bus area are wide and fit very well. At night all the cars leave and we were left with only the motorhomes and campers. Recommended"
20535,1478620,4,AnnCR,18/08/2021,"Perfect place to clean and empty waters. Good access, quiet and in a fantastic place in nature. There were several ACs but there is plenty of space."
20535,1475068,4,urik,18/08/2021,The place is correct. It has a picnic area next door and barbecues. Very close there is a restaurant where you can eat very well!
20535,1474846,5,EdgarCatalan,18/08/2021,An amazing place with a family atmosphere! Labavos open from Thursday to Sunday.
20535,1470100,5,xavitc,17/08/2021,Great. Tranquility and nature. There are 4 orienteering circuits and some very interesting caves. Although being a weekend there can be a lot of people in the evening everyone leaves and the place is great.
20535,1469924,5,Terrano,17/08/2021,"We were there one night and amazing. A very green space, with tables, toilets (closed from eight) and a lot of tranquility. Maybe there are people who are spending the day, but they don’t stay asleep and leave in the evening. All OK!"
20535,1440895,5,jlnavarro,11/08/2021,We spent 1 night. Absolute tranquility next to 6 AC more in the middle of nature
20535,1435625,5,annsoslvt,10/08/2021,"Very nice park in the middle of nowhere! We are not parked in the CC reserved spaces because it is too sloping, but a little further on, in large adapted spaces. Games for children, hiking trails, 15km from San Sebastián. Services OK, too bad the toilets are closed. Ideal for a quiet evening!"
20535,1429215,4,tulapower,09/08/2021,"Great place away from noise, lots of green area, possibility of hiking, small playground"
20535,1426729,1,Hunkpapa,09/08/2021,Be very careful with this area. Full of Sundays partying until the wee hours of the morning and at 7 in the morning a brigade cutting herbs with a scandal of beastly machines. I will not return.
20535,1426584,1,EvaPS,09/08/2021,Very nice and very crowded place for picnics. Too bad the loud music until 10pm of some users. Nor do I understand that if it is an authorized motorhome area they start to cut the grass at 7 in the morning right next to the vans and AC.
20535,1425524,5,Olfos,08/08/2021,"Perfect! Clean bathrooms ... all free ... I said, perfect."
20535,1421569,5,erayk,08/08/2021,"Excellent, free area and very nice. With picnic area and park for children. If we return to the area we will repeat"
20535,1412592,5,AASAE,06/08/2021,"Spectacular! the water loading and unloading area is behind the house, to the left of the road. Plenty of parking space. There is a playground, picnic tables and barbecues."
20535,1404647,4,clarajuanola,04/08/2021,An excellent place. There is plenty of parking. Drinking water. Barbecues Garbage Picnic tables. There are restrooms but they are only open in the evenings. In the morning nobody bothers. The boil is well cared for.
20535,1398458,5,Lianacas,03/08/2021,We had a wonderful night. Very quiet and beautiful place. Spectacular to go with children. We will repeat.
20535,1397478,4,Soaz68,03/08/2021,"Very nice place to spend the night, quiet and with all the amenities. Just the toilets are not accessible. BBQ available."
20535,1390209,5,patricharlie,01/08/2021,"Very good place to sleep, keep in mind that the toilets close at night."
20535,1383731,4,Orca_ma,30/07/2021,Very quiet area although with some slope. All services (except electricity) free. The squares in front of the emptying point are advisable
20535,1381027,5,Asu5711,30/07/2021,"We had a wonderfully quiet night in this great park with picnic tables, toilet, fresh water and sewage station. We like to use the table tennis table and play Frisbee on the large lawn. Great nature all around invites you to go hiking and mountain biking. We would definitely stay here again. Our 9 year old son also liked it very much."
20535,1377316,4,LiMi2021,29/07/2021,"Good place to sleep and linger. We stood in the car parking lots because the two WO spaces were occupied. There were also other campers about 10 there. It was very quiet at night, we stayed here twice. A star deduction, because cars come by in the morning and on the second day they locked the toilet."
20535,1353170,5,reclina,23/07/2021,Magnificent! Silent at night
20535,1350345,5,Rhornero,22/07/2021,Quiet and cool place at night.
20535,1323950,3,camper4487,14/07/2021,"Good place for a night, but incredibly crowded on weekends.
A lot of benches and a playground nearby.
When we arrived, the police told us that the two dedicated camping spots are only for large motorhomes, not small ones or vans and they don't want us to park there.
Toilets currently closed day and night."
20535,1312013,4,van-des-globes...trotteurs,10/07/2021,"Flat, shaded land where we spent a quiet night."
20535,1279630,4,rrrodriguezmanuel,27/06/2021,"The site is perfect but on Saturdays there are parties and music is not excessive, we have only seen two parking spaces for AC. The rest we have not been able to find."
20535,1253628,3,Raulus1980,13/06/2021,"Very nice area with bathroom, tables and barbecues. It has a gray and black discharge area and a water loading area. We have only seen two places marked for AC. There are several spaces where you can park long AC (7.40) as there is space behind and it is within the space defined for cars. The problem is that there are a lot of people during the day and it is difficult to find a place on the weekend."
20535,1227971,4,rea.seline,31/05/2021,"Nice place with alot of space for caravans and cars. Wastewater disposal, drinking water station and garbage station. One less star for the public toilets being only open between end of june and beginning of october.
Very beautiful wide open picnic area with lots of tables and barbequestations. A bit crowded during weekends, but the people were friendly and mindful."
20535,1180518,5,aussteiger1993,27/04/2021,Best .... quieter and in nature ..... thanks to the community
20535,1170216,4,MarkelGarciaLomas,08/04/2021,"Recommended site for AC, although the way to get there could be improved."
20535,1167436,2,tania22,04/04/2021,"We were spending the night from Wednesday to Thursday. There were cars parked in the motorhome area, so we had to park outside in the parking lot. We were here Varía and campers at about 11 am on Thursday, the municipal officers came and gave us 15 minutes to leave. That we couldn't be there, we told them that there were cars in the squares around here but they didn't care. They had called complaining"
20535,1162070,5,karbi,31/03/2021,Good place to sleep and spend the day. During the week very well. The weekend many people
20535,1160533,4,Josetxu.1,29/03/2021,"Very good place to spend the night and starting point for many hiking trails. Gray and black water loading and emptying area. Very quiet although very soon it fills up with cars and people. There are barbecues. Few places so please, let's think about the other motorhomes and park as well as possible. And let's keep the environment clean ... As if we had never been there"

Picnic area with barbecues that during the day (depending on who comes) is somewhat louder but at night it is very quiet. Excellent location, 15 min from San Sebastián and trails next door for walks in the countryside. There is an equestrian nearby, excellent treatment by them too. Highly recommended (at least in September and on weekdays)!"

Many snacks and barbecue areas. A very familiar and safe site. Every day the police go crazy to close the bathrooms and open them at 9 in the morning or so and at 12 at night. They also pass the maintenance of the environment. I recommend making the route from the restaurant that is at the top (following the straight road) to listorreta (path next to a river and through the caves) of the most beautiful routes I've done!"

Very good option to sleep near Donosti. For fuel, a good option is to go to a nearby Alcampo, it is much cheaper and buying something in the supermarket you still have a greater discount."
20535,626360,4,LudwigsOdyssey,14/08/2019,"Busy place in August but then again, there are not that many options in the area. Very quiet at night and good to have toilets. Need levelling blocks."

20535,587990,4,Robledal,31/07/2019,"Perfect place to spend the night near San Sebastián. Playground, picnic area, in the middle of nature. The only but is that it is full of people to make ""pilgrimages"" ... and if you delay in leaving, you will find all the crowd. At night very calm."

The price €6 for 5 hours is the maximum. With campers and vans we had no problems spending the night there. I don't know if you can stay with AC. The location is great, right next to the beach, a beach bar and there is a shower and toilet (the one on the beach)."
20602,2088076,2,AiTeee,18/07/2022,"Very close to the beach, it is a blue zone and you cannot enter with AC, so you do not have to take out things to cook, etc., not even in a camper."
20602,1933534,2,Minti2005,31/05/2022,"A little above at the roundabout there is another parking lot where mobile homes are tolerated, at least as an ancillary service. At the weekend there were about 15 vehicles without any problems. Unfortunately, dogs are not allowed on the entire beach of Pals and also on the path behind it, we were sent away very unfriendly by the police at the end of May in the morning at half past seven, the next time it would cost a fine of 400 €?"
20602,1857389,1,MeikeAssmus,28/04/2022,"Even in the low season no parking (even during the day) possible, although there were free parking spaces everywhere. After standing for 30 minutes, we were sent away in a friendly manner, but with the information that we had 5 minutes to drive away."
20602,1663561,1,Zora777,26/10/2021,"OK for going to the beach, but totally between the houses."
20602,1636160,5,smeetjeee,10/10/2021,"Really close to the beach. Free parking in October 2021. Toilet on the beach, just a few steps away."
20602,1513379,3,Luis_Tejera,26/08/2021,It is not suitable for small car parks. it is paid
20602,1451926,4,pandorayprome,13/08/2021,"Perfect for spending the night and watching the sunrise, you have a toilet and shower on the beach. At night there are many empty places, we went on a Tuesday in August. You have to put the ticket for the blue zone. We also had some noise from young people but they left early, higher up is the pine forest with a lot of room if you want to spend more days for free"
20602,1228647,3,IEKS,31/05/2021,"Nice as it is situated immediately at the beach, however they were renovating the parking lot. So not accessible at the moment."
20602,1200027,5,juanjograhu,15/05/2021,Fantastic out of season.
20602,1197305,5,dussel,14/05/2021,"Directly at the beach. Shower just in front of the parking area, quick access."
20602,1171839,5,Merycanto,11/04/2021,"Very good parking, on the seafront as seen in the photo that I have uploaded from the Renault van. Asphalt and flat floor. Out of season empty, we have been alone in April."
20602,1150192,5,JavierGonzalezH,11/03/2021,"We had a great time here, with the kids constantly playing at the beach. Almost deserted town now, people pass by for a walk, quiet. Supernice walk towards Begur. We stayed 3 nights, police passed by every day without any comments. No showers or water (we got water at a restaurant getting prepared to open). 
no campers above 3,5t allowed."
20602,201102,1,josecordoba,08/10/2017,"You can not enter. Many signs prohibiting the passage, not even parking at any time"
20602,130721,4,oiertxo,24/04/2017,"We have spent two nights in a row without any problems, without services but on the beach. The police goes round but does not say anything. Room to spare"
20602,123752,3,auszeitimwomo,23/03/2017,Parking between or next to apartments. Who likes it ... Overnight in low season possible. Beach very nice for long walks.
20602,122109,4,ondiamon,05/03/2017,Blue zone parking that does not work in low season. Without services and direct access to the beach
20602,117299,3,CaliforniaKid43,31/12/2016,"Very close to the beach, so perfect for a stroll, protected area, but on the prohibition panels specific to caravans, motorhomes and trucks, there are no specified dates for which we would be allowed to stay. We preferred to sleep in another place where we were sure to be welcome (for info: free parking in the winter Peratallada medieval village with sanitary and free wifi throughout the village)"
20602,113381,4,BreizhVAN,04/11/2016,Very very quiet out of season. Very nice.
20602,111970,4,Regza59,28/10/2016,Parking almost desert (28/10/16) accessible and on the beach! :-)
20602,106238,3,borres,19/09/2016,"The parking lot is quite messy, but very close there are two more quieter ones. September 2016"
20602,81141,4,albert080,12/07/2016,"The blue zone time is from 10:00 to 20:00 outside of that time, even in summer it can be unpaid. July and there is room for leftovers."
20602,69981,4,audreyphil,24/04/2016,"I confirm out of season no problem. We spent a quiet night, rocked by the sound of the waves."
20604,3290379,5,AdelinePlais,12/09/2023,"If you want to enjoy the city of Córdoba during the day and evening, the parking lot is perfect for that! No service but it's a secure place, don't listen to the bad comments, there is no steep slope, stop wanting flat ground at degrees ready!! 1 minute walk from the entrance to the city and 10 minutes from the mosque we hesitated when reading the comments but we don't regret it"
