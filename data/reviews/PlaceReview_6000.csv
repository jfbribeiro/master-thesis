76841,1519960,5,OctySept,27/08/2021,The best place in the world! Wondering to death
76841,1267387,5,drlago,20/06/2021,"There are mostly campers who have the pitch all year round. The atmosphere is good, the facilities are new and clean. In the plots there is clean water and electricity, it can be charged without having to move the ac. They are about 69 m2, and access depends on the plot. Be careful with the trees that ours of 3.10 could touch on a branch."
76843,2978462,2,dennisbert,17/07/2023,"The operator is friendly and helpful. There is direct access from the beach. The campsite is characterized by long-term campers and is very noisy. There are two sanitary buildings, neither of which are really clean. The sanitary building in the back, where there are a few places for mobile campers, is also very narrow. Unfortunately, we didn't find peace and relaxation here. Too expensive for that."
76843,2303550,3,bili3,26/08/2022,"€37 for one night (a van and 3 people). The location of the campsite is good, it has access to the beach. The plots are large and shaded. The toilets are a bit cramped and the cleanliness here could be improved. It also has a bar inside."
76843,2139573,4,ReneMartinez,29/07/2022,"Different spaces, one for the fixed all crowded, and others with grass for passers-by. Very quiet nights, dogs allowed, beach next door. Restaurant with fantastic daily menu and only €9.5, breakfast they have croissants. Spectacular. AC, 2 dogs, 2 people €27"
76843,1877547,4,Will40,08/05/2022,"Transition period at the beginning of May 2022 for 10 days with fitted van. Staff and management very kind and available. The location is very correct, shaded with the possibility of water and electricity nearby. The beach with access is 50 m away as well as the snack bar and the restaurant. A more regular cleaning of the toilets would be necessary. We will come back with pleasure"
76843,1776731,4,olivier300,07/03/2022,"Not easy to find an affordable campsite in this beautiful region of Galicia. Here I recommend, friendly welcome, clean sanitary facilities, fair price. A stone's throw from the beach."
76843,1544044,1,influenser,03/09/2021,"Camping to NOT REPEAT !!!! a lot of lack of cleaning I do not know at all respect the covid measures, since there was nowhere gel and the employee and the boss some cool edges the only good thing that it has and that is why I give it a star is the beach with crystal clear waters"
76843,1463712,2,mserr386,16/08/2021,"It is very well located, the treatment is correct and in a beautiful environment, but unfortunately covid measures do not exist, everyone without a mask, hydroalcoholic ice dispensers at the entrance of empty bathrooms, very dirty services, showers without hot water and with bagged drains, and very very noisy encamped people."
76843,1456328,1,xavi_er,14/08/2021,"Regrettable experience. Noisy, dirty and poorly prepared campsite. The area for vans and caravans is a muddy field, without any delimitation and with a very unpleasant profile of campers. Very overrated area of Galicia, dirty beaches and oversaturated by noisy bathers who are not used to what it really means to go camping and the respect that this entails. I do not recommend it."
76843,1391438,4,BioTheFirst,01/08/2021,"Campsite with direct access to the beach. Cool beach bar in the immediate vicinity. Great excursion possibilities. Shower with hot water, but relatively narrow, as well as the toilets. Wet cells are well maintained. Martin fell into the thorn bush while biking. So watch out for all bikers! ;-)"
76843,1006948,5,AnxoCamper,27/08/2020,"It's not bad at all. And next to the paradisiacal Isla de Arousa. Of course, you must be lucky to be able to get under the vine to have shade as was our case. For the rest, I would repeat without a doubt."
76843,968443,5,tonymelenas,16/08/2020,"Very well located, beach 50 meters away, correct and very clean showers and services. the restaurant menu 100% recommended and inexpensive. Summer 2020 a camper with 3 people and 2 dogs, € 27 per day with electricity. We will be back"
76844,3238889,5,guzmansantosm,30/08/2023,"Excellent place, it is a spacious campsite with all the services, right next to the beach. The bathrooms and showers are spotless, and the reception staff are very friendly."
76844,3224563,5,maxounet29,27/08/2023,"You certainly have to do some maneuvering to park there, but this campsite is on a human scale, very clean, and has a very friendly welcome. The proximity to the beach (50m) is a big advantage. We paid €38/day for 1 van for 2 adults and electricity (high season) I recommend!"
76844,3189571,5,MikeLeBlue,20/08/2023,"We spent 2 very pleasant nights in this small family campsite. Warm and friendly welcome. Pitches in the shade, quiet and 200m from the beach. Impeccable toilets. Very popular with locals all year round and good atmosphere. Reservation by phone before required Excellent restaurant 200m up I highly recommend. 39€ for a van, 2 adults and electricity"
76844,3141135,5,Pifolet,13/08/2023,"We have spent 3 nights and everything was great. Although it was full to the brim, as there are a minority of permanent campers, it is very calm. My children were able to go to sleep at 10:00 p.m. without a problem. The managers are wonderful. The only drawback is that the plots were not very flat but it can be solved with some wedges. Highly recommended."
76844,3094163,5,eyenara,07/08/2023,We stayed one night in the middle of the high season with the van and it was an experience of 10. The campsite was very quiet and the facilities were impeccable. The owners were very friendly and even recommended places to eat that were a total success. If we come back we will repeat for sure!
76844,2979774,4,luisa115,17/07/2023,"€32 pitch for 2 adults. Beach at 50 meters, clean. Mercadona hypermarket in Sanxenxo at 8 kilometres."
76844,2962292,5,Frederike3,14/07/2023,"5 star, very courteous owners, incredibly helpful, clean new sanitary facilities, 50m from the beach, baby bath, relatively cheap. Places are rather small, no toilet paper on the toilet, water for washing dishes lukewarm, no dryer. Small bar next door for bread service, breakfast, ice cream. Good starting point for Illa de Ons, Illa Cies, Pontevedra. wanted to stay 2 nights, turned into 6"
76844,2824384,5,Furgogemelier,05/06/2023,"Great camping 100% recommended, small, familiar and very well maintained with lots of shade, plots of good size, price according to the area (next to Montalvo beach) a luxury for the senses. The toilets are immaculate and new. Attention from the owners of 10. We have visited these facilities several times and everything is always ""super clean"" we will return to van it."
76844,2335942,5,eit026,03/09/2022,"We stayed on 08/29. We called to check availability and indicate that we would arrive at 23:00, and despite having the reception closed, they let us stay. The two girls who served us were very friendly and the facilities were very clean. The campsite is right next to the beach and you can hear the sea. With our 6.5m AC we had no problems maneuvering. We will repeat!"
76844,2061280,1,gemix2603,11/07/2022,"Small campsite, no toilet paper in the bathrooms, and little cleaning. We paid €30.80 per night with a van and two adults, too much for what the campsite is. The only thing that has the beach next to it, but I have been in better and cheaper campsites near beaches. I do not recommend it at all"
76844,1560551,4,Califurgo,08/09/2021,Family camping. Good size pitches. Extremely clean bathrooms. The only bad thing about the bathrooms is that the showers are small for showering and changing. The attention of the owners impeccable.
76844,1358248,5,JesMont,24/07/2021,"Exceptional site at the foot of a magnificent Atlantic beach with very clean waters. Very neat services, impeccable toilets, cafeteria, supermarkets and restaurants without having to take the car. We will repeat without a doubt because we are also close to very interesting places such as La Toja, Santiago among many others."
76844,938279,4,Elsacoal,08/08/2020,"Familiar, small but cozy. The bathrooms are new and impeccable. There are no barbecues, and the wifi only works near reception (neither Vodafone, nor Orange coverage). It was Friday and there was a lot of noise from young people, music and large bottles that were organized on the beach. We traveled with a camper car for two adults, the minimum price of the plot was € 28, we thought it was somewhat expensive, but we stayed."
76845,1026047,3,nfuentur,04/09/2020,"Good price, probably the cheapest in the area (2 adults + van = € 19, September). The rest ... fair; It's like taking a trip to a campsite from the '90s: very narrow streets, not suitable for AC and GV (with a rush of Traffic). Practically all of the places are occupied by fixed caravans. Few but clean bathrooms and many showers."
76846,3207138,5,tibu77,23/08/2023,"Family camping, very good treatment at reception. Small pool but it complies!! The beautiful and large beach is a 5-minute walk away. Plot with lots of shade and clean services."
76846,3111114,4,RopFamily29,09/08/2023,"Friendly welcome (the receptionist speaks French). Pitch at the top of the campsite with a view of the sea. Little shade. Lots of permanent campers. Swimming pool (provide bathing cap), football field, playground for children. Very clean toilets. Lots of life in this campsite. 5 min walk from a very wide beach."
76846,3100662,5,orome,08/08/2023,"Great campsite, we came for one or two nights, stayed 4... 2 adults and 1 van without electricity: €26.50 per night. There are several beaches nearby including a naturist one. The upper part where we are is very recent and very well organized. The water point on the site is a real plus. The boss, I presume, is French-speaking, which is also very pleasant."
76846,3045741,5,JorgeW123,30/07/2023,Very good camping and the treatment is wonderful.
76846,2290905,4,gusiluci,23/08/2022,"We were going for one night and we stayed for 3, a large plot for a van and an awning, super clean bathrooms, a supermarket in the campsite itself, with a swimming pool, a beach 2 minutes away. If I had to put a fault, the plot is next to the road and the wall is very low, so there is little privacy. Majestic staff. The last day they let us check out later than 12 at no cost."
76846,2239570,3,carmsteph,15/08/2022,"The campsite and its sanitary facilities are clean and the staff very friendly. The campsite is very steep and the pitches are small. We had great difficulty getting out of the campsite with our motorhome, a lot of cold sweats… the nearby beach is pretty."
76846,1463707,4,laureniki,16/08/2021,"Very good camping! Nice swimming pool and soccer field. Beach 5 minutes walk. Beautiful pedestrian path along the kid-friendly coastline 5 min walk too. Very kind boss. If possible, give priority to the completely new upper part of the campsite. Some places are very good, others difficult to park a large motorhome there. Little more, each place has a sink. Otherwise, clean sanitary facilities. Price: 2 adults, 2 children 6 and 8, camper van, around 43 / night, electricity included."
76846,358423,3,justy,29/08/2018,"Good camping regarding staff and facilities. not very enabled for motorhomes for downloads of grays, we had to raise a sewer in the middle of a street, but the rest well. I got the impression that the motorhomes are not well received there, not by the staff of the campsite, but by the campers there installed throughout the summer, which are 80% of the seats."
76846,314347,4,calibeach,04/08/2018,Good camping with pool and very friendly staff. direct exit to the beach montalvo.27 € / day van and 2 people (18/8/2017)
76847,2223421,2,LAXIENA,12/08/2022,"Although the deal was good, we went with an AC because some friends went with a store. It is not a campsite prepared for our ACs, so that later they say that you have to enter a campsite. Very small plots and paths, very bad services for ACs, we were very crowded with each other, a lot of lack of control, luckily we do not have claustrophobia... in short, it is much better in an Area or Parking."
76847,2189636,3,MaritxuNoraGoaz,07/08/2022,"The plots are very small and there is no hot water to wash dishes, clothes... There is also no hot water in the sinks for personal hygiene. Cleanliness was generally good, but toilet paper was missing every morning. For the rest, it has a swimming pool, laundry, supermarket, cafe... €35/night (2 people -€7.5 each-, van -€14- and electricity -€6-)."
76847,1518379,4,VeroyAlex,27/08/2021,Good stop. good access to drain water. lots of shade and an ideal campsite for the little ones. restaurant and super inside. very friendly staff
76847,1467967,4,MarinaRodriguez,16/08/2021,"Small family campsite ideal for children COVID security good, water and free filling supermarket and bar quite reasonable few pitches for AC a bathroom and showers a bit old but clean"
76847,1445893,1,ovies,12/08/2021,"Camping with very small and very crowded pitches, we spent the day outside and when we returned we had the pitch occupied. You don't have hot water for scrubbing and from 00 to 8 you don't have hot water for showering"
76847,1413785,3,partaxe,06/08/2021,"Close access to a beautiful beach, but very small plots and difficult to access for an AC or large Camper. Old facilities but very clean. It is not close to services or the town, but it has a very good family atmosphere. €32 per night without electricity for 2 adults and one child. Dogs do not pay."
76847,1383538,3,FerranMartorell,30/07/2021,"Very well located campsite, with magnificent white sand beaches, but EXPENSIVE for the prices that are usually paid in motorhome areas (37 euros for 1 night and 3 people)"
76847,1372645,3,cfl33,27/07/2021,"We only did the night. A busy campsite, the pitches tight and close together. Music until 11:30 p.m. It looks familiar. Many plots that seem to be all year round. Important unevenness in the campsite although the plots are very flat. Outdated but useful services."
76847,933558,3,jorh,06/08/2020,"Very nice staff, the salty pool I did not like, the bathrooms and showers very clean and cleaned often, very close to the beach, very uneven, I do not recommend it for motorhome, and Camper depends ... 20-7-20"
76847,663771,4,laikatita,28/08/2019,Attentive staff on arrival and during stay as well. Uneven park not suitable for motorhomes. Plots with enough space. Major beach a few meters. Good saltwater pool with plenty of sun loungers. Go-kart track at 300 meters. To visit Sanxenxo use the bus that also goes to O Grove. Fair price of 40 euros per night.
76847,565144,4,zaro,20/07/2019,"Camping very close to the beach. Plots with difficult access. Be careful, they do not have a chalk drain. Helpful staff. 1 child + 1 Adult + electricity and AC € 30 / night"
76847,294850,3,dbaley,20/07/2018,"Shade, cleanliness, accept dogs, prices correct for place very close to the beach (29 € for 2 adults, 1 cc), a pool, but the world (each his small plot)"
76848,1490872,5,and_13,21/08/2021,The camping is very good. It offers all the services for a very good price. € 17 a Camper and two people. The toilets and showers are very clean. Highly recommended.
76848,1460846,5,Saassi,15/08/2021,"We have been 5 days, despite not having space, the owner made a hole for us. And then to relatives who came to the same plot as well. It is a small and family campsite. There is a very good atmosphere. And the people who have been for the season treated us very well. It has a bar that is very good and nearby there is a beach in the hermitage of la lanzada that is very cool!"
76848,993107,5,vicentuco,22/08/2020,"We were passing through and in the campsites in the area they would not let us use the showers due to the COVID situation. In this campsite the manager, a very friendly man, complying with all the security measures, has taken our temperature when entering and has disinfected the showers before and after use. Warm water and everything very clean. It is advisable to go before 7 o'clock so as not to coincide with the rest of the users since some do not like our presence very much. Price € 3 per shower."
76848,933177,5,GraciFal,05/08/2020,"Camping near the beach where you can shower for € 3. The guy who attended us super friendly. Recommendation: If you want to shower, try to go before 7:00 p.m., we went at 9:30 p.m. and the boy told us to take a shower but that we will try to go earlier next time. Recommended 100%"
76848,652684,5,lock8stock,23/08/2019,"We pass by and you can take a shower for 3e person, very clean facilities and friendly staff"
76857,3238320,1,frant4,30/08/2023,"Expensive, crowded and fair attention, dirty bathrooms, the only good thing is the beach next door, I don't think I will return..."
76857,3166618,2,ToniGarcia,17/08/2023,"Overcrowded camping, too many people, they have put us in a newly expanded area without conditioning, it is not designed for motorhomes. The only good thing, swimming pool, animations and beach next door."
76857,3092922,2,chapiok,07/08/2023,"The surroundings are very nice, the campsite itself not too bad but very busy. And I don't know why the owners make a point of piling us up in a campervan on a grassy field with pseudo plots marked out on the ground. It must be better to keep warm :-) if you like peace and relative promiscuity, go your way… I wouldn't come back!"
76857,3036139,1,aketza,28/07/2023,"The attention of the campsite leaves much to be desired, there is hardly any hot water, the service in the supermarket is lousy, for a first class campsite it is quite bad, the only good thing is the beautiful beach next to it. We will not return or recommend it"
76857,3030466,1,jotabelatz,27/07/2023,"With moles on the ground, without grass or shade, inclined. Filled with clean water, it shares the water intake with the WC (disgusting), the WC is emptied into a sewer. They impose where and in what exact position you should place the van, even if the campsite is empty. They only let in after 12, so there is a queue. It is the ONLY campsite in which we have not spent the night after having entered"
76857,3010579,5,Anderetxu,23/07/2023,"Very good CP. Bar and minimarket. BBQ area. Numerous toilets and showers, at peak times you have to wait, but that's fine. It has a baby bath. Beach access. In the area of the wall there is little shade, but it is the quietest. Spacious plots with soft grass. Good to go with family. The downside is that the pool is very small, it is very crowded. How to go back!"
76857,2291560,5,angealvarezmen,23/08/2022,"Very spacious campsite, with supermarket, with access to the beach, bathrooms, grill, very complete. a stay of 10. We were 3 vans and they accommodated us in an appropriate plot to be together."
76857,2282087,2,wcristi,21/08/2022,very crowded and very noisy. poor animation and until almost midnight. very poor cafeteria services
76857,2274599,5,chinho19,20/08/2022,"camping of 10. the only negative the bar does not work very well, they take a long time to attend !!!!"
76857,2222421,3,Marie972,12/08/2022,"Family campsite therefore very noisy until late at night. Intimacy impossible, no separation between the plots. Big positive point: the toilets! They are cleaned almost all day so always clean. Plenty of showers and toilets so very practical. On the other hand, only 2 washing machines, one of which is out of service for a very large campsite."
76857,2139376,4,jotseca,29/07/2022,"Good family campsite with extensive services and showers, sports area, swings, swimming pool, bar and supermarket."
76857,2088491,4,Ruperta_S,18/07/2022,"In the middle of July busy camping, but they put us next to the bungalows in a quite lonely area although with little shade, they accept dogs in high season"
76857,1556854,1,MIBR,07/09/2021,We chose the campsite because of the activities they offered for children. We called before and they told us that they would do until September 5. Upon arrival they told us that since it was not a good day the animator would not come but the next day she would come. The next day he told us the same because it was only cloudy. It is not okay to trick people into making the last customers for September. It was pretty empty.
76857,1431860,4,inaki1981,10/08/2021,"Family campsite, with a fairly busy caravan area but a quieter one, next to the bungalows, at the end of the campsite, let's say. Direct access to beaches. Clean and smooth emptying and filling of water. Supermarket with few food items. Small but sufficient swimming pool, almost no camping in the Rías has."
76857,1379439,2,jordibaloomochi,29/07/2021,"Acceptable, very familiar and therefore VERY NOISY!"
76857,1255006,2,Aner,14/06/2021,"The campsite is fine, but be careful. The motorhomes enter fair and although the web says that they have ACSI, THEY DO NOT! We paid € 30 per night after they told us if they had it (the guy at the reception made up that he would give me 10% discount for the ACSI 30/34 card. The pool is small and screaming is allowed at night, I had to go out to attract attention at 0:30 at night."
76857,1124587,5,jlnavarro,27/12/2020,Camping familiar
76857,1005713,2,GureKabiya,27/08/2020,"The camping, the facilities and the staff are good. We have no complaints. An ideal place if you want to let the children go and not see them all day. For that same reason, it is very difficult to find tranquility. Until 12 at night a lot Noise of children (parents do not attract their attention, even if they get into your plot constantly), cars from here to there ..."
76857,924406,2,pamalama,03/08/2020,"Shaded campsite, clean bathrooms and good security and disinfection measures. Correct and helpful reception and cleaning staff. I left annoyed, although I understand the rule, that after spending a weekend with AC and spending more than € 100 and some friends renting a bungalow for 9 days, they make us pay the day to go out after 12 o'clock to eat with them in bungalow, leaving AC outside."
76857,895969,5,touch,25/07/2020,"Good camping, good facilities, good supermarket, nearby beach and common areas of 15 out of 10 2020 covid: little saturated in the new area of the campsite and continuous cleaning in common areas, long-stay campers very respectful with safety distances and capacity"
76857,879443,4,oscargd,19/07/2020,"Good facilities, pitches, swimming pool, bathrooms, .... everything collected and clean. Good option to come with children, enough activities. At 200 meters from the beach. To repeat"
76857,598244,5,fkaz,04/08/2019,"Nice campsite with super sanitary facilities. Washer and dryer for 5 euros per wash available. Sea is beautiful but a bit on foot. In August, no problem spontaneously get a seat."

76887,1884407,1,kanajo,11/05/2022,We turned back. Absolutely not a quiet spot in the middle of nature. Under a bridge . Busy road…

76887,1354033,4,mariefee,23/07/2021,"Great spot for one night, flock of sheep came around 10 a.m., but no problem. Unfortunately, the river does not look inviting for a swim."
76887,1332587,4,ValerieNox,17/07/2021,"Place in the middle of nature with a beautiful sunset. Lots of space to park and very quiet space. There are many flies, yes, but for the rest great. Be careful when accessing, that the entrance is small."
76887,1319402,4,Paaalolaaa,13/07/2021,"A very quiet place, we spent the night without problems. It depends on the season of the year, the green area can be flooded. There is a lot of free land, we went with our dog and he was entertaining."

76887,1015789,4,Fran631,30/08/2020,"Past early September, dry and pleasant. you have to move away from the bridge to be quiet, and not too close to the water ... to avoid in case of orange I think, and flood ..."
76887,866245,3,deborahmunz,13/07/2020,Would be a nice place. Unfortunately there is now a flock of sheep
76887,636745,4,Yann1980,17/08/2019,"Beautiful place, nice awakening with the sheep. The shepherd told me he came to sleep here from time to time. attention also to the vintage light yes, but in full summer little risk"
76887,586306,2,Marie_Do,30/07/2019,"Lots of flies and mosquitoes, and a smell of dirty water not very pleasant. Despite everything, very quiet and quiet, we were not disturbed."
76887,552662,2,ninid,14/07/2019,Frame that could be idyllic if it was not infected with flies and flying creatures in the first place The place is not very clean and the bridge just above qd MM quite noisy Damage
76887,468863,5,jpded,27/04/2019,"Great place (thank you Steff31), a good trail along the Ebro, lawns with trees, and lots of birds singing, the ideal wild camp!"
76887,440286,4,jtravel,16/03/2019,Right by the river but still inaccessible given the many branches deposited during floods so not really visible but very practical anyway.
76887,354905,2,Drey77,26/08/2018,"Pretty nice location at the edge of the water, and in the shade of the bridge. But I confess that, alone under this bridge, I did not feel at all reassured. Nice if you're not alone and scared"
76887,320252,4,FamilleV,07/08/2018,"Very good for a wild camping night: private and quiet, surrounded by trees. In summer, quite dry on the other hand ..."
76892,3255403,5,amaiikerSusam,03/09/2023,Great for sleeping and taking the ferry the next morning.
76892,3093813,2,GiselayPedro,07/08/2023,"You can spend the night without problem, spacious parking. To take into account a lot of noise from trucks that disembark and pass in front, noise from planes too. If you have to travel soon by ferry, it is a good option, but you don't get much rest due to the noise early in the morning."
76892,1303123,2,Xsarabel,07/07/2021,"We could not get in with a 6 meter Ducato, the curb is very high and there is an S at the entrance so the van would not turn"

76895,433018,4,Tighmara,24/02/2019,Go out of the car park on the track to the west. Quite reasonable unsurfaced road 500m down a great stop in the forest. For a walk another 1km takes you down to the beach
76895,425147,4,Runtrotters,27/01/2019,Quiet location but not at all covered by wind so if we like it blows at 40km / h difficult to sleep. Small village with no shops but only bars and restaurant and the view of the lighthouse is beautiful
76929,2950125,5,Quicolas,11/07/2023,Fantastic space to rest and watch life go by. Also for more prosaic things like having a barbecue or a romantic dinner. Totally slow. A wonderful surprise. cool

76929,270465,4,cfarkas,18/06/2018,"A little park just across the river from the village of Raposa. A
 pretty spot to spend a night. There really are storks and frogs, and the latter can be there really loud at night! There are toilets at the park but when we were there they weren't working (no water)."

76987,3172197,3,Hayar,18/08/2023,"The sunset views are incredible, there is a beach next door but it is not at all pretty, it is full of algae. Keep in mind that there is a cemetery and a campsite right next door. We have spent the night there without any problem but there was no more AC, just a lot of cars that I assume belong to the people from the campsite. There are some very clean public bathrooms next to the beach."
76987,3063355,5,Alonshow,02/08/2023,"Fairly quiet, with free and clean toilets (the beach was empty and no one had used them). Direct access to the beach and shade from some trees. Option to have a drink at the campsite. We were only 3 campers."

76987,2806523,4,LaGuinda,31/05/2023,The access road seems narrow but it passes perfectly. Absolute tranquility to sleep. There is a small beach with a lot of seaweed although it is very clean. It has impeccable services too. Perfect and calm.
76987,2573027,1,lesleyhouben,09/02/2023,The toilets are extremely dirty and I drove further.
76987,2390220,5,mirthevans,21/09/2022,Great place. Clean toilets that are cleaned every day.
76987,2364629,5,maulan64,12/09/2022,We parked there just to eat. Quiet and nice parking lot with a view of the bay. Picnic tables nearby. Possibility to spend a quiet night there.
76987,2239209,5,Txungonetero,14/08/2022,"Super quiet area to spend the night. Until 10:00 p.m. there was some music from the campsite next door, but then all silence, until 10:00 the next morning when the church bells rang. Highly recommended to take a dip before dinner, and spend the night."
76987,2189602,3,flesespark,07/08/2022,"there are toilets, there are tables, there is a beach bar (closed when we were there, one midday in August). restrooms and tables were clean. It served us to pause and eat. We wouldn't have slept there. the parking lot is big, when we went it was full. It has a beach next to it, although not very appealing."
76987,2023111,2,BFG_Bus,30/06/2022,"In itself a beautiful place and outside high season the use of 2 places is no problem. But, it is a noisy place in the evening and night. Also at night many cars that leave a little later ... Not recommended for overnight stay."
76987,1623706,4,Wiebsi,03/10/2021,It’s a nice spot for one night. We came on a rainy saturday night & the next morning the parking lot was filled with people visiting the cemetery.
76987,1527534,3,diegodeblas,29/08/2021,"We spent a quiet night, parked right under a tree. There were a lot of cars, but only our camper. We were able to shower at the campsite next door for € 5 per person (be careful, they only leave from 3pm to 7pm). I would repeat only if I have no other option."
76987,1290954,2,jennyjenn,02/07/2021,"Not great. I advise in case of an emergency night but not a great spot. The places are small, the beach a lot of seaweed so for swimming not great. Motorhomes I would say the places are not spacious enough but OK for a van."
76987,1155107,4,Pepster,21/03/2021,"Be careful, there are no places for motorhomes, in the middle of summer and occupying two car spaces, possible fine. Beautiful place ideal for outside high season. Very long cars, not recommended"
76987,693733,5,padraigl,16/09/2019,"This is a small marked carpark between the cemetery and the sea with some trees for shade. There is a railway track behind the cemetery which had some passing trains but did not bother us. The church bells also rang during the day. On the way in there is a campsite that had loud music until 1am Sunday morning.

There are no dedicated parking spaces for motorhomes. The carpark was very busy during the weekend as the bar and toilets were open at 4pm and people/families were using the small beach. The best time to arrive at weekends is late in the evening when most cars have left.
On Monday morning the carpark was full of fishermen. They all (about 30) were collecting shellfish from the shallow estuary. It was practically empty when we left at 4pm.

There are NO services. There are large bins outside the cemetery. The public toilets were open at the weekend and were very clean. There is a water tap outside the toilets but not sure if it's portable. There is a full body and foot shower at the back of the small beach. Picnic tables under trees are just beside the bar. The bar closed around 9pm not before we had a cold bottle of beer for €1.50.

At low tide the water is out a long way and you have to walk quite a bit for a swim but at high tide it's a lovely beach for a swim. Groups of canoeist enter the estuary here and paddle down stream.
The sun setting across the estuary is stunning. It's a great stop for couples and families."

76987,370386,4,romuald1969,11/09/2018,Attention parking place very popular with locals. Parking available for a motorhome of 7m from 20h. We spent the night without a sound facing the sea with two other motorhomes. The policia passed without telling us anything
76987,361207,4,AnaSky,01/09/2018,The parking lot is large and at night it was empty. It has toilets on the side and water intake. The beach is also next door but it is not dog friendly. The parking is pending and the most straight squares are next to the cemetery but an AC does not fit and you would have to leave it crossing several squares. Very good place to spend the night
76996,3156875,4,welcom26,16/08/2023,actually quiet quite sloping ground the car park on the other side is flatter but more difficult to access

For the night of 11 to 12/08/19, a dog barked without stopping making sleep impossible, people came around 23:30 and slammed the doors leaving the engine running.

Furthermore, the campsite is neat, good sanitary facilities and a nice reception. NB! If there is no space inside, there are a number of places in the parking lot that may be occupied by campers.

77079,2397582,4,Sigiscl,23/09/2022,"We were originally only going to stay one night, then it ended up being three. We are traveling in a mobile home approx. 7.20 m. There are several pitches here for the size. Very nice campsite, with new clean sanitary facilities. The lady at the reception is very helpful. Any time."
77079,2386970,4,tobinaha,19/09/2022,A beautiful location in a tourist stronghold. Space and sanitary facilities very clean. An additional vehicle (at least a bicycle) is recommended. Price per night 15.-€ / September.
77079,2318684,5,campophilio,29/08/2022,A super nice idyllic campsite

77079,2297543,4,normandyx,25/08/2022,"10 min by bike from Rosas and Empuriabrava. In the middle of a nature reserve but difficult access with donkey. Very good welcome, more places. 62€ 2 adults and 1 child, it stings.. Small swimming pool. Lots of dogs here..."
77079,2194297,4,Aroa90,07/08/2022,"We have spent one night in this campsite. We liked it a lot, especially that it is dog-friendly. However, the price of the plot seemed expensive to us."
77079,2192857,5,Delfngn,07/08/2022,just one night but perfect for landing with a van! shaded location and next to everything!
77079,2187634,3,LaRamonettadeBlan,06/08/2022,"We have been a week with our nasturtium in August. It is in a natural park, but little care. Lots of people, noisy, full of dust. Bathrooms clean but every corner smells like dog pee. The pitches have no shade and the pool is overcrowded and dirty. The beach is great, 5 min walk. Everything is organized for the French public."
77079,2103250,5,FrankLorenzen,21/07/2022,"We spent four nights in this nice facility. Our dogs felt particularly welcome there! Our pitch was at the very edge and bordered on a pony meadow. So we got a daily visit from a small pony, which got along great with our two dogs. Rabbits also hopped all over the site. But despite the many dogs, everything was totally relaxed. The dog beach section is about 15-20 minutes walk away. Otherwise the place has clean sanitary facilities, supermarket, bar, restaurant, pool, stage, animation and evening shows. Also a good choice for holidays with children! We also explored Empuriabrava and Roses on foot. However, if you are not good on foot, it is better to have a bike with you. Most dog-friendly campsite we have experienced so far"
77079,2077712,4,pacoherrero,15/07/2022,"Be careful if you come with a large motorhome, trees with branches and the maneuver to enter a square is very difficult, otherwise the campsite is great for our children and dog."
77079,2043351,4,Fahrbergs,06/07/2022,"Nice little campsite with some huge pitches on which there is an extra sun sail. Nice staff and there is a dog menu in the restaurant ❤. Beach is ok, unfortunately no dog beach in the immediate vicinity."
77079,2003419,5,lowlow,23/06/2022,"great campsite! dogs are really welcome! the boss is very nice and almost everyone speaks French! the pitches are good, and it's not far from the sea! but just a small negative point, it's 7 km on foot from Roses"
77079,1984172,4,MaVoCoe,17/06/2022,"This is a very nice campsite for people and dogs. The beach is about 300 meters away, but if you want to go to the dog beach, you should have a bike with you. The sanitary facilities are super clean and modern. However, if you bring a large WoMo or a long team, you will not have many options for choosing a place. (Narrow curves and high curbs)"
77079,1983773,4,MiriamBalija,16/06/2022,"We had a nice pitch with a canopy. The boss is very friendly, she was also accommodating when we returned the bikes we had borrowed later. The friendliness of the other employees, on the other hand, is not a matter of course and the pizza in the restaurant is a flop. The sanitary facilities are modern, unfortunately there was a smell from the drains in the showers. The beach is great!"
77079,1976765,5,Furiomini,14/06/2022,"Fair prices, very dog friendly (be preprared if you don't like dogs) and very helpful staff in reception. They organise different activities for kids, including various nature themed ones, visiting bird hides, visiting their small farm."
77079,1965698,5,NuggetKatie,10/06/2022,"Campsite right by the sea with its own pool/restaurant/supermarket. Sanitary facilities very large and very clean. Pitches large, flat and with shade. About 30 minutes walk to town along the beach and canal. Very nice employees. 19€ for campervan, electricity, 2 people and 1 baby."
77079,1923014,5,ht119,28/05/2022,"Excellent place out of season: quiet, clean sanitary facilities, well located (near the beach, cycle paths, 20 mins walk from the town). Pitches of different sizes with water bridge, all spacious, nice swimming pool, (reasonable prices) with take away meals. Paid Wi-Fi. Easy to drain gray water."
77079,1900448,5,coupechrist,19/05/2022,Superb campsite very well served and very welcoming. The very clean sanitary facilities as well as the paths in the campsite. We will return.
77079,1594075,4,iseult,20/09/2021,"Due to lack of space in the campsites closer to Roses we ended up here. Great, excellent sanitary facilities, warm welcome. Please note that all the proposed pitches are not accessible to 7.5m or more. I was not able to go to the first scheduled place. Roses and Ampuriabrava easily accessible by bicycle. We stayed 5 days instead of 2."
77079,1588641,5,Cenutriejos,18/09/2021,"We went for just one night and stayed for six. Marvelous. Spacious pitches, clean facilities and paradise for dogs and their owners. They have a canine menu and for us the paella is delicious. There is a dog beach 10 min walk with direct access. It is simply great and unbeatable."
77079,1586617,1,L159,17/09/2021,Neither sea view nor proximity! There are mobile homes near the beach. CP is crammed into the back of a stinking sheep pasture. 19 € / 2 pers. 1 camper for one night !!! Constant barking of dogs. Sanitary facilities very dirty and neglected!
77079,1465770,5,park4nightmariager,16/08/2021,"I recommend it! Very clean, well-kept pitches with shade, enough privacy between one and the other. The best, super dog-friendly and with direct access to the dog beach. We could not stay more than 3 days because there was no room. I recommend booking in advance as it is always full. Animation at night is appreciated, great fun! The worst thing is the pool, people do not respect COVID measures."
77079,1451877,5,pandorayprome,13/08/2021,"Perfect camping if you like dogs, there are many but they do not have a muzzle. we stayed one night because there was no more availability. But they told us we kicked you off the pitch but not from the campsite, and so it was, we spent two more days in the parking lot. We rent cheap bicycles to visit Empuriabrava"
77079,1349211,5,GKJJ,21/07/2021,"Very friendly welcome, family-friendly and good parking spaces, some with permanently installed awnings. Super clean sanitary facilities and helpful staff. Relatively noisy due to the animation, large pool and direct access to the sea. We paid € 40 per night for a motorhome, 2 adults and a child, including electricity and water."
77079,1343764,5,Polofern38,20/07/2021,"We stayed at this campsite from July 10th to 12th. The welcome is remarkable, the service provided is top notch. The cleanliness is impeccable and the layout is perfect. The welcome for dogs is exceptional with a beach reserved for them. Thank you for all these services, we will come back without hesitation. Without forgetting the management who greeted us in perfect French"
77079,1311203,5,Tierras_Insolitas,10/07/2021,"A campsite with very good services. Large pitches and 300m from the dog beach (there are a lot of dogs housed). They have a canine residence for € 10 / day. We did the laundry (€ 6 washing machine and € 4 dryer). The price was € 38 van and two adults (mid July, mid season)."
77079,1295093,5,lolallar,04/07/2021,"Excellent campsite close to the beach (100 m) and 300 m to the dog beach. A 10 in services. Good value for money. Excellent treatment. Free dogs, a detail. Well defined pitches, some with awnings and all for shade."
77079,1283879,5,Pepepoti,28/06/2021,"We went for one night and we stayed two because we loved the atmosphere, the area and the facilities. Large pitches, for our 7 meter AC without any problem. New and very clean facilities. All the services you may need (emptying, filling, bar, restaurant, swimming pool, entertainment, ... etc). They love pets and the nearby dog beach. We will be back without a doubt!"
77079,1054391,5,Saablama,17/09/2020,"Perfect for spending a night if you go with a dog, since the canine beach is 5 minutes away. Everything is new and clean. Also, the bathrooms and sinks are numerous because the campsite is large. You can choose a plot with or without shade. There is a grass soccer field and a dog park. What we did not like: the soil of the plot is full of herbs that stick easily to our dog, which has become very uncomfortable; We also did not like that in the adult price it does not include the price of the mandatory bracelet of one euro and the tourist tax of 0.5 euros. There is a super, restaurant, swimming pool and evening entertainment so the music was at full volume until 00h."
77079,1000354,5,txikicamper,25/08/2020,"After a week in the van, from parking to parking, we spent a very quiet and pleasant day resting. The campsite workers are very friendly, super nice. The bathrooms and showers are new and super clean all day. It is also the cheapest rate in the entire area, € 27 for a plot and € 4 per person."
77079,685841,5,condejm,11/09/2019,Very clean bathrooms and showers. Large shaded plots. Ideal to go with the dog. Animation throughout the day and a good show every night. Beach next to the campsite and the dogs 15 minutes walk. Good place !!
77079,675952,4,kira88,04/09/2019,"Nice campsite with direct access to the beach. Pets are allowed free, the pet beach is about 10-15min walk. We pay € 25 a night with services, electricity, emptying and filling. This is the 2nd night, € 23 (2 adults and 2 dogs)."

77079,646045,2,witch3k@wanadoo.fr,20/08/2019,"We had wanted to stay for two nights at this campsite but the rates in full seasons are too excessive 70 € for one night, 2 adults and 2 children, it is exaggerated. When the campsite is full, they offer pitches with electricity on their parking outside the campsite with access to all services inside for half price, only no shade and in the middle of the car park."
77079,621852,4,allanon,12/08/2019,"Close to the sea, nice pool, set in a large area, 1 minivan 3 people 38 €, all amenities included, parking in the car park (highly recommend)"
77079,559340,4,mathedidier,17/07/2019,"We stayed there 2 nights in early July and enjoyed. Note the free activity of a bike ride in the park accompanied by a bird watcher, great. On the other hand to flee from July 13 because the prices are exorbitant!"
77079,542371,5,guenabea,07/07/2019,Quiet and not expensive very well for a stay in Spain
77079,539163,4,ClaudiAlinaGregor,04/07/2019,"7,50m in length and just over 3m in height have just passed through the rather narrow paths between the trees with a little instinct. We had a place with a side canopy, which donated shade quite well. The toilets were good and clean. There is a restaurant as well as a mini market. The pool is nice, but cost extra and you are looking for shade in vain, bad if you have a baby. The beach can be reached in 5 minutes on foot. There is an evening program in the form of films or ""games"". The staff is, if it's finally your turn, friendly and helpful, but it can also take 5-10 minutes to be noticed, even though no one else is in the reception."
77079,506658,4,lajotte,07/06/2019,"Super nice campsite. Here we are. We had a fear of the pitches but our convoy a 7,50m CC plus a 2m motorcycle trailer all came back. Flat we could get off the bike without problem! Pool, sanitary a little outdated but functional. A supermarket, restaurant and qques animations without disturbance! The beach is 200m. Reasonable prices! Degressive long stay from a week and -10% for more than 60 years !! Receptionist speaks several languages ... I recommend"

77086,3245842,3,Elemaro,01/09/2023,"We stopped to eat. The picnic area with benches and tables is just past the bridge, in front of the soccer field. It has trash cans. Good to eat."

77086,1386805,1,crisms03,31/07/2021,"We arrived at dawn, so I don't know if it's beautiful and worthwhile during the day, but I don't recommend it to sleep on the weekend. We arrived on a Friday morning and there was a large bottle. Dozens of cars with the lights on because it is all very dark and lots of kids drinking and making a fuss."
77086,1384111,1,Mayor_k,30/07/2021,It smells like dog excrement all over it !!
77086,1339448,4,Mescal,19/07/2021,"Remote and quiet area, the highway can be heard in the background, but you sleep very well. We slept in hammocks and nobody bothered us, although at first we were not very convinced, (we arrived at night and there are no streetlights) it was a good decision. In the town there is a churrería, La Traviesa, very good for breakfast."
77086,1263478,4,psviteri,19/06/2021,"Perfect for a stop along the way. We slept with another coach without problems. Quiet place very close to the A3, but far enough away."
77086,1064358,3,Buracona,22/09/2020,"It is better the part in front (crossing the bridge) where you do have shade and there are the picnic tables (by covid sealed) but you take out your chairs, table and eat. I did not see a plate forbidden to stay overnight."
77086,1037952,4,lau_lm,10/09/2020,"Site next to the river with a lot of shade, very good to make a stop to eat (we have not stayed overnight). There are picnic tables, although we have found them sealed. Nothing open around."

77086,874472,4,juansaussol,17/07/2020,A good place to spend the night listening to the Tagus River. with a path that takes you to the town and to the castle

77086,623775,4,elixabetege,13/08/2019,"A good place to sleep, but without services. It is a joy to see the river in the morning and there are trees, the area is quiet and beautiful. In the morning there is some movement, as there are leisure facilities next door (swimming pool, paddle tennis, canoeing club ...). Lonely place at night."
77086,485050,4,hansthevan,15/05/2019,"Nice place!  We stopped here to work online, good 4g and beautiful surroundings. You can swim but watch out for the current! nice running routes too."
77086,426122,3,Juju70,02/02/2019,Scrap of group either side of a small river. Large number of cars whizzing in and out for a nowhere place. Ok for an overnighter as nothing else around.

77086,339136,4,Capora,17/08/2018,"We have spent one night and the truth is that it is very quiet. Maybe it has a little less traffic than the opposite site, from what we have been able to appreciate."
77106,1856220,4,thsmnz,27/04/2022,We arrived at 11pm and it was the only place I was able to find to spend the night. It’s a bit noisy because there’s a big avenue in front. In the next day the van kept there and I had no issues. The only problem for me is the noise during the night and other cars parking really next to the van blocking the door opening.
77106,1727268,5,MartaJaner,05/01/2022,We have left the motorhome parked during the day. We had tried unsuccessfully to park closer to the center but it was impossible. Good combination by bus to the center. We decided not to sleep here since when passing the road by the side you can hear a lot of traffic.
77109,3289242,1,MARTIGIMENEZ,12/09/2023,"It is a blue zone parking lot, right next to it is the Albarracín motorhome area, so, paying for paying, we decided to have the services of filling, emptying water, electricity, Wi-Fi, washing machine and the security of being in a closed area"

77109,2653744,4,Coonan,09/04/2023,Level carpark where you can hike amongst the rocks or walk to the town. We chose this place instead of the higher one which is further out because of the wind - we have a pop top. Half the vans here were tourists and half were young boulderers in groups but it was quiet from 11.30 till 8. Easter Saturday so quite full.
77109,2640183,4,3decamper,04/04/2023,"Quiet night, next door they are finishing a camper area with services. Many campers and AC, right next to the Mar Nummus headquarters of Dinopolis."
77109,2618741,3,ElVeterano,21/03/2023,"We parked in the town in the big car park next to main street for the day to visit the town. We considered the town even nicer than Cuenca. Parking at night by the Dinosauro was fine and quiet, there were 3 camper vans there and then 3 young travellers turned up in their vans. No problems at all. However the new aire that is being built will probably close this area to us."

77109,2429966,1,Nippers,08/10/2022,For the first time that I arrive I stop at this place and it has happened to me that they have arrived like 7 or 8 campers at 12 at night as if they were alone in the parking lot...: I don't understand this anymore... I have always seen that this world had respect towards the others for tonight is incredible.

77109,1952649,4,fred.voyage,06/06/2022,"As good as before, very quiet night, during the day from time to time a car or hiker. A short walk to the tourist information and from there you can then explore the place. It is also nice to start hiking from this parking lot."
77109,1919883,3,EvaOchoa,27/05/2022,"Super quiet place to sleep, it is a paved and level parking lot. It's nice to wake up to the song of the birds. No service because it is not an area but it is worth it since Albarracín does not allow overnight stays."
77109,1822456,3,casot,14/04/2022,Paved parking without slopes. The marked car parks are for automobiles but all types of motorhomes can stay overnight. They can fit about 15-20 depending on the length of the vehicle 500 m from the town. No services near hiking trail. Very calm

77109,1627510,5,Myrijor,05/10/2021,"Great and quiet place, it really is not the Dinopolis parking lot as it says in the comments, the Dinopolis parking is a little further down and that is private. It is the municipal sports hall parking. It is one kilometer from the center of Albarracin so you can go for a walk without problem. Motorhomes are not prohibited and it is free."

You can go a little further along the paved area. following this unpaved road, there is a descent to the ""coves"".

With the van (6m) it just fitted, the employee at the parking lot said it wouldn't be a problem if the car protruded slightly beyond the parking space. 20-25 min walk through downtown to the cable car.

77267,2786320,3,Vincia,25/05/2023,Dirty because full of waste and glasses on the floor but it helps out for the night. There is a lot of space and you have a view of the lit city. There were young people who had put on some music but we got on the other side and it didn't bother us too much. We were the only campers.

77267,2583340,4,MaxiSole,19/02/2023,"Located on the street opposite the hacienda, there is a quiet parking space for 4-5 mobile homes. Drinking water can be found in the park. Playground and tennis and soccer field nearby are not disturbing. There is a relatively large amount of garbage, so the place loses a point. Lots of glass higher up in the trees, the site itself has great views over the town."

It has a lot of shade and with open windows it gives off the good current that is appreciated in this heat wave, that is a plus point. gorgeous sunset"
77267,1686183,2,Croxy94,12/11/2021,"Frankly not one of the best places we tested but there weren't a lot of other options around Seville. You have to actually push past the waste but the place is not incredible: close to the road, the park is not pleasant and there is a shooting range right next to it. We only spent the night there so that was enough."
77267,1674998,3,blaiseetvero,02/11/2021,Lots of places and shade. Easy to find where to lay flat. Be careful if you have dogs because the ground is littered with broken glass. Nice views and hassle-free access with a PL. Quiet night and gentle awakening.

77267,1537387,4,ofeliz,01/09/2021,"It's a vast park with plenty of trees and shadow. There's no services but it's very calm. I stayed there for 2 nights, you can easily find places that are not as dirty as the pictures. Very few people passing by, the road is far so there's no noise. 30 minutes from Sevilla. Shadow and fresh air in the evening and in the morning until 11am = a blessing in Andalucía! I recommend."
77267,1500862,5,fabtack,23/08/2021,"Waste yes, but so much space you can find a location without. not enough to make a fuss out of it. The place is superb, in the middle of the pines and in front of the illuminated city. we see the moon rise behind a building. Magnificent. totally calm, peaceful, rather safe place even if we were alone in the world. I recommend 100%. accessible all vehicles."

77267,1260082,5,Val12200,17/06/2021,Ideal place for those like me looking for a quiet corner in the middle of nature. I recommend the small grove in front of the Oromana hacienda.

Admittedly some rubbish and bits of glass, it is enough simply not to park on it ... Many spaces are without waste. On the outskirts of a big city, this place remains a godsend."

There’s a cute local bar just within walking distance 5 mins. And there’s fresh water at the children’s playground near the bar. Yes there’s a tiny bit of litter but nothing offensive, great town as well. Spend a bit of money at the bar or supermarket as a way of thank you."
77267,1132739,1,einsamezecke,24/01/2021,"It is quiet and there is shade, but for my taste it is a horrible place because of the large amount of garbage and glass. I am ashamed that someone comes and see what we can do with beautiful surroundings."

There is more than enough space and even shade. which is quite rare in Andalusia. Two totally peaceful nights when I got kicked out of the mill site where I was just before"
77267,509954,5,oudeska,09/06/2019,Surprisingly good. We just didn't expect that much traffic there but otherwise it's perfect.
77267,422306,1,pirate.riot,13/01/2019,Worse than expected. This is not a meadow but a pure garbage dump. over all glass bottles and dumped garbage. But that seems to be normal in Andalusia. really sad.
77267,401769,4,Martine95,31/10/2018,"In case of rain, do not continue along the road (do not go down after the hill) and it is very muddy and slippery. Impossible to trace without 4x4 and also impossible to continue. We needed a tractor to pull us up the hill."

77267,319340,1,kcolaq,07/08/2018,"Very nice view of the city at night, but the site is filled with garbage cans, broken glass bottles and condom wrappers. We were disturbed all night by the sounds of the farm next door (cries of ass, barking, roosters ...) and we were greeted on waking by gunshots given in a shooting range next door . I advise against"

Facing the sea. A gray sand beach and further on a small ancient archaeological site (2 € entry) and a magnificent pebble beach. We spent the day and one night there.

When it is 1 or 2 no problems, when there are more or vans take up 2 or even 3 parking spaces the policía local will move everyone on, so be considerate. Longer vans can park alongside the wall side.

77279,623147,4,crisalay,13/08/2019,We have spent a quiet night with 5 or 6 more vans. Nice views and good place to get away from the coast movement.
77279,621682,4,bohallien,12/08/2019,"Nice place with great views. By cons, there was more space arriving yesterday at 22:30. Pity..."
77279,602153,4,Eukene,05/08/2019,"Spectacular views and very quiet place. There are no services, but containers are nearby."
77279,480987,5,Jekyll.Hyde,10/05/2019,"Very nice Spot. We spend one night there. A few hikers will show up from time to, or some farmers. The night was totally calm and peaceful. We were the only ones. The next day we enjoyed a nice hike to the top of the mountain and had a stunning view over the bay. Simply perfect."
77279,459486,5,Robert999,19/04/2019,"Class place, we were four nights on site, nice farmers who drive the cattle on the pasture. Rural atmosphere, sometimes quite loud by the animals directly at the car. Great view."
77279,454285,5,NadineTankian,14/04/2019,"Beautiful, quiet place in nature. Very little space, we stood one night with 2 other vans. Not suitable for campers."
77279,449510,3,robrom,05/04/2019,A bit windy
77279,444764,4,L.Sim,25/03/2019,"Great, terrific place with a fantastic view. Pretty steep, that is not optimal for the night. In addition, close to the village and with free-running horses and cows, that is very idyllic, but should not be overstressed."
77279,441009,4,oliviernicolet,17/03/2019,"Superb small parking used by climbers, not at all a place for camper."
77279,411484,4,luislopez,02/12/2018,Magnificent place to spend the night we went for one night and impossible not to have another night more. the views of the strait are impressive and seeing the sunrise from the van was an experience also say that the second day we found a window of a broken car but in 10 years that I have been going there to climb I had never seen a problem
77279,394450,5,koala96,16/10/2018,Very beautiful view! Directions about 2km a bit bumpy and some narrow streets (if a car comes to meet) ...
77279,300774,5,Ibiltariak,25/07/2018,"Super quiet and good views, but about 8 o'clock in the morning a guard has come to warn us that you can not stay overnight, that if we spent one more night he would fine us."
77279,275934,5,rubendario18,27/06/2018,Very good. No problem to spend the night. There are three flat places and others not so much. Much tranquility. Good place to walk and take a walk. Nearby are the anthropomorphic Betis tombs.
77279,265294,4,vinc.meye,08/06/2018,Nice spot to stay for a night. Thanks for sharing!
77283,2866041,5,Polux64,18/06/2023,"Super campsite near the beach, off-season bike rides possible on the various paséos (+10 km). very clean. Only point to improve the corner of washing dishes, to modernize. Great little restaurant in a parallel street near the seafront 5oo m away ""Pas de Mar"" €14 menu del dia all inclusive 3 courses + dessert wine and bread, it changes every day super nice. I recommend"
