26367,3192080,4,Israman,21/08/2023,"Good place, quiet and well located to visit the town taking a 5-minute walk. We slept the night of 8/17 with 5 other ACs very calmly. It has no services."

26367,2932524,5,ManonEnSoofie,07/07/2023,Parking super close to the city with a beautiful view. At night it’s very quite. Big flat parking with lots of space. Close to a beautiful look out in the middle of nature and ancient castle (walk to the very end of the harbor and take a stair (on your right hand) up surrounded by white fences. Continue up past the parking and take a left. You will be amazed!) Weekly market is on Saturdays.

26367,2700773,3,SimonF15,27/04/2023,"There is nothing wrong with this site as such! It’s flat, lots of room. The elephant in the corner is the road. It’s cobbled so any vehicle passing makes a huge noise. We parked and ate supper then decided to move on when the local youth did the drive by tooting thing (sounding their horn repeatedly!) We moved ten miles further and slept the night with a beautiful (quiet) view."

26367,2407616,5,gapa61,27/09/2022,"Deserved 5 stars. What's the point? It's a free place with great views in a city. If you complained about noise here, you couldn't help it. Camping would be better then. We enjoyed our stay here and thank you for the opportunity to stay officially and for free."
26367,2331231,4,Didacanis,02/09/2022,"We didn't find it to be as bad a place as some say. Good views, close to the town and the beach. It is true that it is right next to the road, but it dies at the end of the port, the traffic at night is not so exaggerated. It is a free parking lot where we are allowed to sleep, there is no need to be so demanding."
26367,2323357,2,erramonet,31/08/2022,"If it weren't for the views, the place isn't worth it. We decided not to spend the night there because the cars pass by making a lot of noise. Good for large ACs"
26367,2313553,1,larguito,28/08/2022,"Parking area near the center. I do not advise spending the night, many cars pass by and the street is made of cobblestones. When the cars go by at night, they look like planes taking off."

26367,1888979,5,Taifa,14/05/2022,Attention: Ignore directions on the maps because you will end up stuck in the streets of the old town because it really tries to take you to a viewpoint that is over the parking lot... the parking lot is very good except for noise from the pavement.

26367,115797,4,dontpanic,10/12/2016,"It's ok to visit the village, near the centre, along the seaside promenade. Top spend the night, not so much; might seem quiet but the cobblestones make every car passing by extremely loud. Perhaps on a weekday in low season it's ok, I arrived at the weekend and wouldn't advise spending the night here"
26367,93502,4,capitaniglo,12/08/2016,"Good place to sleep and visit Cedeira, to buy, tapas or go shopping. It has three parking lots in a row where it is easy to find a place. It's true what I've read around here. the noise of the cars passing through the cobblestone is heard."

No services of any kind. Quiet to sleep."
26384,3153674,4,corradocerullo,15/08/2023,"Perfect parking to stop and / or sleep. A few steps from the village. There are few places and being a car park it is useful to use it as such by occupying only one space (also to give the possibility to park more campers and vans, given the shortage of places around the town). Pay the ticket (mandatory) at the automatic cash machine for €10 (it only accepts coins); pass the controller."
26384,3135944,5,JotaRoman,13/08/2023,"Place with little traffic at night. The price of parking is €10 for 24 hours, staying overnight is allowed, parking hours are from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., to spend the night it is not necessary to pay."

26384,2453032,5,cpcp,20/10/2022,Free in the low season and yes there’s a height limit on the car park but not on the longer and wider spaces slightly further down (so basically the car park is height limited but the camper area isn’t).

It is worth arriving at the last minute to spend the night and the next day to spend the day visiting the town. Anyway they charge parking where you park. The zoo if you travel with children is very good
26384,1192774,4,gjplaisier,11/05/2021,"We have spent a wonderful night here. The parking lot is now arranged in such a way that only passenger cars can park. But next to the bus parking lot is also a lot of space to park and that is allowed. The only downside is that 12 houses are being built next to the parking lot and that you will be woken up by the workers early in the morning. No facilities, but a very quiet night."

26458,2470229,1,Golonko,30/10/2022,"in October you pay €10. Years ago out of season was not paid. A pity, we will not return. No service and they should make it easy for us to move out of season."
26458,1776404,1,KKF,07/03/2022,"It's a shame they go so far with prices. We planned to spend several days in the town, but we passed by. There are places as beautiful as this where we are received better."

26458,1636922,2,Elana200,10/10/2021,"Choose well the day you stay. The tranquility of the place depends on the time of year and if the beach bars are open. The situation is fantastic but without services. It is forbidden to take out chairs, etc."
26458,1597448,4,nhernandez,21/09/2021,"Guarded parking. € 18 / night, without services and you cannot remove an awning or chairs but a very good location to go to the beach and also in the center itself to go to dinner and lunch in the town, which is very worth it. We did not stay at the campsite or park them later because they would be caught too far from the town."
26458,1568862,2,MartayNacho,11/09/2021,"Ugly and expensive parking but well located. No views. € 18 per day. A lot of pedestrian crossing and music from the nearby gambling dens, but you can sleep peacefully at night. The problem is that in Zahara there is not much option. It is worth visiting and having lunch / dinner in the village."
26458,1510778,1,Iloro,25/08/2021,"Keep in mind that you spend the night in Zahara, especially if it is Friday or Saturday because that parking lot becomes a macro-party with music and a bottle until 9 in the morning as was our case. It is still a parking lot with no service, just sleep, if they let you. € 18. On the other hand, Zahara is beautiful and the parking is right in front of the beach and 2 minutes from the center."
26458,1500832,4,JordiLlaveria,23/08/2021,"One of the few places to park in Zahara, on the very first line of the beach, and we have spent a good night are party noises or large bottles. The price for the 24 hours is 18 euros and no service is offered and nothing can be taken out of the camping motorhome."
26458,1455313,3,lonsogari,14/08/2021,"The site is privileged and comfortable to spend a few days in Zahara. Concert at the beach bar every night. We listened to the comments and turned left. The result was a motorhome with a bottle and music until 3 in the morning . In the morning, a neighbor from the houses next door asked us to change places because we made her house dim with the Ac."
26458,1450457,1,PonichiAC,13/08/2021,"It is good to stop and see the town and go to the beach but to spend the night is shameful, between the music of the beach bars until 1am, the bottles, the people passing by and the traffic of cars… .it is not worth it. Obviously it is the only thing there is, but I do not recommend it in high season as it is now. € 18 from 8pm to 10am."
26458,1439107,4,kikesan,11/08/2021,Close to the beach and the town. good place to relax. It is shared with vehicles and is open 24 hours so you pay for the time you stay. €18 24 hours.

26458,1340366,2,josepsantfeli,19/07/2021,To spend the night it is correct! 18 euros without services... there is little in the area for a camper
26458,1336863,4,Araceli76,18/07/2021,"Central urban parking and 2 minutes from the beach through wooden walkways. Allows overnight. The 18 eur you pay for the location because it does not have any service. Be careful, it is wrongly located in the application, it tells you to enter a narrow street where you cannot turn around. Access is 2 streets ahead. We did not like the treatment of the boy who watches over, very unkind, he did not provide us with anything."

It is a quiet place to spend the night and sunrise next to the beach, although you cannot see the sea from the parking lot."

26458,747286,4,rvanvugt,26/11/2019,"Out of the main season, this parking is really a hit. Parking meters dismantled, direct access to the wonderful beach, almost no other people around, quiet during day and night, space enough for all dimensions of vehicles, simply ideal and almost perfect. I can imagine that this is not the case during the main season, but hey, then you find another spot somewhere else. If it would have had a service area, I would have given full five stars... 

I spend three nights, lots of time on the beach, my dogs lived it here too. Wonderful!"

26493,3186259,3,domimolina,20/08/2023,"We were in the red zone for 6 nights with a campervan. There are no hedges and the pitches are small, so little privacy. The toilets are only cleaned once a day. The men's toilets in particular were often dirty. Unfortunately, the night's rest was not observed in our area. The supermarket is very good and the check-in went smoothly. The proximity to the sea is also great!"

The proximity of the beach is practical and pleasant to enjoy or go for a nice walk. qAs for the swimming pool, you can take refreshing moments. Without forgetting Gibraltar for a great discovery."

26493,2750788,3,OakeyBoi,15/05/2023,Nice camp site with a little shop. We didn’t get to pick out pitch but they were all under trees and had good shade. The reception was very helpful and spoke good English. Didn’t rate the food at the restaurant. There was a lovely bear down on the beach with great sunsets. We stayed in May and the pool didn’t open until 1st June.

We think it's good value for money: €29 for a camper + 2 people, without electricity at the end of August. We found the showers and toilets clean. Very friendly reception, good mini market, beautiful beach in about 15 minutes walking distance. A bit noisy in the evening ;-)"

26493,2166965,4,Rafikis,03/08/2022,"The campsite is located in a privileged place: being able to walk down to Valdevaqueros is priceless. The campsite is fine, easy access, good swimming pool and super; the bathrooms a fair bit. Our fairly large parcel in the Kampaoh area. There is a bus that connects the campsites in the area with Tarifa and Playa Bolonia, although we could not use it because in principle they do not allow dogs."

Camping without animation with many children with nothing for them but two swings, we got an area of plots where it smells like a pipe and you can't even be there. The pool is good but overcrowded by the dates. we will not return"

26493,1355217,2,perala,23/07/2021,"It seems that it is not bad, but there was no way to stay: reservations online, they do not pick up the phone, and they were fighting us giving us bad pitches, on top of that telling us that they were good, with shade ... we took several walks until we got tired, and we we went, of course. A shame customers were lost for 4 or 5 nights ...."
26493,1352474,3,Sanferminera,22/07/2021,"A very large and very beautiful campsite with many services. The negative is that the pool hours are from 12 a.m. to 8 p.m., it seems late to me that a campsite will have the pool so late, and another negative aspect was the plot, it was small and dirty, I don't know if they gave us that because we only passed one night, but there were many vacant plots and in better condition. I don't think I will repeat."

You can fill water but not empty water, which is the only thing I lack. The rest is perfect."

26493,685828,2,jan28850,11/09/2019,"The campsite itself, not bad, the receptionists very friendly and attentive in general, but not having soap or toilet paper in the bathrooms today, is to leave and never return, which is what we have done."
26493,492858,3,fkmb,26/05/2019,"Helpful staff. Badly demarcated spaces, some between trees, which makes it difficult to maneuver the vehicle when parking. Users without education, who do not respect the others listening to music and making noise until late, without provisions on the part of the camping. We had to change places to get to sleep."

26494,3216768,5,Quietscheente2922,25/08/2023,Great place above Granada (30 min) and Sierra Nevada (30 min). Beautiful parcels. Swimming pool great. Sanitary facilities always clean. Restaurant very good and cheap. Can't understand the bad reviews. The only point: not all places may be suitable for large WoMos.
26494,2714821,3,anettes,01/05/2023,has seen better days. Everything a bit shabby. The swimming pool doesn't work anymore. But very clean sanitary facilities. hot showers. Good wifi. nice restaurant. Good location for walking or cycling.

Pitches are small but ok. the place need more care: playground partly dangerous. broken, green pool, old faded signs, little things, but they make up the overall picture. Registration was ok, a bit rough"
26494,2673165,3,A.Arri,15/04/2023,"The campsite is in a very nice and super quiet place. The facilities are quite old. There was only hot water in the downstairs bathrooms and the closest spaces were occupied, so we didn't have to place near the upstairs bathrooms, which left a lot to be desired. As for the treatment, correct but unprofessional."
26494,2655738,5,Repullo,09/04/2023,Don't worry. Cheap. Good ubication. No more.
26494,2576049,3,Lafurgodejack,12/02/2023,It's worth it to get out of trouble if you can't find something closer to Granada. Plots that a l2h2 enters more than fair. Dirty bathrooms but the good thing is that it was hot.
26494,2558123,1,fixion99,22/01/2023,"Well... the campsite does not have hot water, you fill clean water and it comes out brown, very dirty, the sewage drain is little more than a hole in the ground and on top of that the rudeness of the staff that attends you, not recommendable."
26494,2471106,4,almi1,30/10/2022,Small but quiet campsite. It is better to notify beforehand if you come with AC so that they can place you in the plots at the entrance. Well located for the Los Cahorros route
26494,2393681,3,danfjr1300,22/09/2022,4/25/22. Very small pitch. With 7.80m make a niche between 2 hurdles!! Very calm. Shady. A little old. Payment in cash only.
26494,2348933,4,pablikenedy,07/09/2022,"We spent one night after doing routes through Sierra Nevada. Enough to stop and rest with its pool, beach bar and little traffic of people. It seemed cheap to me"
26494,2233912,1,liandou,14/08/2022,I subscribe to the comments and add that the camping supermarket is closed. Showers only cold water. We won't be back. With the motorhome it is very difficult to maneuver and above all without paving.
26494,1835853,1,Wpacolo,18/04/2022,"Dirty bathrooms, flooded and without paper, without soap and,,,. It is a pity the good situation of the Campig and how abandoned it is. A facelift to the services and kitchenware washing areas would not hurt…. It's not worth what it costs"
26494,1769359,1,Angelafo,28/02/2022,"Very steep slopes, very small plots and difficult parking. Terrible services and manager appears like the ghosts to see what you do. If you don't want to leave your clutch on those slopes, don't even think about going. I have gone in a caravan and never again. 23 euros without electricity for two adults and only 3 hot showers in the lower part of the campsite. What a bad time I had!"

Branches protrude into the lane. shower ok Black and gray water in a floor inlet that cannot be approached directly with the camper. Disposal only possible with the bucket or hose. Opposite a restaurant where the registration takes place. Landscaped with views of Sierra Nevada and Granada in the distance.
26494,1747014,1,mirtheandfou,03/02/2022,"I'd be happy to drive on. Steep and narrow road to the pitches and very difficult to park in the spaces, especially with a longer bus or camper. View is on a quarry, not worth the effort. For people who want to do the Los Cahorros hike, I would recommend parking somewhere else, hiking and spending the night somewhere else."
26494,1706729,4,marialed81,08/12/2021,"We spent one night with our large volume van. Well defined plots. Camping with all services although a bit old, especially the gray and black cast. The gray ones in a sewer in one of the streets of the campsite. In the restaurant you eat very well."

26494,1447711,2,viensonlefait,12/08/2021,"Warning ! Very complicated to climb the hills to get to the campsite (old vans is a hassle !, and camping because it seems complicated to me) Arrived at the campsite, the paths are bumpy and narrow, taking a place is very very complicated. We scuffed our van. The children's games are dilapidated and dangerous, the swimming pool is 1m60 so it's a hassle for the little ones. Do not close the toilet door at the risk of getting stuck…. The hot showers are at the entrance of the campsite so far away, the cold showers are very cold and the doors are left ajar. No support for business or coat rack. In short, to escape the heat it's cool but there is still a lot of hassle. The restaurant is very expensive, the most expensive of our road trip (potato and 1 fried egg is not phew)"

The owner did not let us empty, or recharge for not staying in your camping, saying that they would charge us anything, so we did not eat at their restaurant either, we already know the saying, where they do not want us, because we are not going."

26494,128183,4,malineta,16/04/2017,"Nice, quiet place. Clean toilets. No problems with animals. The only thing that is careful with the mastiffs they have is that they are very good with people but they throw themselves at the dogs. We went with a camper, but I do not know if a big car would fit."

After 11pm, city noises were also minimal. Slept well until 08:00. Then used this parking as a base for the city visit. Big plus is the shade. The camper stays, relatively, cool."

City center about 20 minutes on foot. And 10 minutes by bike, there are 3 spots of city bikes around the park.
Safe park."

26509,438326,1,Ledgerca,09/03/2019,I can't recommend this location. From about 2130hrs on a Saturday evening the locals came out to party and kick around a football which they kicked against my van. I don't know if it was accidental or not but I didn't have good feelings about staying there any longer and decided to move.
26509,433115,1,Cloben,24/02/2019,"The spot in itself is correct, at the entrance of the park, however, the party-goers who come out after 7am on Sunday to listen to the bad Spanish music braying, have spoiled the experience. To do only to troubleshoot, ok if you have planned to leave at dawn to visit Seville"
26509,227129,2,critom07,11/03/2018,We easily found a place on Saturday and we parked the day for a visit to Seville (in March).

Around 7 there were several cars and they were doing a bottle but they left before 10 and they did not make any noise. Quiet at night although by day there are quite a few cars parked. There is a civic center in the park (about 300m) where you can go to the bathroom.

26509,222530,1,jennymarie,12/02/2018,I can not even give this place 1 star. We parked here on a Thursday night Feb 18 it looked idilyic until midnight when it about 40 men (not kids) turned up drinking and taking drugs with rave music blasting out and bottles being smashed. There were 4 MH parked here and we were trapped and couldn’t get out. No harm done to any vans or cars but it was very scary and felt very vulnerable. It went on till about 4am then the council turned up to clear the carnage left behind. I don’t know if this was a one off but I will definitely not be returning to find out.

That is a lot of work, finding a connection and unrolling the hose to make it dry again. 4 watering cans and it was done. A lot of water can be tapped with €2.

Truck attached to the AC area all the time on (I imagine that it is better to annoy the caravanists than their companions), the restaurant dirty and with a bad smell, the guys who serve attentive, yes. I had to stay because it got dark and we are going with children. I don't recommend it at all."

Recommended."

If you are not clear on which plot you are going to enter, do not come. because first you always get sun, here it hits. if you then ask to be moved to an empty one with shade, they are always reserved. excessive prices for how far it is from the beaches."

Luz can be reached on foot, Lagos with your own car or mobile home. It was our most expensive but also best campsite so far. It was worth every penny (paid around €30 per day with a baby without electricity). Washing machine and dryer €5.50 each, gym €5 per day."

26691,2674081,4,Chantal.M,16/04/2023,Very nice campsite. A lot offered for children. Also for teens. Prices a little weird. Children from 7 years old are considered adults and pay 7 euros per day. Dog costs 6 euros per day. High season is calculated as early as April. We as a family of 4 with a dog paid 54 euros per day with electricity. From 10 days 10% will be charged.

Families are not welcome in winter (pensioner place). IMPORTANT: the booking system cannot change the year, discounts for longer stays are often not calculated correctly, invoices are not comprehensible, mistakes seem to be intentional."
26691,2548930,1,0park4night0,11/01/2023,Pitches are very small. Staff is not helpfull and knowledgeable about their own campsite.
26691,2548437,1,JohannaJergens,10/01/2023,"Like others before us, we were turned away. First of all, the employee searched the PC and asked how many people we were. After we had stated that there were 2 children, the information came that the place was fully booked until the end of March. Seats can still be booked online. Presumably in the winter season more pensioners among themselves."
26691,2548171,3,Prorom,10/01/2023,"The equipment is of course top and the prices reasonable. It is cleaned several times a day. However, the place is rather remote and Luz is a bit spooky in winter. Above all, the pitches are rather tight. Our 70m2 pitch, for example, was much smaller and had a tree in the middle. Why so many liners come here of all places is a mystery to me."
26691,2545737,4,BJB8586,07/01/2023,"Mhmm, actually a really nice and well-made place. But really far off the mark if you're not mobile in any way."
26691,2542977,4,Campinglovers6762,05/01/2023,Stayed for 12 nights over Christmas. Lovely pitches and helpful staff. We moved pitch from the far side to the side nearer the facilities only because it was warmer. The far side you are in the shade all day so something to be aware of plus there’s noise from building work at the moment with diggers moving all day. Walk to the sea was lovely and the seafront was very pretty with good restaurants.
26691,2533655,5,Tucha,30/12/2022,"Campsite with a huge variety of services included in the price. Very quiet, 5-star showers with hot water. Excellent for a luxury upgrade during our visit to this area! Very friendly receptionists, welcoming and explain everything very well.

26691,2527997,4,junindelos,25/12/2022,"The campsite, despite the fact that there are areas under construction (these days of Christmas, the operators are not working), is a very quiet place, large spaces to park our motorhome, electricity, water and drainage on the plot (de luxe). What seems expensive to me is paying 6 euros per dog per day, in the bungalows I would understand it, but in the plots it seems excessive. very clean bathrooms"
26691,2524962,1,RotecGo,20/12/2022,We were turned away in mid-December. First the employee checked the PC and then told us that she didn't have a seat. I know in advance when I'm fully booked... funny
26691,2523469,1,gooutbecrazy,17/12/2022,"Were rejected here at the beginning of December on the grounds that the places were flooded. The retired couple in front of us were offered a place, which they declined for price reasons.

26691,2520157,3,UrSch58,12/12/2022,"Large place, which is now very well occupied. We chose a super deluxe pitch for our 10m motorhome, which was long enough but otherwise not really big, for EUR 29 per night. Unfortunately, both on arrival and on departure, a truck resp. Construction excavators on the tarred main connecting route, which resulted in unnecessary manoeuvres. Reception occupied by 1 person!"
26691,2519289,4,rhiwarbs,11/12/2022,Good campsite with great facilities. medium sized plot (blue) in off season was €26. A deluxe plot was €29 & you get your own tap. we picked a plot close to the facilities as there was heavy rain so we didn't want to walk far but we recommend walking through the park to check your plot first as ours was slightly off level. we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend to fellow campers
26691,2515984,5,wagnersvanlife,08/12/2022,"Super campsite that can only be recommended: heated pool, top sanitary facilities even with a hair dryer, everything very well maintained, very nice reception, unfortunately the restaurant was under construction.

To put a but the garbage containers are at the entrance of the campsite and depending on where you are installed it is a bit far. The water change area of the motorhomes very neat and comfortable."
26691,2462984,5,DavyCapiau,26/10/2022,The best camping we had in our Portugal trip!
26691,2459112,1,stich44,23/10/2022,"Facilities, 5/5. The rest 0/5. Cruel lack of freedom (dogs must be on a leash all the time even if they are at your feet otherwise reflection guaranteed. Access to the washing machine is impossible after 9 p.m. but you are woken up at 9 a.m. by chainsaws! access to my site, the 619, was quite sporty my Cc measures 7m40m In short, too factory and not at all camping spirit"

26691,2445734,5,svrt,15/10/2022,"Very nice place, there is an extensive entertainment program with fitness, hikes and evening entertainment. Sanitary facilities are modern and very clean. Pitches vary in size, we had a lot of bird droppings on the roof and awning"
26691,2443935,5,jenn_y_au,15/10/2022,"The children have their own bathroom for their needs and toilet, which makes the bathroom much easier for parents, a 10 for this initiative. The pools and jacuzzi are very nice. The restaurant varied offer. It is undoubtedly the best campsite in the Algarve, although somewhat expensive"

Possibility to go by bike to Lagos 30mn or the bus. small village Luz (beach) 15m by bike. I recommend"
26691,2433647,5,Trav3ll3r,09/10/2022,Very good campsite. Many services and activities. We got a very large plot. Electricity included in the price. Good cocktails at the snack bar. I wouldn't recommend it for just staying overnight.
26691,2419394,1,benmuenst,02/10/2022,"This Campsite is the worst. They praise it as a luxury campside, even if they are not. We didnt want luxury but we wanted friendly staff, free internet (I think this should be normal nowadays, espacially for this price.) Everything is really narrow. You have to walk for ages until you get to the bins. There is loud music in the evening playing and it is really expensive for what it is. Never again"
26691,2418800,1,julie25788,02/10/2022,"Far too expensive (35€/night 2 people 1 van), all vehicles close together, huge campsite. You pay for internet if you want more than 1 access, hotspot doesn't work. Unfriendly staff. So far the worst camping in 3 weeks Portugal."

26691,2413968,5,vaziuojam,30/09/2022,"A beautiful, well maintained establishment. Has all the services, decent sized pitches. The larger ones have individual water supply as well, all pitches have electricity. Showers, WC included in the nightly price, exceptionally clean, plentiful. The pool area is super comfortable and nice too - enough sun loungers, large swimming area, both indoors and outdoors, 2 jacuzzis. Absolutely recommend!"
26691,2412192,5,teadelo,29/09/2022,"Great, the facilities are new and extremely clean. We paid 27€ for one night. The location was great and the night was very quiet no noise"

26691,2230023,4,Rafikis,13/08/2022,"A very good campsite, possibly the best in Portugal. Good organization, excellent cleanliness, magnificent pools and great pitches. Still, it's off the road and too far to walk anywhere. They don't reserve for a few nights and their last-minute system is strict: sign up in person on a waiting list from 8:00 to 9:30 and wait nearby in case they call you at 12:30 :("
26691,2227955,4,A.HAMEL,13/08/2022,We spent three nights in a tent pitch under 60m2 for €153 for two people. The pitches are very good because despite the fact that the campsite is hilly all the pitches are level. There are not enough showers and despite the comments the lifeguard does not watch the pool at all. To recharge it is very well water and electricity included.
26691,2210105,5,Jacob94,10/08/2022,"Excellent campsite with many facilities (swimming pool, jaccuzi, spa, restaurant, bar, shower for animals), very clean sanitary facilities, very welcoming, 67€ for one night on a large pitch (2 people in a fitted 4x4) with access to the water and electricity."

26691,2162731,5,matthieuablin,02/08/2022,"Camping with rather high prices in view of the rates charged in the country but which is very correct in view of the services offered. Great campsite! Incredibly clean. We can thank the cleaning ladies who are present at all times in the sanitary facilities. 2 swimming pools, one of which is heated, jacuzzis, spa and gym at an additional cost, mini-market, restaurant and snack bar. Perfect sized pitches. There is even a place to wash your dog! Unheard of. I highly recommend !"
26691,2154030,5,Markmetznbus,31/07/2022,"Big relatively new campsite with pitches and holidayhomes. Really well maintained, best sanitairy, two swimming pools and more! If you wish to stay away from the noise of Animation and the crowd, try to get a spot on top of the camping on the outskirts. You will have some (cooling) wind and views over the landscape. 30min walk to the beach, 15min by bus to Lagos, 10min with Uber."
26691,2138773,5,lebonro,29/07/2022,"Excellent campsite the best we did in 2 weeks from north to south of Portugal, the most expensive too (58 € one night with van 2 children 2 adults water and electricity on the pitch) but when you see the facilities and services we do not regret, I strongly recommend!"

26691,2075660,4,Melala,15/07/2022,Very well maintained. Convenient for getting around the area. On the other hand expensive for one night 2 adults and two children 54 euros van and electricity.
26691,2062593,4,Bob68,11/07/2022,"indeed a comfortable campsite, even showers for dogs, but the restaurant is average and expensive, the snack is average, the screened swimming pool. It's a yellow village, everything is tarred. Camping expensive. I won't be back, everything is the opposite of vanlife. in love with peace and nature passed your way if not good vacancy."

There is a show every evening, very friendly staff, clean sanitary facilities, great pool with an additional indoor pool. Large, clean pitches. The best campsite in the Algarve so far. We'd love to come back!"
26691,2034443,4,delta2366,03/07/2022,"Large, well organised quiet campsite. The facilities are kept extremely clean and tidy. If you want a campsite with pool, bar and entertainment then this is the place for you."

26691,2003703,3,mrs_haase,23/06/2022,"Nice area, space/showers/pool/toilet etc everything clean. Some playgrounds for children. However, our biggest shortcoming is: You are not allowed to grill on your own camp site, and there is no alternative such as a barbecue area. An absolute no-go for us. Grilling is an essential part of camping! A large beer at the bar only costs 2.50 euros ;) and tastes good!"

26691,1970115,5,flow111,12/06/2022,"This campsite leaves nothing to be desired. Large, well-kept, clean sanitary facilities, pool, a great range of leisure activities and not far from the beaches in the area. Lagos has a cool night scene. Yoga on the beach in Luz (found on Airbnb)."
26691,1964710,5,KangooRoots,10/06/2022,"Very nice place for a relaxing break. Super clean sanitary facilities, possibility to drain and fill up with water and above all 1 large outdoor swimming pool, 1 large heated indoor swimming pool and two large jacuzzi areas. We were there at the start of the season but it must be less peaceful in the middle of the season. A little expensive but the services are niquel: for 1 cc: 2 people and 2 dogs 45€/d"
26691,1950875,5,hamsammy,06/06/2022,Great campground to use as a home base for an evening before heading back out into the wilderness. Laundry is 5 euro per load & you have to buy a coin at the reception. The pool & jacuzzi are great considering the heat during the day. Paid 32 euro for a campervan with 2 people for 1 night. Got a larger pitch with electricity. Their rates change depending on the season.
26691,1937480,5,Nxtcentury,01/06/2022,"One of the most beautiful places in Portugal. Luxurious sanitary facilities and a charming pool area. We paid 27€ for 2 people and the second smallest pitch size.
The only negative thing is that it takes over 30 minutes to get to the beach. But there is also a bus."
26691,1932508,5,filou44350,30/05/2022,"Very nice campsite, well-defined pitch, always impeccable toilets. Welcomed by Gabrielle who is French and very friendly. 29 € with services I recommend."
26691,1931292,5,Mainzer19,30/05/2022,"Nice place with everything you need. Hot showers, restaurant and bar, small supermarket, swimming pool... The plots are very different, some are very small and in the sun. But if you have a nice place, you can bear it. Sea is a few kilometers away, electric bike, I would recommend because of the difference in altitude. But then a great bay with a sandy beach."
26691,1927521,5,reschima,29/05/2022,"Five star campsite with everything you need. Very large area, sanitary extremely clean. Lagos nearby. Camping supermarket priced quite expensive."
26691,1916686,5,Nely,26/05/2022,"The best campsite I've been to, without a doubt, both the pitches and the bungalows. The spectacular pool, if I went back to the Algarve I would go back."
26691,1912012,5,pk1tour,24/05/2022,"Very nice reception. You get told the free places and can then choose one or more. Discounts for ADAC and ACSI! With us it was €5.80 discount for two nights. Really sensational campsite! Like in a hotel, except that you sleep in the camper and there are shared showers and toilets. A beautiful large indoor pool with 31 and 36 degrees. Also perfect for very small children. Price performance is great! We will be back."
26691,1904755,5,franklouwersr,21/05/2022,"Superb, well-maintained campsite. Excellent price / quality ratio. Lots of entertainment for children, good swimming facilities. Excellent base for day trips in the Algarve. stood 3 nights. However, wifi is moderate to poor while we were right next to the facilities and only included for 1 device. Unwittingly, we bought extra wifi at check-in, but you save the costs."
26691,1903124,3,WalTro,20/05/2022,We booked for 2 mobile homes and made an inquiry in advance via the service page and expressed our wish to be able to stand next to each other if possible. Is only possible if you pay an additional 35.-€ when booking!! Sorry this is pure rip off. With an overnight price of 31.-€ we were then assigned 2 places with numbers 100 and 900!! This is not customer service!!!!
26691,1881564,5,utkugokce,10/05/2022,Wow very cool place. We stayed longer than planned
26691,1872251,5,b3rny,05/05/2022,"We paid €30 per motorhome and 4 people, in May 2022. That price seems fair to me: facilities of 10 and very clean. Decent and not very expensive bar... Plot: no complaints about the space and that we had about the medium ones. The children enjoyed the pools, the games and the special baths for them. A little stuffy atmosphere but if you go your own way it is ideal to relax for a couple of days."
26691,1868150,4,Taxaner,03/05/2022,"Basically good campsite, very clean. Sanitary new and well maintained, indoor and outdoor pool. Restaurant and bistro, ok. The small supermarket is ok. What we didn't like: We were standing tight on tight like in a rabbit hole. Every corner, no matter how small, is assigned as a parking space. Max. 10 km/h on the course, only the employees are much faster with their golf carts."
26691,1833843,5,TimCamping,18/04/2022,Most beautiful campsite in Portugal. Has everything you need. It was pretty busy and you should reserve in advance.
26691,1816959,5,millimolekuel,12/04/2022,"Great on rainy days because there is a heated indoor pool. The staff is super friendly. All in all more like a club complex with lots of quite loud offers (kids club, aqua gym, salsa,...). Depending on your needs, either very exhausting or very relaxing :)"
26691,1810279,5,gretchen1501,08/04/2022,"Very nice campsite. Many activities possible. Toilets very clean and well maintained. Unfortunately a bit difficult linguistically, because only some of the staff speaks English but absolutely doable :)"

26691,1736050,1,drlbradley,17/01/2022,"12 euros per day for our two little dogs… only here because we need to be but at 38 euros per day, our stay will be very brief. The site is on a main, busy road and not close to anything. The staff in reception are rude and treat their paying “guests” like an inconvenience. There is a sauna, gym etc but all at an extra charge which feels a little wrong with such high site fees."
26691,1720770,5,womo1211,31/12/2021,"Indoor swimming pool is amazing for children. Nice facilities, very big camping site. The beach in Luz is very nice Also good for surfing but a bit far away."

Very well taken care of facilities; modern showers, great restaurant, nice pool & new sunbeds (not the blue ones in the picture),supermarkt with fresh products.

Pool, toilets, showers ... clean"

Sanitary very clean but a drainage area only for all camping with, and it is a mistake, the opportunity to wash his vehicle. It was 4 am to 10 am this morning waiting for the person who scrubbed his vehicle conscientiously to make room for those who wanted to refuel and drain before leaving. He did not prove to know how to live and continued arguing that he was in his right. After passing to complain at the reception, nothing has changed! Pity."

Reason is not lacking, it is great, it has even gym and jacuzzi and I also know that to maintain such a camping you need a lot of money. But in case we arrived and there were few places and the plots were expensive. 3 people with the AC and our dog € 66 on the plot that costs less and for one night. 15 minutes from there there is another camper park after its services and it is cheaper than spending a night in that one. It does not mean that the campsite is a luxury, but the price for one night seemed abusive."

To take a place you have to get up early. And expect someone to leave the place. But it catches more or less fast. Very kind and nice staff. They control the issue of noise a lot. Especially at night. He rests very well. The different pools with different temperatures and hot tubs are wonderful. With many sun loungers and umbrellas. The washer, dryer and ironing facilities are very clean and new. € 5 washer and € 5 dryer. It has bathrooms for very funny little kids and fun colors. They also have dog laundry. Leisure and activities for children in the mini club. Two hits; They lack some large slide in the pool for older children and has few showers and at certain times you have to queue. Price per night in August car + caravan + 2 adults + 2 children € 70. It doesn't matter to pay when it has the good quality it has."

26691,567534,4,fhaelito,21/07/2019,Camping of the best of the Algarve. We find it somewhat expensive compared to other 5 star campsites in France. Anyway the facilities are new and are quite clean. The only one is that there is a lot of traffic inside the premises of the people who stay in the bungalows and who are constantly entering and leaving the campsite.
26691,563203,5,Josy123,19/07/2019,"The best campsite we entered the Algarve! In high season we pay for one day € 59 two children 2 adults, large plot with shade.

26697,2727667,2,pasandvan,06/05/2023,Very nice lakeside setting but close to apartment buildings. We found a flat spot a little further down this road. Lots of passing cars and motorbikes late at night (we are on a Friday evening).

26697,2668817,4,bikerpedro,14/04/2023,"Quiet location except for a dog in town??‍♂️One-way street, often garbage to the right of the sidewalk, but if one or the other puts on gloves and clears the garbage at least in front of the parking space, the community certainly doesn't mind."
26697,2625868,4,EvaHab,26/03/2023,Super took on the lake with four showers and plenty of roadside space. Perfect for a day at the lake beach.
26697,2614024,3,Xarin,18/03/2023,"If you are looking for peace, this is not the place for you. Since the place is beautiful, it is frequented by families with children during the day and by young people in the evenings, even in the off-season. We weren't bothered by children screaming, music and loud conversations. All campers looked for another place overnight. Since the police came by more often, we assume that you have to pay a fine for overnight stays."
26697,2539399,5,gretelbola,03/01/2023,"Quiet and pleasant place. No noise at night during the week at least. Lots of day walkers with dogs. The police passed 2 times and they have not told us anything, they have only greeted us."
26697,2457355,1,mietzellie,23/10/2022,Unsuitable for a night on Saturday. First the nearby hotel with party with loud music until 23:00 and from midnight many different groups of young people with scooters and cars speeding by and talking/singing aloud near the camper. We decided to drive 1 hour at night to another place to stay. During the day a nice place to visit the beach.
26697,2457147,3,AdventureFam,22/10/2022,Average parking on the side of the road next to the small beach and near a cafe/bar. Noisy on this Friday night with cars and people going past until the early hours.
26697,2448809,5,Bozogozo,17/10/2022,"Great place for a stopover out of season (imagine busy in summer), parking on road but  next to the beach with safe swimming area and lovely view over to Arcos. A bit busier wirh dog walkers in evenings but we had a peaceful night with 2 other campers."

26697,1921906,5,Ilikevanlife,27/05/2022,Superb artificial beach ideal for swimming with children. Right next to a bar. I won't sleep here because no privacy but perfect for a stopover.

26697,1877033,3,bienzobas,08/05/2022,"Spectacular place to spend the night and spend a beautiful day at the lake, the negative part is the amount of 2 puppies and on top of that they put it in the water, which should be totally prohibited, since children bathe next to it."

26697,1720449,3,algonzalef,30/12/2021,We were in the afternoon to watch the sunset and great. But we left at night because young people from the area began to appear. No problems but we don't have good experiences so we went to another quieter area next door.
26697,1708961,2,fred.voyage,12/12/2021,"Narrow (car width) parking lanes are marked to the right and left of the one-way street. Some areas are flat, others with a slight incline. Even late at night, cars and motorcycles drive past you. The lake is beautiful, very good for the day. Also not far to go to Arcos by bike. But better park elsewhere for a quiet night."

26697,1223742,3,Noeruben,29/05/2021,"Beautiful place to bathe if you go with children, they enjoy it very much. We have been on a Friday and it has not been quiet at all, all night passing cars, motorcycles and people to the beach. The Nautical club in the area begins to have a movement of people at 7 in the morning. For more peace of mind, I would go ahead and avoid this a bit if it is the weekend."

26729,2936272,4,nicky966,08/07/2023,Nice place with good views. Very clean. We found other people spending the night. There is a lot of movement at night and in the morning but it is not excessive. To get there I recommend first putting the town in the GPS (Margarida de Montbui) and once there put the location since otherwise it can take you along another path which is totally inaccessible. I'll take your trash :)

Many people during the day that go up to walk, see the views ... there is a small park for children and many benches. We went on Saturday and around 9 pm several groups of young people began to come with bottles, so we decided to leave because a very noisy night was approaching. I guess midweek will be fine."

26771,2625277,5,PBeta,26/03/2023,"Very good, the permit to sleep is in a number of the local police and it is next to it in case you do not want to call. There are security cameras in case there was any theft that I doubt in Menorca and it is super clean! Excellent"
26771,2590343,5,Santiago2022,25/02/2023,"Beautiful Free loading and unloading area, in a former barracks, if you stay overnight you have to call some numbers to pay €8."
26771,2558238,5,EnRouteLaMue,22/01/2023,"We used the black water and gray water drains in January, very practical. For any information, just call the 2 numbers indicated on the panel (morning or afternoon). The mill restaurant next door is very good. The esplanade is used as a walk for dogs... watch out for droppings!"
26771,2530460,5,alexyanezdelacal,28/12/2022,We have filled and emptied black and gray for free.
26771,2418556,4,Maldivas,02/10/2022,"For great filling and emptying, there is an esplanade to be able to eat, to sleep there will be a lot of noise, because the main road is next to it."
26771,2353595,3,castor79,09/09/2022,"Indeed, we can congratulate the municipality for having set up this parking and service area. From the square and 2 steps from the city center. I confirm that it is complicated to pay when you want it, which is the least of things, because the local police officers in the nearby office do not often seem to be present. Important downside all the same: the noise linked to the incessant flow of vehicles on the ME1."
26771,2293414,4,chris31130,24/08/2022,"Free access parking, at the bottom of an unsupervised complex, little frequented. Perfect for water loading and electricity connection. Toilets in municipal building. 8€ per night and use of services. BUT payment almost impossible: where, when, how, to whom?? you have to call the number mentioned on a panel, but you have to speak and understand Spanish! So we took water without paying."
26771,2286804,5,lauraarisasancho,22/08/2022,"Municipal payment area, with shower, toilet, electricity, grey, black and filling water, it is €8 but there are people who find it difficult to pay that and shower in their face, the police give them some keys to the bathroom, close it because if you don't you will find dirty"
26771,2164519,3,jaritajarutxi,02/08/2022,Important note. From August 1 to 15 the area is closed for holidays. Overnight or emptying is not allowed on these days.
26771,2136097,2,VeraLis,28/07/2022,"Point out that if you pay, it's €8 yes or yes. We spent the night because we needed light. The AC and vans area is an esplanade of dusty land without shade. In the morning it gives a little but nothing more. Close to Es Mercandal. But at night rats come out for a walk. It has certainly been horrible. You have showers and toilets available. We couldn't fill water because it was burning"
26771,2107255,4,gervicen,22/07/2022,"Just point out that if you pay, they indicate that there are cameras and whoever does not take the ticket at the police office that is right there will be penalized. There is no shade, we are in July and it is a plain in the sun that could hardly be during the day. Good services and pleasant treatment. We had a hard time finding it, even with the gps, something is wrong with the location, look for the local police."
26771,2094465,5,LeireLeonet,19/07/2022,There are public toilets with showers.
26771,2041829,5,gonzoo,05/07/2022,"Fantastic place to change gray water, black water and recharge clean. There is a sign informing that €8 is charged and that you must call a telephone to use the area. We did it and they told us that the water change was not charged, so everything was perfect!"
26771,1477134,1,sidzero,18/08/2021,"They are pirates, we have gone to empty the poty (xk ironworks was covered up) and to take a shower. The same local cops have charged us € 8, saying it's a one-time fee. the bathrooms were locked. There is no running water and you need your own hose, and it is a dirt field without a shade. I do not know .... we have paid emptied the poty and to continue the march I do not stay there or have enough wine"
26771,1470350,2,tognins5,17/08/2021,Es Mercadal is a strategic place to get to know the island. An ideal place to make a good breakfast and plan the day with a coffee and something to eat from the classic Balearic bakeries. The RV area is pretty mediocre. A clearing with the bathrooms closed (they say COVID on the subject) next to the main road and without any incentive. It is still worth 8 euros / night. LoveMenorca.
26771,1419022,1,eloyTF,07/08/2021,Due to covid there is no shower service
26771,1348108,1,Jordizel,21/07/2021,"The rate is unique, even if you only use it to empty, they also want to charge you € 8. I called to find out on the phone that appears on the posters and they told us that, which is € 8 even if you only use it to empty. We have left without doing so. Keep it in mind!"
26771,1347615,5,gaizkabar,21/07/2021,"Large and quiet parking. Near the village. You have to pay € 8 at the local police for the night, emptying of water and filling for free. It also has electricity. It was our base several times when it came to emptying and filling water. We only slept one night."
26771,1347374,4,IsaacSR,21/07/2021,"Very large area with discharge of gray and black water, loading of water and electricity. Little shade area. Upon entering you have to go through the local police office (it is in the same premises), and pay 8 euros / 24h whatever you do. It costs the same to download only water than to spend the night. It is in the same town of Es Mercadal, it has nothing special but it has all the services available."
26771,1221506,5,RC1003,27/05/2021,"Perfect. 8 euros for 24 hours, water and electricity change included. Trash bins. Laundry in the village. Supermarkets, restaurants, etc. Charge the municipal police, super friendly."

26771,1012140,5,JCV88,29/08/2020,"In August 2020 they had it open for free due to the COVID issue. All perfect for changing waters and plugging in or spending nights. if you are going to sleep there is a road next to it, it is not a big deal but you can hear the cars."
26771,972033,4,Furgoford,17/08/2020,"Large flat area with a lot of dust to park. You have to call in advance the local police that manage it. Wc closed by covid. They do not charge a fee. Emptying and filling of water. Toilet cleaning. Electricity, not in the whole area. Containers and surveillance. Close, walking, from the center."
26771,947135,5,Silvia2220222,10/08/2020,"We called the police before going to confirm our arrival and they took care of us reluctantly, they told us to go and do what we had to do. Even so when we arrived we warned that we were there and then they were more correct, they explained to us that due to Covid-19 the toilets are closed and they did not charge us a fee, we did two nights taking the opportunity to unload and leave the next day from a good location, as it is in the center of the island."
26771,921892,4,IsaduPerigord,02/08/2020,Watch out for the anthills under the trees which invade your entire motorhome overnight! Closed toilets. Dusty pitches. Clean drain area. FREE. The 8 € displayed are no longer claimed as explained to us by a municipal police officer on site. All shops and all amenities.

26771,531249,5,rakelmunoz,28/06/2019,"A good place to stop in Menorca. If you travel with dogs we could not go to camping, since both were forbidden, and this was our base camp for showers. it is managed by the police, and you have to call if they are not there so they come Mercadal is very close, nice town. Come to buy breakfast or bread to give de plaça or can sucrer, VERY good places. l"

26771,340986,5,elgeorge,18/08/2018,Unbeatable to recharge and empty. Quiet but noisy because of the proximity of the carriage.
26771,340449,4,Gorka9,18/08/2018,"This place is very well and well located, the only toilets and showers are not cleaned daily and for what they touched us for two days were pretty sloppy. They tell you that you have to warn but it is not necessary, there is always room."
26771,203168,4,asiereiro,15/10/2017,"Very good site, for € 8 per day there is access to filling and emptying of water, bathrooms and showers with hot water, electricity and a secure place to sleep (next to the local police). It misses a little shadow."
26771,192326,5,ArmoeAC,11/09/2017,"Thanks to the City Council for this installation more than acceptable, taking into account that we are in an Autonomous Community totally deficient in this type of facilities. It can be accessed without prior reservation."
26771,127808,3,javimetal,15/04/2017,"Very correct except that the hot water does not work, and in April it is still needed ...."
26771,50181,4,cristobalvilla,18/08/2015,"Excellent area All services, to my understanding it lacks trees with shade and WiFi access. It is a municipal area but curiously paid, because you have to pay € 8 per day. Another curiosity is that you have to book the place previously calling the municipal police as if it were a camping or a hotel, this is an inconvenience. The maximum stay is 72h."
26771,50106,3,tobal,17/08/2015,"Good area located in the beautiful village of ""Es Mercadal"" in the center of the island at the foot of Monte Toro. It has 20 seats, water, electricity, gray and black water drainage, completely flat pavement, lighting, garbage, surveillance by video cameras, next to the local police, 200 m. from the center of the town. you can use the services of toilets, waters and showers of the fairgrounds.

Camper vans are prohibited in the car park, you can park on the street above if there is space available… we were in a van and we were offered to park in the beach car park without difficulty. Paid parking €6.90 for the day"

26774,1644338,2,KePaXeta,14/10/2021,"Large parking Now in October all quiet, ideal for taking a bath and doing routes through the area. We have found everything closed but better this way, we prefer tranquility. I only value it with 2 stars, they do not allow us to spend the night, a pity, we would have stayed more days, this is just a place of passage."
26774,1629300,1,CherryCamping,06/10/2021,"It's a beautiful place, but there are park rangers regularly patrolling the street. There are no opportunities to hide from them as every place is very visible. We've been confronted by them at 1 am and they took our ID details. I would recommend going elsewhere, maybe on the other side of the lake because there is sun in the morning."
26774,1174955,5,jaimegpuente,17/04/2021,"Good parking with perfect location on the lake beach. We have spent the day here and we have not paid anything, I imagine it was the free summer!"

26774,887695,5,maria1977,21/07/2020,"We parked right next to the chiringuito and it was perfectly leveled. You have to go early if you want to get a good place, otherwise it will catch you some cost. The beach is very good and the water is great. It has a jetty to catch scooters, canoes or surfing. The chiringuito also quite good."
26774,560222,1,esencia,18/07/2019,"I've been going for many years and it's the most restricted nature park in Spain. The Civil Guard constantly harasses all drivers. Nefasta management of the park. By not regulating directly prohibit. Disappointing. The only decent City Hall is the Puebla one, more and more beautiful and cared for"
26774,528219,5,azulejo,25/06/2019,"The site is very good, with beach and bar at the same time, but it puts on a poster that is forbidden to spend the night. We slept in ribadelago, a town ahead."

26774,336840,5,alexclub,16/08/2018,Indeed large very clean parking with snack and beach. Empty in the summer around 9 pm yes the absolute calm. The police went in the morning to ask us not to sleep 2 nights in a row otherwise no worries;)
26774,97967,4,campchriscar,21/08/2016,Very nice place. We were just awakened by the Guardia Civil on Saturday morning who told us we could not sleep there ... but it was already done ;-)

26777,3238016,4,Zerpy,30/08/2023,"Well-kept campsite, some with small trees that provide some shade. Some plots are shaded with awnings (for vehicles up to 2.80 meters). On the smaller plots of 5x7 meters you can also stand close together with small vans. The paths are paved and the plots are gravelled, so there are occasional gusts of dusty wind. The sanitary facilities are spacious and very clean. There are enough cabins for toilets and showers, these with very good water pressure, warm with a removable shower and mixer. There are toilets and a baby bathtub for children. The playground with its black rubber surface is practically unusable in the sun. But there is the beautiful, large saltwater pool with a bar. The small supermarket is run by super-friendly staff and offers rolls, smoothies, ice cream and some essentials. Access to the square is strictly regulated using turnstiles and barriers. In the evening there is the delicious smell of charcoal grills, of which there are plenty, next to the shaded picnic benches."
26777,3186144,3,roz26,20/08/2023,Small and unshaded site. Sanitary correct. Swimming pool appreciated to cool off even if a lot of people. 41€ for a motorhome + electricity + 4 people

26777,2934825,2,olli82,07/07/2023,"The CP gives the impression of a large parking lot similar to a shopping center. The entire place is gravel and provided with streets. The facility is well-kept and clean, the pool is really nice but doesn't really give the impression of factory farming. We lacked charm here, maybe there are people who like this type of CP."

26777,2878659,5,ManuelBlessing,21/06/2023,"Not the most beautifully designed place (pitches), but the pitches are big enough and you have peace and quiet because it is well distributed. If the campsite were fully booked, it would probably look different. The sanitary facilities are not the newest, but always clean, as they are cleaned twice a day. There is currently a large construction site on the site. The pool area is beautifully designed and invites you in a friendly manner. Staff all very friendly and helpful. The restaurant is well priced and the food is good too. Would love to come back when the opportunity arises."

If you stand in the front seats, you can hear the railway line, where construction work is currently taking place. In addition, employees constantly drive through the rows with golf carts, you feel very observed, almost controlled."

The price is the usual in these places and it has a restaurant and a small supermarket with fresh bread first thing in the morning, which is appreciated. The food from the restaurant was put for us to take to the motorhome."

We would have preferred to be free."

26777,1850333,3,andreaundhendrik1,24/04/2022,Okay for one night in transit. But the place does not invite you to stay longer. Getting to the beach is not that easy. First comes the Ria Formosa nature reserve and you can take a water taxi from June to October to the offshore island to get to the sea.

26815,1707280,5,ninekatha,09/12/2021,"Beautiful place under pine trees very close to Barcelona! Lots of families, mountain bike riders and hikers / walkers at the weekend (some nice, easy paths through the woods into the surrounding mountains) The road didn't bother us a bit and it was nice and quiet at night! Unfortunately there are no toilets - but gladly again and again!"
26815,1698204,4,tamaraydavid,26/11/2021,Very nice picnic area with many routes. Sometimes it is a bit crowded and there are many cyclists and runners along the routes but it is great to sleep and spend a few days
26815,1697240,5,tingelsdeworld,24/11/2021,A wonderful place to forget the time. I couldn't hear the street and the alleged aircraft noise at night. One night turned into 2. Gladly again. Suitable for the location of the song by Thrice - Beyond the Pines.

26815,1321873,3,grisonsbear,13/07/2021,"Basically a good place to stay for a night. In the main season you are certainly not alone, which is not a problem. You can tell that this place is busy, especially because of all the rubbish in the forest (toilet paper, etc.). The street behind it was quiet at night."
26815,1316623,5,Romeos_Jule,12/07/2021,"Slept well here for 4 nights, even on the weekend. There is shade, opportunities to sit and eat. During the day we went down to the beach, or from there by train to Barcelona and got a seat in the evening."

26815,1201210,2,thetonioproject,16/05/2021,"No toilet shower found here, spot that helps out to go to the airport but very noisy, next to a big road and the 8am parking lot full of cars ... Sunday morning"
26815,1184926,3,delphinefs,04/05/2021,"Nice parking lot where we were able to stop for a night. Relatively clean, with a few trees and quite large. On the other hand, the road is right next to it which brings about a fairly constant background noise."
26815,1159068,3,makz49,28/03/2021,Has street next to it and party music in the evening. but well suited for an overnight stay and mostly clean

26815,1028706,5,Migosmultivan,06/09/2020,We stayed one night with the van. He made other vans and caravans. A small forest next to a housing estate. Quiet and beautiful place. perfect for sleeping.
26815,830501,5,lalalasheras,20/06/2020,We have spent the night and the truth that quite well. A group of young people in the distance. The road is close but traffic at night slows down a lot. We were able to let the puppies run around for a while.
26815,815906,3,Peluso01,03/06/2020,"Nice place, with tables, pine trees and shade. Good place to eat. We did not spend the night there."
26815,766688,3,josef_hajda,09/01/2020,The place is really close to the street. there are many large stones in the driveway and the driveway is very bad. I got a good fit (Knaus Suntraveller with Alko chassis). I drove again and didn't stay there.
26815,758964,4,vanlife.dreams.on4wheels,29/12/2019,The place is quite ok. you hear the street but you can sleep as well. at night will be much more calm. can imagine this place in the summer full because it's quite a lot of shade from the trees. some people coming at night and parking and than leaving..? no idea why
26815,747931,3,aledwarda,28/11/2019,Nice place to spend the night
26815,732507,3,jackborder,28/10/2019,"We spent the night from Sunday to Monday and although it was true that there was rubbish despite the trash present, we saw the next day the maintenance men make way for clean. Good road."
26815,720718,2,schnidens,13/10/2019,"Near the road. Crowded in the evening, better at night. But still, youth meet here to drink and play music. Would not recommend."
26815,720659,2,Vanhavenlife,13/10/2019,Very near to the road. While you can stay the night it is not a peaceful experience. Cars drive by all night and there are no fecilities not even a bin meaning there is rubbish everywhere. Weekends are also very busy early morning.
26815,702579,4,Seki07,24/09/2019,"Very wide place under trees, but next to the street. A little bit loud I the morning. But the rest was fine. I slept here for one night. No other car/camper was here"
26815,602275,5,mpiwons,05/08/2019,"Very nice calm place. We stayed during a Saturday/Sunday night. Some young people had a booze party, but the terrain is large so the were not disturbing. No services. Very shady. Quite flat."

26815,308451,1,Nana.psy,31/07/2018,Very high up on the mountain and far from everything. very narrow and winding roads. barely mastered by bus. View is wonderful
26815,261000,2,lowlow,30/05/2018,"This is not a place of nature but more a car park where you can hear a lot of the noise of cars, it has all the reasons of stress when there are cars and people who come right next to the van right in the middle of the road. night. Not very reassuring as a place, just fine for picnicking"
26815,247270,3,flower,06/05/2018,It helps out well and it's not so bad for a spot as ready for Barcelona. You can hear cars and planes passing by but earplugs had a good night's sleep.
26815,181341,4,Basyanis,21/08/2017,"A nice place where we even put up a tent for the end of the night. Well, it's not an isolated heavenly place. But, it does have picnic tables and it is not forbidden to park there. At two o'clock in the morning, there was a small group playing the guitar. It made us feel so good."
26815,166835,4,pandaontheroad,06/08/2017,"We spent the night here, quiet, quiet and well-ventilated. only negative note of the strange animals that we could not identify in the park, one was big enough, maybe sleeping with the doors open is not the best !!"
26815,154865,4,swap38,20/07/2017,"Beautiful space in a pine forest sparse. The part with the tables is delimited by rocks (but one of them at the bottom is easily removed). The other part where we stayed at night is closer to the road. There is a lot of daylight, but it is very quiet at night. No mosquitoes, no one else, not too hot, light breeze ... we slept very well! :-)"
26815,73500,2,YANNBZH,16/05/2016,Attention place of noisy night-time meetings some nights it is very regrettable
26821,1641914,3,F.Miranda,13/10/2021,"Popular barbecue area. Free bathroom. Good area to lunch or dinner. Has barbecue places, tables and chairs under big trees. Has a water fountain in front of this park. Bath rooms are big and it has a little place for children to play. On the other side of the road has an enormes park for maintenance. The night is quiet, but during week days, It is a safe place to park, police passes here often."
26821,778759,2,tdwesten,10/02/2020,"Nice view but no place to sleep. Lots of passing traffic during the day. The playground is nothing, just 1 seesaw and that's it. Nice to have lunch but we continue for a place to sleep"
26821,398408,3,Capturetheworld,24/10/2018,Very nice parking lot. Invites you to linger. Not staying here because we wanted to go further.
26821,114961,3,F.Miranda,25/11/2016,"Great view, but a lot of wind at night. Next to the road, it as a fountain of water, normal garbage and recycle garbage, toillets, picnic tables, free barbecue and a little childrens park at this spot. A lot of people day and night. Across the road there is a fitness track. It is a good spot to park but isolated in the mountain and forest ! Didn't like to sleep here."
26821,52009,1,musiquechris,25/08/2015,Parking very small and very busy. At the edge of the road so noisy
26827,3270296,4,laspescadillasviajeras,07/09/2023,"Nice area and close to the center, restaurants, bear trail, prehistory museum, routes, it has a green area with tables, garbage cans and level. At night it is super quiet even though it is close to the road. There is a bit of a mess with the organization of parking spaces. Notice tomorrow, September 9, 2023 from 9:00 a.m. you cannot park due to concentration of ac de Asturias."
26827,3252557,5,AdrianCotelo,03/09/2023,"Nice place to rest and start the routes, paid water services"
26827,3235643,5,mica2021,29/08/2023,"Correct and quiet area. Wide and flat. Quiet place to spend the night and enjoy the surroundings: Xanas Gorge, Senda del Oso... Guided tour of the Collegiate Church of San Pedro, don't miss it."
26827,3226803,5,besergiop,27/08/2023,"We have spent one night here. Everything clean and with restaurants nearby. The space between each square is respected. It is true that the ground curbs are laid out a bit strange to maneuver, but nothing major. They have a water tap for €1."
26827,3123682,4,judiju,11/08/2023,"Despite having many vans and motorhomes, it has been very quiet to spend the night. The only drawback is the disorganization of the car parks, difficult to understand and with very annoying curbs. The baker passes by in the morning with a very good product."
26827,3118563,4,pimpelb,10/08/2023,"large parking lot with many people. Slept several nights. Next to the track, but quiet at night. Playground available. You have to pay for water, but there is also a fountain in the village and you can get free water in the parking lot of Entrago, the neighboring village. Handy: the baker passes around 9:30 am!"
26827,3089551,4,Niculescus,06/08/2023,"The area is quite good, the parking lots are very disorganized but good to spend the night"

26827,3002693,4,zucche,22/07/2023,"Very nice place, quiet and with beautiful views. Beginning of the bear trail on the side. Services have to pay 1€ for 3 minutes of water, only to empty water. Pueblo full of restaurants! 5G Vodafone to work very good"
26827,2961655,5,Fyrst,14/07/2023,Extraordinary place to park and spend the night. You have to pay to recharge 3 m. There are also fountains a few meters away. You can spend the night and it is even worth staying for a few days. It has a park and a very fun zip line. In the town you eat very well and it has the Tasquita bar with very nice staff and a terrace to have a great drink.
26827,2940607,4,suyuju,09/07/2023,"Great, spectacular views of the mountains, Free discharge into 2 floor caskets in the filling/emptying area (it is not known which is for black and which is for grey), to fill €1 for 3 minutes of water. There is a picnic area with tables and swings. July on weekend free site. The road very well. Town 2 minutes walk. In the first bar going down to the right we feel almost at home"
26827,2855497,3,Kartoffelsuppe,15/06/2023,"Background noise from the street (cars, trekkers), cowbells, barking dogs from the village and barking dogs from the campers, church bells and from 7 a.m. the bus. supply costs; Disposal a bit confusing."
26827,2830093,3,LourdesIbarra,07/06/2023,"Quiet area, bad services because the white water for a fee of €1/3 minutes does not work. Two chests on the ground that you don't know if they are for gray or black. There is no water for toilet cleaning. The quiet town with the path of the bear to walk or bike and the park of prehistory about 3 km."

26827,2699072,4,Cristina.L.B.,26/04/2023,"quiet place near the town. The clean water service, €1 / 3 min. Black water can be emptied (there is none to clean the Poti), but there is no gray water."
26827,2647815,1,Fernandotkd,07/04/2023,"The situation is unfortunate, at least in Easter, the motorhome area, occupied by vans in a shanty town camp and the motorhomes outside the premises for not being able to use it unfortunate that someone does not take action on the matter"
26827,2641942,5,oscar50,05/04/2023,Good area with plenty of space. It lacks light since it has water to load and unload. Impressive views
26827,2564097,5,kascoxu,30/01/2023,"Shared parking with buses and cars. emptying area, black two chests on the ground, gray are a bit confusing, I did not understand, you may have to open the black chest and aim well. clean waters are paid. The area is located between two towns, La Plaza and San Martín. Be sure to visit Taberna Narciso. emblematic Asturian windlass, they usually have live music."
26827,2512793,4,kiki_joseph,04/12/2022,"The squares are a little inclined, we have slept three motorhomes, a very large space with free emptying. Has internet coverage"
26827,2482574,2,RamonKTF,04/11/2022,"The service area is a shame…one of the worst I have visited. They could delimit places suitable for the dimensions of the motorhomes, the same as there are for buses. Points in favor… the environment and the services that you can find in the town. Very improvable area with little expense and effort."
26827,2477938,4,Festin,01/11/2022,"Free area for overnight, water with cost, emptying of black and gray mixed in the floor grids. Near the town and lots of routes. Squares a bit confused with car parks, and with certain unevenness"

26827,2392721,1,rufach,22/09/2022,"Just arriving, people camping. Quite noisy place during the day, lots of traffic on a cobbled street. Besides, a dog from a nearby house barking all night. ALL NIGHT LONG. We do not recommend this site for anything."

26827,2287978,5,limonsin,23/08/2022,"Great Area, it has to change gray waters and the waters of water, it is wide and very calm. For the filling of water you have to pay with euro coins, 3 minutes away the place is great to eat Asturian food and drink the wonderful cider."

26827,2207116,5,ivannoe1980,09/08/2022,"Perfect for visiting the bear path area, next to a playground with a slide and grass, we dined at a nearby La Chabola restaurant also very well, and the town is a short walk away. A little strange the delimitation of squares but each one looks for his place"
26827,2187883,5,Rosaliveros,06/08/2022,"fantastic, level, the semi-cemented ground is appreciated if it rains because it is not asphalt nor does it make mud. A meadow with tables to the side to play with the dogs or the kids, and right next to the town with a good offer for tapas. A place to return to, without a doubt."
26827,2180241,5,Anaidd,05/08/2022,Excellent place to spend the night. Very quiet and in a spectacular setting. It is inside the town. I would definitely stay again. In Entrago the caravan site was complete and looked like a fair
26827,2140000,5,Goyitox,29/07/2022,"Very nice and quiet. It has black and gray. Water for one euro 3 minutes. Surrounded by nature and the town one step away. Recommendable. About 10 in the morning the baker appears. Great bread and sweets, the spectacular croissant."

26827,2118848,5,CamposCamper,24/07/2022,"Splendid views. Many thanks to the council. The town has several excellent places to eat. In the ""Tasquina"" you can shower or wash clothes for 3 euros. And also catch a blind man with cider from 15 hehe"
26827,2109562,4,Silcarfer,23/07/2022,"A very well kept area. Let's respect and make it even better. Playground next door and a couple of picnic tables. We had dinner at La Chabola Restaurant, behind the church, very tasty and in quantity. Very nice environment."
26827,2107755,3,kilyvlc,22/07/2022,"Good zone. It is true that it looks more like a park than a parking lot, and there are children doing what children do (shouting, running, with the ball, bicycles...), so it is not a place to rest (at least during the day)"
26827,2064409,4,Superchani,12/07/2022,"We only pass to empty gray water and collect water. The area seems quiet; The only drawback is that there is little shade. There are people who have made a mistake when emptying the sewage and, at the water intake, there are unpleasant surprises. Attention: both the gray and black ones must be emptied into the 2 hatches on the floor. Note: open them first!"
26827,2059099,3,RebecaNave,11/07/2022,Flat area with games for children and beautiful views. The water is paid and the fountain was full of sewage.
26827,2031747,4,Carlosfigura,02/07/2022,"The area is very good, but the people... I like to decide when to listen to music, and to get tables, chairs and for the children to play ball (right next to my motorhome) it is better to go to a campsite. It is a pity that civic people and that we comply with the rules do not let us sleep in depending on which sites and those who do not comply with them roam freely."
26827,2023507,3,seforaa,30/06/2022,lovely area in which to spend the night. all very quiet. but the services that appear in the description are not. there are other alternatives such as the village laundry and the showers at the local gas station...
26827,2008032,4,labeni,25/06/2022,Many thanks to the City Council. Very quiet area. The gray draining could have been done better by putting grids instead of a lid on the floor

26827,1974785,4,anaman,13/06/2022,"AREA with a good place to spend the night, very quiet and with emptying and water loading services (payment €1 x 3 minutes). The emptying area is a bit deficient and you have to point it out very well!"
26827,1947640,4,Sidrina,05/06/2022,"Quiet site. To one side there is a field esplanade with some tables. Despite having been on Saturday night, the only noise there was was that of the cow bells. the town a minute walk"
26827,1900880,4,laroutesansfin,19/05/2022,A mountain place far from everything. The calm and beauty of the place are its strong points.
26827,1890222,4,jc2655,14/05/2022,Very nice site. We spent two days and we were very calm. Zero noise and the town next door. I recommend
26827,1877096,4,Anaiat4,08/05/2022,"Quiet area, with many users. The emptying area is a bit scarce, it is a manhole, a small sewer. On Saturday night the Civil Guard passed by and ordered an AC to move that was blocking the way. Great to spend a quiet day in nature!"
26827,1875760,5,Paichi,07/05/2022,"The site is great, people don't understand it about not camping. It is a pity that for the rest the few privileges we have are taken away from us. We did the cave route, very cool. They also park cars despite the fact that it is an AC area. There is a specific space for the bus. On Saturday at 9 in the morning the baker passed by. Good product, do not stop buying. The townspeople are very friendly."
26827,1866562,3,FerdiVan21,02/05/2022,A good starting point for hikes. The night was calm. The disposal of grey-black water possible. You have to pay for water. It is difficult for the dog to find a place to clean up.
26827,1828013,4,viajamos,16/04/2022,"The area is great, there is a nice field of grass and the town in a plin with all the services. They should improve the sewage drainage, I have caught it clogged."
26827,1827503,5,Oviedo2008,16/04/2022,Perfect to spend the day and spend the night. The town two minutes walk. Quiet and with beautiful views.
26827,1826064,4,silvilanas,16/04/2022,"It is very good, but the limitation of parking is a bit messy, free emptying area and the filling area is paid. There is a green area right next to it with some tables or benches and a small park."
26827,1797812,5,daniyumpro,27/03/2022,"We loved the place for being quiet & safe and with such a view! You have to eat at Casa Laureano, is cheap and tasty, the best food that we tried in Asturia ❤️"
26827,1788149,5,manelpm,19/03/2022,"Quiet and safe area, perfect for the path of the bear path."
26827,1768394,1,Chilinoa,27/02/2022,We have stopped only to fill water and we are left without water and without euro. There was no sign of the malfunction or being out of service. I can't comment on the rest
26827,1754193,3,Dubardo,12/02/2022,"Today we are sleeping four ACs in this wonderful area of Plaza de Teverga and it is a pity that the water load is out of order. And Entrago's too. Teverga Town Hall, move around a bit, these areas are great and we feel very welcome."
26827,1738455,5,PelayoAlvarez,21/01/2022,"Good area to visit the municipality of Teverga. Quiet area, with all services at hand and in a spectacular environment! To put half a hit, a little light would be nice but otherwise great. Thanks to the people of Teverga for this area!!"
26827,1721527,5,nataliafp88,01/01/2022,"Perfect parking to rest and spend the day doing some of the routes that this environment offers you. It has a garden area next to it, with tables, a bar and an area for filling and emptying gray water (by lifting the lid). With a 7m motorhome you have to make maneuvers to park it a bit decently, since the parking is organized a bit strange and for smaller vehicles."
26827,1716126,4,urko64,26/12/2021,"very quiet area to sleep, good views and the town next door. highly recommended"
26827,1693225,3,euproctus,19/11/2021,"Flat area next to a road, very close to the village."
26827,1659834,4,Cel0403,24/10/2021,"Good parking, spacious and perfectly level, very good views, easy access with water service"
26827,1644781,5,isagu,14/10/2021,"Nice, clean area, playground for children, no problem with animals, picnic area, emptying and filling, the town two minutes walk where you will find what you need. impressive sights"
26827,1639598,4,irebor,11/10/2021,Good area with basic services and you can walk to town in 2 minutes.
26827,1639476,4,guau,11/10/2021,We have spent two very quiet nights. Both children and dogs have enough area to spread out.
26827,1638765,4,dvirpelao,11/10/2021,"Quiet place. We spent the night from October 10 to 11, 2021. Next to the bus area, there are the manholes for emptying. And water for 1 euro. It has a grassy area with picnic areas and a couple of slides. We put photos."
26827,1613902,4,Javito1971,28/09/2021,We were last 09/23/2021 spending the night in this area. We were 4 motorhomes and luxury !! The loading and emptying area without problems (€ 1 three minutes of water) the clean area although the passage of time is noticeable and a bit of neglect in the furniture. For the all very good . Restaurants and cafeteria walking and the sunrise looking at the mountains !! Good stop to start routes !!
26827,1578948,5,JuliaLiAr,14/09/2021,"We returned after 3 years because in its day we loved it. it is still very good, but there are too many motorhomes and the spaces are very narrow. Water now costs 1 euro, which I think is better because the exchange area looks cleaner than before. good place to do the bear path"
26827,1574668,5,Juanangarcia,13/09/2021,Large motorhome area a few meters from the town. With unbeatable views The squares are a bit messy but with a little organization as discussed below there is no major problem. € 1 three minutes of water. To fill and empty it is a bit strange since you have to lift some boxes that are on the ground and press the button that is in the fountain so that the water comes out of the drain.
26827,1572004,4,oskrcali,12/09/2021,"It is very good, a little messy the squares of good. Next to the town with everything you may need. In the morning the baker comes."
26827,1546339,5,Lotus63,04/09/2021,Beautiful CP with all necessary amenities and close to the pleasant town.
26827,1523836,3,XavierBertran,28/08/2021,"We parked next door, as the AC site was quite full. There is a lot of space and it is next to the town."
26827,1512370,4,eloigispert,25/08/2021,"Very well located area, large and with many squares. Water emptying is done using two unintuitive metal lids and is not easy when you have to empty the grays. You pay 1 euro for 3 minutes of water, it filled us almost 60 liters. I think it's perfect to contribute to more areas like this and help the municipalities that have them."
26827,1506647,5,llabiegu,24/08/2021,Comment that Teverga is a cattle area with a water deficit in the summers. I do not think that a free area gives rise to inappropriate parasitic behaviors of the majority of this group of trying not to pay 1 EURO and putting the car in a town to fill up for free in a fountain with a closed tap.
26827,1504217,5,Trufavan,23/08/2021,"Great area, incredible views. It is true that the distribution is a bit chaotic but with organization everything is saved. The baker comes in the morning with delicious things for breakfast."
26827,1487648,4,Toroblanco,20/08/2021,"There is a fountain past the collegiate church on the left, just around the bend in the road that goes up towards Redral."
26827,1481180,3,imazzius,19/08/2021,"Many squares, with a somewhat chaotic distribution. Some take out tables, chairs and set up camp, thank you for harming the group. To empty black and gray water, you have to lift metal covers from some boxes on the ground, it is not very intuitive / comfortable."
26827,1478823,5,Channelchallenger,18/08/2021,"Good area in the town, we have been two nights, one in the area and another night in the field opposite also very well, in the area with all services, € 1 3 minutes of water. Perfect to start the route of the bear path by bike"
26827,1477259,5,ancapo,18/08/2021,"Great area and very respectful people. The baker goes in the morning, she is charming and has very good products. Thank you for facilitating the stay, I will soon repeat as the area is beautiful."
26827,1463059,5,jonatanpardo,15/08/2021,Quiet area to sleep and do the Bear route. The Bear Route begins 1.2km from the area. We just sleep. We do not use the services. Parking lots are a bit weird. If you cannot find a place there is a large esplanade right in front where many ACs are placed.
26827,1456093,5,josecarmen,14/08/2021,"Area where you sleep very quietly. At 10 am the baker passes by with some delicious pastries. It is a few meters from the start of the bear path, so it is perfect to spend the night and do the route in the morning. Recommend the Aladino restaurant, delicious grilled and homemade menus. The best thing to do is go to the area in the morning, before 4 pm-5pm, which is when it starts to fill up."
26827,1454158,4,TelleriaEli,14/08/2021,He sleeps peacefully. enough places to park. town with all services within walking distance. There are municipal swimming pools. THE WATER FILLING IS NO LONGER FREE. € 1 - 3 min.
26827,1448765,3,jordi_284,13/08/2021,"Better this area to go to Senda del Oso than Entragu, which is full of climbers with vans and sleeper cars that are very noisy as a general rule. he sleeps peacefully."
26827,1447865,5,vanevalencia,13/08/2021,Nice place with a playground and the town next to it. It also has picnic tables and is very close to the bear path. Thanks to the city council for this initiative!
26827,1447525,3,franjgr,12/08/2021,"They have put the paid water, € 1 = 3 minutes. When you go for time you cannot stop to wash the Poti if you also want to carry water and I no longer tell you a jug of water. There is no difference between draining black and gray water, two exactly the same manhole covers that you have to lift and drive at the same time. Places designed for cars, which prevents good organization. More room in front"
26827,1443001,4,lolablanco,12/08/2021,"When you arrive you do not know how to wear it, why the squares are rare. To empty you have to lift a manhole cover. There is no noise at night other than the river and the garbage truck that passes at 7:30 Good to spend a night near the bear trail"
26827,1440571,4,jordi_284,11/08/2021,"Very quiet at night, 5 minutes by bike from the beginning of the Sensa del Oso."
26827,1434401,4,d.portillo,10/08/2021,"The place is correct although very crowded, we went to an adjoining wasteland next to the river. Emptying the water is very unintuitive, if I had not read in the application I would not have been able to empty the tanks."
26827,1431442,5,nachoviedo,09/08/2021,"Very beautiful place and with the town next to it, it has a lot of charm, in addition to all the services it has. the restaurants that are nearby are to try them all. the site is 10"
26827,1431101,5,Asuncionjuanj,09/08/2021,"A spectacular area. It has a water drain service, and the first squares have access to electricity. Just say that the road is quite winding, and narrow. But once you arrive you see that it is worth it, the town is 2 minutes away on foot and the people are super friendly. In the parking lot it is not very clear how to place the vehicle, but nothing special. The baker comes by around 10 in the morning."
26827,1430547,4,alecordie,09/08/2021,"I loved the place, quiet, there is another type of more respectful Camper, but what left me sad is that there are people or colleagues who occupy more than one parking lot. As of the date I write, the area is full ... very close to town ..."
26827,1415066,5,Yojonube,06/08/2021,"We liked this car park more than the one in Entrango, quieter and in a different environment, you can load water and empty gray and black (open the registration cover for gray and black, if not the emptying goes to the field). The central squares are small but if you can park at the back, the large ACs fit in well. Thanks to the city council for the services. The environment is very beautiful, hiking, biking, tourism, gastronomy."
26827,1401545,5,beticoluis,04/08/2021,"super quiet area. not many plots. don't eat breakfast soon, wait for the baker and his cakes."
26827,1395201,5,BinaWa,02/08/2021,"Thanks to Teverga for the pitch: close to the street, but quiet at night. It is almost empty during the day, but it gets busier in the afternoon and it can get very crowded in the evening. Stayed 3 nights: many hiking trails (reserve with bison, camino de oso on foot or with the mountain bike, which you can also rent) and also racing bike routes (puerto de San Lorenzo, La Ventana, Marabio ..), shops, bars."
26827,1384371,5,sarandonga,31/07/2021,Area with gray loading and unloading zone. Many squares and quite level. Surrounded by green and a Pueblo park a few meters away with many services. Added to favorites
26827,1321723,3,Moreyyo,13/07/2021,"Parking a little uneven but in good condition, with correct water services. Good situation in terms of proximity to a town with various services (restaurants, mini-supermarkets, etc). We arrived at noon and quiet but in the afternoon it became crowded and there was too much noise with people not very recommended, little respect for others, loose dogs etc. We left and did not spend the night."
26827,1319415,4,tusiku,13/07/2021,"Area right next to the town, quiet, flat and with all services"
26827,1314612,5,JotaCePe,11/07/2021,"Very well planned area, next to the town, with all services and beautiful views. We don't sleep, so I don't know if the proximity to the road bothers us. The only downside is that there is a common tap to fill and wash potty ..."
26827,1303443,5,Damaker,07/07/2021,"Area right next to the town with a lot of nature, we went for one night and we were 2, many shops in the town and restaurants !!! all services for filling and emptying !! 100% recommended"
26827,1244734,5,tarielbea,09/06/2021,"A beautiful place, surrounded by nature. picnic area, children's games, water point and emptying and the baker goes to the area in the mornings to sell products."

26827,1233619,4,mafo111,03/06/2021,quiet area to spend the night with the town next door with many restaurants and services ..... fully operational filling and emptying services although I miss an independent tap for each thing since there is only one and if it is used for both ... .....
26827,1223139,5,SaraSantoa,28/05/2021,"Beautiful place with a great view to the mountains to spend the night. Close to Senda del Oso, a beautiful trail along the canyon that you can’t miss (easy to ride the bicycle). There’s plenty of trails nearby. Great restaurants nearby with very nice staff."

26827,1149171,4,fransousa,09/03/2021,"Very quiet area, good for parking. It passes the road close by but the noise is not noticeable. Park the bus that starts early. To do the Senda del Oso I recommend the Entrago car park since it starts right. Town 2 minutes walk."
26827,1088295,5,madeinroadvan,10/10/2020,"It is an Area not a camping, to spend the night great. We went with the van and spent a very quiet night, the people of the town are very nice and especially the girl from the bakery."

26827,1061375,3,BeaCant,20/09/2020,Busy but pleasant place. The filling did not work but near the church there was a fountain that made paper.
26827,1049298,5,KIKEK2,15/09/2020,"We were there today. Spectacular place. quiet, with more ac and stunning views. Gray and black water drainage. The refilling water worked properly. The best restaurants Casa Laureano (pots, bean stew, wild boar ... homemade vomited in general) and Aladino (stone-grilled meat and sausage rablade). Both recommended by a local friend. Sure hit."
26827,1048352,3,legcat,14/09/2020,"In August, the area is very crowded, it is a bit chaotic as it is organized for parking... it does not work for filling water... thanks to the city council for the initiative but it needs a little maintenance."
26827,1047779,5,ManuAngyy29,14/09/2020,"We spent a splendid night with more caravans, with a good atmosphere in the parking lot and incredible views. There are bars, pharmacies nearby... everything very close at hand. In fact, there is a fountain where you can refill water and a park for children to entertain themselves."
26827,1027795,3,MSOUTO,05/09/2020,"After being in Entrago I came to this area, as of today it only has downloads. Close to the town with many services... I arrived at six in the afternoon there were three motorhomes but in the end it was full."
26827,1021042,4,ToniGarcia,02/09/2020,Super quiet area and correct services.
26827,1011963,2,Armando1,29/08/2020,"To say that initiatives of this type are always appreciated to the municipalities but the area is, in my opinion, very poor, the water does not work, the drains are deficient and the sites are narrow and poorly used. Luckily in the town we ate very well and at a good price. By the way, be careful where you park those who carry large motorhomes and although it does not put anything anywhere apparently next to the emptying there are three places that belong to the bus I repeat although it is not signposted anywhere"
26827,993626,5,rebecaal,23/08/2020,Very quiet area. We had two perfect nights. Very quiet at night. There is a swimming pool near (the town) to spend the afternoon after the trail and shower if you want.
26827,981641,3,Pataka,19/08/2020,It is very crowded. There was no space but you could park on a dirt esplanade in front.
26827,975160,3,AinhoaGG,17/08/2020,"Many caravans but quiet and clean. It has to empty gray and black water and now because of the covid they have cut the water. I recommend eating at Casa Laureano. Do the bear path by bike. The Entrago car park has more services, but much noisier and dirtier. beautiful views."
26827,967903,4,mismacondicion,16/08/2020,"We arrived on the afternoon/evening of 8/15/2020, packed to capacity but there was a mini-space left for our minivan. near the village. level parking."
26827,964160,5,toijarta,15/08/2020,"Thanks to the city council for this area. Although the water filling is still damaged, it is much better than the one in Entrago, which is too crowded. It is better to walk the km that leads to Entrago to start the bear route there. It fills up early so try to get there early, although there is more space for a few other ACs on a lot in front if the area is full."
26827,963174,3,davalgum,14/08/2020,The water does not work
26827,962401,2,dmas,14/08/2020,"Super crowded, I couldn't park. Some lighting with an awning and some chairs occupying seats. Queue at the drain. We'll see how this area turns out."
26827,960940,3,Doteo,14/08/2020,"Quiet area, good views, crowded, no water due to breakdown, very close to the town. Some do not comply with the rules, a few cannot remove tables or awnings, in the end the areas will be closed to us. Thanks to the city council for making it easier for us."
26827,927251,4,Deivy81,04/08/2020,"Currently it has the filling service without faulty, it can only be emptied and it is not too good. The area, more than an area is a parking lot. We spent the night perfectly very quiet and with a very good atmosphere. The site is nice."
26827,925740,3,Maria82,03/08/2020,Very crowded parking lot so we had to look for another option...
26827,921767,5,lachabola,02/08/2020,"The drinking water filling service is broken, you can fill your tanks in the fountain next to the La Chabola restaurant next to the Collegiate Church. The gray and black water emptying service is still operational."
26827,921607,3,vallilli,02/08/2020,Good area but we couldn't stay it was full.
26827,915859,4,Mayoamo,31/07/2020,"More than an area, it is a parking lot with emptying services, but the place is strategic to do the route of the bear path, and close to bars and food stores. We spent the night last night and you have to cover yourself with a sheet, so perfect to be on these dates."
26827,908038,3,annayoscar,28/07/2020,"Very small and crowded area. Very strategic to do the Senda de Oso. Glued to the road but sleeps well. Only gray water discharge, cannot load water. Swings and picnic tables next door. A lot of piss paper by the river ... a little please"
26827,907398,3,Alberto7.7,28/07/2020,"We have been in this area and there is no water. And they send you to the next one and there's no water either. In addition, a somewhat abrupt neighbor did not say that we should go there. So to sleep and empty well."
26827,900077,3,gachero,26/07/2020,"Large and quiet area, near the town. The gray and black download is a little complicated, it is the point to improve, even so many thanks to the city council for thinking of us"
26827,887249,3,isispring,21/07/2020,"The area is very good, what I do not see that black water can be emptied is only for gray and filled with drinking water, what if I want to add is that while waiting to empty there was a huge pool of water from people who do not care That its gray waters enter the drain and also emptying the pottys we go disgustingly after we complain that we have no place for ourselves."
26827,886809,3,Titopomi,21/07/2020,Next to the town and the bear route. Practical but very crowded
26827,886339,4,zuripunki,21/07/2020,"Quiet place, with the necessary services and in a strategic point to do different activities. To put a but, it is always of ourselves, cigars and cigarette butts on the floor, I am not pregnant with smokers but rather dirty."
26827,878791,5,miguelfranco2,18/07/2020,The area is wonderful. It is a pity that many motorhomes forget that this is not a picnic area or a campsite. Many outdoor tables and chairs that should not be seen in one area.
26827,869669,5,Egosurf,14/07/2020,"Free and with services of emptying and filling of water. Very quiet and close to the town where we had dinner at Laureano's house, the cachopo was delicious. We have made the bear path with the maquila adventure company, very nice .... We have also visited the prehistoric park, it is cool ..."

26827,857960,4,abcarnero,09/07/2020,"Very good area attached to the town with many services and an incredible view of the mountains. Stop to eat and rest. Later we spent the night since it is quieter, with less traffic noise than the recreational area from where the bear trail takes place."
26827,853739,3,Catalina19,07/07/2020,"We just stop in this area to empty and fill, these services are free and fine. easy access. level squares. Attached to the national highway. It has a picnic area with tables and a couple of slides."

Tables to eat (it is forbidden to take tables, but it is not necessary with the number of tables there are), bathrooms, playground for children, emptying of gray water.

26897,644981,3,KKF,20/08/2019,"We have spent the night quiet and without noise. It is a clear field, there is nothing. There were only two cars and a van. The directions are not very clear but when you are in the area it is easy to see. Near the municipal swimming pool."

26906,97115,3,gon943,19/08/2016,"This is the second year we are, it is worth the place, to see what it takes, near the beach, little tourism, quiet place, nearby supermarket, beach bar and restaurant."

I just appreciate being able to bathe in the pool because it was very hot!!! The restaurant had lousy service and the food left a lot to be desired… Lots of flies! The entire van was filled with flies!!! We won't be back…"
26940,2215540,2,flototoro,11/08/2022,"Emergency campsite for us, the others being full… The site is not bad, trees, with grass but the sanitary facilities are uncomfortable and dirty, the shop only sells drinks and the water was not drinkable during our stay. We paid €46 for a van, four people and electricity, so very poor value for money."
26940,375217,1,colyn,16/09/2018,"We were charged €35 for one night, motorhome 2 adults and 2 dogs. So over priced!! Hot showers finish at 8pm   Sink area locked. Showered in the morning hot water until 10am. Ladies showers were dirty, smelt grim, water unable to regulate so got too hot to stand under. On leaving emptied toilet cassette and no water turned on to tap to rinse. would not recommend at all for the price!!"
26940,322059,1,ishtar,08/08/2018,"Not possible to park4night price. They charge 30euros. Going down to the plots is very steep , with a 7 meter Motorhome very risky. Skipped it and went to Jaca st the city parking. Great place. Up the stairs from the park and you are in the old city. Full of bars and restaurants. Did not enjoy ""taberna gallega ladepili"""

26997,860133,5,CarlsonvomDach,11/07/2020,"Very quiet, very accessible with VW bus. Beach is great for surfing when the waves are small and there is no other spot (tip from a local!). To surf, just follow the path towards the cliffs at the end of the parking lot, where you can step straight into the lineup from the flat stones."
26997,849820,5,vaninou,05/07/2020,"Splendid location overlooking the beach, with a breathtaking view and sunset. fitted out vehicles Prohibited but tolerated with daily police visit. We were checked but they were very friendly explaining that we could only do one night. we loved it!"

26997,747486,4,bldwrk,26/11/2019,Currently (late November) a bit uneven and partly muddy. But the views and serenity compensate for everything. ?

26997,723540,5,Tofukind,17/10/2019,"Beautiful place for one / two nights. Well visited and partly came late campers, but otherwise quiet. On an exit you get to the beach and if the torrent allows, even to a toilet. Showers were no longer available in October, as on most beaches in the area. Great view. No problems with police or similar"

The police came in the evening, but pointed out friendly that camping is prohibited, but overnight would be no problem. The place is very nice for VW bus and co, campers get in trouble because there is hardly any room to turn etc. All in all, highly recommended."
26997,635179,2,phinie88,16/08/2019,"Nice place, but far too many people buses and RVs. People do not stick to the given areas on the edge of the way. When we were there, the last vans parked the way, so you could not get away in the morning. Not recommended in high season."
26997,594287,3,SurfnPincho,03/08/2019,"Very nice spot, not for sleeping if you have a roof tent/ pop up roof- got woken up by the police and were asked to leave. Didn’t get a fine."
26997,570978,4,birling,23/07/2019,"A very nice place and a superchula beach, ideal with the little ones. There is a very nice beach bar too. The police are waiting for nothing and looking at the raised ceilings. They told me to keep the chair very kindly."
26997,551972,5,gsonic,13/07/2019,"A beautiful place, but even during the day the local police has arrived at siesta time to tell us that it is forbidden to raise the roof. We did not have anything else outside. They do nothing but patrol by looking and calling attention to the van."
26997,550530,5,dontpanic,12/07/2019,"One of the best places in the whole coast, really impressive. In summer (and weekends) it is quite full, yes. The police pass, but if they do not remove awnings, tables, chairs, they do not say anything. Do not leave trash (""mines"" and toilet paper either ...) and respect the environment, which is a real privilege to be able to sleep in places like this, and it's up to us to continue allowing it :)"
26997,539295,5,MarieB100,05/07/2019,A very nice place. Stand alone at the parking lot. Had no problems with the police.

Flat parking, plenty of space to turn around. We didn’t see any police. Easy path down to the beach and to access headland rocks. Stayed here for 1 night, absolutely beautiful!"
26997,385617,4,DKRoadtrip,01/10/2018,"Very nice view, great sunsets. Small walk down to the beach, there is a working beach shower and a toilet. Bay and sandy beach were perfect for a beach day! The police comes by almost every day, but only kindly points out that camping is not allowed and things that are outside must be cleared, otherwise no penalty oä!"

26997,329321,4,JulieMU,12/08/2018,"Great view. Very nice place. Many vans and camper (about thirty), but quite quiet atmosphere (yet a Friday evening of August). Beautiful sunset. Possibility to go a little further than the parking. few flat places. The police spend the morning at 7:30 to arrange / remove everything that is ""camping"". For us, withdrawal of the holds, but we can continue the night. Despite the camp / cc ban sign, the police remain tolerant as long as there is no installation. (Cc 7,5m + bicycle door and it passes without problem)"
26997,315944,3,tainavikimike,05/08/2018,"Spot super beautiful, even more if you continue a hundred meters on the path after parking where you can park above the ocean. Chairs, tables however forbidden"
26997,308091,1,bbggcc,31/07/2018,"The site itself is impressive, it is worth going to spend the day. Yesterday the police passed in the afternoon calling attention to the ""campers"" (chairs, tables, chocks ...). After that, around 12 o'clock at night, the support staff of the local police arrived, threatening to fine and had everyone go down to the parking lot on the beach (which has the same sign of not camping as the one above)."
26997,301571,4,JeanneGreg,26/07/2018,Nice place with fast but muddy beach access. Passage of the police at night: do not leave anything outside under penalty of being woken up. Despite any nice spot
26997,295619,4,Drosses,21/07/2018,"Good place, quite level. The police pass at lunchtime and remind campers that you can not remove chairs, tables, etc. It also draws attention to an AC by having the window raised."

26997,270845,1,laurali,18/06/2018,"We were broken today, while we were on the beach, so parking space is not recommended, except maybe when several cars are there (we were the only)"
26997,232023,3,cesarast,01/04/2018,The slope is very bad and especially if it has rained. It's very narrow for two cars. A bit sinister place to sleep. I give the three stars just for the views there are.
26997,186015,5,tximix,27/08/2017,"We had no trouble having a nightmare on the night and day. There is a shuttle to the beach. Spectacular place to spend the day and overnight, we did not have any problem, and there was no guard. From the parking lot there is a walk that takes you to the beach."
26997,183463,5,sumafi,23/08/2017,"Beautiful area. Do not take out the camping equipment: rounds of local police and civil guardia during the day and evening. A detail: the forest behind the site turns into a toilet quickly in the summer, if we can not do otherwise why not but there are ways that it does not see too much, right? bury, get away from the path etc. Thank you"
26997,175566,3,uligolou,15/08/2017,"Very beautiful spot. Do not hesitate to continue the dirt road after parking. On the other hand, I confirm not to raise the roof of the calif. The Guard passed at 11:30 pm and asked us to close it. Being at 4, we all folded up and went to lose ourselves in a village in the middle of the earth to finish our night."

26997,92042,4,Amaury66,10/08/2016,"The spot is worth seeing at the end of the path that goes to the right of the surf school at the exit of Galizano. watch the guardia civil prowl and remind the ban on the holds for motorhome ... small path that leads to the beautiful beach of Galizano. snack, shower, wc. also go for a walk on the coastal path that continues, it climbs properly."

My spouse came out and saw a figure fleeing up the hill. We left"
27008,1636674,5,miamorais,10/10/2021,"Very calm place to stay, you will feel connected with nature. We were here alone, with no one around, only in the morning someone came for the bbq. Although it is wonderful beautiful and quiet be prepared for the facilities to be closed having no access to water, at least during low season. It was closed when we arrived and in the morning but we came around 8h30pm on Saturday and could be that the bar is shut on Sundays - not sure. Will come back."

27008,1421422,5,roadtripper1201,08/08/2021,Very nice in the middle of nature! The river is cold but you can swim in it. The owner of the restaurant was nice and he kept the toilets and showers open all night. Really very idyllic. Gladly again!
27008,761307,5,Raggiodisole56,01/01/2020,"Great quiet place. We were there with our van at the end of December. Access by small winding roads. Once there, a lot is located overlooking a small river. No service at this time, but there appears to be a restaurant that may be open seasonally. Barbecues and water tap on site. Perfect for a peaceful night. Very cold though. Travel at the end of December."

There is even a small house to rent next to the restaurant that we could visit, it's good to know for transients who do not have a camper."

27008,386686,5,Wohnmobilpeter,03/10/2018,"Wonderful spot! you can swim in the little water hole which is extremely cold and refreshing. Or you can do a wonderful and very enjoyable hike following the yellow and red marks starting next to the toilet. It is an 8 km hike through wonderful scenery, following the river up to the villages of Fresulfe and Dine, passing amazing big chestnut trees and wonderful panoramic viewpoints."

27008,356040,4,AraleNoriMakina,27/08/2018,"It's not bad but it's no wonder, the access road is long, winding and narrow, there are areas so narrow that if two vehicles coincide there are problems, the night esplanada is small, the bar service very good people very friendly and helpful , the night is calm since the people who are going to spend the day leave, the beautiful but debatable environment to bathe in that stretch of river."
27008,340991,5,darwin0612,18/08/2018,A real happiness this place. the road to get there is not easy and I think the site will be inaccessible for most CC.

The weather was not good for swimming, but a magical place. PS: notice to the owner, if you sell or stop the activity, made us sign. ;)"

27012,3196480,5,l2pdtf,21/08/2023,"Very nice place despite the road above, very accessible with a 6.40m van. No wind and mosquitoes for us. Pleasant swimming. Very quiet in the evening."
27012,2694226,5,framiri,24/04/2023,"Small correction: the place can be reached without a 4x4. A concrete runway leads directly to the spur/Kl. Peninsula. There are tables and benches and terraced storage space. Just a great place for swimming. Unfortunately, the road is always present."
27012,2678421,5,Eric76230,18/04/2023,Beautiful area. A great night with our van. Had no issues with mosquitoes. The road is far enough away not to pose a real problem. Access is a concrete path. There is just at the end of the concrete path a quite significant drop which may be awkward for fairly long motorhomes.
27012,2420629,3,NancyBronchart,03/10/2022,"Quite a lot of noise, a highway passes by and flies galore. No shade. Picnic table"
27012,2324083,5,RRRaquela1994,31/08/2022,"The place is impressive, in a very quiet environment. It is true that you can hear a little noise from cars in the distance but nothing disturbing. The stars and the milky way can be seen amazing. Enjoy a lot!"
27012,2126014,5,kathaxr,26/07/2022,"Very nice view and sunset. The lake is perfect for a short cool down. You can hear the highway at night, but I don't think it's that bad."
27012,2120091,4,kekoyAle,25/07/2022,Very good place to spend the day paddle surfing and water sports. It has no services. He sleeps well. The navigator sends you by mistake on a very dangerous road with sand and you can get stuck with the caravan. You get off directly from the n122a parallel to the national road along a paved road. There is a dumpster
27012,2072258,2,elhinchon,14/07/2022,"watch out! We spent an afternoon and noticed that there was a man watching us behind some stones and bushes. we were alone, and this man was constantly hiding to ""spy"" on us. It seemed very strange to us... we have notified the Civil Guard and they have told us that they have already reported a similar case. nothing happened to us, but we didn't like that attitude at all... the place is beautiful, the beach too"
27012,1774883,5,doezi,06/03/2022,"Wonderful place. We were all alone here and slept peacefully and safely. We recommend. Pure nature, therefore zero facilities, but a lot of landscape."
27012,1761547,5,fergraus,20/02/2022,"very quiet to spend the night, with great views. The cars can be heard a little when stepping on the bridge of the nearest road, but it is not annoying. In the morning the civil guard passed by but they didn't tell us anything. I recommend it"
27012,1603270,4,AsierGarciaAlvarez,23/09/2021,"A beautiful place that you can visit if you are passing through. I have spent the night there and it is very good, although the wind is blowing. By the way, the road is paved (not super good, but it is). It is only a small final section that is not, but the van is good for you if you go quietly, since it is only a few meters."
27012,1484129,5,naima004,19/08/2021,Very nice spot with nice view of the lake! Rather calm and accessible to all types of vehicles. (slight noise from the road for sensitive ears) Perfect place to spend a quiet night!
27012,1471047,4,katarsis,17/08/2021,Very quiet place and zero noise. With enough space. Be careful because the GPS sends you down an unpaved dirt road and it is wrong. The road is paved and you get there super fast.
27012,1469507,1,ringostarkey,17/08/2021,Authentic ecological disaster. Iberdrola emptied at night and treachery the reservoir up to 11% of its capacity to generate electricity in its turbines at the time of the highest price of electricity in our country. Now a secarral for pure speculation. We had visited it last year and it was heaven. Hopefully he recovers to his previous state. It's a huge shame :-(

27012,1115645,4,fabiscamperlife,16/11/2020,Really nice place. Except the motorway is a little bit disturbing. And it can get windy. There are a lot of spots to stay and its also no problem to get there without a 4x4
27012,1030076,5,cesarmarcosmorate,06/09/2020,"A spectacular site, the access seems bad, but it is done very well. In summer a lot of people come, but there is plenty of room for everyone. We will return without hesitation."

27012,504905,1,RoLiTi,05/06/2019,Attention - category changed: at the end of the driveway comes a sandy track with a steep incline. We did not come up with our rather small motor home and turning was extremely tedious.
27012,499312,2,papou74,01/06/2019,"Nice view, but dirty many papers and others, and noise from the road above, very average restaurant"

27012,475097,5,M.Balmert,03/05/2019,A beautiful spot! The lake is great and the sunsets are awesome? This place invites you to linger longer. From me at this point 1000 times thanks for the discoverer.
27012,469900,4,Christianedubois,28/04/2019,"This place should not become a motorhome parking area. To be preferred for vans only. Respect the premises please. Beautiful place: benches for eating, swimming possible, calm and beautiful view."

The road/bridge is a bit noisy in the daytime but everything else is great.

27014,3041811,5,ronnie26,29/07/2023,Stunning spot in the mountains by a refreshing stream (if you’re brave enough to go in - it’s sharp!) No reception but who needs it when nature provides all the entertainment? Had one very peaceful night here all to ourselves and would definitely recommend.

27014,706964,3,capijari,28/09/2019,Beware of the humidity level! Very very humid. Stand in the morning sun.
27014,654729,5,_SEV_,23/08/2019,"Place near the road (not much busy), but hidden and very quiet. Great night in the forest by the creek"
27014,557521,4,MarieVPierreL,16/07/2019,"Very winding access road but easy place to find. Very nice, quiet and relaxing with the sound of the stream that passes below. Shaded place in the hollow of a valley so we are well cool, provide warm clothes."
27014,445459,5,mountainman85,27/03/2019,"Fantastic, hardly saw another vehicle all night and the stream is lovely. A little cold at this time of year though!"
27014,345367,4,blaclau,20/08/2018,"Easy access place. Be careful, sharp turn when coming from Elizondo. Shaded so ideal for summer, and very nice stream against low. We can swim there. We were 2 vans on the spot."
27014,328924,4,bouffonnasse,12/08/2018,27/07/2018 Super spot for the night. Far from even phone relays. alone in the world.
27014,325327,4,rasmango,10/08/2018,Really calm with beautiful little river to cool off
27014,317209,4,vic85,06/08/2018,"Great area, very nice. I recommand it."
27014,311918,1,boro999,02/08/2018,"Access completely overgrown. Street also very narrow, rather only with a small van. We are back, unfortunately ..."
27014,248339,4,lagadou93,08/05/2018,No convenience but very very quiet in the heart of the Pyrenees
27014,227338,4,vfrmania,13/03/2018,Location near the road but very little passage in early March. The river is very nice. Pay attention to the access when it rained if you are in 2 wheel drive. Spot in my opinion super nice summer between the river and the shade brought by the trees with the opportunity to land in groups of 2 to 3 vehicles.
27014,169603,5,jobeagal,09/08/2017,"Superb quiet night, very nice place."
27014,91287,4,ovni,08/08/2016,"Beautiful secluded but quiet place, children bathed."
27027,3252616,3,Vikcente,03/09/2023,"Unbeatable location with fantastic views. In my opinion it costs more than what it offers, but it is the only place to spend the night that has drainage services. Very close to the port and shopping/restaurant area. Very clean bathrooms. I didn't find the staff very friendly, although we all have a bad day. Motorhome, 3 pax and electric. = €53. It does not support only services. We spent the night on 08/23/2023"
