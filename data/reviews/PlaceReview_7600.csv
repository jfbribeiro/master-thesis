102707,3154064,4,EnekoZabalza,15/08/2023,"It is a roundabout as the end of the road in an area that seems to be urbanized in the future. We slept perfectly one night, without noise and with a great view of the sea. It does not have any services and is quite horizontal. From there Cala en Brut and Pon Gil are relatively close (by bike in 10 minutes)."
102707,1530310,1,Brucete,30/08/2021,"It only serves to see views, it is like a roundabout, it serves for the night, I would say something dangerous. In the vicinity better"
102707,1415386,5,sergisampons,06/08/2021,Lovely views along the street. Perfect to watch the sunset but you have to go early because a lot of people go. Quiet place with a sea breeze that is great to cool off the night.
102707,550264,5,xssanti,12/07/2019,Very quiet place with beautiful views!
102740,3256773,5,puercopato,04/09/2023,"Uncovered and in line on the road. For campers, vans and cars."
102740,2679242,5,jmleston,18/04/2023,we parked during the morning and afternoon and there was plenty of space. but we didn't sleep there
102740,2626177,3,Hannedr,27/03/2023,"Easy to reach, but it is a very narrow parking strip that takes you over the road for a while. We quickly drove on again."
102740,2606537,3,chantaldante,12/03/2023,Convenient to visit this beautiful village. Lots of people and buses. I recommend this tour. We returned to Nerja.
102740,2605856,5,pamadama,11/03/2023,"Great place to visit Frigiliana, free in March. You have to arrive early (9.00) to catch a place. Really great playground for kids just 250m away at the roundabout. Fantastic spanish Tapas in restaurant Nueva Tahona (same 250m), excelent quality both 4 years ago and today."
102740,2592772,5,bactrian50,27/02/2023,Excellent parking to visit the beautiful village. We arrived 9.00 am on a Monday and there was loads of spaces but a couple of hours later it was full.
102740,2557247,5,camper_stan,21/01/2023,Arrived here at 10am on a Saturday and parked without issue although every space was full when I return later in the day. Spent the night in Nerja.
102740,2478843,4,wolfkorn,02/11/2022,The parking lot is ideal for larger motorhomes as it is reserved for 6 large vehicles. But you have to be very lucky to get a free place.
102740,1821404,3,JJALM,14/04/2022,"Perfect to visit the town, but very inclined. Very nice town."
102740,1781770,5,TinaLintz,13/03/2022,"Free, perfect for visiting the pretty town of Frigiliana! Along the road."
102740,1741893,4,fred.voyage,26/01/2022,"Good parking space along the road, just look out when you drive there, turn the roundabout and then drive into the right place. Short distance to town."
102740,1741082,5,luciekx,25/01/2022,Perfect to visit the city
102740,1726021,4,qingqing,04/01/2022,"Roadside parking. Always busy.  We came at one Sunday and we couldn’t get a park place, so we left. We came back the next morning, luckily there was place that big enough for our long Campervan. Suggest that if you want to visit the beautiful town please come in the morning time for secure a parking place."
102740,1712586,5,RocioMG,19/12/2021,"perfect parking to visit the town, we travel by van and it stays right on the parking line, for motorhomes there is a parking lot for heavy vehicles higher up where we have seen some parked"
102740,1706358,4,MariClaire,08/12/2021,"Parking on both sides of the road. It is recommended to visit Frigiliana, which is worth it."
102740,1704762,3,zurix,06/12/2021,Parking 10 minutes walk from the center of Frigiliana. A town that is definitely worth seeing.
102740,1669199,5,smeetjeee,30/10/2021,Great place to park for the day to visit the city. If you come around 10am there is enough parking space. Around 12 it will get busier. Big enough parking spaces for our 6m van.
102740,1636026,2,tisky,10/10/2021,"Cars go too fast on the road, we were unlucky when one hit us in the rear view mirror."
102740,1607193,5,ralena,25/09/2021,Parking lot directly on the access road to the village. Exactly suitable for a van. We also got a place on a weekend.
102740,1602810,4,mieric,23/09/2021,"Ideal and only parking to visit the village, and it is really worth it ... Do not arrive too late ..."
102740,1540052,4,Guakamole,02/09/2021,You have to go first thing in the morning because if you don't you can't find parking. We were only during the day. Very long parking.
102740,1461559,3,Raul,15/08/2021,For such a beautiful town it is the only option there is to park motorhomes
102740,1393407,3,jorgerif,02/08/2021,"Parking on this entrance slope, which is almost the only option that exists to park and visit the town with the car. It is close to the town to walk up perfect"
102740,1370598,5,Evacorval,27/07/2021,"Lovely town, parking right at the entrance, perfect for visiting"
102740,1362590,4,rivera89,25/07/2021,"Quiet, the town is worth visiting"
102740,1201364,1,Shecka,16/05/2021,We managed to stay one night but the next morning we were told that Frigiliana is forbidden for campers / motorhome owners etc. ..... :) ok wow.
102740,1174300,1,lacamp20,16/04/2021,"We were dislodged at 8:00 p.m. by the police who told us that the whole town was forbidden to spend the night. No problem, we will visit the village the next day, but we will take care not to spend € 1 there."
102740,1159800,1,Mingor,28/03/2021,"The local police told me that I was camping with my shoes, I told them that if they don't like us, don't worry, and I left."
102740,1134244,5,markadmson,31/01/2021,You don't need to park right on this spot. there is parking all the way down this road and flatter further down. Great place to spend at least one day and night lovley pretty town. bar that does beer and tapas for €1 and some lovely restaurants. well worth a visit.
102740,1090781,2,airebears,12/10/2020,"Roadside, unlevel but free parking, 5 minutes walk to centre - this has become a very popular spot during 2020 (I live in the village) At the roundabout at the entrance to the village (with ""Frigiliana"" letters on) take the third turning (NOT 2nd - it's very tight in large vehicles) and go to next roundabout and come back on yourself. Wouldn't be surprised if this is gone by 2021."
102740,1072476,4,jesushinojo,27/09/2020,"Something annoying the noise of the cars, the GC passed and did not tell us anything, we spent the night without problems"
102740,1022688,4,pepk,03/09/2020,"A little inclined but perfect to visit the town, quite a few cars pass at night"
102740,1019704,3,Jasalop,01/09/2020,I give it 3 stars because Frigiliana is one of the most beautiful towns in Malaga. It is a must see. And because we are well received. There is no police chase for parking. The parking lot is quite steep. Perhaps almost all the way down it is flatter. You have to stick it to the maximum so that it does not stand out. And the passage of cars is continuous from 7.00am to 1.00am.
102740,980965,4,adribarbeito,19/08/2020,"We parked during the day, without problems. It really is the only viable site for a CA"
102740,785470,3,Priscila2020,23/02/2020,Area near the historic center 10 minutes walk ... many parking lots ... We have not slept but to spend the day and visit the great town
102740,770337,3,alhucemar,19/01/2020,"It is good to visit the town that is very beautiful, although they are narrow and the motorhome or large van stands out, there is traffic and some slope. I have not slept."
102740,755338,5,eburton,20/12/2019,"We preferred this spot to the other one, seemed more out of the way and in the evening there was less traffic. Beautiful views and frigiliana is a must to visit! There are some level places, but they were fine for our little camper. Toilets are open until 10ish which is opposite the indoor parking. This spot is next to an avocado grove...so we had a little treat! We stayed 2 nights in December with no problems. There is a market in town on Thursday. Make sure you wander around the old town, and visit the nearby Rio chillar."
102740,745331,5,SteveW,20/11/2019,Very quiet and quite level. Two nights spent here. Perfect stay in the beautiful village of Frigiliana.
102740,743108,3,smallfellowjake,14/11/2019,"Did the job, wouldn’t sleep here."
102740,727820,3,Jasalop,22/10/2019,"Perfect to know the town. But not to sleep. Noisy, a lot of traffic and cars pass at high speed. To sleep better look for another option."
102740,403703,5,Mariavacas,03/11/2018,Beautiful
102760,3091156,2,missjfe,06/08/2023,Dog barking like crazy in the big factory building next to the so called place. Did look like private property. Did not feel safe and decided to leave.
102760,3088533,5,Verolaurentscam,06/08/2023,"The track to climb has been furrowed by storms, lots of ruts, beware passage for vehicles with high ground clearance, 4x4s or like our Scam. Nice place in the shade, ventilated, with a nice view. Thank you for this post!!!!"
102760,2583658,4,juuls,19/02/2023,"Small friendly place. Saw 2 people walking their dogs and a 4x4. 2 foxes came to greet me in the evening. Not suitable for CCs, the road is quite rutted."
102760,2464615,5,Erellfclt,27/10/2022,"Quiet place, surrounded by nature. We slept very well"
102760,1875097,5,nice2seeu,07/05/2022,Perfect place although the final stretch is not for motorhomes and can be tricky in wet conditions. We did it pretty well with a 6 m GV van even getting there pitch dark. It was most rewarding.
102761,3202413,4,kkrvan,22/08/2023,"Very quiet area, perfect to spend the night, there were no prohibition signs, flat and paved road. Illuminated area and quiet neighborhood."
102761,3106138,5,reneevergauwen,09/08/2023,Had a super quiet night at this parking lot along a residential area. Not bothered by the buses that are indeed parked here. Delicious fig tree along the parking lot! Recommended.
102761,2981541,3,dasafru,18/07/2023,The 2 supermarket parking lots were full. I spent the night quiet
102761,2744217,4,Espirit,12/05/2023,"Good location, if you want to visit city centre via marina. Quiet in a residencial area."
102761,2709657,4,Reginadana,30/04/2023,"A nice and quiet place, but no shade. Going down the road on the right, which is a bit busy, you come straight ahead to the marina."
102761,2708559,5,jbbernabe,30/04/2023,"Ideal parking to visit Lagos, 5 minutes from the port. Safe residential area to spend the night. We have slept very well 1 night, despite the fact that the traffic is heard a little. Recommendable."
102761,2661030,4,YannickAlt,11/04/2023,good place.
102761,2603203,2,Almanat,08/03/2023,"We were just lucky, the seats are currently being occupied by 2 buses with 24 seats and 3 buses with 12 seats - too bad. The night was calm. The first bus left at 5 a.m. and you can hear the cars on the street. Big plus, very close to the port and easy walking distance to the old town."
102761,2573006,4,lagertha89,09/02/2023,Residential area with many new buildings and this little parking lot is also got an asphalt refresh. A few minibusses were parked (some probably for a while). We had a fairly quiet night (the road is not too busy) so this spot did its job!
102761,2501100,5,giancabusolin,20/11/2022,I found myself very well. very quiet residential area. there are no bans for motorhomes. there is only one manhole to discharge gray water. slept one night. free
102761,2264695,4,wavey1801,18/08/2022,"Felt weird as is in a residential area but we stayed 1 night and no complaints. 10 min walk, down hill, to the marina where there are excellent public loos, another 10 and you are in the heart of Lagos….. and for the price….. excellent value :-)"
102761,2113977,1,Zicapica,24/07/2022,"Dont park, this place its use for work veicules,and make noise all night"
102761,2094145,5,MrCampi,19/07/2022,"Very good parking. 5 minutes to the harbour and 10 minutes to the beach. The night is very quiet, despite of the fact that the parking is next to a street. Street lamps are super bright. But come on, parking for free over night in Lagos in such a nice location?! I recommend it for 1-2 nights :)"
102761,1950341,3,Baltus,05/06/2022,Great for visiting the city or activities. You are not there for the pleasure or the view. You can walk to the center in 15 minutes.
102761,1930091,4,mioe,29/05/2022,"We stood there with a Ducato for one night without any problems. The city center is easy to reach and the parking lot is quiet. There are 5 places, some of which were occupied by passenger buses. Otherwise not very nice."
102761,1538003,1,juanluvegat,01/09/2021,"To get out of trouble, to only sleep but nothing else. Road right next to it, little privacy, a lot of people pass by on the street ..."
102761,1495973,4,timothee-popelier,22/08/2021,"We were two camper vans, fairly quiet parking (close road but not a lot of traffic). Restaurants are a 15-minute walk away. Good parking is still parking: perfect for one night"
102761,1358410,4,NoeliaRivas,24/07/2021,"Quiet and bright place. Nobody bothered us, neither did the police (perhaps also because of the curfew). There are buildings nearby but there is no noise. Ok for one night."
102761,1110003,2,rdunky,31/10/2020,Good for one night but no more. Quite noisy because of the nearby road.
102761,976469,5,sunlightA72luxembourg,18/08/2020,For the night know very well
102761,750833,5,ColinL,07/12/2019,"I visited the stadium site then decided on this one, much smaller, much quieter and much closer to town."
102761,406637,2,djoellie,11/11/2018,"Ok considering the environment hostile to the motorhomes of this city, that will do the job"
102763,1173007,4,Kutter2,13/04/2021,Very nice right on the lake. Driveway a bit bumpy.
102763,1076693,5,xavikai,30/09/2020,Perfect for vans or cars. Narrow path with stones to get there.
102763,402452,1,baladeur74,01/11/2018,I did not dare to go down ...
102783,3170793,4,SonyGasteiz,18/08/2023,"Secure parking, surrounded by institutional buildings. Initially it can create distrust, but we have had a great two days. The only noises are the garbage truck at night and the vehicles of the currelas at 8:00 a.m. During the day we have been in Sintra using the train."
102783,3152684,4,adria640prestige,15/08/2023,We spent one night there. 4 stars for tranquility in view of other places. Just to sleep and go visit Lisbon by Uber.
102783,3141277,5,simon3102,14/08/2023,Super place located about 20 minutes by uber or train outside of lisbon. Stayed here for 2 nights to visit the city and took both the train and the train (the train station is about a 15-minute walk away)
102783,3089528,3,Heidi-Christoph,06/08/2023,Ideal for parking and staying overnight and from here to travel by train to Lisbon or Sintra. there is not much else to do here. background noise from the busy road that is 300m from this car park. we stood there for 2 nights without any problems.
102783,3065782,4,cesar31,02/08/2023,"we spent three nights there, parking ideally located to visit Lisbon or Sintra by train. Round-trip tickets to Sintra are 4€80. Then you take the bus. A ticket for the day costs 12€50. No risk compared to some car parks in Sintra. No traffic problems. it's the same for Lisbon you arrive in the city center"
102783,3040049,5,moteroAC,29/07/2023,Parking Very large and shaded. We slept 1 night with about 5 AC ... There were parties nearby and you could hear the music of the orchestra but otherwise very quiet and without traffic ... Very useful for visiting Lisbon and Sintra since they are very few stops away by train and you can walk to the train.
102783,2783831,4,Richar45,25/05/2023,"Calm night, we slept peacefully in front of the barracks. We were 6 motorhomes."
102783,2766532,4,momojean,20/05/2023,Very well enough calmed down near the palace. Also you can take the train to go to Lisbon for the day. Visit to the palace in Queluz. Great spot we spent 2 nights there no service
102783,2665822,5,majestixx,12/04/2023,The night was calm. we felt absolutely safe. With us there were 4 other mobile homes on the huge square.
102783,1746390,2,budajDominique,02/02/2022,"large car park very close to the palace, on the other hand showing in the city center there was a bad atmosphere with insecurity."
102783,1736823,5,Annel1,19/01/2022,it was calm (winter) & I slept well.
102783,1299895,4,medicus45,06/07/2021,Ideal day parking to visit the Mafra Palace. Free parking without delimitation with large areas to park long vehicles.
102783,782265,3,rodette,18/02/2020,We visited the palace at the end of the afternoon and stayed for the night on this parking lot between the Pousada and the barracks! No sense of crime! In the morning we witnessed the “rise of colors”! We do not regret the passage!
102783,609853,1,sunlightA72luxembourg,08/08/2019,"Frankly, it's not a place to sleep, the crime is super high, be careful"
102798,2781953,1,EIV,24/05/2023,"Although in the photo it seems that there is a lot of space, the truth is that it is not and when we passed it was occupied by cars, I suppose from the north."
102801,2379518,4,maulan64,17/09/2022,"Very nice point of view on a meander of the Sil. We also stayed there to eat. The road to get there is narrow but doable with a motorhome. The site is large, there is enough to turn around."
102801,2102414,4,mariinat,21/07/2022,"Very good site. We have been alone and very calm. The views are spectacular and there is no noise at all. There are garbage cans. There is no water, although in a town 10 minutes away there is a source. The ground is not very regular although it is quite level. Highly recommended."
102801,1812018,5,SiobhanandJack,09/04/2022,"An incredible place, very peaceful. There are lots of vineyards nearby and you can go for wine tasting - we went to Adega Cruceiro and would very much recommend it (you have to ring up the day before so they are expecting you)"
102801,1436864,5,juliengir,10/08/2021,Awesome spot! In the middle of nature no passage and with a view !!!
102801,1425392,5,DidacMayol,08/08/2021,"Spectacular site, you can sleep next to the viewpoint overlooking the valley. The access is very comfortable and paved. We loved it. Lucky for the description as Google Maps takes you down the path on the left, and it cannot be accessed."
102801,1395360,5,mlisbona,02/08/2021,"An extraordinary place, the access is a bit narrow but quiet that can be reached well. As it says not to follow maps but to signposts"
102801,1189802,4,santigol,09/05/2021,"A very quiet place, without people, the bad thing has no source. But the views are spectacular at sunrise"
102801,1032193,2,piruha,07/09/2020,"It is a very beautiful campsite, with direct access to one of the Sil viewpoints. It is a shame the reluctance of the staff who serve you. From the reception to the bar. They seem saturated without the camping being more than 20%. Showering is an odyssey and the toilets / showers are not clean. I said, a shame"
102801,1028176,5,Alonka,05/09/2020,Beautiful site
102801,637464,5,Exo5,17/08/2019,"Great place: beautiful view and wide and flat area to stay away. Indeed the GPS does not indicate the right direction, you have to take a right fork and not left."
102801,607078,5,albasanchezharo,07/08/2019,"The place is beautiful, the views of the canyon are worth 100%. The space is wide and flat, perfect for campers, because the access road is not very wide. ⚠️Eye! Follow the signs to the viewpoint and not the coordinates."
102801,522813,5,Derrickette,20/06/2019,"A lunch break alone with this beautiful view, it was perfect! A. Water point at the entrance of the parking."
102801,505578,5,NinkyNonk,06/06/2019,A beautiful quiet place with fantastic views. The route in is signed from the “main road”. Follow signs for Santiorxo. The road is narrow but paved all of the way. Definitely no passing traffic. The rubbish bin gets emptied.
102801,443474,5,robertrouveen,23/03/2019,"Great place! Just beautiful! This time of year it was very quiet during day and night (weekend). Would recommend this place. No services of course however there is a dustbin for trash. 

*We just cleaned the place of it's garbage so please keep it clean:)!"
102801,405923,5,FolksOfEurope,08/11/2018,"Space for 5 Mobile, easy access, great views !!"
102804,2446547,5,alicebolognanj,16/10/2022,"perfect place to visit Barcelona, one minute walk from the train station which takes you to the center with 4 stops. We left the camper parked for two days and always felt safe. Quiet night, the only noise is the train."
102804,1997497,4,checkmate,21/06/2022,"Very quiet area, except for the sound of the train, but it is not very disturbing. When we arrived, all the motorhomes were parked outside the parking lot, in the nearby streets. We don't know if it's because it's further from the train or because it's not allowed to park in the car park (there's no prohibition signage). There was a lot of free space when we were there (8:30 p.m. to 10 a.m.). Train station right next door."
102804,1790170,4,Dune49,21/03/2022,"We stayed 3 days without any problem, secure parking lit during the night and passage of the gardia civil. To visit Barcelona we took the R3 train via ""Moncadat ripollet"" and ""Vic"" for the return... count 2.40€ for 1 trip 30 mn (ticket at the station bar) Too bad the weather was not good not at the appointment :("
102804,1491727,4,AdamWeb,21/08/2021,Free parking area in a quiet residential area. 2 minutes from the Bcn-Vuc train station (L3). No services (toilets at the station). Good for 1 night.
102847,3271537,1,marinaundandre,08/09/2023,10 minutes on the beach and our car was broken into. Don't make it people even just short.
102847,2818239,4,marchenin,04/06/2023,"superb place on a small cliff overlooking the sea, access to the beach but sporty. Accessible with 4x4, very sandy and soft track. Peaceful and calm place. Thank you for this spot."
102847,2335177,5,ChanelDanada,03/09/2022,"Great spot, really safe, but only 4x4 at this point"
102847,2258501,1,FofiDav,17/08/2022,Run away!!! THIEVES!! A short walk (30 minutes max) on the beach was enough. They broke a window and robbed us. They have a hiding place on the heights in the groves.
102847,524402,1,AdvanturersT5,22/06/2019,Don't come here because you destroy the dunes. Be more responsible with the environment. You have a parking with beautiful view next to this
102847,503644,5,megan1,04/06/2019,Super beautiful place.
102871,3045811,5,TeAtatuMihaka,30/07/2023,"Washed clothes well, nice smelling detergent. Parking large enough for campers on the street over. Cafe next door. 

5€ for 10kg wash. 2€ for 12min dryer. 12min long enough to dry sheets/towels."
102871,936306,1,Lau1976,07/08/2020,We did not like the service for the cost of washing. It hardly smells clean. The drying service is lousy. Drying must be programmed at least 2 times so that the clothes come out as intended.
102888,1902682,4,jppseudo,20/05/2022,Well ventilated place allowing access to Almeria by bike through very beautiful cycle paths.

102889,2947127,4,BraviaCamper,10/07/2023,"Good place to stay to visit Donostia. Depending on the section of road more or less oblique. 25 minute walk to the beach, a supermarket just up the road, there is drinking water at the skate park. We stayed 2 nights and would come back."
102889,2821574,3,Jean4020,05/06/2023,Fairly busy car park on a slight slope after a 10% climb. 15 minutes from the city center by Can-am. Fairly quiet night near a street with little traffic at night.
102889,2474251,4,TanoPereira,31/10/2022,"Site away from the center, but good communication with public transport. We did not see any water intake or fountain nearby. To park there were no problems, there were also other campers in the area and that gives peace of mind."
102889,2225947,4,AlbitaaG,12/08/2022,"Wide street with parking in both directions. We have slept accompanied by many caravans and vans. Cars pass by, but for a night it's not bad. Also very close to the center. We have come in August and the temperature is perfect."

102889,1765154,3,DaviddeTudela,25/02/2022,"This is the ""RV park"" of the city. There is nothing better or closer to the city and without paying. Paying for parking should be illegal."
102889,1661521,3,isabellaoh,25/10/2021,Fine for visiting the city if you’re okay with it being a bit of a walk. Free and there’s a supermarket nearby with toilets. Very busy with cars driving by in the daytime. We slept here without problem.
102889,1592235,3,SaraAndrea,19/09/2021,"For a visit it is fine, it is far from the beach but it is not easy to find a place nearby, but you can take the bus. it also has a supermarket nearby. a little sloping. we didn't sleep there but it looks peaceful"

102889,436598,5,NiciNo,05/03/2019,"A good and safe way to park the car. Until San Sebastian, however, it is a short walk of 30min. Toilets can be found in the nearby supermarket."

102891,2974766,5,kvalten,16/07/2023,"Beautiful place right at the lake, great for swimming, sup boarding and relaxing. The beginning of the road is rather steep. I've seen crafter size vans go up, but would't go with a regular camper. On weekends it is rather crowded during the day (still very nice though) , but quiet after 8 pm."
102891,2282890,5,nielspriem,22/08/2022,"Beautiful location on the lake! The lake is now dry, so there is a beautiful flat green meadow with enough space for many campers. We spent the night here with only 1 other van. The sunset is beautiful too!"

102891,2209094,4,elomiketrip,10/08/2022,"Very beautiful and very quiet, in the middle of nature, accessible by van but indeed very sloping access not easy to go up. We arrived too late to really enjoy it hence the 4 but it probably deserves a 5 star"
102891,2176296,5,patriceporet,04/08/2022,"Magnificent I confirm... in the middle of nature ..... except to avoid large motorhomes... for 6m going down yes but going up I slipped at one point. In short, I do not regret at all ... the water is good! Tranquility assured!!! plenty of room!"
102891,1500443,4,maestroangel,23/08/2021,The place is very good. The descent must be done carefully if the vehicle is low. We had an uneventful night.

102891,1352475,5,judderi,22/07/2021,Awesome spot! The track down is a little narrow and bumpy for a big Motorhome but we made it and it was worth it.
102891,1179162,3,609tribe,25/04/2021,"Superb view, but very tense access, big slope, it's hot to get out, small vehicles okay, but I had to go back 3x to get out. (609 crate) woken up by fishermen 1m from the truck at 8am."
102891,1019474,5,UneLouve,01/09/2020,"Top ! In Kangoo and carefully, it goes easy. I spent the night there alone (last Sunday in August), I was cold (it's in altitude) but the water is almost lukewarm and the morning swim a real delight. We hear the road (but there is little passage) and the bells of animals grazing invisible."
102891,1005999,5,mullekall,27/08/2020,"Unfortunately, you can't get down with large campers. But in itself super nice. During the day there are many kayakers and day trippers, in the evening we were alone."
102891,654363,2,DOMMOBILE,23/08/2019,"Arrived on the 22/08/19, CC 7.40 m. Not want to test this descent ... if rain, impossible to go back in my humble opinion."

102985,774816,4,garysajames,01/02/2020,"When you reach the coordinates there is a pull off the road behind you onto a cobble surfaced circle - an old threshing circle. Level and a perfect view plus well clear of the track. The approach is rugged, narrow and twisty. Our VW transporter was fine, larger motorhomes best avoid."
102989,1832809,4,VAT_furgo,17/04/2022,Parking is not level but we were very quiet and pretty much alone. The views are spectacular.

102989,467835,4,Ouchou,26/04/2019,"Parking with a lot of slope. Being alone we were able to choose and we set ourselves low to protect ourselves from the wind. Still we had a great night without noise and with incredible views. San Martin de Unx is worth it, the bad thing is that you have to ask for an appointment by phone to take a guided tour. So we just walked through the streets."

103098,1743605,5,JIvan77,29/01/2022,"As it says, waking up is as if you were on the sheet, with the sun on the horizon and surrounded by unemployed people and low trees. Ideal to spend a night or stop for a walk and rest."
103098,1646772,5,gabrieltomas,16/10/2021,Super silent night. Barking was just from long distance.
103098,1444281,5,Mathou0404,12/08/2021,"Deserted place, savannah atmosphere, absolutely magnificent. Very quiet night without any noise. Splendid starry sky without stray light.

103098,895102,4,jice2401,24/07/2020,"Nice place, very quiet. At the risk of repeating, BE CAREFUL at the entrance to the runway if low ground clearance or long rear overhang, we touched and there were remains of pipes and gray water evacuation taps"
103098,782496,5,DerTutNix,18/02/2020,"As the predecessors have already described, be careful when entering and if you like it quieter, quietly follow the paths deeper inside. Everyone should find space and peace here."
103098,774543,5,Rickontour,31/01/2020,"Really quiet and beautiful place, seems to be a kind of renaturation. Reminds of a kind of savannah with a few trees. The descent from the street requires a little ground clearance (see 4th photo). With us, the overhang has touched down. The rest of the way is very easy to do, even in damp conditions."

103098,396298,4,blaiseetvero,20/10/2018,Superb place in absolute calm. On the other hand to pay attention to the entrance of the path so small ground clearance. We touched badly with a 741.

103123,3115238,4,Atavernier33,10/08/2023,Superb view over the sea. Along the road but little traffic at night. The place is famous for its sunset (a dozen cars pass and stop to admire). We spent the night there without problems despite the strong wind!!
103123,2465530,4,Isabel567,27/10/2022,"It is a walk and a good hill from the Gaztelugatxe view area. There is no pedestrian area to go down or go up. You go down and up the road, in October there is not much traffic but perhaps in summer it can be a bit dangerous. Nice views and level."
103123,2447072,3,Galileo74,16/10/2022,"good place to stop and visit the Hermitage. in the rest of the car parks it is impossible for the Cars. By the way, the tables in the description of the place are no longer there."

Be very careful around the area!"
103123,1931620,5,FeeeNdr,30/05/2022,"Ideal for visiting the monastery when the main car park is full. 20 minutes walk to get to the entrance, ideal with an electric bike because the return is steep! We didn't spend the night there and preferred the parking lot higher up on the map."

103151,2604952,5,nelewerenz,10/03/2023,"Very nice place but also very busy. Located directly on the water, beautiful paths for walking. You feel safe."
103151,2603716,4,Mojari,09/03/2023,more sheltered from the wind than at 38 Galea Errepidea. we spent a quiet night here (midweek).
103151,2544678,1,InigoA,07/01/2023,"CARE! They have started to fine, it is also an area with a lot of noise and where they usually have parties at night. Some kids broke my rearview mirror"
103151,2489693,4,Van4life64,10/11/2022,Superb quiet place with self-cleaning WC. I recommend it to spend a night in complete autonomy! I am in a Master van plus a 5.90m long bicycle rack. Bidezabal metro station 10 mins walk to Bilbao. BM supermarket 5 mins away. Park in the direction of the parking lot and not across.
103151,2488510,5,valdi92,09/11/2022,"Perfect site. We have spent two great nights, without noise (we were only four vans), clean public toilets in the parking lot itself (they close at night) 5 minutes walk from the beach. Metro station 5 minutes and 20 minutes by metro to the center of Bilbao."
103151,2484207,5,imkemk,05/11/2022,"A super nice and quiet place, perfect to visit Bilbao. During the day there is a lot going on, but in the evening it gets emptier. You're never alone there. There are actually always other campers there, which gave us security. The toilets are very clean. The metro station Bidezabal is within walking distance, where you can easily go to the center of Bilbao :)"
103151,2475352,5,Meokie,31/10/2022,"Best place is at the back against the mill, with a 7m camper that was the only option, if it is occupied, turn around. There are more options for shorter motorhomes. This one is better than the northern large parking lot because it's a little more out of the wind, especially when it's full, and less chance of noise from hangcars because there are houses next to it. Also closer to the village and metro, easy to walk there."
103151,2463826,3,Zedas,26/10/2022,Good place but got infested with ants
103151,2462355,4,travellingfinn,25/10/2022,Nice place with a great view and a good place to take a walk. Not much car traffic but people can walk by very late/early. The parkingspots are best suited for campervans.

103151,2311800,4,Danieloner,28/08/2022,"The length of the spaces according to the Ac you have if it exceeds the parking line the police will fine you, we were already preparing things to go down to the beach and the owners of other ACs came to tell us that we should take that into account because others who They were in the morning and they put a clamp on the wheel for exceeding the length of the square. We slept on Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer street."
103151,2300562,5,NefDragon,25/08/2022,"reserved but accessible place, a stone's throw from a breathtaking view, a cycle path that I believe reaches the city and a free self-cleaning public bathroom, perfect."
103151,2293636,5,fannyc95,24/08/2022,"Top for visiting bilbao if you don't want to risk burglary. It is quiet at this parking lot, many people walk past the promenade with their dogs. The public toilets are great and self-cleaning, there is a fitness area right next to it and the beach is a 5 minute walk. Everything perfect"
103151,2248833,5,froglegeater,16/08/2022,"The spot is perfect, rather quiet, clean modern toilets, and showers at a beautiful beach in walking distance. Police came by in the morning and didn't seem to mind. They were less happy the next day because two dudes had left all their trash on the grass. We cleaned after them, but this is not how vanlife is supposed to work! take care of the area! this is how more and more spots get closed"
103151,2174371,4,EloiAA,04/08/2022,"Perfect parking to rest one night, no noise. Slightly sloping seats and free WC in very good condition. Incredible views of the estuary. It is better not to park on the side of the lawn since around 04:00 the sprinklers come on and wet the vehicle, with their respective noise."

We spent 1 very good night there, we were just surprised to be woken up at 4am by the automatic watering jets against the Truck. Nothing serious, we just changed places to continue our night. Pay attention to the chosen place, not too close to the Plants and Hydrangeas!"
103151,2143811,4,oscardekooning,30/07/2022,"I had a very peaceful night here. Very safe with other campers on site. Toilets are available that clean themselves. The first flights arrive from 7 a.m., so you are well awake right away. I had a very good night here."
103151,2139273,5,wanda1909,29/07/2022,"Great place to visit Bilbao, walk and go to the beach. Toilet is super clean. The parking bays are small and therefore not for mobile homes. If your car doesn't fit in the gap, please accept that and go to a parking space made for it!"
103151,2135168,4,Bobbypointe8,28/07/2022,"Former restaurant parking lot now closed. Very convenient to visit Bilbao by taking the bus (1€5 per person). Quiet with a lot of places. Do not hesitate to use the public toilets to avoid bad smells. No feelings of insecurity, quiet night. Which makes it a very good spot compared to other reviews for Bilbao."
103151,2112116,5,Coutschi,23/07/2022,"Great spot! Quiet residential area. Clean toilets, sometimes locked after 10pm. At the beach (10 min walk away) there are restaurants and public showers. The coast invites to walks. A fitness course on the promenade offers sports opportunities. Quiet at night, but people with dogs from around 6 a.m. in the morning."
103151,2096341,5,kloemi,20/07/2022,"Super parking space for vans or smaller mobile homes and at the same time a perfect location to explore the area. Either with the metro (10 minutes walk) to get to the city center or by bike to explore the area. Furthermore, the beach is only 7 minutes walk away where you can just relax. Please keep the place clean so that it stays with us!"

103151,1966439,5,camperbenn,11/06/2022,"Great spot for visiting Bilbao and Getxo. Beach is a 5 minute walk. Nice bars close to the beach. Within a 20 minute walk you have loads of nice restaurants. Metro to Bilbao is a 10 minute walk and after a 30 minute ride you are in the center. Btw, dogs upto 8 kilos are allowed on the metro if you carry Them in your arms."
103151,1942138,4,woody93,03/06/2022,"Too bad this car park is like the rest of the coast, not designed for motorhomes, the places are small. The beach has to be earned, we are at first sight about 30 meters high and we see it from afar, maybe I'm difficult?"
103151,1914486,3,Steffi.und.Tobi,25/05/2022,"In itself a nice and very quiet parking lot. Unfortunately, our van was hit here at midnight even though we were almost at the back. While we were discussing with those who caused the accident, a second small van left the area right next to us, two men were smoking in it. Was it fake? We do not know it."
103151,1902978,5,Velocity,20/05/2022,We stayed there for one night... Very quiet... Sleeping doesn't seem to be forbidden there. There is no sign and the police didn't say anything during a patrol...

Finding a free place was an impossible mission and we decided to rest and spend the night in this spot. We could not have made a better choice: quiet, in a beautiful setting, with a walk along the cliffs a few meters away ... We slept peacefully next to several vans. The police passed by and did not stop or pose any problems. Highly recommended"

103327,1675051,1,Boutboutm,02/11/2021,"A star but not for the place because it is correct but a hyper weird man was lurking around our van, stopped with his car near us then left again staring at us, got out of his car, freezing to look at our camper van and smiling unhealthily ... Really creepy when we are two girls ... We left"

103327,1593254,5,Manu88,19/09/2021,"Quiet area, car seats with which you have to look for the one that we least disturb. In a walk you get to the town across the bridge. The town is worth it. Oh and on the other side of the river there is a small water change area, without parking."

103327,1018078,5,lifeaswevan,01/09/2020,"We absolutely loved this place (and the whole town). Lots of free spaces with shade, super close to the rover where you can swim and also very close to the town center by foot (10 min). We loved it so much we stayed for 4 nights. It did however have some traffic as there’s always a car passing by every now and then, even at night, but not too much noise."

Also, if time permits, you can take a dip in the river itself. There is a yacht club where you can rent cheap kayaks or bikes ..."

103327,547694,4,MJL,10/07/2019,"No service. Free. Many places. Once the cars are gone, it's very quiet. In any case we slept well. It's even better than the overcrowded parking on the other side of the shore. Not far from Ponte on foot"
103327,531187,4,Ivairdj,28/06/2019,"Calm and quiet place! In 2019 this is the only place we can stop without a fine. In Expolima and next to the Bridge is prohibited, there are warning signs."
103327,525167,3,Dwarfland,22/06/2019,15 minutes to town- we stayed on a friday in june and there was one other m/h and a couple of cars in the huge car park. Good alternative to the riverside car park next to the bridge which now has signs preventing m/h’s. Only downside is noise from cars on cobbles - it’s quite busy through the day as drivers use it as a cut through.
103327,519300,3,debycoles,17/06/2019,"No facilities except bins but the parking is fabulous, in a very pretty place. It's got to be one of the niceist of parking spots. On weekdays, however, the parking area is a bit of a rat run of car after car after car passing by. It is super quiet at night though, we had two very good sleeps."

103327,432894,4,farwest,24/02/2019,"Very nice well maintained, quiet parking, 5 minutes walk from the Bridge of Lima. The thud of traffic in the distance is not disturbing. To know that there are also a lot of cars that pass here to reach the restaurant next door but frankly it remains quiet and we hear the birds chirping. For those who prefer to be away from overcrowded car parks."
103327,413781,4,hare,12/12/2018,"If it still supply and disposal, it would be really fantastic. But even so, a great place"

103327,394291,4,thegapdecaders,16/10/2018,"We stopped here for 2 nights as the market was on, restricting access to the main market area by the river.  Very quiet, a few cars coming & going until 2230hrs & then exceptionally quiet, no traffic noise, church bells stop at 2200hrs & lush green surroundings. 15 minutes walks you into town. Access is good, level & hard standing. No services but highly recommended."

103328,1973064,4,Marielazzs,13/06/2022,"Good place to sleep, views of the sunset and the impressive stars. Very clean and quiet, nearby road with little traffic. There are no trees so there is no shade either, but the wind is blowing and not too hot, we have been in June and it is very bearable."
103328,1877522,5,ronjawanderlust,08/05/2022,Insane view! you feel like you are in the middle of the mountains. There is no rubbish bin - please don't leave anything behind. Great for an overnight stay - even if it can get chilly. :)

103334,3224834,4,jtevalencia,27/08/2023,"We went at night but it was a total discovery, although the terrain is a little uneven, there were few people and we were able to park in a good place, it is free, bathrooms only from 10:00 to 16:00, less than 1 minute walk from the cove and It is impressive. It has a beach bar that opens at 12 and the showers are standing. Super quiet, familiar place, little light pollution that is ideal for seeing the stars."

Bad luck for us that evening, because tourists had a very big enclosure but once they left, calm returned and the night was quiet."
103334,2018425,4,bomba94,28/06/2022,"Good spot for a quiet evening and night. In the evening the national guard passed but they didn't stop to tell us anything, so no disturbance! The car park is that of the beach and the bar, but by 9pm it was almost completely empty. We slept in the company of another camper, but there is really a lot of space. The only caveat is the fact that there are not many spaces on the level."
103334,1951307,5,JuRoVW,06/06/2022,"Nice quiet spot. Surprisingly little going on in the morning, even though today is a holiday. Quiet until nine or ten o'clock. Please note that the toilets can only be used during official opening times between 11:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. No more showers! Beach bar closed early with the last swimmers leaving. Attention, in the evening, the garbage truck comes down to the beach at high speed, be careful on foot on the unlit paths."

103352,2808086,5,ManiTheVani,01/06/2023,"The only place we found in Ericeria that was flat and didn’t have a height barrier. Great nights sleep, felt very safe to leave during the day and night as surrounded by beautiful motels. 5-10 minute walk to restaurants and bars. No signage saying we couldn’t park here but the motel staff looked a little unimpressed. Room for 3 campers."
103352,2729082,4,Romy1306,06/05/2023,Behind the supermarket a small dead end: 3 vans with us!!! Walkers with their dogs walk in the small park next door. Easy to visit the city and sleep. Store's AC system quite noisy at night. Shop open daily from 0800 to 2100. Toilets inside.
103352,2108659,3,ChristinedeCiboure,22/07/2022,Small dead end difficult to park without having the feeling of hindering the beautiful houses around we did not stay
103352,2024096,3,kiwanuka,30/06/2022,"Perfect to visit the city and spend a night. Disadvantage of the noise of, I suppose, the cooling system of the Continent, with getting away a little enough!"
