91250,3259347,5,kashiia1812,04/09/2023,"We were there for a few nights at the end of August. Yes, sanitary facilities need renovation, but ok. Very nice service, nice guests. Mega cheap, with a multivan, tent and four people 20 euros a night. We will be back."
91250,3233487,3,DavidGaba,29/08/2023,"It is a campsite without great luxuries but with good value for money. Caravan, car and 4 people €25 per day. Plots with hard soil and stones. There is no paper in the toilets, which look old, but are clean and do their job correctly. Restaurant to get out of trouble and little else. Nice reception staff and they speak Spanish."
91250,3202013,1,gijonudo,22/08/2023,"In our opinion a fair campsite. The services leave a lot to be desired, toilets quite clean and without paper, showers that fulfill their function without further ado... but dirty and left. For the rest, very large plots for Autocas, drinking water service near the plots and plenty of power outlets. As for the BAD reception, you have to get the information out of it little by little and it's up to you."
91250,3196764,1,maurineduclos,21/08/2023,"unpleasant staff, it was up to us to see if there was room for a tent, only places in full sun. campsite not clean with dog droppings on the way. we are leaving again"
91250,3189704,5,tot38210,20/08/2023,"THE GOOD SURPRISE! very large van pitches, little shade and wind. Very good surprise with the restaurant with a French boss, excellent welcome and we had a great evening. The kids loved the atmosphere. Swimming pool refreshing and clean, sanitary same even if they would need to be refreshed. Came for one night, we stayed there for 2, we felt so good there!"
91250,3084589,4,parknight2615,05/08/2023,"Very nice, well-kept campsite (except for the sanitary facilities, but that's a fundamental problem in Portugal?) We were here for 3 days and made two nice trips by water taxi to the beach islands. This campsite definitely has a lot of potential."
91250,3075069,1,christelletony,04/08/2023,No shame we walked to find very lied spaces in the sun and very far from the pool we fled
91250,2956809,3,joaocurtinha,13/07/2023,Little more explored park. Campervan site with little shade. Spas in need of refurbishment. In the height of summer they should limit the entry of people outside the pool. very confused
91250,2664748,1,AdriaOsel,12/04/2023,"After a short tour of the camper area, we continue. At least this area is in dire need of renovation. Otherwise nice facility for permanent campers."
91250,2632771,5,selderfield,31/03/2023,"This campsite is a little gem and i have no idea why other campers rate it so low -we had a super welcome despite arriving late ( ring the exhibited phone number !) . The swimming pool is gorgeous , restaurant is run by a French couple and the food was terrific -better than many more expensive restaurants. It’s also super cheap and should charge more as we had hot water in the basins !"
91250,2572019,2,FollowAdvanced,08/02/2023,"There is a gray water disposal facility, but it's difficult to access depending on where you have your drain. Criss-cross pitches on sandy soil with broken walls and sometimes difficult access to electricity. Vacant, unreserved numbered parking spaces were not allowed to be used in some cases. We don't know why... The only advantage: the price!"
91250,2414433,2,EDUKRIS,30/09/2022,"Calico. The reception She was very unfriendly and half of the questions we asked her about the campsite said that she did not know, the campsite is very good in the Bungalows area, but in the caravan camping area a disaster, very dirty, unpaved with many mosquitoes , very old and dirty toilets, no toilet paper in the batter, most of the plots without electricity outlets, no dogs in the bar"
91250,2344718,4,HappyHarry,06/09/2022,"A nice place with friendly reception. Motorhome pitches & services are basic. The pool, bar & restaurant are excellent. The food was very good & the restaurant manager & staff were very friendly. Thank you"
91250,2319688,4,VeraResende,30/08/2022,"Pleasant park, with many services available and free swimming pool. A land with many irregularities for motorhomes but it had good and flat spaces. The bathhouses are good, more like the old ones but always clean and hot water. I didn't find it expensive for the conditions. Liked it"
91250,2275289,1,joelico,20/08/2022,"A poor service how it's been days since we've seen, after dizzy with whether it was busy or not, tells us that where we see a hole we go. That yes without option to light because they say that they have it saturated. The plots are not respected and with lazy workers and borders. The only recommendation is not to go."
91250,2271827,3,Martaschez6,20/08/2022,"We spent one night there. It has all the services that the camper needed (electricity socket, drinking water, sewage disposal, etc.) It's fine but nothing special either. The reception a bit edge."
91250,2267541,3,LosCantos,19/08/2022,"A quiet campsite, you have to arrive before 7 p.m. and reservations for a van / motorhome are not made by phone. We paid €16 per night with Electricity and all services + swimming pools. It's a good stopover on the way back home and have the children play."
91250,2189744,2,A.HAMEL,07/08/2022,"We paid €13 for one night in a 2-person roof tent. Fair price with swimming pool. The only problem is the aging sanitary facilities and very little flat ground, especially since it is free placement so some people straddle 2 places. If you have holds for one night it exceeds."
91250,2055069,4,Joerg1962,09/07/2022,"Very nice small campsite, but not very easy to find. Many small cottages, which were mostly occupied by English. Nice pool with nice cafe. Free seats. Cheap price. €16 in high season. Sanitary facilities very outdated. Smell borderline in the men's area. Although the beach is 5 km away, it is incredibly beautiful."
91250,1694171,1,HugoMiguel,20/11/2021,"I arrived around 4 pm, reception closed. I contacted the number on the door was out of order. there I managed to find a park employee, friendly there, he let me in. I didn't find dumps, points of light, places very uneven and all muddy. I turned around and I left. only good for modular houses the rest is to forget AC Micas do Jaime assigns 0 star"
91250,1663455,1,stefanbrons,26/10/2021,"Extraordinary rotten camping / motorhome. Almost no electricity plumbing is so bad I wouldn't want to pee my dog there. No place is horizontal, everything is crooked. don't come here. €20 paid. But is € 20 too much. also the reception is unfriendly"
91250,1428814,2,rickymagui,09/08/2021,"The park staff was friendly at check-in. Unfortunately the park is not designed for caravan or camping. It works more focused on prefab houses that occupy, as I understand, a large part of it. The pool is a generous size but with cloudy water, the toilet installations were very dirty and with some spoiled material."
91250,969094,2,ely22,16/08/2020,Closed due to covid according to the manager
91250,674146,1,onubense,03/09/2019,"It is the worst thing that I have seen, it cannot be called camping, it is rather a town, there is no supermarket service or motorhome service or camping sites"
91250,660448,2,ypenetro,26/08/2019,Camping very nice on arrival but for campsites because it is basically in an area not suitable. Beware of many nails on the floor. However the young staff is nice. Showers and Wc outdated but clean early in the morning. No hot water for dishes and random mixer for showers.
91250,639995,1,Tanruz,18/08/2019,"The campsite deserves four stars, unfortunately campers do not seem welcome. The space reserved for them is disgusting. We did not stay."
91250,581762,3,gdha,28/07/2019,"We were only there for supplies, water costs 5 €"
91250,432003,2,Christine27,22/02/2019,"Campground party floor with sanitary very very dilapidated, forced to go to the bathroom in the middle of the campsite to have a minimum of comfort .. Borne electricity far away! Van + 2pers + electricity = 20 € Too expensive! And do not talk about the reception Many English residents in the year in moblilhome ...."
91250,378263,4,ENCB153,20/09/2018,The facilities were great and the staff was super nice. They stayed open a little later for us because we called in a little before the reception closed. Only problem we’re the dogs from the farm next door barking until late.
91250,365327,5,jamcosta,05/09/2018,Calm camping with very nice views and facilities.
91250,342151,4,bensoiz,18/08/2018,"Nice campsite with pool and bar restaurant. We stayed 1 night on the way home. Sanitary main clean, those available to campers are less"
91250,337370,4,Cali4nia,16/08/2018,"Good campsite very welcome despite a late arrival, we had to make one night we made 2. Nice pool to cool open until 21h. Just follow the signs ""balnearios"" which leads to dilapidated sanitary but suitable (with doors that lock for the slanderers). 28 € / night for 4 with electricity (2 adults, 1 teenager, 1 child)"
91250,319588,2,romulus92,07/08/2018,"Not suitable for motorhomes, nudist shower without doors ..."
91250,317838,4,alex1dregirard,06/08/2018,"Camping on clay, very little shade .... nice pool, quiet sea view in the distance"
91250,313419,4,jonandv,03/08/2018,"Very nice setting, terraced pitches and plenty of space with great views. Swimming pool is fabulous and although access is just about possible for bigger motorhomes/RVs, the internal road needs some improvements. There are no height restrictions and we just managed to get our 11m long RV in. Not a lot of shade for motorhomes. High season, €32 for motorhome, 2 adults, 2 kids and a dog. The access/approach road is OK, there’s a small roundabout about 2km out, the roads are deserted so if you’re big you can carefully sneak through the wrong way !"
91261,3220056,5,olivierguilly,26/08/2023,superb and relaxing. It is also possible to stand in front of the church a little further along the reservoir. place under the trees if the sun is at the appointment.
91261,3085591,5,Ametseb,06/08/2023,"Great place. We arrived at night and discovered this large flat grassy field, surrounded by wooden fence facing the lake. Magical alarm clock for the whole family. The site is super clean. Thank you all for having discreet and respectful behavior so that this kind of place persists"
91261,1688520,5,troitas,14/11/2021,"We spent the night very quiet, pleasant, spacious place, a good place to spend the night."
91261,1473531,5,dasaf,17/08/2021,A nice quiet place

91261,1162452,5,feparta,01/04/2021,"Great place, very beautiful, quiet and flat environment, we spent the night without any problem two motorhomes"
91261,846808,5,jorconde,03/07/2020,"Very nice place to come and spend the day, we haven't spent the night but it looks good. Ideal for a dip on the road."
91261,838339,4,LaSabbi,27/06/2020,"Good place to spend the night. We went by van and great, the Ac have to be careful with the branches since some were not pruned. Barbecues, fairly flat ground and a water fountain at the entrance. Spectacular lake views, absolute silence for sleeping. The truth is that the site is worth it, the only bad thing is that there are no street lamps or lights at night."
91261,636373,4,furgoMamadu,17/08/2019,"Beautiful place!!!! very quiet with lawn and beautiful views of the lagoon, with parking areas, benches and stone barbecues."
91261,590553,5,thomasbreton35,01/08/2019,Easy to access location. Flat land by the lake with picnic table and barbecue. This is not a problem. Very calm.
91261,544572,5,Matschi4x4,08/07/2019,"Very nice place, we spent a quiet night here."
91261,461318,4,JOSE.PAULA,20/04/2019,"Beautiful place to spend the night, in the middle of nature with spectacular views of the lake. We have stopped to sleep, lucky to see the sunset over the village. It is one of the most beautiful places we have been. The road has poor soil, both on the asphalted part and on the dirt road, with holes and areas a little narrow, but driving slowly you arrive well even with large AC. Beware of antennas in areas of the road that are wooded"
91261,359104,5,robdelobel,29/08/2018,Fantastic place in the middle of the countryside. Very small village with a few houses. Very peaceful and quite. Beautiful views. We biked around the lake and loved it. On the other side of the lake there is a nice hotel/ restaurant.
91273,3147929,2,Piecy,14/08/2023,A very beautiful spot to park up for the day with very nice views. A police officer approached us and told us we cannot stay overnight. All of the other vans were also told they could not stay. Perhaps this is because this is higher season (August) but it might be a new rule.
91273,3037178,3,JaviFurgoneto,28/07/2023,Quite noisy in summer since it is the path of the campsite. It is level and the views of the estuary are beautiful!
91273,2921474,5,ruedasypatas,04/07/2023,"We spent a quiet night. The baker arrives in the morning whistling and with the van loaded. Views out of ten, a good place to spend a night. Area to walk with a cat in the area, be careful with the dogs... nearby containers, respect the area. take care of her"
91273,2675513,4,Fijnja,16/04/2023,"Nice quiet parking space, spent the night without any problems. Seems especially suitable (and allowed) during the early or late season. Looks like it can be very busy during summer days."
91273,2658402,3,exparkpert,10/04/2023,"Normal parking lot, definitely ok for one night. But very full due to Easter, so we went to the nearby campsite."
91273,2656855,4,chebello,10/04/2023,Quiet car park next to the beautiful Rodiles beach. Several bars nearby. We have had no problem spending the night.
91273,2619960,2,Waischno,22/03/2023,"Normal parking spaces, tight even with 6 meters. Quite full during the day, even in the off-season. Great view of the beach."

91273,2301375,5,Beko75,25/08/2022,"Magnificent car park at the foot of the estuary, and just 200 meters from Rodiles beach. Gratuitous. Idyllic place. Overnight is allowed."
91273,2278062,4,happycampeRV,21/08/2022,Great place for overnight stay. magnificent views of the Ria and mountains. Good walk or cycle route. it can be busy on good days. The bar and restaurant can be noisy on the weekends particularly in the summer
91273,1943106,4,Thetrippyhippy,03/06/2022,"Awesome spot, we went out of season.
Only down side local kids turned up at 22.30 with 2 stroke bikes revving like they had a pair."
91273,1871099,5,KateGainsford,05/05/2022,We had a wonderful stay in early May. Quiet and peaceful. Complete tranquility. Beautiful walks and empty beaches near by. We enjoyed a meal and some beers at La Ensenada which was a stone's throw from where we had parked. The view from our camper in the morning was wonderful. We were undesturbed by the police but only stayed one night. I can see if you went in high season it could be noisy.
91273,1867940,3,thetarget,03/05/2022,"Nice view but very noisy. It was very busy with vans and visitors, plus two bars playing loud music and with people talking outside. I parked around the corner where it's quieter, but you could still hear a concert.  Only go if you're ok with much noise."
91273,1839308,5,CINZIAontheROAD,19/04/2022,"Beautiful panorama and landscapes. Parking on pebbles for vans or campers within 7 meters on level ground. In front of the beach with two restaurants behind it. At this very quiet time of year, popular with surfers and fishermen. Trash cans present and picnic tables inside the woods. Even in the rain a very pleasant place"
91273,1800532,4,shellt69,29/03/2022,"Parked slightly round the corner from this, facing the main estuary. Really nice stopover with very little traffic and great night's sleep. Had bins but no other services although close to several restaurants by the campsite. Lovely walk on the beach too."
91273,1739491,5,Caselas46,23/01/2022,"Simple parking, quite flat but quiet and with good views. We will return."

91273,1006960,4,vincoche,27/08/2020,During the day it is impossible to park but at sunset vans start to arrive. Nice place that overlooks the estuary and with some bars nearby. We have slept very calm and comfortable. Recommendable.
91273,992725,4,martaycoco,22/08/2020,"Perfect for vans, overlooking the estuary beach. In front of some restaurants, make your way. Quiet place at night, close to the sea for a morning swim and a shady pine forest and picnic areas."
91273,650530,5,Franlopezricarte,22/08/2019,"Good area to spend the night in camper, quiet area passes the police from time to time bar restaurant opposite"
91273,409160,5,mef,21/11/2018,Beautiful quiet spot with cafe that was still open in November
91286,3087914,4,JTtraveller,06/08/2023,"Good place in front of the sea. I counted 20 motorhomes while we were there (in August). The train rings, but it didn't bother us much."
91286,2635470,1,lisbethjensen,02/04/2023,"the police hand out fines here, every night"
91286,2568466,4,llunadana,04/02/2023,quiet car park you can take a detour and avoid the 2m tunnels we 3 x 7.50 and no problem
91286,2464266,5,Tui,27/10/2022,"Local police pass with some frequency and apply the regulations: overnight yes, camping no. We are welcome. There are containers of all kinds. Quite a lot of noise from the train and any height can be reached here by turning a little over a bridge."
91286,2324216,3,vanliferthibslea,31/08/2022,"Superb view, close to showers. Close to a somewhat noisy campsite until 4am. And close to a small restaurant-bar open until late. Large spacious parking lot. Beach at 20m. To go there you must not exceed 2m because you have to pass a tunnel"
91286,2023449,4,cfogo,30/06/2022,"parking to spend the night directly on the beach. from an entrance c, is the height limit you have to go around from another street. nearby train runs until midnight and then at 6am."
91286,1853617,5,Watson26,26/04/2022,"go around the bridge 1km south and you will have no height limit. Beachside, very little frequented (April). The train passes quite often, sensitive ears refrain"
91286,1686417,5,Zora777,12/11/2021,"Good van parking space, very quiet."
91286,1245408,3,reicheliciouss,09/06/2021,We could not access it because it is through a tunnel with a maximum height of 2m!
91286,1209361,1,Xamkabu,21/05/2021,Camping or taking a table is not allowed. THE POLICE FINE!
91286,1010939,5,guttysori,29/08/2020,"We spent the night there, roof raised without camping, another couple with chairs and a table outside for dinner and breakfast. The access where we enter is low, 2 meters, but I think it can be accessed from another car park. We were able to spend the night, no one told us anything. Train noise nearby, we slept well despite that and some group of young people who parked in the parking lot."
91286,645141,3,MTPS,20/08/2019,"Good location to spend a night if you are very tired and the noise of the trains does not bother you, they pass during the night too."
91286,534948,4,padraigl,01/07/2019,"This is a normal carpark beside the beach. There are no services. There are beach showers and some public toilets.
We encountered no mosquitos (don't know why. there is stagnant water in the carpark) which is a win win for us.

The police patrol regularly and they told a guy to take down his chocks under his front wheels, another guy with his motorhome overhang was impeding the parking space behind, to move to another space and another couple in a small van who were sitting out at their sliding door were told they could not do that in the carpark and had to pack up and sit in their van. 
Although a motorhome arrived Sunday and parked in the dirt area at the back, had their chairs, tables and awning out but the police hadn't drove by.
Once you are not impeding, park between the white lines, not out over the front and use the carpark space sensibility they don't mind you there.

The trains that run right behind are very noisy and they travel throughout the night. 
The bars stay open late and there are people constantly moving about."
91286,531053,4,BopBop,28/06/2019,"Quiet parking and lit by streetlights at night. We had a very good night. A motorhome of over two meters was next to us, so there is a way to get somewhere. Be careful the train line goes right behind the parking lot, it can make noise."
91286,312137,3,monster17,03/08/2018,Make less than 2m high. The municipal police passed several times and left us alone. Beautiful beach with shower

91356,1034340,4,HelenAndLuna,08/09/2020,"We parked in this beautiful wooded area with a clean lake for one night. There’s a small bar that’s open in summer, although the people there made me feel a little uncomfortable, but it was good for a glass of wine and to use the toilet. The parking was busy during the day but there was just us, another motorhome, and a car belonging to someone at the bar there over night. The roads to get to this area are quite narrow and the drivers in the area seem a little crazy, so be careful."

91396,1295107,2,loretomey,04/07/2021,"Finding a place in the summer season is difficult and more so on weekends. We managed to park on Saturday, we had a very busy night, the restaurants are next door and the beach full of people who ""camp"" on the sand until late, making a lot of noise."

91426,2951833,5,Seniah,11/07/2023,"Awesome location, not many spaces (only 1 or maybe 2) but absolutely worth it, as you sit by the lake with an absolutely stunning sunset over the hills. No facilities and rather tight access but easily doable with our 2.05m wide and 5.5m long van."
91426,2902329,4,philou47,28/06/2023,"According to the photos, depending on the height of the tide, the platform is reduced to 2 or 3 places. Too bad, because the place is superb. No shade, Internet goes very well."

91427,2934939,5,azidito,07/07/2023,"Very cool place with a lot of shade, a bar with a large terrace where you can eat or order drinks and take you to the motorhome. There are two pools, one of them is fluvial and the water for my taste was very cold. The other is chlorinated and it is necessary to wear a bathing cap. Both are free and very clean."
91427,1470788,4,canillu,17/08/2021,"Highly recommended, if you arrive early, I recommend the left side, shade almost all day, many people on weekends but being a large space does not bother, the river has easy accesses and the pool is very large, that is, cool water."

91427,918426,4,Toroblanco,01/08/2020,"Perfect site. The penalty is for the covid, the river pool is not full, but there is a chlorine pool and a river. Lots of shade and grass. To arrive with a vehicle higher than 2.50 once in the town DO NOT follow the river pool sign, 50 meters later turn left and you will pass a much higher arch."
91427,905718,2,Toroblanco,28/07/2020,"Can someone tell me how to get to this recreational area with a van of more than 2.50 meters, without going through the bridge? Thank you"
91427,897592,5,MariaJose333,25/07/2020,"Lots of trees. You can use the park facilities for free, with a swimming pool, tennis court, outdoor exercise equipment, plenty of grass and a river pool. Although today at least it is empty of water then unusable. My only but is that inside they do not allow dogs, but are we outside with our Juanita? under the trees and very comfortable. Then we will go to the river that is just less than 100 meters away and apparently there is a beach and you can swim. IN the enclosure there is a bar. Bar las cañas, very large with many tables under a tent outside. You can eat there or like us, order some fresh craft beers, tinto de verano and tapas and have it in the AC, we have taken out the chairs. The coffee is also very rich. It is very comfortable. Now at 16:30 27 °. But with air I quote and in the shade it is great ... Rest of Spain from 30 to 40 °."
91427,678897,5,mayro,06/09/2019,"We have been spending a late night, lovely place, near the river, toilets, free showers and a bar with very good attention. I recommend the village bakery and very friendly people. You can not ask for more."

91427,583364,4,Piolin,29/07/2019,"A perfect place. The parking area is wide and with occasional shade.

Not a lot of places to be flat but picnic tables, barbecues and not insignificant point: a water fountain. A 10min walk from the hotel bar allowing you to have a drink with a beautiful view. I spent two nights there with no problem!"
91464,3088283,5,KikoSuarez,06/08/2023,"Recreational area on the road that goes up to Angliru. It has 3-4 places where you can sleep flat on the grass, if there is no room, a few meters before there is a large and flat esplanade of land. Quiet night surrounded by cattle."
91464,2516474,4,Aranmeritus,08/12/2022,"The place is beautiful, we went to spend the day and we were alone, we only saw a couple of cars go by. There are no litter bins and it's quite windy but the views are spectacular! Be careful with the maps, it makes the path a bit confusing, it sent us the other way and we had to turn around because the road was uneven. Despite that, we recommend it, and I don't think there is a problem to stay overnight."
91464,2223780,4,uprootedvan,12/08/2022,"Absolutely breathtaking. Visited by horses upon arrival, they pottered about all chill unfazed by us.
Quite uneven ground but loads of space. Windy but not too bad.
4G drops in and out so we had to leave as we rely upon it. Gutted as STUNNING. 
BBQ/picnic area lovely."
91464,1994643,5,Minsche,20/06/2022,"Incredibly beautiful place! The journey was adventurous with our 7.5 t, but doable. Dream view over the mountains and valleys of the Parque Natural Las Ubiñas. Horses and cows are free here. We stood here udW alone. Only cyclists or cowherds pass. Collected a bag full of rubbish! Please keep this beautiful spot clean!!!"

91464,1099846,5,lsj96,20/10/2020,Awesome spot. really quiet through the week but can imagine it will get busy quick on a weekend. Warning do not take the RI-2 road through the final village it is really narrow and most vans will not fit. turn off the RI-2 onto the RI-5 with 3km to go which is much easier going. land can be a bit muddy if its been raining.
91464,1057864,5,thistimeoneway,19/09/2020,A dream of a pitch! You have a 360 degree view of the mountains. We were awakened by bells in the morning and stood among curious horses.
91464,988949,5,roadandlife,21/08/2020,"One pass, it is a recreational area with great views, it has barbecues and a large garbage can nearby. We slept for several days here and with the Angliru viewpoint area we could unload gray and black and load water for 5 euros all, which allowed us to stay longer"
91464,388432,5,jacky.balleux,06/10/2018,Actually superb 360 ° view. But beware the road to get there is the IR 5 following indications Areas creativa de Viapara.

91466,3257269,5,victorien45,04/09/2023,"We had a good experience in this area. I find the services offered rather comprehensive and accessible. Located 7 minutes (car) from the center of Albufeira and close to the N125, access is easy and quick while being close to several towns. The site is silent. I recommend."
91466,3226358,5,Dianaleonorjorge,27/08/2023,Well situated. Open until late.

91466,3144263,4,rangyroa,14/08/2023,"Spartan place but you get what you pay for! only one bathroom but clean. very wild outdoor showers! a paid hot shower! it was a good solution away from the chaotic and hot Albufeira,but still easily reachable by uber!"
91466,3143733,3,pascal76350,14/08/2023,"I put 3 stars because everything is not finished. We stayed 2 nights where everything went well. 2 adults, 1 teenager, electricity and water plus drainage and cassette for €15.50. the reception went very well on the phone and on site. satisfactory for a few nights and several restaurants around. we encourage the owner to go to the end of his projects."
91466,3135449,1,Laptitejule,13/08/2023,"Dishonesty does not stifle this woman who manages the Park and the services. we weren't able to drain our gray water during our last stop, so we found this service to drain it cleanly. This woman laughs in my face and asks me 4€ to empty my gray water. Too late, we have already opened our drain. Avoid, very bad image of Portugal!"
91466,3133088,1,chiflo,12/08/2023,"I give it one star because otherwise I can't comment. I get to do the services because I needed them urgently, I see a sign for €4, I pay them, I take out the pot, emptied it and when I go to rinse I see that the taps have a padlock, I tell him to open them and he tells me that another 4€ how? And he tells me yes, to empty it is €4 but if I want water it is another €4, €8 to empty the pot? Oh really ? I'm not coming back"
91466,3117526,3,allemontanari,10/08/2023,Quiet camper area under construction 15 minutes from Albufeira. We used the outdoor shower (although it has enclosed ones with hot water) and it only has one toilet available. Good solution to visit the city with Uber.
91466,3115227,5,FallObst,10/08/2023,"This place has charm! If you are looking for glamping, this is not the place for you. BUT: great value for money. Owner super friendly. There is an improvised outdoor shower with a cover. There is an indoor shower behind the cottage. We had a lot of space in the high season. Washing station is great - €10 for 18kg of laundry. top result. Small shop where you can also eat something. 12€ for van 2 persons!"
91466,3080227,5,Gudoldtom,05/08/2023,"Very nice place. Very quiet, lots of space and 10 mins by car from Albufeia. €12 per night inc electric, water, shower, toilet, waste station.

91466,2923604,3,alicialtne,04/07/2023,Convenient when you're not sleeping or at all hours. But on the other hand it's not 8€ without electricity but 12 €. The showers are extra and the only toilet very dirty.
91466,2626043,1,hansenannelies,27/03/2023,"Don't go here! This has nothing to do with a CP anymore. We did not feel safe among these residents. Unfortunately, you pay first and then you can drive up and see where you end up. Otherwise we would have been turned long ago"

In return, of course, we put a little more in the till. Two years ago we were passing through there and we really liked the friendly reception (back then from a man). Thanks very much! :)"
91466,2525151,2,Limbus,20/12/2022,"We spent two days in this square. The square is a bit neglected, the places are not numbered. For 90 declared parking spaces, there is one toilet and one shower. The vast majority of users seem to be permanently accommodated here. Not recommended for nomads."
91466,2500711,5,brasilandes,20/11/2022,We arrived late in the evening around 21:30. After visiting 3 other sites that were completely full. Unfortunately again the camping site was full however the owner let us free of charge stay in the parking park were we had a comfort spot to sleep. Thank you very much.

91466,1991657,4,AudreyHercher,19/06/2022,"Well thought out system but we need coins... €3 for evictions and drinking water. The site, with 3 eviction lanes, is outside the park's closed enclosure: we can go there at any time without depending on opening hours. I only gave it 4 stars because the gray water channel filled up quickly and was clogged. But I still recommend it... and it's not too far from the n125 road ;)"
91466,1853324,5,marthaconso,26/04/2022,"We went just to use the shower. Warm water. Friendly people, looked like a nice place to stay. Good experience"
91466,1797775,5,Stephye,27/03/2022,"No doubt very good for nomads who are more often sedentary than on the road! I was able to see the good family and friendly spirit of the occupants, most of them year-round. It's more of a subdivision than an area. I recommend the all-you-can-eat grilled meal on Friday evening at the bar / restaurant in the area, a delight!!! Luisa and Pedro are on top, thank you"
91466,1729879,5,lufizer,08/01/2022,Ideal supply and disposal place. Washing machines and dryers are also available. A small bar on the square makes delicious little meals at incredibly good prices. You can also sit in the sun and enjoy a coffee or beer. The place to stay overnight is more for the flodders.
91466,1728492,3,luanccp,07/01/2022,"Quiet place but with grumpy neighbors. I arrived with my family at 9 pm, I parked the motor home, I was getting ready for dinner and a man came shouting for us to be quiet. We put our things away and left the place. It has water and laundry facilities with easy access"

Too bad there is not too much room for nomads like us who stay there only a few days otherwise nice area and good atmosphere we recommend"
91466,1702678,4,ca56,04/12/2021,"Large motorhomes, trailers and cars. Plots fenced by year-round occupants who make their terrace, their garden and even their Christmas tree and lights (surprising). Good French and German atmosphere. Price 8 € / day and 1.5 € electricity optional."

91495,2694085,5,Roxymi,24/04/2023,Ideal parking space to park a large motorhome so that you can visit Nazaré.
91495,2524318,4,cathy-alain,19/12/2022,We found a place without problem with a cc 6m... The parking lot is in the ground but it should not be difficult because very close to the city center. Great for exploring the city on foot

91495,1986128,3,Nataliek89,17/06/2022,"Very good base for visiting the city. You are at the sea in 10 minutes. In our opinion, the parking lot is not in the forbidden zone. The parking space is located directly on the main street. Wanted to stay overnight to continue driving at night and ultimately decided against it and drove to a place an hour away."
91495,1691168,2,Alvespt,16/11/2021,This place is already in the prohibited area for Campervan’s so although you see lots of them parked it’s illegal to do so.
91495,1413518,3,davidbourgeois,06/08/2021,"We are there very well to go into town on foot, to sleep in my opinion not a good place in view of the road next door. to have."

91503,3274439,2,morris8a,08/09/2023,"In my opinion it is not worth it, the path is hard, quite bad and full of runes. There are good views up there but I think there are better places. We have gone."
91503,2921237,4,lShar,04/07/2023,"Amazing location with insane views of sunset and sunrise. Spent a very chill night, waking up to the best views in the morning. Gets extra cold at night - it’s super exposed. Not giving it 5 stars because of how complicated the road was."
91503,2878128,3,lesjerome2,21/06/2023,"very nice place but hard to get to. Impossible in a motorhome, complicated for a van, rather for 4x4"
91503,2872376,5,benjamileyes,19/06/2023,"Very good spot! Far from any road or urbanization, you only see mountains around you, with views of the entire Cerdanya at the bottom of the valley. No shade but with access to water. To get there you have to follow a track from the last town for about 10 minutes, the final part is full of stones and potholes, but it is done well if accompanied by good driving, not suitable for very low vans."
91503,2458331,4,4WDreamOffroad,23/10/2022,"Good place IF IT IS NOT WINDY! Two cars/vans fit and relatively easy to level, but if the wind blows it is very exposed."
91503,1889216,2,andrealmansa,14/05/2022,The views are cool but it's too windy to be outside quietly. Es campo In the end we decided to look for a better place to spend the night.

91503,1459861,5,zoubida33,15/08/2021,"I confirm that the way is not easy. Tight turns, from there pebble track in bad condition, slopes of 7 °, in short, I recommend 4x4 instead. Incredible point of view day and night. Small water channel that the dogs enjoyed. 10-20m above the point is more flat. Cows nearby. Very little traffic. A lot of wind that evening!"
91503,1228447,2,Lotte_W,31/05/2021,"Tried driving up there with my vw t4 '98 but decided halfway it wasn't worth it. went up with my friend in his smaller van, which was no problem. Looks like a great spot to spend the night but I didn't risk it in the end and chose for a spot 10 min down the road next to rhe river (which I would recommend for people that don't want to risk it)"
91503,1070828,5,Zythum,26/09/2020,"Great for the point of view, access without pb in VAN, compared to the gps point continue 20m on the path to find a place on the left that is more or less flat."

91503,833973,5,CaliPilot,23/06/2020,"Beautiful place, impressive wide view and nice landscape! The road is ok but only accessible for T5/6 like Vans due to very narrow places in the next village. A small stream with fresh water is next to the spot, my dog loved to take a bath there. The best part: almost no mosquitoes in late june!"
91503,731163,5,Karles4x4,27/10/2019,With a beautiful view of the whole Cerdanya.
91503,353457,5,chtigaby,25/08/2018,"Nice view, very peaceful. We put ourselves on the shelf just 10m above. The initial spot is on the entry of a field it is necessary to take a small secondary track about ten meters on the left. The main track is good, the only difficulty is the few small fords where we skate a little if we take them gently. In short all the vans pass without problem."
91523,1312814,5,lesgrossacados,11/07/2021,Frankly this place saved our stay in Madrid!

We chose the path directly at the yellow house and it worked. with walking pace and caution it works well. However, if it has rained, the path might be too muddy. Highly Recommended. KEEP IT CLEAN! ♥️"
91556,2578841,5,Duzifahrer,15/02/2023,"Beautiful pitch right on the water. Very windy. We stood here for two days, a shepherd and two couples with dogs were the only visitors. Pitch black at night."

Unfortunately, we were unlucky because we arrived late and it got so windy at night that we drove a bit higher in front of the hedge on the gravel parking lot. It was much quieter there and the van was no longer swaying :D"
91556,2351277,5,LoreDours,08/09/2022,Really nice spot but please don't take the road next to the yellow house we did it and it was a not so nice adventure and there's a much easier road

91556,653152,4,antoniocortesmacias,23/08/2019,ATTENTION!!!! The place is great but the location of Google Maps puts you in a mousetrap where to destroy the van. To arrive we take the next exits to the right and walk about 300 meters
91556,609831,5,innomansland,08/08/2019,"It's great, but as a partner has said, avoiding following the path proposed by Google Maps is a path for 4X4. Direct and easy access from the town."

From the village road it is better to enter through the next asphalted entrance that goes towards some chalets, shorter and much better."

We have a very tall 4x4 sprinter and we had to insert the reduced ones to maneuver in the sand. I strongly advise against those who have a normal camper or a camper with a low ground clearance not to come here.
91815,1031418,3,Arikrosenkranz,07/09/2020,"The access is very difficult. You have to drive about 6 minutes on dirt roads that are very narrow and unpaved. We just made it with a 6.5 meter long camper. At the destination, however, we got stuck more often, thanks to the incline we made it out without help, but this is definitely not the rule. The view is very nice and you can definitely stand there alone. Maybe you can do it with a higher VW bus with all-wheel drive."

With me there were 4 large motorhomes that had to stand across and thus took up 12 parking spaces. Since the place is a well-used leisure area, I hope that taking up so much space doesn't even become a nuisance. However, there was enough parking space."

But it was the best parking we could find for a longer stay in a waking distance to city centre. Training facilities next to the parking, with a playground and drinking water. It took us about 30 minutes to walk to the marina and 15 minutes to city centre. Trash bins available."
91846,1762435,3,statstar,21/02/2022,The large parking lot is on a hill in the middle of the city. The driveway goes uphill without any problems. We stood across a few car spaces. No problem because there is enough parking space. Cars come and go during the day until late at night. From 11pm it was quiet and we slept well.

91846,418274,1,Andaleon,31/12/2018,"When we arrived at the square last night at 7 pm, we first explored the area and looked for the possibility of getting water. In the stadium that was just closed, we found the toilets. The faucets of the sinks were too small to hold a watering can underneath. At the stadium were many homeless people. On the way back to the parking lot, we met various dubious figures, who did not let us feel comfortable on this place. We therefore avoided a parking lot just 1.5 km away, also featured at Park4night. In hindsight, a good decision."

A lot of noise! I thought I was in Spain. ;-) In order to only park the car here during the day, there is certainly a good parking space, but there is an extra star."

91857,392419,4,Elliiot74,13/10/2018,We were lucky that there is still a place on this small parking lot. Considering the size of the car park I do not recommend it for long vehicles because you have to park in a car place. Perfect location near the center and about 500m from the beach. Very calm night until the passage of bins early morning (containers on the parking). Thank you for this address

The place is a bit dusty, but also suitable for larger motorhomes. We were only about 100m further with our 7m van, the parking bays there were too short for us. There is a kiosk nearby that is open in the afternoon and public toilets (closed in the evening). There are some fitness machines right on the river. And a tour around the river, from bridge to bridge, is worthwhile. We spent a quiet night, I can recommend the place."

Restaurant super delicious, nice staff, price-performance ratio is just right. Guests are older on average and most are on the pitch more often and longer. You get to talk to a lot of people (English). Very pleasant stay (our age: late 20s). We'll be back!"
91949,1802480,5,Kwakaman,31/03/2022,Friendly and efficient welcome on arrival. Great clean facilities and a very nice restaurant and bar. Apparently usually full even in March but we were lucky and were offered a good choice of pitches. 10 minute walk to the beach and 15 to the town which was okay but very quiet and few choices of places to eat even on a Saturday night. Overall would definitely recommend.
91949,1721301,4,avecescarmen,31/12/2021,"very good facilities, small, clean and very well cared for. Very expensive wifi. great"
91949,1624971,4,aapages,03/10/2021,"Very good camping, spacious pitches, with all services in it. Much tree that provides shade. Quiet at this time. Nearby beach. Correct price for the services you have."
91949,1538837,4,jyp44,01/09/2021,"Campsite in town, close to shops and the beach. Great location, swimming pool. But it's too expensive: 58 € per day for 2, in a van plus electricity. Shouldn't you sell your van and go to the hotel ???"
91949,1471568,5,Udiarraga,17/08/2021,"5 star campsite !!!! very well located, with all kinds of services, activities for adults and children, near the beach, large squares and plenty. They have made a large investment in covid measures. Many families vacation there year after year as if it were a village. Even though there are children, you sleep great! yes, you pay ... high prices!"
91949,1446488,4,Tricasses,12/08/2021,"We stayed here for 3 nights. Very good campsite. Very clean and quiet. Close to everything on foot. No height problem and we are 3.50m. Lots of places available. We paid 89.40 € / night for 1 CC, 2 adults and 2 children electricity. A bit expensive I find. 5 star campsite but not worth it. 50 min / day of swimming pool only and no slide in it. Almost zero animation."
91949,1341192,5,Remolin,19/07/2021,"Excellent camping to visit Benicassim, the greenway, its beaches, ... it has a large supermarket opposite and you can walk to the center. The campsite has a heated indoor pool"
91949,1211387,5,Prito,22/05/2021,"Beautiful campsite near the beach and the greenway that runs from Benicasim to Oropesa. Very friendly staff. Super clean facilities and very good covid measures. Restaurant, swimming pools, three playgrounds, outdoor gym, laundry, doctor, hairdresser, picnic area, drinking water ... Spacious pitches separated by hedges. Mercadona opposite, very close to Lidl and Burger King. I'll be back for sure."

91949,1089859,5,varmente,11/10/2020,"Everything very clean. Very friendly staff. Good installations. covid measures so good that we have not had to be near anyone. The beach is very good, the bike path is very large and quite flat."

91949,890262,5,jomonga,22/07/2020,"It is true, it is not cheap, but, and as a consequence of the Covid, it is very well organized, services with extreme cleaning and disinfection, in addition, and for this reason, there are fewer people and it is really good"
91949,767070,5,ddehem,10/01/2020,"A very nice campsite, very clean, very welcoming. The price is reasonable. Very well located in relation to the city. The reception in several languages brings a plus."
91949,762727,3,IanHardy,03/01/2020,"This site was recommended by a friend so we thought it would be good. Unfortunately we were not that impressed. We stayed in December with kids, so the indoor pool was a big draw, the pool was dirty, broken tiles around it, also too small for the amount of people on site. The site was a bit tatty, work was taking place on one of the toilet blocks which is fair enough. Easy access  amazing beach."
91949,615707,5,misraersavas,10/08/2019,"This is the best campsite for caravans and motorhomes. Everything about it is perfect. First the staff is professional, polite and speaks English and other languages. When you get there, you can park your motorhome and have a look at the sites they have available and choose yourself. There is a restaurant with air conditioners inside and a seating outside. They have a fully equipped gym with air conditioning and a laundry, medic room, and a nursery for toddlers that does some activities. They have outdoor pool area and showers. The toilets and showers are clean and large. They have fresh water and a motorhome waste water place too. They rent bikes for you. There is a Macedonia supermarket right opposite and it is 5 mins to the beach. The beach is lovely and clean. Great for morning runs. Honestly after having awful experience in other places this is place is a bit of fresh air. It is not the cheapest but it is clean, quite and has everything you need."
91949,547718,1,xxjga,11/07/2019,"When there is no price list on the web and when I get there, I ask them for the price list and they tell me that they don't have anything, bad, bad. And of course it happens that they give me a price of € 40.25 (1 per + ac + elec) and when I leave they try to charge me at € 45.65. Is not it true that they have to have in view the price list ??? Be careful they will try to cheat you !!!"
91949,442388,5,cp,20/03/2019,"Camping at the top. Everything is perfect. Near the city, the beach, shops, bike paths. Sanitary impeccable. Very large sites. Only small problem, electricity a little expensive. But other than that, it's a really nice campsite."
91949,427399,5,jodo1,08/02/2019,Not on ACSI !expensive for short stay.
91949,409492,5,jenka,23/11/2018,A clean site with all the facilities and 2 supermarkets with in walking distance as is the town and beach. out of season represents the best value given the amount of facilities in the price .only negative as with many Spanish sites is the cost of electricity!
91949,400442,5,Bjork,28/10/2018,"Very complete camping. We were at the end of October and the campsite was almost full with many European retirees. Very quiet environment and facilities, very clean and new. If we travel through the area we will return."
91949,327037,4,makloud,11/08/2018,Very good campsite with efficient and helpful staff. A camper place with 2 adults and 2 children and electricity for 76 € per night places are large
91955,3227300,5,Jean-PierreCoz,27/08/2023,"We arrived by motorhome in January 2023 for 2 days and we stayed there for over a month. Friendly atmosphere, 90% of motorhome drivers are regulars at this campsite and are very respectful. Very well-cleaned toilets, welcoming and available staff and owners, kind words and big smiles. A paella with drink and dessert offered and served very friendly."
91955,2904308,3,VicSar,29/06/2023,"Pros: Quiet nights. Attentive and friendly staff. Shade. Close to the beach, less than 5 minutes on foot. Route of the Greenway almost at the door. Pool Cons: Somewhat outdated. Most available pitches are not level. The trees drop some fruits that stain everything, motorhome, awning, raffia floor... We leave our shoes outside. We will be back"
91955,2607388,2,MiMaDa,12/03/2023,"Very old sanitary facilities, small toilets and showers. Pitches partly very unkempt. Playground is outdated. Nevertheless, we spent two quiet nights. Short distance to the beach. Good shopping opportunities, as supermarkets are within walking distance."
91955,2544181,4,Beat.M,06/01/2023,"Friendly staff, clean toilets and showers. Proximity to bike path and beach."
91955,2514261,2,Hansfranz5,06/12/2022,A very dated campsite. You can see that not a lot of money was invested in maintenance. There are a large number of long-term campers who meet at the weekend in winter to have fun. The place only becomes cheaper after a 30-day stay. Various nations campers use this opportunity.
91955,2490605,1,Pakadoudou,11/11/2022,"Camping in the city center, constant road noise. Next to the campsite constructions therefore works, building site and noises. Big camping chain, no friendliness. We were to stay 2 days the day after we left. The icing on the cake we are stopped in front of the exit barrier, when we had just paid at the moment. For a price of 28.40"
91955,2447788,5,Migueloide,17/10/2022,Well located and communicated. near beach and greenway. Very attentive staff. Thanks to Eva for her professionalism
91955,2257346,2,hemos,17/08/2022,Great location on the beautiful sandy beach. Very narrow pitches with no privacy. Very large place with many permanent campers. pool dirty. Everything seems loveless and unkempt. Food in the restaurant rather simple. Reception impersonal. 2 adults 2 children 1 mobile home including electricity 57€/night. Isn't worth the price.
91955,2255342,1,maiteatu,17/08/2022,"The campsite is quite old and neglected. The pool is big but it is dirty and there is not a single hammock or grass. The staff is friendly but they don't give enough... It took us forever to open the lock on the electrical panel for the light. The only good thing is that it is next to the beach and the greenway. Overall quite expensive for what it is. 2per, 1 night with electricity €46"
91955,2244198,2,azimut,15/08/2022,"Old and abandoned campsite, very low trees and very fair plots. The only good thing about the beach, the town of Benicasim is quite far away, there is a bus stop very close."

91955,1814149,5,wolfi128,10/04/2022,Very friendly staff. Well located. Going down the street from the campsite there is the start of the bike route and the start of the maritime pass. In our case they plugged us in at all.

The prices are at sight. The security guard very well tb. Acsi card."
91955,1742552,4,Congers354,28/01/2022,"Rustic large camping and caravan site with good facilities. Large pitches good for 8 or 9 meter motorhomes. Perfect for exploring Benicassim which looks lovely. 
Pitches are not well maintained and are generally hard packed dirt but are level. 
For winter it is a great 4 day stop for us at about 22€ per night. 
Lidl just up the road. Great for cycling."

If you are looking for a campsite in this area, I can definitely recommend it. We are negatively surprised by other campsites in the area. Had a very nice holiday!"
91955,566239,1,Mazouzi,21/07/2019,Noisy camping. The prices are not given and for our case they came back on so-called free things. The pool opens at 11:30 ....
91955,524216,2,mialan,22/06/2019,Location of the campsite very well. Beaches and access to a beautiful bike path. Calme. Locations more suited to a caravan than a camper. Delimitation and summary soils Sanitary facilities including dilapidated showers and no hot water for dishes. Children games on dangerous cement in case of fall. You can not leave before 9 am because the staff must come unplug.

91979,1913830,2,Segelhexe,25/05/2022,"Simple parking lot, relatively level in some places, between the forest and uninhabited houses. Loved by walkers and athletes. Motorway runs nearby, audible. We didn't see any canals, an old tunnel has its entrance here. Starting point for hikes"
91995,3287803,4,senorkimyo,12/09/2023,The parking spot itself is amazing. If you park in the evening or morning you're able to get a spot and have a quiet night. It's really close to a beautiful coast. However the water at that coast is filled with algae and sometimes smelly.
91995,3218820,5,CorsarioCM,26/08/2023,"Great place, very close to services and the beach, if you are lucky you get one of the places near the pine tree and you have shade all day, spectacular views of the tower, very quiet."

91995,3197042,5,jcanalitos,22/08/2023,Exceptional place. Enough room and other van. Something uneven. Children's playground and 3 or 4 restaurants. It's a pity that the cove doesn't have showers.

91995,1865126,4,KarryB,02/05/2022,"I recommend arriving in the morning before 10am or in the evening after 6pm. Great location, right on the beach. When you're down on the beach, there's a hiking trail to the right that leads up to a really pretty cove. At that time very busy place, almost mass tourism. The night was calm."

The Germans in the area began to yell at us that camping here is illegal (our car with German registration) we had nothing outside, the police had passed before without telling us anything. I have just hated this site. I do not recommend it? The beach extremely crowded."

I want to thank the Italian girl and her boyfriend who was German for their cordiality, as they were leaving the next day and they provided us with a lot of food that they were not going to spend, thank you with all my heart."
91995,1509373,5,pedro.vlc,25/08/2021,"Very nice place, with good access to the cove 12 minutes to get to the cove with a moderate staircase, the cove is very beautiful but too crowded, scarce parking issue, you have to come around 8:00 p.m. to be able to park, a 6:30 car fits well In the squares, to get to the cove from the parking lot you have to walk back along the sidewalk where you came from until the restaurant on the left."
91995,1504998,4,mariagitani,24/08/2021,We have spent the night today and the site is super good. we were quite a few vans and ACs. Cala Pi is a 5-minute walk away and it's amazing! And there are a couple of bars next door that are very good. the only downside; the heat we've been through but that's what it is!
91995,1491108,4,agurrutxaga91,21/08/2021,Quiet place to sleep next to a tower and a restaurant. The cove is 5 min walk.
91995,1460935,3,rcortejosa,15/08/2021,"Let's say it is not bad, little shade, many cars and access to the beach is through a staircase that is further away. The cops arrived around 9 but we had nothing out so it happened. To stop, without more, there are much better places, to take 4 postureti photos if"
91995,1387387,5,vavdu37,31/07/2021,Perfect place! First night at the top! You just have to find a place: D
91995,1259480,5,Valeria1994,17/06/2021,"Perfect for sleeping, in front of a very beautiful cove. there is a restaurant in front. We have spent the night very quiet without noise. there is a garbage next to it. On June 17, 2021, we slept with only two more vans Highly recommended."
91995,1257326,3,stelvio,15/06/2021,Pleasant and magnificent view but this night of June 14th to 15th I didn't sleep much because the young people on vacation are noisy late at night.
91995,1243057,4,souarmh,08/06/2021,Pleasant even if the place is really very touristy.
91995,1194912,5,Mabri100,13/05/2021,Great view. Quiet during curfew. Great for one night.
91995,1106317,4,Ms.Penni,26/10/2020,"Beautiful spot, close to the sea and beach of cala pi. supermarket and restaurants in 2 minutes walking.
fills ups quite quick during the day due to day visitors."
91995,1003054,4,TheMiplesCamper,26/08/2020,Parking lot directly on the cliff. Great panorama ... a lot going on in the evening. Opposite is a well-frequented restaurant. Dustbin available. The beach is a 10-minute walk away.
91995,945732,5,ikerlee,10/08/2020,A spectacular site! We spent the night very quiet !! We will return to this place without a doubt.
91995,916577,4,BOXLIFEMEN,01/08/2020,"Quiet urban parking at night, near the cove and with access to an old watchtower."
91995,824979,5,JuanmaT1,14/06/2020,"Very quiet, beautiful and with a lot of space"
91995,757281,5,lisi99,26/12/2019,A very good place to sleep. Quiet and without noise. There is room for a 6 m caravan
91995,713614,4,ludivan,05/10/2019,"Quiet place with great views, during the day it is full of cars, but at night there is hardly any traffic. It has a playground. You have restaurants and supermarket very close. The only downside is that the access to the beach are many stairs."
91995,655697,4,alexandrebispo28,24/08/2019,"The place is quiet, with space for large motorhomes! The view waking up and the evening is spectacular!"
92010,2661195,3,pirate.riot,11/04/2023,"The place is really only suitable for small vehicles. You don't have the opportunity to turn around on the pitch and you have to reverse out of there, which isn't that easy. Opposite the square, on the other side of the river, there is another small square where you can also park with large vehicles. However, it is rather simple, but also had a quiet night there."
92010,1800027,4,aymericdaudel,29/03/2022,Very nice spot but we only give 4 stars because of the somewhat complicated access by motorhome (small very steep and paved roads)
92010,1672502,5,nelegabsschon,01/11/2021,We stood here one night with no problems. a cold bath in the river in the morning. great place :)
92010,348960,5,oscarandus533,22/08/2018,Excellent!
92014,1251513,1,Neusenberlingo,13/06/2021,"There is a house near which two people came out to take pictures of us, they said that it was their private path and that we couldn't be there because the campsites are to sleep. I suppose that if no one is there, it is a good place, but we went to the viewpoint that is very close."
92015,3202221,5,Benatgar,22/08/2023,"We use this car park to spend the day at Saturraran beach, which is less than 10 minutes away. The beach has a few spaces for ACs but in summer they are usually busy"
92015,3191204,4,pataliebre,21/08/2023,"Ugly, but well located, 1 minute walk from the DIA supermarket, no noise at night."
92015,3184810,5,Crisss79,20/08/2023,"Perfect place of passage. We have coincided that it was Saturday, and we were only 2 more campers but very quiet. I don't know how it will be during the week. Just behind the Dia and 5-10min from the Santurraran beach."
92015,2672002,5,demafool,15/04/2023,Free parking next to DÍA supermarket. Right next to it there is a gas station where you can fill up with water for free
92015,2333547,5,JoseAgueda,03/09/2022,"Super quiet area of the polygon, if you go in a large Camper or Motorhome you cannot sleep in the parking lot on the beach but you can sleep here two minutes away, super comfortable"
92015,2188555,5,DavidSarri,07/08/2022,"Very good place to park and spend a calm and quiet night. You can park in the Día supermarket parking lot, but we did it in the polygon behind the supermarket. More calm here. The entrance says Polígono Mijoa. The very beautiful beach of Saturraran very close to 7 minutes walk. From this car park we made a 2 and a half hour round trip to Mutriku."
92015,2124471,4,denispatou,26/07/2022,Very quiet parking for one night
92015,2070911,4,RocioMG,14/07/2022,"we parked our H3L4 on the side of the day supermarket, we did the shopping and from there we walked to the beach."
92015,1372013,4,airam23,27/07/2021,"Quiet at night, if you arrive in the afternoon you will find a place without problem during the day it fills up with people who go to the beach. We stayed the night from Saturday to Sunday and perfect. The views are therefore those of a polygon, but it is a walk from Saturrarán."
92015,1253272,4,frankiebigface,13/06/2021,"Great place to park if the car park at the beach is full, only a short walk across the road to the lovely beach. Garage has a deli and dia supermarket there too"
92024,3273926,4,chloeledoux,08/09/2023,"very nice spot: sea view, away from the city. there were several campers so we parked right below the restaurant. it was perfect."
92024,3180667,5,mathieudax,19/08/2023,"Terrible view when waking up, 3 sites available in the same place for different sizes. Beach below, Guitoune with alcoholic beers and tapas on site. Note that the 2m limitation on one of the car parks is incorrect, Marco Polo which rises to 2m10 passes wide we must be around 2m30"
92024,3125093,4,PalmiraSantin,11/08/2023,"They have set a height limit of 2m, and have turned it into a parking lot. The campers can access. Very nice place to sleep. Before the limitation we fit about 4 vans / motorhomes"
92024,3047059,5,flechiE7,30/07/2023,"Quiet place to sleep, you can hear the sea, we were very comfortable. Capacity for 4 vans or for a couple of motorhomes."
92024,3004606,5,NatSchie,22/07/2023,Very nice place with a great bay and a great beach bar with friendly staff and reasonable prices. We stayed there for three nights with no problems.
92024,3003545,4,Simbayeah,22/07/2023,"A very beautiful and quiet place, we could even find a small waterfall. But without services and to access the beach area maximum 2 meters high. Still there are some places before the limitation. To spend a while or a good night, it is good to bathe and enjoy the place. There is a restaurant."
92024,2406949,4,GeofFLM,27/09/2022,"Very pretty spot, quiet earlier. A few surfers and tourists but really not bothersome. Very pleasant sound of the sea. Three spots are possible. One limited to 2m and two others on the dyke side for the big ones."
92024,2247382,4,Ivanpalmaserrano,16/08/2022,Good place but they only allow 2m. We went to the path that is higher than if they allow.
92024,2230133,4,sari.87,13/08/2022,"Good place to spend the night. Too bad the limitation of 2 meters to get closer to the beach, but still highly recommended."
92024,2223079,5,IVECO35C13,12/08/2022,Secure parking space right on the water. Fresh water refill option via canister. showers and a waterfall. I found space for my 7m long and 3m high iveco.
92024,2215039,5,S.Grande,11/08/2022,"great, retirees traditionally set up their beach bars on the fence, they don't hold us in high esteem but they don't make it too obvious. dogs swim until September 15 (I don't remember the exact day). The beach for dogs in the loading area is a short walk away but it is a poo, with fat boulders, on a slope and small, they cannot even walk comfortably and lying on a towel is impossible."
92024,2125442,4,Gina0107,26/07/2022,"Very nice, quiet place with a beautiful view. Right on the beach there is a height limit of 2.20m, but if you drive up the road a little bit, you will come to another small parking lot with no height limit. No toilets or services (except for a beach shower) but a nice place to stay for one night."
92024,2022931,4,JeAlexOtto,29/06/2022,Fantastic! Flat parking with views of the Playa. We were in the company of 2 other vans. Too bad a car arrived late at night with a gentleman who spent hours walking here and there with a phone to his ear (he didn't seem to be talking) . He peeked inside the vans including us. Disturbing but for some luck he decided to leave. Thoughtful but in the end he slept peacefully
92024,1823690,5,lopeid,15/04/2022,"very quiet and clean place, recommended"
92024,1632263,4,DanielAcevedo,08/10/2021,Very good views but a little uneven terrain. Perfect to spend a quiet night. I also recommend the Pan.Menesa bakery in the town where we were treated very well and the croissants and palm trees were very tasty.
92024,1551040,2,TaniaSerrano,05/09/2021,"We could not enter due to the height limitation of 2 meters. It is annoying that you see van friends who could be within that height and take places from the rest. Who has a chance to spend the night, it seemed like a spectacular place."
92024,1521024,1,bateauenmer,27/08/2021,Do not venture into a campsite because we put a height limitation of 2m too bad every year I spent 2 3 days there it was great
92024,1486798,5,NoraCarlos,20/08/2021,We had a great night!
92024,1472487,5,Eztakatizenik,17/08/2021,"You can not camp but all the vans had outside the table, chairs and camping gas. We had no problem.Good place, good atmosphere. Lots of van."
92024,1422970,5,anderarzamendi,08/08/2021,Very quiet and great for sleeping. In the morning the Civil Guard came and they didn't tell us anything.
92024,1329741,3,vagabundavan,16/07/2021,Before reaching the 2 meter gauge there is a small area where 6 vehicles can fit. Perfect for spending the day at the beach.
92024,1249278,5,ezkurrajokin,11/06/2021,"A spectacular site, with views of 10 and in the chiringuito they give delicious sandwich rations, we will spend from Friday to Sunday in a California"
92024,1059042,1,pmdei,19/09/2020,2m height limitation
92024,1033113,3,Aventurac,07/09/2020,Not suitable for motorhomes or large vehicles. Very narrow and difficult passage to cross with any other vehicle. There were no places either.
92024,1002848,3,bateauenmer,25/08/2020,Very good great view a little overcrowded during the day but in the evening return to calm
92024,789941,5,dbol26,02/03/2020,"Stunning views! two potential spots to park, one right at the beach front with bright lights when you turn right or turn left to go round to a little spot without lights where you can walk around to a crane past a blocked off walk way, very cool! previous comments was right though it is a bit dirty from what people leave behind! theres even bins which makes even less sense for people to leave rubbish"
92024,732065,1,nacotoy,28/10/2019,"Bring your cans if you want to refuel. The Basque country is deplorable for infrastructure. no area or very dirty. For water, almost nothing if it is oval taps on which we can not connect. find a terminal, but with tokens, to take or ?? mystery and parking squat by cars"
92024,576461,4,gamarra,26/07/2019,Good site facing the sea. We spend the night with other motorhomes before passing the bridge that leads to the beach and has limited height. Recommended if you do not match kids who come to hang out.
92024,551499,5,Hymeralca,13/07/2019,Excellent location although it is forbidden camping the civil guard step and despite that there were several motorhomes with tables and chairs said nothing. The access is not complicated although there is a narrow section with double meaning that complicates it a bit. There are toilets and showers but it can not be emptied or filled. We spend day nights with views of the beach that I will keep in my retina. There is also a kiosk that makes some very good rabas.
92024,529932,4,Carqueixa,26/06/2019,"Good place to spend the night or day, there are showers and containers, access with AC is not bad, you have to cross a bridge to access, eye especially when leaving"
92024,474148,2,edmoni,02/05/2019,Very dirty place with rats but you could sleep. We moved to a nearby place.
92024,364835,5,kiki2311,04/09/2018,"Easy access, supervised beach"
92025,1293779,5,EliBiel,03/07/2021,"We have made a stop along the way, without spending the night. Great pools and good food in the bar. Recommended in summer. There is place to park."
92025,616264,3,cametes76,10/08/2019,Next to the cemetery .. very trankilo ..
92025,394526,3,killkerra,16/10/2018,Ample parking next to a sports area. with a bar where to have something or to eat. to spend a night of urgency. the road is traveled so it is better to park in the land area.
92036,3252808,5,James1998,03/09/2023,Very pretty park up. Spent day at beach and could see van which gave peace of mind. Few restaurants and bars around which we visited and all locals where very friendly. Quiet night and really nice sunset from van
