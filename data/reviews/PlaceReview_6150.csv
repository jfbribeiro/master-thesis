78995,978592,4,soliloquydiaries,18/08/2020,"Nice view and lots of shadow, but unfortunately fully packed."
78997,1755912,3,rvanvugt,14/02/2022,Small parking area ideal for one night. Quiet during the night but becomes noisy in the morning when the few habitants of the village leave for their work and the garbage trucks come to emtpy the containers. Direct access to the Mar Menor with some walking paths around. Keep the area clean and avoid camping- behaviour.
78997,1702630,4,TDausend,04/12/2021,"Simple pitch with plenty of space, perfect for a night in transit, when it's gotten late and you don't want to go any further. We stood there alone on a Friday evening. It was totally quiet, sunny in the morning. Dumpster on site."
78997,1670754,2,ViajeroPol,31/10/2021,"Desolate parking, dirty and had a bad feeling. I drove on and didn't sleep over"
78997,1140340,3,EdithGueffroy,21/02/2021,"The place is ok. However, I would have been alone, so I keep going. The navigation system got me wrong."
78997,914901,5,Etich,31/07/2020,Very quiet parking 100mts from the beach. It has no services but you have the town next to July 30 and it is going alone (although this year is all weird).
78997,772326,3,Jendavidge,25/01/2020,"Lovely place to stop but we were approached by some strange characters and as we’d heard that a car had recently been broken into, we did not stay as we were the only ones there and it is a little isolated."
78997,470417,4,Maxmax52,28/04/2019,Alone
78997,357211,3,jgallego,28/08/2018,We spent one night with two more AC's. Very quiet and a minute from the seafront. Area without services for the car but with the population next to buy what you need.
78999,3141074,1,MariaJesus98,13/08/2023,"The access is super dangerous and difficult. There is no point where you can turn around. Super narrow roads, unpaved, many slopes. We have gone through an ordeal to get there and finally we could not stay since we did not see where to stop or there were other vehicles. Please don't go to this place."
78999,3125130,2,elmundodemagec,11/08/2023,"Quite shabby and busy, but it fulfills its function to quickly enter the Chillar river, a water path that, if you take it on a bad day, can seem like La Rambla de Barcelona."
78999,2822733,5,toutate,05/06/2023,ideal for hiking
78999,2817867,4,ProjektNo4,04/06/2023,"Ideal as a starting point for the hike through the Rio Chillar (do not turn back too early, the water is dammed up after about 1-2 km, from there it is beautiful, completely dry beforehand). Also to explore Nerja very well located, as outside of the hustle and bustle and yet not far away. The place itself is quite trivial, the highway is audible but not annoying. Haven't stayed there."
78999,2783800,5,Bennilein,25/05/2023,Mega entry to the river hike very friendly residents and workers definitely doable for one night a lot of noise a lot of cars traffic the electricity costs from the voltage system the highway still 5 points because thanks that there are still public places like this
78999,2514708,3,Pananda,06/12/2022,As a parking lot to do a great river hike impeccable. I wouldn't sleep here. Be sure to drive from the east road out of Nerjar!
78999,2491405,3,Kolber01,11/11/2022,I don't know what different people call quiet? Almost below the highway bridge and a constant drive by cars and motorbikes even when it's dark. The space is not suitable for larger vehicles than 6.5m long.
78999,2490116,3,Walter676,10/11/2022,"Very quiet and very dusty!!!! Please be sure to take one of the 2 direct access roads from Nerja, all other roads (from the interior or parallel to the motorway) are absolutely borderline and hardly passable even for a 6m van!!!!"
78999,2422190,4,victorAst,04/10/2022,We spent a quiet night the day before the route. Perfect place for it. 4G coverage. a lot of dust
78999,2218274,4,paulaundsamiontour,11/08/2022,"The place is ideal if you want to do the Rio Chillar hike. We stayed one night, some dog walkers pass by, otherwise it is relatively quiet."
78999,1882653,3,FranBoard,11/05/2022,Stayed further down the road closer to town. No problems. Quiet at night apart from the dogs.
78999,1870079,2,3pleL,04/05/2022,Easy access with a L2H2 van. Overall a nice place but too public. We didn’t stay.
78999,1864347,2,RobertoSilvia,01/05/2022,"Place to spend a night. start of a very nice walk along the shrill river, but there is no water. Some traffic because there are many country houses nearby and the motorway bridge can be heard. During the day many bikers pass by making a lot of noise."
78999,1678747,4,Mssmaris,05/11/2021,"We didn’t park here because there were some dogs strolling around, but wanted to put a note that with our 7m camper we could drive here (slowly) and turn around perfecto."
78999,1256564,4,VanFather,15/06/2021,Great place to park to hike the chillar and spend the night. Bit of noice from the bringe right on top. But not too bad. Part of river chillar running next to the car
78999,1238841,3,Samfoc,06/06/2021,Place to spend some night. start of a very nice walk along the chillar river. Some traffic because there are many country houses nearby and the highway bridge is heard something.
78999,1073664,1,emeline60,28/09/2020,"Access very very difficult, even impossible for a 7m motorhome we managed to turn around very difficult I strongly advise against !!"
78999,942371,2,voyageursdeBretagne,09/08/2020,"Area that seems quiet, but a lot of traffic all night. Walkers who test motorhomes to visit them afterwards. Dogs barking all night long. Lots of mosquitoes. Nerja does not welcome motorhomes well."
78999,865042,5,spiegelbeagle,13/07/2020,"Pros: Well shaded until 8:45am in mid July; nearby Creek for the dogs and beautiful for a walk; ponies hitched to a cart passed by occasionally. :) It's a pretty spot.
Cons: the road was used by recreational off-roading vehicles until early evening so there was some noise as they occasionally passed, but it wasn't too bad."
78999,723583,5,chloejones2012,17/10/2019,Shaded area. A few cars and mopeds drove by but no problem. Road above but not really noisy at night.
78999,259784,5,gabriekry,27/05/2018,"Ideal for campers no longer than 6m. Quiet even during the night. By day, busy with locals and tourists who make the chimney de rio chillar"
79003,3151462,5,isavanfretti,15/08/2023,We have spent 2 very quiet nights on the seashore with incredible views to see the sunrise. It does not have any type of service but it has some containers nearby to be able to throw the garbage. It's a 50 minute walk to the center of Santa Pola. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
79003,2687449,5,Berbel01,22/04/2023,Here you can really spend the night wonderfully.
79003,2647773,4,jipe30,07/04/2023,"perfect for one (or more...) night. On the ""earth"" side, a beautiful space, a little uneven but rolling, allows the 7m to settle down without disturbing anyone. Let's use the trash!!"
79003,2609657,3,cindyy66,14/03/2023,"Along the entire coast, far too many campers. You will not be alone here. Obviously the coasts of Spain do not experience off seasons. A lot of wind. There are bins all along, so there is no need to put your trash in the ones that are full. Thank you for respecting the places"
79003,2609082,4,ARNMANDI,14/03/2023,"We spent one night, without noise, quiet and very comfortable Space for 3-4 motorhomes fair, but very nice"
79003,2607967,4,Mitu,13/03/2023,"Beautiful place. During the day and especially at the weekend, the road is a little busier. It's pretty quiet at night though. I spent a pleasant weekend here, always with a view of the sea. On the other side there are good paths for walking the dog. I'm thinking of coming back after a few errands!"
79003,2580549,5,CarolaLiden,17/02/2023,"This is my third time here, there is always a free spot, nice neighbourghs and the panarorama over the ocean, is amazing!"
79003,2548760,5,pescadoWRC,11/01/2023,"We spent one night and it was great. Two large ACs fit into this space, later there are other places with more space but no 4G connection. The sunrise views are fabulous. The fact of being next to the road was not a problem to be able to sleep."
79003,2514721,3,FuxInTheBox,06/12/2022,"Actually a beautiful place - but we drove from place to place indicated by P4N along the road, it smelled like poop everywhere. Used toilet paper everywhere, shards, cans, rubbish... it's not always the campers who cause it - if it is, it's a shame :("
79003,2328719,4,dburgosr,01/09/2022,"good views of the sea and the island. no problem sleeping one night. It was not completely clean, and cars pass all night, but they do not bother."
79003,2067891,5,MartinMuzik,13/07/2022,Quiet during night. 10m from sea. Most amazing place for us from whole trip around Portugal and Spain.
79003,1960360,4,elgriegonet,09/06/2022,Nice place but unstable 4G Vodafone/Orange coverage. The only part where at least 4G is better compared to all the rest of the beautiful places in this area
79003,1944363,5,blitz21,04/06/2022,We could easily stay overnight. The police passed us several times during the day. Perfect spot for relaxing and snorkeling! Don't leave rubbish behind.
79003,1722367,5,CRV_Spain,01/01/2022,Site highly recommended.
79003,1299826,4,ChescoBueno,05/07/2021,"Good view by the sea, but also right next to the road (however after a certain hour there was no longer too much traffic). In our case, no police or anything appeared and we spent the night quietly about 6 or 7 vans."
79003,1119432,5,debwilliams,05/12/2020,"Lots of motorhomers here great views ,"
79003,410856,2,JuergenD,29/11/2018,"No prohibition sign, but very close to the road"
79003,380479,3,larryette,23/09/2018,"Many people, not many places"
79003,342918,5,pilote08,19/08/2018,very beautiful place between sea and mountain thank you to this city to tolerate and let the caravan camping has a quiet night
79037,1797646,4,dsteve,27/03/2022,In one can fill the water (not drinkable) and empty the gray water. ok the road is next but frankly I've seen worse
79037,1750306,4,VoyagerNCC74656,08/02/2022,Good spot for large vehicles. A bit of noise from the A92. Beautiful view.
79037,1744959,5,gillesmaillard,31/01/2022,"absolute recommendation, you have to park at the end of the car park to reduce the noise of the road flat parking ideal for the night 360° view"
79037,1740977,4,manny_la_belle_vie,25/01/2022,"flat parking, great view. possibility of having water and emptying at the station. negative: from here you can't go hiking in the desert because ""private property"" we tried going through a path without signs but a man came and told us that it was forbidden to walk here. ..it is absurd that a natural park is not accessible and that it is private."
79037,1680158,4,ML35,06/11/2021,We only stayed there to do the hike. No problem
79037,1678057,5,5OnTheRoad_Amel,04/11/2021,Large flat parking lot with breathtaking views of the desert. Breathtaking sunset. Not bothered by the road that passes just behind. About ten vans and motorhomes were with us but the place is big enough to be really far from each other. To recommend.
79037,1669631,4,Jessan,30/10/2021,Good place to spend the night with beautiful views (we saw mountain goats). The night we spent we were accompanied by several ACs and several campers. Recommended.
79037,1628633,4,unapersona,05/10/2021,Very large esplanade next to the gas station. Several routes to do around. The staff at the gas station very friendly.
79037,1509175,5,hoppiness,25/08/2021,"Magnificent place, breathtaking view. We spent the night here with two vans, we sleep very well. There is a lot of wind but it wasn't a problem. The gas station and restaurant were the set for Black Mirror's “Black museum”"
79037,1446899,4,FabienP,12/08/2021,"Presented as behind a gas station, it does not make you dream. But actually, great. Lots of flat space with a breathtaking and superb view. Only negative points: wind and dust and a little noise from the highway, which takes away the 5th star. We had a good (hot) night with another van."
79037,1359242,4,Curry123,24/07/2021,"Stunning views by day and night. We sleep alone, I do not know if it is safe or not, but we want to sleep on the roof of the motorhome so as not to miss the views and the sky."
79037,1358814,4,txiki1026,24/07/2021,Beautiful place to spend a quiet night and close to the Oasys Minihollywood park. Waking up with views of the Tabernas desert is well worth it!
79037,1218349,4,LiseCoco54,25/05/2021,"Magnificent view of the desert, toilets nearby and plenty of room to park! We had a very good night, but be careful to take earplugs, you can hear the highway a little and there were strong winds."
79037,1192587,5,SebastianChristoph,11/05/2021,"An excellent, clean and quiet place. Right next to a gas station with a clean toilet. However, we had VERY strong winds during the night - you have to accept that. Therefor a great view and sunset. You hardly hear the street and it is quiet in the evening. Clear recommendation (with ear plugs for wind)"
79037,1185425,5,Annhnter,04/05/2021,"Stayed here last night 3rd may, a little traffic noise but not too intrusive. Garage workers very friendly, toilets locked but you can get keys when garage is open no trouble. Good spot for a days hiking in the desert ?"
79037,1152647,2,betterworldTr,16/03/2021,"Fantastic place, but nobody stays here, we didn't want to stay here overnight alone."
79037,1138345,5,IsaetMehdi,17/02/2021,A magnificent view from this parking lot.
79037,1095809,5,realvanlife,16/10/2020,"Ideal. Flat, large site, with views, and the beginning of some highly recommended walks in the area to travel to the far west in just a couple of hours of walking. It seems incredible that we have this type of landscape so close ..."
79037,1015975,5,kiryan,31/08/2020,"Great site, wonderful views. Jose the gas station boy is a walking encyclopedia of the filming that has been done in the area. In that cafeteria and gas station they filmed ""the black museum"" of Black Mirror."
79037,845908,1,porterosbe,03/07/2020,"Repsol gas station with the appearance of being abandoned, without gas, without water, laundries in poor condition, the staff say good morning and it seems bad, it bothers them that you go to work. BETTER AVOID I ADVISE YOU"
79037,797432,3,family04,26/03/2020,"23.01.2020. Fairly close highway (noisy), WC sometimes open, garbage cans. Very nice view but not really a walk (or very short) possible in the immediate vicinity because private property and open hunting. We were kindly asked to turn around, too bad, it's so beautiful ... there were 7 campers that night."
79037,783587,4,isaway,20/02/2020,"Absolutely sublime, free, sunset and sunrise to fall, clear and starry night. a little road noise but really not annoying, toilets and water at the gas station where people are very nice and we get the A92 for Seville right away"
79037,776048,4,TONIMAR,04/02/2020,"Very good place to spend the night, especially if you have company, because there is no light. Quiet and no noise. The place is very pretty, desert type of Tabernas"
79037,775123,2,S13,01/02/2020,"Spectacular view of the region but thats about it. Anyone who says this is a quiet place hasnt been to a truly quiet place. Lots of traffic, all night long. Maybe the wind was blowing from the wrong direction, who knows... So, good for a quick overnight stop, but nothing else."
79037,768273,5,Forcha1958,13/01/2020,What a landscape - from sunrise to sunset it is BEAUTIFUL
79037,768239,3,Dijanx,13/01/2020,Large area behind the Repsol services. water at tap but nothing else. garage sells nothing much. Good jet wash and gangtry for roofs of motor home. quite here after dark and very little road noise. we said hello to chap in services and let him know we were here

79037,515575,5,Natou014,14/06/2019,"I asked the gentleman of the station to stay overnight by buying water and he told me that we are ""Welcome""! We hear the traffic but it calms down with the night and the view is top. Very good spot after a trek of 3 hours of the desert."
79037,453508,4,JoseAntonio101,13/04/2019,"Incredible views and very quiet, in the morning a lot of cars but perfect for sleeping"
79037,447776,5,nicolabushell,01/04/2019,Although behind a petrol station it's one of the best park ups we've been to! It feels like you're in the middle of the desert. be sure to park with your windows facing the beautiful views! enjoy!
79037,441393,4,caruli,18/03/2019,"We slept one night without problems, we were completely alone. Close to the road but little noise. Nice to spend a night, there is no restriction."

79037,413611,5,hymy14,11/12/2018,"Great place, looking for peace. WC are open during the opening hours of the Repsol gas station. About 1km from Mini Hollywood, which is now open Saturday, Sunday and holidays. Admission € 22.50. From the pitch, a trail leads through a dried-up river, a gigantic nature experience. Top only to be recommended."
79037,412335,5,susins06,06/12/2018,Good place and quiet to sleep. flat. and with a starry sky. beautiful sunrise.

79037,407848,3,D0m1n1c,16/11/2018,"Not a bad place to stop - the Repsol has water (tap with screw thread) and no one objected to us only filling up with water and not buying fuel. Nowhere to empty the black and grey water. Although the motorway is nearby, the road noise isn't an issue. Great view of the hills."

79040,3022927,4,anita3012,26/07/2023,A very quiet place to go with the van (we have been alone at the end of July). There is a sign where camping and caravans (not motorhomes) are prohibited. With toilet that open in the morning.

79040,1714960,4,Freerules,24/12/2021,Beautiful and quiet place but it is not clear whether or not it is forbidden to spend the night. In low season I don't think there will be problems.
79040,1314556,3,patxus,11/07/2021,Quiet place to spend a few days. The village bar is closed. Although there is a sign forbidden dogs and here they do not say anything. Little crowded at the moment. With a toilet and no place to dump the garbage.

79040,1115579,4,pedrolb76,15/11/2020,Extraordinary place to rest next to the Nagore Reservoir. We have spent one night next to another Ac and without problems. In high season or summer I do not know if it will be well seen. It says that camping and caravans are prohibited. Circular walk next to the reservoir of 6kms ideal for children. There are no bins. Parking in good condition and level.
79040,711816,3,joelle91,03/10/2019,"Very large new asphalt parking, far from the roads. No problem at night The other stop not far from this one is no longer accessible or we did not find the right road access."

79040,378748,1,Quentin-Lelievre,21/09/2018,"The note of 1 star is just to indicate that the zone being in works during our passage, impossible to reach the site. Nevertheless we slept upstream in a parcel adjoining an old building in ruins. very calm, flat and shaded by the river."

79061,808819,3,rimorico,25/05/2020,Nice place to keep. It is a natural park and you cannot stay overnight (prohibited from sunrise). However it is worth the effort to go soon. In high season very restrictive guards and many people.
79061,780076,4,chickpea,14/02/2020,"Beautiful place to park. Ok to overnight in off season. Civil guard pass regularly. There are many cyclists, joggers and dog walkers using the path during the day but at night only the sound of the waves. Short walk to the bars and shops in the town. Market on Saturday."
79061,744171,1,Terry319,17/11/2019,Day only parking signs prohibit no overnight parking allowed

79061,479672,5,Sunshinne,09/05/2019,"Beautiful place, thank you! I stayed here one night and no problems. I arrived at dusk and left early in the morning. The Civil Guard went twice and did not say anything to me. Maybe in high season it's a problem."
79061,293551,1,Pennythevan,19/07/2018,There is a sign that prohibit campers.
79069,2188205,1,RobertLara,07/08/2022,"Road closed by a fence, where it is indicated that the passage of motor vehicles is prohibited"
79069,1783251,5,couka1,14/03/2022,several locations before the hermitage. Very quiet and clean. Perfect. A lot of walking paths and hermitage to visit with its small bar...
79072,3173358,1,elclemen,18/08/2023,"The civil guard picked up two vans at 9 in the morning. They told us that ""camping"" is prohibited throughout Aragon and that we will receive a notification with the regulations. We do not know if with sanction or not"
79072,2973470,2,papymitch,16/07/2023,A crazy world this Sunday! we flee! places lower but accessible 4x4. the basins are all full of people!
79072,2954587,5,Morgancanyis,12/07/2023,A good place to spend a relaxed day bathing in some very nice gurgs.
79072,2859961,4,jovio,16/06/2023,"Very good for sleeping one night and river down the road, first car park by the road second below, for the rest the road is more than complicated, too bad because at the bottom great car park by the river"
79072,2836793,5,lorie44,09/06/2023,"Alone at the water's edge, in a quiet location and sheltered from the wind. We were able to swim."
79072,2728440,4,AnjaRenault,06/05/2023,"Great place for many vans. We stayed here for 2 nights one alone and one with another van. A lot of locals are passing buy to swim in the river, but at night there are no noises but the sound of the river. I defenetely recommend it just be careful with the road, we had no problems with renault senic (my boyfriend is an excelent driver;))."
79072,2708793,5,camama13,30/04/2023,"Great place close to the river. There are several places to park we stayed at the top because there is a passage too complicated to pass with a big van (big holes in the way). Lots of vans went down to river level, we were alone in the parking lot higher up."
79072,2640002,5,labrava,04/04/2023,"Super quiet, there is garbage, you can cook without problem and take a bath."
79072,2473544,5,theflipside,31/10/2022,Beautiful spot by the river in a canyon. Water is running now. The road is not too bad in my opinion. Check it by foot before driving down though.
79072,2399884,2,mpradere,24/09/2022,"very nice place unfortunately the water is very low, brown and very stagnant. we left immediately! we hoped to be able to swim, it's missed!"
79072,2355473,4,joanmar,09/09/2022,"I only went down to take a bath, the nice place for the bathroom, the last section of descent, is very bad, better to leave the van, where the descent begins."
79072,2337234,4,thevivavan,04/09/2022,"Good place to spend the night. We did not go all the way down, since the road is rough, and the views were better from the top than from the bottom. Walking is 3 min. There are 5 places to park from the beginning of the road, where the rubbish is. We parked in the second."
79072,2299796,4,JonahPineapple,25/08/2022,"good place to spend the day with pools to bathe! The drawback is that if you go into the forest there is a bit of garbage, of uncivilized people! Good esplanade, BE CAREFUL when going down the road, several large potholes. We went down with the Camper without problems to the river! Possible to spend the night, with the noise of the water"
79072,2269770,3,Furnece,19/08/2022,"If you want to spend one night it's fine, but no more. We have a dog and the dust that remains on her legs is horrible. It also gave the feeling that it smelled like pee and poop (a lot of paper and wipes around). If you go down to the bottom, the weather resists, as it rains you don't go out."
79072,2228300,5,Nanoroadtrip,13/08/2022,"Perfect for one or more quiet nights, near the river below the cliffs! Indeed, the track to descend to the lowest level is quite strenuous but is done all the same (van 6 meters)! Places for several vehicles and calm from 8 p.m. once the locals leave the river!"
79072,2221373,5,LesBonheursDeSophie,12/08/2022,"Just great, access a little chaotic, but very doable in a van without the need for a 4*4. probably very busy during the day, but no one in the evening, swimming and absolute calm in a magical setting, we spent the night there without any worries!"
79072,2120429,4,naleks66,25/07/2022,"Great spot with a slightly steep path and pebble/sand coating but doable with a van (possibility to park higher at different levels if necessary). Unfortunately for a visit on a Saturday during the day and in summer, we had to give up and leave because too many people and no places available at the bottom...we will just have to test the way with the van :-)"
79072,2115276,5,JK17,24/07/2022,really great place. 10km/h to go down max because very rocky and crevasses. careful underbody. absolute calm. the river is very cute. alone in the world. no passage after 9 p.m. a small box. do not hesitate!
79072,2113863,4,Pablotayson,24/07/2022,We were on the road and we stopped because it was close to the highway. You have to enter carefully through the gaps in the path but you enter well. Quiet place with a stream of crystal clear waters in which we bathe in the afternoon and in the morning.
79072,2079767,5,paradeiser,16/07/2022,"Very nice, level and quiet place. Decent to the lower parking was no problem with a VW Bus (slowly and carefully). Beautiful scenery to take a bath in the river."
79072,2054455,4,vagamundodo,09/07/2022,"Lots of places, watch out for the bottom of the body during the descent. Well worth it, river with very warm water, preferably go under the cliff, the setting is idyllic. I did not sleep there but spent some time during the day."
79072,2053823,5,MyleneJerome,09/07/2022,"Great spot, swimming nearby. However very chaotic path"
79072,2012825,5,finallyontheroadagain,26/06/2022,"Really good place to sleep and swim, beautiful clear clean water makes the drive down to the lower parking places worth it. Highly recommended."
79072,1999611,4,conanthebest,22/06/2022,great spot to spend a night. I bit dusty but this is Spain. the river is beautiful and perfect for a morning swim
79072,1875859,4,ninario,07/05/2022,"The positives: the view is magnificent, and isolated but close to the road, very quiet. The negatives: the ground is not straight and there is human excrement. We weren't bothered by Guardia Civil as outside of the natural park I think. We stayed on the upper part to get as much sun as possible, but the lower part has direct access to the very pleasant but busier pleasant river."
79072,1856074,5,can-am,27/04/2022,"A corner away. Frequented during the day, in summer by locals. Possibility to park before the descent. No service, the river next door"
79072,1854917,5,projet.moksha,26/04/2022,"Spot at the top, nice view, at the water's edge."
79072,1766362,4,NansJaffeux,26/02/2022,"the spot is quite good, close to the river and nice view onto the cliff on the opposite riverside.
picked up a lot a trash but impossible to hear the road and nobody came:February
the access via the dirt road is slightly difficult because there is concrete water evacuation that are quite deep but you don't need a 4x4 by good weather, just be aware of your van clearance, not recommend for big RV"
79072,1758814,5,doomplanet,18/02/2022,"nice location, carefully steer around a pothole. we were halfway on a plateau, all the way to the river is a bit too daring."
79072,1650141,3,solal91,17/10/2021,Spot that seems nice but we turned around before entering it. The road is to this day in too bad condition to go down and up again with a motorhome. Rather recommended for van / light vehicle.
79072,1375686,1,Moisestrota,28/07/2021,"Currently the access road is in poor condition, we turned around to see how a sandy slope was bumpy"
79072,1330835,3,losethenorth,16/07/2021,The place is very beautiful but today (07/16/2021) there is a generator running all night !!
79072,1309528,5,teref7,09/07/2021,"It is an easy place to find. You can go down with the car almost to the river where you can bathe din problem. There is a beautiful space with stones to relax and sunbathe. The esplanade for the vehicle is flat and comfortable to spend the night. There are trees, but not much shade."
79072,1277688,5,zoearg,26/06/2021,"Convenient spot facing the river, very quiet, flat. No services."
79072,843142,3,Monina,30/06/2020,It's a beautiful place. We really appreciated bathing in the river after hours of driving in the heat. A pity that it is full of garbage ... We did not dare to go down to the bottom with our motorhome. The road is very worn and poorly maintained.
79072,782471,4,TheTurtleFamily,18/02/2020,"Very good, quiet, but very worn path with large hole. For my part I did not go down to the bottom because too difficult with my motorhome."
79072,680198,4,IvanIvan,07/09/2019,We have been twice at the end of this summer. There is possibility to take places with shade. Once you reach the river area you can choose to park right there or move about 100 m along another dirt road. I do not put five stars because the access is a tricky trick but with our 7.5 m motorhome we have been able to go down and climb quite well.In case of risk of rain or that it has already rained and the ground is wet yes I do not recommend going down until the end and it is better to stay in an alternative parking 100 m up
79072,638469,5,mappy,17/08/2019,"Perfect place for a break of a day or two Do not hesitate to go down at the end of the path, pretty well shaded place"
79072,606561,5,getbusgo,07/08/2019,"We parked at the top rather than going down the heavily rutted path, but it may be possible with caution. The stream down below is perfection!"
79072,584526,3,Liment,29/07/2019,"Beautiful place, unfortunately waste, in large quantities, litter the ground. We still enjoyed swimming and taking a drink."
79072,580523,4,Dg2m,28/07/2019,Nice spot; a little dusty; very calm ; only for the night after the departure of the families who come to bathe the day; a small swim when you wake up without anyone and with the singing of birds .. a treat!
79072,555665,5,Dauba,15/07/2019,"Great place. It's a bit hot to go down and up but it's worth the trip. Beautiful, river, jump a little above the dam."
79072,536417,5,Mistercervino,02/07/2019,"I spent one Saturday night at the beginning of July completely alone. It is true that the road to the river has some bumps, but I with my minicamper without problems. Very recommendable site, it is a joy to stick a newly raised bath to activate. To put a hit at night there were mosquitoes and the next morning around ten o'clock began the procession of people to bathe."
79072,498722,5,vitoreisen,31/05/2019,"No engine noise, only birds - wonderful!"
79072,424950,5,FionaCAP,27/01/2019,"Great place to spend the night and spend a day. We do not go down to the Del Rio esplanade because the road is rutted, we stayed in an esplanade about 200 m from the river. Equally recommended"
79072,407129,5,dailyvanlife,13/11/2018,"Really nice spot next to a river stream, flat surface for parking and very quiet and peaceful. The road down is in a bad shape but we had no problem getting down here as it is really short path. People with low vans or campers could have some problems. Definitely recommended!"
79072,354164,4,courgette,26/08/2018,Ideal for a night away. With massaging bath in small stream. Flat and shaded parking for the night.
79072,331361,3,combi12,13/08/2018,Good to swim! Path not too driveable.
79116,1527300,5,mariap,29/08/2021,"A very beautiful and very quiet place next to the river with a bathing area, mountain routes with a very beautiful landscape to enjoy"
79136,3097603,4,pb14,07/08/2023,Ideal for parking during the day. Bus stop 300 meters away to reach the city center in 10 minutes Bus ticket €1.85.
79136,2428768,1,JPIERRE49360,07/10/2022,"Just for vans, and there still needs to be room."
79136,1886710,1,gil84,13/05/2022,Not at all suitable for motorhomes we found in the street which goes up to the side of the road
79136,792238,4,paultrademark,07/03/2020,"Just arrived 3pm on a Saturday and car park near full. one place I had to reverse in so overhang grass. But avoid if football on. 
Will update later if I stay the night here. 

Update
Managed to move to a better bay, peaceful night considering the location.
safe enough as well lit and people around.
Bus into town numbers 13/14 takes 15mins and is €1.80"
79136,775561,4,madrock9a,02/02/2020,"Ideal for parking, other places are possible in the rise of the stadium. Bus 300m to reach the city center in 10-15min. Bus ticket 1.8 € ... We left the van there for 2 days without any problem. Probably a bit noisy at night."
79136,587939,3,renaud3636,31/07/2019,We stayed for the night because we came back too late and not in a condition to get back on the road ^^ not a lot of traffic but that does not prevent us from sleeping peacefully.
79136,526158,4,UkSkippy,23/06/2019,"Good place for day parking, free spaces and seemed safe in comparison to other views, probably a 30 minute walk into town but nice all the same, I wouldn’t stay the night, in fact I wouldn’t stay in SAN Sebastian for a night as to many ugly reviews of burglary.  Great for day trip and stay out of town where it is safer for a night."
79136,319927,3,sastrejepossl,07/08/2018,Good plan to go to town by bike. on the other hand on foot it is far. not a spot to sleep: traffic and no view
79184,3272161,4,AlberNati,08/09/2023,Place to spend a few days. Town next door. Nice people. Emptying and filling.
79184,3067094,5,AnaEsther,03/08/2023,"It is what I like: a place to stop, appreciate something different (the natural pool), go to spend the night in the tranquility of silence, get up and see a beautiful landscape. It has no light, no showers, it's just a place to stop and below the drain and water service, but I don't leave the house to plug into the current but to catch this other current that delights the senses."
79184,3016672,5,Polilla67,25/07/2023,"Nice area between big trees. Chiringuito in a natural pool, good prices and magnificent views. Thank the town hall for this area, an example for other towns in the Sierra de Gata."
79184,2944758,4,Annikaschnitzler,10/07/2023,"Spent one night here. Except for a few barking dogs and a couple of cars that sped by during the night, it's a quiet spot here. I slept well for a change and felt safe. Recommended for a night in transit! V/E was not needed by us."
79184,2922697,5,PakitoCalvo,04/07/2023,"Very good motorhome area with complete services and a shaded area with picnic areas 50m away, and a magnificent landscape with fresh air. Very close is the natural pool walking down the road 500m and has ""Los Molinos"" with a beach bar. Thanks to the Ayuntamiento for maintaining this site."
79184,2843007,5,Halakran,11/06/2023,"Very quiet place with tables, next to a road with little traffic. They came from the town hall to welcome us and on the last day they brought gifts for the children. María Jesús was a charm, we will go back for sure. Nearby is the natural pool with a beach bar that eats well and the menu is 15 euros."
79184,2774010,5,RainerWuertz,21/05/2023,"Actually, everything is already written - super nice parking space with a great view and functioning disposal point. Area not affected by the current forest fires in the region! And then of course Maria Jesus came by (Sunday evening) and asked if everything was okay and if I had any questions or needed anything. I'm speechless about this great service. THANKS!!"
79184,2760233,4,deanandvic,18/05/2023,"What a surprise this stop turned out to be! Maria is such a beautiful generous person ready to help with anything you may need.

79184,2744991,5,alvastur,13/05/2023,"IMPRESSIVE with capital letters the good reception by María Jesús de Turismo, always attentive so that you are comfortable and you do not lack anything, her recommendations are all very successful and the environment of the place is essential to know its towns and places. Special mention to Robledillo de Gata with its museum and oil products, as well as the tour of its beautiful streets"
79184,2716274,5,Jogaba,02/05/2023,"Spectacular, María Jesús de Turismo is super attentive, informs you of everything in a close and original way, very comfortable, we will repeat and recommend 100%. Thank you for loving us in your region"

79184,2681718,4,margaya,19/04/2023,Thanks to the people for the area and sympathy of the neighbors. María Jesús honors the patron saint of the town.
79184,2656033,5,levichi,09/04/2023,"Motorhome area in the village with excellent views. It hurts that the mountain in front burned in summer. However, we were received by Maria Jesus who was a charm. I prepare a delicious orange salad for all the caravanists who want, and I inform us of everything that has been and will be. We had a great time. The site highly recommended, good access and all services."
79184,2651957,5,jimymax,08/04/2023,"Good place to spend the night, let's take care of it and it will last, thanks to the town hall, we bought a wonderful oil."

79184,2636901,5,Pacomovil,03/04/2023,"Very quiet overnight area. With beautiful views. Very pretty town with several routes for hiking or biking. Very friendly people. The reception given to us by Maria Jesús, from the tourist office, was spectacular. She saw us arrive and approached the area with her car to receive us, give us a map of the area and advise us on routes and places of interest. Thank the city council for this initiative."
79184,2630257,5,MonisFamily,30/03/2023,"Ideal place to spend the night if you do not need services, next to the town on foot. BE CAREFUL because in the town you cannot enter with the AC. I give it a 5 for María Jesús, the tourist girl who goes to receive you in the morning, prepares a guided tour for you, explains everything wonderfully and also gave us oil and a backpack for my daughter. THE VIEWS ARE BEAUTIFUL and the environment, idyllic, I would repeat without a doubt"
79184,2622604,5,goodcompany2together,24/03/2023,"love this place,the Sierra  de Gata.Nature at its best! and cycling. this area has so much to offer.. you will meet Maria, tourist guide of area, will make a point of finding you, to ensure you have a pleasant stay. stayed twice in last 7 weeks. great service area regularly checked.  Respect this area. picnic benches in parking area above service area. thanks Maria. see you soon."
79184,2607262,4,flymo,12/03/2023,"Nice spot with great views and surrounded by hills and trees. The pitches are just parking spots between trees, no services, not flat and tree roots. I struggled to get anywhere near flat in the van without levellers."
79184,2607158,4,fermy,12/03/2023,"The area is very well located with good views and good people, the town is beautiful, it is worth visiting."

(30 euro beer and food for 4) We went mountain biking from here and had a great day exploring. Water and waste disposal is only 50m from parking area.

79184,2510010,4,khorne,01/12/2022,"We tried to stay but the places were too muddy and slippery.  It is probably a great place when dry.   The main access road to this place is not in TomTom and so the satnav took us through some streets until we could get no further.   We have a tiny van, a motorhome would get very stuck.   There is an easy access road which is on Google maps, the problem is just with TomTom."
79184,2475827,5,BHOKTR,01/11/2022,"Very well maintained overnight area, among trees and with wooden tables. It has an area to evacuate water. Good choice to see the Sierra de Gata."
79184,2437420,5,Kiro2022,11/10/2022,"A jewel among pitches. Free of charge, no electricity, but a very kind and nice tourism officer named Maria Jesus, who greeted us upon arrival and even brought us a bottle of wine: It was Sunday and we were stranded. Many thanks for this hospitality."
79184,2431896,5,Dersu2001,08/10/2022,"An area in perfect condition, next to the town, quiet, the loading and unloading area very well. And with the bonus of the person in charge of the tourist office, María Jesús, five stars for her."
79184,2418172,4,dongala,02/10/2022,"We have been surprised by this coquettish and beautiful town. In the morning María Jesús, from tourism, appeared, a charming person who has informed us very well about the places to visit throughout the area. I wish the other towns would imitate her, because she does a great job to promote tourism. Thanks to the town of Torres de Don Miguel for this motorhome area."
79184,2417345,2,CasitaNL,02/10/2022,"The cars rush past your bumper, dogs barking by the dozen, night was pretty quiet. Service place great!"
79184,2370484,5,ketxa,14/09/2022,We were in December. A very comfortable area in a charming town. María Jesús gives you all the information you need. Many routes nearby. In the bar in the square they prepare some really good chapatas!!
79184,2342834,5,10Gorka,05/09/2022,"Area of 10. The emptying and filling area in perfect condition. The person in charge of the María Jesús interpretation center welcomes you, providing you with information, advice and help. The area is close to the natural pool. The town has shops, pharmacy and bars in the square. A whole experience walking through its streets both day and night. We will repeat!"
79184,2241340,5,Aitoretxa,15/08/2022,"The area is charming. The natural pool is very beautiful and you can eat great in the beach bar. The townspeople are very open. Yesterday there was ""cockading"", where we participated and it was a lot of fun. María Jesús, the tourism technique is worth its weight in gold. An essential stop in Sierra de Gata."
79184,2202492,5,Txavito,09/08/2022,"everything was correct, María Jesús was a charm, she came to see us at night and with a laser pointer in hand she explained the constellations to us, my son freaked out a lot. Well tower of don Miguel with this area. soon they will open another in Cadalso, they say"

The barking of the dogs is constant during the night... it makes sleep quite impossible and we sleep with noise without a problem. Still, we'll be back :)"
79184,1893991,4,LnaLna,16/05/2022,The site is fine. good views. almost flat water services. but the dogs... what a war at night. impossible to sleep
79184,1890503,4,Ulysse06,14/05/2022,Perfect as described by those who have used this step. Congratulations and thank you to Maria for her kindness and her availability!!! One thing to improve which is important: try to reduce the barking of a troop of dogs (breeding or guarding nearby?) which has not stopped all night! Too bad… Difficult to sleep in these conditions.

Thank you very much for being like this Maria Jesus."

The town, very good, the natural pool, although closed, now has the route of the mills, which is very good. signs of the area and DO NOT pay attention to the GPS, leave the road and a ramp, long and steep, takes you directly to the area. Very level central sites, the sides, less."
79184,1832446,5,Maripa53,17/04/2022,great area. The reception by MJesus phenomenal. We did a couple of walking routes that she recommended very cool. The sausages and cheeses from the village butcher shop are exquisite. We will return without a doubt.

79184,1740658,5,kibosindylola,24/01/2022,"Great everything. It is not the best known town in Gata (since it is not a historical complex) but in my opinion it is well worth a walk through its center and its Jewish and Arab quarters. In addition, the town tries to attract motorhomes and if the Area is full, María Jesús takes care of finding another place for them to stay in town without problems. Obviously it is Gata, so for hikers and mountain bikers it is a paradise"

We decided to stay the night when María Jesús appeared like a rattle of energy to give us some chocolates, offer her sincere help to bring us shopping and tell us the location of the health center in case we get worse. THANK YOU."

79200,2990616,3,oliverannuss,20/07/2023,Sweet little place and small nice campsite. The nearby waterfalls are beautiful! Reception very nice! Unfortunately there is a church here that feels like having to ring the bell every half hour from 7 a.m. ?!?j There's nothing like sleeping in and relaxing.

79200,1847810,5,LennartFloete,23/04/2022,We didn't want to drive far after the waterfall and found the burst by accident. We were greeted very warmly. The price was fully justified. The toilets were very modern and clean. We really enjoyed the visit and can recommend it.
79200,1844476,5,FerdiVan21,21/04/2022,Small but fine! The sanitary facilities are super clean and hot showers. A lovingly run campsite and the owners staff very nice and helpful.

The drive through the national park is phenomenal and the town of Ermida is beautiful (although I did not find a restaurant, supermarket or similar, but there are a few things on the CP).

79200,1602211,5,Tionelim,23/09/2021,"Perfect for a quiet campsite in the middle of a small village and perfectly clean. Helpful welcome. Beautiful walks around. Please note: - easy access by car / campsite from / to the waterfalls of ""Fecha de Barjas"" and from / to the town of Pereiro BUT not the other small roads - for light sleepers, the bell tower rings around 7 a.m. and is silent after approximately 11 p.m."

A good starting point for hikes or just to relax. We felt really good! We are traveling with a Bulli, the road to Ermida is easy to drive with it and the longer way was absolutely worth it."
79200,1537846,5,Waeggerli,01/09/2021,"Great little CamlingJose at the reception is very friendly and also gives hiking tips. Great starting point for hikes. It is not possible to cross narrow, winding access roads everywhere"

79200,1462389,4,Cebey,15/08/2021,"Nice and very well stocked campsite. Clean bathrooms, modern showers with hot water, comfortable pitches. Friendly staff. The only drawback is that, at least at this time, they do not allow to reserve pitches for campers and AC, they are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis."
79200,1439034,3,MalouArends,11/08/2021,"Basic camping with a nice atmosphere. At the time we were there, the main road CM1276 was blocked, so the owner Carlos told us to take an alternative road, approximately 3 km after the village of Geres. DONT DO IT!! For small campervans it might be okay, but for us (6 meter campervan) it was horrible. Way too thight and lot of traffic. We almost got stuck halfway. A true nightmare."
79200,1418077,5,Safiou,07/08/2021,"Small family campsite with super friendly, helpful, personable staff. from the first moment you feel welcome.

79200,1409801,1,durendal1936,05/08/2021,Great place to stay but a HORRIBLE road getting here. Impossible for campervans more than 6m as there is currently a deviation route that you need to take. This is really a small mountain road with a lot of traffic. Almost not feasible for a motorhome. DO NOT GO HERE.
79200,1382368,5,GRPL,30/07/2021,Just terrific. Nice little place. You cannot reserve in advance at 3:30 p.m. we still had a large choice of seats. Small but great campsite. We are here two nights.

Very friendly welcome and very attentive staff to the comfort of the occupants of the campsite (why the campsite closes at 11pm) We stayed there for 2 days to visit the area a bit.

There are little things in the bistro, the Nahe mini market offers bread rolls and the essentials."
79200,1248212,5,ninafa,11/06/2021,"Definitely recommendable! Small and nice. The sanitary facilities were very clean and there was even a changing unit in the men's room. Super cool !! Most of the time motorbike travelers spend the night in the small huts, and they still drive their machines across the square until very late at night. Perfect starting point to hike to the waterfalls (approx. 10km there and back, medium difficulty). There are pools along the course of the river where you can swim. Very nice!"
79200,1232589,5,jonas_jfp,02/06/2021,"Highly recommended! Cozy little campsite. The owner is friendly and gave tips on hiking routes. Small cafe / bistro with affordable prices.

The plumbing was very clean and was cleaned two to three times a day. In addition, also relatively new. According to the operator, there is also a spout for chemical toilets. We did not have to use it. The Weitern can also be hiked from here several waterfalls, some on really beautiful trails. Quiet at night (depending on the visitor). We would definitely come again."

79236,3043110,1,Mandalorian,30/07/2023,Wrong. To spend one night and that's it. The routes in the area are full of huge mastiff dogs that are on the loose. Without shadow.

I spent 2 nights, one day I went on a route and the van stayed there, and another day I took it up to the Lomos de Orio hermitage, which has very beautiful routes. Everything shop next door. Brilliant."
79236,2864383,4,airam23,17/06/2023,"Ideal for spending the night and hiking in the mountains. With the picnic tables and the fountain, great to eat and if not, you have two places in town that do the trick."
79236,2651435,4,jotaeme218,08/04/2023,"We stayed a couple of nights. The site is perfect to have as a reference when preparing your routes through the mountains. From the interpretation center they confirmed that we could sleep. Next door is an account and containers, and a store in case you were missing something. We were at Easter and you could park without problems."
79236,2605350,3,Burgaillo,11/03/2023,"Interesting car park that could well be converted into an area. There are very sloping squares.

79236,1798756,4,Bituko,28/03/2022,"We spent Saturday night in total peace. Obviously it is just a parking lot, without services. Even so, next to it there is a fountain, a table for lunch and a little shop. The sound of the river and sporadically that of the cowbells give it an added charm, they are mountain villages for a reason. Perfect starting point for the Puente Ra waterfalls trail, highly recommended now in spring."
79236,1778236,1,philou47,09/03/2022,"Impossible to sleep before 11:30 p.m. that night. In question the many dogs wandering in the village and barking constantly. The Mojon Alto hike is not at all pleasant, because the paths are largely rutted by cows. As for the cleanliness of the site, there is enormous potential for improvement, there is a lot of waste and paper everywhere. We won't be back."

Very lively and beautiful place. A big beach and plenty to see or do. Wanted to stay longer.

There is LOTS of parking space. It does get very crowded in weekends. During the week there's a nice amount of people.

There are dressing rooms, toilets and outside showers (cold).

San Andres is a small village at a 5m walk from the parking."
79255,1124146,5,Oskar2001,26/12/2020,Hello Rustiba. Are you still on the island? What about the journey (Corona)? We start our journey by bus to Tenerife on December 30th? What is to be considered?
79255,1122919,5,Rustiba,21/12/2020,"I came from the ferry from Huelva at 3 o'clock in the morning and had entered this nearby and easily accessible place into my GPS in advance.

79255,476809,4,rdunky,05/05/2019,Very nice place. A bit noisy during the day but calm at night. In the morning the tractor goes raking the beach early enough. Located 25 minutes by bike from Santa Cruz.
79255,457263,3,alfvde,17/04/2019,"We didn’t see a sign that this is an ‘official’ motorhome parking spot, so just parked on the big beach parking, next to some other motorhomes. Nice beach with everything, pretty little village. Noisy at night because of the street nearby. We were there in the weekend and the beach was of course PACKED. Good spot to park outside the city before the ferry in Santa Cruz (+- 15 min. drive to the port)."
79255,420831,5,photonomaden,06/01/2019,"Really recommended! Great location, closer to the beach is really not and in addition for free. A dream! The sand is wonderfully fine, there are also shadows from palm trees and other trees. Beach showers, toilets, snack bars, everything there. The best places for motorhomes in the first row are limited (about 7) further back on the Parkplatugelände there is another area for campers."

Little truck passing from 7 am to pick up furniture thrown at the clean point, which is also in the parking lot and whistling, very nice people. And a whiff of garbage that invites you to keep the AC closed in August."
79279,1641904,5,MartaMartitaMartasa,12/10/2021,Large parking lot. Quiet. On horseback between Seville and Huelva. You detour exactly 3 minutes from the highway. Small town and very friendly inhabitants. Very good option.

We arrived around 8 p.m. and the site was almost full (5 vans) so we preferred to go a little further on the path. Lots of noise all night and in the morning whether it's walkers or other vehicles trying to park. Maybe it's better out of season.

79284,3117618,4,tentinette,10/08/2023,"Well, parking authorized without problem. On the other hand do not expect to be alone, there is a lot of passage. It is better to come before 6 p.m. in August to be sure of having a small place. Quite noisy although little traffic as many hoped to settle. Walk down to Passaia very nice!"

79284,2924929,3,weinsberg679,05/07/2023,This is a pleasant place for an overnight stay. It's just a pity that some users leave a mess there. A nice walk can be made over the path to a stony beach with a nice seat. That is also the end of the walk through the old part of Pasai.
79284,2882376,5,kaicinski,22/06/2023,"Very nice and quiet place. Many hikes possible. But there were quite a few campers/womos there. If you are considerate of each other and keep the place clean, hopefully it will be preserved for a long time."

Space for 8 motorhomes, if there are no cars. next to a river There is shade. Go down 100m. to metro or bus no. 13 to the Blvd. The center of San Sebastian. To return, take the same bus at the same stop. THE MOTORHOME AREA is usually full. This is a very valid alternative."
79284,2702131,5,ninafu,27/04/2023,Super nice place for one night. I felt safe and comfortable. If you go along the path you come down to the sea about 1 hour you need for there and back.

79284,2515194,4,ChevyPickup,07/12/2022,"What hasn’t been mentioned is how steep the roads are to get up here. It’s 100s of metres up very steep and 180deg switchbacks and a few narrow lanes next to the rock face. I really struggled with a 3.5 ton old van (longer than 7m - could be harder too) If your van is underpowered, (lack of turbo and heavy) may be tough. But a peaceful place at night. Only occasional boy racer (before 11pm)."
79284,2461183,4,saucissenomade,25/10/2022,"Great spot to sleep for a night. Try to get there early because there is not so much place 2/3 vans. Once there, you have a really beautiful hike just nearby."
79284,2456701,4,barneywrobel,22/10/2022,"Perfect if you’re looking for a quiet, picturesque, out of town place to crash. No facilities, but beautiful walks and paths around the hills & forests."

The next morning we were woken up by a ranger/park ranger and semi-politely asked to move the car off the trail, which we found easy on the parked on the gravel path (you couldn't see it at night). Bikers, workers came by in the morning, everyone friendly, no one seems to mind the campers."

79284,2201416,3,rociorg79,09/08/2022,"Beautiful place to camp. The only thing is that it is such a well-known place that when we arrived there were many people and in the morning the council guards came to make us leave. At least we weren't fined. If you go with a tent I don't recommend it, but with a van or motorhome, because they didn't have any problems and they could continue sleeping."

79284,2095336,5,JohnKurkuma,19/07/2022,Very nice spot to stay overnight. In itself very quiet but there are many campers there during the season. There is a footpath to a beautiful bay.

79284,2076626,4,anspaeps,15/07/2022,Nice basic spot for a night. Take the path down through the forest down to the port. A nice walk rewarded by an outdoor (ice cold) shower at the end

79284,1768366,1,kinenomad,27/02/2022,"Personally, it's not very pretty... 3 or 4 vans fit next to each other with hardly any space. In my opinion there are much better places to stay."
79284,1758633,5,Haasepko,17/02/2022,"Great place to spend the night. There is enough space for 3-4 Vans and you get a wonderful view over San Sebastian. A great sunset is included, too, if you‘re lucky! 5/5 would sleep again. Beware though: the road there is quite steep, so you might want to give your a little motivational talk, put in the second gear and go on slow and steady! (I did it with a 30 year old van, so you can, too!)"

79284,1423308,3,GertvanHaitsma,08/08/2021,Nice place for 1 night. Quiet and edge of nature with walks. A lot of ground is not flat. Ideal place after a day in San Sebastian. Excellent environment to make (climbing) kilometers with the racing bike.

We wanted to spend a night here, but shortly before us a group of chaos left, who distributed their excrement right next to the parking space and left rubbish everywhere.

79284,1183521,5,PerlaBeltza,02/05/2021,"We had a wonderful night. From the car park, a path goes down to the beach of San Juan. This ""beach"" is made of rocks and boulders. From here you can see the entrance to the entrance to the port of Pasajes. Opposite, at the top, the stately ""Faro de la Plata"" of Pasajes San Pedro. Once at the ""beach"" if we continue to the left we will arrive by a path bordering the bay to the town of San Juan."

79284,1064747,2,davidch,22/09/2020,We arrived in the evening and there was no one there. We didn’t hesitate about the space but the truth is we didn’t feel safe staying there. All very dark and away from the city.

79284,409308,5,LukeG,22/11/2018,Had a great stay here.  Were woken by hunters however they were friendly. Must drive up the main road and then along the smaller track from the east. Don’t come from the west as it was a very very steep section that was a bit frightening.
79284,395921,5,JennyRoze,19/10/2018,Very little location at this place. The motorhome 7.5 meters passes but it must be early. The night was calm. Many walkers in the morning. A nice view below on Pasaia. A good moment

Today there are several motorhomes."
79294,2481535,3,AnaOrtega,04/11/2022,Quiet place ... a walk from the town center but by road ... There is almost no water pressure and there is only one tap. We slept alone but very comfortable.
79294,2068153,5,Roismofer,13/07/2022,Quiet and big place. No problem for Camper or large AC. Bar and shops nearby
79294,1920087,1,Giull,27/05/2022,"Apparently you can NOT park here anymore, it is a place they use to set up the town fair and market. Instead they have put an area at the entrance of the town, but we left because it smells very bad"
79294,1758342,4,robfp,17/02/2022,Great place for a stop over but please don’t treat it as a campsite and put awnings out etc or I have been told you will be asked to move on.

79294,1752500,1,Flipper2,10/02/2022,"...should wait there in the dark. I waited outside for a few minutes and still considered whether I should speak to him. However, since my Spanish is not very good and the situation seemed very strange to me, we drove on. Sleep would have been out of the question. There's probably a logical explanation for this and it was a stupid coincidence, but it was too weird for the 2/2 of us"
79294,1752491,1,Flipper_Mobil,10/02/2022,"Arrived in the afternoon and everything seemed fine. That night I was going out to lock up the bikes when I noticed something moving in the field in front of me... It seemed to be a man then moving towards a tree, there he was waiting and we were probably looking at each other. Since it was really cold I couldn't explain why anyone.. (1/2)"
79294,1746249,5,SaoirseTheRelayCamper,02/02/2022,"Amazing spot in the middle of the town. Great spot for the start of the walk ""Senda del Amor"" which is a stunning 6.1km walk around the town and up to the viewpoint. No services but a quiet night was had. The parking is totally flat. We felt very safe that we left the van here to go explore the town. Thank you Ugíjar!"
79294,1134601,4,LauraV123,02/02/2021,"Nothing fancy but incredibly peaceful, flat and safe. We arrived in the middle of the night to shield from the wind we were facing at another spot and parked next to the building which did the job! We stayed for an extra night. A few dog walkers but they don’t bother you. & we heard no dogs barking at any point across our stay. There is also FREE WATER at the BP garage - recommended."
79294,837930,3,molly95,27/06/2020,Nice and level but dogs barking till the early hours
79294,779098,2,SonjaundWolli,11/02/2020,"Well-located clay floor space. Lots of dogs barking, even at night."

79294,771933,5,robfp,24/01/2020,"Looked at the Aire at the bottom of the village and didn’t like it seemed more a compound. So stay here, had a nice meal out and a quiet nights sleep. Recommended."
79294,750610,4,LuNoWik,06/12/2019,"I liked it. I parked right behind the building, hiding for wind. The village has some small shops (nothing special) and a handful of tapas bars, where staff is really nice (1 beer, 1 wine, 3 tapas = 5.4€). Dog friendly, too. There is water fountain hidden behind a tree when walking into the village from the parking."

79294,408586,5,cagire,18/11/2018,"It is a huge dirt field. We had a day and a night without problems. It is very central, there are nice shops. We bought clothes and eaten at the bar and restaurant. I do not understand why the official area is at the bottom of the village, very far from the center, which does not make it possible to make local trade work"
79294,342417,4,Djmkayak,19/08/2018,We have just spent a night on this place. calm near the city. no parking problem. very flat ground.

79299,3145106,3,Evawen,14/08/2023,"Magnificent campsite, but not at all suitable for motorhomes the pitches and paths are very small you have to maneuver and even when maneuvering it does not always go through. 3 changes of location in 4 days each time the same hassle! The swimming pool is superb the beach a few steps away. Exorbitant price over 100€ per night for 2 adults and 2 children 1 year and 5 years old. Very clean sanitary"
79299,2833848,5,Jenpii,08/06/2023,"Very nice place to spend several days, especially with kids. The amenities are good and very clean and service was friendly. We visited Barcelona from here by train (1,2h) which was 40€ family ticket (2 adults & 2 children)."
79299,2810875,4,MaVoCoe,02/06/2023,"A great campsite where you can spend several days. Clean, organized and camping quality are definitely given here. There are nice shade and sun spots and the prices are reasonable. One star deduction for the fact that 4.60 euros are charged per day per dog. You should choose an arrival time well before 8 p.m., as a full day will be charged despite late arrival"
79299,2757548,5,MF1,17/05/2023,Very clean site - showers great and everything is very clean  - pitch 3002 a standard pitch is right beside the gate that leads onto promenade / beach we had the sun all day long
79299,2716784,3,aiguille2019,02/05/2023,"indeed large campsite with very nice sanitary facilities. but when you are placed on a very comfortable pitch (8€ more) and the next morning the work of large construction sites for setting up the surroundings of the campsite begins, with trucks, backhoe loaders, etc. just in front of your cc. one has the impression of having been taken for C..!"
79299,2711291,3,FreekV,30/04/2023,"You walk from the campsite onto the boulevard to Blanes, which is very nice. The standard pitch is particularly tight and between the permanent residents. Sanitary is super clean. Unfortunately, the swimming pool was still closed to the great disappointment of our children."

79299,2363669,4,benandjerrys,12/09/2022,"Very good, clean sanitary area. Good restaurant, great value for money! Great swimming pool with a nice children's area. Located right on the promenade to Blanes and the beach. Unfortunately no fine sand. The plots could be a bit bigger and more separated, but sufficient. Overall recommended."
79299,2303228,2,lenou03,26/08/2022,"Campers flee! This is an XXL version caravan and bungalow park. On the other hand, nickel sanitary facilities and a brilliant children's pool. For us, it's a mistake."
79299,2279614,5,Aurelie8779,21/08/2022,Great campsite! it's been 20 years since I've been back there the toilets/showers have been redone they are impeccable there are games for children. The swimming pool is a paradise for children. The beach is at the foot of the campsite to access it there is a gate also with a code to return to the campsite. The emptying is done in the other part of the campsite because it is separated into 2.
79299,2111449,5,Heype,23/07/2022,"Campsite with direct access to the beach. Within walking distance of the center (2km). Little privacy because you are as good as against each other. Pitches under pine trees providing shade. Very friendly staff, super well maintained sanitary facilities and swimming pool. Fairly pricey, we paid €160 for 2 nights with 3 people with electricity in July, but it was worth it."
79299,1988922,4,marjanvergaelen,18/06/2022,"Direct access to the beach. Beautiful places. Perfectly new and beautifully maintained sanitary facilities. Close to downtown, restaurants and shops. Internet is paid but regularly cuts out. This should be a workaround. In June we pay € 22.00 with ACSI."

Very international audience, we stood next to a Belgian, a Dutchman, a Swede and of course a Spaniard. Very nice. Unloading greywater in the car wash. Sometimes dogs bark that won't stop, but Spaniards apparently don't hear that."
79299,1353759,4,Remolin,23/07/2021,"Good camping, with good facilities and swimming pools. It is a camping for caravans but motorhomes are welcome and our vehicles fit perfectly, even large ones."

79299,919837,4,FrancescMR,02/08/2020,"The pool area is great and if you have children, they will surely enjoy themselves here. The services are especially clean. I do not put 5 stars because it is not adapted for MOTORHOMES ... there are no specific services. There is to empty black but not to load clean (only in ""comfort"" pitch) and not to empty gray."
79299,563144,2,PaloisFB,19/07/2019,No evacuation of greywater. Filling drinking water only on comfort sites (no free). Otherwise no possibility. Only unsafe water. Staff very good for some. Less for others. Not in very clean sanitary culture. But I've seen better ones. To finish too crowded.
79299,529720,4,Rafen,26/06/2019,"Camping with clean services and large plots. Good swimming pools with games for children. No problem to load and empty AN, AG and AB from AC. Mains connection with schuko plug. Good treatment of the staff. Exit to the promenade (ends at the campsite) with enough stretches of bike lane. The only negative thing that in early June to leave after 12.00 had to pay full day."
79299,335289,3,graniia,15/08/2018,"Good camping with spectacular treatment, good plots and perfect location for the beach. As cons a beautiful road runs through the campsite and toilets and a little bit scarce. Attentive to reservations are only returned 30 days in advance."
79299,317569,2,cecile_andre,06/08/2018,"We only put 2 stars, because of the lack of service for motorhomes, we can not fill and no facility to drain. Given the importance of camping, should not they be the norm, because the tariff side, they are!"

79312,2595216,4,mashasssss,01/03/2023,We chose this parking because it’s quite near to the airport. There aren’t any services since it’s a just a small fishermen’s town but the place is quite and nobody bothered us. It can be very windy at night though.

79312,1784471,4,eiderishu,15/03/2022,"A slightly irregular place, with a slight slope in some areas. Between two beaches, accessible. Quiet as long as the planes are not heard. Not bad."

79312,1120201,1,katamarano1234,08/12/2020,Windy and in front of an industrial estate that destroys the view of the sandy beach behind. The very bumpy parking lot and the charmless town in particular. The small beach with many stones.

At least it's worth it to watch the sunset as the views are incredible.
79390,2019057,4,loppieontour,28/06/2022,"Didn't sleep here, but watched a beautiful sunset from the camper. One of the most beautiful places in the park. The road to it is quite steep and sometimes a bit narrow, but with our 7m we came up just fine. We don't know if sleeping is accepted here, we drove to the parking lot in the village after sunset."
79390,1876260,5,Bobyenvadrouille,07/05/2022,"Super spot, more suitable for vans. Superb view, picnic table, garbage can. A sunset to die for and close to the hiking departures. Nobody bothered us (passage at the beginning of May)"

79539,3142619,4,chloe1906,14/08/2023,"Quiet and clean area, on the edge of a river in which you can swim. Free water + emptying services work very well. Near the village. 4G ok, no electricity. About fifteen CC this day."

79539,3086082,5,Paulichi,06/08/2023,"Beautiful and quiet place, we bathed in the Jerte river and went up to the Nogaleda waterfalls through a super beautiful route through the mountains. The motorhome area is very small, only for four. When we arrived it was full but we parked next to the river (there were more) and they didn't tell us anything, I don't think they have a problem. We did not use the services."
79539,3052059,4,arsmo,31/07/2023,"Great area. It is the second year that we stopped. Possibility of bathing in the river, restaurants, cafeterias, supermarket nearby. Quiet place despite what they say about dogs, in the villages hearing dogs, roosters, bells is something normal."

River beach very close. !!!!Buy, eat and drink where they take care of us!!!! Thank you very much to the City Council."
79539,2956404,5,vanesomalo,12/07/2023,We have spent two nights in July and it was very good. right next to the river with natural pools. The only drawback is that in a nearby farm there was a dog that did not stop barking in the two nights we stayed
79539,2949025,4,echeokhai,11/07/2023,"It's okay, next to the river, but the squares are a little sloping and in the sun, much better right next to it, which is much more level and there is shade, to sleep peacefully, so at 7:30 they started working with machinery in a workshop which is right in front"

Good area for walking and cycling with other villages within easy reach. We visited the tourist information office in Cabazuela for a map of the area showing how much there is to do here.
79539,2718259,3,gustavo_m,03/05/2023,"very narrow streets to get to. The place is fine (few parking spaces) but, it's 12AM and the dogs keep barking. And well, it is what it is, we arrived late and it was not possible to continue the trip."
79539,2683960,5,acinipo-,20/04/2023,"Hello mates. We have arrived today in this very cozy little town. The area is small, only 4 spaces, but you can park in the surroundings.

79539,2675221,4,soyyo22,16/04/2023,"Thanks to the municipality, the only place with services in Valle del Jerte. And thanks to the neighbors for their generosity and patience, the area is so small that most of us make use of the parking spaces next to the area, a quiet street parallel to the river that a week ago was full of ac and Campervans. Please, let's respect these spaces and take care of the placement of the AC."
79539,2669654,5,PituPitu,14/04/2023,A unique place by the river. If you are brave you can bathe in the river. It is well maintained. Places like this need to be taken care of.

79539,2650039,5,anikanezka,08/04/2023,"Small but charming area. In the middle of Easter the town and surroundings of the area full of AC and vans, without any problem. The neighbors, although overwhelmed by the crowd, are charming. Logically with so many people, there was a long queue to empty and fill, but these services are free and working well. 100% recommended. Navaconcejo never disappoints!!"
79539,2648351,2,LaBichadeElchi,07/04/2023,"overcrowded. It's for 5 vehicles and when we arrived there were 34... people park all over the street like it's the area. Impossible to discharge gray water or catch clean. Lots of queues... Good idea on the part of the town hall, but very small."
79539,2647253,5,mcselma,07/04/2023,"It is the only one in the area that has download and upload services! Everything perfect but overcrowding for these services and horrible queues, we need more areas with services"
79539,2646674,4,Chiclana,07/04/2023,"Ideal place to do the Ruta de las Nogaleas. It is appreciated that the City Council has opted for motorhome tourism. The problem is that since there is no other Area for loading/unloading in the valley, too many ACs are concentrated in a small space. However the site is recommended"
79539,2645738,4,txu-txu,07/04/2023,very good site. Excess of vehicles although the site and the perfect location. Garcías to the City Council for the site
79539,2643223,4,SENDEGUS,06/04/2023,Area with all services. Overnight without problems. It was super crowded due to the cherry blossoms and Easter. A magnificent initiative of the city council.
79539,2642810,5,XuanAlonso,06/04/2023,"It is a small area with 5 spaces, but there is a lot of parking, it is full of DHWs and they do not fine for spending the night, the area is very quiet and has gray, black and filling water services. It is next to the river, 300 meters from the center, There are several routes to walk the Nogalea waterfalls and the walk along the river to Cabezuela del Valle. On Wednesdays there is a market with products from the area."
79539,2641408,2,lyviajera,05/04/2023,"area with very few parking spaces, most of us were parked on the edges of the road, it is right next to an aluminum company and on the other side of the river, the town did not seem like much to us, to spend time, rather alone to spend the night en route, what is very striking are the cascades of nogaledas, I advise if you are going to be there to see them although the climbs are important"
79539,2640905,5,Dragonite,05/04/2023,great site. very comfortable for gray black and carry water and free. a lot of peace to sleep next to the river. highly recommended
79539,2637587,4,Alzu,03/04/2023,"The area is small, when we arrived, on a Monday, there were already more than 10 motorhomes outside the area. Even so, we stayed two nights and used the gray and black water point. Thanks to the council for this area and for dropping off all of us who parked next to it. Do not miss the route of the Nogaledas"
79539,2637456,1,MONTINEZ,03/04/2023,"Impossible to park, full of motorhomes and vans in the surroundings, even making maneuvering difficult. We have emptied and continued our journey. Thanks to the municipality for trying, we are much@s on these dates."

79539,2616768,2,Caravanadominguera,20/03/2023,"This area is overrated, honestly. I don't like it at all, the double meaning of the street to enter and exit, the first because they park cars where they shouldn't, leaving the street narrow, if two motorhomes coincide, you have to go back, and it's an odyssey. Even so, thanks to the town because it is the only area in the entire Valley and it is appreciated! But if you don't need services or passes, throw away miles."
79539,2614472,5,rocinante,18/03/2023,"very good place, it was full, but we could see what was all very careful"
79539,2608275,5,jmcolonc,13/03/2023,"Very well-kept site, esplanade near the Los Nogales route, next to the river and good views... Let's take care of the site, it has to replenish water, emptying gray and black water."
79539,2607940,5,RichardBurkhalter,13/03/2023,"park a little tight. very good for 1.2 nights. we arrived on a Sunday. many cars parked everywhere for football. We were lucky to be able to park with the trailer, not a lot of places. thanks to the community."
79539,2600078,5,FranEP,05/03/2023,"A prize area. Next to the Jerte river, with emptying and filling services. Let's take care of her because she is a luxury. It is small, but cosy. I have rested very well. Minimum noises. During the day more hustle because there is a sports center next door, but it does not bother at all. Very nice locals. To come back!?"

79539,2276609,2,mpl251276,21/08/2022,Good area with all services. We have spent a Saturday night and it has been impossible to sleep due to the music of a nearby disco.

79539,2154135,4,Marcos12,01/08/2022,"The service area is great and very new, just 300 m away there is a nice beach to enjoy the river. The bad thing was that there was a lot of noise at night and at 7:30 a.m. in the Aluminum workshop next door they were already working flat out..."
79539,2042395,5,laika10,06/07/2022,"Very good site. It has the necessary services for the change of water, clean and cared for. Parking with 4 delimited spaces, flat next to the river with good views. Illuminated, quiet and safe area. Calm night without noise, ideal for a good night's sleep."
79539,1993572,5,Fernandogil,20/06/2022,"Chapo for the town hall. Cared for, well located and free. The only but is that the river bank is full of garbage remains. Two beach bars nearby to eat right in front of the river beaches and very close to the route"

79539,1891171,5,kekoyAle,15/05/2022,"Fantastic site, next to the river. The gps sends the wrong street where you can not go over a bridge, you have to go through the street parallel to the one indicated. With agora and services.

79539,1839416,5,pellons,19/04/2022,"Very good area for motorhomes. Only room for 5 but parking in line with the river you can. The gorge of Las Nogaleas is very beautiful with some beautiful waterfalls. Gray and black water can be emptied in the area, water can also be recharged, but notice to those who carry a hose, the hitch is not 1/2, it is smaller. Thank you City Hall of Navaconcejo."
79539,1838989,4,pamuxa,19/04/2022,Next to the river Jerte. With all the emptying and filling services. Good to do the Nobaledas route. Near the center.
79539,1838507,3,Monan,19/04/2022,We have slept one night and the truth is that a lot of noise. This week they celebrate Los Quintos and throw firecrackers and play music until late. We who have two dogs have suffered a bit. This week I do not recommend it. We had planned to spend another night but we have left. A shame.

79539,1831078,5,1978Canto,17/04/2022,We were lucky to park in the area. All the services. Easy to get to and signposted. Los Nogales Route (beautiful). We bought several things in town but we thought the bread (wood-fired) and the torrijas were very good!
79539,1826899,5,Fyrst,16/04/2022,"Very good area by the river. The access is somewhat narrow and there may be some saturation in high season, but it is still a good place to spend the day and spend the night."
79539,1826195,4,Dinoteam,16/04/2022,"We must thank the municipality of Navaconcejo for the facilities set up for motorhomes and campers. The problem is space, 4 spaces and these days we have counted 40 vehicles parked on the river bank, although none were sanctioned. Nearby there are several bars where you can eat the local cuisine and the route of the waterfalls, which is wonderful. It does not have toilets. Thanks for the area."
79539,1825124,4,EldaDC,15/04/2022,Only 4 seats for about 50 motorhomes that were there these days of Easter. It is true that sleeping outside the designated places has been allowed without any problem. The black and clean taps are poorly placed since it is in the black tap where the filling hose can be connected more easily. The route of the waterfall of the nogaledas starts from there. Very nice.
79539,1822347,5,Kamubi,14/04/2022,"Next to the river. Very calm. Few places, we could only carry water and empty the poti. Very clean and careful. A joy that there are sites of these free."

79539,1820117,3,Caravanadominguera,13/04/2022,"Impossible to park, the whole street full of cars and motorhomes. A mess to get in and out because you have to go through the same place and you could only turn at the height of the area. We have liked more the tranquility of the next town and we have parked without problems. We will return another time because today impossible between crowds, noise and more."

In addition to having 4 official car parks, there is room for more. fully recommended. It only remains to thank the municipality of Navaconcejo and not like that of Jerte de pago, which only empties gray water"

79539,1735921,1,Juanangarcia,17/01/2022,"To this day it is still not possible to spend the night, the reason they put is that they are ""improving the access streets"" sounds like an excuse to me since it can be accessed without any problem and there is no machinery or any type of sign for works. ."

About 2 kilometers away there is a repsol gas station that lets you fill water by adding fuel, the very friendly clerk asks you if you need water rubber for filling. Is another option"

The place and the area are incredibly beautiful and picturesque. the people are nice and the mobile home owners are accepted in the area. You can swim in the river and there are numerous other ways to spend your free time. However, if you can't sleep when the dogs are barking, you shouldn't come here."

79539,1220551,4,hwneumann,27/05/2021,"Well-equipped parking space right on the river, supply and disposal flawless. The five spaces are always occupied, but there are other caravans in the parking lot next door, which is well tolerated. Not least because of this, the length of stay is limited to 96 hours in a week."
79539,1206927,4,Iscafe,19/05/2021,"Good area, with all emptying / filling services, practically within the town. From here you can start the route of the Cascadas de las Nogaleas, about 8km. And do not forget to buy in Spring, the cherries of the Valle del Jerte."

79539,1162686,4,Loma116,01/04/2021,"AC area highly recommended. A favor that I ask the administrators of the Area: Replace the tap that has a thread for the one that does not. The one with a thread is on the discharge side of the WC and the other, since it does not have a thread, it is almost impossible to fill the tank with clean water. With this change, the area would be 5 Stars. Thank you"
79539,1158876,4,lgte,27/03/2021,"Very good area. pleasant. It's a shame that the threaded faucet is the one on top of the black drain instead of the one on the other side. I couldn't park in the area itself but there was space next to it and it was just as good. Fantastic for doing the Walnut Tree Route, highly recommended. good mobile coverage"
79539,1156488,5,Rulotmovil,23/03/2021,Ideal for spending the night and doing nearby routes. Very good equipment and new everything. Only the same cars are always parked. But there is parking next to the area as long as the passage of other local vehicles is respected. It has allowed us to spend several days in the Jerte and come back here to sleep.
79539,1153726,5,MicSimo,19/03/2021,"Beautiful area facing the river, all flat and quiet. the services very clean and functioning. The only bad thing is that it only has 4 ""official"" seats, we managed to get one but many caravans had to park on the street."

We spent one night and it was perfect, we were 9 motorhomes and although only 4 fit on the platform, we have more space in the surroundings. The route of the waterfalls one pass, but beware that it is hard, it goes up a lot in a very short time, but the effort is recommended. Thank you very much to the town and its neighbors for making this possible."

79618,458125,5,delpouve,18/04/2019,"Like, I said in the previous comment, the premises of the restaurant are super nice, we could make water for the van, the restaurant is at the top, grilled over a wood fire, for a very reasonable price, 10 €, the meal, with coffee and pastries. Friendliness and good humor offered, we recommend this spot without any reservation."
79618,457425,3,delpouve,17/04/2019,"Part in tar at the back of the restaurant, and covered part, large yard on high. Picnic tables and benches, barbecue and two water points, presto type tap without thread and at least 15 meters from the path where you can access with the van. Alternative, service station with water up before the spot, filling pipe. Contact with locals, super nice."

79630,2857127,5,hiltonspride,15/06/2023,Wonderful place. Right next to the river which is shallow enough in places for swimming. Excellent if you have a dog like we do that loves water. Calm and peaceful. Access in is a narrow road with no passing places. Would imagine anything larger than our campervan would have problems unless you are feeling brave.
79630,2772387,5,Roaldnorway,21/05/2023,"Really relaxing place to relax, sleep overnight and swim in the river. One of the only places that we stayed more than one day. Upon arrival through Xativa, you wouldn’t expect much, yet well worth to continue to this free camping location right by the river. We did a nice cool short hike right along the river right from there towards Bellus. (Not worth going into or past Bellus though.)"
79630,2690293,5,mouch,23/04/2023,"Great spot, lots of room, we had a great night there, even though the neighbors are celebrating a birthday. Leave this spot clean."

79630,2674793,5,vwbrash,16/04/2023,Our very first time in our camper.  Beautiful and tranquil place right on the river. We were with friends in their 7.5m motor home and would say that the route is quite tight through the village  and maybe a problem if you were in a bigger one.
79630,2640770,5,javichimeno,05/04/2023,"Highly recommended! 100% natural environment, quite flat and with a lot of space. We had a night on our way south and had a luxurious stay. Squirrels chasing each other through the trees and possibility to do routes, also climbing. Let's keep these spaces clean!"

79630,2368381,5,Calether,13/09/2022,"Very nice place, quiet and clean! In the afternoon many people walking with dogs but at night we have been alone. The great river to cool off a bit"
79630,1928031,3,LaFineEquipe,29/05/2022,"Beautiful place, the river is perfect for cooling off! But the night was painful because it was impossible to sleep with the fiesta improvised by our motorhome neighbors (who came to take advantage of the climbing site). The site is also very popular with locals, so there is a lot of traffic, probably more on weekends."
79630,1895584,5,LaFrancy,17/05/2022,beautiful place!!!! HIGHLY recommend spending a few nights here !!! tranquility guaranteed! the river is perfect for taking a bath when it's too hot! special and magical place.
79630,1887820,5,hannahnas,13/05/2022,"Great place, clean, room for everyone, walks and climbing possible. The river is swimmable, be careful, there is a current! forbidden to make fire, garbage cans on site."
79630,1863944,5,EmielEefje,01/05/2022,Beautiful place. At night you can hear the river flowing. Stood there from Saturday to Monday with plenty of others. On Sunday I would avoid the place due to huge crowds. The road to it is very narrow and an oncoming vehicle is a challenge with our 7.5 meter motorhome. Well worth it!
79630,1730638,4,Unicore,09/01/2022,"A very nice place, unfortunately we only saw it from afar, as we drove up from the wrong side and got stuck in front of a residential building. Be sure to approach from the west!"
79630,1711270,4,Herbstkind,17/12/2021,We spent two cozy nights here in the middle of nature. There is little sun at this time of year. She disappears behind the mountain at 3 p.m. We went on a varied 5.5 hour hike (on Komoot).
79630,1703583,5,david465,05/12/2021,very nice site. there are more vans and motorhomes you feel accompanied.
79630,1703153,4,10-06_am,04/12/2021,"DO NOT USE WAZE! Nor Maps for that matter, which does anything ... Prefer Maps and follow your path carefully. Very complicated to find and access not so easy, however, the place is incredible! Peaceful, beautiful, beautiful ride. Do not hesitate to walk to the river, very beautiful body of water with the mountain in the background. Calm night"

79630,1212156,5,Francis2408,23/05/2021,"An absolute dream, small bays between trees, hiking trails nearby and a river. We loved it. Completely quiet at night, stood on a Thursday with 2 other campers. The road to get there is very narrow (but tarred) for the last 3-4km, oncoming car traffic will still be ok, no idea how to solve that when a mobile home comes towards you. We were lucky and everything was free. Also 1-2 tight corners, guess everything over 7m could have problems."
79630,1185185,5,Kat_Chris,04/05/2021,"Beautiful place, in the middle of nature. We had no problems with our 7m Eura either, the road here is even tarred. Only stupid with motorhome oncoming traffic. I recommend enjoying this place during the week, on the weekend it was very crowded and sometimes a bit louder. Otherwise just fantastic. And please, please take your rubbish with you and maybe some more."
79630,1179448,4,IranBerna,25/04/2021,"Very quiet place, we stayed for two days, we did the night and we had no problem. At night when the river is next to it, we have a frog orchestra but in the morning the birds wake us up. There is a garbage container. Let's take care of our environment."
79630,1178783,4,Didiousse,24/04/2021,"Excellent very quiet place with plenty of possibilities for outdoor activities. Evening concert of toads. No service, difficult road to access it, but once installed it's excellent."

79630,1173297,5,Vegamp,13/04/2021,"We stayed overnight on 04/12/21. Lots of people during the day, but quiet all night, we only had 2 campers. Waking up to the song of the birds and the sound of the water is priceless. Wonderful site"
79630,1173000,5,TheDude67,13/04/2021,Fantastic safe parking with great walking/ trekking routes and fabulas swimming spots.Very busy at weekends. Forestry rangers patrol twice a day as fires/ barbecue are not permitted. Staying overnight is allowed and is very popular for Spanish AC and campervans.

79630,1168947,4,cloud400d,06/04/2021,Very nice place although quite full of campers and caravans. During the day (at Easter) it was very crowded with cars and people who come to spend the day. Otherwise all good !!
79630,1160146,5,Samfoc,29/03/2021,"Spectacular place to spend the night a couple of days. no services, just containers. starting point of routes, climbing schools and the Ferrata del aventador. quite large, it is parked next to the river, we will repeat."

79630,1147894,5,Niko_,07/03/2021,"Very good place to spend the night, to be next to different climbing sectors and nature walks. We miss garbage (there is one at the entrance) and picnic tables. It is a very large place, although quite crowded as well."
79630,1140440,5,ben_vivi,21/02/2021,"Quite a few van and motorhomes, but very large and right next to great walks and climbs."
79630,1134455,5,happy666campers,01/02/2021,"Stayed here 2 nights. Quiet, clean and well used area for hiking, climbing and cycling. Caves close by. Narrow access for last 1000m but manageable, especially if you do not met anyone coming in the opposite direction, we were in a 7.5m motorhome. Recommend and would return in the future"
79630,1121945,4,bitesize,18/12/2020,"Lovely quiet overnight stop. Didn’t explore the surroundings, apart from the very short walk to the river by the little bridge, so can’t really rate it properly. You could actually park a van right by the river but the stoney road/track put us off, maybe if you have a 4x4. There was a car parked there anyway. There was a bin at the entrance, but no other services."
79630,1070650,4,Chowhound63,26/09/2020,"Awesome place to go, will return, we were in a small van but we saw other fiat high roof vans there so access is ok with caution."
79630,1069550,4,gonga92,25/09/2020,"Plenty of space to park, on Sundays many people start to arrive early as there are many trails for hiking. The site at night very quiet and with a lot of nature. A few steps away is a special river to cool off a bit."
79630,956805,4,RaquelCAT,13/08/2020,"August 12, 2020. DAY AND NIGHT Experience with camper: Quite quiet place. People walk by during the day and also at night. Access is a passable asphalt race. The entrance to the parking lot is unpaved, but fine. Do not park next to the preserve, because hunters come very early to kill poor animals. Having breakfast listening to gunshots is very unpleasant."
79630,935669,5,Gaellebrdy,07/08/2020,"Perfect place for a night! Short walk to a cave, swimming in the river and flat land large enough for everyone! No service"
79630,840580,5,TravelMike,28/06/2020,Very nice place but really difficult to access I recommend against the motorhome

79630,769985,5,Schneckenhausontour,18/01/2020,"Everything is fine here, there are already some Van-Lifer and other campers here. But it is well distributed in the small forest car park."
79630,758545,5,Mamat5331,28/12/2019,"Many shaded spots, hiking trails next door, river, and very quiet at night. Really a very nice place. Lots of walks during the day."
79630,753148,4,Bobstones,13/12/2019,Lovely spot more popular than the other side and less sun for the solar panel.
79630,746977,3,LuNoWik,25/11/2019,"Nice spot, gets busy with climbers, hikers and mountain bikers during weekend, with the occasional ""inconsiderate"" camper. There's a bit too much dog droppings everywhere, so be careful where you're treading. Other than that, good level spots, privacy and wind protection by trees."
79630,746309,5,eburton,23/11/2019,"A magnificent place. We only intended to stay the night, and we stayed two, had to resist the urge to stay longer. We walked into the nearby town Xativa, see the cove negra and the aqueduct. Lots of campers about but plenty of space so didn’t feel crowded. On the weekends it’s busy with walkers but the week days you have peace. The road of the approach is a bit narrow but manageable."
79630,745578,5,lewisstafford,21/11/2019,"Great spot. So nice I stayed longer than intended. 

Great for hikes in all directions, even into the town and up to the castle if you're feeling strong. Also good for climbing. 

Local foragers in the evening for mushrooms. Lots of wild herbs in the hills.

Amazing if you want to get into nature but still close to small and bigger cities. 

Don't pass without visiting."
79630,734156,5,glaadys,30/10/2019,"Excellent place. We stayed a week without any difficulty. Very nice quiet site. Water source 30 minutes walk back and forth, trash not far, hiking. Like an air of prehistory. Hard to leave. A local grandfather even offered us clementines and pomegranates. Attention campers, on Sunday 3/11/19, there is a bike race so the site will be difficult to access."
79630,733508,4,Jmnhh,29/10/2019,"If we go there late at night in the dark, it feels extremely lonely and far out. During the day some hikers, mountain bikers, school classes surfaced and you can enjoy the nature with great views of rocks with the cave La Cova Negra. Climbing rocks and hiking trails within walking distance. Now at the end of October very cold at night"
79630,726713,5,snakebar,21/10/2019,Large underground parking under umbrella pines. I highly recommend this place that we used for a single night's stay

Ideal to spend the whole weekend. Always there are Ac and van. At night there is no light, but one pass for being in the middle of nature. There are no containers in that same area so, please, take the trash and contribute to the environment. Recommended."

79630,329820,3,rapha86,12/08/2018,"Narrow access road for double direction, much caution. No signs of camping prohibition. We were quietly with chairs and tables for two nights. Car pass the weekend to a river where you can swim and have a good day, at night you feel the full nature."

My intention was to spend the night, but when I arrived I saw that the poplars shed a lot of white fluff without stopping and that there were ticks, so I looked for another place to sleep. If you don't go down, the piece of road that there is is great and there is a bit of air"

79711,538668,3,Chiki84,04/07/2019,Parking in a quiet street next to the river and the aqueduct. 20 minutes walk from the center. It does not stop being a parking lot in a street with neighbors a few meters away. Be respectful with them so we can continue to enjoy this site.

79711,491171,4,debycoles,23/05/2019,"There are dozens of places next to the road by this beautiful park. The road is noisey in the morning so if you are a light sleeper then you probably won't like it. We liked it. There are bins in the park and there is a place you could fill up a bucket with fresh water - not near the aqueduct end, the other end of the park. Merida is a Roman sensation."
79711,476205,5,PepeAC,05/05/2019,"Park with swings, zip line and fountain next to basketball courts, you can go on foot to visit Mérida."
79711,469592,4,KKF,27/04/2019,"Beware of the indications of Google, the first street that indicates to the right when you are next, is not good, follow 2 or 3 more streets and you will enter the side of the park from further back and there is good place to park"
79711,464420,5,Labaron,22/04/2019,"Very good place, next to the aqueduct and next to a park that takes you to the center of Mérida in 20 minutes. We sleep from Thursday to Friday without noise and without any problems."

79711,435719,2,chilledout,03/03/2019,"Parked here for afternoon. Its parking in bays alongside a very busy road, drivers were racing along then breaking for the speed bumps. It was a good walk to the towns attractions. We left in the evening and went out of town.
A local pointed to a water fountain in the park, near a path, when we arrived, so that is there if needed."
79711,432975,2,Pacocoches,24/02/2019,Good place and quiet near the center. Good place to walk the dogs but some do not collect the poop and there is danger of staining

79711,305312,4,itxiar,29/07/2018,"We did not see the parking lot that can be seen in the photo because we arrived at night. We have slept peacefully parked on the street, and in the morning ideal to take the dog out and take a pleasant walk through the aqueduct"
79715,3184494,4,manuraidgr,20/08/2023,"Although there is a sign at the entrance that prohibits camping, stopping is not prohibited. Level area and plenty of shade. But a lot of noise. Camping and barbecues around"

79715,2504194,4,ourlifeinavan,24/11/2022,"Very close to the town. People walk around the area and some cars pass by. If it rains you cannot go into the forest area because it becomes muddy, but there is a flat paved area at the entrance to the grove. Illuminated area and there are picnic areas."
79715,2301933,5,DinoOnTour,25/08/2022,"What a great pitch. We are excited. We are almost alone between trees with shade and opportunities to grill. The swimming pool is right next door and bars and restaurants are also easily accessible. No further infrastructure, of course, but we didn't expect that either."
79715,2287615,5,DragonetaBCN,23/08/2022,"Lots of shade, we slept almost alone and undisturbed. We got very close to the La Vega bar, which is also highly recommended! Nice and well priced."
79715,2144453,5,VeLo4,30/07/2022,"Very nice, quiet and full of trees. Next to the river, there are grills, a promenade and two steps from the town. We were en route and stopped here for one night. It was a perfect site."
79715,1926256,5,curtisg53,28/05/2022,"A fantastic location beside the river with ample shade between the trees. Had the whole area to ourselves Friday and Saturday, just a few locals passed walking their dogs and two fishermen. River very cold but managed a swim after a hot day walking Camino de Santiago from Leon. Table tennis along the path."
79715,1914005,4,Zevvie,25/05/2022,"Very nice spot, although we were very unlucky: the nearby camping was apparently renovating their swimming pool. Jackhammer drilling commenced at 7 in the morning, under normal conditions undoubtably a great spot."
79715,1823566,5,Txapelpunk,15/04/2022,A very quiet place where we have spent one night. Despite having other vans there is enough space to be calm. I recommend it.

79715,1425562,5,aliciadj,08/08/2021,Perfect parking for overnight (we had a van and horse van). The parking lot is very large and there were few people. A river lines the parking lot all the way and a swimming pool is right next to it. Very few shops in orbigo.
79715,1392627,5,pablines,02/08/2021,"We spent a very quiet night, with more motorhomes. During the day, the perfect place to spend it quietly. Pool, very cool playground and bar next door is ok"
79715,1390252,5,Nika80,01/08/2021,A great and quiet place to spend the night. Chopera with a lot of space where we also find other motorhomes. Next to the municipal swimming pool that enlivened us the morning with music and a step away from the medieval-style bridge of the honorable passage. Area with barbecues and near a bar-restaurant.
79715,1274007,5,leaodapraia,24/06/2021,Very nice place and very nice village. We didn't spend the night but there seems to be no problems

79715,988476,5,Bastida,21/08/2020,"Good poplar, quiet and some shade. The tv is caught bad, but it is the least. Attached restaurant that eats well and cheap."
79715,965993,4,Zaldiko,15/08/2020,"In a poplar grove, a huge place, looking a bit you get more than decent shade, today there are quite a few cars near the riverbank occupying tables and with their own no problem and even so they do not occupy even 25% of the place, quiet to sleep, great, next to the Orbigo river."
79715,953369,5,marcmcfly,12/08/2020,"Super quiet place even in summer. There are 3 picnic tables and 5 bbq spots. You can wash yourself in the river just behind. Countless spots to park, all in the shadow (only sunny the first hours of the day).

The ground is a bit irregular, we kind of struggle to find a completely flat place for all 4 wheels."
79715,678324,4,hwg,06/09/2019,"Very nice, spacious place under trees, very quiet. Every now and then a couple of dog owners come by the adjacent canal. But be careful: there are mosquitoes!"

79727,2848473,2,pnmarkham,12/06/2023,"Visited yesterday. Closed.  They are open late June to mid September so check first. Both car parks chained. Can’t comment if if they would allow dinners to sleep over but not a cheap menu so beware.  There are a couple of small lay-by site in the village where you can squeeze in, locals don’t seem to mind if, as usual you are considerate.  The village is lovely if you get out and walk down."
79727,2595554,2,floid,01/03/2023,"Parking for the Mirasierra restaurant, but the terrizo that has access without a gauge 100 meters from the one indicated. We had lunch in the restaurant and the food was very tasty and good. In summer or holidays I think it is advisable to make a reservation to be able to have lunch and thus be able to park. In the town there is no place to park motorhomes."
79727,1730838,5,kikaneta,09/01/2022,It is worth parking and eating at the restaurant. All super rich and charming. They even let us eat inside with the dog.
79727,1157845,5,ea1qa,26/03/2021,"Thanks to the mirasierra restaurant, we were able to park, if not, impossible ... It deserves to spend some money in said restaurant."
79727,764858,1,mikel82,05/01/2020,"The same thing that I commented in the other place ... everything monopolized by restaurants ... and on top of that it was closed, we did not see ethical parking there so we left"

79729,2420415,1,Monchis,03/10/2022,"We traveled by motorhome and it was impossible for us to park as it was full of cars. If you continue down to the exit of the town to the right there are two options to be able to park or at least spend the night, we discovered them when we left the next day after being able to spend the night half parked in a bend at the entrance that there was a font. The beautiful town!"
79729,1894609,2,LMV17,16/05/2022,The town in general is not easy to park for more than 7m...we parked here because we arrived on a Sunday at 6-7pm and we had to occupy two places. so better visit when the mogollón leaves...
79729,1813953,3,zurix,10/04/2022,Very crowded. beautiful town.
79729,1807803,5,NAIKEROB,06/04/2022,"Parking for cars but you can park a not very bulky motorhome or camper. For me, the best parking to leave the AC and visit the town, which is very beautiful. It does not have any services, only the garbage cans to throw all the garbage that we have"
79729,1785156,4,distritocamper,16/03/2022,"During the week it is great because there is enough space to maneuver even though it is a car park. Very close to the town and it is well worth a visit, it also has several sources of fresh and drinking water where you can refill your water bottles :)"
79729,1707977,2,bikefire,11/12/2021,"Vehicle parking. There is no room for a 7.5m AC. and if you park ... then when it fills up you can't maneuver to get out -beware-. Better to pass the town and park further down, where there are some crosses. Then you go for a ham at Lopez Puerto sausages and for wine, beer and honey at La Zorra wineries. It was recommended to us by a lady we found walking around and she was totally right. Helpful and friendly people 100%"
79729,1236126,3,Jorge02,04/06/2021,Just if you take a motorhome
79729,1088996,2,RubenRu,11/10/2020,Small parking for cars and little else. It is inclined enough across its surface so sleeping is somewhat difficult. It is quiet in the month of October and close to the walking route.
79729,864729,5,Fotografiayvideo,12/07/2020,"The town is a wonder of beauty, I recommend a snack in Plaza Mayor. We took a transit XL and we were able to park and stay overnight, it was lucky, it was full."
79729,789638,1,pablines,01/03/2020,"On busy days in the area, refrain from large motorhomes, are places for tourism. The town is worth it, it is very beautiful, and it has very nice hiking trails, but it is an odyssey to park. We managed to sleep here since our car is very small. Quiet night. Parking slightly inclined. A star for parking ......... a ten for the town."
79729,765370,5,montiluvan,06/01/2020,"Very small parking, enough for a van. We took a place, although in the morning it was already full. As it was a public holiday, we had no noise from either the garbage truck or the bus line. A little further ahead there are another 4 or 5 spaces to be able to park in battery and then already the parking of the sausage shop or the restaurant. There is not much else to park and the town is worth it"
79729,764853,1,mikel82,05/01/2020,"Too bad ... such a beautiful town and that there are not even places ... it is all monopolized by the restaurants ... that on top of that you cannot consume because they are closed ... well, a shame, I give it a star for what if I can't comment"

79729,484804,1,Perdi2xelmundo,15/05/2019,"It is a pity that such a nice town does not have a suitable parking for motorhomes. It is practically impossible to park anywhere, only cars fit. We finally left it a little lower, in a car park marked only for cars, in the sawmill, but wider than this one. Try not to go on weekends because then it is impossible to park a motorhome."
79729,461006,1,aidatoig,20/04/2019,"Impossible to put a car a little big and occupation to the maximum, only parking of the town too small"
79736,3249753,1,FFRM,02/09/2023,"Parking in the greenery surrounded by repeaters and antennas. Around 00:00/01:00 some Spaniards arrived en masse and spent 2 hours skidding and drifting in the car park. They weren't even very skilled (two cars crashed into a curb). Therefore little security and confidentiality. Personally they didn't bother us, but you never know. Without services."
79736,3136200,4,MaloOlivier,13/08/2023,We spent one night there. We were 4 trucks. A bit of traffic during the night but nothing disturbing. superb view of Oviedo and the mountains. 2 steps from pre-Romanesque churches and Christ the Redeemer.

79736,1632523,4,Tompo,08/10/2021,We spent the night from Thursday to Friday. Alone in the parking lot. A couple of vehicles came with loud music and honking but nothing that can't be fixed with earplugs if you're a light sleeper. Ideal for a walk when you wake up. There is hardly any traffic and it is very quiet. It is surrounded by mobile repeater antennas and television. Stunning night views of Oviedo.
79736,1489261,4,blanks,20/08/2021,"It is in a place with quite a slope, it is a bit cold, but it is worth it with the views over Oviedo. There were not many people at night, it was quite quiet, although in the morning cars start arriving to visit the nearby monuments. Worth"

Area is not flat, bumpy, covered by trees and depending where you park, very exposing. Barking dogs in the night, very few people walk by late afternoon and early morning.

Sunrise and sunset highly recommended."
