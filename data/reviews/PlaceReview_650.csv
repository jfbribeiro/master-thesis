19558,3220329,4,eldelacajita,26/08/2023,"Spacious, with good views and quite flat. The bad thing is that the access is very steep and you have to make a quite forced curve to enter or exit the main road. It is the only parking lot in the sanctuary where vehicles taller than 5 m are allowed to park (except for buses). We didn't spend the night, but it seems like a quiet place. Toilets in the gift shop in the other parking lot."
19558,3196041,3,MiguelMY,21/08/2023,"We have parked to see the sanctuary and take the Campas de Urbia route. The only bad thing is the strong smell of urine in the area, otherwise it would be a good place to spend the night."
19558,3127864,5,BartNomade,12/08/2023,Great location for visiting the Basilica or hiking the trails. Plenty of vacancies for AC of all sizes. No services.

19558,2311374,5,armenk74,27/08/2022,"Large car park arranged in the form of terraces that can accommodate CCs of all sizes. For large CCs, choose the upper terraces because the access ramp is narrow. Very random mobile connection. 3 or 4 beautiful hikes to do from the parking lot of Arantzazu above. We did the n°210 with a baby carrier, quite perilous at the start, with 440m of elevation over 5.5km. Top !"

I give it 3 stars because it has no services, not even trash cans. Nothing, a shame because some bins would make the place cleaner."

19558,300192,4,padraigl,25/07/2018,"Stayed here 2 night including Sunday. This carpark stayed mostly empty on the Sunday with all the visitor's. But the others closer were full. During week all this carpark is empty but on weekends it's best to go to the middle or bottom section.

There are no services only some bins. Onati is closest for services. There are no shops here also. I bought bread on Sunday at a stall but that's not available the rest of the week.

This village is amazing. The church for some contemplation and the walks for viewing the scenery.
We walked the 22 (PR GI 3006) and the 27 (PR GI 3005) routes. 
The 22 passed through a restaurant in the hills in the Urbia green plain. This is worth a visit. The first part uphill through the the woods to the restaurant is well marked and shaded. The 2nd part is on the hill with no real shade for a while and is marked on the rocks.
The 27 route is a path down the cliff and then mostly woods. Another fantastic walk. 
This stop is a walkers paradise."
19558,247433,2,Ehouarn56,06/05/2018,"Parking at the edge of the road that empties completely in the evening. Not the nature, but quiet for the night with a beautiful view of the mountain and a beautiful sunset."

19585,3033144,3,gafiloupio,28/07/2023,"Deserves 5 stars because sanitary at the top. Installing washing machine... However very strict (no bike no ball) for children and yet paying all the more 3 E / children extra in addition to 15E for 2 adults not specified so in total 21E.

Request via Whatsapp will be answered in a short time.
19585,2835355,5,Easybee1,09/06/2023,We have stayed here several times and always a friendly welcome. If you have a problem give the staff a chance to rectify it as they are most helpful. You can have electricity as required One day at a time or not. If you stay more than 3 nights its cheaper. The beach and tram is 250 metres looking at the map scale. Cheap beer from the tram cantina on the beach. We will come back for certain.
19585,2776226,4,cdulbecco,22/05/2023,good area. 13 euros two people without electricity. clean bathrooms. Unlimited hot water without push buttons. no toilet paper in the bathrooms.

19585,2748150,5,sandrandradra,14/05/2023,"Good location, nice beach is just few minutes away as well as tram that takes you to Alicante. Pitches are not the biggest, but facilities were free and clean, and nights were quiet."

On arrival we were shown all the important places nearby (supermarket, bakery), everything is within walking distance. We were here at the beginning of April and there were still enough pitches available. We would love to come back - the proximity to the beach is beautiful."
19585,2681095,5,biferma,19/04/2023,"I love the excellent motorhome area with all services 200 meters from the beach with reasonable prices and a good location for everything. To put some but, the white gravel is a bit dirty."
19585,2654136,5,JuanPablo,09/04/2023,"Good place to stay for a few days and disconnect, very quiet, we have spent 5 days and we would have stayed one more day.

19585,2572360,3,Ledodo,09/02/2023,"On the vast vacant lot in front of the campsite, a quiet night in the company of a dozen other CCs. The tram 300m below along the sea will take you to Alicante center (last stop) in 25 minutes for €1.45 - ticket to take on the tram with your credit card"
19585,2559634,4,Perdi2xelmundo,24/01/2023,"Seems like a good area. The only problem is that it is practically full from October to March. But you can change water for €5 and sleep anywhere else, there are dozens of places in the area and there are no prohibitions for staying overnight (at least at this time of year)."
19585,2547728,2,Chapito,09/01/2023,"Closed parking place for Motorhome. I stayed one night and the plots are fine for a 7-meter motorhome, more difficult to access, just don't open or put the advance. Bathrooms and common areas are like construction barracks, very painful. It is a place to stop and little else. the bathrooms need some TLC."
19585,2542855,1,pitch01,05/01/2023,if you like to be crammed in like sardines with not even 50 cm between each motorhome go ahead otherwise go on your way there are plenty of extra places but of course not with service

19585,2529673,4,st1110,27/12/2022,Very good place. Everything you need is there. Showers are free and the sanitary facilities are quite clean. The location is perfect if you want to relax on the beach and be close to the center. With the tram you can get to Alicante very quickly for 1.45 euros. Very nice operator. Unfortunately a bit expensive with electricity 6 euros and washer/dryer 5 euros…
19585,2522840,4,jean313,16/12/2022,pleasant welcome.. no height or length limit there is everything you need for 13 € on December 16 without electricity..

19585,2516522,4,mariapa4182,08/12/2022,"We were in August and if what you are looking for is the beach, its location is privileged, because you have it 2 minutes away. There are plenty of shops and bars in the area You have to walk a little further to the tram stop Both the bathrooms and the services were very curious when we went and it was full To visit Alicante it's very good, you arrive in no time by tram"
19585,2505952,4,joseluisrav4,26/11/2022,"Fantastic area, we stayed for three days for €13/2 people. Well connected with the Tram."

A dryer is also available. 13 €: 2 people, a camper without electricity."

19585,2419061,3,mugje023,02/10/2022,location is fine! the place itself is expensive. plumbing is very outdated
19585,2414746,1,FelixRie,30/09/2022,"After inspecting the sanitary facilities and the bizarre registration process, we immediately left the site without staying overnight. It would make more sense to invest more in hygienic showers than in modern electronic systems, which, according to the operator, immediately transmit the data to the police and each person has to sign electronically (blank). But everyone has to know for themselves."
19585,2413920,4,Powerke,30/09/2022,"Plus: nice straight pitches, sanitary facilities are outdated but still good enough. We paid 18 euros Incl electric. Close to the beach and tram that takes you everywhere (recommended that tram). Shop about 1 km. Friendly owner. Is a wintering place. Minus: nothing for us"
19585,2389784,5,Hasen,20/09/2022,Great location for a few days by the sea. The sea is about 300m away and very nice even in September. The pitch has the features mentioned and is clean and well maintained. The Don Gato restaurant nearby is highly recommended.
19585,2294655,3,mingu077,24/08/2022,"Well located, dusty gravel floor, scorching heat without shade on our plot, near the door: the gate is heard all day and intimacy, 0 people in the corridor looking at all hours. Overcrowded beach area and to our liking, without any attractive, with a tram on the waterfront (this is not the fault of the area). Attention received and services in the area: very good."
19585,2276095,5,akacha,20/08/2022,Super! Only 200m from the beautiful beach!
19585,2264670,5,Mariuz78,18/08/2022,"Very convenient, close and clean beach. Clean bathrooms and showers, convenient loading and unloading, excellent management. Tram number 3 with a stop 200 m which takes you in 30 minutes to the center of Alicante. At 300m there is an excellent supermarket"

19585,2175806,5,annime,04/08/2022,Great place. 2 minutes to great beach. Not far to the tram purely to Alicante. Very clean and quiet. TOP!!!!
19585,2138716,5,paowow,29/07/2022,"Very nice camper area, new and close to the beach, all very clean and tidy. Nearby restaurants and supermarkets. The only flaw is that, being new, the plants are also young and the shade is scarce, however at night we never suffered from the heat and during the day we were always around or on the beach or visiting the city of Alicante reachable by comfortable tram."

19648,1789282,5,rajiso2000,20/03/2022,"Very quiet in winter, but the way to get there is quite bad, you have to go very slowly because the furniture is dismantled. Also, if it rains there is a lot of mud. From here it is 3 km to the booth to begin the trail of the jet, the chorrera chica and the rocagalgo (the path is also regular), but it is now a national park and you should not sleep. Beautiful area of Toledo."

19648,1673634,4,Gmailloc,01/11/2021,The environment is very beautiful. the stew very good and there is good coverage from Vodafone. the road is dirt and bumpy but you can get there slowly
19648,1532511,5,elipink,30/08/2021,"Spectacular free camping area with shade. You have to go down a forest track but we went well with an old motorhome. There are no services but the restaurant is spectacular. Home cooking, highly recommended stew and game. The mojitos too! The owner lives there and when the sun goes down he shows you the calves. It has a swimming pool to cool off. Everything was perfect, we will be back!"
19648,1263705,4,Rogerdeflor,19/06/2021,"No services. Good Orange coverage. Good place to spend the night in the National Park surrounded by nature. the""aterrao"" stew at the picnic area is spectacular. Idyllic place."
19648,1197867,3,MELEMAKAWEN,14/05/2021,"The site is spectacular to enjoy the tranquility and nature, the worst thing is the access, a fairly bumpy dirt track and with a steep slope, we did not stay for personal reasons when we verified that there was no Movistar coverage, to disconnect 100x100 a ten."
19648,1184092,5,morenodavid,02/05/2021,"Quiet place to spend the day and spend the night, we spent Saturday afternoon spent the night, and in the morning we did the jet route, when it was time to spend the night we were afraid of being alone, but several Campers and AC stayed, yes, that's great, there is no need to empty or refill, there is a restaurant right next door and on Sunday at noon there is an influx of people"
19648,1180859,5,Titopomi,27/04/2021,"Quiet place, especially during the week. The route to the waterfalls is very pleasant. Restaurant next door with stew, rice with lobster or venison for 12 euros. Migas at 9. Calm night. You can use the restaurant's bathrooms, but there is no loading and unloading service"
19648,1171215,3,ticu,10/04/2021,"Good place to destroy the motorhome and if it rains to stay isolated, the road is long and bad"
19648,1164030,4,MariClaire,02/04/2021,"A very good place to spend day and night. It is 3 km from the cabin of cabañeros from where the route of the jet, the chorrera chica and Rocigalgo depart. You can get to the information booth without problem, bumpy terrain, but there is no rush. The only thing that there are no water services."
19648,1081047,4,pazyfurgo,04/10/2020,"Camping area allowed, there are 5 places for motorhomes but there is a lot of esplanade with trees to spend the night. Super quiet area in the middle of nature, to get there there are 2.5km of dirt track in good condition and very wide."
19648,824096,5,Titopomi,14/06/2020,"3 km from the beginning of the hiking trails in Cabañeros. Bathing in the river possible. In the restaurant 12 euros the main dishes, very abundant. 9 euros the crumbs."
19648,809222,5,eonate,25/05/2020,Place in the middle of nature an hour and a half from Toledo. River area for bathing and camping area. Super quiet overall. We arrived on a Thursday at noon and left on Sunday. The only downside is that there is no option to load water or empty gray. There is a WC in the picnic area. Beer bottles are alcohol at € 1.30. There are people camped with tents. Ideal place to be with children.
19648,778112,5,manuelcruz,09/02/2020,"Good place to do the jet route, but be careful with the GPS can send you on other roads and end up in the river, look for the one that has the sign of the Navalucillos jet path"
19648,773479,5,dmelones,28/01/2020,"Be careful with the GPS indications that in my case gave me a very strange spin and I went down somewhere else. Directions rural house las calves, Ruta del chorro, Rocigalgo in CM-4155."

19648,440279,4,arkhaim,16/03/2019,"Beautiful site, very quiet. the coordinates of the point are bad, you have to follow the trail a little more and cross the river. These are the correct ones: 39.597379, -4.672489 the only downside is that the access forest track is steep, has bumps and sharp turns, so it can be a bit complicated to climb back (although it is wide throughout the route)."
19648,426419,5,nelipq,03/02/2019,"Very quiet and without any problem to sleep, beautiful place surrounded by nature, in the restaurant you eat well. 3 km from the parking lot where the jet route begins, I would recommend going there to start the route, you can park in that car park if the AC is not very big, even if there is a minibus xa site if it is not busy, if there is no place You can always come back. The google maps gave us a big detour along the way, but the maps took us well, follow the road that leads Rocigalgo road or the calf house. , the road is bumpy but it arrives without problems."
19648,425024,5,pusyneta,27/01/2019,Super quiet with quiet reserved seats. Ideal if you like to sleep surrounded by nature and tranquility. The picnic restaurant is very good to eat after making a good route through the Cabañeros Park. It is accessed from the CM4155 by a road that indicates RociGalgo.
19648,423866,4,nekomochi,21/01/2019,We have spent 2 days very calm and without problems. When the restaurant is open you can go to the bathroom that is outside. They have a terrific stew. The rocigalgo route begins about 3 km from here.
19648,263136,5,Rutera13,03/06/2018,"5 places reserved for motorhomes, a great site runs along a forest track. good condition, the restaurant serves a delicious stew has terrace and trampoline for children.

19649,2821100,3,ftfilipa,04/06/2023,"Area with many car parks but, currently, the car parks are, almost all, exclusive to public transport. There are about 5 places left, where we spend the night without any problems, but after 6am cars and buses go by at great speed."

19651,179163,2,leslutinsdelaforet,18/08/2017,We must not have the same notion of calm! Right next to the train tracks with a train almost every 10 minutes! Otherwise it's beautiful but impossible to sleep.

19694,1938207,2,EMAJAC,01/06/2022,"Parking, without services, next to the cemetery. A sign indicates that it is forbidden to park heavy vehicles from 8.00 to 17.00, so it can be fine to stay overnight (even if, having time, you can try to look for a better place). It is the starting point of some school buses, so in the morning it fills up with the cars of the parents accompanying the children."
19694,699214,1,Josephinemarteens,21/09/2019,Good for one night

19695,2806998,5,AWW91,31/05/2023,"Nice view of the river and you stand nice and straight. You have to be lucky with the parked boats and it depends on the day of the week, we didn't have a parked boat and the only loud ones were the locals who actually drove by very quickly."
19695,2744798,5,MontyTheMagnificent,12/05/2023,"Arrived 11am with moho to park at the top of road, with view over river. Nearby car park OK but dont like being wedged in. Quickly filled with tour buses for the day. Went hiking after a boat trip, to Casal de Loivos for amazing view & returned to 5 vans behind us for the night.  Ship docked beside, engines running, but the gentle rumble was OK. Booked at Cais Da foz - delicious & great service."
19695,2666958,2,chandeliege,13/04/2023,"very good for day parking, there is a pedestrian bridge to go and visit the city, not terrible by the way. on the other hand, to spend the night, it was very noisy, the generators of the boats, the staff leaving, arriving, a few cars, the train...we had a bad night!"
19695,2366982,4,vince97150,13/09/2022,"good location on the banks of the Douro, a little traffic during the day"
19695,2319535,4,chasspech,29/08/2022,"Good spot to sleep near the Douro. So indeed there is a little noise in the evening, but the awakening was perfect, with a swim and a breakfast above the water."
19695,2182181,2,FunVan,06/08/2022,"It didn't look bad for the night… but no! Biting little beasts, cars until late at night passing by the edge of the van … in short during the day yes, for the night no (especially if you are used to the wild … calm)"
19695,2174013,5,amatxilarrieu,04/08/2022,We stayed there for the day very nice with a magnificent view! The restaurant is not expensive and is in the 2020 backpacker's guide
19695,1956718,4,PauloMozBarbosa,07/06/2022,"Excellent view over the Douro River. Restaurants very close. Pinhão 10min walk. Note: if there is a cruise ship at the pier, there may be engine noise during the night."
19695,1948279,2,KatieCampbell,05/06/2022,Great for during the day but the cruise ship was parked here all night with it's engine on so too loud to sleep. Probably better closer to the restaurant.
19695,1904531,3,ramon67,21/05/2022,"we came to Pinhão by motorbike parked in Peso de Regua, we took it well because access to this parking lot is limited to sets of 10m..."
19695,1844389,5,biquet5155,21/04/2022,"5 stars, because this car park offers a breathtaking and splendid view of the Douro. Currently repairing the sidewalks. No service (just garbage cans). 6 or 7 motorhomes can park there. Cruise ships stop in front of us. Passing during the day, but relatively quiet at night. The little Douro train passes just above. For us, a superb stage. town 2 steps away."
19695,1772047,2,AlexandreMartins,03/03/2022,"Park on the side of the road, without clean water and cesspool. They should provide a safer space, and with minimal conditions, as the location is good, next to the river and overlooking Pinhão."
19695,1755172,5,mathou6525,13/02/2022,"Spot on the banks of the Douro which offers a magnificent view of the village of Pinhao overlooked by the vines. No worries about spending the night there, the police came by twice in the early morning without saying anything!"
19695,1637692,3,Minti,10/10/2021,"Good for one night, I would not recommend swimming as the water is polluted with fuel. There was a ship in front of us, but it didn't bother us and the engine was quite quiet. We didn't like Pinhao so much, the roads to the small villages are more recommendable."
19695,1568902,4,KristinV,11/09/2021,"Quiet night, cheap and good food in the restaurant next door"
19695,1460699,2,luisaestrela,15/08/2021,A beautiful place by the Douro river where we spent the night. It doesn't have any service except the river water...=)
19695,1425741,4,dom79000,08/08/2021,"Very nice location on the edge of the Douro with breathtaking views of the village. On the other hand, avoid the rush hour for the crossing by the iron bridge too narrow for 2 Cc. Position yourself further under the trees to avoid the hum of the boats."
19695,1409891,3,phil7985,05/08/2021,"Beautiful view of the village and the Douro. we sleep well, a bit of passage. very close to the village"

Great view"
19695,987840,3,azulejoscamp,21/08/2020,Great place to visit the city and / or hike the vineyards. The view is superb. But the location is moderately quiet for the night. We slept one night with the cars in the morning and the train at night.
19695,892704,5,molly95,23/07/2020,Lovely place to stop and the restaurant food was really good local food and wine
19695,815942,2,Freigeist12,03/06/2020,To see the place ok. It's just like that for overnight stays. In the evening a lot of public traffic and from the early morning cars driving past you at high speed.
19695,796702,4,lazergum,19/03/2020,"Beautiful view, relaxed surrounding.Not much traffic on the small road but be aware that it is NOT a complete quiet dead end road. A footbridge offers a nice riverwalk below the village, go for it!"
19695,787592,4,Maggiethegreenvan,27/02/2020,"Stayed 2 nights here, there were two other campers beside me and it was very peaceful. Beautiful view and so close to walk to town and explore."

19695,611690,2,Juldem,09/08/2019,"To flee absolutely! Day parking to visit the city and go to the restaurant. At night, the boats dock make a noise not possible, headache ensured in the early morning! To try eventually if there is no boat ..."
19695,523171,2,Aliged,21/06/2019,Definitely not a quiet night! The locals use the road as a drag strip (we swayed in the wind!) and a generator from one of the large cruise boats  ran constantly. Not much other option so drink lots of wine and you may not notice!
19695,516005,4,danamo57,15/06/2019,Nice parking along the wharf if there is no boat at the pier. Very quiet at night. We were 3 camper. Small restaurant a little before in front of the other dock. More fun than the parking next to the restaurant with garbage containers.
19695,488916,4,Laurens,20/05/2019,"Good place for overnight stay, village within walking distance. No facilities"
19695,478816,3,cofasa,08/05/2019,"Pleasant location but we could not sleep here because the engines of tourist boats do not stop, we changed places around 23h to be able to rest"

19695,444823,4,TheMotoroamers,26/03/2019,"we parked just along the road where there is more space. The cars passing by first thing were a bit disturbing and the odd train,  although a great spot for visiting the town when there's no other camping facilities."
19695,375362,4,PtitJean,16/09/2018,"Super parking on the banks of the Douro where we stayed at 3 campers in single file, superb view on waking, to recommend"
19695,350042,4,victo,23/08/2018,"Yes cool spot, a bit far from the city maybe 30 minutes walk (everything is relative ...) but well, very beautiful view, a little passage but it was reasonable. Dinner and breakfast feet in the water, great. On the other side of the bank, I swim in the Douro on the pier for information and people looking for corners to cool off, that's it!"
19695,337191,3,Thomasdod1,16/08/2018,Very good for spending the night overlooking the Douro. The train does not go far but very little passage.
19695,333320,2,lauremt,14/08/2018,"Certainly good, but armored cars. Do 200m more, you can park along the road"
19695,306929,2,loicbal,30/07/2018,We stopped there for lunch. Nice view of the city and the river but a lot of vehicles passing so not terrible to sleep.
19695,200618,3,mathieu.nandrin,06/10/2017,Sounds of boats docked indeed! but it's still relatively calm! There are parking lots a little further away that can avoid cars ;-)

19695,191785,3,titombubu,09/09/2017,Good spot if we ignore the noise of boats at the dock. Location not suitable for a motorhome but more for a van
19712,3208266,3,marzuaga,24/08/2023,"Beautiful place to spend the day, since for a few years they have NOT ALLOWED to spend the night, a shame since before it was possible and there was good coexistence... you can still enjoy the day. That if you have to get up early because in good weather it fills up. It has a shower and containers. In summer they set up a wooden table and benches."
19712,2947204,3,andiundmaeggi,10/07/2023,"Very nice place, no waste seen. It has disposal facilities and a shower. I didn't sleep there due to multiple prohibition signs. Driveway is rather steep, narrow and old."
19712,2450398,1,Frank209d,18/10/2022,"Rubbish, toilet paper, lots of flies, the smell of illegally emptied chemical toilets, not a nice beach and obviously a popular meeting place for young, loud people in the evenings and a clear ban on staying overnight. One star for the functional shower in October. No height restriction in October."

19712,1341993,2,LenaClement,19/07/2021,Very nice view but the guardia spends the evening to announce that it is forbidden to stay and sleep and that there will be a penalty if we stay
19712,1291024,5,vanlife93,02/07/2021,Superb place overlooking the ocean where we spent the afternoon + with many other van. No sign indicating an overnight ban. There is a little bit of traffic at night with the fishermen who come in the middle of the night and early in the morning.
19712,1258089,2,ibonepriba,16/06/2021,"We were fined by the Civil Guard We arrived around 7-8 in the afternoon and 2 patrols of the Civil Guard appeared, they took a look and left. We slept 2 vans. At 9 in the morning they arrived from countrymen, they denounced us for having spent the night. There was a No Camping sign, but for the night it did not put anything. According to them, the coastal law prohibits sleeping less than 100m from the coast."
19712,1237109,4,asier_roco,05/06/2021,"We spent the night and quite well !! very quiet at night very good views, picnic tables to eat, and shower, the only problem we had is that in the morning there is a lot of noise because many fishermen and divers come and wake you up !!! but nothing serious!! Some people from the place told us that the civil guard used to drop and they would not let us stay overnight! in our case it didn't happen! they did not come"
19712,1231084,5,HippalLR,01/06/2021,"Great parking with shower and tap, the police were parked next to us when we woke up but obviously they were just taking a break, they greeted us and left before we showered! I highly recommend, possibility to see the sunset at the lighthouse a little higher, have a good trip!"

19712,1036908,5,Irenesarahiro,09/09/2020,"It can be reached perfectly. very nice views. shower. rocky beach ideal to go with dogs, at least in early September. 2 nights, you are very comfortable. every night about 7 vans."
19712,1023974,5,eliavp3,03/09/2020,"Perfect place to spend the night! Sunset and sunrise are great from there. It also has 3 tables, shower, fountain and wastebasket. It is a small parking lot at the foot of a rocky beach."
19712,1023571,5,Paulineagt,03/09/2020,"Incredible spot to spend the end of the day (in the shade) and wake up to a great sunrise and try a little swim! Very accessible by a small forest road in good condition. The shower works. Quiet night, a dozen vans were there at the beginning of September but everyone was very respectful of the others. On the other hand there was a lot of waste .... what a pity."
19712,1009482,5,AdrianGhiurca,28/08/2020,"The information that this car park no longer has access is incorrect, the road is in perfect condition. 2.2m high parking in which we spent two days so we liked the place, with shower and garbage. With a rocky beach (I recommend booties) and some picnic areas, we spent two very quiet nights. The second night it rained, and there was no problem."
19712,1002906,5,pepelau,25/08/2020,"Great place! The photo is old, now there is a 2.20m high barrier. There is room for plenty of cars / vans. Picnic tables. Very quiet place in front of the sea."
19712,998844,5,IriJuanCalifornia,24/08/2020,"Attention vehicles over 2.20 do not pass! There is a fence when entering. We were super good! It is a very familiar and super quiet place, the police came but did not say anything, only to watch if the children made a bottle. Perfect site! There is a shower and a faucet and with a garbage container"
19712,891464,5,mnouvel,23/07/2020,Superb spot but this year the police forbid sleeping! We got a simple warning at 8am without a fine! They remind us that in Spain it is forbidden to sleep less than 100 m from the coast!
19712,855964,4,ayanami11,08/07/2020,Nice quiet parking by the sea with lots of space. Lots of people in high season but ok. Shower and very flat ground.
19712,845357,3,Merlevonr,02/07/2020,"Perfect for snorkeling! Also had a very quiet night. However, you have to say that it smells like pee in every corner and you have no way to empty yourself in any way. The place itself is very nice with a great view, but as already described, a bit steep when it comes to getting there. Around 8:00 in the morning the police stopped by but didn't speak to anyone, just checked that everything was right;) and drove again. In addition to us, about 6 other cars / bullis have stayed here."
19712,819962,2,dani20vt,09/06/2020,"Limited to 2.2m from June. Rest of the year, sometimes they fine. It usually patrols the Ertzaintza."

In any case, parking is comfortable but ""ugly"". We really stayed in the village because it was already late and we were tired, otherwise we would have continued on our way to more charming places."
19728,3099018,5,xuanett,08/08/2023,"Be careful parking outside the squares in Eroski, as the Police can fine you in the morning outside the red squares. And be careful with occupying two places since they are for the cars that they buy in Eroski from there that can penalize you"

The point to load water is located at the end of the site with a lamppost and if you go with a short hose it is impossible to carry water
19728,2928107,2,Chispa,05/07/2023,"The site is good, spacious spaces. And well delimited for the Ac, green area with attached playground and an eroski to be able to make purchases.

19728,1553650,3,ijkimber,06/09/2021,Like everyone else said very noisy at 5am. Polica local say parking yes camping no. So no chairs outside on the pavement.
19728,1531162,3,VWblue,30/08/2021,"We stayed from Sunday to Monday in the conditioned area, since the parking lot is at the supermarket and in principle you should not park, although even with space in the area, several parked there without any apparent problem. Good location on one side of the beach and the other in the center without having to walk too much. Much noise in the morning."
19728,1523846,4,vanlifestories,28/08/2021,"Free motorhome site with water and sewage discharge, very wide just behind the super, at night very quiet, but the super compressors make some noise."
19728,1474634,3,TelleriaEli,18/08/2021,"2 days. Noisy first thing in the morning, around 5. Good location for both downtown and the beach. Watch out! The area is only the part to park one behind the other. The large parking lot is from the supermarket. The Civil Guard remembers it and also indicates that the road cannot be obstructed while queuing to empty."
19728,1441563,4,rafaydana,11/08/2021,"We have been 2 days and very well. The only downside, and that's why we don't give it 5 stars, is the noise first thing in the morning. Add that the parking area is municipal (it is not the adjoining supermarket, which has its own parking area). Thanks Navia"
19728,1440075,4,lafurgoroja,11/08/2021,We have spent one night and great. Quiet place with a lot of asphalt parking; glued to a supermarket. There is also for gray water. And just 5 min walk from the center.
19728,1415927,1,SIMON-VIOS,07/08/2021,"The noise that those from the supermarket make from 5 in the morning is incredible. We have been in areas that are in the loading and unloading areas of supermarkets, but this one, they have to make them look. I would not recommend staying overnight here at all."
19728,1413426,1,Jomada,06/08/2021,"Impossible to rest due to the noise of the supermarket compressors. You can empty, but not fill, it is broken."
19728,1412187,4,Pinkfloydiano,06/08/2021,"Today the local was taking measurements to the cars. They told us that there was only one area in the parking lot for cars that corresponds to the road where there is access to the water services. The rest of the parking lot is not for cars. It is well signposted, I will put a photo for you, if I manage. Notice to staff. I'll tell you if I get a ballot."
19728,1403058,5,anasanse,04/08/2021,"Second year that we repeat. Safe stop, with a grass soccer field next to it. Very quiet and with a supermarket and gas station next door. Free water change. Ideal if you go with a pet."
19728,1396111,5,ProSil,02/08/2021,"The best motorhome area there is. Everything very close, downtown Navia, beaches, etc. Free and many places. I give it an A grade."
19728,1384548,4,Grarober,31/07/2021,Very well located to visit the town and with a gas station and supermarket next door. A place to empty and fill waters. Very noisy because before 6 o'clock they were already unloading merchandise for the supermarket and the municipal cleaning service is also next door.
19728,1373764,4,Lafonteur69,28/07/2021,"Ample parking, very convenient access, very complete shopping center next to the parking area. Quite a lot of noise at dawn from trucks at gas station. Ideal to know the town. Very well located."
19728,1368839,5,JJunior,26/07/2021,Good place to spend the night and replenish food and gasoline. Also good service in the laundry € 4.5 wash and € 2 dryer.
19728,1361750,3,Antoniozafra,25/07/2021,"Water loading and unloading area, the tap is push-button and does not have a thread (this is for sewage) but there is a threaded socket on the top of the floor. There was 15 or 20 AC in the parking lot of the Eroski and no problem .. I suppose a good place to spend the night since we went to another place .. perfect to visit the town."
19728,1354976,5,gabrielebaumfalk,23/07/2021,"Very practical, at the Eroski and at a cheap gas station, supply, laundry everything in one place. Then there is the possibility to visit the beautiful place within walking distance."
19728,1314186,4,calichy,11/07/2021,"Village with many services and shops. Parking right next to supermarket. Quiet night. We have parked in the supermarket area. Beach 20 minutes walk. Very beautiful lighthouse area, the pity is that there is a sign not to stop or park or spend the night acs, vans, or vans. Emptying services. Garbage can next door."
19728,1313526,3,Jedoto,11/07/2021,"The area for motorhome parking is 8 places. The rest is the supermarket parking lot. Regarding the services, it has drainage of gray and black water but the filling tap is a push-button socket and does not have an adapter for hoses, so a lot of water is lost and makes filling difficult."
19728,1309555,4,sebas49,09/07/2021,"Pretty village. I do not understand that someone says that it is ugly. Nice walk to the beach. The area is fine to sleep, we were about five ac. We refuel local products at the Eroski."

19728,1178429,3,Miriamjg,24/04/2021,"The area itself is small. The rest of the spaces belong to the supermarket parking lot, but no one has made a problem for us. There is a school next door but when we spend the night on the weekend we do not feel any noise, the area is quiet. From Monday to Saturday the supermarket restrooms are available within their opening hours. There is a cafeteria in the supermarket itself"
19728,1173918,1,currodanaonboard,15/04/2021,"To spend an emergency night is worth but nothing more. School next door, supermarket and a lot of traffic. It hardly rests. It is appreciated to have points for motorhomes but in this case we sign it up for sporadic stops."
19728,1166572,5,SergioAsturias,04/04/2021,"Very good, we have spent Easter in this area and perfect. Quiet at night, there is a beautiful walk by the sea. Supermarket next door. There is a small playground next to it as well and nearby a pond with ducks and other things for the children. Loading and unloading area in perfect condition, the clean water intake is on the ground, it has a ""fat"" thread. Thanks to the Navia town hall."
19728,1148611,4,jasegurola,07/03/2021,"You can stay overnight in the attached car park. It is recommended to park away from the Familia supermarket, since trucks are unloaded in the mornings. Otherwise well."

19728,1036963,3,educaatuperro,09/09/2020,"It is a highly recommended area, but more the beach area where everything is shaded and a wonderful pine forest, bars etc, we will return with more days"

19728,960010,4,Furgo2020,13/08/2020,Perfect for a quiet night. Next to a supermarket with a cafeteria to have breakfast and go to the bathroom whoever needs it. A 10 minute walk in a pleasant walk to the center of the town where you find many restaurants to eat. Recommendable.
19728,944256,5,Txekio,09/08/2020,"AC area with gray and black cast. In principle, the AC car parks are in front of the dump area, not in the Eroski car park, but there are so many of us that the police allow it, I don't know if we would be at least 40 between vans and others. Very quiet to sleep. Without a shadow."

19728,754972,3,mleniaert,19/12/2019,Ideal for services but less pleasant to spend the night there because no parking spaces reserved for Camping Car. We only did the services. Recommend for services

19728,372938,1,sofnay,14/09/2018,"One of the worst places I've slept. At 4.30 trucks started arriving making a lot of noise. They use the ac car park to unload things at the supermarket in front of them. They have to maneuver and they pass several times and stop a few meters away. They were 40min, enough to have a hard time and wake up. In the town, the paper mill pollutes air and flows 6 times more than what is allowed by the who."

There was room for about 8 motor homes and I reckon no one minded about the three on the supermarket car park (clean toilets upstairs in the shop) 
Nice specialty cider bar called el chignio."

Caution: German translation problematic: if you want to pay, you have to choose ""Quit"". Only then will you be forwarded to the payment system. We chose ""continue"" and paid twice for it. there is room for improvement !!"

19922,2996260,5,jyepes1,21/07/2023,"I cant talk about the grey water and yes the toilets are still locked (you can drive 1 min or walk to the castle to an unlocked one) but this is an amazing stop and the only place you can legally sleep around as this is part of a national park. Marvao is a phenomenal place and the combination with the river beach at Portaguem makes it the perfect day trip, if not a longer one. Super recommended."
19922,2975143,5,rg12,16/07/2023,"Parking with a magnificent view of the valley, calm and relaxing. Water point only."

19922,2875022,5,joiedevivre,20/06/2023,"pity that it is a bit in poor condition for the passenger of motorhomes. A nice view. The castle is worth a visit, it is magnificent and in a good state of preservation. The view of the area is great. The village is very beautiful to visit. a good little CASA DO POVO restaurant. Traditional Portuguese cuisine and very good. it is worth the visit"
19922,2873430,5,thecat62,20/06/2023,Nice slot with great views. The castle is well worth seeing and there are good restaurants. Many thanks to the community for this great place!
19922,2858903,3,Nikoulen,16/06/2023,Small pleasant area. beautiful panorama. picnic tables. under the beautiful city. shims mandatory. watch out for gray water in the bucket. WC closed. a sink for free water. very quiet and under the trees. I recommend.
19922,2855954,2,RamonFdez.,15/06/2023,"Well thought-out site, except for one thing, it has shade, tables to eat, sink, toilets, black drain and drinking water, but the gray drain does not go to the sewer, if you empty the gray ones, due to the inclination, the water with detergent goes to the mountain The City Council should put a solution to this problem, they put emptying of gray and we leave without being able to empty."
19922,2849247,4,FRANDOM02,13/06/2023,"thank you to the municipality for making a place with a magnificent view available for the CCs, but maintenance of the services would be a plus village and castle to do absolutely"
19922,2833766,1,BichoTuga,08/06/2023,"Beautiful place, 5 star village, but closed toilets, closed water for cleaning evictions, filthy garbage containers. Drinking water only in the external sink for washing dishes and with a faulty faucet with wasted water. A feather."
19922,2808016,5,Baz,01/06/2023,"Perfect area with about ten seats. Water. Just below Marvao, a small fortified town that you absolutely must visit! Do not try to ride a motorhome to Marvao, the alleys are very narrow."
19922,2755134,4,hanslily,16/05/2023,"Fantastic view over the plain north of Marvao. Simple but precisely because of that nice camper place. We arrived at 4:30 PM. An hour later, all seats were taken. From the motorhome you can walk well and explore the village (short steep climb)."
19922,2711335,4,davas,30/04/2023,"When we went there were few holes and we had to sleep with some inclination. The restrooms were closed at the time. Despite that, the views upon waking up were spectacular. The town of Marvao is also beautiful, highly recommended."

19922,2683274,5,JoaoRibeiro,20/04/2023,"Great spot to spend the night, great view.
With bathroom and water supply, although you need to get there early or you find it hard to have a parking spot"
19922,2675689,4,Tutkom,16/04/2023,Parking-Sloping and uneven.Services-freshwater tap without a thread so a hose can’t be connected.Black water and grey water go to the same sump so it does not matter where you dump your toilet.Bring your pliers for the tap to wash the area.The drain is awkwardly behind a toilet so it is very hard to manoeuvre there.Apart from that the parking is stunning and the town well worth the visit.
19922,2660940,4,ThomasB86,11/04/2023,"Conform to the description: superb view, quiet location and for the brave a few strides from the city. Location not flat at all but access to drinking water and black water drainage. closed toilets"
19922,2657669,5,simidenny,10/04/2023,gigantic view! Great location. since we find it negligible that there is no shower or the toilets are closed.
19922,2639484,3,travelwithrotti,04/04/2023,"The place itself is very crooked. Very narrow plots plus trees (no satellite reception possible, no solar yield). Water impossible to connect a hose. A pity ! The view is breathtaking in the immediate area."

19922,2610566,4,shadowz,15/03/2023,Well worth the drive to get there.  Stunning village with 360 views from the very top.  Parking spaces felt a little too close to each other and ground a little rough/uneven.  Had to use container for water.
19922,2607887,3,ElVeterano,13/03/2023,"Absolutely no problem driving up to this one and even beyond the aire if you wish (there is some parking just around the next corner) so long as you stay on the N359. The ground is very sloping and it is impossible to get anything like level on most of the spaces. Water and disposal available, completely full last night, but great views and very well restored castle. Most restaurants closed."
19922,2607622,2,diego66,12/03/2023,"Enchanting view and beautiful landscapes. The parking spaces though are pretty awful! The slope is vertiginous and the terrain very rough. The services are non-existent, except for the emptying of sewage. Too bad that such a nice country offers such a poor space to its many visitors. It can fit just for one night."
19922,2602075,4,spoony03,07/03/2023,"Nice car park, very quiet and well located. good starting point to visit this beautiful village very well maintained. the castle is in very good condition. The view from the towers is absolutely sublime. the weather being still cool at night, we chose to go down to the valley to sleep. but in the summer we would have happily stayed. thank you to the town hall for their good work."
19922,2596185,5,dorsetian,02/03/2023,"Fabulous views, lovely village and very interesting castle. What more can you want for free? Yes it slopes and services could be better but just  prepare your service needs beforehand and go and enjoy the peace and the panoramic view. We loved it, although there were only 3 vans when we stayed and it might get a bit cramped if full."
19922,2578027,4,walsch,14/02/2023,it is no problem at all to reach the site with a camper van of 7.50 m length. you do need wedges though. Mobile communications are good and so is the view.
19922,2571615,3,Mawasko,08/02/2023,I don't know which road Misslilly came from but there are no accessibility concerns (I have a 7.5m) on the other hand to leave my GPS took me through a road where I had some fears . A word of advice only take the main road to get there and leave. Parking actually sloping but perfect for visiting the city and quiet.
19922,2571317,1,MissLily,07/02/2023,Absolutely impossible to reach with anything else than Van. Had to turn around in a sloping very narrow right hand turn.

19922,2560249,4,anna58,25/01/2023,"Area in need of maintenance. There is no gray water discharge, a tong is needed to load the water, the ground is uneven and not levelled. However, the place is absolutely worth the stop."
19922,2548192,4,MaxGemperle,10/01/2023,"Quiet place. Unfortunately, good pliers are needed for the faucet. In the service house he has some accessible sockets, but they are switched off. Unfortunately, the drinking water tap is the ""popular"" trigger for campers. A screw cap for a hose would be useful as well. The wonderful village of course makes up for these shortcomings. Hence my many stars."
19922,2537274,4,maisaki,01/01/2023,It is good to spend the night and visit Marvao.

19922,2221090,3,206nanocamper,12/08/2022,"Quiet night, quiet place. The WC was closed the night we stayed overnight - there is one further up next to the castle entrance. It has running drinking water. It's something uneven in some plots. It has superb views and shade. Lovely land. The Castle was open at night. Fantastic! Thank you Marvão."

19922,1980123,5,BDJ,15/06/2022,Perfect for visiting the village and its castle. The emptying of gray water is done without problem with the seal in the receptacle of black water.

19922,1962342,3,Toja22,09/06/2022,"I give 3 stars because you cannot empty the grey water so this area is pretty useless for us. However,the spot is amazing: great view,5minutes from the lovely village (I do recommend the castle!),quiet,clean,picnic tables,toilets,recycling bins,a sink,black water,free water next to the church a bit above the area. Levellers absolutely needed.
It is really a shame it does not have grey water area!"
19922,1952430,4,HetzmannJean,06/06/2022,impeccable to visit beautiful sloping view you need the wedges thank you to the municipality

19922,1898875,5,biaboga,18/05/2022,"Access to the village, always follow the main road, the GPS will take you through difficult shortcuts. The village and the views of the castle, it is worth going up. ok, but a little sloping, we parked a little more in vain under some oaks."
19922,1897453,3,marion.zuko,18/05/2022,"indeed free parking, very steep you have to put calle, possibility to empty cassette, no water with hose because just a tap has a sink, impeccable location to visit the castle which is very beautiful."
19922,1882519,5,catetphiphi50,10/05/2022,"thank you to the municipality for this free area. great place to visit this village and its castle and a quiet night with a beautiful panorama, no worries about emptying and refilling water as soon as you are equipped with a folding bucket for your waste water and a watering can for the clean water tank so from inappropriate comments"
19922,1873111,2,Kazabird1,06/05/2022,"lovely view and great for visiting the castle which is amazing.
however, pitches very narrow, toilets locked, bins overflowing, no grey waste and not tap connection for water fill. 
would not bother again now we've visited the castle."
19922,1845961,3,MC4333,22/04/2022,Thanks for the parking. It would be appreciated if it had a drain to empty gray water. The villa is spectacular and its views too

19922,1812738,5,mudakonn,09/04/2022,"Wonderful landscape views and quick access to the beautiful town. Toilets are closed and there is no grey water disposal. Place may be windy at night and make sure you have something to level your van as the ground surface is uneven. If you want to eat in town I highly recommend Natural Bar which has tasty sandwiches, salads and soups."
19922,1812367,3,Alzu,09/04/2022,"The squares a little tight and inclined, it is necessary to use shims. Curiously, it does not have a gray water emptying area. For the rest, the views are very good and very close to the town. That there continue to be towns with these initiatives for this type of tourism, which also counts and leaves money wherever it goes."
19922,1810991,3,Mmmoustic,08/04/2022,"Pretty village, the castle is wonderfully maintained. Beautiful views from all sides. The area has flat seats. Water tap without thread and a large block (wc) blocks access to the service area. Worth the trip. Very easy to access."
19922,1791110,5,PacoSampedro,22/03/2022,Thanks to the community for making it easy for us to stay in this beautiful area. It even has toilets and a sink to wash. Magnificent views. Very good .

19922,1779472,4,samsimillia,10/03/2022,Fabulous location and a great town and castle to visit. There are public toilets in the town that are open even though the portable ones at the aire are closed for winter. The only downside is it is not very level!
19922,1775930,3,traceyholmes,06/03/2022,Lovely location. Currently the portable water supply is being used for porta toilets that are locked although the washing up sink still has water and there is toilet emptying facilities. No grey water drain that we could see. Fabulous views across to Spain with the fortified town above.
19922,1764013,4,ErikZindel,23/02/2022,"beautiful view! Quite slanted, even with our leveling feet not level. No satellite TV possible, but with that view .... The places are very narrow.

19922,1728650,3,sjors51,07/01/2022,Nice view but very skewed positions. Toilets were closed. Water only at tap of sooet sink. Not suitable for hose connection. Very muddy which makes getting stuck in bad weather. Village is beautiful.
19922,1724111,2,LRamos,02/01/2022,"Place with magnificent view, but currently ASA is without any care (aspect of abandonment), with the eviction site occupied by a pre-fabricated structure (there is no grid on the ground, with only water for supply (in a tap without thread in a washbasin). of crockery)."
19922,1718687,3,Aventuramenuda,29/12/2021,"A spectacular location, with some unevenness, which can be solved with the chocks. Very quiet night.

Thank you to the village for this place"
19922,1701636,4,rudi.ratlos,02/12/2021,"We stood here for one night, would have stayed longer if it hadn't been for the storm. There are sockets, but they are switched off. The toilets are also locked. Presumably the keys are available from the local tourist information office. The terrain has a steep gradient, you need high wedges or jacks to stand straight. We would love to come back."
19922,1689953,5,Bassiebal,15/11/2021,Place with beautiful view! There is a new sign at the entrance that says you can stay for 72 hours. Overnight stay is therefore allowed.
19922,1683881,4,jap1991,10/11/2021,"FANTASTIC LANDSCAPE. Pros: Amazing scenery, lots of space, proximity to castle. Cons: the water source didn't have a hose (I couldn't fill the tank), the floor was very uneven."
19922,1673872,4,NaribS,01/11/2021,"Parking area for motorhomes just at the foot of the castle. Very beautiful view. And also a quiet place. Access to a water point for recharging.

19922,1661475,4,Iggylux,25/10/2021,"Beautiful view, nice village and a very nice walk in the forest. Water is running, toilets are closed and I think it's allowed to stay, a sign says CC. Only problem is that you're very close to each other."

19922,1508434,1,MarcoPVaz,24/08/2021,"Wing discontinued, services are off. The sign at the entrance says service area and overnight stay, but according to the Tourism Office they indicate that it is not even possible to stay overnight... Basically, the location is poorly informed and no one is interested in updating the location."
19922,1426481,4,FrancescMR,09/08/2021,"The leveling of the land is a problem in some places, if you do not place the chocks ... The situation is perfect to visit this beautiful town. The visits from the parking spaces are excellent. Clean and black water services, but there is no gray drainage."

19922,1268338,4,faurys93,21/06/2021,"Below the very pretty village, about 10 minutes (it climbs steeply) from the center. On the other hand, nothing for gray water. Black water and filling OK but complex to position the cc."
19922,1243225,3,AnaSantos,08/06/2021,Nice place to stay to visit the castle and city. Quiet and clean. Has place to empty black waters and to fill clean water but not to empty grey waters. That's the reason I only give 3 stars.
19922,1212188,5,jonn,23/05/2021,"You can spend the night without problem, the town and its castle are well worth a visit. It can be said that it is a motorhome area given its enabled services and that is how the signs mark it."

The entrance photo which indicates the possibility of parking and making black and gray water. However, the previous comments invited us to look for the indication of no parking at night. There is at the end of the car park to the right of the staircase leading to the convent. This sign is overwritten, redacted and almost illegible. To see the photo! I stayed. I had already passed at the same time in 2016, there were about fifteen CCs! COVID has been there!"

19922,656163,4,theroverlanders,24/08/2019,Stayed here one night and it was lovely and quiet as well as dark and cool. The tap works and we had no bother from anyone. We stayed with another two motorhomes and it’s a great place to wander up into the village.

19922,530095,1,76ronchon,27/06/2019,"Lamentable. Nothing exists for emptying, water. The village is perhaps very beautiful, we do not know, the weather was very bad. No luck decidedly."

19922,494094,4,Papagomas,27/05/2019,Area with water service in a privileged enclave. We overnight without problem during the week and together with other 3 AC. In most places the chocks are necessary.
19922,480247,2,Chrisandliz,09/05/2019,Good parking location to see beautiful Marvao but there is a tiny sign that declares there is a fine of up to €200 for “camping behaviour” including overnight. The local police say that they have no problem but local campsite owners don’t like motorhomes staying overnight here and are putting pressure on. So we left very disappointed as we had hoped to stay and hike the area. Instead we found a free stopover to avoid paying the campsites that are making it difficult here. Look elsewhere if you want to stay the night.
19922,479359,3,pticlod,08/05/2019,"Good to visit the city and the beautiful castle very well maintained. We can drain the black water, but there is only a tap of water on a sink. From what we understand the owners of the campgrounds in the area are putting pressure so that the gnr does not let us spend the night. The fine of € 200 dissuaded us, but we will not give our money to the campsite. We go further, where there is a good reception."
19922,456888,4,miicoo,17/04/2019,"What a beautiful town, also well worth the 1,50€ for the castle.
the spot has nice views, facilities are ok but a bit run down. in the far end is a tiny sign that forbids staying overnight, but all did with no problem. only has 10 ""official"" parkings. I think this might be the main reason for restrictions if in high season many campers try to squeeze in somehow and then causing overflow   trouble"
19922,450107,3,Brunnenkuh,07/04/2019,"There were 6 campers overnight, in a place with great views and close to the city wall. Disposal station available but old.

19922,411467,3,luifer,02/12/2018,"Effectively put a sign that can not be overnight, the tourism office told me that the owner of the camp has been the one that has moved the threads so you can not stay overnight."
19922,409454,3,jpastor,22/11/2018,Well indicated on the road access to the town. You can evacuate waters. I'm a bit inclined. The area signal crossed out sloppily. Perfect location to visit a beautiful town. No problem.

19922,265061,4,Rond58,07/06/2018,A lovely  place to have a picnic and enjoy the day walking around the beautiful town.  A bit steep getting there but nothing scary at all.  I imagine  the rain and mist may have an affect but this is an absolute  visit town.  Overnight stays may result in a fine as per notice board.  We moved on but where grateful for the opportunity  to stop and enjoy.

Easy access and beautiful view from this eagle's nest. At the foot of the magnificent village and castle. Warning: Do not let the GPS (Waze) take you to Escusa, a camper does not go through the very tight streets of the village."
19922,201175,1,JeanLuc9,08/10/2017,"I studied this, Really you're right on the road. Camping, so the night in public road is prohibited in Portugal. Legal Decree 310/2002 - Article 47, paragraph G: Camping without a license has a fine of 150 to 200 euros. I do not think it's easier to understand. Fortunately Marvao and Castelo de Vide knows 4 campsites in the immediate area."
19922,171986,1,chewy,11/08/2017,First motorhome area prohibited at night. The reason is that the owner of the neighboring campsite finds that his campsite is not full enough. Lamentable. The GNR goes from time to time and hop. The emptying area is no longer maintained. Same reasoning at the parking of the Pools of Portagem. Go camping! Otherwise village postcard but purely tourist. Very disappointing from the municipality of Marvão.
19922,152389,3,Mamen8cc,16/07/2017,Nice place to spend the night since you see everything Marvao from above and illuminated. Quiet and accessible.

Location beautiful village but we had to cut short our visit because the village was invaded by clouds of flying ears claw. It was swarming on the floor and the walls of the houses it's amazing.

19929,1919567,4,pam00,27/05/2022,"Cozy place with magnificent views. The only thing is that there are no rubbish bins, it is not very practical to go to the landfill to throw the rubbish."
19929,1892045,4,indalia,15/05/2022,"We stopped for a while to eat because we were passing through, we saw it well, very good views, we were alone. There are no bins, just a full bin. The emptying of black comes out from below, it has to be fixed, otherwise fine"

19929,1444227,4,judan,12/08/2021,"Well-appointed space. Beautiful views. Thank you, the municipality. The only problem is a small isolated corner next to the building opposite where young people come to smoke joints with loud music and the noises that go with their condition until late at night."
19929,1390819,2,jordibella,01/08/2021,"A little left, you need to prune the trees as the branches touch the cars. rubbish on the floor so that there is only a bin., it is necessary to leave containers for recycling. the cries of the slaughtered pigs are heard in the slaughterhouse."

The very small and cramped area, the dump point blocked by a parked car. Inadvisable. We didn't even stay to eat."
19929,1265728,2,juncalmontero,20/06/2021,"The area is correct, with basic water services (prepaid) and emptied. No light. At night, the pool next door was very noisy. A caravan, without staying overnight that did not even get in and stayed at the entrance, without taking off from the car, speakers on the roof with very loud music and bottle, until 4 o'clock at night. She was the beverage supplier."

The young men came and said it was not the first time it had happened .... I do not recommend this place at all."
19929,836771,4,adelalre,26/06/2020,"The area is well leveled, well located, next to the municipal swimming pool, close to the village. Good sights. Because they do the door-to-door garbage collection, the garbage there was full. It smells peculiar to be next to the slaughterhouse and makes a continuous noise but it did not bother us to sleep."
19929,832547,4,notenemosfrontera,22/06/2020,"Well located area near the town and with very good visits. Wide to go with AC and easy access. As unique but the water recharge service does not work, if to clean WC."

Nice views, near the center of Avignon. The only thing: there is no light service and it is next to the biomass plant that serves the school, kindergarten and sports complex, noisy during the day and maybe at night it can be annoying, I do not know since we have spent the night."
19929,781321,4,quatreenfurgo,16/02/2020,Very quiet and clean site. It is very close to the town walking. Also nearby there is a children's park and some geocaching. He is touching the field and excursions can be made. There is drinking water for € 1 and the possibility of draining water.
19929,778854,3,ludewe,11/02/2020,"CP with nice view, nicely laid out and equipped with a column with water, electricity, possibilities for gray water and toilet ... fine. But ... the smell is definitely not nice: biomass company, butchery ... perhaps not unhealthy, but with an overnight stay with such a beautiful view you imagine something else."

19929,491269,3,avera,24/05/2019,"Nice quiet area, overlooking the fields, well placed near the city center (good restaurant ""Fabrik"" at 500 m, server and nice atmosphere). Slaughterhouses not perceptible at our arrival, but sweetish and nauseating smell impregnated the atmosphere of 18h). On sunny days, windows open and wind orientation, it must be unbearable. Privilege then area next to the stream."
19929,450058,4,Monicandreu,07/04/2019,"Very quiet, with cows in the land next to it, great for children."

19929,374698,1,montse66,16/09/2018,"We spent tonight, the place is beautiful but they were parties and we had music all night that stopped at 4 in the morning and started again at 6.26 a.m. until 9 in the morning. I understand that there are parties but normally the city councils give permission until 3 or 4 in the morning, incredible that here lasts all night, therefore impossible to sleep, now they have left a trace of pork."
19929,366228,3,manoloviladecans,06/09/2018,By God as there can be so many flies the site in very quiet and shaded but the bad smell and flies are a problem

The bakery at 5 min has some fabulous breads and sweets, also wines and jams. The sunset view is beautiful. The pool costs 5 euros adults and 3 euros children and quite large with lawn. Filling and emptying very comfortable."
19929,262654,5,anpuga,02/06/2018,"Very quiet area to spend a weekend and hiking. Shops nearby (grocery store, butchery, supermarket) to spend and thank the people who have thought of us."
19929,248059,4,padraigl,07/05/2018,"Flat sandy parking. Nice view over the gorge. Close to shops. 
Plenty of long trail walks in the hills which are not marked. Maps.me is the best app for the trails as Google maps does not show them all. The tourist information maps are not great.
Services are good and clean.
In the evening people bring their dogs here and let them run on their own. Also can hear the abattoir in evening."
19929,245070,4,laurent29,02/05/2018,"To be calm it's really calm. A flat, this is the place where all the people of the village come to do the poop to their dogs without of course pick it up after."

19929,217899,3,Rootsboy,06/01/2018,"Good but there was a strong smell of scrubbing at first, after the machine next to it stopped."
19929,182549,2,nejo,22/08/2017,"As a positive point: good shadows and the municipal pools next door. As a weak point (for us important) to mention that from 4:00 to 2:00 (if 22h a day) you can hear the cries of animals in the slaughterhouse of Avinyo, especially at night. A pity, otherwise it would be 10!"
19929,175779,4,Alkon,15/08/2017,"Good area for spending the night, work, water for € 1 50l and free to clear gray and black water. Tables for picnic and near the village and right next to the pools. Mountain views."

19934,2449833,5,reseda,18/10/2022,We rented an apartment in Barcelona to spend a month in Barcelona. During this time we looked for and found a safe and guarded parking space for our mobile home. We paid 100€ for the month. I would not recommend this place as a place to stay overnight.
19934,2416832,1,sophilou,01/10/2022,"That was the worst and worst thing I had to experience as a camper in all my years, unfriendly and the place was the worst. It is a parking space for old, disused campers and winter storage. Any parking lot is better. Please NEVER drive away, too bad about the diesel. Pure rip off!"
19934,2305843,5,Rollerteam77,26/08/2022,"Camper area with all services available, loading and unloading and electricity included in the price of 15 €. The spaces are not large but the manager gives you the opportunity to pull out the table and chairs if possible. Pay attention to the bus tickets if you want to visit Barcelona, if you can pass by a metro station before going to the camper area and buy the family zone 2."
19934,2293756,4,idealman,24/08/2022,"Welcomed by the very nice person who manages for us. Quiet area, fenced parking lot under surveillance camera. The pitches on the other hand are very limited 50 cm which separates me from the next door neighbor, everything is concreted on the ground. New emptying system for cassettes, gray water, possibility of cleaning motorhomes with platform for roofs and tire inflation super ??"
19934,2223315,4,Paso,12/08/2022,"Very practical for visiting Barcelona, because all campsites are full and very expensive!! Here 15 € with Elec, a little noisy in the morning. the Mr at the reception is nice and gave us good information to take the bus to Barcelona, Sagales E7 bus stop Sagrera 3.5€/pers (attn 1 bus faster than the other 30mn or 1h! in the evening take 7:40 p.m. because afterwards it's long) then Metro take Ticket 8trajets 10€"
19934,2145313,2,GiulaRnR,30/07/2022,"Tight parking, almost unable to open the door. The person who greeted us told us a price, the person at check out another price, obviously higher, without hearing reasons. They don't have ATMs. There is a bathroom (toilet) for everyone. The country does not offer much, but by bike there is a place to have dinner or to buy something."
19934,2124909,4,dosyk,26/07/2022,"Good parking, monitored, a perfect stop for visiting Barcelona, buses 200m from the parking lot, all services."
19934,2123875,5,SaraCrespo,25/07/2022,"The best thing is the security that they give you that the Motorhome will always be watched. We went to Barcelona by bus, and then we moved there by metro and bus, buying family passes for 3 zones in the metro, to be able to return by bus you need to be from 3 zones. Ricardo, the security guard was the best, friendly and helped us with everything we needed."

19934,1708263,1,MichelPoulain,11/12/2021,"supervised area the only positive point. Cash payment requested of 20 euros without electricity, avoid this area which is a guarding of motorhomes. There is another one not far away with all the services at 10 euros."
19934,1694527,5,mamenurti,21/11/2021,"Nice? No, but since we spent our days in Barcelona and only came to sleep, it was not the goal. It is a place where the locals keep their caravans and motorhomes, but it has a great advantage that made me decide to come. It is guarded 24 hours and perfectly communicated with Barcelona by bus. I will be back!"
19934,1650961,3,konny13,18/10/2021,"Actually a year-round parking space for motor home owners. The supply and disposal is quite new. Maneuvering room a bit cramped. When traveling with a team we should pay for WoWa as well as for the car, but was accepted as an exception. Advantage, you are quite close to Barcelona. Bus line is approx. 350m from the square. After many other places around Barcelona are rated as not safe."
19934,849780,4,Camioncar,05/07/2020,"Perfect for visiting Barcelona, not too charming place, storage for motorhomes, but not too many mosquitoes or flies, and you can recharge with water, gray water, empty the cassette, plus you have electricity, and a place for tinkering (no oil change or engine repair)"

19934,749104,5,mickstrick1,01/12/2019,"Not a pretty place at all, more like a storage area for campers. But still would recommend this as a place to stay due to its safety. 
Guys running the place are very friendly and helpful. Bus to Barce is a 10 min walk from the gates. Be careful you don't miss the last bus back out to your camper!! We nearly did. ?"
19934,741553,5,nbarr17,11/11/2019,If you come to Barcelona this is the only place I recommend staying. The only downfall in terms of amenities is the lack of toilets and showers. Otherwise it is safe! Money well spent. Bus extremely close to take you to the heart of Barcelona. The staff member we interacted most with was professional and helpful.
19934,726586,4,TA12,21/10/2019,"Good safe parking and amenities.  Easy 45 min bus ride into Barcelona. Then swap to metro.  10 trip ticket good but €10.20 price only covers zone 1,  parking is outside this.. Quiet at night.  Friendly helpful staff."

19934,262729,4,arlo,02/06/2018,"Very convenient to visit Barcelona. Bus nearby, but it is better to buy the card of 10 trips to 10,20 € than to take the tickets to the driver who are 4.1 € the unit. These cards can be bought in all metro stations (they are valid for the bus, the metro etc ...)."
19934,205462,2,Sebas09,23/10/2017,A little expensive anyway ...
19934,183666,5,montez,24/08/2017,"After spending the night and check the conditions, I have to change to 5 stars, the place is guarded 24 hours by surveillance cameras and has 24 hour guard, water, dirty water and chemical and electricity dump for € 15. For me, I consider it very good."
19934,183262,3,montez,23/08/2017,"It is not a motorhome area but it accepts motorhomes for overnight stay, the space is fenced and has 24 hour guard, has no bathroom, but has electricity, water and dirty water disposal, the price is 15 euros 24 hours. It is close to the motorway to Barcelona."

19934,75541,5,monika1744,04/06/2016,"We are very satisfied with this area. It is located near buses to visit Barcelona. She is clean and very well supervised. The guard is present 24 hours a day. Grids are permanently closed but no waiting to enter. The last bus leaving from Barcelona is at 22:25, so you can stay late in the city. Really very very good."
19934,54472,1,itineo,10/09/2015,"No possibility of draining the black and gray water, or fill up with drinking water if you do not stay sleeping on the spot. No place, go your way. A star because we can not put zero."
19934,47054,5,UweDietrich,07/08/2015,Good place for the night. With security guard and guard dog and power supply.
19934,31611,5,javatorr,28/02/2015,"Correct service and attention, vigilante 24h. Secluded and quiet place. Electricity included in the price. Service et des soins appropriés, gardien 24h. Isolé et calme. Electricité inclus dans le prix."
19958,3117217,5,Thorwald1963,10/08/2023,Super cool camping park. The food is really delicious. Had a little chat with the place. Will stop again on the way back.
19958,2942436,2,Jorgeg151,09/07/2023,We are new to the world of camper vans and the attention they have given us has been lousy and unkind. As we understood the site is only for clients and they did not let us refill water.
19958,2773441,5,Gironemo,21/05/2023,Great place with a great restaurant I can agree with previous speakers
19958,2686693,5,Womoleben,21/04/2023,"Very nice groundskeeper who has a plan of how the Womos have to be positioned so that everyone has a place and can get out again. Welcomes you as soon as you arrive and explains everything and has tips for the further journey. Food was delicious, owners were very nice and attentive."
19958,2672289,1,Krambambuli,15/04/2023,"Tip for dog owners: If you leave the SP through the small side gate, there is a fenced-in dog run opposite. With garbage container in front of it, but no bag dispenser"
19958,2667340,5,die2,13/04/2023,Stopped here on the return trip. The groundskeeper gave us a very friendly briefing. Everything is available what the camper needs and everything is clean. The food in the restaurant was very tasty. We will definitely come back here on our next trip to Spain. Parking fee (for consumption over 35 euros) 5 euros
19958,2661585,5,alexp1963,11/04/2023,"1A place for transit! Very nicely laid out, you can also spend the night with large mobile homes and teams. Regarding the ""groundsman"": I think it's great that someone here makes sure that people stand in an orderly manner. If you react to it normally, he is friendly and helpful. He even helped us to park the team backwards by getting behind the wheel himself."
19958,2647080,1,GabrieleEsper,07/04/2023,"As soon as I arrived, a man came towards me waving his hands and said I had to stand on the other side. So I backed up to the other side, followed by the groundsman. Determined, he said he would help me. I politely replied that I didn't need any help. Then he: HE WOULD BE THE MAINTENANCE HERE, AND WHAT HE SAYS WILL BE DONE! I drove away 0⭐️"
19958,2625892,5,nudelgeniesserle,26/03/2023,"Nice restaurant in Planes del Regne, Spaetzle Fritz, San Rafael del Rio. Very nice reception from the groundskeeper and friendly instruction on the pitch. Electricity, water and disposal all available. To the local: Super food with good wines at reasonable prices! Friendly staff and fun to deal with."
19958,2619402,2,haexli2,22/03/2023,"No, we no longer have to. The instructor behaves arrogantly and thinks only he knows how to drive. When I wanted to show my husband the distance, he said: I'm the only one to show you the way, otherwise you can go again! Waited 30 minutes in the restaurant for the order, with a few guests at 5 p.m"
19958,2602915,4,th66jh,08/03/2023,"Pitch neat and clean. Table and chairs still fit on the plot. If you stand near the road, the traffic noise is considerable. The restaurant service is nice and friendly, the food is good and plentiful (mostly German cuisine, we missed Balkans)."
19958,2590558,5,marc1952,25/02/2023,".... we were often on the pitch and for us the security and an undisturbed sleep is worth the price. I can't say anything about the negative evaluation, because we basically use our showers in the World Cup. Without exception, the restaurant has promised us well and has a comprehensive and rich selection. We always like to come back to this place when passing through..."
19958,2580952,2,mesnil,17/02/2023,"bjr, the parking area is really good (clean, pleasant), even if we realize that Germans are welcome..!!!!! we would gladly do without this "" usher "" who tries to make his law ... he does not even listen to our request .!!! pity that access to the showers is not free. the cc drain is closed??? and the pompom, cash payment required....why? ."
19958,2578985,5,womoulmi,15/02/2023,"By chance we became aware of the Spaetzle Fritz. As it fit into our itinerary we stopped here for one night. We were kindly assigned a place with many other mobile homes, completely ok for a pitch. We also ate in the restaurant, it was very good. Thanks for the possibility to park safely for 5€ one night."
19958,2570915,4,Harleydriver,07/02/2023,"Everything fitted. Yes, the price is always a matter of opinion. Wasn't cheap but reasonable for the place. Also space for larger mobile with trailer and the food was good and plentiful."
19958,2569246,5,Störti01,05/02/2023,Very friendly reception. The food was correct and sufficient. Very nice and courteous service. We'd love to come back when we're nearby.
19958,2568498,1,bdan11,04/02/2023,if you like to be tight as sardines come here on the other hand nice welcome we feel that it's just for the money so we will not come back here and I will recommend it to anyone
19958,2567665,5,TTorkel,04/02/2023,"Friendly reception, well-divided parking space for large vehicles with trailers. Food was also very tasty and friendly staff in the restaurant. All in all was quite satisfactory. Got a baguette for breakfast without ordering. Can't understand the negative reviews. If you want original spaetzle, you should go on holiday to Swabia."
19958,2559769,5,HDharry1,24/01/2023,"I can't understand what people say. Shame on you. We found the SP very good. Everything very clean and working. The reception in the restaurant was very friendly and the food was absolutely good. Honestly, anyone who finds something to complain about here is probably dissatisfied with themselves."
19958,2555264,3,NiciundTobi,19/01/2023,"Pitch okay for one night, everything for campers available. Warmly welcomed by the groundskeeper. The food wasn't to my taste, the menu was way too big, less on the menu, subjective feeling. There was the possibility to order baguette for the next day, but I found it expensive at €2 for a crappy baguette. France baguette costs 1€ and tastes even better."
19958,2552612,4,berndlinke,15/01/2023,"Pitch great, were greeted friendly, restaurant is a matter of taste, cold atmosphere and food was ok!"
19958,2551280,2,MarKer,14/01/2023,Directly on a busy (truck) road!! Sanitary acceptable. No free choice of seat. cuddle camping. (Restaurant is NOT included in the rating.)
19958,2548578,1,Mitchell1995,10/01/2023,"We agree with the negative reviews. Food is expensive, people who don't belong together are simply seated together at a table. To the square, everyone is placed close together. Showers are a disaster for €2! Constantly too cold or too hot. You can't go for a walk with the dog here either, just a country road in front of the square. Bad WiFi"
19958,2528255,4,Bas-Ti,25/12/2022,"We cannot agree with the negative comments! The showers cost €2 pp BUT: we have a mobile home and it's hard to believe, but you can also shower in it ;) the food was great and the service was super nice! The groundskeeper makes it super comfortable to arrive here. The couple is doing this 'transitionally' and the way it calls into the forest, it echoes back again. We have had great experiences with both of them! The plots are a bit denser, but not too bad for us, since we were passing through anyway and for 1 night it's completely okay!"
19958,2520589,5,tisum2,12/12/2022,"Heard and seen a lot about it over the years. Now personally met. There's nothing to complain about. Were greeted very friendly and instructed. Dinner on site was excellent. If consumed, there is a discount on the space fee. Near the highway. Super milestone on the way south and back. We'll schedule it from now on. Thanks to everyone who makes it happen."
19958,2516634,4,baroudeur0108,08/12/2022,"Super, Very good place, very well received and eating well at the restaurant, we will be back!!!"
19958,2514345,3,Formentera,06/12/2022,"Were there for the first time on 11/13/22, we were satisfied. Overnight place with restaurant, completely without prejudice, the groundskeeper very friendly. We only have 1 star for the location, food 2-3, supply and disposal good. Very safe place. Even when it's raining you stand up. We'll be back as just a place to stay."
19958,2504042,5,racmac,23/11/2022,"Our experience, don't judge unfairly, we were kindly v. space received and got a quiet SP. Then off to eat in the garden at 22°, order tender veal escalope, fried potatoes, salad / cream spaetzle with roasted meat, salad, drinks and I'll tell you, that was the tastiest meal of the month. Tomorrow morning we'll get Bugget delivered by Ute that's service, we'll be back."
19958,2411762,5,Pele63,29/09/2022,Groundskeeper Günther and his hard-working wife are very friendly and do a great job! We were greeted warmly and shown to the pitch for two nights. The subsequent meal in the restaurant was delicious and inexpensive. The olives bought from you and the homemade jam are great!! The sometimes bad comments against the place are incomprehensible !!
19958,2388362,5,sam4711,20/09/2022,We stayed for one night on this beautiful pitch and were greeted very nicely by groundskeeper Günther. We'd love to come back!!
19958,2359842,5,AnselmoVC,11/09/2022,Full points. We were greeted by a super friendly groundskeeper who showed us around and explained where everything was to be found. It was a quiet and comfortable night. We had a delicious meal in the restaurant...
19958,2288511,5,tecnopedro24,23/08/2022,perfect to spend the night and continue traveling. 12 euros and 16 with electricity
19958,2165908,5,Dominik89,03/08/2022,Super delicious food. Nice and clean place.
19958,1932800,2,Yahal,30/05/2022,"Schnitzel for just under 20EUR from the deep fryer. To make matters worse, not even tasty. Service great. Unfortunately I didn't read the bad reviews beforehand. you agree."
19958,1896387,2,seelenverwandt,17/05/2022,"I can agree with all the negatives, good food is something else, gristly lamb, inflated prices for the services, you can tell that the founder is no longer alive - investment backlog, you live from the old good reputation, too bad"
19958,1847119,1,dicki1968,23/04/2022,"I agree with the negative comments. Restaurant prices overpriced. Value for money is not right at all. 2 dishes plus 2 drinks just under 45 EUR. Tasted ok but nothing more. Much too expensive by Spanish standards, but you can do it with the (mostly) Germans. You are standing on a loveless gravel parking lot on a noisy street. We won't be back."
19958,1838537,1,Jurek55,19/04/2022,"I can only confirm all the negative reviews. €4 extra for electricity at 6 A is outrageous. No receipt and only cash, probably because of ""tax optimization"""
19958,1834654,4,Albertcm23,18/04/2022,"We have slept one night. The area is fine, seats a bit fair and quite expensive but it gets you out of a hurry. €12 parking with services, €4 electricity, €2 shower. Includes Wi-Fi! It seems to be an area of some Germans focused on German customers, especially because it has a restaurant with mainly German food. We didn't have dinner there because we thought everything was very expensive and the reviews weren't good."
19958,1832016,1,Mobilmick,17/04/2022,"Unfortunately for us a wrong decision, we wanted to get to know it, but neither space nor food will cause us to come back. Value for money the worst of our trip. Too bad."
19958,1800836,1,Lepanto666,30/03/2022,"The pitch hell. Standing tightly together, completely overcrowded in March. We drove on immediately"
19958,1791841,1,richtolli,22/03/2022,"Standing in a row staggered by departure time; musty German groundskeeper; numbers without a receipt; Sales amount target in the very modest restaurant, so that the parking fee is cheaper; right on a main road. Greed for profit characterizes this place."
19958,1789293,3,megatruck,20/03/2022,"You can but you don't have to. The parking space is super clean, even for large campers, and easily accessible, but the food is average! We stayed because of the great food reviews - but were disappointed. The spaetzle, which was only available as a side dish anyway (no spaetzle dishes) were warmed up!"
19958,1785224,1,jkpoessel,16/03/2022,"Our camping neighbor recommended it to us, otherwise we wouldn't have thought of it... It was a wrong decision to go there, not even the spaetzle tasted good, schnitzel from the frying pan.... Completely incomprehensible why the parking space and restaurant are full. The prices have already been described elsewhere...Absolute rip-off!"
19958,1770140,1,Holger21,01/03/2022,"A toilet wing with three toilets for men and women together is an absolute no-go these days!!!!!! Long waiting time in the restaurant for a ""gourmet pot"" (which doesn't deserve the name at all). Shower for 2€ fits into the overall picture, pencil baguette 2€. So it is clear that the first visit was also the last at ""Spaetzle Fritz""!!!!!!!"
19958,1768831,1,Reiserebell,28/02/2022,"Despite a reservation, no parking space, got a seat in the restaurant. The food came quite quickly, schnitzel from the fryer, steak hard, spaetzle only tasted of flour. Price with 2 drinks from €49.80! Boss didn't want to listen to complaints. 2€ for a small baguette? Unfriendly response are not at Aldi. So beware of storms and wind and Germans who are abroad! Not recommended"
19958,1750942,2,AtatheHun,08/02/2022,"Earlier when we ate in the restaurant the parking was free.  in contrast, with a bill in the restaurant of 64 €, parking is already 5 €!  the saddest thing is to tell you this after dinner!  It doesn't have to ruin a good old place with such small things… ..12 € it's otherwise golden because it's in the middle of nowhere… ..and you have to pay for all other services (electricity, water, etc.)"
19958,1749939,4,UrSch58,07/02/2022,"An ideal place on the journey south or back, especially for large vehicles. The groundskeeper has an overview and assigns the seats, which is good. Everyone is very nice and the food is delicious."
19958,1745076,2,BRUNO83,31/01/2022,"Rather disappointed. Previously dining would waive the parking fee. Now, despite a meal at 64 euros, you have to pay an additional 5 euros. Very petty."
19958,1741433,4,Oldtom2005,26/01/2022,"Perfect stop, food very good, full service, fresh bread in the morning"
19958,1739350,5,Aviator,23/01/2022,Were there on 1/22/22. Super pitch and best food. All are friendly and helpful. We'll be back for sure.
19958,1737056,1,Carpediemx,19/01/2022,"Treated with fish in the face only for not having understood that there was no room, that then there were free pitches."
19958,1736598,5,NiBiWoMo,18/01/2022,But: The food is just delicious... The surroundings are perfect... Nice neighbors... Stand operators are also very nice... Completely satisfied!
19958,1727915,1,mupfl01,06/01/2022,"Part 1: cheese spaetzle was fabulous - red wine was also very nice !!!! boss - something of unfriendly !!!! Service - was nice but also probably stressed by the boss and not so friendly! gÜnter (groundsman) - it doesn't work at all, very impudent !!!!"
19958,1719700,3,-cw-,30/12/2021,"We have been here several times. We are currently hearing from various visitors who have been robbed. So watch out, lock doors and flaps"
19958,1710858,1,Krambambuli,16/12/2021,"The restaurant ... you can pick up food ... but: the staff and the boss are unfriendly to grumpy, although there was little rush, I had to wait endlessly in the overheated, musty, unventilated room that smelled unpleasantly of old cooking oil until I could order and pay. ..and then parking was not free, despite sufficient sales, but 6 euros were charged."
19958,1709990,5,flaquito,14/12/2021,Arrived here on Saturday with a broken tooth. The groundsman's wife put me in touch with a German dentist. I am saved. Everyone here is super friendly. I would love to come back.
19958,1705445,5,Mobby06,07/12/2021,Arrived at Spätzle Fritz today. We were welcomed very nicely by the groundskeeper. The groundskeeper saved me with a pack of cigarettes. The food in the restaurant was delicious. The staff were very nice and accommodating. We would love to come back. Greetings from the Saarlanders.
19958,1698929,1,Benjamin7777,27/11/2021,Part II: Immediately someone comes and says where you should stand. I think so. Totally disrespectful to newcomers. And to ask an extra € 2 for almost cold shower water is cheeky! I found it more than funny that I was served only Knöpfle instead of real spaetzle. - because of Swabia. haha. The pricing WITHOUT salad! Much too expensive. For me: NEVER AGAIN !!!! Grrrr ..
19958,1698916,1,Benjamin7777,27/11/2021,"Stayed one night wondering what people find in this place ??? Every 2nd class spanCP has better and warmer showers. The food well ....-. It wasn't spaetzle, it was knöpfle. Disappointing!. Price would be OK, i.e. too expensive WITHOUT salad. Soup was plenty and hot. What I got upset was that when you arrive you can't even orientate yourself and look around in peace. ONE comes immediately!"
19958,1698318,5,benji2021,26/11/2021,We were completely satisfied. Very nice people at the reception. Ute and Günther take very loving care of the campers. They try to fulfill every wish. Ute even printed out an entry form for France for us. Bread can be ordered and is delivered. Showers and toilets ok. The food in the restaurant is pretty German and very tasty. Everything ok in terms of price.
19958,1693819,5,AhyokaMaka,20/11/2021,"We were very satisfied with our stay and will definitely come back again. The people were all super nice! I say carefully ""how to call into the forest ..."";) Only in the restaurant they were just a little overwhelmed. But it was also overcrowded when we were there! Are all just human and do their best. See you soon! :)"
19958,1692649,4,haul,18/11/2021,"Very friendly and helpful reception by the groundskeeper and his wife! Highly frequented place because of cult status. Quiet in the back at night, showers getting on in years, the spaetzle very tasty. Nothing interesting in the area within walking distance - so only to stay overnight."
19958,1685801,5,Talent11,12/11/2021,"Where can you get that, to be received by Günther (the groundskeeper) at the entrance to the site, to be instructed and to be asked about the requirements for care. His wife Ute takes care of the baguettes for breakfast. Had technical problems that Günther solved in no time. The two do everything to make you feel good! What more do you want. Restaurant, V / E are ok. Come again!"
19958,1683525,1,leon08,09/11/2021,"To this day, always gladly and regularly drove to the square. But today we went on after 5 minutes. The new groundskeeper didn't need to scare us away any longer. Never met such a rude person. Schade were always happy to come. But from today we will avoid this place"
19958,1671727,1,galactica,31/10/2021,"Anyone who likes to be regulated has come to the right place. The would-be groundskeeper romps here and feels super important for the first time in life. Hence this hat. Otherwise everything is very German and if you need it, you are welcome to visit this place. If you like Spain, you should drive around this square."
19958,1670897,1,KindlerEdouard,31/10/2021,Unfriendly German janitor character not up to dishonest height.
19958,1541311,2,GonzalezCaroline,02/09/2021,"We stayed for 2 nights. Please note, you are asked to eat at the restaurant for a minimum of 30 euros to have unlimited free parking and water. False, we were made to pay 9 euros for parking ... A total of 2 days 70 euros to 3. Very expensive dishes, bread and condiments ...."
19958,1459723,1,nick83b,15/08/2021,"Parking in a small spot 9 euros, no shadow
Cold Shower costs 2 euro each time each person
Owner rather unfriendly
Restaurant, two meals and two drinks 41 euros
Refill water 4 euros
Electric 4 euros
As a emergency 1 night stop OK, but nothing else
Our costs 2x6   9  4  4 = 28 euros"
19958,1385011,5,KlausReinhold,31/07/2021,"Unfortunately, I was there as the restaurant was closed. But I got to know warm people, everything was very clean and well-kept. Everything you need is there and the price is right. The caretaker, Stefan is German and very helpful. Was there 2 days and it was great 2 days, I was told where to go, for example. Reservoir, dreamy places. Can only recommend the place despite the distance to the sea."
19958,1217879,5,janitshka,25/05/2021,"Straightforward and very friendly. We were able to do a PCR test here around noon for € 110 and had the printed result in the late afternoon. You can eat well. Disadvantage: Unfortunately, the street next door is a bit noisy."
19958,1217447,5,Wilmhobby,25/05/2021,Friendly greeting. Everything you need is there and the parking fee is waived if consumed in the restaurant. The best thing is that the PCR test runs smoothly. Relaxed waiting for the result over a beer.
19958,1186765,1,veresa,06/05/2021,"Unfortunately only one star! Very unfriendly groundskeeper, 08/15 food and everything costs extra: water, electricity, disposal. The location next to a main road completed the poor overall impression. There is a star for the corona test, which can be done on site (€ 110 per person plus € 1 for printing). Otherwise absolutely no recommendation."
19958,1184144,4,caroona,03/05/2021,"The parking space would be assigned to me on arrival. Despite the low number of visitors, you had to stand very close to your neighbor in the late afternoon. The tone is decisive but friendly. It's okay for a night in transit. The food in the restaurant is ok."
19958,1167990,4,Heikeundbonnie,05/04/2021,"We were there on March 30th, 21st to do a corona test, which also works, but you have to be there until shortly before 12 p.m. to take the test and get the certificate at around 6 p.m. in the evening. We saw this on YouTube, but you have to pay 110 euros for the test in cash in advance, there is no ATM there just for information, on YouTube they say that you can also pay by card, unfortunately that's not true. The food was good and the price was okay too. You are friendly ."

19958,792877,1,akou,08/03/2020,"We stopped here due to good reviews for space and food. Unfortunately we cannot find anything positive here. It's very remote and on the main road, park like sardines. With dogs you have no way to go for a walk. Visavi's dog ban. The food was a big letdown. A small portion of Kätzpätzle at the Spätzle Fritz for € 11 (without salad). Absolute rip off!"

The worst is that there were more motorhomes inside without being able to leave before any emergency without any contact with the owner, or phone number or anything. I penalize this place for lack of formality."

But bathrooms closed as the wind blows, they tell you because of Covid-19, but in the afternoon they were open with showers running and the next day no longer because of Covid-19.

19967,1737481,3,Carlosvictor,20/01/2022,"Good place with services, the city council is thanked, foreigners do not comply with the measures, they take out chairs, they reserve places, something that they cannot do in their country."

19967,1716696,5,EvaBraddock,27/12/2021,spent 3 nights here on the weekend. there were a lot of other vans and campers but also regular cars and even 2 trucks.  only Saturday night was noisy as some youngsters with couple of cars came to party here. other than that - to wake up looking at the view of  orange groves and hills behind - worth it.
19967,1707279,3,MatteoTettamanti,09/12/2021,"Free area, quiet area in front of a beautiful orange plantation, unloading and loading just outside the entrance. Sandy soil. For the rest, one night is recommended."

19967,1701024,5,Flipper_Mobil,01/12/2021,Great place in the middle of a valley with beautiful hiking routes around it. The ground is level and as long as it is dry you can stand here very well. Fresh water and gray water work perfectly. Thanks to the community.

19967,1638035,3,Pacoses,10/10/2021,"It is a shame that politicians boast of wanting to promote tourism in places as exquisite as Simat and Valldigna and put so little effort into offering an area suitable for a booming sector such as motorhomes. It would be time to asphalt the area and you have a potable water tap and drain in good condition, the cost of which is not that high."

19967,1196207,1,DaniAmigo,14/05/2021,I was there a month ago and it looks like anything but a motorhome area. I went for a walk with my dogs as soon as I arrived and on the way back I found little children who were throwing oranges. I picked up and went to another nearby area.
19967,1194900,2,Langar,13/05/2021,"Area without any service. Trucks and neighbors' cars park here, in addition to being the pee-dog of the entire neighborhood. It is an esplanade very exposed to the air. Of course, very good views. We had no problems of children bothering us."

19967,1153813,5,SYNpilote,19/03/2021,To be free this is very good! There is a beautiful monastery next to the town perfect to spend a night and visit this charming town. Walking routes !!
19967,1136579,5,LauraV123,11/02/2021,"We’ve now been here a number of times across the last few months (November-February) between one night and a whole week. We’ve had oranges thrown at the van once but only on our first time here and never again since. The town is lovely and whilst the monastery is closed, it’s still nice to visit around. Also some incredible hikes. The place is very safe too! And sure not the cleanest of park ups but if you’re looking for any better than simply go to a campsite and pay :) there’s no rubbish left around and really nothing to complain about. NOTE: the brown lid to the black water hole is not blocked. It simply needs a bit more of a tug. There is an older man occasionally in the chicken plot who will help if needed - he gave the cover a knock with a rock on the side and it immediately lifted. DO NOT empty in the blue hole - he doesn’t approve."
19967,1131420,4,Lubin131955Louka,18/01/2021,"We have been here for hiking 10+ times, and have never had a problem with kids or other people"

19967,1121454,1,rafafpf,15/12/2020,"Well, the same as other comments, some children throwing oranges at the vehicle. In the end we left."
19967,1120226,1,salolimu,08/12/2020,"Yesterday we had to go, because a group of girls between 10 and 12 years old were dedicated to throwing oranges from the orchard next door. On top of that the monastery is closed for works, the kids, apparently they have nothing else to do than to scare away the few tourists who pass by."
19967,1119382,2,rolfoer,04/12/2020,We'll be leaving again tomorrow. The place is okay and the view of the orange plantations is nice here. The monastery is unfortunately closed and the place is very empty due to Corona. The local children also threw oranges at our car several times. Not very pleasant because it was late and we are traveling with a baby.
19967,1117776,4,TeamGG,26/11/2020,Excellent facilities near the town centre and Monastery. Water tap does not have a screw fitting so bring container or relevant attachment. Easy grey and black waste access. We parked on road which was fine. Thank you to the town for the facilities.
19967,1117507,3,Sniper2,24/11/2020,"It is simple dirt parking with services next to road. What makes it special is that right next to it is orange orchard with a view on montains. There were some local kids throwing oranges on our car, but left it once we find out. Otherwise we slept well."
19967,1116394,4,hponwheels,19/11/2020,"The place is not a big deal, but it deserves 4 stars because we were able to empty gray and black water, and refill water (there is a fountain but we had to do it by filling the tank with bottles, as it was not possible to connect the hose) the monastery is closed ! And although the area is not a big deal, I must thank the people for thinking of us! Therefore 4 stars!"
19967,1116273,4,estherkuntzelaers,19/11/2020,"Great place, quiet night, filling and discharging okay. 3 other campers here. monestry was closed unfortunately."

19967,1111218,3,wokewy,02/11/2020,Stayed overnight along with 5 other vans. Well placed just off of the main motorway. Aire has water and wc emptying just outside the fenceline. It is basically a gravel carpark and very dusty. It is also used by dog walkers so be careful where you tread. Monastery is very close and gets good reviews from those who have visited. Would use again as an overnight stop.
19967,1110809,4,rafafpf,01/11/2020,"The services are under the area sign, not in the ground parking. Drinking water with a blue cap and black with a cap that says ""lighting"" ??. There is another push-button tap. The environment is very good for cycling or hiking routes, and a great monastery. The parking is dirt, without shade and shared with other vehicles. Thanks to the City Council for the area."
19967,918233,1,EliseVictorciriviera,01/08/2020,"Only one dirt parking. The good thing is the free services. There is no shade or nothing, in summer it is impossible to stay so hot."

19967,793259,4,Parcnuit,09/03/2020,Superb welcoming area. Thanks to the municipality. Too bad to suffer the incivility of some. Everything is theirs. In particular 3 poorly parked Dutch occupying 6 potential places. Laying out table and deckchair in the passage ... A shame!

19967,786378,4,Spinynorman,25/02/2020,"4 stars though because we still love Simat. Excellent walking, great road cycling up the hairpins and a stunning monastery. We dont want the area to be closed because of some thoughtless behaviour"
19967,786376,4,Spinynorman,25/02/2020,"Arrived in Simat this morning to discover some motorhomer with no common sense has poured the contents of their toilet cassette into the blue hatch that houses the fresh water tap! WORSE, according to the friendly man who keeps his chickens by the service point, he has already cleaned it once and has no intention of doing it again. I wish whoever did this had the decency to have cleaned it!!"

19967,769237,1,valou06,16/01/2020,"Arrival at 6 p.m. today. Crowded area. There are 3 of us on the street. 2 places are used by a local truck and its crates for the harvest of oranges, without counting those which are parked in width with trailer which take 3 places."
19967,755763,3,gravey,22/12/2019,Super little place at the back of a small village. The bank only charged €1.75 to take money from its card machine.

19967,741555,4,Batding,11/11/2019,Great place for a night or two and yes the monastery is well worth a look. The downside is the amount of dog crap on the carpark. It really spoils the stop when you have to dodge it all.
19967,729612,5,Roberts92,25/10/2019,"Full services, just outside of the carpark, (no toilet) fresh water is under lid on the floor. Nice views around, lots of people stayed, quiet night."
19967,721158,2,patgrigo,14/10/2019,"Two stars for the area because it's pretty rudimentary, but thank you to the municipality to provide us with a place for us motorhome because on the sea is quite complicated, we visited the monastery, the visit is free and really worth a look, we visited the week on a Monday in October, it was very nice because quiet and silent, the inner peace that I felt on this site made me a lot of good ."

19967,713705,2,Josephinemarteens,05/10/2019,"Parking in earth and pebbles next to the drainage area. The hotel is located in the village, near the monastery to visit. Really beautiful monastery, young girl very friendly home. The village is just as well, with its fishpond and its pretty café terraces. There is a pizzeria right in front of the monastery, I recommend it."
19967,682301,4,rizosenteruel,08/09/2019,"Quiet site near the ruins of the monastery. Esplanade of level land, it is not parceled or has shadows, but there is to empty (gray and black) and fill (source), it is in the street not in the esplanade."
19967,653680,3,GaraziMayordomo,23/08/2019,"Recommended for one night. The white water tap and the poty are improvable, but can be used. The tap must be pressed continuously. The area is sand / ground and is good for its breadth, plots not limited but without shade. Near the ruins of a beautiful monastery to see."

19967,494595,4,padraigl,27/05/2019,"A sandy carpark on the edge of town surrounded by orange groves. There were a few mosquitos about. Close to bars, shops, bakery and the fantastic monastery.

There are full services but no signage. Grey waste is in the normal type ground drain. 
The black WC drain is under a square cover that has been battered by tyres of motorhomes. You may need a screwdriver to lift this if it feel stuck. A good yank on it will lift it. 
The fresh water in under the same type cover as the black WC drain but painted blue. It lifts easily. You will find a single medium screw-on connection facing up towards you. 
The water fountain with a push button tap is also painted blue and I saw people drinking from it so it must be fresh water. Only concern is people using it for the WC cassette clean.

We had 2 pretty quiet nights. Yes there was noise from the local bars on the Saturday night but that's the advantage of been close to the town. Some fruit lorries park here also and they leave early in the morning.

We had a relaxing drink in Juniors Bar around the corner that had free WiFi. Very reasonable priced. 1 large beer and a white wine for €3.

We didn't get to complete our usual walks in the hill due to an injury and there are quite a few but we will be back.
We had a look around the monastery and ground which is free and very interesting.
The large pool with fish and the outside clothes washing area were also interesting. Both beside the river."
19967,490054,5,andrewmack,22/05/2019,"Potable drinking water under the blue cover, take a screwdriver to lift it. Very quiet night sleep and beautiful views surrounded by tall hills.

There is also no service, the photo of the gray and black water basin is non-existent. At least it's a cool and quiet place that's not bad for a night, even in the sports center there's a pretty decent bar."

I'm only passing through and it would be nice if the municipality did what was necessary, especially for Spaniards. Because there are not too many stops for Camping Cars. Above all, do not go out through the village. In the end, I do not recommend this area."

Highly recommended with water and drainage service, torraderos, park, tennis courts, soccer and others and in summer swimming pool.

This camperstop puzzled us a bit. We couldn't find the water/ waste dump despite an extensive search. The parking area is tiny with no room for more than 4 vans.
A small canalized water system flows alongside the site and therefore the mosquitoes are a nightmare!"

The sources of the entire town are cut, we assume that by the covid. In the village there is a small grocery store with many things. All the signs are for a caravan at 100 m and that's why people get lost, follow the GPS. Very calm."

19968,343259,4,luzzyta,19/08/2018,"Quiet area to sleep. Yes, I would not call for motorhomes because the entrance is very narrow. We went with a camper and we entered well, but if you go with a large motorhome I think that you will not be able to give the necessary curve to enter. Then once inside there are enough trees so I also think you would play ... I have put some pictures. Ah! Another thing in the street Torrebaja is the emptying not the area .. the area is 100 meters but well signposted. What I said if you go with a motorhome, go slowly and carefully because the navigator took us through the town and the streets are narrow. Crossing a park that is in the area there is a bar nearby with swimming pools and public toilets. (At least on these dates)"

19981,2589170,3,HeinMueckEU,24/02/2023,"I can't quite share the euphoria. The place is fine and clean. However, the pitches are extremely narrow (3.90m wide and 7.60 long, a little overhang in length is possible, but 8m would be very tight because then nobody can get past) and since they are right next to the sports field and swimming pool, it is not always so calm. Definitely better than the neighboring square in Abla right on the street. Many thanks to the community for the service!"

Parking on flat and shaded asphalt, water and practical drains, toilets for the disabled, a very large picnic area with dozens of shaded tables and barbecues. Next door there is also a communal swimming pool (€ 3 adult entrance / € 2 for children under 14) open until 8 pm. All located in a small quiet village, with no noise and perfect weather day and night! Highly recommended!"

19981,173440,5,silviasb1,13/08/2017,Quiet place You have to open the gate to enter. There is a fountain.
19981,123666,5,lucebinouze,21/03/2017,"Good place to rest quietly! We were out of season. Parking and there are places for barbecues, tables below. We had the honor of having in the late afternoon an elder who came to play guitar in the parking lot. A great time!"

19982,3165412,5,CPCBCN,17/08/2023,"We have spent three days on the beach, calm and comfortable. When night falls, background music is heard. It is advisable to get as close as possible to the lighthouse. The area has water intakes. Bars to make good tapas one step away."
19982,3124099,3,slam,11/08/2023,"The place is magnificent, overlooking the beach and close to shops and bars, but when night falls, that's when you go crazy. You end up dreaming in reggaeton, Dady yanki becomes your Morpheus. There are no cojones to close your eyes, because every grave in the song opens them for you. The windows of the car vibrate. Impossible to sleep. The party lasts until 6 at least. Better the other side of the door"
19982,3069500,5,JCG59,03/08/2023,"Great place, close to beach and store. Jet ski at the end of the parking lot. A little noise at night because music from nearby cafes."

19982,2821285,1,Glovetrotter,05/06/2023,"The area is luxurious but it is impossible to sleep due to the deafening noise and pounding throughout the night from some nearby disco pubs. I spoke to the local police and they told me that the noise is within the allowed range, which is impossible since even the deaf can hear it. What has been said: if you are going to rest, forget it unless you want to remember the cod route."
19982,2784527,5,Yoombo,25/05/2023,Super. Small and quiet harbour. Town beach just 1 m away. In a middle of apartments village.
19982,2682926,5,Paka,20/04/2023,A very warm welcome and a very nice place. silent. 13 euros per night without electricity. all services for the truck

19982,2627309,4,PhoenixCologne,27/03/2023,The place is quite ok for visiting Almerimar. The harbor master is friendly and at least the pitches with electricity have a nice view over the harbor wall to the sea or the snow-capped mountains of the Sierra Nevada. Good stage place for the journey to Tarifa or Morocco. It's just a parking space and not a campsite.
19982,2613139,3,MobilLoewe,17/03/2023,"How you can give this place 5 stars is beyond me. The pitches are narrow, awnings are usually not possible. The tourist retort city in the ""Mar de plástico"" inspires some, not us. The registration and payment is bureaucratic, ID card, telephone number, license plate number. You have to sign an A4 piece of paper, you just don't know what you're signing. 3 stars, well"
19982,2609403,4,sylmarcel,14/03/2023,"great area it's the second time we come, but you have to stand towards the entrance because at the bottom there is a bar with loud music."
19982,2605189,5,leif426,10/03/2023,"Now we are here for the fourth time! I think this little Ställplatser is a real gem. Perfect location by the beach and walks. Close to shops and a stone's throw from restaurants in the heart of the harbour. But don't stand there on the weekend, because then it's disco until 05!"
19982,2603153,2,JeffWor,08/03/2023,"The toilets/showers are quite far, and anyone with a walking disability will have a difficult time (as my wife did). In the summer when the yachts are also active, toilets/showers will be crowded as it is small."
19982,2603151,4,JeffWor,08/03/2023,You must choose your place first and make note of the number. Numbers beginning with 1 can use electricity. Numbers beginning with 2 cannot. Then go to the harbour master's office in the white building with the lighthouse on top to sign up and pay. Keys for the toilets are given in exchange for a EUR 20 deposit or an ID.
19982,2598034,5,Helton,04/03/2023,"Great marina stop. Well marked pitches, electricity included, close (very) to bars, restaurants etc. Supermarkets 10 mins walk away. 

Some noise from restaurants but that's one of the reasons you park here."
19982,2597606,1,heisaindecampe,04/03/2023,"great place to stand, but what a noise in the night. Until 04:00 loud music from discos. terrible. we wanted to stay several nights but the noise is terrible."
19982,2591797,5,ManfredEk,26/02/2023,"Have been here before. Very nice place. Well suited for self-sufficient WoMo, since the places with electricity are often occupied!"

19982,2580688,4,RWDW0529,17/02/2023,"Spent 2 nights here (€13 per night, no electric). Nice and flat, lovely harbour area with shops and bars. Water, grey and black waste emptying available. Paid €20 deposit for a key to the showers but didn’t use them as they looked and smelt filthy and were a long way to walk. Great stop off in a lovely area."
19982,2578218,4,EuropamitEdi,15/02/2023,A nice place at the port. It's quiet and you can see the boats. It takes 10 minutes to walk to the toilets and showers on the other side of the harbor basin. The shower is clean and hot.
19982,2575695,4,rob_machin,12/02/2023,"Stayed here on 10/2,,  its a great place to chill overlooking the marina, all services great price too,, good luck getting a spot thou as it's a very busy place.
Spot on,,"
19982,2571042,1,hhollstegge,07/02/2023,"Hopelessly crowded, close to close. We've been here before, felt comfortable, but - NO THANKS! Even if we had gotten a seat (but there wasn't any more at 4 p.m.) we would have continued driving anyway."
19982,2568471,5,Midwifes,04/02/2023,"I thought I would only stay here 1-2 nights, but I enjoy the surroundings so much and right now the weather is fantastic. So it will probably take longer. It's tight between the mobile homes and full all the time, someone goes and it fills up immediately. So a popular place."
19982,2568248,4,Chrissis58,04/02/2023,good place. Well busy. many restaurants nearby. Can you stand for a while.
19982,2560962,3,Tipster69,26/01/2023,"The place itself is very nice, having stopped here before, in the Summer.

But in the Winter months, trying to get a pitch seems nie on impossible, as people seem to bed down for months at a time.

We've given up this time as not possible, and headed elsewhere (unfortunately)."
19982,2559596,1,MIB100,24/01/2023,"At 3 p.m. already full. In addition to that unfriendly staff, which shows that there is no need for other customers. The campers are tight and for 15.00 euros. To escape, because we don't need it either!"
19982,2553060,4,JamesAshby,16/01/2023,Lovely spot right on the marina. We came for one night and stayed for four! There's two sides - can park right outside the office for €13 and no electric and can't have chairs out etc... (although most people did). The €15 spot inside the larger area is better. Go to the office at the end of the marina to check in on arrival. Lovely hot powerful showers and lots of nice places to eat and drink.
19982,2545133,4,wariam,07/01/2023,"Travel parking on the asphalt in the port, but chairs and tables are allowed to be outside, e.g. during meals, after which they must be removed. Shops and restaurants, laundromat right next to it. You might hear music from the restaurant at night, but it didn't bother me. The shower and toilet are on the other side of the harbor basin, so it will take a little longer to get there. I could go again."
19982,2539802,5,Santana2023,03/01/2023,"Our personal favorite spot, including electricity for 15 euros per night. We stayed three nights this time. At the weekend you can hear the music of the discotheques. You are right on the sea, at the port and there is something going on. That's how we like it, shops within walking distance. Everything can be set up, awning, table and chairs."
19982,2538961,1,ManiobaLocoIvan,02/01/2023,"The price is expensive for what it really is, a parking lot. Very busy area since it is the seaport and there are many bars. Beach close but somewhat dirty. It does not give a feeling of insecurity but there is a lot of movement at night. One night, use services and continue traveling."
19982,2524089,1,0800phil,18/12/2022,As a customer we did not feel welcomed. Looking  at their smartphone instead of having a normal conversation with you as a customer.
19982,2500420,4,saroelena,19/11/2022,"it was very windy and we were very exposed and it swayed a lot. The noise of the wind and how the boats whistled ... we could not sleep almost at all. on the other hand, the drainage area is in the middle of the transit path. We arrived at 9:00 p.m. and we had to leave it at 12:00 (like a hotel) being low season. Despite that, Almerimar has a lot of life and many bars to eat luxury."
19982,2497971,4,womi001,17/11/2022,"Great parking space, and there are enough spaces available. Costs 15 euros including electricity. Free toilet and fresh water and disposal. Also good for large mobile homes. You can get tickets for the parking fee from the tower, you need to hand in your car license plate number and cell phone number."
19982,2495152,4,kake,14/11/2022,"nice place. the captaincy speaks French. many beaches around are available for wild camping. pleasant jogging on the seafront. personally, I did not use the sanitary facilities at the port. If I go back to the area, I will definitely come back. we see the boats returning to port and there is a superb sunset...."
19982,2493753,5,tingeling,13/11/2022,Really one of my favorite spots. Will be back.
19982,2489784,4,Vandiamo,10/11/2022,Our 3rd visit back here and it’s much bigger than last time we were here but still as enjoyable if not for the first night & the wind making an awful noise whistling through the boat masts. Full servicing & electricity available although we didn’t use toilets & showers. Great bike paths everywhere & a lovely walk through the marina & along the promenade. Surround by supermarkets on the way in
19982,2457476,2,SvenBojnert,23/10/2022,"Nice place to stay at, i.e weekdays, but not friday and saturday. Awfull noice from the pubs in the neigborhood. started with LOUD music all night long from 10 pm and stoped about 05 am. 
Then the showers and toiletts are too far from the campervans, but good for the boatcampers.
Without the noice it would be 4 stars, but now just 2 but nearly 1, sorry :("
19982,2254345,4,SonyGasteiz,17/08/2022,Fantastic views of the port and the beach. During the week there has been no noise or commotion at night despite being August. Now the hits: The bathrooms/showers are super far from P2 and P1. You almost need the bike to go. Better not have any urgency. A separate water intake for gray and black water would be required.
19982,2220152,5,viajero.,12/08/2022,"Great space to be very comfortable. Prices are never exceeded, tolerant to the maximum, and in addition, you will sleep surrounded by yachts. Lastly! They charge per motorhome regardless of the people traveling."
19982,1969112,3,latecoaire,12/06/2022,Fairly large plot. No shade. Very noisy at night on weekends.
19982,1917976,5,Jeanpierreletanter,26/05/2022,"Brilliant, on the port, near the shops and the beach. We just used the services"

19982,1856478,4,jamigui,27/04/2022,very good. we can never say enough that marinas are natural bivouacs for motorhomes...and harbor master's offices are good caretakers...h
19982,1827095,3,Spontan,16/04/2022,In fact very noisy at night due to the music coming from one of the bars in the harbour.
19982,1819821,3,jmariete,13/04/2022,"views of the sea/beach and the port. (pebble beach). €30 for two nights with electricity, you have to pay in captaincy. Easy download and upload. For bathrooms/showers you have to ask for a key, we don't use them. Close to bars and restaurants, Easter without noise. With a lot of air the masts of the boats buzz and it can be annoying."
19982,1793015,3,Kwakaman,23/03/2022,"Booked in easily with Harbour master in the lighthouse and were lucky to get a pitch close to an electrical outlet. We visited on a Friday and yes as others have stated it was noisy not only from the night club but also from cars driving around and playing loud music.
The harbour area was very pretty albeit with very little open.

My advice would be forget the electric and park at the top end."
19982,1785935,3,SimonandVicky,17/03/2022,"Lovely views but not allocated spaces so parking a free for all and can be difficult hooking to nearest electric point, need plenty of cable. Toilet and shower are 10 min away behind restaurant, you need a key. Recomend you avoid Friday to Sunday as very noisy from nearby nightclub and this was in February, so coy be worse in Summer."
19982,1778380,5,Katebmorris,09/03/2022,Great location.  Fabulous views.  We’ve been here numerous times.  Shops and restaurants within easy walking distance.  Great cycle path.   Go to the lighthouse for reception.  Love it!
19982,1777416,2,L159,08/03/2022,"no chairs and tables may be put out on P1, only on P2 - what sense that makes is incomprehensible, totally funny. the place actually has no charm or flair. for sightseeing ok"
19982,1776391,4,big,07/03/2022,this day for 2 nights with electricity and services 30.01 ttc. always so pleasant. big02
19982,1750117,1,Ralf0815,07/02/2022,"No electricity, no table & chair outside, toilet tucked away 750 meters across the harbour, zero waste disposal and high live in the pubs until 5am on weekends. What am I paying 13 € for??? And to top it all off, electricity also costs €13. Never again"
19982,1747873,2,ejfrisco,05/02/2022,"Good view, sanitary facilities or electricity (at least in the area near the harbor entrance/tower: no. We were there on Fridays: very loud at night - DISCO until 5 a.m. Costs (only for standing): 13 €."
19982,1739934,2,Costablanca,23/01/2022,Good situation within the port of Almerimar but the plots are too small. The discharge of water is a dirty place because they are in the very center of the area. On weekends it is impossible to sleep because of the high volume of music from the neighboring clubs.
19982,1737772,1,MarisaSerrano,20/01/2022,"I arrive today and I go to the area, which is full, and I don't care if it's not because they spend 4 months there. The areas are supposed to have a time limit. then they refer me to another of the same, which is also almost full and they charge me 13 euros. the bathrooms to take by sack and are shared with the entire port, a baton I will not return."
19982,1727561,3,Frankenexpress2,06/01/2022,"Absolute recommendation. Great view of the harbor.

19982,1709197,3,Samuell,12/12/2021,"The parking space is right at the harbor, the plots are ok and the area is nice after all the plastic greenhouses. At the weekend, the place is not recommended, at least in the part near the city. It is very noisy until the morning as there is a club nearby. When we were standing there, the police had to clear up a fight at 3:30 in the morning."
19982,1706563,3,steso,08/12/2021,"Actually a very nice parking space right at the harbor for 13 euros including electricity. Unfortunately, it was extremely windy and loud from a mast from the sailing ship and there was no free socket anymore ... So only recommended if the wind is not too strong ... Clean toilets and showers are available with a key for a deposit of 20 euros."
19982,1701277,4,Gribouille81,01/12/2021,Aire at the port with a beautiful view. 13 euros with electricity to be paid at the harbor master's office. We did not see or use the toilets or showers. A bit noisy with the strong wind today.
19982,1659258,4,Elsmon,24/10/2021,"23.10. for 1 night. During the night it was noisy until 6 (Saturday). Bar loud, music loud. It is mostly young people who hear their loud music singing loudly and arrive or leave with great speed. 2. Minus point: distance to shower / toilet. We are standing by the church and have to walk about 600 meters. Otherwise a really good, pretty, clean and cheap place. 13 € / night with electricity."
19982,1653714,4,papou74,20/10/2021,Quiet night you have to go to the harbor master's office to pay € 13 with electricity for 1 night
19982,1652029,5,helenandgraham,19/10/2021,"Stayed here overnight. Nice safe location. Monday night meant that it was not as noisy as some people have suggested, obviously late in season and mid week. Still busy though, but enough space to feel comfortable. Park first, then go over to the tower building to check in. Not expensive at €13 inc EHC. Cafe / bars in easy reach plus supermarkets. Lovely sunsets."

19982,1538939,4,OscarBerga,01/09/2021,We spent a quiet night at the end of August. Restaurants and supermarkets nearby. Better to park away from restaurants to avoid noise and cars in the parking lot. Clean showers and sinks
19982,1515634,3,AUTOCARAVIAJAND,26/08/2021,"Good area for price with shops restaurants nearby ... Safe beach for children although it smells a bit stagnant. Get away from the fenced area, I recommend closer to the lighthouse, noise at night near the fenced area, after closing bars at 1pm ... some young people came to make noise we called the police of El Ejido it happened at 5 min and then quiet night."
19982,1502851,1,fani.ninfa,23/08/2021,"Unfenced private area. no surveillance. It is right in the party zone, and we were up all night because they came to urinate and make a bottle on the hood of the motorhome. We will not go back there, on top of that you pay for the service, you are awake, how do you think not to fence the area, or to put it further away from the nightlife area. We spent one night and the next we went to a public parking lot"

19982,1475749,4,DiOSauto,18/08/2021,"A very well located area, on the one side port and on the other beach ... sunset from the car. People respect the spaces and despite taking out a chair to take the fresh air, no noise is generated. At 12 o'clock at night they close the barrier. With the restrictions on the hotel business at 2 o'clock, music was no longer heard, but it is true that there is another quieter side, ask in the tower."

I have just arrived at the Tower and I have had to leave the ac parked badly because there is a barrier 250 meters from the tower. Pure port but whoever walks in. In short, I have been waiting for half an hour with the motorhome parked in a roundabout because I cannot happen. for now I put a bad score."

19982,771961,4,christado,24/01/2020,"Good parking space. The location at the port office has a very nice view. Outside of the marked places you are very close there. At the Outer Mole location, it is usually more sheltered and quieter. In addition, you have more privacy if the other motorhomes think along. What was new was that there are egoists who do not have a power connection but annoy everyone else with generators."
19982,770391,5,Crooksynpotts,19/01/2020,This is a fantastic site. The reception at the tower was extremely friendly. Yes you are tightly packed. Showers are a small walk away but are very warm/hot. Lots of bars nearby. Grey and black water disposal in the middle if the site. Ps the water tap near this drain (with a pipe attached) is for toilet wash. Fresh water next tap along or along the quay. very quiet at night (Sunday and Monday).

Couldn't get a hot shower tried 3 times the staff admit its a problem. Some people letting dogs roam off lead and barking very annoying to us.Will try again when the masses retreat.

19982,724073,5,pcd,17/10/2019,Great stop over or for longer some people my find the black water and grey water  disposal a bit basic  but if everyone uses it properly there is no problem the water hose is there to rinse things with there are other taps to use for tank filling very few Spanish people drink tap water only bottle water.Some complain about the week end noise ! remember we are guest where ever we go if you don’t like it don’t stay Most Spanish towns are loud at weekends and everything starts later so goes on longer.A very good place to spend a little RR.??
19982,686504,4,jonandoni,11/09/2019,"Good place to spend the night, attached to the beach and with restaurants and services very close. The price itself includes services. 10e the night and you have no time of entry or exit. Pubs nearby but very quiet during the week. The bad when there is a west wind, a lot of wind and you can't be there."
19982,679377,4,carretero,06/09/2019,"Good place, we spent two nights there with option of light hitch so perfect. Sea in front, near bars, ice cream parlors, churrería ... Of course there is a lot of music noise from some pubs on weekends. Well in general if you want beach. The quiet port, 10 euros plus 3 light per night."
19982,675983,1,zazi82170,04/09/2019,We had planned to stay there for 2 nights and could not stay here - this is a vulgar tar parking pity for its location. no service other than a vulgar pit and a faucet
19982,654954,1,Jeanette,24/08/2019,Unfortunately disco until the morning. It's 6:32 pm Saturday and full of bass music. therefore the village is extinct. Authorities accept something like that. Unfortunately.

19982,638165,4,Nanou5,17/08/2019,Perfect. Facing the sea on the harbor. Very nice staff. We paid 13 euros for one night with electricity a motorhome and two adults. The harbor is very busy a lot of restaurant. I recommend.

19982,508929,4,jairob,09/06/2019,"It is great because it is next to a beach, to the port area with the biggest boats and all the services of the marina. It is also spacious and economical since it costs € 10 € 3 light. The biggest inconvenience at the weekend is the music of the pubs that depends on the parking area you hear more or less."
19982,499015,4,yeyi,31/05/2019,"We spent the night of May 15, quiet and pleasant. We arrived late so we could not use the showers. As they say in other comments people use the filling hose to clean the cassette, luckily I carry my hose. Otherwise very good and in a good area."

19982,437292,1,edouard75003,07/03/2019,Nice place but it’s disgusting that everyone has to use the same dump and hose for drinking water and cleaning your toilet! It shouldn’t be aloud.

so noisy !!!"
19982,426265,4,mirabelle9,02/02/2019,Good situation. Port and beach nearby. Only complaint. Have to lift a manhole to empty the toilet. A single water hose that hangs on the ground and some (pigs) use to clean the inside of their cassette. brrrr! The next fills his tank of clean water with the same pipe.
19982,422937,5,Bernuy,16/01/2019,"Very good place to spend a few days. Bars and comeci very close. Very extensive and well-kept beach. Price of € 10 with access to the bathroom and showers. Light and wifi you have to pay, does not enter the price."

19982,365956,3,laillerp,06/09/2018,Really a pity that it is noisy. In addition there was a drag in the channel that makes noise all night. Otherwise it is a stop to recommend. No luck for us.

19982,345859,5,dcr,20/08/2018,"Super area With bathroom and showers. € 13 / day. Many bars and supermarkets nearby. The only drawback is the loud music every night in summer. They offer you the possibility of sleeping in a more remote area where you hear less music and also belongs to the port. Anyway, the theme of music we compensate with the rest of the advantages that the place has. All staff very friendly"
19982,341337,5,familitortatomi,18/08/2018,Very good site and good price! here if they want us !!

19982,317152,4,daviles,06/08/2018,The best we have found so far in the south. It is true that we miss something more control weekend nights. The sailors do what they can. They removed our beach towels during the early morning hours. The music of the discs high but not unbearable.

19982,307677,1,titilulu,31/07/2018,Unfortunately for once I have not respected the previous comments and I confirm the site could have been nice but our friends of techno and drinking have decided otherwise it is 5:46 in the morning on Tuesday 1 August and it's boom boom at bottom since 22h00 yesterday evening !! If you have to go through the? Go your way !! Small note 13 € is not expensive for a night in a box!
19982,287057,4,Biard,12/07/2018,"Good area but do not go on weekends because impossible to sleep with the nightclub next door. Otherwise if you have a mechanical problem, I highly recommend Francisco Gimenez to El Ejido who changed the clutch and greeted us in front of his garage so we would not go to the hotel. Really pros and not expensive compared to France"

19982,221548,4,mirabelle9,05/02/2018,Sanitary deplorable. A hole and a pipe that also serves to clean the cassettes. unworthy for this common

19982,199548,4,VoyageursJP59,02/10/2017,Nice place for a stage night. Beware of the disco music that night stopped after 4am. It is better to park near the tower for calm.

19982,144150,4,jairob,19/06/2017,"A good place to be on the beach with an electricity connection. At night the part that hits the pubs is noisy, but they have offered us another area that seems to be silent. They leave to take out awning and chairs, although to the not being a closed enclosure passes people near and lacks intimacy. In summer much better with air conditioning. Cars with caravan are welcome."

Thank you to the municipality that lets and thank you for solidarity."

In the first half of September we stayed for free but the rates were for the whole year and maybe something excessive but the site is well located. That yes, perhaps it lacks some tranquility because there are night clubs nearby with loud music."
19982,101582,1,Carloscalvoconde,30/08/2016,8/29/16 - Beautiful place but completely impossible to sleep by the nearby cocktail bars that keep the music very high until 6 am. The toilets far from the area. Port staff very friendly. I think I will not be back in the summer. Carlos

If you want to take advantage of the stumps in the port, it is more complicated because they are 1/4 hour away on foot, but on the site there is water, enough to empty the cassette and the tank so we are independent."
19982,63006,3,mirabelle9,28/01/2016,"The place is nice. By cons the area is very poorly equipped on the hygiene side. A hole to empty everything. A single water hose, some use it to get into their cassette to clean it, others to refuel ""clean"" water. no comment."
19982,62276,3,chantalhirel,05/01/2016,"we are fine but the entrance to the car park is closed in early January. We are parked, ahead and without any problem."
19982,60858,4,eurohound,09/12/2015,"Parking by control tower is very pretty, water and draining included, electric extra. Showers a short walk away in the marina. Deposit for electric adaptor 40 € for shower key 5 €. Pay in the control tower, but closed 14:00-16:00"
19982,60373,5,Richrich,25/11/2015,"Great place a lots everything close by. Wonderful sunrises/sunsets and all facilities for €13 per night. Be careful though, you may end up staying a lot longer than you'd planned :-)"

19982,52572,1,michel06,27/08/2015,"Great ! Passage on August 16, 2015 back from Portugal sleepless night insured until 6:30 am, nightclub 50 meters and a stench that comes from the beach (for info, we can have free music all night on Saturday until 9am on Sunday morning). To escape the summer."
19982,38711,4,avatila,09/06/2015,"We were there in early April and end of May 2014 during a trip to Morocco, the people of the captaincy are great, the place is nice and completely safe"
19982,38707,4,lloydsinspain,09/06/2015,"An excellent place, fresh water available, grey and toilet disposal. Hook up if required. Keys to shower and toilets if required although they are probably a walk away. Noisy during fiestas and from May to September. Hence 4 stars. Close to bars beach and marina. A personal favourite of ours."
19982,33744,5,ktm4tiempos,15/04/2015,"This area is highly recommended, a town with an impressive port and full of sailboats that live in many of them, a 5 km walk and very quiet to walk with children, the beach is huge the problem is that it has no sand of stones."
19982,30703,4,gerardcc,19/01/2015,"On the harbor near the captaincy, all shops nearby. Payment to the captain's office 12.69 € with electricity. (9.15 without.)"

19983,2756676,4,roydendro,17/05/2023,We only filled up on water. Has connection for a hose but fills up very slow. Easy to reach.
19983,2739090,3,Piot59,10/05/2023,Convenient and free: we just used the services. Allow plenty of time for filling because it is a stream of water that runs. No shade.
19983,2650311,4,tms13,08/04/2023,"The area is fairly well leveled and paved, there are places but they are not specified with a symbol that is exact for ac/camper so if there is another vehicle, there is no space to get angry either. You have to understand that they are next to the fire department and they are all the year. The downside, there are dogs nearby and they bark so the night is not all quiet, but this place is better than other car parks than just to sleep."
19983,2580405,4,ThatThereMotorhome,17/02/2023,Good flat area it filled up after we had arrived. Water pressure for fresh water is low so it takes a while to fill up. Vehicles start moving 7am as fire service are here.
19983,2554595,4,brunoalexander,18/01/2023,Good as a place to stay. Supply and disposal easily possible.

We ate at the restaurant ""La esencia de la Alpujarra"" I recommend it, tapas and homemade portions, the owner Carlos and his wife are beautiful people, they treated us with luxury, we will return."
19983,2512699,5,OlgaCamargo,04/12/2022,"Visited in winter. We travel with a Camper van. Super quiet place at night and gave us a sense of security having a fire station. We had an incident with our van and they were super kind. We were able to refill the water, but there is no hose, you have to bring it. We were able to empty both water tanks."
19983,1910432,3,Aloys52686,23/05/2022,"At the local fire department. It is not a beauty, but getting water and discharging is also worth something. Fine for one night. Fumbling about the water taps? PRIMA DRINKING WATER comes out of both taps. (source: local fire brigade."
19983,1882378,4,ptcarlospt,10/05/2022,"Good location, everything working, place to empty gray and black water. The only problem is that the taps to wash the cassette and fill the tank are next to each other and I saw colleagues using one or the other without distinction. I would avoid drinking this water just to be safe."
19983,1852126,4,alaineve74,25/04/2022,"Be careful, do not enter the village because the road is cut at the exit (collapse) and it is very difficult to turn around if more than 6 meters long."
19983,1791140,3,hponwheels,22/03/2022,"The town has its charm, thanks to the City Council, but our firefighter friends park their cars in the AC squares, those small gestures are what stigmatize Andalusians! Respect the AC spaces that you have plenty of place to park!!!"

19983,1639887,4,angelgil,11/10/2021,"Well lit area, quiet although close to the road. There is not much traffic, we parked in the square next to a warehouse with the sloping wall and in the morning a lot of water began to come out of some pipes that are on the earth slope that put the entire perimeter of the van full of mud. Otherwise everything perfect."

19983,1628613,4,AiramH.,05/10/2021,"Super quiet area, with a pleasant walk to the town. The town with many closed shops, I imagine it being Monday and October. The great area, in the absence of a hose to fill the water that if you do not have your own complicated. Rest very good."

19983,1537868,4,EddyEddy,01/09/2021,"I visited for a very memorable 3 nights. Yes, there is noise occasionally, but otherwise good and feels very safe. 

What made my visit so special was the Mayor of the village greeting me when I arrived (he was there checking something). He introduced me to new friends, gave me a personal guided tour of some of the local points of interest and was very kind and welcoming in every respect."
19983,1525310,5,cimberian,28/08/2021,"Quiet place to spend the night, with all the emptying and filling of water services. Thank you very much Canjayar."

19983,1300603,4,NelsonMonPi,06/07/2021,"Secluded and quiet location (although close to the fire station). Gray and black water, drinking water intake. The only thing but is that it does not have a bathroom so if you don't have a toilet you have to manage. Thanks for enabling spaces like this!"
19983,1161094,4,JosePili06,30/03/2021,Motorhome area with all free services (without electricity). We only stopped to empty and fill next to a playground.
19983,1148585,5,dugi1959,07/03/2021,"Top place. Fresh water runs like clockwork, ie the fresh water tank is subito full. Empty cassette and gray water perfectly possible. Safe, quiet, clean place. Overnight stay / s possible. Such public spaces are very rare in Spain. Thanks the community!"

19983,1125555,4,MonicayPedro,29/12/2020,"It is a spacious place, with free filling and emptying of water. We arrived for a single night, but seeing that there were two small parks next to it and a sports court where the children were playing safely, we decided to stay all day. Highly recommended."
19983,1124062,3,journeyofhappiness,26/12/2020,"Seems to be normally open (12/26/20) no signs closed. However, with directions to the motorhome. But given the road works and a wall that is being rebuilt. It gives a somewhat desolate impression. Been here 2 years ago when had a great night with some noise from dogs. Now drove to the next village. If you are late and you are looking for a place I recommend it."
19983,1120176,1,CarolFernandes,08/12/2020,Closed due to covid
19983,1077258,4,beedgee,01/10/2020,"Functional. Service available. Free of charge. Otherwise we would never have seen the city. It is worth taking a short hike through the amazingly lively little beautiful city. Whoever is on security can hardly be more secure. The fire department is there all night. The main street rises in a serpentine over the square, but was quieter in the evening."
19983,1068854,1,Uribe,25/09/2020,"An area with all services, next to the fire department, a bit far from the town, but a pleasant walk"
19983,794265,4,stvn,11/03/2020,"Has everything you need. The lid from the black water drain won't stay open, which was a bit annoying. The water pressure was way beyond low, so bring some time to fill your water tank."
19983,792082,5,lady,07/03/2020,Thank you very much to the Bomberos for this area on their land. Calm night.
19983,784466,3,ScrappyDoo,22/02/2020,"A pretty village and worth a visit. It’s a steep decent/ascent via a newly erected parkway with nice views. It’s close to the road so obviously you’ll have some traffic noise and the fire station is next door.  Whilst I didn’t experience noise from the road during the night nor the fire brigade, it was the bloody goat herders dogs on the hillside opposite that were the problem!"
19983,783131,4,neilson,19/02/2020,"There's a steep footpath to the town, about 10 minute walk, a few shops and cafes around, siesta hours. Can recommend Cafeteria Pub Mirasol for coffee and drinks, very clean and friendly welcome. Lastly please take food for tiny abandoned cat, a few mins walk along main road from cafe, she's where there is wonderful view to the valley, she, just waits all day behind gate slowly starving."
19983,780426,1,SonjaundWolli,14/02/2020,"Good place for disposal and supply, thank you to the community. Good starting point for exploring the place. Bad place to stay. The goat farmer with lots of animals, his dogs, the fire brigade and the scales for trucks create an unsightly background noise."
19983,773148,5,josepus,27/01/2020,"The site is separated, but little. The very pretty town. And the area with all services and clean. It has shops and restaurants."
19983,765303,4,tonypaella,06/01/2020,"There is a beautiful road to the village, tis descending and climbing but doable. In the village there are small super bars, bars and restaurants. A dog barks but it is quite far away. Until 7 am there is no noise, forbidden"

19983,762689,5,Elocamper,02/01/2020,"This week we have spent a night in this area. We have been alone but we have slept very quiet. It is true that the barking of dogs from a nearby farm and cars are heard all night long by the road in front, but we have rested well. From where we parked we saw an incredible sunrise."
19983,751375,5,thegatehouses,08/12/2019,"Great stop off at the local fire station. 
Water, grey & black waste - it looks as if the black waste can wash under the grey waste drain when a lot poured in, people didn't empty incorrectly while we were there, so just try to wash grey waste through after black or rinse both. 
Walk down hill into town - lots of little shops and few eateries. Great area for cycling and walking."
19983,748622,3,Stinos,30/11/2019,"The place was full, right next to a road and not really what we were looking for. also a bit small for a nine meter bus. we decided to drive on."
19983,747285,3,albbolide,26/11/2019,"Space for emptying Supply good, road already audible, every now and then shunting trucks to Libra. Nice way to the village (steep), firefighters very friendly. Good for a night."
19983,736176,4,ctheron,02/11/2019,"I confirm the previous comments, the only downside for us will have been the flies certainly present due to the farm which is just above. but this is only a detail in view of the services provided."
19983,717775,5,cotard,10/10/2019,"I confirm, stop free service, do not hesitate to visit the very typical village and climb to the chapel for a splendid view."

19983,459047,5,ElJose,19/04/2019,"All ok, if it's true that there are dogs on a farm above that bark, but at night they did not bark. Quiet place All for free, only the water comes out with little pressure. Thanks to the municipality of Canjayar."

19983,264050,5,ANTERO,05/06/2018,A pretty good place to empty the gray and black deposits and even for the overnight is already very quiet.
19983,253300,3,Pkmacho,14/05/2018,Good area as such for discharge and water recharge. Good parking next to Fire and Civil Protection. But not so much when the night arrived that a lot of dogs started to bark and with that we can not. We had to leave.
19983,232626,5,Britania,02/04/2018,Really good that this is provided by the village nice place to stay with free facilities and places to eat in the village.

19983,229951,3,dodgelodge,26/03/2018,"So good to have a place where you can fill up your tank and get rid of the grey and black water, and for free! We camped at a parking in town, which we liked better. Not a parking for big campers though, for smaller ones I’d recommend going there. No road next to it with car noises. Below the agriculture building (big letters on the building with agriculura sth), there you’ll find a sign with ‘p’."
19983,225851,5,Bayimages,05/03/2018,"Great stop, all free. On a bit of a slope. Bomberos out early to test their equipment including sirens and disc cutter. :-( nice little town with a few bars and restaurants."
19983,224155,4,WillD,22/02/2018,"We spent a peaceful night here.  There was a 15 minute period of barking dogs at about 10pm and one lorry turned round but didn't come within a metre of any of the three vans.
The service point was easily accessible and clean.  The water was rather slow running but it is all for free.  Thank you!
A few minutes walk down into the town."

19983,119093,4,katradouz,30/01/2017,"Friendly area, free and especially very clean. Very large sites, free and functional services. The only fault is the two farms on the two opposite sides of the mountain: packs of dogs howl a lot of the night, we met the trouble the two times we parked there. It's quite difficult to bear. As in all Spain, dogs are left to their own devices and nobody does anything."
19983,118930,4,copvek,27/01/2017,"Great spot, clean with services (no electric). Adjacent to minor road with light noise. steep walk into the town and up to the church. Dream for road cyclists stunning switchback routes all around. Adjacent town, Ohanas, famous in the region for rose wine. No wifi signal but aire is 50 mtrs from mobile phone mast so good signal. 3 mini supermarkets in the town. DONT try to drive through narrow."
19983,112114,4,Motorhomefun,29/10/2016,Lovely spot considering the effort by the town. Very clean with lots of spaces. Only not long enough to suit the bigger motorhome. Great spot for a night but nothing much in the town but stray dogs and a good view from the church on the hill. Small play area and football pitch for those with kids.

19984,744629,4,padraigl,18/11/2019,"This is a very large area that looks like a wasteland surrounded by a steel fence and wall and subdivided into slightly raised sandy/stoney type areas where cars park. It's not level and there is no shade. 
There's NO dedicated motorhome parking. Motorhomes park around the service area. This area is perfect for larger motorhomes or ones towing a trailer.

Pros:
Free parking.
Free empting of grey and black WC 24*7*365.
Local supermarket, cafes and bars.
Market here Monday.

Cons:
Slight road noise.
No shade.
Public toilets only open during market days.
Token for €2 needed for all water from the sports center.

There are full services excluding electricity. The grey and black WC drains are free 24*7*365 but you need a token for all the water. This token costs €2 and is got from the sports center across the road. Also no token when the center is closed hence no fresh water.

The grey waste bay on a slight height is large with a ground drain grid and ok direction.

The black WC drain is under a heavy steel ground cover with a rope attached to the left of the taps. The drain has good direction with very little splashback. There is no dedicated cassette tap.

There are 2 taps on the wall with no signage and both have a small screw-on connection with a handle to adjust the pressure. Both these taps only work with a token.

There are small bins around the parking area and large bins where the market takes place.

We had 1 quiet night with 5 motorhomes. We were a little worried that we would be asked to leave early the next morning because of the market or possibly locked in until the market was over. The actual market takes place at the other side of the large area. The cars were parked close-by. The services were available during this time and we also could have left anytime. 

Bugs/Mosquitoes. (They love us..)
We did not encounter any mosquitoes here in mid November as it was cold and windy with rain during the night."

There are different entrances to different car parks. The beach at 100 meters and the bike path next door. The town about 2 km by bike and to empty and fill the car in the town you have two ACs areas. We have slept peacefully and listening to the sea. With chairs and tables outside without any problem."

Gray water and toilet empty excellently, tapping water is difficult due to a modern tap that does not fit a hose. Fill bottles and through funnel into the tank. In the village are shops, bars and restaurants and a churreria / pasteleria. Recommended: Urrácal! Spectacular El Estrecho and super nice restaurant Hakunamatata."
19988,2620232,3,Ralphdomi,22/03/2023,"everything works again today! On the other hand, not at all practical for filling up with water or for emptying black water (too low, not at all suitable). The area is just below the autovía so it must be very noisy. We did not stay there. Thank you to the municipality all the same!!!!"
19988,2609132,1,barcusovernight,14/03/2023,"Still blocked, only takes half a cassette at a time, then let it drain a bit. Not good."
19988,2604889,1,BoxerPetite,10/03/2023,"The sewer is clogged, so black water (WC) ran over the street. So no fun."
19988,2589134,4,Goerch,24/02/2023,Nice place and free water supply. Great. Thank you very much.
19988,2569891,4,dikihotch,06/02/2023,"thank you to the municipality for the provision of this area, the passage early in the morning. no noise at night"
19988,2565295,3,Atoarredondo,31/01/2023,"It is very difficult to fill water. They could change the tap. Otherwise, everything is very good."
19988,2541892,4,bopa,05/01/2023,"Thank you to the municipality for this area. Maybe review the signage which is confusing. The village is very beautiful, clean. We had a good night without any problems."
19988,2538245,4,Norkyautomation,02/01/2023,"On the face of it not very promising to look at. yes there are some negatives but we found it okay.
the name of the car park gives itself to a pub next door, it looked closed but then a load to youngsters turned up. they were playing trumpets and drums. luckily they didn't have the windows open! the local police breezed past a couple of times which was reassuring."
19988,2283551,3,LaMarmotaVan,22/08/2022,"A good point for emptying and filling grays, due to the scarcity of points in the area. The most comfortable entrance is to do it under the bridge, leaving from the town. The ""rectangular"" filling mouth that they say in other comments, is the external part of the tap, a male thread is needed to thread it well inside the tap. To sleep, the floor is quite inclined, I do not recommend."
19988,1887961,2,Webkayaker,13/05/2022,"Difficult access, by narrow dirt road. It can be accessed from a paved road, but it is not indicated that way. The water tap, incomprehensibly, is not homologated, it has a wider rectangular mouth than the usual hoses. A pity, because in this area there are no other points to empty/recharge."
19988,1791376,5,Adria-twin,22/03/2022,"Tijola Town is only 5 minute walk from site.
site is safe enough for overnight.  we didn't experience the dogs barking all night, they stopped early evening and no noise from them.  traffic noise from main road above is much less at night and doesn't stop you sleeping but starts getting noisy from 6am onwards.  poor WiFi signal here.
Use watering can for tap no problem."
19988,1748915,5,MarcL01,06/02/2022,"All services are working, thank you to the municipality"
19988,1747175,2,typHAINE04,04/02/2022,"Interest just to do the services and more? Push-button tap with a square outlet without thread, okay, for the rest it's very noisy at night, vehicles and dogs all the time"
19988,1706442,3,the_only_van_,08/12/2021,"Triangle water hose with small female connection, we had to duct tape the hose to fill water. Few flat places to stay."
19988,1649464,4,andreasliebe,17/10/2021,"Free, well-made VE with good drinking water from a separate tap, cast chemical toilet with separate water for rinsing and gray water drain. Very quiet overnight, but expressway in the immediate vicinity. You can also spend the night in the next town of Cela by the thermal bath and swim in the pool at 24 degrees."

19988,1108215,1,mariohs,28/10/2020,"Painful, stuck to the road, dirty and makes you want to cry"
19988,653817,3,dicrusa,23/08/2019,"We spend a very quiet night, although the vehicles that pass through the national park are a bit annoying, it has all the services, it is a little secluded and lonely."
19988,411432,3,armleb,02/12/2018,"The 2 taps are difficult to connect a pipe, but practical area because there is not much in the area"
19988,345320,1,EddyEddy,20/08/2018,"I wanted to abandon this place during the night, but I was too tired. The reason? The terrible, maddening noise of many caged dogs held prisoner about 150m away. And it is very near the main road. Awful spot."
19988,257759,4,lamity,23/05/2018,"Thanks to the town for the free services, but really bad night with the dogs barking all night and the passage of vehicles over our heads, to advise against for the night."
19988,133559,3,Luc,07/05/2017,"Free services, but noisy area, under the road, and unfriendly environment."
19988,117916,1,Padolo,07/01/2017,"Not recommended, difficult access caravans + 7m, located right next to the road in a hollow."
19989,3197620,5,lunezi,22/08/2023,"We spent one night. Quiet and clean spot, a fresh break in the middle of the heat of August. Recommended."
19989,3174788,5,Custom003,18/08/2023,"perfect area. Quiet, with shade in the morning, a large park (with nothing) but illuminated where children can run a little after hours of travel, water services. Perfect location between tranquility and not feeling insecure. Another small town with great initiative for us. Let's see if it spreads! In the end we left €150 in the town's shops..."

19989,2827127,5,Thomasundsabine,06/06/2023,"Very nice and quiet place supply and disposal available. Large garbage can at the entrance to the alley. We had a quiet night. As already mentioned, there is no signage."
19989,2825778,4,LaChorchaVan,06/06/2023,"Access through a small dirt entrance a little further on (20m) from what appears to be the main entrance. Lots of shade but low trees, fairly flat squares and pleasant views of the town, there are roads nearby but you don't hear much. Water intakes cut, there are no services. Beautiful!"
19989,2808794,5,watimama,01/06/2023,Super parking in the shade! Perfect for visiting downtown and eating at Asador Espadin! Exceptional!

19989,2716412,4,chrisoverseas,02/05/2023,"Very clean and tidy aire. Facilities are fine and good size area for the Motorhome, all slots are separated. The town is only a short walk away with plenty of cafes/restaurantes."

19989,2653724,4,Jorge02,09/04/2023,"All the services are very good, the entrance is not through the houses, if you follow the road there is a direct entrance to me, the GPS messed me up and it put me through all the houses with double-parked cars. to the people for supporting us"
19989,2643919,4,Agustinico,06/04/2023,Good situation Tranquility and silence Individual plots with trees If it is full there is a lot of space in the vicinity Water connection without thread. You have to get supplies by hand The city with a good hotel atmosphere the spectacular surroundings (mountains of 1500-1900 m) There is a lack of well-maintained and marked trails that would be welcome by those who love nature
19989,2641227,4,mthed,05/04/2023,"Grey water, black water disposal and drinking water available to fill containers. Approx 10 motorhomes onsite, almost full when we arrived at 16.15. Nice village, good quality meat at butchers in centre. Great views ! Almost level marked out pitches. Quiet at night, rubbish bin at entrance"

19989,2616490,5,Paator,19/03/2023,"We have spent one night. Very flat parking, near the town. There is for emptying water and a fountain to fill. Highly recommended to spend a night."
19989,2608679,3,NKP,13/03/2023,Possibly good place to stop if you are self sufficient but the toilets were all locked up. Too windy and ground too hard to put facilities tent up. Water was still on though for refill. Town just a few streets away for supplies and restaurants etc.
19989,2591040,4,Beppe2018,25/02/2023,"Very good stop with services! Slept quiet and well for two nights. Absolutly fantastic satirday market until 13 in town, 5 min walk. Beatuiful churches and landmagks."

19989,2567646,1,Joeirish,03/02/2023,Don't go here unless you like loud drums and marching band practising at 11pm. Yes 11pm at night. For over an hour. I do not understand why these people make motorhome visitors so unwelcome. I will never be back.
19989,2563628,3,Natienruta,29/01/2023,"It's great that there are these kinds of sites, but I'm giving it 3 stars because a nasturtium won't fit in there are trees with thick branches that can scratch the bodywork"
19989,2563579,5,mopmop1967,29/01/2023,"I was very satisfied, I could only fill up with water with my watering can, but it was turned off for nothing and not because of frost. Food shopping sights and long walks with the dog top. Thanks to the community."
19989,2563237,5,VainLife,29/01/2023,Great clean and quiet (for being near a city) spot.
19989,2558021,3,Cloe,22/01/2023,The place is very pretty. Unfortunately the trees on each side of the seats are low and tight and impossible to pass under the branches without scratching the bus if you have a coachbuilt. So we are not staying. Damage !
19989,2551802,4,Bajonska,14/01/2023,"Free fresh water (bring an adapter). A little clumsy as you have to keep pressing the button. Free grey and black water dumping. We followed “Waze” routing, roads quite tight. Didn’t spend the night, as we were on the move east."
19989,2541750,4,Cicero,04/01/2023,"Disposal available, a quick walk into town, nice view, BUT unfortunately not quiet, constant car and two-wheeler noise, therefore one star less."
19989,2539669,5,Bas-Ti,03/01/2023,"Our night was very quiet, there were still several mobile homes there. The view is really nice on the city and the place is nice and big. There would also have been water, but we didn't use it. Garbage and black/grey water disposal available. Great for one night :)"
19989,2526885,5,john221221221,23/12/2022,"Superb FREE area with water and waste facilities. large  parking pitches facing the sun. Quiet area 100 metres from the town. Highly recommend. Safe and secure.  This is a free area !
excellent if you play petanque ! The bottom toilet block which is closed also has a threaded water supply outside....next to the bouladrome."
19989,2509908,5,lefortmcjp,01/12/2022,"Exceptional site, very pleasant campsite, rustic but with all amenities, ideal for hikers. In addition, it is very close to the autovia.we paid 25€ for 1cc and 2 people"
19989,2502384,5,Rosaliveros,21/11/2022,"A comfortable, level place, next to the sports center in a neighborhood facing the town. The market on Saturday is great and big. We have slept 7 campers, very quiet."
19989,2494617,4,fan4womo,13/11/2022,"Very good safe place. The city center is about 600 meters away. It's not quiet because the cars of visitors to the sports facility drive right past the mobile homes. What doesn't work at all is the ""dead man's button"" on the water supply, which already has extremely little pressure and no thread! In addition, the tree, directly above the disposal, is only 2.90 meters high! Watch after!"
19989,2478867,5,jolefilou,02/11/2022,"large landscaped free area, nice view of the mountain. shaded pitches, free services with gray and black water emptying, drinking water for refilling. frankly it is a free area very pleasant to use."

We arrived at night and finding it was a bit complicated, but thanks to a local policeman it did not take us to the area. We only spent one night, but it is really very good and it is very quiet. Thanks to the city hall for these kinds of places."
19989,2471297,5,danymaster,30/10/2022,"good area. plot delimited by trees and almost flat, some do not even need to fit. quiet enough to sleep. We spent the night on our trip to continue and had dinner in the town that takes 5 minutes to the center. thanks to the council!"

19989,2438407,5,evavinvi,11/10/2022,We arrived at night and the GPS messed us up. We slept in the square and found it during the day. What we saw was amazing. Thanks for those FREE ACs
19989,2323820,5,pablo_sanz,31/08/2022,We have just spent one night in this free area. It is a wonder. Very quiet night. With gray and black water services and free filling. Last night we dined at a restaurant in the town and the food and treatment were spectacular. The municipalities of the towns of this great area should take an example
19989,2292954,5,Cartageneros,24/08/2022,"Good place, quiet and with the possibility of filling and emptying. Pretty village. We will be back."
19989,2276031,4,SGG144,20/08/2022,"The tap is not threaded and the hoses are narrower. We have arrived at night and it has little light, it is not indicated either. Apart from that, it is very quiet and with all the services operational, except for the toilets."
19989,2203677,4,thegordis,09/08/2022,"We went directly to the Plaza del Rey, taking into account the comment that at the beginning of August this other area was a bit complicated due to the festival issue. In the Plaza del Rey at night very comfortable. Very calm. Just opposite there is another little square, (next to the arch), with a bar with a pretty nice terrace. We had a very good and cheap breakfast."
19989,2063814,3,avinsac,12/07/2022,"The site is very spacious, it has shades, it is clean... but the WCs are CLOSED. They only enable them during the town festivals, which are in the first week of August."
19989,2060355,5,janikromy,11/07/2022,"Great place with toilets, disposal facilities and fresh water (drinking water). Everything neat and free. Nice that places like this still exist. We didn't sleep here, just used the service."
19989,2036780,5,ViajesOnTheSpot,04/07/2022,"First night in a van and as an experience the place is quite quiet to spend the night. It has to empty WC and for drinking water. It has very nice mountain views. It has trees, so there IS shade and it is appreciated in hot weather"
19989,2015109,3,alain1979,27/06/2022,"It has very good possibilities but is left in the hands of the town hall. The emptying area, they could prune the trees. The filler tap without thread. The best is the emptying of sewage. The people are thanked for the attempt, but with little care from the city council it would be 5 points. Shadows and lights for this area."
19989,2012531,4,Nissan-Tourer,26/06/2022,Secure place on the edge of a multipurpose square. Approx. 500 m from the market square with several restaurants (cold beer!). Easily accessible from the motorway. Drinking water available. toilets locked.
19989,1912890,3,Rocinante2,24/05/2022,"A bit of a disappointment for us, could not empty due to trees that were too low, not loading water due to no connection, eventually standing further on the site where we should be was really too low, with shade and a wind that is! And pretty flat too. There are also garbage bins and it is indeed quite dusty, just as well thank you municipality that we can stand safely."
19989,1901757,4,annelisemartial,20/05/2022,lack of size to park and very dusty. well placed near the city with all services...large squares..thanks to the municipality and the mayor

19989,1837379,4,rvanvugt,19/04/2022,"Basically a nice spot and superb initiative of the city, thanks for that! Unfortunately it comes with some city noises starting at 6am, has a lot of low hanging breaches so higher vehicles cannot use every spot and has an absolutely horrifying water tap! You need to keep pressing it and cannot connect a standard Gardena hose. Irritating. Nevertheless quiet enough to have a good sleep."
19989,1825761,3,txu-txu,16/04/2022,Something remote. With inclination. The water load does not have a thread. Calm.

COLLEAGUES: FOLLOW THE RULES: THERE ARE 11 PLACES.... It is not allowed to park in the open space next door. This will cause trouble with the local police..."

19989,1733560,5,LenaBel,14/01/2022,"Pleasantly quiet place with sufficiently large parking spaces, 5 of which are separated by steps, so that there is a distance to the neighbors. Ideal with dogs. The city is worth seeing, especially the baroque church. Everything is within walking distance. Many thanks to the city for this offer, motorhome owners are welcome here!"

19989,1691372,4,stelladearn,17/11/2021,"Peaceful night, yeah dogs bark but it wasn't bad. entrance is awkward but if you turn right before the area you'll see it far left. all services are available by the yellow loo block. we'd use it again if we were this way."
19989,1656171,1,McHeck,22/10/2021,Pretty shabby. The fresh water has an unpleasant odor. Many dogs bark all night. We drove on.
19989,1646179,3,53577984,15/10/2021,Unlikely but pleasant place. free parking which we appreciate. Thank you.
19989,1635502,3,SupriyaManchanda,09/10/2021,"It's okay. there is no noise at all. he sleeps very well. The gray water service area is very dirty, many flies and the tap does not have a thread."
19989,1626659,3,Rafa58,04/10/2021,"A bit lonely area and without lights, but it is better than nothing since there are few areas in Andalusia, near the quiet town and with free water services, thanks to Vélez Rubio."
19989,1566046,5,chikalux,10/09/2021,"Not easy to find the entrance, especially at night, you have to go around the square from the top. Otherwise nothing to complain about the shade with trees and a corner to drain and a water corner, all free. a good night and in the morning we visited the village with its church which is known in the area. Nothing to complain about, if a dog barks from time to time at night ... thank you to the town hall."

19989,1449900,3,breizhsizun,13/08/2021,Peaceful area with all free services just a pity that some pigs don't think about lifting the grid to empty their cassette
19989,1287056,4,Egidux77,30/06/2021,"Next to the vaccination center. There is a fence on the passage. So you have to grab it to pass. Drainage works. Unfortunately with water replenishment it is more difficult because there is no adapter. It takes a thick hose to put on the crane. We just served, not stayed."
19989,1206091,5,michaeldg,19/05/2021,"Excellent free camper place in the middle of the village. Little difficult to find the entrance but it's really there! Gray and black water disposal next to the leveled plots, possibility to fill a container with fresh water as well. Public toilets and connectable fresh water next to the toilets that are in a small building a little bit away from the plots. No signings."
19989,1194886,4,Langar,13/05/2021,"Very comfortable area with its delimited, level and large pitches. Very well located next to the town. It has a large park and field next to it. We had a very quiet day. The downside is that the young people of the town go to the area with their cars to drink, leaving everything dirty, but when they left we were very calm."
19989,1174028,5,Alice.Ramy,15/04/2021,Good area with free loading / unloading service! Quite quiet with a park behind it. Close to the city center and the supermarket reachable in 5 minutes on foot. We have been fine. The seats are level and there is shade. There is only a little bit of dust because the road is dirt. The tap for water loading does not have a thread so either it can be loaded with a tank or you need to insert the bare rubber without attachment ... Thanks to the municipality for this area for free.

19989,408237,4,alisonkingy,17/11/2018,I was misled by the satnav. The Aire is on the last right not the one indicated by the gps. Instead of turning off when told just follow that road to the bottom and you’ll see the massive parking area in front of you. Turn right and head for the little yellow building on your left about 200m away.  Pass the yellow building and turn immediately left. The small Aire and services are hiding down the road with the olive trees on your right.  Services are adequate and the custom pitch is level with trees between. At night there is a searchlight to charge the solar panel.

Better to go to the other side than indicated."

20015,1823963,4,HSAT,15/04/2022,"Located in a very pleasant recreational area, but far from the town, you have to climb a long way up a hill. Being next to the river next to the mountain, there is no television signal and hardly any mobile or internet coverage. Gray water disposal is poorly designed and does not work properly. Even so, it is a recommendable area with a very large and pleasant green area next to the Ebro river."
20015,1794160,3,Qadesh,24/03/2022,"Idyllic location in front of the river and with barbecues etc. As for the area itself... VERY sloping, with the limestone at its peak I'm still tilted, the dirty water is a hole in the ground with an iron cover and the water recharge is like ripped. Luckily there is a fountain right in front."

All services except electricity. It misses a little more shade for the summer. Five minutes away there is a small supermarket and two stores with extended hours that open on weekends.
20018,2656055,5,Marferri,09/04/2023,"Public area prepared with everything you need for the motorhome! Be careful access on the maps and the app does not mark well! The entrance doesn't look like it is, but it is an arch that you can enter and go down to the area to the right! It is very quiet 15 minutes from the center, if you need to buy something you have a grocery store very close."
20018,2651554,4,MiguelGaultier,08/04/2023,"Good place to park and spend the night in the company of many other caravans. Keep in mind that it is a bit far from the town center, if you don't walk a lot, and that finding a flat square is difficult, although there are some that are quite good, for the rest of course it is necessary to use leveling fluids"
20018,2649915,5,Crys85,08/04/2023,"Thanks to Priego de Córdoba for enabling such a quiet, safe space and close to the town, to spend the night and visit the (very beautiful) town during the day. The only drawback is that there are 4 bathrooms on the premises and they are closed, it's a shame, but understandable because it's a very appealing space for teenagers who want to have fun, but there aren't any because the police patrol the area. Ideal!"
20018,2646520,5,juridi,07/04/2023,"perfect for all services, quiet and safe, normally you always have colleagues, the only thing you will have to pull chocks due to the inclination but the environment and everything else makes up for it."

We made a mistake and we stayed upstairs, so we were alone... however we spent the night very calm and well, even the police came by a couple of times. Now, we would have liked to be in the lower area wrapped up and together with other motorhomes and Campers, there were a lot!!! In the lower part there are also the emptying and filling services."
20018,2628012,4,bgoenaga,28/03/2023,Comfortable area with some inclination. Well-kept garden to one side to lie down in the shade. Good land with olive trees next to it to go out with the dog. The town relatively close after climbing a nice hill. Closed bathrooms.
20018,2623604,5,rickimarke,25/03/2023,"very nice place, but a bit wrong. From here you can easily walk to the city center. ATTENTION: On Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. the driveway is closed due to blocked from the market. Possibly the access via the Bomberos works."

It has a certain unevenness, because the entire town is on a slope. With the camper I did not use wedges. Priego is beautiful, especially the Barrio de La Villa. The entrance to the area is not where Google says, but behind, entering the town."
20018,2596314,4,JuanySonia,02/03/2023,"A highly recommended area, although a bit far from the town, but it is very easy to walk. Clean and comfortable.

Access from the entrance to the town, about 650m before or after what is indicated with the browser, you will see the entrance to the city with a roundabout, then immediately see the parking signs. One of the photos shows the entrance: Parque Niceto Alcalá Zamora, right in front of an institute. beautiful town"
20018,2546485,4,josemleon2,08/01/2023,"Eye. Google Maps guides you wrong. You have to enter the town and immediately it appears on the left. It is at the end of the park in a quiet area, at least in winter. We stayed on a very quiet Saturday night. Too bad it's a little uneven. The historic center 20 min walking. A very pretty town. Do not miss visiting El Adarve, the Castle or the Fuente del Rey."

20018,2510814,3,EGPH,02/12/2022,"Access to the area is not clear at all, you have to enter where there are two arches and then go down. The area is very spacious and there is also a park nearby, but they were doing some construction when we were there so it was noisy and the loading and unloading closed. The town center is about a 2km easy walk away and the town is well worth a visit."

It is very IMPORTANT to access it, do not follow park4night browser instructions, put the fairgrounds on the map and the area is in the background. otherwise you will be lost.

20018,1921240,4,rvanvugt,27/05/2022,"Thanks to the community to transform a part of the exhibition area into an area for campervans. Unfortunately, it has quite some inclination, I needed 4 blocks to level my van. The main water tap is broken, but, there's a functioning one at the right side behind the little door for which you need a small connector. Relatively quiet nights, no shade but overall very acceptable. Clean and safe!"
20018,1889636,3,Novi44,14/05/2022,"Rather well located, but no water, obviously no maintenance. Be careful if you arrive on Friday evening the weekly Saturday market prevents you from leaving the site before 3 p.m."

The next day, which was a Saturday, they rode up the trail, so we took advantage, since we couldn't leave until 4:00 p.m., more or less, to see the town. It is a beautiful town, with many little things to see, to spend a day, it is perfect, maybe more days are too many. Will have to go back for more oil"

20018,1767337,1,Antoteach,27/02/2022,"The site is a bit uneven, but with chocks it can be fixed. Of course, we have had one of the worst nights since we have a motorhome. There was a huge bottle of very young children, voices and screams until the wee hours of the morning. They fell over drunk as they came and went to the caravan area to throw up and pee. Horrible! The police were there for a while, but they left without solving"

Quietly situated with some sporty walkers during the day. We were only there with 2 other campers. There are public toilets but they are only open when landscaping workers are employed.

The staff are really very friendly. The facilities are also really great - from a pool with its own sanitary facilities to washing machines with clotheslines. The sanitary facilities are also really well constructed, but the cleanliness leaves a little to be desired."
20020,3268281,2,amni,07/09/2023,"For what there is in the surroundings, this campsite is, in quotes, one of the best, the pitches are quite spacious and the showers, well, the showers are fairly clean, the bus stop to visit Porto is right in front of you. Among the three Campsites, it is the only one that is worth it."

20020,3188620,4,BenjaminGeorges,20/08/2023,Campsite well placed for visiting the city. Do not arrive too late if no reservation. To get to Porto take your bikes there is a dedicated cycle path to the mouth of the Douro then follow the not too busy road to the cable car. We did it with the kids. It's certainly a small 8km but it's flat and arriving in town by this route is a great experience in itself.
20020,3165629,4,Leonie35410,17/08/2023,Very nice campsite. Spacious location. Sea view. Clean sanitary facilities. Large swimming pool with sea view. Take the bus 15 to 300 m to reach Porto or uber around 8€.

Being robbed after leaving Campervan alone on street and broken into in front of campsite while walking at noon. Campsite was delightful, very clean ablutions and a safe haven.

Perfect campsite but a little expensive: 100 euros for 2 nights with a 6.5 meter fitted van 2 adults and 2 children, superb view of the swimming pool on the sea, very clean sanitary facilities.

20020,3100858,3,bpenad,08/08/2023,"I give it three stars because it is very expensive. It seems to me the best option to visit Porto for us ACs. For the quality of the services it would be four stars since being clean, the showers and toilets are somewhat old. Small plots trying to accommodate as many mobile homes as possible. To get closer to the center of Porto, the best thing is an Uber. They are cheap and dog friendly with no problem."

20020,2929580,1,xlaurarebeccax,06/07/2023,"Positive: the location. The place is directly opposite the beach + with the Uber you can quickly get to the center. That's it. We didn't like the place at all: 2 nights with T5: €77.20 The question for what? The place is crowded, dusty, there is no shade. The sanitary facilities are catastrophic - the garbage cans are overflowing and there is a construction site next door."

20020,2801542,2,we2,30/05/2023,"Camping is very well located for Porto visit. Unfortunately, access is very difficult for larger/longer motorhomes with long periods of cycling. The curb is approx. 13 cm high and steeply flattened. We would have damaged our rear apron when driving in. It's probably a known problem, since the lady immediately nodded her head when we asked and looked at our camper van and agreed with us."

20020,2747841,2,EberhoferOnTour,14/05/2023,"The reception was very friendly. If you haven't reserved, you have to be quick. The principle “first come, first served” applies here. Pitches are okay. Rather something for small campers. The location for exploring Porto is great. You can cycle along the water to the city. As far as the sanitary facilities are concerned, these are a disaster. Very simply kept, partly broken and not particularly clean... That's why only 2 stars from us."

The sanitary facilities at the swimming pool have already been renovated and there were 7 clean showers with warm water, the other facility is currently being renovated.

The yellow bus and blue bus formulas allow you to move around and in the city with the option of a cellar visit, and a cruise on the Douro (50 mins) for a very low price.

20020,2372057,3,koenhubregtse,14/09/2022,Stayed here for two nights. Handy campsite to visit Porto +\- 30 minutes by bike. Also a nice boulevard where you can eat well. The sanitary facilities are very outdated and dirty.
20020,2327788,5,xikito,01/09/2022,"€8.80 for emptying and loading water, friendly concierge staff, looks like a good campsite"
20020,2318993,4,hfg1993,29/08/2022,"You pay a bit expensive, 26 euros a van and two people, just one night. But it is well located to go to Porto. You can take line 15 (leaving the campsite on the left along the beachfront) and it leaves you at Gaia (€3). Then you take it back to the campsite."
20020,2309482,4,babybruno87,27/08/2022,"The staff is very nice. It takes about 20 minutes by bike to get to the port wine cellars in Porto. Good location. Beach and playground directly opposite. Some beach bars and restaurants nearby. Sanitary facilities are old and worn down, but clean Bulli without electricity for 2 people for €28. Price/performance ratio is therefore quite good."
20020,2304709,4,ibeasko90,26/08/2022,The campsite as such to rest meets expectations. It has a large swimming pool with sea views. And the sunset can be seen from the beach in front (just across the road). We went to Porto by bus line 15 (stop 200m turning left leaving the campsite on the beach sidewalk) and it leaves you at Gaia (jardim do morro stop). Very close to the Luiz I bridge.
20020,2299320,3,Bibichat74,25/08/2022,"Very convenient for visiting Porto, by uber €16 for 6p +1 bb. small campsite but which does the job, the 3 stars are for the friendliness of the girls at reception!! otherwise correct sanitary facilities, no supermarkets but two or three basic necessities on sale at reception. no late arrival because ticket office closed at 9 p.m."
20020,2241454,5,siggimueller,15/08/2022,"Campsite, sanitary facilities are OK... The water for showering is very warm and pleasant. For a washing machine €6.00 and a dryer €6.00 it has become very expensive. Large swimming pool also suitable for children. You have to cross the street to get to the beach, but no problem. We can recommend this place…"
20020,2237457,4,Vanatoutou2,14/08/2022,"Campsite well located for getting to Porto by bus. Line 15 to 200m (however, the bus no longer runs at night and random schedule. Pedestrian and cycling route of about 15km by the sea possible. Beach at the exit of the campsite. Narrow camping place or anarchic location, complicated with a large Cc to maneuver in. 73 euros for two nights, 2 people, 1 vehicle and electricity in August."
20020,2196858,4,braco77,08/08/2022,"Better than I expected from the comments. Correct plots, enough to get an awning, table and chairs. Clean pool, unattended, large, with grass and sun loungers. Old but clean bathrooms. You can buy bread at the bar. You can ask for an uber and in 15 minutes you are in the center of Porto. There is a nearby bus stop. Nice walk and many bars, near a supermarket."
20020,2187629,5,LesCigales34,06/08/2022,"Very clean campsite, with all services: city stadium, large swimming pool, games room, etc. Beware of the price in August: motorhome 6m electricity 2 adults and 2 children: 45 euros."
20020,2160766,3,LaurenceK.,02/08/2022,"Positive: Reception reception (possible in French) and very friendly guards. Near Porto, accessible by foot 24 km round trip (done in 1 day). Nice swimming pool. Negative: no delimited plot, rather ""parking"" stuck to the neighbors (sardines are sold in the region as a souvenir object...). No trees, no shade."

20020,2142032,3,Javisag,29/07/2022,"Correct price-quality ratio. Ideal swimming pool, recent and with new bathrooms in it. The rest of the old bathrooms. Attention with bus 15...from 9 PM it runs every hour to return from Porto...and it's quite an experience!! We were waiting at the stop for more than 1 hour. Uber to go 8 euros... return 15. The bus 1.80 euros."

Maybe a little expensive but in the area I think nobody charges less. We paid just over 30 euros for two people with electricity in June."

20020,2062542,4,Guiem78,11/07/2022,It is not a big place but perfect to visit the city of Porto. About 10/12 euros in Uber. The best thing about camping is the swimming pool. 43 eur 4adults (children under 13 pay as an adult) and motorhome without electricity.
20020,2038647,5,GooseandSwan,04/07/2022,"Pleasant fully serviced campsite opposite beach. 300m walk to bus stop to get into Porto. Close to beach bars and cafes. Nice walkway along beachfront.

20020,2037012,3,indio1903,04/07/2022,"Chaotic campsite, unmarked pitches, narrow streets. If you go with a large motorhome, some difficult places to maneuver."
20020,2024931,5,FridaJanz,30/06/2022,"A campsite with a little bit of charm and old (but clean) sanitary facilities. But the location is really great: the sea just across the street and the bike path to Porto! Just drive as close as possible to the water, then you will be at the Luiz 1 bridge in about 30 minutes. I had forgotten my ID at the reception, they sent it to me in Germany, great service, thank you!"
20020,2022857,4,chrisetbruno,29/06/2022,very good campsite little bus hassle when returning from Porto the 8 p.m. bus forgot to pass we returned by taxi for 12 euros shared with another couple from the campsite in the end no more expensive than the bus
20020,2006814,3,monk50,24/06/2022,"Good campsite facing the sea, friendly French-speaking staff, nice swimming pool but not heated, dilapidated but correct sanitary facilities, correct pitches as well. For a restaurant, go to the ""burger and beers"" on leaving the campsite on the left 200/300 meters away, very good quality burgers and pizzas."
20020,1997033,3,paulgo,21/06/2022,Proper and clean facilities. Satisfactory location but count 35€ per night for a CC of 7.50m and 2 adults. Close to the bus stop for Porto bus 15
20020,1996143,4,SarahChrisW,20/06/2022,"Good Orbitur campsite to explore Porto by bike (pleasant 30-40 min ride along the coast/river). Facilities are not the newest, but were clean!"
20020,1983114,3,sinayessir,16/06/2022,"We arrived around 11 a.m., which was absolutely necessary, since all free seats were taken by 12 p.m. The sanitary facilities are very run down, but are cleaned regularly and thoroughly. We had very good WiFi reception in our van. The bus stop is 200m from the campsite (€1.90 per person, 30 minute journey). With the e-scooter you can be in the city in 15 minutes."
20020,1945288,3,tobiandlaura,04/06/2022,We stayed there for one night (2 people and 1 camper and electricity) and paid 29€ for it which is way too expensive for the quality of the campsite. Wifi is only available in the bar and is very poor. Showers and toilets are okay.
20020,1912300,4,MoiraDiacoluca,24/05/2022,"We went in April 2022 in a motorhome. The bike path is right in front of the campsite next to the sea. A beautiful ride! we paid 19 euros a night. The showers are good, although you have to walk a bit. the laundry service costs 7 euros."
20020,1843083,2,gajettelaiv,21/04/2022,"6€ per person just to use the showers, no other services included. 5€ more if you want to bring in your vehicle to fill up water/use dump station which is ridiculously overpriced. It would've almost cost us the same price to stay the night but they were completely booked on Easter weekend when we were there."
20020,1840943,2,Mollypapero,20/04/2022,"60 euros two nights out of season. It is only worth it for the proximity of Porto. It is old, no wifi on the pitches and some are not level. At the moment the most useless and expensive of our holidays in Portugal."
20020,1839479,2,vdvelde77,19/04/2022,Bit amateurish. Reception does not know if there is still room. Take a look and then come and tell me where you stand. Everything close together. Plumbing is very dated. Price-quality is not in proportion. Very close to the beach.
20020,1836143,4,movastar,18/04/2022,"Great place and good location. The proximity to the beaches is also great. Reservations are currently advisable. Sometimes you have to try calling more than once to reach someone! If everything is full: towards the mouth of the Douro there are many opportunities to stand freely, especially on the side streets."
20020,1796740,4,Schildberger,26/03/2022,"We were lucky and got a parking space in the evening. Friendly welcome. The location is great. Directly on the sea and the city center easily accessible by bike. Unfortunately, the ground from our pitch was so muddy that everything was muddy. We could still use the WiFi from the lounge in the camper for this. Sanitary facilities no longer the youngest, but clean."
20020,1796470,3,sprintervanmm,26/03/2022,"Unfortunately, nothing works without a reservation at the moment"
20020,1772212,4,HaMoSprinterVan,03/03/2022,"For a campsite in the big city, it's great there. Everything is a bit old, but clean. You stand safely and the connection to Porto is great - we rode our bikes, which is also very easy to do without an e-bike. There are some restaurants nearby."

20020,1741594,3,iretol,26/01/2022,"It is quite good, in front of the beach a nice walk very friendly people, very close to visit Porto. The only drawback is that in winter the services are quite cold since they are open, like a large gym, a lot of air enters"
20020,1733677,5,otzko,14/01/2022,"Arrived on Sunday afternoon, we did not stay because the Covid test was compulsory (25 € / person) Return the next day because the Covid test was no longer compulsory and a two-night stay. Easy access to Porto by bike via the cycle path or bus 15 which left us in Villanova de Gaia 500 meters from the Eiffel bridge. € 19.50 / night for a 7.50 motorhome and two people. Electricity included"
20020,1732652,5,Rick.,12/01/2022,Very helpful people. Close to the bus (line 15) to Porto for €1.90 per ticket. The bus takes about half an hour. A good alternative is the Uber. Costs around €5 and takes 15 minutes.
20020,1729395,3,Rli,08/01/2022,"Fairly empty in early January. To access it, you must have the health pass AND a negative anti-genic test (to be found in a pharmacy 4km from Gaia Jardin, Vila Nova de Gaia. Allow one hour and 25 euros per person). We paid 19.17 euro for a van, 2 people and electricity."
20020,1703107,3,teeneeweenee,04/12/2021,"Camping careless, sanitary facilities are getting on in years. Hot shower. Entrance manned around the clock, you feel safe. 2 people, vw bus without electricity 16 euros. Bus right in front of the door, straight to the center. Nice cafes and supermarket around the corner. Good WiFi at the wash house."
20020,1699539,3,josselineroland,28/11/2021,This campsite displays the Acsi sign but does not charge the price. In November 23 € with 6A electricity. The only positive point is that you can easily go to Porto by bus 15.
20020,1698831,4,Lulupole,27/11/2021,"The campsite is okay, but doesn't look like much else. From there you can get to Porto very quickly and the beach is also right across the street. Another advantage is that you can make reservations online."
20020,1671320,4,Daniel_87,31/10/2021,"Not the most beautiful place from the outside, but the place itself is perfectly fine. The sanitary facilities are not the newest but still ok. Staff very friendly and helpful. With the bus 15 (bus stop 200m further left on the sea side, no more sign on it) you can get directly to Porto without changing trains. The beach and playground on the beach are very nice."
20020,1670159,4,park4night1382,30/10/2021,"We did not spend the night, we only used the shower service, € 4.15 per person. It is open out of season, the bathrooms are clean, the water is hot and without time, you can plug in a hairdryer, and also empty gray water tanks and other services. All correct, highly recommended for vans without a shower inside."
20020,1665545,4,Roland2020,28/10/2021,"Nice, aging campsite. Partly shaded pitches with electricity. Sanitary facilities very simple and not very clean. The provision of paper hygiene toilet covers should be emphasized very positively. Short walk to the beautiful beach with various restaurants, bars and shops. Very cheap bus connection to the city."
20020,1662872,5,EmmanueleVallon,26/10/2021,"Good stop near Porto 20 minutes by bike along a superb coast, quiet campsite with correct and clean sanitary facilities as a bonus washing machine with washing line"
20020,1652566,3,pietoke,19/10/2021,"Like most campsites in Portugal and Spain, it looks shabby. Plumbing is really outdated. The location really makes up for a lot. It's a beautiful walk to town! You end at the famous bridge and Porthuizen such as Sandeman….Taxi back to the campsite about 15 euros."
20020,1627823,1,Gudrun_59,05/10/2021,We didn't like it there. The sanitary facilities are outdated and dirty. It was enough for one night. The pictures on the net do not reflect reality.
20020,1627175,3,ladridolibre,04/10/2021,"We only went in passing to shower. It cost us € 5'80 per person, something expensive for what they offer. The facilities seem old and somewhat neglected, lack of hygiene in the showers, but a good option to get out of trouble."
20020,1615590,4,Patognomonika,28/09/2021,"General opinion: Good, I would repeat again. Negatives: Camping with old facilities, the pitches are not well limited. Good things: First line of the sea, good atmosphere. The bus to Porto runs every 15 minutes. We went by bike, it is a very beautiful route along the shore of the sea and the Duero. And to return to the night without problem by bike too."
20020,1615283,2,Pegasus1905,28/09/2021,Good for those who like to camp close to their neighbors; many permanent campers.
20020,1611182,4,AntonioBernalPastor,27/09/2021,"A good place to be, it is next to the sea a very pleasant place, a bit far from the historic center, the bus does not take much time but hey makes up for how spectacular Porto is, the squares are not very big but enough"
20020,1581506,2,bp74,15/09/2021,"For those who like ""tourist factory"" campsites, no worries. Small pitches, no control of the installations so it quickly becomes a mess. Clean facilities but nothing fancy. Anyway… Personally, I don't like it. Fortunately the staff are friendly. For my part no more than 2 * therefore."
20020,1579290,1,oukiva,15/09/2021,"Avoid especially for 30 euros per night in September !! Electrical boxes with hanging wires with normal plug! Prefer the other campsite a little further away or the parking lot facing the superb sea at 300 meters ... nobody, seen sea, very clean .... I do not understand this rating above 3.5 ... it deserves only 2.8 max ...."
20020,1543478,1,AnNiMiNi,03/09/2021,We drove on
20020,1543228,5,lisakhb,03/09/2021,Great campsite. Close to the beach and fast in Porto with the Uber. Showers and toilets are clean and the staff friendly. Absolute recommendation :)
20020,1536582,4,marlenecommon,01/09/2021,"Place is right on the beach. The sanitary facilities are in order and clean. Price-performance ratio top! About 15 minutes by taxi / bus / Uber to Porto, about 10 €."
20020,1486208,3,maydavan,20/08/2021,"One night 2 adults and 1 van 29'90 € The showers are good, and some toilets too. The pitches are not very big and hardly have shade. The bus nearby to go to Porto € 1.90. We did not want to suffer the robberies of the city and we found the campsite safe. It was very full of long-stay caravans, and we did not feel much privacy, but we slept very well. The staff was friendly."
20020,1478059,1,FraGhi,18/08/2021,"After calling and then confirming our reservation by email, we had the unpleasant surprise of not having a place. Lack of professionalism or I don't care. We will not come back to that."
20020,1467667,4,fuzz00,16/08/2021,"Small and very quiet campsite, sufficient bathrooms, very clean and accessible. The pool with good views and perfect. A bus line takes you to the center of Porto in 30 '. Right in front of the beach. With bar-cafeteria and games room with ping pong table and billiards."
20020,1433478,4,laureniki,10/08/2021,"A little run down but very clean campsite. Easy to access, beach dumpsters nearby, magnificent cycle path along the coast to the Marina of Douro (3km) and Porto (8 km). Perfect soccer field for children and well maintained swimming pool. Little more for the French, they accept Chèques Vacances!"
20020,1416184,5,yunakira,07/08/2021,"Camping next to the sea, very correct price, with all services, has a swimming pool, and also at the exit of the campsite, there is the beach, with a great promenade through which you can go by bicycle. Near the center by motorcycle about 15 minutes. We spent one night and very quiet. I would go back again if one day I went to Porto."
20020,1405140,3,Albertoyester,04/08/2021,"A good campsite to visit Porto, it is a bit old and not as clean as one would like, but it is small and cozy, the people at the campsite are very friendly. The emptying and filling of waters very well. The bus stop is 200m away and to go to Porto you have to take line 15. The price has been € 77.50 for two people, one child, motorhome and electricity for two nights."
20020,1374524,5,poliloco75,28/07/2021,Very good site. Everything very clean. In front of the beach. It is perfect if you want to spend a few days and visit Porto. Bike path almost reaches the iron bridge. There are about six kilometers from the campsite to the center of Porto. The price is not bad for all the services it has and the quality of it.
20020,1340922,3,Remolin,19/07/2021,"Camping to visit Porto ... and little else. We only did one night, but we found the bathrooms flooded with water (it looked like they had been cleaned with a Karcher). Maybe it was something specific because we weren't there any more days"
20020,1311155,5,independentravelers,10/07/2021,"I don’t understand why people shared bad reviews. We stayed one night and was great. The pool is amazing, there are also some camping areas with wifi. We were working from the caravan so it was super useful! The staff super friendly, and SAFE."
20020,1303145,4,FrenchRover,07/07/2021,Very good by Portugal standards. 100 m from beach and a bike track that takes you all over. 6km to Centre of Porto. Usual Stalin era toilets but they are clean and work. Great pool but too cold to use.
20020,1291411,1,adrianfeijoorey,02/07/2021,"Exaggeratedly expensive, the facilities are very old and only the pool is saved. At the nearby municipal campsite the night is € 20 cheaper but without a pool. In my opinion it is not worth what it costs."
20020,1291401,1,cris_pirina,02/07/2021,Very expensive for the service it gives. 5 minutes away is the municipal camping at a much cheaper price.
20020,1282292,3,flesireitz,27/06/2021,"Camping is okay. Really a little expensive. The sanitary facilities are old but okay and clean. The proximity to Porto is great. By bike along the coast. The first half is on a good bike path, then along a fairly quiet road. Relaxed cycling, even with a child in the trailer. Playground on the campsite actually not usable. There is a great, new playground directly opposite the entrance."
20020,1248219,3,ninafa,11/06/2021,30 € is way too expensive for too old sanitary facilities. From here there is a bike path directly into the city. There are a few restaurants by the sea. The restaurant on the CP was still closed. With a taxi into the city approx. 15 €
20020,1232080,4,averroes,02/06/2021,"The girl at the reception very helpful, they have just cut the grass into plots and opened the restaurant, little shade but that does not have problems with branches; very expensive electricity, only Interesting for fixed campers who have all kinds of appliances; good location, 2 restaurants on the left at 200m, Casarão (cheap and good) and Mar a Vista on the beach."

20020,139414,1,dago,30/05/2017,"In renovations, so noise and uncomfortable, ultra-hot water shower women. General equipment very old. Electricity outlet without land, for reception open from 9am to 19h, so we must provide the washing machine chips before and we can not leave before 9am in the morning. No pool until June 1st. In short 24 € for a van, 2 adults and electricity for one night, it is much too expensive, night payable on arrival. I understand why now."
20020,133572,2,yvonrcc,07/05/2017,"A bit expensive for the benefits. Very convenient, the N 15 bus that drops you in the city center. The return is made by very narrow streets. The dexterity of the drivers is impressive."
20020,130512,4,8usti,23/04/2017,"Camping in good condition, despite the fact that the bungalows are taking over the place ... The plots are not very spacious and less if some rude motorhome climbs half a motorhome in the neighbor's plot having the site in his ... The bathrooms old but his condition is acceptable. The best is the walk and the beach that is on the outside and the ""proximity"" to Porto."
20020,127592,4,Paolo71,15/04/2017,Cozy and clean a stone's throw from the sea. well connected to Porto.

20020,122301,5,4647c,07/03/2017,I agree with the previous comment. Easy access. Pleasant and kind welcome in French. Great starting point for visiting Porto with bus 15 which takes you to the old town. Practically deserted at the beginning of March.
20020,121039,5,amikase,23/02/2017,Orbitur chain campsite. New administration for 2 years. Bus 15 at 200 m. Just the return from Porto with the bus that skims the walls is worth the trip. Super clean. Nice. Good plan for visiting Porto. In high season it is better to book. (351)227 814 730
20020,114606,3,Toucanos,19/11/2016,"Can be noisy in summer but I don't know of a soundproof campsite in high season 20 m from the ocean; it's very clean and really doesn't need to be renovated yet. Very easy to find and a good base for visiting Porto. The water pipe does not need a nozzle since it is long and can be filled directly. One last point for lovers of surf casting, it's great"
20020,110200,4,luigiluna,16/10/2016,"Convenient for visiting Porto, sanitary facilities a little ""tired"" but clean, health record for the dog to present, be careful to fill up with water, connection larger than in France and as there was no pipe at the end tap !"

20020,87772,4,Lowa,01/08/2016,"Nice campsite, good welcome. Very practical for visiting Porto: you will be given the bus timetable at reception. The stop is 300 m away and the bus takes you to the heart of Porto in 30 minutes. The campsite faces the sea and close to the beaches of Vila Nova de Gaia. Swimming pool in the campsite but a little cool! Lots of wind (at the beginning of July): it curdles in the evening!"

20020,80537,1,vicou,09/07/2016,"Really not top, in July 30 € for 2 people, 1 teenager and camper, no place bounded. We find ourselves sticking to someone since everyone gets as he wants and of course it abuses, not maintained and pool maybe, but even in the month of July icy! We do not recommend. We finished at the campsite Salgueiros at 100 m and the super for 11 €"

20020,53939,4,skehiha13,06/09/2015,"Camping near the superb beach of Vila Nova de Gaia. Cheap, good services. Choose a taxi for visiting Porto rather than a bus."
20020,53638,2,bounty86,03/09/2015,"Too bad because the pitches are very poorly demarcated, no shops nearby. Passage every 10 minutes of planes landing in Porto. maintenance of the toilets and showers has not been done for 2 days. On the other hand, nice welcome. If you have dogs and no means of transportation, the buses that connect Porto do not accept them, so I am very disappointed."

Once finished and paid I had to call the hot line because I did not receive the email with the QR Code, very responsive and I was able to return. Sloping paved land. We were 2 CC. Very quiet night. Sanitary not very clean. NB: If you do not have a NIF number (tax identifier for Portuguese people) put any number but the zone is mandatory"

We pre booked online on our laptop. Several vans tried to register online via their phones when they arrived but failed to pay. After calling the mobile number displayed on the board by the barrier someone arrived to let them in.
The toilet block looked just as dirty after the cleaner had been today."
20021,2609258,4,Guus70,14/03/2023,"Neat clean camper place. Registration via telephone did not work, via laptop it did. We were really looking forward to a nice shower, but the water is stone cold. Therefore 4 stars instead of 5"
20021,2606827,3,diego66,12/03/2023,"The place itself is nice, tidy and with a pleasant view. It is also very quiet and therefore guarantees rest. Cumbersome access, but nothing impossible. What I don't like is the slope of the stalls: whichever way you stand, you are always inclined and wedges are essential! They could have leveled the surface. Still fine for one night and to recharge the batteries."
20021,2605772,4,ElVeterano,11/03/2023,"We are here today and there is only one other camper. Warning, if you have a wide or long camping car DO NOT try to access this from N359 Nisa as the baragem to the North West of here is very narrow. We are 2.20 wide and 6.70 long and we just fitted across!"

20021,2569712,1,Manologc,05/02/2023,"This was a very nice and good place, always full of people, but since they fenced it off, it looks like a jail and it's an odyssey to get in apart from the fact that people who park outside the premises like us are forced to enter or leave! You have to look for alternative places since they don't want tourism there!!"

We have just spent three nights there, it's really top for those who love nature and peace. The service area is functional, gray and black water, as well as drinking water taps. I do not speak of sanitary since we are not users. Regarding the logo on the height limit. No limit found."

20021,260097,2,SEN55,28/05/2018,"I confirm everything that says Alain 85, it is shameful and absolutely inadmissible! See photos of attached. Maybe Europe should do some checks and sanction the municipalities that receive the subsidies and leave everything behind. It's really a waste to see this beautiful achievement in this state."

And bathrooms with showers but cold, it's more than enough to spend a nice weekend but the evening of 8 September to 19h arrived a group of Portuguese motorhomes to the number of 18 motorhomes and Arrived a little on conquered land, made us move for some and even had the indecency to move my two armchairs and my table to accommodate a camper to 1 m of months and even wanted to place one in front of me. I got angry and took pictures because as I told them. In case of fire it was not possible fortunately that one of them who spoke French a little calmed the situation without notifying us. They partied in music late in the night at the very loud musical sound, plus a lady told us you foreigners go to campsites. It is we who paid for this area (wrong on the entrance panel there is indicated European fund) and we foreigners go there because it is free and there is the Portuguese sun as I indicated at chief. We make sure in advance of the possibility of parking 18 motorhomes in the best safety conditions"

20021,122151,3,boucol@orange.fr,05/03/2017,"Very nice place, unfortunately the emptying cassette is impossible. Everything is stuffy as a result of small malignant who have emptied anything in it. In addition, one can attend the spectacle of non respectful English who empty their gray water anywhere, the picture is taken. And after that we are surprised that motorhomes are badly seen in Portugal."
20021,110123,5,forcat,16/10/2016,"Just add that in fact, there are many electrical outlets in the bathroom. After it seems possible with an extension of power to connect, but then try to get as close as possible"

20043,2089432,1,sonjaaufreisen,18/07/2022,The driveway that Google wanted us to take was not even feasible for a car. We rolled out backwards after 400m.
20043,2005941,5,TijnWierda,24/06/2022,"Great location to stand! With a truly breathtaking view! See if you can make it up the slope first! It's very steep! With a weak engine, overloaded or large camper you will not get on it and turning around halfway is not an option!! so watch out for that! Also great to stand. Take plastic waste with you again to keep this gem clean."

Pleasant walk for the viewpoint located at 500m. Clean place, no services, winding road certainly unsuitable for large motorhomes."
20043,1468611,5,silvianevada,16/08/2021,"Two nights, one day of climbing. Quiet place, the town is very pretty but lacking in shops and bars."

20043,960075,5,Franondo,13/08/2020,I slept here and no problem the views are spectacular and absolute silence! To go up they are slopes a bit steep.
20043,782871,3,victoriacavellvc,19/02/2020,"This is very steep, with a few tight turns. Once you’ve started the road isn’t wide enough to turn round so we didn’t drive. We parked by the church in the town and walked up. Follow the path from the first hair pin. It’s beautiful. Vultures flying overhears. You don’t need to push your van and drive if you don’t want to. You can still hear the road noise up here."
20043,774183,4,georgiaustin,30/01/2020,"Really lovely spot, very exposed to the wind but lovely to be part of the elements. Lots of eagles. The road up is steep but not a problem at all, it’s solid concrete, we came in the pouring rain and it wasn’t a problem with a long camper van. Beware of the loose farm dogs."
20043,734284,4,Okaily,30/10/2019,Beautiful area. But a lot of wind. The climb is hard ... I was not very comfortable with my van 3.5 T ... but zero worries. The road is well paved

20043,156830,4,aayahverso,23/07/2017,Beautiful place to rest and observe the nature we did not sleep because with the 3 children including 1 in infancy need more dish to spend but otherwise I recommend!
20043,134894,5,sardine35,14/05/2017,"Beautiful place with a magnificent view. Opportunity to see birds of prey and in the reserve the endemic horse Losino. Presence of lavender, thyme ... On the other hand strong climb to access, motorhome of big size to proscribe. A little wind, place to keep clean!"
20043,118286,3,bizitravel,14/01/2017,Good for a night's sleep. Overlooking the gorge ...
20043,112900,5,estei33,01/11/2016,"Very quiet, small car pass at 8am for hiring. Easy access, very nice point of view. Orientation table. Recover your garbage to keep this place clean!"

20043,39807,4,stfC,24/06/2015,"I stayed here one night last summer. Quiet and quiet place (no motorway noise - it may depend on the direction of the wind). Steep climb, to perhaps discourage motorhomes a little big. No problem with a van."
20043,35753,3,Dadou,08/05/2015,Beautiful setting very noisy because of the highway against not down eagle but vultures

20045,2463883,4,MatthieuMonge,26/10/2022,"Nice place, very nice view. But be careful, we got bogged down in the grass below for 2 hours digging under the wheels."
20045,2012610,5,bunnygore,26/06/2022,A bit busy during the day but super quiet at night with only a few vans spread around the dam. The GNR came one morning and saw the vans and didn't say anything. Be careful with the tiny leeches that attach to the feet when going swimming in some areas.
20045,1647087,4,JoanFCH,16/10/2021,"Very good place to sleep, a bit dirty but very quiet, at least in low season. Recommendable."
20045,1501581,3,icalvor,23/08/2021,"The site is very good, surrounded by nature, with spectacular views. However, there is a pier nearby and there was a group of lads with a bottle, with music and jet skis, making a lot of noise. The next day, from 9 am, more people arrive at the pier, with the bike or to go for a walk. Intimacy, little, even a couple of ""onlookers"" who came over, simply to browse."
20045,1423528,5,reece,08/08/2021,"Beautiful spot. We came from the south, being a rocky dirt trail where plenty of clearance is needed, but we didn’t need 4x4. Looks like there is car-friendly access as well. Lake is stunning, though some parts seem to have little leeches. Great find, highly recommended for a stop."
20045,1107276,3,Naya09,27/10/2020,"Attention cyanobacteria! (Photos) attention to your dogs, do not let them drink the water it kills the dogs. We have seen a large bloom of cyanobacteria all over the lake. Accompanied by a strong smell that stings the nose. Otherwise very quiet place, very pleasant sunshine in the morning and singing birds. Very soothing."
20045,1018091,5,SasouK,01/09/2020,"Superb place, quiet at night, no particular nuisance, the view when you wake up is most pleasant; not totally flat, but does not interfere. I highly recommend ! PS: on September 1, no mosquitoes and clear sky at night, moonlight allowing to see the lake."
20045,996857,4,Chicaenruta,23/08/2020,Good site and quiet at night. No services. The only bad thing is that it's quite dirty in the picnic area.
20045,709842,4,litzen,01/10/2019,"Very nice place to stay. Shadow available. You can also find space to stand straight. Please leave the course clean. Ideall for swimming. Very quiet. Only suitable for vans, as access is very narrow."
20045,564088,4,vinc49,20/07/2019,"Super spot, we ate there quietly, but in the evening a small party is installed (it was Friday night) so we moved to the other side of the dam where we spent a very quiet night."
20045,559731,5,Fannyv,17/07/2019,"Around the lake other people were settled for the night but we were quiet on this side of the dam. The layer of sun from the dam was magnificent and during the night the moon was reflected on the lake. Possibility to swim on a small beach. Very calm and pleasant night! As always, be careful not to degrade the pleasant place, bring all your waste (including toilet paper)."
20045,468499,3,CatRyn,26/04/2019,"Beautiful but ... No luck, there are young people in the car who are probably looking for the same thing as me, a quiet corner ... But they are very noisy! I'll have to move ... Too bad!"
20045,462013,5,lesmomos63,21/04/2019,"Very nice place, easy for a Van, more delicate for a camper, the passage is narrow. Once in the park, on 1 km there are a lot of places. You nice, beautiful sunrise on the lake, families come to picnic, very friendly contacts. We recommend."
20045,407301,4,vinangel,14/11/2018,Although couldn’t access properly we parked on the road just before the very narrow entrance. End of the road so no traffic. Quiet night no problems. Good for dogs
20045,223377,1,womoreisender,18/02/2018,"Access for large motorhomes only up to the tropic at the end of the dam. However, drove until 4 clock (Saturday to Sunday) early in the morning cars in the picnic area - is probably a men's meeting or the like, according to a Portuguese. Whether it is quieter during the week, I do not know. Not recommended."
20045,168590,4,Fleff31,08/08/2017,"Very beautiful but only for vans, if you arrive by the dam: the others do not pass. Turn around for us!"
20045,157318,2,8usti,24/07/2017,"The site is not bad, but the periphery of the reservoir is full of garbage from the premises ... a dump, an absolute shame, glass and plastic bottles everywhere, excrement, papers ... That's why the low score. The access for motorhomes to the periphery of the reservoir once past the dike is impossible, some rocks limit the access, only vans can pass. In any case the parking on this side of the dam is the cleanest in the area with trash bin included, with good views and access to all types of vehicles, including motor homes."
20045,101863,5,nico.claire,31/08/2016,"Indeed very very quiet for the night, nice near the lake, continue on the dirt road and 500 m further left little path that takes you to a small land full at the lake!"

20045,75913,4,lea74,07/06/2016,"We pushed further too, super quiet and resourcing after Lisbon actually. The van a little stirred on the way but nothing too bad. Nice sunset. Many, many insects of all kinds! Police 4x4 is passed, big smile and hand sign :) In short, nice stop."
20045,75866,4,Simonvw,06/06/2016,"Nice and quiet, we pushed a little further on the way to not disturb the fishermen and surprise is much better further: oak hammock Cork bird sounds ... After Lisbon it's really at the top for you relax (not recommended for low and heavy vehicles)"

20049,2453103,3,ifarre,20/10/2022,We parked to go for a walk around the town and do 4 purchases. There was no problem. We went to sleep upstairs at the house in the Gorbea natural park.
20049,1470709,3,Jorg3Arancon,17/08/2021,"Quiet and two minutes walk from the center, we have stopped to do some shopping, there was no one else and we have not seen parking indications that made it clear whether or not we could park there, however we have not had problems the time we have left it."
20049,110968,3,dontpanic,22/10/2016,"Practical if you intend to visit / eat in the village. Flat land and seems quiet, next to a football field just outside, but devoid of charm. It is worth doing 3 km more (going straight on the same road) and sleeping in the Gorbeiako parking lot."
20051,2875843,4,mvicente,21/06/2023,"we spent a quiet night, it has some noise from the trucks that pass by on the road. with picnic area and park next door. practical if you are on your way to Córdoba. easy to access and offers all services free of charge."
20051,2619769,1,OzeanienArt-on-Tour,22/03/2023,"Then I moved on.. For me, this is a terrible place.. that would be cuddly camping of the most extreme kind. So much beautiful nature all around, but this place itself, just cold and loveless. I then wanted to stand next to it, in nature.. but everything was full of broken glass. Too bad, I would have liked to have treated myself to a glass of shandy in the adjoining pub :-)"
20051,1934817,1,ansupeval,31/05/2022,"a beautiful place, if it weren't for the fact that there is no drainage, no water intake or anything...we rested for 15 minutes and continued on our way..."
20051,1763692,3,Krambambuli,23/02/2022,"difficult to find (the SP's are behind the bar, only accessible via the bumpy square). But I found neither V/E option nor water tap. At the far end of the park strip there is a nice view of the old church with a stork's nest on the bell wall. Road noise Yes, but lame factory?"

20051,1322147,2,bikefire,14/07/2021,"It is open in part because there is a sign that prohibits bottles and marker tapes. We have not been able to see where it empties and fills because the bar was closed, we have not found the place either, and as I read in comments, it is where they give you the keys. I have seen that the squares are inclined but with chocks it could be leveled. We have only stopped to eat but there is vehicle traffic and it is heard."
20051,863880,1,Nwara,12/07/2020,Currently closed. They have put up fences at the entrances. No emptying area is seen ...

It is too far to visit the city of Salamanca and although it has all the services, it must be said that the discharge of black waste is done in a well at ground level with a trapdoor and without a grate the diameter of a sewer. I see it very dangerous. The area is very large in an industrial estate. We visited it on 08/29/2023."

The filling and emptying services could be greatly improved, you have to lift a lid that is on the floor, and you empty both the gray water and the poty... very unhygienic.

20053,2744030,4,maulan64,12/05/2023,We stayed there for 2 nights. We hear a little traffic but hey it's ok. I took off a star because of the single tap for clean water and cleaning the cassettes. Small Lupa supermarket 150m away. At 100m bus stop for bus 21 which takes you to the Gran Via terminus for 1.50 € in 10 minutes then 5 minutes on foot to the Plaza Mayor.

We campers usually don't bring that much income to the local shops - we are mostly self-sufficient. The water tap on site is closed because it is currently frosty at night. Otherwise the line would freeze up. Even the tugging around on it by some Frenchmen is of no use today. Except that it breaks. The place fits and the city can't do anything for the reckless fellows in the night.

20053,2516063,2,SergioRyCr7,08/12/2022,It is very far from the city and a lot of noise. It has no service and insecure.
20053,2513935,2,mosquito33,05/12/2022,Very noisy and remote. Very bad services.
20053,2513588,1,Pim69,05/12/2022,"We have slept today, a lot of truck traffic and very far from the city. The services are scarce, but you can not ask for more for the price."
20053,2509689,1,rutakikoycia,30/11/2022,"The first impression is....., for two free nights it is expensive. There are no Services. The first one was very noisy due to traffic and dangerous. The city is far away but the city is spectacular. The second night was worse, a bottle, music, cars, shouting, etc."
20053,2506634,4,Obornico,27/11/2022,We spent one night on 11/14 with no problems. We were passing through north and it was easy to find the place.
20053,2502006,1,ingrid-ken,21/11/2022,"Do not go, there is a lot of traffic at night and you cannot sleep, it is on the outskirts of the city."
20053,2501687,3,Rberg,21/11/2022,"the place itself is nice and flat and large, is well located on the outskirts, weekend quiet during the week a lot of traffic. the gray water can be emptied, the container itself is positioned rather impractically. you have to open a lid, then you can drive there, the gap itself is inconveniently positioned for some cars. there is free drinking water"
20053,2489009,4,HelmutMeyer,09/11/2022,Appropriate parking space with supply and disposal. You have a safe feeling during the overnight stay and for the city tour it is best to leave the camper there.
20053,2488727,2,MargaretT.M,09/11/2022,"We have been one night. I do not recommend it, a lot of noise from cars and delivery trucks It is very insecure, it is not guarded and a road passes through the middle. We won't be back!!"
20053,2471082,4,Rizraq,30/10/2022,"We have spent the night and we are going to stay at least one more day. It is not close to the city, but on the way there we have walked without much problem (half an hour). At night we took a taxi, it was raining a lot and we didn't feel like waiting for the bus. The noise thing seemed like a milonga to us, yes, there is a road nearby, but nothing to keep you awake at night, unless you are very sensitive."
20053,2469714,5,catre37,29/10/2022,"Passing through, we only used the services of this area which is similar to a large car park. Very practical and free services. thank you to the municipality for this attention to motorhomes."
20053,2467194,1,Paula60,28/10/2022,"Hello. A lot of noise at night and they use it to do tricks of all kinds, very bad facilities....."
20053,2461190,1,Nano.Gege,25/10/2022,"The noise is impressive, impossible to sleep, there is noise 24 hours a day, there is no service."
20053,2459681,1,akmueller,24/10/2022,"The place itself is clean, has water and a disposal. Otherwise a disaster! Loud late into the night and 6 a.m. it starts again. When the car wash is running everything is surpassed. And it runs late into the night. If you want to go in the morning you are parked by cars!! The only good thing is the proximity to the city."
20053,2459672,1,Peter.stell,24/10/2022,"Very noisy place, no security."
20053,2452416,3,Brunoclaud,19/10/2022,very pleasant parking despite the very close road to the city center the bus number 12 exit from the parking lot on the left going up 800 meters 1€05 per trip
20053,2447340,4,AngelMoreta,16/10/2022,"we have only used it to empty and fill. tap with good water flow, the thread is the typical one that comes in any garden hose replacement. ample parking and level spaces. free area"
20053,2446946,4,Salva1960,16/10/2022,"I spent 2 nights and loved it. AC area of the gas station and free. Level and spacious seats. Only one drawback, it has a single tap to fill water and wash the Poti. A bit unhygienic. I did not take water. Thanks to the gas station for this service, it can be improved."
20053,2441086,3,rpedraza1985,13/10/2022,"A disaster. To empty the black ones, you have to open a trapdoor in the ground that has no handle and that you can even drop the potty into the hole. And the water nozzle is of a measure that is not European. Fatal!!! The only good thing is that it's free."
20053,2439097,5,Carlosb1,12/10/2022,"It is a great place with services. Don't pay attention to negative comments. If you look at the comments on other sites, those who comment about theft etc, you can see that they have other interests to favor a private area. I don't know how the admins don't see this"
20053,2437147,1,PikachuAC,11/10/2022,"The motorhome has grated us tonight, a lot of noise. We will NOT be back!!!"

20053,2416572,3,blribeiro,01/10/2022,"Park with many places, well lit and with a gas station right next to it. However, it is a little far from the center and close to a roundabout, so it can be a little noisy at night."
20053,2412374,1,monikagarcia,29/09/2022,Loud and dangerous!!!

20053,2258636,1,silviettabartola81,18/08/2022,Not recommended ... we have seen weird rides!
20053,2253992,3,Leimanro,17/08/2022,"We have only used it to sleep, and it does not sleep very well because you can hear a lot of car noise, you could also hear young people who stopped there, in the end it is next to a gas station..."
20053,2249722,4,fers23,16/08/2022,I used it only for emptying gray and black water. Does its job. The flow of water from the tap is a bit bad.
20053,2194639,2,beticoluis,08/08/2022,"perfect for loading and unloading water and WC. Terrible for sleeping, unless you have good earplugs. Typical noises of an industrial estate. I think to rest better in Salamanca."
20053,2170670,4,hergarcas,03/08/2022,"Paved, level and large area, with water filling and emptying services, it is really good."
20053,2161605,5,pacote,02/08/2022,Perfect place to rest and all free services. Toilets in the bar next to the gas station
20053,2159458,3,Superchani,02/08/2022,"Large paved area, more or less well leveled, shared parking with trucks and cars. I was unlucky because there was a concert/festival nearby and it was very loud, at 5 am I left. There are also car noises all night."
20053,2156160,5,vickyni,01/08/2022,"Perfect place to stop by. We spent the night and it was great, super quiet. In the morning you could hear cars driving around but generally very well, I recommend it."
20053,2127809,5,gioia51,26/07/2022,"Very comfortable AA with free services, to visit Salamanca, where the parking lot, near the abbey is always crowded, with difficulty in maneuvering for large vehicles, and noisy. Ideal solution, park in Carbajosa and walk or bike to visit Salamanca."
20053,2092402,4,ccadburys,19/07/2022,Perfect for anyone passing through. Safe and noiseless at night. Plenty of space for RVs and good access.

20053,2022901,5,gersansi,29/06/2022,To make a stop on the route is very good... you sleep well.
20053,2022256,5,jean-claude65200,29/06/2022,"To go to the historic center, reach the bus stop by going up the street, on the Repsol car wash side, and take bus no. 12. Superb town."
20053,1975848,1,AxoTravellers,14/06/2022,"In the afternoon it is more or less pleasant. But during the day be very careful, because the locals use the car park to shorten the path between two roundabouts and do not slow down. If you are not careful, they run over you or park you on top. Screams of workers from the first hour of the day. We are 3 motorhomes and 1 Camper and there is no place right now to park... a pity"
20053,1975511,2,globetrotter82,14/06/2022,"has only one merit, that of existing. I don't usually denigrate motorhome areas, because I know what it costs municipalities, but there, apart from the services, you have to like the noise. Nothing very interesting, stuck between 2 roundabouts, and behind the car wash. The services are free, that's what saves her."
20053,1972576,3,CN29,13/06/2022,Free parking and free services no electricity but very good for the night close to the city center gas station nearby with sale of bread
20053,1971420,3,cecea,12/06/2022,"Convenient area for campers in the parking lot next to the refueling station. Quite quiet, loading and unloading not very practical."

20053,1950842,1,olgatronix,06/06/2022,"It is the third time that I spend the night in this area and I have filled the tank in gratitude but this time not because they had the most expensive gasoline in the surroundings, I am sorry but in the end with the difference it is more expensive to refuel than to pay an area and this is the Complicated thing to collaborate with these big companies to loot."
20053,1910517,3,Mmmoustic,23/05/2022,"Far from the city center in a neighborhood that should be quiet at night. Services ok. Only one faucet but each can sanitize with bleach if in doubt. On the other hand, it would be good for everyone to close the black/waste water hatch to avoid an accident with a child or a dog, once used."
20053,1892196,3,Catalina19,15/05/2022,easy access with any ac. asphalted. gratuitous. there is a pump track 5 minutes walk away and a roller rink.
20053,1889725,4,clemtramp11,14/05/2022,"Stop to visit the city for a few hours and eat tapas! Superb, truly remarkable city, calm and airy... The area is quite out of the way, which can be an advantage for spending the night there. Impeccable services, lots of space and flat. Many neighbors in this month of May In any case, thank you to the city for welcoming us for free. We will definitely come back!"
20053,1886343,5,nathypascal,13/05/2022,Motorhome area with all amenities and free water! very good ! we went by bike to salamanca with the top bike path! thank you for this place
20053,1885280,4,gentiane25,12/05/2022,Very practical area for a lunch break. Good restaurant nearby: restaurante Miro Menu of the day for €12 with main course and coffee drink. Also allows you to visit the city if you are walkers 45 minutes one way
20053,1877873,3,df@orange.fr,08/05/2022,flat space on a noisy roundabout difficult to fill up with water but exists so it's a shame that such a magnificent city is not a nicer place and closer to the city
20053,1872867,3,alicialm,06/05/2022,Just passing area to sleep and go. in an industrial estate next to the road.
20053,1865106,4,hponwheels,02/05/2022,"There are many places, it is appreciated! A 10 or 15 minute walk to the center of Salamanca, everything is correct EXCEPT: There is only one tap and people stick the potty in the tap, DO NOT DRINK that water! A real disgust. I preferred to recharge in another place, since there were remains of poop in the faucet thanks to the funny ones that stick the spout of the potty (I put bleach, but still)."
20053,1863316,3,Tebi_design,01/05/2022,The area itself is fine. We had a good night. The only thing is that cars pass very close and at night some Mongol comes out to do the goat with the car and you feel it. A bit far from Salamanca and that is a negative point for the Salamanca city council that with the amount of tourism could invest a little in this. Thanks to the municipality of Carbajosa de la Sagrada
20053,1858748,3,JoaoRicardo,28/04/2022,The area is quiet but it's all cement and there's no green area. it's safe. but it is very far from the center.
20053,1857249,5,swjxw13,28/04/2022,Perfect free stopover in Salamanca especially if you have bikes.. there’s a cycle path all the way from the parking area which takes approx 15 mins.. the route takes you along the river. Water and waste emptying facility on site and Repsol garage across carpark with cafe and toilet.
20053,1844817,4,porsedenmark,22/04/2022,We stayed on night. The site is ok for a Visit to Salamanca. You can walk to the city in about 40 min and part of the walk is along the beautiful river. It is quite noisy though but the area feels safe.

20053,1805668,4,Ratapoil69,04/04/2022,"Large, flat, concrete parking slab with marked spaces on the ground for CC and trucks. Gray water drain directly on the green surface at the corner. The black waters are carried out in the hatch directly opening onto a dizzying (even dangerous) sewer. One and the same tap for cleaning and filling. Preferable bikes to reach the center of Salamanca. Free"
20053,1799479,4,bellcurr,29/03/2022,"far from the city, but to spend the night recommended. very spacious parking and with the possibility of gray and black water, also filled with water, in addition to the Repsol that is right next door there is another low-cost gas station just 2 minutes away"
20053,1795469,1,Haemmi,26/03/2022,"Friday - Saturday: Very loud during evening, night and morning. You have passing motor bikes, cars (with loud music), buses and trucks all night long. Due to the 2 roundabouts, a lot of accelerating cars, some really loud and fast. I could sleep with ease plugs... Next to a 24h gas station in an industrial area, not really nice location and far from the city. Free services - but no 2. star."
20053,1794891,5,fredpas,25/03/2022,Thank you to the municipality for this paved car park which offers all the services. Slept well.
20053,1790933,3,calycj,21/03/2022,Parking not too far from the center (we took 45min on foot to reach Salamanca). Parking in a commercial area with lots of traffic during the day and quieter at night.
20053,1790540,3,jpcath,21/03/2022,"this concrete parking lot is also shared with cars. it is enlightened. trash can available. a single point of water for filling and toilet cassettes, not great for hygiene! gray and black water drainage. there is a bike path below the car park towards Loxam location. city center in 15 minutes by bike."
20053,1785082,4,lianaelmans,16/03/2022,Good parkingspot. A little far away from the city. Close to the city you find a lot free parking areas for tourism to visit the city. To spend the night this area is perfect with some company of more campers around you.

There is water to fill and something to empty. Far from being the most pleasant area, but it has the merit of existing."
20053,1758642,2,vickycanelle,17/02/2022,free motorhome area. a single tap to fill everything (not too hygienic). too noisy at night compared to the road.
20053,1752330,4,marcdop,10/02/2022,"Area behind a gas station and next to a park. Filled with water. The black emptying no longer has that metal grid when opening the green plate, so it is quite dangerous if you go with children because it is a free fall since it has a large diameter. No need to ask for keys."
20053,1750925,4,PetenBev,08/02/2022,Probably the best option for a free aire visiting Salamanca. Easy walk into a beautiful city with interesting architecture. Very busy even in winter Covid times. Thank you commune.

20053,1625594,4,p46ait,04/10/2021,"Very good area. The people at the gas station and restaurant are very friendly. Close to Salamanca. You have a bus that takes you to the center. Next to the area, passing a bridge, is the center of Carbajosa, which has all kinds of shops and even a hypermarket. You can hear the cars passing by but hey, it's normal. The only downside is that it has a single tap for gray and black water. If they fix it, great."
20053,1623389,4,alain1979,03/10/2021,"Quite quiet area next to a gas station with a cafeteria. Can be emptied and filled, pretty clean. It is on asphalt and well lit. Close to visit Salamanca. Some noise on a road behind, but safe and comfortable."

20053,1529515,3,izanmalaga,29/08/2021,"It is in an industrial estate. it is not well detailed where to throw water. As you get to the left, it is drained of gray in a place attached to the fence that does not seem like it. then in front there is a sheet on the ground with a single tap that is not clear whether for black women. and how you fill and clean the black tank with the same tap. I'm sure Salamanca could make one near the center"
20053,1494505,4,avjavi1,21/08/2021,"Well, we have been luxurious. Yes it is true that at times there is some noise, but it is that it is in a polygon.

The service point is in the corner with black and grey drains, water is the same tap for both so disinfect well! It is next to a road but we had quite a peaceful night and it’s very well lit. Main downside is proximity to city, too far to walk and I would think trying to park a motorhome a nightmare. Bicycle or as we did a scooter was ideal."

All that it is to offer parking for vans already deserves gratitude; In this case, the best thing, without a doubt, is that you do not find anything nearby to simply sleep if you want to split a trip. To thank Repsol for the initiative, it is FREE, and therefore we filled gasoil tank and we wanted to have breakfast in a restaurant, but it turned out that the owner is unpresentable and at 9 it was still closed ... Total, dinners and breakfast well (and cheap) in the village. For the rest, it does not have toilets or showers or electricity and it's very noisy (it looked like the M30), but it's still clear that I recommend it, because you have to be grateful."
